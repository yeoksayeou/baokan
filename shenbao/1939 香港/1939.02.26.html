<h3>持久抗戰必能得到最後勝利</h3>
<p>— 馮玉祥</p>
<p>十九個半月來的英勇抗戰，比什麽理由都更充分地說明了，只要我們加緊努力，持久抗戰，我們就必能得到最後的勝利。抗戰以來，×人一天一天地敗壞下去，我們在一天一天地進步起來，只要拿眼前的事實來看，就足够證明這一點。</p>
<p>××用以誇耀人的是他們「勇敢」皇軍，但今天的皇軍是怕打仗，怕中國軍隊，怕游擊隊，甚至怕中國的人民。他們的「勇敢」只表現在他們反戰的行動上。今年一月廿二日大沽口外×軍三千餘人反戰騷動，江陰五百多×兵也在本月初譁變，殺死×司令官，漢口日軍一部準備暴動，事機不密，被捕者有憲乒及陸軍官乓一百五十人，上海日本軍人組織靑年黨，在虹口散發擁護三民主義的傳單。太原×官兵五人因「極端厭戰」在東門外自殺！日海軍高級顧問山阪中將在厦門賦詩厭戰思鄉。在日本，陸軍部有大部份職員加入反戰會，帝大學生千餘人罷　反戰。明大早大等校均於本月八日被憲警搜查，將大興文字之獄。這一些一些事實都不是偶然的，這些反戰浪潮將要隨着我們更堅强的抗戰而變成洪流，冲毀××軍閥的侵略戰爭。</p>
<p>在經濟方面，失業，飢餓，一百萬萬元的軍費，二百萬萬元的公債，全國的大水災，這些都是每個中國人知道的事情，我們都不去說他。只看最近意大利人魏斯博在「我怎樣作了日本間諜」一本書中，憑着他自己親眼看見的事實所說的，就知道，日本軍閥是在用綁票，走私，開煙館，開妓館，開賭館，製造發賣毒品，來籌措他們的軍費，他們窘迫，卑鄙和可憐的情形，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>×人的國際環境由於他的瘋狂行動，困難日益增加。本月十日，××利用法意關係緊張，進攻海南島。我們自己是「早已準備一切陸上之佈置，在島上必與×軍盡力週旋。」卽法英各友邦也在一方面嚴辭詰問，一方準備實力行動。就國際關係說，日閥本想藉此加强與德意之團結，威脅法英讓步，而結果只不過使「與世界爲敵」之形勢更加明顯而已。</p>
<p>隨着我們的持久抗戰，日本戰爭的能力是一天一天地削弱，困難是一天一天地增加；人民和軍隊日益覺悟戰爭對於他們是有害的，起來反對戰爭；而日閥却用更瘋狂的進攻來企圖解决這些困難，結果自然加强這些困難，使它更快地接近總崩潰。</p>
<p>在我們方面，恰恰相反，戰略戰術都迅速地進步了。從高級長官到每一位士兵，他們可歌可泣英勇艱苦勤勞奮鬥的事實，是說不盡，也寫不完的。在民衆方面，從大企業家到鄉村的農民，從老年人到小學生很多都把他們的力量和錢財拿出來，貢献給抗戰。在政治方面，從新彊到廣東，從游擊區到我們的後方，都在步步革新，日漸改善。在經濟方面，淪陷區制止了×人對我資源的掠奪，後方都市新式工業正在建立，廣大的鄉村農業手工業正在用合作社的方式組織起來。在國際關係方面，已經由各國人民對我們的同情，進而爲政府對我們實際的援助，這一些一些的進步，都在我們最高統帥有計劃的推進與指導之下，加强它的速度，向着最後勝利的目標邁進。</p>
<p>但是我們的進步比起戰爭的需要來，還是不够的。我們還要加緊努力，才能完全制止×人的進攻，充分準備我們的反攻，我們的努力應該順着左列的四個方向：</p>
<p>第一，就是加緊團結。今天抗戰時期有個很簡單的眞理：就是×人所希望的，一定是於我們有害的；×人所反對的，一定是於我們有利的。近衛「速和速結」陰謀，是×人所希望的，是於我們有害的。因之，替近衛當應聲虫的人，便是×人的工具，便是民族國家的罪人，所以受了中央嚴厲的制裁。另外一方面，×人所反對的，所要破壞的，就是我們全國的精誠團結，所以我們就要更加互助互愛，擁護國民政府和最高統帥，嚴防×人乃其工具的挑撥離間。</p>
<p>第二，就是更多出力，更多出錢。抗戰以來，同胞們帮助軍隊，勇服兵役，熱烈捐輸，資助國家，這是很好的現象，可是還很不够，還需要加緊努力，一分鐘當十分鐘用，一個人出十個人的力，去從事各種抗戰工作，從前用十元錢的，現在只用一元錢，用十件東西的，現在只用一件，盡可能地把錢和物品都貢獻給國家，集中用於抗戰上，海外僑胞也要更大量地捐輸，就更好了。</p>
<p>第三，就是要注意抗×宣傳，最高統帥說：「宣傳重於作戰，」我們要本着這意思，向每一個對抗戰不關心或關心不够的同胞，說明抗戰的目的和努力的方法。海外僑胞要一方面宣傳我們政府持久抗戰的方針，一方面把所有僑胞的愛國心，都火熱起來，使人人個個都直接間接做「驅逐日×」的工具。</p>
<p>最後，就是開發財富，鞏固我們抗戰的經濟基礎。政府已經有開發西南與西北的計劃，希望同胞們在這個計劃之下，積極努力，海外僑胞們更要踴躍投資，使這個計劃更得以迅速實現。</p>
<p>「能知必能行」十九個半月的抗戰，同胞們都知道了「抗戰必勝建國必成，」一定更能够持之以恒，愈厲愈奮，促使最後勝利之更早到來的。</p>
<h3>今天的廣東</h3>
<p>— 陸詒</p>
<p>【本報特訊】廣東戰地歸來，我們深切的感覺到經過「廣州失陷」這一次慘痛的敎訓之後，廣東的政治，軍事以及一般民衆動員工作上，都有了飛躍的進步！縱然這些進步，僅僅是開端，還是太不够；可是就憑這些進步的基礎，繼續朝着這個方向邁步前進，可能渡過『相持』的階段，而到勝利的『反攻』的。</p>
<p>首先我們從政治方面來看，過去廣州失陷之所以如此迅速，固然是由于軍事上失着，但一大部分還是由于政治上的原因，所謂政治上最大結所在，是由于廣東黨軍政內部之不協調，團結得不够。因此發生許多不必要的磨擦與隔膜，形成了許多的間隙。自從新主席李漢魂將軍主政後，省府與軍隊之間的隔閡解除了，而且在積極方面，力求政治配合于軍事，積極的改善了戰時行政機構，全省設立四個省府的行署，厲行配合着當前抗戰需要的革新行政。同時，由省府舉辦大規模的訓練班，加緊訓練大批靑年的幹部，作爲實施戰時行政的中心的骨幹。</p>
<p>其次，我們從軍事方面來看，由於廣州失陷的敎訓，廣東的軍事當局已深深地感覺到軍隊工作需要之迫切，因此，目前由第四戰區政治部舉、辦政工人員的訓練班，準備調練大批幹部，來充實並擴充軍隊原有的政工機構，他們的鵠的，第一部使軍隊中每一連，都有政治指導員，將來甚至要做到每一排每一班，都有政治指導員，藉以保證政治工作能够深入普遍的實施於部隊中，在戰略和戰術方面，也有了新的改變，基本上以運動戰爲主，以軍隊與民衆自術團所配合的游擊戰和必要的陣地戰爲輔，由于張向華將軍返粵主持軍事，鞏固了廣東各部隊之間的團結，加强了軍事指揮的統一。最後不能不特別指出的，是最近我軍反攻增城克服惠陽博羅等勝利，士要的是軍專當局善于發動民衆武力。使軍隊武力與民衆武力相結合，實踐了軍民一致作戰。才取得了光輝的勝利！</p>
<p>再次講到民衆動員方面，各地民衆自衛團在保衛華南保衛家鄉的號召下，英勇的與×作戰，充分的發揮了廣東民衆光榮的革命傳統。民衆自衛團有的追隨軍隊挺進至×人後方發展廣泛的游擊戰，有的日夜守衛，担任家鄉的肅奸工作，有的塡補了正規軍隊駐防的空隙，使得我們軍隊能够毫無後噸之憂而出去進擊×人。由于動員委員會遣派許多靑年工作隊，深入內地各鄉村，環繞在民衆自衛團的周圍，組織起各個村鎭的抗×自衛協會，使今後的民衆動員，不祇是一個臨時的工作，而已成爲一個以民衆自衛團爲中心的經常工作，民運工作可以從有組織的民衆或較前進的部分開展到無組織或較落後的階層中去實現眞正的全民動員，這裏，還需要當局切實培養民運幹部，糾正狹義的動員方法，使廣大的民衆力量，尤其是在民衆武裝力量基礎最雄厚的廣東，作更多的發揮，加速完成反攻廣東的客觀條件。</p>
<p>今天華南戰局，在表面上雖呈現着密雲不雨的狀態，但這並不是說×人放棄了向我西南淮攻的企圖，恰恰相反的，固守廣州附近這條半弧形陣線的×人，目前正在伺機進攻，它一面企圖『肅淸』後方的游擊戰；鞏固它的佔領，一面正在陸續增援，準備再度進攻，截斷我西南國際交通綫，最近×軍在華南，增兵四師團，×艦的雲集兩粵的沿海地區，郎是×軍即將進政華南的徵候。</p>
<p>從現成的進步基礎上，我們更要加速政冶軍事各方面的　步，發動廣大無比的民衆力量，來粉碎×人對華南　的進攻，這是時局的中心任務！（救亡社特約）</p>
<h3>我國經濟動員中之　工業合作　【續昨】</h3>
<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>七日，工業合作之放欵應相當審愼也。協會各事務所遠在各地，如各項放欵，必須　總會批准自不可能，卽欲逐一請示區辦事處，亦略嫌迂緩。但工業合作放欵，動輒數千，甚至數萬。原料價格日漲，又不得不預為收存，以期符合經　經濟之原則。則需欵之大，自不待言。但如此鉅額放欵，且大半係充固定資本之用，非一時所能收回，如不審愼運用，不但難免流弊之叢生，且將日感資金之不敷。爲補救起見；竊以爲第一各地負責放欵人員，應經担保手續，同地工作人員並應相互担保以便相互監督。第二，區辦事及事務所放欵權限，應分別限制，超過一定限制，應經核示手續。第三，總會應指派審計專員常川分駐各區辦　處及事務所，使放欵不能由一人專擅决定。第四，借欵人應向資金保管機關或人員直　領取以淸手續。雖各地負責人員如能愼重選擇，應可完全信任，然制度不可不求其嚴密，事實上如有放鬆可能再分別酌量减免原定之手續可也。此其七。</p>
<p>八曰，工業合作之業務，須能顧及戰時之特殊情形及戰必後有之變動也。工業合作不能不對戰事有所貨献，故戰時用品之製造；自亦在其工作範圍之內。戰時政府爲維持外匯，奬勵輪出，則凡關于輪出之加工製造；如為能力所及，工業合作，亦自應　之。戰時政府爲維持外匯，又必設法獎勵國貨之生產以替代洋貨之進口，此亦爲工業合作所可効力之處　戰時因兵役法之實施，農工勞動，漸感缺乏，故婦女勞動應儘量利用，使生產不致停頓，並　訓練婦女生活之機能。然戰時之需要，戰後或即消滅。戰時物價高漲。生產成本雖高，仍不妨勉維持，但戰後物價低落，或卽不易支持。且戰後各種大工業恢復常態，擴大生產。合作工廠即將發生莫大之勁敵。其時合作之工廠必如何方能使其繼續發展，亦應預為慮及，故此時合作工廠之業務，應使　能於戰後仍可繼續生產，或改製其他產品，並應選擇適當物品，使戰後市場需要；仍能保持其存在與發展。此於設廠地點亦極有關係，一面固須避免轟炸，力求安全，一面仍應求其交通便利，運輸簡挺。同時，此項工廠尤應注意組織成分之純粹，不宜　各方工人混合組織，以免戰後因江浙工人之囘籍而動搖合作社基礎。並應利用戰時物價高漲。多提公積金，使資力充實以為戰後競存之準備。此其八。</p>
<p>九曰，工業合作應設法引動其他合作事業，如運銷合作消費合作等事業以利原料之購買與產品之推銷，在此類合作未能創立以前應由協會設立供運代辦處，以求各合作社供運問題之解決。此固為求工業合作本身之發展，亦所以逐漸完成合作運動之業務綱也。吾已於前節述工業合作與一般合作行政應有之聯繋，觀於此而益信其重要。實則工業合作不但應與其他合作取得密切配合，卽與其他有關建設工作，亦無不然。此其　。</p>
<p>十曰，工業合作應竭力培養其自治能力，使不致永遠依賴政府之挾持，此為合作事業之根本原則，固不僅工業合作為然。然如能於創設時卽加注意，則他日之成績自必較佳耳。此外，則工業合作社之聯合組織亦極重要。但聯合組織不可勉强，如各社距離甚遠，且內容不甚充實，加以對合作無甚認識，同時。業務上又絲毫不發生聯繫，僅以其同爲工業合作社而聯合之。則必毫無功效可言。此項聯合社之組織，事前如能預為計及，則可爲附近各地有計劃的成立若干單位合作社，並預定於某地成立合作社聯合社，庶乎可矣。窺嘗以爲工業合作之未來發展，將全視其能否運用小規模經營之長而去其短。上述聯合組織之功用，即所以去其短也。此其十。</p>
<p>以上十端，係就愚見所及，略述我國推動工業合作應加注意之處。如能及時注意，則於此新興事業之健全發展，或能不無小補。然協會當局或巳早經計及，而其他各方面對于工業合作之正確認識與熱烈贊助，尤屬必不可少。如能得中央及地方技術機關，各省縣合作主管機關及地方當局之協力推進，庶可事半而功倍，此亦余草此文之微意也。</p>

<h3>披着戰袍的衡陽</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>衡陽，是湘桂路和粵漢路接軌的地方，同時也是我西南交通脉絡的一個中樞，其形勢之重要，可想而知。雖然在現階段中，粵漢路北端武漢，南端廣州，不幸淪于×手直如一脉絡兩端已中了毒素：可是它的後備生力軍——湘桂路，尙健全無病，尤其在衡陽北株州冉和粵漢路接軌的湘黔路，最近又將通車至湘邊芷江，它們都是節節進展，血液旺盛的大動脉，隨時可以源源輸送無量數的白血球，去吞滅粵漢路兩端以及其他失陷區的毒素，以去腐生肌之作用，完成抗戰建國的大業。</p>
<p>衡陽既是個重要都市，×人之欲『得而甘心』，自不用說。槍砲力量，遠不可達，便用飛機常來肆虐。最厲害是去年中秋節及十五，十六連接二夜，都分批來衡肆虐，在北鬥及小西門外一帶投彈一百數十枚，燃燒民房數十間，死傷平民約四五百人。我空軍起而應戰，先後擊傷×機五架，當場落縣境兩架，已將機骸檢獲。兩路鐵軌及橋樑，雖亦被炸，但以鐵路員工認識運輸責任的重要，不分　夜，奮勇工作，總是隨壞隨修。雖然大家明自修好又會被炸，但大家寧願吃苦修好了、讓當天的列車過去明天要是冉被炸，不妨又冉重修。這種堅苦奮鬥的精神，殊堪欽佩。記者從城外遷住城內，天雨剛晴，路泥未乾，就連聞空襲警報兩次；但空防設備相當好，只消按着街頭標示跑去，便有防空壕；同時還有警憲和三民主義奇年團們，指示路由，所以秩序也非常的好。此間政府和社會所組織的服務團體，如軍政部戰地服務員，各軍圑各師部政治部戰地眼務隊，衡陽各界抗×委員會分組担　，慰問，　信茶水各隊，以及鐵路員工或基督敎會等所設傷兵招待所　眞如雨後春筍，不勝枚舉。衡陽抗委會爲了要徵募傷兵棉被，公演新舊戲劇，以賣票收入，作添置傷兵棉被之用。參加表演的劇團，計有軍委會政治部抗×演劇隊第八隊，敎育部巡迴戲劇敎育第一隊，上海救亡戲劇第二隊，軍委會政冶部電影放映隊第一隊，湘劇第二隊，長沙兒童劇圑，長沙流動劇團第三隊，衡陽七七劇團等十餘圑體。一致大賣力氣，一個　一個，都把拿手好戲搬演出來．連演十日，差　多天天精彩，天天都賣滿座。不過票價定得低（定高了恐不易賣出），總計十日的收入，僅有二千數百元，外加捐欵僅四千餘元，終可製棉被五百餘條；但　眞感困難　他們都會爲國家民族在前線拚過生死，而今帶着榮譽傷下來，在氷天雪地中，還要叫他們受寒受凍，我們在後方——尢其在香港，上海，南洋一帶尙能過飽暖生活的同胞們，倘不繼續踴　捐輸，救此富有戰鬥經驗的將士，早得康復，　上前線段×，我們如何問心得下！</p>
<p>這個橫跨湘江兩岸的衡陽市區，她好像是披着件時髦戰袍的女子，從她面前定過，誰都要向她行個注目禮。不過也有例外，記者却不曾向他行注目禮，而是將她當作配備在不前不後的方位的女戰士隊伍，操「閱兵式」似的檢閱過她一次；覺得她的動人的陣容，大致描寫起來是這樣的：</p>
<p>先從她的頭部輪廓——城池說起：城區面積約十六方里，城周約七里餘，城門有七個，南門叫迴雁；東南門叫閱江，俗稱鐵爐門；東門　賓日，俗稱柴埠鬥；東北門叫瀟湘；西門呌安西，俗稱大西門；西北鬥叫望湖，俗稱小西門；北鬥　瞻嶽（嶽四衡山），都典雅得有意義。環城有碉堡一百零指座，全縣共有三百餘座，外加各鄉鎭十數萬嚴密組織的自術團隊，莫不躍躍欲試，亟盼戡會到來，替國家民族流些血汗。</p>
<p>記者經大西門進城，門口有兩個橫持着槍的士兵，守銜瞭望，氣槪非常英偉；另有手執紅旗的交通警，指示汽車的進止：附近還有堅固的防空壕，以備路人躱避空襲。入城直走，沒有多遠，便到郵政局，當時售票及寄掛號快信三處，都擠滿了人；據『問詢處』負責人　君談：這原是二等局，但近來的郵務，已超過頭等局。工作人員亦已較前增加一倍了，可是在事實上，還有些不够　付呢。</p>
<p>快到正街口，那里有兩家望衡對宇的標準飯舖，一家叫『好公道』，據說遠自上海遷來，每餐二角五分，肉菜飯便可吃得『相當飽』，如此平民化，倒也嘸　可是對過那家福建飯舘，以『全用女子招待』號召，而招牌寫得紅紅綠綠的，却未免有點『不合時宜』了。該飯館有樓房三層，中下層賣客飯。五角五分一餐。若吃點　，價亦較貴。三樓專賣點菜定價高貴無比　　飯非三四莫辦，但吃的幷非珍饈美味，不過就是有女招待伴飲而已。據二樓茶房憤憤然談：『男茶戾每月工錢僅十元，掌刀大司務十八元，房租亦僅卅六元，可是女招待工錢竟高至七十元，未免太不公平！』他仰頭向三樓樓口看了一眼，又繼續說：「你不撩她，她撩你——只圖小費多。同時，歡喜這一套的，還有不少是公務人　，此時還要揮金如土，未免太那個了！』這倒不是全出于妒意，而是很有道理的話，兼之，像這一類以女招待號召的飯館和飯店，還有大規模的兩三家，政府縱然不便消極的禁止它們營業，但也應積極的向它們重徵救國捐。高唱已久的「改善士兵生活」的口號，假若大家認爲極有價値，不過就是經費有限，難於實行的話；那我們就無妨採用褒多益寡的方法，先行削減高級軍政人員的特別費或辦公費，拿來做改善士兵生活的經費之一來源一，同時，這還是對高級公務員取締和生活浪費的二種「釜底抽薪」的辦法哩！</p>
<p>走到了十字路口，借「問路」爲由，登上警察的站崗台，四面一望：東路作斜坡形，出閱江門便是湘江；滿街擺着米担，每元可買上白米十八斤至二十斤。南北正街，又稱大馬路，商店舖面，都是西式建築的四五層高樓，銀行，書店，布莊，綢緞舖，百貨公司等等，大多櫛次鱗比的開設在這條街上。路中則車馬如龍，兩旁人頭鑽動，其繁華熱鬧，堪與上海二三等馬路相娩美。</p>
<p>的確，衡陽人口眞發達，據內政部民國十八年調查，全縣計有一百卅十六萬六千餘人，市區人口佔十五萬。自廣州武漢相繼失陷，長沙大火以後，據縣府秘書劉性一君談：城區現已激增至三十萬人。帮助軍隊運輸的壯丁，政府按日發給大洋五角，無論所需數百或數千，均可隨徵隨到、，經常替軍隊服務的，每日亦在五白人以上。這比任何一縣的人力貢献，似乎都要偉大些。若非人口繁密，當然也難辦到。可是衡市人口，雖然如此繁密，但是一聞空襲警報，頃刻間大家居然就躱得踪影不見。</p>
<p>從正街北去，向東轉出「賓日門」，搭船渡「江東岸」。湘水消碧似桂江，但水量深度及河床，均大過桂江數倍，兩岸渡口，揷有木牌，寫明每船渡十人，每人收費二分。江東岸也有很多民房，多數濱江而居。沿江復折而南，到了一條由城通達粵漢路車站的馬路，又有很多麵舖及旅館，多是北平及河南人開的。那馬路通城的這一端，下岸有塊大沙灘，有人露天唱「蘇攤」，唱「西洋鏡」，幷擺設各種游戲小賭博，吸引住很多灰棉袍上縫着紅十字的傷兵，在那里消遣徘徊，流連忘返。這里好像是個天然的傷兵俱樂部，不過所樂的却無意義，關于這，我只好向聚居城中的宣傳隊呼籲了。</p>
<p>從這里過河入城，却有七八十隻民船架成的浮橋，可自由通過，而不取費。民船由公家封用，按人口每日發給生活費角；遇有軍運船隻從江上下，可開放讓其通過。</p>
<p>當時火車剛從前方運到一批傷兵過橋上岸等候集台。有些穿的衣服及披蓋的棉被，委實破濫得不成樣子，但他們還擹帶着體溫的銅子，伸出瑟縮顫抖的手，化五分錢向報販買張報紙看看。他們爲國家民族剛流過血，現復忍飢受凍的買報看，這番關心戰局和國事的熱忱，當時曾使我感動了掉了淚來！</p>
<p>快走到南門時，見軍政部戰地服務團設有傷兵招待所一處，煮好一鍋粥，大槪是準備給這批傷兵吃的。同時衡陽民衆抗×委員會的担架隊，也全部出動，飛奔過江而去，可知車站上還準有一部份動彈不得的重傷將士呢！</p>
<p>總之這個巳經披上戰袍　時代女子——衡陽，雖然她局部的聲色行動，還未全似眞正戰士應有「秣馬厲兵」的風度，但從大飽上　，畢竟，是在武裝着了。希望一般做政治工作的，再積趣的把她設備一下，特別注重城區老弱人口之疏散，鄕村人民之宣傳組織，那她就可以立刻進步成爲英風凛凛，殺氣騰騰的一名眞正戰鬥兵了！</p>

<h3>中日戰爭與防共協定</h3>
<p>— 世長譯　ASIATICUS原著。載一月號亞美雜誌</p>
<p>日本在計釗征服中國的時候，時常計算到將來的「大戰」，甚至於想到聯串的多次「大戰」，但是，中國軍民團結一致，長期抗戰，因而發生「大戰』，這是對於日本的一種侮辱，日本的軍事準備是想攻繋蘇聯，英國和美國，這三個國家才配做和日本爭奪太平洋及亞洲霸權的「大戰」中的敵人—日本認爲，中國的抗戰可以應用「地方事件」和「短期膺懲戰」的特別技術來應付，它在軍略上的主要攷慮，是怎樣免除列强的干涉，對於中國有力的抗戰，似乎是滿不在乎的，日本認爲和德，意成立三角防共協定是很有利益的，因爲這樣，可以防止列强的千涉中日事件，遮蔽了侵略的眞相，而實行從『共產主義』的禍害中，拯救歐亞兩大洲的計劃，日本攻擊蘇聯的目的，可以作爲迅速推進獨霸中國市塲的藉口，獨覇中國市場以後，遠東就變成了一個龐大的經濟根據地，對于攻擊蘇聯，很有帮助，這是當然的，同時，更能够適巧的攻擊英，美。</p>
<p>日本希望從德，意在歐洲和地中海的侵略行動上，得到好處；同棟的，希特勒和莫索里尼也以爲，日本在遠東的行動，對于他們是有利的，因爲日本可以强迫英，美注意遠東的戰爭威脅。同時，又可以使蘇聯在西伯利亞駐紮精銳的軍隊和堆置充裕的原料。德，意的政策是在改變歐洲的均勢，但是並不向英，法，蘇集團（很可能的由美國支持）發生實際的戰爭，這是相日本控制太平洋上均勢的理想互相聯繫的，所以，希特勒在東歐和中歐造成大德意志帝國，莫索里尼使地中海變成意大利的湖，日本想控制在經濟上，政治上聯繫的中日『滿」集團，這樣以後，對於攻擊蘇聯，就有一個較好的優越地位，同時，德，意，日三國更可以威逼一切「中立」的國家，準備最後的控制世界，瓜分世界，日本就可以擭取××，安南，英，美，荷諸國在南太平洋的屬地和利益！</p>
<p>這是很明顯的，日本對華計劃，必須迅速的實行，對於整個的控制世界計劃，這是絕對重要的，日本袛有擊潰中國，使中國政府屈服，加入防共協定，才能利用一般漢奸，建立僞政權，間接的管轄中國；這樣的情形下，重要的港口都喪失了優越的地位，英，美，法諸國的利益，大受損害，漸漸的至於消滅，同時，日本的地位必能够威脅新加坡——亞洲大英帝國的大門——並且能够成立隔離中，一蘇的軍事警備綫，對於莫索里尼和希特勒，這也是同樣重要的。</p>
<p>日本深入的戰爭，不能迅速的獲得勝利，不能不應用大批的軍隊，又不能保留主力的部隊，可以恫嚇世界，威脅蘇聯和其他列强，短期征服中國的夢想，巳經變成行動遲延的「大戰」，這對於日本是够悽慘的了；而且，德，意並不須嬰這種大戰，還有，中國舉國一致的堅决抗戰，强迫日本必須集中大部分的軍力和財力於華北，內蒙，西北的一部，長江流域及沿海一帶，目前我們還不能看到停止戰爭的現象，百萬日軍不能擊潰中國的正規軍，不能制止華方游擊隊的活動，以保護日漸增長的交通線，更不能鎭壓「佔領』區內愛國華人的抵抗，目前日本暫時的勝利，不能消除失敗和崩潰的危險，這不僅是日本的禍難，並且也是整個三角防共協定的瓦解。</p>
<p>防共協定在歐洲也沒有成功，雖然捷克斯拉夫是被宰割了，英國和法國，甚至於美國，對於德，意的侵略西班牙，有了可恥的默許，沒有在物質上供給西班牙政府，這裏，時間間題是最重要的；意大利可說是不能在西班牙得到迅速的勝利而失敗了。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>日機炸新界案</h3>
<p>日機轟炸香港新界羅湖事件，完全是日本侵略者有計劃的××××，與佔領海南島及爭奪上海租界，爲同一企圖的分別表現之一。這　行爲如果再不遭受最嚴厲的抗議與制裁，則將來禍害所及，×××××××××！關於這一點，英政府方面自然是認識得淸楚的。</p>
<p>現在此事由　日雙方在東京和　　　　舉行談判，日方完全依照預定計劃，以『誤炸』及『道歉』，掩飾其破壞香港領土××××××××的罪行，英方對此自然不能認爲滿意，因此交涉尙無准展。</p>
<p>爲了保障香港的安全及英國在遠東的地位，今後永無此種事件；（二）切實保証英在遠東空中航運的不受任何阻凝襲擊：（三）廣泛倍償此次事　的損失。</p>
<p>但是最近歷史證明，法西斯侵略者的任何保證及允諾，都是最靠不住的—因此必項用實際力量來實現這種要求，第一是加强香港和英國在遠東的軍事設備，特別是迅速增强遠東海空軍的實力；第二是迅與法美兩國，講求密切聯合防止侵略的辦法；第三是加緊與我國協力防衛中緬中越交通，同時發展中英法美間的天空交通運輸。</p>
<p>英國的利益和中國與一切民主和平國家利益是分不開的，只有放棄一切對侵略者的妥協政策，只有加緊民主和平國家的團結和援助，英勇反抗侵略者的我國，才是最有力的保障。</p>
<h3>耶敎徒新使命</h3>
<p>中華基督敎會廣東協會，定今日下午二時在灣仔循道會堂舉行該會內地各區堂旅港會友聯合禮拜，爲國難祈禱。並將有關於前方救護工作的報吿，及靑年隨軍務服團團長的演講，我們看到這個消息，有幾旬話要說。</p>
<p>近來東西法西斯侵略者的瘋狂暴行，推進及擴大世界大戰，殘殺人類，毀壞文明，詆辱宗敎，這是普天共憤的事，何况是具有光榮歷史負有偉大使命的基督敎徒—中國敎友，自從九一八事變以來，尤其是從八一三全面抗戰開展以來，爲國難而犧牲，爲抗戰而服務，其表現之偉大，不僅爲國人所共見，亦爲舉世所共譽。其間尤可稱道的，如各地敎友之組織隨軍那務圑，前方救護隊，傷兵難民慰勞隊，以及廣泛動員羣衆共赴國難救濟兵災等，迭　功續。而各地靑年會之經當召開時事演講會，討論會，組織救亡宣傳隊，抗×歌詠團，以及演劇賣物爲國募捐等等，都是値得全國愛國同胞與世界正義人士共致最大敬禮的！</p>
<p>我們希望耶敎敎友，都能認淸救祖國救世界的眞諦，秉承過去英勇赴難慷慨從征的精神，更加團結起來，號召大衆，反對正圖滅亡我祖國毀環我世界的日德意侵略者。新的使命是最神聖最莊嚴亦最迫急的使命，要盡一切力量，忍一切艱苦法完成它。</p>

<h3>快活谷中大快活　春季大賽馬昨日舉行</h3>
<p>— 郎</p>
<p>本報特寫！一年一度，一連五天的春季大賽馬，昨天已經開始了。</p>
<p>昨天，還未到上午十時，許多汽車，電軍，巴士，便載滿了客人，向着快活谷跑馬地進發。電車，巴士擠擁得要命，許多不耐煩候軍的人，都跑路出發，一時馬路上。有着潮水似的人羣，向着東方湧去。</p>
<p>快活谷中，人頭湧湧，千萬觀衆，老的，少的，村的，俏的，都來凑熱鬧，娘兒們穿紅着綠，花枝招展，聯羣結隊地走動着，眼睛給她們弄花。</p>
<p>跑馬塲中心的草還靑，在陽光照耀下，和粉白，宏偉的跑馬廳，五光十色的萬國旗幡，相掩映，很美麗。</p>
<p>快活谷，整個快活谷，動與靜都流露着一種「快活」的氣象。</p>
<p>咆馬廳的大鐘指着十一時半，第一塲的「福州杯賽」，便在人聲鼎沸中開始，大家都注精會神地看，</p>
<p>正午十二時後，因爲所有洋行，銀行……都停止辦公，到來看跑馬的人更續漸多，飛馳着的汽車，一串串，把大批紳士，太太，少爺，小姐送到來。跑馬廳的看台，坐滿了，站滿了人，說到看台也有分別的，有所謂會員棚，是給香港賽馬會的會員的，加入作會員要繳入會費十元，另每年繳年費卅五元，非會員也得由會員介紹入會員棚看，收費是男子每天十元，女子五元，普通棚一律收門票二元。</p>
<p>下午一時半，第五塲「黃泥涌賽』完結後，宣布暫停一小時，給觀衆吃午餐。跑馬廳裏的觀衆都忙到廳內的酒　間去。拿着，富昂貴的菜單向僕歐們點菜，要酒。塲外的一般免費觀衆，也紛紛向附近的食品店，小販攤子，找東西吃。賣生菓，糖果……零吃的小販都利市十倍。</p>
<p>午餐時問中，大家嚷着，說着的都是「馬經」，當然喇，銷票五十二萬五千張的一元「打比賽」彩票是他（她）們談話的主要資料。他（她）們誰也羨慕著二十多萬塊錢的首獎，誰也渴望廿七日「打比賽日」的來臨二誰也相信自己的運氣很好，他（她）們忘記了一切，他（她）們心目中有的都是馬，不，都是錢，馬就是錢喲！</p>
<p>下午三時半，第六場又開始，他（她）們又忙着去看，他（她）們為馬兒着急馬兒與　，也為馬兒　息；整天忙着，贏錢的興高彩烈，輸錢的沒精打彩。</p>
<p>第一日賽馬，有十二塲。他（她）們一直忙到下午六時後才散。</p>
<p>春季賽馬有五天，第一天完了還有廿七。廿八，三月一日和四日四天，在這四天裏快活谷都一樣地熱鬧？每一天都有千萬人到來追逐着，追逐者錢。</p>
<p>大槪有了錢便快活吧（？）快活谷裏有錢。也有女人打扮的華　的女人，有吃，有喝，奢侈的吃，奢侈的喝。有汽車，跑馬廳對開的　地，停着幾百部，華貴的新型汽車，好像開汽車展覽會似的，可是，倘若你會把腦袋一仰，向着快活谷上的山坵一望，那裏也有無數的墳慕，豐碑短碣，一座座分列着——</p>
<p>錢，女人，吃，喝和墳墓，巧妙呀！這單簡的畫面，象徵看整個都市的人生。</p>
<h3>站在學術崗位為祖國謀福利　潮僑學會昨日成立　選舉林天鐸王猷建蔡楚生等為執委</h3>
<p>（本報專訪）潮籍僑胞在香港，是擁有二十多萬的一個大數目。在南北行街（文咸西街）一帶，簡直就是潮州話最盛行的地域。他們以刻苦而豪爽的性格苦心經營，在商業與經濟方面早已握有相當重要的權柄，負有深長之歷史。在文化敎育界方面之貢献亦素著成績，惟缺乏組織，，力量仍未得集中。旅港潮藉文化人最近爲「聯絡感情，研究學術，共謀祖國桑梓福利」起見，特發起組織潮僑學會、籌備經已就緒，特於昨天下午一時假英京酒店舉行成立大會，出席者有旅港潮藉文化人三十餘人，濟濟一堂，極一時之盛，首由主席王猷建宣佈開會理由，旋報吿籌備經過及通過章程。再次，選舉，茶語，攝影，至四時許始盡興而散，查選舉結果中選爲執行委員者計：王猷建，林天鐸，蔡楚生陳昌蔚，羅吟圃，張家彥等七人。候補委員計：張敦德，陸浮，林子實，蔡漢蓀，王永載等四人。最後各執委互選結果，推林天錚爲主席。蔡楚生，羅吟圃，陳昌蔚任研究部。王猷建，張家彥，王永載任總務部。該會規定凡橋居杳港之潮州同鄉對于學術具有研究熱誠者，不分性別，年齡、職業，凡願意站在學術崗位，共同奮鬥，而熱心祖國桑梓謀福利者，皆得爲該會之會員，該會成立後，將經常舉行各種學術研究及各項健身訓練。一俟基礎奠定之後，擬注重多方面之聯絡，策動僑居各地同鄉組織分會，俾集中力量向着同一目標進展云。</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>衣在香港</h3>
<p>— 郁珢</p>
<p>『香港是沒有窮人的。』你也許聽過「老香港」這般說吧（？）這句話的發出，是說市民階級的香港人，很要撑場面，縱然不吃也好，都要打扮得漂亮，來適應『先敬羅衣，後敬人」的都巿環境。</p>
<p>迢句話看來楚對的，尤其是在過去幾天——廢曆新年裏幾天——我們看吧，擠　在馬路兩旁的男人，女人。和孩子，　個都打扮得十分堂皇，不是西裝便是長衫馬褂，花碌碌的旗袍。毛葺葺的皮大衣，五光十色，應有盡有，中中西西，各式俱備。從行路人們底衣服看去，香港眞是沒有窮人。</p>
<p>在家裏，男人儘管是運動背心，『牛頭褲』（短褲），木展，女人儘　是睡衣，短褲，或內衣，短褲，紅木屐，可是一出街外，男人都西裝筆挺，革履光亮，女人那旗袍，高踉鞋，花枝招展</p>
<p>香港人對於氣候的感覺或許是特別敏銳吧（？）許多人都知道：香港人穿衣服是「未冷先冷，未熱先熱」的九月十月裏，寒暑表僅僅降到六十度，香港人們便穿上絨四裝，大衣，棉袍，皮袍，有的男人史穿上有着毛領的飛機師皮大衣，女人們穿上虎皮，豹皮，灰鼠皮大衣，好像「愛斯基摩」人一樣。他（她）們把香港　得像北極似的了！</p>
<p>温度同是寒暑表六十度，可是，在三四月裏，却又大大不同了，女人們都光着大腿，光着手臂，通氣的「海虎絲，』透明的「蟬翼紗』，把她們底脊背隱約地現來出。男人們也要穿綢，紡，白沙魚皮，蔴萬一類夏季衣服，他（她）們的「北極」的香港現在却看作，火奴魯奴，爪畦，或馬來亞了，</p>
<p>香港人對於服裝的新花樣的追求很努力，倫敦，巴黎的新裝，很快在這裏出現，原因是很多人去看電影是從電影學習新裝的，譬如令天×戲院放影的影片裏，丹尼朶嬪的大衣是沒有紐的，明天便有很多香港小姐學他穿上沒有紐的大衣，今天放影的影片裏，羅拔梯拿穿的西裝，後背是暨有很多接的，明大便有很多香港少爺學他穿很多接兒的西裝。</p>
<p>對於香港人穿的漂亮，講究的衣服，很多外方人土或外國人都會有這樣一個疑問：每月受薪二三十塊錢的人，怎樣能够打扮得這樣華貴漂亮呢？讓我吿訴你一點，小市民先生們是有着他們撐塲面的好辦法的，譬如做西裝。三十多塊錢一套西裝他們斷不會把整個月的薪水換一套，以後勒緊肚皮不吃飯：份們有所謂「西裝義會」，辦法是十個八個「志同道合」的朋友，大家組織一份五元或十元的義會，一切和普通義會一樣不過會友『標會』之後所得現欵祇用之「做西裝」吧，</p>
<p>有些投機的洋服店，有分　淸繳的辦法，便利顧客，三十塊錢一套衣服，造了之後，可以分六個月或四個月清繳，近來也有做　居的「月餅會」，臘味店的「燒臘會」的辦法，舉辦「西裝會」的，這種「西裝會」　每月每份繳供若干元，在是年的夏冬兩季，每次任你選擇他們指定的西裝一套，……種種辦法無非利便收入少的人們，使他們不必一次拿出大筆現欵。</p>
<p>如果更「經濟」的話，又有故衣店一條路可走，上環大馬路和油麻地上海街一帶，都有很多故衣店，這種商店賣的有當了過期不　，由當舖批發給他們　的『原當故衣』也有成衣店裏，客人定下，過期不取的『新退衣』。今年聽說因爲×人侵略，內地巿場喪失，新衣故衣積滯香港，所以價錢特別平，一套完全新的西裝，六七塊錢便可以買一套，舊的二三塊錢便可以買一套，男子大衣，五六塊錢可以買一件，最華　的也不過十多塊錢，女子大衣更平，三五槐錢一件的很不錯，有着皮領，樣子很新式的也不過十塊錢左右吧，今年可說是小市民穿衣的機會。</p>
<p>外國俗語說：「衣服做成一個紳士」。都市人的眼光是很勢利的，我們的衣服常常首先遭人打量，倘若衣服太隨便，便會遭多數的勢利的人白眼。這樣，我們對于小市民先生們穿衣服，撑場面，也很難怪，問題是在整個社會呢。</p>

<h3>怎樣批評戲劇</h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>戲劇批評是戲劇活動本身中的一種檢討工作，也是一般社會的文藝批評以戲劇活動爲對象的一種努力。戲劇是最原始的人類精神活動之一，在傳說的叙述與描繪，在宗敎儀節之舞踊中，已經開始了戲劇的史頁。從古代到現在，世界各民族都不能例外地，戲劇是人類精神食糧之主要的供給者，是情感活動之有力的影響者與重要的組織。</p>
<p>同時，戲劇批評也是與戲劇活動具有同樣悠久的歷史。</p>
<p>戲劇和其他的藝術部門不同，他是綜合的藝術，他是身體的藝術，他是動作的的藝術，他是鬥爭的藝術，戲劇的活動有賴於多數人的合作和羣衆的欣賞，所以他是最大衆的藝術。他的形象的媒介，最容易而又最深刻地影饗他的對象，所以他是最社會的藝術。</p>
<p>正因爲這些，戲劇批評特別是一種必要。</p>
<p>戲劇批評和其他部門的文藝批評，有着質的不同。他不是個人對一件靜的藝術品的賞鑒，而是以社會的一員的觀點對動的羣的藝術活動，做一個正確認識與理解，做一個嚴正的檢討與批判。</p>
<p>這才是戲劇批評正確的出發點：用社會的進步的觀點，人生的地享受，了解，攝取人生之模仿（同時是創造）的爲術，看出他在行進中的人羣之意義：也就是戲劇批評的特質。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>有什麽樣的戲劇，便有什麽樣的戲劇批評，這和說「有什麽社會便有什麼戲劇」一樣是眞實的。古典戲劇當做詞餘文學創作，那時的批評也只看他一吟風弄月』的技巧。其後戲劇逐漸發展成爲娛樂，成爲商品，戲劇批評也成了一種商品作用——捧角宣傳，或是商戰工具——攻擊漫罵，珠罰異之。到了戲劇成為社會　爭的武器的時候，戲劇批評，也成爲百分之百政治的說敎，偏於思想鬥爭的一個角度，直到求解放的偉大戰鬥開始，戲劇成爲動員民衆的發動櫗的時候，戲劇批評才開始走上服從抗戰，服務抗戰的大路。</p>
<p>爲便利起見，我們可以說中國的戲劇批評經過上述的幾個階段。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>怎樣批評戲劇呢？</p>
<p>首先，我們可以說，一個批評家好似一個普通觀者一樣，他把一齣戲從頭到尾看下去，看出一個有頭有尾的故事，他的情感不自知地跟着故事的發展而起了波動。他直覺地接受這形象動態的繼續。這是採集批評素材的一個步驟。（這等於創作　第二個階段，可是這理是一致的，所以說『批評就是創作』。）</p>
<p>其次，從一個故事當中，我們自然會感覺到有一個Moral（是非之見），一個Idea（思想），一個thame（宗旨，主張）。對於這個Moral起了理智的反應，無論是贊成或反對其全體或一部，這已經進到批判的境界了。</p>
<p>第三，我們會想到在一個整個的大題目之下，他各部分的配合怎麼樣，發展的綫路怎麼樣，結搆的方法怎麽樣，一切技術的條件，都引起了我們的考慮了。如果說第二階段是綜合的，那這一個階段便是分柝的了。</p>
<p>第四，我們會進一步想到，這樣的一個劇本，這樣的一個演出，在許多的演出中他們佔有怎麽樣的位置呢？在整個戲劇運動進展上，他會有什麽作用呢？對於整個社會，他會有什麽影響呢？這功利的考慮，可以說是社會的階段。。</p>
<p>經過直覺的，渾合的，分析的，社會（評價）的四個階段，批評者對他批評活動的對象算是有了確定的把握。</p>
<p>這是寫戲劇批評普通必經的徑路。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>一個戲劇批評家，怎麽才能通過這樣的四個階段而獲得正確的效果呢？那就要靠自己的修養—一般的和戲劇的。</p>
<p>修養的問題也就是一個戲劇批評者所必須具備的條件。</p>
<p>首先，一個戲劇批評者，必須具有正確的世界觀。因爲戲劇所反映的，所紀錄的，所推動的，所組織的，是人類進行着的社會生活。那生活是多樣的，繁複的，矛盾的。假如他沒有學過正確的，進步的思想方法與基礎的社會知識，那麼他的批評是機械的，而且常常是錯誤的。</p>
<p>是但這不是說，有了一般的智識他就可以登上批評家的寶座了，如果根據一個方式或者僅是一般的常識是不可以了解或帮助創造偉大的作品的，所以：</p>
<p>其次，他必須對各部門的智識非常地熟練，戲劇的詳細條目和工作進程，都是一個批評家必備的武器。</p>
<p>單是局限於戲劇的技術的熟練，還是不够的。</p>
<p>第三，他必須對一般文藝的法則，對其他各部門的特質，都要有廣泛的修養，這樣他的精神更可以博大，了解更容易深入。</p>
<p>最後，一個批評家必須是工作的實行者，運動的參加者，他才能有當作一個運動之有機的一環來讀一個劇本，來看一次演出。所以，要在工作的吸收與揚棄中，發揚批評機能，建立進步的，建設的、創造的，能動的戲劇批評。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>我們不能停留在「文人相輕」和「和互相標榜』的階段，我們不能當做「舅舅團」（捧角家們）的批評家協會，我們用不着講空洞的政治理論。所以，要寫好的戲劇批評，我們的批評家要不斷地學習與參加實際工作！</p>
<p>劇運通知</p>
<h3>孤島劇運一周年</h3>
<p>— 緯藍</p>
<p>一。從年頭說起</p>
<p>上海成了孤島，大部的戲劇工作者都要開了到內地去，中國劇運正當向上走的時候，又遭受到這重大的打擊，而孤島的劇運也就更加『孤」了。</p>
<p>不過，從一九三八年說起，在年頭起却可喜地有着一個蓬勃的現象，「靑烏劇社」首先演出了『雷雨」，「日出」，『女子公寓」，『大雷雨」和「衣錦榮歸」；往下就有「曉風劇團」演出了「洪水」，和上海藝術劇社的「女子公寓」和「梅羅香」；但蓬勃的現象僅有一時，接着又消沉下去了。</p>
<p>二。「靑烏」的解散</p>
<p>到「上海劇藝社」</p>
<p>『靑烏劇社』是個具有相當規模的團體，可惜，於幾次大公演之後，內部發生了意見，結果鬧成解散了。一部份社員組織「曉風劇團」，並拉攏了幾個電影明星如已逝世的尙冠武等；另一部份社員組織了「上海藝術劇院」，主持的是李健吾，顧仲彝兩人，曉風劇社爲了被人發現經費來源有某種嫌疑，結果給大英晚報首先揭發，因而不久壽終正寢了。「上藝」成立不久，干積極參加上海各界救濟難民公演當中，收到恐嚇信，但後、來仍努力上演了，可是不久又因人事上及環境上而迫得和「中法聯誼會」合作起來，于中法聯誼會戲劇組主辦的名義下，變成了『上海劇藝社』，于法工務局立了案，鞏固了底基，現她可算是孤島上唯一的大劇團了。牠擁有優秀的演員和枝術人材，第一流的導演如吳仞之，許幸之，李健吾等，第一流劇作家尤兢，顧仲彝等都是該社會的贊助者。演員如藍蘭，夏霞，舒適，周起，徐立，夏風，吳湄等都是基本演員，每次演出都貢献了最高的表演。</p>
<p>「上藝劇社」的首次公演是于一九三八年九月廿三，廿四，廿五三天，在法工部局禮堂演出，劇目是法國巴若原著鄭延毅譯的「人之初」，由顧仲彝改編，吳仞之導演，前後共演兩次，頗得好評；第二次演出羅曼羅蘭原著，李健吾譯的「愛與死的搏網」，許幸之導演，同時還演出了美國奧尼爾的新型獨幕劇「早點前」，李健吾導演，于十月廿七至卅日連演四天，十一月五六兩天又重演，成績很美滿，新型獨幕劇而又是獨脚戲的「早點前」的演出很成功，有很好的評價。三，「星期小戲場」</p>
<p>到「戲劇交誼社」</p>
<p>孤島雖然形成了，然而　一般沒有離開上海的戲劇工作者的基礎份子却很多，他們在自己的範圍裏組織了許多小型劇圍，他們雖「小」而志向却大，趨向也好，組織份子多爲大中學生和一般業餘的愛好戲劇者，店員，銀行錢業的職員和海關的關員，收容所的職員難民和工人等；「星期小劇場」聯合了他們，領導他們，扶助他們。但星小的計劃，並沒有完全做到，祗是形式上聯合了各小團，而實際各團體間仍缺乏聯合的精神。</p>
<p>不久的過去『星小』會經停頓，最近經過了改組，成爲現在的『上海戲劇交誼社』仍繼續『星小』的任務，組織較前健全，工作也開展得好，參加『交誼社』小劇團約有十餘廿個，他們的演出都是受其帮助，尤以舞台技術方面，參加的劇團，如有演出，須詳細報吿其演出計劃于『交誼社』互相間有很好的聯絡。因是小劇團的行動受了正確的理論批判和指導，『交誼社』的主持也是各小劇團的幹部，雖然沒有名氣，然而都很能幹，對工作是忠實而努力的。</p>
<p>四，文明戲的新變態</p>
<p>影星顧夢鶴與白虹爲了生活的問題，從話劇走進『皇后劇院』企圖改良文明劇，可是他們用的是以話劇的方式來改良，結果得不到成效，弄得自己還吃了虧而失敗了。</p>
<p>現在，他們實行進新新公司的「綠寶劇場」演文明戲去了；幸好，『綠實劇場」的文明戲在他們努力改良之下是在走向路上的去，最少，佈景和燈光，在技術上已有了顯著的進步。</p>
<p>五、小劇團的活躍</p>
<p>在上海的劇團太多了，爲了數量多，而大家都很賣力，以至常有小演出；不過，仍多以參加遊藝性質的多，單獨漂出時每感人材和性質方面的缺乏。</p>
<p>十一月份除了「上海劇藝社」兩次大演出之外，『銀錢劇團』還作了一次大公演。</p>
<p>小劇團的銀錢劇團是郵政儲金匯業局與各銀行，錢莊的職員中愛好戲劇者的組織，他們在大公演之前曾于十一月晚在「寧波同鄉會」禮堂作練習公演，劇目是「白茶』『張冠李戴』等，成績平平，十一月廿三廿四兩天在麗都戲院公演「日出」，由夏風導演。成績却頗佳。</p>
<p>不久的過去，有「私立上海中學」的「歸雁劇社」和「省立上海中學」的「龍門劇社」于「交誼社」的協助下，在「工部局北區小學」舉行交誼演出，劇目是雁歸的「忍受」和「鎖着的箱子」，由努力于各小劇團間的胡導導演，同時「龍門」的自己集體導演的『冬天』和徐立導演的「求婚」，這次演出，給人一个好的印象，『忍受』，『鎖着的箱子』和『求婚』都有很精彩的演出。</p>
<p>十二月也許可以說是一九三八年度孤島劇運最蓬勃的時候，好像跟年頭那蓬勃的現象相呼應。</p>
<p>上海基督敎學生團體聯合會于十二月十七十八兩天在法工部局禮堂上演歐陽予倩改編慾魔的『黑暗勢力』，由蓋蘭女士導演，這個公演的性質是慈善籌款的，券價自一元起，但狠賣座是且上演成績也很好呢。</p>
<p>治中女中于十九日趁慶祝校慶，假座表演外國歌舞的蘭心戲院舉行「救濟難民遊藝大會」，節目除了音樂等之外上海劇藝社參加演出『女子公寓』日夜兩塲，日場並由徐立導演獨幕劇「藝術家』夜塲由張中楹導演英語六語劇，「絕代艷姝」由該校同學担任演出。</p>
<p>六「中法劇藝學校」</p>
<p>與「戲劇服務社」</p>
<p>小劇團不但缺乏演員和導演，就是劇本，技術人材和演出地點都難于解决，爲了彌補這種缺憾，『中法聯誼會戲劇組』與「戲曲研究社』及一般中法愛好戲藝人士，合辦了一個中法劇藝學校，來培植一般戲劇人才。</p>
<p>中法戲劇學校的進行計劃分爲三期，第一期，先辦話劇研究速成科一班，崑曲研究速成科一班，理論與實驗並重，一年畢業，第二期，添辦深造科若干班。兩年畢業，第三期，自建校舍，圖書舘，劇塲等，計劃是這樣的使人可喜，但是不知能否實現。尤兢，許幸之，吳仞之等都是該校敎授，校長是馮執中，話劇崑曲兩班招生結果，共有二三十人入學，已於十月一日開課。</p>
<p>劇運動態</p>
<h3>救亡演劇第二隊將出國宣傳—日內可抵港</h3>
<p>上海話劇界救亡協會，戰時移動演劇第二隊（簡稱救亡演劇第二隊），自去年八月間離滬，歷經蘇州，南京，徐州，開封，鄭州，洛陽，漢口，以及大別山脉內的商城，麻城等縣；再沿粵漢路南下，轉湘入桂，一路以演劇唱詠宣傳去敎育民衆動員民衆，得着很好的成績，在上海出發時僅十四人，領隊的是前進的電影明星金山先生和王塋女士，沿途曾吸引不少優秀的同志。因爲工作的努力，生活的嚴肅，到處得到軍政當局和社會人士的讚許和歡迎。最近，他們正逗留在桂林，繼續作着抗戰藝術的宣傳，曾公演「台兒莊之戰」等國防名劇，很博得一般人的好評。現在，他們爲要把救亡宣傳擴展刻海外去，同時替前線將士向僑胞呼籲，特决定最近向南洋一帶去演劇，行期預定六個月。據接該隊同志航信，謂已于本月十日左右由桂動程來港，在港將作短期逗留，預算在這數日內當可抵步了！</p>
<p>香港劇聯公演</p>
<p>抗戰以來，本港救亡劇運頓形蓬勃，小規模劇團更如雨後春筍。去年十二月因爲環境的需求，他們便組織起一個港九靑年戲劇協會，參加的小劇團達二十餘個之多。現在，香港方面又有一些靑年話劇團體，組織一個香港話劇聯合會，自經發起舉辦後，報名加入者，已有雲友劇社，少年團，學賑　西段劇團，丁丑劇社，弄弓社，與華中學劇團等團體現在他們已定于今日（廿六日）下午七時假座加路連山孔聖堂作首次聯台公演，除話劇外團，得少年合唱更書學賑會中段幹訓班，華義學院等，担任歌詠合唱，想屆時定有一番熱鬧呢！</p>

<h3>南華兩軍齊出　弟弟喪師兄告捷　東方以四比二破南華華　南華南凈勝香港會六球</h3>
<p>昨日下午香港會球塲、連續有兩幕甲組聯賽、（一）東方對南華華、（二）南華南對香港會、看客不因春季大賽馬而少減、大抵因祗付費一次、部可看連檯好、價廉味高、球迷認爲相宜、故趨之者多歟、</p>
<p>東方克南華華</p>
<p>東方人齊　南無則否</p>
<p>第一幕球事開戰時、東方陣容仍　、惟南華華未以全力應戰、譚均幹、楊水益踪跡渺然、攻守方面均覺軟弱、焉能抵禦軍心振奮之東方、惟開始接觸之際、東方有輕×意、與時又好盤弄、雖攻勢盛旺、總不能破扉人室、及至被南華華偶然反攻、東方卽吿失守、以零比一先敗、此時始覺得對方之不易侮、立刻糾正錯誤、卒于失守後五分鐘、迫成平手、以一比一完上半時、下半時十分　、南華華再以二比一佔先、此球之失、全因顯漢抱球不穩、脫手而出、逐爲根保衝人、苟顯　鎭靜不怯、無論如何、此球不　入網、</p>
<p>事後論功　澄滔第一</p>
<p>查全場表演最作者當推澄滔，其抄襲之犀利、傳球之準綱、每令人繋節稱賞、東方之能轉敗爲勝、此君快馬運輸之功也、李德祺雖能連中三元、但遲疑失機、牽累軍心不少、南華華能以如斯陣勢、兩度佔先，實前鋒線努力以赴之鐵證、惟守衛力、似覺大不如前、門前險象環生、常處于被動地位，朱兆恆危　孤守、救駕乏人、雖左撲右拍、無濟于事也、</p>
<p>【東方隊】</p>
<p>劉顯漢</p>
<p>苗華國　會仲雲</p>

<p>謝錦洪　林德譜　劉偉培</p>
<p>譚振輝　區士諤　陳德輝　楊根保　葉潤波</p>
<p>根保一挑　先開紀錄</p>
<p>開賽後、混戰至十五分鐘、南華華打出重圍、猛烈反攻、潤波邊境傳中、德輝一頂、根保一挑、球遂入綱（一比〇）南華先勝、（十八分鐘）東方發奮圖强、下令總攻、圍至南華門前水洩不通、祺祥在要地施射、爲劉茂戲蹄所撐所澄滔雖搶得皮球、但爲柏偉飛奔　阻、無濟于事、廿分鐘）始讀中路奪　、遠送李四、祺祥得李四之快傳、卽行叩闊、兆恒撲救不及、球遂入網、（一比一）、</p>
<p>南華守弱　連失三關</p>
<p>下半時十（分鐘）、振輝盤球　追、斜吊球門、顯漠離城接球不科于慌忙中、脫頴而出、根保　前一，　人帶馬，踢球入網、二比二、南華冉度估先、（十二分鐘）　聖中路突繋、　球澄滔、澄滔過關斬將、開弓而射、中柱彈出、德祺及時趕至、冉加一脚、兆恒欲救無從、做成二比二之平手、（廿二分鐘　澄滔再施側擊、單騎飛襲、傳一妙球、德祺迎球一頂、中往彈出、德祺反身再鈎，竟吿成功、成三比二之局、卅三分鐘、澄滔重施故技、偉培柏偉先後失守、德祺又乘其妙傳之便、演其雙飛脚、射球入網、四比二、至完埸來方得勝、</p>
<p>南南勝香港會</p>
<p>强弱懸殊　絕無精彩</p>
<p>東方與南華華之戰完畢、南華南與香港會　起交鋒、你來我社、無甚精彩、初時香港會尙能抵象、頗見强橫、　經數十囘合後、則漸露破綻、最後則更潰不成軍、到鳴金收軍時、南南饗「大樓客」以六　光蛋、做成南南在第二週聯賽勝球之新紀錄、考昨日之戰、因一强一弱，致成一面倒、故絕無精彩可言、南南所　大勝者、由于陣綫完整、將士用命、榮才守關、演出異常鎭靜、對方所射之妙球、均被一一拾去、直可稱守門聖手、內衛二將、前衛三傑、防守堅固、無隙可乘、故對方無法越雷池一步、前鋒五員、活躍如生龍活虎、不動則已、動則有如晚　、至香港會之敗、其顯著處、則爲守衛之軟弱、守鬥與二衛、形同虛設、前衛又技不如人、尤以美靈頓爲最無能、無法阻南華之進攻、前鋒亦聯絡散漫、射門又乏衛、左翼伶芝、尙有可取而已</p>

<p>榮才救球　博得好評</p>
<p>時　、由香港會開球、斗文截得、沿邊直上、抵要地叩關、高路斯接去、旋馮李　　並進、有若二龍出海、李先後兩度射門、前者過高、後者被接、香　會大難不死，會竭力反攻、洛之向門發射、凖且有力、榮才鎭定、雙手一動、出球于險、球迷莫不拍掌叫絕、鏖戰約十六分鐘、兆榮截得寶貝、兩衛出阻均被越、　再單刀盤球闖進，不數步、卽舉足向門射去、高路斯撰一個空、球乃溜進網內、中央再開、恩　旋又截得來球、斜交廣森，從邊偷襲、急如星火、及美靈頓追至、廣森已進至腹地、高路斯見廣森射門、遂躍起撲救、不料又撲空，逐負零比二、後香港會亦拚命反攻、洛之先後數次衝進問鼎、奈南南固守若金湯、祗迫得一角球、後榮才犯規、　被射十二碼球、不料其安又斜射出界、無何，上半場吿終、</p>
<p>華南勢盛　予取予携</p>
<p>休息、南南之士氣益盛、予取予携、佔盡上風，厮殺移時、兆榮得榮照傳球之便、順水推船、瞬卽進至要地、高路斯臨危出走、兆榮乃寫意地將之打進網內、再過六分鐘、南南前鋒又若排山倒海衝至、其安與史杜蘭治、見情勢過危、乃狠狽出截、不料恩楔機警過人、閃閃避避、最後一踼入網、此後景祥施一百步穿楊之妙技、竟中紅心、恩樑隨亦效之、果又中的、未幾終塲、南南大勝六此零鳴、獨力難支、雖欲不敗、安可得乎、</p>

<p>（本報特訊）蘇軍士葛對米杜息、第一週以一比一戰和、斯際雙方節將猶存、形成勢均力敵、故賽來竟至難分難解、昨爲第二週、兩隊在掃桿埔場作重逢、惟形勢經已大變、米隊之健將屈臣哥羅根等已離隊歸國、而蘇軍之波洛都等亦作烏倦知還、戰力同時削弱、猶幸米軍不乏後起、承繼得人、實力雖略受影響、仍無傷大體、但蘇軍則因好手不齊、後繼者難承大業、實力虛浮，每况愈下、昨日出戰米軍、如小巫之見大巫、祗有招架之功、而無還攻之力、局勢成一面倒、結果米隊不費吹灰之力、以五比一之成績大勝士葛、</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……法宮艷后</p>
<p>Marie　Antofnette</p>
<p>本片、在任何方面、都足稱爲偉大成功的作品、片中每一個場面、都充滿着動人的羅憂斯、和緊張恐怖的悲劇情調、同時瑙瑪希拉和泰倫鮑華在此初度合作中悲更能把法國尾永一個皇后、慘的命運、唯妙唯肖的表現出來、他們兩人在片中的演技、已是達到表現藝術的最高峯、</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉在片中飾一滿懷着熱情與希望的奧國公主、不幸嫁給了生性癡呆的路易十六，她失望之餘、遂縱情於奢華淫逸的生活中、幷愛上了化臣公爵、但終於因浪費國帑、自滿情慾、不得人民的諒解、和路易的庸碌無能、弄至民不聊生、革命爆發、而在此時代的變亂中、造就了她極悲慘的命運、</p>
<p>片中把這一段動人的歷史事跡、活活如生的般上銀幕、佈景與服裝方面、也皆極盡偉麗堂皇的能事、同時本片對於皇后奢侈淫逸的生活、和造就她那種性格的環境、與及當時法國革命的情形、皆有極迫眞的描繪、更增加本片的真實化、此部「法宮艷后」是一部極値得介紹給觀衆的作品、</p>

<p>故事似乎過於冗長一點、但是它叙述了三四十年的美國航空業的經過、自發軔以迄今日，以三個終身從事航空的靑年爲主、演來頗足動人弗萊麥克茂莢、雷米蘭兩位男主角　稱職、女主角是位新人、魯　絲甘蓓爾、由本片看來、她是個很有希望的新星、</p>

<h3>待思的思索</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>不久之前有人問我曾否研究哲學，意思是勸吿我研究一點哲學。爲了不放鬆一个得一點知識的機會，就冒昧提出了哲學究竟是思索抑或是信仰的問題，這問題也許是不哲學的，但爲了新進者的方　起見吧，囘答是先定下了信仰再思索。那末思索的結果是懷疑怎樣呢？這就須對　疑再來一个懷疑。也許竟沒有再懷疑呢？回答「也許」有的，而目應該有的，再問下去是正足證明自己的不可敎了。這樣就終結了我的哲學最初一課。</p>
<p>沒有勇氣再學第二課第三課，因爲如果每課的結果都證明自已不可敎就將發覺一切自已知道的東西，都失去依傍，似不如姑安於無哲學的生活。我羨慕開始就以宗敎式的信心，取得自己的哲學的根據的人，他們系統地選擇所需要的，和捨棄所不需要的知識。但被捨棄的太多，似也是很普通的現象，自然這不是哲學本身所會造成的結果，可以也不能不懷疑從哲學出發　更多地引起這現象。</p>
<p>企劃敎育的再解放，是目前的一種頗可樂觀的新努力，其成功也將是大時代的一個不小的收穫專家的意見還不曾有多少發表，學生却已經很多在報誌上表示其希望了，最普通的一種意見是非難中學課程不切實際，需要其取捨之間，多少是根據理想的，這看法連一些前進的編者殊有誤會，所以答問的信函，都力說基本學科的重要，但重要與不重要，純然抽象地討論，是很可以正反兩方面都極有理自的。譬如說地理課所包括的知識，大都是　參考之用的，這諭點確頗有價値，可是發這機議論的人，未必不容我們懷疑他是否能在參攷書上，找到所需要的地理知識，甚至他是否知道突尼斯是在非洲或在歐洲。</p>
<p>側重於單個事件的記憶誠然是現在中等敎育的缺點。可是具有抽象性質的算學，又普遍最不爲多數學生所喜，一部份的原因，自然還是因數學也被敎學者弄成種重記憶不重思索的學科，可是這情形的造成，多少也由於學者不高興在這方面應用思索。從前呢，頗有人以爲中學生不能思索是應該的，使學生注意算學法是建設起實科有甩　這一信仰，而在這信仰下算學是人門的根基，現在，從思索出發，知道要建設這種信仰，實不免于偏見，而算學似乎也因爲這偏見守門，要連帶被拋棄，算學是哲學思索的基本工具這一點，倒是很需重提起的</p>
<p>算學對于現代哲學的完成，曾盡了很大的貢献，但新起劍橋派的新唯心論，也就是由數學出發，太注重于算學的思索方面，得到這　種結果，自然很可能。如果哲學的性質是思索，則這也應是哲學的範園所容許。而且我們這否會有把算學作學科學的工具引作哲學的基礎這樣長距離的跳躍，似也無須預先懸想。若僅略微向思索多跨一步，倒正是需要。哲學上的思索容許達怎樣的程度，是暫時無需問及的。</p>
<h3>多數的宏壯美</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>「旅途隨感之三」</p>
<p>在永州一帶的猺山中，看見好些峯巒，從脚到頂，都滿長着蒼綠的杉樹。它們密密地擠着，彷彿皆要爬上山巓，伸着千萬個頭，爭向着太陽，搶吸着大氣似的。這光景使人感到了多數的凑合，數目越多，就越發顯出了宏壯的無比的美。</p>
<p>同樣，在桂林的一個山洞前看見洞下面廣塲上，排列起整千的學生軍，吼着救亡的歌曲。那雄大的一派聲浪，簡直把原野和天空，都像震　動了，也令人感到了無比的宏壯的美。覺出人類團結起來，一致動作的偉力，實是非常驚人的。同是一樣的歌，一個人唱的時候，只覺那是歌而已，反之，整千的喉嚨，齊聲唱出的時候，却深切感到這簡直是搖撼人的力量。</p>
<p>先前中國人單獨到海外去尋生活，只顯出了奮鬥和耐苦的精神，這回在×人進攻之下，大衆團結起來一致反抗侵略者，我相信，必定會給世界人士，一種另外的驚人觀感的。卽使覺不出這是無比的宏壯的美，也應該再不會感到我們中國人老是一盤散沙！　二月十六日桂林</p>

<h3>抗戰文藝的新任務</h3>
<p>— 何偉初</p>
<p>文藝是站在時代前驅而啓示光明的時代路向的，並不是跟着時代跑的東西。中國未掀起偉大的反侵略戰爭烽火之前，在中國文藝的一般主題上，早已活生生地暴露出侵略者的兇焰，並啓示中國要求生存的出路，就須與侵略者作一番熱烈的偉大的鬥爭！而今中國也的的確確跑向了神聖而偉大的抗戰之途了，換言之，這也可以說是文藝界已盡了一部分的責任了。，來搏取寶貴的代價——生存的出路。而且，這是歷史賦與我們這一時代所要完成的任務，站在時代前驅的文藝的啟示，亦同是這樣。</p>
<p>由是，可知在抗戰現時代的文藝，已不是少數文人和文化人自賞的東西，而是變成了大衆指南，和被壓迫民衆們的號角。，和戰場上流熱血拼頭頗的英勇事蹟，和流離失所的難民的悲號，同時還須注意後方帮助抗戰而流汗的勞苦大衆之努力奮鬥効能的反映，以及掛抗戰招牌而圖私勢力的鞏固，與爲了私益私利而誤害民族前途的反映，也極其重要和必要，但是，不特要盡反映的責任，同時要盡指示鬥爭的政治路綫，和眞理的曙光。</p>
<p>就這樣，還不能够完盡了在抗戰現時代的眞實的新任務，對於顯示英抗戰的榮耀，偉大，和號召廣大民衆對侵略者難忍的憤怨，而激勵與喚醒廣大民衆到神聖的戰塲去，組織和敎育廣大民族統一戰線的圈子內，發揮抗×的偉大力量。</p>
<p>總之，在現時代抗戰中文藝的新任務，不僅要反映黑暗的一面，同時要顯示光明的一面，而文藝寫作的形式，却不妨採用多種方式的表現。</p>
<h3>鎗決</h3>
<p>— 殊倫</p>
<p>距離山麓幾十丈遠的地方就有衛兵把守着，監押着漢奸的一個小隊伍，依然向前挺進，前行的吹起單調的喇叭，一種簡單得非常低沉的悲切的昔響是在說明一個不必再生存下去的人底最後訣別之前的心的動盪。</p>
<p>從四會縣城中山路一直追趕出來的人，到距離刑場很遠很遠的地方就站着，好像隔着一條河似的對望過去，這時候，有些人是巴不得戴上一副精微的望遠鏡，使得對方的一切都好看個明白淸楚，有些就全不顧慮到這一些了，他們泄氣似的咒罵着：</p>
<p>『用香烟燒他就好了，槍斃還是便宜了他』。</p>
<p>『五馬分屍才是最好不過的呢！對付那些漢奸』。</p>
<p>同惰這一種論調的人可眞不少，他們很容易的就會互相交換着這種同一的意見，甚罕用提出一種最慘酷的刑罰的方法來驕傲別人，取勝別人！</p>
<p>所以，他們的心里都這樣說：</p>
<p>『要是我們是一個立法者和執法者就會便當得多了』。</p>
<p>但是，另一些人却是帶着胆怯的心來看奇的，他們平生第一次的參與這一種殺人的盛典，由於對漢奸激　的憎恨，就越益增加他們的那種好奇心和勇氣了。</p>
<p>那個胆小的漢奸在衆人底眼光下越加畏怯起來，他彷彿是一個不認識行路的人，第一步落在地下之後不能再把脚步提高起來了，他的脚底有種東西把他固牢地膠着，而現在他是希望眞有這麼一種東西，使他能够不再行動就好了。</p>
<p>然而，這是不能够的，那個有組織的隊伍已經很迅速地前進了，兩個强有力的兵士把他死命地　向前去，一大班看戲似的羣衆又以一種過於嘈雜的聲昔助勢着。</p>
<p>終於，到了一個適中的地點，那個監押就把他放鬆地停留下來，隊伍里頭的一個士兵趨前幾步左右去做巡　，跟着一切都好像佈置好了，漢奸就脆弱得如像小孩子似的一推就滾倒在地下，他的頭好像要求向上或向下一時都不能决定，他的手和心自然是震顫得非常厲害，靠近一點的人相信就可以看見而且知道他連最低小的希望也不敢做了。</p>
<p>『砰！』這一聲給與許多以適度的快意，就認爲他們來到這里的希望已經相當滿足了。</p>
<p>因爲漢奸經已不支地橫倒下去，人們遠更深一步渴望着第二槍響。</p>
<p>『砰！砰！』人羣中沒有起過任何的騷動，最多也不過互相通知一下，或者替死者的傷口記下一個數目：</p>
<p>『第三，第三槍了！』</p>
<p>大槪死者已經絲毫不能動地躺倒了，人們對于這個垂死者也達到滿足的境地了。</p>
<p>一個軍官模樣的，他一手就把屍身反轉背來，作爲記號似的高高地提起他的駁壳，然後又低低地打發出去，於是，最後一槍是從罪犯的肩背穿射進去。</p>
<p>漢奸像一塊泥土似的埋下地上，監押的小隊伍片刻鬆懈一下，站崗守衛的也歸到隊伍中來，於是，看槍决的人又一窩蜂地越過山道，甚至越過前面行走得慢慢的人，兩步併爲一步的飛上前去。</p>
<p>槍决了的漢奸躺直着，手一條麻繩用緊緊的反縛着，血口創開着，紅的，紫的，淤黑的，像一朶殘敗了的玫瑰流在他的胸瞠上，腰上，屑背上。</p>
<p>跟一刻之前一樣，有些人是感到通量的快意，另一些人却得脆弱的思潮湧動者，看他們帶着憐憫的神色，似乎是在想念着：</p>
<p>『我幷不替死者可惜，可是他爲什麽要這樣的死呢？』</p>
<p>人漸漸散了，粗重的鐐鎖依然不動地素置在漢奸的兩脚上。</p>

<h3>Lasting Resistance Will Surely Achieve Final Victory</h3>
<p>— Feng Yuxiang</p>
<p>The heroic resistance of the past nineteen and a half months proves more than anything else that as long as we intensify our efforts and persevere in our resistance, we will surely achieve final victory. Since the start of the war, the [Japanese] have been deteriorating day by day, while we have been progressing day by day. Looking at the current facts is enough to prove this point.</p>
<p>What the [Japanese] used to boast about was their "brave" imperial army, but today's imperial army is afraid of fighting, afraid of the Chinese army, afraid of the guerrillas, and even afraid of the Chinese people. Their "bravery" is only expressed in their anti-war actions. On January 22nd, more than 3,000 [Japanese] soldiers rioted in Dagukou over anti-war sentiments. More than 500 [Japanese] soldiers in Jiangyin also mutinied at the beginning of this month, killing the [Japanese] commander. A unit of the Japanese army in Hankou was preparing to riot, but the plan was leaked, and 150 military police and soldiers were arrested. Japanese soldiers in Shanghai organized a Youth Party and distributed leaflets in Hongkou advocating the Three Principles of the People. Five [Japanese] officers and soldiers in Taiyuan committed suicide outside the East Gate due to "extreme war-weariness"! Japanese naval senior advisor Vice Admiral Yamasaka composed a poem in Xiamen expressing his war-weariness and longing for home. In Japan, a large number of officials in the Ministry of the Army joined the anti-war association, and more than a thousand students at the Imperial University went on strike against the war. Meiji University, Waseda University, and other schools were searched by military police on the 8th of this month, leading to a literary inquisition. These facts are not accidental. These anti-war waves will turn into a torrent with our stronger resistance, destroying the [Japanese] warlords' war of aggression.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, unemployment, hunger, a military expenditure of one hundred million yuan, public debt of two hundred million yuan, and the nationwide floods are all things that every Chinese person knows, so we will not talk about them. Just look at what the Italian Weissbrod said in his book "How I Became a Japanese Spy," based on what he saw with his own eyes. He said that the Japanese warlords are using kidnapping, smuggling, opening opium dens, opening brothels, opening gambling dens, and manufacturing and selling drugs to raise their military expenses. Their plight, baseness, and pitiful situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>The [Japanese]'s international environment is facing increasing difficulties due to its insane actions. On the 10th of this month, [Japan] took advantage of the strained relations between France and Italy to attack Hainan Island. We ourselves are "already prepared for all land deployments and will do our best to fight the [Japanese] army on the island." Even friendly countries such as France and Britain are questioning them sternly on the one hand and preparing for practical actions on the other. In terms of international relations, the Japanese warlords originally wanted to take this opportunity to strengthen their unity with Germany and Italy and threaten France and Britain to make concessions, but the result only made their "being at war with the world" situation more obvious.</p>
<p>With our sustained resistance, Japan's war capabilities are weakening day by day, and its difficulties are increasing day by day. The people and the army are increasingly aware that the war is harmful to them and are rising up against the war. However, the Japanese warlords are using more insane attacks to try to solve these difficulties. The result naturally strengthens these difficulties and makes them approach total collapse faster.</p>
<p>On our side, it is the opposite. Strategic and tactical approaches are rapidly progressing. The moving, admirable, brave, arduous, diligent, and striving facts of senior officers to every soldier are endless and cannot be fully written. In terms of the masses, from large entrepreneurs to farmers in the countryside, from the elderly to elementary school students, many have taken out their strength and money to contribute to the resistance. In terms of politics, from Xinjiang to Guangdong, from guerrilla areas to our rear areas, there is gradual reform and improvement. In terms of economy, the occupied areas have stopped the [Japanese] from plundering our resources, new modern industries are being established in the rear cities, and the vast rural agriculture and handicrafts are being organized in the form of cooperatives. In terms of international relations, it has progressed from the sympathy of the people of various countries to the actual assistance of the governments to us. These advances are being accelerated and guided by our supreme commander in a planned manner, moving towards the goal of final victory.</p>
<p>However, our progress is still not enough compared to the needs of the war. We must intensify our efforts to completely stop the [Japanese]'s offensive and fully prepare for our counteroffensive. Our efforts should follow the four directions listed below:</p>
<p>First, we must intensify our unity. Today, during the period of resistance, there is a very simple truth: what the [Japanese] hope for must be harmful to us; what the [Japanese] oppose must be beneficial to us. Konoe's "quick peace and quick conclusion" conspiracy is what the [Japanese] hope for and is harmful to us. Therefore, those who echo Konoe are tools of the [Japanese] and criminals of the nation and the state, and therefore have been severely sanctioned by the central government. On the other hand, what the [Japanese] oppose and want to destroy is the sincere unity of our entire nation, so we must help and love each other more, support the National Government and the Supreme Commander, and strictly prevent the [Japanese] from sowing discord through their tools.</p>
<p>Second, we must contribute more effort and more money. Since the start of the war, compatriots have been helping the army, bravely serving in the military, enthusiastically donating, and subsidizing the country. This is a good phenomenon, but it is still far from enough. We still need to intensify our efforts, using one minute as ten minutes, one person putting in the effort of ten people, to engage in various resistance work. Those who used to spend ten yuan now only spend one yuan, those who used to use ten things now only use one. As much as possible, contribute money and goods to the country and concentrate them on resisting the war. It would be even better if overseas Chinese also donate more.</p>
<p>Third, we must pay attention to anti-[Japanese] propaganda. The Supreme Commander said: "Propaganda is more important than combat." We must, in accordance with this meaning, explain the purpose of the war of resistance and the methods of effort to every compatriot who is not concerned about or not concerned enough about the war of resistance. Overseas Chinese should, on the one hand, publicize our government's policy of sustained resistance, and on the other hand, ignite the patriotic hearts of all overseas Chinese, so that everyone, directly and indirectly, becomes a tool for "expelling the Japanese."</p>
<p>Finally, we must develop wealth and consolidate our economic foundation for the war of resistance. The government already has plans to develop the southwest and northwest. I hope that compatriots will actively work hard under this plan, and overseas Chinese will invest more enthusiastically so that this plan can be realized more quickly.</p>
<p>"Knowing is the ability to act." In the past nineteen and a half months of the war of resistance, compatriots have known that "Resistance will surely win, and nation-building will surely succeed." They will surely be able to persevere, become more vigorous, and promote the earlier arrival of final victory.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Today</h3>
<p>— Lu Yi</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Returning from the Guangdong war zone, we deeply feel that after the painful lesson of the "Fall of Guangzhou," there has been a leap forward in Guangdong's political, military, and general mass mobilization work! Even though these advances are only the beginning and are still far from enough, we can continue to move forward in this direction based on the foundation of these advances, and we may be able to get through the "stalemate" stage and reach the victorious "counter-offensive."</p>
<p>First of all, let us look at the political aspect. The reason why Guangzhou fell so quickly in the past was certainly due to military mistakes, but a large part was also due to political reasons. The biggest problem in politics was the lack of coordination within the Guangdong Party, military, and government, and the lack of unity. This caused many unnecessary frictions and estrangements, forming many gaps. Since the new Chairman General Li Hanshun took charge, the gap between the provincial government and the army has been eliminated. Moreover, on the positive side, efforts have been made to coordinate politics with the military, actively improve the wartime administrative structure, establish four provincial government administrative offices throughout the province, and vigorously implement innovative administration that meets the current needs of the war of resistance. At the same time, the provincial government held large-scale training classes to intensify the training of a large number of young cadres as the central backbone for implementing wartime administration.</p>
<p>Secondly, let us look at the military aspect. Due to the lesson of the fall of Guangzhou, the Guangdong military authorities have deeply felt the urgency of the army's political work. Therefore, the political department of the Fourth War Zone is currently holding training classes for political workers, preparing to train a large number of cadres to enrich and expand the army's existing political work organization. Their aim is to have a political instructor in every company in the army, and in the future, even to have a political instructor in every platoon and squad, so as to ensure that political work can be thoroughly and universally implemented in the troops. There have also been new changes in strategy and tactics, basically focusing on mobile warfare, supplemented by guerrilla warfare in cooperation with the army and the self-defense groups, and necessary positional warfare. Due to General Zhang Xianghua's return to Guangdong to preside over military affairs, the unity between the various Guangdong troops has been consolidated and the unity of military command has been strengthened. Finally, it must be particularly pointed out that our recent victory in the counterattack against Zengcheng and the capture of Huiyang and Boluo, the most important thing is that the military authorities are good at mobilizing the masses' armed forces, combining the army's armed forces with the masses' armed forces, and practicing the unity of the army and the people in combat. Only then did they achieve brilliant victories!</p>
<p>Again, speaking of mass mobilization, under the call of defending South China and defending their homes, the self-defense groups in various places bravely fought against the [Japanese], fully demonstrating the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Guangdong people. Some self-defense groups followed the army to advance to the rear of the [Japanese] and develop extensive guerrilla warfare. Some guarded day and night, taking on the task of eliminating traitors in their hometowns. Some filled the gaps in the defense of the regular army, so that our army could go out to attack the [Japanese] without any worries about the rear. Due to the dispatch of many young work teams by the Mobilization Committee to various villages in the interior, surrounding the self-defense groups, and organizing anti-[Japanese] self-defense associations in various villages and towns, so that future mass mobilization is not just a temporary work, but has become a regular work centered on the self-defense groups. Mass movement work can be carried out from organized masses or more advanced sections to disorganized or more backward levels to achieve true national mobilization. Here, the authorities still need to effectively cultivate mass movement cadres, correct narrow mobilization methods, so that the vast power of the masses, especially in Guangdong, where the foundation of armed forces of the masses is the strongest, can be further developed, and accelerate the completion of the objective conditions for the counter-offensive in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Today, the war situation in South China, on the surface, presents a state of dark clouds and no rain, but this does not mean that the [Japanese] have abandoned their attempt to attack our southwest. On the contrary, the [Japanese], holding on to the semi-arc-shaped front line near Guangzhou, are currently waiting for an opportunity to attack. On the one hand, they are trying to "pacify" the guerrilla warfare in the rear and consolidate their occupation. On the other hand, they are gradually reinforcing and preparing to attack again to cut off our southwest international transportation line. Recently, the [Japanese] army has increased its troops in South China by four divisions. The concentration of [Japanese] warships in the coastal areas of Guangdong and Guangxi is a sign that the [Japanese] army is about to attack South China.</p>
<p>Based on the existing progress, we must accelerate the progress in political and military aspects, mobilize the vast and unparalleled power of the masses to smash the [Japanese]'s attack on South China. This is the central task of the current situation! (Special contract from the National Salvation Society)</p>
<h3>Industrial Cooperation in Our Country's Economic Mobilization [Continued from yesterday]</h3>
<p>— Shou Miancheng</p>
<p>7.  The granting of loans for industrial cooperation should be quite cautious. The Association's offices are far away in various places. If each loan must be approved by the General Association, it is impossible. Even if you want to ask the district office one by one, it is slightly slow. However, industrial cooperation loans often amount to thousands or even tens of thousands. The price of raw materials is rising every day, and we have to save them in advance in order to meet the principles of economic management. Then the need for funds is self-evident. However, if such a large amount of loans, and most of them are used for fixed capital, cannot be recovered in a short time, if they are not used cautiously, it will not only be difficult to avoid the emergence of malpractices, but also the funds will feel insufficient day by day. In order to remedy the situation; I think that first, the personnel in charge of loans in various places should go through guarantee procedures, and the staff working in the same place should guarantee each other for mutual supervision. Second, the loan authority of district offices and offices should be restricted separately, and if it exceeds a certain limit, it should go through verification procedures. Third, the General Association should appoint audit commissioners to be stationed in district offices and offices on a regular basis, so that loans cannot be decided by one person alone. Fourth, the borrower should receive it directly from the capital custodian institution or personnel to clear the procedures. Although responsible personnel in various places can be completely trusted if they can choose carefully, the system must be strict. In fact, if there is any relaxation, the originally scheduled procedures can be reduced or exempted as appropriate. This is the seventh point.</p>
<p>8.  The business of industrial cooperation must be able to take into account the special circumstances of wartime and the changes that will inevitably occur after the war. Industrial cooperation cannot but make a contribution to the war, so the manufacture of wartime supplies; is also within its scope of work. During wartime, the government encourages wheeling in order to maintain foreign exchange, so all processing and manufacturing related to wheeling in; industrial cooperation should also be done as far as it is capable. During wartime, the government must also find ways to encourage the production of domestic goods to replace imports in order to maintain foreign exchange. This is also where industrial cooperation can be effective. During wartime, due to the implementation of the conscription law, there is a gradual lack of agricultural and industrial labor, so female labor should be used as much as possible to prevent production from stagnating, and to train women in the functions of life. However, the needs of wartime may disappear after the war. During wartime, prices rise. Although the production cost is high, it can still be maintained with difficulty, but after the war, prices fall, or it will not be easy to support. Moreover, after the war, various large industries return to normal and expand production. Cooperative factories will face great rivals. At that time, how cooperative factories can continue to develop should also be considered in advance. Therefore, the business of cooperative factories at this time should be such that it can continue to produce after the war, or switch to other products, and suitable items should be selected so that the market needs after the war; can still maintain its existence and development. This is also very important for the location of the factory. On the one hand, it must avoid bombing and strive for safety, and on the other hand, it should still strive for convenient transportation and simple transportation. At the same time, this factory should pay attention to the purity of the organizational components, and it should not organize workers from all parties in a mixed way, so as to avoid shaking the foundation of the cooperative due to the return of workers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang after the war. It should also use the high prices during wartime. Raise more public accumulation funds to make the capital strong and prepare for competition after the war. This is the eighth point.</p>
<p>9.  Industrial cooperation should find ways to promote other cooperative undertakings, such as transportation and sales cooperation and consumer cooperation, to facilitate the purchase of raw materials and the promotion of products. Before such cooperation can be established, the association should set up supply and transportation agencies to solve the supply and transportation problems of various cooperative societies. This is not only for the development of industrial cooperation itself, but also to gradually complete the business outline of the cooperative movement. I have already described the links that industrial cooperation and general cooperative administration should have in the previous section, and I believe in its importance even more when I see this. In fact, industrial cooperation should not only achieve close cooperation with other cooperations, but also with other related construction work. This is the ninth point.</p>
<p>10. Industrial cooperation should strive to cultivate its autonomy ability, so that it does not always rely on the government's coercion. This is the fundamental principle of cooperative undertakings, and it is not only true for industrial cooperation. However, if you can pay attention to it at the time of establishment, the results in the future will definitely be better. In addition, the joint organization of industrial cooperatives is also very important. However, the joint organization should not be forced. If the societies are far apart and the content is not very substantial, and they do not have much understanding of cooperation, at the same time. There is no connection in business at all, only because they are both industrial cooperatives and they are united. Then it must be of no effect at all. If the organization of this joint society can be planned in advance, several unit cooperative societies can be established in a planned way in nearby areas, and it is planned to establish a cooperative society in a certain place. I would like to think that the future development of industrial cooperation will all depend on whether it can use the strengths of small-scale management to remove its shortcomings. The function of the above-mentioned joint organization is to remove its shortcomings. This is the tenth point.</p>
<p>The above ten points are a brief description of what should be paid attention to in promoting industrial cooperation in our country as far as I can see. If we can pay attention to it in time, it may be of some help to the healthy development of this emerging industry. However, the Association authorities may have already considered it, and the correct understanding and enthusiastic support of industrial cooperation from other parties is especially indispensable. If we can get the cooperation and promotion of central and local technical agencies, cooperative authorities in various provinces and counties, and local authorities, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. This is also the slight meaning of my drafting this article.</p>

<h3>Shanghai [Japanese] Pressure on Concessions, Our Country Should Value This Highly, Iron Nets and Sandbags Arranged in Central Concession Area, Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] The authorities attach great importance to the Shanghai incident. They believe that the unreasonable demands made by the [Japanese] to the Shanghai Municipal Council are a further step in putting pressure on Britain and the United States and expelling the last remaining rights and interests of the two countries in the Far East. Britain and the United States already know the [Japanese]'s intentions and will not concede. In order to achieve its goal, the [Japanese] dare not take military action, but believe that they will definitely find ways to disrupt the security of the concessions. In order to deal with it, Britain and the United States will also retaliate actively, so the development of the situation will become increasingly serious.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 25th] The Municipal Council has recently installed barbed wire and sandbag obstacles along the intersections and alleys of Nanjing Road and blocked them in order to conduct searches at any time and prevent terrorist attacks.</p>

Armed merchant corps Russian team members and patrolmen conduct strict searches, because it is believed that many terrorists come from Pudong. In addition to large patrols of police officers patrolling the streets, British troops are also on guard in their respective defense zones.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] According to foreign news from Shanghai, the Continental New Daily, run by the Japanese, said in an editorial this morning that assassination cases have repeatedly occurred in the Shanghai concession. The Japanese should immediately start a forceful "sweep" of the concession without wasting time and empty talk through diplomatic means.</p>
<h3>Tianjin [Japanese] Blockade, American Military Defense Zone, Obstacles Set Outside the Boundary</h3>

<h3>Government Allocates Funds to Develop Yunnan's Mineral Resources; Yunnan Northern Mining Company to Open Next Month; Capital of Two Million Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Air Dispatch] Yunnan Province, located on the frontier, possesses abundant resources. The provincial authorities, recognizing this, have long been meticulously planning and striving to develop them. Recently, they have welcomed investment from foreign individuals and organizations to consolidate the economic foundation for the war of resistance and national construction. Last year, the provincial government and the Resources Commission agreed that each would contribute two million yuan in national currency, and would take over the originally well-managed Dongchuan Mining Company to establish a large-scale Yunnan Northern Mining Company Limited, jointly developing Yunnan's rich resources. Temporarily focusing on northern Yunnan, they will establish a headquarters and offices in Kunming. Initially, they will focus on the main production areas of copper and zinc, such as Luoxue, Yinmin, and Maolu in Dongchuan, setting up mine factories, and offices in Huize, Yongbei, and Yimen counties. The purpose, in addition to the mission of state-run enterprises and promoting national production, is to improve the technical skills of Yunnan laborers, prevent them from perpetually suffering from exploitative practices, and guide small-capital miners in various locations to adopt new production methods to consolidate the economic foundation during the war of resistance and national construction. The company has ordered a large number of new-style equipment from Europe, and some of it has already arrived in Yunnan. The first steps to be taken are: first, to exploit resources; second, to explore mineral deposits; and third, to purchase metals from private businesses. It also plans to establish offices in major domestic and foreign cities for operational convenience. In the future, if development proves effective, the existing capital of two million yuan will be increased several times to vigorously develop the resources of the entire province. This is the first step towards realizing the development of Yunnan's resources after the war of resistance. The significance of its mission can be imagined. The company held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month in the Finance Department, immediately establishing a board of directors and supervisors, respectfully inviting Chairman Long to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Hu Yitong, Lu Chongren, Yang Gongzhao, Miao Jiaming, Yun Zhen, Sun Zheng, Zhang Peiguang, and Sun Zhizeng were appointed as directors. Yuan Piji and Zhang Zhilin were appointed as supervisors. A joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors was held that day, and the company's articles of association were approved. In addition to setting up offices and mine factories in concentrated development areas, the internal organization includes a general manager, an associate manager, and several engineers, with four departments: General Affairs, Engineering, Business, and Accounting. It was decided that Lu Chongren and Sun Zheng would be the managing directors, Hu Yitong would be the general manager, Zou Shijun would be the associate manager, Zhang Zhilin would be the secretary of the board of directors, Xu Xiaoshan would be the company secretary and chief of the General Affairs Department, Cai Ruofang would be the mechanical engineer and chief of the Engineering Department, Liu Jingmin would be the director of the Kunming office and chief of the Business Department, and Chen Yingjing would be the chief of the Accounting Department. It has been decided to open for business on March 1st, and preparations for taking over the Dongchuan Mining Company have been actively underway in recent days.</p>

<h3>Strange Phenomenon in Shanghai: Armed Funeral, Chen Lu Not at Peace Even in Death</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 25th] The funeral of Chen Lu, the former foreign minister of the puppet "Nanjing Reformed Government," who was assassinated and died on the 19th of this month, took place here yesterday in a very peculiar manner. Police officers from the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the puppet "Great Way Municipal Government" under Japanese control, as well as British and Japanese troops, were all mobilized to prevent disturbances. Chen's body was carried in a hearse, traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour, crossing the concessions. Relatives and friends followed in cars, escorted by concession police in the two concessions, and by Great Way puppet police and Japanese troops outside the concessions, to reach the public cemetery in western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Wreckage Found Near Lanzhou; All Eight Aircraft Were Made in Italy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] According to authoritative sources, in the air battle over Lanzhou on the 20th of this month, our air force displayed great prowess and shot down nine aircraft. Six of them were found in the vicinity of Lanzhou, and the remaining three were discovered in Jingyu County. It was determined that the aircraft shot down were Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s, twin-engine aircraft capable of carrying seven people and 1,250 kilograms of bombs, with one fixed machine gun in the front and two movable machine guns in the rear. Furthermore, one aircraft shot down in Luoyang last month on the 24th of the previous month resulted in the capture of their captain, Eiji Sugita, and the recovery of his bombing orders, which detailed the bombing targets as: first, military barracks; and second, city street houses. This shows that the Japanese deliberately bombed undefended cities and innocent civilians, which provides strong evidence of this.</p>
<h3>President Kong Presented the Political Report for March at the National参政会; Progress in Both Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] President Kong presented a political report at the third session of the National参政会, the original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since the adjournment of the second meeting of your esteemed assembly, much has evolved in the international situation during these past three months, and there has also been considerable progress in all domestic administration. This is, of course, what everyone is extremely concerned about. The heads of the various responsible agencies will all come to the meeting to report on the details. I will now give only a general review and briefly explain the policy guidelines for the future for your reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the international situation, the first thing I want to explain is the evolution of the international situation towards us. Now, the governments and peoples of friendly nations have a clearer understanding of the purpose and spirit of our sacred war of resistance, and therefore, the sympathy and assistance they provide us is even more active. This is the most gratifying thing in the past three months. The 104th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council resolved to continue to provide us with moral support. In addition to the Soviet Union continuously providing us with much assistance in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Treaty and the resolutions of previous meetings, the United Kingdom and the United States have been particularly strong in their assistance to us. The United States has bought a lot of our silver in the past to help us maintain the legal currency policy, and recently, they and the United Kingdom have successively established commercial loans with our country. I believe that everyone will be as grateful to the friendly countries as the government is for this profound expression of friendship. I would like to solemnly tell everyone that the government is continuing to find ways to develop trade between China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, to eliminate all difficulties, and to further advance the economic and commercial relations between us and the friendly countries.</p>
<p>Since November 3 last year, when your esteemed assembly was in session, the Japanese government issued a statement. On December 19, Arita spoke to foreign reporters, and on December 22, Konoe gave a broadcast speech. Based on the previous statement, he put forward more specific conditions. The ambition and hideous face of the [Japanese] to conquer China and dominate East Asia have now been completely exposed. Our supreme leader gave a stern rebuttal at the memorial week of the Premier on December 26, stating our position. On December 31, the U.S. government continued the first note in October and sent a second protest note to the Japanese government. On January 14 and 19 this year, the British and French governments also sent protest notes to the Japanese government, taking the same steps as the United States. The U.S. protest note firmly upholds the effectiveness of the Nine-Power Treaty, expressing two important points: First, the United States formally declares that China's political independence, sovereignty, and integrity are inseparable from the open-door policy. No country in the world can maintain an open-door policy if it loses its independence and sovereignty. Those of us who study modern world history know that the U.S.'s consistent policy of maintaining security in the Pacific is based on the premise that China's independence and the open door policy complement each other. The United States re-declared this historically inevitable trend and the meaning of the Nine-Power Treaty to the world in simple and clear words, which has already had a great impact on world opinion. Second, the United States believes that existing treaties can be modified and adjusted through international consultations, but cannot allow unilateral abolition or destruction. The international status quo is not forever immutable, but to change the status quo, it must be done according to legal procedures. The notes of the British, American, and French are based entirely on justice, so in principle, we agree with them. Some people believe that the countries of the world can be divided into two factions: those who maintain the status quo and those who revise the status quo. This view is specious. In fact, the division in the international community is only between two propositions: to amend treaties through peaceful consultation, or to destroy treaties through military aggression. The difference between these two approaches is very great, because it is related to the future of human civilization and happiness. Our answer has already been announced to the world. We are willing to promote all peaceful consultations with the most sincere and reasonable attitude, but peaceful consultations are not without scope. Problems related to national survival and national independence must never be the object of negotiation. As for military aggression, we will resist it and we will resist it to the end.</p>
<p>The Japanese first used force to create a new situation, and then said that the existing treaties were not suitable. If this trend is not stopped, international credibility will not be established.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Member Pan Yunchao Dies from Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 25th] Central Committee Member Pan Yunchao was injured in a car accident on the 19th and was hospitalized. He eventually died of his injuries this morning at 5:00 AM. His last words were that no obituary should be issued after his death, and that cremation should be carried out, eliminating all unnecessary waste.</p>
<h3>Under Military Politics, the Japanese Live a Hard Life, Forced to Save and Raise War Funds, Reduced Clothing and Food, Unspeakable Suffering</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Tokyo News. In order to raise war funds, Japan is currently implementing two major principles of thrift: (1) eat less; (2) do not buy new clothes. The Japanese government relies on this to sell government bonds. Last year, Japanese national savings reached 5.3 billion yen, and the total amount of government bonds issued due to the China Incident was 3.6 billion yen. This year, the Japanese budget reached 10 billion yen, so the government is urging the people to practice thrift. The impact of inflation is already being felt in Japan, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. For example, a bundle of charcoal that used to cost only 80 sen has now risen to 1.90 yen. Rice prices have risen by 10 percent, and fish prices have risen by several percent. Ordinary people can no longer afford meat. Such high prices may seem insignificant in Britain and the United States, but for an average Japanese family with two children and a monthly income of only 50 yen, the impact is enormous. A certain magazine listed a budget for a family with a monthly income of 50 yen, in which food accounted for about 11 yen per month, i.e. 70 sen per day for a family of four, or 20 sen per person. Of these 20 sen, 10 sen goes to buying rice. Rice is expensive, and 10 sen per day is usually not enough. As for the types of food, soybeans, radishes, vegetables, soy sauce, and salted fish are included.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Party and Government Joint Meeting Resolved to Strengthen Grassroots Work</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 24th] Yunnan held its first joint meeting of the Party and government today, deciding to strengthen grassroots work. Including the current county party branches, it plans to promote party affairs in sixty counties, in order to integrate the people with the Party and government.</p>
<h3>Hengyang Cloaked in War Robes</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Hengyang is where the Xiang-Gui Railway and the Yue-Han Railway connect. It is also a hub of southwest transportation, and its strategic importance is self-evident. Although at this stage, Wuhan at the northern end of the Yue-Han Railway and Guangzhou at the southern end have unfortunately fallen into the hands of the enemy, like two ends of a lifeline being poisoned, its reserve force – the Xiang-Gui Railway – remains intact. Especially the Xiang-Qian Railway, which connects with the Yue-Han Railway at Zhuzhou north of Hengyang, will soon be open to traffic to Zhijiang on the border of Hunan. They are all arteries with vigorous blood flow, which can continuously transport countless white blood cells at any time to swallow the toxins in the two ends of the Yue-Han Railway and other lost areas, so as to remove corruption and promote tissue regeneration, and complete the great cause of resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>Hengyang is an important city, and it goes without saying that the enemy wants to "get it and be satisfied." Since gun and artillery power cannot reach it, they often use airplanes to wreak havoc. The most severe were the two consecutive nights of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the 15th and 16th of last year, when they came to Hengyang in batches to wreak havoc, dropping hundreds of bombs in the Beidou and Xiaoximen areas, burning dozens of civilian houses, and causing about four or five hundred civilian casualties. Our air force rose up to fight back and shot down five enemy planes one after another, two of which fell on the county, and the wreckage has been recovered. Although the two railway tracks and bridges were also bombed, the railway workers recognized the importance of transportation responsibilities and worked bravely day and night, always repairing them as soon as they were damaged. Although everyone knows that it will be bombed again after it is repaired, everyone would rather endure the hardship and repair it so that the train can pass that day. If it is bombed again tomorrow, it might as well be repaired again. This spirit of perseverance is admirable. The reporter moved from outside the city to inside the city. The rain had just cleared, and the road was still muddy. I heard two air raid sirens in a row, but the air defense equipment was quite good. Just follow the street signs and run to the air-raid shelter. At the same time, there were police and the Three People's Principles Youth Corps guiding the way, so the order was also very good. The service groups organized by the government and society here, such as the battlefield service members of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, the battlefield service teams of the political departments of the various military groups and divisions, the Hengyang All-Circles Anti-Japanese Committee sub-groups undertaking condolences and providing tea and water, as well as the wounded soldier reception centers set up by railway employees or Christian churches, are truly like bamboo shoots after a rain, too numerous to mention. The Hengyang Anti-Japanese Committee held public performances of new and old dramas to raise money for wounded soldiers' quilts, using the ticket sales income to purchase them. The participating theater troupes included the 8th Anti-Japanese Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the 1st Traveling Drama Education Team of the Ministry of Education, the 2nd Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe, the 1st Film Projection Team of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the 2nd Hunan Opera Troupe, the Changsha Children's Drama Troupe, the Changsha Mobile Theater Troupe III, and the Hengyang July 7th Theater Troupe, etc., more than ten groups in total. They all worked hard, one after another, and brought out their best plays. They performed for ten consecutive days, and almost every day was wonderful, and every day was sold out. However, the ticket price was set low (a high price might not be easy to sell), and the total income for ten days was only two thousand and hundreds of yuan, plus donations of only more than four thousand yuan, which could eventually make more than five hundred quilts; but it is really difficult. They have all risked their lives on the front line for the country and the nation, and now they come down with honorable injuries, and they still have to suffer from the cold in the icy and snowy weather. If our compatriots in the rear—especially in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Nanyang—who can still live a warm life do not continue to donate generously to save these experienced soldiers and allow them to recover as soon as possible and return to the front line to eliminate the enemy, how can we feel at ease!</p>
<p>This urban area of Hengyang, which straddles both sides of the Xiang River, is like a woman wearing a fashionable war robe. Anyone who passes in front of her must salute her. However, there are exceptions. The reporter did not salute her, but regarded her as a female warrior team equipped in a position neither too far forward nor too far back, and inspected her once in a "parade" manner. I think her moving lineup can be described as follows:</p>
<p>First, let's start with the outline of her head—the city: The urban area covers an area of about sixteen square li, the city circumference is more than seven li, and there are seven city gates. The south gate is called Huiyan; the southeast gate is called Yuejiang, commonly known as Tielumen; the east gate is called Yingri, commonly known as Chaibudou; the northeast gate is called Xiaoxiang; the west gate is called Anxi, commonly known as Daximen; the northwest gate is called Wanghu, commonly known as Xiaoximen; the north gate is called Zhanyue (Yue is Hengshan), all of which are elegant and meaningful. There are 100 and some odd pillboxes around the city, and there are more than 300 in the whole county. In addition, there are tens of thousands of tightly organized self-defense teams in various townships and towns, all eager to try and looking forward to the arrival of the battle to shed some blood and sweat for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>The reporter entered the city through Daximen. There were two soldiers holding guns horizontally, guarding and watching, with a very heroic demeanor. There was also a traffic policeman holding a red flag, directing the entry and exit of cars. Nearby, there were also solid air-raid shelters for passers-by to avoid air raids. After entering the city and walking straight, it was not long before I arrived at the post office. At that time, the three places for selling tickets and sending registered express letters were all crowded with people. According to Mr. , the person in charge of the 'Information Desk', this was originally a second-class bureau, but the recent postal service has exceeded that of a first-class bureau. The staff has also doubled compared to before, but in fact, it is still not enough to cope with it.</p>
<p>Soon to the main street crossing, there are two standard restaurants facing each other, one called "Hao Gongdao". It is said that it moved from Shanghai, and for every meal, two corners and five cents, you can eat "quite full" of meat, vegetables, and rice. It is so civilianized, which is not bad. But the Fujian restaurant across the street, which advertises "all female service," and the sign is written in red and green, is a bit "out of time." The restaurant has three floors. The middle and lower floors sell set meals, five corners and five cents a meal. If you eat a la carte, the price is also more expensive. The third floor specializes in a la carte, and the price is extremely high. It is impossible to eat rice without spending three or four dollars, but what you eat is not delicious food, but just having a female waiter to accompany you to drink. According to a waiter on the second floor, angrily said: "The male waiter's monthly salary is only ten yuan, the head chef's is eighteen yuan, and the rent is only thirty-six yuan, but the female waiter's salary is as high as seventy yuan, which is too unfair!" He looked up at the entrance of the third floor and continued: "If you don't tease her, she teases you—just for more tips. At the same time, there are many civil servants who like this set. At this time, it is too much to spend money like dirt!" This is not entirely out of jealousy, but it is very reasonable. In addition, there are two or three large-scale restaurants and hotels that advertise with female waiters. Even if the government is inconvenient to passively prohibit them from operating, it should actively levy national salvation donations from them. The slogan of "improving the lives of soldiers" that has been chanted for a long time, if everyone thinks it is very valuable, but it is just that the funds are limited and difficult to implement; then we might as well adopt the method of praising the few and benefiting the many, and first reduce the special expenses or office expenses of senior military and political personnel, and use them as one source of funds to improve the lives of soldiers. At the same time, this is still two "radical" methods to curb waste by senior civil servants!</p>
<p>Walking to the crossroads, I took "asking for directions" as an excuse to climb the police's guard station and look around: The east road slopes down, and the Xiang River is outside Yuejiangmen; the street is full of rice loads, and each yuan can buy 18 to 20 kilograms of white rice. The north-south main street, also known as the main road, the shops and stores are all western-style buildings of four or five stories high. Banks, bookstores, cloth shops, silk shops, department stores, etc., are mostly arranged side by side on this street. In the middle of the road, there are cars and horses like dragons, and people are bustling on both sides. Its prosperity and liveliness can be compared with the second and third-class roads in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Indeed, the population of Hengyang is very developed. According to the Ministry of Interior's survey in the 18th year of the Republic of China, there are more than 1,366,000 people in the entire county, and the urban population accounts for 150,000. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan were successively lost and the fire in Changsha, according to Mr. Liu Xingyi, the secretary of the county government, the urban area has now surged to 300,000 people. The government pays five silver dollars a day to the strong men who help the army transport goods. Whether it is hundreds or thousands, they can be recruited as needed and arrive as soon as they are called. There are also more than 500 people who regularly serve the army every day. This seems to be a greater contribution of manpower than any other county. If the population is not dense, it would certainly be difficult to do. However, although the population of Hengyang is so dense, as soon as an air raid siren is heard, everyone can hide without a trace in an instant.</p>
<p>Going north from the main street and turning east to "Yingri Gate", take a boat across the "Jiangdong Shore". The Xiang River is as blue as the Gui River, but the water volume, depth, and riverbed are several times larger than the Gui River. At the docks on both sides, wooden signs are inserted, stating that each boat carries ten people and charges two cents per person. There are also many civilian houses on the east bank of the river, mostly living along the river. Along the river, I turned south again and came to a road connecting the city to the Yue-Han Railway Station. There were also many noodle shops and hotels, mostly opened by people from Beiping and Henan. At this end of the road leading to the city, there is a large sandy beach under the bank. Some people are singing "Suzhou Ballads", showing "Magic Lanterns", and setting up various games and small gambling activities, attracting many wounded soldiers in gray cotton robes with red crosses sewn on them, to hang out and linger there. This seems to be a natural club for wounded soldiers, but what they enjoy is meaningless. Regarding this, I can only appeal to the propaganda teams gathered in the city.</p>
<p>From here, across the river into the city, there is a pontoon bridge made of seventy or eighty civilian boats, which can be freely passed without charge. The civilian boats are sealed by the government and given a daily living allowance per person; if there are military transport ships going up and down the river, they can be opened to let them pass.</p>
<p>At that time, a train had just transported a batch of wounded soldiers from the front line across the bridge to the shore to wait for assembly. Some of the clothes and quilts they were wearing were really broken and tattered, but they were still clutching warm coppers and stretching out their shivering hands to spend five cents to buy a newspaper from a news vendor. They had just shed blood for the country and the nation, and now they were enduring hunger and cold to buy a newspaper to read. This enthusiasm for caring about the war situation and national affairs moved me to tears at that time!</p>
<p>When I was about to walk to the south gate, I saw that the battlefield service group of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs had set up a wounded soldier reception center, where a pot of porridge was cooked, probably to be given to this group of wounded soldiers. At the same time, the stretcher team of the Hengyang People's Anti-Japanese Committee was also dispatched in full force and rushed across the river. It can be seen that there must still be some seriously wounded soldiers who could not move at the station!</p>
<p>In short, this woman of the times who has already put on war robes—Hengyang—although her local voice, color, and actions are not yet entirely like the "preparing for war" demeanor that a true warrior should have, after all, she is arming herself. It is hoped that those who are engaged in political work will actively equip her again, especially paying attention to the evacuation of the old and weak population in the urban area and the propaganda and organization of the people in the countryside, so that she can immediately progress and become a truly awe-inspiring and murderous combat soldier!</p>

<h3>Franco Government: England and France to Recognize Immediately; French House Passes Vote of Confidence; Spanish President to Resign and Leave France</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Burgos, 25th Dispatch] According to sources within the Franco government, after the formal recognition of the Franco government by Western powers, France will implement planned efforts to enable its industry and commerce to regain their former position in the Spanish market. It is expected that the French munitions industry will propose negotiations with Spain to supply large quantities of iron sulfide. Political circles here believe that the Franco government will insist on retrieving Spanish Bank gold, artistic treasures, and military materials stored in France as a condition for restoring normal Franco-Spanish commercial relations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th Dispatch] French Prime Minister Daladier reported to the National Assembly this afternoon that the authorities will take concrete steps to formally recognize the Spanish government on the 27th of this month. At that time, a meeting of cabinet members will be convened to decide on this matter. In response to external comments, Daladier said, "The security of our third border has been declared. France has no less than six hundred kilometers of border with the Franco government. The reason why I advocate that the French government should maintain friendly relations with the true government of Spain is precisely for this reason. Today, the true government of Spain is the Franco government." After Daladier's speech, the House of Representatives immediately passed a vote of confidence by a vote of 323 to 261. Daladier concluded, "I firmly believe that France should not be isolated from Spanish affairs, just as it should not be isolated from any other part of the world. This is not a matter of partisan policy, but a matter of French security." At this time, the entire assembly applauded greatly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Reuters has learned from authoritative sources that if the French cabinet agrees to Daladier's recommendation to recognize Franco's policy, the British government will take similar action on the same day. It is expected that Chamberlain will announce this move to the House of Commons at the same time as Daladier. London believes that France's decision indicates that negotiations between France and Franco have come to an end, and believes that the situation in Spain has been settled and that the government army's resistance will not continue. The whereabouts of Spanish Prime Minister Negrín are currently unknown. It is widely believed that he is still near Valencia and will soon leave the country. According to information obtained here, almost only Negrín in the Spanish government advocates continuing the resistance. The conditions for recognizing the Franco government are still unknown to all parties. The exchange of views between the French representative Bérard and the British representative Hodgson should gradually clarify the situation. Franco has notified Hodgson of Mussolini's promise to withdraw Italian troops. Authoritative sources recalled that Franco had stated that he wanted Spanish troops to occupy Minorca completely, and Franco had repeatedly assured British representatives that after ruling Spain, he would not pursue anyone except criminals. They expressed satisfaction with this. It is widely believed that Franco's hope to maintain friendly relations between France and Spain is no less than that of France. Furthermore, after the end of the Spanish war, Franco must immediately carry out long-term construction and pacification of the region. Britain and France are better able to assist Franco than other countries, because the financial resources of other countries are not as good as those of Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, Spanish President Azaña will submit his resignation when Britain and France formally recognize the Franco government and leave French territory. It has just been learned that the Mexican government has notified General Miaja, the leader of the government army, that if he is not tolerated in Spanish territory, Mexico is willing to welcome him as a guest of honor.</p>
<p>Attlee's Speech Criticizes Chamberlain's Policies, Advocates Increasing Confidence in the Soviet Union and the United States</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Birmingham, 25th Dispatch] British Labour Party leader Attlee recently delivered a speech here criticizing Chamberlain, stating, "We only have two paths to choose from, namely surrender or war. Prime Minister Chamberlain should express greater confidence in the Soviet Union. The country abides by treaties and is a friend of peace. I hope the Prime Minister will increase confidence in the people of the United States and other places and not rely on the deceptive promises of those who specialize in breaking treaties. It is inappropriate for the Prime Minister to express trust in dictators. We have clearly recognized the Spanish rebel government, but this government is the one that killed our sailors, sank our ships, and bombed women and children. The Prime Minister talks about peace but encourages illegal actions everywhere, claims to believe in democracy but is friends with thugs."</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Burgos, 25th Dispatch] It was announced here last night that the number of people captured during the attack on Catalonia reached 110,235, of which 100,000 have been transported back to the Spanish mainland, and more than 8,000 wounded soldiers are still staying in Catalan hospitals. According to the Franco government's radio station, former Catalan Governor Gabolillo has been expelled from the party by the Masque Party headquarters. Reliable sources have also received news here that serious incidents have occurred in the city of Murcia under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government. It is reported that officials from the French consulate were detained, but the details are unknown. There are rumors that General Miaja, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Republican government army, is also related to the detention of French consular officials.</p>
<h3>Ciano Arrives in Warsaw Unexpectedly to Entice Participation in German-Italian Axis; Poland Resolves to Maintain Political Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 25th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife, Polish Ambassador Drohosz, and many others arrived in Warsaw at 12:18 this afternoon. Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Italian Ambassador Valentino welcomed them at the station. Polish veterans lined up in front of the station to salute. Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife will stay at the Belweder Palace. This afternoon, Ciano will pay tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Beck will host a banquet in the evening.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Warsaw, 24th Dispatch] According to sources here, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive here tomorrow to conduct diplomatic talks with the Polish government. A Polish government spokesman told an Associated Press reporter today that Poland's foreign policy has already been decided. It is willing to maintain friendly relations with the German-Italian axis, but Poland is unwilling to give up its independent and free sovereignty, so it is determined to resist the forces that entice it to participate in the axis. Poland is an important factor in determining the overall situation in the Middle East, so its foreign policy must be prudent. At present, Poland is willing to maintain friendly relations with all friendly countries, regardless of Germany, Italy, Britain, or France, without being partial. Otherwise, if it only attaches itself to one side, Poland will lose its importance in determining the European situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th Dispatch] Diplomatic circles here declare that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Warsaw this time to conduct talks with the Polish authorities may not be able to induce the country to join the Berlin-Rome axis. The country's non-participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact has already been confirmed without a doubt. Although it recently recognized the Spanish Nationalist Army government as legitimate, the government immediately declared that this was a de facto recognition, which is very different from the ideological preferences of Germany and Italy. Political circles here also say that Poland is determined to maintain political independence at any cost. The country also has close relations with Romania. Ciano's intention is to urge the country to sever diplomatic relations with Romania and give up its unwillingness to the situation in Southeastern Europe. In a nutshell, Ciano wants to win Poland over to join the German-Italian axis, using Germany's temporary non-advance eastward as bait. Poland's transfer of Germany's attention to temporarily prevent it from advancing eastward, although possible, the countries of the Balkan Entente (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece) are united and strong, and their total military strength is no less than seven million, which should not be underestimated. Although these countries maintain good relations with Germany and Italy on the surface, in fact, no country has 100% goodwill towards totalitarian countries. The same is true in Poland. From this, it can be seen that even if Germany and Italy act rashly, they may not succeed, and it is expected that they will not dare to take the risk. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the competent authorities here all believe that no matter how hard Ciano tries this time, the Polish government will still maintain a neutral attitude and refuse to take sides.</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Economic Conference to Be Held Next Month; Ashton Returns to London Yesterday to Report on Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 25th Dispatch] Ashton, Director of the Economic Department of the British Foreign Office, stayed in Berlin for a week to prepare for the Anglo-German economic conference. He also had a long conversation with General Göring, the person in charge of Germany's Four-Year Plan. Today, Ashton will return to London to report his impressions to the government and Minister of Commerce Stanley. During his stay in Germany, Ashton met with General Göring several times, as well as German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, German Minister of Economy and President of the German Bank Funk, Director of the German Bank Puhl, and many German industrial and economic experts. According to Washington's commentators, the Anglo-German economic conference will be held in Berlin next month. This news proves that the crisis of war in Europe is very small.</p>
<h3>Arab and Jewish Representatives to Not Talk Directly for Now; Indirect Talks to Resume Tomorrow; Britain to Propose Constitutional Issues</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Arab, Jewish, and British government representatives continued their meeting for half an hour today and decided that the Arab and Jewish sides will not adopt direct talks for the time being and will make a decision after the representatives of both sides report to the entire delegation. All parties are quite satisfied with this decision. The indirect talks mediated by the British government are scheduled to resume on the 27th. According to people from the conference, the purpose of the recent trilateral talks is to make it easier for the Arab and Jewish sides to understand each other, and not to urge both sides to get closer immediately. In order to facilitate the reports of the Arab and Jewish representatives to the entire delegation, the Anglo-Arab talks originally scheduled for Saturday this week have been postponed to next Monday morning, and the Anglo-Jewish talks have been changed to the afternoon of the same day. It is reported that the British government will propose positive proposals on constitutional issues, immigration, and land sales in this meeting. These proposals will only be in outline and not in detail, as a basis for continued discussion.</p>
<h3>Hungary Joins Anti-Comintern Pact; National Socialist Party Dissolved Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 24th Dispatch] Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky, on behalf of Hungary, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact today. After the signing ceremony, the Hungarian Foreign Minister said that Hungary's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact is due to Hungary's continued struggle against Bolshevism for the past twenty years and is also the result of Hungary's friendship with Germany, Italy, and Japan. Since 1919, Hungary has participated in the struggle against the Comintern's intervention in international affairs. This agreement is not intended to oppose any country, but is a self-defense tool to oppose foreign undue interference in the internal affairs of the signatory countries. The methods of action of the Comintern are emerging one after another and are very powerful because they belong to an international nature. Therefore, we want to prevent it, and countries must cooperate. Then the German Ambassador to Hungary replied, expressing welcome to Hungary's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, saying that this move proves the friendly relations between Hungary and other signatory countries. He also expressed satisfaction with Hungary's participation in the struggle against the disruptive work of the Comintern and its loyalty to its historical mission of maintaining order and peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, 25th Dispatch] Hungary's National Socialist Party has recently been dissolved by order. This happened at the same time that the Hungarian government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which is quite noteworthy. According to observers, Hungary's move is actually intended to reduce Germany's "adverse reactions." Hungary's move will not have a major impact on relations with Germany, because Hungary's National Socialist Party has no relationship with the German Socialist Party.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Political circles here were quite surprised after the news of the Hungarian government's dissolution of the National Socialist Party reached here. At the same time, Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Warsaw on official business, which is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Pope's Will Unsealed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 24th Dispatch] The will of Pope Pius XI was unsealed today. The contents briefly stated that all items received during his papacy should be transferred to his successor.

However, the total amount of the Pope's wealth is still unknown.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th] According to official announcements today, a German plane, while crossing the Mediterranean from Arras, suddenly crashed. The plane and all crew members were unable to survive. However, detailed circumstances are currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Soviet Pravda Praises the Great Red Army as a Fortress of World Peace: Neither Intimidates nor Is Intimidated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Moscow Dispatch: This month, on the 23rd, the Soviet people celebrated the 21st anniversary of the glorious Red Army and Red Navy. That evening, Soviet public organizations and representatives of various Red Army units jointly held grand celebrations in Moscow, Kyiv, Boli, Vladivostok, Kunish Gan Kharkov, and other cities. All Soviet newspapers published numerous articles discussing the history and heroic past of the Red Army. The Pravda editorial "Ever-Victorious Red Army" stated, "Twenty-one years ago, various foreign imperialists attempted to take advantage of the weakness of the newly established Soviet Republic's army, but a strong domestic revolutionary movement arose to counter the enemies' foolish attempts. Thus, our glorious Red Army, created by Lenin and Stalin during the war, grew stronger year by year as its national defense capabilities became increasingly consolidated. The Red Army celebrates its 21st birthday with first-class military strength. The Red Army is famous for its many heroic victories and is deeply loved by all the Soviet people. The Red Army is the army of victorious socialism and an army that serves the people. Its steadfast strength expands infinitely. The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union has created a new type of soldier, unprecedented in history. Today, the Red Army and Navy take an oath, and from its resolute words, a typical soldier of a socialist country can emerge. This soldier is trained in loyalty and bravery and dedicates his entire life to the motherland. The anniversary of the Red Army is a day of celebration for our entire people and the working masses of the world. The Red Army and Navy are deeply imbued with the spirit and sentiment of internationalism. In all capitalist countries, there are many friends of the Red Army. All workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals are friends of the Red Army. They deeply know that the Red Army is a fortress of world peace, neither intimidating nor being intimidated. ×××××××××××, the sympathy of the world proletariat is the backing of the Red Army.”</p>

<h3>Hitler's Speech: Determined to Continue Pushing Forward, Not Afraid of Foreign Public Opinion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Munich, 25th] Hitler delivered a speech at a meeting of old comrades of the National Socialist Party in賀城, listing Germany's achievements over the past nineteen years. He pointed out that most of the National Socialist Party's plans had been completed, especially regarding the Jewish question, which he considered a success. The completion of the new economic system has enabled Germany to develop and become strong. The National Socialist Party will continue its efforts to actively promote the remaining planned projects. Regarding foreign public opinion, Hitler expressed no fear, saying, "At present, we are only being criticized. Even if all countries challenge us, I will never surrender. Germany will never repeat the failures of 1918," and so on.</p>
<h3>Belgian Cabinet Faces New Crisis Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 24th] The cabinet is now facing a new crisis again. The Socialist Party in the parliament has instructed to vote against the motion of confidence in the government. The Liberal Party has also declared its opposition to the current cabinet. If both parties vote against it at the same time, the government will inevitably fall.</p>
<h3>Germany Vigorously Expanding Trade with Latin America: U.S. Congressman Secrest Sends Letter to Hull Requesting Economic Sanctions</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] Congressman Secrest sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull requesting the adoption of economic sanctions against Germany, stating, "Germany is vigorously expanding trade with Latin American countries, becoming America's main competitor, and is even attempting to adopt various methods and unfavorable propaganda to oppose us. In trade, they are adopting unfair treatment towards us, so we have the right to implement economic sanctions and boycott German goods. Germany's trade situation last year was extremely poor, with an import surplus of over 400 million marks. The massive military expansion plan is also a reason affecting its industry and commerce," and so on.</p>

<h3>The Sino-Japanese War and the Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Chang; Original by ASIATICUS. Published in the January issue of Asia-America Magazine.</p>
<p>When Japan planned to conquer China, it often calculated future "great wars," even thinking of a series of linked "great wars." However, the unity of the Chinese military and civilians in a long-term resistance war, thus causing a "great war," was an insult to Japan. Japan's military preparations were aimed at attacking the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Only these three countries were worthy of being enemies in the "great war" with Japan for hegemony in the Pacific and Asia. Japan believed that China's resistance war could be dealt with using special techniques of "local incidents" and "short-term punitive wars." Its main strategic consideration was how to avoid interference from the great powers. It seemed indifferent to China's strong resistance war. Japan believed that establishing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Italy was very beneficial because this could prevent interference from the great powers in the Sino-Japanese incident, cover up the truth of the invasion, and implement the plan to save the two continents of Europe and Asia from the scourge of "communism." Japan's purpose in attacking the Soviet Union could be used as an excuse to quickly promote monopolizing the Chinese market. After monopolizing the Chinese market, the Far East would become a huge economic base, which would be very helpful for attacking the Soviet Union. This is natural. At the same time, it could also conveniently attack Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Japan hoped to benefit from the aggressive actions of Germany and Italy in Europe and the Mediterranean. Similarly, Hitler and Mussolini also believed that Japan's actions in the Far East were beneficial to them because Japan could force Britain and the United States to pay attention to the threat of war in the Far East. At the same time, it could also make the Soviet Union station elite troops and stockpile abundant raw materials in Siberia. The policies of Germany and Italy were aimed at changing the balance of power in Europe but not engaging in actual war with the British, French, and Soviet bloc (likely supported by the United States). This was related to Japan's ideal of controlling the balance of power in the Pacific. Therefore, Hitler created a Greater German Reich in Eastern and Central Europe, Mussolini turned the Mediterranean into an Italian lake, and Japan wanted to control the economically and politically linked Sino-Japanese "Manchukuo" group. After this, they would have a better advantage for attacking the Soviet Union. At the same time, Germany, Italy, and Japan could further threaten all "neutral" countries, preparing for the final control of the world and the division of the world. Japan could then seize possessions and interests in the South Pacific belonging to countries such as ××, Annam, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands!</p>
<p>It is very clear that Japan's plan for China must be implemented quickly. This is absolutely crucial for the entire plan to control the world. Japan can only defeat China, make the Chinese government surrender, and join the Anti-Comintern Pact to use ordinary traitors to establish a puppet regime and indirectly govern China. Under such circumstances, important ports would lose their superior position, the interests of Britain, the United States, and France would be greatly damaged, gradually leading to extinction. At the same time, Japan's position would be able to threaten Singapore—the gateway to the British Empire in Asia—and be able to establish a military security line isolating China and the Soviet Union. This is equally important for Mussolini and Hitler.</p>
<p>Japan's deep war, unable to achieve a swift victory, cannot but use a large number of troops, and cannot retain main force troops, can intimidate the world, threatening the Soviet Union and other powers, and the dream of a short-term conquest of China, has already become a delayed "great war," and this is enough to make Japan feel terrible. Moreover, Germany and Italy do not need this kind of great war. Furthermore, the resolute resistance of the entire Chinese nation has forced Japan to concentrate most of its military and financial resources in North China, Inner Mongolia, part of the Northwest, the Yangtze River basin, and the coastal areas. Currently, we cannot see any signs of a cessation of the war. Millions of Japanese troops cannot defeat the Chinese regular army, cannot stop the activities of the Chinese guerrillas to protect the growing transportation lines, and cannot suppress the resistance of patriotic Chinese in the "occupied" areas. Japan's temporary victory cannot eliminate the danger of failure and collapse. This is not only Japan's disaster but also the disintegration of the entire Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>The Anti-Comintern Pact has not been successful in Europe either. Although Czechoslovakia was slaughtered, Britain and France, and even the United States, have shamefully acquiesced to the aggression of Germany and Italy in Spain, without providing material support to the Spanish government. Here, the question of time is the most important. Italy can be said to have failed because it could not achieve a swift victory in Spain.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>The Case of Japanese Planes Bombing the New Territories</h3>
<p>The incident of Japanese planes bombing Luohu in the New Territories of Hong Kong is a completely planned ×××× by Japanese aggressors, and it is one of the separate manifestations of the same attempt as occupying Hainan Island and competing for the concessions in Shanghai. If this act is not met with the most severe protest and sanctions, the future harm will be ×××××××××! Regarding this point, the British government naturally recognizes it clearly.</p>
<p>Currently, this matter is being negotiated between the Japanese and British sides in Tokyo and×××××××. The Japanese side is completely following the planned program of using "accidental bombing" and "apology" to cover up its crime of destroying Hong Kong territory ××××××××. The British side naturally cannot be satisfied with this, so the negotiations have not made any progress.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the safety of Hong Kong and the status of Britain in the Far East, this type of incident will never happen again: (2) Effectively guarantee that British air transport in the Far East will not be subjected to any obstruction or attack: (3) Extensively compensate for the losses of this incident.</p>
<p>However, recent history proves that any guarantees and promises of fascist aggressors are most unreliable—therefore, this request must be realized with actual strength. The first is to strengthen Hong Kong and British military facilities in the Far East, especially to rapidly increase the strength of the Far East Air Force: The second is to quickly discuss methods of close cooperation with France and the United States to prevent aggression: the third is to step up cooperation with our country to defend the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Vietnamese transport, and at the same time develop Sino-British, French and American sky transport.</p>
<p>British interests are inseparable from the interests of China and all democratic and peaceful countries. Only by abandoning all policies of compromise with aggressors, only by intensifying the solidarity and assistance of democratic and peaceful countries, and only by bravely resisting aggressors in our country, can there be the most powerful guarantee.</p>
<h3>New Mission for Christians</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Association of the Chinese Christian Church in Guangdong has scheduled a joint worship service for members of the church from various regions of the mainland in Hong Kong today at 2:00 p.m. at the Wan Chai Methodist Church to pray for the national crisis. There will also be a report on frontline rescue work and a speech by the head of the youth service corps accompanying the army. We have a few words to say after seeing this news.</p>
<p>In recent times, the crazy atrocities of the Eastern and Western fascist aggressors have promoted and expanded the world war, killing human beings, destroying civilization, and insulting religion. This is something that angers everyone in the world, let alone Christians who have a glorious history and a great mission. Since the September 18th Incident, and especially since the start of the all-out war of resistance on August 13th, Chinese church members have sacrificed for the national crisis and served for the war of resistance. The greatness of their performance has been seen not only by the people of the country but also praised by the world. Among them, the most commendable are the organization of service corps accompanying the army, frontline rescue teams, comforting teams for wounded soldiers and refugees, and the extensive mobilization of the masses to go to the national crisis and relieve military disasters. Furthermore, the youth associations in various places hold current affairs lecture meetings, discussion meetings, organize national salvation propaganda teams, anti-Japanese choir groups, and perform dramas and sell items to raise donations for the country. These are all worthy of the greatest respect from patriotic compatriots across the country and righteous people in the world!</p>
<p>We hope that Christian church members can all recognize the true meaning of saving the motherland and saving the world, inherit the spirit of bravely facing difficulties and generously enlisting in the past, and unite even more to call on the masses to oppose the Japanese, German, and Italian aggressors who are plotting to destroy our motherland and destroy our world. The new mission is the most sacred, most solemn, and most urgent mission, and we must do everything possible and endure all hardships to complete it.</p>

<h3>Britain Will Send More Naval, Land, and Air Forces to Hong Kong for Defense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The British government is currently studying the report by British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, on his talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita (regarding the Japanese plane bombing incident in Hong Kong), as well as Japan's apology and promise of compensation and assurances that such incidents will not happen again. The British government considers the act of Japanese planes bombing British territory to be a very serious incident. Whether this incident can be considered over is a question that the British government is currently considering.</p>
<p>Forts Continue War Exercises, Light Control to Be Held Next Month</p>
<p>Furthermore, the British military authorities are paying close attention to this incident. To guard against any eventuality, they have already instructed the Scottish troops in the New Territories to take self-defense actions when necessary. According to reporters, the fort defense forces in Hong Kong have also been ordered to practice shooting. The Baisha Island fort practiced the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the army authorities again ordered the fort to practice war for two days. Other forts will also continue to hold exercises. When the Baisha Island fort practiced yesterday, it was from 6:30 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. The time today is from 12:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. During the exercise period, all ships are prohibited from traveling to and from. According to reporters, the air defense authorities, in view of the urgency of the current situation, will hold a light control exercise in mid-next month. It is also possible to hold it earlier within the possible scope. According to Western newspapers, in view of the urgency of the situation in the Far East, the British military authorities believe that the defense of the colonies of the Great British Empire must be strengthened under the cloud of war. Therefore, it has been decided to increase troops stationed in Hong Kong and Singapore when necessary, including the naval, land, and air forces.</p>
<p>× Plane Flew Over the Border Again, Dropping Absurd Leaflets Everywhere</p>
<p>According to the Tak Chee Daily, a × plane appeared again on the border of the New Territories yesterday (24th). The plane first soared near Shatoujiao in the Chinese territory and then flew towards Aotou Shenzhen. However, it did not drop bombs, only dropping absurd leaflets everywhere. Its route almost included the entire border of the New Territories, but there was no cross-border event. The border was as calm as usual yesterday. The number of refugees fleeing into the New Territories has greatly decreased. Regarding the incident of × planes bombing the New Territories yesterday (21st), the British diplomatic community recently stated that the British government did not pay much attention to it at first. After thoroughly investigating it, it was found that it was not comparable to an ordinary misunderstanding incident. It was considered more serious than initially observed. Through the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, repeatedly protesting to the ×× side, × Foreign Minister Arita has formally apologized to the British side and stated his willingness to compensate for the losses and impose appropriate punishment on those who overstepped the mark. However, the British side believes that the guarantees of preventing the same incident from happening again should have more practical and effective methods, and intends to insist on a more extensive scope of compensation for losses than currently planned.</p>

<h3>At the Annual Meeting of HSBC, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Reported That China's Financial Stability Is Due to the Government's Management of the Monetary System, Which Is Highly Praised: The Bank's Profits Reached 15 Million Yuan Last Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai HSBC Bank held its annual shareholders' meeting at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. Forty-nine people, including Chairman of the Board of Directors, Pearce, and shareholders, attended. First, the chairman proposed to approve the annual business report and delivered a concise speech, making a clear assessment of the financial trade and monetary system in the Far East.

<p>Regarding China's financial situation, Pearce said that it has become stable. Although the wartime situation has had some impact on China's finances, the bumper harvest in the Northwest and the sharp increase in remittances from overseas Chinese have helped the Chinese government stabilize its finances. Part of this is due to good income and most of it is due to proper management. The Chinese government has stabilized its finances.</p>
<p>Regarding the business situation of HSBC Bank, Pearce believes that it can be described as satisfactory. Although there have been various difficulties in the past twelve months, the net profit still reached 15,529,621.32 yuan. 3,338,304.53 yuan was deposited last year. The profit distribution method was stipulated as a dividend of one shilling, two pence, and seven-eighths per share, for a total of 400,000 pounds. In addition to the dividend, there was a balance of 12,145,172.08 yuan. The distribution method is as follows: a bonus of three pounds per share, for a total of 7,744,537.82 yuan, 1 million yuan allocated for building costs, and a total of 3,400,634.26 yuan carried over to next year's calculation.</p>

<h3>Fire in Tai Kok Tsui Yesterday Morning - Sixty Thatched Huts Destroyed - Two Thatched Huts Also Destroyed in Kowloon City</h3>
<p>Between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM yesterday morning, fires broke out in two locations, Kowloon City and Mong Kok. In Kowloon City, two thatched houses were destroyed, while in Tai Kok Tsui, fifty refugee huts were reduced to ashes. Although the losses were not very heavy, the victims were all ordinary people. This sudden accident is truly tragic. Details of the fires in both locations are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Kowloon City</p>
<p>At 1:55 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in a thatched house in Pak Ha Village, Kowloon City. The occupants of the house noticed the fire and immediately tried to put it out, but the fire had already grown and spread rapidly, making it impossible to control. They immediately sounded the alarm and reported to the fire station. The Mong Kok Fire Station dispatched the fourth, seventh, and three water tank trucks to the scene, while the Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Station also sent one truck to assist in the rescue. By this time, the fire had spread to neighboring houses. Fortunately, villagers assisted by fetching water to put out the fire. The fire was finally extinguished at around 2:00 AM. As a result, two thatched huts were burned down, resulting in a loss of several hundred dollars. Fortunately, no one was killed or injured.</p>
<p>Tai Kok Tsui</p>
<p>In addition, there is a large area of wasteland in Tai Kok Tsui, Mong Kok. Many poor laborers who cannot afford to rent houses live in thatched huts there. Consequently, there are over several hundred of these shanties. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in one of the shanties when a resident was burning incense and worshiping the gods in the early morning. During the worship, the palm leaf roof caught fire, and it quickly spread. The men and women in the house were unable to extinguish the flames and rushed to escape, shouting "Fire!" The entire shanty was quickly consumed by flames, and neighboring huts were also affected. At that time, the north wind was strong, and the fire spread rapidly with the wind, making it impossible to approach. The Mong Kok Fire Station and the Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Station, whose fire engines had just returned from Pak Ha Village, Kowloon City, received another report of the fire in Tai Kok Tsui and immediately rushed to put it out. When the fire engines arrived, they saw that about sixty thatched huts were already on fire. They opened several hoses and divided up the work to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished at 5:00 AM, but the sixty thatched huts had already been reduced to ashes. The loss was over two thousand dollars. When the fire broke out, the escaping residents lamented that all their property had been destroyed in an instant, and they could not help but shed tears.</p>
<h3>Happy Valley's Great Merriment - Spring Racing Season Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Special dispatch from our newspaper! The annual five-day Spring Racing Season began yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, even before 10:00 AM, many cars, trams, and buses were filled with passengers heading towards Happy Valley Racecourse. The trams and buses were extremely crowded, and many people, impatient to wait, set off on foot. The streets were filled with crowds of people surging eastward like a tide.</p>
<p>Happy Valley was packed with people, tens of thousands of spectators, old and young, rural and stylish, all came to join the fun. The women were dressed in red and green, adorned with flowers, walking around in groups, dazzling the eyes.</p>
<p>The grass in the center of the racecourse was still green, shining in the sunlight, contrasting beautifully with the white, magnificent grandstand and the colorful national flags.</p>
<p>Happy Valley, the entire Happy Valley, exuded an atmosphere of "happiness" in both its movement and stillness.</p>
<p>The clock in the grandstand pointed to 11:30 AM, and the first race, the "Fuzhou Cup Race," began amidst the clamor of voices. Everyone watched intently.</p>
<p>After 12:00 noon, because all the foreign firms, banks... had stopped working, more people came to watch the races. Strings of speeding cars brought batches of gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. The grandstand was full of people. The grandstand was also divided, with the so-called Members' Enclosure reserved for members of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Membership required an entrance fee of ten dollars and an annual fee of thirty-five dollars. Non-members had to be introduced by a member to enter the Members' Enclosure, with a daily fee of ten dollars for men and five dollars for women. The general public area charged a uniform admission fee of two dollars.</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM, after the end of the fifth race, the "Wong Nai Chung Race," an hour break was announced to allow the audience to have lunch. The spectators in the grandstand were busy going to the bar inside the hall. Holding expensive menus, they ordered dishes and asked for wine from the waiters. The general public outside the venue also flocked to nearby food stalls and vendors to find something to eat. Vendors selling fruits, candies... and snacks made a fortune.</p>
<p>During lunchtime, everyone was talking about "horse racing," of course. The 525,000 tickets sold for the one-dollar "Grand Sweepstakes" were the main topic of conversation. Everyone envied the first prize of over two hundred thousand dollars, and everyone longed for the arrival of the "Grand Sweepstakes Day" on the 27th. Everyone believed in their own good luck. They forgot everything else. In their minds, there were only horses, no, only money, horses are money!</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the sixth race began, and they were busy watching again. They were anxious for the horses, cheering for the horses, and also sighing for the horses. They were busy all day. Those who won money were elated, while those who lost money were dejected.</p>
<p>The first day of racing had twelve races. They were busy until after 6:00 PM before dispersing.</p>
<p>The Spring Racing Season lasts for five days. After the first day, there are still four days left: the 27th, 28th, March 1st, and 4th. During these four days, Happy Valley will be just as lively? Every day, tens of thousands of people come to chase, chasing after money.</p>
<p>Probably having money means happiness (?) In Happy Valley, there is money, and there are also women dressed luxuriously, there is eating, there is drinking, extravagant eating, extravagant drinking. There are cars, hundreds of luxurious new cars parked in the parking lot opposite the racecourse, as if holding a car exhibition. However, if you raise your head and look at the hills above Happy Valley, there are countless graves, tombstones, short monuments, all arranged in rows——</p>
<p>Money, women, eating, drinking, and graves, how ingenious! This simple picture symbolizes the entire life of the city.</p>
<h3>Standing on Academic Grounds to Seek Benefits for the Motherland - The Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Society Established Yesterday - Elected Lin Tiantuo, Wang Youjian, Cai Chusheng, etc., as Executive Committee Members</h3>
<p>(Special interview from our newspaper) The Chaozhou overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are a large number, exceeding two hundred thousand. In the North-South Bank Street (Bonham Strand West) area, Chaozhou dialect is the most prevalent language. They work hard and operate with a straightforward character, and have long held considerable important power in commerce and economy, bearing a long history. Their contributions in the cultural and educational fields have also been remarkable, but they lack organization, and their strength has not yet been concentrated. In order to "connect emotions, study academics, and jointly seek welfare for the motherland and hometown," the Chaozhou cultural figures in Hong Kong recently initiated the organization of the Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Society. Preparations have been completed, and a founding meeting was held at the English Capital Hotel at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. More than thirty Chaozhou cultural figures in Hong Kong attended, gathering together in a grand occasion. First, Chairman Wang Youjian announced the reasons for the meeting, then reported on the preparation process and passed the charter. Next, elections were held. The meeting concluded at around 4:00 PM. The results of the election show that the following were elected as executive committee members: Wang Youjian, Lin Tiantuo, Cai Chusheng, Chen Changwei, Luo Yinpu, Zhang Jiayan, etc. (7 people). The alternate committee members are: Zhang Dunde, Lu Fu, Lin Zishi, Cai Hansun, Wang Yongzai, etc. (4 people). Finally, the executive committee members mutually elected Lin Tiantuo as the chairman. Cai Chusheng, Luo Yinpu, and Chen Changwei will be in charge of the research department. Wang Youjian, Zhang Jiayan, and Wang Yongzai will be in charge of the general affairs department. The society stipulates that all Chaozhou compatriots residing in Hong Kong who have a passion for academic research, regardless of gender, age, or occupation, and who are willing to stand on academic grounds, work together, and enthusiastically seek welfare for the motherland and hometown, are eligible to be members of the society. After the society is established, it will regularly hold various academic research activities and various fitness training programs. Once the foundation is laid, it plans to focus on multi-faceted connections and mobilize fellow villagers living in various places to organize branch associations, so as to concentrate efforts towards the same goal.</p>

<h3>Clothes in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Yu Gen</p>
<p>"There are no poor people in Hong Kong." You may have heard "Old Hong Kong" say that (?) This statement is made because the Hong Kong people of the middle class are very keen on maintaining appearances. Even if they have to go hungry, they still dress beautifully to adapt to the urban environment where "one respects the clothes first, then the person."</p>
<p>This statement seems to be true, especially in the past few days – the Lunar New Year holidays. We see that the men, women, and children crowded on both sides of the road are all dressed very grandly. Some are in Western suits, some are in Chinese gowns and jackets, colorful cheongsams, furry fur coats, all kinds of colors and styles, Chinese and Western, are all available. Judging from the clothes of the pedestrians, there really are no poor people in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>At home, men may wear only athletic vests, "cowboy shorts" (shorts), and wooden clogs, and women may wear only pajamas, shorts, or underwear, shorts, and red clogs. But when they go out, men are neatly dressed in suits and shiny leather shoes, and women are in cheongsams, high-heeled shoes, and dressed like blooming flowers.</p>
<p>Perhaps Hong Kong people have a particularly keen sense of the climate (?) Many people know that Hong Kong people wear clothes "before it gets cold, they feel the cold; before it gets hot, they feel the heat." In September and October, when the thermometer drops to only 60 degrees, Hong Kong people put on wool suits, coats, cotton robes, and fur robes. Some men even wear aviator leather coats with fur collars, and women wear tiger skin, leopard skin, and squirrel fur coats, looking like "Eskimos." They have turned Hong Kong into a place resembling the Arctic!</p>
<p>The temperature is also 60 degrees, but in March and April, it is very different. Women show off their thighs and arms, wearing breathable "Sea Tiger silk" and transparent "Cicada Wing yarn," revealing their backs vaguely. Men also wear silk, spinning, white sharkskin, linen and other summer clothes. The "Arctic" Hong Kong is now regarded as Honolulu, Hawaii, or Malaysia.</p>
<p>Hong Kong people are very diligent in pursuing new fashions. The new clothes of London and Paris quickly appear here. The reason is that many people learn new clothes from watching movies. For example, if the movie shown at the × Cinema today features Danny DePardieu's coat without buttons, tomorrow many Hong Kong ladies will learn to wear coats without buttons. If the movie shown today features Robert Taylor wearing a suit with many seams on the back, tomorrow many Hong Kong young masters will learn to wear suits with many seams.</p>
<p>Many foreigners have such a question about Hong Kong people's beautiful and exquisite clothes: how can people who earn only twenty or thirty dollars a month dress so luxuriously and beautifully? Let me tell you a little, the common people have good ways to maintain appearances. For example, when making a suit, they will not spend the entire month's salary on a set of thirty-odd dollar suits, and then tighten their belts and not eat. They have what is called a "suit savings club." The method is that ten or eight like-minded friends organize a savings club with five or ten dollars per share. Everything is the same as an ordinary savings club, but the cash obtained after the members bid on the shares is only used to "make suits."</p>
<p>Some speculative tailor shops have a payment plan to facilitate customers. A set of thirty-dollar clothes can be paid in six or four months. Recently, there have also been "mooncake savings clubs" run by grocery stores and "roasted meat savings clubs" run by preserved meat stores, and there are methods for organizing "suit savings clubs." These "suit savings clubs" require each member to pay a certain amount per month. In the summer and winter of that year, you can choose a set of suits designated by them each time... all kinds of methods are nothing more than to facilitate people with low incomes so that they do not have to take out a large sum of cash at once.</p>
<p>If you want to be more "economical," there is also the second-hand clothing store route. There are many second-hand clothing stores in the Upper Ring Main Road and Shanghai Street in Yau Ma Tei. These stores sell "original pawned second-hand clothes" that have been pawned for too long and not redeemed, which are wholesale to them by pawnshops. There are also "new returned clothes" that customers have ordered from clothing stores but have not picked up after the deadline. It is said that this year, because of the × invasion, the mainland market was lost, and new and old clothes were accumulated in Hong Kong, so the prices were particularly cheap. A completely new suit can be bought for six or seven dollars, and an old one can be bought for two or three dollars. A man's coat can be bought for five or six dollars, and the most luxurious one is no more than ten dollars. Women's coats are even cheaper. A very nice one can be bought for three or five dollars, and one with a leather collar and a very new style is no more than ten dollars or so. This year can be said to be an opportunity for the common people to wear clothes.</p>
<p>A foreign saying goes: "Clothes make the gentleman." The eyes of urban people are very snobbish. Our clothes are often the first thing people look at. If the clothes are too casual, they will be looked down upon by most snobbish people. In this way, it is difficult for us to blame the common people for wearing clothes and maintaining appearances. The problem lies in the entire society.</p>

<h3>How to Criticize Drama</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Dramatic criticism is a kind of review work in the dramatic activity itself, and it is also an effort of general social literary criticism with dramatic activity as the object. Drama is one of the most primitive human spiritual activities. In the narration and depiction of legends, in the dance of religious rituals, the history of drama has already begun. From ancient times to the present, all ethnic groups in the world, without exception, take drama as a major provider of human spiritual food, a powerful influencer and important organizer of emotional activities.</p>
<p>At the same time, dramatic criticism has a history as long as dramatic activity.</p>
<p>Drama is different from other art departments. It is a comprehensive art, it is a body art, it is an art of action, it is an art of struggle. The activity of drama depends on the cooperation of the majority of people and the appreciation of the masses, so it is the most popular art. His image medium most easily and profoundly affects his object, so he is the most social art.</p>
<p>Precisely because of these, dramatic criticism is particularly necessary.</p>
<p>Dramatic criticism is qualitatively different from literary criticism in other departments. It is not an individual's appreciation of a static work of art, but a correct understanding and understanding of the dynamic group art activities from the perspective of a member of society, and a rigorous review and criticism.</p>
<p>This is the correct starting point for dramatic criticism: use the progressive viewpoint of society, the enjoyment of life, understand and capture the art of imitating (and creating) life, and see its significance in the advancing crowd: that is, the characteristic of dramatic criticism.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>What kind of drama there is, there is what kind of dramatic criticism, which is as true as saying "what kind of society there is, there is what kind of drama." Classical drama is regarded as the creation of words and literature, and the criticism at that time only looked at his skill of "chanting wind and playing with the moon." Later, drama gradually developed into entertainment and became a commodity, and dramatic criticism also became a commodity role - promoting actors and publicity, or a tool for commercial warfare - attacking and scolding, and punishing differences. When drama became a weapon of social struggle, dramatic criticism also became 100% political preaching, biased towards an angle of ideological struggle. Until the great battle for liberation began, drama became a mobilization of the masses. At the time of the launching, dramatic criticism began to embark on the road of obeying the war of resistance and serving the war of resistance.</p>
<p>For convenience, we can say that Chinese dramatic criticism has gone through the above-mentioned stages.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>How to criticize drama?</p>
<p>First of all, we can say that a critic, like an ordinary viewer, watches a play from beginning to end, and sees a story with a beginning and an end. His emotions unconsciously fluctuate with the development of the story. He intuitively accepts this continuous dynamic image. This is a step in collecting critical material. (This is equal to the second stage of creation, but the truth here is the same, so it is said that "criticism is creation.")</p>
<p>Secondly, from a story, we will naturally feel that there is a Moral (sense of right and wrong), an Idea (thought), and a theme (purpose, proposition). A rational reaction to this Moral, whether it is to agree with or oppose all or part of it, has already entered the realm of criticism.</p>
<p>Third, we will think about how the parts of a whole topic are coordinated, how the development line is, and how the structure is. All technical conditions have aroused our consideration. If the second stage is comprehensive, then this stage is analytical.</p>
<p>Fourth, we will further think about, what is the position of such a script and such a performance in many performances? What effect will it have on the progress of the entire dramatic movement? What impact will it have on the entire society? This utilitarian consideration can be said to be the social stage.</p>
<p>After the four stages of intuition, mixing, analysis, and social (evaluation), the critic has a definite grasp of the object of his criticism.</p>
<p>This is the common path that dramatic criticism must go through.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>How can a dramatic critic obtain the correct effect through these four stages? That depends on one's own cultivation—general and dramatic.</p>
<p>The issue of self-cultivation is also the condition that a dramatic critic must have.</p>
<p>First of all, a dramatic critic must have a correct world view. Because what drama reflects, records, promotes, and organizes is the social life of human beings. That life is diverse, complex, and contradictory. If he has not learned correct and progressive ideological methods and basic social knowledge, then his criticism is mechanical and often wrong.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that with general knowledge he can ascend to the throne of a critic. If based on a pattern or just general common sense, it is impossible to understand or help create great works, so:</p>
<p>Secondly, he must be very proficient in the knowledge of various departments. The detailed items and work progress of the drama are all necessary weapons for a critic.</p>
<p>It is not enough to be limited to the proficiency of dramatic technology.</p>
<p>Third, he must have a broad range of cultivation on the laws of general literature and art and on the characteristics of other departments, so that his spirit can be more broad and his understanding can be more profound.</p>
<p>Finally, a critic must be a worker and a participant in the movement, so that he can read a script and watch a performance as an organic part of a movement. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the critical function in the absorption and abandonment of work, and to establish a progressive, constructive, creative, and dynamic dramatic criticism.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>We cannot stay in the stage of "writers despise each other" and "mutually touting each other." We cannot be an association of critics like the "uncles' group" (actor fans). We don't need to talk about empty political theories. Therefore, to write good dramatic criticism, our critics must constantly learn and participate in practical work!</p>

<h3>One Year of Theater in the Isolated Island</h3>
<p>— Wei Lan</p>
<p>I. Starting from the Beginning of the Year</p>
<p>Shanghai became an isolated island, and most theater workers had to go to the interior. Just as the Chinese theater movement was on the rise, it suffered this major blow, and the theater movement on the isolated island became even more "isolated."</p>
<p>However, starting from 1938, the beginning of the year showed a gratifyingly vigorous phenomenon. The "Qingwu Drama Society" first performed "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Women's Apartment," "The Great Thunderstorm," and "Returning Home in Glory." Following that, the "Xiaofeng Drama Troupe" performed "Flood," and the Shanghai Art Drama Society performed "Women's Apartment" and "Mei Luo Xiang." But the vigorous phenomenon was only temporary, and then it declined again.</p>
<p>II. The Dissolution of "Qingwu"</p>
<p>To the "Shanghai Drama Art Society"</p>
<p>The "Qingwu Drama Society" was a group of considerable size. Unfortunately, after several large-scale performances, internal disagreements arose, resulting in its dissolution. A portion of the members organized the "Xiaofeng Drama Troupe" and recruited several movie stars, such as the deceased Shang Guanwu. Another portion of the members organized the "Shanghai Art Theater," headed by Li Jianwu and Gu Zhongyi. The Xiaofeng Drama Troupe was suspected of having a certain suspicious source of funding, which was first revealed by the "Shanghai Evening Post", and consequently, it soon died out. "Shanghai Art" actively participated in the Shanghai community's relief performances for refugees shortly after its establishment, receiving threatening letters, but later still strived to perform. However, it was soon forced to cooperate with the "Sino-French Friendship Association" due to personnel and environmental issues, becoming the "Shanghai Drama Art Society" under the name of the drama group of the Sino-French Friendship Association. It was registered with the French Municipal Council Bureau, consolidating its foundation, and now it can be considered the only large theater troupe on the isolated island. It possesses excellent actors and technical talents, first-class directors such as Wu Renzhi, Xu Xingzhi, and Li Jianwu, and first-class playwrights You Jing, Gu Zhongyi, and others are all sponsors of the society. Actors such as Lan Lan, Xia Xia, Shu Shi, Zhou Qi, Xu Li, Xia Feng, Wu Mei, and others are all basic actors, contributing the highest level of performance to each performance.</p>
<p>The first performance of the "Shanghai Art Drama Society" was on September 23, 24, and 25, 1938, at the French Municipal Council Hall, performing "The Beginning of Man," originally written by the French writer Barro and translated by Zheng Yanyi, adapted by Gu Zhongyi, and directed by Wu Renzhi. It was performed twice and received quite a good response. The second performance was "The Struggle Between Love and Death," originally written by Romain Rolland and translated by Li Jianwu, directed by Xu Xingzhi. At the same time, O'Neill's new type of one-act play "Before Breakfast" was also performed, directed by Li Jianwu, for four consecutive days from October 27 to 30, and replayed on November 5 and 6. The results were very satisfactory, and the performance of "Before Breakfast," a new type of one-act play and a one-person play, was very successful and received good reviews.</p>
<p>III. "Weekly Small Theater"</p>
<p>To the "Drama Association"</p>
<p>Although the isolated island has formed, there are many fundamental members of theater workers who have not left Shanghai. They have organized many small drama groups within their own scope. Although they are "small," their aspirations are great and their orientation is good. The organizing members are mostly middle school and university students and general amateur drama enthusiasts, shop assistants, employees of banks and money shops, and customs officers, staff of refugee shelters, refugees, and workers. The "Weekly Small Theater" united them, led them, and supported them. However, the plan of "Weekly Small Theater" was not fully realized. It only united the small groups in form, and there was still a lack of unity among the actual groups.</p>
<p>Not long ago, "Weekly Small Theater" was suspended. Recently, after reorganization, it became the current "Shanghai Drama Association" and continues the mission of "Weekly Small Theater". The organization is more sound than before, and the work is also developing well. There are about ten or twenty small theater troupes participating in the "Association", and their performances are all assisted by it, especially in terms of stage technology. If participating troupes have performances, they must report their performance plans in detail to the "Association", and there is good communication between them. Therefore, the actions of small theater troupes have received correct theoretical criticism and guidance. The leaders of the "Association" are also the key members of the various small theater troupes. Although they are not famous, they are all very capable and dedicated and hardworking.</p>
<p>IV. New Mutations in Civilization Drama</p>
<p>Movie stars Gu Menghu and Bai Hong entered the "Queen's Theater" from spoken drama for the sake of livelihood, attempting to improve civilization drama. However, they used the method of spoken drama to improve it, and as a result, they did not achieve success, and they suffered losses and failed.</p>
<p>Now, they are implementing civilization drama at the "Green Treasure Theater" of the New New Company. Fortunately, under their efforts to improve it, the civilization drama of the "Green Treasure Theater" is on the way to success. At the very least, the scenery and lighting have made significant progress in technology.</p>
<p>V. The Activity of Small Theater Troupes</p>
<p>There are too many theater troupes in Shanghai. Because there are so many, everyone works very hard, so there are often small performances. However, most of them still participate in entertainment-type performances, and they often feel a lack of talent and quality when performing alone.</p>
<p>In addition to the two large performances of the "Shanghai Drama Art Society" in November, the "Silver Money Drama Troupe" also gave a large performance.</p>
<p>The Silver Money Drama Troupe of small theater troupes is an organization of drama enthusiasts among the staff of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and various banks and money shops. Before the large performance, they held a practice performance in the hall of the "Ningbo Fellow Association" in November, with programs such as "White Tea" and "Zhang Guan Li Dai", with mediocre results. On November 23 and 24, they performed "Sunrise" at the Lido Theater, directed by Xia Feng. The results were quite good.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the "Guiyan Drama Society" of "Private Shanghai Middle School" and the "Longmen Drama Society" of "Provincial Shanghai Middle School", with the assistance of the "Association", held an exchange performance at the "Municipal Council North District Elementary School". The programs were Guiyan's "Endurance" and "Locked Box", directed by Director Hu, who worked hard among the various small theater troupes, and Longmen's collectively directed "Winter" and Xu Li's directed "The Proposal". This performance gave a good impression, and "Endurance", "Locked Box", and "The Proposal" all had very wonderful performances.</p>
<p>December can perhaps be said to be the most vigorous time for the isolated island theater movement in 1938, as if echoing the vigorous phenomenon at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Christian Student Groups Federation staged Ouyang Yuqian's adaptation of the demonic "Dark Forces" on December 17 and 18 at the French Municipal Council Hall, directed by Ms. Gai Lan. The nature of this performance was charitable fundraising, with ticket prices starting at one yuan, but it was a great success and the performance was very good.</p>
<p>On the 19th, Zhizhong Girls' Middle School took the opportunity to celebrate the school anniversary and held a "Refugee Relief Entertainment Gala" at the Lyceum Theater, where foreign songs and dances were performed. In addition to music and other programs, the Shanghai Drama Art Society participated in the performance of "Women's Apartment" in two shows, day and night. The day show was also a one-act play "Artist" directed by Xu Li, and the night show was an English six-act play "Peerless Beauty" directed by Zhang Zhongying, performed by students of the school.</p>
<p>VI. "Sino-French Drama Art School"</p>
<p>And "Drama Service Society"</p>
<p>Small theater troupes not only lack actors and directors, but also have difficulty solving the problems of scripts, technical talents, and performance venues. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the "Drama Group of the Sino-French Friendship Association" and the "Chinese Opera Research Society" and general Sino-French enthusiasts of art and drama jointly established a Sino-French Drama Art School to cultivate general theatrical talents.</p>
<p>The Sino-French Drama School's implementation plan is divided into three phases. The first phase is to first run a class of spoken drama research crash course and a class of Kunqu opera research crash course, emphasizing both theory and practice, graduating in one year. The second phase is to add several advanced courses, graduating in two years. The third phase is to build its own school buildings, libraries, theaters, etc. The plan is so gratifying, but I don't know if it can be realized. You Jing, Xu Xingzhi, Wu Renzhi, and others are all professors at the school, and the principal is Feng Zhizhong. The enrollment results for the spoken drama and Kunqu opera classes totaled twenty or thirty students, and classes started on October 1.</p>

<h3>The Second Salvation Drama Troupe Will Go Abroad to Publicize - Expected to Arrive in Hong Kong Within Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Drama World Salvation Association, the wartime mobile Second Salvation Drama Troupe (referred to as the Second Salvation Drama Troupe), left Shanghai in August last year, and has passed through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou, and Shangcheng and Macheng counties in the Dabie Mountains. Then it went south along the Yuehan Railway, turning to Xiang and entering Gui, educating and mobilizing the public all the way by performing dramas and singing, achieving very good results. When it set out from Shanghai, there were only fourteen people, led by the progressive movie star Mr. Jinshan and Ms. Wang Ying. Along the way, it attracted many excellent comrades. Because of the hard work and serious life, it has been praised and welcomed by military and political authorities and people from all walks of life everywhere. Recently, they have been staying in Guilin, continuing to publicize the art of the War of Resistance, and have performed famous national defense dramas such as "The Battle of Taierzhuang", which has won the praise of the general public. Now, in order to expand the salvation propaganda abroad and appeal to overseas Chinese on behalf of the soldiers on the front lines, it has been decided recently to go to Southeast Asia to perform dramas for a period of six months. According to a letter from a comrade in the team, they set out from Gui around the tenth of this month to come to Hong Kong, and will stay in Hong Kong for a short period of time. It is expected that they will arrive within these few days!</p>
<p>Hong Kong Drama League Performance</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the salvation theater movement in Hong Kong has suddenly flourished, and small-scale theater troupes have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. In December last year, due to environmental needs, they organized the Hong Kong and Kowloon Youth Drama Association, with more than 20 small theater troupes participating. Now, some youth drama groups in Hong Kong have organized the Hong Kong Drama Federation. Since the launch of the initiative, the Cloud Friends Drama Society, the Youth Troupe, the Xuezhen West Section Drama Troupe, the Dingchou Drama Society, the Nonggong Society, and the Huazhong School Drama Troupe have registered to join. Now they have scheduled to hold the first joint performance this afternoon (26th) at 7 pm at the Caroline Hill Confucius Hall. In addition to the spoken drama troupe, the Junior Chorus and the Xuezhen Middle Section Training Class and Huayi College will be responsible for singing and chorus. It is expected that there will be a lot of excitement at that time!</p>

<h3>Promoting the Art of the War of Resistance, the China Art Troupe Holds a Traveling Charity Performance, and a Second Performance Will Be Held in Mid-March</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Art Troupe has been working very actively. In addition to its first performance at the Hong Kong Central Theater and the Kowloon Puqing Theater last month, it also performed for the Hong Kong Chinese Youth Relief Association at the beginning of this month, with good results. It is said that the troupe has now scheduled a second performance at the Central Theater in mid-March, with six plays to be performed: 1. "The Demonic Power" adapted by Ouyang Yuqian from Tolstoy's original work, 2. "Chinese Man" newly compiled by Hu Chunbing, 3. "Fisherwoman" from the original French work of Barro, 4. "Losing Oneself in Triumph", a famous work by Chen Baichen, 5. The Soviet satirical comedy "The Government Inspector", 6. Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm". Now, in addition to actively rehearsing new dramas under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian to prepare for the performance, they are also holding traveling charity performances to respond to the one-yuan debt repayment movement and promote the art of the War of Resistance. Yesterday, the troupe sent letters to various charitable organizations in Hong Kong, requesting assistance in carrying out the project. Now, the original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, This troupe is a professional theater troupe. In order to promote the theater movement, there should be regular performances every month to develop itself. However, this troupe does not belong to an individual, nor does it only belong to a small number of members. The colleagues are willing to contribute all their energy to the nation, country, and society. Although their ability is limited, they still want to do their best. For this reason, we now intend to take out a portion of our time to perform national defense dramas in various community organizations and schools on a voluntary basis to facilitate publicity. We hope that you will give us your sponsorship in many ways, and we have made the following methods. Please give us your instructions and inform various community organizations and schools so that we can receive treatment. With regard to the public interest - the attached methods are as follows: (1) Any school or community organization with a gathering of more than 20 people can invite this troupe to perform. (2) The performance of dramas is limited to one-act or one-scene, two-act national defense dramas. (3) The scenery, costumes, and transportation costs are all completely borne by this troupe, and no fees will be charged. (4) The performance date, time, and location must be agreed upon by both parties at least five days in advance. After obtaining a written reply from this troupe, it can be announced. (5) It cannot be accepted during this troupe's performance period. (6) The purpose of this performance is to cooperate with the national revival movement and make effective publicity. It is intended not to sell tickets. If it is necessary to slightly charge for tickets in order to limit the number of people, then the income will be used entirely as donations to respond to the one-yuan debt repayment movement and may not be used for other purposes. (7) If there are special circumstances that need to be discussed by both parties, they can be negotiated and resolved temporarily. (8) The above provisional methods may be considered at any time in order to adapt to the situation if there are obstacles in implementation.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Spoken Drama Groups Launch Yellow Flower Festival Charity Performance "Huanghuagang" - More Than Forty Theater Troupes Will Unite to Perform</h3>
<p>The China Art Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and the Guangdong Drama Association's Hong Kong colleagues and other three major drama groups, in order to unite all Hong Kong drama groups to work together, and to provide emergency relief to Shenzhen and Kam Tin refugees, specially launched a joint performance of "Huanghuagang" on March 29 this year, the Yellow Flower Festival, by more than forty Hong Kong drama groups. This kind of joint large-scale performance can be considered an unprecedented grand event in Hong Kong, and its significance is twofold: one is to unify the front line of the Hong Kong drama world, and the second is to provide relief to homeless refugees. Recently, the three groups have held two symposiums.

<h3>Today's All-Star Game at Caroline Hill: South China vs. Hong Kong Combined Team in a Charity Match; Hui Tang and Anderson Leading Their Respective Sides to See Who Has the Superior Skills</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the Human Day festival and the upcoming Lantern Festival, looking far into the distance only brings sadness upon returning home. We may have drunk the New Year's wine, but our sorrow remains unresolved. We must not forget the vengeance of [omitted character] Day and should strive harder. Let us sincerely save the nation, setting aside the usual New Year's greetings, uniting our efforts, and hoping for victory in the war of resistance. Those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. I will follow behind with my pen.</p>
<p>The British Relief Fund Society, after establishing a branch in Hong Kong, has achieved remarkable results in relief work. Recently, the society's president, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, sent a letter to the Football Association, requesting a charity football match to raise funds for disaster relief. The Association, considering the matter a charitable cause, could not refuse. With the agreement of South China Athletic Association, they will send a team to compete against the Hong Kong Combined Team. All proceeds will go to the branch. It is true that everyone desires to do good. Who would not be like us? Relying on the efforts of twenty-two football players, we can save countless lives from the aftermath of war. We hope that philanthropists will attend, making this meaningful football match today a lively and positive event.</p>
<p>The South China team has a complete lineup. Li Huitang is determined to play center-forward, while Zhang Rongcai will be the goalkeeper. Liu Songsheng will play left-wing, giving the formation a fresh look. On the Hong Kong Combined Team side, Anderson will lead the way. During the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Games, he not only showed no signs of aging but also gave an excellent performance, shining brightly. He and Hui Tang can be considered unparalleled. Today, Anderson and Li will lead their respective sides, surely showcasing their unique skills and engaging in a great contest of magic, making for a tense and exciting match.</p>
<p>Chinese stars Xu Jingcheng and Hou Rongsheng have also been selected for the Hong Kong Combined Team, adding to its splendor. The goalkeeper, serving in the military, is Hong Kong's red player. It remains to be seen if the team's fierce arrows can break through his closed-door policy. Right-winger Fula was bravely injured during the Interport Games and hospitalized. Unable to play today, he will be replaced by Amberson. In short, all the stars are gathered, and they will surely contribute greatly. Football fans who want to see a good show should arrive early. The lineups for both teams are listed below:</p>
<p>(South China Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai (South China South)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South China South), Mai Shaohan (South China South)</p>
<p>Liu Weipei (South China Chinese), Liang Rongzhao (South China South), Liu Qingcai (South China South)</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng (South China Chinese), Li Zhaorong (South China [omitted character]), Li Huitang (South China Athletic Association), Feng Jingxiang (South China South), Deng Guangsen (South China South)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Combined Team)</p>
<p>Healey (Kowloon Club)</p>
<p>Shi Han (Middlesex), Hou Rongsheng (Kwong Wah Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng (Eastern Athletic Association), Biludu (St. Joseph's), Hanni Bo (Kowloon Club)</p>
<p>Morse (Police Club), Soo Shi (Middlesex), Anderson (St. Joseph's), Kenny (Middlesex), Amberson (Artillery Team) (Substitute) Reggie (Army Ordnance Corps), Yishi Dulange (Hong Kong Club), Wulie Zhi (Kowloon Club), Packa (Police Club)</p>
<p>In addition to the charity match, there will be four league matches for Divisions A, B, and C. In Division A, St. Joseph's will play against the Navy at the Navy Ground. St. Joseph's forward Anderson will be playing for the Hong Kong Combined Team in the charity match today, so their attack will definitely be affected. Moreover, the Navy is a strong team with high hopes of winning the championship. Driven by this hope, they will surely put forth their best effort. St. Joseph's strength is already not as good, and now they are missing Anderson, so the outcome of the match is predictable.</p>

<h3>South China's Two Teams Both Compete: The Younger Team Loses, the Elder Team Wins; Eastern Defeats South China Chinese 4-2; South China South Wins Against Hong Kong Club by a Score of 6-0</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, there were two consecutive Division A league matches at the Hong Kong Club Ground: (1) Eastern vs. South China Chinese, (2) South China South vs. Hong Kong Club. The number of spectators did not decrease due to the Spring Racing Carnival, likely because paying once allowed them to watch two good matches, which was considered affordable and worthwhile.</p>
<p>Eastern Defeats South China Chinese</p>
<p>Eastern Had a Full Lineup, While South China Did Not</p>
<p>When the first match began, Eastern's lineup was complete, while South China Chinese did not field their full strength. Tan Jun'gan and Yang Shuiyi were nowhere to be seen, making their attack and defense weak. How could they resist the energized Eastern team? However, in the initial exchanges, Eastern was somewhat careless and fond of dribbling. Although their attack was strong, they could not break through the defense. When South China Chinese launched a chance counterattack, Eastern immediately conceded, losing 0-1. Only then did they realize the opponent was not to be taken lightly and immediately corrected their mistakes, finally equalizing five minutes after conceding to make it 1-1 at half-time. In the second half, after ten minutes, South China Chinese took the lead again to make it 2-1. The loss of this goal was entirely due to Xian Han's unstable handling of the ball, which slipped out of his hands, allowing Genbao to rush in. If Xian Han had been calm and composed, this goal would not have been scored.</p>
<p>After the Match, Chengtao Was Deemed the Most Valuable Player</p>
<p>The best performer throughout the match was Chengtao. His interceptions were sharp, and his passing was accurate, earning much praise. Eastern's ability to turn defeat into victory was due to this player's fast-paced delivery. Although Li Deqi scored three consecutive goals, his hesitation and missed opportunities hampered the team's morale. South China Chinese's ability to take the lead twice with such a lineup was testament to the efforts of their forward line. However, their defense seemed much weaker than before, with numerous dangerous situations in front of the goal, often in a passive position. Zhu Zhaohang bravely defended alone, but his efforts were futile.</p>
<p>[Eastern Team]</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Miao Huaguo, Hui Zhongyun</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan, Song Lingsheng, Liu Shidu</p>
<p>Hou Chengtao, Xu Jingcheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingshi</p>
<p>[South China Chinese]</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaohang</p>
<p>Hua Mao, Liang Baiwei</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong, Lin Depu, Liu Weipei</p>
<p>Tan Zhenhui, Qu Shie, Chen Dehui, Yang Genbao, Ye Runbo</p>
<p>Genbao Scores First</p>
<p>After the match started and the teams battled for fifteen minutes, South China Chinese broke through the encirclement and launched a fierce counterattack. Runbo crossed from the wing, Dehui headed the ball, and Genbao flicked it in, making it 1-0 to South China Chinese. (Eighteen minutes) Eastern were inspired and ordered a full-scale attack, surrounding South China's goal. Qixiang shot from a key position, but Liu Mao hilariously blocked it. Although Chengtao regained possession, Baiwei quickly intercepted him, making it futile. (Twenty minutes) Shidu snatched the ball in the middle and sent it to Li Deqi. Qixiang received Li Deqi's quick pass and immediately shot, but Zhaohang could not save it, making it 1-1.</p>
<p>South China's Weak Defense Concedes Three Goals</p>
<p>In the second half (ten minutes), Zhenhui dribbled the ball and chased, lobbing it towards the goal. Xianhan carelessly caught the ball and fumbled it, allowing Genbao to lead the charge and kick the ball into the net, making it 2-1 and putting South China ahead again. (Twelve minutes) Lingsheng suddenly broke through in the middle and passed the ball to Chengtao. Chengtao cut through defenders and shot, hitting the post and bouncing back. Deqi arrived in time and added another kick, equalizing 2-2. (Twenty-two minutes) Chengtao repeated his side attack, making a solo raid and passing a wonderful ball. Deqi met the ball and headed it, hitting the goal post and bouncing back. Deqi turned around and hooked the ball in, making it 3-2. (Thirty-three minutes) Chengtao repeated his old trick, with Weipei and Baiwei failing to stop him. Deqi took advantage of his wonderful pass and performed a flying kick, shooting the ball into the net, making it 4-2. Eastern finally won at the end of the match.</p>
<p>South China South Defeats Hong Kong Club</p>
<p>A Large Disparity in Strength; No Excitement</p>
<p>After the match between Eastern and South China Chinese ended, South China South and Hong Kong Club began their match. There was little excitement. Initially, Hong Kong Club was able to resist, showing some strength. However, after several dozen rounds, they gradually showed weaknesses and eventually collapsed. By the time the final whistle blew, South China South had given Hong Kong Club a "shutout," making it a new record for South China South's winning score in the second week of the league. The reason for South China South's overwhelming victory was their complete lineup and the dedication of their soldiers. Rongcai's goalkeeping performance was exceptionally calm, catching every wonderful shot from the opponent. He can be called a goalkeeping master. The two defenders and three midfielders defended firmly, leaving no gaps for the opponent to exploit. The five forwards were as lively as dragons and tigers, moving like lightning. As for Hong Kong Club's defeat, the most obvious reason was the weakness of their defense, with their defenders and two backfielders being ineffective. The midfielders were also less skilled, especially Meilington, who was the most incapable, failing to stop South China's attack. The forwards also had poor coordination, and their shooting lacked accuracy. Only left-winger Lingzhi was somewhat commendable.</p>

<p>Luozhi, Jueji, Weiluxun, Dejilv, Yandachen</p>
<p>Rongcai's Save Earns Praise</p>
<p>At the start, Hong Kong Club kicked off. Douwen intercepted the ball, went straight up the wing, and shot towards the goal, but Gaolusi caught it. Then Feng and Li advanced together, like two dragons emerging from the sea. Li shot twice in succession, the former going too high and the latter being caught. Hong Kong Club narrowly escaped a disaster and tried their best to counterattack. Luozhi shot towards the goal, accurately and powerfully. Rongcai calmly moved his hands, sending the ball out of danger, earning applause from the fans. After about sixteen minutes of fierce fighting, Zhaorong intercepted the ball. The two defenders tried to stop him but were passed. Zhaorong then dribbled the ball alone and charged forward. After a few steps, he lifted his foot and shot towards the goal. Gaolusi jumped but missed, and the ball slipped into the net. After the restart, En[omitted character] intercepted the ball again and passed it diagonally to Guangsen, who launched a surprise attack from the wing, as fast as a meteor. By the time Meilington chased him, Guangsen had already reached the enemy's territory. Gaolusi saw Guangsen shooting and jumped to save, but he missed again, conceding the second goal, making it 2-0. Afterwards, Hong Kong Club desperately counterattacked. Luozhi charged towards the goal several times, but South China South defended firmly, only forcing a corner kick. Later, Rongcai committed a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. However, Qi An shot wide, and the first half ended.</p>
<p>South China's Momentum is Strong; They Take What They Want</p>
<p>During the break, South China South's morale increased, and they took what they wanted, dominating the match. After battling for a while, Zhaorong took advantage of Rongzhao's pass and instantly advanced to a key position. Gaolusi went out to meet the danger, and Zhaorong easily kicked the ball into the net. Six minutes later, South China South's forwards charged again like an avalanche. Qi An and Shi Dulange saw the situation was too dangerous and desperately intercepted, but En[omitted wedge symbol] was too clever, dodging and weaving. Finally, he kicked the ball into the net. Afterwards, Jingxiang performed a hundred-step piercing willow skill, hitting the bullseye. Enliang followed suit, and it was also successful. Before long, the match ended, with South China South winning 6-0. It was difficult to support alone; even if they wanted to avoid defeat, how could they?</p>
<p>After the battle broke out, the ball went back and forth, and the teams fought fiercely. The American team's attack was strong, surrounding the Scottish team's goal. Within a minute, Tiwanxiang scored a goal, but the linesman ruled it out for being offside, and the American team only had a moment of happiness. However, their attack did not weaken. Five minutes later, the American team forced a corner kick. McGarettie kicked it in beautifully, and Hamwen added another kick, directly hitting the bullseye, making it 1-0 to the Americans. The Scottish team counterattacked, and Hoxi's midfield defense was quite effective. However, they lacked strategy and were greedy for success, shooting aimlessly and failing to score. The American team took the opportunity to counterattack, and Tito broke through on a solo run, scoring the second goal. The Scottish team was not convinced and attacked again. Wenlu shot from twenty yards and hit the post, bouncing back into the net, making it 2-1. After a long period of chaotic fighting, Falaming carelessly touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area. Suo Shi scored the penalty kick, and the first half ended with the American team leading 3-1. After switching sides and starting the second half, the American team's prestige was even greater, dominating the match. The Scottish team could only defend and had no power to counterattack. The situation became one-sided. Soon, Hamwen flashed in, passed Fraser, and shot the ball into the net. Before long, Suo Shi made a solo run and scored again from five yards, making it 5-1 at the end of the match. Middlesex defeated Scott 5-1.</p>
<h3>Kwong Wah Courageously Defeats Police Club</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, in the Division A football league match, Kwong Wah faced Police Club at the Boundary Street Playground. After returning in triumph from Australia, Kwong Wah rode the momentum and smashed the Police Club, who had just won the special silver medal, into pieces, winning with a score of 4-2. They avenged their failure in the first week. At the opening whistle, Kwong Wah immediately took the offensive, with their five forwards chasing the ball in different directions. The police defenders resisted strongly. Zhou Wenzhi took the opportunity to kick the ball into the net during a melee in front of the goal, scoring first. After a melee lasting fifteen minutes, Zhuo Shijin shot from fifteen yards, piercing the willow with a hundred steps, scoring with one shot. The veteran players could do nothing. Kwong Wah scored two goals in fifteen minutes, greatly increasing their prestige. The police attempted to retaliate, and Gui Cai launched a fierce attack, but Guo Qi sacrificed himself to save the day. Zhou Wenzhi roamed in the midfield, distributing the ball well, and was extremely active. Jing Cong received Zhou's long pass and passed it to Chi Fen, who shot into the net with lightning speed and ear-covering technique, making the score 3-0. The first half ended with this score.</p>
<p>After changing sides in the second half, the police repeatedly tried to avenge their humiliation, sending everyone out. The three defenders moved forward to help with the attack. The defenders used the tactic of luring the enemy offside to stop the progress of the Kwong Wah forwards. For a moment, Kwong Wah's goal was in danger, and the defenders fought bravely. With the police emptying their defense by moving everyone forward, Chi Fen received a pass from Hou Ziyuan and went on a solo run, but his shot went wide, narrowly missing a sure goal. Shortly after, Wenzhi shot quickly, but it was unsuccessful. Chi Fen repeated his old trick, getting another good chance, but he was too anxious and missed the opportunity. Shortly after, Jing Cong angrily swept the ball, but the old goalkeeper saved it. In the last five minutes, the police ordered an all-out attack. Hou Zi committed a foul in the penalty area, and a penalty kick was awarded. Hou Lvnan kicked it in, and the whistle blew for the end of the match. Kwong Wah finally avenged their previous defeat with a score of 4-2. The lineups for both sides were as follows: (Ball Boys)</p>

<h3>Middlesex Defeats Scott; Scott Can Only Defend and Cannot Counterattack</h3>
<p>(Special Report from our Newspaper) In the first week of the match between the Scottish Army Scott and Middlesex, the teams tied 1-1. At that time, the two sides still had the same lineup, and the match was difficult to determine. Yesterday was the second week, and the two teams met again at the So Kon Po Ground. However, the situation had changed drastically. Middlesex's players Watson Gorogan and others had left the team and returned to their country, and Scott's players Polo Du and others had also left. Both teams' fighting strength had weakened. Fortunately, Middlesex had no shortage of rising stars, and their strength was only slightly affected. However, the Scottish Army suffered from a lack of good players, and their strength was declining. Yesterday, they faced Middlesex like a small witch meeting a big witch. They could only defend and had no power to counterattack. The situation became one-sided. As a result, Middlesex easily defeated Scott with a score of 5-1.</p>
<p>The battle was chaotic and had no excitement at all. Scott's defeat was purely due to a lack of good players, which affected their defense. Adamson was incompetent, and Lishi Liverji took over the important task of helping with the attack and defense, but he had no strengths. This gave Middlesex left-winger Hamwen the opportunity to break through. Scott's loss of each goal was due to the weakness of this side. The front line [omitted character] Xi had courage but no strategy, and he was greedy for success, shooting aimlessly whenever he had a good opportunity. Only Fraser Wenlu was qualified, but he was difficult to support alone.</p>
<h3>Film and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment... Marie Antoinette</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette</p>
<p>This film, in every aspect, deserves to be called a great success. Every scene in the film is filled with touching romances and tense, terrifying tragedies. At the same time, Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power, in their first collaboration, were able to vividly portray the tragic fate of a French queen. Their acting in the film has reached the highest peak of artistic expression.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer plays an Austrian princess full of passion and hope, who unfortunately marries the mentally dull Louis XVI. Disappointed, she indulges in a life of luxury and debauchery and falls in love with Duke Fersen. However, she eventually squanders the nation's wealth, indulges in lust, and is not understood by the people. Combined with Louis's mediocrity, this leads to widespread suffering and the outbreak of revolution. In this era of turmoil, her extremely tragic fate is created.</p>
<p>The film brings this moving historical event to life on the screen. The sets and costumes are also extremely magnificent. At the same time, the film vividly depicts the queen's extravagant and debauched life, the environment that shaped her character, and the situation of the French Revolution at the time, further enhancing the film's realism. This "Marie Antoinette" is a work that is highly worth recommending to the audience.</p>

<p>The aerial scenes shot in color are definitely successful. Previously, in "[omitted character] Island Goddess," there was a scene of an airplane flying in the sky, and the beauty of the sky's colors left a very beautiful impression. In this film, this point is further developed. The sky is too beautiful. Perhaps many people who watch this film will want to fly an airplane leisurely in that lovely blue sky.</p>
<p>The story seems a bit too long, but it tells the story of the American aviation industry over the past thirty or forty years, from its inception to the present, focusing on three young people who have devoted their lives to aviation. The two male leads, Fredric March and Ray Milland, are competent. The female lead is a newcomer, Ruth Campbell. Judging from this film, she is a very promising new star.</p>
<p>Grandview... Baroness and the Butler</p>

<p>Little Miss Broadway</p>
<p>Shirley Temple is undoubtedly recognized as the most popular little singer on the screen today. Of course, it is the business acumen of 20th Century Fox to have her star in this play.</p>
<p>As for the plot, it is still the same old, tired, and extremely contrived and vulgar story. The only watchable scene is when she leaves the orphanage and says goodbye to her friends in the orphanage. The rest is quite disappointing.</p>
<p>Shirley has grown a bit older. Thank you to the Hollywood movie merchants for creating a "grown-up" tone for her, of course, a "Hollywood-style" grown-up tone. The true innocence of a child is not much left in her, and soon, I believe that even this point will be destroyed.</p>
<p>The songs are okay, but the scenes are not grand. The final scene, "Court Theater," is also unremarkable.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>Thoughts for Consideration</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone asked me if I had studied philosophy, meaning to advise me to study a little philosophy. Not wanting to miss an opportunity to gain some knowledge, I presumptuously raised the question of whether philosophy is essentially contemplation or belief. This question may be unphilosophical, but for the sake of newcomers, the answer was to establish a belief before contemplating. Then, what if the result of contemplation is doubt? This requires a doubt about the doubt. Perhaps there is no further doubt? The answer is "perhaps" there is, and there should be. To ask further is to prove oneself unteachable. Thus ended my first lesson in philosophy.</p>
<p>I lack the courage to study a second or third lesson, because if each lesson proves me unteachable, I will discover that everything I know has lost its foundation. It seems better to remain in a life without philosophy. I envy those who, from the beginning, acquire their philosophical basis with religious-like faith, systematically selecting what they need and discarding what they don't. But too much is discarded, which seems to be a common phenomenon. Naturally, this is not a result caused by philosophy itself, but one can and should suspect that starting from philosophy leads to this phenomenon even more.</p>
<p>Planning the re-liberation of education is a promising new effort at present, and its success will be a significant gain for this great era. Experts haven't expressed much opinion yet, but many students have already expressed their hopes in newspapers and magazines. The most common opinion is to criticize the impracticality of secondary school curricula, demanding that choices and rejections be based on ideals. Even some progressive editors misunderstand this view, so the letters answering inquiries strongly emphasize the importance of basic subjects. However, discussing importance and unimportance purely abstractly can be very reasonable from both positive and negative perspectives. For example, most of the knowledge included in geography classes is for reference. This point is quite valuable, but the person who raised this argument may not allow us to doubt whether he can find the necessary geographical knowledge in reference books, or even whether he knows if Tunisia is in Africa or Europe.</p>
<p>The emphasis on memorizing individual events is indeed a shortcoming of current secondary education. However, mathematics, with its abstract nature, is generally disliked by most students. Part of the reason is that mathematics has also been turned into a subject that emphasizes memory over contemplation by educators. But the creation of this situation is also due to scholars' reluctance to apply contemplation in this area. In the past, many believed that middle school students should not contemplate, and that making students pay attention to mathematical methods was the foundation for building useful practical knowledge—a belief that made mathematics the basis of entry. Now, starting from contemplation, we know that building this belief is inevitably biased, and mathematics seems to be abandoned along with this bias. The point that mathematics is a basic tool for philosophical contemplation needs to be emphasized again.</p>
<p>Mathematics has made great contributions to the completion of modern philosophy, but the new idealism of the new Cambridge school, which also starts from mathematics, focuses too much on the contemplative aspects of mathematics. This kind of result is naturally very possible. If the nature of philosophy is contemplation, then this should also be allowed within the scope of philosophy. Moreover, we don't need to anticipate in advance whether we will make such a long-distance leap, using mathematics as a tool for science and as the basis of philosophy. Taking a slight step further towards contemplation is exactly what is needed. The extent to which philosophical contemplation is permissible is not something to ask about for the time being.</p>
<h3>The Grandeur of the Many</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>"Random Thoughts on a Journey, Part 3"</p>
<p>In the Yao Mountains near Yongzhou, I saw many peaks covered from foot to summit with lush green fir trees. They were densely packed together, as if all trying to climb to the mountain peak, stretching out thousands of heads, vying for the sun, and greedily absorbing the atmosphere. This scene made one feel the combination of the many; the more numerous, the more magnificent the beauty.</p>
<p>Similarly, in front of a cave in Guilin, I saw thousands of student soldiers lined up on the plaza below the cave, roaring songs of national salvation. The powerful waves of sound almost shook the wilderness and the sky, also making one feel unparalleled magnificent beauty. Realizing the great power of humanity united in a concerted action is truly astonishing. The same song, when sung by one person, only feels like a song. Conversely, when sung in unison by thousands of throats, one deeply feels that it is simply a force that shakes people.</p>
<p>Previously, when Chinese people went abroad alone to seek a living, they only showed the spirit of struggle and endurance. This time, under the invasion of the × people, the masses united to resist the invaders. I believe it will surely give the world a different and amazing impression. Even if they don't feel this is unparalleled magnificent beauty, they should no longer feel that we Chinese are always a sheet of loose sand! February 16th, Guilin</p>

<h3>The New Tasks of Resistance Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— He Weichu</p>
<p>Literature and art stand at the forefront of the era, illuminating the direction of the times, not following behind it. Before the great anti-aggression war flames were ignited in China, the general themes in Chinese literature and art had already vividly exposed the invaders' ferocity and indicated that China's way out for survival was to engage in a heated and great struggle with the invaders! Now, China has indeed embarked on the sacred and great path of resistance, which can be said to be the literary and art circles having fulfilled part of their responsibility to win a valuable price—the way out for survival. Moreover, this is the task assigned to us by history in this era, and the enlightenment of literature and art standing at the forefront of the era is the same.</p>
<p>Thus, it can be seen that literature and art in the current era of resistance is no longer something for a few literati and cultural figures to appreciate on their own, but has become a guide for the masses and a bugle for the oppressed people. It must reflect not only the heroic deeds of shedding blood and fighting bravely on the battlefield, and the tragic cries of displaced refugees, but also the efforts and struggles of the working masses in the rear who are sweating to help the resistance, as well as the consolidation of private power under the guise of resistance and the reflections of harming the nation's future for private interests, which are also extremely important and necessary. However, it is not only necessary to fulfill the responsibility of reflection, but also to indicate the political line of struggle and the dawn of truth.</p>
<p>Even so, it is still not possible to fully complete the true new tasks in the current era of resistance. It is also necessary to display the glory and greatness of the anti-resistance and to summon the broad masses to the sacred battlefield with unendurable resentment against the invaders, to organize and educate the broad masses to join the circle of the national united front, and to unleash the great power of anti-×.</p>
<p>In short, the new tasks of literature and art in the current era of resistance are not only to reflect the dark side, but also to display the bright side, and the forms of literary and artistic writing can adopt a variety of expressions.</p>
<h3>Execution</h3>
<p>— Shulun</p>
<p>Guarded by soldiers, several dozen yards away from the foothills, a small team escorting a traitor continued to advance. The monotonous trumpet blew ahead, a simple and very low, sorrowful sound that explained the heart's turbulence before the final farewell of someone who no longer needed to exist.</p>
<p>People who had chased out from Zhongshan Road in Sihui County City stood far, far away from the execution ground, looking across as if across a river. At this moment, some people wished they could wear a precise telescope to see everything about the other side clearly. Others didn't care about any of this, cursing dejectedly:</p>
<p>"It would be better to burn him with cigarettes. Shooting him is still too cheap."</p>
<p>"Dismembering him by five horses would be the best! Dealing with those traitors."</p>
<p>There were quite a few people who sympathized with this kind of argument. They could easily exchange the same opinion with each other, rarely using a cruelest method of punishment to pride or overcome others!</p>
<p>So, they said in their hearts:</p>
<p>"It would be much more convenient if we were legislators and law enforcers."</p>
<p>However, other people watched this spectacle with timid hearts. It was the first time in their lives that they had participated in such a grand killing ceremony. Due to their intense hatred of the traitor, their curiosity and courage increased even more.</p>
<p>The timid traitor became even more fearful under the gaze of the crowd. He seemed to be someone who didn't know how to walk. After the first step landed on the ground, he couldn't lift his feet again. Something on the bottom of his feet firmly glued him, and now he hoped that there was really such a thing so that he would no longer have to move.</p>
<p>However, this was impossible. The organized team had already advanced very quickly. Two strong soldiers dragged him forward with all their might, and a large crowd of spectators cheered in an overly noisy voice.</p>
<p>Finally, they arrived at a suitable location. The escort relaxed and stopped him. A soldier in the team stepped forward a few steps to patrol left and right. Then everything seemed to be arranged. The traitor was as fragile as a child and fell to the ground with a push. His head seemed unable to decide whether to look up or down for a moment. His hands and heart were naturally trembling very violently. People closer to him believed that they could see and know that he didn't even dare to hope for the slightest thing.</p>
<p>"Bang!" This sound gave many people a moderate pleasure, and they believed that their hope of coming here had been quite satisfied.</p>
<p>Because the traitor had already fallen to the ground, people longed for the second shot even more.</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang!" There was no commotion in the crowd. At most, they would notify each other or record the number of the dead man's wounds:</p>
<p>"The third, the third shot!"</p>
<p>Presumably, the dead man had already fallen to the ground motionless. People had reached a satisfactory state with this dying man.</p>
<p>An officer-like figure turned the corpse over with one hand, raising his pistol high as if as a sign, and then dispatching it lowly. Thus, the last shot penetrated the back of the criminal.</p>
<p>The traitor was buried on the ground like a clod of earth. The escort team relaxed for a moment, and the guards also returned to the team. Then, the people watching the execution swarmed across the mountain road, even overtaking the people walking slowly in front, running two steps as one to fly forward.</p>
<p>The executed traitor lay straight, his hands tightly bound behind his back with a rope. The bloody wounds were open, red, purple, and bruised black, like a withered rose flowing on his chest, waist, and back.</p>
<p>As before, some people felt a flood of pleasure, while others had weak thoughts surging. Looking at them with pity, they seemed to be thinking:</p>
<p>"I don't feel sorry for the dead man, but why did he have to die like this?"</p>
<p>People gradually dispersed, and the heavy shackles still remained motionless on the traitor's feet.</p>
