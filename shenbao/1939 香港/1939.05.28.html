<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>爭取最後五分鐘　—對於失敗主義的批判</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>自從汪精衛在去年十二月二十九日發表了他的髓豔電，響應日本前內閣首相近衛的聲明，公開主和以後，他的論調早巳經是受了最嚴正的批判的。一月一日中央黨部、永遠開除他的黨籍，幷撤除他的一切職務，這是政府對於他的嚴正的批判。三月二十一日有海外志士五人，在夜間闖進汪在河內的住居，打算為國鋤奸。結果汪雖然得免於死，而由他的秘書曾仲鳴代替了他，這是國民對於他的嚴正的批判。他受了國家上下一致的這樣的批判。我們替汪精衛設想，他假如還留存得有一點國家觀念，他是應該警惕海悟。至少也要做到謹愼絨默才是道理，但他近來却是不顧一切的愈見的倒行逆施起來了。本月初頭，他在香港的他的機關報南華日報上發表了一篇文章叫「舉一個例」為要證明他自己主和有據，他把中央的一種機要文件，加以改竄而擅自發表。對於他這篇文章有吳稚暉先生『對汪精衛「舉一個例」的進一解』駁斥他，可以說是大快人心的事體。四月八號他又發表了一篇「答華僑某君書」，任意的誣蔑我們在前方盜血抗戰的將士，據他說來，好像我們英勇的將士連宋明亡國時的將士都比不上。軍委會政治部日前也針對他這封信，發表了一篇「汪精衛誣陷抗戰官兵的罪惡」沉痛地加以駁斥了。除掉汪精衛自己有這些文章發表之外，他的機關報上還不斷的有許許多多荒謬的言論，而且他的一派更四處活動，淆惑人心，大有非把整個抗戰局勢破壞不可的樣子，這應該是我們全體國民所礙難容忍的。</p>
<p>汪精銜和他一派的主和論據始終是立在近衛的那個所謂「建立果亞新秩序」的聲明上。看他門的言論，他門是始終認為那個東西是十足可靠，眞眞是有點令人不可思議近衛的聲明是在去年十二月二十一日發表的，十二月二十六日我們的最高領袖蔣委員長已經有篇剴切的訓詞，把它駁斥得體無完膚，說它是「×人整個亡我國家，滅我民挨的一切計劃內容的總暴露；是×人整個吞滅中國獨覇東亞，進而企圖征服世界的一切妄想陰謀的總自白』。經過了這樣的駁斥，舉國的人都洞燭了×人的奸計的，王精南却生二十九日還要發表通電未饗應，說也所是出的和平條件並不算亡國的條件。他看見近衛在說不要中國割地，不要中國賠欵，他便為所眩惑了。事實上中國如加入了他的所謂『新秩序』就無異成為了日本的藩屬，而近衛也明白的要求着日本臣民能够在中國的內地自由的居住自由的營業。這就是說中國的土地整個成為了日本的領土，他何必還要讓你割地，更何必還要讓你賠欵呢？汪精衛更眞的相信近衛聲明中所要求的「中國公認日本在特定地點駐兵防共，並將內蒙作為特殊防共區域，」以及『在華北及內蒙各地，關於資源之開發與利用，應予日本以積極的便利』，卽是所謂並非亡國的條件，認為日本所要的只是內蒙華北，而不要華中華南，在華中華南的日本兵可全部撤退，那中國卽使失去一半，也還有一半可以作為小朝廷而偏安，所以說並不算是亡國。汪精衛在艷電中，是在這樣解釋着的，然而在他的艷電發表之後，日本方而早就在報上聲明，說他是「誤解」了。報上的聲明自然還不够，我們還可以把本年正月日本的海陸軍大臣在他們議會中的正式的答辯揭舉出來。</p>
<p>本年一月三十日在衆議院的預算總會上，對於議員北聆吉關于在華駐兵問題的質問，日本的陸相板垣和海相米肉都有明白的答辯。板垣說在中國是有相當長期駐兵的必要的，因此陸軍方面也正在考慮準備半永久性的駐兵的設施，日本兵的衣食住都要取給於中國。又說「自十二月二十二日聲明以後，外面有日本陸軍由華中華南撤兵的傳說，這完全是謠傳，絕無其事』。他還在這句話中加上了『特別鄭重聲明』之類的字樣。米內接着也就稱讚板垣，說日本陸軍不輕視華中華南，是極妥當的話，又說日本海軍對於華中華南即使在事變以後也依然要嚴加警備。以　貢献於『東亞新秩序的建設』的。這可算是明白可靠的證據了吧，這樣明白的答辯，我們相信，汪精衛和他的一派總不會沒有看見，所以近衛的聲明，在我國己由我們的領袖把它駁斥得體無完膚，就在日本本國也由他們的軍部自行戳穿它的騙局，然而汪精衛却仍然還在相信，旣發了竭電之後還要來「舉一個例」，又要來『答某君書』，他在『舉一個例』裏面仍然在說近衛聲明並不苛刻，可以作為談判的基礎，他在「答某君書』裏面更出力的說，只要和的條件不是亡國倏件，我們就應該拿出抗戰的决心與勇氣來講和，他的眞意不用說依然是固執着近衛聲明中的條件不是亡國的條件。再請看他四月九日在南華日報上所發表的『重要聲明』吧。他說，他旣發表了豔電，那嗎以後的一切行動都要根據豔電，前貫澈和平的主張。他又說。他反對日本再以戰事勝利，而變更其覺悟，改變其條件。他對於日本當局甚且還有一個希望，他希望『日本當局。深察事實，推誠磋商，必使中國為一領土主權完整之國家』，眞眞是在做夢。近衛所提出的條件老早不成其為條件的，你還怕他們把它『改變』。我們中華民國堂堂的一個獨立國家，不能够獨立自主，而偏要希望日本當局來『使』我們成為「一個領土主權完整之國家」，這成什麽話　，這不是明明白白的由汪精衛自己把他已經向日本屈膝投降了的心事具體的表白了出來嗎？所以廿八他的一切的一切事實，如汪平沼協定，如派高宗武赴日乞×，如在滬港兩地分頭通×，這些都姑置不論，單就汪精衛自己所公開發表的言論看來，也就足以證明他是存心向日本××了。</p>
<p>投降就投降，在這個地方也儘不妨說一點『老實話』，何必一定要說主和呢？究竟這是有點不大「老實」。</p>
<p>中國並不是好戰的國家，要和我們也覺得任何時間都可以和，但有一個先决條件，就是要×人停止他的侵略，經過我們的長期抗戰，×國的危機是一天一天的顯著了，因而在×國內部也有一部份人覺悟到了他自己本國的危險，希望中送媾和，以消滅他們自已的內憂外患，這是事實，我們也並不否認，不甯是認為這就是中國抗戰以來的偉大的收獲，是我們的抗戰把×國迫近了危機，而生出了求和的願望，但日本內部的求和的願望還沒有形成為具體的力量足以制服目前海睦軍部的主戰派的勢力，這也是明白的事實，不能否認的。就譬如近衛吧，他剛好把和平聲明發表了之後，不久便被過下野。又看本年度的×國的軍事預算吧，那裏有絲毫和平停戰的氣息在裏面？而且最近少壯派的首腦部之一人，小磯，又新入日本內閣，担任拓殖大臣了。這些都證明日本的少壯派主戰依然還維持着他們的統制權，主和的願望是還不足以左右大局的。因此假如我們這時候便來響應×人的誘和，那正是中了×人以華制華，不戰而屈的詭計。這樣的求和，正無異於向日本求降，我想就壘中小學生都可以知道，然而汪精衛和他的一派却始終在那兒執扭地公開的主張，而且公開的活動，這到底是什麼存心呢？</p>
<p>國家對於汪精衛和他的一派似乎不可謂不仁厚了，僅僅開除了汪個人的黨籍而沒有懲處他的黨羽，僅僅撤去了汪個人的職務，而沒有下他的通緝。×人的陸上戰門力是已經削弱了，財政已瀕於破產，海上又四面都是强×，連建艦競爭都使他喘不過氣。×人在高呼着『國難嚴重』在高呼着『國難已經到了最緊急的關頭』，那些是實情，並不是他們的危辭　聽。所以目前我們正應該加緊我們的反攻力量，以圖達到我們的勝利的前途。我們是應該爭取最後五分鐘的時候，我們怎好在這時候來鬆氣？汪精衛是絕頂聰明的人，我不相信他連這一點　見不到，目前也是他自己爭取最後五分鐘的時候了，希望他要體貼國家待他的仁厚，要念到孫總理締造民國的艱難，要念到五千年綿延不斷的國脈之可寳貴，不要倒行逆施到底。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從廿八年五月廿一日至廿七日</p>
<p>戰鬥的革命的五月，己到最後一週。</p>
<p>這一週間的時事，充分表現出兩條戰綫之鬥爭的日趨劇烈。侵略國家方面；德意兩國已經揭去「防共」的烟幕，宣佈準備進攻民主國家的軍事同盟，而東方××的日本，則從上海，北至天津南至本港海面，都已向英美法各民立國家的權益作××的××！民主和平國家方面的團結，目前又有新的進步，主要的是英蘇互助協定，已由英法方面的通訊社偉出業已成立的消息。不過實際上還有許多缺點，需要繼續努力，因為世界大戰的危機，還正在日益接近全面爆發的終點。</p>
<p>中國的抗日戰爭，本週內沒有重大變化。貝於我們的堅持團結緊持抗戰，已經激起國際上更大的同情，國聯巳經確定我國為被侵略國而乎籲各會員國的援助，而我國內部的軍事政治亦在日日進步中，不過日×和漢奸的政治的進攻；則有更毒辣的更毒的酷的規表，我們要提高警惕性，我們要給他加倍的打擊！</p>
<p>（一）德意簽訂軍事同盟</p>
<p>喧傳已久的德意軍事同盟，已於五月仕二日由德外畏里賓特羅甫和意外長齊亞諾在柏林簽署成立，協定計有三條：（一）兩國對於（甲）一切有關各該國利益的問題，或（乙）歐洲的全般局勢，務須互相永遠保持密切的接觸，達到雙方同意；（二）倘因國際局勢而影響及兩國共同利益時，兩國須共同協議，加以保護；（三）如兩國中之一國的安全及其他重要權利被外力威脅時，其他一國卽應於政治及外交上給以全力的協助，如兩國之一受其他一個或一個以上的强國威脅而有牽入戰爭危險，卽應以全部海陸空軍力量進行　助。此外附帶條款：（一）德意兩國將於東事上及戰時經濟上加緊合作，（二）兩國為執行上述第一第二兩條，應設一永久委員會，受兩國外交部長指揮。（三）倘遇戰時，須兩國完全同意，始能停戰。（四）兩國須極力保持的共同友邦的友誼，最著者為日本，「滿洲國」及匈牙利。（五）本約有效期間為十年。</p>
<p>自從『防共協定』成立以來，一切瘋狂挑戰倂吞弱小的事實都會證明德意日三個侵略國家。早已成立軍事同盟，現在不過為想在反侵略陣綫尚未鞏固與擴大之際，向英法肆行恫嚇，才敢於撤去無恥的防共煙幕，而正式宣佈這一軍事同盟的成立而已！同時，亦因歐洲若干『中間國家』的被併吞已經不能滿足侵略者的慾望，而法國以至英國本土，亦將立卽成為侵略的目標了！至於日本，為了參加德意軍事同盟問題、在本遁內曾經鬧得滿天星火。據廿五日美聯社東京電，還說日本駐德意大使大島和白鳥為了當局沒有參加而突然提出辭職，外相有田甚至卽將引退！但要知道日本廣大人民和有識人士原都反對參加德意防共協定的，由於侵華的危機與困難的嚴重，日本內部的傾軋矛盾亦必更趨劇烈，但是日×當局目前不卽參加，還有其政治上誘脅英法美各國的陰謀，如果只看見日本沒有參加就以為歐美列强的遠東權益便有保障。或因此認為日本侵略者尙有和平之心，便是極大的錯誤！</p>
<p>（二）遠東海上風雲險惡</p>
<p>即從本週內發生在遠東海上的事件來看，亦可證明上述估計的相當接近事實。日×一面保留參加德意軍事同盟的時間，甚至還發表些决不參加的不値信任的談話，一面則正在開始大規模對英美法各國的進攻，準備去奪他們全部在遠東的地位與權益。表現在具體事實上的。主要的是（一）　浪嶼登陸事件，日方態度竟更加橫靈無理，並且於廿五日起悍實行封鎖，斷絕鼓厦交通；（二）却奪租界事件，壓迫上海租界的形勢旣然繼續嚴重，而據廿六日天津外訊，則日方刦奪天津租界的陰謀又在積極策動了；（三）此外，日×還在本週由海軍方面宣佈全面封鎖我國沿海，實行搜檢一切外國船舶，而在廿四日就有英商鐵行郵船公司蘭浦拉號在香港一哩海面之突遭襲擊，和法郵亞林美士號在距香港十七哩海面之橫遭非法搜査！</p>
<p>日×此種××行為，其最大目的在於刧奪英法美在華地位與權益，在於强化其中國佔領地區的統治，劫掠，與壓榨：以解救其困難和準備征服全中國進一步獨覇遠東。日×之所以胆敢在其國際形勢日益惡劣孤立之際，而作出此種橫蠻行動，則完全因於德意軍事同盟成立後，英法各國妄圖日本不參加，妄圖不卽與日×對立起來，因此，在上週對鼓浪嶼事件一度由英法美三國聯合向日示威之後，不僅不繼之以堅决的和進一步的有效辦法，反而自甘退處被動與劣敗地位，以與日×進行會談；使日×得於驚懼之餘，獲得意外的便宜，由劣敗地位轉得主動優勢，就在伯明罕艦的四國談話之際大肆縣詐×行了！此外，如上海租界之甘為日×役使，逼令譯報導報大美中美等援華各報停刊，任意接受汪派××與日×××的意見而搜査各書店，逮捕前進的報人胡仲持先生等，所有這些××退議，都是授日×以刃柄而自甘犧牲的辦法！伯明罕緩四國會議之無結果，本在意中，而我們所憂慮的是英法等國對於日×如仍一貫此種態度到底，則更大的威脅，恐怕就在眼前呢！</p>
<p>（三）英蘇互助談判實況</p>
<p>正在東西兩方的戰雲又趨高漲之時，英法兩國的通訊社傳出了英蘇互助談判進步的消息，有幾家電訊社和報紙，並已援用『英法蘇協定成立後』等等字樣了，事實上又是怎樣呢？？英蘇談判進步原是事實，這從上週的消息卽可證實，尤其是經過一週來英法雙方的反覆談商以後，更繼之於本週內英國內閣的會商，英國當局的態度，確比以前不同了。到了本月廿六日，法外長龐萊己將英法聯合建議案的最後草稿，交給蘇聯大使蘇利資，並請從速答覆。以便英法蘇三國互助協定得以早日公佈。據傳這新建議的內容大致是：（一）互助協定將在英蘇法三國在歐洲領土遭過侵略時發生效力。但在正式協定尙未成立前，將由三國聯合宣言，聲明共同應付此種威脅，（二）舉凡受三國保證的任何國家領土遭受直接侵略時，三國應共同會商及决定行動，關於何國應受保證一卽，仍待討論决定。同時任何被侵略國家也須先行抵抗然後始可亨受保證的效力。（三）三國將召開參謀部會議，以期三國間海陸空軍獲致最高效率的合作。這個建議案大致上確巳和蘇聯所提互助協定的原則較為接近，證明反法西斯反侵略的民主和平陣線確已大有進步了！但是這個新建議案依然存在極大的也可以說是根本的缺陷，第一就是沒有包括遠東在內，倫敦人士宣稱，如果日本參加德意軍事同盟，則英法蘇互助協定當卽擴大遠東，意思是目前還不需要組織遠東反侵略陣線，其中當然不應看漏了英法財政資本當局××蘇聯與中國勢力擴大的心理，但是目前日×在還東對英法地位權益的加進攻，不正可以說明此種心理之卽應滌漲了嗎？第二，這個新建議還是『半截性』的，想先用共同宣言來把德意軍事同盟鎭壓一下，然後再進行正式簽訂互助協定與舉行三國參謀部會議的談判，這種迂緩的鬆弛的步驟，當然還不足以眞正制裁侵略者，不足以切實拯救民主與和平的。不過我們也不必過分杞憂。國際環境的需要，英法民衆和多數有識當局的要求，和蘇聯反法西斯反侵略的和平政策在國際信譽的提高，和影響的擴大，中國團結抗戰的堅持和進展，所有這些都將在逼使英蘇法互助協定正式成立和反侵略陣綫擴至遠東的迅速實現！</p>
<p>（四）蘇聯首次議會開幕</p>
<p>一九三九年第一次的蘇維埃聯邦議會，已於廿五日晚在克林姆宮開會，出席代表達一千六百人，代表參加蘇維埃社會主義聯邦的一百多個民族。在此舊世界，濔漫了新大戰的砲火之際，社會主義新世界這個盛大的議會，自將為全世界人士目光所集中，而為一切和平正義人士廣大被壓迫大衆所祝望，這次議會將延續一星期或十天，討論的主題是外交，國防和發展國民經濟的第三個五年計劃。關於這些，在三月十日至廿一日的十八屆聯共大會上已有重大的决定，獲得了全聯那的擁護以至全世界的重視。這次議會則將由來自各地的一千六百代表共同决議具體的辦法，而進行發展蘇聯國力，增加國際信譽，保衛世界和平和實現援助被壓迫被侵略民族的解放運動。當財政人民委員長齊維諾夫在議會宣佈一九三九年軍事費為四百萬萬盧布，約佔全國預算總數四分之一時，出席代表歡呼達九分鐘之久！齊氏還說，蘇聯海陸軍現經準備以三倍的實力，還答戰爭商人的襲擊！我們從這裏可以看到蘇聯內外政策順利執行的保證。</p>
<p>蘇聯國力的强大，和我國團結抗戰的進展，同樣吿訴全世界：中蘇兩大國家及其今日之勢力，已經成為雄護世界和平維護民主政治維護人類文化的中堅力力量了！反法西斯反侵略運動如果要求切實成功，就絲毫不能勉强地要運重中蘇兩國的利益而興中蘇兩國實現平等互助的合作，不過今日要求實現這一點，首先還在中蘇兩國更現密的合作，進而鼓勵英美法各國對華友誼的增進。</p>
<p>（五）國聯決議援華制日</p>
<p>國際聯盟的信譽，雖已因主要會員國英法兩國在去年慕尼黑會議中的××××××××而更加降落，但是它畢竟還是目前國際上唯一以維議世界和平為目的的最高機構，除了法西斯侵略者以外，都不願見其毀壞而都期望其振作盡責的。因此，當本週內國聯開會之時，我國代表顧維鈞博士，於廿二日以動人的辭令，向國際行政院提出兩項要求：第一，通吿會員國家擴大其對華財政的及物質的援助，以增强其抵抗侵略實力及救濟難民工作，避免一切足以削弱中國抵抗侵略的行為，中止以作戰工具及原料供給日本，尤其是飛機與汽油。並限制日本貨品之輪入。第二，組成一團體，以聯合推進上述各步驟。廿四日下午，國聯行政院舉行秘密會議，討論决議案。起草委員會對我國要求所提出的要點是：（一）各會員國應採取一切可能及有效辦法，援助中國抗戰。（二）現有數會員國對遠東問題已能採取一致行動，行政院認為滿意，（三）行政院對某某數國的援華步驟，表示慰；（四）希望各國仍能繼續援華，並能增加援華的稈度；（五）請各會員國駐遠東領事館，研究各國採取援華步驟的實際效用。據廿六日日內瓦電，國聯行政院將於廿七日閉幕，將宣佈中國被侵略國，而通吿各會員國加强個別援華。大約國聯今日所能為力者仍止於此，雖然這是不能不使我們感覺遺憾的，但是我們也可以依據國聯這種决定，依據顧代表提出的要求，加緊國民外交工作，力促民主和平各國援華制日運動的進展：國聯的决議，自將更有利於我國這種爭取外援的活動了。</p>
<p>六　抗日戰爭一週情勢</p>
<p>最後，一週來的抗日戰爭，雖然在各戰場都沒有重大的變化，但是也有幾個特點，値得報吿的：</p>
<p>第一，整個戰局陳誠將軍於廿二日在重慶招待中外記者曾有明白報吿，他說『我們不希望在今年或明年獲勝，但　續戰三五年，我們必獲最後勝利。』他說『目前日本不僅不能續得任何進步，而且在其佔領區內為華軍所困，日軍陣綫後方區域，除游擊隊興流動隊不計外，尙有中國正規軍六十師之多』陳將軍最後明白指出極關重要的一點，他說『中國最惡劣的時期現已過去！嚴溝事事變之初，是中國最危念的時候，因為當時和戰意見紛歧，民族危機最重，其次在南京淪陷之後，中國在此一役確曾遭受慘烈攡。但是日軍在南京與漢。雨役中未使我軍受决定的敗績，現在此種機會是永遠不會再來了！』</p>
<p>第二，×軍分佈現在日×在華部隊，據陳誠將軍報吿，現有步兵三十個師團，騎兵三旅團，分佈如下：廣東與海南島共三師，京滬　鐵路沿綫與皖南共三師，贛湘鄂邊共五師，襄樊以東三帥，另騎兵一旅，皖北與平漢路共兩師，蘇化與津浦路沿綫共四師，冀察共三師半，豫東與道淸路區共兩師，晉省行師，晉綏邊共兩師。這種兵力，由於我們×後戰鬥的日趨發展，運動己感極大困難，進攻的力量自然更是有眼了。</p>
<p>第三，各線戰况（一）鄂北方面，×軍集中步兵三師騎兵一旅，企圖包圍湯恩伯部，但在棗陽以北鑒戰三晝夜後，×軍包圍計劃已遭粉碎，現在新野駐有孫連仲劉汝明兩部，大洪山駐有劉和鼎一軍團，本週內至廿六日止，浙河安陸，大洪山，廣城，天門，京山。鍾祥一帶激戰，續又殲×二千餘人，×已不能向襄樊　展了，（二）鄂湘贛邊戰事尤其是洞庭湖方面，本週內又激烈，但因陳誠將軍所指揮的南昌方面的連獲勝利而使×遭受創傷，我們反攻高安南員，更加阻止×軍包圍湘鄂邊境我軍的計劃。卽以湘北而言，×於廿四五日全力進犯，卽曾被我殲殺千餘。（三）粵省我軍則已完成各棹部署，候機反攻，全省游擊戰爭，亦在省當局積極計劃與領導下，日有進展，（四）江南戰場，自月初金華會議以後，我軍反攻續有勝利，一部已經克復桐鄉，另有錢唐江南一部。則已再度渡江反攻杭州，（五）華北方面，晉冀戰事續有進展，山東方面連日反攻濟南，並曾一度衝入，</p>
<p>第三，日×困難日×目前困難是日益嚴重，，除了國際形勢，已如前述以外，軍事上則益感兵力不足，交通險阻，地形不利，用兵困難和後方的空虛，經濟上則財政貧困，生產降低，對外貿易與衰落，和國民生機重絕，以至日圓價格的一再傾跌，政治上則國內反戰情緒高、軍閥財閱與中小資產者及平民的矛盾愈大，統治階級，各種政策的矛盾衝突，所有這些都在日益暴露日本××在她野蟹的退步的戰爭當中所有困難的發展。</p>
<p>第四，日×漢好陰謀更為嚴重的是日×這種困難事實上靠日本力量是不能克服的。因此他們最近便極力想用中國土地、人口生產、來解救他們日益嚴重的危機。他們使以政治進攻配合軍事進攻的來實現這種新計劃，首先是加强反共與和平的宣傳，以離間我內部的團結（進而阻止國民總動員）阻止我政治進步推（阻止民主政治與改善民生）削弱我持久抗戰的力量；接着是加緊排斥歐美列强，刦奪各地租界，統制沿海航運，更接着大舉轟炸重慶及策動襄樊與湘鄂戰事，以鞏固及打通平漢粵漢兩路以東的佔領區，最後則利用汪精衛等積極籌組偽中央黨政機關，企圖强化佔領地區統治，刦掠與腰榨的準備進一步征服全中國和獨霸遠東。這種新陰謀本週內是史加明顯了。這裏應該重複昨日本報社評的結語：『從這裏已經可以明瞭，我們今日發展被佔地區×人後方戰鬥的重要了！我們今日加緊打擊反共和平謬論和打擊一切漢奸傀儡與汪等主動的偽中央的重要了！我們更應明瞭今日加緊全國團結加緊全民動員和推動政治進步的重要了！</p>
<h3>西綫十戰士</h3>
<p>— 晉東南特約通訊　狄平</p>
<p>城內騷亂的像滾了鍋，各商家急忙掩住門，老百姓也不敢走路，動也不敢動，爬在小巷裏。</p>
<p>城皇廟裏的七十多個侵略者的部隊，一齊慌了脚，抬出機關槍照若南門和城牆　橫掃射起來，其餘的人馬，都向北門集合，打算想向北逃竄。</p>
<p>三個戰士的炸彈完了，一個受了傷，不敢逗留，跳下城腦股勁向南跑，當然是檢着小路，有時還滾在水溝裏。</p>
<p>城內的槍放够了，各處偵察遍了，城內並沒有游擊隊，對老百姓是剝了所有的衣服在檢査看，直到旁晚時候，城內還充滿着恐怖的空氣。</p>
<p>晚上侵略者們更是提心掉膽地戒備着。</p>
<p>六，老百姓學乖巧</p>
<p>游擊隊乖巧，老百姓也跟着學得乖巧了。</p>
<p>距鐵路不到二十里的地方，就是警戒線，同時也就是游擊戰區。</p>
<p>一天晚上，絲毫沒有月光，夜像漆一般的黑從東西，南北，各村莊裏走出了幾個年靑的莊稼人，背着幾個空空的煤油筒，樓着幾個磨包，悄悄地走進黑暗的原野。</p>
<p>他們在駐紮着侵略者的軍隊的一個村莊；莊外田隴間的小灣腰樹上，和基田稠密的小柏樹林裏，掛上了煤油桶，把成捆的鞭砲，火藥，裝在裏面，按上長短不相等的花稔子，又撕開長串的火鞭，分掛在各要路口枯萵上。</p>
<p>工作完畢後東西村的人，又在一個的定的小浮溝裏相會，抽了幾袋旱烟，分散回家去睡覺了。</p>
<p>半夜裏，萬籟無聲，稠密的繁星在亂睞着眼睛，黝黑的原對上藏着幽默和神秘。</p>
<p>東面：乓！乓兵乓……</p>
<p>西面：乓！乓乓兵……</p>
<p>南面，北面，各路口都響起來。</p>
<p>柏樹林裏；轟！聶！</p>
<p>怎麼固圍盡是槍聲呢？</p>
<p>向來不站崗不守衛的侵略者，慌的像驚槍的兔子，崛田的褲子錯穿在來本正什一的腿上。</p>
<p>全村都騷亂了，侵略者的部隊在慌張急燥，不知道究竟是怎麼一會事，機關槍急忙架起來，拉砲的大馬也塞在轅子里，所有的輜重鄱裝上了卡車。</p>
<p>長官下了命令，黑夜裏拚死抵抗，等到天明再乘機拉出去。</p>
<p>村外的鞭砲，斷斷續續地響上，甚而越譽越近，於是架在村口的機關槍，就抨命的叫起還鄉得像一陣狂風。外面炮聲沒有斷過，所以機關槍一直天明。其實打了一夜，到。甚麼影子也沒有見着，還不到東方發白，野外砲聲一響也沒有了。</p>
<p>又到天黑的時候，還是那幾個莊稼漢去收囘了煤油，桶，把各的砲紙灰掃了一掃。</p>
<p>一場游戲算完畢了附近各村的男女老幼都在談這場激烈的游戲戰爭。</p>
<p>至於那被佔領的村莊的，民，更是為這埸游戲而歡笑。　（完）</p>

<h3>記中山德泰（下）</h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>日本反戰軍人之先覺者</p>
<p>大約是四月中旬，楊大隊長派人護送中山君去看樊崧甫將軍。樊將軍這時已開始指揮所部，由贛湘北部進入武昌，咸寗，陽新的三角地區，隨時隨地攻擊日軍的側背。他們步行了八天，終於在修水通山間的叢山密集中會見了樊。樊部的參謀長李潘侯和參謀雷震——日本大學學生，對他招待得很週到，他非常感激。</p>
<p>他又從小包袱中拿出一疊題字，翻出兩張遞給我。他微笑着又用鉛筆在拍紙簿上寫道：「樊崧甫將軍請我喝酒以後，寫給我。」第一張上面寫着：</p>
<p>「巍巍宇宙，渺渺山河。爭城奪地，人壽幾何？！</p>
<p>宜爾室家，樂爾妻拏。優哉遊哉，以保天和。</p>
<p>中山難友，古括樊崧甫贈」</p>
<p>另一張是保安第四團團長贈給他的，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「明白×性的侵略，是為智；不為盲目的戰爭，是為仁；毅然離開家國，是為勇。朋友，你是和平之神的先導者，日本國民的知先覺者，我們有無限的欽敬心。從今以後，共相努力，使日閥能早日覺悟，改其野心。則厥功惟首。」</p>
<p>我問起他對於中日戰爭的感想，也說：「上月，我在樊崧東將軍司令部裏，曾用日文寫了一段「感想記」，伹只有識日文的人才能了解。那夜我又在月光下用我粗淺的中文譯寫起來，不過，總覺得詢不達意。」</p>
<p>「感想記」用毛筆草率地寫在毛邊上——</p>
<p>「今日中日二國戰事是夢想——卽日本資本主義的大陸政策實現也。彼等政府以美義的字「忠君愛國」的偽宣傳利用國民。侵略的戰爭開始，是我們兄弟徒去送死的盲目政策也。軍部資本家吿訴我們說：「我們國民生活保證卽東洋和平」，但我們同志所經驗的却完全相反。若是眞正要求東洋和平，用這樣亂殺的辦法做得到嗎？我們做了侵略者的走狗，就是戰死了，和平也不會實現。軍部的高官們得了金動章，洋洋得意；財閥們因為戰爭獲利，腰包裝得滿滿。我們這時所謂「尊貴的犧牲者」却白白地送了性命，我們同志，為國家，為家眷，為開放自己本身，非把暴戾的軍部財閱打倒不可。團結起來，發動反對侵略的運動。」——四月廿二日。</p>
<p>問起他的軍中生活，據說是比他初來中國時差多了。他的月餉是一百八十日元。在中國花用必先向軍中換取軍用手票。這樣，等於重又把餉銀還給軍部財閥。所苦的，只是佔領區事的中國老百姓，他們用血汁得來物產，換到的只是些不兌現的軍用手票。在佔領區裏，一個聯隊畏也竟可以發行紙幣，用任何紙張油印一下，蓋上一顆私章，就强迫中國人民佼用。這是世界上任何國家都想不出來的，日本軍閥們却這樣做了，他在中國作戰約八個月，積聚了一千六百二十五日元的貯金，已在他逃亡以前，匯寄給他的老母了。</p>
<p>因為他是參謀部的見習士官，所以對於鄂南湘北的日軍情形，知道得非常淸楚。他對長官部參謀處做了長約五萬字的報吿。（記者曾獲先覩，因為事關軍事秘密，暫時不能發表。）中山君對於我國破壞公路阻碍日軍行進，認為已漸成功，他以為中國正規軍隊應該盡可能深入日軍的陳後；中國的閒諜應該和日軍佔領區的各種偽組織發生更密切的關係，從事偵察敵情，協助國軍的工作。他又說：「日軍士兵的反戰，巳將由思想的步入行動的了。我希望能在作戰中去組織他們。中國不論在軍事上，政治上，經濟上，離戰勝日本之期，已經不遠。」</p>
<p>握別時，記者吿訴他，他也許不日就可以到桂林後方去休息一個時候。他問：「從長沙到桂林有多少路？」他很欣喜有汽車和火車可以代步。因為他足部生瘡，不良於行。</p>
<p>長沙的新聞界準備在日內召集在長的文化界，對中山泰德君之來師舉行一次大的歡迎會。五，一五，在長沙。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>粵省調整稅務</h3>
<p>報載粵省為適應目前需要，正在努力於全省稅務調整，分別擬定戰時稅則，而置具重心於「增益軍儲，培養民力，兼籌並顧」。這是非常　得注意的一件事。</p>
<p>自　去年十月，日×開始大舉進犯華南以後，向爲粵省稅牧大宗的廣州一帶的稅捐，卽吿斷絕，而中區及海南各處，又相繼淪為戰區，稅收亦多停頓。再加粵省現行稅則都　戰前所訂，自與目前時勢與環境的需要，有未盡適合之處。這種修改自屬十分必要。</p>
<p>至於「增益軍備與培養民力兼籌並顧」的原則，亦與抗戰建國綱領相符。不過在具體條例和執行辦法上，我們認爲尙須注意兩點，即第一，在新稅條例方面，應該絕對遵依抗戰建國綱領，並參照國民參政會三屆大會的决議，一面增加遺產稅及切實執行以累進法課所得稅，一面不忘扶植生產建設事業，以增加新稅源。而尤爲重要的則是儘量廢除殘餘的苛捐雜稅，减輕農工商人的負担，以淸除稅收的障碍。第二在執行辦法方面，要切實淸除殘除的貪汚份子及一切陋規積弊，提倡不辭限苦廉潔奉公的作風，儘量擢拔力量有作爲有操守的靑年人才。而『有錢出鐵，共救國難』的宣傳解釋工作，亦應配合進行。</p>
<h3>泰縣孩子大隊</h3>
<p>抗戰以來，中國兒童與少年，亦多在×人的砲火洗禮下面壯大起來，担負起抗日救亡的艱舌工作，爲抗戰建國而努力，其中如上　童子軍上兒童劇團，新安旅　團，及華北各戰地的少年先鋒隊，兒童服務團等的功績，尤爲舉國所稱譽。</p>
<p>昨目報載江蘇泰縣孩子大隊，爲擴展孩子組織，動員全縣孩子，參加抗戰工作，曾於本月十日召集各學校　私塾兒童舉行第一次座談會，當時决定了每週舉行　會，發表全縣兒童聯合宣言，及推展歌詠運動等。我們對於在　軍後方地區的兒童這種愛國的精神與努力，大家平心想想，能不面紅慚愧否？</p>
<p>我們日與孩子爲伴侶的小學敎師們，看到各地兒童的參加抗戰建國工作，××××××××！我們不能親自到前方和淪陷區去工作，也應該關心關心我們那些未來主人翁的學生和家庭兒童的生活吧！叔棣</p>
<h3>世界的命運與遠東前途</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>【倫敦通訊】自從德、日、意侵略集團締結以來的三年中、尤其是自從中國開始抗後了的兩年中、實際上、我們不妨籠統地總結一句、世界命運和遠東前途所進行的方向、大體上、是一貫的、是毫無變更的、這其中、唯一可能改變它們方向、唯一企圓另　歷史的事件、是什麽呢、毫無疑義的、是去年春天以來、正式出現在世界舞台上的英國現任「張伯倫內閣」的「路線」、然而、這個路線、到本年年初、張伯倫首相發表他的著名的「伯明罕演說」的前夜、是已經完全宣吿失收了、接着、當英國政府决意和蘇聯開始談判的時候、英團現任內閣、算是兜了一個大大的圈子、然而、却又囘返到原來的出發地、最有趣的、是這一批主持兜圈子的人物、自始至終、並沒有什麽變換、而令我們感到難受的、是想到做了他們犧牲品的一大串的弱小民族和國家、奧國、捷克，西班牙、阿爾尼巴亞、所以英國政府掉轉頭來，向東歐、南歐等小國紛紛地、提出保證它們獨立的諾言時、這、就是在說、現在起、英國的外交、已經囘到一年以前的出發點、向正當的途程上、從新出發、</p>
<p>這一個第二度的出發、是不是會再走到歧途上去，這，一直到現在、我們還不敢肯定地說，然而另有一點、我們却是可以肯定地預料的、第一度如果是毫無牧穫祇有犧牲的話、那末、縱使再來個第二度、其結果當然的也一定是一個全然的失敗、所不同的是、萬一不幸眞有一個第二度、那末，那犧牲較之第一次、要大得多、而這次以後、是不是還會有機會議英國再回到原出發點去從新試探、却大成問題的了，總結這一年來的演變過程、卽使在現在、我們已經不妨這麽說了、蘇聯和美國的堅定、再加上我們中國的偉大鬥爭、這三點、是一年來支持全世界總形勢最大的支柱，因而直到今天、英、法還有機會、再囘來另關途徑、挽囘它們帝國的命運，</p>
<p>依目前世界總形勢說來、第一件大事、是：</p>
<p>（一）英、蘇間目前正在進行着的合作談判、</p>
<p>首先、是這一個合作的基礎的問題、號稱爲英、蘇間對立的這件事、這些年來、早已成爲常識了、現在要是提到合作，那末、什麽是它的基礎呢、第一、蘇聯放棄了「世界革命」的路線以來、社會制度的變革、大體上已經成爲各國的內政，第二、英國的干涉蘇聯社會革命失敗後、不獨是對於蘇聯、卽使對於她本國的社會主義的傾向和政黨，也早已取了開明的政策、第三，傻略集團德、日、意三國所提出的威脅、對于英、蘇是共同的、</p>
<p>適應着這個基礎、那末，在『反侵略　線」或「和平陳線」這一類的形式下、英、蘇間的合作、是可以建立起來的、</p>
<p>不過、除此而外、有一個也是非常重要的一點、那就是、英、蘇兩方在主觀上的覺悟和决心、這裏面、在目前、有一個最重要的分歧、就是、英國爲了保持它目前的帝國內容和範圍、它在利用着任何方法、避免作戰、至於蘇俄方面、這些年來、它一貫的外交政策、是避免挑起法西斯集團反共十字軍的組成、可是、在另一面、爲了澈底消除對於唯一社會主義國家的威脅、它是在隨時隨地地、準備和任何大規模的國際反侵略集團、携起手來、共同作戰、雖然英、蘇成立協定、也不一定就會發生戰事、然而、在它未成立以前英、蘇之閒、作爲大前提的、無論如何、要有着這樣一個最低限度的諒解、合作的終極目的、在於維持和平、然而。遇到和乎手段裁制無效時、彼此要有不惜一戰的自動决心、從運引伸下去、必然的推論是、（一）英國放棄拆散德、日、意集團的幻想、及（二）放棄以犧牲弱小民族國家爲滿足侵略國、避免大戰的唯一秘訣、並且、（三）這一合作抵抗的精神，要　底普及於全世界、</p>
<p>上面所述的這個根本的覺倍、在英國目前情况下、是並沒有成熟的、不過、那大的趨向、確實的、是在走向者成熟之途、</p>

<p>補助軍費五十萬元</p>
<p>至于支出方面、本年四月份之各項支銷中、以陸軍補助費一項至爲巨大、蓋英國軍事當局、年來積極增强香港軍事防衛、因此港府負祖軍費亦逐漸增多、本年四月份港府支出陸軍補助費總數達五十萬元、同時又因本港處于非常時期、警察費用支出亦比平常時期增加、本年四月份支出共二十九萬一八千九百一十一元五角四分、其他各項、計恩倖支出二十五萬三千七百二十三元二角一分、敎育著支出一萬四千五百一十一元四角九分、醫務局支出二十一萬七千一百八十一元一角八分、工務局支出一十三萬九千八百四十三元六角九分、以上數目、均比去年同期增加、統計由一月至四月止、各項支出練數已佔一九三九年支出預算總數百分之三十云</p>

<h3>「中救」最精練的代表作　『逃難到香港』觀感</h3>
<p>別流淚，拿出力量來　奇卓</p>
<p>因爲抗戰高於一切，所以一切服從抗戰。戲劇，亦就作爲宣傳民衆，敎育民衆最有效果的文化部門了。</p>
<p>瞧—前線，農村，何處沒有抗戰劇團的足跡—瞧！抗戰劇本的產生，豈不是像雨後春筍一般蓬勃—這中間，不知道鼓舞舞多少將士，感動了多少同胞—而最流利，最普遍，最有意趣，收效亦最大的是那一齣戲呢？不消說，當然首推「放下你的鞭子」。因爲這是「用舊形式表現新內容」最成功的作品；在街頭演出，特別適合廣大的羣衆。</p>
<p>「中救」長征南北二十個月，公演了七百四十一次：「放下你的鞭子」，就是演出次數最多，技術上最精練的得意代表作。前天晚上，該團在利舞台義演「保衛祖國」第　幕的　逃難到香港來」就是將「放下你的鞭子」改編來的。記者雖因事阻未及參觀前三幕，但是，預算將演至『逃難到香港」的時候　不得不擱置其他的事，急急忙忙地趕往參觀。</p>
<p>吿訴讀者：記者觀後不僅不曾失望，而且感覺到意外的牧獲。</p>
<p>幕開，就是玩把戲的場面。金山飾張三，衣衫襤褸鬚髮全白，一言一動，妙肖一個可憐的老頭。王瑩飾香姐，煞像民間嬌美的少女。</p>
<p>范政頭上　了一把紅辮子，亦變成小夥計了。</p>
<p>鑼鼓一響，一呼一應：有輕有重，節奏和諧，他們三人的本事眞大，我們眞如在看把戲一樣。原來：香姐跟她的父親張三老頭是北方人，種田過活，倒還安逸。不料×人的　手伸了過來，香姐的老母被殺了—家亦破產了。父女二人，相依爲命，流亡出來。隨身帶着的幾個錢早用光了。舉目無親，只得在　頭賣藝糊口，好在香姐天資聰　，理她的技藝，　泊各地，倒亦能號召些觀衆，每天的收入，勉强還能維持父女和小夥計的生活。這奔波的日子最近更從內地飄流到香港來了。生活的風霜，只便他們感覺到憔悴乏力。</p>
<p>這一天，正在街頭献技，香姐繼　老頭及小　計表演了很多技藝之後，因爲無力支持，歌不成聲，且多次跌倒下去。張老頭爲生計攸關，便將香姐痛施鞭打，觀衆哀憐這樣一個嬌弱的女子，都憤憤不平。大喊放下你的鞭子。有二個爽直的靑年，激於義俠，更出而干預。香姐見老父觸動公怒，遂向觀衆詳爲解釋。靑年旣明眞象，反悔恨自己燥切，遂向他們父女安慰一番。——這是劇情發展的一個槪要，老頭掉了牙齒，化裝得很像：說話像洩了氣一樣，在緊張處吐口沬的表演以及「話又得說回來」的語氣　簡直是一摸一樣的賣藝老頭。小夥計把汪精衛駡了一頓的說白及鼓詞，千變萬化，妙趣叢生。觀衆大喊「再來一個」—「再來一個」—空氣極度緊張。</p>
<p>香姐唱動人的砍曲，由老頭拉弦子。無論是表淸，聲音，歌詞，台步，可謂是登峯造極—會場視線集中，掌聲一一陣一陣雷鳴起來。空氣又緊張，又熱烈。是一個不可多得的游藝大會，亦是一個宣傳抗戰的演講會。「別流淚，拿出力量來」。又莊又諧，旣　肅，又活潑。及至老頭更打香姐時，觸動公憤，更充分表現着同情心。</p>
<p>這三個角色，多材多藝，完全是玩把戲的賣　者了。與平日所見的金山，王瑩，范政，完全不同，記者因他們三人淪落到這樣的地步，爲竟一掬同情之淚，眞的忘記他們是演戲。其實，這又何嘗不是我們中國人其共的遭遇？「中救」的演技，要是沒有高度的熱情與實生活的體驗，一定不會有這設偉大的成功。因此，記者聯想到他們在商城演戲勞軍的故事了：「弟兄們都整齊地坐在地上，戲演到一半，天忽然陰雨着了。越下越大，當時，我們（中救）和該師官長商議，爲了免兄弟們淋雨，願意明天走三十里路，到兵營裏去重演，當官長站在高地上問：「救亡劇團同志們怕我們淋雨，願明天到我們兵營裏重演，現在回去不回去」？「不囘去！」這是弟兄們洪亮地囘答。「我們看下去」—又是第二次洪亮的喊聲。」</p>
<p>又，最近他們在韶關演劇　軍時，感動了全體的官兵。張發奎將軍竟親自指揮全體士兵向中救全體團員見禮。——原來他們感動軍民的戲劇，就在我們的眼前了。記者於深受感動之下，除向中救朋友表示敬意外，亟應向讀者作個忠實的報道！『保衛祖國』的第四幕就是「逃難到香港來」。今天上下午在利舞台公演招待學生及市民。參觀去吧，你會知道，記者的頹　所能稱讀的，只不過百中之一而已。</p>

<h3>擴大救亡宣傳　救亡劇團繼續公演　招待香港沉降珉衆特別減收票價　今晨起三天七場仍在利舞臺演出</h3>
<p>轟動全港的中國救亡劇團出國首次公演、終於在轉瞬之間、溜走過去了、事實給我們一個强有力的證明、「中教」這次的義演，舉凡劇情、演技、佈景、電光、服裝……一切構成戲劇藝術的條件，無不偉大空前、使人贊美叫絕、「馳騁南北戰場二十月、千百萬軍民熱烈愛護，舉竟是名不虛傳的、這次、有機會欣實過中救公演的觀衆、無時不大感奮中回味着、未嘗看過的、亦不免悵然若有所失、「囘味一的親衆希翼「再來一次公演」、以飽眼福、向隅的觀衆、亦希冀「再來一次公演」、以補遺憾、因此、籲請「中救」「再來一次公演」就成爲廣大的愛國僑胞、及戲劇愛好者一致的要求了、</p>
<p>「中救」劇團、以此次公演、雖然一連三晚均吿滿座、但是、觀衆多　中上階層，事屬偏重於完成籌款救濟傷兵難民之任務而已、爲普遍於廣大學生羣衆及市民大衆之宣傳、藉收更宏大效果起見、遂應「再來一次公演」的要求、自今天起、一連三天、作第七四三次招待香港學生民衆的大規模公演、這是讀者最愛聽的消息吧、</p>
<p>過去「中救」在國內七百多次公演、都是不收費的公開招待、可是，香港畢竟不像國內一樣、郊外曠野隨處就是劇場、旣然是在戲院演出、因爲院租座位和其他環境的關係、就不得不稍爲限制了，因此、票價是規定四毫、二毫、一毫、三種、然而、這樣大衆化的票價、在香港實在算是空前的了？公演時間及劇名，計、今天（星期日）上午十時及下午三時均演「保衛祖國」、今晚八時「台兒莊之春」、明天（廿九日）下午三時及晚八時「民族萬歲」、後天（三十日）下午二時及晚八時「台兒莊之春」、這司算是香港戲劇界空前有意義的偉舉、</p>
<p>「中救」爲便利各校學生參觀起見、昨日嘗招待各校校長妥商辦法，凡是學校或團體具函證明者、得先一天到利舞台定座、記者寫此稿時、聽得今天門票已售出大半，「中救」前三天的公演、原就是打破紀錄的義舉、今次再度擴大宣傳，更是僥有意義、「中救」千辛萬苦、鞠躬盡瘁的精神、亦彌加可佩、為接受抗戰的洗禮、為欣賞最進步的戲劇藝術、以空前低廉的票價、去參觀中救公演、實在是一個空前的機緣、至盼廣大的僑胞千萬別錯過這個機會、「中救」演戲之後、就要出國負起更大的任務了、凡是看過「中救」演戲的、無不深深受其感動、觀「中救」的戲去吧、一定不會使你失望的、</p>

<h3>清從民衆英勇殺×紀</h3>
<p>— 葉耐冰</p>
<p>廿日上午三時×六百多，果眞由從化經桅杼到白兎（桅杆西北約十五里）。自衛團早就在那兒警戒，便即時奮起迎戰。×遇截擊，旣不能前進，略爲後退，並分路迂迥我自衛團，那時我各鄉村即嗚　召集團員出動，不一刻兒，便有二千多團員出來，當把×人切為兩股包園了，一股在竹爾，另一股在矮仔嶺，×以屋宇爲掩護，頑强抵抗，而我自衛團因爲沒有大砲，不能攻破房屋，所以沒有辦法消滅×人，經一夜　戰之後，廿一日我正規軍機趕到來助戰，同時另派一部，由馬團附率領去抄襲左翼，于是民氣更爲振奮了，便一擁將竹爾的×人消滅了。當　打死×人六七十人，傷的當然更多，同時執獲×人機槍數挺，步槍數十，子彈不可以數計，同日我軍另一部，斜出太平場側擊，斷×歸路，廿二日×機三架來助戰，向我陣地投彈，開機槍掃射，並投下子彈乾糧接濟被困之×，復增援千名步兵，我自衛團對外作戰，這是第一次，因沒有經騐，畏懼×機，同時×增援新力軍，向我外綫猛　，因此包圍綫動搖，×得突圍而出。我退守官莊琶江口東南卅餘里　樓嶺一帶高地，但我仍不斷向×猛烈衝擊劇戰三晝夜之後，廿三日晨×突向我糊亂發炮　　　　强多落空，我未予理會，×乃自動退却。</p>
<p>很顯然這次×開侵淸遠，但終歸給我民衆抗日自衛團打敗了，這還不過是第一次。</p>
<p>這次戰役的結果，×人死傷官兵四百餘，我獲步槍廿餘支，機槍五挺，大砲兩門，子彈萬多發，我民衆死傷卅餘人，鰲頭爐一帶民房被×燒　三百餘間</p>
<p>此後×人更加痛恨淸遠琶江區的自衛團了，老羞成怒之餘，竟以×機在從化花縣一帶散放傳單，公言懸賞五十元，捉拿自衛團隊員一名。</p>
<p>於是琶江區民衆積極購買槍械，增强自衛力量，從新又購得　機槍五十多挺，步槍千餘枝。鑒於這次抗戰的失敗，缺乏子彈，無醫藥等等；並同時請求政府補充子彈，發給戰時軍糧藥物，和撫恤陣亡隊員家屬。</p>
<p>再接再厲</p>
<p>×人潰敗後，愈更不甘心，四月六日的早晨，×人一師　另騎兵，總數在一萬以上，由太平場神　渡河後，經木棉分三路北犯。另一路由花縣來牽掣我右翼，太平場方面的×到了騎龍山便給我截擊，不能前進，便繞道犯運潮，另一部直趨鰲頭，另一部斜出淸從公路，經桅杆人和匯合，鰲頭花縣方面，一枝亦犯白石　攻　墩，企圖會合於廟墩，逆料×所經各點，均遭我軍堵塞，慘敗之餘，正想從小路迂迴我後方，但到處都有自銜團，星棋密佈，嚴陣以待了。×人到了坑，蓮湖，黄羅，鰲頭，水西，西湖里，楊馬村，白兎，人和墟，廟墩等，都被我民衆猛烈的襲擊，使得×人無路可逃，潰不成軍，忙亂地向原處（太平場）逃竄。</p>
<p>這次參加作戰的團員，大約七百多人。經過大戰三日夜的戰果，×人的死屍卽時便搶運去了。雖無法確計，但×人之傷亡，總在一千以上，我團員傷二人，死一人，並獲許多戰利品。</p>
<p>現在琶江區自衛團員，有四千餘員，　足新式步槍與子彈，另有輕重機槍百餘挺，統歸民衆抗日自衛團琶江辦事處指揮。</p>
<p>他們的步驟，是齊一的，精神，是勇敢的；每一個人都正面着大時代，他們已成爲了不可輕侮的抗戰前鋒了！</p>

<h3>梵華林聖手傑夏海發滋上銀幕　完成一部音樂鉅片</h3>
<p>一年以前、製片巨頭山姆高爾温曾宣佈已與世界聞名梵華林聖手傑夏海法滋Jascha　Heifetz簽訂合同、並將開拍、Angels　Making　Musfc一片、該片叙述一個猶太音樂家被納粹德國驅逐的故事、不幸隔不了一星期、歐洲局勢突變、於是該項計劃不得不停頓、</p>
<p>不過　發滋的合同却並未取消、高爾温會請一班著名樂隊、爲他的梵華林伴奏、這些都攝在影片上、而且藏在高爾温的箱字裏幾達一年之久、原因是缺乏適當劇情、</p>
<p>最近、古巴小姐Irmgarde　Von　Cube編的描寫音樂學校情形的劇本、很中高爾温的意、决定　製、同時把去年拍成的底片從箱子裏找出、作為演奏場面、於是夏海發滋得有機會在銀幕上與我們相見、</p>
<p>據說該片現已開攝、主角是瑪高史蒂芬遜、佐麥克利華德勃萊納三人、至於該片名、首先採用“The　Exiles”後來改爲“The　Resless　Age”</p>
<h3>歌王美眷</h3>
<p>在銀壇下的影迷們，大該總不會忘記那一對歌國裏的帝后、珍尼麥唐和奈爾　埃第·歷年來的偉大歌舞劇都引得每一個人如醉如狂，戮院門前，車水馬龍。這種盛况就可見到那兩位號召力的偉大。而事實上，他們的作品也一部比一部優越，不論情節，佈景，歌唱，以及表情都足當美麗兩字。</p>
<p>在過去，他們的作品，都是古裝，所用的色彩是單純的黑白的，（除了「桃花恨」的一慕粉紅色場面），但是在這歌王美眷却有了　人的改革。他們穿的是最漂亮的時裝，尤以珍尼麥唐納的幾幕時裝展覽，式樣新穎，色彩和。幾件大衣，沒有一件不是別出心裁，無論中西裝都是很適宜的。本片的色彩是不可多見的；鮮艷的天然色彩影片都是露天的，秀麗的山水，鮮艷的花草，本能地，就顯出了美麗的色彩，但是，在「比翼雙飛」裏的場面都是室內的、在這特殊的情況下、那鮮研的色彩就靠那美麗的服裝和悅目的佈景了、無論一桌一几都有着引人感到賞心悅目的妙處、再配上那偉大的舞台場面、美麗的舞，彩爛的背景、假使這是一齣沒有情節的片子、那色彩已足使人感到興奮了、何况那裏還有一個非常入情入理的故事、你可以當他是在諷刺你可以當他是在勸世。總之，「比翼雙飛」是一張情節色彩歌舞佈景在同等的發展下而產生的鉅片。那裏還有許多的笑料，如果你感到這春天是太煩惱的話，我勸你趕快上那兒去解解悶</p>
<h3>歌王美眷瑣眷</h3>
<p>比翼雙飛開攝之日、一九三八年六月十八日、正是珍娓、麥唐納的生日和她結婚的一周紀念日、</p>
<p>在「比翼雙飛」裏敎麥唐納唱歌的是阿爾白天那、賴區、他是麥唐納十歲生在紐約初次登台時的舞蹈敎師、</p>
<p>麥唐納有紅髮、綠眼珠、身長五尺五寸、體重一百十八鎊、</p>
<p>在攝製「比翼雙飛」的時候、一共用去一萬五千碼的衣料，五萬尺的絲網、</p>
<p>最偉大的場面、是唱「比翼雙飛」主題歌的一幕、納爾暹愛迪和麥唐納立在八十尺高的地方、四週有雲霞的佈景、閃閃的星光、</p>
<p>用以啟開舞台大幕的馬達、共有四十隻、可見工程之浩大，</p>
<p>在全片中代價極大而不容易看到的是扮成八十六個荷籣女子所穿鞋子上的瓦崙式橡皮跟、</p>

<h3>戲劇學校　米高梅公司出口　主演　露意絲蘭納　阿侖馬賽爾　竇蓮高黛</h3>
<p>靑年的柏斯加和伊文是在戀愛中。西蒙有全巴黎最美的腿，並且在歌舞班裏還有個工作，弗勞萊前程希望正大。曼都，美美和克萊兒是好朋友。娜娜有皮衣，珠飾，還有一張傲慢的臉容。他們鄱有着共同的抱負，希望將來能成爲藝壇名伶。這戲劇學校是法國國家劇院附設的，正是踏上成功的接脚石。</p>
<p>意絲瑪彭也有抱負咧，並且很多。如果她美有麗，那末是趴人還沒有注意到，因為寧靜的舉止和破舊的衣飾不能顯露美麗。如果她有天才，也辦有柏斯加大哥，學校裏的指導，有一點這樣的感覺。他是太熱切的相信自己要在一班中出人頭地。</p>
<p>其餘的人却是快樂的，放浪的，野心的孩子，都是年輕投機家，冀求在這上面得到名，利，和亨樂。但是意露絲的希望不同，她要把自已貢獻給藝術，直等自己不再是露意絲瑪彭，面是歡十百個名人——茶花女，朱麗葉，約安達克，瑪麗安東妮，依萊克屈拉，愛格倫——的靈魂的再現。</p>
<p>「我總有一天要把這些角色都扮演的，」她時常感情地對她同房間的爽直的安尼這樣說。「等着瞧吧。我要使全世界的人都崇拜我。要他們流淚，歡笑——生活受到情感和美實的感動。」</p>
<p>現實剛毅的安妮，並不常以爲然。「我希望你從這上面同時也能得到金錢」！</p>
<p>露意絲就會不在意的囘答：「當然。很多金錢，不過它不是重要的。」</p>
<p>她們永是欠着房錢；吃的也只是二一些硬麵包和臘腸。「屋，不錯！」安尼嘲笑說，「一點也不重要！每一位富翁都會對人這樣說的。」在暗底下她覺她的朋友有些痴　。但她敬愛她這是一樣——敬受她的遍柔，她的天眞，以及她的毅力。　（未完）</p>

<h3>論上海日圓跌價</h3>
<p>近來上海市場中的日圓價値　跌、在十天前、中國法幣和日幣的價格、小有消長、不相上下、而三天以來、日幣百圓在最低的時間、祗能換得法幣八十九元、更據上海日本大使館發言人聲稱、這種情形無足深異，此後恐怕還有繼續發展的可能、現在中國淪陷區域內流通的日圓、乃是日本所發紙幣的一部分、這一部分日圓價格的迅速降落、實已透露出日本的貨幣膨漲已經到了怎樣的程度、</p>
<p>中日國在交戰之中、兩國貨幣價値是兩國經濟情况的寒暑表、兩國各採行外匯統制政策、各有其法定的貨幣外匯價格、且價格相同、卽每日圓合英金一先令二便士、而法幣每元亦合英金一先令二便士、可是流入中國淪陷區域的日圓，在上海天津香港等市場上的外匯價格、和法幣一樣、都遠離了政府的法定標準、去年六月、法幣百元可換日圓九十五元弱、十二月可換日圓九十二元、當時法幣在黑市場的外圍價格爲每圓合英金八便士、所以日　在黑市場的外匯價格確是也祇在每元八九便士之間、法幣的法定匯價爲一先令二便士、而黑巿價格爲八便士、日本方面嘗取爲宣傳的、絕好資料、用以證實中國法幣基的薄弱、其實日圓實價、正與法幣半斤八兩、到了現在、上海法幣在黑市場依然維持八便士的價格、而日元對法幣的兌換率每百日圓、祗能値法幣八十九元了、這就是說日圓外匯價格、祗剩七便士强了、中國的淪陷區域、是在日本控制之下的、日圓與法幣、日本大可上下其手、抑揚其問、爲甚麽日本不能使淪陷區域內的日圓，維持他的法定的標準、而聽其將價格低减到了中國法幣以下呢、這是寒暑表說明什麼、</p>
<p>這次上海日圓價格的暴跌、絕不是偶然的現象、乃是日本實施戰時經濟政策的成果、日本自對華作戰以來、軍費的來源、差不多完全取給於公債和紙幣的發行、其中紙幣一項、迄去年年底止、已增發十憶圓以上、這種巨額的紙幣、其流通的範圍、不僅在日本國內、並且遍及於其所屬的各殖民地、近來日本對華作戰範園逐漸擴大需要的戰費也隨着逐漸增加，紙幣的增發乃成爲不可避免的事實、今年三月日本政府曾正在國會中提出議案、主張將日本台灣朝鮮三大銀行的發行額增加百分之四十到六十、日本國內因爲過去通貨的漲、已使一般人民感受極端的痛苦、現在爲保持日本國內社會的安甯起見、自不能不盡量將增加的紙幣、卽貨幣漲的現象、以中國淪陷區域爲尾閭、於是乎充斥而貶價、</p>
<p>日本爲增加軍費、爲取得中國淪陷區域內的各種資源、並為建立所謂便於對日貿易的「日圓集團」同時又爲避免日圓漲予國內不可收拾的惡影響起見、於是採取變相的間接的辦法、</p>

<p>原定上星期六舉行的足球義賽、當時遇雨、遂吿改期、而南華隊的南遊行程、亦因事遲遲未開拔、所以　幕義賽、冉訂期昨天開演、怎料天不透美、陰雨連綿、又誤了球場好事、一般迷民、也十分掃興、</p>
<p>南華當局、爲完成此次義舉起見、决改于今天下午五時半、仍在加山舉行、屆時卽再下雨、亦决不展期、因爲該隊已定本月　日出發南遊、以行期所限、礙難延擱、倘若今天猶不演出、便須待秋凉時候、才有機會、</p>
<p>南華所排的陣線、並非全數是南遊征人、因其中有一二位或不能偕行的、但時至今日、其南遊人選、猶未完全决定、不知是何原故、或謂負貨者愼重將事、我則謂「打得更多夜又長」、</p>
<p>聯隊方面、乃以海軍爲主力、適領昨天「鷹艦」自星囘港、或者今天上陣人馬、將有小更動、若能够改善內　線、加强守力、則到時定有包滿人意的表演、好事在前、惟天作主、</p>
<p>聽　中堅一　、將調狄臣担任、這個家扒、本領不凡、旣善出擊、守亦够工夫、但卒內衛終嫌用不得當、洞漏必多、卽使狄臣常會退後助守、亦未必濟事、然而、若狄臣登場、南華就不官常　中央突破之法、須側重左右游擊、才易收效、兩軍排陣如下、（球塲太歲）</p>

<h3>不講理</h3>
<p>— 華父</p>
<p>人雖然是「萬物之靈」，樣樣　過了萬物，却可惜　沒有完全悅離「萬物」的範圍，還保全着一些「物」性，不講理。</p>
<p>不講理出之於不識字的人，編氓小民，或者野蠻人，那倒也就罷了，因爲這些人本來是時常　視作「萬物」之類，而　剝奪「靈」之雅稱的，然而不幸，不講理却一樣也會出之於讀書人，高官顯爵，或號稱文明的人，並目後者不講理的程度，似乎有時　要比前者厲害些。</p>
<p>在從前，謀佔田　，强奸婦女，包攬詞訟，實行「你的就是我的，我的是動也動不得的」，那一個不是讀書人？「州官」可以「放火」，「百姓」不可以「點燈；「君要臣死，不得不死，父要子亡，不得不亡」；「天下無不是的父母」：一道上論下來，凌遲處死，而被處死者，還要三跪九叩首，「謝恩」領死。……諸如此類。不是强詞奪「理」，便是傷天害「理」，比了欄路打刦，說要留下「貿路錢」，全武行械門之前，還有茶樓「評理」，好了些什麽來？</p>
<p>在現在，益發不得了，也許果然是程度的增高吧。別的且不要說，就看看號稱最文明的國家，牠門的不講理，簡直造成了新紀錄，不但空前；並且絕後，使後之來者，望塵莫及，牠門動不動就要亡人之國，囊括別國的土地，蹂躪無辜的人民，刦奪別人的所有動產，置一條約，協定於不顧，不情願作合「理」商量，談判，討論，甚至對他們呼籲，哀懇，求吿，也都置之「不理」，吾行吾素。尤其可惡的，他們却還口口聲聲說，這是爲了和平；。遭是爲了某一區域的安定，這是爲了世界的幸福。牠們的狠毒，惡辣，兇暴，眞到了無可「理喻」的地步，也眞激俗話所說，「李樹」是種在他們的門前的，因此，天下「有理」的，只此一家——三位一體之一家——並無分出。</p>
<p>有一些「君子人」，自命存心厚道，以爲天下「正理」只有一條，「歪理」倒有千條，他們揀多的的地方走，也有他們的不得已，如果將「正理」開放一下，多添幾條，他們就不會專走「歪理」了。却不料這樣一來，就格外壞了事，正像老虎本來不知人味，偶然有個「善心人」，看見他餓，洒些血他吃吃，他嘗到了味道，素性要吃人了，也像東郭先生，救出了中出狼，他索性要吃他了。</p>
<p>我認為這種不講理的人，頭腦是一定有毛病的：不然，爲什賽他們會那樣的不顧人情天理呢？對付他們的方法，除了如醫治病人，與以吃藥打針那樣，向之作相當的勸導以外，更需要當頭的　喝，使他們猛然醒悟。否則就只有關他們起來，聽其自生自滅。因爲講理是「蠻」的，對付眞正「蠻」的人，就只好這權，不講理是無是非之心：「無是非之心，非人也」，對付「非人」，也只好這樣。</p>
<p>「人之將死，其言也善」。善，也許可以作「講理」講。一世的姦雄曹操，畢生幹了多少不解理的事情，到他將死時却就有了分香賣履」的遺囑出來，就是「」，就是講理了。我看，現在善一般不講理的，大約誰也要到死才肯覺悟吧！。</p>
<p>那末，今之「君子人」，或者「善心人」，果然要送佛送到西天，幹得徹底，還該設法促使這些不講理者，早早達到「其言也善」的地步才是！聖旦</p>
<h3>盧將軍——戰地追記</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>老　往瑞昌軍次後，劍　因爲假期已滿，不日就要出發咸甯，而我，從六安到了漢口，也必須　回大別山中，去繼續我應做的工作。這時，武漢外圍的戰事，已進入嚴重階段；但因爲和盧漢將軍訂了會見的預約，不能不稍稽時日，以便一瞻那位滇軍　將的丯采；况且他在合兒莊一役，建有特殊的功績，為了蒐集些珍貴的史料，也覺得有會見的必要；所以雖然整裝待發，還沒有馬上和武漢作別。同時，他這次擔任的防區，恰在粵漢綫的湘省終點，如果三鎮被吞噬的話，那麼，在鄂西方面，他所負的責任很大，因此，我囘到大別山中的行期，一展就展延了兩星期。</p>
<p>記得是空襲挺厲害的一天，漢陽飛機塲又添了幾處深潭，總算泥土倒楣，無端飛揚了一囘，他們把「悉索　賦一得來的東西，老是和泥土拚命。眞覺得未免浪費。所以從戰地囘來的朋友，對轟炸都表示着滿不在乎的神氣。等到警報解除之後，話機響了：「盧將軍在湖南街鼎裕里等候你，請馬上就來，他下午還是過江去的—」遠是政訓處彭處長的口音，一口雲南話。</p>
<p>當我到達了鼎裕里，首先出現在面前的，便是雲南女子戰地工作團的幾位年靑姑娘，她們從徐州突圍出來，步行了七百里的長途。沒有一些疲乏，和我在華陽見到的皖大女生戰地工作團，同樣的精神抖擻。「聖誕老人來了，一定有什麽禮物帶來的？」姑娘們眞會開玩笑我和她祇有作過一次的訪問，居然很熟識了。可是我有什麼　物呢？一點都沒有；有的，祗有尊敬的相見禮。</p>
<p>盧將軍會見了。那麽「温文爾雅」的態度，準會懷疑他是一個學者，不，大學敎授吧？他很有秩序的談話，又活像一位「善於辭令」的外交家。談話一直延長到兩小時，只才停止；話題當然是過云的台莊戰役。最後，說他：「在將來凱旋的時候，我們在黃鶴樓頭相見吧！」</p>
<p>誠摯的徵笑中，我和盧將軍握手道別。</p>
<h3>學哭</h3>
<p>— 毅初</p>
<p>好像有人說過一句話：「哭是懦弱的表示。」是的，兩個小孩打架，懦弱者必敗，敗則必哭」：由此我們可以證明「哭是懦弱的表示」這句話是對的，那我們又何必去學」它？</p>
<p>然而聰明人說：哭是一種做人的方法，成功的秘訣。他們的理由是「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，而打動別人惻隱心的方法，便走「哭」。他們又舉了一大批成功的人物，像　玄德，條申包胥，像……等來證明「哭」是成功的秘訣。「哭」旣是成功的秘訣，則其重要可知，而又烏不可「學」呢？然則如何學？「學」後如何「致用」？不妨舉例以明之：</p>
<p>譬如：你看到了社會上人心不古，世風日下，於是你便在大庭廣衆間演說其補救之法，但是不可不落幾滴眼淚：或者發表論文，可是論文中千萬不可略去了「嗚呼」——洋化一些的用「呀」——兩個字，那來人家才會給你感動，送你一個「道學家」的頭銜。在馬路上碰到了難民伸手向你討錢時，你盡可掉頭不顧而走——愈走愈快愈好；但是回到了府上，却一定要「平平仄仄」做幾首「哀　民」或「哭難胞」的古詩或新詩，再用上一個「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨」的古典，登在報紙或雜誌上，於是人家便會稱你是「詩翁」送你一個「慈善家」的頭　。府上死了父母或其它的尊長，你不妨看看電影或者　樓舞女，然而最要緊的還是在「訃」「聞」或「報喪』，廣吿中，决不可漏刊了「泣血」等宇樣］雖然你心中是毫不痛苦。但是見了朋友，眼睛一定要像血一般　通紅，說起話來，聲音必須略帶些抖顫，那麽人家這是說你能够「哀毀骨立」，冠你以「孝子」之頭銜，同樣談起國家大事來，必須痛哭流涕，或泣不成聲，表示你的一愛國不敢後人」，因此人家還是冠你以「愛國者」的頭銜，……</p>
<p>假使你不要頭銜，那麽哭不是無所施其技了嗎！可也有其他的用法。</p>
<p>例如：你要向人借錢，必須哭喪着臉。（如能眞哭更好，不能則至少要帶些哭的樣子，（那未人家才相信你眞個無錢，委使淸苦，否則，你準會　壁，撞一鼻子的灰，你在校中成績不及格，你只要到先生那裏，痛哭流涕，最好能聲淚俱下，說明這次不及格的理由，那末你便可以及格，可以升級。如果你同丈夫吵了嘴，或者打了架，吃了虧，那末你只要「哭」，「哭」祖宗的香台，一小時，兩小時，一天兩天……那末你的丈夫一定會從此心折，拜倒在你的短旗袍下，唯命是從。</p>
<p>自從哭道問世以後，一傳十，十傳百，競相效尤，各遝匠心，弄得陰風慘慘，鬼哭神號，於是余乃提筆判曰：</p>
<p>「爲人之道在偽，爲偽之道在哭，聰明人不死，禍亂不止！」</p>
<h3>訴</h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>不是低微的呻吟，更不是狂風　的呼嘯。只是我門千萬民衆的淚，流成了海，這海裏　出那巨浪似的聲響。我們這千萬困苦的心——也許是最不幸的。那些受着另一種不同的命運支配底人們從不曾想到這口受過了苦難的心，誰知道有時心上被付與深沉的痛楚使我們忘了身體亦是同樣無依的流浪，誰給我們友愛的情誼　那是夢想—他們到底有着自己的命運，有時也拋下給我們一絲眞摯的同情的眼光在一剎那，然而，掉轉頭以後，他們更深戀着自己的命運，向誰去訴？眞理已穩進深邃的谿谷，早忘掉了我們這一羣人。</p>
<p>我們被支配的演着悲劇，眞理，可曾給我們一點光亮？須要有黑暗中的一綫光，只要能給我們一點期望，我們就可以去尋探。</p>
<p>爲什麽我們的家要變成瓦灰？在那裏面我們並沒有過分的享受；爲什麽那些不成形的血肉蓋上了我們的稻田？爲什麽奪走我們的愛兒，他不會得餓着要奶吃，不再親切地倚在懷中喊一聲「怕」？爲什麽會讓眼淚在那緊抱着的自己已斷底手臂上？……</p>
<p>眞理，再照明了這世間，別輕輕丟下我門這羣多少萬受苦的人，給我們一綫期望。</p>
<p>泊的，無歸宿的行走，永遠沒有季節似的流浪，當熾烈火夏，讓太陽毫不留情的毒射着，汗水浸着不乾的破爛衣服。那兒也有大的房子，然而我們不敢伸足，因爲他們並不需要眞理。日子永還是這般的溜走，季候對我們並沒有寬裕，刺骨的寒風在嚴冬裏襲着身體。我們披護在身上的依然是炎夏時穿的那件破衣，雖然身體凍僵，可是還有沒凍死而知事的心，這心上永劃着一個疑問—「這難道是眞理的判决？」</p>
<p>天！這並不是詛咒，因爲這也許是命運，看着那光亮而温暖的地方，但我們沒有勇氣去叩鬥，誰耐煩聽我們的哀訴，那一扇門肯谷納我們這無家的沭浪者，卽使狂風吹倒那抵不住饑寒的軀體，在別人眼中也許等於一隻凍死的狗。</p>
<p>有誰曾經目睹白已老邁的父母底血塗上了鋒利的尖刀，在那泥灰裏倒臥着在苦痛地呻吟，他們的心也和別人的父母別子女一般的慈愛，但他們却再到與情理相背的遭遇，他們從不怨子女不如別人，然而在他們永別時的心中仍牽掛著一個思念，深怕在這血地上受苦的兒女會遭到更慘酷的摧殘！</p>
<p>每當我們在禱吿着眞理的來臨，覺得喉間塞着東西像是心裏血往下滴。自己深況的語昔變成了顫抖的泣聲，還有什麽更苦的等我們去受？然而我們並不企望去死，也許在舌到盡頭時我們終會得到拯救，忍緊了痛，懷這樣着的期望；在層層烏雲後會蔽，太陽，黑暗總有被逐出世界的一天！</p>
<h3>歸鄉途中　（中）</h3>
<p>— 王里</p>
<p>——是打汽車嗎？……是黄衣人下鄕嗎？——</p>
<p>我默忖着。</p>
<p>在前面的路上，有農民向這邊兩兩三三逃了過來，我走上了一個土坵，向前面瞭望着，在一帶樹叢的背後，忽然升起了黑烟，接着，黑烟一處又一處的升了起來</p>
<p>我問了自前面倉皇地走近的農民，知道是黄衣兵在修理被毀的橋梁，發洩着固有的戚風，</p>
<p>我退囘了剛才走過的一個小村子，在傍晚的時候，才繞道越過了公路。</p>
<p>在次日，我與一個老百姓同路走着，一路上，我們像熟識的朋友一樣談着話，每遇一個茶棚子，我們就休息一囘，喝幾碗茶或唱一點白乾，（他是一個愛喝酒的朋友，）</p>
<p>在我們走下了一個黄土披，經過黄山寺的時候，在我們的背後，大概是歇浦那邊，傳來了響亮的很密的砲聲。</p>
<p>不知是爲什麽，在長久歲月中，我養成了對於鎗砲的聲音有像激蕩在淸晨的空氣中的軍號聲一樣的愛聽，</p>
<p>我聽着了砲聲，步履變得有力了起來，每一個特別　亮的砲聲，使我感到說不的出是什麽心理的快感。</p>
<p>一路上，老百姓都恐怖裏滲看喜悅，喜悅裏滲看恐怖，徬徨地相語着，或茫然的佇立著，望着砲聲響着的遼遠的那邊。</p>
<p>在太陽沉西沉的時候，我與同路的老百姓分了手，就到了一個小村鎭。（未完）</p>

<h3>Striving for the Final Five Minutes – A Critique of Defeatism</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>Ever since Wang Jingwei published his scandalous telegram on December 29th of last year, echoing the statement of the former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and openly advocating for peace, his arguments have already been subjected to the most severe criticism. On January 1st, the Central Party Headquarters permanently expelled him from the party and removed him from all his positions; this was the government's stern criticism of him. On March 21st, five patriotic individuals from overseas broke into Wang's residence in Hanoi at night, intending to eliminate this traitor for the country. Although Wang managed to escape death, his secretary, Zeng Zhongming, took his place; this was the people's stern criticism of him. He has received such consistent criticism from the nation from top to bottom. If Wang Jingwei still retained any sense of national consciousness, he should have been awakened and become cautious and silent. However, recently, he has disregarded everything and increasingly acted perversely. At the beginning of this month, he published an article called "Giving an Example" in his newspaper, the South China Daily in Hong Kong, in order to prove that his advocacy for peace was justified. He altered a confidential document from the central government and published it without authorization. Mr. Wu Zhihui's rebuttal to his article, titled "A Further Explanation of Wang Jingwei's 'Giving an Example'," can be said to be a very gratifying event. On April 8th, he published another article, "Reply to a Certain Overseas Chinese Gentleman," in which he wantonly slandered the soldiers fighting heroically at the front. According to him, it seems as if our brave soldiers are not even as good as the soldiers who lost the country during the Song and Ming dynasties. The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission recently issued an article in response to his letter, titled "The Crime of Wang Jingwei Slandering the Officers and Soldiers Fighting the War of Resistance," which severely criticized him. In addition to Wang Jingwei's own articles, his newspaper continues to publish many absurd statements, and his faction is also actively spreading rumors and confusing people, seemingly determined to destroy the entire situation of the War of Resistance. This should be something that all of our citizens cannot tolerate.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and his faction's argument for peace is always based on Konoe's so-called statement of "establishing a new order in East Asia." Looking at their statements, they consistently believe that this thing is completely reliable, which is truly a bit incredible. Konoe's statement was issued on December 21st of last year, and on December 26th, our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, already delivered an incisive speech, refuting it completely, saying that it was "a total exposure of all the planned content of the Japanese to destroy our country and annihilate our people; a total confession of all the wild hopes and conspiracies of the Japanese to completely swallow China, dominate East Asia, and then attempt to conquer the world." After such a refutation, people throughout the country understood the Japanese treacherous plan. However, Wang Jingwei still published a telegram on the 29th to echo it, saying that the proposed peace conditions were not conditions for national subjugation. He was dazzled by seeing Konoe say that he did not want China to cede territory or pay reparations. In fact, if China joined his so-called "new order," it would be no different from becoming a vassal state of Japan, and Konoe clearly demanded that Japanese citizens be able to freely reside and do business in the interior of China. This means that the entire land of China would become Japanese territory, so why would he still ask you to cede territory, and why would he still ask you to pay reparations? Wang Jingwei even sincerely believed that the demands in Konoe's statement for "China to recognize Japan's stationing of troops in specific locations for anti-communism, and to designate Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone," and "to grant Japan active facilitation in the development and utilization of resources in North China and Inner Mongolia," were so-called non-conditions for national subjugation, and that what Japan wanted was only Inner Mongolia and North China, and not Central and Southern China. The Japanese troops in Central and Southern China could be completely withdrawn, so even if China lost half of its territory, it would still have half left to serve as a small court in a corner, so it could not be considered national subjugation. Wang Jingwei was explaining it this way in his scandalous telegram. However, after the publication of his telegram, the Japanese side had already stated in the newspapers that he had "misunderstood." The statement in the newspapers was naturally not enough, so we can also reveal the formal responses of the Japanese Minister of the Army and Minister of the Navy in their parliament this year.</p>
<p>On January 30th of this year, at the Budget General Assembly of the House of Representatives, in response to a question from Representative Kita Ryokichi regarding the issue of stationing troops in China, the Japanese Army Minister Itagaki and Navy Minister Yonai both gave clear answers. Itagaki said that it was necessary to station troops in China for a considerable period of time, so the army was also considering and preparing facilities for semi-permanent troop stationing, and the Japanese troops' food, clothing, and housing would all be supplied by China. He also said, "Since the statement on December 22nd, there have been rumors outside that the Japanese army would withdraw troops from Central and Southern China. This is completely a rumor and absolutely untrue." He also added words such as "special solemn declaration" to this sentence. Yonai then praised Itagaki, saying that it was extremely appropriate for the Japanese army not to underestimate Central and Southern China, and that the Japanese navy would continue to strictly guard Central and Southern China even after the incident, in order to contribute to the "construction of a new order in East Asia." This can be considered clear and reliable evidence, right? We believe that Wang Jingwei and his faction must have seen such a clear answer. Therefore, Konoe's statement was already refuted completely by our leader in our country, and even the Japanese military department itself exposed its deception in Japan itself. However, Wang Jingwei still believes it, and after issuing the telegram, he still wants to "give an example" and "reply to a certain gentleman." In his "giving an example," he still says that Konoe's statement is not harsh and can be used as a basis for negotiation. In his "reply to a certain gentleman," he even more vigorously says that as long as the conditions for peace are not conditions for national subjugation, we should show the determination and courage to negotiate peace. His true intention, needless to say, is still to stubbornly insist that the conditions in Konoe's statement are not conditions for national subjugation. Please also see his "important statement" published in the South China Daily on April 9th. He said that since he had published the scandalous telegram, then all subsequent actions would be based on the telegram, consistently implementing the advocacy of peace. He also said that he opposed Japan changing its understanding and changing its conditions due to further military victories. He even had a hope for the Japanese authorities, hoping that "the Japanese authorities would deeply observe the facts, sincerely consult, and ensure that China is a country with complete territorial sovereignty." This is truly a dream. The conditions proposed by Konoe are no longer conditions, yet you are still afraid that they will "change" them. Our Republic of China, a dignified independent country, cannot be independent and autonomous, but instead wants to hope that the Japanese authorities will "make" us become "a country with complete territorial sovereignty." What kind of talk is this? Isn't this Wang Jingwei himself clearly expressing his heart's desire to kneel and surrender to Japan? Therefore, all of his actions, such as the Wang-Pingnuma Agreement, such as sending Gao Zongwu to Japan to beg for peace, such as secretly contacting [Japanese] in Shanghai and Hong Kong, these are all put aside for the moment. Just based on Wang Jingwei's own publicly published statements, it is enough to prove that he is intent on surrendering to Japan.</p>
<p>If you want to surrender, then just surrender. There is no harm in telling a little bit of the "truth" here. Why must you insist on saying that you are advocating for peace? Ultimately, this is a bit "dishonest."</p>
<p>China is not a warlike country. We also feel that we can make peace at any time, but there is one prerequisite, and that is for the Japanese to stop their aggression. Through our long-term War of Resistance, the Japanese crisis is becoming more and more significant every day. Consequently, some people within Japan are also aware of the danger to their own country and hope to seek peace with China in order to eliminate their own internal and external troubles. This is a fact, and we do not deny it. We even believe that this is the great harvest of China's War of Resistance, that our War of Resistance has forced Japan to the brink of crisis, and produced a desire for peace. However, the desire for peace within Japan has not yet formed a concrete force sufficient to subdue the current war-mongering faction of the Navy and Army ministries. This is also a clear fact that cannot be denied. Take Konoe as an example. He had just published his peace statement when he was soon forced to resign. Also, look at Japan's military budget for this year. Is there the slightest breath of peace and truce in it? Moreover, recently, Koiso, one of the leaders of the young officers, has newly joined the Japanese cabinet and is serving as the Minister of Colonial Affairs. All of these prove that the young officers who advocate war still maintain their control, and the desire for peace is still insufficient to sway the overall situation. Therefore, if we were to respond to the Japanese inducement for peace at this time, we would be falling for the Japanese trick of using Chinese to control Chinese and subjugating us without a fight. Such a pursuit of peace is no different from seeking surrender to Japan. I think even elementary school students can understand this. However, Wang Jingwei and his faction stubbornly and publicly advocate for it and openly engage in activities. What is their intention?</p>
<p>The country seems to be not unkind to Wang Jingwei and his faction, only expelling Wang's individual party membership and not punishing his party members, only removing Wang's individual positions and not issuing a warrant for his arrest. The Japanese land combat power has already been weakened, its finances are on the verge of bankruptcy, and it is surrounded by strong enemies on all sides at sea, and even competition in building warships makes it breathless. The Japanese are shouting "The national crisis is serious!" and "The national crisis has reached the most urgent juncture!" These are the facts, not their alarmist talk. Therefore, at present, we should intensify our counter-offensive forces in order to achieve our victorious future. We should be striving for the final five minutes. How can we relax at this time? Wang Jingwei is an extremely intelligent person. I don't believe that he cannot even see this point. Currently, it is also his own time to strive for the final five minutes. I hope that he will appreciate the country's kindness to him, remember the difficulty of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in creating the Republic of China, and remember the preciousness of the five thousand years of continuous national heritage. Do not continue to act perversely until the end.</p>
<h3>A Week's Trends in the World</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From May 21st to 27th, Year 28</p>
<p>The battle-filled, revolutionary May has reached its final week.</p>
<p>This week's current events fully demonstrate the increasingly fierce struggle between two fronts. On the side of the aggressor nations: Germany and Italy have already cast off the "anti-communist" smokescreen, declaring a military alliance ready to attack democratic countries, while Japan, the ×× in the East, has made ××'s ×× against the rights and interests of various democratic countries like Britain, the United States, and France from Shanghai to the north, Tianjin, and as far south as the waters off Hong Kong! On the side of the democratic and peaceful nations, unity has made new progress, mainly in the form of the Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, which news agencies in Britain and France have declared is established. However, in reality, there are still many shortcomings that need to be addressed through continued effort, because the crisis of world war is still approaching its point of full-scale outbreak.</p>
<p>China's War of Resistance Against Japan has seen no major changes this week. Because of our insistence on unity and continued resistance, we have aroused greater international sympathy. The League of Nations has already recognized our country as an aggressed nation and appealed for assistance from member states, and our domestic military and political situation is also progressing day by day. However, the political offensives of the Japanese ×× and traitors have become more vicious and poisonous, so we must raise our vigilance and deliver even greater blows against them!</p>
<p>(1) Germany and Italy Sign Military Alliance</p>
<p>The long-rumored German-Italian military alliance was signed on May 22nd in Berlin by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The agreement contains three articles: (1) The two countries must maintain close contact with each other forever on (a) all issues related to the interests of each country, or (b) the overall situation in Europe, until both parties reach an agreement; (2) Should the international situation affect the common interests of the two countries, the two countries shall jointly consult to protect them; (3) If the security or other important rights of one of the two countries are threatened by external forces, the other country shall provide full assistance in political and diplomatic matters, and if one of the two countries is threatened by one or more powerful nations and is in danger of being drawn into war, it shall provide assistance with all its naval, land, and air forces. In addition, there are accompanying clauses: (1) Germany and Italy will step up cooperation on economic matters in both peacetime and wartime; (2) To implement the above-mentioned Articles 1 and 2, a permanent committee shall be established, under the command of the foreign ministers of both countries; (3) In the event of war, an armistice can only be concluded with the full consent of both countries; (4) The two countries must strive to maintain friendship with common allies, most notably Japan, "Manchukuo," and Hungary; (5) The validity period of this agreement is ten years.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the "Anti-Comintern Pact," all the facts of crazily challenging and annexing the weak have proven that the three aggressor nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan had already formed a military alliance. Now, it is only because they want to intimidate Britain and France before the anti-aggression front is consolidated and expanded that they dare to remove the shameless anti-communist smokescreen and formally announce the establishment of this military alliance! At the same time, the annexation of certain "intermediate countries" in Europe can no longer satisfy the desires of the aggressors, and France and even the British mainland will immediately become the targets of aggression! As for Japan, the issue of participating in the German-Italian military alliance has caused a great uproar this week. According to a May 25th Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy, Oshima and Shiratori, even suddenly resigned because the authorities did not participate, and Foreign Minister Arita was even about to resign! But one must know that the vast majority of the Japanese people and informed people originally opposed joining the German-Italian Anti-Comintern Pact. Due to the seriousness of the crisis and difficulties of the invasion of China, internal strife and contradictions in Japan will inevitably become more intense. However, the Japanese ×× authorities' failure to participate immediately still involves their political conspiracy to induce and threaten Britain, France, and the United States. It would be a great mistake to only see that Japan has not participated and assume that the Far Eastern interests of the European and American powers are therefore guaranteed, or to believe that Japanese aggressors still have peaceful intentions!</p>
<p>(2) Dangerous Situation at Sea in the Far East</p>
<p>The events that have occurred in the Far East this week alone prove that the above assessment is quite close to the truth. The Japanese ××, while reserving the time to participate in the German-Italian military alliance, and even issuing some untrustworthy statements that they will never participate, are at the same time beginning a large-scale offensive against Britain, the United States, and France, preparing to seize all of their positions and interests in the Far East. What is manifested in concrete facts is mainly (1) the Gulangyu landing incident, where the Japanese side's attitude has become even more unreasonable and aggressive, and they have actually implemented a blockade starting on the 25th, cutting off transportation to Xiamen; (2) the seizure of concession incidents, the situation of oppression of the Shanghai concessions continues to be serious, and according to a Tianjin foreign dispatch on the 26th, the Japanese scheme to seize the Tianjin concessions is being actively planned; (3) In addition, the Japanese ×× also announced this week a comprehensive naval blockade of China's coast, implementing searches of all foreign ships, and on the 24th, the British merchant shipping company's "Rampura" was suddenly attacked one mile off the coast of Hong Kong, and the French postal ship "Athos II" was illegally searched seventeen miles off the coast of Hong Kong!</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of this kind of ×× behavior by the Japanese ×× is to seize the positions and interests of Britain, France, and the United States in China, to strengthen their rule, looting, and oppression in the areas they occupy in China: in order to alleviate their difficulties and prepare to conquer all of China and further dominate the Far East. The reason why the Japanese ×× dare to take such barbaric actions at a time when their international situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable and isolated is entirely because after the establishment of the German-Italian military alliance, Britain, France, and other countries vainly hoped that Japan would not participate, vainly hoped that they would not immediately confront the Japanese ××. Therefore, after the joint Anglo-French-American demonstration against Japan over the Gulangyu incident last week, instead of following up with resolute and further effective measures, they willingly retreated to a passive and inferior position to hold talks with the Japanese ××; this allowed the Japanese ×× to obtain unexpected benefits after their initial fear and to turn from an inferior to a dominant position. They greatly ×× × act while the four countries were talking on the Birmingham warship! In addition, the Shanghai concessions willingly serve the Japanese ××, forcing the Chinese and American newspapers that reported on aid to China, such as the Ta Mei and Chung Mei, to cease publication, arbitrarily accepting the opinions of the Wang faction ×× and the Japanese ×× and searching bookstores, arresting progressive journalist Mr. Hu Zhongchi, and so on. All of these ×× retreat measures are ways of handing the knife to the Japanese ×× and willingly sacrificing themselves! The fact that the Birmingham four-nation meeting yielded no results was expected, and what we are worried about is that if Britain, France, and other countries continue to adopt this attitude towards the Japanese ××, then a greater threat is probably right in front of us!</p>
<p>(3) The Reality of Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations</p>
<p>Just as the war clouds in the East and West are rising again, news agencies in Britain and France have reported progress in the Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance negotiations. Several news agencies and newspapers have even used phrases such as "after the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement." But what is the reality? ? It is true that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have made progress, as can be confirmed by the news from last week, especially after repeated discussions between Britain and France over the past week, followed by discussions in the British Cabinet this week. The attitude of the British authorities is indeed different than before. By the 26th of this month, French Foreign Minister Bonnet had handed the final draft of the joint Anglo-French proposal to Soviet Ambassador Suritz and asked for a prompt reply so that the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement could be announced as soon as possible. It is reported that the contents of this new proposal are roughly as follows: (1) The mutual assistance agreement will take effect when Britain, the Soviet Union, and France are invaded in European territory. However, before a formal agreement is reached, the three countries will issue a joint declaration stating that they will jointly deal with this threat. (2) Whenever the territory of any country guaranteed by the three countries is directly invaded, the three countries shall jointly consult and decide on actions. The question of which countries should be guaranteed is still to be discussed and decided. At the same time, any country that is invaded must resist first before it can enjoy the protection. (3) The three countries will convene a staff meeting to achieve the most efficient cooperation between the three countries' naval, land, and air forces. This proposal is generally closer to the principles of the mutual assistance agreement proposed by the Soviet Union, proving that the anti-fascist, anti-aggression, democratic, and peaceful front has indeed made great progress! However, this new proposal still has major, and it can be said, fundamental flaws. The first is that it does not include the Far East. London sources claim that if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement will immediately expand to the Far East, meaning that there is no need to organize a Far Eastern anti-aggression front at present. Of course, one should not overlook the psychology of the Anglo-French financial capital authorities ×× in expanding the power of the Soviet Union and China. However, the current Japanese ××'s increasing offensive against British and French positions and interests in the Far East can precisely explain that this kind of psychology should be washed away immediately, right? Second, this new proposal is still "half-hearted." They want to first use a joint declaration to suppress the German-Italian military alliance, and then proceed with formal negotiations on signing a mutual assistance agreement and holding a three-nation staff meeting. This kind of slow and relaxed step is certainly not enough to truly sanction the aggressors, nor is it enough to effectively save democracy and peace. However, we do not need to be overly worried. The needs of the international environment, the demands of the British and French people and the majority of informed authorities, the improvement of the Soviet Union's international reputation and the expansion of its influence due to its anti-fascist, anti-aggression peace policy, and the persistence and progress of China's united resistance will all force the formal establishment of the Anglo-Soviet-French mutual assistance agreement and the rapid realization of the expansion of the anti-aggression front to the Far East!</p>
<p>(4) Opening of the First Soviet Parliament</p>
<p>The first Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union in 1939 opened on the evening of the 25th at the Kremlin, with 1,600 delegates attending, representing more than 100 nationalities participating in the Soviet Socialist Federation. At a time when the old world is filled with the flames of a new war, this grand congress of the new socialist world will naturally be the focus of attention for people all over the world and will be wished for by all peaceful and just people and the vast oppressed masses. This congress will last for a week or ten days, and the topics of discussion will be foreign affairs, national defense, and the third five-year plan for the development of the national economy. Major decisions on these issues were already made at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from March 10th to 21st, which were endorsed by the entire Union and received worldwide attention. This congress will then be used by 1,600 representatives from all over the country to jointly decide on concrete measures to develop the Soviet Union's national strength, increase its international reputation, defend world peace, and realize the liberation movement to aid oppressed and invaded nations. When Finance Commissar Zverev announced in Congress that the military expenditure for 1939 was 40 billion rubles, accounting for about one-quarter of the total national budget, the attending delegates cheered for as long as nine minutes! Zverev also said that the Soviet Union's army and navy are now prepared with three times the strength to respond to the attacks of war merchants! From this, we can see the guarantee for the smooth implementation of the Soviet Union's internal and external policies.</p>
<p>The strength of the Soviet Union and the progress of our country's united resistance against Japan both tell the world: China and the Soviet Union, the two major countries, and their current strength, have become the mainstay force in defending world peace, upholding democratic politics, and safeguarding human culture! If the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement wants to succeed effectively, it cannot force or weigh the interests of China and the Soviet Union. China and the Soviet Union must achieve equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. However, to achieve this today, the first thing is for China and the Soviet Union to have even closer cooperation, and then to encourage Britain, the United States, and France to increase their friendship with China.</p>
<p>(5) League of Nations Resolution to Aid China and Sanction Japan</p>
<p>The credibility of the League of Nations has further declined due to the ×××××××× of its main member states, Britain and France, at the Munich Conference last year, but it is still the highest international organization currently aimed at maintaining world peace. Apart from the fascist aggressors, no one wants to see it destroyed, and everyone hopes that it will revive and fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, when the League of Nations convened this week, our country's representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, presented two requests to the International Executive Council on the 22nd in moving terms: First, to notify member states to expand their financial and material assistance to China in order to enhance its strength to resist aggression and carry out refugee relief work, to avoid any actions that would weaken China's resistance to aggression, to stop supplying Japan with war equipment and raw materials, especially aircraft and gasoline, and to restrict the import of Japanese goods. Second, to form a group to jointly promote the above steps. On the afternoon of the 24th, the League of Nations Executive Council held a closed-door meeting to discuss the resolution. The key points proposed by the drafting committee for our country's request were: (1) Member states should take all possible and effective measures to assist China's war of resistance; (2) The Executive Council is satisfied that a number of member states have been able to take consistent action on the Far East issue; (3) The Executive Council expresses its condolences for the steps taken by certain countries to aid China; (4) It hopes that countries will continue to aid China and increase the degree of aid; (5) It requests the consulates of member states in the Far East to study the practical effects of the steps taken by various countries to aid China. According to a Geneva dispatch on the 26th, the League of Nations Executive Council will close on the 27th, announce that China is an aggressed nation, and notify member states to strengthen individual aid to China. It is probably only up to this point that the League of Nations can do today. Although this cannot but make us feel regret, we can also, based on this decision of the League of Nations and based on the requests made by Representative Koo, step up our national diplomacy efforts and strive to promote the progress of the democratic and peaceful countries' movement to aid China and sanction Japan: The League of Nations' resolution will naturally be more beneficial to our country's activities to win foreign aid.</p>
<p>6. The Situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan This Week</p>
<p>Finally, although there have been no major changes on any battlefield in the War of Resistance Against Japan this week, there are still several characteristics worth reporting:</p>
<p>First, General Chen Cheng gave a clear report on the overall war situation at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in Chongqing on the 22nd. He said, "We do not hope to win this year or next year, but if we continue to fight for three to five years, we will definitely win the final victory." He said, "At present, Japan is not only unable to make any further progress, but is also trapped by the Chinese army in its occupied areas. In the rear areas of the Japanese army's front line, not counting guerrillas and mobile units, there are still more than 60 divisions of the Chinese regular army." General Chen finally clearly pointed out a very important point, he said, "The worst period in China has now passed! The beginning of the July 7th Incident was the most dangerous time for China, because at that time, opinions on war and peace were divided, and the national crisis was the most serious. Secondly, after the fall of Nanjing, China did suffer a tragic defeat in this battle. However, the Japanese army did not cause a decisive defeat to our army in the battles of Nanjing and Hankou. Now, this kind of opportunity will never come again!"</p>
<p>Second, × Army Distribution According to General Chen Cheng's report, the Japanese × currently have 30 infantry divisions and 3 cavalry brigades in China, distributed as follows: 3 divisions in Guangdong and Hainan Island, 3 divisions along the Jinghu Railway line and southern Anhui, 5 divisions on the border of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, 3 divisions east of Xiangfan, plus 1 cavalry brigade, 2 divisions in northern Anhui and along the Pinghan Road, 4 divisions along the Suhua and Jinpu Road lines, 3 and a half divisions in Hebei and Chahar, 2 divisions in eastern Henan and the Daoqing Road area, 1 division in Shanxi Province, and 2 divisions on the border of Shanxi and Suiyuan. Due to the increasing development of our × rear combat, it has become extremely difficult to move this force, and its offensive power is naturally even more limited.</p>
<p>Third, War Situation on Various Fronts (1) On the northern Hubei front, the × army concentrated 3 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry brigade in an attempt to encircle Tang Enbo's troops, but after three days and nights of fighting north of Zaoyang, the × army's encirclement plan was shattered. Now, Sun Lianzhong's and Liu Ruming's troops are stationed in Xinye, and Liu Heding's army is stationed in the Dabie Mountains. This week, up to the 26th, there were fierce battles in Zhehe, Anlu, Dabie Mountains, Guangcheng, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang, and more than 2,000 × were annihilated. The × has been unable to expand towards Xiangfan. (2) The fighting on the border of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, especially in the Dongting Lake area, has been fierce again this week, but the victories won by Chen Cheng's troops in Nanchang have caused the × to suffer injuries. Our counterattacks on Gaoan and Nanchang have further prevented the × army's plan to encircle our army on the border of Hunan and Hubei. In northern Hunan alone, the × launched a full-scale offensive on the 24th and 25th, and more than 1,000 of them were killed. (3) In Guangdong Province, our army has completed various deployments and is waiting for an opportunity to launch a counterattack. The guerrilla warfare in the province is also progressing day by day under the active planning and leadership of the provincial authorities. (4) On the Jiangnan battlefield, since the Jinhua Conference at the beginning of the month, our army has continued to win victories in counterattacks. One unit has already recovered Tongxiang, and another unit of the Jiangnan Army has crossed the river again to counterattack Hangzhou. (5) On the North China front, the fighting in Shanxi and Hebei continues to make progress, and on the Shandong front, Jinan has been counterattacked for days, and at one point, they even broke in.</p>
<p>Third, Japanese ×'s Difficulties The current difficulties of the Japanese × are becoming increasingly serious. In addition to the international situation, as mentioned earlier, militarily, they are increasingly feeling the shortage of troops, dangerous traffic, unfavorable terrain, difficulty in using troops, and the emptiness of the rear. Economically, they are facing financial poverty, reduced production, declining foreign trade, and the severance of the people's livelihood, leading to the repeated fall in the price of the yen. Politically, there is a high anti-war sentiment in the country, and the contradictions between warlords, financial groups, small and medium-sized asset holders, and civilians are growing. The contradictions and conflicts in the policies of the ruling class are all increasingly exposing the development of all the difficulties of the Japanese ×× in her barbaric and regressive war.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Conspiracies of the Japanese × and the Traitors What is even more serious is that these difficulties of the Japanese × cannot be overcome by Japanese strength alone. Therefore, they have recently been trying their best to use China's land, population, and production to alleviate their increasingly serious crisis. They are using political offensives in conjunction with military offensives to implement this new plan. The first step is to strengthen anti-communist and peace propaganda in order to alienate our internal unity (and then prevent national mobilization), prevent our political progress (prevent democratic politics and improve people's livelihood), and weaken our strength for long-term resistance. The next step is to step up the expulsion of European and American powers, seize concessions everywhere, control coastal shipping, then massively bomb Chongqing and plan the Xiangfan and Hubei-Hunan battles in order to consolidate and open up the occupied areas east of the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways. Finally, they will use Wang Jingwei and others to actively organize a puppet central party and government organs in an attempt to strengthen the rule, looting, and exploitation of the occupied areas in preparation for further conquering all of China and dominating the Far East. This new conspiracy has become more obvious this week. Here, we should repeat the conclusion of yesterday's editorial in this newspaper: "From this, it is already clear the importance of developing the rear battles of the × people in the occupied areas today! The importance of stepping up our efforts to combat anti-communist and peace fallacies and to combat all traitors, puppets, and the proactive pseudo-Central Committee such as Wang and others today! We should also understand the importance of stepping up national unity, stepping up national mobilization, and promoting political progress today!"</p>
<h3>Ten Warriors on the Western Front</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in Southeastern Shanxi, Di Ping</p>
<p>The city was in turmoil like a boiling pot. Merchants hurriedly closed their doors, and the common people dared not walk on the streets, daring not move, and huddled in the alleys.</p>
<p>The seventy-plus troops of the invaders in the City God Temple all panicked, carried out machine guns and swept across the south gate and the city wall, and the rest of the troops gathered at the north gate, planning to flee north.</p>
<p>The three warriors ran out of bombs, and one was injured. Not daring to linger, they jumped off the city and ran south with all their might, of course, taking the small paths, and sometimes even rolling in the ditches.</p>
<p>Enough guns were fired in the city, and reconnaissance was carried out everywhere. There were no guerrillas in the city. All the clothes of the common people were stripped off for inspection. Until dusk, the city was still filled with an atmosphere of terror.</p>
<p>In the evening, the invaders were even more apprehensive and guarded.</p>
<p>Six, The Common People Learn to Be Clever</p>
<p>The guerrillas are clever, and the common people are also learning to be clever.</p>
<p>The area less than twenty miles from the railway line is the demarcation line, and at the same time, it is the guerrilla war zone.</p>
<p>One night, there was no moonlight at all, and the night was as black as pitch. From the villages in the east, west, south, and north, several young farmers came out, carrying several empty kerosene cans and holding several grinding bags, quietly walking into the dark wilderness.</p>
<p>In a village where the invaders' army was stationed, on the small curved waist trees in the fields outside the village, and in the dense thicket of small cypress trees, they hung kerosene cans and loaded them with bundles of firecrackers and gunpowder, installed firecrackers of unequal lengths, and tore open long strings of firecrackers and hung them on the withered stalks at various important intersections.</p>
<p>After the work was completed, people from the east and west villages met in a small agreed-upon floating ditch, smoked a few bags of dry tobacco, and dispersed to go home to sleep.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, all was silent, and dense stars blinked their eyes. The dark wilderness hid humor and mystery.</p>
<p>East: Bang! Bang bang...</p>
<p>West: Bang! Bang bang...</p>
<p>South, north, all intersections sounded.</p>
<p>In the cypress forest: Boom! Snaps!</p>
<p>Why is the surrounding area full of gunfire?</p>
<p>The invaders, who never stood guard, panicked like rabbits frightened by a gunshot, and put on the pants of Hori's messed up trousers on the legs of the regular army.</p>
<p>The whole village was in turmoil. The invaders' troops were flustered and anxious, not knowing exactly what was going on. Machine guns were hurriedly set up, and the artillery horses were also stuffed into the shafts. All the baggage was loaded onto trucks.</p>
<p>The officer gave the order to resist desperately in the dark and take the opportunity to pull out at dawn.</p>
<p>The firecrackers outside the village continued to sound intermittently, and even got closer and closer. So the machine guns set up at the entrance of the village howled back to their hometowns like a gust of wind. The sound of gunfire outside never stopped, so the machine guns kept firing until dawn. In fact, they fought all night, and did not see any shadows. Before the east turned white, the sound of gunfire in the wilderness stopped.</p>
<p>When it got dark again, those few farmers went to retrieve the kerosene cans and swept up the ashes of the firecrackers.</p>
<p>A game is over. Men, women, old, and young in nearby villages are talking about this intense game war.</p>
<p>As for the residents of that occupied village, they are even more laughing for this game. (End)</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting Resumes in Northern Hubei, Our Troops Display Valor on the Shores of Dongting Lake</h3>
<p>【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 27th】 The battle situation on the 27th remained unchanged. The [enemy] who again invaded Suizhou, Dahong Mountain, and Xinji were severely struck by our forces, suffering nearly a thousand casualties. Fierce fighting continues in the vicinity. One of our units has cut off the [enemy]'s communication lines near Zhongxiang. In the battle on the shores of Dongting Lake in Northern Hunan, we hold the advantage. The continuous mountains and lakes in the area provide our guerrilla forces with ideal cover, posing a significant threat to the [enemy].</p>
<p>【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 27th】 In the past ten days, our guerrillas have approached the outskirts of Guangzhou three times, eliminating many [enemy] troops.</p>
<p>【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 27th】 According to reports, our troops attacking Jinan have safely withdrawn. However, the [enemy] remains on guard day and night. Jinan city is alarmed multiple times a day. One of our units besieged Anqiu County, an important stronghold of the [enemy] in Eastern Shandong, and approached the city walls by the 24th, commencing the assault. A portion of our troops entered the city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the [enemy]. The [enemy] within the city numbers only three hundred and is on the verge of annihilation. Over a hundred [enemy] troops in the nearby Mount Mou Pseudo-Village were completely wiped out.</p>
<p>The Fierce Battle in Northern Hubei in Detail 【Central News Agency Dispatch from Suixian, 26th】 Regarding the situation in Central Hubei, the [enemy] and our troops have been facing off on the Suixian-Jingshan line for six months. At the beginning of this year, the [enemy] intended to capture Xiangfan and control Jingyi, advancing westward from Jingzhong and Hanyi in two directions. After occupying Xiushui and Jiukou, they were suppressed by our main forces in the Suijun area, unable to cross the river and advance west. The Suizao troops also launched an offensive last month, pressing towards Wuhan and threatening the city. The [enemy], left with no other choice, changed their strategy, concentrating all of their Central Hubei forces in Northern Hubei, attempting to encircle and annihilate our Suizao main force. As a result, the [enemy] deployed the 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions, as well as a cavalry brigade, along with hundreds of heavy artillery pieces and several squadrons of aircraft, to attack our left flank along the Suizao three routes, one along the Xianghua Road, one from Dahekou, and one northwards along the Xiang River from Zhongxiang. The [enemy] facing Suizao was met head-on and fiercely attacked by one of our units, preventing their success. The [enemy] in the Tianhekou area were also heavily damaged by our forces. They then moved from Zhongxiang, scurrying north towards the border, and spreading to areas like Xinye and Tanghe, attempting a large-scale encirclement to cut off our rear. Our forces had long detected their plot. On one hand, they bravely resisted along multiple routes, and on the other hand, they shifted positions. After fighting for over ten days, the [enemy] suffered heavy casualties. Their bodies were scattered in the valleys and wheat fields along the roads, totaling no fewer than two to three thousand. Subsequently, our forces deployed significant forces at Dahong Mountain and Tongbai, cutting off the [enemy]'s rear. At the same time, troops from all directions, including Zhongxiang, Eastern Hubei, and Southern Henan, encircled the [enemy] who had broken into Suizao. Our main force also launched a fierce counterattack. The [enemy], with unstable footing, heavy casualties, and deep in the mire, coupled with cut-off food supplies and no resources to plunder in the wild, began setting fire to the cities of Suizao on the 17th and retreated fiercely towards Anlu and Yingshan, leaving corpses scattered along the way, and abandoning many wounded soldiers, supplies, horses. The [enemy]'s plan to encircle and annihilate our forces ultimately failed. As a result, the two county towns of Suizao were successively recovered on the 18th and 19th. It was determined that in this campaign, the [enemy] relied on the most stubborn 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions as their main force, rushing around wildly with great ferocity. However, the result was over 20,000 casualties. Although we suffered considerable sacrifices, we achieved the goal of attrition warfare and inflicted significant damage on the [enemy], shattering their scheme of encirclement and annihilation. This is truly a great victory in our second phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Defeating the [Enemy] North of the Xinqiang River 【Central News Agency Dispatch from Guilin, 27th, 2:00 PM】 On the 25th, the [enemy] again advanced in two columns, each with three hundred troops, towards our Tangjiapai head position, launching an attack on the stronghold. After our counterattack, the [enemy] suffered significant damage. The [enemy] at the river mouth was repelled. The [enemy] at Tangjiapai head is still engaged in fierce fighting with our troops.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Miluo, 27th】 On the 26th, the [enemy] advanced on Kou (10 kilometers northeast of Xinqiang) and Yanjiadashan (6 kilometers northwest of Xinqiang), with six to seven hundred troops each. After our separate counterattacks, by noon on the 27th, in the Kou area, one of our divisions dispatched a capable force to circle around to the [enemy]'s rear from the foot of Mount Dayun, launching a two-pronged attack with our troops at the front. The [enemy] suffered over 400 casualties and retreated to Wujiang Bridge. At present, our troops in Kou have joined forces with the units that entered the [enemy]'s rear, and are pursuing that [enemy] force. In the Yanjiadashan area, the [enemy], repeatedly frustrated in their attacks, switched to defending their strongholds on the 27th, only occasionally using artillery to shell our positions aimlessly, hoping to impede our troops' advance.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Changde, 27th】 Frontline reports indicate that the [enemy] troops in Yueyang have been increasing in numbers in the past two days. The [enemy] in Xitang once launched a fierce attack on us yesterday, immediately resulting in intense fighting. After a long stalemate, our position remained unmoved. The [enemy], unable to succeed, ceased their attack and retreated to that area.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Changde, 27th】 Huarong telephone report: At noon on the 25th, four [enemy] small motorboats sailed from Yueyang to the vicinity of Qiganzui along the shore of Dongting Lake, attempting to land. They were discovered by our defending troops, who immediately opened fire fiercely. The [enemy] used machine guns for cover and fled backwards.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Warfare on the Nanxun Line 【Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Location, 26th】 Our certain guerrilla unit, after transforming from a lone force in Mount Lu, has mostly gathered in the Minshan Mountains, establishing close ties with the existing troops in the mountains. Their momentum is even greater than before, and they frequently attack the [enemy] on the Nanxun Line. The [enemy] army considers them a thorn in their side and has attempted to encircle and attack them, but they have suffered heavy losses. Starting on the morning of the 21st, the [enemy] again gathered over eight hundred of their remaining troops, along with over ten artillery pieces, and launched a fierce attack on Lingshangwang, an important stronghold in the Minshan Mountains, in three routes. One route, with approximately four hundred [enemy] troops, attacked Chenzhuang and Dielong from Heliyu, attacking the east of Lingshangwang. Another route, with over two hundred [enemy] troops,迂迴ed around the Minshan Mountains, attacking the north of Lingshangwang. Another route, with approximately two hundred [enemy] troops, attacked the south of Lingshangwang from Pingfeng. Their artillery was deployed in the Xiaoyangpu and Quanshui Cave area, concentrating firepower to bombard Lingshangwang fiercely, firing over a thousand rounds, to provide cover for the [enemy] infantry's advance. The certain battalion commander of our unit commanded his troops to counterattack separately. After fierce fighting for over an hour, the [enemy]'s artillery fire was too intense, causing both the Dawulong and Chenzhuang lines of defense to be broken through. Our troops retreated to the positions near Lingshangwang, resisting strongly. Fierce fighting continued until noon, with over ten hand-to-hand combats. One of our companies suffered relatively heavy casualties and retreated again to the Jinpangu Temple position, the highest peak of the Minshan Mountains. The [enemy] continued their fierce assault, but we relied on the advantageous terrain and our soldiers fought bravely, with one soldier acting as a hundred, holding out until night. The [enemy] ultimately failed to succeed. A certain general commander of our unit urgently deployed certain two battalions, and coordinated with the Jiuduan De'an people's self-defense force, leading them personally, rushing to their aid overnight, and using the strategy of besieging Wei to rescue Zhao, launching fierce attacks on the [enemy]'s rear in Heliyu, Huanglaomen, Mahuiling, and Daoshimen in four routes. At the same time, our troops trapped in Jinpangu Temple also seized the opportunity to counterattack. The [enemy]'s forces were attacked from the back and front, and gradually became unable to withstand the pressure, collapsing and retreating. By noon on the 22nd, after bloody battles, we finally recovered the stronghold of Lingshangwang, and then took advantage of the momentum to pursue and kill, with the remaining [enemy] fleeing back to Heliyu, Jigongling, and other places. The fierceness of this battle can be said to be unprecedented. Our loyal and brave generals, neither eating nor drinking, bathed themselves in artillery fire for two days and nights, and finally made the stubborn [enemy] submit. It is estimated that over a hundred [enemy] troops were killed or wounded, and one light machine gun, dozens of rifles, and countless other war materials were seized. We also suffered over thirty casualties of officers and soldiers.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Serious Stance Rejects the [Enemy]'s Demands, Negotiations Conclude</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 26th】 Shanghai dispatch: Regarding the concession issue, the Municipal Council believes that negotiations on the various demands put forward by the Japanese side have come to an end. At present, the Municipal Council's attitude towards negotiations with the Japanese side is extremely serious. The Municipal Council resolutely refuses to accept the demands put forward by the Japanese side that violate the land regulations and the agreements signed with the National Government. The reason is that the land regulations and the agreements signed by the concession and the National Government were signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries with the National Government. The Municipal Council has no right to refuse or agree to them. Therefore, regarding the demands put forward by the Japanese side that involve the above two items, the Municipal Council will only report them to the consular body, and the Japanese side should directly negotiate with the governments of various countries. The Municipal Council's reply to the demands put forward by the Japanese side is also based on the above principles, it is said.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shooting Case</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Shanghai dispatch: At 7:30 AM on the 27th, a shooting occurred in room 122 of the Hubei Andong Hotel in the Public Concession. A Hubei native named Xu Zhifu was shot once in the waist and once in the chest, dying from his injuries. Another Yangzhong County native named Gu Tianming was shot once in the right arm. The two shooters fled after achieving their objective. According to investigations, Gu confessed to being the section chief of the pseudo-Yangzhong County government, and Xu was a silk cocoon merchant. They came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang four days ago to negotiate a transaction. As for the reason for the killing, it is speculated that it was due to a dispute over business.</p>
<p>Our Attack on Wusong</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Shanghai dispatch: Our guerrilla teams in the suburbs of Baoshan have been advancing towards Wusong for days. It is heard that our troops encountered the [enemy] garrison on the evening of the 25th. Our large units arrived at night and joined the battle. The [enemy] is currently constructing fortifications in the city and along the river to prevent a major battle from breaking out. On the 26th, all trains between Shanghai and Songjiang were suspended, while trains carrying large numbers of [enemy] troops were sent to Wusong as reinforcements.</p>
<h3>The [Enemy]'s Blockade of Our Coastline, the United Kingdom and France Maintain a Consistent Attitude, the French Government Instructs Commander Douke to Protest Strongly Against the Interception of French Mail, the US Authorities Are Also Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Paris, 27th】 The French government has ordered its commander of the Asian fleet to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese side regarding the Japanese side's order for the French ship "Alinmeier" to stop sailing. The French government is studying the Japanese side's blockade of the Chinese coast, and the final attitude will be decided in consultation with the United Kingdom. It is heard that the United Kingdom has decided to safeguard its rights.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 25th】 The State Department is closely monitoring the attitude of the Japanese Navy towards foreign merchant ships on the Chinese coast. So far, no American merchant ships have been intercepted. According to observations from people close to the State Department, the government will still closely monitor the development of the situation. However, it is not convenient to come forward to participate in the retaliatory measures taken by the United Kingdom and France for the time being. As far as Japan's implementation of the blockade of the Chinese coast is concerned, the State Department has not received any credible information. It is rumored that the British government has consulted with the United States on countermeasures, which is also not true.</p>
<h3>Gulangyu Negotiations, the Four-Nation Naval Conference Fails, Future Negotiations to be Handled by the Consular Corps</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Shanghai external dispatch: According to the US naval authorities here, the four-nation naval conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan in Gulangyu ended without result, and will probably be handled by the diplomatic representatives of each country. The Domei News Agency's Tokyo dispatch severely criticized the conference, denouncing it as "fraudulent", its purpose being to shift the responsibility for the stalemate in the negotiations to the consular corps.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 Tokyo external dispatch: According to Xiamen Japanese sources, the Japanese Consul General Uchida visited Hockert, the acting Director-General of the Municipal Council, yesterday to exchange views on ways to ease the situation in Gulangyu, paying particular attention to the five demands for reform of the Municipal Council put forward by the Japanese side. Hockert promised to submit a reply within a few days after consulting with the directors.</p>
<h3>Our Negotiations with British Business Circles on the Use of Loans, Totaling 3 Million Pounds, to Purchase Military Supplies and Rolling Stock</h3>
<p>【Haitong News Agency Dispatch from London, 27th】 The British government recently loaned 3 million British pounds to the National Government of China. The Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom and British business circles have recently been discussing the issue of the allocation of the loan. According to the British Parliament, the British government has been authorized to loan 10 million pounds to foreign governments, and must obtain a special permit from Parliament. The above-mentioned 3 million pounds is allocated from the 10 million pounds. Any losses suffered by British business circles in trade with China can be compensated for. British commercial firms will export various commodities to China, especially military supplies and military vehicles, which will account for the majority. In the future, if there are any losses, the British government will bear 75%. According to private estimates, 30% of the loan, or 900,000 pounds, has already been utilized.</p>
<h3>Southern Fujian, Haicheng, Auctioning of Plaques, Buyers are Very Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Yong'an, 26th】 Haicheng County in Southern Fujian has recently promoted an auction movement. The New Life Movement Association has specially initiated the auction of plaques. The method is to have local party, government, military, and social leaders write plaques and invite major clan groups to purchase them through voluntary donations. Elders of each clan have stated that because of the brutal invasion by the [enemy], the ancestral graves and temples of our ancestors have also been ravaged, which is the greatest shame for all descendants of Yan and Huang. This move is to report to the nation, bring honor to the clan, and the ancestral halls of each clan mostly still have property. By gathering strength, the capacity of resisting the enemy may be enhanced, which is easy to achieve. Therefore, they are enthusiastically supporting it. Currently, over thirty clans in the county have registered to purchase ancestral halls. One plaque, with the highest price of one thousand yuan, has already raised 17,700 yuan. If this move can be promoted nationwide, tens of millions of dollars can be easily raised, which will be beneficial to the War of Resistance, nothing could be better. It also serves as a way for the elders and gentry in various places to repay the nation and protect their homes both spiritually and materially.</p>
<h3>The Plunge of the Japanese Yen is Difficult to Reverse, the [Enemy]'s Economic Straits are Fully Exposed</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 26th】 Shanghai dispatch: Due to runaway inflation, the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai has plummeted, once tragically falling to 88 cents (i.e., 100 Japanese yen is only equivalent to 88 yuan of Chinese currency). The [enemy] authorities in Shanghai are urgently seeking remedies and ordered the puppet Huaxing Bank to make large purchases, causing the price to rise from 88 yuan to 93 yuan, reaching a high rate of 997 yuan. However, the puppet bank then stopped purchasing, and by noon on the 26th, it had fallen back to 94 yuan and 20 cents. At the same time, the puppet currency of Special Xing also fell to 155 yuan before it could be exchanged for 100 yuan of legal tender. The number of [enemy] banknotes in Shanghai has never been accurately accounted for. Previously, there were only 10 million yuan, but according to reliable investigations, it has reached as much as 50 million to 100 million yuan. The number of banknotes issued in [enemy] territory has also increased dramatically. According to statistics, the amount of [enemy] currency in circulation in January 1937 was only 1.5 billion yen, but by the end of last year, it had increased to 2.5 billion yen, and now it has increased to 2.9 billion yen. Regarding the exchange rate between the [enemy] currency and the legal tender, between June and July of last year, it was 130 yuan of legal tender for 100 yen of [enemy] currency, and in September it was 120 yuan. In May of this year, it fell to par, and has since continued to decline, becoming the current situation. According to financial observers, the [enemy] has no way to reverse the runaway inflation. The price of the [enemy] currency will continue to decline and become more volatile, and the economic exhaustion of the [enemy] is now fully exposed. It can be seen that the period of being mired in economic troubles is approaching.</p>
<p>【Reuters Dispatch from Shanghai, 27th】 This morning, the Japanese yen showed a slight improvement. The market price for purchases was 97 cents of Chinese currency per Japanese yen, an increase of two cents compared to yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Two Kinds of Puppet Currency Divided by the River 【Shanghai Correspondence】 The members of the Investigation Committee organized by the puppet "United Reserve Bank" and the liaison department of the Japanese Koa-in will come to Shanghai soon to discuss the cooperation between the "Lianhua" currency and the new "Hongkou" currency with the newly established puppet "Huaxing Commercial Bank." According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, a Tokyo-based news organization, the puppet regimes in Beiping and Nanjing have agreed in principle that the two puppet currencies should be interconnected at a fixed ratio, but both currencies should maintain a fixed and non-excessive transitional area. The Japanese financial community expects that the circulation areas of the two puppet currencies will be divided along the Yellow River, with the "Lianzhun" currency circulating north of the river and the "Hongkou" currency circulating south of the river.</p>
<h3>Remembering Zhongshan Taide (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>A Pioneer Among Anti-War Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>It was around mid-April that Battalion Commander Yang sent someone to escort Zhongshan to see General Fan Songfu. General Fan had already begun commanding his troops, entering the triangular area of ​​Wuchang, Xianning, and Yangxin in northern Jiangxi and Hunan, attacking the flanks and rears of the Japanese army at any time and place. They walked for eight days, finally meeting Fan in the dense forests between Xiushui and Tongshan. Li Panhou, the chief of staff of Fan's troops, and Lei Zhen, a staff officer who was a student at Japan University, treated him very well, and he was very grateful.</p>
<p>He took out a stack of inscriptions from his small bag and handed me two of them. He smiled and wrote with a pencil on a notepad: "General Fan Songfu wrote it for me after inviting me to drink." The first one read:</p>
<p>"Vast is the universe, boundless are the mountains and rivers. Striving for cities and seizing land, how long does human life last?!</p>
<p>May your family be harmonious, and may you find joy in your wife and children. Enjoy yourself and maintain heavenly harmony.</p>
<p>To my friend Zhongshan, From Fan Songfu, in ancient style"</p>
<p>Another one was given to him by the commander of the 4th Security Regiment, which read:</p>
<p>"Understanding the [enemy]'s aggressive nature is wisdom; not participating in blind wars is benevolence; resolutely leaving one's home country is courage. Friend, you are a pioneer of the god of peace, a foreseer of the Japanese people, and we have infinite respect for you. From now on, let us work together to make the Japanese military clique realize their mistakes and change their ambitions. Then their achievement will be paramount."</p>
<p>I asked him about his impressions of the Sino-Japanese War. He also said, "Last month, in the headquarters of General Fan Songdong, I wrote a 'Reflection' in Japanese, but only those who can read Japanese can understand it. That night, I translated it into my rough Chinese under the moonlight, but I always felt that it didn't express my meaning well."</p>
<p>The "Reflection" was written sloppily on maobian paper with a brush:</p>
<p>"Today's war between China and Japan is the realization of a dream—that is, the continental policy of Japanese capitalism. Their government uses the beautiful words 'loyalty to the emperor and love for the country' for false propaganda to manipulate the people. Starting an aggressive war is a blind policy in which we brothers go to our deaths for nothing. The military and capitalists tell us, 'Our national life is guaranteed only by peace in the East,' but our comrades' experiences are completely the opposite. If we really want peace in the East, can we achieve it by killing indiscriminately in this way? We have become running dogs of the invaders. Even if we die in battle, peace will not be achieved. The high officials of the military receive gold badges and are smug; the financial cliques are making profits because of the war, and their pockets are full. We so-called 'noble sacrifices' are giving our lives in vain. We comrades, for the sake of the country, for the sake of our families, and for the sake of opening ourselves up, must overthrow the violent military and financial cliques. Let us unite and launch a movement against aggression."—April 22.</p>
<p>When asked about his life in the army, he said that it was much worse than when he first came to China. His monthly salary was 180 Japanese yen. When spending money in China, he had to exchange it for military notes first. In this way, it was as if he was returning his salary to the military and financial cliques again. What was even more painful was the situation of the Chinese people in the occupied areas, who could only exchange the products they had obtained with blood and sweat for worthless military notes. In the occupied areas, even a regimental commander could issue banknotes, print them on any piece of paper, stamp them with a private seal, and force the Chinese people to use them. This is something that no country in the world could think of, but the Japanese warlords did. He had been fighting in China for about eight months and had accumulated savings of 1,625 Japanese yen, which he had remitted to his old mother before he fled.</p>
<p>Because he was a trainee officer in the staff department, he knew the situation of the Japanese army in southern Hubei and northern Hunan very clearly. He made a report of about 50,000 words to the staff office of the commander. (This reporter had the privilege of reading it first, but it cannot be published for the time being because it concerns military secrets.) Zhongshan believed that our country's destruction of roads to hinder the advance of the Japanese army had gradually succeeded. He believed that Chinese regular troops should penetrate as deeply as possible into the rear of the Japanese army; Chinese spies should establish closer relations with various puppet organizations in the Japanese-occupied areas to scout out the [enemy]'s situation and assist the work of the national army. He also said: "The anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers has already gone from ideological to action. I hope to organize them in battle. China is not far from winning the war against Japan, whether militarily, politically, or economically."</p>
<p>When we shook hands to say goodbye, the reporter told him that he might be able to go to the rear in Guilin to rest for a while in the next few days. He asked, "How many miles is it from Changsha to Guilin?" He was very happy that he could travel by car and train because he had sores on his feet and had difficulty walking.</p>
<p>The press in Changsha is preparing to convene a large welcome meeting for the arrival of Zhongshan Taide with the cultural circles in Changsha in the coming days. May 15, in Changsha.</p>

<h3>Losses of [Enemy] Aircraft in Raids on Chongqing, the [Enemy] Admits to the Recent Loss of One Aircraft, Two Majors, Naito and Masuda, and Others Were Executed</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 6th】 External dispatch from Shanghai: A Japanese naval spokesman admitted today that one [enemy] aircraft was lost during the [enemy] air raid on Chongqing on the evening of the 25th. It is said that a total of two batches of [enemy] aircraft raided Chongqing that day, the first batch with 30 aircraft and the second batch with 15 aircraft. Chinese anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce, and one [enemy] aircraft was shot down, it is said.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th】 According to reliable information, regarding the aerial attacks launched by Lieutenant Colonel Okuda Kikuji of the [enemy] Naval Air Corps, which targeted our Hengyang, Changsha, Zhijiang, Kunming, Yushan, and Guixi urban areas with ground attack aircraft commanded by Majors Naito Koka and Masuda Dan of the [enemy] squadrons on the 4th, 5th, 8th, and 10th, the indiscriminate use of incendiary bombs on our undefended urban areas served only to strengthen the anti-war sentiment among our rear areas' population. Later, on the 3rd, 4th, and 12th, they launched a series of attacks that heavily bombed the downtown area of Chongqing. The bombing has also affected diplomatic missions and other friendly entities, causing the condemnation of international entities. According to news released by the [enemy] after the incident on the 3rd, two [enemy] aircraft shot down by our troops over Chongqing airspace were the leading aircraft of the first squadron and the second squadron piloted by Majors Naito and Masuda, respectively. Killed were a total of fourteen men including Majors Naito and Masuda, and Petty Officers Ishii and Kanemoto, [enemy] pilots executed. Listeners rejoiced. Majors Naito and Masuda, both 36 years old this year, graduated from the [enemy]'s Naval Aviation School. They served as ensign candidates in July of Taisho 13, and were commissioned as ensigns in December of Taisho 14. They were appointed as lieutenants in December of Showa 2 and captains in December of Showa 5, and were promoted to majors after the war. They were among the few long-distance aviators and mechanical talents in the [enemy] navy. Now that they have all died in battle, it is a great loss for the [enemy].</p>
<p>【Associated Press Dispatch from Chongqing, 27th】 According to an officer on the American ship U.S.S Tutuila anchored off the south bank of Chongqing who spoke to a reporter from this agency, he saw a Japanese plane being shot down the other day during the bombing of Chongqing. After the Japanese planes finished bombing Chongqing, they also dropped multiple bombs on Chinese airfields, but did not damage any Chinese planes on the ground. At that time, the ship's officers saw a [enemy] aircraft flying towards the ship, seemingly with the intention of attacking. They ordered all officers and soldiers to prepare their guns for defense, and they would fire back if the [enemy] aircraft charged down to bomb them. However, since the Japanese heavy bombers were from Hankou, they could not carry out a bombing operation. Therefore, the American ship's officers did not expect them to attack. A bomb was also dropped on the foreign-run wounded soldier transport station in Chongqing, destroying the entire building, but all the staff were safe.</p>
<h3>Returning from Inspecting the Jiangnan Guerrilla Areas: Zhou Enlai Discusses the New Situation (Part 1) Organizing the Masses After × to Launch a National Combat Turning × into the Frontline, Crushing Economic Conspiracies</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 22nd Dispatch] According to an Associated Press report, General Zhou Enlai, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission, recently returned from inspecting the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. In a conversation with visitors, he stated, "Our country's strategy lies in utilizing manpower and material resources to contend with the Japanese ×, so that Japan's strategy of conquering China cannot be realized." The Japanese × have not yet changed their fundamental policy of subjugating our country, nor have they changed their determination to eliminate the interests of foreigners in China.</p>
<p>× Military Strategy According to Zhou, "The new policy of the Japanese × has the support of Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Japanese financiers and bankers. The purpose of this policy is to eliminate the Chinese resistance forces in their occupied areas and to advance further when the opportunity arises." Currently, 85% of the Japanese army in China is engaged in clearing up the rear areas. Therefore, in the past two months, the Japanese army has only launched two large-scale battles. However, this strategy of the Japanese side has not been successful. Generally speaking, we have been able to maintain our existing positions and have also dispatched a large number of regular troops to the rear of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Our Military Strategy Our strategy is to launch guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Japanese army. Many people believe that this tactic has not developed much to date, but in fact, it has made considerable progress. Our goal is to establish multiple operational bases in the rear of the Japanese army to deplete × people's strength and to thwart the Japanese attempts to exploit Chinese resources to replenish the depleted Japanese economy. After the establishment of these guerrilla military bases, the × army has found it difficult to cope and has been unable to advance. As a result, we have greater freedom. These guerrilla warfare military bases are not only established in mountainous areas, such as the Wutai Mountains in Shanxi Province, but also on plains. For example, in the plain area near Wuhu, 55 miles wide and 75 miles long, they have managed to tie down the strength of an entire Japanese division. The Japanese army in that area has been forced to build countless fortifications around it. The Japanese army tied down in the Wutai Mountains amounts to as many as 50,000 men. The Japanese side has launched four sieges against this area, but all have failed. A small team of plain guerrillas can kill about ten Japanese soldiers every day. If each area kills 100 Japanese soldiers every day, then if 100 such bases can be established, 360,000 Japanese soldiers can be killed each year.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Council Passes Resolution on Aid to China, Invites United States to Intensify Assistance Far East Situation is Developing</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 27th] The League of Nations Council held a meeting this morning and passed a resolution on assisting China in its resistance against Japan. It invited the United States to intensify all possible assistance to China. The resolution also suggested that the diplomatic representatives of member states submit reports on the indiscriminate bombing of innocent people. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo expressed dissatisfaction with the resolution, but indicated that he would accept it on the condition that this issue would still be included on the agenda at the next meeting. Koo had requested a collective boycott of the transport of aircraft and oil to Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 26th] The League of Nations Council is scheduled to hold a public meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow to pass a resolution on the application submitted by China. In addition, regarding the issue of fortifying the Aaland Islands in the Baltic Sea, after the Soviet government requested an extension for discussion, the rapporteur for the case, Belgian representative Mr. Ergin, suggested to the Council that it temporarily adjourn for two or three weeks to allow Sweden and Finland to conduct direct negotiations with the Soviet Union. The meeting would then be reconvened.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union opposes the fortification of the Aaland Islands (which belong to Finland in the northeastern part of the Baltic Sea and are closest to Swedish territorial waters). Britain and France are both willing to back the Soviet Union. According to the British and French mutual assistance plan, the two countries intend to ask the Soviet Union to find a way to blockade German shipping in the Baltic Sea, so that the German navy will be busy defending itself in the Baltic Sea. As for the Soviet Union, it believes that if the Aaland Islands are fortified, they will be occupied by Germany in the event of war, making it impossible for the Soviet Baltic Fleet to operate.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] According to opinions in political circles here, after the conclusion of the alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the three countries will adopt a more active policy in the Far East. This alliance strengthens the Soviet Union's position in Europe and allows it to implement a forward policy on its eastern border. It is widely believed that the war materials that the Soviet Union transports to China via Xinjiang will soon increase substantially. Britain will also adopt a tougher Far East policy after the situation in Europe clarifies. Political circles here believe that the recent landing of British, American, and French sailors in Gulangyu is sufficient to indicate the future trend of development.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in German Industrial Raw Material Production Increased Burden of Transportation After Annexing Three Regions of Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] According to the report of the economic investigation agency for the first three months of this year, German industry is currently facing serious problems in terms of labor, raw materials, and transportation. The number of laborers has exceeded 21 million, but the working hours of workers in the construction, mining, and agricultural industries have also been extended. In terms of raw materials, domestic production has difficulties in both quantity and form. Although iron ore has been mined, it cannot be used to manufacture the most in-demand steel due to its sulfur content. Since Germany strengthened the Western Wall and annexed the Sudetenland, Bohemia, and Moravia, the burden of transportation has increased even more. It is rumored that the production volume of various industries has "increased, but this progress has been achieved through great effort and huge expense."</p>
<h3>Polish Ambassador to Britain Returned to London Day Before Yesterday</h3>

Political circles here expect that Voroshilov will accept the British government's invitation and come to London to observe the British Army's grand exercises in September. Political circles also believe that this move is sufficient to indicate that the new plan that the British government sent to the Soviet Union yesterday must have been accepted by the Soviet side, and there will not be any further difficulties in terms of details.</p>

<h3>US House to Pass Neutrality Act Amendment</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Hull today discussed the issue of American neutrality with several congressmen from both parties for two hours. Afterwards, Congressmen Saul and Bloom told people that, according to their predictions, the House of Representatives will pass a bill in the next few weeks with the following contents: (1) Abolish the old regulations regarding the transportation of munitions and the embargo on munitions; (2) Grant the president the power to designate "dangerous areas" in order to prohibit ships from sailing to those areas; (3) Prohibit loans to belligerent countries; (4) Retain control over the export of munitions, in a way that requires ownership to be transferred before the munitions are exported at American ports. Bloom also stated that the committee on this matter had also been studying a similar bill in the past few weeks. For the convenience of discussion, a separate printed copy of the bill has been made as a blueprint for the members to study. Some people also believe that Hull's determination to ask the House of Representatives to pass a bill is quite firm, because the American government has the strongest influence in the House of Representatives. As for the Senate, there is also a bill proposed by Senator Key Pittman. Key Pittman admitted that the motivation for proposing the bill was also influenced by the State Department. It is said that Hull's main goal is to abolish the embargo on munitions. Key Pittman's bill also has the same suggestion, but Hull himself prefers the bill in the House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>Germany's Plot for Danzig More Urgent Hitler Instructs Anti-Polish Policy Propaganda to Abolish Polish-Danzig Agreements</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 25th] Well-informed sources here have announced that German leader Hitler has already decided on a policy for the issue of the city of Danzig, that is, in the next few months, arrangements should be made in both political and spiritual aspects, and then action should be taken once the opportunity is ripe. Yesterday, when he met with Forster, the leader of the National Socialist Party in the Free City of Danzig, in Berlin, he personally gave instructions on the policies that the National Socialist Party should implement in the city. It is rumored that his intention is to announce the abolition of all agreements signed between Poland and the city of Danzig after August 15, 1933. In addition, the leader also ordered the promotion of the following measures: (1) Actively boycott shops and companies established by Poles in the city; (2) Danzig newspapers should attack Poland and accuse it of hindering normal traffic between the city and the German province of Pomerania. All these instructions have been secretly implemented after Forster returned to the city of Danzig today. For example, the National Socialist Party organ, the Danziger Vorposten newspaper, began to comment today on the agreement of August 15, 1933, and blamed Poland for not fulfilling its treaty obligations, advocating that it be abolished. Such promotion is worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Adjusts Taxes</h3>
<p>According to reports, Guangdong Province is working hard to adjust taxes throughout the province to meet current needs, and is formulating wartime tax rules, with a focus on "increasing military reserves, fostering civil power, and considering both." This is a very noteworthy event.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese × began a large-scale invasion of South China last October, the tax revenue in the Guangzhou area, which used to be a major source of tax revenue for Guangdong Province, has been cut off. The central area and Hainan Island have also successively become war zones, and tax collection has mostly stopped. In addition, the current tax rules in Guangdong Province were all formulated before the war, and they are not fully suitable for the needs of the current situation and environment. Such a modification is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>As for the principle of "increasing military preparedness and fostering civil power while considering both," it is also in line with the program of resisting the war and building the country. However, in terms of specific regulations and implementation methods, we believe that two points still need to be paid attention to: first, in terms of new tax regulations, we should absolutely abide by the program of resisting the war and building the country, and refer to the resolutions of the third National Political Council, on the one hand, increasing inheritance tax and effectively implementing income tax with progressive taxation, and on the other hand, not forgetting to support production and construction enterprises to increase new tax sources. What is particularly important is to abolish the remaining exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies as much as possible, reduce the burden on farmers, businessmen, and workers, and clear the obstacles to tax collection. Second, in terms of implementation methods, it is necessary to effectively eliminate the remaining corrupt elements and all malpractices, promote a style of work that is not afraid of hardship, is honest, and is devoted to public service, and promote young talents with ability, accomplishment, and integrity as much as possible. The propaganda and explanation work of "those with money contribute iron, jointly save the country from disaster" should also be carried out in conjunction.</p>
<h3>Taixian County Children's Brigade</h3>
<p>Since the war of resistance, Chinese children and teenagers have also grown up under the baptism of × people's artillery fire, shouldering the arduous task of resisting Japan and saving the country, and working hard for the construction of the country. Among them, the achievements of the Boy Scouts, children's theater troupes, the Xin'an Brigade, and the Young Pioneers and Children's Service Corps in various battlefields in North China are particularly praised by the whole country.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Taixian County Children's Brigade in Jiangsu Province, in order to expand the children's organization and mobilize the children of the entire county to participate in the war of resistance, convened the first symposium of children from various schools and private schools on the 10th of this month. At that time, it was decided to hold a meeting every week, publish a joint declaration of children in the county, and promote singing movements. Regarding the patriotic spirit and efforts of children in the rear of the × army, everyone, think about it calmly, can you not blush with shame?</p>
<p>We primary school teachers who are companions with children every day, seeing the participation of children everywhere in the work of resisting the war and building the country, ××××××××! We cannot personally go to the front lines and occupied areas to work, but we should also care about the lives of our students and family children, who are the future masters of our country! Uncle Di</p>
<h3>The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>[London Correspondence] In the three years since the alliance of the German, Japanese, and Italian aggressor groups, especially in the two years since China began its resistance, we can broadly summarize that the direction in which the fate of the world and the future of the Far East are heading has been consistent and unwavering. The only event that could have potentially changed their course, the only attempt to rewrite history, was undoubtedly the "line" of the current British "Chamberlain Cabinet" that formally appeared on the world stage since last spring. However, this line had completely failed by the beginning of this year, on the eve of Prime Minister Chamberlain's famous "Birmingham Speech." Subsequently, when the British government decided to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union, the current British cabinet had taken a big detour, only to return to its original starting point. What is most interesting is that the individuals in charge of this detour have remained unchanged from beginning to end. What makes us feel uneasy is the thought of the long list of weak nations and countries, such as Austria, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Albania, who have become their victims. Therefore, when the British government turned around and made promises to guarantee the independence of small countries in Eastern and Southern Europe, it meant that British diplomacy had returned to its starting point a year ago, embarking on the right path anew.</p>
<p>Whether this second departure will once again lead astray, we still cannot say for sure. However, there is another point that we can confidently predict. If the first attempt yielded nothing but sacrifice, then even if there is a second attempt, the result will undoubtedly be a complete failure. The difference is that if, unfortunately, there is indeed a second attempt, then the sacrifice will be much greater than the first time. And after this time, whether there will still be an opportunity for Britain to return to its original starting point and try again is highly questionable. Summarizing the evolution of the past year, even now, we can say that the steadfastness of the Soviet Union and the United States, coupled with the great struggle of our China, are the three pillars that have supported the overall global situation for the past year. Therefore, even today, Britain and France still have the opportunity to return to the right path and salvage the fate of their empires.</p>
<p>Based on the current global situation, the first major event is:</p>
<p>(1) The ongoing cooperation negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>First and foremost, there is the issue of the foundation of this cooperation. The notion that Britain and the Soviet Union are opposed to each other has long been common knowledge. Now, if we are to talk about cooperation, what is its foundation? First, since the Soviet Union abandoned the "world revolution" line, the transformation of social systems has generally become the internal affair of each country. Second, after the failure of British intervention in the Soviet social revolution, it has adopted an enlightened policy not only towards the Soviet Union but also towards its own socialist tendencies and parties. Third, the threat posed by the Axis powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy is common to both Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In accordance with this foundation, cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union can be established under the forms of an "anti-aggression front" or a "peace front."</p>
<p>However, apart from this, there is another very important point, which is the subjective awareness and determination of both Britain and the Soviet Union. Currently, there is a major divergence here, which is that Britain, in order to maintain its current imperial content and scope, is using any means to avoid war. As for the Soviet Union, its consistent foreign policy over the years has been to avoid provoking the formation of a fascist anti-communist crusade. However, on the other hand, in order to completely eliminate the threat to the only socialist country, it is ready at any time to join hands with any large-scale international anti-aggression group to fight together. Although the establishment of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union does not necessarily mean that war will break out, before it is established, there must be at least such a minimum understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union as a prerequisite: the ultimate goal of cooperation is to maintain peace. However, when peaceful means of restraint are ineffective, each must have the automatic determination to fight at all costs. Extending from this, the inevitable conclusions are: (1) Britain must abandon the illusion of breaking up the German, Japanese, and Italian alliance, and (2) abandon the only secret of satisfying aggressor nations and avoiding major wars by sacrificing small nations and countries. And (3) this spirit of cooperative resistance must be thoroughly disseminated throughout the world.</p>
<p>The fundamental awareness described above has not yet matured in the current situation in Britain. However, the general trend is indeed moving towards maturity.</p>

<p>[Reuters Ottawa, 26th] The King's visit to Canada has been met with enthusiastic welcomes everywhere. The affection of the public has been so profound that it exceeded expectations. The King is amiable and approachable, acting in a commoner manner, often changing the predetermined schedule to accommodate the public's welcome. When the King's train passed through the Canadian wilderness, he did not stay in the carriage according to the original schedule but personally got out of the train to meet the people in the crowd. When the King and Queen's train passed through the smallest stations, they stood on the rear platform to respond to the welcoming crowds, sufficiently demonstrating sincere royal courtesy. The King also ordered the installation of an electric bell. When the driver saw people along the way, he would press this bell. After hearing the bell, the King and Queen would go to the nearest window to wave to the people on the roadside. It is expected that the King and Queen will also receive a warm welcome from the American people when they arrive in the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters Cranbrook, 26th] The King and Queen arrived here at 10 pm (standard time). The welcoming crowd reached 200,000 people, including 2,000 Native Americans, who brought their wives and children to camp out and wait. The visit to Cranbrook is the final stop of their Majesties' tour of Canada. Tomorrow they will rest in Banff National Park.

<h3>Italian Ambassador to England Criticizes the French Press, Causing Comments from Various French Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 27th] The Italian Ambassador to England, Count Grandi, gave a speech severely criticizing the French press, which has caused comments from various newspapers in Paris. The speech was given at the Italian Embassy here on Thursday of this week due to the signing of a military alliance between Germany and Italy. The German ambassador was also present at the time. Italian newspapers have prominently published this exchange, but it has not been publicly released in London. One newspaper claimed that an ambassador should avoid publicly expressing political opinions in the capital of the host country, which is the duty of the ambassador. Ambassador Grandi has disregarded this traditional etiquette. Various newspapers believe that the Italian ambassador's actions were instructed by Mussolini.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong's Military and Police Expenditures Have Been Enormous Over the Past Year, the Hong Kong Government Announces Financial Revenue and Expenditure Statistics for the Year, the Surplus After Offsetting Revenue and Expenditure Breaks Previous Records</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government authorities announced yesterday in the Government Gazette the financial revenue and expenditure situation for the first quarter of 1939. According to the announcement, the total financial revenue for April was HK$14,649,618.51. This figure is an increase of HK$2,477,330 compared to the same period last year. As of the end of April, the total surplus in the Hong Kong treasury was HK$16,258,310.09. This figure has also created a new record in history, indicating that the financial revenue and expenditure situation of the Hong Kong government has gradually improved.</p>
<p>Good Financial Situation This Year</p>
<p>Taking the month of April alone, the total revenue for April was HK$3,500,650.51, and the total expenditure was only HK$2,626,021.29. Comparing the revenue and expenditure, the surplus for the month of April alone reached HK$904,629. Among the revenue items, the income from the sale of government land was the highest, totaling HK$1,200,787.73 from January to the end of April (HK$120,302.35 for the month of April alone). This figure exceeds the budget for this year by HK$457,872. The income from the sale of government land during the same period last year was only HK$151,913.93. The increase in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year is substantial. In terms of tobacco and alcohol tax, the total revenue for April this year was HK$592,104.43, while it was HK$772,839.31 in the same period last year. This year's license fee is slightly reduced. The total revenue for April this year was HK$1,615,734.13, an increase of HK$100,000 compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Reduced Revenue from Post Office and Railway</p>
<p>In addition, the Post Office and the Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau have seen a reduction in revenue due to the severe impact of the war in South China. The Post Office's revenue for April this year was HK$356,533.78, while the figure for the same period last year was HK$270,160.30. The Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau's revenue for April this year was only HK$69,135.56, while the figure for the same period last year was HK$175,257.50, a difference of more than HK$110,000. In addition, the total miscellaneous income totaled HK$354,540.79, an increase of approximately HK$300,000 compared to the same period last year. The reason is the large increase in the population of Hong Kong and the increase in various consumption activities.</p>
<p>Military Subsidy of HK$500,000</p>
<p>As for expenditure, the largest item among the various expenditures in April this year was the army subsidy. In recent years, the British military authorities have actively strengthened Hong Kong's military defense, so the Hong Kong government's responsibility for military expenses has also gradually increased. The total amount of army subsidy expenditure by the Hong Kong government in April this year reached HK$500,000. At the same time, the police expenses have also increased compared to normal times due to Hong Kong being in an extraordinary period. The total expenditure in April this year was HK$291,891.54. Other items include HK$253,723.21 for charity expenditures, HK$14,511.49 for education expenditures, HK$217,181.18 for medical bureau expenditures, and HK$139,843.69 for public works bureau expenditures. All of the above figures are an increase compared to the same period last year. Statistics show that from January to April, the total amount of various expenditures has accounted for 30% of the total expenditure budget for 1939.</p>

<h3>Unenthusiastic Registration of British Nationals, Closing Date Approaching, Number Still Far Away, Severe Penalties for Late Registration</h3>
<p>The registration of British nationals in Hong Kong has been in effect for nearly two months since the authorities announced its implementation. During this period, the British people's filling out the forms for registration has been extremely slow. In order to urge registration and expedite matters, the authorities have posted notices on public buses and government agencies, ordering British people to register as soon as possible to avoid penalties for late registration. However, after the implementation of this method, the registration is still not enthusiastic. According to official sources yesterday, the authorities have implemented various methods to urge British people to register, but the results obtained are still not good. The number of people who have registered as of now is far from the authorities' budget. There are only five days left until the final closing date (until the 31st of this month), and there will be no extension to implement penalties as a warning to those who are slow. The authorities hope that the registration can be completed within this period.</p>
<h3>HKU Vice-Chancellor Gives Speech in Chongqing, "Impressions of a Trip to Chongqing," Central Radio Station Broadcasts It, Europe, America and Hong Kong Can Listen</h3>
<p>HKU Vice-Chancellor Mr. Schloss gave a pre-recorded English speech entitled "Impressions of a Trip to Chongqing" at the invitation of the Central Broadcasting Station when he was in Chongqing. The station broadcast it to Europe, America and the Nanyang area on the 25th and 26th respectively. The translation is roughly as follows: I have had a very good impression of this trip to Chongqing. I will tell you about it in five points. (1) There is an optimistic atmosphere here. All residents are aware of the importance of their responsibilities, work hard, are serious, and have a spirit of responsibility for the long term. (2) Displaying the map of Chongqing after the bombing proves that the Japanese planes bombed without a target. The results of three bombings have been that civilians have been killed and injured. However, the city's rescue work is carried out very quickly, and the people are especially calm. (3) Various constructions are carried out quickly. There are dedicated and skilled workers. The establishment of a rural economy will surely deceive Chinese villages. (4) The construction of the Central University's campus in Chongqing was completed in just 32 days. The faculty and students are very happy and healthy. These are talents for various constructions in the new era. After this arduous training, the quality can be imagined. (5) The deepest impression is the image of the great leader President Chiang. His personality is unparalleled in the world. His extraordinary spirit of fighting to maintain national survival and world peace is unforgettable. Mrs. Chiang's efforts to assist in the war of resistance and national construction are also admired by the world.</p>
<p>Also, radio listeners in Hong Kong heard the Hong Kong broadcasting station rebroadcasting HKU Vice-Chancellor Mr. Schloss's speech from Chongqing XGOY Central Broadcasting Station at 10:00 PM the night before. The speech was given by Mr. Schloss in Chongqing recently. The original speech was recorded and was originally scheduled to be broadcast on the 25th of this month, but it was postponed until the night before because it happened to be a day when planes attacked Chongqing. Mr. Schloss recently went to Chongqing and met with our country's military and political leaders, and witnessed the construction and relief activities in the rear of our country, and paid tribute to the excellent spirit of our people in resisting the war of aggression. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, planes bombed Chongqing, and on the 24th, they bombed again. Mr. Schloss happened to be in Chongqing and witnessed all the tragic situations. Mr. Schloss was deeply impressed by the Chinese industrial cooperative movement, the perseverance of Chinese youth, and the Chinese women led by Mrs. Chiang in rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees. Mr. Schloss's impressions in Chongqing are detailed in his speech. Mr. Schloss returned to Hong Kong from Chongqing five days ago.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Student Union Plans to Participate in the League of Nations Student Congress, Meeting Scheduled for Early Next Month to Discuss, Soliciting Opinions from the Entire Hong Kong Student Community</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Student Congress, initiated and convened by the World Student Association, is scheduled to be held in Nice, France in mid-August this year. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association is currently planning to send representatives to participate. According to the person in charge of the association, the convening of the League of Nations Student Congress has great significance. All the current problems of all countries in the world will be raised for discussion at the congress. The convener of the congress, the World Student Association, sent representatives to our country last year to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the extreme situation of our country's war of resistance. The association expressed great sympathy for our war of resistance. After the representatives returned to Europe, they promoted our war of resistance along the way in various countries. It is believed that the League of Nations Student Congress will discuss our country's problems. The student community in our country should send representatives to participate in this congress to take this opportunity to announce to the world's students the various acts of aggression by aggressors in the Far East, and to arouse the sympathy of the world's students to jointly sanction aggression. According to what this association knows, the preparatory committee of the League of Nations Student Congress has now printed letters of convening the meeting and charters, and sent them to various countries around the world, inviting them to send representatives to participate. It is believed that they will be sent to Hong Kong soon. This association is currently considering the issue of selecting representatives to participate. This matter is the responsibility of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee has already scheduled a meeting in the first week of next month, at which time it will discuss and decide on issues such as "whether to send representatives to participate in the League of Nations Student Congress", "election of representatives", and "whether the Hong Kong Student Union should join as a member of the League of Nations Student Association". At the same time, the association will send letters to all overseas Chinese schools and youth organizations to solicit proposals for the congress, so as to integrate the opinions of the entire Hong Kong student community and draft proposals for Hong Kong student representatives as a basis for discussion.</p>

<h3>"China Salvation's" Most Refined Masterpiece: Impressions of "Fleeing to Hong Kong"</h3>
<p>Don't cry, bring out your strength - Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Because resistance against Japan is above all else, everything is subordinate to the resistance. Drama, therefore, becomes the most effective cultural tool for publicizing and educating the masses.</p>
<p>Look—the front lines, the rural areas, where are there no footprints of anti-Japanese drama troupes—look! The creation of anti-Japanese scripts is flourishing like bamboo shoots after a rain—in this process, I don't know how many soldiers have been inspired, how many compatriots have been moved—and which play is the most fluent, the most widespread, the most interesting, and the most effective? Needless to say, of course, "Put Down Your Whip" comes first. Because this is the most successful work of "expressing new content in old forms"; performing on the streets is especially suitable for the broad masses.</p>
<p>"China Salvation" marched north and south for twenty months, performing 741 times. "Put Down Your Whip" is the most frequently performed, technically the most refined, and most satisfying representative work. The day before yesterday evening, the troupe performed "Defending the Motherland" at the Lee Theatre as a charity performance, and "Fleeing to Hong Kong" was adapted from "Put Down Your Whip". Although the reporter was unable to see the first three acts due to scheduling conflicts, it was anticipated that when it came to the performance of "Fleeing to Hong Kong", it would be necessary to put aside other matters and rush to see it.</p>
<p>Tell the readers: After watching, the reporter was not only not disappointed, but also felt an unexpected gain.</p>
<p>The curtain opens with a street performance scene. Jinshan plays Zhang San, dressed in ragged clothes with all white hair, every word and action vividly resembling a pitiful old man. Wang Ying plays Xiang Jie, perfectly like a charming folk girl.</p>
<p>Fan Zheng also braided a red braid on his head and became a young helper.</p>
<p>With a clang of gongs and drums, a call and a response: with light and heavy, harmonious rhythm, the abilities of the three of them are truly great, we really feel like we are watching a street performance. Originally: Xiang Jie and her father, Old Man Zhang San, are northerners, and lived a comfortable life farming. Unexpectedly, the devil's hand stretched over, Xiang Jie's mother was killed—the family also went bankrupt. The father and daughter were left dependent on each other, wandering homeless. The few coins they carried with them were long gone. Without any relatives to turn to, they had to make a living by performing in the streets. Fortunately, Xiang Jie is naturally intelligent and talented in her skills, wandering everywhere, and is able to attract some viewers. Their daily income can barely maintain the lives of the father, daughter, and young helper. These days of wandering have recently brought them from the mainland to Hong Kong. The hardships of life have only made them feel haggard and weak.</p>
<p>This day, while performing in the streets, Xiang Jie, following the old man and the young helper, performed many skills. But, because she was too weak to support herself, she could not sing, and fell down several times. Zhang Laotou, for the sake of livelihood, began to whip Xiang Jie painfully. The audience, feeling sorry for such a delicate woman, were all indignant. They shouted, "Put down your whip!" Two straightforward young men, moved by chivalry, even stepped forward to intervene. Xiang Jie, seeing that her father had provoked public anger, explained the situation in detail to the audience. The young men, realizing the truth, regretted their rashness and comforted the father and daughter.——This is a summary of the plot development. The old man's teeth are missing, and the makeup is very realistic. The performance of spitting saliva at tense moments, as well as the "but then again" tone, is simply identical to a street performing old man. The young helper scolds Wang Jingwei in his dialogue and drum lyrics, ever-changing, full of fun. The audience shouted "Do it again!"—"Do it again!"—The atmosphere is extremely tense.</p>
<p>Xiang Jie sings moving tunes, accompanied by the old man playing the strings. Whether it is expression, voice, lyrics, stage steps, it can be said to be the pinnacle of perfection—the focus of the audience is concentrated, and the applause bursts forth like thunder. The atmosphere is both tense and enthusiastic. It is a rare entertainment event, and also a lecture to promote the resistance against Japan. "Don't cry, bring out your strength." Both solemn and humorous, both serious and lively. When the old man whips Xiang Jie again, it provokes public anger, fully expressing sympathy.</p>
<p>These three characters are versatile and are completely street performers. They are completely different from the Jinshan, Wang Ying, and Fan Zheng seen on ordinary days. The reporter shed tears of sympathy for their plight, really forgetting that they were acting. In fact, isn't this also our Chinese people's common experience? Without a high degree of passion and real-life experience, "China Salvation's" acting would certainly not have achieved this great success. Therefore, the reporter was reminded of their story of performing for the troops in Shangcheng: "The brothers were all sitting neatly on the ground, halfway through the play, the sky suddenly became阴雨. It rained harder and harder. At that time, we (China Salvation) and the officers of the division discussed that, in order to avoid the brothers getting rained on, we would be willing to walk thirty miles tomorrow to perform again in the barracks. The officer stood on the high ground and asked: "Comrades of the National Salvation Drama Troupe are afraid that we will get rained on and are willing to perform again in our barracks tomorrow. Now, go back or not?" "Don't go back!" This was the brothers' loud reply. "We will keep watching!" - Another loud shout."</p>
<p>Also, recently when they were performing for the troops in Shaoguan, they moved all the officers and soldiers. General Zhang Fakui personally ordered all the soldiers to salute all the members of the China Salvation troupe. ——It turns out that the drama that moved the soldiers and civilians is right before our eyes. Under deep emotion, in addition to expressing respect to the China Salvation friends, I must also give a faithful report to the readers! The fourth act of "Defending the Motherland" is "Fleeing to Hong Kong". Today, the performances at the Lee Theatre, both in the afternoon and evening, are to entertain students and citizens. Go see it, you will know that what the reporter can praise is only one in a hundred.</p>

<h3>Expanding National Salvation Propaganda: The National Salvation Drama Troupe Continues Performances - Special Discounted Ticket Prices for Hong Kong Residents - Seven Performances in Three Days Starting This Morning Still at the Lee Theatre</h3>
<p>The China National Salvation Drama Troupe's first overseas performance, which caused a sensation in Hong Kong, is finally fleetingly slipping away. The facts have given us a strong proof that the "China Salvation's" charity performance, everything from the plot, acting, scenery, lighting, costumes... all the conditions that constitute the art of drama, are great and unprecedented, making people praise and marvel. "Running through the north and south battlefields for twenty months, beloved by hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians, it is truly worthy of the name. The audience who has had the opportunity to personally witness the China Salvation's performance is greatly inspired and reminisces, those who have not seen it, inevitably feel a sense of loss and regret. "Recalling the memory, the audience hopes for "another performance" to feast their eyes; the audience who missed it also hopes for "another performance" to make up for the regret. Therefore, urging the "China Salvation" to "have another performance" has become the common request of the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese and drama enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Although the "China Salvation" drama troupe's performance has been sold out for three consecutive nights, the audience is mostly from the middle and upper classes, which is more focused on completing the task of raising funds to aid wounded soldiers and refugees. In order to promote to a wider range of students and the general public, and to achieve greater results, they responded to the request for "another performance" and, starting today, for three consecutive days, will have the 743rd large-scale performance to entertain Hong Kong students and the public. This is the news that the readers love to hear, right?</p>
<p>In the past, "China Salvation" had more than 700 performances in China, all of which were free public receptions. However, Hong Kong is not like the mainland after all. The countryside is a theater everywhere. Since it is performed in the theater, due to the theater rent, seats and other environmental conditions, it has to be slightly limited. Therefore, the ticket prices are set at three types: 40 cents, 20 cents, and 10 cents. However, such popular ticket prices are unprecedented in Hong Kong, right? The performance times and play names are: today (Sunday) 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM will be "Defending the Motherland"; tonight 8:00 PM "Spring in Taierzhuang"; tomorrow (29th) 3:00 PM and 8:00 PM "Long Live the Nation"; the day after tomorrow (30th) 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM "Spring in Taierzhuang". This can be regarded as an unprecedented and meaningful great achievement in the Hong Kong theater world.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate students from various schools to visit, "China Salvation" yesterday entertained the principals of various schools to discuss the matter. All schools or organizations that provide a letter of proof can reserve seats at the Lee Theatre one day in advance. When the reporter wrote this manuscript, I heard that most of the tickets for today have been sold. The previous three days of "China Salvation's" performances were originally record-breaking charity performances. This time, the expansion of publicity is even more meaningful. "China Salvation's" hard work and dedication are even more admirable. To receive the baptism of the War of Resistance, to appreciate the most advanced theatrical art, to visit the China Salvation performance at an unprecedentedly low price is really an unprecedented opportunity. I hope that the broad masses of overseas Chinese will not miss this opportunity. After "China Salvation" finishes performing, they will go abroad to take on a greater task. Everyone who has seen "China Salvation" performing is deeply moved by it. Go see "China Salvation's" play, it will definitely not disappoint you.</p>

<h3>Over a Thousand Japanese Troops Attacked Tanbu Yesterday, Suffering Heavy Blows From Our Forces - Over 200 Japanese Soldiers Killed, Extremely Large Haul of Military Supplies - Our Army Takes Advantage of Opportunity to Attack the Japanese Rear, Charging into Shizhang</h3>
<p>(West River Express News) For the past ten days, our army on the Northeast River front in Guangdong has repeatedly attacked the Japanese forces from Zengcheng, Conghua, and Hua County, achieving repeated victories. The Japanese have also continuously increased reinforcements, attempting to struggle. After the Japanese reinforcements were dispatched from various lines, they became restless again, attempting to advance on our positions. The Japanese forces around the areas of Chancheng, Tanbu, Yanguan Yao, Fengyong, and Jinshan Temple have been repeatedly ambushed by our forces in the past ten days. In recent days, seven or eight hundred infantry, cavalry, and artillery soldiers, as well as more than a dozen mountain cannons, have been transferred from the Foshan area to increase defenses. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese forces in Fengyong dispatched a mixed Japanese unit of over a thousand troops, with several cannons and five tanks, advancing along the Chancheng-Tanbu Road to attack Tanbu. They used artillery to fiercely bombard our positions, covering the infantry and cavalry surging forward. Our 12th Army Group's Zhao Division, stationed there, immediately deployed its forces to meet the enemy, fighting repeatedly and advancing repeatedly. By 3:00 PM, over 200 Japanese soldiers had been annihilated. The remaining Japanese forces, unable to withstand the attacks, fled south in disarray. Our army relentlessly pursued them, the Japanese leaving behind many corpses and weapons, retreating back to Fengyong. In this battle, our army suffered only a few dozen casualties, while the Japanese had already been routed. Our forces are currently pursuing the victory. In addition, when the Japanese forces attacked Tanbu, our Yu Brigade's assault team took advantage of the emptiness of the Japanese rear, launching a surprise attack, with a certain battalion dividing into three routes to encircle Shizhang Township, west of Fengyong. The Japanese forces there were mostly newly recruited soldiers from Taiwan and Korea, with weak combat power. They were defeated with one blow. Our heroic army charged into the Japanese positions, searching for as long as two hours, killing several dozen Japanese soldiers before safely withdrawing. Currently, the Japanese troops in the nearby villages of Wengang, Mingtang, and Ningbian near Fengyong are all afraid of being pursued by our army, increasing the number of sentries day and night, their defenses being heavily guarded.</p>
<h3>Our Army Vigorously Implements a Scorched Earth Policy - No Stockpiling of Materials Within 100 Kilometers of the Front Lines - Each County in Qingyuan, Hua, and Conghua Mobilizes the Masses to Form Assault Teams</h3>
<p>[North River Express] There are still minor skirmishes along the North Guangdong front lines. In order to prepare for a large-scale offensive, military authorities are actively implementing various adjustments and deployments to strengthen their strength. The latest situation regarding the North River is as follows:</p>
<p>Stockpiling of Grain and Materials Prohibited on the Front Lines</p>
<p>The Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Fourth War Zone, following the instructions of Bai Chongxi, Chief of the Southwest Headquarters, vigorously implemented a scorched earth policy in order to blockade Japanese-occupied areas. It specially ordered the commanders of the front-line defense forces, guerrilla commanders, and county governments to destroy and relocate as much material as possible that could be used by the Japanese forces in advance, so as to prevent it from falling into Japanese hands when the Japanese army invades. Unless absolutely necessary, no stockpiling of food, resources, or wealth is allowed within 100 kilometers of the front lines. Qingyuan, Hua, Conghua, and Fogang counties in the North River area have been designated as scorched earth zones. In addition to the destruction of all transportation lines and blockhouses in each village, all rice, miscellaneous grains, fuel, copper, iron, livestock, and various equipment and materials must be continuously transported away from the front lines, to the extent that it can supply the needs of the people on the front lines. Each county has received orders and is implementing them one after another.</p>
<p>Mobilizing the Masses to Form Assault Teams</p>
<p>In order to launch a broad guerrilla war and mobilize the people of each county to participate in killing the Japanese, the North River military authorities specially ordered Ouyang Lei, the county magistrate of Qingyuan County, Cui Guangxiu, the county magistrate of Hua County, Li Linggen, the county magistrate of Conghua County, and Wu Guanhong, the commander of the Second Guerrilla Column, and the commanders of each defense force, to organize assault teams in each village, to use the local armed forces to attack the Japanese and assist in the counter-offensive. It has been found that each village in Qingyuan and Conghua has been organized and established under the supervision of the commander. They are currently active on the front lines and in the rear of the Japanese army. In addition to the regular army guerrilla units, assault teams have sprung up and expanded their activities, constantly attacking the Japanese in recent days, reaping significant battle results.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Surprise Attack on Zengcheng from Mount Luofu Achieves Victory - Blocking the Japanese Army's Supply Line is Showing Great Effect</h3>
<p>(East River Express) In the East River counter-offensive, our army is steadily advancing according to plan, and is now paying attention to blockading the Japanese army's transportation lines and cutting off its supplies. Therefore, small skirmishes are constantly occurring on the front lines. The military situation in recent days is as follows:</p>
<p>Surprise Attack on Zengcheng</p>
<p>Chen Shuying Regiment's Chen Wukui Unit of a certain army stationed around Mount Luofu, along with Bu Zhiyang Unit of the Third Detachment of the Third Zone Column's guerrillas, crossed the Zeng River on the 21st and launched a fierce surprise attack on the Japanese army in Zengcheng. A fierce battle took place on the Bo Zeng Road on the eastern outskirts of Zengcheng. The Japanese army tried to prevent us from entering the city, destroying the wooden bridge at the East Gate. However, our regiment showed extraordinary bravery, swimming across the river and leaping forward. The Japanese army relied on machine-gun positions built along the riverbanks, firing fiercely to stop our advance. However, Chen's unit eventually used clever methods to reach the other side, engaging in close combat with the Japanese army and completing their mission, before automatically withdrawing. As a result of the surprise attack, dozens of Japanese soldiers were annihilated and many Japanese military supplies were seized. When our regiment made contact with the Japanese army, cannon fire was also heard in Boluo.</p>
<p>Blockading Japanese Areas</p>
<p>In order to blockade the Japanese forces in Zengcheng and Shilong and cut off their supplies, our army on the East Road has now completely blockaded the water and land transportation lines in the lower reaches of the East River. All grains and daily necessities, industrial raw materials, are prohibited from entering the Japanese areas. Considerable results have now been achieved. It has been found that the Japanese army, due to the cut-off of supplies, is in a state of panic. In recent days, they have instigated traitors to sneak into the interior to buy grain, rice, oil, salt, firewood, and other goods and transport them for their use. Yesterday, several civilian boats loaded with the above-mentioned items were attempting to smuggle them through Boluo, but were discovered by the local defense forces. The boats were immediately detained for investigation, as they were deemed to be providing supplies to the Japanese. In addition, the Third Zone Guerrilla Column Headquarters issued a proclamation yesterday, explaining the meaning of the blockade to the people and earnestly advising them not to smuggle goods to supply the Japanese in the future, otherwise they would be convicted of undermining the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attacked Dajin Island the Day Before Yesterday - Two Bombs Dropped, Two Casualties</h3>
<p>(Taishan Express) In recent days, Japanese planes have often passed through the Taishan area, raiding various parts of the Siyi region. At around 8:00 AM on the 25th, two Japanese planes flew to the skies above Chixi, circled, and then passed over Dajin Island, dropping two bombs. One hit the leprosarium pier on the island, destroying the pier. The other fell next to the Macau Xinfat Ferry near the pier, damaging part of the ferry's stern with shrapnel, resulting in one passenger dead and one wounded. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes fled towards Xinhui.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Calamity in Lielou - All Japanese Forces Have Withdrawn to Jiujiang</h3>
<p>(Nanhai Express) Since falling into Japanese hands, Lielou in Shunde County has been subjected to thorough searches by the Japanese, with all merchants' and civilians' assets being looted. Local residents, unable to endure the Japanese army's brutal trampling, have mostly fled, particularly those with wealth. Consequently, the Japanese army has withdrawn entirely to Jiujiang to reinforce defenses, as there is nothing left to plunder. It has been found that commercial business in Lielou city has come to a halt for the most part, and the area is desolate. Looking back at the prosperity of the past, one cannot help but feel moved.</p>
<h3>The Fourth War Zone Water and Land Transportation Management Office - Established in Early June -</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express] The provincial government's preparatory organization for the Water and Land Transportation Office was previously suspended. It was then transferred to the Fourth War Zone for handling. Commander Zhang now believes that wartime transportation requires unified control and management, and assigned the responsible organization to the Military Affairs Section of the headquarters for preparation, with a deadline of early June for its establishment. It is said that the scope of the joint order is as follows: the rectification of trunk highways and waterways within Guangdong Province, the use of vehicles and ships during wartime, and the method of requisitioning will all be handled by the office as the environment requires. The principle is to coordinate with the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Advances and Retreats on the Jiangmen-Xinhui Front Lines - We Capture Xiangshan, Japanese Advance to Muling and Lucun - A Japanese Plane Harassing Liantang Shot Down by Our Forces</h3>
<p>(Zhongshan Express) Our forces attacking Jiangmen-Xinhui have advanced into Baishi and Dahui, and the road connecting Jiangmen and Xinhui may be cut off. To contain our forces, the Japanese launched a full-scale offensive on Xinhui Road on the 26th, but our strength is strong, and the Japanese army's conspiracy failed again. The battle situation is as follows: (1) Jiangmen area: Our forces advanced into Baishi, Dahui, and Qibang on the night of the 24th, and the Japanese forces in Jiangmen are already in critical condition. On the 25th, they used all their strength to break out from the Xinhui Station and launch a counter-offensive on Muling and Duran. Another unit attacked Tangxia from Zhutou Mountain, with approximately three thousand soldiers. Our forces immediately blocked and attacked at Beiwulai Village and Shizitan in Muling, with fierce battles. The Japanese forces on Zhutou Mountain took advantage of the cover of shallow-water warships, landed near Zhoujun, and used tanks to charge at our positions. In order to avoid overextending, our troops approaching Jiangmen withdrew to Mulang and blocked the attacking Japanese forces. Therefore, the Japanese army was able to drive straight along the Xinhui Station Road, breaking through the Mulang defense line. However, the Duran position is still in our hands, and rear troops are rushing to the front lines for reinforcements. (2) Xinkai Road area: Our forces have continued to attack the remaining Japanese troops in Xinhui. On the 25th, the Japanese army withdrew a unit to rescue Jiangmen. On the 26th, our forces took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on the Xiangshan blockhouse behind the Xiping People's Hospital in Xinhui, encircling the two hundred or so Japanese troops stationed there. The Japanese stubbornly resisted with dense steel cannons, but our morale was high. We rushed to the top of the mountain in one go, annihilating more than half of the Japanese troops and eventually defeating them, capturing four small steel cannons and a large amount of ammunition. The remaining Japanese troops trapped in Xinhui have lost their western defenses and feel extremely threatened. Our attacking troops, with the cover of Xiangshan, are continuing to encircle Xinhui. (3) On the morning of the 25th, a Japanese plane flew to Liantang Station to drop bombs, and continued to fly to Pingdiling to spy, but was hit in the tail by our artillery with anti-aircraft machine guns, caught fire, and crashed near Baisha. The fuselage was completely destroyed and two pilots were burned to death. (4) On the morning of the 26th, more than a thousand Japanese troops boarded shallow-water warships and transport ships to Bei Street, reinforcing Jiangmen. After the Japanese forces that had infiltrated the Xinhui Road re-occupied Muling, Lucun, and Old Village, they advanced to Fozi at noon on the 26th. Our forces bravely rose up to meet them, and fierce battles broke out with the Japanese. The situation is still deadlocked.</p>
<p>(West River Express) It seems that the Japanese army still wants to defend Jiangmen and Xinhui, and is building cannon fortresses in Qibang Township near Jiangmen, and has also built fortresses and machine-gun nests along the two strongholds of Luoshan and Zhuzi Ridge between Jiangmen and Xinhui. Two fortresses have been built on Guifeng Mountain near Gangzhou Road in Xinhui City, in order to ensure that the liaison line between the two places is not cut off by our forces. Iron cables and sandbag fortifications have been set up at Zhizheng Bridge (in front of the county government), and the Yiji Bridge and Hanlu Bridge on the west gate in Xinhui City to prevent our forces from breaking in during the siege.</p>
<h3>All Public Servants in the Province Donate One Day's Salary - To Be Used to Comfort the Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express) The Guangdong Province Recruitment and慰劳 Association has launched a campaign to collect goods and funds to慰劳 soldiers on the front lines and wounded soldiers in the rear. People from all walks of life in the province have responded enthusiastically and generously donated. It has been found that the association yesterday also decided that all public servants in the province will donate one day's salary for the慰劳 of soldiers fighting against Japan. In addition, the慰劳 delegations organized by the association have been prepared and are scheduled to depart on June 1, first going to Conghua, Qingyuan, Hua County, and then to the East and West Rivers.</p>
<h3>Discovery of × Submarine in the Beihai Area, No Unusual Movement of More Than Ten × Warships</h3>
<p>(Beihai Express) Warships along the southern coastal route, suddenly erratic, their purpose unclear, seem to be trying to contain our forces. Coastal surveillance posts reported on the 23rd that between Yangji and Fangcheng, seventeen or eighteen enemy warships were spotted, and × warships frequently traveled to and from the waters off Xuwen, but there was no unusual movement. Near Zhou Island, there was a × giant cruiser, with three attached aircraft. At approximately 8:00 AM on the 22nd, a × submarine was discovered in the Beihai area, but it quickly escaped without a trace. It has been found that the × army is currently planning to build a submarine base in Yulin Port, Qiongya, and is actively proceeding with it.</p>
<h3>Guangdong New Games Planned, Savings Deposits for Civil Servants to Be Implemented Starting in June</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express) The Guangdong New Life Movement Promotion Association believes that as we are in the second phase of the war of resistance, all Chinese people should strictly practice thrift and savings, saving material and financial resources on the one hand, and increasing national resources on the other, to strive for final victory. Therefore, in addition to formulating measures to promote savings among ordinary people, it is also planning to organize savings for national salvation among civil servants. According to its content, the association plans to invite various government agencies and the Guangdong Provincial Bank to jointly draft detailed regulations, with the provincial bank responsible for collecting savings monthly. Letters have already been sent to various agencies to solicit opinions, and a meeting is planned again in the coming days to decide on detailed measures, which will be implemented starting in June.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Brave Killing of × by Qingyuan Civilians</h3>
<p>— Ye Naibing</p>
<p>At 3:00 AM on the 20th, more than 600 × troops truly arrived at Baitu via Maizhu from Conghua (about fifteen li northwest of Maigan). The Self-Defense Corps had been on alert there and immediately rose up to meet them. The × troops, encountering interception, were unable to advance, retreated slightly, and divided their forces to circle around our Self-Defense Corps. At that time, all our villages sounded [missing character] to summon the members to mobilize. In a short time, more than two thousand members came out and encircled the × troops in two groups, one in Zhuer and the other on Dwarf Ridge. The × troops used houses as cover and resisted stubbornly. However, because our Self-Defense Corps did not have artillery, they could not break through the houses, so there was no way to eliminate the × troops. After a night of fierce fighting, on the 21st, our regular troops rushed to help, and another unit was dispatched, led by Major Ma, to raid the left flank. As a result, the morale of the people was even more invigorated, and they rushed forward to eliminate the × troops in Zhuer. At that time, sixty or seventy × troops were killed, and of course, more were wounded. At the same time, several × machine guns, dozens of rifles, and countless bullets were seized. On the same day, another unit of our army, diagonally out of Taipingchang, attacked the flank to cut off the × troops' retreat. On the 22nd, three × aircraft came to help, bombing our positions, strafing with machine guns, and dropping bullets and dry rations to supply the trapped × troops, and reinforced with a thousand infantrymen. This was the first time that our Self-Defense Corps had fought against external forces. Because they lacked experience, they were afraid of the × aircraft, and at the same time, the × reinforcements launched a fierce [missing character] against our outer lines, so the encirclement line wavered, and the × troops were able to break through. We retreated and defended the highlands around Louling, more than thirty li southeast of Guanzhuang Pajiankou, but we continued to launch fierce attacks against the × troops. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, on the morning of the 23rd, the × troops suddenly fired wildly at us [missing characters]. Most of the strong artillery fire missed, and we ignored it. The × troops then retreated automatically.</p>
<p>It is very clear that this time the × troops invaded Qingyuan, but they were ultimately defeated by our people's anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps. This is only the first time.</p>
<p>As a result of this battle, more than 400 × soldiers and officers were killed or wounded. We captured more than 20 rifles, 5 machine guns, 2 artillery pieces, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Our civilians suffered more than 30 casualties, and more than 300 civilian houses in the Aotou Furnace area were burned by the × troops [missing character].</p>
<p>After this, the × troops hated the Self-Defense Corps in the Pajian area of Qingyuan even more. Out of anger, they even used × aircraft to distribute leaflets in the Conghua Huaxian area, publicly offering a reward of fifty yuan for the capture of a member of the Self-Defense Corps.</p>
<p>As a result, the people of the Pajian area actively purchased guns and strengthened their self-defense forces, newly purchasing more than 50 [missing character] machine guns and more than 1,000 rifles. In view of the failure of this war of resistance, the lack of bullets, lack of medicine, etc.; and at the same time requested the government to replenish bullets, issue wartime military rations and medicines, and provide pensions to the families of the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>After the defeat, the × troops were even more unwilling to accept it. On the morning of April 6, one division of × troops, [missing character] and other cavalry, totaling more than 10,000, crossed the river from Taipingchang Shen [missing character] and invaded north in three routes via Mumen. Another route came from Huaxian to contain our right flank. The × troops from Taipingchang were intercepted when they reached Qilong Mountain and could not advance, so they detoured to invade Yuncao. Another unit went straight to Aotou, and another unit diagonally out of the Qing Cong Highway, joining forces with Maigan Renhe. On the Aotou Huaxian side, one branch also invaded Baishi [missing character] attack [missing character] Dun, attempting to join forces at Miaodun. Unexpectedly, the × troops were blocked by our army at all the points they passed, and after a disastrous defeat, they were trying to detour to our rear via small roads, but everywhere there were self-defense groups, densely distributed and waiting in formation. The × troops were fiercely attacked by our people in Keng, Lianhu, Huangluo, Aotou, Shuixi, Xihuli, Yangmacun, Baitu, Renhexu, Miaodun, etc., making it impossible for the × troops to escape and collapsing into disarray, and hurriedly fleeing back to the original place (Taipingchang).</p>
<p>About 700 members participated in this battle. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the corpses of the × troops were immediately rushed away. Although it is impossible to accurately estimate, the casualties of the × troops were over 1,000. Two of our members were wounded and one died, and many spoils of war were captured.</p>
<p>Currently, there are more than 4,000 members of the Self-Defense Corps in the Pajian area, fully equipped with new rifles and bullets, and more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, all under the command of the Pajian Office of the People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps.</p>
<p>Their steps are unified, their spirit is brave; everyone is facing the great era, and they have become an anti-Japanese vanguard that cannot be taken lightly!</p>

<p>Movies and Theater</p>
<h3>Lin Huain's Virtuoso Jascha Heifetz Appears on the Screen, Completing a Musical Masterpiece</h3>
<p>A year ago, production giant Sam Goldwyn announced that he had signed a contract with world-renowned Lin Huain virtuoso Jascha Heifetz and would begin filming "Angels Making Musfc," a film about a Jewish musician being expelled from Nazi Germany. Unfortunately, less than a week later, the situation in Europe suddenly changed, and the project had to be stopped.</p>
<p>However, Heifetz's contract was not cancelled. Goldwyn invited a group of famous orchestras to accompany his Lin Huain, all of which were filmed and stored in Goldwyn's box for nearly a year because of a lack of a suitable storyline.</p>
<p>Recently, Miss Cuba Irmgarde Von Cube's screenplay depicting the situation of a music school was very much to Goldwyn's liking, and he decided to [missing character] produce it. At the same time, he found the film he had made last year from the box as a performance scene, so Xia Haifaiz had the opportunity to meet us on the screen.</p>
<p>It is said that the film has now started shooting, starring Margaret Stephenson, Zomike Livarde Blena. As for the title of the film, it was first called "The Exiles" and later changed to "The Restless Age."</p>
<h3>The King and Queen of Song</h3>
<p>Under the silver screen, the fans will not forget that pair of emperors and queens in the land of song, Jenny McDonald and Neil Eddie. The great musicals over the years have made everyone intoxicated, and the gates of the theaters are crowded. This grand occasion shows the appeal of those two great figures. In fact, their works are becoming more and more superior, and both the plot, scenery, singing, and expression are worthy of the word beautiful.</p>
<p>In the past, their works were all period costumes, and the colors used were simple black and white (except for the pink scene in "Peach Blossom Hate"), but in this "King and Queen of Song," there was a [missing character] human reform. They wear the most beautiful fashions, especially Jenny MacDonald's several fashion exhibitions, with novel styles and harmonious colors. None of the coats are original, and both Chinese and Western clothes are very suitable. The color of this film is rare; the bright natural color films are all outdoors, with beautiful landscapes and bright flowers and plants, which instinctively show beautiful colors. However, the scenes in "Winged Wings" are all indoors. Under this special situation, the bright colors depend on the beautiful costumes and pleasing scenery. Whether it is a table or a few, there are wonderful places that make people feel pleasing to the eye. Coupled with the great stage scenes, beautiful dances, and colorful backgrounds, even if this is a film without a plot, the color is enough to make people feel excited, let alone there is a very emotional story. You can think of it as satire, you can think of it as advising the world. In short, "Winged Wings" is a giant film produced under the equal development of plot, color, song, dance, and scenery. There are also many jokes there. If you feel that this spring is too annoying, I advise you to hurry up and go there to relieve your boredom.</p>
<h3>Trivia about the King and Queen of Song</h3>
<p>The opening day of the filming of "Winged Wings," June 18, 1938, was Jenny's birthday and the anniversary of her wedding week.</p>
<p>In "Winged Wings," the person who taught MacDonald to sing was Al Baitiana, Lai Qu, who was MacDonald's dance teacher when she first appeared on stage in New York at the age of ten.</p>
<p>MacDonald has red hair, green eyes, is five feet five inches tall, and weighs one hundred and eighteen pounds.</p>
<p>In the production of "Winged Wings," a total of 15,000 yards of fabric and 50,000 feet of silk were used.</p>
<p>The greatest scene is the scene of singing the theme song of "Winged Wings." Neil Siam Eddie and MacDonald stand at a height of eighty feet, surrounded by clouds and stars.</p>
<p>There are forty motors used to open the stage curtain, which shows the vastness of the project.</p>
<p>The most expensive and hard-to-see thing in the whole film is the Warren-style rubber heels on the shoes worn by the eighty-six Dutch women.</p>

Mandu, Mimi, and Claire are good friends. Nana has leather clothes, beads, and an arrogant face. They also have a common ambition, hoping to become famous artists in the future. This drama school is affiliated with the French National Theater and is a stepping stone to success.</p>
<p>Isma Peng also has ambitions, and many. If she is not beautiful, then passers-by have not noticed it, because quiet demeanor and shabby clothes cannot show beauty. If she has talent, the guidance of Pascal's brother, the school, has a bit of this feeling. He is too eager to believe that he wants to stand out in a class.</p>
<p>The rest of the people are happy, dissolute, and ambitious children, all young speculators, hoping to gain fame, fortune, and pleasure from this. But Iseros's hope is different, she wants to dedicate herself to art, until she is no longer Louise Mabon, and is the soul of thousands of celebrities - Camille, Juliet, Joan of Arc, Marie Antoinette, Electra, Egren - reappearance.</p>
<p>"I will play all these roles one day," she often said emotionally to her straightforward roommate Annie. "Wait and see. I want to make the people of the whole world worship me. I want them to shed tears, laugh - their lives are moved by emotion and beauty."</p>
<p>The realistic and persevering Annie did not always think so. "I hope you can get money from this at the same time"!</p>
<p>Louise would reply carelessly: "Of course. A lot of money, but it's not important."</p>
<p>They are always in debt for rent; they only eat some hard bread and sausage. "House, not bad!" Annie mocked, "It's not important at all! Every rich man will say that to people." In the dark, she felt that her friend was a little crazy [missing character]. But she loved her anyway - respected her tenderness, her innocence, and her perseverance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On the Depreciation of the Japanese Yen in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, the value of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market has been [missing character] depreciating. Ten days ago, the prices of Chinese legal tender and Japanese currency were slightly different and almost the same. However, for three days, the lowest time for 100 Japanese yen could only be exchanged for 89 legal tender. Moreover, according to the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, this situation is not very different, and it is feared that there may be continued development in the future. The Japanese yen circulating in the occupied areas of China is part of the banknotes issued by Japan. The rapid decline in the price of this part of the Japanese yen has revealed the extent to which Japan's currency inflation has reached.</p>
<p>China and Japan are at war, and the currency values of the two countries are barometers of the economic situation of the two countries. The two countries have adopted foreign exchange control policies and have their own statutory foreign exchange prices, and the prices are the same, that is, each Japanese yen is equivalent to one shilling and two pence in British gold, and each yuan of legal tender is also equivalent to one shilling and two pence in British gold. However, the foreign exchange prices of the Japanese yen flowing into the occupied areas of China in markets such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hong Kong are far from the statutory standards of the government, just like the legal tender. In June last year, 100 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for slightly less than 95 Japanese yen. In December, it could be exchanged for 92 Japanese yen. At that time, the outer price of legal tender in the black market was 8 pence per yuan of British gold. Therefore, the foreign exchange price of the Japanese [missing character] in the black market was indeed only between 8 and 9 pence per yuan. The statutory exchange rate of legal tender is one shilling and two pence, and the black market price is 8 pence. The Japanese side has tried to take this as an excellent material for publicity to prove the weakness of the Chinese legal tender base. In fact, the real price of the Japanese yen is just as bad as the legal tender. Now, the price of Shanghai legal tender in the black market still maintains the price of 8 pence, and the exchange rate of the Japanese yen to the legal tender is only 89 yuan of legal tender for every 100 Japanese yen. This means that the foreign exchange price of the Japanese yen is only 7 pence or more. The occupied areas of China are under the control of Japan. Japan can manipulate the Japanese yen and legal tender at will, but why can't Japan maintain its statutory standards for the Japanese yen in the occupied areas, and let its price be reduced below the Chinese legal tender? What does this barometer explain?</p>
<p>The sharp drop in the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai this time is by no means an accidental phenomenon, but the result of Japan's implementation of wartime economic policies. Since Japan's war against China, the source of military expenditure has been almost entirely derived from the issuance of public bonds and banknotes. Among them, the issuance of banknotes has increased by more than 1 billion yen by the end of last year. The scope of circulation of this huge amount of banknotes is not only in Japan, but also throughout its colonies. Recently, Japan's war against China has gradually expanded, and the war expenses required have also gradually increased. The increase in the issuance of banknotes has become an unavoidable fact. In March of this year, the Japanese government was submitting a bill in the National Assembly, advocating to increase the issuance amount of the three major banks in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea by 40% to 60%. In the past, the currency increase in Japan has caused the general public to feel extreme pain. Now, in order to maintain the social tranquility in Japan, it is necessary to exhaust the increased banknotes, that is, the phenomenon of currency increase, with the occupied areas of China as the tail. Therefore, they are flooded and depreciated.</p>
<p>In order to increase military expenditure, obtain various resources in the occupied areas of China, and establish the so-called "yen group" that is convenient for trade with Japan, and at the same time, to avoid the irreparable adverse effects of the yen increase on the domestic market, Japan has adopted a disguised indirect method.</p>

<h3>Football Charity Match - Rain or Shine, Held Today at Kai Shan - South China to Play with Original Lineup - League Team May Adjust Dickson to Center Back, Strengthening Offense and Defense</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Rainwater can irrigate the growth of all flora and fauna, and can also hinder general outdoor activities. It seems that every weekend lately, there has been incessant rain, causing all ball games to be stopped. Ballplayers sigh with disappointment, all wanting to ask the heavens why they are playing tricks.</p>
<p>The football charity match originally scheduled for last Saturday was postponed due to rain. South China's tour to Southeast Asia was also delayed due to this matter. Therefore, the charity match was re-scheduled to begin yesterday. Unexpectedly, the weather was uncooperative, with continuous rain, spoiling the good thing for the field again. The general public was also very disappointed.</p>
<p>To complete this charitable act, the South China authorities decided to change the match to today at 5:30 PM, still at Kai Shan. Even if it rains again at that time, it will not be postponed, because the team is scheduled to depart for Southeast Asia on the [unclear] day of this month. Due to the limited schedule, it is difficult to delay. If it cannot be performed today, it will have to wait until the cool autumn season to have a chance.</p>
<p>The lineup arranged by South China is not entirely of those going on the Southeast Asia tour, because one or two of them may not be able to go together. However, as of today, the list of those going to Southeast Asia has not been completely decided. It is unknown what the reason is. Some say that the person in charge is being cautious, but I say, "The more you hit, the longer the night becomes."</p>
<p>On the league team's side, the navy is the main force. It so happens that the "Eagle Ship" returned to Hong Kong from Singapore yesterday. Perhaps there will be minor changes to the lineup today. If they can improve the inside line and strengthen the defense, then there will definitely be a satisfactory performance. Good things are ahead, but heaven is in charge.</p>
<p>It is said that Dickson will be transferred to center back. This fellow is extraordinary. He is good at attacking, and his defense is good enough. However, the inside midfielders are still not suitable, and there will be many loopholes. Even if Dickson often retreats to help defend, it may not help. However, if Dickson plays, South China should not use the usual method of breaking through the center, but should focus on attacking from the left and right flanks to be more effective. The lineups of the two armies are as follows (Field Grand Duke):</p>
<p>South China Club</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Hou Rongsheng</p>

<h3>If It Clears Up Today, There Will Be Two Baseball Games - South China vs. Mindanao Makeup Game Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Yesterday's baseball league, originally a match between the South China Club and the Yubei team, was blocked by rain, so this good show could not be performed.

<h3>Unreasonable</h3>
<p>— Hua Fu</p>
<p>Although humans are the "spiritual beings of all things," surpassing all things in every aspect, it is regrettable that they have not completely detached themselves from the realm of "things." They still retain some "thing" nature and are unreasonable.</p>
<p>It is perhaps understandable that unreasonableness comes from illiterate people, commoners, or barbarians because these people are often regarded as "things" and deprived of the elegant title of "spiritual." However, unfortunately, unreasonableness can also come from scholars, high-ranking officials, or those who claim to be civilized. Moreover, the degree of unreasonableness in the latter sometimes seems more severe than in the former.</p>
<p>In the past, those who plotted to seize land, rape women, and monopolize lawsuits, implementing the principle of "what's yours is mine, and what's mine cannot be touched," were they not all scholars? "Magistrates" could "set fires," while "common people" could not "light lamps." "A lord can command his subject to die, and he must die; a father can command his son to perish, and he must perish." "There are no wrong parents under heaven." Following this line of reasoning, a person could be sentenced to slow slicing death, and the one being executed still had to kneel three times and kowtow nine times to "thank the emperor" for the sentence. ... Examples like these are either forcibly twisting "reason" or violating the laws of nature and "reason." Compared to robbing on the road and demanding "road toll," what is better about having a teahouse "adjudicate" before engaging in a full-scale armed fight?</p>
<p>Now, things are even worse, perhaps indeed an increase in degree. Let's not talk about anything else; just look at the countries that claim to be the most civilized. Their unreasonableness has simply created a new record, not only unprecedented but also unsurpassable, leaving future generations unable to catch up. They readily seek to destroy other countries, seize their lands, trample on innocent people, and plunder their movable property, disregarding treaties and agreements. They are unwilling to engage in "reasonable" consultation, negotiation, or discussion, and even if one appeals, pleads, or begs them, they pay no "attention" and act according to their own will. What is particularly hateful is that they still constantly claim that this is for peace, for the stability of a certain region, and for the happiness of the world. Their viciousness, cruelty, and brutality have truly reached the point where "reasoning is impossible," and it truly reflects the saying that the "plum tree" is planted in front of their door. Therefore, of all that is "reasonable" in the world, only this one family—one of the Trinity—exists, without division.</p>
<p>Some "gentlemen," who consider themselves kind and benevolent, believe that there is only one "right reason" in the world, but thousands of "wrong reasons." They choose to walk where there are more wrong reasons, and they have their own reasons. If the "right reason" were opened up and more were added, they would not exclusively walk the "wrong reason." Unexpectedly, this only makes things worse. It's like a tiger originally not knowing the taste of humans, but a "benevolent person" seeing it hungry sprinkles some blood for it to eat. Once it tastes it, it simply wants to eat people. It's also like Mr. Dongguo, who saved the wolf but it then wanted to eat him.</p>
<p>I believe that people who are unreasonable certainly have something wrong with their brains. Otherwise, why would they disregard human feelings and the laws of nature? The way to deal with them, besides offering appropriate persuasion like treating patients with medicine and injections, is to give them a sharp rebuke to make them suddenly realize. Otherwise, one can only lock them up and let them live or die on their own. Because reasoning is ineffective against the "unruly," one can only resort to this measure when dealing with the truly "unruly." Unreasonableness means having no sense of right and wrong: "Without a sense of right and wrong, one is not human." When dealing with "non-humans," one can only do this.</p>
<p>"When a person is about to die, their words are kind." Kind may be interpreted as "reasonable." The treacherous hero Cao Cao, who did so many unreasonable things throughout his life, had a will to "distribute incense and sell shoes" when he was about to die, which was "kind," which was reasonable. I think that those who are generally unreasonable now will probably only realize it when they are about to die!</p>
<p>Then, today's "gentlemen" or "benevolent people," if they truly want to see the Buddha to the Western Paradise and do things thoroughly, should find ways to prompt these unreasonable people to reach the stage of "their words are kind" as soon as possible! Saint Dan</p>
<h3>General Lu - Battlefield Memoirs</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>After the old man went to Ruichang military headquarters, Jian Yin was about to leave for Xianning in a few days because his holiday was over, and I, after going from Liu'an to Hankou, also had to return to the Dabie Mountains to continue the work I should be doing. At this time, the war on the periphery of Wuhan had entered a critical stage. However, because I had an appointment with General Lu Han, I had to postpone it slightly to see the demeanor of that Yunnanese general. Moreover, he had made special achievements in the Battle of Taierzhuang, and in order to collect some valuable historical materials, I also felt it necessary to meet him. Therefore, although I was packed and ready to go, I did not immediately say goodbye to Wuhan. At the same time, the defense zone he was currently in charge of was precisely at the end of the Yuehan Railway in Hunan Province. If the three towns were swallowed up, then his responsibility in the western Hubei region would be great. Therefore, my return to the Dabie Mountains was extended by two weeks.</p>
<p>I remember it was a day of heavy air raids. Several more deep pits were added to the Hanyang airfield. Fortunately, it was just the soil that suffered, flying up for no reason. They were always desperately fighting with the soil for what they "collected" as taxes. It really felt like a waste. Therefore, friends who returned from the battlefield all expressed indifference to the bombings. After the air raid alarm was lifted, the telephone rang: "General Lu is waiting for you at Dingyu Lane in Hunan Street. Please come immediately. He will be crossing the river this afternoon." It was the voice of Director Peng of the Political Training Department, with a heavy Yunnan accent.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Dingyu Lane, the first thing that appeared before me was several young women from the Yunnan Women's Battlefield Work Team. They had broken through from Xuzhou and walked a long distance of seven hundred miles. They did not seem tired at all, and they were as spirited as the Anhui University Women's Battlefield Work Team I had seen in Huayang. "Santa Claus is here. He must have brought some gifts!" The girls were really good at joking. I had only visited them once, but they were already very familiar with me. But what gifts did I have? I had none. All I had was a respectful greeting.</p>
<p>I met General Lu. His attitude was so "gentle and refined" that one would suspect he was a scholar, no, a university professor? His conversation was so orderly that he resembled a "skillful orator" diplomat. The conversation lasted for two hours before it stopped. The topic was, of course, the past Battle of Taierzhuang. Finally, he said: "When we return in triumph in the future, let's meet at the Yellow Crane Tower!"</p>
<p>With a sincere smile, I shook hands with General Lu and said goodbye.</p>
<h3>Learning to Cry</h3>
<p>— Yi Chu</p>
<p>It seems someone once said, "Crying is a sign of weakness." Yes, when two children fight, the weaker one will surely lose, and if they lose, they will surely cry. From this, we can prove that the statement "crying is a sign of weakness" is correct, so why should we "learn" it?</p>
<p>However, clever people say that crying is a way to conduct oneself and a secret to success. Their reasoning is that "everyone has a sense of compassion," and the way to move others' compassion is through "crying." They also cite a large number of successful figures, such as Liu Bei, Shen Baoxu, etc., to prove that "crying" is the secret to success. Since "crying" is the secret to success, its importance is evident, and why shouldn't we "learn" it? Then how to learn it? How to "apply" it after "learning"? Let's illustrate with examples:</p>
<p>For example, when you see that people's hearts in society are no longer what they used to be and that social morals are declining, you give a speech in public about ways to remedy the situation, but you must shed a few tears. Or, you publish a paper, but you must not omit the words "alas" (or "ah" for a more Westernized version) because that's how people will be moved and give you the title of "moralist." When you encounter refugees on the street asking you for money, you can turn your head and walk away—the faster you walk, the better. However, when you return home, you must compose a few ancient or modern poems of "grieving for the people" or "crying for the suffering compatriots" in a "level-oblique" tone and use a classic quote such as "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are bones of those who have starved to death." Publish it in a newspaper or magazine, and people will call you a "poet elder" and give you the title of "philanthropist." When your parents or other elders pass away, you might as well watch a movie or go to a dance hall, but the most important thing is that in the "obituary" or "death announcement" advertisement, you must not omit words such as "weeping blood," even if you are not feeling any pain in your heart. But when you see friends, your eyes must be as red as blood, and when you speak, your voice must be slightly trembling. Then people will say that you are able to "grieve to the point of emaciation" and give you the title of "filial son." Similarly, when talking about national affairs, you must cry bitterly or sob uncontrollably to show that "your patriotism is second to none." Therefore, people will still give you the title of "patriot." ...</p>
<p>If you don't want titles, then is crying useless? No, there are other uses.</p>
<p>For example, when you want to borrow money from someone, you must have a crying face. (If you can really cry, that's even better. If not, you must at least have a crying expression.) Then people will believe that you really have no money and are truly poor. Otherwise, you will surely be rejected and get a face full of dust. If you fail in school, you only need to go to the teacher, cry bitterly, preferably with tears streaming down your face, explaining the reasons for the failure. Then you can pass and be promoted. If you argue with your husband or get into a fight and lose, then you just need to "cry," "cry" to the ancestral altar for an hour, two hours, a day, two days... then your husband will surely be conquered and bow down to your short qipao, obeying your every command.</p>
<p>Since the way of crying came into being, it has spread like wildfire, and everyone is competing to imitate it, putting their own spin on it, creating a gloomy and eerie atmosphere of ghosts crying and gods wailing. Therefore, I take up my pen and declare:</p>
<p>"The way to conduct oneself lies in hypocrisy, and the way to be hypocritical lies in crying. As long as clever people do not die, disasters will not cease!"</p>
<h3>A Plea</h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>Not a low groan, nor a wild roar. Just the tears of our millions of people, flowing into the sea, and from this sea comes the sound like a giant wave. Our millions of suffering hearts—perhaps the most unfortunate. Those whose fates are different have never thought of this heart that has suffered. Who knows that sometimes being subjected to deep pain makes us forget that our bodies are also wandering without support? Who gives us friendly feelings? That's a dream—after all, they have their own destinies, sometimes throwing us a glimpse of sincere sympathy for a moment. However, after turning their heads, they are even more deeply in love with their own destinies. To whom do we appeal? Truth has steadily entered deep valleys, having long forgotten about our group of people.</p>
<p>We are directed to play a tragedy. Truth, has it given us a bit of light? There must be a ray of light in the darkness, as long as it can give us a bit of hope, we can go and explore.</p>
<p>Why should our home become rubble? We haven't had excessive enjoyment inside. Why do those shapeless flesh and blood cover our rice fields? Why take away our beloved child? He won't be hungry, wanting milk, and no longer intimately lean in our arms and cry "scared"? Why let tears be on the tight hug to the already broken arm? …</p>
<p>Truth, illuminate this world again, don’t lightly leave our group of millions of suffering people, give us a ray of hope.</p>
<p>Moored, homeless walking, eternally seasonless wandering. During the blazing hot summer, let the sun mercilessly scorch, sweat soaking the un-dry ragged clothes. There are also big houses there, but we dare not step in because they do not need truth. The days still slip away like this, the seasons are not forgiving to us, and the biting cold wind attacks the body in the dead of winter. What we are wearing is still the ragged clothes worn in the hot summer, although the body is frozen stiff, but there is still a knowing heart that has not frozen to death. This heart is eternally marked with a question: "Is this the judgment of truth?"</p>
<p>Heaven! This is not a curse, because this may be destiny. Looking at the bright and warm places, but we do not have the courage to knock, who is willing to listen to our plea, which door is willing to accept us, the homeless wanderers. Even if the gale blows down the body that cannot withstand hunger and cold, in other people's eyes, it may be equal to a frozen dog.</p>
<p>Who has ever witnessed the blood of their aged parents smeared on sharp knives, collapsing in the rubble in painful groans? Their hearts were as loving as other people’s parents and children, but they encountered encounters that were contrary to reason and emotion, and they never complained that their children were not as good as others, but at the time of their eternal parting, they were still concerned about a thought, deeply afraid that the children suffering on this bloody land would suffer more cruel devastation!</p>
<p>Whenever we are praying for the coming of truth, we feel like something is stuck in our throats, like blood dripping from our hearts. Our deep past becomes a trembling sob, what more suffering awaits us? But we do not expect to die, perhaps at the end of the tongue we will eventually be saved, enduring the pain, holding such hope; after the layers of dark clouds are covered, the sun, darkness will always be driven out of the world one day!</p>
<h3>On the Way Home (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Wang Li</p>
<p>— Is it taking a car?... Are the yellow-clothed people going to the countryside? —</p>
<p>I pondered.</p>
<p>On the road ahead, farmers were fleeing this way in twos and threes. I walked up a mound and looked ahead. Behind a row of trees, black smoke suddenly rose, and then black smoke rose in one place after another.</p>
<p>I asked the farmers who were approaching from the front in a panic and learned that the yellow-clothed soldiers were repairing the destroyed bridge, venting their inherent rage.</p>
<p>I retreated to a small village I had just passed and detoured around the highway in the evening.</p>
<p>The next day, I walked along with a commoner. Along the way, we talked like familiar friends. Every time we encountered a tea shed, we would rest for a while and drink a few bowls of tea or a bit of baijiu (he was a friend who loved to drink).</p>
<p>As we walked down a yellow earth slope and passed the Huangshan Temple, from behind us, probably from the direction of Xiepu, came loud and dense artillery fire.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but over the long years, I have developed a love for the sound of guns and cannons, like the sound of bugles stirring in the morning air.</p>
<p>Listening to the artillery fire, my steps became more powerful. Every particularly loud artillery fire made me feel a sense of indescribable psychological pleasure.</p>
<p>Along the way, the common people were mixed with joy in terror, and terror mixed with joy, anxiously talking to each other or standing blankly, looking towards the distant direction where the artillery fire was sounding.</p>
<p>As the sun was setting in the west, I parted ways with the commoner and went to a small town. (To be continued)</p>
