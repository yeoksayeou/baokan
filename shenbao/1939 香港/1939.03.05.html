<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>日×南進中的太平洋新形勢</h3>
<p>— 胡愈之</p>
<p>太平洋的風波，不是今天開始的。在過去七八年中間，中國首先充了遠東侵略者的羔羊，在抗戰中由羔羊而變為猛虎。但是遠東的大國——英美法荷——却始終苟安退讓。因之侵略者的勢力一天比一天膨大，太平洋的危機也一天比一天增進。</p>
<p>現在侵略者的刀鋒，不單是對着中國，而旦直向着太平洋一切和平國家了。英美法荷各國要苟安也無從苟安。要再向侵略者讓步，就等於自殺。</p>
<p>這是很容易明白的，日本帝國主義在今日的唯一出路，就只有南進。南進可以刺激國內民心掩護在中國作戰的失敗，可以威脅英美法荷，攫取白種國家在遠東的殖民地，可以配合得意的嚇詐政策，貫激反共集團的共同目的，還有最重要的，南進可以切斷中國通海道路，削弱中國抗戰力量，因而實現征服整个中國的幻想。</p>
<p>除開南進之外還有什麼路走呢？雖然日×依然宣佈着在進行反共的「聖戰」。可是張鼓峯的當頭一棒，已經使×子受够教訓，不再想向泰山頭上動土。應付「中國事變」罷，過去為了「估計的不足」，也經吃盡苦頭，二十個月的苦戰的結果，徒然斷送了五十萬軍隊。現在還有近百萬大軍，在黃河長江珠江流域的腹地，被我們的正規軍和游擊隊到處圍困着，切斷着，堵截着，迫擊着。不用說戰局不會在短期結束，而旦要把目前在華的軍隊，安全撤走都沒有可能。</p>
<p>因為對中國作戰已　山窮水盡的僵局，所以日×不能不轉變政略戰略由南守北攻而變為北守南攻，由親英反蘇，而變為同時反英法蘇。換句話說，就是要由大陸進攻，變為大陸與海洋雙方並進。這一新的政策，在决定之前，曾經過數度的試探。去年五月的厦門登陸，十月的廣州佔領，目的都在於試探英法方面起何種反響，結果剛和張鼓峯相反，英法方面態度軟化，試探是完全成功了，於是到了去年十一月三日近衛發表了建立「東亞新秩序」的宣言接看海軍就陸續向華南集中。到了最近海南島的登陸，南進政策積極化，已得到事實的證明</p>
<p>海南島登陸以後，日×立卽進行在瓊崖建立海空軍根據地，並且由國內派遣專家赴海南視察，證明日×有永久佔領的企圖。同時日×又以空軍轟炸九龍新界的英國領土。在上海工部局當局行施威脅，日本海相米內宣佈，除前年開始的八萬萬日圓造艦計劃繼續進行外，將於二月底向議會要求海軍造艦追加預算以與英美競爭。</p>
<p>和這南進政策有密切關係的，是德日兩國數月祕密進行着的軍事談判。這是很明顯的，希特勒需要日本××在遠東拖住英法的脚，也就像需要法西斯意大利在地中海捧住英法的頭一樣。只有這樣德國才可以向英法大敲一筆竹槓，比在慕尼黑所敲更大的竹槓。不過德日兩個法西斯國家，幹的是什麼鬼把戲，在目前是諱莫如深的。只有法國的週刊Vu在一月二十五日透露出一點消息。據稱，德日兩國於去年十一月二十日，在東京簽訂了一個密約，其中規定：（一）日本倘因中國事件而牽入新的戰爭時，德國當以陸海空軍全力援助日本。（二）中國領土內凡日本享有經濟特權的，德國亦享受同樣權利。德國並有權對於「新中國」政府派遣技術及軍事顧問。（三）庫頁島及蘇聯遠東領士，倘受日本管轄時，德國應獲得讓與權。（四）德國得恢復戰前在太平洋的殖民地，但以不損害日本戰略安全為條件。這是密約的第一部份。還有第二部份是規定瓜分馬來殖民地的。德國得佔有荷屬　幾內亞，馬都拉島（Mndera）西郃，西里伯島南部，荷屬西印度的蘇里南（Surinam）還有英屬婆羅洲。但英屬馬來半島到新加坡為止暹羅及其餘荷屬東印度，緬甸為日本勢力範圍。這一個密約中間並沒說到菲律賓，夏威夷，越南，印度，緬甸的分割，據說是因為要留着等待意國參加德日密約的時候，好雷新分配。</p>
<p>這雖然是一個未經證實的報告，但是從七十四屆議會×外相有田再三主張強化反共協定這一點，從德國準備於三月間向英法來一次要求殖民地的新威脅這一點，從英美法荷積極擴充遠東的軍備這一點，都可以看出德日瓜分太平洋殖民地這一淸息不是完全沒有根據的。</p>
<p>自然，法西斯國家這一些挑釁行為，在目前是出於恫嚇的動機居多，因為德國在沒有戰勝的把握以前，是决不願輕易發動戰爭的。日×目前的主要企圖，還是在於征服中國，並沒有立卽向英美進攻的决心，但是遇到一個強盜用實彈手槍相對的時候，誰能担保不發生危險，今天是恫嚇，明天也許是戰爭。總之，太平洋的滔天巨浪，是已經掀起來了。</p>
<p>這已經掀起來的滔天巨浪，不是任何人力所能够平靜下來的。儘管還有些人在幻想，用國際會議來恢復遠東和平，這是比黑狗變白狗還難。因為第一，太平洋問題，現在已和歐洲問題，結成連環；歐洲問題不會和　解决，太平洋問題自然更無希望。第二，英美對侵略國的讓步，已到了最後限度，要是英帝國不甘心立時崩潰，美國還想保持遠東的投資和貿易市場，要再向侵略國退讓是不可能的。第三，法西斯國家奪取太平洋上的霸權，正是炙手可熱的時候，儘可以硬敲和軟騙，雙管齊下，但斷不會輕易放手。第四，遠東最主要的國家，中國——在抗戰中已走上獨立餌放與復興的途徑。有×無我，有我無×，這中間早已沒有妥協的餘地。中國問題非到抗戰最後勝利不能解决，整個太平洋問題自然更不用說了。</p>
<p>自然，太平洋上一切和平國家一致團結起來，向侵略國實施軍事的經濟的道德的制裁，這樣遠東和平也許還有挽救的一綫希望。可是在太平洋大戰爆發以前，這樣的制裁到底很少可能。現在太平洋各國的統治者，天天打算着的已經不是如何促成太平洋集體安全和和平的問題，而是如何發動或如何應付未來太平洋大戰的問題。</p>
<p>上面已經說過，參加反共協定的德意日三國，正在計劃分割太平洋上的白種國家殖民地。其中日本自然是遠東侵略勢力的先鋒。海南島登陸以後表面受最大威脅的是法屬越南。但這不過是為了政略上戰略上的需要，日×才向法國挑　，法國是遠東殖民帝國中較弱的一環。越南和中國西南抗戰根據地接壤。直接威脅越南就等於加緊封鎖中國和間接威脅英國，可是日×侵略的眞正目的，却不在法屬，而在英屬馬來聯邦，荷屬東印度和菲律濱澳洲。日本工業所需要的橡皮，石油，與其理想的人口移居　都在南洋。而菲律濱的鐵，澳洲的豐富的礦產和羊毛，尤其是日×侵略的主要目的物。所以××南進的路徑，大概有三條：第一是佔領菲律濱，再由菲律濱而進攻新幾內亞與澳洲。第二，是進取新加坡旗婆羅洲，然後囊括馬來聯邦和荷屬東印度。第三是由海南島進犯越南，再由越南併吞緬甸，印度而置暹羅於日本保護之下。但在未來戰爭開始的時期，日×要爭取美國的中立；或者暫時不取第一條路徑，而要首先採取第二條第三條路徑。到那時獵取香港，就等於囊中取物。越南有被侵犯的可能，但是主要的戰鬥却是在新加坡。假如美國不參加戰局，日×至少也要克服英荷聯軍的強烈抵抗才能達到目的。</p>
<p>在這里，日×所依靠的，將是西方法西斯國家的助力。雖然除了空軍參戰和經濟援助之外，德意不會給與遠東的帮兇以什麼有力援助。可是大西洋，地中海，紅海德意的海軍空軍假如對於英法能起重大牽制作用，那麼日×就比較更有戰勝把握了。日×目前迫切需要加強反共協定，原因也就在這里。</p>
<p>除此以外法西斯侵略者還打算從半封建半殖民地的暹羅，作為進攻英法屬地的一個重要據點。目前暹羅政府是在法西斯主義的影響之下。暹羅的國務總理鸞比布（Luang　Pfbul），去年在廣播演說中公開宣佈崇拜希特勒和莫索里尼。最近德國國防軍機關報Deutsche　Wehr也說『暹羅倘和日本訂結同盟，法屬越南的安全，就完全破壞了』。日×的特務機關近年在暹幹了很多的鬼把戲，暹羅的親日，本是十分明顯的。因此對於這東方小國的列强政治外交鬭爭，關係是非常重大的顯暹羅假如成為亞洲的匈牙利，不但越南不保，而且緬甸和新加坡，也隨時有被侵略的危險了。</p>
<p>在日×南進政策和法西斯集團侵略陰謀圍攻之下，英法荷蘭的殖民地已在強敵刀鋒之下。英法荷蘭將取什麼方針保障在太平洋的領土安全呢？</p>
<p>雖然張伯倫的外交只知道向侵略者退讓，在西方和東方都一樣，但是在最近也開始覺悟非用武裝來維持和平不可了。英國要是用武裝維待和平，不用犧牲小國的方法維持和平，和平還是可以維持的。為了共同對付國際的殺人犯，英國一定能得到美國和蘇聯的合作。尤其是抗戰中的中國，是遠東和平最大的支柱。英國政府遲早一定要明白這一點：只有用一切力量支持中國抗戰，制裁日本侵略才能保全在遠東的廣大殖民地。即使目前還不明白，事寶會敎張伯倫明白的。至於法國的遠東政策，和他的西班牙政策犯同樣的錯誤：想在「中立」這一柄破傘下躱避風雨，結果只便宜了侵略者現在越南在侵略者的三面包圍中。法國已在積極增強遠東的陸海空防務。海南島對面的岡朗海灣（Bay　of　Can　Ranne）正在建築一等軍港。無疑的，法國的遠東政策，是要跟着英國而強化的。至於荷蘭在軍事上也不能不倚賴着英國。直到最近海牙才通過了大規模的造艦案，這是遲了些，但還算是太遲啊。</p>
<p>羅斯福的遠東政策是完全正確的。在最近數月中間，發表了多次反侵略的演說，在利馬建立了汎美反侵略陣線的基礎，向議會提出了關島設防案和四年擴軍新預算案，羅斯福已經看到法西斯侵略者是美國唯一的敵人。雖然關島設防案，還不能在議會通過。這是由於侵略者的劍鋒還沒有觸及美國，所以財閥所控制的孤立主義者，　保有一部份力量。可是美國的太平洋政策終于要放棄孤立主義，而採取更遠大的反　略路線，是可以斷定的。</p>
<p>在日×侵略由北進轉為南進的今日蘇聯的遠東地位，一天比一天增强。在太平洋的巨浪中，只有蘇聯成為和平的中流砥柱。這是誰也不能否認的，决定法西斯侵略勢力的崩潰與和平力量的最後勝利的，蘇聯的強大與進步，是一個最主要的因素。</p>
<p>但在目前，太平洋問題槓桿，乃是中國的抗戰。正因中國堅持抗戰到底，自力更生，所以侵略者的一切軟騙硬敲，都必然要全部失敗。正因中國是為民主和平而抗戰，所以太平洋各民族，將因中國抗戰的勝利，而享受民主與和平。太平洋問題是因日×破壤中國領土完整而直接引起的，必然要在中國戰勝日本收復失地之後，才能得到持久的合理的解决。</p>
<h3>一個血和淚的紀念大會</h3>
<p>— （東江特訊）　林衡</p>
<p>一、跑上飛驚嶺</p>
<p>今天的太陽已給烏雲掩避了一半了、然而它的餘威還從東方射至西南、射釗惠州城西湖邊、把嚴　、優雅的惠州中學全景美麗地照出在西湖水面、對岸是一個中國式的小花園、梅花方謝低頭暗示着小烏和蜜蜂叫她加緊活動、花園的中間直立兩座小洋樓、洋樓的左邊是紅泥公路、公路旁的樹葉沒有新加上泥塵、分明公路久已沒有車轉行走、</p>
<p>在那座較大的洋樓樓上、中間有一個大廳、正面貼着用紅墨水寫成的「抗日高於一切」六個大字、兩旁貼着「積極工作加緊學習」『緊張嚴肅活潑團結』十穴個大字、報吿處貼生活日程、正對面是活　、右邊是新作風的信條、左邊掛着許多張抗戰歌曲、「多麼嚴肅的工作廳呀」、記者與奮地說着、</p>
<p>時鐘剛剛嚮了十一吓、這廳中便照例的擠着數十個年輕活潑的靑年、「時間到了我們出發吧？」一位看來只有十三歲的孩子、這樣向其他的同伴提議、「好！立卽出發」有人嚮應了這個號召、接着、人羣開始移動、</p>
<p>三五成羣、笑的笑、跳的跳，人羣沿着惠樟公路向南流、有人在談笑、「馬溜仔』跑上被燬在道旁的汽車、飾走不動的汽車的駕駛夫、同時有此此人表現得非常莊嚴、他們在想着『一·二八』的革命史實、看着倒入湖理的汽車、湖的中央出現幾隻游泳自如的水鴨、好像在向奴隸們示威、又像在吿訴被壓迫者：「自由解放是多麼寶貴！』</p>
<p>公路把西湖隔、中間的橋樑被××炸斷了、路旁有數不盡的血跡、湖邊浮起軍帽和破衣、行行重行行、忽然飛鵝嶺出現在目前、幾個打先鋒的「小鬼」已在嶺頂上唱歌了、這一羣靑年、用競賽的方式、誰也不欲當烏龜、一齊跑到了山頂、</p>
<p>二、在堡壘面前</p>
<p>巡視堡壘戰績之後、紀念會開始，</p>
<p>天色還是依舊的不明朗、太陽的　威很懦弱、揭不了烏雲的掩避、使太陽照耀下的大地整個的沉悶起來、微風從西北吹來使大地上的人們感覺到寒　、</p>
<p>大會始唱黨歌、整個空氣都跟着嚴肅起來、接着主席宣佈紀念會的意義、報舍「一、二八」抗戰史實、聽衆跟着史實的悲壯而興奮緊張、</p>
<p>正在主席報吿得最憤激的時候、大家忽然看到何君用沈重的步調、一步一步的朝會塲前進、當他愈走愈近的時候大家都很淸楚地可以看到他的面孔、他太悲奮了、他的面孔早默吿訴大衆他在悲傷、在煩惱司時又是憤激，所有的人的視線都集中到何君的身上、記者開始懷疑自已的記憶力「在國會前何君不是說他因工作太忙不能參加紀念會嗎、為什麼現在又趕來」、許多人都用奇異的眼光看着他、知道他是受到了很大的刺激了、渴望着他說話、</p>
<p>「各位同志、」何君會意地開始說話了、「我太與奮了、我有許多工作要回去做的、但是當我下山的時候、我看見了整個的惠州城、東江和西湖環繞着她，惠城太美麗了、太可愛了、山明水秀的風光吸引我停止了脚步、」跟着他的性急的個性、他不繼續推寫那美　的河山了、他往下說出他要說的話來、一忽然我囘想剛才看到的血跡和破衣、堡壘中戰士的胸章破爛的軍旗、情感…」他說到這兒的時候、聲帶開始頗動、心兒跳動的速度也隨着增加、其餘的人都全受感動了、「情…感…要我向後轉……我不能不參加今天的紀念會呀、」淚珠已充滿了何君的眼腔、他的聲音充滿了悲奮的情調、楊「小鬼」開始哭了、多半的人眼兒都紅了，「同志們、陣亡的將士太英勇了、英勇地犧牲了、我們要誓死為民族戰士：報……仇…」小停了一會何君還繼續着、同志們，我號召大家再看一看堡壘、要入堡壘裏面……看戰士們遺下的皮帶、背心……看完才出來站在堡壘面前致敬……長…長時間的致敬…」何君伶止了說話、會場寂靜下來、李君、王君、陳君都哭了、過了一會譚君首先打破默靜的空氣，『同志們、我們應當響應何君的號召一齊到堡壘中去」、大家靜靜的向後轉身就走、沒有人作聲、只能聽鞋與草磨擦而成「切切」的微音、</p>
<p>「看吧、這是戰士們的遺衣哦、……」何君一面說一面用「士的」指着、沒有人囘答、空氣還是死一般的寂　、——</p>
<p>吳君自個兒走着、忽然覺得奇怪起來「同志們都到那兒去了、為什麼一些聲色都沒有呢、……」不管一切吳君低着頭曲着身從堡壘的鋼鬥口踏進去、　乎他的意料之外、所有參加大會的人幾乎都擠在這裏、然而依然沒有人作聲、</p>
<p>『這是防毒藥水呀！』「這是火藥」過了妤久才有人在低聲說話、</p>
<p>「看吧！這是戰士們的筆記薄……給殘酷的炮彈碎片打穿了、但是還可以看見許多字呢……</p>
<p>「第一章——秘密通訊一般動態（以下所錄為保持眞實性不修改——記者）</p>
<p>「各國在在爭的準備中最活動的是刺探敵情的工作了、……表面上用各種的術語……又用音樂上的（以下字被炸彈片炸掉了——記者）……或用植物上的名字以為種種代……是用化學藥水寫成……要把藥水洗滌之後就可……巧妙的則藏於特製的橡皮彈丸中、在急的時候可以吞入腹內、事過之後再吃一種藥水便可以重吐出來……</p>
<p>「日本的間諜綱不單已經控制了全中國而且威脅了全世界……星光同盟、血盟豐……龍會此皆日本秘密團體之稱號……日本外的間謀工作是直接受陸軍參謀部第二科支配、海軍則受海軍總參謀部的管理……」</p>
<p>靦擦了堡壘後大家走出來了、何君又用「士的」指着堡壘說、「你看、這是　好的經驗敎訓、在堡堡斜波上不能置泥士、泥土給槍打落來適合塞住了槍口機關不便活動……」</p>
<p>「好！現在我們大家就立正在堡壘面前致敬吧！」</p>
<p>「在致敬的時候我們要想！　！想　戰士們怎　地英勇的犧牲了、我們要想！想！想！怎樣鍛練自已為戰士報仇！（聲音顫動起來）一跟着君　君作道樣的補充、</p>
<p>三致敬—英抗戰將士</p>
<p>致敬、　勇的抗戰將士、敬禮開始、</p>
<p>天色還是依舊的不明朗、空氣更加寂靜和沈悶、遠處付來孩子的叫喊、配合着靑年人的熱淚打到地上的音響與緊急的呼吸聲相應　、空氣更加悲慘了、彭君欲奇心大、於是舉頭遠望、在別一　嶺上有兩松樹隨着風在　動、好像也在那兒點頭向戰士致敬、收囘視線彭君看見、頓同志哭得最悲慘、所有的人都哭了、大家充滿着悲傷、憤恨、激昂的情緒、這情景很難描寫，作算世界上最偉大的藝術家也只能描寫於萬一、再轉視　、彭君看見譚同志手拿着戰十的鋼帽視線集中在帽子裏面、很像想在裏面找出些什麼的樣子、</p>
<p>在沈悶的空氣中行禮、在沈悶的空氣中禮畢、何君情不自禁地又發出悲壯的聲調；</p>
<p>「……我哭了、我為什麼哭呢？戰士們的英勇激動了我、我自想我的工作姿態還不及陣亡戰士的……英……勇……我要誓死踏着將士的血跡、為民族報仇！（聲大而壯）、』</p>
<p>『各位同志」：阮女士搶着說：「……我們哭…哭是不够的……我們要×人用血債來償還血債！……我們要加緊學習一切鬥爭技術、這是我們殺敵的條件！……」阮女士幾乎眞的瘋狂了，大家憤怒的情緒，更加增高了！</p>
<p>停了一會大家不作聲，何君再來一個號召大家到對面山去視察堡壘，沒有人響應，但人羣却開始跟何君移動，突然有人低聲說，「我以為對面的堡壘，還是改天視察吧，今天我們應當繼續開會。」還是沒有人回答，沈靜了一會，何君牧回提議，大家便坐下來，紀念會繼續下去。</p>
<p>首先是陳報吿「一·二八』歷史事件、『一·二八』的經驗教訓、續着要求每個人都發表意見、感想用此來充實大會的內容、</p>
<p>奇督極了、又是一場寂靜、首先打破靜默的空氣的還是兩個小同志、繼着是頓君站起米、「我今天很不舒適頭痛、但到了堡壘之後使完全好了……我……心跳流淚……但我　用這憤怒的心情誓死趕走日本鬼、來一個大笑來償還今天的　苦』、接在賴君之後是李淸塋的演詞，、李潔貞的演說……</p>
<p>手提鋼帽譚君站起來、非常嚴肅地說、「我一生也沒有像今天這樣的感動過、我的心跳、跳得不可再跳　、再跳使會窒息了……這鋼帽我們要保重它、這裏而有戰士的血跡、用手指着帽子譚君突然呈現出悲痛的表情、用振動的聲帶他繼續他的演講、我們要將我們的血加到帽子裏、與裏面的血共同奮鬥、爭取民族解放的勝利……我們要以最大的努力來打擊那些尚來接受血的敎訓的賣國賊汪精衛和一切漢奸以報答死去的戰士……我說這一點只能設出我所欲說的話的百分之一、』　（未完）</p>
<h3>重慶的「姑姑園」</h3>
<p>— 知我</p>
<p>「廚子老太爺」的史實</p>
<p>（續昨重慶航訊）</p>
<p>老太爺的約法，無論是誰，到姑姑園飲宴，身份　能高於他、也不得看卑了他，尤其不能看他作普通的廚子，「塔大的光棍』，『位高的公　』　入座之前，須得向老太爺招呼一下，最低限限度也得說聲：『老太爺你來喝盃　，這首座虛位等你坐呢！老太爺照例囘答一句：「不行，我還忙着呢！你們先吃罷！』這樣作做過去，老太爺站在一傍，每一種菜來，他必定要直呼客人的姓名，絕無先生，老爺，女士，太太的尊稱，如同『老太爺』對子女輩訓示一般，問你「這　菜你明白嗎？你知怎做法嗎你吃着好嗎？』你這時也必須起身對答：『是，老太爺，我們吃着很好，就是不明白怎樣燒法？』老太爺聽見你的回答，照例又要如同長者訓誨卑幼，詳細為你講說一遍，你一壁吃，一壁聽，並須一壁贊不絕口，表示你眞止領略了菜的做法，破題兒第一次吃過，這樣麼，老太爺歡喜，你也被引為入幕之賓了，不然的話，老太爺不會高你的興，下次也自然享你閉門羹，任是如此的麻煩早微，好奇的人，好嘗試的人，仍然趨之若驚，鑽頭設法的求吃一頓。</p>
<p>材料費照例是先惠，菜肴的配合好歹，不容你置啄，開賬一百，你不得給九十九，今天你若筵客，得先三四日跑去和「老　爺」商洽，「老太爺」回說沒功夫，那是拒絕　了，你得「免開尊口」。如果你長於詞令，在路上遇見老太爺，遠遠的笑臉迎去，鞠躬如也，問一句，一老太爺你有功夫嗎？給我帮帮忙，我打算在你那裏招待幾位貴客」，老太爺聽見你說要招待貴客，必定停步問你所請的客人姓名，認為可以，則道：「要得，你明天來罷！」</p>
<p>除卻「吃」外，你在『姑姑園』必得鑑賞一下老太爺乎寫的「黃庭經」，和四壁滿懸的字畫，鑑賞時節，嘴裏能發出一種「昨咋」稱美的聲音，那是極得體的了，否則會被老太爺視為「俗傖』。</p>
<p>有時「廚子太爺」也應邀到你家裏做菜，、那得看你的身份地位如何。倘他應諾你的邀請，手續是這樣，必得由主人備具請柬一份，「請老太爺某月某日閱第光臨到某處便酌一。「第光臨」四個字，是絕不能少的，因為老太爺去的時節，隨同前往的猶有老爺的姨太太，大小姐，娘姨僕婦等人。單請「老太爺」而無闔第字樣，是被老太爺認為不恭敬，無誠意。聽說「老太爺』「姑姑園」的命名，就是凡是燒菜等事，除了「老太，」外，姨太太，大小姐，姨娘僕婦也要動手的，「老太爺」旣為人尊敬了，一人得道，鷄犬飛昇」，循着此種定義，姨太太，大小姐不妨自尊為「姑姑」，到那裏吃飯的人，不能挑剔這個字眼，不認她們是一姑姑」，也得强認為「姑姑」，為吃名菜，少不了晚下一輩。特別一榕事，『老太爺』領着闔第眷屬，光臨你的府上，來去必得汽車接送，沒汽車是諸般皆備也不去的。</p>
<p>菜究竟燒得怎樣？有的人批評「輕凈爽口」，有的人批評「莫明其妙」，也有的人批評「沒有什麼特別一。反正天曉得，是菜一廚子老太爺」燒的，味道好壞不好談，祇是老太爺，「縣尊太爺」能肯下廚房煮作，就這一點許多人認為已值得一吃為豪了。曾有人不識趣，問過「老太爺」你的菜為什麼要那樣貴？聽說「老太爺」最不高興這句話，他的回答祗是「做菜是消遺，村料不同於衆，須得先二三日預備，一桌筵，至少得宰鷄五六隻，單是鷄湯一種，也得燒她二日，別的不消講了。」</p>
<p>國府遷到重慶，政府官吏，很多醉心「老太爺」的大名，不吝鉅費，到「姑姑園」一筵，「老太爺」自抬身份，每日抵承應一桌，多則不做，所以每有託人介紹許久，而輪不到一席的。蔣委員長年前到重慶，聽見此風，曾經手諭各院部長官，不得再有吃「姑姑圍」奢靡之舉，有幾位次要的角色，且因吃一頓　被懲處。但任是蔣委員長怎樣的禁締，仍然有人偷偷摸摸的去吃，「廚子老太爺」身份也絲毫水降。</p>
<p>一月十五日×機來重慶轟炸，「老太爺』年鴻禁不得驚恐，一次受嚇下，心臟痲痺　症復發，臥床只兩日，竟壽終正寢，膾灸衆口的『姑姑園』也隨之倒閉。</p>
<p>成都尚有『廚子老太爺』的一位弟弟，開設一爿『古女菜』酒館。尚有「老太爺的一位二少爺，開設一爿「不醉無歸」小酒家。這都是襲承「廚子老太爺」的餘緒，而以『姑姑園』特別風雅川菜相號招的。但終不及老太爺之作風雄　磅薄也。　（廿四日，重慶）</p>

　　上述湘西三大問題：難民應如何積極組訓？傷兵應如何妥為管理？，責任機關及社會人士，巴多論列，政府果欲下决心去解决，實不難收水到渠成之功。其餘土匪問題。比較固然是很嚴重，然當前正值神聖抗戰，急劇進展的時代，亦不無因勢利導澈底解决之可能。我們知道，土匪幷不是不可改換行為的份子，也幷以是完全不可使用的人民，在某種意義上，他們固是壞的，但在另種意義上，他們也適于作民族戰爭用的。關外白山黑水之間，燕趙　歌慷慨之地，及大江南北，太湖流域一帶過去和現在極其活躍的游擊隊中，卽不少此輩綠林英雄的化身，勇敢參加作戰，以建立不世的殊勛。再說遠一點，過去的中山先生運用各種會帮做革命的勢力，三湘先賢左宗棠利用帮人之平定新彊，其作法亦何嘗不是社會上原有之一種潛在逆流，設法把它轉　成於大時代有用的正流。　　地方政府對於湘西土匪，過去雖曾部份地採用招撫方法，但疎忽政治敎育工作，結果不但未能將其本性潛移默化，反使它得在一種護符之下，暗中大幹其違法勾當，今後對症下藥的辦法，好在他們已有「不搶抗戰軍人」的善意動　，我們亟應該用政治手腕，針對着他們這點可寶貴的動機，加以善誘安撫和收編，將其「不搶抗戰軍人』的動機，擴大而為不搶抗戰的全民和全國，更進一步採取積極態度，以共同參加實際上的抗戰行動。我想同是黃帝子孫，他們且不少有血性的男兒，只要招撫措施得當，問題確不難迎刃解决。　　此外還有個比較切實的根本辦法，這是三湘人士某君的具體建議：「設法疏迪河渠，調濟食糧之供需（各縣食糧市價不一，例如常德上白米每石售價十二三元，在上游三四百里之沅陵一帶僅值四五元，再上游更降至二三元，一則毅賤傷農，一則漸感米荒，均以交通不便，無法調濟），予人民以最大之民主自由，普遍發動人民組織；更緊要者，為加强政治工作，尤以自衛團之政治作，更加刻不容緩！』可知解决問題的關鍵。萬派歸宗，仍在政治動員，我認為政府實應下最大决心照這樣去幹！蘇日緊張　邊境又有衝突　長春傳來消息　　【路透社長春四日電】今晨滿洲里以北一百二十英里之「滿洲國」邊境兵站、發生衝突情事、死蘇聯兵士十一人、聞邊境情勢、已更趙緊張、</h3>

於僑滬各國人民，亦屬一種重大威脅，斷難忍受！而且工部局對日繼續退讓與服從的結果，表面似乎可以防止日方實行軍事的劫奪，暫時保全租界的存在，實際則恰恰中了日方投機取巧　詐的陰謀，日方垂手而取得在廣大租界內的統治權之後，更進二步的推進冒險侵略行動，亦為必然的趨勢，這在上海租界當局，决必不致如此糊塗。不過鑒於罷湖事件中日方居然進備僅以二萬元作為『誤炸』賠款，而英方竟樂於繼與討論香港及整個華南問題，則又可知妥協政策不從根打消，「上海協定」非不可能，我們不僅要喚起上海同胞及各國備民的警備與抗議，更希望其他各地同胞與各國僑民應有同樣的警備與抗議，直到英國妥協政策的澈底廢棄為止。美購機法案　衆院一致通過　陸空軍預算亦修正通過　參議員主接濟非侵略國　　【中央社華盛頓四日電】衆院昨通過法案、准撥五萬萬元、為陸軍部添購飛機七百八十四架之用、衆院昨討論本案時、并無提出修正案者、故能迅卽通過、幾造成未有之新紀錄、投票結果、未有紀錄、顯係全體一致通過、此項法案為羅斯福總統擴充空軍案之一部份云，　　【中央社華盛頓三日電】羅斯福總統于本年一丹十二日所提出之國防咨文、內說明海陸空軍擴充計劃、所需全部經費共五寓五千二百萬美元、空軍所需之三萬萬美元亦在其內、頃由衆議院用舉手法，（將决此一部份修正通過、並將原定經費四萬五千萬美元、提高至四九九·八五七·九三六美元、業已移送參議院討論云、　　【路透社華盛頓三日電】美國參議院外交委員會將於三月中開始聆取中立法問題之意見、聞共和黨參議昌尼氏屆時將提議無論平時戰時、均實行完全禁止軍火輸出、惟衆信此種極端見解、當不能獲得多數擁護、民主黨參議員湯姆斯則提議中立法應稍有自由、卽美國軍火僅供給非侵略國家、此項提案似較有受多數議負擁護之希望也、參議員洛根力主　援助英法　　【中央社華盛頓四日電】民主黨參議員洛根、昨在參議院發表演說、主張除犧牲人力一點應竭力避免外、美國應以其他一切可能之方法、援助英法、俾兩國可以代為鞭撻獨裁者、至於中立法、亟應早日廢棄、民主黨參議員華爾施卽起立發言、竭力表示反對、謂舉世滔滔、熟者合乎正義、熱者有背公道、其决定之責、不在美國、共和黨參議員瓊森亦起立斥責政府之政策、謂美國外交政策、有兩僩原則、係屬神聖不可侵犯、第一、美國人民不欲對戰爭、但防禦的戰爭為美國人民所不敢辭、第二、任何約束諒解協定或同盟條約、其結果致使美國捲人他國之糾紛者、俱非美國人民所欲知、瓊森繼斥羅斯福總統及外委會主席畢德門提倡美國對侵略國實施經濟制裁之議、謂吾人現日惟以轟炸無辜婦孺之慘酷為言、熟不知舉世悲慘之事莫過于嬰孩之飢餒云云、敵乎！友乎？　德日圖訂　經濟協定　　德日貿易不平衡　日企圖加以補救　　【中央社柏林三日電】德國經濟界對於德日兩國訂立經濟協定之議、甚為積極、咸謂雙方在政治上、旣保有睦誼，自廳在經濟上更加鞏固、是以訂立經濟協定、與雙方睦誼之自然發展、實互有關聯、聞兩國政府進行談判、已非一日、其目的不在締結普通之商務協定、而為一種性質廣泛之經濟協定、此外德日經濟界均贊成將變方現行貿易數額、予以增加、因截至目下為止、德國貨物之輸往日本者、較之日本貨物之輸入德國、其總數計多四倍、今日本希望一面將雙方貿易數額予以提高、一面將雙方貿易比率自四比一改至一比一、此間主管方面則稱、德國準備竭其全力、務必將德日貿易現行之困難予以消除云、日人眼中的列強援華觀  世長譯　　日本清澤清原著·載二月號東京中央公論　　這是不可否認的事實，近來英，美，法三國，對於日本在中國推行的政策，表示不滿，互相維持密切的聯緊，採取積極的行動，反對日本；雖然，各方面對於這種行動的限制和其效力，有秤種不同的意見，這是千眞萬確的事實，速英，美兩國政府也公開的承認了，試舉一個例來說吧：美國的中立法規定，在沒有得到總統的特准之前，禁止貸欵予交戰國家，但是，不久以前，華盛頓方面以信用放欵二千五百萬美金，貸予中國，所以，這僩舉動是美國執行具有系統的反日政策的一部，决不可以作為普通的商業交易看待的。　　列强向日本施行壓力。採取兩種方式，直接的和間接的援助蔣介石將軍領導下的中國政府，這種情形是很明顯的。同時，這種援華方式，又可以分為武力的和經濟的兩類。　　英、美、法、蘇諸國，對於這種種的援華方式，不一定是互相一致的。蘇聯在援華反日的行動上·採取獨立的態度；法國祗是跟着英國走，無論是在遠東，或是歐洲。所以，這些國家究竟會採取怎樣可能的一致行動，對付日本，實在是最重要的問題。　　這是確實的，英美兩國　堅持『門戶開放』和『機會平等」的原則上，完全一致；不過，在推行政策而取實際行動時，兩國的意見就分歧了，囘憶「九一八」事變的時候，當時的美國國務史汀生，督促英政府，和美國採取一行動，反對日本；但是，當時的英國外相西門，並不接受這僩勸吿，同樣的，在這次中日戰爭的初期，英國外相艾登，曾經進行各種活動，引導美國和英國，一致向日本施行壓力；但是，因為美國政府冷淡漠然的態度，艾登的努力，仍舊不能成功，直到最近，英，美兩國才一致的要求遵守中國「門戶開放」，關於這個問題，美國的熊度，比較英國的，尤為積極。　　目前，英，美兩國一般的反日情緒，很是高漲，但是，這並不是表示央，美有立刻用武力對付日本的可能性。它們現在竭力的擴充軍備，這是向日本施行的消極方面壓力。在短時間內，它們是不會採取武力干涉的積極行動的。　　英國的五年擴軍計劃，開始於一九三七年，經費十五萬萬鎊，現在已經進行到第三年·本年更廢欵二萬萬鎊，擴充空軍的實力；此外，又建造軍艦四十五艘（總噸數三十三萬五千噸），並增强新加坡海軍根據地，及另造四萬鎊大戰艦兩艘——這種種都是對付日本的直接壓力，在另一方面，英國余在錫蘭東岸建築海空軍根據地外，更計劃發展澳洲的飛機工業，以完成太平洋方面堅强的防務。　　美國的海軍政策，比英國更為積極，本年一月五日，在羅斯福總統送交議會的咨文中。國防預算達十六萬萵另一千萬美金。海軍當局也督促議會在阿拉斯加和阿里辛羣島方面，建築海軍根據地，增强珠港，中途島，關島等地的防務，和在太平洋的重要據點，建築潛水艇根據地。　　這是無可疑慮的，英，美在太平洋區域的擴軍，增加了對日的壓力；英，美兩國在相互的諒解下，密切合作，也是顯而易見的。但是，武力對付日本的行動，還沒有達到。所以，它們應付日本的方法，祗有下列兩種：援助中國政府，和對日經濟制裁。　　英國下院在上年通過了貸華信用放欵案。英政府更想擴充滇緬路，和新加坡聯繫，以抗衡日本的商業進展，很凑巧的，美國也以鉅欵貸華。在滇緬路也有鉅額的投資，並且帮助中國中央銀行，穩定外匯。至於軍火的供給，是盡人共知的，今後當更有增加的趨勢。　　對日　出口貿易的經濟制裁，是很重要的一種壓力，雖然，日本必需原料的三分之二，由英，美輸人，但是，英，美要想制止羊毛，棉花等物的出口，在實際上，簡直是不可能的。目前日貨出口到英，美兩國，已經受到相當的限制，美國已停止飛機和軍火運往日本，而且準備討論修改中立法，如果討論的結果，’認汽油是軍火的一種，日本一定要遭遇嚴重的影響。關於日本出口貿易方面，盛傳英國的海外領土和殖民地，對於日貨，要採取不平等的待遇；美國也想廢除日，美商約，以阻止日貨的入口，但是，美國和日本在商務上的關係密切，利益龐大，這是不能輕易實施的。　　總之，英，美諸國現在是帮助中國，反對日本的；不過，日本還沒有發生嚴重的影響，今後的演變，唯有時間來决定了。</p>

<p>電影戲劇三八節中　婦女與影劇男性中心社會中　影·劇的女性中心觀  胡春冰　　（一）　　從生物學的觀點來解釋電影與戲劇，人類有三種與生俱來的「驅迫』（或說衝動），卽自我　驅迫，兩性的　迫，自衛的迫，是維持人類生產，生存，生長的最基本的力，也是電影與戲劇中最原始最强有力的題材。　　許多歷史上的性格的悲劇，　是由於自我太强，野心太大，在那裏建築「為跌下而浩的塔」。希臘悲劇中因為目大和驕傲，得罪了神或命運，或是為了自己的野心，打着不上算的賬（fighting　a　losing　battle）都是以自我的驅迫為基幹的悲劇。而這「自我」，有時却不是代表個人的而是代表一個地方，一僩階層，一個國家的自私和偏見。Crossing　the　Rubicon的拿破崙，夫婦都不免於難的馬克白特與其夫人，都是這個「自我驅迫」戲劇性的好例證。　　男女歡悅，是藝術上永遠離不開的題目，正如同這個道理，「戀愛是自然玩的詭計，使人迫延續其生存的」，戀愛是戲劇與電影的詭計，千百個戀愛沒有任何兩個完全相同，是永久有新奇有趣味的題材。兩　的驅迫，因為更接近於自然人的生活，在戲劇的Motiva中，它是最水久，最廣泛，而且最多樣的。這力量最多障礙，最容易遇到敵人，最容易參商，換言之，它絕晚離不了社會關係，所以它常常是那樣深刻而動人，從巴黎王子之喜歡　倫起，兩性的驅迫已經成為戲劇與電影中不可或缺的要素了。　　自衛的驅迫是自我的驅迫的對立物，後者是壓迫，前者是反抗。大衆的戲劇，無論所寫的社會問題或民衆問題，他的底裏的力量，無疑地都是自衛的驅迫。　　這三種驅迫並不是機械地孤立着的，因為人生正是這三種驅迫的交織，特別是兩性的驅迫，他的內容更是葛籐着無限的人情，社會相，和鬭爭。男女問題到了戲劇與電影中就更傳奇化了了。　　（二）　　從社會的　點來解釋戲劇與電影，它是不停的不同的鬥爭之紀錄，它反映一個新社會是怎樣地在孕育，舊會是怎樣地在衰微。它描寫　個鬥爭與變化中一個特例，無論它是一僩成功者或犧牲者，由它的血肉的故事中，我們可以把握到這鬥爭的核心。　　這樣子的人物，從聖母瑪麗亞起，就是一個女性。自從人類『文明』以後，男性中心的私有制度社會存在，一切的被壓迫的奴隸中，以女性為最凄慘，她們時時是呻吟犧牲於雙重壓迫之下的。　　戲劇，好戲劇，應該是被壓迫者的喊叫與反抗。因為婦女到現在還沒有得到澈底的解放，所以婦女問題依然是戲劇與電影中最好的主題之。　　（三）　　我們不要忘記，希臘的戲劇中，女子還有着「人一的地位，羅馬？後就成為戲劇　主要的一可欲之物」，直到易卜生之後，才意識地把女子又　囘到合理的地位。　就是說，凡是女子在社會上愈受壓迫的時候。她在戲劇與電影上地位也就愈　要。在封建社會中，她是騎士們擁護的　人（易損壞品），在資本主義社會中，她楚　神（玩偶）；她或是物件或是神仙，這畸形的境遇浩成了戲劇與電影中的她的重要。在社會主義的社會中，女子受的壓迫少，她在戲劇與電影中的地位也合理化了，她是和男性一樣的人。這可以證明…　是男性中心的社會，戲劇與電影中愈是女性中心；到男女能够處在同梯地位共同工作的時候，女　的魔咒必然解除，那時反壓迫，反殘魯和乎文化的强盜的鬥爭，將是最重要中心。　　（四）　　在戰門中的中國，戲劇與電影中之女性中心狀態，依然存立。這有它的社會原因。在光明面，中國新女性吶喊了起來，粉碎了五千年的枷鎖，走到工廠，戰塲，做出了許多英勇的　蹪，　姿態太感人太可愛了。在戲劇中　會發生使「貧夫　，懦夫有立志「的作用，在抗戰，這種女性中心點，是解放中心的另一面。在黑　面，則舊戲中　且的位置比青衣高，青衣的位置凌駕了髪生，電影女明星的包銀比男明星多，那只是表示男性的統治者，依然是把女性當成「可欲之物」，這是對抗戰的逃避或叛逆，絕不是好現象。　　只有抗戰，爭取民族的自由，可以使戲劇與電影從女性中心的畸形變成男女共同工作的常態，也就是說，婦女的解放要從民族解放中去獲得。劇運通訊孤島劇運一周處【續】  緯籃　　這僩學校有優良也有劣點，他們沒有貧苦生優侍辦法，就是借學費給一般貧苦學生，每班暫以三十名為額，不過，全免學費每學期五十元以外，尚須繳交什費保證金等廿餘元。學生畢業以後，須在該校或其　設機關服務若干時候，這雖然有津貼或薪水可取，但一般人以為這辦法太固定了些吧！　　關於舞台技術方面，戰前有一個專租佈景的商店，現在却已經沒有了。有一班努力話劇工作的同志，最近組織了一個『上海戲劇工作服務社』，以合作社的性質，購置佈景，燈光與其他物質的設備，為缺乏舞台設備的小劇團服務，以便利他們的演出，祗取極低綠的代價。這僩服務社已成立三月餘，各小劇團多與之接洽，『盛况』頗為可觀，這可以說是劇運中一件很好的工作。　　七，新興的紅星　團　　繼「上海劇藝院」和「曉風劇團一的終和之後，還有一个大劇團的產生，這就是由影界王逸公，黃天民和吳旭東等創辦的「紅星劇團」，資本約為一萬餘元，已和「皇后劇院」訂了四个月的合同，預備天天演戲每月四部戲，每一个劇演一星期：分三組排演。人材方面已向尤兢，許幸之，吳仞之等接洽祖任編導委員，演員有周旋，夏霞，周起，徐立，蘇澤等，和以明星演藝訓練所排選出來的新人。已于十二月卅日晚起於皇后劇院公演「狂歡之夜」，由胡旭東導演（實際由許幸之導演），賣座頗見擠擁，成績亦很可觀。次第演出的有「人之初」，「女子公寓一長劇，「桃花源」亦在排練中。這個劇團雖然當時曾一度轟動話劇界，而對孤島劇連有相當的貢献，但為過份從商業化上决定其經營方針，太着重於『職業化』的實行，工作的態度上不大認眞，所以在演出的藝術水準上是沒有什麼高度的成就的。　　八，戲劇刊物和新劇本　　上海最近數月的戲劇刊物遠不如　的了，「戲劇什誌」于九月創刊後，以一毽理論，報道和介紹的姿態出現着，但內各似嫌幼稚一點；每月一册，至今已出板至第五期了。直到十一月廿日，創刊號的『劇塲藝術』出版了，他是个專介紹外國戲劇理論和劇作的月刊，內容非常精彩，理論也很嚴正，尤注重於舞台技術方面的介紹，是一本不可多得的刊物，惜與抗戰現實距離太遠吧！于『導報』上每星期日出版的『戲劇』也很充實，而尤注重實際的理論；此外，大美晚報上每星期六出版的『週末』常登載話劇方面的稿：申報上　日的『遊藝界』，亦常登載劇運訊息。現在還有一個戲劇刊物『四十年代』，正在籌備中，怕當此文章刊出時，他也誕生了。　　從抗戰後，出版界受了極大的損害，因此劇本的生產和出版同樣遭受到很大的妨礙，而素來劇本荒的劇壇越見荒凉了。　　最近上海才慢慢地出了幾僩劇本，但都以譯本佔多，這也是為了受上海政治環境關係吧。　　值得介紹給大家的有下列的幾種：　　法國巴若來原著，鄭延毅譯，顧仲彝改編的「人之和』（Topze）為一四慕喜劇，定價四角，此劇前有中華譯本『小學敎員』　　法國羅曼羅蘭原著，李健吿改譯的「愛與死的搏　』（Le　geu　dee　A　etelaMoat）為法國革命史劇，是一很長的獨幕悲壯劇作，定價三角。　　美國奧尼爾原著，范芳譯的新型獨幕劇，「早點前』（Befone　Breabfast）定價一角。按此劇極為新穎，劇中人祇有一女角，上海曾上演，効果極好。　　法國H.　Beegue原著，岳煥譯，『交際花』（Loparfsenne）幕劇，定價五角。　　中國名劇作家尤競留于上海，近以筆名『于伶』出版了『女子公寓』及『花濺淚』，前者是以女姓為中心顯材，上海經演出多次，頗佳，四幕長劇，定價三角半，後者亦已出版，四幕悲劇　　名劇『春風秋雨』作者阿英亦留于上海。近以鷹隼筆名出版『桃化源』一長劇是劇為一寓言式的象徵劇，內容還好，上海已有上演。　　此外還有諾爾老和德著，芳信譯的『私住活』，為一三慕喜劇，和李健吾編譯的「撒謊世家」，亦于最近出版了。　　九，新鬥爭在進行中　　孤島的環境是那樣的困苦，在失去了祖國懷抱底憂撫的土地和人民，都同樣受到難忍的痛苦，然而，土作者底鬥爭却永恆不歇的支持下去的！　　在近月來值得報吿的有以下的訊息：　　光華大學于十二月七八兩日假靑年會公演了「實現的夢」，這是三幕長劇，由吳仞之導演，小鳳，果元良，袁榮湘等分相要角，導演和演員都知名之士，因此演出的成績很好。　　蟻蜂劇社之『放棄』已作首次公演，成績很好，由金鑫導演的，近在開始排練『金錢』一劇，由胡導導演，該社並擬排練第二期劇塲藝術所刊的兩個新獨幕劇，二為藍洋改作的『兩　患難朋友』一為沙蘇所譯的『十點鐘』。　　郵局分儲匯局的雁羣劇團近正排練諷刺喜劇『紳士的請客一及『春囘來了」，還有一個『勃朗科長』等，由偉藍導演，將于二月中旬演出。　　中法劇藝學校近排演鷹隼名著「桃花源」，由任用梁導演。並同時排練吳曉邦編導的歌舞劇「嬰樹花」，崑曲科方面亦當同時演出，故月來『中法』頗見緊張，　　總之，孤島雖「孤」，劇運却漸漸抬起頭來，以一九三八年踏向一九三九年　新的希望之花楚會開得燦爛的！自然，在目前而言，人材劇本和經濟還是感到缺弱的，但可喜的却是大家都肯努力，團結，在這惡劣的環境中。還盡力求上海　自由，于劇卒的選採方面，盡量求有利于抗戰的題材，雖然少數演出仍落後無聊。　　孤島的戲劇工作者底努力是值得欽佩的，在一年來他們流了不少的血汗，現在更同一九三九的新年頭趕去，他們底前途的光明的！　　（附言）作者為此文時，祇在非常匆速中草就，材料的搜集和參考都不很够，難免掛一漏萬錯誤之處，尚希讀者諒之！　　一九三八，一，廿五　　上海黃花崗聯演在進行着　香港話劇界總動員起來  白水　　香港戲戲劇運動從貧乏中進步到健全，從散漫中邁展到嚴肅，這現象是表現香港劇運工作者在抗戰中覺悟的進步，更表現着民族抗戰在向勝利遴進　　為了更廣大的爭取我們工作的領域和聯合陣綫的加强，而尤以怎樣爭取有利的工作環境去配合民族抗戰而揮發圖爭功能是急亟推動和策勵，　　黃花崗民族紀念日的來臨，無疑地對我們是育特殊的意義，以更進步的統一旗幟去號召着杳港劇壇上總動員起來。在最豐富最有鬭爭性的民族革命底素材的劇作下去舉行聯合大公演，是一件富有光榮的工作。　　在中華藝術劇團，香港靑年戲劇協會，廣東劇協留港同人會底號召和發動下，總動員全港戲劇界舉行民族節日聯演『黃花崗』的工作、開始在進行。　　二月廿六日下午一時許，在九龍中華業餘學校底校舍裏，舉行了首次的全港劇團代表談話會。　　那大到的劇團可眞不少呀，中藝，中旅，時代，香港劇協，廣東劇協，鐵流，勒門，蘆烽，業餘，業聯，黑白，丁丑，先鋒，新聲，中華，紅白，自强，螞議，女四聯會，靑年同樂社等廿餘倘社團，像歐　予倩，胡春冰，……等先生也到了，人數達七十餘人，這種充滿熱烈的情緒的劇人底敘會，還是一九三九年開始後的第一次！　　胡春冰先生做了主席，他代表三個發起社團報吿這次籌備工作的過程，然後提出了很具體的意見供給大家去討論。　　每戲劇工作者都是那麼虛心的，坦白而熱情的討論着，無疑，在嚴止而偉大的統一底旗幟下，誰都貢献了最珍貴的意見，最後，幷通過了很多關于聯演的辦法。　　關子這次聯演是為救濟難民而籌賑演出的，故為義演性質，假如這次聯演全部經費由某社團或機關墊出。那麼將來全部收入都由該社團支配賑災，現在更有一個意見就是由大會回各社會名流或各社團募捐演出經費，那麼將來籌得欵項則以聯演大會名義送交慈善機關賑災。這是經費方面的意見，但究竟怎樣，現已由聯演大會的常務會去分頭接洽了。　　這次的演出是採用混合式的聯合演出，因為「黃花崗」這劇本全部是四幕六場【有序幕及尾聲】，演員需要七八十人，後台工作人員也需要達百之數，算起來眞要二百多人了，那麼自然要動員全港戲劇工作者共同起來才行。這次規模宏大的聯演在國內還沒有，在廣州祇有去年演過一次，那麼香港算是創舉了。這種創舉，是令使香港劇運底歷史上有着一頁光榮燦爛的記載！　　為了　作上有負責和有系統，常務理會在那天的談話會中產生了事當選的是：秘書中藝（李化），劇務正主任香港劇協（朱白水），副主任鐵流（左九），總務正主任時代（張熾孫），副主任（翁歌奮），宣傳主任廣東劇協（李殊倫），副主任中旅（　家寶）。這數天來，他們已經開始借中藝為辦事處的開始緊張地工作了。　　因烏『黃花崗』是一個繁重而幕數多的劇本，因此產生了導演團，現已决定貨責導演的人是這樣，盧敦序幕尾聲，李

<p>自由談論通訉的重要性  黃繩　　隨着抗戰的發展和抗戰所課與的需要，作為文化部門之一的新聞事業有了飛躍發展的契機和表現。今日的報章，在消極方面，我們淸算了有聞必錄的濫造主義，認識了從來源上和時代主流上鑑別新聞質素的必要：雖然還做得不够，但總已向這方面面開展。在積極方面，我們主要作了質的提高，希望給予讀者以豐富的滋養，我們不止有新聞，還有暢所欲言的社論和短小精悍的時評；我們不祇有社論和時評，邇有國內外軍政要員和作家的時文和專論；我們也不祗有這些，還有從各在方來，特別是來目戰地的通訊。質的充實的廣度和質的提高的躍進狀態，能這樣的卓越，是從來沒有過的。　　特別值得珍視和强調其重要性的是通訊的發展，抗戰給予通訊發展以動力，報人也用了通訊方式，完成其現階段的最高的任務，同時報章上通訊發展的形勢，配合着自覺的「雜質」排除的努力，鋪築着新聞事業高度發展的大道。抗戰建國事業的發展與成功，部分表現為文化的高度發展和成就册于式的讀物的大量產出和廣泛流布，將減低了報章上登刊「要人」和作家的專論的重要性而地方通訊却依然站着重要的地位，因為唯有報章才能儘速地刊載那以迅速紀錄，報吿各個社會現實事件為主要性能的地方通訊：也唯有此載着結實的有血有肉的活龍活現的地方通訊的報章，才能滿足讀者的「閉門能知天下事」的欲求，和提高讀者的文化修養和認識社會現實的能力；而這正是新聞事業的最高的目標。　　通訊的重要性是沒有人否認的了。在建設事業突飛猛進的蘇聯，正重視着報章的通訊，正重視着通訊員的寫作和修養的訓練。希望各方各面各角落的通訊，具體地報導各地方諸種建設的實况！好的地方，不好的地方，和不够的地方；以促起全國人民對於建設事業的關懷，從而得釗安慰而加强信仰，或予以强化而增厚力量，在抗戰建國中的中國，自然也有着同樣的需要，通訊該被作為一種武器，報導統戰建國的諸種風貌，指示民衆努力方向，以刺激並且發展全國民衆的精神力量。　　然而若果拿這個尺度來看現在一般的通訊，便會覺得那是非常不够的，現在多數通訊，往往便是通訊員的『行紀』，讀者在他們的『行紀』中僅能看到某地方的瑣碎的表面的一枝一葉的情狀，知道他們會見過的軍政要員的零零碎碎的談話的片斷。蘇聯最高委員會主席加里寧氏在『對社會主義農業』報通訊員的演講中有說：『我可以不走出這個房間寫出我們現在所常有的關於每僩區域的通訊。』當我們讀過好些粗製的通訊之後，也不難有這樣的感想，我們常常讀到寫述戰區或準備戰區的『塲景』的通訊；却不容易讀到通訊員差不多參與了戰國，或作了精神的分析和綜合的報吿，我們常常讀到某某會見記的粗略無味的通訊；却不容易讀到槪括某一地方農民生活的材料，從而顯出戰時後方農村風貌的報吿。——所以，通訊員的自我檢討和自我訓練有重大的必要性；同時，當局也該和蘇聯一樣，致力於通訊員的訓練與培養。明興協定  鄭郁郎譯　　從「危險』叢中，　　「安穩」花生長出來了，　　這混雜的種類，　　奇怪得連園藝家也不識，　　它把整個歐洲的視線移助，　　他們叫它做「明興」花，　　這「和平」的植物脆弱又稀　　薄，　　他們却拿它來自誇，　　很小心地保護着，　　恐怕風兒吹壤了它。　　他們給它着了迷，　　把它當作「四强」的長綠樹　　大家稱讚着，　　它把看作一道光輝，　　向着陰霾中射去。　　根兒種得鬆淺雖然可慮，　　但也開放得有點希望模樣　　它是很好，很適合　　供人家欣賞，　　她要靠人工來使他生長。　　他們讚美這華麗的花兒，　　在『四强』園藝會議中，　　他們誇耀他勝過　　日內瓦道傍的樹叢，　　那樹叢現已在枯萎中。　　她底色彩很漂亮，　　她底樣子也很姣美　　但是，很多細看過的人，　　都爽直不客氣，　　他們說不歡喜她底氣味。　　這首譯自三八年十二月份WorldRevlew原題是Phew即極討厭的意思。作者署名Regnard。李長人（續）  麗天　　卜卜卜，得得得！連續的鎗聲，和雜亂的馬蹄聲，交織地愈來愈近了；接着一片沉濁的語聲，也傳到耳鼓。像這樣馬蹄的聲響，好像正徘徊在他們掩蔽着的蔗林附近。約莫有二十分鐘之後，空中×機低飛過了後，馬隊才沒精打采的開始朝着北面的村落去。　　他們從蔗林裏跑出來的時候，快要黃昏了，為避開×人追踪計，迫得變更了方向，穿過了一個荒墟的後面，沿着河邊向西走。因為肚子餓得要發狂，他們都蹲在菜地上發掘藏在泥土裏的番著，拿來充飢。　　槍聲又來了，是疏落的，不是密集的，更沒有馬蹄的聲響，他們只有照樣地蹲在河旁的竹林裏，靜候命運的來臨。　　噓！噓噓！對方的子彈，逼近他們的身旁來了。　　「啊呀！」那位少尉官長，跳了跳後，中彈死去了！他和傳令兵馬上撲下來，擎起手槍，對準着槍聲的來處，連珠地快放過去，實行他們的正當防衛。　　一發一還的槍聲，和一來一往的子彈在空氣中的摩擦聲，彼此交織着。李長人忽然停扳着他的槍機，疑訝地向那傳令兵的耳朵邊說：　　「那邊的槍聲，很像是我們弟兄的駁壳槍聲，大約不是×人的槍聲吧？」　　「我也這樣疑惑着。」傳令兵這樣的答道。　　對方的槍聲，雖然間續地沒有停止。但李長人早已抬起了他的長腰，提高喉嚨喝道。。　　「刁那媽！你是那裏的散兵？快些說來！」　　「呵！呀……我們是×師×團的，你呢？」是廣東土音的答聲。　　隨着答聲的起處。草業的頂上，顯露出兩個神態慌張，一望而知為生長於南方的臉孔來。　　「啊！高佬李？你麼？！……」　　他們四個人，由敵而便為友地，大家拍一拍肩頭，握一握手，走釗那位剛才這樣犧牲了的少尉跟前，大家眼睛對着眼睛，表情上顯出無限會心的悲悼。　　×團的劇個官兵，後來為冀圖追蹤他們擻退的部隊，終於和他兩人分了手，朝着小崗的左邊去了（未完）關於理論鬥爭  余平　　大家常說：我們不但要把身體武裝，還要把腦袋武裝。腦袋武裝起來，就是為的進行理論鬥爭。十八個月的抗戰經驗，證明我們不單是要和×人及其主使的偽軍作軍事的戰鬭，還要進行思想戰爭；「哀莫大於心死』，理論鬭爭是刻不容緩的工作。　　在抗戰的實踐中，常　盡到不容易打發的難題，這便要靠正確的理論想出好辦法來；但參加抗戰的份子包括着不同的黨派，階層，和信仰，各人的思想不會在同一模型中購出來，可是眞理却只有一個，理論鬭爭就免不了。　　也許有人說，在民族統一戰線中，不應有理論關爭，以免磨擦；這不僅是因噎廢食，多少還有點海洛英的味兒。正因為民族統一電線的鞏固和發展。才要加緊理論鬭爭。把存在於統一戰綫內部的垃圾！—一切不正確的，似是而非的理論掃除，才可以使抗×民族統一戰線鞏固和發展。　　理論鬥爭跟學校裏的辯論會不同，辯論會着重的是「臠」，能目圓其說，把人家壓倒，便是冠軍；理論鬭爭却着重在「理」，我們為什麼要和民族失敗主義鬥爭呢？還不是為着人類正義，為着民族解放！　　理論鬥爭，當然不應施行人身攻擊，但我們不是為理論門爭而理論鬥爭，為肅淸漢妤理論還得先從發出漢奸理論的人入手。若不反對漢奸的謬論，實為捨本求末。要知道，發表漢奸理論的人，已入非可理喻之塗。發表漢好理論的人實有其所以發表漢奸理論的根源。　　理論鬥爭可分對內和對外兩方面。予×人的謊謬言論以嚴重的打擊，有系統的批判×人所根據的謬晚，不特可以敎育自己，還是向國際宣傳的一種積極方法，這方面，我們過去實在作得太不够，說到對內的理論鬥爭，那更重要，若不跟漢奸理論和民族失敗主義鬥爭，則所謂最後勝利，就渺乎其小了，每當和平空氣濃厚，謠言紛起的時候，蔣委員長總是針對妥協氣氛而重申抗戰到底的國策，這就是論理鬥爭的具體表現。　　在理論鬥爭裏，千萬不要忘記拿事實的揭發來作主要的武器，不正確的理論是要在事實先生的面前才能現出原形。十八個月的事實不是已經證明我國可以打下去！明明白白的，要唱「和議」，就只好離開抗戰中心的重慶。　　理論是在不絕的鬥爭中才能充實和向前發展，這可從辯變法的矛盾統一律中得到最好的解釋，拿事實來說，我們現在的持久抗戰理論不是經過長期的鬥爭，而更充實起來嗎？要是不跟安協論鬥爭，任其發展，而造成所謂「民意」，抗戰理諭只有滅亡。　　理論鬥爭不是漫無目的，我們的目的是為着抗×，為着獨立，自由，幸福的新中國。　　弄筆桿的朋友們！理論鬥爭的重担是落在我們的肩上啦！客家村  曾兆筠　　九龍南昌街的盡頭，原是一片廣大的荒地，東邊種着三五株魁偉的古松，蔽蔭着底下做買賣的人租休憩的苦力；西邊與及中部。都給莊稼人拿來種植的土地，耕地與耕地的中間，夾着一條蜿蜓曲折的這路，兩旁長着要枯死的野草，路上印上許無鞋的腳跡，這便是外間與客家村交通的孔道了。沿着這條路，彎彎曲曲的走去，經過幾張小橋和橋底淙淙的流水，便可以望到連綿數里形勢雄偉的山嶺，在晨光曦微的時候，那疾駛如馬的浮雲緊緊地擁抱着峻峭的高峯，那一種忽合忽離若穩現的情景，的確令人神往！回憶幼時讀書，有「難見廬山眞面目』的句子，而今戰地的烽煙，把蘆山的眞面掩蓋得倍加難見，朋友，你倘有賞玩「雲語高峯」的雅興的話，則此地的『峻嶺游雲』，雖不及詩中境界那般美麗，但亦可以聊勝於無哩。　　跟着山邊的曲徑走去，一帶高低不齊的茅舍已在面前等待着你。茅舍的後背長着一列疎疎的竹林，細長的竹林，細長的樹葉低低的吻者屋脊。從山麓斜飛而下的瀑布，湍急地在柴門前面急走，因為水道之高低不半，水與石冲擊的聲昔，形成一種抑揚的節奏，有時　「風拂琴弦』；有時似「千軍萬馬」。倘若你懂得客家的方言，和三嫂，七婆之流，借一條板凳坐坐。喝杯「淡水」出產的濃茶，一壁談大說地；一壁聽水流的昔韻，眞個繞樑三日，幾忘此身尚在人間』古人曾有自誇其居住的好處：有「家在夕陽江上邨，一灣流水燒柴門」之句，詩中的景象，不是在眼前活現了嗎？　　村裏的居民，大都滿口土話，你不習慣是聽不懂的，不過這埋的男男女女，大都氣質和平，舉止大方，沒有因你是外方人而有歧視的心理，若果你光顧，他買點東西，或是問問路徑之類，總是堆下一面笑容和你週旋，沒有都市的人們種種鄙劣的習氣，而且還有一點值得稱頌的，就是村中的成年男女都整天忙着工作，沒有一個遊手好閒的人，他們的職業，大概以種菜，養猪，養鷄，鋸木及做泥工的為多，因當終日勞動，都磨練成一副健美的體魄，婦女們不施脂粉，而韻致犬然。那些十七八歲的姑娘，頭上載一頂竹織的闊邊帽子，帽沿垂着一兩寸長的藍布，托襯起嬌紅的兩頰與明媚的雙眸，表現得他們更加美麗，朋友，倘然你禾有太太又正想尋一個終身的侶伴的話，那麼我主張你到這理來物色，總比都市脂粉砌成的現代婦女好得多呀！　　客家村的盡頭，是一片濃厚蒼翠的樹木，相亙偎倚非常親密，是吿訴你不要再貿然前進的意思。森森之前，有一間豆腐店，和一間洗衣店，這理的豆腐因為用山水製成，所以味道特好。至于洗衣的方法，也和外面不同，工人們先將衣服察上了肥皂的在石上便勁的亂打，然後一起放在水塘裏，利用流水偉大的湍激力，洗除污垢，旣簡單　又淸潔，誰說鄉下人不懂得『科學化』的設計？　　若是脚力好，可以攀登山嶺的絕頂，稍定喘息以後，居高臨下遠遠地望去，但見千里江山，一國無涯；海天相接，劃不出大和海的界綫！再把眼睛垂直下望，又是絕嶺危崖，令人心驚阻落，跌下去恐怕連骨也沒！朋友，你要小心，若是「一失足成千古恨」時，你死而有知千萬不要埋怨我，不提醒你呵！　　上面一番話，于客家村的美似乎已說個大概，但還有一點未盡意的地方，就是它底撩人夜色木曾吿訴各位朋友。當明月半　把鄉村的寥寂與秘密照得織毫畢現的時候，這種風光的吸引力。迥非筆墨所能形容，親愛的朋友，要是你想知道的話，非身歷其境不可。若恐可遠迷途，我願意做一個忠實的嚮導。游擊隊嚇退×兵  李金聲　　——戰地見聞之二——　　我軍某部游擊隊，在津浦綫游擊，將鐵橋鐵軌大肆破壞，並與×兵遭遇，殲×三十餘名，×于拂曉以步騎一百多人追踪我游擊隊向某村進犯，這時一個游擊隊員身受重傷，撤退時實不能支持，便權身于山脚下的山溝中，過了不久，遙見×兵追來，一時不易逃去，於是端平槍身，對準×騎，連發三槍，見×兵三名從馬上跌下，三匹馬發瘋似的亂撞起來，頓時×陣大亂，那個遊擊隊員猛烈射擊，並向山谷發射，山石炸裂，滾滾落下，囘聲四起，×不知我埋伏多少，恐怕我軍殺出，紛紛向原路抱頭鼠竄，到了晚上，那個遊擊隊員爬到原隊，詳述遇×經過，聽到的人都轟然大笑起來。</p>

        <h1>1939.03.05</h1>
<h3>New Pacific Situation Amidst Japan's Southern Advance</h3>
<p>— Hu Yuzhi</p>
<p>The storms in the Pacific did not begin today. In the past seven or eight years, China was first the lamb of the Far Eastern aggressors, transforming from a lamb to a tiger during the War of Resistance. However, the great powers of the Far East—Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands—consistently sought temporary ease and made concessions. As a result, the power of the aggressors expanded day by day, and the crisis in the Pacific deepened day by day.</p>
<p>Now, the aggressors' blades are not only aimed at China but are also directly pointed at all peaceful nations in the Pacific. Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands can no longer find temporary ease; to make further concessions to the aggressors would be suicidal.</p>
<p>This is easy to understand: the only way out for Japanese imperialism today is to advance southward. Advancing southward can stimulate domestic morale, cover up failures in the war against China, threaten Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, seize the colonies of white nations in the Far East, coordinate with successful intimidation tactics, realize the common goals of anti-communist groups, and, most importantly, cut off China's access to the sea, weaken China's resistance, and thus fulfill the dream of conquering all of China.</p>
<p>What other path is there besides advancing southward? Although Japan still proclaims that it is conducting a "holy war" against communism, the blow it received at Zhanggufeng has already taught it a lesson, deterring it from stirring up trouble in the direction of Taishan. As for dealing with the "China Incident," it has already suffered greatly due to "underestimation." The result of twenty months of bitter fighting has been the loss of 500,000 troops. Now, nearly a million troops are besieged, cut off, blocked, and bombarded everywhere in the heartland of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins by our regular and guerrilla forces. Needless to say, the war situation will not end in the short term, and it is not even possible to safely withdraw the current troops in China.</p>
<p>Because the war against China has reached a dead end, Japan has no choice but to change its political and military strategy from defending the south and attacking the north to defending the north and attacking the south, from being pro-British and anti-Soviet to being anti-British, anti-French, and anti-Soviet at the same time. In other words, it is shifting from a continental offensive to a dual approach involving both the continent and the sea. Before this new policy was decided, it underwent several probes. The landing in Xiamen in May of last year and the occupation of Guangzhou in October were both aimed at testing the reactions of Great Britain and France. The result was the opposite of Zhanggufeng; Great Britain and France softened their attitudes, and the probes were completely successful. Then, on November 3 of last year, Konoe announced the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," and the navy successively concentrated in South China. Recently, the landing on Hainan Island has been a factual proof that the policy of advancing southward has become active.</p>
<p>After landing on Hainan Island, Japan immediately proceeded to establish naval and air bases on Qiongyai Island (Hainan Island) and sent experts from Japan to inspect Hainan, proving that Japan intends to occupy it permanently. At the same time, Japan used its air force to bomb British territory in Kowloon and the New Territories. It also exerted threats on the Shanghai Municipal Council. Japanese Naval Minister Yonai announced that in addition to continuing the shipbuilding plan of 800 million yen that began the year before, he would request an additional naval shipbuilding budget from the parliament at the end of February to compete with Great Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Closely related to this southern advance policy are the military negotiations that have been secretly conducted between Germany and Japan for several months. It is very clear that Hitler needs Japan to pin down Great Britain and France in the Far East, just as he needs Fascist Italy to hold down Great Britain and France in the Mediterranean. Only in this way can Germany extract a large sum from Great Britain and France, an even greater sum than it extracted in Munich. However, what tricks the two fascist countries of Germany and Japan are playing is currently kept secret. Only the French weekly "Vu" revealed a bit of information on January 25. According to reports, Germany and Japan signed a secret agreement in Tokyo on November 20 of last year, which stipulated: (1) If Japan is drawn into a new war due to the China Incident, Germany will provide full assistance to Japan with its army, navy, and air force. (2) Germany will enjoy the same economic privileges as Japan in Chinese territory. Germany also has the right to send technical and military advisors to the "New China" government. (3) If Sakhalin Island and the Soviet Far East territory are placed under Japanese jurisdiction, Germany should be granted transfer rights. (4) Germany may restore its pre-war colonies in the Pacific, provided that it does not harm Japan's strategic security. This is the first part of the secret agreement. The second part stipulates the division of the Malay colonies. Germany would occupy Dutch New Guinea, Madura Island (Mndera) west, the southern part of Celebes, Dutch West Indies Surinam, and British Borneo. However, the British Malay Peninsula up to Singapore, Siam, the rest of the Dutch East Indies, and Burma would be in Japan's sphere of influence. The secret agreement did not mention the division of the Philippines, Hawaii, Vietnam, India, and Burma, supposedly because they were being reserved for when Italy joined the German-Japanese secret agreement, so that they could be newly allocated.</p>
<p>Although this is an unconfirmed report, the fact that Foreign Minister Arita has repeatedly advocated strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact in the 74th session of the Diet, the fact that Germany is preparing to make a new threat to Great Britain and France in March regarding colonies, and the fact that Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands are actively expanding their military power in the Far East all suggest that this news of Germany and Japan dividing up the Pacific colonies is not entirely groundless.</p>
<p>Naturally, these provocative acts by the fascist countries are mostly motivated by intimidation at the moment, because Germany is absolutely unwilling to easily launch a war before it is confident of victory. Japan's main aim at present is still to conquer China, and it has no intention of immediately attacking Great Britain and the United States. However, when one is confronted by a robber with a loaded pistol, who can guarantee that danger will not arise? Today it is intimidation, tomorrow it may be war. In short, the raging waves in the Pacific have already been stirred up.</p>
<p>These raging waves that have already been stirred up cannot be calmed down by any human power. Although some people are still fantasizing about using international conferences to restore peace in the Far East, this is even harder than a black dog turning into a white dog. First, the Pacific problem is now linked to the European problem. If the European problem cannot be resolved, there is naturally even less hope for the Pacific problem. Second, Great Britain and the United States have reached the final limit in their concessions to the aggressor nations. If the British Empire is unwilling to collapse immediately and the United States still wants to maintain its investments and trade markets in the Far East, it is impossible to make further concessions to the aggressor nations. Third, the fascist countries are eagerly trying to seize hegemony in the Pacific. They can use both hard bargaining and soft deception, but they will never easily let go. Fourth, China, the most important country in the Far East, has embarked on the path of independence, liberation, and revival in the War of Resistance. With the principle of "either them or us," there is no room for compromise between us. The China problem cannot be solved until the final victory of the War of Resistance. The entire Pacific problem is naturally even more so.</p>
<p>Naturally, if all the peaceful countries in the Pacific unite and impose military, economic, and moral sanctions on the aggressor nations, there may still be a glimmer of hope for saving peace in the Far East. However, such sanctions are unlikely to be implemented before a major war breaks out in the Pacific. The rulers of the Pacific nations are now thinking about how to launch or how to cope with the future Pacific War, rather than how to promote collective security and peace in the Pacific.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, who have joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, are planning to divide up the colonies of the white countries in the Pacific. Among them, Japan is naturally the vanguard of the Far Eastern aggression forces. After the landing on Hainan Island, the greatest threat on the surface is to French Vietnam. However, this is only because of political and strategic needs. Japan is only provoking France, as France is the weakest link in the Far Eastern colonial empires. Vietnam borders China's southwest resistance base. Directly threatening Vietnam is equivalent to tightening the blockade of China and indirectly threatening Great Britain. However, Japan's real purpose of aggression is not French, but British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia. The rubber and oil needed by Japanese industry and its ideal population migration destination are all in Southeast Asia. The iron of the Philippines, the abundant mineral resources and wool of Australia are the main targets of Japan's aggression. Therefore, there are probably three routes for Japan's southern advance: the first is to occupy the Philippines and then advance to New Guinea and Australia; the second is to seize Singapore and Borneo and then encompass the Malay Federation and the Dutch East Indies; and the third is to invade Vietnam from Hainan Island, then annex Burma and India from Vietnam, and place Siam under Japanese protection. However, at the beginning of a future war, Japan must strive for the neutrality of the United States; or temporarily not take the first route, but first take the second and third routes. At that time, taking Hong Kong would be like taking something out of a pocket. Vietnam may be invaded, but the main battle will be in Singapore. If the United States does not participate in the war, Japan will have to overcome the strong resistance of the British-Dutch Allied forces at the very least to achieve its goal.</p>
<p>Here, Japan will rely on the help of Western fascist countries. Although, in addition to air force participation and economic aid, Germany and Italy will not give their Far Eastern accomplices any strong assistance, if the navies and air forces of Germany and Italy in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Red Sea can play a significant role in containing Great Britain and France, then Japan will be more confident of victory. The reason why Japan urgently needs to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact at present lies here.</p>
<p>In addition, the fascist aggressors also plan to use Siam, a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, as an important base for attacking British and French territories. The Siamese government is currently under the influence of Fascism. The Siamese Prime Minister Luang Pibul openly declared his worship of Hitler and Mussolini in a radio speech last year. Recently, the German Defense Force newspaper Deutsche Wehr also said, "If Siam concludes an alliance with Japan, the security of French Vietnam will be completely destroyed." Japan's intelligence agencies have played many tricks in Siam in recent years, and Siam's pro-Japanese stance is very obvious. Therefore, the great power political and diplomatic struggle for this small Eastern country is very important. If Siam becomes the Hungary of Asia, not only will Vietnam not be safe, but Burma and Singapore will also be in danger of being invaded at any time.</p>
<p>Under the southern advance policy of Japan and the encirclement and attack of the fascist group's aggressive conspiracies, the colonies of Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands are already under the blades of strong enemies. What policy will Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands take to ensure the security of their territories in the Pacific?</p>
<p>Although Chamberlain's diplomacy only knows how to make concessions to the aggressors, both in the West and in the East, he has recently begun to realize that peace must be maintained by force. If Great Britain maintains peace by force and does not maintain peace by sacrificing small countries, peace can still be maintained. In order to jointly deal with international murderers, Great Britain will definitely get the cooperation of the United States and the Soviet Union. In particular, China, which is fighting in the War of Resistance, is the greatest pillar of peace in the Far East. The British government must understand this sooner or later: only by using all its strength to support China's War of Resistance and sanctioning Japanese aggression can it preserve its vast colonies in the Far East. Even if it does not understand it at present, facts will teach Chamberlain to understand it. As for France's Far Eastern policy, it is making the same mistake as its Spanish policy: trying to hide from the wind and rain under the broken umbrella of "neutrality," which only benefits the aggressors. Now Vietnam is surrounded on three sides by aggressors. France is actively strengthening its land, sea, and air defenses in the Far East. The Bay of Cam Ranh opposite Hainan Island is being built into a first-class naval port. Undoubtedly, France's Far Eastern policy will be strengthened following Great Britain. As for the Netherlands, it also cannot but rely on Great Britain militarily. The Hague has only recently passed a large-scale shipbuilding plan, which is a bit late, but it is still not too late.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Far Eastern policy is completely correct. In recent months, he has delivered many anti-aggression speeches, established the foundation of the Pan-American anti-aggression front in Lima, and submitted to Congress the Guam fortification plan and the four-year military expansion budget. Roosevelt has seen that the fascist aggressors are the only enemy of the United States. Although the Guam fortification plan has not yet been passed by Congress, this is because the aggressors' swords have not yet touched the United States, so the isolationists controlled by the financial groups still retain some power. However, it can be determined that the United States' Pacific policy will eventually abandon isolationism and adopt a more ambitious anti-aggression line.</p>
<p>Today, as Japan's aggression shifts from advancing northward to advancing southward, the Soviet Union's position in the Far East is becoming stronger day by day. In the raging waves of the Pacific, only the Soviet Union has become the mainstay of peace. This is undeniable. The strength and progress of the Soviet Union is a major factor in determining the collapse of the fascist aggression forces and the final victory of the forces of peace.</p>
<p>But at present, the lever of the Pacific problem is China's War of Resistance. Precisely because China insists on fighting the War of Resistance to the end and relying on its own efforts, all the aggressors' soft deception and hard bargaining will inevitably fail completely. Precisely because China is fighting for democracy and peace, the people of the Pacific will enjoy democracy and peace due to the victory of China's War of Resistance. The Pacific problem was directly caused by Japan's destruction of China's territorial integrity and will inevitably be resolved in a lasting and rational manner only after China defeats Japan and recovers its lost territories.</p>
<h3>A Memorial Meeting of Blood and Tears</h3>
<p>— (Special Dispatch from Dongjiang) Lin Heng</p>
<p>I. Running Up Flying Goose Ridge</p>
<p>Today's sun has been half-covered by dark clouds; however, its remaining power still shines from the east to the southwest, illuminating the West Lake of Huizhou City. The solemn and elegant Huizhou Middle School is beautifully reflected on the surface of the West Lake. Across the lake is a small Chinese-style garden. Plum blossoms have withered, bowing their heads, hinting to the little birds and bees to intensify their activities. In the middle of the garden stand two small Western-style buildings. To the left of the buildings is a red clay road. The leaves beside the road are not newly covered with mud, clearly indicating that the road has not been used by vehicles for a long time.</p>
<p>In the larger of the two Western-style buildings, there is a large hall in the middle. On the front is pasted "Resistance Against Japan Above All Else" written in red ink, with "Work Actively and Study Hard" and "Tense, Serious, Lively, and United" pasted on both sides. The bulletin board has a daily schedule, and opposite it is activity; to the right are the tenets of the new style, and to the left hang many anti-Japanese war songs. "What a solemn work hall!" the reporter said excitedly.</p>
<p>The clock had just struck eleven, and the hall was, as usual, crowded with dozens of young and lively youths. "It's time, let's go!" a child who looked only thirteen years old suggested to the others. "Okay! Let's go immediately!" someone responded to the call. Then, the crowd began to move.</p>
<p>In groups of three or five, some laughing, some jumping, the crowd flowed south along the Huizhou-Zhangzhou Highway. Some were talking and laughing, others climbing onto a 'Ma Liu Zai' [a slang term for a disabled vehicle] that had been destroyed beside the road, pretending to be the driver of a car that couldn't move. At the same time, some were behaving very solemnly, thinking about the revolutionary facts of the 'January 28th' Incident. Looking at the cars overturned into the lake, several ducks swimming freely appeared in the middle of the lake, as if demonstrating to the slaves, or telling the oppressed: "How precious freedom and liberation are!"</p>
<p>The highway separates the West Lake, and the bridge in the middle has been blown up by ××. There are countless bloodstains beside the road, and military caps and torn clothes float on the lake. Walking, walking, and walking again, suddenly Flying Goose Ridge appeared before them. Several pioneering 'little devils' were already singing on the top of the ridge. This group of young people, in a competitive manner, not wanting to be tortoises, ran to the top of the mountain together.</p>
<p>II. In Front of the Bunker</p>
<p>After inspecting the battle achievements of the bunker, the memorial meeting began.</p>
<p>The sky was still unclear as before, and the sun's power was very weak, unable to lift the dark clouds, making the land under the sun entirely gloomy. A gentle breeze blew from the northwest, making people on the land feel cold.</p>
<p>The meeting began with the singing of the party song, and the whole atmosphere became solemn. Then, the chairman announced the significance of the memorial meeting, reporting the historical facts of the 'January 28th' Anti-Japanese War. The audience became excited and tense following the tragedy of the historical facts.</p>
<p>Just as the chairman was giving the most indignant report, everyone suddenly saw He Jun advancing towards the meeting place with heavy steps, step by step. As he walked closer and closer, everyone could clearly see his face. He was too grief-stricken. His face had already silently told the audience that he was sad, troubled, and at the same time indignant. Everyone's eyes were focused on He Jun. The reporter began to doubt his memory, "Didn't He Jun say in front of the National Assembly that he couldn't attend the memorial meeting because he was too busy with work? Why is he rushing here now?" Many people looked at him with strange eyes, knowing that he had received a great shock, and eager for him to speak.</p>
<p>"Comrades," He Jun began to speak knowingly, "I am too excited. I have a lot of work to go back and do. But when I came down the mountain, I saw the entire Huizhou City, surrounded by the East River and the West Lake. Huizhou City is too beautiful, too lovely. The beautiful scenery of mountains and clear waters attracted me to stop." Following his impatient personality, he did not continue to describe the beautiful rivers and mountains. He went on to say what he wanted to say. "Suddenly I recalled the bloodstains and torn clothes I had just seen, the broken badges and tattered military flags of the soldiers in the bunker, the emotions..." When he said this, his vocal cords began to tremble, and the speed of his heartbeat also increased. Everyone else was moved. "Emo...tions... made me turn back... I had to attend today's memorial meeting." Tears had filled He Jun's eyes, and his voice was full of tragic indignation. Yang "Little Devil" began to cry, and most people's eyes were red. "Comrades, the fallen soldiers were too heroic, heroically sacrificing themselves. We must swear to be national warriors: revenge..." After a short pause, He Jun continued, "Comrades, I call on everyone to take another look at the bunker, to enter the bunker... to see the belts and vests left by the soldiers... After seeing them, come out and stand in front of the bunker to pay our respects... a long... long time of respect..." He Jun stopped speaking, and the meeting place fell silent. Li Jun, Wang Jun, and Chen Jun all cried. After a while, Tan Jun was the first to break the silence, "Comrades, we should respond to He Jun's call and go to the bunker together." Everyone quietly turned around and walked away, no one making a sound, only the faint sound of shoes rubbing against the grass.</p>
<p>"Look, this is the soldiers' leftover clothing..." He Jun said, pointing with his "shi de," [likely a misprinted "zhi de" meaning "finger"]. No one answered, and the atmosphere was still deathly silent.</p>
<p>Wu Jun walked alone, suddenly feeling strange, "Where have the comrades gone? Why is there no sound at all?" Regardless, Wu Jun lowered his head and bent his body, stepping into the bunker from the steel entrance. To his surprise, almost everyone who had attended the meeting was crowded here, yet still no one made a sound.</p>
<p>"This is poison antidote!" "This is gunpowder!" After a long time, someone spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Look! This is the soldiers' notebook... pierced by cruel shrapnel, but many words can still be seen..."</p>
<p>"Chapter One – General Dynamics of Secret Communications (The following is recorded without modification to maintain authenticity – Reporter)</p>
<p>"The most active preparation in the struggles between countries is the work of spying on enemy information... On the surface, various terms are used... also musical (the following words were blown off by shrapnel – Reporter)... or botanical names as various substitutions... written with chemical reagents... the reagents must be washed off before they can be... clever ones are hidden in specially made rubber bullets, which can be swallowed into the abdomen in an emergency, and then spat out again after eating a kind of reagent after the matter is over..."</p>
<p>"Japan's spy network has not only controlled all of China but also threatened the whole world... Starlight Alliance, Blood Pledge... Dragon Society are all names of Japanese secret organizations... Japanese foreign espionage work is directly under the control of the Second Section of the Army General Staff, while the Navy is managed by the Navy General Staff..."</p>
<p>After wiping the bunker, everyone walked out. He Jun pointed at the bunker again with his "shi de" and said, "Look, this is a good lesson. You can't put mud on the slope of the fortress. If the mud is shot down by a gun, it will block the muzzle and the machine will not work..."</p>
<p>"Okay! Now let's all stand at attention in front of the bunker and pay our respects!"</p>
<p>"When we pay our respects, we must! ! Think! How heroically the soldiers sacrificed themselves! We must! Think! Think! How to train ourselves to avenge the soldiers!" (The voice trembled) Following Jun-Jun's made such a supplement.</p>
<p>III. Paying Respects – Heroic Anti-Japanese War Soldiers</p>
<p>Pay respects, heroic anti-Japanese war soldiers, the salute begins.</p>
<p>The sky was still unclear as before, and the air was even more silent and gloomy. The shouts of children came from afar, corresponding to the sound of the young people's hot tears hitting the ground and the sound of urgent breathing. The atmosphere became even more tragic. Peng Jun's desire for curiosity was great, so he raised his head and looked into the distance. On another ridge, there were two pine trees moving with the wind, as if nodding to the soldiers in salute. Retracting his gaze, Peng Jun saw that Comrade Dun was crying the most miserably. Everyone was crying, filled with sadness, resentment, and excitement. This scene is difficult to describe; even the world's greatest artist could only describe a fraction of it. Turning his gaze again, Peng Jun saw that Comrade Tan was holding a soldier's steel helmet, his gaze focused inside the helmet, as if trying to find something inside.</p>
<p>Saluting in the silent air, the salute finished in the silent air, He Jun couldn't help but utter a tragic tone:</p>
<p>"...I cried, why did I cry? The bravery of the soldiers moved me. I think my work attitude is not as... brave... as the fallen soldiers... I want to swear to follow in the footsteps of the soldiers, to avenge the nation!" (The voice was loud and strong)</p>
<p>"Dear comrades," Ms. Ruan interjected, "...It is not enough for us to cry... We must make the × people repay their blood debts with blood!... We must intensify our study of all fighting techniques, this is the condition for us to kill the enemy!" Ms. Ruan was almost truly mad, and everyone's angry emotions increased even more!</p>
<p>After a while, everyone was silent. He Jun called on everyone again to inspect the bunker on the opposite mountain. No one responded, but the crowd began to move with He Jun. Suddenly, someone said in a low voice, "I think we should inspect the bunker on the opposite side another day. Today we should continue the meeting." Still no one answered. After a moment of silence, He Jun withdrew the proposal, and everyone sat down, and the memorial meeting continued.</p>
<p>First, Chen reported on the historical events of the "January 28th" Incident, and the lessons learned from the "January 28th". Then, he asked everyone to express their opinions and feelings to enrich the content of the meeting.</p>
<p>It was extremely strange, and there was another silence. The first to break the silent atmosphere were still two young comrades, followed by Comrade Dun standing up, "I felt very uncomfortable today with a headache, but after arriving at the bunker, it was completely better... I... my heart beat and I shed tears... but I will use this angry mood to swear to drive away the Japanese devils, and use a big laugh to repay today's suffering." Following Lai Jun was Li Qingying's speech, and then Li Jiezhen's speech...</p>
<p>Holding a steel helmet, Tan Jun stood up, and said very solemnly, "I have never been so moved in my life as I am today. My heart is beating, beating so much that it can't beat anymore. If it beats anymore, it will suffocate... We must cherish this steel helmet. There are soldiers' bloodstains on it." Pointing to the helmet, Tan Jun suddenly showed a painful expression, and he continued his speech with a trembling voice. "We must add our blood to the helmet and fight together with the blood inside to win the victory of national liberation... We must use our greatest efforts to strike at those traitors Wang Jingwei and all the Chinese traitors who have not yet accepted the lesson of blood in order to repay the dead soldiers... What I said only expresses one percent of what I wanted to say." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Chongqing's "Gu Gu Yuan"</h3>
<p>— Know Me</p>
<p>The Historical Facts of "Chef Old Master"</p>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday's Chongqing Airmail)</p>
<p>Old Master's law, no matter who it is, when dining at Gu Gu Yuan, their status cannot be higher than his, nor can they look down on him, especially not treating him as an ordinary chef. "Bachelor as tall as a pagoda", "Official with high position", before taking a seat, you must greet the Old Master, at least saying: "Old Master, have a drink, this seat is reserved for you!" Old Master usually replies: "No, I'm still busy! You eat first!" Having done this, the Old Master stands aside. Every time a dish comes, he must call the guest by name, without any honorifics like Mr., Master, Ms., or Madam, just like the "Old Master" instructing his children. He asks you, "Do you understand this dish? Do you know how to make it? Do you like it?" At this time, you must also stand up and answer: "Yes, Old Master, we like it very much, but we don't know how to cook it?" When the Old Master hears your answer, he will, as usual, instruct the younger generation like an elder, explaining it in detail. You eat, listen, and praise endlessly, indicating that you truly understand how the dish is made, having eaten it for the first time. If this is the case, the Old Master is happy, and you are also considered a close guest. Otherwise, the Old Master will not be pleased with you, and you will naturally be refused next time, no matter how troublesome this early preparation is, curious people, those who like to try new things, still flock to it, trying every possible way to get a meal.</p>
<p>The cost of the ingredients is usually paid in advance. You cannot complain about the combination of the dishes. If the bill is 100, you cannot give 99. If you are hosting guests today, you must go to discuss with "Old Master" three or four days in advance. If "Old Master" says he doesn't have time, that means he refuses. You must "not open your mouth". If you are good at rhetoric, when you meet the Old Master on the road, greet him with a smiling face from afar, bowing deeply, and ask, "Old Master, do you have time? Please help me, I plan to entertain some distinguished guests at your place." When the Old Master hears that you want to entertain distinguished guests, he will definitely stop and ask the names of the guests you are inviting. If he thinks it's okay, he will say: "Okay, you come tomorrow!"</p>
<p>In addition to "eating", you must appreciate the "Yellow Court Scripture" written by the Old Master and the calligraphy and paintings hanging all over the walls at "Gu Gu Yuan". When appreciating, making a "tsk tsk" sound of praise is very appropriate, otherwise, the Old Master will consider you "vulgar".</p>
<p>Sometimes the "Chef Old Master" is also invited to cook at your home, which depends on your status and position. If he agrees to your invitation, the procedure is like this: the host must prepare an invitation card, "Please Old Master to honor us with your presence at a certain place on a certain day to enjoy a simple meal." The words "honor us with your presence" are indispensable, because when the Old Master goes, he is accompanied by the master's concubine, eldest daughter, nanny, servants, and so on. Inviting only the "Old Master" without mentioning the whole family is considered disrespectful and insincere by the Old Master. It is said that the name "Gu Gu Yuan" of the "Old Master" is because, in addition to the "Old Master", the concubine, eldest daughter, nanny, and servants also have to help with cooking. "The Old Master" is respected, "when one attains the Dao, even one's chickens and dogs ascend to heaven". Following this definition, the concubine and eldest daughter may as well call themselves "Gu Gu" (aunt). People who eat there cannot pick on this word, if they don't consider them "Gu Gu", they have to force themselves to consider them "Gu Gu". For the sake of eating famous dishes, they have to become one generation younger. There is a special event: when "Old Master" leads his whole family to your mansion, they must be picked up and dropped off by car. Without a car, even if everything else is prepared, they will not go.</p>
<p>How is the food cooked? Some people criticize it as "light and refreshing", some criticize it as "incomprehensible", and some criticize it as "nothing special". Anyway, God knows that it is cooked by "Chef Old Master", the taste is hard to say, but the Old Master, a "Magistrate Old Master", is willing to cook in the kitchen, this alone makes many people think it is worth eating as an honor. Someone once asked indiscreetly, "Old Master, why is your food so expensive?" It is said that "Old Master" is most unhappy with this sentence. His answer is only "Cooking is a pastime, the ingredients are different from the public, and must be prepared two or three days in advance. For a table of dishes, at least five or six chickens have to be slaughtered. Just the chicken soup alone has to be cooked for two days, let alone anything else."</p>
<p>When the national government moved to Chongqing, many government officials were fascinated by the "Old Master's" great name, sparing no expense to have a feast at "Gu Gu Yuan". The "Old Master" raised his status, accepting only one table a day, no more. Therefore, it often took a long time to ask someone to introduce you, and you couldn't get a seat. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Chongqing a few years ago, he heard of this trend and personally instructed the ministers of the various departments not to have such extravagant acts of eating at "Gu Gu Yuan" again. Several minor characters were even punished for eating a meal there. But no matter how much Chairman Chiang Kai-shek forbade it, some people still secretly went to eat, and the "Chef Old Master's" status did not decrease in the slightest.</p>
<p>On January 15, × planes came to bomb Chongqing. The "Old Master" was unable to suppress his fear. After being frightened once, his heart paralysis recurred. He only lay in bed for two days and died, and the "Gu Gu Yuan" that was on everyone's lips also closed down.</p>
<p>In Chengdu, there is a younger brother of the "Chef Old Master" who opened a "Gu Nu Cai" (Ancient Woman's Cuisine) tavern. There is also a second young master of the "Old Master" who opened a "Bu Zui Wu Gui" (Not Drunk, No Return) small restaurant. These are all inherited from the "Chef Old Master's" legacy, and are calling for the special elegant Sichuan cuisine of "Gu Gu Yuan". But in the end, they are not as magnificent and imposing as the Old Master's style. (24th, Chongqing)</p>

<p>Domestic and Foreign Support Efforts, Government Officials Eagerly Donate, Overseas Chinese Raise Funds to Purchase Vehicles 【Associated Press, Chongqing, 4th】 The donation campaign led by the New Life Movement General Association here has been ongoing for five days. Yesterday, the Bankers Association donated 600,000 yuan. The association celebrated with firecrackers.

The medal, inscribed with "Resist to the End," was purchased by the Bankers Association for 10,000 yuan. Kong Xiangxi and Sun Ke each donated 10,000 yuan, and Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui donated 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Local News] Since the start of our full-scale war of resistance, overseas Chinese, in addition to enthusiastically donating and assisting the government in the war effort, are also striving to raise funds to purchase medicine for use by the soldiers at the front. According to a reporter, the Chinese community in New York, America, recently took advantage of the New Year to raise 400,000 US dollars to purchase one hundred of the latest ambulances for use by the soldiers at the front. These vehicles will be shipped back to the country in succession and transferred to the front lines.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] Zhang Zhenfan, President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Nam Dinh, Vietnam, remitted a check to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on February 28th through the East Asia Bank, along with a national salvation donation of 50,000 yuan. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek replied, "The Chamber of Commerce generously donated to jointly overcome national difficulties, demonstrating a warm love for the country, which is deeply gratifying. The message should be conveyed immediately for commendation to encourage others." The Military Affairs Commission has sent a letter to President Zhang and transferred the funds to the relevant authorities for receipt.</p>

<p>After the Enemy Infiltration of Hainan Island, Vietnam Strengthens Military Preparations. Ordnance Factories and Aircraft Factories Begin Construction. Indigenous Troop Numbers Double. The French Colonial Minister Reports to the Assembly. [Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] Colonial Minister Moutet recently attended the Colonial Committee of the Senate this afternoon and presented a detailed report on the situation caused by the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. He stated that Vietnam's air power has been strengthened, and ordnance factories and aircraft factories have begun construction (currently manufacturing 150 military aircraft and 400 engines per year). In short, Vietnam already enjoys autonomous rights in its military organization. The number of indigenous troops in other colonies has doubled compared to a year ago, and will continue to be increased in the future. He compared the troop levels of the French-owned Somaliland in East Africa and Italian-owned East Africa, and concluded that the French colonies are under alert and prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] Oudet, a former member of the Chamber of Deputies in Nam Dinh, Vietnam, gave a speech this afternoon at the executive committee of the Maritime Colonial Association, stating that the Japanese occupation of Hainan has threatened France.

<p>The Enemy Attempts to Seize Administrative Power in the Shanghai Concessions. Using the Pretext of Suppressing Terrorist Activities to Force the Signing of Agreements and Compel "Cooperation". [Reuters, Shanghai, 4th] A Japanese military spokesman here told reporters today that senior Japanese army and navy officers visited the commanders of the British, American, and Italian forces stationed in Shanghai today to request cooperation. They requested that the foreign military commanders agree to jointly eliminate terrorist activities in the Public Concession, in accordance with the steps agreed upon yesterday by the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council. The spokesman said in response to a question that there was no so-called cooperation problem in the past, but that future cooperation will be closer after discussions with the foreign military authorities.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 4th] Regarding the Japanese side's repeated protests about the Shanghai concession's suppression of terrorist activities, the Public Concession's Municipal Council reached an agreement with the Japanese military authorities yesterday. According to a public announcement issued by the Japanese Consulate General, the main points of its content include: (1) Strictly implementing the emergency decrees issued by the Municipal Council; (2) Handing over armed terrorists to the relevant parties; (3) Cooperation between concession police and Japanese military and consular police; (4) Protecting Japanese residents and prohibiting everything. The agreement also contains measures to prevent disruptive elements from entering the concession, searching Chinese people entering and leaving the concession at certain key points, and increasing the number of Japanese police in the Municipal Council. The announcement stated that the most important point is the cooperation between officials of various countries and the residents of the colony.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Reports at the Political Council on Developing the Rich Resources of the West (Continued) --- Part Five of the March Political Report ---</p>
<p>Third, even before the war of resistance, the people of the country had already attached importance to the promotion and relief of the rural economy. Therefore, at that time, in addition to rural cooperation and agricultural experiments, the government specially established the Agricultural Bank to specifically regulate rural finance. This kind of work must be done even if there is no war of resistance, and it must be done even more during the war of resistance. However, before the war of resistance, the work of the Agricultural Bank focused on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Since the war of resistance, it has changed to focusing on the southwestern provinces. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Agricultural Bank established 76 county cooperative treasuries in the southwestern provinces, recognizing a share capital of more than 7 million yuan, and established 49 agricultural warehouses, which can accommodate more than 1 million dan of grain. It invested a total of 8.7 million yuan in farmland irrigation, which can irrigate more than 2.3 million mu of paddy fields. It purchased cotton yarn, cloth, and food and transported it to the rear to meet the urgent needs of the military and civilians, worth more than 11 million yuan. Although the business of the Agricultural Bank has reached a considerable scale, we still need to continue to work hard and expand it. However, rural work is extremely difficult. Not only is the level of knowledge of farmers very low, but there are no financial institutions in the countryside that can be used. Therefore, the speed of rural undertakings cannot be as great as that of cities.</p>
<p>Two Major Advances in Transportation As for transportation, there have been two major advances in the past three months. First, in the past, there were several agencies managing transportation, and cooperation was quite difficult, and waste was unavoidable. In order to correct this malpractice, the Executive Yuan specially established a Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee at the beginning of this year, in order to centralize transportation tools and rationalize the transportation of goods. After the success of British and American loans, we can probably double the number of vehicles on our highways. Second, we have determined the railway network in the southwest. In addition to the Yunnan-Burma Railway, we plan to build the Kunming-Yibin Road, and then connect Weining on the Kunming-Yibin Line to Guiyang, and from Guiyang to Liuzhou. In this way, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi can all be integrated. The railway in the northwest is currently being actively negotiated with friendly countries, and there are no concrete results that can be reported. In addition, the air link between China and Britain also deserves our attention. According to the agreement, our planes can fly to Rangoon, and British planes can fly from Rangoon to Kunming. Once we get to Rangoon, we are on the main road for flights between Europe and Asia. In the future, mail and passengers between Europe and Asia can be much faster. There will be detailed reports on military and political affairs. There will also be opportunities in the future to report to you in detail on financial work. In order to save time today, I will not mention them.</p>
<p>Belief in Inevitable Victory in the War of Resistance Due to the above-mentioned manifestations of various facts, it can be seen that my country's wartime organization has reached perfection. In terms of human, financial, and material resources, total mobilization has long been implemented. Compared with the Japanese, who daily chant national total mobilization but actually have constant disputes, it is even more effective. This is all because the various competent authorities, under the leadership of the Supreme Commander, can plan and proceed in response to environmental needs, and can concentrate their efforts to engage in the work of resistance. External warfare is a touchstone of a nation. The shortcomings revealed by our nation this time are, generally speaking, nothing more than that our degree of modernization is not enough. The enemy chose to attack us at the beginning of our country's modernization, believing that our strength was not enough to resist their aggression and that they would be able to achieve a quick victory. But their estimate was wrong. The Chinese nation, in the midst of hardship and difficulty, has shown the great spirit that has been cultivated for thousands of years. Therefore, we believe that the future of the nation is bright. The war of resistance has increased our self-confidence. We should reform quickly when we find shortcomings in our work. At the same time, we should not only preserve the advantages shown by the nation, but also carry them forward. When the Political Council meets, it is time for us to review the past and plan for the future. The government is willing to discuss national affairs with you with full sincerity. Whether things are related to the current war of resistance or to the grand plan of building the country for a hundred years, we should all plan carefully and work together for complete success. You are all well-known celebrities and scholars in the country, and your knowledge is extremely rich. We hope that you will express your opinions and contribute to the country. We are full of expectations. (End)</p>

<p>Panic Over Fuel, Civilians Cannot Light Fires 【Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd】 At the end of February this year, the weather in Tokyo was cold, and coal and charcoal were in short supply. Coal merchants said that although the price of coal has tripled compared to the previous two seasons, it is still impossible to obtain coal for household needs. Many families in Tokyo have had to stop their habit of bathing every night or switch to cold water baths. Even the coal for cooking is in short supply. Charcoal merchants here ran out of charcoal at the beginning of this year. Retailers in Tokyo, Yokohama, and other places are in great distress because they have no coal to sell.</p>
<p>Implementing the National Mobilization Law to Restrict Daily Consumption 【Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd】 From July 1st this year, the Japanese government plans to mobilize all retail merchants in the country and conduct a national commodity survey to show the total sales volume and value over the past year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] Seven hundred tennis clubs in Japan have had to reduce the schedule of tennis matches for the next season to a minimum due to the Japanese government's restrictions on the consumption of rubber for sports.

Therefore, the number of rubber balls used nationwide this year is limited to 778 dozen.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] In order to save necessary metals for the war against China, it has been decided to issue millions of lead auxiliary coins and withdraw the currently circulating copper-nickel auxiliary coins.</p>
<p>At the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Enemy Warlords Groan and Lament 【Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th】 Japanese Army Minister Itagaki pointed out at the meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives the necessity of reserving military materials, saying, "As a result of Japan's military operations in China, it is necessary to consume military materials and goods in order to force the Kuomintang army to abandon its anti-Japanese resistance and to maintain peace and security in the occupied areas. The special budget for the army for the next year to deal with the war in China will be roughly the same as this year's. Only a part of the troops in China must be transferred back and replaced by new troops. At the same time, another sum of money must be allocated for the construction of military defense works." Navy Minister Yonai said, "The navy's special budget of 81.2 million yen will supply the activities of the naval forces in China, including warships, aircraft, military supplies, and the construction of defensive structures and the establishment of hospitals." During the War of Resistance, the Chinese Press Strives to Produce "Paper Bullets" in the Enemy's Rear Area; A Vigorous Atmosphere Despite Hardships 【Associated Press, Chongqing, 4th】 Local Chinese newspapers said that 58 Chinese newspapers have been closed in the occupied areas of Beiping, 15 in Qingdao, 18 in Nanjing, 27 in Tianjin, and 21 in Guangzhou. There are now a total of 117 newspapers published in the rear area of China, including 19 in Chongqing and 1 each in Xinjiang and Qinghai. Newspapers that have moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong include Shen Bao, Lih Pao, and Ta Kung Pao. There are a total of 20 Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong. Chinese newspapers unanimously use the slogan "The enemy's rear is our front line" and strive to produce "paper bullets." The Shanxi Chinese Army and the Eighth Route Army publish 45 kinds of newspapers. Guerrilla teams also run some newspapers in the occupied areas to supply spiritual food.</p>
<p>The Urgent Need to Excise the Carbuncle of Western Hunan - Special Correspondent Keng Ya</p>
<p>The serious problems that are fully displayed in western Hunan today, based on the reasons mentioned in the previous dispatch, are not only due to how the enemy threatens, but also to several internal problems that are growing secretly; they are described as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Refugee Problem. I remember Mr. Xu Shiying calling refugees righteous people, truly because their aspirations and actions are commendable. Currently, the refugees gathered in western Hunan are mostly people from the Jiangzhe and Jinghu areas, and the families of small civil servants from various institutions. They painfully feel the fall of their homelands, are unwilling to submit, and first fled to Wuhan, where they could barely make a living for a limited time. The second step was to flee to western Hunan. The travel expenses they brought with them were like "dead water that cannot be stirred by a gourd," and they fell into difficult straits. They pawned clothes, sold antiques, borrowed from relatives and friends, and telegraphed for remittances (the telegraph office sends the most telegrams every day with urgent requests for money, such as "urgent need for money" and "hoping for money as hoping for life"). All avenues of hope have been exhausted, and their lives of wandering and displacement due to national disasters have since fallen into an unimaginably bitter sea!</p>
<p>2. The Wounded Soldier Problem can be divided into two parts: one part consists of wounded soldiers who have just been transferred from the front line. Because they have suffered from artillery fire on the front line, and the transportation on this route is inconvenient, they often have to walk with their injuries. A few, believing that they have made great contributions and should enjoy special treatment in the rear, are inevitably disappointed by their experiences along the way. In addition, the inadequate hospital facilities can further arouse their anger, and even the slightest dissatisfaction can cause unnecessary conflicts. Another part consists of those who have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, and who have reorganized into honorary regiments and still bravely stepped onto the front line; but there are also those who have deserted and become scattered soldiers, or have become disabled and are unwilling to be transferred further to Sichuan and Guizhou (wounded soldiers who are discharged from the hospital and are found to be disabled in various grades should be concentrated in designated disability hospitals in the rear). Although the number is small each time, if they accumulate several times, they can become a mountain, becoming an underwater reef in the quiet stream of society. This phenomenon is inevitable in places where wounded soldiers are received and concentrated, but western Hunan, due to its special location and transportation, seems to experience it more severely. For example, Changde was originally an important town in western Hunan and is also one of the ends of the confluence of wounded soldiers and refugees from various places. Although it is known as a rice-producing region, its excessive population increase has affected the procurement of food and salt, and it is gradually feeling the frustration of still water not quenching immediate thirst.</p>
<p>3. The Bandit Problem is the core problem of security in western Hunan. There have been many bandits in western Hunan for a long time. In the past, poor politics, lack of public awareness, inconvenient transportation, and the suffering of the people's livelihood have combined to create the phenomenon of today. It is said that the bandits spreading in the mountainous areas of western Hunan and the border between Hunan and Guizhou number no fewer than several gangs, with hundreds of people in each group. However, "there is also a way for thieves." They do not rob soldiers who are going to the front line to resist the war, wandering young students, refugees, or mail. However, wealthy merchants and, around the time of the withdrawal from Wuhan, the vehicles carrying valuables belonging to many senior civil servants who were driving from western Hunan to Sichuan and Yunnan were invariably "borrowed" by them. General Xue Yue was appointed to preside over the political affairs of Hunan in early February, and the first chapter of his manifesto was to strictly order the security zones to eliminate bandits within a time limit, which is indeed a crucial and timely measure.</p>
<p>The above three major problems in western Hunan: how should refugees be actively organized and trained? How should wounded soldiers be properly managed? Responsible agencies and social figures have discussed them extensively. If the government is determined to solve them, it is not difficult to achieve success. As for the bandit problem, it is certainly very serious. However, in the current era of the sacred war of resistance and rapid progress, it is possible to take advantage of the situation and completely resolve it. We know that bandits are not unchangeable people, and they are not completely unusable people. In a certain sense, they are certainly bad, but in another sense, they are also suitable for use in a national war. In the past and present, many of the most active guerrilla teams in the areas between the White Mountains and Black Waters outside the pass, the land of generous songs in Yan and Zhao, and the Taihu Lake basin in the north and south of the Yangtze River are incarnations of these heroes of the green forest, bravely participating in battles to establish extraordinary meritorious service. To go further, Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past used various secret societies as revolutionary forces, and the sage of Hunan, Zuo Zongtang, used secret societies to quell Xinjiang. Wasn't his approach to find a way to transform the existing potential undercurrent in society into a useful mainstream in the great era?</p>
<p>In the past, the local government had partially adopted the method of appeasing the bandits in western Hunan, but neglected political education work. As a result, not only did it fail to subtly change their nature, but it also allowed them to secretly engage in illegal activities under a protective talisman. The method of prescribing the right medicine for the future is good, as they already have the good intention of "not robbing soldiers resisting the war." We should urgently use political means to focus on this valuable motive, and use it to persuade, appease, and recruit them, expanding their motive of "not robbing soldiers resisting the war" to not robbing the entire people and the entire country, and further adopt a positive attitude to jointly participate in actual resistance actions. I think that we are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and they have many brave men. As long as the measures of appeasement are appropriate, the problem is indeed not difficult to solve.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a more practical and fundamental method. This is a specific suggestion from a certain gentleman from Hunan: "Find ways to dredge river channels, regulate the supply and demand of food (food prices vary in each county. For example, the selling price of top-quality white rice in Changde is 12 or 13 yuan per picul, while it is only worth 4 or 5 yuan in Yuanling, 300 or 400 miles upstream, and further upstream it drops to 2 or 3 yuan. On the one hand, low prices hurt farmers, and on the other hand, rice shortages are gradually felt, all due to inconvenient transportation and inability to regulate). Give the people the greatest democracy and freedom, and universally mobilize the people to organize; more importantly, strengthen political work, especially the political work of the self-defense regiments, which is even more urgent!" It can be seen that the key to solving the problem is that all factions return to their origins and still mobilize politically. I believe that the government should make the greatest determination to do so!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] According to official announcement tonight, the current Ambassador to Iraq, Sir Peterson, has been appointed as Ambassador to the Spanish Franco government.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 4th] The British government has decided to appoint Sir Peterson as Ambassador to the Spanish Franco government. It is noted that Sir Peterson enjoyed a reputation for diplomatic genius from a young age. He is currently fifty years old and only entered the diplomatic world in 1921, serving as private secretary to Earl Balfour and participating in the Washington Conference. Afterwards, he served as a counselor in the embassies in Washington, Sofia, Prague, Tokyo, and Madrid. He made meritorious contributions during the Laval-Hoare Pact. Sir Peterson understands the domestic situation in Spain. When King Alfonso XIII of Spain abdicated in 1931, he served as the chief counselor in the British Embassy in Madrid.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] Well-informed sources here have recently announced that the French government will send a trade delegation within this month, led by the Director of the Economic Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alphand, to Burgos to hold talks with the authorities of the National Government in order to promote trade relations between the two sides.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The French government drafted a bill today requesting an appropriation of 150 million francs to aid refugees from Spain. The bill also requests the ratification of the orders drafted on August 8th and 12th regarding the use of 3.1 million francs. It is generally estimated that this amount will be used until the 15th of this month. In the past three years, France has spent 27.4 million francs on aid to refugees.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 4th] According to the verdict issued yesterday by the Ceret Court, the silver bars transported to France last month by the fifteen trucks of the Spanish Republican government must be temporarily retained in France. The batch of silver bars is worth approximately 20 million francs. The Spanish Franco government requested to take it back, and pointed out that the Republican government had no right to transport it to France. However, the Spanish Republican authorities said that the silver bars belonged to private individuals. In response to their request, they decided to deposit them abroad. It is heard that the French court's opinion is that the batch of silver bars must remain in France as long as the Spanish Republican government exists, pending legal resolution.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Madrid, 3rd) Officials recently announced that the President of the Madrid High Court will begin an investigation into the treatment of political prisoners and prisoners of war transferred from Catalonia to France. The Republican government sent a document to the newspapers expressing regret for the illegal abuse of these prisoners at times, and said that it would begin an investigation and punish those who violated orders soon.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] According to the Burgos special interview of the "Daily Telegraph", British trade representatives are expected to arrive in Spain in the near future to begin economic and financial negotiations with the Franco government. The British side believes that Spain is a large market for British cotton weaving machines, railway wheels, locomotives, motorcycles, raw materials, and all manufactured products. The greatest wish of the British representatives this time is to make the Franco government change its current import and export trade control methods to a more moderate policy.</p>
<p>On the Eve of a New Crisis, Goering Visits Italy, Italy Expresses Extreme Welcome, The World Pays Close Attention [Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd] Air Force Chief of Staff and Four-Year Economic Plan Dictator General Goering, along with his wife, went to the southern coast of Italy this afternoon for vacation. It is rumored that this trip will take the opportunity to hold talks with the Italian government authorities on air defense issues.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 4th] Since the news of General Goering's visit to Italy spread, Italy has been extremely interested, and most newspaper commentaries said that General Goering is the most appropriate person to convey Hitler's thoughts. It has been two years since Goering visited Italy. During these two years, Goering has held the positions of Minister of the Air Force and member of the Four-Year Plan, with heavy responsibilities and many affairs. This tour of Shengli is just right for a little rest. According to the press, Goering may take the opportunity to meet with important political figures, but the external report that Goering will go to Libya is only reprinted without any comment.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom Orders New Aircraft [Reuters, London, 3rd] It is learned that the British Air Force Department recently ordered two "Fairey" high-speed aircraft and has now continued to order twelve of these aircraft. These aircraft are single-leaf aircraft made of Shen metal, equipped with four engines of 10,000 horsepower. At an altitude of 10,000 feet, the speed is 220 miles per hour. It can carry 30 passengers and fly directly to the capital of any European country without stopping. The passenger seat equipment is excellent, allowing passengers to travel comfortably at high altitudes. The higher the aircraft flies, the faster it can go, because the impact of adverse weather conditions at high altitudes is lower.</p>
<p>It is Rumored that Schacht Will Resume an Important Position, Promoting the "Schacht Plan" [Reuters, Berlin, 4th] It is rumored that former German National Bank President Schacht will take a new position and plans to visit Romania. However, people close to Schacht unanimously deny this. External rumors say that Schacht will take an important position in the near future. Some people even think that the reason for Schacht's return is that the Deputy President of the German National Bank, Dr. Bremen, is in poor health and suffering from mental deterioration. According to reports, Dr. Schacht has recently conducted important economic negotiations with major industrialists and exporters, and plans to travel overseas soon. Special attention is paid to the Balkans, including Romania, where he will conclude negotiations that have already begun regarding the purchase of large quantities of oil. There is a new "Schacht Plan" in the industry, which is intended to supplement the four-year plan. Its main task is to reorganize import and export trade and its regulations. Outsiders also say that Schacht will serve as Hitler's economic advisor, and his position is similar to that of Neurath's foreign affairs advisor.</p>
<p>Political Unrest in Czechoslovakia After Submission The Negotiations between the Slovakian State and the Government Have Reached a Stalemate. [Central News Agency, Czech Republic, 4th] Political unrest has occurred in the Czech Republic again. The Slovakian State previously submitted several requests to the Federal Government. The Federal authorities insisted that the authorities of the State should first explain how they would cooperate with the Federal Government before they would agree to consider them. The Slovakian representatives avoided talking about this matter, and the negotiations therefore reached a stalemate. The Czech political unrest this time may also affect the future domestic political situation.</p>
<p>The New Pope Delivers a Peace Speech, Praying for the World to Reach Prosperity; The Papal Secretary of State Has Been Appointed.

<p>[Reuters, Vatican, 3rd] The new Pope Pius XII delivered a peace speech, saying, "This peace is what the Pope advises you and enthusiastically prays for, and is dedicated to it. This peace is the highest gift from heaven and is longed for by kind and righteous people. I hope that everyone will be loved by God and obtain inner peace, bathe in the Holy Spirit of Jesus, and obtain family peace, and hope that all countries will maintain mutual friendship and cooperate together, so as to obtain noble benefits under God's care. At this difficult time, I pray that God will bless the leaders of all countries, so that they can lead their people into a path of prosperity and progress, and I also pray for all welfare for people outside the Church."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Charles Church, 2nd] President Roosevelt sent a telegram to the new Pope today, saying, "I am very pleased to hear of your election as Pope. Your recent visit to the United States, during which I heard your teachings, is still vivid in my memory. Please accept my sincere congratulations."</p>
<p>Religious Disputes Continue Unabated in India. Gandhi Fasting to Advise, Demanding Improved Treatment of the People. The Indian Council of State Requests British Mediation. [Central News Agency, Ragot, 4th] Indian independence movement leader Gandhi fasted for the fourth time yesterday to ask Buddhists to cease their disputes. Gandhi is currently lying in bed, and only a few of Gandhi's most trusted comrades are taking care of him in the room. According to doctors, Gandhi's body is extremely weak.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Mumbai, 4th] The Indian Council of State has sent a telegram to the Governor-General of India requesting him to mediate the conflict between Buddhists and Muslims so that Gandhi can resume eating as soon as possible. The Council of State also decided to adjourn for three days.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] Although the news of Gandhi's hunger strike has attracted great attention from people here, everyone now believes that this is a dispute between Gandhi and the Chief of Rajkot, and no higher authority can intervene. Political figures believe that the Chief's tour of Raputdena will not be suspended due to Gandhi's hunger strike.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ragot, 3rd] Gandhi is on a hunger strike in a simple room on a small bed. Only his most trusted people are allowed to enter. Gandhi's sister, who is 75 years old, entered the room and had an hour-long conversation with Gandhi. The scene was very moving. Gandhi said that unless his proposed reform of Rajkot is fully answered, he will fast to death.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Ragot, 4th] Gandhi began his hunger strike yesterday at noon after a special prayer. Gandhi's body was originally very weak and not suitable for this move. Gandhi's hunger strike this time was because he had presented it to the Chief of Rajkot last week, requesting that the people be granted more rights. The Chief did not answer. An Associated Press reporter witnessed the Chief of Ragot still at ease yesterday, apparently indifferent to Gandhi's hunger strike. According to the Chief, he plans to send a letter to Gandhi, asking him for time to consider.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 3rd] The conflict between Hindus and Muslims has eased, but six injured people have died. Since January 27th, the total number of casualties has been 213, including 14 deaths.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rangoon, 4th] Muslims and Buddhists clashed again yesterday, with 12 people killed and 200 injured. Fortunately, the British army patrolled the affected areas continuously, and the incident could not be expanded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Danzig, 3rd] Five hundred Jewish colonists left here today, and their destination is unknown. This is the first batch of Jews to leave here for other places. They boarded cars with their families this morning, and each person was only allowed to carry a canvas bag. They were inspected by customs in advance. The police also received information that someone was planning to smuggle currency, so they arrested many people, including a Reuters reporter, but released them after a few hours.</p>
<p>Palestine Conference, The British Government Issues Important Documents, The Arabs and Jews Still Hold Their Own Views [Reuters, London, 3rd] The "MacMahon Documents" were issued today by the British government in the form of a white paper. The documents are the correspondence between Sir Henry MacMahon, Governor of Egypt, and Sherif Hussein of Mecca in 1916. The Arab representatives currently use them as the basis for demanding independence. The entire set of letters occupies 16 pages and includes a map of Syria and Turkey. The first letter is from Sherif Hussein to Sir MacMahon, dated July 14, 1915. The letter requests that the British side recognize the independence of the Arab countries. Sir MacMahon's reply, dated August 30, 1915, states that the time is not yet ripe. These documents prove that the British government did indeed express to the Arabs that "the independence of the Arabs is the clear desire of Britain."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] British representatives and several Jewish representatives held an informal meeting this afternoon, which lasted half an hour. It is heard that the Jewish attitude has not changed. After the Jewish Committee meets on Monday, discussions will continue. At that time, the Jewish attitude will be determined.</p>
<p>Flying Hotel Sister Plane Named in the United States [Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Pan American Airlines' new 74-seat flying boat will begin regular service on the Atlantic route in a few weeks. Today, Mrs. Roosevelt presided over the naming ceremony at the Anacostia Naval Air Station. It was named "Yankee Clipper". The naming ceremony abandoned champagne and used a water bottle, which contained water from seven oceans. It is said that the flying boat is a sister plane to the "Flying Hotel" that recently crossed the Pacific to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Film and Drama on Women's Day: Women and the Male-Centric Society in Film and Drama - A Female-Centric View by Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>From a biological perspective, film and drama tap into three innate human "drives" (or impulses): the self-preservation drive, the sexual drive, and the self-defense drive. These are the fundamental forces that sustain human production, survival, and growth, and they are also the most primal and powerful subjects in film and drama.</p>
<p>Many historical tragedies of character stem from an overweening ego, excessive ambition, building a "tower to fall from." In Greek tragedies, hubris and pride offend the gods or fate, or pursuing miscalculated ambitions (fighting a losing battle) all have the self-preservation drive as their tragic core. This "self" often represents not just an individual, but a place, a social class, a nation's selfishness and prejudice. Napoleon Crossing the Rubicon, and the Macbeths who both meet their doom, are excellent dramatic examples of this "self-preservation drive."</p>
<p>Sexual joy is an eternal subject in art. Likewise, "love is nature's trick to compel the prolongation of its existence." Love is a device of drama and film. No two loves are ever exactly alike, making it an ever-novel and interesting subject. The sexual drive, being closer to natural human life, is the most enduring, widespread, and diverse motivation in drama. This force faces the most obstacles, is most prone to encountering enemies, and is most susceptible to disagreement. In other words, it is inseparable from social relationships, making it often profoundly moving. From Paris's love for Helen onwards, the sexual drive has become an indispensable element in drama and film.</p>
<p>The self-defense drive is the opposite of the self-preservation drive: the latter is oppression, the former is resistance. In popular drama, whether depicting social or popular issues, the underlying force is undoubtedly the self-defense drive.</p>
<p>These three drives are not mechanically isolated. Life itself is an interweaving of these three, especially the sexual drive, whose content is intertwined with limitless human emotions, social aspects, and struggles. Male-female issues become even more legendary in drama and film.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>From a social viewpoint, drama and film are records of constant, diverse struggles, reflecting how a new society is gestating and how an old society is decaying. They depict a specific instance within this struggle and change, whether a success story or a tale of sacrifice. From these fleshy narratives, we can grasp the core of the struggle.</p>
<p>Such figures, starting with the Virgin Mary, are often women. Since the dawn of human "civilization," male-centric private property societies have existed. Among all the oppressed slaves, women have suffered the most, constantly groaning under the burden of dual oppression.</p>
<p>Drama, good drama, should be the cries and resistance of the oppressed. Because women have not yet achieved complete liberation, the woman question remains one of the best themes in drama and film.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>We must not forget that in Greek drama, women still held a "human position." In Roman drama, they became "primarily an object of desire," only to be consciously restored to a reasonable status after Ibsen. In other words, the more women are oppressed in society, the more important their position becomes in drama and film. In feudal society, she is a "vulnerable item" defended by knights; in capitalist society, she is an idol (a plaything). As either objects or divine beings, their distorted circumstances create their importance in drama and film. In socialist societies, where women face less oppression, their position in drama and film becomes more rational – they are human beings like men. This proves that in male-centric societies, drama and film are more female-centric. When men and women can stand on equal footing and work together, the spell of women will inevitably be broken, and the struggle against oppression, brutality, and cultural robbers will become the most important focus.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>In wartime China, the female-centric state of drama and film persists, and for social reasons. On the bright side, Chinese women have roared, shattering five thousand years of shackles, stepping into factories and battlefields, achieving many heroic feats. Their posture is so moving and lovable that it can inspire the "poor and weak" to aspire to greatness. In the war of resistance, this female-centric perspective is another aspect of liberation. On the dark side, the higher status of "Dan" roles over "Qingyi" roles in old operas, and the higher pay of female film stars than male stars, merely indicate that male rulers continue to treat women as "objects of desire." This is an evasion of or rebellion against the war of resistance, and by no means a good sign.</p>
<p>Only the war of resistance, striving for national freedom, can transform drama and film from a distorted female-centric state into a normal state of male-female collaboration. In other words, the liberation of women must be achieved through the liberation of the nation.</p>
<p>Theater Movement News: A Week of Theater Movement in the Isolated Island [Continued] Wei Lan</p>
<p>These schools have both advantages and disadvantages. They do not have special provisions for poor students, but they do lend tuition fees to general poor students, tentatively capped at thirty students per class. However, in addition to waiving tuition fees of fifty yuan per semester, they still need to pay miscellaneous fees, a deposit, and other expenses amounting to over twenty yuan. After graduation, students must serve in the school or its affiliated institutions for a certain period. Although there are subsidies or salaries to be earned, some people think this method is too rigid!</p>
<p>Regarding stage technology, there used to be a store specializing in renting scenery before the war, but it no longer exists. A group of comrades dedicated to spoken drama have recently organized a "Shanghai Theater Work Service Cooperative," purchasing scenery, lighting, and other equipment as a cooperative to serve small theater groups lacking stage equipment, facilitating their performances, and charging only a very low price. This service cooperative has been established for more than three months, and many small theater groups are in contact with it. The "prosperity" is quite considerable, which can be said to be a very good work in the theater movement.</p>
<p>Seven, The Rising Red Star Troupe</p>
<p>Following the dissolution of the "Shanghai Drama Academy" and the "Xiaofeng Troupe," another large theater troupe has emerged. This is the "Red Star Troupe," founded by Wang Yigong, Huang Tianmin, and Wu Xudong from the film industry, with a capital of about ten thousand yuan. It has signed a four-month contract with the "Queen's Theater," preparing to perform every day with four plays per month, each play running for one week, divided into three groups for rehearsals. In terms of talent, You Jing, Xu Xingzhi, Wu Renzhi, and others have been contacted to serve as members of the writing and directing committee. Actors include Zhou Xuan, Xia Xia, Zhou Qi, Xu Li, Su Ze, and newcomers selected from the Star Performing Arts Training Institute. The troupe premiered "Night of Carnival" at the Queen's Theater on the evening of December 30, directed by Hu Xudong (actually directed by Xu Xingzhi). The box office was quite crowded, and the results were considerable. Subsequent performances included "The Beginning of Man," the long play "Women's Apartment," and "Peach Blossom Spring," which is also in rehearsal. Although this troupe once caused a sensation in the spoken drama scene at the time and made a considerable contribution to the isolated island's theater movement, its artistic standards were not very high due to its over-reliance on commercialization to determine its operating principles, too much emphasis on the implementation of "professionalization," and a less serious attitude towards work.</p>
<p>Eight, Theater Publications and New Plays</p>
<p>The number of theater publications in Shanghai in recent months is far less than before. "Drama Magazine" was founded in September and appeared with a theoretical, reporting, and introductory attitude, but its content seems a little naive. One issue is published every month, and it has now been published to the fifth issue. On November 20, the inaugural issue of "Theater Art" was published. It is a monthly magazine dedicated to introducing foreign theater theories and plays, with very exciting content and very rigorous theories, especially focusing on the introduction of stage technology. It is a rare publication, but it is too far from the reality of the war of resistance! "Drama," published every Sunday in the "Guide," is also very substantial and especially emphasizes practical theory. In addition, "Weekend," published every Saturday in the Great Beauty Evening News, often publishes manuscripts on spoken drama. "Recreation World" in Shen Bao on Sundays also often publishes theater movement information. There is also a theater publication "The Forties" currently in preparation, and it is feared that it will also be born by the time this article is published.</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, the publishing industry has suffered great damage, so the production and publication of plays have also suffered great obstacles, and the already desolate theater scene has become even more desolate.</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai has slowly published a few plays, but translations account for the majority, which is also due to Shanghai's political environment.</p>
<p>The following are worth introducing to everyone:</p>
<p>"The Beginning of Man" (Topze) by the French author Barjolais, translated by Zheng Yanyi and adapted by Gu Zhongyi, is a four-act comedy, priced at forty cents. This play previously had a Chinese translation, "Elementary School Teacher."</p>
<p>"The Struggle of Love and Death" (Le jeu dee A etela Mort) by the French author Romain Rolland, retranslated by Li Jianwu, is a French revolutionary historical drama, a very long one-act tragic work, priced at thirty cents.</p>
<p>"Before Breakfast" by the American author Eugene O'Neill, translated by Fan Fang, is a new type of one-act play, priced at ten cents. This play is very novel, with only one female character, and its performance in Shanghai was very effective.</p>
<p>"Courtesan" (Loparfsenne) by the French author H. Beeque, translated by Yue Huan, is a multi-act play, priced at fifty cents.</p>
<p>The famous Chinese playwright You Jingliu stayed in Shanghai and recently published "Women's Apartment" and "Tears Splashed on Flowers" under the pen name "Yu Ling." The former focuses on women as the main theme and has been performed many times in Shanghai with good results. It is a four-act long play, priced at thirty-five cents. The latter has also been published and is a four-act tragedy.</p>
<p>Aying, the author of the famous play "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain," also stayed in Shanghai. Recently, he published the long play "Peach Blossom Spring" under the pen name Ying Jun. This play is an allegorical symbolic play with good content and has already been staged in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, "Private Lives" by Noel Coward, translated by Fang Xin, is a three-act comedy, and "Family of Liars," compiled and translated by Li Jianwu, has also been published recently.</p>
<p>Nine, A New Struggle is Underway</p>
<p>The environment of the isolated island is so difficult, and in the land and among the people who have lost the comfort of the motherland, all are suffering unbearable pain. However, the struggle of the soil writers continues unabated!</p>
<p>The following news is worth reporting in recent months:</p>
<p>Guanghua University performed "Realized Dreams" at the YMCA on December 7th and 8th. This is a three-act long play, directed by Wu Renzhi. Xiao Feng, Guo Yuanliang, Yuan Rongxiang, and others played important roles. The director and actors are all well-known, so the performance was very successful.</p>
<p>The Ant Bee Drama Society's "Abandonment" has premiered with good results. It was directed by Jin Xin. It is now starting to rehearse "Money," directed by Hu Dao. The society also plans to rehearse two new one-act plays published in the second issue of Theater Art: "Two Friends in Distress," adapted by Lan Yang, and "Ten O'Clock," translated by Sha Su.</p>
<p>The Wild Goose Drama Troupe of the Post Office Savings and Remittance Bureau is currently rehearsing the satirical comedy "The Gentleman's Treat" and "Spring Returns," as well as "Chief Blanc," etc., directed by Wei Lan, which will be performed in mid-February.</p>
<p>The Sino-French Drama and Art School is currently rehearsing Ying Jun's famous work "Peach Blossom Spring," directed by Ren Yongliang. At the same time, the song and dance drama "Infant Tree Flower," written and directed by Wu Xiaobang, is also being rehearsed. The Kunqu Opera department will also perform at the same time, so "Sino-French" has been quite tense in recent months.</p>
<p>In short, although the isolated island is "isolated," the theater movement is gradually raising its head. As 1938 strides towards 1939, the new flowers of hope will surely bloom brilliantly! Naturally, in the current situation, there is still a lack of talent, plays, and finances, but what is gratifying is that everyone is willing to work hard and unite in this harsh environment. They are still striving for Shanghai's freedom and are trying to choose materials for plays that are conducive to the war of resistance, although a few performances are still backward and boring.</p>
<p>The efforts of the theater workers on the isolated island are worthy of admiration. They have shed a lot of blood and sweat in the past year, and now they are rushing forward with the new year of 1939. Their future is bright!</p>
<p>(Postscript) The author drafted this article very hastily, and the collection and reference of materials are not very sufficient, so there are bound to be omissions and errors. I hope readers will understand!</p>
<p>January 25, 1938</p>
<p>The Huanghuagang Joint Performance in Shanghai is Underway: The Hong Kong Drama Community is Fully Mobilized by Bai Shui</p>
<p>The Hong Kong drama movement has progressed from poverty to soundness, and from dispersion to seriousness. This phenomenon shows the progress of Hong Kong theater workers' awareness in the war of resistance, and it also shows that the national war of resistance is advancing towards victory.</p>
<p>In order to more broadly win over the field of our work and strengthen the united front, and especially how to strive for a favorable working environment to coordinate with the national war of resistance and unleash the function of struggle, it is urgent to promote and encourage the work.</p>
<p>The arrival of Huanghuagang National Memorial Day undoubtedly has special significance for us, and it is summoning the Hong Kong theater scene to be fully mobilized under a more progressive banner of unity. Holding a joint grand performance with plays that are the richest and most combative materials of the national revolution is a glorious task.</p>
<p>Under the call and initiation of the China Arts Drama Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and the Guangdong Drama Association Hong Kong Residents Association, the work of fully mobilizing the entire Hong Kong drama community to hold a joint performance on the national holiday of "Huanghuagang" has begun.</p>
<p>At around 1:00 PM on February 26th, the first Hong Kong Theater Troupe Representatives Talk was held at the Kowloon China Amateur School.</p>
<p>There are indeed quite a few of the large theaters, China Arts, China Travel, Times, Hong Kong Drama Association, Guangdong Drama Association, Iron Current, Le Men, Lu Feng, Amateur, Amateur Union, Black and White, Ding Chou, Pioneer, New Voice, China, Red and White, Self-Reliance, Ant Discussion, Women's Fourth Federation, Youth Club, etc. More than 20 communities, such as Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, Mr. Hu Chunbing, ... etc. also arrived, with the number reaching more than 70 people. This kind of meeting of theater people full of enthusiasm is the first after the beginning of 1939!</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Chunbing served as the chairman. He represented the three initiating groups to report on the process of this preparatory work, and then put forward very concrete opinions for everyone to discuss.</p>
<p>Every theater worker is so humble, frank, and enthusiastic in the discussion. Undoubtedly, under the banner of strict and great unity, everyone contributed their most precious opinions. Finally, many methods regarding the joint performance were also approved.</p>
<p>The Kuanzi Joint Performance is a charity performance for the purpose of helping refugees, so it is a charity performance. If all the expenses of this joint performance are paid by a certain community or institution, then all the income in the future will be used by the community to distribute disaster relief. Now there is another opinion that the General Assembly should solicit performance expenses from social celebrities or various communities, then the funds raised in the future will be sent to charitable organizations for disaster relief in the name of the Joint Performance General Assembly. This is the opinion regarding expenses, but the specific details have now been contacted by the Standing Committee of the Joint Performance General Assembly.</p>
<p>This performance will adopt a hybrid joint performance, because the play "Huanghuagang" is a total of four acts and six scenes [with a prologue and epilogue], and requires 70 or 80 actors, and backstage staff also need to reach hundreds of people. It is estimated that more than 200 people will be needed, so it is natural to mobilize all Hong Kong theater workers to work together. This grand joint performance has not yet been held in China, only once in Guangzhou last year, so Hong Kong is considered an initiative. This initiative is to make a glorious and brilliant record in the history of the Hong Kong theater movement!</p>
<p>In order to make the work responsible and systematic, the Standing Council was elected at the talk that day: Secretary Zhongyi (Li Hua), Director of Drama Affairs Zheng Zhu Baishui, Deputy Director Tieliu (Zuo Jiu), Director of General Affairs Zheng Times (Zhang Chishun), Deputy Director (Weng Gefen), Director of Propaganda Guangdong Drama Association (Li Shulun), Deputy Director Zhonglv (Jia Bao). In the past few days, they have already started working intensely with Zhongyi as the office.</p>
<p>Because "Huanghuagang" is a heavy and multi-act play, a director team was formed. It has now been decided that the people responsible for directing are as follows: Lu Dun prologue and epilogue, Li Jingbo Act I, Tang Huaiqiu Act II, Hu Chunbing Act III, Ouyang Yuqian Act IV. In the future, the rehearsal locations will probably be divided into two places, Hong Kong and Kowloon, to facilitate the actors of various theater groups. Hu Chunbing is currently responsible for the overall organization of the script.</p>
<p>This joint performance hopes to achieve greater gains in terms of materials and publicity, so it will expand the performance dates from three days to five days; at the same time, this work is vast and extraordinary, and it is impossible without full mobilization, so it is hoped that the various theater groups that have not yet participated will actively participate!</p>
<p>--May all Hong Kong theater workers be fully mobilized under the united banner of the "Huanghuagang" Joint... under the vast call!</p>

<p>Stage Techniques by Lu Dun</p>
<p>Three, The Beginning of Work</p>
<p>The beginning of a director's work is not at the time of starting rehearsals, but before the rehearsals begin. First, some preparatory work must be done, mainly including the following three items:</p>
<p>(A) The selection and analysis of the script.</p>
<p>(B) The selection and distribution of roles.</p>
<p>(C) The determination of stage setting.</p>
<p>The performance of a drama mainly conveys the content and ideology of the script to the audience. Therefore, the selection of the script is a very important task. According to the current situation, the director has a very heavy responsibility for the selection of the script.</p>
<p>The main thing in choosing a script is to see whether its content and ideology are correct. Especially under the current circumstances, the selection of the script must prioritize those that are beneficial to the war of resistance and have an active theme. In addition to correct ideology, it is also necessary to have excellent formal skills. Even with correct content, without matching form and excellent skills, the correct ideology cannot be expressed, let alone conveyed to the audience.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to see whether the time, place—environmental conditions, and stage conditions are suitable. For example, when performing in the countryside, if you choose a "Sunrise," the villagers will not be able to understand the life written in the play, which is equivalent to playing the lute to a cow. Or, if you suddenly perform a "Defend Lugou Bridge" now, it is also inappropriate. In short, the selection of the script should be matched with all aspects of conditions, to see whether the stage conditions can be achieved, and also to consider the audience, so that it is easier to obtain the desired effect.</p>
<p>After the script is selected, the director also needs to do some work on the script. Here, in order to save trouble, let's give an example: Max Reinhardt spent six months working on the analysis of the script before starting the rehearsals. He made annotations and explanations for every word and every action in the original script. These explanations included everything in the script: actors' postures, voices, movements, rhythms, intensity... scenery and all the trivial matters on the stage. He studied and observed from every angle of the play. He himself served as all the essential elements—actors, stage designers, costume designers, musicians... Only after this preparatory work was completed did he officially start rehearsing.</p>
<p>Under the current theater movement situation, although we do not have this kind of good environment, nor are you allowed to have this long time to study, this kind of careful and serious spirit is something that everyone who is not a director must possess.</p>
<p>The selection and distribution of roles is not a very difficult task (in our current situation). If it is an already organized theater troupe, then the personality of each actor and the type of role they are good at playing are already known, so it is not difficult to distribute them. If you encounter new actors without stage experience, you can look at their physique, pay attention to their contours and demeanor, and ask them to recite a few lines, and you will already have an idea. Because a sonorous voice that can be used freely is the actor's first asset, and this cannot be obtained by practicing in a short period of time. Otherwise, try their expressions again, and you can roughly decide.</p>
<p>However, what you should pay special attention to is never to use the actor's usual actions as the standard for role distribution. For example, calling a person who loves to talk and make noise to play a humorous role, or calling a quiet and taciturn person to play a tragic role, will not be successful, but will often fail. This kind of actor class has a common saying called "behind-the-scenes boss," who is extremely lively behind the scenes. Once on stage, they are as dull as a wooden chicken, because daily life is ultimately different from the life to be expressed on stage. In daily life, we can completely vent ourselves, but on stage, we must restrain ourselves. Therefore, when selecting roles, it is best to first pay attention to an actor's ability to restrain, and then look at their ability to express.</p>
<p>After the script has been selected and the roles have been roughly distributed, there is another important task, which is the determination of the stage setting.</p>
<p>The stage setting was originally an independent department, and it is necessary to have an expert in charge. However, the director has the right to provide opinions or make modifications to the composition and design. The stage setting occupies the entire stage space and is what the audience comes into contact with the most. At the same time, the setting design and application have a very close relationship with the performance method of the drama. If the director decides that a certain play should be performed using realistic methods, then the stage setting must use realistic methods. At the same time, the position of the setting (including the arrangement of large and small props) has a great relationship with the position of the actors' activities. In addition, the stage setting occupies a major component in the completion of the dramatic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Famous directors have mostly been famous stage decorators at the same time. The progress of modern stage decoration has made the performance methods improve day by day; new performance methods must be matched with new stage decorations, and new stage decorations can help create new performance methods.</p>
<p>When studying and analyzing the script, the director can simultaneously study the design drawings or rough outlines of the stage setting with the decorator, and must coordinate with the performance method to ensure that the whole is harmonious and does not conflict with each other, in order to achieve the success of the entire performance.</p>

<p>Sports News: Combined Chinese and Western Armies to Compete for the Governor's Cup Today; A Win or Draw Will Give the Chinese Team the Championship</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The red blooms urged the plum blossoms to bloom, and the green fatigue climbed up the willow branches. Hong Kong, hidden in the mountains and waters, is even more beautiful and lovely since the spring came to the world. People are in this time and place, as if in a paradise, but looking back at the rivers and mountains of the motherland, the atmosphere of × is fierce, and saving the country and resisting × are the things to return to. We are living here, and we must live in peace and think of danger, and not forget the loyal and brave soldiers of the motherland, who are resisting the invading demons in the icy and snowy land.</p>
<p>I was writing about football and actually said the above words, which is a far cry from the topic. However, the slogan of "saving the country through sports" has long been shouted by someone. I am afraid that the compatriots who are in paradise will be transferred by a special environment and forget that the country is in dire straits, so I unknowingly wrote those extraneous words, hoping that everyone will wake up.</p>
<p>Watching a football game is a more beneficial and uplifting entertainment. Especially today's Governor's Cup game held in Kajiyama will definitely be more exciting. Those who are addicted to football must watch it, and those who are not addicted to football may as well watch it, because watching the ball to relieve boredom is better than seeking sound and color music.</p>
<p>This cup was born in 1932 and has a history of seven years. Calculating the past football accounts, the General Union West Union team has won the championship four times, and the Association China Union team has won it about ten times. Speaking of it is quite ashamed, only won it twice. Speaking of things according to the facts, in the recent six or seven years, the Hong Kong Chinese football circle has already reached a fairly developed era. There are many talents, and the strength is also strong, but whenever competing for this championship, China Union always loses more than it wins. After careful consideration, the overall essence of the Chinese football circle is not absolutely strong.</p>
<p>This time, the Chinese Union's selection of people has met the ideal and there is no dissatisfaction. Although the "football circle model" Li Huitang does not exert his strength, it seems that there is a fly in the ointment, but with Chen Dehui as the center, his impact power has not diminished slightly, only Huitang's shooting is more sure.</p>
<p>First, the two formations will be deployed, and then other things will be discussed.</p>
<p>Association China Union Team</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai (South China South)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South China South) Mai Shaohan (South China South)</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Liang Rongzhao (South China South Captain) Song Lingsheng (Oriental Club)</p>
<p>Hou Chengtuo (Oriental Club) Li Zhaorong (South China South) Chen Dehui (South China South)</p>
<p>Jing Xiang (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)</p>
<p>(Reserves) Hui Zhongyun, Li Deqi (Oriental Club) Yang Shuiyi (South China China) Liu Qingcai (South China South)</p>
<p>General Union West Union Team</p>
<p>Shi Han (Middlesex) Parker (Police Club) Liao Yachen (Kowloon Club) Gaoshan Slave (St. Joseph)</p>
<p>Captain</p>
<p>Hai Li (Kowloon Club) Billy Ban (Police Club)</p>
<p>Di Chen (Navy Team) Fei Shiwater (Middlesex)</p>
<p>He Xi (Su Huang Army) Ge Ni (Middlesex) Yan Bachen (Military Supply Team)</p>
<p>(Reserves) Wu Liezhi (Kowloon Club) Bi Lu Du (St. Joseph) Yi Shi Du Lanchi (Hong Kong Club) Shi Di (Middlesex)</p>
<p>Each member of China Union is accustomed to cooperation, and the team's liaison work will definitely be more meticulous than that of the West Union, and the technology of each member has always been in good condition. Today, I only ask for more effort and there will be a greater contribution. As for the strategic issues, because they are so varied, there is no certainty, but the most important thing is not to be rigid. If it is rigid, the progress will be slow and fruitless. If they can all exert their best, adapt to the times, and achieve the wonderful effect of echoing each other before and after, and work hard to open up the situation, then they will not worry about not winning.</p>
<p>In an important game, the issue of victory or defeat is most related to the forwards, because this line is the backbone of the entire team. If its support is strong, it will win; otherwise, it will fail. Therefore, I extremely hope that the three outstanding forwards of China Union must make a great determination in this game. If they can take care of both front and back and not give others an opportunity, then the victory is guaranteed.</p>
<p>It is a mistake for the West Union not to use Gao Shannu as the center forward, and its arrangement is beneficial to China Union. I certainly do not want to see it make any further changes and achieve perfection. I also predict that its front line will have the disadvantage of fighting for itself because each player is not accustomed to working together. However, they are all good at sprinting, so the defenders of China Union should be extra careful. As for the inner defenders, there are both virtual and real. The real ones are obstacles to the China Union line, and the virtual ones must have loopholes to find to cope with the five tigers of China Union's extremely connected front line. I believe that they will sometimes be caught off guard and</p>
