<h3 id="c1">祝全國教育會議開幕 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>全國敎育會議，定期今日於重慶開慕，本港僑胞敎育界領袖，亦多前往參加，在此抗戰正由第一階段轉向第二階段之緊要時期，吾人對此敎育全國人民培植萬千幹部完成抗戰建國大業有重大關係之會議，不能不致其誠摯之期望與祝意，而謹献吾人一得之愚，以供吾出席會議諸君與全國敎育界採擇參玫。</p>
<p>全面抗戰開展以來，我國敎育制度，已經開始急劇之轉變，尤以西北各戰區內之敎育，開始急速度之進步。但是一般的說起來，究竟還沒有一個適應抗戰需要的整個制度的改進，這對於推進全面抗戰與建設三民主義共和國的大業，實屬非常遺憾之事，我們今日卽應集中力量於此。不久以前中共六中全會，曾有「實行抗戰教育政策，使敎育爲長期戰爭服務」之决議，敎育專家陶行知先生等亦曾大聲倡導「實施全面敎育，配合全面抗戰」，其後國民黨五中全會及最近國民參政會第三次大會，對於改進敎育，均有極關重要的决議。我們希望這次全國敎育會議，能够依據這些號召和决議，參照抗戰形勢的發展及建國前途的需要，確定整個敎育的改進，同時希望全國敎育界遵照上述號召及决議案的根本原則，就抗戰需要及各地實情，率先實施。這是一。</p>
<p>最近閉慕的國民參政會第三次大會，關於改進全國敎育的决議案中，如劉衡靜等二十三人所提「中央義務敎育經費，應照原定計劃，逐年加倍增撥，以推進戰區及後方各省義務教育案」，「下年度預算中增加普通敎育文化經費以便積極推進國民敎靑案」，胡石靑等廿八人所提「政府增撥專欽，組織並擴充特種敎育以發揮敎育效能增加抗戰力量案」，陳時等廿二人所提，急救淪陷區靑年免爲×用案。，羅衡等廿四人所提「培植邊務人才，以固國防案」，馬亮等二十一人所提「溝通各民族情感，建設蒙囘藏特殊敎育及訓練大量內地人士嫻熟各民族語言，文字案』，鄒韜奮等四十四人所提「動員全國知識份子掃除文盲，普及民衆意識以利抗戰建國案」等等，都是適應當前抗戰需要的重要决議案，全國教育會議必能參照這些决議，規定具體實施辦法。同時希望全國各海外僑胞敎育界加以熱烈的擁護，務求其於最短時期內獲得實現。這是一一。</p>
<p>關於整個抗戰敎育政策的實施，以吾人所見，最重要者當爲（一）學制之改訂，（二）組織之充實與擴展，（三）特種敎育之推進三端。首言學制之改訂，其要旨當在廢除過去不急需與不必要的課程，改革不合理的學校管理制度，以便敎授抗戰建國時期所必需的新課程，同時注意於學生對於學習上積極性的發揚。其次，關於組織之充實與擴展，主要的是淪陷區內及後方各省教育組織的充實與擴展，同時尤當加緊建立及擴展全國敎育界的抗×民族統一戰綫，而海外華僑敎育界，尤應成爲此統一戰綫上的基本單位之一。最後，關於特種敎育之推進，主要的當爲下列三點，卽第一，要創設並擴大增强各種幹部學校，趕緊培養大批抗戰建國的靑年幹部；第二，要廣泛發展民衆教育，組織各種補習學校，推進全國的識字運動，戲劇運動，歌詠運動，體育運動，同時趕緊多多創辦×前×後各種地方通俗報紙，提高一般國人的民族文化與民族覺悟；第三，要廣泛地積極地興辦義務的小學敎育，發揚中華民族的精神，培養將來建設民主共和的新中國以便實現澈底的三民主義的理想國家的新後代！吾人希望全國敎育會議和國內外敎育界對此三點予以特注意。這是三。</p>
<p>上述三者，都是根據目前抗戰新階段新需要而改進全國敎育的基本原則與主要辦法，相信全國敎育會議必能有更滿意的决議，吾人謹敢向出席諸君遙致敬意，尤盼全國敎育界積極起來，準備爲完成新的任務而奮鬬。</p>
<h3 id="c2">田漢暢談戲劇劇及其他 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>也許這是旅行幸運吧：在長沙短短一二日間，　巧還得欣賞從焦土上開出的藝術之花——革命劇作家田漢先生在一個紀念日臨時倡演的改良湘劇！</p>
<p>時間在下午八時至十一時，地點在銀宮影戲院。該院要算長沙大火後惟一倖存的藝術之宮了：新式建築，規模宏大，觀衆速坐帶立，大約可容二三千人，記者聞風而往，早已　得滿滿的了，但門前幷木高懸「客滿」牌，因爲是公演給民衆白有的。</p>
<p>戲目計有四齣，我僅看見田先生改良「別密從軍」的尾戲及雋湘戲「蔡文參代夫從軍一的全齣。演員多數是十五六歲的女孩子，扮相，唱作及劇詞，都各有特殊的動人處。</p>
<p>田先生及影戲名導演洪深先生，均雜坐觀衆中。當時承一位極賣力的女服務員，如射箭地一般引我穿進觀衆壁壘中、去找他們：田先生帶草綠色軍帽，穿毛領皮面短大，正坐昂視，儼然是個短小精悍的帶兵官：洪先生則坐其後排，亦全副武裝，且身軀魁偉，態度莊重，與戰前影壇導演姿態如出兩人。</p>
<p>我個人有這樣的一個槪念：中國以抗戰而提高國際地位，各私人亦以參加抗戰工作而彷彿偉大起來，大槪因爲國格人格同樣撐得起腰幹來了吧！同時「臨水裁花須有意，一枝常作兩枝看，」我　田洪兩先生之看戲，似乎不單純爲看戲而看戲，顯然他們還多操着一番心思，所以看得　外的出神。</p>
<p>我怕攪擾旁人的觀聽，初和他們見面，僅相視一首便在田先生左近的一個位子擠坐下去。那時戲正演到精彩處，觀衆屏息靜聽台上唱詞。田先生輕聲問我：『湖南高腔戲看過沒有？』我說「沒有。』他微笑着向台上一顧：『這就是湖南高腔戲！』倒使我有點不好意思。</p>
<p>在我——外行人看來，他省土劇與唱高腔的，還有川劇。差不多十齣有六七齣要唱高腔，其次桂戲，也間夾唱着一點，不過它們的音調，却高亢宏放些，比較湘劇的尖銳細膩，稍有不同而已，田先生對湘劇高腔的評價，說它普樂水準很島，是中國戲劇的一座名貴寶庫，這當然另有他獨到的見解。</p>
<p>湘劇與平劇的比較，田先生也談到一點：他說：湘劇長處，多屬於人情劇方面，眞實，熱情，細膩，素淡，幽婉，總之，它的神態全貌，彷彿空谷幽蘭，有一種別具風格的可愛，平劇長處，是專美的，有高度的美化，尤其武戲技術之高超，場面之緊張，還非湘劇所能企及，中國戲劇在外國頂馳名的，不是文劇而是武劇，湘劇對於武戲之缺點，應向平劇學習補救。總之，平湘兩劇演員，能互相觀摩截長補短，定能在戲劇界另開新局面。</p>
<p>任何科學文化及藝術，他的造詣，無論如何，是不能斷定他巳到達至高至上的頂點的。田先生希望戲劇界不要有門戶之見，而故步自封，這番見解，我認爲很對。所幸巳有平湘兩劇隊數十演員，同在他領導之下，正互相歡摩，互相學習着，不久料能獲得圓滿結果，而使兩劇造詣更爲精進。</p>
<p>那夜最末一齣戲演畢後，洪先生因剛由南昌前線轉來，要囘旅館休息，我却和田先生一同到他住處——財政廳去，彼此放大聲音，繼續轔談了一點多鐘。從他離開上海時起，談到現在他正推進中的戲劇宣傳工作，最後還現身說法地涉及他的人生觀，對人生意義尤有精警的發揮。</p>
<p>田先生是前年十一月間於上海淪陷的那天，離開上海到內地來。他說：他過南京時，搬家的就搬得一塌糊塗；公務員尤動搖不堪，據他所看見的許多人中，僅有葉劍英態度抱樂觀。現在抗戰轉入第二期，　觀的人反多如滿天星斗，相與娩美增輝，這倒是意外的好現象。</p>
<p>嗣離京回湘（他是畏沙人），途經南昌，不幸車翻入水，、幾與同車人全被淹死，旣抵長沙，向友人借洋一百五十元，於去年一二八紀念日，創刊「抗戰日報」。四月一日軍委會政治部在武漢成立，郭沫若先生便請他去任該部第三廳第六處處長］負責戲劇宣傳工作。洪深先生即在該處任科長，協助進行一切。</p>
<p>他說：在武漢工作時最有趣的，是舉行「水上火炬大遊行」；上自黃鶴樓江面起，下至漢口下游止，但見千萬穴巨，將江水輝映成一條光明燦爛的金　。另有美術抗戰　　數百幅，在電光反射下，　　舉露，又美觀，又有意義。他當時會作一詩，以紀空前盛况：</p>
<p>人海人山傑閣前，</p>
<p>歌聲電炬起樓船，</p>
<p>江頭野老低聲問，</p>
<p>盛况何如北伐年？</p>
<p>抗戰情緒最高漲的時候，一般藝術家集體創作，在黃鶴樓上　了一圖偉大的抗戰　　，　皇巨　，長達十五丈，竟將整個城牆都圖成畫面，中有人物三萬，表情均生動深刻。此畫若不被×寇塗毀，俟收復失地，再加點綴，大槪可以傳世，</p>
<p>他到第三廳工作後，曾編組得十個抗×演劇隊，兩個孩子劇團，每隊（團）人數，約三四十人；幷在漢口辦了一個「留漢歌劇演員戰時訓練班」，包括平劇，漢劇　　戲，馬戲，雜要等等，計有學員七百餘人。集訓一月餘，所用書籍文憑等經費，爲數僅二百元，</p>
<p>但有次向各學員徵募前綫寒衣捐款，當場即捐得一千四百餘元。中有一人——尙非名角——慨然獨捐一百二十元，竟把校長（田兼任）弄得很　，也只好如數陪捐上一筆。有許多坤角，却將金蓋取下，尤其紛紛將絨綫衣脫下，堆成一個小山堆。她們眞熱心啊—誰見了誰也高興！同時，校中還請陳誠，周恩來，郭沫若，陳立夫，鹿地亘諸先生常來演講，使他們得聽些高深理論，見些名人丯采，他們也表示熱烈歡迎！</p>
<p>田先生縱談到這里，不禁也眉飛色　起來。當時他和黎園羣賢師生雍容一堂的景象，我們還不難於此流風餘韻間想像得出。</p>
<p>在他這位救亡歌劇宗師手下脫穎而出的一般梨園高足，以及各隊（團）的新劇演作健將，多至六千人左右，都統歸政治部節制。不過舊劇演員因職業性質關係，只要所演劇目情節不達悖抗戰宣傳大綱，則一切演作行動，均可能其自由發展。至於新劇演員，即各抗×演劇隊與孩子劇團，則一律受政治部直接指揮，現正分頭在南昌，平江，沙市，桂林，衡陽，貴陽等地工作，但非固定在一地，而是有流動性的。隊中費用，由部發給，每隊員每月約得津貼廿五元，此外另給全隊辦公費若干。一般從事工作的男女靑年，生活非常淸苦；但目的在救國，精神則極興奪而慰快。</p>
<p>長沙大火後？先由漢口撤退來此的一部份平劇演員，鑼鼓停止響聲，沒辦法便來找他們的大宗師——田先生，請求追隨左右，以便再求進步。田先生義不容辭，便把他們連家小全數請到不出租錢的財政廳去住：不過得遵守約法三章：一，打破平劇與地方劇（卽湘劇）的界限，須與原住地方劇演員互相研究學習，各自攝取優點，以便實現他理想中所欲打出的劇界新局面，二，打破演員階級制度，使名角與普通角地位一律平等。三，打破一人唱戲全家坐食的舊俗，凡願參加新時代戲劇工作隊伍的舊劇演員，他的家屬不拘婦人兒童，都要各站住一個表演的崗位。結果，他們完全都接受實行，故成績斐然可觀。我覺得這三項辦法中，第二第三兩項，頗有革命意義，尤値得普遍推行。</p>
<p>他本來是提倡幷編作新劇的名人，但他客觀地說：舊劇給他一個啓示，效力比詁劇還大。中年以上的人，大多數習慣有慣劇；而各中心都而舊劇演員所占數量，亦非常可觀。如上海一埠。卽多至七千餘人，若事先有充分準備，加以嚴密組訓，而在所需劇本材料上，灌輸以新的血素，不是就成爲極好的現成大批宣傳工具　？可惜改革老戲的口號，高唱十多年，而實際上眞能向這方面努力的劇作家，尙寥若晨星，用「舊瓶裝新目」方法產生劇本的，更等於鳳毛麟角呀！田先生講到「劇本荒」這一問題上，他本人也深致歉意，恨不能立刻「掛軍帽」而去，依然去過他的筆桿生涯。</p>
<p>自然，他現在雖然擔着「將字派的黃板板」，實際上幷未與筆桿生涯完全脫節。他從前向友人借錢創辦的那個抗戰日報，已喬遷沅陵復刊，鑄有各號字體五十餘萬，這是他的一個正在枝葉扶蘇的文化基礎。在此間於大火後，另辦有一種小型的「新長沙報」，惟因另有其他大報，且紙料缺乏關係。最近復擬停刊。但念專，該戰的六七十個小報販，生活無法解决，只好勉爲其難。仍然掙扎出版。這批小報　，當初全是十一二歲的街頭流浪兒童，被該報收容訓練出來的。暇時還敎他們唱歌演劇，才能幷不在兒童劇團之下。</p>
<p>關子這，我倒不是佩服田先生一片婆心，大有慈善家的作爲，而是欽佩他有『有敎無類」的精神，又實騐出這般被社會遺棄的可憐的孩子，他們同樣具有某一方面的才能，假使他們得異席寶履厚的子弟受同等敎育，以他們特殊環境養成的克苦精神，力求上進，所謂「無心挿柳柳成蔭」，成就恐怕還要比其他幸運子弟，偉大得多呢。所以我竭誠希望從　戰時兒童救濟工作的人員，不應該專注意于戰區有家屬登記的兒童之救護，而應該將眼光分移於就在面前的各地流浪兒童，俾得局沐社會恩光，免有遺珠向　之　。</p>
<p>其後，田先生勢如爆竹的談風，忽從有聲有色的戲劇界說上，輕輕地吹過幽美的音樂領域來了。他本人的昔樂興趣很高，對於名曲作家聶耳，張曙，洗星海　作品，尤盛稱不置。一會兒他俯着改緩了語調說：他從前在南京牢內乍聞聶耳的死訊，曾哭過一次；最近張曙不幸在桂林又被×機炸死，更使他不舒服了好幾天。因張曙十九歲時，即常和他在一道工作，也得到他的好處，也吃過他的虧，同在南京坐過牢。張曙家雖貧窮，但能努力苦幹；性雖　直，但能博聞强記，尤其富有作曲天才，其精心構製的抗戰歌曲，爲數甚多，均傅誦一時。今不幸與其愛女同罹飛災，實不僅是藝術界的大損失也！他說話的語調，已悠婉到不能再悠婉，我本能地向他面部　了一　，原來他已　　淚——那時燭光搖曳，景象倍覺悽凉；我們的談括，也無形停頓了。當時我暗想：田先生之爲人，由此可知不僅是個硬朗的革命劇作家，而且是富於情感的好好先生哩！可是頃刻之間，有一種種好似自空谷吹來，些　　點閘意的輕聲細語，又將我從幽默肅靜的境界中叫轉來傾聽　了。。</p>
<p>「我覺得一個人生命很有限，特別在此抗戰期間」田先生冷冷地說；但空氣仍相當嚴肅：「我們應儘可能的爭取時間，以便對國家民挨和社曾，趕快做些有利益有意義的事業！我個人對於一般工作，特別是做官，要講究應酬，我們這　人實在不來。在政治部不到一年，就已經膩了。合我做的還是拿筆桿子，所以我已去電辭職」。照這樣說來，田先生的確想掛冠高蹈了。</p>
<p>「我從來做事不悲觀，想做的事也常常做到。』他又抖擻起精神繼續說：「同時，生命力也不能浪費。點小官，對國家恐無益，對自己則損害甚大，我將職辭掉，决去沅陵抗戰日報拿筆捍，多寫點對國家社會比做官更有貢献的小册子去！』他的談話，便自此結束。</p>
<p>但我們要記住：一個人生命有限，應乘機程做對國家社會有益的事業，特別當此國家民族與暴×作生死存亡决鬥的大時代，更應將具所長儘量貢献于國家，以免個人虛度光陰，幷使民族受其遺害！</p>

<p>——三月政治報告之三——</p>
<p>在地方方面、主要的是充實省以下的政治機構、我國的政治、中央和地方原爲一整個的機構、無論爲郡、爲州、爲道、爲省、都是因為政便利劃分的區域、省政府爲承上啓下的機關、實在說來、省主席是執行中央法令、宣揚中央德意、撫輯省內人民、並代表中央監督地方政治的長官、至於作戰區域、因爲交通多被×人隔絕、行政督察區、要依據國防交通經濟狀况、重新劃分、確定專員不兼縣長、充實專員公署的組織、使盡專員指揮地方行政機關的責任、縣長爲親民之官、第二期抗戰史要選擇考試、訓練合格、幹練有員爲的人充任、保障他的任期使他放手做去、因爲一偭好縣長所發揮的力量、比一師人還要大、凡是滿五十萬人口的縣份、改爲特等縣、縣長簡任待遇、這是第二期戰時內政計劃的一個要點、關於軍事方面、我現在祇要說一句話、就是我們目前的戰鬥力、無論是在精神上或物質上、都遠勝於七七事變以前、現在我應該略爲說明作戰各省的行政概况、</p>
<p>游擊區內行政</p>
<p>我們平素好用「淪陷區」這一個名詞、其實這個名詞、極不恰當、很容易引起國內及國際間的誤會、×軍所到的地點、都是作戰區域、無論爲陣地戰或運動戰、我們現在試把江蘇浙江福建安徽江西湖北湖南河北河南山東山西等十一省的行政狀况、考察一下、這十一雀共右九百四十一縣、其中五百八十三縣的縣境完整如故、縣長仍駐在縣城照常辦公、這類的縣份佔總數白分之六十二、其次、有三十五縣縣長仍在縣城辦公、縣境的一部份，却暫時被×軍佔領丁、又有二百四十五縣、縣城被×人佔領、但是縣長却仍能在鄕間行使職權、這類佔總數百分之二十六、還有二十三　的縣長，巳移駐鄰縣、可是他們沒有失掉行使職權的能力、他們的命令仍能達到本縣、最後有五十五縣全部爲×人所佔領、縣長的職權一時不能執行、這一類僅佔總數百分之六、並且這五十五縣之中有四十二縣在河北省、而這四十二縣之中、又有二十二縣是在七七事變以前漢奸殷汝耕所組織的「冀東特區」之內、×人經過一年半的血戰以後、新佔領的地方、除北平天津上海南京漢口廣州等市以外、僅祇三十三個縣、在這些市縣裏面、我們的游擊隊猶時常山其不意的給×人種種威脅和打擊、諸位可以看出×人的政治收獲如何細微</p>
<p>當政委會成立</p>
<p>在這個廣大的作戰區域的行政調整、是個很複雜的問題、其重要性並不在整軍之下，政府的調整方案是把作戰區域分爲兩部份、一部份我們可以稱爲最前綫區域、另一部份可以稱爲次前綫區域、中央爲使最前綫區域的黨政軍各機關聯繫密切、效率增强、機構健全、進用雲敏、以適應戰時體制起見、特成立戰地黨政委員會、以期號令統一、步縣整齊、我們相信今後定能從×人的後方給他們更重大的打擊，在次前綫的區域之內、我們也有種種因時因地制宣的辦法、在有些地方我們加重縣長或專員的職柳、使他們便宜行事獨立抗戰、在別的地方如有幾個行政督察區與省政府所在地相隔太遠、交通又常受×人的阻擾、行政院便應省政府的請求准設行署（或辦事處）、這些辦法，都爲適應特殊情形，內政上的工作、除上述各項外、還有幾件値得注意的事、</p>
<p>兵役法的推行</p>
<p>兵役法的推行、在我國原是創舉、在以往曾發生相當的困難、這是諸君深知的、推行兵役的基本條件、必須提高全國人民的抗戰情緒、健全下層的行政機構，使當兵成爲一這種風氣、才能順利無阻、兩種必要條件、在他國都是積數十年的努力、才能達到的、政府改良兵役法的推行，句括提高壯丁待遇、切實優待出征軍人家屬、加緊兵役宣傳、和改善保甲制度、俏若我國四萬萬五千萬人口的二十分之一去服兵役、就能動員二千二百五十萬人、和×國動員的三百萬人比較、七個中國兵去打一個日本兵、××何患不能逐出國境、</p>
<p>改善保甲制度</p>
<p>近年雖有少數人站在學理的觀點上批評我國現行的保甲制度、無論此中是非如何、我們姑且不論、倘若我們沒有保甲制度、兵役簡直無法進行、保甲制度的缺點、當然應改善、玫府决提高保甲長的待遇、愼選保甲的人才入手、具體方案、巳　行政院公布施行了、此外內政辦現正籌劃保甲長的訓練部法、以健强　甲制度、我們希望在最短時期內各省遵照力行（　完待續）</p>

<p>蔣委員長爲以身作則提倡節約献金起見、於廿七日以一萬零六百卅元作爲私人献金。且蔣委員長平日宴客，卽已以不超過一元爲標準。日來屢次用新運總會所倡的自助餐宴客，每份所費僅四五角。蔣夫人宋美齡女士亦以最近爲報章雜誌撰文所得稿費五千六百五十元一併呈献。因此外華人士，亦感而解囊，献金千元。</p>
<p>領袖夫婦此種行爲一方面是對全國以身作朋，足使貪者廉而懦者立，又一方面向全世界表揚中華民族精神之偉大與前途之希望無窮，足以提高國際間的同情援助。</p>
<p>我們抗戰建國是極其艱苦的事業，必須集中統一全國有生無生力量，而集中統一這些力量的、前提，就在每一不願做亡國奴隸的中華兒女，能忍非常之貧乏艱苦。領導抗戰的高級領袖，大都能夠刻苦耐勞，如毛澤東輩之每月祇受報酬國幣二元，久為葉外所稱道。今蔣委員長極力壓低私人生活費用，呈獻給國家民族，自更值得全國愛戴與學習。特別是以蔣委員長之地位與身份，尚規定賽客費用不超過一元的標準（合港幣只有五亳餘！）我們對於自已的日常生活，更應如何反省與矯正！其次，蔣夫人的熱烈献金，尤當使每一豐衣足食的婦女引爲模範。如果每一女子能够力矯時弊，認眞節約，並勉其愛人，丈夫，子女則對於國家民族的補益，將非平常數字所可表現</p>

<p>— 世長譯　原文載二月號Parade雜誌</p>
<p>去年的十月，從北海的沙堆一直到蘇台德區的小山，七千六百萬德國人熱烈地慶祝一個人的誕辰。可是，他們大部分是不歡喜這個人的，同時，更有許多人是痛恨這個人，恐懼這個人的，這個人就是名聞遐爾的德國宣傳部長戈培爾，德國的每一座無綫電台都廣播他的傳記，每一張報紙都登載祝頌他的文章，並且想出種種理由，讚揚他的偉大，這是德國各界慶祝他四十一歲誔辰時的盛况；他爲甚麼這樣受人愛戴和歡迎呢？理由是很簡單的；因爲，如果你不慶賀他的誔生紀念日，很容易的可以他使你坐立不安！</p>
<p>煙霧瀰漫的工業區魯耶，號爲德國鋼業的中心，那裏有一個工廠林立的城市，名呌勒伊達，這就是戈增爾的誕生地，一八九七年十月二十九日，贏弱脚的戈培爾，誕生於一個工人家庭裏，他的父親是工廠的工頭，母親是鐵匠的女兒，這個嬰孩漸漸的長大起來，因爲足部的殘疾，成爲一個步伐蹣跚的跛行兒童，龐大的頭部和他瘦削的肩部，似乎不大相稱，他不能跑得像別的兒童一樣快，所以，他祇有讀書了，在他奇特的頭腦裏，培養了日後的大志和野心。</p>
<p>一九一四年，空前的世界大戰在歐洲爆發，德國的靑年都跑到前綫，參加戰事，可是，十七歲的戈培爾，因爲足部的殘疾，不能服從軍役，他就以讀書代替了軍役，從這一個大學跑到那一們大學，努力研求學識，最後在一九二一年，他以優良的成績獲得漢達堡大學哲學博士的學位，同時，他更研究馬克斯和社會主義。</p>
<p>正當那個時候，德國的革命是在醖釀中，如果法國的軍隊沒有佔領魯耶，出身工人家庭的戈培爾，很有成爲共產主義者的可能，德國人民對於魯耶的失陷，認爲是極大之恥辱，同時，許多工人推翻了聯台「全世界工人」的信心。戈培爾謂想這種國家的瘡痕，終有一天會形成新國家主義的勃興，他更預先見到這種運動是發展他志向的重要工具，一九二二年，他聽到慕尼黑的國社黨組織和它的領袖希特勒；這機，他就找到了心目中的工具。</p>
<p>戈培爾用他卓越的天才，組織了國社黨健全的宣傅機　，他舉辦一理資本很小的報紙，定　一人民自由報』，漸漸的想法發展。沒有一個同事相信他，大家稱他爲「黨中的惡魔」，但是，都一致欽佩他的才幹，最初，他對於希特勒是又恨又愛，妒忌希特勒爲黨中領袖，同時，他又臢頌希特勒，並且很淸楚的知道，促進希特勒的地位是發揭他自己志願的不二法門。</p>
<p>戈培爾受過高深的敎育，學識淵博，常常被譽爲「希特勒的智囊」；他和希特勒的紅人戈　將革，一搭一檔地把國社黨維到成功的路上。當然，幕後的主要人物仍　是希特勒，希特勒大聲疾呼：猶太人和社會主義者的搗亂，使德國在歐戰中可以獲得的光榮勝利，轉變爲可恥的失敗，戈培爾聞訊芝下，到處宣傳，無空不入，並且盡力的利用他的「攻擊報一，把這不顧事實的妄語，帶給全國的民衆，這是排猶運動的由來，無疑的，戈培爾是發起這幕悲劇的要角。</p>
<p>戈培爾在一九二六年後聞名於政洽舞台，一九二八年當選議會議員，一九十一九年　國社黨宣傅主任的要職，一九三三年希特勒奪到政權以後，統任他爲宣傅部長，那時，戈增彌祇有三十六歲，成爲德國有史以來年歲最輕的一位部長，他就任宣傳部長後，立刻控制全國的報紙，電影院，戲劇院和無綫電臺等有關宣傳的各種事業。</p>
<p>全德國的民衆，祇有一小部分歡迎戈培爾，那一小部分是魯耶工業區的工人，戈培爾知道怎樣討好勞工階級，一九二〇年以來，他向柏林工人狂呼過許多次：「起來—年靑的工人們！你們是新德意志的主人！」多麼動人啊！希特勒得到勞工界的擁綫，戈培爾功居第一，但是，國社黨執政以來，對於德國的工人，並沒有甚麼利益，他們是怪可憐的，除了一小部分工人以外，戈培爾得不到人民的絲亳好感，他們喃喃自語，口出怨言，『這傢伙是天生的惡魔，沒有一個誠懇的德國人是像他那磨狡猾奸刁的』！</p>
<p>人民暗地裏口出不平的怨聲。可是仍舊熱烈地慶祝戈培爾的誔辰：因爲，這位宣傅部長手握至高無上的權威，如果你不慶賀他的誕生紀念日，他很容易的可以使你坐立不安！</p>

<h3 id="c46">向青年朋友致熱烈的敬禮！　本報中學生論文賽　今午在勝斯酒店舉行給獎禮 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>先致敬禮！</p>
<p>靑年是抗戰的先鋒，靑年亦是建國的楝樑。本報爲了愛護靑年。爲了希望靑年努力自愛，因此而有本港中學生抗戰論文比賽之舉行，企求藉此鼓舞中學半的寫作興趣以及熱烈地，正確地，展開神聖的救亡工作。</p>
<p>可幸自從消息發表之後，即蒙各校學生踴躍參加，紛紛將徵文交來，這實在是可喜可慰的現象。迄截稿期止，共收到一百四十三篇，業已評判完竣，取錄二十五名，連日並在本報發表，詳細統計，可見今天本報第二版，在此恕不不</p>
<p>記得有人這樣說：外國人開門三件事是：牛奶，麵包，和報紙。可是，我們年靑朋友學習到喝牛奶，吃麵包的似乎不少，學習到看報紙的却並不很多。看　　　而　關心到本報徵文的消息，且鼓得起出氣來應徵、這一百四十三位靑年朋友實在是警覺的靑年，可愛的靑年，向上的靑年。我們應先向參加本報抗戰論文比賽的一百四十三位靑年朋友致熱烈的敬禮。</p>
<p>雖然限於名額我們只取錄二十五名；可是，此外的一百一十八位在思想上，文字上，亦各有所長，我們在精神上獎勉的敬意，亦並無岐視。諸位多了一次學習，長了一次經驗，亦算是有所收穫。本此態度，繼續努力，前途的希望，正未可限量呢。</p>
<p>感人最深的呼籲</p>
<p>這次在一百四十三僩文卷中不消說是各有所長亦各有所短。而某英文書院有一位同學針對着香港的環境，而發出動人的呼籲，實在使我們深深共嗚，熱烈鼓掌，他的原文就是：</p>
<p>「……我們知道香港學生尤其是在英文書院讀着英文的，是最沒有組織與缺乏民族意識。因爲香港社會需要　文，所以在香港爲華人而設的英文書院爲數非常之多。雖其學費甚貴，而學生人數常吿滿額，因爲一般家長希望其弟子於英文畢業後，則可以很容易的到各大洋行，官署找得一官半職。而中文的學科因爲在這樣的環境很少應用，因此，香港英文學生界中，便養成一種非常濃原的重視英文而鄙視國文的洋化空氣』</p>
<p>接着，這位警覺的靑年朋友還說出很多人要說而未說出來的實在話：「關於這憫事實的證明。就是我們常常看見與聽見大此大批的靑年男女，口裏嘰嘰咕咕的談笑着洋話洋腔，大有忘記了自已是中國人之　！』</p>
<p>——有忘記了自已是中國，一字一淚，多麼打動了人們的心弦啊！</p>
<p>「我們要在這樣的環境播送救亡種子，當然先要剷除×××××思想，常常記着祖國的慷大，與關懷祖國的一切</p>
<p>「香港英文學生，因鑒於國難的嚴重，亦有熱血沸騰的呼號着：「我要參加到救亡的隊伍去：我要參加到救亡的隊伍去」！你看，近來香港大學活躍地幹着各種救亡工作，回國服務，亦有美文書院學生的名列」。</p>
<p>香港學生進步的事實多麼使人感奮！祖國正在熱切地盼望這樣覺悟兒的　繼續起來呢！</p>
<p>可喜的現象</p>
<p>這次在一百四十三個文卷中，大多敷在思想上文字上，實在是使我們警喜後生之可畏。祖國在新生中，中華民族的孫子亦英勇地挺進着。</p>
<p>冠軍張大璉君說：『……如果我們自己的理論基礎不打好，怎樣能够去組織和訓練民衆呢……所以第一，對自己先要加强自我敎育……用研究式批評式的態度來讀課外書，用讀書座談會，和自我批判來做讀書的方法……第二對外的救亡工作要從適應環境到改變環境，注重工作的實際，而不重視工作的形式。……爲了眞上的和平，爲了我們永遠的生存，我們要下最大的努力和熱誠，不在意一切的困難和打擊，不躭悮一分鐘的時間，向抗戰的教亡的前途突進』。</p>
<p>亞軍黃寶珍君說：</p>
<p>「縱使有很丰富圓滿的工作計劃，亦不過是一篇好看的文章，於當前局勢，實難針對得到。我們要利用寒假作爲反省及改進的機會……』</p>
<p>此外，還有很多救亡的具體工作，亦多中肯精采，因爲　關係，不便多所　述了。</p>
<p>今天的給獎禮</p>
<p>本報爲紀念此次徵文起見，特定今天下午二時在勝斯酒店二樓舉行給獎禮，並略　茶點聊示敬意。親愛的靑年朋友：來吧，我們熱烈地握起手來！</p>

<p>新界打鼓嶺林馬坑鑛場、由某礦務公司向政府承批開採、僱有礦工達千人之衆、日夜不停開掘、礦坑深入地底內層、詎昨晨四時、竟發生傷斃礦工九名慘劇、在未肇事之先、有九工人奉管工之命、墜入礦底發掘礦產、藉燈火照耀施行開採、該礦底深入地底內層達數丈、詎正當開掘中、有一重約四　之巨石、以坭土浮動關係、致石脚鬆弛、遂致墜下、該九名工人走避不及、當被壓倒、礦塲中人聞悉該九工人被石壓傷、卽下礦底、設法將石　開救護、此九工人中有三人因常時所站位置、適當巨石之衛、乃被壓至頭爆腦裂、手足折斷、內部重傷、當堂斃命、一死者賢臓亦被壓出、死狀奇慘、其餘六人、則幸未被壓死、而亦身受重傷、有被壓斷手足者、有被壓傷身部者、均皆因傷重暈厥、礦中工人將六傷者救出後、即往上水警署報案、該署當値帮辦據報、即派出警探到事調查慘事發生原因、並電召十字車到塲、將六傷者送米九龍醫院救治、至三死者屍骸、則由黑箱車載入九散殮房剖驗、查該九個罹雞工入、皆爲年在廿餘卅歲之靑年云、</p>

<p>昨日大賽馬巳至第三天，便是澳洲馬打此决賽、事前大衆都屬望「覺居來」，或「痴路頓」，或「利胡列」，而總督夫人的「地和尼顏」亦得多數擁護；不料周氏兄弟的「林拉坎芬地」異軍突起，「馬當先，結果榮占首席。勝票每張派銀四百餘元。「痴路頓」和「覺居來』相爭十分劇烈，卒之前者第二，後者第三。「利胡列一跑過了大石鼓後，卽見步步後退，一敗塗地，聞說是足部發生毛病呢！此外全日中凡是熱馬多能成功，好扒逆水的必定十分失望，晏加那生竟變了反常，整日沒有勝一次，其他要算黃淸廉，陶柏林，博亨，馬棄，和普路士五位各勝了兩次，烈打和趙連璧各勝一次，幸而再沒有墜馬的意外事發生，連環彩兩塲同是然馬出來，所以每張只得十二元五毫罷了。今日中國馬冠軍决戰一場，聞余東璇將「奴斯衣力」和「地殺志夫」兩員猛將齊出，向『施路奇禮」挑戰，多數意見以爲「施路奇禮」現在精神健旺，更有博亨騎衛高明，一定能够保持勝利，但有些說「奴斯衣力」實力利害屢創新紀綠，而地殺志夫亦未可輕視輕望打倒前屆冠軍，總之，無論如何，倘若天時地利不變，到時戰局總會非常好看，如果下雨起來。施路奇禮便較占上風了！</p>

<p>【西江快訊】西江前綫×、自大部抽調海南侵載後、日來因失力空虛、已伏處一隅、未敢異動、故載况異常沉寂、全綫×軍無甚增减，惟各　點間×兵、則有調動換防、而西江我游擊團隊亦頻向各點之×進襲，發動游擊戰、以動搖全綫×軍、現我軍事當局、以西江緊張時期、已成過去、特加緊策動民衆、協助正規軍隊、加强防禦實力、準備全綫向×反攻、茲將各情訪誌如下、</p>
<p>西江全線　最近×情</p>
<p>西江×軍、近日因大部抽調、不敷分配、爲掩飾其力量單薄計、除故作頻忙之調動外、並不時發炮向我陣地轟擊、以振發其消沉之士氣、查岡根馬口之×、連日均有發炮向我金利靑岐方面轟擊、漫無目標、我方未予理會、木棉欖崗方面、廿三日有×步騎二百餘　到、並運有山炮多門、架於附近　岡，分派哨兵守望警戒、惟廿五日已有一部退返三水西南、河口方面、廿四日有×兵二三百名、由廣州開至增防、並有糧糈械彈一批、運到西南屯儲、至河淸九江兩龍×軍，本月廿三日起、有一部沿江佛路後撤、集中佛山，企圖水明、現留守九江之×、爲支松守備隊約二百餘人，分駐於市內，及學憲宮沙口各地、又查×自發動海口豋陸後、粵×空軍機隊多調赴海南助戰，連日分向瓊島及粵南各縣肆虐、故西江×禨稍見歛跡、惟最近一二日間、又復活躍、頻飛各縣窺察、但甚少投彈、</p>
<p>兩龍團隊　再度殲×</p>
<p>我潛伏於西江各點線之游擊團隊、，以×軍兵力單薄、爲截斷×軍聯絡呼應起見、遂紛紛發動襲×游擊戰、向盤據各點×軍突擊、廣三路沿綫我游擊隊、日來巳在獅山走馬營小塘各地截擊×運輸車、破壞路　鐵軌等、及向三水西南×營襲擊、月之廿五夜間九時許、我兩龍游擊隊糾集團隊數十人、持快掣駁壳及手提機關、乘×兵深入之際、秘密港抵×營、×哨兵發覺時、我團隊巳衝進、以機槍向×掃射、×兵聆槍聲、卽出而應戰、但以黑夜中、不知我團隊多寡、倉惶狼狽異常、卒斃×十數名、傷十餘名、各隊員以目的已達、遂安全退返原防、×自經此役後、異常恐慌、入晚卽加派步哨於營房附近　戒、不准人民來往、卽日間對我來往鄉民、亦檢查甚嚴云、</p>
<p>軍民合作　力量充強</p>
<p>查三水前綫×軍自退減後、無力西犯、惟我軍事當局、以×人慣於採用聲東擊西之突擊策略，爲愼重起見、仍分飭谷縣政府、各部團隊、加緊策動民衆參加抗戰、協助政府推進各項戰時要務、以鞏衛治安、充强禦×守土力量、現各地軍民合作精神、更見緊張、日　×軍迭次進犯靑歧舊三水、我軍民均能協同抗×、光榮事蹟、已陸續表現、又查西江各縣團隊、自奉第四戰區司令長官命令、撥歸各部防軍及稅警團後、現已分別加入前綫、駐守於蘆苞、馬房、旱塘、蓮塘、大沙、貝水、及古勞三洲一帶、枕戈待命、伺機反攻、現我西江防力異常雄厚、可保無虞云、</p>

<p>【北　快訊】頃接瓊島某地電吿、我軍連日反攻瓊山、迭獲勝利、×軍盤據縣城、郊外駐紮之×軍、已悉數退入城內、城郊附近、已無蹤、本月十八日、我，軍復大舉向定安方面反攻、當地民衆紛起響應、×猝不及防、傷亡二千餘人、刻下瓊島戰事、漸趨穩　、各地抗×自衛團、現正正紛紛投袂而起、準備殺×、民氣激　、得未曾有云、又訊、海外昨到有×艦三十餘艘、似有進犯南　企圖、榆林港亦被×艦封鎖、禁止外輪航行云、</p>

<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>——東江抗戰殉國將士公葬禮速寫——</p>
<p>這是一個光榮而悲壯的葬禮、自　　中包含着一段光榮而悲社的歷史、</p>
<p>記者去年十月十二日、×人從大亞　登陸、估據淡部而後、我們淡水的守軍大水向龍崗和永湖撤退、惟四五一旅九〇二團一營二運的全連十兵和另一部友軍却活著惠淡公路　進、冒着×人成羣飛機的轟炸，一點沒有恐懼和散亂、十三晚安全抵達惠州近郊的小掛榜　問、小掛榜山正扼着由淡交通的中點、爲佛祖　以下的一個　要區、也爲惠州四面的　一重屏蔽、山巒起伏、短榭扶疎、我們在這裏曾建　數道堡壘、所以第二連到達以後、雖然感覺一連人的力量薄弱，而且他們一連的士兵經過了淡水墟的血戰，精神異常的疲乏、可是爲了搶救民族、保衛這道孤　——　州的决心、他們毫不猶豫地、集合了八十多名身體困頓而鬥志激昂的弟兄、堅守着山須的堡壘、準備爲民族留最後的一滴碧血、</p>
<p>十三夜×人跟踪追至小掛榜山麓的麻莊、十四早便開始了攻擊、担任道攻擊任務的是小尾部、初用山砲轟射，隨着步兵衝鋒、自晨至午、我們的堡壘雖被×人的砲彈摧毀了一小部、但我們的士兵還一樣沉着掃　、×人被傷斃的約十餘　、却不能佔得山頭一步於是×機一批批的在上空出現了，一顆顆的炸彈投向山上爆炸、洪大的爆炸聲沒有絲亳動搖了我們戰士的心、第二次的衝鋒又給我們擊斃七八個、第三次才集合了五六百人繞出我們小掛榜山的山後、四面包圍、這特惠城已陷入了混亂狀態、我們這一連的戰士雖知道了×人奸險的陰謀、不過已强盡援絕、祇有全體作偉大的犧牲、用他們的血染　了幾座的堡壘、殉　軍人守土的天　、</p>
<p>自從惠州光復、名紳張友仁先生才去收拾這一批的忠骸、雖經過兩個月的時間、多還沒有化腐、一個個的仍斜傍任壘溝內、手裏雖沒有槍、還緊握住鐵一般的拳頭、有的掙開着雙限、從這一批忠骸的原狀、可知我們戰士們死難時是多麼的英烈、同時各戰士們的屍體上都印有纍纍的彈痕、大約是各戰士成仁後、×人前往刧槍、戰士們鮮紅的血、將與南口寶山一樣的照耀着中華民</p>
<p>所以惠州各界等待張先生拾畢第二連的全連忠骸後、再合上別處所拾獲的遺骸約百具在水簾洞的山上舉行、「東江抗戰殉國將士公葬典禮」、寄託着我們無名的民族英雄們的靈魂、我們瞻仰到一具具棺木中的戰士們僵臥着的忠骸、心裏有了說不出的感動、覺得他們的血已經爲爭求民族的自由而長流、他們的生命已經爲延續民族的生侖而捐棄、然則我們未死的要怎樣賡續先烈們未竟的壯志、這是我們的好榜樣、流着淚血幹嗎、</p>
<p>典禮雖然簡單、可是嚴肅莊穆、每個參加的羣眾都有一顆悲憤而跳躍着的心、他們的眼上浮現出先烈們的血花，他們的脚會　着這血花前進、</p>
<p>最後，把者拿代東江別動　　副司令官草的一副娩聯、作　薦的結東語、</p>
<p>功仁本一途、為　比道名城、尺壘自　肝瞻去。</p>
<p>涕淚非吾願、且盡半杯體酒、明朝還献×××。</p>

<p>— 和</p>
<p>諾梵爾（Norvell）是久居好萊塢的一位著名銀星命運推算家、今年他又用星相學的十二宮推算法、預言本年內各大影星的流年凶吉、雖則我們不能相信這推算一定無誤、可是他旣然留住當地很久、個中情形自然一覽無遺、推測起來、或竟有點小道理在內、姑妄言之、則姑妄聽之、且待事實來做最大的證人、</p>
<p>希迪拉瑪……生於十二月、屬天蠍星（Scorpio）座、（這種十二星座正與我國的十二生肖相當、所不同者、它是以一月作一單位、誕生在某一月的（就屬於某一星座）她的星相表示出她將昇上銀壇的最高會座、而至少還要　三年紅運、再往後看哈、戀愛和婚姻也就來了、她將嫁一個裂片家、或是大導演、總之是一個影業大亨就是了、所不幸者、此次婚事不得長久、終於因性情不合而吿結束、而第三次、才是她眞正美滿的愛情歸宿、</p>
<p>溫毛立斯……這位搖撼了全美少女們心房的靑年男星、正有一個光明燦爛的一九三九年期待着他、他將繼續的受他們擁戰、繼續的大放光芒、但他本年內决不可結婚、否則定有不幸的結果——九年內一定離婚、過此以後、比方說在一九四〇年結婚的語、婚事幸福、而且有做兩個孩子的爸爸的希望、</p>
<p>生日二月十七、正交寶瓶星（Aquarfus）座、這是對於演員們最通合不過的了、像的翰巴里摩亞、阿道夫孟郁、克拉克蓋勃爾和考爾門這幾位赫赫有名的大明星，都是本星座內的人物、</p>
<p>安特拉烈絲……生於八月十八日、日子是大吿大利、命宮屬獅子星（Leo）座、同星座內還有茂娜洛埃、羅拔泰勒、瑙瑪希拉、威廉飽威爾等人、照她在「斷鴻零雁」（滬上譯名、卽Letter　of　Intoductfon）片內的演技看來、本年應當是、而且是她揚眉吐氣的時候，她的婚期當在本年或一九四〇年內，婚後生活美滿、而且並不妨礙她的銀幕生活、</p>
<p>埃洛弗林……六月二十日誕生、屬雙子星（Geminf）座、一九三九年對他小有不利、今年他有因工作過勞而影響健康的危險，但銀幕工作却能繼續成功、星相上指出他有點飛機或車輛的厄運、這也只要當心便可、他將和麗蓮達美塔脫離、而另締良緣、</p>
<p>泰隊飽華……目下、泰隆鮑華之紅，當今諸小生內確是罕與倫比的了、他的誕辰是五月五日、屬金牛星（Taurus）座、本星座是象徵『富有』的、所以無怪乎他能紅透了半片天去、年內流年順利、年終姿小心聲譽低落、照星相上有來、他三年內不可結婚、否則有損於他今日的地位、過了這個時期還有更大的財　、那時候、祇要他自己願意、隨時都可以放棄這種生活、安享淸福去了、</p>
<p>黛妮達麗安……五月一日生、她將和泰隆鮑華一樣的有金錢、有地位、婚姻有兩次、所以、得小心一點啊</p>
<p>愛麗縣費……巧極了、她的誕辰和泰倫鮑華是同月同日、也是五月五日、今後幾年的命運很好、祇有一天比一天的紅上去、因爲由　星相上看來、幾年內在事業上沒有一點遭受挫折的兆頭，也和泰隆鮑華一樣、她銀幕生活的去留、祇有等她自已來决定、迷們是决不會不歡迎她的、</p>
<p>最近影城盛傳她和丈夫湯尼馬丁有卽將脫幅之說、她雖矢口不認、可是瞞不了星相上的顯示，雖則我們很希望她能避免掉這事、（可惜的是據傳他倆已經脫離了）、</p>
<p>琴亞瑟、……這是一位資格較老的女星了、一九三九年內她還能被派演幾个很重要的主角、而五年之內、光芒也不致稍歛、婚姻共有兩次、和黛婫達麗安一樣、</p>
<p>狄娜寶萍……這個可愛的名字、將和我們保持長時期的關係、不久的將來，她將在銀幕上以歌劇（Ｏpera）的姿態演出、而大受歡迎、而且舞台上和無綫電廣播傳影界中出都要有她的芳蹤、那些那是待她去扯服的領域、</p>
<p>米蓋龍尼……影迷們常常担心着、米蓋龍尼漸漸長成了、他是否還能繼續銀幕生活呢、還是向商業方面另謀出路呢、讓我們看看他的他的星相如何，星座是大秤星（Libra）生於九月廿日、……這裏幷沒有他必得要脫離影界的徵象、米蓋長成得當然還能是個演員、而且一樣的受人歡迎、他那淸鮮的個性、孩子氣的演技、將恆一而不變、結婚還早、總要在廿三歲的時候、</p>
<p>奧麗薇哈佛蘭……她有三年至五年的紅運、在這個期間內、她祇有一天比一天紅上去、婚事當在本年或明年上半年內、命宮屬於巨蟹星（Cancer）座、本星座內還有　姆斯賈克奈、梅兒奧白郎、桃樂絲瑙倫、白蓓　史丹妃幾位、</p>
<p>簡單些說罷、本年內能獲成功的還有雷米蘭、普麗茜拉蘭、寶蓮高黛、瑪麗　爾遜、南格萊、和南珊凱勒</p>
<p>實星方面、目下是秀蘭鄧波兒高踞着領導羣『雛』的地位、可是她是否能永還地占有這寶座呢、她的命宮和曼　璧克馥一樣、同於屬白羊星（Aries）座、而　出將和這位老牌影后一樣地終身從事於電影生活、祇有在十四歲至十七歲之間、有一個時期暫時引退、而等她第二次重回影圈內來時、仍然可以保持着一個第一流影星的地位、</p>
<p>秀蘭的最大勁敵、狄安孿生五女、將在長時期的服務影界之後、各因婚嫁而結束了藝術生活、</p>
<p>「野貓」金蕙漱將轉向播音和舞台方面、「小貴族」弗萊第白塞羅繆明年將晚離影界、待完成他的高等敎育以後、再囘好萊塢、而明年或後年、我們將不冉再看見賈克古柏的戲、長大了的賈古柏克將棄影而商了、</p>
<p>考爾鬥、從今年起、舒舒服服的一年只需拍一兩部片、同時婚姻也是極端幸福、加萊古柏不會離婚、電影生活也將繼續到幾年以後、祇有約翰巴里摩亞或者有點婚姻上的麻煩、</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥冉婚、而過去的神秘女郎嘉寶在一九三九之後將少新片攝製、</p>
<p>推測究竟是推測、「人定勝天」、「事在人爲」、未始沒有挽回天意的希望、如此一想、姑妄言之、姑妄聽之兩句、更有其必要性了、</p>

<p>本篇鉄定逢星期三日刊出、以爲風雨無改的、惟前期却因廢曆年假關係、阻了刊出期、於是本次須在下把兩個星期之球事、併在一起談談、</p>
<p>港菲埠際賽已成過去事、亦談得有點膩了、在下本不欲再加以細評、但又不得不略抒已見、憶港選隊在兩次試賽時的演出都不滿人意、然而與菲隊比賽起來、竟寫寫意意地大勝四對一、又鑒於菲隊之三戰三北及其征澳也負一對二回來、識貨者齊口合聲　、菲人足球技術水準、只可與港乙組並肩、乃又有人認爲鮑賽利、姚吉地、韋蘭　華三將甚　、假定菲隊在港參加甲組賽、亦有五名內希望的、顧此種批評，朱免自曝其評足球之幼稚相、而且女字沙石、也不像出自胞學者手筆、鮑賽利誠然是菲隊中最佳一位、爲衆目共賞之事、姚吉地也不失爲可造才、如指韋蘭奴華也好、這是上了西報「冠冕話」的大當、吾人指菲隊只有杳港　組程度、乃指全隊而言、萬不能因全隊中有兩三名能員便硬指全隊都好、今港乙組之五營炮兵，南華和米杜息、何嘗不具有甲組資格而且曾選爲重要賽代表之良村、然而苟將全隊調陞甲組、不知能達五名內否、因此例比、豈不一目瞭然、欲自詡見地高超之新學評球者亦有以明白否</p>
<p>東方最近戰勝南華華、是因「雛鳳」人脚不足、賽來遠不及東方所致、然而東方演出確巳日見進步、尤以當日的演出爲其本屆最佳鏡頭之一、所負二球、乃守門員偶失常態、致有此誤、執筆批評者自然有糾正不文舉動之天職、然而指實某某人不文、在司法森嚴之香港而有此、在下眞拜服作者的「文胆」、</p>
<p>東方巳進步多多、最可喜者爲後衛亦有顯著之進步、此後但望其橫掃直下、步步高陞、至少達到亞軍地位、爲他日出席世界遝動會預留被選基礎、</p>
<p>南華南曾以穴對零大勝香港會、而日能超拔李恩樑、用人得當、前途似錦，我爲此替南南甚抱樂觀、况新得一大無畏之張榮才把守門關、正如猛虎添冀、海電錐勇、似不必懼、語云「置之死地而後生」、在下認爲他日南南在　龍會場如能奮力打破頑旅九　會後、十九可能並勝海軍而卒獲錦標、桑榆兄因見海軍健將盡歸而先爲南南担憂、原是極有見地的話、但他忘却三月間星洲有合遠東艦隊作大操演之一事、據在下估計、南南賽海軍之期如不在操演期間舉行、則必押爲聯賽最後之一幕、地道球迷大可食個『定心丸」、</p>
<p>本星期六的足球聯賽、甲組三場俱値得注意、南華南以錦標問題重要、雖一分之微、不可　失、届時自然不會再有輕敵之演出、光華雖勇、究多南華舊人、鉻數爲有歷練之南華球員所深悉、南南當無不勝之理、東方會愈賽愈勁、對亞軍仍甚有希望、况打破九龍會在該球塲不敗之紀錄、亦爲任何一隊之職志，到時斷無放鬆半點之理、俱必有良好的演出、南華華雖無復爭標希望、然必不甘太爲落後、况有必須打倒海軍爲迺兄間接造福之責、深信針後必奮勉從事、以對位居表末的聖約瑟、勝來必綽有餘　、乙組米杜自對九營炮乒、實與乙組錦標有莫大關繫、南華如欲望染指冠軍、除望米軍勝炮兵外、更須自己一路努力、不再有所失、方能成功、</p>

<h3 id="c76">戰士的筆 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 王揚</p>
<p>在面對着血火鬥爭的偉穴時代　，再不容許那些『淸談』『帮閑』的文學存在；文學在這個時代應該担負起民族國家所課予的戰鬥的任務，戰士的筆應該像二把刀，一技手槍，直搗那那似人非人的醜類，毀滅×人，在血鬥中爭取光明的到來。其實，周作人「幽閒」『輕鬆』之結果，已够證明抗戰這時代列車是如何遺棄這種落荒倒退的人了，但還不足作前車之鑑，現在還有人高唱文學太「抗戰八般」了，『太血腥了』，一我們要寫與抗戰無關的東西』，『沖淡』的東西，這些士大夫（或者文學士大夫吧）要想一手掩蓋了目前圖爭流血的現實，完全無視同胞在×人屠殺下的抗爭，儘管他們的主觀希望僅是娛樂娛樂，供「茶餘飯後」的消遣，但客觀上，這些人也就是向×人搖頭擺尾之一類。</p>
<p>拿筆和刀槍比喩，還不十分恰當，巴比塞的『火』，雷馬克的『西線無戰事』，以及『鐵流』，『毀滅』等著作，是可以當千萬犀利的武器來刺殺×人的，就我們的抗戰說，在戰塲和後方，都配合着戰鬭現實而茁長了不少戰鬭的文學。它們雖不曾有上述著作的偉大，但一樣地作爲武器而在艱苦地向×人漢奸鬭爭，却是沒有疑義的。</p>
<p>魯迅說過：「我加人統一戰線，自然，我所使用的仍是一枝筆，所做的事仍是寫文章譯書，但等到這枝筆沒有用了，我可自已相信，用起別的武器來。』（答徐懋庸關於統一戰線）可見執筆的人，也並不永遠不會換上別的武器；只要能殺×致果，帮助革命，筆和刀槍是一樣爲戰士所持作武器的。上海北平沐猴而冠的醜類。執筆的戰士會執刀斧槍彈加以掃蕩。醉夢「昇平』的文學士大夫之流看不見這種現實，在他們的想像裏文學只能供給消遣，無怪其一嗅到文學的氣味就感血腥，要嘔吐。</p>
<p>法西斯國家是懼怕文學的，然而在展開民挨革命戰爭的中國，却需要千萬的戰士們用他們那有力而靈活的手腕和思想，創造戰鬭的文學，用以解除民族悠久的痛苦，反抗暴力的壓倒。誇耀這正義的戰鬭的現實吧，年靑的寫作者——國者呵！</p>
<p>用求生存的抗爭的筆，掃蕩×人也同時掃蕩那荒淫無恥的民族的渣滓，摧毀腐敗現像，奮力創造新生！</p>
<h3 id="c77">李廣世號飛將軍 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話——</p>
<p>前幾年故馬廉所發現的『雨窗欹枕集』裏有一篇『李廣世號飛將軍』，差不多完全根據史記卷一百九『李將軍列傳』和前漢書卷五十四式李廣蘇建傳』。這的確是很好的悲劇性的故事。李廣防禦匈奴，數奇，屢次無功；卽使有功，也只能將功折罪。他隨周亞夫平了吳楚，因爲不當背將軍印。不會得買；他大敗匈奴於沙溪，因爲觀戰的中貴被匈奴射死，又算是他的罪，只能功罪相抵：他在雁門擊匈奴，爲匈奴所得，雖曾逃出，却又被朝廷貶爲庶人：以上都是漢史中所有的。</p>
<p>小說爲了要强調其悲劇性，於是　替李廣增加了兩層波折。李廣受灞陵尉的屈辱。漢書上說是先斬後奏，漢帝嘉許，並錄有詔令的原文；小說却說李廣大敗匈奴，帝欲加官，灞陵尉家人詣闕吿廣起挾　報，無非斬尉，帝怒，將功折罪，再爲閑人。」這是其一。漢書上只說『廣軍自當，亡賞，』思意是說，李廣「爲虜所，又能勝虜，功過相當。」但小說上却說他「乘左賢王車，意圖不仁，下廷問罪』結果張騫說情，又是「將功折罪。』這是其二。</p>
<p>最後就是史漢上所說的李廣隨衛靑霍去病出擊匈奴，迷路失期，自刎而死。</p>
<p>正史上四次「數奇」，小說則增爲六次，這使我想起薛仁貴征東演義，薛仁貴功爲張士貴所奪，屈居火頭軍，也是悲劇性的，使讀者爲之憤慨，爲之不平，更增加了同情心，我又想起兪大猷，他曾屢勝倭寇，都被　文華把功勞搶去，反要將他問罪，最有名的便是岳飛被秦檜害死風波亭。</p>
<p>但是，現今却不需要這種悲劇性的故事；因爲現今是政治淸明取紀嚴肅的時代賞罰分明。只要看韓復渠和王皋南的槍斃，汪精衛的開除黨籍以及閻海文姚子靑的紀念等等，都可以看出全國團結一致，共同禦侮，李廣岳飛兪大猷的寃抑將不復見於今世了。因此，我們現在以歷史的題材來寫作章囘小說或皮黃劇，應該採取積極的題材，如『江頭碧血』之類。田漢在「抗戰與戲劇」中也曾表示過同樣的意兒，並曾在上海救亡戲劇座談會上有過同樣的表示，</p>

<h3 id="c79">諷刺藝術在日本的展開 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>就人類的文化史看　人性的流露於文藝方面，無疑是首先表現於音樂與繪畫。在造型藝術的石器時代和銅器時代出現以前，在野蠻人間已經有了最基本的音樂和輪廓式的繪書，這徵之於普通的人類歷史或考古學史，都是不移的事實。</p>
<p>人類的所以不同於其他動物，照唯物論的經濟史觀言，是人類的能製造並運用生產工具。這完全是正確的觀點。但在現象上，人類和別的動物的最顯著相　處，還是人類的擁有叫做『文化』的這一東西，這是人閒物質與精神的綜合結晶。</p>
<p>一切動物都有感情，但除人類以外，別的動物的感情流露，决不能離開其所屬的生理條件以外：馬的交頸，狗的互舐，都可說是她們的感情流露，感情表現。可是人類在這種生理的感情表現以外，更能利用第三者的物，來表現出直接生理所能解釋的感情，一切藝術的產生，我們認爲就肇因於此。</p>
<p>這物和精神結晶品的藝術，用個象徵譬喩，就是火神帕羅米修士Promethus）偷到人間來的火。這火一旦到了人間，它就永遠不熄。那怕在人類歷史上野蠻時代和黑暗時代交互迭現，但藝術這件東西，却始終循着曲線形在發展。而諷刺　術的產生，就在這曲線發展的孤形階段。</p>
<p>譬如拿現在日本情形來說，在軍人的淫威之下，日本的一切文化運動可說已全部陷於停頓。文化運動本是到達正羲的一支支流，而正義這件東西，在今日的日本『國策』之下，有如水火之不相容，所有從事正當文化活動的人，不是遭虐殺，就是被投入獄中，因此最近甚至發生了大學敎授缺貨的怪現象。他們所稱的『銃後文人』。好聽些是帮閒，老實說則就無異隨軍閥帮兇的一羣走狗。這並非是惡意的綫駡，他們的『文章』就是一個　証。</p>
<p>但正唯帕羅米修士的火種已移到了人間，所以火勢雖有一時的稍殺，但火種究竟不能熄滅。所以法西斯帝的軍閥，雖對文化各分野的活動大施壓迫，但在日本的文學上，也曾出現過石川達三的「未死的兵』那樣作品。現在石川達三雖已表示『悔改』（如一月號「中央公論」上所載的『武漢會戰』就是一例），可是民間諷剩藝術的活動，却極見活躍。尤其是針對所謂「國民動員運動」的種種卡通畫，竟能逃過檢查員的注意，登載在流行最廣的日本報紙和雜誌上。就中有幾張卡通，我們只要看一看標題，就會感到怎樣的充滿了諷刺性。譬如關於『節約』（這和中國提倡的節約，意羲不同），就有『點火同盟』，『吸烟集團』，及『垃圾國軍』等，關於代用品，就有『代用隊員』，『指甲鋼筆』，關於民間經濟動員，就有『衣櫃再編成』，『三忌日』，『實行家庭例』，『時間消費稅』等。（關於原圖，可看『雜誌』三卷五期六期六後者十六號出版的翻製版）。</p>
<p>日本的國土上雖植遍了軍事法西斯的槍林，但這種諷刺藝術，就是一枝在槍林中茁生的蔓藤，它們最初的力量雖極微弱。但一旦蔓延成長，它們就會圍住槍林，終於把這座槍林絆倒，爲正義的文化運動廓淸一條成長發展的路。</p>
<p>報載德國的戈倍爾已注意到諷刺藝術的將危害到法西斯的存在，故决定予以撲滅，但我們堅信糜非時特的魔力，畢竟是無能消除帕羅米修士的火炬的。結果一定是飛蛾撲火，自速其死而己。</p>

<p>— 杜夕慧</p>
<p>——紀南路上一個瘟疫的小鎭——</p>
<p>在旅館裏食了晚飯，疲倦地躺在床上休息一會，腦子裏彷彿有着那些恐怖之鼠子，在眼前跳動着，一條條黑死屍橫躺在前面似的樣子；這眞是可怕的陰影啊—我給這悒鬱的爬蟲在絞痛和困惑着，使我不能安心地躺下去了。我跑到窗前去　着外面那片黃昏可愛的暮色。這樣美的黃昏，我能够這樣寂寞地渡過嗎？</p>
<p>我不自覺地鎖上房門，跑出旅館定在那哲白的街上，從街口左面轉過去，便看見『安鋪中山公園』幾個大紅字。在園門柵的地方有一條石橋通到園裏去，下面流着一條淺溪，溪水在那古舊的山石罅發出淙淙的聲音。走盡石橋是一個圓水池，池中央是峻峭的生滿靑苦的假石山，在那石山上種着幾支萬年靑，大題正在那石邊緣爬行着。我從右邊的鋪道走過去，兩邊擺滿一盆盆鬱金番，風信子，金盞蘭和那美麗的蝴蝶花，一陣陣馥郁的素　和芬香的玫瑰氣息正撲進我的鼻竅。走過一帶兩傍是花床的小路的盡頭；我發見有一個幾百年前的古墓，墓傍還有一塊字蹟糢糊的碑誌。在那邊蒼鬱的松林裏還有一個落滿枯葉的網球場和一個大亭子。園裏是冷寂得像墓穴那麽陰森，沒有一個人，沒有一隻小鳥的啼聲；只有那地下蜥蜴的聲音給這悲鬱之園，給這春之黃昏奏着懷戀的小夜曲（Serenade）。</p>
<p>我幽靜地走在園裏，來回地蹈着那軟軟的小泥路，穿過那芬香的花床，望着蒼鬱的松柏和天空暮色的金黃，看着那敗破的墓穴，聽着流水淙淙底單調之昔；心裏擁賽着一種英名悲鬱的心情。慢慢地在黑暗中走出公園去。</p>
<p>走在街上彷彿定在深夜的墳墓裏一樣黑暗，兩傍房子的灰影正像晳白的墓一樣恐怖。沒有燈光，沒有人聲和狗吠；祇有夜梟一兩聲掠過繁星的蒼空的哀啼，恐怖與及一切死亡的念頭蠶食着我底心，使我不敢留戀在這街上，匆匆地走回旅店去。</p>
<p>點亮了房間的油燈，再關上房門，靜默地坐在床上，心兒還沒休止地跳動着。顫抖着。我不能說出爲了恐佈還是爲了激動旅途的疲做終於戰勝我底沉湎在憂鬱深淵裏的心，當我正出神望着那　顫動的燈光時，已在朦朧之中入夢了。</p>
<p>夜深。突然在街上飄過來幾聲密密的鎗聲。我從夢中醒過來。聽見外面正有一陣追逐和爭鬥的聲音。跟着就聽到。</p>
<p>『不得了！那人開鎗呀！……』</p>
<p>『兄弟們—追過去了！捉着那漢好……』！跟着又是一陣鎗聲。『慘呼』一聲，那逃走的人顯然是中塲倒地了。</p>
<p>『打他—打他—打漢好啊！……』</p>
<p>『啊啊啊—救命呀！……我…我不是漢奸呀！…我…我不過是走私的呀！…』</p>
<p>『丟那媽！還說不是漢奸！……』跟着又是一陣毆打和『呼痛……』的悲慘的聲音。</p>
<p>『拉他囘營部去』。一陣亂糟糟的哭罵聲和脚步混雜着。聲音越遠越模糊了。四週又囘復了死寂。</p>
<p>天未亮，那夥子便叩我的房門叫醒我了。我匆忙地起來洗了臉，穿好衣服，結了帳，那帳子又替我把皮筴托到東站去，街道還是黑漆漆的，彷彿是籠罩在瘟疫的霧靄裏一樣。東站上正擁滿一羣趕路的旅客，那夥子替我擠進去買了蔡，又替我把行李送進車廂的行李房。我賞了他兩隻角子，他說聲『多謝』：便一溜聲煙的跑去了。</p>
<p>天正露出最初一綫曙光時，我們的車子便駛出安舖軍站，同着那迢迢的南路前進了。我囘望到鎭上還躺在一陳碧靑的晨霧。『再會—瘟疫的鎭啊！』我帶着一顆逃脫似的心情在默禱着。</p>
<p>今日的安鋪正是×人企圖登陸的地方，我祈望這鎭上的瘟痠能够賜給那貧婪的皇軍的一件登陸的體物！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Congratulations on the Opening of the National Education Conference <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The National Education Conference is scheduled to open today in Chongqing. Many leading figures from the Hong Kong and Macau education sectors have also traveled to participate. At this crucial time when the War of Resistance is transitioning from its first to its second stage, we must express our sincere expectations and best wishes for this conference, which is of great importance to educating the people and cultivating thousands of capable individuals to complete the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. We respectfully offer our humble suggestions for consideration by the attendees and the national education community.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the all-out War of Resistance, our country's education system has begun a dramatic transformation, especially in the education within the northwestern war zones, which has started to progress at an accelerated pace. However, generally speaking, there is still no comprehensive systemic improvement that meets the needs of the War of Resistance. This is a regrettable matter for advancing the all-out War of Resistance and building a republic based on the Three Principles of the People. We should focus our efforts on this today. Not long ago, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party passed a resolution to "implement an educational policy for the War of Resistance, making education serve the long-term war." Education experts such as Mr. Tao Xingzhi have also loudly advocated for "implementing comprehensive education to support comprehensive resistance." Subsequently, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the recent Third National Political Council have made crucial resolutions regarding the improvement of education. We hope that this National Education Conference can, based on these calls and resolutions, and in light of the development of the War of Resistance and the needs of the country's future, determine the overall improvement of education. At the same time, we hope that the national education community will follow the fundamental principles of the above calls and resolutions, and proactively implement them according to the needs of the War of Resistance and the actual conditions of various regions. This is one point.</p>
<p>Among the resolutions regarding the improvement of national education passed by the recently concluded Third National Political Council are: the proposal by Liu Hengjing and 22 others that "Central government funding for compulsory education should be doubled year by year according to the original plan, in order to promote compulsory education in war zones and rear provinces"; "increasing the budget for general education and culture in the next fiscal year to actively promote national education among youth"; the proposal by Hu Shiqing and 27 others that "the government should allocate special funds to organize and expand specialized education in order to enhance educational effectiveness and increase the strength of the War of Resistance"; the proposal by Chen Shi and 21 others to urgently rescue the youth in the occupied territories from being exploited; the proposal by Luo Heng and 23 others to "cultivate talent for border affairs to strengthen national defense"; the proposal by Ma Liang and 20 others to "promote emotional understanding among various ethnic groups, build special education for Mongolians, Hui people, and Tibetans, and train a large number of people in the interior who are proficient in the languages and scripts of various ethnic groups"; the proposal by Zou Taofen and 43 others to "mobilize intellectuals across the country to eliminate illiteracy and popularize public awareness to benefit the War of Resistance and national reconstruction," and so on. All of these are important resolutions that meet the current needs of the War of Resistance. The National Education Conference must refer to these resolutions and stipulate specific implementation measures. At the same time, we hope that all overseas Chinese education communities will enthusiastically support them, striving for their realization in the shortest possible time. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the overall educational policy for the War of Resistance, in our view, the most important aspects are: (1) the revision of the education system; (2) the strengthening and expansion of organizations; and (3) the promotion of specialized education. First, concerning the revision of the education system, the main point should be to abolish unnecessary and non-urgent courses from the past, reform unreasonable school management systems, so as to teach new courses needed during the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and at the same time pay attention to fostering students' initiative in learning. Second, regarding the strengthening and expansion of organizations, the main focus is on strengthening and expanding educational organizations in the occupied territories and rear provinces. At the same time, it is especially important to accelerate the establishment and expansion of a national anti-Japanese national united front within the education community, and the overseas Chinese education community should become one of the fundamental units of this united front. Finally, regarding the promotion of specialized education, the main points should be the following three: First, it is necessary to establish, expand, and strengthen various cadre schools to quickly train a large number of young cadres for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Second, it is necessary to widely develop mass education, organize various supplementary schools, promote the national literacy movement, drama movement, singing movement, and sports movement, and at the same time, quickly establish more popular local newspapers from before and after the war to improve the national culture and national awareness of the general public. Third, it is necessary to widely and actively promote compulsory primary education, promote the spirit of the Chinese nation, and cultivate a new generation to build a new China with a democratic republic, in order to realize the ideal of a thorough Three Principles of the People state! We hope that the National Education Conference and the domestic and international education communities will pay special attention to these three points. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The above three points are the basic principles and main measures for improving national education based on the new needs of the current new stage of the War of Resistance. We believe that the National Education Conference will have more satisfactory resolutions. We respectfully extend our regards to all attendees, and especially hope that the national education community will actively rise up and prepare to strive to complete the new tasks.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Tian Han Speaks Freely About Drama and Other Matters <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the good fortune of travel: In just one or two days in Changsha, I was fortunate enough to appreciate the art blooming from the scorched earth—the revolutionary playwright Mr. Tian Han's improvised performance of a reformed Hunan opera on a commemorative day!</p>
<p>The time was from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and the location was the Yin Gong Movie Theater. This theater can be considered the only surviving art palace after the Changsha fire: a new-style building, grand in scale, with the audience quickly filling every seat and even standing. It could probably hold two or three thousand people. I heard about it and went, but it was already packed, and a "Full" sign was hung high at the entrance because it was a free public performance for the masses.</p>
<p>There were four plays on the program, and I only saw the final act of Mr. Tian's reformed "Bie Mi Cong Jun" (Farewell, Secretly Join the Army) and the complete play of Hunan opera "Cai Wenji Joins the Army in Place of Her Husband." Most of the actors were fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls, and their costumes, performances, and play lyrics each had their own special touching qualities.</p>
<p>Mr. Tian and the famous film director Mr. Hong Shen were both sitting among the audience. At that time, thanks to a very enthusiastic female attendant, who shot me through the audience like an arrow, I was able to find them: Mr. Tian was wearing a grass-green military cap and a short, fur-collared leather coat, sitting upright and looking up, resembling a short, energetic commanding officer; Mr. Hong was sitting in the row behind him, also fully armed, with a robust physique and a dignified demeanor, completely different from his pre-war film director posture.</p>
<p>I personally have this concept: China has elevated its international status through the War of Resistance, and each individual also seems to have become great by participating in the War of Resistance. Perhaps because national character and personal character can both hold their heads high! At the same time, "When trimming flowers by the water, one must be intentional, always treat one branch as two," I think the two gentlemen, Tian and Hong, were not simply watching the play for the sake of watching the play; they were obviously putting a lot of thought into it, so they watched with extraordinary concentration.</p>
<p>Afraid of disturbing others, I only exchanged a glance with them when we first met, and then squeezed into a seat near Mr. Tian. At that time, the play was at its climax, and the audience was listening intently to the lyrics on stage. Mr. Tian softly asked me, "Have you ever seen Hunan Gaoqiang opera?" I said, "No." He smiled and glanced at the stage: "This is Hunan Gaoqiang opera!" Which made me a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>In my opinion—as a layman—local operas from other provinces, like Sichuan opera, often involve Gaoqiang singing. About six or seven out of ten plays involve Gaoqiang singing. Guizhou opera also includes some, but their tones are more sonorous and unrestrained, slightly different from the sharp and delicate Hunan opera. Mr. Tian's evaluation of Hunan opera's Gaoqiang singing is that it has a very high level and is a precious treasure of Chinese opera. Of course, he has his own unique insights.</p>
<p>Mr. Tian also talked a little about the comparison between Hunan opera and Peking opera. He said: The strengths of Hunan opera mostly lie in emotional dramas. It is genuine, passionate, delicate, simple, and graceful. In short, its spirit and overall appearance are like orchids in a secluded valley, with a uniquely charming style. The strength of Peking opera is its specialization in beauty, with a high degree of beautification, especially the superb skills and tense scenes of martial arts plays, which Hunan opera cannot match. The Chinese opera most famous abroad is not literary drama but martial arts drama. Hunan opera should learn from Peking opera to remedy its shortcomings in martial arts plays. In short, if actors from both Peking and Hunan operas can learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, they will definitely open up a new situation in the opera world.</p>
<p>No matter how high the level of any science, culture, or art, it is impossible to determine that it has reached the highest and most supreme peak. Mr. Tian hopes that the opera world will not have sectarian views and be stuck in its own ways. I think this view is very correct. Fortunately, dozens of actors from the Peking and Hunan opera troupes, under his leadership, are learning from each other, and it is expected that satisfactory results will be achieved soon, making the achievements of the two operas even more refined.</p>
<p>After the last play ended that night, Mr. Hong, having just returned from the Nanchang front lines, wanted to go back to the hotel to rest, but I went to Mr. Tian's residence—the Department of Finance—with him, and we continued our discussion in loud voices for more than an hour. From the time he left Shanghai, we talked about the drama promotion work he is currently promoting, and finally, he personally discussed his outlook on life, with insightful observations on the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Tian left Shanghai and came to the mainland on the day Shanghai fell in November two years ago. He said: When he passed through Nanjing, people were moving in a chaotic mess; civil servants were especially shaken. Among the many people he saw, only Ye Jianying maintained an optimistic attitude. Now that the War of Resistance has entered its second stage, people who are pessimistic are as numerous as stars in the sky, adding brilliance to each other, which is an unexpectedly good phenomenon.</p>
<p>After leaving Nanjing and returning to Hunan (he is from Xiangtan), he passed through Nanchang, and unfortunately the car overturned into the water, and almost everyone in the car was drowned. After arriving in Changsha, he borrowed 150 yuan from a friend and founded the "Anti-Japanese War Daily" on the anniversary of the January 28th Incident last year. On April 1st, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission was established in Wuhan, and Mr. Guo Moruo invited him to serve as the director of the Sixth Division of the Third Department, responsible for drama promotion. Mr. Hong Shen was appointed as the section chief in the same division, assisting in all aspects.</p>
<p>He said: The most interesting thing when working in Wuhan was holding the "Water Torch Parade"; from the Yellow Crane Tower on the river surface to the downstream of Hankou, one could see thousands of torches illuminating the river water into a bright and dazzling golden belt. In addition, there were hundreds of anti-Japanese war art propaganda paintings, which were illuminated by electric lights, revealing a beautiful and meaningful scene. He wrote a poem at the time to commemorate the unprecedented spectacle:</p>
<p>Before the sea of people and the magnificent pavilion,</p>
<p>Songs and electric torches rise from the楼船boats,</p>
<p>The old man by the river asks in a low voice,</p>
<p>How does this grand scene compare to the Northern Expedition years?</p>
<p>At the time when the anti-Japanese sentiment was at its highest, a group of artists collectively created a great anti-Japanese painting on the Yellow Crane Tower, extremely huge, as long as fifteen zhang, even painting the entire city wall into a picture, with 30,000 characters in it, all with vivid and profound expressions. If this painting is not destroyed by the invaders, it can be passed down to future generations after the lost land is recovered and embellishments are added.</p>
<p>After he went to work in the Third Department, he compiled ten anti-Japanese performing arts teams and two children's theater groups, each team (group) with about thirty or forty people; and he opened a "Wartime Training Class for Opera Actors Remaining in Wuhan," including Peking opera, Han opera, various operas, acrobatics, variety performances, etc., with more than 700 students. The training lasted for more than a month, and the cost of books, diplomas, and other expenses was only 200 yuan.</p>
<p>However, once, when he solicited donations from the students for winter clothes for the front lines, he immediately received more than 1,400 yuan. One person—not even a famous actor—generously donated 120 yuan alone, which made the principal (Tian concurrently) very embarrassed and had no choice but to donate a sum equal to the amount. Many actresses took off their gold-filled teeth, and especially took off their woolen sweaters, piling them into a small mountain. They are so enthusiastic—whoever sees them will be happy! At the same time, the school also invited Mr. Chen Cheng, Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Chen Lifu, Lu Diheng, and other gentlemen to give lectures, so that they could hear some advanced theories and see the demeanor of celebrities, and they also expressed their warm welcome!</p>
<p>Mr. Tian couldn't help but become excited when he talked about this. The scene of him and the elite students of the pear garden gathering together in a relaxed and elegant atmosphere is not difficult for us to imagine in this remaining afterglow.</p>
<p>About 6,000 outstanding students of the pear garden and new drama performance experts from various teams (groups) have emerged from under the hand of this master of salvation opera, and all are under the control of the Political Department. However, due to the nature of their profession, as long as the plot of the dramas performed by old opera actors does not violate the outline of anti-Japanese propaganda, then all performance activities can develop freely. As for new opera actors, that is, various anti-Japanese performing arts teams and children's theater groups, they are all directly commanded by the Political Department and are currently working separately in Nanchang, Pingjiang, Shashi, Guilin, Hengyang, Guiyang, and other places, but they are not fixed in one place but have mobility. The expenses of the teams are paid by the department, with each team member receiving a subsidy of about 25 yuan per month. In addition, the entire team receives a certain amount of office expenses. The young men and women who are generally engaged in work have a very difficult life; but their purpose is to save the country, and their spirit is extremely high and comforting.</p>
<p>After the Changsha fire, a group of Peking opera actors who had retreated here from Hankou, their gongs and drums silent, had no choice but to find their grand master—Mr. Tian—to ask to follow him and seek further progress. Mr. Tian, with a sense of duty, invited them all, including their families, to live in the Department of Finance, where they did not have to pay rent; however, they had to abide by three rules: First, break the boundaries between Peking opera and local opera (that is, Hunan opera), and study and learn from each other with the original local opera actors, each absorbing the advantages of the other, in order to realize the new situation in the opera world that he wants to create in his ideal. Second, break the class system of actors, so that the status of famous actors and ordinary actors is equally equal. Third, break the old custom of one person singing opera and the whole family eating, and all old opera actors who are willing to join the new era opera team, their family members, regardless of women and children, must each take up a performing position. As a result, they all fully accepted and implemented it, so the results are remarkable and considerable. I think that among these three measures, the second and third have revolutionary significance and are especially worthy of universal promotion.</p>
<p>He was originally a celebrity who advocated and wrote new dramas, but he objectively said: Old opera gave him an inspiration, and its effectiveness is even greater than new drama. Most people over middle age are accustomed to traditional opera; and the number of old opera actors in each center is also very considerable. If there are full preparations in advance, coupled with strict organization and training, and new blood is instilled in the required scripts and materials, won't they become excellent and readily available propaganda tools? It is a pity that the slogan of reforming old operas has been loudly chanted for more than ten years, but in reality, very few playwrights can truly work in this direction, and the production of scripts using the "old bottle filled with new wine" method is even as rare as a phoenix feather or unicorn horn! Mr. Tian, when talking about the problem of "script shortage," also expressed his deep apologies, regretting that he could not immediately "hang up his military hat" and return to his writing career.</p>
<p>Naturally, although he is now bearing the "rank of general," he has not completely broken away from his writing career in practice. The Anti-Japanese War Daily, which he had previously founded by borrowing money from a friend, has been relocated to Yuanling and republished, with more than 500,000 fonts cast, which is a cultural foundation that he is currently supporting. Here, after the fire, another small "New Changsha News" was started, but because there are other large newspapers and paper is in short supply, it was recently planned to stop publication. But thinking about the 60 or 70 small newspaper vendors who were dedicated to the war, and whose lives could not be solved, I had no choice but to make things difficult for them. Still struggling to publish. These small newspaper vendors were all homeless children on the streets of 11 or 12 years old who were recruited and trained by the newspaper. In their spare time, they were also taught to sing and perform, and their talents were no less than those of children's theater groups.</p>
<p>Regarding this, I don't admire Mr. Tian's benevolent heart and his actions as a philanthropist, but I admire his spirit of "teaching without discrimination" and his practical verification that these pitiful children abandoned by society also have certain talents. If they received the same education as the privileged children of wealthy families, with the spirit of hard work and striving for progress that they have cultivated in their special environment, the so-called "unintentional planting of willows yields shade," their achievements would probably be much greater than those of other fortunate children. Therefore, I sincerely hope that those who are engaged in wartime children's relief work should not only focus on the rescue of children in the war zone with registered families, but should also shift their eyes to the street children in various places in front of them, so that they can be bathed in the social grace and avoid the regret of leaving out gems.</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Tian's explosive speech style lightly blew from the colorful opera world to the quiet and beautiful field of music. He himself has a high interest in music, and he especially praises the works of famous composers Nie Er, Zhang Shu, and Xian Xinghai. After a while, he bowed his head and slowed down his tone, saying: He cried once when he first heard the news of Nie Er's death in Nanjing prison; recently, Zhang Shu was unfortunately bombed to death by the enemy in Guilin, which made him feel uncomfortable for several days. Because Zhang Shu often worked with him when he was nineteen years old, and he also benefited from him and suffered losses from him, and they had been in prison together in Nanjing. Although Zhang Shu was poor, he could work hard; although he was straightforward, he could be knowledgeable and remember well, especially with a talent for composing. The anti-Japanese war songs he painstakingly created were numerous and widely sung for a time. Now, unfortunately, he died in a flying disaster with his beloved daughter, which is not only a great loss to the art world! The tone of his speech had become so gentle that it could no longer be more gentle. I instinctively glanced at his face, and it turned out that he was already in tears—at that time, the candlelight was flickering, and the scene felt even more desolate; our conversation also stopped invisibly. At that time, I secretly thought: Mr. Tian's character is known to be not only a tough revolutionary playwright, but also a good and emotional gentleman! But in an instant, there was a kind of light whisper that seemed to be blowing from an empty valley, calling me back from the humorous and solemn realm to listen again. .</p>
<p>"I feel that a person's life is very limited, especially during this war," Mr. Tian said coldly; but the atmosphere was still quite serious: "We should try to seize the time as much as possible, so that we can quickly do some beneficial and meaningful things for the country, the people, and the community! I personally find it difficult to deal with the social obligations involved in most work, especially being an official. People like us are really not up to it. I was already bored after less than a year in the Political Department. What suits me is still holding a pen, so I have already sent a telegram to resign." Judging from this, Mr. Tian really wants to retire from his official post.</p>
<p>"I have never been pessimistic about doing things, and I often accomplish what I want to do." He continued, picking up his spirits: "At the same time, life force cannot be wasted. Being a small official may not benefit the country, but it will greatly harm myself. I will resign and go to the Yuanling Anti-Japanese War Daily to hold a pen and write more pamphlets that contribute more to the country and society than being an official!" His conversation ended here.</p>
<p>But we must remember: A person's life is limited, and we should take the opportunity to do beneficial things for the country and society, especially in this great era when the nation and the people are fighting to the death with violence, we should contribute our strengths to the country as much as possible, so as to avoid wasting personal time and causing harm to the nation!</p>

<h3 id="e4">Fierce Battles Along the Xiang River Bank; Enemy Attempts to Breach the Xiangsha Connection; Enemy Morale in Yuekou Area Dwindling <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, February 28th] Although the enemy is now claiming they will invade the Southwest and Northwest, according to military assessments, a major war is unlikely to break out in the short term. The enemy is currently focusing on clearing out our guerrilla units north of the Yellow River. They have two divisions in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, two divisions between the western section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Tongpu Railway, and two divisions in Shandong, along with one garrison brigade. We have increased our troop strength in each of these areas sufficiently to crush their ambitions. In Chahar and Suiyuan, there are still two divisions in total, with no recent increases. The enemy's 21st Division has recently moved to the Kaifeng area, attempting to attack our guerrilla forces nearby. The situation in western Shanxi and southern China is quiet. The enemy is increasing its forces towards Jiujiang, seemingly with new intentions. This is because our security forces on Hainan Island continue to resist. The enemy does indeed have a total of one division on Hainan Island, consisting of one regiment from the 5th Division (most of the division is in Shandong), the Taiwan Army's Hotta Regiment, and three battalions of naval infantry. The enemy has not increased their forces much in Hubei. Recent incursions into the west are still limited to local engagements.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, February 28th] According to Chinese sources, the enemy recently launched an aggressive westward offensive from Wuhan, with the apparent goal of capturing Jingmen, south of Anlu. It is reported that Japanese troops occupied Jingmen last night. Jingmen is located between Shashi and Xiangyang. This move by the Japanese aims to cut off the connection between Shashi and Xiangyang and sever the transportation routes between Henan and Changsha. The Japanese are also attempting to advance westward and seize the key Yangtze River points of Yichang and Shashi. Because the Japanese have occupied Yichang, it can be used as an air base to bomb Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming. The evacuation of families is limited to ten days and the city is actively preparing for all fire prevention and rescue equipment in case of Japanese air raids.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, February 28th] The war situation in central Hubei was relatively quiet today. The enemy forces that invaded Yuekou attempted to cross the Xiang River three times but were repelled by our troops. They are now rushing to build fortifications and defend their position. Our forces on the Hanyi Road are attacking and advancing towards the enemy in Wamiaoji. The enemy occupying Sanyangdian suffered over a thousand casualties. After a fierce counterattack by our powerful forces, they are showing signs of collapse. There are over a thousand enemy troops north of the Xi River, operating in the Xujiaan and Yujiaan areas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yichang, February 27th] The morale of the enemy on all fronts in central Hubei has been dwindling after being met with separate attacks by our forces in recent days. On the Jingzhong Road, our forces are facing off against the enemy near Shilipu. The enemy in Yuekou is rushing to build fortifications and defend their position, with no further ability to advance. In the Sanyangdian area, after several days of bloody fighting, the enemy has made no progress. The enemy is focusing its efforts on fiercely attacking our forces on the front of the highway. Our officers and soldiers are resisting heroically, fighting to the death. A fierce battle is currently underway at Yanmen Pass.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chang'an City Office, February 28th] On the 20th, the enemy at Muluan Township advanced northeast but was ambushed by our forces, resulting in over twenty enemy deaths. The enemy then fled back.</p>
<p>[Minkuo News Agency, February 28th] There are two enemy field guns stationed inside Yongji City, and two hundred enemy troops in Nanyang Village. They have been harassing the area daily, looting over a thousand head of livestock and household items such as reed mats and dishes from the people. Wherever they go, they force the people to hang the Japanese flag, or else the entire village will be punished. On the 18th and 19th, over 1,400 enemy troops from Linfen moved to Hongdong Zhaoyu, stationed near the city. On the 21st, a unit of over 300 enemy troops from Zhaocheng operated in the Yuanchuan (southeast of the city) area, severely harassing the people along the way. Enemy military transport is very busy between Fencheng and Shicun. Our forces are constantly attacking them, with considerable gains, it is said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, February 28th] A traveler returning from Baoding said that Chinese guerrillas had destroyed the depot a few miles north of Baoding and had also destroyed part of a freight train. The guerrillas then attacked the freight train again, destroying 200 yards of the railway track, greatly hindering transportation, it is said.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, February 27th] The enemy forces invading Huaihai have now increased to three regiments, namely the Horikawa 32nd Regiment, the Rikuno 33rd Regiment, and the Yanagita 95th Regiment, equipped with five aircraft and over 20 tanks. They are attacking Shiyang along one route, invading Huaiyin along another, and advancing towards the East Sea along a third. Large-scale and fierce battles have been unfolding daily between the Zheng-Hai Highway's Riji-Hanji area and the Yanghe-Yangjing-Daxing area. The 26th and 27th were particularly intense. Our heroic soldiers on all fronts are resisting step by step, fighting bitterly for three days and nights, yet remain extremely excited. Clear sounds of artillery fire can be heard in Huaiyin these days. At noon on the 27th, five enemy aircraft bombed Heyang County. Enemy forces in southern Shandong also invaded Ganyu on the 26th, dividing into three routes, one from Huandun, one from Tuowang, and one from Heilin. County Magistrate Zhu Aizhou led troops to block them, and the fighting was also fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuzhou, February 27th] The enemy invasion of Hainan Island has encountered strong resistance from our local forces, resulting in extremely heavy casualties. They are now redeploying troops from Taiwan to reinforce them. The enemy troops besieging Weizhou Island are forcing the island's people to obtain "obedient citizen certificates."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, February 27th] Seven people, including Ruan Muhuan, a famous professor from Peiping and the political director of the Suiyuan local army, and Zheng Lian, the army's secretary, were rumored to have been killed last December during the reorganization of puppet troops. Reliable sources now confirm that Ruan and Zheng have turned danger into safety and have safely arrived in central Hebei. Previously, the puppet troops in Gengzhuang, Dongshan, Fengzhen, and other places indicated to Ruan and others their intention to defect. Ruan, knowing that these puppet troops were from the forces of ××× and others, initially did not suspect anything. He and Zheng Lian, along with five attendants, lightly equipped, went to the puppet troops' station to give a speech on the reorganization. Unexpectedly, the puppet troops detained all of them and forcibly confiscated the firearms of a certain detachment under Ruan's command. This matter was discovered by the enemy side, who immediately demanded Ruan and Zheng. The puppet troops could not bear to harm them, so they killed two attendants in their place. Thereupon, Ruan and Zheng were released, disguised themselves, arrived in Tianjin, and detoured back to central Hebei. They recently sent a telegram to a friend in the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi border region, reporting the details of their escape.</p>

<p>——Part Three of the March Political Report——</p>
<p>At the local level, the main focus is on strengthening political institutions below the provincial level. Our country's politics, at the central and local levels, were originally a unified institution. Whether it was a county, prefecture, district, or province, they were all areas divided for administrative convenience. The provincial government is an agency connecting the top and bottom. In reality, the provincial chairman is an official who executes central decrees, promotes central virtues, soothes the people within the province, and represents the central government in supervising local politics. As for the war zones, because transportation is mostly cut off by the enemy, the administrative inspectorates must be re-divided based on national defense, transportation, and economic conditions. It must be determined that the commissioners do not concurrently serve as county magistrates, and the organization of the commissioners' offices must be strengthened to ensure that the commissioners fulfill their responsibility to direct local administrative agencies. The county magistrate is an official close to the people. In the second phase of the war of resistance, we must select, examine, train, and appoint qualified and capable personnel to serve as county magistrates, guaranteeing their tenure so that they can go ahead and do it. Because the power exerted by a good county magistrate is greater than that of a division of troops. Counties with a population of over 500,000 should be changed to special-grade counties, and the county magistrates should be treated as appointed officials. This is a key point of the second phase of the wartime domestic policy plan. Regarding military affairs, I only need to say one sentence now, which is that our current combat strength, whether in spirit or in material terms, is far superior to what it was before the July 7th Incident. Now I should briefly explain the administrative situation in the war provinces.</p>
<p>Administration in Guerrilla Areas</p>
<p>We usually like to use the term "occupied area," but in fact, this term is extremely inappropriate and can easily cause misunderstandings both domestically and internationally. The places where the enemy troops arrive are all war zones, whether it is positional warfare or mobile warfare. We are now trying to examine the administrative conditions of eleven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi. These eleven provinces have a total of 941 counties, of which 583 counties have their county boundaries intact, and the county magistrates are still stationed in the county seat and are working as usual. This type of county accounts for 62% of the total. Secondly, in 35 counties, the county magistrates are still working in the county seat, but part of the county has been temporarily occupied by the enemy. There are also 245 counties where the county seat has been occupied by the enemy, but the county magistrate can still exercise his powers in the countryside. This type accounts for 26% of the total. There are also 23 county magistrates who have moved to neighboring counties, but they have not lost the ability to exercise their powers, and their orders can still reach their county. Finally, there are 55 counties that have been completely occupied by the enemy, and the county magistrates' powers cannot be exercised for the time being. This type accounts for only 6% of the total, and of these 55 counties, 42 are in Hebei Province, and of these 42 counties, 22 are within the "Jidong Special Zone" organized by the traitor Yin Rugeng before the July 7th Incident. After a year and a half of bloody battles, the new places occupied by the enemy, apart from cities such as Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, are only 33 counties. In these cities and counties, our guerrillas still frequently give the enemy all kinds of unexpected threats and attacks. You can see how insignificant the enemy's political gains are.</p>
<p>Establishment of the War Zone Party-Government Committee</p>
<p>The administrative adjustment in this vast war zone is a very complex issue, and its importance is no less than that of reorganizing the army. The government's adjustment plan is to divide the war zone into two parts, one part that we can call the front-line area, and another part that we can call the secondary front-line area. In order for the central government to closely link the party, government, and military agencies in the front-line area, enhance efficiency, strengthen institutions, and employ talented people to adapt to the wartime system, a War Zone Party-Government Committee has been established to unify orders and coordinate steps. We believe that in the future, we will be able to give the enemy even greater blows from their rear. Within the secondary front-line area, we also have various measures that are tailored to the time and place. In some places, we increase the powers of the county magistrate or commissioner, allowing them to act on their own and resist independently. In other places, if several administrative inspectorates are too far away from the provincial government seat and transportation is often disrupted by the enemy, the Executive Yuan should approve the establishment of an administrative office (or office) at the request of the provincial government. These measures are all to adapt to special circumstances. In addition to the above, there are several noteworthy matters in domestic policy work.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Military Service Law</p>
<p>The implementation of the military service law was originally a pioneering effort in our country, and it has encountered considerable difficulties in the past, as you all know well. The basic conditions for implementing military service must be to raise the anti-war sentiment of the people across the country and to strengthen the administrative institutions at the grassroots level so that joining the army becomes a social trend, which can then proceed smoothly and without hindrance. These two necessary conditions have taken decades of effort to achieve in other countries. The government's improvements to the implementation of the military service law include increasing the treatment of draftees, sincerely treating the families of soldiers on expedition, intensifying military service propaganda, and improving the baojia system. If one-twentieth of our country's 450 million people were to serve in the military, we could mobilize 22.5 million people. Compared to the 3 million people mobilized by the enemy country, seven Chinese soldiers can fight one Japanese soldier. How can there be any concern that we cannot drive the enemy out of the country?</p>
<p>Improving the Baojia System</p>
<p>In recent years, although a few people have criticized our country's current baojia system from a theoretical point of view, regardless of the right and wrong in this, we will not discuss it for the time being. If we did not have the baojia system, military service would simply be impossible to carry out. The shortcomings of the baojia system should, of course, be improved. The government has decided to start by raising the treatment of baojia chiefs and carefully selecting baojia talents. Concrete plans have been announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is currently planning a training program for baojia chiefs to strengthen the baojia system. We hope that all provinces will follow suit as soon as possible. (End of part, to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Peace Conference: British Prime Minister Has No Intention of Convening <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th] Prime Minister Chamberlain formally announced in the House of Commons that the British government had recognized the Franco government. When a certain member of parliament asked whether the government would convene a world peace conference, Chamberlain replied that the government believed that the first step toward lasting peace should be to limit armaments and remove restrictions on international trade. Preliminary preparations should be made before convening a world peace conference. Now is not the time to convene such a conference; even if it were convened, it would be ineffective. When the time comes to convene a peace conference that can be effective, his party will come forward to convene it.</p>
<h3 id="e29">×The Implementation of a Poisoning Policy in Western Shanghai×Special Service Department Supplies Narcotics in Large Quantities in an Attempt to Collect Funds to Cover Military Expenses <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] According to the North-China Daily News, crimes and assassinations are rampant in the western district of Shanghai, and the most insidious threat among them is opium. There is a risk that all the people in the area will be corrupted. With the permission and assistance of the Japanese authorities, opium is transported to earth shops openly operating in the area. Although the Public Works Department has protested and foreign residents outside the West District Concession roads have also voiced complaints, the authorities outside the concession have ignored this and have been able to rapidly implement their plan. Today, the situation in that area can only be described as "horrifying." The drug trade far outweighs other serious threats. Opium and other drugs can be legally sold in all areas ruled by the Japanese, and the steps toward corruption have already begun in Shanghai. The authorities collect money from the earth shops and reap huge profits. According to investigations, as early as January of last year, there was an attempt to establish earth shops in the western district, but these plans were not realized until the end of November. Eleven earth shops were established. The reason for the delay in the formal opening of the earth shops was that the Japanese wanted the owners of the earth shops to first pay a "deposit" of 3,000 yuan per year. Although the owners of the earth shops were unable to pay, to this day, as many as thirty-four earth shops are known to exist in the western district, all of which are highly profitable. It is expected that there will be more establishments established in the future, because in this trade, both the earth shop owners and the Japanese can greatly benefit. The earth shop owners must pay 1,000 yuan per month to the local ruler, but because the amount was too large, it was reduced to 500 yuan before they could operate. This opium is transported in large quantities from Hongkou by the Japanese Army Special Service Department and supplied to the earth shops. In mid-February of last year, the Earth Shop Association was established on Brenan Road, and the earth shop owners all joined the association as members. The association then moved to Jessfield Road. The authorities obtained huge amounts of revenue from the members of the association and used it to pay for military expenses. Therefore, they refused to transfer the earth shops in the area to the control of the "Reformed Government." In addition to the earth shops and gambling dens, a heroin smuggling center, under the fictitious name of Taichang (transliteration) Tobacco Exemption Store, was set up last month at No. 477 Robison Road, at the corner of Lou Lan Road. The operators seemed to be three Koreans, with some gangsters from the western district as the drug dealers. In January of this year, the Japanese authorities established the "Opium Smuggling Prevention Group" in the Jessfield Road area, presided over by Mr. Qi, the Japanese advisor to the "Shanghai Municipal Government," with an office at No. 21, Lane 61, Cayanna Road. The group is divided into two departments, one handling smuggling cases involving Japanese and Koreans, and the other handling cases involving Chinese. The funds for the group are obtained from the money collected from the earth shops. The fields and gardens are beyond question. At the end of last year, the "General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium" was established, with an office on the sixth floor of the Broadway Mansion, aiming to implement an opium monopoly plan in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The details of this group's actions are not yet known, but its establishment is undoubtedly intended to collect funds to pay for military expenses. In early August of last year, it was decided to establish an "Opium Monopoly Bureau" in western Shanghai, so it was planned to lease three houses at Nos. 6, 7, and 70, Lane 538, Connaught Road, as warehouses for storing large quantities of opium, but as far as is known, this proposed "bureau" has not yet started operations.</p>

<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>× The Japanese are currently increasing their troops on the Nanxun Line, attempting to capture Nanchang and cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, blocking Zhejiang Province's rear lines. On the other hand, they are using × battleships to harass the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province,妄想to encircle the greater Zhejiang region. But Zhejiang is already prepared. Wen Zhong once said to Goujian: "There are nine strategies for avenging grievances and destroying enemies." His eighth strategy is "enriching the country and preparing sharp weapons," and the ninth strategy is "using armor to承其弊." He also said: "Judging things means we can fight; judging things means discerning right from wrong. If right and wrong are clearly understood, no one can deceive us." Fan Li also said: "If prepared, we can fight: if we are careful and守慎, we can wait for the unexpected; if we are prepared and守固, we can surely respond to difficulties." Greater Zhejiang is indeed only waiting for the opportunity. Before King Yue attacked Wu, he assembled his troops and列士, gave a great exhortation to the people, and vowed: "I have heard that the wise rulers of ancient times did not worry that their numbers were insufficient, but worried that their people had too little shame. Now Fuchai has 130,000 men dressed in rhino-hide armor, not worrying that their aspirations and actions have too little shame, but worrying that their numbers are insufficient..." This Fuchai is a portrayal of our current ×Japanese fascist military閥. We don't need to spend ten years gathering and ten years educating like Goujian before we can destroy the enemy. We only need to step up our rebuilding and education, constantly rebuilding and educating. In three years at the shortest, and five years at the longest, the people of the whole country will surely be like the people of Yue, with "fathers encouraging their sons and brothers urging their younger brothers, saying: 'Wu can be伐也!'" At that time, the 25 million people of greater Zhejiang will surely be a strong pioneer for the 450 million people to挞伐. (2.18)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Britain Recognizes Franco, Heated Debate in the House of Commons, Labor Party Proposes Censure of the Current Government, French Foreign Ministry Also Announces Recognition <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British government recognized the Spanish Franco government, stating that the government had given extremely慎 consideration to the situation in Spain. Since the fall of Barcelona and Catalonia, Franco now controls most of Spain's land, industrial centers, and production areas, much of which is in his grasp. Even if the government forces in the south can continue to resist, the outcome is now obvious. Prolonging the resistance will only increase the suffering and loss of life of the people. It seems that we can no longer recognize the涣散 original government as a government exercising sovereignty. Franco has publicly stated that he personally and his government are determined to maintain Spain's inherent independence and that only criminals should be tried according to伕. The government expresses its satisfaction with this. Chamberlain also said that the British government's recognition was unconditional. The government has also announced today its decision to recognize the Franco government. The House of Commons will hold a debate on this issue when it meets tomorrow. After Chamberlain announced the recognition, the opposition party responded with cries of "shameless," while the government faction cheered. The Labor Party decided to propose a motion to censure the government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] In the British House of Commons today, Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement that Britain recognized the Franco government caused an uproar. Attlee, the leader of the Labor Party's anti-government faction, said that the Prime Minister had stated last Thursday that there could be no further remarks on the issue of recognizing the 西叛 government. Why is he now announcing recognition? Chamberlain replied that the government had decided to entrust the final decision on this recognition issue to the Foreign Secretary and himself, and said that this move was decided last weekend. Attlee further asked when the decision was made. Chamberlain replied, "Without prior notice, I cannot say at what time it was decided." At this time, a Labor MP stood up and said, "You should be impeached for treason." Attlee said that Mr. Chamberlain had蒙蔽 the House of Commons last Thursday. Chamberlain replied that this was not the case, and said that the statements made at that time were factual. After an intense debate, Attlee said, "In the future, if I have any diplomatic questions, I will raise them in the appropriate place in order to obtain an appropriate response."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The British government recognizes the Spanish Franco government. The Labor Party has put forward a proposal to censure the government, expressing its opinion that "the strength of the Spanish叛军 is based on foreign interference, and the government has rashly given unconditional recognition. This is not something that a friendly country's legitimate government should do, and it is greatly contrary to international customs. The development of this policy will only cause democratic countries to lose confidence in Britain's sincerity."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] The cabinet held a state council meeting at 4 p.m. today, which unanimously resolved to recognize the Franco government as the legitimate government and instructed the Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the Franco government that all assets held by Spain in France should be returned in full. Prime Minister Daladier then submitted a report on the negotiations between Right-wing MP Villard and Franco government Foreign Minister Jordana, as well as the contents of the agreement reached between the two sides. The State Council, recognizing that Villard's mission had been completed, decided to commend and reward him. After Foreign Minister Bonnet reported on the general diplomatic situation, he announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was scheduled to meet on March 2 to decide on the first ambassador to the Franco government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué today, announcing that France recognized the Spanish Franco government, stating that the French government was prepared to establish伕 and that property belonging to Spain would be returned to the Franco government, and that France and Spain had stated that they had a common意颐, that the two countries should maintain a friendly and harmonious relationship.</p>
<p>U.S. Attitude: Under Consideration</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The State Department announced that the U.S. Embassy in Spain, temporarily located in Panbinan, has now closed. Charge d'affaires桑斯顿 will go to Saint Jean de Luz. Ambassador Bowers has been there since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Diplomatic circles believe that if the United States also recognizes the Franco regime like Britain and France, then Bowers and桑斯顿 will both be dispatched to Madrid to establish the U.S. Embassy. Well-informed sources here believe that the United States needs to consider the recognition of the Franco government for a considerable period of time. There are two reasons for this: (1) Washington needs to pay attention to Franco's policies toward the countries in the north and south that have cultural ties with Spain, such as if he attempts to promote fascist propaganda in South America, it will arouse the aversion of the United States. (2) The U.S. government is closely watching how Franco treats the people he has conquered. If Franco takes drastic retaliatory measures against the leaders of the Republican government and their sympathizers, the United States will not recognize the Franco government.</p>

<p>German Government Expresses Welcome</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 28th] This morning, British newspapers have written lengthy commentaries on the British and French governments' recognition of the Franco government as the legitimate government of Spain. The "Daily Telegraph" still insists on the point of view that refusing to recognize the Franco regime will无延长 the Spanish Civil War. The "Daily Mail" claims that everything must be practical and realistic, and that Britain's failure to judge the situation correctly when Italy occupied Abyssinia should not be repeated today. The newspaper also carries a special article on the front page stating that央国 has decided to send warships to the 马德里 area of Spain to evacuate 10,000 troops from the 西 government army, and that France and the United States have also adopted this measure. In addition, the left wing and the Labour Party in London's political circles指 during the debate in the House of Commons that Britain's recognition of the佛朋哥 government was an act of rebellion against public opinion. At the same time, the Labour Party's newspaper, the "Daily Herald," claimed that the 西 Republican government still exists and that Chamberlain's proposal to recognize General Franco as having the rights of a belligerent group was a卑污 act.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 28th] A German spokesperson said regarding Britain's recognition of the Franco government that although Britain's recognition was somewhat late, it was better than not recognizing it. Therefore, the government expressed its extreme welcome for Britain's actions. Spain is a part of Europe, so anyone concerned about peace in Europe welcomes any沙骤 to resolve the Spanish issue.</p>

<p>Italian-Polish Talks Conclude</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] According to a dispatch from Warsaw by Geda, the editor of the Italian newspaper, Ciano's trip to Warsaw can be considered to have come to an end. It is said that the two sides only explained each other's positions and did not involve signing an agreement. Therefore, various speculations are wrong. However, the most noteworthy thing is that the Polish government showed a friendly attitude towards the Axis countries. This attitude itself is an important factor. This means that while the Polish government is loyal to the Polish-French alliance, it is still a tool for a policy that does not hinder the legitimate rights of Germany and Italy. According to the Italian press, the Polish government's intention to hold a leading position in the Danube River basin without the support of Germany and Italy does not seem to be in line with the position of Polish political circles. The newspaper believes that if 波欲 wishes to implement its policy in the Danube region, it can only cooperate with the Axis countries and other countries along the Danube River. The newspaper concludes that the result of Ciano's trip is not only to obtain a guarantee of friendship, but also to exchange opinions and clarify the general situation, and its true value can be见诺 in the future.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 28th] According to a message from 波京 by Geda, the editor of the "Italian Daily", Ciano's visit to 波, from a political point of view, has ended.盖 said that because变方 had no intention of concluding an agreement, it was only to clarify each other's positions. All speculations are baseless. 盖达叹叹各方 to pay attention to the Polish government's attitude, because if the Polish government continues to maintain an alliance with France, it will inevitably refuse to adhere to the policies of Germany and Italy. According to 艺达, the Polish government now wishes to preserve absolute independence and not be involved in any一方. 蓝达 concludes that Ciano's 之波尚 has further developments.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, Senator Sheppard, mentioned "the hostile attitude of certain dictatorial imperialist countries" when debating the government's $358,000,000 army and air force armament bill in the Senate today. His personal view, based on President Roosevelt's recent message to Congress, is that the U.S. Army must be expanded immediately so that it can reach the standard of 6,000 aircraft in 1941. He said, "Where are the land and sea boundaries of our country?菩人 cannot剧明, and what we need to defend is this boundary. The Panama Canal, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska are all important lines of defense for us. Once these military strongholds fall into the hands of the enemy, our country's security will be destroyed. If the Panama Canal cannot be controlled, our existing navy will no longer be able to protect both oceans, and our defense plan will collapse. We certainly hope that we do not have to resort to war to maintain the義门 Monroe Doctrine and the freedom of this 牟球, but if we cannot not fight, we must take immediate action." Republican Senator Vandenberg requested that before the bill is passed, the government must accurately explain the United States' foreign policy to Congress.

Senate Democratic leader Barkley said that the Senate can hold a vote before this weekend, but some parties said that the passage of the defense bill may be delayed due to attacks from isolationist elements. However, it has become a foregone conclusion that the Senate will be able to formulate a bill based on this as soon as possible. The isolationist elements unanimously expressed their support for the internal affairs part of the defense bill, but they strongly opposed the President's recent remarks on foreign policy. They all believed that the United States should avoid accepting any restrictions outside the Western Hemisphere. Senators琼森,奈氏, and莱诺 all held this view.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Please Learn from President Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to set an example and promote thrift and donations, made a private donation of $10,630 on the 27th. Moreover, President Chiang Kai-shek's usual banquets already adhere to a standard of no more than one dollar per person. In recent days, he has repeatedly used the buffet banquet promoted by the New Life Movement, which costs only 40 or 50 cents per person. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, also presented the $5,650 in royalties she recently earned from writing for newspapers and magazines. Because of this, overseas Chinese people were also moved to donate thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>This kind of behavior by the leading couple is, on the one hand, a demonstration for the whole country, enough to make the greedy honest and the cowardly stand up. On the other hand, it demonstrates to the world the greatness of the Chinese national spirit and the infinite hope for the future, enough to increase international sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Our war of resistance and nation-building is an extremely arduous undertaking, and we must concentrate and unify all living and non-living forces in the country. The premise for concentrating and unifying these forces is that every Chinese child who does not want to be a slave to a subjugated country can endure extraordinary poverty and hardship. The senior leaders leading the war of resistance are mostly able to endure hardship, such as Mao Zedong and others, who have long been praised by foreigners for only receiving a national currency salary of two yuan per month. Now, President Chiang Kai-shek is doing his best to reduce his private living expenses and donate them to the country and the nation, which is even more worthy of national love and learning. In particular, given President Chiang Kai-shek's position and status, he still stipulates that the cost of a meal should not exceed one dollar (equivalent to only five dimes in Hong Kong dollars!). How should we reflect on and correct our daily lives even more! Secondly, Madame Chiang Kai-shek's enthusiastic donations should especially be a model for every well-fed woman. If every woman can correct current malpractices, earnestly save money, and encourage her lover, husband, and children, the benefit to the country and the nation will be beyond what ordinary figures can express.</p>
<p>We hope that in addition to admiring President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, everyone will quickly resolve to learn from their perseverance and struggle, do their best to reduce material enjoyment, and do their best to dedicate all their intelligence, resources, and wealth. If we endure temporary hardships today, we can enjoy eternal freedom and happiness in the future. This matter should be given special attention by our overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Hitler's Mouthpiece: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Chang, originally published in the February issue of Parade magazine</p>
<p>Last October, from the sand dunes of the North Sea to the hills of the Sudetenland, 76 million Germans enthusiastically celebrated the birthday of one person. However, most of them did not like this person, and even more people hated and feared this person. This person is the well-known German Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Every radio station in Germany broadcast his biography, every newspaper published articles congratulating him, and came up with various reasons to praise his greatness. This was the grand occasion when all sectors of Germany celebrated his 41st birthday. Why was he so loved and welcomed? The reason is very simple: because if you don't celebrate his birthday, he can easily make you uneasy!</p>
<p>The smog-filled industrial area of ​​the Ruhr, known as the center of the German steel industry, has a city full of factories called Rheydt. This is where Goebbels was born. On October 29, 1897, Goebbels, who had weak legs, was born into a working-class family. His father was a foreman in a factory, and his mother was a blacksmith's daughter. This baby gradually grew up, and because of the disability in his feet, he became a limping child with a staggering gait. His large head and thin shoulders seemed out of proportion. He couldn't run as fast as other children, so he could only study. In his peculiar mind, he cultivated great ambitions and aspirations for the future.</p>
<p>In 1914, the unprecedented World War broke out in Europe. German youths rushed to the front lines to participate in the war. However, the 17-year-old Goebbels, because of the disability in his feet, could not serve in the military. He replaced military service with studying, running from one university to another, and diligently seeking knowledge. Finally, in 1921, he graduated from the University of Heidelberg with a doctorate in philosophy with excellent grades. At the same time, he also studied Marx and socialism.</p>
<p>At that time, the German revolution was brewing. If the French army had not occupied the Ruhr, Goebbels, who came from a working-class family, might have become a communist. The German people regarded the fall of the Ruhr as a great shame. At the same time, many workers overthrew the united "workers of the world" belief. Goebbels believed that this kind of national wound would one day form the rise of new nationalism. He also foresaw that this movement was an important tool for developing his ambitions. In 1922, he heard about the Munich National Socialist Party organization and its leader Hitler; at this point, he found the tool he had in mind.</p>
<p>Goebbels used his outstanding talent to organize the National Socialist Party's sound propaganda machine. He ran a newspaper with very little capital, named it "People's Freedom Newspaper," and gradually developed his ideas. No colleague believed him. Everyone called him "the devil in the party," but they all admired his talent. At first, he both hated and loved Hitler, envying Hitler for being the leader of the party. At the same time, he praised Hitler and knew very well that promoting Hitler's position was the only way to reveal his own wishes.</p>
<p>Goebbels received a high level of education and was knowledgeable. He was often praised as "Hitler's Brain Trust." He and Hitler's favorite Göring worked together to lead the National Socialist Party to success. Of course, the main figure behind the scenes was still Hitler. Hitler shouted: The sabotage of Jews and socialists turned Germany's glorious victory in the European War into a shameful failure. Goebbels heard the news and went everywhere to promote it, making every effort to use his "attack newspaper" to bring this baseless slander to the people of the country. This is the origin of the anti-Jewish movement. Undoubtedly, Goebbels was the main actor in initiating this tragedy.</p>
<p>Goebbels became famous in the political arena after 1926. In 1928, he was elected a member of parliament. In 1919, he took the important position of Director of Propaganda of the National Socialist Party. In 1933, after Hitler seized power, he appointed him as Minister of Propaganda. At that time, Goebbels was only 36 years old and became the youngest minister in German history. After he took office as Minister of Propaganda, he immediately controlled all newspapers, cinemas, theaters, radio stations and other propaganda-related businesses throughout the country.</p>
<p>Only a small part of the German people welcomed Goebbels. That small part was the workers in the Ruhr industrial area. Goebbels knew how to please the working class. Since 1920, he had shouted many times to the workers in Berlin: "Arise—young workers! You are the masters of the new Germany!" How touching! Hitler got the support of the labor community. Goebbels's achievements came first, but since the National Socialist Party came to power, it has not brought much benefit to the German workers. They are very pitiful. Except for a small part of the workers, Goebbels did not get the slightest affection from the people. They murmured to themselves, complaining, "This guy is a born devil. No sincere German is as cunning as him!"</p>
<p>People secretly complain. But they still enthusiastically celebrate Goebbels's birthday: Because this Propaganda Minister holds the highest authority, if you don't celebrate his birthday, he can easily make you uneasy!</p>

<p>Our Newspaper News</p>
<h3 id="e44">Before Negotiations on Compensation for the Bombing of Lo Wu, the Colonial Secretary Personally Investigates the Losses; The Investigation Is Complete and Negotiations Can Begin Next Week; British-Japanese Agreement to Designate Shenzhen as a Refugee Area <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the British-Japanese negotiations on compensation for the bombing in Hong Kong, the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, told reporters yesterday that he personally went to the scene of the incident to investigate the damage caused by the Japanese aircraft bombing in Hong Kong. All the necessary investigation items have been completely completed today (28th). The investigation items include life, property, and land. This is a one-sided investigation, and no Japanese representatives participated. The negotiation date will probably begin next week. According to private investigations, the aircraft dropped six bombs on the British territory of Lo Wu that day, causing the following damage to Hong Kong's lives and property: (A) Eight people died; (B) The rear of the 11th military post was flattened; (C) The windows and doors of the 74th and 80th third-class carriages parked at Lo Wu Station were shattered, and the carriages were strafed by machine guns. The glass in the station garage was broken; (D) One telephone line from Lo Wu to Sheung Shui was destroyed; (E) A hole was blasted in the Kwang-Kow Railway roadbed between Lo Wu and Sheung Shui; (F) The air vent and fire box of the 3rd locomotive were destroyed; (G) The 47th bridge sign was destroyed. The official loss report has not yet been released. The above situations have been photographed and used as evidence by officials.</p>
<p>British-Japanese Agreement to Designate Refugee Area</p>
<p>Since the aircraft madly bombed Shenzhen on the 21st of last month, the Shenzhen refugee camp was also affected. At that time, more than × people were unfortunately killed or injured. For the sake of the safety of the people, the person in charge of relief affairs specially set up north and south refugee camps in Man Kam To, San Uk Ling, and the carriages in Fanling. The Hong Kong authorities believed that it was inconvenient to manage and provide relief to refugees in various places in Shenzhen. Therefore, they repeatedly consulted with the Japanese authorities, intending to designate the original Japanese refugee camp in Shenzhen as a reception center. However, the Japanese side requested that the responsibility for its management be entrusted to the Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Relief Association, just like the Baizhedong and Fangcun areas in Guangzhou that have already fallen.</p>
<p>Joint Work Ordered to End</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities accepted the proposal. Therefore, on the 26th of last month, they ordered the administrators of the north and south refugee camps in Fanling to end relief affairs by a certain date. From now on, the responsibility will be borne by the Chinese Emergency Refugee Relief Association. Other relief agencies and charitable organizations can be relieved of their responsibilities. After receiving the order, the Relief Group of the Relief Federation had to temporarily move food, miscellaneous items, and important staff to the Fanling Tea House to await the resolution of the Relief Federation Congress and Tung Wah Hospital. For this reason, Lin Jinsheng, director of the Relief Group, yesterday reported on the situation of relief affairs and its work. The report was tens of thousands of words long, so that people in the community could clearly understand the process. It briefly stated that since the end of last month, no less than 100,000 refugees have fled to Hong Kong and the border area.</p>
<p>The Entire Plan Was Blasted to Pieces</p>
<p>Chinese and Western people in Hong Kong set up shelters in various places in the New Territories. Later, for the sake of unified relief, the Relief Federation officials divided the districts into eight stations. Later, the government authorities ordered the Relief Federation to move all the refugees in each station to the former Japanese-owned Yiusang Company site in Shenzhen and build public camps there, in order to strictly analyze the local people mixed in with the refugees. After receiving the order, the Relief Federation began to relocate the stations one after another in December of last year, and all of them were completed by January of this year. It is estimated that apart from those who voluntarily asked to return to their place of origin and those who were unwilling to be accommodated, there were about 3,000 refugees. Just as the Relief Group of the Relief Federation was about to engage in educational facilities and industrial and handicraft undertakings, and was gradually getting on the right track, the strike of the aircraft on the 21st of last month shattered the entire relief plan. Although the general refugees have jointly appealed to the Relief Group to continue to handle it, it may be difficult to be effective due to the order of the authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Paying Warm Tribute to Young Friends! Our Newspaper's Essay Contest for Middle School Students; Award Ceremony to be Held This Afternoon at the Swiss Hotel <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Cheuk</p>
<p>First, pay tribute!</p>
<p>Youth is the vanguard of the war of resistance, and youth is also the backbone of national construction. Our newspaper loves young people and hopes that young people will strive to love themselves. Therefore, the Hong Kong Middle School Student War of Resistance Essay Contest was held in the hope of encouraging middle school students' interest in writing and enthusiastically and correctly carrying out the sacred task of national salvation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since the news was released, students from various schools have enthusiastically participated and submitted their essays one after another. This is indeed a gratifying and encouraging phenomenon. Up to the deadline, a total of 143 essays were received, and they have been judged and 25 names have been selected. They have been published in our newspaper in recent days. Detailed statistics can be found on the second page of today's newspaper.</p>
<p>I remember someone saying this: The three things foreigners do when they open the door are: milk, bread, and newspapers. However, it seems that many of our young friends have learned to drink milk and eat bread, but not many have learned to read newspapers. Seeing and being concerned about the news of our newspaper's essay contest, and being able to muster the courage to respond, these 143 young friends are indeed alert young people, lovely young people, and aspiring young people. We should first pay warm tribute to the 143 young friends who participated in our newspaper's War of Resistance Essay Contest.</p>
<p>Although we are limited by the number of places, we only selected 25 names; however, the other 118 have their own strengths in thinking and writing, and we have no discrimination in our spiritual encouragement and respect. Everyone has had one more learning opportunity, gained one more experience, and can be considered to have gained something. With this attitude, continue to work hard, and the hope for the future is limitless.</p>
<p>The Most Touching Appeal</p>
<p>In the 143 essays in this contest, it goes without saying that each has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, one student from a certain English college targeted the Hong Kong environment and issued a moving appeal, which really resonated with us deeply and applauded enthusiastically. His original text is:</p>
<p>"...We know that Hong Kong students, especially those who study English in English colleges, are the least organized and lack national consciousness. Because Hong Kong society needs English, there are a very large number of English colleges set up for Chinese people in Hong Kong. Although their tuition fees are very expensive, the number of students is always full, because most parents hope that their children can easily find a job in major foreign firms and government offices after graduating from English colleges. Because Chinese subjects are rarely used in such an environment, a very strong atmosphere of valuing English and despising Chinese has been formed in the Hong Kong English student community."</p>
<p>Then, this alert young friend also said something that many people want to say but haven't said: "The proof of this fact is that we often see and hear large groups of young men and women chattering and laughing in foreign languages, almost forgetting that they are Chinese!"</p>
<p>——Almost forgetting that they are Chinese, every word is a tear, how touching it is!</p>
<p>"If we want to spread the seeds of national salvation in such an environment, we must first eliminate the ××××× ideology, and always remember the generosity of the motherland and care about everything about the motherland."</p>
<p>"Hong Kong English students, in view of the seriousness of the national crisis, also have passionate shouts: "I want to join the ranks of national salvation! I want to join the ranks of national salvation" You see, Hong Kong University has been actively engaged in various national salvation activities recently, and there are also students from the American Academy on the list of serving the country."</p>
<p>How inspiring is the fact that Hong Kong students are making progress! The motherland is eagerly looking forward to such awakened children continuing to rise up!</p>
<p>A Gratifying Phenomenon</p>
<p>In the 143 essays in this contest, most of them are indeed making us pleasantly surprised at the awesomeness of the younger generation in terms of thinking and writing. The motherland is in rebirth, and the grandchildren of the Chinese nation are also advancing bravely.</p>
<p>The champion, Zhang Dalian, said: "...If we don't lay a good theoretical foundation, how can we organize and train the masses... So first, we must strengthen self-education... Use a research-style and critical attitude to read extracurricular books, and use reading seminars and self-criticism as reading methods... Secondly, external national salvation work must move from adapting to the environment to changing the environment, focusing on the practicality of work and not on the form of work... For the sake of true peace and for our eternal survival, we must make the greatest efforts and enthusiasm, not caring about all difficulties and setbacks, not wasting a minute of time, and advancing towards the future of the war of resistance."</p>
<p>The runner-up, Huang Baozhen, said:</p>
<p>"Even if there is a very rich and complete work plan, it is just a good-looking article, and it is difficult to address the current situation. We must use the winter vacation as an opportunity for reflection and improvement..."</p>
<p>In addition, there are many specific national salvation works, which are also pertinent and wonderful. Due to space limitations, it is inconvenient to describe them in detail.</p>
<p>Today's Award Ceremony</p>
<p>To commemorate this essay contest, our newspaper has specially set today at 2:00 p.m. to hold the award ceremony on the second floor of the Swiss Hotel, and to provide refreshments as a token of respect. Dear young friends: Come on, let's shake hands warmly!</p>
<h3 id="e47">Giant Rock Crushes People: A Tragedy Occurs at the Lin Ma Hang Mine Yesterday; Nine Miners Meet a Tragic End; Three Instantly Killed with Brains and Flesh Exploded; Six Seriously Injured and Sent to the Hospital for Treatment <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Lin Ma Hang mine in Ta Ku Ling, New Territories, is contracted to a certain mining company by the government for exploitation, employing a large workforce of up to a thousand miners, working day and night non-stop. The mine shafts penetrate deep into the inner layers of the earth. Unexpectedly, at four o'clock yesterday morning, a tragic incident occurred, resulting in the death or injury of nine miners. Before the accident, nine workers were ordered by the foreman to descend into the mine to excavate minerals, using lights to illuminate their work. The mine shaft extended several tens of feet deep into the earth's inner layers. Unexpectedly, while they were excavating, a massive rock weighing approximately four [unit of weight] became dislodged due to the loosening of the soil, causing it to fall. The nine workers were unable to escape in time and were crushed. Upon hearing that the nine workers had been injured by the rock fall, people from the mine immediately descended into the mine to devise a method to lift the rock for rescue. Among these nine workers, three were standing in a location directly beneath the falling rock, resulting in their heads being crushed and brains exploded, limbs broken, and severe internal injuries, causing instant death. In one case, the internal organs of the deceased were also crushed out, a truly gruesome sight. The remaining six workers were fortunate enough not to be killed, but they also sustained serious injuries, with some having broken limbs and others suffering injuries to their bodies. All of them fainted due to the severity of their injuries. After rescuing the six injured, the miners immediately reported the incident to the Sheung Shui Police Station. Upon receiving the report, the duty officer dispatched police detectives to the scene to investigate the cause of the tragic event and telegraphed for ambulances to transport the six injured to the Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The bodies of the three deceased were taken to the Kowloon mortuary in a hearse for autopsy. It is reported that all nine of the miners who perished were young men in their twenties and thirties.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Grand Horse Race Today is the Fourth Day: The Championship Battle for Chinese Horses; "Nosey Like" Will Compete with "Shirley's Gift" to Determine the Victor <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the third day of the Grand Horse Race, which was the final for the Australian horses. Before the event, the public largely expected "Wakey Wakey", "Silly Ton" or "Leah Who Leah" to win, and the Governor's wife's "Dee and Knee Yarn" also had a lot of supporters. Unexpectedly, the Chow brothers' "Lin La Cum Fin Dee" emerged as a dark horse, leading from the start and ultimately winning the top spot. Winning tickets paid out over four hundred dollars each. The competition between "Silly Ton" and "Wakey Wakey" was extremely intense, with the former finishing second and the latter third. "Leah Who Leah" started to fall back after passing the big rock drum, suffering a complete defeat. It is rumored that there was a problem with its foot! In addition, most of the hot horses of the day were successful, and those who liked outsiders were disappointed. Yan Ga Na Sang became uncharacteristically poor, not winning a single time all day. Others who had successful days included Wong Ching Lim, Tao Bo Lin, Bo Heng, Ma Kei, and Pross, each winning twice, while Littau and Zhao Lianbi each won once. Fortunately, there were no further accidents involving horses falling. The linked彩s in both races were won by hot horses, so each ticket was only worth twelve dollars and fifty cents. Today's Chinese horse championship final will see Yu Dongxuan fielding two fierce generals, "Nosey Like" and "Dee Sa Zhi Fu," to challenge "Shirley's Gift." Most opinions believe that "Shirley's Gift" is currently in good form, and with the skilled jockey Bo Heng riding, it will be able to maintain its victory. However, some say that "Nosey Like" has great strength and has repeatedly set new records, and Dee Sa Zhi Fu should not be underestimated, as it could potentially defeat the previous champion. In any case, if the weather and conditions remain unchanged, the battle will be very exciting. If it rains, Shirley's Gift will have the upper hand!</p>
<h3 id="e49">The New British Ship "Glen Line" Arrives in Hong Kong on its Maiden Voyage; A Reception was Held Yesterday for Guests to Visit <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The British Glen Line Shipping Company, in order to promote its Far East shipping business, specifically allocated funds to build six of the newest types of cargo ships, also equipped with passenger cabins. Previously one had already passed by Hong Kong. The "Glen Line" cargo ship arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday on her maiden voyage. This is the first ship of the shipping company to call in Hong Kong. After arriving in Hong Kong, the ship docked at Holt's Wharf, and a reception was held on board yesterday at 6:30 PM to invite guests to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Shantytowns in the Kwun Chung and Tai Kok Tsui Areas are Ordered to be Demolished; 800 Shantytowns in Both Areas will be Completely Demolished; Over 4,000 Poor Residents Must Relocate Today <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Since the poor have flocked to Yau Ma Tei, Canton Road, and the Tai Kok Tsui area to build shanties, these areas have become villages and poor people's districts. The government authorities previously felt that the sanitation of these shantytowns was lacking, and that many of the shanties were flammable materials and thus prone to fire. The poor residents were ordered to find other places to relocate. The poor had previously jointly requested the authorities to allow them to postpone the execution, but recently, in order to maintain stability, the authorities reiterated the previous order and ordered the residents to relocate as soon as possible. It has been found that there are 300 shanties in the Kwun Chung shantytown on Canton Road, housing over a thousand working-class people. The order was issued at the end of October. Some of them have complied with the order and moved to the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp, while others have moved to vacant land in Kowloon City for temporary accommodation. The original shantytowns have been ordered by the authorities to be completely demolished by sanitation workers. As for the Tai Kok Tsui area, there are 500 such shantytowns, housing approximately 3,000 working-class people. They have also been ordered to relocate to other places from yesterday to today. The original shantytowns will be completely demolished today. Those who have nowhere to live will be sent by the health authorities to the Kowloon Ma Tau Chung refugee camp. Therefore, the shantytowns in both areas can be said to have come to an end today.</p>

<p>At 1:20 AM yesterday, a house without a number in Song Wai Ha Village, Ta Ku Ling, New Territories, was broken into and robbed by three robbers. Two of the three robbers were armed with handguns, and one was carrying an electric flashlight. One of the two robbers with guns was also wearing a white mask. They entered the second floor from the water trough and stealthily descended to the first floor. The occupants of the house only woke up after the robbers entered. Seeing that the robbers were holding guns and threatening them, they dared not make a sound and allowed the robbers to search the house. The robbers searched the house for about thirty minutes before fleeing. Afterwards, the resident Cheung Tin (47 years old) went to the Sheung Shui Police Station to report the incident. He said that all the robbers spoke with a Hakka accent. He suspected that the masked robber was someone he knew. After the robbers left, they checked their belongings and found that they had lost eighty-five dollars and two dimes in Hong Kong currency, ninety-five dollars in Kwangtung Provincial Bank legal tender, thirty-five dollars in Central Bank notes, two silver chain necklaces, one silver lock, one silver wallet, one pair of plain silver anklets, and four opium pipes, with a total value of approximately one hundred and sixty-three dollars and two dimes in local currency.</p>

<p>The Pan American Airlines giant Boeing aircraft, originally scheduled to fly from San Francisco to Hong Kong today, has been repeatedly postponed due to the bad weather in the Pacific Ocean in recent days. According to news received in Hong Kong, the aircraft arrived in Midway Island yesterday afternoon. If there are no special weather changes, it will arrive in Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month. Fearing that there will be too many visitors at that time, the China National Aviation Corporation has only issued 250 visitor tickets to invite Hong Kong officials, gentry, and celebrities from all walks of life to visit.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Jockey Club's one-dollar grand彩 draw took place at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. After the first-place ticket number was announced as 404324, by 4:00 PM yesterday, twenty-one hours later, it was still unknown who had won the huge sum. The owners of the second- and third-place prizes were also unknown. However, according to what reporters know, the 404324 ticket was sold on New Year's Day. The ticket holders were four children. These four children received a lot of red envelopes on New Year's Day, and pooled some of it together to buy tickets. They really struck it rich with one hit. Each of the four lucky children won over 60,000 yuan in彩 money, immediately becoming small well-to-do families. It is rumored that the ticket for the second prize was bought by a White Russian who watches horses at the Jockey Club.

<p>The charity bazaar organized by the British Relief Fund's Fundraising Committee closed successfully yesterday. It has been found that over 10,600 yuan in donations were collected over the two days of the 26th and 27th, which can be said to be an excellent result. Yesterday was the last day of the charity bazaar, and there were even more visitors than in the past two days. The organizers, in order to thoroughly sell off the remaining goods, greatly reduced prices to encourage sales. The entertainment stalls, refreshment stalls, and singing performances all had many visitors. All the staff were mobilized and were overwhelmed with customers. The atmosphere was more lively than ever before. The result for the day should not be less than the previous two days.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Unifying the Hong Kong Monetary System; The Authorities are Actively Recalling Old Nickel Coins; All will be Recalled and Declared Obsolete by the End of this Month <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities officially announced on June 15, 1936, the abolition of silver dimes and the implementation of the legal tender system, and issued one-dollar legal tender and ten-cent and five-cent nickel coins to replace silver dollars in circulation. However, when the coins were first issued, there were many counterfeiters, which caused significant losses to the commercial sector. Therefore, the authorities raised funds in England to produce new pure nickel coins to be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Recalling old coins and dispatching staff to supervise</p>
<p>Regarding the old nickel coins currently circulating on the market, the authorities originally intended to recall them all last month and declare them obsolete. Later, because this period coincided with the Lunar New Year, the announcement was postponed again and again. The reporter visited the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Pollock, yesterday to inquire about everything. According to him, now that the Lunar New Year has passed, the authorities intend to implement the recall of old coins during this period, so that the monetary policy can be unified. However, there are still some matters to be considered regarding the recall procedures, so they are actively discussing methods in order to start the actual implementation in early March. Regarding this matter, the Hong Kong government authorities, after consulting with the Financial Secretary and this department, are expected to announce the abolition of old coins by the end of March or early April.</p>
<p>Silver dimes and subsidiary coins are rarely circulating</p>
<p>Currently, in order to realize the unified monetary system as soon as possible, the Treasury Department is not only increasing staff to redeem old coins at a discount, but also dispatching many people to major banks in Hong Kong and China to supervise the recall of old coins and not allow them to be issued again. After the old coins are recalled, they will be melted into nickel ingots in Hong Kong, shipped back to England and England in batches, and new coins will be prepared and sent to Hong Kong later. Pollock went on to mention the issue of silver dimes and subsidiary coins, saying that since the authorities announced the use of silver dimes, they have started to recall them gradually, but as of now, the number is still small. Most of these subsidiary coins are flowing out of Hong Kong, and many Hong Kong merchants are melting silver dimes to make silverware. Therefore, the number of silver coins currently in existence, compared to the total number issued in previous years, can be said to be more than eighty percent. The authorities are currently investigating the amount of silver in existence in preparation for recalling a considerable amount in the future, and the old and new coins will be announced as obsolete at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Entire West River Line's × Military Strength is Empty; Our Army is Actively Preparing for a Counter-Offensive; Between Jiu Jiang and Liang Long × Retreat Along the River Road; Our Army is Encouraging the People to Promote Wartime Tasks <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[West River Express News] The West River front line's × force, since most of it was transferred to invade Hainan Island, has been weak in recent days and is lurking in a corner, not daring to make any changes, so the situation is unusually quiet. There are no significant increases or decreases in the entire line's × force, but there are troop movements and changes of defense between the various points. The West River guerrilla teams are also frequently attacking the × force at various points, launching guerrilla warfare to shake the entire line's × force. Now, our military authorities, since the tense period in the West River has passed, are stepping up efforts to mobilize the people to assist the regular army in strengthening their defensive strength and preparing for a full-scale counter-offensive against the × force. The situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Recent × Force Situation on the Entire West River Line</p>
<p>The West River × force, in recent days, because most of its forces have been transferred and are insufficient to allocate, is trying to cover up its weakness by making frequent troop movements and occasionally firing artillery at our positions to boost its morale. It has been found that the × force at Ganggen Makou has been firing artillery at our Jinli Qingqi area for days, without any target. Our side has ignored it. On the Mup Mian Lam Kong side, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry arrived on the 23rd, and several mountain guns were transported and erected on nearby hills, with sentries assigned to guard and watch. However, part of it had already retreated to Sanshui Southwest on the 25th. On the He Kou side, 200 to 300 × soldiers were transferred from Guangzhou on the 24th to reinforce, and a batch of grain, ammunition, and weapons were transported to the southwest for storage. As for the × forces between He Qing and Jiu Jiang Liang Long, since the 23rd of this month, part of them have retreated along the river road to concentrate in Foshan, attempting to water ming. The × force currently stationed in Jiu Jiang is the Zhi Song guard force, with about 200 soldiers, stationed in the city and in various places such as the Xuexian Temple Shakou. Also, since the × force launched the Haikou landing, the Guangdong × Air Force squadrons have been mostly transferred to Hainan to assist in the battle, and have been wreaking havoc on Qiong Island and various counties in southern Guangdong for days. Therefore, the West River × opportunities have slightly decreased. However, in the past day or two, they have become active again, frequently flying over various counties to scout, but rarely dropping bombs.</p>
<p>Liang Long Team Annihilates × Again</p>
<p>Our guerrilla teams lurking in various points and lines in the West River, seeing that the × army is weak, in order to cut off the × army's communication and response, have launched frequent surprise guerrilla warfare, attacking the × army entrenched in various points. Along the Guangsan Road, our guerrilla teams have been intercepting × transport vehicles, destroying roads and railway tracks in Shishan Zoumaying Xiaotang and other places, and attacking the × camp in Sanshui Southwest. At around 9:00 PM on the 25th night of the month, our Liang Long guerrilla teams gathered dozens of teams, armed with quick-firing Mauser pistols and portable machine guns, and secretly arrived at the × camp when the × soldiers were deep inside. When the × sentries discovered them, our teams had already rushed in and swept the × soldiers with machine guns. The × soldiers, hearing the gunfire, immediately came out to fight, but in the darkness, they did not know how many teams we had, and they were extremely panicked and embarrassed. Finally, they killed more than a dozen × soldiers and injured more than ten. All the team members, having achieved their purpose, safely returned to their original defenses. The × force, after this battle, was extremely panicked and sent more sentries to guard the vicinity of the barracks every night, prohibiting people from coming and going. Even during the day, they were very strict in inspecting our villagers who came and went.</p>
<p>Military-Civilian Cooperation Creates Strong Strength</p>
<p>Since the × force on the Sanshui front line retreated and reduced its strength, it has been unable to invade the west. However, our military authorities, in order to be cautious, believing that the × army is accustomed to adopting the strategy of a feint to the east and attack to the west, have instructed the Gu County government and various teams to step up efforts to mobilize the people to participate in the war of resistance and assist the government in promoting various wartime tasks in order to consolidate social order and strengthen the forces for defending against × and guarding the territory. Now, the spirit of military-civilian cooperation in various places is even more intense. The × army has repeatedly invaded Qingqi Old Sanshui, and our military and civilians have been able to jointly resist ×. Glorious deeds have been successively demonstrated. It has also been found that the teams in various counties in the West River, after receiving the orders of the Commander of the Fourth War Zone, have been transferred to various defense forces and tax police regiments, and are now joining the front line, stationed in Luobao, Mafang, Hantang, Liantang, Dasha, Beishui, and the Gulou Sanshou area, waiting for orders and waiting for opportunities to counter-attack. Now our West River defense force is extremely strong and can be guaranteed to be safe.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Our Army Counter-Attacks Qiongshan; The War on Qiong Island is Gradually Stabilizing; × Occupies Yulin Port and Forbids Foreign Ships to Dock <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Northern × Express News] Recently, a telegram from a certain place on Qiong Island reported that our army has been counter-attacking Qiongshan for days and has repeatedly won victories. The × army entrenched in the county town, and the × army stationed in the suburbs, have all retreated into the city. There are no traces of them in the vicinity of the suburbs. On the 18th of this month, our army launched a large-scale counter-attack towards Ding'an. The local people rose up in response. × was caught off guard and suffered more than 2,000 casualties. At this moment, the war on Qiong Island is gradually stabilizing. The anti-× self-defense groups in various places are now rising up one after another, preparing to kill ×. The morale is high, which has never happened before. It is also reported that more than 30 × ships have arrived overseas, seemingly intending to invade the south. Yulin Port has also been blockaded by × ships, prohibiting foreign ships from sailing.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Guangdong Province will Punish the Officers and Soldiers who Failed to Fight Effectively after Investigation by Military Law <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since the war of resistance in Guangdong Province was launched, Guangzhou fell in less than a month, and the public was in an uproar. General Yu immediately reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to severely punish the officers and soldiers who failed to fight effectively. Now, the 12th Army Corps, following the instructions of Chairman Chiang, in addition to the 451st Brigade Commander He Lianfang and the concurrently 151st Division Commander Mo Xiyi, who are being tried by the General Supervisor of Military Law Execution, will punish the remaining derelict officers and soldiers separately. Ye Zhinan, the regiment commander of the 1096th Regiment of the 186th Division, was ordered to flank the × people near Fuliu, but failed to make an effort. Li Rufeng, the regiment commander of the Independent First Regiment, also failed to make an effort in the battle at Yonghanxu. They were both dismissed from their posts for investigation. Li Zhenqiu, the division commander of the 186th Division, was assigned to fight on the front line in Zengcheng but failed to make an effort to accomplish the task. Liang Shiji, the division commander of the 154th Division, failed to provide timely assistance in Conghua in accordance with the order. Each of them was given a major demerit. Chen Wei Wu, the commander of the Independent Twentieth Division, and Wu Luxun, the commander of the 922nd Regiment of the 154th Division, were both dismissed from their posts but allowed to remain in their positions to atone for their sins. Li Jiang, the commander of the Guangdong Gendarmerie and acting commander of the Guangzhou Garrison, retreated without authorization and will be severely punished. Guo Siyan, the commander of the Humen Fortress, was dismissed from his post and arrested. They will be handled separately by the Department of Military Law Execution and the Personnel Department of the General Supervision Department. The rumor that Chen Wei Wu has been transferred to the Chief of Staff of the Military Region Command is inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Funeral of a National Hero <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— By Bai Wei</p>
<p>— A Quick Sketch of the Public Funeral for Soldiers Who Died in the East River Anti-Japanese War —</p>
<p>This is a glorious and tragic funeral. It contains a glorious and tragic history.</p>
<p>On October 12th of last year, the × people landed from Daya Bay, occupied Danbu, and then our defending troops in Danshui retreated to Longgang and Yonghu. However, the entire company of 110 soldiers of the Second Transport Company of the First Battalion of the Nine Hundred and Second Regiment of the 451st Brigade and another unit of friendly forces advanced along the Hui-Danshui Highway, braving the bombing of the × people's planes in groups, without any fear or disorder. They arrived safely at Xiaoguabang near the outskirts of Huizhou on the 13th evening. Xiaoguabang Mountain is located at the midpoint of the communication from Danjiao, and it is an important area below Fozu Temple, and also the first shield around Huizhou. The mountains rise and fall, and the short temples are luxuriant. We have built several fortifications here. Therefore, after the Second Company arrived, although they felt that the strength of the company was weak, and the soldiers had gone through the bloody battle in Danshui, their spirits were extremely exhausted, but in order to save the nation and defend this lone fort of Huizhou, they did not hesitate to gather more than 80 brothers with tired bodies but high morale, and firmly guarded the fortifications of the mountain, preparing to leave the last drop of blood for the nation.</p>
<p>On the 13th night, the × people tracked and chased to Mazhuang at the foot of Xiaoguabang Mountain. The attack began early on the 14th. The unit responsible for the attack was the Xiaowei unit. They first used mountain artillery to bombard, followed by infantry charges. From morning to noon, although a small part of our fortifications were destroyed by the × people's shells, our soldiers were still calmly sweeping. About a dozen × people were killed or injured, but they could not gain a step on the hilltop. Then batches of × planes appeared in the sky, and bombs were thrown and exploded on the mountain. The loud explosions did not shake the hearts of our soldiers at all. The second charge was repelled, with another seven or eight × people killed. Only on the third attempt did they gather five or six hundred people to bypass the back of our Xiaoguabang Mountain and surround us on all sides. The special Hui city had fallen into a state of chaos. Although the soldiers of our company knew the treacherous conspiracy of the × people, they had exhausted all their strength and had no reinforcements. They could only make a great sacrifice, dyeing several fortifications with their blood, fulfilling the soldier's duty to defend the territory.</p>
<p>Since the liberation of Huizhou, the prominent gentleman Mr. Zhang Youren went to collect the remains of these loyal soldiers. Although two months had passed, most of them had not rotted. Each of them was still leaning against the trench, and although there was no gun in their hands, they still tightly clenched their iron fists. Some of them had their eyes open. From the original state of these loyal remains, it can be known how heroic our soldiers were when they died. At the same time, the bodies of the soldiers were all marked with marks of countless bullets, probably because the × people went to rob guns after the soldiers died heroically. The soldiers' bright red blood will illuminate the Chinese nation like Nankou and Baoshan.</p>
<p>Therefore, after Mr. Zhang finished collecting the remains of the entire Second Company, the people from all walks of life in Huizhou held the "Public Funeral Ceremony for Soldiers Who Died in the East River Anti-Japanese War" on the mountain of Shuilian Cave, entrusting the souls of our unnamed national heroes. When we looked up at the loyal remains of the soldiers lying in the coffins, we felt an unspeakable emotion in our hearts, feeling that their blood had been flowing for a long time to fight for the freedom of the nation, and their lives had been sacrificed to continue the life of the nation. Then, how can we who are not dead continue the unfinished aspirations of the martyrs? This is our good example. Why shed tears of blood?</p>
<p>Although the ceremony was simple, it was solemn and dignified. Every participant had a sad and leaping heart. The blood flowers of the martyrs appeared in their eyes, and their feet would move forward with these blood flowers.</p>
<p>Finally, take the couplet drafted by Zherena, the Deputy Commander of the East River Detachment, as the concluding remarks of the recommendation:</p>
<p>The road of merit and benevolence is one, and the road to the famous city is the same. The fortifications are built with liver and courage.</p>
<p>Tears and tears are not my wish. Let's drink half a cup of wine and offer it to ××× tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e61">National Military District Conference: Li Hanhun Proposes Two Important Cases; Evaluating Conscription Performance of Counties and Cities; Strictly Preventing Malpractice in Exemption Regulations <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Quick News] The National Military District Commander Conference, convened by the central military and political authorities in Chongqing, could not be attended by Li Hanhun, Commander of the Guangdong Military District, due to the heavy provincial administration. He specially dispatched a chief of staff as a representative to Chongqing. The representative left Shaoguan yesterday, carrying several proposals submitted by Chairman Li to the conference. It is heard that two important cases are included: one is to strictly establish conscription performance of counties and cities as the standard for evaluating the diligence of responsible officials; the other is to improve the management of exemption from service and strictly prevent local bullies from engaging in malpractice. Instructions have been issued to each division military district and encirclement district to vigorously promote these measures, so as to eliminate the previous malpractices of evading military service. Chairman Li also telegraphed Zhen Daihun, former director of the Political Training Department of the 155th Division, yesterday to urgently come to Shaoguan to fill an important position in the Guangdong Military District Command.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Jiujiang × Military Strength Weak; Heavily Fortified Against Our Advance; Residents Within the Town Limited to Obtain Good Citizen Certificates; People Flee, Finding It Hard to Live Under the Iron Heel <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Jiangmen Quick News] The troops entrenched in various parts of Xijiang have mostly been transferred to Hainan for the invasion war, so their strength has suddenly become weak. In addition to making every effort to shorten the defense line, selecting strongholds, digging deep trenches and building high fortifications, and firmly guarding key points to prevent attacks by our main forces and guerrilla teams, they have also dispatched aircraft to Heshan, Xinhui, Gaoming, and Sihui to conduct reconnaissance in recent days. They are also conducting stricter inspections of the residents in the occupied areas to prevent our plainclothes teams from infiltrating. Moreover, it is found that the Jiujiang × army feels its strength is weak and is deeply afraid of our teams taking the opportunity to attack, so it has recently added defensive works at traffic intersections in the town, dispatched troops to erect small steel cannons and machine guns, and guarded them day and night. On one hand, they are forcing people in the city, regardless of men, women, old or young, to completely obtain good citizen certificates within ten days before they are allowed to reside. If they are found to have not obtained a certificate after the deadline, they will be immediately identified as plainclothes teams or as elements engaged in various anti-enemy activities and executed. However, the Chinese traitors who handle the issuance of certificates are also extorting certificate fees, deliberately delaying the issuance. The people are afraid of being brutally killed by the ×, and they are fleeing one after another, feeling that it is difficult to live under the iron heel.</p>

<p>The previous rumor that Chen Jitang invested tens of millions of yuan to establish a large-scale textile factory in Guangzhou Bay, and that Luo Tingyu was responsible for the preparations, was addressed by our reporter who met Luo yesterday at a certain place. According to him, he had never prepared a textile factory for Chen Jitang, and the matter of Chen investing in setting up a textile factory was also untrue.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Strengthening Three-Dimensional Warfare Capabilities: First Phase of Training for Our New Air Force About to Complete; Second Phase to Expand Enrollment; Regulations for Each Department Drafted <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Lian County Correspondence] Since the launch of the second phase of the War of Resistance, our authorities have felt the importance of three-dimensional warfare, so they have recently greatly developed the new air force. In addition to purchasing a large number of the latest fighter jets from abroad and building a large number of airfields, they also felt the lack of talent for the new air force. The Aviation Committee specially established an air force training institute ahead of schedule, recruiting a large number of air force personnel for training. Now the first phase of training is completed, and the second phase should continue, and will expand enrollment by department. The regulations have also been drafted, and a brief excerpt is as follows: "Regulations for Flight Sergeants": 1. Must be 18 to 20 years old, unmarried, graduated from junior high school, or have equivalent academic qualifications; 2. Must pass a physical examination that meets air force standards; "Mechanical Department": 1.

<p>[Zhongshan Correspondence] Shiqi, Zhongshan, has suffered repeated bombings by × aircraft, resulting in heavy losses. The city's power plant has also been bombed and partially destroyed, resulting in power outages. Every evening, the entire city becomes a dark world. Moreover, in order to avoid daytime air raids, stores in the city are limited to operating at night, using kerosene lamps and gas lamps as a temporary solution, but it is very inconvenient. The county government is even more concerned that petty thieves and thugs will take the opportunity to act rashly, endangering the city's order and affecting the rear area's security. Recently, it was decided to restore the city's power. The plan is to temporarily borrow machinery from a large rice mill in the city for power generation, and first restore street lights and electricity to various agencies stationed in the city to facilitate commerce and official business. The revenue from collecting street light electricity fees will be entirely given to the rice mill that provides electricity. It is understood that this plan is currently being drafted, and once it is drafted and properly negotiated with the rice mill merchants, it can be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Fate of Hollywood Silver Stars in 1939 — Predictions by Astrologer Norvell — <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 和</p>
<p>Norvell is a famous silver star fortune teller who has lived in Hollywood for a long time. This year, he once again used the twelve-house astrology method to predict the fortunes of major movie stars this year. Although we cannot believe that these predictions are necessarily accurate, since he has lived there for a long time, he naturally has a panoramic view of the situation. His speculations may even have some small truths. Let's just talk about it casually and listen to it casually, and let the facts be the greatest witness.</p>
<p>Hedy Lamarr... born in December, belongs to the Scorpio zodiac sign (this twelve zodiac signs are equivalent to our country's twelve zodiac animals, the difference is that it takes one month as a unit, and those born in a certain month (belong to a certain zodiac sign)). Her astrology indicates that she will ascend to the highest seat of the silver screen, and will have at least three years of good luck. Looking further ahead, love and marriage will come. She will marry a producer or a big director, in short, a film tycoon. Unfortunately, this marriage will not last long and will eventually end due to incompatible personalities. The third time will be her true and happy love destination.</p>
<p>Van Johnson... This young male star who has shaken the hearts of young girls all over the United States has a bright and brilliant 1939 waiting for him. He will continue to be supported by them and continue to shine brightly. But he must not marry this year, otherwise there will be unfortunate consequences—a divorce is certain within nine years. After that, for example, if he marries in 1940, the marriage will be happy and there is hope of becoming the father of two children.</p>
<p>Born on February 17, he is right in the Aquarius zodiac sign, which is the most suitable for actors. Such as John Barrymore, Adolph Menjou, Clark Gable and Ronald Colman, these famous superstars are all figures in this zodiac sign.</p>
<p>Antoinette Lees... Born on August 18, the day is very auspicious. Her life palace belongs to the Leo zodiac sign. Other people in the same zodiac sign include Myrna Loy, Robert Taylor, Norma Shearer, and William Powell. Judging from her acting skills in "Letter of Introduction," this year should be, and is, the time for her to be proud. Her wedding date should be in this year or 1940. Her married life will be happy and will not hinder her screen life.</p>
<p>Errol Flynn... born on June 20, belongs to the Gemini zodiac sign. 1939 is slightly unfavorable to him. This year he is in danger of affecting his health due to overwork, but his screen work can continue to be successful. Astrology indicates that he has some bad luck with airplanes or vehicles, but this just needs to be careful. He will divorce Lili Damita and form another good relationship.</p>
<p>Tyrone Power... At present, Tyrone Power's popularity is indeed unparalleled among the young actors. His birthday is May 5, which belongs to the Taurus zodiac sign. This zodiac sign symbolizes "wealth," so no wonder he can be so popular. His year will be smooth, but be careful of a decline in reputation at the end of the year. According to astrology, he must not marry within three years, otherwise it will be detrimental to his current status. After this period, there will be even greater wealth. At that time, as long as he is willing, he can give up this life at any time and enjoy his old age in peace.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin... born on May 1, she will have money and status like Tyrone Power. She will have two marriages, so be careful.</p>
<p>Alice Faye... Coincidentally, her birthday is the same day as Tyrone Power, also May 5th. Her fate in the next few years is very good, and she will become more and more popular every day. Because, from the perspective of astrology, there is no sign of setbacks in her career in the next few years. Like Tyrone Power, whether she stays or leaves her screen life will only be decided by herself. The fans will definitely not be unappreciative of her.</p>
<p>Recently, rumors have been spreading in Hollywood that she and her husband Tony Martin are about to divorce. Although she denies it, she cannot hide it from astrology. Although we hope she can avoid this incident, (unfortunately, it is rumored that they have already divorced).</p>
<p>Jean Arthur... This is a relatively senior actress. In 1939, she will still be assigned to play several very important leading roles, and her brilliance will not diminish slightly within five years. She will have two marriages, like Deanna Durbin.</p>
<p>Deanna Bobbing... This lovely name will maintain a long-term relationship with us. In the near future, she will perform in opera on the screen and be very popular. And she will have her presence on stage and in radio broadcasting and film circles. Those are the fields waiting for her to conquer.</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney... Movie fans are often worried that Mickey Rooney is growing up. Will he still be able to continue his screen life, or will he seek another way out in the commercial field? Let's see what his astrology says. The zodiac sign is Libra, born on September 20... There is no sign here that he must leave the film industry. Mickey will definitely still be an actor when he grows up, and he will still be popular. His fresh personality and childish acting skills will remain constant. It is too early to get married, it will be around the age of 23.</p>
<p>Olivia de Havilland... She has three to five years of good luck. During this period, she will become more and more popular every day. Her marriage should be in this year or the first half of next year. Her life palace belongs to the Cancer zodiac sign. Other people in this zodiac sign include James Cagney, Merle Oberon, Doris Nolan, and Barbara Stanwyck.</p>
<p>To put it simply, those who can succeed this year also include Ray Milland, Priscilla Lane, Paulette Goddard, Mary Livingston, Nan Grey, and Nan Sanker.</p>
<p>In terms of real stars, Shirley Temple currently occupies the leading position in the "chick" group. But will she be able to permanently occupy this throne? Her life palace, like Mary Pickford, also belongs to the Aries zodiac sign, and it is destined that she will engage in film life for life like this veteran film queen. Only between the ages of 14 and 17 will there be a period of temporary retirement. When she returns to the film industry for the second time, she can still maintain the status of a first-class star.</p>
<p>Shirley's biggest rival, the Dionne quintuplets, will end their artistic lives due to marriage after a long period of service in the film industry.</p>
<p>"Wildcat" Kim Hye-soo will turn to broadcasting and the stage. "Little Lord" Freddie Bartholomew will leave the film industry next year and return to Hollywood after completing his higher education. And next year or the year after, we will no longer see Jackie Cooper's films. The grown-up Jackie Cooper will abandon film and engage in business.</p>
<p>Ronald Colman, from this year on, will comfortably shoot only one or two films a year, and his marriage will also be extremely happy. Gary Cooper will not divorce, and his film life will continue for several years. Only John Barrymore may have some marital troubles.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford will remarry, and Greta Garbo, the mysterious girl of the past, will have fewer new films produced after 1939.</p>
<p>Predictions are ultimately predictions. "Man can conquer nature" and "It depends on human effort." There is hope of reversing the will of heaven. Thinking this way, the two sentences "Let's just talk about it casually and listen to it casually" become even more necessary.</p>

<h3 id="e68">The General Association Should Deal with the Governor's Cup; An Ideal Lineup Was Drafted Yesterday; Seeking Opinions from Related Associations <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report] The second battle of the Governor's Cup between the Chinese Sports Association's Chinese team and the Football Association's Western team is scheduled to be held on the 5th of this month (Sunday) at Caroline Hill. Remembering the first game, the Chinese team got off to a good start and won the first victory. If they win or draw this time, they will regain the championship. If the Chinese team fails this time, they will have to fight the Western team for the third time. From this point of view, this battle can be described as a matter of life and death for both sides. The General Association feels deeply ashamed of the previous failure and is trying to select capable players in the hope of breaking the Chinese team's dream of winning the championship. However, since Logan and Watson returned to England, they have felt the sigh of difficulty in finding talent. The left wing position is even more difficult to find. It is heard that the General Association will seek opinions from related associations on the following ideal lineup. If all agree, it will be used as the official lineup. According to reporter investigations, Yan Shishiro is still at sea with the fleet and it is unknown whether he can return to Hong Kong in time to respond to this battle. Therefore, only Feibeng is listed for the right wing position, pending public decision. The ideal lineup is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>McAlister Navy Team</p>
<p>Shi Han Miduxie Newby Navy Team</p>
<p>Pak Chia Police Association Dickson Navy Team Hannerville Navy Team</p>
<p>Liao Yachen Kowloon Association Soo Miduxie Gosanno Saint Joseph Zuo Zhi Kowloon Association Armstrong Navy Team</p>

<p>— Lai Duanfu</p>
<p>This article is fixed to be published every Wednesday and Sunday, come rain or shine. However, the previous issue was delayed due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Therefore, this issue must discuss the past two weeks of football matters together.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Philippines Intercity Match has become a thing of the past, and it has been talked about a bit too much. I originally did not want to add a detailed review, but I have to express my opinion briefly. Remembering that the performance of the Hong Kong team in the two trial matches was unsatisfactory. However, when competing with the Philippine team, they actually won easily with a score of four to one. Also, in view of the Philippine team's three defeats in three battles and their defeat of one to two in their expedition to Australia, those who know the goods all said that the Philippine team's football technical level can only be compared with that of the Hong Kong Second Division. Some people even think that Bowserly, Yao Jidi, and Weilandnuwa are very good. Assuming that the Philippine team participates in the First Division competition in Hong Kong, there is also hope for five players to be included. Considering this kind of criticism, Zhu Mian exposed his childish appearance of evaluating football, and the writing style is also unlike that of a scholar. Bowserly is indeed the best player in the Philippine team, which is appreciated by everyone. Yao Jidi is also a promising talent. As for referring to Weilandnuwa, this is a big mistake based on the "official words" of Western newspapers. We said that the Philippine team only has the level of the Hong Kong Second Division, which refers to the entire team. It is impossible to insist that the entire team is good just because there are two or three capable players in the entire team. Today, the five battalion artillery troops, South China and Miduxie of the Hong Kong Second Division, do they not have the qualifications for the First Division and have they not been selected as good villages for important competitions? However, if the entire team is transferred to the First Division, I don't know if they can reach five players. Isn't this example obvious? Do those new scholars who want to boast about their superior insights in football commentary also understand this?</p>
<p>The recent victory of the Eastern team over South China is due to the insufficient manpower of the "Chufeng" team, resulting in a performance far inferior to that of the Eastern team. However, the performance of the Eastern team has indeed been improving day by day, especially the performance on that day was one of the best highlights of this season. The two goals conceded were due to the goalkeeper's occasional abnormality, resulting in this mistake. The author naturally has the duty to correct uncivilized behavior, but to point out that someone is uncivilized in Hong Kong, where the judiciary is strict, I really admire the author's "courage."</p>
<p>The Eastern team has made a lot of progress. What is most gratifying is that the defense has also made significant progress. From now on, I hope they will sweep straight down and rise step by step, at least reaching the runner-up position, reserving a foundation for being selected for the World Games in the future.</p>
<p>South China South once defeated the Hong Kong Club with a score of 6 to 0, and was able to promote Li Enliang and use people properly. The future is bright. I am very optimistic about South China for this reason. Moreover, the newly acquired fearless Zhang Rongcai guards the goal, just like a fierce tiger with wings, Hai Dianchui is brave, and there seems to be no need to fear. As the saying goes, "Born of desperation," I believe that if South China can work hard to defeat the stubborn Ninth Brigade team in the Kowloon venue, there is a high probability that they will also defeat the Navy and eventually win the championship. Brother Sang Yu was originally very insightful when he saw the Navy's strong generals returning and worried about South China in advance, but he forgot that there was a joint Far East Fleet large-scale exercise in Singapore in March. According to my estimation, if the date of South China's game against the Navy is not held during the exercise, it will definitely be postponed to the final scene of the league. Genuine fans can eat a "reassuring pill."</p>
<p>The three First Division matches in this Saturday's football league are all worth noting. The Southern South team attaches importance to the championship issue, even the slightest point cannot be lost. At that time, there will naturally be no more careless performances. Although Guanghua is brave, it is mostly made up of former South China players, whose routines are well known to the experienced South China players. There is no reason for the Southern South team not to win. The Eastern team will become stronger and stronger as the game progresses, and is still very hopeful for the runner-up position. Moreover, breaking Kowloon Club's unbeaten record at that stadium is also the ambition of any team. At that time, there is absolutely no reason to relax in the slightest, and there will definitely be a good performance. Although South China no longer has hope of winning the championship, they must not be too far behind. Moreover, they have the responsibility to indirectly benefit their brothers by defeating the Navy. I am convinced that after the acupuncture, they will work hard to deal with Saint Joseph, who is at the bottom of the table, and winning will be more than enough. Midu's game against the 9th Battalion Artillery in the Second Division is of great importance to the Second Division championship. If South China wants to win the championship, in addition to hoping that the Midu team will defeat the artillery team, they must continue to work hard and not lose anything else in order to succeed.</p>
<p>Because there is the second Governor's Cup game this Sunday between the Chinese Sports Association's Chinese team and the Hong Kong Football Association's Western team, there will be no league matches. In last year's first competition, the Chinese team defeated the Western team with a score of 4 to 1. The competition method is that the team with more wins in the two games wins the championship. Therefore, if the Chinese team wins or draws again this Sunday, they will regain the championship. Judging from the current situation, the Chinese team is much stronger than the Western team, and the victory is assured. However, it is rumored that the Football Association intends to ask Gosano to lead the charge. If so, our team should also ask Li Huitang to help us in order to seek a more stable victory.</p>

<p>I also have a point of view on the selection of the Chinese team. If the Association can get Huitang to help, it would be great. Otherwise, it is advisable to select the following lineup. As for the right inner guard, Hou Rongniu and Mai Shaohan are listed in parallel, because the elderly Mai injured his foot the other day and it is unknown whether he can recover in time. Otherwise, the elderly Hou should be selected. However, Guanghua is not an affiliated association of the Association, and it is unknown whether it is problematic for the elderly Hou to be selected.</p>

<p>The football season is coming to an end. The open grass court tennis tournament will follow without waiting for the football affairs to be completed, and it has been scheduled to open on Monday next week. What is even more surprising about this tennis tournament is that "Mr. Cane" Defu will not participate in the singles competition. In this case, Xu Weipei may still have no opponents in this competition. As for the arrangement order, the Grass Court Tennis Association has the same opinion as the organizers of last year's Hard Court Open, and seems to intend to make the two Xus one of the final finalists. Some say that the organizer lacks consideration, but I say that he is extremely clever and has a pair of bright and forward-looking "business eyes." I hope that Xu's younger brother and older brother can live up to expectations and open the first shot of an all-Chinese final on grass courts.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Men's Open Basketball Tournament: Eight Teams Participate in Group A, Twenty-One Teams Participate in Group B <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Men's Group A and B Open Basketball Tournament, organized by the Hong Kong Basketball Association, has seen enthusiastic participation from various teams since registration began. As of 8 PM last night, there were eight teams registered for Group A and twenty-one for Group B, an unprecedented number. Group A includes Star Island, Pui Ying, Wah Nam College, Eastern, University of Guangzhou, South China, Chung Sing, and University of Hong Kong. Group B includes Fei Zhe, Li Hang, Da Chung, Yung Yuen, Hoi Kwong, Ling Ying, Pui Ying, Indian Police, Kwan Lui, YMCA, Youth Workers, Wah Nam, Wah Kiu Middle School, International, South China, Chung Sing, Chun Fung, Wah Hung, Guangzhou University Affiliated Middle School, and Red Star, totaling twenty-one teams. In Group A, the strongest contenders are considered to be Eastern, Pui Ying, and Star Island, each boasting numerous strong players. The strength of Chung Sing, Guangzhou, Wah Nam, South China, and University of Hong Kong should not be underestimated. In Group B, Reporter, Li Hang, and Kwan Lui are the strongest teams. The strengths of the other teams are also relatively equal, making the outcome unpredictable.</p>
<p>"Raw iron placed in a furnace will either become steel or slag. Time is the great furnace; humanity is like raw iron being forged. The strong and healthy become steel, while the weak are eliminated as slag. Darwin's principle of 'survival of the fittest' is indeed an immutable law of nature."</p>
<p>If this is true for individuals, it is even more true for nations. Especially now, when [omitted text] is exerting all its power to oppress and subjugate our country. To preserve our territorial integrity and fight for national survival, what other path is there but to strengthen the physical well-being of our citizens and use iron and blood to protect China? Therefore, popularizing national sports is a crucial undertaking that cannot be ignored today.</p>
<p>As a sage once said, "Great undertakings reside in a healthy body." If we can find a real place for entertainment in our spare time to recover from fatigue, what greater joy could there be? Therefore, sports not only benefit the body and mind but also contribute significantly to the development of social undertakings. Furthermore, they foster friendships, promote unity, and lay the foundation for national revival.</p>
<p>Embracing this belief, our association has worked diligently for twelve years. Now, at a time when the nation faces its gravest crisis, coinciding with the launch of our association's twelfth membership drive, the importance of our mission is self-evident. We hope that people from all walks of life will share this vision, uphold the spirit of unity and resistance, concentrate on cohesive organizational groups, train together, plan together, and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia." This is not only the hope of our association members but also crucial to the future of our nation's revival and the most meaningful and effective action we can take now. People from all walks of life, come join us!</p>
<p>Our Slogans:</p>
<p>1.  Popularize sports, use iron and blood to protect China.</p>
<p>2.  Strengthen our bodies to build a strong nation.</p>
<p>3.  Cultivate our genuine forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>4.  Be dedicated to our work and enjoy group life, laying the foundation for national revival.</p>
<p>5.  Everyone join the Eastern Sports Association!" (Po Chun)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Eastern Association Launches Membership Drive, Issues Stimulating Declaration, Hope Compatriots Jointly Participate in the Survival of the Fittest <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Among the Chinese sports organizations in Hong Kong, the Eastern [Association] can be considered to have a considerable history. It has done a lot of work in the sports circles. In recent years, enthusiastic members have worked together to promote the association's affairs, resulting in a trend of steady improvement. Its football team has strived for five months in this year's Group A League and has achieved remarkable results. It can be said that the team has taken the place of the former Chinese [team].</p>
<p>The people in the association are determined to carry out the mission of "saving the country through sports". They will do more work beneficial to the Chinese people from the sports perspective. Therefore, the association has issued a declaration, hoping that compatriots who like sports will join together. Everyone should concentrate on cohesive organizational groups with the spirit of unity and resistance, plan and train, turn weakness into strength, and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia."</p>
<p>The declaration is quite stimulating and moving. I will transcribe it for everyone to read:</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Warrior's Pen <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yang</p>
<p>In this great era facing struggles of blood and fire, "pure talk" and "trivial" literature are no longer permissible. Literature in this era should take on the combat missions assigned by the nation-state. The warrior's pen should be like a double-edged sword, a pistol, directly attacking those inhuman and monstrous creatures, destroying the [omitted text] and striving for the arrival of light in the blood battle. In fact, Zhou Zuoren's "secluded" and "relaxed" approach has sufficiently proven how the train of this era of resistance has abandoned such retreating people. But this is not enough as a lesson from the past. Now, there are still people singing that literature is too "anti-war and stereotyped", "too bloody", that "we should write things unrelated to resistance" and "diluted" things. These literati (or literary literati) want to cover up the current reality of struggle and bloodshed with one hand, completely ignoring the resistance of our compatriots under the [omitted text] massacre. Although their subjective hope is only for entertainment, for "after-tea and after-meal" leisure, objectively, these people are also the kind who wag their tails at the [omitted text].</p>
<p>Comparing the pen to knives and guns is not entirely appropriate. Barbusse's "Fire", Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front", and works like "The Iron Flood" and "The Rout" can be used as millions of sharp weapons to stab the [omitted text]. As far as our war of resistance is concerned, both on the battlefield and in the rear, many combat literatures that match the reality of combat have grown up. Although they do not have the greatness of the above-mentioned works, they are undoubtedly weapons that are fighting hard against the [omitted text] and traitors.</p>
<p>Lu Xun said, "I join the united front, of course, what I use is still a pen, and what I do is still writing articles and translating books, but when this pen is useless, I can believe that I will use other weapons." (Answer to Xu Maoyong about the united front) It can be seen that people who write are not always unable to change to other weapons. As long as they can kill the [omitted text] effectively and help the revolution, pens and knives and guns are the same weapons held by warriors. The ugly creatures in Shanghai and Peiping. The writing warriors will use knives, axes, guns and bullets to sweep them away. The literary literati who are drunk on "peace" cannot see this reality. In their imagination, literature can only provide recreation. No wonder they feel bloody and want to vomit as soon as they smell the atmosphere of literature.</p>
<p>Fascist countries are afraid of literature.

<h3 id="e77">Li Guang, Known as the Flying General <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>—— National Novel Talk——</p>
<p>In the "Yu Chuang Qi Zhen Ji" discovered by the late Ma Lian a few years ago, there is an article "Li Guang, Known as the Flying General", which is almost entirely based on Volume 109 of the Historical Records, "The Biography of General Li", and Volume 54 of the Former Han Book, "The Biography of Li Guang Su Jian". This is indeed a very good tragic story. Li Guang defended against the Huns, but was often unlucky and unsuccessful. Even if he did have merit, it could only be used to offset his crimes. He followed Zhou Yafu to put down the Wu-Chu rebellion, but because he didn't pay enough, he couldn't get the general's seal. He was defeated by the Huns at Shaxi, but because the observing eunuch was shot dead by the Huns, it was considered his crime, and could only be offset against his merits. He attacked the Huns at Yanmen, but was captured by the Huns. Although he escaped, he was demoted to commoner status by the court. All of the above are in the Han history books.</p>
<p>In order to emphasize its tragic nature, the novel added two twists to Li Guang. Li Guang suffered humiliation from the Ba Ling Wei. The Han book said that he reported after execution, and the Han emperor praised him and recorded the original text of the edict. However, the novel said that Li Guang was defeated by the Huns, and the emperor wanted to add an official position. The family of Ba Ling Wei came to the palace to report that Guang had relied on [omitted text] to report, and had nothing but to kill Wei. The emperor was angry, and used the merits to offset the crimes, and became an idle person again." This is one of them. The Han book only says that "Guang's army should have received a reward, but there was no reward." The meaning is that Li Guang "was captured by the enemy, but was able to defeat the enemy, and his merits and demerits were equal." However, the novel says that he "rode the chariot of the Zuo Xian Wang, intending to be unbenevolent, and was questioned by the court." As a result, Zhang Qian interceded, and it was again "merits offsetting the crimes." This is the second.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the story in the historical records that Li Guang followed Wei Qing and Huo Qubing to attack the Huns, got lost and missed the deadline, and committed suicide.</p>
<p>The official history records four instances of "bad luck," while the novel increases it to six. This reminds me of the Romance of Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition, where Xue Rengui's achievements were seized by Zhang Shigui, and he was reduced to a cook, which was also tragic, making readers angry and indignant, and increasing their sympathy. I am also reminded of Yu Dayou, who repeatedly defeated the Japanese pirates, but Gong Wenhuai stole his credit and wanted to question him for his crimes. The most famous is Yue Fei, who was killed by Qin Hui at Fengbo Pavilion.</p>
<p>However, such tragic stories are not needed today, because today is an era of clear politics and strict discipline, with clear rewards and punishments. Just look at the execution of Han Fuqu and Wang Gaonan, the expulsion of Wang Jingwei from the party, and the commemoration of Yan Haiwen and Yao Ziqing, etc., and you can see that the whole country is united to resist foreign aggression. The injustices suffered by Li Guang, Yue Fei, and Yu Dayou will not be seen again in this world. Therefore, when we use historical themes to write chapter novels or Peking operas, we should adopt positive themes, such as "Jiang Tou Bi Xue". Tian Han also expressed the same idea in "The War of Resistance and Drama", and had the same expression at the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Symposium.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Development of Satirical Art in Japan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>From the perspective of human cultural history, the expression of human nature in literature and art undoubtedly first manifests itself in music and painting. Before the appearance of modeling art in the Stone Age and Bronze Age, there were already the most basic music and outlined paintings among the barbarians. This is an unchangeable fact that is evidenced by common human history or archaeological history.</p>
<p>According to the materialistic economic history view, the reason why humans are different from other animals is that humans can manufacture and use production tools. This is an entirely correct view. But phenomenally, the most significant difference between humans and other animals is that humans possess something called "culture". This is the comprehensive crystallization of material and spirit between people.</p>
<p>All animals have emotions, but other than humans, the expression of other animals' emotions can never deviate from the physiological conditions to which they belong: the intertwining of horses' necks and the mutual licking of dogs can all be said to be expressions of their emotions. However, in addition to this physiological emotional expression, humans can also use the objects of third parties to express emotions that cannot be directly explained by physiology. We believe that the origin of all art lies in this.</p>
<p>The art of this object and spiritual crystallization is like the fire that the symbol Prometheus stole to mankind. Once this fire reaches mankind, it will never go out. Even if the barbaric age and the dark age appear alternately in human history, art has always been developing in a curved shape. The generation of satirical art is in the isolated stage of this curved development.</p>
<p>For example, taking the current situation in Japan, under the brutal power of the military, all cultural movements in Japan can be said to have come to a standstill. Cultural movements are originally branches flowing to justice, and justice is as incompatible as fire and water under today's Japanese "national policy". All those engaged in legitimate cultural activities are either abused or thrown into prison. Therefore, recently there has even been a strange phenomenon of a shortage of university professors. What they call "gunmen of literature" are, to put it nicely, hangers-on; to be honest, they are just a group of lackeys who follow the warlords. This is not a malicious scolding, their "articles" are the best proof.</p>
<p>But precisely because Prometheus's spark has been transferred to mankind, the fire can never be extinguished even if the fire is killed for a while. Therefore, although the fascist emperors and warlords exerted great pressure on the activities of various fields of culture, in Japanese literature, there have also appeared works such as Tatsuzo Ishikawa's "Soldiers Are Still Alive". Although Tatsuzo Ishikawa has now expressed "repentance" (as shown in the "Wuhan Battle" published in the January issue of "Central Review"), the activities of folk satirical art are extremely active. In particular, various cartoon paintings targeting the so-called "national mobilization movement" can escape the attention of inspectors and be published in the most popular Japanese newspapers and magazines. Among them, there are several cartoons, and we only need to look at the titles to feel how full of irony they are. For example, on "thrift" (which has a different meaning from the thrift promoted in China), there are "Lighting Alliance", "Smoking Group", and "Garbage National Army", etc., on substitutes, there are "Substitute Team", "Fingernail Pen", and on the people's economic mobilization, there are "Wardrobe Reorganization", "Three Memorial Days", "Implement Family Examples", "Time Consumption Tax", etc. (For the original images, see the reproduced versions of "Magazine" Volume 3, Issues 5, 6, and 16).</p>
<p>Although the territory of Japan is planted with the forest of guns of military fascism, this kind of satirical art is a vine growing in the forest of guns. Although their initial strength is extremely weak, once they spread and grow, they will surround the forest of guns and finally trip it over, clearing a road for the growth and development of the cultural movement of justice.</p>
<p>According to reports, Goebbels in Germany has noticed that satirical art will endanger the existence of fascism, so he decided to put it out, but we firmly believe that Mephistopheles's magic power will ultimately be unable to eliminate Prometheus's torch. The result must be that moths rush to the fire and speed up their own death.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Night of Anpu <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Du Xihui</p>
<p>——A Plague-Ridden Town on the Jinan Road——</p>
<p>After eating dinner at the inn, I wearily lay on the bed to rest for a while. In my mind, it seemed that those terrifying rats were jumping before my eyes, and black, dead corpses were lying horizontally in front of me. What a truly dreadful shadow—I was being tormented and bewildered by this depressing reptile, preventing me from lying down in peace. I ran to the window to gaze at the lovely twilight of the evening outside. Such a beautiful twilight; could I really spend it in such loneliness?</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I locked the door and ran out of the inn, standing on that Zhebai Street. Turning left from the street corner, I saw the large red characters 'Anpu Zhongshan Park'. At the gate, there was a stone bridge leading into the park, beneath which flowed a shallow stream. The stream water made gurgling sounds as it flowed through the ancient mountain rocks. At the end of the stone bridge was a circular pond, in the center of which was a steep artificial mountain covered with verdant greenery. Several evergreen plants were planted on the mountain, and large snails were crawling on the edge of the rocks. I walked along the paved path on the right, on both sides of which were pots full of tulips, hyacinths, marigolds, and beautiful butterfly flowers. A wave of rich jasmine and fragrant rose scents wafted into my nostrils. Walking to the end of a small path flanked by flower beds, I discovered an ancient tomb from hundreds of years ago, with a weathered epitaph tablet next to it. In the verdant pine forest over there, there was also a tennis court covered with fallen leaves and a large pavilion. The park was as desolate and eerie as a tomb, without a single person or the chirping of a bird. Only the sound of lizards underground serenaded this melancholic park, this spring twilight, with a nostalgic serenade.</p>
<p>I quietly walked in the park, repeatedly treading the soft dirt paths, passing through the fragrant flower beds, gazing at the verdant pines and cypresses and the golden hues of the twilight sky, looking at the dilapidated tomb, listening to the monotonous gurgling of the flowing water; my heart was filled with a heroic and melancholic mood. Slowly, I walked out of the park into the darkness.</p>
<p>Walking on the street, it felt as dark as being in a graveyard at midnight. The gray shadows of the houses on both sides were as terrifying as pale tombstones. There were no lights, no human voices, and no barking dogs; only the occasional mournful cry of an owl flying across the starry sky. Terror and all thoughts of death gnawed at my heart, preventing me from lingering on this street. I hurriedly walked back to the inn.</p>
<p>I lit the oil lamp in the room, closed the door again, and sat silently on the bed, my heart still pounding and trembling. I could not say whether it was because of fear or excitement. The weariness of the journey finally overcame my heart, which was immersed in the depths of melancholy. Just as I was staring absentmindedly at the flickering lamplight, I fell asleep in a daze.</p>
<p>Late at night, several dense gunshots suddenly floated over from the street. I woke up from my dream, hearing a burst of chasing and fighting sounds outside. Following that, I heard:</p>
<p>"It's terrible! That person is shooting!..."</p>
<p>"Brothers—chase after him! Catch that traitor!..."! Another round of gunshots followed. With a "miserable cry," the fleeing person was clearly hit and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>"Hit him—hit him—hit the traitor!..."</p>
<p>"Ah, ah, ah—Help!… I…I'm not a traitor!… I…I'm just smuggling!…"</p>
<p>"Damn you! Still saying you're not a traitor!…" Another burst of beatings and "painful..." cries followed.</p>
<p>"Drag him back to the camp." A chaotic jumble of cursing and footsteps mixed together. The sound grew fainter and fainter. The surroundings returned to deathly silence.</p>
<p>Before dawn, the group of people knocked on my door and woke me up. I hurriedly got up, washed my face, put on my clothes, and settled the bill. The porter also helped me carry my luggage to the East Station. The streets were still pitch black, as if shrouded in a plague-ridden haze. The East Station was crowded with a group of travelers hurrying on their way. The porter squeezed in for me to buy a ticket and then helped me put my luggage in the luggage compartment of the train. I rewarded him with two coins. He said "Thank you," and then ran off like a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>As the first glimmer of dawn appeared, our train pulled out of Anpu Station, heading forward along the long southern route. I looked back at the town, which was still shrouded in a layer of azure morning mist. "Goodbye—plague-ridden town!" I silently prayed with a feeling of escaping.</p>
<p>Today's Anpu is where the × people are attempting to land. I hope that the town's plague can grant the greedy imperial army a landing treat!</p>
<p>(The End)</p>
