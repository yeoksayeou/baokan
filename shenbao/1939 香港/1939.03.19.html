<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>中國在保衛世界和平前綫上</h3>
<p>廿個月的日本侵華戰爭，他所得到的是甚麽，事實已經給我們以明白的囘答：就是他們陸空軍戰鬥力三分二的使用與三分一以上的消滅，財政經濟的枯竭，以及士兵和人民普遍的厭戰和反戰。反觀我國，則全國團結的堅固，戰鬥力的增強，後方交通的開發，生產的增加，而尤以全國人民敵愾心的高漲，一切與×人相反。從這裏面注定了我們和×人勝負的前途。所有×人一切虛偽的宣傳，己經掩蓋不了鐵一般的事實，早為世界有識之士所明白指出，無須再詳為解釋。不過日本少數軍閥財閥，究竟要把日本全國人民引到甚麽樣一个悲慘的境地裏，正是我們所關切的問題。</p>
<p>日本少數軍閥財閥，為甚麽要發動這次的侵略戰？我在戰事發生不久以後所發表的「為何而戰」一文，已經明白指出，所有×人一切公開的理由，都不過是欺人之談；而眞正原因，則由於日本軍人的瘋狂心理，錯誤思想所推動，夢想着要實現田中奏摺裏的狂言妄想。田中奏摺所主張，是要征服世界的。不過征服世界，要從征服中國起。可見日本之所以侵華，一切公開的理由，都是虛偽的掩飾，而征服世界，才是他眞正的目的。征服世界，不獨為公理正義所不容；從他本身的人力物力財力各方面看，區區島國，沒有這種力量和資格，是先天注定的。不過日本軍閥的瘋狂心理，驅使着他們不自覺罷了。他們這種瘋狂心理，錯誤思想，雖然先天佳定了不能實現其夢囈，但他們擾亂世界和平，至少擾亂東亞和平，他們是有這種能力的。二十個月以來，我國若千省區之被蹂躪，千千萬萬人民之被殺害，都市交通線之被盤据，財產資源之被刼奪，為有史以來惟一的慘劇。同時各國在遠東商業之被破壞，僑民財產之被刦持，甚至各國在華的使節軍艦，都失去了保障。引起全世界的注意，都集中在東亞這個戰場上。他們所得的結果，雖然證明了他們是在自掘墳墓，但他們的迷夢，並未驚醒。他們錯誤的思想。也並未改正。從上月，日本要不顧一切，向海南島進攻，就足以證明他是在做進一步的冒險，而做孤注之一擲了。</p>
<p>海南島為我國雷州半島外的一個孤島，與大陸上的戰局無關。如果說日本的侵華戰，是限於征服中國，則應該在大陸上决勝負。大陸上的戰局，因為用不着海軍，所以自戰事開始到現在，日本戰鬥力的損失，還偏重於陸空軍方面。海軍的精銳，還保存着。陸空軍在大陸上旣已遇見堅強的勁敵，不能償其所願；根據他征服世界一貫的方針，不得不用他最後的海軍向世界進攻了，海南島的位置，西接安南，北接廣州灣，隔南海與菲律濱相對峙，旣足以控制南海與東京灣，而威脅安南和菲律濱；並切斷香港和新加坡的航路，足以左右整個的西太平洋形勢。從日本的觀點說，自庫頁島經過日本的本部和台灣，海南島正是日本南向的總門戶。當美國在關島設防的聲中，日本佔領海南島的舉動，無異於給美國以行動上的答復，無異於明白告訴美國，自檀香山以西，新加坡以東，早已是日本計劃中的領域了。蔣委員長在日本進攻海南島之翌日，明白指出日本之進攻海南島，『無異於太平洋上之九一八』，一句話把日本征服世界的野心，可謂說得透闢無餘。在從前田中奏摺被發現的時侯，一般人雖然驚駭，但總認為不過是一種狂言。九一八事伴發生，居然燒起遠東的烽火，淺見者仍認為是遠東地方事件，不加注意。蘆溝橋事變發生，世界上仍然有不少國家在觀望着。到了現階段，日本的猙獰面目，可謂完全暴露了。從行動上告訴世界，他侵略中國，是征服世界的第一節目。</p>
<p>我們中國二十個月以來的英勇抵抗，無疑地是為了中華民國的獨立，和中華民族的自由生存。然而就整個的世界說，也正是担任保障世界和平的前哨。世界需要和平，從前次歐戰裏，各國已經得到普遍的教訓。國際聯盟的組織，非戰公約的簽訂，都是為避免戰爭的殘酷而設。但少數野心家的企圖，則非驅使人類流血不快意。現在世界上蓄意製造戰爭的，固然不止日本一國。然而第一次槍聲，則從日本所製造的九一八起。當時我國因為內部問題，雖然沒有力量抵抗；但如果世界各國都能放長眼光，主持公道。以後的形勢必不至如此惡化。甚至凡爾塞條約也不至於被撕毀，阿比西尼亞也不至於被滅亡，而西班牙兩年多的內戰，更不致於發生。我們知道，野心家是有會滿足的。九一八事變，中國不放一槍一彈，而放棄了東北四省之不能滿足日本，猶之乎歐洲各國犧牲了奧國捷克，西班牙和阿此西尼亞之不能滿足德意。問題祇有愈逼愈緊。惟與以實力的抵抗，或愛好和平的國家聯合起來與以有效的制裁，才能發生實際效力。蘆溝橋事變以來的中日長期戰，旣已予日本野心家以最合理的囘答；而德意無饜的要求，也已經引起歐美各國普遍的醒悟。最近如英法，英美之間，密切合作，已經開端，正足與德意以相當的警戒。不過我們所不可忽略的，世界上幾個野心家，正在進行聯合。雖然他們之間，含有不少的矛盾，但至少可以互相呼應。因此世界上愛好和平的國家，終有聯合的必要。惟有聯合起來，才能根本消滅野心家各個擊破的企圖。在這種希望的聯合裏，無疑地仍由我們中國担任最前線。</p>
<p>在歐洲，德意之所以橫行，可以說他們完全利用歐洲人的畏戰心理。因為上次大戰的教訓，還深印在一般人的腦筋裏。所以德意之所以能獲得勝利，一半是出於威脅，一半是出於詐騙。而在遠東，日本自維新以後，中日，日俄兩戰，都僥倖獲勝，釀成他們狂妄的心理，早已目中無人。不予以嚴重的打擊，是不會覺悟的。田中奏摺裏征服世界的狂言，就是因此而生。我們中國旣為日本心野家征服世界的第一目標，我國土地之大，物產之多，人力之足，本足以抵抗日本而有餘。從過去二十个月的戰績，己經可以證明。不過為縮短戰事的過程，減少殘酷的犧牲，世界上愛好和平的國家，有及早聯合之必要的。這種聯合，以我們可以說，援助中國，雖然是直接的目的，而為維護世界和平，保障各國自身的安全，各國都負有同樣的義務的。過去各國牽於事實，在道義上雖已對我國給予很多同情，而行動上尙未能趨於一致。最近如英美等國，對遠東關係比較密切的，都已漸趨一致，足以予我國以很大的興奮。現在日本野心家，更進一步實行其征服世界的第二个步驟了。所以我們不得不明白指出日本的野心，而進一步希望世界各國為其自身的安全而努力，以共同撲滅這个世界和平的破壞者。</p>
<p>蔣百里先生說：「世界上沒有像我那樣同情於日本人的」。我以為這應該是每一個人道主義者共有的感想。日本在種種條件上，不但沒有征服世界的資格，不但不應該妄以東亞主人翁自居，並且應該非常謹愼地安居在他的島國上。何幸而為日本人，立國於中蘇美三大愛好和平的國家之間。他竟不知滿足，發動這次大規模的侵略戰。二十個月的戰爭裏，使用了他陸空軍三分之二並消耗了他陸空軍三分一的力量；如果知難而退，或者尙不難保持着他在東亞小國的地位。我們所給予他最合理的敎訓，他應該深深感謝。不想他現在更進一步，以他僅存的海軍，向西太平洋伸出他的魔手。當現在世界和平力量日趨團結的今日，他的前途，是難於想像了。我想在不久的將來，他會更進一步，深深地後悔，他不應該不領受我們中國所給予他的敎訓！</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從三月十二日至十八日</p>
<p>緊張！嚴重！危急！混亂！</p>
<p>痛哭！號咷！怒罵！歡呼！</p>
<p>歷史的悲劇！人類的恥辱！</p>
<p>過去一週，可算是新年以來國際時局最嚴重最混亂的一週　在歐洲，捷克共和國因放棄抗戰中途妥協而全部淪亡，德國　略者勢焰更加高漲，英法各地處境更加危險，而蘇聯和美國所號召的「聯合起來，保衞民主與和平」的聲浪，亦在瀰漫全歐戰雲中獲得廣泛的饗應。在遠東，日本侵略者窺伺西方時局之嚴重乘機實行「混水裏捉魚」，他一面造戍一種「大舉進攻蘇聯的形勢，一面加緊進攻西南征服全華的準備，至於我國，在這纷亂的世界上，在「堅強國結持久抗戰，的共同要求下，繼續軍事政治民運各方面的進步，困難雖仍嚴重，前途却更光明。</p>
<p>捷克全部瀹亡</p>
<p>捷克斯拉夫是歐洲大戰後新興的共和國家，係合舊奧匈帝國的波希米亞，摩拉維亞，西里西亞，斯洛伐克，羅孫尼亞各部而成，面積十四萬三百餘方公里，人口約一千四百七，二萬八千。外交向　法國之馬首是瞻，一面和羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫締結約定，所謂小協約國，用以鞏固國際地位。但是去年九月慕尼黑協定成立，法國達拉第政府追隨張伯倫妥協政策，竟以分割捷克來換取德國侵略者關於歐　和平的保證，南羅等小國更早以此所依附的法國政策的動搖而惶駭不安自　不暇，捷克政府又鎭壓人民抗戰熱潮，接受國際訓解實行中途妥協。當時捷克給圖名義上的獨立。但一切妥協政策，徒自招致滅亡。德國侵略者眼看西班牙抗戰已在英法妥協政策下漸將鎮壓下去。便卽乘機中進，軍事動員與外交陰謀同時並進，撕破羅瀋未乾的『保証捷克獨立』的慕尼黑協定，而有本月十五日不戰以亡捷克的歷史的悲劇。</p>
<p>十五日希特勒煊赫入捷京，十六日卽發宣言倂呑捷克。現在「捷克』的現狀是：（一）斯洛伐克區宣佈『獨立』，實際上是成為德國的附庸，一個歐洲的偽滿洲國，一切均受德國侵略者的支配。（二）羅孫尼亞區亦已宣佈『獨立』，但仍在匈斯兩軍的爭奪中，波蘭亦有業一出　的消息，假如為匈牙利仿呑，則匈波接境，須視意德關係。而定其阻止德軍直接衝突可　性，（三）捷克所剩兩富裕省份波希米亞，摩拉給亞，實際』成德國屬省，軍事政治財政悉由德國委任專員主持，並卽　行紐倫堡猶太法。捷克共和國至此便已全部淪亡了。我們在這裏希望一般喜見「反共」主和』「中途妥協」和『國際調解』之論的同胞，拭目以看捷克共和國在「反共』「主和　中途妥協」『國際調解』政策下亡國的痛史！</p>
<p>英法美兵新動態</p>
<p>由西班牙戰局激變到捷克共和國淪亡，一面造成了法西斯侵略者德意兩國更優異的聲勞，一面又逼使英法等民主和平國家在世界的地位更加降落。同時又使全世界反法西斯反侵略的鬥爭，便提前到激劇發展的階段，民主和平陣綫被逼着鞏固起來，擴展起來。英法兩國，代表勤勞大衆的政黨，廣大求自由的民衆，一致反對帮助侵略者禍人害己的妥協政策，從議會利示威巡行中，廣泛展開實際鬥爭。英法政府，亦逼得採取較强硬態度，十七日倫敦電稱英法已同意召回兩國駐德大使，表示對於德國毀約的抗議。張伯倫亦不得不於十七日在伯明罕大聲斥責德國危害和平，英决盡力以抗敵人之挑戰；而哈立法克斯亦謀組織一國民內閣，號召各黨派參加，將包括前外相艾登及保守黨邱吉爾等，同時政府對於施行征兵制以强化英國對德態度的提議，亦有同情表示。而張伯倫即將辭職與促進英國與蘇聯邦交的消息已紛至杳來。法國方面，共產黨社會黨領導的反法西斯反侵略人民陣綫獲有新的發展，達拉第决於日內赴英會商應付新危機局面，法外長龐納亦宣稱法國今日應與蘇聯及波蘭維推密切關係，他曾與蘇大使屢次磋商，波蘭亦屢有促英法與蘇聯合作的表示。至於美國，自德國倂捷消息傳到後，政界對於國際戰雲，更抱不安，羅斯福總統加强和平陣綫反抗法西斯侵略的態度則更加强硬，國務副卿威爾斯十七日正式宣示美國痛擊德國侵略暴行的决意，參議院反對政府的態度漸表軟弱。衆院勞工委會主席提議取消爭捷商約，及要求德國負担捷克所欠一億六千五百萬元巨額債款。軍事上除二萬萬七千萬元增建巴　馬運河水閥案外，羅斯福又將向國會提議支撥五百萬元發展關島港口防務。這些事實可以證明民主和平各國已有進一步的黨醒與團結抵抗法西斯的侵略的傾向，我們今日的任務就在號召與統一全世界反法西斯的羣衆力量，促進英法政府與美蘇聯合的政策，而防制其限於絲和國內反對情緒的企圖。</p>
<p>蘇日衝突嚴重</p>
<p>當此歐洲局勢危急萬分之際，蘇日關係亦是空前緊張。過去蘇日衝突的根本原因，不是共產主義，而是日×一種陰謀藉以緩和國內反戰情緒，緩和列强制日運動，轉移我國抗日視線，而遂行其加緊征服我國的步驟。這次蘇日漁區糾紛，實際十蘇聯方面理直氣壯，日方固有和平誠意，早就可以解决，但正因為日×具有十述陰謀，所以繼續保持着緊張的狀態。不過自本月十五日起，蘇聯已經秉持保衞和平止義的强硬態度，拒絕×一切無理要求，實行拍賣庫頁島漁權了。日本非作戰則屈服，冉不能繼續其過去陰謀了。據連日電訊，日×已在造成「對蘇作戰」形勢，據十七日上海外電，謂最近由日本朝鮮及開往「滿洲」的日軍。日來源源運行北滿，約計兵力　萬左右，接近張鼓　之清律港，已宣佈禁止商船出入，北滿鉄路由哈爾濱至滿州里一段，已被自動破壞。據另一外國情報，則謂最近兩星期來，秘密自中國撤退而開往滿洲的日軍，已達六十萬人左右。近來中國各戰區內日空軍大為活動，其目的卽係掩護運隊退却云云。我們對於這種消息，在無事實證明以前，必須堅持保留態度。同時我們應有如下的基本認識：（一）日×全力侵華軍事，已無勝利把握，决無同時進行對華對蘇戰爭的力。（二）蘇聯政治經濟飛羅進步是軍事上足以戰勝任何侵略者的保證。遠東紅軍富力在張鼓峯抗日之役已有偉大表現，其後數月來進步尤為神速，本月十六日蘇聯遠東軍總司令施特恩在聯共大會報吿，更證明遠東令施特恩在聯共大會報告，更證明遠東紅軍素　，在任何方面俱較日軍為侵。日×侵華未勝之前；决無眞正對蘇作戰的胆量與决心。（三）蘇聯近來對日强硬態度及遠東雄厚實力，實為我國抗日戰爭最有力的援助；我們未可輕信近來們急應乘此時　從戰略上加緊強化前綫的戰鬥力和×後游擊戰的大規模的發動。（四）我們還要注意日×揚言不惜對蘇作戰，而實際上却渴望對蘇糾粉和解炎際。警備其對華尤其是對西南的新攻略，警備其軍事上總攻的準備和政治上和平妥協的陰謀。</p>
<p>一週抗戰情勢</p>
<p>最近一週來的抗日戰爭，大局還是沒有重要的變化。第一，一度緊張的鄂中戰事，經我軍於上週開始向×軍冀側反攻以來，×勢即趨疲弱，僅京鍾路上之空前血戰，日軍死亡已達八千以上，我軍雖退出鍾祥，但隨卽增到援隊，大舉反攻，將鍾祥嚴密包圍，並派軍四師繞鍾祥之北，擾×後路。雙方繼續對時。第二長江以南×現續　自浙皖鋤我浙湘路，南取南昌長沙，惟無進展。鄱陽湖以東，連日激戰，迄求停止；西岸南潯路至修河以北地區，不斷遭我游擊隊懲創。第三，北方戰况，亦在對峙狀態×軍三路佔奪靜樂，進犯西北計劃，又已被我擊破。一因我實行堅壁淸野策略收效顯著，二因×軍後路受襲後援不繼，三干部眾，先後被殲千餘；現我士氣益為旺盛。至於由汾陽太原陽曲三路西犯之×，經我自後路反攻之下，亦已頓挫。其餘察秘魯豫續有混戰，蘇北經我反攻之後，淮陰情况不明，×軍聲勢又衰，而黑龍　主席馬占山，則已率訓練新成之東省騎　三萬，自綏遠出發「東征』，準備打回黑龍江去就職：士氣如雲，所向無敵，現抵熱河西境，除一路偽軍望風來歸以外，竟未遭遇抵抗！第四，華南方面一週以來；形勢特較緊張，此事國與英法在歐洲的退護妥協政繁有關，授日×以進一步嚇詐豪奪的機會，據十六日紹關我軍情報，華南×軍將領近在某處會議，擬繼增三個師團到事，進犯南路，並準備應付因侵海南島可能引起的國際問題。又據桂林方面軍報，則稱×軍近有圖犯陽江電白企圖，事南大戰迫在眉睫。至就各綫戰况而霄，則海南島方面我駐軍仍在艱苦抗戰，從前的紅軍於央勇抗×之外並已積極動員民衆，訓練黎苗，作持久抗戰準備，以便配合全面抗戰；消耗及牽制×軍。廣東境內，×在佔領區仍舊僅守點綫，近雖力謀逐區消滅我游擊隊，並利用注精衞等反共主和言論。散發注在港發行的××日報，及其他主和反共的漢奸刊物。以輔助其毒辣的懷柔政策，以便鞏固其統治權，便利其用偽法令徵發錢物抽調壯丁婦女。但因我政治工作亦漸伸入淪陷區，鋤奸運動日有進展，×在四月以來，毫無進展。最近所以積極動作，大約就在企圖以軍事進攻挽救其政治的失敗，願誤信在太陽旗下同有太平日子過的華南同胞，就此警覺起來。</p>
<p>重要軍事會議</p>
<p>抗戰轉向第一階設以來我軍與×軍的形勢，已經開始重大的變化，×人方面，為了擊破我們的持久戰略，一面在政治上加緊指揮民族叛徒親日份子推進「反共」「主和」的言論行動，以離間我團結，消沉我×愾，一面在經濟上懷柔與豪奪，兩策齊下，加緊向佔領區內刦奪；在軍事方面仆改變作戰方針，從中心城市改以我們的軍隊作為他們作戰目標；這是因為（一）×人兵力太少，不能稱我整個擊破；（二）年半作戰經騐，証明中國人卽在×人姦淫，擄掠，屠殺之下亦難屈服，故企圖把我主力擊破；（三）年半作戰經騐證明非佔領廣大鄕村，决不能使我屈服，故企圖到處找我軍隊打、肅淸其後方，恢復以華制華毒計，利用我國人來繼續進攻征服我國。針對×人這種陰謀，可知我們一定要發展×人後方的游擊戰爭，才能停止×人的進攻：只有停止×人的進攻，我們才能培植新力量準備反攻進行决戰，也只有實行反攻進行決戰，才能復土建國。為了新的環境與新的需要，我們會於最近召集一次高級軍事會議，據主持這次會議的某主任說，這次會綫在積極方面决定，以全面主軌戰的精密戰術，及効死的精神，到×人前綫和後方，加緊撻伐日×的步驟。軍事上决定勇猛擊潰×軍主力，同時實行國民公約方法，粉碎日×政治詭計，然後以經濟及封鎖辨法，不許×商品運入內地，并不許我糧品運入×　領區，消極方面則在重政治文化各種力量的鞏固，以期配合至面的革命戰術。政　上决定加强各級政治機構，及鞏固戰區內革命政治機構，以使發動廣大民衆抗戰力量。文化上决定加增抗戰文化工作，發揚民族精神，以便提高革命情緒。人事上决定先賢任能。繼理上抉定廉潔奉公。最後並制定帶兵練兵及用兵的簡德有効的辦法。經過這次軍事會議之後，對于整個抗戰前途。自有重要的進展。「詳評請參閱本月十五日本報專論「喻抗戰軍事新决定」同時為使動員全國豺政金融經濟力量以為抗戰服務起見。最近又有全國金融會議的召集與圓滿結束，成立金融界的抗日統一戰綫積極為實現抗戰建國時期的財政經濟政策而努力。（請參閱本月十七日本報社評「目前財政金融經濟問題』。）</p>
<p>國民精神動員</p>
<p>高度的發　民族自尊心與自信心，堅持抗戰到底，克服悲觀情緒，反對妥協企圖；和擁護最高領袖，擁戰中央政府，擁謢國共合作，反對分歧與分裂，反對任何的漢奸政府：是目前階段制止×人進攻，準備我軍反攻。以爭取抗戰最後勝利的全民族的緊急任務。蔣委員長特於本月十二日（東方民族革命之父——中山先生逝世紀念日），通電全國，號召中華兒女。」致實行精神動員，誓行國民公約，當然就是在求全國一致担負起當前的緊急任務。中央頒發的國民精神總動員綱領及其實施辦法，各報均有刊載，特舉國民人人所易知易行的簡單而明三個共同目標：（一）國家至上民族至上，（二）軍事第一勝利第一，（三）意志集中力　集中，以促國人一致接受，改正醉生夢死的生活，養成奮發蓬勃的朝氣，革除苟月偷生的習性打破自私自利的企圖，糾正紛岐錯雜的思想，不違反革命的三民主義最高原則）而舉全國人人之心力以献攻於抗戰建國事業日及各地各界紛起響應，使人感到國家民族遠大與光明的前途。不過為期眞正過到全　挨一切生動力量，切實集中服務于抗戰建國事業，我們認為第一尙　加緊實行集中領導的民主政后，以便政府與民衆的聯系更加密切，而發揮抗日政府的最大力量，全國唯一民意機關的國民　政會，，舉行三次大會的偉大成就，己可打破少數政府中人及一般國民對於該會的冷淡態度，而公認足以動員全民力量，協助政府，爭取抗戰勝利；奠立建設三民丰義新中國民主政治的基礎。日前更應使各省市參議會儘速建立起來，成為各地方的眞正民意機關，發揚國參會的精神，完成抗戰建國大業。第二，還須擴大和統一各種民衆運動，主要的是保障一切抗日民衆　體民衆運動的自由，確立比衆豐體在法律上的地方：認　創立　農靑年婦女商人及文化界等等為抗戰建國而服務的團體，並　照地域或職業，聯合起來，統一起來，在政府領導之下，盡全力援助抗戰國建。</p>
<h3>日本自由主義者的沒落（三）</h3>
<p>— 賀塞爾原著</p>
<p>原文載「亞細亞雜誌」</p>
<p>他們得到了皇室的援助，說不定連軍部也得受他們的指揮。現在日本的陸　兩相固然要在現役車人中遴選，並且事先要取得海陸續兩方面的回意，但日本天皇也不一定對他們所提的任何人都得批准。因此，以一般自由主義者在議會的面所有的台法力量，再加上他們在政府內外以及天皇旁邊的潛勢力，要打破現在軍人警察統治的局面也非難事。</p>
<p>暗潮的輪鄭大致如此，但不一定就有實現的希望。他們一遇到法西斯頑固派的攻擊，便不戰而退，有的跑到鄉裏去了，有的則關起門來一聲不響。上次國會的辯論會也不遜為了面子問題，他們僅管在會議場上發表激昂慷慨的演詞，但人人都知道，只要政府執定非通過預算不可，他們也便得通過。結果是眞的通過了。</p>
<p>但他們這一種退却也不是這樣簡單。我們不能希望一般智識界的人和軍人警察打架。假如眞有幾個年高停劭的人拿了生銹的手槍來開幾響，自然也够轟傳一世，　那與自殺何異？自由主義者的武器，在日本和其他各地都是一樣，根本就不是力和槍。</p>
<p>一個日本的智識份子，顯然受過國際思想的薰陶，和外人有不斷的接觸，或者在世界各地遊歷過，但他總還有一個日本人。他的民族的特質是沒有方法改變的。盧梭，托亦斯泰，和馬克　這各人，只搔得着他的皮膚，卻不能改變他的氣焰。在紐約遇着一個日本半官式的宣傳家，或者一個日本商務考察團的領袖，你可以把他當做加外一個人。因為他一回到日本又在那里對着千百的偶像或絲　的神佛鞠躬了，他如一旦當了又員的時候，他會立刻跑到神社裏去祭告。一回家又讀起瑪爾諾新出版的小說來了。他有這些活動，自己並不覺得滑稽、但這一種雙重主義，時刻游離於兩　精神生活的極端，却始終使一個日本的自由主義者　入了苦　。</p>
<p>日本現在正拚命的恢復明治以前的思想，這和自由主義當然　背道而馳。兩種思想旣無法調和，結果是自由主義掩旗息鼓。現在日本的自由主義者實際上已成為所謂和和派了。他們以為　却不一定　是絕望。他們仍舊希望實現他們的思想，但現在全國的統一好　那樣重要的時候，要他們和法西斯敵人鬥爭，那也是辦到的。</p>
<p>日本的軍人現在正發了狂，就只有一般自由主義者的頭腦還淸醒一點，這時候正需要他們出來擔當一切，擔當鑄造日本將來的責任，但他們却放棄了這種權利。在我們外界的人有起來，他們是失掉了歷中的使命。將來日本的人民，新烯起自由和生活幸福的希望，在刺刀後面揭竿而起的時候，他們是不會再要求自由主義者出來領導的了。（完）</p>

<h3>從沙市到襄樊</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>汽車在沙市　賤價補充够了來回的食　——汽油，　在一個殘雪未消，陰雲四合的早晨，發勢洪蕩地向鄂北襄獎出發。聽說襄樊水菓很貴，沙市一元買五六十個的川橘，刊那里可賣一角一個。司機就買了很多川橘塞在車上，想去發一筆構財。無如汽車載　逾　，不斷『楚楚』地發出呼籲聲，把參客們都弄得心慈意軟，料定牠遲早就要累出毛病來。</p>
<p>駛行十餘甲，卽抵荆州（江陵），車從東門入，旋從北門出。看那高厚巍峨的城牆，紆迴碧綠的壕水，襯上許多生龍活虎般的守兵，這古城顯然已充分準備着也許要它發揮　歷史上光榮的抗×攘夷的偉力了。城中滿街桐樓楊柳，到處荷構綠　；惟汽車所經一角，却是荒凉草地。三國時屬漢名將關公　守荆州，先以善戰懾服吳魏，繼以　態　悮戎機，引為千古讀史之憾事。現『關帝廟』還保存有他的一件遺　——　帶；『承天寺』有一口大鍋，直徑長達丈餘，據說也　當年關公軍用之物。兩寺住持，大事宣傳神靈，向來香火都很旺，抗戰後前往膜拜祈禱者尤眾。可是該城亦慘被×機轟炸一次，計死傷平民二十餘人。足見虛無縹渺的神靈，實不能作戰爭傷害的現實誌佑。一般迷信神靈的同胞們，應該澈底覺悟：快將敬鬼神敬天地的誠心，移來去敬前線抗戰的英勇戰士！把敬神靈買香燭，鞭炮，牲體的金錢，移來去買槍砲子彈打×軍！這才眞正是保本身保子孫的現實辦法啊！</p>
<p>行抵荆門，停車吃飯。當遇甫從前線歸來的×××師參謀蔣××氏，據談鄂中戰况，略謂：『鄂中××，頻頻西犯，其目的在擴大平漢警衞線，鞏固京山帛市防守各據點，防我游擊隊襲擊，以及大軍反攻。惟彼兵力有限，遇我分頭迎擊，倘不潰退，即呈膠着　態，中如岳口天門各地，入春以來，×我傾力爭奪，得失不下數次。我軍多是新銳之師，每戰氣勢至勇，雖不免有所犧牲，然絕能阻×　進。」最近鄂中戰局的全貌，蔣氏可謂概說無餘了。</p>
<p>再前行二十里，在南橋附近小坡，汽車果不出晨間所料：竟向　機請病假——走了！　機在雪風中呵手修理；修了兩個鐘頭都不成功。不能久耐寒風砭骨的乘客們，便一唱衆和地向司機開始作反面的一歌功誦德」了！</p>
<p>那時從前線剛抬到二三十位負着榮譽創傷的戰士，他們顫威威地睡在老百姓用綠竹麻繩稻草做成的擔架隊上，在創　和嚴寒交攻之下，竟虧待得他們連呻吟都喊不出聲音來。他們在前方這樣的為國流血，掛着彩下來又要這樣的受寒受苦，我們在後方衣暖食飽的同胞們，難道眞的會縣毫無動干衷麼？</p>
<p>誰知我們那位司機先生，他幷未利令智昏，當時目睹傷兵慘狀，慨然捐出——川橘兩簍，另託一位「老鄕」重甸甸地担着和　兵担架隊一路去了。那夜因申修好太晚，便在南橋任宿，但乘客反無任何怨言，蓋先時對司機恨不能「鳴鼓而攻之」的那番公憤，已早奉陪着那担重甸　的川橘欣然而去了，雖然汽車的載重，幷不因此而得到過度的輕鬆。</p>
<p>在小坡上修車的時候，遙見南橋鎭有很多車隊在操絲；薄暮入鎭尋住屋，却不見一兵一卒。後來觀罕明白，此中自有奧妙，在這裏若要勉强說破，僅有一宿營進步一四字奉吿。</p>
<p>鎭上的老百姓，他們從眼前現實的×軍×行中，已獲得不少的寶貴敎訓。和他們閒跌，有的對我說：『這囘打仗，和從前自家人爭江山不同，只許勝，不許敗，若結局算是敗仗，那可不得了！我們的田產　屋，非全數給日本×永久佔去不可。不過——不過就是我們傢伙有點兒差。』</p>
<p>『那有什麽了不得的關係！』另一個搶着說：『像先生們（指記者）今日的汽車在小坡上出毛病，修的修，凑的凑，終歸會開釗坡頭上來，若半坡鬆手，汽車還要壓傷自己人。××傢伙雖然厲害些：但現在我們不拚命把他打敗，以後才更不得了！』言下頗有『為虺弗摧，為　將若何」之槪。</p>
<p>有的吿訴我說：我們隊伍是怎樣的好法，如吃了糧食，則照數給錢；替他們担東西，運傷兵。每天五毫大洋不少一子…——這些聽來好似家常便飯，實際倒是軍民合作，必可制勝的一大鉄證哩！</p>
<p>翌晨啓行，過宜城，停車片刻，仍繼續北進，干午後四時到襄陽。渡襄河（卽漢水）赴樊、輪渡上的頭領說：每天輪渡時間，規定自頭大下午×點鐘起，至習成×點修止；餘時因防空襲停止輪渡。單人來往，可備甩小舟。他又說；平時操舟為業非常怕軍差。現在是他自己請求來替國難服務的，『上面』知道他水性熱，不嫌他是五十多歲的　漢。還發給全身甲衣和大衣，和年靑弟兄一模一樣做救國工作，他覺得是平生最有面子的事。輪渡駛至對岸，回翻又見韓國　勇隊寫在襄陽城義上的大字標語：『中韓民族聯合起來！』眞　人精神興奮。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>××滬市各界的籲請</h3>
<p>十八日上海美聯社來電，謂上海各界團體聯合致電重慶，籲請國府對於上海公共租界及法租界中國居民之權利被剝奪事，向英法美當局提出抗議。我們於上海同胞這種迫急的籲請，急應表示熱烈的共鳴，並求其早日獲得應有的成功。</p>
<p>不過我們還應注意以下幾點：第一，日本侵略中國，眞正受害者除了中國人民以外，英美法各國在遠東權益亦遭受非常嚴重的損害，特別是英法兩國在歐洲實行對德意侵略者退讓的妥協政策以來，更授日×以在遠東得寸准尺大肆猖狂的機會，最近日×壓迫上海租界，便是最明顯的　行之一，因此我們要指出這是英法妥協政策的結果，英法急須放棄此種政策，始能保全其在遠東的權益，否則任何對×人的退讓妥協，除了替侵略者服務以外，得到的將只有增加自身苦難的枷鎖！</p>
<p>第二，日×壓迫上海租界當局剝奪我同胞權利的最新事實，一是中山先生逝世紀念日，法租界同胞舉行升半旗禮，竟遭干涉：二是和界當局准許日軍在公共租界及法租界搜捕我同胞，我們在這裏應該指出（一）租界當局剝奪我同胞應有權利的行為，已經違反租界條例，（二）租界當局犯有對我國家不敬的非法行為的嫌疑；（三）租界當局有庇護日軍在租界內非法行為的嫌疑。</p>
<p>第三，我們相信上海租界最近迭次剝奪我同胞權利的不幸事件，决非租界當局的本意，更非英美法各友邦所忍聽聞，因此我們一面要求英美法各友邦迅速澈查上海租界此種事件之根因，而予以嚴正的處斷，俾我居　上海同胞，得享受其應有的權利；一方面我們還要防止一切仇視任何友邦的情緒的發展，以免為×人陰謀所中！</p>
<p>第四，希望政府對於上海租界壓迫我同胞的不幸事件，接受滬市各界團體的翻請，向英美法提出嚴重抗議，要求迅作公正解决；同時希望全嚴及海外與論界，一致予以注視，盡力喚起國際正義人士。同情我們的籲請，一致要求其政府，俾獲澈底的解决。</p>
<h3>捷克瓜分後　德匈會妥協嗎？（上）</h3>
<p>— 董平鐸</p>
<p>匃攫盧森尼亞的內幕</p>
<p>掩克是被分割了，德國的噬呑，原非一紙「慕尼黑協定」所能制止，這是誰都明白的。可是，匈牙利也趁火打刦，擾去了喀巴什烏克蘭——卻盧森尼亞，又名小俄羅斯——似乎頗令人有非意料所及之感。但事實的發生，决不是偶然的，一切目有它的背景與演變。</p>
<p>遠在帝俄時代，全部的烏克蘭土地，是分隸在奧匈帝國及帝俄的統治之下。那時的烏克蘭人早醞釀着獨立運動，這自非帝俄所能允許，常常大肆逮捕，發配西伯利亞。所以，許多烏克蘭領袖都逃至奧匈帝國的烏克蘭境界，在那裏設立「烏克蘭情報局」，專事進行反俄活動。</p>
<p>帝俄推翻，布爾希維克上台，烏克蘭的獨立份子認為機會已到，便組成了一個「建烏滅俄聯合會」。遷進了俄領烏克蘭，在基非成立一個「中央委員會』，宣佈烏克蘭獨立。他們這種舉動，受到許多反共份子勢力的支持。</p>
<p>但，自然，蘇聯是不肯失去這塊肥美的烏克蘭的；於是，便以武力反攻，但給侵入的德奧聯軍擊敗了。德奧聯軍便這樣地保護了烏克蘭獨立，支持哥薩克將軍斯柯羅柏的斯基氏担任領袖。</p>
<p>大戰吿終，德奧戰敗，斯氏不得不下台，換一個與協約國較接近的人物，那便是惡魔帕吉拉。</p>
<p>帕吉拉的開塲，是很煊赫的：他發表宣言，，宣佈羅領溩克蘭與奧匈帝國領的烏蘭克聯合；在他的新烏克蘭國家計劃中，計包括加里西亞，布哥維亞，比塞拉比亞及喀巴什。</p>
<p>帕吉拉的恐怖虐政，現在的烏克蘭人囘憶起來，猶有餘悸。他的殘酷與暴虐遠在希特勒之上，同樣的，他也是惆虐猶狂者；擁着極大的軍隊，專事酷虐猶太居民。</p>
<p>後來，帕吉拉終於伏法了，他的大溩克蘭迷夢瓦解，流亡在巴黎，一九三六年給一個波籍猶太詩人以手搶擊斃。那兇手叫斯華茨巴，他在法庭上說：「我的十二個近親，都是死在他手下的」。於是，全法國都說：「犯罪不是兇手，是被殺者。」結果，這個勇士自由了。</p>
<p>帕吉拉是這樣的死了，他的烏克蘭獨立夢，也老早死了。那時的烏克蘭人，已很少冉想到要獨立。</p>
<p>蘇聯立刻又把舊俄領烏克蘭攫了回去，和約的結果，西部的烏克蘭給了波蘭；比塞拉比亞及布哥維亞送了羅馬尼亞；原在匈牙利手中的喀巴什烏克蘭，便割給了捷克斯洛伐克，這樣，帕吉拉的大烏克蘭夢，是瓜分給了五個國家：蘇，波，捷，羅及匈。</p>
<p>其實，如果希特勒不起覬戲之念，烏克蘭的問題便可以算吿一結束了。但希特勒登台之後，是竭力支持烏克蘭獨立計劃的，因為，只有那樣，他才能自蘇聯獲得富庶的二克蘭，進而瓜分波蘭與征服捷克斯洛伐克。</p>
<p>希特勒自然仍用着納粹的老法門，他發見現在依然有着少數的，克蘭人，在慷，着他們祖國的獨立。把他們組織起來，成一支有用的嘍囉，自然是很容易的。於是，在但澤。一個「溩克蘭籌備獨立中央委員會」成立起來，由一個帝俄時代的　克蘭軍將呌齊林期基的主持。</p>
<p>這個「中央委員會」立刻開始工作，在彼蘭大肆煽動烏克蘭人。同時，組織烏克蘭衝鋒隊，一切是仿的德國：不過，把褐色制服，換成淡綠，名字改成「西塞衞隊」（Siczy　Grards）。</p>
<p>在先，齊林斯基進行這種工作，完全是秘密的，因為那時的德，波，還算互維友好關係。但到最近，一切都揭開了，慕尼黑協定之後，西克賽衞隊便正式担任了喀巴什烏克蘭的警務。</p>
<p>於是，齊杜斯基便把「中央委員會」搬到許士特——bust）喀巴什　克蘭的首都，大烏克蘭運動的支柱點——在德國實力支持與經濟援助之下，承秉希勒特的命令，負責領導大烏克蘭運動。</p>
<p>同時，希特勒故技復施，在柏林設立烏克蘭總部。任命一個舊帕吉拉部下軍官叫蘇斯區　的做領袖；組織了許多暗殺團，派赴波蘭及蘇聯境內，大肆活動，事件迭起，他們携帶着靑黃二色的旗幟，跟齊林斯基在許士特觀揚的一樣，而齊林斯基，也積極的在煽動波蘭境內烏克蘭要求自治。</p>
<p>波蘭現在是正跟這暗殺及煽動竭力奮鬥。但過去的奧大利與蘇台德區，及現在的捷克與斯洛伐克的事實，真不能不叫她寒心。希特勒一眼瞥到的地方，他的　囉是不會放鬆的。</p>

<h3>港府已有整個計劃　根本救濟難民　可能時積極設法遣送回鄕　一方面訓練難民工作生產</h3>
<p>羅文錦對記者談</p>
<p>華南戰事發生後、港邊及內地難民、紛紛逃來本港、港府以友邦逃難國民、實有援助之義務、故對於此輩難民安置問題、無時無刻不積極攷慮設法、據最近統計、刻下本港政府收容難民尙有萬餘人之多、分別安置於本港九龍新界各難民營中、計政府在過去五個月來、收容救濟此項難民、工作臺為積極、關于難民今後安置問題、各方刻正在注目中、記者昨日訪晤華人代表羅文錦律師、以此項問題叩詢、羅代表表示、港府對于難民之管理已委由司徒永覺醫官員全部責任、故目前救濟計劉及方法本人未能詳悉、至今後安置辦法、据本人所知、本港政府早己决定其政策、相當時期即可按照此項步驟實施、</p>
<p>遣送返鄕</p>
<p>該項政策、至為適當、大致可分為兩項原則、第一點為積極在可能範圍內設法遣送難民反回其家鄕、使其繼續生產、第二點則為籌劃根本救濟、如籌辦工賑等、使因環境關係未能返鄉之難民獲得其工作、在港府之意、認為對于友邦遇難國民予以援助、固為一種應有之義務、惟是長期收容、無條條予以衣食住梂種亨受、使避難者消失其返囘故鄉之念、長此居留外地、間接影響友邦國家人口咸少、生產微弱、如此則對于友邦不持無益、抑且有害、本港政府對此問題曾有縝密之攷慮、經决定在可能環境內遇廖難民家鄉已吿安全者、則實行將之遣因</p>
<p>訓練生產</p>
<p>其次則為根本救濟問題、政府除積極設法遣送難民返鄕外、對于因家鄕淪陷、或已經毀滅、無法還鄕流落本港之難民、亦積極設法妥為安置、良以難民坐食旣久、至容易養成惰性故政府對于未能返鄕之難民、經决定計劃、訓練難民學習種種生產技能、使憑其技能力量博取生活、此為本港政府救濟難民所堅持一種原則、督憲羅爵士在過去數月來、對于救濟我國避難同胞、非常重視、無日不在考慮商洽妥善之方法、此種異常之關壞、實至可感相信上項計劃、將來必能獲得完滿結果也、</p>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>潮汕米荒的探索</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>推波助瀾的是奸商與貪污之流</p>
<p>米荒嚴重，民食堪憂。旅港潮州商會及南番中順四邑商　等經紛紛額請中央豁免洋米免稅，以維民生。可是，蔣委員長的覆電，卻是應毋庸議。這究竟是怎麽一囘事呢？黨中，自然有它的原因在。</p>
<p>為探素「謎般的答案，記者昨天　地，訪州商會—席林子豐先生，　　　　潮洲實情之商業打聽一下底總。雖然這　很複什的一個問題，却亦不難找出它的線索；雖然眾說紛紜，卻亦自有它的共同點。這裏，亟應將探索得來的憲情，扼要地為讀者報道如次：</p>
<p>瑚汕的糧食生產，向來是不够潮汕人民食用的。不敷之額，過去多數來自長江流域各省，而以無湖為大宗。因為蕪湖米畜有黏質最宜於潮汕頭大同胞煮稀飯之用。在戰事　生以前的平常狀態，輸入潮梅二區的米糧約在一百五十萬包，每包一百八十斤以汕幣二十元計算，潮二區每年應購人三千萬元汕幣的米糧始足以維持潮梅的民食。過去因交通便利，無論本地收成豐歉如何，外米供給，從無斷絕之虞，只見米貴，尙未見米荒。</p>
<p>可是，這個苟安局勢到了烽火漫天，交通梗塞之後，運輸兩湖國米的粤漢路中斷了；蕪湖米為×人禁止出口了。洋米呢，每包二十元汕幣，入口應納國幣五元以上的稅，商人因以無利可圖，亦就不幹這樣的生意。閩贛，雖仍有通路，實則亦極感困難。數軍亦有限，於是求過於供，潮州與四邑，及鄰近淪陷區一帶。每元僅講白米四斤左右。全省各地平均起來，米價平均較去年同時昂貴一倍。於是乎，中產以上的人吃乾飯的改為稀飯，中產以下，尤其是每日勞動所得報堪一飽的，現在不能不拉緊褲帶少吃兩碗；馬馬虎虎用雜糧來裝飽肚子，亦已經　求之　得了。</p>
<p>平糶，評定米價。開原，節流，原來亦未嘗沒有救濟的辦法。無奈地方上的貪官，豪劣，奸商，狼狽為奸，每次皆以冠冕堂皇的名義，為幌子，公然黑着良心，唯利是圖，而丢棄老百姓於不顧。提到潮安之　耀，汕頭之評定物價，潮汕的民衆，對於從中操縱，假公濟私之徒，無不痛恨入骨，其奈下情不能上達何！</p>
<p>邇來因為去年十月收成之晚冬舊谷已罄，六月早冬新谷又未登場，在靑黃不接中，而推波助瀾，從中搗鬼之奸商，貪汚，則猖獗如舊，因此，米荒之嚴重，越顯示其深度了。在別的方面無能為力時，就只有請中央豁免洋米免稅入口之一途而已了。</p>
<p>中央為什麼不俯順民情，體恤時艱准如所請呢？談釗這裏，我們不能不記起痛心的敎訓：</p>
<p>廿六年，廿七年，潮汕方面亦黨請准豁免洋米免稅進口的，結果老百姓並未領受政府的因惠，而免稅的利益，則完全落人奸商及一般貪汚之私襄中。因為免稅洋米有數量與時間的限定，奸詐的商家在免稅期間，頃其家產，大量購買洋米加囤積不售，存米雖多，亦仍是供求不協調而價格高昂。直到免稅時期已滅，在他精密的計算中，明知市面存米若干，遲早終有一天，就要走上商人門上來了。這時候，要怎樣抬高價格，就任所欲為了。因為大量的米，是存在這些亦是「托刺斯」的米商中。拜洋米免稅之賜的，結果只有奸商市儈，及其保護者之貪汚豪劣。老百姓依然是徒呼奈何！</p>
<p>所以洋米免稅的先决條件，是應該沒有時間與沒有數量的限制，使奸商無從搗鬼。當潮州商會請求時，亦有明白說明這一點。亦就是因為這一點，所以中央未便遽爾應允。因為現在雖然事實上是沒有什麽洋米稅可以抽收，但是，一放洋未入口，僅潮汕一處，每年就要有三千萬元的資金流出。這楚有影嚮於外匯平衡的，關於一這點，潮州商會亦體諒到中央當局顧全戰時整個金融的苦衷，只是如何購運鄰省國米？潮州商會現冉有呈請指示。其實現在內地交通，亦不免有些是為强有力者所操縱，運輸米糧，又有奸人藉以中飽。所以，歸根到底還是「人」的問題，政治的問題。</p>
<p>究竞將如何解决米荒的問題呢？無論是豁免洋米免稅，發展交通，開墾荒地，强迫冬耕，改良生產方法，一切的一切，都應該有「好人」站在公忠體團的立場，認認認眞眞地幹那才有辦法，認眞地幹，不合理的組織，畸形的現飲，好商貪汚之流就無從施其伎倆，民間亦可能發揮它力量來帮助政府建設。所以，歸根到底，這是「人」的問題，是政治未上軌道的問題。</p>

<h3>電影批評ABC</h3>
<p>— 周衛</p>
<p>談到電影批評，很快的就會使我們聯想到電影批評應該怎麽產生的問題。關於這些，在理論上似乎已經說得不少了，然而，也就因為理論還是理論——和事實還有若干距離，因此，正確的電影批評基礎也許是奠下了，但正確的電影批評卻未曾被廣泛地展開，這使我們意識的光是高談理論，實在是不够的，而在這曾被譏為「文化的荒島」的香港，要使它能開出燦爛的電影批評的花朶，似乎還應該從培植種子——所謂「啓蒙」的工作做起，因此而不揣謭陋地，隨自己一時所想到的，寫下一些ABC：</p>
<p>三個基點：</p>
<p>（一）本身的修養批評電影，似乎每一個電影觀衆都有這種資格———不管他的智識是如何的有限，見解是如何的歪曲，他都有隨口亂吹一通的自由；然而，要「形諸筆墨」把一個人的見解，播於廣大的讀衆，影嚮社會的視廳，在做這一工作之前，却就不能不對自己作一嚴粛的檢討。</p>
<p>我們知道，電影是錯綜複什的綜合藝術她的對象是整個人為的社會，和整個自然界的宇宙，他所接觸的範圍的廣泛，是任何其它一個比較褊狹的藝術部門所不能及，因此，要作為一個健全的電影批評者，他的先天條件，最主要的就是在各種學問上都有良好的修養——這也許是要求太高，但最少對各種學問都應該有所　　——尤其是關于藝術原理，社會科學，美不等，否則不足以言寫一個中肯綮地折電　批評。</p>
<p>（二）電影的常識關於電影各種高深的原理，這也許是專家們的事情，但作為一個電影批評的工作者，對電影最基本的常識，却不能不知道。我們常　到一些「牛頭不對馬嘴」的的所謂電影批評。不但不能助觀衆作進一步的理解，而且也不能使電影工作者「心悅誠服地，作進一步的改善。這實在是裨於電影文化運動的可怕的浪費。我們不能以「會吃蛋的不一定要會生蛋』的廢詁來作擋箭牌自己不會生蛋，固然不必苛求，但究竟怎樣生出來，卻非知道不可，不然你又何能找出它的　謏，而書而　以批評呢？</p>
<p>（三）正確　認識一個電影工作者，沒有正確的世界觀與人生觀，必然製作不出好作品；一個電影批評的工作者。沒有正確的世界觀與人生觀，同樣中寫不出好文章。假如批評者與製作者同　湖塗，那麽兩筆糊塗賬加在一起，它的毒害更是不可以道里計，否則，批評有能有正確的認識，他必能揭發製作　的　　而遏止它的毒害；如製作者也並不糊塗的話，那　更可發揚之而使它的影嚮擴大。所以在為一個電影批計的工作者，你的需要有正確的觀念，是——幾乎比製作者還要迫切。</p>
<p>同時，這是否正確，也可以作為是否有　冷靜的咱腦一解，通常，每一個電影批評，都常會　，一種一時的「偏見」而　自已的自　作用動搖，或是炫於某一種什麽「偉大」，而覺得眼花繚亂，不知從何處下手，這都是主觀觀念不够堅强，頭腦不够冷靜的毛病。它的影響，常使事實遭受曲解，這也是幹電影批評的工作，應該拿理智來加以尅服的。</p>
<p>如何批評？</p>
<p>針對着一部好的，或者是頃的電影，用一種概括的，囫　吞　的寫法，來展開我們的批評，實在是很不確當的辦法。我們要知道，一部電影之所以為好，究竟好在什　地方？所以為壞，究竟又壞在甚麽地方？這在構成這一部電影的各個部鬥上，加論是功是過，都各各有它應該負的責任，因此眞　談到電影的此評，就非應用一種解剖學——把它拆開來，逐部加以分柝不可，不然，就决不能得到批評的眞價。</p>
<p>為着「綱舉目張」謹隨手舉出些項目，加以簡略的叙過，並期待高明的補充：</p>
<p>（一）中心意識用「為電影前電影一的看法專談電影似乎這一問題應該是不能列在前面的。然而，當電影已被肴成為大衆敎育工具的今日，在「一切藝術的評價决定於它的社會作用」的大原則之下，中心意識的是否健全，已成為每一部鴛影是否有它存在的價値的大前提，己經是不容詭計的事實了。這是近代藝術批評的一大進步，同時也是每一個電影批評的工作者所應該把握住的一點。</p>
<p>（二）主題的處理無論戲劇是電影，每一部作品總要有它一個主題。主題的處理得不好，或者暗晦不明，就足以使作品在成就大减色，沒有主題，或者是不知什麽叫主題，那更是笑話　，然而，事實上我們正。多可看見這種不知所云的東西，這是製作者的幼稚病，批評者應指出這種錯誤，幷促使製作者對加強主題的認識。</p>
<p>（三）演出效果一部作品的是否能受羣衆的歡迎，最主要的就決定在它的演出效果上是否是好。有時一個很歪曲的事實，也能欺騙歡樂，而使之「滿意」，就是這個原故。這一個問題的界說很廣泛，是一個總和，也是一種旋律，操縱錯的，有時應被强　的反被忽略，應　忽略的反被强調，因此　造成不應該有的　反效果一出來。在這種地方，批評者就應該以冷靜而前確的眼光加以指。</p>
<p>（四）劇本在每一個電影製作上，人們祗看見「明星」——忍略了他幕後的編劇，甚至導演，這是資本主義的「皮相藝術」所浩成的惡果，非常要不得的　而新的批評者，就應該注意到：不但導演可以决定一個戲的生命，而編來的是否健全也和整個戲的成就上有不可分　的重要，才不會犯上「捨本逐未」的誤誤。</p>
<p>（五）導演無疑的一部正　的　作，她的成功與失敗，導演者因為對一切都有決定的權能，所以他是要負百分之百的責任的，人們所看見的「明星」池祗是在製作過程上對導演負起他所應負的　任而已。然而人們忽視了導演。這原因是有許多導演們——這情形尤以香港為最　。反而要「大明星」來導演我們，而事實上他們在攝影場裏也許祗是比小工重要一點。這是一個怪像。我們除了在正常的情形之下，指出導演者所應負的功過之外，還應　促使人們知道導演的重要——沒有好的導演决不命有好的製作，並促使每一個導演應該為　他自己的『地位』，而負起他所不可矮　的責任。</p>
<p>（六）演員世界上决沒有萬能的演員，然而在中國尤其是香港，却儘多可以萬能自豪，因此演員們所演的自己，除了代表他們那個本人以外，在藝術的評價上，是不堪設想的，他們對於藝術的理解，多數旣是那麽膚淺，演技的修養，自然更談不到，而所謂『個性』，亦就不知是什麽東西了。要他們能「稱職」，「演得好」，那能不是一緣木求魚」？因此批評者就應該根據正確的見解，把他嘆她的　誤，和所應走的路　出來，使他們有自我警惕性，而從事於眞正藝術的努力！</p>
<p>其它「佈景」的——最低限度是是否那種，——國中人——。以住得的；「服裝」的是否太誇張——如最沂的古裝劇，祇是色彩的炫耀——太簡陋；「燈光」是強弱的必配上否適合於中所需要；「道具」的配置是否無妨碍於整個戲上的空氣？「分幕」在整個劇本中是否分配適當？等等都和稱成一個好的，或壞的電影，有密切的關係而不能加以忽略。但是為這裏篇的有限，和交稿的時間已促，能在忽促中結束了，以後有機會希望再談談。</p>
<h3>從兒童劇運談起</h3>
<p>— 朱白水</p>
<p>香港兒童劇團兒童節聯演的發引</p>
<p>一救救孩子吧」！</p>
<p>這偉大而迫切的呼聲，在魯迅先生未逝世前呼到他逝十了。從未抗戰呼到抗戰了。然而，這迫急的呼聲，也祗有越呼越擴展越嚴重！</p>
<p>生長在　會制度不良的中國兒童，我們不能不說是有着多少乖命的，不論敎育與娛樂方面都沒有良好的建設，叫他們死背數百年前的老古董，或過着垃圾堆流浪兒的日子，這種矛盾而悲慘的現象，做大人的决不能漠視吧！</p>
<p>抗戰後，殘酷地在×人鐵蹄的蹂躪下，成千成萬失了可愛的家鄕田園，親慈的父母弟妹底兒童，更踏上了悲苦哀憐的流浪逃亡的長途；生命的延續固然是嚴重，而怎樣使他們在抗戰中生長，怎樣使他們在炮火中　健起來的敎養間題，同樣是嚴重而迫切的！</p>
<p>在這樣，我們想起現在隸干政治部的孩子劇團這夥在炮火中生長的　難民，在艱勇苦敢中奔踏過數千里的長途，是如何使人感到驚異然而是感珮的呢？</p>
<p>其他如苦鬥在×人的後方的河南兒童救亡劇團，和過港不久現在流浪式地苦幹干　洋各地的厦門兒童劇團，還有在廣州淪陷中踏上逃亡之途，現在工作於廣西的廣州兒童劇團等，都同樣使我們有了一種特殊的慨感。</p>
<p>以這種慨感中，少多地顯示着目前抗戰中兒童敎育問題的方案，自然我們不能完全地利用戲劇去解决這嚴重的問題，但却明白地知道，在正確的敎育和娛樂而配合着抗戰救亡工作的要求下，戲劇可以達到若干效能。</p>
<p>蔡楚生底「迷途羔羊」祗是給我們一個　體而深刻的暴露與問題嚴重性的提示，但直到現在我們仍不能獲到正確的解决或提供。對方興未艾的兒竄戲劇是應當有重大的責任，在於戰時的今日，這個問題的提出更不是多餘的。</p>
<p>在中國，沒有如進步的蘇聯有著名的中央兒童戲院，莫斯科兒童劇院，更沒有成名的天才兒童劇作家薩支女士；過去，祗是貧弱地有過「可憐的秋杳」，「夢遊仙境」這類歌舞或神誕劇，直到九一八後我們才珍貴地看到許幸之的一最後一課，「古廟鐘聲」這類較有戲劇性的完整的兒童劇本產生，同時，中國新興的兒童劇運才有萌芽的雛形。</p>
<p>一切藝術化底進步都在偉大的抗戰中生長起來，兒童戲劇也在抗戰時戲劇底蓬幼的發展底幌子下建立着，各體兒童劇團先後成立，先後到鄕村，醫院，軍營，戰壕等角落去，這都證明兒童戲劇在戰時同樣是有着重大的功能和力量。</p>
<p>這也强烈地表現戲劇賦予給兒童正確的敎育和良好的精神糧食，啓發了兒童最眞純的智理及力量。在敵人底侵略下使他們康健地生長着：</p>
<p>香港底一切文化工作都行進得緩慢，抗戰後戲劇的開展已算是急銳的尖兵。直到最近，戲劇的進展似乎有着突擊的姿態地前衝着，然而，兒童劇運始終幷未為人所注意地栽陪着！</p>
<p>很普遍地在香港的學校遊藝會裏我們仍舊看到「毛毛雨」或「萄葡仙子」式的或非驢非馬式的西洋兒童歌舞劇的演出。　固然由于環境的使然，而兒童劇本身正確的本質未被人所了解，和從事劇運工作未好好的把它建立起來也是不可否認的。</p>
<p>可是，實際上兒童劇的產生在香港已有着萌芽了。</p>
<p>在組織上及工作表現上都有相當成就的，我們首先指出『螞蟻兒童劇團』。這個組織成立已有年餘，會演過『最後一課』，「幫助我們游擊隊」，及「血的故事」等，井自動舉辦了個街頭兒童學校，敎育一羣失學的流浪兒，這種學習的精紳是非常値得敬佩的。</p>
<p>在最近，有一夥新的為愛好戲劇工作的　朋友又組織了個「先鋒兒童劇團」，曾公演過「愛國三兄弟」及「最後一課」等，也很努力，其他如學賑會，丁廿劇團。靑年同樂社等即有兒童團組織，並先後公演過兒童戲劇。</p>
<p>從這裏我們可以知道香港兒童劇運已開始在新的滋長，而這種滋長會使牠開出美麗而鮮艷的花夾——</p>
<p>四四兒童節行將到臨了，這一大羣小先鋒為了加强開展香港的兒童劇運，和擴大兒童節對新的影響，于是召開了個聯席會議，决意在四四兒童節當中聯合公演一個四幕長劇，（『兒童萬歲」，螞蟻劇團集體創作），作建樹香港兒童劇連的碑界，最近他們已經開始熱烈的籌備了。</p>
<p>兒童劇運在祖國中已開始强靱的鬥爭了，在香港這特殊的環境中，能够以最新的姿態把兒童劇運基礎地建樹起來是急需的，因此，我們熱烈地祈望着這次兒童節的聯　啊！</p>
<p>劇運動態</p>
<h3>黃花崗在加緊排演中</h3>
<p>本港各戲劇團體，）為加强戲劇界統一戰綫共同工作，和紀念偉大的民族節日起見，特决定聯合香港四十餘劇團，在三，二九公演拉偉大國防羣衆劇『黃花崗」；經過幾次的會議，一切工作進行，均已分別編配完妥。同時，還决定和香港各界賑濟華南難民聯席會台作，公演收入全部送該會賑濟難民，在宣傳外復負籌賑的工作這是有着雙重重大的意義的。「黃花崗一這個劇本，是去年在廣州黃花節公演前由廣東戲劇協會夏衍，胡春冰，羅海沙，周鋼鳴，樓兆揭，阮琪，蔡碧靑等二十二人集體創作的，現在因為時間和環境的轉變，台詞有多少不大適合，故日前已公推胡春冰先生重新修改，日昨已修改完畢，寄桂付印，大概日內就可印妥寄港了。現在，他們己經根據着修改後的草稿，開始在導演團五位導演的領導下，加緊排演了，上天之後，我們就可以看到這空前的偉大的演出。</p>
<h3>救亡演劇隊來港</h3>
<p>上海救亡演劇第二隊將由桂來港，準備出國宣傳的消息，我們在前兩期已發表過了。本來，他們是定上月十日由桂動身、預定上月底或本月初就可抵港了；可是到現在還沒有踪跡，本港文化界和戲劇界的朋友都非常掛念。頃接該團團長金山君於本月自桂寄來航信，才知道因為旅費和購買外匯問題未解决，以致遲遲未能成行。現定一切問題都已解决，已决定於本月十日由桂林赴海防轉輪來港；此次來港，將有四十天的勾留，辦理出國手續及購置一切物件，在港期間，準備作二三次的公演。此外又擬與本港文化界和戲劇界朋友交換意見，及開戰利品展覽會，展覽該團年來去華中前綫隨軍工作所獲的戰利品。預算行程，由桂林至海防，如果舟車便利的路，一星期可到，由海防來港，航程三四日可到，大槪總不出這幾天便可抵港吧！不過，因為戰時交通的不便，如果現在由桂林往海防沒有汽車和輪船的話，那麼行程就要擱多少日子了！本港文化界和戲劇界現正準備該團到港　舉行歡迎呢，</p>
<h3>旗鼓重整的中旅</h3>
<p>中國旅行劇團自從「分家」而縱「重建」以後，仍舊在唐槐秋先生的領導下，接受了過去的經騐和敎訓，從新負起劇運的使命。現在，他們已重整旗鼓，刷新陣容，開始加緊排演新劇，準備公演；同時，他們的團址，也早已由鬧噪噪　轟轟的統一酒家四樓　到一個頗為淸雅幽靜的所在——灣仔鳳凰台十一號。陣容較前亦頗不弱，新舊團。男女計有三十三人：「中旅」台柱。唐若青已於月初由桂回港了，唐若英，彭國華，張瑛黃河等亦都是很能幹的靑年劇人。準備上演的劇本共有二十五個到三十個，目前已着手排演準備第一次演出的有本刊第九期介紹過的尤兢新著一衣濺淚」和「凰鳳城」『祖國』，『塞上風雲』『原野』，『人之初』，「我們的故鄕』等七個劇，將於下月正式公演、以國語和粤語分別演出。願他們好好努力不要辜負過去的光榮！（按：關於中旅詳情，請參閱本刊下期期的『在重建中的中旅』。）</p>
<h3>電影與女性</h3>
<p>— 潔麗</p>
<p>在世界這一個廣大的舞台之上、男性與女性，原是一雙缺一不可的角色人類的生活上，决不能缺少了兩性的調劑，這就是說，女性是是决不可少的，世界上一切的戲劇藝術，假使沒有了女性參加，那簡直就不成其為戲劇藝術，假使沒有女性參加，那簡直就不成具為戲劇藝述。如果我們要在世界上找出幾部沒有女人的電影那實在不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>女性在電影之中、是成為不可缺少的。而在社會上男性中心的傾向還十分明顯，十分露骨的中國，女性在電影之中所佔的比重，是史其大大地增强，尤其在這作為中國電影事業之都的香港，社會環境是那樣地佈滿着粉紅的色彩，酒精與色情，成為一般公子哥兒買辦富翁日常不可或缺的刺激品，電影中的女性，一般成為那些電影觀衆所最注目的東西，因而，女性在電影中所佔的地位，也就十分可觀，一部電影而沒有女性，那實在是一件不可想像的事，我們只有見過以女性的衆多，美麗，或是肉艷來誇張的影片，釙從未見有全片找不出一個女性那樣的片子。</p>
<p>在香港這個特殊的地方，在男性中心的傾向十分濃厚的社會，電影對于女性描畫之日益細緻，日益　視，甚至電影成為以女性為中心的東西，這一切，並不足以表示在男性中心社會上女性地位的加强，而是說明：一般的電影觀衆，在酒精與色情與環境底經常的陶冶演染中，是已不斷地把他們對于電影的注意點，移到了女性描寫的身上。於是，我們可以見到市塲上那許多以女性為中心的電影。獵取了大單的觀衆。</p>
<p>電影之以女性為中心，着重于對女性的紀緻的　畫，這原不能算是電影向下的傾向，問題是在，電影究竟是在怎樣的立塲，怎樣的方向，怎樣的手法上來描畫女性，它所描畫出來的究竟是怎樣的女性。在目前，一般電影對于女性的描畫，都不過追隨于社會趣味之後，從事于低級的表現，他們的立場，是站在男性中心的地位，對于女性有着另一種看法的，而所謂方向與手法，實在可憐得很，都不過是庸俗的，劣弱的，從而，其所表現出的女性，都是敷淺的，非眞實的，它們底目的，實際不過是藉着女性的描畫，吸引大部分觀衆而已。</p>
<p>其實，電影對于女性的描寫，應該從一種深該的觀點上，從社會的特殊的環境中，去發掘目前環境下底現鄕女性的典型。</p>
<h3>舞臺技術講話</h3>
<p>— 盧敦</p>
<p>五演員的藝術</p>
<p>A最易同時又是最難的藝術。</p>
<p>泰洛夫說：「如眾要問什麽是最容易的藝術？我將答以演員的藝術。如果冉問什麽是最難的藝術？我也將　樣答以演員的藝術」。</p>
<p>就因為演員的表演藝術，不過是以人扮演人本是一榕並不怎樣困難的事情，所以就有人懷疑到具作藝術底價値；戈登格雷就說：「我從來不相信演戲是藝術。會跳的羔羊和農林里的夜鶯，前者好像會舞蹈，後者好像會唱歌，你能說她們是藝術家嗎？」可是這一論斷是並不健全的；因為戲劇的演出不是現實的日常生活；羔羊之跳與夜鶯之明只是一種生活的本能，而且她們之跳，叫，也是日常生活的情緒。但演昌之在舞台上表演却不是本身的日常生活，而是經過了藝術創造的手段產生出來的東西；而這種東西，換言之，這經過了藝術底手段創造出來的情緒，是足以「感染」別人而發生共鳴的。所以，表演藝術　價值是存在的。</p>
<p>而且，表演藝術之所以成為「難」的藝術，是因為她一面在裝作，而同時就在創造。小說家過了若千時間製作的過程，完成了一篇小說。當他再仔細地念一遍的時候，如果發現內中修詞不當的地方，可以修改，再修　——以至於盡善盡美，才拿來公之於世。但演員的表演就沒了這優越的條件，她的　作是一面在製作的時候，同時就是創造，創造的過程，同時就是創造的完成。</p>
<p>因此，說演員的藝術容易亦難不可，但細想下去，也是相當的難。</p>
<p>B實戚的創造。</p>
<p>一般地講來：演員的表演藝術就是眞實感的創造，而最主要的是要使觀衆始終相信而不發覺。</p>
<p>眞實感　創造，換言之即經過了某種製作的手段而創造出來的，那麽這已經是，「非眞實的眞實感」了，而只是一種創造的東西，這東西底創造的方法，演員首先在自己底腦子里創造一個「假定」，一個創造的「想像的眞實；」史坦尼司拉夫斯基在其名著「我底藝術生活」中說：「當演員底霖魂與想像中顯示着奇幻的，創造的「假定」時，才有創造性。如果只有眞的現實，只有人們自然而忽不能不相信的實際的眞實創造性還沒開始，等到創造的的下假定　出現卽演員以忠實與最大的熱情，來相信這「想像的現實一比相信眞的現實還要相信的時候，那麽，演員就從眞的現實邁進另一個人生，那就是由他自已創造性，想像的「假定」相信了這個人生的時候，演員才能開始創造。」</p>
<p>因此，想像與幻像底發展就是表演藝術底創造的基調，而這種靈感的東西，卻又不能以人工的方法去强迫完成的，史坦尼說：「——言不是親我要以人工的方法創造靈感，那是不可能的，我所要求的是從何去創造一個好的品質，（指演員的本身）能藉意志以表揚靈感。」　「藉意志以表揚靈感，」這才是表演藝術的金科玉律！　我們知道演員的表演幷不是日常的現實生活，只不過是一種眞實感的創造而已，可是人類的靈感。或者說人類的情感作用却是一種一定的，又是必然的生理的反應。感受了某種刺激，才发生一定程度的反應，這是人類现實生活的现象，可中方才說過演員的表演，並不是日常的現實生活，舞台上，演員幷沒有如日常生活一樣會感受到某種刺激，但却要表現出恰如受到某種刺激一樣的一定程度的反應的情緒，不能多，亦不能少，要恰到好處，否则，就失掉了眞實感，而被　衆發覺了在做戲　要做到這一步演員首先要训練自己，使之成為一個「好的品質」，能自己指挥控制，藉意志以表扬好感，能够自由的蓮用自已的身體一內在的，神經系統的自我控制；外在的，眩態動作的操縱，十演員必須能够統制他的注意力，能夠成為自己底一切表情動作的主宰。（未完）</p>

<h3>國際足球複賽　中英兩軍對壘　看誰奪得爭標權　今日下午四時在加路連山舉行</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】去屆足球六錦票、我華隊榮獲五項、獨名稱國際賽之英文星期報盃、則被外人奪去、致包辦錦票之宏願、終未得償、本屆我華隊又有包辦　標之趨勢、惟張望前途、尚多荊棘、凡我健兒、此後非加倍努力不為功、</p>
<p>即以今日下午四時在加路連山之國際複賽而言、若中　隊得勝、將英格蘭隊淘汰出局、亦不過僅獲决賽權、至於奪標問題、尚談不到、如不幸而敗、則　成　望、無補於將來、故必得渡過今日之難關、然後進一步於四月十日與葡萄牙隊作爭標戰、</p>
<p>中英兩隊人材相比較、誠有上下床之別、蓋英隊方面、同籍之海車球員、因赴星洲演操、未及為之效力、對人選問題、不得已而求其次、遂有乙組球員四名入選、故全隊實力、略欠充　、然得米杜息三前衛支持於中路、及帕架、衣史杜蘭　　磨士、劾利等名將參預其間、勢尚不弱、未可輕視之、</p>
<p>華隊則有李惠領導前軍、聲威足以奪人、其餘各將、亦俱為上選、　　燈滔昨又負　、未悉今日參戰與否、如　缺　、則以後備黃景聰代、黃固矯捷、當勝任愉快、宋　聖疋　外　完全復原、若不能勉强登場、則以曾仲云代之為最適當、先　兩陣如下、</p>
<p>【大中華隊】</p>
<p>許竟成（東方會）　侯澄滔（東方會）</p>
<p>李天生（南華南）　黎兆榮（南華南）</p>
<p>譚均幹（南華華）　梁榮照（南華南）　李惠堂（南華會隊長）</p>
<p>侯容生（光華會）　馮景祥（南華南）</p>
<p>宋靈聖（東方會）　鄧廣　（南華南）</p>
<p>後備：李德奇、曾仲云、羅偉權（東方會）卓石金、</p>
<p>黃景聰（光華會）　楊水益（南華會）</p>
<p>【英格蘭隊】</p>
<p>建臣（米杜息）　　非路（軍需隊）</p>
<p>柏架（警察會）</p>
<p>劾利（九龍會）　畢禮地（米杜息）　衣史杜蘭治香港會（隊長）　車特力（炮兵隊）</p>
<p>哥邊（炮兵隊）　菲士窩打（米杜息）　磨士（警察會）　奄巴土（炮兵隊）</p>
<p>後備：禮　士（炮兵隊）　韓尼維路（海軍隊）　夏文、曾寧士（米杜息）</p>
<p>華隊奮力如是之雄、照理必　、　以前線五虎、威力最大、吾料於作戰當中、此五　不　則已、如其有機可、一經越過對方之前衛、　可前進無阻、蓋英隊兩內衛、帕架雖　　豐富、　作　、　慣充前、今調才在後方、以攖華　五虎之、　致　促無　、有應付維難之嘆、哥　乃　組材雖因技有可取、然後錄用、但一旦負　重責、　而抵禦華隊　一　之前　、誡恐力有未逮、故華隊　鋒於進展時才　　　　　慮　以、過對方　前衛線、　　　其最後防　之極力抵抗、雖以迫近、惟仍須避實乘虛、方易收效、竊以為、多　　敲側擊、較　上　、蓋為避免　中　之制肘、若常　中央突破、　覺　　、</p>
<p>英隊前線中、過半是　　球　、未足為患、惟有一點、　乙組球員之初　大任者、莫不努力以　、戰戰兢　、務　盡　、　　自　之心、甚為薄弱、若終戰局始時、彼等演　　不　者、則　理上　受絕影響、甚而　　至於怯場、　今日彼等表演如何、　視　先一舉、是否得體、</p>
<p>依我之見、華隊此役勝利、十分把握、惟英隊過半是軍人、必然奮鬥到底、且此項比賽乃採十分九鐘制、愈能奮鬥愈佔便宜不少、故華隊雖則　藝勝人、猶未足持、氣力之運用、亦為重要條件、况劇烈如足球、欲使技術有良好演出、必須以氣力須　　、</p>
<p>另有幾點事項、奉勸球迷、切宜緊記、今日下午二時、便開　五角與三角兩種門票、但看客切勿在場外　票、携帶　童、無票不得入座、如門票既售　、即將大門關閉、遲到者則不得其門而入、故望球迷提早到場、以免向　、（球場太歲）</p>
<h3>南華華凈勝九龍會</h3>
<p>水益根保德輝各中壹球</p>
<p>昨日南華華對抗九龍會於　路連山、兩隊勝負無關大局、觀者寥寥、譚均幹不出、鄧錫洪守關、其他如表九龍會劾利表演極見有序、故上半場九龍會門前、冷落異常、詎知下半場將完場之十五分鐘、南華連勝三球、奠定大局、兩陣如下、</p>
<p>（南華華）</p>
<p>鄧錫</p>
<p>劉茂　郭炳忠</p>
<p>劉偉培　林德譜　梁伯</p>
<p>謝錦洪　區士諤　陳德　　楊　保　楊水益</p>
<p>【九龍會】</p>
<p>劾利</p>
<p>烏烈　衣化</p>
<p>芝　尼　士　利　力麥</p>
<p>波寥亞臣　路佐治　士培爾　維維地　路小諾士</p>
<p>時　、培爾先撥球進攻、受阻於劉茂、炳忠久疏練習、時有隕越、幸得劉茂相助、不致誤事、南華反攻、未能獲勝、雙方你來我往、至將近完場、區士諤得接妙球、向門猛射、惜球勢略高失突却必勝良機、上半場零對零、未分勝負、</p>
<p>下半場再戰，九龍會猛攻、南華後防頓呈紊亂、謝錦　手吻球兒、被罰十二碼、由佐治主踢、用力太猛、球落網後、至二十分鐘、區土諤遠交謝錦洪　門楊水益待機門前、頂球入網、先開紀錄、無何、陳德輝領軍猛進、既近、將球交楊根保、大脚射入、中綫再開、謝錦洪將球傳中、陳　輝舉足射入、勝第一球、雙方攻守良久、再無建樹、三對零南華華大勝、</p>
<h3>港週年陸運昨舉行　楊旭華一萬公尺賽獲第一</h3>
<p>香港入學第二十四屆週年運動大會、昨日下午一時半、在　扶林道該校、動場舉行、該校學生及各界士　蒞場參觀者數百人、情形　常　鬧、賽畢、中羅文錦夫人主持頒獎禮、直至下午七時許始行散會、查昨日舉行運動秩序、共有二十餘項、各項比賽、其中競爭已為緊張劇烈者、則為　開全港中學及公開生英里　項、參加中　接力　者、有拉沙、嶺南、皇仁、聖若　、　仁、英　、　校、公開半　里參　者八人、其餘各項成績較　者、厥為一萬公尺長途賽、第　名為楊旭華、　楊氏對於長途賽、練習有素、參加　項比賽、已有多年、　次　露頭角、一鳴驚人、實非倖致、　餘項目亦不少、　美　演、　者興緻盎　、全場　　、個人　軍　傑民、亞　林禹承、宿舍冠　莫禮　堂、季軍衣律堂、季軍得瑪　堂、</p>
<h3>東方於艱難奮鬥中以一球擊敗海軍　劉顯漢一夫當關萬軍辟易</h3>
<p>昨日下午四時半、東方與海軍作甲組足球聯賽于海銅鑼灣海軍場、海軍昔日台柱、多隨艦出海、迫得起用生力軍、然整隊戰鬥力、仍極頑强、不失原日作風、（　盆、神速）、前衛線也不因狄臣缺席而渙散、運輸截擊之術、光芒畢露、戰爭七十分鐘、海軍前衛及前鋒、處于自動之地位時間達六十分鐘、假若兩　　菲頻士、岩士杜郎及懇地之流、則不致以〇比一見敗、</p>
<p>昨海軍兩　、每為曾仲雲、　華　所制、失去包抄傳送之力、但前衛各員、每吊高　、以便前　衝刺、而代左右兩　之切口、拖般等利用身高脚長之便利、　頂數險球、弄到東方風聲鶴唳、若非守衛得力、死　逃生、想東方敗績之比數、必出吾人　料之外</p>
<p>仲雲穿了新球靴、振奮異常、七十分鐘內、未嘗失足一次、可謂仲雲　生以來、最得　之作、　華國及許竟成亦有極勇猛之表演、矮脚虎劉始讚適與巨人拖般相遇、一高一矮、終日糾緾、矯脚虎雖吃力、而巨人亦感頭痛、</p>
<p>東方前　傷兵纍纍、踝痛之宋靈聖、足傷之侯澄滔、失去活動力、吳祺祥　誤頗多、李德祺散漫無能、祗陳炳土有驚人進步、屢破重關、實取勝之淵源也、東方此勝、固挽回不少令譽、尤可喜者、則同日敗於警察之南華南、因賴東方遞奪海軍兩分、使自己之最高地位、不致搖動、奪標希望、仍高於一切、故東方間接造福於南南、其功　實比去週南華華之勝海軍、更為偉大也、</p>
<p>（東方會）</p>
<p>劉顯漢</p>
<p>苗華國　曾仲雲</p>
<p>羅偉權　許竟成　劉始讚</p>
<p>候澄滔　宋靈聖　李德祺　吳祈祥　　炳土</p>
<p>（海軍隊）</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>（一分鐘）艮笛一聲、開始接觸、東方大展神威、奪得寶貝、祇見李四縱身一送、炳土狂奔進襲、J韓尼維路攔阻不來、被炳土在底線傳中、澄溜潛伏門角、搖頭一頂、先開紀錄、（一比〇）</p>
<p>（十三分鐘）林巴士斜自切中、紐蘭士衝前一頂、顯漢快手擒拿、得免子　、轉瞬間、拖般又施冷射、顯漢慌忙︸撲、球兒在門前滾動、仲雲于紐蘭未衝至前、快馬救出、</p>
<p>（十五分鐘）竟成遠吊球兒、哥路打士衝出按接、不料目標不準、走過落點、及至反身時、球在門前而下、哥氏急即囘身一撥、祇負角球、亦云幸矣、</p>
<p>（卅二分鐘）亞利臣得韓尼維路之輸送、得機傳中、紐蘿頂而不中，左翼林巴士再運前一射、落野無效、</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>（七分鐘）麥基利士打得前衛之接濟、在卅碼外遠射、顯漢視線被本隊球員所阻、幾告失手、</p>
<p>（十五分鐘）始讚與拖般鬥法、誤犯手球　烈厘主罰、海軍前鋒湧進東方門前、拖般迎球猛頂、顯漢拍出、林巴士截着出射、顯漢抱個滿懷、一脚送出、</p>
<p>（廿三分鐘）林巴士門前頂射、顯漢一托出界、僅負角球、</p>
<p>（卅分鐘）靈聖得球進襲、海軍守衛、相率攔截、糾緾間、靈聖之兩　短褲、　然一聲、相告破裂、以肉白相見、是時東方後防告緊、靈聖祇以褲裂肉見、迫得以手遮掩、走出場外、換出新褲、然後返防、此際海軍仍然猛　、圍攻良久、　法取勝、遂以〇比一見負、</p>
<h3>先勝後敗　南華南輕敵喪師　四比一警　得勝亦足豪</h3>
<p>（本站特訊）一般人咸　對　　錦標有希望之　華來、　日重建警察會于對海界限　場、是警之勝負、足　影響大局、蓋南南者能此後保持不敗、則本屆錦標非彼莫屬、倘或失敗一場、形勢又　變化、間接反予海上覇以競爭之機會（幸而昨日海軍亦敗績、否則南南奪標希望微矣　、是以球迷臨場觀戰者、頗不　人、詎料南南隊故態不　、諸將輕敵、多盤誤事　結果先勝後敗、以四比三之成績慘遭　師、球迷乘興而來、敗興而返、南南不之爭氣、殊有辜負一般球迷熱望也、</p>
<p>昨日之役、南南以完整之師對抗警罕、應付本綽有餘裕、詎應勝而竟未能勝、其失敗之主因、在於諸將輕敵及球　不、　　郭英祺既已表演　常、後防張　才又復不　、在理諸將應如　努力、穩　多勝、奠定基礎、奈各員敵人事、初則短傳密集、不明球場短狹、不宜短傳戰略、迂迴傳　、費特失　、　則操之過急、自　　戰方略、馮景祥主射最後之十二碼罰球、亦因求和心切、掃射　力、竟為麥哈地撲救、　後一綫良機、亦竟錯過、以記者觀察、景　對主　十二碼自由球、球路純熟但掃射力已不比往昔强勁、易為守將撲救以後南南如逢此等良緣、應予鄧廣森以嘗試機會、警察表演平平、惟昨戰全軍英勇與氣力充足、前鋒賴磨土衝刺與花利亞輸送、造成勝球機會、後防三前衛比兩後衛較為穩固、麥哈地不過不失、全場中最能給予我華籍球迷以良好印象者、則為効力于警察會之華將、彼等演出、全無粗野舉動、且有大將風波　警察最後能反敗為勝、亦賴黃范兩將之功也、</p>

<p>一聲銀笛、兩軍即開始交　、你來我往、恍如表演拉踞式之戰爭、此時數千球迷、見狀亦驚亦喜、冉鏖戰有頃、馮忽刦奪來球、旋即轉交、老羅得阿斗、即沿邊飛奔、瞬抵要地而傳中、斯時兆榮適立于無人監現之要地、見球飛來、描準鵠的、一射入網、南南勝後、仍繼續圍攻、黎馮屢向門發射、惜球多落荒、故未致果、警旋亦反攻、磨士文貴先後沿邊進犯、貴才嘗兩次竄前接應、當時情勢頗急、幸天生鎮壓有方、一踢化險為夷、此時南南大難不死、又來進攻、英祺在要地傳黎、黎又寫寫意意、一射入綱、警察一敗再敗、心有不甘、遂大舉反攻、球由花利亞統帶、榮照紹漢雙雙出截、　略閃避、即遠向門射去、球疾如矢、榮才一時大　、遂被球由角竄進網內、未幾上半場終、</p>
<p>下半場再戰、南南又向華察陣地壓迫、馮黎先後衝進要地叩門、不下五六次之多旋廣森又帶球傳中、英祺衝近門前接應、那夫躍起頂之、不料于慌忙之中、球竟向門溜進、麥哈地雖欲撲救、亦已不及、警察再負、益竭力反攻、卒由屈士得文貴短傳之利、搶囘一球、而貴才後亦得機射門、再進一隻、抗成和局、最後則更得磨士從邊之妙傳、貴才以頭頂之又進一球南南以先勝後敗、奮起追擊、戰情紛亂、亡何那夫急救、手吻皮球、十二碼罰球放在門前、由景祥主踢、豈枓神腿求和　切、心神意亂、拋控失策、掃射過正、　又無力、遂為麥哈地撲去、南南僅此一線生機、亦遭錯適、回天無術、結果乃以四比三喪師還、（固本</p>

<h3>國際影界動態</h3>
<p>（一）、墨素里尼、前在意京創辦「電影村」、專門從事攝製宣傳意大利獨栽國動態之影片、該項影片於去年中共攝製一百八十四部、迭經運往國外放映、總計在美國公映者僅十八部在、英公映者四十四部、而最多者當然推他的同志——德國、則達七十二部、餘均禁映、</p>
<p>（二）日本籍女明星上村娘、向隸屬于美國派拉蒙影片已有七八年歷史、最近突被該公司予以解職、其原因為中日大戰後、她的出品賣座慘跌、為公司當局不滿而出此舉、按好萊塢之外籍演員被排斥、尚　創聞、</p>
<p>（三）蘇聯自第二次五年計劉完成後、其電影事業亦突然猛進、最近正在攝製新聞片達四萬餘卷、以便送往一九三九年紐約世界博覽會開映、此項短片、足使國外觀眾明暸蘇聯之概况及其國力之强盛、</p>
<p>（四）、英國影界近將有一莫大變動、蓋有一企業團體、名斐利浦合股企業公司、預備收買全英各地電影院六百所至七百所、同時有一奧迪安公司、亦預備收買屬于高蒙影片公司之三百所影院、據一般人猜測、此組織之幕後、定有若于從德國逃亡出來之猶太富翁為撐腰、故才有此雄厚之咨本、</p>
<p>（五）、何蘭屬地的華僑很多、所以國產影片在該處原佔着相當勢力、戰事發生後、無形中被粵語片壟斷了整個市場、使僑胞的信仰祖國的熱心減退許多、故無不渴望上海的國語片能早日運往、</p>
<p>（六）中國著名幽默作家林語堂、旅美從事著作乃編劇、風行一時、頗受國外人士歡迎、最近並代童星秀蘭鄧波兒編著了一個新劇本、題名「小匠人」、即將開始拍攝、按國人在好萊塢編劇、以此為矢、</p>
<p>（七）好萊塢製片家、最近極力攝製關於戰事的影片、以迎合世界人類的心理、</p>
<p>（八）美國反法西斯的活動在好萊嗚、也有嘗鮮明的表現與强勁的力量、據統計、有一萬五千個　影界從業員已加入了反法西斯委員會、（其中有主演『大地』的名星保羅茂尼、露意絲萊娜等）、援助中國及西班牙的呼聲已震憾了整個的銀都、</p>
<h3>外强中乾的影星經濟狀况</h3>
<p>有人說、『藝術家多為浪漫的、目的完全在審美與表現、慾望衹在獲得愉快的境地、如心中有所蓄、必表而出之、所以金錢到手、隨手散去、更不暇顧及將來、結果是老境困難、窮苦至死、』這話、當然有充分理由、可見美國電影明星、雖每週薪金收入、多在萬金左右、依然還要借債度日、也無非盡量揮霍、窮極奢華所致、至於事實是否完全如此、祗有聽你們本身前來訴苦了、</p>
<p>近一二年來、在美國電影界中、常發生債務訴訟、有幾位紅　半爿天的明星、今竟以破產聞、此事很引起社會上人們注意、無不表示十二分驚異、以為明星們收入、比較其他職業為　、究竟他們所得的金錢、用到何處去了、就是　官審問明星破產的債務、也時常提出這種疑問、據一般明星們說、「我們主演一片、在騁約上雖訂明週薪若干、但經過幾重剝削後、再除去一切開支實得之微、　來誰皆不信、而為　　計、仍要做出明星架子、亳不在乎的揮霍金錢如泥砂、平日既無積蓄、一旦工作中斷、原形就露出了</p>
<p>從前、所有影片公司與明平簽訂聘約、都是直接辦理、後因明星們往往自恃地位、不受管轄、于是由各大影片公司、合組一個演員介紹所、有自辦的機關報紙雜誌多種、當代明星們作宣傳之用、既操有輿論上威權、故明星們敢不唯命是聽、遇事易於就範得多、凡由其介紹簽訂聘約、照例徵收百分之十的介紹費、於是明星們的薪金、無形中就打了一個九扣、</p>
<p>以每週薪金萬元論、九扣亦當有九千元、在普通人眼光看來、維持個人生活本已綽綽有餘、無奈環境本是个奢華的地方、雖想節儉、亦不可得、凡能主演一片之人、在電影界中必已有相當地位、為本人身分計、對任同方面、皆不能顯出窮相來、　說住、在好萊塢的小住宅、其每月租金、已在七百五十元至二千元、稍為華麗一點、總在五千金以上、再加上內部陳設所費、約佔明星每月收入十分之二、亦有自建房屋的、建築費動輒亦須六七萬元至二十萬元、這一筆巨欵惟有向銀行借貨一法每月利息又要　出不少、一行　的方一面、祇有汽車一二輛、實在不够派頭、每逢汽車公司製造一種新車出來、總要設法風輪、有的連飛機亦得預備一架、至於傭人各有專實、本是好萊塢的風氣、每人每月薪金總在二百元至四百元、此外、聘請秘書一年約值本人一月的薪水又為聯絡各方感情起見每週一次的跳舞會、决不能不　行的、往往一夕所費酒筵、數萬不貲、月底、更須文出一筆巨大費用、津貼駐好萊塢的電影記者、以期筆下留情、否則損失個人名譽事　、飯碗事大、可不　哉、明星衣服似乎很闊罷、誰知他們皆是預備作演戲之用、不能不按劇中人身份、重金購辦服裝、及一片告終後、勤勞過度、當作短時期旅行、以資修養、然而薪金早已完完大吉、　得舉債、若不幸陷入愛情網中、則距離破產之期、愈不遠矣、何况、還要付巨額的所得稅呢、可是社會上辦善舉的人們、只見其入、不見其出、一有善舉、都覺得明星是最慷概的了、那知明星們的捐欵、正是咬緊了牙關拿出來的呢、</p>
<h3>銀花</h3>

<p>一般人都知道，希迪拉摩對於嘉寶威脅得相當利害、連嘉寶自己、都不免有點感覺不安了、可是、有一件事、是在神秘女郎的小傳　絕對沒有的、而希迫拉摩却有的、就是、愛交朋友、希迪拉摩、極愛交朋友、并且常常走跳舞廳、劇院那些地方、多數影星不肯送照片、簽名給人、她却都肯　影迷們要求和她通信、做朋友、她也欣然允諾、放心罷、嘉寶、無論怎樣、這神秘女郎的頭銜還是你的哩、</p>
<p>著名批評家梅爾達屈脫（Matflda　Trotter）說、亦銀幕下、好萊塢無數的男明星中、唯有傑克奧凱是具有最多性感的一人、這話使克拉克藍勃、泰隆鮑惠、勞勃泰洛等、面面相覷、而傑克輿凱却得意洋洋的說、『梅爾達屈脫、真是世上最好的批評家呢、』</p>

<h3>和平兩種</h3>
<p>— 伯山</p>
<p>十四年前，當孫總理於彌留時，斷續的發出微弱的呼聲：『和平，奮鬥，救中國！』</p>
<p>十四年後，當中國展開偉大的民族鬬爭時，無恥的漢奸，囁喘地說：『和平奮　救中國。』</p>
<p>前者的和平，是奮鬬的和平。救中國的和平：後者的和平，却是屈膝妥協的和平，亡中國的和平，前者是根據救國主義的，而後者所引為根據的却是一張近衛的宣言，其最大不同的地方，一則是自覺自發的民族醒悟，一則是出賣了靈魂的漢奸，對×人冀圖亡我國滅我種的苛求的應聲附和，我們由此可見總理與漢奸們人格的分野，理解的區別。眞誠與虛偽，偉大與無恥，總理　敎明白的昭示吾人，『欲達到此目的，必須喚起民衆，及聯合世界上以平等待我之民族。共同奮鬥』，卽是說，我們要完成國民革命這偉大的使命，對內必須喚起民衆，全國團結一致，然後冉在世界上，求同情我們，帮助我們二以平等互應待我們的國家民族，聯合起來，一致奮鬬。反抗侵略，爭取世界水久的和平理想的大同之治。</p>
<p>所以，當偉大英勇的反日反法西斯蒂的戰爭開始，我們一面以大無畏的革命精神，予侵略者以痛擊外，更遵照總理遺敎，把全國各黨各派團結成一個不可分離的統一陣綫，同時對于英法蘇等相平正義而帮助我們的國家，密切聯絡起來，而對於日寇的帮兇——法西斯蒂的强盜國家，斬釘削鐵。斷絕往來，免被利用，這就是總理遺敎中所暗示吾人，在此空前的環境中所應取的態度。</p>
<p>但是，我們的大談和平的漢奸又怎麼樣呢？他們深恐中國獲得勝利，眞正的和平到來，於是第一：反對國共合作，分裂全國統一，第二：主張走德義路綫，冷淡其他民主國友誼的助力，拒絕蘇聯道義的援助，第三，污衊游擊戰略，焦土政策，更進而主張立刻放棄戰爭，接納近衛和平要求，實現所謂東亞新秩序的和平，這便是漢奸出賣國家出賣民族的有計劃的手段，這便是漢奸高聲朗誧的和平主張。</p>
<h3>文化同武化</h3>
<p>— 星在天</p>
<p>為了蘇聯是日本的死對頭之故，所以日本人蓄下的漢奸，也是見了蘇俄分外眼紅，不過主子也好，奸字輩的人也好，他們都有一個相同之點，就是專避蘇聯而陰謀中國和中國人。</p>
<p>比如在東北，在各淪陷區，日本人殺害中國人，都是加以一個「共產黨」的帽子，主子作風如是，漢妤也不能例外，他們總是應聲附和，隨口亂喊。就如最近有幾位文化人，相繼去新疆，於是這也成了狗們亂吠的材料說：「近來一般附麗共產黨的文　。又大唱其到新疆　——闊綽些的更不惜拿絞腦汁得來的稿費，購昂價的飛機票，御風而行，好不羡然人哉！」</p>
<p>其實那些去新疆的文化人是否是附麗共產黨」，吾人自不曉得，不過可取的是他們非以自已勞力所得，供給自己坐飛機，「不惜拿絞　汁得來的稿費」買飛機票，這還比倉惶出國，乘了偷來的飛機為高。而又咬那些從主子領得「金票」天天做狗吠的奸字　人們更為高尙了。當然坐飛機去新疆的人們是「羡然人」，而奸字輩的人們，却遭人人們的憎恨，「食其肉而寢其皮」猶不為過，這是中國人的輿論。</p>
<p>三個月以來，某報從不說實話，惟獨在那一天，他們說眞話了，我們也可以借來吿誡奸字輩人。</p>
<p>「東南江浙和西南廣東幾個省份，畢竟文化水準較高，開通較早。一般民衆對於某一新問題，某一新事件。頗有其判辨的智能，無論宣傳家怎樣宜傳，怎樣說謊話，一時是不容易收效的。」</p>
<p>這話確是很對，所以屢屢在幾間學校的閱報室內，常看到某報被一團墨汁塗汚。寫上「漢奸狗屁」四個宇，可見宣傳和說謊眞是無用。不止不能收效，並且厲害些，還是性命交關呢。所以人民豈止「文化」水準高，就是除奸剷凶的「武化」水準也頗不弱呀！</p>
<h3>記陳寅格先生</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>當古城陷落之前，在西郊的淸華園中幽徑上，常可以遇見一個頭髮蓬亂，精神頽衰，穿着長袍，中國褲，中國式布鞋。行路蹣跚的文弱光生，左腋下挾着一大包書，行路蹣跚無力樣子。好云雨腋下的書量過重，不勝其苦的神氣，這個文弱先生便是譽滿士林，名馳海外的陳寅恪先生。</p>
<p>你與陳先生相見，你並不能看出陳先生的學識超衆來，不過你若同他談起來在他娓娓無力而動聽的言詞中，一定你會五體投地完全嘆服讀欽佩。但是你决不能看了他的那副不修邊幅像，而就斷定他只是一個書生罷了，以貌取人孔子還失之子羽。何况我們羽毛不豐，眼睛不亮的俗子夫凡呢！</p>
<p>同陳先生受過業的，幾乎都曉得陳　　的脾氣，第一他不好講閒話，假使你過訪陳先生，如果是無事胡聊，無話可講，陳先生一定先比你閉口。閉上眼睛，等你自己吿退。因為他最不愛說廢話。第二，他在每天下午一點錡時候，一定要休息睡眠，這就是文首所說「精神頽廢一的原故，原來陳先生身體很不好，每大都須有充份的修養，這也是他今日學識豐博所墳上的代價。如果過訪陳光生的人不知道這一層，那麽時鐘一指一點鐘，陳先生就會很不客氣的吿訴你：「對不起，我要睡覺了！」雖然如此，陳先生的第三點脾氣，就是好讀書，白天時候，手　着的工夫少，幾乎總是拿隨書讀，並且可驚的他並不是一個舊式書虫，乃是一個極科學化的新思想者，富於實　精神的研究者，記得有一次　陳先生學「隋唐史研究，」講到唐劉蛻的劉蛻文集，當研究到集首序的「野水入藏……」一處，他斷定那是指着湖南地方八月的時候說的，並且拿出三年來的　報紙，證明每到那時候，便有野水泛濫的實事。</p>

<h3>夜之情</h3>
<p>— 東號</p>
<p>爬過山嶺，馳過郊原，渡過冰冷的河流，穿過陰暗的森林，背着沉重的　袱，走在狹窄不平的河岸上。我低下了頭，讓冷風從我的雜亂的頭髮上掠過。水彼輕微地打着石灘，像幽靈的低訴。</p>
<p>寒鴉在松林的頂上打轉，呀呀的叫聲響成一片。一艘，兩艘……遠遠的帆影終於完全在黑暗裏消滅：脫了葉的疏朗的樹枝，變成漆黑的一團。</p>
<p>河面上披起闇閱的輕紗。大地又沉沉地安眠。黑色摟抱着山河，河岸，和水面，寒風好似受創的野牛，在天空迴旋呼號，像在驚擾着它們的安眠，遠村的犬吠得好緊，聲聲打進我們的心。</p>
<p>前面是一條小河，靜靜地，躺在這兒，像一條小的木板鋪着，這是橋。</p>
<p>右邊是茫茫的大河，黑墨的天空。左邊林莽中飛出尖銳的風聲，那荒落敗頽的墓墟上的枯草，被狂風吹得瑟瑟地響，……這一切描畫出　育　暴風雨的夜空。我筆直的站若在這橋邊，凝望着遠方，好像一個邊疆上的戌人。</p>
<p>終於，我的心房跳動加劇。脚也跟着　抖起來。於是，我不自覺的坐下來，頽　地，恐懼地，像一匹疲的野獸。</p>
<p>狂風掀起我的長衣，冷流，直　進我的胸膛，急忙把包袱壓在身下，犬吠得更響更緊，風聲　在悽厲地呼嘯。</p>
<p>「昨晚，寒星佈滿了夜空；月光，照着大地靜靜安眠。而今夜，烏黑的雲層滿蓋着天際。這可怕的黑夜啊！」</p>
<p>夜的原野上飄起陣陣的低唱，是誰家兒女在苦悶的高壓下發出呼聲？飄，飄向天邊，最後淹沒在狂風裏。</p>
<p>然而，接着來的是洪大的吼聲：</p>
<p>「我們需要光明，需要晴空！讓黑暗快些死滅，大膽地前進吧！像一個英勇的戰士。去尋求那風霆後的空明」！</p>
<p>山嶺間，叢林裏，石灘的隙縫中，吼聲響在每一個角落。像洪鐘，像獅吼。任狂風呼嘯，總蓋沒不了它。</p>
<p>我霍地站起來，像做惡夢後醒來，心底在激動，是上帝的指示，還是夜鶯的高歌，吿訴我一條坦途？我穩定了我的腳跟，抑制着動盪的心潮，拿起包袱，身子傴僂着，用輕快，愉快，勇敢的步調，走過橋來。</p>
<p>夜路在我的面前展開。我毫不猶豫地向前，心底裏樹着一座光明的燈塔。</p>
<p>風勢更加　厲起　了，然而不久便和緩下來。蒼鬰的松林裏還有風聲在微嘯，天空的風雲在飛馳。</p>
<p>已月亮經露出他的臉蛋。濃厚的雲層，還想掙扎。强烈的光輝和雲層在不斷交戰。在那化光照澈了的河岸上，我踏着地上的樹技的黑影，望着黑雲逐漸　消滅。</p>
<p>滿火繁星，照在林莽，荒墳，河岸和水面，一片光明！我歡呼，我頂禮，向着星空。</p>
<h3>他決心當一名射手！</h3>
<p>— 胡考</p>
<p>平坦的沙灘上</p>
<p>掀起大風暴的巨響</p>
<p>帶來血腥和火藥混雜的氣味</p>
<p>滿佈了</p>
<p>村野</p>
<p>田莊</p>
<p>山谷</p>
<p>——每塊土壤。</p>
<p>不再是我們幻夢裏底桃源了</p>
<p>這亞熱帶茂密的果圃</p>
<p>遠處</p>
<p>馳騁廣埸的牛羊</p>
<p>是夏夜數不盡的星星</p>

<p>海南</p>
<p>有我眞摯底友人</p>
<p>他叫我別為他底安全操心</p>
<p>在游擊隊伍裏</p>
<p>他　心當一名射手</p>
<p>這得鍛成鎢鋼般剛强與堅韌</p>
<p>雖然我們的堅韌</p>
<p>目前還不足以阻止×人前進</p>
<p>但「死亡」不能轉移他的意志</p>
<p>奔迸的「血流」</p>
<p>正是新中國底培養夜。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒群</p>
<p>而她和　的視綫相接而成　一直線的時候，她感覺他的眼睛閃射着魔鬼的電火，而她的眼睛被刺得盲然了　用兩手本能地把面掩藏起來。驚呌了一聲。</p>
<p>這叫聲，引起他一種無情的暴性，彷彿眞地變成了個猙惡的魔鬼，　惜在這宇宙間留下最大的罪惡；縱然，他預感了明日自己不免懺悔，或是別人懲罰：但是，他絕不逃　，或放棄今　這罪人之責。他想放槍；他的理性卻阻止他：</p>
<p>「你的手槍，不是傷害她的！」</p>
<p>於是，他祗有張大着眼睛，閉緊着嘴唇，從衣袋里，摸出了手槍，威嚇她不許做聲，他……</p>
<p>「你做聲的時候，你要小心……」</p>
<p>但是，她本能地哭了，哭出聲來。這哭聲，就是弱者的反抗。</p>
<p>他為了自己的安全和工作的成功，不得不用手帕堵　　他的喉嚨，使她瘠啞了；好像讓她替代自己多活的女僕，弭補着缺點。他又說：</p>
<p>「你辭去的時候，　要小心自己　生命！」</p>
<p>然後，他的話，對於她，便是最權威的命令了。</p>
<p>她順從着從，祗有眼淚，而沒有哭聲了。她的脚底，有着一種均勻的彈力；使她的全身抖動着。一個弱者，在她生命失去主宰的時候，骨肉都是軟化了的，祇有讓一縷呼吸，在喘息中，延長着活力。她好像是燕群中被遺下的一隻雛燕，在廣闊的高空，失去方向，向不可知的遠方，茫然的飛行，雖然，它已經預知了自己未來的歸宿，是不幸的小巢；但是，它也祗有把自己的一切，交與命運。一個人讓命運决定的時候，就是海上丢了舵的舟，任風，任浪，隨便引走；就是郊外無主人的野塚，永無一人繼承而看守，可以任人摧毀。她順從地換了鞋仔，又穿着衣服。不過，她故意慢慢地扣著衣扣，地希望以衣扣延長一些時間，使她在這往日已經厭了的臥室，再多有一刻的勾留；其間。或有　隻援救的手，撞破牆壁，把她拖走，拖到幸福之地。幻恐，誰說不美麗？但是，誰說幻想能够美麗得長久？所以她不過加深自己原有的苦痛而已。　（十一）</p>

<h3>China on the Front Lines of Defending World Peace</h3>
<p>The twenty months of Japan's war of aggression against China—what has it gained? The facts have already given us a clear answer: the use of two-thirds of its army, navy, and air force combat power and the elimination of more than one-third; the exhaustion of its finances and economy; and the widespread war-weariness and anti-war sentiment among its soldiers and people. In contrast, our country has seen the solidifying of national unity, the strengthening of combat power, the development of transportation in the rear, the increase in production, and, above all, the surge in national hatred of the enemy—all the opposite of the Japanese. From this, the future of our victory and the Japanese defeat is predetermined. All the Japanese's hypocritical propaganda can no longer cover up the ironclad facts, and has long been clearly pointed out by informed people around the world, requiring no further detailed explanation. However, the question of what tragic situation the Japanese's few warlords and plutocrats are ultimately leading the entire Japanese people into is precisely what concerns us.</p>
<p>Why did the few Japanese warlords and plutocrats launch this war of aggression? In my article "Why We Fight," published shortly after the outbreak of the war, I clearly pointed out that all the Japanese's professed reasons were nothing more than deceptive talk; the real reason was driven by the mad mentality and erroneous thinking of the Japanese military, who dreamed of realizing the crazy delusions in the Tanaka Memorial. The Tanaka Memorial advocated conquering the world. However, conquering the world must begin with conquering China. It can be seen that Japan's invasion of China is all a hypocritical cover-up, and conquering the world is its real purpose. Conquering the world is not only intolerable to public justice, but from its own manpower, material resources, and financial resources, this mere island nation does not have the strength and qualifications—it is predetermined from the start. However, the mad mentality of the Japanese warlords drives them unconsciously. Although their mad mentality and erroneous thinking are innately destined to fail to realize their pipe dreams, they have the ability to disrupt world peace, at least disrupt East Asian peace. In the twenty months since, the ravaging of our country's provinces and regions, the killing of tens of millions of people, the occupation of urban transportation lines, and the plunder of property and resources constitute the sole tragedy in history. At the same time, the destruction of various countries' commerce in the Far East, the robbery of overseas Chinese's property, and even the loss of protection for various countries' envoys and warships in China have attracted the attention of the world, all focused on this East Asian battlefield. Although the results they have obtained prove that they are digging their own graves, their delusion has not been awakened. Their erroneous thinking has not been corrected. The fact that Japan disregarded everything last month and attacked Hainan Island is enough to prove that it is taking a further risk and making a desperate gamble.</p>
<p>Hainan Island is an isolated island off our Leizhou Peninsula, unrelated to the war situation on the mainland. If Japan's war of aggression against China is limited to conquering China, then the decisive battle should be fought on the mainland. Because the naval force is not needed on the mainland battlefield, since the start of the war, the loss of Japanese combat power has still leaned towards the army and air force. The elite of the navy has been preserved. Since the army and air force have encountered strong enemies on the mainland and cannot fulfill their wishes, according to its consistent policy of conquering the world, it has had to use its last navy to attack the world. Hainan Island is west of Annam, north of Guangzhou Bay, and faces the Philippines across the South China Sea. It is sufficient to control the South China Sea and the Tokyo Bay, and to threaten Annam and the Philippines; it also cuts off the sea route between Hong Kong and Singapore, which is sufficient to influence the entire western Pacific situation. From Japan's point of view, Hainan Island is the southern gateway of Japan, passing from Sakhalin Island through Japan's mainland and Taiwan. When the United States announced its defense in Guam, Japan's move to occupy Hainan Island was tantamount to giving the United States an answer in action, tantamount to telling the United States clearly that the area from west of Honolulu to east of Singapore has long been a planned territory of Japan. The day after Japan attacked Hainan Island, Chairman Chiang clearly pointed out that Japan's attack on Hainan Island is "no different from the September 18th Incident in the Pacific." In one sentence, the ambition of Japan to conquer the world can be said to be completely exposed. In the past, when the Tanaka Memorial was discovered, although the general public was shocked, they generally thought it was just a kind of mad talk. The September 18th Incident broke out and actually ignited the flames of war in the Far East. Those with shallow views still regarded it as a local event in the Far East and did not pay attention to it. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, there were still many countries in the world watching. At this stage, Japan's ferocious face can be said to be completely exposed. It tells the world in action that its invasion of China is the first part of conquering the world.</p>
<p>Our Chinese heroic resistance for the past twenty months is undoubtedly for the independence of the Republic of China and the free survival of the Chinese nation. However, from the perspective of the entire world, it is also taking on the role of defending the front lines of world peace. The world needs peace, and countries have already learned a general lesson from the previous European war. The organization of the League of Nations and the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact were all set up to avoid the cruelty of war. However, the ambitions of a few ambitious people are not happy unless they drive humanity to bloodshed. At present, there is certainly more than one country in the world that deliberately creates war. However, the first shot was fired by Japan in the September 18th Incident. At that time, our country did not have the strength to resist due to internal problems; however, if all countries in the world could take a long-term view and uphold justice, the situation later would certainly not have deteriorated so much. Even the Treaty of Versailles would not have been torn up, Abyssinia would not have been destroyed, and the civil war in Spain for more than two years would not have occurred. We know that ambitious people will not be satisfied. The fact that China did not fire a single shot in the September 18th Incident and gave up the four northeastern provinces cannot satisfy Japan, just as the sacrifice of Austria and Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Abyssinia by European countries cannot satisfy Germany and Italy. The problem will only get tighter and tighter. Only resistance with strength, or the union of peace-loving countries to implement effective sanctions, can have a practical effect. The long-term war between China and Japan since the Lugou Bridge Incident has already given the most reasonable answer to the Japanese ambitious people; and the insatiable demands of Germany and Italy have also aroused widespread awakening in European and American countries. Recently, the close cooperation between Britain and France, and between Britain and the United States, has already begun, which is sufficient to give Germany and Italy a considerable warning. However, what we cannot ignore is that several ambitious people in the world are carrying out a union. Although there are many contradictions between them, they can at least echo each other. Therefore, peace-loving countries in the world will eventually need to unite. Only by uniting can the attempt of ambitious people to defeat them one by one be fundamentally eliminated. In this hopeful union, undoubtedly our China will still take on the front line.</p>
<p>In Europe, the reason why Germany and Italy are rampant can be said that they completely exploited the war-averse mentality of Europeans. Because the lessons of the last war are still deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public. Therefore, the reason why Germany and Italy can achieve victory is half due to threats and half due to fraud. In the Far East, Japan has fortunately won the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War since the Meiji Restoration, which has led to their arrogant mentality and has long put no one in their eyes. Without giving them a serious blow, they will not wake up. The mad talk about conquering the world in the Tanaka Memorial was born because of this. Since our China is the first target for Japanese ambitious people to conquer the world, the size of our country's land, the abundance of our products, and the sufficiency of our manpower are sufficient to resist Japan and more. This can already be proved by the past twenty months of battles. However, in order to shorten the process of the war and reduce cruel sacrifices, peace-loving countries in the world need to unite as soon as possible. We can say that this kind of union, while its direct purpose is to assist China, all countries have the same obligation to maintain world peace and ensure their own security. In the past, all countries were bound by facts, and although they have given our country a lot of sympathy in morality, they have not yet been able to achieve unity in action. Recently, countries such as Britain and the United States, which have relatively close relations with the Far East, have gradually become consistent, which is enough to give our country a lot of excitement. Now, the Japanese ambitious people are taking a further step to implement the second step of their conquest of the world. Therefore, we have to clearly point out Japan's ambition and further hope that all countries in the world will work hard for their own safety and jointly extinguish this destroyer of world peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Baili said: "There is no one in the world who sympathizes with the Japanese as much as I do." I think this should be the common feeling of every humanitarian. In terms of various conditions, Japan not only does not have the qualifications to conquer the world, not only should not recklessly claim to be the master of East Asia, but should also live very cautiously on its island country. How fortunate to be Japanese, establishing a country between the three great peace-loving countries of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. He actually does not know how to be satisfied and launched this large-scale war of aggression. In the twenty months of war, he used two-thirds of his army, navy, and air force and consumed one-third of his army, navy, and air force's strength; if he knew it was difficult and retreated, it would not be difficult to maintain his position as a small country in East Asia. He should be deeply grateful for the most reasonable lesson we gave him. Unexpectedly, he is now going a step further and extending his evil hand to the western Pacific with his only remaining navy. When the world's peace forces are becoming increasingly united today, his future is difficult to imagine. I think that in the near future, he will go a step further and deeply regret that he should not have received the lessons we gave him in China!</p>
<h3>A Week of World Trends</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From March 12th to 18th</p>
<p>Tension! Serious! Critical! Chaotic!</p>
<p>Lamenting! Wailing! Raging! Cheering!</p>
<p>A historical tragedy! A disgrace to humanity!</p>
<p>The past week can be regarded as the most serious and chaotic week in the international situation since the New Year. In Europe, the Czech Republic completely perished due to its compromise halfway through resisting the war, the arrogance of the German invaders became even higher, the situation in Britain and France became more dangerous, and the call from the Soviet Union and the United States for "uniting to defend democracy and peace" gained widespread response amidst the all-encompassing war clouds in Europe. In the Far East, Japanese invaders, taking advantage of the serious situation in the West, seized the opportunity to "fish in troubled waters," creating a facade of "launching a major offensive against the Soviet Union" while stepping up preparations to conquer all of China by invading the Southwest. As for our country, in this chaotic world, under the common demand of "strengthening national unity and persevering in the war of resistance," we continue to make progress in military, political, and popular movements. Although difficulties remain serious, the future is brighter.</p>
<p>The Complete Subjugation of Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia was a newly emerging republic in Europe after the Great War, formed by combining Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, formerly parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, covering an area of more than 140,300 square kilometers with a population of approximately 14,728,000. In foreign affairs, it followed France's lead and also concluded agreements with Romania and Yugoslavia, the so-called Little Entente, to consolidate its international position. However, with the Munich Agreement last September, the French Daladier government, following Chamberlain's policy of appeasement, exchanged the partition of Czechoslovakia for the German invaders' guarantee of peace in Europe. Small countries such as Romania and Yugoslavia were even more alarmed by the wavering of France's policy on which they relied, unable to take care of themselves. The Czech government also suppressed the people's enthusiasm for resisting the war, accepting international mediation and implementing a compromise halfway through. At that time, Czechoslovakia was given nominal independence, but all appeasement policies only invited destruction. The German invaders, seeing that the resistance in Spain was gradually being suppressed under the appeasement policies of Britain and France, immediately seized the opportunity to advance, with military mobilization and diplomatic conspiracies proceeding simultaneously, tearing up the Munich Agreement that had not yet dried, which "guaranteed Czech independence," resulting in the historical tragedy of Czechoslovakia perishing without a fight on the fifteenth of this month.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth, Hitler triumphantly entered Prague, and on the sixteenth, he issued a declaration annexing Czechoslovakia. The current state of "Czechoslovakia" is: (1) The Slovak region declared "independence," but in reality, it has become a vassal of Germany, a European version of Manchukuo, with everything subject to the control of the German invaders. (2) The Ruthenian region has also declared "independence," but it is still being contested by Hungarian and Polish forces. There are also rumors of Polish involvement. If it is annexed by Hungary, then Hungary and Poland will border each other, and the possibility of preventing direct conflict between German forces will depend on the relationship between Italy and Germany. (3) The two wealthy provinces of Bohemia and Moravia remaining in Czechoslovakia have become German provinces. Military, political, and financial affairs are all managed by commissioners appointed by Germany, and the Nuremberg Jewish Laws are being implemented immediately. The Czech Republic has now completely perished. Here, we hope that those compatriots who are happy to see the arguments of "anti-communism," "peace advocacy," "compromise halfway through," and "international mediation" will open their eyes and see the painful history of the Czech Republic's demise under the policies of "anti-communism," "peace advocacy," "compromise halfway through," and "international mediation"!</p>
<p>New Developments in British, French, and American Military</p>
<p>From the drastic changes in the Spanish war situation to the demise of the Czech Republic, on the one hand, it created a more superior reputation for the fascist aggressors, Germany and Italy, and on the other hand, it forced the democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain and France to further decline in the world. At the same time, it also advanced the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle worldwide to a stage of intense development, forcing the democratic and peaceful front to consolidate and expand. In Britain and France, political parties representing the hard-working masses and the vast population seeking freedom unanimously opposed the appeasement policy of helping the aggressors harm others and themselves, and launched practical struggles extensively from parliamentary demonstrations and marches. The British and French governments were also forced to adopt a tougher stance. On the seventeenth, a London dispatch stated that Britain and France had agreed to recall their ambassadors to Germany, expressing their protest against Germany's breach of contract. Chamberlain also had to vehemently denounce Germany for endangering peace in Birmingham on the seventeenth, stating that Britain would do its best to resist the enemy's challenge; Halifax is also planning to organize a national cabinet, calling on all parties to participate, including former Foreign Secretary Eden and Conservative Churchill. At the same time, the government also expressed sympathy for the proposal to implement conscription to strengthen Britain's attitude towards Germany. Rumors that Chamberlain will resign and promote British-Soviet relations have been flooding in. On the French side, the anti-fascist and anti-aggression people's front led by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party has gained new development. Daladier decided to go to Britain within days to discuss how to deal with the new crisis situation. French Foreign Minister Bonnet also declared that France should maintain close relations with the Soviet Union and Poland today. He has consulted with the Soviet ambassador many times, and Poland has repeatedly expressed its desire for Britain and France to cooperate with the Soviet Union. As for the United States, since the news of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia spread, the political circles have become more uneasy about the international war clouds. President Roosevelt's attitude of strengthening the peace front to resist fascist aggression has become even tougher. Undersecretary of State Welles formally declared on the seventeenth the United States' determination to severely condemn Germany's aggressive atrocities. The Senate's opposition to the government's attitude has gradually weakened. The chairman of the House Labor Committee proposed to cancel the trade agreement with Czechoslovakia and demanded that Germany bear the huge debt of 165 million yuan owed by Czechoslovakia. In addition to the 270 million yuan to expand the Panama Canal locks, Roosevelt will also propose to Congress to allocate 5 million yuan to develop the defense of the port of Guam. These facts prove that the democratic and peaceful countries have a further tendency to awaken and unite to resist fascist aggression. Our task today is to call on and unite the anti-fascist masses around the world, promote the policy of the British and French governments uniting with the United States and the Soviet Union, and prevent their attempts to limit themselves to compromising with domestic opposition.</p>
<p>Serious Soviet-Japanese Conflict</p>
<p>At this time of extreme crisis in Europe, Soviet-Japanese relations are also unprecedentedly tense. In the past, the fundamental cause of Soviet-Japanese conflicts was not communism, but a Japanese conspiracy to ease domestic anti-war sentiment, to ease the movement of powerful nations restricting Japan, to divert attention from our country's war of resistance against Japan, and to carry out its steps to intensify the conquest of our country. This time, the Soviet-Japanese fishing zone dispute was actually justified on the Soviet side. If the Japanese side had genuine sincerity for peace, it could have been resolved long ago, but precisely because Japan has the above-mentioned conspiracy, it continues to maintain a tense state. However, since the fifteenth of this month, the Soviet Union has adhered to a tough attitude of defending peace and justice, rejecting all unreasonable demands from Japan, and implementing the auction of Sakhalin Island fishing rights. If Japan does not fight, it will yield, and it can no longer continue its past conspiracies. According to continuous telegraphic reports, Japan has been creating a "war against the Soviet Union" situation. According to a Shanghai dispatch on the seventeenth, the Japanese army recently departed from Japan, Korea, and headed to "Manchuria." The Japanese sources are running to northern Manchuria, with an estimated force of about 100,000, approaching Qinglv Port near Zhanggufeng, and has announced the prohibition of merchant ships from entering and exiting. The northern Manchurian railway from Harbin to Manchuria has been automatically destroyed. According to another foreign intelligence report, it is said that in the past two weeks, the Japanese army secretly withdrew from China and headed to Manchuria, reaching about 600,000 people. Recently, the Japanese air force in various war zones in China has been very active, and its purpose is to cover the retreat of the transport team. We must maintain a reserved attitude towards this kind of news until there is factual evidence. At the same time, we should have the following basic understandings: (1) Japan's full-scale invasion of China militarily has no chance of victory, and it has no power to simultaneously conduct wars against China and the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union's political and economic advances are a guarantee that its military is sufficient to defeat any aggressor. The Far Eastern Red Army's powerful performance in the Battle of Zhanggufeng has been great, and its progress has been rapid in the months since. Soviet Far East Army Commander Stern's report at the recent All-Union Congress proves that the Far Eastern Red Army is superior to the Japanese army in every aspect. Before Japan wins its invasion of China, it has no courage and determination to truly fight against the Soviet Union. (3) The Soviet Union's recent tough attitude towards Japan and its strong strength in the Far East are the most powerful aid to our country's war of resistance against Japan. We must not easily believe the recent rumors. We should take this opportunity to intensify the fighting force of the front line and the large-scale launch of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines from a strategic perspective. (4) We must also pay attention to the fact that Japan is clamoring to fight against the Soviet Union at all costs, but in reality, it is eager for Soviet entanglement and reconciliation. Be vigilant against its new strategy against China, especially the Southwest, and be vigilant against its preparations for a military general offensive and its conspiracies for political peace and compromise.</p>
<p>A Week of War of Resistance Situation</p>
<p>In the anti-Japanese war of resistance in the past week, the overall situation has not changed significantly. First, the once-tense war in central Hubei has weakened the enemy's momentum since our army began a counterattack against the flanks of the Japanese army last week. In the unprecedented bloody battle on the Jingzhong Road alone, the Japanese army suffered more than 8,000 deaths. Although our army withdrew from Zhongxiang, it immediately increased its reinforcements, launched a large-scale counterattack, and closely surrounded Zhongxiang, and sent four divisions to bypass the north of Zhongxiang to harass the enemy's rear. The two sides continue to face off. Second, south of the Yangtze River, the enemy continued to attempt to cut off our Zhejiang-Hunan Road from Zhejiang and Anhui, and to take Nanchang and Changsha from the south, but made no progress. Fierce battles east of Poyang Lake have continued until a cessation is sought; the area from the southern Xun Road to the north of the Xiu River on the west bank has been constantly punished by our guerrillas. Third, the war situation in the north is also in a stalemate. The enemy's three-pronged attempt to seize Jingle and invade the Northwest has been defeated by us. This is due to the remarkable effect of our implementation of the scorched-earth strategy, the enemy's rear being attacked and reinforcements being insufficient, and the enemy's cadres and troops being wiped out by more than a thousand successively; now our morale is becoming more and more prosperous. As for the enemy who committed the crime from the three routes of Fenyang, Taiyuan, and Yangqu, they have also been frustrated by our counterattack from the rear. There are continuous mixed battles in other parts of Chahar, Hebei, Henan, and Henan. After our counterattack in northern Jiangsu, the situation in Huaiyin is unclear, the enemy's momentum has weakened again, and the chairman of Heilongjiang, Ma Zhanshan, has led 30,000 cavalrymen of the newly trained Eastern Province, departing from Suiyuan on an "Eastern Expedition" and preparing to return to Heilongjiang to take office: morale is like clouds, invincible, and now arriving in the western border of Rehe, except for a road of puppet troops surrendering to the wind, they have not encountered resistance! Fourth, the situation in South China has been particularly tense in the past week. This matter is related to the compromising policy of the country and Britain and France in Europe, granting the Japanese army the opportunity to further scare and plunder. According to our army's intelligence in Shaoguan on the sixteenth, the Japanese army generals in South China recently met somewhere and planned to increase three more divisions to the incident and invade the South Road, and prepared to deal with the international problems that may be caused by the invasion of Hainan Island. According to the military report from Guilin, the enemy has recently attempted to attack Yangjiang and Dianbai, and a major battle in the south is imminent. As for the war situation on each front, our garrison on Hainan Island is still fighting hard. The former Red Army, in addition to bravely resisting the enemy, has also actively mobilized the masses and trained the Li and Miao people to prepare for a protracted war of resistance, so as to cooperate with the overall war of resistance; to consume and contain the enemy. Within Guangdong Province, the enemy still only defends points and lines in the occupied areas. Recently, they have tried to eliminate our guerrillas in each area, and used Wang Jingwei's anti-communist and peace talks, and distributed the XX Daily published in Hong Kong and other pro-peace and anti-communist traitor publications. To assist its poisonous appeasement policy, in order to consolidate its ruling power and facilitate its use of pseudo-laws to conscript money and goods and conscript strong men and women. However, because our political work has gradually extended into the occupied areas, the anti-traitor movement has made progress every day. Since April, the enemy has made no progress. The reason why they have been actively acting recently is probably to try to save their political failure by military offensive. We hope that the compatriots in South China who mistakenly believe that they have a peaceful life under the sun will be vigilant about this.</p>
<p>Important Military Meeting</p>
<p>Since the anti-Japanese war turned to the first phase, the situation between our army and the enemy has begun to undergo major changes. On the enemy's side, in order to break our protracted war strategy, on the one hand, they have intensified directing national traitors and pro-Japanese elements to promote "anti-communism" and "peace talks" in speech and action, in order to alienate our unity and undermine our anger. On the one hand, in the economy, they have adopted both appeasement and plunder, intensifying the robbery in the occupied areas. In the military, they have changed their combat policy, changing from central cities to using our army as their combat target; this is because (1) the enemy has too few troops to completely defeat us; (2) the year-and-a-half of combat experience has proved that the Chinese people are difficult to subdue even under the enemy's rape, looting, and massacre, so they are trying to break our main force; (3) the year-and-a-half of combat experience has proved that it is impossible to make us surrender without occupying vast rural areas, so they are trying to find our army everywhere to fight and clear their rear, restore the poisonous plan of using the Chinese to continue to attack and conquer our country. In response to this conspiracy of the enemy, it can be seen that we must develop the guerrilla war in the enemy's rear to stop the enemy's offensive: only by stopping the enemy's offensive can we cultivate new forces to prepare for a counteroffensive and conduct a decisive battle, and only by implementing a counteroffensive and conducting a decisive battle can we restore our land and build our country. For the sake of the new environment and new needs, we will convene a high-level military meeting recently. According to a director who presided over this meeting, this meeting decided on the positive side to use the precise tactics of a comprehensive main track war and the spirit of dying to intensify the steps to lash out at the Japanese enemy on the front line and in the rear. Militarily, it was decided to bravely defeat the main force of the enemy, and at the same time, to implement the National Covenant method to smash the Japanese enemy's political tricks, and then to use economic and blockade methods to prohibit Japanese goods from being transported into the interior, and not to allow our food products to be transported into the enemy-occupied areas. On the passive side, we must consolidate various political and cultural forces, in order to cooperate with the revolutionary tactics of the face. Politically, it was decided to strengthen political institutions at all levels and consolidate revolutionary political institutions in the war zone, in order to mobilize the anti-Japanese forces of the vast masses. Culturally, it was decided to increase the work of anti-Japanese culture and promote the national spirit, in order to enhance revolutionary emotions. In terms of personnel, it was decided to first recommend the virtuous and capable. In terms of principle, it was decided to be honest and serve the public. Finally, a simple, effective method of leading troops, training troops, and using troops was formulated. After this military meeting, there will be important progress in the entire future of the war of resistance. "For detailed comments, please refer to this newspaper's special commentary on the 15th of this month, "Detailed Review of New Military Decisions on the War of Resistance." At the same time, in order to mobilize the financial and economic forces of the whole country to serve the war of resistance, a National Financial Conference was recently convened and successfully concluded, establishing a unified anti-Japanese front in the financial community and actively striving to realize the financial and economic policies during the period of the war of resistance and national construction. (Please refer to this newspaper's editorial on the 17th of this month, "Current Financial and Economic Problems.")</p>
<p>National Spiritual Mobilization</p>
<p>To highly develop national self-esteem and self-confidence, persist in resisting the war to the end, overcome pessimistic emotions, oppose compromise attempts; and support the supreme leader, support the central government, support Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, oppose divisions and splits, oppose any traitorous government: it is the urgent task of the whole nation at the current stage to stop the enemy's offensive, prepare our army's counter-offensive, and strive for the final victory of the war of resistance. Chairman Chiang specially telegraphed the whole country on the 12th of this month (the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Eastern national revolution), calling on the sons and daughters of China. "To implement spiritual mobilization and swear to implement the National Covenant is, of course, to ask the whole country to shoulder the current urgent task together." The central government's National Spiritual Mobilization Program and its implementation measures have been published in various newspapers. We have specially listed three simple and clear common goals that are easy for everyone to know and practice: (1) The state is supreme, the nation is supreme, (2) Military first, victory first, (3) Concentration of will, concentration of strength, in order to promote the consistent acceptance of the people of the country, correct the life of drunkenness and death, cultivate the energetic spirit of development, eliminate the habits of living in peace, break the attempts of selfishness and self-interest, correct the thoughts of division and miscellaneous thoughts, and not violate the highest principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, and use the heart and strength of the whole country to dedicate to the cause of resisting the war and building the country. Various circles in various places have risen up to respond, making people feel the great and bright future of the country and the nation. However, in order to truly transition all the lively forces across the whole territory, and to practically focus on serving the cause of resisting the war and building the country, we believe that the first thing is to intensify the implementation of a democratic government with centralized leadership, so that the connection between the government and the people is closer, and the greatest strength of the anti-Japanese government can be brought into play. The great achievements of the National Political Participation Council, the only representative body of public opinion in the country, in holding three congresses have broken the cold attitude of a few people in the government and the general public towards the council, and it is recognized that it is sufficient to mobilize the strength of the whole people to assist the government, strive for the victory of the war of resistance, and lay the foundation for building a new China with democratic politics based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. It is even more necessary to speed up the establishment of the provincial and municipal councils as soon as possible, so as to become the true representative bodies of public opinion in all localities, carry forward the spirit of the National Political Participation Council, and complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country. Secondly, it is also necessary to expand and unify various mass movements, the main thing is to guarantee the freedom of all anti-Japanese mass groups and mass movements, and to establish the place of mass groups in law: it is necessary to create groups of peasants, youth, women, merchants and cultural circles, etc., to serve the war of resistance and national construction, and to unite and unify them according to region or occupation, and under the leadership of the government, do their best to assist the war of resistance and national construction.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Japanese Liberals (III)</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Herzel</p>
<p>Originally Published in "Asia Magazine"</p>
<p>They have received the assistance of the royal family, and perhaps even the military can be commanded by them. Now, although Japan's army and navy must select from the active servicemen and obtain the consent of both the army and the navy in advance, the Japanese emperor does not necessarily have to approve everyone they propose. Therefore, with the legal power that liberals possess in parliament, coupled with their potential influence inside and outside the government and next to the emperor, it is not difficult to break the current situation of military and police rule.</p>
<p>The undercurrent of the wheel is roughly like this, but it does not necessarily have the hope of realization. Once they encounter the attack of the stubborn fascists, they retreat without a fight, some go back to their hometowns, and some close their doors and remain silent. The debate at the last parliament was no less than a matter of face. Although they made impassioned speeches in the meeting place, everyone knew that as long as the government insisted on passing the budget, they would have to pass it. The result was that it really passed.</p>
<p>But this kind of retreat is not that simple. We cannot expect ordinary intellectuals to fight with the military and police. If a few old and infirm people really take out rusty pistols and fire a few shots, it will naturally be enough to spread the word for a lifetime, but what is the difference between that and suicide? The weapons of liberals, in Japan and elsewhere, are not power and guns at all.</p>
<p>A Japanese intellectual has obviously been influenced by international thought, has constant contact with foreigners, or has traveled around the world, but he is still a Japanese after all. There is no way to change the characteristics of his nation. Rousseau, Tolstoy, and Marx can only scratch his skin, but cannot change his arrogance. When you meet a semi-official Japanese propagandist or the leader of a Japanese business delegation in New York, you can treat him as another person. Because when he returns to Japan, he bows to thousands of idols or silk-wrapped gods and Buddhas, and when he becomes an official, he immediately runs to the shrine to report. When he returns home, he reads the newly published novel by Marno. He does not feel funny about these activities, but this dualism, constantly moving between the extremes of two spiritual lives, always makes a Japanese liberal feel bitter.</p>
<p>Japan is now desperately trying to restore the thoughts of the pre-Meiji era, which is of course contrary to liberalism. Since the two ideas cannot be reconciled, the result is that liberalism is silenced. Now, Japanese liberals have actually become so-called peace advocates. They think, but not necessarily, that they are hopeless. They still hope to realize their ideas, but now that national unity is so important, it is impossible for them to fight the fascist enemy.</p>
<p>The Japanese military is now going crazy, and only the minds of the liberals are still a little clearer. At this time, they need to come out and take on everything, to take on the responsibility of casting Japan's future, but they have given up this right. When people outside us rise up, they have lost their historical mission. In the future, when the people of Japan re-ignite the hope of freedom and happiness and revolt behind bayonets, they will no longer ask the liberals to lead them. (The End)</p>

<h3>Bloody Battle on Both Sides of the Xiang River; Our Large Army is Reinforcing in Multiple Routes; Major Victory in Surprise Attack on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] We are making favorable progress on all fronts. According to a telegram from Xiangyang, our troops achieved a major victory in a surprise attack on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway yesterday. They stormed into Xinyang Airport and Liulin, Jigongshan, and other places, burned and destroyed four or five aircraft, destroyed many sections of railway, and killed a large number of enemy troops, including their garrison commander, Yong Guangfu. After completing our mission, our troops safely returned to their original positions. In the Hubei Central theater, the enemy is taking a defensive posture in the areas of Zhongxiang and north of Yangzi Town, while shifting their main force south, attempting to cross the river at the opposite bank of Shayang or at Yuekou. For days, they have been harassing us, but have been repelled. As of the 18th, we are still fighting across the river. Our large army is reinforcing in multiple routes, and a major turning point will occur within days.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] In the past sixty hours, the Japanese army in central Hubei has collected a large number of civilian boats and rubber rafts in an attempt to forcibly cross the Xiang River, using heavy artillery to provide cover, but all attempts have failed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yichang, 17th Dispatch] The enemy who attempted to sneak across the river into Sigang City in central Hubei has been completely annihilated by our forces.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] A telegram from Xi'an reports that the enemy is continuing to attack our guerrillas in the occupied areas. Clashes between the Communist and Nationalist forces in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, and Shandong provinces remain intense.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] A telegram from Shaanxi reports that our troops achieved a major victory in attacking Lishi in Shanxi. All important locations southwest of the county have been recovered. More than two hundred enemies at Jiaokou and more than one hundred at Hejiata have been annihilated. Lijiawan has been cleared, and more than ten enemy pillboxes have been destroyed by our forces. The enemy suffered more than three hundred casualties, leaving behind the bodies of four officers and over one hundred soldiers on the battlefield, as well as over one hundred thousand rounds of ammunition and a large amount of other military supplies. Our attack on the county town is underway.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chang'an, 17th Dispatch] The enemy at Baibao, northwest of Mancheng, were attacked and fled back to Mancheng on the 12th. Baibao has been recaptured by our forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th Dispatch] The enemy landing at Pingfeng Mountain seems to be attempting to cut off the communication of our Lushan guerrillas and ensure the safety of navigation on Poyang Lake, with no intention of in-depth advancement. The enemy attacking Xugang Bridge and Laoyemiao has greatly decreased. A small number of enemy troops were discovered on the Tiger Mountain side on the 15th and engaged in combat with our forces.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Observes the War Situation; The Enemy Has Lost the Ability to Invade; Our Military Strength in Jiangnan Is Extremely Strong; Guangxi Will Become the Second Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] American news reporter Belden, who recently traveled through Central and Southern China, has just returned to Shanghai. According to general estimates by Chinese army officers, the Japanese army will not be able to launch another major offensive until next year. While the United States and others have not been able to determine Japan's subsequent actions, it is believed that Tokyo's primary concern today is to exert pressure on Britain and France to force China to end its resistance. If this fails, the Japanese army may begin an invasion of northern Yunnan, in order to cut off China's communications with the outside world.</p>
<p>If the Japanese army invades Guangxi, the province may become "the second Shanxi." In addition to the difficult terrain of Guangxi, the Japanese army will also encounter the firm resistance of the populace. The people of Guangxi are preparing to cope with any eventuality. As a precaution, important highways in the province have been greatly damaged, using methods like diverting rivers to submerge the roads. While this measure may not prevent the Japanese invasion, it will slow down their advance. Another measure taken by the province is to relocate the residents within five miles of the highways to other places, and to fully prepare for a second relocation upon receiving notice.</p>
<p>In the Third and Fourth War Zones south of the Yangtze River, there are one hundred divisions of Chinese regular and guerrilla forces, totaling one million men, standing in strict formation. In that area, there has been very little Japanese military activity for many days.</p>
<p>The guerrillas and regular forces in southern Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces have been reorganized, with an estimated strength of 150,000 men. Soon, they may become more active, especially around the Taihu Lake area. This area is under the command of General Gu Zhutong. After the Chinese army withdrew in the winter of 1937, he consolidated his troops. Although the area under Gu's command is not currently strategically important, it may become more important as the war progresses. Similarly, Zeng Guofan retreated to this area during the Taiping Rebellion, reorganized his troops, and ten years later, he led his troops and inflicted a fatal blow to the rebel army. Given that Nanjing, the economic and military base of the Japanese army and the seat of the puppet regime, is not far from this area, the area's importance is further increased.</p>
<p>Belden believes that Gu Zhutong is the most capable and loyal of Chiang Kai-shek's subordinates. The 87th Division, 88th Division, and later the 36th Division, which were formed from Gu's old troops, are among the most elite units of the Central Army. After Gu and his troops retreated to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area, many officers were sent to the interior for special training for half a year. During this period, they participated in combat exercises and received strategic training, using the training ground as a battlefield laboratory. Gu's troops have established several guerrilla areas. On the south bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, there are currently about 150,000 guerrillas, and new troops are joining and gradually strengthening them. The commander of all the guerrillas in Jiangsu Province is Leng Xin, a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, who will soon serve as a division commander in the Central Army and also concurrently serves as the civil affairs official of the area managed by his troops. Leng told Belden that the reorganization of the guerrillas has been completed and that mobile warfare in the area is expected to increase significantly. He also invited Belden to inspect his area of administration, but Belden declined due to a prior appointment.</p>
<p>Belden criticized the guerrilla situation, saying that it is a mistake to believe that the Chinese army has now completely switched to guerrilla warfare, and it is not in line with the facts. According to his estimate, of the one million soldiers in the Third War Zone he passed through, no more than 150,000 have been reorganized into guerrillas. Most guerrillas are reorganized and operated by officers who have received special training in the rear for half a year. Therefore, Belden believes that the activities of guerrillas in the guerrilla areas will increase.</p>

<h3>Shanghai International Settlement; Searches Bookstores; Confiscates the Book "Japanese Spies"; Foreign Merchants Are Dissatisfied with the Enemy's Arbitrary Detention of Passengers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that at 2:00 PM on the 17th, political detectives from the Special Branch of the Shanghai International Settlement, together with more than ten plainclothes personnel from the Japanese side, searched various bookstores and magazine companies on Fourth Avenue. The book "Japanese Spies," which was sold on consignment by the Shanghai Magazine Company and other stores, was completely confiscated. One or two copies of each of the other magazines were taken away. The search lasted for two hours before it was completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that the enemy is using Japanese security personnel to inspect foreign merchant ships and arbitrarily detain passengers, which has aroused great dissatisfaction among foreign merchants here. British shipping companies have reported to the government, requesting protests to Japan and effective assistance to customs to stop the illegal actions of the Japanese side. American companies will also take unified steps.</p>
<p>Dense Gunfire Heard in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that on the mornings of the 16th and 17th, residents in western Shanghai heard clear and dense gunfire. On the afternoon of the 17th, an enemy aircraft flew from south to northwest. People believe it was caused by our guerrilla units operating actively in the suburbs of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Guangdong People Are Rich in Patriotic Thought; Determined Not to Be Tempted by the Enemy, Willing to Suffer Trampling; Wu Tiecheng's Remarks in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Airmail] The reporter met with Wu Tiecheng, the former chairman of Guangdong Province, in Chongqing a few days ago and had a long conversation. The reporter asked whether the various methods recently used by the Japanese army to attract residents after occupying Guangzhou City, which have included using Japanese merchant ships traveling to and from Macau without charging fares to persuade Guangzhou people seeking refuge abroad to return to the province, could be effective, given that there were few residents and the city was not easy to restore. Wu Chang replied, before the war of resistance, there were indeed 1.2 million residents in Guangzhou. After the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, the government advised the people to evacuate, and many people voluntarily went elsewhere to seek refuge. In July and August of last year, the city's population was less than 500,000. When the enemy army landed in Baiyasi Lake, the provincial government even issued orders and announcements forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate every day. By the day the enemy army entered Guangzhou, all the residents with a little property had fled, leaving behind only the poorest people. In November of last year, a survey by British, American, and French missionaries sheltering refugees in Guangzhou City found that only 50,000 people remained in Guangzhou City, of whom 17,000 had already been sheltered in safe zones and only 33,000 were displaced. Subsequently, I strictly ordered the counties close to the war zone to implement a political blockade against the enemy, prohibiting people from entering Guangzhou, and cutting off the import of all daily necessities needed by the Japanese. The enemy army is trapped by us and cannot avoid using tricks and appeasement policies to deceive us, such as not buying tickets to take boats, etc. However, the people of Guangdong are rich in patriotic thought, have a strong sense of national identity, and will never be tempted by the enemy. Moreover, the enemy army's various atrocities are appalling, and the people of Guangdong will never be willing to be trampled on. I dare to assert that the enemy army will be trapped to death in the city, and will eventually collapse after a long time. [Central News Agency]</p>
<h3>Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet to Be Replaced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Shanghai reports that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, returned to the United States last month. His successor is Rear Admiral Hart, Chairman of the US Navy's General Board. Hart is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of May or the beginning of June.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Kidnapped; Still Not Found; Reports of Escape on the Way to Tanggu Are Incorrect</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 18th Dispatch] According to the latest information, Mr. Diadia, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, who was kidnapped yesterday, has not yet been found. A previous report said that Diadia was found 12 miles from Tianjin on the way to Tanggu.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 18th Dispatch] The news that Diadia, who was kidnapped yesterday, has been freed was caused by an erroneous phone call from a sentry. The sentry said that he had seen a car carrying three Chinese and one European on the way to Tanggu and wanted to inspect it, but the driver of the car refused to stop.</p>
<h3>National General Mobilization Law Is Gradually Implemented; Japanese Merchants and Civilians Suffer More and More; Five-Year Military Expansion Plan to Begin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] Tokyo Foreign News: The Japanese government today announced the implementation of Article 19 of the National General Mobilization Law and stipulated that those who violate the article will be punished with imprisonment of up to twelve months or a fine of up to 1,000 yen. With the implementation of Article 19, Article 33 will also be implemented in conjunction. According to the original text of Article 19 of the Japanese General Mobilization Law, "When the government deems it necessary for national general mobilization in wartime, it may issue necessary orders regarding prices, transportation fees, storage fees, rental fees, and processing fees in accordance with the provisions of the Imperial Edict." Article 33 states, "When it is deemed necessary for national general mobilization, the government may, in accordance with the provisions of the order, collect reports from those who are in charge, and when necessary, conduct on-site inspections of the business status, books, documents, and other items."</p>
<h3>International Anti-Aggression League; Resolutions of the Seventh Congress; Demands That All Countries Fulfill Their League of Nations Obligations; Capacity to Cooperate and Assist China in Its War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Airmail] The International Anti-Aggression Movement held its Seventh Congress in London on February 18th and 19th. Sir Cecil, Mr. Gutteridge, and former French Prime Minister Peng Gu chaired the congress and passed a number of resolutions, including aid to China and Spain. China has now received a copy of all the resolutions, which have been translated into Chinese. The details are noted below:</p>
<p>General Resolution</p>
<p>Three years ago, when the dignity of law in Abyssinia was being undermined, the Anti-Aggression Movement came into being. Today, such acts of destruction are continuing in various places: in Austria, in Czechoslovakia, in Spain, and in China. Tomorrow, there may be more threats and acts of violence.</p>
<p>Even the Anglo-Italian Agreement and the Munich Agreement have been violated. Only by returning to the League of Nations and the principles of international law upheld by the International Anti-Aggression Movement can we avoid falling into a state of chaos again.</p>
<p>Czech Part</p>
<p>This Congress is deeply dissatisfied with the wanton acts inflicted on Czechoslovakia and the damage to democratic creeds and peaceful behavior. It declares that the political and economic independence of Czechoslovakia must be maintained and calls on all governments to provide all necessary assistance to this end.</p>
<p>Spanish part</p>
<p>This Congress reiterates its condemnation of foreign aggression against Spain and its legitimate government. It is concerned about the bankruptcy of the non-interference policy due to the failure of certain governments to fulfill their promise of non-interference. This Congress wishes to arouse the attention of all parties.</p>
<p>This Congress earnestly hopes that the terror and brutality that are destroying Spain will end, and protests against all pressure to force the legitimate government of Spain to surrender unconditionally.</p>
<p>This Congress calls on the world to oppose any recognition of a new government, in law or in fact, that violates the provisions of international law.</p>
<p>This Congress calls on countries dedicated to justice and peace to do everything in their power to seek a solution based on the following three principles:</p>
<p>1. The political and economic independence of Spain.</p>
<p>2. The immediate withdrawal of foreign troops and foreign domination from Spain.</p>
<p>3. Ensure that no Spaniard is mistreated or harassed because of the political attitude they have taken during the civil war.</p>
<p>This Congress believes that France will be able to treat the military and civilians who have sought refuge within its borders well, in accordance with its consistent noble traditions.</p>
<p>China part</p>
<p>This Congress reiterates its past resolutions, with particular attention to boycotting goods from Japanese aggressors.</p>
<p>This Congress calls on governments to implement the resolutions of the League of Nations General Assembly and the Council, which specifically propose that member states should avoid any actions that may hinder China's war of resistance and individually implement the various provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant.</p>
<p>This Congress demands that all countries ban the transportation of all arms and military supplies to Japan and jointly agree to refuse all Japanese imports. This Congress urges its national branches to redouble their efforts to ensure that governments and private organizations provide effective assistance to China, such as the recent loans to China from the United Kingdom and the United States, although they still seem to be pending.</p>
<p>Given China's courageous resistance, if the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union can work together to effectively stop Japan's aggression, while providing China with the assistance it deserves, and refusing loans to the aggressor, as well as the necessary supplies to maintain the war, then the victory against aggression is now.</p>
<p>Conference on Peace Organization</p>
<p>In order to resolve future economic and political disputes, this Congress expresses its opposition to the methods adopted in the recent past, as these methods are only sufficient to foster the principle of intimidation and violence over the law. This unfortunate method has prompted most of the world to advocate convening a conference to be attended by all countries to jointly discuss various economic and political issues.</p>
<p>This Congress warmly supports the significance of this conference and believes that the purpose and methods of this conference are extremely important and should be given special study. Therefore, this Congress will convene a special meeting of personnel to discuss it. It will be convened as soon as the Secretariat and the officers of this Congress receive the necessary documents.</p>
<p>Indian part</p>
<p>This Congress recognizes the statement of the Indian Legislative Assembly that its vote to withdraw from the League of Nations does not express hostility to the international community, but is a protest against abandoning the principles of the League of Nations. This Congress insists that only by implementing the principles of the League of Nations to ensure world peace and democracy can the League of Nations expect the support of India and other valley regions.</p>
<p>Liaison issues</p>
<p>This Congress urges the Secretariat of the General Assembly and the Secretariats of the various branches to seek closer communication between the major branches of this movement. In particular, the four branches in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the war zones should pay special attention.</p>
<p>Lectures, travel, and education work</p>
<p>This Congress urges the Secretariat of the General Assembly to organize a complete lecture tour, dispatching a large team to the Americas, as well as Scandinavia, the Baltic, and Central European countries to promote the International Anti-Aggression Movement.</p>
<p>The Congress urges the national branches to redouble their efforts to educate the public on the principles of the International Anti-Aggression Movement and the significance of upholding the dignity of the law. [Central News Agency]</p>

<h3>Veteran Yunnan General Fan Shisheng Assassinated; The Assassin Surrendered Himself to the Police Station; According to His Confession, the Motive Was to Avenge His Father; Yunnan Provincial Authorities Are Paying Close Attention</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 17th Dispatch] (Delayed) General Fan Shisheng, a famous Yunnan general, has been involved in revolutionary work for many years. Recently, due to the reorganization of the army, he relinquished his military power and returned to his hometown to practice medicine. At 4:30 PM on the 17th, he was on his way to a consultation when he was assassinated and killed. The assassins, Yang Weiqian and Yang Weixiang, were arrested on the spot. It is reported that the Yangs are the sons of Yang, the former commander of the Yunnan Army, who was killed by Fan. This act was to avenge their father. He Yingqin telegraphed Long Yun to offer condolences and inquire about the interrogation of the case.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th Dispatch] Regarding the assassination case of Fan Shisheng, it is reported that the assassin has surrendered himself to the police station and issued a written statement stating his motive for avenging his father. The police station has now transferred the assassin to the court for trial. Fan's remains were moved to his private residence on the evening of the 17th and placed in a coffin. His family has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report the circumstances of Fan's assassination and requested that the murderer be punished according to the law. Fan was 53 years old, graduated from the special class of the Yunnan General Camp School, and successively served as the battalion commander of the First Artillery Battalion of the Northern Expeditionary Army, the chief of the advisory office of the Yunnan Kaiwu General Xing Shu, the commander of the 16th Regiment of the Army Infantry, the commander of the Second Army of the Yunnan Army stationed in Guangdong, the commander of the 16th Army of the National Revolutionary Army, the commander of the Xiangfan Garrison, and the commander of the 51st Division, and a member of the National Anti-Smoking Committee. His mother is over eighty years old and still alive, and his wife is currently living in Shanghai. He left behind two daughters and one son (only four years old), and his family is very poor.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th Dispatch] The authorities here are paying close attention to the Fan case. According to reports, the assassin Yang Weiqian's father, the late military officer Yang Zhen, was once a classmate and colleague of Fan. When Yang was a regimental commander, Fan was his deputy. Until 1925, when Yang was the commander of Fan's advance detachment, stationed in Nanning, Fan and Yang lived in the same room. Yang was stabbed to death by mutinous soldiers, while Fan survived. Therefore, Yang's son suspected that his father's death was orchestrated by Fan. According to his written statement, the motive for this assassination was purely to avenge his father.</p>
<h3>From Shashi to Xiangfan</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>The car set off from Shashi at dawn when the leftover snow hadn't melted and dark clouds gathered, powerfully heading towards Xiangfan, northern Hubei. We had replenished with cheap gasoline in Shashi to cover the round trip. I heard that fruit in Xiangfan was very expensive. The Sichuan oranges that sold for fifty or sixty for a yuan in Shashi could be sold for a dime apiece there. The driver bought a lot of Sichuan oranges and stuffed them in the car, hoping to make a small fortune. However, the car was overloaded and kept "chuchu" making sounds of protest, making the passengers feel sorry for it, predicting that it would break down sooner or later.</p>
<p>After driving more than ten jia, we arrived at Jingzhou (Jiangling). The car entered from the east gate and exited from the north gate. Looking at the high, thick, and majestic city walls, the winding, green moat, and the many lively guards, it was clear that this ancient city was fully prepared to exert its glorious historical power to resist foreign aggression. The city was full of tung trees and willows, with lotus flowers and green algae everywhere; however, the corner the car passed through was desolate grassland. During the Three Kingdoms period, Guan Yu, a famous general of the Han Dynasty, guarded Jingzhou. First, he used his combat skills to subdue Wu and Wei, and then he lost the opportunity because of arrogance, which became a regret for readers of history for thousands of years. The "Guan Yu Temple" still preserves one of his relics - a belt; "Chengtian Temple" has a large pot, more than ten feet in diameter, which is said to be military supplies used by Guan Yu in those years. The abbots of the two temples vigorously promoted the divine spirits, and the incense has always been very prosperous. After the war, many people went to worship and pray. However, the city was also tragically bombed by enemy planes, resulting in more than twenty civilian casualties. This shows that ethereal divine spirits cannot provide realistic blessings against the harm of war. Our compatriots who generally believe in divine spirits should be thoroughly aware: quickly move the sincerity of respecting ghosts and gods and respecting heaven and earth to respecting the heroic soldiers fighting on the front lines! Move the money for worshipping gods, buying incense, firecrackers, and sacrifices to buying guns and bullets to fight the enemy! This is truly a realistic way to protect oneself and one's descendants!</p>
<p>We arrived at Jingmen and stopped to eat. We met Staff Officer Jiang XX from the XXX division who had just returned from the front lines. According to him, the war situation in central Hubei was briefly as follows: "The enemy in central Hubei frequently invades westward, their purpose is to expand the Pinghan defense line, consolidate the defensive strongholds in Jingshan and Bo City, and prevent our guerrillas from attacking, as well as a large-scale counterattack. However, their forces are limited. When we meet them head-on, if they do not collapse, they will be in a stalemate. In places such as Yuekou and Tianmen, the enemy and I have fought fiercely since spring, gaining and losing several times. Our army is mostly new and sharp, and every battle is extremely brave. Although sacrifices are inevitable, we can definitely prevent the enemy from advancing." Mr. Jiang can be said to have given a complete overview of the recent war situation in central Hubei.</p>
<p>After driving another twenty li, near Nanqiao, on a small slope, the car, as expected, asked for sick leave - it broke down! The driver repaired it with freezing hands in the snow and wind; after two hours of repairs, it was still unsuccessful. The passengers, unable to endure the biting cold wind for long, began to sing in unison, giving the driver some "reverse praise"!</p>
<p>At that time, twenty or thirty wounded soldiers who had just been carried from the front lines, with honorable wounds, were shivering and sleeping on stretchers made of green bamboo, hemp rope, and straw by the common people. Under the dual attack of wounds and severe cold, they were so miserable that they couldn't even groan. They shed blood for the country on the front lines like this, and after being wounded, they had to suffer from cold and hardship like this. Can we compatriots in the rear, warm and well-fed, really be indifferent?</p>
<p>Who knew that our driver, not blinded by profit, generously donated - two baskets of Sichuan oranges upon seeing the miserable situation of the wounded soldiers, and entrusted an "old villager" to carry them heavily with the stretcher team. That night, because the repair was too late, we stayed overnight in Nanqiao, but the passengers had no complaints. The public outrage that had made them want to "beat the drums and attack" the driver had already happily left with the heavily loaded Sichuan oranges, although the car's load was not excessively lightened as a result.</p>
<p>While repairing the car on the small slope, we saw many convoys training in Nanqiao Town from afar; when we entered the town at dusk to find lodging, we didn't see a single soldier. Later, we understood the mystery. If we had to say it here, there would only be four words for one night's encampment: "Advance one step."</p>
<p>The old folks in the town had already learned a lot of valuable lessons from the current realities of the enemy's actions. Chatting with them, some said to me: "This time the war is different from the previous infighting for the country. We can only win, not lose. If the ending is a defeat, it will be terrible! Our fields and houses will be permanently occupied by the Japanese enemy. But—but our equipment is a bit lacking."</p>
<p>"What's so terrible about that!" another抢着 said: "Like you gentlemen (referring to reporters), today's car broke down on the small slope. Repair it, patch it, and it will eventually climb up the slope. If you let go halfway, the car will hurt your own people. The enemy's equipment is a bit more powerful, but now if we don't risk our lives to defeat him, it will be even worse later!" There is quite a bit of the idea of "If you don't destroy the snake, what will happen when it becomes a dragon?"</p>
<p>Some told me: How good our troops are, such as paying for the grain they eat; carrying things for them and transporting the wounded soldiers. No less than five dimes a day...—These sound like everyday things, but in reality, they are great evidence of military-civilian cooperation that will surely lead to victory!</p>
<p>The next morning, we set off, passed Yicheng, stopped for a moment, and continued north, arriving in Xiangyang at four o'clock in the afternoon. The leader of the ferry across the Xiang River (i.e., the Hanshui River) to Fan said: The ferry time every day is stipulated from * o'clock in the afternoon to * o'clock in the evening; at other times, the ferry stops due to air raid prevention. Single people can use small boats to come and go. He also said; Usually, those who make a living by boating are very afraid of military service. Now he himself is requesting to serve the national crisis. The "authorities" know that he is skilled in the water and do not dislike that he is an old man in his fifties. He was also issued a full body armor and overcoat, and does the same patriotic work as the young brothers. He feels it is the most prestigious thing in his life. When the ferry sailed to the other side, and turned back, we saw large slogans written on the walls of Xiangyang City by the Korean Brave Team: "Koreans and Chinese, Unite!" It really makes people feel mentally excited.</p>

<h3>Germany's Breach of Contract - Britain and France Will Never Recognize It - Chamberlain's Speech Was Filled with Grief and Indignation - Denouncing Hitler's Inhumanity and Injustice</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The cabinet held a cabinet meeting this afternoon. Chamberlain rushed back from Birmingham to participate. The German and American ambassadors went to the Foreign Office today. Foreign Secretary Halifax paid a visit to the King at Buckingham Palace yesterday. The American Ambassador Kennedy and the opposition leader Atlee also visited the Foreign Secretary one after another.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Britain has instructed its ambassador to Germany, Henderson, to notify the German government that Britain believes Germany's actions completely violate the Munich Agreement and that the changes caused by Germany's military actions have no legal basis.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] France has instructed its ambassador to Germany to notify the German government that France does not recognize Germany's forced intervention in Czechoslovakia as legitimate. Some newspapers believe that the French ambassador to Germany will also be recalled to provide a report, just like Britain. It is generally believed that this is a very appropriate way to express disagreement with Germany's violation of promises without resorting to the extreme measure of severing diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Henderson, was ordered to return to the country from Berlin tonight to provide a report to the Prime Minister. Before leaving Berlin, the ambassador will visit the German Under-Secretary of State and is expected to depart on Saturday evening. At the same time, a Reuters interviewer learned from a senior responsible party that the government has ordered British banks to restrict the transfer of Czech deposits in London, and a statement on this matter may be issued in the House of Commons on Monday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The news that the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Henderson, is returning to London has been received with great satisfaction here. It is believed that although this move by Britain is slightly late, it has finally taken the same path as President Roosevelt's actions last November.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham today, the final section of which was received with enthusiastic cheers and applause from the audience. The section read, "I am willing to sacrifice almost anything for the sake of peace, with only one exception: the freedom that we have enjoyed for hundreds of years can never be abandoned. Although I do not want my country to be bound by unclear new obligations, it would be a supreme mistake to think that my country will not exert its full strength to resist provocation. I make this statement with the firm belief that it will not only gain the sympathy and support of the men and women of my country, but also the support of the entire empire and all peace-loving and freedom-loving nations." The Prime Minister began by saying, "The events that have taken place in Europe have relegated all other matters to a position of insignificance. I believe that what you want to hear now is the British government's feelings about the nature and meaning of these events. One thing is undoubtedly certain: the people of the world have been shocked this time as never before. Even what Germany has done in the past has never caused such a deep impression on people's hearts. Although it is impossible to predict how it will affect the future, it can be said with certainty that it will have a significant impact." The Prime Minister continued, "This Wednesday, due to a lack of information, I had to maintain an overly cautious and restrained attitude. When I thought I could only make a few comments, this calm and objective expression easily caused misunderstandings from the outside world. Some people thought that because I spoke calmly at the time, I did not feel the seriousness of the problem. I hope that tonight's speech can dispel this misunderstanding." Chamberlain went on to address outside accusations that the German occupation of Czechoslovakia was a direct result of his visit to Germany last autumn, because this event has torn up the Munich Agreement without leaving any traces, which shows that Chamberlain's previous trip was a mistake. Chamberlain argued, "Some people in the outside world think that this behavior is the Prime Minister's personal policy, so the fate of Czechoslovakia should be borne by the Prime Minister. In fact, this is not a very reasonable conclusion. My primary purpose in visiting Germany was because the situation at the time was extremely critical. The trip was the only way to avoid a European war. This primary purpose has been achieved, and European peace has been restored. If there had been no such trip, millions of families would be mourning the heroic flowers of Europe today. In fact, I don't need to defend my previous trip to Germany. I ask, if there had been no such trip, what other way could have been followed? No matter what actions we, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries took at the time, we could not have saved Czechoslovakia from aggression and destruction. Even if we finally participated in a war to punish Germany, all parties would have suffered terrible damage. Even if we won, we could not restore Czechoslovakia in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. I went to Munich to carry out the so-called European appeasement policy. If this policy had been successful, no country would have attempted to rule Europe alone, but each country could have satisfied its necessary conveniences to develop its resources and share international trade, and improve the livelihoods of its citizens." Chamberlain went on to mention Hitler's guarantee in Munich that the Sudetenland was his last territorial demand in Europe. This guarantee was later reaffirmed at the Berlin Sports Palace, "In view of Hitler's repeated guarantees, I had a hope that once the Czech problem was resolved, just like the solution in Munich, the European appeasement policy could be further promoted. Even so, I still dare not relax my vigilance until all countries also establish and accept this policy. Therefore, after the Munich Agreement, our country's national defense plan was accelerated in order to make up for the weaknesses shown during the crisis. I firmly believe that after the Munich Agreement, most people in the country share the hope I hold and earnestly hope that this policy will be further promoted. However, today, seeing this hope so completely destroyed, I also express disappointment and indignation with the people of the country. How can this event be compared with the guarantees I made to you? As a signatory to the Munich Agreement, I should be ordered to participate in the various provisions of the Munich Declaration. However, things are not like that. Hitler insisted on his own way, and even before the Czech President had obtained his irresistible demands, the German army had already mobilized. A few hours later, it had already entered the Czech capital." Chamberlain then described the position of Czechoslovakia under German rule, saying, "Who can not give heartfelt and supreme sympathy to such a heroic people, once tragically wounded, whose freedom has been reduced, and whose national independence has been destroyed? Where is the promise that there will be no more territorial ambitions? Where is the promise that 'Germany does not want to annex Czechoslovakia'? When I talked to Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Hitler insisted on national self-determination as a principle, but what will he say now? It is still difficult to believe that these repeatedly stated solemn guarantees are prone to problems. What kind of credible guarantees do we still have in this same area? The events of this week completely violate the treaties that Germany itself has made, which has made us all not know what to believe. Is this the end of an old danger, or the beginning of a new one? Is this the final attack on small countries, or will it continue to happen? And is this fact a further step in the attempt to rule the world by force? These are all extremely serious questions that I do not intend to answer tonight, and I believe that this really requires extremely serious consideration, not only by Germany's neighbors, but also by countries outside Europe. The facts show that everything has begun and there is a possibility of accelerating the promotion. We can only shift our attention to the various states of the Empire and France, which cooperates closely with us. We should review our strength in a responsible manner, because this is also extremely necessary. Our review cannot be neglected, therefore, the safety of the country is loaded, with this eye, make a detailed inspection of every department of the national lifeline." Then the Prime Minister concluded with the aforementioned remarks. Finally, Chamberlain added, "We don't have to panic and be disappointed. Our country is now a great strength and a strong country, even stronger than six months ago. Sooner or later, inhumanity, injustice and faithless atrocities will eventually eat their own fruits. All these events are enough to create a future crisis for Germany itself. I dare to predict that one day Germany will deeply regret the mistakes of its government."</p>
<p>British and American Comments</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham yesterday was unanimously praised by the British newspapers. Generally, it focused on three points: 1. They were all filled with emotion for the Prime Minister's condemnation of Hitler's breach of contract without the slightest compromise. 2. They unanimously hoped that the facts would follow the Prime Minister's words and cause Hitler to have some scruples in his future actions. 3. They believed that the Prime Minister's expression of being deceived by Hitler was indeed a fact, so the Prime Minister should not bear the sole blame for this incident. Regarding the last point, the right-wing "Daily Express" demanded that the Prime Minister resign immediately, while the Times said, "Chamberlain has the same grief and disappointment about the illegal occupation of Czechoslovakia and the destruction of international covenants by the tyrannical German army."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech last night was quite gratifying here. The New York Times said, "Chamberlain's speech was published at the same time as the statement of the US State Department, which has a very deep meaning." The "Herald Tribune" said, "The Munich policy has now come to an end, and it is replaced by a policy of expanding the army and resisting provocations."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th] The German government refused to comment on Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, only saying that the government had not yet made a meticulous study of the contents of Chamberlain's speech, so it was not yet time to express its opinions.</p>

<h3>The United States Issues an Official Statement - Condemning Germany's Illegal Acts - Roosevelt Said a New Neutrality Act Must Be Established - Large-Scale Taxation of German Goods Will Be Implemented</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] President Roosevelt said that based on the recent developments in Europe, we can see that the United States must formulate a new neutrality act. As for the drafting of the bill, it can be decided by the government holding several meetings. The President continued to refer reporters to his message to Congress on January 4th. According to the President's message, the current Neutrality Act sometimes helps the culprits who create wars. The United States can rely on methods that are more advanced than verbal protests to curb aggressive actions without resorting to war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] US Undersecretary of State Welles, with President Roosevelt's permission, issued an official statement today condemning Germany's "illegal acts," mentioning Germany's abuse of "arbitration power" to occupy Czechoslovakia, saying that "Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia is a temporary deprivation of the freedom of independent and free nations. Since the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic, the American people have maintained a particularly close and friendly relationship with it." Welles concluded by declaring, "Such illegal acts and abuse of violence endanger world peace and the institutions of modern civilization." It was also declared here that the Undersecretary of State's indictment of Germany's seizure of Czechoslovakia focused on legalistic overtones rather than diplomatic euphemisms. A spokesman close to the government said, "We don't want to hear the sophistry of aggression again. People in the world are now at least well aware of our position."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman gave a speech in the Senate today, severely attacking Germany, saying that Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia further proves Hitler's ambition to rule the land by force, thinking that wherever force can reach, he will try to occupy it. The recent trends show that Germany, Italy, and Japan are working together to achieve their goals, so Latin America is inevitably threatened. Since the situation is so serious, we should immediately prepare to take political and practical actions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Senator King gave a speech in the Senate today, saying that "the attitude of Britain and France is to condone the slaughter of Czechoslovakia." He said that he very much hoped that the United States would sever relations with all "aggressive" countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The US Treasury Department announced that the US government has cancelled the most-favored-nation treatment for Czech imports from today. In the future, large-scale taxation will be implemented on goods imported from Germany.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Jewish Telegraphic Agency said that it had notified Colonial Secretary MacDonald that the Jewish delegation had considered the British government's proposal for Palestine. The proposal was the basis for the establishment of an agreement. The Jewish delegation has decided to disband it. Reuters learned from authoritative sources that the Arab representatives at the meeting with British government representatives this afternoon opposed the principles contained in the British suggestions, that is, the Jewish people rejected the right to establish an Arab state. They also opposed an indefinite transition period, the length of which depends on the degree of cooperation between Jews and Arabs. They declared that unless these main obstacles are removed, it is useless to discuss detailed plans. They demanded that the British government immediately abandon the principle in order to peacefully resolve the Palestine issue. It is expected that the Palestinian Arab representatives will issue a statement soon.</p>
<h3>Hitler Returns Home, Issues Economic Ultimatum to Romania, Tension in Memel</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 18th] Hitler left here at 10:30 this morning, destination unknown. The people of Vienna were ordered to turn out and cheer him off. When he returns to Berlin, the people of Berlin will also be prepared for a grand welcome, it is said.</p>

We do not carry weapons in order to maintain the pure and self-loving nature of the Germans. We know that the Lithuanian government cannot fulfill our hopes, especially in economic terms, so we hope they will allow us to return to Germany."</p>

<p>Italian Newspapers Put On a Brave Face</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome] The newspaper "Il Telegrafo," a mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Ciano, published an editorial yesterday entitled "Italy's Attitude," stating that the British and French newspapers are deceiving themselves by thinking that Hitler's success is enough to weaken the relationship between the German and Italian axes. In fact, this is completely wrong. The two countries on either side of the Alps are indispensable to each other. Although Germany has realized its plans on the continent, it will never disregard Italy. In order to confront the common front of all countries in the world, Germany must unite with Italy. Therefore, the increase in Germany's power and prestige is a cause for great joy in Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] A large Japanese contingent sent a telegram to Hitler stating, "On behalf of my government, I would like to extend my congratulations to Your Excellency on this unprecedented success."</p>

Chemistry has become a major weapon in war, but Soviet Russia does not want to use this weapon against others, unless someone uses it against us first, then the responsibility cannot be borne by us."</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>×× Appeals from Various Circles in Shanghai</h3>
<p>An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 18th stated that various Shanghai organizations have jointly telegraphed Chongqing, appealing to the National Government to protest to the British, French, and American authorities regarding the deprivation of the rights of Chinese residents in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. We should express our enthusiastic support for this urgent appeal from our compatriots in Shanghai and seek its early success.</p>
<p>However, we should also pay attention to the following points: First, in addition to the Chinese people, the invasion of China by Japan has also caused very serious damage to the interests of the British, American, and French countries in the Far East. In particular, since Britain and France have implemented a policy of compromise and concession towards the German and Italian aggressors in Europe, they have further allowed Japan to seize every inch of land in the Far East and become increasingly rampant. The recent Japanese oppression of the Shanghai concessions is one of the most obvious examples of this. Therefore, we must point out that this is the result of the British and French policy of compromise. Britain and France must urgently abandon this policy in order to protect their interests in the Far East. Otherwise, any concession or compromise towards the Japanese will only serve the aggressors and result in increasing the shackles of their own suffering!</p>
<p>Second, the latest facts of the Japanese oppression of the Shanghai concession authorities depriving our compatriots of their rights are: (1) On the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, compatriots in the French Concession raised the flag at half-mast, which was interfered with; (2) The concession authorities allowed the Japanese army to search and arrest our compatriots in the International Settlement and the French Concession. Here, we should point out that (1) the concession authorities' act of depriving our compatriots of their due rights has violated the concession regulations; (2) the concession authorities are suspected of committing illegal acts of disrespect towards our country; (3) the concession authorities are suspected of protecting the illegal acts of the Japanese army in the concession.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that the recent unfortunate incidents in the Shanghai concessions of repeatedly depriving our compatriots of their rights are by no means the intention of the concession authorities, nor are they tolerated by the friendly countries of Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, on the one hand, we demand that the friendly countries of Britain, the United States, and France quickly investigate the root cause of such incidents in the Shanghai concessions and give them a severe punishment so that our compatriots residing in Shanghai can enjoy their due rights. On the other hand, we must also prevent the development of any sentiment of hostility towards any friendly country, so as not to fall into the plot of the Japanese!</p>
<p>Fourth, we hope that the government will accept the appeal of various Shanghai organizations regarding the unfortunate incidents of the Shanghai concessions oppressing our compatriots, lodge a serious protest with Britain, the United States, and France, and demand a prompt and fair resolution. At the same time, we hope that public opinion at home and abroad will pay close attention to this and do its best to arouse international righteous people to sympathize with our appeal and unanimously demand that their governments seek a thorough solution.</p>
<h3>After the Partition of Czechoslovakia, Will Germany and Hungary Reach a Compromise? (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Dong Pingduo</p>
<p>The Inside Story of Hungary's Seizure of Ruthenia</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia was divided, and Germany's swallowing was not something that a single "Munich Agreement" could stop. This is something everyone understands. However, Hungary also took advantage of the fire to rob and seize Carpathian Ruthenia—also known as Little Russia—which seems to be quite unexpected. But the occurrence of the fact is by no means accidental; everything has its background and evolution.</p>
<p>As far back as the era of Imperial Russia, all of the Ukrainian lands were under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Imperial Russia. At that time, the Ukrainians were already brewing an independence movement, which was naturally not allowed by Imperial Russia, and they often carried out large-scale arrests and exiles to Siberia. Therefore, many Ukrainian leaders fled to the Ukrainian territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where they established the "Ukrainian Information Bureau," which specialized in anti-Russian activities.</p>
<p>When Imperial Russia was overthrown and the Bolsheviks came to power, the Ukrainian independence elements believed that the opportunity had come, so they formed a "United Association to Build Ukraine and Destroy Russia." They moved into Russian-held Ukraine and established a "Central Committee" in Kiev, declaring Ukraine's independence. Their actions were supported by many anti-communist forces.</p>
<p>But, of course, the Soviet Union was unwilling to lose this fertile Ukrainian land; therefore, it launched a military counterattack, but was defeated by the invading German-Austrian Allied Forces. The German-Austrian Allied Forces thus protected Ukrainian independence, supporting Cossack General Skoropadsky as the leader.</p>
<p>When the Great War ended and Germany and Austria were defeated, Skoropadsky had to step down, and he was replaced by a figure closer to the Allied Powers, namely the devil Petliura.</p>
<p>Petliura's opening was very impressive: he issued a declaration announcing the union of Romanian-held Ukraine and Austro-Hungarian-held Ukraine; his new Ukrainian national plan included Galicia, Bukovina, Bessarabia, and Carpathia.</p>
<p>The current Ukrainians still remember Petliura's reign of terror with lingering fear. His cruelty and tyranny far exceeded that of Hitler, and he was equally obsessed with cruelty; he commanded a large army and specialized in brutalizing Jewish residents.</p>
<p>Later, Petliura was finally brought to justice, his dream of a Greater Ukraine collapsed, and he fled into exile in Paris, where he was shot and killed by a Polish-Jewish poet in 1936. The killer was called Samuel Schwarzbard, and he said in court: "My twelve close relatives all died at his hands." As a result, all of France said: "The criminal is not the killer, but the one who was killed." As a result, this hero was freed.</p>
<p>This is how Petliura died, and his dream of Ukrainian independence also died long ago. At that time, few Ukrainians still thought about independence.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union immediately seized back the old Russian-held Ukraine, and as a result of the treaty, western Ukraine was given to Poland; Bessarabia and Bukovina were given to Romania; and Carpathian Ruthenia, originally in Hungarian hands, was ceded to Czechoslovakia. In this way, Petliura's dream of a Greater Ukraine was divided among five countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Hungary.</p>
<p>In fact, if Hitler had not harbored thoughts of covetousness, the Ukrainian problem could have been considered over. But after Hitler came to power, he vigorously supported the Ukrainian independence plan, because only in that way could he obtain the rich Ukraine from the Soviet Union, and then divide Poland and conquer Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Hitler naturally still used the old Nazi methods. He found that there were still a small number of Ukrainians who were longing for the independence of their homeland. It was naturally easy to organize them into a useful gang. Thus, in Danzig, a "Central Committee for Preparing for Ukrainian Independence" was established, presided over by a Ukrainian army general named Tsylnyk, who had served in the era of Imperial Russia.</p>
<p>This "Central Committee" immediately began work, agitating the Ukrainians in Poland. At the same time, it organized Ukrainian stormtroopers, everything was modeled after Germany: however, the brown uniforms were changed to light green, and the name was changed to "Siczy Guards."</p>
<p>At first, Tsylinsky carried out this work completely secretly, because at that time, Germany and Poland still maintained friendly relations with each other. But recently, everything has been revealed. After the Munich Agreement, the Siczy Guards formally took on the police duties of Carpathian Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thus, Tsydusky moved the "Central Committee" to Hust, the capital of Carpathian Ukraine, the pillar of the Greater Ukrainian movement. Under the support of German strength and economic assistance, and in accordance with Hitler's orders, he was responsible for leading the Greater Ukrainian movement.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hitler repeated his old trick and established a Ukrainian headquarters in Berlin. He appointed a former Petliura subordinate army officer named Suzuk as the leader; he organized many assassination squads and sent them to Poland and the Soviet Union, where they carried out large-scale activities, and incidents occurred one after another. They carried the blue and yellow flag, the same as the one Tsylinsky promoted in Hust, and Tsylinsky was also actively agitating for Ukrainian demands for autonomy in Poland.</p>
<p>Poland is now fighting hard against this assassination and agitation. But the facts of Austria and the Sudetenland in the past, and Czechoslovakia and Slovakia now, cannot but chill her heart. Wherever Hitler glances at, his lackeys will not let go.</p>

<h3>In Response to the Extraordinary Period! Hong Kong Government Officially Announces Residents Service Registration Ordinance, Divided into British and Foreign Sections, Chinese Excepted, To Be Passed and Implemented at the Next Legislative Council Meeting</h3>
<p>With international winds and clouds turbulent and uncertain, a second world war could break out at any time. In order to prepare for the recruitment of people for service in extraordinary times in case of war, the Hong Kong authorities, in addition to stepping up training for the army, navy, and air force, have specially formulated the Residents Service Registration Ordinance. The full text of the ordinance was published in the Government Gazette yesterday and is divided into two parts. The Attorney General, Mr. Ainsworth, will submit it to the next meeting of the Legislative Council for approval and implementation. If anyone violates the ordinance at that time, they will be subject to criminal or monetary penalties. The draft translation of the ordinance is as follows:</p>
<p>British Residents Must Fill Out Forms Within Two Months</p>
<p>It is noted that the ordinance pays special attention to the registration of foreigners. As for British nationals, they must report in detail their qualifications and skills, as well as their desire to serve in Hong Kong or abroad during wartime. The law is divided into two parts. The former pertains to the voluntary registration of foreigners, and the latter pertains to the registration of British nationals. According to the registration method in the second part, all British nationals in Hong Kong must register, but Chinese British citizens, active-duty soldiers, women, men under the age of fifteen or over the age of fifty, and others who are exempted with the approval of the Governor are not subject to the restrictions. The registration form lists name, age, place of origin, occupation, date of arrival, and skills such as aviation, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and wireless communication, for registrants to fill out themselves. It also includes sections for dialects and commercial experience for reporting. Registrants must also specify (A) the type of service they are willing to perform in extraordinary times, or (B) the type of work they are willing to perform in Hong Kong. British nationals must fill out the form within two months after the registration law is promulgated and implemented. New arrivals must also register within two months of arriving in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>All Foreigners Must Be Strictly Registered</p>
<p>The first part pertains to the registration of foreigners. All foreigners residing in Hong Kong (Chinese are not included) must personally report orally or in writing to the police station registration office within forty-eight hours of arriving in Hong Kong. Foreigners must also report any changes to their business or residential address within one week of the change. When the police deem it necessary, they may order foreigners to clearly fill out the nature of their passports, permits, and occupations, and submit two photos of themselves for storage. Persons in charge of organizations such as hotels, clubs, and hospitals must record in detail the name, nationality, date of arrival, length of stay, and purpose of stay of any foreigners residing there. Ship owners or agents must submit a detailed report of the foreign passengers on board within forty-eight hours of the ship's arrival in Hong Kong. Foreigners who are not subject to the above restrictions are only those who have registered with the police station, or have obtained permission from the Commissioner of Police, or foreign consuls and their families, ship employees, and children under the age of sixteen. The above registration law will be approved by the Legislative Council and then promulgated and implemented.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Military Expansion Costs Reach £26,000</p>
<p>In view of the increasingly urgent international crisis, the British authorities are stepping up military expansion in order to seek peace through military strength and are actively implementing national defense construction plans. The new naval construction projects include £26,000 for projects in Hong Kong, such as £5,000 for the reclamation project, of which £4,000 will be spent this year, and £2,900 for the expansion of the electric power station, which will be spent entirely this year. £10,000 will be spent on the £21,700 new radio station construction this year, bringing the total expenditure to £16,700, and the remaining £5,000 will be allocated to next year's budget. £4,000 of the £28,000 cost of the Stonecutters Island seawall construction will be spent this year, and the military construction costs will be £6,000. The construction costs for the army in Hong Kong are as follows: Army Headquarters (total £35,000), £9,000; increase in the number of new recruit barracks for the defense forces (total £175,000), £5,000; three British army barracks (total £1.11 million), £500,000; Joint Heavy Duty Hospital (total £110,000), £30,000; Royal Flag Barracks (total £80,000), £7,000; Bowen Road Army Hospital, £5; Kowloon New Recruit Barracks, £10,000.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Annual Military Expenditure is Six Million Dollars</p>
<p>In order to enhance the British Empire's national defense strength, the British Empire has increased its huge national defense expenditures in recent years. Hong Kong's annual contribution to this expenditure is stipulated to be 20% of the total annual revenue, but starting this year, due to the sharp increase in military expenditure, this percentage-based method of paying the British Empire's defense expenditure has been abolished, and a new fixed amount of six million dollars per year has been set. This new method was approved by the central government last year and is being implemented. Hong Kong has formulated the 1939 National Defense Expenditure Bearing Ordinance to regulate this change. The ordinance also stipulates the abolition of seven articles or chapters of the draft ordinance related to national defense expenditures. It is stipulated that Hong Kong's annual contribution to national defense, six million dollars, is allocated monthly. However, if the military expenditure of the Hong Kong garrison exceeds this amount in any year, Hong Kong will not make any additional allocations. This is also stipulated. However, if the rise and fall of the Hong Kong dollar makes it inconvenient to implement this method, the ordinance will be amended immediately. This method is experimental and will last for five years.</p>
<p>Aberdeen Harbour Officially Designated as a Military Zone</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities, considering that Aberdeen (i.e., Ap Lei Chau in Hong Kong) is surrounded by mountains and water and has natural strategic advantages, deemed it suitable for the navy to establish defenses. Therefore, they issued an order a few days ago ordering all vessels moored in the area to move to the vicinity of Wong Chuk Hang. Since the fishing boats received this order, they have successively sailed into Wong Chuk Hang in recent days. According to investigations, more than one hundred vessels have already left the Aberdeen waters. Since the authorities issued this order, the nearby vessels have automatically dispersed. Yesterday, a reporter accompanied the person in charge of the Fishermen's Progressive Association to investigate, and saw that all the boat households were about to leave completely. Once all the vessels have been relocated, the authorities will immediately begin dredging the river to complete the naval defense zone in the shortest possible time. It is estimated that the area can accommodate several giant ships or warships. If the authorities deem it necessary to establish naval defenses on other sea areas, they will issue orders prohibiting vessels from mooring at any time. It is said that the authorities will select another suitable sea area as a place for vessels to moor. If they believe that the sea area cannot accommodate the vessels, the authorities will find a way to build houses on land for the Tanka people living in boats.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Forts Hold Separate Gunnery Exercises</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Artillery Department announced yesterday the dates of the gunnery exercises for each fort as follows: (1) The Pak Sha Wan Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on March 20. If it cannot be held on that day, it will be rescheduled to the 21st. The exercise range is in Zone A. (2) The Stonecutters Island West Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM daily on March 20 and 21. The exercise range is in Zone G. (3) The Pak Sha Wan Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM on March 23. The exercise range is in Zone A. (4) The Lei Yue Mun Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM on March 23. The exercise range is in Zone B. (5) The Lei Yue Mun Fort is scheduled to hold gunnery exercises from 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM on March 24. If it is not held on that day, it will be rescheduled to the 27th. The exercise range is in Zone B.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Government Has a Comprehensive Plan to Fundamentally Relieve Refugees and Actively Seek Repatriation When Possible, While Training Refugees for Work and Production</h3>
<p>Lawyer Lo Man Kam Speaks to Reporters</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of war in South China, refugees from the Hong Kong border and mainland flocked to Hong Kong. Considering the obligation to assist refugees from allied nations, the Hong Kong government has been actively considering ways to resettle these refugees. According to recent statistics, the Hong Kong government is currently accommodating over ten thousand refugees, distributed among various refugee camps in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. It is estimated that the government has been actively working on accommodating and assisting these refugees for the past five months. Concerns regarding the future resettlement of refugees are currently a focus of attention from all parties. Yesterday, reporters interviewed Chinese representative Lawyer Lo Man Kam, inquiring about this issue. Representative Lo stated that the Hong Kong government has delegated full responsibility for the management of refugees to Medical Officer Situ Wing Kwok. Therefore, he is not fully aware of the current relief plans and methods. However, according to his knowledge, the Hong Kong government has already decided on its policy regarding future resettlement and will implement it according to these steps in due course.</p>
<p>Repatriation</p>
<p>This policy is most appropriate and can be generally divided into two principles: The first is to actively seek ways to repatriate refugees to their home villages within the possible range, enabling them to continue production. The second is to plan fundamental relief measures, such as organizing work relief programs, allowing refugees who are unable to return home due to environmental factors to obtain work. The Hong Kong government believes that providing assistance to allied nations' nationals in distress is an inherent obligation. However, prolonged accommodation, unconditionally providing food, clothing, shelter, and various enjoyments, would cause the evacuees to lose their desire to return home. Prolonged residence abroad would indirectly affect the population of allied nations and weaken production. This would not only be unhelpful to allied nations but also harmful. The Hong Kong government has carefully considered this issue and decided to repatriate refugees whose home villages have been declared safe within a feasible environment.</p>
<p>Training and Production</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of fundamental relief. In addition to actively seeking to repatriate refugees, the government is also actively planning to properly resettle refugees who are unable to return home due to the occupation or destruction of their home villages. Because refugees who are idle for a long time can easily develop laziness, the government has decided to plan and train refugees in various productive skills so that they can earn a living through their abilities and strengths. This is a principle upheld by the Hong Kong government in providing refugee relief. Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote has attached great importance to providing relief to our compatriots seeking refuge in the past few months, constantly considering and consulting on appropriate methods. This extraordinary concern is truly touching, and it is believed that the above plan will achieve satisfactory results in the future.</p>
<p>Relief for the Poor</p>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the progress of providing relief to impoverished residents of Hong Kong. According to reports, the authorities are also very concerned about the poor residents of Hong Kong and have long decided on a relief plan. The construction of refugee camps in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon is one of the relief plan's components. The government's motivation to relieve the impoverished masses predates the outbreak of war, and the first phase of work has already begun. Recently, impoverished people sleeping on the streets in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon have been surveyed and registered and sent to various camps for accommodation, preparing to organize various industrial product factories in the future to accommodate these impoverished people and provide them with opportunities for production. Due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War, the government must temporarily delay fundamental poverty relief because it is dealing with refugee relief.

<h3>Young Woman in Nam Hau Village, New Territories, Severely Injured in a Midnight Attack; Husband Watching a Play When Assailant Broke In; Suspect Mr. Mok Arrested and Sent to Hospital for Identification</h3>
<p>A wooden house without a number in Nam Hau Village, Shap Pat Heung, Ping Shan, New Territories, where the victim, Mr. Leung, lived with his wife, Tam Sim (25 years old). The night before, Leung went to see a movie at the newly built cinema in Yuen Long, while Tam Sim stayed at home. Tam closed the door to sleep because it was quiet at night. Before long, a man broke into the house. Tam got out of bed and questioned him, and then saw the man holding a kitchen knife approaching menacingly. When the man saw Tam's bed, he raised the knife and threatened her. Tam retreated to the edge of the bed, and the man swung the knife and slashed, hitting her head twice. Covered in blood, Tam cried out for help, but none of the neighbors knew. After the man committed the crime, he attempted to kill Tam, swinging the knife again. Tam blocked with her hand, and her hand was also slashed. She fell to the bed, and the man fled. After Mr. Leung returned home from the play, he saw that his wife had been injured and quickly asked what had happened. Tam勉强made a few words, saying that it was done by Mr. Mok Muk-hei, a man living nearby. Leung immediately went to the police station to report the case. Police detectives rushed to the scene to investigate and, guided by Leung, arrested the suspect, Mok Muk-hei. The police detectives first sent Tam to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. After being admitted to the hospital, Tam was unable to speak due to her serious injuries. Fearing that Tam might die, the police immediately escorted the suspect Mok Muk-hei to the hospital for Tam to identify before interrogating him.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Court Judgments on Eight Criminal Cases: Chan Sek-lam Denies Attacking Lam Pak-sang; Violent Robbery of Blind Woman and Other Crimes Severely Punished; Habitual Offender Deported Nine Times Sentenced to Four Years in Prison</h3>
<p>This month's criminal cases were heard yesterday morning at 9:30 AM by Justice MacGregor of the High Court. There were a total of 21 cases, and judgments were made on only eight. The most noteworthy case was the attack on Lam Pak-sang, in which the defendant Chan Sek-lam did not hire a lawyer to defend him but still denied the charges against him: (1) Intent to murder Lam Pak-sang by injuring him on Des Voeux Road on January 17 of this year, (2) Injuring Lam Pak-sang with the intent to cripple him. The court ordered the case to be adjourned until next week for further hearing. The details of the trial of each case are listed below.</p>
<p>Violent Robbery</p>
<p>(1) Ho Pak-yau, also known as Tau Pei-yau, was charged with robbery in Kowloon on January 14 of this year. Government lawyer Abbott prosecuted. The defendant pleaded guilty. The court sentenced the defendant to five years of hard labor imprisonment. (2) Lo Fuk-lam was charged with (1) intent to rob and (2) assaulting the victim in Kowloon in December of last year. The defendant pleaded guilty to the second charge. The court sentenced him to one year of hard labor imprisonment. (3) Cheung Lan and Wong Yi, also known as Wong Kwai-po, were charged with violently robbing Liao Hing, a blind woman, of 52 Hong Kong dollars and 1 National dollar in Kowloon City on February 14. Both defendants pleaded guilty. The court said, "According to the confession recorded in the patrol court, the second defendant had more than 30 dollars in cash on her when she was arrested, and the first defendant only had a few cents. You two actually used scissors to violently rob an old, blind woman who gambled. You should be severely punished." The court sentenced each of them to three years of hard labor imprisonment.</p>
<p>Possession of Firearms</p>
<p>(4) Ho Kong was charged with possessing an unlicensed pistol and six bullets in Sham Shui Po on February 17 of this year, in violation of Hong Kong law. Government lawyer Blandice prosecuted. The defendant pleaded guilty. The court sentenced him to two and a half years of hard labor imprisonment. (5) Liao Tin and Mak Yiu were charged with possessing an unlicensed pistol, a dagger, and five bullets in Tai Kok Tsui on February 24 of this year. Prosecutor Blandice told the court that there was conclusive evidence of the second defendant Mak's guilt. The court, upon hearing this, acquitted Mak Yiu. Lawyer Blandice also told the court that the first defendant Liao Hing had been charged with two counts in 1931. After the trial, he was convicted and sentenced to six months of hard labor imprisonment for each count. In 1938, he committed theft and was sentenced to four months of hard labor imprisonment. The court, upon hearing this, sentenced him to two years of hard labor imprisonment. (6) Cheung Hing-jai was charged with possessing an unlicensed pistol and seven bullets in Yuen Long on February 22 of this year. The defendant pleaded guilty. The court asked lawyer Blandice, "Was the defendant's pistol recently used?" Blandice replied, "According to the armorer's inspection of the pistol, there were no signs that it had been fired." The court then sentenced the defendant to twelve months of hard labor imprisonment.</p>
<p>Re-entry After Deportation</p>
<p>(7) Chu Lam was charged with violating the deportation ordinance. According to government lawyer Blandice, the defendant had committed numerous crimes. Since 1923, he had committed a total of 14 crimes, nine of which violated the deportation ordinance. The defendant pleaded guilty.

<h3>Many Upsets in Yesterday's Horse Race; Yana Added Another Three Wins; Place Pool Paid Out Over a Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>Because of the heavy rain for several days last week, the turf at Happy Valley Racecourse was somewhat affected. Although it was sunny all day yesterday, the sunshine came too late. As a result, the hot horses were caught off guard in yesterday's first special horse race. Except for "King Tenth Jutton" in the third race and "Nus Earlich" in the sixth race, the rest suffered a complete rout, allowing the long shots to triumph and return victoriously. Naturally, the payouts for the single bets in each race were high. For example, the first race paid 53 dollars, and the seventh race paid 50 dollars. The others also paid more than 30 or 40 dollars. The quinella in the fifth and seventh races were major upsets, paying out 1,054 dollars per ticket. It is believed that most bettors suffered losses, but those who favored the long shots made a killing and filled their wallets. Among the jockeys, Yana once again took the lead, winning three races.</p>

<h3>Exploring the Rice Famine in Chaozhou and Shantou</h3>
<p>— Chi Cheuk</p>
<p>Profiteering Merchants and Corruption Adding Fuel to the Fire</p>
<p>The rice famine is severe, and the people's food is worrying. The Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the Sze Yup Commercial Associations have repeatedly requested the central government to exempt imported rice from taxes in order to maintain the people's livelihood. However, Generalissimo Chiang's reply was that it should not be discussed. What exactly is going on? There are, of course, reasons for this in the Party.</p>
<p>To explore the "mysterious answer," the reporter visited Mr. Lin Zifeng, a member of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, yesterday to inquire about the actual situation in Chaozhou. Although this is a very complicated issue, it is not difficult to find its clues. Although there are many different opinions, there are also common points. Here, we must report the constitutional situation obtained from the exploration to readers as follows:</p>
<p>The grain production in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas has never been enough to feed the people of Chaozhou and Shantou. In the past, the deficit mostly came from the provinces in the Yangtze River basin, with Wuhu being the largest source. Because Wuhu rice has a sticky quality that is most suitable for cooking porridge by the Chaozhou and Shantou people. In normal times before the outbreak of war, about 1.5 million bags of rice were imported into the Chaozhou-Meizhou area, each bag weighing 180 catties. At 20 Shantou dollars per bag, the Chaozhou-Meizhou area had to purchase 30 million Shantou dollars worth of rice annually to maintain the people's food supply. In the past, due to convenient transportation, regardless of whether the local harvest was good or bad, the supply of foreign rice was never interrupted. We only saw high rice prices, but we never saw a rice famine.</p>
<p>However, this situation of temporary stability came to an end after the flames of war spread and transportation was blocked. The Yuehan Railway, which transported national rice from the Hubei and Hunan provinces, was interrupted. Wuhu rice was banned from export by the Japanese. As for foreign rice, each bag cost 20 Shantou dollars, and the import tax was more than 5 National dollars, so merchants found it unprofitable and stopped doing such business. Although there were still routes to Fujian and Jiangxi, they were actually very difficult. The number of troops was also limited. As a result, demand exceeded supply in Chaozhou and Sze Yup, as well as the surrounding occupied areas. Each yuan could only buy about four catties of white rice. On average, rice prices throughout the province were twice as high as at the same time last year. As a result, people above the middle class who ate dry rice switched to porridge, and people below the middle class, especially those who barely earned enough to eat their fill every day, now had to tighten their belts and eat two fewer bowls. It has already become difficult to barely fill their stomachs with coarse grains.</p>
<p>Stabilizing rice prices and controlling spending were originally not without relief measures. Unfortunately, the local corrupt officials, bullies, and profiteering merchants colluded with each other and used grand-sounding names as a cover to openly disregard the interests of the people and only care about making profits. When it comes to Yao in Chaozhou and stabilizing prices in Shantou, the people of Chaozhou and Shantou hate those who manipulate them from behind the scenes and use public office for private gain, but they cannot report the situation to the higher authorities!</p>
<p>Recently, the old rice harvested last October has been exhausted, and the new early rice of June has not yet come on the market. During this period of scarcity, the profiteering merchants and corrupt officials who added fuel to the fire and stirred up trouble behind the scenes are as rampant as ever. Therefore, the rice famine has become even more severe. When there is nothing else that can be done, there is only one way: to ask the central government to exempt imported rice from import taxes.</p>
<p>Why doesn't the central government follow the people's wishes and show consideration for the difficult times by approving the request? Here, we cannot but remember a painful lesson:</p>
<p>In 1937 and 1938, the Chaozhou and Shantou areas also requested permission to exempt imported rice from import taxes. As a result, the people did not receive the government's grace, and the benefits of the tax exemption completely fell into the private pockets of profiteering merchants and corrupt officials. Because the tax-exempt foreign rice had a limited quantity and time, the cunning merchants exhausted their assets during the tax-exempt period, buying large quantities of foreign rice and hoarding it for sale. Although there was a lot of rice stored, the supply and demand were still uncoordinated and the prices were high. Until the tax-exempt period expired, according to his meticulous calculations, he knew that there was a certain amount of rice in the market and that sooner or later it would come to the merchants. At this time, he could raise the price as he pleased. Because a large amount of rice was stored in these rice merchants who were also "trustees." Thanks to the tax exemption on foreign rice, the only beneficiaries were the profiteering merchants, hucksters, and their protectors, the corrupt officials and bullies. The people were still helpless!</p>
<p>Therefore, the prerequisite for tax exemption on foreign rice is that there should be no time and quantity limits so that profiteering merchants cannot cause trouble. When the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce made the request, it also made this point clear. It is precisely because of this point that the central government is not willing to agree hastily. Because although there is actually no foreign rice tax that can be collected, once foreign rice is imported, 30 million yuan of funds will flow out annually in Chaozhou and Shantou alone. This affects the balance of foreign exchange. Regarding this point, the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce also understands the central authorities' concern for the overall financial situation during the war. It is just a question of how to purchase and transport national rice from neighboring provinces? The Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce is now resubmitting a request for instructions. In fact, the inland transportation now is also controlled by those with strong power, and there are奸men using the transportation of rice to fill their pockets. Therefore, in the final analysis, it is still a matter of "people," a matter of politics.</p>
<p>How will the rice famine be solved? Whether it is exempting foreign rice from taxes, developing transportation, reclaiming wasteland, forcing winter cultivation, or improving production methods, everything should have "good people" standing on a position of public loyalty and selflessness, doing it earnestly, only then can there be a solution. By earnestly doing it, the unreasonable organization, the deformed reality, and the profiteering corruption will have no way to use their tricks, and the people can also exert their strength to help the government build the country. Therefore, in the final analysis, this is a matter of "people," a matter of politics not being on the right track.</p>

<h3>Movie Criticism ABC</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wei</p>
<p>When talking about movie criticism, we quickly think about how movie criticism should be produced. It seems that a lot has been said about this in theory. However, because theory is still theory—there is still some distance from reality—the foundation of correct movie criticism may have been laid, but correct movie criticism has not been widely developed. This makes us realize that simply talking about theory is not enough. In Hong Kong, which has been ridiculed as a "cultural desert," to make it bloom with brilliant flowers of movie criticism, it seems that we should start with cultivating seeds—the so-called "enlightenment" work. Therefore, without presuming my own insignificance, I write down some ABCs based on what I can think of at the moment:</p>
<p>Three Basic Points:</p>
<p>(1) Self-Cultivation: It seems that every moviegoer is qualified to criticize movies—no matter how limited their knowledge or how distorted their views are, they have the freedom to blurt out whatever they want. However, to "put it into writing" and spread one's views to a wide audience, influencing society's visual and auditory senses, one must make a serious self-examination before doing this work.</p>
<p>We know that movies are complex and comprehensive art. Their object is the entire human society and the entire universe of nature. The breadth of their contact is unmatched by any other narrower art field. Therefore, to be a sound movie critic, the most important prerequisite is to have good cultivation in various fields of knowledge—this may be too demanding, but at least one should have some understanding of various fields of knowledge—especially regarding art principles, social sciences, aesthetics, etc. Otherwise, one is not qualified to write a pertinent movie review.</p>
<p>(2) Basic Movie Knowledge: The various advanced principles of film may be a matter for experts, but a movie critic must know the most basic common sense about film. We often see so-called movie criticisms that are "completely irrelevant." Not only do they fail to help the audience gain a deeper understanding, but they also fail to "convince" filmmakers to make further improvements. This is a terrible waste of the movie cultural movement. We cannot use the cliché that "one does not need to know how to lay an egg to eat it" as a shield. It is not necessary to demand that you lay eggs yourself, but you must know how they are produced. Otherwise, how can you find its flaws and then criticize it?</p>
<p>(3) Correct Understanding: A filmmaker without a correct worldview and outlook on life will inevitably fail to produce good works; a movie critic without a correct worldview and outlook on life will similarly fail to write good articles. If the critic and the maker are both confused, then the harm caused by combining two muddled accounts is immeasurable. Otherwise, if the criticism has a correct understanding, it will inevitably expose the flaws of the maker and stop its harm. If the maker is not confused either, then the advantages can be promoted and its impact expanded. Therefore, for a movie critic, the need for correct ideas is—almost more urgent than for the maker.</p>
<p>At the same time, whether this is correct can also be used to determine whether one has a calm mind. Usually, every movie critic is often swayed by a temporary "prejudice" and has their own independent judgment shaken, or is dazzled by some kind of "greatness" and does not know where to start. These are all problems of insufficient subjective concepts and an insufficiently calm mind. Its influence often distorts the facts, and this is something that those engaged in movie criticism should overcome with reason.</p>
<p>How to Criticize?</p>
<p>It is really inappropriate to use a general, superficial way of writing to develop our criticism of a good or bad movie. We must know what makes a movie good and what makes it bad. Each part that constitutes this movie, whether it is meritorious or flawed, has its own responsibility. Therefore, to really talk about movie criticism, one must apply an anatomy—disassemble it and analyze it part by part. Otherwise, one will never get the true value of the criticism.</p>
<p>For the sake of "drawing the outline to highlight the details," I will briefly list some items and look forward to brilliant supplements:</p>
<p>(1) Central Idea: From the perspective of "film for film's sake," talking specifically about film, this issue should not be listed at the beginning. However, now that movies have been regarded as a tool for mass education, under the general principle that "the evaluation of all art is determined by its social function," whether the central idea is sound has become a major premise for whether each movie has its value of existence, and this is an undeniable fact. This is a major advancement in modern art criticism, and it is also a point that every movie critic should grasp.</p>
<p>(2) Handling of the Theme: Whether it is drama or film, every work must have a theme. If the theme is not handled well, or is obscure and unclear, it will greatly diminish the achievement of the work. It is even more ridiculous to have no theme or not know what a theme is. However, in fact, we are seeing many things that do not know what they are talking about. This is the immaturity of the maker, and critics should point out this error and urge the maker to strengthen their understanding of the theme.</p>
<p>(3) Performance Effect: Whether a work can be welcomed by the masses depends mainly on whether its performance effect is good. Sometimes, a very distorted fact can also deceive the masses and make them "satisfied," and this is the reason. The definition of this issue is very broad. It is a sum and also a melody. If the manipulation is wrong, sometimes what should be strengthened is ignored, and what should be ignored is emphasized, thus creating an unintended negative effect. In these places, the critic should point it out with a calm and precise eye.</p>
<p>(4) Script: In every movie production, people only see "stars"—ignoring the screenwriter behind the scenes, and even the director. This is the bad result of the "superficial art" of capitalism, which is very undesirable. New critics should note that not only can the director determine the life of a play, but the soundness of the script also has an indivisible importance to the achievement of the entire play, so as not to commit the mistake of "abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial."</p>
<p>(5) Director: Undoubtedly, for a serious work, its success or failure is the responsibility of the director because they have the power to make decisions on everything. The "stars" that people see are only responsible to the director for what they should be responsible for in the production process. However, people ignore the director. The reason for this is that many directors—especially in Hong Kong—instead ask "big stars" to direct us, and in fact, they may only be slightly more important than the stagehands in the studio. This is a strange phenomenon. In addition to pointing out the merits and demerits that the director should be responsible for under normal circumstances, we should also urge people to know the importance of the director—there will never be a good production without a good director, and urge every director to take on the responsibility that they cannot shirk for their own "position."</p>
<p>(6) Actors: There are definitely no omnipotent actors in the world, but in China, especially Hong Kong, many are proud of being omnipotent. Therefore, what actors play themselves, in addition to representing themselves, is unimaginable in terms of artistic evaluation. Their understanding of art is mostly so superficial, and their cultivation of acting skills is naturally even more out of the question, and the so-called "personality" is also unknown. How can it not be "like climbing a tree to catch a fish" to ask them to be "competent" and "act well"? Therefore, the critic should point out their mistakes and the path they should take based on correct views, so that they have self-awareness and engage in genuine artistic efforts!</p>
<p>Other things such as the "scenery"—at least whether it is the kind that Chinese people—can live in; whether the "costumes" are too exaggerated—such as the most recent period dramas, which are only a display of color—or too simple; whether the "lighting" is a necessary match of strength and weakness and whether it is suitable for what is needed; whether the placement of "props" hinders the atmosphere of the entire play; whether the "scenes" are properly distributed in the entire script; and so on are closely related to the formation of a good or bad movie and cannot be ignored. However, due to the limited space here and the urgency of the deadline, I can only end it in a hurry. I hope to talk about it again if I have the opportunity in the future.</p>
<h3>Starting from the Children's Drama Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>Inspiration for the Joint Performance of the Hong Kong Children's Troupe on Children's Day</p>
<p>"Save the children!"</p>
<p>This great and urgent cry was shouted until ten years after Mr. Lu Xun's death before he passed away. It was shouted from before the War of Resistance to the War of Resistance. However, this urgent cry has only become more and more widespread and serious!</p>
<p>We have to say that children growing up in China with a bad social system have many unfortunate lives. There is no good construction in terms of education and entertainment. They are asked to memorize old antiques from hundreds of years ago, or live the life of street children wandering in garbage dumps. Adults must not ignore this contradictory and tragic phenomenon!</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, cruelly trampled under the iron hooves of the aggressors, tens of thousands of children who lost their lovely hometowns, fields, and kind parents, siblings embarked on a long and miserable journey of wandering and fleeing. The continuation of life is of course serious, but how to make them grow up in the War of Resistance, how to make them healthy and strong in the gunfire, the question of education is equally serious and urgent!</p>
<p>In this way, we think of the Children's Troupe, which is now affiliated with the Political Department. How surprising and admirable is it that these refugees who grew up in the gunfire have traveled thousands of miles with courage and perseverance?</p>
<p>Others, such as the Henan Children's Salvation Troupe, which fought hard behind the enemy's lines, and the Xiamen Children's Troupe, which has been struggling in various places overseas after arriving in Hong Kong not long ago, as well as the Guangzhou Children's Troupe, which embarked on a journey of escape during the fall of Guangzhou and is now working in Guangxi, all give us a special feeling of emotion.</p>
<p>In this emotion, a small amount of the current plan for children's education in the War of Resistance is displayed. Of course, we cannot completely use drama to solve this serious problem, but we clearly know that drama can achieve certain effects under the requirements of correct education and entertainment in combination with the work of resisting the War of Resistance and saving the country.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's "Lost Lamb" only gives us a vivid and profound exposure and a hint of the seriousness of the problem, but until now we have not been able to obtain a correct solution or provision. The rising children's drama should have a major responsibility. In today's wartime, the presentation of this issue is not superfluous.</p>
<p>In China, there is no famous Central Children's Theater or Moscow Children's Theater like in the progressive Soviet Union, and there is no famous talented children's playwright Ms. Sazhi. In the past, there were only poor "Poor Qiu Miao" and "Dreaming of Wonderland" and other songs and dances or divine birthday dramas. It was not until after September 18th that we treasured the emergence of Xu Xingzhi's "Last Lesson" and "Bell Sound of the Ancient Temple" and other more dramatic and complete children's scripts. At the same time, China's emerging children's drama movement had the embryonic form of budding.</p>
<p>All artistic progress is growing in the great War of Resistance. Children's drama is also being established under the guise of the flourishing development of drama during the War of Resistance. Various children's troupes have been established one after another, and they have gone to villages, hospitals, military camps, trenches, and other corners one after another. This proves that children's drama also has major functions and powers in wartime.</p>
<p>This also strongly expresses that drama endows children with correct education and good spiritual food, and inspires the purest wisdom and strength of children, so that they can grow up healthily under the enemy's invasion.</p>
<p>All cultural work in Hong Kong is progressing slowly, and the development of drama after the War of Resistance can be regarded as a sharp spearhead. Until recently, the progress of drama seems to be rushing forward with a striking posture. However, the children's drama movement has never been noticed and cultivated!</p>
<p>Very commonly in Hong Kong's school entertainment meetings, we still see performances of "Drizzle" or "Grape Fairy"-style or non-donkey-non-horse-style Western children's songs and dance dramas. It is certainly due to the environment, and it is undeniable that the correct essence of children's drama itself has not been understood, and the work of engaging in the drama movement has not been properly established.</p>
<p>However, in fact, the emergence of children's drama has already begun to sprout in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In terms of organization and work performance, we first point out the "Ant Children's Troupe." This organization has been established for more than a year and has performed "The Last Lesson," "Helping Our Guerrilla Team," and "The Story of Blood," etc., and has automatically organized a street children's school to educate a group of out-of-school street children. This spirit of learning is very admirable.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of new friends who love drama work have also organized a "Pioneer Children's Troupe," which has performed "Three Patriotic Brothers" and "The Last Lesson," etc., and is also working hard. Others, such as the School Relief Society, the Ding Twenty Troupe, and the Youth Tongle Society, have children's troupe organizations and have successively performed children's dramas.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that the Hong Kong children's drama movement has begun to grow anew, and this growth will make it bloom with beautiful and bright flowers—</p>
<p>The Four-Four Children's Day is approaching. In order to strengthen the development of the children's drama movement in Hong Kong and expand the new impact of Children's Day, this large group of young pioneers convened a joint meeting and decided to jointly perform a four-act long drama ("Long Live Children," collectively created by the Ant Troupe) during the Four-Four Children's Day to build a monument to the connection of Hong Kong children's drama. Recently, they have begun to prepare enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The children's drama movement has begun a strong struggle in the motherland. In Hong Kong, this special environment, it is urgent to establish the foundation of the children's drama movement with the latest attitude. Therefore, we warmly pray for this joint performance on Children's Day!</p>
<p>Theater Movement Trends</p>
<h3>Huanghuagang is in Intensive Rehearsal</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong drama groups have decided to jointly perform the great national defense mass drama "Huanghuagang" by more than 40 Hong Kong drama groups on March 29th in order to strengthen the united front of the drama community and work together, and to commemorate the great national holidays. After several meetings, all work has been arranged separately. At the same time, it was also decided to cooperate with the Joint Association of All Circles in Hong Kong to Relieve Refugees in South China, and all the income from the performance will be sent to the association to relieve refugees. In addition to publicity, it also bears the work of raising funds, which has dual significance. "Huanghuagang," this script was collectively created by 22 people from the Guangdong Drama Association, Xia Yan, Hu Chunbing, Luo Haisha, Zhou Gangming, Lou Zhaojie, Ruan Qi, Cai Biqing, etc. before the Huanghua Festival performance in Guangzhou last year. Now, due to the change of time and environment, some of the lines are not very suitable. Therefore, Mr. Hu Chunbing was publicly recommended to revise it. He has completed the revision yesterday and sent it to Gui for printing. It is expected to be printed and sent to Hong Kong in the next few days. Now, they have begun to rehearse intensively under the leadership of the five directors of the directing team based on the revised draft. After the New Year's Day, we can see this unprecedented great performance.</p>
<h3>Salvation Performing Arts Team Comes to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>We have published the news that the Shanghai Salvation Performing Arts Second Team will come to Hong Kong from Gui to prepare for overseas propaganda in the previous two issues. Originally, they were scheduled to leave Gui on the 10th of last month and were expected to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of last month or the beginning of this month. However, there is still no trace of them, and friends in Hong Kong's cultural and drama circles are very concerned. I have just received an airmail letter from Jinshan, the head of the delegation, sent from Gui this month, and learned that the departure has been delayed because the travel expenses and the purchase of foreign exchange have not been resolved. Now that all the problems have been solved, it has been decided to go to Haiphong from Guilin on the 10th of this month and transfer to a boat to Hong Kong. This time, they will stay in Hong Kong for 40 days to handle the formalities for going abroad and purchase all items. During their stay in Hong Kong, they plan to give two or three performances. In addition, they also plan to exchange opinions with friends in Hong Kong's cultural and drama circles, and hold an exhibition of war trophies to exhibit the war trophies obtained by the delegation during their years of working with the army on the front line in Central China. It is estimated that the journey from Guilin to Haiphong will take a week if the transportation is convenient. The voyage from Haiphong to Hong Kong will take three or four days. It will probably not take more than a few days to arrive in Hong Kong! However, due to the inconvenience of wartime transportation, if there are no cars and ships from Guilin to Haiphong now, then the journey will be delayed for many days! Hong Kong's cultural and drama circles are now preparing to hold a welcome ceremony for the delegation's arrival.</p>
<h3>The Reorganized China Travel Troupe</h3>
<p>The China Travel Troupe is still under the leadership of Mr. Tang Huaiqiu after the "separation" and the "reconstruction." It has accepted the past experience and lessons and taken on the mission of the drama movement again. Now, they have reorganized their troops, refreshed their lineup, and started intensive rehearsals of new plays to prepare for performances. At the same time, their troupe site has also been moved from the noisy and bustling fourth floor of the United Restaurant to a quiet and secluded place—11 Phoenix Terrace, Wanchai. The lineup is also quite strong compared to before, with 33 new and old troupe members, both men and women. "China Travel" pillar Tang Ruoqing returned to Hong Kong from Gui at the beginning of the month. Tang Ruoying, Peng Guohua, Zhang Ying Huanghe and others are also very capable young drama people. There are a total of 25 to 30 plays to be performed. At present, they have started rehearsing 7 plays in preparation for the first performance, including You Jing's new work "A Tear on the Clothes" and "Phoenix City," "Motherland," "Frontier Storm," "Wilderness," "The Beginning of Man," and "Our Hometown," which were introduced in the ninth issue of this magazine. They will officially perform next month, performing in Mandarin and Cantonese respectively. I hope they will work hard and not live up to the past glory! (Note: For more details about China Travel, please refer to the "China Travel in Reconstruction" in the next issue of this magazine.)</p>
<h3>Movies and Women</h3>
<p>— Jie Li</p>
<p>On this vast stage of the world, men and women are originally an indispensable pair of roles. In human life, the adjustment of both sexes is indispensable. That is to say, women are indispensable. If there is no participation of women, it is simply not drama art. If we want to find a few movies without women in the world, it is really not an easy thing.</p>
<p>Women are becoming indispensable in movies. In China, where the male-centered tendency in society is still very obvious and very blatant, the proportion of women in movies is greatly enhanced, especially in Hong Kong, which is the capital of China's film industry. The social environment is so full of pink colors, and alcohol and pornography have become indispensable stimulants for ordinary young masters and comprador rich men. Women in movies have generally become the most noticeable things for those movie audiences. Therefore, the position of women in movies is very considerable. It is unimaginable for a movie to have no women. We have only seen films that exaggerate the number, beauty, or sexiness of women, and have never seen a film that cannot find a single woman in the entire film.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, this special place, in a society where the male-centered tendency is very strong, the increasingly delicate and valued depiction of women in movies, and even the fact that movies have become centered on women, all this is not enough to indicate the strengthening of women's status in a male-centered society, but rather illustrates that ordinary movie audiences, in the constant tempering and dyeing of alcohol and pornography and the environment, have constantly shifted their attention to the description of women in movies. Thus, we can see many movies on the market that are centered on women, capturing a large audience.</p>
<p>The fact that movies are centered on women and focus on the fine depiction of women cannot be regarded as a downward trend in movies. The question is, what is the position, direction, and technique of movies in depicting women, and what kind of women do they depict? At present, the general depiction of women in movies is only following the social taste and engaging in low-level expressions. Their position is standing in the male-centered position and having another view of women. And the so-called direction and technique are really pitiful, and they are all vulgar and weak. Therefore, the women they express are all superficial and untrue. Their purpose is actually just to attract a large audience through the depiction of women.</p>
<p>In fact, the description of women in movies should start from a deep point of view, from the special environment of society, to discover the typical of contemporary women in the current environment.</p>
<h3>Speaking on Stage Techniques</h3>
<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>5. The Art of the Actor</p>
<p>A. The Easiest and Most Difficult Art Simultaneously.</p>
<p>Tyrone Guthrie said, "If people ask what is the easiest art? I will answer, the art of the actor. If they ask what is the most difficult art? I will also answer, the art of the actor."</p>
<p>Precisely because the actor's art of performance is merely the act of a person playing a person, which is inherently not a difficult thing, some people doubt its value as an art. Gordon Craig said, "I never believed acting is an art. A leaping lamb and a nightingale in the forest, the former seems to dance, the latter seems to sing, can you say they are artists?" However, this argument is unsound. The performance of a play is not everyday reality. The lamb's leap and the nightingale's song are merely an instinct of life, and their leaping and singing are also expressions of everyday emotions. But the actor's performance on stage is not their own everyday life; it is something produced through artistic creation. This thing, in other words, the emotions created through artistic means, is enough to "infect" others and evoke resonance. Therefore, the value of performing arts exists.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason why performing arts are a "difficult" art is that it is simultaneously pretending and creating. A novelist spends a considerable amount of time in the writing process to complete a novel. When they read it carefully again, if they find inappropriate rhetoric, they can modify it, and modify it again – until it is perfect before releasing it to the public. But the actor's performance lacks this superior condition. Their work is simultaneously creating while it is being produced. The process of creation is also the completion of creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is impossible to say whether the art of the actor is easy or difficult, but upon closer reflection, it is considerably difficult.</p>
<p>B. The Creation of Realism.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the actor's art of performance is the creation of a sense of realism, and the most important thing is to ensure that the audience always believes without realizing it.</p>
<p>The creation of a sense of realism, in other words, is created through certain production methods. Then, this is already a "non-realistic sense of realism" but is merely a created thing. For the method of creating this thing, the actor first creates a "hypothesis" in their own mind, a created "imagined reality." Stanislavski said in his famous book "My Life in Art": "Only when the actor's soul and imagination display fantastic, creative 'hypotheses' can there be creativity. If there is only true reality, only actual truth that people naturally cannot help but believe, then creativity has not yet begun. When a creative hypothesis appears, that is, when the actor faithfully and with the greatest enthusiasm believes in this 'imagined reality' – even more than believing in true reality – then the actor will step from true reality into another life, that is, when they believe in the 'hypothesis' imaginatively created by themselves, only then can the actor begin to create."</p>
<p>Therefore, the development of imagination and illusion is the keynote of the creation of performing arts, but this kind of inspiration cannot be forcibly completed using artificial methods. Stanislavski said, "I am not trying to create inspiration artificially; that is impossible. What I require is to create a good quality (referring to the actor themselves) that can use willpower to express inspiration." "To express inspiration by willpower" is the golden rule of performing arts! We know that the actor's performance is not everyday reality; it is merely the creation of a sense of realism. However, human inspiration, or rather, the emotional effect of human beings, is a definite and inevitable physiological reaction. Feeling a certain stimulus causes a certain degree of reaction. This is the phenomenon of human reality. However, as just mentioned, the actor's performance is not everyday reality. On the stage, the actor does not feel a certain stimulus as in everyday life, but they must show an emotion that reacts to a certain degree, as if they were stimulated. It cannot be too much, nor too little; it must be just right. Otherwise, it will lose the sense of realism, and the audience will realize they are acting. To achieve this, the actor must first train themselves to become a "good quality," able to command and control themselves, expressing good feelings by willpower, and be able to freely use their own body – internal, self-control of the nervous system; external, manipulation of physical movements. The actor must be able to control their attention, to become the master of all their expressions and actions. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>International Football Semi-Final: China vs. England, Who Will Win the Championship? Today at 4 PM at Caroline Hill</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] In last year's football competition, our Chinese team won five titles, except for the English Sunday Cup of the International Tournament, which was taken by foreigners. The grand aspiration of sweeping all the championships was ultimately not fulfilled. This year, our Chinese team has a tendency to sweep the titles again, but looking ahead, there are still many obstacles. All our athletes must work harder from now on to succeed.</p>
<p>Taking today's international semi-final at Caroline Hill at 4 PM as an example, if the Chinese team wins and eliminates the English team, it will only win the right to the final. The issue of winning the championship is still not up for discussion. If they unfortunately lose, all hopes will be lost, which will not help in the future. Therefore, they must overcome today's difficulties, and then further compete with the Portuguese team for the championship on April 10.</p>
<p>Comparing the talents of the Chinese and English teams, there is a clear difference in level. On the English team's side, the same-nationality sailors-turned-players are performing drills in Singapore and could not help. The selection problem had to be solved second best, so four players from the second team were selected, making the team's strength slightly insufficient. However, with the support of Middlesbrough's three midfielders in the middle, and the participation of famous players such as Parker, Erridge-Duran, and Morris and Healy, the momentum is still not weak and should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The Chinese team has Li Huitang leading the forward line, whose prestige is enough to overwhelm people. The other players are also top choices. Hou Chengtou was injured yesterday and it is not known whether he will participate in the battle today. If he is absent, he will be replaced by the reserve Huang Jingcong. Huang is agile and will be able to fulfill the task happily. Song Lingsheng's foot injury has fully recovered. If he cannot force himself to appear, Zeng Zhongyun will be the most appropriate replacement. The starting lineups for the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>[Great China Team]</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng (Eastern Football Club)  Hou Chengtou (Eastern Football Club)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South China FC)  Li Zhaorong (South China FC)</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan (South China FC)  Liang Rongzhao (South China FC)  Li Huitang (South China Club Captain)</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua Club)  Feng Jingxiang (South China FC)</p>
<p>Song Lingsheng (Eastern Football Club)  Deng Guangrong (South China FC)</p>
<p>Reserves: Li Deqi, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan (Eastern Football Club), Zhuo Shijin,</p>
<p>Huang Jingcong (Guanghua Club)  Yang Shuiyi (South China Club)</p>
<p>[England Team]</p>
<p>Jenkins (Middlesbrough)  Feeley (Ordnance Corps)</p>
<p>Parker (Police FC)</p>
<p>Healy (Kowloon Club)  Beatty (Middlesbrough)  Erridge-Duran (Hong Kong Club (Captain))  Charterly (Artillery Corps)</p>
<p>Coburn (Artillery Corps)  Fitzwater (Middlesbrough)  Morris (Police FC)  Umbers (Artillery Corps)</p>
<p>Reserves: Lee Si (Artillery Corps)  Hanneyville (Navy Team)  Harman, Zeng Ningshi (Middlesbrough)</p>
<p>The Chinese team is so strong, it should be bound to win. The five forwards have the greatest power. However, I worry that during the battle, these five will be unable to work together. If they have an opportunity and cross the opponent's midfielder, they can move forward unimpeded. The English team's two inside forwards, although Parker has rich experience, is slow in action. He is used to charging forward, but now he is transferred to the rear to confront the Chinese team's five tigers, leading to hasty disarray, with a sigh of being unable to cope with the difficulty. Although Coburn is selected from the second team because of his skills, he is now shouldering a heavy responsibility to defend against the fierce attacks of the Chinese forward. I am afraid his strength is not enough. Therefore, the Chinese team's forwards should be careful when advancing and consider how to bypass the opponent's forward line. Although it is getting closer to their final defense, it is still necessary to avoid the solid and attack the weak for better results. I think it is easier to attack from the side than from the center because this avoids the restraint of the center midfielder. If they always break through from the center, it will easily be seen through.</p>
<p>More than half of the English team's forwards are soldiers and are not much of a threat. However, one point is that the soldiers from the second team who are shouldering important responsibilities will do their best and be cautious, and strive to do their best. However, their self-confidence is very weak. If their performance is not good from the beginning to the end, they will be psychologically affected, and even become afraid. Therefore, we should watch how they perform today and see if their first move is appropriate.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Chinese team is very confident of winning this game. However, more than half of the English team are soldiers, they will fight to the end, and this competition adopts the ten-minute and nine-minute system, the more they fight, the more advantages they have. Therefore, even though the Chinese team is more skilled, it is still not enough to hold on to. The use of strength is also an important condition. Moreover, for a strenuous sport like football, if you want to have a good performance of skills, you must have the support of strength.</p>
<p>There are a few more points that I advise fans to keep in mind. Today at 2 PM, two types of tickets will be opened, priced at five corners and three corners. However, viewers should not buy tickets outside the venue, and children should not be brought in. Those without tickets will not be allowed to enter. Once the tickets are sold out, the gates will be closed, and those who arrive late will not be able to enter. Therefore, I hope fans will arrive early to avoid disappointment (the football field is too small).</p>
<h3>South China FC Defeated Kowloon Club with a Clean Sheet</h3>
<p>Shuiyi, Genbao, and Dehui Each Scored One Goal</p>
<p>Yesterday, South China FC played against Kowloon Club at Caroline Hill. The victory or defeat of the two teams was not very important. There were few spectators. Tan Jun'gan did not play, and Deng Xihong was the goalkeeper. The rest were as shown in the table. Healy of Kowloon Club's performance was very organized, so the Kowloon Club's goal was unusually deserted in the first half. Unexpectedly, in the last 15 minutes of the second half, South China scored three consecutive goals, sealing the victory. The lineups for the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>(South China FC)</p>
<p>Deng Xi</p>
<p>Liu Mao, Guo Bingzhong</p>
<p>Liu Weipei, Lin Depu, Liang Bo</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong, Ou Shie, Chen Dehui, Yang Genbao, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>[Kowloon Club]</p>
<p>Healy</p>
<p>Wu Lie, Yi Hua</p>
<p>Zhi, Ni, Shi, Li, Li Mai</p>
<p>Bo Liaoyachen, Lu Zhaozhi, Shi Peier, Vivi Di, Lu Xiaonuo Shi</p>
<p>At the time, Bell first passed the ball to attack, but was blocked by Liu Mao. Bingzhong had not practiced for a long time and occasionally made mistakes. Fortunately, Liu Mao helped and did not cause any mistakes. South China counterattacked but failed to score. The two sides went back and forth until near the end of the game. Ou Shie received a wonderful ball and shot fiercely at the goal. Unfortunately, the ball was slightly high and missed the winning opportunity. The first half was 0-0, with no victory or defeat.</p>
<p>In the second half, Kowloon Club attacked fiercely, and South China's defense suddenly became chaotic. Xie Jinhong handled the ball with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was taken by Zhaozhi. The shot was too strong, and the ball hit the net. Twenty minutes later, Ou Shie passed the ball far to Xie Jinhong at the door. Yang Shuiyi waited in front of the door and headed the ball into the net, opening the scoring. Soon after, Chen Dehui led the army to advance fiercely. When he got close, he passed the ball to Yang Genbao, who shot with a big foot and scored. Xie Jinhong passed the ball into the center. Chen Dehui raised his foot and scored the first goal. The two sides attacked and defended for a long time and did not score again. South China FC won by a large margin of 3-0.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Annual Track and Field Event Held Yesterday, Yang Xuhua Won First Place in the 10,000-Meter Race</h3>
<p>The 24th Annual Sports Meet of the Hong Kong School Entrance Examination Association was held at the school's sports ground on Pokfulam Road at 1:30 PM yesterday. Hundreds of students and people from all walks of life attended the event, and the atmosphere was very lively. After the competition, Mrs. Luo Wenjin presided over the award ceremony, which did not end until around 7 PM. The order of the sports events held yesterday included more than 20 events. Among the various competitions, the most intense and fierce competitions were the All Hong Kong Secondary School and Open Student Mile events. The secondary schools participating in the relay race included La Salle, Lingnan, Queen's College, St. Joseph's, Yingren, and Yingshi. Eight people participated in the open half-mile. Among the other better achievements, the 10,000-meter long-distance race stood out. The first place was Yang Xuhua. Mr. Yang is well-trained in long-distance races and has participated in this competition for many years. He finally showed his talent for the first time, making a name for himself. It was not a fluke. There were also many other beautiful performances, and the viewers were very interested. The whole venue cheered. The individual champion was Jie Min, the runner-up was Lin Yucheng, the dormitory champion was Molli Hall, and the third place was Yilu Hall and De Mara Hall.</p>
<h3>Eastern FC Defeated the Navy 1-0 in a Difficult Battle; Liu Xianhan Defended Alone, Repelling Thousands of Troops</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Eastern played against the Navy in a Group A football league match at the Navy Ground in Causeway Bay. Many of the Navy's former mainstays have gone to sea with their ships, forcing them to use new forces. However, the overall combat power of the team is still very strong and retains its original style (fierce and fast). The midfield line was not disbanded due to Dixon's absence, and the skills of transportation and interception were fully revealed. For 70 minutes, the Navy's midfielders and forwards were in an advantageous position for 60 minutes. If their two forwards were as good as Philips, Armstrong, and Condie, they would not have lost 0-1.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Navy's two forwards were restrained by Zeng Zhongyun and Miao Huaguo, losing their ability to support each other. However, each of the midfielders lofted high balls to allow the forwards to charge, and Tuoban and others used their height and long legs to head off several dangerous balls, causing Eastern to panic. If it were not for the strong defense and narrow escape, the score of Eastern's defeat would have been beyond our expectations.</p>
<p>Zhongyun wore new football shoes and was very excited. He did not make a mistake once in 70 minutes. It can be said that this was Zhongyun's best performance in his life. Miao Huaguo and Xu Jingcheng also gave very brave performances. The short-legged tiger Liu Shizan happened to meet the giant Tuoban. One tall and one short, they entangled each other all day long. Although the short-legged tiger was strenuous, the giant also felt a headache.</p>
<p>Eastern's forwards had many injured soldiers. Song Lingsheng had ankle pain, Hou Chengtou had foot injuries, and they lost their mobility. Wu Qixiang made many mistakes, Li Deqi was scattered and incompetent, only Chen Bingtu made amazing progress, breaking through many barriers, which was the source of the victory. Eastern's victory regained a lot of reputation. It is also gratifying that South China FC, who lost to the police on the same day, relied on Eastern to snatch two points from the Navy, so that their highest position was not shaken, and the hope of winning the championship was still higher than everything else. Therefore, Eastern indirectly benefited South China, and its contribution was even greater than South China's victory over the Navy last week.</p>
<p>(Eastern FC)</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shizan</p>
<p>Hou Chengtou, Song Lingsheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>(Navy Team)</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>(One Minute) As soon as the whistle sounded, the contact began. Eastern showed great power and won the treasure. Just as Li Si sent it up, Bingtu ran madly to attack. J. Hanneyville could not stop him. Bingtu crossed the ball at the baseline, and Chengliu lurked at the corner of the goal and headed it in, opening the scoring (1-0).</p>
<p>(Thirteen Minutes) Linbashi cut diagonally into the center, Newlands rushed forward to head the ball, Xianhan caught it quickly, and avoided a mishap. In an instant, Tuoban made a cold shot, Xianhan panicked and撲ed, the ball rolled in front of the goal, and Zhongyun rescued it quickly before Newlands rushed to the front.</p>
<p>(Fifteen Minutes) Jingcheng lofted the ball, and Gorutas rushed out to catch it. Unexpectedly, the target was inaccurate and walked past the landing point. When he turned back, the ball was in front of the goal. Gorutas quickly turned back and passed the ball, and only conceded a corner kick, which was fortunate.</p>
<p>(Thirty-Two Minutes) Allison got the pass from Hanneyville and had a chance to pass the ball into the center. Newlands headed the ball but did not hit it. The left winger Linbashi dribbled forward and shot again, but it was ineffective.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>(Seven Minutes) McGilista got the support from the midfielder and shot from 30 yards away. Xianhan's line of sight was blocked by his teammates, and he almost made a mistake.</p>
<p>(Fifteen Minutes) Shizan fought with Tuoban and mistakenly committed a handball. Healy took the free kick, and the Navy's forwards poured into Eastern's goal. Tuoban greeted the ball and headed it fiercely. Xianhan patted it out, Linbashi intercepted it and shot it out, and Xianhan caught it with all his might and sent it out with one foot.</p>
<p>(Twenty-Three Minutes) Linbashi headed the ball in front of the goal, Xianhan deflected it out of bounds, and only conceded a corner kick.</p>
<p>(Thirty Minutes) Lingsheng got the ball and attacked. The Navy's guards intercepted each other. During the entanglement, Lingsheng's two shorts suddenly split with a loud sound, exposing his flesh. At this time, Eastern's defense was tight. Lingsheng had to cover his bare flesh with his hands and walked off the field to change into new pants before returning to defense. At this time, the Navy was still attacking fiercely and besieged for a long time but could not win, so they lost 0-1.</p>
<h3>Victory Followed by Defeat: South China Neglects Opponent, Loses; 4-3 Warning; Even Victory is Worth Boasting</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this station) Generally, people all hope that South China and Police will meet again in the championship match held at the boundary field. The victory or defeat of this police team will significantly affect the overall situation. If South China can remain undefeated after this, then this year's championship will undoubtedly belong to them. However, if they lose one game, the situation will change again, indirectly giving the Seamen a chance to compete. (Fortunately, the Seamen also lost yesterday, otherwise South China's hopes of winning the championship would be slim). Therefore, many fans went to the scene to watch the game, but unexpectedly, the South China team relapsed into their old habits. The generals underestimated the enemy, causing many mistakes. As a result, they suffered a disastrous defeat with a score of 4-3 after initially leading. The fans came full of excitement but left disappointed. South China's lack of ambition is indeed a disappointment to the general fans' expectations.</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, South China faced Police with a complete lineup and should have been more than capable of handling them. However, they failed to win when they should have. The main reasons for their failure were the generals' underestimation of the enemy and poor teamwork. Guo Yingqi had already performed abnormally, and then Zhang Rongcai in the defense was also unreliable. Logically, the generals should have worked hard, secured multiple victories, and laid a solid foundation. However, each member took the enemy lightly. Initially, they used short, dense passes, not understanding that the field was narrow and short, and that short-pass tactics were not suitable. Passing around in circles wasted time and caused Fei De to lose the ball. Then, they were too hasty and abandoned their original battle strategy. Feng Jingxiang, who took the final penalty kick, also shot with excessive force due to his eagerness to draw, and was saved by Mai Hedi. This last chance was also missed. From this reporter's observation, Jingxiang was skilled at taking penalty kicks, but his shooting power was no longer as strong as before, making it easier for the goalkeeper to save. In the future, if South China encounters such a good opportunity, Deng Guangsen should be given a chance to try. Police's performance was mediocre, but the entire team was brave and had plenty of energy in yesterday's battle. The forwards Lai Motu's sprints and Hua Liya's passes created scoring opportunities. The three forwards in the defense were more solid than the two defenders. Mai Hedi's performance was acceptable. The person who gave the best impression to our Chinese fans throughout the match was the Chinese player who played for Police. Their performance had no rude actions and had the demeanor of a great general. Police's final comeback victory was also due to the contributions of Huang and Fan.</p>
<p>Police</p>
<p>Mai Hedi</p>
<p>Chen Guangyu, Bu Likeban</p>
<p>Pa Jia, Bi Liedun, Na Fu</p>
<p>Mo Shi, Hua Li, Yuan Guicai, Qu Chen, Huang Wengui</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai</p>
<p>Luo Douwen, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>With a whistle, the two armies began to fight, like a tug-of-war. At this time, thousands of fans were surprised and delighted to see this situation. After a long battle, Feng suddenly snatched the ball, and immediately passed it to Lao Luo, who got A Dou. He flew along the side and reached the key place, then crossed. At that time, Zhaorong happened to stand in the key place without surveillance. Seeing the ball flying over, he aimed at the target and shot it into the net. After winning, South China continued to besiege. Li and Feng repeatedly shot at the door, but the ball fell wild, so it did not bear fruit. The police also counterattacked. Mo Shi and Wengui attacked along the side one after another. Guicai tried to respond twice, but the situation was quite urgent at the time. Fortunately, Tiansheng was well suppressed and kicked to save the day. At this time, South China escaped a disaster and came to attack again. Yingqi passed to Li in the key place, and Li wrote casually and shot into the net. The police lost again and again, unwilling to do so. So launched a large-scale counterattack. The ball was led by Hualiya, Rongzhao and Shaohan both intercepted. After slight evasion, he shot far to the door. The ball was as fast as an arrow, and Rongcai was so shocked that the ball slipped into the net from the corner. Before long, the first half ended.</p>
<p>In the second half, South China pressed again to Huacha's position. Feng and Li rushed into the key place to knock on the door one after another for no less than five or six times. Then Guangsen brought the ball to the center again. Yingqi rushed to the door to respond. Nafu jumped up and topped it. Unexpectedly, in a panic, the ball slipped into the door. Although Mai Hedi wanted to save it, it was too late. Police lost again, and tried their best to counterattack. Finally, with the short pass of Qu Shide and Wengui, they grabbed back a ball. And Guicai also got the chance to shoot and scored another one, competing to a tie. Finally, Moshide got a wonderful pass from the side, and Guicai used his head to top another ball. South China rose up to pursue after winning first and then losing, and the battle was chaotic. Wang He Nafu rushed to save, and the twelve-yard free kick with his hand and kiss the ball was placed in front of the door and kicked by Jingxiang. How could the magic leg be eager for peace, distracted, miscontrolled, swept too right, and had no strength, so it was saved by Mai Hedi. South China only had a chance to survive, but it was also missed, and there was no way to recover. As a result, he returned with a 4-3 loss. (Solid Book</p>

<h3>Men's Basketball Tournament: Eastern Club Wins Big; Three More Matches Today</h3>
<p>The open men's basketball tournament had three games held last night at 6:30 PM in the youth basketball gym. In the first game, Group B International beat Taikoo with a score of 54-35. In the second game, Group A Eastern played South China. Under the contact between the two sides, the competition was very fierce. The two teams were more eager to win, and their actions gradually went out of bounds. This was the only flaw. After the outbreak of the war, Eastern took the lead, and South China was not to be outdone. In the first half, the two sides tied at 21-21. When they changed places to fight again, Eastern tried to take the offensive, and South China tried their best to wait for each other. At the end of the game, South China was defeated by 35-54. The last game Huaxiong won South China with a score of 41-25. The Group A battle continued as follows:</p>

The Group A game should be very interesting. Judging from the strength of the two teams, Hong Kong University has strong combat power with Yang Xuhua, Qin Jingrong, Zhang Shaomian, and Lei Wei Lian and other players. Guangda, such as Liang Jie, Zheng Yutang, Lu Dong, Liang Jiangqiang, and Yu Bingheng are also experienced fighters. However, Hong Kong University has a stronger offensive power and should be able to win. In Group B, Red Star vs. Chenguang, the two teams have equal strength and the outcome is unpredictable.

<h3>International Film Industry Dynamics</h3>
<p>(1) Mussolini founded the "Film Village" in the former Italian capital, specializing in producing films promoting the dynamics of the Italian dictatorship. Last year, the project produced 184 films, which were shipped abroad for screening. Only 18 of them were screened in the United States, 44 in the United Kingdom, and the most, of course, were in his comrades - Germany, reaching 72. The rest were banned.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese actress Uemura Musume, who has been with Paramount Pictures in the United States for seven or eight years, was recently fired by the company. The reason for this is that after the Sino-Japanese War, her productions suffered a sharp drop in box office revenue, which dissatisfied the company's authorities and led to this move. According to the exclusion of foreign actors in Hollywood, it is still unheard of.</p>
<p>(3) Since the completion of the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan, its film industry has also made rapid progress. It is currently producing more than 40,000 reels of newsreels to be sent to the 1939 New York World's Fair. These short films will allow foreign audiences to understand the Soviet Union's overview and its national strength.</p>
<p>(4) There will be a major change in the British film industry. A business group called Philip Joint Enterprise Company is preparing to acquire 600 to 700 cinemas across the UK. At the same time, an Odeon company is also preparing to acquire 300 cinemas belonging to the Gaomeng Film Company. According to general speculation, behind this organization, there must be some Jewish millionaires who fled from Germany to support it, so there is such a huge capital.</p>
<p>(5) There are many overseas Chinese in the Dutch territory, so domestic films originally occupied a considerable force there. After the outbreak of the war, the Cantonese films monopolized the entire market invisibly, which reduced the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in their belief in the motherland. Therefore, everyone is eager for Shanghai's Mandarin films to be shipped there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(6) China's famous humor writer Lin Yutang has been engaged in writing and screenwriting in the United States, which has been popular for a while and is very popular among foreigners. Recently, he also wrote a new script for child star Shirley Temple, entitled "Little Craftsman", which will start shooting soon. According to the Chinese people who write scripts in Hollywood, this is the arrow.</p>
<p>(7) Hollywood producers have recently been trying their best to make films about the war to cater to the psychology of people all over the world.</p>
<p>(8) The anti-fascist activities in Hollywood, USA, also have a clear performance and strong force. According to statistics, 15,000 film industry employees have joined the Anti-Fascist Committee (including the famous "Earth" star Paul Muni, Louise Rainer, etc.), and the calls for assistance to China and Spain have shocked the entire silver capital.</p>
<h3>The Economic Situation of Movie Stars with Strong Exterior but Weak Interior</h3>
<p>Some people say, "Artists are mostly romantic, their purpose is entirely in aesthetics and expression, and their desire is only to obtain a pleasant state. If there is something stored in their hearts, they must express it, so money is scattered as soon as it is obtained, and they have no time to take care of the future. As a result, old age is difficult and they die in poverty." This statement, of course, has sufficient reasons. It can be seen that American movie stars, although their weekly salary income is mostly around 10,000 gold, still have to borrow money to live on, which is nothing more than spending as much as possible and being extremely extravagant. As for whether the facts are completely true, only you can come to complain.</p>
<p>In the past year or two, debt lawsuits have often occurred in the American film industry. Several popular stars have now been heard of bankruptcy, which has attracted a lot of attention from people in society, who have expressed great surprise, thinking that the income of stars is more than other occupations. Where did the money they earned go? Even the judges who interrogated the stars' bankruptcies often raised this question. According to general stars, "Although our starring in a film has a weekly salary specified in the contract, after several layers of exploitation, and then deducting all expenses, the actual amount obtained is very small. No one believes this, and in order to make a living, we still have to make a star appearance and spend money like mud. We have no savings on weekdays, and once our work is interrupted, the original shape will be revealed."</p>
<p>In the past, all film companies signed contracts with Ming Ping directly. Later, because the stars often relied on their status and were not subject to jurisdiction, the major film companies jointly formed an actor introduction office, with self-operated newspapers and magazines, used by contemporary stars for publicity. Since they have the power of public opinion, the stars dare not but listen to their orders, and it is much easier to be convinced in the event of an incident. As a rule, a 10% introduction fee is charged for signing contracts introduced by them, so the salary of the stars is invisibly discounted by 9%.</p>
<p>Taking a weekly salary of 10,000 yuan as an example, a 90% discount should also have 9,000 yuan. In the eyes of ordinary people, it is more than enough to maintain personal life. Unfortunately, the environment is a luxurious place, and it is impossible to be frugal. Anyone who can star in a film must already have a considerable status in the film industry. For the sake of one's own identity, one cannot show a poor appearance to anyone. Speaking of living, a small house in Hollywood costs 750 yuan to 2,000 yuan per month, and a slightly more gorgeous one costs more than 5,000 yuan. In addition, the cost of internal furnishings accounts for about 20% of the star's monthly income. There are also self-built houses, and the construction cost is easily 60,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan. The only way to obtain this huge amount of money is to borrow money from the bank, and the monthly interest will also cost a lot. In terms of transportation, it is really not enough to have only one or two cars. Whenever a car company produces a new car, it always has to find a way to wind it. Some even have to prepare a plane. As for the servants, each has their own expertise, which is the custom in Hollywood. Each person's monthly salary is always between 200 yuan and 400 yuan. In addition, hiring a secretary costs about one month's salary a year. In order to connect with all parties, a dance party once a week must be held. Often the cost of wine and feasts in one night is tens of thousands of dollars. At the end of the month, a huge fee must be written out to subsidize the film reporters stationed in Hollywood in order to show mercy under the pen. Otherwise, the loss of personal reputation is a big deal, and the job is a big deal, so how can it not be? The stars' clothes seem to be very broad, but who knows that they are all prepared for acting. They have to buy costumes at a high price according to the identity of the characters in the play. After a film is over, they work too hard and should take a short trip to recuperate. However, the salary has long been spent. I have to borrow money. If I unfortunately fall into the web of love, then the date of bankruptcy is not far away. What's more, you have to pay huge income taxes. However, people who do good deeds in society only see their income and do not see their expenses. As soon as there is a good deed, they all feel that the stars are the most generous. Who knows that the stars' donations are taken out with gritted teeth?</p>
<h3>Silver Flower</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Heidi Lamore threatens Garbo quite seriously, and even Garbo herself can't help but feel a little uneasy. However, there is one thing that is absolutely not in the biography of the mysterious woman, but Heidi Ramore has, that is, likes to make friends. Heidi Lamore loves to make friends, and often goes to dance halls and theaters. Most movie stars refuse to send photos and autographs to people, but she is willing to. She also gladly agrees to fans' requests to communicate and make friends with her. Don't worry, Garbo, no matter what, the title of this mysterious woman is still yours.</p>
<p>The famous critic Matilda Trotter said that under the silver screen, Jack O'Keefe is the only one of the countless male stars in Hollywood who has the most sex appeal. This made Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, and Robert Taylor look at each other, while Jack Kerr said triumphantly, "Matilda Trotter is really the best critic in the world."</p>

<h3>Two Kinds of Peace</h3>
<p>— Boshan</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, when Premier Sun was dying, he intermittently issued a weak cry: "Peace, struggle, save China!"</p>
<p>Fourteen years later, when China launched a great national struggle, shameless traitors stuttered and said: "Peace, struggle, save China."</p>
<p>The former's peace is the peace of struggle. The peace that saves China: the latter's peace, however, is the peace of kneeling compromise, the peace of destroying China. The former is based on patriotism, while the latter is based on a Konoe declaration. The biggest difference is that one is a conscious and spontaneous national awakening, and the other is a traitor who has sold his soul, echoing the harsh demands of the invaders who are trying to destroy our country and exterminate our race. From this, we can see the difference in personality and understanding between the Premier and the traitors. Sincerity and hypocrisy, greatness and shamelessness, the Premier clearly showed us, "To achieve this goal, we must awaken the people and unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally. Struggle together." That is to say, to complete the great mission of the National Revolution, we must awaken the people internally and unite the whole country, and then seek sympathy from the world, and help us and treat us equally. Unite the national and ethnic groups, and struggle together to resist aggression and strive for the ideal of lasting world peace and the rule of great harmony.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the great and heroic anti-Japanese and anti-fascist war began, we not only gave the aggressors a painful blow with a fearless revolutionary spirit, but also followed the Premier's legacy to unite all parties and factions in the country into an inseparable unified front. At the same time, we closely liaised with countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union that were fair and just and helped us, and cut off ties with the fascist bandit countries that were accomplices of the Japanese Kou, so as not to be exploited. This is what the Premier's legacy implies to us, the attitude we should take in this unprecedented environment.</p>
<p>But what about our traitors who talk about peace? They are deeply afraid that China will win and real peace will come. So first, they oppose cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and split national unity; second, they advocate taking the German-Italian route, neglect the friendly assistance of other democratic countries, and reject the moral assistance of the Soviet Union; third, they slander guerrilla warfare and scorched earth policy, and even advocate immediately giving up the war and accepting Konoe's peace demands to realize the so-called peace of the East Asian New Order. This is the traitor's planned means of betraying the country and the nation, and this is the peace proposition that the traitor loudly proclaims.</p>
<h3>Culture and Martial Arts</h3>
<p>— Xing Zaitian</p>
<p>Because the Soviet Union is Japan's deadly enemy, the traitors raised by the Japanese are also particularly jealous of Soviet Russia. However, both the master and the traitor have one thing in common, that is, they avoid the Soviet Union and conspire against China and the Chinese people.</p>
<p>For example, in the Northeast and in the occupied areas, the Japanese killed Chinese people by putting a "communist" hat on them. The master's style is like this, and the Han Yu cannot be an exception. They always echoed and shouted indiscriminately. For example, recently several cultural people went to Xinjiang one after another, so this has also become the material for the dogs to bark indiscriminately, saying: "Recently, a group of cultural people who are attached to the Communist Party are singing about going to Xinjiang again - the more generous ones do not hesitate to take the royalties they get from their brains, and buy expensive air tickets, and travel by wind, how enviable!"</p>
<p>In fact, whether those cultural people who went to Xinjiang are attached to the Communist Party, we don't know, but what is commendable is that they use what they have earned from their own labor to supply themselves with airplanes, and "do not hesitate to take the royalties they get from their brains" to buy air tickets, which is even higher than fleeing the country in a stolen plane. And biting those treacherous people who get "gold tickets" from their masters and bark like dogs every day is even more noble. Of course, people who take airplanes to Xinjiang are "enviable people", but treacherous people are hated by people, and it is not an exaggeration to "eat their flesh and sleep on their skin", which is the public opinion of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>For three months, a certain newspaper has never told the truth. Only on that day did they tell the truth. We can also borrow it to admonish treacherous people.</p>
<p>"After all, the cultural level of the southeastern Jiangsu and Zhejiang and southwestern Guangdong provinces is higher, and they opened up earlier. The general public has the intelligence to judge a new problem or a new event. No matter how propagandists propagate or tell lies, it is not easy to be effective for a while."</p>
<p>This is very true, so I often see a certain newspaper being smeared with a ball of ink and written with the four characters "Traitor's Dog Shit" in the reading rooms of several schools, which shows that propaganda and lying are really useless. Not only can it not be effective, but it is even more dangerous, and it is related to life. Therefore, the people not only have a high level of "culture", but also a not weak level of "martial arts" to eliminate traitors and exterminate criminals!</p>
<h3>Record of Mr. Chen Yinke</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>Before the ancient city fell, in the secluded paths of Tsinghua Garden in the western suburbs, one could often encounter a weak-looking scholar with disheveled hair, a weary spirit, wearing a long gown, Chinese trousers, and Chinese-style cloth shoes, walking unsteadily. He would carry a large bundle of books under his left arm, appearing burdened and in pain from the weight. This frail scholar was none other than Mr. Chen Yinke, renowned in scholarly circles and famous overseas.</p>
<p>Meeting Mr. Chen, one might not immediately recognize his extraordinary knowledge. However, if you engaged in conversation with him, his gentle yet captivating words would undoubtedly leave you completely humbled and in awe. But you must not judge him solely by his unkempt appearance and assume he is merely a bookworm. Confucius himself erred in judging Ziyu by appearances, let alone us ordinary mortals with limited insight.</p>
<p>Those who studied under Mr. Chen almost all knew his quirks. Firstly, he disliked idle chatter. If you visited Mr. Chen and engaged in pointless conversation, he would simply close his mouth first, then close his eyes, waiting for you to take your leave. He detested meaningless talk. Secondly, he needed to rest and sleep at one o'clock every afternoon. This is the reason for his "weary spirit" mentioned earlier. Mr. Chen's health was poor, and he required ample rest, which was the price he paid for his vast knowledge. If a visitor was unaware of this, Mr. Chen would bluntly tell them, "Excuse me, I need to sleep!" However, Mr. Chen's third quirk was his love of reading. During the day, he rarely put down a book, always reading. Surprisingly, he was not an old-fashioned bookworm but a highly scientific and innovative thinker with a practical research spirit. I recall once when Mr. Chen was teaching "Research on the History of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," discussing Liu Tui's "Collected Works," he focused on the preface's line, "Wild water enters the treasury..." He concluded that it referred to the flooding in Hunan province in August and even produced newspapers from the past three years to prove the reality of these annual floods.</p>

<h3>Feelings of the Night</h3>
<p>— Dong Hao</p>
<p>Climbing over mountains, galloping across plains, crossing icy rivers, passing through dark forests, carrying a heavy burden, walking on narrow and uneven riverbanks. I lowered my head, letting the cold wind sweep through my tangled hair. The water lightly lapped against the stony beach, like the whispers of ghosts.</p>
<p>Crows circled above the pine forest, their cawing echoing in the air. One, two... the distant silhouettes of sails finally disappeared completely into the darkness: the sparse branches, stripped of their leaves, became a pitch-black mass.</p>
<p>A dusky veil draped over the river's surface. The earth sank into deep slumber once more. Blackness embraced the mountains and rivers, the riverbanks, and the water's surface. The cold wind, like a wounded wild ox, whirled and howled in the sky, as if disturbing their slumber. The distant barking of dogs in the village was tight, striking into our hearts.</p>
<p>Ahead was a small river, lying quietly here, like a small wooden plank laid across, this was the bridge.</p>
<p>To the right was the vast river, the inky sky. From the thickets on the left came the sharp sound of the wind, the withered grass on the desolate and decaying tombs rustling in the gale... all of this painted a night sky brewing a storm. I stood upright by the bridge, gazing into the distance, like a sentinel on the frontier.</p>
<p>Finally, my heart began to beat faster. My legs began to tremble. Then, unconsciously, I sat down, slumped, afraid, like a weary wild beast.</p>
<p>The gale lifted my long coat, cold streams stabbing into my chest. I hurriedly pressed the bundle beneath me. The dogs barked louder and more tightly, the wind howling more mournfully.</p>
<p>"Last night, cold stars filled the night sky; moonlight shone, bringing quiet slumber to the earth. But tonight, dark clouds completely cover the horizon. This terrible night!"</p>
<p>Low chants drifted across the night's wilderness. Whose children were these, voicing their cries under the pressure of suffering? Drifting, drifting toward the horizon, finally swallowed by the gale.</p>
<p>However, what followed was a great roar:</p>
<p>"We need light, we need a clear sky! Let the darkness die quickly, advance boldly! Like a brave warrior, seek the clarity after the storm!"</p>
<p>Between the mountains, in the thickets, in the cracks of the stony beach, the roar echoed in every corner. Like a great bell, like a lion's roar. No matter how the gale howled, it could not drown it out.</p>
<p>I suddenly stood up, as if waking from a nightmare, my heart stirring. Was it God's guidance, or the nightingale's song, telling me of a smooth path? I steadied my feet, suppressed the surging of my heart, picked up the bundle, and hunched over, with light, joyful, and brave steps, walked across the bridge.</p>
<p>The night road unfolded before me. I moved forward without hesitation, a lighthouse of light erected in my heart.</p>
<p>The wind became even fiercer, but soon calmed down. In the verdant pine forest, the sound of the wind still whispered, the clouds in the sky flying.</p>
<p>The moon had already revealed its face. The dense clouds still wanted to struggle. Intense light and the clouds were constantly battling. On the illuminated riverbank, I stepped on the shadows of the tree branches on the ground, watching the dark clouds gradually disappear.</p>
<p>Countless stars shone upon the thickets, the desolate tombs, the riverbanks, and the water's surface, a scene of light! I cheered, I prostrated myself, facing the starry sky.</p>
<h3>He Resolves to Be a Marksman!</h3>
<p>— Hu Kao</p>
<p>On the flat beach</p>
<p>The sound of a great storm rises</p>
<p>Bringing the mixed smells of blood and gunpowder</p>
<p>Covering</p>
<p>Villages</p>
<p>Farmsteads</p>
<p>Valleys</p>
<p>——Every piece of soil.</p>
<p>No longer the Peach Blossom Spring of our dreams</p>
<p>This subtropical lush orchard</p>
<p>In the distance</p>
<p>Cattle and sheep in the grazing field</p>
<p>Like countless stars of summer nights</p>
<p>At the seashore</p>
<p>When the sun is about to return</p>
<p>Those dreamy, long coconut trees!</p>
<p>Now</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of gunpowder smoke</p>
<p>Like paper money turned to flying ash.</p>
<p>Hainan</p>
<p>Has my sincere friend</p>
<p>He told me not to worry about his safety</p>
<p>In the guerrilla ranks</p>
<p>He resolves to be a marksman</p>
<p>This must be forged into the tungsten steel-like strength and tenacity</p>
<p>Although our tenacity</p>
<p>Is currently not enough to stop the × people from advancing</p>
<p>But "death" cannot shift his will</p>
<p>The rushing "blood flow"</p>
<p>Is precisely the cultivation of the new China.</p>
<h3>Snow of Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>And when her gaze met his and formed a straight line, she felt his eyes flashing with the electric fire of a demon, and her eyes were blinded, instinctively covering her face with both hands. She cried out in alarm.</p>
<p>This cry aroused in him a ruthless violence, as if he had truly become a hideous demon, regretting leaving the greatest evil in this universe; even if he foresaw that tomorrow he would inevitably repent, or others would punish him: however, he would never escape, or abandon this task of a sinner today. He wanted to shoot; his reason prevented him:</p>
<p>"Your pistol is not to harm her!"</p>
<p>So, he could only open his eyes wide, clench his lips tightly, and pull out his pistol from his pocket, threatening her not to make a sound, he...</p>
<p>"When you make a sound, you must be careful..."</p>
<p>But she cried instinctively, crying out loud. This cry was the resistance of the weak.</p>
<p>For his own safety and the success of his work, he had to gag her throat with a handkerchief, making her hoarse; as if letting the maid who replaced her and lived a little longer make up for her shortcomings. He also said:</p>
<p>"When you quit, you must be careful of your life!"</p>
<p>Then, his words, for her, were the most authoritative command.</p>
<p>She obeyed and followed, with only tears, and no cries. The soles of her feet had a uniform elasticity; making her whole body tremble. A weakling, when her life loses its master, her flesh and bones are softened, allowing only a wisp of breath, in panting, to prolong her vitality. She was like a fledgling swallow left behind in a flock of swallows, losing direction in the vast sky, flying blankly towards an unknowable distance, although it had already foreseen that its future destination was an unfortunate nest; however, it could only entrust everything to fate. When a person lets fate decide, it is like a boat that has lost its rudder at sea, letting the wind and waves lead it wherever they please; it is like an ownerless wild grave in the suburbs, never inherited and guarded by anyone, allowing anyone to destroy it. She obediently changed her shoes and put on her clothes. However, she deliberately fastened her buttons slowly, hoping to prolong the time with the buttons, so that she could linger for a moment longer in this bedroom that she had grown tired of in the past; in the meantime, perhaps a rescuing hand would break through the wall and drag her away, drag her to a place of happiness. Illusion, who says it is not beautiful? But, who says fantasy can be beautiful for long? So she only deepened her original pain. (Eleven)</p>
