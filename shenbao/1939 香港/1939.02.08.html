<h3 id="c1">日軍反戰的認識 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>據重慶五日中央社電，最近×軍三千餘在大沽譁變，分析其原因可得兩端：其一，日本一般十兵皆無意於作戰，大都希望早日囘歸故里；其二，日本軍官銜好戰軍部之意旨，巧用騙術以達調遣之目的，因而激起公憤。據該電訊，還有一點值得注意的，就是駐守人沽的日本今軍竟會誤認「海軍有意與陸軍尋釁，開砲向敵艦轟擊……」，殊屬有趣，可見日軍內部之糾紛與紊亂。我們對於日軍反戰這一重大事件，須有深切之認識，其於抗戰策略之决定有莫大裨助。茲分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）日軍反戰是日本人民反戰運動之高度的發展。自從日本帝國主義開始侵略外國以來，日本人民卽有反戰的事實存在，所不同者只在其論據或出於道德觀或出於利益觀而已。在日俄戰爭當時，卽有幸德秋水等人發動反戰運動，九一八事變以來，不但日本一般民衆厭戰與反戰，卽出征士兵也都不斷地發生譁變及反戰企圖。東北曾有一個日本士兵偷將槍械，子彈及糧食輸送給我抗日義勇軍，傳為世界的美談。一二八當時上海日軍也有反戰俱樂部的組織，其普遍發展的意義，更值得深刻注意。自一般情形看來，日本反戰先自一般人民開始，所以這次對華侵略戰爭爆發不久，日本全國卽大興政治獄，只最初半年中，全國的大輪舉達三四次之多，被捕人數總計在數千以上。最初的形態是較公開的反戰煽動，但是不久卽遭法西政府的高壓而潛流化，於是由理論而到了行動。但是反戰最有力量的一環要推士兵之反戰。日×侵華戰爭擴久不能結束，士兵離鄕久則戀家，且士兵大多是貧苦工農充當的，家無恆產，難免以妻子生活為念，致使一般日本士兵思鄉心切，日本軍中竟有「不死不傷，永難返鄕」的歌謠傳誦，其危機所在，可想而知。士兵厭戰與反戰，甚而至於參加我們的抗戰，則日×的慘敗期就要到來了。</p>
<p>（二）日本民衆反戰的必然性，是我們應加確切認識的。今日侵略中國的不是全部的日本人，而只是日本統治者，特別是軍×。日本人民所得到的只是苦痛，犧牲，和加重的壓迫罷了。日本有個世界語者公開地承認：「……這次戰爭，日本人民所得到的除掉災禍，就沒有別的什麽。……所以大多數日本人民不會支持戰爭，……我經常聽到，卽連無智的農民，他們也都在咒罵這一次的戰爭」（據上田四郎「粉碎日本軍部的欺騙罷！」）。一般進步的有覺悞的日本人，大多明瞭侵略戰爭不能解除他們的痛苦，只有增加他們所受的壓迫而已。日本統治者，特別是軍部常常欺騙日本人民說：「征服」了中國，人民生活就可舒適些，但是日本人民的答復却是：「甲午戰爭及日俄戰爭的時候，那一次不是以同樣說敎說給人民聽過？到現在為止，日本雖然沒有打過敗仗，但在每一次戰事後，他們始終沒有想把國民生活改善過，相反地，只是資本家的財產越來越增加，軍×的專橫越來越增强。……」（據「停止侵華的戰爭罷！」）這雖是寥寥數語，但已道盡了日本侵略戰爭與人民利益相反的事實。歷史的敎訓比什麽都有力量，所以日本有覺悟的人民幾乎一致地主張：「中國民族和日本民衆並無絲毫仇敵的狀態，×××××××××××××××××××」。日本人民卽自其自已利害出發，他們也要反對這樣「毫無理由的」，「於他們有害無益的」侵略戰爭。</p>
<p>（三）對於日本人民反戰運動，我們雖然認淸了必然性，並且看到了多少的現實性，但是我們還要加速這個趨向，使必然性變為現實性，使部分的現實性更加擴大普遍化。這要靠我們主觀的努力。其具體的辦法約有幾端：（A）擴大對×的宣傳。使被×軍事法西政府欺蒙的日本民衆知辨侵略戰爭的是非及得失，確知在華戰爭的慘敗與日本孤立的發展：（B）優待俘虜並加訓練，以事實矯正他們多年所受的軍國主義敎育的惡影響，使知中國人民是他們的良友，他們在中國參加抗戰，無異上了天堂；（C）還要設法防止×人的陰謀和反宣傳，擊破×人的麻醉理論和欺騙。</p>
<p>然而促進日本人民反戰最有力量的因素，還是澈底的抗戰，這是自覺的日本人民所切實要求的。</p>
<h3 id="c2">增博省道的沿線 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>—返惠紀行之六—</p>
<p>一、記陳指揮官</p>
<p>在　後的博羅城一度視察之後、六日决定沿廣惠公路前進、走上增城的前線、行前冉度走訪黃縣長、剛巧在途中會見了、同時還有博羅游擊隊的副指揮官陳潔先生、陳副指揮官也是决　在那天出巡胡　福田等地、記者被　同行、征途中破去許多的寂寞、</p>
<p>出了博羅城、觸目已造殘缺的鄕村、像四寳水、西邊月……離城較近的、一點不能倖脫、可是×人焚燬我們的村莊時、也給抄們英勇的農民們殺傷極大、獲得高貴的代價了、</p>
<p>同行的指揮官陳潔先生、一邊行、一邊娓娓的解說、沒有倦容、陳先生可稱為一位矍鑠的民族老央雄、他年紀已在六十歲以上、一把三四寸長的雪白柔鬚、在寒風中飄飄的吹着、顯示出多麼豪壯的氣慨、他說話堅决而洪亮而激　、沒有一點老年人的徵象、自博羅淪陷而至現在、差不多每天都走上四九十甲、往來博屬各區、指陣和組織擊團隊、不苟安、不畏懼、他的印總給予我們年靑的人無限的鼓舞、尤其他所　、一像我們這樣年紀的人、離死境不遠、這殘餘的生命還　得苟安嗎、不拿去殺敵留有有什麽用？一段話、更具着超人的卓見、失敗主義的懦弱者流、聞之當會興奮吧、所以論到游擊的戰績、博經會比惠陽壯烈、陳先生黃縣長都謙遜說是時間相準備問題、不過就記者的批評、在「人一的關係上、却佔了很大的位置、一個游擊地區的　展、固然需要英勇的幹部、也需要英勇的指揮者、</p>
<p>一幕順民的悲劇</p>
<p>我們走出了團羅七里餘、陳指揮官指着一個鄉村感慨地為記者述說一幕順民的悲劇、那個村以下、全村男丁約百人、在×人侵佔博羅時、大部避到深山裏去、僅留下七八名的老弱、七八名的老弱者、自非×人所欲殺戮的數目、於是第一次搜索時、不但不騷擾、反給以軍米、餅于、騙令全村的男丁回家、領取順民証、如常耕作、第一天回來了四五成第二天回來了七八成、第三天見着沒有　動、便整數的囘來了、×軍知道全數回來、立刻下一個命令、叫全村的男丁排列在村前的曠場、頒發順民證、等到集中在曠塲上時、却架起幾挺的機槍、密集掃射、逃出的至多七八名、纍纍的屍體、　未收埋、我們固然憤激於×人這般××的手段、同時也可憐這批愚蠢的同胞、假如我們拿這六七十人的生命去和×人相拚、試問換取得多麽昂重的代價、可是他們却看不淸楚×人那貌似和善而終屬兇暴的柔懷政策、這無怪陳指揮官的浩嘆了、可見在這搶救民族的時代中、過重視着個人的生命却失了生命、　視看個八的生命却得保存、於是又使記者對陳揮指官的卓見重申欽佩、</p>
<p>三、×人的「匪區」</p>
<p>新作塘離博羅三十里、位於省道惠廣公路和廣河公路交又的中點、幾間疏落的飯店完全被燬、僅餘幾道×人所築的掩蔽工事、胡鎭、響水、平安墟幾個游擊隊的根據地都在新作塘直徑二十里的圓週內、固然是×軍轉運的樞紐、也是我們各地　擊隊襲擊的目標、×人對這個區域感到束于無策、所以稱之為「匪區」、這這是一個光榮的稱呼、</p>
<p>在這區　的鄕村、給×人焚燒盡遍、響水的墟　、本有三百間的住宅和店　、經過了×人四次的焚燒、現在完整的却祗餘一間、但由陳仕南大隊長率領的響水游擊隊、在惠博的各個游擊團　中、也予×人最多的打擊、統計大小襲擊不下三四十次、不斷射殺×兵、破壞橋樑公路、在游擊史中創立了新的一頁、響水墟內和附近的屋宇實在沒有白燒、許多的灰燼中已滴上了許多×人的汚血了、在新作塘沿途的公路旁邊、我發現了許多×人戰馬的還骸、和許多個×人焚屍的火葬土穴、寬約二尺、長約四尺餘、兩端墊以五六寸高的土埠、據土人云、乃用以支乘屍體的頭足兩部、火葬時淋以液體的化學燃料、再鋪上乾柴燃燒、現在穴內留着許多焦　、其中還　有未焚化的一二片骨骼、足徵×人在這區域內傷亡的衆、</p>
<p>×人為了防備游擊隊的襲擊和破壞、惠廣公路博羅段內的沿路橋樑、至少都派有一伍以上士乒常川保衛、蜆岡橋最多、竟超至三百餘人、橋的前後掘有散兵壕和機關槍陣地、如臨大敵、入了黑夜、多更點着汽燈或燃起禾草、一方面警戒、一方面壯胆、不過×人雖防備得這麽嚴密、蜆岡橋仍給我游擊隊破壞了兩次、後來無所洩慣、方肆意的表現他們的×性、大舉焚殺鄰近的現岡和八國等鄉、但焚殺之後、游擊隊的基本隊員的農民們、更深刻的認淸了×人的眞面目、而更加的活躍了、所以游擊隊在×人的眼中、形成神奇無踪的怪物、隨時隨地有吞噬的危險、足够他們鎭天苦惱和驚惶的了、現在×退以後、自衛團經過訓練力量更堅、而且抗×的情緒異常高漲、正是獵捕×人的完備陷　、</p>
<p>四、摩挲×機的蹦遺骸</p>
<p>當去年十月十六日我軍沿重廣公路撤退時、×機成羣日低飛追逐、投彈轟炸、可是×人所誇耀的一天之　鷲」、却給我們擊落一架、墜於離新作塘不遠的八圍村內、而且據說是給我們自衛團用七九步槍擊落的、</p>
<p>×人這次的進攻華南、多半運用空軍的成力、所以在惠州淪陷的前後、×機來得固然很密、而掃射投彈也飛得異常的低、離地面不過二三百尺、在這短距離內、用步槍集中掃射、極易命中、戰地和公路間、正是×機低飛的地區、也正是步槍發揮防空效能的地區、不要使八圍和惠樟公路的吳村獨美、（在同時期內、吳村亦擊落一×機）</p>
<p>向若公路左邊走上七八百步、入了八圍　、　機的殘骸正臥陳在村前的禾田裏</p>
<p>該機為水上　炸機、可是經了焚燒和鄉民憤怒撕毀、外皮多已不全、機　祇撕剩下昭和二字、大約是昭和五六年所造、機裏的發動　、機槍、平槍等件早經鄕民們　走、作他們「以子之矛、攻子之盾」的殺×武器了、機上有座位三憫、據鄉民云、墜下時、機師三名已焚斃、遺骸給他們收拾了埋葬在田裏、由鄕民的指引、我們到那裏略為憑吊、一坏黃土、隆然元起、作了「皇軍一的歸佰地、為了軍×們的爵位、終於埋骨在中原的天野、他們的地下有知、未審有多少哀怨、不過×人所引篇自衆的空中、四大天王一尚且如此結局、何况他們可憐的××、</p>
<p>臨走、記者特為空除鐵架的×人「天之荒鷲」攝得一影、幷撕下機上的太陽徽號留為紀念、</p>

<h3 id="c4">訪問美國友人芮挑蓋　帶來鉅款救濟我學生　幷代運大量藥品至川 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>【本報重慶航訊】同情幷贊助我國抗戰之美國人芮挑菴君，新近由港來滇，日內赴渝，從事救濟我國學生之工作，記者以其曾久住南京，目擊淪陷後之南京情形，昨特趨往訪問，當蒙分別詳告如下：</p>
<p>芮挑菴省謂：日×在京滬一帶之戒備甚嚴，凡外籍人士欲赴南京者，上下軍站，備受日×之無謂糾纏，繁榮的南京，現在已成黑暗地獄殺人放火，皆為「皇軍」之傑作，××搶掠，尤屬「皇軍」之功課，雨花台外，晏若山斤者，被日×殘殺之華人屍體也。（×人且用屍骨做為衣鈕）夫子廟前，櫛比林立者，日×開設之妓院烟館也，此種毒化塲所之收人，卽是傀儡政府之　費。×兵之在南京者，其胆類皆如，漢奸走狗。尤不敢單獨步行，每一個中國人的心目中，無時不懷念中華民國，秘密從事殺×救國之偉大工作，卽偽政府之警察憲兵，亦有參加刺殺漢奸之舉動，凡此種種，足證明中國人心并未被日×之鐵蹄征服。又謂：日本軍閥，現在不敢使其十兵久駐南京，往柱句日卽行調換。此蓋由於日本士兵之反戰情緒與日供增所致。又日偽曾强令在京中外敎十舉行所謂「反蔣」妄動，三令五申，所有敎士均置之不理，偽政府又欲撥用中外敎士共同舉辦難民收容所經費，亦屢被敎士們嚴詞拒絕。清挑菴君之結論云：「日及×漢奸，因南京四郊皆有中國抗日游擊隊，市區內亦常有刺殺漢奸之事發生，故彼　大都惶惶然寢食不安！」</p>
<p>芮挑菴君此次係代表美團靑年會來華從事救濟我國學生之工作，携帶一萬八千元美金作為救濟之用。記者因卽叩詢美國援華運動之現狀；據云：『美國援華工作，可謂與日俱進。美國政府貸欵與中國之情形，余雖不及目睹，惟預蚪今後援華運動，定必因政府之態度積極而更增進，余帶此項救濟金，純係美國靑年學生踴躍輸捐而集成者。今年份之救濟金數額，思必更多，尤足令人興奮者，日本在美之留學生，亦踴躍參加反對日本侵略中國之工作。日本領事，雖嚴加壓迫，仍不生效。關於制止軍火商人售費軍火與日本，及抵制日貨等項運動，目前美國人尤在積極推動中。』</p>
<p>渠此次附帶代四川聯合醫院運送大批藥品（重二千公斤）至川，純由美國募捐而來。現因納關稅之障碍，尙未能起運云。</p>
<p>記者悉伊此次係道經日本來華，繼詢及×國情况，據談：余在其地勾留五日，睹日本國內之經濟力量，則巳凋敝不堪。可斷言其侵華之自食其果，崩潰業已不遠，且最大原因，不外各國一致抵制日貨，以致使其經濟困難，不如在昔之能以大量金錢向外購買軍火。并為限制汽油關係，限　住戶四家，只能共用汽車一輛，且不能超過限制之汽油量。對一切日用物品，均設法以它種物品代替。以豆腐代替鷄蛋以最低劣之土產布，而製和服，一切物價均增加至三成以上。人民之厭戰情緒，已達最高程度。軍閥則以愚民政策，欺騙民衆。自作戰以來，兵士之死數己達八十餘萬。其在國內宣傳，僅言只三萬餘。一般人民，均希望趕速結東戰爭。但少壯軍人，仍惱惱不休。故國內反戰空氣，日益湊緊，非獨人民如此，卽新聞報紙，亦每有為中國宣傳，激起人民反戰，如去年中國之粵漢陷落後。其報紙曾紀載「日本已征服中國矣。一同時將載，「首相召國內軍火製造廠令趕造軍火，以應此長期抗戰。』此卽×人為我宣傳之一例也。談至此，時已午夜，星月朦朧，配者乃與之握別。</p>

<p>— 夢</p>
<p>同濟大學、當上海『八一三一事　時，這個學校在砲火中掙扎了許久、由上海遷至金華、而贛州、而八步、現在由八步遷來昆明、現在他們的新校址、已覓妥在昆明的附近</p>
<p>從八步來昆明的學生有一部份是走海道的、有一部分也是徒步旅行、這些徒步來昆明的學生、並不是完全因為經濟困難、主要原因是他們不願意繞道至河內的外國地、而願意忍苦步行、這是同濟『實事求是』的校風、</p>
<p>中正醫學院、原來在江西南昌郊外、新校舍建成一部分、抗戰事起、南昌成了×機轟炸的目標、為安全計、遙到柳州上課、圾近由柳州遷到昆明來、現正在昆明附近白龍潭草建校舍、一個月後、可以搬在　校址上學、</p>
<p>到達昆明的學生一百餘人、他們於本月廿廿三日暫借靑年會上課了、這是一個公醫性的醫學院、學生肯耐苦、同學間有一種互助相愛的精神、</p>
<p>中山大學是從廣州炮火下跑出來的、廣州十二月廿八日失守、中大的一部辦事員與一部儀器圖書、於廿七日離開廣州、他們的損失僅僅是醫學院與工學院的一部分儀器圖書、其他早已搬出廣州了、同學大多在香港、近來陸陸續續有來到昆明的、他們的校址、覓妥在離昆明一百公里的徵江、</p>
<p>中大自廣州遷出時、所引為遺憾的是一千多萬新建的校舍、還是很完整的落在×人手裏了、說起來這不能不使我們格外的痛心、</p>
<p>沒有上面所說的五個大畢以前、昆明最高學府是雲南大學、它處在文化低落的西南、一切當然無法發展、所以從前的雲南大學、學生的程度頗低、交通不便利的中國內地、敎育的確是受的影響很大</p>
<p>去年暑假、雲大改為國立、敎部命熊嚴來主持校務、熊氏在敎育界多年、這次重返桑梓服務、極力加以整振、在很短的時間、學校的情形不似從前了、聘請名教授、提高學生程度、學生在熊氏嚴餐之下、漸漸養成一種讀書的風氣、這是西南文化進步很值得注意之一點、</p>
<p>（三）文化人</p>
<p>現在昆明的文化人有沈從文、朱自淸、顧頡剛、穆木天、謝冰心、不久以前、沈從文為新動向半月刊寫過幾篇文章、裏邊有『給靑年朋友』一文，是不滿意暑假集訓學生而作、說話很沉痛，但近來少見到他的文章、，朱自淸、穆木　、是中華文藝界抗×協會雲南分會的指導人、穆木天常為雲南的　物寫文章、很受許多靑年人的敬愛、顧頡剛在雲大敎書、他主編益世報的『邊疆』謝冰心到了昆明、沒有見過她的文章、文藝團體中、她不常常到會、大概正在寫作一本新的作品　、</p>
<p>不久以前、矛盾王禮錫夫婦到了昆昨、文化協會特邀請他們在民衆敎育館茶話、朱自淸亦在坐、擠擠一堂、昆明文化界極一時之盛况、王禮錫講國際援華近况、最近又成立了國際反侵略會雲南分會、雲南的文化界、得到他們許多的鼓量、</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>視察前綫若需要長途乘車，×機「光顧」都不怕，就怕車子中途拋錨—我這次北上搭的這輛車，偏是「慕年從公一之物，一經見面，我就有點不放心。不期剛走到湘黔鐵路湘潭站的附近，它忽戞然長嘆了一聲，繼以顫抖數下、就停足宣布：「筋疲力竭，告老致仕！」它的隨從官——機師，百般醫治無效，託我向衡陽發電呼籲。結果是第三天從衡陽開來「救護車一，將它拖回醫好再來。於是我個人只好計劃開始單獨行動，採用游擊戰術，先渡江去湘潭，繼搭湘黔車去株州，由株州轉粵漢路北上，去長沙，去汩羅，去……事關「游擊軍秘」，恕不預發支票。</p>
<p>幾乎被火燬去，而為「長沙焦土第二」的湘潭，從公路上隔着湘江望過去，她像湘江的一個身材修長的情侶，緊靠湘江的左身橫臥着，她修長得簡直令人看見頭就不能看見脚。故沙入好拿她的長形姿態，去和鄰封　　長湘塊狀的市景比擬，稱為「長沙是一片。湘潭是一線。」</p>
<p>渡口在湘黔鐵路新建橋墩的下游，但划起渡舟來，還要斜逆水從橋下穿過。橋墩高約七八丈，半沒水中，半露水面，一個個雄糾糾地矗立在江上，好像一排高大而嶄新的寳塔，遠望近看都非常的壯觀。可惜受×人侵略影響，現在不得不暫時輟工。</p>
<p>登岸入城，走了一段很長很長的路，才到繁華區的正街。該城主要街道，僅有三條，均與湘江併行，故作「川」字形：靠近江岸的那條叫「河街」，當中這條，就叫「正街」，其餘一條呌「後街」。後街與河街，商情較冷落，中街則甚熱鬧，商業如綢緞，布匹，百貨各店，以及旅館飯舖等，卽多在中街，羅列經營。那時天色已晚，電燈初亮，來往路人，猶甚擠擁。各商店門市生意，亦極形熱閙。本來湘潭是湘江的一個碼頭，新近又是湘黔路東端變相的起卸站（該路本通車至株州，而與粵漢，浙贛兩路交接，但因「湘江鐵橋」輟工，故將湘潭形成一個起卸站），從知「地靈」實將玉成她陸續走上繁榮之境，可是目前她之所以驟得崎形的繁榮，例如商店營業牧入之激增，旅館飯舖之客滿，車夫苦力之可多賺錢，這都是在長沙大火後才突然發生的現象。換句話說：湘潭目前之畸形繁榮，確因長沙大火，「人」「財一四散，湘潭以近水樓台，大量吸收，故得發此一筆橫財也。</p>
<p>不過，湘潭雖幸運發了長沙大火的一筆橫財，，但也險些兒遭了長沙大火的「魚池之殃」，一陣烈火濃烟便化為烏有去了！</p>
<p>當長沙大火時，湘潭以逼近該地，傷兵難民，潮湧而來。中有所謂「放火隊」者，亦相繼抵達，一謁縣府，即分向各橫街房屋，架扶梯，出火具，準備對那三條「川」字形的繁華街道，作竹節式的縱火大燒！</p>
<p>他們——放火隊——舉動熟練，言詞激昂，不會被疎散或逃避了的市民，也不敢干預他們。那種尖銳到無以復加的危機，很像三國時代。吳將周瑜準備火燒赤壁曹兵，事前將放火還未放火的一剎那，原因僅僅是：『諸事齊備。祗欠東風』了！</p>
<p>這次，湘潭將火未火時所吹的東風，也是操之在孔明似的一個人手裏；所以不同者，孔明的東風，須作法去借，這個人的東風，却貨眞價實的含在他口裏，只要他肯吐了出來，那必然就將湘潭送到烈燄噴騰的火海裏，辟辟剎剝的一陣就燒或「長沙焦土第二」去了！可是他別有卓見，認為勿庸吐出，于是坐在火山口上的湘潭，終于被他搶救出來。</p>
<p>「長沙焦土第二！」這原是有幾分煽惑性的光榮名詞；當長沙大火本身是非尙未判明的時候。據聞前縣長×氏，見前方情况不明，亦以「壯烈犧牲一的理由，請那人贊同湘潭效法長沙，趕快實行焦土。否則遲恐不及。那人答說『我在此有守土之責，未奉命撤退，尤未見×而被戰敗，雖寸草亦必力為保衞。何况是數十萬人口生命財產所寄託的城市，豈可不察實情，而付諸一火？然果欲作壯烈犧牲，亦宜展期三日再定。』可是事實上到了第二天，長沙大火之錯誤，即大白于天下。在湘潭敬候「東風」之放火隊，遂被解除武裝，發洋遣散，湘潭市民相率婦來，見　舍儼然，鷄犬無恙。嗣獲得其情，私衷彌感，乃　金二萬元，并特製一錦幛，文曰：「萬家生佛！」以恭謝那人。那人辭金受幛，旋奉命率部他調；及抵目的地、則復如數匯至矣。</p>
<p>那人究竟是誰　連我也未曾識荆；因我到此間時。他已離開一月多了。但從講給我這故事者的口吻中，聽出他是一位姓杜的師長。另有一條從城廂通至汽車站的公路，也是他提倡以兵工修築的；市民勒石命名「聿功路」，以示不忘。度一聿功」二字，非其名，必其號也。</p>
<p>這段可歌可泣的故事、雖然產生在兩月以前，但那時一般人的視聽，均集中在空前絕後的長沙大火：同時湘潭地處後方，此次瞼些兒倫為「長沙第二」之危機，又已微妙地解險于無影無形中———所以這故事偉大的經過，外間還很少有人知道。然而我之樂為記述，意義倒不單純看重於故事本身的新聞價值，也不是想發揚故事中人的潛德幽光，而是想藉此以引起大家對於與這故事有關聯的其他重要問題之研究和認識。</p>
<p>第一，在第二期抗戰中，我最高領袖曾揭示要旨，有謂：一以後抗戰勝利之基礎，全在于我能獨立作戰………獨立自主。」今由湘潭「化險為夷一，故事觀之，証明我一般守土將領中，能具有自動性自覺性負責性的「獨立自主」之精神，己大不乏人。此即奠定勝利基礎條件之一。</p>
<p>第二，我量高領袖又說：「要求達成任務不可作無謂犧牲。」這當然包括人力和物質而言。湘潭之不輕于焦土以言犧牲，卒完成守土之任務，這是第二胡抗戰主要精神進步之一表證。亦奠定勝利基礎條件之二。</p>
<p>第三，湘潭駐軍能盡力的保護當地人民財產，而人民亦能竭誠向軍隊表示敬愛，這是軍民眞正打成一片，精誠團結抗戰的鐵澄，同樣也是奠定勝利基礎條件之三。</p>
<p>第四，目前正在進展中的抗戰工作，正是我中華兒女，生逢「時聲造英雄」，「英雄造時勢」的大好機會，在前線得英勇殺×，固易建立不世之殊助，存後方能憑其天良，用盡其智力、如杜將軍之力挽湖潭大難，亦未嘗不可卓立偉功　千古良機難再，同胞其各自勉！</p>
<p>第五，全面抗戰，區域廣達十餘省，戰線延長數千里，活躍在前後方的敷十百萬軍民中，具有杜將軍卓議定力者必很多，有意無意地造成湘潭「萬家生佛」一類功績的亦必不少，這是我們民族抗戰精神偉大的表現，也是我們民族抗戰成功史珍貴的一頁，我們不應該　其自生自滅，應該把收集珍存起來。</p>

<p>— 王劍鳴譯</p>
<p>美國是最後一個與蘇聯建立正式關係的大資本主義國家。儘管美國的公共團體一再請求與蘇聯建立正常的外交關係，反動的胡佛政府總沒有接受美國人民的要求。僅在共和黨于一九三二年競選失敗，由羅斯福領導的民主黨登台之後，兩國政府之間的正式關係才于一九三三年建立起來。</p>
<p>在該年的五月，羅斯福總統給了蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里寧一個通牒，他在裏面指出正式關係的缺如，是一種反常的情形，並提議請蘇聯派遣代表去作建立正常外交關係的磋商，以及互換使節，蘇聯便派人民外交委員李維諾夫作為代表。</p>
<p>對于和平的共同努力</p>
<p>一九三三年十一月七日，李維諾夫在對美國新聞記者的談話中喚起對于下列情形的注意，卽為人的隔閡直至該時尙存在于兩國之間，『其實我們民主國家的人民從未停止過以最大的同情與誠摯的善意致力于相互的進步』。並且指出『在兩國的利益中有一種堅實的基礎以作科學的，文化的與經濟的合作』，因此兩者便為『一種對于和平的共同努力所結合起來』。</p>
<p>在一九三三年十一月十六日，羅斯福已與李維諾夫交換了關于建立兩國正常外交關係的公文。</p>
<p>此後過去的五年，已經証實了下列的事實，卽蘇美政府之間正式關係的缺如皆是由于美國反動勢力作梗所教、尤其是哈特的黃色報紙，卽在今日還繼續誹謗蘇聯，以及傳播各種關於蘇聯的虛偽消息。美國的反動勢力　于兩國在國際上合作起來以阻止侵略與爭取和平，是不發生興趣的。</p>
<p>美國人民的友誼</p>
<p>然而美國大衆對于蘇聯在經濟各方面，與在文化生活上的巨大成功，對于它的有力而和平的政策，皆知道得很淸楚。蘇聯所遵循的一貫的和平政策與反侵略政策，在美國性質極相殊異的各界中獲得了衷心的反應。兩國政府在世界各處求取和平的合作，巳在美國人民最廣大的階層中受到禮讚，他們對于維持和平是感到興趣的。</p>
<p>應該注意的是美國在反侵略鬥爭中之缺乏堅持力，乃由于孤立情緒所支持的反動勢力壓迫所致，這種情緒仍盛行於小資產階級之中。獨佔資本不僅對于反法西侵略的鬥爭不感興趣，而且無所不至的帮助法西國家。</p>
<p>美蘇人民之間的關係，被一種不變的友誼興同情的精神所顯一示出來。當空中英雄從莫斯科經北極不停地飛到美國而在那裏逗留的時候，美國人民對蘇聯表示出他們特殊的同情。一看見英勇的蘇聯飛行家，美國人民便歡呼偉大的社會主義國家。</p>
<p>最近數年，在經濟方面已顯示出貿易經常擴充與發展。在一九三三年，美蘇之間的貿易總額達到二二·七八〇，〇〇〇金元，去年則達到七三·六〇〇，〇〇〇金元。貿易已在逐年擴展，本來的材料顯示出兩國之間經濟關連更進一步的鞏固。商約的締結便利了他的成長，在五月裏該約又展期十二個月。</p>
<p>文化關係的發展</p>
<p>美蘇人民之間的文化關係，也發展得很有成就。兒童藝術展覽會，史達林憲法展覽會，與蘇聯建築展覽會等，參與者有數千美人，獲得了巨大的成功。開演于美國銀幕上的蘇聯影片，幾經常地贏得親衆的讚美與好評。甚至反動的報紙也不得不承認它們的成功。</p>
<p>除已有的美蘇文化協會與蘇聯之友社外，還有最近成立的美蘇邦交促進會。該會的目的是在于使蘇聯的和平政策與在社會主義建設方面的成就成為家喻戶曉。</p>
<p>明年（指今年——譯者）蘇聯的參加紐約國際展覽會，對于令美人週知蘇聯在政治，經濟與文化方面的成就，將起一種重要的作用。</p>
<p>兩國的關係無疑的將秉美蘇人民友誼的精神與相互的同情繼續發展下去、因為兩大民族對于維持全世界的和平皆有興趣，</p>

<p>張伯倫內閣一年來妥協外交的結果，一方面是壯大了法西斯侵略者的氣焰，另一方面是造成了奧國，捷克以至西班牙的淪亡及近于淪亡。同時英法在歐洲以至在世界的地位，亦受極大惡劣影響·因此英國內部具有止義及遠見的人士，發起反對運動，近來日趨激烈，這是不容諱言的。這種情形不僅不是張伯倫內閣之福，而且也不是整個世界之福。</p>
<p>要打破這種險惡的現狀，除了英法人民陣綫在薛聯美國的積極政策下獲得勝利，便只有張伯倫內閣在內外交迫之下放棄妥協政策，從加緊英法合作開始，强化和平民主陣綫，共同打擊法西斯侵略者。</p>
<p>倫敦七日電稱：張伯倫首相於六日午後在下議院宣佈：『英法兩國具有連帶一致關係，法國生存攸關之利益遇有威脅時，不問此項威脅來自何處，英國必須立卽與法國合作。』張伯倫這篇談話，自然是蘇聯美國最近援助民主國家的表示及英國國內反對妥協運動的反映。張伯倫這次宣言，對於和平民主陣綫，自然會發生日　鞏固的影晌，對于法西斯侵略者，亦可作為重大的抵抗力量，惟首先將是張伯倫政權可以由此獲得暫時的穩定。因此，我們得說一聲，『恭喜，張伯倫先生！』</p>
<p>但是，以嚇詐而『發　』的希特勒和墨索里尼，對於這種宣言，至多是在報紙上表示驚愕和抗議而己，墨索里尼之徙，甚至在冷言　諷說：『如果你踏着了獅子的尾巴，它于定會張牙嚇人，但是一「排假牙齒」—因此，我們必須加緊英法兩國人民推動其政府，繼續這種『聯合抵抗侵略』的宣言之後，立卽實現以實力制裁侵略者—我們所要恭喜的不在於張伯倫政權的由危轉安，而是民主和平陣綫的强化，造成圍剿法西斯侵略者的無敵的陣容。</p>

<p>本港民航事業發達、遠東四大航綫（汛美、帝航、法航、荷印）之在本港設立中站者、已佔其三、所餘僅茶印公司（全名爲荷蘭東印度皇家航空公司）、據該公司律濱代表侯頓氏稱、荷印綫亦將由八打威至西貢一綫、伸展至香港、俾與汛美綫聯絡云云、此說倘成事實、則本港將成爲美荷英法及遠東各地空航綫之總樞矣、關于上述消息、本港各航空當局、雖皆謂尙未接得確訊、然亦謂此舉實為天然之發展、至傳英荷當局已在倫敦商議此問題亦大有可能性云、査荷印公司、　已徵求美國同意、欲增設爪哇至岷尼刺一綫、後以華盛頓方面、久不置覆、始轉易其目標向香港發展、該航綫如早得美方同意舉辦、則無庸在港設站、因其目的實欲與汎美線取得聯絡而已、又査荷印綫與荷航綫（全名爲荷國皇家航空綫）兩公司、素有聯絡、荷航綫爲母公司、以奄士打丹當總站、其航綫遍于歐洲大陸、并有定期航綫行走奄城與爪哇、而以八打威爲總站、荷印綫則僅限于荷屬東印度羣島、有機行走澳洲、西貢、打力根、及波羅洲北部、荷航當局將特製DC四式快機、干明年參加飛航八打威至奄城線、幷增設夜航班、將來該段航程、可由五日半減至兩日半、如是、該綫若在港設立中站、則由倫敦至港、可減至四日、査DC四式機、日間飛航可載客四十人、夜航則僅十六人云、</p>
<h3 id="c32">閩茶運港集中輪出後　銷路破四十年紀録　去年售出共達九萬箱　所獲盈利二百餘萬元 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>本　特訊、茶葉不僅是閩省最大宗的特產、而且是最重要的輸出品、每年出產在一千萬元以上、過去在國際間也有相當的地位、但是近幾年來、因爲製茶的方法不加以改進、品質也就因而　於衰落、其他如運輸的梗塞、資本的缺乏、都是閩茶的致命傷、營業因此大爲减色、而其中最大的打擊、就是台灣、錫蘭等地的茶產、大量向南洋歐美各地傾銷、閩茶的地位、差不多被整個侵奪了、後釆危機更深、閩省政府也不能坐視、因此拿出政府的力量、决加以整理、首先派員到南洋錫蘭各地攷察、以爲改良的張本、繼設立紅茶連銷處、對運銷海外的荼葉加以統制、設茶倉管理所、貯藏運到福州的茶葉、幷加以險　、由去年四月起、更把原有的改良茶葉機關合併起來、設立茶葉管理處、</p>
<p>去年、正常荼葉開始的時候、却爲了×人進犯閩有、厦門不幸陷落了、福州的防務、也突然吃緊、茶葉是福建的生命綫、對外貿易、不能一旦中斷、因此茶葉管理處便把全部外銷的茶葉運到本港、一則可以較爲安全、二則對外運銷、更爲便利、當時除了首春、白毫兩種田爲商人和洋行的要求、提前開盤在福州售出外、其餘外貿的茶葉、完全運到本港來、因此「五、十」戰事之後、閩茶外銷、可以說完全集中於本港、</p>
<p>去年福建運到本港的茶葉、直到年底止、共計大約有十二萬箱、售出的約有九萬箱左右、在存　的三萬箱中、大部份是附產品的片末、精茶很少、所剩的精茶、十分之七八是閩北小種、只有十分之二三是工夫茶、閩茶的銷路、以去年來說、蘇聯佔大多數、歐美略爲遜色、售價方面、大約比較往年超出百分之五六十或二三十、這個數目、可以說已打破了閩荼四十年來的紀錄、此中的原因、並不是因爲茶　的偶然提高的結果、而是在此時會中、閡省的茶　、和皖贛兩湖的出產、同時集中於香港、同在一個市場上、公開佈樣、評質價、閩省的茶葉、確是比較其他省份超出一等、眞正優點、得以表異、所　閩茶外　、在去年下半年的幾個月中、有這麼長足的進步、統計去年閩茶運來本港外銷所獲的盈利、共達二百餘萬元之多、這完全是因爲閩省政府對茶葉銳加改革的結果、（雋）</p>

<p>協會總幹事蔡葵士女訪問記</p>
<p>祖國在新生中，警覺的女性亦朝着時代的朝陽而挺身邁進着。—女靑年會全國協會總幹事蔡葵女士和世界女靑中會副主席　桂葆女士前晚在央京酒店招待婦女界的盛會及吾們誠懇的展望，經誌昨天本報，在此不便多所贅述了。記者爲明瞭全國女靑年協會在抗戰中的動態起見，昨天冉行訪問蔡葵女士，又得到不少令人感　的村料。</p>
<p>前天晚上記者是因事中間退席的，二見蔡女十的時候，她就很奮與地說：</p>
<p>『這眞是一個難得的機會，這次的聚會不　是本港的嫦女界代表與先進都踴　出席，而且廣州，漢口，北平，南京，上海，昆明各地女靑年分會都有　表參加　因此我就很高興地把女靑年會全國　會　近的工作槪况向大家報吿，並希望各地分會在工作上配合起來。發展起來，何香凝先生欣喜這是全國各地婦女代表的一個難得歡聚，亦興緻十足地訓勉有加。大意是說「靑年會所標榜的自由，平等，博愛與中山先生的民挨，民權·民生·是互相吻合的，這是中國今日最迫切的要求。希望大家把握着優良的環境，朝着這個目標而努力。……」我不懂得廣州話，只知道大槪是這麼梯』。</p>
<p>蔡女士原籍是浙江金華，在女靑年會服務十多年了。普通話說得還很流利</p>
<p>掉上主題，蔡女士很和靄地答着記者的叩問：</p>
<p>「女靑年會全國協會共有一萬多個會昌，包含各階層的份子，全國各城市設有分會者共有十九處，因戰事而停頓的有三四處，總會的基金充足，每年收入除世界各國捐欵外，各地分會每年亦要繳納會費於總會如香港，天津，每年都要繳上一千元國幣去，可是幼稚水能獨立　分會，則由總會扶助，俟其成長然後放手，像昆明的分會，大部份經費就是由總會津貼，」</p>
<p>——記者以爲這就充分表現着母性養育兒女的精神啊！</p>
<p>蔡女士繼續着說：</p>
<p>『這次來港與香港分會發動募集事業費共募得一萬六千餘元，三分之二歸香港分會，三分之一歸總會，這是經濟方面的大略情形。</p>
<p>女靑年會全國協會在抗戰中作過什麽國際宣傳呢？蔡女士謂：</p>
<p>「全世界五十八個國家都有女靑年會　組織，我們把×人的暴行向各國女靑年會報吿像對自己家人報吿一樣，她們表示同情與援助的電訊有如雪片飛來，宗敎團體亦紛紛巷我們祈禱，匯來援助我們抗戰的捐欵在十萬以上，全世界女靑年總會的大會我們中國亦有代表出席參加，黄桂葆女士就是該會的副主席」。</p>
<p>女靑年會全國協會以　各地分會在抗戰中還做過什麽具體的工作呢？</p>
<p>蔡女士把：一，救護與救濟；二，宣傳與組織；三，戰時敎育及技術敎育的普及；四，從事工業生產之倡導等四個工作綱領，逐一地替記者解釋得很詳細。給記者印象較深刻的是：抗戰之前，總會已辦過六期救護班，戰事發生之後，就分派到各傷兵病院服務。爲减少前方將士有後顧之憂，還發動出征家屬服務運動。用精神上，物質上種種方法，慰勉軍人家屬。好像講抗戰故事給他們聽，都收到很大的效力。</p>
<p>小學生捐出了錢，就將錢購買衣料給女靑年會朋衣裁縫，然後再交還小朋友親自將一堆堆的棉衣抬去勞軍，小孩與女同志都覺得無限欣慰，將士亦深深受其感動。</p>
<p>學生要是經濟困難的，就予以救濟。還有很多失業婦女，生活很苦，就指導她們從事各種工業充實生產。各地雖然有各地的情形，但是，都是在「抗戰第一」總目標之下，分頭努力。——這是他們工作的一個輪廓。</p>
<p>蔡女士日間將離港赴昆明。貴陽，重慶視導各地女靑年會戰時工作動態。預計四月底可以回到總會。</p>

<h3 id="c43">崑山　北大悲殿在懷念中 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 李因非</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>「小樓昨夜又東風」、引起的是「故國不堪回首月的中」之感、冷雨敲意、爐火止紅、在這萬籟俱寂的晚上、更容易使人懷念起遠地的友人來、「去年天氣舊亭　」、昔日生死與共的伙伴們、如今飄流到了何方了呢、北大悲殿裏的生活像一團火、三五十個靑年人在工作了一天之後、吃罷了晚飯、不肯就散、戀靈地大家守住着桌子前的洋蠟、娓娓　述說着自己的抱負和身世、、或是、雄　地討論着一個問題、那簡直是昨天的事情、然而正是「往事如昨」、如今北大悲殿又是怎樣一副情況、共同在這種生活了半月以上的伙昨們、如今又流飄在何方、當他們在行軍時、當他們在休息　、見到當頭的明月、想到那熱烈幸福的半月團聚生活、他們有怎樣的感觸呢、——戰士的眼光和心境、是祗有前面的老年人和生之落伍者才有回憶、因爲他們惟有靠熱烈的回億來　暖他們快要冷却的胸膛、　伴們如今還是在守住着未盡的洋蠟熱烈地檢討今日的工作　、</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>「行到那舊院門、何用輕敲、也不　小犬哞　、無非是枯井頽巢、不過些磚苔砌草、手　的花條柳梢、儘意兒採樵、這黑灰是誰家廚　？」——孔尙任哀紅南『太平令」是、我老了、何以我儘有些囘憶？</p>
<p>在我的記憶中、北大悲殿不是我上面所引那首一太平令」那樣的、它坐落在崑山百花街（夢花街　）上、離崑山公園沒有百步之遙、馬鞍山之的「晨鐘暮鼓」（註）隨着秋風、很淸澈地向我們提出警吿、</p>
<p>北大悲殿是座尼菴、四週和內部太容易使我們　起魯迅先生在「阿Q正傳」中頭寫的「靜修菴：」「粉牆突出在新綠裏、後面的低土牆裏是菜園、一「靠西牆是竹　、一還有、那是在菴後的、有三枝枝葉茂盛的桂樹、這大概是靜修菴所沒有的、</p>
<p>我們搬進去住的時候、尼菴裏的師太們都已避難下鄉去了、有一間房子貼着封條、裏面橫七豎八的堆着雜物、其他的房麥、便空無所有、</p>
<p>我們把前大殿作爲會客室和膳廳、後大殿改爲宿舍、師太們的雲房、則安頓爲同志住、或是作爲辦公室、</p>
<p>我們在這裏共同生活也共同工作、三五十個靑年人的心結台成爲一條心、三五十個靑年人的性命、也連接在一　、你我的界限消除了、都市署傳染來的虛僞被洗滌盡、忠誠坦自得像最友愛的同胞兄弟、</p>
<p>尤其難忘的是晚上、工作了一天的疲勞、在晚飯間消除了、離規定睡的時間還早、晚上要沒有特殊勤務、天上又是有一天好的月色、這時候、坐在桌子前守着洋蠟、或是到屋外去散散　、舒散一下、傾訴着自己見聞或憧、便成爲愉快的習慣</p>
<p>因生活是愉快的、就也連帶地愛好起這和伙伴們生活在一起的大悲殿夾、每晚躺在稻草舖上又暖又香、午夜夢囘、窗外射進來一片月色、神龕前的琉璃燈微明着隱約地可以看到神龕裏觀音大士慈祥的臉、朦朧地便感到沈墜在詩裏、伙伴們的鼾聲、也就成爲音樂的節奏、在這詩和音樂中、朦朧地又不知不覺地墜入睡鄕、——而現在、這一切就祗有在夢境中去享受了、</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>現在北大悲殿成了刦灰了嗎、還有那手築的坊空壕、現在已否坍塌、在那竹林裏、用小刀笨拙地刻着記念宇句的字跡、還存在嗎、</p>
<p>一切讓它燬了吧、我們會在這舊的基地上建築起新的來、洋澄湖的蟹正肥、又鮮又嫩的鴨麵、是最好的晨點、我們三五上個靑年人、是會在這裏車叙、是會在這裏慶祝我們的勝利、喝我們的凱旋酒的、</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>「無可奈何花落去、似曾相識燕歸來、小園香徑獨徘徊」（曼殊、浣溪沙）、此時此地、不僅是懷鄉病者有苦難訴、也且是旅行者悲哀的年季、但這樣的日子是不會長久的、隔不到三年、我們將成爲似曾相識的歸燕、重履成們昔日懷念的地土、在這上面舊的雖是毀了、但新的將超過以前的建立起來、</p>
<p>我們不必問何年伺月才能重履故土、我們所要問的、自己有否重履故土的决心、現在又正在幹着些什麽、</p>
<p>註　戰時的崑山、馬鞍山上用鐘鼓表示空襲　報、警報時用鐘、解除時用鼓、而山離戰區不遠、警報幾乎每天早晨響後、無時或斷、迄至晚間始歇、故同伴們羣以晨鐘慕鼓形容之、</p>
<p>園然、中國各地的交通、尙多艱阻、中國的旅行事業、還沒普遍、可是這次的戰事、巳經給了我們一個很好的敎訓了、看看報上一個個的地名、我祗有痛恨自己、爲甚麼平時不去走走呢、</p>
<p>可是我終究算是到過黄山了、這在我痛恨自己之餘、未始不是一個小小的安慰、</p>
<p>我懷念黄山、我將永久懷念着黄山、</p>

<p>愚自廿六年秋抵英、駒光如流、轉瞬半載於茲、在此六閱月問、倫敦諸勝、雖已縱覽殆遍、顧首都以外、尙有不少淸奇偉麗之區、足資遊觀、輒以未獲一往、引爲憾事、殘冬已逝、大地春回、同鄕易企衡兄、適在司丹福電氣公司實習、以本年入春以來、氣候和煦、擬於清明休假期間激予作竟日之清遊、予欣然報可、司丹福爲英國中部之一鎭、去京都約二百英里、火車三小時可達、予於四月廿四日晨九時半赴幽思敦車站、附乘星期日之遊覽專車、自倫至司、三等票價原爲十七先令六便十、而當日來囘之遊覽票、僅收七先令九便士、此蓋鐵路公司爲鼓勵遊客、故特予廉價、爲招徠計也、車出倫敦、遂行於廣大無垠之原野、遠山　、林木蔚然、蒼翠之氣、撲人眉宇、予久居都市、深以喧囂爲苦、此時置身郊外、瀟然出　、俗念爲之一淸焉、</p>
<p>下午一時抵司、較諸規定時間已遲三十分、時來站相候者、除易君外、尙有與易君同廠實習之簡寅官君、又甫自孟却斯德來司之高德强、呂德寬二君、高君亦籍南通、在孟城攻紡織、此次尙係初面、簡君籍江都、呂君爲丹徒、我輩五人同隸一省、亦巧合也、出站用餐後、在司丹福街頭閒步、司鎭人口寥落、商業不興、市壓所在、僅爲長不足半哩之大街、所可注意者、即市政規劃、初不以小鎭　稍遜舉凡市政廳、敎堂、公園、學校、醫院無不俱備、而市容尤爲整肅、此殆英國各地之一般現象也、易君爲予言、今日我輩之遊程、已定爲近郊之愛爾登古堡、具地距司鎭約廿哩、素有英島仙境之稱、春夏之秋、遊驄常繫、蓋不僅爲司鎭之名區、亦全英之勝蹟　、</p>
<p>司丹福汽車公司爲便利遊侶起見、星朋日特開遊覽車、可以載客直達其地、車原定以二時出發、以是日春寒料峭、遊客無幾、除我輩五人外、尙無餘子、乃一再守候、最後始有兩英人加入、該車可容四十人、今纔得七人、戔戔所入、恐尙不敷油資也、車出司鎭、即行於叢山之中。公路因地勢之高下、而蜿蜓的起伏於其間、其險峻處令人危懼不置、英國農村景色、頻具畫意、萬綠叢中、時有朱樓一角、掩映。間者、其農人之田舍也、聞英國各地、即在窮鄉僻壞、亦有自來水煤氣電氣可用、由此而言、英國農民生活之舒適、與我國相較、誠不可同日而語矣、</p>
<p>車行一小時許而抵愛爾登山、古木森森流泉潺潺、其地景色、頗似杭州之韜光竹徑、而山勢迂迴、道途平坦、又類南京之陵園、　游至此、悵　萬端、囘首祖國、不知涕泗之何從矣、汽車　徑山直上、至一售票處、有人登車售票、　每人一先令蓋已抵愛爾登堡之人口矣、由此再進半哩、峯迴路轉、豁然開朗、而雄據山巔之古堡、亦接觸于吾人之眼簾焉</p>
<p>愛爾豋堡之名勝、可分兩部分言之、一爲堡之本身、一爲附於隣近之花園、予等下車後、首遊名園、是園位於古堡之左、介於衆某之間爲一幽谷、整個花園、即佈置於此幽谷之中、廣約百畝、曲折通之、中鎜一河、爲山間羣泉之總匯、點綴於此園者、則爲無數之奇卉異葩、花團錦簇、燦然悅目、不啻一幅天然圖畫也、予等循小徑前進、不數十武、遙望一線銀　、直射上空、趨前視之、則有一高可尋丈之八角亭、凡三層、　際懸以鈴鐸、頗似倣自東　者、亭在河中、其頂尖裝一噴水管、管啓水射、如濺珠飛玉、白光映之、幻爲五彩、遠望最　、爲全園設計之最工者、嗣於亭　見一指示牌、謂可由此至中國寺院、予儕見之、大喜逾望、蓋不圖於三萬里外之英島仙鄉、乃有此故國風物、欣然就其所示之途徑而上、乃歷時久久、遍覓不得、登高四矚、亦無寺院之影蹤、其時道旁有一水泥所建之三層方塔、姑往一登、俾於此再行瞭望、比造其絕頂、仍無所見、失望之餘、或笑謂我儕所登臨者豈卽所謂中國寺院乎、顧該塔本身尙不類中國之塔、遑論寺院、方擬下塔再行尋覓間、適一西人手持導遊　、窺之則圖中所標示之中國寺院、果郎吾人登臨處也、疑國至此始釋、西人對於中國之事物、往往一知半解、牽强附會、今觀所謂中國寺院者乃竟如此、指鹿爲馬、抑何可晒、由此一端、可知若輩誤解中國、類此者不知凡幾作、</p>
<p>下塔觀飛瀑、瀑不甚巨、惟兩旁山坡、雜蒔花卉、紛紅駭綠、美乃無勢、身臨其地、環顧左右、彷彿人在書中、信不媿爲洞天福地矣、時見對山叢林之中、有洋摟一幢、炊烟縷縷、似有人居、乃造其　、則爲一瑞士寄廬　、放舍而兼餮室也、予儕在此略進茶點、女主人約翰生小姐朁女侍者數人笑相迎、速客就座、　天眞柔美之神情、令人瀟然意遠、環境移人、有如此者、</p>
<p>出園至一巨沙、可以泛舟、時斜陽已薄崦嵫、白香山所謂「日沉紅有影、風定綠無波」者、最堪爲此寫昭、旋遊古堡、堡爲一封建時代之宮殿、全爲石製、　圖樣爲純粹之哥德式、其中包含高塔—　　、或方或　、或高或下、形式不一、而備極美觀、堡外原有河　、懸橋貫之、在昔入晚卽將懸橋吊起、所以杜敵人之進攻也、今水已涸、無復當年氣槪矣、全部建聚、雄偉遠在倫敦堡之上、考之史乘、山地原爲夏斯保伯爵之采　、距今二百年前、伯爵斥資於其地建一巨堡、爲其居　、一八二七年伯爵逝世、工程猶未吿竣、其後人賡續經營、始底於成、宮室之外、又治園囿、費　計達一百萬鎊之戶、可謂駭人聽聞矣、堡內有大廳、有敎堂、有花園、有畫室、至爲精緻、今其中已闢爲餐館、大好宮室、原爲子孫萬年之計、乃未及二百年即物換星移、一變至此、豈夏雷斯保伯爵當日夢想所及耶、</p>
<p>堡之右尙有旗堡、亦爲石製之高塔、蓋所以司瞭望者、吾人登其絕巔、則崗嶺起　、悉收眼底、誠全山最勝處也、　遊旣　、仍乘原車回司丹　、是晚午夜二時、予附車返倫教、侵晨五時抵遺、曉風殘月、倫敦猶在酣睡丑也、</p>

<h3 id="c47">黃山紀遊（二） <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 黄嘉音</p>
<p>中國畫之山</p>
<p>自己是一個是好繪畫的人、可是旣然不好、又沒有機會學習繪　、平時祇能盡量翻閱一些關於繪畫理論的書、鑑賞一些偉大畫家的作品而已、</p>
<p>大槪是因爲環境的關係吧、　來非常　　、生而爲中國人、對於中國的繪畫、毫無所知、我個人對於繪畫的認識、可說是很粗淺的、可是老實說、我對欣賞西洋畫的能力、倒比欣賞中國畫的能力稍强、</p>
<p>因爲見聞不廣的關係、我向來以爲中國的山水畫是可笑的、我甚至有輕視中國以畫的傾向、爲那種雲霧籠罩着的高山峻嶺、深山的中飛泉、山崖上描長出來的怪　、都不過是中國畫家的狂想、我以爲中國畫都不是寫實的、我以爲中國畫沒有甚麽重大的價值、</p>
<p>自從黄山之遊以後、我開始敬重中國書了、我對於中國畫的槪念、完全改變了過來、走入了黄山的深、處看、前面不是一幅雄偉的中國山水畫嗎、看、又是一幅、又是一幅、簡直是看不完的中國畫、黄山眞是中國畫之山、我不是在遊黄山、我是在中國畫中遊歷啊、</p>
<p>我痛恨自己</p>
<p>自己是不常　動的人、偶然走動起來、當然　得更可紀念、何况所到的是那樣令人懷念的地方呢、</p>
<p>自從戰事發生以後、我曾經痛恨過自己、看見報上那樣耳熟的地名、那麽近、那麽重要、那麽　親的地方、平時爲甚麽不去走走呢、</p>

<p>— 吳馬</p>
<p>蠶種場僅對『華中蠶絲公司』發生關係、這不特種價多少、和『華中公司』應否給種塲以代價等、都得由『公司』來隨便决定、而且『華中公司』可以拿蠶種直接換取農民的法幣、以軍用票或是僞幣　種塲、如此一來、蠶種塲還不是日人的附庸、</p>
<p>關於第五條：　視似乎與農民有利、但什麽都在日人掌握中的時候、蠶種塲巳僅對『華中蠶絲公司』方面負責任、故所謂賠償也者、照手續上講：當然是先由蠶種場賠償『華中蠶絲公司』、再由「華中蠶絲公司」賠償給農民、這樣：一期蠶訊結束後、『華中蠶絲公司』要付給種塲的種價倒可拿成績不良來作例子、以作賴掉一半種價的理由、甚至還　勒令種場加倍賠價損失、至於處在『日僞』淫威之下的農民、原來是看至日人運躱避奔逃都來不及、誰敢因爲蠶作不豐而去找尋日本人、就使是退一萬步講、日本人眞正是有心賠償農民損失的話、</p>

<p>娛樂——富家女的秘密</p>
<p>There　Goes　My　Henrt</p>
<p>是一部美國式的笑片、故事的取材與及情節的編排、完全是為達到喜劇的目的、導演出奇制勝的手法、在本片中給觀眾製佫了不少新鮮的笑料、劇情的瘋狂諧趣也、很有引人入勝的力量、</p>
<p>片中描寫一個不經世故而渴慕自由的富家女的出走、同時怎樣的與一個記者在特殊的形境之下發生戀愛的故事、</p>
<p>弗德立馬區和薇琪尼白羅絲、都不是很高明的諧角、在片中沒有什麼成就、演出平平而已、潘債凱工程師明朗爽快、倒有很出色的表演、是一個可愛的丑角、南錫卡洛、節演一個虛榮嫉妒的女店員、這是她重回銀幕的第二次演作、成績還不錯、</p>
<p>皇后……我若為王</p>
<p>If　I　were　King</p>
<p>故事背景、是法王路易十一時代、在外有強敵內有飢民的巴黎、有一個一詩人而兼劍客的流氓（考爾門）在他暴亂羣眾之中做一個領袖人物、殺強敵、理朝政、憑着勇敢與才能所做的事蹟、</p>
<p>全片演出、偉麗堂皇、各人物也皆活躍有生氣、主要演員中如飭路易的Basll　Rothborn、是值得特別提出的、導演沒把本片處理得很嚴肅、全片到處盈溢着幽默的風味、這是成功的一點、再加上故事本身有動人的力量、劇情的熱鬧、演員演出之優秀、成功一部無可批評的作品、</p>
<p>平安……飛象過河</p>
<p>Arizoua　Mahoney</p>
<p>本片可以說是武俠片、也可說是笑片、但兩方面都平凡得利害、片以美國西部為背景、描寫一個女子、怎樣在無意中軟化了一羣盜匪、同時穿插着一個規模小得無可再小的馬戲班、和班主滑稽的演作、除一二鬥爭與詼諧等場面、稍能動人和令人發笑外、餘皆無甚可取、是派拉蒙公司一部很舊的出品、</p>
<p>東方……浪漫夫人</p>
<p>The　Divorce　of　Lady　X</p>
<p>英國亞歷山打柯達出品、故事寫一家倫敦的大飯店裏開宴會、恰遇迷天大霧、使一輩貴容不得回去、而就向飯店裏借房間、因人多房少、就有一位年輕的夫人、闖進一個單身男子的房裏、故事就這樣的展開、演出極為風趣、頗有美國風味、曼兒奧白朗演出恰到好處、男主角是英國明星、演出平平、</p>
<p>大華……驚鳳和鳴</p>
<p>Naugbty　Marictta</p>
<p>珍尼麥唐納和納爾達埃第早年的一張作品、但是卻不見得十分成功、歌曲也不似那時他們兩人的Rose　Marie　May　time兩片中的來得膾炙人口、然而這張片是曾得過獎章的、</p>
<p>新世界……摩登女招夫粵語片</p>
<p>就是舞上的「摩登女招夫」所改編、劇情是敘述一個家產百萬的宣翁、　吝異常、對於一切公益事業、非但一毛不拔、反要想法來佔人家便宜、這時因為各界發起籌款建立難民工業廠、想請他幫忙、可是結果他非但沒有拿出一點錢來、反而在會議席上、揩油了幾件西點、於是眾人設法想出這『摩登女招夫』的辦法來、想他來上當、再用女色來誘騙他、</p>
<p>主處是舞　紅伶、馬師曾譚蘭卿、也是該片家的生意眼</p>
<p>關於導演的手法還相當靈活</p>
<p>中央……胡惠乾打機房粵語片</p>
<p>為了「方世玉打擂台」一片的賣座成績特佳、聰明的製片商看准了生意眼、本片就是動機中產生的、</p>
<p>胡借乾軟弱不堪、被機房中人欺凌、胡惠乾為環境所迫、決定離開機房、赴少林寺學藝、以便將來報仇、經過了不少的困苦和危險、在某一天他果然回來、卒報父仇、本片劇情就是這樣簡單、導演無手法可言、鄺山笑改變作風飾胡惠專利、演來尙可、徐人心已久別銀壇、本片中馮婦再作、演出尙佳、全片佈景太簡單、機場打武亦不見緊張、</p>
<p>利舞台高陞同蝢…花木蘭粵語片</p>
<p>劇情描寫一個現代的女子、因為曾經演出過舞台上的「花木蘭」、因此她時時想做一做現代的「花木蘭」、果然在國難嚴重的時候、她實現了她的志願、原因是她發現了一個組織很有規律的漢奸機關、於是就和她的情人鄺山竹笑、共同設法破此秘密機關、盜取文件、不知道經了多少的困難、他們總於達到了目的、連伶俐志昏的漢奸們、也被他偉大的精神所感化、共同出發到前線去、</p>
<p>我們不否認這劇情在華南是較好的一部、但是還相當牽強、導演不能利用電影的技巧、鄺山笑陳雲裳之演技甚、</p>
<p>太平……粵劇</p>
<p>太平男婦女劇團</p>
<p>日　演……傾國桃花</p>
<p>夜演……寶鼎明珠二卷</p>

<p>— 賴端甫</p>
<p>前星期三日至昨日之一週內、我引為絕對可喜之消息、認為我國之毅然決然繼續加入本年之台維斯盃國際綱球比賽、與議決加入明年在芬蘭舉行之世界靈匹克運動大會、</p>
<p>日本好整以暇、早已作綱球界之積極訓練、備向台維斯盃賽一　之　、最近同盟社又故為宣傳、云將運大宗體育用具與在中國作戰之軍隊作　　、此皆勉強向外表示國內形勢不如外傳拮据之另一種手段、我國財政仍比日本豐裕多多、對於此種向外之表示、自不能稍為落後、其仍參加台盃、更決定參加侵略者所不能主辦又不能參加之柯靈匹克大會、實為當務之急、其謂不能有用之國　以作游戲之事者、不獨不明體育今對人類之重要、更不明國際大勢之所趨</p>
<p>「可以與可以無　、與傷　」臺盃雖不能不參加、但　派今在外最有成績而且已身在歐洲之許承基與蔡惠全外、如謂猶應在國內動國　派員以　、則非吾所敢贊同、蓋國內今無有國際水凖之綱球家也、然茍有熱中者、能助今港中之徐氏兄弟（煒培潤培）乘機赴歐一練見　、則是大住　、煒培一度赴歐歸來、即大見進步、潤培年僅廿　、未嘗見大　、藝已　布與　兄要拮抗、自是俱有綱球方才者、若得充份栽培、則三年內俱可獲國際　譽、殊有可能、關於栽培此二者之責、吾甚以為熱心富人如胡文虎先生者所宜為也、</p>
<p>對柯靈匹克大會議決選派較有希望之足球籃球隊、（按來屆世運已有取銷籃球消息、我何以忽決派籃球隊赴會、不知電訊有否誤報）可謂知所急　、前經前屆大會之教訓、已知此兩項在世界舞臺上仍未足稱　、則宜及早謀訓練之策、今者內地權烏蹤橫、雖僅屬騷擾性質、不足以損我軍事設施於分　、然於體育事業之集中訓練、殊有阻碍也、故意管見以為體委會應速設訓練股於香江、立委幹員、駐港選員作積極之訓練、如能及此作充份之籌備、則以今之新中國精神、一躍而得世界足球籃球冠軍榮銜、非奇事也、</p>
<p>今之體育界中人、每因過於重視錦標、遂不惜極種餌誘以羅致人才以為已用、馴至學校亦轎縱選手、忽視訓練後起之初階、與提倡體育之原旨相後甚遠、此我國體育久無進展之　結所在也、　界體育會委員鄧緝照君近倡取銷總錦標之　、藉重個人技能之　長、　目先遠大之有　人也、</p>
<p>華會對於本屆足球錦標之事、已極見搖　、人多惜之、我則以為事由自取、實不足惜、況不有打　、則沉沉暮氣者不足與　大刷新、是重大之　　正足助其收拾自　之心、力作中興之圖、未始非該會之福也、南華南之技藝、仍　各隊之冠、他日創　　起、吾敢決今港中仍無足與敵者、謂余不信、　拭目俟之、至於南華華、則前鋒之右內鋒左翼兩缺、非向乙丙組物色人才、勢必江河日下、內衛亦非藉錦標無望之此時訓練新人不為功、前衛則仍以用劉偉培林德譜謝錦洪三人為最宜矣、</p>
<p>前晚選出對菲之本港埠隊足球隊代表、未免太出人意外、因勉強錄用米杜息海軍與香港會各一人、遂不惜顛倒位置、自削抗戰能力、適足以形容非以藝選人而為感情用事、李天生宜左宜右、梁榮照對中衛三位置俱能應付裕如、則更易位置、雖不成問題、然既知用侯榕生於聯隊、則曷如用李當左內衛而侯　其左右之為愈、殆梁照榮移左、又曷如仍以梁當右前衛而以許竟成補左方一缺之為　、阜拉未嘗有右翼之演出而強以其充新缺、實難鋗割足適履之議矣、然而照最近之演出、如果論藝選人者、則正　隊必又成為中蒲聯隊、此則非有絕大體育精神不能致者、蓋如確根據最近之演出以選人、則兩隊必有下列之陣容也、</p>
<p>（埠際隊）</p>
<p>譚均幹</p>
<p>許竟成（東方隊）　候澄滔（東方會）</p>
<p>李天生（南華南）　告山奴（聖約瑟）</p>

<h3 id="c63">文藝陣綫 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 黄繩</p>
<p>「你能够加速那生命的跳動麽？你能够如他人所曾做過的一樣，把生命煽動起一種力量來麽？」高爾基的這一句話，可以作爲一般」鬥士」的警語，可以作爲那作爲「鬥士」之一的文藝工作者的座右銘，而借來對杳港文藝工作者說，尤其是最有音思和最有「警戒性」。</p>
<p>文藝是通過作主者覜把握和熔煉的現實的反映，嚴格地說，一篇文藝作品要是作者生命跳動了的結晶，經過了忍耐了　產陣痛之後，才生出來的產物，文藝工作者，作爲「鬥士」之一，以對於客觀現實的主觀反映，揚起一種改進社會的力量，主要是「幫助人類去明瞭他們自己，增加他們對於他們自己的信仰，而發展他們對於眞理的渴慕」（高爾基），他必須「加速那生命的跳動」。</p>
<p>抗戰使好些文藝工作者投身於新的鬥爭，文藝陣綫成爲交織於抗鬥營壘中的整個抗×陣綫的一個構成部分。新的鬥爭是一個熱烈的洪爐，那愈燒愈旺的火燄，那散着的時刻不同的星星，總之是那豐富的把握和熔煉的對象，豐富了文藝工作者的創作生活，使他們「能够加速那生命的跳動」，因而他們已「煽動起一種力量來」了，於是我們跟着把開首的高爾基的那句話，來徵求香港文藝工作者的答案。</p>
<p>香港文藝工作者實在不容易囘得出一個很好的答案，自然，他可以乾脆地勇敢地答過：「能够！」而且他無論如何也要這樣回答的，因爲「不問願意不願意，責任已落在我們的肩上了」；然而這回祗能當作他開步走時的一句豪語吧？</p>
<p>一年多來，香港的文藝園地也還是有點荒蕪的，不特荒蕪未闢，好些地方還蓬生着惑人的毒草，栽種和芟刈的工夫是要一齊下手了，香港，作爲文化動力的一個海外的大站，文藝陣綫的建立，不容許其遲遲。</p>
<p>自然·文藝工作者僻處在這孤島裏，受不到那愈燒愈旺的火燄的煎炙，也不容易親眼看到了散發着的時刻不同的星星；但現在也幷不是祗有寫戰鬥寫英雄的作品才得到重視，寫後方鬥爭和人物的也一樣可以得到高的評價。</p>
<p>也許有人覺得在這孤島裏住着，生活實在太平凡了，面對着這平凡的淫靡的社會，我們怎樣下筆呢？是的，沒有懷孕不出來孩子，懷了假胎祗能放出一股氣；但哥德吿訴我們說：「不要說現實缺乏詩趣；因爲詩人之所以爲詩人，就在他有天才能會把平凡的對象引到興趣這力面」這「才能」，其實也幷不是神秘奧妙的，不過是能够「看見發展」，「不看見發展的人，將永遠看不到眞實！因爲眞實幷不如其原狀，幷不停止推進。而是飛躍的：眞實是進展的，是矛盾的；是鬥爭的。」（盧那卡爾斯基）祗要能够看見「眞實」的發展，文藝工作者的創作便獲得源泉和機軸。「眞實是進展的，是矛盾的，是鬥爭的」，這决定僻處孤島的文藝工作者，也　能够加速那生命的跳動」，而「煽動起一種力量」。</p>
<p>一年多來，香港社會是向前躍進若，它居住着一百五十萬中國人，他成了中國的戰時的「特殊後方」，他從矛盾中發展着，在發展過程中不斷地表現着非常的事態，能够把搬這發展，創作便不或問題。一羣躍動着的浪花。這是現實發展的一個標記，這還不是寫作的現成題材嗎？這是一例，而且，香港變了落後分子的總匯，他們赤裸裸地肆無忌憚地，表現着他們的諸種相，難道我們不能就此創造一個和一個以上的刻劃的典型人物？</p>
<p>從這有來，香港的文藝者工作者應加緊已自的活動！應該把陣綫建立起來！</p>

<p>— 秋楊</p>
<p>—戰地雜記之一—</p>
<p>在灰色的占城外，楓葉染紅了山的半邊。</p>
<p>午後的秋陽，浴着遠近的山河原野，風蕭瑟地吹，帶來陣陣的血腥味，拂動熟透的高梁，拂着戰士們的單衣，使他們有點顫抖！</p>
<p>早就破壞了的公路，沒有行人，也沒有一條騾子和駱駝，只有一條的戰壕，跟公路成着直角，一直到那幾里外的山麓，用枯黄的樹葉，遮蔽着，外邊舖滿幾道鐵絲的電網。</p>
<p>四邊空氣，像很沈寂，只有懶散的鎗聲，辟卜地像元宵夜兒童玩弄的鞭炮，點綴這暫時沈寂的戰壕。</p>
<p>這是經過二晝夜的劇烈戰鬥以後，兩方傷亡都重，沒有死傷的人，疲倦得要死，都退囘各人的陣地，暫時停止了衝鋒和博鬥，弟兄們都蹲在壕裏，背脊靠着溼潤的壕裏的坭壁，槍桿倚在自己的身旁，合攏着撑不起的眼皮，嘴裏不住地打着呵欠。但大家都不敢睡着，提心吊胆的防×來襲。</p>
<p>特別好講的趙大嘴，又講着他自己如何勇敢的歷史了！難然講得驚險離奇而有點動人，但是囘答他的只有不經意的唯諾，有時甚至沒有人應他一句，可是他不管有人聽和沒有人聽，仍然繼續地講，白黏的唾味，掛滿在他的生滿在鬍子的嘴角，風塵瘦削的臉上，有着興奮的光彩，好像他講着勇敢殺×的歷史，而忘記了幾天沒有休息的疲勞，他講着講着，眞有點相類香港輪渡上賣一百病能治」的藥的人一樣，自言自笑。</p>
<p>趙爛嘴！安靜些吧！你的大砲比×人差得太遠了。</p>
<p>一句冷然的訕笑，又像不耐煩的聲調，在戰壕裏響起來，大家同樣的一笑，就連將要睡下的王鬍子，也嘻開了嘴。</p>
<p>「好—劉二毛子，你看，阿拉這一次不殺他十個八個，你來尋我開心好了」趙闊嘴更張開了大口，白唾沬四散的放射出來，還涉着他個人的一些羅曼史。</p>
<p>沈重的軋軋的馬達聲，在遠處響着，弟兄們都立了起來，探首向戰壕外面，就是趙闊嘴也停下了他的談鋒。說一聲，「橫豎是這一套」蹲下身子，握着他的槍管，沈默着。</p>
<p>三架塗着紅點的×機，在七百尺低空，漸來漸近了，馬達的聲響，震破了人們的耳鼓，空氣跟金屬撞擊的聲音，使人的心頭緊張的激動，弟兄們蹲下了身子，個個握住槍桿，鈎着檢機，張大血絲籠網着的眼睛，仰頭在樹枝空隙裏望着，忽的眼前一陣黑，滿天冲起黄色的塵土，碎石破鐵，四邊的飛迸着，弟兄們的耳朶，轟隆地聽不見什麽，只是匆急的呼吸裏，嗅到一些濃烈的硫磺味。</p>
<p>×機投彈後走了—塵土冲上天，被狂　的風吹散了—弟兄們的耳朶也瀕漸地回復了聽覺，但隨後又起的不是軋軋的馬達，而是猛烈的打過來的大砲，和機關槍，子彈劃過淸爽的畏空，戞然長嘯的飛過去。</p>
<p>上邊命令傳下了，說是「凖備衝擊一弟兄們個個又興奮起來，忘了剛才的疲倦。打緊脚腿，束緊子彈，揷上制刀，從戰壕裏等待衝鋒的命令。</p>
<p>「不中用的劉二毛子，看阿拉殺一打鬼子給你看！」趙闊嘴的口角邊白沬又多起來了，他—手抓若劉的衣服，一手握着鎗，嘴裏又滔滔地響了起來。</p>
<h3 id="c66">關於兒童讀物 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>目前關於兒童文化食糧方面，除了仍是呈現着嚴重的「讀物荒一的徵象外，還有幾項不應疏忽的事情，緊壓在兒童心靈上，像鐵閘般擋住了光明的一面，使他們被動的看難懂的無謂的書本，或是竟根本看不到書。</p>
<p>在一般表面新穎的家庭中，家長們把兒童當作大人一舷看待，給他們看的書非是名家的「傑作」，卽是國外的名着，好像非此不足使兒童得到上進，可是由此所促成的成績，却祇是將兄童驅人五里霧中，且連那脆弱的根基都弄糟了，我曾看到一位朋友硬逼着他十一歲的孩子鎭日價捧着吶喊徬徨」類的書死讀，不懂就責罰（我敢賭咒那位朋友自己却並沒讀過魯迅先生著作的一個字），所以那孩子老是哭喪着臉皺眉，別說意思深奧莫測，就連方塊字都認不全，至多他祗能吿訴你狂人日記中的瘋子瘋得「很有趣」，如此而已。</p>
<p>其次一種古色古香的人物，則是將兒童太看輕了，以爲小孩子家乳臭未乾，要看什麼小說「閒書」？課本唸熟就得啦，頂多在孩子無聊或是頑皮得以厲害時，才會找幾本西遊記，封神榜丟給他們，順帶着說：「別吵啦，看孫悟空姜太公鬥法吧，怪有趣的」，于是孩子果眞把思想沉浸在荒誕神奇的小說中，不知有漢，無論魏晉，像抽吸着鴉片一般。</p>
<p>冉有一些明達的家長，天天替孩子打算，跑書局翻書攤，忙個不了，然而所收穫的成績却異常可憐，國內文壇僅有的幾本如鏢，文件，稻草人，木偶奇遇記一類兒童優秀讀物，看完了時，便不得不退而求其次，『次』者旣竭，家長已心灰意懶，也覺得責任已盡，就索興不問『兒事』了，任憑孩子去到垃圾堆裏自己能揀出些什麽珍物來，就享受些什麼，所以在連環圓攤子旁我們也就大　發現這羣盲人騎瞎馬的孩子了。</p>
<p>至於貧苦兒童的敎養問題，因討論者甚多，此處暫略勿談。</p>
<p>歸納前述幾點，雖然都着重在兒童的缺乏正當合理的指導，但是兒童讀物荒的問題却是與之相互消長的，指導良好可减少讀物的反効應，讀物優良，自然也可吏指導者認識眞確易于從事，所以我們首先希望做家畏的改正自己歪曲的兒童觀念，把孩子當作蓄有兒童特性的人物着待，——就是說，他們祗能　讀兒童寫作的書文。和需要適當的指示，這責任應該由家長負起：復次，我們更希望文化工作人員多爲兒童們打算一下，抽出一些工夫，寫譯幾多活生生的鮮明美麗的讀物，當作抗戰禮物送給他們，不但替家長省去許多麻煩，就是將來這羣孩子長大了也會感激不盡的。</p>

<p>這兒發生了很不宰的現象，還未到河源—東江的第一個行中目的地，大部份同志都給病魔糾纏着了。在這艱苦的缺乏物質的隊伍裏，缺乏　藥，缺乏營養，是特別使病者加重痛苦的。在這階段裏，我們不但要負起反日責任，還要進行反病魔的鬥爭。結果，病魔雖然給我們趕出領土可是，我們的飯錢都給它吞滅了去，整隊的經濟，就在最困竭的階段裏，河源縣黄縣長給我們以絕大的愛護和帮助，使病同志能够入當地醫院留醫，同時更解决了我們部份同志的給養問題。</p>
<p>在河源，開始負起我們的工作重担，三分之一同志分發到各區自衛團去担任政訓工作。同時，河源城的十字街頭，出現了抗先的流動宣傳隊，出演着街頭劇，他們是形容枯槁而慘淡，唱着悲凉悽愴的流亡曲，引得旁觀者感動了，都以爲他們是眞的難民吧，於是很慷慨地把銅仙啦，紙幣啦，那拋到地上救濟難民。我們就將這些錢送到雉民收容所去。</p>
<p>三分之二的同志，繼續向東推進，到紫金的古竹壚，停留了十天，古竹，有着革命的傳統，過去有着偉大的鬥爭史，雖然空氣沉寂了許久，給我們一來，又逗起了他們像怒潮般的熱情了。</p>
<p>正在興頭地緊張地工作着的當兒，忽然情報傳來，說惠州收復了，這固然使我們喜躍，然而，在×人蹂躪過的惠州，是會怎樣的殘破和紛亂呵，是多麽需要人去工作呢；於是我們不能不離開那充滿了熱情的古竹靑年，向惠州推進。</p>
<p>的確，我們給他們的熱情絆住了，使我們無法忍心使他們就這樣閒散地放置着，决定留下五位同志繼續工作十天，增加了卅多位抗先新同志，成立了抗先紫金古竹壚部隊。</p>
<p>船是慢慢地駛着帆向東移動，岸上和船上的人互相響應着，別了，別了同志們，我們再見在前綫—歌聲震破朝晨的空氣，送別的人，一程又是一程，一里又是一里。這古竹靑年熱情的表示，與其說對我們，不如說他們是對國家民埃而發吧！</p>
<p>面對着×人鐵蹄踐踏過的惠州古城，已體無完膚了；橫貫着東江，交通縣城府城兩岸唯一的東新橋，已殘廢肢離，陷進在滾滾奔濤的東江去，這是×臨走時還留下的體物；繁盛的商業區！水東街，已成爲瓦礫場所；嬌媚的西子湖，已蒙上層灰的色紫，晚風吹來是腥臭的氣味，湖山失色了，西子的確羞見人。這被辱的一切一切，有着革命傳統的東江呵！幹嗎你不拿出一點本色來呢？西子呵，怎嗎你不發揮你的　氣而任殘暴的人類惡魔任意蹂躪呢？面對着被辱的西子湖，被殘殺的大量衆衆，被焚燬的建築物的殘骸，使他們焚起了撕毀人心的怒火！</p>
<p>趕走×人，還要收拾破山河，重新建設，我們是願意而且必需負起這艱鉅的任務的。現在同志們都散落到部隊云工作了。訓練靑年，發動民衆參加游擊戰，加强軍隊的政訓工作，這是我們做了還繼續做着的工作。敵人這次的退出惠州，顯然楚他兵力不够分配的表示，很可能他是會囘師反噬的，我們應該怎樣準備，加强民衆力量，揭露敵人的政治陰謀，待敵人回頭來就給它以迎頭的痛擊，東江是處在多麼重要的一個工作崗位呢。</p>
<p>過去三個多月的工作，抗先同志雖盡了自己的力量，然不能否認的，抗先是存在着許多弱點，尤其是幹部人材的缺乏，是開展工作困難的一個因素，希望而且熱誠地歡迎熱血的靑年，都參加到我們的隊伍來，共同負起和發展我們艱鉅的工作重担，更希望各地的工作同志，給我們工作上多多指示和帮忙，抗先是僻處在角落裏的一個小孩子，是多麼需要培植和引導啊！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Recognition of Anti-War Sentiment Among Japanese Soldiers <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on the 5th, over three thousand X army soldiers recently mutinied in Dagu. The reasons for this can be analyzed in two ways: first, the general Japanese soldiers have no intention of fighting and mostly hope to return to their hometowns as soon as possible; second, Japanese officers, catering to the wishes of the warmongering military, cleverly use deceptive tactics to achieve their dispatching purposes, thus arousing public anger. According to the dispatch, another noteworthy point is that the Japanese soldiers stationed in Dagu actually mistakenly believed that "the navy intended to provoke the army, opening fire and bombarding enemy ships...", which is quite interesting, revealing the internal disputes and disorder within the Japanese army. We must have a deep understanding of this major event of anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers, which will be of great help in determining our strategies for resistance. This is elaborated below:</p>
<p>(1) The anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers is a highly developed form of the Japanese people's anti-war movement. Since Japanese imperialism began its aggression against foreign countries, there has been anti-war sentiment among the Japanese people. The only difference lies in whether their arguments are based on moral or self-interest considerations. During the Russo-Japanese War, Kotoku Shusui and others launched an anti-war movement. Since the September 18th Incident, not only the general Japanese public has been weary of and opposed to war, but also the soldiers on expeditions have continuously staged mutinies and attempted anti-war actions. In Northeast China, a Japanese soldier secretly transported weapons, ammunition, and food to our anti-Japanese volunteer army, which was hailed as a beautiful story around the world. During the January 28th Incident, there was also an anti-war club organization among the Japanese soldiers in Shanghai. The significance of its widespread development deserves deeper attention. From a general perspective, the Japanese anti-war sentiment began with the general public. Therefore, shortly after the outbreak of this war of aggression against China, political prisons were thriving throughout Japan. In the first half-year alone, there were three or four major arrests nationwide, with a total of several thousand people arrested. The initial form was relatively open anti-war agitation, but it soon suffered the high pressure of the fascist government and became an undercurrent. Thus, it went from theory to action. However, the most powerful link in the anti-war movement is the anti-war sentiment of soldiers. The Sino-Japanese war of aggression has been prolonged and cannot be ended. Soldiers, having been away from their hometowns for a long time, become homesick, and most of the soldiers are poor workers and farmers who have no permanent property. They inevitably worry about the lives of their wives and children, causing the general Japanese soldiers to be eager to return home. In the Japanese army, there is even a ballad circulating, "If you don't die or get injured, you will never return home," the crisis of which can be imagined. When soldiers become tired of war and oppose it, and even participate in our resistance war, then the period of the Japanese X's disastrous defeat will arrive.</p>
<p>(2) The inevitability of the Japanese people's anti-war sentiment is something we should clearly recognize. Today, it is not all Japanese people who are invading China, but only the Japanese rulers, especially the military. What the Japanese people get is only pain, sacrifice, and increased oppression. A Japanese Esperantist openly admitted: "...In this war, the Japanese people get nothing but disasters...Therefore, most Japanese people will not support the war...I often hear that even ignorant farmers are cursing this war" (according to Ueda Shiro's "Crush the Deception of the Japanese Military!"). Most progressive and enlightened Japanese people understand that a war of aggression cannot relieve their suffering, but only increase the oppression they suffer. The Japanese rulers, especially the military, often deceive the Japanese people by saying, "If we 'conquer' China, the people's lives will be more comfortable." But the Japanese people's reply is: "During the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, wasn't the same preaching given to the people? Until now, although Japan has not fought a losing battle, after each war, they have never thought of improving the lives of the people. On the contrary, only the wealth of the capitalists has increased, and the autocracy of the military X has become stronger..." (according to "Stop the War of Aggression Against China!"). Although these are just a few words, they have fully stated the fact that the Japanese war of aggression is contrary to the interests of the people. Historical lessons are more powerful than anything else, so enlightened Japanese people almost unanimously advocate: "There is no enmity between the Chinese nation and the Japanese people, ×××××××××××××××××××". Even starting from their own interests, the Japanese people must oppose such a "groundless" and "harmful and unprofitable" war of aggression.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Japanese people's anti-war movement, although we have recognized its inevitability and seen some of its reality, we must accelerate this trend, turning inevitability into reality and making partial reality more widespread and universal. This depends on our subjective efforts. The specific methods are roughly as follows: (A) Expand propaganda to X. Let the Japanese people, who are deceived by the military X's fascist government, know the right and wrong, gains and losses of the war of aggression, and be sure to know the disastrous defeat in the war in China and the development of Japan's isolation; (B) Treat prisoners of war favorably and provide training to correct the bad influence of the militaristic education they have received for many years with facts, so that they know that the Chinese people are their good friends, and that their participation in the resistance war in China is no different from going to heaven; (C) We must also find ways to prevent the conspiracy and counter-propaganda of the × people, and break the anaesthetic theory and deception of the × people.</p>
<p>However, the most powerful factor in promoting the Japanese people's anti-war sentiment is a thorough resistance war, which is what the conscious Japanese people earnestly demand.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Along the Zengbo Provincial Road <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>—Return to Hui Travelogue Six—</p>
<p>1. A Record of Commander Chen</p>
<p>After inspecting Boluo City, we decided to advance along the Guanghui Highway to the front line of Zengcheng. Before departing, we revisited County Magistrate Huang and happened to meet him on the way, along with Mr. Chen Jie, the deputy commander of the Boluo Guerrilla Force. Deputy Commander Chen was also scheduled to inspect Hu and Futian that day, so the reporter was fortunate to accompany him, breaking much of the loneliness during the journey.</p>
<p>Leaving Boluo City, the sight of the devastated countryside was striking. Places like Sibao Water, West Bianyue... those closer to the city could not escape unscathed. However, when the × people burned our villages, they also suffered great casualties from our brave farmers, paying a high price.</p>
<p>Commander Chen Jie, who was traveling with us, explained everything patiently without showing any signs of fatigue. Mr. Chen can be called a vigorous old national hero. He is over sixty years old, with a three- or four-inch-long snow-white soft beard fluttering in the cold wind, showing such a heroic spirit. He speaks decisively, loudly, and passionately, with no signs of old age. Since the fall of Boluo until now, he has walked four or ninety miles almost every day, traveling to various districts under Boluo, directing and organizing strike teams, not being complacent or fearful. His image always gives us young people infinite encouragement, especially what he said, "People of our age are not far from death. Is it worth being complacent with this remaining life? What's the use of not taking it to kill the enemy?" These words show extraordinary insight. Cowards and defeatists should be excited when they hear this. Therefore, when it comes to the achievements of guerrilla warfare, Boluo is more heroic than Huiyang. Mr. Chen and County Magistrate Huang humbly said it was a matter of time and preparation. However, in the reporter's opinion, the "relationship between people" occupies a large position. The development of a guerrilla area requires not only brave cadres but also a brave commander.</p>
<p>2. A Tragedy of Compliant People</p>
<p>After we walked out of Tuanluo for more than seven miles, Commander Chen pointed to a village and sadly told the reporter a tragedy of compliant people. In that village below, the entire village of men, about a hundred people, mostly hid in the deep mountains when the × people occupied Boluo, leaving only seven or eight elderly and weak people. The seven or eight elderly and weak people were not the number that the × people wanted to kill. Therefore, during the first search, not only did they not harass them, but they also gave them military rice and biscuits, deceiving them into ordering all the men in the village to return home to receive compliant people's certificates and continue farming as usual. Four or five-tenths of them returned on the first day, and seven or eight-tenths on the second day. On the third day, seeing that there was no movement, they all returned. The × army, knowing that everyone had returned, immediately issued an order to have all the men in the village line up in the open space in front of the village to issue compliant people's certificates. When they were concentrated in the open space, they set up several machine guns and fired intensively. At most seven or eight people escaped, and the countless corpses were not yet buried. We are certainly angry at the × people's ×× methods, and at the same time, we also pity these foolish compatriots. If we had taken the lives of these sixty or seventy people to fight against the × people, how much precious value would we have exchanged for it? But they could not see clearly the × people's seemingly kind but ultimately fierce and gentle policy. No wonder Commander Chen sighed. It can be seen that in this era of rescuing the nation, overemphasizing one's own life will lose life, and attaching importance to the life of one's fellow countrymen will preserve it. Therefore, the reporter once again admired Commander Chen's insight.</p>
<p>3. The × People's "Bandit Area"</p>
<p>Xinzuotang is thirty miles away from Boluo, located at the intersection of the Guanghui Highway and the Guanghe Highway. Several sparse restaurants were completely destroyed, leaving only a few fortifications built by the × people. The bases of several guerrilla teams in Huzhen, Xiangshui, and Ping'anxu are all within a twenty-mile radius of Xinzuotang. It is certainly a hub for the × army's transportation and also a target for our local strike teams. The × people feel helpless about this area, so they call it the "bandit area." This is an honorable title.</p>
<p>In the villages in this area, the × people burned everything. The market town of Xiangshui originally had three hundred houses and shops. After the × people burned it four times, only one complete building remains. However, the Xiangshui Guerrilla Team, led by Battalion Commander Chen Shinan, also gave the × people the most attacks among the various guerrilla groups in Huibo. According to statistics, they launched no less than thirty or forty large and small attacks, constantly shooting and killing × soldiers and destroying bridges and roads, creating a new chapter in the history of guerrilla warfare. The houses in and near Xiangshui Market were not burned in vain. Many ashes have been stained with the dirty blood of many × people. Along the highway near Xinzuotang, I discovered many remains of × people's warhorses and many cremation pits where × people burned corpses. They are about two feet wide and more than four feet long, with soil mounds about five or six inches high padded at both ends. According to local people, they are used to support the head and feet of the corpses. Liquid chemical fuel is poured on them during cremation, and then dry firewood is laid on them for burning. Now, there is a lot of charred soil in the pits, and there are still one or two pieces of unburned bones, which is enough to show the large number of casualties of the × people in this area.</p>
<p>In order to prevent guerrilla attacks and sabotage, the × people have dispatched at least one squad of soldiers to guard the bridges along the Boluo section of the Hui-Guang Highway. The Xiangang Bridge has the most, exceeding three hundred people. Scattered trenches and machine gun positions are dug in front of and behind the bridge, as if facing a formidable enemy. At night, they often light gasoline lamps or burn rice straw, both to be vigilant and to boost their courage. However, although the × people are so well-prepared, the Xiangang Bridge has been destroyed twice by our guerrilla team. Later, they had nowhere to vent their frustration, so they wantonly showed their × nature and launched a large-scale burning and killing of neighboring Xiangang and Baguo and other villages. But after the burning and killing, the farmers who are the basic members of the guerrilla team have a deeper understanding of the true face of the × people and have become more active. Therefore, in the eyes of the × people, the guerrilla team has become a magical and elusive monster, posing a danger of being swallowed at any time, enough to cause them constant trouble and panic. Now that the × people have withdrawn, the self-defense corps has become stronger after training, and the anti-X sentiment is exceptionally high. It is a perfect trap for hunting × people.</p>
<p>4. Stroking the Remains of the Crashed × Aircraft</p>
<p>When our army retreated along the Chongguang Highway on October 16th last year, × aircraft flew low in groups, chasing and bombing. However, the "Eagle of the Sky," which the × people boasted about, was shot down by us and crashed in the Bawai Village not far from Xinzuotang. It is said that it was shot down by our self-defense corps with a 79 rifle.</p>
<p>The × people mostly used the power of the air force in this attack on South China. Therefore, before and after the fall of Huizhou, the × aircraft came very densely, and the strafing and bombing were also exceptionally low, only two or three hundred feet above the ground. Within this short distance, it is very easy to hit them by focusing fire with rifles. The battlefield and the highway are the areas where × aircraft fly low, and they are also the areas where rifles can exert their air defense effectiveness. Do not let Bawai and Wucun on the Hui-Zhang Highway be the only ones to do well (during the same period, Wucun also shot down one × aircraft).</p>
<p>Walking seven or eight hundred steps to the left of the Xiangruo Highway, entering Bawai Village, the wreckage of the aircraft is lying in the rice fields in front of the village.</p>
<p>The aircraft is a seaplane bomber, but after being burned and angrily torn apart by the villagers, most of the outer skin is incomplete. Only the characters "Showa" are left on the aircraft ×, which was probably manufactured in Showa 5th or 6th year. The engine, machine gun, and other parts inside the aircraft had already been stolen by the villagers and used as their weapons to "attack the shield of the enemy with his spear." There are three seats on the aircraft. According to the villagers, the three pilots were burned to death when it crashed. Their remains were collected and buried in the fields. Guided by the villagers, we went there to pay our respects. A mound of yellow earth rose up, becoming the "resting place of the imperial army. For the sake of the military X's titles, they finally buried their bones in the wilderness of the Central Plains. If they knew in the afterlife, how much sorrow would they have? However, even the four heavenly kings of the × people's proud air force have such an end. What about their poor ××?</p>
<p>Before leaving, the reporter took a photo of the empty iron frame of the × people's "Eagle of the Sky" and tore off the sun emblem on the aircraft as a souvenir.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Airmail] Mr. Ray Tillega, an American who sympathizes with and supports China's resistance war, recently came to Yunnan via Hong Kong and will go to Chongqing in the coming days to engage in relief work for our students. Because he had lived in Nanjing for a long time and witnessed the situation in Nanjing after its fall, the reporter specially went to visit him yesterday and was told the following in detail:</p>
<p>Ray Tillega said: The Japanese X's security in the Nanjing and Shanghai area is very strict. Any foreign national who wants to go to Nanjing is subjected to unwarranted entanglements by the Japanese X at the upper and lower military stations. The prosperous Nanjing has now become a dark hell, with murder and arson all being the masterpieces of the "Imperial Army." XX looting is especially the homework of the "Imperial Army." Outside Yuhuatai, at Yan Ruoshanjin, are the corpses of Chinese people who were brutally killed by the Japanese X. (The X people even use corpses as clothing buttons.) In front of the Confucius Temple, are the brothels and opium dens opened by the Japanese X. The income from these toxic places is the cost of the puppet government. The X soldiers in Nanjing are all like traitors and running dogs. They do not dare to walk alone. Every Chinese person's heart is always filled with memories of the Republic of China, and they secretly engage in the great work of killing X and saving the country. Even the police and gendarmerie of the pseudo-government are involved in assassinating traitors. All of this proves that the hearts of the Chinese people have not been conquered by the iron hooves of the Japanese X. He also said: The Japanese warlords now do not dare to let their ten soldiers stay in Nanjing for a long time, and they will be transferred after a few days. This is because of the increasing anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers. The Japanese puppets once forced Chinese and foreign teachers in Beijing to hold so-called "anti-Chiang" delusional movements, but all the teachers ignored them after repeated orders. The pseudo-government also wanted to allocate funds to jointly run refugee camps by Chinese and foreign teachers, but they were repeatedly rejected by the teachers. Mr. Qing Tillega concluded: "Because there are Chinese anti-Japanese guerrillas in the suburbs of Nanjing, and there are often assassinations of traitors in the urban area, the Japanese and X traitors are mostly panicked and cannot sleep peacefully!"</p>
<p>Mr. Ray Tillega is here on behalf of the American Youth Federation to engage in relief work for our students in China, carrying US$18,000 for relief purposes. The reporter immediately asked about the current situation of the American aid to China movement. He said: "American aid to China work can be said to be advancing day by day. Although I have not witnessed the situation of the US government lending to China, I predict that the aid to China movement will definitely increase further due to the government's active attitude. I am carrying this relief fund, which is purely the result of enthusiastic donations from American young students. The amount of relief funds for this year must be even greater, and what is even more exciting is that Japanese students in the United States are also actively participating in the work of opposing Japan's aggression against China. Although the Japanese consul has severely suppressed them, it is still ineffective. Regarding the movement to stop arms dealers from selling arms to Japan and boycotting Japanese goods, Americans are currently actively promoting them."</p>
<p>He also brought a large batch of medicines (weighing 2,000 kilograms) to Sichuan for the United Sichuan Hospital, which was purely donated by Americans. It is said that it has not yet been shipped due to customs barriers.</p>
<p>The reporter learned that he came to China via Japan and asked about the situation in X Country. He said: I stayed there for five days and saw that the economic strength of Japan had been exhausted. It can be asserted that its aggression against China is self-defeating and collapse is not far away. The biggest reason is nothing more than the unanimous boycott of Japanese goods by various countries, which has made its economic difficulties greater and it is no longer able to buy arms from abroad with large amounts of money as in the past. In order to restrict gasoline, each household of four is limited to sharing one car and cannot exceed the limited amount of gasoline. For all daily necessities, they try to replace them with other items. Tofu is used instead of eggs, and the lowest-quality local cloth is used to make kimonos. All commodity prices have increased by more than 30%. The people's anti-war sentiment has reached the highest level. The warlords use a policy of deceiving the people to deceive the masses. Since the war began, the number of soldiers who have died has reached more than 800,000. What they are propagating domestically is only more than 30,000. The general public hopes to end the war as soon as possible. However, the young soldiers are still tirelessly restless. Therefore, the anti-war atmosphere in the country is getting tighter day by day. Not only the people, but even the newspapers are promoting for China, arousing the people's anti-war sentiment. For example, after the fall of Yuehan in China last year, the newspaper once recorded that "Japan has conquered China." At the same time, it carried, "The Prime Minister summoned domestic arms manufacturers to rush to manufacture arms to meet this long-term resistance war." This is an example of the X people propagating for us. At this point in the conversation, it was already midnight, and the stars and moon were hazy. The reporter bid farewell to him.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Kunming Cultural Dynamics (3) <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>—Dream</p>
<p>Tongji University: During the "August 13 Incident" in Shanghai, this school struggled for a long time in the midst of artillery fire. It moved from Shanghai to Jinhua, then to Ganzhou, then to Babu. Now it has moved from Babu to Kunming. Their new campus has been found near Kunming.</p>
<p>Some of the students who came to Kunming from Babu traveled by sea, while others traveled on foot. These students who came to Kunming on foot did not do so entirely because of financial difficulties. The main reason was that they were unwilling to detour to the foreign territory of Hanoi and were willing to endure the hardship of walking. This is the "practical and realistic" school spirit of Tongji University.</p>
<p>Zhongzheng Medical College: Originally located in the suburbs of Nanchang, Jiangxi. Part of the new campus had been built when the war of resistance began. Nanchang became the target of × aircraft bombing. For safety reasons, it moved remotely to Liuzhou for classes. Recently, it moved from Liuzhou to Kunming and is currently building a campus near Bailongtan in Kunming. After a month, it can move to the [unclear] campus to study.</p>
<p>More than 100 students have arrived in Kunming. They temporarily borrowed the YMCA for classes on the 20th and 23rd of this month. This is a public medical college. The students are willing to endure hardship, and there is a spirit of mutual assistance and love among the students.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen University: Fled from the artillery fire in Guangzhou. Guangzhou fell on December 28. A part of the administrators and a part of the instruments and books of Sun Yat-sen University left Guangzhou on the 27th. Their losses were only a part of the instruments and books of the Medical College and the Engineering College. The others had already been moved out of Guangzhou. Most of the students are in Hong Kong, and they have been coming to Kunming one after another recently. Their campus has been found in Zhengjiang, 100 kilometers away from Kunming.</p>
<p>What Sun Yat-sen University regretted when it moved out of Guangzhou was that the newly built campus, worth more than 10 million yuan, fell into the hands of the × troops relatively intact. Speaking of this, we cannot help but feel particularly heartbroken.</p>
<p>Before the five major [colleges] mentioned above, Kunming's highest institution of learning was Yunnan University. It is located in the culturally backward southwest, and everything is of course unable to develop. Therefore, the students at Yunnan University in the past were of a relatively low level. In the Chinese interior, where transportation is inconvenient, education is indeed greatly affected.</p>
<p>Last summer vacation, Yunnan University was changed to a national university. The Ministry of Education appointed Xiong Yan to preside over the school affairs. Mr. Xiong has been in the education field for many years. This time, he returned to his hometown to serve and did his best to reorganize and revitalize the university. In a very short period of time, the situation of the school was not as it was before. Famous professors were hired, and the level of the students was raised. Under Mr. Xiong's strict [unclear], the students gradually developed a style of studying. This is one of the points worthy of attention in the progress of Southwest culture.</p>
<p>(3) Cultural Figures</p>
<p>The cultural figures in Kunming now include Shen Congwen, Zhu Ziqing, Gu Jiegang, Mu Mutian, and Xie Bingxin. Not long ago, Shen Congwen wrote several articles for the New Trends Bi-Monthly, including an article entitled "To Young Friends," which was written out of dissatisfaction with the student summer training. He spoke very sadly, but his articles have rarely been seen recently. Zhu Ziqing and Mu Mutian are the directors of the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese Literary and Art Circles Anti-× Association. Mu Mutian often writes articles for Yunnan's [unclear] products and is greatly respected by many young people. Gu Jiegang teaches at Yunnan University. He is the chief editor of the "Frontier" of the Yishi Daily. Xie Bingxin has arrived in Kunming, but I have not seen her articles. She does not often attend literary and art groups. She is probably writing a new work [unclear].</p>
<p>Not long ago, Mao Dun and Wang Lisxi arrived in Kunming. The Cultural Association specially invited them to a tea party at the People's Education Hall. Zhu Ziqing was also present. The place was packed, a grand occasion in Kunming's cultural circles. Wang Lisxi spoke about the current situation of international aid to China. Recently, the Yunnan Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League was established. The cultural circles of Yunnan have received much encouragement from them.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, our country's authorities have issued various public bonds to cope with all wartime expenditures. The bonds issued since the War of Resistance include National Salvation Bonds worth 500 million yuan, National Defense Bonds worth 500 million yuan, and three types of Gold Bonds, totaling approximately 550 million yuan in national currency. Relief Bonds worth 100 million yuan, totaling 1.65 billion yuan. On the other hand, Japan has issued public bonds worth more than 6.88 billion yuan since the outbreak of the war. Comparing the two, we are only one-fifth of Japan. The disparity in the burden per capita is even greater. Judging from the financial resources, it is even clearer which of our × countries can support the long-term War of Resistance. Recently, according to banking circles, our country's War of Resistance has entered a new stage. In addition to coping with the war, we are also working hard on the construction of the west as a basis for supporting the long-term War of Resistance. Our government is actively promoting this, and overseas Chinese investors are particularly enthusiastic. Therefore, the current promotion has achieved considerable results. However, this kind of work is complicated and requires a lot of money. The Central Ministry of Economic Affairs is planning to issue National Reconstruction Bonds worth 500 million yuan for this purpose. This debt is specifically used to develop the rich resources of the southwest, northwest, and border areas. It is heard that the issuance regulations have been drafted, and they can be officially announced and implemented after they are approved. The reporter believes that this news is of great concern to Hong Kong overseas Chinese. If it is true, it will not only absorb social idle funds and give the people an opportunity to save the country, but also the plan to develop the rich resources of the west will be promoted more smoothly. Therefore, he specially visited various parties to inquire about everything. Relevant parties have also heard about this matter, but have not been able to verify it. According to Sir Zhou Shuchen, a gentleman of the Hong Kong National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee, the Hong Kong has not yet received a formal notice regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' issuance of National Reconstruction Bonds. It is also expected that our country's government has such a plan. Therefore, this debt is entirely used for national construction, and its importance is not less than that of war expenses. As for the promotion of National Salvation Bonds in Hong Kong, the situation is also very optimistic. At the beginning of the Guangdong War, although the war affected people's hearts and was slightly hit, the war is now gradually stabilizing, and we have grasped a favorable position, so the debt sales have also returned to their old appearance. Currently, monthly sales are about 100,000 yuan. Although the number is not large, it can be said that it has achieved considerable results. (Jun Ren)</p>

<p>[Associated Press Chongqing, 6th] Foreign church authorities in Guiyang telegraphed Chongqing, reporting on the bombing of Guiyang last Saturday. All foreigners are safe, [but] the commercial area was completely destroyed. Regarding the bombing of Wanxian by aircraft on Saturday and Sunday, official reports confirmed that the French Catholic Church there had been destroyed. It is believed that all foreigners are safe and sound. Japanese aircraft also destroyed the Islamic Mosque, as well as two newspapers and two banks. A fire broke out, burning fiercely, and was extinguished only yesterday afternoon. It is estimated that more than 1,000 people were killed or injured in the bombing of Wanxian.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Chongqing, 7th] Official observers here believe that the Japanese side may apply the same [unclear] behavior of indiscriminate bombing of Guiyang and Wanxian to Chongqing. Therefore, they ordered residents to evacuate. The police are assisting residents and shops in storing large quantities of sandbags in preparation for extinguishing fires. Shelters have been built in open spaces and private gardens. The population of Chongqing has decreased from 600,000 to 300,000. In addition, many people hide in the mountains every morning and return to the city at night. However, officials and military personnel take it lightly, because they have long been accustomed to it on the front lines of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>If inspecting the front lines requires long-distance travel by car, I'm not afraid of aircraft "visits", but I am afraid of the car breaking down midway—the car I took this time to go north was "a thing of old age serving the public." Upon seeing it, I was a little uneasy. Unexpectedly, just near the Xiangtan Station of the Xiang-Qian Railway, it suddenly let out a sigh, followed by a few shudders, and stopped, declaring: "Exhausted and retiring!" Its attendant official—the mechanic—tried all kinds of remedies without success and asked me to appeal to the Hengyang Power Plant for help. As a result, on the third day, an "ambulance" came from Hengyang to tow it back for repair. Therefore, I had to plan to start acting alone, using guerrilla tactics, first crossing the river to Xiangtan, then taking the Xiang-Qian train to Zhuzhou, then transferring to the Yue-Han Railway to go north, to Changsha, to Miluo, to... Matters concerning "guerrilla secrets," please forgive me for not pre-issuing the check.</p>
<p>Almost destroyed by fire and becoming "Changsha's Scorched Earth Second," Xiangtan, viewed from the highway across the Xiang River, looks like a tall, slender lover of the Xiang River, lying close to the left side of the Xiang River. It is so slender that you can't see the feet when you see the head. Therefore, Changsha people like to use her long shape to compare with the neighboring Changsha's blocky city scene, calling it "Changsha is a piece, Xiangtan is a line."</p>
<p>The ferry is downstream of the newly built bridge piers of the Xiang-Qian Railway, but when rowing the ferry, it is still necessary to cross diagonally against the current under the bridge. The bridge piers are about seventy to eighty feet high, half submerged in the water and half exposed above the surface, standing majestically on the river, like a row of tall and brand-new pagodas, very spectacular whether viewed from afar or near. Unfortunately, due to the impact of the enemy's invasion, construction has to be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>After landing and entering the city, it took a very, very long walk to reach the main street of the bustling area. The city's main streets consist of only three, all running parallel to the Xiang River, forming the shape of the Chinese character "川" (river): the one closest to the riverbank is called "River Street," the middle one is called "Main Street," and the remaining one is called "Back Street." Business is relatively quiet on Back Street and River Street, while Main Street is very lively. Businesses such as silk and satin, cloth, department stores, and hotels and restaurants are mostly located on Main Street, lined up for business. At that time, it was already late, the electric lights had just come on, and the pedestrians were still very crowded. The business at the stores was also extremely lively. Originally, Xiangtan was a wharf on the Xiang River, and recently it has become a disguised loading and unloading station at the eastern end of the Xiang-Qian Railway (the railway was originally open to traffic to Zhuzhou, connecting with the Yue-Han and Zhe-Gan Railways, but because the "Xiang River Railway Bridge" was suspended, Xiangtan became a loading and unloading station). It is known that "the spirit of the place" will surely help it gradually move towards prosperity. However, the reason why it has suddenly gained a distorted prosperity, such as the sharp increase in store business revenue, the full occupancy of hotels and restaurants, and the ability of porters and coolies to earn more money, are all phenomena that suddenly occurred after the Changsha fire. In other words: Xiangtan's current distorted prosperity is indeed due to the Changsha fire, with "people" and "wealth" scattered everywhere, and Xiangtan, being close to the water, absorbed a large amount, thus making a windfall.</p>
<p>However, although Xiangtan was lucky enough to make a windfall from the Changsha fire, it was almost caught in the "fishpond disaster" of the Changsha fire, turning into nothing in a burst of fierce fire and thick smoke!</p>
<p>During the Changsha fire, Xiangtan, being close to the area, was flooded with wounded soldiers and refugees. Among them, some so-called "arson squads" also arrived one after another. Upon meeting with the county government, they immediately dispersed to the houses on each side street, setting up ladders and fire-starting tools, preparing to carry out a bamboo-like arson on the three "川"-shaped bustling streets!</p>
<p>They—the arson squad—moved skillfully and spoke passionately. The citizens who had not been evacuated or escaped did not dare to interfere with them. That kind of crisis, sharp to the extreme, was very much like the Three Kingdoms era when Wu general Zhou Yu was preparing to burn Cao's troops at the Battle of Red Cliffs. The reason for the moment before the fire was set was simply: "Everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking!"</p>
<p>This time, the east wind that Xiangtan was blowing when the fire was about to be set was also controlled by one person, like Kong Ming. So, the difference is that Kong Ming's east wind had to be borrowed through magic, but this person's east wind was genuine and contained in his mouth. As long as he was willing to spit it out, he would surely send Xiangtan into a sea of ​​fire, burning it to "Changsha's Scorched Earth Second" in a burst of crackling and peeling! However, he had unique insights and believed that there was no need to spit it out. Thus, Xiangtan, sitting on the crater, was finally rescued by him.</p>
<p>"Changsha's Scorched Earth Second!" This was originally a somewhat煽惑性glorious term. When the Changsha fire itself was still under debate. It is said that the former county magistrate, Mr. ×, seeing that the situation at the front was unclear, also asked that person to agree to Xiangtan emulating Changsha and quickly implementing scorched earth, with the reason of "heroic sacrifice." Otherwise, it would be too late. That person replied, "I have a duty to defend this land here. I have not been ordered to retreat, nor have I seen the × being defeated. Even a blade of grass must be protected with all my strength. How can I not ascertain the truth and set fire to a city where the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people are entrusted? However, if you really want to make a heroic sacrifice, it is advisable to postpone it for three days before making a decision." However, in fact, by the next day, the mistake of the Changsha fire was revealed to the world. The arson squad waiting for the "east wind" in Xiangtan was disarmed and sent away with foreign money. The citizens of Xiangtan all returned home, seeing their houses intact, and their chickens and dogs unharmed. Later, after learning the truth, they were deeply grateful in their hearts and offered 20,000 yuan in gold and a specially made brocade banner with the words "Living Buddha of Ten Thousand Families!" to respectfully thank that person. That person declined the money but accepted the banner. He was then ordered to lead his troops to other places. Upon arriving at the destination, he remitted the money back in full.</p>
<p>Who is that person? Even I have never met him, because he had left more than a month before I arrived here. However, from the tone of the person who told me this story, I heard that he was a division commander named Du. There is also a highway from the city to the bus station, which he also advocated and built with military labor. The citizens carved a stone to name it "Yugong Road" to show their gratitude. The words "Du Yugong" are not his name, but surely his alias.</p>
<p>Although this touching story happened two months ago, at that time, everyone's attention was focused on the unprecedented Changsha fire. At the same time, Xiangtan was located in the rear, and this crisis of almost becoming "Changsha Second" was subtly resolved invisibly—so the great process of this story is still little known to the outside world. However, I am happy to record it, and the significance is not simply to value the news value of the story itself, nor is it to promote the hidden virtues of the people in the story, but to use this to arouse everyone's research and understanding of other important issues related to this story.</p>
<p>First, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, our highest leader revealed the main points, saying: "The foundation of victory in the War of Resistance in the future lies entirely in our ability to fight independently... independently and autonomously." From the story of Xiangtan's "turning danger into safety," it proves that among our general defending the land, there is no lack of people who can have the spirit of "independent autonomy" with initiative, awareness, and responsibility. This is one of the conditions for laying the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>Second, our highest leader also said: "We must not make unnecessary sacrifices in order to accomplish tasks." This of course includes manpower and materials. Xiangtan's not hastily implementing scorched earth in the name of sacrifice, and finally completing the task of defending the land, is one of the expressions of the progress of the main spirit of the Second War of Resistance. It is also the second condition for laying the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>Third, the troops stationed in Xiangtan can do their best to protect the property of the local people, and the people can also sincerely express their respect and love to the army. This is the ironclad proof that the army and the people are truly united and resisting the war with one heart, and it is also the third condition for laying the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>Fourth, the ongoing work of resistance is a great opportunity for the sons and daughters of China to be born in an era where "times create heroes" and "heroes create situations." It is easy to establish extraordinary achievements by bravely killing the enemy at the front lines, and it is also possible to establish great merits by relying on one's conscience and using all one's intelligence in the rear, like General Du's effort to avert the disaster in Lake Xiangtan. A good opportunity for the ages is hard to come by again, compatriots, encourage each other!</p>
<p>Fifth, the all-out war of resistance covers more than ten provinces, and the front lines extend for thousands of miles. Among the tens of millions of soldiers and civilians active in the front and rear, there must be many who have the outstanding deliberation and determination of General Du. There must also be many who unintentionally create achievements like the "Living Buddha of Ten Thousand Families" in Xiangtan. This is a great manifestation of the spirit of our nation's resistance to the war, and it is also a valuable page in the history of our nation's success in the war of resistance. We should not let it be self-generated and self-destructed, and we should collect and preserve it.</p>

<h3 id="e19">British Undersecretary Answers Member Questions: Considering Economic Aid to China, Demanding Japanese Compensation for British Losses, Silence on Closing the Yangtze Cannot Be Tolerated <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] British Undersecretary Butler, in the House of Commons yesterday answering questions from Sir Gasa, stated that the government has received 300 claims for compensation from British merchants in China, totaling £230,000, all caused by direct destruction, confiscation, looting, or damage by the Japanese army in China. The government has forwarded these claims to the Japanese side. Such claims for compensation are usually cleared and settled after the end of the war. A member asked whether it was true that Japan had announced that it would not compensate for the loss of foreign property. The Undersecretary replied, "I cannot accept such a broad statement." Mr. Marston then asked under what international law Japan was prohibiting British ships from sailing on the Pearl River. The Undersecretary replied that Japan claimed that the movement of third-country ships would hinder the Japanese military operations currently underway on the Pearl River. Mr. Henderson asked if the Chinese government had requested assistance and what the government's response was. The Undersecretary replied that some suggestions from China for economic assistance were being considered, but it was not convenient to provide any detailed reports at this time. Mr. Marston then asked whether he had received a statement from the Japanese government regarding the opening of the Yangtze River. The Undersecretary replied that he had not received any further statements from the Japanese side since November 14 last year, and that further evidence regarding Japanese trade on the Yangtze had been submitted to the Japanese Foreign Ministry by the British Ambassador to Japan on the 13th of this month. Labour MP Alexander then asked, "Is the government willing to remain silent on the Japanese government's policy of stopping British ships from sailing in China?" The Undersecretary replied "No." Peter MacDonald asked whether the government of Burma had supported the improvement of the Burma Road to Yunnan and whether the government would thoroughly improve the road to modern standards in order to develop this trade route to the Far East. Mr. Moorehead replied on behalf of the government that the government of Burma had made the 120-mile road from Lashio to the Chinese border passable in all seasons and would continue to improve other sections of the road. Mr. Morgan then asked what steps the Prime Minister would take regarding the fact that the Japanese authorities in Qingdao were preventing foreign improvements and the export of goods financed by the Bank of China in Chinese currency, and whether this "prohibition" had been extended to other ports. The Undersecretary replied that in recent months, the Japanese authorities in Qingdao had often refused to issue export permits, sometimes citing the reasons given by Mr. Morton, and sometimes failing to explain the reasons. The British Consul in Qingdao has repeatedly protested to the Japanese Consul there, but the Japanese Consul has argued that "necessity requires the issuance of export permits." The Undersecretary also said that the Japanese authorities have recently extended the system of "military necessity requiring the issuance of export permits" to Weihaiwei and Yantai, and the government is paying close attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Chamberlain's Speech: Close Ties Between Britain and France; France Attaches Great Importance to German Silence; Italian Political Circles Feel Uneasy <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 7th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, in the House of Commons tomorrow, will answer questions from members regarding French Foreign Minister Bonnet's recent statement in Congress that when Britain and France are drawn into war, the troops of the two countries will be dispatched by one country, saying that this statement is fully in line with the agreements made by the British government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons regarding Anglo-French relations is considered extremely important by French political circles, as the speech clearly shows the inseparable and close ties between the two democratic countries of Britain and France. Chamberlain's guarantee implies that Britain and France are not very concerned about Franco-Italian relations, but only indicate that if Germany attacks France, Britain will definitely help France. This point is considered to be of particular significance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] The discussion here on Chamberlain's remarks remains silent. A spokesman told our reporter that Prime Minister Chamberlain's guarantee to France is not a new fact, and that a similar guarantee was made during the previous Czech crisis. The future development of the situation depends on whether Chamberlain's remarks will strengthen France's attitude. If France's attitude is strengthened as a result, it will make the current situation even more tense, and the consequences will be dire. One commentator said that Chamberlain's guarantee is not much different from Germany's guarantee to Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 6th] Prime Minister Chamberlain's guarantee to France has made Italian political figures greatly nervous. They believe that this shows that Britain and France have the same interests, and that it is more frank and accurate than Chamberlain's previous statements. One side said that Chamberlain's guarantee is equivalent to a military alliance, and its binding effect is no less than the German-Italian relationship declared by Hitler. Some political observers believe that this statement has shattered Italy's belief that Britain has not provided France with military assistance. Italy has always believed that French Prime Minister Daladier has been seeking this guarantee since the Munich Agreement, but has been rejected by Chamberlain. Now it shows that Daladier has had his wish fulfilled. Officials do not comment on this, but say that Italy's natural aspirations will not endanger the important interests of any country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 6th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the country's House of Commons today, making a statement on the ties between Britain and France. Afterwards, Fascist Party members here all expressed disappointment, saying that this speech almost declared that Britain and France had concluded a treaty of alliance to deal with the totalitarian countries.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Palestine Conference Opens in London Yesterday; British Prime Minister Addresses Arab and Jewish Representatives Separately; Resolving to Mediate Disputes with Peaceful Policies <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Today's opening ceremony of the Palestine Conference at St. James's Palace here was held in two ceremonies. The Prime Minister first addressed the Palestinian Arabs and representatives of their countries, and then addressed the Jewish representatives. This is because the Arabs do not recognize the Jewish delegation. The Prime Minister addressed the Arabs, saying, "My policy is peace. You should know that my method of seeking peace is mediation, and the first step in mediation is contact. When disputes arise between the peoples of two countries, only the strength of politicians can complete a compromise based on justice. Before us now, there is a task that needs to be worked on. The matter is undoubtedly difficult, but it is by no means beyond our reach." The Arab delegation, including representatives from the Mufti Party and countries near Palestine, was welcomed by the Prime Minister into the famous Queen Anne Painting Room and began talks in front of the Carra painting. This is truly an unprecedented meeting. Officials made every effort to isolate the two sides, and the Jewish delegation was welcomed later into the banquet hall on the other side of the Carra statue, because the Arabs refused to sit in the same place as the Jews.</p>
<p>Four Opinions of the Arab Delegation</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The High Committee of the Arab delegation is currently busy preparing a report to submit the Arab side's views to the Palestine Conference. The opinions include: (1) Recognition of the complete independence of Palestine; (2) Concluding a treaty to replace the mandate; (3) Abolishing the Balfour Declaration; (4) Immediately stopping Jewish immigration and land sales. The Committee has received many telegrams from groups in Egypt and Palestine, two of which specifically point out that the representatives of the National Defense Party can only represent the party, and the High Committee should represent Palestine. These telegrams have tended to strengthen the attitude of the Islamic leaders' faction towards the National Defense Party's faction. The reconciliation of these two Arab delegations may not be achieved in the short term. Today, the Indian Muslim League issued a declaration of sympathy for the Arab demand for independence through its London representative. British Minister for Indian Affairs, the Marquess of Zetland, received a copy of the declaration and promised to forward it to the British government. Nashashibi, the leader of the Arab National Defence Party delegation, told a Reuters reporter: "I feel deeply that the British government truly desires to reach a solution to establish peace in Palestine. The National Defence Party will accept any proposal that will enable Palestine to become independent. Our delegation is determined to work for the justice of the country. No personal ambition, regardless of the outcome. The National Defence Party is willing to cooperate fully with the Mandate government to solve this problem."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The Arab National Defense Party delegation arrived at Waterloo Station here yesterday, and Colonial Secretary MacDonald welcomed them.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 6th] The local police discovered several rioters hiding in the village of Seouri last night. A struggle ensued, killing two armed Arabs and arresting seven, and seizing a large number of arms and weapons.</p>
<h3 id="e22">After the Soviet-Hungarian Breakup, Hungarian Interests Entrusted to Japanese Embassy <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 6th] After the Soviet-Hungarian breakup, the Hungarian embassy staff have been ordered to return home, and the interests of the country's overseas Chinese have been entrusted to the Japanese embassy for care. Hungarian Minister Dr. Jungert also asked the Japanese embassy to handle the closing affairs of the Hungarian embassy before leaving. The Japanese embassy recently announced that it will temporarily take care of the interests of Hungarian expatriates until the diplomatic representative of a third country officially accepts the Hungarian entrustment. Most foreign diplomatic representatives regard this matter as difficult. Since Poland and Hungary maintain friendly relations, they could originally accept the Hungarian entrustment, but relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have recently improved greatly, and the two sides are in negotiations to plan to sign a commercial agreement. Under these circumstances, Poland is naturally unwilling to offend the Soviet Union by taking care of the interests of Hungarian expats.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Britain and France are Cooperating Closely, Will Try to Mediate the Spanish War; Spanish Government Troops Continue to Enter French Territory; Temporary Meeting Decides to Retreat with All Troops <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The previous Anglo-French plan to mediate a ceasefire in Spain, having been rejected by both sides, has been declared a failure. Now that Franco has demanded the unconditional surrender of the Spanish government, government officials have different opinions. The Spanish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister plan to send three conditions to Franco: (1) Withdraw foreign volunteers; (2) Hold a referendum to listen to public opinion and decide what kind of government Spain should establish in the future; (3) The two sides will not take retaliatory actions in the future. The Spanish President, however, advocates unconditional surrender to avoid war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] It is reported that the Spanish government has asked the British government to mediate the Spanish civil war. The British side has not yet raised the matter with Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army. The National Army has expressed its rejection of mediation. The British government is now cooperating closely with France to find ways to end unnecessary bloodshed in Spain, but it is not known what steps the two countries will take.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 6th] Regarding whether the Spanish civil war can be ended, the British government authorities probed the opinion of the Duke of Alba, the informal representative of the National Army government in London, this morning. National Army figures here commented that General Franco will definitely demand the unconditional surrender of the government troops, and that those who have never committed crimes after the end of the war may be granted a death.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] The French Foreign Ministry announced that if Spanish Government Prime Minister Negrín does not immediately go to Valencia to preside over everything, the French government will consider the Spanish Republican government "to have temporarily ceased to exist."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 6th] According to news received here, Spanish Republican President Azaña arrived at Sarges, 20 kilometers south of Geneva, at 6 p.m. today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] The local press tried all day to find out the whereabouts of the Spanish government officials. By nightfall, they had mostly been confirmed. President Azaña is in the Alpine resort of Aelper, and Prime Minister Negrín is in a temporary frontline in Tairee. Other cabinet members are scattered in Paris and Panbyinan. Negrín and some cabinet members are determined to continue their resistance and have decided to go to Figueras to attend a parliamentary meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Aquilana, Northern Spain, 6th] After the President of the Republic went to France, Prime Minister Negrín, with most of the cabinet members, withdrew from the city of Figueras on the evening of the 4th. The next day, they held a meeting a few kilometers from this town (that is, 15 kilometers from the French border) and decided to take all necessary measures to order the government troops to retreat completely, and designated several teams to go to the central region. In the future, the Republican government will choose one of Valencia, Murcia, and Cartagena as the temporary capital.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] Thousands of French troops have arrived at the border to strengthen defenses, preparing to deal with and dispose of Spanish government troops retreating into French territory. The French government said that key Spanish government officials cannot engage in any activities after retreating into French territory, so as not to affect France's neutral status. France's accommodation of refugees and retreating troops is purely on humanitarian grounds. According to the situation in all directions, the government troops are willing to make peace, only awaiting appropriate conditions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Pau-Guten, 7th] The Spanish government troops and baggage in Prugsada began to retreat at 11:30 last night. Dozens of heavy artillery were first transported by trucks across the border highway into French territory, non-stop throughout the night. All were disarmed after entering the country. It is not yet known whether the infantry will continue to retreat to France.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Perpignan, 6th] After the defeat of the Spanish government troops in Catalonia, a large number of troops retreated to the French border, and key government officials also fled to France. Government aircraft also landed at French airfields. According to reports, the government troops are now seeking peace to end the war, but the rebels can only accept the unconditional surrender of the government troops. Thousands of French troops are now concentrated on the border, preparing to drive out any intrusions by the Spanish rebels. Spanish Foreign Minister Tarvaillo is consulting with foreign ambassadors, and it is said that he has asked French Ambassador Henri to mediate the war, but Henri denied this. It is also said that Spanish President Azaña intends to hold peace talks in Paris.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The "Daily Mail" commented on the Spanish war today, saying, "The Spanish war has reached its final stage. If peace cannot be negotiated at this time, it will cause an even more cruel tragedy." Spanish President Azaña and Prime Minister Negrín are aware that the government troops can no longer continue "the war, and future wars will have cruel consequences."</p>

<p>[TASS Moscow, 7th] Pravda recently published an article titled "The New China Is Growing Stronger": The article states that Japan's last attempt to defeat the main force of the Chinese army on the Wuhan line has completely failed. China's resistance against foreign bandits and its fight for freedom has entered its second stage. During this time, China's military strength has greatly increased, and the combat capability of Chinese soldiers has increased many times over. The battle line has been extended by more than four thousand miles, making any offensive by the Japanese extremely difficult. The Japanese soldiers have reached mountainous areas, and the possibility of joint operations has been completely lost. The Chinese army is preparing for a decisive counteroffensive, backed by the rapidly developing economic foundations of the western and southwestern provinces. The unity of the Chinese army and the people is also becoming increasingly consolidated, and the long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is extremely firm. The expulsion of Wang Jingwei from the Kuomintang has been approved by all the Chinese people, which demonstrates the determination of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to eliminate internal reactionaries.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Senator Pittman stated that the President's policy of aiding democratic countries and selling aircraft to France should be made public immediately.

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] It is learned that when Dr. Funk, the Minister of Economic Affairs, took office as the head of the German National Bank, he was advised to maintain the stability of wages, prices, and currency, and to avoid the tax increases advocated by Dr. Schacht. The economic theory of the National Socialist Party also does not allow currency inflation but believes that the increase in the amount of paper money in circulation, along with the increase in goods production, is not inflation. Dr. Funk believes that the National Socialist Party's financial management is not a one-generation task, and debts must be distributed over a longer period, which is contrary to Dr. Schacht's policy. Industrial companies and the public are now unable to help the government pay for the large expenses of military preparations and public works, so the government is currently considering two possible solutions: (1) expanding the existing short-term or medium-term debt that has matured; (2) issuing new public bonds. It is reported that Dr. Funk hopes to increase production after implementing the Four-Year Plan and rationalizing industry to prevent price increases. He also hopes to resolve Germany's international debt problem, believing that when the Jewish emigration problem is resolved, there will be no danger of capital flight, and the relaxation of foreign currency restrictions and consideration of Germany's new loans will be possible.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Five Years of Soviet-American Relations <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Wang Jianming</p>
<p>The United States was the last major capitalist country to establish formal relations with the Soviet Union. Despite repeated requests from American public groups to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the reactionary Hoover government never accepted the demands of the American people. Only after the Republican Party failed in the 1932 election and the Democratic Party led by Roosevelt came to power were formal relations between the two governments established in 1933.</p>
<p>In May of that year, President Roosevelt gave a note to Chairman Kalinin of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, in which he pointed out that the absence of formal relations was an abnormal situation and proposed that the Soviet Union send representatives to consult on establishing normal diplomatic relations and exchanging envoys. The Soviet Union then sent People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov as its representative.</p>
<p>For the Common Effort of Peace</p>
<p>On November 7, 1933, Litvinov, in a speech to American journalists, called attention to the fact that human separation had still existed between the two countries until that time, "In fact, the people of our democratic countries have never stopped working for mutual progress with the greatest sympathy and sincere goodwill." He pointed out that "in the interests of the two countries there is a solid foundation for scientific, cultural and economic cooperation," and therefore the two are "united by a common effort for peace."</p>
<p>On November 16, 1933, Roosevelt exchanged documents with Litvinov regarding the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The past five years have confirmed the fact that the absence of formal relations between the Soviet and American governments was due to obstruction by reactionary forces in the United States, especially Hearst's yellow newspapers, which continue to slander the Soviet Union and spread various false news about it even today. Reactionary forces in the United States are not interested in the two countries cooperating internationally to stop aggression and strive for peace.</p>
<p>The Friendship of the American People</p>
<p>However, the American public knows very well about the Soviet Union's great success in all aspects of the economy and in cultural life, and about its powerful and peaceful policies. The consistent peace policy and anti-aggression policy followed by the Soviet Union has received a heartfelt response in various circles of the United States with extremely different natures. The cooperation between the two governments in seeking peace around the world has been praised by the broadest strata of the American people, who are interested in maintaining peace.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the lack of persistence in the United States in the anti-aggression struggle is due to the oppression of reactionary forces supported by isolationist sentiments, which are still prevalent among the petty bourgeoisie. Monopoly capital is not only uninterested in the struggle against fascist aggression but also helps fascist countries in every possible way.</p>
<p>The relationship between the American and Soviet people is shown by an unchanging spirit of friendship and sympathy. When aerial heroes flew non-stop from Moscow to the United States via the North Pole and stayed there, the American people expressed their special sympathy for the Soviet Union. As soon as they saw the heroic Soviet aviators, the American people cheered for the great socialist country.</p>
<p>In recent years, economic aspects have shown constant expansion and development of trade. In 1933, the total trade volume between the United States and the Soviet Union reached 22.78 million gold yuan, while last year it reached 73.6 million gold yuan. Trade has been expanding year by year, and the original materials show a further consolidation of economic ties between the two countries. The conclusion of the commercial agreement facilitated its growth, and in May the agreement was extended for another twelve months.</p>
<p>Development of Cultural Relations</p>
<p>Cultural relations between the American and Soviet people have also developed with great success. Children's art exhibitions, Stalin Constitution exhibitions, and Soviet architecture exhibitions, with the participation of thousands of Americans, have achieved great success. Soviet films shown on American screens almost always win popular praise and acclaim. Even reactionary newspapers have to admit their success.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing American-Soviet Cultural Association and the Society of Friends of the Soviet Union, there is also the recently established American-Soviet Association for the Promotion of Diplomatic Relations. The purpose of the association is to make the Soviet Union's peace policy and achievements in socialist construction known to every family.</p>
<p>Next year (referring to this year - translator), the Soviet Union's participation in the New York International Exhibition will play an important role in making Americans aware of the Soviet Union's achievements in politics, economy, and culture.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the relations between the two countries will continue to develop in the spirit of friendship and mutual sympathy between the American and Soviet people, because both great nations are interested in maintaining world peace.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The British government released its plan to reform the British cotton textile industry tonight, advocating the establishment of a Cotton Textile Industry Bureau, composed of fifteen members, and financially assisted by the Ministry of Commerce. The bureau's powers are as follows: (1) managing the registration and taxation of factories; (2) assisting in improving the production and sales of the cotton textile industry through technical, economic, and publicity methods; (3) reviewing cotton textile industry plans by region or department. Special steps under consideration include the establishment of an export promotion committee and an advisory committee, and efforts to protect the interests of the rayon, wool, and textile industries. The most important aspect of this cotton textile industry reform plan is the mandatory registration of factories by the Cotton Textile Industry Bureau. The registration of merchants is to be decided by the merchants themselves. Government assistance is calculated in pounds, with a maximum of £40,000 per year for the first five years. The bureau's branches can also borrow money to handle various matters, but this debt is limited to £3 million.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e30">Congratulations, Chamberlain! <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The result of Chamberlain's cabinet's policy of appeasement over the past year has been, on the one hand, to strengthen the arrogance of the fascist aggressors, and on the other hand, to cause the fall and near fall of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and even Spain. At the same time, the position of Britain and France in Europe and even in the world has been greatly and negatively affected. Therefore, people with righteousness and vision within Britain have launched opposition movements, which have become increasingly fierce recently. This is undeniable. This situation is not only not a blessing for the Chamberlain cabinet but also not a blessing for the entire world.</p>
<p>To break this dangerous status quo, apart from the victory of the Anglo-French People's Front under the active policy of the Soviet Union and the United States, the only other option is for the Chamberlain cabinet to abandon its appeasement policy under internal and external pressure, starting with strengthening Anglo-French cooperation, strengthening the peace and democracy front, and jointly attacking the fascist aggressors.</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 7th stated: Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 6th: "Britain and France have an inseparable relationship, and if the vital interests of France are threatened, no matter where this threat comes from, Britain must immediately cooperate with France." Chamberlain's speech is naturally a reflection of the recent expression of support for democratic countries by the Soviet Union and the United States and the anti-appeasement movement in Britain. Chamberlain's declaration will naturally have a consolidating effect on the peace and democracy front and can also serve as a major force of resistance against fascist aggressors, but first and foremost, Chamberlain's regime can thereby obtain temporary stability. Therefore, we must say, "Congratulations, Mr. Chamberlain!"</p>
<p>However, Hitler and Mussolini, who "get rich" by intimidation, at most express shock and protest in the newspapers at this kind of declaration. Mussolini's followers even said sarcastically: "If you step on a lion's tail, it will definitely bare its teeth to scare people, but it's just a 'row of false teeth' — Therefore, we must intensify the efforts of the people of Britain and France to urge their governments to implement this 'joint resistance to aggression' declaration immediately after it is made, and to use strength to sanction the aggressors — what we want to congratulate is not the Chamberlain regime's transformation from danger to safety, but the strengthening of the democratic peace front, creating an invincible lineup to encircle and suppress fascist aggressors.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Dutch East Indies Air Route Will Extend to Hong Kong: Hong Kong Will Become a Major Hub for Far East Air Routes, Dutch East Indies Company Will Set Up Hong Kong Station and Contact Pan American, Planned to Be Realized Next Year, Hong Kong to London Only Takes Four Days <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong's civil aviation industry is developed. Three of the four major Far East air routes (Pan American, Imperial Airways, Air France, Dutch East Indies) have established stations in Hong Kong. The only one remaining is the Dutch East Indies Company (full name Royal Dutch East Indies Airline). According to Mr. Horton, representative of the company's Philippine office, the Dutch East Indies line will also extend from Batavia to Saigon to Hong Kong in order to connect with the Pan American line. If this statement is realized, Hong Kong will become a hub for air routes between the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, France, and various parts of the Far East. Regarding the above news, although all aviation authorities in Hong Kong said that they have not received confirmation, they also said that this move is a natural development. It is also very possible that the British and Dutch authorities have discussed this issue in London. It is reported that the Dutch East Indies Company had sought the consent of the United States to add a line from Java to Manila. However, since Washington did not reply for a long time, it changed its target to Hong Kong. If the U.S. had agreed to the establishment of the route earlier, there would be no need to set up a station in Hong Kong, as its purpose was to connect with the Pan American line. It is also reported that the Dutch East Indies line and the Dutch Airline (full name Royal Dutch Airline) have always been in contact. The Dutch Airline is the parent company, with Amsterdam as its headquarters. Its routes cover the European continent and have regular routes between Amsterdam and Java, with Batavia as its headquarters. The Dutch East Indies line is limited to the Dutch East Indies archipelago and has flights to Australia, Saigon, Darica, and northern Borneo. The Dutch Airline authorities will specially manufacture DC-4 express planes to participate in the Batavia-Amsterdam line next year and will add night flights. In the future, this section of the journey can be reduced from five and a half days to two and a half days. If so, if the line establishes a station in Hong Kong, the journey from London to Hong Kong can be reduced to four days. It is reported that the DC-4 plane can carry 40 passengers during the day and only 16 passengers at night.</p>
<h3 id="e32">After Fujian Tea Is Transported to Hong Kong for Centralized Export, Sales Break Forty-Year Record: A Total of 90,000 Boxes Were Sold Last Year, With a Profit of More Than Two Million Yuan <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper's special dispatch: Tea is not only Fujian Province's largest specialty product but also its most important export. Annual production is over 10 million yuan, and it has had a considerable position internationally in the past. However, in recent years, because tea-making methods have not been improved, the quality has also declined. Other factors, such as transportation congestion and lack of capital, are also fatal to Fujian tea. Business has therefore greatly decreased, and the biggest blow has been the large-scale dumping of tea products from Taiwan and Ceylon to various parts of Southeast Asia, Europe, and America. Fujian tea's position has almost been completely encroached upon. Later, the crisis deepened, and the Fujian Provincial Government could not sit idly by. Therefore, it used the power of the government to resolve to reorganize it. First, it sent personnel to various places in Southeast Asia and Ceylon to investigate in order to improve the quality. Then, it established a black tea chain store to control the tea leaves transported overseas and set up a tea warehouse management office to store the tea leaves transported to Fuzhou and insure them. From April of last year, it merged the original tea improvement agencies to establish a tea management office.</p>
<p>Last year, when normal tea leaves began to be produced, X people invaded Minyou, and Xiamen unfortunately fell. The defense of Fuzhou was also suddenly tight. Tea is the lifeline of Fujian, and foreign trade cannot be interrupted once. Therefore, the tea management office transported all the tea leaves for foreign sales to Hong Kong. One reason was for safety, and the other was for convenience of foreign sales. At that time, except for the first spring and white hair tea leaves, which were sold in Fuzhou in advance at the request of merchants and foreign firms, all other tea leaves for foreign trade were transported to Hong Kong. Therefore, after the "May Tenth" war, Fujian tea exports can be said to have been completely concentrated in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Last year, the tea leaves transported to Hong Kong from Fujian totaled approximately 120,000 boxes by the end of the year. Approximately 90,000 boxes were sold. Of the 30,000 boxes in storage, most are by-products of flakes and powder, with very little refined tea. Of the remaining refined tea, 70-80% are Minbei Xiaozhong, and only 20-30% are Kung Fu tea. As far as the sales of Fujian tea are concerned, the Soviet Union accounted for the majority last year, and Europe and America were slightly inferior. In terms of price, it was approximately 50-60% or 20-30% higher than in previous years. This number can be said to have broken the record of Fujian tea for the past forty years. The reason for this is not the result of the accidental increase in the quality of tea but rather because, at this time, the tea products of Henan Province, Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province and Hubei Province were also concentrated in Hong Kong, openly displaying samples, evaluating quality and price in the same market. Fujian Province tea leaves are indeed superior to those of other provinces. The true advantages can be distinguished, which is why Fujian tea exports have made such long strides in the last few months of last year. According to statistics, the profit from the export of Fujian tea transported to Hong Kong last year totaled more than 2 million yuan. This is entirely due to the Fujian Provincial Government's sharp reforms to tea. (Jun)</p>

<p>At around 7:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a teenager was found dead in a pool of blood on Lockhart Road near Jianshan Road in Wan Chai. Passersby reported it to the police, who reported it back to the police station. The officer on duty immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. When the detectives arrived, they saw that the teenager had suffered serious head injuries, his feet and mouth were also broken, and his internal organs were also injured. They inquired with nearby residents and shopkeepers, but no one knew the real cause. The police found this matter extremely strange and suspected that the teenager was murdered, and also suspected that he fell to his death. They immediately telegraphed the government photographer to take photos of the scene and the deceased's body. Then, they called a hearse to transport the body to the mortuary. Afterwards, the police found that the teenager was a cashier at the tram company, named Ye Fu, who lived at a certain number on East Street. It was also heard that the teenager had an argument with someone near there late last night, which resulted in him being beaten by several people with iron bars and sharp weapons. Because it was late at night, there were few pedestrians, and only a few cries for help were heard. After that, nothing was heard.</p>

Li Jianfeng first refuted it, followed by representatives who successively expressed their opinions. After more than an hour of debate, there was still no result. The chairman, considering the importance of the case, asked the representatives to study it in detail and discuss it again at the next meeting.

<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>An Interview with Ms. Cai Kuishi, General Secretary of the Association</p>
<p>As the motherland is reborn, alert women are also striding forward towards the rising sun of the times. — Ms. Cai Kuishi, General Secretary of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association, and Ms. Gui Bao, Vice President of the World YWCA, hosted a grand gathering for women in the Yanjing Hotel the night before last, and our sincere expectations were noted in yesterday's newspaper, so I will not elaborate further here. To understand the activities of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association during the War of Resistance, our reporter visited Ms. Cai Kuishi again yesterday and obtained many moving materials.</p>
<p>The night before last, the reporter had to leave midway due to an engagement. When the reporter saw Ms. Cai again, she said excitedly:</p>
<p>"This is truly a rare opportunity. Not only did the representatives and leaders of the women's community in Hong Kong attend enthusiastically, but also representatives from the YWCA branches in Guangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Kunming participated. Therefore, I was very happy to report the recent work of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association to everyone, and I hope that the branches in various regions will coordinate and develop their work. Mr. He Xiangning was delighted that this was a rare gathering of women representatives from all over the country and gave enthusiastic encouragement. The gist of her speech was: 'The freedom, equality, and fraternity advocated by the YWCA are in line with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of people's livelihood, people's rights, and democracy. This is the most urgent need for China today. I hope everyone will seize this excellent environment and work towards this goal...' I don't understand Cantonese, but I only know that this was roughly the gist."</p>
<p>Ms. Cai is originally from Jinhua, Zhejiang, and has been working at the YWCA for over ten years. She speaks Mandarin very fluently.</p>
<p>Getting to the main topic, Ms. Cai answered the reporter's questions very kindly:</p>
<p>"The National Association of Young Women's Christian Association has more than 10,000 members, including people from all walks of life. There are 19 branches in cities across the country. Three or four have been suspended due to the war. The headquarters has sufficient funds. In addition to donations from countries around the world, the branches in various regions must also pay membership fees to the headquarters every year. For example, Hong Kong and Tianjin have to pay 1,000 yuan in national currency every year. However, for branches that are unable to be independent, the headquarters provides assistance until they grow, and then they are released. For example, most of the expenses of the Kunming branch are subsidized by the headquarters."</p>
<p>——The reporter believes that this fully demonstrates the spirit of motherhood in nurturing children!</p>
<p>Ms. Cai continued:</p>
<p>"This time, we came to Hong Kong and launched a fundraising campaign with the Hong Kong branch, raising more than 16,000 yuan. Two-thirds will go to the Hong Kong branch, and one-third will go to the headquarters. This is a rough outline of the financial situation.</p>
<p>What international publicity has the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association done during the War of Resistance? Ms. Cai said:</p>
<p>"There are YWCA organizations in 58 countries around the world. We reported the atrocities of the Japanese to the YWCAs of various countries as if we were reporting to our own families. The telegrams expressing sympathy and assistance flew in like snowflakes. Religious groups also prayed for us and sent donations of over 100,000 to help us in the War of Resistance. China also has representatives attending the General Assembly of the World YWCA, and Ms. Huang Gui Bao is the Vice President of the Association."</p>
<p>What specific work have the branches of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association done in the War of Resistance?</p>
<p>Ms. Cai explained the four work guidelines to the reporter in detail: 1. Rescue and relief; 2. Propaganda and organization; 3. Popularization of wartime education and technical education; 4. Advocacy of industrial production. What impressed the reporter more was that before the War of Resistance, the headquarters had already run six terms of first aid classes, and after the outbreak of the war, they were assigned to serve in various military hospitals. In order to reduce the worries of the soldiers at the front, they also launched a service campaign for the families of soldiers on expeditions. They used various methods, both spiritual and material, to comfort the families of soldiers. For example, telling them stories of the War of Resistance has been very effective.</p>
<p>Elementary school students donated their money to buy clothing materials for the YWCA to make clothes, and then returned them to the children to personally carry piles of cotton clothes to comfort the troops. The children and female comrades felt infinite joy, and the soldiers were deeply moved.</p>
<p>Students who are in financial difficulty are given relief. There are also many unemployed women who are living in hardship, so they are guided to engage in various industries to enrich production. Although each region has its own situation, they are all working hard under the general goal of "Resistance to Japan First." —— This is an outline of their work.</p>
<p>Ms. Cai will leave Hong Kong during the day to go to Kunming, Guiyang, and Chongqing to inspect the wartime work of the YWCA in various regions. It is expected that she will be able to return to the headquarters by the end of April.</p>

<p>Three of our brave men who had been accommodated in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon City secretly left the camp. Unfortunately, they were discovered by the guards and injured by gunfire. Just as the authorities were planning to improve the situation, three more brave men secretly left the camp yesterday. They were discovered by British police, who opened fire to stop them, resulting in a bloody incident in which a passerby was injured. Our reporter went to investigate the incident afterwards. It is reported that at 11:25 yesterday morning, one brave man carrying an axe, hoe, and hammer secretly left the camp. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by a British policeman numbered 35 just a few feet away from the camp. The British policeman shouted at them to stop, but the three ignored him. The British policeman then sounded a loud whistle, intending to intercept them. They turned a deaf ear. The British policeman then fired three shots, intending to warn them. At that time, a young girl was passing by. After the shots rang out, she was hit in the buttocks. The young girl fainted on the spot. When the British policeman saw that he had injured someone, he immediately notified the Kowloon Hospital to send a car to the scene to take the injured person to the Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The injured person was named Lu Ru, 22 years old, and lived on the second floor of 159 Tam Kung Road. Fortunately, she was injured in the buttocks, which is not a vital area, and there is no danger to her life. As for the three brave men, two escaped, and one was detained and returned to the camp for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Under Air, Land, and Sea Invasion by the Japanese, the Battle in Bao'an is Tense Again. Japanese Shelling on Dachanshan, Four Roads of Japanese Troops Repelled, Number of Japanese Warships Increases Sharply off Dapeng, Women and Children Evacuated from Various Areas <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Since Bao'an County was ravaged by the Japanese army last year, there has been no clean land left. Ruined walls and broken houses are everywhere. As it stands now, business is far worse than before. Unexpectedly, before the vitality has recovered, the Japanese are attempting a second invasion. Yesterday, the 6th, they sent out a large number of remnant Japanese troops and a fleet to invade Huangsonggang in the second district of Bao'an County. As a result, the battle situation has become particularly urgent again. According to talks with passengers who came to Hong Kong from Bao'an yesterday morning, the Japanese army has been sending out large numbers of bombers to bomb various areas of Bao'an since the 3rd of this month, attempting to invade. Later, they were tightly repelled by our defending troops. Unexpectedly, on the 6th, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion with naval, land, and air forces, and sent three Japanese warships to harass the waters off Dachanshan. Our defending troops stationed there fought fiercely with the Japanese all day long. The sound of artillery and guns could be heard throughout Bao'an. Now, women and children in Bao'an have automatically evacuated, and the market situation is becoming increasingly desolate. A desolate atmosphere has reappeared. Yesterday, a Mr. So-and-so who returned to Hong Kong from Bao'an on a small ferry said that the Japanese invaded my Western Route. The defending troops of the Western Route fought bravely to defend their homeland, so the Japanese were unsuccessful and retreated hesitatingly. Although the situation is deteriorating, the ferry continues to operate. If the war breaks out again, we will discuss it again at that time. In addition, Liang Chuangzhong, the head of the Dapeng police station, came to Hong Kong yesterday on official business. According to him, after Dapeng was ravaged by the Japanese army a month ago, the people fled in all directions. At the beginning of the recovery, many people did not dare to return. The police station sent personnel to persuade the refugees in various places. Now, 90% of the people in the city have returned to their hometowns, and shops are gradually resuming business. In the past month, Japanese warships have been cruising back and forth in the waters off Dapeng, with varying numbers. The number suddenly increased the day before yesterday, with a total of seven ships. Motorboats are sent out during the day to patrol the coast, and searchlights are used to detect at night. The lights shine directly on Dapeng, as if they are spying. However, the local people are very calm, and the public order is also good.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Kunshan: Great Compassion Hall of the North in Fond Remembrance <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinfei</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>"A small building, east wind again last night," evokes the feeling of "I cannot bear to look back on the moon in my homeland." The cold rain knocks on my thoughts, the fire in the stove barely red. On this silent night, it is easier to miss friends in distant lands. "Last year's weather, old pavilion," where are the partners who shared life and death in the past, now drifting to? Life in the Great Compassion Hall of the North was like a fire. After working for a day, thirty or fifty young people were reluctant to disperse after dinner. Lingering, everyone huddled around the candles on the table, talking endlessly about their ambitions and backgrounds, or, excitedly discussing a problem. It feels like it was just yesterday. However, what is the state of the Great Compassion Hall of the North now? Where are the partners who lived this kind of life together for more than half a month, now drifting? When they are marching, when they are resting, when they see the bright moon overhead, what are their feelings when they think of that warm and happy reunion life of half a month? —— The vision and state of mind of a warrior, only the elderly and the laggards of life have memories of the past, because they can only rely on warm memories to warm their chests that are about to cool. Are the companions still holding on to the unfinished candles and excitedly reviewing today's work?</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>"Walking to the old courtyard gate, why knock lightly? There are no small dogs barking, only dry wells and dilapidated nests, but some brick moss and weeds, twigs of flowers and willows. Gather firewood at will, whose kitchen is this black ash?" —— Kong Shangren's "Lament for the Red South" "The Order of Peace" It is, I am old, why do I only have some memories?</p>
<p>In my memory, the Great Compassion Hall of the North is not like the "Order of Peace" that I quoted above. It is located on Baihua Street (Dream Flower Street) in Kunshan, less than a hundred steps away from Kunshan Park. The "morning bell and evening drum" (note) of Ma'anshan conveys warnings to us very clearly with the autumn wind.</p>
<p>The Great Compassion Hall of the North is a nunnery. The surroundings and interior easily remind us of the "Jingxiu Nunnery" at the beginning of Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q": "The white wall protrudes from the new green, and behind the low earthen wall is a vegetable garden." There is a bamboo forest leaning against the west wall, and there are also three lush osmanthus trees behind the nunnery. This is probably something that the Jingxiu Nunnery does not have.</p>
<p>When we moved in, the nuns in the nunnery had all gone to the countryside to take refuge. One room was sealed with a notice, and miscellaneous objects were piled up in a mess. The other rooms were empty.</p>
<p>We used the front main hall as a reception room and dining hall, and the rear main hall was converted into a dormitory. The nuns' living quarters were arranged for comrades to live in or used as offices.</p>
<p>We lived and worked together here. The hearts of thirty or fifty young people are connected into one, and the lives of thirty or fifty young people are also connected together. The boundary between you and me is eliminated, and the hypocrisy spread by the city is washed away. Loyalty and frankness are like the most loving fellow brothers.</p>
<p>What is especially unforgettable is the evening. The fatigue of working for a day is eliminated during dinner. It is still early before the scheduled bedtime. If there is no special duty in the evening, and the sky has a good moon, at this time, sitting at the table and guarding the candles, or going outside to take a walk to relax, telling each other about their experiences or expectations, becomes a pleasant habit.</p>
<p>Because life is pleasant, we also love the Great Compassion Hall, where we live with our partners. Every night, lying on the straw mat is warm and fragrant. When I wake up in the middle of the night, a piece of moonlight shines in through the window. The glass lamp in front of the shrine is dimly lit, and I can vaguely see the kind face of the Goddess of Mercy in the shrine. I feel as if I am sinking into poetry. The snoring of my partners becomes the rhythm of music. In this poetry and music, I vaguely and unconsciously fall into dreamland. —— And now, all of this can only be enjoyed in dreams.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Has the Great Compassion Hall of the North become ashes now? Are the man-made defensive trenches still standing? In that bamboo forest, are the characters carved clumsily with a small knife still there?</p>
<p>Let everything be destroyed. We will build a new one on this old base. The crabs in Yangcheng Lake are fat, and the fresh and tender duck noodles are the best breakfast. Three or five of us young people will gather here, celebrate our victory here, and drink our triumphal wine here.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>"Helplessly, the flowers fall, seemingly familiar swallows return, I linger alone in the fragrant garden path" (Manshu, Washing Stream Sand). At this time and place, it is not only those suffering from homesickness who have difficulties to express, but also the sad season for travelers. But such days will not last long. In less than three years, we will become seemingly familiar returning swallows, retracing the land we once missed. Although the old one has been destroyed on this, the new one will be built exceeding the previous one.</p>
<p>We don't need to ask in what year and month we will be able to return to our homeland. What we need to ask is whether we have the determination to return to our homeland and what we are doing now.</p>
<p>Note: During the war, Kunshan used bells and drums on Ma'anshan to indicate air raid alarms. Bells were used for alarms, and drums were used to signal the all-clear. Because the mountain was not far from the war zone, alarms sounded almost every morning and were incessant until the evening. Therefore, my companions used "morning bells and evening drums" to describe it.</p>
<p>Of course, transportation in various parts of China is still difficult, and the travel industry in China is not yet widespread, but this war has already given us a good lesson. Looking at the place names in the newspaper, I only hate myself for not going to see them in peacetime.</p>
<p>But I have finally been to Huangshan, which is a small comfort in addition to my self-hatred.</p>
<p>I miss Huangshan, and I will always miss Huangshan.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese shipping has suffered a serious blow. Most of their merchant ships have been requisitioned back to the country. Therefore, the number of Japanese ships passing through Hong Kong has decreased recently. However, since the Japanese occupied Guangzhou, the number of Japanese ships passing through Hong Kong has increased sharply, averaging one or two ships entering the port every day. The Japanese ship ××, which ran aground in Hong Kong due to wind on September 1 last year, has also departed from Japan and will arrive in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. It is expected that this will have a significant impact on the Pearl River shipping.</p>
<p>The Kma of Java Shipping Company arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore last night and berthed at Berth A5 in the Central District. It is reported that the ship needs to arrive in Singapore before the old Lunar New Year to transport goods from Hong Kong. The schedule has been slightly changed. It will depart for Xiamen at 7:00 this morning and will return to Hong Kong the morning after (the 11th). It will rush to Singapore that afternoon.</p>
<p>The Asian Queen of Changxing Company set sail from Hong Kong at noon today, heading to Shanghai, Japan, Chemdolly, and Hwas. The Russian Queen of the company is now scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month and depart for Little Luzon at 6:00 p.m. on the same day.</p>
<p>The Lishun Slave, an agent of the Melchers Trading Company, is now scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month and depart for Little Luzon, Shela, and various parts of Europe at 6:00 p.m. on the same day.</p>
<p>The President Conardage of American President Lines will arrive in Hong Kong from the Philippines the day after (the 10th) and depart for Shanghai, Japan, Honolulu, San Francisco, and Los Angeles at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.

<p>— Pillow Moon</p>
<p>A Travelogue of Elden Castle</p>
<p>Since I arrived in England in the autumn of the 26th year [of the Republic], time has flown by like a swift steed. In the past six months, I have visited almost all the famous spots in London. However, there are still many unique and magnificent areas outside the capital that are worth seeing. I have always regretted not being able to visit them. The end of winter has passed, and spring has returned to the earth. My fellow countryman, Brother Yi Qiheng, is currently interning at the Stamford Electrical Company. Considering the mild weather since the beginning of spring this year, he plans to invite me for a day trip during the Qingming holiday. I gladly accepted. Stamford is a town in central England, about two hundred miles from the capital, accessible by a three-hour train ride. On the morning of April 24th, I went to Euston Station and boarded a Sunday excursion train. The regular third-class fare from London to Stamford is seventeen shillings and sixpence, but the round-trip excursion ticket on that day cost only seven shillings and ninepence. This is probably a special low price offered by the railway company to encourage tourists, a way to attract business. The train left London and traveled through vast and boundless plains. Distant mountains emerged, and the forests thrived. The lush greenery assailed the senses. Having lived in the city for a long time, I deeply resented the noise. At this moment, being in the countryside, I felt relaxed and detached, and worldly thoughts were cleansed.</p>
<p>I arrived in Stamford at 1 p.m., thirty minutes behind schedule. In addition to Mr. Yi, waiting at the station were Mr. Jian Yinguan, who was interning at the same factory as Mr. Yi, and Mr. Gao Deqiang and Mr. Lü Dekuan, who had just come to Stamford from Manchester. Mr. Gao is also from Nantong and studies textiles in Manchester. This was our first meeting. Mr. Jian is from Jiangdu, and Mr. Lü is from Dantu. It is a coincidence that the five of us belong to the same province. After eating out of the station, we strolled along the streets of Stamford. The town has a sparse population and undeveloped commerce. The city center is only a street less than half a mile long. What is noteworthy is the urban planning. Although it is a small town, it is not inferior to others in terms of municipal facilities. City hall, churches, parks, schools, and hospitals are all available, and the city appearance is particularly orderly. This is probably a general phenomenon throughout England. Mr. Yi told me that our itinerary for today is the nearby Elden Castle, about 20 miles from Stamford, which is known as the Wonderland of the English Island. In spring, summer, and autumn, tourists often tether their horses there. It is not only a famous area of Stamford but also a scenic spot throughout England.</p>
<p>The Stamford Motor Company, for the convenience of tourists, operates special tour buses on Sundays, which can carry passengers directly to the site. The bus was originally scheduled to depart at 2 p.m. Because it was chilly that day, there were few tourists. Besides the five of us, there was no one else. So we waited again and again. Finally, two Englishmen joined us. The bus can accommodate forty people, but now there are only seven. The meager income probably does not even cover the fuel costs. The bus left Stamford and traveled into the mountains. The highway undulated tortuously due to the varying terrain, and the steepness made people feel uneasy. The rural scenery of England frequently presented a picturesque view. Among the lush greenery, a corner of a red building occasionally appeared, partially hidden. These are the farmhouses of the farmers. It is said that throughout England, even in remote and impoverished areas, tap water, gas, and electricity are available. From this point of view, the comfort of life of English farmers is simply incomparable to that of our country.</p>
<p>The bus traveled for about an hour and arrived at Elden Hill. The trees were dense and the streams gurgled. The scenery was quite similar to Taoguang Bamboo Path in Hangzhou, while the winding mountain paths and flat roads resembled the Mausoleum Park in Nanjing. As I traveled here, I was filled with endless sorrow. Looking back at my motherland, I did not know where to start shedding tears. The bus drove straight up the mountain to a ticket office. Someone boarded the bus to sell tickets, one shilling per person, which meant we had reached the entrance to Elden Castle. After advancing another half a mile, the road curved, and we suddenly found ourselves in an open area. The ancient castle, majestically perched on the mountaintop, came into view.</p>
<p>The attractions of Elden Castle can be divided into two parts: the castle itself and the adjacent gardens. After getting off the bus, we first visited the famous garden. It is located to the left of the castle, between the mountains, in a secluded valley. The entire garden is laid out in this valley, covering about a hundred acres, with winding paths leading through it. A river runs through the middle, a confluence of mountain springs. Countless exotic flowers and rare plants are scattered throughout the garden, forming clusters of blossoms that are brightly colored and pleasing to the eye, like a natural painting. As we advanced along a small path, we saw a streak of silver shooting straight into the sky. Approaching it, we found an octagonal pavilion, about eight feet high, with three stories. Bells were hanging from the corners, seemingly imitating those of the East. The pavilion was in the middle of the river, and its top was fitted with a sprinkler. When the water was turned on, it shot out like splashing pearls and flying jade, and the white light reflected it, transforming it into five colors. It was the most spectacular view from afar and the most ingeniously designed feature of the entire garden. Afterwards, we saw a sign near the pavilion indicating that we could go to the Chinese Temple from there. We were overjoyed at this, as we did not expect to find such relics of our homeland in the fairyland of the English island, thirty thousand miles away. We gladly followed the path indicated, but after a long time, we could not find it anywhere. Looking around from a high vantage point, there was no sign of the temple. At that time, there was a three-story square tower built of cement by the side of the road. We decided to climb it to get a better view. But even after reaching the top, we still saw nothing. Disappointed, some of us jokingly said that perhaps the Chinese Temple was the very thing we were climbing. But the tower itself did not resemble a Chinese pagoda, let alone a temple. Just as we were about to descend the tower and search again, a Westerner happened to be holding a guidebook. Looking at it, we found that the Chinese Temple marked on the map was indeed the place we were climbing. The doubts in our minds were dispelled. Westerners often have a superficial understanding of Chinese things, making far-fetched associations. Now, seeing what they call a Chinese Temple, which is actually nothing like one, it is like calling a stag a horse. From this one instance, it can be seen that the number of such misunderstandings of China by these people is probably countless.</p>
<p>After descending the tower, we viewed the waterfall. The waterfall was not very large, but the slopes on both sides were planted with various flowers, creating a riot of color that was exceptionally beautiful. Being there, looking around, it felt as if we were in a book, truly a blessed place. At times, we saw a Western-style building in the forest across the mountain, with smoke curling upwards, suggesting that it was inhabited. Upon approaching it, we found that it was a Swiss chalet, a restaurant and lodging combined. We had some refreshments there. The hostess, Miss Johnson, and several waitresses greeted us with smiles and quickly seated the guests. Their innocent and gentle expressions made us feel relaxed and detached. The environment can indeed affect people in this way.</p>
<p>Leaving the garden, we arrived at a large lake where we could go boating. By this time, the setting sun was casting a thin glow. The lines of Bai Juyi, "The sun sinks, leaving a red shadow; the wind settles, leaving the green ripples still," best describe the scene. We then visited the ancient castle. The castle was a palace from the feudal era, entirely built of stone. The design was purely Gothic, incorporating high towers—round or square, tall or short—in various forms, all extremely beautiful. There was originally a moat outside the castle, spanned by a drawbridge. In the past, the drawbridge would be raised at night to prevent enemy attacks. Now the water has dried up, and the grandeur of those days is gone. The entire structure is far more majestic than the Tower of London. According to historical records, the mountain was originally the fief of the Earl of Harewood. Two hundred years ago, the earl spent a fortune building a large castle there as his residence. The earl died in 1827, before the project was completed. His descendants continued the work and finally finished it. In addition to the palace buildings, they also created gardens, spending a total of one million pounds, which was truly astonishing. Inside the castle, there were great halls, a church, a garden, and a painting studio, all extremely exquisite. Today, part of it has been converted into a restaurant. The magnificent palace, originally intended for the benefit of future generations, has undergone changes in less than two hundred years. How could the Earl of Harewood have ever dreamed of such a transformation?</p>
<p>To the right of the castle is a flag tower, also a tall stone tower, used for observation. We climbed to its summit, from which we could see the rolling hills in their entirety, truly the best spot on the entire mountain. After our tour, we returned to Stamford in the same bus. At two o'clock that night, I took the train back to London, arriving at dawn at five o'clock. In the faint moonlight, London was still sound asleep.</p>
<h3 id="e46">A Poem <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shiying</p>
<p>The brilliant lights shine like stars,</p>
<p>The sea is vast and green in sight.</p>
<p>Passing through mountains of stone bamboo shoots,</p>
<p>A single leaf floats on the river's edge.</p>
<p>The wind and clouds surge without limit,</p>
<p>The mournful cries of geese are unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an air raid warning is announced below,</p>
<p>Circling in the sky, unable to stop.</p>
<p>January 9th, Year 28 [of the Republic], departed from Hong Kong at night, rested in Guilin the next morning, and when about to arrive in Chongqing, there was an air raid warning, hovering in the sky for a long time before landing.</p>

<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The Mountains in Chinese Paintings</p>
<p>I am someone who likes painting, but since I am not good at it and have no opportunity to study painting, I can only try to read some books on painting theory and appreciate the works of great painters.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because of my environment, I have always been deeply ashamed. Being born as a Chinese person, yet knowing nothing about Chinese painting, my personal understanding of painting is very superficial. But honestly, my ability to appreciate Western paintings is slightly stronger than my ability to appreciate Chinese paintings.</p>
<p>Due to my limited experience, I have always thought that Chinese landscape paintings are laughable. I even have a tendency to look down on Chinese painting, thinking that the high mountains and steep peaks shrouded in clouds and mist, the flying springs in the deep mountains, and the strange pines growing out of the cliffs are nothing more than the fantasies of Chinese painters. I thought that Chinese paintings are not realistic and that they have no significant value.</p>
<p>Since my trip to Huangshan, I have begun to respect Chinese books. My concept of Chinese painting has completely changed. Walking into the depths of Huangshan, what I see in front of me is not a magnificent Chinese landscape painting? Look, another one, and another one! There are simply endless Chinese paintings. Huangshan is truly a mountain in Chinese paintings. I am not traveling in Huangshan, I am traveling in Chinese paintings!</p>
<p>I Hate Myself</p>
<p>I am not someone who travels often. When I do travel occasionally, it is certainly more memorable, especially when the place visited is so memorable.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, I have hated myself. Seeing those familiar place names in the newspapers, so close, so important, so familiar, why didn't I go and visit them before?</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Conspiracy to Destroy Our Silkworm Industry <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ma</p>
<p>The silkworm seed farm only has relations with the "Central China Silk Company." Not only are the amount and price of silkworm seeds determined by the "Company" at will, but the "Central China Company" can also directly exchange silkworm seeds for the farmers' legal tender, using military tickets or counterfeit money to fool the seed farm. In this way, isn't the silkworm seed farm just a puppet of the Japanese?</p>
<p>Regarding Article 5: it seems to be beneficial to the farmers, but when everything is in the hands of the Japanese, the silkworm seed farm is only responsible to the "Central China Silk Company." Therefore, the so-called compensation, in terms of procedure, is of course first the silkworm seed farm compensating the "Central China Silk Company," and then the "Central China Silk Company" compensating the farmers. In this way, after the end of a silkworm season, the seed price that the "Central China Silk Company" has to pay to the seed farm can be used as an example of poor performance, to justify defaulting on half of the seed price, and even forcing the seed farm to pay double the price of the loss. As for the farmers under the tyranny of the "Japanese puppets," they originally cannot avoid fleeing and escaping from the Japanese. Who dares to look for the Japanese because the silkworm harvest is not good? Even if, hypothetically, the Japanese really intend to compensate the farmers for their losses,</p>

<p>Also, regarding the Hong Kong-Macau inter-port soccer match, this year it is Hong Kong's turn to send a team. Yesterday, the General Association received a letter from Macau stating that this year's inter-port match is scheduled to be held in Macau on April 16, and requested that Hong Kong send all first-team players as representatives this time (in the previous two matches, the Hong Kong team sent only reserve players as representatives). After receiving the letter, the General Association will submit it for discussion at the next meeting. (Field Goal Taishui)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Naval Status Increasingly High; Yesterday Yet Another Victory Over Middlesbrough; A Military Force of 1:2 Couldn't Prevail Despite Fierce Battle <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Regular Cup Group A football league, yesterday at 4 PM, Middlesbrough and Navy met at the So Kon Po pitch. In the first week of competition, the American team lost to the Navy by a score of 3-4. Yesterday, they met on a narrow road, and the American team sought to avenge their previous defeat, fielding their full strength. Apart from changing the forward to Thomas, the rest remained as originally planned. The Navy team, having defeated Scots, saw their reputation further enhanced. On this day, they also deployed their elite forces. After the battle commenced, the American forces' momentum was quite loud, repeatedly pressuring the Navy's position. However, due to poor coordination among the forwards, they repeatedly missed good opportunities, allowing the Navy to counterattack with a score of 1-2. The Navy's forwards were quite active on this day, especially Ip, making rapid progress. The defenders also fulfilled their duties. Newland and Thorley vigorously blocked Middlesbrough's Nicolls' advance. Jackson performed quite well, repeatedly averting crises. Sheehan's defense was meticulous, repeatedly blocking the Navy's advance. The forward line's defense was weak, allowing the Navy to break through many times, which was also the cause of Middlesbrough's defeat. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At the start of the match, the American team first applied pressure to the Navy's defense, but they were repelled. Kennedy attempted to break through Cooper's defense, standing and crossing the ball, but neither McVittie nor Mowatt were able to follow up in time. Jackson was able to calmly rescue Adair. At this time, the American team's morale was extremely high, and they attacked the Navy's defense again. Marabou and Pearson successively launched attacks, but were unable to find an opening. Five minutes later, the Navy team strove to improve. Thorley advanced on the left and right, McVittie and Mowatt mutually supporting each other. The American team's rear was in disarray. Dixon launched a long shot, but it went wide. The Navy, determined to win, with Armstrong and Thorley once again launching an attack. The ball reached the front of the American goal, and Mowatt headed it in, but Jackson's save was effective, and Weymouth escaped danger. After the American team cleared the ball, Weymouth, Bradley, and Fitchie covered the counterattack, and Pearson intruded and shot, but Thorley resolutely blocked him, and Pearson retreated. The Navy attacked again, but to no effect. Soon after, Dixon lofted a long ball in front of the goal, and Thorpe rushed forward to head it, but Jackson's quick save turned danger into safety. However, the team was still unable to clear the ball, and the Navy then won two corner kicks, but lacked the final touch to score. The American team decided to try to survive, with Thorley, Nicholls, and Guthrie advancing in three routes. The Navy had long prepared defenses, with Dixon, Fraser, and Hanneyway repelling them, and the American team was unable to advance. Their momentum then weakened. Thorpe received the ball and shot fiercely, passing over Henderson and Cooper desperately entangled him, but Thorpe had already lifted his leg and shot. Jackson could only sigh at his inability to reach it, and the Navy opened the scoring first, their vigor even stronger, frequently attacking the American goal. Before long, Thorpe returned, and Cooper and Sheehan vigorously resisted him. Thorpe accelerated and used the same technique again. Just as his head rose, Jackson dived to save, but the ball had already entered the net. The Navy won the second goal, their vigor like a bull, repeatedly attacking the American team. The first half ended with the Navy leading 2-0.</p>
<p>Switching sides and fighting again, the American team, facing a drastic change in fortunes, strenuously tried to strengthen their attack. However, the Navy's defense was tight, and there was no opportunity to take advantage of. Then, Kennedy got a corner kick, and the point of fall was particularly good. Mowatt headed it in, with great force. Fortunately, Jackson saved it, averting the danger. However, as one wave subsided, another rose. Thorpe, McVittie, Mowatt, Armstrong, Kennedy, and others attacked the goal in five routes. Fortunately, Jackson rushed out to save effectively, preventing them from losing again. After 30 minutes, Armstrong rose from the edge and shot a powerful shot. Jackson caught the ball and kicked it out. Patterson took charge, advancing on horseback. Marabou responded on the left, launching a quick shot, but it was ineffective. Mowatt launched a surprise attack, and Sheehan stepped forward to block. The ball was immediately fired, going into the air. The American team was in a crisis. Nicholls broke through, and Pearson was vigorously resisted by Thorley, but he was still able to shoot quickly, hitting the goalpost. Jackson turned around and saved, but the referee had already ruled that it had entered the net. The American team won back a goal, and their military power was slightly boosted. However, the Navy was unwilling to give in and resolutely counterattacked. McVittie waved his spear and advanced fiercely, and Henderson also responded with close combat, rushing into the position. Jackson dived to rescue, with many difficulties, finally escaping danger. From then on, the teams alternately attacked and defended, with no breakthroughs. At the end of the game, the American team lost 1-2. The lists are as follows:</p>
<p>(Middlesbrough)</p>
<p>Jackson</p>
<p>Sheehan</p>
<p>Cooper</p>

<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Given the current national crisis and the ongoing nationwide resistance against the enemy, physical training is truly an urgent matter.

<p>Entertainment – The Rich Girl's Secret</p>
<p>There Goes My Heart</p>
<p>This is an American-style comedy. The story's material and plot arrangement are entirely for the purpose of achieving comedy. The director's surprising and winning techniques have created many fresh laughs for the audience in this film. The plot's crazy humor also has a very captivating power.</p>
<p>The film depicts the escape of a naive and freedom-loving rich girl, and how she falls in love with a reporter under special circumstances.</p>
<p>Fredric March and Virginia Bruce are not very clever comedians and have not achieved much in the film, giving only mediocre performances. Patsy Kelly is bright and cheerful, and has a very good performance, being a lovely clown. Nancy Carroll, who plays a vain and jealous shop assistant, is making her second comeback to the screen, and her performance is not bad.</p>
<p>Queen... If I Were King</p>
<p>If I Were King</p>
<p>The story is set in the era of King Louis XI of France. In a Paris with strong enemies outside and starving people inside, a poet and swordsman (Ronald Colman) becomes a leader among the rioting masses, killing strong enemies and governing the dynasty, with the deeds he does through courage and talent.</p>
<p>The entire film's performance is magnificent and grand, and all the characters are active and full of life. Among the main actors, Basil Rathbone as Louis is especially worth mentioning. The director did not handle the film very seriously, and the entire film is full of humor, which is a success. Coupled with the moving power of the story itself, the excitement of the plot, and the excellent performances of the actors, it is a successful and impeccable work.</p>
<p>Peace… Arizona Mahoney</p>
<p>Arizona Mahoney</p>
<p>This film can be said to be a martial arts film or a comedy, but both are terribly mediocre. The film is set in the American West, depicting how a woman unintentionally softens a group of bandits, while also interweaving a circus troupe that is too small to be true, and the troupe leader's funny performance. Apart from one or two scenes of struggle and humor, which can be slightly moving and make people laugh, the rest is not very good. It is a very old production from Paramount.</p>
<p>Orient… The Divorce of Lady X</p>
<p>The Divorce of Lady X</p>
<p>Produced by Alexander Korda of the United Kingdom, the story is set in a large hotel in London where a banquet is being held, which coincides with a heavy fog, preventing a group of VIPs from returning, and they borrow rooms in the hotel. Because there are too many people and too few rooms, a young lady breaks into a single man's room, and the story unfolds from there. The performance is extremely humorous and has a very American flavor. Merle Oberon's performance is just right. The male lead is a British star, and his performance is mediocre.</p>
<p>Tahua… Naughty Marietta</p>
<p>Naughty Marietta</p>
<p>An early work by Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, but it is not very successful. The songs are not as popular as those in their two films Rose Marie Maytime at that time. However, this film has won an award.</p>
<p>New World… Modern Woman Recruiting Husband (Cantonese film)</p>
<p>This is adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Recruiting Husband". The plot tells the story of a Xuan Weng, who has millions in assets, but is extremely stingy. Not only does he not contribute a dime to any public welfare undertakings, but he also tries to take advantage of others. At this time, because all walks of life have launched a fundraising campaign to establish a refugee industrial plant, they want to ask him for help. However, as a result, not only did he not take out any money, but he also swiped a few Western pastries at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devised this "Modern Woman Recruiting Husband" method to trick him and then use feminine charm to lure him.</p>
<p>The main places are dance halls and red-light districts. Ma Shizeng and Tan Lanqing, also known for their dance, also eye the business prospects of this film.</p>
<p>The director's technique is still quite flexible.</p>
<p>Central... Wu Wai-kin Fights the Engine Room (Cantonese film)</p>
<p>Due to the exceptionally good box office performance of "Fang Shiyu Fights the Arena", smart filmmakers have spotted a business opportunity. This film is produced with that motive in mind.</p>
<p>Wu Wai-kin is weak and helpless and is bullied by people in the engine room. Forced by circumstances, Wu Wai-kin decides to leave the engine room and go to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts so that he can avenge himself in the future. After many hardships and dangers, one day he finally returns and avenges his father. The plot of this film is that simple. The director has no technique to speak of. Kuang Shanxiao changes his style and plays Wu Huilian, and his performance is still acceptable. Xu Renxin has been away from the screen for a long time, and she is reprising her role in this film, and her performance is still good. The film's sets are too simple, and the fighting scenes at the airport are not tense.</p>
<p>Lee Theatre, Ko Shing Tong… Mulan (Cantonese film)</p>
<p>The plot depicts a modern woman who, because she has performed in the stage play "Mulan", always wants to be a modern "Mulan". Sure enough, when the country is in serious trouble, she fulfills her ambition. The reason is that she discovers a well-organized traitor organization, so she and her lover Kuang Shanzhu Xiao jointly try to crack this secret organization and steal documents. After countless difficulties, they finally achieve their goal, and even the clever and foolish traitors are moved by her great spirit and set off to the front line together.</p>
<p>We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot use the techniques of cinema, and the acting skills of Kuang Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang are lacking.</p>

<p>— Lai Duanfu</p>
<p>Within the past week, from last Wednesday to yesterday, I considered the following absolutely joyful news: Our country resolutely decided to continue participating in this year's Davis Cup international tennis competition, and resolved to join next year's World Olympic Games to be held in Finland.</p>
<p>Japan, with ample time and composure, has long been actively training its tennis players, preparing to compete in the Davis Cup. Recently, the Domei News Agency deliberately publicized that it would transport large quantities of sports equipment to the troops fighting in China. All of this is another means of forcibly demonstrating to the outside world that the domestic situation is not as dire as rumored. Our country's finances are still much more abundant than Japan's. Regarding this kind of outward display, we naturally cannot lag behind in the slightest. Continuing to participate in the Davis Cup and further deciding to participate in the Olympic Games, which the aggressors cannot host nor participate in, is indeed a matter of utmost urgency. Those who say that useful national resources cannot be used for games not only fail to understand the importance of sports to humanity today but also fail to understand the trend of the international situation.</p>
<p>"It is permissible and also possible to do without… and it is harmful." Although participation in the Davis Cup is unavoidable, if, in addition to sending Xu Chengji and Cai Huiquan, who are currently the most successful and already in Europe, it is said that national resources should still be used to dispatch personnel from within the country, then that is something I cannot dare to agree with. This is because there are currently no tennis players in the country who meet international standards. However, if there are enthusiasts who can help the Xu brothers (Wei Pei and Run Pei) from Hong Kong to seize the opportunity to go to Europe for training and broadening their horizons, then that would be a great help. Wei Pei greatly improved after returning from a trip to Europe. Run Pei is only twenty years old and has never seen the world, but his skill is already enough to compete with his elder brother. Both of them have tennis talent. If they receive adequate cultivation, they both have the potential to gain international recognition within three years. I believe that enthusiastic wealthy people like Mr. Hu Wenhu should be responsible for cultivating these two.</p>
<p>Deciding to select and send the more promising football and basketball teams to the Olympic Games (note: there are already reports that basketball has been canceled for the next World Games; I wonder if there was a mistake in the telegram) can be said to be knowing what is urgent. Having learned from the lessons of the previous Games, we already know that these two sports are still not competitive enough on the world stage. Therefore, we should devise training plans as early as possible. Now, bandits are rampant in the inland areas, although they are only a nuisance and not enough to damage our military installations to any significant degree. However, they do hinder the centralized training of sports programs. Therefore, I believe that the Sports Commission should quickly establish a training division in Hong Kong, stationing committee members and selecting personnel to conduct active training. If sufficient preparations can be made in this way, then with the new spirit of China today, it is not impossible to leap to the world championship in football and basketball.</p>
<p>People in the sports world today often value championships too much, and thus spare no expense in luring talent to use for their own purposes. Gradually, schools also indulge athletes, neglecting the initial stages of training beginners, which is far from the original purpose of promoting sports. This is the reason why sports in our country have not progressed for a long time. Mr. Deng Jizhao, a committee member of the sports association, recently advocated canceling the overall championship, emphasizing the strengths of individual skills. He is a visionary with a long-term perspective.</p>
<p>The Chinese Athletic Association's handling of this year's football championship has been extremely shaky, which many people regret. However, I believe that the situation is self-inflicted and not worth regretting. Moreover, without a setback, the lethargic atmosphere cannot be drastically refreshed. This major setback is precisely enough to help them gather their determination to rebuild and work hard for a revival. This may not be a misfortune for the association. The skills of South China are still the best among all teams. One day when they rise up again, I dare to assert that there will still be no match for them in Hong Kong. If you don't believe me, just wait and see. As for South China, the right inside forward and left wing positions in the forward line are vacant. If they don't recruit talent from the B and C teams, they will inevitably decline. It is also useless not to train newcomers during this time when there is no hope for a championship. For the defensive line, it is still best to use Liu Weipei, Lin Depu, and Xie Jinhong.</p>
<p>The selection of representatives for the Hong Kong Interport football team against the Philippines the night before last was quite unexpected. In order to reluctantly include one player each from the Middlesex Navy and the Hong Kong Football Club, they did not hesitate to reverse positions, reducing their combat capabilities. This aptly describes acting based on emotion rather than selecting people based on skill. Li Tiansheng is suitable for both the left and right sides, and Liang Rongzhao can easily handle all three center-back positions, so changing positions is not a problem. However, since it is known to use Hou Rongsheng in the combined team, then why not use Li as the left inside forward and let Hou take on the left or right position, which would be better? If Liang Zhaorong moves to the left, then why not still use Liang as the right forward and fill the left position with Xu Jingcheng, which would be excellent. Fula has never played as a right winger, and forcing him to fill the new vacancy is truly like cutting the feet to fit the shoes. However, according to recent performances, if people are selected based on skill, then the Zheng team will inevitably become a combined Zhongpu team. This can only be achieved with great sportsmanship. If people are indeed selected based on recent performances, then both teams will have the following lineups:</p>
<p>(Interport Team)</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng (Eastern) Hou Chengtuo (Eastern Athletic Association)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South China) Gao Shannu (St. Joseph's)</p>
<p>South China (Beaulieu St. Joseph's) Li Huitang (South China)</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua) Feng Jingxiang (South China)</p>
<p>Liang Rongzhao (South China) Deng Guangsen (South China)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Combined Team)</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Hanni Boru (Kowloon) Yachen (Kowloon)</p>
<p>Wulieqi (Kowloon) Jin Shi (St. Joseph's)</p>
<p>(Eastern Athletic Association) Dixon (Navy) Chen Dehui (South China)</p>
<p>Mai Shaohan (South China) Zuo Zhi (Kowloon)</p>
<p>Song Lingsheng (Eastern) Yang Shuiyi (South China)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Navy played Middlesex at the Happy Valley field. The Navy fought exceptionally bravely and dominated the entire game. If the shooting in the first half had not been inaccurate, they would have won by more than five goals. The new goalkeeper Dickson and the central defender Wu Beinei are both talented. This is probably not good news for the Chinese teams. I advise South China and Eastern to quickly work hard and practice diligently if they want to win the championship. Otherwise, the championship title may ultimately belong to the Navy.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Literary Front <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>"Can you accelerate the heartbeat of life? Can you, as others have done, stir life up into a force?" This quote from Gorky can serve as a warning to all "fighters," and as a motto for literary workers who are also "fighters." It is especially meaningful and cautionary to say this to Hong Kong literary workers.</p>
<p>Literature is a reflection of reality grasped and refined by the author. Strictly speaking, a literary work should be a crystallization of the author's heartbeat, a product born after enduring the labor pains of creation. Literary workers, as one of the "fighters," use their subjective reflection of objective reality to raise a force for improving society. The main goal is to "help people understand themselves, increase their faith in themselves, and develop their thirst for truth" (Gorky). They must "accelerate the heartbeat of life."</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has caused many literary workers to devote themselves to a new struggle. The literary front has become a constituent part of the entire resistance front interwoven in the resistance camp. The new struggle is a burning furnace, with ever-increasing flames and stars scattering at different moments. In short, it is a rich object for grasping and refining, enriching the creative life of literary workers and enabling them to "accelerate the heartbeat of life." Therefore, they have already "stirred up a force." Thus, we follow up with the opening Gorky quote to solicit answers from Hong Kong literary workers.</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy for Hong Kong literary workers to give a good answer. Of course, they can simply and bravely answer: "Yes, we can!" And they must answer in this way, because "whether we like it or not, the responsibility has fallen on our shoulders." However, this can only be regarded as a bold statement at the beginning of their journey?</p>
<p>For more than a year, the literary garden in Hong Kong has still been somewhat barren. Not only is it uncultivated, but many places are also overgrown with seductive poisonous weeds. The work of planting and weeding must be done simultaneously. Hong Kong, as a major overseas station of cultural power, cannot allow the establishment of a literary front to be delayed.</p>
<p>Naturally, literary workers are isolated on this island, unable to be scorched by the ever-increasing flames, and not easily able to see the stars scattering at different moments. However, it is not only works that write about battles and heroes that are valued now; works that write about the struggle and people in the rear are equally highly regarded.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people feel that living on this isolated island is too ordinary. Facing this ordinary and licentious society, how should we write? Yes, a child cannot be born without pregnancy. A false pregnancy can only release a burst of air. But Goethe tells us: "Do not say that reality lacks poetic flavor; because the poet is a poet because he has the talent to bring ordinary objects to the surface of interest." This "talent" is actually not mysterious, but is able to "see development." "Those who do not see development will never see the truth! Because the truth is not as it is, and does not stop moving forward, but is leaping: truth is progress, is contradictory; is struggle" (Lunacharsky). As long as one can see the development of "truth," the creation of literary workers will gain a source and axis. "Truth is progress, is contradictory, is struggle." This determines that literary workers who are isolated on the island can also "accelerate the heartbeat of life" and "stir up a force."</p>
<p>For more than a year, Hong Kong society has been leaping forward. It is home to 1.5 million Chinese people and has become China's wartime "special rear." It is developing from contradictions, and in the process of development, it constantly presents extraordinary situations. If one can portray this development, creation will not be a problem. A group of leaping waves. This is a sign of the development of reality. Isn't this ready-made material for writing? This is one example. Moreover, Hong Kong has become a gathering place for backward elements. They nakedly and unscrupulously show their various phases. Can't we create one or more typical characters to portray them?</p>
<p>From now on, Hong Kong's literary workers should step up their activities! The literary front should be established!</p>

<h3 id="e65">In the Trenches <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Yang</p>
<p>—One of the Wartime Notes—</p>
<p>Outside the gray Zhanjiang, maple leaves dyed half of the mountain red.</p>
<p>The afternoon autumn sun bathes the mountains and rivers in the distance, the wind whispers, bringing bursts of bloody smell, stroking the ripe sorghum, stroking the soldiers' single clothes, making them tremble a little!</p>
<p>The highway, which had long been destroyed, had no pedestrians, no mules and camels, only a trench, perpendicular to the highway, all the way to the foothills a few miles away, covered with withered yellow leaves, and several iron wire nets were laid on the outside.</p>
<p>The surrounding air was very silent, only the scattered gunfire, like firecrackers played by children on the Lantern Festival, punctuated this temporary silent trench.</p>
<p>After two days and nights of fierce fighting, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Those who were not killed or injured were so tired that they were about to die. They all retreated to their respective positions, temporarily stopping the charge and wrestling. The brothers were squatting in the trench, their backs against the wet mud wall of the trench, their guns resting beside them, closing their heavy eyelids, and constantly yawning. But everyone dared not fall asleep, wary of a sneak attack.</p>
<p>Zhao Dazui, who was particularly fond of talking, was telling the story of how brave he was! Although it was thrilling, bizarre and a little moving, the only responses he got were careless acknowledgements, and sometimes no one responded to him at all, but he continued to talk regardless of whether anyone was listening or not. White saliva hung on the corners of his mouth, which was covered with a beard, and his dusty and thin face had an excited glow, as if he was telling the story of bravely killing and forgetting the fatigue of not resting for a few days. As he spoke, he was a bit like the person selling "medicine that can cure a hundred diseases" on the Hong Kong ferry, talking and laughing to himself.</p>
<p>"Zhao Lan, be quiet! Your cannon is far worse than the enemy's."</p>
<p>A cold sneer, like an impatient tone, rang out in the trench, and everyone smiled, even Wang Huzi, who was about to fall asleep, grinned.</p>
<p>"Okay—Liu Ermaozi, you see, if I don't kill ten or eight of them this time, you can come and make fun of me." Zhao Dazui opened his mouth even wider, scattering white saliva everywhere, and also involving some of his personal romances.</p>
<p>A heavy rumbling of motors was heard in the distance, and the brothers stood up, leaning their heads towards the outside of the trench, and even Zhao Dazui stopped talking. Saying a word, "Anyway, it's the same old trick," he squatted down, held his gun, and remained silent.</p>
<p>Three enemy planes painted with red dots were approaching closer and closer at a low altitude of seven hundred feet. The sound of the motors shattered people's eardrums, and the sound of metal colliding with air made people's hearts tense and excited. The brothers squatted down, each holding their guns, hooking the machine guns, and staring upwards through the gaps in the branches with eyes covered in blood. Suddenly, there was a burst of black in front of them, and yellow dust rushed into the sky, broken stones and scrap iron flew in all directions. The brothers' ears rumbled and they could not hear anything, but in their hurried breathing, they smelled a strong smell of sulfur.</p>
<p>The enemy plane left after dropping the bombs—the dust rushed into the sky and was blown away by the crazy wind—the brothers' ears were also gradually recovering their hearing, but what followed was not the rumbling of motors, but the fierce artillery and machine guns, the bullets streaked across the clear sky, whistling past.</p>
<p>The order from above came down, saying "Prepare to charge"—the brothers became excited again, forgetting the fatigue just now. They tightened their legs, tightened their bullets, inserted their sabers, and waited in the trenches for the order to charge.</p>
<p>"Useless Liu Ermaozi, watch me kill a dozen Japanese devils for you!" Zhao Dazui's mouth was frothing even more, he—hand grabbed Liu's clothes, one hand holding the gun, his mouth roaring again.</p>
<h3 id="e66">On Children's Books <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Han Bo</p>
<p>At present, in terms of children's cultural food, in addition to the continued existence of a serious "book shortage" phenomenon, there are also several things that should not be neglected, pressing heavily on children's minds, blocking the bright side like iron gates, causing them to passively look at unintelligible and meaningless books, or simply not see books at all.</p>
<p>In general superficially novel families, parents treat children as adults, giving them to read books that are either "masterpieces" by famous people or foreign classics, as if this is the only way to make children progress. However, the achievements promoted by this are only to drive the brothers into a fog, and even ruin their fragile foundations. I once saw a friend forcing his eleven-year-old child to hold "The Call to Arms and Wandering" all day long and read it to death, and punishing him if he didn't understand (I dare to bet that the friend himself had never read a single word of Mr. Lu Xun's works), so the child always looked sad and frowned. Not to mention the profound and unpredictable meaning, he couldn't even recognize all the characters, at most he could only tell you that the madman in the madman's diary was "very interesting," that's all.</p>
<p>The second kind of antique figure is to underestimate the children too much, thinking that children are still wet behind the ears, what novels or "idle books" do they want to read? Just memorize the textbooks, at most when the children are bored or naughty, they will find a few Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods and throw them to them, saying casually: "Don't make noise, watch Sun Wukong and Jiang Taigong fight, it's very interesting," so the children really immerse their thoughts in absurd and magical novels, unaware of the Han Dynasty, no matter Wei Jin, like smoking opium.</p>
<p>There are also some enlightened parents who plan for their children every day, running to bookstores and book stalls, busy all day long, but the results they get are extremely pitiful. When they have finished reading the only few excellent children's books in the country, such as Biao, Documents, Scarecrow, and Adventures of Pinocchio, they have to retreat and seek the next best thing. When the "next best" is exhausted, the parents are disheartened and feel that their responsibilities have been fulfilled, so they simply don't ask about "children's affairs" anymore, letting the children go to the garbage dump and pick out whatever treasures they can and enjoy whatever they can, so we can also greatly discover this group of blind children riding blind horses at the stall.</p>
<p>As for the education of poor children, because there are many discussions, I will temporarily omit it here.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above points, although they all focus on the lack of proper and reasonable guidance for children, the problem of children's book shortage is mutually increasing and decreasing with it. Good guidance can reduce the reverse effect of books, and good books can naturally make the guides understand the truth and be easy to engage in. Therefore, we first hope that the family fears correct their own distorted children's concepts, treat children as people with children's characteristics, - that is to say, they can only read books and articles written by children. And need appropriate instructions, this responsibility should be borne by parents: Secondly, we hope that cultural workers will consider more for the children, take out some time, write and translate several more living and beautiful books, as a gift to the War of Resistance to give to them, not only save parents a lot of trouble, that is, in the future this group of children grow up will also be grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Eastern River Frontline <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Written by the Guangdong Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team</p>
<p>(III) Bearing the Arduous Task of Responsibility</p>
<p>A very unfortunate phenomenon occurred here. Before even reaching Heyuan—the first stop on the Eastern River—most of the comrades were plagued by illness. In this difficult and materially lacking team, the lack of medicine and nutrition particularly intensified the suffering of the sick. At this stage, we not only had to take on the responsibility of resisting Japan, but also had to engage in a struggle against the demons of disease. As a result, although the demons of disease were driven out of our territory, our meal money was swallowed up by them. The entire team's finances were at their most depleted. Magistrate Huang of Heyuan County showed us great care and help, allowing sick comrades to be admitted to local hospitals for treatment and also solving the food and clothing problem for some of our comrades.</p>
<p>In Heyuan, we began to take on the heavy burden of our work. One-third of the comrades were assigned to various district self-defense corps to take on political training work. At the same time, a mobile propaganda team from the Anti-Japanese Vanguard appeared in the crossroads of Heyuan City, performing street plays. They appeared gaunt and pale, singing desolate and tragic songs of exile, which moved the onlookers, who all thought they were genuine refugees. So, they generously threw copper coins and banknotes on the ground to help the refugees. We then sent this money to the refugee shelter.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the comrades continued to advance eastward, stopping for ten days in Guzhu Lu, Zijin. Guzhu has a revolutionary tradition and a history of great struggle. Although the atmosphere had been quiet for a long time, our arrival stirred up their enthusiasm like a raging tide.</p>
<p>Just as we were working vigorously and intensely, news suddenly came that Huizhou had been recovered. This certainly made us rejoice, but in Huizhou, which had been ravaged by the [Japanese] invaders, how devastated and chaotic would it be? How much it needed people to work! So, we had no choice but to leave the enthusiastic youth of Guzhu and advance towards Huizhou.</p>
<p>Indeed, we were so bound by their enthusiasm that we could not bear to leave them idle. We decided to leave five comrades to continue working for ten days and added more than thirty new Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades, establishing the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Zijin Guzhu Lu Unit.</p>
<p>The boat slowly sailed eastward, with people on the shore and on the boat responding to each other. Farewell, farewell comrades, we will meet again on the front line—songs shattered the morning air. The people seeing us off went one step and then another, one mile and then another. This enthusiastic expression of the Guzhu youth was, more than for us, for the country and its people!</p>
<p>Facing the ancient city of Huizhou, trampled by the iron hooves of the [Japanese] invaders, it was already scarred beyond recognition. The only Dongxin Bridge spanning the Eastern River, connecting the two sides of the county seat, had been crippled and fallen into the raging Eastern River. This was the souvenir left by the [Japanese] invaders when they left. The prosperous commercial district! Shuidong Street, had become a rubble field. The charming West Lake was covered in a layer of greyish-purple color, and the evening breeze carried a fishy and foul smell. The beauty of the lake and mountains had faded, and Xizi (West Lake) was indeed ashamed to be seen. All of this humiliation, the Eastern River with its revolutionary tradition! Why didn't you show a little of your true colors? Xizi, why didn't you exert your spirit and allow the brutal human demons to ravage you at will? Facing the humiliated West Lake, the masses who were slaughtered in large numbers, and the remains of the buildings that were burned down, ignited a heart-rending fire of anger in them!</p>
<p>Driving away the [Japanese] invaders and cleaning up the broken mountains and rivers to rebuild is what we are willing to do and must do. Now the comrades are scattered in the army to work. Training young people, mobilizing the masses to participate in guerrilla warfare, and strengthening the political training work of the army are the work we have done and continue to do. The enemy's retreat from Huizhou this time clearly shows that they do not have enough troops to allocate. It is very likely that they will return to counterattack. How should we prepare, strengthen the people's strength, expose the enemy's political conspiracies, and give them a head-on blow when the enemy turns around? The Eastern River is in such an important position.</p>
<p>In the past three months of work, although the Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades have done their best, it cannot be denied that the Anti-Japanese Vanguard has many weaknesses. In particular, the lack of cadre talents is a factor that makes it difficult to carry out work. We hope and sincerely welcome enthusiastic young people to join our ranks, to jointly take on and develop our arduous task of responsibility. We also hope that comrades working in various places will give us more instructions and help in our work. The Anti-Japanese Vanguard is a small child hiding in a corner and needs so much cultivation and guidance!</p>
<p>Sent from Huizhou City on the 26th of the first month, the 28th. (The End)</p>
