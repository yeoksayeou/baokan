<h3 id="c1">對蘇僞邊境新衝突的認識 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨晚日方及外訊皆傳蘇聯與偽滿的邊境三日上午又發生嚴重的衝突，雙方開砲對擊歷數小時之久；日方且謂：蘇方大舉進攻，現雙方尙在對峙中，情勢極爲嚴重，「滿境守軍且有多人受傷。當此蘇日漁約糾紛因日方之屈服暫吿一段落的時候，蘇僞邊境又發生如是重大衝突，一波方平，一波又起，並且日方旣巳對蘇聯屈服，何以又於此時濫啓糾紛，在一般人看來，或甚費解，但這是必然的新傾向，其間的根本原因及內在的矛盾，有加深刻認識的必要。</p>
<p>日本在蘇日漁約的解决上，固然忍受了軍略上，政治上，以至經濟上的損失，實是對蘇聯的一種屈服，但是日本對蘇的屈服不是誠意的永久的屈服，所以蘇日的糾紛並不能因爲漁約的暫時解决而得完全消滅。日本在蘇日新漁約的簽訂上忍受了二十七處漁區及三十萬日元新租費的損失，還是其次的問題，而其政治上的損失，却是一種嚴重的問題。它不能向國際表示對蘇屈服，所以繼漁約糾紛之後，掀起另一種新的糾紛。這種不斷的蘇日糾紛，一方而旣可以向德意表示它依然在準備進攻蘇聯，增加德意對日的友誼，阻止德意對中國或能的援助，如最近所傳德國將供中國一部分軍火及經濟的援助；另一方面還可以欺騙英法，說它並沒有放棄充當資本主義國家進攻社會主義國家急先鋒的任務，阻止英蘇親密關係與美蘇親密關係的增進。</p>
<p>從這次蘇僞新衝突的經過，可以證明日本確有上述的用意。日方雖然發表蘇「滿」發生新衝突事件，是因爲蘇聯乓士二十三人侵入「滿」境，並向防軍開火，把戰端的責任推在蘇聯身上，但是哈爾濱外訊所傳消息，却實是日僞兵先向蘇聯防軍發砲挑釁，後來蘇聯援軍開到，始開砲還擊。當此慕索里尼繼希特勒吞併整個捷克及一部份立陶宛並向東歐各小國威脅之後發動吞併阿爾巴尼亞以威脅英國的陰謀的時候，又當英國對蘇關係日益好轉，最近有派參謀總長赴蘇的打算，並且一面企圖組織反侵略集團，一面加緊訓練機械化部隊，並與法國磋商切實聯防的今日，德意侵略者自然要求東方的帮兇，啓發蘇日事件，牽制蘇聯在歐洲的積極行動。上述德國供給中國軍火及信用的消息之散出，卽其事實的證明，日本旣不能放棄德意兩個帮兇，自然要有所表示。日本元老重臣及穩健派雖然極力反對德意日三國軍事同盟的締結，但是日本軍部及法西斯政黨，還是要維持三國的密切關係，增進更積極的合作的。</p>
<p>在這次蘇僞邊境的衝突上。還可以看出更重要的一種事實，就是日本內部矛盾的尖銳化。元老，重臣，財界，乃至一部分穩健派軍人，雖然主張對蘇緩和。但是少壯派軍人則以其擴大事件，藉以騙取軍費，鎭壓反戰主張的必要性而須不斷地發動對蘇的挑戰行動。上次蘇日漁約糾紛之能够早日結束，据傳完全由於元老，重臣，乃至一部軍人及財界有力者極力主張的結果，少壯派軍人則非常不服，甚至有主張立刻對蘇作戰論的人。少壯派當中態度最强硬而且不服政府指令的，是駐紮國外的部隊，特別是陸軍部分。所以在政府簽訂蘇日新協定未及週日，蘇偽邊境糾紛又繼之以起。同時還可以看出陸軍對海軍的暗鬥。近來海軍的活動比較積極，陸軍方面誠恐軍的指導權旁落，或甚至爲海軍所奪，故始終不肯放鬆自己的積極及擴大的行動。</p>
<p>蘇日的新糾紛正在開端，昨日的嚴重衝突尙未停停止，此後的進展正堪注意。惟是這一問題不是蘇僞的問題，也不只是蘇日兩國的問題，從上面的剖述，可知確是超越遠東範圍的帶有國際性的問題。所以不但中國要深加注意，卽英美法，特別是東歐各國，更應該加以深切的者慮和積極的準備。</p>
<h3 id="c2">保持和發揚　新四軍的優良傳統 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 項英將軍講　何　為紀錄</p>
<p>記　有個機會，晤見新四軍副軍長項英將軍，承他對我作了極有系統的談話。記者把這有價值的談話記下來，但未經項將軍本人看過，如有不妥或錯誤，皆由記者負責，茲錄其言論如下：記者附記</p>
<p>抗日戰爭，正在堅持戰鬥中，這一戰爭，關係民埃的解放，决定民族的生存。當前的侵略者，是具有近代裝備的。要戰勝這一兇暴的侵略者，必須動員一切力量，團結一切力量，尤須要超羣卓絕，富有最堅强戰鬥力的軍隊，才能在持久戰中爭取最後勝利，使中華民族得到眞正的解放。</p>
<p>日本是依於×國主義的經濟基礎，在軍事上迭成對菴的優勢，企圖以這優勢來滅亡中國。但是日本是×國主義中最弱的一個，無論在政治經濟等條件上，均不能支持長　戰爭，不能在長期中保持對我優勢：這是决定了日本在持久戰中必然失敗的一個基本因素。</p>
<p>同時，歷史上仟何革命軍隊，開始時不能獲得優良的裝備，形成劣勢對抗優勢，遂漸由劣熱轉爲優勢，而將×人最後殲滅。主要由於革命軍隊，他依靠正確的領導與廣人的民衆，最高度的革命熱忱，堅强的意志與忠勇的犧牲精神，以造成最堅强的戰鬥力。能克服一切困難，逐漸增强自己，達到最後勝利。抗日戰爭旣是革命的戰爭，我們又是革命軍隊，能够繼承和發展一切革命軍隊的傳統，不僅能進行持久戰，而且能在持久戰中爭取最後勝利。這是我們最後能戰勝日本的一個基本原因。</p>
<p>目前抗戰正過渡到第二階段，是我們從政治，軍事，經注等等條件上，來準備我們反攻的力量。首先政治重於軍事，民衆重於軍隊，精神重於物質，這種準備力的成績如何，是决定最後勝利的其本條件。可是準備的最後的目的是爲要建立最堅强而能戰鬥的優良軍隊，直接来殲滅侵略者，驅逐他們出中國！因此堅强軍隊的戰鬥力，建立與扶大新的軍隊，成爲準備反攻爭取最後勝利的最中心點了。</p>
<p>我們新四軍是產生和生長於長期民族革命鬥爭中，那不僅有了過去爲民族解放的英勇鬥爭歷史，而且創造了，繼承了革命軍隊的許多優良傳統。我們依靠這些優良傳統，構成軍隊驚人的戰鬥力，來克服任何困難成爲不能被人戰勝的軍隊。現在當直接爭取民族解放的抗戰中，我們新四軍應該貢獻一切力量，發揮一切力量，堅　的爲完成自己在抗戰中應有仟務而戰鬥。</p>
<p>我們新四軍，在裝備上說，不但與日本相比，優劣懸殊太甚：而且與一般抗戰友軍相較。也相差很逮。可是參加江南抗戰以來，能够對於抗戰有所貢献，獲得初步的勝利，主要是依靠於長期鬥　中所創造與繼承的革命優良傳統，來構成我軍的特殊戰鬥力；加以長期作戰經驗與靈活運用戰術，故能以最劣勢的武裝對抗優勢的日本，而取得勝利。</p>
<p>我軍的一切優良傳統：是構成我軍戰鬥力的因素。堅强戰鬥力的基礎，使我軍能够以最劣勢武器對抗優勢之×，能够逐漸由劣勢轉　優勢，這是革命軍隊能够最終戰勝×人的基本條件之一。</p>
<p>我軍優良傳統是什麽？總括一句，是我軍的各種新的制度與新的創作精神，新的戰鬥和作風。有些是繼承歷史上革命軍隊的傳統，大部是我們在觀苦戰鬥中所創立的，經過無數次的經驗而把她訂爲新的制度。造成新的戰鬥作風，養成新的工作精神，這機把她保持和發揚起來。</p>
<p>現在我們具體的來解說優良傳統的內容：</p>
<p>一、官兵平等友愛團結</p>
<p>凡是革命軍隊無分官兵，政治上的目的是一致的不是以官階分貴賤，更不是以生活好壞作區別；不過因能力大小，責任不同，實行分工以進行部隊的戰鬥。大家旣是同志，就能萬衆一心的把部隊團結得像一個人一樣，造成戰無不勝攻無不克的力量。</p>
<p>我們新四軍，不僅是革命軍隊，幷且是從革命鬥爭中產生的，生長的，經通長期革命戰爭的鍛鍊而壯大起來的。在政治上說，我們新四軍，一貫來爲了中華民族解放和社會解放卽戰鬥，也可以說，是中國革命運動的產兒。</p>
<p>正由於這　，我們新四軍，繼承了革命軍隊的精神，而且發揚了這種精神：『官兵平等友愛團結』，就是這種精神的具體化，實際化。</p>
<p>爲什麽要「官兵平等」？因爲革會軍隊，是革命份子所組成。參加，隊的人，不是爲了薪餉，也不是爲了官位，而是爲了民族解放和社會解放的事業而鬥爭！所以官兵應實行「平等」不能　解爲「平均」，只有實行「官兵平等」，才能團結全軍軍决戰鬥到底。</p>
<p>爲什麽要「友愛團結」？政治意志相同的人稱同志，同志與同志應友愛，才能親密互助：團結就是力量，團結愈固力量也　愈强。戰爭是力量對比，要戰勝×人，必須力量强過×人。要力量强大，必須要團結。所有找們新四軍的指戰員，工作員，應實行友愛，應團結一致，這樣才能使全軍上下一致同心，同息難，共甘苦，造成　一般的鬥戰力</p>
<p>我們怎樣實行「官兵平等友愛團結？」（甲）部隊中都是革命的同志，只有工作七的分工，無貴踐之別。不准有誰侮辱誰的話，誰　視誰的態　，誰壓迫誰的舉動，互相間無嚴格的界限區別。（乙）生活與待遇，官兵是一樣，如火食費一樣多，而且一樣吃，不准有小廚房和特別吃好。服裝是一　，官兵共甘苦，要好大家好，有苦大家吃，首長更要以身作則，爲士兵的模範。（丙）官其沒有餉發，只有零用費。有時因經費困難，僅有火食鏟，沒有零用錢。官兵都是一樣，官兵不能單獨有過份的特別亨受。（丁）官與兵，同志與同志，都要互相尊敬，態度要誠懇和靄，說話要坦白和氣。敬禮是互敬，不准上欺下。下凌上，更不准有侮辱和欺壓的舉動。（戊）官兵同志，互相敬愛友善，有疾病相扶持，有患難相扶助，有困難相幫叻，有經驗互相交換，有錯誤互相規勸，不准互相　視對立。（已）上級對下級，要愛護，先士兵後自己。下級對上級，應尊重服從。老戰士　帮助新戰士。</p>
<p>二　政治工作制度</p>
<p>戰爭是政治的繼續，是政治鬥爭最高的一種方式，戰爭本身就是政治鬥爭。</p>
<p>軍隊是政治的武裝鬥爭集團，進行和貫　政治主張最有力的必要工具。全軍隊應有政治領導，因爲政治工作就是保證，革命軍隊的精神與澈底執行政治任務完成政治任務的工作。它是從思想上，生活上，行動上去保證這一軍隊，好像人身的血液一樣。沒有血液與血的營養，人就會死亡。所以政治工作，是革命軍隊的生命綫，沒有它不　不能生長壯大，而且不能生存。</p>
<p>三　與民衆打成一片</p>
<p>軍隊是民衆的武裝，是從民衆與民衆門爭中產生的，生長的，與民衆是一家人，與民衆利害相共。痛癢相關。</p>
<p>一個軍隊，不僅要團結民衆，愛護民衆：而且要代表民衆，保護民衆的軍隊。如魚失掉了水，不單要打敗仗，而且易被消滅。換句話說，軍隊有了民衆　護，就能生存，定能勝利；失了民衆，要失敗，要消滅。</p>
<p>我們新四軍過去與現在一貫來爲民衆利益而奮鬥，事事以民衆的利益爲利益。到處帮助民衆，團結民衆，所以到處得到民衆的信仰和擁護，所以時時在民衆帮助之下有力的戰勝困難，打敗×人。</p>
<p>怎機與民衆打成一片？</p>
<p>一，愛護老百姓成爲我軍三大紀律之一！</p>
<p>二，十項注意中九大項是我們對民衆的紀律，人人要做到，項項要執行：（一）上門板綑稻革，（二）房子掃于凈，（三）說話要和氣，（四）買賣要公平，（五）借物要送還，（六）損失要賠錢，（七）大便找厠所，（八）洗澡　女人，（九）進出要官傳，（十）優待俘虜兵。</p>
<p>我們要和老百姓混合起來。</p>
<p>四　艱苦奮鬥堅持到底</p>
<p>中國軍隊是爲達到民族自由獨立的目的而鬥爭，不達到目的，决不停止鬥爭。只有鬥爭，堅决鬥爭到底，才能　到最後的目的。即或遭受打擊，　下一個人還是要堅持鬥爭，妥協，就　對革命動搖：對×人屈服，投降，是革命的叛徒，可恥的罪人。</p>
<p>我們新的軍不長任何困難，只要能戰勝×人仟何苦都要吃，任何　　能耐艱苦奮鬥，是我們銀鍊的傳統精顧神吃得苦，耐得勞，是我們的本領。</p>
<p>我們經過了無數的困難遭受了無數的困苦，爲忠實於民族和社會的解放事業而鬥爭，至死不屈。　作英勇鐵牲，决不苟延殘喘，遺，我們鬥爭的精神。</p>
<p>五，自我犧牲英勇奮鬥</p>
<p>革命要犧牲才能戰鬥，戰爭要犧牲才能勝利，犧牲了自己，才能挽救民族，解放民衆。不能犧牲的人，不　稱為軍人，英勇犧牲，是軍人的本色，是軍人的光榮事業。</p>
<p>我們新四軍爲抗×救國，爲解放民衆，在過去作了最英勇的犧牲，到現在仍在犧牲奪鬥！</p>
<p>六、自覺的遵守紀律</p>
<p>軍隊沒有紀律，就要瓦解消滅。紀律是保證軍隊的行動一致，維持軍隊的生活規律，結果軍民的關係，　鞏固與堅強部隊戰鬥力的原素。誰的軍隊紀律好，雖的戰鬥力强，誰就有把握的戰勝×人。紀律的好壞，就是軍隊好壞的標準，所以軍隊要有　　的紀律，　人要嚴格的遵守紀律。</p>
<p>軍隊戰勝×人，主要的不决定武器的優良，而决定於軍隊的英勇犧牲，勇敢善戰，團結民衆，上下齊心，尤須有　的紀律。</p>
<p>「什麽叫做自覺的遵守紀律？」</p>
<p>普通的軍隊多是以强制方法要人遵守維持　的紀律，如强制力量不强，紀律也隨之鬆懈。因爲遵守紀律的人。不是自願的自動的，而是被强迫的，所以常常發現陽奉陰違，瞞上不瞞下的現家。這種紀律獻不能鞏固，更不能維持長久。</p>
<p>所謂「自覺的遵守紀律」，換句括說，大家懂得紀律的　要，自動　遵守紀律。不要在　制方式下，被迫而遵守紀律，也小是有了監視才遵守紀律，面是隨時隨地都是自動遵守，使守紀律成爲一種自然的行動，把犯紀律認爲自己罪過的行爲。</p>
<p>七、絕對廢除肉刑和打罵制度</p>
<p>肉刑是封建　代統治者對付被壓迫者主人對奴隷的殘酷手段。稍稱文明社會和開明的軍隊，都不採用這種封建的刑法來管理社會和軍隊。只有封建軍閥的軍隊，或者保存封建殘餘很重的軍隊，管理士兵用肉刑（如打軍棍打手掌等）。這種刑法等於把士兵當作奴　對待，革命的軍隊絕對不准許有這種刑法的存在。</p>
<p>我新四們軍自建立以來，就澈底慶除肉刑，絕對禁止打人罵人。誰要施用肉刑，不但受紀律的嚴厲制裁，而且遭受全體指揮員戰　員的反對與打擊。誰要打人罵人，誰就要受處罰和斥責。不管首長對下級和上兵或者士兵與十兵，軍隊對老百姓，如若違反了這種紀律，都要受制裁。</p>
<p>八、學習政治武裝頭腦不斷提高軍事技術加強戰鬥力</p>
<p>軍事技術是隨着社食經濟的發展與戰爭劇烈的進步而發展。革命軍隊是最進步的軍除，一切求進步，一切要超過於人。革命軍人應當不斷學習軍事，提高軍事技術，以加增自已的戰鬥力。同時不但要會使用自已的武器，而且應努力學習使用×人的武器，以便奪取×人武器以消滅×人，</p>
<p>戰爭的基本原則，是保持自己消滅×人，如何使自己不被×人消滅，又不致與×人同歸於盡，就要依靠自已巧妙的戰術與戰鬭方法，因此更要求革命軍人不斷學習軍事，提高軍事技術。</p>
<p>我們新四軍每個官兵　當都了解政治，學習政治。政治生活是生活的主腦，一切從政治上去理解問題，解决問題，遭　我們的特點。</p>
<p>我們軍隊從未經過軍隊的一定的調練和敎育，而　作戰。我們的指揮員從未住過完備的軍事學校，多是由士兵提升，由文人變爲武人，但是能夠戰鬥，而且獲得許多驚人的戰績。</p>
<p>利用一切可能的機會來學習，這機使我們不斷前進，成爲最進步的軍隊。</p>
<p>九，動作敏捷行動機警攻擊勇猛緊張活潑</p>
<p>我們的戰　作風是：（一）動作敏捷。由日常生活　養成敏捷動作，方能在戰鬥時　到動作的敏捷。學習敏捷動作養成敏捷行動，發揚動作的敏捷。（二）行動機警，戰鬥不僅是鬥力，而且是鬥智。誰能巧妙的戰鬥，睢就能克敵致勝。誰能　活利用戰場情况的變化，誰就取得有利的地位，可以威少損失取得更大的勝利。（三）攻擊猛勇。我鬥新四軍不但是政擊精神旺，而且攻擊很猛。只有攻擊猛勇，才能震撼×人的精神，動搖×人的　志，達到白刃解決敵人取得最後勝利。我們的口處是：猛攻！猛衝！猛進！（四）緊張活潑。我們新四軍的生活和工作都是在最緊張中進行。緊張是戰　的精神。一切散漫　懈的現象，都是妨礙工作的進展，影響戰　的進行，有礙勝利的進取。活發才能發展人的自動性，創造性，這種精神發展到戰鬥中，則爲機動性。但活潑不是放浪；而是表示生氣勃勃；不是死板式的機械，更不是胡行亂屬，而是具有組織的有次序的自然動態。</p>
<p>十、奪取×人的武裝來武裝自己</p>
<p>我們軍隊的武器，都是從戰網中所奪取的，因爲我們旣沒有現存的兵工廠製造武器，更不可能大批的購　。只有奪獲入人的武器來武裝自己，　才是我們傳統的本領。因此，爲了奪取武器就要學習戰　，學習　股　中去敵獲×人的槍砲，來充實我們的裝備，加强自己的火力，以便更大的奪取×人的新式武器，把自己造成近代化的軍隊。</p>
<p>我們的武器，都是血　的代價所　來的，因此要保護自己的武器，把武　看作自已的生命一樣。</p>
<p>我們的口號是：</p>
<p>（一）奪取×人的武裝來武裝自巳</p>
<p>（二）用戰鬥的手段敵獲×人的槍跑！</p>
<p>（三）愛護武器同如自己的性命一樣！</p>
<p>（四）武器與生命共存亡！</p>
<p>我號召全軍的指揮員和戰鬥員：保持這些優良傳統，發展這些優良傳統而鬥爭，使新四軍能成爲新的模範的　軍，爲完成最後勝利的在務而抗戰到底。</p>
<p>一切砐　優良傳統的行爲，應該遭受全軍的打擊。一切腐敗的現象和行動，都不允許存在我們的軍隊中，一切　敗份子，要受自然的淘汰！</p>
<p>我重　的號召我軍全體的指戰員爲保持和發揚我軍固有的優良傳統而爭，爲繼承和接受一切革命傳統和進步的精神而努力。這樣才能使我軍日益堅强起來，造成爲抗戰中一支最堅强的軍隊，團結最大的民衆，協同友軍在江南堅持長斯抗戰，凖備反抗，最後，把日本××趕出中國去。</p>
<p>把我們的國旗像傳旗式的由蕪湖，南京，直到上海重新垂揚起來！</p>

<p>（民革社通訊稿）『日本××主義嗎？快了！　崩潰不遠了！』實外的夕陽反映着落日的餘光，一個年靑的，新中國靑年軍人式的蒙古靑年奇丕彰君對記者這樣說。</p>
<p>一九三五年德王名義上還是蒙政曾秘書長，沒有公開投到×人懷抱的時候，爲了訓練爪牙，曾派了幾個蒙古靑年到日本留學。蘆　橋事變後，中國展開了神聖的全面抗戰，這幾個蒙　靑年知眼看到了×人國內的經濟困難，人民　戰情緒的非常高漲，×人士兵傷亡的重大等等現象，一夥不願做媽隸的心和對祖國光明的未來前途的憧　，使他們藉口離開了×人的覊絆。設法回到祖國的懷抱中來了。奇君使是其中的一個，他是對伉戰勝利抱有最大信心的有爲蒙古靑年。</p>
<p>「我是去年秋深回國來的，那時抗戰巳進行了十五個月了。×人是愈戰愈苦悶，不知他的泥足要陷到什麽地方，人民反戰情緒是隨着戰爭滋長；工人罷工，智　份子也都是咀咒戰爭。快了，這些遲早要　發起來，配台上中國的反攻，就是日本××主義者總崩潰的時候了」。他特別着重的說了一句。</p>
<p>「日本兵七的死亡總　五六十萬以上，日本的農村已深感到了壯丁的缺乏去年我在束京村近的一個鄉村避暑，日俄戰爭的時候，那個村子只徵了八個兵，而在我避暑的一個月中，便徵了四十多個壯了，剛上一個月　那樣，以後徵得更不知有多少了，照人民的情緒比起日俄戰爭來，却差的多，不，簡直是相反，已冉看不見日俄戰時父送子，妻送夫上戰塲的熱烈情緒，有的只是出征家人潛然的眼淚</p>
<p>「物價嗎？物　高漲的要命，一盒日本煙以前祇一魚錢，現在却要兩角多錢。吃一頓飯要比從前貴三四倍。熱閙　　如銀座，新　的野鷄汽事快要絕跡了。公共汽車也開得少了。從前大學生中學生穿「下馱」是不准　敎室的。如令，却獎勵穿起「下馱」了。街頭上見的是吃醉酒踉蹌的學生。　淫的野鷄，點綴的　國際　女的「千人針」和　捐。「泥捧一（盜賊）是增多了，人民沒有吃的不搶人怎麽辦辦？」</p>
<p>「日本最缺乏的是棉花，皮革，五金，煤鈇，石油，尤其最缺的是石油，鉄，日本快沒有石油用了。大坂的工廠多半關了門。祇刺下了軍火工廠，就是軍火工廠也快要沒有原料可供給了。失業工人是從來未有的多。罷工，罷工！日本嚴密的警察網雖然　有能力防止人民公開的反戰行動，對干罷工他　是沒有辦法的。」</p>
<p>「　溝橋事變以後，日本已經變成了人民的監獄，整千整千的學生，敎授學者，評論家都被捕了。山川均，黑田米雄也被關在監牢中，祇有和胡適之寫「敬吿中國人民」的室伏高　，還沒有被捕，也常常寫着咀咒戰爭的文章，說日本是侵略者，結果中日兩國「兩收俱傷」，日本的元老重臣和日本人民一樣，都在躭心着這戰爭的何日了結和日本的『將來』。</p>
<p>「自然，驕傲的日人不是沒有的，財閥，軍閥，少　軍人，官史，公務員，他們逞着威風，一心想着征服中國，不管本國的人民憎恨　咀咒，一天天在中國自掘坟墓。」</p>
<p>「外交上日本祇有兩個狼狽爲　的朋友，意大利和德國，他宣傳着說：這次打的不是中國，而是美國和蘇聯，在經濟上打英國，在思想上打蘇聯」</p>
<p>「你囘國来見到德王沒有」？記者見地談日本情况不少了，便掉轉詁頭問他。</p>
<p>「見到的，因爲我是囘到綏遠才逃出來的」。他率直地說了，德王苦悶得很，也苦痛的很　我第一次見他、他還顯着高興的樣子，以爲他　植的學生囘來了、以後每談一次，他都表現出爲人做塊儡的悲哀，他本人想利用日本，不料反發日本利用了，他手下的人，巳沒有了，他的　　，而　成了七八年前車北的老漢奸了，他自己的行動也受着日本人的監視，德王是有點「悔不當初」了。相信德王有一天也會回到祖國的抱懷中來的。</p>
<p>『奇先生的行止』和『工作怎樣』？，記　這樣問了。</p>
<p>「我預備到重慶謁見領袖去，工作是分配我什麽，就幹什麽，衹要是關於抗戰的工作，我都可以做」，他慷慨的說。</p>
<p>辭了奇君出來，聲色已籠罩了四野。望著一樓縷炊煌，我不　快活的想，你可憐的漢奸傀儡，你所培　的「人才」，却都是和至中國的　一个國民一樣，站　爲祖國奮鬥的火綫上來了。</p>

<p>今天，重慶各界正在熱烈舉行「馬相老百齡大慶」。我們敬在這里爲中華民族而祝賀馬相伯老先生的百齡大壽。</p>
<p>『人生七十古來稀』，而馬相伯老先生實際經一百多議了，但我們認爲馬老尙有特別令人祟敬慶賀的，尤其是以下幾點：第一，馬老以中國天主敎徒的老前輩，歷年憲力於敎育事業，首損棄　產，輔助大學敎育，如對復旦震且各校，其作育羣倫發展文化的功績，實足爲全國模範。筎二，馬老以百齡老翁，而居常接近靑年，愛護脅年，並且時慮落伍，因而對於凡百事態，常能力持正義，對於一切進步思潮，及革命學說，尤爲努力推進，對於一切頑固。守　及反革命的言論行動，不惜痛加攻擊，此在今日，尤足爲國家及社會領袖份子忠誠效法。第三，馬老平日努力國事，年來關心尤切，九一八事變以後。迭發停止內戰一致禦侮的呼籲，其後全國救亡運動的展開，抗日民族統一戰綫的形成與鞏固，馬老之功人偉，抗戰展開以來，堅决盡力，不屈不懈；當此抗戰建國進人重要階段之際，尤當學習馬老此種精神，加强團結，堅持抗戰。第四，馬老平　爲祖國竭其忠慮，抗戰以來，秉其堅毅之精神，以百齡老翁轉輾於×人砲火之下，自東戰場歷經日、浙贛湘桂川滇各省，不甘偷生於×奸勢力之下，繼續爲國家民族盡力；並時對中外記者發言，以其老誠謀國之忠忱與經騐，就目　中外大勢，說明我國堅持團結抗戰，必獲最後勝利，對×好×行醜態，痛切指斥，呼籲世界正義人士，誓不與之兩立，對於民族前途、則表示無限樂觀。最後馬老迭次呼籲團結以外，更力主實行民主政治，以爲抗戰勝利保證。故在今日，我們慶祝馬老百齡大壽，同時實為慶祝我民族解放運動指導者的百齡大慶，這是馬老的光榮，也是中華民挨的光榮！</p>
<p>我們祝賀馬老百齡大慶，不能僅是形式的祝賀，我們要祝賀馬老這五種偉大的精神，一致努力，使其發揚光大，獲得成功。同時我們還要以「壽馬老並壽我民族」的實際行動，重慶各界規定以壽儀移充救護傷兵難意損欵，我們應加緊唯進這種光榮的捐欵運勸！我們在這裏遙爲馬老慶祝，我們爲民族革命的領袖及其前途慶祝？</p>
<p>汪精衛何處去？</p>
<p>注精衛氏發表了一篇迎合××侵略者意旨以國××進行××的文章『舉一個例』之後，似乎還曾引起一些反響：一種是愛國人士的義××××××的痛斥，一種是×人的贊許和南北漢奸傀儡的俸場。</p>
<p>本港一般愛護祖國與主持正義的報紙，一致指斥汪氏此文，這種報紙雖然還受漢奸叛徒的及其報紙的無恥誣罵，但爲全體愛護祖國愛護政府和一切止義人七的擁護，就是現爲×××役的，如果尚有一點人性，當亦不能不深自愧疚　，（雖然他們早巳喪失人性，但我們仍仁　　懷，希望他們回復人性！）至於爲汪發衣文章並爲注曲辯亂馬的××日報，其平日言論消息，汙　我的筆墨，再加任何反駁。卽如言仲嗚被殺一事，該報卽首先以引人汴目的『重慶』字樣，試問他們的本心是不是在影射中央？是不是在惡意的故意的引起讀者們的誤會，以為中央眞會幹出這樣無聊的事——以致止中他們的奸計，要不然，他們所指的「重慶」是什麽？要半空拉上「重慶』兩個字又為什麽？一方面故意造謠，一方面又！好在「」你就不向讀者們讀者們亦知道你的意思和伎倆！你</p>
<p>我們仍須注意的是×好對汪的態度。據一日海通社上海電，南北塊儡政權，已在舉命組織僞中央政府，謀以汪爲總理。而四日東京電，則稱日方對汪表示：『吾人雖然完全同意於其觀點，但對其以前宣霄中提出之所謂和平條件，却絕不能滿意，又在目前形勢下，法屬安南之河內，殊非汪氏本人及其和平運動之適當　所』。則又可言巳在示意！歷史是無情的證人，注視汪精衛何處去吧！</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>平凡的奇蹟</p>
<p>年紀輕的不够認議，年紀大了缺乏熱情。最可珍貴的是靑年學生。他們有高度的警覺性與熱烈的感情。自從五四運動迄至現階段的民埃解放鬥爭，靑年學生挖出他們的心，流盡他們的汗與血貢獻於祖國，貢獻於工作，始終是站在最前進，最重要的地　。</p>
<p>學生有組織，表現集體的力量，在國內，這是一椿平凡的事情。在香港却是一個驚人的奇蹟！在民族解放的禮炮轟出來的奇蹟正多着呢，香港學生的組織與怒吼，正是澎湃的時代怒潮中的一支急流吧了。</p>
<p>囘溯事實，該是前年九月廿四日那一天，香港的青年學生不甘自外于祖國，配含着抗戰的需要，遂由港大同學，召集各校代表會議，卽席成立了香港學生賑濟會，幷聘請前港大　監韓尾路爵士爲會長，會督何明華，羅文錦等爲顧問，從此，代表香港近千所大中小學，學生人數共約十萬以上的學生集團，遂在抗戰的炮聲中宣吿成立了。</p>
<p>過去的工作</p>
<p>雖然×人的侵略是很瘋狂的，我們抗戰的炮聲卻給它一個理頭的痛擊；　然香港的　境是特殊的，學賑會的工作却在困難中進行着。檢閱學　會過去十九個月幹過的工作，　大者計有：</p>
<p>第一——關於募捐方面：（一）民國廿六年上日舉行節食節用賑濟　動，獲款四千餘元。（二）廿七年元旦慈善遊藝大會，得欺二千餘元。（三）廿七年二日全港同學三天節食，購置塞衣爾衣運動，得五千餘元。（四）廿七年三月灣仔段換物會，七得欵百餘元。（五）廿七年四月音樂會，籌得欵二千餘元。（六）廿七年四月銅鑼灣段籌欵二百八十餘元。（七）同年「七七」紀念贈旗捐款二千餘元。（八）同年「八一三」献金運動得欵二千餘元，另金器多具。（九）同年「九一八」徵集慰勞品運動，募得藥品罐頭食物數十大箱。（十）同年「十月十日」徵集棉衣運動，得衣七千餘件（十一）廿八年元旦慈善遊藝會，得欵三千餘元，（十二）農歷元旦發動小朋友献紅包運動，得千餘元。</p>
<p>第——其他救國事業則有：（一一）仕七年春天，派出代表五人晉省聯絡各青年團體，並向余法謀司令獻旗，籍表港僑對祖國愛護之熱忱，（二）廿七年夏派出宣傳隊多隊，出發廣東中山，小欖，台山，江門，順德，陳村，大良，容奇，等數作各種救國宣傳，（三）全國學生聯合會在武漢召開第二次全國代表大會時，派出代表四人出席，席間以最多票數獲得選爲大會執行委員，此後更與全國同學取得工作上的聯系。（四）去年七月主席李政耀君代表香港學生。出席世界青年和平大會，沿途作國際宣傳，並與世界學聯及各地援華團體，取得經常聯絡。（五）不久以前爲參加戰地難民服務從事實際的救濟工作，有靑年囘國服務的組織，前後組成四團囘國服務。此外有日常的工作，大會與各段更有救濟班，平民識字班，歌詠祖，座談會，戰劇組，兒童團等組織。</p>
<p>現在的槪況</p>
<p>學賑會的負責人常對記者說：「我們的能力還是非常簿弱，熱望各校前進敎帥伸出熱烈的手幫助我們」！盧心　懇的態度溢於言表；然而，在沙澳似的得港學運，能有這般收種已經是難能可貴了。再就會員的學校單位來說，亦由數十，數百，到如今巳增加到將近六百個學校單位了。</p>
<p>現在該會第二屆執委任期己滿，經於本月二日在靑年會召開各校代表大會，選舉第三屆職員，並將其章程根據過去的體驗，修改一新。現在的組織概况就是：</p>
<p>代表大學由每學校單位派出代表二人組織而成，爲最高的權力機關。監委七人組織監委會，執委四十三人組織執委會，都是由代表大會產生的。常委會由執委會選舉十五人連大會正副主席共十七人組織的。常委會內分籌募，宣傳，秘書，組織，生活共五部。每部設部長一人副部長二人。</p>
<p>在執委會之下，還有兩區區委會，由各區學校選出九人組織之，內分總務，組織，宣傳服務等四部。區委會以下，就是段委會，再下就是校委會。校藝委會就是學賬會的構成單位。</p>
<p>經常執行學賑會的工作不消說是當委會。常委會之秘書部分有文書，事務，財政三股。組織部設有：計劃股，調查股，女學團，兒童團，宜傳部設有：出版，歌詠，戲劇，及海外宣傳四股。籌募部設有：籌捐，稽核，募物三股。生活部設有：圖書，學術，旅行，體育四股。支持會務進行的會費是每學期向各校徵收一次的，計小學一元，中學二元，大學五元。</p>
<p>今後的安排</p>
<p>該會於本月二日從代表大會選出執監委會之後，復於昨晚七時在該會會所舉行第三屆第一次執委會議，出席者有香港大學李政耀，嶺南大學朱竹友，廣州大學夏傑華，南洋商學院謝漢傑，華夏學院謝裕德，英皇書院　民悅等四十二校代表，及林家曉，鄭之煥，石爲恒諸君，濟濟一堂，是全港各校學生領袖的携手，是學運統一戰線的象徵。</p>
<p>主席港大代表李政躍君，行禮如儀復，主席及各位代表皆有詳盡的報吿，旋推舉常委會各部負實人，結果是，正主席香港大學，剔華夏學院。秘書部止部長廣州大學，副英皇書院，仿林中學，宣傳部正部長嶺　大學，　華，分校，皇仁中學，組織部正部長金險中學，副華僑中學，民生書院，籌募部正部長華仁分校，副聖士提反女校，華南中學，生活部正部長國民大學，副信修女中，廣大女中。——公俟們從此負起神聖的任務了。</p>
<p>按照該會會章有行政顧問會之設，經全體通過，被聘請的顧問是：</p>
<p>黃敦涵，　德超，吳涵眞，林浩彬，岑醴賢，蘇若惠，陳鐵一，李佩嗚，潘靜修，周冠勤，胡橋馨，葉若超，鄭小蘇。鄭之煥，僑敎會內派出三位先吿，東區敎聯會派出二位先生。深願顧問先生的經驗與靑年學生的熱情，　開着着工作的花朵。關於今後工作的綱要，　過熱烈的討論，結果决定：</p>
<p>一，加緊賑濟工作；</p>
<p>二，强化國際宣傳工作；</p>
<p>三，加强各同學自我敎育；</p>
<p>四，注意同學生活與利益；</p>
<p>五，與師長及各社團更密切地聯系；</p>
<p>六，開展校內工作；</p>
<p>七，動員全港學生參加學賑會工作</p>
<p>八，權續發動服務團囘國服務。</p>
<p>還有一點値得我們重視的，就是像通去兒童團的方式，再來一個女學團的號召。由前進的女同學，發動那些只　『讀書書』，不願參加團體活動與救國　作之中小學校女同學。不消說，這是針對着環境的需要饒有意義的偉大工作，我們掬其至誠盼望其計劉實現。</p>
<p>昨晚十時許，記者列席該會議，趕囘報館寫稿時，他們仍然像家人那樣親密，熱烈討論會務的發展。香港有這般靑年，香港學運是有希望的，中華民族有這般兒女，前途是光明的。謹於文末，敬祝年靑的朋友，親密携手，共同發展，切切實實地照安排了的工作苦幹下去！</p>

<h3 id="c52">難民營裏： <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 憧景</p>
<p>本港衛生司司徒永覺，照例每　星期一次報吿本港政府各難民營中難民數目，但除了人數有增减之外，別的事情可看不出了，這個報吿可算是像新聞欄裏的　日訊潮差不多，如在什麽時候漲，又在什麽時候退，好像沒有甚麽別的關連似的！</p>
<p>但，難民營一天天在建設之道邁進　住在裏面的人，初時帶着憂　心境而來，到今天慢慢的到今天，他們憂鬱漸漸消散，他們白天做工，念書，打球，過着很有秩序的生活了。</p>
<p>這些難民營是交由緊急難民救濟會瞥理的，那裏，有三個小組委員會負專責管理　中一切事情，卽是工業，敎育，和糧食委員會，我打算根據這三個項目，接在衛生司每週報吿下面，報道營中一般情形。</p>
<p>這裏先講工業，這然是手工業，別其種類。約有車衣，掃帚，木器，織蓆及紡織等；最近工業委員會，預算用二三千元在京士柏建築一座工場，前個月，該會派梁女士去看過一間毛巾廠，後来把購買四架機關設毛由廠的預算報吿出来，委員會决議先建好工廠，才着手辦理哩。以京士柏一營來講，目下雖然有一架衣軍，但他們爲着慶說四四兒童節，在兩個星期之間特縫製一百五十件難童襯衫，使小朋友們快快樂樂過他們的兒童節。馬頭涌營，也和京士柏一樣，現在加緊趕造竹帚癸帚，北涌營則織造籐器。</p>
<p>敎育方面，馬　涌營計有小童二百三十名，其中一百六十五人是像普通學校裏小朋友們受着初級敎育，現在計劃使他們全體都能够受敎，並以目前祗有一個敎員，决定增聘一個，但京士柏營，有二百個難童尙待敎育，原因是缺乏敎員之故、可是速寫班最開近課了。</p>
<p>敎育委員會在兒童節那天，為難兒備置些什麼呢？是。在京士柏馬頭涌和北角三個營裏，都分別舉行一個盛大的慶祝會，音樂話劇　齊備了。</p>
<p>至于難民的糧食，這裏似乎沒有甚麼可以報告，他們每天都有兩飯，但營養如何，實在難說了。</p>

<p>— 林廣進</p>
<p>三、抵達了潮安</p>
<p>休息的一天過去了、我們又繼績向目的地推進、穿過了豐順、橫過了揭陽、迨到達潮安巳又是跑了四天的路程了、</p>
<p>朱被×人殘踏及姦淫過的潮安、還是非常的天眞與活潑、莊嚴的房子依舊是完整地巍立在人們的眼前、街頭上人們的噪雜聲、商店及公司裏頭的買賣聲、工廠裏面的機器聲、馬路上疾馳着的汽車聲、聯合呼出了都市的繁榮與熱鬧、這使由淪陷區裏跑出來的人們看見了、深深地感到在祖國懷抱裏的兒女及土地、是何等的自由與幸福、是何等的可愛和繁華、而又增加其多少對×人的仇恨。及打回老家去的雄心呢、</p>
<p>然而、在祖國遭遇着空前難危的時候、侵在　的作狂潮傾勢而來的當中、潮安巳受到×人炮火的威脅、幷聞到濃烈的火藥氣息了、同時也其和他的地方一樣、時遭兇狂×機的空襲、不能再過平靜的生活了、</p>
<p>火車站前面的房屋、已深深地印下了許多的疤痕、這是×機賜給潮安人的永久紀念、然而、侵略者的瘋狂、祇能驚醒潮安兒女們甜密的夢、並不能摧毀他們反抗的心、試看一羣一羣的靑年男女、巳熱烈地高舉他們反抗的手、發出了不願做奴隷的吼聲、</p>
<p>他們的血是沸熱的、這熱沸的血、旣曾寫下了光榮的史實、亦將劃下時代的偉韻、</p>
<p>在以前、此地的靑年曾組織成許多的隊伍，隨着軍隊到前線去、英勇地爲民族者艱苦的鬥爭、給予後方民衆精神上　上的鼓勵、現在在、「我們要隨軍殺×」的呼唱、又再度喧囂起来、而月事實上巳有許多熱情的男女同志、跑到國軍的陣營裏、與英勇的抗×將士共同爲祖國的自由而奮鬥了、他們不是爲了升官、更不是爲了發財、而是爲了抗拒法西的侵略、爲了民挨的自由解放而抗爭、</p>
<p>此地的靑年是熱烈的、而且也是勇敢的、這裏可從他們的工作中看得出來、這是應該　揚與讀頌的、不過、他們過去的工作是未曾深入到大衆去、其次是未能準確的運用、他們實實在在的沒有切實廣泛地發動大量的靑年參加工作、更沒有發動全縣的民衆實院起來參加抗戰、同時沒有特別要求工作的準確性、常引起許多對內對外不必要的磨擦、及遭遇許多悲慘的敎訓、這是一件無可贖償的損失！</p>
<p>潮安的動員民衆工作還是未能廣泛的開展、是一件不可否認的事實、這固然一方面是潮安的一般靑年工作同志做的工作不够、及未够大衆化、但另一方面當地的黨都、政府沒有作積極性的政治的領導、亦是其中一個决定的原因、</p>
<p>以上所指出的弱點、完全是客觀存在着的事實應該急急地想法子去克服、勿讓它延續或擴大下去、不然是很可能演成嚴重的危機、惠陽從前的失陷、一方面雖則另有其他原因、但這弱點的存在、亦是具一顯著的結、以致全縣民衆不徘廣汎的動員起來、發揮其偉大力量抵抗侵略、捍守鄉土、弄到×人豋陸時徬徨無措、結果不但未能予×人嚴重的打擊、亦他不釗×人相當的代價、而且演成一幕一幕的慘劇——不知多少的同胞橫遭殺戮、×！這眼前血一般的敎訓、是我們永遠不能忘記的、而今天的潮安兒女們、　着這血紅的敎訓、是應該如何地有所警惕呵、</p>

<h3 id="c62">好萊塢各公司　努力競攝戰事片 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>西班牙戰事、中日戰事、整個在世界充滿了火藥氣味環境之中、好萊塢的影片公司、最近正在競攝戰事鉅片、</p>
<p>在影城之中、近來多數的攝影場裏、有着刀槍聲響、呈現出戰事緊張情狀、女明星、眼睛上發了薄荷腦、這樣、男主角出征的時候、在笑容之中、眼淚會很自然的流落下來、每一部戰事片、都是這樣、</p>
<p>現在、好萊塢是在　製所有能攝的影片、等到派拉蒙的Invasion一片攝成之後、甚至可使我們發現一種暴露掠奪的影片、</p>
<p>當葛列斐斯拍攝The　Birth　of　Nation一片時、爲了戰事的鏡頭、曾耗去不少費用、但現在各公司所攝的戰片、比那時所付的費用還要多、臨時的軍人、每天拍戲的代價、是美金十元五角、租借槍械、每千枝租費五十元、</p>
<p>在柴納克的攝影場裏、Gone　With　The　Wn一片的戰爭的鏡頭、早巳在開拍了、火燒亞特蘭特的一幕、是非常偉大、而這些戰爭的鏡頭、都是用導演手法拍攝、內中有一部分、是非常富麗的、</p>
<p>好來場有一位斯丹保琪、藏有不少軍械、就在派拉蒙影片公司要面、他也收藏着不少所有自古以來的軍器、各影片公司攝製戰事片需要軍器時、就向他出租金租借、最近需要激增、他就大發其財、</p>
<p>因爲最近各公司的攝競戰事片，斯丹保琪出租軍器、經大忙而特忙起來。有時一片中，需要二百五十枝奧國式來福槍，而所需的我國式步槍、也同樣的多、他同時還在這些槍裏、裝好無彈火藥、彈壳的裏面，裝着黑色而發火的彈樂、它們在白天或夜晚拍戲應用是不同的、</p>
<p>基至在Union　Paciffe一片中，雖然並不是眞正的戰事片、佐麥蓋所率領的人抵擋印第安人的暴動時、用了二百十枝來福搶、而那些暴徒、爲的拿着一八六三年前時的舊步槍而蒙不利、向樣、在Heritge　of　hooDesert一片中、有一個現頭、用五十枝步槍、</p>
<p>斯丹保琪最大的一筆生意、那是要供給幾百枝斯賓裴爾特式新槍和所有收藏的機關槍、但高射砲和重砲發生了問題、政府方面、雖可帮忙、可是、一部分軍器、至少要由影片公司設計、雖不是正式作戰、也要使人獲得深刻的印象、華納開拍Juarez一片時、戰爭的鏡頭，將在勃爾彭地方拍攝、他們有四百枝老式步槍、和若干新式槍、巳够作此片的背景了、</p>
<p>由埃洛非林主演的Dodge　City一片、需要一百枝笨重的舊式槍、和若千短口徑手槍、但所有的不到此數、所以一般臨時演員的不是實地作戰者、都拿橡膠製的假槍、</p>
<p>斯丹保琪的軍械庫中、所有英國製李曼爾福式槍、一共有四百六十枝、最近每天在卡車裝到雷電華去供給The　Light　That　Failed一片中所有戰爭的　願拍攝時取用。</p>

<p>二個月前、當『雪姑七友傳』在荷蘭首都開映時觀衆極爲擁擠、但那邊的電影檢查會却禁止十四歲以下的兒童參觀、理由是「片中的恐怖場面足　兒童心理感受不良影響」、爲了這緣故、雷電華當局曾在事前向該片製作人華德狄期耐徵求意見、想把這些所謂『恐怖場面』刪掉、但是華德狄斯　很堅决的拒絕了、他說、『我寧可犧牲一部份的觀衆、不願使全體觀衆看到不眞實而殘缺不全的東西』、於是荷蘭的兒童沒有機會看這影片了</p>
<p>最近、曾有大批美國影片在義大利遭受禁映、其中有二部、一是『法宮艷后』、一是「馬可孛羅遊記」、也在禁映之列、這許多影片的情節和內容、都沒有開罪義大利之處、僅僅是在一段影片中有描寫義大利人吃通心粉的鏡頭、義大利的電影檢查會認爲含有諷刺員味、就不問靑紅皂白、對於有同類描寫的影片、都一律禁映了、</p>
<p>德義兩國的排擠猶太人民、在最近幾個月裏、鬧得不亦樂乎、不料現在又想侵犯好萊場的猶太演員、不久以前、羅馬的法西期黨機關報『特佛拉』日報曾向他們的國民說、凡是卓別　、馬克斯兄弟和李滋兄弟主演的滑稽影片、因爲他們全是猶太人、所以他們的作品必定下流、義大利人民應該抵制、</p>
<p>派拉蒙聯美和環球三影片公司聯合在西班牙攝製的戰事新聞片『琪德里和西班牙」、從前年一直拍攝到現在、巳經有了十二萬尺、最近决定重加整理和剪接、去蕪存精、分爲上中下三集、分發各國開映、</p>

<p>……瑪琳黛德麗……</p>
<p>瑪琳黛德麗、是好萊塢的大明星、也是德國女優中最負有國際聲譽的一個、當六年前希持勒發出「僑居國外的電影明星和技術家全部歸國、在祖國拍片」的命令時、她也就囘到德國、第二天、希特勒派專使前往訪問、傳述他的一番厚意、並對她說、「德意志張臂歡迎你、而且巳爲你備下了一個優越的地位，仟命你爲德國的電影總裁」、瑪琳黛德　僅淡淡的囘答一聲、『謝謝』希特勒爲愛護起見、從第三天起、每天派人向黛德麗致送鮮花、但二個月後、送花的專使忽然將花退給希特勒、原來黛德曁因爲不慣這種生活、已在上一天晚上悄然啓稈囘好萊塢了、</p>

<h3 id="c66">星華隊犯港最後一役　一比零壓倒華聯　星華隊是日出場者多新將　華聯常取攻勢不幸而失敗 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>星社中華足球隊、昨日下午五時半、在加路迎山球場第三次出　攻華聯、昨日天氣突寒、又非假期、到場觀戰者、寥寥無綫、香港督　富國爵士、特于是日　臨參觀「壓軸戲、」一看我國星僑能手、</p>
<p>星華上陣球員、與前稍異、門將改用張惠文、左衛爲經驗老將鄧約翰、右翼爲吳占士、右　龍歷武缺場、由夏治祥補上、吳　士及鄧約　兩人、皆有佳妙演出、鄧氏以　路　熟見署、央氏以傳遞　捷見長、門將馮惠文、身手不錯、但比李柏棠較　一籌、「新李惠堂」謝慶福、昨日得吳占士之助、射進一球、終以一比零之紀鍾、擊敗華聯、</p>
<p>統觀星華×場比賽、每覺全隊進展遲沒、打法陳　、推源溯流、皆由球員盤　過多所致、現代戰術、莫不採用快傳快遞、抄勁衝刺之打法、包囘憶英旅哥靈登什　之表演、可以爲訓、哥靈登隊員于戰爭中、皆　獲取球兒最大目的、從而輾轉遞交于本隊球員、一有機會、卽行衝刺或命射、南華各員自經孩次切磋以後、即效法哥靈登之M式陳綫、去屆南華華能利用　種戰略、奪獲聯賽冠軍、本屆全港勁旅、　多採此項戰略、成績猛進、星華前鋒、有包抄而無衝刺、以致最後一脚、每爲對方所制、同時星華前鋒之射門術、未臻化境、遠射旣不　中的、近射又失目標、故首戰南華時、以零比三而見負、常日星華可得必勝機會者、有數次之多、祇因經驗不充、遲緩失去、殊為可惜、</p>
<p>昨日之役，比首吹兩場較有進步、考星華之勝，由於前衛綫不受牽制、常能出擊、　助前綫之進展、然全賽過程、港　聯　常佔勝勢、其不能反敗爲勝者、乃因射門欠準、是亦球運不濟也、</p>
<p>港華聯球員缺場數人、實力亦受影響、由老將葉北華等　補、葉氏世運歸來後、肩影球塲、昨日再披戎衣、重演身手、祇因球勢生疏有心無力、未有佳作、陳光裕首臨大戰、破綻甚多、每被吳占十衝過防綫、守衛上尙欠經騐、苟努力揣摩、則將来必或良　也、</p>
<p>昨日港華聯全隊鬆她散慢、實無聯絡可言、卒以一比〇見負、上半時五分鐘、星華快刀斷蔴、吳占士右路飛襲、銳不可當、堂吳氏抄入門角時、卽行掃射、張榮才反身一拍、球兒彈落　角、謝　福適門前、輕輕一撥、卽開紀錄、以一比〇先腴、十二分種、德輝盤球進襲、鄧約輪拗前一撞、皮球强出右方、爲鄧　森所得、乘盧而進、成輩刀之勢、最後一腳、軟弱無力、被張惠文救出、十四分鐘、蔡約翰得謝慶福之妙交、在門　施　、榮材及時一撲、祇負角球、廿分鐘、水益單騎愉襲、及　開弓、爲惠文拍出、落于廣森跟前、廣森大發慈悲、屠刀遲慢、失必　之良機、</p>
<p>易地再戰、仍然勢均力敵、石金落力異常、頻發群箭、皆因離鵠少許、無濟于事、最緊張之一段、則爲三分　時、港很　圍攻星華門、德輝、石金、北華、通瓊掃射、吿告中桂、無功而回、球迷莫不嘆一口氣、此後　攻此守、戰情平淡、　至完場、港華聯乃以〇比一見負、星華于三役中、兩負一勝、功德完滿、將于明日離港矣、</p>
<p>南華體育　特于昨晚八時在廣州酒　歡宴星洲中華隊、藉申東道之誼、是晚赴會者中西人士百餘人情形極爲熱烈、直至夜深始盡觀而散、茲將雙方名單錄下、</p>

<p>公開男子籃球賽、昨晚靑年會健身房、共有申組兩場、乙組一場舉行、首場甲組港大戰華南雙方實力懸殊、華南則守衛進取、均能一致、黃佐德、李傑聲、陳贊殷、陳贊頓、妙手投籃、鍾靈亦攻無不克、港大張少勉、秦章雋、許昆倫、遠取近攻、迭有隹作、雷夢迪、楊　華、均能沉書應戰、然華南鋒芒畢露、大有泰山壓卵之勢、港大竭力支持、亦無效果、因乃大敗</p>
<p>開賽接、黃佐德、鍾靈、陳贊股三路來攻、均吿得手、港·知来師汹汹、張少勉振臂而起許昆倫亦迭有收獲、但華南捲土重來、陳贊賦、陳贊殷左右開弓、鍾靈、黃佐德、二李俊聲三路抄擊、捷報　傳、港大揚旭華、雷夢聯左右迎戰、秦章雋、許昆倫肉搏多時、連復數域、許少勉亦策馬渡河、微有所得、惟華南卸尾擊來、港大全線、遂形崩潰、以卅九此五十六見敗、</p>
<p>次場南華抗廣大、雙方打來、未見出色、南華則　紮　打、廣大　衛防守頗佳、惟進攻力較形渙散、南華石振智屬攻得手、石振遠、贛傑民頗有建樹、廣大吳宜昨頗有佳作、鄭煜失機頻頻、盧勁頗爲中肯、戰事啟後、簫傑民先陷連　、石振智振　雙管齊下、吳昭奮起反攻、頗吿得手、鄭棠坤張榮才兩路截擊、不辱使命、梁江鴻反覆　搏、陳兆輝興師問鼎、無如南華軍容鼎盛、屬見石家兄弟探襄取物、巳而廣大啣尼窮追、積分接近、上半場、南華以十九比十八先佔優勝、易地交鋒、廣大連放三矢、均吿中鵠、成霸駕而上之、爲廿七比廿四、南華以楚歌四面、乃調石振志生力軍開到、聲威頗壯、遠近射籃、馬到成功、石振達、陳新球亦出師問難、廣大陳兆祥奮起追擊、桃投李報、然大勢巳去、嗚金牧軍時、南華以五十六比卅九吿捷、</p>

<h3 id="c73">球戲觀眾　應有三個補充定律 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>（一）準備律我們自己旣然是對子球戲有說看興趣的、當然　有比、專一的越好、如籃球或足球等、那麼在某場比賽未開始之前、自己應有相當補充的凖備、把目己的腦海都充實了（關于球戲的　識）才好去看、若自己根本對于這種　戲的規則也不滿、及各個位置應該怎樣打法……也　有粗淺的認識的括、怎說得上批評與研究呢，所以、我以爲　需要的凖備、必不在預測或批評……而在怎樣的去預先找　關于球戲所應有的知識、把這種知識灌輪到自己的腦袋賽、這此是眞正準備、</p>
<p>（二）練習律我們雖在各方而得到很多知識、但究竟這種知識對不對呢、　待我們貞地到球場練習才可以證明、更要練習得多、然後可以找出對不對的地方、故此我們要增加自己賽球戲的觀察力與批評力的話、必不單獨在多看球賽還需要自己多練習球戲、才可以根本的得到觀察與批評的能力、所以球戲的觀衆、第二　定律、就是、「自習律、要先自己對于某項球戲、有練習的能力或專試過時、才可以增加觀看的興趣及其他、</p>
<p>（三）如果律　這此定律或稱做滿足與煩惱律、即是若果一件事成功、（滿足）了就會繼續去做、對干效果也非常的增加、如失敗了就會發生煩惱、不願　去做、結果的成績也因之而滅少、由這看　、我們看球　的人、應有的第三定律、便是『滿足律』、若大家都能時抱着滿足的觀念去看球賽時、那末所得的效果當然比任何也來得大、因爲無論如何的球隊、　或劣的都可以使我們得到滿足的效果、爲什麽呢？凶　好的球隊、我們固可以得到技術等的正當的了解與　範、對于自己方面都可以獲得改正、而使到自心滿足、但劣的球隊、也同時可以使我們得到一個反面的認識、（怎樣就是劣）、我們旣在他方獲得　的正確觀念、間接的、都令到我們從好的正確的方向改進、使自己的技能達于　、這也是確足的地方、所以、我們觀賽球的第三個定律，就要拿研究的精神去換取『滿足』、故此當我們看賽球時、應有的觀念——論好或劣的球隊比賽、找們都應該有兩個看法、「怎機的好、好在那里」、「怎樣的劣、劣在那里」、自己由看賽球而得到滿足了、就可以加倍自己凖備與練習的興述、準備得充份、練習得多效、果也因之而大、效果良好、滿足亦多、因為滿足了、必定可以增　做的意志與實行精神、人人能够這樣、則對于香港胞僑的體育、很易振與起來、育的事業更爲樂觀、</p>

<h3 id="c79">詩的新生 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 陳現文</p>
<p>跟着二十月來抗戰局面的開展，社會現實的急遽　變　詩，這被認為最能直接傳遞生活經騐上的情緒的和對於社會活動（包括政治問題）能敏感地反映，而其觸動人們的情緒共嗚的作用比小說更有效力更迅速的這「文學部鬥」，也明顯地以另一姿熊出現了，而這姿態的出現，也是包含了無數進步的因紊的。</p>
<p>昨天，我們讀着怎麼樣的詩？——詩人們寫的是「杜鵑花紅了，一個少婦的心啊？」的詩或者是「雖然現是在太陽暄暖，但，西風啊，爲了　，荒草黃葉，各自哀憐！」的詩，以至於那些意境晦暗，造句織巧的排置着「駝鈴，黃沙」之類的字眼的詩，而較進步的詩，它歌唱「生活　泥河一樣兒流，」等等；但今天，這些詩我們只可從　人們的故紙雄中檢到，它們在報章刊物上的地位，巳給新興的詩所代替了，新興的詩人們，歌唱新的力，戰門的力，請着社會現實的轉化，它們在宇　行間加濃着火藥的氣味，加强着煽動的情緒，而這情緒也是以新姿態出現的。</p>
<p>和其他的藝術一樣，詩，也是跟着歷史　　的；昨天，針會的現實因素的反映，詩以　達个人的感情及一部分特定集團的感情為最高仟務，但，那種社會現賞轉眼就成過去了，新時代旣已到來，詩人們捉住了新的社會現實的需求，以自己明確的世界觀滲和純凈的感情去表現詩，如像過去英雄　人的詩否定天國神奇的詩，如像普洛列塔利亞特詩，否定布爾喬亞氾詩一樣，新興的詩人們同樣否定以前的詩的範式，以嶄新的陣勢出現來完成當前　特　社支的歷史的更高任務。</p>
<p>但是，詩否定過去的範式而展　听的途徑這並不是說明它推對了以前一切關於詩的解釋，譬如，素重感情的托爾斯太强調着詩是傳達感情的工具，它是　當為精神結合的手段的話，仍是適用於現在也適用十未來，每個詩的新形式沿着　个基準發展的，但，這又不是說我們要利用詩歌去傳鋒任何感情，如像過去那些個人氣氛極端濃厚或只能表露某一特定集團的感情窠臼，因為它們已為現階段的社會的現實因素期造成　更高感情所代替，而失却了對現階段歷史上的淮展的推動力，相反的，這足以為時代進展的障礙，所以，把它表示於詩是無意義的。</p>
<p>因此有人以爲詩人在現階段也同時要揚棄那最適台於表露个人感情的浪漫主義的作風，關於這樣解釋是有着不同的意見；高爾基在某種限度內，是去擁護浪漫主義的。我們知道，具有積極性的浪漫主義，能加强人們對於生活的意志，能與醒人們向頑固府現實的壓抑生反抗心，而並非條過去那些把人們從現實拉到虛幻的世界裏去，對現實不取批判的態度，而只沉醉於不可捉摸的意想，結果仍使人　於消極的思維，而無積極的行動那樣。</p>
<p>詩在現中國有新的前途，它是與其他的精神文化取同一步武踏着活生生的現實的，它要棄去時代的感情渣　而代以新的，並以明確的世界觀通過詩的形式而去推動社會現實向前進展。</p>
<h3 id="c80">「春」 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>有人愛黃　飄零，落花滿地的季節。秋陽夕照中躑躅於占徑間，座着自己孤獨的影子；或是庭院小坐，凝視黃柴，閒數洛花，而人們却說，「這未免太蒼老遲暮了，年靑的人不應如此撇集紅塵。」然而據說，詩人的慧眼却仍能從秋裏看出「生」。</p>
<p>還有人愛冷酷的嚴冬，一片白茫茫的雪，琉璃世界。據說這也是詩人的氣質，更是勇十的性格。我的思想遂馳騁於莽原，大野，冰天雪地中了。幹着偉大工作的鬥士們的心境又是如何呢？咒詛抑是欣賞？這答案且讓事實來塡補吧！</p>
<p>而我凡俗的庸人，却渴望着春大，活躍而富有生命力的季節呵！</p>
<p>耳邊響起了一陣話語；「春天來了！」不知是誰向我輕悄悄的可嚀。聲調是那麼温柔，和諧。推波助蘭，定將成為一曲動人的戀歌。但我却淡淡的說：一我們這兒沒有春天。」大約是憤慨于這漠然的態度　，並無囘話，來客的足音漸瀕的消失於遠力。</p>
<p>推開　，抬頭仰望，穹蒼是灰黯的，塞滿烏雲。這天吹來一陣風，難道是帶來春的信忽？我疑問着，迎面送來一口刺鼻的血腥，並　春的氣息。「我們這兒沒有春天」，我又默念着這句子。隨手關緊了窩戶。</p>
<p>駕一葉可想的　舟，蕩漾於記憶的海面；整個冬天，我背誦着雪萊的名句，「如果冬天到了，春天還會遠嗎？是呵，春天緊跟着就將來的。但如今，冬天去了，而我們這這兒仍沒有春天。</p>
<p>花生樹，羣　亂飛。一派和煦的氣象，媚人的景致，也　易使人嚮往，但江南的原野，不，整個的大地，再也不是寗靜，肅穆的了，惡魔带來了大騷　。平原上點綴着　凉；破垣斷　，血淋淋的屍身，被倫的少女，受難的童　。排方，這難道是春天的象徵？</p>
<p>告訴你；「我們這兒沒有春天！」</p>
<p>然而呵，我還要告訴你；「春天是會來的。」　過了汗的栽培。血的灌溉，大地便將囘春，原野上蕩漾着醉人的春風。</p>
<p>可是，未了，我印要問你了「你將如何的來為大地——我們的母親出汗，流血呢？」</p>
<p>『喂，你說，你說啊！』</p>

<p>— 杜又慧</p>
<p>這是一個秋天的晚上，在這中原地帶巳刮着凜冽的北風了。天空是　黑而多　的，我軍巳轉移到城郊的新防綫上駐紮了。在這晚上我軍是準備向　小城反攻的，因爲司令部得到一個情報，×人在這幾大來的苦戰死傷已很慘重，現在只剩下三百多人守在城裏等待後援。</p>
<p>到午夜一時，我軍的隊伍便出動了。我軍九連弟兄分散了，由各小路向這城包抄，在死寂的　野裏他們　黑螞蟻般的爬行着。</p>
<p>然一　障「禺隆！」「轟陸—的　炸聲。衝破了那夜空的岑寂，跟着便是一陣卜卜卜的機翻鎗聲，，和手檢聲。城裏是一片喊殺的疾走的哀呼的聲音。城裏的秩序顯然是很混亂了！</p>
<p>這時據我軍　達城郊。他們還以爲這是×人發現了我軍的進攻。可是過了一會那　聲是漸漸稀疏，以至於消失了。然而在那城墻突然樹上一枝靑天白日的國旗，在夜空中迷茫的鮮現的飄蕩着。</p>
<p>「我們的隊伍佔領了城呀！」連長說。</p>
<p>『那一支隊伍呢？…』弟兄們問，但是沒有囘答。大家正在猜疑這支神出鬼沒的隊伍究竟是誰？</p>
<p>『不是×人鬧的空城計吧！』一位弟兄是這樣說。</p>
<p>『天嗎得！』</p>
<p>『不—不會的，你們沒看見那城門已經開了嗎？還有人在門上唱『義勇軍進行曲呢』！速長很有把握的說着。哨兵囘來了，他把這消息證實了，於是我們就開進城裏了。</p>
<p>『不知是那一支隊伍先進威的呢』？這個間題還沒有得到答復，它旋轉在每個弟兄的腦子裏。</p>
<p>我軍進城了。在路上躺着一些皇軍的屍體和無數遺留下來的槍技，亂七八糟的掉在這裏那裏。</p>
<p>我軍的隊伍集合了。團長站在這隊伍前說話了：</p>
<p>『各位弟兄！你們以為今晚先攻進　裏的是那一支隊伍呢？』大家都沉默着。他繼續下去：『就是這帮從×人炮火中長進的小戰士！…』他把手指着傍邊那班隨軍出征的流亡少年。他們年紀大概由六七歲至十五六歲左右。『他們的年紀是這麼輕！可是他們對抗戰認識是比任何人都深刻，堅决！他們知道與其做一個亡省的奴隸！到不如　　他們的父兄到這戰綫上來　高明些，他們　意替父兄們　皮箱子彈，分担父兄的勞苦，並且可能內還能帮助打擊×人，今晚這英勇可嘉的行　便是他們一個很好的例子。……今晚他們十多位小戰士在我們隊伍未出城之　便已自動的偷進城裏，用手溜彈轟擊×人，×人在半夜裏　來以為是我軍攻進城勇了。他們在黑暗中互相開槍射擊，結果只殺了自己人，於是便在　　中國七八糟的，出城外逃走了……』說到這裏時弟兄們那笑了。</p>
<p>『我覺得很痛心！很愧慚！因為不能把這班有用的兒童獲得敎育的機會，使他們過着流亡的　塲上的生活。……同時，我們也覺得很欣幸！因為從這班小戰士的行爲便足以見得中華民族前途的光明，中國有着無千無萬這樣的小戰士，中國是不會亡的！中國前途的光榮的責任，就放在這羣未來的主人翁身上去完成它！…弟兄們！我們要向這羣　族小戰士致一個意的敬禮……』</p>
<p>我們全部隊伍都與奮得發狂了。我們在歡呼着「中華民族解放萬歲！」和「義勇軍進行曲」的歌聲中擁抱　這班小戰士。我們的抗×精神都給這英勇的機智的行為　舞起來了！</p>
<p>這夜。這城裏的人們是在一個民族的洪爐裏温暖地度過的。</p>
<p>註：本文所寫的都是事實，是一立在長沙歸來的隨軍服務團的團侵目見的事實。這羣　軍的流　兒童都是從　陷區，隨同父兄出來的，他們不願離開父兄，以便　同出發，直到近當局注意把這些兒童運到後方去集中訓練，這些就是　來的抗戰新軍了—他比的抗戰　力和意識，自然們今日的士兵是更英勇不　多少呢！</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Understanding of New Conflicts on the Soviet-Puppet Border <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Last night, Japanese and foreign news sources reported that a serious conflict occurred again on the morning of the 3rd on the border between the Soviet Union and the puppet state of Manchukuo. The two sides exchanged artillery fire for several hours. The Japanese side also claimed that the Soviet side had launched a large-scale offensive and that the two sides were still in a standoff, with the situation being extremely serious, and that "many soldiers defending the Manchukuo territory were injured." Just as the dispute over the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement had temporarily come to an end due to Japan's capitulation, such a major conflict occurred again on the Soviet-puppet border. Just as one wave subsides, another rises. Moreover, since Japan has already capitulated to the Soviet Union, why would it initiate disputes at this time? To the average person, it may seem very perplexing, but this is an inevitable new trend. It is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the fundamental causes and internal contradictions involved.</p>
<p>Although Japan endured military, political, and even economic losses in resolving the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, it was, in reality, a kind of capitulation to the Soviet Union. However, Japan's capitulation to the Soviet Union is not a sincere or permanent one. Therefore, the disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan cannot be completely eliminated by the temporary resolution of the Fisheries Agreement. The loss of 27 fishing zones and 300,000 yen in new rental fees that Japan endured in signing the new Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement is a secondary issue. However, its political loss is a serious problem. It cannot show the international community that it has capitulated to the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the Fisheries Agreement dispute, it stirred up another new dispute. This constant series of Soviet-Japanese disputes, on the one hand, can show Germany and Italy that it is still preparing to attack the Soviet Union, increasing their friendship with Japan and preventing them from providing aid to China, as was recently reported regarding Germany providing a portion of military supplies and economic assistance to China. On the other hand, it can deceive Britain and France, saying that it has not abandoned its role as the vanguard of capitalist countries in attacking socialist countries, preventing the increase in close relations between Britain and the Soviet Union and between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>From the course of this new Soviet-puppet conflict, it can be proven that Japan indeed has the above intentions. Although the Japanese side announced that the new conflict between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo occurred because 23 Soviet soldiers invaded Manchukuo territory and opened fire on the defending forces, shifting the responsibility for the war to the Soviet Union, the news reported by the Harbin foreign news agency was that the Japanese puppet troops first provoked the Soviet defending forces with artillery fire, and later, when Soviet reinforcements arrived, they began to return fire. At a time when Mussolini, following Hitler's annexation of the entire Czech Republic and part of Lithuania, and threatening small countries in Eastern Europe, launched a conspiracy to annex Albania to threaten Britain, and when British-Soviet relations were improving, with recent plans to send the Chief of the General Staff to the Soviet Union, and while attempting to form an anti-aggression alliance and intensifying the training of mechanized troops, and consulting with France on practical joint defense, the German and Italian aggressors naturally demand that their accomplices in the East ignite the Soviet-Japanese incident to contain Soviet active measures in Europe. The dissemination of the above news about Germany supplying China with military supplies and credit is proof of this fact. Japan cannot abandon its two accomplices, Germany and Italy, so it must make some gesture. Although Japanese elders, senior officials, and moderates strongly oppose the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Japanese military and fascist parties still want to maintain close relations between the three countries and increase more active cooperation.</p>
<p>In this Soviet-puppet border conflict, another more important fact can be seen, which is the intensification of internal contradictions within Japan. Although elders, senior officials, the financial world, and even some moderate military officers advocate détente with the Soviet Union, junior military officers believe that it is necessary to expand incidents in order to swindle military spending and suppress anti-war arguments and must constantly launch challenges against the Soviet Union. The early conclusion of the last Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement dispute was, according to reports, entirely due to the strong advocacy of elders, senior officials, and even some military officers and powerful figures in the financial world. Junior military officers were very dissatisfied, and some even advocated immediately waging war against the Soviet Union. Among the junior officers, the most hard-line and disobedient to government orders are the troops stationed abroad, especially the army. Therefore, before the government had even completed a week since signing the new Soviet-Japanese agreement, the Soviet-puppet border dispute arose again. At the same time, one can also see the secret struggle between the army and the navy. Recently, the navy's activities have been relatively active, and the army is sincerely afraid that military leadership will fall into other hands, or even be seized by the navy. Therefore, it has never been willing to relax its active and expansionist actions.</p>
<p>The new Soviet-Japanese dispute is just beginning. Yesterday's serious conflict has not yet stopped, and further developments deserve attention. However, this issue is not just a Soviet-puppet issue, nor is it just an issue between the Soviet Union and Japan. From the above analysis, it can be seen that it is indeed an international issue that transcends the Far East. Therefore, not only should China pay close attention, but Britain, the United States, France, and especially Eastern European countries, should give it deep consideration and make active preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Maintaining and Promoting the Fine Traditions of the New Fourth Army <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— General Xiang Ying Speaks, Recorded by He Wei</p>
<p>Note: I had the opportunity to meet General Xiang Ying, Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army, and he gave me a very systematic talk. I have recorded this valuable talk, but it has not been reviewed by General Xiang Ying himself. I am responsible for any improprieties or errors. The following is a record of his remarks: Reporter's note</p>
<p>The War of Resistance Against Japan is currently being fought. This war is related to the liberation of the people and determines the survival of the nation. The current aggressors are equipped with modern equipment. To defeat these brutal aggressors, we must mobilize all forces, unite all forces, and especially need an exceptionally outstanding army with the strongest fighting power to win the final victory in the protracted war and enable the Chinese nation to achieve true liberation.</p>
<p>Japan relies on the economic foundation of imperialism and has repeatedly gained military advantages in the war of aggression, attempting to use this advantage to destroy China. However, Japan is the weakest of the imperialist countries. Regardless of political or economic conditions, it cannot support a long war and cannot maintain its advantage over us in the long term. This is a fundamental factor that determines Japan's inevitable defeat in the protracted war.</p>
<p>At the same time, historically, no revolutionary army can obtain excellent equipment at the beginning, forming a disadvantage against the advantage, and gradually turn from disadvantage to advantage, and finally annihilate the enemy. This is mainly due to the revolutionary army's reliance on correct leadership and the broad masses of the people, the highest degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, strong will, and a spirit of loyalty and sacrifice to create the strongest fighting power. They can overcome all difficulties, gradually strengthen themselves, and achieve final victory. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan is a revolutionary war, and we are a revolutionary army, we can inherit and develop all the traditions of revolutionary armies, and we can not only carry out a protracted war, but also win the final victory in the protracted war. This is a fundamental reason why we can ultimately defeat Japan.</p>
<p>At present, the War of Resistance is transitioning to the second stage, which is when we prepare our forces for counterattack from the conditions of politics, military affairs, and economics. First of all, politics is more important than military affairs, the masses are more important than the army, and spirit is more important than material. The success of this preparation is the fundamental condition for determining the final victory. However, the ultimate purpose of preparation is to establish the strongest and most combat-capable excellent army to directly annihilate the aggressors and drive them out of China! Therefore, the fighting power of a strong army and the establishment and support of new armies have become the most central point in preparing for a counterattack and winning the final victory.</p>
<p>Our New Fourth Army was born and grew in the long-term national revolutionary struggle. It not only has a heroic history of fighting for national liberation in the past, but also created and inherited many fine traditions of the revolutionary army. We rely on these fine traditions to form the army's amazing fighting power to overcome any difficulties and become an invincible army. Now, in the War of Resistance to directly strive for national liberation, our New Fourth Army should contribute all its strength and unleash all its power to fight firmly to fulfill its due mission in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, our New Fourth Army is not only far inferior to Japan, but also to the general friendly troops in the War of Resistance. However, since participating in the War of Resistance in Jiangnan, we have been able to contribute to the War of Resistance and achieve initial victories, mainly relying on the revolutionary fine traditions created and inherited in the long-term struggle to form the special fighting power of our army. Coupled with long-term combat experience and flexible use of tactics, we can use the most inferior weapons to fight against the superior Japanese and achieve victory.</p>
<p>All the fine traditions of our army are factors that constitute our army's fighting power. The foundation of strong fighting power enables our army to use the most inferior weapons to fight against the superior enemy and gradually turn from inferiority to superiority. This is one of the basic conditions for the revolutionary army to ultimately defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>What are the fine traditions of our army? In summary, they are our army's various new systems, new spirit of creation, and new fighting styles. Some are inherited from the traditions of revolutionary armies in history, but most were established by us in the hard struggle, and after countless experiences, they were formulated as new systems, creating new combat styles and cultivating a new work ethic. We must maintain and promote these.</p>
<p>Now, let us specifically explain the content of the fine traditions:</p>
<p>1. Equality, Friendship, and Unity Between Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>All revolutionary armies, regardless of officers or soldiers, have the same political goals. They do not distinguish between noble and lowly based on official rank, nor do they differentiate based on the quality of life. However, due to differences in ability and responsibility, division of labor is implemented to carry out the unit's combat. Since everyone is a comrade, the troops can be united like one person, creating an invincible force.</p>
<p>Our New Fourth Army is not only a revolutionary army, but also one that was produced and grew up in the revolutionary struggle, and strengthened through long-term revolutionary warfare. Politically speaking, our New Fourth Army has consistently fought for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of society. It can also be said that it is the offspring of the Chinese revolutionary movement.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, our New Fourth Army inherited the spirit of the revolutionary army and carried forward this spirit: "Equality, Friendship, and Unity Between Officers and Soldiers" is the concretization and actualization of this spirit.</p>
<p>Why do we need "equality between officers and soldiers"? Because the revolutionary army is composed of revolutionary elements. Those who join the army are not for salary or official position, but to fight for the cause of national liberation and social liberation! Therefore, officers and soldiers should practice "equality." It should not be interpreted as "averaging." Only by practicing "equality between officers and soldiers" can we unite the entire army to fight to the end.</p>
<p>Why do we need "friendship and unity"? Those who have the same political will are called comrades. Comrades should love each other so that they can be close and help each other. Unity is strength, and the more solid the unity, the stronger the strength. War is a comparison of strength. To defeat the enemy, we must be stronger than the enemy. To be strong, we must be united. All the commanders, fighters, and staff members of our New Fourth Army should practice friendship and unity. Only in this way can the entire army be united, share weal and woe, and create a general fighting force.</p>
<p>How do we practice "equality, friendship, and unity between officers and soldiers"? (A) All members of the unit are revolutionary comrades. There is only a division of labor, no distinction between noble and lowly. No one is allowed to insult anyone, despise anyone, or oppress anyone. There are no strict boundaries between them. (B) Officers and soldiers have the same life and treatment, such as the same amount of food allowance and the same food. No private kitchens or special good food are allowed. The clothing is the same. Officers and soldiers share weal and woe. Everyone should have a good time together, and everyone should endure hardships together. Leaders should set an example and be a model for soldiers. (C) Officers and soldiers have no salary, only pocket money. Sometimes, due to financial difficulties, there is only food allowance, no pocket money. Officers and soldiers are the same. Officers and soldiers cannot have excessive special enjoyment alone. (D) Officers and soldiers, comrades and comrades, should respect each other, be sincere and kind in attitude, and speak frankly and kindly. Salutes are mutual respect. No superiors are allowed to deceive subordinates, and no subordinates are allowed to bully superiors, let alone insult or oppress them. (E) Officers and soldiers and comrades should respect, love, and be friendly to each other, support each other in illness, help each other in distress, help each other in difficulty, exchange experiences, and advise each other on mistakes. No one is allowed to despise or confront each other. (F) Superiors should care for subordinates, and put soldiers first and themselves second. Subordinates should respect and obey superiors. Veteran fighters should help new fighters.</p>
<p>2. Political Work System</p>
<p>War is a continuation of politics and the highest form of political struggle. War itself is political struggle.</p>
<p>The army is an armed group for political struggle and the most powerful and necessary tool for conducting and implementing political propositions. The entire army should have political leadership because political work is the work of ensuring the spirit of the revolutionary army, thoroughly executing political tasks, and completing political tasks. It is to ensure this army ideologically, in life, and in action, just like the blood of the human body. Without blood and blood nutrition, people will die. Therefore, political work is the lifeline of the revolutionary army. Without it, it cannot grow and strengthen, and it cannot survive.</p>
<p>3. Integrating with the Masses</p>
<p>The army is the armed force of the people, produced and grown from the struggle of the people and with the people. It is like a family with the people, sharing the same interests and concerns.</p>
<p>An army must not only unite and love the people, but also represent and protect the people. If a fish loses water, it will not only be defeated but also easily be destroyed. In other words, if the army has the protection of the people, it can survive and will surely win. If it loses the people, it will fail and be destroyed.</p>
<p>Our New Fourth Army has consistently fought for the interests of the people in the past and present, and always takes the interests of the people as its own. It helps and unites the people everywhere, so it gains the faith and support of the people everywhere, so it can effectively overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy with the help of the people at all times.</p>
<p>How to integrate with the masses?</p>
<p>1. Loving the people has become one of the three main disciplines of our army!</p>
<p>2. Nine of the ten points for attention are our army's disciplines for the people. Everyone must do it and every item must be executed: (1) Return doors and straw, (2) Sweep houses clean, (3) Speak politely, (4) Be fair in transactions, (5) Return borrowed items, (6) Compensate for damages, (7) Use the toilet, (8) Do not molest women, (9) Report when entering and exiting, (10) Treat prisoners of war well.</p>
<p>We must mix with the people.</p>
<p>4. Hard Struggle and Perseverance to the End</p>
<p>The Chinese army is fighting to achieve the goal of national freedom and independence. It will not stop fighting until the goal is achieved. Only through struggle, resolute struggle to the end, can we achieve the final goal. Even if we suffer setbacks, the next person must still persevere in the struggle. Compromise means wavering in the revolution, and surrendering to the enemy is a traitor to the revolution and a shameful sinner.</p>
<p>Our new army fears no difficulty. As long as we can defeat the enemy, we will endure any hardship. Enduring hardship is our tempered traditional spirit. Being able to endure hardship and work hard is our skill.</p>
<p>We have gone through countless difficulties and suffered countless hardships, and we are fighting for the cause of national and social liberation, unyielding until death. We would rather die heroically than prolong our lives in humiliation. This is our fighting spirit.</p>
<p>5. Self-Sacrifice and Heroic Struggle</p>
<p>Revolution requires sacrifice to fight, and war requires sacrifice to win. Sacrificing oneself can save the nation and liberate the people. Those who cannot sacrifice cannot be called soldiers. Heroic sacrifice is the true color of soldiers and the glorious cause of soldiers.</p>
<p>Our New Fourth Army has made the most heroic sacrifices for resisting the enemy and saving the country and liberating the people in the past, and is still sacrificing and fighting now!</p>
<p>6. Consciously Observing Discipline</p>
<p>An army without discipline will disintegrate and perish. Discipline is the element that guarantees the army's consistent actions, maintains the army's living rules, consolidates relations between the army and the people, and strengthens the army's fighting power. Whose army has good discipline, whose fighting power is strong, and who is sure to defeat the enemy. The quality of discipline is the standard of the quality of the army, so the army must have strict discipline, and everyone must strictly observe discipline.</p>
<p>The army's victory over the enemy mainly depends not on the superiority of weapons, but on the army's heroic sacrifice, bravery, good fighting, unity of the people, unity of top and bottom, and especially strict discipline.</p>
<p>"What is meant by consciously observing discipline?"</p>
<p>Most ordinary armies use coercive methods to require people to observe and maintain discipline. If the coercive force is not strong, discipline will also be relaxed. Because the people who observe discipline are not voluntary and automatic, but forced, so they often find situations where they pretend to obey and deceive superiors. This kind of discipline cannot be consolidated, let alone maintained for a long time.</p>
<p>So-called "consciously observing discipline" means that everyone understands the importance of discipline and automatically observes it. Do not be forced to observe discipline under coercive methods, or only observe discipline when there is supervision, but automatically observe it anytime and anywhere, so that observing discipline becomes a natural action, and violating discipline is regarded as one's own sin.</p>
<p>7. Absolutely Abolish Corporal Punishment and the System of Beating and Scolding</p>
<p>Corporal punishment is a cruel method used by feudal rulers to deal with the oppressed, and masters to deal with slaves. Slightly civilized societies and enlightened armies do not use this feudal criminal law to manage society and the army. Only the armies of feudal warlords, or armies that retain heavy feudal remnants, use corporal punishment (such as beating with military sticks and slapping) to manage soldiers. This kind of criminal law is equivalent to treating soldiers as slaves. Revolutionary armies absolutely do not allow the existence of this kind of criminal law.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, our New Fourth Army has thoroughly eliminated corporal punishment and absolutely prohibits beating and scolding people. Anyone who uses corporal punishment will not only be severely punished by discipline, but also be opposed and attacked by all commanders and fighters. Anyone who beats or scolds people will be punished and reprimanded. Regardless of whether it is a leader to a subordinate or soldier to a soldier, or the army to the people, if they violate this discipline, they will be sanctioned.</p>
<p>8. Study Politics to Arm Your Mind, Continuously Improve Military Technology, and Strengthen Combat Power</p>
<p>Military technology develops with the development of social and economic conditions and the rapid progress of war. The revolutionary army is the most progressive army, seeking progress in everything and surpassing others in everything. Revolutionary soldiers should constantly study military affairs and improve military technology to increase their combat power. At the same time, they should not only be able to use their own weapons, but also strive to learn how to use the enemy's weapons in order to seize the enemy's weapons and eliminate the enemy.</p>
<p>The basic principle of war is to preserve oneself and eliminate the enemy. How to prevent oneself from being eliminated by the enemy and not perishing together with the enemy depends on one's own skillful tactics and combat methods. Therefore, it is even more necessary for revolutionary soldiers to continuously study military affairs and improve military technology.</p>
<p>Every officer and soldier of our New Fourth Army should understand and study politics. Political life is the center of life. Understanding and solving problems from a political perspective is our characteristic.</p>
<p>Our army has never undergone any formal military training or education, but is fighting. Our commanders have never attended a complete military school, and most of them are promoted from soldiers or transformed from civilians into military personnel, but they are able to fight and achieve many amazing victories.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of all possible opportunities to learn is what enables us to constantly move forward and become the most progressive army.</p>
<p>9. Agile Movements, Cautious Actions, Fierce Attacks, Tense and Lively</p>
<p>Our combat style is: (1) Agile movements. Cultivate agile movements in daily life in order to achieve agile movements in combat. Learn agile movements, develop agile actions, and promote agile movements. (2) Cautious actions. Combat is not only a contest of strength, but also a contest of intelligence. Whoever can fight skillfully will be able to defeat the enemy and achieve victory. Whoever can flexibly utilize changes in the battlefield situation will gain a favorable position and can reduce losses and achieve greater victories. (3) Fierce attacks. Our New Fourth Army not only has a strong attacking spirit, but also attacks very fiercely. Only by attacking fiercely can we shock the enemy's spirit, shake the enemy's will, and achieve a bayonet solution to the enemy and achieve final victory. Our slogans are: Fierce attack! Fierce charge! Fierce advance! (4) Tense and lively. The life and work of our New Fourth Army are carried out in the most tense conditions. Tension is the spirit of combat. All loose and lazy phenomena hinder the progress of work, affect the conduct of combat, and hinder the pursuit of victory. Vivacity can develop people's autonomy and creativity. When this spirit develops into combat, it becomes mobility. But vivacity is not licentiousness, but a sign of vitality. It is not rigid or mechanical, let alone reckless, but an organized, orderly, and natural dynamic.</p>
<p>10. Seize the Enemy's Arms to Arm Ourselves</p>
<p>The weapons of our army are all seized from the battlefield because we have no existing ordnance factories to manufacture weapons, nor can we purchase them in large quantities. Only by seizing the enemy's weapons to arm ourselves is our traditional skill. Therefore, in order to seize weapons, we must learn to fight, learn to snatch the enemy's guns and cannons in battle to enrich our equipment, strengthen our firepower, in order to seize the enemy's new weapons on a larger scale and build ourselves into a modernized army.</p>
<p>Our weapons are all obtained at the cost of blood, so we must protect our weapons and treat weapons as if they were our own lives.</p>
<p>Our slogans are:</p>
<p>(1) Seize the enemy's arms to arm ourselves!</p>
<p>(2) Use combat to snatch the enemy's guns!</p>
<p>(3) Cherish weapons as if they were our own lives!</p>
<p>(4) Weapons and life coexist and die together!</p>
<p>I call on all commanders and fighters of the army to maintain these fine traditions, develop these fine traditions, and fight so that the New Fourth Army can become a new model army and resist the war to the end to complete the task of final victory.</p>
<p>All acts that violate these fine traditions should be attacked by the entire army. All corrupt phenomena and actions are not allowed to exist in our army, and all corrupt elements will be naturally eliminated!</p>
<p>I solemnly call on all the commanders and fighters of our army to fight to maintain and promote the inherent fine traditions of our army, and to strive to inherit and accept all revolutionary traditions and progressive spirits. Only in this way can our army become stronger and stronger, creating the strongest army in the War of Resistance, uniting the largest number of people, and working together with friendly troops to persist in the long-term War of Resistance in Jiangnan, preparing for resistance, and finally driving the Japanese invaders out of China.</p>
<p>Let our national flag, like a relay flag, be hoisted again from Wuhu, Nanjing, to Shanghai!</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Puppet Reserve Bank is on the Verge of Bankruptcy, Puppet Currency Cannot Circulate, Reserves are Extremely Empty <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Regarding the × puppet plot to undermine our national currency and disrupt our financial market by the puppet United Reserve Bank in Beiping issuing puppet currency and stopping the restriction on the circulation of legal tender. Chongqing financial experts yesterday (the 4th) expressed talks, pointing out that the puppet currency is bound to fail, and our legal tender has a way to circulate permanently. The meaning is insightful, the exposition is clear, and especially makes the general public's confidence in the legal tender solid and deeply understood. It is learned from the banking community that the contents of the puppet United Reserve Bank are as follows: The puppet United Reserve Bank, since its establishment on March 10th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, although its issuance of paper currency has reached an amount of 210 million yuan, only 90 million yuan is circulating in the market. Its reserves, in addition to 400,000 US dollars and 700,000 yuan in notes from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, have all been taken away by the × military. The contents of the bank are extremely empty. Although it has various restrictions on legal tender, it actually needs a premium of 80/1000. The Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate is also 30/1000. Its control of foreign exchange for exports has also failed to achieve its expected results, resulting in the prices of goods and stocks in various northern ports rising uniformly due to the fall of the puppet currency. The following is listed for review: (1) The amount of United Reserve Bank notes issued is 210 million yuan, with approximately 90 million yuan circulating. (2) Reserves for the notes include 400,000 US dollars and 700,000 yuan in notes from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (3) The premium for exchanging puppet currency for legal tender is 80/1000. (4) The Tianjin exchange rate has risen by 30/1000. (5) The control of foreign exchange for exports has failed to achieve the expected results. (6) Prices of goods and stocks are all trending upwards. (Central News Agency)</p>

The puppet army immediately returned fire, and the Russian army reinforced up to forty people, carrying light machine guns.

On the same day, a large number of Russian soldiers, carrying light and heavy machine guns and grenade launchers, fought with the puppet police. Before long, Russian cavalry, with small cannons and machine guns, joined the battle. Although details of these events are not yet known, it is believed that the puppet Manchukuo suffered considerable losses.</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Sino-Japanese Puppet Regime in Central China Establishes an Anti-British Association, Forcing People in the Occupied Areas to Boycott British Goods and Promote Anti-British Propaganda <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th Dispatch] According to reports from Nanjing, fifty-two anti-British organizations have been established in the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China. It is said that 150,000 people have joined the anti-British organizations in Nanjing. People in the area have begun to boycott British goods.

<h3 id="e15">Questions and Protests Arise in Parliament, Japanese Politics are Dark, Government Officials Transform Into Company Directors and Board Members <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Recent meetings of the Japanese Parliament have severely criticized the improper practice of government officials holding positions as directors or board members in most companies invested in by the government. For example, the Vice Minister of Communications has accepted the position of Deputy Manager of the newly organized Japan Electric Power Company. The fact that some government officials immediately take up important positions in large companies after resigning is an undesirable old custom in Japan that has aroused dissatisfaction. The "Chugai Business News" stated, "There is no doubt that government officials filling important positions in large companies often lead to undesirable results. When political parties began to oppose this move, the government replied that this is necessary for carrying out supervision. We cannot understand this attitude. The government can promulgate regulations to implement its protection and supervision responsibilities. It is not necessary for officials to serve as directors or board members of large companies."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th Dispatch] Moscow News: The Red Star Newspaper made a special comment on the current war situation in China, saying that although the Japanese army's occupation of the area near the Han River and Nanchang has local significance, it cannot affect the real military progress. The Japanese plan is to carry out economic exploitation in the occupied areas on the one hand, and to actively carry out military operations on the other, but both are extremely unstable. The newspaper continued, saying that the constantly developing guerrillas are extremely active, and a new batch of civilians joins every day, posing an extremely serious threat to the Japanese plan. The Japanese attempt to break the Chinese army's firm determination has failed, because the Chinese army has always maintained its high morale and combat quality. The newspaper pointed out that it is not uncommon for Japanese soldiers to be executed for resisting orders from their superiors, proving that the ranks of the invaders are extremely chaotic. The Japanese army has also suffered repeated defeats in its encounters with the guerrillas, which has further demoralized the Japanese army. At present, the entire occupied area requires more Japanese troops and financial resources to be consumed every day, and all the successes that the Japanese army has achieved have turned into nothing.</p>

<h3 id="e21">### Qi Pizhang Discusses Post-War Japan: Rural Areas Already Deeply Feeling the Lack of Young Men; Prison Cannot Suppress the Voices Against War <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Newsletter from the Revolutionary Society of China) "Japanese ××ism? It's coming soon! Collapse is not far off!" The setting sun outside reflected the afterglow of the setting sun, a young, New China Youth Army-style Mongolian youth, Mr. Qi Pizhang, said to the reporter.</p>
<p>In 1935, when Prince De was nominally still the Secretary-General of the Mongolian government and had not openly embraced the × people, he sent several Mongolian youths to study in Japan in order to train his henchmen. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China launched its sacred all-out war of resistance. These Mongolian youths keenly saw the economic difficulties within the country of the × people, the very high anti-war sentiment of the people, the heavy casualties of the × soldiers, and other phenomena. Their unwillingness to be slaves and their longing for the bright future of their motherland led them to leave the shackles of the × people under the pretext of leaving. They tried to return to the embrace of their motherland. Mr. Qi was one of them. He is a promising Mongolian youth who has the greatest confidence in the victory of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>"I returned to China in the late autumn of last year, when the war of resistance had been going on for fifteen months. The × people are becoming more and more bitter in the war, and they don't know where their mud feet will sink. The people's anti-war sentiment is growing with the war; workers are striking, and intellectuals are also cursing the war. It's coming soon, these will erupt sooner or later, and together with China's counter-offensive, it will be the time of the total collapse of Japanese ××ists." He emphasized this point.</p>
<p>"The total number of deaths of Japanese soldiers is more than five or six hundred thousand. The rural areas of Japan have already deeply felt the lack of young men. Last year, I was in a village near a village in Tokyo to escape the summer heat. During the Russo-Japanese War, that village only conscripted eight soldiers, but during the month I was escaping the summer heat, more than forty young men were conscripted. Just like that for a month, and I don't know how many more will be conscripted in the future. Compared with the people's sentiments during the Russo-Japanese War, it is very different, no, it is simply the opposite. I no longer see the enthusiastic emotions of fathers sending off their sons and wives sending off their husbands to the battlefield during the Russo-Japanese War. All there is is the silent tears of the departing family members.</p>
<p>"How about prices? Prices are soaring like crazy. A box of Japanese cigarettes used to cost only one copper coin, but now it costs more than twenty cents. Eating a meal is three or four times more expensive than before. The lively places like Ginza, the new wild chicken cars are almost extinct. There are also fewer buses running. In the past, university students and middle school students were not allowed to wear "geta" in the classroom. Now, they are encouraged to wear "geta". On the streets, you see students staggering drunk. Indecent wild chickens, decorated with international girls' "thousand-stitch belts" and donation. "Mud stick one (thief)" is increasing, how can people not rob people if they have nothing to eat?"</p>
<p>"What Japan lacks most are cotton, leather, hardware, coal, iron, and oil, especially oil and iron. Japan will soon run out of oil. Most of the factories in Osaka have closed. Only military factories are left, and even military factories will soon have no raw materials to supply. There are more unemployed workers than ever before. Strikes, strikes! Although Japan's strict police network has the ability to prevent people from openly opposing the war, he has no way to deal with strikes."</p>
<p>"Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan has become a prison for the people. Thousands and thousands of students, professors, scholars, and commentators have been arrested. Hitoshi Yamakawa and Yoneo Kuroda were also imprisoned. Only Takao Murofushi, who wrote "Respectful Announcement to the Chinese People" with Hu Shi, has not been arrested, and he often writes articles cursing the war, saying that Japan is an aggressor and that both China and Japan are "mutually harmed". Japanese elders and important officials, like the Japanese people, are all worried about when this war will end and the 'future' of Japan.</p>
<p>"Of course, there are proud Japanese people, too. The zaibatsu, the military cliques, young officers, officials, and civil servants, are flaunting their power and thinking of conquering China with all their might, regardless of the hatred and curses of the people of their own country, digging their own graves in China day by day."</p>
<p>"In diplomacy, Japan has only two friends who are in a state of mutual embarrassment, Italy and Germany. It propagates that: this fight is not with China, but with the United States and the Soviet Union, economically fighting Britain, and ideologically fighting the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>"Did you see Prince De when you came back to China?" The reporter, seeing that he had talked a lot about the situation in Japan, turned his tone and asked him.</p>
<p>"I saw him, because I escaped after returning to Suiyuan." He said frankly, Prince De is very depressed, and also very painful. The first time I saw him, he still looked happy, thinking that the students he had planted had returned. After each conversation, he showed the sadness of being a puppet. He himself wanted to use Japan, but unexpectedly Japan used him. The people under him are gone. His are gone, and became the old Han traitors of Rehe seven or eight years ago. His own actions are also being monitored by the Japanese. Prince De is a bit "regretful". I believe that Prince De will also return to the embrace of the motherland one day.</p>
<p>"Mr. Qi's actions" and "how is your work?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"I am preparing to go to Chongqing to pay my respects to the leader. Whatever work is assigned to me, I will do it. As long as it is work related to the war of resistance, I can do it," he said generously.</p>
<p>Leaving Mr. Qi, the twilight had enveloped the fields. Looking at the wisps of smoke from the chimneys, I couldn't help but happily think, you poor Han traitor puppet, the "talents" you cultivated are all standing on the front line to fight for the motherland, just like every Chinese national.</p>

He also stated that the British government has now assembled 16,000 reservists to engage in military strategy and training in new weapons in order to cope with the urgent needs of the crisis.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, April 4] The recent diplomatic activities here can be roughly divided into four points: (1) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has requested Britain to further its promise of aid to Poland into a bilateral treaty of mutual assistance in order to strengthen the anti-aggression front; (2) The British government has decided to immediately conduct negotiations with Romania to guarantee its integrity, as King Carol's instructions have arrived in London; (3) The Secretary of Commerce has officially announced that a British commercial delegation will go to Romania this month in order to drive out German political and commercial forces in Romania; (4) The Secretary of State for War declared that Britain has now formed a new mechanized combat unit in order to roam the European continent in wartime.</p>

According to another report, Britain has promoted Romania's defense needs. The official attitude is extremely optimistic.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, April 4] Officials here now advocate increasing economic pressure on Germany in order to cooperate with the democratic countries of Europe to force Germany back onto the path of peace.

<p>[London, April 5] According to foreign reports, the London branch of the United Press reported that the Polish Foreign Minister had requested Chamberlain to expand Britain's unilateral guarantee of Poland into a British-Polish military alliance.

<p>[Associated Press, London, April 5 (Urgent)] A Polish spokesman recently declared that the British-Polish military alliance has been scheduled to be signed today or tomorrow. It is reported to have been approved at a meeting this morning.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, April 5 (Urgent)] It is reported that Polish Foreign Minister Beck told Chamberlain that Poland has no intention of adopting a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 4] British-Polish negotiations were held all day today and are expected to reach an agreement tomorrow. According to official sources, the negotiations proceeded very satisfactorily. Colonel Beck, accompanied by the Polish Ambassador to Britain, spoke with officials from the Foreign Office and the Department of Law this morning. Later, the Foreign Secretary hosted a lunch for Beck, with the Duke and Duchess of Kent, Churchill, and Eden as guests. The Polish Foreign Minister then discussed with Chamberlain and Halifax in the House of Commons for two hours. Officials maintained a silence on the content of the negotiations. The official explanation was that "during the preparation period, the curtain of the stage is not raised."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, April 4] While Polish Foreign Minister Beck is conducting negotiations with the British government in London, Paris is also fulfilling its part of the responsibility by closely planning to unite the anti-aggression pact. According to news reported by "Le Progrès" this morning, Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador Surits, British Ambassador Phipps, and Turkish Minister Menemencioğlu yesterday for this purpose. The newspaper also stated that Bonnet told the ambassadors of the three countries that France not only attaches importance to the participation of Poland and Romania in the anti-aggression group, but is especially eager for the Soviet Union to join the alliance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, April 5] It is reported that France is currently considering giving the Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey in order to obtain Turkey's full assistance to the anti-Hitler group.

Italy is engaging in covert activities across its army, navy, and air force. The general headquarters of various forces have been moved from Rome to Trento, near the borders with France and Yugoslavia. Simultaneously, German heavy artillery is being transported into Italy. Reliable sources say that despite Italian government denials of any intended action against Albania, significant military forces are indeed concentrating in Berlin. Unverified reports claim that detachments of Italian air force personnel have already landed in Albania. The Albanian government has issued a statement denying any Italian military activity within its borders.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] Diplomatic circles here have received reports from Italy and the Albanian capital stating that Italy is preparing to take military action against Albania. Semi-official denials issued by certain quarters are likely unreliable. In a speech on the 26th of last month, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated that Italy considers the Mediterranean Sea a vital space for its survival, including the Adriatic Sea. He later declared on the 30th of last month that Italy does not wish to be confined to the Mediterranean. All of this carries significant weight. Italy has already dispatched numerous advisors to assist Albania and has made substantial investments there, effectively maintaining a monopoly. The intention now is to strengthen this position to prevent Albania from being swayed by other powers. Furthermore, the unresolved Croat issue in Yugoslavia and the potential for German intrigues, particularly the possibility of Germany establishing a foothold in the Adriatic Sea, are matters of great concern to Italy. Therefore, Italy intends to send troops to Albania to pressure Yugoslavia, preventing it from being controlled by Germany and stopping it from joining the security plan advocated by Britain and forming an alliance with Poland, Romania, and Turkey.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 5th] Last night, the Popolo d'Italia claimed that "reports circulating about the situation between Italy and Albania are entirely baseless and deliberately fabricated." However, according to an Italian communiqué, Italy, at the overt request of the King of Albania, is engaging in negotiations to strengthen Italo-Albanian defense. These negotiations are ongoing, and Italy has no intention of violating Albania's independence or territorial integrity. Rome believes that the joint defense with Albania is aimed at countering British activities in Greece and Yugoslavia and the anti-aggression front movement. Italy's occupation of Albania could make these countries feel the necessity of maintaining friendly relations with Rome and Berlin, allowing Italy to secure the Adriatic Sea. Italy's occupation of Albania would undoubtedly increase Yugoslavia's unease. Following Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, this matter is said to have stirred emotions in Yugoslavia, leading its people to support Britain's anti-aggression plan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] Reports from Albania indicate that Italian troops may land in Albania within the next day or two. The report stated that the Albanian authorities have rejected Mussolini's demand for peaceful occupation, although it is rumored that King Zog himself originally intended not to resist.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] The British government has indirectly warned Italy that any action that jeopardizes Albania's integrity would violate the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] It has been learned that the Albanian authorities have formally informed Britain that reports claiming King Zog of Albania requested to place Albania under Italian protection are untrue. The Albanian authorities have expressed disapproval of Italy's actions to expand its influence in Albania.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 5th] Reports received by political circles here state that King Zog of Albania, recognizing new problems arising from the European situation, has requested Italy to expand its military capabilities to respond to them. Mussolini's response is said to include repealing Article One of the Anglo-Italian Agreement to allow the dispatch of army, navy, and air force units to Albania.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 5th] Local commentators analyze Italy's activities in Albania, defining its meaning and purpose as: (1) A demonstration by the Axis powers as retribution for the encirclement of Germany; (2) Strengthening the authority of the 1927 Italo-Albanian Treaty; (3) Increasing German influence in the Adriatic Sea, aimed at Poland; (4) Warning Greece and Yugoslavia not to participate in unfriendly actions within the anti-German bloc; (5) Ousting Greek and Yugoslav economic influence and labor from Albania; (6) Securing the Adriatic Sea by establishing a naval base in Albania; (7) Enhancing the Italian military's reputation abroad; (8) Demonstrating to the world that the Adriatic Sea is within Italy's sphere of influence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] While rumors circulate that Italy is about to dispatch troops to Albania, responsible officials here are making no comment. The Albanian ambassador, recently appointed, has already flown back to his home country with embassy staff. Furthermore, what transpired during British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine's meeting with Foreign Minister Ciano on the morning of the 4th remains confidential to both British and Italian figures. It is believed that this is related to the talk of Italy dispatching troops to Albania.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Baghdad, 4th] British Consul Mr. Monck-Mason in Mosul was shot and killed today by a mob during a demonstration prompted by the sudden accidental death of Iraqi King Ghazi in a car accident. The British consulate was set on fire. Martial law was declared throughout the city, and order was only restored after several hours. Officials in London stated that the incident occurred because agitators incited mourners near the British consulate, alleging that the King's death was orchestrated by the British. Four suspects have been arrested and will be tried by a special court. The Iraqi Prime Minister visited the British diplomatic mission in Baghdad this afternoon to express his apologies, stating that he was shocked by the incident.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] Both houses of parliament are scheduled to hold a National Assembly in the Palace of Versailles on the 5th to elect the president.

<h3 id="e39">Hitler's Menace Turns to Denmark, Instigating Ethnic Issues, Planning Aggressive Military Alliance <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[London, 5th] According to well-informed sources, the current international situation is far from optimistic. Germany, considering Poland's resolute refusal to cede, has apparently abandoned plans to attack Danzig and is now focusing elsewhere. Nazi newspapers, with official authorization, are concentrating on the German minority issue in Denmark. The National Zeitung, linked to General Göring, voiced yesterday that Germans in Denmark are suffering from poor treatment, making daily life extremely difficult. Germans in Schleswig have faced hardship since separating from Germany in 1920, and their 'culture' is being forced to relinquish, a situation that is intolerable. Germany and Italy are still expressing anger over Chamberlain's second speech in the House of Commons. The Berliner Tageblatt correspondent noted that Nazi officials will not issue a response until Hitler returns to Berlin. Berlin views Chamberlain's and Halifax's actions as largely in line with Hitler's perception of the threats from Bucharest and Greece. Some believe that Hitler will transform the German-Italian-Japanese anti-Comintern pact into a military alliance. The leader of the Polish National Party declared in Warsaw yesterday, "If Germany advances an inch, war will break out. Poland will not only fight if directly threatened by Germany but will also resist any expansionist action by Germany in any sphere." This statement has caused considerable excitement in Poland. A Warsaw correspondent reports, "While Poland has not provided an official explanation, it undoubtedly refers to Danzig, Lithuania, Hungary, and Romania." After a prolonged period of silence, a semi-official Roman newspaper yesterday began attacking Britain, stating, "Britain's attempt to control Gibraltar and the Cyrenaica port, essentially making Italy a prisoner in the Mediterranean, is absolutely intolerable." Italian Minister of Education Bottai declared in Rome yesterday that the British anti-aggression front is targeting Germany, just as it is targeting Italy.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e40">Celebrating the Chinese Nation: Centenary Celebration for Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Today, all circles in Chongqing are enthusiastically celebrating "Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centenary Celebration". We respectfully offer our congratulations here to Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centenary for the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>"It is rare to reach seventy years in life", and Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo is actually over a hundred years old, but we believe that Old Mr. Ma still has particularly admirable and celebratory qualities, especially the following: First, Old Mr. Ma, as a veteran pioneer of Chinese Catholics, has dedicated his life to education. He first donated his property to support university education, such as Fudan University and other schools, his achievements in cultivating talents and developing culture are truly a model for the whole country. Second, Old Mr. Ma, as a centenarian, is always close to young people, cares for young people, and is always worried about falling behind. Therefore, he is always able to uphold justice in all matters, and he is especially keen to promote all progressive thoughts and revolutionary theories, and he does not hesitate to attack all stubbornness, conservatism, and counter-revolutionary words and actions. This is especially worthy of loyal emulation by national and social leaders today. Third, Old Mr. Ma has worked hard for national affairs and has been particularly concerned in recent years. Since the September 18th Incident, he has repeatedly issued appeals to stop the civil war and unite against foreign enemies. Afterwards, the unfolding of the national salvation movement and the formation and consolidation of the anti-Japanese national united front owe a great debt to Mr. Ma. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he has resolutely done his best, without giving up or slacking off; at this critical stage of the War of Resistance and national construction, we should especially learn from Mr. Ma's spirit, strengthen unity, and persist in the War of Resistance. Fourth, Old Mr. Ma has always been loyal to his country. Since the War of Resistance, he has upheld his unwavering spirit, traveling under the guns of the enemy as a centenarian, traversing the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan, unwilling to steal a living under the influence of the enemy. He continues to do his best for the country and the nation; and he also speaks to Chinese and foreign reporters from time to time, using his old and sincere patriotism and experience to explain the current situation at home and abroad, explaining that our country's persistence in united resistance against Japan will surely win the final victory. He cutsly rebukes the shameful behavior of the enemy, and calls on the righteous people of the world to swear not to stand with them. He expresses unlimited optimism about the future of the nation. Finally, in addition to repeatedly calling for unity, Mr. Ma also strongly advocates the implementation of democratic politics as a guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance. Therefore, today, when we celebrate Old Mr. Ma's centenary, we are also celebrating the centenary of the leader of our national liberation movement. This is Old Mr. Ma's glory, and it is also the glory of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Our celebration of Old Mr. Ma's centenary cannot be merely a formal celebration. We must celebrate these five great spirits of Old Mr. Ma, and work together to promote them and make them successful. At the same time, we must also take the practical action of "wishing Old Mr. Ma long life and wishing our nation long life", and all circles in Chongqing have stipulated that the congratulatory gifts should be used to rescue wounded soldiers and help those who have suffered. We should step up and promote this glorious donation campaign! We celebrate for Old Mr. Ma remotely here, and we celebrate for the leader of the national revolution and its future!</p>
<p>Where is Wang Jingwei Going?</p>
<p>After Mr. Wang Jingwei published an article catering to the intentions of the Japanese aggressors, using the nation to engage in ..., it seemed to cause some reaction: one was the righteous denunciation of patriotic people, and the other was the praise of the Japanese and the flattery of the puppet traitors in the north and south.</p>
<p>Newspapers in this city that cherish the motherland and uphold justice unanimously denounced Wang's article. Although these newspapers are still being shamelessly slandered by traitors and their newspapers, they are supported by all those who love the motherland, love the government, and all those who uphold justice. Even those who are currently working for the enemy, if they still have a bit of humanity, cannot help but feel deeply ashamed (although they have long lost their humanity, we still retain some hope that they will recover their humanity!). As for the newspapers that publish Wang's articles and make excuses for them, their usual words and messages pollute my ink and paper, so I will not add any rebuttal. For example, regarding the murder of Yan Zhongming, that newspaper first used the attention-grabbing word "Chongqing". May I ask if their true intention is to insinuate the central government? Is it maliciously and intentionally causing readers to misunderstand, thinking that the central government would really do such a boring thing - so as to fall into their trick? Otherwise, what does "Chongqing" refer to? And why is the word "Chongqing" dragged in from nowhere? On the one hand, they deliberately spread rumors, and on the other hand! Fortunately, the readers also know your meaning and tricks! You</p>
<p>We must still pay attention to the enemy's attitude towards Wang. According to a Shanghai telegram from Haitong News Agency one day, the northern and southern puppet regimes are planning to organize a puppet central government, intending to make Wang the premier. However, a Tokyo telegram on the 4th stated that the Japanese told Wang: "Although we completely agree with his views, we can never be satisfied with the so-called peace conditions he previously proposed, and in the current situation, Hanoi in French Indochina is by no means a suitable place for Wang himself and his peace movement." Then, it is already suggesting! History is a ruthless witness, watching where Wang Jingwei is going!</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, * Day] Overseas Trade Minister Hudson returned to the country by plane yesterday after visiting Warsaw, Moscow, the capital of Finland and the capital of Sweden. Hudson hastily ended his affairs in the capital and returned to the country because he wanted to discuss with Foreign Minister Burgin before he left England. Reporters interviewed Hudson at the airport, and according to him, when he went abroad, he met with the rulers of various countries. In short, various countries are extremely interested in Britain's military expansion. The industrial circles of Finland and Sweden will also send people to England to investigate during the day, so now is the time for Britain to develop trade with Northern Europe. According to what reporters have heard, the effects of Hudson's trip can be confirmed in 24 hours.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Hong Kong Air Defense Bureau Cultivates a Large Number of Air Defense Talents, Actively Trains the Public in Air Defense, Sends Letters to Major Commercial Firms to Send Personnel to Participate in Air Defense Training, Lo Man Kam Discusses the Purpose of Holding Chinese Voluntary Registration <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Hong Kong Air Defense Bureau has been extremely active in conducting air defense training for the public, and has organized air defense training classes in various districts to impart basic air defense knowledge to the public. A large number of people have graduated from the air defense knowledge class. Air Defense Commissioner Spurgean recently decided to hold an air defense class for commercial firm employees in late April. Yesterday, he sent letters to major commercial firms in Hong Kong, asking them to cooperate with the authorities and send one or two people to participate in the class so that after graduation, they can use what they have learned to teach their firms' employees, thereby promoting air defense propaganda. The Air Defense Bureau's letter to various commercial firms is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, this bureau has decided to hold an air defense class for commercial firm employees in late April, taught in Chinese and English, two lessons per week, and the teaching time is set to start at 5:00 pm. The courses are as follows: (A) Methods of guarding against attacks by shrapnel from bombs; (B) Methods of extinguishing incendiary bombs; (C) Gas defense; (D) Blackout regulations; (E) Design of air defense plans for shops. The purpose of the event is to cultivate air defense talents so that each commercial firm can have trained employees to be responsible for air defense design and air defense rescue team training. Please cooperate with us and send one or two employees to participate in the training, and please notify this bureau of the employees' names as soon as possible so that we can proceed, etc." In addition, the registration of British residents in Hong Kong started on April 10th, but only a hundred or so people have registered in the past few days. There are more than 6,000 British people in Hong Kong, but only this number has registered in the past few days, which shows that it is not enthusiastic. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is noted that the Chinese registration will be carried out during the day and will be handled by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. Regarding this matter, the reporter specially visited Chinese representative Lo Man Kam yesterday to ask him about it. According to him, the registration of British residents is handled by the special department of the police authorities, while the Chinese registration is handled by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. Although the responsible parties are different, the methods of carrying out the work are not consistent. For example, registrants must fill in their name, age, place and date of birth, address, telephone number, skills, and experience. Regarding the methods of carrying out the work, we have already submitted a complete plan to the government some time ago, but it is not known whether it will be adopted. When it is implemented, I believe that it will be nothing more than distributing formatted forms to various companies and firms for free filling in. The government's purpose in doing this is to hope to have a large number of talents serving in wartime. Enthusiastic people, regardless of whether they are British citizens or not, can register. As far as I know, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs has drafted a plan and it can be started today.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Yesterday's Second Trial of the Tea Fragrance Room Blood Case, Witness Could Not Recognize the Face of the Murderer, Yeung Siu-kei Detailed the Circumstances of Capturing the Murderer on That Day <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The case of Japanese man Yoshiro Aizome being slashed to death in the Tea Fragrance Room on Hennessy Road was brought before the Central Magistracy for a second hearing yesterday afternoon. First, a surveyor from the Public Works Department, Chung See, and a photographer from the police station testified in succession about taking pictures and making films of the scene of the incident. Then, Yeung Siu-kei, a customer who witnessed the incident, testified in detail about what he saw at the time and said that he did not know what the murderer looked like, he only speculated that he was a waiter because waiters often wear white clothes. At this point, the prosecutor asked Mr. Yeung, "Can you recognize whether the murderer is in court?" Yeung looked around and then replied, "He is not here." The prosecutor then ordered the defendant to stand up and pointed him out, but Yeung still said that he could not clearly recognize whether the defendant's face resembled the murderer.</p>
<p>When he was asked about the circumstances of the crime, he snatched the knife and said, "Don't slash, don't go, don't move." Then he heard the murderer say angrily, "You Chinese killed my family and raped my sister-in-law." At that time, I was still holding his hand tightly and the kitchen knife also fell to the ground. After finishing his testimony, he answered the questions asked by the defendant's lawyer, Li Ya. Following him was the testimony of Yu Kwok-leung, a female customer who was sitting with Yeung. However, a Westerner, Lu Shan, was sitting on Yu's right and a woman surnamed Chan was sitting on Yu's left. Before the incident, there was no movement or sound. When she heard the sound of someone being slashed, Yu initially thought it was someone chopping chicken. Then she saw someone being slashed in a booth. Yu said that she was so shocked that she could not describe it and did not dare to look again. Yu said "Oh no" and then Yeung Siu-kei went forward and hugged the murderer tightly. She immediately heard the murderer say, "You don't have to be afraid, I am getting revenge." He also said, "My uncle, younger brother, and sister-in-law have all been killed." Before the incident, there was no disturbance or special sound in the shop. When Chan Yuk-lan fainted, Yu called Yeung to save her. The judge then summoned Lu Shan-nu, a Westerner who was sitting with Yeung and Yu, to testify. Finally, Chan Yuk-lan testified. Because the judge said that other witnesses still needed to be summoned in this case, he ordered that the case be adjourned until this afternoon for another hearing.</p>

<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>An Ordinary Miracle</p>
<p>Young people lack experience; older people lack enthusiasm. The most precious are young students. They possess a high degree of vigilance and passionate emotions. From the May Fourth Movement to the current stage of the national liberation struggle, young students have poured out their hearts, sweat, and blood to contribute to their motherland and their work, always standing on the most progressive and important ground.</p>
<p>Students organizing and demonstrating collective strength is a common occurrence in the mainland. However, it is an amazing miracle in Hong Kong! Many miracles are blossoming from the salutes of national liberation. The organization and roar of Hong Kong students are but a rapid stream in the surging tides of the era.</p>
<p>Looking back, it was on September 24th of the year before last that Hong Kong's young students, unwilling to be separated from their motherland and in accordance with the needs of the War of Resistance, convened a meeting of representatives from various schools, initiated by Hong Kong University students. The Hong Kong Student Relief Society was established on the spot, and Sir William Hornell, former Vice-Chancellor of Hong Kong University, was appointed as Chairman, with Bishop Hall and Luo Wenjin as advisors. Since then, a student group representing nearly a thousand primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in Hong Kong, with a total of over 100,000 students, was declared established amidst the sounds of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Past Work</p>
<p>Although the aggressors were very crazy, the cannons of our War of Resistance gave them a painful blow to the head. Although the environment in Hong Kong is special, the work of the Student Relief Society has been carried out in the face of difficulties. Reviewing the work that the Student Relief Society has done in the past nineteen months, the major items include:</p>
<p>First—Regarding fundraising: (1) In October of the 26th year of the Republic of China, a frugality and thrift relief campaign was held, raising over 4,000 yuan. (2) The New Year's Charity Fair in the 27th year raised over 2,000 yuan. (3) In February of the 27th year, a three-day fast was held by students throughout Hong Kong to purchase Sero clothes, raising over 5,000 yuan. (4) The Wan Chai section's exchange fair in March of the 27th year raised over 100 yuan. (5) The concert in April of the 27th year raised over 2,000 yuan. (6) The Causeway Bay section raised over 280 yuan in April of the 27th year. (7) In the same year, the "July 7th" memorial flag donation raised over 2,000 yuan. (8) In the same year, the "August 13th" donation campaign raised over 2,000 yuan, plus many gold items. (9) In the same year, the "September 18th" collection of comfort items raised dozens of boxes of medicine, canned food, and food. (10) In the same year, the "October 10th" collection of cotton clothing raised over 7,000 pieces of clothing. (11) The New Year's Charity Fair in the 28th year raised over 3,000 yuan. (12) A campaign was launched during the Lunar New Year for children to donate red envelopes, raising over 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Second—Other national salvation undertakings include: (1) In the spring of the 27th year, five representatives were sent to Guangdong Province to contact various youth organizations and present a flag to Commander Yu Fa-mou, expressing the Hong Kong overseas Chinese's ardent love for their motherland. (2) In the summer of the 27th year, multiple propaganda teams were sent to various places in Guangdong, including Zhongshan, Xiaolan, Taishan, Jiangmen, Shunde, Chencun, Daliang, and Rongqi, to conduct various national salvation propaganda activities. (3) When the All-China Students' Federation convened its Second National Congress in Wuhan, four representatives were sent to attend, and they were elected as executive committee members of the congress with the most votes, thereby establishing work connections with students across the country. (4) Last July, Chairman Li Zheng-yao represented Hong Kong students at the World Youth Peace Conference, conducting international propaganda along the way and establishing regular contact with the World Student Federation and various overseas aid organizations. (5) Not long ago, in order to participate in battlefield refugee services, an organization was formed for young people to return to the mainland to provide practical relief work, with four groups serving successively. In addition, there are daily activities, and the general assembly and various sections also have organizations such as relief classes, literacy classes for civilians, song groups, discussion groups, drama groups, and children's groups.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The people in charge of the Student Relief Society often say to reporters: "Our capabilities are still very weak, and we hope that advanced teachers from various schools will extend a warm hand to help us!" Their sincere attitude is evident in their words. However, it is already rare and valuable that Hong Kong's student movement, which is like a desert, can have such results. In terms of the number of school units that are members, it has also increased from dozens or hundreds to nearly six hundred school units today.</p>
<p>Now that the term of the second executive committee of the association has expired, a general meeting of representatives from various schools was convened at the YMCA on the 2nd of this month to elect the third batch of officers and revise its constitution based on past experiences. The current organizational overview is:</p>
<p>Representatives from universities are organized by sending two representatives from each school unit, forming the highest authority. A supervisory committee of seven members forms the supervisory committee, and an executive committee of forty-three members forms the executive committee, all of which are produced by the general meeting of representatives. The standing committee is organized by the election of fifteen people from the executive committee, plus the chairman and vice-chairman of the general meeting, for a total of seventeen people. The standing committee is divided into five departments: fundraising, publicity, secretariat, organization, and life. Each department has one minister and two deputy ministers.</p>
<p>Under the executive committee, there are also two district committees, each organized by nine people elected from schools in each district, and divided into four departments: general affairs, organization, publicity, and service. Below the district committee is the section committee, and below that is the school committee. The school committee is the constituent unit of the Student Relief Society.</p>
<p>The committee that regularly implements the work of the Student Relief Society is undoubtedly the standing committee. The secretariat of the standing committee has three sections: documentation, administration, and finance. The organization department has: planning section, investigation section, women's student group, and children's group. The publicity department has: publishing, song, drama, and overseas publicity sections. The fundraising department has: fundraising, auditing, and material collection sections. The life department has: library, academic, travel, and sports sections. The membership fees that support the operation of the association are collected from each school once per semester, with one yuan for primary schools, two yuan for secondary schools, and five yuan for universities.</p>
<p>Future Arrangements</p>
<p>After the executive and supervisory committees were elected from the general meeting of representatives on the 2nd of this month, the first executive committee meeting of the third session was held at the association's headquarters at 7:00 p.m. last night. Those present included representatives from 42 schools, including Li Zheng-yao from the University of Hong Kong, Zhu Zhu-you from Lingnan University, Xia Jie-hua from Guangzhou University, Xie Han-jie from Nanyang Business School, Xie Yu-de from Huaxia College, and Yu Min-yue from King's College, as well as Mr. Lin Jia-xiao, Zheng Zhi-huan, and Shi Wei-heng. It was a gathering of student leaders from all schools in Hong Kong and a symbol of the united front of the student movement.</p>
<p>Chairman Li Zheng-yao, representative of the University of Hong Kong, presided over the meeting, and the chairman and all representatives gave detailed reports. Then, the persons in charge of each department of the standing committee were elected. As a result, the chairman will be from the University of Hong Kong, and the deputy chairman will be from Huaxia College. The secretary of the secretariat will be from Guangzhou University, and the deputy secretaries will be from King's College and Fanglin Middle School. The minister of the publicity department will be from Lingnan University, and the deputy ministers will be from Fenghua Branch School and Queen's College. The minister of the organization department will be from Jin Xian Middle School, and the deputy ministers will be from Overseas Chinese Middle School and Minsheng College. The minister of the fundraising department will be from Wah Yan College, Hong Kong, and the deputy ministers will be from St. Stephen's Girls' College and South China Middle School. The minister of the life department will be from the National University, and the deputy ministers will be from Xinxiu Girls' School and Guangda Girls' School. From now on, they will shoulder sacred tasks.</p>
<p>According to the association's constitution, there is an administrative advisory committee. After unanimous approval, the consultants who were hired were:</p>
<p>Huang Dunhan, Lu Dechao, Wu Hanzhen, Lin Haobin, Cen Lixian, Su Ruohui, Chen Tieyi, Li Peiwu, Pan Jingxiu, Zhou Guanqin, Hu Qiaoxin, Ye Ruochao, Zheng Xiaosu, and Zheng Zhihuan. The Overseas Chinese Education Association sent three teachers, and the Eastern District Education Association sent two teachers. We sincerely hope that the experience of the consultants and the enthusiasm of the young students will bloom into working flowers. Regarding the outline of future work, after heated discussions, it was decided to:</p>
<p>1.  Intensify relief work;</p>
<p>2.  Strengthen international publicity work;</p>
<p>3.  Strengthen self-education of students;</p>
<p>4.  Pay attention to students' lives and interests;</p>
<p>5.  Establish closer ties with teachers and various community groups;</p>
<p>6.  Develop work within schools;</p>
<p>7.  Mobilize all Hong Kong students to participate in the work of the Student Relief Society;</p>
<p>8.  Continue to launch service groups to return to the mainland to serve.</p>
<p>One more point that deserves our attention is the call for a girls' student group, just like the way the children's group was organized in the past. Let the advanced female students mobilize those middle and primary school female students who only "study and study" and are unwilling to participate in group activities and national salvation work. Needless to say, this is a great work that is meaningful and targeted at the needs of the environment. We sincerely hope that its plans will be realized.</p>
<p>At around 10:00 p.m. last night, when the reporter attended the meeting and rushed back to the newspaper office to write the稿, they were still as close as family members, enthusiastically discussing the development of the association's affairs. Hong Kong has these young people, Hong Kong's student movement is hopeful, and the Chinese nation has these children, the future is bright. At the end of this article, I would like to respectfully wish the young friends to join hands closely, develop together, and earnestly work hard to carry out the arranged work!</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Weather is Getting Colder: The Thermometer Dropped to 50 Degrees Yesterday; Hundreds of Homeless Refugees Huddle in Pity; Changeable and Unpredictable <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The weather in Hong Kong has suddenly turned cold in recent days, which is rare for April in previous years. Since the afternoon rain last week, the weather has turned cold, and the cold has become even more severe on the 3rd and 4th. At 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, the temperature in Hong Kong was 51.7 degrees, which was a drop of one degree compared to the coldest April in the past, namely 51.8 degrees recorded on April 4, 1905. However, the thermometer yesterday morning (5th) fell even further. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the temperature recorded was 50.4 degrees, which was more than one degree lower than the lowest temperature mentioned above, ten degrees lower than the lowest temperature in the same month last year, and seventeen degrees lower than the normal average temperature in April. If we compare the temperature recorded yesterday with the temperature recorded on the morning of last week, the difference is as much as thirty degrees. The change in the weather can be described as drastic. Therefore, the poor residents who have been sleeping on the streets for days are huddled in straw mats and tattered cotton, suffering from the cold and with many people sick. However, there are only three homeless shelters set up by the Homeless Relief Association in Hong Kong and Kowloon, with a total capacity of only over five hundred people. There are no fewer than thousands of homeless people in Hong Kong, so there are still hundreds of people who cannot get in. Therefore, the sudden drop in temperature in recent days has led to a sudden increase in the number of people seeking shelter. The three shelters are inevitably overcrowded. According to the people in charge of each shelter, each shelter has a fixed number of homeless people, but the weather has suddenly turned cold and the number of people seeking shelter has been increasing every day. As a charitable organization, it is not appropriate to refuse requests, even from people who are far away. Therefore, the number of people housed in each shelter has exceeded the fixed number by about ten people each day, and the equipment inside, such as cotton batting and burlap bags, is not enough for distribution. It is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will have pity on these poor people shivering in the cold wind and provide assistance, either by donating clothing or donating large sums of money, so that more shelters can be set up to spread kindness and allow the general homeless population to have shelter.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e52">In the Refugee Camp: <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Jing</p>
<p>As usual, Hong Kong's Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke, reports the number of refugees in the government's refugee camps in Hong Kong once a week. But apart from the increase or decrease in the number of people, nothing else can be seen. This report can be said to be almost like the daily tide report in the news column, such as when it rises and when it recedes, as if there is no other connection!</p>
<p>However, the refugee camp is advancing on the road to construction day by day. The people living inside, who initially came with a worried mind, are slowly dissipating their worries today. During the day, they work, study, play ball, and live a very orderly life.</p>
<p>These refugee camps are managed by the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, which has three subcommittees responsible for all matters: the Industrial Committee, the Education Committee, and the Food Committee. I plan to report on the general situation in the camp based on these three items, following Dr. Selwyn Clarke's weekly reports.</p>
<p>Let's talk about industry first. These are handicrafts, and there are many kinds. There are tailoring, broom making, woodworking, mat weaving, and textiles. Recently, the Industrial Committee budgeted two or three thousand yuan to build a workshop in King's Park. Last month, Ms. Liang was sent by the committee to see a towel factory, and later reported the budget for purchasing four machines from the towel factory. The committee decided to build the factory first before starting to deal with it. Taking King's Park camp as an example, although there is currently one clothing army, in order to celebrate the April 4th Children's Day, they specially sewed 150 children's shirts in two weeks, so that the children could happily spend their Children's Day. Ma Tau Chung camp is also like King's Park, now speeding up the construction of bamboo broom Gui brooms, while North Point camp is weaving rattanware.</p>
<p>In terms of education, Ma Tau Chung camp has 230 children, of whom 165 are receiving primary education like children in ordinary schools. There are plans to enable them all to receive education, and it has been decided to hire another teacher with only one teacher at present. However, King's Park camp has 200 refugee children waiting to be educated, because of the lack of teachers, but the shorthand class has recently started.</p>
<p>What did the Education Committee prepare for the refugees on Children's Day? Yes. A grand celebration was held in each of the three camps in King's Park, Ma Tau Chung, and North Point, with music and dramas complete.</p>
<p>As for the refugees' food, there doesn't seem to be much to report here. They have two meals a day, but it's hard to say how nutritious they are.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Xinhui Regained; The Four Weeks Around Jiangmen are All Under Our Control; Chaotic Situation of Repeated Hand-to-Hand Combat on Various Fronts; The Enemy's Emergency Forces are Rapidly Advancing on Shaping <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Macau Special Dispatch] After our army retreated from Jiangmen for the third time, the enemy's reinforcements continued to increase. As of the 4th, it was reported that our army had withdrawn from Huicheng and was continuing to resist on the outskirts of the city. According to continuing reports, after our army withdrew from the Jiangmen urban area yesterday, the enemy immediately advanced its vanguard into Jiangmen and engaged in fierce fighting with the forces defending Huicheng on Guifeng Mountain. The enemy used aircraft to assist in the battle, constantly bombing and destroying the temporary construction fortifications, which were completely destroyed. When the enemy crossed the defensive line and advanced towards Huicheng, our army, having lost the outer defense line, immediately moved its position and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat on the outskirts of the city. Until 12:30 p.m. yesterday (5th), our main force arrived and defeated the enemy troops near Huicheng, and our army recaptured Huicheng.</p>
<p>Our Army Controls All Fronts</p>
<p>Macau Quick News: For days, our army and the enemy have been fighting hand-to-hand near Jiangmen, charging back and forth, gaining and losing ground no less than ten times. In the end, since Jiangmen was indefensible, both our army and the enemy abandoned Jiangmen. Three days after our army withdrew, the enemy still did not dare to enter and garrison the city. At present, our army is deploying new positions in the vicinity to continue the resistance. Jiangmen is still under the control of our artillery. However, a unit of the enemy has crossed Jiangmen and is advancing towards Huicheng along the Ningyang Railway. All foreigners inside and outside Jiangmen have left the country. Most of the churches have been burned down by the enemy. It is feared that the refugees sheltering in the churches and the Chinese missionaries have been killed.</p>
<p>The Battle Situation on Various Fronts is Unclear</p>
<p>Since receiving the report on the battle between Tangbu Wai and Huicheng on the 3rd, no accurate news has been received in the past 24 hours. It is believed that the battle situation there is in chaos. According to foreign news from Guangzhou, a team of enemy artillery departed from Guangzhou on the 2nd to join the battle in the Jiangmen area, leaving Guangzhou's defenses extremely vulnerable.</p>
<p>The Enemy Urgently Invades Shaping</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Xijiang: The enemy troops at Shaping once invaded some days ago but have already retreated after our army offered fierce resistance. However, since yesterday (1st), the enemy suddenly sent a large number of cavalry from the Heqing area to advance towards Shaping. Our troops stationed in Shaping immediately defended the area based on its dangerous terrain. The enemy hesitated and retreated, and there were no battles or killings until evening. However, it is reported that there has been an increase in enemy forces in the Heqing and Jiujiang areas, and it is speculated that they intend to launch a large-scale invasion of Shaping. At present, our regular army is being deployed from a certain direction to provide reinforcements, and a major battle will break out within days.</p>
<h3 id="e54">× Fearing the Pressure of Our Mighty Army, the Northern Route × Lies Dormant; We Actively Deploy New-Type Positions; the Southern Section of the Guangdong Route × Troops Are Frequently Busy <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from the North River) According to military intelligence here, recently the × army has temporarily changed its attempt to spy on Shao (Guan) and open the Guangdong Route. Instead, it is transferring troops to attack Xinhe, first seeking to consolidate the periphery of Guangzhou and eliminate our guerrilla forces. It is also stabilizing a certain military headquarters. Therefore, the battles on the northwest, Ting, and Qiongya routes of Guangdong Province in the past ten days have been very quiet, except for our army's counter-offensive. However, this action of the × army precisely demonstrates the prelude to its desire to expand its invasion in South China. The Guangdong military authorities have been more actively deploying in the past ten days in order to seize the initiative. The following is a record of the military situation on the northern route in recent days:</p>
<p>The × of Hua County Shortens the Defense Line</p>
<p>Since our main force and the central mechanized troops returned from northern Jiangxi and continued south to the front line and deployed new positions, the counter-offensive military affairs on the northern route have entered a new stage. The × entrenched in Conghua, northern Guangdong, is very panicked. In recent days, the new Jiangcun, Heng, Xiangshan, and Shengang Taipingchang areas in the southern section of the Guangdong Route have stepped up the deployment of trenches, barbed wire, and foxholes, with strict defenses, as if on the eve of a major battle. Fearing surprise attacks by our army and guerrillas, they have shortened the defense line, abandoning unnecessary strongholds and concentrating on defending important strongholds. In Hua County, except for Xiangshan, Shijiao, Hengtan, Longxiang, Pingshan, Street, Longkou, Xiaobu, and other places where there are still three or four hundred × soldiers stationed, the × soldiers dare not stay in the surrounding villages, and there are no × traces. In Conghua, the × soldiers in Shengang and Taipingchang on the front line have repeatedly invaded our positions in recent days, but after our new mechanized army arrived at the front line, they no longer dare to act rashly. The floating bridge built some time ago in preparation for an attack on our Aotou has now been dismantled for fear of our army's counter-offensive. All the bridges in the villages near Baishuitak, Shajian Village, and Taipingchang downstream of Shengang have been demolished, reportedly to prevent our army from Yue River from pursuing the enemy at places such as Zuilou. It was also found that more than a dozen aircraft were originally stationed near Dapu and the airport near Taipingchang. Recently, due to the active activities of our new air force, which frequently dispatched bombers to bomb × positions, fearing being bombed by us, some of them have flown to Guangzhou. There are now only three or four × aircraft left, all camouflaged. Also, it was found that on the Guangdong Route</p>
<p>X Intensifies the Construction of the Jiangge Bridge</p>
<p>Also, it was found that the × on the front of the southern section of the Guangdong Route has been extremely busy transporting recently. The × military vehicles from Guangzhou to Tingcun last week came and went in an endless stream all day long. Since the × army occupied Guangdong, it has been engaged in organizing the transportation from Guangzhou to various outer defense strongholds. In addition to the public route, the Guangdong-Han, Guangzhou-San, and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways are also used as much as possible. However, the railway bridge near Jiangcun on the Guangdong-Han line has not yet been repaired by × because it was bombed by us. Therefore, in recent days, the Guangdong Route × military vehicles can only reach Jiangcun, and the connection between Xinjie in Hua County and Guangzhou has not been restored. Now × regards Xinjie as an important place to invade northward along the Guangdong Route and shield our army's counter-offensive, and is eager to restore traffic from Guangzhou to Xinjie. Therefore, in recent days, technicians and engineers have been sent from Guangzhou to repair the Jiang Railway Bridge and nearby roadbed sleepers. It is heard that it will soon be passable by the military. This further shows the aggressive ambitions of the people.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone and Chairman of Guangdong Province Li Hanhun believe that with the launch of the second phase of the war of resistance, politics is more important than military affairs, and mobilizing the people to participate in the war of resistance has become an urgent task at present. In order to cultivate a large number of cadres and carry out in-depth propaganda work in rural areas, they are planning to set up a training institute for party, government, and military cadres in a certain place in northern Guangdong. In order to understand the actual situation of each step and promote wartime administration, they convened a meeting of administrative commissioners and county magistrates of various districts in northern Guangdong last month to inquire and instruct everything, and re-formulated administrative guidelines, requiring all counties and cities to strictly follow and implement them. It is heard that its contents include the following principles: (1) Select anti-Japanese base areas in various counties, and public officials must not retreat across the border under any circumstances to maintain the implementation of government orders in various counties in the war zone. (2) All wartime work in various counties must adapt to military needs, such as organizing military transportation agencies, etc., to facilitate military progress. (3) Vigorously ban opium and gambling, eliminate corruption and clarify history and governance. (4) Unify the mobilization of the people in various counties, and strive for political coordination with the military and administrative harmony with the people to benefit the war of resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e56">The × Army on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road Reinforces the Xinhe Line <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanhai] After the bloody battle of Xinhe began, the × soldiers drew troops from the Jiujiang troops to reinforce the Xinhe lines. Unexpectedly, the × was annihilated in large numbers by us in recent days. The × chieftain Ando was quite anxious about this and actively requested assistance from various parties. It was found that yesterday (the 2nd), the troops stationed in the towns of Yanbu, Shaobian, Hubang, Beicun, Qicha, Xiushui, Dajianli, etc., within the Nanhai prefecture on the Guangzhou-Sanshui line were concentrated and transferred to the Jiang-Fo road along the Guangzhou-Yunnan highway to Jiujiang to provide assistance to Jiangmen.</p>
<h3 id="e57">× Reinforcements Flood into Xinhe; Our Army in Sanshui Launches a Timely Counter-Offensive; No More × Traces in the Old Sanshui Area; The Rumor of × Attacking Lubao Is Self-Defeating <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xijiang] After the Xinhe battle began, the Guangdong ×, due to insufficient troop sources, successively reinforced Xinhe with × soldiers from various lines. Therefore, the × entrenched in Southwest, Hekou, and Sanshui have moved south one after another in recent days, scurrying toward Jiujiang and Daliang. Only a small number of × soldiers are left on the Guangzhou-Sanshui line for guard duty, and the defenses are empty. Our counter-offensive army defending the north bank of the Xijiang River, considering that a large number of × soldiers have been transferred south for reinforcement, should seize the opportunity to launch a counter-offensive and quickly send out squads to attack and harass ×. Therefore, the × troops at the outposts of Huailangang, Mian, Hekou, Xinxu, Makou, Ganggen, etc. on the Sanshui front line have been lying dormant in one corner for the past few days, building strongholds and stubbornly defending themselves. Since the towns of Jiaoni, Laoyazhou, and Yisan in Sanshui across the river were recaptured by our army in Qingqi Zaotang yesterday, the × in Tieshanninlu no longer dare to cross the river to invade again. Therefore, there are no more × traces in the old Sanshui area. Fearing that our army would cross the river to attack, the × in Makou Langang and other places shelled our positions in Mafang, Qingqi, and Heli on the 29th and 30th, and sent rubber boats to patrol and spy around the estuary, pretending to attack. However, according to telephone calls from the front, the × at each stronghold have not moved rashly. Also, last week, transportation was frequent in the Yang, Lu, and Lubao West Road areas, and it was rumored that they would invade Lubao, an important stronghold on our Xiaobei River, within ten days in order to attack Guilin to the west. However, according to the latest intelligence, after the × army was transferred to support Xinhe, the × soldiers in that area have been successively transferred to other locations. The rumor that the × army would attack Lubao has been self-defeating.</p>
<h3 id="e58">× Aircraft Fly in Batches to Invade Northern Guangdong <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 4th] At noon on the 3rd, three × aircraft bombed the Wengyuan, Conghua, and Xinfeng highways in three batches, successively dropping bombs in Yuexiang under Qingyuan, outside the West Gate of Xinfeng, Wan'an Gang under Fogang, and Yiniubeiji in Conghua, destroying several civilian houses and killing one person.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Four Counties Are Plagued by a Grain Shortage <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xinhui] The four counties are not rice-producing areas. Daily food supplies depend on the Xijiang River. Since the Jiangmen battle, Shapin has been a place where the × and our armies fought fiercely, and the Xijiang waterway has been blocked as a result. Rice and grain cannot be supplied, and grain prices have risen day by day. After Jiangmen fell, the transportation hub fell into the hands of the ×, and grain prices in the four counties soared even more. Because there is not much grain left, a restriction method was proposed this month, limiting each person to buy one dime per day. As a result, a grain panic occurred throughout the four counties. The authorities are now seeking relief from the provincial government to solve the difficult situation. Also, since the × army invaded Jiangmen, iron riders have been dispatched in all directions. The general public is paying close attention to the situation in Hetang and Chaolian, both of which belong to Jiangmen. According to a friend who escaped from Hetang on the 2nd, the two armies fought fiercely after the start of the battle in Dingmen. The sound of shelling in Hetang was very clear. However, Hetang is surrounded by water on all sides and is located in a remote corner. It is not a military stronghold. The × army is focusing all its attention on the Jiangmen Shapin Huicheng line, so no × riders have arrived in Hetang yet. Only × aircraft occasionally come to scout. As for Chaolian, it has been found that the × army has arrived. The × soldiers who entered Chaolian mostly looted food. All rice, grain, and livestock were taken away in large quantities, so the food problem in Hetang is even more serious.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Another Group of Overseas Chinese from Siam Returns to China to Participate in the War of Resistance <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shantou] Since the start of the July 7th War of Resistance, no less than a thousand overseas Chinese from Siam have returned to China to serve. On the 30th of last month, the Siamese ship Meihua arrived in Shantou. There were also eleven young men from Siam, including Fu Mengba, Moke Shun, Xu Wenshan, Liao Chengzhang, Han Jie, Chen Weikang, Wang Luzhi, Han Ruiguang, Fu Hefu, Wu Kunyuan, and Xing Yili, who returned to China at their own expense to serve, and brought more than 40 books of medicines. They were received by the Anti-Japanese Comrades Association of Overseas Chinese from Siam in the city, and a tea party was held to welcome them, reporting on the recent situation in the motherland and the points that the Overseas Chinese National Service Corps attaches importance to. As for the medicines they brought, the association has also negotiated for duty-free entry. It was found that Mr. Fu and others are all professional drivers. They have now decided to take the medicines and serve under Commander Xue of a certain war zone. A telegram has been sent to report, and the Siamese Anti-Japanese Association is responsible for entertaining them before it is sent.</p>
<h3 id="e61">From Huiyang to Chaoan (Continued) <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Guangjin</p>
<p>3. Arriving in Chaoan</p>
<p>The day of rest has passed, and we continued to advance towards our destination. After passing through Fengshun and crossing Jieyang, we arrived in Chaoan after another four days of travel.</p>
<p>Chaoan, which had been ravaged and raped by the × people, was still very innocent and lively. The solemn houses still stood intact before people's eyes. The noise of people on the streets, the sound of buying and selling in shops and companies, the sound of machines in factories, and the sound of cars speeding on the roads jointly called out the prosperity and liveliness of the city. This made the people who ran out of the occupied areas see how free and happy, how lovely and prosperous, the children and land in the embrace of the motherland are, and how much it increased their hatred of the × people and their ambition to fight back to their old homes.</p>
<p>However, when the motherland encountered unprecedented difficulties, and in the midst of the mad tide of invasion raging, Chaoan had been threatened by the × people's artillery fire and smelled the strong smell of gunpowder. At the same time, like other places, it was often raided by fierce × aircraft and could no longer live a peaceful life.</p>
<p>The houses in front of the railway station have been deeply imprinted with many scars. This is a permanent souvenir given to the people of Chaoan by the × aircraft. However, the madness of the invaders can only awaken the sweet dreams of the children of Chaoan and cannot destroy their hearts of resistance. Just look at groups of young men and women who have enthusiastically raised their hands in resistance and shouted out that they do not want to be slaves.</p>
<p>Their blood is boiling. This boiling blood has not only written glorious historical facts, but will also mark the great charm of the times.</p>
<p>In the past, the young people here had organized many teams and followed the army to the front line to bravely struggle for the nation, giving spiritual encouragement to the people in the rear. Now, the call of "We want to follow the army to kill ×" has become noisy again. In fact, many enthusiastic male and female comrades have run to the camps of the national army to fight alongside the brave anti-Japanese soldiers for the freedom of the motherland. They are not for promotion or wealth, but for resisting fascist aggression and fighting for the freedom and liberation of the people.</p>
<p>The young people here are enthusiastic and brave. This can be seen from their work, which should be promoted and praised. However, their past work has not penetrated into the masses, and secondly, they have not been able to use it accurately. They have not really and widely mobilized a large number of young people to participate in the work, nor have they mobilized the people of the whole county to participate in the war of resistance in practice. At the same time, they have not particularly demanded the accuracy of the work, which often caused many unnecessary frictions internally and externally, and encountered many tragic lessons. This is an irreparable loss!</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the work of mobilizing the people in Chaoan has not been widely carried out. On the one hand, the work done by the general youth comrades in Chaoan is not enough and not popular enough. On the other hand, the local party and government have not provided active political leadership, which is also a decisive reason.</p>
<p>The weaknesses pointed out above are completely objective facts that should be overcome urgently. Do not let it continue or expand, otherwise it is very likely to develop into a serious crisis. The previous fall of Huiyang, although there were other reasons, the existence of this weakness was also a significant link, so that the people of the whole county did not widely mobilize to exert their great power to resist aggression and defend their homeland. As a result, they were at a loss when the × people landed. Not only did they fail to give the × people a severe blow, but they also failed to inflict a considerable price on the × people, and a series of tragedies were staged—I don’t know how many compatriots were killed! Oh! This bloody lesson before our eyes is something we can never forget. The children of Chaoan today, bearing this blood-red lesson, should be vigilant, ah.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Hollywood Companies Strive to Shoot War Films <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In the environment full of gunpowder in the Spanish war, the Sino-Japanese war, and the entire world, Hollywood film companies are currently competing to shoot war blockbusters.</p>
<p>In the film city, most of the studios have recently had the sound of swords and guns, presenting a tense situation of war. The actress put peppermint oil on her eyes, so that when the male lead goes to war, tears will naturally fall in the smile. Every war movie is like this.</p>
<p>Now, Hollywood is producing all the films that can be shot. After Paramount's Invasion is completed, we may even find a film that exposes plunder.</p>
<p>When Griffith shot The Birth of a Nation, he spent a lot of money on war shots, but the cost of shooting war films now is more than the cost at that time. Temporary soldiers are paid $10.50 a day for filming, and renting firearms costs $50 per thousand.</p>
<p>In Selznick's studio, the war shots of Gone With The Wind have already started filming. The scene of burning Atlanta is very grand, and these war shots are all filmed using directorial techniques. Some of them are very magnificent.</p>
<p>There is a Stanbaugh in Hollywood who has a lot of military equipment. He also collects a lot of military equipment from ancient times in front of the Paramount Film Company. When film companies need military equipment to shoot war films, they rent it from him. Recently, the demand has surged, and he has made a fortune.</p>
<p>Because various companies have recently been competing to shoot war films, Stanbaugh has been very busy renting out military equipment. Sometimes, a film needs 250 Austrian-style rifles, and the number of Chinese-style rifles required is the same. He also installs smokeless gunpowder in these guns. The inside of the cartridge case is filled with black, fire-starting ammunition. They are used differently for filming during the day or at night.</p>
<p>Even in Union Pacific, although it is not a real war film, when Zomegai led his men to resist the Indian riots, he used 210 rifles, and those thugs were at a disadvantage because they were holding old rifles from before 1863. Similarly, in Heritage of the Desert, there is a scene that uses 50 rifles.</p>
<p>Stanbaugh's biggest deal is to supply hundreds of Spencer-style new guns and all the machine guns in his collection, but the anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery have caused problems. Although the government can help, some of the military equipment must be designed by the film company, so even if it is not formal combat, it will give people a deep impression. When Warner started filming Juarez, the war shots will be filmed in Borpon. They have 400 old-fashioned rifles and some new-style guns, which are enough for the background of this film.</p>
<p>Dodge City, starring Errol Flynn, needs 100 bulky old-style guns and some short-caliber pistols, but there are not enough of them, so the general extras who are not actually fighting all hold fake guns made of rubber.</p>
<p>Stanbaugh's armory has a total of 460 British-made Lee-Enfield rifles, which are recently loaded onto trucks to RKO every day to supply all the war scenes in The Light That Failed for filming.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Recent News from the International Film Scene <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Two months ago, when "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" premiered in the capital of the Netherlands, the audience was extremely crowded, but the local film censorship board prohibited children under the age of 14 from visiting, on the grounds that "the horror scenes in the film are sufficient for children to experience adverse psychological effects." For this reason, the RKO authorities had previously sought the opinion of Walt Disney, the producer of the film, and wanted to delete these so-called "horror scenes," but Walt Disney resolutely refused, saying, "I would rather sacrifice a part of the audience than make the entire audience see something that is untrue and incomplete." So the children of the Netherlands did not have the opportunity to see this film.</p>
<p>Recently, a large number of American films have been banned in Italy, including two, one is "Marie Antoinette" and the other is "The Adventures of Marco Polo," which are also on the list of banned films. The plots and content of these many films have not offended Italy at all. It is only in a film that there is a scene depicting Italians eating pasta. The Italian film censorship board believes that it contains a satirical element, so without asking questions, all films with similar descriptions are banned.</p>
<p>The discrimination against Jewish people in Germany and Italy has been raging in recent months. Unexpectedly, they now want to infringe upon the Jewish actors in Hollywood. Not long ago, the Fascist Party newspaper "Tevere" in Rome said to their people that all the comedy films starring Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, and the Ritz Brothers must be obscene because they are all Jewish, and the Italian people should boycott them.</p>
<p>The war newsreel "Kidli and Spain" jointly produced by Paramount, United Artists, and Universal in Spain has been filmed from the year before last until now and has already reached 120,000 feet. It has recently been decided to reorganize and edit it, remove the dross and keep the essence, divide it into three episodes, and distribute it to various countries for screening.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Hitler and Actresses <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The world-famous German leader Hitler is still a bachelor, but his relationship with women is very close, especially actresses. If you don't believe it, look below.</p>
<p>…Leni Riefenstahl…</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Hitler hates Jews, but there is nothing strange in the world. His lover Leni Riefenstahl is a Jew. Leni is a red star on the screen, the daughter of a blacksmith. In 1923, she began working as a dancer in a dance hall in Munich. Soon she transferred to the film industry. Hitler and she began to know each other at a meeting of a famous musician. Then they began to fall in love. The Minister of the Army, Goering, found out about this romance and advised Hitler not to fall in love with a Jewish woman. But Hitler's answer was, "This is my private life, please don't interfere." As a result, Goering left angrily, and Hitler and Leni's love affair increased rather than decreased, and he hired her to guide photography and skating. A French newspaper once reported that Hitler had fallen into Leni's love net, and said that Leni had criticized Hitler in this way, "On the battlefield, he may be a general, but in the field of love, he is only a child." Hitler was furious when he saw this, so he did not allow this French newspaper to be sold in Germany.</p>
<p>…Marlene Dietrich…</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich is a big star in Hollywood and one of the most internationally renowned German actresses. When Hitler issued the order "All film stars and technicians living abroad must return to the country and make films in the motherland" six years ago, she also returned to Germany. The next day, Hitler sent a special envoy to visit, conveying his kind intentions and saying to her, "Germany welcomes you with open arms and has prepared an excellent position for you, appointing you as the president of German films." Marlene Dietrich only replied faintly, "Thank you." Out of love, Hitler sent people to send flowers to Dietrich every day from the third day, but two months later, the special envoy who sent the flowers suddenly returned the flowers to Hitler, because Dietrich was not used to this kind of life and had quietly embarked on a journey to Hollywood the night before.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Star Chinese Team's Last Match in Hong Kong: 1-0 Victory Over the Chinese Union; Star Chinese Team Fields Many New Players on the Day; Chinese Union Frequently Attacks But Unfortunately Fails <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Star Chinese Football Team played its third match against the Chinese Union at the Caroline Hill ground yesterday at 5:30 PM. The weather suddenly turned cold, and it was not a holiday, so the number of spectators was sparse. The Governor of Hong Kong, Sir 富國, made a special appearance to watch the "final act" and witness the skills of our overseas Chinese players.</p>
<p>The lineup for the Star Chinese team was slightly different from before. The goalkeeper was changed to Zhang Huiwen, the left back was the experienced veteran Deng Yuehan, the right winger was Wu Zhanshi, and since 龍歷武 was absent, Xia Zhixiang filled in. Wu Zhanshi and Deng Yuehan both performed admirably. Deng was known for his familiarity with the middle road, while Wu was known for his quick passing. Goalkeeper Feng Huiwen showed good skills, but was slightly inferior to Li Baitang. Xie Qingfu, the "new Li Huitang," scored a goal with the help of Wu Zhanshi yesterday, ultimately defeating the Chinese Union with a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>Looking at Star Chinese's × games, one always feels that the whole team's progress is slow and the style of play is outdated. Tracing the source, it is all due to the players dribbling too much. Modern tactics all adopt fast passing and dribbling, and a vigorous sprinting style of play. Recalling the performance of the English team Corinthians during their tour, it can be used as a lesson. During the war, the Corinthians players all aimed to obtain the ball as quickly as possible, and then pass it to their teammates. As soon as there was an opportunity, they would sprint or shoot. Since South China's players had several discussions, they imitated Corinthians' M-style formation. In the previous season, South China was able to win the league championship using this strategy. This season, many strong teams in Hong Kong have adopted this strategy, and their results have improved rapidly. Star Chinese's forwards have covering but no sprinting, so the final kick is often blocked by the opponent. At the same time, the shooting skills of Star Chinese's forwards are not yet perfect. Long shots are often inaccurate, and close shots miss the target. Therefore, in the first match against South China, they lost 0-3. Star Chinese had many chances to win on a regular basis, but unfortunately, they were lost due to lack of experience and slowness.</p>
<p>Yesterday's game was an improvement over the first two games. The victory of Star Chinese was due to the fact that the midfielders were not restrained and were able to attack frequently, helping the progress of the forwards. However, throughout the whole game, Hong Kong's United team often had the advantage. The reason why they could not reverse the defeat was because their shooting was inaccurate, and their luck was also not good.</p>
<p>Several players from the Hong Kong Chinese Union team were absent, and their strength was also affected. They were filled in by veterans such as Ye Beihua. After returning from the World Games, Ye had rarely been seen on the field. Yesterday, he put on his uniform again and reprised his skills. However, his skills were rusty and he lacked the strength to perform well. Chen Guangyu made his debut in a major battle and had many flaws, often being rushed past the defense by Wu Zhanshi. He still lacks experience in defense. If he works hard, he will surely become a good player in the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong Chinese Union team was loose and disorganized, with no connection to speak of, and ultimately lost 1-0. Five minutes into the first half, Star Chinese struck quickly. Wu Zhanshi attacked swiftly on the right, unstoppable. When Wu dribbled into the goal area, he immediately swept a shot. Zhang Rongcai turned around and slapped the ball to the corner. Xie Qingfu was in front of the goal and gently pushed it in, opening the scoring with a 1-0 lead. Twelve minutes into the game, Dehui dribbled the ball and attacked. Deng Yuehan collided with him, and the ball went strongly to the right, where it was obtained by Deng Guangshen, who advanced like a rushing wave. However, the final kick was weak and was saved by Zhang Huiwen. Fourteen minutes into the game, Cai Yuehan received a clever pass from Xie Qingfu and shot in front of the goal. Rongcai made a timely save, only conceding a corner kick. Twenty minutes into the game, Shuiyi launched a solo attack, but his shot was saved by Huiwen and landed in front of Guangsen. Guangsen was merciful and slow to act, missing a golden opportunity to score.</p>
<p>Switching sides, the game remained evenly matched. Shi Jin worked extremely hard and frequently launched attacks, but they were all slightly off target and to no avail. The most tense moment was in the third minute, when Hong Kong surrounded the Star Chinese goal. Dehui, Shi Jin, and Beihua all fired shots, but none hit the mark. The fans all sighed. After that, the attack and defense were balanced, and the game was uneventful. Until the end of the game, the Hong Kong Chinese Union lost 0-1. Star Chinese, in its three games, lost twice and won once, completing its mission and will leave Hong Kong tomorrow.</p>
<p>The South China Athletic Association held a banquet at the Guangzhou Restaurant last night at 8:00 PM to welcome the Singapore Chinese team, expressing the hospitality of the host. More than a hundred Chinese and Western guests attended the event, which was extremely lively and continued until late at night. The rosters of both teams are listed below:</p>

<p>The Rong Yip Brand competition, organized by the Hong Kong Small-Sided Football Association, will feature the championship final between Kitchee and Wellington at the Wan Chai Southorn Playground today at 5:00 PM, according to the schedule. Kitchee is the champion of the Chan Dong Cup, and recently eliminated the star-studded Wu Ying team 3-1. Their strength is truly astonishing. However, Wellington is not a weak team either. Every time they play, they pose a serious threat to the Zhang team. Recently, they have also gained the assistance of the small-ball star Cheng, which makes them even more formidable. When the two strong teams meet, it is impossible to predict who will be the champion of the Rong Yip Brand until the very end. The names of the players on both sides are as follows: (Kitchee) Li Zhaorong, You Hua Yu, Zhang Rensheng, Yu Qingyuan, Luo Weijie, Lin De Pu, Luo Zhimin, Deng Riming, Li Da Yi, Huo Yaohua, Yin Zule, Zhu Jincheng, Ye Guoying, Chen Jiali; (Wellington) Li Mulun, Zheng Yingquan, Li Huilin, Deng Songbai, Zhang Xinhan, Lin Huasheng, Chen Jinpei, Chen Cai, Lin You, Zeng Huai, Zhong Wei.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Shanghai Football Association: Amending the Constitution for the Next Session; Seeking Opinions from All Teams for Submission to the Council for Decision; The Group C Champion Will Not Be Produced Due to Field Issues <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Communication] The Shanghai Football Association officially announced the resolutions of the Executive Committee meeting yesterday (31st). For the 1938-39 league season, West Foss won the Group A championship based on the first round robin scoring. Donghua Association won the reserve group championship. The British Navy won the Group B championship. Due to incomplete matches in Group C, it was decided not to produce a champion. Since the British Navy has won the Group B championship, it can be promoted to Group A according to the rules. The fourth-place team in Group A, 震日, will be relegated to Group B. However, the British Navy has frequent personnel changes and inconsistent strength, and may give up this opportunity, which will be taken over by the runner-up North West Children. (According to the 1937-38 season, the Army of Group B abandoned its promotion, and was replaced by the runner-up, 伐亚.) Currently, Lidu is tied for the lead with North West Children, one point ahead. With the strength of Lidu, exclusively occupying the police force, there is no problem. Now, it is regrettable that the schedule cannot be completed and no champion is produced due to the parking of cars at each stadium. However, the club has already won the Scott Cup and the Junior Cup, and the small internal group champion is not significant. In the Executive Committee meeting held the day before yesterday, the proposal to amend the League Constitution for the next season was raised. The Committee decided to announce this proposal to all clubs on April 15, and convene another committee to discuss the opinions of the members' associations, and submit them to the next Council for approval or rejection. (Each member club in the Council has one representative present.)</p>

<p>In the public men's basketball games, two games of Group A and one game of Group B were held in the Qingnianhui gymnasium last night. In the first game of Group A, Hong Kong University vs. South China, the strength of the two sides was very different. South China's defense and offense were consistent. Huang Zuode, Li Jiesheng, Chen Zanyin, and Chen Zandun skillfully scored baskets, and Zhong Ling also attacked relentlessly. Hong Kong University's Zhang Shaomian, Qin Zhangjun, and Xu Kunlun had good long and short-range attacks. Lei Mengdi and Yang Hua were able to calmly respond to the challenge. However, South China's brilliance was fully revealed, with the momentum of Mount Tai pressing on an egg. Hong Kong University tried its best to support itself, but it was ineffective, and it was greatly defeated.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, Huang Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen Zanfu attacked from three directions and all scored. Hong Kong knew that the teachers were coming fiercely, and Zhang Shaomian rose up and Xu Kunlun also made several gains. However, South China made a comeback. Chen Zanfu and Chen Zanyin attacked from the left and right, and Zhong Ling, Huang Zuode, and Li Junsheng intercepted from three directions, spreading good news. Hong Kong University's Yang Xuhua and Lei Menglian fought back from the left and right. Qin Zhangjun and Xu Kunlun engaged in close combat for a long time and recovered several domains. Xu Shaomian also crossed the river on horseback and gained some ground. However, South China launched a surprise attack, and the entire line of Hong Kong University collapsed, losing 39-56.</p>
<p>In the second game, South China faced Guangda. The two sides did not play well. South China was tightly organized, while Guangda's defense was good, but its attack was scattered. South China's Shi Zhenzhi scored successfully, and Shi Zhenyuan and Gan Jiemin made good contributions. Guangda's Wu Yi performed well yesterday, but Zheng Yu missed opportunities frequently, and Lu Jin was quite objective. After the start of the game, Xiao Jiemin was the first to fall into the trap, and Shi Zhenzhi worked together. Wu Zhao launched a counterattack and scored. Zheng Tangkun and Zhang Rongcai intercepted from two directions and did not betray their mission. Liang Jianghong fought repeatedly, and Chen Zhaohui launched an attack. However, South China's military appearance was at its peak. It was seen that the Shi brothers were taking things from the bag. Therefore, Guangda pursued and the points were close. In the first half, South China took the lead with 19-18. Changing sides, Guangda released three arrows in a row and all hit the mark, ascending to 27-24. South China was surrounded by Chu songs, so it mobilized Shi Zhenzhi's reinforcements, which were quite powerful, and scored baskets from near and far. Shi Zhenda and Chen Xiqiu also launched attacks. Guangda's Chen Zhaoxiang launched a counterattack, but the situation had passed. When the gold was struck and the military was dismissed, South China won 56-39.</p>
<p>In the last game, Red Star fought Li Xing. Red Star was not Li Xing's opponent at all. The game became one-sided. After the start of the game, Huang Jiucheng scored 24 points in a row. Red Star only started recording after the counterattack. Li Xing pressed on even harder. At the end of the game, Li Xing easily defeated the Red Star team 107-38. The results of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>(South China)</p>
<p>(Total score 40)</p>
<p>(Guangda)</p>
<p>(Total score 32)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong University)</p>
<p>(Total score 39)</p>
<p>(South China)</p>
<p>(Total score 56)</p>
<p>(Li Xing)</p>
<p>(Total score 107)</p>
<p>(Red Star)</p>
<p>(Total score 38)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Spectators of Ball Games Should Have Three Supplementary Laws <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>(1) Preparation Law: Since we ourselves are interested in watching ball games, it is of course better to be more focused and specialized, such as basketball or football. Then, before a certain game starts, we should have considerable supplementary preparation, filling our minds with knowledge about the ball game. If we don't even know the rules of this kind of game, or how each position should play... how can we talk about criticism and research? Therefore, I think the necessary preparation is not in prediction or criticism... but in how to find the knowledge about the ball game in advance and instill this knowledge into our brains. This is true preparation.</p>
<p>(2) Practice Law: Although we have obtained a lot of knowledge from all sides, is this knowledge correct? We have to practice at the ball field to prove it. We also need to practice a lot, and then we can find out what is right or wrong. Therefore, if we want to increase our ability to observe and criticize ball games, we must not only watch more ball games, but also practice ball games ourselves in order to fundamentally gain the ability to observe and criticize. Therefore, the second law for ball game spectators is the "Self-Practice Law." We must first have the ability to practice or specialize in a certain ball game ourselves, so that we can increase our interest in watching and other things.</p>
<p>(3) If Law: These laws can also be called the satisfaction and annoyance laws. That is, if something is successful (satisfying), we will continue to do it, and the effect will also increase greatly. If we fail, we will be annoyed and unwilling to do it, and the results will decrease accordingly. From this point of view, the third law that we, the people who watch ball games, should have is the "Satisfaction Law." If everyone can always watch the ball game with a satisfied attitude, then the effect obtained will of course be greater than anything else. Because no matter how good or bad the team is, it can satisfy us. Why? For good teams, we can certainly gain a proper understanding and model of techniques, etc., and we can also make corrections on our own side, which makes us satisfied. But bad teams can also give us a negative understanding (what is bad). Since we have obtained a correct concept from other parties, indirectly, we are led to improve in the correct direction from good, so that our skills reach perfection. This is also a definite place. Therefore, the third law for us to watch ball games is to exchange the spirit of research for "satisfaction." Therefore, when we watch ball games, we should have the concept that - regardless of whether the teams playing are good or bad, we should have two views: "What is good and where is it good," and "What is bad and where is it bad." We can increase our willingness to prepare and practice more if we get satisfaction from watching ball games, prepare more fully, and practice more effectively. The better the effect, the more satisfaction. Because we are satisfied, we will definitely increase our will to do and our spirit of practice. If everyone can do this, it will be easy to revitalize the sports of the Hong Kong compatriots, and the sports cause will be more optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Rebirth of Poetry <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xianwen</p>
<p>Following the unfolding of the war of resistance in the past twenty months, and the rapid changes in social reality, poetry, which is considered the most direct way to convey emotions and experiences of life, and which sensitively reflects social activities (including political issues), and whose effect of arousing emotional resonance is more effective and faster than novels, this "literary weapon" has also clearly appeared in another posture, and the emergence of this posture also contains countless progressive factors.</p>
<p>What kind of poetry were we reading yesterday? — Poets wrote poems like "The azaleas are red, oh, the heart of a young woman?" or poems like "Although it is warm in the sun now, but, oh, west wind, because of, desolate grass and yellow leaves, pity each other!" As for those poems with obscure artistic conceptions and skillfully woven sentences arranging words like "camel bells, yellow sand," and the more progressive poems, they sang "life flows like a muddy river," etc.; but today, we can only find these poems in people's old papers, and their place in newspapers and periodicals has been replaced by emerging poems. The emerging poets sing of new strength, the strength of battle, capturing the transformation of social reality, adding a strong smell of gunpowder between the lines, strengthening the emotions of agitation, and these emotions are also appearing in a new posture.</p>
<p>Like other arts, poetry also follows history; yesterday, reflecting the realistic factors of society, poetry took the expression of individual feelings and the feelings of a specific group as its highest task. However, that kind of social reality quickly became the past. Since a new era has arrived, poets have seized the needs of the new social reality and expressed poetry with their own clear worldview and pure emotions, just like the poems of past heroes who denied the magical heavenly kingdom, like proletarian poetry that denied bourgeois poetry, the emerging poets also deny the paradigms of previous poetry, appearing with a brand new formation to complete the higher historical task of the current unique society.</p>
<p>However, the fact that poetry denies the paradigms of the past and develops a new path does not mean that it rejects all previous interpretations of poetry. For example, Tolstoy, who valued emotion, emphasized that poetry is a tool for conveying emotions, and it is a means for spiritual union, which is still applicable now and will also be applicable in the future. Each new form of poetry develops along a certain criterion, but this does not mean that we should use poetry to convey any emotion, such as those extremely personal atmospheres in the past or the emotional clichés that can only express the feelings of a specific group, because they have been replaced by the higher emotions created by the realistic factors of the current stage of society, and have lost the driving force for historical development at the current stage. On the contrary, this is enough to become an obstacle to the progress of the times, so it is meaningless to express it in poetry.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people believe that poets at the current stage should also abandon the romantic style that is most suitable for expressing personal emotions. There are different opinions regarding this interpretation; Gorky, to a certain extent, supported romanticism. We know that positive romanticism can strengthen people's will to live, can awaken people's resistance to the oppression of stubborn reality, and not like those in the past who pulled people from reality to the illusory world, did not take a critical attitude towards reality, but only indulged in elusive ideas, and as a result, still made people indulge in negative thinking and no positive action.</p>
<p>Poetry has a new future in present-day China. It is taking the same steps as other spiritual cultures, stepping on living reality. It must abandon the emotional dregs of the era and replace them with new ones, and use a clear worldview to promote the progress of social reality through the form of poetry.</p>
<h3 id="e80">"Spring" <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Some people love the season of yellow leaves fluttering and fallen flowers covering the ground. Walking leisurely in the path in the setting sun of autumn, sitting with their own lonely shadows; or sitting idly in the courtyard, gazing at the yellow fences, leisurely counting the fallen flowers, but people say, "This is too old and late in life, young people should not be so aloof from the world." However, it is said that the poet's wise eyes can still see "life" in autumn.</p>
<p>There are also people who love the cold winter, a vast expanse of white snow, a world of glass. It is said that this is also the temperament of a poet, and even more the character of a hero. My thoughts then galloped in the wilderness, the plains, and the icy and snowy land. What is the state of mind of the fighters who are doing great work? Cursing or appreciation? Let the facts fill in the answer!</p>
<p>But I, an ordinary and mediocre person, long for spring, a vibrant and energetic season!</p>
<p>A voice sounded in my ear; "Spring is coming!" I don't know who whispered to me so softly. The tone is so gentle and harmonious. Adding fuel to the fire, it will surely become a moving love song. But I said faintly: "There is no spring here." Perhaps indignant at this indifferent attitude, there was no reply, and the footsteps of the visitor gradually disappeared into the distance.</p>
<p>Pushing open the window, I looked up. The sky was gray and dark, filled with dark clouds. A gust of wind blew today, could it be bringing the news of spring? I wondered, but what came towards me was a pungent smell of blood, not the breath of spring. "There is no spring here," I murmured again. I hurriedly closed the window.</p>
<p>Sailing on a boat of reverie, drifting on the sea of memory; all winter, I recited Shelley's famous line, "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Yes, spring will be coming soon. But now, winter is gone, but there is still no spring here.</p>
<p>Peanut trees, flocks of birds flying around. A scene of warmth and a charming landscape, also easy to make people yearn for, but the fields of Jiangnan, no, the entire land, is no longer peaceful and solemn, demons have brought great disturbances. The plains are dotted with ruins; broken walls and remnants, bloody corpses, violated girls, suffering children. May I ask, is this a symbol of spring?</p>
<p>I tell you: "There is no spring here!"</p>
<p>However, oh, I still want to tell you: "Spring will come." After the sweat of cultivation and the irrigation of blood, the earth will return to spring, and the fields will ripple with intoxicating spring breeze.</p>
<p>But, before it's over, I want to ask you, "How will you sweat and bleed for the earth—our mother?"</p>
<p>"Hey, tell me, tell me!"</p>

<h3 id="e82">Stealing the City <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Du Youhui</p>
<p>It was an autumn evening, and a biting north wind was already blowing in this central plain area. The sky was dark and cloudy, and our army had moved to a new defensive line in the suburbs to garrison. That evening, our army was preparing to launch a counterattack on the small city, because the headquarters had received intelligence that the enemy had suffered heavy casualties in the hard fighting in recent days, and now only more than 300 people were left guarding the city, waiting for reinforcements.</p>
<p>At one o'clock in the morning, the troops of our army moved out. The brothers of the 9th Company of our army were dispersed and surrounded the city from various small roads. They crawled like black ants in the silent wilderness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud "Boom!" and "Rumble!" explosion shattered the silence of the night sky, followed by a burst of machine gun fire and hand grenades. There was a clamor of killing, running, and wailing in the city. The order in the city was obviously very chaotic!</p>
<p>At this time, it was reported that our army had reached the suburbs. They still thought that the enemy had discovered our army's attack. But after a while, the gunfire gradually thinned out, until it disappeared. However, on the city wall, a national flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun was suddenly erected, vaguely fluttering in the night sky.</p>
<p>"Our troops have occupied the city!" the company commander said.</p>
<p>"Which troop is it?" the brothers asked, but there was no answer. Everyone was wondering who this elusive troop was.</p>
<p>"Could it be an empty city ploy by the enemy!" one brother said.</p>
<p>"Heavens!"</p>
<p>"No—it can't be, didn't you see that the city gate is already open? There are even people singing 'March of the Volunteers' on the gate!" the company commander said with great certainty. The sentry returned and confirmed the news, so we marched into the city.</p>
<p>"I wonder which troop entered first?" This question has not been answered, and it is revolving in the minds of every brother.</p>
<p>Our army entered the city. On the road lay some corpses of Japanese soldiers and countless abandoned guns and techniques, scattered here and there.</p>
<p>The troops of our army assembled. The regimental commander stood in front of the troops and spoke:</p>
<p>"Brothers! Who do you think was the troop that first attacked and entered here tonight?" Everyone was silent. He continued: "It is this group of young soldiers who grew up in the enemy's artillery fire!…" He pointed his finger at the group of refugee teenagers who were accompanying the army on the side. They were probably between six or seven and fifteen or sixteen years old. "They are so young! But their understanding of the war of resistance is deeper and more resolute than anyone else! They know that it is better to be on the front line with their fathers and brothers than to be slaves of a fallen province. They are willing to carry leather boxes of bullets for their fathers and brothers, share the hardships of their fathers and brothers, and may even be able to help fight the enemy. Tonight, this heroic and commendable act is a good example of them…… Tonight, more than a dozen of these young soldiers automatically sneaked into the city before our troops left the city, using hand grenades to bombard the enemy. The enemy thought that our army had attacked the city in the middle of the night. They shot at each other in the dark, and as a result, they only killed their own people, so they were in a chaotic mess, and fled out of the city……" At this point, the brothers laughed.</p>
<p>"I feel very heartbroken! And ashamed! Because I cannot give these useful children the opportunity to receive education, and make them live a life on the battlefield of exile…… At the same time, we also feel very fortunate! Because from the actions of this group of young soldiers, it is enough to see the bright future of the Chinese nation. China has countless such young soldiers, and China will not perish! The glorious responsibility of China's future lies with this group of future masters to complete it!… Brothers! We want to pay a solemn salute to this group of young soldiers……"</p>
<p>Our entire team was ecstatic. We embraced this group of young soldiers amidst the cheers of "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!" and the singing of "March of the Volunteers." Our anti-Japanese spirit was all inspired by this heroic and ingenious behavior!</p>
<p>This night. The people in this city spent it warmly in the crucible of a nation.</p>
<p>Note: What is written in this article is all true. It is a fact witnessed by the head of the military service group who returned from Changsha. This group of refugee children from the military are all from the occupied areas, and they came out with their fathers and brothers. They are unwilling to leave their fathers and brothers, so that they can set off together. Until recently, the authorities paid attention to transporting these children to the rear for centralized training. These are the new anti-Japanese army that is coming. Their anti-Japanese ability and consciousness are naturally more heroic than today's soldiers.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Get out of here, you dog, stay away from me!"</p>
<p>She scolded him, and he couldn't help but revert to the naivety of his childhood, and moved closer to her, grabbing her sleeve;</p>
<p>"You're not allowed to scold anymore!"</p>
<p>"Let go of me, you dog!"</p>
<p>"I don't care if you scold me, I'll slap you in the face if you scold me again!"</p>
<p>"Get lost, I'm not afraid of you, I'm telling you, you dog!"</p>
<p>"Then I'll tear your clothes to pieces and freeze you!"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of freezing, not afraid of freezing!"</p>
<p>"I'll leave you with not a shred of clothing on, standing naked on the road."</p>
<p>She might not be afraid of the cold, but she was afraid of shame; so she didn't dare say:</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of shame, not afraid of shame!"</p>
<p>Instead, she retorted:</p>
<p>"Your family must not have any sisters, you don't have a mother, you were sewn out of a crack in the rock!"</p>
<p>At this point, he failed—descending into the boredom of a game that had been forgotten. He let go of her sleeve, and moreover, apologized to her.</p>
