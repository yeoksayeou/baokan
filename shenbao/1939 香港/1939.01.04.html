<h3>戰後各路航綫　輪隻統計　英佔首佔第二　內港尚有團輪行駛</h3>

<h3>巴黎蠟人館觀光記</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>記得那時繼十幾歲吧、我在教科書上讀了一篇很動人的文章、那便是薛福成氏所做的「巴黎觀油書記一、內中述及在巴黎蠟人館中曾經看到一幅普法戰爭的油畫描摹當時法國戰敗的忍慘情形、用意是來激發人民愛國復仇的情緒、大概的意思是如此、詳細的內容已忘却了、雖然那時年紀很小、不能體會這篇又章的　、　可是「巴黎蠟人館」這個名詞、却留給我一個很深的印象、此次我到了巴黎、便向朋友們打聽如何前去、朋友們說、「你是受了薛福成文章的影響嗎」、我說「正是如此』、原來在巴黎的中國人、十之八九都是因了這篇文章而去的、一篇文章留給人們的印象、竟生出一種不可思議的魔力、也可見文字影響之深了、</p>
<p>蠟人館在蒙馬林蔭街十號、（10．BoulevardMontmarlre）這一帶是巴黎奴樂場所薈萃之區、略如上海的　飛路、而蠟人館便在其中佔了小小的一角地方、蠟人館的名詞、在法國稱爲格雷文博物院（Musee　Cr＇yelli）、是紀念創辦人格雷文氏的、進門以後、買了一張八佛郎的入門、內中光線昏暗、最先接觸于我的眼簾的、是一間電影公司的攝影塲、導演正在指揮拍戲、登塲的人物有一個比較熟識的、是克雷泰加賽、第二室裏是法國的當代名人、如勞翁勃萊、達拉第等等、其餘如各國航空名人、運動名手等也各分佔一室、第五室是一幅驚心動魄的西班牙戰事寫真、政府軍正在一個教堂裏抵抗、兩個人執了步槍、一個人架了機關槍、另外兩個人已經倒在地上、奄奄一息了、教堂裏還懸兩只大鐘、佈景逼眞、神情畢肖、很令人想到西班牙內戰的慘酷、看了他們又聯想到自己的國家、不禁發生無窮的感慨、</p>
<p>世界政治舞台的重要角色、蠟人館所選的、僅有當代獨裁者希特勒、墨索里尼、史丹林三人、其餘如美國總統羅斯福、英國首相張伯倫等皆未入選、也許蠟人館認爲支配目前世界的、就祇有這三大巨頭吧、史丹林正在抽烟斗、墨索里　舉着手、希特拉正在束皮帶、彼此的神情各殊、最近有一位意大利人遊覺到墨索里尼的像前、因爲痛恨他達於極點、竟致舉槍自殺、陳戶階下、也可見蠟人館給予人們的刺激了</p>
<p>因爲英皇不久要來、所以蠟人館裏也新添了英皇及后的御象、這算是應時的點綴、此外化樓下的、尚有時裝店的內景、以及名優的表演、但比較值得一看的、是文豪囂俄的一雙手、迄手是用白石琢成的、旁邊附有囂俄寫給格雷文的親筆信和他生前所用的一支鵝毛筆、地下室裏多半是關於革命故事、內中滿佈着監獄、殺人、法庭的情形、　火熒熒、森然可怖、這大概就是所謂「恐怖時代」吧！著名的羅蘭夫人也正在受審、羅蘭夫人有句名言、就是：「自由自由、多少罪惡借汝以行之」、它當然也是一個犧牲者、</p>
<p>法國的暴君路易十六被　囚的地方、也有一幕逼眞的描寫、一七九二年十二月二十五日、路易十六所發的罪已詔書、也有原件貼在一旁、他在一七九三年一月二十日被殺、在斴頭台的一幕有一幅圖畫、（不是蠟象）描摹得很淸楚、身首異處、鮮血四　、這便是一代暴君的歸宿了、其餘摹法國歷史方面的蠟象很多、又有一處、是闡明耶穌一生重要事蹟的、共分五室、因爲時間不多、也無暇一一細看了、</p>
<p>除了蠟人而外、它還保留着不少的重娑文獻及史料、我看見一幅佈告、是格黎安尼（Calleni）將軍署名的、上面說、「現時政府西遷、本人奉命堅守巴黎、自當遵令誓死不渝、特此佈告、」寥寥數語、十足表現到當日巴黎恐慌的一幕、佈告的日期是九月三日、想來是一九一四年的事了、另外一幅佈告、是德軍佔領里哀、（Liege）後所發布的、大意是、「本軍到此後、已槍殺莠民一百十人、如有他人不遵本軍命令、必定槍殺勿赦、』措詞傲慢、不難想見那時德軍的凶暴、和法國人民反抗的情緒了、又有一處、陳列大戰時奪得德國的戰利品、內有鉛質的齊泊林遺骸、按大戰時德國　泊林飛船在巴黎上空、曾經擲了不少的炸彈、這是至今巴黎人民所最最難忘的一件　、</p>
<p>我在大廳裏走了些時、看見有一個女子坐在長椅的角上（這是備遊客坐的）、又有一個老人止坐着閱報、我也未加注意、後來兜了圈子回來、他們依然坐着、我因走得很累、也坐在一旁、正想和那位閱報的老者閒談、那知細細一看、竟也是個蠟人、再看那女子、原來也不是真人、這是在倫敦蠟人館裏所看不到的新鮮玩意、因爲　會疑心在遊客坐椅上也有蠟人呢、我再留心四處看　、忽然發現坐在樓上、欄杆上笑着向下望一位士兵、以及止在酣睡的管事員、全是蠟人、於是眞眞假假、必須要十分留神方纔辨得淸楚、</p>
<p>正在看得出神的時候，忽然鈴聲大　、由來蠟人館中所附設的魔術場以及水晶宮開始表演了、大家　擁上樓、先走進一個小小劇塲、由一位魔衛家表演了幾套魔術、在每一套魔術表完演畢之後、他把所有內容、告訴了觀客、末了、他勸顧客們買他的書、以及自己便可練習、臘人館忽然有魔術表演、似乎有些逾越範圍了、况且所表演的，也是。分平凡約摸過了十五分鐘、魔術完了、接上來便是水晶宮，遊客們到了一間四面全是玻璃的房子、裏面用各種的燈光來點級着、時紅時綠、時多時寡、於是人在室裏、便看見玻璃之中、反射出千千萬萬的燈光、一陣黑暗雜着轟轟的雷嗚、原來表示天在下雨了、又有表示下雪的、種種不同的情形、都利用燈光來顯示、雖然沒有多少意義、然而，小孩子們來看看，的確也可感到相當興趣、又可聯想到光學的應用、這於啓發兒童的智慧，不無相當裨益，魔術室及水晶宮約每二小時開放一次、這可算是臘人館的題外文章了」　薛福成所說的普法戰爭、油畫早已換去了、它所陳列的東四、時常更換、上年陳列的長城戰事、現在也沒有了、我在幕色蒼茫中避別了這兒的印象深的巴黎蠟人館、重　踏上了紫華的蒙馬德街頭、</p>

<h3>記者公會昨發宣言　擁護中央抗戰到底　反對汪氏及一切主和謬論　請中央盡量剷除動搖份子</h3>
<p>香港中國新聞記者公會、以汪精衝突于我國抗戰開展期中、發出艷電、措詞謬妄、易滋世惑、特于昨二日開第三次執監聯席會、一致通過擁護中央抗戰到底、反對汪精衛主和建議、决發宣言、幷斥其妄、各情業見昨報、該宣言書、業經草竣、文云、</p>
<p>我國七七蘆溝僑事變時，中樞當局、卽曾鄭重宣言、指陳</p>
<p>抗戰局面　旣經開展、卽無中途妥協之理、如中途妥協、即爲滅亡、此言此意、官民上下、持之彌堅、久而未渝、良以×人對我使略、原有其一貫政策、我抬堅决不屈、持久作戰、卽無以撲滅其陰謀、而在過去抗戰程途中、歷時凡十月、我方形勢、已漸進展至有陛段、最近×軍以傷亡慘重、整理補充、無力進犯、國際間空氣、亦同時有鮮明之變換、對我表示異常好意、因是言之、我苟能繼續堅持、必使×人屈膝、若在此時、播散和議妖言、萌生妥協歪念、悉足搖動國本、爲×張目、吾人必須力予駁斥、毋任播流、淆亂視聽、邇者×閥近衛文磨、以處境困難、遂播</p>
<p>和科煙幕　顧其眞意、匪祇狂謬絕倫、抑且陰狡萬狀、我中樞領袖業已一一加以嚴重痛斥、使其陰謀狡計、暴露無遺、故所謂近衛聲明、徒屬×人侵我、捨軍事而外、又一更毒更辣之花樣、凡爲中國人之愛國者、悉應深惡痛絕、洞燭其奸、乃前中央副總裁汪精銜氏、竟在此時突然擅離職　、匿跡異地、發表建議、爲×嚮應、替×張目、吾人認定汪氏此舉、實屬倒行逆　、危撼國本、無論其如何構意措詞、悉無任何眞理、矧汪氏過去亦爲黨國重要之一員、其所言行、最易使人誤解、今忽有此</p>
<p>背叛民意　破壞抗戰之主張、匪特足以毀滅其個人過去之歷史、亦足措國家於萬刦不復，吾人認汪氏此次之所謂建議、與其謂爲欲闢東亞和平之門、母寧謂爲通×求降、欲將整個抗戰優勢搖撼、而屈膝於×人之　、且×閣之狂謬聲明、旣經蔣委員長之一一痛斥、眞意暴露、卽三尺孩童亦足洞燭其奸、自無待汪氏之任何建識、汪氏旣爲中央之一要員、自不能謂爲無睹無聞，乃竟曲意文飾</p>
<p>顛倒黑白　司馬昭心、何去何從自難　請議、昨中央執監曾議、認定「汪氏此種行動、其爲違反紀律、危害黨國、實已昭然若揭、大義所在、斷難姑息、宣卽决議永速開除其黨籍、幷撤除其一切職務』、吾人認定中央此舉、實爲當機立斷、凡屬國民、必當絕對擁護、同時、吾人更認定汪氏此次背叛黨國、倒行逆施、固爲抗戰程途中最不幸情形、而在　方面言之、又實足使我抗戰形勢、更趨明朋、是則今後我國抗戰、自必較前更有把握、吾人在此時期、亟須一心一德、擁護中央</p>

<h3>願死者的鮮血滌云政治上的污點</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>葉端人追悼會紀　香港各社團將籲請粵當局整飭綱紀</p>
<p>花圈，輓聯，淸淸素素地漫着凄　肅穆的氣氛。昨天下午一時，在中華藝術協進會主持上，本港文化界和各社團很悲痛地追悼葉端人先生。</p>
<p>原來，葉端人是該會的常務理事，曾在港新聞界服務多年，是一位很前進的靑年作家，數月前率領香港西江七縣同鄉會囘國服務　團，前赴西江一帶從事救亡工作，頗著腎勞。最近以雲浮縣民衆自衛團紀率會　之邀，担任該團政治指導員。上月中旬，因公由雲　赴新興，詎料在×機狂炸中，當地不法軍人，竟乘機將葉君財物掠去，幷刺殺滅口，遂遇害逝世。</p>
<p>中華　協會，西江七縣同鄉會，印刷工會，南洋惠僑救鄉團，會寧同鄉會，中華書局仝人……等團體，以及杜其，章等先生，都有凄切悲壯的輓聯，像　協同人的是：</p>
<p>「民族到了最後關頭，糾集海外賢豪，請纓囘國君領前鋒，詎料天職未完薯隴身埋名不杇；戰爭才是轉階段，喚起國中羣衆，奮袂攘×，誰甘落伍，趁此人心愈礪，穗城血洗×終殲。」</p>
<p>印刷工會第三支部中華書局全體同人的輓詞亦是至情的流露：</p>
<p>『不死於×人的炮火而死於漢好的毒手，烈士何時瞑目？</p>
<p>爲祖國生存而奮鬥，爲民族解放而犧牲，忠羲貫澈雲霄。』</p>
<p>君的遺像掛在國旗與總理遺像的下面，看來是很年靑，淸秀而和藹。在黑白色的輓聯與淸素的花圈襯托出來的國旗，亦越是顯示鮮　的瀕色。</p>
<p>在行禮默哀的時候，追悼者都心酸地緬想這是苦難的時代的一個縮影，同時亦爲着更多的死難將士與遭難的同胞致其崇高的敬意。</p>
<p>藝協會主席杜其章献花圈與致詢。這樣的一篇祭文又早打動人們的心欣：</p>
<p>維中華民國廿八年一月三日香港中華藝術協進會全體會員謹以生花輓聯致祭於葉君端人同志之　前日：</p>
<p>爲了國家民族的生存，你不斷的拚命；</p>
<p>爲了文化建設的偉業，你不斷的呼號！</p>
<p>你的一個咀巴，駕倒了多少無恥的×人。</p>
<p>你的一雙健腿，踢走了多少卑污的小醜。</p>
<p>你的一枝銳筆，刺國了多少頹廢的敗類。</p>
<p>啊！，你，你是民族的戰士，是文化界的先鋒！</p>
<p>人類，民族，正需要你，期待你，期待你的努力——成功！</p>
<p>何期，那一顆爲全中華民族所痛恨的虐彈，兗穿洞了你的心胸，結束了你的偉業？</p>
<p>現在，烽火遍華南，正要你和我們一同踏步前進，誰知我們行列中，弱了你這個勇士！</p>
<p>我們明白，現在我們死的機會是多着，你不過是先碰了機會的一個。</p>
<p>我們明白，你雖死，精神是永生的，你的偉業並未因你的死而停止。</p>
<p>我們在你靈前發誓，願踏着你的血跡前進！爲你復仇！亦爲了整個民族解放的鬥爭！</p>
<p>勝利日益接近我們了，請你含笑安　吧！</p>
<p>魂兮歸來，長議祖國之河山！尚饗！</p>
<p>潘範菴先生滿懷悲憤的情緒報告葉君的史略。先叙述葉君來港從事文化工作的努力與回國服務而　難的經過。最末，提出葉君的優點勉勵後死者傲效：一，是興世無權利之爭，可是爲了眞理與正義則奮勇必爭；二，求學熱心，社會就是學校；臨死時仍握着書本。</p>
<p>演說的有中華藝協會代表黃楚靑馮勁持和余所亞；印刷業工會代表林光甫君，和　他社團代表多人。會寧同鄉會代表更說得汪汪淚下。會場空氣益加凄楚。</p>
<p>陸浮君的演講亦很激昂地引起人家的共鳴，他說：（一）死本來是很平常的；流血犧牲亦是爭取勝利必需付與的代價。可是，在現在抗戰到了最嚴重最緊張的時候，國家正最需要他工作的時候，他是不該死的。（二）葉君平常很絨默，事實因此有人識笑他的勇氣不够。可是，他現在已經英勇地囘國參加抗戰了，且更英勇地爲參加抗戰而犧牲了，我們留在香港的朋友想起來是感到何等的慚愧和悲痛。（三）抗戰一年半了，可是政治機構還不能改良，政治教育還萬分不够，這對整個抗戰前途是有着極軍大的影響的。葉君不是死於×人炮火之下，而是寃死於自己不法軍人的毒辣之手。、葉君個人的不幸固然使我們十分同惰與痛惜，而寃死的原因——戰時後方政治危機之潛伏，却是絕不容我們忽視，而急需以最大的力量去改進的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>演講之後，繼以悲憤地，熱烈地討論。結果，除决議組織紀念委員會從事慰問家屬，搜集文存外，還致通過聯合香港各團體，籲請廣東省府新主席嚴辦兇手，　卹死者家屬。並須積極整飭網紀，保障華僑囘國服務之定全。</p>
<p>花了三四個鐘點參加這個肅穆，悲憤的追悼會。在歸途中，默祝葉君之鮮血滌淸政治上的污點。一，市內一瞥</p>
<h3>將在為燼中生長的惠州　返惠紀行之四</h3>
<p>一，市內一瞥</p>
<p>【本報特約旅行通訊】現在的惠州，已在靑天白日旗的照耀下了。</p>
<p>惠州的　復·據各方的調查，經過是這樣的：當×人撤退的幾天，禁止着居留城裏的小部順民們出入，到十二月七日，更命令東新橋附近的居民一律遷到中山公園裏去，被命令遷徙的居民，以爲將遭受殺戮或焚燒的毒刑，集中囚禁在中山紀念堂內，都驚慄至亳無血色，面面相覷。及後隆然幾聲，麗動大地，方知道是破壞東新，近秀，圍通等幾道橋樑。那天晚上，×人便悄悄地撤退了。臨去時還帶走了幾名意籍和德籍的教士，焚毀三五架自用的車輛。附城和黃洞等鄉的自衛團隊　知了×人撤退，遂由隊長黃叔蘭，黃植三等率領入城。可是自衛團本抵達之先，城裏的歹徒也知道了消息，串約了近城的土匪入城，大肆搶刦。於是縣城水東路廣毒堂一段，和府城同仁堂一段，未被×人燒去的商號，又在士展的手上焚燒。許多被×人刦餘的財物，又在土匪的手裏搶盡。兩重浩刦，便把專州化爲灰燼之場。及自衛團隊看見城裏炙天的火光，趕到圍擊，匪徒們始倉皇遁去。而東江游擊司令部和四五三旅的隊伍也啣尾而至，全持地方的治安。這次敵人的撤退也相當的秘密，假如發覺稍早，將使他們的「皇軍」大半的覆沒在東江的途上。據游擊司令部的報告，在羅浮山和福田時，仍被我游擊隊中途襲擊，有相當的死亡。煙燄中的惠州，也換取得一部的代價了。</p>
<p>惠州市內殘敗的景象，若非神經麻木了的人，多少有點辛酸。縣城悠畏的水東路，五百餘間的店舖中，已有四百餘間在火燄中　滅了。破爛的鐵門，垂垂欲倒的高扉，和焦黑的棟樑，間間一樣，辨別不出那間是什麽字號。在那些瓦礫中久立了一刻，會聞到濃　的惡臭，原來有許多瘦死的貓狗和給×人殺的猪鷄的屍體狼藉在街邊，配着店中生了霉的衣物，所以發出了難聞的氣息。至於市郊黃塘橋，岡布頭等處還留着幾具腐化了的人屍，浸在水裏，最近才收埋了去。</p>
<p>市內火災的區域很廣。縣城水東道，鹹魚街，塘下全部；府城萬石路，十字街，金帶街一部，總共得六百間，佔全市戶口百分之四十，而且是商業最富盛，最繋華的地方。啊，遭算是拜×人的特別厚賜了·</p>
<p>公共建築物雖未焚燒，但多教殘破不堪。×人似乎有點天生的獸性，他們很喜歡把我們認爲最隆重的地方，做他們最骯髒的處所。像惠州公園的中山紀念堂便是他們的馬廐了。我們要的如何洗刷這種恥辱—痛心的更有橫亘着東江江上的東新大橋，長達五六百尺，完成不及半年，隨着民族的厄運而作了壯烈的犧牲，崩毀於×人的爆炸下。現在巨大的　面倒枕在綠波中，雄偉而殘破了的姿態留給人們以悲傷和憤怒。</p>
<p>二，新惠州的創立</p>
<p>感於國破家亡的　痛·許多重返家鄉的市民都有着另一番的意志，另一番的决心，固然要抗拒×人，同時也要在灰燼中建立起新的世界。天元，惠波……許多茶樓店號復了業·其他雖然沒有完整的舖子，也用檯椅擺在街邊做着生意；而從各鄉來的小担子也很多。十字街，門口每天自農至晚異常的熱鬧，不過物價很貴，來源也相當的稀少，同時黨政軍各界合組的善後委員會也出現了，委員會之下還設立了洽安。救濟，　生，……特種委員會。</p>
<p>本來在一次浩劫之後，一切的環境自與昇平時期不同。昇平時期各項工作還有舊的制度基礎可循，且可利用民間的財力，推行或易。但歷刦以後，民力已疲，民財已盡，尤其舊的制度多已摧毀，在這混亂而枯竭的狀態中。非有精幹賢明的畏官，和刻苦任勞的地方人士共同合作，恐難收效。善後委員會的前途，首先便在這裏决定了。</p>
<p>紛亂，差不多是戰後地方必呈的現象。就軍事方面視察，集中惠洲市內的過去有自衛團，游擊隊，義勇軍，及×××師，×××旅的正規軍，不下數千人，穿着便衣，配着短槍，掛着臂牽的民衆武裝戰士，隨處都可會到，最近才派遣分駐各區去了。因爲隊伍的紛亂，對于地方的治安也蒙受了相當的影響。至少可以使一般的匪徒假冒服裝名目，乘機竊發。所以游擊隊的統一和整理，實爲加强游擊力量的要素。記者二十七日會見×區游擊司令官駱鳳翔時，駱司令官也發表一段警闢的理論和確切的辦法，容後另交詳述。</p>
<p>自經過不斷的焚刦，居留城裏和新近歸來的民衆都有資格稱作災黎。他們雖有了破碎的家，却沒有衣和食。一家數口，瑟縮在頹落的門口，眞是一幅新的流亡圖了。幸現在政府和地方機關正進行着賑濟工作，省府慰問團也於日前到來。中山公園·縣一中，六度庵設有三個施粥處，每天每處受施數達二三千人。看他們提着破舊的竹筐，老的扶着少的，壯的携着幼的，走在瓦礫堆上，一步一步的着，沒有聲息，着淚珠，結成一條長長的隊伍，眞的一陣心痛。可是中華民挨的兒女是在艱苦中生長起來的，我們不能嘆息，我們不能流淚，我們祇有用自己的血和力去創造新的天地，新的惠州。</p>
<p>二十七日於專州</p>

<p>— 龍溪</p>
<p>目前，在許多淪陷區域中，我們的×人正在做着消滅中國文化工作。步驟是先消滅中國歷史，以次及於一切中國書籍，最後是根絕中國文字。手段的惡毒，用不着講，而目前的主要問題，却在如何粉碎×人的陰謀。有人主張用「游擊式的文字宜傳』，目的要做到一地失人民在」的地步。筆者以爲這是一種消極的方法，充其量不過使淪陷區人民，暫時不做×人奴隸而已。至於積極的方法，却是怎樣使×人不能佔有其地，或最低限度，使其不能收受實惠，甚至不能安枕，謂種方法是甚麼？便是加强淪陷區的抵抗能力。</p>
<p>我們看到，在我們幾次嚴正表示抗戰到底，决不中止之後，敵人方面，也會有「長期戰爭」的類似表示·筆者且敢　言其確已實行，至於怎樣實行，簡單說，就是以中國的人力物力支持×人的侵華軍事，也就是日本人所謂的以華制華，其中最具體的最毒辣的手段，不外就地抽稅抽壯丁，與開發富源。這樣×人儘可高踞　上，眼看中華民族一槍一刀，自殺自砍，在×人該是多麼寫意，而在我們身受者方面，則只須一思偽軍被驅上前綫的光景，也就不寒而慄了。何况今天可見到東北僞軍，安知明大就沒有蘇皖新成僞軍出現？×人旣已在此等地域着手抽丁抽稅，自然也沒有抽而不用的道理。等到敵人用大批僞軍，大量中國物力，來和我們做消耗戰時，我們長朋抗戰自然要因這樣毒辣手段而受影響。</p>
<p>不過情勢之所以如此，主要的是由於淪陷區內缺少能和×人對抗的人，否則絕不會任×人爲所欲爲。就筆者所知，冀魯兩省淪陷時，曾有不少熱血靑年留在當地。後來，這些人大多號召起許多不甘做奴隸的民衆，而組成了驚人的游擊勢力，在山西方面，因事後的努力，更有良好的成績表現，最近兩月來，僅山西一地。×軍傷亡，已不下兩萬人，冀魯各地，也是捷報頻傳。總之在失地中，凡是抗敵工作做得努力的省分，都是×人最感痛苦的地方：一方須以强大兵力鎭壓，一方仍不斷有重大損失，而抽稅抽丁，開發富源等夢想，則無實行可能。</p>
<p>由此，可見遊擊工作的重要。筆者於此，熱望一般有爲靑年，在沒有讀書機會與其他工作機會時，最好分途到淪陷區去。因爲目前見到這點的。人們還不多，少數見到了的責任實在格外加重。至於工作的主要原則，則不外使×人時時須以大量兵力，保有最小佔領區域，一方旣難片刻安枕，一方則無絲毫收獲。這樣，×人軍事的進展，只是此例的增加自己的痛苦，增加自己的負担，而同時則减輕了侵略的力量。於是侵略愈瘋狂，崩潰期也就愈近。</p>
<p>因此，筆者最後要反覆高呼：「爲了國家民族的生存，數千年歷　的存續，希望一般目前尙無適當工作的靑年，到淪陷區去！」</p>
<h3>新年有咸</h3>
<p>— 陶行知</p>
<p>除夕除了新秦檜，拜年想拜趙老太（註一）。可喜溢屏成國屏，（註二）擲出金鐲殺妖怪。</p>
<p>註一：趙老太係游擊隊的母親趙洪文國，最近去南　。她老人家是一個大鄉俚，爲了不願做亡國奴，拋棄了家庭，犧牲了一切，帶領了兒孫三代去打游擊。她的兒子趙侗現在東北平津各地，還有大部份的人馬正在截擊敵人。</p>
<p>註二：九龍中華兒童書院二年級小學生李溢屏，年齡祇有八歲，家中並非富有，他看到國家危難，毅然同父母商量，把他家裏的所有，献給國家。第一次在二六年獻金運動的時候，把他母親一生的積蓄——金鐲獻出，第二次在去年雙十節各界徵募寒衣運動中，他捐了棉衣五十件，其餘每月各種救國捐，該生亦最爲努力，溢屏小友愛國熱誠，果屬可嘉，而這，亦足以證明人心未死，中國不會亡的象徵；并且說明次一代國民必能負得起復興國家民族的重任。該院院長吳滿眞君鼓勵全體小友起見，特與該生留影，並贈名字曰國屏。新丁</p>
<h3>稿子碰釘記</h3>
<p>— 新丁</p>
<p>自從老家——廣州失陷後，我便開始度着難民生活，在難民堆裏流浪，輾轉流浪了一個多月，偶然的一個機會，使我不自由主地流浪到這南國之島上來。</p>
<p>靠着冷冷之交的友人們的照應，倖而沒有被送進難民營裏，每天好像一點浮萍在水面隨風移動，碰着誰個友人的照拂，便在誰的家裏歇宿一宵，第二天早晨，拖起一雙曾經長征二千五百里的破皮鞋，又　風移動了。</p>
<p>然而，「這究竟不是辦法呀！」，我的朋友開始爲我設想了：「你爲甚麼不寫點文章呢？又不化本錢的。」</p>
<p>「是啊，我怎麼忘記了我的筆呢？」於是我開始嘗試這無本的生意了，爲了我還要活着，活着準備重返祖國効命。我懷着一個小小的願望—文糊口。</p>
<p>花了兩個晚上的時間，在一間被「麻雀」聲　圍的小閣子裏寫成了逃難長征經過的詳情，洋洋萬言，裏面有幾个特寫是一般報紙還不見有發表過的，那是：警察和市民狼狽出走，士敏土廠的爆炸，廣三路上的雖民寫眞，佛山空前盛况，官山壯丁奮勇抗×，西南大火浩刦…我的心裏想，以這樣新穎，翔實，而又動人的節目，加上分段的小標題，就是篇幅小，分日登載也很方便，報紙一定歡迎的，碰巧有朋友說，他有友人和×報相熱，可以代勞送去，于是這篇長文好像列强競爭軍備中的巨艦行下水禮似的輸送出去了。然而這一輸送可不知道送了去大西洋還是太平洋，天天翻×報，總找不到我的「大作」經朋友的朋友輾轉打聽，回答的是，「太長了不便登載」。稿又不退囘。此路旣不通，同時又得本地友　的指點，勸我寫點「軟性」，「趣味』，『短篇』的，自己看了幾天的報紙副刊，果然此語不虛；然而我記起彷彿有那一位「前輩」作家說過，「學寫作」不妨從身邊瑣事寫起」，這句話和上面的幾條件合起來，豈不是頗爲吻合？於是改變「作風』絞腦汁，咬筆頭，抽捲煙，憶起了××還未失陷前黨官，老爺們腐化無能的可笑，便立刻以「輕鬆」，「幽默」的筆調將它描寫出來，作成一篇囘憶文，約摸二千字左右，投去一家大衆都看的，有半頁副刊的報館。隔了一天，居然「入選」了；不過事情有點奇異，刊豋我那篇的不是我所投的副刊，而是某某協會主編的什麼周刊，但他旣然地盤公開，橫堅文章已成了商品，何必固執選擇了主顧？</p>
<p>第二天，在某報上看到了一个新的獨慕劇本出現，閱後頗有　感想，于是又立即寫了一篇劇許，約摸也是二千字吧，仍寄某副刊，隔天又登載了。</p>
<p>啊，邀天之幸，我竟然靠我們文化人特有的筆，能維持自己的生活了，這是　等快樂的事啊！估量自己的禿筆，我除了飯碗所需之外，遝可以買一雙軟底的鞋子，代替我那雙已經作過二千五百里長征的破鞋哩。</p>
<p>想到這裏，我的思索好像勃然開朗，我又記起彷彿某個前輩作家說過，要速成的文壇登龍，便要多寫作，多投各刊物，才易於「成名」於是我底頭　—小小的文章製造廠，加開夜工，提高生產效能，每天都有新的貨色出廠，每天都有交章分頭寄到各報去。可是過了一個星期，敝廠出品紛紛被退囘來了。有的蓋上一個戳子：「請備附有郵票之信封」，有的用紅筆揮上幾個大字：「請惠別種大作」，也有的去如黃鶴，不知影綜。</p>
<p>一盤冷水往屝頂上澆，我默計已刊登那兩篇稿子，已逾月餘，獨自悄悄地走到那報館的經理處，小心地問可有稿酬發給沒有。「有的」，那位經理先生很熱練地打開那本登記薄一查，問明篇名，筆名，在大夾包裏取出了五毫錢放在桌上遞過收據來要我蓋章簽收，我詫異地問：「兩千多字，才給五毫錢嗎？「這五毫是××劇　那篇的稿酬，至於登在某協　的周刊上是沒有稿酬的，」他很自然地回答，同時遞過筆來。</p>
<p>沒奈何，簽了字，蓋了章，接過五隻玲瓏的角子，心理好比做了屈辱的外交官，簽定喪權辱國的賣身契一般的難受。</p>
<p>收得的稿酬和因寫稿的支出如稿紙，郵票、信封，墨水等，對比一下，還虧了比收入多兩倍的「本錢」賣文糊口的希望，終于成了一陣風。</p>
<p>資本主義高度發展的結果，從自由競爭到了　佔。文化人生長右這個社會裏，連做商品的資格也够不上呢</p>
<h3>從理論說起</h3>
<p>— 子由</p>
<p>關于理論與實踐的話，已有許多人說過，但總覺得還有點可以說說·因爲常談理論的人，似乎都忘記了向自己解釋實踐的意義。這眞奇怪。</p>
<p>約瑟夫說：「誰也知道，理論，假如它眞正地是理論，那末就會給實踐者有確定方向的力量，察明前途，對工作有確信，對我們事業的勝利有信仰。」這句話說得很透澈，芷像一面照妖鏡，將一羣冒牌的理論家照出原形來，給眞的理論一件護身　實。</p>
<p>魯迅先生曾經說過：『假如眞識路，自己就早進向他的目標，何至於還在做導師·」雖然他的意思是駡那些自命靑年導師的空頭，當然不是說，做靑年導師的都眞不識路；但我們也可以拿這語來說明那些自命前進，　得理論的空頭革命家之空頭。</p>
<p>眞的，假如他們眞正曉得理論，對他的理論有確信，自己就早已向收的目標，何至閑適地在「世外桃源，避難聖地」（？）的香港，或是比較舒適和安全的大城市，寫文章，談理論，向人家解釋實踐。</p>
<p>當然，我們不是不要理論，因爲『沒有革命的理論，就沒有革命的行動。』理論是行動的南針，同時又要在實踐中充實起來。但我們要的不是只呌別人去實踐的理論，是自己也要實踐的理論。</p>
<p>談「理論與實踐，」而自己沒有實踐的現象很不少，這有它的歷史與社會根源，也不能全怪談理論的人。</p>
<p>由於時代的限制各種政治，經濟，社會，條件之不成熱；所以使許多理論只能談，也只有止於談。人的精力究竟是有限的·自然，由於現時環境之惡劣，許多事情是不會如我們想像中的易於進行。</p>
<p>就拿我們談埋論而不去實踐的朋友來說，由於生活環境之優裕，影嚮到他們的决心之動搖；同時因爲客觀的政治形勢開展還遠遠跟不上軍事的開展和個人主觀認識之充實，所以他們只能痛心地停在『理論』的階段。</p>
<p>可是即使在最惡劣的環壞，也有在最惡劣的環境中的最低限度幹法·要不然，天下無所謂『實踐」，更理論與實踐之聯繫，這個道理了。</p>
<h3>一九三八年文藝評論界</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>對于去年的文藝評論界，我們可以約略地分做下開幾個問題去考察：</p>
<p>一、利用舊形式的問題</p>
<p>二、抗戰文藝一般論</p>
<p>三、文學理論的基本問題</p>
<p>四、魯迅先生的生平，藝術及思想的研究</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>前年八一三滬戰爆發後，侵略者的砲火燃燒　我國文化消宮殿—上海，文藝評論界頗起過一點紊亂：有人說悲哀的文學；有人倡國內階層關係變化太速，作家無法把握現實，作品無法產生論；也有人喊形式貧困與出版困難論：種種色色，文壇浮動。可是以後不久，這一切問題，都被文藝界的生活實踐與創作實踐去給予實際的答復了。</p>
<p>文壇稍爲紮穩陣脚之後，所討論的中心問題，而且到今日仍在熱烈地討論的，雖已有大槪一致的結論，但仍沒有具體的實施方案的中心問題，是文藝大衆化問題——利用舊形式問題。</p>
<p>文藝大衆化問題利，雖然並不就是利用舊形式問題。但今年內我們所討論的文藝大衆化問題之中心，實在就是利用舊形式問題。</p>
<p>關於這個問題，發表意見的人最多。大致以分爲三派：</p>
<p>第一派主張無條件的利用舊形式</p>
<p>第二派主張批判時利用舊形式</p>
<p>第三派是反對利用舊形式</p>
<p>第壹派的主張，認爲中國文化落後，大衆所接近的是舊式文藝，新文藝和他們格格不入。故我們要作抗戰宣傳，只好在無條併地采用舊形式，只要在舊瓶裏裝進新酒—抗戰的內容就是了。</p>
<p>第二派主張舊形式有許多封建要素非常濃　對大衆實在毒害太甚。而且它們根本上就和激烈的抗戰內容相隔太遠，格格不入，無法利用。我們只應該批判地利用那些可以利用的舊形式，至於那些封建毒素太濃厚的舊形式，我們是不應該去利用的。同時，在我們利用舊形式時，實在就是給舊形式注射新鮮的血液，使其起揚棄與進化的作用，逐漸地，使被利用的形式變質，成爲新的東西。我們認爲這種理論是正確的；我們是這一派的主張者。</p>
<p>最後，第三派的理論却認爲五四以後的新文學運動，是文學革命，是對中國舊文學的否定·新文藝掙扎了二十年，才打好勉强站穩的基礎，現在正該是奮勇邁進之時，一旦主張利用中國過去的老形式，不是開倒車，不是給五四新文學運動以否定嗎？這種理論，表面上看去，似乎是非常堂皇冠冕，但骨子裏却是非常荒唐的似是而非的理論。爲什麼呢？因爲這些人是不　得歷史，不曉得歷史的發展的。他們不知道新社會是從舊社會的肚子裏胎育出來的。同樣地，他們是不曉得新的文化，新的文學，是從舊的文化，舊的文學的肚子裏胎育出來的。新　化新文學是舊文化舊文學之歷史的精華的積蓄，否定舊的東西，難道新的是從天掉下來的嗎？只是我們不是盲目的採用，而是批判的利　與援受吧了了此外也曾有若干人提出創造新形式的主張來抵銷利用舊形式的理論，這種理論，深刻的分析起來，也無非是和第三派的，利用舊形色，就是向舊文學投降論」者同一個鼻孔出氣吧了。不多贅。</p>

<p>在抗戰期中、我們體育界流亡四方、體育主管機關（如中華全國　育協會）等的活力也多告停、這固句是一件大不幸事、細窮其因、泰半固由環　、但吾國平素對普遍和平勻發展方面禾加注意、也是毛病之一、現在、除了上海孤島裏有一部份同志稍形活躍外、體育之能保持常態的地方、惟有世外桃源的香港、在這裏因爲流亡者的　聚、人材的源源而來、體育的動態反覺加倍熱鬧、成了全國的重、還好、島上的體育界都是熱血之流、都能認識淸楚本位資任、在不能有大貢獻當中、都能盡其本身的才幹、來做點後方的工作、無論是足球、籃球、網球、小型球、棒球、游冰、國術、田徑、兵乓、種種運動、都一而再再而三的舉行籌賑比　、收入用以購債購　、購寒衣及賑濟傷兵難民、統計由體育界的心血力汗所籌得的欵項、其數也足驚人、就中尤以南華體育會　辦的『全港體育界非常守期工作服役團』爲最得力、歷次舉辦足球籌賑賽、（筆者雖於去秋歐脛、然亦追隨諸同志之後、勉効棉薄、義賽均出戰、未嘗缺席、於深自譴責中、聊足自慰於萬一）書畫義展會、賣物賬災會、水上遊藝籌賑會、田徑羲賽會等等、其工作花樣、層出不窮、各主事人、也努力不懈、予體育圈內外各界以最深刻之佳象、其他如籃球隊游泳團之遠征南洋、雖不能得到意料中的收穫、但對籌　工作方面、也算做過功　、稍盡體育界後方的一點責任、</p>
<p>總而言之、『體育與抗戰』如果大家細心研究一下、實有唇齒株運的密切關係、我們除非自甘暴棄、則無話可說、否則如果我們决心長期抗戰、那就不能不推動體育事業、改進體育機構、增長體育効能、一方面藉以加强全民抗戰力量、一方面循體育的正義、可以掃除吾國還流行着的食污懦席、自私、忌妬、怠惰、怕死等等劣根性、養成健全的體魄、服從的美德、和團結的精神、這三種抗戰必需的條件、又何妨將來最後勝利屬諸我國時、則我國很多地方、在　土後　有一番　新偉大的建、那時我們如果沒有健全的組織、健全的精神和魄力、又何能應付和完成那時復興民族、重整國基的艱苦責任、</p>
<p>最後、我們一面固然希望我國當局之　透視體育對抗戰的重要、與民衆息息相關、由軍事訓練而達到全民體育集體化（辦法和計割有機會再爲文論之）但我們在後方的同胞、同時也應該認淸本位食任、努力從事救國工作之餘、要補助政府之不逮、在重體育的發展、父諭其子、兄曉其弟婛勉其妹、興廢起頹、上下一　、使人人都先有强健的精神魄力、來對付當前的局面、筆者不敏、抱　抗戰必勝建國必成的信念、敢向僑胞大聲疾呼、</p>
<p>『最後勝利、屬終屬於我的』（完）</p>
<h3>法鍊鍛力長</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>一個運動家如欲登峯造極必須具有强大的氣力、技藝尚屬次要、現在我們要討論的是氣的鍛練法、氣就是長力、我們從事劇烈的運動、如缺乏長力、則有構成運動過度等弊害之虞、於是對於健康、不僅無益、反而有害、尤以心肺兩部受害最深、在技藝上所受的影響亦不在健康之下、</p>
<p>長力與循環呼吸兩統有最密切的關係、心肺不僅爲此兩系統的主要器官、爲全身的主要器官、鍛鍊長力必須先强健此兩部器官、心臟或肺臟不健全的人、舉行以鍛鍊長力為主的運動時、須謹愼從事、按步就班由輕而重、切勿操之過急、其實祇要這兩部器官强健、我們的長力總不致過於落後、</p>
<p>此外長力與肌肉也有密切的關係、尤以四肢及臂部爲甚、有許多人雖有强健的心臟和肺臟、是跑上幾步就覺腿部或臂部肌肉疲痛或呈軟弱之狀態、這並非氣有餘而力不足、有許多體力非常强大的人也是如此、他們强大的體力往往如　花　現、這完全是缺乏長力或耐力之故、</p>
<p>心臟或肺臟不健全的人如欲鍛鍊長力、必須多作以鍊鍛軀幹爲主的輕易的柔軟或軟手體　、所謂軀幹卽是胸、腹、腰、背各部、切忌劇烈的運動、</p>
<p>此外最有益於長力的運動尚有奔跑、步行、跳繩、跳　、以及各種呼吸運動、這些運動最　宣於身體健全的人、但是最重要仍是由輕　重、切勿運動過度、身體不甚健全的人欲嘗試這種運動亦無不可、但須更　愼、</p>
<p>奔跑和步行——這種運動不僅有益於長力、並且也有益於腿部的肌肉、最好在淸早舉行、運動時衣服須盡量减少、　勿使身體受寒、精神尤須煥發、不可懈怠或敷衍、否則在行他種運動的時候也會養成這種惡習、</p>
<p>如舉行別的運動時臀部是重要的份子、在練習奔跑和步行之際兩手可各執手　　　一隻、先用力緊握、然後鬆弛、一緊一鬆、至地完全程了止、這樣可以同時鍛練手腕和發達前臂的肌肉、　（上）</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……金鼓雷嗚</p>
<p>Drums</p>
<p>一張英國亞歷山大柯達空前的出品、劇本故事是王子亞辛姆（薩菩）、爲報殺父之仇、及瑪喬麗無意的救了他生命之後、於是就在戈爾親王密謀大舉的時候、亞辛姆不惜去向總督報告這『叛變』的秘密、即更擊鼓爲助、待援軍開到、殲滅叛亂</p>
<p>在演出上有二幕戲很可取、在聖節會塲、宮中止與高彩烈的慶祝、能一面又佈置起事的暗綫、直到鼓聲開始、接着又是一個高潮、援軍開到、雙方混戰、在那設備完善過外國，攝得非常生動自然、是很容易的事、幾個戰爭場面、很庇刺激觀觀衆、外景很可能、更因是五彩、所以顯得非常美麗、</p>
<p>演員方面、『薩菩』在『伏象神童』裏可愛的表演技、這裏仍是很出色、女主角范麗立霍遜是個很美麗而會演戲的英國明星、</p>
<p>皇后　平安……我若爲王</p>
<p>IfI　Were　King</p>
<p>製片家兼導潢佛蘭克勞以前的出品、像「百戰忠魂」、「叛艦喋血記」等、都是銀幕上優秀成功的作品、留給觀衆們一個難以磨滅的良好印象、他這近作「我若爲王」、照批評界的批評、在無論那一方面、較之上舉的幾部、是更進一步的成功的、</p>
<p>故事背景、是法王路易十一時代、外有强敵內有飢民的巴黎、中心人物是一個詩人而兼劍客的流氓、他在暴亂的梨衆中、是一個傑出而居領袖地位的人物、無意中殺了路易的一個敵人、路易因　同時口出大言、便給他全權撑理國政一星期的賞賜、在此期限中他得把强敵趕出國土之外、若不然則將受相當刑罰、憑着他的勇敢與才能、經過絕大的奮鬥與努力、他　戰勝强敵、幷贏得了公主的芳心、</p>
<p>全片演出、偉麗堂皇、各人物也皆活躍有生氣、主要演員中、師路易的BasilRothborn是值得特別讃賞的、導演沒把本片處理得很嚴肅、全片到處那盈溢着幽默諧趣的氣氛、故事本身有着動人的力量、再加上導演的賣力、演技的優秀、劇情的熱鬧、武藝的高超、服裝佈景的典嚴、成功了這一部無可批評的作品、</p>
<p>東方……雙雌爭雄</p>
<p>WomanchasesMan</p>
<p>看了那個片名、就知道是張富有趣味的影片、內容寫一個沒有錢的父親、怎樣用各種巧妙的方法、要向一個有錢的兒子要錢、同時用了一個女子來做帮手、笑話百出、結果他兒子居然　上了那個女子、那末不用說、錢是情情願願的拿出來、投資在父親的公司裏、</p>
<p>主角是佐麥克和同瑪琳霍金絲、演來正是恰到好處</p>
<p>大華……畫室春光She　Marrfed　An　Artist</p>

<h3>美國會昨開幕　考慮經濟報復日德　羅斯福請大量擴軍</h3>
<p>【路透社華盛頓二日電】明日此間召集七十六次國會、將討論若干極重要問題、羅斯福總統之開會詞、將於星期三向國會宣讀、聞內將着重申明、鑒於美國國際關係之轉惡、美國軍事準備應加以强化、詞中並將特別提及總統「西半球防禦」計劃、及門羅主義應加擴大、以促成美洲各共和國之聯合防禦事項、衆料美總統將宣告、今後若干年間、此項重大防禦責任、將主要由美國海空軍祖負、　將要求現有軍備計劃大加擴充、美總統或將說明渠對於獨裁主義向外伸張之觀念、雖不提及簽訂反共協定之三國、然將作如下說明、鑒於日本力圖控制遠東、意大利正向地中海擴張、德國垂涎東歐及烏克蘭、以及三國共同侵入南美市塲、並圖攫取政治利益、美國已無甚別途徑可循、唯有竭其能力、在無碍於國內經濟之範圍內、重整軍備耳、</p>
<p>【路透社華盛頓二日電】頃悉、美政府當局欲將日本佔領中國境內、及德國境內歧視美國貿易事實、提交國會考慮、嗣後採何行動、胥視國會議員以及全國人士作何强烈表示而定、羅總統苟非覺得全國一致贊助其行動、將不運用一九三零年關稅法令第三三八則所規定之總統權力、但聞倘美國人士一致授權辦理、則美行政當局準備採取報復行動、查美國關稅法令第三三八則、規定總統對於歧視美國貿易的國家之輸人品、得實施禁止性的關稅率、並得禁止侵犯國船隻所裝載之任何國貨物輸入美國、倘對方仍繼續歧視美國貿易、則總統可以禁止國民與侵犯國作任何貿易往來、聞數年前對於歐洲某國、美國僅用此項恫嚇、卽足以終止其對於美國貿易之歧視、美國已將此項法令及規定向該關係國大使陳明矣、刻美當局尙未覺卽須實施此項驚人步驟、但據可靠方面探悉、倘美國輿論、對於一再挑衅之國家、日趨激昂、則美當局將不復遲疑、而斷然實施、尤其是在日軍佔領之中國境內、美僑之商業、敎育、慈善等事業、悉被日人系統破壞、實非斷然應付不可云、</p>
<p>【海通社華盛頓三日電】美參議院外交委員會主席畢德門、鑒於日本拒絕美國要求在中國維持「門戶開放」政策、特促請政府嚴禁日本貨物運入美國、畢氏竭力主張採取此項步驟、卽斷絕美日之邦交關係亦所不惜、因日本如向美宣戰、必無利益可得也、畢德門對於此事、雖僅表示其个人之意見、但渠以外交委員會主席之地位稍、現行美國法律授權統總、得下令採取此項步驟云、</p>
<h3>英政府表示立塲　對日態度與美一致　亦將提出強硬照會</h3>
<p>【中央社倫敦三日電】央政府現正考慮、以美政府之先例、對日本發出同樣性質之照會、並聞最近英駐日大使克萊琪、與日外相有田談話時、亦提出美照會內所述之各問題、并表示英政府與美國之立塲、大致相同、</p>
<p>【海通社倫敦三日電】消息靈通界對于美國向日抗議事極爲欣慰、美國在抗議書未曾送交日政府前已將抗議書之內容照會英政府、此足使美國政府能諒解英國在現在無需取同樣之步驟、衆信英政府在日外相有田與英大使克萊琪進行談話時、避免具他舉動、日政府極明瞭英政府之們戶開放問題、對於日本在遠凍計劃之「東亞新秩序」之態度、英政府及政界對此點之意見極爲堅　、完全與美國一致、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦二日電】各報對汪精衛行動消息、並不重視、而對於美國致日本之牒文、則甚爲注意、泰晤上報華盛頓訪員稱、美政府此次照會日政府、係總括以前迭次照會所提出之要求、故為欲對遠東問題作最後之整個解決、又「每日電聞報」華盛頓訪員稱、美國政界人士、漸覺遠東情勢益趨嚴重、美政府必須採取較積極之行動、而不應以不承認日本侵略所得之結果爲滿足</p>

<h3>抗戰一年半後</h3>
<p>— 王紀元</p>
<p>太平洋上的新形勢</p>
<p>（續一月一日本報第二版）三</p>
<p>因爲中國長期抗戰基礎的奠定，因爲我國抗戰實力的增厚，而且，又因爲日本勢力的削弱，在西太平洋上有利益關徠的民主論家（英美法蘇）的政策，起了一個相當重大的雙變。</p>
<p>第一個轉變的表徵，便是列强的首腦們覺悟到「目前國際關係中，前途所依靠的，不單是幸運，也不單是保守，更不依靠宿命，而是採取積極的行動。」（美總統羅期福十二月五日演說。）英首相張伯倫，也感到維持和平現狀的基礎，應有强，的武力爲其後盾。所以，在一九三八年當中，是英，法，美諸民主國家力圖迎頭趕上的擴軍年。</p>
<p>我們只單就太平洋方面而說。這年中，美在太平洋上軍備擴充的積極。打破了歐戰以來的記錄。表面上，美國的海軍，似乎是沉默的，守勢的，如美國海軍大將霍朋竭力聲明：「美國在太平洋方面不會有甚麼戰爭，」而美艦隊總司令李斯却在今年特別發表了一個取消在太平洋上演習的命令。其實，這個沉默，正是其積極的表現。當英國海軍開始把駐華的艦隊大部退至新加坡，又把香港的潛水艇退至中東新落成的海軍根據地的時候，却正是美國擴充太平洋艦隊，海港空軍的開始。羅斯福計劃六年以內建成世界最强大的海軍，於一九四二年以內建成世界最强大的空軍力量。美國爲便利未來在太平洋上的作戰，也進行將夏威夷建爲太平洋上的直布羅陀，并在　地以一千一百萬美元的經費，建立一强大的空軍根據地。美國並已開始計劃佈置從美國令部經墨西哥，直到阿拉斯加的空軍綢，而它的尖端，就是離美國海岸二千四百哩以外的夏威夷羣島，美海軍部同時並已批准在太平洋的中間島，威克島，和關島，各建航空站台，平時可作民用，而戰時則移作軍用。下年度中，美國計劃建造之軍艦，達二十一至三十二艘之多，這種事實都足以証明目前美國止利用中日戰爭，而日本無力與每爭短長的機會，加增其在太平洋上的實力，來維護一切的條約，與遠東門戶開放政策。</p>
<p>本年十一月三日近衛首相公然聲明關閉遠東門戶，修改九國公約以後，美國却給以堅决地維護現行國際條約，遵守門戶開放原則的申明，最近羅斯福德統且有進一步的禁止主要軍需品，以及軍火原料品輸往日本的傅說，而進行年餘的中美借欵，雖然于抗戰一年半後實現了，這不能不說是史汀生時代以來所未有的積極現象。美國對遠東態度的積極，一方面固然是其本身實力的加强，而另一方面，也是基于日本國力的削弱與夫中國抗戰力量的增强。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>第二個表徵是英法兩國對遠東政策的聯合性的加強。</p>
<p>我們知道，自抗戰發生以來，在遠東市場上，受損失最大的要算英國，然而，在張伯倫，西門的實和外交之下，年來英國對遠東的外交，充分顯示　其苦悶徬徨的狀態。尤其是英國在遠東的一些短視的大金融家實業家們，更充分表現着猶　不定的心理。英國希望與日本成立某種協定，希望日本能尊重其在遠東的優越地位，至少在華南的地位，日本應該尊重其神聖不可侵犯性。</p>

<h3>英格蘭銀行行長　諾曼今日赴德　續談猶太難民問題　並傳將會晤希特勒</h3>

<h3>英閣潮和緩　明年不致大選</h3>
<p>【中央社倫敦三日電】英閣潮現已見和緩、反對派五閣員中、有二人向首相張伯倫謂、日前發生發明、并不能代表彼等之意見、而彼等對於各方攻擊國防之事、亦不表同情云、另二人已向首相道歉、故此四閣員當不致辭職、聞張伯倫對於國防計劃頗爲滿意、</p>
<p>【海通社倫敦三日電】英內長賀爾、已開始準備下屆大選、但其日期絕未决定、賀爾請各地方官、將其轄區內之選民名册、擬訂就緒、據若干政界人士意見、英國在一九四〇年前、似不致舉行大選、</p>
<h3>英將建造　中型驅逐艦　針對德國增加潛艇　海軍將校一致贊同</h3>
<p>【美聯社倫敦三日電】每日電聞之海軍專家貝瓦特、今日著論謂、由於德國要求增加潛水艇之結果、英國一切有戰事經驗之海軍將校、皆敦促英國建造若干中型驅逐艦、因此英國今年將定造二十四至三十艘之此項軍艦、渠又指出一切英國現在完成與建造中之驅逐艦、實際上皆爲一千六百九十噸至一千九百二十噸之小型巡洋艦、渠又宣稱、海軍界皆歡迎八百至一千噸五十艘中型驅逐艦計劃、此項新艦、　有合理之高速度、及裝置四英寸及四英寸七分口徑之砲、並附有若干艘魚雷艇及可深至水底三四十英尺爆發之炸彈、渠又、稱英國今日有驅逐艦共七十八　、其中有若干艘已陳舊、而德意日三國所有潛水艇之總數、則達二百六十四艘之多云、</p>
<p>【海通社柏林三日電】德國報界今晨不再保持對於英海軍談話事之絨默、戈林之機關報『國家新聞』稱、『德國並無與英國競爭海軍努力之意、德國建造潛水艇之程序、並未有危險性存在、唯循例申述條約之詞句、故英國實無理由相信英國有遭受德國建造潛水艇之威脅也』、</p>
<h3>英駐意大使　潘斯明年任滿</h3>
<p>【路透社倫敦二日電】英駐意大便潘斯爵士將於明年四月期滿告退。遺缺由前駐土耳其大使羅連爵士繼任。</p>
<h3>末次掀起日政潮　近衛內閣決辭職　繼任首相將為平沼　政民兩黨堅決反對合倂</h3>

<h3>懲汪聲中應注意三點</h3>
<p>汪精衛通×　國，舉國譁然，中央執監常會，已一致决議將汪永遠開除黨籍，並撤除切職務，從此以後，汪精衛不能由藉國民黨　其政治上之地位，實行具招搖煽　的陰謀。我們已於昨日小評中嚴正　出。但汪此次叛國旣是預有計劃的行動，而月是×人亡華計劃中最毒辣的策略的暴露，他們當然不會就此洗手，而還準備最後的掙扎。一切謠言煽惑分化的陰謀，更將層出不窮。所以我們輿論界在此全國一致懲汪聲中、應該特別指出：</p>
<p>第一，截至　在爲止，中央對汪處置，仍依寬大原則，這不是爲了私情，而在給汪一个最後悔悟以謝國人的機會；所以我們絕不應該武斷懲討叛徒的工乍已經完了，相反的，還要全國上下更加警惕戒備，隨時注意並打擊一切分裂妥協投降的活動。</p>
<p>第二，汪此次叛國雖　預有重大陰　謀，但是現在內則遭遇全國人民唾駡，輿論抨擊，政府懲處，外則遭受國際興論議刺與指摘，甚至×人方面亦表失望，其左右親信更顯呈分裂，所以我們要認定現在汪的行動，不過是其個人及少數國民敗類的行動，而决不能看做是代表某一派系的行動。因爲這樣，才能使少數動搖份子幡然覺悟，引汪爲股鑒　各自尊言。即售日身充汪氏部屬的，亦不乏潔身自好愛黨　國之士，今後尤當認淸是非，擁護團結抗戰到底。</p>
<p>第三，×人顯然在利用汪的叛國事件，作爲誇大宣傳的資枓，今天×方的××社已在教發『重慶政變』的謠言，我們千萬不要受欺！要知道，民族敗類經不起時代潮流的洗刷而終被淘汰，這是天演的公例，絕無可以驚奇之處。所以汪的叛國不僅不是國民黨的損失，而且正因國民黨中央的嚴正處置而使其組織更加健全，威信更加增高；同時，不僅不是抗日民族統一戰綫的損失，而且將使各抗日黨派的團結更加堅强。×人挑撥離間的伎倆，適足以證明其「心勞日拙」罷了！</p>

<h3>法意協定廢止及今後的趨向</h3>
<p>法意的外交關係，自一九三六年法國不承認意大利併阿以來，卽失去了常態。此次明興四强協定成立，達拉第爲謀徹底澄淸歐局，以及鞏固法國的國際地位起見，不惜對法西斯蒂國家多方妥協和屈服，於是乘此時機，於十月間重新派遣駐意大使，冀得墨索里尼的諒解。按自意大利征服阿比西尼亞以來，因新使所呈獻的國書中應稱意王爲「阿皇」，此與法國的主張相違背，稽延數年，迄未派遣新大使，就是這個緣故。此次之舉，一般均認爲法國正式承認意大利兼併阿國之先聲。但法國對意大利此種妥協親善的表示，不僅不能使墨索里尼滿意，反而愈提高其無窮的慾望，當法德正在準備共同發表諒解宣言之時，意大利法西斯統治者忽發出對法要求領土的呼聲，這眞出乎達拉第和龐萊的意料之外。</p>
<p>自此之後，法意關係一弛一張，意大利仍無時不在準備着作戰，藉以威脅法國退讓，同時又於一星期前通知駐意法大使龐賽，據稱意政府對於一九三五年一月七日所締結的法意協定，已覺其不切合時勢的需要，而認爲從此不能生効。按法意協定訂立的主要目的：其一乃在保障奧大利和中歐各小國的領土獨立的完整，以防德國的侵略，故該協定中特別載明：「法意兩國政府，爲維持奧大利的獨立與完整的必要，同意决定遇奧國的獨立與完整受他國威脅時，兩國政府得與奧國磋商應付辦法……」；其次則爲解决菲洲殖民地事件。當時意大利對法曾提出幾項要求：最主要者爲（一）突尼斯居民中意人佔大多數，應使其自治，（二）法屬菲洲與意屬利比亞的境界應重新劃綫，改爲與乍德湖接近，意大利亦應享有法屬紅海的吉布蒂港的理權。雙方談判結果，法國卒允許利比亞以南四萬　千方哩及巴貝爾曼特海峽的對面沿岸割讓與意屬伊里特里亞，此外又給與意大利以參加阿京至吉布蒂港的鐵路經營的權利。此爲談判成功的經過及其主要條件。</p>
<p>現在奧大利旣爲德國所吞併，而捷克又入於希特勒的掌握之中，保障中歐已成歷史上的名詞，墨索里尼的野心企圖業已失其憑藉，且鑒於其同夥希特勒屢次所施的恫嚇外交均告成功，德國國勢突飛猛進，遂於羡慕之餘，不得不决心退出其所多年垂涎的中歐，而另圖向他方面發展了，他的黨徒們的大呼：突尼斯，果爾斯和尼斯以及宣佈廢止羅馬協定，其原因就是在此。</p>
<p>墨索里尼宣告廢止法意協定，盖欲仿照希特勒的故智，以求不戰而達到其要求領土的企圖，但這種夢想能否如願以償，頗成疑問，張伯倫和達拉第的外交政策雖力主對極權國家妥協，甚至屈服，但法國不是捷克，達拉第縱不惜對意讓步，然而以法國人民愛國情緒的熱烈，斷無不戰而甘自居於戰敗國割讓領土與他國之理，這也許是意大利不能達到其所企圖的原因之一；再則突尼斯和果爾斯一旦被意大利所佔據，則她可絕對控制地中海，到那時候，不僅法國時時感受威脅，而英國通印度的航路也操縱在意大利的掌握中，張伯倫雖然注重現實，但事實上恐不能再許可他一如明興協定時之所爲，此次訪意，當懍於過去的失敗，諒不敢再慫恿法國退讓吧，這也許就是墨索里尼的企圖不能成功的原因之二。</p>
<p>恫嚇手段旣不能生効，繼之便是採用武力，這原爲法西斯侵略者集團的一貫政策，東方的日本帝國主義如是，德意志如是，意大利亦何獨不然？所以近來法意關係突又由和緩而趨於緊張。據各通訊社所傳，駐東菲的意軍已調集大量軍隊向法屬索馬里蘭進發，且謂佔據該邊境防區六處，此外又向法國提出四條件：（一）突尼斯的意僑卽行大規模獨立，（二）准許意人在突尼斯購買未經墾殖的土地，（三）法將吉布蒂割讓，並將該處鐵路售與意大利，（四）蘇彝士運河得由意方共同管理，同時且鼓動意僑舉行示威運動。</p>
<p>意大利的財政本甚支絀，尤其自對阿用兵之後，更加捉襟見肘，目前開發阿國的資本已感到束手無策，最近且盛傳外相齊亞諾將聘英國，聞其最大目的乃在舉債，以如此貧困的國家，倘欲再從事戰爭，乃爲實力所不許，然希望意大利就此罷手，事實上亦不可能。在這局勢之下，德國一面暗中支持意大利，一面加緊完成其對東南歐的侵略，而意大利則繼續地與法國持着相當緊張而一時不能解决的僵局。總結一句話，英法兩國倘不能與其他的民主國家携手，聯成一條戰綫，成立集體安全制度，依我們的觀察，歐洲的局勢依然無法澄淸，或者會陷於更混亂更緊張的境地，也說不定。</p>
<h3>第一期抗戰的總結與第二期抗戰的前瞻【三】</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>（續一月一日第二版）</p>
<p>（二）淪陷區戰鬥力量的散漫及其與整個戰略失去連系；（三）軍民合作的仍嫌不够，軍隊中的政治工作實際上沒有認眞的全面的發動；（四）民衆動員工作的不切實不普遍，槍棍繩索代替了說服與宣傅；（五）抗屬保護傷病救治與兵役宣傳仍多不够。在政治上，是（一）由於少數人的保守性與自私自利心，黨派磨擦現象緲續存在，抗日民族統一戰綫未够鞏固與擴大；（二）由於政府內一部份保守動搖傾向的尙未肅淸，×人漢奸隨時在圓加以利用，因此對日妥協和反動分裂等危機依然存在；（三）由於封建殘餘勢力繼續阻止玫治的進步，×奸更利用其與親日份子勾結，策動其反對政府反對抗戰以及準備「和平」「獨立」！（四）壓迫救國幽體及愛國靑年，以至捕殺共產黨黨員等事，繼續在各地發生·在社會與經濟上的是、（一）廣大難民的救濟組織訓練工作，未能統一而有計劃地進行，高級官民則在國外盡情揮霍縱慾，而一般中下層難民雖不盡是轉流於溝壑，多亦顛沛於他鄉。（二）對廣大失學靑年雖已盡力救濟，但仍缺乏整個救濟，組織，訓練等更積極的計劃。（三）肅淸貪汚土劣的工作沒有開展，一切政府新政策新法令不能爲農民工人大衆所盡了解，不能忠實擁護；（四）適應抗戰與合理負祖原則的勞工法土地法的缺欠，工人農民及商人的生活沒有相當的改善。最後在國際關係方面，我們政府的外交政策，雖有極明朗的進步，而中心政策仍欠堅定，外交宣傅機構與人事尙欠健全，而國民外交亦幾等與無。至於×方遍佈世界的特務機關與間諜網，我們更連防衛的準備都等於沒有！</p>
<p>由於一切進步的不够，由於一切缺點的未能克服，因此我們直到抗戰第一期的結束，還不能使×我優劣對比形勢起基本的變化，未能停止×之進攻。</p>
<p>目前抗戰的形勢與特點</p>
<p>廣州武漢相繼棄守以後，整個抗戰局勢發生新的變化。但是蔣委員長十月卅日告國民書則明白指出「抗戰軍事勝負之關鍵，不在武漢一地之得失，而在保持我繼續持久之力量」，「戰爭成敗之關鍵，繫於主動被動成份之多寡，我之所以待×者，即爲久戰不屈，使×愈深入，而愈陷於被動，」他明白地指出：武漢棄守爲「我國積極進取轉守爲攻的轉機」和「澈底抗戰轉敗爲勝之樞紐』，也就是說明今後抗戰形勢在基本上是走向「×我對抗」的局面，我們的任務在於爭取一切條件，勝利地轉人抗戰第二階段。又照毛澤東先生在「論持久戰」中的說法：抗戰第一階段，是以運動戰爲主要戰略，抗戰第二階段是以游擊戰爲主要觔略。第一階段是×軍進攻我軍防禦時期，×軍企圖佔領廣州，武漢，蘭州三重要城市，並且把這三個據點聯系起來。但是我們却不能因此認爲必須失去蘭州，並且讓×軍打通了粵漢，平漢，隴海鐵路及西蘭公路之後。才算枕戰第一階段結東，我們不僅應該而且有可能阻止×軍永遠不能把廣州武漢蘭州聯繫起來，也應該而且可能使×軍永遠攻不下西安蘭州，一直到他們被我們驅逐出中國領土爲止。因此，我們可以回答『目前抗戰形勢的特點』這個問題了：</p>
<p>目前的抗戰，還是由抗日持久戰的第一期（或第一階段）轉向第二期（或第二階段）的過渡時期，而且經過我們在廣州及武漢棄守後的各方面的努力，這個過渡時期也要成爲過去，而當此一九三九年新春開始之日，也將被確定爲抗戰第二期（或第二階段）的眞正開始之日。</p>
<p>廣州武漢相繼棄守以後，由於我們的大工商業城市的喪失，主要鐵道的被佔領，國家政權與作戰陣地在地域上均被分割，主要海道的被割斷，以及財政，經濟，交通上的困難，軍火供給的更加不易。這是當時我們所遇的困雞，這種困難還影響到今日以至將來的戰局。而且×人則又開始大規模地計劃成立全國性的俾儡政權，並加緊其挑撥我國內部的陰謀，漢奸親日份子及動搖份子亦加緊其分裂投降妥協等等活動。這種困難和×奸的陰謀，直到一九三八年底，還是存在而且發展着。十月十四日起開會的中共擴大的六中全會，早曾在其决議案中指出在這一時期，『抗戰營壘中可能產生意見分歧，甚至某些份子的動搖與局部叛變』。這些都是目前及今後抗戰中的嚴重問題。但同時我國的團結與進步，從廣州武漢棄守以後，也達到了飛躍的程度。我們最高領袖與全國人民反對妥協抗戰到底的決心更加堅定了！國共合作及統一戰綫更加發展了，國民黨共產黨黨員數量的發展與政治影響，也更加擴大了！我們保衛武漢的大軍迅速轉移完竣，我們在湘贛湘粵桂邊迅速佈成新的陣綫，我們在鄂西和陝豫一帶完成了偉大的防禦工事，我們是這樣的在各路前綫阻止着而且將阻止了×人的繼續進攻。同時我們在×人的後方，已級更廣泛地晨開游擊戰爭，抗日根鍊地也不斷在發展中。我們廣大的完整的後方，西部各省，則正熱烈進行堅持抗戰和準備建國的一切建設！我們政治上經濟上文化上民衆動員上一切缺點正在飛躍的進步之中，日漸服克過來；而一時逆轉的國際形勢，亦因我們團結與抗戰的堅决，由十二月英美兩國對華信用貸欵的成立開始，國際同情與援助我國制裁日本侵略者的運動，正在廣泛地發展着了！相反的，日本侵略者雖然表面上似乎取得勝利，但實際上因爲戰綫延長，日益痛感兵力的不足與分散，而今後遠離海岸，鐵路與大河的山地戰，更將給×人以重大困難。同時×人的後方，則因游擊隊的廣泛發展，日益陷於到處受羣忙於應付，消耗疲憊的境地。此外我們還應該注意×人國內經濟財政的危機，人民反戰的高潮，和×人進犯華南所引起的日英日法日美關係的惡化。在我們堅强的長期團結抗戰前面，日本侵略者只能找到他們自陷總崩潰的道路！</p>
<p>那麼，我們現在已經具備了發動轉敗爲勝的戰鬥的可能嗎？我的囘答是有這可能了—總結上面的叙述，歸納成下列幾點，便是我們現已具備的轉入「×我對抗」局面的有利條件與基礙：（一）抗戰一年半以來，我們不僅達到了以空間換時間的目的，而且在這些「空間』上，使×人付了重大的代價，特別是在過去三期抗戰的苦戰惡鬥中，消耗×人時間十六個月，兵員卅餘萬，軍艦數百艘，軍費數十萬萬；我們却仍保持二百萬以上的大軍，並在戰鬥中學會了新的戰略戰術，增加政治經濟社會各方面的進步。（二）蔣委畏說：『我中部及東南之人力物力多已移植於西部諸省，西部之開發與交通建設已達初步基礎』，並且完成了新的國防工事和開創了許多新的軍事工業，編練了許多新的兵團，（三）蔣委長說：「我在武漢外園鄂；豫，皖，贛主要之地區，遠及×人後方之冀，魯，遼，熱，綏，察及蘇浙各幹綫，均已擬就持久作戰之計劃，配置適宜之根據與兵力，一切部署悉已完成」，而且還有（四）國際援助力量的擴大，和（五）×人困難的坩重！</p>
<h3>（三）第二期抗戰的形勢與前途</h3>
<p>×我形勢的對比</p>
<p>我們首先應該指出，在這第二期抗戰開始的時候，我們的×人所遭遇的困難，遠在我們所遭遇的以上，而且是不可解决的。第一，從軍事上看，目前華北五省分佈×軍約十一个師團，兵力在三十萬以上，但是不論西渡黃河或回犯晉察冀邊區，不能抽調超過四萬的兵力。加以華中，江南，華南所需要的兵力，現已兩倍於華北，而各區間則仍留有巨大面積的空隙，爲我國政府法令所及。並且不問×人今後向西向西南或向西北進攻，一切地形交通條件，都不能發揮其特具的長處，而倍加困　；反之，我們只要一面逐步繼續保持與加强正面防禦部隊的戰鬥力，完全採用新戰略，運用大規模的野戰兵團，止×軍的進攻；一面在戰區×後，派遣大規模的挺進兵團，與原有游擊部隊協同一致、發展廣大的游擊戰、從後方抓住×軍；同時在後方加緊建立新的近代化的軍隊，積極新生反攻勢力，最後勝利是可以保證的—第二，從政治上看，×人現已深入腹地，但並不能達到統治中國的妄想。現在華北五省三分之二以上的城市，仍在我們軍隊和人民手裏，許多漢奸維持會之類迭被摧毀，而僞軍的反正，工農小商人等的協助游擊隊，這種情形，已經逐漸蔓延到華中江南知華南。我們只要對淪陷區戰鬥更加注意，擴大游擊，爭取僞軍，爭取民衆，建立，保持及擴展淪陷區的抗日政權，配台着我們軍事上的發展，最後勝利更可保證。第三，從經濟上看，×人强佔粵漢兩市，原想完全恢復長江沿海區域的商務，解救國內財政經濟的恐慌，卽從中國吸收金錢原料，支持侵略戰爭。但以僞滿爲例，卽可知無補其目前急需；且我在華北已有晉察冀邊區的抗日政權的存在，游擊非常發展，使×人這種計劃不能實現，華中江南各大城市所有工廠礦山鐵路，非被炸毀，卽已遷移西部諸省。卽有剩餘，亦不能作爲×軍事生產的依靠。商業貿易情形也是一樣。我們只要更普遍地發展游擊戰，特別是使華南和江南的游擊戰，能配合正規軍作戰，則×人的計劃便可全部失敗，我們冉能堅决實行戰時財政經濟政策，廣泛發展西部生產建設，加增農業及發展內地交通運輸，則我之富源長期取用不竭，而×人則將不免中途崩潰。第四，從國內情况看，×方國小人少，資財不富，戰事愈發展下去，兵力愈感不足與分散，經濟困難日益嚴重，軍事生產已無後縫，台鮮滿蒙各軍中反戰情緒日益激昂，可証×人不堪支持長期抗戰。我們則屬相反，即以目西南西北諸省而論，有廣前大的地區與人口，一切建設正在飛躍進展中；縱在淪陷地區，我們亦有不可抗的勢力存在，成爲將來反攻時期的一大勝利因素。最後從國際形勢看：×人爲發展在華勢力，勢非排除歐美勢力不可，但因此也勢非在國外多樹仇×不可；反之我們在粵漢兩市陷落後能堅持團結抗戰到底，英美列强援華制日運動已有新的發展！</p>
<p>×我今日的準備</p>
<p>×人由於本身及國外種種困難的嚴重，决定了他們政策的永遠是速戰速决。今年新年，日本內閣又將改組了，但這個方針將永不變更—根據這個方針。他一面固然不得不竭澤而漁，實施全部總動員法，準備較長期的戰爭，但這是萬不得已的，他們今日主要目的是獲得一個暫時的『和平』—因此他們今後的戰略，固然仍在計劃向西南西北進攻：第一步是攻下西安蘭州，再進而連接廣州漢口蘭州各點，一方面鞏衛了廣大的佔領區，加强統治，準備更大的戰爭，一面逼我偏促於西部山谷，不能發展，進而將我主力『聚而殲之』。但×人自己對此夢想也不敢說有何把握，他們攻下武漢以來兩个多月中，固然在積極整理兵力，重新　置，準備更大戰略的進攻；但同時却着重在政略的進攻，一方面在佔領區實行虛僞的『懷柔』政策，收買民心，希望把日本人民今復再也負担不起的戰爭盒担壓在我淪陷區同胞身上；另方面又特別强調『反共』及『進攻西北』口號，强調『議和』的誘騙，以便策動親日澳奸誘感動搖份子進行分化中國團結的應動。這種運動在一九三八年年底幾乎已經廣泛地展開。我們呢，自從粵漢兩市失陷後，蔣委員長首先發告國民書及致電參政會二次大會。昭示中國堅持團結抗戰到底。接着是中國共產黨擴大的六中全會宜言告全國將士民衆各黨派書也發表了，誠懇提出國共兩黨及抗日黨派員進一步合作辦法。並確定長期合作共建三民主義共和國的政策。惜而軍事首要陳誠白崇禧朱德諸將軍，先後發表堅持團結抗戰，實行持久戰全面戰主動戰及加緊軍隊政治工作等重要講話，不僅指出待久抗戰必勝的前途，而且指出了我們已有具體的辦法。同時這兩月以來，我們在軍事政治經濟外交文化各方面，都已開始飛躍的淮展，如戰區的重新劃分，指揮權的統一，淪陷區戰鬥力的調整與加强，軍民合作條例的公佈，若千省市政治機構的改善，辱職殃民大員如鄧悌等的嚴屬慾辦，民衆動員工作的强化，國民參政會二次大會的新的成就，省市參議會的限期成立，英美信用貸欵的成功，西部建設計劃的實施，西北國防工業的經始，和重大國防工事與新軍的陸續完成，都是比較顯著的，此外如淸除政府內少數民族敗類與兩面份子，加緊掃蕩漢好×探運動，堅强抗日黨派親密團結等，尤爲打擊日本侵略者今日戰略與政略的必要的對策。</p>
<p>二期抗戰的前途</p>
<p>蔣委員長在十二月廿六日總理紀念週的訓詞中，會　我們特別指出：『我們的抗戰，已進入一个新的階段我最近屢次指出，過去十八个月，可名爲第一期的抗戰，就是抗戰的前期，從今以後，乃是第二期的抗戰，亦就是抗戰的後期。我們現在無論南北各戰塲上，前方的士氣和戰鬥精神的旺盛，爲自開戰以來所未曾有的實好氣鴃。一般官兵，都明知這一次中日戰爭。在×人是要整個的滅亡中國；在我們是要　從根本上救起中國；所以意志都異常强固，精神更是十分積極。而一般國民，也都能認識×人非貫澈他侵略的毒謀不止，非滅亡了中國不罷手，我們非從死裏求生，就無倖存之理；所以環境儘是痛苦，而各地軍民的意志，愈趨堅定，祗要前方後方認識國家的危機，萬衆一心，向着最後勝利的目標，刻苦努力，犧牲麥鬥，不懈怠。不屆服，深信必能達到抗戰的目的。』而十月間中共六中全會决議案亦明白指稱：『中共擴大的六中全會堅决相信，具有五千年文化，擁有四萬萬五千萬人口的偉大的中華民族，在民族團結，國共長期合作的條件下，在日本人民反戰反法西斯運動的　合條件下，在全世界愛護和平的民族國家所有先進人類的同情與援助條件下，進行反對日×的勝利的民族自衛戰爭，驅逐日×出中國，建立獨立自由幸福光明的三民主義的新中國，光明的前途已見曙光，最後勝利是一定屬於中華民族的！』</p>
<p>是一九三九年了！大家檢閱一下自己的武器吧！嚴肅起來！緊張起來！只有熱烈堅决參加這次鬥爭；才有我們的自由，才有我們的勝利！光明的前途已見曙光！前進！我們一定要自由！我們一定要勝利！</p>

<p>航空方面，本部亦隨戰局之發展　加原有航綫班次，極力於×人破壞民營航運之情　上，維持通航，並添購飛機，以應需要，抗戰以前原有航綫總里程，計長一五〇〇五公里，戰事發生後，各地航綫，　戰局變遷，漢口未失陷以前，漢港綫原改夜間飛行，以策安全，最近中國航空公司新闢航綫，共長三千三百，里里歐亞航空公，司新闢航綫共長六千三百公餘餘其他亦計劃中之航綫約有四千四百餘公里。</p>
<p>（四）電政</p>
<p>戰時電訊，關係戰事甚爲重大。本部特組織戰時電訊委員會統籌一切，以應機宜，同時並與各省所設長途電話線密切聯絡，以利長距離之通訊。計在抗戰期中，本部增加各線四四八〇、五公里，現正在設立者尙有三五八三公里。是以在此抗戰一餘中，　政方面所用之銅線，可等於以充，計已裝設無線電台八處，正在籌沒尙未完成者十四處，話幾已裝設完成者三處，正在裝設者一處，至國際無綫電台，則早經完成，可與歐美各大都有直接通報，甚爲陽利。</p>
<p>電信之搶修工程，與鐵路性質相似，關係軍事通訊至爲重要。抗戰發生之初，平漢沿鐵路電綫，卽遭×機轟炸、爲搶修迅捷便利軍訊計、即於　定石家莊等處、編組修綫工程隊兩　，　備卡車及自行車，就近隨時搶修。至八一三滬戰開始，復於東戰塲如南翔眞如昆山蘇州等處，加組修綫工　隊，旋以戰綫愈廣，工程隊亦隨之增多，總計截至現在止，分佈於各地者總共約五十等隊。</p>
<p>（五）郵政</p>
<p>郵政方面爲適應作戰部隊通訊之需要起見，抗戰　　，卽辦理軍郵其，設範置團，常隨陣地而轉移，第一期抗</p>
<p>戰軍郵區域，僅限於晉冀魯滬蘇浙諸郵區之內繼而漸及陝豫皖贛鄂各區。二十七年八月底經軍郵會議充實組織，整理規章，益加嚴密，現鄂南，湘北，粵東沿海一帶，均已發生戰事，軍郵範圍，因之擴大，目下共設陝晉豫西鄂皖湘鄂贛皖浙江粵東蘇北等八個總視察段，每一總段內，設若干分段，以便管理。</p>

<h3>湘桂車中座談會　「上」</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>在一個細雨濛濛，寒氣襲人的薄著，從桂林市風馳電馳般地乘了一小段汽車，便得轉達抗戰後始積極修成的湘桂鐵路特快車北上。</p>
<p>此行有兩個原因，使我非常高興！一個是：近日粵漢路北段戰事，由沉寂轉變成我之反攻，看捷　，說不定我到長沙汨羅一帶的時候，便是我英勇將士收復岳陽或附近據點的住期。當然囉！我們應當聞勝勿驕，因騙兵必敗；可是聞　而不喜，不樂者，似乎此人也大有漢奸嫌疑。所以，有人（連我在內）聽得北段反攻勝利，以及廣州外圈連克名城，便眉飛色舞，津津樂道不衰，我認爲這是情理中事，未可加以　非。另一個原因：自淞滬移師以後，我個人未與長跨兩省以上的國有鐵路謀面，亘亘一年有除，如今重睹湘桂鐵路新建的××車站，寬大的站台，修長的鐵軌，一端已通湘省和粵漢路啣接，一端却向國際間芷加速伸展出去。鐵軌×道上，停滿了新舊各色各樣的車輛，且各列機車，都已升火待發，準備繼續爲抗戰運輸盡其最大功能。車站壁間，還大書特書有「×寇一日不滅，我們永久不得安寧」；「變×人的後方爲我們的前方」；「忍受個人暫時痛苦，爭取民族永久自由」等標語。這些新興，偉大，有力的景象，看了眞叫人有一種說不出的歡喜和希望！</p>
<p>雖然有些人在另一觀點上，不免有點酸辛感觸，就是停留在軌道上的那些車輛，從車皮字跡上，認識它們不是湘桂本路的車，而是京滬，滬杭甬，浙贛，津浦，隴海，膠濟，平漢，京奉（即北寧舊車）等路的車，因爲這些車輛所駛行的鐵路本身，不幸被×人佔領的佔領，截斷的截斷，所以它們（車輛）才逃難似的薈萃到這一路來。從這方面一想，自然會令你浮起一幅「國家半殘破，人民多流離；暴×長驅入，流血無已時』的悲慘印象，接着再往下想去，甚至會令你滴下幾點酸辛淚！</p>
<p>不過，假若你能透視問題的那一面，當然就能別有會心，使你破涕爲笑！理由很淺顯，在抗戰以前，這些車輛，所謂物各有主，是不可毫無畛域地亂跑的。甚且有些地方，還故意將鐵軌造窄，以便與他路車輛，斷絕往來。可是自抗戰以後，一切政治軍事經濟和交通，都實行了有形無形的大團結，實行了聯合統一戰線。各路車輛，不得互越雷池的怪象，也才一掃而光，可以從戰事重心，向各路自由進退。軍委會副委員長馮玉祥先生到西南各地，一個人敢在馬路上來囘巡閱，某戰區司令長官陳誠先生，也不拘形跡的在桂林山中測驗老百姓對抗戰的認識，他如政治部副部長周恩來先生，八路眾總參謀長集劍英先生，新四軍軍長葉挺先生等等，都很隨便的在各地任意出人公私讌會場所，記者和朋友們每一次無意間碰見他們，無不異口同聲，讀爲這是反映一致團結抗戰，內部絕無問題的好現象。以人事例物質，各路軍輛，得向新路自由進退，誰能說不是個好現象？而况，我們這次的抗戰，是焦土抗戰，并引用堅壁淸野的原理，對于淪陷區所有的公私物質，事先携出，當然應力求其盡。響如武漢作有計劃的撤退時，就是一輛人力車，也得令車夫早拖到沙市宜昌一帶去；帶不走的東西，微如馬路上蓋陰溝的鐵板，也要將它沉到江底去。總之，不將任何有用物件，留以資×。我們能對失陷區各路車輛，有計劃的安全撤退到後方來駛用，這不僅含有堅壁淸野的意義，而且還準備將來反攻時，也好駕輕就熟，叫它們分頭裝運英勇將士，向各原路打回老家去呢！</p>
<p>——那天在湘桂路××車站上，一部份乘客，觸景生情，對着那些大團結的車輛發嘆的聽了這一席話，大槪不會再作無謂的納悶了吧？</p>
<p>入夜，到了開車時間，汽笛一聲，我們所乘的特快車——「隴海』綠色鋼皮車，連機車一共十二節，好像一條綠鱗游龍，便搖頭擺尾地軋軋北上。</p>
<p>『隴海』綠色鋼皮車的嶄新，安穩和設備，堪與抗戰以前京滬路藍色鋼皮車互相媲美。而今遠在湘桂路上，『借用高材』，居然也得舒適乘坐，這又令旅客們平添了一番興奮。雖然現在駛行的是一條誕生不久，前途無量的新築路，因路基尙未十分穩固，特快車不好認眞開得特快：雖然近因此段戰局轉佳，湘省逃到桂林來的難民，現復整裝北返，以致坐位特別菲擠；可是一般乘客們，都安之若素，後來車行逾時兩三倍以上，并不曾聽得那個吐出半句怨言。</p>
<p>這次隔日一開的特快車（當然還有其他普通快及貨車），三等座固然特別擁擠，二等座也照樣無法揷足。記者買的是二等票，畢竟因擁擠關係，不得其門而入，承查票人通融，得移坐頭等膳車，倒也嘸啥。膳車僅備中餐：早餐一律吃『連湯飯」，每盤收洋二角；中晚兩餐，則有炒鷄蛋、妙白菜、燉猪肉、燉牛肉、蘿蔔　五樣菜，每朵一律收洋三角，外加白飯每客二角，儘你吃飽。這樣『五菜一湯飯』的吃法，好像會經什麼部審定過的：天天如此，從不更換。但乘客們不是飲食之徒，當然也甘之若飴。假若自己的荷包有限，還有叫你再吃檢省一點，那你可以買平民化的零食吃：湯麵、稀飯、墟餅、饅頭等，各站都有得叫賣的。五香鷄蛋和五香豆腐干，也有人叫賣，而且是江浙人叫賣，不過吃起來有點變味，據說是買不齊香料，他如舊日津浦平漢兩路各姑所賣的燒鷄。兩角洋即可買到一隻肥美的燒鷄，這里却沒有；大家想吃的話，只好積極準備收復失地再說。</p>
<p>車行轆轆，長夜漫漫，隨便和左右乘客們攀談幾句，大家就成了『相見恨晚』的朋友。有一位姓段的武裝同志，他是某地軍校的防空敎官，他說：『今後因戰局轉移關係，西南各重要都市的防空，因高射砲等用具之集中，自然就要日見其强化了。比方，×機幾次到桂林轟炸，僅在高空作水平式投彈，而不敢在低空作俯衝式投彈，就是怕悞觸我高射砲火網，請他下來陸地一遊桂林山水！』</p>
<p>段君爲答某客之問，他又說：『意大利眞不够朋友，她起初甘言蜜語，說不要我們的庚子賠欵了；但是要將這筆欵項解去，向她購飛機，結果，使我們上了他的一點當。猶幸我們的飛機來源，購自意大利的，僅佔最少的一部份，所以上當也上得極小。』</p>
<p>另一位操江西口音的朋友揷嘴說：『意大利人豈僅不够朋友了論他們的不法行爲，已早與日本法西軍閥如出，一轍，換句話說，他們確實是日軍閥臭味相投的黨羽。在我內地的意籍傳敎士，頗多替×方當任間諜工作者。老河口意籍神甫。已公開承認替日軍供給情報·漢口將撤退時，某敎堂意籍神甫，收容男女難民二千餘人，男子八百人旋被逐出，僅留婦女一千二百餘人，她們滿以爲可以托庇無恙了；可是幸得該敎堂的一位華籍神甫，仗義向外告密，說那個意籍神甫，準備等日軍到漢時，要將道一千二百餘避難婦女，玩套『揖盜入鬥』的把獻，全數獻給日軍，以作盟友觀見犒勞之禮。政治部第三廳工作人員聽得風聲，才趕快設法，將這批幾乎被意籍神甫拿去膏虎吻的女同胞搶救　來。</p>
<p>『他們（指意籍神甫）終究做賊心虛！』那位操江西口昔的朋友推開車憲，先吹進來一股冷風，使大家打了一個寒噤，他向外吐了口痰，復順手關起車窻，接着又說：『江西萍鄉，最近有個意籍傳敎士到鄉下去傳敎，他用流利的中國話，向一羣團繞着他，好像看要把戲似的鄉童問說：『你們是那里人？』那羣兒童大聲答說：『我們全是中國人！』他再問：『你們中國同誰打仗？』羣兒仍異口同聲地答：『同日本×子打仗！』那個敎士笑了笑，似乎還有再問的話；可是有個兒童已撿先問他：『洋人先生，你又是那一國的人呢？』敎士漫不經心地答應：『我是意大利人。』他不說意大利人還罷，一說意大利人，那羣兒童便有些異樣了，有的握緊小拳，有的鼓起小嘴說：『哦！看不出你還是意大利人，你們意大利帮助日本×子打我們，我們不耐煩再聽你的×話了，我們要打倒你！』同時敎士的頭上，便有來歷不明的石片，飛來和他行碰頭禮，嚇得他趕快拔步跑回敎堂，睡到半夜暗想：這些鄉童還懂得這個，大人當然更加厲害了！他越想越覺可怕，似乎當地人立刻就要來請他眞的去見上帝一樣的可怕！輾轉不能入夢，結果硬逼得他翻身起來，深夜去請地方當局保護，第二天一早就把他護送出境……』　〔未完〕</p>

<p>Changsha—Changde, October 16th: I got up at around 5 o'clock this morning. The noise from the street was incessant. I pushed open the window and saw student soldiers gathering, doing exercises and taking walks, a lively scene. Soon, I asked the tea attendant to move the luggage downstairs. I took a rickshaw to the main dock. I saw many colleagues who had already boarded the boat. The boat was small and crowded, and many people were sitting on the roof of the boat. After a while, the center of gravity was lost. This morning the wind and waves were very strong, the boat tilted, now to the left, now to the right, a very dangerous situation. When the boat reached the center of the river, the waves surged, almost submerging us. I was terrified. After the boat sailed to Shuizhen Island, we all went ashore and took a second ferry. At this time, although the wind and waves were strong, the boat was much more stable than before. After arriving ashore, we went ashore. The cars had gathered, a total of three, carrying a total of fifty-four people. After waiting for about an hour, we added enough gasoline and started driving. This was almost my first time taking a long-distance public bus. The seats inside the car were narrow, and the glass windows vibrated violently while driving. The speed was about forty kilometers per hour. Due to the air absorption effect, dust and ash came out of the furnace, covering our clothes. We all covered our mouths with handkerchiefs. Fortunately, I was sitting in the front of the car, and the vibration was not very severe. If I were sitting in the back of the car, the pain would be unbearable.</p>
<p>Both sides of the road were lined with trees, and the road was very flat, a deep red color. Looking down from the carriage, it was very spectacular. Sometimes the road cut through mountains, sometimes high, sometimes low, like a long snake. There were still many villages along the way, not very desolate. The car traveled for a long time, and we were very tired. After the car passed Wangcheng Slope, the mountain road became more and more dangerous, rising and falling. At some points, it seemed like we would fall off. Before long, the car arrived at Bai Ruoshi, connecting Ertong Ershi Bo, directly reaching Liudu. After passing Sishi Bridge, we arrived at Jiang Bridge. The bridge was magnificently constructed. The car stopped briefly when it reached Duoxiang.</p>
<p>From Changsha to Ningxiang, it is forty-four kilometers. From Ningxiang to Bai Ruo, it is eleven kilometers. From Ningxiang to Yiyang, it is sixty-five kilometers. From Ningxiang to Changde, it is a total of one hundred and forty kilometers. After passing Long Bridge, the road along the way was exceptionally desolate. Although there were newly built Xiangyi Inns on both sides of the road, they were all dilapidated. Only the Xinyi Middle School building was relatively neat. After the car passed Yiyang, it arrived at the riverbank. The passengers all got off the car and unloaded the boat to cross the river. The car then drove into a large ship. After arriving on the other side, we got back on the car and passed Cuijia Bridge, Taiqian Temple, Dashi Bridge, and arrived at Sandianshui, where we had to cross the river again. We had crossed the river several times from Changsha to this point, getting on and off the car, which was quite troublesome. The inconvenience of inland transportation can be seen here. However, sitting in the car for a long time was like being in prison, making us dizzy. Being able to get out and rest was beneficial to our mind and body. From Dashi Bridge to Changde, it was only ten kilometers away. When we arrived, it was already 2:30 in the afternoon. We found the Min'an Inn at Changde Station, which charged only six jiao per person, including lodging and two meals, which was very cheap and beautiful. After a short rest, we took a civilian boat across the river into the city. The area was not very large, and business was not prosperous. All the shops were located along Zhongshan Road. There were many silk shops, but few restaurants. We first entered from Lin Yuan Gate, passed through Zhongshan Street, Nüwa Street, Nanshan, Xiaonanshan Street. The stone roads were paved with stone and were quite clean. The women in the city all wore black clothes. It was not very elegant to see young girls dressed like this, and it did not express the lively spirit of young women. This habit should be improved. At that time, the sky was already slightly dark. We called a boat to cross the river, costing one jiao. According to the boatman, bandits often appeared near Changde, and guests who encountered them often met with unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, he advised us to cross the river as soon as possible. He also said that Wuling was still ninety li away from here. As he spoke, a bright moon appeared in the sky. Looking at the green hills in the river from afar, it was hazy. The waves and moonlight reflected each other, which was very eye-catching. By the time we returned to the dormitory, it was already about 7 o'clock.</p>
<p>Changde—Yuanling, October 17th: The car departed from Changde Station at 8 o'clock this morning. The scenery was very good. At about 7:45, we arrived at Taoyuan. Beside it was a cave, and in front of it was a stream, accessible by boats. My colleagues all got out of the car to rest. After a while, the car and people crossed the river together. After arriving at the riverbank, we had to get back in the car. At 9:10, we arrived at Zhengjia Post Station. The scenery from Taoyuan to here was the most beautiful and clear. At 9:40, we arrived at Cha'an. This place is 265 kilometers away from Changsha. After passing Taipingpu, Huangtujin, and Sandushui Station, we arrived at Qingshan Gang at about 11 o'clock. The road was dangerous and steep. Sometimes we went up the mountain, sometimes we went down the mountain. At the end, we found new life in a desperate situation, like a long snake winding through the mountains. The number of turns was the most I had ever seen in my life. I was dizzy and nauseous. Fortunately, I brought Bagua Pills and Mentholatum to treat it. Then I used my hand to tighten my head, which relieved it a little. For those who travel long distances, it is true that you cannot go a day without this thing. As for masks, towels, chair cushions (it is best to hide something soft in the middle, because the car is very fast and vibrates a lot. Without this thing, your butt will suffer), after crossing several mountains, we arrived at Nan'an Temple and Taofanpu. The last four kilometers made people extremely tired. My head was dizzy, and the dangerous places were something I had never experienced in my life. The cars were all driving on cliffs, sometimes thousands of feet high. The peaks stood angrily, and looking down made my heart pound. The difficulty of traveling was unparalleled. Even thinking about it now makes my heart pound. After Yuanling Station, we checked into a hotel. The hotel was cleaner than Changde. After a short rest, we crossed the river to Yuan City. The city was not very big. We first entered from Zhongnan Gate. Along the streets, there were many yams and fresh mushrooms for sale. Eating them carelessly could easily lead to poisoning. The streets were paved with stone, just like Changde. There were no docks along the river. We encountered many Miao people, dressed in strange clothes. Both men and women in the villages wrapped their heads in cloth, just like Indians.</p>

The domestic vessels on the above three major shipping routes have been cut off and are completely occupied by foreign vessels. The inland ports that were previously prohibited to foreign vessels are now exclusively navigated by foreign vessels. Only a few domestic vessels are still operating on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and various inland ports.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Paris Wax Museum</h3>
<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>I remember when I was a teenager, I read a very moving article in a textbook, which was "A Record of Observations at the Paris Oil Painting Exhibition" by Xue Fucheng. It described an oil painting of the Franco-Prussian War in the Paris Wax Museum, depicting the miserable situation of France's defeat at that time, with the intention of arousing the people's patriotic and vengeful emotions. That was the general idea; I have forgotten the detailed content. Although I was very young at that time and could not fully appreciate the purpose of this article, the term "Paris Wax Museum" left a deep impression on me. This time, when I arrived in Paris, I asked my friends how to get there. My friends said, "Are you influenced by Xue Fucheng's article?" I said, "Exactly." It turns out that eight or nine out of ten Chinese people in Paris go there because of this article. An article has left people with an impression that has produced an incredible magic. It can be seen how deep the influence of words is.</p>
<p>The wax museum is located at 10 Boulevard Montmartre. This area is a hub of entertainment venues in Paris, somewhat like the Fei Lu Road in Shanghai. The wax museum occupies a small corner of it. The wax museum is called Musée Grévin in French, in memory of its founder, Grévin. After entering the museum, I bought an entrance ticket for eight francs. The light inside was dim. The first thing that caught my eye was a film company's shooting scene. The director was directing the filming. One of the characters on stage was relatively familiar, it was Krétai Gaza. The second room contained contemporary French celebrities, such as Launbre, Dalady, etc. Other famous aviation figures and sports masters from various countries also occupied separate rooms. The fifth room was a shocking depiction of the Spanish war. Government troops were resisting in a church. Two people were holding rifles, one person was setting up a machine gun, and two other people were already lying on the ground, dying. There were also two large clocks hanging in the church. The scene was realistic, and the expressions were lifelike, making people think of the cruelty of the Spanish Civil War. After seeing them, I thought of my own country and couldn't help but feel endless emotions.</p>
<p>The important figures on the world political stage selected by the wax museum included only the contemporary dictators Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin. Other figures such as US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Chamberlain were not selected. Perhaps the wax museum believes that only these three giants dominate the current world. Stalin was smoking a pipe, Mussolini was raising his hand, and Hitler was tightening his belt, each with a different expression. Recently, an Italian tourist went to Mussolini's statue and, because he hated him to the extreme, committed suicide with a gun at the foot of the statue. It can be seen how much stimulation the wax museum gives to people.</p>
<p>Because the British Emperor was coming soon, the wax museum also added new statues of the British Emperor and Empress. This can be regarded as a timely embellishment. In addition, downstairs there are interior scenes of fashion stores and performances by famous actors. However, what is more worth seeing is a pair of hands of the great writer Hugo. These hands are carved from white stone, with a handwritten letter from Hugo to Grévin and a quill pen that he used during his lifetime attached to the side. The basement is mostly about revolutionary stories, full of prisons, killings, and court scenes. The fire is flickering, which is eerie and terrifying. This is probably what is called the "Reign of Terror"! The famous Madame Roland is also on trial. Madame Roland has a famous saying, which is: "Liberty, liberty, how many crimes are committed in thy name." She is of course also a victim.</p>
<p>There is also a realistic depiction of the place where the French tyrant Louis XVI was imprisoned. There is also an original copy of the confession of guilt issued by Louis XVI on December 25, 1792, posted on the side. He was killed on January 20, 1793. There is a picture (not a wax statue) depicting the scene at the guillotine very clearly. The body is separated from the head, and blood is splattered everywhere. This is the end of a generation of tyrants. There are many other wax statues depicting French history. There is also a place that explains the important events in Jesus' life, divided into five rooms. Because there was not much time, I did not have time to look at them one by one.</p>
<p>In addition to wax figures, it also retains many important documents and historical materials. I saw a notice signed by General Calleni, saying, "The government is now moving west. I am ordered to defend Paris and will certainly obey the order and swear to never change. I hereby announce this." A few words fully express the scene of panic in Paris that day. The date of the notice is September 3, which I think was in 1914. Another notice, issued after the German army occupied Liège, says, "After our army arrived here, we have shot 110 bad people. If anyone else does not obey our army's orders, they will be shot without mercy." The wording is arrogant, and it is not difficult to imagine the ferocity of the German army at that time and the mood of the French people to resist. There is also a place where war trophies seized from Germany during the Great War are displayed, including the lead remains of a Zeppelin. During the Great War, the German Zeppelin airship dropped many bombs over Paris. This is the most unforgettable thing for the people of Paris to this day.</p>
<p>I walked around the hall for a while and saw a woman sitting on the corner of a long chair (which is for tourists to sit on), and an old man sitting and reading a newspaper. I didn't pay much attention to them. Later, after walking around in a circle, they were still sitting there. I was very tired from walking, so I also sat down next to them, intending to chat with the old man reading the newspaper. But when I looked closely, it turned out that he was also a wax figure. Looking at the woman again, she was also not a real person. This is a novel thing that cannot be seen in the London Wax Museum, because I would suspect that there are wax figures on the tourist seats as well. I looked around carefully again and suddenly found a soldier sitting upstairs on the railing, smiling and looking down, and a caretaker who was sleeping soundly, all wax figures. So, it is necessary to be very careful to distinguish between truth and falsehood.</p>
<p>While I was watching with fascination, the bell suddenly rang loudly, indicating that the magic show and the Crystal Palace attached to the wax museum were about to begin. Everyone swarmed upstairs and first entered a small theater, where a magician performed several magic tricks. After each magic trick was completed, he told the audience all the contents. Finally, he advised customers to buy his book so that they could practice themselves. It seems a little out of scope for the wax museum to have a magic show. Moreover, what is performed is also very ordinary. After about fifteen minutes, the magic show was over, followed by the Crystal Palace. Tourists arrived in a room with glass on all sides, decorated with various lights, sometimes red, sometimes green, sometimes many, sometimes few. So, when people are in the room, they see thousands of lights reflected in the glass. A burst of darkness mixed with the rumbling of thunder, indicating that it was raining. There were also displays of snowfall, various different situations, all using lights to show them. Although there is not much meaning, it is indeed quite interesting for children to come and see. They can also think of the application of optics, which is of considerable benefit to enlightening children's wisdom. The magic room and the Crystal Palace are open about every two hours. This can be regarded as an extra article of the wax museum. The oil painting of the Franco-Prussian War mentioned by Xue Fucheng has long been replaced. The things it displays are often changed. The battle of the Great Wall, which was displayed last year, is no longer there. In the twilight, I left the Paris Wax Museum, which left a deep impression on me, and stepped back onto the bustling Montmartre Street.</p>

<h3>Occupation of China's Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Since Japan restricted the export of cotton products to China in order to retain its ability to obtain export foreign exchange (because it had integrated the monetary system of North China with the Japanese yen, Japan no longer receives export foreign exchange for exports to "North China." This means that Japan, which desperately needs foreign exchange, has no choice but to restrict exports to China in order to export to a second country, or to restrict its domestic textile production by restricting exports, thereby restricting the import of its weaving raw materials in order to save its import foreign exchange. For increasing foreign exchange, the paths are different, but the goals are the same), the textile markets of the Northeast, "North China," "Central China," and "South China" have experienced a surge in prices. For example, 20-count yarn in the Northeast has reached 490, and Tianjin and Shanghai are also approaching 300 yuan. However, the highest price in Japan is only 221 yuan. Therefore, Japanese textile capitalists all believe that investing in factories in China is profitable. With the support of the military, Japanese businesses have recently been very active in the textile industry in China. According to a survey by the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shimpo in early November, Japanese yarn spindles in various Chinese territories are arranged as follows. Of the yarn factories in Qingdao, most of the equipment was destroyed before the occupation. All of the above equipment has been installed this year and is scheduled to start operating in the spring of next year. Among them, the Guoguang Factory, formerly the "Huaxin Yarn Factory" run by Chinese businessmen, was reorganized by Nagasaki Guoguang Textile Co., Ltd. after being acquired for 2 million yuan. The Qingdao Toyota Yarn Factory was also among those destroyed. In addition to restoring some of the equipment, it also acquired a Chinese yarn factory in Binan (factory name unknown). In addition, there are countless Chinese yarn factories now run by Japanese yarn factories. According to the Japanese International Economic Weekly, Vol. 19, No. 5, the following Chinese yarn factories on the outskirts of Shanghai are now said to be "jointly operated with Japanese businesses."</p>
<p>Operated by Toyota</p>
<p>Operated by Shanghai Textile</p>
<p>Operated by Yufeng Textile</p>
<p>Operated by Zhongyuan Textile</p>
<p>Operated by Zhongwai Textile</p>
<p>Recent Statistics on Yarn Spindles in Japanese Yarn Factories in China (Number Existing on November 1 of this Year)</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Toyo Keizai Shimpo in early November, the Renfeng Yarn Factory in Jinan, the Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang, the Jinsheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Taiyuan, and the Yufeng Heji Yarn Waste in Zhangde are now all operated by Zhongyuan. The equipment of each factory before the war is as follows:</p>

<h3>Chinese Representatives Luo Xuhuo and Others Agree to Assist in Deferring Delivery of Goods. The Import Goods Merchants Association was Informed Yesterday that They Would Exert Efforts on Their Behalf and Will Conduct Amicable Consultations with the Chairman of the Western Merchants Association.</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Import Goods Merchants Association for piece goods, foreign goods, copper, iron, etc., in order to request Western merchants to defer the delivery deadline, after the second meeting the other day, wrote to Chinese representatives Luo Xuhuo and others for assistance. Yesterday, they received a reply from Representative Luo and others, agreeing to provide assistance. The original texts of the two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter: To whom it may concern, since Guangzhou was forcibly occupied by [omitted text], land and water transportation have been completely cut off. The members of our merchants association and others have ordered goods from various European countries from various foreign firms, the sales of which depend entirely on Guangzhou, accounting for a considerable amount. Although there are normally warehouse and silver periods, the contract deadline is easy to pass, but the resumption of transportation is uncertain. Our merchants association and others feel deeply about this difficulty and, on the first day of this month, jointly wrote to the Western Merchants Association requesting a deferral of the delivery date and exemption from warehouse rental interest. Subsequently, the association replied on December 16, stating: "Our association expresses great sympathy for the difficulties encountered by your members and other merchants due to the Japanese army occupying Guangzhou and other parts of South China and blockading the Pearl River waterway. However, the recent request you have made has been carefully considered by our association, and our members still believe it is difficult to implement. We are writing to inform you to inform your members to pay and collect goods on schedule, etc." As the end of the year is approaching and financial conditions are tight, the impact on our association and others is relatively light, while the impact on other businesses is significant. If the Western Merchants Association's reply, as stated, requires payment and collection of goods on schedule and is unwilling to be flexible, the financial situation in Hong Kong will inevitably become more serious. We have always admired your representatives' concern for overseas Chinese affairs and understanding of merchants' difficulties. We are now jointly requesting your esteemed assistance to help us overcome this difficult period. Our merchants association and others will be extremely grateful, and the commercial interests of Hong Kong rely on it. How to proceed is anxiously awaited. Respectfully addressed to Hong Kong Chinese Representatives Luo Xuhuo, Zhou Junnian, Luo Wenjin, and Li Shufen; Guo Quan of the Puyi Merchants Association; Huang Liangshu of the Piece Goods Guild; Chen Jingtao of the Electrical Appliance Merchants Association; and Zhou Huaiyong of the Iron and Steel Merchants Association.</p>
<p>Reply: Respectfully replying, we have received your letter regarding the request of your association and others to the Western Merchants Association to defer the delivery date and exempt warehouse rental interest, requesting assistance. We are honored by your trust and will certainly exert our efforts. However, this matter is a mutually agreed procedure for trade between both parties and cannot be interfered with by government power. Currently, our representatives intend to conduct an amicable consultation with the chairman of the Western Merchants Association to observe the effects. We respectfully inform you in advance for your reference. Luo Xuhuo, Luo Wenjin, Zhou Junnian, Li Shufen.</p>
<h3>The Great International Sympathy— French Respond to Our Debt Repayment Movement! Citizens Should Actively Participate!</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Frenchman named Mr. Bo visited the General Chamber of Commerce and donated two Hong Kong dollars in response to our country's recently launched one-dollar debt repayment movement. According to him, the Chinese people's launch of this one-dollar debt repayment movement shows the determination to support the government's war of resistance to the end and demonstrates China's ability to repay debts, renewing international perception. China is fighting for international justice and humanity, and for world peace, which is of great significance. Not only should China strive to support it, but peace-loving people around the world should also provide just support. My ability is limited, and this small donation only expresses a bit of sympathy.</p>
<h3>A Warrior Wounded by a Gun in the Fengtou Chung Refugee Camp Died Yesterday. The One Stabbed is Still in a Dangerous Period.</h3>
<p>In the Matou Chung Refugee Camp in the peninsula, there are currently a thousand of our country's warriors stationed. The other day, two warriors were shot by Indian soldiers, one wounded by a gun and one wounded by a bayonet. Both were sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. Details were first seen in yesterday's newspaper. However, by about one o'clock yesterday morning, the warrior who was shot died due to severe injuries. Although the doctors tried their best to rescue him, they could not bring him back to life and he passed away. The injured warrior also suffered serious battle wounds and has not yet passed the danger period, but compared to the previous day, he has improved slightly. According to yesterday afternoon's De Chen Western Newspaper news, the deceased was named Ma Xiong, 40 years old, a soldier of the [omitted text] division [omitted text] brigade. According to the Indian army guarding the camp, the deceased left the camp privately that day and walked to the guard post, saying that he wanted to go out for a while. The guard soldier warned him not to. However, the deceased did not listen to him (perhaps due to language barriers), refused to return to the camp, and went past the guard post. The Indian soldier then fired a shot, hitting a vital point. The deceased was injured outside the camp. The Indian soldier then helped him back to the camp and reported to his superiors. After the incident, the soldiers in the camp rioted, but after explanation, there was no further incident.</p>

If he wants to be released on bail, he must post bail of HK$35,000.</p>
<h3>British Court Issues Medals, Four People in Hong Kong Receive Awards, Three Britons and One Chinese Employee.</h3>
<p>The British government awards medals every New Year's Day to those who have contributed to the United Kingdom, regardless of whether they are British officials, civilians, or people of the colony. Yesterday, on New Year's Day, the British court issued awards as usual. A total of four people in Hong Kong received awards: (1) Henderson, Director of Public Works of the Hong Kong Government, received the O.B.E. Medal; (2) Mr. Qi, Manager of the Hong Kong Western Merchants Association, received the same medal as above; (3) Tilla, the current Chief Inspector of the Hong Kong Sanitation Bureau, received the M.B.E. Medal; (4) Song Dingwen received the I.S.M. Medal. It is reported that Mr. Song has worked in various agencies of the Hong Kong government for more than 20 years and recently retired due to old age. Before retirement, he was the Chief Clerk of the Hong Kong Medical Department.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Instructs Chinese Merchants to Strictly Prohibit [omitted text] Goods. Those Who Purchase and Transport [omitted text] Goods Will Be Sentenced to Imprisonment or Fined. Impersonating [omitted text] Goods Will Be Sentenced to Death.</h3>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce here received an official document forwarded by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, attached with one copy each of the Regulations on Prohibiting [omitted text] Goods and the Regulations on Prohibiting the Transportation of Materials to [omitted text]. According to the main points of the Regulations on Prohibiting [omitted text] Goods, those who order [omitted text] goods and transport and sell [omitted text] goods will be sentenced to imprisonment of one to seven years and fined up to 5,000 yuan. According to the main points of the Regulations on Prohibiting the Transportation of Materials to [omitted text], those who provide materials to [omitted text] will be fined 1,000 yuan. Those who impersonate [omitted text] goods as national goods, and those who violate this regulation will be sentenced to death. It is also found that Hong Kong is the only market for the transportation and sale of [omitted text] goods in South China, and various piece goods account for the majority. Before the outbreak of the war, the total value of piece goods imported into Hong Kong was more than 10 million yuan per year, and [omitted text] goods accounted for half of it. After the July 7th Incident, although the members and employees of the Piece Goods Guild unanimously implemented the selection of goods movement, there were still many non-member members who secretly searched for and operated, so the effect was not as planned. It is also learned that in recent months, [omitted text] country's piece goods that have been transported to Hong Kong after changing the trademark have greatly increased again, such as Western wool, women's wool, thread velvet, ceremonial velvet, autumn velvet, and cool velvet. The estimated total value of winter goods alone is as high as 3 million to 4 million yuan. In addition to asking members in the east, the Piece Goods Guild cannot prohibit those who operate privately.</p>
<h3>The Journalists Association Issued a Declaration Yesterday, Supporting the Central Government's Resistance to the End, Opposing Wang's and All Pro-Peace Fallacies, and Requesting the Central Government to Eliminate Wavering Elements as Much as Possible.</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association, because Wang Jingwei contradicted the development of the war of resistance in our country and issued a gaudy telegram, with absurd wording, which easily misled the world, specially held the third joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday, unanimously passed a resolution to support the central government's war of resistance to the end, oppose Wang Jingwei's pro-peace proposal, and decided to issue a declaration and condemn its absurdity. Details were seen in yesterday's newspaper. The declaration has been drafted and reads:</p>
<p>When the July 7th Incident occurred in Lugou Bridge, the central authorities solemnly declared and pointed out that</p>
<p>Once the War of Resistance has been launched, there is no reason to compromise midway. If we compromise midway, it will lead to destruction. This statement and this intention have been firmly and enduringly held by officials and people, both high and low. The reason is that [omitted text] people have a consistent policy towards our country's intrigue. If we firmly resist and wage a protracted war, we will not be able to eradicate their conspiracy. In the past ten months of the War of Resistance, our situation has gradually progressed to a certain stage. Recently, the [omitted text] army suffered heavy casualties, reorganized and replenished, and was unable to invade. The international atmosphere has also undergone a clear change, expressing unusual goodwill towards us. Therefore, if we can continue to persevere, we will surely make [omitted text] people yield. If at this time, we spread rumors of peace talks and generate the wrong idea of compromise, it will be enough to shake the foundation of the country and act as a tool for [omitted text]. We must strongly refute it and not allow it to spread and confuse public opinion. Recently, the [omitted text] magnate Konoe Fumimaro, due to his difficult situation, spread</p>
<p>a Smoke Screen of Peace. Considering his true intention, it is not only absurd and outrageous, but also insidious and cunning. Our central leaders have severely condemned it one by one, exposing his conspiracy and cunning to the fullest. Therefore, the so-called Konoe statement is merely a more poisonous and spicy trick used by [omitted text] people to invade us, in addition to military force. All Chinese patriots should deeply hate and detest it and see through his treachery. However, former Central Vice President Wang Jingwei suddenly left his post at this time, hid in a foreign land, and issued a proposal, responding to [omitted text] and speaking for [omitted text]. We believe that Wang's move is a reversal of history, shaking the foundation of the country. No matter how he conceives and phrases it, there is no truth in it. Moreover, Wang was also an important member of the party and the country in the past, and his words and deeds are most likely to be misunderstood. Now he suddenly has this</p>
<p>Betrayal of Public Opinion, An advocacy of undermining the war of resistance, which is not only sufficient to destroy his personal past history, but also sufficient to put the country in a state of eternal doom. We believe that Wang's so-called proposal is, in fact, an attempt to open the door to peace in East Asia, rather than to seek surrender to [omitted text] and to shake the entire advantage of the war of resistance and kneel before [omitted text] people. Moreover, the absurd statement of the [omitted text] cabinet has been severely criticized by Chairman Chiang one by one, and the true intention has been exposed. Even a three-foot-tall child can see through his treachery, so there is no need for Wang's advice. Since Wang is an important member of the Central Committee, he cannot be said to be unaware. However, he deliberately embellishes</p>
<p>Reversing Black and White, Sima Zhao's Heart. It is difficult to discuss where to go and what to do. Yesterday, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees discussed and determined that "Wang's actions are a clear violation of discipline and harm to the party and the country. In the face of justice, we cannot tolerate it. We declare that we will immediately and permanently expel him from the party and remove him from all his duties." We believe that this move by the Central Committee is decisive. All nationals must absolutely support it. At the same time, we believe that Wang's betrayal of the party and the country and his reversal of history is the most unfortunate situation in the course of the war of resistance. However, from [one/another?] perspective, it actually makes our war of resistance situation clearer. Therefore, from now on, our country's war of resistance will inevitably be more confident than before. At this time, we must be of one heart and one mind and support the Central Committee's</p>
<p>Policy of Resistance to the End, in order to achieve the final victory. Apart from this, we must severely attack any rumors of peace talks and any wrong ideas of compromise, so as not to spread them. At the same time, we deeply oppose Wang's pro-peace [argument], and we must also deeply oppose any so-called pro-peace fallacies of anyone. We believe that in this dangerous situation in our country, there is only one way to survive, that is, to resist to the end and persevere to the end. We support the central authorities'主張, and we will never compromise midway. As this resolute war of resistance takes on an increasingly明期形狀, we respectfully hope that the central authorities will take this opportunity to further renew [military?] structure, rectify discipline, and eliminate all corrupt elements and cowardly soldiers who are enough to shake the war of resistance, so as to thank the people of the country and calm public opinion, and to make the war of resistance front more嚴整, and [ensure that] after the final victory, we can achieve our goal. This is our sincere hope. This declaration.</p>

<h3>May the Blood of the Dead Wash Away the Stains of Politics.</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>A Record of the Memorial Service for Ye Duanren. Hong Kong Social Organizations Will Appeal to the Guangdong Authorities to Rectify Discipline.</p>
<p>Wreaths, elegiac couplets, simply and plainly exuding an atmosphere of grief and solemnity. Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, hosted by the Chinese Arts Advancement Association, the cultural circles and social organizations of Hong Kong mourned the death of Mr. Ye Duanren with great sorrow.</p>
<p>Originally, Ye Duanren was a standing director of the association. He had served in the Hong Kong news industry for many years and was a very progressive young writer. Several months ago, he led a Hong Kong Xijiang Seven County Association service [back to our] country delegation to Xijiang area to engage in national salvation work and made great efforts. Recently, at the invitation of the Yunfu County People's Self-Defense Corps Discipline Council, he served as the corps' political instructor. In mid-last month, while on official business from Yun[fu] to Xinxing, during the [omitted text] machine's wanton bombing, local illegal soldiers took the opportunity to loot Mr. Ye's property and killed him to silence him, and he died.</p>
<p>The Chinese [Arts Advancement] Association, Xijiang Seven County Association, Printing Workers Union, Nanyang Overseas Chinese Save-Our-Hometown Association, Huining Association, and fellow members of the China Bookstore, as well as Mr. Du Qi, Zhang [omitted text] and others, all sent sorrowful and tragic elegiac couplets. Like the [couple] of the Association fellow members:</p>
<p>"The nation has reached the final juncture, gathering overseas talents, requesting [to enlist and] returning to the country to lead the vanguard. Who would have thought that the heavenly duty would not be completed and the name buried in the mountains, and not be obliterated; the war is only a transitional phase, awakening the masses in the country, raising their sleeves to resist [omitted text], who would be willing to fall behind. Take advantage of this increasingly tempered public sentiment, and wipe out [omitted text] in blood in Guangzhou."</p>
<p>The elegiac couplets of the third branch of the Printing Workers Union and all the staff of the China Bookstore are also the most sincere expressions:</p>
<p>"Not dying under the guns of the [omitted text] people but dying at the hands of the Han traitors, when will the martyrs close their eyes?</p>
<p>Striving for the survival of the motherland, sacrificing for the liberation of the nation, loyalty and righteousness penetrate the clouds."</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's portrait was hung below the national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. He looked very young, clean, and kind. The national flag, highlighted by the black and white elegiac couplets and the simple wreaths, was even more鲜亮.</p>
<p>During the ceremony of silent mourning, the mourners all recalled with heartache that this was an epitome of a difficult era, and at the same time, they paid their highest respects to the more soldiers and fellow countrymen who died in the disaster.</p>
<p>Du Qizhang, chairman of the Arts Association, offered wreaths and asked questions. This eulogy also early touched people's hearts:</p>
<p>On January 3rd, the 28th year of the Republic of China, all members of the Hong Kong Chinese Arts Advancement Association respectfully offer 生花 elegiac couplets to Comrade Ye Jun Duanren's [spirit]:</p>
<p>For the survival of the nation and the people, you have been constantly拼命;</p>
<p>For the great cause of cultural construction, you have been constantly呼号!</p>
<p>Your one mouth, overthrown many shameless [omitted text] people.</p>
<p>Your one pair of strong legs, kicked away many卑污clowns.</p>
<p>Your one sharp pen,刺国 countless decadent败类.</p>
<p>Ah! You, you are a warrior of the nation, a pioneer of the cultural world!</p>
<p>Humanity, the nation, is in need of you, is looking forward to you, is looking forward to your efforts——success!</p>
<p>How could it be that that虐弹, which is hated by the entire Chinese nation, pierced through your chest and ended your great cause?</p>
<p>Now,烽火遍华南, just when you and us are about to step forward together, who knew that we would be weakened by you, this warrior!</p>
<p>We understand, now our chances of dying are many, you just happened to be the one who碰了 chance.</p>
<p>We understand, although you are dead, your spirit is eternal, your great cause has not stopped because of your death.</p>
<p>We swear before your spirit, we are willing to advance along your blood stains! To avenge you! Also for the struggle for the liberation of the entire nation!</p>
<p>Victory is getting closer and closer to us, please 含笑安 [rest]吧!</p>
<p>Soul, come back, discuss the rivers and mountains of the motherland!尚飨!</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Fan'an reported Mr. Ye's history with an atmosphere of grief and indignation. First, he narrated Mr. Ye's efforts to engage in cultural work in Hong Kong and the process of returning to the country to serve and [dying]難. At the end, he put forward Mr. Ye's advantages to encourage the dead to imitate: one is to be興世无权利之争, but to fight for truth and justice; second is to be enthusiastic about learning, society is the school; at the time of death, he was still holding a book.</p>
<p>Those who spoke were Huang Chuqing, Feng Jinchi, and Yu Suo'ya, representatives of the Chinese Arts Association; Mr. Lin Guangfu, a representative of the Printing Industry Union, and many representatives from other social organizations. The representative of the Huining Association spoke with tears streaming down his face. The atmosphere of the venue became even more凄楚.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Fu's speech also aroused people's resonance very passionately. He said: (1) Death is originally a very ordinary thing; bloodshed and sacrifice are also the price that must be paid to win victory. However, now that the war of resistance has reached its most serious and tense moment, when the country most needs him to work, he should not have died. (2) Mr. Ye is usually very 绒默, in fact, some people笑 his courage is not enough. However, he has now bravely returned to the country to participate in the war of resistance, and even more bravely sacrificed for participating in the war of resistance. We friends who stay in Hong Kong feel ashamed and悲痛. (3) It has been a year and a half since the war of resistance, but the political institutions have not been improved, and political education is still 万分不够, which has an extremely great impact on the entire future of the war of resistance. Mr. Ye did not die under the guns of the [omitted text] people, but died寃 at the hands of his own illegal soldiers. Although Mr. Ye's personal misfortune makes us十分同惰 with lament, the reason for the 寃 death - the lurking of the political crisis in the wartime rear - is a serious problem that we must never ignore and that urgently needs to be improved with the greatest strength.</p>
<p>After the speech, it was followed by悲憤地,热烈地 discussion. As a result, in addition to resolving to organize a memorial committee to engage in condolence to the family and collect literary works, it was also decided to unite Hong Kong groups and appeal to the new chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government to severely punish the murderers, [and] 卹恤 the families of the dead. And it is necessary to actively rectify the network of discipline and protect the定全 of overseas Chinese returning to the country to serve.</p>
<p>Spent three or four hours participating in this solemn,悲憤的 memorial service. On the way back, I silently wished that the blood of Mr. Ye would wash away the stains of politics. - A glimpse of the city</p>
<h3>Huizhou Growing from the Ashes of War: A Travelogue of Returning to Huizhou, Part Four</h3>
<p>I. A Glimpse of the City</p>
<p>[Special Travel Correspondent for This Newspaper] Huizhou is now under the radiance of the Blue Sky White Sun flag.</p>
<p>The recovery of Huizhou, according to various investigations, occurred as follows: During the days of the Japanese withdrawal, the small number of compliant residents in the city were prohibited from entering or leaving. On December 7th, residents near Dongxin Bridge were ordered to relocate to Zhongshan Park, fearing they would be subjected to torture, slaughter, or burning. They were concentrated and imprisoned in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, terrified and pale, looking at each other. Afterward, several loud explosions shook the earth, revealing the destruction of Dongxin, Jinxiu, Weitong, and other bridges. That night, the Japanese quietly withdrew, taking several Italian and German missionaries with them and burning three to five vehicles for their own use. Self-defense teams from villages such as Fucheng and Huangdong, upon learning of the Japanese withdrawal, entered the city led by team leaders Huang Shulan and Huang Zhisan. However, before the self-defense teams arrived, the city's criminals also learned of the news, colluding with local bandits to enter the city and plunder extensively. As a result, the section of Shuidong Road near Guangdu Hall in the county town and the section near Tongrentang in the prefectural city, businesses that had not been burned by the Japanese, were set ablaze by the bandits. Many valuables that had survived the Japanese looting were taken by the bandits. These two major catastrophes turned Huizhou into a field of ashes. When the self-defense teams saw the sky-illuminating fire in the city, they rushed to encircle and attack, and the bandits fled in panic. The East River Guerrilla Headquarters and the 453rd Brigade also arrived in pursuit, taking full responsibility for local security. The enemy's retreat was quite secretive. If it had been discovered earlier, most of their "Imperial Army" would have been annihilated on the East River. According to the Guerrilla Headquarters' report, they were still ambushed by our guerrillas in Luofu Mountain and Futian, resulting in significant casualties. Huizhou amidst the flames has gained a partial redemption.</p>
<p>The desolate scene in Huizhou is heartbreaking for anyone who isn't emotionally numb. Over five hundred shops lined the winding Shuidong Road in the county town, but more than four hundred of them have been destroyed by fire. Broken iron gates, crumbling high doors, and charred beams are all the same, making it impossible to distinguish the names of the businesses. Standing among the rubble for a moment, one can smell a strong stench. Many emaciated dead cats and dogs, as well as the carcasses of pigs and chickens killed by the Japanese, litter the streets, mixed with moldy clothes from the shops, creating an unbearable odor. Several decaying human corpses remained in places like Huangtang Bridge and Gangbutou in the suburbs, submerged in water, and were only recently buried.</p>
<p>The fire-stricken area within the city is extensive. Shuidong Road, Xianyu Street, and Tangxia in the county town, along with Wanshi Road, Shizi Street, and part of Jindai Street in the prefectural city, totaling six hundred buildings, account for forty percent of the city's households and are the most commercially prosperous and luxurious areas. Alas, this is a special gift from the Japanese.</p>
<p>Public buildings, although not burned, are mostly in ruins. The Japanese seem to have an innate bestiality, and they love to turn the places we consider most solemn into their dirtiest haunts. The Zhongshan Memorial Hall in Huizhou Park, for example, was their stable. How can we wash away this shame? Even more painful is the Dongxin Bridge spanning the East River, which was over five or six hundred feet long and completed less than half a year ago. It made a heroic sacrifice along with the nation's misfortune, collapsing under the Japanese explosions. Now, the massive fragments lie overturned in the green waves, its majestic yet ruined form leaving people with sorrow and anger.</p>
<p>II. The Establishment of New Huizhou</p>
<p>Grieved by the nation's devastation and the loss of their homes, many citizens returning to their hometowns have a renewed will and determination. They are resolved to resist the Japanese and build a new world from the ashes. Tianyuan, Huibo, and many other teahouses and shops have reopened for business. Others, without complete storefronts, are conducting business by setting up tables and chairs on the streets. Many small vendors from the villages are also present. Shizi Street is unusually bustling from dawn to dusk every day, but prices are high, and supplies are scarce. The Post-War Relief Committee, jointly established by various party, government, and military sectors, has also emerged, with specialized committees for pacification, relief, sanitation, and other matters.</p>
<p>Naturally, after a major catastrophe, the environment is different from that of peacetime. During peacetime, various tasks had existing institutional foundations to follow, and private wealth could be utilized to facilitate implementation. However, after the catastrophe, the people are exhausted, and their wealth is depleted. Moreover, many old systems have been destroyed. In this chaotic and depleted state, effective and enlightened officials and dedicated local individuals must work together; otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve results. The future of the Post-War Relief Committee will be determined by this.</p>
<p>Disorder is almost a universal phenomenon in post-war areas. From a military perspective, the city of Huizhou currently houses self-defense teams, guerrilla forces, volunteer armies, and regular troops from the ××× Division and ××× Brigade, totaling several thousand people. Armed civilians wearing plain clothes, carrying short guns, and wearing armbands can be seen everywhere. Recently, they have been dispatched to various districts. The disorganization of the troops has significantly impacted local security. At the very least, it allows bandits to impersonate military personnel and seize opportunities to commit crimes. Therefore, the unification and reorganization of the guerrilla forces are essential to strengthening their power. On the 27th, when this reporter met with Luo Fengxiang, the guerrilla commander of the × District, Commander Luo also expressed insightful theories and concrete measures, which will be detailed in a later report.</p>
<p>After continuous arson, both the residents in the occupied city and the newly returned citizens are qualified to be called disaster victims. Although they have shattered homes, they lack clothing and food. Families of several people huddle at dilapidated doorways, creating a new picture of refugees. Fortunately, the government and local authorities are conducting relief work, and a provincial comfort delegation arrived a few days ago. Three porridge distribution centers have been set up at Zhongshan Park, County No. 1 Middle School, and Liudu Temple, each serving two to three thousand people daily. Watching them carry their worn-out bamboo baskets, the elderly supported by the young, the strong carrying the children, walking step by step on the rubble without a sound, with tears streaming down their faces, forming a long line, one cannot help but feel a pang of heartache. However, the children of the Chinese nation grow up in hardship. We cannot sigh, we cannot weep, we can only use our own blood and strength to create a new world, a new Huizhou.</p>
<p>Huizhou, 27th</p>

<h3>Go to the Occupied Areas!</h3>
<p>— Longxi</p>
<p>Currently, in many occupied areas, the Japanese are working to eliminate Chinese culture. The steps are to first eliminate Chinese history, then all Chinese books, and finally eradicate the Chinese language. The means are vicious, needless to say, but the main question now is how to crush the Japanese conspiracy. Some advocate using "guerrilla-style written propaganda" to ensure that "the people remain even if the land is lost." I believe this is a passive method, at best only preventing the people in the occupied areas from becoming Japanese slaves temporarily. The active method, however, is how to prevent the Japanese from occupying the land, or at least, preventing them from benefiting from it, even preventing them from resting peacefully. What is this method? It is to strengthen the resistance capabilities of the occupied areas.</p>
<p>We have seen that after our repeated expressions of resistance to the end, never ceasing the war, the enemy has also made similar statements about a "long-term war." I dare say they have already implemented it. How? Simply put, it is to use Chinese manpower and resources to support the Japanese military invasion of China, which is what the Japanese call "using Chinese to control Chinese." The most concrete and ruthless means are nothing more than levying taxes and conscripting soldiers on the spot, and developing resources. In this way, the Japanese can sit high up, watching the Chinese nation commit suicide with guns and knives. For the Japanese, this is very pleasant, but for us who are suffering, we only need to think about the sight of puppet troops being driven to the front line to feel a chill down our spines. Moreover, today we can see puppet troops in the Northeast, and who knows if puppet troops will not appear in Suwan Xin in the future? Since the Japanese have already started conscripting soldiers and levying taxes in these areas, naturally there is no reason not to use them. When the enemy uses large numbers of puppet troops and a large amount of Chinese resources to fight a war of attrition with us, our long-term resistance will naturally be affected by such ruthless means.</p>
<p>However, the main reason why the situation is like this is that there are few people in the occupied areas who can confront the Japanese; otherwise, they would never let the Japanese do whatever they want. As far as I know, when the provinces of Hebei and Shandong were occupied, many passionate young people stayed there. Later, most of these people mobilized many people who were unwilling to be slaves and formed a formidable guerrilla force. In Shanxi, due to the efforts afterward, there were even better results. In the past two months alone, the Japanese military casualties in Shanxi alone have been no less than 20,000, and good news is also frequently reported from various parts of Hebei and Shandong. In short, in the lost lands, the provinces where the anti-Japanese work is done diligently are the places where the Japanese feel the most pain: on the one hand, they must use strong forces to suppress them, on the other hand, they continue to suffer significant losses, and dreams of levying taxes, conscripting soldiers, and developing resources are impossible to realize.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the importance of guerrilla work. I hereby hope that young people with ambition, when they have no opportunities to study or other work opportunities, should go to the occupied areas. Because there are still not many people who see this point, the responsibility of the few who have seen it is particularly heavy. As for the main principle of work, it is nothing more than making the Japanese always have to use a large number of troops to maintain the smallest occupied area, so that they cannot rest peacefully for a moment, and at the same time, they do not get the slightest gain. In this way, the progress of the Japanese military only increases their own pain and increases their own burden, and at the same time reduces the power of aggression. Therefore, the more frantic the aggression, the closer the collapse period.</p>
<p>Therefore, I finally want to repeatedly shout: "For the survival of the country and the nation, for the continuation of thousands of years of history, I hope that young people who currently do not have suitable jobs will go to the occupied areas!"</p>
<h3>New Year's Sentiments</h3>
<p>— Tao Xingzhi</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, I wish I could offer sacrifices to the new Qin Hui and visit Grandma Zhao (Note 1) for New Year's greetings. It is gratifying that Yiping became a national shield (Note 2), throwing out the golden bracelet to kill the demons.</p>
<p>Note 1: Grandma Zhao is Zhao Hongwenguo, the mother of the guerrillas, who recently went to Nanyang. She is a simple country woman who, unwilling to be a slave of a conquered nation, abandoned her family, sacrificed everything, and led three generations of her children and grandchildren to fight guerrillas. Her son Zhao Tong is now in various places in Northeast and Tianjin, and most of his troops are still intercepting the enemy.</p>
<p>Note 2: Li Yiping, a second-grade student at the Kowloon Chinese Children's College, is only eight years old. His family is not wealthy, but seeing the national crisis, he resolutely discussed with his parents to dedicate everything in his family to the country. The first time was during the donation campaign in 1937, when he donated his mother's life savings—a golden bracelet. The second time was during the Double Tenth Festival last year, when all sectors of society solicited winter clothes, and he donated 50 cotton-padded clothes. The student has also made the most efforts in various patriotic donations every month. The student's patriotic enthusiasm is commendable, and this is enough to prove that the people's hearts are not dead, and China will not perish; and it shows that the next generation of citizens will be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the country and the nation. The president of the college, Wu Manzhenjun, encouraged all the students to take pictures with the student and gave him the name Guoping. Xinding</p>
<h3>A Story of Bumping into a Wall with a Manuscript</h3>
<p>— Xinding</p>
<p>Since my hometown—Guangzhou—fell, I have been living the life of a refugee, wandering in the refugee camps for more than a month. By chance, I wandered to this island in the south.</p>
<p>Thanks to the care of friends whom I met briefly, I was spared from being sent to a refugee camp. Every day, I felt like a piece of duckweed moving on the water with the wind. When I met a friend who took care of me, I would stay overnight at their home. The next morning, I would drag my pair of worn-out leather shoes, which had traveled 2,500 li on the Long March, and move with the wind again.</p>
<p>However, "This is not a solution after all!" My friends began to think for me: "Why don't you write something? It doesn't cost any capital."</p>
<p>"Yes, how could I forget my pen?" So I started to try this business without capital, for I still want to live, live to prepare to return to the motherland to serve. I had a small wish—to make a living by writing.</p>
<p>I spent two nights writing the details of my escape on the Long March in a small attic surrounded by the sound of "mahjong," a long piece of ten thousand words. There were several special features that had not been published in general newspapers: the police and citizens fleeing in panic, the explosion of the cement factory, the photos of the refugees on the Guangsan Road, the unprecedented grand situation in Foshan, the brave resistance of the conscripted men of Guanshan, the fire disaster in the southwest... I thought that with such novel, detailed, and moving content, plus segmented subheadings, even if the length was short, it would be convenient to publish it in installments. The newspaper would definitely welcome it. Coincidentally, a friend said that he had a friendly relationship with the × newspaper and could send it on my behalf. So this long article was sent out like a giant ship launching in the arms race of the great powers. However, I don't know whether this delivery was sent to the Atlantic or the Pacific. I turned over the × newspaper every day, but I couldn't find my "masterpiece." After asking around through friends of friends, the answer was, "It's too long to be published." The manuscript was not returned. Since this road was not open, and I also received guidance from local friends, who advised me to write something "soft," "interesting," and "short," I read the newspaper supplements for a few days, and sure enough, this was true. However, I remembered that a "predecessor" writer seemed to have said that "learning to write" might as well start with trivial things around you. Doesn't this sentence coincide quite well with the above conditions? So I changed my "style," racked my brains, bit my pen, smoked cigarettes, and recalled the ridiculous corruption and incompetence of the party officials and masters before ×× was lost, and immediately described it in a "relaxed" and "humorous" tone, creating a memoir of about two thousand words, and submitted it to a newspaper that everyone watched, with a half-page supplement. After a day, it was actually "selected"; but the matter was a bit strange, what was published was not the supplement I submitted to, but a certain weekly magazine edited by a certain association, but since his territory was open, and the article had become a commodity anyway, why bother to insist on choosing a customer?</p>
<p>The next day, I saw a new solo drama script appear in a certain newspaper. After reading it, I had quite a bit of feeling, so I immediately wrote a script criticism, also about two thousand words, and sent it to a certain supplement, which was published the next day.</p>
<p>Ah, thanks to God, I can actually maintain my life by relying on the pen that is unique to us cultural people, this is such a happy thing! Estimating my bald pen, in addition to the needs of the rice bowl, I can also buy a pair of soft-soled shoes to replace my pair of broken shoes that have already traveled 2,500 li on the Long March.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, my thoughts seemed to suddenly open up. I also remembered that a certain predecessor writer seemed to have said that to quickly become a literary dragon, you must write more and submit to various publications in order to "become famous." So my head—a small article manufacturing plant—opened night work and increased production efficiency, and new goods were produced every day, and articles were sent to various newspapers every day. But after a week, the products of our factory were returned one after another. Some were stamped with a stamp: "Please prepare an envelope with a stamp," some used a red pen to write a few big characters: "Please send another masterpiece," and some went away like the Yellow Crane, and there was no trace.</p>
<p>A basin of cold water was poured on the top of my head. I silently calculated that the two manuscripts that had been published had been more than a month ago, and I quietly walked to the manager's office of the newspaper and carefully asked if there were any royalties to be paid. "Yes," the manager opened the registration book very enthusiastically and checked, asked for the title and pen name, took out five jiao from the big bag and put it on the table, handed over the receipt and asked me to stamp and sign it. I asked in surprise: "More than two thousand words, only five jiao?" "This five jiao is the royalty for the ×× drama criticism, as for the publication in a certain association's weekly, there is no royalty," he replied very naturally, and handed over the pen at the same time.</p>
<p>Helpless, I signed, stamped, and took the five exquisite jiao, my psychology was like being a humiliated diplomat, signing a humiliating treaty of selling myself.</p>
<p>The royalties received and the expenses for writing the manuscript, such as manuscript paper, stamps, envelopes, and ink, were compared, and the "capital" that was lost was twice as much as the income. The hope of making a living by selling articles finally became a gust of wind.</p>
<p>The result of the high development of capitalism is that from free competition to monopoly. Cultural people growing up in this society are not even qualified to be commodities.</p>
<h3>Starting from Theory</h3>
<p>— Ziyou</p>
<p>Many people have talked about theory and practice, but I always feel that there is something more to say. Because people who often talk about theory seem to forget to explain the meaning of practice to themselves. This is really strange.</p>
<p>Joseph said: "Everyone knows that theory, if it is really theory, will give practitioners the power to determine direction, see the future clearly, have confidence in their work, and have faith in the victory of our cause." This sentence is very thorough, like a mirror that exposes monsters, revealing the true form of a group of counterfeit theorists and giving a talisman to true theory.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun once said: "If you really know the way, you would have already moved towards your goal, why are you still acting as a teacher?" Although he meant to scold those empty heads who claimed to be youth mentors, of course, he did not mean that all youth mentors really did not know the way; but we can also use this sentence to illustrate those empty-headed revolutionaries who claim to be advanced and understand theory.</p>
<p>Really, if they really understood the theory, had confidence in their theory, they would have already moved towards the goal they wanted, why would they be leisurely in "Shangri-La, a safe haven" (?) of Hong Kong, or a more comfortable and safe big city, writing articles, talking about theory, and explaining practice to others.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not mean that we do not want theory, because "without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary action." Theory is the compass of action, and at the same time, it must be enriched in practice. But what we want is not a theory that only calls on others to practice, but a theory that we must also practice ourselves.</p>
<p>There are many phenomena of talking about "theory and practice" without practicing oneself, which has its historical and social roots, and we cannot completely blame those who talk about theory.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the times, the immaturity of various political, economic, and social conditions; so that many theories can only be talked about, and only stop at talking about. After all, people's energy is limited. Naturally, due to the harshness of the current environment, many things will not be as easy to carry out as we imagine.</p>
<p>Taking our friends who talk about theory but do not practice as an example, due to the superiority of their living environment, their determination is shaken; at the same time, because the development of the objective political situation is far behind the development of the military and the enrichment of personal subjective understanding, they can only painfully stop at the stage of "theory."</p>
<p>But even in the worst environment, there is a minimum way to do things in the worst environment. Otherwise, there is no such thing as "practice" in the world, let alone the connection between theory and practice.</p>
<h3>Literary Criticism in 1938</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Regarding the literary criticism circle last year, we can roughly divide it into the following issues for investigation:</p>
<p>1. The issue of utilizing old forms</p>
<p>2. General discussion on anti-Japanese war literature and art</p>
<p>3. Basic issues of literary theory</p>
<p>4. Research on the life, art, and thought of Mr. Lu Xun</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War the year before last, the aggressor's artillery fire burned my country's cultural palace—Shanghai, and the literary criticism circle was quite chaotic: some talked about sad literature; some advocated that the changes in domestic class relations were too fast, and writers could not grasp reality, and works could not be produced; some also shouted about the poverty of form and the difficulty of publishing: all kinds of things, the literary world was floating. But soon after, all these problems were given practical answers by the literary and art circles' life practice and creative practice.</p>
<p>After the literary world stabilized its position slightly, the central issue that was discussed, and is still being hotly discussed today, although there is already a roughly consistent conclusion, but still lacks a concrete implementation plan, is the issue of popularization of literature and art—the issue of utilizing old forms.</p>
<p>Although the issue of popularization of literature and art is not exactly the issue of utilizing old forms. But the center of the issue of popularization of literature and art that we discussed this year is actually the issue of utilizing old forms.</p>
<p>The most people have expressed their opinions on this issue. Roughly divided into three factions:</p>
<p>The first faction advocates unconditional use of old forms</p>
<p>The second faction advocates critical use of old forms</p>
<p>The third faction opposes the use of old forms</p>
<p>The first faction's argument believes that Chinese culture is backward, and the masses are close to old-style literature and art, and new literature and art are incompatible with them. Therefore, if we want to conduct anti-Japanese war propaganda, we can only use old forms unconditionally, as long as we put new wine—anti-Japanese war content—in old bottles.</p>
<p>The second faction argues that old forms have many feudal elements that are very strong and are too harmful to the masses. Moreover, they are fundamentally too far apart from the intense anti-Japanese war content and are incompatible and cannot be used. We should only critically use those old forms that can be used, and as for those old forms that are too feudal, we should not use them. At the same time, when we use old forms, we are actually injecting fresh blood into old forms, so that they can play the role of sublimation and evolution, gradually changing the nature of the forms being used and becoming new things. We believe that this theory is correct; we are advocates of this faction.</p>
<p>Finally, the third faction's theory believes that the New Literature Movement after the May Fourth Movement was a literary revolution and a negation of Chinese old literature. New literature and art have struggled for twenty years to lay a barely stable foundation, and now it is time to move forward bravely. Once we advocate using the old forms of China in the past, is it not reversing the car, is it not negating the May Fourth New Literature Movement? This theory, on the surface, seems to be very grand and crowned, but in essence it is a very absurd and seemingly correct theory. Why? Because these people do not understand history and do not know the development of history. They do not know that the new society is born from the belly of the old society. Similarly, they do not know that new culture and new literature are born from the belly of old culture and old literature. New culture and new literature are the accumulation of the historical essence of old culture and old literature. Negating the old, does the new fall from the sky? It's just that we are not blindly adopting, but critically using and accepting. In addition, some people have proposed the idea of creating new forms to offset the theory of utilizing old forms. A deep analysis of this theory is nothing more than breathing out of the same nostril as the third faction, which believes that utilizing old forms is surrendering to old literature. No more details.</p>

<h3>Li Huitang Sends Letter: Plans to Invite Xu Chengji to Hong Kong for Charity Tennis Matches for Refugees</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Xu Chengji, our country's top representative at the Davis Cup tennis tournament, has been studying in Europe for several years, and his tennis skills have greatly improved. The famous British player Austin was once defeated by him.</p>
<p>It is heard that Mr. Xu has rushed back from Europe to participate in the East Asian Tennis Championship held in Saigon. However, it is not yet certain whether Xu has arrived in Saigon.</p>
<p>One must look at him with new eyes after a separation of three days. If Mr. Xu does return to the East, he will surely make a great contribution to this East Asian Tennis Championship.</p>
<p>When the Hong Kong tennis players Cai Yongshan, Situ Bi, and others left for Vietnam on New Year's Day, Li Huitang asked them to hand-deliver a letter to Mr. Xu.</p>
<p>It is said that Li's letter inquires about Xu's willingness to come to Hong Kong for a visit. Xu is returning to Java immediately after the East Asian Tennis Championship. Therefore, Li intends to invite him to Hong Kong before he returns to Java to hold several charity tennis matches to benefit the refugees.</p>
<p>When Mr. Xu left the country, the crisis was not so deep. When he returns, the land will have changed. It is expected that when he receives Li's letter, he will be moved and may accept the invitation for the sake of raising relief funds. (Dong Lang)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Charity Football: Chinese United Team Loses After Initial Lead, Defeated 1-2 by Western United Team</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] The annual charity football match for the McKean Engineer Cup, between the Chinese United team and the Western United team, was held at the Recreation Ground on the afternoon of the 26th at 2:30 PM. The audience, consisting of over ten thousand Chinese and foreigners, surpassed even the excitement of the visit of the Corinthian team in mid-April. Although the northerly wind was strong, the atmosphere was fervent. Around 2:30 PM, the players from the Chinese and Western teams entered the field amidst applause. The Chinese team wore white jerseys, while the Western team wore yellow jerseys with black stripes. At 2:30 PM, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, accompanied by Mr. Green, the chairman of the Western Football Club, and Secretary Mr. Speakman, entered the field to perform the opening ceremony. At the sound of the referee An Yisheng's whistle, the competition began. Relying on the sharpness of its forwards, the Chinese United team took the lead in the first half, when at 25 minutes, center forward Dai, receiving a clever pass from Jia Youliang, headed in a goal, taking a 1-0 lead. After switching sides, Western United's lucky general, Favan Xiao, scored two goals. The Chinese United team's counterattacks were ineffective, and they ultimately lost 1-2, turning victory into defeat. After the match, the British Ambassador, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, presented the prize on the spot. The splendid Cup was received by the captain of the Western United team, Ma Shan'er. The ticket revenue totaled over five thousand five hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese United Team:</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun</p>
<p>Xu Chengxun, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Yun Fenglin, Li Yichen, Jiang Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua, Jiang Chao, Dai, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Western United Team:</p>
<p>Aikensen</p>
<p>Ma Shan'er, Ke Laituo</p>
<p>Simons, MacClune, Huishe He</p>
<p>Pi Qu, Luo Chailiao, Fulaise, Mike Gen, Favan Xiao</p>
<p>Chinese United Team Wins One Goal in the First Half</p>
<p>At exactly 2:30 PM, the British Ambassador kicked the ball, and the fierce battle began. The Chinese United team's initial attack was blocked, and the Western United team seized the opportunity to attack, but also without success. They alternately attacked and defended until the 24th minute, when Jia Youliang of the Chinese team launched an offensive and penetrated deep into enemy territory. He hooked the ball perfectly, and Dai headed it straight into the corner of the net. Aikensen was unable to save it, and Western United fell behind by one goal. The Chinese fans applauded and cheered. After gaining a goal, the Chinese United team's offensive became more intense. Wan Xianghua dribbled past Ke Laituo and made a short pass to "Iron Leg" Sun, who then passed it to Jiang Chao. Jiang was too eager, and the ball went wide. Soon after, Sun got a throw-in and passed it to center Dai, who turned and shot powerfully, but Ke Laituo blocked the shot. After the Chinese United team failed to score repeatedly, the Western United team became more active. Favan Xiao got a corner kick opportunity, which he took very well. Fortunately, Zhou Dayun jumped up and caught the ball. Pi Qu launched an attack from the wing and passed to Mike Gen, who shot at the goal. Zhou Dayun punched the ball out, but Favan Xiao caught up and kicked it. Zhou caught it again, turning danger into safety. Soon after, the Western United team attacked again, and Luo Chailiao shot from the penalty spot, but it went over the crossbar. By the end of the first half, the Chinese United team was leading 1-0.</p>
<p>Western United's Counterattack Results in a Tie</p>
<p>Switching sides and resuming the game, Western United attacked first, and Favan Xiao's shot was caught by Zhou Dayun. Li Yichen committed a foul, and Western United was awarded a free kick just outside the penalty area. Ma Shan'er of the Western United team took the free kick, but it went wide. The Chinese United team counterattacked and got a corner kick opportunity. Jia's kick was very well placed, and Dai lightly headed the ball, but it went inches wide. Wan Xianghua then took a long shot, but it also failed to score. Favan Xiao of the Western United team dribbled the ball and attacked, and Xu Chengxun failed to block him. Favan shot powerfully from 18 yards out. Zhou Dayun tried to block it with both hands, but the ball was too strong and bounced into the net. Western United pulled back a goal, tying the score at 1-1.</p>
<p>1-2, Chinese United Team Suffers a Fatal Blow</p>
<p>After gaining a goal, the Western United team's morale was boosted. Pi Qu got a free kick, but Fulaise's header failed to score. Ma Shan'er tried a long shot, which resulted in a corner kick. Zhou caught the ball, and seeing Luo Chailiao and Fulaise advancing together, he tried to throw the ball out, but it fell in front of the goal. Yun Fenglin defended and saved the situation, preventing a goal. After that, the Western United team's luck turned for the better. Favan Xiao attacked with the ball, and Xu Chengxun failed to block him. Favan lobbed the ball, and Zhou Dayun jumped up to save it, but the ball hit the crossbar and went in. This was exactly fourteen minutes after Western United tied. The Western United team then took the lead 2-1. The Chinese United team then launched a counterattack, but Western United defended tightly. Finally, Dai passed the ball to Sun, who passed it to Wan, but Wan missed a good opportunity and failed to tie the score. The fans sighed in disappointment. Less than a minute later, the whistle blew, and the Chinese United team suffered a defeat of 1-2.</p>
<p>The Skills of Both Teams Were Comparable</p>
<p>The strength of the two teams was comparable. The Chinese United team's defeat was due to the wrong formation. Li Yichen was placed in central defense, while Xu Chengxun was in the back, causing the midfield to lose contact and weakening the attack. Xu Chengxun was responsible for Favan Xiao scoring two goals. Zhuang Youren was transferred to the winning side, and the left side was also weakened. Zhou Dayun saved many dangerous shots and performed well. Sun, "Iron Leg,"'s passes were unique, and Dai's performance was also excellent. However, Jiang Chao and "Little Wan" could not connect and were ineffective. If Li Yichen were placed in the front, assisted by Sun and Dai, they could break through the center and defeat the enemy. The Western United team's goalkeeper was not as good as Dayun. The defender Ma Shan'er was old and not as strong as Ke Lai. The midfield line was very strong. If Mike Si Gan played, he would have been even better. The two wings, Favan Xiao and Pi Qu, were more active, but the three forwards lacked teamwork. Therefore, the game was very tense.</p>

<h3>Resistance and Sports</h3>
<p>— Li Hui</p>
<p>During the resistance war, we in the sports community have been scattered in all directions, and the vitality of sports governing bodies (such as the China National Amateur Athletic Federation) has largely ceased. This is certainly a great misfortune. Upon closer examination, most of it is due to the environment, but one of the problems is that our country has not paid enough attention to universal and peaceful development. Now, except for a portion of comrades who are slightly active in the isolated island of Shanghai, the only place where sports can maintain a normal state is the paradise of Hong Kong. Here, due to the gathering of refugees and the continuous influx of talent, the dynamics of sports have become even more lively, making it the focus of the country. Fortunately, the sports community on the island is full of passionate people who clearly recognize their responsibilities. In the absence of major contributions, they can do their best to contribute what they can to the rear. Whether it is football, basketball, tennis, miniature golf, baseball, swimming, martial arts, track and field, table tennis, all kinds of sports, fundraising competitions are held again and again to raise money to buy bonds, purchase medicines, buy winter clothes, and provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. The amount of money raised by the sports community is astonishing. Among them, the "All-Hong Kong Sports Community Extraordinary Guard Duty Service Corps" organized by the South China Athletic Association is the most effective. Various football fundraising matches (although the author injured his leg last autumn, I followed the comrades and tried to contribute a little, participating in charity matches and never being absent, which is some consolation amidst my self-reproach), charity calligraphy and painting exhibitions, charity sales, water carnivals, track and field charity events, etc., the work patterns are endless, and the people in charge are also working tirelessly, giving the sports community and other sectors of society the most profound good impression. Other activities, such as the basketball team and swimming team's expedition to Southeast Asia, although they did not achieve the expected results, can be considered to have contributed to the fundraising efforts, doing their part to fulfill the rear's responsibilities.</p>
<p>In short, if everyone carefully studies "Sports and Resistance," they will find that there is a close relationship between them. Unless we abandon ourselves, there is nothing to say. Otherwise, if we are determined to resist for a long time, then we must promote the sports cause, improve sports organizations, and increase the effectiveness of sports. On the one hand, we can strengthen the national resistance forces, and on the other hand, through the justice of sports, we can eliminate the inferior qualities that are still prevalent in our country, such as gluttony, cowardice, selfishness, jealousy, laziness, and fear of death, and cultivate a healthy physique, the virtue of obedience, and the spirit of unity. These are the three essential conditions for resistance. When the final victory belongs to our country, there will be new and great constructions in many places in our country. At that time, if we do not have sound organization, sound spirit, and courage, how can we cope with and complete the arduous responsibilities of reviving the nation and rebuilding the country?</p>
<p>Finally, on the one hand, we hope that our country's authorities will see the importance of sports to the resistance war and its close relationship with the people, and achieve collectivization of national sports through military training (the methods and plans will be discussed in another article when the opportunity arises). But our compatriots in the rear should also recognize their responsibilities. In addition to working hard to save the country, they should also supplement the government's shortcomings, emphasize the development of sports, teach their children, and encourage their siblings to rise from decline and join together to make everyone have a strong spirit and courage to deal with the current situation. I am not talented, but I believe that resistance will be victorious and the country will be built, so I dare to shout to the overseas Chinese:</p>
<p>"The final victory belongs to us!" (The End)</p>
<h3>Strengthening Strength Through Training</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>An athlete who wants to reach the peak must have great strength. Skill is secondary. Now we want to discuss the method of training strength. Strength is long-lasting power. If we lack long-lasting power when engaged in strenuous exercise, there is a risk of overexertion, which is not only not beneficial to health, but harmful, especially to the heart and lungs. The impact on skill is no less than that on health.</p>
<p>Long-lasting power and circulatory respiration are closely related. The heart and lungs are not only the main organs of these two systems, but also the main organs of the whole body. To train long-lasting power, one must first strengthen these two organs. People with unhealthy hearts or lungs must be cautious when engaging in exercises mainly for training long-lasting power. Proceed step by step from light to heavy, and never rush. In fact, as long as these two organs are strong, our long-lasting power will not be too far behind.</p>
<p>In addition, long-lasting power is also closely related to muscles, especially the limbs and arms. Many people, even though they have strong hearts and lungs, feel muscle fatigue or weakness in their legs or arms after running a few steps. This is not because they have excess energy but lack strength. Many people with great physical strength are also like this. Their great physical strength is often fleeting. This is entirely due to a lack of long-lasting power or endurance.</p>
<p>People with unhealthy hearts or lungs who want to train long-lasting power must do more easy and gentle exercises that focus on training the trunk. The so-called trunk is the chest, abdomen, waist, and back. Avoid strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>In addition, the most beneficial exercises for long-lasting power include running, walking, rope skipping, jumping, and various breathing exercises. These exercises are most suitable for people with healthy bodies. However, the most important thing is to proceed from light to heavy and never overexert. People who are not very healthy can also try these exercises, but they must be even more cautious.</p>
<p>Running and walking - these exercises are not only beneficial for long-lasting power, but also for the muscles of the legs. It is best to do them in the early morning. Reduce clothing as much as possible during exercise to avoid catching a cold. The spirit must be particularly invigorated and not be lazy or perfunctory, otherwise this bad habit will be developed when doing other exercises.</p>
<p>When doing other exercises, the hips are important. When practicing running and walking, hold a hand weight in each hand, first clenching tightly, then relaxing, one tight and one loose, until the end of the exercise. This can simultaneously train the wrists and develop the muscles of the forearm. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Movies and Drama</h3>

<h3>US Congress Opens Yesterday - Considers Economic Retaliation Against Japan and Germany - Roosevelt Asks for Massive Military Expansion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The 76th Congress will convene here tomorrow to discuss several extremely important issues. President Roosevelt's opening address will be read to Congress on Wednesday. It is reported that he will emphasize that in view of the deteriorating international relations of the United States, American military preparations should be strengthened. The speech will also specifically mention the President's "Western Hemisphere Defense" plan and the expansion of the Monroe Doctrine to promote joint defense matters among the American republics. It is expected that the US President will announce that in the coming years, this major defense responsibility will be mainly borne by the US Navy and Air Force. He will also request a large expansion of the existing military equipment plan. The US President may explain his views on the outward expansion of authoritarianism. Although he will not mention the three countries that signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, he will make the following statement: In view of Japan's efforts to control the Far East, Italy's expansion into the Mediterranean, Germany's desire for Eastern Europe and Ukraine, and the joint invasion of the South American market by the three countries and their attempts to seize political interests, the United States has no other way to go but to do its best to reorganize its military equipment within the scope that does not hinder its domestic economy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] It is now known that the US government authorities intend to submit to Congress the fact that Japan has occupied Chinese territory and that Germany has discriminated against US trade within its territory. What actions will be taken afterward will depend on the strong expressions of Congressmen and the people of the whole country. If President Roosevelt does not feel that the whole country unanimously supports his actions, he will not exercise the presidential power stipulated in Section 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act. However, it is reported that if the American people unanimously authorize him to do so, the US administrative authorities are prepared to take retaliatory actions. Section 338 of the US Tariff Act stipulates that the President may impose prohibitive tariff rates on imports from countries that discriminate against US trade, and may prohibit the import into the United States of any national goods loaded on ships of infringing countries. If the other party continues to discriminate against US trade, the President may prohibit nationals from conducting any trade with the infringing country. It is reported that a few years ago, the United States only used this intimidation against a certain European country, which was enough to end its discrimination against US trade. The United States has explained this decree and its provisions to the ambassador of the country concerned. At the moment, the US authorities do not feel that they need to implement this shocking step immediately, but according to reliable sources, if American public opinion becomes increasingly agitated about countries that repeatedly provoke, the US authorities will no longer hesitate and will resolutely implement it, especially in the Chinese territory occupied by the Japanese army, where the commercial, educational, and charitable undertakings of US expatriates have been systematically destroyed by the Japanese, and it is essential to respond decisively.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in view of Japan's refusal to the US request to maintain the "open door" policy in China, specifically urged the government to strictly prohibit Japanese goods from being transported into the United States. Pittman vehemently advocated taking this step, even if it meant severing diplomatic relations between the United States and Japan, because Japan would have no interest to gain if it declared war on the United States. Although Pittman only expressed his personal opinion on this matter, he is the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and current US law authorizes the President to order this step to be taken.</p>
<h3>British Government Expresses Position - Attitude Towards Japan Consistent with US - Will Also Issue Strong Note</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] The Central Government is now considering, following the precedent of the US government, to issue a note of the same nature to Japan. It is also reported that when British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, spoke with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, he also raised the various issues mentioned in the US note, and stated that the position of the British government is largely the same as that of the United States.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] Well-informed circles are extremely pleased with the US protest to Japan. Before the letter of protest was sent to the Japanese government, the United States informed the British government of the contents of the letter of protest. This is sufficient to enable the US government to understand that the UK does not need to take the same steps at present. The public believes that the British government avoided taking other actions when Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Craigie held talks. The Japanese government is very clear about the British government's attitude on the "open door" issue and the "New Order in East Asia" plan for Japan in the Far East. The British government and political circles hold a very firm opinion on this point, which is completely consistent with the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The newspapers do not pay much attention to Wang Jingwei's actions, but pay close attention to the American note to Japan. The Washington correspondent of The Times reported that the US government's note to the Japanese government is a summary of the requests made in previous notes, so it is a final overall solution to the Far East issue. The Washington correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" said that American political figures are gradually feeling that the situation in the Far East is becoming more serious, and the US government must take more active actions and should not be satisfied with not recognizing the results of Japanese aggression.</p>
<h3>French-Soviet Trade Agreement - Decided to Extend for One Year - Content Not Revised</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Insk, 2nd] A semi-official source recently announced that the commercial treaty between France and the Soviet Union, which was established on January 6, 1936 and expired on February 30 last year, has been decided to extend for one year after negotiations between representatives of both sides in Paris, and the content has not been revised.</p>
<h3>Soviet Internal Affairs Committee Officials - Five Executed - Fabricated Facts to Frame the Innocent</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] Recently, the Soviet Union again launched a party prison. Five former officials of the People's Internal Affairs Committee in Kiev were sentenced to death today after a three-day trial by a military court for fabricating facts, evaluating and framing innocent people, and illegally arresting people.</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Police - Arrest British Consul - Due to 'Prohibited Parcels'</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 2nd] Reuters learned from authoritative sources that the British Acting Consul in San Sebastian, Mr. and Mrs. Golding, were arrested by rebel police tonight because the rebels found a British Consul's "prohibited parcel".</p>
<h3>Amazing Discovery - London Radio Image Transmission - Has Been Seen and Heard in New York</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] New York's Heiyuan Radio Station issued an amazing message saying that the radio image transmission order broadcast from London's Alexandra Palace has been seen and heard in New York. The radius of radio image transmission is between 25 and 30 miles, but now it is known that it is possible to receive television at a distance of more than 3,000 miles under special circumstances. This matter has now shocked the entire radio industry.</p>
<h3>After a Year and a Half of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiyuan</p>
<p>New Situation on the Pacific</p>
<p>(Continued from page 2 of this newspaper on January 1) Three</p>
<p>Because of the foundation of China's long-term resistance, because of the increase in China's resistance strength, and also because of the weakening of Japan's power, the policies of the democratic theorists (Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union) who have interests in the Western Pacific have undergone a considerable and significant change.</p>
<p>The first sign of the change is that the leaders of the great powers have realized that "in the current international relations, the future depends not only on luck, nor only on conservatism, nor on fate, but on taking active action." (US President Roosevelt's speech on December 5.) British Prime Minister Chamberlain also felt that the basis for maintaining the status quo of peace should be supported by a strong military force. Therefore, 1938 was a year in which the democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States tried to catch up with military expansion.</p>
<p>Let us only talk about the Pacific. This year, the United States' active military expansion in the Pacific broke the record since the European War. On the surface, the US Navy seems to be silent and defensive. As US Navy Admiral Hepburn tried to declare: "There will be no war in the Pacific for the United States." However, US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Reese specifically issued an order this year to cancel exercises in the Pacific. In fact, this silence is its active manifestation. When the British Navy began to withdraw most of its fleet stationed in China to Singapore, and withdrew its submarines in Hong Kong to the newly completed naval base in the Middle East, it was precisely when the United States began to expand its Pacific Fleet, seaports, and air force. Roosevelt plans to build the world's most powerful navy within six years and the world's most powerful air force within 1942. In order to facilitate future operations in the Pacific, the United States is also building Hawaii into the Gibraltar of the Pacific, and establishing a strong air force base with an investment of 11 million US dollars. The United States has also begun to plan the layout of the air force network from the US Ministry of Order through Mexico to Alaska, and its tip is the Hawaiian Islands, which are 2,400 miles away from the US coast. The US Navy Department has also approved the construction of air stations on Wake Island and Guam in the middle of the Pacific, which can be used for civilian purposes in peacetime and for military purposes in wartime. In the next year, the United States plans to build as many as 21 to 32 warships. These facts are enough to prove that the United States is currently taking advantage of the Sino-Japanese War and Japan's inability to compete with each long and short opportunities to increase its strength in the Pacific to maintain all treaties and the Far East Open Door Policy.</p>
<p>After Prime Minister Konoe openly declared the closure of the Far East door on November 3 and amended the Nine-Power Treaty, the United States resolutely defended the existing international treaties and adhered to the principle of the Open Door Policy. Recently, Roosevelt has further rumors of prohibiting the export of major military supplies and military raw materials to Japan, and the Sino-US loans that have been conducted for more than a year have been realized after a year and a half of resistance. This has to be said to be an active phenomenon that has not existed since the Stimson era. The activity of the United States towards the Far East is based on the strengthening of its own strength on the one hand, and on the weakening of Japan's national strength and the increase of China's resistance strength on the other hand.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>The second sign is the strengthening of the jointness of the Far East policies of Britain and France.</p>
<p>We know that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the biggest loser in the Far East market has been Britain. However, under the pragmatism and diplomacy of Chamberlain and Simon, Britain's diplomacy towards the Far East has fully demonstrated its painful and hesitating state over the years. In particular, some short-sighted financiers and industrialists in the Far East are fully expressing their hesitant mentality. Britain hopes to establish a certain agreement with Japan, hoping that Japan can respect its superior position in the Far East, at least in South China, Japan should respect its inviolability.</p>

<h3>Governor of the Bank of England Norman Leaves for Germany Today - To Continue Discussing the Jewish Refugee Issue - And It Is Reported That He Will Meet with Hitler</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] Economic and financial circles here believe that Sir Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, will travel to Berlin tomorrow to visit Dr. Schacht, Governor of the German National Bank, is not purely private in nature. It is generally expected that the financial issues related to Jewish refugees leaving Germany will be further negotiated in Berlin, and some people believe that Sir Norman will meet with Hitler in Bedesgarten, which is also possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The German government has invited Lubry, the US representative of the International Refugee Committee, to Berlin to discuss the issue of the evacuation of German Jewish refugees. It is reported that Lubry has accepted this invitation, but the date of the trip has not been set. When he goes to Berlin, he will be accompanied by another US committee member, Paul, and financial advisor, Cotton.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Tide Eases - No General Election Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] The British Cabinet Tide has now eased. Among the five members of the opposition, two told Prime Minister Chamberlain that the invention that occurred a few days ago could not represent their opinions, and they did not sympathize with the attacks on national defense from all sides. The other two have apologized to the Prime Minister, so these four Cabinet members will not resign. It is reported that Chamberlain is quite satisfied with the national defense plan.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] British Interior Minister Hall has begun to prepare for the next general election, but the date has not been decided. Hall asked local officials to prepare the registers of voters in their jurisdictions. According to the opinions of some political figures, the UK is unlikely to hold a general election before 1940.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Build - Medium-Sized Destroyers - In Response to Germany's Increase in Submarines - Naval Officers Unanimously Agree</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] Beaver, a naval expert for the Daily Telegraph, wrote today that as a result of Germany's request to increase submarines, all British naval officers with war experience are urging Britain to build several medium-sized destroyers, so Britain will build 24 to 30 of these warships this year. He also pointed out that all British destroyers that are now completed and under construction are actually small cruisers of 1,690 to 1,920 tons. He also declared that the naval community welcomed the plan to have 50 medium-sized destroyers of 800 to 1,000 tons. This new warship has a reasonable high speed and is equipped with 4-inch and 4.7-inch caliber guns, and is equipped with several torpedo boats and bombs that can explode 30 to 40 feet deep in the water. He also said that Britain today has a total of 78 destroyers, some of which are old, and the total number of submarines owned by Germany, Italy, and Japan is as high as 264.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd] The German press this morning no longer maintained its silence on the British naval talks. Goering's organ "National News" said, "Germany has no intention of competing with Britain's naval efforts. The procedure for Germany to build submarines does not pose any danger. It only states the wording of the treaty as usual, so Britain has no reason to believe that Britain is threatened by Germany's construction of submarines."</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Italy - Pounce Will Leave Office Next Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Pounce, will retire at the end of his term next April. The vacancy will be filled by Sir Roland, the former Ambassador to Turkey.</p>
<h3>The Last Time the Japanese Political Tide Was Set Off - The Konoe Cabinet Decided to Resign - The Successor Prime Minister Will Be Hiranuma - Political and Civilian Parties Resolutely Oppose Merger</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] According to well-informed sources, Japanese government officials have met several times at the end of last year. As a result, Prime Minister Konoe has decided today to lead his cabinet members to resign this week. The successor is likely to be Baron Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council. It is reported that the main reason for this political tide is due to Internal Minister Suetsugu. Suetsugu is famous for his leaning towards fascism. Today, he firmly insists on the national mobilization of politics. In other words, if he only adopts the existing political parties, the parties must be merged into one, while the Minseito and Seiyukai, which advocate national mobilization and spiritual mobilization, resolutely oppose it. It is also reported that Suetsugu threatened to dissolve the parliament. Once the parliament is dissolved, the so-called "general accounting budget" and the 6 billion yuan "unexpected" budget will not be able to be passed. As a result, Japan's wartime finances will fall into chaos. Therefore, Konoe should hang up his crown before the parliament convenes on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] It is reported that the special budget for the next fiscal year has increased the war expenses for "boxing incidents against China" by approximately 59.4 million pounds, which is much higher than the previous year. The new budget totals approximately 35.3 million pounds. The budget for the previous fiscal year was 29.4 million pounds.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Various Japanese political figures have made various talks in the past few days, and they will probably continue to proceed this week. According to well-informed sources, the content is related to the impending cabinet reorganization, but so far no specific information has been leaked. It is generally expected that this matter must be decided before January 10. The main figures participating in the talks, in addition to the Minister of Defense, are Minister of Finance Tada, Minister of Education Araki, and Minister of Health Kido, but Internal Minister Suetsugu is not involved. A few days ago, Privy Council President Baron Hiranuma and Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa also spoke with Prime Minister Konoe and other cabinet members on behalf of the royal family. Political figures particularly pointed out that the most important purpose of this cabinet reorganization is to ensure the unity of national government orders.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Inspects North Africa; Corsicans Express Loyalty; Gibraltar to Implement Boycott of Italian Goods</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bastia, 2nd] The Mayor of Bastia, while welcoming French Prime Minister Daladier, stated that during the European War, Corsicans sacrificed 40,000 lives. If even an inch of French territory is threatened, Corsica is willing to fight to the last person to assist France. Daladier, currently inspecting French territories in the Mediterranean, expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome, declaring, "I know that you will proceed on the path of courage and honor." Amidst the crowd singing the Marseillaise, he boarded the cruiser "Foch" to head to Bizerte, expected to arrive tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] According to reports indirectly received from Gibraltar, Gibraltar is brewing an economic boycott movement. Italian exporters have been ordered to rapidly transport Italian goods into Abyssinia. The Italian Consul-General in Gibraltar has also gone to Rome. However, the people there are very calm. According to French reports, Abyssinia is showing signs of unrest. The economic situation there is deteriorating due to a lack of money, and except for major cities, other areas have not been conquered.</p>
<p>(Newspaper Attacks French Premier's Tour)</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Rome, 3rd] Italian newspapers report that French Prime Minister Daladier's inspection of Tunisia is an anti-Italian demonstration. Last night, all newspapers here strongly criticized this. "Lavoro" stated, "Daladier's move not only does not alleviate the dispute between France and Italy, but exacerbates it." "Il Messaggero" published an article titled "The Italian Land of Corsica," stating, in brief, that French demonstrations cannot change historical facts. The culture, language, and customs of Corsica originally came from Italian Tuscany. French "Latin spirit" and "Latin brotherhood" rhetoric no longer have any effect in Italy, as Italians no longer trust such hypocritical words.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 2nd] The press here does not attach importance to French Prime Minister Daladier's tour of the Mediterranean territories. It is said that the planned "show of force" (referring to naval exercises) has now been cancelled.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Weimar, 2nd] The Italian "Popolo d'Italia" stated that acknowledging the dominance of the German-Italian axis in Central and Eastern Europe, while also acknowledging their dominance in the Mediterranean, is one of the conditions for maintaining European peace. To this day, the future of Europe is often judged by the actions of the German-Italian axis and the resistance of other countries. This is even more certain than in the past. Future developments will follow one of two paths: (1) Resistance will eventually turn into understanding. If so, we can use peaceful means to shift the current stalemate in Central Europe and the Mediterranean, with Germany and Italy holding the advantage. (2) If this resistance is unreasonable, then the future of Europe will definitely encounter extremely serious difficulties.</p>
<p>(German Newspaper Expresses Support for Italy)</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] People here are paying close attention to the French Prime Minister's tour of Mediterranean territories. However, officials remain silent, apparently unwilling to express much opinion on the matter at this time. The "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" stated, "Franco-Italian relations have become a European problem. If foreigners can understand the clear and unbreakable obligations that bind us to Italy, which have been firmly established by Führer Hitler, then our attitude towards the Mediterranean issue will not be misunderstood."</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Three Points to Note Amidst the Condemnation of Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei's collusion with the enemy has caused a nationwide uproar. The Central Executive Committee has unanimously decided to permanently expel Wang from the party and remove all his positions. From now on, Wang Jingwei cannot rely on his position in the Kuomintang to carry out his conspiracies of stirring up trouble. We have already strongly pointed this out in yesterday's brief commentary. However, Wang's betrayal is a pre-planned action and the exposure of the most vicious strategy in the enemy's plan to subjugate China. They will certainly not wash their hands of this and are preparing for a final struggle. All kinds of rumors, incitements, and divisive conspiracies will emerge one after another. Therefore, amidst the nationwide condemnation of Wang, we in the public opinion should especially point out:</p>
<p>First, up to now, the Central Government's handling of Wang still follows the principle of leniency. This is not for personal reasons, but to give Wang a final opportunity to repent and apologize to the people. Therefore, we must not presumptuously assume that the work of punishing the traitor is already complete. On the contrary, the whole country must be more vigilant and be ready to pay attention to and combat all activities of division, compromise, and surrender.</p>
<p>Second, although Wang's betrayal involves a major conspiracy, he is now facing condemnation and attacks in the country and criticisms and accusations in the international community, and even the enemy side has expressed disappointment. His close associates are also showing signs of division. Therefore, we must recognize that Wang's actions are merely the actions of himself and a small number of national scum, and definitely cannot be seen as representing the actions of a certain faction. Only in this way can a small number of wavering elements suddenly realize the truth, taking Wang as a warning and respecting themselves. Even among those who are serving Wang, there are many who cherish themselves, love the party, and love the country. From now on, they should especially recognize right and wrong and support unity and resistance to the end.</p>
<p>Third, the enemy is clearly using Wang's betrayal as propaganda material. Today, the enemy's news agency has already released rumors of a "Chongqing coup." We must not be deceived! We must know that national scum cannot withstand the tide of the times and will eventually be eliminated. This is a natural law and there is nothing to be surprised about. Therefore, Wang's betrayal is not only not a loss for the Kuomintang, but it has made its organization healthier and its prestige higher because of the Kuomintang Central Committee's stern handling. At the same time, it is not only not a loss for the anti-Japanese national united front, but will make the unity of the anti-Japanese parties even stronger. The enemy's tricks of sowing discord only prove that their efforts are in vain!</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Abolition of the Franco-Italian Agreement and Future Trends</h3>
<p>The diplomatic relations between France and Italy have lost their normal state since 1936, when France did not recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. This time, with the establishment of the Munich Four-Power Agreement, Daladier, in order to thoroughly clarify the European situation and consolidate France's international position, did not hesitate to compromise and yield to Fascist countries in many ways. Taking this opportunity, he re-sent an ambassador to Italy in October, hoping to obtain Mussolini's understanding. Since Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, the presentation of credentials by the new ambassador should have referred to the Italian king as "Emperor of Abyssinia." This contradicted France's position, and the dispatch of a new ambassador was delayed for several years for this reason. This move is generally seen as a prelude to France's formal recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. However, France's compromise and friendly gesture towards Italy not only failed to satisfy Mussolini, but increased his infinite desires. When France and Germany were preparing to jointly issue a declaration of understanding, the Italian Fascist rulers suddenly issued a call for territorial demands on France, which was truly unexpected by Daladier and Bonnet.</p>
<p>Since then, Franco-Italian relations have been strained. Italy has constantly been preparing for war to threaten France into making concessions. At the same time, it notified the French Ambassador to Italy, Ponsot, a week ago, stating that the Italian government felt that the Franco-Italian agreement signed on January 7, 1935, was no longer in line with the needs of the times and believed that it could no longer be effective. The main objectives of the Franco-Italian agreement were: first, to guarantee the territorial integrity and independence of Austria and other small countries in Central Europe to prevent German aggression. Therefore, the agreement specifically stated: "The governments of France and Italy, for the necessity of maintaining the independence and integrity of Austria, agree to decide that when Austria's independence and integrity are threatened by other countries, the two governments may consult with Austria on countermeasures..." The second was to resolve the African colonial issue. At that time, Italy made several demands on France: the most important were (1) that Italians, who constituted the majority of the population in Tunisia, should be granted autonomy, and (2) that the border between French Africa and Italian Libya should be redrawn to approach Lake Chad, and Italy should also enjoy management rights over the French Red Sea port of Djibouti. As a result of the negotiations, France finally agreed to cede 40,000 square miles south of Libya and the opposite shore of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait to Italian Eritrea, and also granted Italy the right to participate in the operation of the railway from Addis Ababa to the port of Djibouti. This is the process and main terms of the successful negotiations.</p>
<p>Now that Austria has been annexed by Germany and Czechoslovakia has fallen into the hands of Hitler, the guarantee of Central Europe has become a historical term. Mussolini's ambitions have lost their basis, and seeing that his ally Hitler's repeated threats of diplomacy have been successful and Germany's national strength has advanced by leaps and bounds, he had to decide to withdraw from Central Europe, which he had coveted for many years, and seek development elsewhere. His followers' calls for Tunisia, Corsica, and Nice, as well as the declaration of the abolition of the Rome Agreement, are for this reason.</p>
<p>Mussolini's declaration of the abolition of the Franco-Italian agreement was intended to imitate Hitler's old tricks in order to achieve his territorial demands without war. However, whether this dream can be realized is questionable. Although the diplomatic policies of Chamberlain and Daladier advocate compromise and even surrender to totalitarian countries, France is not Czechoslovakia. Even if Daladier does not hesitate to make concessions to Italy, given the fervent patriotism of the French people, there is no reason to cede territory to other countries without a fight and willingly be a defeated country. This may be one of the reasons why Italy cannot achieve its goals. Furthermore, once Tunisia and Corsica are occupied by Italy, she can absolutely control the Mediterranean. At that time, not only will France be constantly threatened, but Britain's route to India will also be controlled by Italy. Although Chamberlain focuses on reality, he probably cannot allow him to do as he did during the Munich Agreement. This visit to Italy should be wary of past failures and should not dare to encourage France to make concessions again. This may be the second reason why Mussolini's plan cannot succeed.</p>
<p>Since intimidation tactics cannot work, the next step is to use force. This has always been the consistent policy of fascist aggressor groups. The Eastern Japanese imperialism is like this, Germany is like this, and Italy is no exception. Therefore, Franco-Italian relations have recently turned from easing to tension again. According to reports from various news agencies, Italian troops stationed in East Africa have mobilized a large number of troops to advance towards French Somaliland, and have allegedly occupied six border defense areas. In addition, they have put forward four conditions to France: (1) That Italian expatriates in Tunisia be granted large-scale independence immediately. (2) Allow Italians to purchase uncultivated land in Tunisia. (3) France cede Djibouti and sell the railway there to Italy. (4) That the Suez Canal be jointly managed by the Italian side, while also encouraging Italian expatriates to hold demonstrations.</p>
<p>Italy's finances were already stretched. Especially since the war against Abyssinia, it has become even more strained. Currently, it has felt helpless when developing Abyssinia's capital. Recently, there have been rumors that Foreign Minister Ciano will hire Britain. It has been said that his greatest purpose is to raise debts. It is impossible for such a poor country to engage in war again because of the lack of strength. However, it is also impossible for Italy to stop here. Under this situation, Germany is secretly supporting Italy on one hand and accelerating its aggression against Southeast Europe on the other. Italy is continuously holding a tense deadlock with France, which cannot be resolved for a while. In conclusion, if Britain and France cannot join hands with other democratic countries to form a war front and establish a collective security system, in our observation, the situation in Europe will still be impossible to clarify, or may fall into a more chaotic and tense situation.</p>
<h3>The Summary of the First Phase of the War of Resistance and the Prospects for the Second Phase [3]</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>(Continued from the second edition on January 1)</p>
<p>(2) The scattered nature of the combat forces in the occupied areas and their loss of connection with the overall strategy; (3) The cooperation between the military and the people is still insufficient, and the political work in the military has not been earnestly and fully launched; (4) The mobilization of the masses is unrealistic and not universal, and sticks and ropes replace persuasion and propaganda; (5) The protection of the families of soldiers, the treatment of the wounded, and the propaganda of conscription are still largely inadequate. Politically, (1) due to the conservatism and selfishness of a few people, friction between parties continues, and the anti-Japanese national united front is not consolidated and expanded enough; (2) due to the failure to eliminate some conservative and wavering tendencies within the government, traitors and collaborators are readily used, and therefore the crisis of compromise with Japan and reactionary division still exists; (3) due to the continued resistance of feudal remnants to political progress, traitors and collaborators are even more colluding with pro-Japanese elements to instigate opposition to the government, opposition to the War of Resistance, and preparation for "peace" and "independence"! (4) The oppression of patriotic organizations and patriotic youth, and even the arrest and killing of Communist Party members, continue to occur in various places. Socially and economically, (1) the organization and training of large numbers of refugees has not been carried out in a unified and planned manner, while senior officials and civilians spend lavishly abroad, while the general middle and lower class refugees, although not all end up in ditches, are mostly displaced in other places. (2) Although efforts have been made to provide relief to a large number of out-of-school youth, there is still a lack of more active plans for overall relief, organization, and training. (3) The work of eliminating corrupt local bullies has not been carried out, and all new government policies and laws cannot be fully understood and loyally supported by the farmers and workers; (4) the lack of labor laws and land laws that are adapted to the war of resistance and the principle of reasonable burdens means that the lives of workers, farmers, and merchants have not been adequately improved. Finally, in terms of international relations, although our government's foreign policy has made very clear progress, the central policy is still not firm enough, the foreign propaganda agencies and personnel are still not sound enough, and national diplomacy is almost non-existent. As for the enemy's special agencies and spy networks all over the world, we are not even prepared for defense!</p>
<p>Due to the lack of all progress, and due to the failure to overcome all shortcomings, we have not been able to fundamentally change the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the enemy and ourselves until the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance, and we have not been able to stop the enemy's offensive.</p>
<p>The Current Situation and Characteristics of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>After the successive abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the entire situation of the War of Resistance has undergone new changes. However, Chairman Chiang's message to the nation on October 30 clearly pointed out that "the key to the military victory or defeat of the War of Resistance does not lie in the gain or loss of Wuhan, but in maintaining our continued and lasting strength," and that "the key to the success or failure of the war lies in the amount of active and passive components. The reason why I treat the enemy is to be unyielding in prolonged war, so that the enemy goes deeper and becomes more passive." He clearly pointed out that the abandonment of Wuhan was a "turning point for our country to actively advance and turn defense into offense" and a "pivot for thoroughly resisting the war and turning defeat into victory," which is to say that the future situation of the War of Resistance will basically move towards a "confrontation between the enemy and ourselves," and our task is to strive for all conditions to victoriously enter the second stage of the War of Resistance. According to Mao Zedong's theory in "On Protracted War": the first stage of the War of Resistance is mainly based on mobile warfare as the main strategy, and the second stage of the War of Resistance is mainly based on guerrilla warfare as the main strategy. The first stage is the period of enemy offensive and our defense. The enemy attempts to occupy the three important cities of Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Lanzhou, and connect these three strongholds. However, we cannot therefore believe that we must lose Lanzhou, and that the first stage of the War of Resistance is over only after the enemy has opened up the Yuehan, Pinghan, and Longhai Railways and the Xilan Highway. We should not only, but it is also possible to prevent the enemy from ever connecting Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Lanzhou, and it should also be possible to prevent the enemy from ever capturing Xi'an and Lanzhou, until they are driven out of Chinese territory. Therefore, we can answer the question of "the characteristics of the current situation of the War of Resistance":</p>
<p>The current War of Resistance is still in the transitional period from the first phase (or first stage) of the anti-Japanese protracted war to the second phase (or second stage). And after our efforts in various aspects after the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, this transitional period will also become a thing of the past, and the beginning of this new spring of 1939 will also be determined as the true beginning of the second phase (or second stage) of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>After the successive abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, due to the loss of our major industrial and commercial cities, the occupation of major railways, the territorial division of national power and combat positions, the cutting off of major sea routes, and the difficulties in finance, economy, and transportation, it has become more difficult to supply munitions. These are the difficulties we encountered at the time, and these difficulties still affect the war situation today and in the future. Moreover, the enemy has also begun to plan the establishment of a nationwide puppet regime on a large scale, and is intensifying its conspiracy to provoke internal disputes in our country. Traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and wavering elements are also intensifying their activities of division, surrender, compromise, and so on. These difficulties and the enemy's conspiracies still exist and are developing until the end of 1938. The enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the CPC, which opened on October 14, had already pointed out in its resolution that "differences of opinion may arise in the anti-Japanese camp during this period, and even wavering and local rebellion of certain elements." These are all serious problems in the current and future War of Resistance. At the same time, the unity and progress of our country have also reached a degree of rapid development since the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan. Our highest leader and the people of the whole country are more determined to oppose compromise and resist the war to the end! The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the united front have developed even further. The development of the number of members of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and their political influence have also expanded even further! Our large army that defended Wuhan has quickly and completely transferred, we have quickly deployed new fronts in the Xianggan, Xiangyue, and Gui borders, we have completed great defense works in western Hubei and the Shanxi-Henan area, and we are thus preventing and will prevent the enemy's continued offensive on all fronts. At the same time, we have begun to develop guerrilla warfare more extensively behind the enemy's lines, and anti-Japanese base areas are constantly developing. Our vast and complete rear area, the western provinces, are enthusiastically carrying out all the construction to persist in the War of Resistance and prepare for national construction! All our shortcomings in politics, economy, culture, and mobilization of the masses are rapidly progressing and gradually being overcome; and the temporarily reversed international situation is also due to our unity and determination to resist the war. Starting from the establishment of credit loans to China by the United Kingdom and the United States in December, the international sympathy and movement to aid our country and sanction Japanese aggressors is developing extensively! On the contrary, although the Japanese aggressors seem to have achieved victory on the surface, in reality they are increasingly feeling the inadequacy and dispersion of their forces due to the extension of the front line, and future mountain warfare far from the coast, railways, and major rivers will cause the enemy great difficulties. At the same time, the enemy's rear is increasingly caught in a state of being busy coping with everything due to the widespread development of guerrilla forces. In addition, we should also pay attention to the crisis in the enemy's domestic economy and finance, the high tide of popular anti-war sentiment, and the deterioration of Anglo-Japanese, Franco-Japanese, and US-Japanese relations caused by the enemy's invasion of South China. In front of our strong, long-term, united War of Resistance, the Japanese aggressors can only find the path to their own total collapse!</p>
<p>So, do we now have the possibility of launching a battle to turn defeat into victory? My answer is that there is this possibility. Summarizing the above narration and summarizing it into the following points are the favorable conditions and basis that we now have for entering the "confrontation between the enemy and ourselves" situation: (1) In the year and a half of the War of Resistance, we have not only achieved the goal of exchanging space for time, but also made the enemy pay a heavy price in these "spaces," especially in the hard-fought battles of the past three phases, which consumed the enemy's time for sixteen months, more than 300,000 troops, hundreds of warships, and tens of trillions of military expenses; we still maintain an army of more than two million, and have learned new strategies and tactics in combat and increased progress in political, economic, and social aspects. (2) Chairman Chiang Wei said: "Most of the manpower and material resources of central and southeastern China have been transferred to the western provinces, and the development of the west and the construction of transportation have reached a preliminary basis," and new national defense works have been completed and many new military industries have been created, and many new army corps have been formed. (3) Chairman Chiang Wei said: "In the major areas of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi outside Wuhan, and as far as the enemy's rear in Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Jehol, Suiyuan, Chahar, and the trunk lines of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, we have formulated plans for protracted warfare, and deployed suitable bases and forces, and all deployments have been completed," and there is also (4) the expansion of international aid, and (5) the intensification of enemy difficulties!</p>
<h3>(III) The Situation and Future of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>× Comparison of Our Situations</p>
<p>We must first point out that at the beginning of this second phase of the War of Resistance, the difficulties encountered by our × people were far greater than what we encountered, and were insurmountable. First, from a military perspective, the current distribution of × troops in the five provinces of North China is about eleven divisions, with a force of more than 300,000. However, whether crossing the Yellow River westward or returning to invade the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, no more than 40,000 troops can be deployed. In addition, the forces required in Central China, Jiangnan, and South China are now twice that of North China, and there are still huge gaps between the regions that are within the reach of our government's laws and regulations. Moreover, regardless of whether the × people attack westward, southwest, or northwest in the future, all terrain and transportation conditions will not allow them to exert their unique strengths, but will increase their difficulties; conversely, we only need to continue to maintain and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front-line defense forces, fully adopt new strategies, and use large-scale field corps to stop the × army's offensive; at the same time, behind the × army in the war zone, send large-scale advancing corps to coordinate with the original guerrilla forces to develop extensive guerrilla warfare and seize the × army from the rear; meanwhile, intensify the establishment of new modernized troops in the rear and actively create new offensive forces. Final victory can be guaranteed. Second, from a political perspective, the × people have now penetrated deep into the interior, but cannot achieve their delusion of ruling China. Currently, more than two-thirds of the cities in the five provinces of North China are still in the hands of our army and people. Many collaborationist maintenance societies have been repeatedly destroyed, and the defection of puppet troops and the assistance of workers, peasants, small merchants, etc., to guerrilla forces have gradually spread to Central China, Jiangnan, and even South China. As long as we pay more attention to the fighting in the occupied areas, expand guerrilla warfare, win over puppet troops, win over the masses, establish, maintain, and expand the anti-Japanese regime in the occupied areas, and coordinate with our military development, final victory can be even more guaranteed. Third, from an economic perspective, the × people forcibly occupied the two cities of Yuehan, originally wanting to fully restore business in the Yangtze River coastal area to alleviate the domestic financial and economic panic, that is, to absorb money and raw materials from China to support the war of aggression. However, taking Manchukuo as an example, it can be seen that it cannot meet their current urgent needs; moreover, we already have the existence of the anti-Japanese regime in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region in North China, and guerrilla warfare is very developed, making it impossible for the × people's plan to be realized. All factories, mines, and railways in major cities in Central China and Jiangnan have either been bombed or moved to the western provinces. Even if there is any surplus, it cannot be relied upon for × military production. The situation of commercial trade is the same. As long as we more widely develop guerrilla warfare, especially making the guerrilla warfare in South China and Jiangnan coordinate with regular army operations, then the × people's plan can completely fail. If we can resolutely implement wartime financial and economic policies, extensively develop western production and construction, increase agriculture, and develop inland transportation, then our resources will be inexhaustible in the long term, while the × people will inevitably collapse midway. Fourth, from the domestic situation, the × side has a small country and population, and is not rich in resources. As the war develops further, the military strength will feel more insufficient and scattered, the economic difficulties will become increasingly serious, military production will have no follow-up, and anti-war sentiments in the Taiwanese, Korean, Manchurian, and Mongolian armies will become increasingly agitated, proving that the × people cannot support a long-term war of resistance. We are the opposite. Taking the southwestern and northwestern provinces as an example, there are vast areas and populations, and all construction is progressing rapidly. Even in the occupied areas, we have an irresistible force that will become a major victory factor in the future counter-offensive. Finally, from the international situation, in order to develop its power in China, the × people must eliminate European and American forces, but therefore they must also create more enemies abroad; conversely, after the fall of the two cities of Yuehan, we can persist in unity and resistance to the end, and the movement of British and American powers to aid China and restrain Japan has a new development!</p>
<p>× Our Preparations Today</p>
<p>Due to the severity of various difficulties both internally and abroad, the × people have determined that their policy will always be a quick battle and a quick decision. This year's New Year, the Japanese cabinet will be reorganized again, but this policy will never change—based on this policy. On the one hand, he has no choice but to drain the pond to catch all the fish, implement the National Mobilization Law, and prepare for a longer-term war, but this is a last resort. Their main goal today is to obtain a temporary "peace"—therefore, their future strategy is still planning to attack southwest and northwest: the first step is to capture Xi'an and Lanzhou, and then connect the points of Guangzhou, Hankou, and Lanzhou, on the one hand consolidating the vast occupied areas, strengthening governance, and preparing for a larger war, and on the other hand forcing us to be partial to the western valleys, unable to develop, and then "gathering and annihilating" our main force. However, the × people themselves dare not say that they have any certainty about this dream. In the two months since they captured Wuhan, they have been actively reorganizing their forces, redeploying, and preparing for a larger strategic offensive; but at the same time, they have focused on political offensives. On the one hand, they are implementing a false "pacification" policy in the occupied areas, buying people's hearts, hoping to put the war burden that the Japanese people can no longer afford on our compatriots in the occupied areas; on the other hand, they are particularly emphasizing the slogans of "anti-communism" and "attacking the northwest," and emphasizing the lure of "peace talks" in order to instigate pro-Japanese traitors to induce vacillating elements to carry out activities to divide China's unity. This movement had already been widely launched by the end of 1938. What about us? Since the fall of the two cities of Yuehan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek first issued a letter to the people and telegraphed the Second National Political Council, proclaiming China's determination to unite and resist to the end. Following this, the enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China issued a letter to the national soldiers and people of all parties, sincerely proposing further cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and anti-Japanese parties, and determining the policy of long-term cooperation to build a republic based on the Three Principles of the People. Military leaders such as Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, and Zhu De have successively delivered important speeches insisting on united resistance, implementing a protracted war, a comprehensive war, an active war, and intensifying the political work of the army, not only pointing out the future of victory in the war of resistance, but also pointing out that we have concrete methods. At the same time, in these two months, we have begun to make rapid progress in military, political, economic, diplomatic, and cultural aspects, such as the reorganization of war zones, the unification of command, the adjustment and strengthening of combat effectiveness in the occupied areas, the promulgation of regulations on military-civilian cooperation, the improvement of political institutions in several provinces and cities, the strict punishment of corrupt and oppressive officials such as Deng Ti, the strengthening of mass mobilization, the new achievements of the Second National Political Council, the establishment of provincial and municipal councils within a time limit, the success of British and American credit loans, the implementation of the Western Development Plan, the beginning of the Northwest National Defense Industry, and the successive completion of major national defense projects and new troops, which are relatively prominent. In addition, such as clearing out the few ethnic minority scum and double-dealers in the government, intensifying the campaign to sweep away Han traitors and × spies, and strengthening the close unity of anti-Japanese parties, are necessary countermeasures to combat the current strategy and political strategy of the Japanese aggressors.</p>
<p>The Future of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>In his address at the memorial week for the late President Sun Yat-sen on December 26, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially pointed out to us: "Our war of resistance has entered a new stage. I have repeatedly pointed out recently that the past eighteen months can be called the first phase of the war of resistance, that is, the early stage of the war of resistance. From now on, it will be the second phase of the war of resistance, that is, the later stage of the war of resistance. We now have a really good atmosphere, unprecedented since the beginning of the war, in terms of the morale and fighting spirit of the soldiers on the front lines, whether in the north or south. The general officers and soldiers all know that this Sino-Japanese war is about the × people completely destroying China; for us, it is about fundamentally saving China; therefore, their will is unusually strong and their spirit is extremely positive. The general public is also able to recognize that the × people will not stop until they have carried out their poisonous conspiracy of aggression and will not give up until they have destroyed China. We have no chance of survival unless we seek life from death. Therefore, the environment is full of suffering, but the will of the military and civilians in various places is becoming more and more firm. As long as the front and rear recognize the national crisis, everyone is of one mind, working hard and sacrificing their lives towards the goal of final victory without slackening or surrendering, I am convinced that the goal of the war of resistance can be achieved." The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China in October also clearly stated: "The enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China firmly believes that the great Chinese nation, with five thousand years of culture and a population of 450 million, under the conditions of national unity and long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, under the conditions of the anti-war and anti-fascist movement of the Japanese people, under the conditions of the sympathy and assistance of all advanced mankind in peace-loving nations and countries around the world, will carry out a victorious national self-defense war against Japanese ×, drive Japanese × out of China, and establish an independent, free, happy, and bright new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The bright future has seen the dawn, and the final victory is certain to belong to the Chinese nation!"</p>
<p>It is 1939! Let everyone review their weapons! Get serious! Get tense! Only by enthusiastically and resolutely participating in this struggle can we have our freedom and our victory! The bright future has seen the dawn! Forward! We must have freedom! We must have victory!</p>
<h3>Transportation Facilities Since the War of Resistance Started (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Minister of Transportation Zhang Jia'ao</p>
<p>This overdue highway and waterway transportation conference believes that the southwestern and western provinces are now the base for the War of Resistance and national construction. The development of the inland economy, the communication of international trade, and the transportation of supplies to the front all depend on water and land transportation, and waterway transportation is more economical than land transportation. All important waterways should be used as much as possible, and methods should be devised to connect them with highways or railways to increase transportation efficiency. Special provisions are made for trunk lines of water and land transportation and improved main waterways in the rear, and it is planned to increase ships. The first phase of the dredging project for waterways was resolved to be supervised and handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to be completed by the end of May of the 28th year. To increase ships, the Ministry will be required to rush to build 1,500 wooden boats of 30 tons or less within a time limit for distribution and application.</p>
<p>Since the successive fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, traffic in Chongqing has become increasingly busy. The Joint Office of Water and Land Transportation of the Ministry has specially handled the Chongqing-Kunming joint transportation, transporting by water from Chongqing to Yibin, and then transporting by pack animals to Kunming via the Xu-Kun Avenue, which is beneficial to the transportation efficiency in the rear. In addition, because there are many dangerous beaches in the Sichuan River, ships use manpower to pull them upstream, which is not only time-consuming and laborious, but also prone to accidents. Recently, the transportation of the Sichuan River has become increasingly important. A Beach Management Committee has been organized to recruit knowledgeable and experienced personnel to improve the beach pulling method, and it is planned to first set up beach stations in dangerous places such as Qingtan and Xienan to use machine pulling to make Jiangfang transportation safer and faster.</p>
<p>In terms of aviation, the Ministry also increased the original routes and flights with the development of the war situation, and tried its best to maintain traffic in the face of the × people's destruction of civil aviation, and purchased additional aircraft to meet the needs. Before the War of Resistance, the total mileage of the original routes was 15,005 kilometers. After the outbreak of the war, the routes in various places changed with the war situation. Before Hankou was lost, the Hankou-Hong Kong line was originally changed to night flights to ensure safety. Recently, China National Aviation Corporation opened new routes with a total length of 3,300 miles, and Eurasia Aviation Corporation opened new routes with a total length of more than 6,300 kilometers. There are also about 4,400 kilometers of routes under planning.</p>
<p>(IV) Telecommunications</p>
<p>Wartime telecommunications are very important to the war. The Ministry has specially organized a Wartime Telecommunications Committee to coordinate everything in response to the situation. At the same time, it maintains close contact with the long-distance telephone lines set up by various provinces to facilitate long-distance communication. It is estimated that the Ministry has added 4,480.5 kilometers of various lines during the War of Resistance, and there are still 3,583 kilometers under construction. Therefore, the copper wire used in telecommunications during this year of the War of Resistance can be equal to filling up. It is estimated that eight radio stations have been installed, and 14 are still being planned but not completed. Three telephone sets have been installed and completed, and one is being installed. As for the international radio station, it has already been completed and can directly communicate with major cities in Europe and the United States, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>The emergency repair of telecommunications is similar in nature to railways, and is very important to military communications. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the power lines along the Ping-Han Railway were bombed by × aircraft. For the sake of quick repair and convenient military communications, two repair line engineering teams were organized in Dingzhou, Shijiazhuang, etc., equipped with trucks and bicycles, to repair them nearby at any time. When the 813 Shanghai Battle began, repair line engineering teams were added to the eastern battlefields such as Nanxiang, Zhenru, Kunshan, and Suzhou. Later, as the front line expanded, the number of engineering teams also increased. As of now, there are a total of about 50 teams distributed in various places.</p>
<p>(V) Postal Service</p>
<p>In terms of postal service, in order to meet the communication needs of the combat troops, military post offices were set up immediately after the start of the War of Resistance. The scope of the military post office was limited to the postal areas of Jin, Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Then it gradually extended to the areas of Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other areas. At the end of August of the 27th year, the military postal conference enriched the organization, sorted out the regulations, and became more strict. Now, there are battles in southern Hubei, northern Hunan, and the coastal area of eastern Guangdong, and the scope of the military post office has been expanded accordingly. At present, there are eight general inspection sections, including Shaanxi, Jin, Henan, western Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, eastern Guangdong, and northern Jiangsu. Each general section is set up with several sub-sections for management.</p>

<h3>We Attack Shilong and Dongguan; Guangdong Soldiers Optimistic About the War; 3,000 Puppet Troops in Jiaodong Defect</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd Special] The members of the puppet organizations here are greatly frustrated because Wang Jingwei's advocacy of peace talks has obviously failed. They originally fantasized about using Wang's influence to consolidate themselves, but now they know that there is little hope. The military and political leaders of Guangdong Province, starting with the new chairman General Li Hanhun, will issue a telegram within a few days to refute Wang's views. At the same time, they will also declare in the telegram their determination to counterattack Guangzhou and eliminate the Han traitors in South China. Our army recently attacked Shilong and Dongguan's ×. The × in Xijiang still intend to go up the river to exert pressure on Guizhou Province in an attempt to contain our army's actions in other areas. Our troops in Zhaoqing and Deqing have seen through their tricks and have been strictly on guard. The military leaders of Guangdong Province are very optimistic about the future of the war, and the morale of our army is also increasingly high.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd Special] More than 3,000 puppet troops of Zhao Baoyuan's unit in Jiaodong have defected. Shen Honglie replied to approve and awarded 5,000 yuan. Zhao has telegraphed Wan Fulin and the whole country, expressing his determination to save the country and kill ×.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 2nd] The number of × near Yingshan City has increased to 7,000 or 8,000, some of whom are moving around and disturbing our people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 1st] At 12 noon, we attacked × from the northeast of Taipingchang and fought fiercely for two hours, killing more than 30 ×, including a × second lieutenant, and capturing more than 10 rifles, a × flag, and many important documents.</p>
<h3>Young Military Committee Members Demand Arrest of Wang, The Traitor; Central Government Considering; Report of Arrest of Wang's Followers Not Accurate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd Special] The Central Government does not intend to make any further statements about Wang, pitying him for being foolish for a while, hoping that he will wake up and return to the country. Some young committee members and soldiers advocate a public order for arrest, which the Central Government is still considering. Feng Yuxiang said that Wang had a nervous breakdown. Knowing this long ago, he regretted that Sun Fengming's assassination failed in the past. A statue of Sun should be erected in commemoration. All official newspapers in Chongqing are trying their best to publish news about punishing Wang. Public opinion unanimously criticizes Wang for being rebellious.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Government authorities here deny that any of Wang's party members have been arrested. According to a person in charge of the Kuomintang, Wang only has a few close colleagues who are private, but no party members.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] The swiftness with which the Kuomintang's temporary committee of members took action on Wang's matter surprised foreign observers. Although there have been precedents for such actions in the past, it has never been heard of to permanently expel a senior party member from the party and remove all positions. It is reported that there were no objections from the members during the discussion of this matter, and they all unanimously approved the action and agreed with the statement directly accusing Wang of collaborating with × and betraying the country.</p>
<p>Where Did Wang Zhaoming Go?</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd Special] Although Wang Jingwei has been permanently expelled from the party, the Central Government has not yet issued an arrest warrant. It is reported here that Wang has arrived in Shanghai and there is a rumor that he will go to Nanjing to join the × organization. Wang also intends to move some central executive and supervisory committee members to hold the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang on his own, but since Wang has been expelled from the party, he has no ability to call for it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] According to unconfirmed sources, Doihara arrived in Hong Kong yesterday to meet with Wang Jingwei, planning to ask Wang Jingwei to go to Peiping to quickly take up a puppet position. The political circles here are paying close attention to Wang's future whereabouts. It is reported that Wang's actions are no more than three lines: one is to stay in Hong Kong temporarily, one is to go to Peiping immediately, and one is to sneak to Europe. Some people believe that it is very likely that Wang will go to Peiping, because Wang exchanged views with Wu Peifu on "peace" before leaving Chongqing. Wang's declaration in Hong Kong is especially considered to be the prelude to his plan to go to Peiping to take office. But if Wang's request is not fulfilled, he will go to Europe, either France or Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] According to Chinese reports, Wang Jingwei is in Hong Kong, and is protected by a large number of Japanese plainclothes special agents for fear of being assassinated. He is currently busy meeting with the Japanese special agent organization Doihara and the Japanese consul, and is also discussing with Wu Peifu, Yin Tong, etc., to connect the puppet organizations in Peiping, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou to form a central government, with Peiping as the "capital," Wang as the "president," Wu Peifu as the chairman of the "Military Affairs Committee," and Jin Yunpeng as the "prime minister."</p>
<p>Wang's Defection Insignificant</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] The London Stock Exchange closing showed that Wang Jingwei's defection had no impact on Far East stock prices. Several observers in London predict that Wang will be questioned by some in the business community, but it will be proven in the future that Wang's actions were wrong. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi declared to Reuters, "Wang Jingwei's move is extremely regrettable, but it has no impact on China's resolute and consistent policy."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] The Birmingham Post said, "According to the information we have obtained, the Japanese are dreaming. They are plotting for Wang Jingwei's defection to be the collapse of China's unity. The fact is that it is greatly wrong. The purge of Wang and his party members is a sign of the strengthening and unity of the current authorities. The defection of Wang from the government side will not affect the morale of the Chinese people in any way to Wang's compromise plan."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] After Wang Jingwei telegraphed the central government, suggesting that it accept the Japanese army's peace negotiation conditions, the newspapers here unanimously expressed their patriotic enthusiasm and launched a massive attack on Wang, believing that he was a traitor to the country. The Communist Party's mouthpiece, Xinhua Daily, said that Wang, the former chairman of the Central Political Council, was a traitor to the country and should be dismissed from his official position to strengthen China's resistance. Xin Sheng Bao called Wang an inferior person, and Sao Dang Bao said that Wang's actions were unforgivable.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] According to political sources, telegrams from all over the country and overseas Chinese have been pouring in, unanimously supporting the government's decision to expel Wang Jingwei from the party, and said that since Wang left Chongqing, fortunately the government has taken this prompt action to eliminate various rumors immediately.</p>
<h3>Joint Statement by the Central Propaganda Department and the Political Department, Announcing to China and Abroad</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] Today, the Central Propaganda Department and the Political Department issued (A) a statement to foreign countries and (B) instructions to party departments at all levels and political training personnel in the armed forces regarding Wang Zhaoming's serious violation of discipline and harm to the party and the country. Key points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Statement to Foreign Countries: (1) Wang's departure from the country this time for medical treatment was not disclosed to comrades in the country beforehand, nor was a formal letter sent afterward. It is clear that this was a purely personal action and has no connection whatsoever with the party, government, or military. His actions abroad cannot be regarded as representing any aspect. The leader has already made a solemn statement in the newspapers. (2) Wang's declaration can only represent his personal opinion, or the cowardly and despicable psychology of a very small number of weak-willed individuals who are willing to be utilized by ×. It will not have any impact on the overall future of the war of resistance. Wang's personal opinion is insufficient to shake the firm determination of the military and civilians nationwide to resist the war. (3) As for the Sino-Japanese issue, it is not a matter of a single day or two, let alone a matter for one or two individuals. The central government's decision to resist the war is in accordance with the instructions of the Premier's will and is based on the unanimous demands of the people nationwide. Therefore, resisting the war is our country's fixed national policy, which cannot be easily shaken or changed by the dissenting views of one or two individuals. (4) Wang's statement is probably temporarily deceived by the cunning of ×. However, Konoe's fallacious remarks about Wang are all conspiracies to destroy China. Even if Konoe's statement has the minimum sincerity, it proves that the × is exhausted and has reached the end of its rope. We should actively fight back, recover lost territory, and complete the final victory. How can we seek compromise halfway at this time? (5) Facts prove that the recent peace-seeking smoke screen of × is entirely for a new offensive. Konoe's statement can be said to be a kind of manipulation of Wang. (6) Historically, when revolutions in various countries are about to succeed, there often occur elements who attempt to compromise halfway and defect from the revolution. This is an unavoidable phenomenon in the revolutionary process. Not to mention the distant past, but recently, such as those who defected from the party and supported Yuan Shikai in the early Republic, and Chen Jiongming's betrayal of the Premier, are all exceptions. However, these are still personal actions, not a division of the revolutionary camp. In fact, the revolutionary forces will inevitably become more united and stronger because of this, and its development and success will be more assured. Today, when our great war of resistance is at hand, we must be of one heart and one mind, obey the supreme leader, and be determined to resist the war to the end, without being slackened by the ×'s provocation and alienation.</p>
<p>Internal Instructions: (1) Resisting the war is our party's established national policy, which will not be easily changed due to the dissenting opinions of one or two comrades. The central government's decision to resist the war is not a matter of a single day or two, and there is a basis for it in our party's historical documents. (A) The Premier's will and instructions have long foreseen that the completion of the national revolution cannot be achieved without resisting the war to seek national independence, freedom, and equality. (B) Declarations and resolutions of previous party congresses have all stated that when the nation is on the verge of extinction and peace has reached its last juncture, the entire nation must resolutely fight to resist foreign aggression and must not compromise halfway and hasten its own demise. (2) Wang's public declaration on December 29 last year was an act of betrayal against the party and the country. First, Wang, as the vice president, violated party discipline and went against the party's declarations and resolutions. How can he face the spirit of the Premier in heaven and the millions of soldiers and civilians who died in the war of resistance? Second, since the September 18th Incident, Wang has strongly advocated sincere unity to overcome national difficulties together. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he even more firmly advocated a long-term war of resistance. At the Provisional National Congress, he also enthusiastically supported the program of resisting the war and building the country. He never had different opinions on the war of resistance. Now, at the most critical juncture of the war of resistance, he suddenly issued such a declaration. The contradiction between his past and present actions is so great. (3) The content of Wang's declaration clearly shows that he has surrendered to Japanese imperialism and acknowledged its conditions for destroying China. Subjectively, Wang may not be willing to please Japan and echo the traitors, but objectively, he clearly belongs to surrendering to the × and betraying the motherland. In our revolutionary history, he will forever be the greatest stain. However, we still hope that Wang will repent. (4) However, Wang's departure from the revolution will objectively make us more united and determined in resisting the war. Therefore, Wang's actions will not have any impact on the party and the country. In addition to having one more tool for creating rumors and deceptions, it will not have any effect on ×. Only Wang's personal loss is the self-destruction of his revolutionary history and betrayal of the people and comrades of the whole country. This is most regrettable. However, we must go further and advance the second phase of the war of resistance, eliminate internal troubles, and firmly persist in dealing with × to the end. The final victory can be expected.</p>
<h3>Zhou Zuoren Assassinated in Beiping, Assailants Fled</h3>
<p>[Beiping, Associated Press, 3rd] Zhou Zuoren, a famous Chinese writer, was seriously injured by gunfire from two youths today. When the two youths arrived at Zhou's residence, Zhou was only talking with his colleague. Then the two youths each fired a shot at Zhou, immediately turned around and fled. When they reached the outside of the door, they were stopped by two rickshaw pullers. The two youths then fired at the rickshaw pullers, seriously injuring one of them. As of the dispatch, the fugitives have not been apprehended. Zhou was previously a professor at Peking University. After the fall of Beiping, he did not leave and still taught at Yenching University, which is run by Americans, last spring. Some say he is collaborating with the Japanese, but there is no evidence to prove it.</p>
<h3>American Merchants in China Advocate Economic Sanctions Against Japan, Appeal Sent to US Government</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 3rd] Shanghai Dispatch: The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai yesterday telegraphed the U.S. government, requesting economic sanctions against Japan to safeguard the Open Door Policy. The American Chambers of Commerce in Qingdao and Tianjin will also submit similar requests immediately. [London, Reuters, 3rd] The Financial News here today stated that the United States' strong stance against Japan's actions in China, and its allowance of credit loans to China for the import of goods, greatly encourages those in China with financial and commercial interests. The United States has finally taken a firm stand. The US credit loan, followed by the British credit loan, although small in number, is extremely important from the perspective of the Chinese morale. This situation is still at stake. The war is still going on, so it is not too late for the United States and Britain to assist China as a decisive factor in the fight to restore the authority of the Chinese government and rebuild China's Open Door Policy. Those whose interests are affected in China should study this matter in detail and pay particular attention to the need for swift action. Recent observers are deeply impressed that China's determination to resist has been further strengthened due to the initial expressions of economic assistance from the United States and Britain.</p>
<h3>Jixian Falls, × Showing Signs of Crossing the River</h3>
<p>[Xiangning, Ming Ge News Agency, 3rd] About a regiment of × attacked from the north of Xiangning and captured Jixian County on the morning of the 31st. In the afternoon, a part of the × advanced westward, showing signs of attacking the Yellow River line. On the morning of the 1st, there was fierce fighting between the × and our forces in the area 20 miles west of Jixian County at Guantoushan. It is reported that this route was intercepted by a certain unit of our army, killing and wounding dozens of ×. On the afternoon of the 1st, they still fled to Jixian County. As of now, the × only occupy the mountains near the city, and there is no trace of × more than ten miles away. Certain units of our army have been divided by the north and south mountains to encircle ×, and the river defense forces are also well equipped.</p>
<h3>International Anti-Aggression League Scheduled to Meet at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] The Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received a telegram from the Geneva headquarters stating that the headquarters is scheduled to hold a representative conference in London on the 28th and 29th of this month. It is heard that our country's branch has actively prepared various proposals, and the delegation of the branch stationed in Europe will be responsible for attending at that time.</p>
<h3>Fate of Traitors: Pseudo-Rebels Captured Alive by Our Guerrilla in Baihe Township, Jiujiang</h3>
<p>[Wanjiabu, Central News Agency, 2nd] Yang Xingshi, chairman of the pseudo-autonomous maintenance committee of Baitai Township, Jiujiang, Yang Youcheng, chief of the pseudo-general affairs section, and Duan Fugan, chief of the pseudo-police station, were captured by a guerrilla unit of our army and are currently under interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Scum Join the Pseudo-Market in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] Shanghai Dispatch: The Bank Real Estate Department previously established a loan syndicate in Shanghai with the banking community to develop coastal fisheries, and issued huge loans, stipulating that they should be repaid on time. Due to the outbreak of the war, the loans could not be repaid on time. The syndicate sympathized with the difficulties of the merchants and gave them an extension. It is now learned that a small number of fisheries scum have gathered funds to join the pseudo-fisheries market and to buy shares of the so-called Central China Aquatic Products Association. This kind of behavior is utterly conscienceless. The syndicate and others will never be lenient, and the government will be asked to severely punish these fishermen.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Tianjin Telegrams Not Working</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 3rd] Shanghai Dispatch: As of the 3rd, wired and wireless telegrams between Shanghai and Tianjin are not working.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Disaster Severe: Canal Water Level Soars, Northern Jiangsu May Submerge</h3>
<p>[Shanghai, Reuters, 3rd] According to the International Relief Committee, the great flood of the Yellow River, which has become rampant due to recent dike breaches, flows southeast, merges with the Huai River, and even turns the lakes and canals on the border between Anhui and Jiangsu into water. Then, slowly flowing east into the sea, this area of about 9,000 square miles and 9 million residents will be severely threatened if the Yellow River dikes are not repaired immediately to allow it to flow into the sea in a regular manner.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] Foreign personnel in charge of disaster relief operations say that the Yellow River flood has not diminished. There is a danger that 9,000 square miles of land in northern Jiangsu will sink. The number of victims is no less than 12 million. In the Kaifeng area, there are two breaches in the dikes. The Yellow River water from one place flows along the old course of 1289, and the other flows along the old course of 1887. The water on both sides converges and bravely enters the Dahe River, and there is a danger of flooding in the reservoirs near the canal, because the mouth of the Yellow River has not been dredged, and the riverbed with dikes on both sides is higher than the ground.</p>
<p>Enslavement Education! × Forces Children to Learn Japanese in Occupied Areas (Contributed by Geng Ya)</p>
<h3>Symposium in Xiang-Gui Train, "Part One"</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>On a drizzly, chilly morning, I took a short car ride from Guilin City at lightning speed, and then transferred to the express train on the Xiang-Gui Railway, which had been actively built since the War of Resistance, heading north.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why I am very happy about this trip! One is: Recently, the war in the northern section of the Yue-Han Railway has changed from silence to our counter-offensive. Judging from the victorious reports, it is possible that when I arrive in the Changsha-Miluo area, it will be the time when our heroic soldiers recover Yueyang or nearby strongholds. Of course! We should not be proud of victories, because arrogance leads to defeat; but if one does not rejoice or feel happy when hearing about victories, it seems that this person is also highly suspected of being a traitor. Therefore, some people (including me) are overjoyed and keep talking about the victory of the counter-offensive in the northern section and the capture of famous cities in the outer circle of Guangzhou. I think this is a matter of reason and should not be criticized. Another reason: Since the transfer of troops from Shanghai, I personally have not seen a national railway spanning more than two provinces. For more than a year, I have not seen it. Now I am seeing the newly built ×× station of the Xiang-Gui Railway again, with its wide platform and long rails, one end is connected to the Xiang Province and the Yue-Han Railway, and the other end is accelerating its extension to the international community. On the railway tracks, there are all kinds of vehicles, new and old, and the locomotives have all been fired up, ready to continue to do their best for the war of resistance. On the walls of the station, there are also large inscriptions such as "If the × Bandits are not destroyed for a day, we will never have peace"; "Turn the ×'s rear into our front"; "Endure personal temporary pain, strive for national permanent freedom" and other slogans. These emerging, great, and powerful scenes make people feel an unspeakable joy and hope!</p>
<p>Although some people, from another point of view, cannot help but feel a little bitter, that is, from the handwriting on the cars parked on the tracks, they recognize that they are not cars from the Xiang-Gui Railway itself, but cars from the Jing-Hu, Hu-Hang-Yong, Zhe-Gan, Jin-Pu, Long-Hai, Jiao-Ji, Ping-Han, Jing-Feng (ie, old Bei-Ning cars) and other railways, because the railways themselves that these cars run on have unfortunately been occupied or cut off by the ×. Therefore, they (the vehicles) have fled to this road like refugees. Thinking of this, you will naturally feel a tragic impression of "the country is half-destroyed, the people are mostly displaced; the violent × enter quickly, and the bloodshed is endless," and then, continuing to think, you may even shed a few tears!</p>
<p>However, if you can see through the other side of the problem, you will naturally have a different understanding, making you turn your tears into a smile! The reason is very simple. Before the War of Resistance, these vehicles, so-called each thing has its owner, cannot run around without boundaries. Furthermore, some places deliberately made the tracks narrow in order to cut off contact with vehicles from other roads. But since the War of Resistance, all politics, military affairs, economy, and transportation have implemented a tangible and intangible great unity, implementing a united front. The strange phenomenon that vehicles from various roads cannot cross the boundary has also been swept away, and they can freely advance and retreat from the center of the war to various roads. Mr. Feng Yuxiang, Vice Chairman of the Military Commission, dares to inspect the streets in the southwest alone. Mr. Chen Cheng, Commander of a certain war zone, also tests the public's understanding of the war of resistance in the mountains of Guilin without regard to formality. People like Mr. Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department, Mr. Ji Jianying, Chief of General Staff of the Eighth Route Army, Mr. Ye Ting, Commander of the New Fourth Army, and so on, are very casually attending various public and private banquets in various places. Every time reporters and friends inadvertently meet them, they all say in unison that this reflects a good phenomenon of consistent unity in the war of resistance and no internal problems. If we take the analogy of people as an example of material things, and the military vehicles of various roads can freely advance and retreat to the new roads, who can say that it is not a good phenomenon? Moreover, our war of resistance this time is a scorched-earth war, and we use the principle of fortifying walls and clearing the fields. For all public and private materials in the occupied areas, we should try our best to carry them out in advance. For example, when Wuhan was making a planned retreat, even a rickshaw had to be ordered to be dragged by the rickshaw puller to the Shashih-Yichang area; things that could not be taken away, such as the iron plates covering the gutters on the road, had to be sunk to the bottom of the river. In short, no useful objects were left to ×. We can safely evacuate the vehicles of various roads from the lost areas to the rear for use in a planned way. This not only contains the meaning of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, but also prepares for the counter-offensive in the future, so that they can easily drive on familiar ground, and call them to transport heroic soldiers in separate ways and fight back to their old homes!</p>
<p>——That day, at the ×× station on the Xiang-Gui Road, some passengers, touched by the scene, sighed at those vehicles of great unity, probably no longer have to worry about nothing, right?</p>
<p>At night, when it was time to depart, with a whistle, the express train we were on——"Longhai" green steel skin car, a total of twelve sections including the locomotive, like a green-scaled swimming dragon, shook its head and wagged its tail and headed north.</p>
<p>The "Longhai" green steel skin car is as new, stable, and well-equipped as the blue steel skin car on the Jing-Hu Road before the War of Resistance. Now, far away on the Xiang-Gui Road, "borrowing high-quality materials," we can actually ride comfortably, which adds to the excitement of the passengers. Although it is now traveling on a newly built road with a promising future, because the roadbed is not yet very stable, the express train cannot really run very fast; although recently, the situation in this section of the war has turned better, and the refugees who fled from Hunan Province to Guilin are now packing up and returning north, making the seats particularly crowded; but the general passengers are at ease, and later the train has been running more than two or three times overtime, and I have not heard anyone utter half a complaint.</p>
<p>This express train, which runs every other day (of course, there are other ordinary express and freight trains), is particularly crowded in the third-class seats, and there is no room for foot in the second-class seats. The reporter bought a second-class ticket, but after all, due to the crowding, he could not get in. With the flexibility of the ticket inspector, he was able to move to the first-class dining car, which was not bad. The dining car only provides lunch: breakfast is all "soup and rice," which costs two yuan per plate; lunch and dinner have fried eggs, wonderful cabbage, stewed pork, stewed beef, radish , five dishes, each costing three yuan, plus white rice at two yuan per serving, you can eat as much as you want. This "five dishes and one soup rice" way of eating seems to have been reviewed by some department: it is the same every day, never changing. But the passengers are not foodies, so they are naturally happy to eat it. If your wallet is limited, you can also buy more affordable snacks to eat: soup noodles, porridge, cakes, steamed buns, etc., are all available for sale at each station. Spiced eggs and spiced dried tofu are also sold, and they are sold by people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but they taste a bit different. It is said that the spices cannot be bought completely. As for the roasted chicken sold by the ladies on the Jin-Pu and Ping-Han roads in the old days, two yuan can buy a fat roasted chicken, but there is no roasted chicken here; if you want to eat it, you can only actively prepare to recover the lost land.</p>
<p>The train is running and the long night is long. After chatting a few words with the passengers around you, everyone becomes friends who "regret not meeting each other sooner." There is an armed comrade named Duan, who is an anti-aircraft instructor at a military academy in a certain place. He said: "In the future, due to the shift in the war situation, the anti-aircraft defense of important cities in the southwest will naturally be strengthened day by day due to the concentration of anti-aircraft guns and other equipment. For example, when × planes bombed Guilin several times, they only dropped bombs horizontally at high altitude, and did not dare to drop bombs in a dive at low altitude, because they were afraid of inadvertently touching my anti-aircraft fire network, please let him come down to the land and visit the mountains and rivers of Guilin!"</p>
<p>Mr. Duan, in response to a passenger's question, also said: "Italy is really not a good friend. At first, she said sweet words, saying that she didn't want our Boxer Indemnity anymore; but to transfer this money to her to buy airplanes, as a result, we were a little fooled by him. Fortunately, our source of airplanes purchased from Italy only accounted for the smallest part, so we were fooled very little."</p>
<p>Another friend with a Jiangxi accent interjected: "Italy is not just not a good friend. In terms of their illegal behavior, they have long been the same as the Japanese fascist warlords. In other words, they are indeed accomplices of the Japanese warlords with the same smell. Many Italian missionaries in the interior are working as spies for the × side. The Italian priest in Laohekou has publicly admitted to providing information to the Japanese army. When Hankou was about to withdraw, an Italian priest in a certain church took in more than 2,000 male and female refugees. Eight hundred men were expelled, leaving only more than 1,200 women. They thought they could seek refuge without incident; but fortunately, a Chinese priest in the church righteously informed the outside, saying that the Italian priest was preparing to wait until the Japanese army arrived in Hankou, and wanted to play a trick of 'bringing thieves into the house' with the 1,200 refugee women, and offer them all to the Japanese army as a gift for the allies to see and reward. When the staff of the Third Hall of the Political Department heard the news, they quickly tried to rescue this group of female compatriots who were almost taken by the Italian priest to feast the tiger."</p>
<p>"They (referring to the Italian priests) are guilty after all!" The friend with the Jiangxi accent pushed open the car window, and a gust of cold wind first blew in, making everyone shiver. He spat a mouthful of phlegm outward, closed the car window again, and then said: "Recently, in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, an Italian missionary went to the countryside to preach. He used fluent Chinese and asked a group of children who were surrounding him, as if they were watching a play: 'Where are you from?' The group of children replied loudly: 'We are all Chinese!' He asked again: 'Who are you Chinese fighting with?' The group of children still said in unison: 'Fighting with the Japanese ×!' The priest smiled, seemingly still having something to ask; but a child had already asked him first: 'Foreigner, which country are you from?' The priest answered casually: 'I am Italian.' He would have been fine if he hadn't said he was Italian, but as soon as he said he was Italian, the group of children became a little different. Some clenched their small fists, and some puffed up their small mouths and said: 'Oh! I can't tell that you are still Italian. You Italians help the Japanese × to fight us. We are not patient to listen to your × words anymore. We want to beat you down!' At the same time, the priest's head was greeted with stones of unknown origin, scaring him to run back to the church quickly. He lay in bed in the middle of the night and thought: These rural children still know this, so the adults must be even more fierce!
