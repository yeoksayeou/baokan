<h3 id="c1">華北抗戰之過去現在與未來 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 楚溪春</p>
<p>（一）二十二個月華北抗戰之史的囘顧—其經騐與教訓</p>
<p>抗戰二十二個月以來的華北，尤其是支持華北抗戰重心的第二戰區，其抗戰經過，可分三個階段叙述，幷探討其經驗與敎訓。</p>
<p>甲、第一階段—由「七七事變」到太原失守</p>
<p>一，軍事上防禦陣地戰的失敗</p>
<p>『七七事變』是×人有計劃的，滅亡我國民族的開始，所以在陷我平津之後，卽沿平綏綫向南口進攻，企圖奪取西北門戶，全國堡壘的晉綏。但是晉綏方面的軍事領袖對抗日戰爭，平昔已有詳密計劃。且已根據國防工事而爲適當之部署。特以南口緊急，中央因察省軍隊未能卽時佈防，遂令駐綏西之湯軍並高李等師配以周司令所屬山砲兵某團，以迅雷之勢，在南口佈防，造成南口激然之戰，並爲增援南口反攻北平計，先以陳師歸湯指揮，同時調某集團軍由陝增援，更爲策應該方面作戰有利起見，令傳趙等部，附砲兵某團進襲察北，先後攻佔商都嘉伯寺尚義等地，南口苦戰經旬，×一再增援，迂迴右翼，猛攻不已，奉中央令以涿州西北山地區某部北進作援，並令傅總司令率領所部增援南口正面。湯軍長英勇指揮，予×重創。而所率軍師，於此均遭極大犧牲，終以授軍遠由陝北增援尚未到達，不意察省守軍敗退，張北失守，張垣危急，我軍後路爲×遮斷，于是南口抗戰各軍，不得不向西南撤退，致使反攻北平計劃，未能成功，我×個師損失大半，×乘勢向天鎖猛攻，進襲大同，×大部兵力旣被隔絕于察南，遂不得不將配備國防主張之兵力，王軍長指揮加入大同之會戰，因此致綏東雁北之國防工事，等於雲散，當決定在大同與×決戰，旋因察省守軍先後放棄，蔚縣陽原，×板垣師團得由懷來一帶長驅直入，以窺靈廣，襲雁門，于是大同決戰計劃未能實現。</p>
<p>接着就是晉北各次戰役，×以板垣東條等精鈸部隊十數萬，分路進迫，我軍亦于此時以主力向由靈廣進犯之×出擊，企圖在平型關以外山地先擊破其一路再轉移兵力，逐次殲滅之，當令孫高兩部固守平型關之綫，而以陳郭兩部由團城口附近出擊，無如出擊部隊到達之時，而團城口驗要已爲×佔領，正大舉內侵，致出擊未成，形成堵擊，血戰九日，各部爲爭奪平型關附近山頭，失而復得者九次，計晉綏軍七次，高軍與某路軍各一次，×數次增援，均被擊退，殲×甚多，尤以某路軍某旅在平型關外之小塞村附近襲擊×之兵站及行軍縱隊盧獲甚多，其他各部與數倍優勢及大損失，斯時我軍以××師砲兵×個團之兵力，祖任五百餘里之戰綫，雁門大道×雖始終未能攻入，而集中兵力進攻茹越口，我梁鑑堂旅長，率部苦戰，卒以身殉，×遂佔繁峙北之分水嶺與鐵角嶺。</p>
<p>×由鐵角嶺侵入繁峙之後，卽沿同蒲路南下，我方爲　　大軍集中，命王軍配屬砲兵××團守縣，善玉貞旅附砲×營守原平。王軍苦戰七日，損失甚大，善旅長身先士卒，以一旅之衆與數萬之×，血刃苦戰，城破繼之以巷戰，最後，猶据守三個院落，支持十一日之久，官兵幾全部犧牲，善旅長亦於是成功成仁。有此原平與　縣的血戰，方使我軍從容在忻口佈置，造成空前的「殲×戰」。衛××，楊××，傳××，郝××，李××，高××，劉××，王××，郭××，孫××，陳××等諸將領，分路統率各軍師旅，配屬周部所轄砲兵七個團，由前×衛總司令統一指揮、會帥口，總司令籌劃精密，嚴厲督戰，傳總司令統率晉綏軍數師由正面出擊，浴血苦戰，迭有斬獲，寇兵頓挫，×國朝野震動，屢派增援，力圖一逞，血戰二十三日，最後由野戰而變爲陣地戰，利用坑道攻我，我亦以坑道禦之，斃×三萬以上，郝夢齡軍長，劉家　師長，　淸庭旅長爲堵突破南懷化之破口，身先士卒，均和繼殖國。左翼李明兩部向×側擊，進出廿餘里。朱彭總副司令，更率部斷×後路，阻絕其交通，當時全部×人，已有被我完全包圍殲減之可能，不意平漢綫軍事，撤至石家莊以南，東路×軍進迫娘子關，更突破固關，逐漸西犯，忻口我軍遂不得向南移動，利用太原附近固有工事作依城野戰之計，開始了太原會戰，預定部署，原係以一部守城，生力分置鐵路東西兩側高地，以迅速的計劃聚殲×人。惟以此　東路×復由平定壽陽，分攻楡次太原，而我預定協守太原之各部隊，因參加忻口作戰，多未及時調囘，×已猛迫太原城下，致太原預定計劃未能實現，爲阻止東路×人南犯斷我後方交通，我軍遂逐漸退出太原，向西南地帶轉移，太原遂于十一月八日失守。</p>
<p>二、政治民運工作之發動與開展</p>
<p>戰爭開展的時候，戰區司令長官卽說：『此次對日作戰，不是國與國的戰爭，也不是民埃與民族的戰爭，而是弱國對强國的民埃革命戰爭，必須實行全民總動員，才能應戰』，所以在戰爭開展之後，第×戰區隊積極部署軍隊，堅强抗戰而外，並開始了政治經濟民運等全民總動員工作。</p>
<p>（一）行政機構之改革爲遇應需要在忻口作戰期間，將全省劃爲七個游擊行政區，各派政治主任一人指導並聯絡各縣加緊動員工作，加强行政效率，且於×人深入之後，各縣與省府失却聯系，得代行省府職權，在×後方，維護政樣，同時並更換七十餘縣縣長，另選勇敢負責者充任。</p>
<p>（二）戰時財政政策之決定，根据有錢出錢，大家出力」之原則，公佈抗戰期內縣村合理負担辦法，以改善人民生活，充實杭戰力量，並爲打破×僞免粮免稅狡計，並公佈免徵各項地方稅捐　滅輕人民負祖</p>
<p>（三）組訓民衆之加緊進行。抗戰開始，卽成立省縣村各級總動員實施委員會，加緊動員民衆，雁北失陷後，爲適應戰地特殊情况，又成立民埃革命戰爭戰地總動員委員會。實施戰地動員，而各縣公道團及犧盟會之工作，亦皆以動員爲中心，故各縣村農救，靑救，工救，婦救，各種民衆團體，皆紛紛成立。</p>
<p>（四）武裝民衆的開展。戰前本已有國民兵軍官敎導團之設立，由各村選拔富有民挨意識的知識靑年一萬餘人，集中訓練，原期爲二年，武裝卅萬民衆之下級幹部，訓練未畢，抗戰卽已開始，學員紛紛要求參加抗戰，遂次第改編爲靑年抗×决死隊，更吸收工農份子，擴大編組改爲作戰部隊，幷有太原市工人自願參加抗戰者千餘人，組織工人武裝自衛隊，同時並公布各縣人民武裝自衛隊，及不脫離生產的村自衛隊組織辦法，各縣地方武裝很快的發展起來。</p>
<p>（五）民族革命十大綱領之決定。在此期間，戰事逐漸深入，工作亦逐漸開展，爲確定目標，　一步歷，特決定民族革命十大綱領，對抗戰工作，帮助甚大，並設立民埃革命靑年訓練學校，及隨營政治軍事學校，吸收各地靑年，培養軍政幹部。</p>
<p>乙、第一階段—由臨汾溫泉　會議到吉縣高級將領會議。</p>
<p>一、軍事上機動游擊戰之開展</p>
<p>太原失守後，軍事重心移津浦綫，同時本戰區的部隊在×人兩側和後方牽制×人，致×人未能卽刻向晉南進攻，在韓候嶺綫上形成×我對峙的狀態，給了我們一個休息，整頓，佈置的機會。</p>
<p>在此期間，軍政各首腦機關皆集中臨汾，爲貫撤抗戰目的，適應未來局勢，在軍事的戰略上決定了機動的運動戰與游擊戰，並積極準備其實施，在政治方面，由温泉會議決定了統一認識，統一指導，及統一行動的原則。</p>
<p>會議甫畢，在軍事上爲策應津浦綫之作戰，我軍由左右兩翼分向太原反攻，各地游擊部隊，亦以襲擊×人破壞交通偵察×情等方法，協助正規軍作戰。惟因右翼動作遲緩七八日，予×可乘之機，集中兵力，伺我空虛，襲擊我呂梁山物資儲藏地帶，而前鋒某軍及某師，已由傳總司令率領進出太原附近與×激戰，一時難以調囘，遂不得不以總預備隊之王軍，倉卒佈防，阻×進犯，苦戰經旬，犧牲甚大，趙旅長錫章以身殉職。更急調佈防臨汾一帶之陳軍，星夜前往增援，斯時第一戰區放棄新鄉，東路×軍分由東陽關垣曲等處，長驅直入，不數日間，卽進迫臨汾，候馬，聞喜夏縣等地，節節切斷我後方聯絡，形勢異常緊急。西路兌九谷，大麥郊各要隘，相繼爲×突破，全部反攻計劃未能實現。於是變更戰略，各撤我軍各部，轉入全境各地、展開全而的游擊戰，劃分全戰區爲東西南北四路，各設總司令担任指揮，深入×人後方以奠定游擊根据地之基礎。</p>
<p>三月中旬，×以萬餘之衆，八路圍攻吉縣，同時三路圍西北，四月又九路會攻沁縣，均被我軍擊退。</p>
<p>四月中句，爲策應除州方面作戰。南路軍向×進攻，收復三角地帶，西路軍反攻中陽離石，蒲縣等縣北路軍克復淸水河，向綏蒙挺進，東路軍進攻正太縣，吸引住×人很多的兵力達到牽制×人的任務。</p>
<p>又在一，三兩日內我邊區政府各支隊，及聶榮臻等部先後克復埠平靈廣行唐曲陽等九縣，五日克復昌平，六日攻佔陽源。</p>
<p>二，政治及民運工作的開展與進步</p>
<p>由於温泉會議的決定興推動，這個階段的政治，及民運作工的開展，有如下之進步：</p>
<p>（一）政治機構的健全。臨汾撤退以前，爲保衛地方，將政治區各設保安司令成立保安隊，臨汾撤退時，又由省府下令，各縣人民，武裝自衛隊，及公安局警察均編爲游　支隊，縣長兼任支隊長，這是收治保　組織的健全。政治區改爲行政區，政治主任改爲行政督察專員，幷以陽曲鄉寧中心曾設八九兩區，這是行政組織的健全。設立民革室，促進民革敎育，加强督察工作，幷設立民埃革命中學及各縣　革命小學，這是健全行政的設施。</p>
<p>（二）民運工作的開展。民運方面的重要工作，是動員新戰士，以補充正規軍，並擴大新軍隊，贊動員民衆，鞏固政權，進行救區工作，粉碎×僞組織。更加强農救，婦救，兒救靑救等民衆組織，以保障民衆利益，擴大戰區力量。</p>
<p>丙、第三階段—由囗縣高級將領會議到現在</p>
<p>一、軍隊素質的強化，與民革戰　的效能之發揮</p>
<p>七月一日在×縣某村召集的高級將領會議，我們司令長官曾指出：欲抗×成功，必須先求軍隊本身存在。欲存在須以弱變强，欲成功須以弱勝强，爲要做到「以弱變强」，規定了新補充法，新統御，新訓練法。以期官兵打成一片，軍民打成一片。爲要做到「以弱勝强」，規定了新作戰法，以期在不失機不吃虧的原則下，機動作戰，打死×人，保護人民。</p>
<p>會議以後，爲撇底推行『四新敎育』，曾仆批召訓現役軍官，並在軍隊中用全付力量推行『四新敎育』，規定限期令各按時做到，推行以來，各部隊皆有非常的進步，因而作戰發生了極大的効力：</p>
<p>九月上旬，×增兵離石北犯大武，西攻柳林，十月五路進犯五台區，跟　更在晉西北會攻寧武，晉東會攻和順遼縣，都由我正面各軍巧妙指揮英勇奮戰，以『正面軟項，側面硬打』之新戰法誘×深入而後聚殲，更以軍政民配合空室淸野之政治力量，傳遞情報，適當運用，予以重大打擊，尤以柳林大武一役，殲×兩千餘人，×聯隊長石田亦於是役斃命，大武柳林立卽收復。</p>
<p>爲充分做到民埃革命新的政略戰略的要求，以某師之徐旅進出于汾南稷王山，對同蒲南段予以威脅，同時鞏固我汾南政權，該旅運用新的游擊戰機動戰，配合巧妙的工事，于十月一日之間，擊破×人三次園攻，尤以十一月五日，×人爲進攻鄉吉免除後顧之憂，以步兵約四千餘，砲廿餘門，大舉團攻，激戰竟日將其擊破，使×除死傷數百外，毫無所獲，×砲兵大佐某亦于是役陣亡，但我徐積璋旅長當親身在濟西莊指揮之際，不幸中砲彈忠勇殉國，殊爲可惜，而我軍運用民革戰法，足以勝×確信無疑。</p>
<p>十二月下旬，×軍約二萬，分由東北，東，東南三面，九路會攻吉縣，進迫黃河，企圖西渡，我爲實行民族革命戰法，空室淸野軍政民配合作戰，曾誘×攻入，放到河岸，然後斷其後路，困其粮草，到處設伏夾擊×人，並爲適當的運用新戰法以殲滅×人計，某司令長官親在重圍之中，指揮軍隊，賴人民協助與將士用命，不旬日間擊破×人的圍攻，臨大公路（臨汾至大寗）上東退之×，被殺尤多，然此次各部，因受訓甫畢，運用未能十分靈活，尚能殲×過半，由此足見民族革命戰法。可以擊破×人用武之目的，而打死×人之效力。五台，和順，遼縣等役，卽×方亦曾廣播，受我人民空室淸野之制，飲水亦感困難。更据中央統計，祗二月下半月，全國戰役，共三百六十二次，×傷亡總數二萬餘人，山西方面，戰役約佔七分之四，有二百。二次，×傷亡一萬餘人，佔全國二分之一，我×傷亡比例。我爲一，×爲十三弱，更爲民族革命戰法，足以制×死命之鐵證。</p>
<p>丁、抗戰的經驗與教訓</p>
<p>上述三個階段的抗戰史實。在軍事方面，第一階段是防禦陣地戰，我軍固守一綫，節節抵抗，以達消耗戰之目的，但以此給了×人發優勢武器的機會，使我們受到很大的損失。第二階段，在戰略上採用了機動運動戰與游擊戰，戰爭形勢漸趨有利，並建立了初步的游擊根據地，形成×我相持狀態，牽×人的進攻。第三階段是軍隊素質的强化與民族革制命戰法的開展，各次粉粹×人進攻企圖的戰役，皆顯示了我軍政民化合武力偉大。在政治及民運民衆動員機關，均開始建立，奠定了民旅革命戰爭的基礎。第二階段是抗戰政治，及民運工作的開展期。政治組織逐漸健全。×區政權逐漸恢復，政治效力日漸增大，民運方面，更由組訓民衆工作的進步，民衆對于帮助軍隊作戰，剷除漢奸，和協助新戰士的動員，皆表現出相當的成贛。第三階段，是抗戰政治，及民運工作的健全期。政治上實行强民政治，議服行政，民運上由組織系統的　全，而逐漸强化了組織的力量。因此，我們很明顯的看到：</p>
<p>一，民埃革命戰爭，具有進步的必然性，弱國反抗强國的侵略，妙用民族革命法，不能爭取最後的勝利。</p>
<p>二，陣地攻防戰，我軍死傷較×四倍强，彈樂消耗多，槍彈損失亦多，早以弱對强的失敗戰法。當避免。機動游激戰，×軍的死傷較我由三倍進於六倍以至上三倍弱。我們的彈藥消耗少，槍彈不但不損失，且還有所繳獲，是以弱勝強的成功戰法，當努力！</p>
<p>三，抗日政權的建立，及適應抗戰之政治的推行，摧毀了僞政權的擴展，粉碎了×人統制的迷夢，實行打戰日寇侵略的目的，而奠定了勝利復興的基礎。應當努力健全與推展。</p>
<p>四，建立起抗戰游擊根据地運用軍政民化合的武力，與×作戰。×雖用優勢之兵力，終遭失敗。未建立起抗戰爭擊根据地，軍政民不聯系的作戰，×雖劣勢我雖優勢，無不能收到奇功，故建立抗戰游擊根据地，運用軍政民化合的武力，實爲今日應當努力之工作。</p>
<p>五，民運工作的開展，可以封鎖×人，縮小×區，完成軍政民化合的武力，以打擊×人。惟組訓民衆，能用說服的方式，得到民衆的同情，人民對於抗戰工作，始能熱心而有紀律的服務。若以强制方式，則反易激成反感。所以民運工作爲抗戰勝×之必要手段，而說服方式，又是民運工作風的最高原則，應當極力採用。</p>
<p>六，人民抗×情緒的高漲或低落，與我軍打擊×人的次數，及使×損傷之量數爲比例，我們若能努力的不斷的襲擊×人，不止可以積小勝爲大勝，殲減小×削弱大×，而且可以鼓舞我們人民的抗×情緒，間接有利於民衆動員工作。</p>
<p>七，我們民族革命戰法，增一分功能，減少一分×人侵華成功的野心，就要增加×人一分反戰厭戰的情緒，所以必須全面不斷的佔在主動的地位，殲滅劣勢的×人，襲擊行進間的×人，擾襲停止間的×人，燒×輜重，斷×交通，使×人感覺　華目的不可達成，侵華戰局不能速結，其厭戰及反戰情緒，不斷高漲，其參謀本部的侵華計劃，終必化爲泡影。</p>
<p>（二）華北抗戰×我對峙之現勢</p>
<p>支持華北抗戰重心的第一戰區之抗戰形勢，自臨汾轉移陣地，變更戰略。實行機動運動游擊戰以來，業已轉入×我相持階段，此種相持，不是×人停止進攻的緩衝，而是×人進攻不斷的失敗。就兵力數量言：×人在華兵力，總數共三十二個師團，而經常使用於山西的，時在八個帥團以上，最近更有增調兩個精銳師團，開抵太原之報吿，足見×人侵略山西爲如何積極。就作戰次數及×軍死　人數言，據中央統計，祗二月下半月，全國戰役共三百二十二次，×傷亡總數二萬餘人，山西方面，戰役共二百〇二次，×傷亡一萬餘人，三月以來，祗十三日之戰役統計，又有二百五十三次，更可看出山曲戰況的激烈，及×人進攻力量之衰减。</p>
<p>現在×我形勢，確已走到一相持的對峙階民，這個對峙，在×人作戰能力之衰退，更是我們抗戰力量的增加，同時×人正在壓迫我們，企圖擴大×偽政權：我們亦在積極準備，以期縮小區驅逐矮寇，蒈將×我對峙的現勢，由軍事政治兩方面加以說明：</p>
<p>甲、軍事上的對峙</p>
<p>×我軍事上對峙的現勢，可分爲兵力部署，戰鬥力量，作戰現勢三方面：</p>
<p>一，兵力部署方面。×人現在山西的兵力，共有十個半師團，其部署大多以交通綫及重要城市爲據點。不時調動換防，以眩惑我們的視聽，且由鐵道綫修築碉堡，以鞏固其據點及交通，而防我們破毀，係屬點綫佔據的佈置。我方兵力數量上較×人甚行優越，其佈置，正規軍係依抗戰　根據地分布于習東北，西北東南西各方而對×人形成包圍陣容，游擊隊及自衛隊則深入×佔區域，而出入於×人之腹心，係屬面的佔據，與錐形的突入佈置。</p>
<p>二，戰鬥力方面。侵略國軍隊的素實，在時間持久的形勢下，有退步的必然性，而革命軍隊則有進步的必然性，所以×人的戰鬥力，現在確已衰退，而我們的戰鬥力確已增長，事實的表現。一爲作戰死傷比例，×方逐漸增大，一爲作戰失敗次數，×人逐漸增多，其原因有下列數種：一，山地游擊戰，×人砲火威力不易發揮。二，持久抗戰，×人於屢經頓挫之下銳氣盡失。三，×人厭戰及反戰情緒激增，作戰意志，日漸減弱。四，×人力量不足補充，其軍隊內多摻雜中國人民，此種份子皆係被迫當兵，故毫無作戰意志與能力。</p>
<p>以上皆就×方而言，其在我方者如左：</p>
<p>一1·侵略的反應，激增了我戰士的××心理，而高漲其熱情。二，加强軍隊訓練的效果，統一了全體，官兵的認識及思想，在抗戰高於一切的前提下，漸次走向集體行動的途徑。三，推行四新敎育，由新補充法，新統御法，使軍隊漸次以弱變强，並由新作戰法，使軍隊漸能以弱勝强。四，戰爭烽火的鍛鍊，激增了士兵的作戰勇氣與技能。五，民運工作的開展，及游擊根據地初步建立，軍民漸次打成一片，逐漸完成×人不可進攻的力量。</p>
<p>三，作戰的現勢方面，就現實戰役觀察，×人目前正多方進犯，積極向我壓迫，表現了進攻的積極性。同時並於侵犯地點，趕修公路，如最近迂修　樂，神池汽車路之類，似有穩紮穩打企圖，又表現了進攻的堅決性。但在事實方面，多方進攻，多方失敗，表現了企圓的不能達到。並且每次進攻，其下級官兵，只求達到進攻地點，不求擴大戰果，及完成佔領使命，十足的表現出士無鬥志的敷衍狀態。</p>
<p>我方則正在運用機動的作戰方式，不斷的向×人襲擊，以爭取戰略主動，並運用軍政民化合的武力，建立×人不可進攻的抗戰游擊根據地，實現　室淸野，以粉碎×人進攻的目的，更逐漸推展，以縮小×區，達到殲減×人的目的。</p>
<p>乙、政治上的對峙</p>
<p>日寇侵略中國，最感困難的一點，卽爲政治統治力量的不足，尤其第×戰區，一年來我方政治力量的發展，奠定了縣村抗日政權，武裝了縣村民衆，使×人的政治力量不能達到鄉村，更足加深×人的困難與不安。所以×人處心積虛亟謀挽囘其統治力景的頹勢，加以戰對我們的改治進攻。我們則認爲×人弱點的所在，照準×人弱點進攻，可以致×人的死命而加强其崩潰的速度，所以積極加強行政機能，開展民運工作，以强化政治鬥爭，因此本戰區×我對峙的形勢，政治對峙反較軍事爲嚴重。</p>
<p>×我政治上對峙的現勢，可分爲爭取民衆，擴展政權兩方面：一，爭取民衆方面。×人爭取我們民衆的手段約有兩端：一是威脅，二是懷來，侵佔的前一段。殺人放火奸淫擄掠，威脅勝於懷柔。現在則以威脅激起反感的原因，更利用我們同胞句安自私的弱點，以數騙利誘的手段，加深懷柔，有時更以威脅濟懷柔之窮。在×人以爲我們同胞，缺乏民族意識。用欺　方式給以茍延生活的希望，自能使之坐受宰割，間有不受懷柔的。更以威脅方法，可以迫使忍受。豈知懷柔政策與侵略行爲原相矛盾，所以事實的表現，懷柔終是口調，終爲一種希望。不　運用威脅之時，超越威脅範圍。成爲一種殘害，且在高　懷柔的過程，一般侮辱蹂躪的事實，仍在不斷的發生，因爲懷柔是一種欺騙，欺騙是不能持久的。</p>
<p>我們的政治，是站在民主自由的立場上面，是站在保障民衆安全及利益的立場上面，是救亡的政治，是强民救民的政治，組織民衆，是根據民衆要求組織的需要，且要使民衆了解組織的需要，我們的工作，已漸次走上强民政治，說服行政的路上，已逐漸喚醒民衆的覺怏，使民衆有了抗戰必勝的信念，各鄉村皆組織了救亡團體，及自衛隊，時間愈　長，將必愈有進步。</p>
<p>二，擴展政權方面。×人擴展偽政權的理勢，一爲僞組織的擴展，一爲僞行政的强化，前者用强迫及訓練的手段，玫漢奸逐漸增多，但一般漢奸旣無事權及人格的保障，不特被强的陷于苦悶，且皆陷入悲觀情　之中。後者的表現，一爲東縛政治的强化，其辦法爲嚴格調查戶口，限制我民衆的自由，漸次僞編組自衛團，皇協軍，實行「以華制華的政策。」爲實行奴化敎育，是　倒是非，欺騙誘　的言論，愚弈我民衆，眩　國際的視聽。一爲限制我法的流通，以破壞我金融。</p>
<p>我方抗日政權的擴展，雖×人勢力深電的地方，亦皆建有縣區行政系統，並皆本民主的精神，由下層做起，以建立民意的政治，其行政方面。　用說服行政，以實行利民政治。同時更　取及剷除漢奸，以摧毀×偽政權，瓦解×僞組織。並積極强化區村行政機能，以阻止×僞政權的擴展。</p>
<p>（三）華北抗戰的未來趨勢</p>
<p>日×侵略中國，原取不戰而勝的蠶食主義，自七七事變遭到我們的强烈抵抗，威脅政策。不可以繼續，遂更標榜三個月征服中國的在言企圖以速戰速决的政策，使中國屈服，戰端旣開，我國抱定抗戰到底的决心，再接再厲，堅强抵抗，時間的延續，日×旣感到國力不足支持長制作戰的危機，更高　唱打下武漢，卽可以結束戰爭，屈服中國的論調，以圖刺激其士兵，　動其民氣，詎知武漢旣下，中國不特不能屈服，且士氣愈堅，人心愈奮，因此日×的侵略形勢，遂深陷於膠着狀態，無以自拔。</p>
<p>今後日本究用什麽策略，打破目前擱淺局勢，就現在形勢推測，將不出進玫西北西南，或肅淸已佔地區的兩個途徑。本來武力侵略的目的，原在減亡對　與屈服對方，若旣不能滅亡，又不能屈服，自失了侵略的目的，中國抗戰有廣大的領土，與堅强的意志。日寇非僅侵佔了武漢，不能滅亡中國，屈服中國，卽使冉能深入，亦不能達到滅亡屈服的目的，何况×人現在的人力資源皆已沒有再行補充的力量，所以進攻不僅不可能，且已失去了目的，然而日寇今日要保持佔有的權利，並要在佔有權利中補介其實力，因而不能不加强佔有地區的統治，以圖肅演我游擊勢力，更因肅淸佔有地區，非一朝一夕之事時問延長，容易疲耗兵力，增加民衆反感，激昂反戰空氣。而引起內變。所以在肅淸後方的中間，更必運用冒險進攻的行動，內以刺激其國人，刺激其軍隊，外以炫惑世界恫嚇我國人希圖妥協，故今後日×侵略戰爭的途徑，必以肅淸佔有地區爲主，而以進攻西北西南濟其窮，因此華北尤其是華北邊塞，全國堡壘，西北門戶的第×戰區，其抗戰形勢必將愈　嚴重。</p>
<p>日×今後將如何肅淸華北進攻山西。我們由目前×人侵略形勢的動向可以看出，一，强化政治侵略，以搖撼我們的精神，奴化我們的民衆，將圖擒奪我們的人力資源，用向我們進攻，以達其「以華　華」的陰謀，二，擴大地方僞組織，如偽自衛團呈協軍之類以攻擊我×區的抗日政權，牽制我游擊自衛隊的活動。三，猛烈進攻我游擊根據地，希圖壓我正規軍，使之無法存在。如是必使我抗戰形勢愈趨艱苦亦惟如此，始足以激奪我們抗戰奮鬥，更　積極。</p>
<p>目前我們的抗戰力量，正在不斷的滋長，大多數民衆，逐漸覺悟起來，大的新戰士，不斷的動員起來，他們有堅强不屈的意志，有奮鬥到底的決心。我們的軍隊正在走上政治領導的路上，將因×人進攻的積極，加速其進步，建立現代化的新軍隊。</p>
<p>游擊根據地的建立今後必愈　鞏固，我們將必完成軍政民化合的武裝，先用空室淸野辦法，塞住×人的耳，住×人的眼，封住×人的口，再用破道路的方法掩住×人的眼，更用民衆報吿消息以睜開我們的眼，以粉碎×人進一步企圖。且由×人進攻的積極，將必由事實需要的切及經驗的鍛練，增加完成的速度。</p>
<p>我們認爲實行民革戰法，確爲爭取最後勝利的必要條件，我們今後必能在「不失機」「不吃虧」的原則下，爭取主動形勢，以不斷的進攻×人，打死×人，且因×人進攻的積極，更應加強民族革命戰法的效能，以粉碎×人進攻企圍。</p>
<p>我們的行政民運，必將依據現有的基礎，向前發展，更凶×人政治壓的嚴重，增加了工作開展的機能。</p>
<p>因此，我們相信我們今後的抗戰，確是變觀的，勝利的，只要我們本着民族革命的精神向前奮鬥×人的進攻，雖如何嚴重，亦終可將其擊敗，况日×現在進退爲難，其兵力已較前衰弱甚多，在不能滅亡與屈服我們的形下而進行肅清後方之舉，已屬萬不得已的下策，雖一再鼓其餘力，張大聲勢，終不過强弩之末而已，迫處末路的侵略者，今日只餘此一着棋，此著再破將一蹶不振，勝利之期不遠，我們當如何努力以作最後之奮鬥。（完）　（民革社通訊）</p>

<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>本報特約通訊稿</p>
<p>×人邇次在鄂北一帶的動作，早在我們預料之中，記得一月以前在××遇到李德　先生的時候，對於×人於三月中旬進攻漢水流域的原因，以及目前×我力量的對比，和將來這一綫戰事可能的發展，皆作過極詳細的分析，而李德鄰當時的佔計，恰成爲最近×人軍事動向發展　實事，觀于我軍布置的週密，力量的充足，以及×人此次集四師團精銳以作猛烈之進攻，故對於戰况之激烈，雙方傷亡之慘重，原爲意料中事。然而看了×人的宣傳，今天說包圍我幾十師，明天說殲滅我幾十萬，誠如　館襄的說書先生，吃西瓜皮講大話，什麽『於百萬軍中取上將之首級如探囊取物耳。』什麽『大刀飛舞，殺人如切菜。』非但不能置信，並且聽之令人噴飯，覺得過於滑稽。</p>
<p>四月廿九日記者抵××，參觀游擊幹部訓　班，凑巧得很，那天正是該校全體師生歡送湯恩伯敎務長上鄂中前線的盛大衆會，主持者爲幹訓班主任自崇禧陳辭修二先生，梁寒操，周恩來，主餘生等亦皆在座，有歌詠，有話劇，有京戲——狀况非常熱烈，情緒極爲高漲，尤其是湯恩伯將軍臨行時的一篇演講，更爲精彩動人，使我覺得他不獨是忠勇的戰將，同時更是個對於政略戰略極有深刻的了解和修養的時代天才。故最近隨棗兩縣之間能創造與台兒莊有同等收獲的戰績，這並不是沒有客觀原因的奇遇。另外我覺得張自忠和他的參謀長劉家鸞先生亦都是在抗戰中進步，在鬥爭中發育的人物，很得士兵的信仰和愛戴。這次拉住×人的後腿，切斷×人的後路而血戰於××××兩公路上的部隊大部皆由張向忠指揮，四月五日記　與他們相會於鄂中軍事重鎭荊門。儘管×人那時於多寶灣羅漢寺等地，終日不斷地發砲朝漢水西岸沙洋一帶轟擊，裝出大　渡漢水沿漢宜公路而取成宜昌的姿態，可是張總部却已開始北移，並分別渡河而預先於××，×××之間的扇形地帶布置防務，以作先發制人。因爲當時×人在漢水東岸的力量非常薄弱，不過是第三師團的兩個聯隊而已，把現在的事實和當時的估計對照起來看，則更顯出各將領對於×情　斷的正確。所謂知己知彼，才能百戰百勝。</p>
<p>襄陽與樊成隔漢水而對峙，爲三國時代　魏爭霸中原的軍事據點。取襄樊下南陽以威脅關中，亦爲今日×人戰略中的市要企圖，可是本身力量不够，和客觀環境的多方困難，終使遣日本軍閥的空頭支票成爲　　難以充飢的苦惱。記得一個月以前的某天晚上，皓月當空，照耀在靜靜地長流着的漢水河頭，我們與李宗仁將軍夜談戰况，他以爲×人動員到中國各戰場的兵力，總共約有十四個師，可說已到達了×人最高的動員飽和量，然而，這三十多個師，的兵力分散在，國各點上，正如石投大海，其作用極爲微查。單以長江南北岸講，除了公路上或沿江幾個重要據點之外，其餘大部份皆爲我游擊隊所光復。保守旣不可能，進攻自然更形困難了。武漢撤退以來的四五個月中　×人不能有所動作，這樣一來，一方面要引起國際人士對于×人力量的懷疑，另一方而則又恐國內的政治要起變動，故進退兩難，乃不得不如疲牛之　重車更深地陷于泥途。其結果不過是得此失彼，愈深入則愈困難。最後李宗仁將軍還很堅決地說：『日本帝國主義者多行不義必自斃，終蹈一九一四年歐戰時德國慘敗之覆轍。』</p>
<p>記者個人的看法以爲鄂北戰事還是一種攻勢的防禦戰，一方面可說是分兩路進襄樊，企圖以外線的包抄的姿態達到殲滅主力的目的另一方面則又爲保　武漢　固據點的內綫外園戰，因室×人可以武漢爲交通中心，運輸接濟校爲容易，三月間×人于攻下鍾祥京山等地之後，卽建築堅强工　乃留少數都隊守此新建築之軍事據點，接着卽分兵協助南　線上的部隊進攻南昌。故當此×人正圖攻襄　的時候，我們亦決不忽略了長沙×人無恥的廣播機早以在那裏狂吠三月取南昌，四月取長沙的話。現在事實吿訴我們，這荒　的誇張，已被我英勇將士們的偉大精神打得粉碎了。</p>

<p>【中央社重慶十日電】滬外訊、英駐滬總領事費利浦今日對綸昌廠及了克勒被害事件、向日領署提出書面抗議、要求日方迅速制止反英運動、并特別說明下列數項、</p>

<p>邊區政府</p>
<p>華方最大之獨立區，在平漢路西廣大多山區中，舍有晉緩察冀諸省各一部份，成一緊強之氏。人口一千四百萬。該區會一度包含整個冀中在內；一九三七年日軍進侵之初，地方政府大多摧毀，日軍退囘或經過後之一時期中，行政入於完全混亂狀態中。一九三八年初，未受日軍直接侵佔之各區代表，在保定以西鄰近晉邊之小城　平舉行會議，組織所謂區政府者，接掌仍能獨立區域之行政權。此乃一種流動之政府，循適於應付日軍時常出　之方針而辦事約歷半戰，該政府始得鞏國其本身地位，且使各縣陸　恢復秩序。去歲十一月，日方大批援軍抵華北，自東興西，卽自平漢路與東浦路　大舉進犯，俾肅淸算中。迭次作戰約五閱月，日眾獨失基重，始得侵佔黃河南岸將及半途之各城鎭，旋因發現其進犯後復退却之制度，未得滿意之結果，乃决更雙方法，而開始駐守冀中更大之城鎭，職是之故，三四月間續有援兵約五萬名開抵華北，邊卽湧入演大之區域。然地廣兵少，仍感不敷分配，故雖增援，仍不能謂爲已對冀中作有效侵佔。</p>
<p>游擊戰爭</p>
<p>游舉隊現仍握守四鄉，藏身於廣大平原上如星羅樓布千百封落中。因游擊隊於離去前，已將多數城鎭之城　拆毀。故日軍只得守於有刺鐵絲網障碍物後，且呈不穩之象，而於四週區域中，並無勢力之可言。日軍縱已侵佔一城，對于一綏靖鄉郊，毫無把握。蓋物色其人，進行當地任何種行政者，因難日甚也。當日軍迫近一城時，人民奉令離城，僅地痞之流留居，任事於日軍指使之下。實屬一種險艱工作，因遭游擊隊捕獲，卽加槍決也。四　區域內之農民，不復携農產入實已　蕪之城市，故日軍不得不用下車自最近火軍站運輸一切給養，游舉隊在汽車路上橫掘深六尺之　濤，至卡車運輸，大受阻碍。著名原棉供給，爲日軍進犯華北目的之一，亦成幻想。舊游擊隊已歡農民勿再權棉，致共產額，聞已滅少什八。按據目前方針，日軍今後極能希望樹立奏敎之行政機關，在華北全區辦事，恢復內地之和平與秩序，殊難明瞭。日軍此前所採取，現仍繼續採取在內地共他部份進襲，摧毀村落，而歸咎於游擊隊之舉動僅能增加混亂，迫使史多之人加入該隊，且使日軍之給養與交通，大增困難耳。最近駐守內地一切侵佔城鎭之計劃，苟能適當駐守，其結果或能較有效果，但軍力不足而出此，實較無用尤爲惡劣。無論如何，廣博之多山區，日軍仍未能優佔之。若干專家認爲日軍須至少復調五十萬人，始可肅淸華北，然日軍似不願出此，故日軍何日與如何能吿竣是項工作，殊難逆料也。（不月十五日發）</p>
<h3 id="c12">禮榆：黑市外匯猛縮之原因 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>前日匯豐銀行外匯掛牌行市雖然仍守向來的基準，但是實際上暫停供給，因此謠諑紛興，買氣頓盛，一日之間竟由八辨士四分之一，縮至七辨士左右。至於猛縮的原因，市場上傳說不一，有謂三月間設立的二千萬鎊外匯基金業已用　，有謂各友報將不願繼續供給外匯，諸如此類，惡意宣傳充斥市場，這實在是　意破壞法幣與投機者另有存心的關言，絕對不足爲信。</p>
<p>關於外匯基金的問題，據日方最惡意的估計，每月約須供給一百五十萬鎊，方才可以維持八辨士四分之一的水準，所以某金成立的時候，日方卽發表意見，以爲一千萬鎊基金雖能維持七八個月，然而外匯基金成立迄今不過二月餘，卽以日方惡意估計而言，也絕無用　之理，所以這種謠言實在不足置信。</p>
<p>英美各友邦與中國　密切的商業關係决不願因爲法幣匯價的下落而影響其對華的貿易，其中尤以英國更爲關切。過去的許多事實已足證明英國支持法幣的熱意，外匯基金的設立，更足以表示其維護遠東利益的決心。各友邦的商業利益旣完全與中國利益相一致，而中國抗戰又有反敗爲勝的徵象，則各友邦，決無不願繼續維持法幣之理，所以這種謠言完全是超出常識範圍以外的。</p>
<p>至於匯價猛縮的眞正原因、實在是破壞法幣的惡意宣傳與謀陰政策。</p>
<p>最近上海市場日鈔汎濫，價格下落，最低的時候，曾經跌到法幣每八十九元可換日圓百圓，這顯然的是日本經濟力薄弱的表現；日本名義雖說是戰勝的國家，但是在經濟上已經顯出不能興中國匹×的事實，日本知道還是他捫弱點的暴露，也就是中國長期抗戰勝利的徵兆，所以必須設法掩蔽，務使日圓的信用高出於法幣；然而他們雖然運用各　手段制。日圓的下落，終不能挽囘頹勢，日圓雖曾一度囘復到九十五元，（每百日圓的價格），但是前日又下落到九十一元。他們知道日圓的信用是不易恢復的，於是轉變方向，攻擊法幣，想使法幣路價以後，相對的恢復日圓的地位。</p>
<p>同時「華興銀行」雖然從五月十六日起正式開始營業，但是因爲法幣信用的鞏固，所謂「華興券」者就不能獲得地位。從開始營業的日期起至五月底止，華興券　的發行額只有二十二萬圓，並且都是用以徵發佔領區域內人民物資的，租界內始終未見其影踪。日方知道此計不售，茫由於法幣匯價的穩定，所以又擬攻擊法幣，間接的援助一華興券」。</p>
<p>因爲上述的二種理由，最近日方就以其所收的法幣（這是用「聯銀券」及軍用票換得的），大掛的套取外匯。從中國方面說，自從外匯基金成立以後，本來應付綽有餘裕，不過　此戰時，外匯的重要，逾於往昔，如其聽任日方任意取無異是持機資×，有以為保持中國的元氣及防禦日本的陰謀起見，不得不限制外匯的供給，這是防訊法幣的手段，非但對於法幣的信用無害，幷且反而可以鞏固法幣的基礎，</p>
<p>從上述的情形看來，我們可知法幣的信用是毫無問題的，暗市匯價的下落實在是蓄意破壞法幣者的陰謀詭計，倘使大家承認法幣是本身利害之所　，應該力持鎭靜，觀察事情的眞相，勿爲言所惑，免得擾亂法幣信用，而自環長城。</p>

<p>救濟戰區失業師資</p>
<p>如何克服抗戰新階段的新困難，以爭取最後的勝利？如何培植民族新生的力量，以樹立將來建設國家復興民族的基礎？這是當前中國解放運動中最嚴重的間題，也是目前中國全民族最迫急最重大的任務。我們要完善解决這些問題，和澈底完成這些任務，主要的是在於推進與澈底實現全民族精神與物質的總動員，是在於普遍的切實的保育與培養我們國家民族未來的建設者，在這裏，我們就迫急需要十百千萬的宣傳者，組織者。訓練者，和領導者！中小學和專科教員的地位和任務便顯得格外重要了。</p>
<p>然而抗戰廿三個月以來，不僅多數師資教養機關不能繼續存在，因此缺少大批適應抗戰建國新需要的師資，而且由於抗戰以前之缺少全盤的準備，抗戰以後又無整個的計劃與統一的步驟，因此原有的師資亦多隨戰區的擴大而離棄其職務，在×人的炮火之下失業，死傷，流亡，至如淪陷地區的師資，則除了業已直接參加抗×反漢奸隊伍的以外，多數已在×人漢奸的淫威之下，非遭利用，監禁，殺戮，亦多顛沛流離。第三次全國教育會議，有鑒於此，曾有關於救濟戰區失業師資的央議，而最近報載，西北若干地區，已在進行一切積極的救濟工作，江蘇省亦於日前頒行救濟戰區失業師資的辦法，而廣東省當局，似亦早已在港進行救濟失業兒童及小學教員登記等工作，我們除了要指出必須同時注意培養大批適應抗戰建國需要的新幹部新師資以外，對於救濟戰區，淪陷區及流亡海外的失業師資，亦當視爲當前最重大的事業。</p>
<p>不過我們同時必須注意：第一，這種工作，係根據抗戰建國新階段新需要的一種全民族的主要任務，不祇是一種消極的救濟，尤應爲積極的組織與訓練。所以我們除了應該進行更大規模的登記調查以外，還要積極籌備成立這些組織與訓練師資的機關，授以適應抗戰建國需要的基本知識，如關於全國團結，長期抗戰，三民主義建國綱領和適應特殊情形的戰時教育方案，方式和方法，以及戰時服務方法等。第二，這種工作應該在戰區，在淪陷區，在後方，以至在海外，普遍的切實的進行，一面要適應不同區域的特殊條件，一面則必須有一致的精神與統一的領導，卽是要不違反革命的三民主義的原則，和統一戰綫的領導。此外在方法上，我們要一體遵從最高領袖蔣委員長和關係當局的領導，同時要號召教育界文化界領袖及中外社會名流，一致協助進行。</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>——英蘇談判——英德關係——英法與德意——西班牙的爭奪——巴爾幹——徬徨——英土公約——希臘——羅馬尼亞——南斯拉夫——</p>
<p>李維諾夫辭了職之後，接着，英蘇間常時在密雲不雨着的談判，就鬆了下來。現在，本來預備到日內瓦去開會的蘇聯代表，現任外次的波丹金，在幾天前，却忽然中止了預定的行程；於是英蘇間已經進行到相當程度的合作談判，方始暫時擱置。以目前的情形判斷，大概在最近，這談判是不會眞被重新強調起來的。</p>
<p>這種英蘇間談判的擱置，實際上僅僅是一個現象，一個結果，而絕不是原因。她的原因是什麽呢？主要而又直接的，有兩個：第一，在光明方面，是由於最近英土公約的成立，因而從英國立場看，她已經把未來的英蘇同盟基礎，完全械下了；現在，環繞在蘇聯一週的國家，大多已經和英國有了相互或片面援助的協定；這，在她想，已經表示了對蘇聯合作的完全誠意，至於進一步確定機和蘇聯間條約上的同盟關係，那，祇是一個程序問題；然而這程序，在英國目前還沒有下最大决心打擊全世界侵略集團國時，她是不感到必要的。從蘇聯立場看，因爲不久前，波丹金到巴羅幹半島及波蘭一行之後，他已經確定了各國對蘇的信賴，所以在周圍各國已經和英國成了立同盟之後，事實上，她也不必亟亟於去和英國同盟。於是在本　上，英國苟安下來了，蘇聯也懈怠下來了。第二，在黑暗方面，最近英國內部，因爲莫索里尼在杜林比較和平的演說一發表，對德讓步派的勢力，又拾了頭；他們還在歡現政府對德冉作一次嘗試，以某種可能離步，作爲希特勒接受「和平」的條件，而請他具體地提了出來。於是，現在駐德大使韓德生，就接到了命令，立刻向德國當局提出兩點意見去：（一）如果德國眞是希望和平　的話，那末，應當趁現在英國逗『顧意聽』的時候，趕緊提出來；（二）不然的話，依他『個人的』竟見，英國現在，已繼完全立於對德優越的國際軍勢地位上了。所以，常英國在本質上已經苟安了之後，在外　上，她故意弄得如火如荼，成天地在宣稱着談判英蘇合作，而另一面，又在幕後進行着對德討價還價的交涉的時候，這時，爲了外交的運用，蘇聯就採取了波丹金的忽然中止日內瓦之行。</p>
<p>這樣一來，英蘇談判，就　時擱置了起來。順帶着，而也短時期緩弛下來的，是歐洲的整個局勢，不過大家應當立卽密切地汪意到：在另一面英蘇的當局，却因此又墮入緊張的網：蘇德的　衝可能，是不是又在進展？——像一個毒　似的，這問題，在目前是一直強固地，嚙着英法苟安論者們的心。</p>
<p>於是這一兩天來，英法的與論，又在聲勢蓬勃地，壓逼着政府；而政府也祗得再趕緊採取步驟，去向　聯担保。</p>
<p>作爲　來哈立法克斯和龐萊巴黎談話最主要項目之一的就是這。</p>
<p>這些，就是歡洲目前最主要的趨向。可是在這事，我們碰到了一個問題；爲什麼？在目前旣然英法祇望和蘇聯保持不卽不離的一致立場，主要的是去和德意講價的時候，但一聽到德備緩爾的音影，却又這麽焦急了起來？</p>
<p>這問題的答案，目前最緊急的一　，是在於地中海形勢的緊張，所以目前全歐洲的目光，却在集中於地中海上正在發展中的風　演變。</p>

<p>有一次，歐洲時局緊漲的常兒，有六個國家的外交代表，去見莫索里尼。他們先在客廳里等着，一會兒，客廳的門敞開了，一個噓噓的聲音慢慢傳來，他們靜寂地向門口望着。</p>
<p>「諸位早安。」等到六位代表反過身來，莫索里尼早條個埃及性神似的站在他們的背後了。但是，那里一點門的痕　也見不到。</p>
<p>談完話之後，老莫說：「謝謝諸位，下午四點欠十分，給你們的囘音。」</p>
<p>三點五十分，六位外交代表又走進了那間客廳，一會兒，門又敞聞了，號噓的聲音也來了。可是，六位代表先生這次可聽明了，都面向著牆那一面死釘着望。</p>
<p>「諸位午安。」六位代表趕緊囘身，莫索里尼卻早微笑地站在門口了。</p>

<p>一　運金子的船</p>
<p>新聞紙上，全用大字登載着，德美航線的快掄「凱隆柏齊號」，由美國載了六百萬鉅額的金條，到德國去。她啟碇的那天，轟動了一大堆的人趕到碼頭上看熱鬧，擠得水洩不。</p>
<p>這不過是一艘鋼鐵製的航船，裏面有着大量的財產，便吸引了這些人們。雖然，很不容易猜想他們期望看見些什麽，但是，也正如有些人會注視着一所監獄一樣，在那裏面分明是　　著一些罪犯，他們出神地望着那四堵灰色的牆，却并不是希望自己也能進去享受一下。所以，在「隆伯齋」的碼頭上，這一羣，也用他們的好　的目光，恣意的紅視眘這個藏有巨額黃金的大寶　箱。</p>
<p>在人羣中，兩個褐色皮　的靑年，手裏拾著行襄和提箱；好容易擠了出來。</p>
<p>「眞了不得，傑克！」一個叫起來。他正用手肘推開兩個胖大的男女，那男的癡望着船邊，一絲都沒有讓路的意思，那女的張大着嘴，眼睛凸出着，似乎她希望把那黑色的船身著作黃金色。</p>
<p>「是呀，金子是一塊大收鐵石，　管它已經包扎起來，送進了船上的銀庫了。」答的是傑克雷德。『比　，搭在這樣一隻船上，我們感到自己也像百萬富翁了。』</p>
<p>「這也是假期中的一　享受」比爾南諾笑起來了，『若是古時的海盜還能活著，這眞是他們的好機會來了，那　我們航行在這「　隆伯齊」船上，也就眞可以看「番驚險啦。」</p>
<p>傑克是邱克斯郵船公司亞加號上的無線電員，比爾則是機械員，因爲他們曾　將邱克斯先生失去的弟弟找囘來，邱克斯特別允許他們一個假期，他們就决定了在這假期中去旅行歐洲。</p>
<p>其實，在他們踏上這運金船的時候，歐洲的一些軍械已經在軋軋的昨響了，逬且。在好幾個鐘頭以前，這個幾乎普遍全球的大戰，已經注定了會爆發起來，對於這事，自然，他們是一點預感都沒有，他們正　着將他們的物件放進船艙裏去。船上的汽筒鳴嗚吼起來，一陣顫動穿過巨大的船身，她離開了碼頭，鋼樂隊開始演奏起來，甲板上的人羣，和碼頭上的人羣，努力地揮手。　時候，簡直沒有法子分辨出這些雜的聲音。</p>
<p>「好了，到底開船了。　克，比爾說，他挽着　克的臂，並屆靠在船　上，望看　的高聳雲霄的摩天樓道着一再會』。</p>
<p>傑克則向那高　地升在天空的兩根危桿呆望着，兩桅杆之間，有着無線電的天線在盪漾。</p>
<p>『想着現在由人家在發無線電了，眞有點特別的感覺。』他懶瀨地說，輕輕地在念着無紤電的號碼，表示「再會」。</p>
<p>「夠了，我從來也沒見過這樣的人！一比爾叫起來。「動且忘掉你那永無休止的無線電吧但是——」他突然叫起來，「那是一個我們認識的人』。向他們走來的，是一个靈敏，矮小的人，上啓有一撮乾淨的鬍子，穿着得很整齊，似乎帶點過於神氣的樣子。</p>
<p>怎麼，那是法飛行家魯　加羅呢！我們在弗羅里　海上救過他的財！」傑克喊着。</p>

<p>— 老舍</p>
<p>提　今日中國的文壇，我們可以毫不遲疑的說，牠是立在全民抗戰的旗幟下，盡省的掌起救亡圖存的號筒。全民族都在血裏掙扎，文學中也很難再找到對風花雪月讚諛與欣賞；假如偶然見到風花雪月對話。牠們的顏色也必是血紅的。整都的文藝簡直可以被稱為一首戰歌。</p>
<p>詩人，戲劇作者，小說家，文藝理論者，都携起手來，組織了全國文藝界抗×協會。派別，意見，在平日把文藝同志們分開，卽使不互相敵視，也是各自為政，不相往來。七七的砲聲，激動了心感每銳的作家們，每個人面前擺着同一景物，每個人心中只有一個共同的仇×，自然而然的大家就把筆尖都朝了外。協會政策只有一個，就是精誠團結，爭取民族的勝利，會員們在極端困苦的生活中，去寫作，去宣傳。誰來教他們寫，他們無不樂從，只要所寫的是有關於戰宣傳的。他們也到民間，到軍隊裏，把詩，歌，壁報，小說，獻給民衆與士兵，作爲精神的食粮。</p>
<p>在詩的方面，因了抗戰，所以力求激昂明顯，能夠朗誦，以明能打入每個人的耳中，　起愛民族與抗巨暴的熱情，而且，幾乎每天在報紙上都可以見到可歌可泣的事實，鄉民小販每每成爲民族的英雄，歌吟這些英雄事業的責任，自然也是責無旁貨的屬於詩人，詩人的光榮，到現在，已成爲民族光榮。</p>
<p>戲劇是必須表演的，因而也就更合適于宣傳，都中裏，鄉村中，為募寒衣，獻金，慰勞傷兵，歡送出征，都有戲劇與演員的活動，這種活動，不知引下多少士兵與人民的眼淚，在慰勞傷兵演劇的時候，每每有受傷的弟兄，高喊『再上前綫』，而且眞，就奔赴前方。</p>
<p>報吿文學更是天之驕子，牠眞實，簡單，生動有力，後方的人民關切着前方的兒女，前綫約弟兄切盻着鄉土的消息，這眞實有力的報吿，不但是報吿着享賀、也將　族之心打成一片。</p>
<p>長篇小說還未能出現，爲求立竿見影的收得宣傅實效，短篇小說因爲簡短方便，就適應需要而大量產生。其中有許多最極好的作品，因爲所寫的都是作家眞　經驗——在軍隊中服務或在被×機追逐着的流亡中，或尋過了被燒殘的城市。或有見了肢體分離的同，都是寫作的材料而且是不能存儲在心中，必須馬上寫出的材料，誰能把這些慘絕人寰事實埋藏起來呢？。詩，戲劇，小說，大體上說起來，都爲抗戰面力求粗壯明朋。可是，文人們知道，這些東西還恐怕不易為不識字的同胞所了解，卽使是有人念　他們聽。於是，文人不得不和用民間原有的文藝形式，照着民間打着　　的戲劇配着弦子唱的最書，敲着竹板念的歌詞，去製造一些新的東西，使識字的能讀，不識字的能聽。這種通俗的作用，也正在盡量的產生，爲的能深入民間，作廣泛的宣傳。</p>
<p>在幾個很小的城鎭裏，你也許能看見一張中學生抄寫的壁報。在這張壁報上，你能看見簡短的戰事消息，小小的論文，挿着圖的故事，和一兩首詩，或民歌；新的民歌。啊，你就知道了。文藝的各種體裁都在街頭應用着，都爲抗戰而服務；就是民歌的形式也沒被遺棄。由這張小小壁報，你可以想像出今日的中國文壇。</p>
<h3 id="c31">論抗戰文藝批評的弱點 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 黃繩</p>
<p>理論家用兩句話指出抗戰文藝的弱點，說：「作品落後於現實，批評落後於作品。」特別是後　——批評，的確是抗戰文藝活動中的最無力的一環，他的加緊和補強，也就成爲最近一般文藝工作者的一致的要求。</p>
<p>自然，我們也不是沒有批評，我們的批評也不是沒有一些成績，茅盾的「八月感想」，祝秀俠的「實現主義的抗戰文學論」，艾思奇的「抗戰文藝的動向」，向林冰的「抗戰以來通俗文藝運動的發展與缺陷」，等等，都是優秀的批評：一般文藝刊物，經常有書報評述，那自然都是批評；以至在許許多多報紙雜誌上發表的文藝短論之類，又多是批評性質的，這些批評，我們不能說牠對於作家和讀者沒有起過作用；祗是還很不夠，很無力罷了，所以我們現在若說要展開批評工作，加緊批評工作，單背調批評的重要性還不夠，遺要進一步檢討過去的批評的弱點，以便探究今後批評的具體路線。</p>
<p>第一，一般文藝刊物，經常有書報評述，一些進步的報紙　刊也常有評介文藝作品的文章，那裏也有着優秀的結實的批評之作，比如茅盾在「文陣」發表的一些書評，雖然多是介紹性質，却時有精確之論，像不大經意地寫來，却透露着理論的光彩，是值得我們學習的。</p>
<p>然面好些作者的評論，却不能使我們滿意，那裏面往往祗有作品梗樹的敘述，加上　象的甚至可有可無的評語，說好的方面，便是主題有積極性　人物創造相當成功；說不好的方面，便是把握現實還不夠，氛圍描寫不大正確，等等，他們不切切實實地指出作品的好壞，所謂批評，寨實上也就止於作品梗概的介紹而已，文人間近來有一種相重的風氣，這是好的必要的；但相重不是彼此客氣，不能因而忽略了必要　互相批評，而現在許多文藝朋友却正坐此弊。這也是批評工作落後的一個因素，所以我覺得，像張振亞「評田間近作」，（文戰一卷二期）那樣的切實的不客氣的作風，實有提倡的必要。</p>
<p>我們批評的對象！一個特定的作品和一般作品同是在抗戰中的中國社會的產物，和一般作品有多方面共通的地方，所以我們進行批評的時候，應該保有以一特定作品爲主例而批評一般作品的態度。我們批評了一個特定作品的一點，應該就是建立了或具體地闡明了一點理論，那是可以給人家作爲剖解一般作品的利器的。在這要求下，那些攏統的批評當然成爲毫無用處的東西，我們要從一般作品中來看一個特定的作品，我們的批評能夠從殊特中看出一般，同時從一般作品中來看一個持定的作品，我們才能夠探出作品的特色。給予一個它應得的評價，—這是附帶說的</p>
<p>第二，抗戰文藝是中國的年靑的文藝一個新的發展，在這二十多個月中，牠沒有偉大的成就，以至心急的朋友第二次向文壇提起生產偉大作品的問題；然而的確是在加速發展中，文藝刊物和副刊，在數量上比之戰前是有過之而無及，而且不像以前集中於上海一隅之地，隨着現實的要求，作家的散處，和各地新人的陸續出現，文藝的花芽在不同的士壤裏茁長出來。在這新的聆展情勢之下，偉大作品雖還禾產生，而新樣式，新氣見的作品却陸續出現。這些作品出現，也許它是大作品產生的前奏，許多　詩，敘事討，演講文學，通俗文藝都是抗戰期間的交藝特產，批評工作者怎樣「對付」這些特產呢？</p>
<p>遺憾得很。多數批評工作者對於新樣式，新氣息的作品，似乎不大關心，沒有提出來給人家特別注意，沒有發揮牠的優點，沒有批判牠的缺陷。一個新樣式的作品出現了，沒有引起各地愛好文藝的朋友的注意，討論，研究，而遭遇了自生自滅的命運，縱使是優秀的，有發展前途的，也沒有人去繼續創作和發揚光大，這是抗戰文藝的極大損失。這損失的招致，批評工作者要負很大的責任，今後我們要切實補救批評工作中的最弱的一環。</p>
<p>第三，文壇七出現了不少長論和短論，不冉有輕視論文或祗是販賣一些舶來品的風氣，這是進步的現象。那些論文部分是批評性質的，而且有過優秀的作品；但一般弊病在沒有具體分析作品入手。祇是說抗戰文藝這不行，那不行，應該這樣，應該那樣，却沒有設到那些作品犯到你所指責的毛病，他的病態又是怎樣，所以雖然言之成理，却有時令人摸不着邊際，也就失了批評的作用。</p>
<p>最近有人主張我們應該從速舉行一個抗戰以來的文藝作品的總檢閱。若說批評工作有必要，這總檢閱便是必由之道，不從檢閱作品入手，粽合的批評論文便成為無的放矢，對於作家和讀者都少有益處。</p>
<p>以上說到的是極其粗略的幾點，還請朋友們指正和補充。</p>

<p>— 文愈</p>
<p>—讀「華北前線」—</p>
<p>不是新聞紀事，不是小說，更不是論著。「華北前線　這書，我以為應該把它當作報吿文學的巨著而閱讀和珍視的。</p>
<p>「雖然日本的侵略已駭人聽聞地降災禍與苦難子中國，然這血和火的洗滌卻同時已在中國的舊社會中創造了進步的勢力；假使這些力量能夠不受到阻礙　他們或許　將這多苦多難的國家改造　個如孫總理的自由民主的政體。</p>
<p>「整個武裝的民族，已慢慢地有着統一的指揮了。而世上任何軍隊遇到這復興的中國的全力時，　將粉碎和失敗。」（一朝臼不昇了」）</p>
<p>這是多　敏銳的觀察，堅定的信念　——勃脫蘭氏對這次空前大戰的結語是明確而有力。他這部二十五萬言的巨著，就是以形象來透露這偉大的結語。——我們是要感謝的！</p>
<p>作者向戰前的日本作個瞥視。進入北平已是戰號嘹嘵的時候。他別了一美麗和冷淡的古都。踏上赴陝北的旅　，在積雪的群山中度過一九三八的新年。當他冉見那一陰暗中的北平，重遊瘋狂的島國，而又斷念地離開時，已是「台兒莊大戰」之後，戰爭的「第二個春天」了。</p>
<p>作者記下了平津揭幕戰，平型關，忻口，陽明堡的戰役，然而只是以象的細綫；他　毛澤東，朱德，賀龍，蕭克，劉少奇，王震，趙承綬等作個「特寫」，十分靈活，但也只略具鬚眉，至于疏寫×人的兇殘，太原的漬退，新羣衆的興起，都同樣是許多側面，許多「瑣細」。然而那些都不是偶然的現象，却用以透露那必然，作者走進破碎支離的晉局，他不驚疑，他終于看見中國的新生，勝利的必然！他在深山中，在農村裏，發現了羣衆和羣衆的軍隊，他溫暖地和他們在一起，他因而感到侵略者將必粉碎和失敗」！他吧心中所有的溫熱，寫了下來，同時他還不客氣地把「老中國」的癥結褐露，于是使我們強烈地感動振奮，確信而願意擴大那中國獲得的生機，他作者，這樣說：外人以爲中國已全在侵略者的手中，『而在見到這些民衆的超越的活力後，我對于他們最後的勝利，並沒有什麼疑惑。在目前戰爭的風浪和困境裏，不久將產生一個新的中國——個『截然不同』的新中國了。——作者現在是用他的心血把這向全世界宣吿。</p>
<p>他用生花妙筆，輕描一兩下，大大小小的羣衆戰士都成爲活着的了；他們都是堅决的擬形——這個抗爭的堅决普遍到每個人的心　時，×人便是遇到了一復興的中國的全力一而至粉碎！</p>
<p>……我們目的地的旅部，已在那天夜間移動了——沒有人知道準確的去處。我們的前途，會遇到危險。</p>
<p>「那麼我們怎樣辦呢？」</p>
<p>那排長聳聳他寬闊的肩膀，一向前進呵，遇見了自已的同志，自然可以找到旅長的。」他似乎毫不想到我們或許會先遇見日軍的事，</p>
<p>在辦事處的外面，我和我的隨身護兵話別，……「你豈不要和我一同到英國去嗎？我問他說，這是我們在閒談中常常說起的。</p>
<p>他照常露出了微笑，並且提起了他　垂的褲子反問說：「你歡喜帶我去嗎」？</p>
<p>「當眞的！」</p>
<p>他搔着耳朵，想了一刻，最後搖搖頭說：『我現在不能到英國去。』……『我並不怕，但是現在我們不得不保南華北，我們都是很需要的。每個人應當……』</p>
<p>這個不能不使作者感動，也使一切人感動，「老中國　已被代換了，民衆戰士生長了！</p>
<p>作者替我們粉碎日本誣我赤化的宣傳，他展開了邊區，統一陣綫的眞貌，他又以親麼的個人，向世界宣吿：「每一次戰事都有「慘酷的事　，在那些神志淸醒的西方國家，目前或許認爲祇是雙方的宣傳，不是事實，但是我不信處在伸坭了的鄉屋裏的山西平民，能理會到這些「機巧」。而×人兇殘的「故事」，是，這誠的悽慘的音節。</p>
<p>作者在瀋陽車室和中國腳夫的談話（見弟二個春天），透露了失地中的中國人的心。對「陰暗中的北平」，他看出了「希望」，預斷着獲得『新自信』的時機終會到來的。</p>
<p>在東京。他指出那瘋狂中的愛鬰和恐懼高呼萬歲的送出征，曾幾何時，已變成一最慘慘的　別一，一支像　歌般的無終送行曲，使兵士受不住了，　沒有樂隊，沒有旗幟，沒有歡呼……」</p>
<p>「一切都是欺人「，一朝日不昇了」，這是很美麗的結語。</p>
<p>秘密的中國一的著者，報吿文學大家，基希說過，報吿文事家一要和被壓迫者緊密地連　在一起努力，勃脫蘭氏和其他幾　國際友人都做到這樣了，我們應該感謝。</p>
<p>被壓迫者必將翻身！</p>

<h3 id="c45">銀行界的業餘團體　「銀聯」在發展中 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>前晚在孔聖堂熱烈舉行聯誼會</p>
<p>抗戰的炮聲和火燄改變了一切。瞧吧：一八一三　以前，全香港的華籍銀行從業員共有一千三百人。「八一三」以後直到現在，一來就增加了一倍。全香港的華籍銀行從業員的人數足足有二千六百人以上了。這，就是因爲上海漢口的金融中心移到香港來，銀行和銀號已經在四十家以上。外來的中心集團不消說就是「中中交」幾家。</p>
<p>「量」在增加，「質」亦在改變。是給誰迫來到香港？血一般的教訓誰亦不會忘記的。囘憶可愛的家鄉被蹂躪於×騎之下，瞻望烽姻漫天的祖國，在這裏托人之蔭。×××××××××？因此，銀行界警覺的朋友，優秀的份子，嚴肅地組織起來；香港銀行業業餘聯誼會——簡稱「銀聯」——就在今年一月廿二日誕生了。</p>
<p>消極的目的，不消說是預防不至於「久而不聞其臭」，而在這「安樂窩」醉生夢死下去。積極的目的，就以『聯絡感情，交換學識，改善業餘生活，提倡正當娛樂，增進服務效能，促進銀行業務』爲宗旨。</p>
<p>該會的組織，會員大會之下，設理事會，監事會。常務理事會之下，分：</p>
<p>總務，會員，學術，服務，體育，娛樂，出版等部，嚴密的分工合作，部之下還分出很多股和很多組。</p>
<p>該會活動的範圍很廣泛，如圖書館，歌詠隊，話劇團，演講會，銀行會計班，英文班，旅行，各種體育訓練及各種愛國運動等等，揚棄「養尊處優」的習慣，在集體中生活，在集體中學習，表現了卓著的成績。</p>
<p>該會會員增加至現在已經九百來人了，永久會員會費一次繳納港幣五十元以上，贊助會員會費每月繳納一元以上十元以下，普通會員每月繳納三角。所以，該會的經濟基礎，是相當穩固的。銀行界巨子如錢新之，唐壽民，葉琢堂，俞鴻鈞，孔令侃，劉吉生，李道南，霍材寶，李楠公等，不是參加爲該會永久會員，就是充分表示同情，畫力予以　助。上層與中下層互相結解地統一起來，該會在這一點上是做得很好的。該會的負責幹部，亦有很多原來就是在銀行界負責重要的職務。</p>
<p>事實告訴我們：有很多職業界領袖心地還是狹窄的，眼光還是短小的，不滿意於部屬參加社會活動或業餘活動，因此很多職業靑年顧忌着，徬徨着。據該會負責人語記者，「銀聯」可就沒有這不幸的事實發生。這是堪以吿慰的。</p>
<p>該會以會員人數日增，爲發展會務便利計，新近又在孖沙街十四號金銀貿易場參樓建立了堂皇的會所，經於本月六日舉行開幕禮，極一時之盛。爲聯絡感情，增進會員的團結起見，該會又於前晚在孔聖堂舉行第一次全體會員聯誼大會，上下樓全吿滿座，將及千人，多是銀行界從業員及其家屬，會場空氣十分快樂，十分熱鬧。該會的幹部如：王九成，馮樹敏，金仲陶，陳職鸞，汪叔查，陳斌，斐醒伯等，籌備大會一切，都是忙個不了。</p>
<p>過了七時，儀式開始了。主席馮樹敏致詞，接着就是游藝。口琴作爲前奏，還有該會歌詠團歌詠救亡歌曲。</p>
<p>「歸不得故鄉」『旗正飄　』『八百壯士』感動了觀衆，在『再來一次』的要求之下，再重歌一遍，博得了熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>接下去就是話劇，由該會銀聯劇團表演『古城的怒吼』及「泰山鴻毛」二名劇，由中旅團長唐槐秋氏導演，中旅很多朋友帮忙裝置，演出成續頗有可觀，直至午夜，始盡歡而散。該會銀聯劇團還擬於下月初假娛樂戲院義演，屆時，必有一番熱鬧。該會在環境的可能下積極求發展的精神是令人十分感佩的。</p>
<p>記者謹於文末，希望職業界從業員把握着此時此地的時機與環境，好好地幹下去。祖國在新生中，我們的一切亦要隨着新生啊！</p>

<p>— 丁瑩</p>
<p>—報珍貴的體育史—</p>
<p>雅典</p>
<p>雅典的教育、也是尚武的。但沒有像斯巴達趨於極端、因後者住在山陵縱橫的地方、所以性質就十分拗執頑強、前者估據希臘極東的門戶、交通便利、商務繁盛的所在、自然有文學的修養、昔樂的趣味、社會的享樂了、當紀元前六世紀、雅典也出了一個偉人名叫Salon他看了各處山陵平原海岸不同的住民、常常起不少的糾紛、所以也特地規定一種憲法來</p>
<p>（一）兒童的教育、兒童出世、就托乳母撫養、也要受國家的檢查、唯棄捨之權則換於父母底手裏、六歲以前都在母親膝下過生活、　戲的方法、已綀習得變化多端、現在還可以發見他們傳下來的遺跡、讀書、算術、音樂、體操同時並重、因雅典底教育法是以個人的完成興調和爲目的的、學校教育不過私人的義務罷了、國民教育要達到如何程度、依家庭之貧富與父親之意志而决定、然負直接教育的責任者、也是奴隸身分的師傳、這親師傳、多是失敗的亡命客、性格是不問的、報酬也沒有一定的、據憲法中規定、七歲則入相撲學校、練習體操音樂以及舞蹈、爲準備祭神前供物時祭禮用的、十八歲以後音樂的練習就停止、惟體操仍舊繼續的進行、體操的着眼點雖在國防、但也注意到平衡的發育、因Salon的立法、以音樂是發揚精神、體操是發達身體的、所以體操之外特別着重香樂、因此、後世稱斯巴達爲尚武教育、將雅典爲尚文教員、其實、雅典何嘗不尚武呢、只是沒有如斯巴達的極端罷了、</p>
<p>（二）教育所、希臘的教育所、卽是體操場、所以我們也可以說、希臘的教育就是體育、當初也沒有完備的體育場、無非棟選着單純質樸的市場和海岸、其後就注意體育的建設、少年角力及拳鬥的地方、叫作Palaestra、成人的叫作Gymnosia今將Platon關於Gymnoia的建築、語明其大略Gymnasia爲靑年的體操場、內有蒸氣浴、任人出入、有更衣室、呌作Apoduterion運動開始時的塗油呌作Claiothe、用沙　擦處叫作Konisterion球戲場叫作Sphairlsterion、角力場叫作Xusioi總之，希臘的Gymnasia是十八歲以上的青年和成人聚集社交處、其著名的如）Luksion　Geum　Kunassnges　AeademeRlolenaoion等處、均有Gymnasia的建築、因內有　堂、談話室、養老室、實爲雅典人的俱樂部、近世歐洲關於學校的語源多出於此、德國的高等學校叫作Gymnasimn法國的中學Lycee卽其一例、</p>

<p>爭辯處可當棒球規則的解釋　幽默處可供荼餘飯後的笑料</p>
<p>黃梅時節，雨水偏多，而又奶凑巧的每在公開棒球聯賽將到開演的時光，雨便傾盆而下、把打球人和看球者的興趣沸點，降到零度。</p>
<p>咋天兩場好戲，剛巧又遇雨，逼得停鑼；然而，球賽雖沒有舉行，可是場裏避雨的人們，却擠得水洩不通。戴了美國闊邊牧童　帽的「白鬚公」史蔑夫，跟穿上戎裝的香港會球員獲加，模敦，小史蔑夫，（南華西報棒球記者亦卽香港會二壘手）足棒球健將李安納，西洋會投手帕拉刺，南華會吳振邦等，羣集一隅，有說有笑</p>
<p>言談中，李安納把話柄移尚棒球規則方面去，並質問小史　夫，說他上星期六多記他『錯誤』一次。小史蔑夫囘答說「那天你有兩次錯誤，其中一次是你的對手擊一飛球時，你搶前而接，你手術不靈，球兒從你的手套，滑落地上，這是錯誤的」。李安納跟着駁說：「當時我在球兒落點十餘碼外，狂奔而去，還沒有立定的時候，就要伸手接球球兒觸着我的指尖，然後滑落地上，這不能算作錯誤的」。小史說：「那球明明從你的掌心跌出來，怎還不算錯誤？」</p>
<p>站在小史跟前的模敦，以手指刺着史蔑夫的胸瞠加插一句：「你的紀錄，時常不公平的，我也吃過你的苦頭了。」嬉皮笑臉的小史問道：「吃過怎麼苦？」模敦疾言厲色道：「前次我接一球，你竟然記上一次錯誤，你要知道錯誤的定義，是指延誤，漏接，和野球等；假若照理，球員不克在他的能力內盡他的職守時，不得算爲錯誤的、譬如有一擊球員，擊出一球、這球從三壘及游擊之間漏去、球員得機、佔取一壘、這是否錯誤？」小史從速地答道、「當然不是錯誤、眞是安打的」，模敦怒氣稍消、白鬚公祇有在旁　渠不置、不作左右袒、</p>
<p>吳振邦旋對記者說：捧議一道，是　類中最有興趣，而又最複雜之戲；球員不獨要有敏捷的身手，還要具有淸醒的頭腦，手快眼快，有勇有謀，方能做到成功的球員。比賽規例，雖然複雜難明，可是一經熟讀，懂得運用的時候，就會感覺到嚴密中而有與趣。醫如二人出局以前，第一和第二壘，或一二三壘，都被跑壘員佔據時，擊球員送出一容易爲內場員接得的飛球，裁判員一經宣佈『內場飛球』，無論球之被接與否，擊球員就算出局，此例保護進攻的一方面，免使游戲成爲單調，假使裁判員認爲非『內場飛球』時，則場員可互相傳球，施行「雙殺」或三殺的步臻』。老吳振又說，『敝隊投手李仲振乃是工程師，臼前接得重慶方面電邀，經已取道海防上任；由是南華隊又少一好手，可幸猛將鄭彪决意入伍從軍，本週末可現色相』。</p>
<p>天雨稍停，各人皆賦歸去。香港會捕手獲加，以幽默的口吻，裝着棒球場裏紀錄員的神態，大呼「No　Rur，No　Hit，No　Error」的口號，然後挽着将藍下山而去。僅得獲加以「無分無安打無錯誤」，寓意無球賽的人們，莫不開口大笑。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Past, Present, and Future of the War of Resistance in North China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Xichun</p>
<p>(1) A Historical Review of the Twenty-Two Months of the War of Resistance in North China—Its Experiences and Lessons</p>
<p>The War of Resistance in North China, especially in the Second War Zone which is the center of gravity of resistance in North China, over the past twenty-two months can be described in three stages, and its experiences and lessons can be explored.</p>
<p>A. The First Stage—From the "July 7th Incident" to the Fall of Taiyuan</p>
<p>1. Failure of Military Defensive Positional Warfare</p>
<p>The "July 7th Incident" was the beginning of a planned attempt by the × people to destroy our nation. Therefore, after capturing Tianjin and Beijing, they immediately advanced along the Ping-Sui Railway towards Nankou, attempting to seize Jin-Sui, the northwest gateway and national fortress. However, the military leaders in Jin-Sui had already developed detailed plans for the War of Resistance against Japan and had made appropriate deployments based on national defense works. Due to the emergency at Nankou and the inability of the Chahar troops to deploy in time, the Central Government ordered Tang's army stationed in Sui-Xi, along with Gao and Li's divisions, to be equipped with a mountain artillery regiment under Commander Zhou, and to deploy at Nankou with swift force, creating the fierce battle of Nankou. To reinforce Nankou and counterattack Beijing, Chen's division was first placed under Tang's command. At the same time, a certain group army was transferred from Shaanxi to provide reinforcements. To further facilitate operations in that area, Zhao and other units, attached with a certain artillery regiment, were ordered to attack northern Chahar, successively capturing Shangdu, Jiabosi, Shangyi, and other places. The bitter fighting at Nankou lasted for weeks, with the × repeatedly sending reinforcements, flanking on the right wing, and attacking fiercely. Upon Central Government orders, a certain unit in the mountainous area northwest of Zhuozhou was sent north as reinforcement, and General Commander Fu was ordered to lead his troops to reinforce the front of Nankou. Army Commander Tang heroically commanded, inflicting heavy damage on the ×. However, the army divisions under his command suffered great sacrifices. Ultimately, due to the reinforcements from northern Shaanxi not arriving in time, the Chahar defense forces retreated, Zhangbei fell, and Zhangjiakou was in crisis. The rear of our army was cut off by the ×, and the various armies resisting at Nankou had to retreat southwestward, causing the plan to counterattack Beijing to fail. Our × divisions suffered heavy losses. The × took advantage of the situation to fiercely attack Tian Suo, advancing towards Datong. As the majority of the × forces were isolated in southern Chahar, it was necessary to add the forces equipped for national defense advocated by Army Commander Wang to the Battle of Datong. As a result, the national defense works in eastern Sui and northern Yan were rendered useless. When it was decided to engage in a decisive battle with the × at Datong, the defense forces of Chahar successively abandoned Yuxian and Yangyuan. The × Itagaki Division was able to drive straight in from the Huailai area, eyeing Lingguang and attacking Yanmen. Therefore, the plan for a decisive battle at Datong could not be realized.</p>
<p>Next were the various battles in northern Jin. The ×, with hundreds of thousands of elite troops from the Itagaki and Tojo units, advanced in multiple directions. Our army also launched an attack on the × advancing from Lingguang, attempting to first defeat one route in the mountainous area outside Pingxingguan and then transfer forces to gradually annihilate them. Sun and Gao's units were ordered to firmly defend the line at Pingxingguan, while Chen and Guo's units launched an attack from near Tuanchengkou. However, when the attacking troops arrived, the key point of Tuanchengkou had already been occupied by the ×, who were launching a large-scale invasion, leading to an unsuccessful attack that turned into a blocking action. After nine days of bloody fighting, the hills near Pingxingguan were lost and regained nine times, seven times by the Jin-Sui army and once each by Gao's army and a certain route army. The × repeatedly sent reinforcements, but were repelled, and many × were annihilated. In particular, a certain brigade of a certain route army ambushed the ×'s logistics base and marching column near Xiaosai Village outside Pingxingguan, capturing a great deal of supplies. Other units suffered significant losses against several times their superior numbers. At that time, our army, with ×× divisions and × artillery regiments, assumed responsibility for a front line of five hundred li. Although the × ultimately failed to break through the Yanmen Highway, they concentrated their forces to attack Ru Yuekou. Our Brigade Commander Liang Jiantang led his troops in a bitter fight, ultimately sacrificing himself. The × then occupied the Fen Shui Ling and Tie Jiao Ling north of Fanshi.</p>
<p>After the × invaded Fanshi from Tie Jiao Ling, they advanced south along the Tongpu Railway. Our side concentrated a large army and ordered Army Commander Wang, attached with artillery ×× regiments, to defend the county seat, and Brigade Commander Shan Yuzhen, attached with artillery × battalions, to defend Yuanping. Army Commander Wang fought bitterly for seven days, suffering great losses. Brigade Commander Shan personally led his troops, fighting bravely with a single brigade against tens of thousands of × in a bloody battle. After the city fell, they continued with street fighting. Finally, they held three courtyards for eleven days, with nearly all officers and soldiers sacrificing themselves. Brigade Commander Shan also achieved success and benevolence. The bloody battles of Yuanping and × County allowed our army to calmly deploy at Xinkou, creating an unprecedented "annihilation of the ×." Generals Wei ××, Yang ××, Chuan ××, Hao ××, Li ××, Gao ××, Liu ××, Wang ××, Guo ××, Sun ××, Chen ××, and others led various armies, divisions, and brigades, attached with seven artillery regiments under Zhou's command, under the unified command of former General Commander Wei ×. The Commander-in-Chief planned meticulously and supervised the battle strictly. General Commander Chuan led several divisions of the Jin-Sui army in a frontal attack, fighting fiercely and achieving repeated victories. The enemy's army was thwarted, shaking the × nation. They repeatedly sent reinforcements, attempting to succeed, fighting bloodily for twenty-three days. Finally, the field battle turned into a positional battle, with the use of tunnels to attack us, and we also used tunnels to defend. More than 30,000 × were killed. Army Commander Hao Mengling and Division Commander Liu Jiaqi, and Brigade Commander Qingting, in order to block the breach of Nanhuaikou, took the lead and all sacrificed themselves for the country. On the left wing, Li Ming's two units launched a flank attack on the ×, advancing and retreating more than twenty li. General Commander Zhu Peng and Vice Commander led troops to cut off the ×'s rear and block their transportation. At that time, all the × were likely to be completely surrounded and annihilated by us. Unexpectedly, the military on the Pinghan Line retreated south of Shijiazhuang, and the Eastern Route × Army advanced on Niangziguan, broke through Gukuan, and gradually invaded westward. Our army at Xinkou could not move south and used the inherent fortifications near Taiyuan for a battle near the city, beginning the Battle of Taiyuan. The planned deployment was to have a portion defend the city and place the main force on the high ground on both sides of the railway to quickly annihilate the ×. However, the Eastern Route × invaded Yuchi Taiyuan again from Pindingshouyang, and the various units originally scheduled to assist in the defense of Taiyuan did not have time to return due to their participation in the Battle of Xinkou. The × had already pressed fiercely under the city of Taiyuan, causing the predetermined plan for Taiyuan to fail. In order to prevent the Eastern Route × from invading south and cutting off our rear transportation, our army gradually withdrew from Taiyuan and transferred to the southwest area. Taiyuan fell on November 8.</p>
<p>2. Initiation and Development of Political and Popular Movement Work</p>
<p>At the start of the war, the commander of the war zone said: "This war against Japan is not a war between countries, nor a war between people and nations, but a people's revolutionary war between a weak country and a strong country. We must implement a total mobilization of the people to respond to the war." Therefore, after the start of the war, the × War Zone actively deployed troops to strongly resist the war and began the total mobilization of the people in political, economic, and popular movements.</p>
<p>(1) Reforming the Administrative Structure to Meet Needs: During the Battle of Xinkou, the entire province was divided into seven guerrilla administrative regions, each with a political director to guide and connect various counties to accelerate mobilization work and strengthen administrative efficiency. After the × penetrated deeply, the counties lost contact with the provincial government and were able to act on behalf of the provincial government, maintaining the government in the ×'s rear. At the same time, more than seventy county magistrates were replaced, and brave and responsible individuals were selected to fill the positions.</p>
<p>(2) Determining Wartime Financial Policy: Based on the principle of "those with money contribute money, and everyone contributes effort," the method of reasonable burdens on counties and villages during the War of Resistance was announced to improve people's lives and enrich the strength of the War of Resistance. To break the ×'s deceptive trick of exempting grain and taxes, the exemption of various local taxes was announced to reduce the people's burdens.</p>
<p>(3) Intensifying the Organization and Training of the People: At the start of the War of Resistance, total mobilization implementation committees were established at the provincial, county, and village levels to accelerate the mobilization of the people. After the fall of northern Yan, to adapt to the special circumstances of the battlefield, a general mobilization committee for the people's revolutionary war battlefield was established to implement battlefield mobilization. The work of the public moral corps and the Sacrifice League in various counties was also centered on mobilization. Therefore, various popular organizations such as farmers' rescue, youth rescue, workers' rescue, and women's rescue were established in various counties and villages.</p>
<p>(4) Expanding the Arming of the People: Before the war, there was already the establishment of a national soldiers' officers training corps, which selected more than 10,000 knowledgeable youths with patriotic consciousness from various villages for centralized training. The original plan was for two years to train the lower-level cadres of 300,000 armed people. Before the training was completed, the War of Resistance had already begun, and the students demanded to participate in the War of Resistance. They were gradually reorganized into the Youth Anti-Japanese Death Squad, and workers and peasants were absorbed to expand the organization and transform it into combat troops. More than a thousand workers from Taiyuan City volunteered to participate in the War of Resistance and formed a workers' armed self-defense force. At the same time, the organizational methods for the people's armed self-defense forces in various counties and the village self-defense forces that did not separate from production were announced, and local armed forces in various counties developed rapidly.</p>
<p>(5) Determining the Ten Major Programs of National Revolution: During this period, the war gradually deepened, and the work gradually developed. To determine the goals and take further steps, the Ten Major Programs of National Revolution were determined, which greatly helped the work of the War of Resistance. Schools for training young people for people's revolution and political and military schools attached to the army were established to absorb young people from various places and cultivate military and political cadres.</p>
<p>B. The Second Stage—From the Linfen Hot Springs Conference to the Jixian Senior Generals Conference.</p>
<p>1. Development of Military Mobile Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>After the fall of Taiyuan, the military center of gravity shifted to the Jinpu Line. At the same time, the troops of this war zone contained the × on both sides and in the rear, preventing the × from immediately advancing into southern Jin, forming a state of confrontation between the × and us on the Hanhouling Line, giving us an opportunity to rest, reorganize, and deploy.</p>
<p>During this period, the military and political leadership organs were concentrated in Linfen. To implement the purpose of the War of Resistance and adapt to the future situation, the strategic decision of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare was made in military terms, and its implementation was actively prepared. In political terms, the principles of unified understanding, unified guidance, and unified action were decided by the Hot Springs Conference.</p>
<p>As soon as the meeting was over, in military terms, to coordinate with the operations on the Jinpu Line, our army launched a counterattack on Taiyuan from the left and right wings. Guerrilla units in various places also assisted the regular army in combat by attacking the ×, destroying transportation, and detecting × intelligence. However, because the right wing moved slowly for seven or eight days, giving the × an opportunity to concentrate their forces and attack our material storage area in the Lüliang Mountains, taking advantage of our emptiness, a certain army and a certain division of the vanguard, led by General Commander Chuan, had already advanced in and out of Taiyuan and were in fierce battle with the ×, making it difficult to transfer them back in time. Therefore, the general reserve force of the Wang army had to be hurriedly deployed to block the ×'s advance, fighting bitterly for weeks, making great sacrifices, and Brigade Commander Zhao Xizhang sacrificed himself. Chen's army, which was stationed in the Linfen area, was urgently transferred to provide reinforcements overnight. At this time, the First War Zone abandoned Xinxiang, and the Eastern Route × Army drove straight in from Dongyangguan, Yuanqu, and other places, cutting off our rear communication lines in a few days, and the situation was extremely urgent. The key passes of Dui Jiugu and Da Maijiao on the western route were successively broken through by the ×, and the entire counterattack plan could not be realized. Therefore, the strategy was changed, and our armies were withdrawn to various places in the entire territory to launch a full-scale guerrilla war, dividing the entire war zone into four routes: east, west, south, and north, each with a commander-in-chief responsible for commanding, deeply into the rear of the × to lay the foundation for the guerrilla base areas.</p>
<p>In mid-March, the ×, with more than ten thousand troops, surrounded and attacked Jixian from eight directions. At the same time, three routes surrounded the northwest, and in April, nine routes jointly attacked Qin County, all of which were repelled by our army.</p>
<p>In mid-April, to coordinate with the operations in Chuzhou, the Southern Route Army attacked the ×, recovering the triangular area. The Western Route Army counterattacked Zhongyang, Lishi, and Pu counties. The Northern Route Army recovered Qingshuihe and advanced towards Suiyuan and Mongolia. The Eastern Route Army attacked Zhengtai County, attracting a large number of × troops to achieve the task of containing the ×.</p>
<p>Also, within one to three days, the various detachments of our Border Region Government and Nie Rongzhen's troops successively recovered nine counties, including Buping, Lingguang, Xingtang, and Quyang. On the 5th, they recovered Changping, and on the 6th, they occupied Yangyuan.</p>
<p>2. Development and Progress of Political and Popular Movement Work</p>
<p>Due to the decisions and promotion of the Hot Springs Conference, the development of political and popular movement work in this stage has the following progress:</p>
<p>(1) Soundness of Political Institutions: Before the retreat from Linfen, to protect the local area, each political district set up a security commander's office and established a security team. When Linfen retreated, the provincial government ordered that the people's armed self-defense forces and public security bureau police in various counties should be organized into guerrilla detachments, with the county magistrate serving as the detachment leader. This is the soundness of the security organization. The political districts were changed to administrative districts, and the political directors were changed to administrative inspector commissioners. In the center of Yangqu Xiangning, eight or nine districts were set up. This is the soundness of the administrative organization. The establishment of a civil revolution room to promote civil revolution education, strengthen supervision, and establish a civil revolution middle school and revolutionary primary schools in various counties. This is a sound administrative facility.</p>
<p>(2) Development of Popular Movement Work: The important work in the popular movement is to mobilize new soldiers to replenish the regular army, expand the new army, support the mobilization of the people, consolidate political power, carry out rescue work in the district, and crush the × puppet organization. Further strengthen popular organizations such as farmers' rescue, women's rescue, children's rescue, and youth rescue to protect the interests of the people and expand the strength of the war zone.</p>
<p>C. The Third Stage—From the Senior Generals Conference in × County to the Present</p>
<p>1. Strengthening the Quality of the Army and Giving Play to the Effectiveness of the Civil Revolutionary War</p>
<p>At the senior generals conference convened on July 1 in a certain village in × County, our commander-in-chief pointed out: To succeed in resisting ×, we must first seek the existence of the army itself. To exist, we must change from weak to strong; to succeed, we must overcome the strong with the weak. In order to achieve "changing from weak to strong," new replenishment methods, new rule, and new training methods were prescribed in order to integrate officers and soldiers, and integrate the military and the people. In order to achieve "overcoming the strong with the weak," new combat methods were prescribed in order to operate with flexibility, kill the ×, and protect the people under the principle of not losing opportunities and not suffering losses.</p>
<p>After the meeting, in order to thoroughly promote the "Four New Educations," incumbent military officers were batch-called for training, and the "Four New Educations" were promoted with full force in the army. Deadlines were set for each to be achieved on time. Since the implementation, each unit has made extraordinary progress, thus greatly increasing its effectiveness in combat:</p>
<p>In early September, × reinforced Lishi and invaded Dawu to the north, and attacked Liulin to the west. In October, five routes invaded the Wutai District. Then they jointly attacked Ningwu in northwestern Shanxi and jointly attacked Heshun and Liaoxian in eastern Shanxi. All were cleverly commanded by our frontal armies in heroic battles. The new tactic of "soft front and hard side" was used to lure the × deep and then annihilate them, and the political power of military, government, and people cooperation and empty room clearance was used to transmit intelligence and use it appropriately to give them heavy blows. In particular, in the battle of Liulin Dawu, more than 2,000 × were annihilated, and the × regiment leader Ishida was also killed in the battle. Dawu Liulin was immediately recovered.</p>
<p>In order to fully achieve the requirements of the new political strategy of the civil revolutionary war, Xu's brigade of a certain division advanced into the Fen-Nan Jihuang Mountains, threatening the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, and at the same time consolidating our Fen-Nan regime. The brigade used new guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, combined with clever fortifications, and defeated the ×'s three siege attacks on October 1. In particular, on November 5, the ×, in order to attack Xiangji and eliminate future troubles, launched a large-scale siege with about 4,000 infantry and more than 20 artillery pieces. After a fierce battle, it was broken, causing the × to suffer hundreds of casualties without gaining anything. A certain × artillery colonel also died in the battle. However, when our brigade commander Xu Jizhang personally directed the battle in Jixi Village, he was unfortunately killed by artillery shells. It is a pity, but our army's use of civil revolutionary tactics is undoubtedly enough to defeat the ×.</p>
<p>In late December, the × army, about 20,000, launched a nine-way siege of Jixian from the northeast, east, and southeast, approaching the Yellow River, attempting to cross to the west. In order to implement the ethnic revolutionary war method, the empty room clearance military and political cooperation operations were conducted, and the × was lured into the river bank, and then the rear was cut off, the food and grass were trapped, and the × were ambushed everywhere. In order to properly use the new tactics to annihilate the ×, a certain commander personally commanded the army in the heavy encirclement, relying on the assistance of the people and the dedication of the officers and soldiers, and broke the ×'s siege in less than ten days. The × who retreated eastward on the Lin-Da Highway (Linfen to Daning) were killed even more. However, because each unit had just finished training, the application was not very flexible, but more than half of the × were still annihilated. This shows that the ethnic revolutionary tactics can break the ×'s purpose of using force and kill the × effectively. In the battles of Wutai, Heshun, and Liaoxian, the × also broadcast that they were subject to our people's empty room clearance system, and it was difficult to even drink water. According to the central statistics, there were a total of 362 battles in the country in the second half of February, and the total number of × casualties was more than 20,000. The battles in Shanxi accounted for about four-sevenths, with 202 battles, and more than 10,000 × casualties, accounting for one-half of the country. Our × casualty ratio. I am one, × is thirteen weaker, and it is more iron evidence that the ethnic revolutionary tactics are enough to control the ×'s death.</p>
<p>D. Experience and Lessons of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The above three stages of the history of the War of Resistance. In the military aspect, the first stage was a defensive positional war. Our army held a line, resisted section by section, to achieve the purpose of attrition warfare, but this gave the × the opportunity to exert their superior weapons, causing us great losses. In the second stage, the strategic use of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare made the war situation gradually favorable, and preliminary guerrilla base areas were established, forming a state of stalemate between the × and us, containing the ×'s offensive. The third stage was the strengthening of the quality of the army and the development of the ethnic revolutionary life-threatening tactics. The various battles to crush the ×'s offensive attempts all showed the great power of our military, government, and people. In the political and popular movement mobilization organs, all began to be established, laying the foundation for the people's revolutionary war. The second stage was the development period of the War of Resistance's political and popular movement work. The political organization gradually sound. The × district's regime gradually recovered, and the political effect became increasingly large. In terms of popular movement, the progress of the organization and training of the people enabled the people to show considerable achievements in helping the army fight, eliminating traitors, and assisting the mobilization of new soldiers. The third stage was the sound period of the War of Resistance's political and popular movement work. Politically, strong people politics and administrative service were implemented. In terms of popular movement, the organization's strength was gradually strengthened by the perfection of the organizational system. Therefore, we clearly see:</p>
<p>1. The ethnic revolutionary war has the inevitability of progress. A weak country resists the aggression of a strong country. The wonderful use of ethnic revolutionary law cannot win the final victory.</p>
<p>2. In positional offensive and defensive warfare, our army suffered four times as many casualties as the ×, and consumed more ammunition and lost more firearms. It should be avoided as a failed tactic of fighting the strong with the weak. In mobile guerrilla warfare, the ×'s casualties were three times to six times to even three times weaker than ours. We consume less ammunition, and not only do we not lose firearms, but we also capture some. It is a successful tactic of defeating the strong with the weak and should be worked hard!</p>
<p>3. The establishment of the anti-Japanese regime and the implementation of politics suitable for the War of Resistance destroyed the expansion of the puppet regime, shattered the ×'s dream of domination, and implemented the goal of fighting against the Japanese invaders, laying the foundation for victory and revival. Efforts should be made to sound and promote it.</p>
<p>4. Establish anti-Japanese guerrilla base areas and use the combined military, government, and people's force to fight against the ×. Although the × used superior forces, they ultimately failed. Without establishing an anti-Japanese war base area and fighting without contact between the military, government, and people, the ×, although inferior, and we, although superior, could not receive miraculous achievements, so establishing anti-Japanese guerrilla base areas and using the combined military, government, and people's force is the work that should be worked hard today.</p>
<p>5. The development of popular movement work can block the ×, shrink the × district, and complete the combined military, government, and people's force to attack the ×. However, organizing and training the people can use persuasive methods to gain the sympathy of the people, and the people can serve the anti-war work enthusiastically and disciplined. If a compulsory method is used, it is easy to provoke resentment. Therefore, popular movement work is a necessary means to win the war against ×, and the persuasive method is the highest principle of the popular movement work style and should be vigorously adopted.</p>
<p>6. The rise and fall of the people's anti-× sentiment is proportional to the number of times our army strikes the × and the amount of × damage. If we can constantly attack the × diligently, it will not only accumulate small victories into big victories and annihilate small × and weaken big ×, but also boost our people's anti-× sentiment, indirectly benefiting the people's mobilization work.</p>
<p>7. Our ethnic revolutionary tactics increase one point of function and reduce one point of the ×'s ambition to successfully invade China, and we must increase the ×'s anti-war and war-weary emotions by one point, so we must comprehensively and continuously occupy the active position, annihilate the inferior ×, attack the × in transit, harass the × while they are stopped, burn × supplies, and cut off × transportation, so that the × feel that the purpose of invading China cannot be achieved and the war of invading China cannot be quickly concluded. Their war-weariness and anti-war emotions continue to rise, and the invasion plan of their general staff will eventually turn into a bubble.</p>
<p>(2) The Current Situation of Stalemate Between × and Us in the War of Resistance in North China</p>
<p>Since the transfer of the battlefield from Linfen and the change of strategy, the implementation of mobile sports guerrilla warfare, the war situation of the First War Zone, which supports the center of gravity of the War of Resistance in North China, has shifted to a stalemate stage between × and us. This stalemate is not a buffer for the × to stop the offensive, but a continuous failure of the ×'s offensive. In terms of the number of troops, the total number of × troops in China is 32 divisions, and those frequently used in Shanxi are often more than 8 regiments. Recently, there has been a report of two more elite divisions being transferred and arriving in Taiyuan, which shows how actively the × are invading Shanxi. In terms of the number of battles and the number of × army deaths, according to central statistics, there were a total of 322 battles in the country in the second half of February, with a total number of more than 20,000 × casualties. In Shanxi, there were a total of 202 battles, with more than 10,000 × casualties. Since March, the battle statistics for only 13 days have again had 253 battles, which shows the intensity of the mountain battle and the decline of the ×'s offensive power.</p>
<p>Now the form of × me has indeed reached a stalemate stage. This confrontation is due to the decline in the operational capabilities of the × and the increase in our resistance forces. At the same time, the × are oppressing us, trying to expand the × puppet regime: we are also actively preparing to shrink the area and expel the dwarf thieves, 蒈 will explain the current situation of the confrontation between × and us from both military and political aspects:</p>
<p>A. Military Stalemate</p>
<p>The current situation of military stalemate between × and us can be divided into three aspects: troop deployment, combat power, and current combat situation:</p>
<p>1. In terms of troop deployment. The × troops currently in Shanxi have a total of ten and a half divisions, and most of their deployments are based on transportation lines and important cities. They are constantly transferred and defended to confuse our sight and hearing, and build bunkers on the railway lines to consolidate their strongholds and transportation and prevent us from destroying them. It is the arrangement of point-line occupation. The number of our troops is much superior to that of the ×. Their arrangement is that the regular army is distributed in the northeast, northwest, southeast, and west of the anti-war base according to 地 and forms an encirclement around the ×. The guerrillas and self-defense forces penetrate into the occupied area of × and enter and exit the heart of ×. It is the area occupied and the cone-shaped突入 arrangement.</p>
<p>2. In terms of combat power. The actual situation of the army of the invading country has the inevitability of退步 under the situation of lasting time, while the revolutionary army has the inevitability of progress, so the combat power of the × has indeed declined now, and our combat power has indeed increased. The expression of fact. One is that the proportion of casualties in combat is gradually increasing, and the other is that the number of combat failures is gradually increasing. The reasons are as follows: First, in the mountain guerrilla war, the firepower of × is difficult to exert. Second, in the long-term anti-war war, after repeated setbacks, the spirit of the × has been exhausted. Third, the war-weary and anti-war sentiments of the × have increased sharply, and the will to fight has gradually weakened. Fourth, the strength of the × is insufficient to replenish, and most of its troops are mixed with Chinese people. These people are forced to be soldiers, so they have no will to fight and ability.</p>
<p>The above are all for the ×, and the ones on our side are as follows:</p>
<p>一1· The response to the invasion has激增 the ×× psychology of our soldiers and soared their enthusiasm. Second, the effect of strengthening the army's training has unified the understanding and thinking of all officers and soldiers, and gradually moved towards the path of collective action under the premise that the war of resistance is higher than everything else. Third, the promotion of the Four New Educations, by the new replenishment method and the new rule method, gradually strengthens the army from weak to strong, and by the new combat method, the army is gradually able to overcome the strong with the weak. Fourth, the forging of the war of fire has激增 the courage and skills of the soldiers in combat. Fifth, the development of the people's movement and the preliminary establishment of the guerrilla base have gradually made the military and the people one, and gradually completed the power that the × cannot invade.</p>
<p>3. In terms of the current situation of combat, judging from the actual battles, the × are currently attacking in many ways and actively oppressing us, showing the enthusiasm of the offensive. At the same time, they are rushing to build roads at the invaded locations, such as the recent bypassing of the 　Le and Shenchi automobile roads, which seems to have the intention of稳扎稳打, and also shows the determination of the offensive. But in fact, attacks in many ways and failures in many ways show that the企圆 cannot be achieved. And every time they attack, their lower-level officers and soldiers only seek to reach the attack location, but do not seek to expand the results of the war and complete the mission of occupation, fully showing the敷衍 state of 士无斗志.</p>
<p>Our side is using mobile combat methods to continuously attack the × in order to seize the strategic initiative, and use the military, government, and people's combined forces to establish an anti-Japanese guerrilla base area that the × cannot invade, and realize　 room clearance to crush the ×'s offensive purpose, and gradually promote it to shrink the × area and achieve the purpose of annihilating the ×.</p>
<p>B. Political Stalemate</p>
<p>The most difficult point for the Japanese to invade China is the lack of political ruling power. Especially in the × war zone, the development of our political power in the past year has laid the foundation for the anti-Japanese regime in counties and villages and armed the people in counties and villages, making the political power of the × unable to reach the countryside, which further deepens the difficulties and不安 of the ×. Therefore, the × are trying to turn the tide of their ruling power and add a war to our改治 attack. We believe that the weakness of the × is where we aim to attack and can致 the death of the × and strengthen the speed of their collapse, so we actively strengthen the administrative function and develop the people's movement work to strengthen the political struggle. Therefore, the situation of confrontation between × and us in this war zone is more serious in political confrontation than in military affairs.</p>
<p>The current situation of political stalemate between × and us can be divided into two aspects:争取 the people and expanding the regime: First, in the aspect of 争取 the people, the × have about two means to 争取 our people: one is threat, and the other is怀来, the front section of the invasion. Killing, arson, rape, and looting are more threatening than怀柔. Now, because threats have aroused resentment, they are using the weakness of self-interest from our compatriots to deepen怀柔 by means of数骗利诱, and sometimes use threats to help怀柔. The × believe that our compatriots lack national consciousness. Giving them the hope of苟延 lives in a欺　 way will enable them to be slaughtered. There are those who do not accept怀柔. Even more so with the threat method, it can force endurance. How can you know that the怀柔 policy is originally contradictory to the act of invasion, so the expression of the facts,怀柔 is always a statement, always a hope. Not　 when using threats, exceeding the scope of threats. It becomes a kind of mutilation, and in the process of high　怀柔, the general facts of insult and trampling are still constantly occurring, because怀柔 is a kind of deception, and deception cannot last.</p>
<p>Our politics is standing on the position of democracy and freedom, standing on the position of protecting the safety and interests of the people, it is the politics of saving the country, the politics of strengthening the people and saving the people, organizing the people, is based on the requirements of the people's organization, and it is necessary to make the people understand the needs of the organization, our work has gradually embarked on the road of strengthening the people's politics and persuading administration, and has gradually awakened the people's觉怏, so that the people have the belief that the war of resistance will win, and each village has organized救亡 groups and self-defense forces, and the longer the time　长, the more progress will be made.</p>
<p>Second, in the aspect of expanding the regime. The 理势 of the × to expand the puppet regime is one for the expansion of the puppet organization and the other for strengthening the puppet administration. The former uses forced and trained means, and the number of traitors is gradually increasing, but the general traitors have no protection of rights and personality, not only are those who are forced into suffering, but they are all陷入悲观情　之中. The latter's performance is one for the strengthening of the east-bound politics, and its method is to strictly investigate household registration, restrict the freedom of our people, gradually compile自卫团 and皇协军, and implement the "policy of using China to制华." In order to implement the enslaved education, it is倒是非, deceptive　言论, 愚弈 our people, 眩　 international视听. One is to restrict the circulation of our laws to destroy our finances.</p>
<p>Although our anti-Japanese regime is expanding, it is also built with county and district administrative systems in places where the ×'s power is deep, and all of them are based on the spirit of democracy, starting from the lower level to establish the politics of public opinion, and in the administrative aspect.　 Use persuading administration to implement the politics of benefiting the people. At the same time,　取 and eliminate traitors to destroy the × puppet regime and disintegrate the × puppet organization. And actively strengthen the district and village administrative functions to prevent the expansion of the × puppet regime.</p>
<p>(3) The Future Trend of the War of Resistance in North China</p>
<p>The Japanese × invaded China, originally taking the gradualism of不战而胜, and since the July 7th Incident was strongly resisted by us, the threat policy. It cannot continue, and it is more loudly標榜 the intention of conquering China in three months in order to use the policy of a quick battle to make China yield. As soon as the war started, our country held on to the determination to resist to the end and continued to fight and resist strongly. With the continuation of time, the Japanese × felt the crisis that the national strength was insufficient to support the長作戰战, and the高　 sang the tune of conquering Wuhan, that is, it can end the war and subdue China, in order to stimulate its soldiers and　 the morale of its people. Who knows that since Wuhan has fallen, China can not only not yield, but its morale is stronger and its hearts are more enthusiastic. Therefore, the Japanese ×'s aggressive situation is deeply陷入膠着, unable to extricate itself.</p>
<p>In the future, what strategy will Japan use to break the current stranded situation, and judging from the current situation, it will not be able to進玫西北 southwest, or粛淸 the two ways of the occupied area. Originally, the purpose of armed invasion was to減亡 the pair</p>
<h3 id="e2">Continuing Fierce Battles in Western and Southern Shanxi; Stability in Hubei and Hunan, Intensified Warfare in Shandong and Henan; Guangxi Militia Elite Deploys Defensively on the Guangdong Border <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 11th] Military intelligence here indicates that the focus of the war remains in Shanxi. Fierce battles have continued in western Shanxi in recent days, and the situation in southern Shanxi is also becoming increasingly tense. However, the enemy's fierce attacks on all fronts are now being surrounded by our forces. We expect a decisive battle to occur within days. Our forces in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui continue to maintain their offensive advantage, and the overall situation is stable.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] According to news from the front lines in western Shanxi, although the Japanese army has captured several locations, their westward advance towards the Yellow River has not been successful. After the Japanese army fell into Lishi, Zhongyang, and Lilin, they advanced towards Junkou military crossing and Sanjiao along the Yellow River. The Japanese army attacked Junkou with a force of 7,000, but because their rear was threatened by the Chinese army, they could not redeploy their vanguard to assist the Japanese army in Liulin. Furthermore, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers attacked Pinglu. The Chinese army eliminated over two thousand enemy soldiers and withdrew from Pinglu after paying a significant price but are now counterattacking, approaching the city walls. According to a letter from Hubei province, the Japanese army in Qianjiang attempted to cross the Dongjing River but ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Bloody Battle on the Western Front</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Shilou, 11th] Since the large-scale westward invasion by the enemy in Zhongyang and Lishi, they have attempted to seize Nalin and Dabao, creating a threatening situation. Our units engaged in fierce battles along the Zheng'er-Shangxia Baishan-Shanjia line on the 1st and 3rd. On the 4th and 5th, fierce battles raged for two days and nights on the northern and southern mountains with more than 6,000 enemy soldiers who were surrounded. Although the enemy locked down each mountain pass with intense firepower and carried out continuous bombing raids with eleven aircraft, our troops became increasingly courageous. By dawn on the 6th, the enemy had suffered heavy casualties, with 600-700 killed. The enemy began to waver. We also suffered significant losses. Our officers above the regimental commander level repeatedly charged into the enemy lines, engaging in back-and-forth skirmishes. The enemy aircraft could no longer clearly identify targets and could not recklessly continue bombing, allowing us to defeat and repel them. Currently, we have shifted to an outer line of attack on their flanks and rear, establishing close communication with our right-wing units, and we are determined to inflict another serious blow on the enemy. In other news, fierce battles occurred near Liulin on the 5th, resulting in heavy enemy casualties.</p>
<p>[Also, Shilou, 11th] On the 4th, 50-60 enemy infantrymen, accompanied by two cannons, escorted more than ten large carts past Lijia Gou from Dawu when they were ambushed by our forces. It is estimated that the enemy artillery captain, Narita * and over forty others were killed, more than ten were injured, and several packhorses were lost. The remaining enemy soldiers fled in panic.</p>
<p>[Also, Xiangning, 11th] The enemy in the strongholds of Zhangdian, Anyi, Yuncheng, Wenxi, and Jiexian are once again showing signs of activity, attacking the mountain passes of Zhongtiao Mountain. Fierce battles have occurred in various locations in recent days. The enemy has suffered heavy casualties. On the 6th and 7th, intense artillery battles occurred at Ershili Ridge, destroying several enemy cannons.</p>
<p>Situation in Henan and Shandong</p>
<p>[Xiangning, 10th] The enemy in the Yongji area is largely concentrated in Fenglingdu, attempting to forcibly cross the Yellow River. Our troops are putting up a strong defense, resulting in bloody battles. It is reported that the enemy's Taniguchi division has been reduced by 2,500, and both the Inoue and Shibukawa regimental commanders have been killed in action. The enemy held a memorial service in Linfen on the 5th. Furthermore, the enemy near Linfen is busy with air defense and is digging large-scale air raid shelters in Yao Temple.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] According to reports, the enemy in Shandong has recently launched a large-scale offensive against us, advancing from the Jiaoji Railway to the south, from the Jinpu Railway to the east, and from Linyi to the north. Each force consists of 300, 500-600, and even up to 1,000 soldiers, attempting to attack our southeastern Shandong region. In recent days, our regular army units, in coordination with guerrillas, have intercepted the enemy on multiple routes, engaging in bloody battles with the enemy in northwestern Feixian Mengyin, and in southern and northern Linyi. The enemy has suffered extreme casualties, with bodies strewn all over the ground. The enemy's attempt has been crushed by us. As of the 10th, the fighting is continuing. At the same time, our guerrillas have attacked the Jinpu and Jiaoji railway lines, cutting off traffic at several points.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhumadian, 10th] A total of 2,000 enemy soldiers with over 20 large and small cannons from the outskirts of Taikang City. A portion of 300-400 soldiers attempted to raid Qingheyi on the 7th, but were routed by our forces. By the afternoon, the enemy retreated towards Taikang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiangyang, 10th] Several hundred enemy soldiers with four cannons, having infiltrated from Xinyang, shelled the villages of Wujia Dian on the 4th. On the 5th, 400 additional infantry and cavalry, with four cannons, arrived from Xinyang and fiercely attacked Fengjia Dian. After being met with resistance, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Xinyang. The remainder are being encircled and annihilated by our forces.</p>
<p>Situation in Southern China</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 11th] A certain agency here recently received military news from Shaoguan: (1) A portion of the enemy's army in Jiujiang has been harassing villages near the Jiang-Fo Road in recent days. They were attacked by our guerrillas, resulting in the deaths of thousands of enemy soldiers and the capture of many firearms. (2) On the 7th, over 600 enemy soldiers traveled in over ten cars and searched the areas near Guan Jun and Sanjiang. Our guerrillas intercepted them on all sides, and the enemy could not cope. (3) The enemy troops at Zhongluotan have retreated to Shengang. Approximately one thousand enemy soldiers are currently stationed in Shengang. On the 9th, a small unit of enemy infantry from Shengang went to Baigang for a change of guard. (4) After being attacked by us on the night of the 9th, the enemy at Zengcheng Gehe completely withdrew. There is no longer any trace of them in Fuhe. (5) There is currently one enemy warship near Linghai, but there is no movement.</p>
<p>[Also, Shaoguan, 11th] The situation in southern Guangdong is uncertain. The movements of enemy warships are erratic and mysterious, suggesting a significant enemy plot. In order to be prepared for any eventuality, the authorities have implemented temporary martial law in Gaozhou and Leizhou. All military deployments are properly prepared. Xia Wei, the commander-in-chief of the Sixteenth Army Group, to strengthen the defense of southern Guangdong, has sent the elite Guangxi troops led by Li * and Huang * into Guangdong and mobilized the soldiers and civilians under the jurisdiction of the Gao-Lei Special Defense Zone to be ready for battle. Furthermore, elite militia units from certain districts have been ordered to proceed to the border between Guangdong and Guangxi to establish defensive positions. If there is an alarm, they will immediately block and attack the enemy. The defenses of southern Guangdong are becoming increasingly fortified.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sihui, 10th] On the night of the 6th, a certain unit of our forces launched an attack east of *, completely destroying the newly repaired enemy highway. A portion of the enemy in Jiangmen rushed to attack, but our forces fought bravely and fiercely. The enemy abandoned 50-60 bodies and fled back to Jiangmen. Later, 700-800 enemy soldiers with three tanks launched a surprise attack on Jinzhu on the Jiang-Fo Road. However, after being fiercely attacked by us, a large number of enemy soldiers were killed and one enemy tank was destroyed. The remaining soldiers fled in different directions.</p>

<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>Special Contribution to this Newspaper</p>
<p>The enemy's recent actions in the northern Hubei area were within our expectations. I remember that when I met Mr. Li Delin in ×× a month ago, we made a very detailed analysis of the reasons for the enemy's invasion of the Hanshui River basin in mid-March, the comparison of the enemy and our forces, and the possible development of the war on this front in the future. Mr. Li Delin's estimations at that time have become the actual development of the enemy's recent military actions. Seeing the thoroughness of our army's deployment, the abundance of strength, and the enemy's concentrated use of the elite of four divisions to launch a fierce attack, the intensity of the war and the heavy casualties on both sides were within our expectations. However, looking at the enemy's propaganda, claiming to have surrounded dozens of our divisions today and annihilated hundreds of thousands of our troops tomorrow, it is like the storyteller in Xiangguan, exaggerating. Phrases such as "taking the head of a general from a million-strong army is as easy as taking something out of a pocket," and "the broadsword flies, killing people like cutting vegetables" are not only unbelievable but also make people laugh and feel overly comical.</p>
<p>On April 29th, the reporter arrived at ×× to visit the guerrilla cadre training class. Coincidentally, that day was the grand rally of all the teachers and students of the school to send off Dean Tang Enbo to the front line in central Hubei. The event was presided over by the directors of the training class, Bai Chongxi and Chen Cixiu. Liang Hancao, Zhou Enlai, Zhu Yusheng and others were also present. There were songs, plays, and Beijing opera - the atmosphere was very lively and the emotions were extremely high. Especially General Tang Enbo's speech before his departure was very exciting and moving, making me feel that he is not only a loyal and brave general, but also a contemporary genius with a profound understanding and cultivation of political and military strategies. Therefore, it is not a fortuitous coincidence that the recent battles between Sui and Zao counties have achieved results comparable to those of the Battle of Taierzhuang, which was due to objective reasons. In addition, I feel that Zhang Zizhong and his Chief of Staff Mr. Liu Jialuan are both figures who have progressed in the War of Resistance and developed in the struggle, and are highly trusted and loved by the soldiers. The troops who held back the enemy, cut off the enemy's retreat and fought fiercely on the ×××× highways were mostly under the command of Zhang Zizhong. On April 5th, I met with them in Jingmen, an important military town in central Hubei. Although the enemy was constantly firing artillery at the Shayang area on the west bank of the Hanshui River from Duobaowan, Luohansi and other places, pretending to cross the Hanshui River along the Hanyi Highway and take Yichang, General Zhang's headquarters had already begun to move north, crossing the river separately to deploy defenses in advance in the fan-shaped area between ××, ××× to take preemptive action. Because the enemy's strength on the east bank of the Hanshui River at that time was very weak, only two regiments of the Third Division. Comparing the current facts with the estimations at that time shows that the generals' judgment on the enemy's situation was accurate. Only by knowing yourself and knowing your enemy can you win every battle.</p>
<p>Xiangyang and Fancheng face each other across the Hanshui River and were military strongholds for the State of Wei to dominate the Central Plains during the Three Kingdoms period. Taking Xiangfan and then Nanyang to threaten Guanzhong is also an important strategic attempt of the enemy today, but the lack of their own strength and the many difficulties in the objective environment ultimately make the empty promises of the Japanese warlords a distress that is difficult to satisfy. I remember one night a month ago, when the bright moon was in the sky, shining on the quietly flowing headwaters of the Hanshui River, we were talking with General Li Zongren about the war situation. He believed that the enemy had mobilized a total of about fourteen divisions to the battlefields in China, which can be said to have reached the enemy's highest mobilization saturation. However, these thirty-odd divisions were scattered at various points in the country, just like stones thrown into the sea, and their effect was extremely weak. Taking the north and south banks of the Yangtze River as an example, except for a few important strongholds along the highway or along the river, most of the rest have been recovered by our guerrillas. Since it is impossible to hold on to the positions, it is naturally even more difficult to attack. In the four or five months since the withdrawal from Wuhan, the enemy has not been able to take any action. In this way, on the one hand, it will arouse the international community's doubts about the enemy's strength, and on the other hand, it is also afraid that political changes will take place at home, so it is difficult to advance or retreat, and it is only like a tired ox dragging a heavy cart deeper and deeper into the mire. The result is that they gain here but lose there, and the deeper they go, the more difficult it becomes. Finally, General Li Zongren also said very firmly: "Japanese imperialists will inevitably bring destruction upon themselves by committing many unrighteous acts, and will eventually follow in the footsteps of Germany's disastrous defeat in the European War of 1914."</p>
<p>The reporter's personal view is that the war in northern Hubei is still a kind of offensive defense war. On the one hand, it can be said that it is advancing towards Xiangfan in two ways, attempting to achieve the goal of annihilating the main force with an outer encirclement. On the other hand, it is also a defensive war to protect Wuhan and consolidate strongholds, because it is easier for the enemy to use Wuhan as a transportation center for transportation and supply. After the enemy captured Zhongxiang, Jingshan and other places in March, they built strong fortifications and left a small number of troops to guard these newly built military strongholds, and then divided their forces to assist the troops on the southern line in attacking Nanchang. Therefore, while the enemy is trying to attack Xiangfan, we will never neglect that the enemy's shameless broadcasting machine in Changsha has been barking wildly there, saying that they will take Nanchang in March and Changsha in April. Now the facts tell us that this ridiculous exaggeration has been shattered by the great spirit of our heroic soldiers.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai News: British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Phillips, today lodged a written protest with the Enemy Consulate regarding the Linchang Factory and Mr. Ding Keler's death, demanding the Enemy side promptly stop the anti-British movement, and specifically stated the following:</p>
<p>(1) Anti-British thugs active near the Linchang Factory should be immediately driven away;</p>
<p>(2) The Enemy side should assign personnel to protect workers of all nationalities residing in the Linchang Factory;</p>
<p>(3) Anti-British thugs near the Linchang Factory's Pudong printing factory should be severely punished;</p>
<p>(4) The anti-British movement in the Pudong area should be stopped immediately;</p>
<p>(5) All anti-British demonstrations and parades in Pudong should be disbanded;</p>
<p>(6) Posting of anti-British slogans should be prohibited;</p>
<p>(7) The Great People's Association, the center of the anti-British movement, should be disbanded;</p>
<p>The British protest repeatedly explained the circumstances under which the Linchang Factory was forced to cease operations due to the impact of the anti-British movement, and that the Enemy-controlled Xin Shenbao published anti-British text on the 7th of this month, which led to the assault on British expatriates. Mr. Ding Keler was killed on that day. Finally, the British Consul-General stated that the British side will also ban anti-Enemy movements within the Public Concession.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] At around 7:00 PM on the 11th, 27 Enemy aircraft raided Chongqing. When the Enemy aircraft approached Chongqing airspace, they encountered our Air Force in a fierce battle. Immediately after penetrating the city airspace, our high-altitude units launched a fierce bombardment. The Enemy aircraft, not daring to linger, hastily dropped their bombs and fled. Our aircraft immediately followed in pursuit, safely returning to base only after reaching a certain location. According to eyewitnesses, two Enemy aircraft were shot down by our forces, but the wreckage is still being searched for.</p>

<p>[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 11th] Over 180 puppet troops stationed in Jincheng Fort, Linfen, led by their platoon leader, Yang, killed the troupe leader who willingly served the enemy on the night of the 5th, and then defected with all their equipment, surrendering to a certain unit of our forces. The local people were overjoyed at the news and sent wine, meat, paper, cigarettes, etc. to express their respect. Platoon Leader Yang then made a passionate speech in public, filled with emotion and tears. He has now been incorporated into a certain unit to await orders to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 11th] After the defection of the puppet army in southern Linfen, the various towns of Yishi, Wanquan, and Ronghe are now under our army's control. The enemy can only be besieged in the dead cities, not daring to step outside. The enemy forces in the area of Hejin, learning from past mistakes, are highly suspicious of the local puppet army. Xia Qingan, the commander of the puppet army in Hejin, was lured to Dongquan by the enemy and killed. When the reporter was traveling from Hejin to Xikou, he found a human head on the electric pole when he was passing through Fangpo. There was a list for public display written in black on white cloth, listing the names of Pei Beihu and Ding Yinhai. These two were both puppet army commanders favored by the enemy in the past, but now they have both been beheaded. This serves as a warning to traitors.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Situation in the British Concession in Tianjin Deteriorates: The Enemy Actively Deploying a Blockade: The British Make Concessions but the Enemy Remains Dissatisfied <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 11th] The local Chinese Association here discussed the local situation last night and decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting a serious consideration of the current situation in Tianjin. According to authoritative sources, the British authorities have not received a final ultimatum from the Japanese side, but if certain circumstances are not intervened in, the British Concession will likely be blockaded on the 14th and 15th. At present, most of the Japanese-owned companies in the British Concession have already withdrawn.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] News from Tianjin indicates that the Japanese side will implement a blockade of the British Concession on the 14th, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. As a result, the patrol force in the British Concession has also suddenly increased. Furthermore, Yokohama Specie Bank officially announced today that it will officially cease business operations starting next week.</p>
<p>British Have Handed Over Criminals: The Enemy Remains Dissatisfied</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tianjin News: The British Concession authorities have handed over two suspects, Wang Qi and * * *, involved in the so-called bomb plot to the Enemy side. However, the Enemy believes that the two are not related to the assassination of Cheng Xigeng and remains dissatisfied, saying that the British side is not sincere. According to reports, the two were arrested earlier this month, both aged 21, and the case is not serious. None of the assassinations that have occurred in the past in Peiping and Tianjin have involved the use of bombs. General observation indicates that the British side is taking this compromise measure because our attitude is strong.</p>
<p>Our Side Negotiating with the British Side to Prevent the Handover of Chinese Citizens</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dianqing, 10th] Recent reports that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin, at the request of the Japanese side, handed over Chinese citizens within the Concession to the Japanese Consulate has aroused considerable attention from various parties. The reporter inquired about the situation with the diplomatic authorities. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the sake of the safety of our people in the British Concession in Tianjin, has repeatedly and solemnly negotiated with the British side to ensure proper protection. However, according to previous reports, some of the Chinese citizens detained in the Concession were about to be handed over by the Concession authorities to the Japanese side or puppet organizations. We have repeatedly negotiated with the British Embassy and instructed Ambassador Guo to request the British government to seriously consider this and order a stop to it. Recently, it was reported that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin received a final ultimatum from the Japanese side, demanding the handover of four people whom the Japanese side considered to be related to the assassination of Cheng Xigeng within a specified time limit. The British government has decided to telegraph the Concession authorities to extradite the aforementioned two people. Our side has again repeatedly made serious representations to the British Embassy and telegraphed Ambassador E to the British government, explaining that our side attaches great importance to this matter and urging it to reject the Japanese side's demands.</p>

<p>Border Region Government</p>
<p>The largest independent region in China is located in the vast mountainous region west of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, comprising parts of the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Hebei, forming a tight alliance. It has a population of 14 million. The region once included the entire central Hebei area. In the early days of the Japanese invasion in 1937, most of the local governments were destroyed. In the period after the Japanese troops retreated or passed through, administration fell into complete chaos. In early 1938, representatives from various regions that had not been directly occupied by the Japanese troops held a meeting in Tang County, a small town near the border with Shanxi west of Baoding, and organized what they called a district government, taking over the administrative power of the areas that were still independent. This was a mobile government, acting according to the policy of responding to the frequent incursions of the Japanese troops. After about half a year of war, the government was able to consolidate its position and gradually restore order in the counties. Last November, a large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived in North China, and launched a large-scale offensive from east to west, that is, from the Peiping-Hankou Railway and the Dongpu Railway, in order to suppress central Hebei. After repeated battles lasting about five months, the Japanese troops finally captured the towns and cities on the south bank of the Yellow River that were about halfway through. However, after discovering the pattern of advancing and then retreating after their offensives, they did not achieve satisfactory results and decided to change their strategy and began to station troops in larger towns and cities in central Hebei. As a result, about 50,000 reinforcements continued to arrive in North China in March and April, flooding into an even larger area. However, due to the vastness of the land and the scarcity of troops, there were still not enough troops to allocate, so even with reinforcements, it cannot be said that central Hebei has been effectively occupied.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>The guerrillas still hold on to the countryside, hiding in the vast plains in hundreds of villages scattered like stars. Before leaving, the guerrillas had demolished the walls of most of the towns and cities, so the Japanese troops could only defend themselves behind barbed wire obstacles, and appeared unstable. In the surrounding areas, they had no power to speak of. Even if the Japanese troops had occupied a city, they had no control over the countryside. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find someone to carry out any kind of local administration. When the Japanese troops approach a city, the people are ordered to leave, and only the local ruffians remain, working under the direction of the Japanese troops. This is a dangerous and difficult job, as they are captured and executed by the guerrillas. The farmers in the surrounding areas no longer bring agricultural products into the now desolate cities, so the Japanese troops have to transport all their supplies from the nearest railway stations. The guerrillas dig ditches six feet deep across the roads, which greatly hinders truck transport. The supply of raw cotton, which was one of the purposes of the Japanese invasion of North China, has also become a pipe dream. The former guerrillas have been urging farmers not to grow cotton anymore, leading to a reduction of about 80% in the amount of cotton. According to the current policy, it is difficult to understand how the Japanese troops can hope to establish an effective administrative organ, to manage affairs in the entire North China region, and to restore peace and order in the interior. The actions previously taken by the Japanese troops, and still continuing to be taken in the invasion of other parts of the interior, to destroy villages and blame the guerrillas, can only increase the chaos, force more people to join the guerrillas, and greatly increase the difficulty of the Japanese troops' supply and transportation. The recent plan to station troops in all the occupied towns and cities in the interior, if properly implemented, may be more effective, but to do so with insufficient military strength is worse than useless. In any case, the Japanese troops have still failed to dominate the vast mountainous areas. Some experts believe that the Japanese troops must redeploy at least 500,000 more troops in order to suppress North China, but the Japanese troops do not seem willing to do so. Therefore, it is difficult to predict when and how the Japanese troops will be able to complete this task. (Sent on May 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e12">禮榆：The Reason for the Sharp Contraction of the Black Market Exchange Rate <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Although the exchange rate quoted by HSBC Bank the day before yesterday still maintained its usual benchmark, it actually suspended supply, resulting in various rumors and a surge in buying interest. Within a single day, it contracted from eight and a quarter pence to around seven pence. As for the reasons for the sharp contraction, there were various rumors in the market. Some said that the 20 million pound foreign exchange fund established in March had already been used up. Others said that allied newspapers would no longer be willing to supply foreign exchange. Such malicious propaganda filled the market. This is indeed a deliberate attempt to undermine the legal tender, and the remarks of speculators who have ulterior motives are absolutely not to be believed.</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign exchange fund issue, according to the most malicious estimates from the Japanese side, approximately 1.5 million pounds must be supplied each month to maintain the level of eight and a quarter pence. Therefore, when the fund was established, the Japanese side expressed the opinion that although a 10 million pound fund could be maintained for seven or eight months, the foreign exchange fund has only been established for more than two months. Even according to the malicious estimates of the Japanese side, there is absolutely no reason for it to be used up. Therefore, such rumors are really not worth believing.</p>
<p>The close commercial relationship between the British, American, and other allied countries and China will definitely not allow the decline in the exchange rate of legal tender to affect their trade with China, especially Britain, which is even more concerned. Many facts in the past have been sufficient to prove Britain's enthusiasm for supporting the legal tender, and the establishment of the foreign exchange fund is even more sufficient to demonstrate its determination to safeguard Far Eastern interests. Since the commercial interests of the allied countries are completely consistent with China's interests, and China's War of Resistance has signs of turning defeat into victory, then the allied countries will definitely be willing to continue to maintain the legal tender. Therefore, such rumors are completely beyond the scope of common sense.</p>
<p>As for the real reason for the sharp contraction in the exchange rate, it is really the malicious propaganda and conspiracy policies to undermine the legal tender.</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese banknotes have flooded the Shanghai market, and prices have fallen. At the lowest point, 89 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 100 Japanese yen. This is clearly a manifestation of the weakness of Japan's economic power. Although Japan nominally claims to be a victorious country, it has already shown that it cannot compete with China economically. Japan knows that this is an exposure of its weaknesses, which is also a sign of China's long-term victory in the War of Resistance. Therefore, it must find a way to cover it up and try to make the credit of the Japanese yen higher than that of the legal tender. However, although they have used various means to curb the decline of the Japanese yen, they have ultimately failed to reverse the decline. Although the Japanese yen once recovered to 95 yuan (the price per 100 Japanese yen), it fell again to 91 yuan the day before yesterday. They know that the credit of the Japanese yen is not easy to restore, so they changed direction and attacked the legal tender, hoping to relatively restore the status of the Japanese yen after the price of the legal tender falls.</p>
<p>At the same time, although the "Huaxing Bank" officially started business on May 16, because of the consolidation of the credit of the legal tender, the so-called "Huaxing coupons" could not gain a foothold. From the date of commencement of business to the end of May, the total amount of Huaxing coupons issued was only 220,000 yuan, and all of them were used to requisition materials from the people in the occupied areas. Its shadow has never been seen in the concession. The Japanese side knew that this plan was not working, and because of the stability of the exchange rate of the legal tender, they planned to attack the legal tender again to indirectly support the "Huaxing coupons".</p>
<p>Because of the above two reasons, the Japanese side has recently used the legal tender it has collected (which was exchanged for "United Bank coupons" and military scrip) to heavily speculate on foreign exchange. From the Chinese side, since the establishment of the foreign exchange fund, there should have been more than enough to cope with it. However, during this wartime, the importance of foreign exchange is greater than in the past. If we allow the Japanese side to take it arbitrarily, it is tantamount to arming the enemy. In order to maintain China's vitality and prevent Japan's conspiracy, we have to limit the supply of foreign exchange. This is a means of defending the legal tender, which is not only harmless to the credit of the legal tender, but also can consolidate the foundation of the legal tender.</p>
<p>From the above situation, we can know that the credit of the legal tender is not a problem at all. The decline in the black market exchange rate is really a conspiracy of those who deliberately undermine the legal tender. If everyone recognizes that the legal tender is the foundation of their own interests, they should remain calm, observe the truth of the matter, and not be misled by rumors, so as not to disrupt the credit of the legal tender and destroy our own defenses.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e13">On "Eliminating Depraved Customs" <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper reported that "Overseas Chinese will jointly petition the authorities to eliminate depraved customs and ban tour guide agencies." It is said that the number of existing tour guide agencies is in the hundreds, and the number of female tour guides is in the thousands... Since then, the business of geishas and prostitutes has paled in comparison... It is of great importance to social morality." However, what is even more serious is: "In the past, prostitution was banned to improve social morality, but now a phenomenon of leading people into lewdness and depravity has been discovered in Hong Kong, and its harm is thousands of times greater than that of public and private prostitutes!"</p>
<p>This serious problem is naturally a socio-economic problem, and therefore all reformist methods may not be able to achieve a truly thorough solution. But what is particularly noteworthy is that this phenomenon has suddenly become serious since the Japanese launched a large-scale attack on our country. Therefore, we cannot but feel resentment towards those who run the business of leading people into depravity, and we cannot but feel regret towards those who forget the national crisis and family hatred and only know how to play and indulge. As for the women who are forced to work as "tour guides," we can only give them the sympathy and pity that compatriots deserve!</p>
<p>The petition of the overseas Chinese is not only for maintaining the reputation of Hong Kong, but also for upholding the reputation of the Chinese people, especially Chinese women. We hope that this movement will be successful. We also hope that this problem will be solved more thoroughly, not only to prevent these thousands of women from turning into disguised scapegoats who suffer and suffer, but also to enable them to have happy and independent work and become righteous, free, and independent people, working for the liberation of China, for themselves, and for the country!</p>

<h3 id="e14">British Public Opinion Clearly States a Solemn Attitude Demanding the Maintenance of the Peace Front Eden's Speech Elaborates <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech to Conservative Party demonstrators near Warwick today that since Britain has decided to organize a peace front, the government authorities must not hesitate. Eden went on to warn that all non-aggressive countries, regardless of their political system, should be included in the peace front, otherwise it would be the most unwise move. When discussing the Soviet Union, Eden said, "Although we do not like communism, the fact that the Soviet Union is a non-aggressive country and does not seek to expand its territory should not be denied."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Minister for Coordination of Defence, Chatfield, said in a speech in Cleeves, Scotland, today, "If we unfortunately have to fight again, the reason will be for glory and justice, which is what all our compatriots believe is right." Chatfield continued, "Although Britain is actively preparing for defense, no one should be under the illusion that war is inevitable. We now have some new responsibilities. Our attitude has changed from 'worrying about the weak' to 'helping the weak'. If Britain concludes an agreement with other countries, it will also be announced to make its purpose clear to the world."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] "The German government, encouraged by Ribbentrop, still firmly believes that Britain is unwilling to go to war. This fact and the speeches of Halifax and Chamberlain are the biggest crisis in the current serious European situation." The above words are a report from the "Daily Telegraph" Paris correspondent, which can also reflect the attitude of French people towards Zhang and Ha's public speeches when they once again put forward new suggestions to the Soviet Union. The newspaper also said that Chamberlain and others' expressions of emotion have been generally approved, but they fear that the German side will misunderstand that Britain's determination has been shaken. Even British officials have voiced criticism. The Labor Party demands an explanation as to whether Chamberlain wants to restore his policy of compromise, but people close to the Prime Minister say that the purpose of this speech is to reduce the stimulating effect on Berlin of Britain's new proposals to the Soviet Union, as Britain has now fully accommodated the Soviet Union's point of view.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, London, 10th) This morning, the "Yorkshire Post" commented that the compromising tone used in the recent speeches of Chamberlain and Halifax was not only displeasing to the opposition, but also to some people who supported the government. The opposition is deeply afraid that Sterling's dispatch to the Soviet Union will cause adverse reactions. The Conservative Party criticized the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, saying that publishing these remarks at this time was, at the very least, inappropriate. The newspaper also said that Chamberlain and Halifax should not have made such remarks at this time, so as not to increase the difficulties of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The Labor Party will demand an explanation in the House of Commons as to whether the government's recent declaration indicates that it is abandoning the new anti-aggression policy and restoring the old "compromise policy".</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Chamberlain said in a speech in his hometown of Birmingham that he firmly believed that the whole country could support his current policy. In order to seek the safety of the country, he had adopted two parallel and different policies: striving to eliminate the crisis of war and building national strength, so that when discussing conditions with any country in the future to resolve disputes, he would not be forced to accept conditions that were not honorable or detrimental to our survival interests. Regarding the first part of this dual policy, Chamberlain said that he had hoped to reach an understanding with some countries, but had repeatedly retreated due to disappointment. As for the second part of the policy, namely national defense work, there has been rapid progress, and any powerful country will find it difficult to match Britain. People all over the world also know that we will never use this power to provoke anyone, although there are those who hope to disturb public opinion with propaganda, but facts speak louder than words. What we resolutely resist is the ambition to dominate Europe, because we believe that once such an ambition succeeds, there will never be a day for peace in Europe. However, Britain will still not give up the first part of its policy advocacy, and Chamberlain continued to describe his attempts to resolve disputes peacefully and hope to witness its success.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] After visiting the British Pavilion today, the British King and Queen appeared on the lawn, where there were many invited guests. The King looked tired, while the Queen did not show any signs of fatigue. Many British, Canadian, West Indian and American veterans stood solemnly when the British King and Queen appeared. The King stepped forward to talk to one or two old, white-haired veterans, and then drove to Columbia University, where there were many welcomers, some of whom had been waiting all day for the King to pass by. Upon arrival at Columbia University, the President gave them a warm reception and delivered a welcoming speech. Afterwards, the King and Queen returned to President Roosevelt's residence in Hyde Park. They will not go out on Sunday to rest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] The British King and Queen landed on Manhattan Island, New York, on the destroyer "Warrington" that day. The enthusiastic welcome from the people was "more grand than when Lindbergh returned victoriously." Governor Lehman introduced the members of the welcoming committee and New York Mayor LaGuardia to the King. The King warmly shook hands with everyone as a courtesy. The military band first played "God Save the King" and then played the American national anthem. More than 100,000 people welcomed them outside the port. The King rode in the first car, followed by a convoy of twelve cars, and 42 police motorcycles and bicycles led the way. New Yorkers scattered pieces of paper on the skyscrapers, which is a local tradition. The situation was very lively. From the port to the World's Fair, the roads were crowded with joyous crowds. It is estimated that 4 million people gathered on the street in the scorching heat of 90 degrees to see the King's appearance. In addition to plainclothes detectives, there were 15,000 police officers maintaining order. The enthusiasm of the people was unprecedented. The most prominent in the welcoming crowd was the appearance of millions of children, who waved British and American flags to attract the attention of the two Majesties. This enthusiasm was finally rewarded. The Queen smiled and nodded frequently, and the King also raised his hand to salute continuously. An hour before the two Majesties arrived in the city, the World's Fair was already packed. The enthusiastic situation was only seen since the opening of the meeting. Police were stationed at every passageway. After getting out of the car, the King and Queen took the elevator directly to the third floor to be received in the Perisphere Hall. The King and Queen met with the directors of various pavilions and the main officials of the New York City government in the hall. After having lunch in the Federal Building, the two Majesties toured the Irish and Canadian pavilions. When the two Majesties were approaching the British Pavilion, fireworks were set off, and thousands of British and American flags were hung on small parachutes. Boy Scouts and children scrambled to pick them up as souvenirs. According to the police chief, more than 3 million people witnessed the welcoming ceremony, which was the most enthusiastic since Lindbergh's return across the Atlantic in 1927.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<p>Relief for Unemployed Teachers in War Zones</p>
<p>How to overcome the new difficulties in the new stage of the War of Resistance to win the final victory? How to cultivate the power of national rebirth to lay the foundation for future national construction and national revival? This is the most serious question in the current Chinese liberation movement, and it is also the most urgent and important task for the entire Chinese nation. To perfectly solve these problems and thoroughly complete these tasks, the key lies in promoting and thoroughly realizing the total mobilization of the spiritual and material resources of the entire nation, and in universally and practically conserving and cultivating the future builders of our country and nation. Here, we urgently need ten thousand, hundred thousand propagandists, organizers, trainers, and leaders! The position and task of primary and secondary school teachers and vocational instructors are particularly important.</p>
<p>However, in the 23 months of the War of Resistance, not only have the majority of teacher training institutions been unable to continue to exist, resulting in a shortage of a large number of teachers who meet the new needs of the War of Resistance and national construction, but also due to the lack of overall preparation before the War of Resistance and the lack of an overall plan and unified steps after the War of Resistance, many of the original teachers have also abandoned their positions as the war zone expanded, becoming unemployed, wounded, killed, and displaced under the enemy's artillery fire. As for the teachers in the occupied areas, in addition to those who have directly joined the anti-Japanese and anti-traitor teams, the majority have been subjected to the lewd power of the enemy and traitors. Besides being utilized, imprisoned, and killed, many have also been displaced. The Third National Education Conference, in view of this, had a central resolution on relieving unemployed teachers in war zones, and recent reports have stated that some areas in the Northwest are carrying out all active relief work, and Jiangsu Province also promulgated measures to relieve unemployed teachers in war zones a few days ago, and the Guangdong Provincial authorities seem to have been carrying out registration work for relieving unemployed children and primary school teachers in Hong Kong for some time. In addition to pointing out that it is necessary to simultaneously pay attention to cultivating a large number of new cadres and new teachers who meet the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction, we should also regard relieving unemployed teachers in war zones, occupied areas, and overseas refugees as the most important cause at present.</p>
<p>However, we must also pay attention at the same time: Firstly, this work is a major task of the entire nation based on the new needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance and national construction. It is not just a passive relief, but should be an active organization and training. Therefore, in addition to conducting a larger-scale registration and investigation, we must also actively prepare for the establishment of these organizations and training institutions for teachers, and teach them the basic knowledge that meets the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction, such as national unity, long-term resistance, the Three Principles of the People for national construction, and wartime education programs, methods, and approaches that adapt to special circumstances, as well as wartime service methods, etc. Secondly, this work should be carried out universally and practically in war zones, occupied areas, the rear, and even overseas. On the one hand, it is necessary to adapt to the special conditions of different regions, and on the other hand, there must be a consistent spirit and unified leadership, that is, not to violate the revolutionary principles of the Three Principles of the People and the leadership of the united front. In addition, in terms of methods, we must follow the leadership of the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek and the relevant authorities, and at the same time call on leaders in the education and cultural circles and famous figures from Chinese and foreign society to jointly assist in carrying out the work.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Britain and France Drafting New Plan Bringing to Moscow to Let the Soviet Side Choose <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Regarding the issue of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British government has drafted a new plan and is preparing to hand it over to Sterling, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to bring to Moscow. In order to inquire about the views of the French authorities beforehand, French Ambassador Corbin notified the French Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 10th that the French government, on the whole,</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The opinions and criticisms put forward in the British Foreign Office's reply to the Soviet Union are being carefully studied. The French side will decide its attitude later and will notify the British government. In addition, the British Foreign Office representative Sterling, after arriving in Moscow, will propose several plans to the Soviet side in order to solve the Baltic Sea problem, and the Soviet side will choose one of them.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] Haitong News Agency has learned that the draft tripartite agreement will be returned to London today, together with the revised draft proposed by the French Foreign Office. The draft agreement includes the British proposal that the Soviet Union can declare its "important interests" to be the security of the Baltic countries. It is heard that the French side agrees with the British proposal, that is, to put forward multiple methods for the Soviet Union to choose from, to see which one is the most suitable way for its opinion of guaranteeing the Baltic countries. French Foreign Minister Bonnet also met with Soviet Ambassador Lyszy, informing him that the proposed amendments and the draft will be notified to Moscow at the weekend. According to today's "News Chronicle", several cabinet members advocate selecting a cabinet member to go to the Soviet Union instead of the Foreign Office expert Sterling, but Sterling will definitely go to Moscow. According to the latest plan, Mr. Sterling will fly to the Soviet capital via the Swedish capital on Monday and arrive in the evening.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Geneva, 11th] Yesterday, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol received a declaration from Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and a note from former Czech President Beneš to the League of Nations and the Soviet Union. Mr. Xi's declaration stated that, due to legal prohibitions, he was unable to read Yuan Ness's note at the last League of Nations meeting. Today, on behalf of the Soviet government, he requested that the League of Nations notify all member states of this note. In the note, Mr. Yuan protested against Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and Hungary's armed invasion of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, saying that this not only violated the rights and interests of the Czech people, but also harmed the authority and responsibility of the League of Nations, and that such incidents were intolerable to him. Therefore, he requested the Chairman of the League of Nations to propose to the Executive Council to consider the steps to resolve this matter. Mr. Bei also said that although he had no right to make proposals to the League of Nations, he had represented Czechoslovakia in supporting the League of Nations and maintaining world peace for 17 years, so this action was not illegal.</p>

<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>——British-Soviet Negotiations——British-German Relations——British-French and German-Italian Relations——The Struggle for Spain——The Balkans——Hesitation——British-Turkish Agreement——Greece——Romania——Yugoslavia——</p>
<p>After Litvinov's resignation, the British-Soviet negotiations, which had been constantly overshadowed by uncertainty, loosened. Now, the Soviet representative originally scheduled to attend the Geneva conference, the current Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin, suddenly suspended his planned trip a few days ago. Thus, the cooperation talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, which had progressed to a considerable extent, were temporarily shelved. Judging from the current situation, it is unlikely that these negotiations will be genuinely emphasized again in the near future.</p>
<p>This shelving of British-Soviet negotiations is actually just a phenomenon, a result, and by no means a cause. What is the reason for it? There are two main and direct reasons: First, on the surface, it is due to the recent establishment of the British-Turkish agreement. From the British perspective, it has completely dismantled the foundation for a future British-Soviet alliance. Now, most of the countries surrounding the Soviet Union have mutual or unilateral assistance agreements with Britain. In Britain's view, this has already demonstrated complete sincerity in cooperating with the Soviet Union. As for further solidifying the alliance relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union through a treaty, that is just a matter of procedure. However, Britain does not feel it is necessary to go through this procedure at the moment, as it has not made the greatest determination to strike against the global aggressor states. From the Soviet perspective, because Potemkin recently made a trip to the Balkan Peninsula and Poland, he has confirmed the trust of various countries in the Soviet Union. Therefore, now that the surrounding countries have formed alliances with Britain, the Soviet Union does not need to rush into an alliance with Britain. Therefore, Britain has become complacent and the Soviet Union has become slack. Second, on the darker side, recently within Britain, because Mussolini delivered a relatively peaceful speech in Turin, the forces of appeasement towards Germany have regained momentum. They are still hoping that the current government will make another attempt to negotiate with Germany, using some possible concessions as conditions for Hitler to accept "peace," and asking him to specifically propose them. Therefore, the current British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, received orders to immediately present two points to the German authorities: (1) If Germany genuinely hopes for peace, then it should quickly propose it now that Britain is "willing to listen"; (2) Otherwise, in his "personal" view, Britain is now in a completely superior international military position against Germany. Therefore, when Britain, in essence, has become complacent, and on the surface, it is deliberately creating a vibrant atmosphere, constantly proclaiming negotiations for British-Soviet cooperation, while on the other hand, it is conducting behind-the-scenes negotiations with Germany to bargain for concessions, at this time, for the sake of diplomatic maneuvering, the Soviet Union adopted the tactic of Potemkin suddenly suspending his trip to Geneva.</p>
<p>As a result, British-Soviet negotiations have been temporarily shelved. Along with this, the entire European situation has also eased for a short period. However, everyone should immediately pay close attention: On the other hand, the British and Soviet authorities have therefore fallen into a tense trap: Is the possibility of a Soviet-German clash progressing again? Like a poisonous sore, this question is currently firmly gnawing at the hearts of those in Britain and France who advocate appeasement.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the past few days, British and French public opinion has been vigorously pressuring the government, and the government has had no choice but to quickly take steps to reassure the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important items in the talks between Halifax and Bonnet in Paris.</p>
<p>These are the most important trends in Europe at the moment. But in this matter, we encounter a problem: Why? Since Britain and France only hope to maintain a detached and consistent stance with the Soviet Union, mainly to bargain with Germany and Italy, why do they become so anxious at the mere hint of German expansion?</p>
<p>The most urgent point in answering this question at present lies in the tension in the Mediterranean situation. Therefore, the eyes of all of Europe are focused on the evolving situation in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Once, when the European situation was tense, the diplomatic representatives of six countries went to see Mussolini. They waited in the living room first. After a while, the door of the living room opened, and a "whoosh" sound slowly came. They silently looked towards the door.</p>
<p>"Good morning, everyone." By the time the six representatives turned around, Mussolini was already standing behind them like an Egyptian god. However, there was no trace of the door at all.</p>
<p>After finishing the conversation, old man Mo said, "Thank you, everyone, I will give you a reply at ten minutes to four in the afternoon."</p>
<p>At 3:50, the six diplomatic representatives walked into that living room again. After a while, the door opened again, and the "whoosh" sound came again. However, the six representatives were clear this time and stared at the wall opposite them.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, everyone." The six representatives quickly turned around, but Mussolini was already smiling and standing at the door.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1933, a British antiquarian named Peden took his female secretary Ruth to Rome for a trip. One afternoon, the two were strolling on the Piazza Venezia when Ruth accidentally fell. When she got up, she saw an ancient coin under a stone that she had kicked away. Peden took it back to the hotel and carefully studied it. He saw that one side had two blades of grass; the other side had the image of an emperor, and the inscription "46 B.C." was still faintly visible. This was incredible. Ancient coins from before the Common Era are rarely seen. Peden took it back to London, and later sold it to the New York Museum for $400,000, which Peden and Ruth split equally.</p>

<p>Since this is adorned with the guise of a "Weather Forecast," as the name suggests, we must talk about the weather. The Hong Kong Observatory predicts today's weather as: southwest wind, light and gentle, occasional gusts, dense mist, occasional showers. This means that today there will be both wind and rain. Anyway, in these days, the summer rain is continuous without a set date. If you want to go out, please learn from Mr. so-and-so's ingenuity and carry an umbrella; it won't hurt you. Also, it is best not to show off your white leather shoes.</p>
<p>Opening the calendar, I know that today is an auspicious day, and I think there should be many lovers getting married, "We are in love, and we will get married on the twelfth of last month." If a friend of yours is having a wedding, don't forget to reciprocate with a gift; don't forget to visit and offer your congratulations; and, even more so, don't forget to say, "I'll be back next year to eat wedding eggs."</p>

<p>Pickpockets in Moscow are exceptionally skilled, especially against foreign tourists. Wallets and money in their pockets are often lost, and small items such as small cameras and suitcases in their hands can disappear in crowded places.</p>
<p>Once, a foreign tourist passed through Moscow. He had long heard of the name of the pickpocket Kui Keko. He specially put a note in his pocket that read: "The one who steals this note is a pig pickpocket." When he went out for a walk and returned to the hostel, he found that the note had not been stolen, but a line of annotations had been added on the back: "The one who wrote this note is a pig pickpocket."</p>

<p>One: The Ship Carrying Gold</p>
<p>The newspaper was printed in large letters, stating that the German-American liner "Cologne" was carrying six million in gold bars from the United States to Germany. On the day she set sail, a large crowd of people rushed to the pier to watch the excitement, and it was so crowded that water could not leak through.</p>
<p>This was just a steel-made ship, with a large amount of property inside, and it attracted these people. Although it is not easy to guess what they expected to see, it is just like some people will stare at a prison, where there are clearly some criminals held, they stare at the four gray walls in a daze, but they do not hope to be able to go in and enjoy it themselves. Therefore, on the pier of the "Cologne," this group also used their inquisitive eyes to freely peep at this treasure box containing a huge amount of gold.</p>
<p>In the crowd, two brown-skinned youths, picking up their luggage and suitcases in their hands, managed to squeeze out.</p>
<p>"It's really amazing, Jack!" one cried out. He was pushing aside two fat men and women with his elbows. The man stared at the side of the ship blankly, with no intention of giving way. The woman opened her mouth wide and her eyes protruded, as if she hoped to turn the black hull into gold.</p>
<p>"Yes, gold is a big magnet, even if it has been wrapped up and sent into the ship's vault." Jack Reed replied. "Compared to that, being on such a ship, we feel like millionaires ourselves."</p>
<p>"This is also one of the pleasures of the holiday." Bill Nanno laughed, "If the pirates of ancient times were still alive, this would be a good opportunity for them. Then, when we sailed on this "Cologne" ship, we could really watch a thrilling scene."</p>
<p>Jack was a radio operator on the Chuks Mail Ship Asia, and Bill was a mechanic. Because they had helped Mr. Chuks find his lost younger brother, Chuks specially granted them a holiday, and they decided to travel to Europe during this holiday.</p>
<p>In fact, at the time they boarded this gold-carrying ship, some weapons in Europe were already clanking and rattling. Moreover, several hours ago, this great war, which was almost universal to the globe, was already destined to break out. Naturally, they had no premonition about this matter at all. They were putting their belongings into the cabin. The ship's whistle roared, and a tremor passed through the huge hull. She left the pier, the steel band began to play, and the crowd on the deck and the crowd on the pier waved vigorously. At that time, it was simply impossible to distinguish these mixed sounds.</p>
<p>"Okay, it's finally sailing. Jack, Bill said, he took Jack's arm and leaned against the side of the ship, looking at the skyscrapers towering into the sky, saying goodbye again and again.</p>
<p>Jack stared blankly at the two tall masts rising into the sky, with the radio antennas swaying between the two masts.</p>
<p>"Thinking that someone else is sending the radio now, it feels a bit special." He said lazily, softly reciting the unceasing radio code, indicating "goodbye."</p>
<p>"Enough, I've never seen such a person!" Bill shouted. "Always forgetting your endless radio! But--" he suddenly shouted, "That's someone we know!" Coming towards them was a nimble, small man, with a neat mustache on his lip, dressed very neatly, seemingly a bit too stylish.</p>
<p>"What, that's the French pilot Louis Garros! We saved his property in the Florida Sea!" Jack shouted.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Tung Oil Expert Talks About the Prospects of Sino-American Tung Oil Trade American Planting of Tung Progresses Gradually, but Production Is Still Limited In the Next Few Years, China Will Still Be Relied On for Supply <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil is a major commodity in China's export trade, especially the trade volume between China and the United States is the largest. According to a certain expert familiar with Sino-American tung oil trade issues, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, tung oil produced in China has been more difficult to ship to the United States than usual due to transportation issues. There is no need to deny it. Therefore, when the war first broke out, American oil prices soared. Affected by this, the tung oil industry in the states along the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, namely Florida, Louisiana, etc., tried to step up production. According to the early part of this century, the above-mentioned states began to plant tung trees and try to operate an oil extraction industry. After decades of hard work, although this oil industry has made a lot of progress today, its output is still limited and not enough to meet the large domestic demand. Therefore, China is still relied on for supply year after year and is increasing year by year. It reached its peak in 1937. It is estimated that the tung oil imported from China to the United States in that year reached 175,000,000 pounds, while the domestic production in the United States was the highest last year (1938), but it was also not four, 000,000 pounds. The difference in supply is very far. Judging from this, it can be known that in the next few years, the tung oil market in the United States will still need to purchase large quantities from China, which is beyond doubt. As for the situation of Americans planting tung trees, in the initial period, they did not know what was suitable for soil quality, tung tree species, and climate dryness and humidity, so the losses were very large. In recent years, they have worked hard to research and have made great progress. The current price in the United States is completely dependent on the supply situation in China. In the past two years, due to the war, oil prices have fluctuated greatly. When the Japanese army occupied Shanghai in November 1937, the oil supply to the United States was interrupted for a time, and the US oil price soared to a huge 22 cents per pound. However, due to the large quantities of tung oil being exported through Hong Kong, the oil price fell accordingly. Until Guangzhou fell in October last year, it rose again to 15 cents per pound. Since then, oil prices have been hovering between 12 cents and 15 cents. Now China's tung oil is again being exported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. The government is actively encouraging planting and paying attention to refining in the rear provinces to improve quality. In short, American tung planting is improving day by day. If China wants to maintain its original position, it should pay attention to improving it at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e30">China's Literature and Art in the War of Resistance <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Lao She</p>
<p>Introduction: Today's Chinese literary scene, we can say without hesitation, stands under the banner of the whole nation's war of resistance, exerting all efforts to sound the bugle call for national salvation and survival. The entire nation is struggling in blood, and it is difficult to find in literature any praise or appreciation for romantic love and natural beauty; if one happens to see dialogues about such things, their colors will surely be blood red. The entirety of literary and artistic works can simply be called a war song.</p>
<p>Poets, playwrights, novelists, and literary theorists have all joined hands to organize the National Literary and Art Circles Anti-Aggression Association. Factions and opinions, which separated literary comrades in ordinary times, even if they did not antagonize each other, were each governing their own way, not interacting with each other. The sound of cannons on July 7th stirred the hearts of the most sensitive writers; with the same scenery in front of everyone and only one common enemy in everyone's heart, naturally everyone turned their pens outward. The association has only one policy, which is sincere unity to strive for the victory of the nation. Members write and propagate in extremely difficult living conditions. Whoever comes to teach them to write, they are happy to follow, as long as what they write is related to war propaganda. They also go to the people, to the army, presenting poems, songs, and wall newspapers to the people and soldiers as spiritual food.</p>
<p>In terms of poetry, because of the war of resistance, it strives to be激昂and obvious, able to be recited, so that it can enter everyone's ears, arousing the passion to love the nation and resist tyranny. Moreover, almost every day one can see touching and admirable facts in the newspapers. Villagers and vendors often become national heroes. The responsibility of singing about these heroic deeds naturally belongs to the poets. The glory of poets has now become the glory of the nation.</p>
<p>Drama must be performed, and therefore it is even more suitable for propaganda. In cities and villages, for raising winter clothes, donating money, comforting wounded soldiers, and sending off departing troops, there are dramatic performances and actors' activities. This kind of activity evokes the tears of many soldiers and people. When performing for comforting wounded soldiers, wounded brothers often shout "Go to the front line again" and then, in fact, rush to the front.</p>
<p>Reportage is even more the favorite of heaven, it is true, simple, vivid and powerful. The people in the rear are concerned about their children on the front lines, and the brothers on the front lines are eagerly looking forward to news from their hometown. This true and powerful report not only reports victory, but also unites the hearts of the nation.</p>
<p>Long novels have not yet appeared. In order to achieve immediate and effective propaganda results, short stories, because they are short and convenient, are produced in large quantities to meet the needs. Among them are many excellent works, because what is written is the writers' true experience - serving in the army or in exile chased by enemy aircraft, or having searched through the burned-down cities, or having seen fellow citizens with severed limbs. All of these are writing materials, and they cannot be stored in the heart, but must be written out immediately. Who can bury these tragic facts? In general, poems, dramas, and novels all strive to be vigorous and clear for the sake of the war of resistance. However, the writers know that these things may not be easily understood by illiterate compatriots, even if someone reads them to listen. Therefore, writers have to combine them with the original folk art forms, following the folk tradition of performing dramas accompanied by stringed instruments and singing storytelling songs, and creating new things with lyrics recited by bamboo clappers, so that the literate can read and the illiterate can listen. This popular function is also being produced as much as possible in order to penetrate the people and carry out extensive propaganda.</p>
<p>In a few small towns, you may see a wall newspaper copied by middle school students. On this wall newspaper, you can see brief war news, small essays, illustrated stories, and one or two poems, or folk songs; new folk songs. Ah, then you will know. All kinds of literary and artistic styles are being applied on the streets, all serving the war of resistance; even the form of folk songs has not been abandoned. From this small wall newspaper, you can imagine today's Chinese literary scene.</p>
<h3 id="e31">On the Weaknesses of Literary Criticism in the War of Resistance <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>Theoreticians point out the weaknesses of literary and artistic works during the war of resistance in two sentences, saying: "Works lag behind reality, and criticism lags behind works." Especially the latter - criticism - is indeed the weakest link in the literary and artistic activities of the War of Resistance. Its intensification and strengthening has become a consistent request of most literary workers recently.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is not that we have no criticism, nor is it that our criticism has not achieved some results. Mao Dun's "Thoughts in August," Zhu Xiuxia's "On Realist Anti-Japanese War Literature," Ai Siqi's "Trends in Anti-Japanese War Literature," Xiang Linbing's "The Development and Defects of Popular Literature Movement Since the War of Resistance," etc., are all excellent criticisms: general literary publications often have book reviews, which are naturally criticisms; even many short literary commentaries published in newspapers and magazines are mostly critical in nature. We cannot say that these criticisms have not had an effect on writers and readers; it's just that it is far from enough and very weak. Therefore, if we now say that we want to expand criticism work and intensify criticism work, it is not enough to merely emphasize the importance of criticism; we must further examine the weaknesses of past criticisms in order to explore the concrete direction of future criticism.</p>
<p>First, general literary publications often have book reviews, and some progressive newspapers and publications also often have articles reviewing literary works. There are also excellent and solid criticisms, such as some book reviews published by Mao Dun in "Wen Zhen." Although they are mostly introductory in nature, they often contain precise arguments, seemingly written casually, but revealing the brilliance of theory. It is worth learning from.</p>
<p>However, many authors' reviews cannot satisfy us. They often contain only a description of the work's outline, plus abstract or even dispensable comments. When talking about the good aspects, it is that the theme is positive and the character creation is quite successful; when talking about the bad aspects, it is that the grasp of reality is not enough, and the atmosphere description is not very accurate, etc. They do not clearly point out the good and bad aspects of the work. In reality, the so-called criticism stops at the introduction of the work's outline. Recently, there has been a trend of mutual respect among writers, which is good and necessary; but mutual respect does not mean being polite to each other, and it cannot ignore the necessary mutual criticism. Many literary friends are suffering from this problem. This is also a factor in the backwardness of criticism work. Therefore, I feel that the practical and impolite style of Zhang Zhenya's "Review of Tian Jian's Recent Works" (Wen Zhan, Volume 1, Issue 2) really needs to be promoted.</p>
<p>The object of our criticism! A specific work and general works are both products of Chinese society during the war of resistance and have many things in common with general works. Therefore, when we conduct criticism, we should maintain the attitude of taking a specific work as an example and criticizing general works. When we criticize one point of a specific work, we should establish or concretely explain a theory, which can be used as a sharp weapon for dissecting general works. Under this requirement, those generalized criticisms are of course useless things. We must look at a specific work from general works, and our criticism can see the general from the particular. At the same time, when we look at a specific work from general works, we can explore the characteristics of the work and give it the evaluation it deserves—this is said incidentally.</p>
<p>Second, the War of Resistance literature is Chinese youth literature, a new development. In these twenty-plus months, it did not make great achievements, so anxious friends mentioned the issue of producing great works to the literary scene for the second time; however, it is indeed accelerating development. The number of literary publications and supplements is more than before the war, and unlike before, they are concentrated in a corner of Shanghai. With the demands of reality, the writers are scattered, and new people appear in various places one after another. The buds of literature sprout in different soils. Under this new situation, although great works have not yet been produced, new styles and works with new atmosphere are emerging one after another. The emergence of these works may be a prelude to the production of great works. Many poems, narrative poems, oratorical literature, and popular literature are special products of literature during the War of Resistance. How should critics "deal with" these special products?</p>
<p>Unfortunately. Most critics do not seem to pay much attention to works with new styles and new atmosphere, do not put them forward for special attention, do not develop their advantages, and do not criticize their shortcomings. When a new style of work appears, it does not attract the attention, discussion, and research of friends who love literature in various places, and it encounters the fate of self-generation and self-destruction. Even if it is excellent and has development prospects, no one will continue to create and carry it forward. This is a great loss to the literature of the War of Resistance. Critics should bear a great responsibility for causing this loss. In the future, we must earnestly remedy the weakest link in the work of criticism.</p>
<p>Third, many long and short essays have appeared in the literary world, and there is no longer a trend of belittling essays or merely selling some imported goods. This is a sign of progress. Some of those essays are critical in nature, and there have been excellent works; however, the general drawback is that they do not start with a concrete analysis of the work. They only say that the literature of the War of Resistance is not good in this way or that way, and should be done in this way or that way, but they do not point out which works have the problems you criticize, and what their pathological state is. Therefore, although they are reasonable, they sometimes leave people confused, and thus lose the function of criticism.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have advocated that we should hold a general review of literary and artistic works since the War of Resistance as soon as possible. If it is said that criticism work is necessary, this general review is the only way to go. Without starting from reviewing works, comprehensive critical essays will become shooting without a target and will be of little benefit to writers and readers.</p>
<p>The above are just a few very rough points. Please correct and supplement them, friends.</p>
<p>The contents of this publication are divided into (1) short literary essays, (2) criticism of works, (3) members' communications, (4) literary news, and (5) reports on association affairs. It is attached to the supplements of Ta Kung Pao, Pearl River, Shen Bao, and Xingdao newspapers on Mondays in rotation. Members are invited to contribute actively. Manuscripts should be sent to P.O. Box 171, Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e32">"The Rising Sun Will Not Rise Again" <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>—Reading "North China Front"—</p>
<p>It is not a news chronicle, not a novel, and certainly not a treatise. "North China Front," I think this book should be read and cherished as a great work of reportage.</p>
<p>"Although the Japanese invasion has horrifyingly brought disaster and suffering to China, this baptism of blood and fire has simultaneously created progressive forces in China's old society; if these forces can be unimpeded, they may transform this suffering country into a free and democratic polity like that of Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>"The entire armed nation is slowly having unified command. And any army in the world that encounters the full force of this revitalized China will be crushed and defeated." ("The Rising Sun Will Not Rise Again")</p>
<p>This is how敏銳an observation, a firm belief – Bertrand Russell's conclusion to this unprecedented war is clear and powerful. His 250,000-word masterpiece reveals this great conclusion through imagery – we must be grateful!</p>
<p>The author takes a glimpse at Japan before the war. Entering Beiping was when the sounds of war were already resounding. He said goodbye to a beautiful and indifferent ancient capital. He embarked on a journey to northern Shaanxi and spent the New Year of 1938 in the snow-covered mountains. When he saw that dark Beiping again, revisited the mad island nation, and then left resolutely, it was after the Battle of Taierzhuang, the "second spring" of the war.</p>
<p>The author recorded the opening battles of Pingjin, the battles of Pingxingguan, Xinkou, and Yangmingbao, but only with fine lines of imagery; he made a "close-up" of Mao Zedong, Zhu De, He Long, Xiao Ke, Liu Shaoqi, Wang Zhen, Zhao Chengzhou, etc., which was very lively, but only had the bare bones. As for sparsely writing about the cruelty of the Japanese invaders, the defeat of Taiyuan, and the rise of the new masses, they are all the same as many sides, many "trivialities." However, those are not accidental phenomena, but are used to reveal the inevitable. The author entered the fragmented Shanxi Bureau, and he was not surprised. He finally saw China's rebirth, the inevitability of victory! In the deep mountains and in the countryside, he discovered the masses and the masses' army. He warmly stayed with them, and therefore felt that the invaders would surely be crushed and defeated! He wrote down all the warmth in his heart, and at the same time, he unceremoniously revealed the crux of the "old China," so that we are strongly moved and encouraged, and are convinced and willing to expand the vitality that China has gained. He, the author, said this: Outsiders think that China is completely in the hands of the invaders, "but after seeing the surpassing vitality of these people, I have no doubts about their final victory. In the current storms and difficulties of the war, a new China will soon emerge - a 'completely different' new China." - The author is now using his heart and blood to announce this to the world.</p>
<p>With his talented brush, he lightly sketches a few strokes, and the large and small mass soldiers all become alive; they are all determined to fight – when this determination to resist is universal to everyone's heart, the Japanese invaders will encounter the full force of a revitalized China and be crushed!</p>
<p>…The headquarters of our destination had already moved that night – no one knew the exact location. Our future will encounter danger.</p>
<p>"So what do we do?"</p>
<p>The platoon leader shrugged his broad shoulders and moved forward. "If you meet your comrades, you can naturally find the brigade commander." He didn't seem to think that we might meet the Japanese army first.</p>
<p>Outside the office, I said goodbye to my bodyguard… "Don't you want to go to England with me?" I asked him, this is what we often talked about in our chats.</p>
<p>He smiled as usual and asked back, pulling up his hanging pants, "Do you like to take me?"</p>
<p>"Seriously!"</p>
<p>He scratched his ears, thought for a moment, and finally shook his head and said, "I can't go to England now."… "I'm not afraid, but now we have to protect North China, we are all very needed. Everyone should..."</p>
<p>This cannot but move the author, and also moves everyone. "Old China" has been replaced, and mass soldiers have grown!</p>
<p>The author shattered Japan's propaganda of accusing us of being communist. He showed the true face of the border areas and the united front. He also announced to the world in a personal way: "Every battle has 'cruel things,' and those sane Western countries may currently think that it is just propaganda from both sides, not the facts, but I don't believe that the Shanxi civilians in the collapsed rural houses can understand these 'tricks.' And the Japanese invaders' cruel 'stories' are, this honest and tragic tone."</p>
<p>The author's conversation with the Chinese coolies in the Shenyang carriage room (see The Second Spring) reveals the hearts of the Chinese in the lost territories. For "Beiping in the darkness," he saw "hope" and predicted that the time to gain "new confidence" would eventually come.</p>
<p>In Tokyo. He pointed out that the madness of love and fear in the cheers of "Long Live" for sending troops has long become the most miserable farewell, a song-like unending farewell, making the soldiers unbearable, "no band, no flags, no cheers..."</p>
<p>"Everything is deceiving," "The Rising Sun Will Not Rise Again," this is a very beautiful conclusion.</p>
<p>Kisch, the author of Secret China, a great master of reportage, said that the author of reportage must work closely with the oppressed, and Bertrand Russell and several other international friends have done this, and we should be grateful.</p>
<p>The oppressed will surely turn over!</p>

<p>— Xi Sheng</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's recent play, "Geneva," is a political play that satirizes the characters on the modern international stage. It was performed at the Malvern St. Combs Theatre last summer and won excellent reviews. However, Shaw once said that he did not want to publish a single edition until the sister play of the play was written. However, Shaw has recently changed his mind, partly because the calligrapher Topolski has inserted many illustrations for the play, all of which are watercolors and sketches, which made Shaw unable to restrain his emotions. It is heard that it is being printed in the Constable bookstore, and the publishing company will publish the single edition this month after it has been revised, slightly different from the script when it was performed last summer. Furthermore, due to various reasons, the characters in the play were deliberately made up to avoid too direct allusions, but in the illustrations of Topolski in the single edition, all the characters satirized by Shaw have revealed their true faces.</p>
<p>Columbia Records recently hired the host of the Oxford University Poetry Recitation Society to design and record the recitation of British poems, named "The吟聲of Poetry" record set. The first collection will be recited by Ms. Edith Sitwell and Owen Evans, with a total of six 10-inch records, selecting 30 famous poems, from Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Keats and other famous poets to modern poets laureate, Masefield, and Laurence Binyon; de la Mare, and Alfred Noyes, etc., are all included. Each collection has a booklet with a preface by Binyon and annotations by Wallace Nichols.</p>
<p>American poet Waddington's new poetic drama "The Death of Garcia Lorca" was performed in New York on May 5.</p>
<p>This year's Pulitzer Prize has been decided to be awarded to R. E. Sherwood for his play "Lincoln in Illinois." Other award recipients are M. K. Rawlings for her work "Cross Creek," and Carl Van Doren's "Benjamin Franklin" also won the award.</p>
<p>This year's Heinemann Prize in the United Kingdom was decided to be awarded to Mrs. Camille M. Lang's novel "Black Woman," and the Stockton Literary Award was awarded to Robert Graves' novel "Count Belisarius."</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Er was hospitalized for two months due to appendectomy, but he was very diligent in writing and worked hard to select and translate famous Chinese anti-Japanese works into English and Esperanto, and to promote Chinese culture abroad. "New Works" has already been published by this association. Recently, the famous American "Fiction" has published Zhao Xuehen's translation of "Half a Catty of Wheat," and "International Literature," etc. have also published Mr. Ma Er's works recently.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Hong Kong's Import and Export Statistics for Last Year Show a Surplus of Approximately 70 Million Yuan. Exports Were 700,025,933 Yuan, Imports Were 627,770,155 Yuan. <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>As a transportation hub, our country's domestic imports and exports rely on this place for transportation, so it is known as the second largest commercial port in the Far East. However, in the past two years, South China has been under the ravages of war, and Hong Kong's import and export figures have suddenly decreased, especially last year due to the fall of Guangdong. The following is a report on the import and export figures for last year. Businessmen who are concerned about Hong Kong can see from this how the degree of impact is.</p>

<h3 id="e36">China Scout Troop – Wartime Return to Country Service Corps <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Will soon depart for frontline work; Hoping for donations of medicine and equipment from all sides.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident) in 1931, the Chinese Boy Scouts have regarded serving the country as their duty. The Guangzhou Boy Scouts were also ordered to participate in wartime service work, performing arduous duties continuously. After retreating from Guangzhou, a portion of the Boy Scouts withdrew to Hong Kong. Huang Xin, a committee member of the 13th Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps, was responsible for accommodating and providing supplies, awaiting deployment to the front lines. Now, with the military situation on the front lines becoming tense, there is an urgent need to mobilize manpower. Therefore, the former Guangzhou Boy Scout Captain Mai Xingnan was instructed to gather his members, provide strict training, and reorganize them. Once ready, they will be dispatched to serve on the front lines. This unit is named the "Chinese Boy Scout Wartime Return to Country Service Corps" and is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. A flag-presentation and oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for the 14th of this month. In addition to reporting the departure date to the Central Government via telegram, the Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman is also requested to instruct military and political organs along the route to provide protection, ensuring a safe arrival in the war zone on schedule. Furthermore, the corps has received consecutive sponsorships from Lingdao, Meifang, Fanglin, Zhonghua, Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, Overseas Chinese, Guanghua, Xinxu, Lizhe, Yangzhong and other schools, as well as Macao's Yuehua and Jizhong schools, the Provincial Relief Association, the Student Relief Association, the Youth Relief Association, the Women's Comfort Association and other organizations, and Xinghua, Yaorong, Nanfa, Nanqiang, Riqing and other companies and businesses. Preparations are quite complete. Considering the lack of medicine and equipment on the front lines, donations from various organizations and companies are requested to be taken to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Flood XX Drama Troupe – Arrives in Hong Kong from Macau – Will Report on Past Work Through Performances <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Flood XX Drama Troupe is purely an automatically organized group of Guangzhou's enthusiastic youth. Not fearing hardship, they went deep into villages and towns along the West and South Rivers to focus on war resistance propaganda, organization, training, fundraising, rescue, and assisting local governments in implementing policies. They have won the sympathy of local authorities and the public. Yesterday morning, the troupe leaders Chen Wenyuan, Huang Ninglin, Chen Jinwei, Huang Yanjing and others led all 34 troupe members from Macau to Hong Kong on the Guangfu Xiang Steamer. They appealed to sympathizers for financial assistance and will report on past work through performances, inviting leaders from all walks of life to visit and provide guidance. Once replenished and the performances are completed, they will transfer to the East River area to continue their efforts in the war of resistance.</p>

<h3 id="e39">French Currency Black Market Rises <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The legal currency of our country has recently fluctuated. However, the financial foundation of our country is solid, and the market price has stabilized in recent days. Yesterday was Sunday, and although the banks did not officially post prices, there was still a black market. The opening price yesterday morning was 458, rising to 460 at midday and closing at 453. Therefore, the legal currency exchange rate is clearly gradually rising. Financial observers believe that the cause of the fluctuations in the French currency exchange market was the release of a large amount of French currency in Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange, as well as the seasonal import and export relationship. Some overly sensitive people mistakenly believed that the successive visits of the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to Chongqing to meet with our authorities were related to mediation for peace, causing some financial speculators to take the opportunity to manipulate and attempt to profit privately, disregarding the overall situation. However, because our country has a firm financial policy, it is not enough to shake the true value of the French currency. Moreover, before this unfounded speculation spread, our government announced the strict arrest of Wang Zhaoming, causing some people to believe that the speculation about the visit of the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to Chongqing being related to mediation for peace was fundamentally untenable. This also has some relationship with the rise in the French currency.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Landlords' Greed is Insatiable – Residents of Shan Cun Road – Collectively Oppose Rent Increase – Ignoring Unreasonable Demands – Preparing to Meet in Court if Necessary <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of landlords raising rents has not diminished. Although the Legislative Council has passed the ordinance to prevent forced eviction for another year, with some revisions to the content, and the courts have ruled in favor of the tenants in several rental disputes, the Hong Kong government's efforts to protect ordinary residents can be said to be quite extensive. However, the landlords are still unwilling to give up, demanding from tenants in various ways to achieve the goal of raising rents. Moreover, the landlords jointly formed an association, acting in unison with great pressure. The tenants, on the other hand, are like scattered sand, allowing them to be defeated one by one, enduring in silence and allowing them to take whatever they want. The residents of Shan Cun Road are the first in Hong Kong to collectively confront the landlords. It is found that the tenants of numbers 2 to 26 of the road, due to the insatiable greed of the landlords, held a joint rooftop meeting last Friday night and decided to refuse the rent increase. The rent had already been increased by five dollars per month last month. Recently, the tenants received a notice from the landlord stating that the rent would be increased by twenty dollars per month starting from August. Only eleven days apart, the landlord made two requests for rent increases. Those who declared to the landlord that they could not afford the increase were told, "Please move out by the end of this month (June)." A standard form was also distributed to each household, stating that if they were willing to pay the increase, they must fill it out and sign it in person. Therefore, the residents of these numbers were extremely indignant and decided to take unified action to resist. It is heard that in addition to resolving to refuse this unreasonable rent increase, they will also ignore any forced eviction, and have reported the matter to the government. At the same time, they are raising funds to prepare for court if necessary.</p>

<p>On the 5th of this month, brazen robbers committed a daylight armed robbery of pedestrians on Li Yuen Street East in Des Voeux Road Central, resulting in a fierce shootout with police detectives, causing one death and six injuries. It was found that the two detectives who initially discovered the robbery were Tan Song and Yin Wen, and it was also Tan and Yin who shot the robbers and engaged them in a fierce battle. During the fierce battle, Detective Yin was unfortunately shot in the abdomen by the robbers, sustaining serious injuries. Afterwards, he was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. After the hospital doctors' careful treatment, his condition had improved slightly in recent days, and there was hope of escaping the danger period. However, the detective's condition suddenly took a turn for the worse yesterday morning and he passed away in the hospital at 11 AM. Those who heard the news felt sorry for him. The police authorities deeply mourned Detective Yin's dedication to his duty, bravely fighting and dying. They decided to provide generous compensation to his family to comfort his loyal soul. It is found that Detective Yin left behind a wife and a son, with a loving mother still alive. The son is only three years old, and the family is very destitute.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Guangzhou Mechanics Fleeing to Hong Kong – Some Go to Yunnan to Serve – Many Seek Employment in Hong Kong to Sustain Life <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>When Guangzhou fell, more than a hundred local mechanics, understanding the greater good, were unwilling to be used by the Japanese under their iron heel. They fled to Hong Kong together, without any means of support. They were received by the employees and workers of the Chinese Machinery Association of Hong Kong. However, this long-term idleness was not a long-term solution. Therefore, the Chinese Machinery Association submitted a request to the Guangdong Provincial Government to find a way to send them back to serve in the country. After the submission, the Guangdong Provincial Authorities immediately sent personnel to Hong Kong to investigate the names, ages, birthplaces, resumes, and work skills of the mechanics, and reported back to the authorities in Guangdong in detail. The Chinese Machinery Association also received a reply from the Provincial Government, stating that the matter had been handed over to the Refugee Relief Committee. However, the mechanics believed that since they were originally productive members of society, it would not be a good policy to be partially relieved by the Relief Committee due to unemployment. Therefore, some of the workers have started looking for jobs in Hong Kong to settle down temporarily and then figure out a solution. It is estimated that there are more than 110 mechanics who have come to Hong Kong. The employees and workers of the Chinese Machinery Association are introducing them to jobs. Some have found places to stay, while others who do not have jobs are still being hosted by various workers. They are now planning to further request the Central Government in Chongqing to provide accommodation. Recently, the Central Resources Committee in Hong Kong recruited machinery personnel to return to the country to serve. Personnel from the Committee's Hong Kong office have consulted with the persons in charge of the Chinese Machinery Association, planning to recruit the mechanics who fled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and send them back to serve in the country. After the Chinese Machinery Association consulted with the workers, due to salary issues and the different circumstances of each worker, each worker was free to apply. Now, some of the workers have passed the examination and will be selected by the Resources Committee and sent to Yunnan Province to serve in the coming days. Others who do not yet have jobs will wait for news from the authorities before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Chinese Registration – Excellent Results <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Reaching over 500 People</p>
<p>The Chinese voluntary registration, held after the British registration, has been underway for half a month and the results are excellent. According to official sources, as of now, the Chinese voluntary registration has reached over 500 people. According to Chinese representative Sir Robert Ho Tung, the Chinese voluntary registration will be officially closed at the end of this month, and it is hoped that those compatriots in Hong Kong who have not registered will do so as soon as possible. In addition, the Chinese representatives have launched a fundraising campaign to donate to the families of the personnel who died in the British submarine "Thetis". A considerable amount of money has now been raised, and there are many donors. The detailed amount of donations will be announced next week.</p>
<h3 id="e44">China Bus Adds New Route – Happy Valley – Shek Tong Tsui – Route Number 5A – Route Numbers 1 and 2 Slightly Changed <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the mainland war, the population of Hong Kong has suddenly increased, and all kinds of transportation vehicles are very crowded. China Bus Company, to facilitate the needs of passengers, has added a new route, called Route 5A. The company originally had Route 1, from Yaumati Pier to Happy Valley; Route 2, from Yaumati Pier to Taikoo Dockyard; Route 3, from Yaumati Pier to the University Hall; Route 3A, from Royal Pier to Mount Davis; Route 4, from Yaumati Pier to Queen Mary Hospital; Route 5, from Tai Hang to Kennedy Town; Route 6, from Yaumati Pier to Stanley; Route 6A, from Yaumati Pier to Repulse Bay; Route 7, from Yaumati Pier to Aberdeen; and Route 7A, from Aberdeen to Stanley. The newly added Route 5A is between Happy Valley and Shek Tong Tsui, starting from Kennedy Town, passing through Queen's Road West, Des Voeux Road Central, Des Voeux Road East, Leighton Hill Road, and Wong Nai Chung Road, turning over the Naval Memorial and returning to Queen's Road East, then back to Kennedy Town. This route has been approved by the government and will be implemented soon. The original Route 1, which runs between the Unified Pier and Happy Valley, will now bypass Johnston Road and go directly through Hennessy Road, Hunning Road, and Wan Chai Road to enter Happy Valley. Route 2, which runs between the Unified Pier and Taikoo Dockyard, will now bypass Lockhart Road and go directly through Hennessy Road. This will reduce the number of turns and road crossings, avoiding accidental dangers. After this new route is implemented, the regular monthly ticket of eight dollars will also be valid as usual.</p>
<p>Special Report of This Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e45">The Amateur Association of the Banking Industry – "Yinlian" is Developing <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>A Lively Social Gathering Was Held at the Confucius Hall the Other Night</p>
<p>The sounds and flames of the war of resistance changed everything. Look: Before August 13, 1937, there were a total of 1,300 Chinese bank employees in all of Hong Kong. After August 13, 1937, the number doubled in one fell swoop. The number of Chinese bank employees in all of Hong Kong is now over 2,600. This is because the financial centers of Shanghai and Hankou have moved to Hong Kong, and there are already more than 40 banks and silver firms. The central groups that have come from outside are, needless to say, the "Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications" and several other banks.</p>
<p>The "quantity" is increasing, and the "quality" is also changing. Who forced us to come to Hong Kong? No one will forget the blood-like lessons. Recalling how our beloved hometowns were ravaged by Japanese imperialism, looking at our motherland with smoke of war all over the sky, we are sheltered here. ??? Therefore, vigilant friends and outstanding members of the banking industry seriously organized themselves. The Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association – abbreviated as "Yinlian" – was born on January 22nd of this year.</p>
<p>The passive goal is, needless to say, to prevent us from becoming "accustomed to the smell and not noticing it" and living a drunken, dreamy life in this "safe haven." The active goal is to take "to contact and associate with emotion, exchange knowledge, improve amateur life, promote proper recreation, enhance service effectiveness, and promote banking business" as the purpose.</p>
<p>The organization of the association, under the General Meeting of Members, is equipped with a Council and a Board of Supervisors. Under the Standing Council, there are:</p>
<p>General Affairs, Membership, Academic, Service, Sports, Recreation, and Publication Departments, which are strictly divided and cooperated. There are many sections and groups under each department.</p>
<p>The scope of the association's activities is very wide, such as libraries, choir, drama troupe, lectures, banking accounting classes, English classes, travel, various sports training, and various patriotic movements. It abandons the habit of "living in comfort" and lives and learns in the collective, showing remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>The number of members of the association has increased to 900 now. Permanent members pay a one-time membership fee of more than HK$50, supporting members pay a monthly membership fee of more than one dollar and less than ten dollars, and ordinary members pay 30 cents per month. Therefore, the economic foundation of the association is quite solid. Banking giants such as Qian Xinzhi, Tang Shoumin, Ye Zhuotang, Yu Hongjun, Kong Lingkan, Liu Jisheng, Li Daonan, Huo Caibao, and Li Nangong either joined as permanent members of the association or fully expressed sympathy and provided assistance. The upper and lower levels are united, and the association has done very well in this regard. Many of the responsible cadres of the association are also originally responsible for important positions in the banking industry.</p>
<p>Facts tell us that many industry leaders are still narrow-minded and short-sighted, and are not satisfied with their subordinates participating in social or amateur activities. Therefore, many young professionals are concerned and hesitant. According to the person in charge of the association speaking to the reporter, "Yinlian" does not have this unfortunate fact. This is gratifying.</p>
<p>The association has recently established a magnificent clubhouse on the third floor of the Gold and Silver Exchange in Marsha Street, and held an opening ceremony on the 6th of this month, which was very grand. In order to connect feelings and enhance the unity of members, the association held its first General Meeting of Members the other night at the Confucius Hall. The entire building was full, with nearly a thousand people, mostly bank employees and their families. The atmosphere was very happy and lively. The cadres of the association, such as Wang Jiucheng, Feng Shumin, Jin Zhongtao, Chen Zhiluan, Wang Shucha, Chen Bin, and Fei Xingbo, were busy preparing for everything.</p>
<p>After 7 o'clock, the ceremony began. Chairman Feng Shumin delivered a speech, followed by recreational performances. The harmonica served as the prelude, and then the association's choir sang songs of national salvation.</p>
<p>"Cannot Return to Hometown," "The Flag is Flying," and "Eight Hundred Heroes" moved the audience. At the request of "One More Time," they sang it again, winning warm applause.</p>
<p>Then came the drama. The Yinlian Drama Troupe of the association performed two famous plays, "The Roar of the Ancient City" and "Mount Tai Feather," directed by Tang Huaiqiu, the head of the China Travel Troupe. Many friends from the China Travel Troupe helped with the set design, and the performance was quite remarkable. It lasted until midnight, and everyone left happily. The Yinlian Drama Troupe of the association also plans to hold a charity performance at the Entertainment Theatre in early next month, which will surely be a lively affair. The spirit of the association in actively seeking development under the possibilities of the environment is admirable.</p>
<p>At the end of the article, the reporter hopes that the employees of the industry will seize the opportunity and environment of this time and place and work hard. The motherland is in rebirth, and everything about us must also follow the rebirth!</p>
<h3 id="e46">China Relief Committee Donates 200,000 – Builds New Camp to Accommodate Isolated Army – Address Already Selected Near Kowloon Hospital – Isolated Army in Ma Tau Chung Will Move in After Completion <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The isolated army residing in the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp numbers thousands, and live together with the refugees in the camp. The authorities plan to find a local location to accommodate them, but due to limited funding and the lack of a suitable location, it has been unresolved for a long time. Our country's authorities, to provide the soldiers in the camp with more comfortable accommodation, have allocated 200,000 national currency from the Central Relief Committee for the construction of a new camp. The location of the camp has been selected at the intersection of Argyle Street and Livin Road, near Kowloon Hospital. The plans have been drawn up, and construction can begin once approved by the competent authorities. The construction method of the new camp will be the same as the current government refugee camp. Several wooden houses will be built in the camp, the ground will be paved with cement, and the camp will be surrounded by iron fences. The camp will accommodate approximately 1,000 to 1,200 people. In the future, after the construction is completed, the isolated army in the Ma Tau Chung camp will all move in, and the remaining empty houses will be used to accommodate approximately 1,000 homeless refugees. The wooden houses in the new camp can be used for ten to fifteen years. Once the war is over and the soldiers in the camp return to the country, the camp can be converted into residential housing, which can also solve some of the housing problems for the poor people in Hong Kong at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Dump Truck – Injures Mud Worker <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Near the Asia Petroleum Depot in Tsuen Wan, the Hong Kong Public Works Department is employing workers to level mountains and reclaim land, and has built a railway line for transporting mud to the seaside. At 10:30 yesterday morning, during a heavy rain, several mud workers were transporting mud and stones. At that time, one worker's hand slipped, causing the mud truck to break free and rush forward. Several mud workers could not escape in time and were hit by the truck. One person was seriously injured, and several others sustained minor injuries. The foreman, seeing this situation, immediately went to the Tsuen Wan Police Station to report the case. The police station then telephoned the Kowloon Fire Brigade to send a Red Cross team to transport the injured to Kowloon Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Civil Defense Training – Participants Are Very Enthusiastic <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>In order to implement the civil defense training program for the public, the Hong Kong Civil Defense Authorities are actively training civil defense personnel by holding Chinese and English civil defense classes in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon. According to Civil Defense Controller Stewart Percival Smith, since the opening of the civil defense classes, the public has been very enthusiastic in participating. The minimum number of Chinese and Western residents who have received civil defense training is over 25,000, with approximately 15,000 women and approximately 10,000 men. Regarding the selection and appointment of Chinese civil defense instructors, the candidates have not yet been decided. There are quite a few applicants, and the authorities will decide within this week. Smith mentioned the volunteer firefighters, saying that the recruitment results for the volunteer fire brigade are not good, probably because there has been too little publicity. It will be necessary to engage in expanded publicity in the short term. The number of volunteer firefighters planned to be recruited is 200, but currently only 23 people have applied. It will be necessary to find a way to recruit 100 people in the future. Regarding the number of police officers who have received civil defense training, Smith said that all police officers have already received civil defense training.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Medical Director Talks – Cholera Prevention is Imminent – 72 Cases Occurred up to Last Friday <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Planning to Implement Free Microbe Testing – And Discussing Methods with the Medical Community</p>
<p>Cholera is the most severe epidemic in summer. Last year, it was prevalent in Hong Kong, and countless residents died from this disease. In view of the tragic cholera epidemic last year, the Hong Kong Health Authorities have been actively implementing various preventive methods since the arrival of this summer, such as holding free epidemic prevention injections and broadcasting lectures and propaganda. The authorities are not slackening their efforts. According to Medical Director S.Y. Sik yesterday, as of last Friday evening, a total of 72 cases of cholera have occurred in Hong Kong this year. For the purpose of further epidemic prevention, the medical authorities are now planning to implement free testing of microbes. If a government doctor hears of a patient who has suspected microbe material but the patient is unable to pay the testing fee, it can be processed for free. Regarding the broadcasting of propaganda on prevention methods, English broadcasts will be held again. For the Cantonese broadcasts, it has been scheduled for Mr. Ho Kam Tong to broadcast at 8:00 PM next Wednesday, explaining methods to prevent cholera. In order to promote widespread publicity, the authorities are now planning to create wall posters in public places, instructing the source of cholera transmission and its prevention methods. This mural is needed for residents of Hong Kong who cannot read. Sik continued that the authorities have recently vigorously promoted epidemic prevention injections and have received assistance from all sectors of society.

<p>Hong Kong Police Station, up on the mountain, at Sam Yau Shan Hang, continuous days of rain have resulted in pooled water.  It is said the depth is over ten feet.  Around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, four children, including Cheng Niu (12 years old), were playing near the dike.  Unexpectedly, Cheng, in his excitement, lost his footing and disappeared into the water.  The other young and ignorant children did not know how to help and fled in all directions.  Cheng tragically drowned.  After some time, Cheng's family noticed he hadn't returned home for a long time and began searching everywhere.  They then questioned the children who had been playing with Cheng and learned that he had drowned in the water.  They rushed to the ditch to rescue him, and after searching, they found him, but he had already been dead for a long time. The boy's parents were heartbroken by his tragic death and wept bitterly. They reported it to the police station, which sent a hearse to take the body to the morgue.  Unexpectedly, while this matter was still causing an uproar, another woman said her son was also missing, and he had also been playing with Cheng at the same location.  The police suspected that the child had suffered the same fate as Cheng and drowned in the water.  They continued to search the water for a long time but found nothing. The assistant superintendent of the station filed the case for further investigation.</p>

<p>(Shenzhen Quick News) Our East River army is taking a two-pronged approach, military and political, to attack the Japanese. Besides using guerrilla tactics to harass the Japanese army, they are also blockading the occupied areas to cut off supplies to the Japanese army. All these measures are yielding considerable results. The recent measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Establishment of Joint Defense Zones in the Third and Fourth Districts</p>
<p>Luo Fengxiang, commander of the Third District Guerrilla Column, and Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla Column, recognizing that their territories are connected and closely related, have decided to establish a joint defense zone to enhance their power to kill the Japanese and consolidate the security of the rear area. The aim is to facilitate communication and mutual assistance to form a united front. Wang Ruozhou discussed the joint defense measures with Luo Fengxiang during a trip to the city, and preparations are expected to be completed soon for the official establishment.  From then on, the effectiveness of the East River guerrillas will become more apparent.</p>
<p>Formulation of Prohibited Goods to Prevent Aiding the Japanese</p>
<p>The Third and Fourth Districts have further defined the categories of prohibited goods to prevent criminals from smuggling goods to aid the Japanese. The districts have instructed their subordinates to comply with these regulations. The prohibited goods are as follows: Electrical materials and accessories (all kinds of metal ores, sands and their manufactured products, and old waste manufactured products), kerosene, gasoline, coal, charcoal, lubricating oil, lime, bricks, tiles, cement, clay, durable clay, magnesite, dolomite, nitrate bricks, acid fluoride stone, alum, gypsum, mineral products, arsenic ore and its products, all kinds of poultry, hides, animal fur, fresh and frozen meats (pork, beef, casings), salted eggs, rice, wheat, grains, beans, flour, bran, miscellaneous grains (including buckwheat, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro, etc.), tung oil, raw lacquer, tea, silk and its products, hemp and its products, bamboo and wood materials, seaweed, rosin, dried chili, cotton and its products, taro slices, variegated taro, alcohol dyes, paper, scallions, cinnamon. All the above items are strictly prohibited from being used to aid the Japanese, and violators will be severely punished.</p>

<p>(Shantou Quick News) Because of Shantou's geographically important coastal location, there is a possibility of attacks. The Guangdong authorities are paying close attention to the defense of Shantou.  The mayor of Shantou, Wu Qi, recently submitted a request to the provincial government to resign, which was approved by the provincial government council.  Given the recent gathering of Japanese warships in the Lingdong area and the particularly tense situation, and although Commander Hua Zhenzhong is responsible for the security of Chaozhou and Shantou, it is still necessary to select a military expert to be stationed in Shantou to ensure complete security. Therefore, it was decided to appoint Luo Xianxiang as the mayor of Shantou. Luo was formerly the director of the Military Affairs Department of the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office and the chief of staff of the military district. He is familiar with military affairs and well-acquainted with the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou.  In order to avoid the vacancy in the mayor's office being prolonged, Li Zhongxi has ordered Luo to proceed to Shantou to take office quickly. The incumbent mayor of Shantou, Wu Qi, is also a capable political figure, and to make the best use of his talents, he has been specially transferred to be the magistrate of Chao'an County. Liang Hanzhao, the former magistrate of Chao'an County, has been transferred to an important position in the Fourth War Zone.</p>
<h3 id="e55">China Youth Relief Association Held General Meeting Yesterday; Pan Zhu Reports on the Service Team's Return to China <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The China Youth Relief Association held its eighth general meeting at its new location on Caine Road at 3 PM yesterday to discuss amendments to the constitution and important resolutions. Dozens of members attended. After the formalities, Chairman Huang Zonghao gave an opening speech, followed by discussion of various proposals. Members suggested that since the association had moved to its new location, all aspects of its organization and planning should be greatly refreshed. They noted that the association's membership fees and funds had not been actively collected.  To facilitate the progress of the work, they specifically appointed Lu Baolian, the director of finance, and Huang Xiuming, the deputy director, to sign and seal letters to all members, requesting them to pay their monthly membership fees and funds to strengthen the association's foundation. After the resolution was passed, Pan Zhu, who had just returned from Dongjiang, reported on the arrival of the association's first service team at its destination in Dongjiang. He stated that the team departed on May 14 and passed through Pingshan, Danshui, Huiyang, and other places.  Due to transportation difficulties, it took them seven days of hardship to reach Boluo, their destination, and 25 days to complete the deployment.  They have now begun to promote various projects.  The terrain of Dongjiang is mostly mountainous, making it suitable for guerrilla warfare. It is also rich in resources, and the people are self-sufficient. The people have strong military strength, and many possess hidden firearms. If they can be organized, a vast people's self-defense army can be formed. Since the outbreak of the South China War, the local people have suffered greatly under Japanese oppression, and their desire for revenge is even stronger. Many Dongjiang people reside abroad, and overseas Chinese are fervently patriotic. Since the outbreak of the war, many overseas Chinese from Huizhou have returned to serve their country.  Boluo has a population of about 200,000. During the war, it suffered the most severe damage under Japanese oppression. The county seat was almost completely destroyed, and many other villages were also damaged.  Now, order is gradually being restored. The cultural level in Dongjiang is extremely low, and mass movements are not yet on track.  Currently, local military, political, party, and service groups are paying attention to this and making extensive efforts to promote progress, and considerable achievements have been made. Currently, the groups leading the mass movement work in the various counties of Dongjiang include the Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Compatriots Service Corps, which has established a total of seven corps headquarters. The first corps in Huizhou has over a hundred people working, the second corps is in Haijifeng, the third corps is in Boluo, the fourth corps is in Zijin, the fifth corps is in Heyuan, the sixth corps is in Biaochuan, and the seventh corps is in Heping. The other two teams and the recently returned all-female Vincent Team are operating behind Japanese lines in Zengcheng and Bao'an.  Next are the Vanguard Team and the Dongjiang District Team, whose members are scattered throughout the counties and villages of Dongjiang, carrying out mobile work. In addition, there is the wartime work corps organized by the Boluo County government, which has achieved exceptionally good results.</p>

<p>(Yangjiang Quick News) Banditry was rampant in the second, third, eighth, and ninth districts of Yangjiang, causing harm to the local area. Since County Magistrate Chen took office, he has led his troops to suppress them vigorously. The bandits dispersed and were unable to maintain their livelihoods. Recently, they sent representatives to surrender to the county government. County Magistrate Chen, with righteous persuasion, reorganized them into a self-defense corps to defend the country and resist the Japanese. Yesterday, officials were sent to inspect and organize them into a company to assist in consolidating local security.</p>

<p>(Wuzhou Quick News) Guangxi Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu is making great efforts to develop wartime production. Since the establishment of the Guangxi Provincial Local Construction Cadre School, he has been planning to open up a land reclamation zone for production in Liuzhou to provide relief to refugees and increase production. In addition to the preferential investment and land reclamation regulations promulgated by the provincial government to encourage people to invest in industries, he is also engaged in expanding the production area in Liuzhou to increase wartime food supplies. Huang Ronghua, director of the Guangxi Provincial Food Administration Bureau, has been dispatched to inspect and intensify the progress in various counties of the Liuzhou district.</p>

<p>(Zhongshan Quick News) Japanese troops are coveting the southern part of Xinhui County and have repeatedly attempted to invade Muzhou. Now, residents in the tenth, eighth, and ninth districts of the county, due to the intensified harassment of the waterways by the Japanese puppets, have been separately evacuating people and property in recent days. Women and children in Gujing, Meige, Sanjiang, and Yaxi have also been evacuating to avoid Japanese oppression.</p>

<p>(Qujiang Quick News) The recent important work of the Department of Finance includes: (1) Taking over the documents and public property transferred from the Guangdong Finance Commissioner's Office. Since the Guangdong Finance Commissioner's Office was ordered to close, all managed public property, documents, and cases of advance pension funds have been listed and transferred. The Department of Finance took over the handling of the pension cases and continued to process them. The remaining documents and public property have been checked against the list and stored separately. (2) Adjusting the county tax collection agencies. The temporary land tax collection offices, collection offices, and county tax collection offices were established separately, resulting in inconsistent authority, high costs, and inconvenient supervision. To centralize authority, coordinate expenses, and improve the tax collection system and efficiency, the original temporary land tax collection offices, collection offices, and county tax collection offices will be merged and reorganized into tax collection offices, scheduled to be implemented on July 1 of this year and submitted to the provincial government for review. (3) Preparing for the publication of a Tax Affairs Bulletin. The Department of Finance is actively promoting wartime policies. To improve the efficiency of tax administration and facilitate communication among tax agencies to achieve the goal of rectifying tax affairs, a Tax Affairs Bulletin is being prepared for publication on a regular basis. (4) Drafting essential regulations for the duties of tax bureau chiefs. Rectifying tax administration requires prioritizing the revitalization of the service spirit. It has been found that some tax bureau chiefs occasionally leave their posts without authorization, and newly appointed chiefs often fail to take office promptly, resulting in a lack of responsible personnel for tax work and affecting tax revenue. Strict rectification is urgently needed to emphasize duty. Regulations on the duties of tax bureau chiefs are being drafted for evaluation. (5) Announcing measures for tax exemption in disaster-stricken counties in war zones. The Department of Finance, in accordance with the order of the provincial government and the consultation of the Ministry of Finance, has formulated the second phase of the wartime administrative plan, implementing specific solutions and adjusting local wartime finance measures. Regarding the first measure, the Department of Finance has drafted measures for tax exemption in disaster-stricken areas and counties, which have been submitted to the provincial government for amendment and approval and ordered to be followed by all subordinate units.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended for two sessions due to the current situation. However, both the Hong Kong and Shanghai Football Associations hope that the next session (1939-1940) can be resumed.</p>
<p>At the same time, both associations are busy amending the regulations for interport football to increase public interest. The most important discussion for both sides is whether players who are employed in Guangzhou or Macau but whose families reside in Hong Kong can still represent Hong Kong, and whether it is reasonable for naval players who participate in Hong Kong league matches but cannot be selected for interport matches. Both sides are currently considering these issues and hope to reach a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>Recently, the Hong Kong Football Association presented a set of draft football regulations to the Shanghai Football Association for discussion. However, it did not mention the proposal to temporarily suspend the interport matches due to the current situation. The Shanghai Football Association, wanting to resume the interport matches as soon as possible, has accepted most of Hong Kong's proposals. The important rules that need to be amended by both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The annual "Interport Cup" should be held in Hong Kong and Shanghai in rotation. This cup is limited to competition between the Hong Kong and Shanghai teams. (Previously, Tianjin also participated).</p>
<p>(2) Players recognized or registered by the Hong Kong and Shanghai associations can be selected as interport players, regardless of their residency status.</p>
<p>(3) Each port can only select three military personnel, including naval players employed on ships at sea.</p>
<p>Other rules that need to be amended include a proposal on how to resolve ties in interport matches.</p>
<p>The Shanghai side has proposed adding 30 minutes of extra time. It is not yet certain whether the Hong Kong side will agree, but most committee members support adding 20 minutes of extra time.</p>
<p>The above amendments have not yet been finalized and will likely be decided before the start of the next football season.</p>

<p>Two games in the Shenbao Cup Women's Charity Basketball Tournament are scheduled for tonight. The first game is at 7 PM, with Zhonghua vs. Southwest. The second game is at 8 PM, with Zhixing vs. Huaxiong. The strengths of the two teams in the first game are fairly balanced. The former is a newly formed team with strong players such as Liu Shouguang, Yu Shangying, and Rao Huizhen. Southwest is also strong, with players such as Zhu Zhixian and Wu Ruixin, who are among the best in the army. This match is expected to be fierce. Zhixing in the last game is a strong team in Hong Kong and is comparable to this year's champion, Meifang. Although Huaxiong is a new team, its fighting spirit is very good and should not be underestimated. This battle is also expected to be very interesting. The player rosters for the four teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Zhonghua) Li Chunyu, Zhang Runlan, Yu Shangying, Rao Huizhen, Rao Huifen, Liu Shouguang, Yang Yuqiong, Mu Zhen, Cui Li, He Jingxiong, Rong Xianhong, Rong Meikui,</p>

<p>— A Precious History of Sports —</p>
<p>Athens</p>
<p>Education in Athens was also focused on martial arts, but not to the extreme like Sparta. Because Sparta was located in a mountainous area, its nature was stubborn and unyielding. Athens, occupying the eastern gateway of Greece, with convenient transportation and thriving commerce, naturally had literary cultivation, musical interests, and social enjoyment. In the sixth century BC, Athens also produced a great man named Salon, who, seeing the different residents in various mountains, plains, and coasts, often had many disputes. Therefore, he specially stipulated a constitution.</p>
<p>(1) Education of Children: Children were entrusted to wet nurses for care after birth and were also subject to national inspection. The right to abandon them was transferred to the parents. Before the age of six, they spent their lives on their mothers' laps. The methods of playing were already practiced with many variations. We can still discover the relics passed down from them. Reading, arithmetic, music, and gymnastics were equally emphasized because the aim of the Athenian educational method was the completion and harmony of the individual. School education was only a private obligation. How far national education should reach was determined by the family's wealth and the father's will. However, the person responsible for direct education was also a tutor with the status of a slave. These tutors were often failed refugees, and their character was not questioned, and their pay was not fixed. According to the constitution, at the age of seven, children entered wrestling schools to practice gymnastics, music, and dance in preparation for the sacrifices at the shrine. After the age of eighteen, musical practice ceased, but gymnastics continued. Although the focus of gymnastics was on national defense, it also paid attention to balanced development. Salon's legislation emphasized that music was for promoting the spirit and gymnastics for developing the body. Therefore, later generations referred to Sparta as a martial arts education and Athens as a literary education. In fact, Athens was not without martial arts; it was just not as extreme as Sparta.</p>
<p>(2) Educational Institutions: The educational institutions in Greece were gymnasiums. Therefore, we can also say that Greek education was physical education. In the beginning, there were no complete gymnasiums, but rather simple and rustic markets and coasts. Later, they paid attention to the construction of physical education. The place for young wrestlers and boxers was called Palaestra, and the place for adults was called Gymnosia. Now, I will explain Platon's description of the construction of Gymnosia. Gymnasia were gymnastics fields for young people, with steam baths that were open to the public. There were dressing rooms called Apoduterion, oil application at the beginning of exercise called Claiothe, a place for rubbing with sand called Konisterion, a ball game field called Sphairlsterion, and a wrestling field called Xusioi. In short, the Greek Gymnasia were social gathering places for young people and adults over the age of eighteen. Famous places include Luksion Geum Kunassnges AeademeRlolenaoion, all of which have Gymnasia buildings. Because there were lecture halls, conversation rooms, and nursing rooms, they were actually clubs for Athenians. The etymology of schools in modern Europe mostly comes from this. The German high school is called Gymnasimn, and the French middle school is called Lycee as an example.</p>
<p>(3) Teachers: The teachers in the Athenian Gymnatsla had the following distinctions:</p>
<p>(A) Gymnastai were responsible for the general development and training of the body, equivalent to modern gymnastics teachers. (B) Pritolribai only taught sports methods, equivalent to modern competitive teachers. (C) Sophroncolai taught moral character, equivalent to modern ethics teachers. (D) Gyionnasiarchos was in charge of the whole, equivalent to modern principals.</p>
<p>(4) Teaching Materials: In addition to physical education, there was a course in moral education. The physical education textbooks included running, high jump, wrestling, discus throwing, javelin throwing, and the technique of combining boxing and wrestling called Pankration. There was also swimming, bathing, and ball games. Some people think they have already invented the sport of rowing.</p>
<p>(5) Equipment: Although sports were flourishing, the equipment was very simple, just spears, irons, and frames for high jumping, and gloves for boxing. (Three)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Baseball Field Conversations Among Baseball People <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Arguments can serve as explanations of baseball rules; humor provides after-meal amusement.</p>
<p>During the plum rain season, rainfall is abundant, and it so happens that every time the public baseball league is about to begin, the rain pours down, reducing the enthusiasm of players and spectators to zero.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two good games were just about to start when the rain forced a stop; however, although the games didn't happen, the people sheltering from the rain inside the field were packed tightly. "Old White Beard" Smith, wearing an American wide-brimmed cowboy hat, along with Hong Kong Club players Walker and Modun, Little Smith (also the baseball reporter for the South China Morning Post and the Hong Kong Club's second baseman), football star Li An'na, Western Club pitcher Palazi, South China Club's Wu Zhenbang, and others, gathered in a corner, talking and laughing.</p>
<p>During the conversation, Li An'na steered the topic towards baseball rules, questioning Little Smith, saying he had incorrectly recorded an "error" against him last Saturday. Little Smith replied, "You had two errors that day. One was when your opponent hit a fly ball, and you rushed forward to catch it, but your handwork wasn't smooth, and the ball slipped out of your glove and onto the ground. That's an error." Li An'na then retorted, "At that time, I was more than ten yards away from the ball's landing point, and I ran over at full speed. Before I could even steady myself, I reached out to catch the ball. The ball touched my fingertips and then slipped to the ground. That shouldn't be counted as an error." Little Smith said, "That ball clearly fell from your palm. How can that not be an error?"</p>
<p>Standing in front of Little Smith, Modun poked Smith's chest and interjected, "Your records are often unfair. I've suffered from your inaccuracies too." Little Smith, with a grin, asked, "How have you suffered?" Modun said sternly, "Last time, I caught a ball, and you still recorded an error. You need to know the definition of an error. It refers to delays, missed catches, and wild throws. Logically, if a player does their best within their ability, it shouldn't be counted as an error. For example, if a batter hits a ball that goes through the gap between the third baseman and the shortstop, and the runner gets a chance to reach first base, is that an error?" Little Smith quickly replied, "Of course not an error; it's a hit." Modun's anger subsided slightly, while Old White Beard remained silent on the sidelines, not taking sides.</p>
<p>Wu Zhenbang then told the reporter: Arguing about baseball is the most interesting and complex part of the game. Players must not only have agile bodies but also clear minds, quick hands and eyes, and courage and strategy to become successful players. Although the rules of the game are complex and difficult to understand, once you read them thoroughly and know how to apply them, you will feel the strictness and fun within them. For example, if there are runners on first and second base, or first, second, and third base, before two outs, and the batter hits an easily catchable fly ball to the infield, once the umpire announces "infield fly," whether the ball is caught or not, the batter is out. This rule protects the attacking side, preventing the game from becoming monotonous. If the umpire deems it not an "infield fly," then the fielders can pass the ball to each other to execute a "double play" or "triple play." Old Wu also said, "Our team's pitcher, Li Zhongzhen, is an engineer. He recently received an invitation from Chongqing and has already taken the route through Haiphong to take up his position. As a result, the South China team has lost another good player. Fortunately, the fierce general Zheng Biao is determined to join the military and will make an appearance this weekend."</p>
<p>The rain stopped slightly, and everyone went home. Hong Kong Club catcher Walker, in a humorous tone, pretending to be a baseball field recorder, shouted the slogan "No Run, No Hit, No Error," and then went down the hill. Only Walker with "No Run, No Hit, No Error," implying no ball game, made everyone laugh.</p>
