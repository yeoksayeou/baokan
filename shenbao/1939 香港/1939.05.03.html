<h3>菲律濱民眾公意的反映　獨立，民主，和平新政策</h3>
<p>— 菲律賓加巴都舍：（G．Capadocia）作</p>
<p>菲律賓獨立問題，目前各方面又在爭　　，人民大眾對這一問題有着　然不　的見解，有的主張立卽完全獨立，有的主張自治　土形式，有的主張擴大自治共和國，菲律濱人民的幸福，興旺，國家的安全就决定在這一問題上，菲律濱共產黨爲要充分表白其對于這一問題的立場，期望每一個菲律濱人民均能了解幷接納爲他們自己的意見，</p>
<p>一　民主與法西斯</p>
<p>我們不能够將我們國家的運命與整個人類的　命分開，因爲在今日的世界是分成兩條主要陣綫在鬥爭着，瘋狂的法西斯軍閥侵略者正在從事對愛好民主，愛好和平的人民進攻，意大利已經侵佔亞比亞尼亞，而且正在進行侵略西班牙共知國的戰爭；日本攫取了滿州以後，又在進行征　整個中國的戰爭，威脅着整個亞洲與馬來人民的自治與和平。日，德，意是戰爭製造者，企圖毀滅幾世紀以來人類的一切進步。</p>
<p>與法西斯對抗的是民主與和平力量，全世界愛好和平的人民有着制止侵略保衞和平爲民主掃淸一條發的道路的光榮歷史使命，可敬的西班牙共和國的人民，正在堅决地與他們國內那些出賣國家接受德意法西斯侵略者帮助的暴徒，作英勇戰爭，而中國的民衆也同時正在爲他們的民族生存，爲我們的民主與獨立整作同樣的英勇的抗戰。目前擺在整個人類的面前，是民主與法西斯對抗，和平與戰爭對抗，進步與反動對抗，改以發展我們的民主，保正我們的國家安全與人民的福利，完成國家的完全獨立是與整個世界民主對抗法西斯的鬥爭分不開的。</p>
<p>我國也難免受法西斯國家的陰謀與侵略的威脅，佛朗哥的黨徒同時也就是西班牙在菲律濱最大的壟斷者，正在自由地組織援助西班牙國內的叛徒，同時在菲律濱樹立法西期組織。自從東京羅馬與柏林的同盟成立以後，無疑地佛朗哥的黨徒也與這三個法西斯國家的走狗勾結在一起企圖毀滅我自治共和國。</p>
<p>如我們不認淸我們是處在日平法西斯侵略的下面，那末，我們首先就會陷於民埃自殺的危險，因爲日本法西斯與德意法西斯勾結以後，正在準備新的世界大戰摧毀世界民主，而結果他會容易地使菲律濱作　他的軍事根据地以侵略遠東其他的民族。日本的戰艦及間課正在太平洋沿岸及各海峽地帶，肆活動，日本駐重兵於台灣，近接菲律濱的北部。他的海軍與空軍直接控制菲律濱與香港新加坡的交通，他的空軍可以自委任乃續侵入菲律濱羣島，而且已經侵入荷蘭東印度波羅洲，日本的官史儼然以菲律濱的主人翁自居，以驕傲的態度對待菲律濱政府與人民，猶如他們對待中國政府與人民一樣，而東京也曾幾次的以可怕的運命威脅菲律濱，要是我們有任何運動反對日本帝國主義在菲律濱的利益，他們外交官用强硬的態度干涉菲律濱內政，甚至限制我們的民主權利，要求禁止我們同情與援助英勇的中國兄弟的運動。日本巳儼然以有權力的菲律濱主人翁自居，只待時機一至勾結菲律濱叛逆就能够使菲律濱成爲滿州高麗，台灣的第二。</p>
<p>所以我們不能忽視這種對國家獨立與安全的絕大威脅，因爲我們對於我們的人民與世界民主要負着絕大實任。百年來的爲自由而鬥爭，與西班牙暴君及美帝國主義的英勇鬥爭，爲恢復國家主權的鬥爭，爲獲得更多政冶上的自由門爭，以及爲求國家及早獨立的鬥爭，要求我們繼續這種鬥爭的精神直到達到完全自由解放。革命先烈布哥士。黎　，文尼巴壽，侖那要求我們繼續為自由與民主而作持久的鬥爭。菲律濱共產黨一向崇拜這些爲求獨立而犧牲的革命先烈，認爲共同的任務是非常神聖，不能讓不負責任的冒險念頭混進獨立運動中，菲律濱人民應該採取適當步驟，保證能够保　自己，保衞民族，不爲日本侵略，增强世界民主力量，使家國的獨立基於民主與安全上面，以抵禦外來的侵略。</p>
<p>二　真正的有保證的獨立</p>
<p>菲律濱共產黨認為菲律濱人民不能隨便放棄他們的自决權利與獨立自主權利，因爲這些權利是菲律濱人民經長期英勇堅決鬥爭方被承認的。美國進步政府在獨立案上明白承認菲律濱在一九四六年完全獨立，經過菲律濱　民投票同意，這是我們的勝利，所以我們應盡最大熱誠加以保衛。因爲很明　地這獨立權利已安到法西斯侵略者的威脅。我們應該盡最大的力量來保衞這些權利作發將來達到民主獨立的完全勝利的先决條件。我們能不能保持獨　權利。能不能獲得自由，不能靠日本法西斯軍閥及其同盟，而是要與世界民主國家切實合作。脫離美國而獨立。幷不規定我們立刻與他割斷一切關係，菲律濱人民是否完全獨立，或是等到一九四六年，要爲我們所處的特別國　環境來决定。要是等到一九四六年才完全脫離美國而獨立或者更有保證，而在目前的環境之下，立刻完全脫離美國一切關係，幷不能對民衆保證更充分民主與真正完全獨立。要是立刻與美國脫離一切關係，就是等於拋棄太平洋最大民主國家之一，使國家的獨立，和平與安令遭受嚴重的打擊，菲律濱人民的福利是基於與美國及其他的進步勢力與愛好民主的人民合作，而不是要討好那些企圖侵略菲律濱的法西斯的。</p>
<p>菲律濱人民大衆的傳統，渴望自由就是民主的力量；也是要當心那種無原則的犧牲一切代價要立刻完全獨立的主張。這樣主張的人們，不管他們是無知的，或是法西斯的無知工具，總是在鼓動我們盲目地割斷與美國一切關係。法西斯强盜最　在其所要侵略的國家民族內造內亂，分裂民衆，與利他的侵略。在菲律濱的這些日本法西斯工具，在『亞洲是亞洲人的亞洲一的口號掩飾之下，利用菲律濱人渴望自由，　虛爲宣傳日本法西斯是自由解放者。但是菲律濱人民是不會而且也不願上這種危險宣傳的大當，門爲　種危險宣傳巳經奴隸了東亞　個民族，而且是在繼續進行着征服整個亞洲的陰謀。在菲律濱人民大衆中做這樣宣傳的人們，是受日本法西斯的族使以破壞及反對菲律濱自治共和國與美國，他們所演的角色正如德國法西斯在奧國的工具所演的一樣，使德國得合併奧國，菲律濱這些法西新工具是出賣菲律濱獨立　動的爲逆，是菲律濱人民的公敵，他們這種出賣獨立行爲倘若不加制止，會將菲律濱人民大衆出賣給統治日本的法西斯軍閥，而在其鉄蹄下過牛馬生活。</p>
<p>同時，菲律濱共產黨反對長期受美國的束縛，美國在菲列濱的專利者，在幾個菲律濱糖商及其他商人的支持，與美國的利益結在一起，正在利用匪律濱所處的實際環境，力勸菲律濱人民長期受美國統治。但是目前主要問題不是立刻獨對抗美國是長期統治，而是保立民主國家的安全對抗法西斯軍閥侵略，因此，我們認爲在目前國內與國際的反動勢力的壓迫之下，菲律濱人民沒有理由或需要一味鬧着立刻獨立自主，擴大自治共和國，與美國長期統治等問題，在目前的環境之下，在獨立法案下面，我們盡可求得人民的福利，保衛與擴大民主的權利以及求得　日實現國家的完全獨立，因此我們竭力保衞這些規定的獨立法案，以及共和國憲　程面的已得權利：一個民主共和國　政體。一個比我們過去所享受的較高度的自治政府，承認國家獨立權利。我們應該竭力保衛這些權利反對國內的法西斯份子及外來的侵略者的干涉，我們竭力保存國家的財富不爲專利者掠奪，保衛幷且發展我們資源與工業。</p>
<p>同時，在獨立法案實施以前我們應該努力擴大民主政治求得　充分的自治。事實上美菲兩國的民主關係愈是　展，則愈能使兩國間的人民友　地自願地合作起來，就在目前的關係下面也可能獲得更充分自治，求得菲律濱人民的福利。求得菲律濱籍民在夏威夷及美國與美國人有同等權利，假如到了修改獨立法案內時期，菲律濱共產黨將鼓勵菲律濱人民建立　　濱獨立民主共和國，爲着互相間的自衛·互助·爲着商務上互惠　與英國訂　政治上的友愛條約，關於這一點菲律濱人民可以公民投票未决定，這樣可以享受充份的權利。</p>
<p>三　為和平與民主反對法西斯與戰爭而鬥爭</p>
<p>我們的自由問題是不能和戰爭與和平的問題分開的，我們不忍看我們的城市及鄉村受法西斯侵略者的野蠻的燒殺，猶如內班牙的圭爾加，巴樂倫那。馬德里，上海，南京，厦門，廣州，那樣的燒殺。有些人們吿訴我們說，我們若繼續與美國維持　樣的關係，菲律濱會成爲×人進攻的目標而變成戰場。這樣，若　他們意見立刻和完全獨立，會保證我們中立，不致引入衝突的漩渦。難道他們眞的相信日本法西斯不會馬上攫取菲律濱作爲侵略中國，荷屬東印度，印度支那，及美國的根据地嗎？難道他們不是喪心病狂認爲菲律濱人民會毫無抵抗地就屈服在日本法西期軍閥的鐵蹄下面嗎？我們要對他們保證菲律濱人民會英勇地與法西斯侵略者作堅决的戰鬥，猶如他們過去爲自由而鬥爭的一樣，而且是站在民主與進步方面來與反動的法西斯作堅决的戰鬥。</p>
<p>雖然現在還可以避免法西斯軍閥正在準備或已發動的世界大戰，但是避免的方法不是一味屈服在他的威脅與侵略下面、而是應該積極地予侵略者以嚴重的打擊。中國過去就是一味屈服在日本法西斯的威脅與侵略之下，夢想犧牲一切求得妥洽，結果喪失滿州，造成日本在華北的統治地位，繼續對中國民衆提出無理的要求。只有以國共合作基礎的統一戰線形成中國民眾的大團結，才有了强有力的抵抗，使日本每進一步都要付極大的代價，而且使他遭受了好幾次的大慘敗，在世界面前表現了中國民眾的英勇戰鬥精神，使世界人士深信最後勝利是屬於中國的。</p>
<p>保衛與恢復和平的康莊大道就是集體的安全制度，各國愛好和平的人民合作共同制裁戰爭禍首。法西斯軍閥其所以敢這樣任意暴行是由於民主國家的　　不决，動搖不定，不能及時予侵略者以集股的制裁，但是名民主國家的人民，尤其是美國的民衆急切地要求政府採取集體安全的政策以制裁侵略者，美國總統在一九三七年十月五日的演講中也聲言過全菲律濱的民衆應該與這　民主國家的民衆們一起共同　護與推促安全制度以制裁法西斯侵略者。</p>
<p>在美國孤立主義者中會發現那種反對進步派的反動勢力幷非偶然的，不足驚奇，猶如弁菲律濱人民中間有一部份人在大聲疾呼立刻完全脫離美國的關係而獨立是一樣不是偶然的，譬如衆議員烏馬利，就是努力在演着一個反對帝國主義者大聲疾呼菲律濱立刻幷採取孤立政策。參議員　陣堡，共和黨中最反動的領袖，壟斷資本的大資本家代言人，總是反對每一種對民衆有利的新的政策，也是要求菲律濱立刻完全獨立；大商業家的代言人胡佛，假裝着煽動家的關心民主與自由，以掩飾其法西斯的面目，攻擊羅斯福爲獨裁，同時在美國與進步勢力鬥爭時盡量帮助法西期勢力向民主勢力作野蠻的進攻。美國這些反動的法西斯份子，壟斷家，大商業家劇烈地掠奪美國人民的民主的權利，和生活水平，同時就是阻碍美國對外採取集龍安全的政策的阻力。這些份子就是當我們爲獨立與西班牙進行革命戰爭節節勝利時進兵　取我們的國家的主腦美國總統麥金利及帝國主義者的承繼者。也就是這些份子勾結　斯軍閥縱容日德意法西斯走狗，違背美國絕大多數人民的意志與願望，夢想法西斯主義　勝利。同時也就是這些最反動的份子竭力煽動菲律濱人民在目前脫離美國一切關係而獨立，藉此爲理由冉要求其政府退出　東拒絕與各民主國家建立集體安全制度一致行動。</p>
<p>另一方面，在美國的求改進人民生活條件的勞工運動，以及保衛民主反法西斯及壟斷者的民主運動，都擁護羅斯福總統的進步政策同時要求其加强集體安全政策的力量以打擊戰爭的禍首，這些民衆始終忠於美國民主，繼續美國人民黨及反帝同盟的任務，當麥　利出兵攻佔菲律濱時，　們就　我們要　獨立。在西半球諸民主國——加拿大，美國，墨西哥，以及拉丁美洲諸國——的愛好民主的人民已經團　起來爲和平民主與安全與這些國　內的法西斯份子，及國外法西斯國家的陰謀者鬥爭·羅斯福的親鄰政策是爲要使美國與這些國家更友好的關係·巳經爲遭此國家的人民接受而施行以對抗反動的法西斯，菲律濱人民巳直接受着日本法西斯軍閥屠段的威脅，爲　保衛國家的自治，保證將來的獨立與安全，應該由西半球的民主國家的民衆結成民主陣綫。</p>
<p>民主的運命與獨立運動是與廣大民衆的一切迫切需求分不開的，正如爲自由而奮鬥與爲改進人民生活條件而奮鬥是分不開的一樣，所以充分的民主應該予人民以要求生活改善而鬥爭權利，人民一經有了充分自由以進行改　生活的鬥爭民主力量也就會加强起來。因此政府對民眾運動不應虛　加以禁止，而是應該加以鼓勵並給予實　扶助。因爲鑲衆運動的普遍，最能保證民主，保衛國家的安全，建立自出的民主共和國。</p>
<p>我們正在努力追求自由發展民主政洽機構，可是法西斯及冒險者以親日份子竭力企圖加以危害。這些親日份子與弗朗哥黨徒及支持者，美國在菲律濱的有法西斯傾向　壟斷家。以及一部份菲律濱反動份了互相勾結威脅毀滅菲律濱民主·迫使菲律濱自殺地與世界反動勢力結合，同時藉菲律濱獨立問題以打擊進步的與民主的勢力。</p>
<p>菲律濱共產　明白指出目前的主要問電是民主對抗法西斯的問題，我們宣誓要站在民衆的前面，盡一切最大力量來保衛民主，消滅企圖危害它的反動勢力。</p>
<p>爲達到這一保衛與發展民主，促進獨立的運動的目的　菲律　共產黨認爲需要一個全民　的組織，以保衞菲律　自治共和國反對侵略者，這是為要達到一個具有完全主權的獨立國家的必要步驟，我們的國防建設應該是與民族工業建設同時幷進，所以國防建設只能依据經濟發展的水平，不然就會加重人民的負担。我們應該一面接受美國的技術的及其他的帮助，一面着重擁護集體安全制作爲制止侵略者保衛和平的有効方策。以這一方策與美國的民主的進步的勢力合作·更進一步與中國，荷屬東印度，法國，尤其是與願一切能力保　菲律濱安全的蘇聯合作，雖說菲律濱人民能英勇地與侵略者抗戰，但是，倘若我們與這些民主國家合作那未可以减少我們的犧牲，更容易地來保衞我們的自治共和國·只有那些孤立主義者，這是願意白白地將我們的國家斷送給日本帝國主義的人們才誇言菲律濱已經足以自亂，不易受進攻，這種說法是要蒙敝菲律濱人民，使其不覺當前的危險，而　棄集體安全的政策，假如我們真的照這些人的說法，認爲足以　　　採取孤立政策，那末會使菲律濱的安全遭遇到嚴重的危險，而且假若自治政府執行這種危險政策，結果只能是企圖建設其國力所不能負担的軍備、這是多未危險！</p>
<p>然而，在擁護國防建設，擁護集體安全制時，菲律濱共產黨特別指出國防負担不能加之於大衆的身上，在計順步統初上任時，國會就開始採取一切進得的步驟來修改課稅條文，雖然是進行總很慢，爲着國家的牧入，爲着人民的幸福，應該增加大公　遺產，及多入息者的課稅，而减少貧尼的負祖，</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>擁護抗戰與統一　——××濟南慘案十週年</h3>
<p>十年前的今天，是日本××主義開始武裝干涉中國革命與開始武裝進攻中國的日子。</p>
<p>十年前的今天，也是中華民族在親日派黃郛等屈辱求和的路線之下遭受恥辱的炮烙的日子。</p>
<p>民國十七年（一九二八年），國民革命軍克服臨城，進取濟南。日本田中內閣爲扶助封建軍閥與反動腐敗政權阻止中國革命復興勢力而達到其征服的企圖起見，立卽决議出兵山東。當派兵艦五十艘，陸軍五萬人，以福田爲指揮官。當四日廿九日，國民革命的北伐軍進抵濟南城，福田率領的千涉軍亦于這天趕到濟南與北伐軍對峙。到了五月三日，竟實行進攻北伐軍，並且屠殺市民和十兵。當時山東外交特派員蔡公時，因爲拒絕日方無理强求，慘遭毒刑拷打，並挖去目珠割去耳鼻，然後和交涉公署的十多個職員一齊槍殺。五月八日起，竟又實行總攻，到處搜查居民，搶刦財物，屠殺士兵，射擊行人，無辜市民被殺者達一萬以上。當時親日份子黃郛，在日軍壓迫下屈辱求和，答應日軍一切要求，勒令北伐軍撤到濟南。當時革命的軍人，雖曾聯合市內的工人和近郊的市民，反對屈辱條約，英勇抵抗日軍，終因彈盡援絕，於十一日在重大犧牲之下全部撤退。</p>
<p>從這一天以後，日本胆敢採取大規模的軍事行動，實行進攻中國，×××××，甚至累及在華外人及其法定權益。也從這一天以後，每一個中國人民開始認淸日本侵略者勾結中國封建軍閥賣國政客及一切反動勢力，而反對日×反對漢奸的怒潮亦開始在每一城市與鄕忖中汹湧起來。</p>
<p>但是因爲中國內部沒有統一，因爲中國親日份子妥協求和的政策沒有粉碎，尢其是因爲全中國人民沒有自動地積極地　反抗日×與漢奸而團結起來，所以十年以來，親日漢奸的逆流旣得暢行無阻，而日本××的鐵蹄則由山東省而東三省，由關外而深入我腹地，×××××，××××，一切慘絕人寰的令人不能置信的事變，便在我中華國土上不斷的演出，直到前年七月盧溝橋扣八月上海事變，直到國共兩黨宣言合作，全國致外禦强×，日×漢奸的×行，方才第一次遇到全面的堅决的抵抗。</p>
<p>十年後的今天，日本××的鐵蹄已經深入我北部中部南部各地，而日本××的轟炮×××××，則更巳使我全部美麗的山河錦綉的田園，新興的城市，陷入腥臭恐怖黑暗之中！我們在痛中思痛，深覺以下幾點的値得全國注意：</p>
<p>第一，我們要認淸日本侵略者之進攻，是早在十年以前就已决定的滅亡中國之計劃的實施，他們的對象是全部中國，是整個中華民族，是每一個不願做奴隸的中國人；　於日軍在五三慘案中之殘殺市民且屠戮蔡公時氏以圖消滅我民　反抗精神，卽可想見。因此我們今日必須加緊提高民族自尊心與自信心，動員全民　的生動力量，擁護中央領袖，加緊全國團結，堅持全民抗戰，爭取最後勝利。</p>
<p>第二，我們要認淸，日本侵略者是中華民族解放與復興運動的阻礙者，牠千方百計地打擊我們中國爭求獨立自由平等的革命運動和革命勢力。因爲我們愛國運動與革命勢力抬頭，則日本侵略者的行動便要受到制裁，所以他們更千方百計的來消滅我們的愛國運動和革命勢力，首先是打擊這種運動與勢力的領導者。在五三慘案當時是以「防止赤化」的口號來打擊國民黨的統一中國，在十年後的今日還是以『反共反蔣』的口號來破壞國共兩黨合作的統一戰線，因此我們今日必須加緊努力抵抗日本侵略者這種企圖，而且要增强我們內部的統一，要　展我們的愛國運動和革命勢力，首先是要充實與發展領導中國抗戰建國的國民黨和共產黨，要鞏固與擴六抗日民族統一戰線，祇有這樣，才是粉碎×人企圖的有效辦法。</p>
<p>第三，我們還要認淸日本侵略者在其破壞中國解放與復興運動之中，主要的策略，是用『以華制華』的政治陰謀，配合它的軍事准攻。××××當時，是日×運用政治軍事雙管齊下的毒策的開始，在富時一面以軍事力量協助封建軍閥與腐敗反動政權，一面以政冶陰謀利用革命陣線中的動搖妥協份子尤其是親日份子。在十年後的今天，！他不僅利用一切封建殘餘勢力，不僅利用一切中華民　的渣滓，落伍的軍閥官僚政客，並且正在利用革命抗日戰線上的動搖妥協份子，頑固守舊份子，自私自利份子，以及胸襟狹窄不識大體不顧全局的份子，它指使××汪精衞主唱反共和平運動雖已遭遇失敗，但是它扶助這些叛徒建立僞中央政府建立僞反共軍隊以圖加緊壓佔領區，加緊城亡中國的陰謀，却是變本加厲了！因此我們不僅要從行動上和一切封建殘餘民族叛徒親日漢奸，我們還要從理論上從一切方面，去和潛伏在抗日戰線內有意無意中替日×散放『反共和平』烟幕而阻礙抗戰建國的言論與行動。祇有在機警　頑强的鬭爭中，才能克服×奸陰謀爭取最後勝利。增强反對漢奸傀儡親日份子的力量，强增反對動搖妥協份子的力量，是當前最迫切的任務。</p>
<p>『前事不忘，後者之師』，我們謹以上述三點以期冀我政府與各黨派各團體的努力，以期冀我每一個不願做奴隸的中國同胞的努力。</p>

<p>事實是明顯的照示着、當蘆溝橋畔的烽火、燃燒起全國抗戰的烈燄時、由於我方軍器的過差、與大兵團指揮的缺乏經騐等客觀的原因、華北的戰局是處於極端劣勢的地位、向北與西一戰而失南口、繼棄大同、忻口、終于退出了太原與臨汾、南向失保定、正定、棄石家莊、娘子關、終亦　開了彰德與新鄉、……可是誰也想不到、就在這危急的情勢中、憑藉了我們堅强抗戰的意志、與破碎的山河、又重新建築起　固的鐵一般的長城、——不獨阻止了××的琅奔豕突、而且給予了××不可計數的嚴重打擊、一直　一年另八個月的今天、膠着了××整整的十個師團、與僞皇協軍共四十萬以上的大兵、使××視華北爲他　它的　、至於政治經濟的各個方面、也都那麼意外地迅速新生過來、當記者這一次從××爬上了大行山的脊背踏遍了一個個山城過來　、所看到的現象、眞令人有無限的欣悅、與無限的興奮、不過在這一個短短的通訊裏、是首先要介紹以嶄新的姿態演出、以最經　的力量、予××以最嚴重打擊的華北抗戰的新車鐵道破壞隊、</p>

<h3>全國實施精神動員　蔣委員長廣播演說</h3>
<p>（續昨）我特別希望住居在遠離後方，如天津上海漢口租界，以及海外與香港等地各位僑胞們，尤其是我們一般靑年子弟們，要切記你們國家的仇人和恥辱，在精神上，要自立自強，在生活上，要自愛自重，要負責，要知恥。這因爲是我聽見從上海天津漢口來的中外人士報吿，說我們在租界居住的靑年，還有眺舞遊盪不知自愛的，我聽了這話實在是非常的痛心。你們應該都要自己知道是在×人壓迫之下的一個憂患困苦的孤臣孽子，所以格外要克勤克儉耐苦耐勞，特別要以勞動爲本分，以服務爲目的，無論在何地何時，要自立自强，切勿被×人輕侮。更要爲友邦人士敬愛。如他們看了我們靑年國民，皆能明禮義，知廉恥，有志氣，有血心，能勤勞，能節儉，那麼，他們必對我們國家前途。就能發生無窮的希望，並且能够提高我們國家的人格。這就是先要我們全國男女同泡一致履行國民精神總動員的信條。力行國民公約的誓詞，就是要：（一）不違背三民主義；（二）不違背政府法令；（三）不違背國家民族的利益；（四）不做漢奸和不做×國的順民；（五）不參加漢奸組織；（六）不敬×軍和漢奸的官兵；（七）不替×人和漢奸做工；（八）不替×人和漢奸探聽消息；（九）不替×人和漢奸做工；（十）不用×人和漢奸僞銀行的鈔票；（十一）不買×人的貨物；（十二）不實糧食和一切物品給×人和漢奸，如此在精神上武裝起來，不受×人暴力威脅，不受×人利餌引誘，表現出我們的獨立自強，臨犯不懼，臨難不茍的氣節，使×人要格外的長攝恐懼，而不敢來輕侮壓迫。總之，臨到抗戰重要關頭的今天。我們不分前力與後方，乃至淪陷區域任何地點，都要實行國民精神總動員，厲行國民公約，就是澈底的來實行禮義廉恥的新生活。從今天爲始，大家都要立定這一個决心，不愧爲一個獨立自强的國民。同胞們，還要知道，精神總動員運動，不是祇憑五分鐘的熱血，可以收效的，我們必須要持之愈久而彌堅，所以要有恒，要不斷，精神動員的目的，不僅在今天　勵我們每一個人的精神，艱苦奮鬥，還要在持久鍛鍊之中，創造我們國民新的生命和新的精神。我們要不斷檢討自己，磨礪自己，鞭策自己，湯之盤銘曰：『苟日新，日日新，又日新』，我們必須有這種日新又新的覺悟和决心，不斷革新，不斷奮鬥，不斷加强我們人力物力，來打破×人殘暴狂妄的侵略，實現我們偉大的三民主義。各位同胞們，你們要知道，今日的精神總動員和國民公約，就是我們無形的搶炮，和無上的飛機炸彈，換言之，這精神動員和國民公約，亦就是抗戰的最大武器，而我們國民月會的組織，就是我們抗戰民衆的精神堡壘，所以我們必要澈底實行，而且始終無間，這樣力行下去的功效，一定是比任何鋼骨水泥的砲台要塞，還要有價値，還要有力量。所以國民月會，開始以後，我們切不可如同從前辦事一樣的奉行故事，必須剷除暫時敷衍塞責的惡習，而必要按照綱領規定辦法，切切實實的來身體力行。須知國民月會，就是我們精神革新的暮歧晨鐘。今日×人侵略我們中國，到處奸淫燒殺。猪狗都不如，這種恥辱，是比殺父之仇還要慘痛。我們每一個人，應該刻刻反問自己：「你豈忘記了×人侵犯你的國家，屠殺你同胞的大仇了麼？你豈忘記了×人搶你土地，炸你房子，殺你父子兄弟，汚你母女姊妹之恥辱了麼？」如果我們大天能這樣的警省惕勵，自反自勉，互相切磋，自然不會去做這樣醉生夢死苟且偷安的胡思妄行了。我們並且要進一步再想到我們五十年來的奇恥大辱，鉅創深痛，一定更能人人振作，個個奮發，達到復仇雪恥抗戰建國的目的。從今天起，開始國民月會以後，不僅希望大衆都能誠心誠意，率先　踐躬行，還要誠心誠意，互相勉勵督責，我們要造成一個新氣象，一面要社會中堅份子，樹立模範，負責倡導，一面還要大家彼此監察，規過勸善，互相勉勵。在今天，我們各人若是獨善其身，郎是救亡的，我們要認定，如果有一個同胞或有一個同事的人，不能實行精神動員，就是我們全國的恥辱，我們要抱定公忠熱誠的心腸，不但要自己負責任守紀律，而且要父子相勉，上下相勸共同督責來策進的。我們要厲行考核督察，互相砥礪觀摩，普遍發揚，我們中　民族固有的高尚偉大的精神，我希望從今天起，國家普遍發揚復興的一個新氣象。我們省　歷代艱雖締造開國之時，都有一種刻苦耐勞蓬勃奮發的朝氣，和憂勱惕厲的精神；如果這種精神不衰　下去。無論如何，就不會亡國。試看晉末五季宋明末葉朝野瀰漫在一種醉生夢死自私自利的風氣，和空虛散漫紛歧錯雜的情形，我們更要時時刻刻想到歷代興亡的教訓、追思祖宗締造的觀難，抱定决心奮鬥，努力來完成雪恥復仇的責任，我們必須痛切自覺，要知道這時胡的國難，全是我們這一代的沉迷　落不爭氣的結果，如果我們這一什不能復仇雪恥，眞是上無以對祖宗，下無以對子孫，今天竟有少數漢奸敗類和意志薄弱精神喪失之徒，來作無廉恥的賣國的勾當，這實在是我們國家的恥辱和不幸：但我們每一個有志氣有血氣的炎黃子孫，要决心對國家盡大忠，對民族盡大孝，就是要忠于責任，忠于職守，忠于法令，忠于　律，來完成我們責無旁貸的抗戰建國的使命。我們國家百世興亡，千秋榮辱，就要看我們在這千載難得的革命峙代，能不能澈底實行國民精神總動員的信條，能不能勵行國民公約的規條，能不能切實執行抗戰建國綱領。如果皆能實行，那我們必能在「國家至上、民族至上；軍事第一，獲利第一；意志集中，力量集中」三大目標之下，共同一致，團結精神，來粉碎×人的侵略政策，實現我們三民主義，完成我們革命建國的大業，各位同胞，再會　！（完）</p>

<h3>蔣委員長的「五一」訓詞</h3>
<p>五月一日，全國各地一律開始實施國民精神總動員，厲行國民公約，舉行國民月會。最高領袖蔣委員長並向全國廣播演講，語重心長，令人　憤興奮，平添一身爲國格人格而奮鬥的胆量。</p>
<p>我們苟免於×人的轟炸刦掠姦淫而寄身於外人勢力之下，三讀領袖訓詞，尤覺萬分感動，而願特別提出，以告我海外僑胞的，尙有如下三點：</p>
<p>第一，蔣委員長對於淪陷區內同胞，特表關懷之殷。而對於淪陷區內同胞之艱苦奮鬥，尤深致其崇敬愛護之意·他說：「你們在×人鐵蹄暴力之下，忍苦堅持，誓死掙扎，努力侏持着我們中華民族人格的種種努力，我和全體將士同胞，每聽　一次你們殺死一個×人。焚燒一囘×貨，就比接到前綫勝利的消息，還要感動，還要歡喜。因爲你們在×人後方×就是我們淪陷區內）殺害一個×人的效力，比在前方打死一百個×人的效果還要大！」最高領袖這幾句話，不僅使全國人民對于×人後方的戰鬥，要加注重與努力；不僅使全部淪陷區內的戰士能够益加奮勉冉接再厲了而且可以更嚴重地打擊汪精衛之流過去　　×後戰鬥游擊戰爭的毒計；而且可以更嚴正地指　一般記者和民眾輕視淪陷區內戰果的錯覺。我們今後不僅對於華北的八路軍和華中華南的新四軍的鬥爭，益加　敬×××，並且對子廣泛的×人後方，要以加倍的努力去組織，充實及擴大××××。</p>
<p>第二，蔣委員長對於居留上海天津漢口等地租界上的靑年之跳舞游蕩不知自愛，表示非常痛心，而且嚴正懇切地昭示全國說：『你們自己都應該知道，是在×人壓迫之下的一個憂患困苦的孤臣孽子，所以格外要克勤克儉，刻苦耐勞，特別要以勞動爲本分，以服務爲目的，無　在何地何時，要自立自强，切勿被×人輕侮，更要爲友邦人士敬愛』。我們認爲這　句話，正像慈父以血和淚的誡訓，也正像是對我們僑居洲外　尤其是香港同胞的誡訓，我們知道在上海天津漢口各地以至本港，依然有許多靑年在艱苦中爲祖國奮鬥，　情况有令人聞而感泣奮發老，但是多數『高等華人』，則仍度其荒淫靡爛的生活，而恬不知恥，此種行爲，其個人之墮落事小，國家民族之聲譽所受損害則大。因此我們三讀領袖訓詞，不僅希望大家「有則悔改應則加勉」，並且希望大家要以組織的力量，輿論的力量，隨地隨時，予以有效的嚴厲的制裁，我們要「不受×人輕侮，更要爲友邦人士敬愛。並且能够提高我們國家的人格』！</p>
<p>第三、蔣委員長對於×人漢奸之舉行、表示無限的創痛與憤怒，　痛述×人之「侵略我們中國、到處姦淫燒殺，當我們中國人比牛馬猪犬都不如，　種　辱比殺父之仇還要慘痛」，他更痛述漢奸親日派賣國　之『來作　廉恥的賣國的勾當』，「上無以對祖宗，下　以對子孫」。因此他要我們每一個人都應該刻刻反問自己，「你豈忘記了×人侵犯你的國家屠殺你的同胞的大仇了嗎，你豈忘記了搶爾土地，炸爾房子，殺爾父子兄弟，污戲母女姊妹之恥辱了嗎？」我們從×人轟炸搶劫××下逃亡出來的男女同胞，我們苟全生命於外人勢力之下的僑胞，我們更應該遵照領袖的指示、我們不僅應該刻刻反　自己，！</p>
<p>精神總動員不是唯心的空論，而是一種動員全民族力量以擁護抗戰建國的實際運動，我們要遵　領袖的五一訓詞，我們要用擁護國共合作抗戰建國的實際行動　實現全國精神　　員，每一個不願做奴隸的同胞、不僅要自己這樣做，而且要使你週圍的人羣這樣做！（朗）</p>

<h3>何香凝先生特為本刋賦詩…　全港戲劇界聯合公演‘黃花崗’特刋　教禮·黃花崗的演出</h3>
<p>— 蔡楚生</p>
<p>在香港各界賑聯會的主持之下，出動了三十多個團體，三百多個戲劇工作者，爲籌款撫恤前綫陣亡將士家屬，而公演偉大的革命歷史劇——「黃花崗」，這不僅在香港是空前的壯舉，卽在國內如過去的上海，廣州，和漢口等處，劇人們曾大批麕集過的地方，也是難得看見的盛會！</p>
<p>我們應該特別指出，這次的聯合大會公演，它的意義與作用，不但只祇是在籌得一筆欵子，去做我們後方民衆應應盡的一些責任就算完事，而在香港戲劇文化運動上，這是一個負有劃時代作用的工作。</p>
<p>我們知道，過去香港戲劇工作者在一個總的組織上是曾經發生過如何困難而始終不能健全地建立起來，這之間，是深刻地表現出我們的工作，還殘留着若十「宗派」「系別」「畛域」的種種應該說是不必要的觀念，而形成了分門別戶，各自爲戰的情態。這在整個戲劇運動上是將蒙受絕大的損失的。</p>
<p>也許有人說，我們要求得意志的統一，步調的一致，而有機地配合客觀環境所需要，以最敏感的動作，迅速的反映，迅速的收效，這以之責於剛在萌芽而尙未完全入於茁壯期的香港戲劇文化運動，似乎還覺得太早。這也許有它若干的理由在。然而，我們在接觸各個戲劇集團的一些機機中，除了很多値得我們致其崇敬而不必去說它以外，却也很容易發見各種錯誤的內容和形式，如「藝術至上」「戀愛至上」·「封建意識」等的作品還被搬演，「文明戲」（我看過幾個小劇團確有犯此等毛病之嫌）的技術還被運用，這種缺點的存在，不但是無從「茁壯」，而且將殺害「萌芽」；至於它的作用——效果，自然是和這正成一個正比例，這是如何値得注意的事情！</p>
<p>在「太平盛世」，也許可以「各行所見」，而讓他彼此散漫的發展下去，但在目前一切的情勢是這樣急激地無時不在變動中，無時不需要我們把一切的文化工具都變成有效的武器中，一個鄉愚受過幾天的壯丁訓練尙欲臨向前線，我們實在無時間可以再等待了！在神聖的民族自由解放鬥爭前，除了漢奸×人之外，仇×尙日可以在爲知己。何况是什麼「宗派」「系別」「畛域」的錯誤觀念，因此我除了以最大的敬意來歌頌這次的演出之外，還衷心地希望由於這次偉大的演出，而使各個戲劇的戰鬥單位，在彼此間多一種了解，對前路多一些認識，而破除一些不必要的成見，把這次偉大的集合底精神持續下去，迅速地建立起一個健全的總聯繫來！</p>
<p>我們知道，一切的文化部門，它的進步，卻是由於批判與督促，我們不能讓錯誤下去。我們不能讓已進步的因「滿足」而停留起來，我們不能讓散漫的現狀還是散漫下去，我們應該有嚴格的集體批判與督促，我們要在一個謹嚴的集體行動之下，使這曾是「荒島」的香港的戲劇之花，由「萌芽」而「茁壯」而「繁茂」！</p>
<p>除了對參加這次演出之工作者致其最大的崇敬外，還希望「黃花崗」的演出是香港戲劇文化運動時代的里程碑！　五·二夜匆促脫稿。</p>
<h3>從廣州的黃花崗首次公演說起</h3>
<p>— 司徒慧敏</p>
<p>一年來，·黃花第一次在廣州公演的時候，我正赶上那一次的熱間，時間過得很快，不是一年多了。那時候也是春天南國的溫暖味和前此沒有兩樣，黃花崗人士墓上靈監的雲天。現在也許還是一樣吧？可是那時候熱烈的情况，現在只能使我們深深地留在囘憶中了。一年之中。抗戰從第一個階段轉移到第二個階段，廣州淪陷了，黃花崗與黃花崗最初公演的地方已經所爲敵佔據，如果那劇場現在沒有給轟炸成殘墟，也許是給×人在那裏獰笑作樂了。一年，整整一年的歲月，這印像可還淸晰，當黃花崗第一次在廣州公演的當時，有至廣州的劇作家及由各地留粵工作的劇作家，共同參加那偉大的史劇寫作，在極迅速，極艮好的工作之下，產生了劇本並日還有全廣州的劇人參加演出，動員了大羣的市民來參加這一出演的集會，那天，民國二十七年三月二十九日，黃花崗七十二烈士殉國紀念日的晚上，城裏有火炬大遊行，西家園太平戲院裏公演這有意義的黃花崗，在×機轟炸威迫之下，警報尙未解除，我們的戲劇就在羣衆的熱烈掌聲中開始演出了，這一次大規模，大團結的演出，在以往中國戲劇運動史中能得幾囘？這戲劇，曾在廣州市民眼前，表演出二十餘年前，先烈犧牲熱血頭顱，締造民國之巨艱，激勵廣州市民，使保衛先烈精華危難造就的成果，保衛這提倡革命先聲的光榮土地。那一天，在黃花崗學聲的演出中，觀衆熱烈的高呼着「爲紀念七十二烈士的精神。我們要加緊保衛大廣東！」可是一年，一年以後的今日，我們在沉痛的感情中紀念那已失去光榮土地，在悲憤的囘憶中想起了黃花崗在廣州公演當特的熱烈情况，還使我們懷念着當時參加工作的人羣可敬的廣州劇人同志們，現在他們不是爲了保衛那光榮的土地而犧牲在×人的轟炸之下，也是疏散在各地去了，但願把毀滅不盡的戲劇種子遍播出去。使戲劇工作者之大同團結的精神在抗戰中生長起來。</p>
<p>黃花崗被帶到香港來，爲留港劇人接收公演了，這一次也是全港大規模。大團結的公演。這裏包括了全港的戲劇工作者，還有參加過廣州首次公演的同志們，其意義當不減於去年，×人的進攻越厲害，我們對戲劇的意義也只有加强，當最初在廣州公演的時候，我們曾高呼「爲紀念七十二烈士的精神，我把要加緊保衛大廣，，」可是在目前，其最初公演一年後之今日，我們的戲劇義義應該是「為紀念七十二烈士的精神，我們要加緊反攻敵人，爭囘那已失的光榮土地，加緊反攻×人，爭囘我們黃花岡最初公演的劇場，洗雪×人污辱先烈墳地的恥辱，願戲劇工作同志與留港僑胞們，以此大團結的公演作爲自勉。</p>
<p>今年黃花崗的公演，還有點應該特別闡明的意義是，當去年黃花岡公演的時候，我們的抗×陣營還潛行着化裝家國志士的漢奸×××××××××××，他們掛着老革命黨的招牌到處行騙，爲敵人作說客。可是目前這陰謀已被破了，汪×與黃花岡烈士同年代踏上中國民族革命鬥爭的道路，但是烈士們犧牲了，××××××××××××××××光榮的犧牲者，要使中國人民陷於比滿淸專制時代過着更悽憾的奴役生活，現在一切都揭穿了。當我們在香港公演這黃花崗壯烈史詩的時候，這些民族革命叛徒們，陰謀出賣黨國者，正逃出了抗戰的國境。現在正各處大肆活動，公關成半公開的與×人互通聲氣，我們為加强黃花崗的出演意義應該特提出闡明這意義於僑胞之前，是：爲紀念七·二烈士的精神，我們要加緊鏟除背叛先烈，出賣黨國的奴才，化裝的漢奸。×××××××。</p>
<p>此次香港的大規換，大團結的黃花崗公演。在劇運的意義上固不待言，這一次創下了中國海外演劇史上的歷史紀錄，只有抗戰的現階段現年代才能實現，在以前，劇人的聯絡缺乏，國人與個人，團體與集體之間保持了種種的私見然而這些缺點，在長期抗戰的進程中已經改進了，這一次的公演，與廣州最初黃花二公演史加團結，使不能團結的捐棄了前緣、這寶貴的事實，願戲劇工作諸同志們發揚血鞏固之。　五·一，深夜。</p>
<h3>也是一例</h3>
<p>— 夏衍</p>
<p>知道留港戲劇界朋友打算上演「黃花崗」的那一瞬間，我不想矯飾，我排解不了一脈黯然不堪回首的心路。去年那時候的景况，不遼像昨大一樣的明晰嗎？而今年幾十個人聚在一起創作「黃花崗」劇本的永漢路國華銀行三樓，百十個人忙着排戲的教育會體堂，那些一冥曾就會浮映出面影來的忙着釘布景的小朋友，那一場場招致了萬上個觀衆的太平院，甚至這劇本的主人——簽徵着廣東革命精神的七十二烈士墓，不都已經淪陷，分散，和被×蹄蹂躪了嗎？</p>
<p>可是，廣東的革命精神，是不會因爲暫時的失敗挫折和淪陷而消失的。創作和演出「黃花崗」的同志們，在廣東前線的可不必說，暫時退幼到香港的不也還再接再厲，拿戲劇這武器來和×××××？第二期作戰的主要戰術是一攻心」，「黃花崗」雖則不是一個完整的藝術品，但是在××××「巨心」戰術之點，是有他犀利的利用的。</p>
<p>在勝利將要到來之前的一瞬間，往往會遭遇到最艱難困苦，最難于忍耐的環境的，黃花崗的烈士們，就是用自己的血肉，突破了一時間困難，而對全國大衆表示了革命必成之信心的一個例子，就用這一個例，來打擊一切在困難的時候企圖投降變節的人們吧。</p>
<h3>「中國人的確是天才」</h3>
<p>— 高長生</p>
<p>爲着「黃花崗」的上演，陸浮先生囑我轉請郭沬若先生寫文章，但是算時間，已經來不及了。一篇「中國人的確是天才」，是郭先生爲着重慶上演拙作「一年背」而寫的，但是內容却泛論着中國的戲劇和文化，那麼就將這篇文章在香港發表一次吧。　夏衍。五，一</p>
<p>「中國人的確是天才」，這是日本的一位老作家秋田雨雀對我說的話。</p>
<p>是前年春天了，那時候我還住在日本·東京的一部分留學生要公演曲禺的「日出」，扮演女主角的是封禾子小姐，她是才從復且大學畢業，往日本去留學的。</p>
<p>「日出」一共演了三天、大大地受了日本人的歡迎、封小姐的照片幾乎每一家報紙上都印出來了。</p>
<p>我是第二天晚上去看的，偶然遇着秋田雨雀也在，也是看第二次的了。他很誠懇地對我說：</p>
<p>「中國人的確是天才，像「日出」這樣規模宏大的劇本，日本很少見，尤其是像封小姐這樣的演員，日本從不曾演出過的。」</p>
<p>我對他說：「封小姐還是一位學生呢。」</p>
<p>「是啦」，他立卽囘答着，「我昨晚同她談了好一會，所以中國人的確是天才。」</p>
<p>他那一頭的銀髮都蕩漾着他的誠意。</p>
<p>不久蘆溝橋事變發生了，我在七月尾上，囘到上海以來，將近兩年了，我在上海見過「武則天」，在漢口有見過「李秀成之死」，在重慶，見過「中國萬歲」］「鳳凰城」，「民埃光榮」，「戰鬥」。這些劇本，我覺得都比「日出」還要進步，而演員的技藝裏是有一日千里之慨。</p>
<p>當我每看一次話劇，我總要回憶起日本的那位有良心的老作家，同時更要回想起他對我所說的那番誠懇的話。</p>
<p>昨天我過江去，在中央攝影場的宿合裏，看見了朋友們的「一年間」的排演。我看見朋友們的廢寢忘餐的努力，那行動音容的那樣動人，我不免又把秋田雨雀和他的話想起了：「中國人的確是天才。」</p>
<p>像秋田雨雀那樣的人，能把中國人的好處看成自己人一樣的好處，在日本人中是絕無僅有的，就讓我再把封禾于小姐為例吧。</p>
<p>封小姐本打算在日本留學，再求深造，但她受不過日本人的迫害，終于在蘆溝橋事變未發生之前便跑囘來了，她自己也曾對我設過好風次，說她那兒總常有兵士和憲兵去厭煩，總不相信她是學生，總說她是專門的演員，而且還懷疑她是借演劇爲烟幕的女間諜。她在熱海去溫泉的時候，連赴廁所，進浴池，都有人尾隨。因此，她實在吃不消。便打斷了留學的念頭。</p>
<p>我這也算是——算是「舉一個例」，可以證明我們中國人的確是天才，而一般對中國不懷好意的日本人，是嫉姤我們，盡力阻礙我們的發展的。</p>
<p>但我們絲毫也不要氣餒，同時也不要自滿。我們中國人不僅在演劇方面是天才，便在任何方面都富有天才。有天才須得努力發展。有天才而不肯努力，那正是有惡意的日本人所馨查禱祝的。</p>
<p>朋友們，我們大家下一個决心，刻苦地奮動吧。我們要把各種成績提供出來實獻於人類文化，要使全世界的人都心悅誠服地這樣說：</p>
<p>「中國人的確是天才！」</p>
<h3>鬥爭的開塌劇</h3>
<p>— 費穆</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭爲法國大革命寫了一部「七月十四號」；我們中國有一部「黃花崗」。</p>
<p>沒有一個國家的革命，像中國一樣，在准翻專制的朝廷之後，建立了共和政體，將中國從少數民族間最少數的貴族統治之下解放出來：同時，再在社會和文化各方面做着澈底的改造工作。把中國引到建設現代國家的道路上，而演進於今日達蓬勃勃全國一致爲獨立自由平等而抗戰建國的階段，這二十年來一貫的革命火焰。</p>
<p>戰鬥精神和熊熊不熄的革命火焰，是遠從辛亥時代七十二烈士的碧血中迸發出來的。</p>
<p>宣統二年三月二十九日，最初的燃起了革命的火把，這個火把至今還照耀着全中國，照耀着全世界。</p>
<p>這個說明了中國民族的戰鬥性和不可扯服性。</p>
<p>黃花崗先烈，不過七十二人，而在此七十二先烈之後，爲國家民族的革命戰鬥而犧牲的無名英雄，又不知其有多少萬人。在今日抗戰階段中，這種犧牲精神更發揚到了極致，</p>
<p>在悠長的二十八年之間，無論是如何地滄桑變幻；中國始終朝着光明大道躍進，沒有一種勞力可以阻止它。</p>
<p>「黃花崗」公演是多少含着表達先烈和紀念民革命的意義的；但不能僅僅作爲歷史劇看，因爲它還是我們這一時代的史實，是一個民族解放鬥爭的開塲劇：（參加三二九之役的革命前輩們，多數至今還健在。）在心理的時間上亦即是歷史的起點上，是與「台兒莊」「五百壯士」之類的國防劇同樣新鮮而且同樣切合現實的。</p>
<p>感謝着在這時候能看見「黃黃岡」的上演，幷敬祝其成功。　五、一，匆促中</p>
<h3>編後感</h3>
<p>— 陸浮</p>
<p>在極匆促的幾天中，總算把十四個「黃花崗」特刊編完了。雖然每大得不到二三小時的睡眠，雖然每天都在極度忙迫和疲乏中，但是，面對着這七十萬字以上的作品，聯想到這空前的陣容，空前的團結，空前的服務，是使我受着深深的感動而不知到疲乏的。</p>
<h3>繼續下去</h3>
<p>— 盧教</p>
<p>全港話劇工作者統一陣綫的組織，曾經過了好幾次的集會商討。但可惜的是每一次的集會都成了浪費，結果總是無下文而散！</p>
<p>這次，由於一個具有偉大底歷史意義的日子的號召、以及同志們的精誠合作，果然完成了這一空前的壯舉，這是値得歡欣，也値得慶祝的！</p>
<p>這一次的創舉誠屬空前也自有其重大的意義，但也只不過是一次大規模的聯合公演而已，整个個兒的統一團結的組織還沒有成立，這不但是美中不足，還是一个最大的缺憾！</p>
<p>如果我們坦白地，毫不掩飾地，對於這聯演的工作過程加以檢討，就不免會感覺到組織的散漫，各部門缺少密切的聯繫，因之，就影響到工作開展的遲緩，這就是因爲沒有一个健全的統一組織的原故。</p>
<p>尤其是在目前，香港的劇運正在蓬勃然烈地開展，劇團的組織又在不斷地增加着，這當然是一種可喜的現象，不過，在叧一方面。那幾個規模較大的職業劇團，由於劇場以及其他種種客觀條件的限制，在非常艱苦中爭扎着，從這種情形看來，就可以看出來，話劇在香港還沒有取得穩定的社會地位，沒有取得廣大的觀衆，這總是劇連前途的嚴重的問題，而這些問題，却又不是一兩個團體孤軍奮鬥所能解决的，因爲這是整個劇連的問題，是必須全體工作者共同努力去解决。那末，爲了正在抬頭開展中的劇運前途，爲了確立話劇在社會上的地位，尤其爲了今後，作路向的决定……統一的組織實在是必需同時以是急需的的了！</p>
<p>這一次的聯演，雖然在組織上不無缺點，但由於全體工作者對於這一工作的意義具有認識，又抱着同一的目的，所以在工作的過程中，還是非常地親熱，密切，和樂融融，這是最叫人感到愉快的。</p>
<p>然而，令天是公演了，再過兩天，工作就完了。於是這一次臨時的組織也就結束解體了，從此這十幾天以來那種和樂融融的親熱的情緒也跟着散失而不可再得了，這是多未可惜的事！</p>
<p>所以我希望這一次的聯演不要止於首次的聯演，而希望把這次團結的精神繼續保持下去，馬上來一个健全永久的統一的組織，我深信凡是參加這次聯演的工作者都會有這一要求的吧！</p>
<p>抗戰的最后勝利是必屬於我的，同樣地，話劇的前途也一樣是光明的！</p>
<h3>民族革命史劇「黃花崗」的故事</h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>黃花崗這偉大的革命的史實，已經彪炳千古，劇本中所寫的不過「戲劇的」一部份，是詩的眞實而已。</p>
<p>孫總理自乙酉中法戰敗之年，决志傾覆淸廷，創造民國！甲午中日戰爭之後，因而有丁未廣州之役，庚十八國聯軍入京之後，因而有同年惠州之役；背景所在，因昭然矣。此後萍醴之役，黃花崗之役，乙未惠州之役，欽廉之役，鎮南關之役，河口之役虜酋戰恬母子死時，安慶之役，廣州之役，庚戍廣州新軍之役，莫不有反三民主義之背景，卽激動三民主義之猛進·凡屬黨員，莫不本此主義，前卜後繼，無少餒却，日俄協約成，因而有三月二十九日廣州舉義，黃花崗烈士之視死如歸，同在此主義鼓蕩之中，而無或稍異。不過以省或一省一部之黨員爲之，此後則集海內外之黨員爲之。且以黨中之精英，純粹為主義而犧牲，尤足震動全國，使國民一致贊助革命，不易年而民國吿成，故此役可謂黃花崗烈士爲三民主義而犧牲，卽以黃花崗烈士犧牲之精神。傳播三民卅義於民衆，而民國得以創造·辛亥年三月十日·在武漢演飛艇的那一天，從南洋囘來的溫生才，預備行總李準。</p>
<p>溫生才：老黃，事情究竟怎麼樣了？</p>
<p>黃俠毅：昨晚總部緊急會議，决定改期發動。</p>
<p>溫生才：改期？今天已經三月初十了，又改在什麼時候？</p>
<p>黃俠：三月廿八。</p>
<p>溫生才：這樣遲。</p>
<p>義憤塡胸而訓練不够的溫生才，實在等不得了。在飛艇演習完畢之後，他看見一頂大員的轎子來了，以爲是李準便衝上去連發幾槍。轎子裏的人是死了，他也彈盡被擒。</p>
<p>轎夫乙：（對統帶）禀吿大爺，孚老爺已經歸天了。</p>
<p>溫生才：什麼，孚老爺？</p>
<p>防衛軍：孚琦將軍你沒有聽見過嗎？</p>
<p>溫生才：什麼？坐在轎裏的不是李準嗎？……哈哈，李準，李準，算你運氣好，可憐的孚琦，你却做了李準的替死鬼；哈哈……也好，雖然是殺錯了。但是多殺一個漢奸，一個漢奴，中國就可以少一條害虫　（序幕）</p>
<p>溫生才犧牲了。三月廿五日上午八時，在甘家巷八號的秘密機關裏，喩培倫製做着炸彈，女同志們一齊熱烈地工作着。一些革命同志，等待着黃克強的到來。機關是西關有八個—東區有十二個。河南有八個。論已經有七十餘枝，但是先鋒有八百人，從日本安南運的大幫軍械，要廿七號才能到，他們在着順着—同時尹同志徐宗漢又來報吿總督府下命令，在五天以內挨戶搜索全城，而且新軍下月初要調走。</p>
<p>在滿州巡捕來搜查的時候，女同志都扮做尹同志的家眷。敷衍過去了！只是因爲一個名單在陳鏡波手裏機乎使全體覆沒。</p>
<p>危機剛剛過，又有人敲門，原來是林覺民的太太，遠地來找他，爲了革命，爲了工作，他不能見他那熱情而恩情極重的太太。他只有避開，讓培倫和卓嚴興把他敷衍走了。</p>
<p>黃克强來，給了大家希望與勇氣。在起事遲早的爭論中，他說，「凡百事情，要幹的時候。必要有一個大决心，就是不成功卽成仁」才有收穫。事到今日，如果我們再改期，那就等于把我們自已來解個。將來如事不成，何以對得起總理，何以對得起海外的同胞？如果大家沒有决心，我願一人獨拼李準。以謝同志。」於是大家决定了廿八日起事。　（第一幕）</p>
<p>另一個陣營，三月廿七日的深夜，在張鳴岐的洋花廳裏，婢女和男役調着情，張鳴岐帶着幕友黃國才回來了。另一幕反報吿抓到私運軍火的革命黨人，正在奇怪着革命黨人爲什麼捉不盡殺不淸的時候，二太太却出來不答應了，爲的是要大人保重身體。正在這時候李提督來見，說明了嚴重的情勢，會商了應付的策略，「趁新軍確探的時候，派人借名去檢閱兵舍，去的時候，可以一個個把他留在營裏的槍枝做柄取下來，還有便是下令全城，挨戶搜查，嚴韋亂黨。」</p>
<p>有奸細來吿密，他們知道了二十八號起事的消息，張鳴岐嚇得脚都軟了，李準决把吳宗禹的巡防營調囘鞏固省城，用兩營駐守龍王廟高地，其餘的守在靖海門沿河一帶船上。　（第二幕）</p>
<p>騷亂和緊張。</p>
<p>廿八日晚七時許，在另一革命機關，許多男女同志，搬運着軍火，林文，林尹明，林覺民，喩增倫，鄭坤，宋玉琳，提起新軍廿九晚被繳械的事。</p>
<p>林覺民，不錯，勝利一定在我們的縱然我們自己被犧牲。——爲了獲取勝利，我們的犧牲是必要的，祗要我們有犧牲的決心，縱然這一次失敗了，對於一般民衆的影響。是不可磨滅的！！</p>
<p>鄭坤；誰怕犧牲，誰就不配做一個革命者。</p>
<p>黃克强到了，說接到香港的電報改三十起事，已經回電說是來不及改，仍定廿九日起事。可是，胡毅生報吿一路女同志運的軍火被破獲了，陳炯明又來報吿調來了兩營巡防軍派三哨助守龍王廟高地的消息。大家要求改期，黃克强也氣憤而慘痛的同意了。</p>
<p>徐宗漢喻培倫趕到，李文甫，林覺民都是贊成依期起事的。</p>
<p>黃克强：好，那麼我們就這樣地决定。集中我們的力量，明天進擊督署，我們要完成這一頁光榮的歷史。</p>
<p>喩培倫：時機已經到了最後關頭，不成功，當成仁，我們大家抱着决死之心，現在已經沒有考慮的餘地了。</p>
<p>黃克强：對了，不成功，當成仁，爲了獲得民族的解放，爲了爭取三民主義實現，不容我們有絲毫猶豫。一切犧牲在所不惜，我們要用我們的血，用我們的肉，用我們的頭顱，來築起一座光榮的紀念碑。</p>
<p>三月廿九日下午五時半，張鳴岐李準正在總督署審訊革命黨陳美新饒國英的時俟，革命黨攻進來了。張鳴歧李準倉皇地逃了。</p>
<p>因爲實力的不够，革命黨傷亡了很多，黃克强，朱執信等被同志催促着走了。李文甫等彈盡被捕七十二烈士壯烈的犧牲。</p>
<p>同年十月十日武昌起義成功，建立中華民國。（第四幕）</p>
<p>二十八年的三月二十九日，我們僑胞開着黃花崗紀念大會。「親愛的同胞們，同志們，過經了二十二個月的民族自衛抗戰，已經進展到更嚴重的新階段了！要加速的爭取抗戰最後勝利，只有竭盡自己的能力，澈底的完成黃花崗七十二烈士和總理交付給我們的使命！新的中國就要新生了。黃花崗烈士的精神不死！中華民族萬歲！中華民族萬歲！」（尾聲）</p>

<h3>不違背</h3>
<p>— 亞路</p>
<p>不達背三民主義，不遠背政府法令，不遠背國家民族的利益。這是國民精神總動員綱領上的國民公約十二條中的開頭三條。凡是懷得國民精神總動員意義的人，對這三個問題一定不會忽略過去。</p>
<p>對于有利於國家民挨的條件，沒有違背的舉動，固然可算一個良好國民，但是威格說起來，僅僅做到不違背的程度，在這抗戰時期，似乎還不够，我們必須更進一步去切實地實行三民主義，政府法令和爲國家民族增進利益的事情。</p>
<p>不過我們要實行這三件工作，必須對它有深切的認識。第一，我們要知道三民主義就是救國主義，因爲它的目標一是求得民族的解放，二是求得民權的自由，三是求得民生的平等。目前中國最重要的工作就是正爲民族求解放的抗戰，民族旣得解放，以權的自由，民生的平等，就可迎刃而解了。但是我們要實行三民主義，必須要認識我們國家的地位，增强我們民族的意識，而且更娑有忠於國忠于事忠于民的精神，把各人的才力錢力儘量貢獻於民族解放的鬥爭上。</p>
<p>第二點關於政府的法令，不但不能違背而且要各盡能力去實行。國民精神總動員法令，是現階段最迫切需要實行的。委員長早已說過：「抗動轉入第二期後，敵人在軍事上已經是進退維谷，一天一天的窘迫，一天一天的徬徨了；最近敵人側重政治舞弄，揑造事實，離間國人，無非先要制服我們的精神，分解我們的精神，然後來征服我們整個民族……。」所以有了這次國民精神總動員的法令，當足以激勵人民的志氣，增進人民對於國家的認識，堅强人民對於勝利的信念，振作人民抗戰的精神，使敵人政治的陰謀，動搖和麻醉的手段無所施其伎。</p>
<p>第三點是實行爲和國家民族增强利益的問題，親個人的利益高於國家民埃的利益，這實在是一種自私自利的觀念。古人說：「皮之不存，毛將焉附。」這就是說人民與國家有脣齒相依的關係，如其國家釗了不能生存的時候，人民就根本享受不釗安居樂業的利益，而被人家當作奴隸對待了。所以國家的利益應該視爲高於一切。中國現在抗戰求生，凡是有利於國家的工作，我應應得集中力量去做。因爲國家得到復興後，人民綫得亨受無窮盡的利益。</p>
<p>抗戰必勝，建國必成，我們必須把國民精神總動負切切實實地實行，不僅不達背而已。</p>
<h3>多岐之路</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>放舟曲江中，島嶼多縈迴，抑或無車古道上，車轍多縱橫時，一個旅人常因不辨東西，愴然於多歧之路。</p>
<p>不是平直如矢的大道，沒有路標，沒有地圖沒有人指引，而况天色又十分灰暗，山雨欲來，黑雲滿天，旣不能登高望遠，又不能察目辨微，你將無心雍容鎭靜，若無其事的獨立於岐途，牲口已疲，人也飢渴，別遭刦於强梁，別委身於狼虎，該打個尖，找尋你今晚的歇宿地了，於是你得從若干條歧途中，選擇你應走的路。</p>
<p>每人有他的前程，每人有一個「打尖」處。牲口已疲，人也飢渴，暮色亦已四垂，不能木立於歧途，露宿於荒野，於是旅人乃各各撑篙搖漿，秣馬膏車，各自登上山坡，度越平隰，奔溜灘頭，週環港灣，亦各各遭着逆流順風，艱難平坦，烏道羊腸、死生禍福。</p>
<p>路是不測的。眼前的平坦與險惡，很難推測你的安樂與艱苦，一個聰明正直的旅人，决不能因苟安旦夕而忘記了他的前程。</p>
<p>多歧的路亦復决定多塗的命運。往往一條幸福的路埋藏於荊棘，邪惡的路，反亦滿果漿，朋友，你將怎樣抉據你的路途呢？</p>
<p>欽食那果槳嗎？還是讓荊棘刺破你的兩足呢？沒有自始幸福的路，沒有不酸澀的橄欖，沒有永遠平靜的人生。人生，天地之逆旅，不也是一段多變的歧途嗎？貧困的折磨，强權的鞭笞，甘甜的利誘，往往使你失去了主見，你不能靜下心來，顧全你的榮辱，生前與身後，祖宗與子孫。於是你享受甜美的果槳，而屛棄荊棘。</p>
<p>眼前的悲傷與快樂，算來都是浮幻，短視的人眼睛不能透過浮幻，乃各各體會目前的哀樂。</p>
<p>哀樂往往無常，眼前的得意，不免是將來的沮喪，得意坦途，乃陷身於泥淖；貪飲果漿，乃自斃於毒汁；滿心夜宿無虞的人，乃亦葬身於狼虎，憑蠢的笑痕還遺留在脣邊，貪得與苟安，却已換來了殘酷與悲慘。</p>
<p>瞬息萬變，曾有遜於多岐之路的變幻嗎？幸福的，悲慘的，黑暗的，光明的，正直的，邪惡的，縱橫交錯，一一擺在你的眼前，任你選擇，每一條路有每一條路的命運，路是多岐的，命運亦復多歧，聽憑你選擇吧。你可因此取禍，亦可因此得福，亦可遺奥萬年，亦可流芳百世。</p>
<p>也許你明明知道投奔你的前程，但你怕走一望荊棘的路，人也疲，肚也餓，路也長，身體亦塞冷，沒有穿吃，沒有玩兒，你不免無力，也不免厭倦。自然你不免橫一橫心，狠狠地說，蠻幹一下吧，於是你走上邪惡的路，你說是爲了生活。</p>
<p>不錯，誰都要生活。走上邪惡的路，你眼前是生活了。不但生活，而且你能够放僻邪侈，你得意眼前，但你也曾縱目那遙遠，速山與彼岸嗎？那數箭以外的歡愉，最後的終局，你能指點給我看嗎？</p>
<p>你色然以喜，我能不戚然以悲？</p>
<p>於是我悚然，放開眼，矚目高處與遠力：我辨識紛紜的道路。終於我發兒只有兩條：眼前的苦與眼前的樂</p>
<p>我再覓取一個山峯，望見更高與更遠，我看見的仍是爾條：永久的苦與永久的樂。目前的苦樂與永久並不相同，而却相反。</p>
<p>多岐的路，亦復决定多歧的命運。抉擇一下吧，你我該上路了。</p>
<p>山雨欲來，黑雲滿天。暮色又復四垂。不也是你飢渴時，疲倦時，搖動時嗎？</p>
<p>多岐之路，蒼茫中殊難辨識，出處你不可不愼。</p>
<h3>包</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>周知事正月宣傳班長要請他到城外去出巡，心上老大不願意，接着一碗白本耳，用木銀匙不停的攪，呆視着白糊糊的熱氣出神。王姨太斜靠在門邊，看得有趣，順手拍的的一聲，把電鈕關了，立時房間真黑了下來。周知事猛地一驚，把碗往桌上一推，站起來就想躱，忽聽得一串嬌蕩的笑聲，才曉得是王姨太，接着電燈也亮了，這才重新坐下。王姨太花技招展的撲過來，周知事重新端起碗來，又像怒又像愛的說：</p>
<p>「這類玩笑，開不得呢，警察局長剛被刺，我的性命也掛在半空裏，你們不要只懂胡鬧……」</p>
<p>「別說罷，誰叫你當這臭差使！」王姨太湊過來，張開嘴，粉臉又白又紅，接着問：「够甜不够甜？」</p>
<p>周知事顫巍巍遞過一匙，送到王姨太嘴裏，門外張媽輕輕的叫：「老爺」。</p>
<p>周知事忙推去王姨太，放下碗，莊嚴地問：</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>張媽鄭重地捧着一個紙包，走近桌子邊，雙手捧給周知事。王姨太接過來，但立刻放到桌子上，嘴一尖：</p>
<p>「呀，好重！」</p>
<p>周知事一面檢視那個包，一面聽張媽說。</p>
<p>「門房送進來，說是一個小伙子送來的，問他要囘片不要，他說不必不必，扭身走了。」</p>
<p>一個小伙子，不要回片，包上沒有字，這樣重，他抖抖地仔細米解那繩，那繩結得緊，好一會解不開，王姨太不耐類，搶過去就愛撕，重手重脚的。周知事發起急來，忙按住了王姨太的手：</p>
<p>「輕點輕點，當心別是炸彈」，</p>
<p>王姨太一聽，嚇得縮回手，撲過來抱住了周知事，粉臉變了色，寫張媽：</p>
<p>「怎麽不問問淸楚，那裏送來？裏面是什麽東西？就這麽糊裏糊塗的捧了進來……」</p>
<p>周知事皺眉，伸出手指想解那結，不住的說：</p>
<p>「別閙別閙，那還成呻麽話！裏面不是炸彈，怎不敎人笑死！傳到班裏去，更有得他們奚落了。鬥房也算荒唐，怎麽不問問淸楚呢？」</p>
<p>王姨太雙手攔住，不許他動，兩個撓做一團。</p>
<p>忽然壁上的電話響了，張媽上去接了，一手高舉聽筒叫：</p>
<p>「老爺，趙公館趙參事來的電話。」</p>
<p>王姨太跳起來，放下周知事，搶上去，接過聽筒，按在耳上，喘着說：</p>
<p>「哦，是你，曖，我是我……叫誰送來？什麽？……大聽的紅燒牛肉？……好，好，收到了，可是還沒有開，爲什麽不自已帶來？……哦！好，老爺嗎？睡了……」</p>
<p>周知事搶進來，她已把聽筒掛了，打着哈哈，拍拍周事知的肩，設：</p>
<p>「小趙從京裏來，帶來了大聽的紅燒半肉，叫他家奶媽去兒子送了來，那孩子不經世面，放下就走了，沒有要回片，他不放心，打電話問問。」</p>
<p>周知事吐了一口氣，張媽聽明白了。收下白木耳碗，靜靜的退出去了。</p>
<h3>葬</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>從天邊扯起了廣大的夜幔，遮掩件整個的莽原，穹蒼像片黑茫茫的海，不見一顆星，沒有半牙月，都沉沒於海底了，冷淸，空闊，幽謐，只有夜寒在溜動。</p>
<p>這兒曾是散放着芬芳的豐饒的原野，金黃的稻穗抖動着豐實的波浪，淸晨和傍晚，茅舍的頂上冒起縷縷靑色的炊烟，慢慢混進乳白的朝霧裏，絳紅的暮靄中，潺潺的流水繞着人家，是寗靜的，和平的鄉村。</p>
<p>如今，靜悄悄躺着的是頹垣，是碎瓦，坎坷的土地噴發着霉爛味，血腥氣，風聲也似嗚嗚，世界埋在死亡的重壓裏。</p>
<p>一羣黑影蠕蠕地朝這兒移動，像條小蛇，固執地爬着，終於停留下來。憩息在小溪傍，約莫有三十多個漢子。背着雜色的槍枝，三八，盒千砲，穿着各樣的服裝，軍服，短褂，有着不同的臉膛，方的，圓的，但，人心却不是「各如其面」，信念，意志，把弟兄們鎔成一塊鋼，鬥爭是鉄砧，錘鍊得更純，更堅了。</p>
<p>「死了，」隊尾的兩位弟兄放下拙陋的祖架床，摸摸傷者，吐出這兩個簡捷的字，語調悒鬱而低沉，流過夜空，這消息扭扯着每個人的臉，起着悲哀的痙攣。愴痛駐在全隊人的心頭，如夕陽中烏鴉棲於塔頂，但非絢爛的黃昏，而是蒼茫的深夜。豁然一聲黑色的扉門聞了，一擒古，喬下一個頑强的靈魂，整日與死亡戲嬉者。</p>
<p>隊伍籠罩着在靜寂裏，人們都不言語。三個同志默默地掘着坑，一剷一剷的挖下去，像是削着人們自已的心。</p>
<p>料峭的夜風，吹拂着面頰，如調皮的不知名的小蟲似的是使人沉沉欲醉的季節。這夥漢子却依然像怪石般的獃着。過度的悲痛麻痺了人的感覺。</p>
<p>殉難的戰上在十多隻眼睛肅然的注視下，囘到土地中去。埋葬了。憤恨在活着的人的的中燃燒，復仇的火花迸裂在心頭。</p>
<p>「今天的一場戰鬥犧牲了一位同志，夥伴的陣亡，固然要使我們難過，但犧牲却是不可避免的，我們要有勇氣面對死人、自由和解放是要出血去換的，爲了民族的永存，我們就不多吝惜個人的生命，×同志的死是光榮的，偉大的。」隊長壓抑着自已的情感，一字一句的說，有力地，堅定地。「我們應該用更頑强，更持久的抗爭來紀念死難的同志！」</p>
<p>心上的白鴿在鼓翼，要從腔子裏飛出來。結尾的一句話挑撥了白鴿的翅膀，逗起飛意。</p>
<p>深沉的夜景中，人影又向前蠕動，終於消在無盡的夜夜裏。</p>
<p>遠天有尖銳的槍聲劃破長夜的寂寥。</p>

<p>「你跟誰開玩笑，誰是「小姐」？你今天不說就不行！」</p>
<p>她暴發着稚氣；這稚氣是故意討人憐愛的一種。他在她的面前，也故意裝做一個孩，他說：</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Public Opinion of the Philippine People: Independence, Democracy, and a New Policy of Peace</h3>
<p>— By G. Capadocia of Cabaduc, Philippines</p>
<p>The issue of Philippine independence is currently under debate in various circles. The general public holds diverse views on this matter. Some advocate for immediate and complete independence, while others favor a self-governing protectorate or an expanded autonomous republic. The happiness and prosperity of the Philippine people, as well as the nation's security, hinge on this issue. The Communist Party of the Philippines, in order to fully express its stance on this issue, hopes that every Filipino can understand and adopt it as their own opinion.</p>
<p>1.  Democracy and Fascism</p>
<p>We cannot separate the destiny of our nation from the destiny of all mankind, because the world today is divided into two main fronts engaged in struggle. Mad, fascist warlord aggressors are launching attacks on people who love democracy and peace. Italy has already occupied Abyssinia and is waging a war of aggression against the Spanish Republic. After seizing Manchuria, Japan is waging a war to conquer all of China, threatening the autonomy and peace of all Asian and Malay peoples. Japan, Germany, and Italy are the manufacturers of war, attempting to destroy all the progress of mankind over the centuries.</p>
<p>Opposing fascism are the forces of democracy and peace. Peace-loving people around the world have the glorious historical mission of stopping aggression, safeguarding peace, and paving the way for democracy. The people of the venerable Spanish Republic are resolutely waging a heroic war against those traitors in their country who have betrayed the nation and accepted the help of German and Italian fascist aggressors. At the same time, the Chinese people are also waging a similarly heroic war of resistance for their national survival, for our democracy and independence. Currently facing all mankind is the opposition of democracy and fascism, the opposition of peace and war, the opposition of progress and reaction. To develop our democracy, ensure our national security and the welfare of our people, and achieve complete national independence is inseparable from the global struggle of democracy against fascism.</p>
<p>Our country is also inevitably threatened by the conspiracies and aggression of fascist countries. Franco's henchmen, who are also the largest monopolists in the Philippines, are freely organizing to aid the rebels in Spain, while simultaneously establishing fascist organizations in the Philippines. Since the establishment of the alliance between Tokyo, Rome, and Berlin, Franco's henchmen have undoubtedly colluded with the lackeys of these three fascist countries in an attempt to destroy our autonomous republic.</p>
<p>If we do not recognize that we are under the threat of Japanese fascist aggression, then we will first fall into the danger of national suicide, because after Japan's fascism colludes with Germany and Italy, it is preparing for a new world war to destroy world democracy, and as a result, it will easily make the Philippines its military base to invade other nations in the Far East. Japanese warships and spies are active along the Pacific coast and in various straits. Japan has stationed heavy troops in Taiwan, close to the northern part of the Philippines. Its navy and air force directly control traffic between the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Its air force can intrude into the Philippine archipelago from its mandate in the South Seas, and has already invaded the Dutch East Indies and Borneo. Japanese officials brazenly regard themselves as the masters of the Philippines, treating the Philippine government and people with arrogance, just as they treat the Chinese government and people. Tokyo has repeatedly threatened the Philippines with a terrible fate if we have any movement opposing Japanese imperialism's interests in the Philippines. Their diplomats interfere strongly in Philippine internal affairs, even restricting our democratic rights, demanding the prohibition of our movements of sympathy and assistance to our heroic Chinese brothers. Japan has already regarded itself as the powerful master of the Philippines, only waiting for the opportunity to collude with Filipino rebels to turn the Philippines into a second Manchuria, Korea, or Taiwan.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot ignore this immense threat to national independence and security, because we bear a tremendous responsibility to our people and world democracy. Centuries of struggle for freedom, the heroic struggle against Spanish tyrants and American imperialism, the struggle to restore national sovereignty, the struggle to obtain more political freedoms, and the struggle to seek early national independence demand that we continue this spirit of struggle until we achieve complete freedom and liberation. The revolutionary martyrs Burgos, Rizal, Bonifacio, and Luna demand that we continue to wage a persistent struggle for freedom and democracy. The Communist Party of the Philippines has always revered these revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for independence, and believes that the common task is very sacred and must not allow irresponsible and adventurous ideas to mix into the independence movement. The Filipino people should take appropriate steps to ensure that they can protect themselves, defend the nation from Japanese aggression, and strengthen the forces of world democracy, so that the independence of the nation is based on democracy and security to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>2.  True and Guaranteed Independence</p>
<p>The Communist Party of the Philippines believes that the Filipino people cannot casually abandon their rights to self-determination and independence, because these rights were acknowledged through the Filipino people's long-term, heroic, and resolute struggle. The progressive government of the United States explicitly recognized in the Independence Act that the Philippines would be completely independent in 1946, after a plebiscite by the Filipino people. This is our victory, so we should defend it with the utmost enthusiasm. Because it is very clear that this right to independence is already under threat from fascist aggressors. We should exert our greatest efforts to defend these rights as a prerequisite for achieving the complete victory of democratic independence in the future. Whether we can maintain our rights to independence and whether we can obtain freedom does not depend on the Japanese fascist warlords and their allies, but on practical cooperation with the democratic countries of the world. Seceding from the United States does not stipulate that we immediately sever all relations with it. Whether the Filipino people are completely independent or whether we wait until 1946 should be determined by the special national environment in which we find ourselves. If waiting until 1946 to completely separate from the United States is more guaranteed, then in the current environment, immediately separating from all relations with the United States cannot guarantee the public greater democracy and true complete independence. Immediately severing all relations with the United States is equivalent to abandoning one of the largest democratic countries in the Pacific, causing serious setbacks to the nation's independence, peace, and security. The welfare of the Filipino people is based on cooperation with the United States and other progressive forces and democracy-loving people, and not on pleasing those fascists who attempt to invade the Philippines.</p>
<p>The tradition of the Filipino people, yearning for freedom, is the power of democracy; we must also be wary of those who advocate for immediate and complete independence at all costs. Whether these people are ignorant or ignorant tools of fascists, they are always urging us to blindly sever all relations with the United States. Fascist bandits are most adept at creating internal chaos and dividing the masses within the countries and nations they want to invade, for the sake of their aggression. These tools of Japanese fascism in the Philippines, under the guise of the slogan "Asia for Asians," exploit the Filipino people's desire for freedom, falsely claiming that Japanese fascism is a liberator of freedom. But the Filipino people will not and do not want to fall for this dangerous propaganda, because this dangerous propaganda has already enslaved several nations in East Asia and is continuing to carry out a conspiracy to conquer all of Asia. Those who carry out such propaganda among the Filipino people are being instigated by Japanese fascists to undermine and oppose the Philippine autonomous republic and the United States. The role they play is the same as that played by the tools of German fascism in Austria, allowing Germany to annex Austria. These Filipino fascist tools are traitors who betray the independence movement and are public enemies of the Filipino people. If their betrayal of independence is not stopped, it will sell out the Filipino people to the fascist warlords who rule Japan, forcing them to live like cattle under their iron hooves.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Communist Party of the Philippines opposes long-term bondage under the United States. American monopolists in the Philippines, with the support of a few Filipino sugar merchants and other businessmen, are tied to American interests and are taking advantage of the actual environment in which the Philippines finds itself to vigorously persuade the Filipino people to be ruled by the United States for a long time. But the main issue at present is not immediate independence versus long-term rule by the United States, but protecting the security of democratic countries against the aggression of fascist warlords. Therefore, we believe that under the current oppression of domestic and international reactionary forces, the Filipino people have no reason or need to blindly clamor for immediate independence, autonomy, expansion of the autonomous republic, and long-term rule by the United States. Under the current environment, under the Independence Act, we can strive for the welfare of the people, protect and expand democratic rights, and seek the early realization of national independence. Therefore, we strive to protect these stipulated Independence Acts, as well as the rights already obtained in the constitution of the Republic: a democratic republican system of government, a higher degree of self-government than we have enjoyed in the past, and recognition of the right to national independence. We should strive to defend these rights against the interference of domestic fascists and foreign aggressors. We strive to preserve the nation's wealth from being plundered by monopolists, and to protect and develop our resources and industries.</p>
<p>At the same time, before the implementation of the Independence Act, we should strive to expand democratic politics and seek fuller autonomy. In fact, the more the democratic relationship between the United States and the Philippines develops, the more it will enable the people of the two countries to cooperate in a friendly and voluntary manner. Under the current relationship, it is also possible to obtain fuller autonomy, seek the welfare of the Filipino people, and seek equal rights for Filipinos in Hawaii and the United States with Americans. If it comes time to amend the Independence Act, the Communist Party of the Philippines will encourage the Filipino people to establish a Philippine independent democratic republic, to form political treaties of friendship with the United States and Britain for the sake of mutual self-defense, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit in commerce. On this point, the Filipino people can vote in a plebiscite to decide, so that they can enjoy full rights.</p>
<p>3.  Struggle for Peace and Democracy Against Fascism and War</p>
<p>Our freedom issue cannot be separated from the issue of war and peace. We cannot bear to see our cities and villages subjected to the barbarous burning and killing of fascist aggressors, like the burning and killing in Guernica, Barcelona, Madrid, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xiamen, and Guangzhou in Spain. Some people tell us that if we continue to maintain such a relationship with the United States, the Philippines will become a target of attack by invaders and turn into a battlefield. Thus, according to their view, immediate and complete independence will guarantee our neutrality and prevent us from being drawn into the vortex of conflict. Do they really believe that Japanese fascists would not immediately seize the Philippines as a base for invading China, the Dutch East Indies, Indochina, and the United States? Are they not madly thinking that the Filipino people would submit without resistance under the iron hooves of the Japanese fascist warlords? We want to assure them that the Filipino people will bravely fight resolutely against fascist aggressors, just as they have fought for freedom in the past, and will stand on the side of democracy and progress to fight resolutely against reactionary fascism.</p>
<p>Although it is still possible to avoid the world war that fascist warlords are preparing for or have already launched, the way to avoid it is not to simply submit to their threats and aggression, but to actively inflict serious blows on the aggressors. In the past, China simply submitted to the threats and aggression of Japanese fascism, dreaming of sacrificing everything to seek compromise, and as a result, it lost Manchuria, created Japan's ruling position in North China, and continued to make unreasonable demands on the Chinese people. Only the great unity of the Chinese people formed on the basis of the united front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has a strong resistance, so that Japan has to pay a great price for every step it takes, and it has suffered several major defeats, showing the heroic fighting spirit of the Chinese people in front of the world, and making the world believe that the final victory belongs to China.</p>
<p>The great path to defending and restoring peace is a collective security system, with the peace-loving people of all countries cooperating to jointly punish the instigators of war. The reason why fascist warlords dare to be so arbitrary and tyrannical is due to the indecision and wavering of democratic countries, which fail to impose collective sanctions on aggressors in a timely manner. But the people of the democratic countries, especially the people of the United States, are eagerly demanding that the government adopt a collective security policy to sanction aggressors. The President of the United States also declared in his speech on October 5, 1937, that all the people of the Philippines should join the people of these democratic countries to jointly protect and promote the security system to sanction fascist aggressors.</p>
<p>It is no accident and not surprising that such reactionary forces opposed to progressives can be found among American isolationists, just as it is no accident that some people in the Philippines are clamoring for immediate and complete independence from the United States. For example, Congressman O'Malley is trying hard to play the role of an anti-imperialist, clamoring for the Philippines to take immediate action and adopt an isolationist policy. Senator Borah, the most reactionary leader of the Republican Party and the spokesman for monopoly capitalists, always opposes every new policy that is beneficial to the people and also demands immediate and complete independence for the Philippines. Hoover, the spokesman for big businessmen, pretends to be a demagogue who cares about democracy and freedom, using this to cover up his fascist face, attacking Roosevelt as a dictator, and at the same time, when American progressive forces are fighting, he tries his best to help the fascist forces launch a barbaric attack on the democratic forces. These reactionary fascist elements, monopolists, and big businessmen in the United States are fiercely plundering the American people's democratic rights and standard of living, and at the same time, they are the resistance that prevents the United States from adopting a collective security policy abroad. These elements are the masterminds and successors of the imperialist President McKinley who sent troops to seize our country when we were winning the revolutionary war for independence from Spain. It is also these elements who collude with fascist warlords to condone the Japanese, German, and Italian fascist lackeys, violating the will and wishes of the vast majority of the American people, dreaming of the victory of fascism. At the same time, these most reactionary elements are doing their best to instigate the Filipino people to separate from all relations with the United States and become independent at the present time, using this as a reason to demand that their government withdraw from the Far East and refuse to establish a collective security system and act in concert with democratic countries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the labor movement in the United States, which seeks to improve the living conditions of the people, and the democratic movement to defend democracy against fascists and monopolists, both support President Roosevelt's progressive policies and demand that he strengthen the power of the collective security policy to combat the instigators of war. These people have always been loyal to American democracy and continue the mission of the American People's Party and the Anti-Imperialist League. When McKinley sent troops to occupy the Philippines, they demanded that we be independent. The democracy-loving people in the democratic countries of the Western Hemisphere—Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the Latin American countries—have already united to fight for peace, democracy, and security against the fascist elements within these countries and the conspirators from fascist countries abroad. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy is intended to foster better relations between the United States and these countries and has been accepted and implemented by the people of these countries to counter reactionary fascism. The Filipino people are directly threatened by the brutal Japanese fascist warlords. In order to protect the nation's autonomy and guarantee future independence and security, they should form a democratic front with the people of the democratic countries of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The destiny of democracy and the independence movement are inseparable from all the pressing needs of the broad masses of the people, just as the struggle for freedom is inseparable from the struggle to improve the living conditions of the people. Therefore, full democracy should give the people the right to demand better living conditions and to fight for them. Once the people have full freedom to fight to improve their lives, the democratic forces will also be strengthened. Therefore, the government should not prohibit the people's movements, but should encourage them and give them practical assistance. Because the prevalence of mass movements can best guarantee democracy, defend national security, and establish a free democratic republic.</p>
<p>We are striving to pursue the free development of democratic political institutions, but fascists and adventurers and pro-Japanese elements are doing their best to harm them. These pro-Japanese elements and Franco's henchmen and supporters, the fascist-leaning monopolists in the Philippines, and some Filipino reactionary elements collude with each other to threaten to destroy Philippine democracy, forcing the Philippines to commit suicide and unite with the reactionary forces of the world, while using the issue of Philippine independence to attack progressive and democratic forces.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of the Philippines clearly points out that the main issue at present is the issue of democracy against fascism. We vow to stand at the forefront of the people and do everything in our power to defend democracy and eliminate the reactionary forces that attempt to harm it.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal of protecting and developing democracy and promoting independence, the Communist Party of the Philippines believes that a national organization is needed to defend the Philippine autonomous republic against aggressors. This is a necessary step to achieve a fully sovereign independent country. Our national defense construction should advance simultaneously with national industrial construction, so national defense construction can only be based on the level of economic development, otherwise it will increase the burden on the people. We should accept American technical and other assistance on the one hand, and emphasize upholding the collective security system as an effective strategy to stop aggressors and defend peace. Cooperating with the democratic and progressive forces in the United States with this strategy, and further cooperating with China, the Dutch East Indies, France, and especially the Soviet Union, which is willing and able to protect the security of the Philippines. Although the Filipino people can bravely resist aggressors, if we cooperate with these democratic countries, it can reduce our sacrifices and make it easier to defend our autonomous republic. Only those isolationists, who are willing to give away our country to Japanese imperialism for nothing, boast that the Philippines is already sufficient to defend itself and is not easily attacked. This statement is intended to deceive the Filipino people, making them unaware of the current danger and abandoning the policy of collective security. If we really follow these people's words, thinking that it is sufficient to take an isolationist policy, then the security of the Philippines will be in serious danger, and if the autonomous government implements such a dangerous policy, the result can only be an attempt to build up armaments that its national strength cannot afford. How dangerous is this!</p>
<p>However, while supporting national defense construction and the collective security system, the Communist Party of the Philippines particularly pointed out that the burden of national defense cannot be placed on the masses. When President Quezon first took office, Congress began to take all possible steps to amend the tax laws. Although progress is very slow, for the sake of national income and the happiness of the people, taxes on large corporations, inheritances, and high incomes should be increased, while reducing the burden on the poor.</p>

<h3>Supporting the War of Resistance and Unification - The 10th Anniversary of the Jinan Massacre</h3>
<p>Ten years ago today marked the beginning of Japanese ××-ism's armed intervention in the Chinese Revolution and the beginning of its armed invasion of China.</p>
<p>Ten years ago today was also the day the Chinese nation suffered the shame of humiliation under the pro-Japanese Huang Fu and others' line of humiliatingly seeking peace.</p>
<p>In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the National Revolutionary Army overcame Lincheng and advanced towards Jinan. The Japanese Tanaka Cabinet, in order to support feudal warlords and reactionary corrupt regimes to prevent the resurgence of the Chinese revolution and achieve its ambition of conquest, immediately decided to send troops to Shandong. It dispatched 50 warships and 50,000 soldiers, with Fukuda as the commander. On the 29th of April, the Northern Expeditionary Army of the National Revolution arrived at Jinan City, and Fukuda's interventionist army also arrived in Jinan that day to confront the Northern Expeditionary Army. On May 3rd, they actually launched an attack on the Northern Expeditionary Army and massacred civilians and soldiers. At that time, Cai Gongshi, the Special Commissioner of Foreign Affairs in Shandong, was brutally tortured for refusing the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side, his eyes were gouged out, his ears and nose were cut off, and then he and more than a dozen staff members of the diplomatic commissioner's office were shot to death. Starting on May 8th, they launched a general offensive, searching residents everywhere, looting property, massacring soldiers, and shooting pedestrians. More than 10,000 innocent civilians were killed. At that time, the pro-Japanese Huang Fu, under the pressure of the Japanese army, humiliatingly sought peace, agreed to all the demands of the Japanese army, and ordered the Northern Expeditionary Army to withdraw from Jinan. At that time, the revolutionary soldiers, although they had united with the workers in the city and the citizens in the nearby suburbs to oppose the humiliating treaty and bravely resist the Japanese army, finally retreated completely on the 11th with great sacrifices due to running out of ammunition and supplies.</p>
<p>From that day on, Japan dared to take large-scale military actions to invade China, ×××××, even affecting foreigners in China and their legal rights and interests. Also from that day on, every Chinese person began to recognize that the Japanese invaders colluded with Chinese feudal warlords, traitorous politicians, and all reactionary forces, and the angry tide of opposing Japan × and opposing traitors also began to surge in every city and village.</p>
<p>However, because there was no unity within China, because the policy of compromise and seeking peace by pro-Japanese elements in China had not been shattered, and especially because the people of China had not automatically and actively united to resist Japan × and traitors, the countercurrent of pro-Japanese traitors has been able to proceed unhindered for ten years, and the iron hooves of Japanese ×× have moved from Shandong Province to the three northeastern provinces, from beyond the pass to deep into our hinterland, ×××××, ××××, and all the tragic and unbelievable events have been continuously staged on our Chinese territory, until the Lugouqiao Incident in July and the Shanghai Incident in August two years ago, until the Kuomintang and the Communist Party declared cooperation and the whole country united to resist foreign aggression ×, the × behavior of Japan × and traitors encountered comprehensive and resolute resistance for the first time.</p>
<p>Ten years later today, the iron hooves of Japanese ×× have penetrated into various parts of our northern, central, and southern regions, and the bombing cannons of Japanese ×× ××××× have even plunged all our beautiful mountains and rivers, the embroidered fields, and the newly emerging cities into a bloody, terrifying, and dark state! As we reflect on the pain, we deeply feel that the following points deserve the attention of the whole country:</p>
<p>First, we must recognize that the Japanese invaders' attack is the implementation of a plan to destroy China that was decided as early as ten years ago. Their target is all of China, the entire Chinese nation, and every Chinese person who is unwilling to be a slave. The Japanese army's massacre of civilians and the killing of Mr. Cai Gongshi in the May 3rd Massacre in an attempt to eliminate our people's spirit of resistance is enough to imagine. Therefore, today we must step up our efforts to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence, mobilize the vital forces of the entire people, support the central leadership, strengthen national unity, persist in the war of resistance by the whole people, and strive for final victory.</p>
<p>Second, we must recognize that the Japanese invaders are the obstructors of the Chinese national liberation and rejuvenation movement. They try every possible means to attack our Chinese revolutionary movement and revolutionary forces in seeking independence, freedom, and equality. Because when our patriotic movement and revolutionary forces rise, the actions of the Japanese invaders will be subject to sanctions, so they try every possible means to eliminate our patriotic movement and revolutionary forces, first of all, to attack the leaders of this movement and forces. At the time of the May 3rd Massacre, they used the slogan of "preventing redification" to attack the Kuomintang's unification of China. Today, ten years later, they are still using the slogan of "anti-communism and anti-Chiang" to undermine the united front of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, today we must step up our efforts to resist this attempt by the Japanese invaders, and we must also strengthen our internal unity, and develop our patriotic movement and revolutionary forces. The first priority is to enrich and develop the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which lead China's war of resistance and national construction, and to consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese national united front. Only in this way can we effectively smash the × people's attempts.</p>
<p>Third, we must also recognize that in its destruction of the Chinese liberation and rejuvenation movement, the main strategy of the Japanese invaders is to use the political conspiracy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" in coordination with its military attacks. ×××× at that time was the beginning of the dual poisonous strategy of Japan × using both political and military means. At the time of Fushi, on the one hand, they used military force to assist feudal warlords and corrupt and reactionary regimes, and on the other hand, they used political conspiracies to exploit wavering and compromising elements in the revolutionary camp, especially pro-Japanese elements. Today, ten years later, they are not only using all the remnants of feudal forces, not only using all the dregs of the Chinese people, the backward warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians, but also using the wavering and compromising elements, stubborn and conservative elements, selfish and self-interested elements, and narrow-minded elements who do not understand the overall situation and do not care about the overall situation on the revolutionary and anti-Japanese front. They instructed ×× Wang Jingwei to advocate the anti-communist peace movement, although it has failed, but they are helping these traitors to establish a puppet central government and establish a puppet anti-communist army in an attempt to intensify the occupation of the occupied areas and intensify the conspiracy to destroy China, which has become even more serious! Therefore, we must not only fight against all feudal remnants, national traitors, and pro-Japanese traitors in action, but also fight against the words and actions that are lurking within the anti-Japanese front, intentionally or unintentionally spreading the "anti-communist peace" smoke screen for Japan × and hindering the war of resistance and national construction, theoretically and in all aspects. Only through vigilant and tenacious struggle can we overcome the × traitor's conspiracy and strive for final victory. Enhancing the strength to oppose traitors, puppets, and pro-Japanese elements, and enhancing the strength to oppose wavering and compromising elements, is the most urgent task at present.</p>
<p>"Do not forget the past, it is a lesson for the future." We would like to use the above three points to hope for the efforts of our government and various parties and groups, and to hope for the efforts of every Chinese compatriot who is unwilling to be a slave.</p>

<h3>Spiritual Mobilization Association Sends Telegram to the Whole Country; As National Monthly Meetings Begin, It is Hoped That Local Leaders Will Lead the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The National Spiritual Mobilization Association has sent a telegram to the mobilization committees of various provinces and, through them, to all compatriots in the country, saying, "Since the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu, his monarchs have never failed to train the people and the army has never failed to reiterate its respect. This is a clear effect of encouraging the spirit of the army and the people to achieve prosperity. As the national monthly meetings of spiritual mobilization begin, the chairman himself is taking the lead and giving detailed instructions, so the people of the country should be alert and understand thoroughly. In the lower echelons, we should deeply feel encouraged. National monthly meetings are a universal and regular task. The key to the success of spiritual mobilization is whether it can exert its highest efficiency in the coming month. The responsibility for supervision is entrusted to party, government, educational personnel, and fair-minded people in the locality. They should practice what they preach and set an example for the people, to uplift their own spirits and awaken national consciousness. The main point lies here. The supervision and assessment of higher-level mobilization agencies, as well as mutual observation, are essential components for promoting the work. We should also pay close attention to the fact that the second phase of the war of resistance is in full swing, and the great cause of nation-building is in the middle of the road. We must concentrate our spirits to overcome the difficulties. The advocacy of spiritual mobilization has a profound meaning, and we should make thorough plans at the beginning. We should strive to recognize the goals, abide by the outline, unite as one, and move forward with efforts. The victory or defeat in the future depends on whether we are diligent today. We must make a transformation to create a national atmosphere of strength and perseverance. We hope that we will encourage each other to achieve complete success." Secretariat of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association</p>

<h3>A Powerful New Force in the War of Resistance: North China Railway Demolition Team</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhengfei</p>
<p>This time, our country's heroic war of resistance began in North China. The North China battlefield was a month earlier than any other battlefield. However, it was the experience and lessons learned in this short month that allowed North China to make rapid progress. Whether in military affairs, political mobilization of the people, or even cultural education in the war zone, none were exceptions, and all unfolded with a new attitude.</p>
<p>The fact is clearly demonstrated that when the flames of war ignited at Lugou Bridge and set ablaze the entire country's resistance, due to the inferiority of our military equipment and the lack of experience in commanding large formations, the war situation in North China was in an extremely disadvantageous position. To the north, we lost Nankou in one battle, followed by the abandonment of Datong, Xinkou, and finally withdrew from Taiyuan and Linfen. To the south, we lost Baoding, Zhengding, abandoned Shijiazhuang, Niangziguan, and eventually opened Zhangde and Xinxiang... But no one could have imagined that in this critical situation, relying on our firm will to resist and our shattered mountains and rivers, we would rebuild a solid iron Great Wall. Not only did it stop the headlong rush of the **, but it also gave the ** countless serious blows. Even today, after one year and eight months, it has tied down a full ten divisions of the ** and more than 400,000 puppet troops, making the ** regard North China as its heartland. As for the various aspects of politics and economy, they have also been unexpectedly and rapidly reborn. When this reporter climbed over the Taihang Mountains, crossed one mountain city after another, the phenomena I saw were truly filled with endless joy and excitement. However, in this short dispatch, I will first introduce the North China anti-Japanese war's new railway demolition team, which is performing with a brand new attitude and using the most subtle power to give the ** the most serious blows.</p>
<p>This railway demolition team was spontaneously led by a Chinese worker ** who had participated in the European War. In the beginning, he only led fifty railway workers and more than twenty passionate young people, working hard. Now, it has developed into ** large teams, as well as personnel selected from the ** divisions to learn demolition work there, totaling over ****. Due to the establishment of this demolition team, the Daokou-Qinghua Railway has suffered the loss of 48 locomotives and 277 military, passenger, and freight cars. In the past year, the Daokou-Qinghua Railway has not been able to operate smoothly and safely. Finally, the ** people are unwilling to ride this "death train" and would rather walk on their two ** legs. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Meritorious Generals Promoted: Chen Cheng and Others Promoted to Second-Class Generals; National Government Order Issued Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] The National Government issued an order on the 3rd: (1) Lieutenant General Chen Cheng and Wei Lihuang, with the rank of Lieutenant General, are promoted to General, Second Class. This order: (1) Lieutenant Generals Zhang Zizhong and Sun Zhen are specially awarded the rank of General. This order.</p>
<h3>National Spiritual Mobilization Implemented: Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) I especially hope that all our compatriots living far away in the rear, such as in the Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou concessions, as well as overseas and in Hong Kong, especially our young men and women, must remember the enemies and humiliations of your country. In spirit, you must be self-reliant and strong. In life, you must be self-loving and self-respecting. You must be responsible and know shame. This is because I have heard reports from Chinese and foreign people from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou that there are still young people living in the concessions who are dancing, wandering, and do not know how to love themselves. I feel very heartbroken when I hear this. You should all know that you are lonely ministers and illegitimate children suffering under the oppression of the ** people, so you must be diligent, frugal, able to endure hardship and work hard, and especially take labor as your duty and service as your purpose. No matter where or when, you must be self-reliant and strong, and never be looked down upon by the ** people. More importantly, be respected by friendly nations. If they see that our young citizens can all understand etiquette, know integrity, have aspirations, have a sense of honor, and be diligent and thrifty, then they will have endless hope for the future of our country and will be able to enhance the personality of our country. This requires all our men and women across the country to unanimously fulfill the creeds of the National Spiritual Mobilization and practice the oaths of the National Covenant, which are: (1) Do not violate the Three Principles of the People; (2) Do not violate government laws and regulations; (3) Do not violate the interests of the country and the nation; (4) Do not be a traitor or a docile subject of the ** country; (5) Do not participate in traitor organizations; (6) Do not respect ** soldiers and traitor officers; (7) Do not work for the ** people and traitors; (8) Do not spy for the ** people and traitors; (9) Do not work for the ** people and traitors; (10) Do not use banknotes from ** people and traitor fake banks; (11) Do not buy goods from ** people; (12) Do not provide food and supplies to the ** people and traitors. In this way, we can arm ourselves spiritually, not be threatened by the violence of the ** people, not be tempted by the bait of the ** people, show our independence and self-reliance, not fear danger, and not be opportunistic in the face of difficulty, so that the ** people will be especially afraid and dare not look down upon and oppress us. In short, at today's critical juncture in the war of resistance, whether we are in the front or the rear, or even in any area that has fallen, we must implement national spiritual mobilization and strictly enforce the National Covenant, which is to thoroughly implement the new life of etiquette, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. From today onwards, everyone must make this determination and be worthy of being an independent and self-reliant citizen. Compatriots, you must also know that the spiritual mobilization movement cannot be effective with just five minutes of enthusiasm. We must persevere and become stronger over time, so we must be persistent and continuous. The purpose of spiritual mobilization is not only to encourage each of us to struggle hard today but also to create a new life and a new spirit for our nation through sustained training. We must constantly examine ourselves, sharpen ourselves, and spur ourselves on. Tang's inscription on the basin reads: "If you can renovate yourself for one day, then do so from day to day, and again from day to day." We must have this awareness and determination to constantly renovate, constantly struggle, and constantly strengthen our human and material resources to break the brutal and arrogant aggression of the ** people and realize our great Three Principles of the People. Fellow compatriots, you must know that today's spiritual mobilization and national covenant are our invisible guns and the ultimate planes and bombs. In other words, this spiritual mobilization and national covenant are also the greatest weapons of the war of resistance, and the organization of our National Monthly Meeting is the spiritual fortress of our anti-Japanese people. Therefore, we must thoroughly implement it and maintain it consistently. The effect of such vigorous implementation will definitely be more valuable and powerful than any steel and concrete fortresses. Therefore, after the start of the National Monthly Meeting, we must not follow the old ways of doing things as before. We must eradicate the bad habits of temporary perfunctoriness and responsibility, and we must implement the program regulations in a practical and down-to-earth manner. It must be known that the National Monthly Meeting is the morning bell for our spiritual reform. Today, the ** people are invading our China, committing rape, arson, and murder everywhere. They are worse than pigs and dogs. This shame is more painful than the hatred of killing one's father. Each of us should constantly ask ourselves: "Have you forgotten the great hatred of the ** people invading your country and massacring your compatriots? Have you forgotten the shame of the ** people seizing your land, bombing your houses, killing your fathers, sons, and brothers, and defiling your mothers, daughters, and sisters?" If we can constantly remind and encourage ourselves in this way, reflect on ourselves, and encourage each other, we will naturally not do such foolish things as living in a drunken dream and seeking temporary ease. We must also further think about the strange humiliation and deep pain we have suffered in the past fifty years, and we will surely be able to invigorate everyone and inspire everyone to achieve the goal of revenge, wiping out shame, resisting Japan, and building the country. From today onwards, after the National Monthly Meeting begins, I hope that not only can everyone be sincere, take the lead, and set an example, but also sincerely encourage and supervise each other. We must create a new atmosphere. On the one hand, the pillars of society must set an example and take the lead in advocating, and on the other hand, everyone must supervise each other, correct mistakes, persuade people to do good, and encourage each other. Today, if each of us is only concerned with our own well-being, we will be saving the country. We must recognize that if a compatriot or a colleague cannot implement spiritual mobilization, it is a disgrace to our entire country. We must embrace a heart of public loyalty and enthusiasm, and not only be responsible for ourselves and abide by discipline, but also encourage fathers and sons to encourage each other, and jointly supervise each other to promote it. We must strictly implement assessment and supervision, learn from each other, and promote the inherent noble and great spirit of our Chinese nation. I hope that from today onwards, a new atmosphere of universal development and revival will be created in the country. The previous dynasties of our province, even during the creation of the country, had a kind of hardworking, resilient, vigorous, and enterprising spirit, and a spirit of worry and vigilance. If this spirit does not decline, no matter what, the country will not perish. Looking at the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Five Dynasties, and the end of the Song and Ming Dynasties, the court and the public were filled with a kind of drunken, dreamy, selfish, and self-interested atmosphere, and a situation of emptiness, dispersion, division, and confusion. We must constantly think about the lessons of the rise and fall of past dynasties, recall the difficulties faced by our ancestors in building the country, and make up our minds to struggle and strive to fulfill the responsibility of wiping out shame and revenge. We must be deeply aware that the national disaster at this time is entirely the result of our generation's indulgence, decline, and unwillingness to compete. If our generation cannot avenge ourselves and wipe out shame, we will truly have no way to face our ancestors above, and no way to face our descendants below. Today, there are actually a small number of traitors and degenerates, and people with weak wills and lost spirits, who are engaged in shameless acts of selling out the country. This is truly a disgrace and misfortune to our country. But every descendant of the Yellow Emperor with ambition and vigor must be determined to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation, which is to be loyal to their responsibilities, loyal to their duties, loyal to the laws, and loyal to discipline, to fulfill our bounden mission of resisting Japan and building the country. The rise and fall of our country for centuries, and the honor and disgrace of our country for thousands of years, will depend on whether we can thoroughly implement the creeds of national spiritual mobilization in this revolutionary era that is difficult to come by in a thousand years, whether we can vigorously implement the rules of the National Covenant, and whether we can earnestly implement the program for resisting Japan and building the country. If we can all implement it, then we will surely be able to jointly and consistently unite our spirits under the three major goals of "the country above all else, the nation above all else; military affairs first, victory first; concentration of will, concentration of strength," to smash the aggressive policies of the ** people, realize our Three Principles of the People, and complete our great cause of revolutionary nation-building. Fellow compatriots, goodbye! (End)</p>

<h3>German-Polish Relations Grow Tense: Beck to Respond to German Demands in Two Days; Resolution to Use Force to Prevent Annexation of Danzig</h3>
<p>[Warsaw, Reuters, 2nd] The cabinet today passed a bill to grant the president additional financial powers to facilitate national defense matters.</p>
<p>[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to the Paris Evening News, before Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, delivered his speech, the Polish government sent a note to the German Foreign Ministry, conveyed by the Polish Ambassador to Germany, stating that the Polish government refused to negotiate with Germany on the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues.</p>
<p>[Warsaw, Reuters, 2nd] People here believe that Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, will deliver a speech in the Polish Parliament on Friday, responding to Hitler's speech, and will make counter-demands to Germany. Regarding the content of this demand, the Polish Ambassador to the United States has drafted a relevant statement, stating that Poland will demand guarantees of economic and other rights in Danzig.</p>
<p>[New York, Associated Press, 1st] The Polish Ambassador officially stated today that the Polish government has just issued a declaration, reiterating its determination to use force to prevent Germany from annexing Danzig. The Polish Foreign Minister will deliver a speech in Parliament on Friday to respond to Hitler's demands, and will also make counter-demands to Germany. The Polish Ambassador also said that Poland will maintain its position to the end and will not compromise.</p>
<p>[London, Associated Press, 1st] The Berlin correspondent of the "Daily Mail" reported that Hitler has given Poland fourteen days to respond to the demands he made in his speech last Friday, namely, to cede Danzig and for Germany to build a military road through the Polish Corridor directly to East Prussia. German newspapers have now intensified their attacks on Poland, especially focusing on Foreign Minister Beck. The German side is also constantly publicizing news of Polish people mistreating German expatriates. Diplomatic observers deeply believe that the current situation should be given close attention, and said that the gradual tension in German-Polish relations is deliberately created by the German side, and they want to take the opportunity to act swiftly. French political circles are closely watching Danzig, and French people are very worried about Germany's major attacks on Poland.</p>
<p>[Warsaw, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to well-informed sources, judging from the tone of the newspapers, Colonel Beck's speech will contain several sections attacking Germany. The semi-official "Polish Gazette" stated that if Danzig is returned to Germany, just like the Memel region, Poland's access to the sea will be cut off. Therefore, the Polish government may be forced to demand guarantees of the rights and interests of Polish people in the city. The "Polish Express" also has the same tone. The "Warsaw Transmission" reported that if Germany attacks Danzig, it will definitely not be as easy as taking the Memel region without spending a single soldier or bullet. However, if it is taken by force, a European war will break out.</p>
<p>[Berlin, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] Today, German newspapers commented on and refuted the new Polish demands regarding the Free City of Danzig, which were published in several Polish newspapers, saying that Poland's current tough attitude is the result of the guarantees made by Britain. The "Berlin Daily" stated that Germany had foreseen that Britain's guarantees to Poland would make the Polish government's attitude even tougher and would not be able to influence Poland to conduct reconciliation in an open and honest manner. The tone of Polish newspapers is nothing more than an expression of the Polish government's great desires.</p>
<p>Black Sea Group</p>
<p>French and Soviet Representatives Arrive in Turkey to Proceed; Soviet Union and Turkey to Join Peace Front</p>
<p>[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] General Weygand, the leader of the French delegation that went to Tehran to congratulate the Iranian Crown Prince on his wedding, arrived in Ankara yesterday and will discuss the current situation with Turkish political figures and meet with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin. French officials here attach great importance to Weygand's talks in Turkey and believe that they will do their best to persuade Turkey to join the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>[Ankara, Central News Agency, 1st] Diplomatic activities here have been very noteworthy in recent days. The Turkish President yesterday received Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin, French Ambassador Massigli, and former French Army Chief of Staff Weygand separately. Weygand also arrived here today, all wanting to prepare for the establishment of a Black Sea Pact between Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. If this pact is to be established, the issue of the Dobruja province between Bulgaria and Romania must be resolved (the province belonged to Bulgaria before the Second Balkan War and was assigned to Romania after the war).</p>
<p>[Ankara, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to political opinions here, General Weygand, the leader of the French delegation, will stay here for three days to discuss matters with the Turkish government, including the merger of Turkey and the Black Sea republics and the improvement of the Franco-Turkish agreement of July 1938.</p>
<p>[London, Associated Press, 1st] Negotiations to bring the Soviet Union and Turkey into the "Peace Front" are nearing completion. It is hoped that the results of negotiations in London, Paris, Moscow, Warsaw, and Ankara will enable thirteen active countries and four passive countries to form a united peace front, with Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Turkey as the main members.</p>
<p>Anglo-Soviet Talks</p>
<p>Discussion on the Overall Situation; British Parliamentarians Pay Attention to Japanese Actions</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] After returning from Moscow, Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax today. According to descriptions from Downing Street, the two had a "very long and extremely harmonious meeting." As for when the Anglo-Soviet talks will end, it has not yet been decided. It is heard that the participants discussed the overall situation involved in the recent negotiations, as well as the ways in which other countries cooperate in anti-aggression. Officials said that the British Ambassador to Poland did not discuss the implementation of British guarantees to Poland when he met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Warsaw, but only exchanged impressions of Hitler's speech, especially the part related to Poland, and the German proposals on the Danzig issue, as well as Poland's response. Authoritative sources also stated that the issue of British guarantees to Poland has been fully stated, and so far, no incident has occurred that would change or reduce its effectiveness.</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] Reuters diplomatic reporters have learned that neither side in the British-Soviet talks intends to involve the Far East. The goal of the talks is purely limited to Europe. British policy is to strengthen the strength of anti-aggression and to link with the Soviet Union, while also considering the opinions of Poland, Romania, and other countries. Another goal of British policy is to dispel Germany's so-called pretext of encircling Germany.</p>
<p>[London, Central News Agency, 2nd] During yesterday's meeting of the British House of Commons, members asked Foreign Undersecretary Butler whether Japan had notified the United States of the results of the recent German-Italian-Japanese talks. The Foreign Undersecretary replied no. In response to another question, he said that there were reports that Japan would also participate once the Axis powers were involved in the vortex of war. Foreign Secretary Halifax has paid attention to this. Another member asked whether what was reported in the newspapers was accurate. The Foreign Undersecretary replied that this was what was reported in the newspapers, and the government had not received a report.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, Reuters, 2nd] The "Kokumin Shimbun" here declared today that Japanese Ambassador to London Mamoru Shigemitsu warned British Foreign Secretary Halifax on the 27th of last month that the Japanese government was extremely concerned about Chamberlain's declaration that British-Soviet cooperation would extend to the Far East. It is heard that Shigemitsu also said that the United Kingdom's adoption of a united front with the Soviet Union in the Far East is the same as assisting the Chiang regime. Therefore, he requested that the United Kingdom abandon this policy. It is learned that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has replied that the British government has not adopted this policy and does not recognize the need to change the current policy towards China.</p>
<h3>Arab Brothers Sentenced to Death for Stabbing British Police Officer</h3>
<p>[Jerusalem, Reuters, 1st] The military court here has sentenced two Arab Muslim brothers to death after a three-day trial for the recent stabbing of a British police officer. The British police officer was killed while performing his duties on April 19.</p>

<h3>French Foreign Minister to Visit Britain</h3>
<p>[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to go to Southampton, England, on the 12th of this month, on behalf of the French government, to participate in the Franco-British Friendship Festival, which is hosted by the French Federation to promote French culture.</p>
<h3>Belgium to Borrow from France</h3>
<p>[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] Belgian Finance Minister Gutt and Commerce Minister Richard arrived here yesterday. According to political circles, the two Belgian political figures will conduct debt negotiations with the French Finance Minister to resolve Belgium's financial difficulties. In addition, diplomatic circles here are eager for the French government to agree to this loan, so that the friendship between the two countries will become closer. According to financial circles, if the negotiations are successful, it will also be a victory for French foreign policy and will enable neutral European countries to show sympathy for Western European democracy.</p>
<h3>Zetfield's Speech: Anglo-German Relations; If Germany Has No Plans to Invade, Britain Does Not Need to Guarantee Other Countries</h3>
<p>[London, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] Minister of Defense Coordination Zetfield spoke last night, talking about Hitler's speech, saying that all British people should be comforted to hear Hitler's words admiring the British Empire. He also said that Germany actually misunderstood British foreign policy. Once war breaks out, Britain does not have to be Germany's enemy. Britain has indeed guaranteed the security of several countries, but if we are sure that Germany has no plans to invade other countries, then the British government does not need to guarantee any country. At the same time, Britain and Germany do not have to meet in battle, but Britain does not want to infringe on the independence and sovereignty of other countries.</p>
<h3>Plane Crash: Female Aviator Injured; Pilot Also Missing</h3>
<p>[Prattville, Alabama, Reuters, 1st] Chinese female youth aviator Yan Yaqing (daughter of Dr. Yan Fu) is traveling around the United States for the war effort in her motherland. Today, the plane she was traveling in crashed near here, and she was seriously injured.</p>

<h3>Britain, France, and the United States Agree to Abolish Naval Treaty; German Note to Scrap Naval Agreement; Britain Temporarily Does Not Respond</h3>
<p>[London, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to this morning's report from the naval correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," the London Naval Treaty of 1936, signed by Britain, France, and the United States, will be completely abolished soon. This treaty imposed certain restrictions on naval expansion. Now that Britain wants to break free from these constraints, France and the United States have expressed full understanding of the British government's intentions.</p>
<p>[London, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to well-informed sources, the British government will temporarily not respond to Germany's note on the cancellation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, but will inform Germany within 48 hours that it has received the note.</p>
<h3>Palestine Issue: Cairo Proposes New Solution; British Cabinet Deliberated</h3>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] It is learned that the Cabinet deliberated this morning on a new proposal from Cairo regarding the resolution of the Palestine issue, but no decision will be announced until the White Paper containing the government's recommendations is published. Well-informed sources here believe that if the British side accepts Cairo's proposal, the representatives of the Arab countries will advise the leaders of the Palestinian Arabs to immediately stop terrorist activities and accept the British plan.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Asks Congress to Expedite National Defense Plans, Military Posts Established in Caribbean, Equivalent to Fortifying Panama Canal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] President Roosevelt has requested Congress to expedite the implementation of national defense plans, and authorize the government to immediately allocate $20,650,250 to expand the Army Air Corps and strengthen the defense of the Panama Canal. Simultaneously, the government is authorized to allocate an additional $70,497,500 to increase the purchase of military supplies. The President also requested an allocation of $185 million to purchase Army aircraft and Air Force equipment, and further authorized the government to allocate $60 million to aircraft manufacturing plants to contract for the increased purchase of aircraft. These two items total approximately $250 million, which, added to the $50 million already approved by Congress, reaches $300 million. This will expand the strength of the US Air Force to 6,000 aircraft. Regarding the Panama defense budget, the original amount was $27 million, but the President now requests that $22 million be allocated for immediate use.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The US Army Department has established military posts in the Caribbean Sea. This is tantamount to the United States establishing the first line of defense for the Panama Canal. President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the headquarters of the military posts will be located in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico. According to the US Army Department, the establishment of the military posts is under presidential order. From July 1st, the military facilities on the US-owned islands in the Caribbean and nearby islands, such as the Virgin Islands (part of the US West Indies), will be managed by the military posts.</p>
<h3>Britain Announces Conscription Bill, Reserve Force and Supplementary Military Bill Also Released, Rapidly Submitted to Both Houses of Parliament for Review, Validity Period to Be Set at Three Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] British Prime Minister Chamberlain formally gave the first reading to the Conscription Bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha also gave the first reading to the Reserve Force and Supplementary Military Bill.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The Conscription Bill, also known as the Military Training Bill, was released tonight and stipulates that the Navy and Air Force will also take a portion of the personnel called up for military service. It also authorizes the Navy Department to establish a special reserve unit to select personnel to join. The Air Force already has a special supplementary unit, so it is not necessary to establish another one. The bill stipulates that the British monarch may order the Cabinet to directly apply this bill to Northern Ireland and add some special provisions, but this will likely only occur during a special emergency or wartime. Irish citizens who "originally reside" in the United Kingdom, like citizens of other autonomous regions, are subject to the bill's constraints and may join the autonomous region's military. Those exempt from military service include: regular army personnel, those who have served in the military for six months seventeen years ago, those who have joined any reserve or supplementary force, and military school students. Approximately 200,000 personnel will be called up under this bill, to be summoned in four batches of 50,000 each. The bill also stipulates that employers should reserve the positions of employees called up for military service, with severe penalties for violators. There are also laws prohibiting the dismissal of employees approaching conscription age. If it is militarily necessary, privately owned land and buildings can be requisitioned, with procedures simpler than current ones. Those called up for military service will first train for six months, and then serve in the supplementary and reserve forces for three and a half years. Those aged 20 to 21 who have not registered for military service will be fined £5.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The Reserve and Supplementary Military Bill, recently released by the British government, simplifies the current legal procedures for calling up reserve forces. The bill authorizes the Navy, Army, and Air Force departments to call up reserve forces for defense when necessary, based on Cabinet orders. The Military Training Bill (i.e., the Conscription Bill recently passed) contains provisions for personnel allocation and penalties for workers who violate regulations. The Reserve and Supplementary Military Bill also has similar provisions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The Military Training Bill and the Reserve and Supplementary Military Bill have now been rapidly submitted to both houses of Parliament for review without delay. The second reading of the Military Training Bill will be debated in the House of Commons on May 4th, at which time Chamberlain will deliver a speech. The validity period for both bills will be set at three years. If deemed necessary, it can be extended by a Cabinet order for one year, or repealed midway.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] According to an official announcement, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon, at the invitation of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Home Secretary Hoare, departed for London tonight to discuss several issues related to Northern Ireland in the current Military Training Bill.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The National Labor Congress has appointed a subcommittee to draft a reasonable declaration expressing the Labor Party's opposition to the current adoption of conscription.</p>
<h3>Japan Refuses British Woman's Visit to Hankou, British Government Investigating</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] In the British House of Commons today, Conservative Party member Mr. Moore asked, that Mrs. Unwin, a British national, has repeatedly requested to enter Hankou to meet with her husband, but the Japanese military authorities have consistently refused. What is the outcome of the Foreign Office's review of this matter? Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied that the reasons for the Japanese authorities' refusal are still unknown and are currently being investigated. Mr. Moore then questioned, "Is the Minister aware that the Japanese side accuses Mr. Unwin of being anti-Japanese? After the Chinese army withdrew from Hankou, did Mr. Unwin not assist in removing the bombs buried by the Chinese army? Is this not sufficient proof that the Japanese claims of anti-Japanese sentiment are unfounded?" The Foreign Under-Secretary replied that the government will consider these facts when investigating the matter.</p>
<h3>Hull's Remarks: Germany Sends Hitler's Speech, Cannot Be Considered a Reply</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Hull stated today that the German action of only sending a copy of Hitler's speech to the US Embassy cannot be considered a formal reply to President Roosevelt's peace telegram. Hull added that the German Foreign Office sent a copy of the speech to the US Embassy, followed by a telephone notification that this was the German reply. Hull also stated that regarding Romania's debt to the US war, he expects Romania to propose a solution within a few days.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek's "May First" Address</h3>
<p>On May 1st, the National Spiritual Mobilization was universally implemented throughout the country, the National Covenant was strictly enforced, and National Monthly Meetings were held. The Supreme Leader President Chiang Kai-shek also gave a nationwide broadcast address, with earnest and sincere words that were inspiring and added to one's courage to fight for national and personal dignity.</p>
<p>We, who have escaped the bombing, robbery, rape, and pillage of the × people and are living under the power of foreigners, feel particularly moved and wish to especially bring the following three points to the attention of our overseas compatriots after carefully considering the leader's address:</p>
<p>First, President Chiang Kai-shek expressed deep concern for compatriots in the occupied areas. He also expressed deep respect and love for the arduous struggles of compatriots in the occupied areas. He said: "You endure hardship and persist in struggling to the death under the iron heels and violence of the × people, striving to uphold the various aspects of our Chinese national character. Every time I and all the soldiers and compatriots hear that you have killed a × person or burned a × product, we are more moved and happier than receiving news of victory from the front lines. Because your effect of killing a × person behind the × people's lines (that is, in our occupied areas) is greater than the effect of killing one hundred × people at the front!" These few words from the Supreme Leader not only make the people of the whole country pay more attention to and work harder in the battle behind the × people's lines; not only enable all the warriors in the occupied areas to work harder and redouble their efforts, but also can more seriously attack Wang Jingwei's poisonous plot of fighting guerrilla warfare after ×; and can also more solemnly point out the illusion of some reporters and people who underestimate the battle results in the occupied areas. In the future, we will not only add respect to the struggle of the Eighth Route Army in North China and the New Fourth Army in Central and South China, but also organize, enrich, and expand the vast rear of the × people with redoubled efforts.</p>
<p>Second, President Chiang Kai-shek expressed great sorrow for the young people residing in the concessions of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou who dance around and wander without self-respect, and solemnly and earnestly declared to the whole country: "You should all know that you are a troubled and miserable orphan under the oppression of the × people, so you should be especially diligent and thrifty, hardworking and enduring, and especially take labor as your duty and service as your purpose. No matter where or when, you must be self-reliant and strong, and never be despised by the × people, but also be respected by friendly people." We believe that these words are like the admonitions of a loving father with blood and tears, and also like the admonitions to our compatriots living abroad, especially in Hong Kong. We know that in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and even Hong Kong, there are still many young people fighting for the motherland in hardship, and the situation is so moving and inspiring, but most of the "high-class Chinese" still live their extravagant and depraved lives without shame. The personal fall of such behavior is a small matter, but the damage to the reputation of the country and nation is great. Therefore, after carefully considering the leader's address, we not only hope that everyone will "repent if you have done wrong, and encourage yourself if you should," but also hope that everyone will use the power of organization and the power of public opinion to impose effective and strict sanctions anywhere and anytime. We must "not be despised by the × people, but also be respected by friendly people. And be able to improve the personality of our country!"</p>
<p>Third, President Chiang Kai-shek expressed infinite pain and anger at the actions of the × people and traitors, painfully stating that the × people "invade our China, rape, kill and burn everywhere, treating our Chinese people worse than cattle, horses, pigs, and dogs. This kind of humiliation is more painful than the hatred of killing a father." He further painfully stated that the traitors and pro-Japanese factions are doing the "shameless deed of selling out the country," "unable to face their ancestors above, and unable to face their descendants below." Therefore, he wants each of us to constantly ask ourselves, "Have you forgotten the great hatred of the × people invading your country and massacring your compatriots? Have you forgotten the shame of seizing your land, bombing your houses, killing your fathers, sons, brothers, and defiling your mothers, daughters, and sisters?" We men and women compatriots who have escaped from the bombing and looting of the × people, we overseas compatriots who have preserved our lives under the power of foreigners, we should follow the instructions of the leader. We should not only constantly reflect on ourselves!</p>
<p>Spiritual mobilization is not a idealistic empty talk, but a practical movement to mobilize the strength of the entire nation to support the war of resistance and national reconstruction. We must follow the leader's May 1st address, and we must use practical actions to support the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan and build the country to realize the national spirit. Every compatriot who is unwilling to be a slave must not only do this himself, but also make the people around him do this! (Lang)</p>

<h3>An Unprecedented Feat in the Hong Kong Drama Scene, The Great National Revolutionary Historical Drama "Huanghuagang" Premieres Tonight, Three Consecutive Nights at the Taiping Theatre, Three Hundred Actors, Fundraising for the Relief Association to Support the Families of Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper: The seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang rang the blood bell of revolution with their lives. In order to fight for the freedom and liberation of the people, they had the heart to bid eternal farewell to their parents, wives, and children. Although the martyrs are dead, their heroic spirit will last forever. When we recall the passing of the martyrs, how tragic and moving it is, causing us to shed tears. Amidst the emotion and tears, we sincerely admire the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the martyrs, and we heartily realize how heavy the task of those who survived is!</p>
<p>But what is the Republic of China that the Huanghuagang martyrs created with their blood and heads like? Rampant corruption, internal strife, and external remorse are unbearable to look back on. If the martyrs were aware, how could they rest in peace under the nine springs? This historical grievance and blood debt, until the start of the war of resistance, was finally thoroughly settled by our heroic soldiers with blood and heads.</p>
<p>Look! The heroic soldiers in the war of resistance are comparable to the martyrs of Huanghuagang, who came before. In order to rebuild China and "fight for national freedom and liberation," they finally "had the heart" to "bid eternal farewell to their parents, wives, and children." Only we who steal our lives and enjoy the fruits of their labor, only we who still have parents, wives, and children to look after, how ashamed should we be, how ashamed! In order to slightly reduce the unease within, in order to atone for one in ten thousand, performing "Huanghuagang" to raise funds to comfort the families of soldiers killed in the war of resistance is such a meaningful event.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Huanghuagang Revolution is the most tragic and greatest historical event of the Chinese nation, and is the prelude to this sacred war of resistance. The completion of the "Huanghuagang" revolutionary historical drama is the unprecedented work of twenty-two former writers. Today, when the war of resistance is in full swing and the light of victory is already shining in front of us, performing "Huanghuagang" to praise the spirit of the martyrs who gave up their lives to achieve benevolence and spread their names to future generations is intended to raise funds to comfort the families of soldiers killed in the war of resistance -- their parents, wives, and children whom they had the heart to bid farewell to -- in order to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven and to encourage those who are alive to move forward on the bloody path. This is indeed the duty that we who are alive cannot shirk.</p>
<p>Under this great and sacred call, the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Association has painstakingly shouldered the heavy responsibility of hosting the performance. More than thirty drama troupes and more than three hundred backstage workers in Hong Kong have achieved unprecedented unity and are dedicating themselves to the drama for the sake of the country and to comfort the dead. More than twenty choral groups, totaling one to two hundred singers, will perform the magnificent songs together with the great "Huanghuagang" -- all the newspapers in Hong Kong have broken new ground and unanimously published special editions to promote the performance with advertisements. All of these are unprecedented efforts and unity, writing a fresh page in history in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"Huanghuagang" was originally scheduled to be performed on the Flower Festival, but due to insufficient preparation and review arrangements, it was decided to perform it at the Taiping Theatre for three consecutive nights, starting today. This can further symbolize that although the Huanghuagang flowers have fallen, our memories and admiration for the martyrs will forever linger in our minds.</p>
<p>"Huanghuagang," a great revolutionary historical drama in four acts and six scenes, has more than one hundred actors. Together with the backstage workers, there are more than three hundred people, making the scale of the performance grand and the content wonderful, which goes without saying. The complexity and realism of the props and costumes also go without saying. This unprecedentedly great script, unprecedentedly great performance, unprecedentedly great unity, unprecedentedly great lineup, and unprecedentedly great service, how worthy are they of our praise and respect!</p>
<p>The directors Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Lin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi, and other pioneers of drama movement, are all well-known experts in the drama world. For a month, they have carefully designed, diligently led, and directed without sparing any effort. The main actors of the China Travel, China Art Times, and other drama troupes have all taken on the leading roles in "Huanghuagang." The other actors are also the best chosen from various drama troupes in Hong Kong. Tonight's performance is bound to be a resounding success.</p>
<p>For more than a month, the play has been actively rehearsing at South China Middle School and China Art Troupe. The work is proceeding very intensely. The Relief Association's "Huanghuagang" Performance Special Committee has painstakingly prepared all the arrangements and is ready. A final preview will be held at the Taiping Theatre at noon today. Now, only one question remains: we, the Japanese compatriots in Hong Kong, must enthusiastically watch "Huanghuagang."</p>
<p>The ticket prices are set at four categories: five dollars, three dollars, one dollar, and thirty cents. Considering the strength of each person's contribution, how can there be any excuse to refuse? The martyrs shed blood to fight for national freedom and liberation, and the actors and workers have been working tirelessly to prepare, forgetting to eat and sleep. We have the opportunity to see the most advanced theatrical art and to receive the rare opportunity to be baptized by revolution. Is there still any room for stinginess?</p>
<p>Remember, remember, remember, starting today for three consecutive nights (7:30 PM to 12:00 AM) the premiere of "Huanghuagang," the greatest revolutionary historical drama at the Taiping Theatre. Remember, remember, remember, this is to raise money to comfort the families of soldiers killed in the war of resistance.</p>

<h3>Good News Amidst the Firewood Shortage, Two Thousand Tons of Vietnamese Firewood to Be Shipped to Hong Kong, A Firewood Merchant Writes to Taikoo Bureau to Charter Ships, Hong Kong Authorities Agree to Waive Taxes and Lend Land for Storage</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese invasion of South, the transportation between Hong Kong and the mainland has been cut off, and the firewood supply on which this place depends has also been severely affected. The market price has suddenly soared, with only fifty odd catties per dollar. When Jiangmen fell, the problem became even more serious. Therefore, the general residents are all calling out in pain, and merchants in Nanyang and Vietnam, seeing the profit to be made, are flocking to Hong Kong to sell. It is noted that a Vietnamese gentleman surnamed Huang recently transported 2,000 tons of mountain firewood to Hong Kong, but because the quantity was too large, there were not enough ships for transportation at one time. Yesterday, he specially wrote to the Taikoo Ship Bureau to discuss chartering ships. It is reported that the merchant has been granted permission by the Hong Kong authorities to borrow land for storage and waive various taxes. After the batch of firewood arrives in Hong Kong, it will definitely be sold at a low price, and the firewood shortage problem in Hong Kong can be largely solved.</p>
<h3>Waters Near Humen Head, Firewood Boat Robbed, Eight Thieves with Sharp Weapons, One Thief Holding a Hand Grenade, Firewood Valued at 1300 Dollars Looted</h3>
<p>The waters bordering China and England have always been a den for pirates. Recently, due to the current situation, pirates have become even more active and rampant. Ships traveling between Hong Kong and the mainland are often robbed by pirates mid-journey. At 3:00 PM yesterday (1st), another firewood boat registered with the Hong Kong Ship Administration Office, No. 1261, was robbed by nine pirates in the Chai Zhou waters off Humen Head. Yesterday morning, the boat owner, Zhang Yao, returned to Hong Kong and went to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station to report the case. According to him, he left the Chinese boundary on the morning of the 1st of this month, fully loaded with firewood, totaling ninety-four piculs, intending to transport it to Hong Kong for sale. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, when he sailed to the Jiangzhou waters opposite Humen Head, he suddenly saw a pirate boat flying over. The boat was carrying nine pirates, eight of whom were holding long and short guns, and the other was holding a grenade. They shouted for our boat to stop. I and my companions saw that the thieves were all holding murder weapons and were extremely fierce, so we had to obey and stop to avoid misfortune. The pirate boat drove alongside our boat, and eight thieves boarded the boat and threatened us, forcing us to drive the boat to the shore, driving us ashore, and the thieves drove our boat away. We had no choice but to return to Hong Kong on foot. The loss was ninety-five piculs of firewood, worth $150, the boat itself was worth $1200, and several sets of clothes were worth $3, totaling $1353. The duty officer at the station, upon receiving the report, immediately filed the case and telegraphed the various district bureaus to search for the culprits.</p>
<h3>Residents Attention! Cholera Strikes Hong Kong Again, Free Cholera Vaccinations</h3>
<p>"Cholera," the prevalent epidemic in the Far East, has struck Hong Kong again. In order to prevent the spread of cholera, the local health authorities have launched a prevention campaign, urging citizens to get vaccinated quickly and pay attention to diet, especially drinking water, milk, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish, and ice cream, to avoid infection. Due to the dense population, the spread of cholera is particularly worrying in Hong Kong. In the past two years, there have been as many as 1,446 deaths, a shocking number. The symptoms of cholera are abdominal pain and vomiting, and the only way to prevent it is to be careful with your diet. The validity period of the vaccine is limited to only five months. If you are not careful with your diet, you may still be infected even after being vaccinated. This point must be noted. The health authorities have organized free vaccinations. Citizens who wish to be vaccinated can go to the following locations, where doctors will vaccinate them free of charge. The free vaccination locations are as follows: Queen Mary Hospital, Old National Hospital, Tung Wah Hospital, Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, Kowloon Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital, 105 Third Street, Medical Bureau in Western District, Shek Qu Lane, Wanchai Medical Bureau, Ap Lei Chau Street Central Public Medical Bureau, Shau Kei Wan Hospital, Gansu Street Yau Ma Tei Medical Bureau, Kwun Yum Street Hung Hom Medical Bureau, Medical Bureau Street Sham Shui Po Medical Bureau, Kowloon City Medical Bureau, Mrs. Bay Health Center, Central Fire Station, Kowloon Old Government Affairs Bureau, Yuen Long and Tai Po Medical Bureau.</p>

However, Pan American has not yet received the news. Tyrone Power has starred in many films, including successful ones such as "In Old Chicago," "Alexander's Ragtime Band," and "Marie Antoinette."

<h3>Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Issues Annual Report Yesterday; The Number of British Rubber Shoes Shipped to Hong Kong is Astonishing; Totaling Over 5.4 Million Pairs Last Year; British Manufacturers Severely Affected and Unable to Compete</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce issued its annual report for last year the day before yesterday, with a detailed report on the Hong Kong rubber shoe industry. It stated that the British rubber shoe industry had been quite prosperous since 1924, but was later hit by the dumping of Japanese goods. After the government imposed heavy import taxes, Japanese goods were unable to be sold. However, after the Japanese goods were frustrated, Hong Kong rubber shoes took the opportunity to be exported to Britain. Hong Kong products, due to preferential tax treatment, were much cheaper in price, and British products were unable to compete with them. This year, British manufacturers sent a representative, [Mr. So-and-so], to Hong Kong to try to reach a gentleman's agreement with Hong Kong manufacturers to voluntarily limit the amount of imports so that British products could regain some market share. Otherwise, British manufacturers, for the sake of their own interests, would take action to cancel or change the preferential tax treatment. The report stated that between 1934 and 1936, Hong Kong shipped about 2 million pairs of rubber shoes to Britain. By 1937, it had increased to 4.54 million pairs, and from 1938 to September, it had reached 5.428 million pairs. British manufacturers were even more panicked as a result. After the British manufacturers' representative arrived in Hong Kong, they further demanded that Hong Kong products increase their prices by one-tenth and voluntarily limit the amount of imports for a period of two years, with the annual amount decreasing: 4 million pairs of summer cloth shoes, 500,000 pairs of raw rubber crepe-soled shoes, 250,000 pairs of rubber shoes, and no other rubber shoes to be imported. In the opinion of the Chamber, this condition cannot be accepted because the British rubber shoe industry is more affected by high-quality Canadian shoes and less affected by Hong Kong shoes. However, the committee believes that maintaining price levels is beneficial to both Britain and Hong Kong. The report also advocated that Hong Kong manufacturers should control production.</p>
<h3>Major Theft Occurs on Peel Street; Over 600 Hong Kong Dollars Stolen</h3>

Then, the discussions began: (1) The Boluo Relief Association's request submitted at the last general meeting: (A) The request to allocate funds to open a literacy class for child refugees. The standing committee proposed that, given the association's limited funds, the matter should be reconsidered after fundraising. Future requests for funds from relief organizations will be handled in the same way. The resolution was passed. (B) The request to allocate rice and transportation costs to relieve refugees. The standing committee proposed that the matter be referred to the investigation department for further consideration. The resolution was passed.

<h3>Tragedy Occurs at the Queen's Hotel Yesterday; Two Young Women Commit Suicide by Poison; One From Macau, One Quietly Arrived; Lysol Sent Two Souls to Heaven</h3>
<p>A tragic suicide by poisoning occurred at the Queen's Hotel on the third floor yesterday. It was found that a traveler named Liao Zhen (28 years old) from Room [So-and-so] on the third floor of the Queen's Hotel at 159 Des Voeux Road Central had checked into the hotel the day before. She only had a swimming basket as luggage. She said she was from Macau. Before the incident occurred, the traveler had shown no other signs, so the waiter did not pay attention to her. It was not until about 5:00 PM yesterday that a young woman named Liao visited her. At 6:30 PM, the hotel manager noticed that there was no sound in the room, suspected something was wrong, and called for the door to be opened. However, after several minutes, there was no sound. The hotel manager informed the hotel owner and broke down the door. When they discovered the two women, they were already dead. The people in the hotel reported the incident to the police station and asked them to send a hearse to take the two bodies to the public mortuary. According to the people in the hotel, the two women committed suicide by taking Lysol.</p>

<h3>Mr. He Xiangning Writes a Special Poem for This Publication… Special Issue on the Joint Performance of 'Huanghuagang' by the Hong Kong Drama Community; A Lesson: The Performance of Huanghuagang</h3>
<p>— Cai Chusheng</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Association, more than 30 organizations and more than 300 drama workers have been mobilized to raise funds to comfort the families of fallen soldiers on the front lines by performing the great revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang." This is not only an unprecedented feat in Hong Kong, but also a rare event in mainland China, such as in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou, where drama workers have gathered in large numbers in the past!</p>
<p>We should especially point out that the significance and role of this joint general performance are not only to raise a sum of money to fulfill some of the responsibilities that our rear-area people should fulfill, but also a work of epoch-making significance in the Hong Kong drama and cultural movement.</p>
<p>We know how difficult it has been in the past for Hong Kong drama workers to establish a sound overall organization. This deeply reflects that our work still retains various unnecessary concepts of "sects," "factions," and "boundaries," which have led to division and fighting on our own. This will cause great damage to the entire drama movement.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that it seems too early to demand unity of will, consistency of pace, and organic coordination with the needs of the objective environment, with the most sensitive actions, rapid reflection, and rapid results from the Hong Kong drama and cultural movement, which is just beginning to sprout and has not yet fully entered its vigorous period. Perhaps there are some reasons for this. However, in our contact with some of the mechanisms of various drama groups, in addition to many things that deserve our respect and need not be said, it is also easy to find various errors in content and form. Works such as "art for art's sake," "love for love's sake," and "feudal consciousness" are still being staged, and the techniques of "civilized drama" (I have seen a few small theater groups that are indeed suspected of having this problem) are still being used. The existence of these shortcomings not only makes it impossible to "thrive," but also kills the "sprout." As for its role—effect—it is naturally directly proportional to this. How worthy of attention this is!</p>
<p>In "peaceful times," perhaps we can "each do what we see fit" and let them develop in a scattered manner. However, in the current situation, everything is changing so rapidly that we need to turn all cultural tools into effective weapons at all times. Even a country bumpkin who has received a few days of training as a conscript wants to go to the front line. We really have no time to wait any longer! In the sacred struggle for national freedom and liberation, apart from traitors and [Japanese], even enemies can be known as confidants. What's more, there are erroneous concepts of "sects," "factions," and "boundaries." Therefore, in addition to singing the praises of this performance with the greatest respect, I also sincerely hope that this great performance will enable the various drama fighting units to have a better understanding of each other, a better understanding of the road ahead, and to break down some unnecessary prejudices, and to continue the spirit of this great gathering, and to quickly establish a sound overall connection!</p>
<p>We know that the progress of all cultural departments is due to criticism and supervision. We cannot let errors continue. We cannot let those who have made progress stop because of "satisfaction." We cannot let the scattered status quo remain scattered. We should have strict collective criticism and supervision. We want to use the flowers of drama in Hong Kong, which was once a "deserted island," to go from "sprouting" to "thriving" to "flourishing" under a rigorous collective action!</p>
<p>In addition to paying the greatest respect to the workers who participated in this performance, I also hope that the performance of "Huanghuagang" will be a milestone in the era of Hong Kong drama and cultural movement! Written hastily on the night of May 2nd.</p>
<h3>Starting From the First Performance of Huanghuagang in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Situ Huimin</p>
<p>A year ago, when Huanghuagang was first performed in Guangzhou, I happened to catch up with that heated atmosphere. Time passed quickly, more than a year ago. At that time, the warm taste of spring in the south was no different from before, and the sky above the tomb of the Huanghuagang martyrs. Maybe it's still the same now? However, the heated situation at that time can only be deeply left in our memories now. In the past year, the war of resistance has shifted from the first stage to the second stage, Guangzhou has fallen, and Huanghuagang and the place where Huanghuagang was first performed have been occupied by the enemy. If that theater has not been bombed into ruins now, perhaps the [Japanese] are grinning and having fun there. A year, a full year, the impression is still clear. When Huanghuagang was first performed in Guangzhou, playwrights from Guangzhou and playwrights who worked in Guangdong from various places participated in the writing of that great historical drama together. Under extremely rapid and excellent work, the script was produced and all the actors in Guangzhou participated in the performance, mobilizing a large number of citizens to participate in this performance meeting. That day, March 29, 1938, the evening of the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, there was a torch parade in the city. The Taiping Theater in Xijiayuan performed this meaningful Huanghuagang. Under the threat of bombing by [Japanese] planes, the alarm had not yet been lifted, and our drama began to be performed amid enthusiastic applause from the audience. How many times in the history of Chinese drama movement can we get this large-scale and united performance? This drama showed the citizens of Guangzhou more than 20 years ago the great difficulties in creating the Republic of China with the sacrifice of the martyrs' hot blood and heads, and inspired the citizens of Guangzhou to defend the results created by the elite martyrs in times of crisis, and to defend the glorious land that promoted the voice of revolution. That day, during the performance of Huanghuagang in Guangzhou, the audience enthusiastically shouted, "In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, we must step up the defense of Guangdong!" But a year, a year later today, we commemorate that lost glorious land in deep grief, and the heated situation of Huanghuagang's performance in Guangzhou in mournful memories also makes us miss the respectable Guangzhou theater comrades who participated in the work at that time. Now they are either sacrificed under the bombing of the [Japanese] to defend that glorious land, or dispersed to various places, hoping to spread the undying seeds of drama everywhere, so that the spirit of great unity among drama workers can grow in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Huanghuagang was brought to Hong Kong and taken over by the theater workers staying in Hong Kong for performance. This time, it is also a large-scale and united performance in Hong Kong. It includes all the drama workers in Hong Kong, as well as comrades who participated in the first performance in Guangzhou. Its significance should not be less than that of last year. The more fierce the [Japanese] attack, the more we can only strengthen the meaning of drama. When it was first performed in Guangzhou, we shouted, "In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, I will step up the defense of Guangzhou," but at present, a year after its first performance, the drama significance should be "In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, we must step up the counterattack against the enemy, and win back that lost glorious land, step up the counterattack against the [Japanese], and win back the theater where Huanghuagang was first performed, and wash away the shame of the [Japanese] insulting the martyrs' graves. I hope that the drama work comrades and the overseas Chinese compatriots staying in Hong Kong will encourage themselves with this united performance.</p>
<p>This year's performance of Huanghuagang also has a point that should be especially clarified. When Huanghuagang was performed last year, our anti-[Japanese] camp was still sneaking in traitors and [Japanese] who were disguised as patriots [censored]. They hung up the signboard of the old revolutionary party and deceived everywhere, acting as lobbyists for the enemy. But now this conspiracy has been broken, and Wang [Jingwei] embarked on the path of China's national revolutionary struggle in the same era as the Huanghuagang martyrs, but the martyrs sacrificed themselves [censored], glorious sacrificers, to make the Chinese people live a more tragic life of slavery than in the Manchu Qing autocratic era. Now everything has been revealed. When we are performing this Huanghuagang heroic epic in Hong Kong, these national revolutionary traitors who are plotting to sell out the party and the country are fleeing the borders of the war of resistance. Now they are carrying out large-scale activities everywhere, communicating with the [Japanese] publicly and semi-publicly. In order to strengthen the significance of the performance of Huanghuagang, we should especially clarify this significance to the overseas Chinese: In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, we must step up the eradication of traitors who betray the martyrs and sell out the party and the country, traitors in disguise [censored].</p>
<p>This large-scale and united performance of Huanghuagang in Hong Kong. Its significance in the drama movement goes without saying. This time, it created a historical record in the history of Chinese overseas drama performance. It can only be realized in the current stage and era of the war of resistance. In the past, there was a lack of contact between theater workers, and various private opinions were maintained between the people and individuals, and between groups and collectives. However, these shortcomings have been improved in the course of the long-term war of resistance. This performance, combined with the initial Guangzhou Huanghua Two performances in history, makes those who cannot unite abandon their former relationships. The drama work comrades should carry forward the valuable fact and consolidate it with blood. May 1, late at night.</p>
<h3>Also an Example</h3>
<p>— Xia Yan</p>
<p>The moment I knew that friends in the Hong Kong drama circle were planning to stage "Huanghuagang," I didn't want to be pretentious, I couldn't get rid of a vein of dim, unbearable memories. Is the situation at that time last year not as clear as yesterday? And this year, dozens of people gathered to create the "Huanghuagang" script on the third floor of the Guohua Bank on Yonghan Road, and hundreds of people busy rehearsing in the Education Association Auditorium, those little friends who were busy nailing the scenery that once appeared, that one attracted tens of thousands of viewers The Taiping Theater, and even the master of this script—the tomb of the 72 martyrs who signed the Guangdong revolutionary spirit, are they not all occupied, dispersed, and trampled on by [Japanese] hooves?</p>
<p>However, the revolutionary spirit of Guangdong will not disappear because of temporary failures, setbacks, and occupations. The comrades who created and performed "Huanghuagang" are not to mention on the front lines of Guangdong, and those who have temporarily retreated to Hong Kong are still continuing to take the weapon of drama to [censored]? The main tactic of the second phase of the battle is to "attack the heart." Although "Huanghuagang" is not a complete work of art, it has a sharp use in the tactics of [censored] "attacking the heart."</p>
<p>In the moment before victory is about to arrive, we will often encounter the most difficult, the most unbearable environment. The martyrs of Huanghuagang used their own flesh and blood to break through the temporary difficulties and expressed to the national public an example of the confidence that the revolution will succeed. Use this example to combat all those who attempt to surrender and change their stance in times of difficulty.</p>
<h3>"The Chinese Are Indeed Geniuses"</h3>
<p>— Gao Changsheng</p>
<p>For the staging of "Huanghuagang," Mr. Lu Fu asked me to request Mr. Guo Moruo to write an article, but timing-wise, it's already too late. "The Chinese Are Indeed Geniuses" is an article written by Mr. Guo for the Chongqing premiere of my humble work "One Year of Carrying," but the content broadly discusses Chinese drama and culture, so let's publish this article once in Hong Kong. Xia Yan. May 1st.</p>
<p>"The Chinese are indeed geniuses," these were the words of an old Japanese writer, Akita Ujaku, to me.</p>
<p>It was the spring of the year before last, when I was still living in Tokyo, Japan. Some of the students studying abroad were going to perform Qu Qiubai's "Sunrise." Playing the female lead was Miss Feng Hezi, who had just graduated from Fudan University and was going to Japan to study.</p>
<p>"Sunrise" was performed for a total of three days and was greatly welcomed by the Japanese. Miss Feng's photo was printed in almost every newspaper.</p>
<p>I went to see it on the second night and happened to meet Akita Ujaku, who was also watching it for the second time. He said to me very sincerely:</p>
<p>"The Chinese are indeed geniuses. A play of such a grand scale as 'Sunrise' is rarely seen in Japan, especially with an actress like Miss Feng, whom Japan has never produced."</p>
<p>I said to him, "Miss Feng is still a student."</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied immediately, "I talked with her for a long time last night, so the Chinese are indeed geniuses."</p>
<p>His white hair rippled with his sincerity.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. I returned to Shanghai at the end of July and have been there for nearly two years. I have seen "Wu Zetian" in Shanghai, "The Death of Li Xiucheng" in Hankou, and "Long Live China," "Phoenix City," "National Glory," and "Battle" in Chongqing. I feel that these plays are even more advanced than "Sunrise," and the actors' skills have improved rapidly.</p>
<p>Every time I watch a modern drama, I always recall the conscientious old writer from Japan, and even more, I recall his sincere words to me.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I crossed the river and saw the rehearsals for "One Year" by my friends at the dormitory of the Central Photography Studio. Seeing the tireless efforts of my friends, the moving nature of their actions and voices, I couldn't help but think of Akita Ujaku and his words again: "The Chinese are indeed geniuses."</p>
<p>People like Akita Ujaku, who can see the merits of the Chinese as if they were their own, are extremely rare among the Japanese. Let me take Miss Feng Hezi as another example.</p>
<p>Miss Feng originally planned to study in Japan and pursue further education, but she couldn't bear the persecution of the Japanese and finally ran back before the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. She herself had complained to me many times that soldiers and military police were always bothering her there, always disbelieving that she was a student, always saying that she was a professional actress, and even suspecting her of being a female spy using acting as a smokescreen. When she went to Atami for hot springs, even going to the toilet and entering the bath were followed. Therefore, she really couldn't bear it and gave up the idea of studying abroad.</p>
<p>I consider this as—as "giving an example" to prove that we Chinese are indeed geniuses, while the Japanese who generally harbor ill intentions towards China are jealous of us and do their best to hinder our development.</p>
<p>But we must not be discouraged in the slightest, nor should we be complacent. We Chinese are not only geniuses in acting but are also endowed with genius in every aspect. With genius, we must strive to develop it. Having genius but being unwilling to work hard is exactly what the malicious Japanese are secretly hoping and praying for.</p>
<p>Friends, let us all make a resolution and work hard diligently. We must provide various achievements to contribute to human culture, so that people all over the world will say with sincere conviction:</p>
<p>"The Chinese are indeed geniuses!"</p>
<h3>The Opening Act of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Fei Mu</p>
<p>Romain Rolland wrote "July 14th" for the French Revolution; we Chinese have "Huanghuagang."</p>
<p>No country's revolution, like China's, after overthrowing the autocratic court, established a republic, liberating China from the rule of the fewest nobles among ethnic minorities; at the same time, it is carrying out thorough reforms in various aspects of society and culture. Guiding China onto the path of building a modern nation, and evolving to today's vigorous national unity for independence, freedom, equality, and resistance against Japan to build the nation, these twenty years of consistent revolutionary flames.</p>
<p>The fighting spirit and the raging revolutionary flames sprang from the red blood of the seventy-two martyrs of the Xinhai era.</p>
<p>On March 29th of the second year of Xuantong, the first torch of revolution was lit. This torch still illuminates all of China and the entire world.</p>
<p>This illustrates the fighting spirit and irrepressibility of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The Huanghuagang martyrs were only seventy-two in number, but after these seventy-two martyrs, countless unknown heroes sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary struggle of the country and the nation. In today's war of resistance against Japan, this spirit of sacrifice has been carried to the extreme.</p>
<p>In the long span of twenty-eight years, no matter how vicissitudes change, China has always been advancing towards the bright path, and no labor can stop it.</p>
<p>The public performance of "Huanghuagang" contains much of the meaning of expressing the martyrs and commemorating the national revolution; but it cannot be seen merely as a historical drama, because it is still a historical fact of our time, an opening act of a national liberation struggle: (Most of the revolutionary predecessors who participated in the March 29th Uprising are still alive today.) In the psychological time, that is, at the starting point of history, it is as fresh and relevant to reality as national defense dramas such as "Taierzhuang" and "Eight Hundred Heroes."</p>
<p>Grateful to be able to see the performance of "Huanghuagang" at this time, and wishing it success. May 1st, in haste.</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>— Lu Fu</p>
<p>In just a few days of extreme haste, I finally finished editing the fourteen "Huanghuagang" special issues. Although I could barely get two or three hours of sleep each day, and although I was in extreme busyness and fatigue every day, facing these over 700,000 words of work, thinking of this unprecedented lineup, unprecedented unity, and unprecedented service, I was deeply moved and unaware of fatigue.</p>
<h3>Continue</h3>
<p>— Lu Jiao</p>
<p>The organization of a united front for all Hong Kong drama workers has undergone several meetings and discussions. But unfortunately, each gathering has become a waste, and the result is always no follow-up and dispersal!</p>
<p>This time, thanks to the call of a day with great historical significance and the sincere cooperation of comrades, this unprecedented feat was indeed accomplished. This is worthy of joy and celebration!</p>
<p>This pioneering initiative is indeed unprecedented and has its significant meaning, but it is only a large-scale joint performance. The entire unified organization has not yet been established. This is not only an imperfection but also a major regret!</p>
<p>If we frankly and without concealment review the working process of this joint performance, we cannot help but feel the disorganization, the lack of close contact between the various departments, which affects the slowness of work development. This is because there is no sound unified organization.</p>
<p>Especially at present, the drama movement in Hong Kong is developing vigorously, and the organization of drama troupes is constantly increasing. This is certainly a gratifying phenomenon. However, on the other hand, several larger professional drama troupes are struggling in extreme hardship due to the limitations of theaters and other objective conditions. From this situation, we can see that drama in Hong Kong has not yet achieved a stable social position and has not gained a wide audience. These are always serious problems for the future of drama, and these problems cannot be solved by one or two groups fighting alone, because this is the problem of the entire drama industry, which must be solved by the joint efforts of all workers. Then, for the future of the drama movement that is rising and developing, for establishing the status of drama in society, especially for the decision of the road ahead... a unified organization is indeed necessary and urgently needed!</p>
<p>Although this joint performance has its shortcomings in organization, it is because all the workers have a clear understanding of the meaning of this work and hold the same purpose, so in the process of working, they are still very affectionate, close, and harmonious, which is the most pleasing thing.</p>
<p>However, today is the performance, and in two days, the work will be finished. Then this temporary organization will end and disintegrate, and from now on, the harmonious and affectionate emotions of the past ten days or so will also be lost and can never be regained. This is a very regrettable thing!</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that this joint performance will not stop at the first joint performance, but hope to continue to maintain the spirit of unity this time, and immediately establish a sound and permanent unified organization. I firmly believe that all the workers who participated in this joint performance will have this requirement!</p>
<p>The final victory of the War of Resistance will surely belong to us, and similarly, the future of drama will also be bright!</p>
<h3>The Story of the National Revolutionary Historical Drama "Huanghuagang"</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>The great revolutionary historical fact of Huanghuagang has been inscribed for eternity. What is written in the play is only a "dramatic" part, the poetic truth.</p>
<p>Premier Sun, from the year of Yiyou when China was defeated in the Sino-French War, resolved to overthrow the Qing court and create a republic! After the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, there was the Guangzhou Uprising of Dingwei, and after the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing in Gengzi, there was the Huizhou Uprising of the same year; the background is self-evident. After that, there were the Pingli Uprising, the Huanghuagang Uprising, the Huizhou Uprising of Yiwei, the Qinlian Uprising, the Zhennanguan Uprising, the Hekou Uprising when the chieftain's war slave mother and son died, the Anqing Uprising, the Guangzhou Uprising, and the Gengxu Guangzhou New Army Uprising, all of which had the background of the Three Principles of the People, that is, stimulating the vigorous advancement of the Three Principles of the People. All party members adhered to this principle, preceding and succeeding each other without the slightest discouragement. The Russo-Japanese Entente was formed, and thus there was the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29th. The Huanghuagang martyrs' willingness to die as if returning home was all under the influence of this principle, without any difference. However, it was carried out by party members from one or part of one province. After that, it was carried out by party members from home and abroad. Moreover, the elites of the party sacrificed purely for the principle, which was even more shocking to the country, making the people unanimously support the revolution. Before a year passed, the Republic of China was declared. Therefore, this battle can be said to be the Huanghuagang martyrs sacrificing for the Three Principles of the People, that is, using the spirit of sacrifice of the Huanghuagang martyrs to spread the Three Principles of the People among the people, and the Republic of China was able to be created. On March 10th of the Xinhai year, on the day when the flying boat was demonstrated in Wuhan, Wen Shengcai, who had returned from Nanyang, was preparing to assassinate Governor Li Zhun.</p>
<p>Wen Shengcai: Lao Huang, what exactly is going on?</p>
<p>Huang Xiayi: Last night, the headquarters held an emergency meeting and decided to postpone the launch.</p>
<p>Wen Shengcai: Postpone? Today is already March 10th, when is it postponed to?</p>
<p>Huang Xia: March 28th.</p>
<p>Wen Shengcai: So late.</p>
<p>Wen Shengcai, filled with righteous indignation but lacking training, couldn't wait any longer. After the flying boat exercise was over, he saw a sedan chair of a high-ranking official coming and, thinking it was Li Zhun, rushed up and fired several shots. The person in the sedan chair was dead, and he was captured when he ran out of bullets.</p>
<p>Sedan carrier B: (To the commander) Reporting to the lord, Lord Fu has passed away.</p>
<p>Wen Shengcai: What, Lord Fu?</p>
<p>Defense Army: Haven't you heard of General Fuqi?</p>
<p>Wen Shengcai: What? Wasn't the person sitting in the sedan chair Li Zhun? ... Haha, Li Zhun, Li Zhun, consider yourself lucky. Poor Fuqi, you became Li Zhun's scapegoat; haha... Well, although it was the wrong person, killing one more traitor and one more Han slave will rid China of one less pest (Prologue)</p>
<p>Wen Shengcai sacrificed himself. At 8:00 a.m. on March 25th, in the secret agency at No. 8 Ganjiaxiang, Yu Peilun was making bombs, and the female comrades were working enthusiastically together. Some revolutionary comrades were waiting for Huang Keqiang's arrival. There were eight agencies in Xiguan—twelve in the eastern district. Eight in Henan. It is already has more than seventy guns, but the pioneers are eight hundred people. The large amount of military equipment transported from Japan and Annam will arrive on the 27th, they are going smoothly—at the same time, Comrade Yin Xuzonghan came to report that the governor's office ordered a house-to-house search of the entire city within five days, and the New Army will be transferred away at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>When the Manchu police came to search, the female comrades all pretended to be Comrade Yin's family members. They got away with it! It was only because a list was in Chen Jingbo's hand that it almost caused the entire group to be wiped out.</p>
<p>Just as the crisis passed, someone knocked on the door. It turned out to be Lin Juemin's wife, who had come from afar to find him. For the sake of revolution, for the sake of work, he could not see his passionate and deeply affectionate wife. He could only avoid her, letting Peilun and Zhuo Yanxing fob her off.</p>
<p>Huang Keqiang came and gave everyone hope and courage. In the debate over whether to start the uprising sooner or later, he said, "In all things, when it is time to do something, there must be a great determination, that is, either succeed or perish," then there will be a harvest. If we postpone it again today, it would be equal to disbanding ourselves. How can we face the Premier in the future, how can we face our compatriots overseas? If everyone does not have the determination, I am willing to fight Li Zhun alone to apologize to my comrades." So everyone decided to start the uprising on the 28th (First Act)</p>
<p>In another camp, late at night on March 27th, in Zhang Mingqi's foreign-style flower hall, maids and male servants were flirting. Zhang Mingqi returned with his advisor Huang Guocai. Another scene reported that revolutionary party members smuggling military equipment had been arrested. He was wondering why the revolutionary party members could not be completely captured and killed, but the second madam came out and disagreed, for the sake of the adults taking care of their health. At this time, Admiral Li came to see him, explaining the serious situation and discussing the strategies to deal with it, "While the New Army is definitely investigating, send people to inspect the barracks in the name of inspection. When they go, they can take down the grips of the guns in the barracks one by one, and also order a house-to-house search throughout the city, strictly guarding against insurgents."</p>
<p>A traitor came to inform them. They learned of the news of the uprising on the 28th. Zhang Mingqi was so scared that his legs went weak. Li Zhun decided to transfer Wu Zongyu's patrol battalion back to consolidate the provincial capital, stationing two battalions to guard the Longwangmiao Heights, and the rest guarding the ships along the Jinghaimen River (Second Act)</p>
<p>Turmoil and tension.</p>
<p>At about 7 p.m. on the 28th, in another revolutionary agency, many male and female comrades were transporting military equipment. Lin Wen, Lin Yinming, Lin Juemin, Yu Zenglun, Zheng Kun, and Song Yulin mentioned the matter of the New Army being disarmed on the evening of the 29th.</p>
<p>Lin Juemin: That's right, victory will definitely be ours even if we ourselves are sacrificed. - In order to achieve victory, our sacrifice is necessary. As long as we have the determination to sacrifice, even if we fail this time, the impact on the general public will be indelible!!</p>
<p>Zheng Kun: Whoever is afraid of sacrifice is not worthy of being a revolutionary.</p>
<p>Huang Keqiang arrived and said that he had received a telegram from Hong Kong to start the uprising on the 30th. He had already replied that it was too late to change, and it was still set for the 29th. However, Hu Yisheng reported that the military equipment transported by a group of female comrades was seized. Chen Jiongming also came to report the news that two battalions of patrol troops had been transferred and three sentries were sent to guard the Longwangmiao Heights. Everyone asked to postpone it, and Huang Keqiang also agreed with anger and pain.</p>
<p>Xu Zonghan and Yu Peilun rushed over, and Li Wenfu and Lin Juemin were all in favor of starting the uprising as scheduled.</p>
<p>Huang Keqiang: Okay, then we will decide like this. Concentrate our strength and attack the governor's office tomorrow. We want to complete this glorious page in history.</p>
<p>Yu Peilun: The opportunity has reached the final moment. If we don't succeed, we will perish. We are all determined to die. There is no room for consideration now.</p>
<p>Huang Keqiang: That's right, if we don't succeed, we will perish. In order to achieve national liberation, in order to strive for the realization of the Three Principles of the People, we cannot hesitate in the slightest. We will not hesitate to sacrifice everything. We will use our blood, our flesh, and our heads to build a glorious monument.</p>
<p>At 5:30 p.m. on March 29th, while Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun were interrogating revolutionary party members Chen Meixin and Rao Guoying in the Governor-General's Office, the revolutionary party members attacked. Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun fled in panic.</p>
<p>Because of insufficient strength, many revolutionary party members were killed or injured. Huang Keqiang, Zhu Zhixin, and others were urged by their comrades to leave. Li Wenfu and others were arrested when they ran out of bullets. The seventy-two martyrs sacrificed heroically.</p>
<p>On October 10th of the same year, the Wuchang Uprising was successful and the Republic of China was established. (Fourth Act)</p>
<p>On March 29th of the twenty-eighth year, our overseas compatriots held a memorial meeting for the Huanghuagang Uprising. "Dear compatriots, comrades, after twenty-two months of the national self-defense war, we have progressed to a more serious new stage! To accelerate the victory of the War of Resistance, we must do our best to thoroughly complete the mission entrusted to us by the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and the Premier! A new China is about to be reborn. The spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs will never die! Long live the Chinese nation! Long live the Chinese nation!" (Epilogue)</p>

<h3>English Middle School Inter-School Sports Meet: La Salle Wins the Overall Championship, Diocesan Boys' School Wins the Second Place, Central British School Wins the Third Place; Guo Tongxiong Breaks Old Record in Pole Vault</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong English Middle School Inter-School Sports Meet held its finals at the South China Athletic Association Stadium at Caroline Hill yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. A total of nine schools participated: Queen's College, King's College, Central British School, Diocesan Boys' School, St. Joseph's College, St. Stephen's College, Wah Yan College, La Salle College, and St. Paul's College. There were more than a hundred athletes participating, and the competition was fierce. Among the eleven events, there was one new record and one tied record. The results were slightly worse than in previous years. The reason is the impact of the loose track after heavy rain. Guo Zhixiong of St. Stephen's College has extraordinary strength and correct posture, and was able to break last year's record of one foot ten and a half inches held by Hong Huidong of St. Joseph's College in the pole vault event with nine feet eleven and a half inches. If he works hard, the results will definitely be more than this. He is a promising talent. The athletes of La Salle College bravely crowned the entire stadium, winning a total of 30 points, and winning the Governor's Shield and the Paul Chater Cup. Diocesan Boys' School ranked second with 23 and a half points. Central British School ranked third with 15 points. After the competition, the Secretary of Education distributed seven awards, and they dispersed with cheers. The complete results are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Britain Actively Seeking to Host Next World Games; International Olympic Committee to Meet in June to Carefully Select Representatives and Vie for Hosting Rights</h3>
<p>[London Correspondence] The British Olympic Committee has recently been actively seeking to host the 1944 World Games in London. It is reported that they are quite confident of securing the right to host the next World Games.</p>
<p>The British side has been preparing extensively for the selection of personnel to attend the International Olympic Committee meeting, which opens on June 6, to ensure that the representatives are appropriate and that it is advantageous to secure a vote for the location of the next World Games during the meeting.</p>
<p>The International Committee will be held at St. James's Palace in London. King George was originally scheduled to hold the opening ceremony, but due to his tour of Canada, the Duke of Gloucester will represent him instead. The British side has planned a number of activities involving the royal family and social circles. Therefore, it is predicted that cities such as Detroit in the United States, Switzerland, Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, or Rome will not be able to compete with London.</p>
<p>For the 13th Winter Olympic Games, Oslo in Norway and Montreal in Canada are both hopeful. Oslo could have obtained the 1940 Winter Olympic Games, but the World Ski Championships were also held in Oslo at the same time, so it had to concede to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Recently, the Mayor of London has officially written to the International Committee requesting to host the next Games and guaranteeing all funds. The British Olympic Committee also pointed out that London has not yet officially received the right to host the Olympic Games, even when it was held in London in 1906, it was only taken over by London because Rome suddenly gave up.</p>
<h3>Macau Inter-Port Football Team to Challenge Eastern in Hong Kong; Date Set for This Sunday Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the Eastern Athletic Association football team defeated the Navy team 3-2 last Saturday to win the runner-up position in this year's First Division League, its reputation has spread far and wide. It is said that the Macau Football Association sent a letter yesterday proposing to send the inter-port team to Hong Kong to play an exhibition match with the Eastern team. It is reported that the Eastern Association has accepted the invitation and has scheduled the match for 4:30 pm this Sunday afternoon at the Hong Kong Football Club ground. The selected players for both sides will be announced later.</p>
<h3>Belilios Public School Held Sports Day Yesterday; Guangdong Team Wins Championship Among Provincial Teams</h3>
<p>Belilios Public School in Hong Kong held its first sports day yesterday at the Hong Kong University sports ground. Many guests from all walks of life attended, and the atmosphere was very lively. The competition started at 8:30 am and ended at around 12:00 pm. The Guangdong team won the championship among the provincial teams. The results of all the competition events were very satisfactory. Finally, Mrs. Li Shu-fen presented the awards, and everyone dispersed in joy.</p>
<h3>Hsu and Tsai Win in British Hard Court Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bournemouth, 1st] In the first week of the British Hard Court Tennis Championships, Hsu Cheng-chi, the Chinese Davis Cup player and former champion, defeated Romanian player Han Bajak 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. Tsai Hui-chuan also defeated Mr. Milford 6-1, 6-0, 6-3.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Men's Basketball: Eastern vs. Star Island; Even Strength Makes a Fierce Battle Inevitable; Second Division: Chun Cao vs. Taikoo, Pui Ying vs. South China</h3>
<p>Three public men's basketball games will be held tonight (3rd) at the YMCA gymnasium. The first game, Second Division, is at 6:30 pm, Chun Cao vs. Taikoo; the second game, First Division, is at 7:30 pm, Eastern vs. Star Island; the third game is at 8:30 pm, Pui Ying vs. South China. Eastern is a strong team in this year's competition, with exceptional strength. It has many talented players, such as Feng Nianhua's breakthroughs under the basket, Sun Baoqing and Chen Zongqi's interceptions and long shots, which are unique skills. Huang Dingfen is also capable of both long-range and close-range attacks. Zhong Guoneng and Luo Jilian are able to coordinate well. In addition, Xu Hengnan has returned from his expedition, reorganized his team, and his momentum is even more exuberant. However, Star Island also has strong players. In an exhibition match, they once defeated Eastern, which shows their strength. Moreover, their combat experience is particularly good at detours and breakthroughs, and they utilize a man-to-man strategy. Zai Luncheng, Liang Guoduo, and Li Peiyan are all able to overcome obstacles and defeat generals. Xin Yalang and Lu Zhenxuan are also able to shoot accurately. Li Shichi and Pan Yaojun's sneak attacks under the basket always achieve success. The meeting of the two armies today will inevitably lead to a fierce battle. As for who will win, it is difficult to predict. In the Second Division game, Chun Cao vs. Taikoo, although Chun Cao is not a strong team, their fighting spirit is quite admirable. Taikoo is slightly weaker, and victory may not be easy to obtain. In the Pui Ying vs. South China game, Pui Ying's fighting power is quite strong. Since their debut, they have been invincible. South China is also a strong army in this year's competition and has been defeated once, but its strength has not disappeared. The two armies will hold each other tonight, and there will be a fierce battle, but Pui Ying's offense and defense are consistent, and they have a chance to win.</p>
<h3>Youth Association Organizes Elementary Basketball Training Class; Starts on the 11th of This Month</h3>

<h3>Jianquan Cup Match: Amateur vs. Wah Hung Rescheduled</h3>
<p>The Jianquan Lin Table Tennis Competition, the preliminary round ended successfully last week, leaving a good impression in the minds of people from all walks of life. It is found that the skills of the players are becoming more and more sophisticated and in line with science. For example, the rackets are changed to the rubber boards used by the champions, which are also very proficient. There is a tendency to improve by leaps and bounds. It is found that there is still one game left in the competition. Because the Amateur and Wah Hung teams of the 918 group have both lost three games, and the points are equal, the two teams will have another final to determine who will win the final. The association originally scheduled the final for tonight, but the Amateur team happened to coincide with the Three Banks Cup on Sunday, and the tournament must be held on time and they cannot be in two places at once, so they requested a change. Wah Hung has agreed. The association has approved their request and has now finalized the final to be held at its holy meeting at 7:30 pm on the 5th of this month. The two teams have their own experts, and who will win or lose is impossible to judge. The public will draw lots to form groups at the school's ballroom at 8:30 pm that evening.</p>

<h3>Without Violation</h3>
<p>— Ya Lu</p>
<p>Not violating the Three Principles of the People, not violating government laws and decrees, not violating the interests of the nation and the people. These are the opening three of the twelve national covenants in the Outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization. Anyone who holds the meaning of the National Spiritual Mobilization will certainly not ignore these three issues.</p>
<p>For conditions that are beneficial to the country and the people, there are no violating actions, which can be considered a good citizen. However, Weger said that only reaching the level of non-violation seems insufficient during this period of resistance. We must go further to earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People, government laws and decrees, and things that increase the interests of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>However, if we want to implement these three tasks, we must have a deep understanding of them. First, we must know that the Three Principles of the People is the doctrine of national salvation, because its goal is to seek national liberation, second is to seek the freedom of civil rights, and third is to seek the equality of people's livelihood. At present, the most important work in China is the war of resistance for national liberation. Once the nation is liberated, the freedom of rights and the equality of people's livelihood can be easily solved. However, if we want to implement the Three Principles of the People, we must recognize the status of our country, enhance our national consciousness, and have a spirit of loyalty to the country, loyalty to the cause, and loyalty to the people, and contribute our talents and money as much as possible to the struggle for national liberation.</p>
<p>The second point concerns the government's laws and decrees, which not only must not be violated but must also be implemented to the best of our ability. The National Spiritual Mobilization Law is the most urgently needed to be implemented at this stage. Chairman Chiang has already said: "After the war of resistance entered the second phase, the enemy was already in a military dilemma, becoming more and more embarrassed and more and more bewildered day by day; recently, the enemy has focused on political manipulation, fabricating facts, and alienating the people, in order to subdue our spirit first, decompose our spirit, and then conquer our entire nation..." Therefore, with this National Spiritual Mobilization Law, it should be enough to inspire the people's ambition, increase the people's understanding of the country, strengthen the people's belief in victory, and invigorate the people's spirit of resistance, so that the enemy's political conspiracies, shaking and anesthetizing methods cannot be used.</p>
<p>The third point is to implement the issue of enhancing the interests of the country and the nation. Placing personal interests above the interests of the country and the people is really a selfish concept. The ancients said: "If the skin is not there, what will the hair attach to?" This means that the people and the country have a relationship of interdependence. If the country is destroyed and cannot survive, the people will not be able to enjoy the benefits of living and working in peace, and will be treated as slaves. Therefore, the interests of the country should be regarded as higher than everything else. China is now fighting for survival in the war of resistance. We should concentrate our efforts on doing all work that is beneficial to the country. Because after the country is restored, the people will enjoy endless benefits.</p>
<p>The war of resistance will surely be won, and the founding of the nation will surely be achieved. We must earnestly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, not only without violation.</p>
<h3>Many Roads</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>When sailing in the winding Qujiang River, with many islands and turns, or on an ancient road without carriages, with many crisscrossing ruts, a traveler is often saddened by the many roads due to not being able to distinguish east from west.</p>
<p>It is not a straight and smooth road, without road signs, without maps, without anyone to guide you, and the sky is very gloomy, and a mountain rain is about to come, with dark clouds filling the sky. You cannot climb high and look far, nor can you observe the details. You will have no intention of being calm and composed, standing alone on the crossroads. The livestock are tired, and people are hungry and thirsty. Lest you are robbed by bandits, lest you entrust yourself to wolves and tigers, you should take a break and find your lodging for tonight. Therefore, you have to choose the road you should take from several crossroads.</p>
<p>Everyone has their future, and everyone has a "break" point. The livestock are tired, and people are hungry and thirsty, and dusk is approaching, so you cannot stand still at the crossroads or sleep in the wilderness. Therefore, travelers each support with poles and oars, feed the horses and grease the carts, each climbing the hillside, crossing the plain, rushing to the shoal, surrounding the harbor, and each encountering adverse currents and favorable winds, difficulties and smoothness, dark roads and sheep intestines, life, death, misfortune, and happiness.</p>
<p>The road is unpredictable. It is difficult to predict your comfort and hardship based on the flatness and danger in front of you. A smart and upright traveler must not forget his future for the sake of temporary comfort.</p>
<p>The many roads also determine the fate of many paths. Often a happy road is buried in thorns, and an evil road is full of pulp. Friends, how will you choose your path?</p>
<p>Will you drink that pulp? Or will you let the thorns pierce your feet? There is no happy road from the beginning, no unsweet olive, no eternally peaceful life. Life, a reverse journey of heaven and earth, isn't it also a variable crossroads? The torment of poverty, the whip of power, the sweet enticement of profit, often make you lose your own opinion. You cannot calm down and take care of your honor and disgrace, your life and afterlife, your ancestors and descendants. Therefore, you enjoy the sweet pulp and abandon the thorns.</p>
<p>The sadness and happiness in front of you are all illusory. Short-sighted people cannot see through the illusion, so they each experience the current sadness and joy.</p>
<p>Sadness and joy are often impermanent. The current success is inevitably the future frustration. A smooth road to success is to fall into a mud pit; greedily drinking pulp is to kill yourself with poison; people who are full of confidence in sleeping safely at night are also buried in wolves and tigers, with a stupid smile still remaining on their lips. Greed and temporary comfort have been exchanged for cruelty and misery.</p>
<p>Changes happen in an instant, is there any change less than that of many roads? Happiness, misery, darkness, light, righteousness, evil, crisscrossing, all placed in front of you, allowing you to choose. Each road has its own destiny. The road is many-forked, and the fate is also many-forked. Let you choose. You can take disaster because of this, or you can gain blessing because of this, you can also leave regrets for thousands of years, or you can leave a good name for generations.</p>
<p>Perhaps you clearly know that you are heading for your future, but you are afraid of taking the thorny road ahead. People are tired, hungry, the road is long, the body is cold, there is nothing to wear and eat, there is nothing to play with, you can't help but be powerless, and you can't help but be tired. Naturally, you can't help but steel your heart and say fiercely, let's do it recklessly, so you embark on the evil road, you say it is for life.</p>
<p>That's right, everyone has to live. Stepping on the evil road, you are living now. Not only living, but also being able to indulge in evil, you are proud of the present, but have you ever looked at that distant, Soshan and the other side? Can you point out to me the joy beyond those few arrows, the final ending?</p>
<p>You are delighted with color, can I not be saddened?</p>
<p>So I shudder, open my eyes, and focus on the high places and the distant forces: I recognize the confused roads. Finally, I find that there are only two: the present suffering and the present joy.</p>
<p>I look for a mountain peak again and see higher and further, and what I see is still two: eternal suffering and eternal joy. The current suffering and joy are not the same as eternity, but are opposite.</p>
<p>The many roads also determine the fate of many roads. Choose, you and I should be on the road.</p>
<p>The mountain rain is about to come, and dark clouds fill the sky. Dusk is approaching again. Isn't it when you are hungry, tired, and swaying?</p>
<p>Many roads, difficult to identify in the vastness, you must be cautious about where you go.</p>
<h3>Package</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>Knowing that the Propaganda Team Leader wants to invite him to go on patrol outside the city in the first month, Zhou knows that he is very unwilling. Then, he takes a bowl of white fungus soup, and keeps stirring it with a wooden silver spoon, staring blankly at the white, hot air in a daze. Aunt Wang leaned against the door, watching with interest. She reached out and turned off the light switch with a "pat", and the room immediately went dark. Zhou was startled, pushed the bowl to the table, stood up and wanted to hide. Suddenly, he heard a series of delicate laughter, and then he knew it was Aunt Wang. Then the lights came on again, and he sat down again. Aunt Wang fluttered over, dressed in flowery clothes. Zhou picked up the bowl again, and said, both angrily and affectionately:</p>
<p>"These kinds of jokes can't be made. The police chief was just assassinated, and my life is hanging in the balance. Don't you just know how to mess around..."</p>
<p>"Don't say that. Who told you to take this smelly job!" Aunt Wang leaned over, opened her mouth, her pink face was white and red, and then asked: "Is it sweet enough?"</p>
<p>Zhou handed over a spoonful tremblingly, and sent it to Aunt Wang's mouth. Zhang Ma lightly called from outside the door: "Master."</p>
<p>Zhou pushed away Aunt Wang in a hurry, put down the bowl, and asked solemnly:</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>Zhang Ma solemnly held a paper package, walked to the side of the table, and handed it to Zhou with both hands. Aunt Wang took it, but immediately put it on the table, and said with a sharp mouth:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's so heavy!"</p>
<p>Zhou inspected the package while listening to Zhang Ma.</p>
<p>"The doorman sent it in, saying it was sent by a young man. When he asked him if he wanted a receipt, he said no, no, turned around and left."</p>
<p>A young man, not wanting a receipt, with no words on the package, and so heavy. He shook his head carefully to understand the rope, but the rope was tied so tightly that he couldn't untie it for a while. Aunt Wang was impatient, and rushed over to tear it, heavy-handed and heavy-footed. Zhou became anxious and quickly held Aunt Wang's hand:</p>
<p>"Gently, gently, be careful it's a bomb."</p>
<p>When Aunt Wang heard this, she was so frightened that she withdrew her hand and rushed over to hug Zhou, her pink face changed color, writing to Zhang Ma:</p>
<p>"Why didn't you ask clearly where it was sent from? What's inside? You just held it in so confused..."</p>
<p>Zhou frowned, stretched out his finger and wanted to untie the knot, and kept saying:</p>
<p>"Don't make noise, don't make noise, what's that! If it's not a bomb, won't people laugh to death! If it spreads to the team, they will have more to ridicule. The fight room is also absurd, why didn't you ask clearly?"</p>
<p>Aunt Wang blocked him with both hands, not allowing him to move, and the two of them wrestled into a ball.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the telephone on the wall rang. Zhang Ma went up to answer it, raised the microphone high and called:</p>
<p>"Master, it's a call from Counselor Zhao from Zhao's residence."</p>
<p>Aunt Wang jumped up, let go of Zhou, rushed over, took the microphone, pressed it to her ear, and said while panting:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you, yes, it's me... Who sent it? What?... Da Ting's braised beef?... Okay, okay, I received it, but I haven't opened it yet. Why didn't you bring it yourself?... Oh! Okay, is Master there? He's asleep..."</p>
<p>Zhou rushed in, and she had already hung up the microphone, and patted Zhou's shoulder while laughing, and said:</p>
<p>"Xiao Zhao came from Beijing and brought Da Ting's braised beef. He asked his nanny to send it to his son. That child is inexperienced, so he put it down and left without asking for a receipt. He was worried, so he called to ask."</p>
<p>Zhou breathed a sigh of relief, and Zhang Ma understood. She took the white fungus soup bowl and quietly withdrew.</p>
<h3>Burial</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>A vast curtain of night was pulled from the edge of the sky, obscuring the entire wilderness. The firmament was like a black, boundless sea, without a single star, not even a sliver of moon, all submerged in the depths. Cold, desolate, and silent, only the chill of the night stirred.</p>
<p>This place had once been a fertile field, exuding fragrance. Golden rice ears swayed in waves of abundance. Mornings and evenings, wisps of blue smoke rose from the thatched roofs, slowly blending into the milky white morning mist and crimson twilight. Gurgling streams meandered around the dwellings, a tranquil, peaceful village.</p>
<p>Now, lying silently are crumbling walls and broken tiles. The rugged earth emanates a musty, rotten smell, tinged with the stench of blood. Even the sound of the wind seems to wail. The world is buried under the heavy weight of death.</p>
<p>A group of dark figures slowly moved toward this place, like a small snake, stubbornly crawling, finally coming to a halt. Resting by a small stream, there were about thirty or so men. Carrying assorted rifles, Arisakas, Mausers, and various other weapons, they wore different kinds of clothing: military uniforms and short jackets. They had different faces: square ones, round ones. However, their hearts were not "each as their face." Belief and will had forged the brothers into a single piece of steel. Struggle was the anvil, tempering them to be purer and stronger.</p>
<p>"He's dead," the two comrades at the rear of the group placed down a crude stretcher, touched the wounded man, and uttered these two simple words. Their tone was somber and low, flowing through the night sky. The news twisted everyone's faces, causing spasms of grief. Pain lodged in the hearts of all the men, like crows perched on a tower in the setting sun, but not a dazzling sunset, rather a desolate, deep night. Suddenly, the black door of death opened, snatching away another tenacious soul, one who had been playing with death all day.</p>
<p>Silence enveloped the group, no one spoke. Three comrades silently dug a pit, shoveling away the earth, as if scraping away at their own hearts.</p>
<p>The biting night wind caressed their faces, like playful, unknown insects, making them drowsy. But these men remained still as bizarre rocks. Excessive grief had numbed their senses.</p>
<p>Under the solemn gaze of more than a dozen pairs of eyes, the martyred warrior returned to the earth. He was buried. Resentment burned in the hearts of the living. Sparks of revenge burst forth in their minds.</p>
<p>"Today, in a battle, a comrade sacrificed himself. The death of a partner certainly makes us sad, but sacrifice is inevitable. We must have the courage to face death. Freedom and liberation must be exchanged for blood. For the eternal survival of the nation, we will not begrudge individual lives. Comrade ×'s death is glorious, great," the captain suppressed his own emotions, saying each word forcefully and resolutely. "We should commemorate the fallen comrade with a more tenacious and sustained struggle!"</p>
<p>A white dove fluttered its wings in his heart, wanting to fly out of his chest. The final sentence stirred the dove's wings, tempting it to fly.</p>
<p>In the deep night scene, the figures moved forward again, finally disappearing into the endless darkness.</p>
<p>From the distant sky, the sharp sound of gunfire cut through the long night's silence.</p>
<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>In order to interrupt her notion of buying a newspaper, he had no choice but to respond to her friendly teasing with friendly jest.</p>
<p>"Am I some kind of 'Miss' that I can act high and mighty?"</p>
<p>"Who are you kidding, who's a 'Miss'? You can't not tell me today!"</p>
<p>She erupted with childishness; this childishness was a deliberate attempt to be endearing. In front of her, he also deliberately pretended to be a child, saying:</p>
<p>"I just won't tell you today, I want to see what you can do to me!"</p>
<p>"I'll do whatever I want to you, you don't believe me, just try me!"</p>
<p>"You dare!"</p>
<p>"See if I dare, I must make you afraid of me this time!"</p>
<p>"Me afraid of you? Hmph, I'm afraid you'll cry!"</p>
<p>"Damn you, will you say it or not? Who are you calling 'Miss'?"</p>
<p>"You, you!"</p>
<p>"I'm not, I'm not, not a hundred times!"</p>
<p>"You're not? Then you just ask people to buy a newspaper for you so casually!"</p>
<p>"Then I'll go out and buy it myself, will you read it?"</p>
<p>He blocked the doorway with his hand, teasing her. She pushed him a couple of times, unable to break through, so she simply punched him and went back. He asked:</p>
<p>"You got your money's worth this time!" (55)</p>
