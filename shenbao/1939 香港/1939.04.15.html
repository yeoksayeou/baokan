<h3 id="c1">英人民對英政府的熱望 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>英國著名經濟家喬治佩斯爵士為明暸世界各地的經濟情形，特地周遊世界，日昨抵港發表一篇談話，含着極其豐富，充分表親着英國人民如何對政府抱着另一種的熱望。他劈頭稱：「前者英國以為苟能以合理的步驟對付獨裁者，則獨裁者當能趨於合理化，但今巳明瞭事實並不如此」。的確的，蠻橫的侵略者絕不是可以理喻的，只有強硬的態度和具體的辦法，可以阻止他們無理的取鬧。『喬治佩斯正確地指出英國政府姑息侵略者造成今日局面的的責任說：『英國民衆的意見，大部分早巳認為應取強硬政策，怯懦者乃政府而非人民』。英國政府過去對侵略者的退讓，致使造成今日歐洲尾大不掉的情形，其責任所在，在這寥寥數言中算巳全部道破。英國人民對於政府期待之如何熱烈，亦可想見。</p>
<p>我們相信英國政府過去對侵略者採取懷柔政策，不是沒有原因，簡單一句話，就是恐懼戰爭爆發，貪圖着沒有根基的和平。其實，愛好和平而對侵略者退讓的結果，正如喬治佩斯所指破的：「每次向獨裁者屈服，卽每次屢趨近于戰爭。本人認為今日戰爭危機已告逼近，苟能早日實施此種步驟——指制裁獨裁者——則戰爭當不如今日之迫近。……英法美蘇今已不再向獨裁者讓步，本人不相信在最近的將來會有戰事發生。」這個道理，我們已屢次著文闡發過，在歐洲危機業已相當深刻的今日，英國府政應當細鈿吟味這幾句話。</p>
<p>現在，世界各國皆已承認「情勢極端嚴重」，歐洲的觀察家皆推測德意兩國或當繼續擴展勢力。意大利已經召集一部分後備兵入伍，陸軍員額已在一百萬名以上。德國方面也已局部動員，過往柏林的軍隊非常的繁忙。意大利且有派遣軍隊在西班牙登陸之說。東歐方面，匈牙利對羅馬尼亞及南斯拉夫準備着進軍，但澤自由市的國社黨也有於短期內宣布該市併入德國的準備，其重大糾紛將更複雜化。聞德國且巳向波蘭提出酷刻要求！（一）將但澤移交德國；（二）予德國在波蘭走廊建築一條公路聯貫德國及東普魯士；（三）割讓希萊西亞東邊及上希萊西亞的波蘭領土；（四）保證其他地方德國少數人民的自治。德軍大隊具巳集中於德波邊境上。這等於威脅波蘭締結城下之盟</p>
<p>東歐諸小國大部分受英國保證，德意威脅諸小國，也卽威脅英國，英國的態度確實値得注意。英國能否採取適當的措置，卽可以斷定德意的蠢動能否暫停。英國現在還在進行對希臘及土耳其保證的談判，想藉以爭取在東歐方面的盟主地位。英國這目的能否達到，就要以它對波蘭的保證能否兌現為斷。英國今日巳處於侵越的地位。一方面，不但東歐諸小國皆爭趨她的保護，法國並且追隨英國表示十分強硬，達拉第的宣言已與張伯倫的宣言同時公佈，表明『各極權國家如再有侵略行為，不論加諸羅馬尼亞，波蘭，希臘，或土耳其者，均將索引英法入於戰爭旋窩之中。』另一方面，美國已漸積極協助蘇聯，以便制止東方侵略者的蠢動，減少其對英法在東方的牽制力量。</p>
<p>在今日的情勢下，英國政府應該順應人民的意志，在歐洲方面積極採取強硬的態度以對付德意兩兇，在遠東方面，除自己積極行動之外，還須進一步帮助中國抗戰，切實與美蘇聯結。今日，英國自由黨領袖，勞合喬治公開斥責張伯倫不應過信獨裁者，並敦促張伯倫從速與蘇聯成立切實的軍事英諒解，英國與美蘇的聯結，要於着重切實與誠意，新加坡鞏固無比的軍港，將來應供給美國等利用，對於蘇　種種的供給應有具體的規定。英法政府刻巳向德意侵略者提出最後的警告，英國人民必定在期待着英國政府能够強硬質澈主張到底罷。</p>
<h3 id="c2">新四軍一年來抗戰的經驗與教訓 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 項英</p>
<p>新四軍抗戰經過</p>
<p>新四軍的成立時間很短，真是在抗戰中產生出來，這是與其他軍隊不同的。可以說本軍的成玄一直到今天，經過了四個階段。</p>
<p>第一階段：改編。我們軍隊的前身是散佈在南方的江西，湖南，福建，廣東，浙江，安徽，湖北等這些省分的紅色游擊隊與紅軍改編而成的。自從七，七，八，一三，事變以來，南方各省的紅軍，及紅色游擊隊為了保衛中華民國，為了爭取中華民族的解放，在民國二十六年十月二日，奉軍事委員會侖令改編為國民革命軍陸軍新編第四軍。實際上我們部隊改編為新四軍是在二十七年一月間開始的，也可以說在二十七年才正式進行正式完成的。雖然我們部隊散佈在南方七八省地區，有很遼遠的範圍，很多的單位，但能在這一命令和中國共產黨決定下面，一致的把部隊改編完成。從二十七年一月到二月中是本軍改編的時期。</p>
<p>第二階段：集中。改編後一月。奉蔣委員長命令新編第四軍分兩地集中，江北向××集中，江南向××集中，二月十日以後，是第二階段的開始，改編了的部隊依着指定地區集中，首先是第一支隊二月十日由各駐地向前開動，接着第二支隊和第三支隊繼續開進，江北也陸續的向××地區集中，我們的軍部是四月十日自南昌向皖南移動，雖然我們極大多數部隊相距有二千多里，而且最大部分是徒步行軍，但終於在四月十日集中完成，集中完畢以後，戰區司令長官派員到××點驗集中部隊。自二月十日至四月十日是第二個階段。</p>
<p>第三階段：部隊的前進與展開。當我們部隊集中完畢的時候，又奉着司令長官的命令，要我們迅速的開進，開到作戰地區進行戰鬥，這四月十五日的命令，我記得在命令上給我們的任務是要我們到指定地區構成游擊網，襲擊敵人，破壞敵人的交通，並在指定的地區構築游擊根據地。</p>
<p>等着我們部隊檢驗完畢，於四月廿八日開始向指定地區與作戰地區前進。這是本軍先遣隊向前開進的日子，這先遣隊是我們在江南部隊抽出一部份組織的，它的任務是要了解與偵察前進的路線與作戰的情况，以便於部隊的開進，先遺隊出發以後，接着主力部隊陸續跟進，隨着先遣隊開入江南作戰地區，同時我們司令部亦於五月間移至南段，指揮全部作戰，由四月二十日起，一直至五月，一方面是開入作戰地區以後，進行作戰，這是本軍抗戰的第三階段。</p>
<p>第四階段：作戰。我們的部隊前進到作戰地區與正式展開以後，便正式作戰。（A）第一，江北部隊到達指定作戰地區之時（五月十六日）正是×人向合肥進攻，企圖在巢湖東岸渡過西岸，在蔣家河口上開始本軍第一次的戰鬥，戰鬥結果把巢湖×人，完全擊潰，他們繳獲了十一支槍，一面日軍旗子，這是本軍在江北第一次作戰的勝利。（B）第二，江南六月十八日在鎭江以南第二次戰鬥，也可說是江南第一次的勝利，這次是截擊由鎭江南下的汽車，除了逃脫一輛以外，全部都被擊燬，並擊斃了日本土井少佐一名，和梅崗武郎大尉二名，繳獲了長短槍十餘枝，以及其他軍用品，還有七千多元日金，這是江南第一次戰鬥的勝利，自從江北五月十六，江南六月十八以後，開始進行戰鬥，由此江南，江北進行了最激烈的戰鬥，這種戰鬥是根據司令長官給我們的務任，由戰鬥達到任務的完成，而這種戰鬥任務，還是游擊戰的任務。一直到九月底，我們又接着司令長官的命令要我們部隊接受靑弋江友軍陣地，十月七日一個支隊到靑弋江沿河一帶，接受陣地，這就是本軍開始担負了局部的陣地戰。在這一階段上說大部份是游擊戰小部份是陣地戰，按照軍隊的火力來講，本軍火力很弱，沒有强有力的火力，是不能够担任陣地戰進行陣地戰的，但為了抗戰的需要，為了便利在同一戰綫上友軍的作戰，不得不勉力接受這個任務，並且完成了這個任務。有人說八路軍新四軍不打陳地戰的，他們是拒絕陣地戰的，講這些話的人，他們是不了解或者誤解，我們可以說我們火力比任何軍隊差，火力弱的軍隊，是不能担任陣地戰，是不能完成陣地戰任務的，但是我們為了抗戰，只要對抗戰有利，雖然在犧牲更大的任務下面，我們是要接受這個任務，並且努力去完成這個務任的。</p>
<p>這是說明本軍抗戰的四個階段，第一個階段改編，第二個階段集中，第三個階段開進與展開，第四個階段作戰。這四個階段是本軍民國二十七年一年的經過。</p>
<p>新四軍作戰經過　概述與作戰成績</p>
<p>本軍作戰經過概述與作戰成續，就是說我們在民國二十七年作戰以及二十七年戰鬥的經過到底怎樣？</p>
<p>第一，我們作戰可以分成兩個階段。以時間說，雖然民國二十七年一個整年，在十二個月中間因為我們要改編，集中，開進與展開，事實上作戰的時間，江北算起來經過只有七個半月，江南講起來只六個半月，在半年多時間，我們作戰的經過，大概可以分為兩個階段</p>
<p>A是我們的進攻，我們積極的進攻，在這個積極進攻的階段中間，又可分為兩個部份：一是江南地區在我們軍隊未進入以前，情形是很紊亂的，尤其是很多紀律很壤的游擊隊，在各地區不僅不能執行抗戰的任務，實行配合全國作戰，並且相反的在這一地區阻碍抗戰的發展，帮助日本帝國主義，便於他們來維持交通，維持統治，所以本軍第一步工作為了能够有力的直接的進攻日本××主義，不得不把我們進攻的障碍除掉，將阻碍民衆抗戰的游擊隊解散或整理，我們開始到這個地區以後，先把朱永祥，陳得功等等游擊司令，江南人稱為小日本的，奉令解除武裝，有的調囘後方加以改編，因為這些障碍的除掉，對於江南作戰有很大的利益，同時因為我們進入作戰地區的時候？由於沒有一個正式的中國軍隊在這地區堅待作戰，反而有些壞的游擊隊，於是竟成了江南偽政權的發展，可以說，除了日本××主義者勢力所不能達到的地方以外，是普遍的建立了偽政權。正因為偽維持會的發展阻碍了江南民衆抗戰局面的展開與廣大民衆抗戰情緒的提高，所以掃除這些維持會，偽政權，是必須的工作，這樣才能使江南民衆由消沉的情緒和障碍下面發動起來，積極來參加抗戰。開展江南的抗戰局面，這是第一階段的第一部份。</p>
<p>第二部份是全面的向日×進攻。隨後當徐州失陷，×人積極向武漢進攻的時候，我們更用最大的努力激烈的戰鬥，在江南戰場來執行保衛武漢的戰鬥，來配合武漢周圍的友軍，以取得保衛武漢任務的完成，這時候的進攻可以分做兩個方面：一方面向着京滬路的兩側，一方面向着京蕪路。這是鐵路方面。在公路上，向着京杭國道以及京滬杭國道間的地區，在江甫自六月十八號起進行了許多的大小戰鬥，如衛崗，竹子　，新豐，下風，新塘，市東，西謝村的戰鬥，南京麒麟門戰鬥，進攻泗涇，進攻句容，進攻江寗車站，這些大小的戰鬥，都是我們在作戰的第一階段向×人採取堅决的進攻開始配合保衛徐州，繼續配合保衛大武漢的戰鬥。自從六月十八日起一直到九月初是我們積極進攻的階段，堅决進攻的階段。</p>
<p>B第二階段是由於我們的進攻使×人不得不採取攻勢的防集。不得不對我們的進攻來一個反攻。從九月十五日以後×人開始向鎭江與丹陽中間地區寶堰分五路進攻，以後×人放棄了宜城漂陽等地，集中兵力向京滬間迂迥，開始了×人向我們進攻。為什麼×人要反攻呢？我們說有三個原因：（一）由於本軍到達江南地區以後，三個月間的積極進攻，使×人的南京，鎭江，感受威脅，南京鎭江是×人在南方作戰的戰略點和樞紐，京滬線是交通的命脈，京滬線京蕪線在我們破壞襲擊下面，×人交通受了極大的阻碍。經常的又有我們的人到南京城內去擾亂，這樣便威脅了日×，他為了除掉這些威脅，不得不向我們反攻。（二）在江南戰區中間，我們所担負的任務，只是游擊區域四分之一，一方面由於我們進攻的積極，一方面由於我四分之三的地區沒有戰鬥或是沒有積極的戰鬥，而我們作戰的四分之一地區，恰恰是×人戰略上，×人兵力轉移上的重要地區，使×人不得不把其他地區的兵力抽調回來，以主力來對付我們，以減輕他的威脅，所以那時宣城，蘇州，無錫等地的日軍，大批的向鎭江，南京，蕪湖開動。</p>
<p>（三）×人進攻武漢主要是靠着海軍，空軍，和陸軍的配合，不是完全靠着陸軍，而是靠着海軍掩護陸軍向武漢進攻，那末，長江一綫是它前進的交通線，所以日寇為了便于接濟前方，輸送、兵力，這樣不得不把長江交通的威脅除去，不得不來一個反攻，這就是說在第二階段由於我們的進攻，使×人進行反攻，原因有這三個。</p>
<p>但是×人這個反攻，是防禦性的反攻，用反攻達到它防禦的目的，想驅逐在京滬線上京杭線上以及在南京周圍所有我們的軍隊，以保障他們的安全。所以進攻不是大規模的，和戰線上的進攻，譬如在皖南的進攻，也是一種防禦的進攻勢，主要的目的是在維持長江交通，因為長江的交通靠船隻，我們以前組織了很多的流動船隻團，使它的運輸不得　暢，使它不得不驅使江南的軍隊來維護它的交通，從整個上來說，×人的反攻，還是防禦的攻勢，這一點我們要分淸楚。</p>
<p>我們從那裏看出×人的進攻呢？從整個江南戰爭的形勢來看，×人現在進攻有三個中心，在皖南以靑陽為中心，在江南一個以茅山為中心，一個以南京與丹陽間的小丹陽為中心，這三個中心，也可說是我軍作戰的據點，與友軍作戰的基點。</p>
<p>在皖南×人從九月到十二月先後佔領貴池，銅陵，繁昌，以致最近進攻靑陽。在江南說，×人九月十日五路進攻寶堰，十二日分三路進攻將野橋，十五日又分兩路進攻，一路進攻上興埠，二路進攻上沛，溧水，十月七日又分兩路進攻，一路進攻新王莊，一路進攻北鎭，放火燒茅山，十月廿四日，五路進攻句容以北地區，十一月十日×又進攻蔣野橋，十一月卅日五路進攻延陵，一直從九月起，×人不斷的進攻我們基點。九月底延陵，黃池，烏溪，靑小鎮十月十二日以後×人分四路進攻小丹陽，十二月十三日進攻霍里，以及最近十二月廿一日進攻朱門，十月十七日×人分兩路進攻紅錫鎭，十一月卅日分三路以猛力來犯骨弋江等地，在皖南以靑陽為中心，在江南以茅山及小丹陽為中心，×人的進攻主要的是想使我們不能在此地立足，使我們被逼離開這個地區，因為這三個地方都是我們戰略的據點，這樣的可以使他們達到威脅的除掉，交通的安全。</p>
<p>總括起來說，在江南從六月十八日起到十二月卅一日止，這一個期間的作戰，可分為兩個階段，第一個階段是我們進攻的時期，第二個階段，則因為我軍的進攻，×人不得不採取防禦的攻勢，造成了×人反攻的形成。</p>
<p>第二，從江南作戰開始，我們總共打了多少次仗呢？總結起來，我們從這六個半月到七個月的期間，江北，江南，總共經過了二百卅四次的戰鬥，在這二百卅四次戰鬥中間，在江甫的戰鬥佔了二百次，可以說我們的戰鬥，主要的是在江南打的。</p>
<p>第三，我們的戰鬥得到了些什麼呢？我想把它作成一個表册，在二百卅四次的戰鬥中，繳獲了一千五百三十九枝步馬槍，卅二挺輕機關槍，四挺重機關槍，四十八枝駁殼槍，二十枝手槍，日本錢大槪有兩萬二千七百卅八圓，文件，大衣，旗子，和其它軍用品是不勝枚舉的（統計表略）除了這些在戰鬥中的繳獲品外，同時擊毀了×人一百九十五輛汽車，破壞了九十五座橋樑，公路，鐵路的破壞另有一個統計。（統計表略）在這六個半月至七個月的期間，×，我傷亡的比例是怎樣的呢。在這期間，我軍共傷亡了六百六十四人，×人傷亡了三千二百卅二人，在×，我對比上觀，是一與四，七之比，也可以說，我們一個人抵它四個半人，這在抗戰中是最合算的了，以過去我們軍隊抗戰來說，在陣地中×我傷亡的比例是我傷亡三，五個×人傷亡一個，在第二第三期才減低為二，五與一之比。游擊戰就正相反，我們死傷一個人，×人就要死傷四個半，積小勝利便成一個大數目，在這六個半月至七個月的經驗中，可以充分看出游擊戰爭在中國抗戰中是對我有利的。</p>
<p>江南戰局變化及其發展趨勢</p>
<p>第一，×情的變動，我們可以從兩方面來講：一是軍事上的變動，一是政治上的變動。</p>
<p>甲，軍事上的變動也可分做兩個階段：第一，六月以前江南戰區的情况。在六月以前，×人軍事是以南京為中心，以蕪湖，鎭江兩個為據點，兩個戰略上的基點兩個戰略上的前進陣地。×人兵力集中在這三個據點上，但是每個據點的兵力並不大，在交通綫上京滬，京蕪，京杭，國道以及交通線兩側的縣城，或大的城鎭，僅駐有少數兵力維持其交通運輸，在六月以前，×人的交通可以暢行無阻，沒有遭受到任何劇烈的打擊和阻碍，×人可以以少數兵力按制一切統治一切，甚至於可以三五成羣的跑到交通線兩側附近的農村中去强姦打刦，很少受到打擊，這就是說：在六月以前×人後方的交通很安全，三條交通的據點，總共兵力不過三個聯隊，從常川，鎭江，南京，當塗一直到蕪湖，只經常的駐有二個多聯隊，其他各據點不過二排人，一班人，正因為後方交通很安全，×人可以抽調大部兵力轉入北戰區，集中准南，津浦一帶，進攻合肥與徐州。這是六月以前的情况，但自本軍進入作戰地區以後，由於我們積極的進攻，不斷的打擊，使×人的交通，遭受經常的停滯，阻碍，感受威脅，×人為了保護軍事的據點，戰略上的樞紐，不得不向我們反攻，在目前來講，×人在兵力上的佈置與以前不同了。第二，目前×人在軍事上的佈置。目前×人兵力散佈集中在兩個地區，一個以南京為中心，一個以蕪湖為基點，×人交通綫，可以說凡是交通要道，譬如在京滬線上，每一座橋樑，車站，公路的轉灣抹角處，都構築據點，都駐有隊伍，一個據點，不消說，卽使小的城市，小的據點，也都集中相當兵力在把守，每一個小地方都經構築工事，作為掩護。我們是在×人據點中間穿來穿去，現在×人的運動或者運輸，都要以兵力來保護，輕易的少數人不敢下鄉了。總計起來在江南的×人，有二個半到三個師　，以蕪湖為中心的有一個師團，南京為中心的有一個師團，鎭江為中心的一個旅團，另外還增加從華北來的，滿洲來的五千多偽軍，×人的佈置更嚴密了，這是×人軍力佈置上大的變動，這是我們來到江南地區的結果。</p>
<p>乙，政治上的動態，×人政治上的動態，也可分為三個時期，第一個時期是六月以前。一，是日本軍隊在江南地區燒，殺，　是普遍的現象，用威力鎮壓中國民衆，使民衆屈服。二，是游擊隊紀律很壤，日本利用這現象來煽動民衆對游擊隊的感情，他們說擾亂和平　，治安的是游擊隊，皇軍是打游擊隊的，用這些事實蠱惑中國民衆曾經收到相當效果。三，是利用兩面派來建立它的統治，兩面派是：日本軍隊來，打鞭砲歡迎，弄些婦女去慰勞皇軍，中國軍隊也打鞭砲，這種兩面派主持了一切，與</p>
<p>互不侵犯，企圖苟安，妥協。四，是游擊隊與日×相互默契，互相不打，過去江南這現象很普遍，現在京，滬東段還存在着。五，如日本利用中國軍隊退出南京以後，沒有軍隊堅留江南作戰，所以宣傳工作沒有，日本可以在中國進行武斷的宣傳，又利用漢奸宣佈</p>
<p>作戰的消息。這使江南民衆抗戰情緒自然消沉。這是日本第一時期的政治行動。</p>
<p>第二時期、本軍進入以後，日本帝國主義大肆活動，一，是到處用飛機散發傳單，說紅軍打土豪是共產黨，企圖造成階級糾紛，使羣衆與我們關係不能聯繫，破壞我們團結，但由于我們軍隊進入此地區以後，用我們的行動，用我們的戰鬥，證明我們軍隊紀律好，是維護人民利益的，使日×的宣傳失却效用。其次是用威力　壓老百姓使之不與我們接近。否則就用大砲亂轟，燒房子，使民衆叫新四軍不要去，免得燒房子，但是後來我們沒有到的地方。仍是一樣的燒一樣的殺，老百姓漸漸感覺到日×的宣傳是欺騙他們的，三，是政治宣傳，×人用反共，反蔣口實，對民衆說你們受戰爭災害是因為共產黨與蔣介石，你們要求得如平，只有反對共產黨反對蔣介石。×人的中心口號是反對中國抗戰的主要力量。這就是說我們軍隊進入以後，他們以前的辦法沒有用了。四，是採取溫柔政策，×人把他們最野蠻的行動也收束　來，施點小惠，使民衆不與我們接近。</p>
<p>第三時期，卽最近動態，一，收服認識不足的，成分不好的，動搖的地方武裝來變叛。二，威脅兩面派站在它那一邊，做它統治的忠實工具。三，利用漢奸到處分化。四，勾結地方動搖分子，不僅與他們通消息，並屬於他的勢力範圍。五，對于積極進攻的軍隊互相默契，採取互不侵犯的態度。六，推行反共運動，如最近在南京，蕪湖開的反共運動大會。七，×人最近利用中國資源使各工廠進行生產，在南京，常州，無錫等地，由日人出面開設工廠，准許那些民族意識薄弱的資本家開工廠，做生意，求日經濟合作，在這些地方正在實行着日貨的傾銷，這樣一方面在開發中國資源，一方面利用中國資源，來進行中日的戰爭，×人在政治上正向這方面進攻，一年來×人在軍事上，政治上有了不同，有了變化。</p>
<p>第二，我們軍事，政治情况變化：（一）六月以前，江南地區偽組織維持會是普遍的存在，中國的政權是很少，很少。二，兩面派充滿各地，佔主要地位。三，江南民衆情緒消沉。四，抗戰以來土匪普遍地皆是，到處橫行。五，大刀會由於日本的撲殺，游擊隊的橫暴，乃造成揮種阻礙。六，游擊隊紀律很　，拚命的自巳打自已，爭奪地盤。正因為自已打自已，所以便沒有力量打日本了。這是六月以前的情况。（二）我們軍隊進入以後，幾個月中戰鬭的結果，工作的結果是：一，除了×人據點以內的，偽政權是普遍的取銷了，中國的政權是普遍的建立恢復起來了。二，兩面派銷聲匿跡了。三，壤的武裝部隊有的解散了，有的改編了。四，爭取大刀會配合作戰。五，民衆組織，一般說相當建立起來了。六，民衆抗戰情緒已大大的提高了，這是本軍進入江南地區以後的變化。（三）將來的趨勢，江南的　爭形勢是一天天緊張，　爭是一天天尖銳，我們估計到江南今後的情勢，將有更深入的發展，在鬭爭更激烈，更艱苦的情形下，若沒有廣大羣衆組織的開展，少數動搖分子部分的分化是必然的，不僅軍民要合作，而且要軍政一致，為了適應江南將來更艱苦的狀况，這是必要的，不過目前的情况，軍政還是分離的，而且是背道而馳，這與將來的發展不適合，而應當急於要改正的。（未完）</p>

<p>【上海通訊】上海市各界國民精神總動員協會，於本年三月廿二日正式成立，分界組織，亦在積極進行中，工界之國民精神總動員協曾，亦巳成立，其他晨界，商界，職業界，文化界等，亦將于日內組織成立。上海市各界國民精神總動員協曾，頃發表告同胞書，勸勉全市民衆努力六事，茲照錄如次：</p>
<p>全市親愛的同胞們，自我最高領袖蔣委員長通電全國宣布實行國民精神總動員綱領後，全國同胞，都一致接受最高領袖這偉大的啟示。本市民衆，更興奮異常，大家都深信，在這後期抗戰中，精神的重要，更過於物質，要發揮抗戰的力量，不但要振作精神，集中精神，而且要以精神為主，物質為用。提高了全國國民堅强奮發的精神，方可克服一切的艱難，打破橫暴的×人。現在本市各界同胞為澈底奉行這綱領起見，組織工作，已積極推進。我們預計於最短期間，農工商學各界民衆，均可按照其職業部門之不同，分別參加分界組織的單位。在全市精神動員開始之今日，關於民衆精神生活上有須首先注意的六事，本會願與全市同胞，共相勗勉：</p>
<p>參加團體生活</p>
<p>自抗戰軍興，特區的居民，突增至四百萬人以上，在淞滬戰役時，不論男女老幼，或服務於戰地，或支援於後方，大家參加抗×救亡的組織。及國軍西撤，受到客觀環境的限制，救亡工作，化整為零，各個站在自己的崗位上，加緊努力。現在後期抗戰，業已急劇開始，其任務之艱鉅偉大，勝前百倍，我同胞自必須加強抗×力量，以與後期抗戰局勢，密切配合；那麼各個站在崗位上之努力，實有復歸於集體奮鬥之必要，現在本會已正式宣告成立，各界組織，於日內卽將分別成立，望我全市農界同胞，參加　界國民精神總動員協會之支部組織，工界同胞，參加工界之支部組織，敎育界之敎職員及學生，參加敎育界之支部組織，文化界同胞，參加文代界支部之組織。其他市民，婦女，靑年等，也應該參加其本界之支部組織。總之，每一個市民，都必須參加國民精神總動員協會，一致向集體奮鬥之途邁進。</p>
<p>集中組織力量</p>
<p>自蔣委員長宣布實行國民精神總動員綱領後，本市有一部份民衆，自動建立組織，竭力推行，這當然是一個很好的現象，現在本會宣告成立，我們為集中力量起見，要求巳成立的各種組織，全部參加本會，在消極方面，可免紛歧錯雜之弊，在積極方面，我們更可集中一切的力量，為抗建大業而努力這一點，我們深信這一定可獲得全市同胞的贊助和同情的。</p>
<p>堅定抗戰意志</p>
<p>後期抗戰，業巳急劇展開××深知侵略戰之前途，，祗有泥足日深，國力日衰，所以最近的軍事侵略與政治陰謀，密切配合，企圖以其最狂虐的兇燄，威脅我抗×的精神，動搖我必勝的信念。其實我全國軍民，深信中日間百年來的血債，必須於此次抗戰中全部索償，更深信唯有舉國抗戰到底，才可以爭取我國家之獨立自由與平等；所以×縱竭盡野蠻慘酷之能事，非特不足威脅我精神，反增加我抗戰必勝的信念；非但不足搖動我意志，反堅定「不逐××，誓不休止」的决心。我們抗戰的精神，必須於××威脅壓迫我加甚的期間而愈發掦蹈厲；我們抗戰的意志，必須於國民精神動員運動展開的今日，而愈堅强鞏固；凡一切×人漢奸所製造的和平空氣，與妥洽消息，皆須絕對排斥澈底糾正。</p>
<p>掃除畏怯心理</p>
<p>自國軍西撤後，上海雖成孤島，然全市民衆，非特絕無長怯的心理，而且抗×救亡的精神，更形堅强奮發。尤甚於淞滬抗戰之時。紀念節日，全市家家戶戶，國旗飛掦，卽使受到無理的干涉，也决不受絲毫的威脅，而有所觀望。然亦在因為三一二的不屈不撓的英勇反抗，始造成三二九的萬戶輝煌光明滿眼，使××漢好，均無所施其伎倆，此種大無長的精神，正是我中華民國國魂的表現，也就是我國必可爭得最後勝利的堅强保證，無所謂危險，惟危險方有意義，無所謂犧牲，惟犧牲始有價値—畏怯只是自殺的工具—反抗方是制勝的條件，這是世界民族與亡史中，已有鐵的證明，毫無疑義的。在此國民精神總動員開始實行的今日，畏怯心理，自應掃除凈盡，大無畏精神，更當發揚光大。</p>
<p>發揚國民精神</p>
<p>在這國軍西撤一年餘的期間，上海同胞，熱愛祖國的情緒，為舉世所共見，政府力量，雖已不及，但我同胞服從政府的法令，尊重政府的意旨，始終無間，這種偉大崇高的國民精神，實為中外所共欽。我們希望全市同胞，今後更應把這國民精神，發揚蹈厲，如有假借特殊勢力，作遠法亂紀之事，當集中一切革命力量，予以最嚴厲的制裁，務使在這偉大光榮的抗戰建國歷史上，不要留下一絲一毫的污點。</p>
<p>砥礪民族氣節</p>
<p>在我立國五千餘年的史册上，每逢國家遭遇最艱困的時代，磅礴無間的民族氣節必更為發揚光大。此次抗戰軍與，不論都市或鄉鎭，可歌可泣的事實，報不絕書，這就是一個最顯明的證據。我全市同胞，當保持並發揚這種民族氣節，人人抱定「餓死事小，辱國事大』的决心，寧可犧牲自己，决不玷辱國家，那慶，××縱　，終必屈服於我此種至剛至大的民族氣節之下！</p>
<p>以上六事，為本會掬誠告我全市同胞者，望我民衆，深加體會，努力奉行，抗戰大業之完成，實基於斯—上海市各界國民精神總動員協會總部。</p>

<h3 id="c29">英美法宣言 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>意大利侵佔阿爾巴尼亞以後，巴爾幹半島所餘五國，固巳痛感『唇亡齒寒』，而鑒於意德侵略者之『狼狽為奸』，整個歐洲亦已陷於更大危機之前，甚至因為意德侵略者的猖厥，拉丁美洲危機亦突形嚴重。這種新的形勢，固然使若干弱小國家有『國亡無日』之痛，而英法美各國亦莫不因而憂慮其國家與世界和平的命運。</p>
<p>英法美各國在這種客觀環境的威脅之下，不能不走向團結民主和平各國合力反抗法西斯侵略者之路。蘇聯和平政策亦因而開始為各方所信賴與期望。昨今兩日報載，英首相張伯倫於十三日午宣言對希臘與羅馬尼亞給予保證，法總理達拉第亦於是晚代表政府發出同樣宣言。而美總統羅斯福，亦於十四日下午對全國廣播，對極權國的侵進拉丁美洲，發出警告。由此可見民主和平各國，只有被迫走向擴大和平陣綫與反抗法西斯侵略者的前途。</p>
<p>但是英法此種宣言，仍　片面的暫時的非常示弱的官言，而美國的反侵路運動亦尙朱發展到足以打擊×人的必要程度，這種宣言和表示，並不能眞止制止侵略制止大戰，當屬毫無疑義。昨日路透社倫敦電亦已傳出十三日張伯倫宣言發表後，羅馬柏林現仍强硬的消息了。誠如英工黨領袖阿特里所說：『我們需要一種眞正的保證政策，我們需要建立經常的集體安全政築，而非一種僅慬要求苟安於一週或半月的政策，我們如果要求避免戰爭，我們　要獲得足够强固的力量以遏止一切侵略，因此，當我們未聞蘇聯地位被提及之時，不能不表示特殊的遺憾！』</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>在心理學未嘗發達之前，對於不凡的天才兒童無法了解，就只好稱他為「神童」了。</p>
<p>天才只是一種「可型性」；社會化的集體生活代替個人主義的單調生活之後，更容易說明「時代」「環境」是助長天才發展的一個重要的因素。這　所要報道的范政，就是這樣的一個小孩。</p>
<p>他是一個十三歲的男孩子，失地東北的吉林是他的老家。長得淸秀伶俐，一口平北話亦說得十分動聽。</p>
<p>他的家庭是一個『書香世家』的大家庭，大多數是讀書人。八歲的時候他的父親到河南敎書，他就跟到河南的扶輪小學念書。過了一年多，又跟父親囘到北平去，進入北平師大附小肄業。因為老師不抗日，他就和幾個小朋友離開了學校，犧牲了將可以拿到手的小學文憑了。這個時候正是一十五年的寒假，在北平新報的『兒童生活』週刊，就是他跟小同志們主編的玩意。亦是他們的精神與活力所寄托的一個園地。</p>
<p>恰巧新安旅行團從上海北上綏遠勞軍，道經北平，他們的「兒童生活」出版歡迎專頁，從此就和新安旅行團見了面。大家在一起生活，越來越親密，二十六年的三月，范政正式加入全國唯一的兒童團體，新安旅行團了。開明的爸爸允許他的要求。慈愛的媽媽就有點兒不放心。「幾個月就囘來的」他這樣堅決地哄着媽媽，從此接受生活教育的洗禮，踏上了偉大的征途。</p>
<p>從北平到綏遠，從綏遠再到寧夏，這一段路程大部份是靠自己的「雙脚車」跑的。剛剛跨入寧夏境的當兒，七七抗戰的炮聲就　了起來，他們新安旅行團的「學習」與「工作」，就以配合着抗戰的需要而益加活躍起來，緊張起來。從寧夏到甘肅，到陝西，到河南，一直到參加保衛大武漢的工作。在政洽部預約之下，工作的開展，來得更順利，是救亡怒潮中的一支熱流，是兒童運動史上光明的一頁。</p>
<p>他們在武漢工作了三個月，直到廣州失陷的那一天，武澳撤退的前幾天，他們才離開武漢，經長沙，到桂林工作。因為中國救亡劇團需要新安旅行團派出一位小朋友參加出國工作，范政就被他們的伙伴公推加入中救劇團，由桂林隨隊出發，經韶關，汕頭來到香港，范政這一段小史，是他自己告訴記者的。眞是一個榦練的民族小戰士。</p>
<p>記者和這位可愛的小朋友認識是在四四兒童節偕他出席紀念會的時候。他有一篇「怎樣過今年的兒童節」的文章在本報發表，亦寫得很好，和他越是談下去，越是發覺他的經驗的豐富，他看到「介紹申報兒童之友」的特寫，立刻就說，：「兒童之友早已看過了。」談到陶行知先生，他就說：『我們的老師是陶先生的學生，所以我提議稱陶先生為「太老師」』，眞是乖得很—談到歌詠，他就說：『我集有很多兒童救亡歌曲，打算把他編成一本單行本，可以給香港和南洋的小朋友唱唱』！一個十三歲的小孩就有編歌集的宏願，風是「後生可畏」。</p>
<p>生活的訓練却使他的答語是「早熟」了。問到過去的經歷，他會形容汪精衛在綏遠怎樣演講「我們到了最後的關頭……」接着就批評他變成漢奸了。</p>
<p>蔣委員長雙十節檢閱救亡工作隊怎樣對着他們微笑，郭若沬先生，怎樣對他們演講，陶行知先生怎樣愛護他們，在一起時怎樣有趣，還批評陶先生的詩像馮玉祥先生的那麼一套……這些，這些，他如數家珍似的談得很神氣。</p>
<p>在一個歡迎會上，金山先生介紹他認識金仲華先生的時候，他立刻就說：「啊！在一本什麼書上，我看到你的文章，看到你的地圖。」　韜奮先生編的「全民抗戰」他亦會把這個刊物的前身二點不漏地說出來。在靑年記者學會歡迎會上，他報告出國的希望，全體無不讚嘆小孩子的不凡。他要求先生們指導他的話，亦說得巧妙，得體。——天眞活潑，博得全體的鼓掌。</p>
<p>記者詢問他：「你現在在中救劇團担任什麼工作？」「我幹的是兒童工作，　為大人工作有大人去做。」怎樣開展工作呢？他就把報道兒童運動概况，使兒童相信自已，帮助組織……說來都是經驗之談，在團體中，他的工作是獨當一面的，雖然他是一個小孩。</p>
<p>偉大的時代，偉大的環境，訓練出這樣優秀的小孩子，訓練出這樣精幹的小戰士，這正是象徵着民族的新生，國家的光明！奇卓</p>

<p>【韶關通訊】中央最近召開全國生會議、决定先從農業着手、當經分令各省乘時發展內地農村事業、戮力推動各種生產、期能充裕長期抗戰資源、查粵省主席李漢魂自奉到中央命令、曾一度召集本省與農業有關機關會議、對於本省內地農業生產計劃、已有整個决定、最近李主席以現時內地農村、因環境影響、金融缺乏、為當前之最大困雖、為調劑起見、擬撥欵繼續舉辦農村貨欵、并恢復各縣農村促進貸欵委員會、負責辦理、茲將各該項進行探誌如下、</p>
<p>恢復各縣　農貸委會</p>
<p>查本省各縣　村促進貸款委員會、在粵局未變以前、經由省銀行農村貸款部、會同農林局糧食委員會等機關、推動各縣組織成立、并由省行向中央中國交通農民四大銀行借款二百萬元、分期交由各縣會轉貸　縣合作社、調劑農村經濟、嗣因粵省戰事發生、貸欵事宜、無形停頓、李現主席以現時本省局勢、有乘時恢復、以協助農村之必要、特面論財政廳長兼省銀行長顧羣、會同農林局、計劃恢復各縣農村促進貨欵委員會、顧兼行長奉諭、已决定成立健全機關、負責辦理、聞擬除會同農林局組織外、并將邀請第四戰區糧食管理處參加、共同成立本省戰時農村促進貸欵總會、在該總會未成立以前、各縣農貸會、先行恢復、昨已由省行農貸部會同農林局、通飭各縣、尅日籌備恢復事宜云</p>

<h3 id="c51">蘇聯影業改變作風　開始攝製愛情影片　快樂人們為第一聲 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>電影事業在蘇聯、是佔看很重要的地位、但是蘇聯的電影跟他國不同、絕無香艷、愛情、神怪、等片子、都是純粹硬性的歷史片、和戰爭片、因此這　才可使電　影帮助五年計劃的進行、也可以替史太林　了宜傳的義務、所以條聯的初期電影大都是時事片和宣傳片、自從第二次五年計劃開始之後、因民衆對文化娛樂的程度提高、才有了以下作、社會、戀愛等做材料來做主題的電影、亞力山大洛夫導演的「快活的人們」是此類軟牲影片的第一砲、</p>
<p>卡通片和彩色片、好像剛生下來的小孩子一樣的幼稚、而且片子並不多、其中好一些的像彩色片「馬戲班」和卡通片「新的加里」、至於像「白雪公主」一類的五彩卡通片、到現在還沒有發現過、</p>
<p>歷史片中最有名的是了彼得大帝」、頗得世界人士之好評、此片規模的宏大、不亞於好萊塢的「百萬金元巨片」、</p>
<p>「紅軍十三勇士」和『最後一夜』二片、為紀念革命將士的偉蹟而攝製、些一片之劇情和演員均不夢、惜無能幹活潑的導演、所以有些美中不足、</p>
<p>名片「夏伯陽」是叙述內亂時代一英雄、此片是有聲片中的傑出、打破了「波丹金」時代的電影紀錄、去年新片中、獲得最高評價的片子是羅姆導演的「十月的列寧」此片是集合全國影星的偉大鉅片、</p>
<p>最近蘇聯電影漸偏重於國防方面的問題、攝成的片中、如「邊城的一日」、「為了祖國」等、都是以邊境糾紛及間諜等為題材、為增强國民的國防觀念、</p>
<p>現在正在攝製的一片『共產靑年城」是描寫共產工人的生活、這無非又是共產主　的宣傳片、還有一片是以帝俄時代的一個民間英雄為題材、在這片中、有敵國軍隊在結冰河面上狼狽退走、後來冰的裂而溺斃、遺場面、實是攝影技術在蘇聯的電影史上空前的一頁、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府因為鑒於電影人才的缺乏，影界前途的渺茫，所以最近在首都郊外設了一個電影學校，栽培着二千多個明星·導演，佈影員，攝影師等人才，畢業後就由政府保送他們到影片公司去服務，並且還把榮譽勳章贈給他們，獎勵他們巷祖國効力，</p>

<p>中國製片　出品的「熱血忠魂」（該片曾在重慶本港各地開映）最近在紐約羅斯福戲院獻映、這是中國抗戰影片在美公映的第一部、該片的英文譯名是「抗戰到底」、對白雖為華語、但因為有英文字幕、所以中外觀衆都能看得懂、</p>
<p>這片子不但表現了中國電影技術有極迅速的進步、而且還有更大的意義、那就是昭示中國軍民對於抗戰的熱誠和忠勇、使同情中國的友邦人士、看了有更進一步的認識、</p>
<p>該片公映後、各報都一致頌揚、就是握着美國電影雜誌權威的『綜合娛樂』也認為『……這是一部同情於中國民衆的觀衆所喜歡看的影片。而許多從　見過以現代故事為題材的中國電影的觀衆們也將因此片而使他們的願望滿足……故事是說明中國正在一　向侵略者反抗。它充分顯出現代中國軍人盡忠國家的偉大精神……無論如何、演出上是能够獲得觀衆們的同情的、』</p>

<p>他能唱幾句歌兒、他能跳幾下舞、並且、他還具有一副使女人們傾倒的、有誘惑性的輪廓、但是、現在這職業、却使他頭腦發漲、自從、他和秀莉卡女士合作以來、『哈立范是自由了』、這句話、巳經成了他的口頭禪了、他長長的透了一口氣、站起身來、離開了他的化裝檯、他忽然驚奇起來、因為、他看見在已經關上了上了的門前、倚着一個女郎、她輕輕的走進了他的更衣室、他竟一點沒有覺得、</p>
<p>那女郎看着他、這種看法、使哈立引起一陣煩擾、他使出素來對付這種女子的慣態、浮燥的說道、『好吧、你要我為你做些什麼事、若是要簽紀念册、對不住得很、我從來就沒有學讀書和寫字、』</p>
<p>那女郎笑一笑、搖搖頭。哈立注視他一眼，覺得她長得倒挺不錯，她滿頭的紅髮。發着紫銅色的光，一雙蔚藍的妙目，義瀝的在望着他。</p>

<p>【本報專訊】甲組足球聯賽、算賬多月、算出南華南、海軍、東方　續分表中的前三名、</p>
<p>由東方以下的隊伍、均已賽足二十場、功德圓滿、惟海軍對南南第二循環賽、却延至今天才舉行、</p>
<p>南南已賽十九場、得分三十、海軍也已賽十九場、得分廿九、故因相差一分的關係、遂造成今天此役的重要性、為競爭錦標的最後關頭、</p>
<p>我們期望華隊能够包辦錦樓、創一光榮紀錄、故而對今天此役、咸祝南南得勝、莫弄到為山九仞、功虧一　、</p>
<p>如果南南不負我們期望而完成最後的勝利、則不獨榮獲聯賽冠軍、抑亦足以建築包辦錦標的地位、更臻穩定、</p>
<p>我認為、今天南南非勝不可、如其得勝、則有三點意義、第一點乃得聯賽冠軍、取乃弟（南華華）去屆的光榮堆位而代之、尙未許別人問鼎、第二點如這囘可以克海軍、則來週末、和杯第三戰、亦可穩操左券、因而今天此役、即是爭奪旭和　的試金石、第三點南南在日前受阨於警察的時候、適値東方亦挫海軍、南南遂得仍居於超然地位、但切不要忘記東方間接的帮忙、應該有以報德、最好趁今天的機會、殺退海軍、旣可爭得一己的光榮、亦可助東方課一出路、為的是海取如敗、則績分恰與東方相同、便須多來一次亞軍决賽、那末、東方或會亦勝海軍、一躍而登次席了、</p>
<p>還有一點、我華隊要包辦錦標、非連挫海軍不為功、因為六大錦標、刻下我華緣己獲其二、所餘三項、為聯賽、國際賽及旭和杯賽、而聯賽與國際賽的錦標問題、在今天及明天當先後解决、可是最湊巧的、聯賽及旭和杯賽、我華隊俱與海軍作爭標遭遇戰、故毫無疑義的、海軍乃係我華隊的陣碍物、包辦錦標與否的關鍵、亦在　是、</p>
<p>此幕聯賽爭錦戰、足球總會原欲提早於本月　旬舉行、但未得海軍的同意、蓋海軍以提早舉行、殊不利於己隊、因為本月初旬兵艦尙多出海、健將未得齊集、故遲至今天才與南南會師、而海軍所抱野心、亦可想見了</p>
<p>日前、記者從海軍有關係方面調查、得悉海軍應戰陣綫、大致擬定、但屆時有無更勤、尙未可知、細看軍帖中、多是　人、名兒很陌生、故他們的本領如何、還是一個謎局、須戰事爆發後才揭曉、</p>
<p>舊人則有韓尼維路、軒地、岩十德郎、拖般四位、球藝都好、亦早為一般球迷賞識了、至於新人的功夫、相信必不錯、因為目下泊港兵艦、有十餘艘之多、他們若非優秀份子、决不會入選的、而且此役是海軍的生死關頭、除了决心求勝之外、失收固絕望、和局亦不行、既然戰事如此重要、人選亦必恤重、故有一　球迷以為海軍多調新人上陣、實力或非强勁、深替南南歡喜、但我覺得、此點絕不可喜、反為可慮、為的是海軍旣多新人、虛實未知、若其因多用新人而實力更增的話、則南南取勝、未必有把握、希望南南諸將謹愼從事、</p>
<p>依我所見二海軍左內衛軒地、球藝雖佳、但打來不十分穩健、右前衛韓尼維路惟能忠於職守、位置却非得當、右翼岩士德郎很矯捷、切中術也準繩、左內　拖般擅盤運、惟射門術不甚高明、然海軍的前鋒、從來也都缺乏臨門的最後一脚、</p>
<p>然海軍能够達到這個地位、與南甫爭標、他們自然另有特長、不是倖而得此、以我們所知、海軍的戰略、雖無一定方式、但聯絡是他們所重視、演出進退有方、而前鋒亦常肯閩刺、藉以彌補他們射衛的不足、故南南守將、應提防他們此種突然衛擊的舉動、</p>
<p>因為麥紹漢抱恙、南南防衛方面、逐有更動、調李國威打左內衛、郭英祺充右前衛國威在特別銀牌决賽時、嘗任此職、演出不錯、以他的爽辣脚頭、今天對付海軍前鋒定必勝任愉快、但望小心一點、够爽則無問題、過辣恐怕弄出禍來、英祺任前衛比任前鋒來得精伶、供傳亦好、惟劉慶才任右前衛、似覺步驟不慣、甚多破綻以其不慣而不為改善、　足累事、最好他與英祺對調、因為英祺左右成宜、把守左方固不成問題、所成問題的乃在慶才身上而巳、</p>
<p>包家平復出守門後、層見佳作、的是輪老手、今天仍戀情他出膺重任、實勝於張榮才、而且浙軍前錄「門檻」不精、家平自會應付裕如、用不着我們祖心、他更富有指揮之才、在一場重要比賽、更少他不得、</p>
<p>關於此次爭標戰、曾有人向南華献議、最好邀李惠堂上陣、但惠當早己聲稱不參加聯賽、雖邀請亦未必得他的同意、</p>
<p>南華足球部幾位軍師、對於今天應戰的前鋒線、會縝密考慮過、他們終嫌李恩良經驗尙新、少不更事、故决意起用宿將葉北華、出充左內鋒、在三四年前、北華曾任此職、與馮景祥有默契合作後來因足傷及在廣東省府供職的關係、乃停止在球場活動、去月自汕　返港、見臘心喜、復行綀習、日前星華與華聯表演賽二他巳與球迷們再相見了、刻因南南前綫需要人材、他遂復為母會効力、相信他在前線、比恩良勝得多、而且與景祥合作慣、彼唱此和、定收聯絡之效、前線亦　為活動而無疑了、</p>
<p>北華上陣、前線的戰略、會側重三角式短傳、景祥居中、左右兼顧、責任更大、但一味短傳、未易收效、尙須見機而利用兩翼、能够四面夾攻、才是上策、並　羅斗文振奮精神、莫因循累事、致誤戎機、</p>
<p>總之南南勝利呼聲甚高、千萬努力、務求必勝、則大好錦標、非南南莫屬了、錄兩陣及各隊績分如下（球場太歲）</p>

<p>— 施利華</p>
<p>四月二日從杳港動程、一上船就知道慶元輪需　廣州灣及北海、向船上買辦詢問、答謂、快則五日可到、遲則六日、誰知抵海防在七日上午、趕赴河內、四時三刻抵河內境、五時五分卽戎裝登陣、果然「馬到成功」、卽以四比一獲勝首場、三比零冉度勝利、備受僑胞歡迎、至為快慰也、</p>
<p>全隊十七人、頗多不慣航海者、計在船上第一次晚餐時、十—人俱在、第二次滅爲十五人、第三次一人、第四次無人、第五次七人、此後又恢復原狀、每次十七人齊全、談笑風生、食量　旺、蓋給自廣州　開出時風橫吹而來、船身巔播特甚、而自海口以後、風平浪靜、如在長江中也、以暈船之程度計、最甚者為許文奎、以次序言、則張金海、吳祺祥、曾仲雲、于洽與、陳炳土等、而桑榆及余敢謂最能耐浪者矣、</p>
<p>最前兩場之射門紀錄、簡單言之、則為</p>
<p>曹秋亭三球、李德祺二球、許文奎、張金海各一球、</p>
<p>但遠征隊得許、曹、張之加入、前鋒綫異常勁强、且各人踢法均在船中互商、能互相默契、尤以兩內鋒之低傳、為河內足球界所認為「不弱於南華」、以個別言之、當可有如下之評述、</p>
<p>劉顯漢冷靜鎭定、撲救適時、苗華國大脚解圍、且能力阻敵錄前進、一般批評、較促云為佳、然仲雲亦穩健如昔、但脚法及速度、似不及在港最後二三賽也、許竟成衣然勇猛、兩賽中試射四次、三次中鵠、且甚頸急惜均被一拍而出、但其奔跑全場之威風、似較在港時略减、蓋　本不必如是賣力也、羅偉權之地位及輸送均佳、演出在巔　　狀態、吳祺祥亦進步非凡、且奔跑有力徐步雲、非前衛材、下次當改充內衛、</p>
<p>前鋒綫、李德祺依然故我、但可嘉許者、甚肯買力所進兩球亦佳、許文奎之輕鈎妙傳、及一跳過人之姿勢、已為河內人士所稱讚、張金海努力、且位置良好、曹秋亭第一場優於第二場、腳上功夫似優於侯澄滔、但速度不及、陳炳土因足踝微傷、兩賽未有驚人表演、然兩賽之最後十分鐘、彼則為最佳之一人、於洽興與許張頗能聯絡、但胆小耳、</p>
<p>然以射門技術而言、當推文奎最佳、亦最惹人欣賞、臨空挾射、美　之至、而秋亭射刁路、常爲對方門將防不勝防、德祺怪腳毅然、第三場之一球、自已亦莫明其妙而中鵠者也、</p>
<p>此外、則劉顯漢放進一隻（並非其過、蓋當時面對三敵鋒而無內衛、實無能為力也）、縣偉權失去一十二碼球（其實踢來不壞、惟乙隊門將勇悍、撲救成角球）</p>
<p>第一戰係對軍聯、此隊以體格魁梧見稱、但射門缺少功夫、上半場形勢頗為平均、下半場至終塲前十五分鐘、東方始露鋒鋩、速獲兩球、蓋東方隊員舟車勞頓、一時難有平進狀態也、</p>

<h3 id="c67">秀才造反 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 星在天</p>
<p>前人有句話說：</p>
<p>『秀才造反，三年無成』</p>
<p>所謂三年無成，並不是說過了三年第四年就會成功了，乃是永遠不會有成功的意思。</p>
<p>細攷『秀才造反三年無成』的道理，第一，大概是因為秀才膽量小，疑　多，不足以當遠謀應大難，創大業。所謂秀才，當然是靠文學出身的軟骨文士，歷史顯示出各時代的文士，都是下賤的居多，善謟媚主子權貴，與當代統治者的居多，這種文士，大多是搖旗吶喊。或是暗地出謀劃策，如果眞的交給他一根長鎗，讓他殺出重圍，或是斬將搴旗文士是一定不會做的。不止不會，簡直可說他不敢，因為他還戀戀於名利世界，願意苟存再為另個主子盡些忠誠，享些名利之福，秀才造反之所以不能成功者，最大的理由，或者如此。</p>
<p>第二，秀才的心口常不一致，說的不是老實話，行的却是鬼祟的偷摸行為，但是在公開的地方，却大放厥詞的竟說冠冕堂皇的話。古例且不必舉，權舉近例，就如汪派人所倡的投降主義，在表面上完全說是救國家民挨，在暗中却是和中華民族的公×私相交好，訂約，拿欵項。他們在外面說會某是「殉國」其實又何嘗是「殉國」？言不由衷，大多類此。</p>
<p>假使他們堂堂正正地表白出來賣國的行動和條件，公請國人，請國人自擇，罵也由國人罵，但是却不然，他們反而裝做忠心謀國的子，暗地和日本人商訂了條款，同時口口聲聲說「我們並沒有行動」！</p>
<p>陳權儒狂夫之言卷一有條論謀臣之所以不能成功的理由，說：</p>
<p>「狡兎死，走狗烹，敵國破，謀臣亡，自古鮮有晚此局者，蓋亦有故，大抵謀臣中王佐最少，雜伯者最多，陽施陰翕之謀，躡足附耳之態，一時雖若效忠其君，未有不貌屈而心醜之者。豈惟醜之，抑且懼之矣。」</p>
<p>文中所指的謀臣還是指了忠心為祖國的，因了他的『陽施陰翕之謀，躡足附耳之態』，倒反惹起主子的不信任與疑憀，喪掉性命，又何况忘了祖國，投降×國的謀臣呢？</p>
<p>鄭孝胥半生事業，都奉獻了日本人，結果落個『走狗烹』的結局，今日的汪某，其末路也是不雞想像的，又何况像汪某這樣的投降人才，狡猾善變，臨危變節，遇難退縮，更是建國不成謀叛有餘的中下人物，今日雖能盡施『躡足附耳之態』，取悅一時，但至終依然不會脫外于『狡兎死，走狗烹』的先例的。</p>
<p>狂夫之言卷一另處又有語云：</p>
<p>『祿餌可以釣天下之中才，而不可以啖嘗天下之豪桀，名航可以載天下之偎士，而不可陸沉天下之英豪』，觀夫汪某的兩次受欵四百萬金票，更知道他不過只是一個酒色名利之徒，背棄祖宗的一個狂妄的猥土，他又怎能嘗到沐猴而冠的傀儡皇帝的滋味，因之可以稱汪派人的為虎作倀的叛亂，是秀才造反。</p>

<p>— 荘瑞源</p>
<p>椅子上不再坐着一個人，窗口上不再倚着一個人，床上不再睡着一個人，然而人仍然不是沒有。那天顫戰的手執着長旒的旗子，站在××驛上，看見他微笑着，哭泣着去的。那彷彿是古代披着甲冑，執着長矛，馳騁在征騎上蓋世英雄。是的，歷史上，被這些征夫造成幾次有名的殘殺，有名的掠劫，縱火。他應該還在東亞的大陸上，帶着怯懦的避難符英勇地舉起毒烈的火，向人類作着獸的搏擊吧。無意間，我們從逃亡的路上背轉臉去，却看見縱火者的淚。</p>
<p>相片中的人只會微笑，是不會說話的。只會笑，却也永遠停止不了那樣的微笑。而且，人是縮小了，變成八寸，裝在鏡框中，掛在壁上；更縮小了。變成四寸，夾在書本中，揣在懷裏。</p>
<p>像在懷念着一個被追逐的賊似地，祈社着了，要是能够平安地囘來已是太好，掠奪而成暴富，或用生命換來的顯赫是一點也不重要的。</p>
<p>她到××神社裏去。…</p>
<p>我離開書報的頂角，來到第二頁上的下端，那是一條街，我來到這街上了，街心是寥廓的，街傍的矮屋像銀色的列着，堆砌着。我只偶然看見一兩扇開着的窗，窗上掛着低垂的竹簾。</p>
<p>呀！新的寡婦街——</p>
<p>這是過於輕微的聲音，我彷彿聽見，我拋開手中的畫册，看見自己還深深地坐在一隻舊式的圈椅中。這是父親時代的古老的傢具，跟着我，它也過着流浪日子，它始終是沉思的，且分一份沉思給我。</p>
<p>天更界黑起來了。古舊的錶依然滴滴地絮語看，我知道，不久的明天，會有一隻粉嫩的手搶去我嘴角上卸着的桃木烟斗，丟到火裏去燒毀；我的打火機要被她拿到廚房裏去，為的是我們要自己燒飯，而至少我得在一次酒席上，雙頰漲得通紅，</p>
<p>因為我就要訂婚了。是的，安居着不是很好嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c70">離開了宋荘 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>徐州突圍囘憶記</p>
<p>從禹王山撤退下來時，命令上說是要退守鳳凰山，　頭山，宿羊山的，不想到宋莊休息了兩天，又一個命令傳了來，退守雲隆山！</p>
<p>雲隆山在什麼地方呢？據說是在徐州，那時，×人已悄悄的從蒙城永城之間竄到隨海路上，將黃口鐵橋炸斷，正向徐州包圍了來……</p>
<p>但我們不相信徐州就會失去的，以前由平漢路轉隴海路，經過徐州到台兒莊來時，我們對徐州只有隨便認識了一眼，便匆匆分別了，現在聽到了要退守雲隆山的命令，我們都很高興，因為我們又可以到徐州要云了。但同時，又感到了有些悲酸，這許多土地，這許多麥子將要給×人的鐵蹄凍踐踏了</p>
<p>帶着無限惜別的情意，在一天夜裏，在宋莊的老百姓的熟睡中，悄悄的離開了宋莊向徐州出發了。</p>
<p>人，一個跟一個的急急的只是走着。騎兵安逸的。騎在雄健的馬身上，半跑着搶到前面去，那用八匹大騞子拉着的重砲，慢吞吞的在隊伍的後面滾動着，黃灰可怕的向着人的鼻孔裏和嘴裏鑽，使人感到有些窒息。</p>
<p>拉軍用品的貨車，不是格格的呌着從後面趕了來，那强烈的燈光，使人不敢回過頭去對它看一看，只得站在路旁護它過去了，便混在那灰　裏追趕上前面的隊伍去。</p>
<p>天上點綴着無數亮晶晶的星星，大地是那末黑沉沉的，白天給微風撫摸着，活潑的在田野裏輕搖着的那一片極目無邊的麥子，巳被黑暗吞蝕去了。樹呈現出一團黑影，像一個巨人似立矗的着。帶着幾分寒氣的夜風，不時向着人吹來，使人感到有些冷！</p>
<p>遠近的村裏落，常給人的脚步聲引來了一陣陣的狗吠聲，除此，便一點聲昔也沒有，什麼都是這末靜靜的</p>
<p>無盡的隊伍，像一條黑流似的，默默的只是在北方的那廣大的原野裏洶湧的流着，沒有停息，彷彿都是一些鐵鑄的人馬，永遠不會疲倦似的。</p>
<p>到了天亮，為躲避×人的飛機，便停在一個只有四五家人，但人已跑空了的叫做黃光的小村莊裏休息着。到了黃昏，隊伍便沿着那浮着三四寸深黃灰的公路繼續前進。</p>
<p>拍！拍！……忽然前面傳來了一陣淸澈的槍聲，接着越來越密，在那亂紛紛的槍聲裏，炕聲也宏亮的在響着，不久，前面便浮起了一個通紅的火光，把天空都映得那麼火紅紅的。</p>
<p>『這是什麼事？』</p>
<p>『大概是同×人接觸了！』</p>
<p>但完全不像同×人接觸的樣子，隊伍沒有一點懼怕的依然前進，子彈嗚嗚的叫着從身旁掠過去。</p>
<p>轟隆！突然一個像閃電似的紅光，隨着一聲驚人的爆炸聲，亮了來起，把附近被黑暗籠罩着的村莊，都照得那未淸淸楚楚的，這使我們不禁驚異的叫了一聲，不由自主的赶快把頭縮下了去：</p>
<p>『這是幹什麼事情呢？」</p>
<p>沒有人知道。大家懷着一顆緊張的心，機械的只是跟着走着，但不久一個消息從前面傳了過來：這是奉令撤退的一枝友軍，在隴海路的大許家車站，將無法帶走的軍火自動焚毀的。這雖然是沒有辦法的事情，這雖然破壞了隴海路，使從邳縣南下的×軍，不能沿鐵路線前進，但想到那用老百姓的血換來的子彈，不能一顆顆打進×人的胸膛裏，我們都感到一稱難說的痛心！</p>
<p>一些不知什麼地方壞了的汽車遺棄在路旁沒有人管着，拖軍用品累死了的馬牛，蒙着一身黃灰躺在公路上，使人感到一種凄然，連馬牛都走死了，難道我們的這兩隻脚會抵得過馬牛的嗎，不過我們到底不是馬牛，走！走！走！</p>
<p>不停的走着，一連兩夜沒有睡過的眼睛，就好　有什麼東西壓在那眼皮上似的，那眼皮只時時是是想閉起，頭是那末昏沉沉的，已經是一種半睡眠的狀態裏，但是我們的腦筋是淸醒的，我們還是警戒着。</p>
<p>到了東方吐出朦朧的晨光時，我們好容易到了宿營地——佟村了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The New Fourth Army's Experiences and Lessons in the War of Resistance Over the Past Year <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Ying</p>
<p>The New Fourth Army's Journey in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The New Fourth Army was established in a very short time, truly emerging from the midst of the War of Resistance, which distinguishes it from other armies. It can be said that the formation and development of our army has gone through four stages up to today.</p>
<p>First Stage: Reorganization. The predecessor of our army was the Red Guerrilla forces and Red Army scattered in the southern provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, etc., which were reorganized. Since the July 7th Incident, the August 13th Incident, and other events, the Red Army and Red Guerrilla forces in various southern provinces, in order to defend the Republic of China and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation, were reorganized into the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army on October 2nd of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), according to a military commission order. In reality, our units began to be reorganized into the New Fourth Army around January of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), and it can be said that the formal process was officially carried out and completed in the 27th year. Although our troops were scattered across seven or eight provinces in the south, covering a vast area and comprising many units, they were able to uniformly complete the reorganization under this order and the decision of the Chinese Communist Party. From January to mid-February of the 27th year was the period of reorganization for our army.</p>
<p>Second Stage: Concentration. One month after the reorganization, under the order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the New Fourth Army was to concentrate in two areas: north of the Yangtze River towards ××, and south of the Yangtze River towards ××. After February 10th, the second stage began, with the reorganized troops concentrating in the designated areas. First, the First Detachment set off from its various garrisons on February 10th, followed by the Second and Third Detachments in succession. The units north of the Yangtze River also gradually concentrated towards the ×× area. Our military headquarters moved from Nanchang to southern Anhui on April 10th. Although the vast majority of our troops were separated by more than 2,000 li, and most of them marched on foot, they finally completed the concentration on April 10th. After the concentration was completed, the commander-in-chief of the war zone sent personnel to ×× to inspect the concentrated troops. From February 10th to April 10th was the second stage.</p>
<p>Third Stage: Advancement and Deployment of Troops. When our troops had completed concentration, we received another order from the commander-in-chief, instructing us to quickly advance and move to the operational areas for combat. This order, issued on April 15th, tasked us with establishing a guerrilla network in the designated areas, attacking the enemy, disrupting their transportation, and establishing guerrilla base areas in the specified regions.</p>
<p>After our troops completed inspection, they began to advance towards the designated areas and operational areas on April 28th. This was the day our army's advance detachment moved forward. This advance detachment was organized from a portion of our troops south of the Yangtze River, and its mission was to understand and scout the advance routes and combat situations to facilitate the movement of the main forces. After the advance detachment set off, the main forces followed in succession, entering the operational areas south of the Yangtze River along with the advance detachment. At the same time, our headquarters also moved to the southern section in May to command all operations. From April 20th onwards, we were both moving into the operational areas and engaging in combat. This was the third stage of our army's War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Fourth Stage: Combat. After our troops advanced to the operational areas and formally deployed, they officially engaged in combat. (A) First, when the troops north of the Yangtze River arrived at the designated operational area (May 16th), it was when the × people were attacking Hefei, attempting to cross the west bank at the east bank of Chaohu Lake. The first battle of our army began at Jiangjiahekoux. The battle resulted in the complete defeat of the × people at Chaohu. They captured eleven guns and one Japanese flag. This was the first victorious battle of our army north of the Yangtze River. (B) Second, the second battle south of the Yangtze River took place south of Zhenjiang on June 18th, which can also be said to be the first victory south of the Yangtze River. This time, we intercepted cars heading south from Zhenjiang. Except for one that escaped, all were destroyed, and Major Doi of the Japanese army and Captains Umeoka Takeo were killed. More than ten long and short guns and other military supplies were captured, along with more than 7,000 Japanese yuan. This was the first victorious battle south of the Yangtze River. Since May 16th north of the Yangtze River and June 18th south of the Yangtze River, we began to engage in combat. From then on, the most intense battles were fought both north and south of the Yangtze River. This kind of combat was based on the tasks given to us by the commander-in-chief, achieving the completion of the tasks through combat. And these combat tasks were still the tasks of guerrilla warfare. Until the end of September, we received another order from the commander-in-chief instructing our troops to accept the positions of the friendly forces along the Qingyi River. On October 7th, a detachment went to the area along the Qingyi River to take over the positions. This was when our army began to undertake localized positional warfare. In this stage, most of the fighting was guerrilla warfare, and a small part was positional warfare. In terms of the army's firepower, our army's firepower was very weak, and without strong firepower, it was impossible to undertake positional warfare. However, for the needs of the War of Resistance, and to facilitate the operations of friendly forces on the same front, we had to reluctantly accept this task and complete it. Some people say that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army do not fight positional warfare, and that they refuse positional warfare. Those who say these things do not understand or misunderstand the situation. We can say that our firepower is worse than that of any other army. An army with weak firepower cannot undertake positional warfare and cannot complete positional warfare tasks. But for the sake of the War of Resistance, as long as it is beneficial to the War of Resistance, even at the cost of greater sacrifices, we must accept this task and strive to complete it.</p>
<p>This explains the four stages of our army's War of Resistance: the first stage, reorganization; the second stage, concentration; the third stage, advancement and deployment; and the fourth stage, combat. These four stages are what our army experienced in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938).</p>
<p>An Overview of the New Fourth Army's Operational Journey and Combat Achievements</p>
<p>An overview of our army's operational journey and combat achievements: this is to say, what was the journey of our fighting in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) and the battles fought?</p>
<p>First, our operations can be divided into two stages. In terms of time, although the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) was a full year, in the twelve months, because we had to reorganize, concentrate, advance, and deploy, the actual time spent in combat was only seven and a half months north of the Yangtze River and six and a half months south of the Yangtze River. In this period of just over half a year, our operational journey can be roughly divided into two stages.</p>
<p>A is our offensive, our active offensive. In this stage of active offense, it can be further divided into two parts: first, the situation south of the Yangtze River was very chaotic before our troops entered the area. In particular, many guerrilla units with poor discipline not only failed to carry out the task of resisting Japan and coordinating with the national war effort in various areas, but on the contrary, hindered the development of the War of Resistance in this area, helping Japanese imperialism facilitate their transportation and maintain their rule. Therefore, the first task of our army was to remove the obstacles to our ability to directly attack Japanese ××ism, and to disband or reorganize the guerrilla units that hindered the people's resistance against Japan. After we arrived in this area, we first disarmed guerrilla commanders such as Zhu Yongxiang and Chen Degong, etc., who were known as "little Japanese" by the people south of the Yangtze River, and some were transferred back to the rear for reorganization. Because the removal of these obstacles was of great benefit to the operations south of the Yangtze River. At the same time, when we entered the operational area, because there was no formal Chinese army insisting on fighting in this area, and instead there were some bad guerrilla units, this led to the development of puppet regimes south of the Yangtze River. It can be said that, except for places where the power of Japanese ××ists could not reach, puppet regimes were generally established. Precisely because the development of puppet maintenance societies hindered the unfolding of the anti-Japanese situation among the people south of the Yangtze River and the raising of the anti-Japanese sentiments of the broad masses, clearing out these maintenance societies and puppet regimes was a necessary task. Only in this way could the people south of the Yangtze River be mobilized from their depressed mood and obstacles to actively participate in the War of Resistance, and to develop the anti-Japanese situation south of the Yangtze River. This is the first part of the first stage.</p>
<p>The second part is a comprehensive offensive against the Japanese ×. Subsequently, when Xuzhou fell and the × people actively attacked Wuhan, we used our greatest efforts to fight fiercely on the battlefield south of the Yangtze River to carry out the battle to defend Wuhan, and to coordinate with the friendly forces around Wuhan to achieve the task of defending Wuhan. The offensive at this time can be divided into two aspects: one towards both sides of the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway, and the other towards the Jingwu (Nanjing-Wuhu) Railway. This is the railway aspect. On the highway, towards the area between the Jinghang (Nanjing-Hangzhou) National Highway and the Jinghuhang (Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou) National Highway. From June 18th in the Yangtze River area, many battles, large and small, were fought, such as the battles of Weigang, Zhuzilin, Xinfeng, Xiafeng, Xintang, Shidong, and Xixiecun, the battle of Qilinmen in Nanjing, the attack on Sijing, the attack on Jurong, and the attack on Jiangning Station. These battles, large and small, were all part of the first stage of our operations, in which we adopted a resolute offensive against the × people, starting to coordinate with the defense of Xuzhou and continuing to coordinate with the defense of Great Wuhan. From June 18th to the beginning of September was our stage of active offensive, of resolute offensive.</p>
<p>B The second stage was due to our offensive, which forced the × people to adopt an offensive defense. They had to launch a counteroffensive against our offensive. From September 15th, the × people began a five-pronged attack on Baoyan, an area between Zhenjiang and Danyang. Later, the × people abandoned Yicheng and Piaoyang and other places, concentrating their forces to bypass the Jinghu line, and began their offensive against us. Why did the × people launch a counteroffensive? We say there are three reasons: (1) Because after our army arrived in the area south of the Yangtze River, our active offensive over three months threatened Nanjing and Zhenjiang, the strategic points and hubs for the × people's operations in the south. The Jinghu line was the lifeline of transportation, and the Jinghu and Jingwu lines were greatly disrupted by our sabotage and attacks. Frequently, our people went to Nanjing City to harass them. This threatened the Japanese ×, and to eliminate these threats, they had to counterattack us. (2) In the battlefield south of the Yangtze River, the task we undertook was only a quarter of the guerrilla area. On the one hand, it was due to the active nature of our offensive. On the other hand, because three-quarters of the area had no combat or no active combat, and the quarter of the area where we were fighting happened to be an important area for the × people strategically and for the transfer of their forces, the × people had to withdraw troops from other areas and use their main force to deal with us, to reduce their threat. Therefore, the Japanese troops in Xuancheng, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places moved in large numbers towards Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu.</p>
<p>(3) The × people's attack on Wuhan mainly relied on the coordination of the navy, the air force, and the army, not entirely on the army, but on the navy covering the army's advance towards Wuhan. Then, the Yangtze River line was its transportation line for advancement. Therefore, in order to facilitate supplying the front and transporting troops, the Japanese bandits had to remove the threat to the Yangtze River traffic, and they had to launch a counteroffensive. This is to say that in the second stage, due to our offensive, the × people launched a counteroffensive, and there were these three reasons.</p>
<p>But this counteroffensive of the × people was a defensive counteroffensive. They used the counteroffensive to achieve their defensive purpose, wanting to drive out all our troops on the Jinghu and Jinghang lines and around Nanjing to ensure their safety. Therefore, the offensive was not large-scale, and the offensive on the battle line, such as the offensive in southern Anhui, was also a kind of defensive offensive. The main purpose was to maintain the Yangtze River traffic, because the Yangtze River traffic relied on ships. We had previously organized many mobile ship groups, which made their transportation difficult, forcing them to use the army south of the Yangtze River to maintain their traffic. From the whole point of view, the × people's counteroffensive was still a defensive offensive, and we must be clear about this point.</p>
<p>Where do we see the × people's offensive? From the perspective of the overall situation of the war south of the Yangtze River, the × people now have three centers of offensive: in southern Anhui, with Qingyang as the center; in the south of the Yangtze River, one with Maoshan as the center, and one with Xiaodanyang between Nanjing and Danyang as the center. These three centers can also be said to be the strongholds of our army's operations and the base points for operations with friendly forces.</p>
<p>In southern Anhui, from September to December, the × people successively occupied Guichi, Tongling, Fanchang, and recently attacked Qingyang. In the south of the Yangtze River, the × people launched a five-pronged attack on Baoyan on September 10th, a three-pronged attack on Jiangyeqiao on the 12th, and a two-pronged attack on the 15th, one attacking Shangxingbu and the other attacking Shangpei and Lishui. On October 7th, they launched another two-pronged attack, one attacking Xinwangzhuang and the other attacking Beizhen, setting fire to Maoshan. On October 24th, they launched a five-pronged attack on the area north of Jurong. On November 10th, × attacked Jiangyeqiao again. On November 30th, they launched a five-pronged attack on Yanling. From September onwards, the × people constantly attacked our base points. At the end of September, Yanling, Huangchi, Wuxi, and Qingxiaozhen. After October 12th, the × people launched a four-pronged attack on Xiaodanyang. On December 13th, they attacked Huoli, and recently on December 21st, they attacked Zhumen. On October 17th, the × people launched a two-pronged attack on Hongxi Town. On November 30th, they launched a three-pronged attack with great force on Guyi River and other places. In southern Anhui, with Qingyang as the center, and in the south of the Yangtze River, with Maoshan and Xiaodanyang as the centers, the × people's offensive mainly wanted to prevent us from gaining a foothold in these places, forcing us to leave this area, because these three places are all our strategic strongholds. This way, they could achieve the elimination of threats and the safety of transportation.</p>
<p>In summary, the operations in the south of the Yangtze River from June 18th to December 31st can be divided into two stages: the first stage was our period of offensive, and the second stage was because of our army's offensive, the × people had to adopt a defensive offensive, creating the formation of the × people's counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Second, how many battles did we fight in total since the start of the operations south of the Yangtze River? In summary, during this period of six and a half to seven months, we fought a total of 234 battles both north and south of the Yangtze River. Among these 234 battles, 200 battles were fought south of the Yangtze River. It can be said that our battles were mainly fought south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Third, what did we gain from our battles? I would like to make a list of it. In the 234 battles, we captured 1,539 rifles and carbines, 32 light machine guns, 4 heavy machine guns, 48 Mauser pistols, and 20 pistols. The amount of Japanese money was approximately 22,738 yuan. The number of documents, coats, flags, and other military supplies is too numerous to list (statistical table omitted). In addition to these spoils of war captured in battle, we also destroyed 195 Japanese × cars and damaged 95 bridges. There is a separate statistic for damage to highways and railways. (statistical table omitted). During this period of six and a half to seven months, what was the ratio of casualties between the × and us? During this period, our army suffered a total of 664 casualties, while the × people suffered 3,232 casualties. From the perspective of the comparison between the × and us, it is a ratio of one to four and seven-tenths. It can also be said that one of us is equal to four and a half of them, which is the most cost-effective in the War of Resistance. In the past, in the War of Resistance of our army, in the positions, the ratio of casualties between the × and us was that we suffered three to five casualties for every one casualty of the × people. In the second and third phases, it was reduced to a ratio of two and five-tenths to one. Guerrilla warfare is the exact opposite. We suffer one casualty, and the × people will suffer four and a half casualties. Accumulating small victories becomes a large number. In this experience of six and a half to seven months, it can be fully seen that guerrilla warfare in the Chinese War of Resistance is beneficial to us.</p>
<p>Changes in the War Situation South of the Yangtze River and Its Development Trends</p>
<p>First, changes in the × situation. We can talk about this from two aspects: one is military changes, and the other is political changes.</p>
<p>A. Military changes can also be divided into two stages: First, the situation in the war zone south of the Yangtze River before June. Before June, the Japanese × military was centered on Nanjing, with Wuhu and Zhenjiang as strongholds, two strategic base points, and two strategic forward positions. The Japanese × forces were concentrated in these three strongholds, but the forces in each stronghold were not large. On the transportation lines of the Jinghu, Jingwu, and Jinghang National Highways, as well as the county towns or large cities and towns on both sides of the transportation lines, only a small number of troops were stationed to maintain their transportation. Before June, the Japanese × transportation could proceed smoothly without any severe blows or obstacles. The Japanese × could control and rule everything with a small number of troops, and even groups of three to five could go to the villages near the transportation lines to rape and plunder, and rarely be attacked. This is to say that before June, the Japanese × rear transportation was very safe. The total force in the three transportation strongholds, from Changchuan, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Dangtu to Wuhu, was only regularly stationed with more than two regiments. The other strongholds had no more than two platoons or one squad. Because the rear transportation was very safe, the Japanese × could withdraw most of their forces into the northern war zone, concentrating on the Huaihe and Jinpu areas, attacking Hefei and Xuzhou. This was the situation before June, but since our army entered the operational area, due to our active offensive and constant attacks, the Japanese × transportation suffered frequent stagnation, obstacles, and threats. To protect their military strongholds and strategic hubs, the Japanese × had to counterattack us. Currently, the Japanese × troop deployment is different from before. Second, the current military deployment of the × people. Currently, the Japanese × forces are scattered and concentrated in two areas, one centered on Nanjing and the other based on Wuhu. On the Japanese × transportation lines, it can be said that every major transportation route, such as every bridge, station, and corner of the highway on the Jinghu line, has a stronghold built and troops stationed. Each stronghold, not to mention large cities and small strongholds, also concentrates considerable forces to guard. Every small place has fortifications built for cover. We are moving back and forth between the Japanese × strongholds. Now the Japanese × movement or transportation must be protected by forces, and they no longer dare to go to the countryside easily with a small number of people. In total, there are two and a half to three divisions of Japanese × south of the Yangtze River, with one division centered on Wuhu, one division centered on Nanjing, and one brigade centered on Zhenjiang. In addition, more than 5,000 puppet troops have been added from North China and Manchuria. The Japanese × deployment is more strict. This is a major change in the Japanese × military deployment, and it is the result of our arrival in the area south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>B. Political trends, the political trends of the × people can also be divided into three periods: The first period is before June. 1. The burning, killing, and plundering by the Japanese army in the area south of the Yangtze River is a common phenomenon, using power to suppress the Chinese people and make them submit. 2. The guerrilla units have very poor discipline, and Japan uses this phenomenon to incite the people's feelings against the guerrilla units. They say that it is the guerrilla units that are disrupting peace and security, and that the Imperial Army is fighting the guerrilla units, using these facts to bewilder the Chinese people, which has had considerable effect. 3. It is to use two-faced people to establish its rule. The two-faced people are: when the Japanese army comes, they set off firecrackers to welcome them, and get some women to comfort the Imperial Army. They also set off firecrackers for the Chinese army. These two-faced people preside over everything, and</p>
<p>mutually do not offend each other, attempting to survive by compromising. 4. It is that the guerrilla units and the Japanese × have a tacit understanding and do not fight each other. This phenomenon was very common south of the Yangtze River in the past, and it still exists in the eastern section of the Jinghu line. 5. Such as Japan using the fact that after the Chinese army withdrew from Nanjing, there was no army to stay and fight in the south of the Yangtze River, so there was no propaganda work, and Japan could carry out arbitrary propaganda in China, and also use traitors to announce</p>
<p>news of the war. This naturally dampened the anti-Japanese sentiments of the people south of the Yangtze River. This is the first period of Japan's political actions.</p>
<p>The second period, after our army entered, Japanese imperialism engaged in large-scale activities. 1. Everywhere, they used airplanes to distribute leaflets, saying that the Red Army's fight against local tyrants was communism, attempting to create class conflicts and prevent the masses from contacting us, and to destroy our unity. However, since our army entered this area, we used our actions and our battles to prove that our army has good discipline and protects the interests of the people, causing the propaganda of the Japanese × to lose its effect. Secondly, they use power to suppress the common people to prevent them from approaching us. Otherwise, they use cannons to bombard indiscriminately and burn houses, causing the people to call for the New Fourth Army not to come, so as to avoid burning houses. But later, the places we did not go to were still the same in burning and killing, and the people gradually felt that the propaganda of the Japanese × was deceiving them. 3. Political propaganda. The × people used the pretext of anti-communism and anti-Chiang to say to the people that you are suffering from the disasters of war because of the Communist Party and Chiang Kai-shek, and that you can only achieve peace by opposing the Communist Party and opposing Chiang Kai-shek. The central slogan of the × people is to oppose the main force of the Chinese War of Resistance. This is to say that after our army entered, their previous methods were useless. 4. Adopt a gentle policy. The × people have also restrained their most barbaric actions and given a little favor to prevent the people from approaching us.</p>
<p>The third period, that is, the most recent trends. 1. Subdue local armed forces with insufficient awareness, bad elements, and wavering loyalties to become traitors. 2. Threaten two-faced people to stand on their side and become loyal tools of their rule. 3. Use traitors to divide everywhere. 4. Collude with local wavering elements, not only communicating information to them, but also belonging to their sphere of influence. 5. For armies that actively attack, they have a tacit understanding and adopt a non-aggression attitude. 6. Promote the anti-communist movement, such as the anti-communist movement rallies recently held in Nanjing and Wuhu. 7. The × people have recently used Chinese resources to make various factories start production. In Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places, Japanese people have come forward to open factories, allowing those capitalists with weak national consciousness to open factories and do business, seeking economic cooperation with Japan. The dumping of Japanese goods is being implemented in these places. In this way, on the one hand, they are developing Chinese resources, and on the other hand, they are using Chinese resources to carry out the Sino-Japanese War. The × people are politically advancing in this direction. Over the past year, the × people have had different military and political developments, and have had changes.</p>
<p>Second, the changes in our military and political situation: (1) Before June, puppet organizations and maintenance societies were universally present in the area south of the Yangtze River, and there was very little Chinese power. 2. Two-faced people filled various places, occupying the main position. 3. The people south of the Yangtze River were emotionally depressed. 4. Since the War of Resistance, bandits have been common and rampant everywhere. 5. The Big Sword Society, due to the suppression by the Japanese and the tyranny of the guerrillas, has created a kind of obstacle. 6. The guerrilla units have very poor discipline, desperately fighting among themselves and competing for territory. Precisely because they are fighting among themselves, they have no strength to fight the Japanese. This is the situation before June. (2) After our army entered, the results of several months of fighting and work are: 1. Except for within the Japanese × strongholds, the puppet regimes have been universally abolished, and Chinese power has been universally established and restored. 2. Two-faced people have disappeared. 3. Bad armed forces have either been disbanded or reorganized. 4. Strive for the Big Sword Society to cooperate in operations. 5. People's organizations, generally speaking, have been fairly well established. 6. The anti-Japanese sentiments of the people have been greatly raised. These are the changes since our army entered the area south of the Yangtze River. (3) The future trend is that the war situation in the south of the Yangtze River is becoming increasingly tense, and the struggle is becoming increasingly sharp. We estimate that the situation in the south of the Yangtze River in the future will have a deeper development. Under the circumstances of more intense and more arduous struggles, if there is no development of broad mass organizations, the partial division of a few wavering elements is inevitable. Not only must the military and the people cooperate, but the military and the government must be unified. This is necessary to adapt to the more difficult situation south of the Yangtze River in the future. However, in the current situation, the military and the government are still separated and are running in opposite directions. This is not in line with future developments and should be urgently corrected. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e2">The English People's Ardent Hopes for the British Government <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Sir George Paish, a renowned British economist, made a special trip around the world to understand the economic situation in various regions. Yesterday, upon arriving in Hong Kong, he delivered a speech brimming with insights, fully expressing how the British people hold different and ardent hopes for their government. He began by stating, "Previously, Britain thought that if dictators could be dealt with in a reasonable manner, they would become rational. However, it is now clear that this is not the case." Indeed, arrogant aggressors cannot be reasoned with; only a firm stance and concrete measures can prevent their unreasonable disturbances. George Paish correctly pointed out the British government's responsibility for the current situation, saying, "The majority of the British public has long believed that a firm policy should be adopted. It is the government, not the people, who are timid." The British government's past concessions to aggressors, which have led to the current unmanageable situation in Europe, are all revealed in these few words. One can imagine how fervently the British people expect their government to act.</p>
<p>We believe that the British government's past adoption of appeasement policies towards aggressors was not without reason. In a nutshell, it was out of fear of war and a desire for baseless peace. In fact, the result of loving peace and making concessions to aggressors is, as George Paish pointed out, "Each time we yield to a dictator, we move closer to war. I believe that the crisis of war is now approaching. If such steps—referring to sanctions against dictators—were implemented sooner, the war would not be as imminent as it is today... Now that Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are no longer yielding to dictators, I do not believe that war will occur in the near future." We have repeatedly elaborated on this principle in our articles. The British government should carefully consider these words now that the European crisis is quite profound.</p>
<p>Currently, all countries in the world recognize that "the situation is extremely serious." European observers speculate that Germany and Italy may continue to expand their influence. Italy has already mobilized some reservists, and the army's manpower is now over one million. Germany has also partially mobilized, and troops in Berlin are extremely busy. There is even talk of Italy sending troops to land in Spain. In Eastern Europe, Hungary is preparing to advance on Romania and Yugoslavia, and the Nazi Party in the Free City of Danzig is also preparing to declare the city's annexation into Germany in the near future, further complicating the major disputes. It is heard that Germany has already made harsh demands to Poland! (1) Transfer Danzig to Germany; (2) Allow Germany to build a highway across the Polish Corridor to connect Germany and East Prussia; (3) Cede the Polish territories in eastern Silesia and Upper Silesia; (4) Guarantee autonomy for the German minority in other areas. Large units of the German army have concentrated on the German-Polish border. This is tantamount to threatening Poland into concluding a treaty of surrender.</p>
<p>Most of the small countries in Eastern Europe are guaranteed by Britain. Germany and Italy's threat to these small countries also threatens Britain. Britain's attitude is indeed worthy of attention. Whether Britain can take appropriate measures will determine whether Germany and Italy's reckless actions can be temporarily halted. Britain is still conducting negotiations on guarantees to Greece and Turkey, hoping to win the position of leader in Eastern Europe. Whether Britain can achieve this goal will be determined by whether it can fulfill its guarantees to Poland. Britain is now in an increasingly important position. On the one hand, not only are the small countries of Eastern Europe vying for its protection, but France is also following Britain, expressing a very firm stance. Daladier's declaration has been published simultaneously with Chamberlain's declaration, stating that "any further acts of aggression by totalitarian states, whether against Romania, Poland, Greece, or Turkey, will draw Britain and France into the vortex of war." On the other hand, the United States is gradually actively assisting the Soviet Union in order to curb the recklessness of aggressors in the East and reduce their constraints on Britain and France in the East.</p>
<p>In today's situation, the British government should follow the will of the people and actively adopt a firm stance in Europe to deal with the two fierce powers of Germany and Italy. In the Far East, in addition to taking active action itself, it must also further help China resist the war and genuinely link up with the United States and the Soviet Union. Today, the leader of the British Liberal Party, Lloyd George, openly criticized Chamberlain for not over-believing dictators and urged Chamberlain to promptly establish a concrete military understanding with the Soviet Union. The alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should emphasize practicality and sincerity. The incomparably solid military port of Singapore should be provided for use by the United States and other countries in the future, and there should be specific provisions for various supplies to the Soviet Union. The British and French governments have now issued a final warning to German and Italian aggressors. The British people must be expecting the British government to firmly uphold its position to the end.</p>

<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] The morale of the enemy troops on all battlefields is declining, and our situation is improving. The battle in Jiangxi is at a stalemate. Our troops are still holding out against the enemy about 20 kilometers south of Nanchang, and 15 to 25 kilometers west of Gao'an, as well as in various places northwest of Wuning. The fighting is still fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 14th] On the morning of the 12th, a unit of our army searched and advanced towards the area of Lingqian Chen, northwest of Gao'an, and encountered more than 300 enemy infantry and cavalry, leading to an engagement. Many enemies were killed. As of the afternoon of that day, the fighting was still intense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 14th] On the evening of the 12th, our army dispatched a team to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's Shuikougang area, east of Huibu, near Gao'an, killing more than ten enemies and seizing many flags and documents.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] In central Hubei, our counter-offensive continues to make progress. One route in Suizhou has approached Xihe. The enemy in Zhongxiang is still surrounded by us.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] In southern Henan, a fresh force of our army attacked Xinyang again on the 12th. That night, two enemy units, each with more than 200 men, were completely annihilated west of the city, and many weapons were captured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 13th] Tongbai telegraphed this morning that the enemy who invaded west of Xinyang, seeing that our army and people were prepared, did not dare to attack. 600 to 700 enemy troops moved from Guangshui to Xinyang. A unit of our army pressed towards the enemy and stationed in the area of Jiehe Xindian Huashan. The enemy, unable to withstand the pressure, withdrew to the Liangtongshan Youhe area. The enemy at Changtaiguan shelled us, showing signs of invading northward. Yesterday morning, a small number of enemy traces were also found in Zhujiapu and Shijiapu.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] In southern Guangdong, we are still attacking Zengcheng and the suburbs of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Results of the Counter-Offensive on Kaifeng: Our Army Has Achieved Significant Results</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 14th] After our army re-entered Kaifeng, it was ultimately restrained by enemy reinforcements coming from the east, and the enemy east of Bian actively mobilized for a counter-offensive. Our army, having achieved its goal of a surprise attack, voluntarily gave up the city. By 1:00 PM, the enemy in Bian, under the cover of five aircraft, launched an attack on us. Our army ambushed a battalion on the southern embankment, luring the enemy closer and then launching a sudden counterattack. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered another 600 to 700 casualties, with only 200 to 300 escaping. On the 12th, the enemy was dealt a heavy blow twice in one day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A foreign dispatch from Shanghai on the 14th reported that when reporters inquired with the Japanese spokesperson about the situation of the Chinese army's counter-offensive on Kaifeng, it was claimed that he had not heard of it. A military observer from a neutral country said that although the Chinese army's counter-offensive on Kaifeng was not of great military value, its impact was extremely significant from a political and psychological point of view. This was because it was the first effective attack by the Chinese army on an important city occupied by the Japanese army. In addition, Kaifeng was the location of the General Headquarters of General Wu Peifu, which was built by the Japanese army. The counter-offensive was carried out, but the Japanese claimed that the Chinese army's counter-offensive had failed. Therefore, in terms of strategy, the Chinese army had indeed achieved success. However, Kaifeng is an important base for the Japanese army, and the Japanese army will definitely send heavy troops to guard it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Peiping, 14th] According to Japanese official sources received here yesterday, the fighting in Kaifeng, after the Chinese army reinforcements arrived, was still in full swing yesterday morning. The Chinese army was well-equipped and launched fierce attacks in the suburbs. It was claimed that the fighting had entered its fourth day and was becoming increasingly fierce. Japanese sources admitted that the Chinese army attacking Kaifeng had surrounded the puppet military police south of the city station and occupied the airport.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Sabotaging International Civil Aviation: It Is Said the Enemy Again Attacks Eurasia Aircraft, Philippine Clipper Detours to Hong Kong <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[This Port's News] The Japanese are extremely jealous of the development of our country's civil aviation industry and have repeatedly tried to sabotage it, but all attempts have failed. Therefore, they have shifted their anger to civil aviation aircraft of third countries related to us. After the Guilin aircraft was attacked, the Eurasia aircraft was chased by Japanese aircraft twice. In addition, the Eurasia aircraft on the Yunnan-Vietnam line was recently shot down by Japanese aircraft in French territory. According to Chongqing news, "On the 13th, an Eurasia aircraft flying from Chongqing to Hanoi was besieged by three Japanese aircraft near Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam border. The Eurasia aircraft was eventually shot down, and the German driver was slightly injured. Whether the other passengers were injured is currently unknown." The Japanese side's disregard for the interests of third countries is undeniably obvious. It is also noted that the Japanese Navy recently issued a false declaration, warning all national civil aviation aircraft not to fly over its warships, otherwise they will definitely fire upon them. Therefore, the Pan American Philippine Clipper, which arrived in Hong Kong at 2:00 PM yesterday, saw several Japanese warships patrolling while flying from the Philippines to Hong Kong. Fearing that it would be attacked, it detoured to Macau and then flew to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Eurasia Airlines flight number 19 from Yuhhe took off from Hanoi at 2:00 PM on the 13th. While flying to the airspace near Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam border, it encountered three Japanese aircraft chasing it and was forced to land. One German pilot was injured, and the details of the passengers are being investigated. It is heard that after learning of the incident, Eurasia Airlines immediately dispatched aircraft to the vicinity of Lao Cai to try to rescue them. It is noted that there were air raid alerts in various parts of Yunnan on the afternoon of the 13th, and the encountered aircraft may have been Japanese aircraft attacking Yunnan.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Great Victory in the Occupied Areas of North China: The Enemy's Plan to Sweep Through Southern Shandong Is Shattered by Us, The Bloody Battle of Jianggu Creates Supreme Glory <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Special Chongqing Air Mail News] Shandong News: The enemy in Shandong Province has recently continued to launch large-scale attacks on us. On the morning of the 29th of last month, the enemy in Lin* divided into three routes: one route of more than 200 puppet troops invaded west, reaching Zhifang in the evening; one route of more than 200 puppet troops invaded south, reaching Qingyaitou on the north bank of the Mihe River. These two units were meant to contain our forces on the flanks. Another 400 Japanese infantry, more than 100 cavalry, more than 200 puppet troops, eight artillery pieces, twenty machine guns, and 500 carts advanced along the Yi-Lin Highway, crossing the Mihe River. They were ambushed by a unit of our army. At 4:00 PM, they reached Xinzai, 30 miles north of Jianggu. On the morning of the 30th, our army lured the enemy to the Heigua Xiagu area southwest of Xinzai, and after two hours of intense fighting, more than 50 enemies were killed. At 10:00 AM, the enemy reached Zhaolingzi, north of Jianggu, and engaged in fierce fighting with a platoon of our advanced troops, killing many enemies. Later, our troops used the terrain to hide, and the enemy fired dozens of artillery shells, but we did not move. When the enemy approached, we swept them with machine guns, killing more than 50 enemies. The enemy retreated to Changzhuang. After reorganizing, they launched a concentrated artillery counter-attack on us and surrounded us from both flanks. The platoon stood firm and did not retreat, killing dozens more enemies. We also bravely sacrificed 25 soldiers. On the 30th, the enemy gathered in Jianggu, attempting to invade south the next morning. Jianggu is divided into East Valley and West Valley, both with walls. At that time, there were about 600 enemies in East Valley and about 200 in West Valley. Our army attacked both valleys simultaneously at dawn. At 5:00 AM, both valleys were captured by us at the same time. A battalion commander of our army directed the battle with his chest bared, moving back and forth in East Valley three times. One of our soldiers killed seven or eight enemy soldiers with his bare hands. Later, more than 40 enemies were found in a courtyard. Two squads of our soldiers threw grenades fiercely, killing all the enemies in the courtyard. Later, enemy reinforcements came from other places, and the two squads of our soldiers were all sacrificed. Another squad of ours killed more than 30 enemies outside the East Gate and was later surrounded and sacrificed. Our platoon leader, Ma Wenyuan, waved his knife and killed nine enemy soldiers in a row. Mr. Ma was also injured in seven places. Our company commander, Wang Haichao, after his entire company was sacrificed, still held a machine gun and killed many enemies, and finally made a heroic sacrifice. The fighting in West Valley was intense, no less than in East Valley. After the entire company of our Deputy Yang Dengfu was sacrificed, he led hundreds of guards and hacked several enemy machine gunners to death. After suffering serious injuries, he continued to kill many more enemies and finally died for the country. Geng Jiqing, the commander of our machine gun company, with a squad guarding a high ground southwest of West Valley, when the enemy detoured from the Shahe, more than 40 enemies were killed. The squad continued to advance to the outside of the West Gate. The machine gun encountered obstacles and was surrounded by the enemy. The whole squad was sacrificed. The company commander picked up a gun to repair it in the trench and was also discovered and killed by the enemy. In this battle, our army fought fiercely with the enemy from morning to noon, six hours of intense fighting, killing more than 500 enemies in total. We bravely sacrificed 18 company and platoon leaders and more than 300 soldiers. This move completely shattered the enemy's plan to sweep through southern, dealt a great blow to them, and was the greatest victory in the occupied areas recently. The local people welcomed us with food and drink, and when they talked about the heroic resistance of our army, they were moved to tears. (He Bingru, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Japan's Control Over Northwest Fur Trade in Baotou <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(1) Japan's Consistent Policy of Aggression Against China</p>
<p>(Yu Lin Correspondence) As we all know, Japan's policy of aggression against China has consistently focused on political and economic goals, with economic aggression as its foundation. This is the essence of Japanese imperialism. Since the "July 7th" Incident, Japan has launched fierce attacks on the Chinese mainland with superior weapons, while simultaneously intensifying the central work of its economic conspiracy, organizing the China Economic Affairs Bureau to control two companies: (1) North China Development Company and (2) Central China Promotion Company. These companies specialize in undermining the legal tender, seizing cash, opening up markets, and exploiting military resources.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese Establish Fur Trading Bureau in Baotou</p>
<p>Recently, a businessman from Baotou mentioned that the pseudo-North China Development Company has established a fur trading bureau in Baotou to control the fur trade in Northwest China.</p>
<p>Mr. [Name Hidden] was a member of the chamber of commerce before Baotou fell. He knows the trade situation in Baotou very well. After Baotou fell, he witnessed the brutality of the Japanese and was in constant danger of being harmed. He fled to [Place Hidden] last year and recently arrived in Yulin. He said that Baotou is the general sales center for furs from Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, and Mongolia. A large amount of fur from the Northwest accumulates here and is transported to Tianjin via the PingSui Railway. The annual export of sheep wool and cashmere alone exceeds 30 million catties. Before the Lugouqiao Incident, fur prices in Baotou soared, with sheep wool reaching 100 yuan per 100 catties and sheep reaching 300-400 yuan per 100 catties. After the fall of Beijing and Tianjin and the control of transportation lines by the Japanese, exports were affected, and fur prices plummeted, causing great hardship for fur merchants. The pseudo-fur trading bureau forced registration, prohibiting the removal of fur stored in various fur warehouses and by fur merchants. They used fake currency to buy sheep wool, setting the price at 70 yuan per 100 catties, and cashmere at 200 yuan per 100 catties (various other wool types also had fixed prices). They have already transported all the fur accumulated in Baotou over the years, but the new cashmere produced in the 27th year was not delivered in full. The Japanese then used incentives, rewarding fur warehouses with the largest deliveries to promote external propaganda and widely attract fur sources. They also posted slogans on the city walls, such as "Welcome Mongolian Nationals to Trade and Protect Fur Merchants." They have now slightly increased the fur prices to actively achieve control.</p>
<p>(3) Our Losses are Staggering</p>
<p>Over the past year, the total value of fur transported from Baotou has been approximately 20 million yuan or more. Due to the impact of the war, fur prices in the production areas of Ningxia and Shaanxi are extremely low. Some unscrupulous merchants seized the opportunity to make a fortune, transporting cashmere to Baotou to sell to the Japanese and exchanging it for Japanese goods to sell in the rear, earning considerable profits. Most of these traders are from Ningxia and northern Shaanxi, transporting goods through Mongolia. This phenomenon, although caused by the ignorance of merchants, is also due to the lax blockade of the river crossings.</p>
<p>(4) Hope that the Central Government Establishes Fur Exchanges in Ningxia, Gansu, Xia, and Yulin</p>
<p>I previously read an article in the 15th issue of "Northwest Forum," titled "Resisting Japanese Purchases of Fur from Suiyuan, Mongolia, Ningxia, and Shaanxi Border Areas," which suggested that the Central Government should establish trade sub-bureaus in Yulin to specialize in purchasing fur from the Northwest. This has not yet been implemented. Now, we still hope that the authorities will petition the Central Government to quickly establish trade sub-bureaus in Ningxia and Yulin, establish fur factories, and improve production. This is the only effective way to resist. (Civil Revolutionary Society)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Shanghai Circles Express Solemn Opposition to Peace Conspiracy; General Mobilization Meeting Encourages Compatriots to Implement Six Matters to Complete the Great Task of Resistance <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] The Shanghai All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association was officially established on March 22nd of this year. Organizational structures are being actively established in various sectors. The Labor Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association has also been established, and organizations in the morning, business, professional, and cultural sectors will also be established within days. The Shanghai All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association has recently issued a letter to compatriots, encouraging all citizens to strive for six things. Here is a direct transcription:</p>
<p>Beloved Compatriots of the City, after our Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the entire country to announce the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, compatriots across the country unanimously accepted this great enlightenment from the Supreme Leader. The citizens of this city are even more exceptionally excited, and everyone deeply believes that in this later stage of the war of resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than that of material. To unleash the power of the war of resistance, we must not only invigorate our spirit and concentrate our spirit, but also prioritize spirit and use material as a means. By enhancing the strong and determined spirit of the national people, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat the tyrannical Japanese. Now, in order to thoroughly implement this outline, the organization work of all sectors of the city is being actively promoted. We expect that in the shortest possible time, people from all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia can participate in the units of the sectoral organization according to the different departments of their profession. On the day of the start of the city's spiritual mobilization, regarding the six things that must first be paid attention to in the spiritual life of the people, this association is willing to encourage all the compatriots in the city:</p>
<p>Participate in Group Life</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the population of the special zone has suddenly increased to more than four million. During the Battle of Shanghai, regardless of men, women, old or young, whether serving in the war zone or supporting in the rear, everyone participated in the organization of resisting Japan and saving the nation. When the National Army withdrew westward, restricted by objective conditions, the work of saving the nation was decentralized, with each person standing at their own post and intensifying their efforts. Now that the later stage of the war of resistance has begun dramatically, its tasks are a hundred times more difficult and greater than before. Our compatriots must strengthen the power of resisting Japan in close coordination with the situation in the later stage of the war of resistance. Therefore, the efforts of everyone standing at their posts must return to collective struggle. Now that this association has officially announced its establishment, organizations in various sectors will be established separately within days. It is hoped that compatriots in the agricultural sector of the city will participate in the branch organizations of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of the [Agriculture] Sector; compatriots in the industrial sector will participate in the branch organizations of the Industrial Sector; teachers and students in the education sector will participate in the branch organizations of the Education Sector; and compatriots in the cultural sector will participate in the branch organization of the Cultural Sector. Other citizens, women, youths, etc., should also participate in the branch organizations of their respective sectors. In short, every citizen must participate in the National Spiritual Mobilization Association and move towards the path of collective struggle together.</p>
<p>Concentrate Organizational Power</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang announced the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, some people in the city have spontaneously established organizations and tried their best to promote it, which is of course a very good phenomenon. Now that this association has announced its establishment, in order to concentrate our strength, we require all established organizations to participate in this association. In the negative aspect, this can avoid the disadvantages of disunity and confusion. In the positive aspect, we can concentrate all our strength and strive for the great cause of resisting and building the nation. We firmly believe that this will definitely win the support and sympathy of all compatriots in the city.</p>
<p>Strengthen the Will to Resist</p>
<p>The later stage of the war of resistance has dramatically unfolded. The [Japanese] know very well that the future of the war of aggression will only sink deeper and deeper, and the national strength will decline day by day. Therefore, recent military aggression and political conspiracies have been closely coordinated, attempting to threaten our spirit of resisting Japan and shake our belief in victory with their most tyrannical ferocity. In fact, the military and civilians of the entire country deeply believe that the blood debt of hundreds of years between China and Japan must be fully repaid in this war of resistance. They also deeply believe that only by resisting Japan to the end can we win the independence, freedom, and equality of our country. Therefore, no matter how much the [Japanese] exhaust their barbaric and cruel capabilities, they will not only fail to threaten our spirit but will increase our belief in the inevitable victory of the war of resistance; not only will they fail to shake our will, but they will strengthen our determination to "not rest until the [Japanese] are driven out." Our spirit of resisting Japan must be even more inspiring during the period when the [Japanese] threaten and oppress us more severely; our will to resist Japan must be even more strengthened and consolidated today when the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is launched; all the peaceful atmosphere and compromise news manufactured by the [Japanese] and traitors must be absolutely rejected and thoroughly corrected.</p>
<p>Eliminate the Psychology of Fear and Cowardice</p>
<p>Since the National Army withdrew westward, although Shanghai has become an isolated island, the citizens of the entire city not only have no psychology of cowardice at all, but also have an even stronger and more determined spirit of resisting Japan and saving the nation, even more so than during the Battle of Shanghai. On commemorative holidays, the national flag flies in every household throughout the city, and even if they are unreasonably interfered with, they will never be threatened in the slightest, nor will they hesitate. However, it is precisely because of the unyielding and heroic resistance of March 12 that the magnificent brilliance of March 29 was created, so that the [Japanese] and traitors could not use their tricks. This spirit of fearlessness is the manifestation of the national soul of our Republic of China, and it is also the firm guarantee that our country will surely win the final victory. There is no such thing as danger, only danger has meaning; there is no such thing as sacrifice, only sacrifice has value—fear is just a tool of suicide—resistance is the condition for victory. This has been proved with iron evidence in the history of the world's nations and亡史, without any doubt. Today, when the National Spiritual Mobilization is beginning to be implemented, the psychology of fear and cowardice should be completely eliminated, and the spirit of fearlessness should be further promoted and carried forward.</p>
<p>Promote National Spirit</p>
<p>During the period of more than one year since the National Army withdrew westward, the patriotism of the Shanghai compatriots has been seen by the whole world. Although the power of the government is no longer sufficient, our compatriots have always obeyed the government's laws and respected the government's intentions without interruption. This great and noble national spirit is admired by both China and foreign countries. We hope that compatriots throughout the city will further promote and carry forward this national spirit in the future. If anyone uses special forces to violate the law and disrupt order, we will concentrate all revolutionary forces to give them the most severe sanctions, so that no slightest stain will be left in this great and glorious history of resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<p>Temper National Integrity</p>
<p>In the history books of our country, which has been established for more than 5,000 years, whenever the country encounters the most difficult times, the boundless and uninterrupted national integrity must be further promoted and carried forward. During this war of resistance, the facts that can be sung and cried about, whether in cities or towns, are constantly reported. This is the most obvious evidence. Compatriots throughout the city should maintain and promote this national integrity, and everyone should have the determination to "rather starve to death than disgrace the country." They would rather sacrifice themselves than tarnish the country. [Japanese Hidden], the [Japanese], will eventually succumb to our national integrity, which is supremely strong and great!</p>
<p>The above six matters are what this association sincerely tells all compatriots in the city. It is hoped that our people will deeply understand them, strive to practice them, and the completion of the great cause of the war of resistance is based on this—Headquarters of the Shanghai All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Status Quo in the Mediterranean and Balkans Should Not Be Disturbed; British Prime Minister Clarifies His Determination to Resist Aggression, Provides Concrete Guarantees to Greece and Romania <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, after explaining the British government's view on Italy's seizure of Albania in the House of Commons this afternoon, said: "The British Imperial Government deeply feels the responsibility and obligation to clarify its position and clear up external doubts about Britain. I take this opportunity to declare that the British Imperial Government is determined to prevent, with its utmost efforts, any attempt to disrupt the "status quo" in the Mediterranean or the Balkan Peninsula by threat or force. Therefore, any action that clearly threatens the independence of Greece or Romania, and at the same time, the governments of Greece and Romania believe that they must use their national power to resist, will be regarded by the Imperial Government as having a mutual assistance pact with Greece and Romania, and will spare no effort. We have notified each country concerned and other countries of this declaration. I know that the French government is also drafting a similar declaration. Regarding all changes and developments, the governments of all autonomous territories have also been notified as usual. I only want to add one or two points about what I have observed. As far as I am concerned, I would like to state that no extremely emotional event has occurred to date that is sufficient to change my judgment and believe that the Anglo-Italian agreement signed by the Imperial Government a year ago is an unsuitable policy. I make this statement to avoid any misunderstanding of my current attitude, not to provoke debate. I can frankly admit that I am undoubtedly deeply disappointed with the Italian government's actions this time. Many people in the country believe that the Anglo-Italian agreement should now be terminated. However, I really cannot agree with this observation, because anyone who claims to be responsible will never want to take hasty action in the current situation, which will increase the tension in the international situation. Therefore, I deeply believe that the people of the country must hope that the agreement can be effectively fulfilled. In view of all the recent changes, we should first look at whether the Italian government can provide concrete evidence to show that it also has the same wishes. Regarding Italy's withdrawal of its volunteer soldiers stationed in the west, the British government has repeatedly agreed to Italy's request. In the exchange of official letters, the Italian side notified the British government that as soon as the victory parade in Madrid was over, it would withdraw Italian volunteer soldiers. The government has paid considerable attention to this new guarantee from Italy, because the government has always believed that the withdrawal of Italian volunteer soldiers is an important element of the Anglo-Italian agreement. We have been patiently waiting for a long time. Although we often encounter various obstacles and disturbances in our efforts to eliminate suspicion and promote friendship, we have always endured it. I really do not want to believe that such painstaking efforts have no effect at all. I also hope that all members of parliament will not think that my government has not continued to contact the Soviet Union just because I have not mentioned the Soviet Union. There are extremely difficult things that need to be solved by us at present. Therefore, we should not only take care of our own expectations, but also consider what others are willing to do. I ask the entire House to put aside prejudices, remove preconceived notions, and deeply believe that the government has made its utmost efforts to call on all those who still advocate peace to unite. Today, what I mean by saying that we should show a firm resolve is not only to strengthen ourselves and defend ourselves, but also to fulfill our responsibilities and stand on the same front with all countries that have been subjected to aggression or threatened with the loss of freedom and are determined to resist." Foreign Minister Halifax also issued a similar statement in the House of Lords.</p>
<h3 id="e20">British Parliamentarians Advocate Cooperation with the Soviet Union; German and Italian Reactions Show No Regret; Romania is Gratified and the People are Encouraged <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Liberal Party leader Sinclair said at a meeting of the House of Commons today, referring to the Albania incident, "This blatant act of aggression has torn the last shred of the compromise policy to pieces. This act violates the Anglo-Italian agreement and the gentleman's agreement on which it is based." He also declared, "We have encountered the conspiracy of the Axis powers." Sinclair then demanded that the government quickly establish a supply department, and continued, "Let us prepare first to prove our determination, and then unite the threatened countries to go to our common purpose." Sinclair strongly advocated the need for Britain to maintain friendship with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] After Chamberlain issued a declaration in the House of Commons today, opposition Labor Party leader Attlee expressed disappointment, stating that since Italy has broken the agreement, the Anglo-Italian agreement has lost its value in maintaining peace. It is gratifying that the British government has given guarantees to the countries of Poland, Greece, and Romania, but it is not thorough. In short, universal guarantees should be made based on the League of Nations Covenant to seek collective security. If collective security is to be established today, it is impossible without the integration of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons today on his views on the status of the Mediterranean, agreeing with the government that it would not be beneficial to refute the Anglo-Italian agreement at present. He criticized the British fleet for spreading across the Mediterranean during Easter, saying, "If the British fleet is concentrated in the Ionian Sea and engaged in patrols, I believe Italy will not make an adventurous aggression against Albania. Now is not the time to take a no-bottom approach. If we want to preserve peace, we must immediately take two steps: one is to invite the Soviet Union to participate in peace talks, and the other is the unity of the Balkans. If the four Balkan countries can unite consistently and resolutely, they can obtain security. I do not believe that Italy has determined to fight a decisive battle with Britain and France." Labor Party member Dalton strongly advocated that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude a military alliance, as well as against aggression in Europe, Asia, or North Africa. Finance Minister Simon replied that the British government has no intention of rejecting the Soviet Union or not wanting the Soviet Union to participate in peace work. The debate then ended, and the House of Commons decided to reopen on Tuesday next week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Today, British Foreign Minister Halifax said in the House of Lords that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had notified British Ambassador to Italy, Pens, on the 9th of this month that after the Italian army withdrew from Spain, Italian aircraft and pilots would also be withdrawn. Members of the House of Lords, Snall and Marquis of Lothian, representing the Labor Party and the Liberal Party respectively, strongly stated that forming an alliance with the Soviet Union was absolutely important.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The initial reactions in Rome and Berlin to Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday were that the attitude of Germany and Italy, the Axis powers, was firm and showed no regret. The people of the Romanian capital were extremely encouraged. Officials were comforted by the fact that Britain had guaranteed [Romania's] security. The Hungarian capital still believes that the international crisis is fraught with dangers. The problem thereafter still lies in the future actions of the Axis powers. German officials said that they would not criticize it temporarily until the full text had been studied, but they continued to attack Britain. Italian officials said leniently that Chamberlain's speech had admitted that the Albania incident, if "interpreted properly," had not damaged the Anglo-Italian agreement and the status quo in the Mediterranean. It is questionable that the British Prime Minister's declaration stated that the Adriatic Sea is part of the Mediterranean Sea. At the same time, there are doubts about whether Britain has the ability to ensure the safety of Romania, Greece, and Poland, saying that Italy has already made a commitment to Greece, so Britain's guarantees to other countries are superfluous. As for the British House of Commons, everyone welcomed Chamberlain's speech. Supporters of the government believed that the future still depends on the attitude and actions of other countries, so the Prime Minister's mission is extremely difficult. They welcomed the Prime Minister's guarantees to Romania and Greece, but believed that they had not been thorough enough. They hoped that there could be more detailed reports on relations with the Soviet Union. If the two countries could establish a concrete agreement, it would be of great benefit to the current international situation.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] French Prime Minister Daladier, on behalf of the French government, made the same declaration as British Prime Minister Chamberlain on behalf of the British government. The French Prime Minister said that the purpose of the government's policy has been discussed in his broadcast speech on March 29. Since then, France has buried itself in hard work, not focusing on empty words or taking actions of no value. The country has implemented military measures, which are sufficient to guarantee the security of France and the territory of the French Empire, and are powerful enough to cope with any foreign aggression. The French government has been constantly maintaining permanent close contact with the governments of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Balkan countries. He believes that the purpose of these governments is to seek cooperation between countries and not to threaten the survival interests of anyone, but to resolutely resist all monopolistic ambitions. He will be able to achieve this. The French Prime Minister also said that the deep understanding between Britain and France has produced a force that has never existed before. Finally, Daladier read his declaration supporting the joint assistance of Britain and France to Greece and Romania.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Cabinet Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier gave a broadcast speech to the people on the afternoon of the 13th, stating that the French government has taken military measures to defend the borders of the mainland and colonies in order to respond to all contingencies. The conscripts of all levels of reservists who were called up were able to enthusiastically join the army, which is commendable. Regarding France's position on the current international situation, I have explained it on March 29. In short, at a time when the European situation is unstable, France is determined to maintain peace within the scope of freedom and honor. The first step is to strengthen national defense and to strengthen the ties with the nations who are determined to resist aggression and maintain freedom. In particular, we should maintain constant contact with the governments of Britain, the United States, Soviet Russia, Poland, and the Balkan Agreement countries, namely Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The goal we are aiming for is to form the necessary cooperation between the nations who have no intention of threatening the vital interests of other countries, who are determined to resist various aggressive attempts, and who are willing to discuss the current issues openly and honestly, and we firmly believe that this goal can be achieved. As for the mutual understanding between Britain and France, it has never been so close and solid. I am now speaking to the people with the prior consent of the governments of Britain and France. At this point, Prime Minister Daladier said that the French government had declared to Romania and Greece that if the sovereignty of these countries were threatened, it would assist them with all its strength. The British and Polish governments have accepted mutual constraints, declaring that they will assist each other when they encounter direct or indirect threats in order to defend their independence and sovereignty. The French government is very pleased to hear about this. The existing alliance treaty between France and Poland has also been reaffirmed in the same spirit. When the vital interests of both countries are directly or indirectly threatened, they should immediately rise up to help each other. This approach should be notified to the governments of all relevant countries, especially the Turkish government. In short, maintaining territorial integrity and the security of the colonial empire in order to respond to various direct and indirect threats is the right of France. The government is aware of the great responsibility of implementing this policy and will complete the country's destiny with a firm will and a loyal and守的 determination.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Charlottesville, 13th] US Under Secretary of State Welles, speaking at the University of Virginia's Founder's Day celebration today, strongly criticized "a few malicious elements" threatening world peace and called on the United States to sell all necessary goods to peace-loving nations to prevent their conquest.

<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] A "News Chronicle" correspondent in Warsaw reports that the German government has notified Lithuania that the recently signed Memel Convention needs a "new revision." Under the provisions of this new revision, Lithuania cannot obtain the promised free zone in Memel, nor can it build ports on the Baltic Sea. All Lithuanian trade must go through Memel. This demand is considered a warning to Lithuania and also indicates Germany's new aggressive intentions towards Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. Poland's main interests are in the Baltic Sea, and it is believed here that if Germany further aggresses against Lithuania or other countries in the Baltic region, Poland will not be able to continue to remain silent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] "The Daily Herald" today carries a report from Warsaw stating that Lithuania recently uncovered a conspiracy to incorporate Lithuania into Germany. Major arrests were made in the Lithuanian capital. Army Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis personally arrested Colonel Balušis, who was pro-German.

The conspirators attempted to seize government power and then sign a commercial agreement with Germany, completely reducing Lithuania to a political and economic dependency of Germany.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e29">British, American, and French Declarations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>After Italy's occupation of Albania, the remaining five Balkan countries feel the pain of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold." Seeing the "collusion" between Italian and German aggressors, the whole of Europe is already facing a greater crisis, and even the Latin American crisis has suddenly become serious due to the rampant actions of the Italian and German aggressors. This new situation certainly makes some small and weak countries feel the pain of "national demise is imminent," but the British, French, and American countries are also worried about the fate of their countries and world peace.</p>
<p>Under the threat of this objective environment, the British, French, and American countries cannot but move towards uniting democratic and peace-loving countries to jointly resist fascist aggressors. The Soviet Union's peace policy has thus begun to be trusted and expected by all parties. According to reports in the past two days, British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared on the afternoon of the 13th that he would guarantee Greece and Romania, and French Prime Minister Daladier also issued the same declaration on behalf of the government that evening. And US President Roosevelt also broadcast to the country on the afternoon of the 14th, issuing a warning against the totalitarian countries invading Latin America. From this, it can be seen that democratic and peace-loving countries can only be forced to expand the peace front and resist the future of fascist aggressors.</p>
<p>However, this kind of declaration by Britain and France is still a one-sided, temporary, and very weak official statement, and the American anti-aggression movement has not yet developed to the necessary extent to combat aggression. There is no doubt that this declaration and expression cannot truly prevent aggression and prevent war. Yesterday, Reuters London also reported that Rome and Berlin are still tough after Chamberlain's declaration was issued on the 13th. As British Labour Party leader Attlee said: "We need a real guarantee policy, we need to establish a permanent collective security architecture, not just a policy that only seeks peace for a week or half a month. If we want to avoid war, we must have enough strength to deter all aggression, therefore, when we have not heard the status of the Soviet Union being mentioned, we cannot help but express special regret!"</p>
<h3 id="e30">German Naval Exercises to Be Held off the Coast of Spain; British Naval Circles Closely Monitor <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] It is reported that the German government has notified the governments of Britain and France that, as usual, the German fleet's spring maneuvers this year will be held off the coast of Spain for about a month. The ships participating in the exercise are scheduled to depart from various German ports on April 18th. Among them are three "Deutschland" class pocket battleships, three cruisers, and a fleet of destroyers, submarines, and other auxiliary ships.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The German government has recently decided to dispatch a naval fleet, including six cruisers, three of which belong to the Deutschland-class, all 10,000-ton pocket battleships, and several submarines, to Spanish territorial waters for a period of one month. According to informed sources, the warships are scheduled to depart from Wilhelmshaven Port this evening, will conduct exercises in Spanish waters, and may anchor in Spanish ports or be inspected by General Franco.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Official sources have recently announced that the German government has notified the governments of Britain and France that the German Navy's spring exercises this year will be held in Spanish waters for a period of one month. Naval circles here commented that at this time of the development of the European situation, this move by Germany has significant political or military significance. Recently, rumors have spread that when Spain joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, an annex was signed allowing Germany to use Spanish naval bases. Judging from this matter, it seems to reveal something and should be closely monitored. As for the defense of British Gibraltar, the government has recently taken special technical measures to renovate and strengthen it, making it exceptionally solid, and we are not afraid of attacks from the sea or from land.</p>
<p>Spain Will Again Become the Center of Events</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Political figures here recently stated that at this time, Spain has the possibility of becoming the center of international events again, which is particularly worrying. Although the Italian government has provided assurances to Britain, declaring its willingness to withdraw volunteer soldiers from Spain as soon as possible, the information received here is the opposite. For example, the Spanish National Army government is taking military measures near British Gibraltar and in Spanish Morocco, firstly; one-third of the German fleet is sailing to Spanish waters, secondly; German newspapers are suddenly advocating that Spain's position is very important, thirdly; foreign troops and arms are continuously being transported to the port of Cadiz in southern Spain, fourthly. Although this is denied daily by the Spanish National Army government, the news that comes contradicts this announcement. Since the National Army government joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, German newspapers have taken the opportunity to exaggerate Spain's wishes. According to one view, the Spanish side's various attitudes recently are a response from a certain country to Britain and France's guarantee of the security of Greece and Romania. The purpose is to plan ahead and seek a base during wartime. Britain and France should pay close attention.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, British Gibraltar, 13th] The port of La Línea de la Concepción in Spain (adjacent to Gibraltar) has been under strict guard for several days, and a large number of military supplies have been transported from the port of Cadiz, including field guns, machine guns, tanks, bullets, and gunpowder. Two to three thousand National Army troops have been arriving there since the 11th. In addition, many large transport ships have recently been traveling between the ports of Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco in North Africa and the port of Almería in southern Spain.</p>
<p>Gibraltar Hastens Construction of Fortifications</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, British Gibraltar, 13th] After the Spanish National Army government concentrated troops in the area adjacent to this port, the military authorities here have also taken appropriate preventive measures for vigilance. Two hundred engineers have been rushing to build solid obstacles on the road 200 meters from the border between Britain and Spain for days. La Línea de la Concepción in Spain has reportedly ordered the requisition of all types of vehicles in the city.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Malta, 13th] All personnel of the British Navy fleet here have been ordered to return to their ships by midnight on Thursday. The transport ship "Nivana" arrived here on Thursday evening, carrying 500 soldiers for reinforcement.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] France has recently taken military precautions on the Pyrenees border to cope with the increase in Franco's troops.</p>
<p>Danzig Germans Prepare for Reckless Action</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 14th] In the past twenty-four hours, the European situation has become more tense. Wartime preparations in various countries are accelerating. Anti-French demonstrations have erupted in Italy, with crowds shouting "March on Paris." Relations between Romania and Hungary are deteriorating, and both sides are concentrating troops on the border. According to reports, Germany and Italy have concentrated troops on the border of Yugoslavia. The current city in crisis is still Danzig. Germany has launched large-scale demonstrations there, as it did before in the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, and Memel. Next week is Hitler's 50th birthday, and it is generally believed that the day will mark the start of the European crisis. However, the Germans are preparing to hold fierce demonstrations on that day to celebrate his birthday. They plan to demand the cancellation of the League of Nations commissioner in Danzig and establish close ties between Danzig and Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] France is paying close attention to reports that German and Italian troops are concentrated on the Yugoslav border, as Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are important points in the British and French anti-aggression lines. At the same time, France is also very concerned about Britain's failure to obtain the Soviet Union's participation in anti-aggression work. However, reports say that Britain is considering taking military action with the Soviet Union alone.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Conspiracy to Seize Far East Shipping; Competition Among Various Countries Sharply Intensifies; British, American, French, and Dutch Shipping Companies Greatly Increase Ships Sailing to the Far East; Competing to Purchase Chinese Ships to Expand Routes <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Since the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan began, the coast and rivers have been filled with smoke and fire, and Japanese warships have roamed freely, violently blockading everything. As a result, Chinese state-owned and private ships have been forced to cease operations, and the Chinese shipping industry has disintegrated due to Japanese oppression. Under these extraordinary circumstances, Japanese shipping companies are taking advantage of the expansion of their military influence to seize the entire Chinese coastline and river shipping rights, manipulating and monopolizing them, and further controlling the entire Far East Pacific shipping industry. European and American shipping companies have risen up to compete with Japanese companies, taking the opportunity to greatly expand Far East routes, adding many ships to sail on Far East routes, competing through business operations, and at the same time, mutually purchasing Chinese state-owned and private shipping company ships, changing their names, and joining various routes. This situation has evolved to an extremely sharp point today.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Strongly Urge the Opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters investigated with relevant parties in Hong Kong and China. It is said that Britain, the United States, and France have greater rights and interests in the Far East shipping industry, especially in the Chinese rivers and inland waterways, than any other European and American countries. Since the war has spread to the Yangtze and Pearl River basins, the Japanese, in order to realize their monopoly and seizure conspiracy, have illegally blockaded them under the pretext of the existence of a dangerous military situation, refusing ships from various countries to sail. The losses suffered by the United States and France in business are difficult to estimate, and the indirect impact on the sales of goods from various countries in China is not insignificant. The governments of Britain, the United States, and France, finding it difficult to obtain any results through normal diplomatic channels, have decided to contact the relevant European and American countries to take a firm stance to negotiate with Japan for the opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers and the waterways of the occupied guerrilla areas, to restore the normal state before the "July 7th" Incident, so that ships from various countries can sail as usual according to treaties. Otherwise, they will unanimously take retaliatory actions in the economic field to put pressure on Japan, in order to achieve this legitimate goal of maintaining rights and interests.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies from Various Countries Increase Ships Sailing to the Far East</p>
<p>At the same time, people in shipping companies from various countries, in the current special situation, in order to enhance the maintenance of their position and rights in the Far East, must quickly expand their Far East shipping industry, so as not to fall behind and weaken the Chinese goods market. Therefore, they are all paying special attention to the expansion of the Far East shipping industry. The main countries in the Far East shipping industry, in addition to Britain, the United States, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Germany, also include more than a dozen second-tier countries such as Panama, Portugal, Norway, Greece, and Sweden, which also have considerable ships sailing to the Far East. Now, the competition among various countries for Far East shipping is becoming increasingly fierce, and they are all engaged in self-expansion. The governments of various countries are taking advantage of the opportunity to subsidize their shipping companies, increasing the construction of improved large and small ships to join the Far East sailing. British companies such as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O), Taikoo, China Navigation Company, and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. are all increasing fast ships sailing on the routes along the Indian Ocean and the Pacific coast, as well as Chinese inland rivers and coastal areas, increasing the frequency of voyages to various ports. American postal shipping companies, such as Dollar Steamship Lines, have successively resumed the sailing of their President liners, which have been suspended for a long time, directly to the ports of Shanghai and other ports in the Far East via the Pacific Ocean, and at the same time, they have reduced passenger fares and improved all supplies for passengers on the ships. French, German, Italian, and other postal shipping companies are also eagerly planning to develop their Far East route businesses. Shipping companies in Portugal, the Netherlands, Panama, the Soviet Union, Norway, and other countries are also taking the same steps. The Swedish East Asiatic Company recently added five new-style electric cargo ships to the Far East routes. The construction of the first ship, the "Kinnaird," has been completed, and the second sister ship will be launched this summer. The remaining three ships will be completed in 1940 and will come to the Far East after completion.</p>
<p>Competing to Purchase Chinese Ships to Expand the Far East Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Among the shipping companies from various countries that are actively expanding the Far East shipping industry, increasing the construction of new ships is certainly being accelerated, but in terms of time, it is not as easy to develop and achieve practical results as purchasing Chinese state-owned and private ships. Therefore, after the suspension of operations of Chinese ships, shipping companies from various countries have started to compete to purchase them. According to accurate reports from the Hong Kong and China shipping industry, apart from the four newly built ships of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, "Yuan," "Xiang," "Li," and "Zhen," which have been sold to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., the "Haixiang," "Hairui," and various river ships are all in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The "Xinming," "Taishun," "Xinjiangtian," "Tonghua," "Xinfeng," and other seagoing ships have all been sunk to serve as blockade lines. The private Sanbei ships have been sold to the Italian-Chinese Company, and the "Dada" and "Datong" ships are all moored in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The "Luxing," "Zhoushan," "Taizhou," and "Ping'an" ships have been sold to Portuguese merchants, and the "Hefeng" and other ships have been sold to American merchants. The "Huashang" and other ships have been sold to Panamanian merchants, and the "Ningshao" and other ships have been sold to German merchants. Those sunk to serve as blockade lines include the "Huaping" and "Taiping" ships. After British, American, German, Portuguese, Greek, and Panamanian shipping companies purchased Chinese ships, they have been working hard to expand coastal and downstream routes in China to compete with Japanese shipping companies. Newly organized foreign shipping companies after the war, such as the Italian-Chinese Company, the American-owned Wilhailm, Huamei, the Portuguese-owned Zhengde, Meili, the German-owned Far East, and the German-owned Lihe, Lulin, and the Norwegian-owned Hualun, are all operating shipping businesses. The Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, the Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou in Fujian, as well as the Shanghai-Chongming, coastal routes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Shanghai-Tongyang route, and the North and South Ocean routes, are all being operated by ships dispatched by foreign shipping companies.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Eager to Deduct Monopoly Shipping Rights</p>
<p>Under the active development of the Far East shipping industry by shipping companies from various countries, what deserves our attention is that Japanese are taking the opportunity to manipulate and monopolize Far East shipping rights, placing them under their sphere of influence control, and fulfilling their dream of domination. In particular, they are targeting our coastal and inland river shipping rights. When the Yangtze River War extended to Wuhan, the Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha obtained subsidies from the Japanese government to control the Yangtze River and the small ships in the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After looting our shipping merchants' ships, Chongming, Xinhongxing, and Tianci, they renamed them and monopolized the Shanghai-Chongming and Shanghai-Tong routes. Their shipping companies alone dispatched ships to travel in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast of Guangdong, preventing the opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Now, they are expanding from the Chinese coast to routes directly to Southeast Asia, from Tianjin, Shanghai, and Xiamen to Singapore and Siam via Hong Kong. At the same time, in order to facilitate their manipulation and monopoly of shipping rights, they are arbitrarily detaining foreign ships under the pretext of investigating nationality. According to sources in the Hong Kong shipping industry, in addition to the foreign ships currently detained in the Provincial River, more than 20 ships belonging to Britain, France, Portugal, Panama, and other countries have been illegally detained, with the most being Portuguese-registered, accounting for about 12 or 13. About 6 or 7 Panamanian-registered ships have also been detained. The intention of the Japanese is nothing more than to hinder the development of the Far East shipping industry in various countries and to fulfill their conspiracy to manipulate and monopolize it.</p>

<p>A bizarre case of three thieves stealing valuable jewelry occurred at the Hutcheon Jewelry Company on Pedder Street the day before yesterday. On the afternoon of the 13th, three Shanghai men, all well-dressed, went to the company claiming to buy a pocket watch. After discussing the price for a long time, they left without making a purchase. When discussing the price, the three men had no other suspicious movements. After the three men left, it was discovered that three diamond rings were missing, one valued at $3,840, one valued at $1,840, and one valued at $800, for a total value of $6,480. People in the company considered this case to be bizarre and had no idea how the theft occurred, so they went to the Chinese Police Station yesterday morning to report the case. It is said that the authorities are paying close attention to this bizarre case and are currently conducting a thorough investigation. Also, the Xu residence on Glass Street in Causeway Bay went to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station yesterday morning to report that a gold bracelet and a gold necklace, worth more than $500 in total, had been stolen within 12 hours. The duty officer took the report, recorded it, and sent detectives to investigate. Due to the bizarre nature of the theft, it is suspected that a family thief is difficult to guard against. The workers in the residence were taken back to the police station for questioning to find out the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Although the Plague Has Passed, Ships from Shantou to Hong Kong Still Need to Enter Quarantine; Third-Class Passengers Still Not Allowed to Land Freely; No Results from Requests by Chaozhou and Jiaying Chambers of Commerce <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong health authorities, due to the plague that occurred in Shantou this year, announced the port as a plague-affected port. All ships coming to Hong Kong from Shantou must enter quarantine, and passengers, except for those in first and second class, are not allowed to land freely. This has not changed to this day. The Hong Kong Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce and the Jiaying Chamber of Commerce believe that this type of inspection procedure is time-consuming and has a great impact on Hong Kong-Shantou trade. Some days ago, they jointly submitted a petition to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, requesting the restoration of free landing for passengers. At the same time, the chairmen of the two chambers of commerce also personally visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs to make an effective request, requesting that he forward the matter to the health officer for consideration. However, the two chambers of commerce received a reply from the medical officer yesterday, which was not granted. According to Li Zifeng, chairman of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, the medical officer's reply still does not allow passengers to land freely, and the reason given is that this matter should be handled with caution and should not be done carelessly. Originally, in the current South China War, Hong Kong-Shantou transportation is even more important, so the number of merchants traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou has also increased compared to before. If this continues, it will greatly affect Hong Kong-Shantou trade.</p>

<p>Since the reconstruction of the Central Market, the original meat, duck stalls, fruit stands, and vegetable stalls have been ordered to relocate. As a result, meat companies, fruit shops, and vegetable stores are ubiquitous in the Central district. However, some speculative hawkers believe that due to the market's dispersion, those who purchase meals in the morning and evening cannot concentrate their purchases in one place, which is inconvenient. Therefore, they carry shoulder poles and baskets, wandering around the Central Market and its vicinity, soliciting purchases. The police authorities consider this a violation, so they have dispatched prison vans to park in front of the market for days. As soon as they encounter such meat hawkers, they are arrested. Yesterday morning, a man carrying a bamboo basket containing dozens of fresh fish covered with a dirty white cloth whispered to potential customers. The police, seeing this, suddenly surprised him from behind and sent him to the prison van. Other vegetable hawkers displaying their goods on the side streets, fearing arrest, scattered in panic, creating chaos. Pedestrians were alarmed, as if a major disaster had occurred. As a result, the police searched and arrested several people, taking them back to the Central Police Station for prosecution.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Air Defense Committee recently ordered several new types of air raid sirens from England, which arrived in Hong Kong and were installed in various districts. The air defense authorities scheduled the first test for yesterday at 2:15 PM. The first siren lasted three minutes, indicating that enemy planes would invade Hong Kong within a few minutes. At 2:25 PM, the test continued with a long siren, also lasting three minutes, indicating that the air raid danger had passed. The test sites included the Central, Peak, Causeway Bay, and Sheung Wan police stations. The sirens sounded loudly, and the results were satisfactory. The air defense authorities plan to hold a third blackout drill in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Countless Incidents - Pirates Run Rampant in Hong Kong Waters - Passenger and Cargo Boats Hijacked - Total Loss of Goods Exceeds Two Thousand Dollars <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Piracy runs rampant in Hong Kong's territorial waters, and incidents of murder and robbery occur frequently. The previous day, cargo boats were hijacked successively in the waters off Kau Yi Chau and Deep Water Bay, resulting in losses of several thousand dollars. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo Boat</p>
<p>Lin Rong, 33, a native of Lufeng and the owner of cargo boat 1511V, loaded 350 cans of wood oil from Lufeng to Hong Kong on the tenth of this month, to be delivered to Yang Shengxiang Company on Wing Sing Street. At 1:00 PM on the thirteenth, when the boat arrived in the waters off Kau Yi Chau, it encountered a fishing boat carrying several pirates who fired shots into the air as a warning and ordered them to stop. The pirates then boarded the boat, threatened the crew, drove them into the hold, and nailed the hatch shut. They then moved the wood oil to their boat and fled. After the pirates left, Lin and the others managed to open the hatch and sailed back to Hong Kong, arriving yesterday afternoon and reporting the incident to the police station. The total loss from the robbery amounted to two thousand three hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Passenger Boat</p>
<p>Mai Fa, 51, a farmer from the New Territories, reported to the police station yesterday morning that at 3:00 PM the previous afternoon, he was returning to Yuen Long from Bao'an on an unidentified small boat with 21 passengers and about four or five crew members. When they arrived in the waters off Deep Bay, they were suddenly confronted by a pirate boat carrying six or seven bandits, most of whom were armed with pistols. They fired several shots into the air as a warning and ordered them to stop. Under threat, the boat complied. The four armed pirates immediately boarded, threatened them, pushed them into the hold, and searched them one by one, robbing him of forty-three Hong Kong dollars and five chickens. The losses of other passengers were not detailed. After looting, the pirates returned to their boat and fled towards Tai O. He requested that the case be filed and investigated.</p>

<p>The Central Market, which has been under construction for three years, has recently been completed and is scheduled to open on May 1. The health authorities have issued a notice that the stalls in the market will be auctioned off on a fixed date, but attempts by monopolists to bid for all the stalls and profit from them are strictly prohibited. Successful bidders must operate the stalls themselves and are not allowed to sublet them for profit. Violators will have their rights revoked and may be severely punished. If the stalls fall into the hands of monopolists, they will be sublet repeatedly, driving up rental prices and affecting the market prices of goods. When the reporter asked Mr. Todd, Chairman of the Municipal Health Bureau, about this issue yesterday, he said that the authorities absolutely prohibit the practice of bidding for all the stalls and will impose severe penalties if discovered. However, Mr. Todd declined to disclose what steps the government will take to prevent subletting.</p>

<p>The overseas Chinese in Victoria, Canada, have organizations such as the Anti-Japanese Association, which raises funds for national salvation bonds and other national salvation activities. Their past donations and bond drives have been remarkable. Recently, with our generals gathering and the Guangdong army approaching, the recovery of the provincial capital is imminent. They have specially organized a "Fundraising Sub-Committee for Aiding Wounded Soldiers and Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi" to raise funds for relief. The first fundraising theatrical performance of the committee was quite effective. Yesterday, they remitted over three thousand Hong Kong dollars to the Guangxi Bank in Hong Kong, entrusting the bank to forward it to General Li Baier of the Fifth Route Army for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi. It is reported that the committee will continue to raise funds for continuous assistance.</p>

<p>Flowers have fallen, but flowers will bloom again. My sister, you are still young, don't lament the fading of the flowers. People say that flowers that fall and bloom again won't be as radiant. I think that blooming after withering will make them even more beautiful. Without the pressure of snow and frost, even the most beautiful flowers have limitations. Don't fear the mad bees and butterflies; why rely on a protective banner? Seeing the bright spring, the flowers may not have eyes. But when the flowers fall, the spring scenery is desolate. The tide will also turn; you've seen flowers bloom and fall often. Speaking of the cycle of nature, human affairs are always involved. When human affairs reach their limit, rely on heaven for judgment. When the masses work together, we can break through this difficult situation. Four hundred million hearts united, people will be wary. Even if the country is lost, the pearl will be returned to Hepu soon. Ah, don't stumble, don't believe you can't row upstream and reach the shore.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Hearing About Going Dancing <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Ah Xiang</p>
<p>Hearing about going dancing, I change clothes before dark. With someone to accompany me, I'm not afraid to dance until dawn. Like butterflies, fluttering unrestrainedly through the flowers. If you don't spin like a windmill, how can you keep up with the soothing music? Four big thighs close together, not afraid of leaning.</p>
<p>High heels clatter against the slippery floor, ah, you must be careful. Dancing is so trendy these days, it's not just in hotel halls. If you mention a lively place, there's always a dance hall. During this time of national crisis, you are not cheerful, nor do you seem right. Like cold-blooded animals, a pair of lovebirds fly out. It's not just moralistic gentlemen who refuse to look at you. Even foreigners who see you, while they might not call you useless, will laugh at them for being heartless. Why not donate the money spent on soda and ice cream to set up a porridge kitchen, so that tens of millions of displaced compatriots don't have to eat old bran.</p>
<p>Moreover, the government's prohibitions are so strict, you should think about them. Even if you don't want to cultivate virtue, don't lose all conscience. China has never fought such a tragic war in thousands of years. Look at how many cities in the eighteen provinces are not occupied. Ah, I can't bear to say more. In short, I advise you to kindly refrain from dancing, ladies.</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e43">Symbolizing the Rebirth of the Chinese Nation: A Young National Warrior: Fan Zheng - A Great Era Trains Such an Outstanding Child <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Before the development of psychology, it was impossible to understand extraordinary child prodigies, so they were simply called "geniuses."</p>
<p>Genius is only a kind of "moldability"; after socialized collective life replaces the monotonous life of individualism, it is easier to explain that "era" and "environment" are important factors in promoting the development of genius. The Fan Zheng we are reporting on is such a child.</p>
<p>He is a thirteen-year-old boy whose hometown is Jilin in the lost Northeast. He is handsome and intelligent, and speaks fluent Northern Mandarin.</p>
<p>His family is a large family of "scholarly lineage," most of whom are intellectuals. When he was eight years old, his father went to Henan to teach, and he followed him to study at the Rotary Elementary School in Henan. After a year or so, he followed his father back to Peiping and studied at the Peiping Normal University Affiliated Elementary School. Because the teachers were not resisting Japan, he and several other children left the school, sacrificing the elementary school diploma he could have obtained. This was during the winter vacation of the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), and he and his comrades edited the "Children's Life" weekly in the Peiping New News, which was also a garden for their spirit and vitality.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the New An Traveling Troupe went north from Shanghai to comfort the troops in Suiyuan and passed through Peiping. Their "Children's Life" published a welcome special page, and they met the New An Traveling Troupe. As they lived together, they became closer and closer. In March of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937), Fan Zheng officially joined the New An Traveling Troupe, the only children's group in the country. His enlightened father allowed his request. His loving mother was a little worried. "I'll be back in a few months," he firmly coaxed his mother, and from then on, he received the baptism of life education and embarked on a great journey.</p>
<p>From Peiping to Suiyuan, and from Suiyuan to Ningxia, most of the journey was traveled on his own "two-wheeled vehicle." Just as they stepped into Ningxia, the sound of the guns of the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident) rang out. The "study" and "work" of their New An Traveling Troupe became more active and tense to meet the needs of the war of resistance. From Ningxia to Gansu, to Shaanxi, to Henan, all the way to participating in the work of defending Greater Wuhan. Under the appointment of the Political Department, the work unfolded more smoothly, becoming a heat wave in the national salvation movement, a bright page in the history of children's movement.</p>
<p>They worked in Wuhan for three months, until the day Guangzhou fell, a few days before the evacuation of Wuhan and Macau, they left Wuhan and went to Guilin to work. Because the China National Salvation Drama Troupe needed the New An Traveling Troupe to send a child to participate in overseas work, Fan Zheng was nominated by his comrades to join the China National Salvation Drama Troupe. He departed from Guilin with the troupe, passed through Shaoguan and Shantou, and arrived in Hong Kong. Fan Zheng told the reporter this little history himself. He is truly a capable young national warrior.</p>
<p>The reporter met this lovely child when he attended the commemorative meeting with him on Children's Day. He had an article "How to Spend This Year's Children's Day" published in this newspaper, which was also well-written. The more I talked to him, the more I discovered his rich experience. When he saw the special feature "Introducing the Children's Friend of Shen Bao," he immediately said, "I've already read the Children's Friend." When talking about Mr. Tao Xingzhi, he said, "Our teacher is Mr. Tao's student, so I propose to call Mr. Tao 'Grand Teacher.'" He is really good—when talking about singing, he said, "I have collected many children's national salvation songs and plan to compile them into a single book so that children in Hong Kong and Nanyang can sing them"! A thirteen-year-old child has the grand ambition of compiling a song collection, which is truly "a young man is to be feared."</p>
<p>But the training of life made his answers "precocious." When asked about his past experiences, he described how Wang Jingwei gave a speech in Suiyuan saying, "We have reached the final juncture..." and then criticized him for becoming a traitor.</p>
<p>He talked with great enthusiasm about how Chairman Chiang smiled at them when he inspected the National Salvation Work Team on Double Ten Day, how Mr. Guo Ruomo lectured them, how Mr. Tao Xingzhi loved them, how interesting it was when they were together, and even criticized Mr. Tao's poems for being like Mr. Feng Yuxiang's... He talked about these things as if they were his own treasures.</p>
<p>At a welcome meeting, when Mr. Jin Shan introduced him to Mr. Jin Zhonghua, he immediately said, "Ah! I saw your article and your map in some book." He could also accurately name the predecessor of the publication "Total War of Resistance" edited by Mr. Zou Taofen. At the welcome meeting of the Young Journalists Association, he reported his hopes of going abroad, and everyone praised the child's extraordinary qualities. He spoke skillfully and appropriately when asking the gentlemen to guide him—he was innocent and lively, winning everyone's applause.</p>
<p>The reporter asked him, "What work do you do in the China National Salvation Drama Troupe now?" "I do children's work. There are adults to do work for adults." How do you carry out the work? He talked about reporting on the situation of the children's movement, making children believe in themselves, and helping to organize... These were all based on his experience. In the troupe, his work was unique, even though he was a child.</p>
<p>A great era and a great environment have trained such an outstanding child, such a capable young warrior. This is precisely the symbol of the nation's rebirth and the country's bright future!</p>

<h3 id="e44">The Counterattack on Zengcheng Takes a Sudden Turn - Our Army Captures Zengcheng - We Have Crossed the Zeng River and Entered Shitan, Heading Straight for the City Walls - Enemy Surrounded on All Sides, Fights Like Cornered Beasts, Is Defeated <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Dongjiang Express News) The military progress of the Dongjiang counterattack is rapid, beyond the enemy's expectations. After surrounding Zengcheng and completing the inner line encirclement, we have begun attacking the city walls. News was reported yesterday. It is understood that our army's encirclement of Zengcheng is relentless, with morale soaring. Guangzhou's outer regiment of the enemy is significantly restrained by this route. The following are more detailed battle conditions obtained here:</p>
<p>Our Army Entered Zengcheng This Afternoon</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Wengyuan at 12:20 PM on the 14th: A phone call from the front reports that our troops counterattacking Zengcheng have entered Zengcheng. The enemy has only left a small force to defend the city streets, engaging in fierce street fighting with our advance plainclothes teams. A large fire has broken out in the prosperous areas of the city, with flames reaching the sky, visible from miles away.</p>
<p>Besieged City - Enemy Feels Isolated and Endangered</p>
<p>Our troops counterattacking Zengcheng this time are a joint force of the Ninth and Twelfth Army Groups. The eastern route is comprised of the Wei, Liu, and Chen units under the command of General Ou. The northern route is the Huang Liang division under the left wing of the Twelfth Army Group. Another route is the Chi Zhongkuan unit, commander of the Dongjiang south bank, which secretly crossed the Zeng River from Gouzaitan and infiltrated Shitan and Xiancun, cooperating with the Shan Rongpei unit. After recapturing Zhuguling, Shetouling, Jiaoshiguling, Pengwu, and other places on the morning of the 13th, the inner encirclement was completed. At 6:00 PM that afternoon, our army, using the dangerous barriers in the suburbs and the cover of new artillery, began attacking the city walls with mobile tactics. By the evening of the 13th and the morning of the 14th, our vanguard had reached the outside of the northeast gate. Zengcheng was besieged. The enemy troops inside the city felt isolated and endangered.</p>
<p>Several Breakout Attempts - All Defeated</p>
<p>According to the enemy inside the city, they were surrounded on all sides and extremely panicked. In order to escape, they stubbornly defended the city walls and fought like cornered beasts, using mechanized units and steel cannons as cover to break out of the northeast city gates, hoping to break our encirclement. Their attack was fierce, but our soldiers fought bravely, and our defense lines were strong. Although the enemy charged repeatedly, they were repeatedly repelled. Our defenders maintained their positions and fought calmly. This offensive and defensive war was extremely fierce, unprecedented on the eastern front. The number of enemy troops annihilated was also the largest in this battle. As of the morning of the 14th, over 400 enemy troops had been killed or wounded, three enemy tanks had been destroyed, and countless guns and ammunition had been captured.</p>
<p>Guangdong Enemy Reinforcements - Attempt to Lift the Siege</p>
<p>According to intelligence, Guangzhou's enemy commander Ando, after learning that our army had surrounded Zengcheng, sent a mixed force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery of 400 to 500 men, along with five tanks, on the night of the 13th, heading east along the suburbs to lift the siege of Zengcheng. On the morning of the 14th, they approached our army's警戒 line. Our army concentrated artillery fire to迎击 the attacking enemy. The enemy stubbornly defending the city also fired artillery in support, resulting in a fierce artillery battle. The sound of artillery fire could be heard from the 13th evening to the 14th morning in the areas of Jutou, Qishi, and Qiaotou along the Dongjiang River. The intensity of the battle can be imagined. Furthermore, villagers from Huatouling, Huixi, and other places in the suburbs of Zengcheng, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, fled east along the Bozeng Highway starting on the 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Our Northern Route Army Advances Southward - We Head Straight for the Chantan Highway - The Enemy's Outer Perimeter of Foshan Has Been Broken - Civilians Joining the Ranks, Morale Soars <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Huaxian Correspondence] The counterattack of our northern route army has been victorious in recent days. The various units on the front line have captured important strongholds and are advancing towards the suburbs of Guangzhou. Huaxian, located north of the provincial capital, has been the site of fierce fighting between our troops and the enemy for the past ten days. Civilians in our occupied areas are assisting regular troops in fighting the enemy, and the battle situation is improving daily. The following is a report on the situation of our and enemy forces in Huaxian in recent days:</p>
<p>Li Zhen's Unit Advances to the Chantan Line</p>
<p>The Li Zhen unit of the 12th Army Group’s XX Division, originally stationed in the downstream of Xiaobei River, in Qīngyuǎn, Shijiao, and the Chibaini area of Huaxian, has recently moved south to control the enemy in Tanbu, Fengyong, and Wuhe along the Chantan line. They have reached their destinations and infiltrated Fengyong, Jinshan Temple, Dawo Guanyao, and Tanbu. Since the 9th, they have been fiercely fighting the enemy along the Chantan line with the Deng Longguang unit and the tax police regiment, which crossed the Xijiang River to counterattack. They once recaptured Fengyong, Jinxi, and other places, capturing many enemies. However, the enemy in Foshan, fearing that their outer perimeter would be broken through by us, reinforced their defenses along the Chantan Road on the 10th and 11th, stubbornly resisting our counterattacking forces. The battle is still ongoing. On the 12th and 13th, our troops fought fiercely in Baisha Bridge, Shanggang, and Fenghongling near Guanyao. Both our troops and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Li Zhen's division, in order to ensure victory, has secretly ordered XX and other regiments to rush to the front line to join the battle.</p>
<p>Huaxian's Guerrilla Force Active</p>
<p>The civilians in various villages and towns of Huaxian have been under the control of the enemy for several months, but they are devoted to the motherland. Many have spontaneously joined the guerrilla force. In addition, Wu Guanqui and Peng Linsheng, commanders of the Second District Guerrilla Column, have continuously sent political training personnel to various villages and towns in Huaxian to promote and mobilize extensive guerrilla warfare, further arousing their morale. It is now understood that the Huaxian guerrilla force has branches such as Huang Ruiliang and Huang Qiliang, cooperating with the Yan Jian unit of the Special Task Force and the Zhong Qi unit, with approximately XX personnel in total. They are strong and are distributed along the Chantan, Yuehan, Guanghua, and Chonghua lines to attack the enemy, which is extremely active. In recent days, our army's counterattack has achieved unprecedented victories. The guerrilla force and the civilians have greatly contributed to disrupting transportation, roads, and telephone lines, and restraining the enemy's communication and reinforcements.</p>
<p>Tanbu Has Been Controlled By Our Army</p>
<p>Also, according to military sources, since our army's counterattack from the west road on the evening of the 5th recaptured Sanjiang and Guanyao, the enemy's communication along the Chantan Highway has been interrupted. The enemy stationed in Tanbu and other places in the northern section of Chantan Highway has been surrounded and controlled by our army and has become a sitting duck. It is understood that the enemy troops stationed in Tanbu are only a few hundred in number, and their strength is weak. Therefore, they can only step up their defenses, dig deep trenches, and stubbornly defend their positions. On the morning of the 13th, Li's division dispatched a unit to attack the enemy in Tanbu. A certain company of our troops broke into Tanbu and engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat. The enemy's heavy artillery and mechanization lost their effectiveness. Our army advanced bravely, killing many enemies. The enemy's morale wavered, so they dispatched several aircraft to bomb our positions. Due to the terrain, our troops automatically retreated to their original positions and continued to monitor the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Completing War Preparation: Shantou Evacuates Population; Civil Servants' Families Given Three Days to Evacuate <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Shantou Express] Recently, the entire military situation is rapidly advancing. In order to allow the populace to avoid the danger of air raids, and to reduce unnecessary sacrifices in the event of war, the local authorities convened leaders of various city groups on the 11th to discuss evacuation standards. For the sake of swift implementation, the authorities issued a special order yesterday, the 12th, requiring all civil servants' families to complete evacuation within three days, as an example for the populace to follow. As for the plan to evacuate material resources, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also convened various trade associations to discuss it, and various steps have been decided upon.</p>
<h3 id="e47">A Glimpse of Guangzhou's Terror: Bandits Kill and Rob in Broad Daylight <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Since the × people occupied Guangzhou, the area has remained in a deathly quiet state for months. Although local shipping to Hong Kong has resumed, the number of people returning to Hong Kong from there each month far exceeds the number going from Hong Kong to there. Those who previously ventured there, mistakenly believing rumors, are now regretting their decision and are trying to leave, but it's not easy to obtain an "exit permit," forcing them to remain there in a very difficult situation. According to a notice posted yesterday by Jardine Matheson, the local army prohibits not only military supplies but also mail from being brought in. Furthermore, according to yesterday's South China Morning Post, an English newspaper in Hong Kong, it is very dangerous for those who carry large amounts of silver to go to Guangzhou, as they are easily suspected of having other motives. When the Foshan steamer recently arrived there, a large contingent of × troops boarded the ship and conducted a thorough search lasting two hours, causing great disturbance. In front of the ruins of the Southwest Restaurant in Xia Jiu Lu, a guerrilla fighter severely punished bandits in broad daylight. The × army was helpless. On that day, eight people (the eight people were guerrilla fighters) were traveling in a handcart when they were suddenly confronted by five bandits. Three of them, holding pistols, stopped them and ordered them to get out of the cart to be searched, or they would open fire. One of the passengers pretended to take out his wallet but suddenly drew two pistols and shouted at the bandits not to move. The other seven people also drew pistols and ordered the bandits to disarm. The bandits immediately threw down their weapons and fled. Later, two × soldiers heard the news and rushed to the scene, but they were also disarmed by the brave men. This shows a glimpse of the chaotic situation there.</p>

<p>[Zhongshan Express] In the recent battles on the Xinhui and Ningyang lines, we have made great progress. In Zhongshan and Shunde, although the × occasionally harassed, they were all defeated by our guerrilla teams. Yesterday's situation in various places is recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiangmen and Xinhui: × Taking a Defensive Posture</p>
<p>The war situation in the two strongholds of Xinhui and Jiangmen has completely turned for the better in recent days. The × army has been encircled. Although the × have reinforced several times, it has been of no avail. It was found that yesterday, the 13th, the × again used shallow-draft ships to transport more than 500 reinforcements from Daliang to reinforce the two strongholds of Huicheng and Jiangmen. Our troops, guarding Xiangshan, Wangyue Mountain, Daze near Huicheng, and the Jiangmen suburbs along the Jiang-Fo Highway, engaged in a fierce battle with the × for about three hours. The × suffered heavy casualties and turned to a defensive posture.</p>
<p>× Retreating Offshore: We Attacked Beijie</p>
<p>Our guerrilla team, taking advantage of the × army's withdrawal from Waihai, suddenly crossed the river from Guzhen when they entered on the afternoon of the 13th, taking the road through Waihai to attack Beijie, the East Fort, and the area south of the Menjiang River. The × army responded in haste and was attacked by our team, killing dozens of × soldiers and capturing more than ten rifles.</p>
<p>× Ships Harassing in Zhongshan County</p>
<p>The third, fifth, and ninth districts within Zhongshan have been unusually peaceful in recent days. Although the × occasionally intruded, they were all defeated by the Zhongshan garrison guerrilla team. Yesterday, the 13th, at about 3:00 PM, two × shallow-draft ships sailed from Yinggezui to Daliang, passing through Mawei Sha near Dahuangpu in the ninth district, and fired many shells at Mawei Sha. Our team calmly responded. After the × ships fired, seeing that we had no movement, they immediately sailed towards Daliang. It was also found that recently, there were four × ships anchored off Sanzao Island, two shallow-draft ships anchored off Dazhou, and × ships occasionally patrolling Tangzhou. There were no × ships in the Tangjiawan area.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Correspondence] The Central Government recently convened a national production conference and decided to start with agriculture first. It has issued orders to all provinces to take the opportunity to develop inland rural enterprises, vigorously promote various productions, and strive to enrich the resources for long-term resistance. It was found that Guangdong Provincial Chairman Li Han-hun, after receiving the order from the Central Government, once convened a conference of provincial agencies related to agriculture, and has made a whole decision on the inland agricultural production plan of this province. Recently, Chairman Li stated that the lack of finance in the current inland rural areas due to environmental influences is the biggest obstacle at present. For the sake of adjustment, it is planned to allocate funds to continue rural loans, and to restore the Rural Promotion Loan Committee of each county to be responsible for handling. The progress of each of these items is explored below:</p>
<p>Restoring Rural Loan Committees in Various Counties</p>
<p>It was found that the Rural Promotion Loan Committees in various counties of this province were established through the promotion of the Provincial Bank's Rural Loan Department, together with the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and the Grain Committee, before the situation in Guangdong changed. The Provincial Bank borrowed two million yuan from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Big Four Banks in installments and transferred them to the county cooperatives to adjust the rural economy. However, due to the outbreak of war in Guangdong Province, the loan affairs were virtually suspended. Chairman Li Han-hun now considers that it is necessary to take the opportunity to restore them in order to assist the countryside in the current situation in this province. He specially discussed with Gu Qun, the Director of the Finance Department and concurrently the Director of the Provincial Bank, and the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau to plan the restoration of the Rural Promotion Loan Committee in each county. Director Gu, upon receiving the instructions, has decided to establish a sound agency to be responsible for handling it. It is heard that in addition to co-organizing with the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, the Fourth War Zone Food Management Office will also be invited to participate and jointly establish the Provincial Wartime Rural Promotion Loan General Association. Before the establishment of the General Association, the County Rural Loan Associations will be restored first. Yesterday, the Provincial Bank's Rural Loan Department, together with the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, issued a notice to the counties, ordering them to prepare for the restoration as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Proceeding with Allocation of Loan Funds</p>
<p>Director Gu Qun, in order to expedite the work, has decided to contact the Big Four Banks of China to sign the second phase contract for the previously agreed two million yuan loan and continue to transfer the funds. It was found that the loan amount for the second phase contract is one million yuan, which can be signed and transferred in the short term after the negotiation is completed. According to a senior official of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, this province is continuing to prepare for the rural loan affairs, but due to the major changes in the inland rural areas, it is feared that one million yuan of loans will not be enough to distribute. It is now planned to ask the provincial government to find ways to allocate subsidies. As for the future loan methods, due to various difficult and changing circumstances, it is planned to re-determine them to adapt to the current situation. It is also heard that Director Gu plans to establish a Rural Loan Guidance Officer Training Class by the Provincial Bank's Rural Loan Department to train a large number of people to go to various counties to guide farmers in organizing cooperatives and handling loan work. The regulations of the training class have been handed over to the Rural Loan Department for planning and drafting, and preparations for training can be started as soon as various items are decided.</p>

<p>[Quanzhou Correspondence] The Fujian Provincial authorities, in order to support the textile industry cooperation, recently established a medium-term loan method with the Cooperation Business Management Office of the Construction Department, the Provincial Bank, and the Agricultural Bank of China, raising 560,000 yuan of production capital, dedicated to the development of inland industrial production. Anyone who wants to engage in industrial production in the inland can apply to the office for loans to operate. As of now, five counties in northwestern Fujian have formed weaving production cooperatives. Recently, the Xijie production cooperative in Shunchang County has also been established, with more than 70 members and more than ten iron looms. All equipment has now been completed, and the Provincial Bank's loan of 5,000 yuan has also been approved for release. The first batch of loans of 3,000 yuan has been allocated by the cooperative office to Fuzhou for transportation and negotiation. The cooperative office, together with the general manager of the cooperative, Zhou Guanlan, purchased cotton yarn, dyes, etc. in Rongdong and transported them to Shunchang, which will soon begin weaving.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Soviet Film Industry Changes Style: Starts Producing Love Films; Happy People as the First Sound <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The film industry occupies a very important position in the Soviet Union, but Soviet films are different from those in other countries. There are no glamorous, love, supernatural, or other films. They are all purely rigid historical and war films. Therefore, this can make the films help the progress of the Five-Year Plan and can also fulfill the duty of propaganda for Stalin. Therefore, most of the early Soviet films were current affairs and propaganda films. Since the start of the Second Five-Year Plan, the degree of cultural entertainment of the people has increased, and there have been films with subjects such as society and love as the theme. "Happy People," directed by Alexander Alexandrov, is the first shot of this kind of soft film.</p>
<p>Cartoons and color films are as naive as newborn children, and there are not many films. Some of the better ones are the color film "Circus" and the cartoon "New Garry." As for colorful cartoons like "Snow White," they have not been found so far.</p>
<p>The most famous historical film is "Peter the Great," which has been well received by people all over the world. The scale of this film is no less than the "Million Dollar Epic" of Hollywood.</p>
<p>"Thirteen Red Army Soldiers" and "Last Night" were produced to commemorate the great achievements of revolutionary soldiers. The plots and actors of these films are not bad, but unfortunately, there is no capable and lively director, so there are some shortcomings.</p>
<p>The famous film "Chapayev" is about a hero in the era of internal strife. This film is an outstanding work among sound films and broke the film record of the "Potemkin" era. Among the new films last year, the film that received the highest evaluation was "Lenin in October" directed by Romm. This film is a great epic that gathers the stars of the country.</p>
<p>Recently, Soviet films have gradually focused on the issue of national defense. Among the films produced, such as "One Day on the Border" and "For the Motherland," are all based on border disputes and espionage, to enhance the national defense concept of the people.</p>
<p>Currently, the film "Communist Youth City" is being produced, which depicts the lives of communist workers. This is nothing more than a propaganda film of communism. There is also a film based on a folk hero in the era of Imperial Russia. In this film, there is a scene of enemy troops retreating in embarrassment on a frozen river, and later the ice cracks and they drown. This is an unprecedented page in the history of Soviet film photography.</p>
<p>The Soviet government, in view of the lack of film talents and the bleak future of the film industry, recently established a film school in the suburbs of the capital, cultivating more than 2,000 talents, including stars, directors, film arrangers, and photographers. After graduation, the government guarantees them to work in film companies and also awards them honorary medals to encourage them to serve the country.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency] Japanese Minister of Education Araki met with film experts yesterday to explain the new law passed by the government prohibiting young people from all over the country from watching love films. At the same time, the censorship organs banned films and leisurely games that were considered to have adverse effects. The law stipulates that the films that Japanese young people can watch are limited to those with cultural and artistic value. Finally, it is stipulated that in the future, when cinemas show films that young people are not allowed to watch, they must clearly state it in the advertisements, and at the same time, conspicuous notices must be posted at the entrance of the cinemas.</p>

<p>The "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls" produced by China Film Production (the film has been screened in Chongqing and various places in Hong Kong) was recently shown at the Roosevelt Theater in New York. This is the first Chinese anti-Japanese war film to be publicly screened in the United States. The English translation of the film is "Resist to the End." Although the dialogue is in Chinese, because there are English subtitles, Chinese and foreign audiences can understand it.</p>
<p>This film not only shows the rapid progress of Chinese film technology, but also has greater significance, that is, it shows the enthusiasm and loyalty of the Chinese military and civilians to the Anti-Japanese War, so that friendly people who sympathize with China will have a better understanding after watching it.</p>
<p>After the film was released, all newspapers praised it unanimously, and the authoritative American film magazine "Variety Entertainment" also believed that "...this is a film that audiences who sympathize with the Chinese people like to watch. And many audiences who have never seen Chinese films with modern stories as their subject matter will have their wishes fulfilled because of this film... The story explains that China is resisting aggressors. It fully shows the great spirit of modern Chinese soldiers being loyal to the country... In any case, the performance can win the sympathy of the audience."</p>

<p>After all the excitement and stimulation had subsided, his right hand, except for being a little stiff, was considered to have recovered. He thought that all this would not cause any difficulty in his life. His life was performance. Before, he had played the piano in a movie theater. When he enlisted in the army, he was performing in a carnival. This performance life, in his own opinion, although it may not necessarily shine with gold, at least it still has bright colors.</p>
<p>He can sing a few songs, he can dance a few dances, and he also has a seductive outline that makes women fall in love. However, now this occupation makes his head swell. Since he and Ms. Xiulika cooperated, the sentence "Halifan is free" has become his mantra. He took a long breath, stood up, and left his makeup table. He suddenly became surprised because he saw a girl leaning against the closed door. She walked gently into his dressing room, and he didn't even notice it.</p>
<p>The girl looked at him, and this kind of gaze caused Halili to feel a burst of annoyance. He used the usual attitude to deal with this kind of woman and said exaggeratedly, "Okay, what do you want me to do for you? If you want to sign a commemorative album, I'm very sorry, I have never learned to read and write."</p>
<p>The girl smiled and shook her head. Halili looked at her and felt that she looked pretty good. She had a head of red hair, shining with purple-copper light, and a pair of azure blue eyes, glistening and looking at him.</p>
<p>"I'm not here to ask you to sign your name, Mr. Fan," she said quickly, "I have something important to tell you."</p>
<p>"What's the matter, baby?"</p>
<p>"Can I sit down and talk?"</p>
<p>"To be honest, I'm not very happy. But, sit down wherever you like."</p>
<p>"Thank you." She took a cigarette from the ashtray on the makeup table. "Can I steal a cigarette from you?" She said, already lighting the cigarette with a match.</p>
<p>"Of course! As you please!" He Lileng said coldly. "And, if you have a bottle of champagne on hand, you might as well open it! Now, if you don't mind, I want to change clothes. What are you here to say?"</p>

<h3 id="e56">The Final Moment of the Group A Football Championship: South China and Navy Compete for the Title; Held at the Navy Field at 4:30 PM This Afternoon; If South China Wins, Indirectly Creating Eastern's Position to Compete for Second Place <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Group A Football League has been calculating for many months, and South China, Navy, and Eastern have emerged as the top three on the standings.</p>
<p>The teams below Eastern have all played twenty games and have completed their mission. However, the second round game between Navy and South China has been postponed until today.</p>
<p>South China has played nineteen games, scoring thirty points, and Navy has also played nineteen games, scoring twenty-nine points. Therefore, due to the difference of one point, the importance of today's game has been created, as the final moment to compete for the championship.</p>
<p>We hope that the Chinese team can win the championship and create a glorious record. Therefore, we all wish South China victory in today's game, and don't let it end in failure.</p>
<p>If South China does not disappoint our expectations and completes the final victory, it will not only win the league championship, but also be enough to build a position to win the championship, and it will be more stable.</p>
<p>I think South China must win today. If they win, there are three points of significance. The first point is to win the league championship, taking the glorious heap of the younger brother (South China) and replacing it in the past, and no one else is allowed to ask about it. The second point is that if they can beat the Navy this time, then the third battle of the Xu and Cup at the end of the weekend can also be guaranteed, so today's game is a touchstone for winning the Xu and Cup. The third point is that when South China was embarrassed by the police a few days ago, just in time for the Eastern to also frustrate the Navy, South China was able to remain in a detached position, but don't forget Eastern's indirect help, and should have a way to repay the kindness. It is best to take today's opportunity to kill the Navy, which can not only win one's own glory, but also help Eastern to get out, because if the Navy loses, the points will be the same as Eastern, and there will be another runner-up final. Then, Eastern may also beat the Navy and jump to second place.</p>
<p>There is also one point, if our Chinese team wants to win the championship, they must defeat the Navy in a row, because of the six major championships, our Chinese team has already won two. The remaining three items are the league, the international competition, and the Xu and Cup. The championship issue of the league and the international competition will be resolved one after another today and tomorrow. But the most coincidental thing is that in the league and the Xu and Cup, our Chinese team has an encounter with the Navy for the championship, so there is no doubt that the Navy is the obstacle of our Chinese team, and the key to whether or not to win the championship is also the sea.</p>
<p>The Football Association originally wanted to hold this league championship battle earlier in this month, but it did not get the consent of the Navy. The Navy believed that holding it earlier was very unfavorable to its own team, because at the beginning of this month, there were still many warships going out to sea, and the strong players could not gather, so it was not until today that they met with South China. The ambition of the Navy can also be imagined.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the reporter investigated from the relevant aspects of the Navy and learned that the Navy's battle line was roughly determined, but it is not known whether there will be more hard work at that time. Looking closely at the military posts, most of them are Japanese people, and their names are very unfamiliar, so how their skills are is still a mystery and must be revealed after the war breaks out.</p>
<p>The old people are Hanyaweilu, Xuandi, Yanshi Delang, and Tuoban four, and their skills are good and have long been appreciated by general fans. As for the skills of the newcomers, I believe it must be good, because there are more than ten warships currently docked in Hong Kong. If they are not outstanding members, they will never be selected. Moreover, this battle is the life and death of the Navy. In addition to the determination to win, it is hopeless to lose, and a draw will not work. Since the battle is so important, the selection of people must also be painful, so there is a group of fans who think that the Navy has sent more new players to the battle, and the strength may not be strong. I am deeply happy for South China, but I feel that this point is absolutely not happy, but worried, because the Navy has more newcomers, and the truth is unknown. If their strength increases due to the use of more newcomers, then South China's victory may not be sure. I hope that the South China generals will be cautious.</p>
<p>According to what I have seen, although the Navy's left inner defender Xuandi's skills are good, he is not very stable. The right midfielder Hanyaweilu can only be loyal to his duties, but the position is not appropriate. The right winger Yanshi Delang is very agile, and his surgery is also accurate. The left inner Tuoban is good at running, but his shooting skills are not very good, but the Navy's forwards have always lacked the last kick.</p>
<p>However, the Navy can reach this position and compete with Nanfu for the title. They naturally have other strengths and are not fortunate to get this. As far as we know, although the Navy's strategy has no fixed way, the connection is what they value, the performance is advanced and retreated, and the forwards are often willing to attack, in order to make up for their lack of guards, so the South China guards should be wary of their sudden Wei attack.</p>
<p>Because Mai Shaohan is sick, there have been changes in South China's defense. Li Guowei was transferred to the left inner guard, and Guo Yingqi was the right midfielder. Guowei served in this position in the special silver medal final and performed well. With his quick feet, he will definitely be able to deal with the Navy's forwards today. But I hope to be careful. If he is sharp enough, there will be no problem. If he is too sharp, he may cause trouble. Yingqi is better at being a midfielder than a forward. He is also good at supplying passes, but Liu Qingcai seems to be unaccustomed to the steps when he is the right midfielder, and there are many flaws. If he is unaccustomed and not improved, he will cause trouble. It is best for him to switch with Yingqi, because Yingqi can be both left and right. The problem lies with Qingcai himself.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping has seen good works since he returned to guard the door. He is an old hand. Today, he is still in love with him and takes on the important task. He is better than Zhang Rongcai, and the former "threshold" of the Zhejiang army is not precise. Jiaping will be able to cope with it easily. He doesn't need us. He is more talented in command. He can't be without him in an important game.</p>
<p>Regarding this championship battle, someone suggested to South China that it is best to invite Li Huitang to play, but Hui has already claimed that he will not participate in the league, and even if he is invited, he may not agree.</p>
<p>Several military divisions of the South China Football Department have carefully considered the front line to fight today. They finally dislike Li Enliang's new experience and lack of experience, so they decided to start the veteran Ye Beihua to fill the left inner forward. Three or four years ago, Beihua served in this position, and had a tacit cooperation with Feng Jingxiang. Later, due to foot injuries and working in the Guangdong Provincial Government, he stopped his activities in the stadium. He returned to Hong Kong from Shantou last month, and he was happy to see the wax and practiced again. He has already met with the fans in the star China and China United performance matches a few days ago. Now that South China needs talents on the front line, he will serve the mother club again. I believe he will be better than Enliang on the front line, and he is used to cooperating with Jingxiang. They sing and he agrees. He must receive a joint effect, and the front line is undoubtedly active.</p>
<p>When Beihua plays, the front line's strategy will focus on triangular short passes, with Jingxiang in the middle, taking care of both sides, with greater responsibility, but it is not easy to achieve results with only short passes. It is still necessary to see the opportunity to use the wings. The best policy is to be able to attack from all sides, and to encourage Luo Douwen to cheer up and not delay things, so as not to miss the fighter.</p>
<p>In short, South China's victory call is very high, and they must work hard to win. The great championship is none other than South China. The lineups of the two teams and the scores of each team are as follows (Ball Park Taisui)</p>

<p>The Hong Kong port city football team to Macao is scheduled to take a boat to Macao tomorrow morning. At 3:30 PM, they will officially compete against the Macao port city team at the dog racing track. The Macao team is not weak and should not be underestimated, as no foreign team has ever won there. Last year, when the British Corinthian team visited Hankou, they only managed a draw. This year, the Philippine port city team and the Singapore Chinese team both returned defeated. Therefore, the Macao team has reason to be proud. The Hong Kong team for this competition consists mostly of young players from the First Division. Although they cannot be called the elite of Hong Kong, their fighting power is quite strong. Unfortunately, right-back Bill Byne (captain) cannot accompany the team due to a knee injury and will be replaced by Ha Xian. However, this should not significantly affect the team's strength. The Macao team's lineup is quite complete, with Jiang Shan Jing as the inside back and Gao La Su as the midfielder. The other players are also experienced and capable. The team lists for both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>[External News] This year's Davis Cup International Tennis Championship, due to the East, shows ease and sends a team to join. China is unwilling to lag behind and actively participates. Most gratifyingly, the representatives are well-chosen, comprising Xu Chengji, Cai Huiquan, and He Renxuan, all currently studying in Europe and having participated in Wimbledon last year. Xu Chengji will be the first singles player, Cai Huiquan the second singles player, and He Renxuan will partner with Xu Chengji in doubles. This strong lineup is unprecedented for the Chinese tennis team. China has a bye in the first week, but in the second week, they will face France, with rising stars and veteran Bolo Wanra. If they can overcome this difficult hurdle, they will proceed to the third week and then the fourth week. This is because if they pass the second week, they will face England. Since Pan has changed professions, England lacks successors, and their strength has declined. Xu Chengji of China defeated Austin, a famous English player, 2-1 in the finals of the British Open Hard Court Tennis Championship. Therefore, if Xu meets Austin again, he is likely to win. Cai Huiquan has also won various championships in England. If they both perform well and win three singles matches, England will be defeated, and China's tennis reputation will be known worldwide. The schedules for the first and second weeks are translated below.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Reporter's Special Holiday Association's Excursion to Lantau Island <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Phoenix Mountain trip organized by the Reporter's Special Holiday Association departed on time yesterday morning. Fifteen members and their relatives participated, including Guang Jun and two others from Queen's College. Arriving at Tung Chung around 7:00 AM, Mr. Situ Guang, the physical education director of Wah Ying College, greeted them at the riverside and led them to visit the school (formerly the site of the ancient city). They also attended the flag-raising ceremony held by the school's staff and students. The magnificent national emblem was hung high above the ancient city, creating a spectacular sight. Mr. Xie Zhili, the academic director, and professors Zheng Hemen, Lu Quanguang, and others warmly welcomed them and held a tea party. Due to its excellent environment, the school's students have achieved outstanding results in physical education. Around 10:00 AM, they began their ascent, taking two routes. Seven people went to Ang Ping via Di Tang Tsai, while eight went directly to Phoenix Mountain via Di Tang Tsai. The weather was cloudy and rainy, with thick fog covering the mountain. It was not suitable for climbing the peak, as even if they reached the top, they would not be able to see the surrounding scenery. However, Mr. Kuang and others were determined to reach the summit, and everyone was determined to get to their destination. After one hour and forty minutes of walking, they finally reached the peak, having traversed slippery roads and wet grass. They were all wet and exhausted. Due to the thick fog, they could not see more than a few feet in any direction. Considering the danger, they rested for a while and then returned to Tung Chung along the same route, unable to fulfill their original plan of descending from the peak to Ang Ping and then to Tai O to meet the other group. However, they had no choice. They swam and played soccer in the swimming pool of Wah Ying College in Tung Chung. Around 7:00 PM, they took a boat back, where they met the other group. Everyone said that the trip was enjoyable in its own way, both bitter and sweet.</p>

<p>— Shi Li Hua</p>
<p>I departed from Xianggang on April 2nd. As soon as I boarded the ship, I knew that the Qing Yuan wheel needed to stop at Guangzhou Bay and Beihai. I asked the purser on board, and he replied that it would take five days at the earliest and six days at the latest. Who knew that we would arrive in Haiphong on the morning of the seventh, rush to Hanoi, and arrive in Hanoi at 4:45 PM. At 5:05 PM, we took the field in full gear. As expected, "success came immediately," winning the first game 4-1 and the second game 3-0, to the great delight and welcome of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Of the 17 members of the team, many were not accustomed to sailing. At the first dinner on board, 11 people were present; at the second, there were 15; at the third, one; at the fourth, none; and at the fifth, seven. After that, we returned to the original state, with all 17 people present, laughing and talking, and eating heartily. This was because a strong wind blew from Guangzhou, causing the ship to pitch and roll violently. After Haikou, the wind was calm, like being on the Yangtze River. In terms of seasickness, Xu Wenkui was the worst, followed by Zhang Jinhai, Wu Qixiang, Zeng Zhongyun, Yu Qiaoyu, and Chen Bingtu. Sang Yu and I can say that we were the most resistant to the waves.</p>
<p>The goal-scoring records for the first two games, in simple terms, were:</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting three goals, Li Deqi two goals, Xu Wenkui and Zhang Jinhai one goal each.</p>
<p>But with the addition of Xu, Cao, and Zhang to the expedition team, the forward line was exceptionally strong, and the players had discussed their tactics on the ship, enabling them to understand each other tacitly. The low passes of the two inside forwards were considered by the Hanoi football community to be "not weaker than South China." Individually, the following assessments can be made:</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan was calm and composed, making timely saves. Miao Huaguo made strong clearances and was able to block the enemy's forward progress. Generally, he was considered better than Chu Yun, but Zhongyun was still as steady as before, but his footwork and speed seemed not as good as in the last two or three games in Hong Kong. Xu Jingcheng was still brave, shooting four times in the two games, hitting the target three times, but unfortunately, they were all palmed out. But the imposing manner of his running around the field seemed slightly less than when he was in Hong Kong, perhaps because he didn't need to work so hard. Luo Weiquan's position and distribution were good, performing at his peak. Wu Qixiang also made remarkable progress and ran powerfully. Xu Buyun is not a midfielder; he should be reassigned to inside defense next time.</p>
<p>On the forward line, Li Deqi was still the same, but commendably willing to work hard, and the two goals he scored were also good. Xu Wenkui's clever flick pass and his posture of jumping over people have been praised by the people of Hanoi. Zhang Jinhai worked hard and was well-positioned. Cao Qiuting was better in the first game than in the second; his footwork seemed better than Hou Chengtuo, but his speed was not as good. Chen Bingtu did not give an amazing performance in the two games due to a slight ankle injury, but he was one of the best in the last ten minutes of both games. Yu Qiaoxing could connect well with Xu and Zhang, but he was timid.</p>
<p>In terms of shooting technique, Wenkui should be considered the best and most admirable. His volley shot was extremely beautiful. Qiuting's shots were often difficult for the opposing goalkeeper to defend. Deqi's strange foot was resolute, and even he himself could not explain how he scored one of the goals in the third game.</p>
<p>In addition, Liu Xianhan let in one (not his fault, as he was facing three enemy forwards with no inside defense, and was helpless). Xian Weiquan lost a penalty kick (actually, it was not a bad kick, but the B team goalkeeper was brave and saved it into a corner kick).</p>
<p>The first game was against Junlian. This team was known for its burly physique, but lacked skill in shooting. The situation in the first half was quite balanced. The Eastern team began to show its edge in the last 15 minutes of the second half, quickly scoring two goals, perhaps because the Eastern team members had been traveling for a long time and had difficulty getting into top form.</p>
<p>In the second game against the B selection team, the opponent's defense adopted a "one-on-one" tactic, which was quite skillful and unusually brave. Their goalkeeper once saved a penalty kick and once ran to Cao Qiuting's heels to save a ball, both with beautiful leaps. The right inside back once made a flying header, his entire body straight and five feet off the ground, which was truly amazing. The weakness of this team was that the forwards were not good at using timing when shooting. Xianhan handled the situation with ease.</p>
<p>From the two games, the Eastern team was good at both attack and defense (in Hong Kong, they emphasized defense).</p>
<p>The originally scheduled game in Haiphong has now been canceled. Before the Eastern team arrived, Haiphong and Hanoi competed for the right to fight first. As a result, Hanoi defeated Haiphong 5-1 (Zeng Peifu was the Haiphong goalkeeper). Haiphong therefore withdrew from this invitational tournament. Mr. Zeng Peifu is now in contact and plans to play one more game after the Eastern team completes three games against Hanoi. Shunhua, the capital of Annam, is currently holding a triennial exhibition, and has sent a telegram inviting the Eastern team to perform a game. The date is currently being discussed. (According to a telegram from the Eastern team yesterday, they won 2-1). Saigon has also telegraphed through Hanoi to arrange a game, and they are currently discussing the date. It is likely that the Eastern team will return to Hong Kong in the first four or five days of the end of the month.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Scholar's Rebellion <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zai Tian</p>
<p>There is an old saying:</p>
<p>"The scholar's rebellion will never succeed in three years."</p>
<p>The so-called "never succeed in three years" does not mean that it will succeed in the fourth year, but that it will never succeed.</p>
<p>Examining the reasons for "the scholar's rebellion never succeeding in three years," first, it is probably because scholars are timid and suspicious, and are not enough to make long-term plans, cope with great difficulties, and create great undertakings. The so-called scholar, of course, is a soft-boned intellectual who comes from literature. History shows that most intellectuals in all eras are despicable, good at flattering masters and dignitaries, and siding with the rulers of the time. Most of these intellectuals are flag-wavers or secretly plotters. If you really give him a spear and let him break through the siege or capture enemy flags, the intellectual will definitely not do it. Not only will he not do it, but it can even be said that he dares not, because he is still attached to the world of fame and fortune and is willing to survive to serve another master with loyalty and enjoy the blessings of fame and fortune. The biggest reason why the scholar's rebellion cannot succeed is probably this.</p>
<p>Second, the scholar's words often do not match his heart. He does not speak honestly, but engages in sneaky behavior. However, in public, he makes grand pronouncements, speaking of high-sounding principles. There is no need to cite ancient examples; just take recent examples, such as the capitulationism advocated by the Wang clique. On the surface, they completely claimed that it was to save the country and the people, but in secret, they colluded with the public enemy of the Chinese nation, made agreements, and took money. They said on the outside that so-and-so was "martyred for the country," but how could they be "martyred for the country"? Words do not match actions, and most cases are like this.</p>
<p>If they had openly stated their actions and conditions for selling out the country, and publicly asked the people of the country to choose for themselves, and let the people of the country curse them, it would have been one thing. But they did not do that. Instead, they pretended to be loyal subjects planning for the country, secretly negotiated terms with the Japanese, and at the same time repeatedly said, "We have not taken any action!"</p>
<p>There is a passage in Chen Quanru's "Crazy Man's Words," Volume 1, discussing the reasons why strategists cannot succeed, saying:</p>
<p>"When the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked; when the enemy country is destroyed, the strategist dies. Since ancient times, there have been few who have escaped this fate. There is also a reason for this. Most strategists are not wise ministers who assist the king, but mediocre people who are good at using schemes and ingratiating themselves with the ruler. They may appear to be loyal to their ruler for a time, but their hearts are always deceitful and ugly. Not only are they ugly, but they are also feared."</p>
<p>The strategists mentioned in the passage are still those who are loyal to their country. Because of their "schemes and ingratiating themselves with the ruler," they aroused the distrust and suspicion of the ruler, and lost their lives. How much more so for those strategists who forget their country and surrender to the enemy?</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu devoted half his life to serving the Japanese, and ended up being "cooked like a hunting dog." The fate of Wang is unimaginable. How much more so for surrenderers like Wang, who are cunning and fickle, change their allegiance in times of crisis, and shrink back in the face of adversity? They are the mediocre people who are more than capable of betrayal but incapable of building a nation. Although they can use "ingratiating themselves with the ruler" to please for a time, they will not ultimately escape the precedent of "when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked."</p>
<p>There is another saying in "Crazy Man's Words," Volume 1:</p>
<p>"The bait of official rank can catch mediocre people, but not attract heroes. The boat of fame can carry flattering scholars, but not drown heroes." Wang's acceptance of four million gold notes twice shows that he is nothing more than a lecherous and greedy person, a crazy and contemptible person who has betrayed his ancestors. How can he taste the flavor of a puppet emperor? Therefore, the rebellion of the Wang clique, who act as accomplices for the enemy, can be called a scholar's rebellion.</p>
<h3 id="e68">New Widows' Street (Continued) <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>No longer is there someone sitting on the chair, no longer is there someone leaning on the window, no longer is there someone sleeping in the bed, yet it is not as if the person is gone. That day, with trembling hands, she held the long-streamered flag, standing at the ×× post station, watching him go with a smile and tears. It was as if he were an ancient world-shaking hero, draped in armor, holding a long spear, galloping on a warhorse. Yes, historically, these conscripts have caused several famous massacres and famous lootings, setting fires. He should still be on the continent of East Asia, bravely wielding the poisonous fire with the timidity of a refugee talisman, engaging in bestial combat against humanity. Unintentionally, we turned our faces back from the escape route, only to see the tears of the arsonist.</p>
<p>The person in the photo only smiles and does not speak. Only smiles, yet can never stop smiling like that. Moreover, the person is reduced in size, becoming eight inches, placed in a frame, hung on the wall; even smaller. Becoming four inches, clipped in a book, kept in a pocket.</p>
<p>As if reminiscing about a hunted thief, she prays to the gods, wishing that he could return safely, which would be more than enough. Becoming rich through plunder or achieving fame at the cost of life is not important at all.</p>
<p>She goes to ×× Shrine...</p>
<p>I left the top corner of the newspaper and came to the lower end of the second page, which was a street. I came to this street. The center of the street was desolate, and the low houses along the street were lined up like silver. I only occasionally saw one or two open windows, with low-hanging bamboo curtains.</p>
<p>Ah! The New Widows' Street—</p>
<p>This is too slight a sound. It seems I hear it. I put aside the picture album in my hand and see myself still deeply seated in an old-fashioned circular chair. This is old furniture from my father's era. Following me, it also lives a wandering life. It is always contemplative and shares a part of its contemplation with me.</p>
<p>The sky is getting darker. The old clock still whispers tick-tock, and I know that soon, tomorrow, a delicate hand will snatch the peachwood pipe from the corner of my mouth, throw it into the fire to burn; my lighter will be taken to the kitchen, because we will have to cook for ourselves, and at least I will have to be at a banquet once, my cheeks flushed red,</p>
<p>because I am about to get engaged. Yes, isn't it good to settle down?</p>
<p>(The End)</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Blood Wine of Life <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Yibai</p>
<p>"Drink me the blood wine of life, return me with freedom and light."</p>
<p>I jump, I want to howl, I want to cry, no; I am going crazy.</p>
<p>The surroundings are pitch black, there is no daylight, no light, not even a star.</p>
<p>People say spring has come, but I don't see it. Is it covered by tall buildings? Is it frightened away by the gunfire? Maybe it's buried in the rubble. Ah! Where is spring?</p>
<p>I love freedom, but some people just won't let you be free. Do you want to hang the national flag? They will tell you to take it down. Do you love your country? Maybe someone will interfere with you. Ah! You are not free, do you know?</p>
<p>Look at the ghostly creatures, they laugh; they dance; they sell their souls, they sell everything. Everything revolves around you, darkness invades you, terror attacks you, and fame and fortune tempt you. Suffocating you, making you angry, making you disgusted.</p>
<p>This is an isolated island! No freedom, no light, you are not allowed to move, you can only be a person who is well-behaved.</p>
<p>Give me the blood wine of life, because I am too depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Leaving Songzhuang <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Memories of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou</p>
<p>When retreating from Yuwang Mountain, the order said to retreat to Phoenix Mountain, Tortoise Head Mountain, and Suyang Mountain. Unexpectedly, after resting in Songzhuang for two days, another order came: retreat to Yunlong Mountain!</p>
<p>Where is Yunlong Mountain? It is said to be in Xuzhou. At that time, the × people had quietly sneaked between Mengcheng and Yongcheng onto the Suihai Road, blown up the Huangkou Iron Bridge, and were encircling Xuzhou...</p>
<p>But we didn't believe that Xuzhou would be lost. When we transferred from Pinghan Road to Longhai Road and passed through Xuzhou to Taierzhuang, we only casually glanced at Xuzhou before hastily parting ways. Now, hearing the order to retreat to Yunlong Mountain, we were all very happy, because we could go to Xuzhou again. But at the same time, we felt a bit sad. This much land, this much wheat, was going to be trampled by the iron hooves of the × people.</p>
<p>With infinite reluctance, one night, while the people of Songzhuang were sound asleep, we quietly left Songzhuang and set off for Xuzhou.</p>
<p>People, one after another, walked urgently. The cavalry, comfortable, riding on their strong horses, half-ran to the front. The heavy artillery, pulled by eight large mules, rolled slowly at the rear of the column. The horrible yellow dust drilled into people's nostrils and mouths, making people feel a bit suffocated.</p>
<p>The trucks carrying military supplies came rumbling from behind. The strong lights made people dare not turn around to look at them. They could only stand on the side of the road to let them pass, then blend into the dust and catch up with the column ahead.</p>
<p>The sky was dotted with countless bright stars, and the earth was so dark and deep. The boundless field of wheat, which had been caressed by the breeze during the day, swaying lively in the fields, had been swallowed by darkness. The trees appeared as dark shadows, standing like giants. The night wind, carrying a bit of coldness, blew towards people from time to time, making people feel a bit cold!</p>
<p>The villages in the distance often attracted bursts of dog barking due to the sound of people's footsteps. Apart from that, there was not a sound. Everything was so quiet.</p>
<p>The endless column, like a black current, flowed silently in the vast wilderness to the north, without stopping, as if they were all iron-cast men and horses, never tiring.</p>
<p>At dawn, to avoid the × people's planes, we stopped in a small village called Huangguang, with only four or five families, but the people had already run away. At dusk, the column continued forward along the highway covered with three or four inches of yellow dust.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!... Suddenly, a clear burst of gunfire came from the front, followed by more and more dense fire. In the chaotic gunfire, the cannon sounds also rang out loudly. Soon, a red light floated up in front, illuminating the sky so red.</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Probably in contact with the × people!"</p>
<p>But it didn't seem like contact with the × people at all. The column was not afraid at all and continued to advance. Bullets whizzed past their sides.</p>
<p>Boom! Suddenly, a red light like lightning, followed by a startling explosion, lit up, illuminating the villages nearby, which had been shrouded in darkness, so clearly. This made us exclaim in surprise, and involuntarily quickly lowered our heads:</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>No one knew. Everyone walked mechanically with a tense heart, but soon a message came from the front: this was a friendly army obeying orders to retreat, and had automatically burned the military supplies that could not be taken away at the Daxujia Station on the Longhai Road. Although this was unavoidable, although it destroyed the Longhai Road, preventing the × army from advancing along the railway line from Pixian southward, we all felt an unspeakable heartache when we thought that the bullets bought with the blood of the people could not be fired into the chests of the × people one by one!</p>
<p>Some cars that had broken down somewhere were abandoned by the roadside and no one cared. Horses and cattle that had been exhausted from dragging military supplies lay on the highway covered in yellow dust, making people feel a sense of desolation. Even the horses and cattle were dead from walking, could our two feet withstand it? But after all, we are not horses and cattle, walk! walk! walk!</p>
<p>Walking non-stop, eyes that hadn't slept for two nights were as if something was pressing on the eyelids, and the eyelids just wanted to close from time to time, and the head was so dizzy, it was already in a state of semi-sleep, but our minds were clear, we were still vigilant.</p>
<p>As the east spit out a hazy dawn, we finally arrived at the camp—Tongcun.</p>

<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>This is not a remote mountain wilderness, nor is it a vast ocean. This is a vast expanse of land, a vast desert of countless yellow sands piled up.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles, tens of thousands of miles, no way to be seen, no end to be seen, what is seen is the cloudy sky, the boundless sand, no lovely pleasing green, no exuberant vitality.</p>
<p>All year round it is so quiet, without a trace of human habitation, unbearably desolate, this desert prevents people from going forward, like a towering mountain soaring into the clouds, cannot be walked past, cannot be jumped past, nor can it be crossed!</p>
<p>Crossing a large river, crossing a vast sea, does not require any strength, but crossing this vast desert requires great perseverance!</p>
<p>In the desert, no one dares to venture deep: only those fighting heroes, and their faithful companion - the camel, with a spirit of transcendence, cross this desolate world!</p>
<p>No sunlight, no water, and no place to rest, only hard forward progress, enduring hunger and thirst!</p>
<p>That whirlwind, rolled up the sand, causing travelers to lose their way, but this does not give them any fear, they stopped for a moment, cheered up, and moved forward again!</p>
<p>Vast expanse, after endless time, has not yet reached the destination, but they will not be discouraged, still slowly moving, they know: one day, they will jump out of the death-like world, embarking on the "success" of the way!</p>

<p>— Shuqun</p>
<p>To weaken the sound of the gunshot and avoid accidents, he had to hold the gun against her chest or back; this action could be completed instantly with just a slight movement of the hand. Who knew that such a small action would be such a difficult task?</p>
<p>"Ah, using my body to exchange for money... Humph..."</p>
<p>She couldn't say the words.</p>
<p>To save oneself from death, people sometimes waver in their resolve. Especially her—a weakling. But she wasn't completely like that. On one hand, she was reluctant to give up her life, and on the other hand, she was moved by him, his voice, his movements, his vague posture; unfortunately, it wasn't in daylight or in a place with lights, otherwise, there would also be his face—the outer appearance of his heart, so that she could grab the hand holding the gun earlier and say softly:</p>
<p>"Put it away!"</p>
<p>She had subdued him.</p>
<p>An unexpected beginning, and an unexpected end.</p>
<p>At this time, he was lost in the sudden change, opening his arms, angrily embracing her, but afraid of violating the limits of the dignity maintained by that woman; so his arms were only moving in space, unable to find a place to rest on her body.</p>
<p>At the same time, she looked at his restless hands, as if moving and stretching congealed blood in the air, and she asked:</p>
<p>"Are you cold?"</p>
<p>"No, my hands are too hot."</p>
