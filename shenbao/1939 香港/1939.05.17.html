<p>日×的後方　上海　鮮血染紅了輝煌的國旗</p>
<p>【上海通訊】上海　一孤島，關於國旗的問題，從去年到現在曾發生過不少可　可泣的壯烈事蹟。</p>
<p>壯烈往事</p>
<p>去年爲紀念八一三週年紀念，靠租界同華界交界的地方，回爲懸旗，×軍竟開　向租界中住戶所懸靑天白日旗射擊，所以到現在，每逢紀念日，那一些地方就不大容易看到靑天白日旗。</p>
<p>也是去年吧，大約是雙十節的時候，滬西越界築路勞勃生路有一家米店，因懸靑天白日旗，竟被×軍官發現，企圖把它搶去，並且還想逞兇，幸而美兵出來干涉，得吿無事，不過從此以後越界築路地段，懸靑天白日旗的就僅見了。</p>
<p>四行孤軍因懸國旗致遭白俄兵毆傷多名，這是讀者們都知道的事；但是自從那次糾紛之後，他們升旗的旗桿就沒有以前高了。</p>
<p>今年春天浦東有一壯士到東昌路一帶去懸國旗，不幸被捕，被日方砍掉了頭腦，在未砍頭之前，×兵把靑天白日旗穿在竹竿上將竹竽的另一端削尖刺入他的背脊上，並且押解他在東昌路等處游行；凡是看到的中國人都不禁下淚。無怪偽警，逼迫住那些地方的人們去懸偽旗的時候，他們不是不掛，就是倒掛，或下牟旗。</p>
<p>慘劇開場</p>
<p>自從三月十二·三月二十九，法租界當局兩次干涉懸扭國旗之後，住在法租界內的中國人，對於懸掛國旗的事，看得很重要了。所以　在四月十九日精神總動員農工商宣傳日，在法租界的住戶商店，都不約而同的，爭先懸旗，誰知竟因此發生了糾紛，慘劇，以致造成大罷市。</p>
<p>上午九點的光景，有大批的俄捕，越捕來干涉　旗的商店同住戶，要他們卸下來，有的是不肯，有的是朋辦了，在通常的怕例，因不遵卸旗頂多是罰款，所以有許多商店住戶甯願受罰不願卸下，郎卸下者不久？懸上去，不意俄捕同越捕竟因此打人捉人並且將旗沒收，更有越捕俄捕用刺刀把已遵命卸下的國旗劃破，或撕成一條一條的，或丢在地上，以致把國旗污損多處，「不讓懸旗也罷，但不應當這樣的侮辱代表中國國家的國旗呀！』於是各商店紛紛自動關門休業，表示　議。</p>
<p>到了四時以後，自動休業，表示抗議的商店更多了，七時後一條素日熱閙非常，燈光輝煌的法大馬路完全變成鬼市，被黯淡而悽慘的氣氛籠罩着，人們都在憤慨着，沉默着，裝甲車雖不時過來過去，誰也不去注意它，俄捕越捕雖很神氣的拿着木棍，後來亦潮漸的感覺沒趣了，人數亦漸漸的减少了。</p>
<p>認清×人</p>
<p>二十日上午法租界已陷入完全大罷市狀態中，十時以後罷市更多了。市商會勸吿復業亦沒有效果。最後納稅華人會發出通吿說明爲顧全中法邦交一向敦睦情誼，此次事端俱由越捕俄捕措施不當，愼重從事，俾得據理交涉涉，但爲　奸人從中作祟，還望忍痛一時先行復業。同時寓港某滬上巨紳亦來電各重要公團請認淸敵人，妥爲處理，於是四時以後各商，都聽從勸吿，先行復業。</p>
<p>國旗在上海經過這麽多的中華兒女們的奮鬥與犧牲，他終必有一天，在舉世歡騰的一天，除侵略者外。各友　都自動的把本國的國旗同我們的靑天白日族一同升起來。</p>
<p>我們的後方　桂林　初夏聯允會　允送鹿亘（桂林通訊）自從武漢撤退後，鹿地亘先生卽遷居桂林，至今已整整五個半月了，在這一個時期中，他除掉完成一篇十萬餘字的「和平村記」外，對×情作進一步之研究，且曾去×地××訓練班講學，歸來後又担任日語訓練班的專任講師，講解×人最近情勢，及對×的宣傳工作的要點。他在日語訓練班裏雖則並沒有很長的逗留，但每星期來每天緊張的講授和帮助同學解决了許多問題，使同學得到很大的敎益，因之當他因公要暫與桂林吿別時，同學們特別舉行一個同樂會，一方面是對他表示歡送，同時大家痛快的聯歡一下，加强今後學習精神，來表示不辜負師長們對他們的期望。</p>
<p>時間就在七日下午六時，在那塊廣大綠色的草坪上，晚風　吻在整齊草綠色的軍服上，二百餘位男女同學們圍坐成一個圓圈在傾聽着鹿地見先生之臨別贈言，今天鹿地亘特別興奮的揮動着拳頭，有節奏的語調表示他對這二百餘靑年的愛護，雖則是暫吿離別，在大家的心裏確永遠蘊蓄着共同的情緒，與暴力『爭到底的决心，並且特別愼重的提出今後政治工作者始終應該把握着之要點：『……戰爭是劍與劍的交鋒，而政在工作是無形的搏鬥，如果我們有一些疏忽，×人就會給我們致命傷，因之政治工作者隨處該特別小心特別努力的進行工作凡事必定從根本求了解求得全盤的認識，譬如×人最近要想在淪陷區開拓五百萬噸鐵，現正在計劃中，我們如要設法打破這計劃，我們一定要求對整個問題求得了解，一定要設法知道×現在開拓五百萬噸鐵究竟需要資本多少？現乃計圖到如何程度？我們有了具體的知識基礎，我們才可得到線索，然後從這線索中去擊破×人之陰謀，同時，我們隨時要緊張的，不放鬆一分鐘的對事物之觀察和認議，這就是要用精神總動員的力量去克服了。所以如果每個國民對任何事實有獨到之觀察，那精神總動員就可以說達到成功的地步了了……』。最後鹿地亘再重覆說：「我們共同堅苦鬥爭下去，我們的血管永遠注着共同的血液……』</p>
<p>當鹿地亘的演說在一陣熱烈的掌聲中結束後馮乃超簡潔有力的演辭響在大家的耳際，他說明語言是一種武器，今日我們所學的日本語，可以把他當作炸藥擲入×人陣地，給×人以極大的威脅，而他日日本軍閥與我們相搏鬥吿一段落時，我們將利用這武器來消滅民埃間相互的隔閔和仇視，建立永久的人類的和平，所以各位在這最短促的時間裏所學習的並不是浪費的，而負有特別偉大的任務。</p>
<p>王組長陪着鹿地亘，馮乃超兩位，在那由自已填成的土墩上，用過晚餐後，在晚風中看着同學熱誠的聯歡，表演，歌唱，直到九時光景他倆才辭別這充滿跳躍的空氣而歸去。</p>
<p>戰時的首都　重慶　×機大縱火　山城義憤高</p>
<p>（重慶通訊）太陽巳經斜照着山城，天快到了贡昏時候。人們正在凖備去參加五四紀念會，一聲長的警報笛響了，由於「五三」敵人在重慶的狂炸，人們在緊急警報之前，都已躱藏到防空地帶，隨着緊急警報×機襲入了重慶天空。×機排好的隊形，早已被我們髙射砲打散，×機在天空惶張地同這具有人　歷史文明的山城，紛亂地拋下燒夷彈，燒夷彈在空中就燃燒起來，幾百個紅的火球從空中落到重慶的市中心，×慌惶亂地拋彈之後，在我機驅逐之下，匆忙忙地逃命去了。</p>
<p>火球落到重慶市中心。烈火一縷縷地升起，滿天都是黑煙，紅色的火照耀着重慶，房屋連　地坍倒，人在呼喊着，火順着風燒，滿天飛着的木屑，比放燄火的火花還要多，一條街一倏街地燃燒着大火，紅光照着重慶比白大還亮，最繁榮的商業街道：都郵街，柴家巷，蒼坪街，新豐街，七星岡，都成了火龍。紅色的火成一條火河，全重慶成了火海。</p>
<p>人們在搶救者商品，行李，箱籠，貨物，担架隊，和各機關各團體組織的臨時救護隊在救護着負傷的同胞，和婦孺，在火海裏已燒得焦黑的屍身一具一具地被抬出。</p>
<p>未被延及的街道充滿着行李，箱　，商品，老太太和婦女們坐在所搶出來的一些零亂什物上，眼望着×人放的火把幸福快樂的家庭變成灰燼。入們沒有一個哭泣的，就是女人和兒童也沒有一個人落淚的。人們憤怒的烈火比×人的火燄還髙。每個人都咬着牙。在火光　天的夜晚誓死要報這血火的大仇。</p>
<p>商務印書館重慶分館完全被燒燬了，大公報，新華日報燒着了，四川省銀行辦事處，中國國貨公司，國泰飯店，郵政局，以及無數的商店，無數的幸福家庭都被繞燼了，德國領事館也被日本法西斯××拋下了燃　彈德領事館完全燒光，巧得很，祗留下一幅白色窗簾在隨風飄着，法領事館，英領事館都着了火。這就是×人在當日夜晚廣播說的。。『以軍事委員長行營爲目標從事大轟炸，將各軍事機關全部粉碎，獲預期以上之戰果。」</p>
<p>日本法西斯××放完了大火狂笑着，想互慶祝這摧殘人類的暴行。火從五四燃燒到五五，直至五六的深夜還在燃燒着。負傷的都擁滿在醫院：佳黑的屍體由火塲中一具具地抬出，街道上堆集的屍身男的女的老的少的成年的在一起，兒童在一起，堆得同大山小山一樣髙，這血仇火債能不報嗎？中國人是决不能再看這暴×在世界横行的。</p>
<p>全市人民極合理地疏散起來。災民開始登記。在災區發着麵包饅首。蔣委員長親下手諭全市無論公私大小汽車一槪集中起來，專爲疏散市民而用，由城內向城外法的市民，被集中的汽車無代價運輸到所想到的近村。從深夜到黎明，一直到天明，人不斷地疏散着。</p>
<p>不斷地在掘火場，屍身地被掘出，市內到處都是死屍，人們忙於救護，搶救，重慶十家報館，大都被　燒燬，暫進地由中央日報，大公報，時事新報，掃蕩報，新蜀報，新民報，西南日報，商務日報，國民公報出聯合版，新華日報在艱苦奮　中出着半張報市內的式作完全移到了市外。</p>
<p>重慶的火，經過了五十幾小時地燃燒，漸漸熄滅了。然而中國人民憤恨日本法西期××的心頭的火焰是永遠熄不了的。　五月七日晨</p>
<p>全桂新聞界　血誓　電慰渝同業　募捐救難胞</p>
<p>（桂林通訊）在上月廿九日，由育年新聞記者學會桂林分會召集的一　民精神總動員」座講會上，决定爲響　實行精神總動員，定五月九日舉行全桂林新聞從業員的國民抗×公約宣誓，並藉以紀念五九。</p>
<p>因此昨日下午三時至五時，在省黨部禮堂。由靑年記者學會桂林分會主持，集桂林所有新開從業員分作兩次舉行國民抗×公約宣誓。</p>
<p>三時不到，本報同人，並工友和印刷工友廿餘人，首先到達宣警地點，接着廣四日報的一律制服的男女同志，雙行列隊雄糾糾的到了，隨後又是列雙行的雜色夏衣的國際縱隊（國際新聞社）到了。接着大公報，新華日報，掃蕩報，中央社，記者學會南方　事處，華僑記者團的同志們都先後到達。這裏　大部分會員，但也有非會員和印刷工友和工友。</p>

<p>日崇禧將軍　獅吼　我們要以行動　答覆×人侵略</p>
<p>（桂林通信）當籠着這山城的朝霧還沒有退去的淸晨七時，大街上十字路間的空口，　着大幅藍布的　語，醒目的寫着白色大字，『紀念五九國恥，要實行國民精神總動員」，有幾家機關和開了門的商店，懸出了半懸的國務成千的武裝同志，公務人員，學生生……列隊向公共體育場去，</p>
<p>場中臺前，橫布上寫着：「廣西各界五九國恥紀念大會一，接着播音機開邕廣佈大聲的的清晣的救亡歌曲，贡色武裝，灰色藍色制服的行列，逐漸將廣場中間的空隙塡補起來。台上，贡主席，李夫人以及各界代表到了，接着大會主席白主任在全場的敬禮中走到臺上。一月餘各戰場的奔波，確使他清瘦了些，但仍不減少他挺拔的精神和莊嚴的威　。在奏樂聲中。大會開始。</p>
<p>白主任致開會詞，先略講五九的歷史。接着講今年紀念『五九』的意義：「自從訂立二十一係寺起一直到現在，敵人對我侵略，沒有不是根據那苛　條約的要點。抗戰的　發，給×日以猛烈的打擊，今抗戰進入第二階段，我距　紛碎這種束縛的時候愈近了。今日紀念五九必需要以加緊法戰來紀念。首先，我們要堅持持久戰和展開全面戰，抗戰勝利不單取决於行精神總動員，實施經濟反對鎖。據我最近由各戰場視察所得，×顯然是越戰越弱了，又　最近由日返國的人講，廿二個月來的戰爭。反决在日本人民生活上，是深刻的苦痛。戰爭打去了他們的皮鞋，領帶，和女人的　子，再打下去，他們的生命也　被消滅了最後勝利的不遠—其次，我們要加緊緊好鋤作。第三，國際的和平勢力一天天增强，我們要力爭國際的正義作爲我國抗戰勝利的援助……」最後非常沉重的說：『雪恥—　恥—非形式紀念會和口說可能了事，必需用行動來表現，』隨後大家熱烈的髙呼口號，表示大家的决心。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c2">日本最近的××冒險 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>××不覊的日本侵略者，現在似已走到了進退徬徨的末期而步入開始　　的第一步了。</p>
<p>在這時期中，侵略者的掙扎自不得不帶上特殊的姿勢。我們可以在侵略者對華的政略與戰略，及其對第三國的外交政策上，窺看出來。日本對華的作戰，陸蚩死傷很多，据確息，傷亡當近於九十多萬人，膠着於各戰塲的兵數也有百餘萬人，隨着戰塲的擴大，侵略者陸軍的分配，已感到十分的困難。但是侵略者旣無法於收拾這個戰局，自然圖謀再來迴光返照幾下。於是各大城市慘絕人寰轟炸開始了。重慶以次各都市遂先遭受了摧殘。他們發動無恥的漢奸四出活動，也是爲着這種慘殺的響應。</p>
<p>侵畧者對第三國的外交，也已感到束手無策，平沼內閣所宣佈的「親和外交」已經完全碰了壁　雖說重光葵還在倫敦試探英國的態度，以為調整英日關係的張本，但自其大勢看，日本軍閥已經焦灼起來了。色厲內荏的日本外交姿態，遂繼天津租界及上海租界　　　　　　，而悍然在鼓浪嶼登陸，企圖佔領這個各國的公共租界。這依然是種恐嚇與試探，但是侵略者的野心確已相當顯露。</p>
<p>日本最近的與論，特別是代表軍部意識的幾家報紙，如「國民新聞」，及「讀賣新聞」，對於中日戰爭的新局勢，作過客觀的分析，並提出具體的主張。他們認爲處理中日大戰的新階段，需要新的辦法。他們認爲支持中國强硬抗戰的力量有兩方面，其一於英美法蘇等第三國的積極援助：其二是以三民主義爲基幹的中國國民精神的堅强。對付第三國的　策有二，協調與蠻幹。他們主張協調的前途已很少希望，只好採用蠻幹的辦法。這次鼓浪嶼的佔領是對第三國蠻幹的更高一層的作法。倘若鼓浪嶼的嘗試成功，則第三國的租界不消說，卽其在華的權益，將完全爲侵略者所掃蕩。其次侵略者爲動搖我國抗戰精神而發動出賣靈魂的漢奸，大肆其政治文化的活動。　　　確實到了上海，魚兵蝦將也已在　　　　　佈置起他們的迷魂陣了。</p>
<p>對於漢奸的活動，我們的政府和人民自有鋤奸的辦法，他們的煽惑在受過二十二個月磨練的國民，也不會發生效力。只是對第三國的蠻幹就需要第三國適當而有效的措置了。最近日本讀賣新聞社評稱：日本政府對第三國的方策已得一定論，卽溫和的手段不足以解决公共租界問題，政府覺有對公共租界施以外科手術的必要。日本外相有田更稱：因爲「英美態度頑强」，故已决定採取强硬步驟，以解决上海公共租界問題。這更可證明我們的推論非無根據。於此，第三國更需要積極而有效的辦法了。對於鼓浪嶼問題的態度，英美各國皆已相當注意，但除美國比較積極外，截至現在尙無更進一步的表示。成千成萬的中國同胞已處於隨便殘殺與拘捕的環境下，但這不僅僅是中國的災害喲！</p>

<p>— 閔廉（寄自芒市）</p>
<p>「這山上的花兒眞美麗啊，</p>
<p>我希望得一個花兒樣的人兒，</p>
<p>可是呀，</p>
<p>我總是找不到這樣的一個。』女的囘唱</p>
<p>「這山上的花兒眞美麗呀，</p>
<p>可惜我不是花兒樣的人兒；</p>
<p>可是呀，</p>
<p>我却希望有人來和我共話。男的再唱：</p>
<p>「你確是美麗得像這花兒，</p>
<p>眞的呀，</p>
<p>若是你不拒绝我的話，</p>
<p>我願前來陪你共話，下面還有，記不淸了，不過唱到這裏，大體是决定了。還有一些山歌。是以月亮爲喩，描寫着自己之長單寂寞，也是唱得很多。但是外傅夷民　交之說，據久住那裏的人解釋，並不如此。所謂亂交的一批，不是普通家庭的女子，而是土司衙門裏的婢女。因爲每個士可衙門，總買有三四十或五六十不等的婢女供侍候，她們的待遇很苦。每到秋收之時，靑年男子大　袋中有幾個羅比，這時候她們上山，一則弄幾個小錢用用，再則解决性的苦悶。只有她們，是比較容易二唱即合的。其他，寡婦也有這種行爲：但一般的靑年男女，他們雖公開求愛，但考盧期間很長，尤其夷民重誓約，决不苟合成事。</p>
<p>公共事業</p>
<p>在邊境區域裏的公共事，可說完全沒有，勉强要說，那只是一些寺廟，幾塊公共的坟地，和幾個不完全的學校，沒有公共衞生設備，沿路猪狗亂撞，牛馬　狼藉，沒有醫院和醫藥，夷民病了只是拜神祭鬼一，和用一些毫無把握的土法子，本來不一定要死的，</p>
<p>却慢慢地看他死去，每個土司家裏有兩個緬甸某醫學　校的練習生當看　，她們也會打打防疫針之類，但收價奇貴，一般夷民毫不問津，除了幾個不完全的小學校之外，夷民毫無享受文化敎育的機會，前次內地派人去映些科學電影之類，看的夷民滿街滿巷，可見夷民求知之切。有得於公眾的公共建築，一點沒有。你隊了看見污濁的街道與貼滿牛糞大餅子（用以當柴燒）的土墻以外，一無可以欣賞的東西。</p>
<p>民族意識</p>
<p>夷民的民族意識，雖然被遺棄了幾百年之久，但對於漢族，對於中國，他們還是十分熱情，在從前，他們只知道有一個土司，但今天，他們已知道，在土司之上，還有雲南省的省政府，還有蔣委員長，還有整個中華民國。特別最近，我們在邊界上的運輸繁忙，這昜激動他，許多夷民，他們巳知道我們中國和日本帝國主義在拚命了，他們很忠實地在帮助築公路，很興奮地在帶助搬運貨物，夷兵，也和中國兵一樣忠勇，擎起槍桿，在白天，在黑夜，毫無懈怠地在捍衞着我們抗戰的財富，就是多土司，在從前，由於異邦人引誘，以致對中國漠視，但從抗戰以來，他們的觀感一轉，我想，這是我們爭取他們到內綫來，共同爲大中華民族之解放而努力的最好時機。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>在抗戰後方，在國防邊疆綫上，站着這幾千幾萬的夷族同胞。他們的一舉一動，他們的一衣一食，都應當引起我們的注意：怎樣去瞭解他們複雜的民族性；怎樣去應用他們本能的　悍結實來組織成抗戰的力量；怎樣適宜地但是勇敢果斷地去改造　們現有的不健全的社會制度和行政機構，怎樣有計劃　去組織與訓練他們原有有武裝力量，來發展成爲巨大的邊疆上的國防力量；怎樣主動地果斷地去解决許多外交糾紛；怎樣帮助他們開發經濟來改善他們的日常生活；怎樣帮助他們發展公共事業來改善他們現有　惡劣的生活環竟。怎樣利用他們原有的好的風　習慣和語言。文字與教育的基礎，去提髙他們的文化水準，和由此來緊張他們的大中華民族圑結一致，抵抗侵略的意織。這些問題，今天賢明的抗×政府，賢明的專家與學者，忠實的抗戰與救亡的團體與機關，和全國　國同胞，都應把它放在議事日程上給予，迅速的討論和執行。中華民族是整個的，今天，我們的　人只有一個目本××××××××××××××！</p>

<p>【中央社重慶十六日電】蔣委員長爲防制×機轟炸，頃發表吿各省市政府興全國同胞書。其全文如下，本月以來，×機狂炸吾全國各地平民住宅區域，已有五十餘次。只就重慶一市而言，前後被炸死傷之同胞，總數已以千計，此外除福州，西安，洛陽，襄樊，以及湘鄂贛前方各處，受其慘炸不計外，其他本無軍事設備之城市，亦非車事機關所在之地區，例如泉州，長汀，瓊州，韶關，龍溪，同安，汕頭，寧波，金華，衡陽，芷江，沅陵，漢中等地，亦無不横遭轟襲，備受傷夷。血僑遍地，火光流天，慘毒之狀，罄竹難書。×寇每謂其所轟炸者，祇限軍事設備之區；此種可鄙之謂言，卑劣之慣技，巳爲中外所週知，豈能掩飾其野蠻狂暴之罪惡？</p>
<p>×機狂炸　目的有三</p>
<p>×機之所以猛炸吾平民者，其目的不外乎三點：其一，欲以不斷的轟炸，威脅吾全國民衆抗戰之精神，希冀吾同胞向之屈膝投降；其二，欲以猛烈的轟炸，斷絕吾同胞之生活，企圖吾同胞于流離失所之中，减少生產，影響我抗戰之前途；其三，欲以集中的轟炸，妨害我社會之安寧，妄想擾亂吾後方之秩序。—×人抱此三種目的，而又深知我救國之基礎，全在民眾，故彼欲滅亡我民族。必先斷絕吾民命。此其轟炸燒殺，所以必選擇吾平民密集之區，不特重慶一地爲然，其他各處，亦莫不皆然。而其未來殘酷之獸行，必比今日爲尤甚。</p>
<p>橫遭兇暴　何以報復</p>
<p>吾全國同胞横　兇暴，明燭毒謀，亟應有以防制而報復之，茲陳三事，以告同胞；（一）抗戰軍興，將及二年，吾國民氣之振奮，精神之團結，超越前古，振驚世界，×人見之，以爲若不恣其　性，逞彼兇殘，則其侵略之計已窮，崩潰之勢立致，於是，半月之內，盲目狂炸，慘無人道，歷　人世間未有之浩劫。吾同胞兩年以來受其荼毒，本已見怪不驚，而于最近遭受如此之狂炸，仍能鎭　如常，行所無事，此種精神，巳足褫×魄而制毒計，益以各級政府，憂勤惕勵，全力防護，舉凡消極積極設施，今已日臻完備，以後不僅不患其不斷之轟炸，而且必使其徒勞虛擲，消耗殆盡，以粉碎其所挾第一之目的。</p>
<p>一日抗戰　死中求生</p>
<p>惟吾同胞應知：×人以後之所轟炸者，决非限於一城一市，而其目的，則在吾全國城市和整個之民族，至於政府及軍事設備之處，雖屢遭轟炸，而損失無幾，以其有所戒懼也。此於過去轟炸之事實，不敢在我軍事設備地區施行低空擲彈，可以證之，反之，凡我無軍事設備各處，則隨時隨地，皆受其濫施狂炸，漫無忌彈。由此吾人因知：我國如不能積極充實武力，抗戰到底，則必致全國繳械，行將任其屠殺，束手待斃，如此×燄更烈，危亡立至，不僅我現代之同胞，將聽其宰割，且使吾民族世世子孫，萬刦不復矣。故吾全國同胞，於此更應堅定抗戰到底之决心，方能達成死中求生之目的，深信我民埃必能於此慘炸飲痛之中，刻骨銘心，念念不忘此深仇大恨，以終此身，以傳於後世子孫，直至殲×滅寇，爲吾死難同胞復仇雪恥而後巳。</p>
<p>二日下鄉　發展農村</p>
<p>（二）政府在發表市民疏散令以前，本巳着手于必要之準備，而農村本爲我國民生活之泉源，膏沃之壤，可耕可讀，簡樸之室，可息可作，環市鄰邑之鄉村，何止百萬？只要每家收容一人，卽巳舉市歸之而有餘。惟我市民之入鄉者，皆應嚴守政府之規律，重感各鄕同胞愛護之熱情：有技術者，當協助農村之發展；受敎育者，常敎養農民之子弟，互惠互助，共苦共甘，如此則不特市民有所安息，而農村亦將爲之蓬勃。此雖爲一時避難之計，亦建國之基；蓋必勝必成全在於　人之農村，充實農村，發展生產，卽所以奠立國本，增强國力，今因×機不斷之肆虐，以樹立我建國之宏規，則×人所挾之第二目的，不惟因之而粉碎，而我建國之大業，且得因之而實現。惟此所當注意者，一面固應積極疏散，而一面仍應加强組織，以强固我抗戰精神之堡壘，如此縱傾×機之全力，不斷來襲，而於我國土地之廣，鄉鎮之多以視之，直無異於太倉之一粟耳。故我城市同胞鄕居以後，×計必窮，更無所施其技矣。</p>
<p>三日防護　上下合作</p>
<p>（三）留於城市之居民，各級政府，固應竭其全力防護，例如開折火巷，堆積沙包，預蓄水量，澈底實施，以盡職責；凡我市民，亦須確遵功令，努力不懈。則充×機之全力，縱使其彈無不中，亦一彈祗能毀我一宅空室，而屋巷多，避災更易，在×旣得不償失，在我則永免連廛被災之苦。其他城市，皆應如重慶市區積極統制，避彈有定濠，進退有崗位，劃一盤齊，籌備妥善。如留於城市者，危險日少；下鄕者生活得所，心竟旣安。乃相與共同工作，各就崗位，無一人不在規律之中，無一人無工作之地，以後×機必不斷來襲，且必集中轟炸，如我同胞能依一切規度以進退，則必能處變如常，不至再多無謂之損失，各級政府，更須督屬意警官兵，以及各公務人員與地方之保甲長，全體發動，勵行其職權，勿使社會之秩序，略受不良之影響。如此則×之第三目的，又爲我粉碎無遺矣。</p>
<p>總觀全局　勝券在握</p>
<p>茲就整個戰事之經過，特爲吾同胞一吿之。今日×軍日暮途遠，圖窮匕現之眞形，更於此二十二個月之戰事以證之。蓋自七七開戰以來，×傾其全國之力，冀求一逞于我，而我軍奮起抗戰，百戰不衰。至今戰爭之全局；北戰場我軍尙在　溝橋平津察綏之東北地區，再接再厲，奮勇無前；東戰塲我軍仍在　濟京滬滬杭一帶，馳驅縱横，攻守自如；南戰場我軍猶在廣九廣三路綫，積極進攻，迭克重鎭。而開封安慶等省城，雖巳爲×竊據一年之久者，至今不僅爲我軍所控制，巳屬爲我軍所攻取。此後倫陷地區各重鎭，其攻守取舍，亦必權自我操，此爲古今中外，自有民族戰爭以來，凡抵禦侵略者之鬥爭，未有如今日之奇蹟者也。反觀×軍之現狀，不僅其深陷泥淖，受我節簡之腰擊，實已困　我重重大包圍之中，其危險窘迫之情景，當非局外人知其萬一者。此又古今中外之戰史所罕見者也。至我民志之堅决，經濟之安定，致勝諸條　，茲姑不舉，以此廿二月所經過之戰况，以及×我優劣之態勢，而衡量將來之戰局，已足證明我國最後之勝利，如操左券。</p>
<p>×機獸行　何足道哉</p>
<p>夫以×人自豪於世界者，惟其所訓練多年之陸軍也，而乃一遇我軍之抵抗，其經過之紀錄，不過如此，則其空軍全部之總兵丈，不過區區二千架之飛機，尙何足道？故充×機之力，衹能馳突我二千州縣之城市，斷不能燬滅我九千萬戶之鄕村；祇能殺傷我猝不及避之生命，斷不能搖撼我四萬五千萬同胞同仇×愾之精神。自古以來，我民族不屈不擠之正氣，常因異族入寇而更爲之發揚，稽諸歷史，炳若日星，忠臣志士所以臨難不苟視死如歸者，皆秉此民族傳統之精神。遠之如揚州十日，嘉定三屠；近之如五三濟南之慘案，及此次南京內城之被屠，皆在火光血泊之中，炳　我民族精神之史　。至其空軍之獸行浪擲。不特不能撼動吾民族抗戰精神之毫末，且信吾民族人格之鍛鍊，行見於斯而益精，團結因之而益增，國基亦因之益固。且知×機今日狂炸我國之創痛，必造成其自飲殺人之彈，最近之報應，不觀其國內東京，西京，大阪，福岡，福井千棄等處之兵工廠化學廠，皆已次　爲其　戰之軍民。不斷的作有計劃之　炸乎？</p>
<p>茍有人心　能勿奮起</p>
<p>綜上以言，×機此次到處狂炸之行爲，固殘忍可恨，而其奇窘可知，吾同胞之摟其彈者或血肉糜爛，或家室爲墟，苟有人心，能無憫惻？復念吾同胞之在淪陷區者，男爲×人　使束縛，女受×軍之逼害汚辱，仰伺人顏，俯私飲泣，如入檻押，如陷囹圄，求生不獲，拚死不能，凡諸苦痛，已倍蓰于我今日空襲下之同胞。其尤甚者，强迫我們同胞服其毒藥，注其毒針，不特使我自殺其身，並且強我自滅其種，凡此吾同胞所受倍蓰于轟炸之慘狀，吾人若不共同一致，急圖報復，此不共戴天之仇恨，曷能慰吾神明？而我各省市地方政府，尤應遵照中央之規定，指導民衆，切實執行，竭盡救護之職責，以周吾同胞之不給，與助吾同胞之所不及更望吾國軍民，自今以後，倍增團結誓死雪恥，親愛精誠，共報國仇，樹立我民族生存獨立永久之基業！完成吾抗戰建國偉大之使命！</p>

<p>上海同胞畢竟有骨氣有胆量，他們善於適應環境進行一切愛國救國支持抗戰的工作，並且善於在困苦危險之中以大無長精神爭取正義自由的出路。譬如這次租界當局，在日方無理威脅下採取屈服辦法，而上海同胞則一面堅决並擴大反日運動，一面還以最適當的方法，理直氣壯地抗議租界當局的屈辱政策（見中央社十五日電「日在租界擅自綁架，滬各團體聯台抗議」）。雖然租界問題有待於英美法各國對日制裁的切實施行始能根本解决，但是公共租界工部局董事長樊克令氏已因此向領團抗議日軍最近在租界的暴行了！</p>
<p>上海同胞這種艱苦鬥爭的精神，是中華民族偉大人格的表現，也是中華民族終將戰勝其×人的根據，然而那些處境遠較上海爲優，×××××××××××××××××。而竟以自悔自辱為快的份子。看到中華民國團民幾個字，應該知所慚愧罷！</p>

<p>在這種形勢之下，我們要緊緊把握住每一個推進英法美各國援華制日運動的機會！</p>
<p>十五日英下院再度展開了關于遠東局勢的討論，在這討論中不僅反映了全英國民衆反抗日本×行的熱情，並且史明顯更激烈地表現了掌握政治權威的份子的援華制日的熱情。英國商務部長還鄭重表示中英工業合作，英政府決予贊助。</p>
<p>這種情形當然不僅在英國是如此—卽據路透社十七日倫敦電，亦稱英國政界均認國聯會議將有可能通過進一步援助中國的提案！</p>
<p>然而，我們的努力在那裏呢？我們的國民外交運動在那里呢，我們的與論界的動員在那裏呢？抗戰建國正臨於新的難苦階段，我們要赶快圑結一致，援動政府，把握時機，力爭外援，以與國內軍事政治與經濟建設的進步相配台。而予日×以更大的致命的打擊！</p>

<p>— 煥堂</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>使略的烽火，　醒了幾百年來的睡獅之夢，民挨目衛抗爭的怒潮，湧起了碧空雲　，每個炎黃革胄的孝子賢孫，爲着國家獨立生仔，為着正義　動熱情，他們都已道接間接地竭盡忠誠準備性了小我一切，而從事於神聖戰閒了·</p>
<p>而今，抗戰已轉入有利的新階段，中華民族爲應付與實現這個艱苦的過渡時期，接近最後勝利的自由幸福世界，除了更努力地，更艱苦地，把一切的一切力量，献於前方，作爲抗戰的後盾外，而今，在最髙領袖將委員長的領導之下，更來一個國民精神的總動員，把精神配合物質，—它就是中國今後抗爭的一支更有力的洪流，這支洪流；從華南？華西。展到華東，　北，流過鴨綠江，冲到富士山，</p>
<p>澳門—它因爲政治的特殊關係，戰農掀開後，在華南可算是一個安全的地帶了，然而，僑胞們的情緒，大部份，幸還沒有給到安全的薰染，而埋沒了他底赤子之心，過去有着的不少的精神物質，獻囘祖國去，祖國對這一位　零海外的孤兒，當然也感到片見的總藉吧。</p>
<p>這裏，四界救災會就是其中的一個代表了，現在它更爲着響應國民精神動員，特於日昨在對海灣仔，灣仔小學，來一個國民公約宣誓，事前經該會會員奔走照應後，當日到場的數百人，有的是學生，是該會的會員，和澳門的僑胞等，經濟一場，氣慨萬千，這祖國的一羣，是中華民族政治進步的縮影，是爭取最後勝利的有力基石。</p>
<p>一所髙低可仰，而又佈置　齋的小學校中，門前橫着一面紅字的白額，倍德着抆地前幾技　靑的老槐，紅綠相映搖曳春風。禮堂內坐着一群優秀有為的男女靑年，秩序幷然，壯重無聲，經過行禮如儀後；首由主席宣　　會理由，次至中國國民黨駐澳直屬支部代表監誓員致　　後。繼之又由各界代表次等演講，每個人都情詞，激勵。意義深長人們的心靈，眞是魂離軀壳，早己馳向多難的祖邦去了。在　穆　緊　空氣中，為着竭盡忠誠，捷護祖國，於是便開始宣誓國民公約了·</p>
<p>全場的人　立起來，舉首右手，首由主席宣讀誓詞，繼之朗誦公約，大家異口同音，聲如金石，最後，由各界代表卽席揮毛，共鑒公鈞，—中華民族的最後勝利，它確是一個有力的保證。</p>
<p>晚上該會的同志，仍是餘興未盡「在那裏更舉行一個野火大會，在千百羣衆圍看的一塊空地中，一羣男女靑年依彥，他們正在凖備着把有意義的文宇，來表現於動作，發揚抗戰的大義了，游藝秩序，歌唱的，計有流亡第一二三部，犧牲已到最後關頭，救亡進行曲等。表演的計有起來兒童劇社的「××××」，「××××」。中靑服務團的「東北吼聲」「耆羅音樂」「我們的家鄕」等，其中尤以「東北吼聲」一約，更爲發人心省，激動　情，當時全場的空氣，鴉雀無聲，大約觀衆的情緒，是受刺激太深吧。直至深夜十一左右，一羣同志，才抱緊着强的心緒散會而歸。</p>

<h3 id="c35">救亡團體的模範者　「中救」的組織與生活 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>嚴密，嚴肅，貢獻一切於民族解放鬥爭！</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團在讀者的印象中終不會陌生　。</p>
<p>他們緊接　民族解放鬥爭的禮砲，奔走南北東西，不知鼓舞了多少前線的將士與後方的同胞！</p>
<p>他們。將赴南洋一帶宣慰　胞。用國內的眞憑實據　證　最後勝利的絕對有把握，僑胞過去的出　出力，一點亦不會白費，並將　欵五卡萬元，建立二十所傷兵收容站，十所傷兵醫院——所文化供應站；十所殘廢二人，陣亡將士家屬，出征軍人家屬的習藝所·</p>
<p>他們，應本港各界賑聯會之邀，在出國之前爲該　作一次大規模的義演，自本月廿五日起，一連三晚在利鐸台公演，『保衛祖國」，「民族萬　』，及『台兒莊之春』等名劇，佈景及燈光由「中救」負責，共費港幣三千餘元，爲本港空前之盛舉。</p>
<p>關於這些，這些，本報經已有詳細的報　，這裏所要介紹的，就是中國　亡劇團的組織和生活。</p>
<p>本着民主宅義的精神，全體大會是最髙的權力機關，每週舉行一次。理事會是執行機關亦是每週舉行一次，理事會之下的祖織及人選就是：圑長金山，副團長王瑩。秘書兼研究部長　知微，總務部長白　，劇務部長劉丹靑，宣傳部長伍禾，電影部長徐　山。理事會理事七人，田正副團長及各部部長組織之，團長爲主席。總務部分會計，事務，文書，衛生等投。劇務部分道具，服裝，化裝，提示，燈光，裝置，效果等股。宣傳部分編輯委員會（三人）及聯絡，美術，出版等股。硏究部分蒐集，時事，調査，研讀，習作等股。電影部分攝影，照相，洗印，保管等股。以上各部還各設幹事若干人襄助一切，盡量運用分工合作的原則使事事有人做。人人有事做，囘顧一般的團體亦未嘗不是「照例」類似這樣的組織，可是「事在人爲」效果却有不同，</p>
<p>組成『中救」的人才是怎樣呢？讀者一定馬上就喚起金山，王瑩，林樞，范政的記憶，是的，這四位是象徵着人無分男女老小的全民抗戰的意思。（林樞先生雖然並不老，但是，以他的閱歷及年齡，在團體中分明是長者，稱他為「老單」亦禾嘗不可）但是，其他的伏伴，亦都是精明能幹，多才多藝的專門人才。記者看他們有的在裝置電器，有的在攝製影片，有的在製作佈景與道具，有的在　稿寫文章……濟濟一羣，都是團體少不得的幹才。</p>
<p>他們的生活，圑體經費是由同情他們的政　長官及熟心朋友捐助的。每人每月只發零用費三元，如果露體經濟困難，還得折扣或「欠薪」。一切　作自己當，現在他們還是輪流煮飯。這種享受與過去當明星或大學生活是完全相反的；可是，他們受了英勇將士與廣大同胞的感化，深深覺　這樣的生活才是「中國的」生活，才是有生命，有靈魂的生活，亦是象徵中華民族有光榮前途的生活。小資產階級及知識階級在生活形　上的突變，劣根性的克服，是抗戰以來一個可歌可頌的進步現象。「中救」朋友就是很多進步靑年羣衆中的一部份</p>
<p>他們每天的生活，七時至七時三十分是晨會，內容有時事報吿，閱讀報吿，生活檢討，及工作佈置。接着就是，閱讀及小組討論會。午餐後，就是辦公與排戲。晚上是自由　作。要不是星期日，團員是不能離開圑體外出的。現在。因爲忙於籌備公演，連星期日亦取銷丁。無論是在前綫，或是在香港，他們老是集體的工作，集體的敎育。</p>
<p>他們團體有約法三章：（一）只有圑體行動，沒有個人行動，生死甘苦共之；（二）一切對內外事務絕對公開；（三）謝絕一切與工作無關之公私宴會。還有四句格言是：工作緊張，生活嚴意，經濟淸楚，熊度純正。</p>
<p>記者細細體察他們的生活，深深覺得這公約與信條，完全表現在他們的實生活中。當他們在晨會的時候，不必要的羅酬，是擱在一邊的。大家練習國語，學習注音符號的精神，眞像中小學生一　可愛，就是林樞先生，亦跟着「後生』，練習矯正他不正確的發音、說說笑笑，融融樂樂，眞使旁觀者不勝羨慕之至。</p>
<p>平常的時候，團長金山亦跟大家二樣，大家亦稱他「老金』—「老金」—可是，念台詞戒排戲如有不妥的地方，　却很疋經地吿訴伙伴們，熊度很嚴　，亦很自然。大家如遇有問題，亦很客氣地請敎他，彼此之間，都是眞情的流露。</p>
<p>昨天晚上，記者看他們化裝拍照及怖置後台那相親愛精誠的情形越是教人感動，有的，是　着大雨到宿舍取衣服，公事放在自己的肩磅上，化裝，我帮忙你，你帮忙我，事情是大家的，因爲是澈夜拍照，累了的朋及隨處就躺着，經過的朋友怕他着了凉，就　他蓋上二件衣衫，同舟共濟，比兄弟姊據還要來得親蜜，記者看了很多圑體，條「中救』一樣的却很少見，在滿心髙興爲讀者報道之後，謹於文末，願靑年朋友學習他們的徬樣；願他們爲國珍重，好好工作着；好好生長起來。</p>

<h3 id="c57">旭和杯究竟屬誰　南華海軍再決戰　今天下午四時半在加山會師　梁榮照黎兆榮足傷已愈可以上陣 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>（本報專訊）夏日炎炎似火燒、原不適宜於足球劇烈運動、故總會所舉辦的五項錦標賽、在去月底已結束了、</p>
<p>惟旭和杯懸而未决、還須今天在加山舉行錦標爭奪戰、而本星期六又有南華與港聯的義賽、所以、在此期內、球事將闌實未　、</p>
<p>上星期六原爲解决旭和杯誰屬之期、惟因南華球人有數名足部負傷、未克以完整的陣綫應戰、遂波海軍打成各一和局、這光榮之物、當日『妾身未分明』、乃有今天再决雌雄之舉、</p>
<p>會戰地點、仍在加山、下午四時半開始、如賽足七十分鐘、猶未分勝負、决加時再賽、因南華出發南遊期近、不得再延擱了、</p>
<p>聽說梁榮照和黎兆榮、足傷已愈、今天可以上陣、所以編排的陣綫、比上次的較爲完整、而海軍方面、因兵艦一簡號』已離港、故前鋒綫中、少却摩氏一人、準此以觀、南華實力增强、海軍則减弱、相與較置、南華勝利希望殊髙、</p>
<p>先把兩陣排列、再談其他、</p>
<p>南華會</p>
<p>張榮才　李國威　李天生　劉慶才　梁榮照　郭英祺　楊水益　黎兆榮　馮景祥　葉北華　鄧廣森</p>

<p>海軍隊</p>
<p>狄架臣　韓尼威路　軒地　韓尼維路　加利亞　谷巴　　特　　　　　摩利士　拖般　岩土杜郎</p>
<p>旣有榮照居中堅、助攻助守之力、定然加增、又有兆榮在前線、進展亦較利銳、蓋南華七次所以未得勝利、乃因前線缺去兆榮、改用郭英祺、以致整個聯絡、未得盡致、此次有兆榮上陣、則各個合作工夫、必皆能盡量發揮、以圖取勝利、</p>
<p>兆榮旣參戰、英祺則調任左前衞、他够爽辣、又善傳供、與右方的劉慶才、有異曲同工之妙、則掩護之下、可使前線各員、得到合口胃的供球、定更活躍、</p>
<p>李國威代麥紹漢之職以來、越演越佳、是改變作風後顯然的淮步、</p>
<p>今天南華前進時的戰略、殊不可採用中央突破法、蓋馮景祥盤運則佳妙、衝擊非所長、若採此法、實不得體、且海軍正前　谷巴、工夫老練、善走位置、又不好出擊的人、其責任助守多於助攻、故景祥應運用靈活的脚頭、引誘谷巴出來、削弱他防衛力、然後進一步施以旁敲側擊、左右夾攻、那就不愁進攻不克了、</p>
<p>但南華左翼仍用楊水益而不用雜斗文、削足就履、似非得宜、聽說不用斗文的原因、是嫌他太過輕忽責任、得球到腳、旣無適台的切傳、又沒成就的盤運、失機會多於造機會。所以、便仍用水益祖任、但望水益今天的演出、莫再像得上次不滿人意、才不負選拔者一片心</p>
<p>總之、若南華能以上列陣線應戰、必定勝利、包辦錦標的創作、自可完成、假如又以後備員補充、而不以原陣對付、則取勝定不容易也。（球場太歲）</p>

<p>公開男子籃球甲組賽、星島出戰南華後、干昨夕舉行、以定冠軍誰屬、故雙方以生死關頭所在、拚命以赴、而一般球迷、亦各爲其所擁護之一隊、大肆吶喊、故一得一失之間、聲震屋瓦、在四十分鐘之劇爭、空氣無一息不在極度緊張中、結果南華以四十四比四十三之成績、以壓倒星島、而榮膺本屆之盟主、星島乃嘆緣慳矣、</p>
<p>南華之能具此戰績、固得力於全隊有會意之聯絡、而各該成員之努力不懈、不論在空間或時間、無一次肯輕易放過、石振智因被釘牢、雖未能盡露本色、但已盡其本責、陳新球帶球衝籃、猛勇無倫、造成本陰許多射籃之機、蔴傑民智勇兼全、能趨虛擊實、極爲出色、陸恩敬、石振達、屢將對方傳球奪獲、攖挫敵鋒、　以後衛之身、不迭直搗前方射球、其演出之佳、尤爲全隊冠、惜因此每爲李沛赤、梁國鐸乘虛攻入耳、然其全隊傳遞、均以短距離或躍地球出之、避免對方之截獲、且傳球之速度、能避免一切、復均以盤旋之置地、使對方無所捉摸、但擲球則仍久工失也、</p>
<p>星島梁國鑼之遠射、戴福誠、李沛赤之數度偷關籃底、建功不少、潘堯君、辛雅浪被釘甚牢、無法施其技、李沛炎本爲星島之能員　在昨戰祇出場片刻、殊令人不解、至全隊聯絡之佳、比南華實未　多鑲、其拍傳法尤爲足取、跳球籃底面擊、亦勝一籌、故其致敗、非技術不如人、乃因求勝之心過切、每有可乘機會、反不得手、如戴福成最後一分　得一罰球、竟不能命中、遂以一分之差　爲南華所敗、殊爲該隊呼不値也、</p>
<p>比賽過程、星島戴福成遠射首開紀錄、未幾、卽被南　以四比　及八比八打囘平手、再以十二比八佔先、嗣後雙方各有所獲、以十二、十六、及二十　駕齊驅、上半場吿　、甫華再以廿四比廿一佔先、易籃後、雙方打來有如起鵲落之妙、但南華一路盡佔上風、紀錄先後爲卅比廿五、卅三比廿五、卅五比廿六、至最後九分鐘時、星島雖　度迎頭趕上、演成卅七比四十一、及四十比四十三之局、戰至最後兩分、雙方且以四一三比四十三平分春色、後南華罰得一分、戴福成隨亦獲罰球、惜不中的、已而壁上時鐘、已鈴作響、南華遂于狂歡中髙呼凱旋、</p>

<p>— 陸善熾</p>
<p>八一三戰事以來、淪陷之區、盧舍爲墟、工商事業、多數受有影響、雖其損害程度、各有不同、但應亟謀救濟、以圖善後則一、本市奚玉書會計師、前曾爲此事、擬具意見、呈請經濟部鑒核、最近接到批覆、由奚會計師加具補充辦法、公開發表、一時工商事業、因鑑於切身利害關係之重大、莫不深切注意、熱烈討論、作者以聽對於戰事損失之處理、固應有一具體辦法、以賣遵循、但此項辦法之內容、應如何决定、實宜愼重考慮、以期周密、否則措置失當、將貼工商界以不良之影響、爰不揣陋、略實芻見、以爲商榷、</p>
<p>査此次奚氏提案及經濟部批示辦法之內容、以「將戰事損失作爲遲延資產、以逐年盈餘攤提抵補」一點、爲最重要、對於此項辦法、吾人以爲稍樣簡略。恐難以一律遵循、同時旣以戰事投失作爲遞延資產、復指定須以逐年盈餘、攤提抵補、亦覺於用語上、略嫌含混、蓋遞延資產一詞、原係會計上之專用名詞、依會計方法、對於遞延資產之攤提、必須在决算整理時行之、換言之、即須先將遞延資產之攤提額、列爲損費、而後算出純益、並非先行算出純益、而後從事於攤提、故如果以戰事祖失、作爲遞延資產辦理、則其撥提抵補、應不能從逐年盈餘中爲之；但如謂攤提抵補、果應在盈餘中爲之、則戰事損失、將不能作爲遞延資產處理、是以照原文字義上解釋、對於戰事損失、究應如何處理、實並未明瞭、】推就其以後所示攤提年限上之限制情形、加以推測、則似係指其攤提抵補、應在决算前行之者、蓋否則所得稅之計算、原係以純益爲標準、凡有盈餘卽當納稅、更何必顧及其攤提年限哉、以下請先就戰事損失是否可以作爲遞延資產處理一點、加以討論、</p>
<p>（一）會計學上遞廷賣產一網、係從英語DoferredAssets而來Deferred之字義解釋、原作延輾或延長講、會計上對於若干預付之費用、因其效益、有延輾至次年之可能、同時對於此項損、　事實上亦不應由本年負祖、故特暫時作爲資產、一則使其效益、可以延輾至次年、同時亦可以將本年度不應負祖之損費、轉嫁至次年、其意甚深、其法甚善、故如預付房租、預付保險費等之支出、在會計上、殆已確認其爲遞延資產之性質、但如對於開辦費、卽因於其效益延輾及應否轉嫁至次年負祖之點、不免發生疑義、故至今學者間意見、尙未能一致確認其爲遞延資產之一種、茲戰事損失、其發生焉、完全非於事前所能逆料、且發生之後、旣無效益可以延輾至次年、亦並無理由、可以主張必須由以後各年度分担、其爲確定之損失、而不能與預付費用、相提並論、其甚爲明顯、此就會計理論上、認爲有待商榷者一、</p>
<p>（二）任何事業、欲期健全發展、以謀資本充實爲唯一要　、充買資本之道、在積極方面、應有多量之公積、在消極方面、應無盧抬之財產、公司法上對於盈餘之分派、規定須提存公積、對於金錢外之財產出資、監視特嚴、對於股本之折價發行、懸爲禁令、與夫商人通例及所得稅法令上、對於財產估價、獎勵低價、均無非欲期事業之資本、趨於充實、茲就戰事損失而言、其原有財產、顯巳喪失、資本顯己虧蝕、但若仍令其在帳面上保留爲資產、顯於資本充實之原則、大相違背、恐其結果、對於目前之困難、未必即能藉此而緩和、但對於將來自力更新之企圖、反見大有危害、此就事業理財上、認爲有待商　者二、</p>
<p>（三）任何事業、如年終决算、結有盈餘、除須彌補　損、並提存法定公積外、股東例可要求派分股息、茲因戰事而受有損害之事業、若以損失列爲結轉之虧損、則在未彌補足額以前、縱令結有盈餘、依法股東不得要求派分股息、但如以之列爲遞延資產、勢必令本屬虧損者、仍可結爲盈餘、本應少結盈餘者、將可多結盈餘、因此股東卽得要求派分多量之股息、（蓋旣經承認損失可以作爲資產於前、卽不能限制股東要求派分股息於後、）然此項盈餘、本係盧結、若任其分派、勢必演成將本作息之現象、卽在平時、猶屬禁忌、况在事業基礎業巳脆弱之戰後、故以戰事損失作爲遞延資產之結果、正無　利用會計上之技巧、以公然違背法律上「無盈錄不得派分股息」之規定、此就法律觀點、認爲有待商榷者三、　（未究）</p>

<p>— 王坪</p>
<p>×人佔據下城市的剪影</p>
<p>碰見×人便得行禮，可是不能脚併攏手貼　。如果太規矩了，他說是中國兵，應該故意裝出像打拱也像鞠躬的鄉下佬，這樣。敵兵也許還會拍拍你的肩說，『良民良民』便放你過去，有的地方的敵哨兵，只要給他三四個鷄蛋，他便呌你，「渡！」</p>
<p>在城裏面，×人的盤　相當的　，可是不要緊，有眞正的良民掩　，同時在　城在自然也得率先準備準備，或者裝商人或者裝農夫，要是能　安徽話，那就更好，×兵盤査來踪去跡以後，一定會問，「有中國兵的？」「新四軍的有？」你搖搖　擺手說，『不曉得，我們住的地沒有』，或者故意說得。『多多的，大大的』，這一些牛頭不對馬嘴的話有時客棧（或行）的老板會說。他他是鄕下佬，知道甚麽，便過去了。總之，只要應付得法，不出亂子，把他抓住是沒有關係的，特別是現在×正採取「懷柔政策」。滿口的仁義道德，怎麼能再像過去那麽大燒大殺呢？因此，據×人自己的估計，在蕪湖城中我們活動的『便衣偵探』在兩千個以上，弄得他日夜不安，南京市特務機開也在此設了個「蕪湖班」，一方面訓練漢奸，一方面對付我們的「便衣偵探」。</p>
<p>蕪湖最繁榮的街仍然是中山路長街一帶，然而，所謂『繁榮』，　是人多，大的商店都沒有，除了×人開的甚麽洋行，甚麽會社外，最多是難民攝的小攤，在重軍的捐稅的剝削下替×人推銷日貨糊糊口而巳，可是生意也淸淡得復；之外，眞正繁榮的要算嫖及賭，差不多大的旅舘如，「大華」「中南」——等都是賭塲也都是妓館，更有公開的在漢奸報大登廣吿，招徠顧客的妓院，而且有純日本妓女的窰子，這些淪爲非人的妓女們，不單要供以肉體「慰勞」「皇軍」，而且每日要將賣肉　魂得來的血綫，議「皇軍」抽捐！最低的正式的「花捐」是二元，還有其他雜稅：如檢査費，同時「皇軍」想得更週到，要叫她們「受訓」，學習更能迷客的技巧，從『迷』裏面，探聽做了『皇軍』的耳目！</p>
<p>除了訓練娼妓爲偵探外，他們又將和尙尼姑從「佛門」中拉出，到「　世」來拿稀少的血腥綫二替菩薩的對頭——日本××做爪牙，達　衆生。眞是「罪過罪過」，×人之　略可稱是無所不用其極！</p>
<p>蕪湖僞縣長從前是朱逆　封，因爲他狗尾巴擺得慇勤，現在已升省委，×人聽說最近將委以『江南省』——京蕪一　，×人改爲「江南省」——省長之僞職。現任蕪湖縣長是汪逆子棟，爲『前淸進士』，他每次出遊，必有有大批日憲警「保護」。在「縣府」在「公館」　說也一樣，而其實是監視他，因此，他們除了怕中國　隊外，更　自己的主于，漢奸眞苦也！</p>
<p>×人爲了「繁榮」市面，紛飾太平起見，將幾間戲院恢復或更名或另造了，如佛光，光明兩戲院是放映電影的，影片則是「萬　之王」「兒女英雄」……之類的麻醉貨；還有花園大舞台，復興大舞台則專唱戲，戲院門口及僞報的廣告上均大書：「皇軍半價」「優待皇軍」或「歡迎皇軍入座」一類的字樣。</p>
<p>有幾條街是絕對禁止行人的，那就是×人的兵營及傷兵醫院所在地，他們的傷兵，不能隨便亂跑，第一是怕擾亂市面，第二是怕敵兵看見傷情；第三是怕我們探知他傷兵的確數而估計他的兵力，這些地方，可以說是敵人的優點！</p>
<p>提到傷兵，想起太年四月拾二晚上拾點鐘蕪湖谷倉的慘叫，那天天剛黑，敵人便下戒　令，不許任何行人通過，老百姓知道，一定又有重要的事情發生了，不一會，某小酒館中剛從九里山打敗下來在此吃飯的幾個經傷日本兵，被幾個日本　警拉起便走，傷兵要求他們讓他們「迷西迷西」（吃飯）再走，　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c68">石達開的詩 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>石達開的詩，太平天國詩文勞和盧冀野所輯的集子裏都很少，頗使讀者感到不足。另有許指熾所重編的「石達開日記」，據序文所云許指嚴曾「潤色其辭』，那末，這部日記是否眞的，或是潤色了幾分之幾，便都成爲問題了。</p>
<p>石達開大約曾做過不少的詩，但我們現在所能看見的，只有三十首。「石達開全集」比『太平天國詩文鈔』多『致湘鄕石龍幹先生』四首。</p>
<p>石達開日記裏的感　雨首，各書均著錄。此外題到寫詩的還有不少，惜十元未將原詩附入。如有云：</p>
<p>『四月初一日，予又作詩數首，意以北韋專這，勢若冰山。匝月之間，自相喋血。天道好還，人亦何苦而爲惡哉！』</p>
<p>『四月二十四日，夜觀月寫松　，吟詩數首，四姑娘和焉。』（時在荆州）</p>
<p>『五月初一日。予女四姑　與馬書記德良成婚，予作小詩紀之，有『自是有情成眷屬，敢云彩鳳去隨鴉』之句，蓋紀實也。』</p>
<p>『五月二十八日。予根　舊愁，不勝感　，乃成　首，　　手攙去，四姑　爲予存之　中，不知他日何人取以覆瓿耳。」大約『亂　復亂　』和『我朝傷內禍』都是此時所作的。</p>
<p>『九月十五日。抵延平，過鄭成功故宅，題詩于壁而出。』</p>
<p>『四月初六日，游桃源，傍晚聽囘，陰詩數首，』</p>
<p>『五月初五日，四姑娘產女，予今乃得一孫女矣，作詩一首示馬生。』</p>
<p>倘若日記不是揑造的話，那末，如上所錄。至少有十幾首詩是已經遺失了</p>
<p>可是，就連現存的卅首詩，也有些是靠不住的，據柳亞子所說，一部份遺是他的亡友髙天　所偽造，藉以鼓吹革命的。</p>
<p>現存詩中，無論內容或是形式上，近曹植者頗多，石達開也是爲洪秀全所疏遠，爲拿昌輝所忌，纔逃出來的啊，如云，『靜思三太息，衫袖涕縱橫。』『我朝傷內禍，嗟哉心內悲……已矣復何言，去去將安　。』『　分忽不逝，白日中原暮，血肉何狼藉，白骨披道路。』『大江　舟楫，臨流曷能渡，惜哉無舟楫，浮雲西北顧。』『相處日旣久，分　別贛長：……志氣復千里，威聲撼八方，』凡上所舉，都是酷肖　思王的，亂　時代，自身遭過，無一不像，無怪乎連詩也像了。</p>
<p>須然明知石達開的詩，有一部分是假的，他的日記中所謂做詩，尤不可靠，但總是　心妄想，希望全都是眞的。也許我太喜愛石　開了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c69">關於文藝工作者 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 周學銘</p>
<p>『八一三』這民族革命的的暴風用，衝擊震盪着中國一切的一切，舊的被揚棄了，新的正在血中成長。作爲時代精神的反映的文藝，必然的，也有若它特殊進展。</p>
<p>首先應指出的，是由於空前的民族危機的襲來，促使了作家們的團結，這是有其歷史根源的。中國新文藝是一向和民族解放運動不可分離的，尤其在現階段裏，為了完成文學上的抗戰利民主的任務，不論其色彩派別如何（漢奸托匪當然例外），自應走上非常坦白而且誠懇的互相尊重探討的合作的正路！</p>
<p>其次，由於抗戰形勢的發展，便作家們底生活形態起着極大的變化，他們大都紛紛上前綫，或者到游擊區中盡着任務，從戰　生活中找到眞理，他們底生活的圈子是更廣大了。</p>
<p>這偉大的抗戰是大衆的事業，一切必　以他們爲主力，這樣，文藝就得負起動員他們的使命。於是利用舊形式，來建立大衆的文藝就成爲作家們最迫切的事情。</p>
<p>爲了過應客觀的需要，小型作品如速寫，通訊，報吿之類，已代替了累贅的長篇的作品。這新的作用就在把握住劇變的現實底斷片，而加以有力的表現。像最近展開着的文藝通訊運動是更強調着這個特點。</p>
<p>這些事實，都證明了抗戰以來的文藝界進步的地方，然而，由於部分的作家們主要力量的不足，暴露出來的弱點正也不少。</p>
<p>最應値得提出的，該是部份的作家們對舊形式的利用問題。由於對它太遷就與濫用的結果，還不曾完全獲得它底醒豁明快適合大衆的表現手段，在舊形式與新內容之間却發生了極不調和的現象，甚且封建迷信的語彙和表現手法，也依舊的被採用着。</p>
<p>至於題材的片面化，更使抗戰文藝陷入公式的路上去，大多數的文章，只寫了前綫將士的英勇，而忽略了後方各階層的人物。隨着抗戰變化着的思想和生活方法或其他形態，那是都可以作爲描寫的題材的。　還有，一部分的作家，在他的作品人物的表現中，往往會有着自我化身的毛病。例如目不識丁的羣衆口中，竟能說出許多不切口吻的術語。大衆對於這些目然是隔膜丁的。其結果，紙成爲非　非馬的所謂「驢子文學」！</p>
<p>在抗戰發展到第二階段的現在，我們底文藝工作者更應充份發揮目己底能力，檢討着過去，配合了客觀的形勢，盡其筆桿的責任。這寫，我們所要注意的：</p>
<p>（一）愼重由形式的利用，尤其對於採用富於地方性的民謠，要灌輸新的內容。</p>
<p>（二）題村應深入與擴大到各階層，避免『公式』化。</p>
<p>（三）充分運用大衆語　，來克服與大衆隔陰的缺憾。</p>
<p>（四）藝術的眞實性要與內容的大衆化統一起來。</p>
<p>抗戰文藝是跟着時代而進展的，有其新啟蒙　義存在着。我們快把握着這個　。</p>

<p>消失於烟霧中，火光內，絕望的呻吟，痛楚的涕泣，歡笑變成眼淚，鬧市變成荒墟，熟　的容說，變成囘憶的姓名，團聚的家人，變爲新鬼。</p>

<p>挿上一根根荆榛，刺破了你衣裳的夢。過往的成熟的美好，不是幻想興狂妄，夢，一枚枚，圖而飽滿的果實，剔破了，跌落下地，枯萎，毀滅，埋藏土中。</p>
<p>不能忍耐心刺，亦不甘于毀滅，果實埋葬了，因緣着雨水，陽光和泥土，它終又萌茅，吐蕾，開花，結實。</p>
<p>——毀滅了，它將再生。</p>
<p>只須存留着一息的須臾，生命的潛力，不國默默，不甘滅亡，一切均可再生。芽萎了，可重萌；奮敗了，可重吐；花落了，可重開；實破了，可重結。毀滅的剌，刺破了衣裳，但祗有加增你心的憤怒。憤　像煤油，潑上人生的火，人乃愈有生機。擠近了些，你更可推遠：壓迫了些，你更可反抗；激怒了些，你更可勇敢；毀滅了些了你更可再生。</p>
<p>該謝謝那心刺，毀滅你的所有，使你愛惜，悲憫，忿恨，咒詛。沒有這些，你不會復仇。沒有憤怒的推　，你也不會如此有力。沒有强迫的破壞，也不會自行拆除。</p>
<p>給你毀滅了，給你推盪了，也給你刺痛了。愛惜舊物者，你須創造新物；悲憫已滅者，你須給他們安慰；忿恨作俑者，你須給他們報復；咒詛邪惡者，你須給他們膺　。</p>
<p>不必遞弔於荒墟，從瓦　中尋覓舊日之繁華，抹上頽垣的斜陽，而你看了便頽然無語。你不妨慷慨，漢然，在霍　磨刃時，對仇人一笑。該謝謝毀滅，毀滅了一枚果　，可產生兩校三枚，甚至拾百枚。將來你可於焦土上，覩輪奐的巍峨，代謝的新生，將比他們的祖宗更健全而有力。腐敗毀滅了，可產生健全；古老毀滅了，可產生淸新；沈澱毀滅了，可可產生純粹。</p>
<p>毀滅使我們憤怒，但更使我們有力，我不怕毀滅，只怕沒有再生。</p>

<p>在她臨去的時候，他突然爆發了一種惜別的情緒，他難捨她從目己的身邊離去——去後，見時涉茫。短的相識，離知相會何時？雖然他相信她可以成爲一　同志；但是　能担保，想像可以成生事實了在這奇異的遭遇中，他一且和她分手；此後，如果在人生的路上，相背而行，郵麽，他以往難忘的記憶，將怎樣打動着他的心思？於是，他要他的同志先走了，遷移了：他送她囘家去。他願在這最後的一次送行中，以慰現在和將來所有對她由懷念而起的不安的心。</p>
<p>她被沉默地陪着走着來時的屋門，房門，走着來時的院路。她從身邊不住地外望，去是已非來時一樣：來時，是兩天前的夜深，曾感對憎惡，去時，是這早晨以後不久，覺着一切都値得留戀。但來時又和去時一樣，來去全非自願。彷彿是一個夢，他在夢中勾留了幾乎三天，這三天，彷彿是像度過了一年，又彷彿快　像是一霎間。</p>
<p>他們兩人併肩行走，巳是一對好友，他們在別離中，是短的；送別的話，長得無限。送行者和被送者同是不肯現開長步，同是怕路縮短，同是希望延長片刻的時間，使雙方多有一句兩句的贈嘗。他們兩人便是這樣；這去時，和她來時相似，和他的來時却完全相反。</p>
<p>突然，在路上，她站下了；但這不是來時的停留。　想了想，而得說：</p>

<h3 id="e1">Two Wartime Dispatches from the Rear <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Rear - Shanghai - Fresh Blood Dyes the Glorious National Flag Red</p>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Shanghai, an isolated island. Regarding the issue of the national flag, from last year until now, there have been many tragic and moving events.</p>
<p>Heroic Past Deeds</p>
<p>Last year, to commemorate the anniversary of August 13th, at the intersection of the concession and the Chinese area, for hanging flags, the Japanese army even opened fire on the Blue Sky White Sun flags hanging in the residences of the concession, so until now, it is not easy to see the Blue Sky White Sun flag in those places during anniversaries.</p>
<p>Also last year, around the time of Double Tenth Festival, a rice shop on Route Paul Henry de Segonzac, a road built beyond the boundary of the Shanghai Western District, was discovered by a Japanese military officer for hanging the Blue Sky White Sun flag. He attempted to snatch it away and even wanted to commit violence. Fortunately, American soldiers intervened and nothing happened. However, since then, it has been rare to see the Blue Sky White Sun flag hanging in the areas of roads built beyond the boundary.</p>
<p>The fact that the Lone Army of the Four Banks was beaten and injured by White Russian soldiers for hanging the national flag is well known to readers; however, since that dispute, the flagpole for raising the flag has not been as high as before.</p>
<p>This spring, a brave man went to the Dongchang Road area in Pudong to hang the national flag, but was unfortunately arrested and beheaded by the Japanese. Before being beheaded, the Japanese soldiers pierced the Blue Sky White Sun flag onto a bamboo pole, sharpened the other end of the bamboo pole, and stabbed it into his back, and escorted him to parade in Dongchang Road and other places; all Chinese people who saw it could not help but shed tears. No wonder when the puppet police forced the people living in those areas to hang the puppet flags, they either did not hang them, or hung them upside down, or lowered the national flag.</p>
<p>The Tragedy Begins</p>
<p>Since the French Concession authorities twice interfered with the hanging of the national flag on March 12th and March 29th, the Chinese living in the French Concession have taken the matter of hanging the national flag very seriously. Therefore, on April 19th, the day of the General Mobilization of Spiritual Strength for Industry and Commerce Propaganda, residents and shops in the French Concession unanimously competed to hang the flag. Who knew that this would lead to disputes and tragedies, resulting in a major strike.</p>
<p>Around 9 o'clock in the morning, a large number of Russian police and Annamese police came to interfere with the shops and residents hanging the flag, asking them to take it down. Some refused, while others complied. Usually, for not complying with the removal of the flag, at most there would be a fine, so many shops and residents would rather be fined than take it down. Those who took it down would soon hang it up again. Unexpectedly, the Russian and Annamese police beat and arrested people, and confiscated the flag. Moreover, some Annamese and Russian police used bayonets to tear the national flag that had already been taken down in compliance into strips, or threw it on the ground, causing multiple damages to the national flag. "It's fine not to let us hang the flag, but we shouldn't insult the national flag representing China in this way!" As a result, all the shops voluntarily closed their doors and suspended business to express their protest.</p>
<p>After 4 o'clock, more shops voluntarily suspended business to express their protest. After 7 o'clock, Avenue Edward VII, which was usually very lively and brightly lit, completely turned into a ghost town, shrouded in a dim and miserable atmosphere. People were indignant and silent. Although armored vehicles occasionally passed by, no one paid attention to them. Although the Russian and Annamese police were very proud holding wooden sticks, they gradually felt bored and the number of people gradually decreased.</p>
<p>Recognizing the Japanese</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th, the French Concession had fallen into a complete general strike. After 10 o'clock, there were even more strikes. The Chamber of Commerce's勸吿(勸吿) to resume business was also ineffective. Finally, the Chinese Taxpayers Association issued a notice stating that in order to maintain the long-standing friendly relations between China and France, this incident was entirely due to the improper actions of the Annamese and Russian police, and that they would proceed cautiously to negotiate based on reason. However, to prevent奸人(奸人) from creating trouble, they hoped that everyone would temporarily endure the pain and resume business first. At the same time, a prominent Shanghai merchant residing in Hong Kong also telegraphed various important public organizations, asking them to recognize the enemy and handle the matter properly. Therefore, after 4 o'clock, all the merchants listened to the勸吿(勸吿) and resumed business first.</p>
<p>After so many struggles and sacrifices by the sons and daughters of China in Shanghai, one day, in a day of universal jubilation, the national flag will surely be raised together with our Blue Sky White Sun flag by all friendly countries, except for the invaders.</p>
<p>Our Rear - Guilin - Early Summer Joint Friendship Meeting - Friendship 送鹿亘 (Guilin Correspondence) Since withdrawing from Wuhan, Mr. Luge Diheng has moved to Guilin, and it has been exactly five and a half months. During this period, in addition to completing a book of more than 100,000 words, "Record of the Peace Village," he has further studied the Japanese situation and has also lectured at a Japanese training class. After returning, he also served as a full-time lecturer in the Japanese language training class, explaining the recent situation of the Japanese and the key points of propaganda work against Japan. Although he did not stay in the Japanese language training class for a long time, he gave intensive lectures every week and helped students solve many problems, which greatly benefited the students. Therefore, when he had to temporarily say goodbye to Guilin due to official business, the students held a special farewell party, partly to express their farewell to him, and at the same time, everyone had a good time and strengthened their future learning spirit to show that they would not disappoint the expectations of their teachers.</p>
<p>The time was at 6 pm on the 7th, on that vast green lawn. The evening wind gently kissed the neat grass-green military uniforms. More than 200 male and female students sat in a circle listening to Mr. Luge Dijian's farewell message. Today, Luge Diheng was particularly excited, waving his fists, and his rhythmic tone showed his love for these more than 200 young people. Although it was a temporary farewell, everyone's hearts were filled with a common emotion, and the determination to fight violence to the end, and especially慎重(慎重)ly put forward the key points that political workers should always grasp in the future: "...War is a clash of swords, and political work is an invisible fight. If we have some negligence, the Japanese will give us a fatal blow. Therefore, political workers should be particularly careful and work hard everywhere. Everything must be understood from the root and a comprehensive understanding must be obtained. For example, the Japanese recently want to exploit five million tons of iron in the occupied areas and are currently planning it. If we want to find a way to break this plan, we must ask for an understanding of the whole problem, and we must find a way to know how much capital the Japanese need to exploit five million tons of iron and to what extent the plan has been carried out. With a concrete knowledge base, we can obtain clues, and then use these clues to break the Japanese conspiracy. At the same time, we must always be vigilant and not relax for a minute in observing and identifying things. This is to overcome with the strength of the general mobilization of spirit. So if every citizen has a unique observation of any fact, then the general mobilization of spirit can be said to have achieved success..." Finally, Luge Diheng repeated, "We will continue to struggle hard together, and our blood vessels will always be injected with the same blood..."</p>
<p>After Luge Diheng's speech ended in a burst of enthusiastic applause, Feng Naichao's concise and powerful speech rang in everyone's ears. He explained that language is a weapon. Today, the Japanese we learn can be used as dynamite and thrown into the Japanese camp, giving the Japanese a great threat. And when the Japanese warlords and we finish fighting for a while, we will use this weapon to eliminate the mutual隔閔(隔閔) and hatred between the people and establish permanent human peace. So what everyone learns in this shortest time is not a waste, but bears a particularly great mission.</p>
<p>Team leader Wang, accompanied by Luge Diheng and Feng Naichao, had dinner on the土墩(土墩) they had filled in themselves. In the evening breeze, they watched the students enthusiastically rejoice, perform, and sing until about 9 o'clock, when they bid farewell to this atmosphere full of vitality and returned.</p>
<p>Wartime Capital - Chongqing - Japanese Planes Set Great Fire - Mountain City's Righteous Indignation is High</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) The sun was already shining obliquely on the mountain city, and it was almost dusk. People were preparing to participate in the May Fourth Commemoration Meeting. A long air raid siren sounded. Due to the enemy's疯狂(疯狂) bombing of Chongqing on "May 3rd," people had already hidden in air raid shelters before the emergency air raid siren. Following the emergency air raid siren, Japanese planes invaded the skies of Chongqing. The well-ordered formation of the Japanese planes had already been dispersed by our high-altitude artillery. The Japanese planes frantically dropped incendiary bombs in the skies of the historic and civilized mountain city. The incendiary bombs ignited in the air. Hundreds of red fireballs fell from the sky to the center of Chongqing. The Japanese,慌惶(慌惶)亂(亂)ly threw bombs and then hurriedly fled for their lives under the pursuit of our planes.</p>
<p>Fireballs fell into the center of Chongqing. Flames rose one after another, and the sky was full of black smoke. The red fire illuminated Chongqing. Houses collapsed in a row. People were shouting. The fire burned with the wind. The sky was full of flying wood chips, even more than the sparks of fireworks. Street after street was burning with fire. The red light illuminating Chongqing was brighter than daylight. The most prosperous commercial streets: Douyu Street, Chaijia Lane, Cangping Street, Xinfeng Street, Qixinggang, all became fire dragons. The red fire became a river of fire. The whole of Chongqing became a sea of fire.</p>
<p>People were rescuing merchandise, luggage, suitcases, and goods. Stretcher teams and temporary ambulance teams organized by various agencies and groups were rescuing the wounded compatriots, women, and children. Corpses that had been charred in the sea of fire were carried out one by one.</p>
<p>Streets that had not been affected were full of luggage, suitcases, merchandise, old women, and women sitting on some of the scattered belongings they had rescued, watching the fire set by the Japanese turn happy families into ashes. No one was crying, and not even the women and children were shedding tears. The flames of people's anger were higher than the flames of the Japanese. Everyone was gritting their teeth, vowing to avenge this blood fire in the fire-lit night.</p>
<p>The Chongqing branch of the Commercial Press was completely burned down. Ta Kung Pao and Xinhua Daily were burned. The Sichuan Provincial Bank Office, the China National Goods Company, the Cathay Hotel, the Post Office, and countless shops and countless happy families were all burned to ashes. The German Consulate was also burned down by the Japanese fascist **. Coincidentally, only a white curtain was left fluttering in the wind. The French and British Consulates were also on fire. This is what the Japanese broadcast that night: "We are carrying out a large-scale bombing with the Military Affairs Committee's headquarters as the target, completely crushing all military agencies and achieving results beyond expectations."</p>
<p>After setting the great fire, the Japanese fascist ** laughed wildly, wanting to celebrate this act of destroying humanity. The fire burned from May 4th to May 5th, and was still burning late into the night of May 6th. The wounded were crowded in hospitals. Charred corpses were carried out from the fire one by one. Corpses piled up on the streets, men, women, old, young, adults, and children together, piled up as high as mountains, big and small. Can this blood feud and fire debt not be avenged? The Chinese people must never watch this暴×(暴×) rampant in the world again.</p>
<p>The people of the city were rationally evacuating. Disaster victims began to register. Bread and steamed buns were distributed in the disaster area. Chairman Chiang personally issued an edict that all private and public cars in the city should be concentrated and used exclusively for evacuating citizens. Citizens who went outside the city from inside the city were transported by the concentrated cars to nearby villages they wanted to go to without compensation. From late at night to dawn, people were constantly evacuating.</p>
<p>The fire field was constantly being dug up, and corpses were being unearthed. There were dead bodies everywhere in the city. People were busy rescuing and rescuing. Ten newspapers in Chongqing were mostly burned down. Temporarily, the Central Daily News, Ta Kung Pao, Shih Shih Hsin Pao, Sao Tang Pao, Hsin Shu Pao, Hsin Min Pao, Southwest Daily, Commercial Daily, and National Gazette published a joint edition. Xinhua Daily published a half-page newspaper in a difficult struggle. The city's activities were completely moved outside the city.</p>
<p>The fire in Chongqing gradually extinguished after burning for more than fifty hours. However, the flames of hatred in the hearts of the Chinese people against the Japanese fascist ** will never be extinguished. May 7th morning</p>
<p>All Guilin Journalists Take Blood Oath - Telegraph Condolences to Chongqing Colleagues - Raise Donations to Aid Disaster-Stricken Compatriots</p>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) At a lecture meeting of "General Mobilization of National Spirit" convened by the Guilin branch of the Youth Journalist Association on the 29th of last month, it was decided to implement the General Mobilization of National Spirit and hold a national anti-Japanese 公約(公約) oath for all Guilin journalists on May 9th, to commemorate May 9th.</p>
<p>Therefore, yesterday afternoon from 3 pm to 5 pm, the Guilin branch of the Youth Journalist Association hosted a national anti-Japanese 公約(公約) oath for all Guilin journalists, divided into two sessions, at the Provincial Party Headquarters Auditorium.</p>
<p>Before 3 o'clock, more than 20 members of this newspaper, including workers and printing workers, arrived at the oath location first. Then, the uniformly dressed male and female comrades of the Guangxi Daily arrived in a majestic double line. Then came the mixed-color summer clothing of the International Brigade (International News Agency) in a double line. Then the comrades of Ta Kung Pao, Xinhua Daily, Sao Tang Pao, Central News Agency, the Southern Office of the Journalist Association, and the Overseas Chinese Journalists Corps arrived one after another. There were mainly members here, but there were also non-members and printing workers and workers.</p>

<p>To the Chongqing Municipal Government, please forward to all compatriots in the city: Japanese crazy bombing of Chongqing. Compatriots innocently suffered. The blood feud and injustice, how can we not avenge it? We hope that you will listen to the government's leadership, actively participate in the War of Resistance, wipe out the Japanese **, and share peace and prosperity. In addition to jointly raising donations with the Guilin and Los Angeles communities for relief, we send a special telegram of condolence. (Same signatories as above) The Guilin branch of the Qingji Association telegraphed the Ministry of Propaganda of the Central Committee yesterday, requesting severe punishment of Japanese-controlled newspapers and publications such as Nanhua Daily, Tian Daily, International Weekly, Freedom Review, and Times Selections, in order to eliminate the roots of chaos. The original text is recorded as follows: To Minister Ye Jun of the Central Propaganda Department. Wang Jingwei **...** Recently, they have intensified their efforts to wantonly slander the Central Government, often spreading rumors in their self-run Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, and buying **Daily, **Weekly, **Review, **Selections and other newspapers and publications in the area to spread their rumors... This is the most extreme case. Therefore, we telegraphed your office to quickly order the above-mentioned newspapers and publications to be effectively dealt with in order to correct international views and prevent汉奸(汉奸) from causing chaos. This is our sincere prayer. Also, we telegraphed the headquarters of the Central News Agency to forward to its Hong Kong branch to stop supplying all telegraphic news and materials to the above-mentioned **newspapers. The original telegram is omitted. Also, the "Life Daily" published by ** and the "Oriental Daily" published in Shanghai have recently appeared in the city. The content is to spread the atmosphere of peace and all kinds of absurd remarks. The provincial government has strictly ordered it to be investigated and banned, and strictly prohibited its entry at the entrance.</p>
<p>General Li Zongren's Roar - We Must Respond to Japanese Aggression with Action</p>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) When the morning mist shrouding the mountain city had not yet dissipated at 7 am, large slogans written in large white characters on large blue cloths were hung at the intersections of the streets,醒目(醒目)ly writing "Commemorate the National Humiliation of May 9th, Implement General Mobilization of National Spirit." Several agencies and shops that had opened their doors hung half-mast national flags. Thousands of armed comrades, public officials, students... lined up to go to the Public Stadium.</p>
<p>At the front of the stage in the stadium, a banner was horizontally hung, reading: "Guangxi All Circles May 9th National Humiliation Commemoration Conference." Then, the broadcast opened and broadcasted loud and clear salvation songs. The ranks of gray armed forces and gray-blue uniforms gradually filled the gaps in the middle of the square. On the stage, Chairman Li, Madam Li, and representatives from all circles arrived. Then, Chairman Bai of the conference walked onto the stage amidst the敬禮(敬禮) of the entire venue. More than a month of奔波(奔波) on various battlefields had indeed made him thinner, but it did not reduce his upright spirit and solemn威(威) appearance. The conference began amidst the sound of music.</p>
<p>Chairman Bai delivered the opening remarks, first briefly explaining the history of May 9th. Then he talked about the significance of commemorating "May 9th" this year: "Since the signing of the Twenty-One Demands until now, every aggression of the enemy against us has been based on the main points of that苛(苛)条约(条约). The outbreak of the War of Resistance gave the Japanese a fierce blow. Now that the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, we are getting closer to紛碎(紛碎) this kind of restraint. Today, commemorating May 9th must be commemorated by intensifying the法(法) war. First, we must adhere to a protracted war and launch a full-scale war. The victory of the War of Resistance does not only depend on the implementation of general mobilization of spirit, and the implementation of economic opposition to lock. According to my recent inspections of various battlefields, the Japanese are clearly getting weaker and weaker. Also, according to people who recently returned from Japan, the war in the past 22 months has been a profound pain in the lives of the Japanese people. The war has taken away their leather shoes, ties, and women's 　(　)children, and if they continue to fight, their lives will also be消滅(消滅)ed. The final victory is not far away - secondly, we must intensify the好(好) work. Third, the international peace forces are growing stronger day by day, and we must strive for international justice as an aid to our country's victory in the War of Resistance..." Finally, he said very沉重(沉重)ly: "Snow Shame - Snow Shame - cannot be accomplished by formal commemorative meetings and lip service. It must be expressed with action." Then everyone shouted slogans enthusiastically, expressing their determination.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan's Recent Adventures <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The untamed Japanese aggressors now seem to have reached the end of their hesitation and entered the first step of starting　(　)　　　.</p>
<p>In this period, the aggressor's struggle will inevitably take on a special posture. We can see this in the aggressor's political and strategic policies towards China, and its foreign policy towards third countries. Japan's operations against China have resulted in many deaths and injuries. According to confirmed information, the number of casualties is close to more than 900,000, and the number of troops膠着(膠着) on various battlefields is also more than one million. With the expansion of the battlefield, the aggressor's army allocation has felt very difficult. But since the aggressor has no way to收拾(收拾) this war situation, they naturally plan to come back to迴光(迴光)返照(返照) a few times. As a result, the inhumane bombing of major cities began. Cities following Chongqing have suffered destruction. They launched shameless汉奸(汉奸) to carry out activities everywhere, also for the sake of responding to this massacre.</p>
<p>The aggressor's diplomacy towards third countries has also felt束手無策(束手無策). The "friendly diplomacy" announced by the Hiranuma Cabinet has completely碰(碰)了壁(了壁). Although Shigemitsu Aoi is still exploring Britain's attitude in London, thinking of it as the basis for adjusting British-Japanese relations, but from the general trend, the Japanese warlords have become焦灼(焦灼). The outwardly fierce but inwardly timid Japanese diplomatic posture has continued in Tianjin Concession and Shanghai Concession　(　)　　　　　　, and they have blatantly landed on Gulangyu, attempting to occupy this public concession of various countries. This is still a kind of intimidation and exploration, but the aggressor's ambition has been quite revealed.</p>
<p>Recent Japanese輿論(輿論), especially several newspapers representing the consciousness of the military, such as "Kokumin Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun," have made an objective analysis of the new situation in the Sino-Japanese War and put forward specific proposals. They believe that the new stage of dealing with the Sino-Japanese War requires new methods. They believe that there are two aspects to the strength that supports China's strong resistance: one is the active assistance of third countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union; the other is the strong Chinese national spirit based on the Three Principles of the People. There are two strategies for dealing with third countries: coordination and recklessness. They argue that the prospects for coordination are very few and hope is little, so they can only adopt reckless methods. This occupation of Gulangyu is an even higher level of recklessness towards third countries. If the experiment of Gulangyu is successful, then not to mention the concessions of third countries, even their rights and interests in China will be completely swept away by the aggressor. Secondly, the aggressor launched soulless汉奸(汉奸) to shake our country's spirit of resistance, and intensified their political and cultural activities.　　　 They have indeed arrived in Shanghai, and fish soldiers and shrimp generals are already in　(　)　　　　　布(布)置ing their迷魂(迷魂)阵(阵).</p>
<p>Our government and people have their own methods to eliminate traitors for the activities of the汉奸(汉奸), and their煽惑(煽惑) will not be effective on the nationals who have been磨练(磨练) for 22 months. Only recklessness towards third countries requires appropriate and effective measures from third countries. Recently, the Yomiuri Shimbun of Japan commented that the Japanese government has reached a certain conclusion on its policy towards third countries, that is, moderate means are not enough to solve the problem of public concessions, and the government feels the need to perform surgical operations on public concessions. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita further stated that because "the attitude of Britain and the United States is stubborn," a strong step has been decided to solve the problem of the Shanghai Public Concession. This further proves that our speculation is not without basis. In this regard, third countries need more active and effective measures. Regarding the attitude of the Gulangyu issue, the United Kingdom and the United States have paid considerable attention, but except for the United States being more active, there has been no further indication as of now. Thousands upon thousands of Chinese compatriots are already in an environment of隨便(隨便) 残(残)杀(杀) and detention, but this is not just a Chinese disaster!</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Borderlands in the Rear of the War and International Thoroughfares: The Life of the Yi People in Western Yunnan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Min Lian (sent from Mangshi)</p>
<p>"The flowers on this mountain are so beautiful,</p>
<p>I wish I could find someone as lovely as a flower,</p>
<p>But alas,</p>
<p>I can never seem to find such a one." The woman sings in response.</p>
<p>"The flowers on this mountain are truly beautiful,</p>
<p>It's a pity I am not someone as lovely as a flower;</p>
<p>But alas,</p>
<p>I hope someone will come and talk to me." The man sings again:</p>
<p>"You are indeed as beautiful as these flowers,</p>
<p>Truly,</p>
<p>If you do not refuse my words,</p>
<p>I would like to come and talk with you." There's more after that, but I don't remember it clearly, but singing to this point generally means a decision has been made. There are also some mountain songs. Using the moon as a metaphor, depicting one's own loneliness, these are also sung a lot. However, the claim of promiscuity among the Yi people, according to those who have lived there for a long time, is not the case. The so-called promiscuous group are not women from ordinary families, but rather maids in the Tusi (chieftain) yamen (office). Because each Tusi yamen always buys anywhere from thirty to forty or even fifty or sixty maids to serve, their treatment is very harsh. When the autumn harvest comes, young men carry several rupees in their large bags. At this time, they go up the mountain, partly to earn a little money for themselves and partly to alleviate their sexual frustration. Only they are relatively easy to agree with after a few songs. Widows also engage in this behavior; but in general, young men and women, although they openly seek love, the consideration period is very long. In particular, the Yi people value oaths and definitely do not engage in casual relationships.</p>
<p>Public Works</p>
<p>In the border areas, public works are virtually non-existent. If one were to insist, there are only some temples, a few public graveyards, and a few incomplete schools. There are no public health facilities. Pigs and dogs run wild along the roads, and cattle and horses are in disarray. There are no hospitals or medicine. When Yi people get sick, they simply worship gods and offer sacrifices to ghosts, and use some unreliable folk remedies. They don't necessarily have to die,</p>
<p>but instead, they slowly watch them die. In each Tusi family, there are two trainees from a certain medical school in Burma working as doctors. They can also give vaccinations, but they charge exorbitant prices, which ordinary Yi people do not inquire about. Aside from a few incomplete small schools, the Yi people have no opportunity to enjoy cultural education. The last time people from the interior went to show some science films, the Yi people watched, filling the streets and lanes, showing how eager the Yi people are to learn. There are no public buildings that benefit the public. Besides seeing dirty streets and earthen walls covered with cow dung cakes (used as firewood), there is nothing to admire.</p>
<p>National Consciousness</p>
<p>Although the national consciousness of the Yi people has been neglected for hundreds of years, they are still very enthusiastic about the Han people and about China. In the past, they only knew about the Tusi, but today, they already know that above the Tusi, there is also the provincial government of Yunnan, there is also Chairman Chiang, and there is the entire Republic of China. Especially recently, our transportation on the border has been busy, which easily excites them. Many Yi people already know that our China and Japanese imperialism are fighting desperately. They are very faithfully helping to build roads and very excitedly helping to transport goods. Yi soldiers are also as loyal and brave as Chinese soldiers, raising their guns, day and night, and defending our wartime wealth without slackening. Even the Tusi, in the past, due to the enticement of foreigners, became indifferent to China, but since the War of Resistance, their perception has changed. I think this is the best time for us to win them over to the inner front and work together for the liberation of the great Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In the rear of the War of Resistance, on the national defense border line, stand these thousands and tens of thousands of Yi compatriots. Their every move, their food and clothing, should attract our attention: How to understand their complex national character; how to use their instinctive sturdiness to organize a force for the War of Resistance; how to appropriately, but bravely and decisively, reform their existing unsound social system and administrative structure; how to systematically organize and train their original armed forces to develop into a huge national defense force on the border; how to proactively and decisively resolve many diplomatic disputes; how to help them develop their economy to improve their daily lives; how to help them develop public works to improve their existing harsh living environment; how to make use of their original good customs, habits, and the foundation of language, writing, and education to raise their cultural level, and thereby strengthen their solidarity as a great Chinese nation, united in resisting the consciousness of aggression. These issues, today's wise War of Resistance government, wise experts and scholars, loyal War of Resistance and national salvation groups and organizations, and the patriotic compatriots of the whole country, should put them on the agenda and give them prompt discussion and implementation. The Chinese nation is a whole. Today, our people only have one goal: to defeat Japanese [text obscured]!</p>

<h3 id="e4">Crushing the [Enemy] Warlord's Air Raid Plan: Chairman Chiang's Proclamation to the Whole Nation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Chairman Chiang, in order to prevent [enemy] planes from bombing, has recently issued a letter to the provincial and municipal governments and compatriots across the country. The full text is as follows: Since the beginning of this month, [enemy] planes have bombed civilian residential areas in various parts of our country more than fifty times. In Chongqing alone, the total number of compatriots killed and injured has reached thousands. In addition to Fuzhou, Xi'an, Luoyang, Xiangfan, and various places in the front lines of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, which have suffered countless bombings, other cities without military facilities or areas where military agencies are not located, such as Quanzhou, Changting, Qiongzhou, Shaoguan, Longxi, Tong'an, Shantou, Ningbo, Jinhua, Hengyang, Zhijiang, Yuanling, and Hanzhong, have also been subjected to indiscriminate bombings, suffering injuries and slaughter. Blood has flowed across the land, and flames have filled the sky. The cruelty is beyond description. The [enemy] bandits often claim that they only bomb areas with military facilities; this kind of despicable statement, a base and habitual trick, is already well-known to both Chinese and foreigners. How can they conceal their barbaric and violent crimes?</p>
<p>Three Purposes of [Enemy] Air Raids</p>
<p>There are only three purposes for [enemy] planes to bomb our civilians so fiercely: First, to use continuous bombing to threaten the spirit of resistance of our people across the country, hoping that our compatriots will kneel and surrender; second, to use fierce bombing to cut off the lives of our compatriots, attempting to reduce production among our compatriots in displacement, affecting the future of our War of Resistance; third, to use concentrated bombing to harm the tranquility of our society,妄 想 to disrupt the order of our rear. - The [enemy] has these three purposes, and they also know that the foundation of our national salvation lies entirely in the people, so they want to destroy our nation. They must first cut off the lives of our people. This is why their bombing, burning, and killing must choose areas where our civilians are densely populated. Not only is this the case in Chongqing, but also in other places. Moreover, their future cruel and bestial acts will be even worse than today.</p>
<p>Suffering Brutality: How to Retaliate?</p>
<p>Our compatriots across the country, suffering brutality, clearly understand their poisonous plot, and should do everything possible to prevent and retaliate against it. Here, I present three things to tell our compatriots: (1) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it has been almost two years. The morale and unity of our people have surpassed those of ancient times, astonishing the world. The [enemy] has seen this and believes that if they do not indulge their [bestial] nature and display their ferocity and cruelty, then their plan of aggression has reached its end, and the trend of collapse will be immediate. Therefore, within half a month, they have engaged in blind and frenzied bombing, inhumane and unprecedented catastrophe. Our compatriots have been subjected to their poison for two years and are no longer surprised by it. However, having recently suffered such frenzied bombing, they are still able to remain calm and act as usual. This kind of spirit is enough to strip the [enemy's] soul and制毒計毒計 prevent their poisonous plan. Moreover, governments at all levels are working diligently and vigilantly, and doing their best to protect the people. All measures, both passive and active, are now becoming more and more complete. In the future, we will not only not worry about their continuous bombing, but we will also make them waste their efforts and exhaust themselves, so as to crush their primary goal.</p>
<p>Resisting to the End: Seeking Survival in Death</p>
<p>However, our compatriots should know that what the [enemy] will bomb in the future is definitely not limited to one city or one town, but their goal is all the cities in our country and the entire nation. As for the government and military facilities, although they have been bombed many times, the losses are minimal because they are somewhat afraid. This can be proved by the fact that they did not dare to carry out low-altitude bombing in our military equipment areas in the past. On the contrary, all places without military equipment are subjected to indiscriminate and frenzied bombing at any time and any place, without any consideration. From this, we know that if our country cannot actively strengthen its military force and resist to the end, then the whole country will surrender its arms and be slaughtered, waiting for death. If this is the case, the [enemy's] flame will be even more fierce, and the danger of destruction will be immediate. Not only will our modern compatriots be slaughtered, but also our nation will never recover for generations to come. Therefore, our compatriots across the country should be even more determined to resist to the end in order to achieve the goal of seeking survival in death. I deeply believe that my people will be able to learn a profound lesson from this tragic bombing, remember this deep hatred, and never forget it for the rest of their lives, passing it on to future generations until we annihilate the [enemy] and avenge our dead compatriots.</p>
<p>Going to the Countryside: Developing Rural Areas</p>
<p>(2) Before issuing the order to evacuate the citizens, the government had already started the necessary preparations. Rural areas are the source of life for our people. The fertile land can be cultivated and studied. The simple rooms can be rested and worked in. There are more than a million villages in the surrounding areas of the city. As long as each family accommodates one person, it will be more than enough to accommodate the entire city. However, our citizens who go to the countryside should strictly abide by the government's regulations and appreciate the enthusiasm of our fellow villagers for their care: those with skills should assist in the development of the countryside; those who are educated should often educate the children of farmers, helping each other and sharing joys and sorrows. In this way, not only will the citizens have a place to rest, but the countryside will also flourish. This is not only a temporary plan to avoid disaster, but also the foundation of nation-building. The key to certain victory lies entirely in the reliance on rural areas, enriching rural areas, and developing production, which is to lay the foundation of the country and enhance national strength. Now, because of the continuous atrocities of [enemy] planes, we can establish our grand plan for nation-building. The second purpose of the [enemy] will not only be crushed as a result, but our great cause of nation-building will also be realized as a result. However, what should be noted is that on the one hand, we should actively evacuate, and on the other hand, we should strengthen organization to strengthen the fortress of our spirit of resistance. In this way, even if [enemy] planes use their full strength to attack continuously, compared to the vastness of our country's land and the number of towns, it is no different from a grain of millet in a granary. Therefore, after our urban compatriots live in the countryside, the [enemy's] plan will be exhausted, and they will have no way to use their skills.</p>
<p>Protection and Cooperation</p>
<p>(3) For the residents who remain in the city, governments at all levels should do their best to protect them, such as opening fire lanes, piling sandbags, storing water, and implementing them thoroughly, to fulfill their responsibilities; all our citizens must also strictly abide by the regulations and work tirelessly. Then, even if [enemy] planes use their full strength, even if every bullet hits its target, one bullet can only destroy one empty house, and with many houses and alleys, it is easier to avoid disaster. The [enemy] will not be able to make up for their losses, and we will be free from the suffering of being affected by the disaster. Other cities should also actively implement unified control like the Chongqing urban area, with fixed trenches for avoiding bombs and fixed positions for advancing and retreating, uniformly and neatly arranged, and well-prepared. Those who remain in the city will face less danger; those who go to the countryside will have a place to live and be at peace. They will work together, each in their own position, with no one outside the regulations and no one without a place to work. In the future, [enemy] planes will continue to attack and will concentrate their bombing. If our compatriots can advance and retreat according to all regulations, they will be able to deal with changes as usual and will not suffer unnecessary losses. Governments at all levels must urge the police, officers, soldiers, and all public officials and local 保甲 (bao jia) heads to fully mobilize and perform their duties, so that the order of society will not be adversely affected in the slightest. In this way, the [enemy's] third goal will also be completely crushed by us.</p>
<p>Overall Situation: Victory is Assured</p>
<p>Now, regarding the entire course of the war, I would like to tell our compatriots. Today, the [enemy's] army is at the end of its rope, and the true nature of its desperation is further proven by the 22 months of war. Since the start of the war on July 7th, the [enemy] has used all its strength to try to dominate us, but our army has risen up to resist and has not weakened after a hundred battles. Until now, in the overall situation of the war, in the northern battlefield, our army is still in the northeastern region of Lugouqiao, Tianjin, Chahar, and Suiyuan, continuing to work hard, bravely advancing; in the eastern battlefield, our army is still in the area of Ji, Jing, Hu, and Hang, galloping and traversing, attacking and defending freely; in the southern battlefield, our army is still actively attacking on the Guangjiu and Guangsand lines, repeatedly conquering important towns. And the provincial cities of Kaifeng and Anqing, which have been occupied by the [enemy] for a year, are not only controlled by our army, but have also been captured by our army. In the future, the capture and abandonment of the major towns in the occupied areas will be determined by us. This is a miracle that has never happened in the history of national wars, whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad. Looking back at the current situation of the [enemy's] army, not only are they deeply mired in the mire and being attacked by our forces, but they are also trapped in our encirclement. The dangerous and difficult situation they are in is not known to outsiders. This is also rare in ancient and modern war history. As for our people's firm will, economic stability, and the factors that lead to victory, I will not mention them for now. Based on the war situation in the past 22 months and the comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the [enemy] and us, it is sufficient to prove that our country's final victory is assured.</p>
<p>What are [Enemy] Planes Worth?</p>
<p>The only thing that the [enemy] prides itself on in the world is its army, which has been trained for many years, but when it encounters our army's resistance, the record of its progress is only like this. Then, what is the total strength of its air force, which is only about 2,000 aircraft, worth? Therefore, the [enemy's] planes can only attack the cities in our 2,000 counties and cannot destroy the villages in our 90 million households; they can only kill and injure the lives of those who cannot avoid them in time and cannot shake the spirit of hatred of our 450 million compatriots. Since ancient times, the spirit of unyielding integrity of our nation has always been promoted by foreign invasions. History is clear and bright as the sun and stars. The reason why loyal officials and people with lofty ideals face difficulties without being careless and regard death as homecoming is that they all inherit the spirit of this national tradition. From the distant Yangzhou Massacre and the Jiading Massacre to the recent Jinan Massacre on May 3rd and the massacre in Nanjing's inner city, all are recorded in the history of our national spirit in fire and blood. As for the brutality of their air force, it cannot shake the slightest bit of our nation's spirit of resistance, and it is believed that the forging of our national character will be more refined, the unity will be increased, and the foundation of the country will be strengthened. Moreover, we know that the pain caused by the [enemy's] frenzied bombing of our country today will inevitably lead them to drink the bullet of killing themselves. Is the recent retribution not the fact that the [enemy's] military and civilians in the arms factories and chemical factories in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Fukui 千弃 and other places have been continuously and systematically bombed?</p>
<p>If There is a Human Heart, Can One Not Rise Up?</p>
<p>In summary, the [enemy's] act of frenzied bombing everywhere this time is certainly cruel and hateful, and their desperation is evident. Those of our compatriots who are hit by their bullets either have their flesh and blood torn apart, or their homes are destroyed. If there is a human heart, can one not feel compassion? Remembering also that our compatriots in the occupied areas are enslaved and bound by the [enemy] men, and the women are forced and humiliated by the [enemy] army, they rely on the faces of others, weeping in private, as if in a cage, as if in prison, unable to survive and unable to die. All the suffering is many times greater than that of our compatriots under today's air raids. What is even worse is that they force our compatriots to take their poisons and inject their poisonous needles, not only to make us kill ourselves, but also to force us to destroy our race. All the misery suffered by our compatriots is many times greater than the bombing. If we do not unite and seek revenge urgently, how can this irreconcilable hatred comfort our gods? And the local governments of our provinces and cities should follow the central government's regulations, guide the people, implement them conscientiously, and fulfill their responsibilities of rescue to help our compatriots in need and assist our compatriots in what they cannot do. It is hoped that our soldiers and civilians will, from now on, increase their unity, swear to avenge their shame, love each other sincerely, and jointly avenge the country, establish a foundation for the survival, independence, and permanence of our nation! And complete our great mission of resisting aggression and building the country!</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Shanghai [Japanese] Disregards the Agreement, Disrupts the Rights of the Concession Police: The Municipal Council Sends a Letter to the Consular Body for Attention: Five People Kidnapped in the Concession Have Not Been Released <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 17th] Fan Kelin, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently protested to the Consular Body about the Japanese side's indiscriminate arrest of Chinese people in the Concession. He said that this action has clearly infringed on the powers of the Municipal Council and violated the agreement signed between the Japanese army and the Municipal Council, because the agreement stipulates that the Municipal Council police have the right to act independently in the Concession. The Municipal Council did not publish the full text of the protest letter, but published the following announcement: The Director-General of the Municipal Council recently wrote to the leading consul, urging the consular body to pay attention to the incident in which Japanese soldiers and military police arbitrarily arrested five Chinese people at the Fulai Hotel on Guangxi Road on May 9th. This action destroys the agreement established between the Japanese side and the Municipal Council, because the agreement stipulates that the police power of the Municipal Council is completely independent. The Director-General pointed out that the Municipal Council Police Department has worked hard to assist the Japanese side in investigating all actions called terrorist incidents, but in this incident, the Municipal Council was not informed at all, and the arrested persons were not extradited through the Municipal Council Police Station.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Arrested Persons are Now Detained in the Japanese Military Police Department <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] On the afternoon of the 9th, personnel from the Japanese Special Affairs Department (more than a dozen Japanese in plain clothes, two Chinese traitors, all armed) arrested five people directly at the Fulai Jewish Hotel at No. 159 Guangxi Road without notifying the Public Concession Police Department. It is now known that the Japanese side arrested these five people because they suspected that they were secretly planning to launch extensive guerrilla activities in Baoshan and Wusong, which are the bases of the Japanese army and navy. They were carried in three cars bearing the Shanghai Defense Army note to Hongkou and, it is said, have been detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. They are being strictly questioned about their activities. It is now known that the five arrested persons are: (1) Hong Guanghua, executive committee member of the 实山 County Party Department; (2) Wu Yi [character unclear], who previously worked in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters (not Wu Chuiying, but Mr. Wu has also disappeared); (3) Su Liangru, Chief of Staff of the Baoshan Guerrilla; (4) Chen Jiamo, the Baoshan County Magistrate appointed by Chongqing; and (5) Jiang Hao, a Shanghai New Life Guidance Instructor. Among them, four people were arrested in the first batch, and the fifth person was also arrested twenty minutes later. The Japanese authorities apparently wish to maintain silence on this matter, but the Japanese newspapers have praised the "excellent work" of the Army Special Affairs Department personnel in arresting Shanghai's "main anti-Japanese elements." Another report said that it is still unclear where the five people were taken and the reason for their arrest. However, one of the five arrested persons, Jiang Hao, was formerly a Shanghai New Life Movement instructor; another, Wu Chuiying, had previously served locally and, after the fall of his hometown after August 13th, opened the Yida Feng Rice Store in Hejin Road as a partnership for the sake of his family's livelihood, and also engaged in raw silk business on Shanghai's Connaught Road, making a small profit for a living. Another, Hong Guanghua, is now operating the Yuanlong Shipping Company in the Pudong Bank Building on Edouardo Road. The remaining two are said to be Su Liangru and Chen Jiamo.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai Dispatch: The Shanghai Groups Joint Office, regarding the incident of five Chinese people being lured and arrested by [Japanese] days ago, sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession on the 13th, saying that it is unknown why the five Chinese people were arrested. Even if there is evidence of guilt, it must go through legal procedures. Today, the Japanese arbitrarily kidnapped people, which is shocking and disregards the police power of the Concession. Not only is the safety of Chinese people's lives not guaranteed, but also the order and security of the Concession are endangered. If this trend is not stopped, the citizens in the Concession will be in danger. A special letter is sent requesting that the Municipal Council be asked to make serious representations to the Japanese side immediately, that the five Chinese people should be released immediately, and that it be guaranteed that the same incident will not happen again in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e9">National Production Conference: Chairman Chiang's Instructions (2) <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>First, we must concentrate capital and continue to expand production. Productive enterprises need capital. Today, we want to develop national capital, encourage private capital, and welcome foreign capital to expand wartime production. The enterprises that should be operated by the state have already been planned by the government. For private enterprises, the government has various measures to encourage and subsidize them. Welcoming foreign capital is also a consistent policy of the government. However, in the absence of large-scale foreign investment, we must also work hard ourselves. Many patriotic overseas Chinese have returned to invest in the country, and the government will definitely provide various subsidies and guarantees. However, there are still many entrepreneurs who are hesitant and waiting to see. I hope they understand the principle of "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair adhere to?" and quickly invest useful capital in the construction projects in the rear, so that capital will not be placed in a useless place. At the same time, it will also help the country. This is a great opportunity for entrepreneurs to develop their own businesses and contribute to the country. Entrepreneurs with a long-term vision must not miss it.</p>
<p>Second, today, in the military period, all production must be centered on national defense. You all know that Premier Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan is a national defense plan. Production cannot be separated from national defense, and national defense cannot be separated from production. In all industrially advanced countries, during wartime, all production immediately transforms the peacetime industrial system into a wartime industrial framework. This is called industrial mobilization. Since the War of Resistance, many of our factories have made great efforts for the war effort. This is your glory. However, because of the lack of planning and goals in the past, there are great shortcomings. The畸形 development along the coast has caused great damage to our entire industry. At the same time, we have not paid enough attention to the national defense industry and cannot keep up with the wartime needs. Now, most of the factories have moved to the southwest, and everything has to be started from scratch. But today, time is so urgent. What should we do? We must implement rationalization and adapt to the needs of national defense. Although the methods of our so-called rationalization and adaptation to the needs of national defense are different, the goals are the same, that is, to improve production efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Military Council Announces One Week's Battle Situation: Launching a Swift and Fierce Offensive, Repeatedly Capturing Cities, Creating a Brand New Situation on the Entire North-South Battlefield, May 8th to 14th <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] A spokesman for the Military Council stated that since our army launched offensives on all fronts recently, with the momentum of a swift and fierce wind, they have achieved the feat of seizing flags and killing generals. Important towns and famous cities have been repeatedly reported as recovered, creating a brand new and favorable situation on the entire north-south battlefield. In their panic and terror, the enemy has been trying desperately to salvage their defeated remnants this week. However, under our fierce attacks, they have suffered even greater losses. Major battle results are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>Hubei Province</p>
<p>In the Hubei region, the enemy forces of Fujita, Ogisu, and Fujie concentrated all their strength, launching a large-scale offensive with combined land and air forces from last week. After we employed mobile warfare tactics to lure the enemy into the mountainous areas of northern Hubei, completing the encirclement, a major annihilation battle was launched this week. It is estimated that over 2,000 enemies were killed in each of Tumenchong and Yinjadian, over 1,500 near Liujiahe, 3,000 on the left side of Qingtaizhen, over 1,000 in the battle of Liangjiashan, and over 2,000 opposite Xinjié Wanjia Mountain. A total of over 13,800 enemies were killed, and countless weapons and military supplies were seized. Simultaneously, our forces in central Hubei successively captured important locations such as Yangjiaze, Tailiwan, and Wamiaoji, cutting off the enemy's retreat. Our forces in southern Hubei once captured Xianning and Yanglousi, and twice captured Tongcheng. Our forces in eastern Hubei successively captured Echeng Gedian. Near Hankou, our forces also once captured Tuoluokou and Guodishan, taking advantage of the victory to rush into the main roads of Hankou, burning and destroying many supplies and provisions. The enemy in Wuhan is now trembling with fear, preparing day and night, without a moment's rest.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>Our various units advancing towards Nanchang have been fiercely attacking the defeated enemy with a posture of converging attacks for several days. Since capturing Shitou, Yaqiuling, and Fenghuang Mountain last week, and killing the enemy commander Suzuki Takayuki and over a thousand enemies, the enemy's offensive was greatly frustrated. We continued to pursue this week, capturing Shajing, Tushan, and Yanshan on the 8th, and approaching Shitoukou Niuxing on the 9th. Although the enemy reinforced and counterattacked, they were all defeated. At dawn on the 11th, we took advantage of the victory to rush into the city, resulting in fierce street fighting. The enemy stubbornly resisted to the death and were killed in large numbers by our gunfire. We also burned and destroyed military and gasoline warehouses, and after burning the barracks, we withdrew. The remnant enemy forces in Fengxin and Anyi are still tightly surrounded by us. The battle to capture the city of Hushan, north of Anyi city, continued fiercely on the evening of the 11th. The enemy between Wuning and Daqiaohe has been severely attacked for the past three days, with over 600 enemy casualties. The situation is now gradually calming down. On the 8th and 9th, a unit of our elite troops adopted miraculous tactics to launch a surprise attack on Pengze in order to coordinate. After two days and one night of bloody fighting, we successfully captured the two important points of Dingshan and Yangjiashan, approaching the city, making the enemy forces in Puchang, Wuning, Fengxin, and Anyi overwhelmed, panicked and at a loss.</p>
<p>Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Our army, operating in the suburbs of Zizhou, launched a rapid offensive with large units against the enemy besieged in the city starting on the 8th. The enemy stubbornly resisted in separate locations, suffering heavy casualties. On the morning of the 12th, they launched a surprise attack from Jiangcun towards Liuhua Bridge in the north of the city. The enemy was caught off guard and hurriedly responded. Our surprise troops circled behind the enemy and opened fire, killing over 600 enemies. The vanguard has now approached the city gates and is launching a fierce attack. The enemy forces in Zengcheng advanced towards Xiaolou on the 9th, but after a head-on attack, the enemy abandoned over 300 corpses and fled in disarray. All highway bridges between Zengcheng and Conghua have also been completely destroyed, cutting off enemy communication. Another unit of surprise troops took advantage of the situation to capture Fuhe, annihilating all 300 defending enemies. As for the enemy in Xinhui Jiangmen, on the morning of the 11th, our army, leading local armed forces, launched a three-pronged attack. The enemy desperately resisted but, after fierce fighting until noon, abandoned the city and fled. It was recaptured once again. In addition, over 500 enemies in Jiujiang, on the 10th, attempted to harass Yangbu from the southwest, encountering our attacking troops. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy abandoned over 200 corpses and retreated in disarray. We pursued them closely, capturing many.</p>
<p>Henan Province</p>
<p>Our army, which recaptured Meng County in northern Henan, has been advancing towards Wen County in the past few days, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy in the suburbs. Many were killed. On the 9th, the enemy forces in the city attempted to break through the north gate and flee, but they failed. We are continuing to encircle and annihilate them. Over 2,000 enemies in Bo'ai advanced towards Qiao Guo Fan Factory on the same day. After a courageous counterattack, we killed the enemy detachment commander Yamamoto and over 800 others. The traffic along the Daoqing line is now completely under our control, causing the remnant enemy forces in Xinyang, southern Henan, to be unable to cross the You River despite several attempts to break through to the west. Their strength is exhausted. However, starting on the 10th, enemies from Xinye, Tanghe, and Tongbai have ventured deep, attacking from various directions. Our officers and soldiers displayed great courage, encircling the enemy in each location and fiercely attacking them. In the battle of Xinye, over 1,000 enemies were killed. In the battle of Tanghe, 900 enemies were killed. Both of the above county towns have been lost and regained, enhancing our prestige. The enemy forces harassing the outskirts of Tongbai suffered countless casualties under our fierce artillery fire after a day-long battle on the 14th. Their attempt to attack our flank and echo the defeated enemy in northern Hubei has been completely crushed by this strong blow.</p>
<p>In addition</p>
<p>We recaptured Pizhou in northern Jiangsu, penetrated Andu in Anhui, attacked Qingyang, captured Dachen Fort in Suiyuan, pressed close to the suburbs of Lishi in western Shanxi, and successively captured Linqing and Feixian in Shandong. Due to our overall victory, puppet troops in various locations seized the opportunity to revolt and jointly kill the enemy in an endless stream. Important examples include the former puppet Security Corps in northern Hebei, led by Qiao Richeng, with over 1,300 men; the former puppet Imperial Army in Yongji, led by Xu Beizhai, with over 500 men; the former puppet Imperial Army in Linjin, led by Fan Dingbang, with over 800 men; the former puppet National Salvation Army in Hong County, led by Liu Yuchun, with over 200 men; and the former puppet Self-Government Army in Ji County, led by Li Zhonglin, with over 300 men. The total number is no less than 3,000 men, causing the enemy's treacherous scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese to increasingly fail. These are all major battle results in the past week and are worth a special report.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Fierce Battles in Central Hubei and Southern Henan for Two Weeks; We Hold the Advantage in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Northern Hunan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] Yicheng dispatch: The enemy's offensive from central Hubei and southern Henan has been thwarted after two weeks of bloody battles. We have recaptured Tanghe and are now continuing fierce battles with the enemy south of Tanghe and north of Suizhou and Zaoyang, as well as in the Changshoudian area north of Zhongxiang.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] According to military observers, it is still impossible to predict the changes in the Central China War, but due to the fierce resistance of the Chinese army on both sides of the Han River, the Japanese army has been unable to defend the Hanyi Highway. The current intention of the Japanese army seems to be to cut off the communication between the Chinese army and the rear, but so far it has not succeeded. The Japanese army seems to have advanced west from Sui County to the Han River, and then advanced along the east bank of the Han River in two routes, north and south respectively. The purpose of the northern army is to capture Yicheng and attack Xiangyang, and to unite with the Japanese army descending south to Tongbai in southern Henan to encircle the Chinese army in Xiangyang, Yingshan, and Sui County. According to one source, the Japanese army has reached Yicheng, but this has not been confirmed. As for the southern Japanese army, the purpose is highly anticipated after the Chinese army recovered Huamiaozhi near Zaoshi. Another route of the Japanese army descended south to Xiangyang via Xinye in southern Henan. It is said that Xinye was once lost, but it was soon recaptured by the Chinese army. The two armies are now holding each other fifty kilometers east of Xinye. Another attempt by the Japanese army is to disperse the strength of the Chinese army in the area, one in Yingshan and one in Xiangyang, and then slowly advance into Xiangyang, but the Chinese army is now prepared to deal with this plan. The fierce battle that occurred in Sui County recently is enough to show that the combat achievements of the Chinese army are admired by everyone. Because the number of Japanese troops is not large, the strength of the two armies is almost equal. It is heard that the Japanese army has decided to use bombing as a way to win, but what the result will be is unpredictable. The Chinese side also denies the Japanese propaganda on Qingbo Terrace, saying that the rumors that the Chinese army suffered heavy casualties are false.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 15th Special Dispatch] There are no major battles currently in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and northern Hunan. We hold the advantage in local skirmishes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] Shaanxi dispatch: The battle situation is calm. Along the Tongpu and Zhengtai lines, our guerrillas have recently launched several attacks on the enemy, achieving minor victories.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th Special Dispatch] Shandong dispatch: The enemy in Shandong is still guarding various transportation points. In local guerrilla warfare, we have killed over a thousand enemies in the past half month. The Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are often destroyed by us.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Su Zhichang's Reply: Adhering to Original Position; Advocating the Signing of a Tripartite Mutual Assistance Agreement; Granting Small Countries an Anti-Aggression Guarantee; Door to Negotiations Not Closed, Britain May Concede <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, London, 16th) According to political circles here, the Soviet Union's reply to Britain's proposal contains three points of Soviet objection:</p>
<p>(1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign a mutual assistance agreement.</p>
<p>(2) The military staff of the three countries should confer and establish detailed measures for a tripartite military agreement.</p>
<p>(3) All small countries along the Baltic Sea should be granted guarantees because, without this, the Soviet border there lacks protection and is insufficient to resist aggression.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The Soviet Union's reply to the British government's proposal has been delivered to London and is now being translated. Foreign Secretary Halifax and experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will study it on Tuesday and it is expected to be presented to the Cabinet for discussion on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] It is learned that the British government's reply to the recent Soviet document will be delivered to Moscow before the Geneva Conference. The Soviet proposal has been closely reviewed by the British government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th] The Soviet Foreign Minister delivered the Soviet government's reply to the British government to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union at midnight tonight. The Soviet Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador met for about half an hour, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. According to authoritative sources, the Soviet Union has expressed its inability to accept the British government's proposal, believing that the British government's proposal is not thorough and still maintains its original position. It is learned that the Soviet government's document to the British government insists on the establishment of a tripartite mutual assistance agreement and the provision of anti-aggression guarantees to the Baltic and Black Sea regions by the three countries. This is the main condition for cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western European countries. In addition, Izvestia also published an editorial today, unreservedly approving the agreement between Britain and Turkey, believing that this move can strengthen the defense of the Black Sea region without causing the Soviet Union to accept any restrictions, which is naturally welcomed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] Informed sources hope that the British and French Foreign Ministers can reach an agreement in the Geneva negotiations, and it is expected that Britain will make concessions. If an agreement cannot be reached, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's prestige at home will be affected. It is heard that when the House of Commons' foreign policy debate is held on Friday, opposition members will express their opinions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] During the meeting of the House of Commons today, various questions were raised regarding the British-Soviet negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that he is currently awaiting a document from the Soviet side, so he has nothing to add to what he announced to Parliament the other day. He further said that Foreign Secretary Halifax hopes to have the opportunity to meet with the Soviet representative attending the Geneva Conference to advance the British-Soviet negotiations. Mr. Zhang also insisted on his original position when answering some ancillary questions, saying that it is not appropriate to announce too much about the British-Soviet negotiations at this time, so he refused to express further opinions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th] A member of the House of Commons yesterday asked Undersecretary Butler what obligations Britain has to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and whether the British government has an obligation to assist the Soviet Union if the Soviet Union is drawn into a war to defend any of these three countries. The Undersecretary replied that Britain has no obligations to these three countries other than those stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>League of Nations General Assembly Approaching; Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to Confer; Soviet Ambassador to Britain Appointed to Attend</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, diplomatic circles here recently stated that although the Soviet government has de facto rejected the British proposal and insisted on its original position, this is not the country's final attitude. When the League of Nations Administrative Council meets on the 22nd of this month, the British and French Foreign Ministers and the Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar, Bo Danjin, will continue to confer, and it is certain that some achievements will be made at that time. In addition, the French government's proposal is closer to the Soviet Union's position, making it possible to establish a compromise.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The League of Nations Administrative Council has postponed its meeting to the 22nd of this month at the request of the Soviet government. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is scheduled to travel to Paris by plane on the 20th of this month to hold talks with Daladier and Bonet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 16th] It is learned that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has appointed Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky to represent the Soviet Union at next week's League of Nations meeting. According to general sources, Soviet Vice Foreign Commissar Bo Danjin will be selected to attend the international conference and will hold talks with Halifax and Bonet.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] In the House of Commons today, there was an inquiry as to where the British Ambassador to China, Kerr, had decided to locate the permanent embassy. Undersecretary Butler replied that the Ambassador believed that Shanghai was the most suitable place to maintain close contact with British interests, because Shanghai can take care of all parties and can visit the Chinese government in Chongqing from time to time, and can also inspect other locations with British consulates such as Peiping. Sir Milner, a Conservative member, requested a report on the seizure of the British ship Xigasi by the Japanese. Butler replied that the government had sent a note to the Japanese government regarding this matter and is now awaiting its reply, and stated that the ship is still in Japanese hands. When asked if there was a way to get the Japanese to return the ship, the Undersecretary replied that he would investigate the matter. Labor member Baker then asked if the Undersecretary had received reports regarding Japan building a submarine base in Yulin Port. The Undersecretary replied that he had received such reports, but they had never been officially confirmed; Baker then asked if the government could instruct local representatives to investigate the matter. Butler said that the government is in the process of investigating whether this report is true. The Labour MP Henderson then raised the issue of methods of warfare, asking whether the British government could jointly send a note to Japan with other countries regarding Japan's barbaric bombing of Chongqing, urging them to stop this kind of atrocity. Butler replied that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, had already issued a serious warning to the Tokyo government, stating that for the sake of human morality and Japan's own interests, it should instruct its air force to limit attacks to military targets. Ambassador Craigie observed that the victims of the Japanese air raid on Chongqing were almost all innocent civilians. According to Foreign Secretary Halifax, other ambassadors have also submitted similar notes to Japan. Mr. Henderson then said, "Can the League of Nations Administrative Council consider this matter and pass a resolution similar to the one passed by the General Assembly last September?" Butler replied that he would consider the matter, but there must be an initiator. Labour MP Sorensen then asked whether a reply had been received from the Japanese government. Parlett replied that there was, but it was not particularly related to this matter. Conservative Senator Bushby asked, "Regarding the safety of the British Embassy, ​​are there any special measures to be taken?" The Undersecretary replied that in the note to Japan, it was stated that the British Embassy was almost hit during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing. It was then asked whether the government had taken note of the fact that although the Japanese army had occupied several Chinese cities, the Chinese government was still able to promote the prosperity of industry in its provinces. Overseas Trade Department Undersecretary Cross replied that the government was well aware of this fact. It was then requested to explain what steps the British government had taken to promote the full cooperation between the British industrial community and the construction of this new China. Cross replied that the British government had done its best to assist all merchants who were willing to cooperate with China. Regarding the Japanese propaganda of anti-British movements in the occupied areas, Butler said that the British Consul General in Shanghai had negotiated with the Japanese on the spot. According to the Consul General's report, the anti-British propaganda has been reduced slightly, but it is still closely monitored, and protests will still be lodged with Japan if necessary. Undersecretary of the Department of India and Burma Movenheit replied regarding the road from Burma to China, saying that the government spent less than £28,000 on building the road, and all were taken from Burmese taxes. It was then asked whether serious consideration would be given to the defense of Burma in order to stop excessive Chinese immigration. He said that there was no need for this at present.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] The government has not yet made any statement regarding further actions to address the Danzig issue. Newspapers continue to publish news of Polish mistreatment of German expatriates.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] Newspapers here have intensified their anti-Polish propaganda starting today, claiming that Poles are attacking German expatriates. The "Evening News" reported that yesterday, Poles disrupted a prayer service at a German church with over a hundred people. Other attacks on Germans are particularly severe in Upper Silesia, it is said.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Paris reports that former Belgian Prime Minister Theunis has arrived in Paris.

He will also determine the scope of foreign capital that can be invested, but the hope of success is questionable as political guarantees are still needed.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Protests by Compatriots in Shanghai <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The compatriots in Shanghai ultimately possess backbone and courage. They are adept at adapting to the environment, carrying out all patriotic and national salvation work to support the war of resistance, and are skilled at striving for justice and freedom amidst hardship and danger with a spirit of great fearlessness. For example, in this instance, under the unreasonable threats of the Japanese, the authorities of the concessions adopted a policy of yielding. The compatriots in Shanghai, on the one hand, resolutely strengthened and expanded the anti-Japanese movement, and on the other hand, protested the humiliating policies of the concession authorities in the most appropriate manner, speaking with justice and confidence (see Central News Agency's dispatch of the 15th, "Japanese Arbitrarily Kidnap in Concessions, Shanghai Groups Jointly Protest"). Although the issue of the concessions can only be fundamentally resolved with the concrete implementation of sanctions against Japan by Britain, the United States, and France, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, has already protested to the Consular Body about the recent atrocities of the Japanese military in the concessions!</p>
<p>This spirit of arduous struggle among the compatriots in Shanghai is a manifestation of the great character of the Chinese nation and is also the foundation upon which the Chinese nation will ultimately defeat its *enemy*. However, those who are in a much better situation than Shanghai, *[text missing]*, and who take self-deprecation and self-humiliation as a source of joy, should feel ashamed when they see the words "citizens of the Republic of China!"</p>
<p>Does righteousness only reside in the compatriots in Shanghai? Are blood and backbone only bestowed upon the compatriots in Shanghai? *[text missing]*, can those who find themselves amidst evil and demonic forces learn to strive forward because of the compatriots in Shanghai?</p>
<h3 id="e24">Intensify Efforts to Secure Foreign Aid! <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The recent intimidation and adventurism of the Japanese *[text missing]* in the Far East primarily affect the democratic and peace-loving nations that have significant interests in the Far East, especially Britain. As long as the Japanese *[text missing]* continue their policy of aggression for one day, the contradictions between them and Britain, France, and the United States will intensify day by day.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, we must firmly seize every opportunity to promote the movement in Britain, France, and the United States to aid China and sanction Japan!</p>
<p>On the 15th, the British House of Commons reopened the debate on the situation in the Far East. This debate not only reflected the enthusiasm of the entire British public to resist the Japanese *[text missing]* but also more clearly and intensely expressed the enthusiasm of those in positions of political authority to aid China and sanction Japan. The British Secretary of Commerce also solemnly stated that the British government is determined to support Sino-British industrial cooperation.</p>
<p>This situation is, of course, not only the case in Britain—according to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 17th, it is also said that political circles in Britain believe that the League of Nations conference will likely pass proposals for further assistance to China!</p>
<p>However, where are our efforts? Where is our national diplomatic movement? Where is the mobilization of our public opinion circles? As the war of resistance and national construction face a new and difficult stage, we must quickly unite, support the government, seize opportunities, and strive for foreign aid to complement the progress of domestic military, political, and economic construction, and inflict a greater and more fatal blow on the Japanese *[text missing]*!</p>

<h3 id="e25">Preparing for a Rainy Day: British Resident Registration to Be Completed by the End of the Month; Chinese Registration to Be Implemented During the Day; British Registration Already Seventy to Eighty Percent Complete, Many are Specialized Technical Personnel; Three New British Warships Arrive in Hong Kong to Increase Defenses, Aircraft Carrier to Return to Hong Kong Within Days <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities, due to the unstable current situation, are taking precautions. In order to prepare for a rainy day, in addition to strengthening Hong Kong's naval, land, and air defenses, they are also implementing British registration and voluntary Chinese registration, so that in case of need, sufficient personnel can be provided. British registration has already begun and is scheduled to end on the 31st of this month. The Hong Kong government attaches great importance to this matter. Since the start of the registration, notices have been published in Western newspapers and advertisements have been displayed on trams and buses, advising British residents to complete registration within two weeks. Yesterday, the authorities again displayed advertisements on trams and buses, stating that the 31st of this month is the deadline for registration, and those who have not yet registered should do so as soon as possible and not wait any longer. In recent days, there has been a very enthusiastic response from British residents to register. As of recently, seventy to eighty percent of the British residents in Hong Kong have registered, and the remaining twenty to thirty percent are expected to register before the 31st of this month. Many of the registered British residents are technical personnel, especially those skilled in general mechanics and wireless technology. It is said that the authorities intend to summon each registered person for an interview after the registration is completed to test whether the information reported on the registration form is accurate, in preparation for future needs. Furthermore, dozens of the British residents who have registered this time participated in various aspects of the European War of 1914 to 1918, and several even participated in frontline work in France. As for the voluntary registration of Chinese, all forms and booklets have now been printed and will begin during the day, without waiting for the British registration to be completed before proceeding. In addition, in order to strengthen Hong Kong's defense capabilities, the British Admiralty has dispatched a new minelayer and two river gunboats to Hong Kong. The three ships are scheduled to arrive by the end of the month. The minelayer is the latest type, weighing 498 tons, named HMS Clide, and the gunboats are also newly equipped, one named Dragonfly and one named Gadfly, each weighing 585 tons and equipped with 4-inch guns, each with 74 sailors. In addition, the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, after going to Singapore for exercises last year, entered the Singapore dry dock for repairs and has now been completed. It will leave Singapore and return to Hong Kong within a few days, escorted by the HMS Courageous. Also, when the HMS Gadfly was en route to Hong Kong, it encountered the East Asia Steamship Company's 4,812-ton mail ship SS Alesia, which sails between Singapore and Europe, and the ship caught fire. HMS Gadfly immediately sailed to rescue the ship. At the same time, the P&amp;O ship SS Canton, which was also in port bound for Europe, joined the rescue efforts, and the two ships together rescued more than one hundred passengers and crew members. The details of the ship's fire are currently unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Bloody Fight in Ap Lei Chau; Police Investigate Strictly; More Than Ten Detectives Were Dispatched to the Scene of the Incident Yesterday to Inquire; Scavenger Xiao Cai's Injury Worsens and His Life Is in Danger <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>A bloody and tragic incident of brutal fighting occurred in Ap Lei Chau, Aberdeen, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, the 15th. The details of the incident were reported in yesterday's newspapers. After the incident occurred, the police authorities, believing that such a brutal and bloody tragedy should not be allowed to occur in a region governed by the rule of law in Hong Kong, dispatched more than ten detectives to the Dat Shu Wan area of Ap Lei Chau yesterday morning to strictly investigate the origin of the tragedy. Once evidence of the incident is found, those who have been detained will be charged. It was found that Xiao Cai, a sanitation worker from the Cleansing Bureau, deeply concerned that a bloody tragedy would occur due to the willingness of both sides to engage in private fighting, stepped forward to act as a peacemaker, hoping to resolve the conflict into goodwill. However, like the fire at the city gate affecting the fishpond, he was struck in the abdomen by a wooden stick wielded by one of the fighting parties, causing serious injury on the spot. He was immediately taken to the Matilda Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injury to his abdomen, treatment was difficult. His spirit had not changed much in the morning, but by the afternoon, his condition worsened, and his life is now in danger. In addition to the death of Liu Qiu, one of the injured, a total of eight people were injured in the fight. Xiao Cai suffered the most severe injury. If he does not receive treatment, it will turn into a tragic incident of two deaths and seven injuries. Furthermore, it was found that the bloody fight was between Hakka people from Huizhou who grow vegetables in Dat Shu Wan (south of Ap Lei Chau) and Cantonese shipbuilding workers from the Ho Hing Shipyard in Ap Lei Chau. Although nearly a thousand people from Xiamen live in Ap Lei Chau, they did not participate in the fight.</p>

<p>Children's Welfare Branch</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association is scheduled to hold a children's carnival on the 20th of this month in the open space next to the Peninsula Hotel. The construction of the evening venue has already begun yesterday. All expenses are donated by the manager of the Tung Wah Hospital, Yang Yongkang. On the day of the event, there will be horseback riding, movies, fishing, "hit the traitors," and various other games. The program is very rich. There will also be a costume show featuring Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern costumes, all performed by the orphans of the association. There will also be a refreshment area to cater to the needs of the guests. The event will be held from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Tickets are 50 cents. The association is also scheduled to hold a children's carnival at the villa of Sir Robert Ho Tung at 254 Peak Road from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM on June 3rd.

It is hoped that people will participate enthusiastically to raise more funds. All the valuable prizes for the above two events will be displayed at Lane Crawford today. Baptist Church Boys' Brigade</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Christian Baptist Church Boys' Brigade, considering the urgent need for treatment for the wounded soldiers bravely fighting on the front lines, has organized a service group to return to the various war zones to provide services. They are also scheduled to hold a charity bazaar at St. Paul's Boys' College on the 21st and 22nd of this month to raise relief funds. The preparations are proceeding very actively. It is hoped that major companies, manufacturers, and stores will donate goods to support the charity. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life will participate enthusiastically.

Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote has agreed to serve as the honorary president of the association and has donated $50 in advance as a start.

<h3 id="e29">Hong Kong and British Territories Discuss Establishing Wireless Telephone <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Wireless telephone is an essential tool for modern communication. Therefore, major cities in various countries have this equipment. Major cities in the Far East have also joined the wireless telephone communication network one after another. Singapore will start establishing a wireless telephone line from Singapore to North America on June 1st. After that, Hong Kong is the only major commercial port in the Far East that does not have this equipment. The wireless telephone in Japan has already established contact with various countries in the world, and Shanghai could communicate with North America and Europe before the war. Manila and Batavia have direct connections to the United States and the Netherlands. However, Hong Kong is uniquely lacking. Recognizing this, the Wireless and Wired Telegraph Company has begun discussions with the Hong Kong authorities and the British government to establish a wireless telephone communication network between Hong Kong and the territories of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Since the start of our country's sacred War of Resistance, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have been continuously contributing money and effort to help their motherland. Their enthusiastic and righteous spirit is admirable. The Overseas Chinese Relief Association of Southeast Asia organized two teams a month ago to return to the country and serve in Dongjiang. Now, Guan Wensen, a prominent overseas Chinese in Kuala Lumpur, has established the Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps and a Women's Ambulance Team (entirely *[sic]*). They arrived in Hong Kong from Southeast Asia and will depart for Dongjiang within a few days to serve in the interior.

<h3 id="e33">To Facilitate Visits to the United States to See the Exhibition, Imperial Airways Launched a Special Air-Sea Combination Ticket <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate people from Hong Kong to visit the New York World's Fair, Imperial Airways has set new fares that are very low. It takes 13 days to travel from Hong Kong to the United States, and the total fare is £149.10. Fly from Hong Kong to Singapore, connect with the local Imperial Airways, and arrive at Southampton, England, in eight days. There are 15 shipping companies there that can carry passengers across the Atlantic to New York. The three giant liners, the Queen Mary of Britain, will participate in carrying passengers by plane to the United States after carrying the British King and Queen back to England from Canada. This plan covers Hong Kong, Siam, Malaya, Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, East Africa, and South Africa in the East, and North America in the West. Therefore, people in the above-mentioned places can purchase this special combined air-sea ticket from the local general agency. As an example, assume a passenger departs from Singapore by plane on May 9 and arrives in Southampton on the 17th, and takes the Queen Mary, which departs for New York on the same day, and then leaves New York on the Queen Mary on the 26th and arrives in Southampton on the 29th, and then flies to Singapore on the same day. The fares are as follows (round trip is the same price): Hong Kong to New York £149.10, Singapore to New York £145, Rangoon to New York £140.10, Nairobi, East Africa, to New York £127.10.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Responding to the Spirit of General Mobilization: National Oath in Macau <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>By—Huan Tang</p>
<p>Feature Article</p>
<p>The beacon fire of the *Incident* has awakened the sleeping lion of centuries. The angry tide of national defense and resistance has surged up in the blue sky. Every filial son and virtuous grandson of the Chinese people is striving for national independence and survival, and is passionately moving toward justice. They have all directly or indirectly devoted their loyalty and prepared to sacrifice everything for the sacred war.</p>
<p>Now, the War of Resistance has entered a favorable new stage. In order to cope with and realize this difficult transitional period and approach the final victory and the free and happy world, the Chinese nation, under the leadership of the supreme leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, is launching a general mobilization of the national spirit. The spirit combined with matter—it is an even more powerful torrent in China's future war of resistance. This torrent will spread from South China *[sic]* and West China to East China and North China, flowing across the Yalu River and rushing to Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Macau—because of its special political relationship, it can be considered a safe zone in South China *[sic]* after the outbreak of the war. However, the emotions of the overseas Chinese have, fortunately, not been completely tainted by safety and buried their innocent hearts. They have contributed considerable spiritual and material resources to their motherland in the past, and the motherland, of course, also feels a sense of comfort for this orphan overseas.</p>
<p>Here, the Four Circles Relief Association is one of the representatives. Now, in order to respond to the national spirit mobilization, it specially held a national covenant oath on the seaside of the Bay on the other day, the Bay Elementary School. After the association members rushed to take care of it beforehand, hundreds of people who came to the scene on the day were students, members of the association, and overseas Chinese in Macau. The economic situation was overwhelming. This group of the motherland is the epitome of the political progress of the Chinese nation and a powerful cornerstone for winning the final victory.</p>
<p>In a small school with a low and high *[sic]* that is arranged *[sic]*, in front of the door is a white forehead with red characters, the virtue is that the old locust with a few skills in front of the land, the red and green reflect the swaying spring breeze. Sitting in the hall is a group of excellent and promising young men and women, orderly and silent. After the ceremony, the chairman announced the reasons for the meeting. Then, the representative of the Macau Direct Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, the supervisor, delivered a speech. Then, representatives from all walks of life gave speeches, each with emotional words, inspiring meaning, and the hearts of the people were really alienated from the shell of the body, and they had already galloped to the suffering motherland. In *[sic]* and solemn *[sic]* air, in order to exhaust loyalty and protect the motherland, the national covenant began to be sworn in.</p>
<p>Everyone in the venue stood up, raised their right hand, and the chairman first read out the oath, followed by chanting the covenant. Everyone spoke in unison, and the sound was like gold and stone. Finally, representatives from all walks of life wielded their pens on the spot and jointly judged the judgment—the final victory of the Chinese nation is indeed a powerful guarantee.</p>
<p>In the evening, the comrades of the association still had unfinished business "There, they held a wildfire conference. In an open space surrounded by thousands of people, a group of young men and women were preparing to express meaningful texts in action and promote the great meaning of the War of Resistance. There are the Singing Arts Corps, including the exiled 1, 2, and 3, and the Sacrifice is at the Final Moment, and the National Salvation March. There are performances by the Rise Children's Troupe of "××××" and "××××." The Youth Service Corps's "Northeast Roar," "Qiluo Music," and "Our Hometown." Among them, especially "Northeast Roar" is about saving people's provinces, mobilizing *[sic]*. At that time, the atmosphere of the whole field was silent. Perhaps the emotions of the audience were too deeply stimulated. It was not until about eleven o'clock in the middle of the night that a group of comrades hugged their strong hearts and left the meeting and returned.</p>

The publicity department includes an editorial committee (three members) and liaison, art, and publication sections. The research department includes collection, current affairs, investigation, study, and practice sections. The film department includes photography, developing, printing, and storage sections. Each department also has several secretaries to assist in everything, making every effort to apply the principle of division of labor and cooperation so that everyone has something to do. Looking back, general groups are not also "customarily" similarly organized, but "it depends on the people" and the effect is different.</p>
<p>What kind of talent makes up "Zhong Jiu?" Readers will surely immediately recall Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Lin Shu, and Fan Zheng. Yes, these four symbolize the meaning of the entire people, regardless of gender or age, fighting against the war. (Although Mr. Lin Shu is not old, based on his experience and age, he is clearly an elder in the group, and it is not inappropriate to call him "Old Dan.") However, the other companions are all shrewd, capable, and versatile specialized talents. The reporter saw some of them installing electrical appliances, some filming, some making scenery and props, and some drafting manuscripts and writing articles... a group of capable people, all indispensable talents for the group.</p>
<p>Regarding their lifestyle, the group's expenses are donated by government officials and close friends who sympathize with them. Each person receives only three yuan per month for pocket money. If the group's finances are difficult, they may even receive a discount or "unpaid salary." They do everything themselves, and they even take turns cooking. This kind of enjoyment is completely opposite to their past lives as stars or university students; however, they have been influenced by the brave soldiers and the vast number of compatriots, and they deeply feel that this kind of life is the "Chinese" life, a life with life and soul, and also symbolizes the glorious future of the Chinese nation. The sudden change in lifestyle among the petty bourgeoisie and intellectuals, and the overcoming of inferior habits, is a praiseworthy phenomenon of progress since the war of resistance. The "Zhong Jiu" friends are a part of the many progressive young people.</p>
<p>Their daily life: from 7:00 to 7:30 is morning assembly, which includes current affairs reports, reading reports, life reviews, and work assignments. This is followed by reading and group discussions. After lunch, they work in the office and rehearse plays. The evening is for free creative work. Unless it is Sunday, members cannot leave the group. Now, because they are busy preparing for the public performance, even Sundays have been canceled. Whether at the front line or in Hong Kong, they are always working collectively and receiving collective education.</p>
<p>Their group has three rules: (1) Only collective action, no individual action, sharing life and death, joy and sorrow; (2) Absolute transparency in all internal and external affairs; (3) Refusal of all public and private banquets unrelated to work. There are also four maxims: intense work, strict life, clear finances, and pure attitude.</p>
<p>The reporter carefully observed their lives and deeply felt that these covenants and creeds are fully expressed in their actual lives. When they are at morning assembly, unnecessary chatter is set aside. Everyone practices Mandarin and learns phonetic symbols with the same spirit as primary and middle school students. Even Mr. Lin Shu follows the "youngsters" in practicing to correct his incorrect pronunciation, talking and laughing, harmoniously and happily, truly making onlookers envious.</p>
<p>Usually, Group Leader Jin Shan is just like everyone else, and everyone calls him "Old Jin"—"Old Jin"—but when reciting lines or rehearsing a play, if there is something wrong, he very seriously tells his partners, with a very serious and natural attitude. Everyone also politely asks him for advice when they encounter problems, with genuine feelings flowing between them.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, the reporter saw how loving and sincere they were while putting on makeup, taking photos, and setting up the backstage. Some were braving the heavy rain to fetch clothes from the dormitory, putting public affairs on their shoulders. Putting on makeup, I help you, you help me, the matter is everyone's. Because they were taking photos all night, tired friends would lie down anywhere. Passing friends, afraid that they would catch a cold, would cover them with two pieces of clothing. Sharing the same boat, they were even closer than siblings. The reporter has seen many groups, but rarely one like "Zhong Jiu." After happily reporting to readers, at the end of this article, I wish young friends to learn from their example; may they cherish themselves for the country and work hard; and may they grow up well.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Expanding Publicity for the Provincial Games, Promoting People's Armed Self-Defense; Various Counties and Cities Organize Publicity and Political Training Work Groups; Conducting Mass Training to Strengthen the Spirit of Struggle <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express) After the Japanese bandits extended their claws into South China, every Guangdong compatriot must earnestly take responsibility for protecting their homes and villages. In the occupied areas, especially, we must rise up to fight back. The Guangdong Provincial Games, in order to firmly establish the people's belief in "inevitable victory in the war of resistance," strengthen the people's spirit of sacrifice and struggle, launch a people's armed movement, resist the Japanese bandits, and defend our homeland, will engage in mobilizing all party members and the masses to assist the province's self-defense corps in publicity and political training work. In various counties and cities, they will organize mass anti-Japanese self-defense corps publicity and training work groups to take charge of mobilization. The steps for implementation are as follows:</p>
<p>Publicity Aspects</p>
<p>A. Mobilizing and Organizing: 1. Contact and summon various work teams in the county or stationed in the county to discuss and determine publicity methods, publicity locations, team assignments, and departure dates, and separately carry out publicity in the villages. 2. Contact local middle schools to organize students or enthusiastic intellectual youths into several publicity teams, with five to seven people per team, to regularly depart for rural areas on holidays for publicity. 3. Contact local primary and secondary school teachers and students to organize visiting groups, with three to five people per group, to regularly visit ordinary households and gentry and wealthy families on holidays for publicity and guidance. B. Preparing Materials: 1. Simple maps and photos of Japanese bandits committing atrocities. 2. Simple leaflets and popular wall newspapers. 3. Photos of guerrillas and all heroic sacrifices related to the war of resistance. 4. The above photos can be collected from local schools or drawn by school students. C. Utilizing Opportunities: 1. Utilize gatherings to invite local enthusiastic celebrities and scholars to give speeches. 2. Utilize village gatherings and temple festivals to assign publicity teams to depart for publicity. 3. Utilize welcome rallies for soldiers on expeditions to expand publicity. 4. Utilize other institutions to launch publicity anytime, anywhere. D. Publicity Methods: Should be adapted to the times and to the people, utilizing various publicity methods. 1. Adapting to the People: For example, use storytelling methods for women and children, discuss business management methods for merchants, and discuss improved farming and rural life methods for farmers, etc. 2. Adapting to the Times: For example, in spring publicity, you can use lion dances to summon the masses. In summer, you can use evening concerts or singing to summon the masses. Other methods suitable for local customs and practices can be determined independently. 3. Lecture or educational style gatherings are both acceptable.</p>
<p>Training Methods</p>
<p>A. Mass Training: 1. Holding Self-Defense Publicity Classes: 1. Supported by principals or head teachers of senior primary schools, in conjunction with township chiefs and district leaders, holding self-defense publicity classes. 2. Each public or private primary school in famous villages must hold one self-defense publicity class and must regularly and continuously operate it. 3. Each self-defense publicity class is limited to sixty to eighty people. 4. The training period for each self-defense publicity class is limited to two weeks, with training hours limited to 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM daily. However, this can be changed according to local conditions. 5. Each village and school should hold two self-defense publicity classes each month, and at least twenty classes per year, and must continue to hold them until all out-of-school men, women, young and old in the village have completed training. 6. The methods and teaching materials for the self-defense publicity classes will be ordered and distributed by the provincial capital. 2. Holding Night Meetings: 1. Presided over by township chiefs, in conjunction with primary school teachers in the township, holding village night meetings. 2. Night meetings should be held on the fifteenth night of each lunar month. 3. The purpose of holding night meetings is to publicize people's efforts in self-defense and resistance, contributing money, guns, and labor, and to narrate war conditions in various places and add recreational activities. 4. Night meeting speakers can be pre-arranged, or the township chief and primary school teachers can be responsible. 5. The night meeting location can be temporarily designated, or rotated between districts for comprehensive coverage. B. Self-Defense Corps Training: 1. The county (city) publicity and training corps, in conjunction with self-defense corps leaders, determine the political training lesson time. The political training content is divided into literacy lessons and political training lessons, two subjects. 2. The county (city) publicity and training corps should send letters to local primary and secondary school staff, teachers, party department workers, heads of institutions, and enthusiastic intellectuals to separately teach the self-defense corps political training lessons, each person taking one to two hours per week. 3. Send a letter to the local middle school student union to send high-achieving students to teach self-defense corps literacy lessons. The Three Principles of the People literacy textbook can be used. 4. The county (city) publicity and training corps should consult with the self-defense corps leaders to set up a library and reading room in the self-defense corps headquarters. The materials and reading materials will be collected by the publicity and training corps. 5. Political training in the self-defense corps must be carried out regularly. However, if the number of people is too large, they can be divided into teams for rotation training, with one term every three months.</p>

On the 13th and 14th nights, dozens of our team members broke in late at night and killed more than a dozen Japanese and puppet soldiers. Afterwards, over a hundred Japanese troops came from the west gate to reinforce them. Our team retreated calmly. The Japanese troops are now very wary of our plainclothes teams.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] Li, Chairman of Guangdong Province, commended the Paijiang Self-Defense Corps in Qingyuan County for their heroic resistance. In November of last year, when the Japanese attacked Jietou town, over two thousand members of the Paijiang Self-Defense Corps engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese for four days and nights. Hundreds of villages and shops near the battlefield were destroyed. The corps members fought fearlessly and eventually repelled the Japanese. After this battle, the Japanese continued to invade from time to time, and the local corps made repeated efforts to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese, which is highly commendable. In addition to providing relief to the casualties, it has been approved that the measures for providing relief to the casualties of the people who fought in the resistance be implemented. The individuals who participated in the battles and made outstanding contributions should be rewarded separately to show encouragement. 3,000 provincial dollars will be specially allocated by the provincial government, with 1,000 dollars as bonuses for those who contributed to the resistance and 2,000 dollars as a reserve fund for anti-Japanese supplies. These funds will be entrusted to responsible local gentry and merchants for safekeeping. In the event of another Japanese invasion, they will be allocated to the members participating in the anti-Japanese corps for food. Yesterday, Mo Xiong, the administrative inspector of the Sixth District, was ordered to send personnel to collect the funds and forward them to the Qingyuan County Government for proper handling.</p>

<p>[East River Express] After our Eastern Route Army recovered Fuhe Market on the Zengcong Line, they continued to advance westward, putting pressure on the Japanese troops at Zhongxin Market on the Fucong Highway, and attacking the Zhucun and other strongholds on the Guangzeng Highway. According to the Japanese troops in Zengcheng, fearing that their retreat route would be cut off, and with Zhongxin gradually becoming unsustainable under the control of our army, the Zengcheng Japanese troops urgently requested assistance from Guangzhou. However, Guangzhou had no troops to spare, so they reluctantly drew troops from Zengcheng to reinforce Zhongxin. Yesterday on the 11th, over 500 Zengcheng infantry and over 50 horses set out from Pengwu to Zhongxin, with the aim of defending this point to the death to protect the Fucong Highway and prevent our army from advancing westward from Fuhe. It is reported that our army is also prepared to launch a major encirclement and annihilation of the Japanese troops in Zhongxin.</p>

<p>[Shiqi Express] There have been quite a few rumors in Zhongshan recently, and people's hearts are unsettled. According to Yuan Dai, commander of the First District Guerrilla Special Operations Detachment, Zhongshan is bordered by the sea on three sides, and ships come and go, whether many or few. Our defense has always paid unremitting attention. As for the Japanese bandits' harassment, there have been no fewer than a hundred times since the war of resistance, and they have all been repelled by our loyal and brave teams. The coast is currently peaceful, and the hearts of the people in the county are stable. According to intelligence from various departments, there has been no unusual activity from the Japanese warships. The rumors may be caused by misrepresentations from other places. Our defense is consolidated, and coastal surveillance is tight. Even if the Japanese invade, they will certainly not succeed.</p>
<p>[Zhongshan Express] Since Wu Fei arrived in the county to take over as Commander of the Sixth District Guerrilla Forces, the headquarters has been officially established. A telegram was sent to Li, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and Zhang, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, to report that Commander Wu has taken over and is strengthening Zhongshan's defense and completing war preparedness measures within a limited time. On the 13th, he informed the county government and ordered the district and village heads to immediately dispatch able-bodied men, 20 to 50 from each village, to rotate in various districts and concentrate in a certain place to be assigned to defense engineering work. Everything related to local wartime relief equipment and measures has also been largely completed. Commander Wu will soon begin to reorganize the teams and strengthen the people's armed forces.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Express] The Women and Children Service Corps, which was previously established in Guangning, has been ordered to conduct continuous training for some time. They have also recruited the female recruits' team and juvenile refugees, organized them into cadres, and managed them with military means. Their achievements are outstanding. Yesterday, the Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association summoned Chen Rushu, the head of the corps, to Shaoguan, seemingly to expand the organization so that it can broadly recruit motivated women and work closely with the women's work team of the New Life Movement to engage in rear-area work. Assisting the provincial relief committee in rescuing war orphans may increase assistance.</p>

<p>[Fangcheng Express] On the 4th of this month, two or three gunshots suddenly came from the waters off Huanwei, Fangcheng. After investigation, it was learned that three Japanese transport ships had sailed to the outside of Bailongwei late last night and were anchored in the waters off Huanwei, approximately ten thousand meters from the shore. This area is where our country's territorial waters meet Annam, which belongs to the French. At dawn, each of the three transport ships fired a cannon as a signal. Soon, more than a dozen Annamese sailing ships, loaded with white rice, sailed into the ship, unloaded the rice, and then the Japanese ships fled. According to reliable sources, Japanese transport ships come to this sea every two or three days to pick up food. After firing cannons, Annamese sailing ships will transport rice to supply them. It is said that they have transported three or four times this year. According to refugees from Weizhou, there are still over a hundred Japanese soldiers on the island, who have been busy building air defense works over the past month, and they are oppressing the compatriots on the island in every possible way, as in the past. On the 7th, a double-smokestack Japanese vessel robbed one of our variant-masted salt boats in the waters of Guantouling and sailed to Weizhou, where they unloaded all the salt on the ship and landed it.</p>

During the meeting, Commissioner Zhang gave instructions regarding the work the people should do for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, as well as the recent military and political measures of the Commissioner's Office, explaining everything in detail. This was followed by speeches from Commander Zheng and Inspector Zhou. Finally, County Magistrate Wang and Deputy Commander Zou also gave speeches. In the end, the village work team presented a flag to Commissioner Zhang, embroidered with the four characters "National Vanguard." The Commissioner then led thousands of people to Lianjiang's coastal areas for an exercise, enhancing team combat techniques.</p>

When a customer is too drunk to drive, they are asked if they want a 'Cavalier' to escort them home. If they need one, we immediately call us. We will send an employee in evening dress to quickly rush to that place, help the drunk person into the car, and safely send them home. This service does not stop for a moment in 24 hours a day."</p>
<p>It is said that the establishment of "The Cavaliers" has been approved by the police and several nightclubs and hotels, because with this team, car accidents can be reduced a lot.</p>

<p>After arriving in Hollywood, Hedy Lamarr achieved success with "Algiers," co-starring Charles Boyer. Her new film, "I Take This Woman," co-starring Spencer Tracy, has recently been completed, but the producers and directors are very dissatisfied with the film. They would rather stop its release than ruin the future of the female artist in whom Hollywood has placed great hope. Thus, Hedy Lamarr's six months of hard work have been in vain.</p>
<p>The reason for the film's failure can be seen in Spencer Tracy's comments when asked about his impression of Hedy Lamarr. He said, "The strangest thing in the plot is that I am forced to reject the pursuit of the most beautiful woman in Hollywood today. She is pursuing me, and I am avoiding her. This is ridiculous. They (referring to the producers, etc.) do not know that soon after, this unreasonable plot will ruin the future of a female artist whom they regard as a treasure."</p>
<p>The only thing that can comfort Hedy Lamarr now is her marriage to screenwriter Gene Markey. Although her love life is good, her fate is lamentable.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Who Will Ultimately Own the Xuhe Cup? South China and the Navy Clash Again, Meeting at Jia Hill This Afternoon at 4:30 PM, Leung Wing-chiu and Lai Siu-wing's Foot Injuries Have Recovered and They Can Play <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special) The summer heat is like a burning fire, originally unsuitable for intense football exercise. Therefore, the five championship competitions organized by the General Association were concluded at the end of last month.</p>
<p>However, the Xuhe Cup remains unresolved and a championship battle must be held at Jia Hill today. Moreover, there is a charity match between South China and the Hong Kong League this Saturday, so during this period, football matters are in a state of flux.</p>
<p>Last Saturday was originally the time to resolve who would own the Xuhe Cup, but because several South China players had foot injuries and could not fight with a complete lineup, they tied the Navy with a score of one each. The honor was 'not yet clearly assigned', so there will be another showdown today.</p>
<p>The battle location is still at Jia Hill, starting at 4:30 PM. If a winner has not been decided after the full 70 minutes, extra time will be added. Because South China is leaving for a southern tour soon, it cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>It is said that Leung Wing-chiu and Lai Siu-wing have recovered from their foot injuries and can play today. Therefore, the arranged lineup is more complete than last time. On the Navy side, because the battleship 'Simple Number' has left Hong Kong, the front line lacks Moore. Judging from this, South China's strength has increased, while the Navy's has weakened. Comparing the two, South China's chances of victory are very high.</p>
<p>First, list the two lineups, and then talk about other things.</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Cheung Wing-choi, Lee Kwok-wai, Lee Tin-sang, Lau Hing-choi, Leung Wing-chiu, Kwok Ying-kee, Yeung Shui-yik, Lai Siu-wing, Fung King-cheung, Yip Bak-wah, Tang Kwong-sam</p>
<p>Substitutes: Leung Pak-wai, Tse Kam-hung, Lee Yan-leung, Law Dou-man</p>
<p>Navy</p>
<p>Dickason, Hannaway, Handley, Hannaway, Callia, Cooper, , Morris, Tobin, Rocktoran</p>
<p>With Wing-chiu in the center, the strength of assistance in attack and defense will definitely increase. With Siu-wing on the front line, the progress will be more sharp. The reason why South China has not won seven times is that the front line lacked Siu-wing and used Kwok Ying-kee instead, so the entire connection was not fully realized. This time, with Siu-wing playing, the cooperation of each player will be fully developed to try to win.</p>
<p>With Siu-wing participating in the battle, Ying-kee will be transferred to left midfielder. He is quick and good at passing, which is similar to Lau Hing-choi on the right. Under the cover, the front line players can get suitable passes and will be more active.</p>
<p>Lee Kwok-wai has been getting better and better since taking over Mack Shao-han's position. It is an obvious improvement after changing his style.</p>
<p>Today, South China's strategy for advancing should not adopt the central breakthrough method. Fung King-cheung is good at dribbling, but not good at charging. If this method is adopted, it will not be appropriate. Moreover, Cooper, the Navy's center forward, is experienced, good at positioning, and not good at attacking. His responsibility is more defense than attack. Therefore, King-cheung should use his flexible feet to lure Cooper out, weaken his defensive power, and then use flanking attacks from the left and right. Then there is no need to worry about not being able to attack.</p>
<p>However, South China still uses Yeung Shui-yik on the left wing instead of Law Dou-man. This seems inappropriate. It is said that the reason for not using Dou-man is that he is too negligent in his responsibilities. When he gets the ball, he has no suitable pass or successful dribbling, and he misses more opportunities than he creates. Therefore, Shui-yik is still used, but it is hoped that Shui-yik's performance today will not be as unsatisfactory as last time, so as not to disappoint the selectors.</p>
<p>In short, if South China can fight with the above lineup, it will definitely win and the creation of winning the championship can be completed. If substitutes are used instead of the original lineup, then victory will definitely not be easy. (Football Field Grand Duke)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Men's Basketball Grade A Championship Finally Won by South China, Yesterday Winning Over Star Island 44 to 43 <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The public men's basketball Grade A match, Star Island vs. South China, was held last night to determine the champion. Both sides went all out as their very existence depended on the outcome, and the general fans cheered loudly for the team they supported. Therefore, between gains and losses, the sound shook the roof tiles. During the forty-minute fierce competition, the atmosphere was in extreme tension. As a result, South China defeated Star Island with a score of 44 to 43 and won the championship this year. Star Island sighed that fate was lacking.</p>
<p>South China's ability to achieve this record was due to the team's tacit coordination and the unremitting efforts of each member. Whether in space or time, they never let go easily. Although Shek Chun-chi was tightly marked and could not fully reveal his true colors, he had fulfilled his responsibilities. Chan Sun-kau's dribbling and charging were fierce and unparalleled, creating many shooting opportunities. Ma Kit-man was both intelligent and brave, able to attack empty positions and was extremely outstanding. Luk Yan-king and Shek Chun-dat repeatedly seized the opponent's passes, frustrating the enemy's attack, and as a defender, repeatedly attacked the front to shoot. His performance was the best in the team. It is a pity that Li Pui-chek and Leung Kwok-tok took advantage of this. However, the team's passing was done with short distances or bouncing the ball to avoid interception by the opponent, and the speed of passing could avoid everything. All positions rotated, making the opponent unable to grasp the situation. However, throwing the ball still lacked skill.</p>
<p>Star Island's Leung Kwok-lo's long shots, Tai Fuk-sing and Li Pui-chek's repeated stealing to the basket, contributed a lot. Poon Yiu-kwan and Sun Nga-long were tightly marked and unable to use their skills. Li Pui-yim, originally a capable member of Star Island, only played for a short time in yesterday's battle, which is very puzzling. The team's coordination was better than South China's. The passing method was especially commendable, and the jumping ball under the basket was also better. Therefore, their defeat was not due to inferior skills, but because their desire to win was too strong, and they often failed to seize opportunities. For example, Tai Fuk-sing got a free throw in the last minute but failed to hit it, and was defeated by South China by one point.</p>
<p>During the match, Star Island's Tai Fuk-sing's long shot opened the scoring. Soon, South China tied the score at 4-4 and 8-8, and then took the lead at 12-8. Afterwards, the two sides each scored points, and the scores were tied at 12, 16, and 20. The first half ended. South China then took the lead again with 24-21. After switching sides, the two sides played as if in a seesaw, but South China was always in the lead. The scores were 30-25, 33-25, 35-26. In the last nine minutes, Star Island caught up and the score was 37-41 and 40-43. With two minutes left, the two sides tied at 43-43. South China then scored a free throw. Tai Fuk-sing also got a free throw, but unfortunately missed. By then, the clock on the wall had rung, and South China shouted triumphantly in jubilation.</p>

<p>…(Our Newspaper Special) Wang Wenzheng, a tennis ace from our country, has been highly praised for several years while residing in Shanghai, and has represented Sichuan at the last National Games held in Nanjing, so many people in the country have heard of him.</p>
<p>…Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Wang has returned to Chongqing and is working in a certain institution. In his spare time, he invites one or two friends to play tennis, so his skills have been maintained at the level he was at in Shanghai.</p>

After arriving in Hong Kong, he will hold several exhibition matches.</p>
<p>…The Hong Kong tennis community is currently very active. After the open grass court singles and doubles competitions, the open team competition is coming up. If Wang arrives in Hong Kong at this time, he can be invited to take part at the right time. Tennis fans will also have a good time.</p>
<p>…Also, the Philippines-Taiwan Cup players, San Zato and Amber, are taking the President Beas liner to the United States.

<h3 id="e64">Discussion on Handling War Losses ××× <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shanchi</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the occupied areas have been reduced to ruins, and most industrial and commercial enterprises have been affected. Although the extent of damage varies, it is essential to seek relief and plan for the aftermath. Mr. Xi Yushu, a local accountant, previously drafted an opinion on this matter and submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review. Recently, a reply was received, and Mr. Xi has added supplementary measures and made them public. For a time, industrial and commercial enterprises, recognizing the significant impact on their own interests, have paid close attention and actively discussed it. The author believes that the handling of war losses should have specific measures to follow. However, the content of these measures should be carefully considered to ensure comprehensiveness. Otherwise, inappropriate measures will have a negative impact on the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, I venture to offer some humble opinions for discussion.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of Mr. Xi's proposal and the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approved measures is "treating war losses as deferred assets and offsetting them with annual profits." We believe that this measure is somewhat simplistic and may be difficult to implement uniformly. At the same time, treating war losses as deferred assets and specifying that they must be offset by annual profits also feels somewhat ambiguous in its wording. The term "deferred assets" is a technical term in accounting. According to accounting methods, the amortization of deferred assets must be carried out during the final settlement. In other words, the amortization amount of deferred assets must first be listed as expenses before calculating net profit, rather than calculating net profit first and then engaging in amortization. Therefore, if war losses are handled as deferred assets, their allocation and offsetting cannot be done from annual profits. However, if the amortization and offsetting should indeed be done from profits, then war losses cannot be treated as deferred assets. Thus, according to the original wording, it is not clear how war losses should be handled. Judging from the restrictions on the amortization period shown later, it seems to indicate that the amortization and offsetting should be done before the final settlement. Otherwise, the calculation of income tax is originally based on net profit. If there is profit, tax should be paid. Why bother considering its amortization period? Below, please first discuss whether war losses can be treated as deferred assets.</p>
<p>(1) In accounting, the term "deferred assets" comes from the English "Deferred Assets." The definition of "Deferred" originally means delay or extension. In accounting, for some prepaid expenses, because their benefits may extend to the following year, and at the same time, this loss should not be borne by the current year in fact, so it is temporarily treated as assets. One is to allow its benefits to extend to the following year, and the other is to transfer the expenses that the current year should not bear to the following year. Its meaning is profound, and its method is excellent. Therefore, for expenditures such as prepaid rent and prepaid insurance, accounting has almost confirmed their nature as deferred assets. However, for opening expenses, doubts inevitably arise about the extension of their benefits and whether they should be transferred to the following year. Therefore, scholars still cannot unanimously confirm it as a type of deferred asset. Now, war losses occur completely unexpectedly, and after they occur, there are no benefits that can be extended to the following year, nor is there any reason to argue that they must be shared by future years. It is a confirmed loss and cannot be compared with prepaid expenses. This is very obvious. This is one point that accounting theory considers questionable.</p>
<p>(2) Any enterprise, if it wants to develop soundly, must make capital enrichment its only goal. The way to enrich capital is to have a large amount of public reserves on the active side and no floating assets on the passive side. The company law stipulates that surplus must be used to deposit public reserves when distributing surplus, strictly supervises the investment of assets other than money, prohibits the discount issuance of share capital, and the common practice of merchants and income tax laws encourage low prices for asset valuation, all in order to make the capital of enterprises tend to be enriched. Now, in terms of war losses, the original assets have obviously been lost, and the capital has obviously been damaged. However, if it is still allowed to be retained as an asset on the books, it is obviously contrary to the principle of capital enrichment. I am afraid that the result may not be able to alleviate the current difficulties, but it will be greatly harmful to the attempt to regenerate in the future. This is the second point that business financial management considers questionable.</p>
<p>(3) Any enterprise, if it has a surplus at the end of the year, in addition to compensating for losses and depositing legal public reserves, shareholders can request the distribution of dividends. Now, for enterprises that have suffered losses due to war, if the losses are listed as carried-forward losses, then before the full amount is compensated, even if there is a surplus, shareholders are not allowed to request the distribution of dividends according to law. However, if they are listed as deferred assets, it will inevitably allow those who are originally in loss to still be settled as surplus, and those who should have a smaller surplus will be able to settle more surplus. Therefore, shareholders can request the distribution of a large amount of dividends (because it has been admitted that losses can be treated as assets before, it cannot restrict shareholders from requesting the distribution of dividends later). However, this surplus is originally false. If it is allowed to be distributed, it will inevitably evolve into a phenomenon of using capital as interest, which is still a taboo even in peacetime, let alone after the war when the foundation of the enterprise has already been weakened. Therefore, the result of treating war losses as deferred assets is simply using accounting techniques to openly violate the legal provision that "no dividends can be distributed without profit." This is the third point that legal considerations consider questionable. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Report from our Correspondent] Li Shuoyou, the left winger of the South China football team, was red carded by referee Ye Jiu for a foul during a special Silver Shield match between the team and the Eastern Association team in early of this year. Subsequently, the executive committee of the Football Association decided to impose a heavy penalty, suspending his eligibility to play until the end of this year. Now, the authorities of the South China Association Football Department believe that although Li's foul on that day was inappropriate, the suspension for as long as one year seems excessive. Therefore, they recently sent a letter to the General Association, requesting that Li's suspension period be shortened so that he can return to play on the day the next football season begins. It is heard that the General Association will hold a meeting during the day to discuss this request.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Sneaking into Wuhu City <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ping</p>
<p>Snippets of a city occupied by × people</p>
<p>When you meet × people, you have to salute, but you can't put your feet together and stick your hands to your sides. If you're too proper, they'll say you're a Chinese soldier. You should deliberately act like a country bumpkin doing a bow. This way, the enemy soldiers might even pat you on the shoulder and say, "Good citizen, good citizen," and let you pass. At some places, the enemy sentries will let you pass if you give them three or four eggs!</p>
<p>Inside the city, the searches by the × people are quite strict, but it doesn't matter, there are real good citizens to cover you. At the same time, when you enter the city, you have to prepare beforehand, either pretending to be a merchant or a farmer. If you can speak Anhui dialect, that's even better. After the × soldiers check your whereabouts, they will definitely ask, "Are there any Chinese soldiers?" "Are there any New Fourth Army soldiers?" You shake your head and wave your hands and say, "I don't know, we don't have any where we live," or deliberately say, "Lots and lots," These nonsensical words are sometimes said by the innkeepers (or shopkeepers). They are country bumpkins, what do they know, and then you can pass. In short, as long as you deal with it properly and don't cause trouble, it doesn't matter if they catch you, especially now that × is adopting a "appeasement policy." How can they burn and kill on such a large scale like in the past when they talk about so much benevolence, righteousness, and morality? Therefore, according to the × people's own estimates, there are more than two thousand "plainclothes detectives" active in our city of Wuhu, making them uneasy day and night. The Nanjing Secret Service also set up a "Wuhu class" here, on the one hand training traitors, and on the other hand dealing with our "plainclothes detectives."</p>
<p>The most prosperous street in Wuhu is still Zhongshan Road Changjie, but so-called "prosperity" really just means that there are more people. There are no large stores, except for some foreign firms and associations opened by × people. At most, there are small stalls set up by refugees, selling Japanese goods for the × people and barely making a living under the heavy military taxes and exploitation. However, business is also extremely slow. In addition, what is really thriving is prostitution and gambling. Almost all the large hotels, such as "Dahua" and "Zhongnan," are gambling dens and brothels. There are even publicly advertised brothels in the traitor newspapers, soliciting customers, and there are even Japanese prostitutes' houses. These prostitutes who have been reduced to inhuman status must not only provide their bodies to "comfort" the "Imperial Army," but also hand over the blood and sweat they have earned from selling their flesh to the "Imperial Army" every day! The lowest official "flower tax" is two yuan, and there are other miscellaneous taxes, such as inspection fees. At the same time, the "Imperial Army" is even more thoughtful and wants them to "receive training" to learn more captivating skills so that they can use their charms to gather intelligence and become spies for the "Imperial Army"!</p>
<p>In addition to training prostitutes as detectives, they also pull monks and nuns out of the "Buddhist gate" and into the "mortal world" to take the scarce bloody money and act as accomplices for the nemesis of the Bodhisattva—the Japanese ××—reaching all beings. It's really "sinful, sinful," the schemes of the × people can be said to be unscrupulous!</p>
<p>The pseudo-county magistrate of Wuhu used to be Zhu Yu's subordinate. Because he wagged his tail so diligently, he has now been promoted to provincial commissioner. It is said that the × people recently appointed him as the pseudo-governor of "Jiangnan Province"—renaming Jingwu as "Jiangnan Province." The current county magistrate of Wuhu is Wang Yizidong, a "former Qing scholar." Every time he goes out, he must have a large number of Japanese military police "protecting" him. The same is true in the "county government" and the "official residence." In fact, they are monitoring him. Therefore, in addition to being afraid of the Chinese troops, they are even more afraid of their own masters. Being a traitor is really bitter!</p>
<p>In order to "prosper" the market and pretend to be peaceful, the × people have restored, renamed, or rebuilt several theaters. The Fuguang and Guangming theaters show movies, and the films are numbing goods such as "King of Ten Thousand Years" and "Heroes and Heroines." The Huayuan Grand Stage and the Fuxing Grand Stage are dedicated to performing operas. The entrances of the theaters and the advertisements in the pseudo-newspapers are all prominently written with words such as "Imperial Army Half Price," "Preferential Treatment for the Imperial Army," or "Welcome the Imperial Army to Be Seated."</p>
<p>There are several streets where pedestrians are absolutely prohibited, and that is where the × people's barracks and wounded soldiers' hospitals are located. Their wounded soldiers cannot run around casually. First, they are afraid of disturbing the market. Second, they are afraid that the enemy soldiers will see the injuries. Third, they are afraid that we will find out the exact number of his wounded soldiers and estimate his troop strength. These places can be said to be the enemy's weaknesses!</p>
<p>Speaking of wounded soldiers, I am reminded of the screams from the Wuhu granary at 10 pm on the 12th of April. That day, as soon as it got dark, the enemy imposed martial law, prohibiting any pedestrians from passing. The common people knew that something important must have happened again. Before long, several wounded Japanese soldiers who had just been defeated at Jiulishan and were eating in a small tavern were pulled up by several Japanese military police and left. The wounded soldiers asked them to let them "misi misi" (eat) before leaving. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Shi Dakai's Poems <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>There are very few poems by Shi Dakai in the collections compiled by Lao He and Lu Jiye in their "Poems and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," which makes readers feel inadequate. There is also the "Diary of Shi Dakai" re-edited by Xu Zhizhi. According to the preface, Xu Zhiyan once "polished the words," so whether this diary is real or how much it has been polished becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Shi Dakai probably wrote many poems, but we can only see thirty of them now. The "Complete Works of Shi Dakai" has four more poems than the "Poems and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," namely "To Mr. Shi Longgan of Xiangxiang."</p>
<p>The two poems of emotion in Shi Dakai's diary are recorded in all books. In addition, there are many mentions of writing poems, but unfortunately Shi Dakai did not attach the original poems. For example, it says:</p>
<p>"On the first day of the fourth month, I wrote several more poems, thinking that Wei's control over the north was like an iceberg. Within a month, they would fight each other. Heaven's way is just, so why should people do evil!"</p>
<p>"On the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month, I watched the moon and wrote pine ballads at night, and the fourth girl harmonized them." (At the time in Jingzhou)</p>
<p>"On the first day of the fifth month, my daughter, the fourth girl, married Ma Shuji Delian, and I wrote a small poem to commemorate it, with the line 'Since there is love, they become a family, how dare I say the colorful phoenix goes to follow the crow,' which is a factual record."</p>
<p>"On the twenty-eighth day of the fifth month, I was overwhelmed with old sorrows and emotions, so I composed several poems, which were taken away hand-in-hand. The fourth girl kept them for me. I don't know who will take them and cover the jar with them one day." Presumably "Chaos within chaos" and "Our dynasty is wounded by internal strife" were both written at this time.</p>
<p>"On the fifteenth day of the ninth month, I arrived in Yanping and passed the former residence of Zheng Chenggong, and wrote a poem on the wall before leaving."</p>
<p>"On the sixth day of the fourth month, I visited Taoyuan and listened back in the evening, composing several yin poems."</p>
<p>"On the fifth day of the fifth month, the fourth girl gave birth to a daughter, and I now have a granddaughter, and I wrote a poem to show Ma Sheng."</p>
<p>If the diary is not fabricated, then, as recorded above, at least a dozen poems have been lost.</p>
<p>However, even among the existing thirty poems, some are unreliable. According to Liu Yazi, some of the lost ones were forged by his deceased friend Gao Tianyu in order to promote revolution.</p>
<p>Among the existing poems, whether in content or form, there are quite a few that are close to Cao Zhi. Shi Dakai was also alienated by Hong Xiuquan and resented by Na Changhui, so he escaped. As he says, "Quietly thinking, I sigh three times, and tears wet my sleeves." "Our dynasty is wounded by internal strife, alas, my heart is sad... What else can I say, where will I go?" "Time suddenly does not pass, the sun sets in the Central Plains, flesh and blood are scattered, and bones are exposed on the road." "The great river lacks boats, how can I cross the stream? Alas, there are no boats, I look northwest at the floating clouds." "We have been together for a long time, and we are about to say goodbye: ... Ambition stretches for thousands of miles, and his voice shakes in all directions." All of the above are very similar to Cao Siwang. The chaotic times, his own experiences, are all the same, no wonder even the poems are similar.</p>
<p>Although I know that some of Shi Dakai's poems are fake, and his so-called writing poems in his diary is even more unreliable, I always delusionally hope that they are all real. Maybe I like Shi Dakai too much.</p>
<h3 id="e69">About Literary and Art Workers <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xueming</p>
<p>The storm of national revolution that was the "August 13th" Incident shook everything in China. The old was discarded, and the new is growing in blood. As a reflection of the spirit of the times, literature and art must also have its own special progress.</p>
<p>First of all, it should be pointed out that the unprecedented national crisis has prompted the unity of writers, which has its historical roots. China's new literature and art have always been inseparable from the national liberation movement, especially at this stage. In order to complete the task of resisting Japan and promoting democracy in literature, regardless of their colors or factions (traitors and Trotskyites are of course exceptions), they should embark on a very frank and sincere path of mutual respect, exploration, and cooperation!</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the development of the anti-Japanese war, the lifestyles of writers have undergone tremendous changes. Most of them have gone to the front line or to the guerrilla areas to fulfill their missions, finding truth in the battlefield life, and their circle of life is even broader.</p>
<p>This great war of resistance is a cause of the masses, and everything must be based on them as the main force. In this way, literature and art must bear the mission of mobilizing them. Therefore, using old forms to establish the literature and art of the masses has become the most urgent thing for writers.</p>
<p>In order to meet the objective needs, small works such as sketches, newsletters, and reports have replaced cumbersome long works. This new function is to grasp the fragments of the drastically changing reality and express them powerfully. The recently launched literary and artistic communication movement is even more emphasizing this feature.</p>
<p>These facts all prove the progress of the literary and artistic circles since the Anti-Japanese War. However, due to the insufficient main strength of some writers, there are also many weaknesses that have been exposed.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy thing is the issue of the utilization of old forms by some writers. Due to too much accommodation and abuse of them, they have not yet fully obtained its clear, bright, and mass-friendly means of expression. There has been an extremely disharmonious phenomenon between the old forms and the new content, and even feudal superstitious vocabularies and expressive techniques are still being adopted.</p>
<p>The one-sidedness of the subject matter has led anti-Japanese literature and art to fall into a formulaic path. Most articles only write about the bravery of the soldiers on the front line, while ignoring the characters of various classes in the rear. The changing thoughts, lifestyles, or other forms that accompany the Anti-Japanese War can all be used as subjects for description. There are also some writers who often have the problem of self-embodiment in the expression of characters in his works. For example, the masses who are illiterate can actually say many jargons that do not fit their tone. The masses are naturally isolated from these. As a result, the paper becomes the so-called "donkey literature" that is neither fish nor fowl!</p>
<p>Now that the Anti-Japanese War has developed to the second stage, our literary and artistic workers should give full play to their abilities, review the past, coordinate with the objective situation, and fulfill the responsibility of their pens. Here are what we should pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Be cautious about the utilization of forms, especially for the adoption of local folk songs, new content should be instilled.</p>
<p>(2) The themes should be deepened and expanded to all classes, avoiding "formulaic" styles.</p>
<p>(3) Fully utilize the language of the masses to overcome the shortcomings of being separated from the masses.</p>
<p>(4) The artistic truthfulness must be unified with the popularization of the content.</p>
<p>The literature and art of the Anti-Japanese War is progressing with the times, and has a new enlightenment meaning. We must grasp this key point.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Destruction and Rebirth <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Vanishing in smoke and fire, desperate groans, painful weeping, laughter turning to tears, bustling cities turning to desolate ruins, familiar faces becoming names of remembrance, reunited families turning into new ghosts.</p>
<p>Buried by demonic hands: humanity's vows, clues to happiness, peaceful air, prosperous life, mountains of morality, wings of freedom.</p>
<p>Inserting thorns one by one, piercing the dreams of your clothes. The beauty of past maturity is not fantasy or madness. Dreams, one by one, plump and full fruits, are pierced, fall to the ground, wither, are destroyed, and buried in the earth.</p>
<p>Unable to endure the pricking thorns, nor willing to succumb to destruction, the buried fruit, due to rain, sunlight, and soil, will eventually sprout, bud, blossom, and bear fruit.</p>
<p>——Destroyed, it will be reborn.</p>
<p>As long as a breath remains, the potential of life, neither silent nor willing to perish, everything can be reborn. Sprouts wither, but can re-emerge; failures occur, but can be retold; flowers fall, but can re-bloom; fruits break, but can re-form. The thorns of destruction pierce clothing, but only increase the anger in your heart. Anger is like kerosene, poured on the fire of life, making people more vital. Squeeze closer, you can push further; oppress harder, you can resist more; enrage more, you can be braver; destroy more, you can be reborn more.</p>
<p>Thank those heart-pricking thorns, which destroy all you have, making you cherish, pity, resent, and curse. Without these, you would not seek revenge. Without the push of anger, you would not be so powerful. Without forced destruction, you would not dismantle on your own.</p>
<p>You are destroyed, you are pushed, and you are stung. Those who cherish old things must create new things; those who pity the destroyed must give them comfort; those who resent the perpetrators must give them revenge; those who curse the wicked must give them retribution.</p>
<p>No need to offer condolences in the desolate ruins, searching for the past glory among the broken tiles, painting the slanting sun on the crumbling walls, and then you look at it and become speechless. You might as well be generous and heroic, smiling at your enemies while sharpening your swords. Thank destruction, destroying one fruit, which can produce two, three, or even hundreds. In the future, you can see magnificent buildings rising from scorched earth, a new generation more sound and powerful than their ancestors. Rottenness destroyed can produce soundness; the ancient destroyed can produce freshness; sediment destroyed can produce purity.</p>
<p>Destruction makes us angry, but it also makes us stronger. I am not afraid of destruction, only afraid of no rebirth.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Snow of Manchuria <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"I still hope you will work with us forever in the future."</p>
<p>Smiled. Satisfied.</p>
<p>As she was about to leave, he suddenly erupted with a sense of farewell. He was reluctant to let her leave his side—after leaving, seeing her again would be distant. A short acquaintance, who knows when they would meet again? Although he believed she could become a comrade, who could guarantee that imagination could become reality? In this strange encounter, once he parted with her, if they went their separate ways in life, how would his unforgettable memories stir his heart? So, he asked his comrade to leave first, to move away; he escorted her home. He wished to use this final farewell to comfort the unease in his heart, both present and future, caused by his thoughts of her.</p>
<p>She was silently accompanied, walking along the same doorway, room door, and courtyard path she had walked before. She kept looking around, realizing that the departure was different from the arrival: the arrival was deep in the night two days ago, and she had felt resentment; the departure was shortly after this morning, and she felt that everything was worth cherishing. But the arrival was the same as the departure, and neither the arrival nor the departure was voluntary. It was as if it were a dream, in which he lingered for almost three days. These three days felt like a year, and yet also felt as fast as a moment.</p>
<p>The two of them walked side by side, already good friends. In their parting, the time was short; the words of farewell were endlessly long. The escort and the escorted were both unwilling to take long strides, both afraid of the road shortening, both hoping to extend the time by a moment, so that each could offer a few more words of farewell. That's how the two of them were; this departure was similar to her arrival, but completely opposite to his arrival.</p>
<p>Suddenly, on the road, she stopped; but this was not the same kind of stop as on her arrival. After thinking for a moment, she said:</p>
<p>"Did I forget something at your place?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so, did you?" (Six Seven)</p>
