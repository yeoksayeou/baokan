<h3 id="c1">推行國民精神總動員　上海市的反漢奸運動 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>新聞界　聲討漢奸宣言</p>
<p>（上海特約通訊）二十一日爲本市精神總動員文化界宣傳日，本市新聞界從業員，特發表共同宣言，痛斥漢奸謬論妄舉，號召全體市民，堵絕汪精衛及其黨羽一切活動之路，茲錄其宣言全文于后：</p>
<p>在民族抗戰已進入第二期的今日，日本帝國主義已自知其武力併吞中國的夢想，無法做成，因此特側重於漢奸活動，一方面企圖分製中國的抗戰陣容，一方面掩飾其新進攻，期求鬆懈中國的警戒。　　　　　　　中，特別是汪精衛及其羽黨的　　活動，以『和平』『直接交涉』的姿態出現，散播民族失敗情緒，來得狠毒。汪逆的『和平』主張，響應近衛東亞新秩序的烟幕，雖然他自己很可以自圓其說，其實是澈頭澈尾的亡國條件，誠如蔣委員長所說：『如其這樣算是和平，字典上也沒有投降的降字了！』本日爲國民精神總動員宣傳週文化界宣傳日，我們特鄭重宣告：我們決竭其全力反對侵略者及漢奸的活動，我們對于侵略者及汪　羽黨一切　　的活動，　　　　　　　！我們要求全體市民，一致起來反對汪逆及一切漢奸的鬼蜮行動，堵絕汪黨及一切漢奸任何活動的道路。</p>
<p>上海本報社評　「展開反汪運動」</p>
<p>又本月廿二日上海申報社評，題爲『展開反汪運動』原文云：在全國精神總動員推行的今日，應該立刻展開一個反汪運動，　　　　　　　，只有反汪才是全中國意志集中現階段最具體的表現。</p>
<p>要認識反汪運動的必要，就得先淸除一切對汪兆銘　　行動的恕辭。有些人以爲汪兆銘的荒謬行爲，無非起於一時的觀察錯誤，至於他的動機總還是可諒的。其實汪兆銘的　　　　，事前早有預定計劃，所以屢次發表怪誕言論，最後竟不恤與近衛合串雙簧，做日閥的內應；等到二　昭著以後，又沒有絲毫悔禍的表示，反而變本加厲，僞造文件，播弄是非，嗾使黨羽，進行　　組織，這種有計劃有步驟的行動，還可以算是一時的觀察錯誤嗎？另有些人珍惜汪兆銘過去的政治生命，認爲目前他雖　　　　　，但不妨處之以恕道。其實對一個人寬恕，無非希望他能够悔悟；汪兆銘旣然不會悔悟，寬恕他何用？况且一個人的善惡，全看最後的表現，汪兆銘的軀體雖尙未到蓋棺的時期，但是精神上已經結束了他的一生，他已經自我表現爲一個　　　　　　　，卽使過去有一二小善，也何能掩蓋其最後的　　？何况汪兆銘一生歷史全是投機。爲了發揮他的領袖慾起見，慣作朝三暮四覆雨翻雲的勾當，根本連小善小信也找不到，我們可以珍惜他什麼呢？更有一些人以爲汪兆銘除幾個爪牙以外，沒有羣衆，他的言論只是個人的行動，根本不會發生什麽作用的，不妨聽他自己幻滅，何必這樣重視呢？其實汪兆銘誠然沒有羣衆，誠然不足重視：可是他現在已經是日閥的工具，他的主子已從那可憐荷包裏掬出了一部份錢替他張揚，替他拉攏羣醜，有所重大企圖，同時他的爪牙又大肆活動，正打算從印刷物或敎育界裏施展鬼蜮技倆，遂其蠱惑人心的陰謀，倘使不加防止，聽其滋長，這是抗戰過程中所不能容許的。</p>
<p>我們只消一讀吳稚啄氏白話文學責汪兆銘的文字，便知道他如何處心積慮地出　　　　　，如何做了日閥的內應，自毀其政治生命，更如何不知悔禍，繼續進行他的陰謀。所以每一個中國人都應該知道汪兆銘是無可宥恕的　，寬恕奸徒就是一種罪惡。</p>
<p>自從汪兆銘對他的『友邦』獻了一個　亡中國計劃以後，日本已於三月上旬起開始在江西等處舉行新進攻；可是中國政府除了再三申明堅决抗戰的立場以外，再在日方氣衰力竭的時候，舉行反攻，而且節節勝利，這不啻粉碎了日閥與汪兆銘的聯合陰謀。然而這還是不够的，中國國民應該把普遍的反注運動來配合政府的行動，使汪兆銘的陰謀，不但一時粉碎，而且永遠不再發生。</p>
<p>反汪運動的內容應該是肅淸一切的　　理論，第一，抗戰是國策，抗戰勝利是必然的結果，二十一個月來的事實已證明了中國根本未敗，日本却已着着走上了潰敗的道路，因此根本上無所誚『兩敗俱傷，』在未達到勝利的目的以前根本無和平可言，如果妄談和平，那就是漢奸。第二，中國的統一戰綫是根據事實的需要而建立的，目前正在成長，正在充實，無絲毫破裂的徵象，卽使將來抗戰結束以後，中國還要在統一戰綫的陣營裏建設嶄新的三民主義共和國，也沒有絲毫破裂的可能。那替中國前途作無謂杞憂的言論的，也就是漢好。在反汪運動中，人人應該負有檢舉　　理論加以糾正的責任。</p>
<p>反汪運動應該是普遍的，有組織的；應該與精神總動員相配合，作爲精神總動員實施要項之一。至於在上海，應該由敎育界來領導這反汪運動，並且敎育界自身先舉行澈底的思想上的肅反運動，因爲反汪運動的性質是意識上的爭取眞理，由敎育界來領導最爲適宜，而且又盛傳汪系爪牙正企圖向上海敎育界施展陰謀，行使思想毒菌的注射。</p>
<p>反汪運動應該盡量地擴充到游擊區裏去。因爲在日僞控制的區域中，中國同胞受着知識的封鎖，不容易瞭解到目前中國的局勢；同時日僞又積極地施行麻醉和奴化的精神訓練，在僞報紙上把汪兆銘捧作救世的眞主，蒙蔽中國的同胞。因此反汪運動應該滲入淪陷地域，用一切可能的方法揭穿日僞捧汪的用意，宣揚抗戰的眞諦，除解苦難同胞精神上的錮蔽。</p>
<p>青年界　擴大統一戰綫</p>
<p>二十日爲國民精神總動員敎育界宣傳日，全市各學校除舉行國民精神總動員綱領之大單元敎學，各報出版特刊外，並由敎界國民精神總動員協會發表吿全市靑年書，茲摘錄如次：</p>
<p>靑年是時代的驕子，有質樸的心性，聰敏的腦筋，活潑的精神，强健的體魂，和光榮革命歷史，在中國，無論是政治，文化，以及科學，沒有一事不是由靑年來提倡，來推動，來變革，而至於逐漸達到目的，五四運動時，我國靑年對於政治文化的啓蒙，固然立下了燦爛的功績，卽黄花崗七十二烈士中，所犧牲的大多數是靑年，其後五卅運動，九一八和一二八事變，無一次沒有靑年學生，在救國大潮流中，呼號活躍，華北局勢緊張中，以迄蘆溝橋抗戰砲聲響澈後，靑年的動態，尤其値得令人興奮鼓舞，從前方以及後方，從正規戰以及游擊戰，差不多有數十萬的靑年餐風沐雨，忍飢耐寒，奔馳苦幹，犧牲救國，在民族革命史上，的確是値得大書特書的，可是我們孤島上的靑年怎樣呢，勤勞刻苦爲國奮鬥的，固然有，但百分之八十以上的靑年，仍舊度其醉生夢死的生活，保其苟且偷生的習性，暮氣充溢，不求知也不求行，舉凡奮發蓬勃的朝氣，勇敢前進的决心，節約廉介的風尙，忠義知恥的道德，在孤島上已如晨星之寥落，孤島雖有百餘萬靑年，其實大多數都是坐等亡國，或是坐等勝利之降臨，而甘心放棄大革命時期救國建國的神聖使命，縱或淸夜捫心，不能恐怕後世，也必然要加以唾罵也—現在我們希望於全市靑年的，有下列數點。，</p>
<p>集體奮鬥</p>
<p>社會越進化，則人們的工作，越趨集團，也只有集體工作，纔能產生鉅大的力量，救國建國，尤其非使全國民衆，都有組織，都能在集團中動員不可，國民精神總動員，就是要以這種集團的精神和力量，來幫助軍隊抗敵，幫助政府建國，使最後勝利，復興民族，迅速完成，所以青年們非但要自已放棄個人主義的活動踴躍地參加這個集團，同時，還要自動地組織這個集團，或宣傳並推動他人來參加這個集團。</p>
<p>信仰統一</p>
<p>中國抗戰不是僅做到獲得國家的獨立自由為止，乃是要使民族主義民權主義民生主義，都能同時並進，具體實行。我們既是要建設一個自由幸福的三民主義新中國，那末，必然要共同信仰三民主義，研究三民主義，宣傳三民主義，爲三民主義而奮鬥救國。並且有了共同信仰之後，就一定能夠由共信而互信，使民挨統一戰綫，團結得如塞門汀一樣的堅强，以此除×，何×不摧，以此建國，何患不達目的。</p>
<p>意志集中</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，有了共同信仰以後，還要有共同的意志，不紛岐，不錯亂，向着共同目標前進，使　人由削弱而動搖，由動搖而崩潰，何謂共同目標，就是無論何種工作，也是無論何種事業，都要不彈煩勞，精細設計，使有助於抗戰，有益於國家民族，換言之，就是時時刻刻，要把國家至上，民族至上，國事第一，勝利第一』，放在心上，作爲一切工作事業的前途。</p>
<p>生活改革</p>
<p>除上述以外，個人的習性與生活，也和抗戰建國，有莫大的影響，經濟上和時間上的浪費，固然會削弱抗戰的經濟，延遲勝利的時間就是委靡不振，苟且偷安，庸懦浪漫，也足以亡國而有餘，何况前方戰士，正爲民族犧牲，無數同胞，也爲國家受苦，我們獨何心而享樂，至於在校求學之靑年，尤其應該刻苦精勤，朝氣奮發，做一般靑年的模範，爲抗戰而工作，爲建國而求知，從令日起，我們要求共同負起救國建國的責任，使經濟和時間，都能向着革命的大路前進。</p>
<p>文化界　宣言擁護抗戰</p>
<p>廿一日爲文化界宣傳日，全市各報館各雜誌一致動員，準備完成本位上的使命，茲將宣言書一通，照錄如下：今天是國民精神總重員文化界宣傳日，我們文化界同人，是國民一份子，自應踴躍地參加精神總動員運動，敬謹地宣誓遵守國民公約，以全力實踐中央所頒發的國民精神總動員綱領，文化本來是國家與民族的精神產業，文化界所做的事業，也就是國家與民族的精神事業，因此，我們文化界同人所負推動國民精神總動員的責任，特別重大，茲就同人管見所及，分別來講：戰爭的三大要素，是人力財力。和軍力，這是一般人所公認的，人力是這三大要素之統整和領導的力量，而精神是一切人力的原動力，具體地說，精神是人類行爲之綜合的。統整的。創造的。和發動的力量，所謂精神動員，就是集中我們之綜合的。統整的。創造的。和發動的力量，向着國家至上。民族至上。軍事第一，勝利第一·和意志集中·力量集中·的三個共同目標來努力，以完成抗戰建國的神聖任務首先我們要明瞭抗戰建國的必要性，我們不能否認過去的二百多年以來，我們的民族確是萎靡不振，以往我們屢受異族的侵略，割地賠欵，喪失主權，差不多已經是國不成國了，然而我們還苟且偷安，不勵精圖治，以致×人乘虛而入，蹂躪我們國土，自東亞睡獅在蘆溝橋怒吼以來，經過二十一個多月的抗戰經騐，我們深知祗有抗戰，才可以維護中華民族的獨立。自由。和平等，祗有建國，才可以鞏固締造艱難的中華民國的基礎，同時，國際事變，也已經充分地證明不抵抗侵略，便立遭亡國的　禍，與略侵國妥協，等如與虎謀皮，勢必自受其害，這樣看來，我們應該繼續抗戰建國，是毫無疑義的了，我們的問題，是怎樣集中全國的人力財力和物力，具破釜沉舟的决心，努力奮鬥，以達到最後的勝利。抗戰建國的任務，本來是每個國民的天職，我們文化界同人一向被同胞推崇爲國民的優秀份子，所負抗戰建國的責任，自然是更加重大當國民精神總動員發動之時，我們應矢志立誓，遵守國民公約，並應檢査自己的生活。使一切行爲，都能够符合國民精神總動員綱領及其實施辦法，我們都是文化事業的工作人員，也就是精神事業的推動者，我們的腦是我們的行爲的發施號令的機構力我們的口和筆，是我們的利器，我們的四肢，是我們上馬殺敵，下馬作露佈的工具，自今以後，我們謹以整個的生命，默給國家與民族，至實施辦法，我們另有規定，恕不贅，謹此宣言。</p>
<p>職業界　號召擴大反汪</p>
<p>廿一日爲國民精神總動員宣傳週文化界宣傳日，除發表宣言外，各報並出版特刊，新聞界方面，並發表聲討漢奸宣言，號召市民，堵絕汪系　　之蠢動。廿二日爲職業界宣傳日，本市職業界國民精神總動員協會特發表成立宣言一通，各報並出版特刊，茲照錄如次：我國的抗戰正轉入一個新的更艱苦的階段，在這個階段，誠如最高領袖蔣委員長所昭示『要擊退×人，要建國成功，一大半要靠發揮我們民族每一份子的精神力量，而且越到接近勝利時，我們的環境，，必然更艱難，更困苦，更危險，就更要動員我們民族的整個的精神力量，以求最後的成功』，所以我們在這個生死成敗的關頭，一定更要動員全民族的一切力量，來克服困難，戰勝×人，以爭取中華民族自由解放的最後勝利，三月十二日，中央頒布國民精神總動員網領和實施辦法，便是總動員全民族力量，打擊×人進攻的最有效武器，全國人民，已在政府興最高領袖領導之下，積極推行，上海市各界國民精神總動員協會總部，早於上月成立，我們職業界本部亦繼着各界於本日宣吿成立，在上海，國民精神總動員，是有它特殊的意義的，而職業界所担負的任務，也特別重大，上海是個政治經濟的中心。侵略者政治上的陰謀和經濟上的掠奪，特別厲害，漢奸的活動，異常猖獗，過去在　　等處爲根據地的汪　　　　　活動，最近漸移至上海來作大本營，傳播和平謠言，進行分化陰謀，並企圖收買文化界，工商界，若干腐敗分子，充當其定卒，在經濟上，×人發行偽幣，擾亂我金融基礎，統制工商實業，勒斃我民族工業，傾塞劣貨，以吸收我資金，這些都是×人爲着凖備最後扎，新的進攻的行動，因此，我職業界不僅要配合上海各界，來響應最高領袖國民精紳總動員的偉大號召，同時還要更切實的把它展開，堅决執行政府所付予我們的重大任務，但是爲着這一運動，表　貫澈，整个革新，我們主張職業界人士，職業界團體，根據各業具體情况及環境，以下列各點爲中心，將職業界不分上下，整個的總動員起來，（二）展開反汪反漢奸運動，提高政治上的警覺性，肅淸一切動搖妥協的思想，嚴密防止一切腐敗份子的行動，以撲滅汪　及其走卒們的　　活動，而堅强我們抗戰的陣綫。（二）堅持不與×僞合作，金融界不用僞鈔，不與×僞經濟上往來，實業界不售原料與×僞，不與×僞合辦企業，工商界不買賣日貨，反對×僞一切統制，務使×人無從　取我金錢，供其運用。（三）動員資金·機器·人才，內到地去，建設總後方，鞏固經濟壁壘。（四）革除惡習，取締投機，改正醉生夢死的生活，養成奮發蓬勃之朝氣，打破自私自利之企圖，取締不法營案發國難財及投機等行動。（五）參加集體生活，凡不參加商界國民精神總動員協會的職業界人士，均應參加本協會各業的支部組織，公司商店，由經理領導之，務使人人能自動的積極的參加集體生活。（六）實行節約献金，戒除不良嗜好，禁絕奢侈虛糜，减低生活水準，以節約下來的金錢，救濟難胞，獻給國家，鼓勵有資者毀家紓難，切實推行以精神或物質，貢獻於國家的各種運動。（七）集中力量，加緊勞資團結，一般職工，應努力本位上的生產工作，而資方亦應顧到戰時職工生活，與以相當的改善，綱領上說：『精神總動員之推行，雖發端於由上而下，然欲其效果之眞實不欺，尤必有賴於人人互相督促與勸勉，在家庭則家人兄弟互相申儆與鼓勵，在機關與團體，則各份子應共同砥　與切磋，在社會無論身份相侔者，應以同志同胞之關係相督促與規勉，卽對身份較尊者，遇有違反精神之思想言論與行動，亦宜本國家民族之立場，懇切規勸，促其改革，所以總動員，是自上而下同時也是自下而上的民主運動，必須要加緊勞資的團結，方能做到「意志集中，力量集中」而發揮集體的力量，我們認為如果能抓緊住上述各點配合著來做，精神總動員在職業界一定能大大的展開，我們將以此來和各界人士相互勉勵，相互競賽，最近抗戰局勢，我方日轉有利，勝利的曙光，已經透露了。但是我們不能忘記蔣委員長的昭示，「越接近勝利時，我們的環境，必然更艱難，更困苦，更危險，就是要動員我們民族的　個的精神力量，以求最後的成功」讓我們起這個重任來吧，把精神總動員展開，成爲廣泛而深入的羣衆運動，動員全民族的一切精神力量，完成抗戰建國的事業，實現民族獨立，民權自由，民生幸福的三民主義新中國，謹此宣言。</p>

<p>外交戰與宣傳戰是大戰爆發前的一種特徵，在軍事一緊一鬆之間參以外交戰與宣傳戰，更足促進大戰動機的成熟。可見歐局的緩和是一時的緩慢而不是根本的解决。在這幾天的歐洲政治舞台上，可以看到兩種的動向：其一，德意暫時停止軍事的進攻而代以拉攏東歐諸小國的努力，與英法爭歐洲的領導權，加强自己的力量，其二，德意兩國發動輿論竭力攻擊英美法蘇等民主集團國家，對民主集團國家的外交制裁予以側面的反擊。英法之締造反侵略陣綫及集中東歐諸小國，在過去數星期間雖曾獲得相當效果，但是最近德意之拉攏南斯拉夫及匈牙利，也已在進展中。南斯拉夫不但已與意大利會談，南對意大利的保證態度雖尙猶豫，雙方且未簽訂任何協定，但是德國却還在施展其引誘手段，南斯拉夫外長馬爾哥維區又將於二十六日赴柏林。意大利目前最大的努力是圖謀南斯拉夫與匈牙利兩國諒解，且聞匈牙利已表示歡迎。目前在東歐諸小國之間南斯拉夫的關係非常重要。所以德意極力對南斯拉夫施以威脅與利誘，必欲南斯拉夫就範一。意大利對南斯拉夫提出保證的條件是：倘若南斯拉夫能加入防共協定，改組軍隊聽德意兩國指揮，與意簽訂商務協定，則甸牙利將撤囘其對南斯拉夫的要求，德意並且保證不向南斯拉夫侵略。南斯拉夫對此提議，且已加以玫慮的接受。這種情勢之進展，當然於英法民主國家之一個極大的打擊。但在英法對東歐諸小國之保證未能切實而具體規定，同時英法蘇土希羅等大小國家反侵畧陣綫之締造又遲遲不進，英國且對德意開着談判之門的今日，東歐諸小國之有如此態度，也是勢所難免的，唯一有效的辦法，就是對英法諸小國的保證要切實，對於德意侵略國家狂暴的行動的制止，要更具體些。</p>
<p>最近德意侵略國家改其軍事行動爲外交鬥爭的原因，不外乎下列四端：第一，繼英法態度積極之後，美國提出和平計劃，表示反對德意的侵略：第二，英國積極拉攏蘇聯參加反侵略陣綫，而蘇聯所提辦法更爲具體與有效；第三，美蘇在遠東積極準備對德意的帮兇加以制裁，增强英法的力量；第四，德意尙無在反侵略國家積極包圍下發動戰爭的力量與决心。特別是前三種條件，在英法之努力上尤其重要。因此，英法要在外交戰上獲得勝利，必須促使前三種條件更具體而迅速地發展。羅斯福總統的和平提議已使德意的狂暴猶豫起來，現在美國已將太平洋艦隊召囘並在考慮如何制止侵略者，帮助反侵略國家。所以英法能更積極而誠意地促進這種趨勢，其在外交上的力量將更增大，其次，蘇聯對於英法已不再抱疑慮，並已積極提出擴大反侵略陣綫的建議。倘若英法能就蘇聯的提議加以誠意的考慮與接受，則歐洲反侵畧陣綫的力量增大，而英法外交自可以節節勝利。我們希望所傳英蘇協定及法蘇協定，能早日實現，英法蘇的軍事合作也及早具體化。此外如美蘇積極制止遠東侵畧者以增强英法的力量一層，也要視英法態度如何以爲斷。今日，不但蘇聯遠東軍之强化與完備，造成了日本的憂慮，最近美國太平洋艦隊之調囘，也已引起日本的恐慌。日本最近召集五相會議，卽在於攷慮這一問題。</p>
<p>國際情勢的發展日益於英法有利，但其發展的結果能否眞於英法有利，則尙需要英法的作法與努力來决定。</p>

<p>輪渡調查</p>
<p>【民革社澳門通訊】廣州失陷後、華南的航業受着重大的打擊，最近江門失陷，華南航業巳步入奄奄欲絕的境地。四邑與港澳間的交通，目前僅有三頃至澳門的交通可以保持。以前來往江省輪渡『民族』等多艘，死沉沉地浮於前山海上；從前往來中山省城的恒安渡，聽說巳在澳門充作知用中學的宿舍。現在能肩起運輸責任的只有下列幾艘：</p>
<p>（一）聯商——由三埠至前山轉駁澳門。</p>
<p>（二）聯商，利民——共同接駁，前者走三埠段，後者走澳門段，可泊澳門碼頭。</p>
<p>（三）和記，大安——共同接駁，前者走三埠段，後者走澳門段，前山至澳門段由小艇接駁。</p>
<p>（四）恒記，德記——共同接駁，前者走三埠段，後者走澳門段，前山至澳門段亦由小艇接駁。</p>
<p>（五）武陽——小電船，來往三埠沙尾，再由澳門接達澳門。</p>
<p>（六）大台北——興（五）同。</p>
<p>（七）大興業——與（五）同。</p>
<p>以上幾輪輪渡，可以說是目前維持三埠與澳門間交通運輸輪渡。</p>
<p>營業情況</p>
<p>因爲輪渡的減少與票價的增加，這些輪渡的利潤頗好。近來的搭客，由三埠往澳門，甚爲擁擠，從澳門囘三埠，搭客較少。至於票價方面，各輪渡，並不一致，大略如下：</p>
<p>聯商（直達）——大艙六元，餐樓八元。</p>
<p>大安，和記（接駁）大艙六元，餐樓十元。</p>
<p>聯商，利民（接駁）——由三埠出澳門時，大艙四元，餐樓六元；由澳門返三埠時，大贛三元，餐樓四元。</p>
<p>恒記，德記（接駁）——大艙六元，餐樓八元</p>
<p>武陽，大台山，大興業等電船——一律六元四角。</p>
<p>除直達三埠澳門的聯商渡外，其餘的都經過繁魚沙狹窄的小涌道，在那裏，要在夜間經兩個鐘頭的小艇接駁，是很够吃苦的，搭客最好能坐直達的那一艘（聯商渡）。</p>
<p>航程今昔</p>
<p>往昔水道暢通，由澳門至三埠。只須十一個鐘頭。而今因一部巳入于×人勢力範圍，又一部屬于我軍封釧線，不得不繞道經小涌而行。如往昔經睦洲口入竹洲，　門滘，過尖冲，直入燈籠山咀，轉猪姆咀而達前山澳門，今則過睦洲口後，須綫一弓形經備河轉全鐘港入尖冲：至尖冲後又不能經燈咀咀，而　　弧形往前山江門，最低限度亦須十五個　頭；倘若遇到水淺呢，時間就說不定了。</p>
<p>武裝自衛</p>
<p>跟著×人的侵擾，海盜也猖狂起來。近來，刼船的案件　見書出，因此，除幾艘小電船外，其餘的無不鄱有武裝保護着。平常發生劫案的多在下列兩處地方：（一）是　魚沙，因為這里河道非常陜迫，而又頗綿長，盜匪是最易行劫。（二）是虎坑口，因爲那里河道狹窄而又較爲偏僻。但現在各輪渡的武裝巳相當充實，可以有擊敗盜匪的能力，所以難然遭遇着匪盜，也沒有很大的危險。</p>
<p>值得注意</p>
<p>目前有兩個値得我們注意的問題：第一，防止×人再進入，倘若×艦衝破了封鎖綫，泊一兩×艦在銀洲湖附近，則這條唯一的交通孔道就要斷絕了。第二，航行至小涌中常常擱淺，爲便利，通計，應將此等小涌挖深。　（林玲）</p>

<p>【中央社重慶廿四日電】軍事委會近製發戰地（卽游擊區）宣傳綱要如下、</p>
<p>戰　　　　作之必要</p>
<p>在第二期抗戰、戰地政治宣傳工作、較前綫和後方都要重要、理由是、</p>
<p>（一）在被××「佔領』的廣大萬域上面、×人所能確實佔領的、不過是城市幾個據點而已、其餘大部分的國土、都在我們統制和控制之中、（本年二月份行政院戰地縣政情形統計指出（甲）在戰區蘇浙皖贛冀豫魯晉閩鄂湘等省九百四十一縣中、縣長不能行使職權者、僅五十五縣、（乙）縣區一部份被佔縣長、仍駐縣城行使職權者二十五縣、（丙）縣墟淪陷縣長遷鄕辦公者、二百四十五縣、（丁）縣長移駐隣縣但仍能行使職權者廿三縣）我們已經可以在這廣大的區域上面、建立了許多抗戰根據地、留了許多正規部隊、組織了許多游擊隊、其活動範圍、自六七縣至數十縣之多、所以部長指示、我黨政人員及革命幹部、凡屬×後地區者、皆應留駐×後、同時全國上下、皆應以×人後方爲我革命工作之重要意義、</p>
<p>（二）×人武力侵略的策略、原以軍事爲手段而達成其經濟掠奪的目的、又以政治爲手段、掩飾其武力侵略的事實、×人到處嗾使漢奸、成立傀儡組織、同時利用漢奸、創立各種强盜公司、藉開發產業之名、以實行其損奪之實、就是這種陰謀的具體表現、針對着×人這種陰謀、我們必須以軍事掩護政略的攻、以政治助成軍事的勝利、執行這種對策、需要戰地的政治宣傳工作、負祖更大的任務</p>
<p>（三）在二期抗戰的今日、××「速戰速决」的戰略、以至「速和速結」的政略、都吿失收、陷於進退維谷、欲罷不能的絕境、弄得兵力不敷分配、財政羅掘俱窮、不得不發長期戰爭」的　鳴、和「長期肆設」的口號所謂『長期建設』其實也、就是「長期戰爭」就是企圖利用我戰地的人力物力、來推進一步侵略中國的資本、據最近情報、×人加緊援助僞「新中國政府」之建設、（一）固守佔領區、積極整理佔領區的富源、最低限度亦須設法供給×派遣軍在華軍實之需要、（二）在佔領區域内廣事墾植、由其國内將國民移往耕種、（三電碼不明）我們要打擊×人這種迷夢、首先要做到使×人無從在戰地中掠奪資源、編練僞軍這一任務、大部分要落在戰地政工人員肩上、必須廣泛深入×後、發動游擊戰爭、鞏固各地革命政權、破壞×人之交通、阻撓×人政治經濟文化之一切設施、務使×人疲於奔命、爲我革命勢力所包圍打擊、以全於崩潰（陳部長語）、</p>
<p>（四）第二期抗戰的特點、卽於轉守爲攻、轉敗爲勝、他方面要阻止×人的進攻、一方面要準備更多的兵力、使他們無力而且不敢放胆進攻、同時在×後準備更有戰門經驗的部隊、團結更有抵抗力一量的民衆、以便在總反攻時、可用以夾擊×人、截斷×人歸路、</p>
<p>（五）戰地處在×人後、時時可以遭受×人的威脅攻擊、經常不易獲得我們後方的接濟、因此必須加緊政治宣傳工作、提高戰地部隊和民眾之民族意識、與犧牲精神、必須「無限的提高了政治工作的重要性」才能達成此神聖偉大的任務、</p>

<h3 id="c13">重慶避襲雜感 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 君邃</p>
<p>新疆紀行之三</p>
<p>我於三月十九日抵兪。重慶自從一月十五日被×機轟以來，尙未重來，重慶的當局雖高唱疏散人口，市民仍抱得過且過的態度，迄未作切實的疏散，我在第二次通訊中也巳提及。不料廿八日晚上九時十五分夜襲警報突然而來，那時我正應同事倪二君的宴會，在會仙橋粉江飯店吃飯。酒過三巡，正在進飯的時候，忽然樓上下步履聲紛起。主人詢知係空襲警報，主客均離席下樓，我詢主人此間以何處防空壕爲最近，可以同去暫避？坐在右邊的駱君卽携手下樓，詢知彼住在交通銀行，該行地下室頗堅固可避襲，當即離飯店向目的地前進。見沿途車輛塞途，秩序紊亂，人行道旁適建備水池，數丈之間，卽有一長方形窟窿，行路大感不便。我們神志甚淸，隨說隨行，約十數分鐘即到該行門首，由邊門而入。到了屋內，巳見婦孺紛集，都向地下室門口魚貫而入，我們也跟了進去。地下室本爲銀庫的隧道，兩面通風，寬約四五尺，置有長凳，我們就坐在凳上。待到九時四十五分鐘，接着發緊急警報，電燈立時息滅，閉目靜坐，思潮起落，事後囘想，頗有一記的價値。至十時五分警報解除，我們隨着衆人之後，出了地下室，與駱君上樓暢談，至十一時方告辭囘寓。</p>
<p>我在地下室中，于緊急警報發出以後，在黑暗中起了不少的感想：第一，就是個人對于生死的觀念，我以爲人生卽有死，誰也不能避免死亡的來臨，但也要死得其道，死得其時，和死得其所，所以在應當死的時候，正不必怕死，反之，在不當死的時候，也不容經生。因此×人來空　的時候，我們應同時盡最大的努力，作積極的和消極的抵抗，免除無謂的犧牲，和削弱　戰的人力和物力：第二，覺得重慶有五六十萬的人口，所有的防空壕最多可以容納十萬人，尙有四五十萬人卽非疏散不可，說到疏散，卽聯想到一般交通工具的缺乏，數十萬人口將由何法遷出市區？還有鄉村治安的窳陋，一旦分散到四鄕以後，是否容許外來人得以安居？這幾點均爲値得討論的問題：第三，防空壕到底是否可靠？如上次西安××××正在開會的時候，突遇空襲，卽在××們避躱的防空壕的兩個洞口，一個中了爆炸彈，一個中了燒夷彈，於是一個洞口被炸擁塞了，另一個則被烟焰冲入，以致壕內的人們多數是窒息而死。重慶雖多石山，但聞石質甚鬆，易受震裂，倘然壕溝開得過大，或山石特別鬆脆，就容易「入土爲安」。第四，重慶避空襲的人們，都自信有一個固定的時間，大槪上午八時至下午二時爲避襲時間，所以婦孺在此時間內避往甫岸，學校上課銀行辦公，均規定不在這個時間以內，但是×人眞的不能於午後，甚至夜間來襲嗎？第五，許多市民，除了四鄉治安不良爲理由外，還有鄉村沒有自來水，電燈，電話，和新式交通工具等等的設備，以爲不易疏散的理由，如果每一個鄕村都與都市一樣，是否可以保持避免空襲的危險嗎？</p>
<p>第二天早晨見到各報登載：『昨夜九時十分空襲警報』接着另一標題爲：『疏散人口，刻不容緩』，明明通知閱者，昨晚的警報不過演習而巳。事有凑巧，廿九日十一時五十分，眞警報果然來了，那次我和同事章君，正走在馬路上，預備赴友人之宴，突聞警報，就到附近的中國銀行暫避，但地下室巳吿客滿，空氣混濁，我們且在會客室談天，預備緊急警報時再下去，結果警報解除，隨即離去。次日的報上載有：昨日×機三十六架分二批來襲，因我機迎戰，始在梁山投彈而逸。經過這二次的敎訓，不知市民的心理對於疏散人口問題，能得到較爲順利的解决否？</p>
<p>經過兩次警報的恐嚇，敏感的我出門的時候，腦筋中映現下面幾種幻像：第一，走在都郵街上去只見萬頭鑽動，心中就怪難過的想到了將來大刼來臨時死亡枕籍的幻像；第二，見到市內建築的密集，和材料的陋　，而浮起一個被投燒焰彈後，全市大火的幻像；第三，見到摩登女子顯露了雪白的製臂和玉腿，心中也浮起了一重血肉糢糊的幻像；第四，碰到活潑可愛的小寶寶，也突然映演了一個慘白孩屍的幻像。報紙上戰有北培接到夜襲警報，卽有人失足於山洞，以致死亡；市內防空壕因爭奪避襲，以致有毆傷的種種新聞。我替重慶市民揑了一把冷汗，一個人　沒父母，兄弟和妻子？誰不寶貴自己和家族的生命？除了因職種關係而不能離開的人們，何不實行疏散把家屬早行遷到四鄉去呢？抗戰到底，最重要的人力和物力，皆賴後方民衆底支持，倘然懸空犧牲了生命，就是對不起國家，與士兵開小差無具，市民應該覺悟了吧！</p>

<h3 id="c35">香港的花工蘭 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>中國歷史上的花木蘭，留芳千秋，傳譽中外，替婦女界爭光不少。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，各地女子踴躍參加，自戰爭服務團，到隨軍服務團，還有協助維持後方秩序的壯丁隊自衛團，甚至還有參加　線抗戰的女學生軍。這種矢為國家服務為民族犧牲的女子，其偉大的精神，不僅可與古代的花木蘭媲美，而且還有其更重大的意義，卽是她們用自己的奮鬥，提高她們在政治上在社會上的地位，開拓了婦女解放的坦道。不祇是為了偶然的傳奇的造成幾個女英雄，而是爲了廣大的婦久大衆永遠與澈底的解放。</p>
<p>但是，在香港的婦女，却一向被輕視着，她們被　做男性的玩具或附屬物，她們被强迫着成爲商品，她們成爲社會的害虫，罪惡的謀介。這是香港婦女，也是全中國婦女的恥等，這種恥辱從抗戰以後還未洗清，而且隨着「高等難民」和「貧苦難民」的　到，這種恥辱是更加嚴重地威脅着我們女同胞們了！</p>
<p>社會的領袖份子，婦女界的先覺，對于此種現象，是不能不　感責任之重大的。</p>
<p>但是，「香港的花木蘭」，近來已經一再出現。他們沒有社會領袖的像捧優伶捧明星的捧場，也沒有報紙替他們刊登「玉照」廣大宣傳，她們是沉默地决堅地擺脫了撫裘，說　了安樂窩，回到祖國，囘到故鄉，去爲戰士服務，甚至去執戈衛國了！她們沒有榮利的貧圖，甚至她們苦戰負傷，無人救治，她們苦戰至死，亦無人知！然而她們却發揚了中華民　崇高的道德，偉大的精神·她們這種不求閱達誓死鬥爭，却將洗晚婦女界的恥羞，提高婦女界的社會地位與政治地位！</p>
<p>廣州　青年會隨軍服務團，昨日在本港　青年會舉行授旗體，該團行—四人，日內即將赴韶關前線服務，我們對於這羣新的香港的花木蘭，雖用盡一切光榮美麗的詞句，也不能形容其偉大的！他們都是年輕的女郎，她們都有一般人所艷羨的靑春，然　她們擺脫了愛撫，學業和職業，踏上限苦門爭　　服務的征途，她們不爲名，不為利，也沒有任何誘惑，什麼力量能逼人捨棄愛撫與安樂而赴犧牲奮鬥之途呢？我們除了歌頌她們的意見和英勇以外，能不爲中華民族的勝利前途而興奮鼓舞呢？</p>
<p>迷惑於愛與女樂中的女同胞們，你們不嬰驗紅羞愧嗎？在痛苦與黑暗欺凌侮辱中呻吟的女同胞們，你們不要有所動於衷嗎？從鏡花泡影般愛撫與安樂中警醒吧，從痛苦黑暗中警醒吧，自救的路，光明的火炬，勝利的旗幟，已在你們面前了！</p>

<p>【美倫社敦廿四日電】英內閣本日黃昏在下院首相辦公室舉行閣議歷二時十五分、討論强制兵役、一般相信、當徵十九歲至廿五歲之國民入伍、此項問題、當於星期三之例會中、重加討論、正式明令、當可於週尾之前發表、「每日先驅報」與「新聞紀事報」稱、內閣已决定批准强制乓役之原則、首先當徵十八歲至廿歲之國民　　、正式决定當視希特勒廿　日之演說內容而定、「新聞紀事報」並稱、某閣員會表示、如召集十九歲國民入伍、卽可增加五十萬地方軍、</p>

<h3 id="c37">日本的精神動員 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 之遺</p>
<p>銀座是東京的闢加狄萊繁華街、各色各樣的霓紅燈、街上炫燿奪目、</p>
<p>但是現在却不再有這種淸形了、東京又成了一條條陰森、凄凉暗淡的　、一個觀光者、當他在凹凸曲折的路面上踏着時、第一個問題便是「東京是否在準備着空襲」、</p>
<p>當他知道空襲是只限於中　城市時、他又無疑的要懷疑或許東京是在戰爭的威脅之下、正在設法節省其電氣供給、但是、他又猜錯了、</p>
<p>無疑的、日本的一切是置在嚴格的經濟統制和限制的制度之下的、但是廢止霓紅燈和其他許多類似的事情、在正常的經濟上、是沒有多大關係的、因爲電氣是日本最廉價的產品、</p>
<p>他們所以要把日常生活弄得這樣慘淡的理由、無非是使一般在『後方的前線』的人們、儘量的體味着那些前方士兵在戰塲上的苦况、這就叫做精神動員、</p>
<p>參加精神動員的人們、在這裏、已經組成了極有力的團體、同時自從他們把旭日旗作爲他們的象徵、又把所謂「日本精神」作爲他們的基礎以後、</p>
<p>一切莫明其妙的計劃、都成了國策了、</p>
<p>這種精神動員、在某一點上講、也許能代表日本人民的一點特性——這就是人喜亦喜、人悲亦悲的馴服性、爲表示同淸於在前線的士兵要求他們犧牲這些奢侈的享受、放棄一些享樂的習慣、是很可以使他們感動酌、</p>
<p>但是精神動員者却把這種十分自然的情感、推演到了最可笑的極端、由於過份節約的努力、引起一般人生活上嚴重的威脅、這里、一個主要的經濟問題、乃是怎樣達到國際貿易的平衡、而同時又不至於造成太多的失業者、例如　前對于棉花和木料入口的嚴格限制、便無法避免在、般紡織業方面產生出大量的失業者、</p>
<p>精神動員的頂點、又造成了一部分人過分的與　奮、他們要求人民不再建造新的屬房、不穿新的衣服、不赴要會、廢除常用的飄帶和領結、及一切人間舒適享　和娛樂、甚至於一切的必需品都在棄之列、不問其是否會引起大批人們慘遭失業、</p>
<p>但是、當他們差不多達到了由政府來禁止百　公司、電影院、酒菜館等公共場所裝置調節氣的設備時、他們就再也無所用其技了、</p>
<p>有一個酒萊館主人曾、要是沒有調節空氣的設儂他那精美的地下小酒菜館、便只好　門、而這區區二角五分錢一天的支出、正維持着約五十人的工作、</p>
<p>但是精神動員者的弓上又得到了另一根弦、他們的主要辯白、是說要藉此造成一種猛熱的空氣、他們說戰們的　線士兵正在、一百十度至一百二十度的暴熱下發昏、我們爲什麽不應該如此呢、此種　白幾乎也爲人所信服、很少有一個熱情的官吏願意表示、他要使後方人民的頭腦比較前線的士兵們冷靜一些、</p>
<p>精神動員最顯着的一個特微、是攻擊一切多少帶西洋性質的享樂、奢華、娛樂和宴會、現在在日本、赴舞龐、或組織跳舞會、跳舞旺、實際上已等於一種犯罪行爲、卽使是外國人甚至於外交人員、也不准舉行跳舞會、</p>
<p>這種行爲的理由是說、以他們熱情的頭腦覺得、靑年男女在一起跳舞、要不及於亂、是絕對不可能的、</p>
<p>他們對於一般所認爲道德、是不加注意的、他們只是反西洋、而其頑固的排外主義、較之無　識的中國拳匪、實在是有過之、而無不及的、（驛自倫敦「北方通訊」）</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>廣州女青年會隨軍服務團昨行授旗禮</p>
<p>大時代關不住女兒心，她們終於丟胭脂粉匣，着起戰時袍了。</p>
<p>廣州淪陷的時候，×人的無情炮火把廣州女靑年拆散了。但是，這是暫時的拆散，這是生長與鍛鍊的過程。她們流落了一個時候之後，又是堅强地，英勇地，組織起來，在香港和各地努力展開了一切的工作了。</p>
<p>昨晚八時起，廣州女靑年會隨軍服務國在本港女靑年會舉行授旗典禮，這精神的表現，直是「女性之光」與「民族之光」，織成了偉大的塲面。</p>
<p>她們這一群優秀的兒女，——十四人——有些是廣州的學生，有些是本港的學生，還有些是放棄職業而來的。這年輕的一群——十五六歲至二十歲左右——有的是健康的體格，活潑的精神和警覺的頭腦。綠色的軍裝，藍色的領帶，白色的手套，赳赳地，「誰能辨我是雌雄」。在座擁擠着的一二百位女朋友從此慚愧，感佩，而得到了新的啓示。</p>
<p>在嚴肅空氣籠罩之下，隆重的儀式一幕幕演下去：</p>
<p>主席陳佐旋夫人說：我們不能因爲逃難而忘記愛國；應該因爲逃難而更加愛國。——這自是針對着香港社會的中肯之言。</p>
<p>何香凝先生主持授旗禮之後，全團團員宣誓：「服從總理遺敎，擁護最高領袖。爲抗戰效勞，任何犧牲，在所不惜」。——大家身上的血循環，迅速地轉流着。</p>
<p>宣誓後，再由何香凝先生致訉，她首先引伸總理的三民主義與耶蘇的自由，平等，博愛相吻合，我們應該『聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥，』繼謂上前綫服務傷兵難民，要愛護我們這許多民族的精華。末以在上海服務傷兵的經驗，勗勉團員不怕臭，不怕髒，要爲國家而勇敢工作。——長者仁心，句句動人。</p>
<p>女青年會會長胡繼洪夫人說：我們要挺起胸膛上前線，不該有兒女的情惜別。『我來服侍人，非是人來服侍我。』耶蘇『替門生洗脚』的精神，是我們的榜樣。</p>
<p>香港女靑年會，眞光女中各校獻旗之後，就是該團團長鄭慶光致答詢。</p>
<p>他把前線將士英勇苦幹的情形，以及他們服務的經過，很生動地向大家報告。聽到「身上生虱』，『鹹魚臘腸歌』「十七歲女孩指導全軍遊戰」……尤其使人捧腹，讀嘆！他們的工作眞偉大！他們的精神眞愉快！</p>

<p>「拿打素」醫院將院址讓給該團訓練三星明予以種種的便利。又蒙中外熱心人士如美人拿地尼夫人和婦女兵災會等慨捐鉅款與藥物，這些，都是該團感激的助力。尤其是以精神上，物質上援助廣州女靑年會的原來造一位華南區女靑年會總幹事，美籍「遠美　」女士，國際友人之高貴同情，給我們更深刻地體認抗戰一定勝利，人類的正義與公理，是一天一天在放　着它的光彩。</p>

<p>福州海面　遇×騷攏</p>
<p>此事之發生時間為本月十八日，地點在福州，當時本輪正停泊于福州滄石海面，地點在中國軍事當局在福州所設之封鎖綫外、正由福州载運貨物準備開行赴汕頭、然後由汕來港、同時在該處停泊者尙有其他貨船商船四艘，一爲英國商船海口號、一爲希瞰貨船巴拿（譯音）號、其餘兩艘爲挪威貨船三民號、及大利華號、上述四輪均與本輪同泊于封銷綫外、同時並有由福州接載貨物之駁艇數艘、則在各輪附近停泊、駐福州護僑之英艦史葛號、亦駐泊于各輪之附近、本月十八日午間、突有侵入　海之×艦一艘、派出×兵數十人、駕電輪駛至各輪停泊地點、×兵先登大利華及三民兩輪肆意騷擾、</p>
<p>縱火焚船　×機威脅</p>
<p>當時附泊在兩輪之載貸駁艇共有數艘之多、均滿載福州出口貨物、準備由三民輪轉遝出口者、×兵登棆騷擾一番後、即下駁艇大肆投索、並將其中一艘拖去、當×兵肆虐時、並有×機多架在各輪上空低飛盤旋、藉以威脅、英艦史　號卽于此時派水兵多名，乘電輪開抵本輪（新海門）嚴密保護、×兵將大利華三民兩輪駁艇騷擾、英艦派來之英名長官、當卽向×交涉、×兵因見本掄有英兵保獲、旋卽囘返電船、退囘×艦、</p>
<p>擄去兩輪　放還一艘</p>
<p>翌日（十九日）×電船一艘又再來，當時海口輪已離福州、開行在滄石海面、停泊者僅餘本輪及三民、大利華、巴比拿四　、×兵又復登三民大利華各輪、本輪船主、深恐×兵又再肆虐、急卽命令各駁艇赶速囘港內、×兵旋登本輪、由船主及英艦長官會見×兵、先問本輪之國籍、船主卽答以英國商船，×乓繼又向所載貨物是否運往中國、船主答以貨物係運來香港、×兵不得要領卽退囘電輪、旋復至大利華三民兩輪、以武力脅迫船主尾隨×艦駛離福州、聞已被據至台灣、當本輪開離福州時、三民輪已獲釋開返、但大利華至今尙未有釋放消息、據悉該被據之挪威船大利華號、船上滿儎木料，一月前與其同一公司之兄弟輪某號原擬由福州儎貨開上海、但第一艘開行後、卽在途中被×艦據去、故公司當局乃電令大利舉號暫時停泊于福州、不可開行、該綸奉令在福州停泊幾月餘、卒之不免被×艦拘去云、</p>

<p>港汕輪裕生號由汕到港、記者到輪訪問汕市近况、爰將所得彙誌如下、</p>
<p>疏散情形</p>
<p>據船員稱、汕頭自入戰時準備後、居民紛紛疏散、汕頭往潮州各屬一帶公路上行人絡繹、各工廠現將機器還往八邑內地者巳佔十之八九、疏散經過情形、秩序良好、刻下留于汕市者係屬當地防軍自銜團、及一部份因商業關係不願離開者、至地方仍安謐如常</p>
<p>貨運略少</p>
<p>惟汕頭情形雖極緊張、而港汕貨運仍照常、普通貨物比較從前爲少、至於穀米則仍繼續源源由港付寄，盞潮洲各屬米糧多靠外處供給、由汕轉連、現目仍須多量運入接濟、</p>

<h3 id="c60">籃球聯會今夕開會　商討申報杯義賽　暑天已屆希望趕快些舉辦 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>（本報專訊）去歲底、本報曾向籃球聯會献議、設法舉辦女子義實、籌集善款、履濟雖胞、獎杯則由本報捐出、當時聯會主席高鍚威先生　表贊同、乃於執行委員會議時提出討論、决議舉辦在案、</p>
<p>後來聯會改選職員及　着公開男子聨賽要舉辦、正因事忙、遂把義　的議决案攔置起來、直至現在、還未有究竟何時舉辦的確息、</p>
<p>聯會自新職員產出後、對於會務進行、異常積極、深得各方好評故希望該會別忘記義赛這囘事、最好在最近期內、設法使之實現、若不趕快舉辦、到了酷暑天氣、便不大適宜、因爲那窄狹的籃球房、在暑天裏要舉辦吸引多量數看客　比賽、實在不行、</p>
<p>總說　會爲了這件未了的事情、記着未皆忘記、將於今大晚上、召開執委會議、商討籌備舉辦的事宜、</p>
<p>關於參加隊伍、某關係方面的意思、以爲此乃義賽、最好取其公開、每一個單位、不論學校也好、團體也好、總求能够組成强勁的隊伍參加競賽、不必嚴格限制、若然如此、可使整個　會、增加與趣不少、何况此是　舉、唯一意義乃替難胞請命、錦標主義毋　過於重視、在球人方面、僅舉手之勞、又何樂不爲呢、（東郎）</p>

<p>全港公開網肆單打半决賽、昨日下午、徐煒培與大林珍相遇、慕名往觀者極衆座無虛席、此場比賽、取五盤三勝制、開賽時間提前十五分鏑、</p>
<p>第一盤、大林珍以攻爲守、正手袖掃、漂亮情趣、一路佔先、以五比二得絕對優勢、衆以爲大徐必放棄第一盤、慳囘氣力、在第二盤然後打算、乃大徐沉着應戰、以左撇右撥之割球、追至五比五和局、大林珍賮力還擊、一抽一壓、精美異常、掌聲不絕、以六比五再度領先、大徐不以爲意、從容挑撥、卒以九比七得第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤、大徐變更戰略、以還攻近盤之手法、使大林珍四處奔走、降具氣力、大林珍努力應付、雖多耗損、亦所不計、一路猛抽、有志竟成、以六比二得囘一盤、但此時已氣喘如牛矣、</p>
<p>第三盤、大徐乘對手疲倦中、開始抽壓、角度凖確而尖銳、大林珍應付爲難、無法還搫、于是大徐遂以六比一之紀錄、再獲一盤、</p>
<p>第四盤、大徐在第三盤中形勢好轉、至此决戰之心更雄、雖大林珍殊不示弱、曾以三比一局佔先、詎大徐又抖搜精神、神威大發、長撇短擊、在在得宜、遂一氣呵成、連勝五局、以六比三完成最後一盤、總結果三比一大徐得勝、</p>
<p>今日又有單打半决賽一場舉行、徐潤培對李應堂、小徐乃新進翹楚、本領不凡、李則富於經騐、常能以巧制勝、今日與小徐相遇、球藝各有千秋、故勝利誰屬、未政預斷也、</p>

<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>抗戰釗了現階段、戰區幾遍及全國、華北華中華東華南、都已滿布了戰雲、且在「游華戰」「運動戰」「陣地戰」聯合發動之下、幾無時無地、不發生戰事、軍事方面消耗資財的鉅大、可以意想得之、我們要補償這種消耗、一方面固然要　源、一方面還得要節流、任何一個民衆、任何一種事業、倘能多節省一文金錢、抗戰的經濟力就充俗一分、抗戰的持久性就延長一刻、最後勝利的把握就多着一分、</p>
<p>體袼鍛鍊事業倘能力事節約、多少終可有補於抗戰的經濟、這是目前運動、必須合乎經濟的原則者、</p>
<p>這次抗戰、旣是全面的、我們就應當本着領袖「人不分男女壯幼個個抗戰」的昭示、每個中華民族的民衆、都負起一分抗戰責任、要負起這堅苦困難的責任、非各迅速的具備着鍋鉄一般體格、决難勝任　快、要使每個人能迅速具備堅强的體格非先有在短時間內能使每個人切實實行的運動、從事鍛練不爲功、動作複雜、方法繁多、消耗於學習時間多、實行於鍛練恃間少、或少數人能學習、多數人難學習的運動、决不是我們理想需要的運動、這是目前運動、必須合乎易學的原則者二、</p>
<p>基於前述每個人必須具備堅强體格來支撐危局的理由、那麼這趣運動、非在我們四萬萬五千萬人民之中、三千五百萬方里國土以內、春夏秋冬、風雨晨昏之時、人人可以實施、處處可以實施、時時可以實施不可、倘要限人數、限場地、限天時、限設備等等、少數人民、少數地域　少數時間能行、而多數不能的運動、决難　普遍實施、廣大收效的成果、這是目前的運動、必須合乎易行的原則者二、</p>
<p>方今的運動方法、中國的、外洋的、舊有的、新興的、多得數不勝數、我們試根據上述三原則來檢討一下、究竟那些是適合目前的需要？是找國運動者听認爲打球卽體育、非球不運動的球類運動吧、購球需錢、築場設備需錢、它不合經濟的原則、動作複羅、方法繁多、不是多數沒有運動天才和根基的人所能學習、它不合易學的原则、人多人少不能　、沒有場地和設備不能行、它不合易行的原則、是身手矯健最足炫爛一時的田徑赛運動吧、它多少與球類運動有同病相憐之憾、是騎馬游泳以及一切器械體操吧、它們不是需要經費設備、就是難學、或須選擇時地、方能實行、這都不是我們目前環境卜急切需要的運動、我以爲我們目前需要的運動、就是「國術」「體操」和「跑步」『爬山』四種、試申言其理</p>
<p>國術和體操、有設備可以做、沒有設備也可以做、這是經濟、一人可以做、千百人也可以做、天晴在賑場上可以做、下雨在斗室中也可以做、這是易行、它們的動作、雖然也須畢習、但一經指導、任何人都能依樣仿做、而學會一部或一套以後、可以終身行之不輟、這是易學、</p>
<p>爬山和跑步、不但絕不需要設備、化一文小錢、更不必從事學習、只要能走能跑、决沒有不會做這種運動的、雖然跑步在雨天時有困難、爬山在沒有山的地方行不通、不過遇到天雨的時候、可以用國術或體操來代替、無山可爬的地方、可以用跑步來代替、仍不背易行的原則、</p>
<p>總之、我們倘能把這四種運動、交替的行起來、不但行不通的、可以互相代替、就是爬山和跑步偏於下肢的、可以用國術和體操的上肢運動來補救、國術的動作、四肢較多的、可以用體操的軀幹動作來補救、初練或體弱的人、不能卽行爬山和跑步的、可以用國術和體操來打好根基、每個人倘果眞能抱着决心做去、那麽不論男女、無分壯幼、在斗室之中、荒山之間、風雨之時、寒暑之節、無地無時、無不能在不化一錢的情形下實行運動、眞正達到普遍改　體格的使命、</p>
<p>有人說這些運動、呆板枯燥、缺乏興味、免强做來、精神上定感、痛苦、不如球類和田經等運動、自由活潑、與趣濃厚、可以使人發生自　綀習的意向、價值來得宏大、誠然、有些人確能有這種現象、筆者向來也愛好　種迷動的、對此說深表同意、</p>
<p>不過我們試仔細檢討一下、全民能做球類等運動的、有多少、學校裏有着正式功課、成日在訓練這種運動的、結果怎樣、不是養成少數有運動天才的特殊選手嗎、運動場不是成了少數飛掦跋扈的運動員的專利品嗎、多數學生、還不是不知這些運動爲何物、雖有若無嗎、所謂興趣、不過是少數人的興趣罷了、</p>
<p>至於說國術和體操動作的呆板、爬山和跑步的缺乏興味、眞是沒有認淸這些運動的眞義、所謂動作呆板、絕不是它們本身的問題、而是操法和取材的問題、同是一種村料、呆板者可以改良操法使之活潑、而取材方面、呆板活潑、更可隨意左右、爬山跑步、鍛煉體格之外、並能領略大自然的景色、游目騁懷、到達目的地以後、高歌一曲、更能陶冶性、實不是固於一隅的球類等運動所能企及、何况國術殲敵、已有不可磨滅的偉　、抗戰轉入山岳地帶後、翻山越嶺、疾進速退的技、更於爬山跑步有至密之關係呢、</p>
<p>一種事業的成功、必從艱苦中奮鬥而得、所謂「苦盡甘來」、『吃盡苦中苦、方爲人上人、』就是這個意思、倘因爲『乏味』『痛苦』就舍棄了不做、那麽我們今日的抗戰、在死裏求生、可說堅苦無比、成日處心積慮的計劃殺敵致果、可說乏味這極、也可以就此罷手、安心作敵人的奴隸牛馬了、豈是應有的態度、</p>
<p>同胞們、到了這生死存亡的最後關頭、我們似不應不顧事實、不察環墝、仍惟逸樂是求、興趣是尙、專好做那貴族化、媿樂性的運動、而不肯堅定意志、　覆難困苦中奮鬥、來求民族的解放、國家的自由吧、</p>

<h3 id="c67">德國之安定物價政策 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 陳寶鎔譯</p>
<p>本文係德國經濟學家華格氏所作、根據日文國際經濟週報第九九一期轉譯而來、原題爲「價格之形成及其安定政策」！譯者</p>
<p>以勞動爲基礎之貨幣制度、</p>
<p>物價政策之中心問題、不外爲安定價格之問題、當經濟內部發生劇烈變化時、如何使物價市場不起愛化是也、對於此種事實、常有種種認爲無可抵抗之理由甚至所謂「數量景氣』、即成立於「價格景氣」、蓋在過去資本及其收益、恒占經濟生活之中心、而今日吾人之欲分析一切經濟現象之關鍵、則將於勞動及其給付中求之、因此、德國之貨幣制度、最初雖樹立於金之基礎上、而今日則已改取勞動爲其基礎、最初、吾人認爲欲保障國民將來之物質生活、莫如蓄積貨幣、今則對於貨幣之此種保證、已失去具信心、代之以起者、爲吾人對於勞働之權利、並需與以永久的勞働權利而後可、且不僅在於勞働進行上之權利、進而復應保證其任何時期之所得</p>
<p>德國之新物價政策</p>
<p>德國國社政府之經濟理論、旣根本上採取此種　的態度、於是對于物價變動之影響及其所以發生變動之種種原因、更可以景氣變動而加以說明、從而國社政府之新物價政策、不僅以排除當前之阻碍爲滿足、過去最優秀之物價委員、僅需以敏捷之方法、解决其現實問題、而今則在現實問題外、復有解决其根本原則之必要、即如何使物價之變化、與今日經濟生活完全適應、高物價政策即努力提高物價而謀恐慌之克復的政策、固未始不可以刺激一般之經濟而認發景氣、但物價之暴　、實具有種種重大之危險、不能不予以深切之警戒、在過波時期、高物價雖不無起活潑經濟之作用、但同時實亦在製造殺人之毒素、故德國國家社會主義、雖並不無條件的反對物價之上昇、又並不無條件的採行阻止物價上昇之政策、並對于此種企圓、本質上亦與一般所行之政策完全不同、一言以蔽之、卽謀樹立一適正之價格是、</p>
<p>確立『適正的價格』</p>
<p>當經濟上一切方面發現價格昂騰之傾向時、卽一方已影響及對外的經濟關係、而起不良之作用、他方又因負祖之增大而使原料經濟發生變化、此種傾向、且猶不能將支配經濟各部門恐慌、充分予以克服、在此場台、國社政府一方設定『最高價格』、使充分而合　地完成物價政策上之活潑計劃、以謀建設可能性之維持、他方則將各經濟部份、予以個別而根本的檢討、務使各部面之物價、皆與該部面之特質相應、卽個別的適用各種特殊的統制、</p>
<p>考察價格政策、旣不能僅就貨幣物價方面着眼、如用此種觀點、且亦不能與其目的一致、普通、在價格跌落時、總希望其回升、特不知價格之高低、并非主要問題、眞止主要者、在于價格間之互相關係是否平衡、對于國民經濟生活以及其他要素上是否相互適應、換言之物價水凖是否維持適正關係、乃係問題重心、</p>
<p>所謂『適正之關係』、概决之於國民經濟、故價格概念、須中國民經濟全體之立場而予以批判、卽一方由經營上予以批判、他方以市場價格予以批判、</p>
<p>今日德國之物價、一方與生產相適應、他方與勞動所得相適應、德國元首對於德國經濟惟一最關心之事、今日已停在如何調　必要之勞動而已、</p>
<p>德國價格政策之任務</p>
<p>近年德國之價格政策、雖已執行其安定經濟生活之機能、惟猶未能卽以此爲克盡其任務、因在某種時期、應設法减輕外來之價格騰貴影響（卽减輕世界物價騰貴之影響）、某種時明、應設法帮助開拓販賣市場、確立適當而有力之價格、當新原料之技術的發展之後、则又應確定其如何出　於市場之價格、乃至在解决一切社會政策上之所需、以及解决供給上之技術問題等等、在價格政策上、槪可發生其新任務、</p>

<h3 id="c70">論行好事張春風 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>馮瀛王有詩云：『但知行好事，莫要問前程，」這樣砌人爲着的一句話，和「笑　出他哭爲，好官我自爲之」的一句話，有同樣的　毅不屈的精神。</p>
<p>其實這兩句詩，在今天來論，確須先要加一個註腳才可以，否則，極易令人大上其當的。比如說人人都知道爲國輸財是好事，是每個中國人應盡的責任，但就免不了肖小之輩的趁機歛財，詐騙訛取，就如前些日子竟有人冒　術展覽助賑之名，大行斂財手段，結果義金歸　，席捲善欵而逃。由此可見好事雖是該行，一但須問一問前程，才是台理的手段，否則不止受騙，而小人却正好籍了這兩詩句大施　術，那是我們應先加以提防的。</p>
<p>宋理學家邵康節有訓子語云：「汝固當爲善，亦須量力以爲之，若不量，雖善亦不當爲也」。</p>
<p>這話雖　馮濂王的詩句爲合理，但亦不過只看到一面，欠看另一面。就是行好事的人當然要有　的工夫，那意思是就施善的對方，亦該有一番量的工夫，量不祇是度量，衡量，也是實地考核的工夫，就如前些日，藉藝展騙錢的人，在他剛行騙之初，如果社會人士加過一番懷疑考核的工夫，大槪騙計不會得售的。</p>
<h3 id="c71">雅與俗 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>從前倪雲林雅士，因爲不肯替張士信作書，有一天在太湖裏被張士信捉了起來，鞭打幾死。可是在被鞭打時，不發，言。有人問他原故，他說：一開口就俗了。</p>
<p>不得了，這樣的雅士，連性命都不顧，眞正少見。然而這樣的做作，不也有一些太雅之嫌否？因爲在我看來，不開口只能算作强硬不屈，是個好漢，與雅無關，如果存心要以此爲雅，就未免太雅而成俗了。</p>
<p>太雅成俗，正如儒林外史中所說的「雅得太俗」一樣。當時一般斗方名士，動不動就飲酒看花，吟詩作賦，自命風雅，於是給吳敬梓大大地嘲笑了一陣，至今當爲話柄。</p>
<p>話說這種雅習，到了今天，似乎流風餘韻，依然未絕，或者竟　變本加厲，有行必雅，無事肯俗。別的不必說，卽以幾個人的台甫雅籇，別號筆名而言，早已竭盡雅之奇觀，不能不使人嘆爲雅之標致。有一個時期，名字總用花鳥蟲角來代表，而以哀怨愁苦的形容詞來陪襯。這可以說是軟派的雅。現在呢，總算變了，都用口口口口口，口口口口這些字眼來取名了。這也許可以說是硬派吧。</p>
<p>我不是說，這些名字根本不雅。適得其反，我是承認它們是雅的。可是一人始倡，多人從風，任何雅事，都成了俗不可耐，正如宋之穌東波是雅人多雅事。明之唐伯虎張孟晉之流，邯鄲學步，扭揑作態，就使人要發嘔了。</p>
<p>要一定專爲雅與俗下定義，當然不是容易的。不過我說，這裏面似乎也有一些範圍，除了始倡者雅，從風者俗以外，還有：有意者俗，無心者雅。倪雲林之俗，我就爲了他的有意，他本來是元來明初人，正合了肉蒲圓上所說，元人是每個人　有一個別號的，所以他號爲雲林子，也就是他俗的表徵之一。至於他的故　嗜潔，無非學畢米元章，也徒見其俗氣熏人身。黨紀先生的在北京作詩，在河內作詩，正可以作如是觀：附庸風雅，俗俗俗！</p>
<p>莫君利哀——仿高君爾基的雅稱——所寫的『裝腔作勢』，就是爲這些雅人寫照的，我想要收集　項材料，恐怕古今中外，不知多少，正可以軍戰斗量，汗牛充棟吧。</p>
<p>不過雅事只於文人有份，不識字的渾人是無份的；因此旣有文人的太雅而成俗，也就有了渾人的太俗而成雅。黨太尉的銷金帳裏，羊羔美酒，就是這個明體，而梁山黑旋風開口老子，閉口鐵牛，實在嫵楣可愛，端的不俗，就是魯迅筆底下的阿Q，幾聲我要……，我也認爲是近代第二雅人。爲什麽？也不過爲了他們一片天眞，無心於雅，而所言所行，前不見古人，後不見來者，却自然地妙絕千古，俗得太雅耳。</p>
<p>文人中畢竟是黃山谷有點道理的，他到了宣州，有人請他寫字，他來者不拒，有求必應，有人因爲他給了俗人，爲他可借。他就笑着說，有不俗的人，引他一個來看看看，這話眞止痛快極了，反過來說，睢是雅人呢，誰不是俗人呢，於此，我也可以看出一些雅與俗的究竟來。</p>
<p>我時常聽見人們說，文章要做『雅俗共賞』，方爲妙文，這話，我有些不相信，因爲雅能賞的，俗未必能賞，俗能賞的，不一定雅能賞。因此，我想，也許『雅俗不共賞』，方是妙文吧，至於我這篇不妙文，旣難迫雅，又難階俗，也就只好說『雅俗共不賞』了。</p>

<p>剛　下飯碗，大麻子　細兒　又在矮屋萬　嘴啦。</p>
<p>『該死，真該死！』恕保叔公敲敲旱烟桿，伸出像柴校般的手，抹掉那染在　　上的粥湯，嘴動一動說：「這樣個勞口，還鬧死鬧活的鬧些什麽來着，飯還弄不到嘴，就有閑勁兒關，唉，唉！」他一邊在摸那已經空了的旱煙袋，一邊在嘆息。</p>
<p>恕保叔婆在屋簽下拆破機，把襪紗抽出來打成呦，見恕保叔公坐在門檻上嘆氣，掉轉　去看了他一眼：『老東西，少管人家閑事，自家管好了吧，旱烟少吃幾筒不會死。不聴見挑雜貨担兒的王二說嗎，上城裏批點貨色受著那些鬼子兵的氣。只差沒把頭上的氈帽除下，就給打得牙縫裏冒血，腰眼裏還被吃上兩槍柄。他賭咒不進城了，把底貨賣掉，寧可餓死在家裏，就敎你有錢也買不到烟吃。』她狠毒地說着。</p>
<p>『看這批惡鬼鬧到那一天……』恕保叔公掃與地接了一句口。</p>
<p>可是矮屋裏大麻子家媽兒倆格外鬧的厲害啦，咒罵，號哭和摔破碗的聲音都先後過來。剛才還敎恕保別管閑事的恕保叔婆，她却丟下破襛和綫團，第一個先跑到矮屋裏去，嘴裏還咕嚕着：『唉鬧，閙，鬧翻天還是媽兒倆……鬧出什麽油水來…』</p>
<p>恕保叔婆正要跨進矮屋的門檻，大　子的見子却拚命地打屋子裏竄出來，後面追着的正是大麻子的老婆，臉色氣得白裏泛靑，氣急喘喘，手裏揑着一根門閂，顯然是要追打她的見子。恕保叔婆眼快手快，一把把她拉住說：「幹嗎啦，發這樣大的脾氣，息息吧，媽兒倆有什麽天大的事，總好商酌。你家大麻子死後，就留下他這　貝欐，又沒多見多女在那裏。』</p>
<p>『叔婆，你故費，呃，今天我非要把他打個半死不可，他這忤逆種。他眼睛裏還有我這個媽嗎！』大麻子老婆一時消不掉這口氣憤。</p>
<p>恕保叔婆好容易把她帶勸帶拖的拖到自家門口來，端一張板凳給她坐下。「啊啊，大麻子家，這勞口甚麼可都只能馬虎些兒。』恕保叔公抹抹　髭打鬥檻上站起來，這麽說着。</p>
<p>「不瞞　公叔婆晚，別的都我肯依他，只有這件事不答應！』大麻老婆子咬咬牙齒，樣子很堅夾。恕保叔婆搶光的問：『究竟是什麽一回事呵？』大麻老婆子『哼』了一聲，就說上一長串：</p>
<p>『什麽一回兒事！他要去替××兵做小工呵，修汽車路！你這他的庭心好不　？大麻子是在汽車路旁邊　××兵一槍打死的，淡緣沒故，死得多可憐，躺在溝韶沿，　壳給打的粉碎，血往溝裏流，腦漿往溝裏流，那時××兵剛到，白天沒人敢去收尸，叙公叔婆都知道。還是夜裏請詞堂裏的江北佬偷去拖回來…他這忤逆種，不是瞎眼睛沒看見，現在他不想給爹報仇，反要去給鬼子兵去做小工。哼，掙錢！千萬兩銀子也不在乎，寗可餓死了，可不許他去掙血錢……我要他去看看他爹…大麻子的屍首…』她說到這裏，聲昔抖得不能再說去，她放聲大哭了。</p>
<p>恕保叔公聽得不服氣，把旱烟桿往石板上一敲，要去村上找大麻子的兒子來訓誠。『我們村上不許誰做漢奸！』他一邊自言自語地。</p>

<p>抗戰迄今，已閱二十一月，日本雖憑恃它自己軍械的精良，在彤式上得到了勝利，但所獲得的祇是幾道交通綫和幾個城市而已。廣大的地面，仍在華軍之手，而戰綫又是延長和散漫，犯兵家深之忌。如果一旦全綫反攻，各地都遭受截擊，聯絡中斷，首尾不能相顧，必成土崩瓦解之勢。然而，當初的日本掀起蘆溝橋事變時，原想佔些小便宜的，萬萬料不到會給它一個『長期抵抗』的最致命的報復。戰事擕演到現在，泥足愈陷愈深，窘態畢露。而自己的常備軍，後備軍，鮮台日軍，都抽調上了前綫去作戰，還覺得不够分配，而在佔領的『王道樂土』中，又碰來碰去是中國軍隊，得了這塊失了那塊，弄得頭暈目眩，疲于奔侖，可見日軍崩潰之期已在不遠，我們看下列電訊，更可得到有力的證明。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Promoting National Spiritual Mobilization: Shanghai's Anti-Traitor Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Press: Declaration Denouncing Traitors</p>
<p>(Special Shanghai Dispatch) The 21st was the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector in the city's spiritual mobilization. Practitioners in the city's press have issued a joint declaration, vehemently denouncing the fallacious arguments and reckless actions of traitors, and calling on all citizens to block all avenues for Wang Jingwei and his cohorts' activities. The full text of the declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>As the national resistance war has entered its second phase, Japanese imperialism has realized that its dream of annexing China by force is unattainable. Therefore, it is particularly focused on traitorous activities, on the one hand attempting to divide and disintegrate China's resistance front, and on the other hand concealing its new offensives, seeking to relax China's vigilance. Among these, the treacherous activities of Wang Jingwei and his cronies are particularly prominent, appearing with the guise of "peace" and "direct negotiations," spreading national defeatist sentiments with extreme viciousness. Wang's "peace" proposal echoes the smoke screen of Konoe's East Asia New Order. Although he himself can justify it, it is actually a thorough and utter condition for national subjugation. As Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "If this is considered peace, there is no word for surrender in the dictionary!" Today is the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector during the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. We solemnly declare: We are determined to exhaust our efforts to oppose the activities of aggressors and traitors. We will resist all activities of aggressors and Wang's clique! We demand that all citizens rise up together to oppose the ghostly actions of Wang and all traitors, and block the path for any activities by the Wang clique and all traitors.</p>
<p>Shanghai Main Newspaper Editorial: "Launch an Anti-Wang Movement"</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai Shen Bao's editorial on the 22nd of this month, titled "Launch an Anti-Wang Movement," reads: Today, as the national spiritual mobilization is being promoted, an anti-Wang movement should be launched immediately. Only anti-Wang is the most concrete manifestation of the concentrated will of all of China at this stage.</p>
<p>To recognize the necessity of the anti-Wang movement, it is necessary to first eliminate all excuses for Wang Zhaoming's actions. Some people believe that Wang Zhaoming's absurd behavior is nothing more than a temporary error in observation, and that his motives are still understandable. In fact, Wang Zhaoming's treachery was planned in advance. Therefore, he repeatedly made strange remarks, and finally colluded with Konoe in a charade, acting as an internal accomplice of the Japanese warlords. After the treachery became obvious, he showed no remorse, but instead intensified his actions, forging documents, spreading rumors, and instigating his followers to engage in traitorous organizations. Can this kind of planned and step-by-step action be considered a temporary error in observation? Others cherish Wang Zhaoming's past political life, believing that although he is currently misguided, he may be treated with leniency. In fact, forgiving a person is nothing more than hoping that they can repent. Since Wang Zhaoming will not repent, what is the use of forgiving him? Moreover, a person's goodness or evil depends entirely on their final performance. Although Wang Zhaoming's body has not yet reached the time to be buried, his spirit has already ended his life. He has already manifested himself as a national traitor. Even if he had one or two small good deeds in the past, how can they cover up his final treachery? Moreover, Wang Zhaoming's entire life history is one of speculation. In order to exert his desire for leadership, he habitually engaged in fickle and capricious activities. He cannot even be found to have engaged in minor good deeds and kept minor promises. What can we cherish about him? Still others believe that Wang Zhaoming has no masses except for a few henchmen, and that his remarks are merely personal actions and will not have any effect at all. They argue that we should let him destroy himself and not pay so much attention to him. In fact, it is true that Wang Zhaoming has no masses and is not worthy of attention. However, he is now a tool of the Japanese warlords. His master has taken out some money from that pitiful pocket to promote him and win over ugly people, with serious intentions. At the same time, his henchmen are actively working, planning to use printing materials or the education sector to carry out their ghostly tricks and achieve their conspiracy to bewitch people. If we do not prevent it and allow it to grow, it cannot be tolerated in the process of resistance war.</p>
<p>We only need to read Wu Zhihui's vernacular literary condemnation of Wang Zhaoming to know how deliberately he plotted to betray the country, how he became an internal accomplice of the Japanese warlords, destroyed his political life, and how he continued to carry out his conspiracy without remorse. Therefore, every Chinese should know that Wang Zhaoming is unforgivable, and that forgiving a traitor is a crime.</p>
<p>Since Wang Zhaoming offered his plan to subjugate China to his "friendly nation," Japan has begun a new offensive in Jiangxi and other places since early March. However, in addition to repeatedly stating its firm stance of resistance, the Chinese government is launching counter-offensives when the Japanese side is exhausted, and winning victories one after another. This is tantamount to shattering the joint conspiracy of the Japanese warlords and Wang Zhaoming. However, this is not enough. The Chinese people should coordinate the universal anti-Wang movement with the government's actions, so that Wang Zhaoming's conspiracy will not only be shattered temporarily, but will never happen again.</p>
<p>The content of the anti-Wang movement should be to eliminate all defeatist theories. First, resistance is a national policy, and victory in the resistance is an inevitable result. The facts of the past twenty-one months have proved that China has not been defeated at all, and Japan has already embarked on a path of defeat. Therefore, there is fundamentally no basis for the so-called "mutual destruction." Before reaching the goal of victory, there is fundamentally no peace to be discussed. If one talks about peace recklessly, that is treason. Second, China's united front is established based on actual needs. It is currently growing and being enriched, without any signs of rupture. Even after the resistance war ends in the future, China will still build a brand-new Three Principles of the People republic in the united front camp, and there is no possibility of rupture. Those who make unnecessary worries about China's future are also traitors. In the anti-Wang movement, everyone should bear the responsibility of reporting defeatist theories and correcting them.</p>
<p>The anti-Wang movement should be universal and organized. It should be coordinated with spiritual mobilization as one of the essential items for the implementation of spiritual mobilization. As for Shanghai, the anti-Wang movement should be led by the education sector, and the education sector itself should first conduct a thorough ideological purge, because the nature of the anti-Wang movement is the struggle for truth in consciousness, and it is most appropriate for the education sector to lead it. It is also widely rumored that Wang's henchmen are trying to carry out conspiracies in Shanghai's education sector, injecting ideological germs.</p>
<p>The anti-Wang movement should be expanded as much as possible into the guerrilla areas. Because in the areas controlled by the Japanese puppets, Chinese compatriots are subject to knowledge blockade and cannot easily understand the current situation in China. At the same time, the Japanese puppets are actively carrying out anesthetizing and enslaving spiritual training, promoting Wang Zhaoming as the true savior in puppet newspapers, deceiving Chinese compatriots. Therefore, the anti-Wang movement should infiltrate the occupied areas, using all possible methods to expose the Japanese puppets' intentions in promoting Wang, and promote the true meaning of resistance war, eliminating the spiritual imprisonment of suffering compatriots.</p>
<p>Youth Sector: Expanding the United Front</p>
<p>The 20th was the Propaganda Day for the education sector in the National Spiritual Mobilization. In addition to holding large-unit teaching of the outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization in all schools and publishing special issues in various newspapers, the Education Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association issued a letter to the city's youth. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Youths are the proud children of the era, with simple minds, intelligent brains, lively spirits, strong bodies, and a glorious revolutionary history. In China, whether it is politics, culture, or science, nothing has not been initiated, promoted, and transformed by youths, and gradually achieved its purpose. During the May Fourth Movement, our country's youths made brilliant contributions to the enlightenment of political culture. Even among the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, most of those who sacrificed were youths. After that, during the May 30th Movement, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, there was no time when youth students were not calling out and active in the great tide of national salvation. From the tense situation in North China to the sound of the anti-Japanese artillery fire at the Lugou Bridge, the dynamics of the youth are particularly worth exciting and encouraging. From the front lines to the rear areas, from regular warfare to guerrilla warfare, nearly hundreds of thousands of youths are braving the wind and rain, enduring hunger and cold, running around and working hard, and sacrificing to save the country. It is indeed worth writing a big book about in the history of national revolution. But what about the youths on our isolated island? There are certainly those who are diligent and hardworking and strive for the country, but more than 80% of the youths are still living their drunken and dreamy lives, maintaining their habits of living in a perfunctory and opportunistic manner, full of lifelessness, not seeking knowledge and not seeking action. All the pioneering and vigorous vitality, the determination to move forward bravely, the frugal and upright customs, and the moral values of loyalty, righteousness, and knowing shame have become as rare as the morning stars on the isolated island. Although there are more than one million youths on the isolated island, most of them are just waiting for the country to be subjugated or waiting for the arrival of victory, and are willing to abandon the sacred mission of saving and building the country during the Great Revolution. Even if they search their hearts in the quiet of the night, they cannot escape the curses of future generations. Now, we hope for the following from the city's youth:</p>
<p>Collective Struggle</p>
<p>The more advanced the society is, the more people's work tends to be collective. Only collective work can generate huge power. Especially in saving and building the country, it is necessary to organize all the people of the country and mobilize them in groups. The National Spiritual Mobilization is to use this group spirit and power to help the army resist the enemy and help the government build the country, so that the final victory, the revival of the nation, can be completed quickly. Therefore, young people should not only abandon their individualistic activities and enthusiastically participate in this group, but also automatically organize this group, or publicize and promote others to participate in this group.</p>
<p>Unified Belief</p>
<p>China's resistance war is not only to achieve national independence and freedom, but also to make nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood advance simultaneously and be implemented concretely. Since we are to build a free and happy new China based on the Three Principles of the People, then we must jointly believe in the Three Principles of the People, study the Three Principles of the People, promote the Three Principles of the People, and strive for the country's salvation for the Three Principles of the People. And after having a common belief, we will definitely be able to trust each other through common faith, making the united front of the people as strong as cement. With this, whatever obstacle cannot be destroyed, and with this to build the country, why worry about not achieving the goal.</p>
<p>Concentrated Will</p>
<p>During the resistance war, after having a common belief, there must also be a common will, without division and without confusion, moving towards a common goal, so that the enemy is weakened and shaken, and collapses from shaking. What is the common goal? That is, no matter what kind of work or career, we must not be afraid of hard work, design meticulously, so that it is helpful to the resistance war and beneficial to the country and the nation. In other words, we must always keep "national supremacy, national supremacy, national affairs first, and victory first" in mind and use it as the future of all work and careers.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Reform</p>
<p>In addition to the above, personal habits and lifestyle also have a great impact on the resistance war and national construction. Economic and time waste will certainly weaken the economy of the resistance war and delay the time of victory. It is to say, being sluggish and lazy, living in a perfunctory and opportunistic manner, and being mediocre and romantic are enough to subjugate the country. Moreover, front-line soldiers are sacrificing for the nation, and countless compatriots are suffering for the country. How can we alone enjoy ourselves? As for the young people studying at school, they should especially be diligent, hardworking, and vigorous, and be a model for the general youth, working for the resistance war and seeking knowledge for national construction. From today onwards, we ask to jointly assume the responsibility of saving and building the country, so that both economy and time can move towards the great road of revolution.</p>
<p>Cultural Sector: Declaration Supporting Resistance</p>
<p>The 21st was the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector. All newspapers and magazines in the city were mobilized to complete their missions in their respective positions. The following is a copy of a declaration: Today is the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector of the National Spiritual Mobilization. We, members of the cultural sector, are members of the nation and should actively participate in the spiritual mobilization movement, reverently swear to abide by the National Covenant, and practice the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline promulgated by the Central Government with all our strength. Culture is originally the spiritual industry of the country and the nation. The cause done by the cultural sector is the spiritual cause of the country and the nation. Therefore, the responsibility of the cultural sector to promote national spiritual mobilization is particularly important. Now, let's talk about it separately based on the views of our colleagues: The three major elements of war are manpower, financial resources, and military force. This is generally recognized. Manpower is the integrated and leading force of these three major elements, and spirit is the original driving force of all manpower. Specifically, spirit is the comprehensive, integrated, creative, and mobilizing force of human behavior. The so-called spiritual mobilization is to concentrate our comprehensive, integrated, creative, and mobilizing forces to work towards the three common goals of national supremacy, national supremacy, military affairs first, and victory first and to concentrate our will and concentrate our strength to complete the sacred task of resisting aggression and building the country. First of all, we must understand the necessity of resisting aggression and building the country. We cannot deny that for more than two hundred years in the past, our nation has indeed been sluggish. In the past, we have repeatedly suffered from foreign aggression, ceded land and paid indemnities, and lost our sovereignty, and we have almost not become a country. However, we still live in a perfunctory and opportunistic manner and do not strive for governance, so that the aggressors take advantage of the opportunity to invade and trample on our country's territory. Since the sleeping lion of East Asia roared angrily at Lugou Bridge, after more than twenty-one months of resistance war experience, we deeply know that only resistance can maintain the independence, freedom, and peace of the Chinese nation. Only building the country can consolidate and create the foundation of the difficult Republic of China. At the same time, international events have also fully proved that failing to resist aggression will lead to national subjugation. Compromising with the aggressor is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger and will inevitably suffer its own harm. From this point of view, we should continue to resist aggression and build the country, and there is no doubt about it. Our question is how to concentrate the country's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and strive to fight with the determination to break the cauldron and sink the boat to achieve the final victory. The task of resisting aggression and building the country is originally the duty of every citizen. We, members of the cultural sector, have always been praised by our compatriots as outstanding members of the nation. The responsibility for resisting aggression and building the country is naturally even more important. When the National Spiritual Mobilization is launched, we should swear to abide by the National Covenant and check our own lives. Make all actions able to conform to the Outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization and its implementation measures. We are all staff members of cultural undertakings, that is, promoters of spiritual undertakings. Our brains are the agency for issuing orders for our behavior. Our mouths and pens are our sharp weapons, and our limbs are our tools for mounting our horses to kill the enemy and dismounting to write announcements. From now on, we will dedicate our entire lives to the country and the nation. As for the implementation measures, we have other regulations and will not repeat them. This declaration.</p>
<p>Vocational Sector: Calling for Expanding Anti-Wang</p>
<p>The 21st was the Propaganda Day for the cultural sector in the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. In addition to issuing declarations, various newspapers also published special issues. The press also issued a declaration denouncing traitors, calling on citizens to block the Wang clique's movements. The 22nd was the Propaganda Day for the vocational sector. The Vocational Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association of this city issued a declaration of establishment. Various newspapers also published special issues. The following is a copy: Our country's resistance war is entering a new and more difficult stage. At this stage, as Supreme Leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has indicated, "To defeat the enemy and to succeed in building the country, a large part depends on the spiritual strength of every member of our nation. Moreover, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult, more difficult, and more dangerous our environment will inevitably be. We must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to achieve final success." Therefore, at this critical moment of life and death, success and failure, we must mobilize all the forces of the entire nation to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy to strive for the final victory of the Chinese nation's freedom and liberation. On March 12, the Central Government promulgated the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures, which is the most effective weapon to mobilize the power of the entire nation and attack the enemy's offensive. The people of the whole country, under the leadership of the government and the supreme leader, are actively promoting it. The General Headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal National Spiritual Mobilization Association was established earlier last month, and our Vocational Sector Headquarters also announced its establishment today following all sectors. In Shanghai, National Spiritual Mobilization has its special significance, and the tasks undertaken by the vocational sector are also particularly important. Shanghai is a political and economic center. The aggressors' political conspiracies and economic plunder are particularly severe, and the activities of traitors are extremely rampant. The Wang clique, which used to be based in other places, has recently moved to Shanghai to establish a major base, spreading rumors of peace, carrying out divisive conspiracies, and attempting to buy off corrupt elements in the cultural sector and the industrial and commercial sectors to serve as its followers. In the economic field, the enemy is issuing counterfeit currency, disrupting our financial foundation, controlling industry and commerce, strangling our national industry, and dumping inferior goods to absorb our funds. These are all the actions of the enemy in preparing for the final offensive. Therefore, our vocational sector must not only cooperate with all sectors in Shanghai to respond to the great call of the Supreme Leader's National Spiritual Mobilization, but also more effectively implement it and resolutely implement the important tasks entrusted to us by the government. However, in order to implement this movement thoroughly and completely innovate, we advocate that vocational sector personnel and vocational sector groups, based on the specific conditions and environment of each industry, take the following points as the center, and completely mobilize the entire vocational sector, regardless of upper and lower levels: (1) Launch the anti-Wang anti-traitor movement, improve political vigilance, eliminate all wavering and compromising thoughts, and strictly prevent the actions of all corrupt elements to eliminate the Wang clique and its followers' activities and strengthen our anti-war front. (2) Insist on not cooperating with the Japanese puppets. The financial sector must not use counterfeit money or engage in economic exchanges with the Japanese puppets. The industrial sector must not sell raw materials to the Japanese puppets or jointly establish enterprises with the Japanese puppets. The industrial and commercial sectors must not buy and sell Japanese goods and oppose all control by the Japanese puppets, so that the enemy has no way to seize our money for its use. (3) Mobilize funds, machinery, and talents to go inland to build a general rear area and consolidate the economic barrier. (4) Eliminate bad habits, crack down on speculation, correct the drunken and dreamy life, cultivate the pioneering spirit of the morning, break the selfish and self-interested attempts, and crack down on illegal business cases and speculation. (5) Participate in collective life. All vocational sector personnel who do not participate in the Commercial Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association should participate in the branch organizations of each industry of this association. Companies and stores should be led by managers to ensure that everyone can automatically and actively participate in collective life. (6) Implement savings and donations, quit bad habits, ban luxury and waste, and reduce the standard of living to save money to help victims and dedicate it to the country, and encourage those with assets to ruin their families to relieve the country's difficulties, and earnestly promote various movements that contribute to the country in spirit or material. (7) Concentrate strength and strengthen labor-capital unity. The general staff should strive to produce work in their posts, and the capitalists should also take into account the wartime staff's life and give considerable improvements. The outline says: "Although the promotion of spiritual mobilization originates from the top down, the real effect depends on everyone's mutual supervision and encouragement. In the family, family members and brothers encourage each other, and in the organization and group, each member should work together and learn from each other. In the society, regardless of identity, those who are equal in identity should supervise and encourage each other in the relationship of comrades and compatriots. Even for those with higher status, if there are thoughts, words, and actions that violate the spirit, they should also earnestly persuade them from the standpoint of the country and the nation to promote their reform. Therefore, mobilization is a democratic movement that is both top-down and bottom-up. It is necessary to strengthen the unity of labor and capital to achieve 'concentration of will and concentration of strength' and exert collective power. We believe that if we can grasp the above points and cooperate to do it, spiritual mobilization will definitely be greatly expanded in the vocational sector. We will use this to encourage and compete with people from all walks of life. Recently, the situation of the resistance war has been turning in our favor day by day, and the dawn of victory has already been revealed. But we must not forget Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's indication, 'The closer we get to victory, the more difficult, more difficult, and more dangerous our environment will inevitably be. It is necessary to mobilize the spiritual strength of the people to achieve the final success.' Let us take on this important task, expand spiritual mobilization and become a widespread and in-depth mass movement, mobilize all the spiritual forces of the nation, complete the cause of resisting aggression and building the country, and realize the new China of the Three Principles of the People with national independence, democracy, and people's happiness. This declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Diplomatic and Propaganda War on the Eve of the Great War <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Since Germany and Italy aggressively advanced eastward, and Britain and France formed an anti-aggression front to stop them, the situation in Europe had been tense to the point where a major war was about to break out. However, in the past few days, the arrogance of Germany and Italy seems to have slightly subsided, and what has followed is a diplomatic and propaganda war between the democratic bloc and the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Diplomatic and propaganda warfare is a characteristic of the period before the outbreak of a major war. Interspersing diplomatic and propaganda warfare between periods of military tension and relaxation can further promote the maturation of the motivations for a major war. It can be seen that the easing of the European situation is only a temporary lull and not a fundamental solution. On the European political stage in these few days, two trends can be seen: First, Germany and Italy have temporarily stopped their military offensives and instead are trying to win over the smaller countries of Eastern Europe, vying with Britain and France for leadership in Europe, and strengthening their own forces. Second, Germany and Italy are launching public opinion campaigns, vigorously attacking democratic bloc countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and launching side attacks against the diplomatic sanctions of the democratic bloc countries. Although Britain and France's creation of an anti-aggression front and the concentration of small Eastern European countries have achieved considerable results in the past few weeks, Germany and Italy's recent efforts to win over Yugoslavia and Hungary are also progressing. Yugoslavia has not only held talks with Italy, and although its attitude of guaranteeing Italy is still hesitant and no agreement has been signed by both sides, Germany is still using its seductive tactics, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will also go to Berlin on the 26th. Italy's biggest effort at present is to seek an understanding between Yugoslavia and Hungary, and it is reported that Hungary has expressed its welcome. At present, Yugoslavia's relationship is very important among the small countries of Eastern Europe. Therefore, Germany and Italy are exerting pressure and enticements on Yugoslavia in an effort to force Yugoslavia to submit. The conditions Italy has proposed to guarantee Yugoslavia are: if Yugoslavia can join the Anti-Comintern Pact, reorganize its army to be commanded by Germany and Italy, and sign a commercial agreement with Italy, then Hungary will withdraw its demands on Yugoslavia, and Germany and Italy will also guarantee not to invade Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has given these proposals thoughtful consideration and acceptance. The progress of this situation is, of course, a major blow to the democratic countries of Britain and France. However, at a time when Britain and France have failed to make concrete and specific provisions for their guarantees to the smaller countries of Eastern Europe, and the creation of an anti-aggression front of large and small countries such as Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Greece, and Romania is still slow to progress, and Britain is still opening the door to negotiations with Germany and Italy, it is inevitable that the small countries of Eastern Europe will have such an attitude. The only effective way is to ensure that the guarantees to the small countries of Britain and France are practical, and that the prevention of the violent actions of the aggressor nations of Germany and Italy is more concrete.</p>
<p>The recent reason why the aggressor nations of Germany and Italy have changed their military actions to diplomatic struggles is nothing more than the following four points: First, following the active attitude of Britain and France, the United States put forward a peace plan, expressing opposition to Germany and Italy's aggression; Second, Britain actively wooed the Soviet Union to participate in the anti-aggression front, and the methods proposed by the Soviet Union were more concrete and effective; Third, the United States and the Soviet Union are actively preparing in the Far East to sanction Germany and Italy's accomplices, and enhance the power of Britain and France; Fourth, Germany and Italy do not yet have the strength and determination to launch a war under the active encirclement of anti-aggression countries. The first three conditions are especially important in the efforts of Britain and France. Therefore, if Britain and France want to achieve victory in the diplomatic war, they must promote the more concrete and rapid development of the first three conditions. President Roosevelt's peace proposal has made Germany and Italy's arrogance hesitate. Now the United States has recalled the Pacific Fleet and is considering how to stop the aggressors and help the anti-aggression countries. Therefore, if Britain and France can more actively and sincerely promote this trend, their strength in diplomacy will be further increased. Secondly, the Soviet Union no longer harbors doubts about Britain and France, and has actively proposed expanding the anti-aggression front. If Britain and France can give sincere consideration and acceptance to the Soviet Union's proposal, then the strength of the European anti-aggression front will increase, and British and French diplomacy can win victories at every turn. We hope that the rumored British-Soviet agreement and French-Soviet agreement can be realized as soon as possible, and that British, French, and Soviet military cooperation can also be concretized as soon as possible. In addition, how actively the United States and the Soviet Union prevent aggressors in the Far East to enhance the power of Britain and France depends on the attitude of Britain and France. Today, not only has the strengthening and perfection of the Soviet Far East Army caused concern for Japan, but also the recent recall of the United States Pacific Fleet has caused panic in Japan. Japan recently convened a five-minister meeting to consider this issue.</p>
<p>The development of the international situation is increasingly favorable to Britain and France, but whether the results of its development can truly be favorable to Britain and France still needs to be determined by the actions and efforts of Britain and France.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Flames of War Spread in Southern Guangdong, Shipping Greatly Affected, Transportation Between the Siyi Area, Hong Kong, and Macao Relies Solely on the Sanbu-Macao Route <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Ferry Survey</p>
<p>[Macao Correspondent, Min Ge She] After the fall of Guangzhou, shipping in South China suffered a major blow. With the recent fall of Jiangmen, shipping in South China has entered a state of near collapse. Transportation between Siyi and Hong Kong and Macao currently only has the traffic from Sanbu to Macao that can be maintained. In the past, many ferries to Jiangmen Province, such as the "Minzu," floated dead and motionless on the sea in front of the mountain. The Heng'an Ferry, which used to travel to and from the provincial capital of Zhongshan, is said to have been used as a dormitory for Zhiyong Middle School in Macao. The following vessels are now able to shoulder the responsibility of transportation:</p>
<p>(1) Lianshang - from Sanbu to Qianshan, transferring to Macao.</p>
<p>(2) Lianshang, Limin - joint connection, the former runs the Sanbu section, the latter runs the Macao section, and can dock at the Macao Wharf.</p>
<p>(3) Heji, Da'an - joint connection, the former runs the Sanbu section, the latter runs the Macao section, the Qianshan to Macao section is connected by small boats.</p>
<p>(4) Hengji, Deji - joint connection, the former runs the Sanbu section, the latter runs the Macao section, the Qianshan to Macao section is also connected by small boats.</p>
<p>(5) Wuyang - small electric boat, travels between Sanbu Shawei, and then connects to Macao from Macao.</p>
<p>(6) Da Taibei - same as (5).</p>
<p>(7) Da Xingye - same as (5).</p>
<p>The above ferries can be said to be the current ferries that maintain transportation between Sanbu and Macao.</p>
<p>Business situation</p>
<p>Because of the reduction in ferries and the increase in fares, the profits of these ferries are quite good. Recently, passengers traveling from Sanbu to Macao have been very crowded, while passengers returning to Sanbu from Macao are fewer. As for fares, the ferries are not consistent, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Lianshang (direct) - large cabin 6 yuan, dining floor 8 yuan.</p>
<p>Da'an, Heji (connecting) Large cabin 6 yuan, dining floor 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Lianshang, Limin (connecting) - When leaving Sanbu to Macao, large cabin 4 yuan, dining floor 6 yuan; when returning to Sanbu from Macao, large cabin 3 yuan, dining floor 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Hengji, Deji (connecting) - large cabin 6 yuan, dining floor 8 yuan</p>
<p>Wuyang, Da Taishan, Da Xingye and other electric boats - uniformly 6 yuan 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Except for the Lianshang Ferry, which goes directly to Sanbu Macao, the rest pass through the narrow Xiaoyongdao of Fanyu Sha, where it is quite a hardship to be connected by a small boat for two hours at night. Passengers should try to take the direct one (Lianshang Ferry).</p>
<p>Journey Past and Present</p>
<p>In the past, the waterway was open and unobstructed, and it only took 11 hours from Macao to Sanbu. Now, because one part has fallen into the sphere of influence of the bandits, and another part belongs to our army's sealing line, we have to detour through Xiaoyong. For example, in the past, we entered Zhuzhou through Muzhoukou, entered Menjiao, passed Jianchong, and went straight to Denglongshanzui, turned to Zhumuzui and reached Qianshan Macao. Now, after passing Muzhoukou, we have to pass a bow shape through Beihe and enter Quan Zhonggang into Jianchong. After reaching Jianchong, we cannot pass Dengzui, and enter Qianshan Jiangmen in an arc shape. The minimum time required is 15 hours. If the water is shallow, the time is uncertain.</p>
<p>Armed Self-Defense</p>
<p>Following the bandit intrusions, piracy has also become rampant. Recently, cases of ship robberies have been seen everywhere. Therefore, except for a few small electric boats, the rest are all protected by armed forces. Robberies usually occur in the following two places: (1) In Fanyu Sha, because the river channel here is very narrow and quite long, it is easiest for bandits to rob. (2) At Hukengkou, because the river channel there is narrow and relatively remote. But now the armed forces of the ferries are quite substantial and can defeat bandits, so even if they encounter bandits, there is no great danger.</p>
<p>Worth noting</p>
<p>There are currently two issues that deserve our attention: First, prevent the bandits from entering again. If a bandit ship breaks through the blockade line and parks one or two bandit ships near Yinzhuhuo, then this only traffic artery will be cut off. Second, vessels often run aground in Xiaoyong. For convenience and statistics, these Xiaoyong should be dredged. (Lin Ling)</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Circumstances of the Eurasia Airlines No. 23 Accident in Guizhou, A Detailed Account by Pilot He of What Happened at the Time, The Sudden Change in Mountain Climate Caused the Tragedy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Local News] On March 12, the Eurasia Airlines No. 23 aircraft crashed in Guizhou, with two male and two female passengers and one telegraph operator on board, all of whom died from their injuries. The plane was also burned. Pilot He Shouying and He Qizhao (formerly mistakenly reported as He Qiming), although seriously injured, were fortunately rescued. After coming to Hong Kong to be treated in a certain hospital, they have gradually recovered. The reporter visited the hospital yesterday and Mr. He Qizhao recounted the ordeal he encountered at the time. On the 12th, aircraft No. 23 flew from Chongqing to Kunming. On the way, the weather suddenly turned bad, and the entire aircraft was trapped in a hazy atmosphere. From the driver's seat, the airman could not see the aircraft's form, showing how heavy the fog was. At that time, in order to escape the heavy fog, they were forced to fly low, descending from 3,000 feet to 2,000 feet. Unexpectedly, due to a sudden change in air pressure, the middle engine was damaged, leaving only the left and right engines, which were no longer easy to use. Although the fog at low altitude was thinner, it was still impossible to see the way ahead, so they had to rely on instruments to make blind flights. Guiyang is mostly mountainous, and there are often towering mountains obstructing the way. After several times of avoiding danger, they unexpectedly encountered a cliff ahead at the last moment, only a few dozen feet away, and they just noticed it. In a hurry, there was no way to turn, and it was impossible to rise higher. At that time, they were in a dilemma, and they had no choice but to fly obliquely into a mountain depression and choose a relatively flat slope to make a forced landing. When landing, the aircraft body swayed, and he and his colleague Shouying were thrown out of the aircraft. The aircraft body was not seriously damaged, but unfortunately the fuel tank caught fire upon touching the ground, causing it to be burned. The passengers and the telegraph operator all died in the crash. After being thrown away, he and Mr. Shouying were unconscious for a long time. When they woke up, they knew everything. Shouying had broken more than half of his teeth and injured his foot. He was splashed with burning liquid all over, and his face was scorched. The reason he did not die was probably because he was thrown farther away. Afterwards, the two helped each other down the mountain and arrived at the plain two days later, where they were rescued by the villagers. Last time, I was attacked by several bandit aircraft on aircraft No. 17 and was finally able to escape. I originally thought myself lucky, but unexpectedly this time I was blocked by the climate and could not escape, causing a major loss. I feel very regretful, etc. During He's speech, he was quite self-effacing. The reporter gave him comfort. According to the investigation, the five people who died in the crash of aircraft No. 23 were all insured by the airline, with compensation of 10,000 marks per person, equivalent to 20,000 yuan in national currency. Both He were graduates of the 4th flying class of the Guangdong Aviation School. He Qizhao also studied mechanics and served in the Air Force for a long time, with outstanding skills. When aircraft No. 17 was attacked by bandit aircraft, he was the driver and escaped, so he was highly praised. He Shouying only treated his teeth, so he did not enter the hospital. He Qizhao is also gradually recovering and will be able to continue his service after recuperating.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Shanghai News, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession sent personnel to the French General Police Station this morning to request the return of the confiscated national flags. The police station refused to return them on the grounds that they had not yet received an order from the French Consul. Therefore, the association requested Hua Wei Qu Zhenhua to negotiate with the French Consulate General this morning. He was met by Deputy Consul Broyan, who replied that the French authorities had decided to return the confiscated national flags in the same way as before. However, this afternoon, it was feared that the procedures would be too late, but Broyan assured Qu that the confiscated national flags would be returned to the Taxpayers Association no later than noon tomorrow. According to the English-language "Continental Daily," leaflets were distributed in the Great World area on the 23rd, expressing opposition to the French Concession authorities' interference in the resolution of the flag hanging case, with extremely strong wording.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Announcement by the Military Affairs Commission: Outline for Propaganda in Guerrilla Areas, Mobilizing Battlefield Civilians to Launch Resistance Battles <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The Military Affairs Commission has recently issued the following outline for propaganda in the battle areas (i.e., guerrilla areas):</p>
<p>The Necessity of Warfare</p>
<p>In the second phase of the War of Resistance, political propaganda work in the battle areas is more important than both at the front lines and in the rear, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) In the vast territories "**occupied**" by the enemy, the enemy can only effectively occupy a few urban strongholds. The rest of the territory is under our control and governance. (According to the statistics of the Executive Yuan on county administration in the battle areas in February of this year: (A) Among the 941 counties in the war zones of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Fujian, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, county magistrates were unable to exercise their powers in only 55 counties; (B) County magistrates in 25 counties where part of the county was occupied still resided in the county seat and exercised their powers; (C) County magistrates in 245 counties where the county seat had fallen relocated to the countryside to work; (D) County magistrates in 23 counties relocated to neighboring counties but were still able to exercise their powers.) We have already established many anti-Japanese bases in these vast areas, left many regular troops, and organized many guerrilla units, whose range of activities extends from six or seven counties to dozens of counties. Therefore, the Minister instructed that all Party and government personnel and revolutionary cadres in the rear of the enemy should remain there. At the same time, the whole country, from top to bottom, should regard the enemy's rear as an important area for our revolutionary work.</p>
<p>(2) The enemy's strategy of military aggression is to use military means to achieve its economic plunder, and to use political means to conceal the facts of its military aggression. The enemy everywhere instigates traitors to establish puppet organizations, and at the same time uses traitors to create various bandit companies, using the name of developing industries to carry out its actual plunder. This is the concrete manifestation of this conspiracy. In response to this conspiracy of the enemy, we must use military cover to launch political offensives, and use politics to assist in military victories. Implementing this countermeasure requires political propaganda work in the battle areas to assume even greater tasks.</p>
<p>(3) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy's strategy of "**quick victory**" and its policy of "**quick peace**" have both failed, and they are caught in a dilemma, unable to stop. Their forces are insufficient, and their finances are exhausted. They have to issue the sound of a "long-term war" and the slogan of "long-term construction." The so-called "long-term construction" is actually "long-term war," which is an attempt to use the manpower and resources of our battle areas to promote further aggression against China's capital. According to recent intelligence, the enemy is stepping up its assistance to the puppet "New China Government": (1) Consolidating the occupied areas and actively reorganizing the resources of the occupied areas, at a minimum, they must find ways to supply the needs of the enemy's expeditionary army in China; (2) Extensively reclaiming and cultivating land in the occupied areas, moving its nationals to cultivate the land; (3 code illegible). To strike at the enemy's illusion, we must first ensure that the enemy cannot plunder resources or organize puppet troops in the battle areas. This task largely falls on the shoulders of political workers in the battle areas. We must extensively and deeply penetrate the rear of the enemy, launch guerrilla warfare, consolidate revolutionary regimes in various places, destroy the enemy's transportation, and obstruct all political, economic, and cultural facilities of the enemy, so that the enemy is exhausted and surrounded and attacked by our revolutionary forces, leading to its complete collapse (Minister Chen's words).</p>
<p>(4) The characteristic of the second phase of the War of Resistance is the transition from defense to offense, from defeat to victory. On the one hand, we must prevent the enemy from attacking, and on the other hand, we must prepare more troops so that they are powerless and dare not boldly attack. At the same time, we must prepare more experienced troops in the rear of the enemy, unite the people with greater resistance, so that they can be used to attack the enemy from both sides and cut off the enemy's retreat during the general counter-offensive.</p>
<p>(5) The battle areas are located behind the enemy, and can be threatened and attacked by the enemy at any time. It is often difficult to obtain supplies from our rear. Therefore, we must step up political propaganda work to raise the national consciousness and spirit of sacrifice of the troops and people in the battle areas. We must "infinitely increase the importance of political work" in order to accomplish this sacred and great task.</p>
<p>Tasks and Targets of the Work</p>
<p>(1) According to the instructions of the Minister in the discussion and resolution on the future work of the Political Department, to sum up, the tasks of political propaganda work in the battle areas are: (A) to launch and expand guerrilla warfare; (B) to establish and consolidate our revolutionary regime; (C) to more strongly organize the people in the rear of the enemy, and to compete with the enemy for the people; (D) to eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake the enemy troops; (E) to destroy the enemy's transportation and obstruct all political, economic, and cultural facilities of the enemy, so that the enemy is exhausted and surrounded and attacked by our vast revolutionary forces, leading to its collapse.</p>
<p>(2) Therefore, the targets of political propaganda work in the battle areas can be mainly divided into the following four types: (A) officers and soldiers of formal troops and guerrilla fighters; (B) enemy and puppet civilians; (C) enemy and puppet officers and soldiers; (D) prisoners of war. The supreme leader, in his instruction at the senior political work conference, gave a keen indication of the meaning of political work and its scope of education, saying, "Political workers are political educators between the army and the people, making them understand political implementation policies." He also said, "The scope of education is not limited to the troops and their members, but wherever the army is stationed, its surrounding environment should take the army as a model and generate the function of educating the people." In the political propaganda work of the troops, naturally the first target is the officers and soldiers of the troops. We must help the training of the troops, improve discipline, boost morale, assist the wounded and sick, and prevent desertion. Second, joining the army as soldiers and returning to the people after retiring, the military and the people are originally one. In the war behind the enemy, it is especially necessary to obtain the support and support of the people. The leader's instruction pointed out that the army must become a model for the people, "generating the function of educating the people." At the same time, the Minister instructed, "Military-civilian cooperation is the only element for our victory over the enemy. In the rear of the enemy, we must compete with the enemy for the people, so the discipline of the troops is the highest requirement of the War of Resistance." Therefore, the political propaganda work for the people in the rear of the enemy must be effectively responsible by the political workers of the troops. It is best to ensure that every soldier can become a propagandist and educator of the people. Third, the battle area is the rear of the enemy, and there is frequent contact with the enemy. Not only is there an urgent need to eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake the enemy troops in combat, but also in terms of propaganda techniques, there is the convenience of deepening and expanding our propaganda to the enemy and puppets. Therefore, enemy and puppet officers and soldiers are also important targets of political propaganda work in the battle areas. As for the official propaganda to the prisoners of war, if it is done well, it will be of great help to our propaganda to the enemy. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Miscellaneous Feelings on Escaping Bombings in Chongqing <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Sui</p>
<p>Travels in Xinjiang, Part 3</p>
<p>I arrived in Yu on March 19th. Since Chongqing was bombed by enemy planes on January 15th, there has been no recurrence. Although the Chongqing authorities have been vigorously advocating the evacuation of the population, the citizens are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not taken effective evacuation measures, as I mentioned in my second communication. Unexpectedly, an air raid alarm suddenly came at 9:15 p.m. on the 28th. At that time, I was attending a banquet hosted by my colleague, Mr. Ni Er, at the Fenjiang Restaurant in Huixian Bridge. After several rounds of wine, just as we were about to start eating, the sound of footsteps suddenly arose upstairs and downstairs. The host inquired and learned that it was an air raid alarm. The host and guests all left their seats and went downstairs. I asked the host where the nearest air raid shelter was so that we could go and take shelter temporarily. Mr. Luo, who was sitting on the right, immediately took my hand and went downstairs. He learned that he lived in the Bank of Communications, and that the bank's basement was quite solid and could be used as a shelter. We immediately left the restaurant and headed towards our destination. We saw vehicles blocking the road and the order was chaotic. Beside the sidewalk was a newly built water pool, with a rectangular hole every few feet, making it very inconvenient to walk. We were clear-headed and walked and talked, and arrived at the bank's entrance in about ten minutes. We entered through a side door. Inside, we saw women and children gathered, all entering the basement one after another. We followed them in. The basement was originally a tunnel for the bank's vault, with ventilation on both sides. It was about four or five feet wide and had long benches. We sat on the benches. At 9:45, an emergency alarm was issued, and the lights were immediately extinguished. We closed our eyes and sat quietly, thoughts rising and falling. Looking back on it afterward, it was quite valuable to record. At 10:05, the alarm was lifted, and we followed the crowd out of the basement. Mr. Luo and I went upstairs to chat, and I said goodbye and returned to my residence at 11:00.</p>
<p>In the basement, after the emergency alarm was issued, I had many thoughts in the dark: First, it was my personal view of life and death. I believe that life inevitably leads to death, and no one can avoid the coming of death, but one must die in the right way, at the right time, and in the right place. Therefore, when one should die, there is no need to fear death. Conversely, when one should not die, one should not easily give up life. Therefore, when the enemy comes to bomb, we should make our best efforts to resist actively and passively, to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and to weaken the manpower and resources for war. Second, I felt that Chongqing has a population of 500,000 to 600,000, and all the air raid shelters can accommodate at most 100,000 people. There are still 400,000 to 500,000 people who must be evacuated. Speaking of evacuation, I thought of the lack of general transportation. How will hundreds of thousands of people be moved out of the city? Also, the poor security in the countryside. Once dispersed to the countryside, will outsiders be allowed to live in peace? These points are worth discussing. Third, are air raid shelters reliable after all? As last time in Xi'an, when a meeting was being held, they suddenly encountered an air raid. One of the two entrances of the air raid shelter where they were taking shelter was hit by an explosive bomb, and the other was hit by an incendiary bomb. As a result, one entrance was blocked by the explosion, and the other was rushed in by smoke and flames, so that most of the people in the shelter suffocated to death. Although Chongqing has many stone mountains, I heard that the stone is very loose and easily cracked by tremors. If the trenches are dug too large, or the rock is particularly loose, it is easy to "rest in peace." Fourth, the people in Chongqing who are escaping air raids are confident that there is a fixed time, roughly from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. as the time for escaping attacks. Therefore, women and children go to the south bank during this time, and schools and banks are required not to operate within this time. But is it true that the enemy cannot attack in the afternoon or even at night? Fifth, many citizens, in addition to the poor security in the countryside as a reason, also cite the lack of tap water, electric lights, telephones, and modern transportation in the countryside as reasons for not being able to evacuate easily. If every village were the same as the city, would it be possible to avoid the danger of air raids?</p>
<p>The next morning, I saw in the newspapers: "Air raid alarm at 9:10 last night," followed by another headline: "Evacuate the population, without delay." It was clearly notified to the readers that last night's alarm was just a drill. By coincidence, at 11:50 a.m. on the 29th, a real alarm did come. That time, my colleague Mr. Zhang and I were walking on the road, preparing to go to a friend's banquet, when we suddenly heard the alarm. We went to the nearby Bank of China to take shelter temporarily, but the basement was already full and the air was turbid. We chatted in the reception room, preparing to go down again when the emergency alarm sounded. As a result, the alarm was lifted, and we left immediately. The next day's newspaper reported: "Yesterday, 36 enemy planes attacked in two batches. Because our planes fought back, they only dropped bombs in Liangshan and fled." After these two lessons, I don't know whether the citizens' psychology will be able to find a smoother solution to the issue of population evacuation.</p>
<p>After being frightened by the two alarms, I, who am sensitive, have the following kinds of illusions appearing in my mind when I go out: First, walking on Doyou Street, I only see a crowd of people, and I feel very sad when I think of the illusion of death and corpses piled up during the coming catastrophe in the future; second, seeing the dense buildings in the city and the poor materials, I have the illusion of a citywide fire after an incendiary bomb is dropped; third, seeing modern women revealing their snow-white arms and jade legs, I also have an illusion of bloody flesh; fourth, when I come across lively and lovely little babies, I suddenly see an illusion of a pale baby corpse. The newspaper reported that someone in Beipei received a night raid alarm and fell into a cave and died; in the city, there were various news of fights and injuries due to disputes over air raid shelters. I am sweating for the citizens of Chongqing. Doesn't everyone have parents, brothers, and wives? Who doesn't cherish their own and their family's lives? Except for those who cannot leave due to their jobs, why not evacuate and move their families to the countryside early? To carry out the War of Resistance to the end, the most important manpower and resources all depend on the support of the people in the rear. If one sacrifices one's life in vain, it is letting the country down, and it is no different from soldiers deserting. The citizens should be aware of it!</p>

<h3 id="e14">Britain Resists Aggression, Issues Warning to Germany, Delivered to German Foreign Minister by Henderson, Requests Acceptance of US Peace Proposal <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 24th) The British authorities have recently sent a "straightforward note" to Hitler. According to a spokesman today, it actually includes the meaning of protest and warning. If Germany continues to create a tense situation, Britain will be forced to take national conscription measures. The spokesman also confirmed that the British ambassador to Germany, who was returning to Germany from Britain, carried this note with him. Its contents include: (1) Britain reiterated its belief that European problems must be resolved peacefully; (2) President Roosevelt's proposal is the best opportunity to enable Germany to negotiate with Britain; (3) Britain is determined to resist attempts to monopolize Europe by force.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 24th) The British Prime Minister today, in response to an inquiry from opposition leader Attlee in the House of Commons, said that the return of the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, to Berlin had no particular significance. Ambassador Henderson was summoned to the country to report to the government authorities. After completing the report, the government authorities gave him a short holiday. After the holiday was over, he left Britain and returned to Germany to resume his duties as usual. Attlee also asked whether Ambassador Henderson's return to Germany meant that the British government had recognized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain replied, "Absolutely not."</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 25th) The British Ambassador, Henderson, will visit the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today. According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, Henderson will take the opportunity to explain some key points of British policy, including resisting future aggression. At the same time, Henderson will also clearly state that Britain has no intention of encircling Germany, and still maintains a policy of peace. However, the dangers caused by recent events must be stopped.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Berlin, 25th) The British Ambassador, Henderson, is scheduled to go to the Foreign Ministry between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to deliver Chamberlain's note. It is generally believed that the note will be handed over directly to Ribbentrop by Henderson. Although there is much speculation about the content of the note, the exact content is still unknown. Political figures observe that Germany will inevitably not be pleased with this note, especially if the note indicates that Britain has decided, or will decide, to adopt a conscription system. There is little hope of easing Hitler's speech with this note. Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain abandoned his appeasement policy and adopted a tough attitude, which has long made Hitler resentful.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 25th) According to news from diplomatic correspondents of various newspapers this morning, the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, will relay a clear warning from the British government to Hitler on this return to duty. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that Henderson will express that unless Germany has clear evidence of changing its policies, the British government will have no choice but to continue to organize an anti-aggression front and implement conscription. Henderson will suggest that Germany should withdraw its volunteers stationed in the west and quickly demobilize a portion of its mobilized troops. Germany will understand the British government's desire to obtain practical and peaceful methods to resolve all counties and demands through international cooperation. Therefore, the British government expresses its faithful support for President Roosevelt's telegrams to Hitler and Mussolini. This fact has been clearly stated in the British note to the United States. The "Daily Express," while confirming the news that Henderson will request an immediate meeting with Hitler on this return to duty, also firmly believes that Henderson will persuade Hitler to accept President Roosevelt's proposed ten- to twenty-five-year peace plan. The newspaper also said: "The government's frank words will include a clear warning that if Germany rejects President Roosevelt's proposal, the result will inevitably increase the tension of the international situation and only make the world, especially British public opinion, have the worst impression of Germany." The "Daily Mail" made a more powerful expression of the last point, saying that Henderson will make every effort to show that if Germany rejects President Roosevelt's proposal, it will increase the tension of the international situation to the point of rupture.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 25th) Member of Parliament and diplomatic correspondent of the "News Chronicle," Butler, made cautious remarks regarding the report that Britain had issued a warning to Hitler, saying, "Regarding this warning, it seems that no one can know what kind of negotiations can be held between the two sides. I have received assurances that within a few hours, the whole world will know for sure that this step shows that the British government's attitude of resisting aggression has not weakened in the slightest." The "News Chronicle" paid close attention to the rumor that the cabinet has agreed on the necessity of conscription. The newspaper's political correspondent said, "At least one minister who discussed the conscription issue with me has pointed out that conscripting 19-year-old youths into the army can increase the local army by 300,000 people." In addition, the diplomatic correspondent of "The Times," after mentioning the return of the British Ambassador to Germany and Chamberlain's simple statement on this matter in the House of Commons, said, "In short, Ambassador Henderson's trip to Germany and his return to duty did not indicate that there was any change in the government's policy, and certainly not a weakening of the government's policy. This point can be shown both domestically and in the talks with foreign capitals in the past few weeks." British officials have not made a clear disclosure of the instructions sent to Ambassador Henderson to be conveyed to Hitler, but it seems certain that the British government has given certain instructions to the German ambassador.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th) The German Ambassador to Britain, Dirksey, will return to his post within days.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Paris, 24th) It is reported that the French Ambassador to Germany left here tonight to go to Berlin.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Paris, 24th) It has just been announced by authoritative sources that France will follow Britain and order its ambassador to Germany to return to his post before Hitler's speech on Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Britain Closely Monitors the Situation in Spain, Gibraltar's Number One Dock Works Day and Night to Complete it Soon <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 24th) Undersecretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons on the same day that, according to information obtained by the government, the recent activities of Spanish troops near Gibraltar were a natural phenomenon of troop demobilization. A member asked, "Since increasing the number of reinforcements to Gibraltar is not important, why bother doing so?" Butler did not answer. When asked about the issue of expanding Gibraltar's Number One Dock, Colonel Lewin of the Admiralty replied that the work is now being carried out day and night, and the authorities have done everything possible to ensure that the project is completed as soon as possible. The Undersecretary also replied to a question about maintaining the status quo of the Tangier International Zone, saying that the government believes that maintaining the status quo there is of utmost importance. When asked whether the government protested against the Italian government's continued stationing of a large number of troops in Spain after the cessation of the Spanish war, Chamberlain replied that the government did not consider it necessary to protest. In addition, there were questions raised that, fearing that the Italian army would not withdraw from Spain after Franco's victory parade on May 15, the Prime Minister declared that the government was closely monitoring the situation there.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Puyo, 24th) Regarding rumors that the Spanish National Army government intends to occupy the international neutral port of Tangier, the Foreign Ministry recently issued a statement firmly denying it.</p>
<p>The Deposed King of Spain Awaits His Return</p>
<p>(Rome, 24th) According to foreign news, the deposed King Alfonso of Spain is still living in the Hotel Rome, awaiting a call from Franco inviting him to return home. At the same time, Alfonso and his queen have also completely reconciled and will soon issue a formal statement clarifying the fact that the two have reunited. The deposed king's secretary announced today, "There is nothing to announce at the moment. King Alfonso is currently paying attention to the developments in Spain. However, when Madrid fell, the deposed king sent a telegram to General Franco, and Franco replied, expressing his heartfelt congratulations." Since the Franco government recently issued an order to return the deposed king's property, the talk of restoration has been noisy. It is reported that the deposed king was forced to leave the country eight years ago, and his queen, Irene, is the granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England. They once had disagreements and wanted to divorce, but they have now reconciled and are staying in Rome together.</p>

It is understood that the Romanian Minister of Economy has replied that Romania cannot accept the two plans in their current form, as the basic principle of the German-Romanian trade agreement is the "economic exchange" between the two countries, rather than providing products to Romania for consumption.</p>

The Foreign Minister declared that he had no prior knowledge of Roosevelt's message and stated that the Norwegian government did not feel threatened, but would be harmed if war broke out. Therefore, preparations are now being made to increase national defense capabilities.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 25th] The new Belgian government held its first cabinet meeting today and will put forward demands for special powers. The newspaper "Le Soir" here stated that the government wants to ensure economic and financial recovery and believes that special powers must be obtained.

<h3 id="e32">Secretary of State Hull Issues Statement on Attitude Towards Germany; US Will Not Send Ambassador Back to Germany; Rumor of Hitler Planning to Offer Counter-Proposals <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today, saying that although Britain has decided to instruct Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, to return to his post, the United States has no intention of following suit. Official sources believe that President Roosevelt will not make any decisions about reappointing an ambassador until Hitler formally responds to his message. Information received here from the press and diplomatic circles indicates that Hitler will put forward counter-proposals to President Roosevelt's proposals, insisting that Germany's economic and colonial demands must be met first before offering guarantees. It is also rumored that Hitler may seek to restore a policy of reconciliation and designate Mr. Roosevelt's message as an expression of a policy of reconciliation. However, political circles are well aware that President Roosevelt is unwilling to fall into his trap, especially as the strongest opponents of the policy of appeasement are precisely the people within the Roosevelt faction. At the same time, due to domestic policy reasons, the President cannot strongly urge Britain and France to take steps to satisfy the desires of the Axis powers. When the policy of appeasement existed, the press here, encouraged by official sources, expressed that the United States could hardly ignore a proposal to cede West Africa, as it would directly affect South America. Some African groups, fearing the danger of falling under Axis rule, have launched appeals for American protection, such as the US interests in Liberia and local demands for American protection against the Nuremberg racial laws. Therefore, the US government has not formally expressed its withdrawal from all territorial disputes, but in reality, there is a considerable amount of land which, if it becomes the target of negotiations, would make the US government feel uneasy. Therefore, it is generally predicted that Washington may provide a clear explanation in principle regarding the President's suggestions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] According to authoritative sources here, whether the United States will send an ambassador back to Germany will depend on Hitler's response to Roosevelt's suggestions. As to how Hitler's speech would be satisfactory to American readers, it is still difficult to predict. Members of the Foreign Relations Committee also declined to comment, but it is known that even if US-German relations are restored, Mr. Wilson will be reassigned, and another ambassador will be sent to Berlin to replace him.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Belgrade, 25th] After returning from Venice, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković visited Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković to report on the results of his meeting with the Italian Foreign Minister in Venice, and to discuss various issues related to the Yugoslav Foreign Minister's visit to Berlin, which commenced this morning.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Belgrade, 25th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković met with reporters yesterday and stated that the most important issues between Italy and Yugoslavia are the basic principles established in foreign policy. Following the Venice conference, all relevant issues between the two countries have been satisfactorily resolved, and the friendly relations between the two sides have become more solid. He also said that the outcome of the Venice conference can be considered very satisfactory.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th] The well-known German newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter" stated that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will visit Hungary next month. It is expected that a non-aggression pact between Yugoslavia and Hungary will be signed at that time, as Hungary was reportedly willing to sign such a pact in Venice, and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister also expressed his agreement.

<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The "Times" correspondent in Berlin reported that there is no official information regarding Germany and Japan negotiating to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance.

<h3 id="e35">The Mulan of Hong Kong <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The historical Hua Mulan of China, whose fragrance has lasted for thousands of years and whose reputation is renowned at home and abroad, has brought much honor to the world of women.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, women from all over the country have enthusiastically participated, from war service groups to military service groups, as well as civilian corps and self-defense corps assisting in maintaining order in the rear. There are even female student soldiers participating in the frontline war. The great spirit of these women, who are determined to serve the country and sacrifice for the nation, is not only comparable to the ancient Hua Mulan, but also has a more significant meaning, that is, they use their own struggles to raise their political and social status and open up a path of liberation for women. It is not just about creating a few female heroes through occasional legends, but about the permanent and thorough liberation of the vast majority of women.</p>
<p>However, women in Hong Kong have always been looked down upon. They are regarded as toys or appendages of men, they are forced to become commodities, and they become pests of society and brokers of sin. This is the shame of women in Hong Kong and of all Chinese women. This shame has not been cleansed since the War of Resistance, and with the arrival of "high-class refugees" and "poor refugees", this shame is even more seriously threatening our female compatriots!</p>
<p>Social leaders and enlightened women must feel a great sense of responsibility for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, the "Mulan of Hong Kong" has repeatedly appeared recently. They do not have the social leaders' backing of actors and stars, nor do they have newspapers publishing their "glamor shots" for widespread publicity. They silently and resolutely break away from coddling and say goodbye to comfortable nests to return to the motherland, return to their hometowns, to serve the soldiers, and even to take up arms to defend the country! They have no desire for glory or profit, and even if they are wounded in battle, no one will treat them. Even if they fight to the death, no one will know! However, they have promoted the noble morality and great spirit of the Chinese nation. Their spirit of not seeking recognition and vowing to fight to the death will wash away the shame of the women's world and raise the social and political status of women!</p>
<p>The military service group of the Guangzhou YMCA held a flag-giving ceremony at the Hong Kong YMCA yesterday. The group, consisting of fourteen people, will go to the Shaoguan front line to serve within days. We cannot describe the greatness of this group of new Mulan of Hong Kong, even with all the glorious and beautiful words! They are all young women, and they all have the youth that most people envy, but they have broken away from coddling, studies, and careers, and embarked on a path of hard work and service. They are not for fame, not for profit, and there is no temptation. What power can force people to abandon coddling and comfort and go to sacrifice and struggle? In addition to praising their will and bravery, can we not be excited and encouraged for the victorious future of the Chinese nation?</p>
<p>Female compatriots who are deceived by love and pleasure, are you not ashamed? Female compatriots who are groaning in pain, darkness, bullying, and insult, are you not moved? Wake up from the mirror-like love and comfort, wake up from pain and darkness. The road to self-help, the torch of light, and the banner of victory are already in front of you!</p>
<h3 id="e36">Britain to Implement Conscription; Cabinet Meeting Already Discussed; Formal Decree to Be Issued Immediately; Churchill Says the Government and Opposition Unanimously Support It <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] The British Cabinet held a meeting this evening at the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons for two hours and fifteen minutes to discuss compulsory military service. It is generally believed that nationals aged 19 to 25 will be conscripted. This issue will be discussed again at the regular meeting on Wednesday, and a formal decree will be issued before the end of the week. The "Daily Herald" and "News Chronicle" reported that the Cabinet has decided to approve the principle of compulsory military service and that nationals aged 18 to 20 will be conscripted first. The formal decision will depend on the content of Hitler's speech on the 28th. The "News Chronicle" also stated that a cabinet member said that conscripting 19-year-olds would add 500,000 to the territorial army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 25th] Churchill, a leader of the extreme right wing of the Conservative Party, gave a speech at the Munchin Club yesterday, hinting at the implementation of compulsory military service. He said that the British territorial army has been actively expanding and is on par with wartime staffing levels. The work of building the country's defenses for the second time is also progressing smoothly. Such achievements are indeed rare. The government has previously provided guarantees to various European countries, stating that if any of those countries are invaded, Britain will do its utmost to jointly resist. On this point, the government and opposition across the country have unanimously expressed their support. However, to date, Britain has not taken appropriate steps to strengthen its army and support its promises. It is hoped that the government will implement compulsory military service, regardless of the specific format. In general, Britain will soon implement compulsory military service.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Japan's Spiritual Mobilization <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— An Excerpt</p>
<p>Ginza is Tokyo's Piccadilly Circus, a bustling street with all kinds of neon lights dazzling on the streets.</p>
<p>But now there is no such scene anymore. Tokyo has become a series of gloomy, desolate, and dim streets. When a tourist treads on the uneven and winding road, the first question is "Is Tokyo preparing for an air raid?"</p>
<p>When he learns that air raids are limited to Chinese cities, he will undoubtedly suspect that perhaps Tokyo is under the threat of war and is trying to conserve its electricity supply. But he is wrong again.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, everything in Japan is placed under a strict system of economic control and restrictions. But abolishing neon lights and many similar things has little to do with normal economics, because electricity is Japan's cheapest product.</p>
<p>The reason why they make everyday life so bleak is simply to make the people on the 'rear front' as much as possible experience the suffering of the soldiers on the battlefield. This is called spiritual mobilization.</p>
<p>Those who participate in spiritual mobilization have already formed a very powerful group here. At the same time, since they have taken the Rising Sun flag as their symbol and the so-called "Japanese spirit" as their foundation,</p>
<p>All kinds of inexplicable plans have become national policies.</p>
<p>From a certain point of view, this spiritual mobilization may represent a little bit of the characteristics of the Japanese people - that is, the docile nature of rejoicing when others are happy and grieving when others are sad. Asking them to sacrifice these luxurious pleasures and give up some habits of enjoyment to show sympathy for the soldiers on the front line is very likely to move them.</p>
<p>But the spiritual mobilizers have pushed this very natural feeling to the most ridiculous extreme. Due to excessive efforts to save, it has caused serious threats to people's lives. Here, a major economic problem is how to achieve a balance of international trade without causing too many unemployed people. For example, the strict restrictions on the import of cotton and wood will inevitably lead to a large number of unemployed people in the textile industry.</p>
<p>The climax of spiritual mobilization has also created excessive excitement in some people. They demand that people no longer build new houses, wear new clothes, attend social gatherings, abolish commonly used ribbons and ties, and all human comforts, enjoyments, and entertainments, even all necessities are abandoned, regardless of whether it will cause a large number of people to suffer unemployment.</p>
<p>But when they were almost reaching the point where the government would prohibit department stores, cinemas, restaurants, and other public places from installing air conditioning equipment, they could no longer use their skills.</p>
<p>A restaurant owner once said that without air conditioning, his exquisite underground restaurant would have to close its doors, and this mere two and a half cents a day expense was maintaining the jobs of about fifty people.</p>
<p>But the spiritual mobilizers got another string on their bow. Their main justification is to create a fiercely hot atmosphere. They say that their soldiers on the front line are fainting under the scorching heat of 110 to 120 degrees. Why shouldn't we be like this? This kind of justification is almost convincing. Few passionate officials are willing to say that they want to make the minds of the people in the rear cooler than the soldiers on the front line.</p>
<p>The most prominent feature of spiritual mobilization is the attack on all enjoyments, luxuries, entertainments, and banquets that are somewhat Western in nature. Now in Japan, going to dance halls, organizing dances, and dancing are practically criminal acts. Even foreigners, even diplomatic personnel, are not allowed to hold dances.</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that, with their passionate minds, they feel that it is absolutely impossible for young men and women to dance together without leading to chaos.</p>
<p>They do not pay attention to what is generally considered moral. They are just anti-Western, and their stubborn xenophobia is even worse than that of the ignorant Chinese Boxers. (Translated from London's "Northern Communication")</p>

<h3 id="e38">Coping with Extraordinary Times: The Hong Kong Government Urges Residents to Stockpile One Month's Worth of Food <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Recently, residents have been specifically advised to stockpile one month's worth of food to prepare for emergencies. The authorities' aim is to prevent merchants from exploiting opportunities to monopolize and raise prices for profit, thereby increasing the burden on citizens. The authorities, mindful of the impact of the European situation on Hong Kong last November, which led to the disruption of various food and canned goods supplies, coupled with Hong Kong's limited inventory, caused merchants to seize the opportunity to monopolize and inflate prices to an abnormal extent. Relief arrived later with shipments from the Philippines, and as the European crisis eased, the situation gradually returned to normal. As for food storage, canned goods that are easy to preserve are best, and the longer the storage time, the better. However, excessive storage may not be feasible, so one month is the limit. Stored food should be replaced with fresh items regularly, using the older ones first to maintain the freshness of the reserves.</p>
<p>Stockpiling for One Month in Preparation for Emergencies</p>
<p>The authorities have also referenced the living habits of Europeans and provided a table detailing the monthly needs of a two-person household, as follows: 28 plates of breakfast food, 28 plates of lunch food, 18 plates of dinner food, 28 plates of lunch vegetables, 28 plates of dinner vegetables, 56 plates of soup, 20 bowls of potatoes, 24 plates of dry bread, 4 plates of dried eggs, 4 plates of butter, 8 plates of sweet biscuits, 8 plates of sweets, 16 plates of sugar cubes, 4 plates of tea, 8 plates of cocoa, 32 plates of pudding mix, 4 cakes, 10 pounds of corn flour, 8 plates of fruit sugar, 4 plates of oil, 64 cans of condensed milk, 20 cans of dried milk, 8 plates of wheat flour, 8 plates of dried plums, 4 plates of barley, 13 pounds of lentils, 8 bottles of fruit syrup, 8 bottles of coffee, 12 bottles of lemon juice, 8 bottles of honey, and 25 pounds of flour. As for upper-class overseas Chinese, given their wealth, they can freely purchase as much as they wish. Even following the methods of foreigners would not pose a problem. However, middle- and lower-class overseas Chinese constitute the majority. For a family of ten, the minimum food storage required would be 200 catties of rice, 15 catties of cooking oil, 500 catties of firewood, 5 catties of salt, 200 salted eggs, 10 catties of salted fish, 20 catties of salted pork, 10 catties of sugar, 5 jars of fermented bean curd, 20 pieces of preserved bean curd, 10 catties of preserved mustard greens, 15 catties of vegetables, and 4 catties of soy sauce. In winter, the storage of sausages and preserved meats can be increased as appropriate. Storing food in summer is more difficult than in winter. At the same time, due to the financial constraints of the general middle and lower classes, storing even the minimum one-month supply of food may be challenging. It is unclear how the authorities will resolve this issue of food storage for the majority of residents.</p>
<p>Building an Airfield in Taiping</p>
<p>According to yesterday's report in the Hong Kong Telegraph, reliable sources indicate that the Japanese army has recently been constructing a large airfield about fifty miles from Hong Kong. The initial news of this reached Hong Kong from a refugee who had fled from Dongguan. Subsequent investigations by reporters have confirmed this news. The location of the Japanese airfield is in Taiping, which is part of Dongguan County. Once the airfield is completed, Japanese aircraft taking off from there can reach Hong Kong airspace in just ten minutes, calculated at the most ordinary speed. The airfield is approximately five to six miles away from the Humen Forts. The Japanese troops stationed there are currently forcing local villagers to work on the construction. Those conscripted are only provided with food and no wages. The project began last week, and although it is not yet fully completed, Japanese aircraft have already been taking off and landing there. Recently, some of the Japanese aircraft participating in the battles on the East River front also took off from this airfield.</p>
<p>Building Safety Cellars in the New Territories</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, in addition to the Hong Kong government actively strengthening the defense capabilities of Hong Kong, the public is also actively planning for the prevention and evacuation in the event of a future war, under the guidance of the government. Due to the terrain of Hong Kong, the general public's evacuation target is the villages in the New Territories, as the New Territories have more mountains, which are safer than other places in the event of war. According to information obtained by reporters from people in the construction industry, most of the wealthy in Hong Kong are now planning for the safety in the event of a future war and are spending heavily to build shelters in remote areas of the New Territories. The construction of these houses is not much different in appearance from ordinary villas, but the interior has various safety facilities for avoiding bullets and poison gas. As of now, there are more than ten newly built villas of this type, and several more have been under construction in the past two months. When these shelters were being built, the villa owners spared no expense in hiring military strategists to survey the sites. Their locations are mostly chosen to avoid proximity to urban railways, highways, and other military strongholds. The construction of underground cellars is a must for every new building. Currently, in addition to the newly built houses with the above-mentioned safety and defense facilities, other existing villas in the New Territories are also hiring workers to build them, in preparation for a safe haven in the event of war.</p>

<p>Robberies have been rampant in various places for the past month. Unexpectedly, just as the authorities were planning to tightly secure the New Territories, two robberies occurred again yesterday morning at 1 a.m. The first case involved the San Hop Hing Chinese medicine store in Lok Ma Chau, where the owner, Li Cheung, was robbed by six armed thieves of more than three hundred dollars. The second case was a farmhouse without a street number in Tai Po, New Territories, where the owner, Chung Kai-fat, was robbed of dozens of dollars by six thieves. The details of the two robberies are described below.</p>
<p>Six Thieves Rob a Chinese Medicine Store in the New Territories</p>
<p>The San Hop Hing Chinese medicine store at the entrance of San Tin Village, Lok Ma Chau, New Territories, is owned by Li Cheung (51 years old) and co-owned by Mak Hing and Leung Tsan. There are four partners and three other women. The business has been profitable throughout the year, making it a target for thieves. At 1 a.m. yesterday, as everyone was sound asleep, thieves suddenly broke open the door, making a loud noise. Li Cheung was awakened by the noise. Li knew that they were thieves and was about to get up and call for help, but the thieves had already entered the store. Among the six thieves, one was holding a hand grenade, one was holding a revolver, and one was holding a metal crowbar. Seeing that they had such dangerous weapons, Li was frightened and was stopped from making any noise. He was pushed into the room, and the door was tied tightly with hemp rope. Then, they searched the store extensively, emptying boxes and overturning cabinets, taking everything of value in the store, leaving nothing behind. Before leaving, the thieves cut the hemp rope tying the door with a knife and fled with loud cries. After the thieves left, Li checked the lost items and went to the police station to report the case for investigation. The total loss was valued at $368.29.</p>
<p>Farmhouse in Tai Po Robbed Again</p>
<p>A mud house without a street number in Tong Lin Village, at the entrance of the Lam Tsai Shan valley in Tai Po, New Territories, is inhabited by five people. The owner, Chung Kai-fat (41 years old), works as a sailor on a ship. His son, Chung Kam-lung (17 years old), his nephew, Chung Tin (15 years old), Yau Ting-song (21 years old), and Wong Kam-wah (65 years old) live in the house together. Unexpectedly, at 1:25 a.m. yesterday, six thieves suddenly broke in. Three of the thieves were holding short guns, making a menacing display. As soon as they entered the house, they restrained everyone and then began searching, taking everything clean in about three minutes, and then calmly fled. Chung went to the police station to report the case yesterday morning. The stolen items included a gold watch worth $25 and a gold ring worth $10, totaling $37.80. After receiving the report, the police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to Yang Xie to hunt down the thieves.</p>

<p>Amateur Association of the Banking Industry Actively Launches Activities, Held a Social Gathering Last Night</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Amateur Association of the Banking Industry in Hong Kong is one of the three major amateur groups in Hong Kong. The relationship of mutual support and common development with the Amateur Association is becoming closer. The Amateur Association of the Banking Industry is organized by progressive employees of various banks in Hong Kong, with more than 80 members. Since its establishment, it has been more than three months. Past work such as organizing a choir, a war drama troupe, a Mandarin class, promoting sports, publishing publications, and traveling and socializing have all shown remarkable results. In the future, they plan to establish art galleries, English classes, Cantonese classes, and banking tutoring schools.

<h3 id="e45">Hong Kong Weaving Association Helps Manufacturers Request Reduction of Electricity Fees in Kowloon; Peninsula Residents Have Doubled, Should Be No Reason for Refusal; Electricity Company Said to Be Considering a Reasonable Reduction <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Hundreds of manufacturers in Kowloon have recently appealed to the Kowloon Electricity Company through the Hong Kong Manufacturers Association, stating that with the increasing number of residents in Kowloon and the gradual prosperity of the market, the number of users has increased, and the electricity fees charged by the Kowloon Electricity Company for factories should be reduced appropriately. However, the electricity company has not made any statement to date. The Hong Kong Weaving Association, in order to take a unified step, has again requested the Kowloon Electricity Company to reduce electricity fees after several meetings. The request of Kowloon manufacturers to reduce electricity fees was made several years ago, but it was not accepted by the electricity company on the grounds that Kowloon had few residents, thus increasing electricity costs. Now that the number of Kowloon residents has more than doubled, there should be no reason to refuse. It is also learned that the Kowloon Electricity Company is considering a reasonable reduction in fees and will hold a board meeting to discuss and decide soon.</p>

<p>— Chi Cheuk</p>
<p>The Guangzhou YWCA Military Service Corps Held a Flag Presentation Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<p>The great era cannot contain the hearts of daughters. They finally threw away their makeup kits and put on their wartime robes.</p>
<p>When Guangzhou fell, the ruthless artillery fire of the Japanese scattered the Guangzhou YWCA members. However, this was a temporary separation, a process of growth and training. After wandering for a while, they reorganized strongly and bravely, and worked hard in Hong Kong and other places to carry out all their work.</p>
<p>Starting at 8 pm last night, the Guangzhou YWCA Military Service Corps held a flag presentation ceremony at the Hong Kong YWCA. This manifestation of spirit is truly "the light of women" and "the light of the nation," weaving together a great scene.</p>
<p>These excellent children - fourteen of them - some are students from Guangzhou, some are students from Hong Kong, and some have given up their careers to come. This young group - around fifteen or sixteen to twenty years old - have healthy bodies, lively spirits, and alert minds. In green military uniforms, blue ties, and white gloves, they were all tough and energetic, "Who can tell if I am male or female?" The one or two hundred friends sitting in the audience were ashamed, admired, and gained new inspiration.</p>
<p>Under an atmosphere of solemnity, the grand ceremony unfolded scene by scene:</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen Zuoxuan, the chairman, said: We must not forget patriotism because of escaping. We should be more patriotic because of escaping. - This is certainly a pertinent statement aimed at Hong Kong society.</p>
<p>After Mr. He Xiangning presided over the flag presentation ceremony, all the members of the corps swore: "Obey the teachings of the Premier, support the supreme leader. Serve the war of resistance, and spare no sacrifice." - The blood in everyone's body circulated rapidly.</p>
<p>After the oath, Mr. He Xiangning delivered a message, first extending that the Premier's Three Principles of the People are in line with Jesus's freedom, equality, and fraternity. We should "unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together," and then said that to serve the wounded soldiers and refugees on the front line, we must cherish the essence of our nation. Finally, using the experience of serving wounded soldiers in Shanghai, he encouraged the members not to be afraid of the smell or the dirt, but to work bravely for the country. - The elder's benevolent heart, every sentence is moving.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hu Jihong, the president of the YWCA, said: We must stand up straight and go to the front line. We should not have the affection of children. "I have come to serve, not to be served." Jesus's spirit of "washing the feet of his disciples" is our example.</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong YWCA and the True Light Girls' Middle School presented their flags, the corps leader, Zheng Qingguang, gave a reply.</p>
<p>He reported to everyone vividly about the heroic and hardworking situation of the front-line soldiers and their service process. Hearing about "lice growing on the body," "the song of salted fish and sausages," "a seventeen-year-old girl directing the entire army in guerrilla warfare"... especially made people laugh and sigh! Their work is truly great! Their spirit is truly cheerful!</p>
<p>Singing also touched everyone's hearts. The meeting ended at about 10 o'clock, and everyone's heartstrings were highly vibrating. Everyone was reluctant to leave, and the reporter got more inspiring good news.</p>
<p>The "Nethersole" Hospital will give the hospital site to the corps to train Samsung Ming and provide various conveniences. In addition, warm-hearted people from China and abroad, such as American Mrs. Nadini and the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, have generously donated large sums of money and medicines. These are all the assistance that the corps is grateful for. In particular, the original general secretary of the South China YWCA, the American "Yuan Mei," who provided spiritual and material assistance to the Guangzhou YWCA, gave us a deeper understanding of the international friends' noble sympathy that the War of Resistance will definitely win, and the justice and fairness of mankind are shining brighter day by day.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Eastern Front News: Enemy encircled and annihilated at the foot of Mount Luofu; invaders fleeing along the Boluo-Zengcheng highway; large numbers of enemy aircraft discovered in Haifeng, intentions unclear <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Dongjiang Quick Report] Our forces, after a planned withdrawal from Zengcheng, have adopted a steady and pragmatic strategy to cope calmly. Therefore, we maintain a favorable and proactive position in maintaining security. In recent days, the results of fierce battles with the enemy have been fruitful. The military situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Assault on Su Mao Ping, Encircled and Annihilated</p>
<p>The weather here has been extremely bad in recent days, with dark clouds and heavy rain, which is very favorable for our military operations. On the 21st, more than 600 enemy troops reinforced from Guangzhou to Zengcheng, equipped with more than ten small cannons, under the cover of aircraft, advanced through the rain towards our army's position at Su Mao Ping, at the foot of Mount Luofu. Our Wei and Chen regiments, garrisoning the area, defended the strategic location and calmly fought back. In addition, the Lin Junsheng unit of the Third District Guerrilla Force was dispatched to the enemy's rear, launching a surprise attack from behind, engaging the enemy in close combat. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered over a hundred casualties, not counting reinforcements, and fled in panic.</p>
<p>Invasion of Lychee Pass, Another Crushing Blow</p>
<p>According to a forward telephone report, at 4:00 PM that afternoon, another 150 enemy cavalry troops moved out from Yang Mei Long and invaded Lychee Pass. Our defending troops, Chen Ji's unit, having received prior notice, immediately dispatched 200 elite soldiers to ambush in the mountainous areas of Liu Tai and Jun Ping Feng, awaiting in strict formation. Soon, the enemy cavalry arrived swiftly. Our army remained silent, waiting for them to pass the position, and then suddenly launched an intercepting attack, using hand grenades and bayonets in close combat. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy fled in confusion along the Boluo-Zengcheng highway. Our army did not pursue. It was found that more than ten enemy soldiers were killed in the battle, and more than twenty warhorses were captured. In addition, two enemy horses were captured alive. We also suffered several casualties. Also, at 3:00 PM the same afternoon, twelve enemy aircraft (all bombers) flew along the Guangzhou-Zengcheng highway, spying on the areas of Feilongmen, Zheng Guo, and Pai Tan, dropping thirty to forty bombs, but most of them fell in the wilderness, and we suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships on Alert in the Shilong River</p>
<p>According to a telephone report from the front line in Shenzhen, on the evening of the 23rd, near Wen Tang on the Wan-Zhang Road, the Chen Liu unit of our guerrilla's *th company sent a team to attack the enemy in Wancheng, engaging the enemy in Zhenhua Road, Daxi Road, and the highway station outside the west gate of the city. The fierce battle lasted for more than an hour, killing more than ten enemy sentries. The enemy troops in the city heard the alarm and rushed to reinforce. Our team, having completed its mission, left calmly. Furthermore, the Yuan Huazhao unit of the Dongjiang Special Operations Detachment, recently assigned to the command of Commander Wang Ruozhou of the Fourth War Zone Guerrilla Column by order of Deputy Commander Zhang of the Fourth War Zone, was reorganized into the Fourth District Guerrilla Independent Detachment. Yuan's unit was originally stationed in the Pinghu, Guanlan, Longhua, and Buji areas along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Commander Wang Ruozhou, in order to strengthen the front-line defenses, secretly ordered Yuan's unit to advance towards Wancheng and Shilong. It is reported that Yuan (Huazhao), upon receiving the order, had already deployed his troops to the destination and participated in the battle. Therefore, the front-line strength has greatly increased. The enemy, entrenched in Wancheng, has now dispatched two wire-laying ships and more than ten motorboats from Humen to patrol the Shilong River, guarding against our surprise attacks.</p>
<p>Large Number of Enemy Aircraft Discovered in Haifeng</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 24th, twenty-four enemy aircraft were discovered in Haifeng, flying from the southeast across the sea. They did not drop bombs and continued flying towards Zijin and Longchuan. Their intentions are unclear.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Misinformation About Enemy Invasion of Huiyang and Boluo; False Alarm; The Truth Is Due to Misunderstanding of Armed Clashes in Jiazibu Township <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Huiyang Quick Report] After our Eastern Route Army launched a series of counter-attacks against the enemy, in order to contain our progress, the enemy, in addition to sending reinforcements to resist stubbornly, also released rumors of invading Huiyang and Boluo in an attempt to shake our army's morale. Yesterday, on the 20th, late at night, the county seat suddenly spread rumors that the enemy army was attacking Boluo, plotting to invade Huiyang. Upon hearing the news, the residents were greatly panicked and dispersed spontaneously. The chaotic situation was almost the same as on the eve of the fall of Huizhou last year. On the 21st, the reporter, in order to clarify the truth, made a special visit to the responsible persons of the military and political authorities here to inquire. It was learned that the reason for the rumors of the enemy's invasion of Huiyang was that late at night on the 20th, a telephone call was suddenly received from the Boluo County government, reporting that many figures were found along the river near Guanghe, with flashlights shining and gunshots quite frequent, suspected of being enemy troops coming to harass. Therefore, a request was made to send troops to defend. As a result, the people in Huicheng were somewhat agitated. It has now been ascertained that the evening event was due to armed clashes between the Chen and Huang families in Jiazibu Township and that it was by no means an enemy invasion. The authorities are now actively dispelling the rumors and stabilizing the people's minds. It is reported that we have deployed heavy troops in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River and the Luofu Mountains, and the defenses are exceptionally solid.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Enemy's Quagmire Deepens; The Diverse Scenes on Hainan Island; Internal Strife Between the Enemy's Army and Navy Increasingly Sharp; Fearful of Our Forces, They Implement Terrorist Policies <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Guangzhou Bay Special Report] Since the enemy invaded Qiongya (Hainan Island), it has been more than two months. The enemy is desperately seeking to completely occupy Qiongya and has spared no effort to send large reinforcements. However, due to the joint heroic resistance of our military and civilians and the launch of extensive guerrilla warfare, the stubborn enemy has been repeatedly annihilated. The enemy now feels that their quagmire is getting deeper and deeper. The recent situation on Qiong Island is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Intensifying Internal Strife Among the Invading Enemy Troops in Qiong</p>
<p>The enemy troops' invasion of Qiongya has been constrained by our guerrillas, who are tired of coping and unable to achieve their intended purpose. The enemy's army and navy invading Qiong are blaming each other, and conflicts of opinion are frequent. It is reported that the commander of the enemy's army in Qiong, Iida, recently had a conflict with Katsumada, the chief advisor to the army and navy on Hainan Island dispatched by the enemy, due to disagreements. At one meeting, they clashed with each other. Iida drew his gun to shoot Katsumada, but was dissuaded by other officers. Since then, Katsumada has been demoralized and has recently been absent due to illness. The two sides are at odds, and the internal strife has intensified. According to another report, the enemy general Iida, because the military situation has not progressed and he has been repeatedly punished by his superiors, has become passive and there are reports that he will resign and return home.</p>
<p>Implementing Terrorist Policies Against the People</p>
<p>In the two months since the enemy troops invaded Qiong, due to the exceptional activity of our guerrillas, they have suffered repeated heavy blows and are extremely angry. Therefore, they have been wantonly massacring and plundering the people in our occupied areas. Recently, they have implemented terrorist policies in an attempt to intimidate our people and make them submit to their clutches. According to visitors from Haikou, the number of people being indiscriminately killed and arrested by the enemy in recent days is countless. On the 12th of this month, the enemy in Haikou, under the pretext of convening a citizens' meeting, forced our resident citizens to attend the meeting. At that time, more than 400 people were forced to attend, but the enemy detained all of them and has not released them to this day. Their fate is unknown. The remaining citizens are in a state of panic and are looking for ways to escape. The entire city of Haikou has become a world of terror.</p>
<p>Guerrillas Active, Inflicting Repeated Blows on the Enemy</p>
<p>The people in all areas, because of the enemy's invasion and the brutal killings, are filled with hatred and vow to avenge their hometowns. Therefore, the guerrilla teams are exceptionally active, launching surprise attacks on the enemy troops. According to military intelligence, on the 18th of this month, our guerrillas advanced to a certain place several miles away from Qiongshan City and attacked the enemy, annihilating more than a hundred enemy soldiers and capturing a large number of guns, equipment, and documents. The enemy has now retreated into Qiong City and is trapped there, fearing another attack by our guerrillas. On the same day, the enemy airfield in Huachang, Chengmai County, was also suddenly attacked by a guerrilla team of ours. The fierce battle lasted for several hours. As a result, two to three hundred enemy soldiers were killed. The enemy transported the corpses to Hongshan Beipu near Haikou for cremation. The enemy was so ashamed and angry that they sent several enemy aircraft to fly to the villages near Huachang and indiscriminately bombed them, causing many civilian casualties. The situation is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops in Haikou Implement Martial Law</p>
<p>Recently, because our guerrilla teams have been exerting great effort and repeatedly breaking into enemy positions, the enemy troops are panic-stricken and have become extremely vigilant. Since the enemy occupied Haikou and Qiongzhou, they have established their headquarters at Qionghai Middle School outside the west gate of Fucheng. All combat strategies are issued from there. Recently, as our troops have launched offensives in Wenchang, Ding'an, and Qiongshan, the sounds of gunfire can be heard in the suburbs of each county city. The enemy troops are greatly alarmed and have been relocating various military agencies out of Haikou for days. Even the enemy headquarters is transporting its stored equipment and documents by vehicle, reportedly to be moved to ships to operate from there. The extent of their panic can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The New Haimen Steamer Harassed by the Enemy in Fujian; Safe Thanks to Protection by British Warship; Foreign Merchant Ships Often Illegally Harassed; Two Norwegian Ships Seized to Taiwan <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Disregarding international law, the enemy navy frequently harasses and illegally detains foreign merchant ships sailing along the Chinese coast, and even forcibly seizes them. Many ships have not yet been released. On the 18th of this month, the enemy ships harassing Wenhai again harassed foreign merchant ships, including the New Haimen, anchored in Fujian. In addition to burning the cargo barges of each ship, they also seized the Norwegian cargo ship Dali Hua, which has not yet been released. After the incident, this port received a telegram from Shantou reporting that the New Haimen was also detained for a time. People in this port expressed great concern about this. The ship arrived safely in port yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The reporter made a special visit to people on the ship, and they gave a detailed account of the events in Fuzhou, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>Encountering Enemy Harassment on the Waters of Fuzhou</p>
<p>This incident occurred on the 18th of this month at Fuzhou. At the time, the ship was anchored at Cangshi waters in Fuzhou, outside the blockade line set up by the Chinese military authorities in Fuzhou. It was loading cargo from Fuzhou, preparing to sail to Shantou, and then from Shantou to this port. At the same time, there were four other cargo ships anchored there: the British merchant ship Haikou, the Greek cargo ship Panama (transliteration), and the two Norwegian cargo ships Sanmin and Dali Hua. The above four ships were all anchored outside the blockade line. At the same time, several barges loading cargo from Fuzhou were anchored near the ships. The British warship Scott, stationed in Fuzhou to protect overseas Chinese, was also stationed near the ships. At noon on the 18th of this month, a single enemy ship invading the waters suddenly dispatched dozens of enemy soldiers, driving a motorboat to the anchorage. The enemy soldiers first boarded the Dali Hua and Sanmin ships, harassing them at will.</p>
<p>Setting Fire to Ships, Enemy Aircraft Threatening</p>
<p>At that time, there were many barges attached to the two ships, all fully loaded with Fuzhou export goods, ready to be transferred to the Sanmin for export. After the enemy soldiers boarded the ships and harassed them, they immediately threw ropes on the barges and dragged one of them away. When the enemy soldiers were wreaking havoc, many enemy aircraft flew low and circled over the ships, threatening them. The British warship Scott immediately sent many sailors, driving a motorboat to this ship (New Haimen) to provide strict protection. The English officer sent by the British warship immediately negotiated with the enemy regarding the enemy soldiers harassing the Dali Hua and Sanmin barges. The enemy soldiers, seeing that this ship was protected by British soldiers, immediately returned to the motorboat and retreated to the enemy ship.</p>
<p>Seizing Two Ships, Releasing One</p>
<p>The next day (the 19th), an enemy motorboat came again. At that time, the Haikou had already left Fuzhou and was sailing in Cangshi waters. Only this ship and the Sanmin, Dali Hua, and Babinla were left anchored. The enemy soldiers boarded the Sanmin and Dali Hua again. The owner of this ship, fearing that the enemy soldiers would wreak havoc again, immediately ordered the barges to quickly return to the port. The enemy soldiers then boarded this ship. The ship owner and the English officer met with the enemy soldiers. First, they asked about the nationality of this ship. The ship owner immediately replied that it was a British merchant ship. The enemy soldiers then asked if the cargo was being transported to China. The ship owner replied that the cargo was being transported to Hong Kong. The enemy soldiers could not find what they were looking for and retreated to the motorboat. They then went to the Dali Hua and Sanmin ships and used force to coerce the ship owners to follow the enemy ship and sail away from Fuzhou. It is reported that they have been taken to Taiwan. When this ship left Fuzhou, the Sanmin had been released and was sailing back. However, there has been no news of the release of the Dali Hua. It is reported that the seized Norwegian ship Dali Hua was full of timber. A month ago, a sister ship of the same company was originally planning to load cargo in Fuzhou and sail to Shanghai, but after the first ship sailed, it was seized by an enemy ship on the way. Therefore, the company authorities telegraphed the Dali Hua to temporarily anchor in Fuzhou and not sail.

<p>The Yusheng, a boat that goes between here and Shantou, arrived. A reporter went on board to interview the recent events in Shantou and is hereby providing a collection of what was found out.</p>
<p>Evacuation Situation</p>
<p>According to the crew, after Shantou entered wartime preparations, residents evacuated one after another. On the highways from Shantou to Chaozhou and other places, pedestrians were endless. 80-90% of the machines in the factories are being returned to the interior of the eight counties. The evacuation was carried out in good order. Those who are currently staying in Shantou belong to the local defense army, the Self-Defense Regiment, and a portion of people who are unwilling to leave due to business relations. The local area is still as peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>Slightly Less Cargo</p>
<p>Although the situation in Shantou is very tense, cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou is still normal. Ordinary cargo is less than before. As for grain and rice, they are still being shipped continuously from Hong Kong. Many of the rice and grain in Chaozhou and other counties rely on external supplies. They are being transshipped from Shantou. The amount of supplies being delivered still needs to be large.</p>

<p>Zhang Shichuan will soon direct "Li Sanniang" for Guohua, scheduled to start shooting tomorrow. It is reported that Zhang intends to resume Star Productions in the fall, as the company will be registered in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The day before Chen Yunshang left Shanghai, Tong Yuejuan specially gave her a diamond ring, worth 1,700 yuan (actual price). The rumored 17,000 yuan is not accurate.</p>
<p>The film industry in the occupied areas is very active. Previous productions by various companies have been pirated. Silent films sell for about 200 yuan each.</p>
<p>Manager Jin Cheng and Guohua Supervisor Shuangren Liu Zhonghao are busy promoting "Song Jue Lei Hen" these days.</p>
<p>Huang Jiamo's "Three Musketeers" movie song has been recorded by Baidai Company. This is his debut work and will definitely create a sensation.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang is practicing economy and has sold his car. There is also news that Wu Yonggang is going to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Xi Qiuyun is currently surrounded by various film companies, all wanting to sign a long-term contract with her. It is reported that Ms. Xi's conditions focus on the director and script. It remains to be seen which company will hire her.</p>
<p>Wu Cun will be returning to his hometown with his family, saying that he has no intention of staying in the isolated island film industry.</p>
<p>Someone said that Jin Yan's Lin Chong looks like a "Guerrilla Captain."</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong's "Yanzi Li San" has now been renamed "Yanzi Dao" and will be filmed after "Three-Episode Incarnation Girl."</p>
<p>"Wang Zhaojun" was originally planned to be filmed by Xinhua Company, and Li Minghui was designated as the lead actress at the time. Now that it is being filmed, the lead actress has been changed to Chen Yanyan.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua, who has been away from the silver screen for a long time, will soon be filming a new film, "Four Demon Kings."</p>
<p>The first scene of "Mysterious Madam" is a casting call for a beautiful face. The first scene of "Three-Episode Incarnation Girl" is a pair of treasures - Han Langen and Guan Hongda being bedridden.</p>
<p>After "Ying Cheng Ji", Chen Kengran has decided to direct "Women's Apartment."</p>
<p>The famous amateur singer Wang Huigu recently played the role of Su Qiu in "Mysterious Madam" as a guest appearance. Her initial tryout was amazing. If it's not a genius, how can one attain this? We hope she does well.</p>
<p>"Chu Bawang" (The Conqueror) is being screened in Hong Kong. The prosperity of the business is greater than in Shanghai, therefore it aroused the attention of Hong Kong film circles, who believe that the film has a very grand scene, thus causing the Hong Kong film circles to feel great interest. Thus there are plans for ten companies to jointly produce a costume drama, and thus Wang Cilong came to Hong Kong to answer the call.</p>

<p>(23) Leo McCarey, Best Director of 1937. Who would have believed that in his early years, he was directing Laurel and Hardy's short films? His famous films include Charles Laughton's "The Awful Truth", "Make Way for Tomorrow", and "The Gay Divorcee", which are all listed among the ten greatest films. Last year, he joined RKO as a producer and director. His first film is "Love Affair", starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, which is worth looking forward to.</p>
<p>(24) Wesley Ruggles, this great director, apart from Ernst Lubitsch, can be said to have no strong rivals in comedy. His collaboration with screenwriter Ping Yinshi is a cash cow for Paramount. His works include "Gold Diggers of 1935", "Cimarron", "Sin Takes a Holiday", "Invitation to Happiness", "Sing, You Sinners", etc. In his early years, he won an Oscar for directing "Cimarron". He is the brother of humorous star Charlie Ruggles, but he has never directed Charlie's films. His next film will star Irene Dunne and Ray Milland. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Basketball Association Meeting Tonight to Discuss Shenbao Cup Charity Tournament; Summer is Approaching, Hope to Organize it Soon <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special Report) At the end of last year, our newspaper suggested to the Basketball Association to find ways to hold a women's charity event to raise funds to help our compatriots. The trophy would be donated by our newspaper. At that time, Mr. Gao Xiwei, Chairman of the Association, expressed his agreement and proposed it at the Executive Committee meeting, which resolved to hold it.</p>
<p>Later, the Association re-elected its officers and focused on organizing the open men's league. Due to being busy, the resolution for the charity tournament was put aside. Until now, there is still no definite news about when it will be held.</p>
<p>Since the new officers of the Association were elected, they have been very active in carrying out the association's affairs, which has been well received by all parties. Therefore, it is hoped that the association will not forget about the charity tournament and will try to make it happen in the near future. If it is not held soon, it will not be suitable when the hot summer weather arrives, because that narrow basketball hall is really not suitable for holding a competition that attracts a large number of spectators in the summer.</p>
<p>In short, the Association, remembering this unfinished matter, will hold an Executive Committee meeting tonight to discuss preparations for organizing it.</p>
<p>Regarding the participating teams, the idea from relevant parties is that since this is a charity tournament, it is best to keep it open. Every unit, whether it is a school or a group, should be able to form a strong team to participate in the competition, without strict restrictions. If this is the case, it can greatly increase the interest of the entire tournament. Moreover, this is a charitable cause, and the only meaning is to appeal for the suffering compatriots. The principle of championship should not be overemphasized. For basketball players, it is just a small effort, so why not do it? (Dong Lang)</p>

<p>The All-Hong Kong Open Tennis Singles Semi-Finals were held yesterday afternoon, and Xu Wei Pei met Da Lin Zhen. Many people came to watch, and the seats were full. This match was a best-of-five-sets format, and the starting time was advanced by fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>In the first set, Da Lin Zhen used offense as defense, and his forehand sweeps were beautiful and interesting, taking the lead all the way, with an absolute advantage of five to two. Everyone thought that Da Xu would definitely give up the first set, save his energy, and then plan in the second set. However, Da Xu calmly responded, using left-handed strokes and right-handed chops to chase to a five-to-five tie. Da Lin Zhen tried his best to counterattack, his strokes and presses were exquisite, and the applause was endless, taking the lead again with six to five. Da Xu didn't take it to heart and calmly parried, finally winning the first set with nine to seven.</p>
<p>In the second set, Da Xu changed his strategy, using the method of returning the attack near the net, making Da Lin Zhen run around, reducing his energy. Da Lin Zhen tried his best to cope, although he exhausted a lot of energy, he didn't care, and he kept smashing all the way, and his ambition was finally realized, winning back one set with six to two, but at this time he was already panting like a cow.</p>
<p>In the third set, Da Xu took advantage of his opponent's fatigue and began to smash and press, the angles were accurate and sharp, Da Lin Zhen found it difficult to cope and could not parry, so Da Xu won another set with a score of six to one.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, Da Xu's situation improved in the third set, and at this point, his determination to fight was even stronger. Although Da Lin Zhen did not show weakness, he once took the lead with a three-to-one game, but Da Xu shook his spirits again, and his divine power was greatly displayed, his long strokes and short hits were all appropriate, and he completed the final set with a six-to-three in one go. The overall result was three to one, Da Xu won.</p>
<p>Another singles semi-final will be held today, Xu Run Pei vs. Li Yingtang. Xiao Xu is a rising star with extraordinary skills, while Li is rich in experience and can often win with skill. Today, Xiao Xu meets him, and their ball skills each have their own merits, so it is impossible to predict who will win.</p>

<p>The Youth Association, feeling that the weather has gradually become familiar, has specially started the elementary swimming class earlier. Registration started a few days ago, and there were many participants.

The cost is only 20 cents for the boat fare (Hong Kong to Kowloon, Kowloon to Hong Kong). If you take a boat from Sai Kung back to Hong Kong, it will be about 50 cents.

<h3 id="e66">What Chinese People Should Do in the All-Out War of Resistance <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has reached its current stage, and the war zone has spread across the country. North China, Central China, East China, and South China are all covered with war clouds. Under the joint initiation of "guerrilla warfare," "mobile warfare," and "positional warfare," battles are taking place almost anytime and anywhere. The huge consumption of resources in the military aspect can be imagined. To compensate for this consumption, we must not only open up sources of income, but also cut spending. If any member of the public or any industry can save a penny, the economic power of the War of Resistance will be enriched by one point, the sustainability of the War of Resistance will be extended by one moment, and the certainty of final victory will be increased by one point.</p>
<p>If the physical exercise industry can strive for economy, it can ultimately contribute to the economy of the War of Resistance to some extent. This is the principle that current sports must adhere to: economy.</p>
<p>Since this War of Resistance is all-out, we should follow the leader's declaration that "everyone, regardless of gender, age, or strength, should resist the war." Every member of the Chinese nation is responsible for the War of Resistance. To shoulder this arduous and difficult responsibility, it is difficult to be competent without quickly possessing a physique like a cast iron pot. To enable everyone to quickly possess a strong physique, there must first be a sport that can be effectively implemented by everyone in a short period of time. Engaging in exercise without achieving results, complicated movements, numerous methods, consuming a lot of time in learning, and spending little time on exercise, or sports that only a few people can learn and most people cannot, are definitely not the ideal sports we need. This is the principle that current sports must adhere to: ease of learning.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned reason that everyone must possess a strong physique to support the precarious situation, then this type of sport must be able to be implemented by everyone, everywhere, and at all times among our 450 million people and within our 3.5 million square miles of territory, whether it is spring, summer, autumn, winter, wind, rain, morning, or dusk. If it limits the number of people, the venue, the weather, the equipment, etc., and only a few people, a few regions, or a few times can do it, while the majority cannot, it is difficult to achieve widespread implementation and great results. This is the principle that current sports must adhere to: ease of implementation.</p>
<p>Today's sports methods, Chinese, foreign, old, and newly emerging, are too numerous to count. Let's try to review them according to the above three principles. Which ones are suitable for the current needs? Those who love national sports think that playing ball is sports, and sports that are not ball games are not sports. Buying balls requires money, and building venues and equipment requires money. It does not conform to the principle of economy. The movements are complex and the methods are numerous. It is not something that most people without athletic talent or foundation can learn. It does not conform to the principle of ease of learning. It cannot be done with many people or few people. It cannot be done without venues and equipment. It does not conform to the principle of ease of implementation. Is it the track and field sport that is the most agile and can dazzle for a while? It has the same shortcomings as ball games to some extent. Is it horseback riding, swimming, and all kinds of apparatus gymnastics? They either require funding and equipment, or they are difficult to learn, or they must choose the time and place to implement them. These are not the sports that we urgently need in the current environment. I think the sports we need now are "national martial arts," "calisthenics," "running," and "mountain climbing." Let me explain the reason.</p>
<p>National martial arts and calisthenics can be done with equipment, and can also be done without equipment. This is economy. One person can do it, and hundreds or thousands of people can do it. It can be done in the open air when the weather is clear, and it can also be done in a small room when it is raining. This is easy to do. Although their movements also need to be learned, once guided, anyone can imitate them, and after learning a part or a set, they can practice it for life. This is easy to learn.</p>
<p>Climbing and running not only do not require any equipment or cost a penny, but they also do not need to be learned. As long as you can walk and run, there is no way you can't do these sports. Although running is difficult in rainy weather, and climbing is impossible in places without mountains, you can still use national martial arts or calisthenics to replace it when it rains, and you can use running to replace it in places where there are no mountains to climb. It still does not violate the principle of ease of implementation.</p>
<p>In short, if we can practice these four sports alternately, not only those that cannot be done can be replaced with each other, but also those that are biased towards the lower limbs, such as climbing and running, can be remedied with the upper limb movements of national martial arts and calisthenics. The movements of national martial arts, which involve more limbs, can be remedied with the trunk movements of calisthenics. Those who are new to exercise or are weak can use national martial arts and calisthenics to build a good foundation before climbing and running. If everyone can truly make up their minds to do it, then regardless of gender or age, in a small room, in a deserted mountain, in windy or rainy weather, or in cold or hot seasons, there is no place or time where they cannot practice sports without spending a penny, truly achieving the mission of universally improving their physique.</p>
<p>Some people say that these sports are monotonous, boring, and lack interest. Forcing oneself to do them will definitely feel pain in the spirit. It is better to do ball games and track and field sports, which are free and lively and have a strong interest, which can make people develop the intention of self-exercise, and the value comes to be great. Indeed, some people can have this kind of phenomenon. The author has always loved this kind of fascinating sports, and I deeply agree with this statement.</p>
<p>However, let's examine carefully how many people in the whole country can play ball games and other sports. What is the result of schools having formal classes and training in these sports all day long? Isn't it just cultivating a few special athletes with athletic talent? Isn't the sports field the exclusive property of a few flamboyant athletes? Most students still don't know what these sports are, even if they exist, it's as if they don't. The so-called interest is just the interest of a few people.</p>
<p>As for saying that the movements of national martial arts and calisthenics are monotonous, and climbing and running lack interest, it is true that they have not recognized the true meaning of these sports. The so-called monotonous movements are by no means a problem in themselves, but a problem of the method of operation and the selection of materials. The same kind of materials, those that are monotonous can be improved by making the method of operation lively, and in terms of material selection, it can be arbitrarily controlled whether it is monotonous or lively. In addition to exercising the physique, climbing and running can also appreciate the scenery of nature, roam the eyes and enjoy the heart, and sing a song after reaching the destination, which can cultivate character, which is not something that ball games and other sports that are confined to one corner can achieve. What's more, the great achievements of national martial arts in annihilating the enemy have been indelible. After the War of Resistance has shifted to the mountainous areas, the skills of crossing mountains and ridges and advancing and retreating quickly are even more closely related to climbing and running.</p>
<p>The success of a career must be achieved through hard work. The so-called "bitterness ends with sweetness" and "eating all the hardships in bitterness to become a superior person" is the meaning of this. If we give up doing it because it is "boring" or "painful," then our War of Resistance today, seeking life in death, can be said to be incomparably difficult, and it can be said to be extremely boring to plan to kill the enemy and achieve results all day long. We can also stop here and be at ease as slaves and horses of the enemy. Is this the attitude we should have?</p>
<p>Compatriots, at this final juncture of life and death, we seem not to ignore the facts, not to examine the surroundings, and still only seek pleasure and value interest, and specialize in doing those aristocratic and pleasurable sports, and not be willing to strengthen our will and struggle to overcome difficulties to seek the liberation of the nation and the freedom of the country.</p>

<p>— Translated by Chen Baorong</p>
<p>This article was written by the German economist Wagner, and translated from the Japanese International Economic Weekly, issue 991. The original title was "The Formation of Prices and Their Stabilization Policy"! Translator</p>
<p>Monetary System Based on Labor</p>
<p>The central issue of price policy is none other than the issue of stabilizing prices. How to prevent changes in the price market when drastic changes occur within the economy. There are often various reasons for believing that this kind of fact is irresistible, and even the so-called "quantitative boom" is based on "price boom." In the past, capital and its income always occupied the center of economic life, but today, the key to our desire to analyze all economic phenomena will be found in labor and its payment. Therefore, although Germany's monetary system was initially based on gold, today it has been changed to labor as its foundation. At first, we believed that the best way to guarantee the future material life of the people was to accumulate currency, but today, this kind of guarantee for currency has lost its confidence. What has replaced it is our right to labor, and it is necessary to grant it permanent labor rights. Moreover, it is not only the right to carry out labor, but also to guarantee its income at any time.</p>
<p>Germany's New Price Policy</p>
<p>Since the economic theory of the German National Socialist government fundamentally adopts this kind of attitude, it can be used to explain the impact of price changes and the various reasons for price changes based on economic fluctuations. Therefore, the new price policy of the National Socialist government is not only satisfied with eliminating the current obstacles. In the past, the most outstanding price commissioners only needed to solve their practical problems in an agile way, but now, in addition to practical problems, it is also necessary to solve their fundamental principles, that is, how to make price changes fully adapt to today's economic life. High-price policy, that is, the policy of striving to raise prices and seek to overcome panic, may not be able to stimulate the general economy and recognize the prosperity, but the sharp rise in prices does have various major dangers, and must be given deep warning. In the transitional period, although high prices may have the effect of revitalizing the economy, they are also creating deadly toxins at the same time. Therefore, German National Socialism does not unconditionally oppose the rise in prices, nor does it unconditionally adopt the policy of preventing the rise in prices. For this kind of enterprise, the essence is also completely different from the general policies. In a word, it is to seek to establish a fair price.</p>
<p>Establish a "Fair Price"</p>
<p>When a tendency for prices to rise is found in all aspects of the economy, that is, on the one hand, it has affected external economic relations and has a negative effect, and on the other hand, the raw material economy has changed due to the increase in the burden of ancestors. This tendency is still unable to fully overcome the panic that dominates the various sectors of the economy. In this situation, the National Socialist government, on the one hand, sets "maximum prices" so that the vigorous plan in the price policy is fully and reasonably completed to maintain the possibility of construction, and on the other hand, conducts individual and fundamental reviews of the various economic parts to ensure that the prices of each part are in line with the characteristics of that part, that is, individually applies various special controls.</p>
<p>Examining price policy cannot only focus on monetary prices. If this point of view is used, it cannot be consistent with its purpose. Usually, when prices fall, there is always hope for them to rebound, but it is not known that the level of prices is not the main issue. The truly main issue is whether the interrelationship between prices is balanced and whether they are mutually adapted to the national economic life and other factors. In other words, whether the price level maintains a fair relationship is the focus of the issue.</p>
<p>The so-called "fair relationship" is generally determined by the national economy. Therefore, the concept of price must be criticized from the standpoint of the entire national economy, that is, criticized from the business point of view on the one hand, and criticized from the market price on the other hand.</p>
<p>Today's prices in Germany are adapted to production on the one hand, and adapted to labor income on the other hand. The only thing that the German leader is most concerned about for the German economy today is how to adjust the necessary labor.</p>
<p>The Task of Germany's Price Policy</p>
<p>In recent years, although Germany's price policy has fulfilled its function of stabilizing economic life, it has not yet been able to fulfill its task in this way. Because in a certain period, it should try to reduce the impact of external price increases (that is, reduce the impact of the world's price increases), and at a certain time, it should try to help open up sales markets and establish appropriate and strong prices. After the technological development of new raw materials, it should determine how to enter the market at a price, and even solve all the needs in social policy and the technical problems in supply, etc. New tasks can be generated in price policy.</p>

<h3 id="e70">On Doing Good Deeds by Zhang Chunfeng <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>Feng Yingwang has a poem: "Just know to do good deeds, don't ask about the future." This contrived saying has the same steadfast and unyielding spirit as the saying "Laugh at those who cry for help, I will be a good official myself."</p>
<p>In fact, these two lines of poetry, when discussed today, must first be given a footnote, otherwise, it is very easy to be greatly misled. For example, everyone knows that donating wealth to the country is a good thing, a responsibility that every Chinese person should fulfill, but it is inevitable that petty people will take the opportunity to amass wealth, swindle, and extort. Just like some time ago, some people even used the name of an art exhibition to help disaster relief to carry out fraudulent fundraising, and as a result, the charity money was embezzled, and they absconded with the donations. From this, it can be seen that although good deeds should be done, it is right to ask about the future first, otherwise, not only will you be deceived, but villains will also take advantage of these two lines of poetry to perform their tricks, which is what we should be wary of first.</p>
<p>The Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian scholar Shao Kangjie had words to teach his son: "You should certainly do good, but you must also do it according to your ability. If you don't measure your ability, even if it is good, you shouldn't do it."</p>
<p>Although these words make Feng Lianwang's poetry more reasonable, they only see one side and miss the other. That is, people who do good deeds must of course have the effort of measuring, which means that the recipient of the good deeds should also have some measuring work. Measuring is not only measuring and weighing, but also the work of on-site investigation. For example, if the people who cheated money through the art exhibition had been suspected and investigated at the beginning of their scam, the scam would probably not have succeeded.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Elegance and Vulgarity <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Moye</p>
<p>In the past, the elegant scholar Ni Yunlin was caught by Zhang Shixin in Taihu Lake one day and whipped almost to death because he refused to write for Zhang Shixin. But he did not utter a word while being whipped. Someone asked him the reason, and he said: "Opening my mouth would be vulgar."</p>
<p>Unbelievable, such an elegant scholar, not even caring about his life, is truly rare. However, isn't such affectation a bit too elegant? Because in my opinion, not opening one's mouth can only be considered tough and unyielding, a good man, but has nothing to do with elegance. If you deliberately want to use this as elegance, it would be too elegant and become vulgar.</p>
<p>Too elegant becomes vulgar, just like what is said in *The Scholars*, "elegance becomes too vulgar." At that time, ordinary literati would drink wine, look at flowers, and compose poems at the slightest opportunity, claiming to be refined, so Wu Jingzi greatly ridiculed them for a while, and it is still a topic of conversation today.</p>
<p>Speaking of this kind of elegant habit, it seems that the remaining influence is still not completely gone today, or it has even become more intense, with everything having to be elegant, and nothing willing to be vulgar. There is no need to say anything else, just take the elegant names, pen names, and aliases of a few people as an example. They have already exhausted the wonders of elegance, and one cannot help but sigh at the exquisiteness of elegance. There was a time when names always used flowers, birds, insects, and fish to represent them, and were accompanied by melancholic and sorrowful adjectives. This can be said to be soft-style elegance. Now, it has finally changed, and everyone is using "口口口口口, 口口口口" these words to name themselves. This may be said to be hard-style.</p>
<p>I am not saying that these names are not elegant at all. On the contrary, I admit that they are elegant. But when one person initiates and many people follow, any elegant thing becomes unbearably vulgar, just as Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty was an elegant person with many elegant deeds. The likes of Tang Bohu and Zhang Mengjin of the Ming Dynasty, imitating others awkwardly, made people want to vomit.</p>
<p>It is certainly not easy to define elegance and vulgarity. However, I say that there seems to be some scope here, in addition to the initiator being elegant and the followers being vulgar, there is also: the intentional being vulgar, the unintentional being elegant. I find Ni Yunlin to be vulgar because of his intentionality. He was originally a person from the end of the Yuan and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, which coincides with what is said in *The Carnal Prayer Mat*, that people of the Yuan Dynasty each had an alias, so he was called Yunlinzi, which is also one of the signs of his vulgarity. As for his old habit of being obsessed with cleanliness, he was simply learning from Bi Miyuanzhang, and only made his vulgarity reek. Dang Jixian's writing poems in Beijing and in Hanoi can be seen in the same light: imitating elegance, vulgar, vulgar, vulgar!</p>
<p>Mo Junli's "Acting Pretensely"—imitating Gao Junerji's elegant name—is a portrait of these elegant people. I want to collect these materials, and I am afraid that there are countless of them, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, which can be used for combat and can fill countless volumes.</p>
<p>However, elegant things are only for literati, and illiterate people have no share; therefore, just as there are too many elegant literati who become vulgar, there are also too many vulgar illiterate people who become elegant. Grand Tutor Dang's gold-decorated account, lamb and fine wine, is a clear example of this, while the Black Whirlwind of Liangshan opening his mouth with "Laozi" and closing his mouth with "Iron Ox" is really cute and not vulgar at all. Even Ah Q under Lu Xun's pen, several times saying "I want...", I also consider him the second most elegant person in modern times. Why? It is only because of their innocence, unintentional towards elegance, and what they say and do, unprecedented and unmatched, naturally wonderfully unique, and vulgar to the point of being too elegant.</p>
<p>Among the literati, Huang Shangu is still somewhat reasonable. When he arrived in Xuanzhou, someone asked him to write calligraphy, and he accepted all requests and responded to every need. Some people felt sorry for him because he gave it to vulgar people. He smiled and said, "If there is a non-vulgar person, bring one to me to see." These words are truly extremely pleasant. Conversely, who is an elegant person, who is not a vulgar person? From this, I can also see some of the truth about elegance and vulgarity.</p>
<p>I often hear people say that articles should be "appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar" to be considered excellent articles. I don't quite believe this, because what can be appreciated by the elegant cannot necessarily be appreciated by the vulgar, and what can be appreciated by the vulgar cannot necessarily be appreciated by the elegant. Therefore, I think that perhaps "not appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar" is an excellent article. As for my not-so-excellent article, since it is difficult to approach elegance and difficult to descend to vulgarity, I can only say that it is "not appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar."</p>
<h3 id="e72">Mother and Son <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Just after putting down the rice bowl, Big Mazi's wife and son started arguing again in the low house.</p>
<p>"Damn it, really damn it!" Uncle Shubo knocked on his dry tobacco pipe, stretched out his firewood-like hand, wiped off the porridge soup stained on his whiskers, moved his mouth and said: "With such a tired mouth, what are they arguing about so fiercely? They can't even get food in their mouths, but they have the leisure to quarrel, alas, alas!" He sighed while groping for his already empty dry tobacco pouch.</p>
<p>Aunt Shubo was tearing apart the old clothes under the eaves of the house, pulling out the stocking yarn to make wicks. Seeing Uncle Shubo sitting on the threshold sighing, she turned her head and glanced at him: "Old thing, mind your own business, take care of yourself! You won't die from smoking a few less pipes. Didn't you hear Wang Er, who carries the groceries, say that he went to the city to get some goods and suffered the anger of those Japanese soldiers? He almost took off the felt hat on his head, but he was beaten until his teeth bled, and he was hit twice in the back with rifle butts. He swore not to go into the city again, and would sell off the remaining goods, preferring to starve to death at home. So even if you have money, you won't be able to buy tobacco to smoke." She said venomously.</p>
<p>"See when these evil ghosts will cause trouble..." Uncle Shubo swept the ground and added a line.</p>
<p>But the mother and son in Big Mazi's low house were arguing even more fiercely, with curses, wails, and the sound of breaking bowls coming one after another. Aunt Shubo, who had just told Shubo not to interfere, dropped the broken clothes and yarn balls, and was the first to run to the low house, muttering: "Alas, arguing, arguing, turning the world upside down, it's still mother and son... what good can come of it..."</p>
<p>Just as Aunt Shubo was about to step into the threshold of the low house, Big Mazi's son desperately rushed out of the house, followed by Big Mazi's wife, her face turning from white to green with anger, panting, clutching a door bar in her hand, obviously trying to chase after and beat her son. Aunt Shubo was quick-witted and quick-handed, grabbing her and saying, "What's wrong? Why are you so angry? Calm down, what big deal is there between mother and son? It's always better to discuss things. After your husband, Big Mazi, died, he left only this little treasure, and there are no other daughters and daughters-in-law here."</p>
<p>"Auntie, you don't know, uh, today I must beat him half to death, this unfilial wretch! Does he even have me, his mother, in his eyes!" Big Mazi's wife couldn't get rid of her anger for a moment.</p>
<p>Aunt Shubo managed to persuade and drag her to her own door, and placed a stool for her to sit down. "Ah, ah, Big Mazi's wife, everything can only be done roughly these days." Uncle Shubo wiped his beard and stood up from the threshold, saying this.</p>
<p>"I'm not hiding it from you, uncle and aunt. I'm willing to agree to anything else he wants, but I won't agree to this!" Big Mazi's wife gritted her teeth, looking very determined. Aunt Shubo eagerly asked: "What exactly is going on?" Big Mazi's wife snorted and then said a long string of words:</p>
<p>"What's going on! He's going to be a worker for the Japanese soldiers, repairing the motor road! Do you think his heart is good? Big Mazi was shot dead by the Japanese soldiers next to the motor road. For no reason, he died so pitifully, lying in the ditch, his head shattered by the shot, blood flowing into the ditch, brain matter flowing into the ditch. At that time, the Japanese soldiers had just arrived, and no one dared to collect the body during the day. Uncle and aunt, you all know. It was the Jiangbei man from the ancestral hall who secretly dragged him back at night... This unfilial wretch, isn't he blind and can't see? Now he doesn't want to avenge his father, but he wants to be a worker for the Japanese soldiers. Hmph, earn money! I don't care about millions of taels of silver, I'd rather starve to death, but I won't allow him to earn blood money... I want him to see his father... Big Mazi's corpse..." When she said this, her voice trembled so much that she couldn't continue, and she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Uncle Shubo was indignant when he heard this, and knocked his dry tobacco pipe on the stone slab, intending to find Big Mazi's son in the village to teach him a lesson. "We don't allow anyone in our village to be a traitor!" He muttered to himself.</p>
<h3 id="e73">[A Discussion of a Decisive Battle] <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mei</p>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, twenty-one months have passed. Although Japan has relied on its own superior military equipment to achieve victories in form, what it has gained are only a few transportation lines and a few cities. The vast land still remains in the hands of the Chinese army, and the battle line is prolonged and scattered, which is deeply taboo for military strategists. If a full-scale counter-offensive is launched, and all areas are intercepted, communication will be cut off, and the head and tail will not be able to take care of each other, inevitably leading to collapse. However, when Japan launched the Lugouqiao Incident, it originally wanted to take some small advantages, but it never expected to receive the most fatal retaliation of "long-term resistance." As the war has progressed to the present, it has become more and more deeply mired in the quagmire, revealing its embarrassing situation. Its own regular army, reserve army, and Korean-Japanese army have all been deployed to the front line to fight, and it still feels that it is not enough to allocate. In the occupied "Kingdom of Righteousness and Paradise," it keeps bumping into Chinese troops, gaining this piece and losing that piece, getting dizzy, and becoming exhausted. It can be seen that the collapse of the Japanese army is not far away. We can get stronger proof by looking at the following telegrams.</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Lieutenant General Sakuraji, commander of the Japanese army in Central China, declared: "Please China's government send strong troops to the Central Plains for a decisive battle, and no longer run around to the east and west, losing its national dignity," and so on.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Sakuraji's declaration coincides with the words of Lieutenant General An Teng, commander of the Japanese army in South China, on December 19 last year, "I wish Chairman Chiang would come to Guangdong with his military qualifications for a desperate battle," which are similar and consistent. It can be seen that they have reached the end of their road and are not far from collapse!</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily once said that General Joffre of the European War retreated completely after being defeated in Belgium and finally won an unprecedented victory on the Marne River, which is definitely correct and unwavering. These days, the counter-offensive in various parts of Central China has been a great victory, like a bamboo being split. It is the prelude to the transformation of defeat into victory in the second stage of the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>From this, we know that Sakuraji's declaration is nothing more than a lament before the collapse.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Snow of Manchuria <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"It's just a small knife wound, what can't be forgiven?"</p>
<p>"A knife wound can be forgiven—" After she spoke to herself? She let go of her emotions and casually asked, "What if it's a gunshot wound?"</p>
<p>"If it's a gunshot wound, you're dead!"</p>
<p>"If you're still alive?"</p>
<p>He smiled coldly, replacing the answer. Then, he deliberately asked her sternly:</p>
<p>"If you had a gun last night?"</p>
<p>"Then you wouldn't die in my house, you'd die on the street!"</p>
<p>At this time, she remembered the scene of last night again, especially his devilish eyes; the hateful night, came again. Hatred regained her heart, and the meager friendship she had gained today was thrown into the fire like snow. She avoided him, softly fell beside the bed, and cried.</p>
<p>When he called her, she bravely stood up, found his cheek, and slapped him hard. She stopped crying, pointed at his eyes, and shouted irritably:</p>
<p>"Get out, you bandit!"</p>
<p>He was at a loss, listening blankly to her curses.</p>
<p>"Enemy, you dog thing, I can't forget you..."</p>
<p>At this time, he was to her like a model mother to a mischievous child; when the child is crying and acting wilfully, she must try her best to obey her, make her happy, and then correct her mistakes. He tried his best to control his often impulsive feelings, and gave her a forced smile, as if he could let her hit him—if she could satisfy her desires. She pushed him away hatefully, not allowing him to come close, fearing that he harbored evil intentions. He became even more bored and had no choice but to step aside and ask:</p>
<p>"What about our friendship just now?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Friendship, friendship!"</p>
