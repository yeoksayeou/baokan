<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本侵略者的新攻勢</h3>
<p>繼天津事件由地方性問題變成一般性問題，及淪陷品遍地排英運動日益激烈化之後，×人竟又於昨晨拂曉在汕頭大舉豋陸，同時日本海軍又於昨日派兵侵佔浪鼓嶼附近的小島大嶼，並與對岸的中國守兵相互射擊。這確實表現着日本侵略者最近軍事的一種新攻勢。</p>
<p>日本侵略者因為軍事稽久沒有發展，遂有專靠軍事侵略不能達到征服中國的目的的覺悟，遂有一部分經騐較豐富的人們急於結束中日人戰，日本內部遂分成兩派的主張，元老重臣派希望于秋間結束戰爭，想於軍事之外再運用政治的經濟的手腕。少壯派在軍事停頓的無可奈何中，一方面聽任元老重臣派用汪，一方面則更于另一些角度發動事變，威脅第三國。其結果逐也發生及早結束戰爭的作用。日本重性外交此後或有暫時准合為一的可能，但其矛盾則會因這種幻想的不可能而日益增大。</p>
<p>天律事件上，日方所要求的是英國，根本改變遠東政策，帮助日本建議所謂「東亞新秩序」，實則放棄援華的政策反而壓迫中國，以便日本於最近期內，迫我作「城下之盟」。淪陷區各地的反英積極化，更在助長這一種威脅。日軍在汕頭登陸的作用尤為複雜，但仍不外乎這一種新攻勢的進一步的作法。第一，企圖更嚴密封鎖中國的一個重要海口，使內地與海外的交通，更加困難，增加抗戰人心的恐慌：第二，又多擾亂一個英僑的居住地，使英國人心多一層和平的需要；第三，還擴大擾亂及於美法等第三國，使英美法等第三國與中國交界的路線，多一條受到阻碍，以至於完全斷絕。日軍甚至於可能地再在沿海其他的據點，例如福建各處，來幾個騷擾，轟炸與佔領亚進，以加重軍事進攻的新姿勢。</p>
<p>然而，日本軍事的新攻勢對中國的作用小，而對英美法的作用大。全部海岸受到嚴密的封鎖早在未開戰前，我最高車事當局卽已預料到了，我們是要　到內地以與×人作持久戰，×人不能因為封鎖海岸而逼我屈服」，即他們自己也已明白。其主要的原因，仍在擾亂第三國的視聽，困惱第三國人民，特別更進一步包圍香港，使第三國政府特別是英國覺有出頭調停的必要。不過，日本還是在試探，看看英國態度如何，可能地以什麼條件出頭調停。對於這種試探，重要的還是英法美各國泰來援華態度能够繼續堅持下去。一方面，置日方之挑撥與誘惑於不理，一方面，積極準備軍事的對付，如英法會商遠東的軍事合作是非常的重要。這個合作更應該擴大邀請美，暹及荷蘭等關係　家參加。英國能强硬對付，日本紙老虎就不難再被揭穿一角。</p>
<h3>一個模範師的政治教育工作</h3>
<p>— 向榮</p>
<p>（本報特稿）在抗戰的廿三個月來，我們對于部隊中的政治工作，雖然浸有很多的經驗可述，但我想把負有模範師之名的×××師所進行的政治敎育工作，簡要地敘述出來，說明他所採取的敎育方針，敎有的中心內容，實施的原則，以及政治敎育的制度等等，也許可以給各抗戰部隊一些參考。</p>
<p>一　政治教育的總方針</p>
<p>部隊政治敎育的方針是什麽呢？這是很淸楚的，今大全民族共同奮鬥的目標，是為着抗戰，爭取抗戰的最後勝利，完成三民主義的建國；部隊中的政治敎育方針，當然也是為着抗戰，提高部隊的戰鬥力，以爭取戰鬥的更大勝利，達到「抗戰必勝，建國必成」之目的。</p>
<p>『此次抗戰，非一年半載可了，必經非常之困若與艱難、始可獲得最後之勝利、（蔣委員長一九三七年變　節吿民衆書）因此，提在全國抗戰軍隊面前的最基本的問題，便是，如何來提高每個將士的民族覺悟，民族團結，民族信心以鼓勵其殺×的勇氣與决心；以培養其犧牲的精神興艱苦奮鬥的意識；以堅强其勝利不驕傲，失敗時不灰心，百折不撓，萬險不屈的氣概以堅定其「抗戰必勝，建國必成』之信念；使其在最高統帥的堅持持久抗戰方針之下，為中華民族獨立自由解放事業而流　最後的一滴血。</p>
<p>部隊中的政治敎育，便是要以上述的基本方針，來武裝每個抗日戰士的頭腦，使每個戰士，都能成為一個自覺的民族英雄。</p>
<p>二　政治教育的中心內容</p>
<p>根據目前政治敎育的總方針。同時還要計算到培養戰士成為幹部，培養下級幹部成為中上級幹部起見，部隊中的政治敎育的中心內容，我們是依照下述各點進行：</p>
<p>第一，我全中華民族，在今天是一致進行着神聖的民族自衛戰爭，因此，我們必須進行民族解放的敎育。</p>
<p>不錯，××××魔王希特勒，也在大　其大日爾曼民族的民族　義，但我們的民挨主義是與希特勒的民族主義有分別的，『有日本侵掠者與希特勒的愛國主義，有我們的愛國主義。』法西斯蒂是民族　掠主義，我們的民族主義是求中華民族的獨立目由與解放。</p>
<p>民挨解放的敎育中應包括那一些內容呢？</p>
<p>一，民族的覺悟：我們從中國是一種怎樣的國家，日本是怎樣的一種國家說起，說到歷史上日本對於中國的侵　的原因及經過，說到蘆溝橋事變，日本大舉進攻中國的企圖亡我國家，以提高每個戰士的民族覺悟，民挨仇恨（當然只是仇恨日本法西斯軍閥，而不是仇恨日本的勞苦大衆，）以加强每個戰士的殺×勇氣與奮鬥的决心。</p>
<p>二，民族的團結：我們根據着蔣委員長吿國民書「外×不足慮，只要內部團結」的意旨，說明全民族不分階級，不分黨派，不計　仇，不計私怨大家聯合一致抗日的道理，說明軍閥與民衆的關係，友軍與友軍的關係，以及中國人民與日本勞苦大衆的關係；說明三民主義與各種主義的關係，抗戰建國綱嶺之基本國策；同時並說明要嚴防日×及其走狗漢奸×派等陰謀分裂破壞我全民族團結之企圖。</p>
<p>三，民族的信心；我們從中日國力之對比，中日戰爭之性質說明抗戰的最後勝利必屬於我；說明中日戰爭之持久性持久戰之三個階段；說明我國應採取之戰略方針；說明在長期戰爭過程中我有很大的困難，要經過一個很痛苦的時期，必須忍受這個困難，克服這個困難，才能爭取最後的勝利；並說明「戰事已起，惟有拚全民族之生命，犧牲到底，再無中途停頓妥協之理」（蔣委員長廬山談話），堅决反對一切投降妥協之企圖及行動。</p>
<p>第二，我們是軍隊，在今日担負着抗日救國的重大責任的軍隊，因此，我們要進行有關軍隊生活的敎育。</p>
<p>那些是有關軍隊生活的問題呢？</p>
<p>一，為什麼來當兵，為什麽而戰爭？我們根據「國家興亡，匹夫有責」，「當兵是每個國民的神聖天職」，「參加抗日軍，打日本救中國，是我們最光榮的事業」，「不打日本活不成」等等的道理，來說明為什麽來當兵。我們又根據蔣委員長吿國民書中所說：一此次抗戰，為國民革命過桿中所必經，為被侵掠民族對　掠者爭取獨立生存之戰爭，」來說明我們的抗戰是為爭生存，只有抗戰才能避免亡國減植的慘禍並揭穿「抗戰必亡」。一再戰必亡的漢　理論。</p>
<p>二，為什麽要遵守紀律，服從命令？說明為着爭取戰爭的勝利，有賴於上下一致，全體一致，協同動作，遵守紀律，服從命令，就是服從統一動作的號令。同時說明紀律是為着抗戰的利益，為着全民族的利益，因此必須自覺的　守紀律。</p>
<p>三，為什麼要勇　作戰，刻苦耐勞？在戰場上勇敢殺×，在生活上刻苦耐勞，這是每個抗日軍人應具的素質。如果不運樣，那就無法去與兇惡的×人作殘酷的戰爭，更談不上消減×人，戰勝×人。</p>
<p>四，為什麽要劣力學習軍事，政治，文化呢？提高軍事技術，是為着能以最少的犧牲，來爭取更大的勝利：提高政治水平，是為着武裝我們的頭腦，堅定我們奮鬥的信念，提高文化水平，是為着打開我們的眼睛看世界，同時提高文化水平，也帮助軍事政治的學習，這一切還要指明一個目標，就是　着　養自己成為幹部成為更負責的幹部。</p>
<p>五，為什麼要團結友愛？部隊中千千萬萬的人，雖然有來目南方，有來自北方，有鬥爭歷史長久的，有新近　加部隊的，千萬人，人各一面；但我們為抗日救國，千萬人大家一心。因針要發揚同志問的團結的友愛，不打罵，不爭吵，共患難，同甘苦，疾病相扶持，有過相規諫。</p>
<p>六，為什麼要與居民打成一片？軍隊是民衆的武力，是為人民服務的，同時要戰勝×人，非軍民親密團結，動員民衆一致　戰不可。因此重隊必須親近民衆，帮助民衆，不擾　，不害民。</p>
<p>七，為什麽要爭取×軍，優待×軍俘虜呢？，因為日本軍隊的士兵，以及偽軍中的大部分官兵，都是被迫來侵略中國的；他們與日本軍閥的利益是必處於對立的地位。因此，我們要爭取×偽軍中的下級官兵，使他們覺悟過來，站在打倒日本軍閥的地位，與中國人民携手合作。爭取偽×軍的工作，除一般的政治宣傳以外，優待×偽　俘虜，是一種很好的辦法。</p>
<p>第三，我們的抗戰，不僅是驅逐日×出中國，同時也是為建立三民主義新中國的光明前途。因此，我們　要三民主義的理論敎育，以及先進的科學思想的敎育。</p>
<p>有一些什麽具體的內容呢？除了上面已經說到過的以外，我們還有關於三民主義的敎育，中國近代革命運動史的敎育，和社會科學常識的敎育，政治經濟學和新哲學的教育等等。</p>
<p>第四，因為部隊中的文化水平比較低，同時文化知識與軍事政治敎育有密切的聯繫，因此，我們需要進行文化敎育。</p>
<p>過去曾　有過道種不完全的認識以為文化敎育只是識字敎育，同時也有這種不妥當的觀念，以為文化敎育與　樂工作聯繫在一起，叫做文化娛樂工作，所以把文化敎育也認為是一種與娛樂工作差不多的東西，而輕視了文化敎　的重要，把它當作是一種輔助敎育來看待。這些觀點，我們都給了它以指正。</p>
<p>文化敎肯是包括那些內容呢？我們認為：識字敎育自然在文化敎育中佔着主要的地位，但不能包括文化敎育的全部，此外尙有自然科學的敎育，地理歷史的敎育，算術的敎育等。</p>
<p>第五，以上這些基本敎育，但不能包括臨時發生的一些事時問題，因此，我們需要關於時事方面的教育。</p>
<p>有些什麼臨時的時事問題？如：</p>
<p>一，大的戰鬥的政治動員；</p>
<p>二，全國各地抗戰戰况的分柝；</p>
<p>三，紀念日的意義；</p>
<p>四，以及部隊中臨時發生某某些不良傾向的糾正等等。</p>
<p>以上這些問題的解釋與敎育，是根據　總的敎育方針來推行的。不過它沒有編入，也不可能編入在基本敎育的敎村裏面，所以列在時事問題的敎育以內。</p>
<p>三　對於實施政治教育的要求</p>
<p>有了政治敎育總的方針，有了政治敎育的中心內容，接若的問四便是對於實施政治敎育的要求，也就是對於實施政治敎育的原則問題。我們的原則是下面四個。</p>
<p>第一，少而精</p>
<p>什麽叫做少，是否我們只簡單的要求懂得一個或幾個基本問題就算了呢？不是的。我們要求要懂得的問題有相當的多，有軍事的，有政治的，有文化的，有基本的理論。（未完）</p>

<h3>本報特約通信　羅浮行（八）</h3>
<p>— 流螢</p>
<p>早上八點鐘，獨嶺坳炮聲發作了，接着串炮竹般的機槍聲從我們這邊發出，梁營長親自到酥醪覜來，對我們說：「×人上我們的大當，前線已發現×步炮兵共二千餘，我們呢？老實說，只有一連人在這裏，但，我們可以抵抗到十二點，請　們向橫河那邊去。」我們叠了衣服，離開酥醪觀，道士們淸靜的氣氛給炮聲衝破了，他們也緊張起來。沿途都有民衆的隊伍，他們三五担家私，便有一根槍跟着各顧各逃命，這是太不應該了。如果這些武裝組織起來，相信×兵是不敢來這裏的。</p>
<p>我們向山路行進，炮聲從遠而近，有幾個炮彈掠過我們頭上，在不遠的田段上爆炸。咯咯的機槍聲對着敵人怒叫。</p>
<p>驟雨掩護着我們離開了火綫綫，午十二時，我們到了橫河。囘望羅浮山的北面，黑烟冒出，侵略者的火又在延燒了。次日得到消息，謂酥醪村被燒民星八十餘間。我軍民無損失。</p>

<h3>飛躍進展中之西南鑛冶事業　政府修正法規鼓勱外人投資　資源委會策動各方戮力推進</h3>
<p>我國礦產，煤鐵之外，以銻錫鎢鉛等較為重要，煤鐵主要礦區，不幸都在淪陷區內；獨銻錫鎢銅等之產地，偏於西南一帶；故有南方特產金屬之稱，自抗戰以還，朝野人士，羣知開發西南為抗戰時期建國之重要工作，因之礦冶事業之建設，不遺餘力；茲略其發展現勢如下：</p>
<p>修訂礦業法規</p>
<p>政府為開發西南礦業起見，首先修正礦業法規，准許外人投資，並訂定國營礦區管理規程，設立礦冶研究所等，（甲）礦冶研究所設下列各組：（一）採購組研究採礦工程技術，及調杳礦產礦場等事項；（二）選礦組，研究選礦及洗煤技術等事項；（三）冶鍊組，研究銅鐵或金屬非金屬之冶鍊技術；燃料之開發利用及　杳冶鍊塲等事項；（四）化驗組，化驗研究各種礦冶產品及其附屬物品等事項，各組設主任一人主持之。（乙）國營礦區之經營方式，分下列各項辦法：（一）由經濟部直接管理；（二）委託其他中央官署管理；（三）出租國營礦區，得與省政府合辦；惟經濟部或其他中央宮署，所占資本不得少於百分之五十，依礦業法准許外人入股者，經濟部或其他中央官署所占資本，不得少於百分之三十四；（四）礦業納稅辦法，有正常理由，兩年內未施工者，得免徵之、（丙）準許外人投資：礦業法規定準許外國人入股，合組股份有限公司，經營礦業、但應由經濟部核定並受下列限制：（一）公司股份總額過半數，應由中華民國人所有（二）公司董事過半數應為中華民國人民，（三）公司董事長及總經理等職，應由中華民國人充任，但不得將礦業權移轉于外國人，登記後二年內不開工，或中途停工一年以上者，應卽撤消礦業權</p>
<p>礦務採冶現況</p>
<p>自礦業法現公布後，經濟部資源委員會以及各省政府，卽積極進行；茲將各種礦產採冶之現况之分誌如下：（甲）鎢鑛砂可供鍊鋼及製電燈泡中，鋼絲，又為軍械製造必之需品，世界產量甚少；惟中國獨厚，自經國府實施統制管理後，輸出總額，逐漸增加，產鎢之處為江西廣東湖南廣西福建等省，尤以江西為最豐富，常佔全國產額百分之九十五以上，佔世界　產額百分之三十六，現產鎢各省，均已成立鎢業管理處，市價由管理處公佈，統一輸出，嚴禁走私；戰前每担約國幣五十元，戰後國外鎢業高漲，收買價卽漲至一百元；香港洋行收買價則至二百元以上，鎢砂輸出，民國二—三年僅六、三一五、三四九元，二十六年　至四〇、七五八、五九二元；二十七年首八月亦達三八·五一八、八〇八元、輸往國以德佔第一，美第二，英第三，戰後國府曾將鎢產出口權給予福公司；最近資源委員會，决定自採自銷自用原則，並於各產區之管理處內設技術組，求生產合理化及經濟化，並籌設選鎢廠選練。（乙）鐵為工業主要原料，中國產鐵雖富，惟以尙無高熱度鎔　爐，故熟鐵產量，未能普遍供給，漢口未失陷前，各地需要生鐵，大多由漢口六河溝生鐵公司供給，武漢放棄後，生鐵來源，頓感缺乏，因此鐵價飛漲，每噸已由三百餘元漲至七百餘元。經濟部調整處，已在川設立鍊鐵廠；購備鎔鐵力每日十　之高熱度鎔爐一座，其生鐵在武漢放棄前，巳設法運出一千餘噸，同時積極籌劃開發新　、據專家測量、西康冕寗縣屬之濾沽一地，藏鐵達八千萬噸。此外天全榮經藏鐵量，自今年一月起，每月可產四五百噸；將來濾定在全等地，擴大生產，每年可產鐵十數萬噸。其餘西南各省之鐵礦　量約三千九百六十一萬六千噸。故嗣後民間所需熟鐵，當可逐漸以達自給之目的。（丙）政府為扶助錫之發展，由資源委員會籌設一完備之公司，從事採洗煉等工作，資本總額為六百萬元，同時由滇省政府與富滇新銀行合組貿易協會辦理筒舊錫之輸出，以後直接由蒙自輸出口、不再由香港複煉而後輸出。中國錫之產地，幾全在西南各省；雲南居第一位，年產約九千頓。佔全國產額百分之八十八。廣西次之，年產約三百噸；湖南更次之，年產約九十噸；廣東則不過五十噸，四省錫產合計約九千四百噸、是項產品、大半均　往國外；近年更有突飛猛進之勢，其輸出價值常在國幣三千萬以上，居全國對外輸出品之第七位，至於全國　　產錫，則居世界錫產國家第五位，（丁）銅為電業材料中最主要者，應用極廣，純銅可製電車電話電報之傳電綫及其他工業用機械，銅與鋅之合金，稱為黃銅，製造螺絲釘圓桿時計　件槍彈殼等，全國銅礦區為　南四川湖北等省，面積共四百七直六萬公畝，雲南東川銅鑛，為我國產銅最多之區，今由資源委員會與滇省府合辦滇北　務局，辦理該省北部諾礦，並將東川全部資產，作為政府投資之一部份、四川彭縣銅鑛、為我國第二銅鍍，今由資源委員會派昌開工，該鑛儲量，據化平地質調査所估計、約為十萬餘噸，（壬）銻為　南省富有之鑛產　　佔全國百分之九十九，全省產量得一萬七千七百五十三噸，佔全世界產量百分之八十七以上，新化錫鑛山益陽板溪等地，開採最盛，安化邵　沅陵新謂等處次之，雲南廣西貴州諸省又次之，最近貴州三合縣有銘新民生等公司，開採鑛，產量不多，貴州鑛務局正在進行中。</p>

<h3>波蘭的海與北歐　英蘇談判癥結之剖視（上）</h3>
<p>— 董平</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>自四月裏起，英蘇談判就成了報紙上的大字新聞，可是，一天又一天，停停復停停，談談重談談，三月麥，蘇聯已提過兩次建議，英國也送過三次方案——最近傳說英國又送新方案，那便成四次了，蘇聯外長李維諾夫，也不幸丟了官——但是，『英蘇談判業吿完成』的字樣仍舊不能在報上見到。</p>
<p>前天，張伯倫在下院答覆質問，說：『英蘇談判仍有若干焦點，這些焦點中，最重要，而且，最引人注意的，自然便是波羅的海諸國的保證問題，蘇聯咬定了屢保證這幾個小國，英國則表示大可不必那幾個小國家自己，却也嚷起來：『我們自會保守中立，不勞你們保設』。</p>
<p>爲什麽波羅的海問題，會鬧得這樣糟呢，這里，且提供一點剖開來的事實。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>首先我們且看一看，蘇聯爲什麽一定要自吿奮勇，去保證波羅的海諸國</p>
<p>這，根本不是政治上或外交上的問題，而完全是一個軍事上的技術問題。</p>
<p>現在，我們且打開歐洲的地圖，看到波羅的海及北歐一帶。</p>
<p>我們都知道，蘇聯是個道地的大陸國家，數百年來，她都在開拓海口上用工夫，但到現在，能够適用的軍港，仍只有兩個，亞洲的海參威與波羅的海芬蘭灣，而波羅的海這個港口，尤爲重要，蘇聯的歐洲艦隊，便是集中在那兒的。</p>
<p>可是，如果，眞正分析起來，波羅的海，實在是一所死海，它只有一條出路——北海，因此，它的命運，事實上是受制於北海上的勢力。</p>
<p>這事實，在上次大戰中，業已表現出來，所以，和會之中，規定波羅的海沿岸的德境，撤騷軍事設備，德國與丹麥間的基爾運河，及丹麥與瑞典間的頌德海峽，均開放國際通航，禁止設防。</p>
<p>可是，希特勒上台之後，和約已成了廢紙，波羅的海沿岸的德境，早置下了大砲，基爾運河也在積極開拓和架高橋，以便通過德國最大的巡洋艦，而位在北海，控制着基爾運河西口的黑爾哥蘭島，大戰之後，也在撤廢設防之列的，現在又成了德國的海軍根據地了。</p>
<p>丹麥德國只隔一道運河，納粹的毒刀，是無法抗拒的，因此，不但基爾運河管理權已完全入德國之乎，就是丹麥西境，遙對英國的一面，也被逼着安置下德國的大炮了，這意思就是說：英國海軍，請不要過來。</p>
<p>不止此也，德國在波羅的海及北歐的伸張，愈來愈兇了，他向北歐四國要求簽訂不侵犯條約，雖然碰了軟釘子，但，他决不會歛跡，現在已經在慫恿麥丹，要在瑞丹間的頌德海峽設防，這一點，瑞典自然竭力反對，不過，瑞典雖然是一個努力反納粹的國家，但是，她到底是一個小國，如果沒有別人實力作後盾，早晚是會屈服在卍字旗下，如果不幸瑞典屈服，頌德海峽設下了防，成了德國的天下，那麽，波羅的海中的蘇聯艦隊，就會輸一下悶在里面了。</p>
<p>再向東去，便是美米爾，一夜工夫，希特助使把它拿了囘去，那里是一個良好的深水港；德國正準備在那里建立潛水艇根據地，這對於蘇聯艦隊，在波羅的海逗留，實在是無上的威脅。</p>
<p>自美米爾，再向北，便是亞蘭羣島，又是一個重要的地方，這個島介於瑞典與芬蘭之間，一九二一年，雙方約定，該島永爲中立，不設防，但是，到了今年一月，時勢所逼，兩國也决定在那兒設起防來了。</p>
<p>這動作，自然是對德國在美米爾活動的一個抵抗，但，希特勒毫不在乎，反在報上大加宣揚，這意思便是說：你先設好防，過兩天，我拿來用。</p>
<p>無疑的，在下一次大戰中，亞蘭羣島，是德蘇必爭之地，而且，誰攫有了它，誰就有稱覇波羅的海的希望。</p>
<p>波羅的海中，這些轉變，都是令蘇聯挺頭疼的事。但是，蘇聯决不會束手待斃的，她也有她的手法。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>美國調解津案</h3>
<p>天津事件是日×有計劃的反英運動，也是有計劃的向英國嚇詐的行動，因此在這次行動中，對於美國，力求擺脫任何牽涉，不惜頻頻暗送秋波。</p>
<p>然而事實上不論英國採取妥協或是抵抗政策，事件的結果，都不能不影響到美法各國，却是無法否定的，更具體的說，就是日×對天津租界的進攻，實際上也就包括對於美國在遠東勢力的作用在內。英美在遠東的利害雖存有若干矛盾，但是自從日×侵略氣焰高騰以來，以至今後日×勢力獲得縱容之後，則英美利害卽已在大體上趨於一致，就是不免因日×勢力的發展而共同被迫退出遠東。</p>
<p>目前英國的外交政策，不僅在遠東，卽在全世界，××××××，而美國的政策則相反的，日益取得决定的意義了。因此，我們不想驚奇於英國政府之竟然採取「息事寧人」政策，我們却要注意美國之如何傳出『調解津案』的消息！我們相信，美國是不會陷入日×的陰謀的，但我們更祈望着美國的積極態度，必能同時推促帮助英國民衆推促其政府共同積極起來！</p>

<h3>加拿大學生五女觀光記</h3>
<p>五個小寶貝</p>
<p>五年前，加拿大安里奧省加闌特地方，一個窮苦不堪的農家裏，發生了奇蹟，一個婦人，一胎生下了五個女孩，這家人原來已有了八九個孩子，其中有兩對是攀生的，忽然又加上這五個小東西，小得出奇，眞使他們望書發愁。幸虧被一個鄉村醫生達福發覺了，他深信用科學的方法，能養活這五個小東西，幾經他奔走呼籲，結果由安里奧省議會出面，將她們「收歸國有」。在加蘭特地方設立了一所養育院，專門養育這五個小孩，院中的一切都由達福醫生主持。</p>
<p>我們抵達加蘭特已經快十點鐘了，這是一個很小的市鎭，五胞胎未出世之前。它利外間簡直不發生絲毫關係，但是，現在却因爲來往的遊客很多，也就新修了幾條崎嶇不平的黄泥公路，四鄉的人民，樸實非凡，地方上也不像富庶之區，却不料福　天降，憑空的就名震全球。</p>
<p>養育院招待外界的時間，每日兩次。上午十一時至十二時；下午也只開放一小時；將近養育院的地方，有一家出售紀念品的小店，這是曾幫助五胞胎出世的接生婆開設的。這產婆接到了這五個小寶貝，也沾上了光，來賺幾文。</p>
<p>聽說每天利院里去探望這五位小姑娘的，着寶不在少數，總上千，有的是初次去看，也有一而冉，再而三去看的，無非都是爲要滿足好奇心，帶些紀念物囘去的，也不少。店裏出售的都是些畫像照片之類，這位達福醫生早年會寫過一本『育兒法』，現在也在小店裏寄售，每本上還有作者的親筆簽名，人們的心理，一定以爲他旣救活了一個五胞胎，對子育兒的方法，當然特別高明，其實，這本書在以前並無人顧問，自從他一鳴驚人之後，世界聞名的科學家，醫學家都和他會談起來，經過多次的公開演講，現在就公認他是專家了。</p>
<p>至於那五個小女孩，已經拍過了兩部影片，獲得三十五萬元的酬報。此外、美國和加拿大的大工廠，大公司，尤其是製造兒童食用物品的，都爭先恐後的來利用幾們作廣吿，這上面，少不了又是一筆大收入。這些財　，使她們的窮　爸眼紅的很，懊悔當初將所有　讓給了政府，他曾一再向省議會要求收囘親機，可是，和政府打官司，如何勝得了？結果他還是要等他的姑娘們滿了十八歲，才能收歸私有。現在他仍　只能住在離養育院不遠的一所小而陳舊的房子　。</p>
<p>我們到院門口時，已經有幾百人站在大太陽底下等候開門了。這是一所木板建造的平房，規模不很大，剛够她們五個小孩和待從們居住。房子的四週。有大片的空地。稀疏的栽種些樹木花草，泥土都是黄紅色，空場的四圍，　善很高的　絲網，是禁止閒人闖進去的，鐵絲網外面散佈着幾個武裝的保　，戒備森嚴，　然要人的府邸，大門開啓了，人們一個一個挨序而進。有一個計數機，就和參觀動物園一般的計着人數；走進木房，是一個圓形的走廊，走廊朝　的一面，是一層很學的紗窻，紗　的裏面，是兩層玻璃窗，從紗窗和圾璃窗中看出去，看見的是一座院子，院子中間有五個小池塘。那五個童話裏的小公主，正在太陽裏頑要，因爲院子　光線明亮，走廊裏比較黑暗，所以我們大衆的目光一致注射在她們身上，她們却看不見我們。否則，看見這許多人還繞着，免不了要吃驚；這樣對於她們的心理敎育是不相宜的，養育院當局不許觀衆發出一點聲息，看的人　多，可以站　張望的地位就顯得很少了，管理的人，又不許覩衆稍事留速，不斷的催我們沿走廊的半圈向前移動，因爲外面還有許多人等着要進來。在這種情形之下，想仔細的觀察，猶如登天，只能看見五個小女孩，在太陽底下　球，弄沙，翻筋斗。她們都穿着白鞋白襪，却穿着顏色不同的小短褲，上身全裸露着，戴着和衣服同色的寬邊帽兒。看上去都很肥碩，也很伶俐。偶或跌了一交，自已爬起來就了事，並不哇哇大哭。看　婦端了一大缸橘子汁出來，分給每個小孩一杯，穿淺紫色衫的小孩　似乎不愛吃，將杯于推開，只顧着玩，穿黄衣的走過去，將她抓囘來，押若她吃；穿粉紅的却吃完了一杯，還嫌不够，伸着小手要添。我們一邊跟着大衆繞圈子，一邊釘着那五個小動物看個不了。等繞出了門，一看有人看過了又重新進去再看，我們也就如法泡製了一下。直到看得心滿意足，才興盡而返。</p>
<p>這次英皇夫婦，巡幸加拿大在五月二十二日那天，五個小玩意兒和英皇夫婦會了面，據說由達福醫生領導着，向英皇興后行了敬禮之後，又向皇后獻花，接吻玩得挺對勁的　　自然，决不會像下面盡的那樣糟。</p>
<p>加拿大攣生五女謁駕記</p>
<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>這個託爾斯泰，不是俄國大作家，而是他的　先，託爾斯泰伯爵。</p>
<p>一天，伯爵和一批朋友在等候沙皇，候了許久，大家有點不耐煩了。這年靑的伯爵就摹仿起沙皇的樣子來，做得維妙維肖，使大家不斷的　笑。突然間笑聲停止了，伯爵囘頭一看，沙皇已自後面走進來了。</p>
<p>「做下去！」沙皇嚴厲的咆哮着。</p>
<p>託爾斯泰沒有辦法，只好做。他鞠了個躬，然後做出一偶尊嚴的手勢，摹仿舊沙皇的聲調說：</p>
<p>『託爾斯泰，你　敢摹　朕，本應嚴辦，姑念汝年幼無知，且赦汝此次無罪，下次再犯，必當加倍處罰。』</p>
<p>沙皇聽了大笑，寬恕了他。託爾斯泰</p>
<h3>氣象臺</h3>
<p>昨晨×軍，突在汕頭登陸，我軍照例予以堅强抵抗。×當局公報竟謂：「華軍扺抗之强，出乎意料之外。」笑話。跌進了沼泥，自然也是意料之外。</p>
<p>天津事件，英國以和平爲原則，息事　人，準備就他解决。不過，日本的旗，是愈扯愈兇，仍在要求「根絕」。諺云，　　　　　　　人，這里，且看應不應？</p>
<p>衛生當局昨天發表一文，籲請居民根絕肺癆，苦口婆心，實在可佩，文內說：</p>
<p>去年一年，患肺病者，約五萬人：死的達五千人。大半都是貧民，因爲住房太小，空氣不暢，飲食缺乏滋養……於是乎，　于傳染。</p>
<p>當局建議大家把房住好一點，吃好一點。如果，再要生肺病，　就去住醬院，慢慢療治，願居民聽聯這句說，而述到住洋房，吃大菜，快快活活。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>巴爾幹半島，有個極小的王國，一天，國務卿請客，客人中有個外交官走來吿訴主人說：　在我左面的，貴國司法總長，趁我和別人談話的當兒，將我袋里的表拿去了。」</p>
<p>「唉！這眞太不對了」，主人很不好意思地說，『我可以替你追還。』</p>
<p>果然，宴罷時。主人對錶送還了。</p>
<p>『他可曾說甚　？』客人問，</p>
<p>『輕點！』主人望了旁邊一眼，『他還不知道呢，我趁他在和別人談話時，替你拿囘來了，』</p>
<h3>雨花</h3>
<p>女主人：你知道嗎？我疑惑少爺跟那個女打字員有點曖昧　事呢！</p>
<p>俏女僕：我不相信，你說這記不過是想使我妒忌罷了。</p>
<p>舉生：今天是幾號？先生！</p>
<p>先生：不必寫了。時候不早，快交卷罷。</p>
<p>學生：可是，我想我的考卷上，親要寫上點東西才好呢！</p>
<p>男：我可以吻一下你的手麽？</p>
<p>女：不過對於我拉開面慕要比脫手套容易些呢。</p>
<h3>海上風雲　十一</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述</p>
<p>一九一四年秋，德輪「　降柏齊號」，載着六百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯　公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾也趁這　去遊歷歐洲。在船上　克代理無線電工作時，接着個怪消息，說英德宣戰了。英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便無月的地狂奔起來，不久，無線電中又傳來附近有冰山的消息。旅客要求減低速力，船長不肯，幸虧冰不久便滑過去了，但是旅客却受驚得失常了…</p>
<p>「胡說！」有人叫着，「我們撞到了一座冰山，我們會沉死啦。」</p>
<p>「小船！」一個男人聲大叫，「我們自己來放下它，我們已經在往下沉啦！」</p>
<p>在暗處，傑克能看見這人的臉，白自胖胖的，有一大攆黄郁郁子，這人排開了兩個婦人，將她　擠到一邊去。自己竄到前面來，正對着傑克所站的地方。</p>
<p>「讓我過去，你！」他咆哮着；看起來，他似乎驚恐得變瘋狂了，「我要第一隻船上的位子，我，——」</p>
<p>傑克覺到比爾塞了一柄手鎗在他袋里，但是，他不就動它，這時候用它還未免太早一點。</p>
<p>『不要吵，一他向那黄鬍子人粗魯的說。又調轉口氣，『先生，太太們，沒有危險了，我們不過稍爲擦到一點，天保佑，這船已脫險了。』</p>
<p>「別信他的。」那個　橫無理的人號叫着，『站開去。救生艇！』</p>
<p>他使勁向傑克一衝，同時舉手重重的打來，但是，傑克窺着他的拳頭近身時，一蹲身躱過了。立刻也揮出老拳，如法奉　，這人吃着一拳，</p>
<p>蹌蹌的向後跌去，却是倒不下去，因爲四面都被人擠掌住了。</p>
<p>若是在這些人中間，竟沒有一個頭腦淸楚點的，這就很難說，會鬧出怎麽一囘事來了，傑克的冷靜態度，給了他們一點保證，這許多胆小的人們，開始鎭靜了一點，也就在這時候，船長洛克率領實幾個船員趕來，都帶着手槍，因爲在紛亂的情形之下，恐怕無秩序的衝突起來　會將一些婦女擠壓踐踏，鬧出人命來。</p>
<p>船主堅强冷靜的，氣。正跟　克和比爾所表現的一樣，他向旅客們保證。方才已經　察過了，船身幷沒有　傷，他幷且允許，以後將用　種止常的速度航行。這些受驚的羣衆，才　次的退下去，有些囘到艙裏去了，還有一大部份人，仍留在甲板上過夜。</p>

<h3>麥業注意防止　以外匯洋麥運日　傳聞半年來運日二千餘萬包　假借名義以法幣調外匯購進</h3>
<p>自中日戰事發生、沿江各地因戰略上關係、換取日方大量消耗後、卽自動放案、致素稱農產饒富之區、相繼倫陷、內地各項主要出產、日方利用其特殊暴力、非法統制、而尤以小麥一項、搜括更厲、去年沿江一帶之小麥被日方</p>
<p>偷運出口者、數量頗鉅、以致華商各麵粉購原料缺乏、不得不訂購大批洋麥接濟、據金融界方面報吿、自去年十一月份起、至本年三月底止、上海與天兩海關僅就洋麥一項進口數值、達七千五百餘萬元、已見前報、本年</p>
<p>三月份後、迄今雖未有詳細統計、但輸人數値、當屬可觀、國府為顧全工商業之必需原料起見、對購麥申請外匯、均予核準、雖在長期抗戰之中、仍竭力維持後方之生產事業、足見關心民　、培養生息、無微不至、詎日方竟勾結不肖奸商、企圖將日方由內地</p>
<p>搜括法幣、假用華商廠家名義、向財政部申請外匯後、訂購洋麥、運往日本、爲製粉原料、且外間傳聞、自去年十一月中至平年四月、運往日本之洋麥、數値二千餘　元、均由中國法幣換取外匯而訂購該業公會已特予注意、加以防止矣、</p>

<h3>火的行列</h3>
<p>— 山蒂</p>
<p>窄狹的行人道上，麻麻密密的行人依序地排成一條來的，一條去的。一眼看去，人們擠擾得像海上捲起了千堆如雪的怒潯。把道路擠得太緊紥了，人一個個的被擠到馬路中間來。</p>
<p>特別是最熱鬧馬路的轉角和中古式的守更樓的梯級上，人們更是密集得像天上的星星。他們並沒行動，兀自伸長了頸項的佇立着。</p>
<p>茶館也早塞滿了各行色的人，樓上更是擁擠得沒有一座之地；臨馬路的一排矮窗戶，承受了一大堆人的靠附，他們在瞭望，在瞭望這古的名山城的空前大熱鬧，盛大的一幕。</p>
<p>一片嘈雜的鼓號聲，歡欣聲，終於穿過黑黝的長空，播送得由遠而近了，人們又是一陣喧擾的蠕動，像惟恐他們的位置由好的變成壞的似的。</p>
<p>偉大的火的行列，由於交響的軍樂在前引啓，莊嚴，熱烈，肅穆地走近來了。像一條閃耀液萬丈光芒的粗巨的火龍，蜿蜓，漫長，冉冉地在運動。……</p>
<p>强烈的火焰，在人羣，房屋，牌坊，樹議，……的表皮，塗上了一層波動的鮮艷的赤紅。</p>
<p>頭前，一幅巨大的浮露著勝利的微笑的領袖的畫像，承着幾蓋白亮的煤氣燈的照射，使佇立着觀望的人們不能不肅然地生敬。巨像似在吿示我們，他已經看見勝利的光焰了，他鼓勵我們依着他的指使，邁上光明成功的路。</p>
<p>排列在巨像旁邊的是兩個長方形的大燈籠，從里面射出的白光把，面上的念的：「昆明市靑年運動火炬大遊行」顯現愈發淸楚。</p>
<p>在鮮紅的火炬耀照下行進的有：大學生，童子軍，小學生，兵士，職業團體的代表。……他們挺直了胸膛，合齋了步伐，為掀起羣衆的情感而驚天的嘶喊，為祖國的勝利而醒人的歌唱。把悲觀，消極，敗北的氣氛掃蕩得絲毫不留。</p>
<p>驀地走來了一隊黃黑色皮膚，陌生的臉色的「華僑機工囘國服務團」，高大的個子，劃一的軍服。擎起了每個都在狂燃的火炬。他不大會歌唱，但他們愈用他們的方言，把他們集壓深久了的憎恨，忿怒，從心胸的深處，擠洩出更洪大，更響亮的警語。每一句捷短的開始，他們情不自禁地用力把旗幟突地舉高，把火焰的整齊線的光波在他們的頭頂上抬起。</p>
<p>不再有什麽顧慮，他們暢快的做了好久就要想做的，動人的呐喊，發狂的動作，使觀望的人們興奮得驚駭，浩嘆，色舞，眉飛；恨不得加入他們的一羣，永隨着他們去戰鬥，耶務，生活。</p>
<p>煞尾，一羣征募隊的隊員，不憚麻煩的沿着路的兩邊向行人道上的羣衆殷勤的勸募。感動了這剛受着新鮮的强度的刺激的一羣，雖然是老婆子，苦力們。也慨然地從他們的身上檢出僅有的幾張鈔票，交給征募的隊員。隨着，募到不少花花緣綠的紙幣。</p>
<p>幾個隊員，興奮的愉快着，發出憨笑。……</p>
<p>囘到了廣場，動作都停止了，讓無數的火炬拋在一堆，熊熊的狂燃，火舌直紙吻了黯黑的無際的夜空。人們暢地地洩出最後的呼號，走了。</p>
<p>大堆的烈火，還在熱心地，毫不吝惜地發出刺眼的搖曳的紅光。……</p>

<p>這想必是敵機一個禮拜前狂炸這裏的情果吧，這裏防空壕頗多，絕不像成都的毫無防空設備，但惜防空壞均頗不堅牢耳。馬路上黃色車很多，都漂亮極了，比上海，廣州，香港的都漂亮得多，初以為是私家包車，不敢叫；後來才知道就是普通的黃包車；車費較上海的略實些。也常見轎子，有點像廣東鄉下轎子，頗精緻，比較從重慶到寧羌這一段路程上所見的，只用繩子把竹片紮成像一把躺椅子，用繩子吊下一塊大些的竹片作為踏脚之用的，沒有轎萱，也沒有轎門的轎子，又好像是進步了一個世界了。現在華北的同胞，似仍繼續向華西移動，故經過這裏的人頗多，因此，交通也更感困難，生活程度也高起來。沒有電燈（自來水更不用說），點火油燈。故市民晚上大概很早麼。入夜九時，就夜闌人靜，一切俱寂，但聞「一二三四，一二三四」雄亮的歌聲，和「起來，不願做奴隸的人們……」等慷慨激昂的救亡歌曲的歌聲，由遠而近，淸晰傳來。翌晨，在晨光熹微的寒霧中，這種歌聲和喊聲，又淸晰地傳來了，躺在床裏細聽着，自己的身體也一陣比一陣的温熱起來了。</p>
<p>八、漢寶路上懷往事</p>
<p>晨四時就記床，在星光下叫手車夫推行李至車站，在擁擠得黑漆一團的人叢中，搶買到車票，爬上無蓬的大卡軍，心裏感到幸得趕程的滿足。（未完）</p>
<h3>不退却</h3>
<p>— 會兆筠</p>
<p>三月十五日那晚，砲火非常利害，剛剛圓的月亮，也被震動得不住地晃動，大霧山的叢林，沙沙的在饗，樹幹上春天的樹葉，像染滿了鮮紅的血。</p>
<p>山脚下，俯伏着一匹被炸彈撕破了的碉樓，碉樓，裏面和四周，都堆滿了互相叠倚的沙包，戰士們探出來的頭顱，組得像潔漢的面。</p>
<p>一架重機關槍，搖擺著沉重的腦袋覷着×人，它正格格地在笑嗎。</p>
<p>「啊喲！」一顆尖尖的子彈，流星似的穿過了機槍手的背，慘叫一聲便歪倒在一邊，但另一個勇士立刻很敏捷地爬來。替代犧牲者的職務。</p>
<p>「同志，你怎麽樣？」排長用來掩緊傷者的創口，阻住奔流而美麗的血，低低地問。</p>
<p>「不怎樣！你快拿槍口對準×人吧！我們得再見，「死」是平常的。」垂死的人，口角掛着微笑。</p>
<p>碉樓的上唇，斜斜地露出小鋼砲的嘴。領下掛着一撮綠油油的樹葉，像鬍子哩，因為×人的飛機太瘋狂了，兄弟們把它改成高射砲用，砲手全身涂着土敏土的地板，擦亮的鋼盔的陰影下，正放着一本很厚的書，砲手的腮鼓動着，在唸。</p>
<p>沉重的馬達聲漸漸地近了，無限的太空。嵌上了三盞動的紅燈，品字形疾捷地斜飛，砲手把手中的書一丟，那家伙便跟着響了，眞是好家伙呵，一陣紅光，撞碎了黑沉沉的空氣，三盞紅燈立刻熄滅，中間盪漾者可愛的火花，馬達聲漸漸地遠了，厚厚的書又重重回到砲手鋼盔的陰影下，唸着！</p>
<p>大霧山的背脊，山勢非當險峻，而且滿山長着靑苔，很像一頂綠色的大禮帽，一匹在山麓下逡巡的坦克車，似乎望見山的半腰有×人在埋伏着，便巔簸地，吃力地向上爬，攏近一看，原來是一排草紮的兵馬，坦克軍頓着後脚，非常氣怒，正遲疑間，忽然從山巔傳下一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>「蠢東西，上來玩玩吧！」距離坦克車的一百碼，筆挺地站立着一個灰布制服的哨兵，左臂已受了傷，但「抗戰」的快樂使他忘記什麽是創傷，什麽是痛苦，他在笑着喊着。</p>
<p>坦克車追上去，我們的哨兵繞着山道跑，有時用一株倒了的大樹，阻住去路，使「它」仰面朝天的翻一個身，有時在「它們的股屁打上兩槍，坦克車的機槍在怒吼若，但只擊倒突出的巖石和靑翠的樹木。</p>
<p>如是支持了兩點多鐘，哨兵的腿跑得有點酸，從斜坡跳下仰臥着休息、但那「蠢東西」還不斷地團團亂轉，它巨大的心在想：「×人巳消滅了，我得玩個痛快。」</p>
<p>這是一營忠勇的戰士，因抵抗侵略而在劣勢的情形底下相强盜週旋的幾口，他們的人數雖由三百多減到百餘個，然而他們不屆不撓的精神，却一天比一天偉大。後面的路雖巳截斷，但假若他們肯把槍桿放下，是可以繞道退入相界的，不過他們不肯；他們說：「槍」是軍人的生命！國家的生命！四高萬五千萬同胞的生命！」</p>
<p>「各位兄弟，」就是三月十五那晚，營長站起來對大家說，「今晚突然接到上峯的命令，叫我們退却——退入相界，解除武裝，受人保護！大家的意見怎麽樣？願意？還是不願意？」</p>
<p>「不願意！我們打下去！」一陣雄壯的吼聲！</p>
<p>「我們的兄弟巳經死了這麽多，我們大家一同死在這兒！」又是一陣巨大的共鳴。</p>
<p>「兄弟們！旣然大家的意見都是「不肯退」，我們就得繼續打！打呀！打呀！大霧山是「我們的」，碉樓是「我們的！」營長揚着左手，興奮地大叫。</p>
<p>三月十五的月亮，又漸漸地和人間辭別了，太空仍是一樣紅血，戰爭仍奮確續開展。</p>
<h3>落在生活後面</h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>文學是站在社會生活的前頭的，「落在生活後面」，這在一個特定的文學運動或是一個特定的作家底創作實踐上，無疑是一種重大的缺點。在古往今來許多形式的文學運動之中，文學都是作爲生活的寫照，作為生活的反映而參加於整個社會的發展鬥爭的，如其有那麽一部作品，或是有那麽一個作家，它不能伴隨着社會生活變化發展而向前，却遠遠的落在生活的後面，那它就將游離於整個的文學遝動社會運動之外，成為文學的渣滓。</p>
<p>一個最能够描寫社會上活的鬥爭底作家，他不僅是從暗中窺探或從旁邊調查社會生活底樣相的，他，主要的要自己投人於整個社會生活之中，自身參加于一切社會大衆的戰鬥，而從中去發掘生活的裏層，把握生活的眞實。因此一件偉大文藝作品是必須作家深沉在生活的淵藪中才能創造出來的，如果一個作家失去了生活的滋養，卽是說：如果他囿隨於狹隘的生活範圍之內，不能討論生活，不肯參與生活。以致落在生活後面的時候，那麽要想使得他自己的作品能够反映出廣大的現實圖景，寫出衆多的人物形相，都是不可能的，縱使他有着怎樣優美的文學技巧，有着怎樣可驚的天才想像，充其量也只能够創造出一些徒有形式的美麗而實際沒有內容的作品面已。</p>
<p>在今日我們的國內，正有着許多那樣的作家，他們本身是落在生活的後面的，實際的客觀現實生活，是與他們發生着十分遙遠的距離，他們底創作的題材，為了其自身的生活之貧弱而變得非常地貧弱，他們的筆觸不能不限制於一定的領域之中，他們的視野也不能不停留在一定的幅圓之上，他們的寫作活動，不能不經常地求助於其身邊的瑣事與細節，這些人，單單從自身過去的生活與今日個人的生活中汲取寫作的水分，在目前我們國家的這一個民族革命現實大海的面前，的確是不能不陷於創作貧乏的窘境，在這種生活的窘境中提取出來的東西，不祗不能跟整憫民族革命運動的發展相一致，而且甚至大大的當反這一運動的進流、成為多餘的累贅，這無可諱言，是我們今日的文學運動的缺陷，它需要我們一切的作家去深省，去認識和去矯正。</p>
<p>我們今日的祖國之內，一切的社會的生活。無疑已經起了無可計量的變化，橫溢在全國廣大土地上的抗戰的烽火，使千百萬人成為英勇的鬥士，使無數喊鎭鄉村成為革命的戰場，而敵人在我國土地上的縱橫與凌暴，是巳使得無數的父子兄弟夫婦朋友相離失，使千萬的和平民衆離開了自己的七地而流亡，引起了無數的饑饉，引起了無數的死亡，這種巨大的生活上的變動，對于我們的文學正是一種最豐富的實藏，作家可以從這裏把握到最動人的題材，可以從這裏寫出最優良的作品。但是，正如蘇聯吉爾波丁所說的一樣，「生活變化了，要說出生活的眞實，藝術家必需勿落在生活的後面。應該在肉和具體性之中，看出生活的步伐，知道那新形成的典型的狀勢，知道那新的典型的人們，然後，我們才有可能正確的描盡出今日我們祖國內正處於激變之中的生活諸相，反映出全部我國生活的圖景。</p>
<p>為着要創造偉大的感動的藝術，在一種生活的激變的前頭，藝術家們是萬萬不能落在生活的後面，他必須向生活採取一種深深的關切的以及熱情的態度，投身於激變若的抗戰生活之中，只有這樣，才能够使自己的藝術實踐跟客觀的抗戰生活合拍，才能强化自己的藝術作品底感人的力量，使自己的文學的戰鬥機能，獲得無限的加深和擴大，我們必需知道，居于生活的激變之外，以沒有情熱的熊度去對待自己底描寫的對象，這是最先使藝術家失敗的！</p>
<p>生活變化了，讓我們深沉到這變化的核心去，投身到這變化的激流去，所謂「駛在生活的後面」，讓它變成陳辭吧！</p>

<h3>『中旅』粵語部隊第一砲　『五羊城』今晚獻演</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>在皇后戲院·為嶺大學生會籌款賑難</p>
<p>『好是好的，可是聽不究竟講些什麽！」——這是香港很多粵籍僑胞看了國語話劇之後衆口同聲的嘆詞，雖然比從前的『話劇不値錢」的現象是進步得多了，可是，未能深入廣大的羣衆還是美中不足的憾事。</p>
<p>重建後的「中旅」，積極苦鬥，亟想繼往開來，轟轟烈烈來幹一場，因此除將原有陣容再求充實之外，又成立了，一個粵語部隊，與國語部隊等量齊觀，這樣的恣態，倒亦饒有意趣。</p>
<p>本來，話劇以地方方言演出是不無遜色的；可是、在話劇啓蒙運勳當中、在爭取觀衆作為救亡宣傳的對象的現階段。以粵語深人廣大的羣衆，作為提高觀衆水準的工具，這，未始不是此時此地所應採取的過渡辦法。</p>
<p>日前，「中旅」在利舞台參加公演「黎明之前」時，「贖罪」一劇以國語，粵語同時並用，頗引起觀衆的興趣，今晚在皇后戲院公演「五羊城」完全用粵語演出，却是中旅粵語部隊的第一砲。</p>
<p>這第一砲是經過他們苦心的排練才放出來的，為嶺南大學學生會籌欵助賑而義演，踴躍為公的服務精神亦是値得我們的讚揚。</p>
<p>「五羊城」的劇本是從夏衍，洪深，章泯等所集體創作的「我們的故鄉」稍為更易地點而來的一個國防劇本，內容緊張，生動，針對着此時此地的需要，它吿訴我們：回省城去做順民不是有血性的國民幹的；除非他是有能力有决心囘去負起偉大的任務。</p>
<p>日前，中旅在總排演的時候，記者得有機會先覩為快。他們全體團員那種認眞工作的精神，顯示中旅前途的光明。尤其使人感奮的是拚手胝足，有如工人一樣在製作道具佈景的團員；　者多勞除設計舞台裝置之外，還落力導演之張雪峯氏；唐槐秋國長扮工廠管賬居然亦說了很漂亮的廣州話來，這個不可多得的角色，今晚必定搏得觀衆的好采，</p>
<p>關於「五羊城」劇情的發展，大槪是這樣的：</p>
<p>王祖章是廣州的富戶，在廣州失陷之後，全家就逃難到香港來，但是他和他的長子錦文與長媳李葆珍都過不慣香港的生活，老是　　香港這地方的沒有意思，總想囘到已失陷了的故鄉去，不過，錦文恐怕他的弟弟仲文囘去會闖出亂子的，所以他叫祖章和仲文約定了三個條件，第一不能到學校去念書，第二，不許留在廣州要到鄉下去，第三，不許和『不三不四』的人來往，仲文是一個愛國的熱血靑年，他本來就想囘鄉去做一點救國的工作，因此條件雖然這樣苛刻，他也答應了。</p>
<p>王祖章他們囘到淪陷了的家裏，但是那兒的情形却使他們失望得很，那兒已完全成為×人漢奸們的世界，×人佔住了他們的一家工廠，叫一個叫做殷家明的漢奸去强迫他們以賤價把工廠出賣，×人又强佔了他們的祖坟築為飛機場，使王祖章不得把死在香港的太太運到省城安葬，王祖章因此急氣得病了，王錦文每日也只得在家裏以酒消愁，只有仲文認識得淸楚，他知道當順民不是有血性的人幹的，因此毅然决然加入了游擊隊，並且聯絡好了許多偽軍警察預備待機起事，光復省城，</p>
<p>殷家明累次逼迫王錦文，要他背着王祖辛把工廠偷偷地賣掉；但是錦文因循着總沒有敢答應他。最後一天股家明又來催逼錦文了，恰好同時遇見了囘家來爲這天游擊隊攻城的內應的王仲文，殷家明早就想把仲文抓住前去邀功的，於是就突然拿出手槍來，解除了仲文的武裝預備把他押出去。幸而和仲文同來的還有另外一個游擊隊，他又以奇突的手段制服了殷家明，並把他綁起來。這時一個假裝偽暗探的是游擊隊員劉潛生來了，他帮着仲文解决掉了股家明。同時帮助着仲文就舉起事來。</p>
<p>在他們將要發難的時候。　兵巳先有戒備、他們據險抵抗、王祖章想到×人給他的仇悵、抓起槍來衝出去、受了重傷死了、王錦文也同時壯烈犧牲、仲文和葆珍却終於打出去、看到了游擊隊收復了他們的故鄉、</p>
<p>——這故事、正是粵籍僑胞所夢想追求的；亦是不久將來廣州的新命運演員都很精練、陣容是這樣的：</p>
<p>劇中人　卽演者</p>
<p>王錦文……李亨</p>
<p>李葆珍……鄧竹筠</p>

<h3>衛生當局籲請居民　參加根絕肺癆運動　去年間死於肺癆者約五千人　無論何人均有受傳染之可能</h3>
<p>肺癆症爲慢性之傳染症，處此十里洋場中，人　稠密空氣不新、尤易受有傳染，故死亡率以是日形遞加，衛生常局爲市民健康計，爲此不斷勸喻居民、慎飲食、預加防範、以保大衆健康、茲又發出「肺癆」一文、籲請居民合作云</p>
<p>癆肺</p>
<p>一九三八年間、在香港因患肺癆或肺結核而死者幾達五千人、</p>
<p>其爲禍也、無侖男女、無論老幼、亦均同樣受害、</p>
<p>斯病侵染於人、無分階段、凡人無分種族與階級、均能爲斯病听侵染、然死者大多數皆屬華人失業或入息低徵之輩、</p>
<p>患者盈千累萬、此例伸計、死者每一名、患者總有五六名或八名、甚至十名、雖仍然生存、但亦備嘗斯病之痛苦矣、</p>
<p>肺癆一病、實緣微菌或毒素侵人人體所致、微菌或毒素、間或播散於空氣之中、或食物之內、凡人呼吸、飲食、均能傳入體內、此外尚有其他途徑、能致惹生是病、但因而惹及者、則比較略少、</p>
<p>在香港、此症之病歷普通如下、貧民住小房一間、或牀位一張、光線與空氣、兩皆難於透達、日常所食、又缺之滋養料、因患肺癆者之不慎、隨地唾　痰涎、致使微菌或毒素於痰涎乾後、隨風飄盪、由某里吸入肺裏、於是肺之一葉開始受其侵蝕，繼而延至肺之別一葉、直至左右肺葉緩緩盡受摧殘爲止、間亦有侵及體內其他部份者、</p>
<p>其人旣受傳染、則咳嗽時微菌或毒素隨痰涎而出、痰涎乾後、隨風飄盪、他人吸人、則又惹及其病矣、</p>
<p>無論何人皆有被染之虞、肺癆菌或毒素、其爲害於人、無比此之分、小工人所吐之痰涎、可以惹及司理人、富原者、所吐之痰涎、亦可惹及貧民也、</p>
<p>其他涂徑能致惹生肺癆者、肺癆菌或毒素之傳染於人、尚有其他途徑例如匙　杯碟、遺有病者之涎沬、他人共同用之、或與病者同食、均易染及其病、然在香港、則由呼吸而傳染者較爲普遍、</p>
<p>肺癆傳染、旣然如是、吾人當如何時設法、以免自身及各人不受其侵及平？</p>
<p>一、設法儘量享用日光及新鮮空氣、苟能如是、則肺癆菌或毒素其害雖不盡除、亦當大爲減輕、故吾人居住之處、窗牖與通風、日夜均宜啟開、透入新鮮空氣</p>
<p>二、日常所食、宜擇有益衛生、富有滋養料之簡單食物、包括肉類、鮮魚、鷄蛋、靑菜、生油、及鮮菓等、至若食米、則以紅者爲宜、最低限度、亦用紅米一份、和白米三份也、</p>
<p>三、德意極力保持身體及住處之淸潔、洋視與淸水、其功效有如日光與新鮮空氣、能克制肺癆菌或毒素、然掃抹地方時、切宜留意、毋使塵埃飛起、因塵埃裏或有痰涎乾後，遺下肺癆菌或毒素、是故宜用清水或消毒藥水、先將地方洒濕、然後掃抹或用破布　淸水或火水抹之、</p>
<p>四、凡屬公共地方、例如屋內地板上、街外行人路、電車、公共汽車、火車、及船上等處、慎勿唾吐痰涎、且當以亂吐痰涎之弊、　吿共同遵守、設使必須吐癆、亦宜吐於則內、或吐於有蓋兼有消毒藥水之痰盂內、</p>
<p>五、設不幸染有肺癆、則常從速求治於西法醫生、其病苟未根深蒂固、卽由醫生醫理、當可免其加劇、若調理得宜、則仍有痊愈之可能、至於應否前往醫院抑或留在家內調理、則醫生定能爲病者吿、若留在家內、則爲防免惹及家人及鄰人等起見、宜設法獨居一室、飲食所需碗筷杯碟等、亦宜另行分開、專爲自已之用、口水痰涎尤須切勿隨處亂吐、若要吐痰、可吐在紙上、用火焚化、或吐於痰盂內、所用癆盂、以有蓋者爲宜、中貯消毒藥水、每日至少淸除一次、傾於水廁或便桶內、</p>
<p>六、肺癆菌或毒素、如何侵入人體、如何由一人傳及別人、及如何可以防免、凡有此項智識者、均應盡其天職、爲不知吿、尤須以身作則、庶可收事半工倍之效、</p>
<p>茲懇各界人士、參加社絕肺癆運動助醫務及衛生當局、努力剗除此症、是所厚望焉、</p>

<h3>新舊體操比較觀</h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>二、「伸一與「打一或「踢」的不同：舊體操中「仲」的動作、新體操就呌「打」或「踢」、「伸」的動作、是沒有時間性的、快點、慢點、用力、不用力、都是伸、而「打」或「踢」、倘動作不快、一定失了「打」或「踢」的時效，倘不用力、一定不能完成「打」或「踢」的使命、從這裏我們可以明瞭；這種動作不同的地方、就是「打」或「踢」的動作、比較「伸」的動作、來得快而用力、</p>
<p>三、「屈」與「拉」的不同、「屈」和「拉」這兩種作動、在字面上我們就可以看出它的不同、與上面「伸」「打」『踢』不同的地方、是完全相同的。因爲旣眸作「拉」、不是用力猛拉、拉是不會成立的、</p>
<p>四、增加「振」的動作、這種動作、在新體操裏是最主要的一種、而舊體操裏所沒有的、不論任何部分、都可用這種動作來操練、就是不能直接用振的動作的部分、也可以振動共他部分而間接使它完成使命、譬如胸部不能有直接振的動作、可用兩臂振的動作間接使它得到振的功效、這種動作的功能、可使一個動作、在同一時間內增加動的次數、可使動作逐漸增加深它的運動最、譬如上體向前下振、在一次呼唱的時間、上體就可以俯仰一次、而上體向下彎的度數、也可以利用下振之勢、漸彎漸低、</p>
<p>五、多行「繞」的動作、「繞」的動作、在舊體操裏、雖然有時也有、但行得很少、且爲上肢的腕部、下肢的踝部居多、而新體二不論任何部分都有繞的動作、目的就在於增加運動量、</p>
<p>乙、操法方面、操法的不同、可分左列數點、</p>
<p>一、部位固定之不同、體攤用部位、舊體操裏面也有的、不過不是每節都有、成者時時用同樣部位的、新體操就必先有部位、然後做動作、它除了下肢運動而外、做上肢軀幹等運動時、下肢的部位、往往都是同半開立式、爲的取共站立的基礎、容易穩固、各種動作在穩固的基　下進行、一定比較順利、與舊體操所謂不能常用一種部位、或出足不能常常類同的說法、完全相反、</p>
<p>二、動作連續之不同、新體操的動作、不論四肢或軀幹、都是連續不輟的、絕沒有像舊體　那樣一個動作支持了好久、然後再做第二個動作的、所以它的動作與動作之間、多按　律、它可以在音樂的演奏下從事操練、增加學習者的興趣、</p>
<p>三、方向變換之不同、舊體操在左方操過一種動作必定立刻向右方操練同樣的動作、或左足向前做一種動作之後、一定立刻換右足向前行同樣動作、新體操中凡複雜和變換方向不便的動作、往往在一個方向行了相當次數以後、再換一個方向行同樣次數的動作、這種操法、一則在一佃方向翻複行同樣動作、較易熟習、一則可以免去時時變換方向的麻煩、而所得的效果、與時時變換的實無分軒輊、</p>
<p>四、動作整齊之不同、舊體操的動作、必求整齊劃一、譬如上體前彎、要求彎到九十度的、全體操演者必須要一律彎到九十度、或高或低、都是不許的、新體操就不然、它做任何動作、必須按各人的能力、盡量做去、譬如上體前彎、有的彎到九十度就不能再彎、有的可以灣到一百幾十度、它的要求、就是各盡自己的力量、能彎九十度的、就彎九十度、能彎一百幾十度的、就彎一百幾十度、沒有一定的限制、不求無謂的整齊、</p>
<p>丙、運動量方面、新舊體操、因爲動作和操法不同、才有運動量的不同、</p>
<p>一、因動作不同而運動量不同我們看了上面新舊體　的動作、它有比較的、如「擺」和「舉」、「拉」和「屈」、「打」「踢一和「伸」等、一經比較、運動量孰大孰小、就顯而易見了、「振」和「繞」的動作、雖沒有比較、但振的動作、能在同一時間內增加動作的次數、能使動作逐漸加深度數它具有較大的　動量、也可　不言而喻、一種運動、它動作部分的徑愈長、或動作徑暹之弧愈大的、運動景亦愈大、「繞」的動作、是循着三百六十度的最大圓弧動作的、它運動量的大小、更不必細說了、</p>
<p>二、因操法不同而運動量不同、運動量的大小、與動作當然有直接關係、與操法也有間接關係、前面說過、新體操的操法、是連續不輟的、在同一時間內能增多動作次數的、譬如做兩臂上屈體左右彎的動作、舊體操一定是（一）兩臂上屈、（二）上體左彎、（三）復（一）之姿勢、（四）還原立正、（五六七八）向右行之、八個呼唱中、體彎上的次數、只實際有向左向右各一次、而新體操就是由兩臂上屈、兩足半開立的部位、行上體向左右彎、或上體向左右下振的動作、倘是彎的話、一定是左面一次、右面一次的連續彎、倘是振的話、一定是向左振二到四次、再向右振二到四次、八個呼唱、上體就左右彎了八次、比舊體操多了四倍、況且它每一個動作、沒有一定的限度、必須盡各人力量去做、照這樣看來、兩者運動量有大小之別、不言可知了、</p>
<p>丁、使用肌肉方面、使用肌肉方面、新舊體操有下面兩不同點、一、緊漲弛緩調節之不同、舊體操中、做任何動作、往往自始至終肌　都是緊漲收縮、不到一節體操做完、或休息的時候、不結肌肉以弛緩放鬆的機會、而新體操期一個動作中、有緊漲、必有弛緩以事調節、譬如兩臂左右平擺、在向左右擺出時、肌肉是收縮緊漲的、用力的、到擺囘至身前交又時、就是弛緩放鬆、不用力了、這樣肌肉的緊漲弛緩有了調節、就不致變爲疆硬呆板的死肌肉、</p>
<p>二、主動助動有別之不同、舊體操的動作、也有主動助動之分、但它使用肌肉、就不論是主動和助動的部分、一體收縮緊漲、新體操則主動部分的肌肉、必盡量牧縮、助動部分的肌肉、必盡量放鬆、譬如舊體操的展臂挺胸、展臂是助動、挺陶是主動、但它展臂時、臂部的肌肉、必定同時收縮、而新體操就用臂後振挺胸、它振臂的動作、目的在帮胸部的挺出、完全放鬆着自由動作、收縮的只有胸部的肌肉、這樣肌肉的收縮、專一注目主動的部分、主動部分肌的收縮才能能達極度、</p>
<p>戊、價植方面、我國自從球術運動盛行後、體操早失去了體育上的地位、人們詆燬它的理由、不外是說他的動作呆板、不能使習者發生興趣、不能養成靈活的肌肉、應付卒變的環境、它運動量微小、不能適應生理的要求不能達成健身的目的、這種理由衡之過去的體操方法、不爲無因、但新體操怎樣、動作呆板嗎？它動作連續而有韻律、肌肉緊漲弛緩有調節、不能謂之呆板、它運動量輕微嗎、它擺、拉、打、踢、振、緝、等新動作、和各種創見的新採法、使它的運動量比較舊體操、豈祇增加倍徙、它實在是活潑的、有興味的、運動量宏大的、適合人們生理要求的體察、它足以打破人們一切評毀、她可以取球類運動而代之、希望國人加以提倡吧、</p>

<h3>The Japanese Aggressors' New Offensive</h3>
<p>Following the Tianjin incident, which evolved from a local issue into a general one, and the increasingly intense anti-British movement across occupied territories, the Japanese, again, launched a large-scale landing at Shantou yesterday at dawn. Simultaneously, the Japanese navy dispatched troops to invade Dayu Island, a small island near Langyu Island, engaging in mutual fire with the Chinese garrison on the opposite shore. This indeed demonstrates a new military offensive recently undertaken by the Japanese aggressors.</p>
<p>Having realized that military aggression alone cannot achieve the goal of conquering China due to the prolonged military stalemate, some of the more experienced individuals are eager to end the Sino-Japanese war. Consequently, two factions have emerged within Japan. The elder statesmen faction hopes to conclude the war in the autumn, aiming to utilize political and economic tactics in addition to military means. The younger officers faction, helpless in the face of military stagnation, on one hand, allows the elder statesmen faction to use Wang Jingwei; on the other hand, it launches incidents from other angles to threaten third countries. As a result, these actions may serve to hasten the end of the war. There might be a temporary alignment in Japan's pragmatic diplomacy from now on, but the contradictions will grow increasingly due to the impossibility of this illusion.</p>
<p>In the Tianjin incident, what the Japanese side demanded was that Britain fundamentally change its Far East policy, helping Japan establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia," effectively abandoning its support for China and instead oppressing China, so that Japan can force us into a "treaty of surrender" in the near future. The intensification of anti-British sentiment in various occupied areas is further fueling this threat. The Japanese army's landing in Shantou has an even more complex purpose, but it is still nothing more than a further step in this new offensive. First, it aims to more strictly blockade an important Chinese seaport, making communication between the mainland and overseas more difficult and increasing panic among the people who are resisting the war. Second, it further disrupts a residential area for British expatriates, giving the British people one more reason to desire peace. Third, it extends the disturbance to third countries such as the United States and France, creating another obstacle, or even a complete cut-off, in the routes between these countries and China. The Japanese army might even carry out further disturbances, bombings, and occupations at other coastal strongholds, such as in various parts of Fujian, to intensify the new posture of military aggression.</p>
<p>However, the new Japanese military offensive has a smaller impact on China and a greater impact on Britain, the United States, and France. Our supreme military authorities anticipated a strict blockade of the entire coast long before the war began. We are prepared to retreat into the interior to wage a protracted war with the Japanese. The Japanese cannot force us to surrender simply by blockading the coast, and they themselves understand this. The main reason remains to disturb the vision and hearing of third countries, to trouble the people of third countries, and especially to further surround Hong Kong, so that third country governments, especially Britain, feel the need to step forward to mediate. However, Japan is still testing, seeing what Britain's attitude is and what conditions it might offer to mediate. Regarding this kind of testing, what is important is that the attitude of Britain, France, and the United States in supporting China can continue to be maintained. On one hand, ignore Japan's instigation and temptation; on the other hand, actively prepare for military confrontation, such as the military cooperation between Britain and France in the Far East, which is very important. This cooperation should be expanded to invite the United States, Siam, and the Netherlands, and other related countries to participate. If Britain can deal with it firmly, the Japanese paper tiger will not be difficult to expose further.</p>
<h3>Political Education Work of a Model Division</h3>
<p>— Xiang Rong</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) In the 23 months of the War of Resistance, although we have accumulated a lot of experience that can be described regarding political work in the army, I would like to briefly describe the political education work carried out by the ××× Division, which has the reputation of being a model division, to explain the educational policy it adopted, the core content of the education, the principles of implementation, and the system of political education, etc., which may provide some reference for various resistance units.</p>
<p>I. The General Policy of Political Education</p>
<p>What is the policy of political education in the army? This is very clear. The common goal of the entire nation's struggle is to resist the war, strive for the final victory of the resistance, and complete the nation-building under the Three Principles of the People. The policy of political education in the army is, of course, also for the sake of resistance, to improve the combat effectiveness of the troops, to strive for greater victories in combat, and to achieve the goal of "inevitable victory in resistance and inevitable success in nation-building."</p>
<p>"This war of resistance cannot be completed in a year or two. It must go through extreme hardship and difficulty before the final victory can be obtained (Chiang Kai-shek, Public Announcement in 1937). Therefore, the most basic issue facing the national army resisting the war is how to improve the national consciousness, national unity, and national confidence of every soldier, to encourage their courage and determination to kill the enemy; to cultivate their spirit of sacrifice and the consciousness of hard struggle; to strengthen their spirit of not being arrogant in victory, not being discouraged in failure, and being indomitable in the face of all dangers; to firmly establish their belief that "inevitable victory in resistance and inevitable success in nation-building"; and to allow them to shed the last drop of blood for the cause of national independence, freedom, and liberation under the Supreme Commander's policy of adhering to a protracted war of resistance.</p>
<p>Political education in the army is to arm the minds of every anti-Japanese warrior with the basic policy mentioned above so that every warrior can become a conscious national hero.</p>
<p>II. The Central Content of Political Education</p>
<p>According to the current general policy of political education, and also taking into account the need to cultivate soldiers into cadres and lower-level cadres into middle and upper-level cadres, we are conducting the central content of political education in the army according to the following points:</p>
<p>First, our entire Chinese nation is now unanimously engaged in a sacred war of national self-defense. Therefore, we must conduct education on national liberation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the demon king ×××× Hitler is also vigorously advocating the nationalism of the Greater Germanic nation, but our nationalism is different from Hitler's nationalism. "There is the patriotism of the Japanese invaders and Hitler, and there is our patriotism." Fascism is national aggression; our nationalism seeks the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>What content should be included in the education on national liberation?</p>
<p>1.  National consciousness: We start by explaining what kind of country China is, what kind of country Japan is, the reasons and processes for Japan's historical aggression against China, and the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan's attempt to destroy our country with a large-scale invasion of China, in order to improve the national consciousness and national hatred of every soldier (of course, only hate the Japanese fascist warlords, not the Japanese working masses), to strengthen every soldier's courage to kill the enemy and determination to fight.</p>
<p>2.  National unity: Based on Chiang Kai-shek's message to the nation, "External enemies are not to be feared; only internal unity is needed," we explain the principle that the entire nation, regardless of class, party, old feuds, or personal grievances, should unite to resist Japan, the relationship between the military and the people, the relationship between friendly forces, and the relationship between the Chinese people and the Japanese working masses; we explain the relationship between the Three Principles of the People and various ideologies, the basic national policy of the Outline for Resistance and Nation-Building; and at the same time, we explain that we must strictly guard against the Japanese and their running dogs, traitors, and other factions' conspiracies to split and undermine the unity of our entire nation.</p>
<p>3.  National confidence: From the comparison of national strength between China and Japan and the nature of the Sino-Japanese War, we explain that the final victory of the resistance must belong to us; we explain the protracted nature of the Sino-Japanese War and the three stages of the protracted war; we explain the strategic policy that our country should adopt; we explain that we will have great difficulties in the long war process, that we must go through a very painful period, that we must endure this difficulty, overcome this difficulty, and only then can we strive for the final victory; and we explain that "once the war has started, there is only the principle of risking the lives of the entire nation and sacrificing to the end, and there is no reason to stop or compromise halfway" (Chiang Kai-shek's Lushan Talk), resolutely opposing all attempts and actions of surrender and compromise.</p>
<p>Second, we are an army, an army that shoulders the important responsibility of resisting Japan and saving the country today. Therefore, we must conduct education related to army life.</p>
<p>What are the issues related to army life?</p>
<p>1.  Why join the army, and why fight? Based on the principles of "every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country," "being a soldier is the sacred duty of every citizen," "joining the anti-Japanese army, fighting Japan to save China, is our most glorious cause," and "we cannot survive without fighting Japan," we explain why we join the army. We also explain, based on what Chiang Kai-shek said in his message to the nation: "This war of resistance is a necessary process in the National Revolution and is a war for the independence and survival of the invaded nation against the invaders," that our war of resistance is for survival, that only resistance can avoid the tragedy of national subjugation, and that we expose the traitorous theory that "resistance will surely lead to national destruction" and "another war will surely lead to national destruction."</p>
<p>2.  Why should we abide by discipline and obey orders? We explain that striving for victory in war depends on consistency between superiors and subordinates, consistency of the whole, coordinated action, and that abiding by discipline and obeying orders is obeying the command of unified action. At the same time, we explain that discipline is for the benefit of resistance and for the benefit of the entire nation, so we must consciously abide by discipline.</p>
<p>3.  Why should we be brave in combat and endure hardship? Being brave in killing the enemy on the battlefield and enduring hardship in life are qualities that every anti-Japanese soldier should possess. Without these qualities, we cannot fight a cruel war with the fierce enemy, let alone eliminate the enemy and defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>4.  Why should we diligently study military affairs, politics, and culture? Improving military technology is to strive for greater victories with the least sacrifice; improving political standards is to arm our minds and strengthen our belief in struggle; improving cultural standards is to open our eyes to see the world, and at the same time, improving cultural standards also helps the study of military affairs and politics. All of this should also point to a goal, which is to cultivate oneself into a cadre or a more responsible cadre.</p>
<p>5.  Why should we unite and love each other? The thousands of people in the army, although some come from the South and some come from the North, some have a long history of struggle, and some have recently joined the army, each has a different face; but for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country, everyone has one heart. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the unity and love between comrades, not to beat or scold each other, not to quarrel, to share weal and woe, to support each other in times of illness, and to advise each other in times of mistakes.</p>
<p>6.  Why should we become one with the residents? The army is the armed force of the people and serves the people. At the same time, to defeat the enemy, it is necessary for the military and the people to unite closely and mobilize the people to fight together. Therefore, the army must be close to the people, help the people, and not disturb or harm the people.</p>
<p>7.  Why should we win over the enemy army and treat the enemy prisoners of war kindly? Because the soldiers of the Japanese army, as well as most of the officers and soldiers in the puppet army, were forced to invade China; their interests are necessarily opposed to those of the Japanese warlords. Therefore, we must win over the lower-ranking officers and soldiers in the puppet army, make them realize their position of overthrowing the Japanese warlords, and cooperate with the Chinese people hand in hand. In addition to general political propaganda, treating puppet prisoners of war kindly is a good way to win over the puppet army.</p>
<p>Third, our resistance is not only to drive the Japanese out of China but also for the bright future of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we must provide theoretical education on the Three Principles of the People and education on advanced scientific thought.</p>
<p>What are some specific contents? In addition to what has already been said above, we also have education on the Three Principles of the People, education on the history of China's modern revolutionary movement, and education on common sense of social science, education on political economy and new philosophy, and so on.</p>
<p>Fourth, because the cultural level in the army is relatively low, and because cultural knowledge is closely related to military and political education, we need to conduct cultural education.</p>
<p>In the past, there have been incomplete understandings that cultural education is only literacy education, and there have also been improper views that cultural education is linked to entertainment work, called cultural and entertainment work, so cultural education is also regarded as something similar to entertainment work, and the importance of cultural education is underestimated, treating it as a kind of auxiliary education. We have given these views corrections.</p>
<p>What content does cultural education include? We believe that literacy education naturally occupies a major position in cultural education, but it cannot include all of cultural education. In addition, there is education on natural science, education on geography and history, education on arithmetic, and so on.</p>
<p>Fifth, the above basic education cannot include some temporary current affairs issues. Therefore, we need education on current affairs.</p>
<p>What are some temporary current affairs issues? Such as:</p>
<p>1.  Political mobilization for major battles;</p>
<p>2.  Analysis of the war situation in various parts of the country;</p>
<p>3.  The significance of commemorative days;</p>
<p>4.  And the correction of certain bad tendencies that occur temporarily in the army, etc.</p>
<p>The explanation and education of these issues are promoted based on the general education policy. However, it is not included, nor can it be included, in the teaching materials of basic education, so it is listed within the education of current affairs issues.</p>
<p>III. Requirements for Implementing Political Education</p>
<p>With a general policy of political education and a core content of political education, the next question is the requirements for implementing political education, which is also the question of the principles for implementing political education. Our principles are the following four.</p>
<p>First, Less but Finer</p>
<p>What is meant by less? Does it mean that we only simply require understanding one or a few basic questions? No. We require that the questions we need to understand are quite numerous, including military, political, cultural, and basic theories. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Battle of Shantou Unfolds. Enemy Ships Break Through Blockade and Land by Force. Street Fighting Ensues Yesterday Afternoon, Our Forces Counterattack.</h3>
<p>[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Shantou, 21st, 10:30 AM] Ten enemy planes raided Shantou City suddenly at 5:00 AM on the 21st. At 5:30 AM, more than 30 enemy warships and dozens of speedboats gathered outside Mayu port and invaded Shantou City. A cannon battle immediately broke out with our coastal defense forces. Under the cover of artillery fire, enemy speedboats broke through the blockade line at 10:09 AM. Simultaneously, hundreds of enemy soldiers forcibly landed on the east coast of Dahao Island, west of Mayu port. Our defending forces bravely resisted and are still in fierce battle.</p>
<p>[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Chao'an, 21st, 12:00 PM] After breaking through the Mayu port blockade line at around 10:00 AM on the 21st, enemy warships and speedboats continued to invade Shantou City. Our defending forces calmly responded, waiting for the enemy speedboats to approach before launching a sudden barrage, sinking more than ten enemy speedboats. Under the cover of warship artillery fire and aircraft, the enemy still forcibly landed, and street fighting ensued at 12:00 PM. As of the time of this dispatch, our forces are still engaged in fierce battle.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese military personnel here believe that the occupation of Shantou is quite important because, since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has replaced Hong Kong as the port for China to import military supplies and export local products. Shantou's foreign trade is quite prosperous, second only to Shanghai and Tianjin. Recently, all military supplies transported to the Chinese mainland have been transshipped from Hong Kong to Shantou and Hanoi.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shantou, 21st] There are currently seven Japanese destroyers in Shantou port. Mayu was occupied at 7:00 AM this morning. Multiple Japanese planes bombed the city and strafed with machine guns. Shantou is still in the hands of Chinese forces. All foreigners are safe.</p>
<p>[External News from This Port] The Japanese army launched a large-scale landing in Shantou at dawn this morning. The landing was confirmed by the Japanese military. The military claimed that it was jointly conducted by naval and land forces, and fierce fighting is currently underway. Although the "Danat" is the only British warship stationed in Shantou, the British side has not yet decided whether it is necessary to send an additional warship to Shantou. According to the latest news, the Japanese army landed in two locations a few miles outside Shantou and is advancing inland. According to Japanese sources at 11:00 AM this morning, they admit to encountering strong resistance from the Chinese side, with heavy casualties on both sides. In addition to the British warship "Danat" near Shantou, there is also an American destroyer. Most of the foreigners in Shantou are British, with about 40 to 50 Americans.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] According to a naval communiqué issued by the Imperial Headquarters, multiple Japanese warships sailed within two miles of Shantou at 1:50 AM this morning and are now clearing the sea of obstacles and advancing forward. According to Hong Kong telegraphs, about 300 to 500 Japanese troops first attempted to land near Shantou. Despite strong resistance from the Chinese army, they were ultimately successful. The vanguard forces are advancing inland, apparently with the aim of encircling Shantou and cutting off the Chaoshan Railway (Chaozhou is 27 miles from Shantou). The communiqué also stated that transport ships also participated in assisting the navy in landing. A spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy stated that the Japanese navy's landing in Shantou is sufficient to strengthen the blockade of the Chinese coast, from which General Chiang Kai-shek is still obtaining foreign military supplies. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Japan's policy of respecting the rights and interests of third countries remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Landing Process</p>
<p>[Express News from This Port, Shantou] The day before yesterday at noon, seven Japanese planes flew to Chaoshan to bomb, but the local people had already been evacuated, so the losses were light. The general public had long known that this was a precursor to a Japanese invasion. That evening, more than sixty Japanese cruisers, destroyers, and speedboats patrolled the sea off Nan'ao, and the situation was tense. Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, Mayor Luo Xianxiang, Administrative Commissioner He Chunfan, Brigade Commander Wu Luxin, County Magistrates Chen Youyun, Bian Zhishan, Cai Fenchu, and others held a meeting and immediately issued an emergency martial law order and decided on strategies for defending the territory. Yesterday at dawn, when the sky was still dim and rain threatened to fall, Japanese fleet commander Shiozawa directed more than a thousand naval marines to board more than twenty speedboats and attack the North and South ports (22 li from Shantou City) in Cheng District. When they approached the coast, they were discovered by our defending forces, and a fierce battle broke out. We were in an advantageous position, so we threatened the enemy, causing more than a hundred casualties and then retreating in defeat. Before six o'clock, Japanese warships had fiercely bombarded our North and South ports, as well as Beigang outside Mentou Township. For a time, there were continuous loud noises, and the sound shook the heavens and the earth. Soon, 5,000 Japanese troops landed in separate locations. Our army, because the coastal defenses were completely destroyed, then rose up to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Local military and political officials all arrived at the front line to command, so morale was a hundredfold. In this battle, casualties were very heavy on both sides. After a fierce battle, our army retreated to a new position and bravely held on. When the Japanese army landed in the North and South ports, a portion of the Japanese marines landed at Dahao, across from Shantou City, and have now advanced towards ××× Stone. This place is the residential area of British, American, and French people residing in Shantou. As of about 2:00 PM, the Japanese army at the North and South ports could only advance four Chinese miles due to our army's strong resistance, threatening the east side of Shantou City, with the aim of encircling the north side of Shantou and launching a pincer attack with the Japanese at Dahao. The Shantou City police and anti-Japanese self-defense forces have all been ordered to gather in preparation for battle. The Japanese landing in Beigang has not made much progress. It is estimated that they intend to directly approach Chao'an and cut off our main highway line in eastern Guangdong. At 1:00 PM, multiple Japanese speedboats sailed into the Tuo River, so the situation in Shantou City has completely entered a state of war. A small portion of merchants and residents were ordered to evacuate yesterday morning. Shops were closed, and the city was silent. Foreign merchants were also advised by our authorities not to risk entering the city. All preparations for street fighting have been completed. If necessary, a scorched earth policy will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Strict Alert in the British Concession of Tianjin. Volunteer Business Corps Mobilized. Increased Street Posts.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 21st] The British Concession's Public Works Bureau here is currently organizing an emergency corps, entirely composed of British citizens, unarmed, and wearing distinctive military uniforms. These personnel will specialize in handling various important tasks. The chairman of the Public Works Bureau told Reuters that although 700 Chinese police officers received warnings from the Japanese authorities, only one resigned. According to an unofficial Japanese report, vegetable vendors have now decided to boycott the British Concession. The market situation in the blocked area is already very bleak. The British authorities are now doing everything possible to promote commerce.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 20th] The Tianjin British Concession Volunteer Business Corps has been ordered to prepare to be mobilized at any time. Two British warships docked here, the "Sandwich I" arrived yesterday afternoon, while the "Rostov" was scheduled to leave Tianjin today, but this trip has now been cancelled. A British military truck, under the protection of British soldiers, carried a large batch of vegetables to the British Concession yesterday. This is the first move by the British side to break through the blockade restrictions and transport food. The Japanese soldiers guarding the blockade line witnessed the truck passing through without inspection. As for the rumor that seven trucks passed through the blockade line on Sunday, it is inaccurate. The Japanese are still constantly inciting anti-British sentiment. Chinese hotels have been forced to issue notices advising the British Concession to yield, offering half-price rent to those who leave the British Concession to reside in the hotels. The food shortage problem in the concession is still very serious. The Japanese side has completely prohibited milk from being sent into the concession, and coal is also in short supply. Last night, the blockade restrictions were slightly relaxed, perhaps because tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival. However, British people have not shown any optimism.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] The British Concession authorities refused to sell a portion of the three million bags of flour that they intended to transport to the Chinese mainland. Furthermore, "Chinese merchants" outside the concession severed commercial relations with the concession yesterday, implementing a cessation of trade with merchants within the concession. Currently, the volunteer army in the British Concession is fully mobilized, with a total of about 1,000 armed personnel. Armored vehicles guard important streets, and sentries are stationed. According to a spokesman for the Japanese military authorities here yesterday, the Japanese army's blockade of the Tianjin Concession is to directly deal with the British who are "disrupting order in North China and hindering economic development." If Britain implements economic retaliation, Japan will no longer respect British rights and interests in China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] According to external news from Beiping, the anti-British movement in North China has spread even wider as a result of incitement by the Japanese side and the puppet government of North China controlled by the Japanese side. It is said that an anti-British mass sports meeting is scheduled to be held here on the 23rd, and "Japanese reserve soldiers" will also participate. Newspapers have been continuously attacking the British side on a large scale in recent days. Whether they are major or minor, all matters involving the British are under attack.</p>
<h3>The Northern Front Situation Tense: A Major Battle at Zhongtiao Mountain About to Re-Erupt; We Intensify the Struggle for [Area illegible in original]</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 20th] The Jin [region illegible in original] has increased by approximately 10,000 troops, and we are also fully prepared. A major battle at Zhongtiao Mountain is about to erupt again. Our guerrillas have achieved minor victories near Fencheng, Jishan, Wenxi, and Wanquan.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 20th] It is reported that the casualties of the [enemy illegible in original] Fifth, Twenty-first, and 114th Divisions, which have been invading southeastern Shandong, have reached 3,000. Fierce battles continue daily within the borders of Mengyin, Yishui, Juxian, Rizhao, and Feixian, where we hold the advantage. Our troops in Hebei Province have been quite active recently. We have recovered many counties, villages, and towns in southern Hebei, and the overall situation is stable. It is heard that the [enemy illegible in original] is paying special attention to North China, and troops are being transferred northward from South China from time to time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xi'an, 20th] Military news: A certain unit of ours in southern Hebei pursued the [enemy illegible in original] forces retreating towards Renxian, making rapid progress. The main forces of two [enemy illegible in original] regiments, including the Morimoto regiment, have lost more than half of their strength. The remaining approximately 2,000 men are still retreating northward.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 21st] During a press gathering yesterday, a certain military authority spokesperson declared that the Japanese army's position on the Guangdong front is gradually becoming unstable. After reorganization, Chinese guerrillas have been very active, repeatedly repelling landing Japanese troops and annihilating small units. Furthermore, in the Hubei area, the Japanese army's four-division attempted invasion of Changsha was thwarted, as their plans were disrupted due to the continuous interception by Chinese army guerrillas, depleting their strength. In addition, the area east of the Xinchuhai River estuary on the southern bank of the Yellow River has been flooded, forcing the Japanese army to rush to build military roads in an attempt to maintain communication lines, but these efforts are frequently attacked by guerrillas, ultimately leading to the failure of the Japanese plan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 21st] Several hundred [enemy illegible in original] soldiers in the Shanyidian area of northern Henan have been completely eliminated after days of mopping-up operations by our troops. On the 14th, our troops fiercely attacked Neihuang, clashing again and entering the city. The [enemy illegible in original] morale collapsed, and they fled northward in a panic. Neihuang was immediately recovered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Place in Southern Shandong, 21st] Since the beginning of this month, the [enemy illegible in original] in Shandong Province have gathered 20-30,000 [enemy illegible in original] troops to launch a fierce attack on southern Shandong. Our army has adopted mobile warfare tactics, annihilating countless [enemy illegible in original]. Currently, the [enemy illegible in original] offensive has been thwarted, and we are launching a fierce counterattack. Laiyang City in Jiaodong has been retaken by our troops, with over 300 [enemy illegible in original] soldiers killed and over 100 guns captured.</p>
<h3>The National Government Officially Orders the Arrest of Wang [Jingwei]; Overseas Chinese Unanimously Applaud</h3>
<p>Reports from Various Embassies and Consulates</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 21st] Wang Zhaoming has betrayed national policy and colluded with the [enemy illegible in original], engaging in treacherous conspiracies. Compatriots throughout the country are filled with hatred.

<h3>British Merchant Warehouse in Pudong, Shanghai, Repeatedly Catches Strange Fires; Two Incidents of Arson Result in Losses of Over 100,000; Rumors Suggest a Political Background</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 21st] News from Shanghai: A fire broke out in the [Pile character] warehouse of the British merchant [Gonghexing] Wharf in Pudong on the evening of the 17th, destroying and soaking thousands of bales of cotton, with losses amounting to 150-160,000 [unit illegible]. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. However, at around 11:00 AM on the 21st, another strange fire broke out in the [Western character] warehouse. Workers were having lunch when they saw thick smoke coming from the warehouse. They immediately went inside to investigate and found a raging fire. They immediately began to extinguish the fire, which was put out in about half an hour. Over a hundred bales of cotton were destroyed, with losses of approximately 5,000 [unit illegible]. It was previously rumored that someone was secretly active at the wharf, so this strange fire is considered suspicious. The wharf authorities have decided to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<h3>Special Correspondence from Our Newspaper: Luofu Journal (8)</h3>
<p>— [Pseudonym - Liuying]</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning, the sound of artillery erupted from Duling'ao, followed by the sound of machine guns like a string of firecrackers from our side. Battalion Commander Liang personally came to Su Lao Guan and said to us, "The [enemy illegible in original] have fallen into our trap. We have discovered a total of over 2,000 [enemy illegible in original] infantry and artillery troops on the front lines. What about us? To be honest, there is only one company of our men here, but we can resist until twelve o'clock. Please go towards Henghe." We folded our clothes and left Su Lao Guan. The peaceful atmosphere of the Taoist temple was shattered by the sound of artillery, and they also became nervous. Along the way, there were processions of civilians, with three or five people carrying their belongings, followed by a rifle, each concerned with their own escape. This is highly inappropriate. If these armed people were organized, I believe the [enemy illegible in original] would not dare to come here.</p>
<p>We advanced along the mountain road. The sound of artillery drew nearer. Several shells flew over our heads and exploded in the fields not far away. The clattering of machine guns roared at the enemy.</p>
<p>A sudden rainstorm shielded our departure from the front line. At twelve noon, we arrived at Henghe. Looking back at the northern side of Mount Luofu, black smoke billowed up, and the invaders' fire was spreading again. The next day, we received news that over eighty houses in Su Lao Village had been burned. Our troops and civilians suffered no losses.</p>
<p>The One Who Tied the Bell Must Untie It</p>
<p>Having received this lesson from the [enemy illegible in original] and having seen many things in many places, I feel that our strength for resistance has not yet been fully developed, and the coordination between the military and the people is not sufficient to strike the [enemy illegible in original] effectively—painful things are also unavoidable. To avoid "friction" in writing, I can only swallow it down into my stomach. However, one thing that moves and excites me the most is "the greatness of the people's power." From Changning to Futian, from Huzhen back to Boluo City, the highways along the way have been destroyed quite successfully, with some becoming potholes, some turning into paddy fields, and some having dozens or hundreds of people working on them. They do not resent themselves but actively wield their hoes. In addition to carrying hoes, shovels, and other weapons, they also carry rain gear and cooking pots, making temporary kitchens in the shade of trees. Their stoves are dug temporarily in the ground. The rain wets the stove fires for cooking, but they continue to rekindle them and make the dishes hot. Their spirit of perseverance should be admired by everyone.</p>
<p>"You've worked hard, brothers!" Comrade Chen comforted them.</p>
<p>"No, sir, this is what we should do. We will not allow the [enemy illegible in original] to come again, so that the [enemy illegible in original] have no road to walk. Digging up the road is a good thing," a peasant brother replied, stopping his hoe. "Please ask the Allied Forces to block the devils, and we will destroy the highways in the rear, to see how the [enemy illegible in original] will step into our Boluo?"</p>
<p>What a moving voice! They used to build the uneven ground into long, flat highways, helping the country's construction. Now, they have to destroy them, and they will still be responsible for building them in the future. How great is their power!</p>
<h3>The Rapidly Advancing Mining and Metallurgical Industries in the Southwest; The Government Revises Regulations to Encourage Foreign Investment; The Resources Commission Mobilizes All Parties to Vigorously Promote Development</h3>
<p>Among China's mineral resources, in addition to coal and iron, antimony, tin, tungsten, and lead are also important. Unfortunately, the main mining areas for coal and iron are all in occupied territories. Only the production areas for antimony, tin, tungsten, and copper are located in the southwest, hence the name "special metals of the South." Since the start of the war of resistance, people from all walks of life have realized that developing the southwest is an important task for national construction during the war of resistance. Therefore, no effort has been spared in the construction of the mining and metallurgical industries. The following is a brief overview of the current state of development:</p>
<p>Revision of Mining Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>In order to develop the mining industry in the southwest, the government first revised the mining laws and regulations, allowing foreign investment, and formulated regulations for the management of state-owned mining areas, and established mining and metallurgical research institutes. (A) The mining and metallurgical research institute has the following groups: (1) Procurement group: researching mining engineering technology, and investigating mineral products and mines; (2) Mineral processing group: researching mineral processing and coal washing technology; (3) Smelting group: researching the smelting technology of copper, iron, or metal non-metals; development and utilization of fuel; and investigation of smelting plants; (4) Testing group: testing and researching various mineral and metallurgical products and their accessories. Each group has a director in charge. (B) The management methods of state-owned mining areas are divided into the following categories: (1) directly managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (2) entrusted to other central government agencies; (3) lease of state-owned mining areas, which can be jointly operated with the provincial government; however, the capital occupied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs or other central government agencies shall not be less than 50%. If foreigners are allowed to invest according to the Mining Law, the capital occupied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs or other central government agencies shall not be less than 34%; (4) Mining tax payment methods: If there are normal reasons for not starting construction within two years, the tax may be exempted. (C) Allowing foreign investment: The Mining Law stipulates that foreigners are allowed to invest in and jointly form limited liability companies to operate mining, but it shall be approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and subject to the following restrictions: (1) Over half of the total shares of the company shall be owned by Chinese citizens; (2) Over half of the company's directors shall be Chinese citizens; (3) The chairman of the board and general manager of the company shall be Chinese citizens, but the mining rights shall not be transferred to foreigners. If construction does not start within two years after registration, or if construction is suspended for more than one year, the mining rights shall be revoked immediately.</p>
<p>Current Status of Mining and Smelting</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Mining Law, the Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial governments have actively carried out the work. The current status of mining and smelting of various minerals is recorded as follows: (A) Tungsten ore sand can be used for steelmaking and for making steel wires in light bulbs, and it is also a necessary product for military equipment manufacturing. The world's output is very small, but China is uniquely blessed. Since the National Government implemented centralized management and control, the total export volume has gradually increased. The places where tungsten is produced are Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces, especially Jiangxi, which is the most abundant, often accounting for more than 95% of the country's total output and 36% of the world's [illegible] output. At present, tungsten industry management offices have been established in various tungsten producing provinces. The market price is announced by the management office, the export is unified, and smuggling is strictly prohibited. Before the war, each [Dan unit] was about 50 national currency units, and after the war, the tungsten industry abroad rose sharply, and the purchase price rose to 100 yuan. The purchase price of foreign firms in Hong Kong was more than 200 yuan. The export value of tungsten sand was only 6,315,349 yuan in the Republic of China years 21-23, and in the 26th year [of the Republic] it rose to 40,758,592 yuan; in the first eight months of the 27th year, it also reached 38,518,808 yuan. Germany ranked first in the countries to which it was exported, the United States ranked second, and the United Kingdom ranked third. After the war, the National Government gave the right to export tungsten products to the Fu Company. Recently, the Resources Commission decided to adopt the principle of self-mining, self-selling, and self-use, and established technical groups in the management offices of various producing areas to seek rationalization and economization of production, and planned to set up tungsten processing plants. (B) Iron is the main raw material for industry. Although China is rich in iron production, due to the lack of high-temperature smelting furnaces, the production of wrought iron has not been able to supply it universally. Before the fall of Hankou, most of the pig iron needed in various places was supplied by the Liuhegou Pig Iron Company in Hankou. After the abandonment of Wuhan, the source of pig iron was suddenly lacking, so the price of iron soared, from more than 300 yuan per ton to more than 700 yuan. The Adjustment Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established an iron smelting plant in Sichuan, purchasing a high-temperature melting furnace with a melting force of ten [Unit illegible] per day. Before the abandonment of Wuhan, more than 1,000 tons of pig iron were transported out, and at the same time, new [mines illegible] were actively planned for development. According to expert measurements, the iron deposits in Lugu, which belongs to Mianning County, Xikang, amount to 80 million tons. In addition, the iron storage in Tianquan Rongjing can produce 4500 tons per month from January of this year. In the future, Luding will expand production in the whole area, and produce tens of thousands of tons of iron every year. The remaining iron ore reserves in the southwestern provinces are approximately 39,616,000 tons. Therefore, the wrought iron needed by the people in the future can be gradually self-sufficient. (C) In order to support the development of tin, the government plans to set up a complete company by the Resources Commission to engage in mining, washing, and refining, with a total capital of 6 million yuan. At the same time, the Yunnan Provincial Government and the Fudian New Bank jointly established a trade association to handle the export of old tin [smelting product unclear]. In the future, it will be exported directly from Mengzi and will no longer be re-smelted in Hong Kong before being exported. The production areas of tin in China are almost entirely in the southwestern provinces; Yunnan ranks first, with an annual output of about 9,000 tons, accounting for 88% of the country's total output. Guangxi ranks second, with an annual output of about 300 tons; Hunan ranks third, with an annual output of about 90 tons; Guangdong has only 50 tons. The total tin production in the four provinces is about 9,400 tons. Most of this product is [Shi illegible] shipped abroad; in recent years, there has been a rapid surge, and its export value is often more than 30 million yuan in national currency, ranking seventh among the country's foreign exports. As for the nation's [illegible Shi illegible] production of tin, it ranks fifth among the world's tin producing countries. (D) Copper is the most important material in the electrical industry, and its applications are extremely wide. Pure copper can be used to make transmission lines for trams, telephones, and telegraphs, as well as machinery for other industries. The alloy of copper and zinc is called brass, which is used to manufacture screws, round rods, watch parts, and bullet casings. The national copper mining areas are in Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces, with a total area of 47.6 million acres. The Dongchuan copper mine in Yunnan is the area with the most copper production in our country. Now, the Yunnan Provincial Resources Commission and the Yunnan Provincial Government jointly operate the Dianbei [illegible] Affairs Bureau to handle the Nuo mines in the northern part of the province, and all assets in Dongchuan will be used as part of the government investment. The Pengxian copper mine in Sichuan is the second largest copper mine in China, and the Resources Commission has sent Chang Kai to start construction. According to estimates by the [Hua illegible] Geological Survey Institute, the mine reserves are approximately 100,000 tons. (E) Antimony is a rich mineral resource in [illegible] South Province, accounting for 99% of the country. The total output of the province is 17,753 tons, accounting for more than 87% of the world's output. Xinhua tin mine, Yiyang Banxi and other places are the most prosperous for mining, followed by Anhua Shao [illegible], Yuanling Xinwei and other places, followed by Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou and other provinces. Recently, Mingxin Minsheng and other companies in Sanhe County, Guizhou, have been mining [illegible], but the output is not large, and the Guizhou Mining Bureau is in progress.</p>

<h3>After the British Attitude Softens, Japan Becomes More Rigid: The Foreign Ministry Denies Mistreating British Nationals; Japanese Troops in Tianjin Insist on a Thorough Resolution</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Tokyo, 21st] According to Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita informed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, yesterday afternoon that the Japanese government could not agree to the British request to cease searching British nationals in Tianjin and inspecting food in the area.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Tokyo, 21st] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry denied that British nationals in Tianjin were being treated unfairly by the Japanese side, stating that, according to official information received, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have not shown any preferential treatment to nationals of the United States, Germany, or Italy. The Japanese authorities have not taken any violent actions against British nationals. Rumors that three British men were stripped naked and that one British woman was violated are untrue and are purely "malicious anti-Japanese propaganda," as women and children are all searched by female police officers. As for the entry of vegetables and food into the concession, the Japanese side has not obstructed it.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 21st] Recent reports regarding the Far East situation still lack concrete details. Reports from Tokyo state that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita held talks with British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie for over an hour. It is said that Arita expressed his willingness to handle the Tianjin dispute as a local incident. According to the "Every Evening Telegraph," the British Ambassador proposed a plan to resolve the Tianjin dispute locally. It is said that the Japanese government has agreed to negotiate based on this principle. However, the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin firmly believe that if the dispute is to be resolved, the entire issue of the British concession in Tianjin and British concessions in China must be addressed simultaneously, making it a difficult issue.</p>
<p>[Reuter's London, 21st] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today in response to questions, "The blockade of Tianjin and the searching actions by the Japanese continue to exist. Four British nationals have been stripped and searched. However, according to a recent telegram from the Consul-General in Tianjin, such incidents have not occurred again. As for the food issue, there is still a large quantity of rice and wheat, and it appears that the entry of food into the concession from outside is not prohibited, but it is still subject to Japanese searches. Shipping has also seen significant progress, and British ships are not being prevented from sailing. Ambassador Craigie has raised several incidents that have occurred since the blockade of Tianjin with the Japanese Foreign Minister, who has agreed to investigate them in detail. The position of the Japanese government has not yet been clearly stated, and it is expected that there will be a new report tomorrow. The majority of the British garrison in North China is now concentrated in Tianjin."</p>
<p>[Reuter's London, 20th] Foreign Secretary Halifax, in his first report to the House of Lords this afternoon on the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, expressed a glimmer of hope for the current Anglo-Japanese government negotiations. Halifax, when mentioning that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, had issued a "strong protest" to the Japanese authorities, said that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had taken note of this and was investigating the matter. Craigie is currently working hard to clarify the situation. At the same time, Halifax himself had discussed the matter with the Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu on Sunday. The Foreign Secretary continued, "The British government believes that the Japanese government, like the British government, does not wish to expand the scope of the dispute or further complicate the current extremely difficult situation. At the same time, we are deeply aware of the repercussions of this dispute on other British concessions and the public sphere in China." Halifax then repeatedly and solemnly stated that Britain maintains the closest contact with the US and French governments. After explaining the causes of the dispute, Halifax said that the British military authorities have taken all possible defensive measures to ensure security. Due to the strict inspection at the entrance of the concession, the import of perishable food into the concession is intermittent. It is said that the market near the French concession is still functioning normally.</p>
<p>[Reuter's London, 20th] Conservative MP Moore will launch a debate on the China situation in the government's Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday, with a special focus on the Tianjin issue.</p>
<p>(Reuter's London, 20th) British government legal advisor Sir Arthur Onslow condemned in Laverstock today, saying that it would be absurd to pretend that the current blockade of Tianjin is not a direct threat to the heart of Britain. This threat may have been conspired by those who feel that Britain is a major obstacle in their path to dominating the world. Arthur Onslow further stated that they never forget their compatriots who are suffering insults and difficulties in Tianjin. The Conservative Party's tradition of solidarity can strengthen the Party members' conviction that Britain, in the past or in the future, will never succumb to the current threats, no matter the generation.</p>
<p>[Reuter's London, 21st] The "Daily Mail" commented on the Tianjin incident today, saying, "Economic retaliation by Britain will surely be effective. Japan's provocative actions in Tianjin are equivalent to their tactics of abusing submarines, poison gas, and breaking contracts in an attempt to salvage their war losses. We must not compromise on this provocation and must respond with the most resolute and clear means."</p>
<p>[Reuter's London, 21st] The Times said in an editorial today, "The Japanese military authorities in North China are attempting to transform the local Tianjin incident into a broad issue concerning general policies. Therefore, the current situation in Tianjin remains chaotic. Before the purpose and means of Japan's China policy are determined, we can only speculate on the future development of the Tianjin dispute. The recent declaration by US Secretary of State Hull shows that although the US government is not directly involved in the Tianjin incident, it cannot ignore the widespread expansion of the incident. The initiation of the Tianjin incident is clearly directly related to Britain and Japan, but after its expansion, it is in fact opposed to all foreign concessions and treaty rights in China. This move will intensify the opposition of various countries to Japan's policies, and the degree of opposition may not be known by the Japanese military."</p>
<h3>US Congressmen Advocate Thorough Investigation of Submarine Incidents: Whether Due to Espionage Activities; France Prepares to Rebuild the Phoenix</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Washington, 20th] Senator Barbour introduced a proposal to the Senate today requesting the appointment of a congressional committee to investigate whether the sinking of the American submarine "Squalus," the British submarine "Thetis," and the French submarine "Phoenix" were due to terrorist activities. The proposal also requested that the congressional committee investigate the activities of foreign spies in the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Paris, 20th] French Leader Daladier declared in the Senate today that the French government has decided to rebuild a submarine similar to the "Phoenix," which was lost off the coast of Vietnam last week, and will still name it "Phoenix."</p>
<h3>British Shipping Tycoon Sir Owen Philipps Dies</h3>
<p>[Reuter's London, 21st] Shipping magnate Sir Owen Philipps died here today at the age of forty-nine.</p>
<h3>Poland Denies Papal Envoy Offered a Plan to Mediate Danzig</h3>
<p>(Reuter's Vatican City, 20th) According to official reports, the special envoy sent by the Vatican to Warsaw, Monsignor Cortesi, spoke today with the Secretary of State of the Vatican. His trip to Rome was specifically about the ordination of seven new bishops of Poland. According to other reports, Cortesi had received a response regarding the Pope's recent suggestion to resolve the Danzig and German-Polish problems peacefully, but Poland strongly denied that Cortesi was carrying any plans from Polish Foreign Minister Beck.</p>
<h3>Poland, the Sea, and Northern Europe: An Analysis of the Stumbling Block in Anglo-Soviet Negotiations (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Since April, Anglo-Soviet negotiations have become major news in the newspapers. However, day after day, stopping and starting, talking and retalking, three months have passed, and the Soviet Union has made two proposals, and Britain has sent three plans - recently, it is rumored that Britain sent a new plan, which would make it four. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also unfortunately lost his official position - but the phrase "Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been completed" still cannot be seen in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Chamberlain said in the House of Commons in response to questions: "There are still several focuses in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Among these focuses, the most important and the most noteworthy is naturally the guarantee issue of the Baltic countries. The Soviet Union is insistent on guaranteeing these small countries repeatedly, while Britain has expressed that it is not necessary for those small countries themselves, but those small countries themselves are shouting up: "We will maintain our neutrality on our own and don't you need to guarantee us".</p>
<p>Why is the Baltic issue so messy? Here, let's offer a little bit of fact-breaking information.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>First, let's see why the Soviet Union must volunteer to guarantee the Baltic countries.</p>
<p>This is fundamentally not a political or diplomatic issue, but entirely a military technical issue.</p>
<p>Now, let's open a map of Europe and look at the Baltic Sea and Northern Europe.</p>
<p>We all know that the Soviet Union is a complete continental country. For hundreds of years, she has been working hard on opening up seaports. However, up to now, there are only two usable military ports, Vladivostok in Asia and the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea. And the Baltic port is especially important. The Soviet European fleet is concentrated there.</p>
<p>However, if we really analyze it, the Baltic Sea is really a dead sea. It only has one outlet - the North Sea. Therefore, its fate is in fact controlled by the powers in the North Sea.</p>
<p>This fact was already revealed in the last World War. Therefore, during the peace conference, it was stipulated that the German territory along the Baltic coast should remove military equipment, and the Kiel Canal between Germany and Denmark, and the Øresund Strait between Denmark and Sweden, should be open to international navigation and prohibited from being fortified.</p>
<p>However, after Hitler came to power, the peace treaty became a piece of waste paper. Cannons were already installed on the German territory along the Baltic coast. The Kiel Canal is also being actively expanded and raised bridges to allow the largest German cruisers to pass through. And Heligoland Island, which is located in the North Sea and controls the western entrance of the Kiel Canal, which was also demilitarized after the war, has now become a German naval base again.</p>
<p>Denmark and Germany are only separated by a canal, and the Nazi poisonous knife cannot be resisted. Therefore, not only has the management right of the Kiel Canal completely fallen into the hands of Germany, but also the western border of Denmark, facing Britain, has been forced to install German cannons. The meaning of this is: British Navy, please don't come over.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Germany's expansion in the Baltic Sea and Northern Europe is becoming more and more fierce. He asked the four Nordic countries to sign non-aggression treaties. Although he was rebuffed, he will not stop. Now he is encouraging Denmark to fortify the Øresund Strait between Sweden and Denmark. Sweden is naturally doing its best to oppose this. However, although Sweden is a country that works hard to oppose the Nazis, she is still a small country. If there is no strength of others to back it up, it will sooner or later succumb to the swastika flag. If Sweden unfortunately succumbs and the Øresund Strait is fortified, becoming Germany's world, then the Soviet fleet in the Baltic Sea will be suffocated inside.</p>
<p>Further east is Memel. Overnight, Hitler made his envoy to take it back. It is a good deep-water port; Germany is preparing to establish a submarine base there, which is a great threat to the Soviet fleet staying in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>From Memel, further north is the Åland Islands, another important place. This island is located between Sweden and Finland. In 1921, the two sides agreed that the island would be neutral forever and not fortified. However, in January of this year, forced by the situation, the two countries also decided to set up fortifications there.</p>
<p>This action is naturally a resistance to Germany's activities in Memel. However, Hitler didn't care and instead publicized it in the newspapers. The meaning of this is: you set up the fortifications first, and in two days, I'll take them for my use.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in the next war, the Åland Islands will be a must-have place for Germany and the Soviet Union. And whoever seizes it has the hope of dominating the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>These changes in the Baltic Sea are all things that make the Soviet Union very headache. But the Soviet Union will never sit still and wait for death. She also has her methods.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Military Conference to Be Held in Singapore Starting Today</h3>
<p>High-ranking officials from both countries gather in the Far East to discuss cooperation between land, sea, and air forces</p>
<p>[Reuter's Singapore, 21st] The Anglo-French military cooperation conference in the Far East will be held here tomorrow. The British representatives include Admiral Sir Percy Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the China Station; Air Vice-Marshal J. E. A. Baldwin, Air Officer Commanding British Air Forces in India; Air Vice-Marshal Sir P. H. L. Playfair, Air Officer Commanding British Air Forces Far East; General Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Commander of British Land Forces in China; and senior military officers and staff from India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, and Hong Kong. The French representatives include General Martin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in the Far East; Admiral Doughty, Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy; and Colonel Duvic. A total of sixty British and French officers will participate in this important conference. The conference has long been planned and it has a special significance that its held at a time of recent developments. The United States and the Netherlands are not represented at this conference, but given their interests in the Pacific, the United States and the Netherlands must maintain close contact with the views of Britain and France.

<h3>Polish People Boycott Italian Goods</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 21st] Polish public organizations promote a boycott of Italian goods in cities and towns throughout the country, prevent people from going to Italy, and implement economic sanctions against Italian expatriates.

<h3>Shoe King Establishes New Factory in Germany</h3>

<h3>Roosevelt Supports Revising the Neutrality Act:</h3>
<p>Revoking the order to embargo arms and increase the contribution to peace</p>
<p>[Reuter's Washington, 20th] President Roosevelt said in a meeting with journalists today that Congress would adjourn only after passing the Neutrality Act. He believes that the most important provision of the Act is to rescind the order to embargo arms to belligerent nations, which will enhance America's strength for peace. He said that the reason why he did not want to delay this step was very clear. If a war breaks out after Congress adjourns, it would be difficult for the United States to adopt a neutrality law that would not be considered to favor one side.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Negotiations May Make Progress Within Days: No Meetings This Week; British Representative Awaiting New Instructions</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Moscow, 20th] British Special Envoy Strang and the British and French Ambassadors continued to discuss the Tripartite Agreement today, but they have not yet met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this week and are still awaiting new instructions from London.</p>
<p>[Reuter's London, 20th] According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, informed sources are now more optimistic about the progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. The recent Soviet memorandum is being studied, and the views of both sides are gradually converging. It is believed that the next meeting of the British and French Ambassadors and Strang with Molotov, if no other unexpected events occur, will be the best opportunity in principle to clarify different points of view. Once agreement is reached, they will immediately proceed to draft the text of the agreement, which may take some time, but according to informed sources, the future is extremely optimistic.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Moscow, 20th] Tass has officially denied the German claim that the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement has been delayed due to the Soviet Union's insistence on providing guarantees for the Soviet Far Eastern border, stating that the news is unfounded and fabricated.</p>
<h3>Shiratori Returns to Italy; Rumors of Promotion in His Home Country</h3>

According to Japanese sources here, Shiratori will soon be transferred back to Japan to take on an important position, so he is only making a temporary stay in Rome.</p>
<h3>US Protest to Japan to Be Published in Full: More Than 150 Cases Since the Outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today confirming that the US Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, following instructions from the State Department, visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry again on Monday. The first visit concerned the situation on Gulangyu, and the second concerned the continued bombing by Japanese aircraft of American property in China. In addition to protesting the bombing incident, the US Chargé d'Affaires also requested the Japanese government to agree to publish the full text of the protests made by the United States regarding this issue. Hull added that, to his knowledge, the US Chargé d'Affaires had not yet mentioned the Tianjin issue to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The full text of the protests made by the United States to Japan regarding the bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft will be published by the State Department in the coming days. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there have been more than 150 cases of American property in China being threatened or damaged by Japanese aircraft bombings, including more than 24 cases since June 1 of this year.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>US Mediation of Tianjin Case</h3>
<p>The Tianjin incident is a planned anti-British movement by Japan, as well as a planned act of intimidation against Britain. Therefore, in this action, it seeks to avoid any involvement with the United States and does not hesitate to send frequent veiled flirtations.</p>
<p>However, the fact is that whether Britain adopts a compromise or a resistance policy, the outcome of the incident cannot but affect the United States, France, and other countries, which cannot be denied. To be more specific, Japan's attack on the Tianjin concession actually includes the role of American power in the Far East. Although there are some contradictions in the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East, since the arrogance of Japanese aggression has risen, and even after the Japanese forces are tolerated in the future, the interests of Britain and the United States have largely converged, that is, they are inevitably forced to withdraw from the Far East together due to the development of Japanese power.</p>
<p>Currently, Britain's foreign policy, not only in the Far East, but throughout the world, is ××××××, while the United States' policy, on the contrary, is increasingly acquiring a decisive significance. Therefore, we do not want to be surprised that the British government has adopted a "pacification" policy, but we should pay attention to how the United States has sent out the message of "mediating the Tianjin case"! We believe that the United States will not fall into Japan's conspiracy, but we hope even more that the United States' active attitude will certainly promote and help the British people to promote their government to become actively together!</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>No Retreat</h3>
<p>— Hui Zhaojun</p>
<p>That night of March 15th, the artillery fire was extremely fierce. The newly full moon was shaken and quivering incessantly. The forests of Dawu Mountain rustled in response, and the spring leaves on the tree trunks looked as if they were stained with fresh red blood.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, a pillbox torn apart by bombs lay prone. Inside and around the pillbox, sandbags were piled up, leaning against each other. The heads of the soldiers that peeked out resembled the faces of clean-shaven Han men.</p>
<p>A heavy machine gun, swinging its heavy head, squinted at the × people. Was it laughing mockingly?</p>
<p>"Ah yo!" A sharp bullet, like a shooting star, pierced through the back of the machine gunner. With a miserable cry, he fell to the side, but another brave warrior immediately and nimbly crawled over to take the place of the fallen.</p>
<p>"Comrade, how are you?" the platoon leader asked in a low voice, using his hand to press tightly on the wounded man's wound, stopping the gushing and beautiful blood.</p>
<p>"It's nothing! Quickly, point the gun at the × people! We must meet again, 'death' is commonplace." The dying man had a smile on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>The upper lip of the pillbox slantedly revealed the mouth of a small cannon. Hanging from the muzzle was a tuft of lush green leaves, like a beard. Because the × people's planes were too crazy, the brothers had converted it into an anti-aircraft gun. The gunner's entire body was covered in earth, and under the shadow of his polished helmet, he was holding a very thick book, his cheeks moving as he recited.</p>
<p>The heavy sound of the engine gradually approached. The boundless sky was inlaid with three moving red lights, flying diagonally and quickly in a 品 shape. The gunner threw away the book in his hand, and the thing followed by firing. It was truly a good thing, as a burst of red light smashed the dark and heavy air. The three red lights immediately went out, with lovely sparks rippling in the middle. The sound of the engine gradually faded away, and the thick book returned heavily to the shadow of the gunner's helmet, as he continued reciting!</p>
<p>The ridge of Dawu Mountain was extremely steep, and covered with moss, very much like a large green top hat. A tank patrolling at the foot of the mountain seemed to see × people ambushing halfway up the mountain, and so it bumped and struggled upwards. Looking closer, it turned out to be a row of straw men. The tank paused, greatly angered. Just as it hesitated, a burst of laughter suddenly came from the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>"Stupid thing, come up and play!" At a distance of one hundred yards from the tank, a sentry in a grey cloth uniform stood straight. His left arm had been injured, but the joy of "resisting the war" made him forget what wounds and pain were. He was laughing and shouting.</p>
<p>The tank chased after him, and our sentry ran around the mountain path, sometimes using a fallen tree to block the way, causing "it" to flip over on its back, and sometimes firing two shots at "their" rear end. The tank's machine gun roared angrily, but only struck down protruding rocks and verdant trees.</p>
<p>After supporting for more than two hours, the sentry's legs were a little sore. He jumped off the slope and lay on his back to rest, but the "stupid thing" was still constantly spinning around in circles. Its huge heart was thinking, "The × people have been eliminated, I must have a good time."</p>
<p>This was a battalion of loyal and brave soldiers, who, in an inferior situation, were dealing with the robbers by resisting the invasion. Although their numbers had been reduced from more than three hundred to over one hundred, their indomitable spirit became greater day by day. Although the road behind had been cut off, if they were willing to put down their guns, they could detour and retreat into the border region, but they were unwilling. They said, "The gun is the life of a soldier! The life of the country! The life of four hundred and fifty million compatriots!"</p>
<p>"Brothers," the battalion commander stood up and said to everyone that night of March 15th, "Tonight, we suddenly received an order from above, asking us to retreat – retreat into the border region, disarm, and receive protection! What are everyone's opinions? Are you willing? Or unwilling?"</p>
<p>"Unwilling! We will fight on!" A burst of majestic roar!</p>
<p>"So many of our brothers have already died, let us all die here together!" Another huge chorus.</p>
<p>"Brothers! Since everyone's opinion is 'unwilling to retreat,' then we must continue to fight! Fight! Fight! Dawu Mountain is 'ours'! The pillbox is 'ours'!" The battalion commander raised his left hand and shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>The moon of March 15th gradually bid farewell to the world again. The sky was still the same red as blood, and the war continued to unfold vigorously.</p>
<h3>Falling Behind Life</h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>Literature stands at the forefront of social life. "Falling behind life" is undoubtedly a major shortcoming in a specific literary movement or in the creative practice of a specific writer. In many forms of literary movements throughout history, literature has participated in the development and struggle of the entire society as a portrayal of life and a reflection of life. If there is a work, or a writer, that cannot move forward with the changes and development of social life, but falls far behind life, then it will be alienated from the entire literary movement and social movement, becoming the dregs of literature.</p>
<p>A writer who is most capable of depicting the living struggles in society does not merely peek in the dark or investigate the aspects of social life from the sidelines. He must, primarily, throw himself into the entire social life, participate in all the battles of the masses, and from this discover the inner layers of life and grasp the truth of life. Therefore, a great literary work must be created by a writer who is deeply immersed in the source of life. If a writer loses the nourishment of life, that is, if he is confined to a narrow range of life, cannot discuss life, and is unwilling to participate in life, so that he falls behind life, then it will be impossible for his own work to reflect a broad picture of reality and write about numerous characters. Even if he has excellent literary skills and astonishing talent and imagination, he will at most be able to create some works that have only formal beauty but no actual content.</p>
<p>In our country today, there are many such writers. They themselves are falling behind life. The actual objective reality is at a very distant distance from them. The themes of their creations have become very weak due to the poverty of their own lives. Their writing brushes cannot but be limited to a certain field, and their vision cannot but remain on a certain range. Their writing activities cannot but constantly seek help from the trivial matters and details around them. These people, who only draw writing water from their own past lives and present personal lives, are indeed bound to fall into the predicament of creative poverty in the face of the current national revolutionary reality of our country. What is extracted from this predicament of life cannot only fail to be consistent with the development of the entire national revolutionary movement, but even greatly hinders the progress of this movement and becomes a superfluous burden. This is undeniable, it is the defect of our literary movement today, and it requires all our writers to deeply reflect on it, recognize it, and correct it.</p>
<p>Within our motherland today, all aspects of social life have undoubtedly undergone immeasurable changes. The flames of the Anti-Japanese War overflowing across the vast land of the country have turned millions of people into heroic fighters and countless towns and villages into revolutionary battlefields. The enemy's invasion and humiliation on our country's land has caused countless fathers, sons, brothers, spouses, and friends to be separated and lost, and has caused millions of peaceful people to leave their homes and become refugees, leading to countless famines and countless deaths. This enormous change in life is precisely the richest treasure for our literature. Writers can grasp the most moving themes from here and write the most excellent works from here. However, as the Soviet Gilbordin said, "Life has changed, and to tell the truth of life, artists must not fall behind life. They should see the pace of life in flesh and concreteness, know the state of the newly formed typical, and know the new typical people. Then, we can accurately depict all aspects of life in our country today, which is undergoing drastic changes, and reflect the entire picture of our country's life."</p>
<p>In order to create great and moving art, in front of a life of upheaval, artists must never fall behind life. He must adopt a deep and passionate attitude towards life, throwing himself into the revolutionary life of the war of resistance. Only in this way can his artistic practice keep pace with the objective life of the war of resistance, strengthen the moving power of his artistic works, and enable the combat function of his literature to be infinitely deepened and expanded. We must know that being outside the upheaval of life and treating one's own objects of description with a lack of passion is the first thing that causes artists to fail!</p>
<p>Life has changed, let us delve into the core of this change, and throw ourselves into the torrent of this change. As for "driving behind life," let it become an old saying!</p>

<h3>"China Travel" Cantonese Troupe's First Shot: "Five Rams City" to be Performed Tonight</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>At the Queen's Theatre, Fundraising for Lingnan University Student Union Disaster Relief</p>
<p>"It's good, but we don't understand what they're saying!" - This is the unanimous sigh of many Cantonese-speaking overseas Chinese in Hong Kong after watching Mandarin dramas. Although it is much better than the phenomenon of "dramas are worthless" in the past, it is still a pity that it has not penetrated the broad masses.</p>
<p>After the reconstruction of "China Travel," they are actively struggling, eager to carry on the past and forge ahead, and do something grand. Therefore, in addition to enriching the original lineup, they have also established a Cantonese troupe, which is on par with the Mandarin troupe. This kind of attitude is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Originally, it is not without shortcomings for dramas to be performed in local dialects; however, in the enlightenment movement of dramas, and in the current stage of winning over audiences as targets for national salvation propaganda, using Cantonese to deeply reach the broad masses as a tool to improve the audience's level may not be a transitional method that should be adopted at this time and place.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when "China Travel" participated in the public performance of "Before Dawn" at the Lee Theatre, the play "Atonement" used both Mandarin and Cantonese simultaneously, which aroused the interest of the audience. Tonight, the public performance of "Five Rams City" at the Queen's Theatre is entirely in Cantonese, which is the first shot of the "China Travel" Cantonese troupe.</p>
<p>This first shot was released after their painstaking rehearsals. They are performing for the Lingnan University Student Union to raise funds for disaster relief, and their spirit of actively serving the public is also worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>The script of "Five Rams City" is a national defense script that has been slightly changed in location from "Our Hometown," which was collectively created by Xia Yan, Hong Shen, Zhang Min, etc. The content is tense, vivid, and addresses the needs of this time and place. It tells us that returning to the provincial capital to be obedient citizens is not something that spirited nationals do, unless they have the ability and determination to go back and take on great tasks.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when "China Travel" was having its final rehearsal, the reporter had the opportunity to preview it. The spirit of serious work of all their members showed the bright future of "China Travel." What is especially inspiring is the members who are working hard, like workers, to make props and scenery; Mr. Zhang Xuefeng, who not only designs the stage sets, but also directs the play; and Tang Huaiqiu, who plays the factory accountant and speaks very beautiful Cantonese. This rare role will surely win the audience's favor tonight.</p>
<p>The development of the plot of "Five Rams City" is roughly like this:</p>
<p>Wang Zuzhang is a wealthy household in Guangzhou. After Guangzhou fell, the whole family fled to Hong Kong. However, he and his eldest son Jinwen and eldest daughter-in-law Li Baozhen are not used to life in Hong Kong. They always feel that Hong Kong is meaningless and always want to return to their fallen hometown. However, Jinwen is afraid that his younger brother Zhongwen will cause trouble if he goes back, so he asked Zuzhang and Zhongwen to agree on three conditions: first, he cannot go to school; second, he is not allowed to stay in Guangzhou and must go to the countryside; and third, he is not allowed to associate with "undesirable" people. Zhongwen is a patriotic and passionate young man. He originally wanted to return to his hometown to do some work to save the country, so even though the conditions were so harsh, he agreed.</p>
<p>Wang Zuzhang and his family returned to their occupied home, but the situation there disappointed them very much. It had completely become a world of × people and traitors. The × people occupied one of their factories and asked a traitor named Yin Jiaming to force them to sell the factory at a low price. The × people also forcibly occupied their ancestral graves and built an airport, so Wang Zuzhang could not transport his wife, who died in Hong Kong, to the provincial capital for burial. Wang Zuzhang became ill from anger because of this. Wang Jinwen could only drown his sorrows with wine at home every day. Only Zhongwen recognized clearly that being an obedient citizen was not something that spirited people did. Therefore, he resolutely joined the guerrillas and contacted many puppet soldiers and police to prepare for an uprising to recover the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Yin Jiaming repeatedly forced Wang Jinwen to secretly sell the factory behind Wang Zuzin's back, but Jinwen procrastinated and never dared to agree to him. On the last day, Gu Jiaming came to urge Jinwen again, and happened to meet Wang Zhongwen, who had returned home to be the inside support for the guerrillas' attack on the city that day. Yin Jiaming had long wanted to capture Zhongwen and go to claim credit, so he suddenly took out a pistol, disarmed Zhongwen, and prepared to escort him out. Fortunately, another guerrilla, Liu Qian Sheng, came with Zhongwen, and he subdued Yin Jiaming with a bizarre method and tied him up. At this time, Liu Qian Sheng, a guerrilla posing as a fake secret agent, came and helped Zhongwen to get rid of Gu Jiaming and helped Zhongwen to launch an uprising.</p>
<p>When they were about to launch the uprising, the soldiers had already been prepared. They resisted the danger. Wang Zuzhang thought of the hatred that the × people had given him, grabbed a gun and rushed out, was seriously injured, and died. Wang Jinwen also sacrificed heroically at the same time. Zhongwen and Baozhen finally fought out and saw the guerrillas recover their hometown.</p>
<p>— This story is exactly what the Cantonese-speaking overseas Chinese dream of pursuing; it is also the new fate of Guangzhou in the near future. The actors are very skilled, and the lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Character Actor</p>
<p>Wang Jinwen……Li Heng</p>
<p>Li Baozhen……Deng Zhujun</p>
<p>A Si……Xu Man</p>

<h3>Health Authorities Call on Residents to Participate in the Eradication of Tuberculosis Campaign, Approximately 5,000 People Died from Tuberculosis Last Year, Anyone is Susceptible to Infection</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease. In this bustling city, where people are densely populated and the air is not fresh, it is particularly susceptible to infection. Therefore, the mortality rate is increasing day by day. For the sake of the health of the citizens, the health authorities are constantly urging residents to be careful about their diet and take precautions to protect public health. Now, they have issued an article entitled "Tuberculosis" to call on residents to cooperate.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis</p>
<p>In 1938, nearly 5,000 people died in Hong Kong from tuberculosis or pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Its scourge affects both men and women, young and old, equally.</p>
<p>This disease infects people in all stages. All people, regardless of race or class, can be infected by this disease. However, most of the dead are unemployed or low-income Chinese.</p>
<p>There are thousands upon thousands of patients. According to this estimate, for every death, there are always five or six, or eight, or even ten patients who are still alive but are also suffering from the pain of this disease.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is actually caused by germs or toxins invading the human body. Germs or toxins are sometimes scattered in the air or in food. All people can inhale them into their bodies through breathing and eating. In addition, there are other ways to contract the disease, but those who contract it are relatively few.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the history of this disease is generally as follows: poor people live in small rooms or on beds, where light and air are difficult to penetrate. The food they eat daily also lacks nutrients. Due to the carelessness of those suffering from tuberculosis, they spit phlegm everywhere, causing germs or toxins to float in the wind after the phlegm dries. They are inhaled into someone's lungs, and then one lobe of the lung begins to be corroded, and then it extends to another lobe of the lung, until the left and right lobes of the lung are slowly destroyed. Occasionally, it also invades other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Once a person is infected, germs or toxins are released with the phlegm when they cough. After the phlegm dries, it floats in the wind, and others inhale it, and then they contract the disease.</p>
<p>Anyone can be infected. Tuberculosis germs or toxins are harmful to people, regardless of their status. The phlegm spit by a small worker can infect a manager, and the phlegm spit by a wealthy person can also infect a poor person.</p>
<p>Other ways to contract tuberculosis include the transmission of tuberculosis germs or toxins to people through other routes, such as spoons, cups, and dishes that have the saliva of patients. Others who use them together or eat with patients are easily infected with the disease. However, in Hong Kong, transmission through breathing is more common.</p>
<p>Since the transmission of tuberculosis is like this, how should we try to prevent ourselves and others from being infected?</p>
<p>1. Try to enjoy sunlight and fresh air as much as possible. If you can do this, the harm of tuberculosis germs or toxins, although not completely eliminated, will be greatly reduced. Therefore, the windows and ventilation of our homes should be opened day and night to allow fresh air to enter.</p>
<p>2. The daily food should be simple food that is beneficial to hygiene and rich in nutrients, including meat, fresh fish, eggs, green vegetables, raw oil, and fresh fruits. As for rice, red rice is preferable, or at least one part red rice and three parts white rice.</p>
<p>3. Try to keep the body and residence clean. Ocean view and clean water have the same effect as sunlight and fresh air, and can restrain tuberculosis germs or toxins. However, be careful when sweeping the floor to prevent dust from flying up, because the dust may contain dried phlegm, leaving behind tuberculosis germs or toxins. Therefore, it is advisable to wet the floor with clean water or disinfectant first, and then sweep or wipe it with a rag dipped in clean water or kerosene.</p>
<p>4. Do not spit phlegm in public places, such as the floors of houses, sidewalks outside, trams, buses, trains, and ships, and publicize the disadvantages of spitting phlegm indiscriminately to encourage common compliance. If you must spit phlegm, you should spit it into a tissue or into a covered spittoon containing disinfectant.</p>
<p>5. If you are unfortunately infected with tuberculosis, you should seek treatment from a Western doctor as soon as possible. If the disease is not deeply rooted, the doctor's treatment can prevent it from worsening. If the conditioning is proper, there is still a possibility of recovery. As for whether to go to the hospital or stay at home for conditioning, the doctor will definitely tell the patient. If you stay at home, in order to prevent infecting family members and neighbors, you should try to live alone in a room, and the bowls, chopsticks, cups, and dishes needed for food should also be separated for your own use. You must never spit phlegm everywhere. If you want to spit phlegm, you can spit it on paper and burn it with fire, or spit it in a spittoon. The spittoon used should be covered and contain disinfectant. It should be cleaned at least once a day and poured into a water toilet or toilet bucket.</p>
<p>6. Anyone who has knowledge of how tuberculosis germs or toxins invade the human body, how they are transmitted from one person to another, and how to prevent them should fulfill their duty to inform those who do not know, and especially set an example, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>I sincerely ask people from all walks of life to participate in the campaign to eradicate tuberculosis and help the medical and health authorities to work hard to eliminate this disease. This is what we hope.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Express) Wu Dingxin, Speaker of the Guangdong Provincial Provisional Council, met with reporters on the morning of the 10th and said: (1) I will leave Shao for Hong Kong in two or three weeks to handle the end-of-term affairs of the National University. After the military affairs are over, I will still come to Shao to preside over the Provincial Council affairs. (2) The preparation for the establishment of the municipal and county councils has been requested by this Council to the Provincial Government to expedite the handling, but because the organizational regulations of the municipal and county councils have not been promulgated by the central government, they cannot be established within a time limit.

<h3>The × Army on Hainan Island is Being Transferred Elsewhere, Wu Daonan Plans to Annihilate the Enemy with the Li People</h3>
<p>[Xuwen Express] According to military news, the × army on Hainan Island has recently been boarding ships from Haikou and heading to other places, presumably to Guangzhou to provide reinforcements. As for the Qiong Island war, since Wu Daonan, the administrative commissioner of the Ninth District, arrived in Qiong, if the power of the Li people can be used well, it will greatly enhance the strength to annihilate the ×. He personally went to the Wuzhi Mountains to convene a meeting of the chiefs of various tribes, and explained in detail the situation of our resistance war and the atrocities of the ×. The chiefs were extremely angry about the × invading us and unanimously swore an alliance to participate in the resistance against the × and annihilate the stubborn bandits together.</p>
<h3>A Unit of the × Cavalry in Shilong Rebels, Skirmish with × Military Police</h3>
<p>(Shenzhen Express) More than 60 soldiers of the × cavalry Saito unit stationed near Zhusi Zhou on Zhongshan Middle Road in Shilong Town were originally intellectuals from Tokyo. Recently, they were forcibly conscripted to China to fight, and they have suffered a lot. For the past ten days, because their request to the × Chief Ariukawa Kiyoshi for unpaid salaries was unsuccessful, they were suddenly moved to hate war and asked the × Headquarters for leave, claiming illness and refusing to go out. The × Chief did not allow it and condemned them. The more than 60 × were very angry and suddenly whipped the war horses in the stables of Zhusi Zhou on the morning of the 18th and set them on fire. The × soldiers guarding the stables were unable to stop them and ran to the × Headquarters to report. After listening to the report, the × Chief immediately dispatched about 100 military police to surround the rebelling soldiers, intending to disarm them. A skirmish immediately broke out, with machine guns firing at each other. The situation was extremely chaotic for a time. After an hour of stalemate, the rebelling soldiers, unable to overcome the disparity in numbers, were all subdued. It was later found out that more than 20 of the rebelling × were killed, and the rest were all escorted to the × Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Qiong Island Recaptures Jiaji City Again</h3>
<p>More than 100 × Died, Remnants Fled Back to Qiongdong County Town, × Ambush at Nadas City, Major Fujita Killed</p>
<p>The County's Our Army Attacks the × and Achieves a Great Victory</p>
<p>(South Road Express) Our army in Dan County, Qiongxi, has repeatedly attacked the × in the past ten days and reaped huge military gains. The × in Nadas City in the county has been repeatedly defeated by our army, and the remnants of the × are still causing trouble and looting in various villages. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, more than 10 × military vehicles, carrying more than 100 soldiers, departed from Dan County for Nadas City, attempting to provide reinforcements and counterattack us. It was unexpectedly detected by our radio. The × Brigade of the Zhuang Chang Team cooperated with a unit near both sides of the highway, waiting for the × vehicles to pass in a file. They immediately threw hand grenades at the ×. The × soldiers were caught off guard and frantically fired their machine guns densely on both sides. After a fierce battle of about half an hour, the × was unable to resist and fled in a panic. Our army won a great victory in this battle. As a result, two × military vehicles were destroyed, and more than 10 × soldiers were killed. × Commander Major Fujita was killed by us, and one × platoon leader, Nakamura, was seriously injured. Our side only suffered one squad leader and more than 10 soldiers killed or wounded.</p>
<p>The × Commits a Crime in Jiaji and Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>After Jiaji City, Qiongdong, was recaptured by our army at the beginning of this month, the remnants of the × fled back to Qiongdong County Town to recuperate and replenish. The X have also sent troops to attack us. According to investigations, on the 13th and 14th, we engaged in a fierce battle with the × near Jiaji City. The × machine bombed us in cycles, dropping many bombs in the city. In order to avoid major sacrifices, our army retreated for a while. On the evening of the 14th, our army continued to send reinforcements to counterattack the ×. The battle was extremely fierce. After a fierce battle of three hours, the × was unable to resist and collapsed towards Qiongdong. Our army immediately recaptured Jiaji. The battle lasted two days and nights, killing more than 100 ×. The × are still retreating to a corner and actively replenishing, with a model of re-plotting. Our army has been strictly preventing them.</p>
<h3>The Han River Water Surged Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Chaoan Communication) The Han River water surged once a few days ago, and many fields along the embankment were flooded. The loss of early rice was extremely huge. The North Embankment Foundation Committee convened the fourth board meeting yesterday to discuss and decide on a number of matters in order to prevent future troubles. Suddenly, the river water surged again yesterday. The North Embankment is extremely important. The North Embankment Foundation Committee has established an inspection team to patrol day and night to prevent unexpected events.</p>
<h3>The × Army in Daliang was Airstriked by Us, Several × Barracks and Armories Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express] At 7:50 a.m. on the 17th of this month, our divine eagle team suddenly appeared over Daliang. The × woke up from their dreams and fled in a panic. Our aircraft team found the target and calmly dropped bombs, destroying the × puppet barracks in the county government area. Two bombs also hit the × armory. The flames soared into the sky, and the × soldiers fled for their lives, extremely embarrassed and suffered heavy losses. Our divine eagle team had achieved its purpose and safely flew back to its base.</p>
<h3>The × in Jiujiang Deliberately Created a False Impression, Traitors Discussed Ways to Deal with the Guerrillas with the ×</h3>
<p>(Nanhai Express) The × army entrenched in Jiujiang has been inactive recently, but because of its empty strength, it is preventing our attack. Recently, it has installed six or seven wooden cannons at the Shakou Railway Station and Xing'an Wharf, remotely facing the Heshun Haikou and Gulao garrisons of our army in an attempt to intimidate. Jiujiang recently dispatched more than 100 troops from the Takeokakawa unit to defend the Tunzhuxue Xianguan, but fearing an attack by our army, they are busy mobilizing. They have been pretending to be × with rubber mannequins and loading military vehicles on the Jiangfu Road, or coming or going, deliberately creating a false impression to conceal their empty strength. The Kiyokawa River × army in Jiujiang, due to repeated attacks by our guerrillas, is unable to cope with it and is extremely frightened. × Commander Ono specially convened the puppet maintenance association, the puppet chamber of commerce, and the so-called councilors (who were filled by traitors) on the 16th of this month at the Chamber of Commerce to hold a joint meeting to discuss ways to deal with our guerrillas and how to implement the administration and curb the anti- × mood of our people. However, there were no results on the above-mentioned issues.</p>

<h3>Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics</h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>2.  The difference between "stretching" and "striking" or "kicking": The action of "zhong" in old gymnastics, new gymnastics calls "striking" or "kicking." The action of "stretching" has no time limit; it can be fast, slow, forceful, or effortless, all of which are stretching. However, if the action of "striking" or "kicking" is not fast enough, it will certainly lose the effectiveness of "striking" or "kicking." If it is not forceful enough, it will certainly not be able to fulfill the mission of "striking" or "kicking." From this, we can understand that the difference in these actions is that the actions of "striking" or "kicking" are faster and more forceful than the actions of "stretching."</p>
<p>3.  The difference between "bending" and "pulling": We can see the difference between the two actions of "bending" and "pulling" from the words themselves, which is exactly the same as the difference between "stretching," "striking," and "kicking" above. Because if it is "pulling," it must be a forceful pull, otherwise the pull will not be established.</p>
<p>4.  Adding "vibrating" actions: This type of action is the most important one in new gymnastics, but it does not exist in old gymnastics. This type of action can be used to practice any part of the body. Even if the part cannot be directly vibrated, it can vibrate other parts to indirectly complete its mission. For example, the chest cannot have direct vibrating actions, but the vibrating actions of the arms can be used to indirectly achieve the effect of vibration. The function of this type of action can increase the number of movements within the same time, and can gradually increase the depth of its movement. For example, when the upper body vibrates forward and downward, the upper body can bend forward and backward once during the time of one breath, and the degree to which the upper body bends downward can also gradually bend lower and lower using the momentum of the downward vibration.</p>
<p>5.  More "circling" actions: Although "circling" actions sometimes exist in old gymnastics, they are performed very rarely, and are mostly for the wrists of the upper limbs and the ankles of the lower limbs. New gymnastics has circling actions for all parts of the body, the purpose of which is to increase the amount of exercise.</p>
<p>B. In terms of practice methods, the differences in practice methods can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>6.  The difference in fixed positions: Old gymnastics also has the use of fixed positions, but not every section has them, or uses the same position all the time. New gymnastics must first have a position, and then perform the action. Except for lower limb exercises, when performing upper limb, trunk, and other exercises, the lower limb positions are often the same half-open stance, in order to take the solid foundation of standing, which is easy to stabilize. Various actions are performed smoothly on a solid foundation, which is certainly better than the old gymnastics saying that one type of position cannot be used often, or that the feet cannot always be in the same position, which is completely opposite.</p>
<p>7.  The difference in continuous actions: The actions of new gymnastics, whether limbs or trunk, are continuous without stopping. There is absolutely no supporting one action for a long time like in old gymnastics, and then doing the second action. Therefore, its actions and actions are mostly rhythmic. It can be practiced to the playing of music, increasing the interest of the learners.</p>
<p>8.  The difference in direction changes: In old gymnastics, after performing one action on the left side, the same action must be performed immediately on the right side, or after performing one action with the left foot forward, the right foot must be immediately switched forward to perform the same action. In new gymnastics, for complex actions and actions that are inconvenient to change direction, the same number of actions is often performed in one direction before changing to another direction to perform the same number of actions. This practice method makes it easier to become familiar with repeating the same action in one direction, and can avoid the trouble of changing directions frequently, and the effect obtained is no different from changing directions frequently.</p>
<p>9.  The difference in neatness of actions: The actions of old gymnastics must be neat and uniform. For example, when bending the upper body forward, it is required to bend to 90 degrees, and all performers must bend to 90 degrees uniformly. Higher or lower is not allowed. New gymnastics is not like this. Any action must be done to the best of each individual's ability. For example, when bending the upper body forward, some people cannot bend any further after bending to 90 degrees, while others can bend to 100 degrees or more. Its requirement is that everyone should do their best. Those who can bend to 90 degrees should bend to 90 degrees, and those who can bend to 100 degrees should bend to 100 degrees. There is no fixed limit, and meaningless neatness is not sought.</p>
<p>C. In terms of amount of exercise, the amount of exercise in new and old gymnastics differs because the actions and practice methods differ.</p>
<p>10. The amount of exercise differs due to different actions: When we look at the actions of new and old gymnastics above, which are compared, such as "swinging" and "lifting," "pulling" and "bending," "striking," "kicking," and "stretching," once compared, it is obvious which has a greater and smaller amount of exercise. Although there is no comparison for "vibrating" and "circling" actions, vibrating actions can increase the number of movements within the same time and can gradually increase the depth of the movement. It has a large amount of movement and can be self-evident. For a type of exercise, the longer the diameter of its moving parts, or the larger the arc of the movement diameter, the greater the amount of exercise. "Circling" actions are movements along the largest arc of 360 degrees. The size of its amount of exercise need not be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>11. The amount of exercise differs due to different practice methods: The size of the amount of exercise is of course directly related to the actions, and also indirectly related to the practice methods. As mentioned earlier, the practice method of new gymnastics is continuous without stopping, which can increase the number of actions in the same time. For example, when doing the action of bending the upper body to the left and right with both arms bent upwards, old gymnastics must be (1) bending both arms upwards, (2) bending the upper body to the left, (3) returning to the posture of (1), (4) returning to standing upright, (5, 6, 7, 8) performing to the right. In eight breaths, the number of times the body actually bends is only once each to the left and right. New gymnastics is to perform the action of bending the upper body to the left and right, or vibrating the upper body downward to the left and right from the position of bending both arms upwards and the feet half-open. If it is bending, it must be a continuous bend of once to the left and once to the right. If it is vibrating, it must be vibrating two to four times to the left, and then vibrating two to four times to the right. In eight breaths, the upper body bends left and right eight times, which is four times more than in old gymnastics. Moreover, each of its actions has no fixed limit and must be done to the best of each individual's ability. In this way, the difference in the amount of exercise between the two is obvious.</p>
<p>D. In terms of muscle use, new and old gymnastics have the following two differences: 1. The difference in the adjustment of tightness and relaxation: In old gymnastics, when doing any action, the muscles are often tight and contracted from beginning to end. There is no opportunity to relax the muscles until a section of gymnastics is completed or during rest. New gymnastics must have tightness and relaxation for adjustment in one action. For example, when swinging both arms horizontally to the left and right, the muscles are contracted and tight when swinging to the left and right, and force is used. When swinging back to the front of the body and crossing, it is relaxed and effortless. In this way, with the adjustment of muscle tightness and relaxation, it will not become stiff and rigid dead muscles.</p>
<p>12. The difference between active and assistive movements: The actions of old gymnastics also have a distinction between active and assistive movements, but when it uses muscles, it contracts and tightens all parts, regardless of whether they are active or assistive. In new gymnastics, the muscles of the active part must be contracted as much as possible, and the muscles of the assistive part must be relaxed as much as possible. For example, in the old gymnastics action of extending the arms and straightening the chest, extending the arms is assistive and straightening the chest is active. However, when it extends the arms, the muscles of the arms must be contracted at the same time. New gymnastics uses arm back vibration to straighten the chest. The purpose of its arm vibration is to help the chest protrude, completely relaxing with free movement, and only the muscles of the chest are contracted. In this way, the muscle contraction focuses solely on the active part, and the contraction of the muscles in the active part can reach its extreme.</p>
<p>E. In terms of value, since ball sports became popular in our country, gymnastics has long lost its place in sports. The reasons why people criticize it are nothing more than saying that its actions are rigid, cannot arouse the interest of learners, cannot cultivate flexible muscles, and cannot cope with sudden changes in the environment. Its amount of exercise is small, cannot adapt to physiological needs, and cannot achieve the purpose of fitness. These reasons are not without cause when considering the gymnastics methods of the past. But what about new gymnastics? Are its actions rigid? Its actions are continuous and rhythmic, and the adjustment of muscle tightness and relaxation cannot be called rigid. Is its amount of exercise small? Its new actions such as swinging, pulling, striking, kicking, vibrating, and interlacing, and various innovative new mining methods, make its amount of exercise increase many times compared with old gymnastics. It is indeed lively, interesting, has a large amount of exercise, and is a physical examination that meets people's physiological requirements. It is enough to break all criticisms and can replace ball sports. I hope that the people of the country will promote it.</p>
