<h3 id="c1">中國抗戰與美國的獨立戰爭 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>中國駐美大使胡適博士，在紐約講演「日本在中國的侵略戰」以中國抗戰與美國獨立戰爭相比擬，詞意警闢，語多精采，因摘譯其演詞要旨，披露如左，一方所以紀念美國獨立革命，一方亦所以勗在繼續抗戰中之中國國民。</p>
<p>中國　在的抗戰，我認爲是一種革命戰爭，與美國獨立戰爭的意義相同，情形相似。當時華盛頓軍隊在福崎谷所遭遇的困苦，曾引起歷史家無限的同情與贊頌。那時正是嚴寒的冬天，兵士却沒有鞋襪穿，赤著足行軍，所過的地方，只見潔白的雪地上滿印著殷紅的血跡。華盛頓對國會的報告曾說；他現在只有二千多殘餘的隊伍，而且都是衣不蔽體，再沒有作戰的力量；每日因飢寒交迫而病倒的人，一天多似一天，醫院中住滿了傷兵與病兵，設備又簡陋得可憐，甚至缺乏草墊舖地，眼看著許多傷兵病死在冰凍的地上。</p>
<p>正在這危急萬分的關頭，英國却提出和議，　意無條件廢止一切不平等的法律。這這確是一個光榮的和平提議，如果當時美國開國者接受了這個提議，那末此後四年間的流血與犧牲，儘可以避免。但是這樣一來，他們將永遠失去更光榮的獨立，也將永遠不會右美洲合衆國出現於世界上。</p>
<p>那時美國開國諸公，毅然拒絕了這個和議條件、不屈不撓的再繼續抗戰了四年，在那血戰的　年中間，危難困苦的情况，正如在福崎谷度可怕的冬天一般。軍事上遭受無數次的挫折，喪失的領土一天天擴大，內部又時常發生料紛與困難，甚至通敵曹國的事也層出不窮。紙幣的價値，更是一落千丈。華盛頓自己也曾說：「買一車的粮食，需要一車的紙幣，」在一七八〇年初，紙幣一元跌到二分：到同年年底，紙幣十元，都只値一分。在這種情况之下，乓士的衣食，簡直無法維持。</p>
<p>可是情况無論如何險惡，華盛頓與他的同志却决不放棄抗戰。他們又經過了四年的艱苦奮鬥，終於在一七八一年的一月。在約克城獲得了最後的勝利。</p>
<p>從這樣看起來，當時華盛頓統率的美軍，其處境並不比今日抗戰的中國軍隊好多少。原來凡是革命戰爭，都是武力低劣的人民，爲理想與正義所激發，和武力優越的壓迫者與侵畧者作戰。其最後勝利，總是屬於被侵略者與被壓迫者的，因爲他們篤信主義，忠勇奮發，足以克勝一切的危難困苦！（一）</p>
<p>世界動向一週間　從廿八年七月二日至八日</p>
<p>公昭</p>
<p>（一）抗戰進入第三年度　我×對時形勢人變</p>
<p>從這一週起，中華民挨革命的抗日戰爭，開始進入第三年了。我們敬禮着在前綫浴血在後方奮鬥的民族戰士，我們哀悼若一切爲國家民族而犧牲的武裝與非武裝同胞，我們慶幸着經過艱苦危險之兩年的今日，已經看得見中華民族獨立自由幸福的遠景了！</p>
<p>英勇艱苦鬥爭的兩年，中華民族實現了空前的大團結大統一，建立並且鞏固了最後勝利之基礎的民族統一戰綫和抗戰建國綱領，開始等且發展了民主政治　全民族爲解放而鬥爭的總動員，逐漸的實現了政治，軍事，經濟，文化各部門工作的進步，提高了我們在國際上的地位，信譽，和力量，增强了民主和平　友邦反法西反侵略的統一戰綫，暴露並且增進了日本侵華軍事國内政洽和外交形勢的弱點，缺點，因難和危機。</p>
<p>這兩年，是中華民族在全世界革命史上和人類進化史上寫上了最光榮的一頁。蔣委員長和各領袖，在偉大的雙七抗戰建國節日，發表了許多重要文吿，指示我們：現在（一）×人方面，速戰速決的方針打斷了，『速和速結』的詭計失敗了，現在轉取『以戰養戰』的毒計，注力於佔領區的掃蕩和經營，同時進行試探投機性的正面進政，企圖達到不戰不和的局面。（二）國際方面，形勢已有曲折緩　　好轉，祗要我　堅持「以自力更生爭取外後的原則」，則國際同情援助將有更廣大的發展（三）我國方面，從全國範圍說，確已奠定勝利基礎只要在政略上堅持持久抗戰，反對中途妥協，發動全面戰爭，反對自我消耗；加緊團結統一，反對陰謀和挑撥，　要在戰略上堅持主動的全面的持久戰　增強前　戰爭力，擴大×軍後方戰鬥，加緊培養　反攻的决戰力量；　　利是會更快的到來的！</p>
<p>（二）　南北戰場同　報捷　日×後方一警告急</p>
<p>說到這一週來的抗戰軍事，也像天造地設一搬，透露出我軍必勝的先兆。</p>
<p>先說南方戰場，我們在×軍强佔汕頭之時，即已發動粤西粤北的大舉反政，這一週　有捷報，第一、反攻新會江鬥的我軍，都會一再　入城　，連日激戰，大瀏×軍，第二，北江　攻郁　，分路挺進，迫得×電向廣州狠　　竄，現在廣州已在我軍控制之下，至於嶺東方面，我軍仍在潮汕近郊與×激戰，連日襲擊潮汕　路，均獲勝利，不過×人對浙閩粤沿海，自浙之定海一直至　之北海，都在×艇艦「相機進迫」的威脅之下，這也不容忽視！</p>
<p>再設北方戰場，晉西×軍犯陜企圖已吿失敗，晉西南戰事則仍謬着，不通外蒙方面蘇蒙聯軍一週來迭創日×，我華北部隊乘機分路反攻，大　戰果，現在黄河北岸永濟風陵渡一帶？軍大部北開東竄，華北軍事，可望有更順利的進展了。</p>
<p>其次鄂皖贛湘各地，戰况雖無重大變化，但×後游擊戰爭，則已一般的大有發展，而鄂中京鐘路上，則更於本月一日再獲勝利，×兵五百，悉遭璨殺。</p>
<p>最後我們在×人後方的戰鬥，亦有新的進展，首先楚京滬平津一帶，擊游戰非常活躍，京滬路一週來多日不能通車，平津近郊亦時遭我某軍襲擊。此外，據中央社二日津訊，東北各地×軍反戰份子活躍，僞軍動搖反正　迭起，日僞軍對蒙挑釁以來，事件　　嚴重。而綏遠我軍，近來亦轉趨活　，我蒙漢各族軍民，正在密切聯合　　反攻。英小覷了　些小勝，要知道　　×後爲前方，積小勝為大勝」這是我們的制勝秘訣</p>
<p>（三）　汪精衛編排傀儡劇　蔣委長義討賣國奴前面曾經說到，日本　　　　企圖造成不戰不和書面，藉以鞏固和經營其强佔地區，要實現此計，少不得一個比較强力的漢奸政樣，於是汪逆精衛就自吿『忠勇』，爲日×趕排傀儡劇，據二日中央社滬訊，行將出現的僞中央傀儡組織，其名單擬定如次：</p>
<p>主席　汪逆精　街</p>
<p>財政　王逆　克敏</p>
<p>司法　　逆　康</p>
<p>外交　陳逆中孚</p>
<p>敎育　湯逆爾和</p>
<p>此外，又傳×爲協調南北傀儡政權歸係起見，又擬由汪在南京成立特種委員會由汪主席，籌備組織，聯合政府，而與梁逆鴻志，温逆宗堯，陳逆羣等進行協商。還要注意的：</p>
<p>一，仍擬潛用靑天白日旗，以欺騙民衆；</p>
<p>二，盜用「三民主義」的名義；</p>
<p>三，組織「反共國民黨」</p>
<p>四，組織「反共國民黨政府」，企圖吸收動搖，自私，和沒有自尊沒有自信力的敗類，爲注　賣國行動作支柱。</p>
<p>汗逆這種一和平』『反共』的陰謀，完全是替日×盡忠，是不待說了。這是我們全民族不願做奴隸的國民所不能容忍的，最高領袖蔣委員長，就在七七兩週紀念的諭告中嚴正指出汪逆及其一羣此種活動，爲喪心病狂，是「不想×人是已經自握了墳來　他自己，不顧國家，甘心爲×人殉葬」！我們今天還要注意，一般未作漢奸的甚至還站在「堂堂」名義之下的自私自利，昧却天良，喪失自信的吃磨擦飯發國難財的兇徒惡棍，却也在製造「和平」「反共」等　旗，響應汪逆的「招魂」—他們眞如蔣委員長諭吿所說「他們更要把光榮的民族跟他來歡殉葬品」—我們不能容忍。</p>
<p>（四）　反侵略高潮　起　英美蘇競相助我</p>
<p>由於我國上下一致　　　　　　持抗戰，我們在國際的信譽與地位日益提高，而國際援華運動，亦日益廣大與有力起來了。</p>
<p>爲了紀念中國抗戰兩週年，擴大援華運動。英國援華委員會，特爲　起「中國週」，　動英國輿論，共起援助我國，特爲此舉行日刊，定名「中國新聞」，並在五日舉行民衆大會，美國方面，多數主强援華的美人團體，亦於「七七」舉行「中國週」、七月七日、我僑胞舉行盛大遊行、由胡適之大使祖任領隊，美民主黨參議員湯　士及總工會等團體，也踴躍參加。</p>
<p>爲了遠東問題，蘇聯駐美大使奧曼斯基，發於上月卅日往訪美國務　　爾，華盛頓方面對此廠爲重視，認為對於蘇美關係，必有重大影響。據傳蘇大使會與赫爾檢討遠東局勢的進展，並　知美國對遠東是否採取傳統的政策，五時赫爾卽曾表示，「美國在外交上與他國合作之目的，乃在制止武力侵略」。叉蘇聯太平洋　隊，亦擬在海參　附近，舉行大規模的演習，其他海軍操演，則在黑海舉行，繼續英法新加坡軍　會　之後，美英兩國　遠東問題的開始採取協商步驟，自然更將使遠東反侵略運動更　發展。</p>
<p>（五）　蒙蘇　軍邊境殲×　華北關外×軍惶亂</p>
<p>這一週，外蒙蘇聯和僞　　境，發生了更劇烈的戰　，戰事的　　　日×，他們爲了轉移國內國際的視綫，爲了誘惑英國放棄援華和討好德意加緊助二，才不斷的發動對蘇對蒙的挑釁　。</p>
<p>然而日×　次挑釁是失敗了，第二，今日的外蒙古，已經是一個教會主義的國家。政治軍事經濟都有極大進步，外蒙古的民族，遠承成吉思汗以來的光榮傳統，近受　聯革命成功和大中華民族堅持團結抗日戰爭的感化，已　成爲遠東反侵略陣綫中華民族抗戰陣綫中最堅强的支柱之一，决不放任×人的　　而且决心加以無情的　擊了—第二，蘇聯早已堅决表示，對於外蒙，决　行互助協定的義務，出兵援助外　，打　任何侵略的勢力，因此，日×這次挑　，却招惹來了天大的災　，怕不僅是折　　兵，而已。</p>
<p>本月三日，日×　東軍宣布日軍二日在呼倫池南向蒙蘇軍開始　攻，戰事範圍較過去任何一次為大，　方均用坦克　　甲軍，砲兵，騎兵與飛機等，三日拂曉，日僞軍又以降空軍聯合進攻諾門軍，但全部潰退。而克魯倫河以東。　為　共聯軍所佔領，三日至五日，蒙蘇聯軍總反攻，不僅奪囘次爾潮東南，哈爾哈河西岸的隊　，並且殲殺日軍八百餘上，俘獲坦克摩五十輛，擊落日本飛機四十五架；蘇蒙軍則死一百，傷二百。損失坦克車二十五輛，飛機九架。</p>
<p>現在日×為蒙滿邊境情况嚴重，深感兵力不足，而國內又無兵可調，故又將華北×軍。抽　運用，連日由津浦綫北運及由天　開往　北的部隊，汽車汽油，坦克，大砲，軍用品甚多。而東北關東軍，又在加緊　　反戰運幼，爲取亦紛起反正殺×，日×在軍事上的困難是更加嚴重了。不過，這不是說對華軍事即將停，不，相反的，我們如不爭主動的積極作戰，則日×還將作投機的進攻。</p>
<p>（六）　東京談判下週開始　日人　大反英運動</p>
<p>日本準備着對英大肄誘惑的嚇詐技　的東京談判、終因英國朝野的一致反對而將延展至下週開始了、雖然雙方當局還正在積極佈置這一談判，但是英日在華利害的衝突，却因日×之獨霸遠東的陰謀而　加嚴重起來，在這一時期。日本的反英運動也就更加猖狂起來了。事實上，對於天津租界的封鎖旣越加嚴密，對英國在華利益的刦奪與破壞，對英國在華人民的侮辱亦越加無理，尤其是當本月四日英大使克萊琪訪晤日外相有田　商談判程序時，東京方面也　大了反英運動，日本軍部還　出狂妄要求說：「要求英國對中日事變改變認識」放棄援華態度。七月五日以後。東京等地一律舉行「反英運動「民衆」大會」各地　貼「打倒英國之××政策」『驅逐英國出支那』等無理標語。七月七日，東京英大使館前，又有日本暴徒百人示威，附近一帶又遍貼『英國人須退出亞洲大陸」等標語，同時日本首相平沿發表談話，竟謂，『談判應以英　眞正理解日本在遠東地位及其日的爲先决　　，談　　　　　如不　　于日本建設東亞新秩序，則不能眞正解决』，同日×陸相坂垣亦發荒謬的反英談話說，不論今後遭遇任何困難，必使東亞成爲東亞人之東亞，此種决意，將在援華之第三團面前，勇敢表現、决不有所顧總。</p>
<p>日×這樣敢於擴大反英，正由於事實上日英在遠東衝突之無法解决，也正由於英國之不能斷然放棄妥協政策。</p>
<p>（七）　張伯倫空喊反　掠　英法　談判　進展</p>
<p>一方面是日×在遠東的步步進攻，另一方面是德意在歐洲　削英法的勢力；尤其是，這一週來的但澤問題，表面稍爲沈寂，內與危機都是在　大，所有這些外力的進迫，已經更明白的，警吿英國，犧牲快到最後關頭了，和平妥協已會亡國了！</p>
<p>於是，張伯倫首相也不能不堅决聲明决心抵抗侵掠了—他在本月二日對全國廣播說：「吾人自身本屬和平分子，無意與任伺人衝突；惟外間不能誤會吾人絕無傾全國之力以抵抗侵略之决心。必要時，不論其爲對我人之直接侵掠，或爲對已獲吾人保證之國家的侵掠，吾人决以全力應付』，而對於日×由英外相哈立法克斯於七月七日正式吿知我顧維鈞人使，謂在東京談判中，關於任何主要問題，英國决不妥協。』</p>
<p>但是，英國政府的誠意，與實力，　在英國自身，多數有識人士，亦不能不表示懷疑的—只看英法蘇互助協定的談判吧。這本來是英國力圖自保東西兩方之安全並足以保衛東西各國和平的　法，但是英國政府始强未放棄『半截政策』未放棄利用及玩弄蘇聯的企圖，只有當情勢緊迫之際。態度才又好轉。</p>
<p>這一週來，英蘇談判本已有漸　成熱的徵兆了。但是英國又於三日突然提出反要求，要求蘇聯予荷蘭士以同樣保證，並伸展至業經英國允予保證之荷蘭，　馬尼亞，土耳其，希臘，比利時及葡萄牙等國。到了四日英方叉主張先發聯合寶言，暫　置保證問題。這在事實上只會使談判的眞正意義與力量為之削弱，尤其是使談判　　　延下去而不能立卽成功。而諉卸責任於蘇聯政府</p>
<p>這種情勢是不能繼續下去的，英國人　尤其是英國廣大的勞工已經一再有所　示。最近，他們又在加緊進行發動國際工人統一戰綫，以謀加緊各國工人與各國　求獨立自由的民族聯台，反抗法西斯侵略　這是我們所不能輕視的力量—我們要爭取，鞏固和發揮這　大的力量。</p>

<p>— 續昨第六版</p>
<p>三　說明中國抗戰必勝建國必成的理由</p>
<p>前節所說、是日本侵略必敗之理、但僅此還不能充足、明中國之抗戰必勝　　必成、因爲假若中與已身也有失敗的要素，其結果仍不可知、所以我理在更要向日本民衆、指示爲什麼我們能愈戰愈強、究竟甚麽是我們抗戰必勝建國必成　把握　固然、凡日本軍閥的敗　、都給我們增加了力量、然中國本身却另有積極的成功之要素、就是中華民族已有了統一的堅决的信仰——三民主義、關於此點、我想扼要的來說明一下、近代中國之最大困難、是自己不能統一、不能覺悟、不能解决自己的問題、而現在統一了、覺悟了、一切問題在思想上業已解决、　　解决得妥當、這就是說、中國業已確實統一於三民主義革命原則之下、而這就是我們抵抗　　奮鬥廷國的最大保障、</p>
<p>三民主義的眞諦</p>
<p>——中國的立國精神——</p>
<p>我　你們日本民衆務須認識中國革命、認　　　　義、這一點認不淸、將永　　　　　　問題的解答、你們大槪也知道、中國抗戰是由民族主義的精神訓練而來，這話是對的、然而解釋不够、我們全國軍民的抗戰决心、固然由於愛國精神、但我們的愛國、與佻們不同、日本民衆甚爲愛國、是我們認識的、但是你們的忠想、出不了國家主義的　國、在國弱之時、只求富强、旣强之後、專求發展，所以從愛國　而爲侵略主義、以致形成今天的日本、簡單說、自己愛國而不尊重其他民族同　愛國、並且仇　嫉視他人之愛國　自視甚尊、而視鄰沂民挨　卑、充滿了狹隘的狂妄的侵略思潮、故演成這兩年如此殘暴不人道的侵華戰事、中國却不然、我們信仰的是三民主義的民埃主義、我們民族主義的解釋、在前面已說過、是力求中國之自由平等、而同時尊重一切民挨的自由平等、換句話說、我們的思想、澈底是和平的、不是侵略的、自愛而愛人的這種精神、本來是中中文化的基本特色、只因中古以來、政治進化陷于停滯之中、以致這　　的和平精神、表現了消極散漫萎靡不振的流弊，滿淸末年，外患嚴重、國將不國、我先總理孫中山先生、這　大聲疾呼、喚起同胞革命建國、其思想是承　中國文化的正統、而融會近代世界　理的精　、及經各國革命的經驗。其結品而成者、就是三民主義、所以要認識民族主義、必須理解三民主義的全部、因爲其一貫而不可分、我先簡單吿訴你們、中國不是平常所謂國家主義、而是民族主義、其區別是中國雖爲自己自由平等而奮鬥、但决無自私或侵略的企圖、同時有整個統系的政治及經　上的理想與綱領、最簡單的講、政治是以民治民民民享爲依　、經濟是以平均地據節制資本及發展人民衣食住行的享受爲　領、前者規定在民權主義、後者規定在民生主義、這些綱領、都是發源于中國文化的固有思想、而博采近代西方思想的優點、取長棄短、冶而爲一、其目的要適合國家當前之需要、並保障民族永久之幸福、而最後達到世界大同之理想、所以三民主義的國際　、整個是和平的、不侵略的、同時是正義的、富于進化性的、簡言之、三民主義是革命的主義、</p>
<p>民十七以來形勢</p>
<p>——中國在躍進中——</p>
<p>中國是信仰三民主義正在建設途中的新與的國家、近代中國革命的障碍、實際以存在内部者爲重、中山先生一生奮　、就爲着喚起同胞，我們的同志們在失去了大的導師以後，雖然繼續努力、而國內及黨內思想上的障碍、依然發生不少、或者信仰不堅、與行為不符、而自民國十七年以來、我們政府由於外患内憂之交迫、對于幾多政治上經濟上應有的設施、許多未能做到所以我們自省實在缺點甚多、努力不够、然所欣幸者、一般國民、日有進步、在日本軍閥於兩年前大舉侵略之時、我們全國業已達到一致信仰三民主義、有了一致擁護革命建國的熱忱與認識，在那時候、業已普遍燃燒起來、爲國犧牲的精神、而有了絕對不受時間　化的意志、我們抗戰就是這統一的精神意志，而開始的</p>
<p>日本軍閥的兇殘</p>
<p>——加强抗戰意志——</p>
<p>現在抗戰兩週年了、我們　牲雖大、而進步更多、暴戾的侵略者，不但在火綫上盡其摧殘破壞之能事、在佔領地內對於我們非戰鬥員的男女老幼大羣、更行了違背人道的凌虐與殺戮、同時在我們前方後方，轟炸市街、殺害民衆、天天演着毫無理性的兇行、雖然、佔領區內還有很大很多的農村山村和魚港、是我們愛國民衆、爲游擊的據點、日本决沒有能力、也沒這麽多的兵力、可以消滅他們、但是交通　日軍所過的地方、我們同胞財產喪失了、家室毀滅了、許多城市鄉村都成瓦　了、軍民各界到此時、更不由得深切體認了個人與國家民族命運之絕對不可分離、更深切認識了日本軍閥的兇殘、因而更深切理解了三民主義的偉大、</p>
<p>中國人的日人觀</p>
<p>——同是被壓迫者——</p>
<p>我可以聲明現在我們全國直接間接效忠抗戰的軍民、都知道自己爲甚麽戰、爲甚麽死、都知道一切勞力與生命的犧牲、是絕對會必要有理由有代價、代價是什麽、就是藉現代人的犧牲、能以換取萬　人的自由幸福、而這自由幸福是有利益于世界人　、連日本也在其中、這就是說、三民主義　新中國、要從流血犧牲中堅牢的建設起來、這樣　新中國、　能够做世界和平進步的一大往石，同時就可以促日本之革新，使　亞不再有第二次慘劇、我們軍人對于日本官兵在華的種種兇行、自然是萬分痛惡、然所痛惡者、是其行爲、其思想、而並不要仇視其人民因爲×兵都是日本民衆的一分子、而日本民衆是受軍閥欺騙的宣傳、及錯誤的敎育、和强迫的命令、所以責任在日本軍閥而不在日本兵、並旦我們知道、許多日本兵是知識分子、及有職業的良善人民、其中也　有反對侵略主義、而不得已應徵作戰之人、所以我們雖决心殲滅×軍、以求從日本侵略中解放、但從沒有仇視日本民眾、或報復的意思、我在去年、曾經重新訂正優待俘虜條例、對于虜獲的日本軍官士兵衣食住及一切待遇、都和我們作戰的官兵一樣、我們全軍上下、都能眞誠　守、把許多俘虜感化到感激涕零。尤其是我們不取仇視報復的事實……這就是因爲我們全軍、是信仰三民主義的革命軍人、因爲我們旣有抗戰到底的鞏固决心、同時還有比抗戰　衛更遠更大的革命信仰、</p>

<p>今日是『七七』紀念，是我國空前未有的紀念日，我國自有史以來，對外戰爭，以此次抗戰意義爲最重大，而國家民族危機，亦以此次被侵略爲最迫切，我們明　抗戰的意義，我們明瞭目前的危險，便應該知道除了澈底抵抗以外，絕無其他生路可行，諸君讀書，當然了解國家及　約形勢，而且遍覧過中外的歷史，當前的形勢。旣昭示我們，非抵抗不足以　存，而歷史更吿訴我們，非抵抗不足以立國。</p>
<p>不過有些人或者尙顧慮着自己的力量，因之對於國家的前途，有種種的揣測，我以爲輕×固然不可，自棄更與自殺無異二中國抗戰，不覺經已兩年，這不特是　志不定的人們所夢想不到，就是×人也始料不及。如果××人早知道中國能持久抗戰，恐怕未必敢輕於發動，現在×方人力，物力·財力之消耗，早已遠出乎預算之外，他以這樣大部份的力量，用於中國，實　　很大的危險，所以×人今日，實有欲罷不能之嘆，而我們以相　甚遠之物質，亦旣抵抗了兩年，在這兩年當中，雖飽受憂患痛苦，但軍事，政治，經濟都有顯著的進步，能抵抗到兩年，便能抵抗到三年，四年，五年，以至若干年。這是毫無疑義，我國因為物質不如人，而困苦特甚，然而勝利的目的，始終必可達到，須知精神的力量，實駕乎實質力量之上，物質有窮乏之時。精神無滅絕之日，我們應該彭舞起數千年所遺留「成仁取義」的固有精神，來爭取最後的勝利。目前種種困苦，不惟不會令我們灰心，反足以　鍊我們，　　我們，使我們抵抗之志，永久不渝，古人說「師直爲壯曲為老」。我們是被侵略者，爲求國家民族生存而戰，爲防衛全世界被侵略者而戰，理直氣壯，惟有一往直前，絕無徘徊瞻顧之餘地。凶戰危，可止則止。不知此次戰爭，主動在×，而非在我；譬如盜賊入室，同室之人，惟有共起禦之，盜賊不去，則抵禦不止；我國抗戰，祇求不受侵略，×人如果顯然　　，我主　領土，不受　害，則眞正和平，反掌可得；否則求和無異乞降，此中是非利害，辨別至　，不容　　！</p>
<p>基於以上所說，我們惟一的辦法，祇有堅决地抵抗。我們旣然明白不得不戰，不得不戰到底的道理，自然有堅强的意志；我們既然知道最後的勝利必屬於我國，自然有很　實的自信心，人人有了堅強的意志，有了　確實的自信心，便能够發生偉大的力量；中國有最多的人口，有極悠久的歷史和文化，有廣大的土地和物產，這種力量實在是可以發揚到無限。</p>
<p>中國不患沒有力量，而患在力量不能集中：合則厚、分則薄。其理至綫；而且分散的力量，容易消失於無形，有時或　於不知不覺中，用於反對方向，以致互相抵消囚此，第一，我們要各個人以全部的力量，貢獻到國家　須知個人之生存，是靠　國家之生存國民是　求國家之生存而生，也應該爲求國家之生存而死。明乎此則自利的惡根，可由此剷除。我是向來主張革命應先從心琿改造做起，這兩年的敎訓，實足以促進吾人心理之改造，要之，人人指無私心，然後能以個人力量貢獻國家，然後能集中所有的力量，然後能以整個的國家力量，去爭取最後的勝利，第二吾人的力量應該用于同一之目的同一的步驟，故必須有一貫的國策，和統一的領導者，蔣委員長以大公無私的精神，主持抗戰　國大計，是我們唯一的領導者，我們在領袖領導之下，本着旣定的國策，一心一德，努力以赴，終有　雲霧見靑天之一日。</p>
<p>諸　是有爲的靑年，靑年是救國的先鋒，靑年是國家的礎石，靑年不努力，救國的陣綫，便會崩潰，國家的基本，便會傾頽，吾國之不振與國民敎育之不能普及，有很大的關，係諸　旣為今日中國的靑年，便要負起今日中國靑年的責任，你們要養成高尙的道德去，負起　國的責任，你們要獲取高　的　問，去負起救國的責任，你們要鍛　健强的體魄，去負起救國的責任。不特個人如此，還要引導听有的國民，大家都去用負救國的責任。抗戰之勝　，由我而不由人，大家都向戰勝之路進前，便能夠得到勝利，靑年是戰　路上的前導，諸君努力罷！</p>

<p>— 長</p>
<p>原文載『巴黎晚報』</p>
<p>作者勃倫查（C．Blanchard）</p>
<p>北歐的　　，在　　上，處於中立的　位。而不是歐洲的危險區域，但是，這個和平的國家，現在也常常舉行軍事演習，以準備應付戰爭的降臨，上次的世界大戰，幾乎有關　個歐洲大陸，但瑞典終能保持中立，未予參加但今後的瑞典，終將不免　入戰禍嗎？</p>
<p>不大熟悉近年來瑞典政治情形的人們，祇記得瑞黃在歐　時的中立。認爲這是一種對德的友好行動，而現在的瑞典也仍保持　德的好感，可是，事實上，今昔情况，已大不相同，瑞典的輿論已起了很大的變動，而推動這種變動的主要人物却是舉世聞名的希特勒，納粹的統治，威脅瑞典的自由與進步，因而，瑞典人民都感覺震駭了。</p>
<p>不久以　，希特　　將軍　　　在瑞典京城濱說，鼓　納粹主義，並且鄭重的指出璣典是地廣人少的離家。足能再　　　百萬人民，這　演詞之眞　所在，是不　明瞭的，瑞典已有各種納粹組織，而瑞典人民也已開始抗拒希特勒主義的侵人，由於種族，敎育和文化等關係。瑞典對德國。實有天然的好感，所以，瑞典人民的痛惡納粹主義，並不就是不喜歡德國，可是，時日久長以後，反對納粹主義與反德是並無若何分別了。</p>
<p>斯坎的　　亞　細的電　　　。是　發達的，在許多電影中。我們可以看出北歐反德的象徵，但，這不是說。瑞典將　意於維持其中立地位，雖然被持入世界大戰的危險，是極為可能的，而且，瑞典北部有非常豐富的　礦，品質優良，對於製造戰爭用品，尤爲　宜，如果，世界大戰一旦爆發，德國必定需要瑞典的　　，以製造軍械，而英法亦必設法阻止瑞典　　　往德國，在這種情形之下，瑞典能否仍舊維持中立，　是很嚴重的問題了。</p>
<p>坎的　擊　跑　飽　勢，非常　要，對於德蘇兩國的關係，尤為重大，蘇聯在化冰洋摩瑪斯克築有偉大海軍　　地，但這不是想進攻挪威或瑞奐，其眞實目的乃在控制挪威西岸的若干天然港口，俾於　時能制止德　艇隊擾　海上交通的活動，所以，準備應付大　的國家，對於斯坎的那維亞的重要，是不能加以忽視</p>
<p>瑞典的北部，有許多『　山』，不但　　豐富，而目　地優良，　是軍工　　　不可少的羅　，瓖典每年　出　畸七八百　　，其中的大部分，是運往　國，如果德國　够控紛瑞典的　聲，　對其侵略企圖的發展，是更有裨益了。</p>
<p>德國目前在波羅的海方面的優勢，似已不能加以否認；近來，　　和</p>
<p>商定在亞蘭羣島設防，瑞典艦隊並巡邏波　的海，這實是一種勇聆的行為，但是，恐未能產生多大效果，由地勢上言，　　艦隊是極易被襲　的。</p>
<p>很可能的，德國不僅抆控制立陶宛轉　　　　，並且，還要獨霧丹麥，使瑞典載運鐵礦赴德的海上路綫，好　　德國的領海一樣，同時，對於波羅的海的進口處，也更易加以控制了。</p>
<p>很明顯的，我們可以看到，控制斯坎的　維亞的企圖，對於德國，　是極端重要的，納粹的德國，在希特勒的統治下。對於這些情形。比誰都知道得，濟楚，也許在不久的將來，北歐將發生變動。誰又能預料呢？</p>

<p>亡命客的元羣</p>
<p>在上海，一條悠長的電飛路，誰都知道是法租界最繁華的區域，號稱爲「小巴黎」的。但實際上你去看看，那可眞不是「巴黎」，却是「聖彼得堡」，在那條街上，法國的物事，真是少之又少；但俄國的玩意，却應有盡有，枚不勝舉。俄國的雜貨店，俄國的珠寳商，俄國的藥房，俄國的公寓，俄國的菜館，俄國的酒吧　，俄國的劇院，俄國的舞場，俄國的妓院，……還有俄國的男人，俄國的女人——自然都是白俄，而不是赤俄。</p>
<p>全世界除除哈爾濱之外，上海該算得上是白俄的第二故鄉了：他們憧憬着法相界便是他們的「聖彼得堡」——他們是决不承認有「列寧格勒一這個名字的。</p>
<p>白俄在上海的人數，的確不少，而且還川流不息　的源源而來。但他們眞正數目，也可沒法知道：因爲他們來也無　，去也無　，沒有個登記的回事。誰能去統計呢，　　在亡命客之中。白俄的確算得上是「元老」了；命途的孤苦伶仃，確不是他人趕得上的，就像現在自　國被逐出來的猶太人吧，還有英美的憐惜，大發慈悲的救濟：但當白俄失去了他們沙皇的時候，却無人過問，出亡在外。東去碰壁。西走擋駕，於是乎，乃流到了這國際的都市——上海。在這個自由的地方，中國人沒法管，外國人不願管，於是乎，便成了沒有國籍的亡命客的集中營了，白俄便是這營中的主要份子。</p>

<p>「……人才真够多—在隨便那一個晚上，你祇須稍爲選拔幾個，就可以將俄羅斯帝國的陸軍參謀部改組過。這里有的是公爵，親王，大將，上校，同樣，你要在這里組織一個莫斯科歌舞團，也是一件極便當的事，唱高昔的，唱低音的，奏絃樂的。吹管樂的，祗要你叫得出名字　這里决不會沒有，而且你就是選去了一批之後，候補的人才還濟濟得很呢！」</p>
<p>的確，這話不是太誇張，但不幸的，命運叫他們大不如意，現在他們是全無用武之地了，今日上梅，白俄一般的職業，開個小店，做個洋行職員，自，也有，但是微乎其微的啦—最普遍而會灸人口的，男的便是當法租界巡捕房的巡捕，或私家的保銀。等而下之，　着西伯利亞的毛毯，或拉若替人拭點去衣樣上的油漬的朋友，甚而至於流浪在街頭上，酒店前。說兩句洋涇濱的羅宋　三。女的，似乎更悽慘了，待女，舞女，妓女，已成了獨佔的事業。自歐美來的人，不問是外交官，是洋丘八，常常都會拜倒在　們石榴裙上，替她們開銷生活費，</p>
<p>但，有許多白俄，雖然貧窮。倒也還志氣頗高似的，覺得這「羅宋」的名字，有點丢臉：於是乎，他雖然設的滿口「達達　的俄國話，却偏不承認他　俄國人，有的說是羅馬尼亞，有的說是坷爾巴尼亞。有的說是……反正是一個角落里的小國家：决不是俄國人，他得一口咬定的。</p>
<p>白俄的處境雖然是這樣的狼狽，但二十年前的一場繁華夢，他們的永遠忘不了的。「復國」的希望雖然早已終絕了、但他們仍然憧憬　，夢想着，終有那麽一天，他們還要重新創造世界，再寫下一篇歷史來，</p>
<p>在上海，他們之開，有一個所　『　民憤會』的，算是他們的組織，會務的最大目的，又是一個憧憬：「打囘　家去」，一切的行動，　受在「滿洲國」　白俄頭目西米諾夫指揮、而西米　失的後台、　　堂掌的日本關東軍。</p>
<p>不久以前，這「復國」的好戲，慢慢地演出來了。在日本的領導之下。西米諾夫想在西似利亞來一個稱「王」自大，但給「張鼓峯」的一捧打醒了，接着却　到了上海，在東京的口口聲聲「反共」的口號之下，上海的三四百個白俄在去年冬天的某一天，在虹口的禮査飯店開起會來，也　着要加入「反共」，並且，還誓爲「反共」的先軀，天哪！這才眞是「銀彈」作崇呢，自然，羅宋的爺爺將軍們，又多了一門新的行業生財之道了。</p>
<p>最近，天津的封鎖，聽說白俄先生們，又一再的要結隊　進英租界去逛逛。想來，「出路」是愈來愈出了，</p>
<p>『喂：對不住，請你代我打一個電話，行嗎？』</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述</p>
<p>一九一四年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比　，趁德輪去遊　默　，因爲英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。好容易　逃出虎口，回到紐約去。　克斯又叫他們趁一聖瑪克號」去歐洲找他的兒子。在船上，傑克不肯　一個名叫强生的人發封密碼電報，原來　像伙就是叫拉維基的德國奸細。突然船上提到求救無線電……</p>
<p>「叉有什麽消息嗎？」他問馬倫</p>
<p>馬倫　若頭，「沒有，只有起先的電。」</p>
<p>比爾　站在門口，　時，忽然大叫起來。</p>
<p>「看，傑克，那邊是什麽？」他指着天際。</p>
<p>由他手指處看去，在夜色中，天上湧起一陣紅光。升起來時，似乎一座火光熊熊的溶鐵爐，一下子，落下去，只剩了模糊，暗淡的閃光。傑克，許久都不能决定，那倒底是怎麽回事。</p>
<p>「那是一條着火的船，後來，他認明了。」</p>
<p>差不多，在仝一時間，船頭的守望者，大叫着，架樓上的人，也大聲響　着。都在告訴，有這麽一囘事。</p>
<p>傑克他們雖然知道，在海洋上，看見一條着火的船，是算不了什麽的。但是，看着那火光。一會會升高，一會兒降落。心里也禁不住有點難受。</p>
<p>『好嗎，這老傢伙在飛奔啦。』比爾察出『聖瑪克號』已　改了方向，加了速度了。</p>
<p>一個船員，伍德先生，帶領了幾個水手來了。他們忙着解下了一隻小艇，備放下水，另外又有三條小船，預備載救出來的人。</p>
<p>當『聖瑪克號』駛往那條着大的船時，火光更熅旺了，但是，距離還是太遠、着不淸楚，究竟是一條甚麽船。</p>
<p>『我要想法子，跟上一條小船。』傑克向比爾說，他們正看着那些預備放船下水的人們。</p>
<p>『我也要　』比爾同意的。『你想可有機會？』</p>
<p>『我不知道。不過，開船的那夭，我免費替伍德先生發了一封電報，給他那生病的母親　這，或者，對　能留下一點好感。總之，我去問問他。』</p>
<p>傑克胸有成竹的，去找了那個頑固傢伙，說了半天，他囘到比　這邊來，帶着笑。</p>
<p>『成了，』他說着，『要得他的同意。眞是挺不容易。結果，我還是說服了他，我們去。』</p>
<p>『眞好啦！』比爾歡呼着，『現在，要件油布衣，這樣的天氣，它是少不了的。』</p>
<p>『我自己　里有一件，』　克說，「我去　你把馬倫的借來。」</p>
<p>「勞駕，　—看那火，簡直象風軍大爐啦。」</p>

<p>較難奏功、本年計劃乃先决定毛茶之最高最低及平均扯價、限令商人現　收購爲防止壓價壟斷計、茶葉部商同中央貿委會於各茶區、成立毛茶收　處、依規定價格收茶、如商人願出高價競購者、聽其自然、如此農民利益必可提高、前以消極限制、未能見效之問題、均可迎刃而解，</p>
<p>（三）調劑茶業金融一—欲農民改良其生產·茶商改良其造、先使其資金充足，運用自如、此當戰時、金融週轉較難、農商自籌、不無問題、茶葉部特向貿委會商借茶貸資金、低利貸放、本年預計、當在三百萬以上、茶用材料方面、爲免除商人採辦困難及成本過高、亦擬以法定匯價、大批購入、作爲實物　放、</p>

<p>（五）調整倉運組織——戰時倉運爲當前茶業之重大問題、積極方面爲求速運、　運、多運及倉　之安全、消極方面　取締走私偷漏、特於各重要地點、設立茶葉倉運站、並登記茶葉倉運業、以便統籌管理、</p>
<p>（六）發展研究訓練—茶業改造各方面、有待研究者殊多、茶葉部就力之所及、均當次第進行，然茶政之進行、端　人材、故於健全幹部人材之訓練造就、尤當注意、蓋是項人材、不但須具有茶葉產　技術之充份學力、且於整個茶業政策、需有充份之認識、並能爲公忘我、堅苦奮鬥、如此、則中國茶葉之改造、庶幾有望、</p>

<p>被印刷出來的紙張。發散到營裏，連裏，排裏，班裏，以至農民們的旱烟袋裏都有了。他們相信，被印刷出來的紙張，是子彈，是可以結果×人的生命的子彈！</p>
<p>過去：這些現象是未曾有過的，數千年來的女化史上，將寫下這光明燦爛的一帙。我們可以說：終結着舊的，是我們這一代，而開創着新的，也是我們這一代。因此，責任的重大將促使我們更奮發，更刻苦。</p>
<p>在文化的前哨線上，我們的文學工作者，是懂得完成歷史任務的具體路線的。我們的抗日戰爭，從第一階段——初步的，走上第二階段——高級的：而我們文學和所有發展的運動一樣，也有着向　高發展的本性。由更高階段的發展，而跳到更高的實踐，乃成爲文學在抗戰的中最高目的。</p>
<p>我們知道，中國的文化是一塊豐沃的上地，幾千年的進化的過程中，她也曾開放過黃金一樣的花朶。但是，當我們漫步在那廣闊的文化土地上時，我們將發現眞正屬於大衆的而被保留下來的產物是很少很少。</p>
<p>尤其是那些偉大的鬥爭——例如「太平天國」等，當時的文學，這一種反動的語法曲解寫出來的場面，她代表那班昏庸的統治階層在揑造着種種不合理的故事，當時的農民們爲什麽要鬥爭？爲什麽要忍若饑餓衝出了他們的田園？這些，當時的作者們終於把他們寫成一種「猙獰」與「蠻性」麽。其實，真正「猙獰」「蠻性」的現實，却被忍略了。</p>
<p>今日，學術中國化的提出，給我們的文華開拓了一條更寬闊的大道。</p>
<p>近數百年來，中國文化興國際文化相比較，那種距離，是多麽可怕？這並不是說中國文化的沒有特點而不能急趨直上，主要的那些特點，給社會經濟發展的階段所限制着，因之，她跟中國的社會一樣地貧弱，萎靡。然而，那些特點仍是客觀地存在着的。</p>
<p>我國的維新運動開始以來，以至辛亥革命，以至「五四」我們的國家裏的兩個極端是愈形尖銳，這兩個極端卽是：一方面盡量地歐化一方面是盡量地維護「國本」。前者認為中國的落後是在於沒有和外國的一切相同。後者前唾棄着「洋書」，認爲祇有復古才能興邦。竟然有人叫靑年閉們讀經，以挽救國家厄運。</p>
<p>事實上，要把中國弄成和外國一模一樣的國家，是一種空想。而要把發展着的某一個歷史階段送囘到從前那些歷史階段去，也是根本做不到的。</p>
<p>根據這些情形，我們承認我們對於自己的國家的優秀的歷史傳統，還不够理解。年青的文學工作者疏忽了我們自己的國家要的文學寶藏。——正因爲我們很少去想到那些，我們只管在外國文學的書廚中搬出些東西來。或是只管在標點一點線裝出。我們對於提汲，消化改進像這種的工作，可以說還沒有做得　我們的胃對付食物那樣地做的好。</p>
<p>誠如本文的前段所寫及的，那些熱情的內心的叫喚。固然需要，但是事實上，要使這種叫喚永遠這樣成爲一種停滯的狀態，是不可能的。我們將通過理性的認識，再育養出人們的新的感情來！</p>
<p>因此，我們要求　文學工作者必須學習理論，提高文化水準（這是跟「大衆化」不衝突的）並且吸收世界文化的新思想，跟　這個要求，我們批判過去的中國文學，硏究中國的歷史傳統，提汲那些精華，乃是必要的了，創造中國化的新文學，不僅祇於如此。我們還要提取華術的精華，以充實自己，——這種提取務必使它跟中國文學的精華融化爲一。</p>
<p>生硬的歐化。完全是沒有消化的原故。</p>
<p>學術中國化是使學術適合於中國目前現階段的需要，是學術成爲中國整個文化的有機部分，是使中國的學術成爲世界學術的積極的一部分。我們的文學，學術的一個部分，我們應該起來　應這個號召——這完全是客觀上的需要。</p>
<p>為了使文學作品更普及，更在大衆之間起着積極地作用，我們的文學工作者，一方面要熟悉唯物辯證法，幷遝用它來理解與批判中國的歷史與文化……一方面，要把握住現實。針對着現實，來寫出人們所需要的和「促進」人們的作品的。我們知道這些都是爲着未來，——示來的新中國的文學　地，是　須在今日的我們的血與汗中墾　起來。</p>
<p>我曾經看過我們的戰士在他的臂上　着「活捉土　原」的字樣，也有在笠　上自己寫著那些决心犧牲的字　。這些現象，都充分地指示出，我們是在爲我們全民族以及全世界的人類的生存而作戰！</p>
<p>至此，我們更需進一步的理解文學右抗戰中　最高目的是什麽。</p>

<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>造完了毒孽的飛機，已經飛開去了，這時那個靑年人也爬過來，吿訴她們停在外　那幾節貨車站是他們的目標，可是沒有炸中。』</p>
<p>解除警報的聲音響了，他們都爬起來。遠近都有哭號的聲音，　的沉然地躺下去，或是把血肉分飛到四方去，活着的人哀傷地哭着。</p>
<p>『走，我們可以到水池去洗洗臉。』</p>
<p>她們聽他的話，找到一個淸澄的水邊，蹲下去，都把臉上的血汚和泥土洗掉，然後向着站台走去。</p>
<p>救護車和防車都飛駛過來了，担架床上尋着受傷的人，還有一只大竹筐，收拾地上零碎的骨肉，一陣陣血腥的氣味，撲進了鼻腔。</p>
<p>「我們算是第二次做人！」</p>
<p>倉房被炸燬了一半，火還在燒着，路基陷了一口大坑，鐵軌跳到幾丈以外，　兩　有發亮皮紋的蛇偃伏在那裏。</p>
<p>『你看，那邊的車就是我們　坐過來的』。</p>
<p>那個靑年人指點着，那列車已經倒下去，有幾節只乘下筋骨。</p>
<p>「唉呀，我的小箱子還在上面呢！」</p>
<p>靜　忽然叫了一聲，靑芷只淡淡地說：</p>
<p>『那算得了什麽，你看那些！』</p>
<p>担架床上傷者的行列，從大火的近前走過去，血從床　滴到地上，有的已經不能呻吟，和死去的人差不多。在一顆小樹的下面，看到炸去兩條腿的一個人。他的臉紙樣白，還在轉動他身子；可是担架床的人看看他就過去了，問起來很平淡地說：『他一定要死的，用不到抬到醫院去。』</p>
<p>青芷的心裏打了一個冷戰，她想如果　個人是她可該怎么辦呢？她不知道那個人是不是還有疼痛的感覺，也不知道他是不是還能聽見別人　話？</p>
<p>夜沉下來了，　一點也不覺得餓，走開了車站一些時，仿佛還聞見屍　的氣味。那個青年人好心地陪着她們，問她們到什么地方去。一時間她們也說不出來。電刀　沒有　電，全　都是　　　。</p>
<p>遠遠的，忽然傳來歌唱的聲音，漸漸地洪亮起來，一片火光　街角轉過來。乍看見光亮好像有一點不習慣似的，過些時纔看見那是五六個人一　地執着火把的行列在前進着，他們唱着，叫着，走先的是一個騎馬的軍人，他們好像一點也不　懼，幷不像經過一場屠殺似的，他們的步伐很堅定，　躍的火焰，烘照出二張張通紅的臉，兩隻黑黑的眼睛，筆直地射出剌人的光輝。他們有年靑的男人，也有女人，有工人，也有商人，就是　動着白鬍子的老年人也不是沒有的。他們一齊張大嘴唱着；喊着，　整個的城市在他們的聲昔之中震顫，　大地在他們的步伐下抖動。　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c55">讀「陳二石頭」 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>文藝戰線二三號連載</p>
<p>『……他坐在陳二石頭旁邊。看看陳二石頭，陳二石頭沒理他。他又看看陳二石頭，陳二石頭還是沒有理他，停了一會兒，他又看看陳二石頭，噫！唉！這有什麽好看吶……叉停了一會兒，他又看看陳二石頭這叫奇怪嘞……』</p>
<p>一連四個看看，眞是寫得傳神極了，假如簡括的換寫一句『一連看了他幾下，』便不如得多。</p>
<p>作者的成功在於描寫得細膩有勁，講演起來可以頭頭是這。不致於使聽衆發悶而感到這是：</p>
<p>「說謊的騙子！」</p>
<p>但在結　方面我却以爲太散漫了。散漫固是說故事的通病，而且胡扯亂道的也不在小數，可是旣稱爲「文學」自然就得還出一些文學面目來。至少也要揚棄舊形式中的不良的成份，方可算是『利用』，陳二石頭的作者着眼於『講演』範圍的廣博，而忘却此點，實在很可情。尤其在文藝戰線第三期續文中硬揷入一個開小差的軍官『王德銘』，一『拉』就『拉』了一萬多字的『瓜兒』，佔了全文一半篇幅，作者頻頻用這些字眼來想浮彫出這個人物：</p>
<p>『……你看那樣子也够害怕的啦，兩個眼睛直挺挺的，臉都發靑。……』</p>
<p>『外頭　劈拍拍的打槍嘞……王德銘兩手抱件個二石頭的腰，他可眞的喝壞嘞。』</p>
<p>『陳二石頭看着王德銘那副可憐樣兒……』。</p>
<p>總之王德銘是被當作一個懦怯。可憐而叉狡猾勢利的下流軍人而描寫着的，這一類人的抉發對於黑　面的把握很不錯，但末了我想，作者將怎樣處置他呢？揚棄了嗎？還是感化了呢？可是一樣也　猜到，作者　完陳二石頭到當了游擊隊，把他一欄就　　無形無縱，甚至使我不明白作者費了這麽大勁來寫這位人物的本意，若說藉此加强陳二石頭的個性，那或　會得到相反的効果。如說這是在寫『逃難　門』的典型代表者，那寫什麽沒有一個下文呢？故事說　中最重要的是『又代淸　』，所謂「欲知後事如何，且聽下回分解」便是，講演文學雖不必什麽『話說』『却說』，但頭腦簡單的人對于『因果』道那最爲看重，有頭沒有尾的　事是難難滿足他們的因　觀念的，結果王德銘在群衆槪念中必然會　大到一般不良的現象。</p>
<p>陳二石頭個人寫得還不錯，活像是道地的徐州府莊稼人，有極的小鏡頭也揷得很妥當，祇是他轉變到當游擊隊時，作者用『忽然』兩個字來馬虎過；倒眞太ｅ　些『忽然』了，除了這幾點外，『陳二石頭』總算是一篇優秀的大眾文藝，一篇大體得到了成功的嘗試作品——我很高興的說，它是替我們奠定一種利用舊形式的新的路徑了。　（完）</p>
<h3 id="c56">無言之痛 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 李留年</p>
<p>偶而閒着，就去找一個朋友談談，因爲同是年靑的文藝愛好者，所以在相見之下，所謂的總脫不了文　，接着便針對目前孤島上的慘淡的景象發了一通妄論。坐了一會，我也在他的書架上取下一本魯彥的「旅人的心」之後，就　出了。取　本書的動機，無非我也是一個旅人吧，我正要看看所謂「旅人」的心是怎樣的，彼此是否有着同一的情感給貫穿着心境。</p>
<p>囘家。我翻着『旅人的心』，在這上面却發現了朋友的讀後感，是八行的詩；術　用着「無言之痛」四字：</p>
<p>白紙上畫有小小的圈，</p>
<p>你能遁出對故鄉的思念嗎？</p>
<p>旅人的心呀！</p>
<p>跌在痛苦的小圈　了，</p>
<p>企望一切慰藉來臨，</p>
<p>你　頭守候，</p>
<p>苦塞的旅人的心。</p>
<p>但求放大　生命的光　！</p>
<p>我的朋友將他自身的懷鄉症流露在這八行中間無法掩飾了。</p>
<p>但是故鄕呢？</p>
<p>在炮火的下面，故鄕——他的和我　，除僅仔一類似亂石崗式的地坪而外，就祇有碎瓦　磚的刦餘。想着了這，懷鄉的症狀，自然是意加沉重，有時不很不寄一些無言的痛苦在字行中間，聊以舒懷，然而沉痛這是依然。</p>
<p>其實，他是缺乏了堅定的「信念」的，否則決不會　無言之痛滋長在心裏，　傷了他：要是這樣發展下去，他是會沉沒在最嚴重的精神　裏，永遠不能自拔；直　的說來，他正在從事於慢性的自殺呢，</p>
<p>「最後勝利是屬於我們的！」我們　棄這無言之痛作這無言的希望和努力，才能故大那生命的光圈；不是？蔣總裁昭吿着我們：「一人之生命有限，民族之生命窮！」我們還要放大更大的光圈呢。</p>

<p>「國難，兩年了！」每個人的心頭。都浮盪着這個深刻的記憶！</p>
<p>靑年記者學會主辦的中國新聞學院的員生，心情上也給這個記憶激起了波蘭朋友們正視着困難，要在今天。來一個莊重表示，並且，要在今天，刻下一個承接艱舌工作的記念標記，——同學會的成立體，特定在這時舉行，</p>
<p>當海上的晚風飄搖上山來的時候，堅道途中形色忽怱的，掛着車輪襟章的學生，二個，三個；向着新聞學院灌穿者。</p>
<p>七時十三分，歌聲，和一片片的碎語收斂了，同學們為着院長，敎務長，以及來賓先生們，踱進一個光明的禮堂各人圍坐着一仰半圓的，雅潔的座位，這個意味濃厚的紀念會就開始了、</p>
<p>最初，先來一個「揷曲」：七七節食献金，就在這時舉行了，一個風度雯雅的同事，手捧一個小盒于，邁避于各人的面前，如是，鑼角子，銀幣、銅幣，三毛，五毛，一境香港紙，還有廣東毫幣，都紛紛投向那盒子去，這，好像將士們將子彈向×人齊放一般。</p>
<p>隨着，主席打着沉重的調子。「今夜我們同時舉行兩個會，一個是七七記念會，一個是中國新聞學院同學會成立會意思是；在抗戰成長中，我們要以戰鬥的姿勢，在新聞陣綫上，迎接新的工作……」</p>
<p>司儀的朋友緊跟着主席塲下口，用着短促的聲音喊着「訓話」後卽代替主席的職務，去請來賓黃祖芬先生登台　話、</p>
<p>黄先生將一番珍貴的工作經驗，作為一種禮品，供送給在坐的學生，最後，他特別提出「……在同學會中，該以工作為重！」</p>
<p>跟着，主席走到向那慈祥的老人前面，（該院的院長郭步陶先生）恭敬地請他豋台訓話，這時，所有的視線都到那邊去，同是鼓響了手掌。</p>
<p>老人襲着輕綺的長衫離了坐位，全場又况入了肅穆，許多人希望得到的話句，終于由他的口中播出了，（一）同學會，工作應該掃除「派別」的壞觀念，（二）選擇新聞戰綫上的新目標，（三）抗戰中的新聞從業員，應該在苦難中完成自己的工作，（四）希望大家能做到，（手，腦，眼，）一齊並用。</p>
<p>從一個浸凉的角落裏，請上了羅吟圃先生，他以輕鬆調子給學生們一個明快的警惕：「新聞記者的影響很大…雖然他可以出賣精神和時間，但不能將正確的主張賣掉……新聞從業員要是不想法子從各方面去取得知識，從事敎靑自己，那，只有「墮落」是他唯一的前途。</p>
<p>聽的人，好像食着一種珍奇的海鮮，滿嘴體昧着香甜，但微微的莘椒又剌載着口胃，窗外的晚風吹來，會場中的空氣卽刻新蹤了幾分。</p>
<p>敎務長譚思文先生——是新聞學院天天見面的「保母」一開口便剖掉了客氣的套子和平口一樣，從該處吐露出老實話，這話，好像一杯白糖水，是助消化的，餐後喝了，可以消痰化氣，</p>
<p>大家的情趣和輿奮交匯着，大家忘記時間已捱近了深夜。</p>
<p>學生們很天真的，接二連三的跨着輕敏寬大的步子，到講台上去，抒發自己的感情，從他們的樸素結實的語句裏，知道他們在新聞陣綫上，展開了新工作的念頭了，——</p>
<p>在會中，聽過眞誠的師長和學的話，看過那歡快結彩的情形，總會使你相信，這一支未出爐的新軍將來在新聞陣綫上，會呈現出一番新的姿態啊。</p>

<p>— 白蟬</p>
<p>中救，中藝和各靑年劇社紛紛演出</p>
<p>戲劇工作者是永遠是站在文化崗位上最前線的一員：在這偉大的抗戰廷國二周年底來臨中，他們更以最熱烈的繼續和鬥爭的精驗去迎接這神聖的節日！</p>
<p>最近香港的劇運在白熱化的情况下發展得很蓬勃，「中救」「冲簇」「中藝」幾領大劇團固然不斷的演出，而小劇團同樣也溍伏地工作着，實在，通俗大衆劇運有其自我生長與發展，廣泛而深入的爲斷大羣集所愛好和需要的，在「七七」二週年這當中，無縱地更成了他們重要的工作課題，本來，「香港靑年節劇協會」應當在統一的號，演　　　　　出，但由于最近客觀規矩的變更新和物質條件同樣限度了這件較戰大的工作，因此，各社社祇有用散兵綫的作戰方式去作個別的爭取更有利的工作機會。</p>
<p>在這數天來，不論在那佃角落，場合，都會有着我們靑年戲劇伙伴們熱烈興奮而沉毅線工作若，角個人都貢獻了最大的熱力和精神去紀念這偉大的日子。</p>
<p>據我們能力上可以知道的有以下的演出：</p>
<p>「中救」鍛後的臨別獻演從六日於重慶演出英勇雄壯的抗戰史劇「魯南之光」為紀念抗戰建國二週年的偉大節日，于「七七」舉行日夜兩場演出以盧溝橋歷史的重現的劇作「無定河邊」，並以全部收入作献金運動的義演。在八日則仍演「習南之光」。一連三天，都是以最低廉的券價，招待全港的學生和民衆，作爲留別的紀念。演出的精湛偉大，觀衆情緒的熱烈和緊張，和上幾次演出同樣地得到極美滿的收獲。</p>
<p>中藝在「七七」的上午九時半假中央戲院演出曙光」，這是靑年記着學會香港分會，中國文藝協會聯合中藝舉行紀念「七七」二週年而演出的。</p>
<p>南華體育會的戲劇組假孔聖堂演出「祖國進行曲」，這是包括了三個有相連性的獨幕劇的戲；由鄧鐘秀導演。</p>
<p>靑年同樂社是九龍很有聲譽的靑年救亡團體，自七月五日至七日每晩分婦女兒童聯合三組舉行七七紀念，演出「鐵蹄下的女性」，「帮子戲」，「順民」等獨幕劇。</p>
<p>港九婦女敎育服務團是九龍深水埔的進步智識婦女及各工廠女工友所組織，在六日和七日兩晚聯合僑光社及學德勵志社舉行七七擴大紀念會，演出「鐵蹄下的女性」，「別的苦女人」，「榮譽大隊」等戲戲。</p>
<p>自強體育社會紅鐵區一個很努力的工友社區七日應紅磚各界紀念七七二週年紀念會的邀請，演出一血洒蘆溝橋」及「最後一計」。</p>
<p>九龍廠工友組織的新星社對戲劇運動極爲努力。昨晚亦舉行七七紀念，演出「最後一計」及「張家店」，由凌司胡瑞華等負責導演。</p>
<p>紅紅歌詠隊是廣州大學附中學生的一個新組織，現同時成立一戲劇隊。由七日起一連四天到荃創作鄉村流勒宣傳，除歌詠演講外，並演出「三江好」，「淪亡以後」等</p>
<p>旋風劇社是深水埔一個工友的業餘劇團，七日晨應港九難民免費學校的邀請假北河戲院上演「歸不得故鄉」，並有知用小學校友會的「省一粒子彈」，及煥南學校的讀書救國」一同演出。</p>
<p>惠陽靑年會曾於五日晚服該會自謂荔一角游泳場舉行月夜歡叙會，到有會友等四百餘人，情緒熱烈非常，七日晚更舉行七七紀念會，演出「張家店等劇」，並有歌泳演講專。</p>
<p>除了能力七所述知悉的之外，自然還有更多的伙伴們在不爲人注意中緊張而熱烈的工作着，我相信，這種槪略的報導已使人相當驚異感覺，想不到年靑的戲勒工作者是這樣沉着而苦幹地用行動去紀念這偉大的日子呵、</p>
<p>從抗戰開始後，×××戲劇工者以富于運動性和鬥爭件的態度站在××文化崗位上，做了最優秀的戰鬥員，在這抗戰建國二週年的當中，更使人感到他們力量是浩大而不朽的。</p>
<p>願我們的戲劇工作以更强健更堅靱的鬥爭去迎接抗戰建國三週年的開始吧！</p>
<h3 id="c80">光榮的啓示底一頁！ <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 朱白水</p>
<p>舊的仇恨如今要淸償了！</p>
<p>從香港渡海回到家裏來。已是更深闌靜了，父親手種的芭蕉樹很勃發的生長着的芭蕉在月色下搖曳着，我疲憊而思潮湧現的漫步于庭階，夜風吹動了亂髮。</p>
<p>我感到無限的慨感，也無限的亢奮，偉大的民族自衛戰爭的開端，歷史的重演，用悲憤和怒吼的情緒所構堆成「無定河邊」，這史劇團如打結在打經之後「中救」的演出，却給我忘不掉的啊！「無定河邊」（保衛蘆溝橋）這三幕集體創作的史劇，竟然在抗戰建國二週年的今夕能够痛快而竭流的在這個地方上演出，雖然這演出已經是×××××××××但越覺是經過艱苦而不屈的爭取××××××，則越令人無限慨感，也無限興奮！</p>
<p>戲的演出固然是値得我們致很大大的贊佩，去爭取一個有民族獨立性。應有的自由底不屈行動，不畏縮的精神。「中救」是給了我們百萬僑港的中華兒女一個崇高民族性底表現！</p>
<p>我們工作在戲劇崗位上更常常遭遇到無數的不幸的意外的歷程，那時我們是如何的懊喪。如何的借與痛苦，更遙遠地想起鬥爭在黑暗的「孤島」上的伙件們底莫大困難的遭受，有時眞不禁爲我們底民族的自由而但淚！但我知道爲了爭取民挨的翻身，永遠的自由，未來的祖國底新生，我們忍受了一切，我們沉點地工作！</p>
<p>因此，「中救」的能在數度困苦中而不屈不撓，不長不縮的爭取自由的××××××××上是有着如何令人永誌不忘呵！</p>
<p>他更深切的引我想到一個深遠的念頭：使我更堅信祖國的民族自衛爭取雖然是一條狂風駭浪的江河，但祗要我們用更大的忍耐和更大的奮鬥，我們是會跨到勝利的彼岸？</p>
<p>「中救」在抗戰建國二週年的今夕，爲我們劇運寫下了一頁染有光榮的啓示的底一頁！</p>
<p>前年，偉大的戰底喜炮遙遠地從蘆溝橋上傳到南方的革命底古域，把整個古城都搖翻在興奮，悲痛而狂烈的情緒中。</p>
<p>在八月中句，我們以瘋狂的熱情讀完一本永遠在中國劇壇上留下劃時代的紀錄的「保衛蘆溝僑」了｛立刻地全廣州的戲劇工作者，包括了年老的和年靑的伙伴們在「廣東戲劇協會」的號召下而開始排練了。</p>
<p>永遠忘不了的吧，在有着樹蔭和地草的女靑年會，開始我們首次的機會，百餘位的年靑男女伙伴歡快地在那個小小的禮堂把角式分配了，開始着分組的對詞，以後，大家分組好在不同的地方排練了，每個伙伴們是那樣熱情興而興奮的工作，大家都希望一次偉大的演出呵！</p>
<p>八月廿三日，必了太陽牌的鐵烏開始在南方的古城底墟頭了。我們的髙射炮手也開始了首次改革英勇的射擊！鐵戰稱知而碩酷的，可憐地掉在我們的土地。然而，從那個早晨起，這個古城永無休止承受到×××××××××人們完全陷于一種惶恐奔走的不安寧的日子中。可憐生活就是爲了珍惜生命似的到處亡命一我們是靑年的人，我們是這都市活動的心臟，我們沒有怕。沒有畏懼，我們歡笑和卉躍的在空襲中來往，每分組的戲仍舊排練着。</p>
<p>那時早已開始燈火管制了，我們從劇場帶着疲倦而興奮的心情，踏着沒有街燈的道路，髙歡地談笑，有時看見了無知的巿民從門縫開出一點海火光來時，我們從嬉戲的態度用阻老的聲去僞作警察高聲喝呀，有時還用皮靴向破舊的木門重重地碰去，裏面悄悄地才滅光了。</p>
<p>這樣，我們遂有了個矯傲縱情而充滿愉快的歡笑。</p>
<p>可是，古城漸漸空了，人民疏散到自己的家鄕去，留在城巿的我們開始感到工作無對家，並且實在也無法繼續我們的工作，這份頻發的警報使人望空噓嘆。</p>
<p>經過廿多天的興奮的工作，我們被迫而停止了，我們嘆惜，但更惡憤，這個戰沒辦法在這城市裏演出，而這城市却踐踏在胡騎之下了！</p>
<p>而今，兩週年了，記憶重温在心頭，深深地感到無限的張惆，無限的悽愴；可是，中救底演出却給我一個莫大的興奮和歡慰，並完全洗滌了我所有的懦弱情緒一我相信也會洗滌了許多人同樣的情緒。</p>
<p>記得那時，我曾這樣約守過一篇文章，「憤怒地記着吧，誰使我們失掉了上演的自由？……」</p>
<p>但，如今，我們却用新的鬥爭去淸償我們的舊恨了！</p>
<p>七七二週年夜深</p>
<h3 id="c81">「花濺淚」的粵語演出 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 汪鞏</p>
<p>—一個相　美滿的新嘗試—</p>
<p>憑着我外江人固執本的性，自從一年前流亡到香港以來，對于以粤語演出的話劇始終沒有多大的好感，當然一半的原因是爲了聽不懂話的緣故，而且也因爲以前在其他的地方根本就沒有發現用着當地的方言演出話劇過，所以更覺得不入耳了。</p>
<p>其實廣東因爲語言的特殊性，長久以來就存在粤語戲劇，這是一個必然的趨勢，因爲戲劇最大的要求實際上是爭取大量的觀衆。不通應該注意的絕不是去迎合觀衆和將就觀衆的低級趣味，而是慢慢設法提髙他們的興趣，引他們走到一條高度的欣賞水準的路，戲劇的本身絕對不是單練的娛樂，而含着深長的敎育意義的。</p>
<p>所以現在的問題已經不是演出的方言問題，而完全是根某于一種意識，態度和演出的形式問題，假如它是歪曲了目前的現實，逃避了時代的潮流，卽使它有着高度的成熟技巧，還是無可挽救的要趨于沒落和消滅的。</p>
<p>當『中藝」成立粤語組的時候，我當時實在存在着一種碍憂；也許是因爲由于大部份的粤語電影給人深切的惡感，而當時可組淺知道粤語組的團員都是在從事電彩的人物。可是接着就慢慢納改變了觀感，明白一粤語組」的同志也都是深惡痛絕于「民間故事」和「木魚書」，而且有幾位以前在電影界已經有着深長的歷史的藝人，不願意混跡在昏迷的環裏，而毅然，退出面影圈的；這次爲了對于戲劇的愛好，爲了希望得到確正的藝術修養，于是集合在「中藝」的旗幟下。努力的，刻苦的歷練着。</p>
<p>事實上我們是不能將過去的錯誤來抺殺現在的努力和改正的，假如我們能够用事實上的工作精神和演出的效果給那些沉迷在混水裏的「藝人」們一個嚴重的刺激和打擊，而動搖他們惡濁的槪念、那末我以爲這樣的工作雖然艱難，可是它的功績是有看頗大的意義的：我們現在針着的是對事實，不是用了空洞的吶喊就可以完成澄清工者作的使命的，是一個切實的問題，而在中藝組成了以彭人爲單位的專語組以後，更値得嚴重地來討論的；</p>
<p>不過胡春冰先生的意見也是值得大家深切地記取的關于彭人演詁劇的問題。他提供了許多賓貴的意見而在我有並同感的，那主要的就是濱出庸俗化的危險性，和明星制度的惡習，關于這兩個問題，在商業的社會裏是非常容易發生的，或者甚至會不自覺的走上了這條危險的路上去，記得在「八一三一以後的上海。曾經有過一個「影人劇團」的組織，出發到後方的都市，這也是一個職業的劇團組織，關於詳細的情形我雖然並不十分明白。可是無疑地他們是陷入了上面的危機，最後終于還是不幸地瓦解了，這是給每一個從事戲劇工作者的敎訓，要明白營業不過祇是暫時的，而藝術的精神是永的</p>
<p>在「花濺淚」戲演的晚上，我可以說是一個最興奮也最關切的親衆，因爲我是看它在夢少人的合力工作下慢慢地成長的。我感覺得一種說不出的親熱，而在演出的時候，雖然我只能聽懂大半的話，可是每一個演員都以相當繐練的演技吸引着觀衆，一直到滿意地閉幕。這次是一個初創的新嘗試。但欣慰的是他們已開始向成功之路前奔了。</p>
<p>這在許多人也一定會覺得是一個意外的收獲，一羣影人竟能在嘗試中有了這樣相當的成功，而且這次的演出更有着其重大的意義。因爲這是華南戲劇和電影的媒介。「花濺」的演出不特是演出有良好的牧獲，他更進一步地做了切實的淸毒工作，提醒了那批吃影戲飯的敗類的末路的到來；這是一種很好的新生力量！假如這種力量能嚴正的發揚起來。對華南的影劇界是含有一種新的影響的？</p>

<h3 id="e1">China's War of Resistance and the American Revolutionary War <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shih</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, delivered a speech in New York on "Japan's War of Aggression in China," comparing China's War of Resistance to the American Revolutionary War. His words were insightful and his language was brilliant. We have extracted and translated the main points of his speech and are publishing them here. On one hand, it serves to commemorate the American Revolution, and on the other hand, it encourages the Chinese people who are continuing the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>China's War of Resistance, in my opinion, is a revolutionary war with the same meaning and similar circumstances as the American Revolutionary War. The hardships faced by Washington's army at Valley Forge aroused boundless sympathy and praise from historians. It was the dead of winter, yet the soldiers had no shoes or socks, and they marched barefoot. Wherever they went, the white snow was covered with bright red footprints. Washington reported to Congress that he had only a little more than two thousand remaining troops, and they were all barely clothed, with no strength left to fight. The number of people falling ill from hunger and cold increased day by day. The hospitals were full of wounded and sick soldiers, and the facilities were pitifully inadequate, even lacking straw mats to cover the ground. Many wounded soldiers died on the frozen ground.</p>
<p>At this moment of extreme crisis, Britain proposed peace talks, willing to unconditionally abolish all unequal laws. This was indeed a glorious offer of peace. If the founding fathers of America had accepted this proposal at that time, the bloodshed and sacrifices of the next four years could have been avoided. However, in doing so, they would have forever lost the more glorious independence, and the United States of America would never have appeared in the world.</p>
<p>At that time, the founding fathers of America resolutely rejected these peace conditions and continued the War of Resistance for another four years. During those bloody years of war, the situation of danger and hardship was like enduring a terrible winter at Valley Forge. They suffered countless military setbacks, and the territory lost grew day by day. Internal strife and difficulties often arose, and even cases of treason were endless. The value of paper money plummeted. Washington himself once said, "To buy a cart of food, you need a cart of paper money." In early 1780, one dollar in paper money fell to two cents; by the end of the same year, ten dollars in paper money were only worth one cent. Under these circumstances, it was simply impossible to maintain the soldiers' food and clothing.</p>
<p>But no matter how precarious the situation, Washington and his comrades were determined not to give up the War of Resistance. After four years of arduous struggle, they finally achieved the final victory at Yorktown in January 1781.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the situation of the American army led by Washington at that time was not much better than that of the Chinese army fighting the War of Resistance today. Originally, all revolutionary wars are fought by people with inferior military strength, inspired by ideals and justice, against oppressors and aggressors with superior military strength. The final victory always belongs to the invaded and oppressed, because their firm belief in their cause, their loyalty, bravery, and their dedication, are enough to overcome all dangers and hardships! (One)</p>
<p>Weekly World Trends From July 2nd to 8th, Year 28</p>
<p>Gong Zhao</p>
<p>(1) War of Resistance Enters Third Year, Our × Faces Altered Situation</p>
<p>Starting this week, the revolutionary war of resistance against Japan by the Republic of China has entered its third year. We salute the national warriors who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines and struggling in the rear, we mourn all the armed and unarmed compatriots who sacrificed for the country and the nation, and we celebrate that after two years of arduous danger, we can now see the distant prospect of the independence, freedom, and happiness of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>In two years of heroic and arduous struggle, the Chinese nation has realized unprecedented unity and unification, established and consolidated the national united front and the program for resisting Japan and building the nation, which is the foundation for final victory, and has begun to develop democratic politics. The total mobilization of the entire nation for liberation has gradually realized progress in political, military, economic, and cultural sectors, enhanced our international status, credibility, and strength, strengthened the united front of democratic peace and friendly nations against fascism and aggression, and exposed and increased the weaknesses, shortcomings, difficulties, and crises of Japan's military, domestic politics, and diplomatic situation in its invasion of China.</p>
<p>These two years have written the most glorious page in the revolutionary history of the Chinese nation and the evolutionary history of mankind. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and other leaders have issued many important documents during the great Double Seventh War of Resistance and National Construction Festival, instructing us that: (1) × In terms of personnel, the quick battle and quick decision policy has been broken, and the "quick peace and quick conclusion" conspiracy has failed. Now they have turned to the poisonous plan of "using war to support war," focusing on mopping up and managing the occupied areas, while carrying out tentative and speculative forward advances, attempting to achieve a situation of neither war nor peace. (2) In the international arena, the situation has taken a tortuous and slow turn for the better. As long as we adhere to the "principle of relying on our own efforts to win external support," international sympathy and assistance will have greater development. (3) In our country, from a national perspective, we have indeed laid the foundation for victory. As long as we adhere to a protracted war of resistance in terms of political strategy, oppose compromise midway, launch a full-scale war, and oppose self-consumption; strengthen unity and unification, oppose conspiracies and instigations, and adhere to an active, comprehensive, and protracted war in terms of strategy, enhance the war effort in the front, expand the battle behind the × army, and intensify the cultivation of the decisive force for counter-offensive; victory will come sooner!</p>
<p>(2) North and South Battlefields Report Success Simultaneously, Warning Alarm in × Rear</p>
<p>Speaking of the military situation of the War of Resistance this week, it is like a gift from heaven, revealing the omen of our army's inevitable victory.</p>
<p>First, looking at the southern battlefield, when our × army strongly occupied Shantou, we immediately launched a large-scale counter-offensive in western and northern Guangdong. This week, there was good news: First, our army counter-attacking Xinhui Jiangdou repeatedly entered the city, engaged in fierce battles for days, and wiped out the × army in large numbers; Second, in the Beijiang area, they attacked Yu and advanced in multiple directions, forcing × Dian to flee to Guangzhou in panic. Now Guangzhou is under our army's control. As for the Lingdong area, our army is still engaged in fierce battles with × forces in the suburbs of Chaozhou and Shantou, and has repeatedly attacked the roads around Chaozhou and Shantou, all achieving victories. However, × people are threatening the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, from Dinghai in Zhejiang all the way to Beihai in, with their × boats and warships "advancing and pressing as opportunities arise," which cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>Looking again at the northern battlefield, the × army's attempt to invade Shaanxi in western Shanxi has failed, while the war in southwestern Shanxi continues to be confusing. In the area bordering Outer Mongolia, the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces have repeatedly defeated the Japanese × army in the past week. Our northern Chinese troops took the opportunity to launch counter-offensives in multiple directions, achieving great victories. Now, on the northern bank of the Yellow River, in the area of Yongji Fenglingdu? Most of the army has moved north and fled east, and the military situation in North China is expected to make smoother progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, although there have been no major changes in the war situation in various places such as Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan, the guerrilla warfare behind the × army has generally developed greatly, and on the Jingzhong Road in central Hubei, another victory was won on the first of this month, and five hundred × soldiers were all killed.</p>
<p>Finally, our battles behind the × people also have new developments. First of all, in the areas of Chu, Jing, Shanghai, Pingjin, guerrilla warfare is very active. The Jinghu Road has been unable to operate for many days in the past week, and the suburbs of Pingjin have also been attacked by our army from time to time. In addition, according to a Jin dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd, anti-war elements of the × army are active in various parts of the Northeast, and the puppet army is wavering and defecting. Since the Japanese and puppet troops have provoked Mongolia, incidents have been serious. And in Suiyuan, our army has recently turned active. Our Mongolian and Han military and civilians are closely united and launching counter-offensives. Do not underestimate these small victories. You must know "taking the rear of × as the front, accumulating small victories into big victories" is our secret to victory.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Jingwei Arranges Puppet Show, Chairman Chiang Righteously Punishes Traitors</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Japan is attempting to create a situation of neither war nor peace in order to consolidate and manage its forcibly occupied areas. To achieve this plan, a relatively strong traitorous regime is indispensable. Thus, Wang Jingwei has volunteered 'loyally and bravely' to arrange a puppet show for the Japanese × army. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd, the list of the pseudo-central puppet organization that is about to appear is tentatively set as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman: Wang Jingwei (traitor)</p>
<p>Finance: Wang Kemin (traitor)</p>
<p>Justice: Jiang Kanghu (traitor)</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs: Chen Zhongfu (traitor)</p>
<p>Education: Tang Erhe (traitor)</p>
<p>In addition, it is also rumored × that in order to coordinate the relationship between the northern and southern puppet regimes, it is also planned to establish a special committee in Nanjing by Wang, chaired by Wang, to prepare for the organization, joint government, and to negotiate with Liang Hongzhi (traitor), Wen Zongyao (traitor), Chen Qun (traitor), and others. Also worth noting:</p>
<p>1. They still plan to secretly use the Blue Sky White Sun flag to deceive the public;</p>
<p>2. Stealing the name of "Three Principles of the People";</p>
<p>3. Organize the "Anti-Communist Kuomintang"</p>
<p>4. Organize the "Anti-Communist Nationalist Government", attempting to absorb wavering, selfish, and unself-respecting and unconfident scum, as a pillar for its traitorous actions.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Wang's conspiracy of "peace" and "anti-communism" is completely serving the Japanese × army. This is intolerable to the people of our entire nation who do not want to be slaves. The supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, pointed out solemnly in his proclamation on the two-year anniversary of the July 7th Incident that Wang and his group's activities are insane, and that "those who do not want × people are already holding the grave to bury him himself, disregarding the country, and willing to be buried with × people"! Today, we must also pay attention to the selfish, self-interested, and those who betray their conscience, lose confidence, and rely on friction to get by and make a fortune during national disasters, who are also creating flags such as "peace" and "anti-communism" to respond to Wang's "soul-calling"—they are truly like Chairman Chiang's proclamation says "they want to let glorious nation be buried with him as funerary objects"—we cannot tolerate it.</p>
<p>(4) Anti-Aggression Upsurge Rises, Britain, America, and Soviet Union Compete to Help Us</p>
<p>Because our country has unanimously persisted in the War of Resistance, our international reputation and status have been increasing, and the international aid movement for China is also becoming more extensive and powerful.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the second anniversary of China's War of Resistance and expand the movement to aid China, the British Aid China Committee specially launched a "China Week" to mobilize British public opinion to help our country. They specially publish a daily newspaper for this purpose, named "China News," and held a mass rally on the 5th. In the United States, most of the pro-China groups that advocate strong aid to China also held a "China Week" on "July 7th." On July 7th, our overseas Chinese held a grand parade, led by Ambassador Hu Shih, and US Democratic Senator Thomas and labor unions also actively participated.</p>
<p>Regarding the Far East issue, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky visited the US Secretary of State Hull on the 30th of last month. Washington attached great importance to this factory and believed that it would have a significant impact on Soviet-American relations. It is reported that the Soviet ambassador discussed the progress of the Far East situation with Hull and inquired whether the United States would adopt its traditional policy towards the Far East. Hull stated that "the purpose of the United States cooperating with other countries in diplomacy is to prevent aggression by force." The Soviet Pacific Fleet also plans to hold large-scale exercises near Vladivostok, while other naval exercises will be held in the Black Sea. Following the Anglo-French Singapore military meeting, the United States and Britain began to take consultative steps on the Far East issue, which will naturally further develop the anti-aggression movement in the Far East.</p>
<p>(5) Mongol-Soviet Allied Forces Annihilate × Troops on Border, Japanese Troops in North China and Outside the Pass Are in Panic</p>
<p>This week, more intense battles took place on the border between Outer Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and the puppet, and the day of the war against the Japanese × army. In order to divert domestic and international attention, to lure Britain into abandoning aid to China and to please Germany and Italy to strengthen their aid to the latter, they constantly launch provocations against the Soviet Union and Mongolia.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese × army's provocation failed: First, today's Outer Mongolia is already a country of church doctrine. Politics, military, and economics have made great progress. The Mongolian nation, inheriting the glorious tradition since Genghis Khan, and recently inspired by the success of the Soviet Union's revolution and the Chinese nation's insistence on unity and resistance to Japan, has become one of the strongest pillars of the anti-aggression front in the Far East and the Chinese nation's war of resistance, and will never condone the × people's and is determined to inflict merciless on them—Second, the Soviet Union has long firmly stated that it must fulfill its obligations under the Mutual Assistance Agreement for Outer Mongolia, send troops to assist Outer, and any invading forces. Therefore, this time the Japanese × army's provocation has attracted a great disaster, I am afraid that it is not just a loss of soldiers.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, the Japanese × Kwantung Army announced that on the 2nd, the Japanese army began to attack the Mongolian and Soviet troops south of Hulun Lake. The scope of the battle was larger than any previous one. Both sides used tanks, armored troops, artillery, cavalry, and aircraft. At dawn on the 3rd, the Japanese and puppet troops again launched a joint air force attack on the Nomon troops, but they all collapsed. And east of the Kherlen River. were occupied by the anti-Communist Allied Forces. From the 3rd to the 5th, the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces launched a general counter-offensive, not only recapturing the southeastern part of Tsairchao and the west bank of the Khalkha River, but also annihilating more than 800 Japanese soldiers, capturing 50 tanks and shooting down 45 Japanese aircraft; the Soviet-Mongolian army suffered 100 deaths and 200 injuries. Loss of 25 tanks and 9 aircraft.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese × army feels that the situation on the Mongolian-Manchu border is serious and that its troops are insufficient, and there are no troops to be transferred from the country, so it will transfer the North China × army. To be used, troops, cars, gasoline, tanks, artillery, and military supplies have been transported north on the Tianjin-Pukou Line and from Tianjin to North for days. The Kwantung Army in the Northeast is also intensifying its anti-war activities, and executions have also begun to rise up and kill ×. The military difficulties of the Japanese × army are even more serious. However, this is not to say that military operations against China will stop, no, on the contrary, if we do not take the initiative to actively fight, the Japanese × army will still make speculative attacks.</p>
<p>(6) Tokyo Negotiations Begin Next Week, Japanese Launch Large-Scale Anti-British Movement</p>
<p>The Tokyo negotiations in which Japan prepared to use a great degree of enticement and intimidation against Britain will be extended to next week due to the unanimous opposition of the British government and public. Although the authorities of both sides are still actively arranging this negotiation, the conflict of interests between Britain and Japan in China has been exacerbated by the Japanese × army's plot to dominate the Far East. During this period, the Japanese anti-British movement has become even more rampant. In fact, the blockade of the Tianjin Concession has become increasingly strict, the seizure and destruction of British interests in China, and the insults to the British people in China have also become increasingly unreasonable. Especially when British Ambassador Craigie visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the 4th to discuss the negotiation process, Tokyo also increased its anti-British movement. The Japanese military department also issued arrogant demands, saying: "Request Britain to change its understanding of the Sino-Japanese Incident" and abandon its aid to China attitude. After July 5th. Tokyo and other places uniformly held "anti-British movement "mass" conferences" and posted unreasonable slogans such as "Down with Britain's ×× policy" and "Expel Britain from China". On July 7th, in front of the British Embassy in Tokyo, hundreds of Japanese rioters demonstrated, and slogans such as "British must withdraw from the Asian continent" were posted everywhere in the vicinity. At the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma issued a statement, saying that "negotiations should be based on the British truly understanding Japan's position and its purpose in the Far East, and that the negotiations will not be truly resolved unless they benefit Japan's construction of a new order in East Asia." On the same day, Japanese Land Minister Itagaki also issued absurd anti-British remarks, saying that no matter what difficulties are encountered in the future, East Asia must be made East Asia for East Asians. This determination will be bravely expressed in front of the third regiment of aid to China, and there will be no consideration.</p>
<p>The reason why the Japanese × army dares to expand its anti-British actions is precisely because the conflicts between Britain and Japan in the Far East are practically unresolvable, and also because Britain cannot resolutely abandon its policy of compromise.</p>
<p>(7) Chamberlain Emptily Shouts Anti-Aggression, Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Progress</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Japanese × army is advancing step by step in the Far East, and on the other hand, Germany and Italy are eroding the power of Britain and France in Europe; especially the Danzig issue in the past week has been slightly quiet on the surface, but the internal crisis is expanding. All these external pressures have more clearly warned Britain that the sacrifice is coming to the final moment, and peaceful compromise will lead to national subjugation!</p>
<p>Therefore, Prime Minister Chamberlain could not but firmly declare his determination to resist aggression—he said in a nationwide broadcast on the 2nd of this month: "We ourselves are peaceful people and have no intention of conflicting with anyone; however, outsiders must not misunderstand that we have absolutely no determination to resist aggression with all our strength. When necessary, whether it is direct aggression against our people or aggression against countries that have obtained our guarantees, we will deal with it with all our strength." And regarding the Japanese × army, British Foreign Minister Halifax formally informed our Ambassador Koo Wei-chun on July 7th that Britain would not compromise on any major issues in the Tokyo negotiations.</p>
<p>However, the British government's sincerity and strength are located in Britain itself, and most knowledgeable people cannot help but express doubts—just look at the negotiations on the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. This was originally a method for Britain to try to protect its own security in the east and west and to protect the peace of all countries in the east and west, but the British government has not yet abandoned its "half-cut policy" and has not abandoned its attempt to use and play with the Soviet Union, only when the situation is pressing. The attitude has turned for the better.</p>
<p>In the past week, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have gradually shown signs of becoming hotter. However, Britain suddenly put forward counter-demands on the 3rd, requesting the Soviet Union to give the Netherlands the same guarantee, and extend it to the Netherlands, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, and Portugal, which have already been guaranteed by Britain. On the 4th, the British side advocated issuing a joint declaration first, and temporarily setting aside the guarantee issue. In fact, this would only weaken the true meaning and strength of the negotiations, especially making the negotiations drag on and cannot succeed immediately. And shirking responsibility to the Soviet government</p>
<p>This situation cannot continue. The British people, especially the vast British workers, have repeatedly shown this. Recently, they have been stepping up their efforts to launch an international workers' united front in order to strengthen the alliance between workers in various countries and nations seeking independence and freedom to resist fascist aggression. This is a force that we cannot ignore—we must strive for, consolidate, and develop this great force.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Heavy Fighting Resumes in Southern Shanxi; Cantonese Provinces Launch Counter-Offensives, We Hold the Advantage; Total Japanese Military Deaths Reach One Million <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, August 8th] All battlefields are experiencing fatigue in fighting strength. There are no major battles currently. Although there have been troop movements in southern Shanxi, there has been no actual increase in forces. It seems there are no new intentions. Localized contact has occurred in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Small battles have continued in the vicinity of Kuannan, Xinhui, Jiangmen, Zengcheng, and Conghua for days, where we hold the advantage. Our guerrillas are also active in the suburbs of Guangzhou, achieving considerable success. Japanese forces in western Shandong's Heze have suffered heavy casualties during our counter-offensives. Fierce fighting has also continued in various parts of southern Hebei for days. Japanese soldiers in various parts of North China are tired of fighting. At least a dozen parts of the puppet army have recently defected, both large and small.</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong News] Western newspapers report that Chinese Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, in a speech on the seventh of July, stated that from the start of the war in Hangzhou to the end of June, "Japanese military deaths have reached 917,800, and 8,555 have been captured." He also stated that although the Japanese could conscript 2.9 million soldiers, they must deploy a portion of their forces against the Soviet Union, and their troop resources are now depleted. China, however, still has strength because Japan has many enemies, while China has only one.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, July 7th] The once-dormant southern Shanxi battlefield has seen fierce fighting since the 6th. Approximately 10,000 Japanese troops from Yicheng and Jiang County have launched an offensive in three routes. One force of about four to five thousand is advancing via Nanchang Village and Po. Another force of about 2,000 is advancing from Shimen. Another force of nearly 2,000 is advancing from Diaoshan Gully. All are launching fierce attacks under the cover of aircraft. Our defending troops on all lines are calmly engaging the enemy. In particular, the fighting is fierce on the Diaoshan Gully front, with intense hand-to-hand combat. In short, there will be news developments on the southern Shanxi battlefield within two to three days.</p>
<p>Situation Improves in Jieyang; Chaotic Fighting in Northern Section of Chaoshan Railway</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Liuhuang, July 7th] On the afternoon of the 5th, over a hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked our Jieyang Tinggang. A certain unit, taking advantage of the Japanese troops' unstable foothold, joined forces with local militias to encircle them. The Japanese were unable to resist and retreated in disorder. Our troops are now pursuing the enemy in victory, having killed over thirty Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>[Continental News Agency, Urgent Dispatch from Liuhuang] According to Chaoan, the Japanese remain trapped with no progress. On the evening of the 6th, our troops circumvented the south of Chaoan and attacked Hechao Fuyang in two routes, engaging over two hundred Japanese troops. The Cheng Hai Japanese were cut off. The chaotic fighting continues in the northern section of the railway. We hold the advantage. Furthermore, according to news from the Jieyang County Government here on the 6th, there has been no major fighting in Jieyang in recent days. The Japanese, both on land and at sea, have been intercepted and severely attacked by us, and their momentum is exhausted. Our troop strength is abundant, and the situation has improved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Liuhuang, August 8th] On the 4th, multiple Japanese gunboats attempted to land at several locations near Jieyang. They were all fiercely intercepted and repelled by our forces. The Japanese then chose to flee.</p>
<p>Stable Situation in Jin-Ji Border Region; Multiple Japanese Military Encirclement Attempts Fail</p>
<p>[People's Revolutionary Society News Agency, Xingji, July 7th] Recently, our reporter had a detailed conversation with a senior military officer here regarding the war situation in the border region. The fact that our border region directly threatens the Japanese military's four communication lines of Pinghan, Zhengtai, Tongpu, and Pingsui in North China is a fatal wound to the military and political efforts of the Japanese and puppet forces in North China. Therefore, they have repeatedly concentrated their forces to encircle us. However, because our forces are flexible and the cooperation between the military, government, and people is appropriate, each Japanese military attempt has ultimately failed. Since the 19th of last month, the Japanese have launched encirclements from Pingding, Wutai, Quyang, and Meng County. Wutai deployed about 8,000 Japanese troops, with over twenty artillery pieces and eight aircraft, and advanced southeast from Dongye, Taicheng, and Hebian. They fought fiercely with a certain unit of ours for two days and nights at Yaotou Baihouzhen Chuziyuan and other places. Both sides suffered considerable casualties. On the 21st, another unit of ours attacked the rear of the Japanese forces. On the line between Luojiazhuang and Bujia Zhuang, there were four hand-to-hand combat encounters, killing and wounding over two hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese momentum was thus checked. Over a thousand Japanese troops from Meng County also attacked northeast via Shangyu on the same day. Over a thousand Japanese troops from Yangqu Beidayu, with six or seven artillery pieces, attacked Changxingzhen to the east on the 20th of last month. A certain detachment of our forces fought fiercely near Yangxingzhen. Our troops occupied the surrounding hilltops and fired at the Japanese, who then fled westward in disarray. The Japanese forces from the Pingding area, concentrated from Niangziguan Yangquan and other places, numbered over two thousand. They invaded Hongzidian and Tunjue in northwestern Ping Shan and joined up with the Japanese forces in Shangshe, launching a large-scale eastward offensive. After a certain unit of ours intercepted and attacked them in the Ziyucun area, fierce fighting ensued. Because the main forces from the Wutai area had suffered setbacks and the mop-up plan was broken by our integrated attack, the Japanese forces on each route retreated to their original defenses on the 25th and 26th. It is estimated that in this campaign, we fought fiercely with the Japanese for a week, killing and wounding six to seven hundred Japanese soldiers. We captured many spoils of war. Furthermore, the morale of the Japanese troops attacking our region this time was unusually low. Even under the cover of concentrated artillery fire, they dared not advance. Most of them were new recruits, so in just a few days, they were defeated by our two units.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Fall of Dinghai City: Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Land on Three Routes; Zhoushan Middle School Principal Detained; County Magistrate Holds Fast on Isolated Island Awaiting Reinforcements <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Dispatch] Detailed reports on the fall of Dinghai have only just been obtained. A merchant who experienced the events firsthand and escaped to Shanghai has provided the following account:</p>
<p>Landing Situation</p>
<p>The Japanese military seized Dinghai by landing at three locations: Tuo, about eighty li from the county seat, Shenjiamen, Zongcang Village, about ten li south of the city, and Daotou and Dongyueguan. The Japanese troops landing at Shenjiamen arrived at the city last and entered the city from the east gate. The Japanese troops landing at Zongcang were next, entering the city from the west gate. The Japanese troops landing at Daotou launched an attack on the county seat from the south gate. The number of troops on the road was about 1,400. Because they had guides, they all took winding paths as if they were familiar with the area.</p>
<p>Principal Detained</p>
<p>When the Japanese troops landed at Daotou, they strafed with machine guns. Two ships fired on the shore from Jiangxin, Daotou. The Quanda Garden at Daotou was destroyed. At that time, Zhoushan Middle School Principal Xiang Fangyuan and Christian Church Pastor Chen Dehong boarded a Japanese warship together, demanding that the Japanese military withdraw and not devastate the area. They were detained by the Japanese military, seemingly to be used to organize a so-called "Maintenance Association."</p>
<p>Fighting at Baiquan</p>
<p>At that time, the troops stationed at Pucisi Temple in the northern suburbs, as well as all the self-defense forces in Dinghai, resisted under the leadership of County Magistrate Su Benshan. After four hours of fierce fighting, they were outnumbered and retreated towards Fanhe Ridge. They have now engaged in fighting in the Baiquan, Xiaozhan, and Dazhan areas. As for the residents of Dinghai City, they all evacuated to the mountain villages as soon as the incident occurred. In total, only thirty to forty people were killed or wounded. However, the grain stored in Dong Baihe and other places was looted. Therefore, the food supply for the troops and civilians evacuated to the mountains is a serious concern.</p>
<p>A Tragic Scene</p>
<p>Due to the suddenness of the Dinghai County Magistrate's situation, he was unable to bring his wife with him at the time. When he was leading his troops in resistance at Fanhe Ridge, his wife was escorted to him by his staff. County Magistrate Su and his wife held hands and sobbed. He said with passion, "When a powerful enemy is pressing in, local officials should only know to be loyal and sacrifice their lives. We cannot think of our families. Please do as you see fit, madam. Take care." After speaking, he bid farewell to his wife with tragic words.</p>
<p>Holding Fast to a Certain Island</p>
<p>It is now known that the County Magistrate has not only dispersed his troops to harass the Japanese military with guerrilla warfare, but he himself has also gone to a certain island by sea, holding fast and awaiting reinforcements. There are still two hundred troops and civilians, and they have already been there for a day. As for his wife, after tearfully parting with the County Magistrate, she was disguised by the county government staff and escorted by boat to Ningbo. She has now gone to Jin Su to personally report the situation to Chairman Huang. Furthermore, when the Japanese troops landed at Daotou, three Japanese aircraft provided cover from the sky. The situation regarding the fall of Shenjiamen is not very clear. It is only known that four Japanese warships fired on the shore that day, and the Jixin Winery in the town was hit.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Resisting the Blockade; Four Countermeasures in Fujian Province; Chen Yi Encourages Officials and People of Fujian <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, July 7th] Chairman Chen has recently issued countermeasures to resist the blockade, encouraging officials and compatriots throughout the province to strive to achieve them. The general meaning of the original text is that the Japanese have recently intensified their blockade of our seaports. We have now planned countermeasures to mobilize human, financial, and material resources. We will intensify our efforts in the future to exert a powerful support force for our long-term war strategy in the military, political, and economic spheres, resist the Japanese side's final-stage tactics of blockade, and prepare to respond to any Japanese attempts. The primary tasks can be roughly divided into the following four items:</p>
<p>(1) Using large-scale wartime civilian wealth and all anti-war propaganda teams to penetrate deep into the broad masses of the people, conduct the most widespread propaganda, stimulate the emotions of revenge and wipe out humiliation, and promote national integrity, using this spiritual power as the foundation for mobilization.</p>
<p>(2) Reclaim wasteland, widely plant wheat and miscellaneous grains, promote cotton planting and animal husbandry, and revive small industries, so that there is no wasteland, no vagrants, everyone is engaged in production, and the people's lives are stabilized.</p>
<p>(3) Strengthen local self-defense capabilities, utilize all civilian weapons and manpower to serve the cause of defending the country and protecting the homeland, and implement unified control and management of food and essential daily necessities.</p>
<p>(4) Rigorously strengthen the self-defense forces of the masses and eliminate traitors. This will be the standard for evaluating counties, cities, and districts from now on.</p>
<p>The article also stated that the Japanese blockade only increases its own disadvantages. Conversely, if we guide the situation and vigorously implement countermeasures to resist, it is a great opportunity for us to regenerate ourselves through our own efforts. We are confident that our compatriots have excellent resources and the ability to endure hardship and hard work. We can sweep away the habitual practices of complacency and procrastination, make up our minds, utilize abundant materials, pool our wisdom and efforts, work hard and fast, and strive together to be the first in the world. In today's situation, success is assured. Victory is certainly on our side.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, August 8th] According to Chinese sources, the "Manchurian Express" train managed by the Japanese Central China Company encountered a landmine explosion near Wuxi on July 7th. Fortunately, the driver stopped the train in time, averting a terrible tragedy. However, the locomotive was largely destroyed, and although there were reports of injuries, none were confirmed. Traffic was interrupted for a long time. A large Japanese force rushed to the scene after hearing the news to search for Chinese guerrillas, believing that they must have been responsible in commemoration of the "July 7th Incident."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, July 7th] Today is the second anniversary of the Chinese War of Resistance.

<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, August 8th] In this great victory in the Zhongtiao Mountains, our army adopted the "sausage-eating strategy." These words came from the mouth of a certain commander who personally directed the battle. According to him, the Japanese advance into the Zhongtiao Mountains, numbering about 20,000, resembled a string of sausages stretched across the mountain range. We lacked the strength to eliminate them entirely, so we resolved them segment by segment, defeating them individually, just like eating a sausage. We cut and swallowed one piece at a time, thus achieving the annihilation of the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi. Previously, in the great victory in northern Hubei, we had the glorious tactic of "opening the bag to catch the rats." This time in the Zhongtiao Mountains, we vanquished the Japanese with the "sausage-eating strategy." These two achievements complement each other, north and south, and are truly a great tale from the war of resistance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, August 8th] Geneva, July 7th, special dispatch. Today is the anniversary of the July 7th Incident. Overseas Chinese here held a meeting at the League of Nations representative office to commemorate it. Everyone also voluntarily donated one day's living expenses. Many Swiss newspapers published the declaration of the overseas Chinese, which detailed Japan's aggressive policies, which have been foiled by China's heroic resistance over the past two years, and called on European countries to continue to provide relief to Chinese refugees. Zhu Xuefan, the Chinese representative attending the International Federation of Trade Unions, met with representatives and journalists from the conference today and discussed ways to obtain resistance films.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, August 8th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, at the request of the American Anti-Aggression Committee, broadcast a speech to the United States yesterday, urging all countries to fulfill their obligations under their treaties and implement economic sanctions against Japan, as well as provide material assistance to China. Madame Chiang argued that economic sanctions against Japan and material assistance to China would both lead to Japan's collapse sooner.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Chiang Kai-shek Addresses Compatriots on the Battlefield <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Today, we can only achieve true peace through resistance and victory. There is no other way. If we were like the traitors, fearing death and surrendering midway, the so-called peace they speak of is a shameful act of inviting thieves into our homes. Since the word "peace" existed, it has never been so desecrated. The peace spoken of by traitors is the peace of slaves, the peace of extinction. We have no other name for it, but we can call it "traitorous peace." We, the Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, possess integrity and spirit. When those traitorous Japanese boast and brag, we must be even more determined, actively maintain our dignity, and demonstrate the spirit of heroic struggle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the Japanese military's evil scheme of "using war to sustain war." This is to further consolidate their occupied areas, exploit the blood and sweat of our compatriots, and use it to fund their slaughter of our compatriots. The Japanese have recently deployed most of their military force in their so-called "mop-up" operations, and economically, they have progressed from initial blockade, destruction, and plunder to their so-called "development" and "construction." We must ensure that the Japanese plan to "use war to sustain war" becomes a dead end for them. We must not only focus on military "counter-mop-up" operations but also pay attention to economic "anti-development" and "anti-construction" to thwart the Japanese plan to drain our blood and prolong their demise. To achieve the above objectives, I specifically propose several points for various areas behind enemy lines to refer to when launching counter-mop-up warfare:</p>
<p>First, in areas surrounded by the Japanese, strive to disrupt Japanese transportation and "construction" to exhaust the Japanese and shrink their occupied areas day by day, so that our guerrilla bases become larger and stronger. We must launch a broad guerrilla war to contain even more Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Second, destroy all Japanese economic "construction" and their so-called "development" projects. Encourage all the people in the war zone to refuse all Japanese requisitions, refuse to work for the Japanese puppets, do not use Japanese puppet banknotes, do not buy Japanese goods, and absolutely refuse to supply the Japanese puppets with any food or goods. Work hard and live frugally to increase production, cultivate the strength for sustained combat, stimulate the will to resist, and promote national spirit. On the one hand, eliminate all traitorous activities. Everyone must be worthy of being a citizen of the Republic of China and a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. Uphold the Premier's teachings, the Premier's thoughts, and the Premier's legacy of saving the country and the people, and we will not allow the Japanese puppets to alter them in the slightest. In the war zone, distorting the Premier's legacy and spreading the theory of compromise and surrender are all acts of national treason and should be severely punished and sanctioned. Third, implement a spiritual general mobilization and strengthen vigilance. On the one hand, implement the public agreement, raise awareness of resistance, and promote national spirit. On the other hand, eliminate all traitorous activities.</p>
<p>Fourth, intensify the disintegration of the puppet army and promote the return of puppet soldiers. Intensify the pacification policy of opposing the Japanese and resisting the puppets. The people in the war zone should use various methods in this regard, especially for the puppet soldiers, to actively persuade them to display a great and fearless spirit, turn their guns around, and defect to defend our country. Whatever the Japanese oppose us doing, we must resolutely do to resist the enemy and save the country.</p>
<p>Compatriots on the battlefield should especially be vigilant and encourage each other, love each other sincerely, unite as one, and thwart the Japanese puppets' various deceptions and divisive schemes. Recognize that whatever is beneficial to the Japanese is harmful to us. Therefore, whatever the Japanese ask us to do, we must absolutely not do. Whatever the Japanese say is good is certainly bad. Whatever the Japanese say is bad is certainly good. Observe all Japanese words and actions from the opposite perspective to respond and destroy them.</p>
<p>Compatriots on the battlefield, our two years of resistance have indeed laid the foundation for final victory today. As long as we, the entire country, the front and the rear, are closely united, becoming more and more heroic and stronger as we fight, the day when our Chinese nation achieves independence, freedom, and equality is in the near future. There is no doubt that you will be completely liberated from the iron heel. At present, what we need is for everyone to endure pain and not hesitate to sacrifice. If we can fight to the death and persevere to the end, then the more pain we endure, the more secure the happiness of our descendants will be. The more lives we sacrifice, the more we can preserve the infinite lives of our nation. Everyone must redouble their efforts. The responsibility of saving ourselves and saving the country is the natural duty of our upright Chinese citizens, to seek the glory of final victory. (End)</p>

<p>The fourth page has no special titles, such as "Our Newspaper Special Feature" or "Communication," all are filthy words related to anti-resistance men, women, youth, and the film and theater industry. However, they never forgot politics. In terms of content, they often reveal sentences tempting China to abandon England, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and quickly cooperate with Japanese fascists. The reason is said to be: "Japan, a victorious country, has repeatedly proposed peace terms to China, a defeated country (?), but China did not appreciate them and rejected them all. Does it really want to perish?" (On another green paper leaflet, they hope that "the people" will petition the government to make peace with Japan soon, echoing this sentiment.</p>
<p>After all, ivory can't come out of a dog's mouth. The "Peace News" spread such rumors and still didn't fill a small newspaper's page, so it cut and pasted outdated movie advertisements from various theaters in Hong Kong. In order to conceal the source of the newspaper's haphazardness, it also blindly stated that the newspaper was published at No. 12, a certain road in Shanghai (there is no such road name in Shanghai). In fact, are all the people in our war zone such fools that they can be deceived by their doing secret things with lanterns?</p>

<p>— Continued from yesterday's sixth edition</p>
<p>3.  Explaining the reasons why China's War of Resistance Will Certainly Be Victorious and National Reconstruction Will Certainly Succeed</p>
<p>What was said in the previous section is the reason why Japan's invasion is bound to fail, but this alone is not sufficient to clarify that China's War of Resistance will certainly be victorious and national reconstruction will certainly succeed, because if China itself also has elements of failure, the outcome is still unknowable. Therefore, I must further point out to the Japanese people why we can become stronger as we fight, and what exactly is our grasp of the certainty of victory in the War of Resistance and the certainty of success in national reconstruction. Of course, every defeat of the Japanese militarists has increased our strength, but China itself has other positive elements of success, namely, the Chinese nation already has a unified and firm belief—the Three Principles of the People. On this point, I would like to briefly explain. The biggest difficulty in modern China is its inability to unify itself, its inability to awaken, and its inability to solve its own problems. But now it is unified, awakened, and all problems have been solved ideologically, solved properly. This means that China has indeed been unified under the revolutionary principles of the Three Principles of the People, and this is our greatest guarantee for resisting and fighting to build the nation.</p>
<p>The True Meaning of the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>——China's Founding Spirit——</p>
<p>I hope that you, the Japanese people, must recognize the Chinese revolution and recognize the meaning of the Three Principles of the People. If this point is not clear, you will never understand the answer to the problem. You probably also know that China's War of Resistance comes from the spiritual training of nationalism. This is correct, but the explanation is not sufficient. The determination of our national army and people to resist the war is certainly due to patriotism, but our patriotism is different from yours. We recognize that the Japanese people are very patriotic, but your loyalty cannot escape the confines of nationalism. When the country is weak, you only seek wealth and power. After it is strong, you only seek development. Therefore, from patriotism, it becomes aggression, leading to the Japan of today. Simply put, you love your own country but do not respect the patriotism of other nations, and even hate and envy the patriotism of others. You regard yourselves as superior and look down on neighboring people as inferior, filled with narrow, arrogant, and aggressive ideas, thus leading to these two years of brutal and inhumane war of aggression against China. China is different. What we believe in is the Principle of Nationalism of the Three Principles of the People. As explained earlier, our interpretation of nationalism is to strive for China's freedom and equality while respecting the freedom and equality of all nations. In other words, our thinking is thoroughly peaceful and not aggressive. This spirit of loving oneself and loving others is originally the basic characteristic of Chinese culture. However, since the Middle Ages, the evolution of politics has stagnated, resulting in this peaceful spirit showing the malady of being passive, scattered, and weak. In the late Qing Dynasty, foreign troubles were serious, and the country was on the verge of collapse. Our late Premier Sun Yat-sen loudly appealed to awaken compatriots to carry out revolution and build the nation. His thought inherited the orthodoxy of Chinese culture and integrated the essence of modern world doctrines, as well as the experience of revolutions in various countries. The result was the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, to understand nationalism, one must understand the entirety of the Three Principles of the People, because they are consistent and inseparable. Let me simply tell you that China is not the so-called nationalism in the ordinary sense, but nationalism. The difference is that although China is fighting for its own freedom and equality, it has absolutely no selfish or aggressive intentions. At the same time, it has a complete and systematic political and economic ideal and program. In the simplest terms, politics is based on "of the people, by the people, and for the people," and economics is based on equalizing land ownership, regulating capital, and developing the people's enjoyment of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The former is stipulated in the Principle of Democracy, and the latter is stipulated in the Principle of Livelihood. These programs all originate from the inherent ideas of Chinese culture and broadly adopt the advantages of modern Western thought, taking the best and discarding the worst, and forging them into one. Its purpose is to meet the current needs of the country and ensure the permanent happiness of the nation, and finally achieve the ideal of world harmony. Therefore, the internationalism of the Three Principles of the People is entirely peaceful and non-aggressive, and at the same time it is just and full of evolutionary potential. In short, the Three Principles of the People is a revolutionary doctrine.</p>
<p>The Situation Since 1928</p>
<p>——China is in a Leap Forward——</p>
<p>China is a new and rising country that believes in the Three Principles of the People and is on the road to construction. In modern China, the obstacles to revolution actually existed more within the country. Mr. Sun Yat-sen struggled his whole life to awaken his compatriots. After losing our great teacher, although our comrades continued to work hard, ideological obstacles within the country and the party still arose a lot. Some had wavering beliefs or actions inconsistent with their beliefs. Since 1928, due to the government being beset by internal troubles and foreign invasion, many political and economic measures that should have been taken were not implemented. Therefore, we reflect that we indeed have many shortcomings and insufficient efforts. However, what is gratifying is that the general public is making progress day by day. When the Japanese militarists launched a large-scale invasion two years ago, our entire country had already reached a consensus in believing in the Three Principles of the People and had a unanimous enthusiasm and understanding of supporting the revolution and building the nation. At that time, the spirit of sacrificing for the country had already been widely ignited, and we had an unwavering will that would not be eroded by time. Our War of Resistance began with this unified spirit and will.</p>

<p>Now it has been two years since the start of the War of Resistance. Although our sacrifices have been great, our progress has been even greater. The violent aggressors not only do everything they can to destroy and devastate on the front lines, but also carry out inhumane abuse and slaughter of our non-combatant men, women, old, and children in the occupied areas. At the same time, they bomb cities and towns and kill civilians in our front lines and rear areas, performing irrational and ferocious acts every day. However, there are still very large numbers of villages and fishing ports in the occupied areas that are strongholds for our patriotic people to conduct guerrilla warfare. Japan has no ability and not enough troops to eliminate them. However, wherever the Japanese troops pass through, the property of our compatriots is lost, families are destroyed, and many cities and villages are reduced to rubble. At this time, all sectors of the military and civilians cannot help but deeply realize that the fate of individuals and the nation is absolutely inseparable, and they have a deeper understanding of the ferocity of the Japanese militarists, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the greatness of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The Chinese People's View of the Japanese</p>
<p>——Both are Oppressed——</p>
<p>I can declare that all the soldiers and civilians throughout the country who are directly or indirectly loyal to the War of Resistance know why they are fighting and why they are dying. They all know that the sacrifice of all labor and life will definitely be necessary and have a reason and a price. What is the price? It is that the sacrifices of modern people can be exchanged for the freedom and happiness of all future generations, and this freedom and happiness is beneficial to all people in the world, including Japan. This means that the new China of the Three Principles of the People must be built firmly through bloodshed and sacrifice. Such a new China can become a great cornerstone for world peace and progress. At the same time, it can promote the renovation of Japan, so that Asia will not have a second tragedy. Our soldiers naturally hate the various atrocities committed by Japanese officers and soldiers in China, but what they hate is their behavior and their thoughts, and they do not hate their people, because the soldiers are all members of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people are deceived by the propaganda of the militarists, and by erroneous education, and forced orders, so the responsibility lies with the Japanese militarists and not with the Japanese soldiers. Moreover, we know that many Japanese soldiers are intellectuals and good people with professions, and some of them also oppose the policy of aggression, but are forced to enlist in the war. Therefore, although we are determined to annihilate the Japanese army in order to liberate ourselves from Japanese aggression, we have never hated the Japanese people or intended to retaliate. Last year, I revised the regulations on the treatment of prisoners of war, and the food, clothing, housing, and all other treatment for captured Japanese officers and soldiers are the same as those for our own officers and soldiers. Our entire army can sincerely abide by them, moving many prisoners to tears of gratitude. Especially, we do not take revenge... This is because our entire army consists of revolutionary soldiers who believe in the Three Principles of the People, because we not only have the firm determination to resist to the end, but also have a revolutionary belief that is farther and greater than the defense of the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Begin Next Week All British Public Opinion Warns Government Not to Harm Chinese War of Resistance Interests <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Central News Agency, 8th] Tokyo Foreign News. Anglo-Japanese negotiations can be expected to begin next Tuesday. Representatives of the Japanese military authorities who came here from Tianjin are currently holding consultations with the Tokyo military authorities on various issues involving Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The situation is very busy. The two sides plan to discuss everything all day today, and representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military authorities are scheduled to discuss everything in detail tomorrow. Arida will report all the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations at the cabinet meeting next Tuesday morning, requesting the cabinet to express its support for the policy of handling the Tianjin Incident. The Minister of Foreign Affairs plans to draft the agenda of the meeting, and then invite British Ambassador Craigie to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs next Tuesday afternoon to determine the agenda of the meeting, it is said.</p>
<p>[Chongqing Central News Agency, 8th] London, 8th Special Dispatch. All newspapers here are paying close attention to the fact that Japan will send a large number of military experts to participate in the Tokyo negotiations. They all warn the government not to expand the scope of the negotiations. Especially on the Japanese request regarding the currency system in North China, no concessions should be made. "New Statesman" said that the British government is well aware that it cannot make concessions to the Japanese request, otherwise it will have a very bad impact on the United States. "News Chronicle" said that British Foreign Minister Halifax has made assurances to the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, explaining that the scope of Anglo-Japanese negotiations will not exceed the local Tianjin incident. Britain cannot allow the scope of negotiations to be expanded to involve the entire foreign policy issue, because China's legitimate war of resistance is not only important to Britain, but all those who have trade relations with China will benefit from it. Therefore, during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, the British representatives should insist that this issue should be handed over to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty for discussion and should not be raised during the Anglo-Japanese talks. "News Chronicle" said that Japan's attempt to invade China has been halted due to China's war of resistance. This is the best opportunity for Britain to provide financial assistance to China to achieve victory, because China's victory is a blessing for the civilized world. If the Tokyo meeting fails, Britain should step up its assistance to China in order to cope with the Japanese threat. This is Britain's only way out. Otherwise, Britain will have no choice but to surrender to Japan. The result of concessions will inevitably promote the division between Britain and the United States, and force the Chinese people to cooperate with Japan to oppose Britain.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, London, 8th) The British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union have received instructions from their governments. The two ambassadors are scheduled to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again today. The content of the new British and French instructions is unknown, but the press believes that it should include the following three items:</p>
<p>(1) The interests of Britain and France in the Netherlands,</p>
<p>(2) Advocate that the Soviet Union should form a military alliance with Poland and Turkey, (3) Explain the meaning of "indirect aggression,"</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Paris, 6th) Regarding the issue of the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, concluding a mutual assistance agreement, after the Soviet government submitted a counter-proposal to Britain and France, the governments of Britain and France are trying their best to find new ways to satisfy the requirements put forward by the Soviet Union. They have considered several ways and handed them over to the ambassadors of the two countries to the Soviet Union to make a final 'effort' to conclude an agreement of a general nature. If this is not possible, Britain and France may conclude a smaller agreement with the Soviet Union, or issue a joint declaration.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 6th] Foreign Minister Halifax received Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon to discuss the current talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. According to political figures, Foreign Minister Halifax once advised Maisky to come up with suggestions to be closer to the Soviet Union's position. The Soviet Union's reply was too broad, which made the progress of the negotiations inconvenient. However, Britain is still continuing its efforts to establish an agreement of a general nature. People in diplomatic circles said that Britain no longer requires the Soviet Union to guarantee Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, but insists that the Soviet Union should not interpret the meaning of aggression too broadly in the agreement. Regarding this level, the Soviet Union's intention is that disguised acts of aggression can achieve success by attacking explicitly, as can be proved by the past events of Czechoslovakia. Taking this as an example, the countries along the Baltic Sea may also suffer the same threat, and it is necessary to take precautions. Disguised aggression is more cruel than direct aggression and must be prevented.</p>

This cooperation method will allow British aircraft to fly from Britain to southern and eastern France, so that the air force personnel of the two countries can obtain the closest cooperation.

<h3 id="e28">Insisting on Resistance is the Only Way to Survive A Speech by Committee Member Chen Jitang on the Anniversary of the July 7th Incident at Deming Middle School <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, an unprecedented commemorative day for our country. Since the history of our country, the current War of Resistance is the most significant in terms of foreign wars, and the crisis of the nation is also the most urgent in terms of being invaded this time. If we understand the meaning of the War of Resistance and we understand the current danger, then we should know that there is absolutely no other way to survive except for thorough resistance. You read books, of course, you understand the situation of the country and the world, and you have read through the history of China and foreign countries, the current situation. Already shows us that not resisting is not enough to survive, and history tells us that not resisting is not enough to establish a country.</p>
<p>However, some people may still be concerned about their own strength, and therefore have various speculations about the future of the country. I think being rash is certainly not allowed, but abandoning oneself is no different from suicide. China's War of Resistance has been going on for two years without realizing it. This is not only something that people with wavering will could not have imagined, but also something that the Japanese did not expect. If the Japanese had known earlier that China could sustain the War of Resistance, they might not have dared to launch it lightly. Now, the consumption of Japanese manpower, material resources, and financial resources has long exceeded the budget. It is really a great danger for them to use such a large part of their strength in China. Therefore, the Japanese are now sighing that they want to stop but cannot. And we, with materials that are far inferior, have already resisted for two years. During these two years, although we have suffered a lot of worries and pains, there has been significant progress in military, political, and economic aspects. If we can resist for two years, we can resist for three years, four years, five years, and even many years. There is no doubt about this. Because our country's materials are not as good as others, we are particularly distressed, but the goal of victory will always be achieved. We must know that the power of the spirit is above the power of the material, and the material has a time of exhaustion. The spirit has no day of extinction. We should swell up the inherent spirit of "sacrificing oneself for righteousness" left over from thousands of years to fight for the final victory. The various difficulties at present will not only not discourage us, but also temper us and make us unswerving in our determination to resist. The ancients said, "A just army is strong, and a crooked army is old." We are the invaded, fighting for the survival of the nation and for the defense of the invaded all over the world. We are justified and righteous. We have no room for hesitation and hesitation. A dangerous war can be stopped if it can be stopped. I don't know that the initiative of this war is in Japan, not in us; for example, if thieves break into the house, the people in the same room can only rise up together to resist. If the thieves do not leave, the resistance will not stop; our country's war of resistance only seeks not to be invaded. If the Japanese clearly withdraw their troops and return our lost territory, so that we will not be harmed, then true peace can be obtained with a wave of the hand; otherwise, seeking peace is no different from begging for surrender. The right and wrong, advantages and disadvantages in this are very clear and cannot be ambiguous!</p>
<p>Based on the above, our only way is to resist resolutely. Since we understand the reason why we have to fight and have to fight to the end, we naturally have a strong will; since we know that the final victory must belong to our country, we naturally have a very solid self-confidence. When everyone has a strong will and sure self-confidence, they will be able to generate great power; China has the largest population, an extremely long history and culture, and a vast territory and products. This power can really be developed to the infinite.</p>
<p>China is not worried about not having power, but worried about not being able to concentrate its power: union is strong, division is weak. The principle is very simple; and the scattered power is easy to disappear invisibly, sometimes or unknowingly, used in the opposite direction, so as to offset each other. Therefore, first, we must contribute all of our strength to the country. We must know that the survival of the individual depends on the survival of the country. The people are born to seek the survival of the country, and they should also die to seek the survival of the country. If we understand this, the evil root of selfishness can be eradicated from this. I have always advocated that the revolution should start with the transformation of the mind. The lessons of these two years are enough to promote the transformation of our minds. In short, everyone has no selfishness, and then they can contribute their personal strength to the country, and then they can concentrate all the strength, and then they can use the entire national strength to fight for the final victory. Second, our strength should be used for the same purpose and the same steps, so there must be a consistent national policy and a unified leader. Generalissimo Chiang presides over the great plan of the War of Resistance with a selfless spirit. He is our only leader. Under the leadership of the leader, based on the established national policy, we work together with one heart and one mind, and we will eventually have a day when we see the blue sky through the clouds and fog.</p>
<p>You are promising young people. Young people are the vanguard of saving the country. Young people are the cornerstone of the country. If young people do not work hard, the front line of saving the country will collapse, and the foundation of the country will collapse. The lack of prosperity in our country is greatly related to the inability to popularize national education. Since you are the young people of China today, you must shoulder the responsibilities of the young people of China today. You must cultivate noble morals to take on the responsibility of saving the country. You must acquire high-level knowledge to take on the responsibility of saving the country. You must forge a strong physique to take on the responsibility of saving the country. Not only the individual, but also guide all the people, everyone should take on the responsibility of saving the country. The victory of the War of Resistance depends on us, not on others. Everyone is moving forward on the road to victory, and they will be able to achieve victory. Young people are the guide on the road to victory. Work hard, everyone!</p>
<h3 id="e29">Nazi Activities in Scandinavia <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>Originally published in "Paris Evening News"</p>
<p>By C. Blanchard</p>
<p>The Nordic countries are in a neutral position geographically and politically. They are not considered dangerous areas of Europe. However, these peaceful nations now frequently hold military exercises to prepare for the advent of war. The last World War involved almost the entire European continent, but Sweden managed to remain neutral and did not participate. But will Sweden be able to avoid being drawn into war in the future?</p>
<p>People not familiar with the recent political situation in Sweden only remember Sweden's neutrality during the European war. They consider this a friendly act toward Germany and believe that Sweden still maintains a favorable impression of Germany. However, the fact is that the situation has changed greatly. Swedish public opinion has undergone a significant transformation, and the main figure driving this change is none other than the world-renowned Hitler. The Nazi regime threatens Sweden's freedom and progress, causing great shock among the Swedish people.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Hitler's generals delivered speeches in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, promoting Nazism and solemnly pointing out that Sweden is a sparsely populated country with ample land capable of accommodating millions more people. The true purpose of these speeches is not clear. Sweden already has various Nazi organizations, and the Swedish people have begun to resist Hitlerism's intrusion. Due to racial, educational, and cultural ties, Sweden has a natural affinity for Germany. Therefore, the Swedish people's aversion to Nazism does not necessarily equate to disliking Germany. However, with the passage of time, opposition to Nazism and anti-German sentiment are becoming increasingly indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Scandinavian cinema is quite developed. In many films, we can see symbols of anti-German sentiment in Northern Europe. However, this does not mean that Sweden will intentionally deviate from its neutral stance, although the risk of being drawn into a world war is extremely high. Moreover, northern Sweden possesses very rich iron ore deposits of excellent quality, which are particularly suitable for manufacturing war materials. If a world war breaks out, Germany will undoubtedly need Swedish iron ore to produce armaments, while Britain and France will surely try to prevent Sweden from sending it to Germany. Under these circumstances, whether Sweden can maintain its neutrality is a very serious question.</p>
<p>Control of the Kattegat Strait is extremely important, especially for the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has built a large naval base in Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean, but this is not intended to attack Norway or Sweden. Its real purpose is to control some natural ports on the west coast of Norway, so that it can prevent German submarine activities from disrupting maritime traffic in wartime. Therefore, countries preparing for war cannot ignore the importance of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Northern Sweden has many "mountains" that are not only rich in minerals but also have excellent terrain. They are also indispensable sources of iron ore for military industry. Sweden exports several hundred thousand tons of iron ore annually, most of which goes to Germany. If Germany can control Sweden's iron ore resources, it would greatly benefit its expansionist ambitions.</p>
<p>Germany's current advantage in the Baltic Sea cannot be denied. Recently, and have agreed to establish defenses on the Åland Islands, and the Swedish fleet patrols the Baltic Sea. This is indeed a courageous act, but it is unlikely to be very effective. Geographically speaking, the fleet is extremely vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>It is very possible that Germany will not only control Lithuania but also monopolize Denmark, so that Sweden's sea route for transporting iron ore to Germany will be like Germany's territorial waters, and it will also be easier to control the entrance to the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Clearly, we can see that the attempt to control Scandinavia is extremely important for Germany. Nazi Germany, under Hitler's rule, is more aware of these circumstances than anyone else. Perhaps changes will occur in Northern Europe in the near future. Who can predict?</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, July 7] Senator Johnson, representing San Francisco, announced today that 34 senators have jointly signed a declaration stating that they are determined to oppose any changes to the current Neutrality Act by all legitimate and legal means. The declaration stated: "We unanimously oppose the abolition or amendment of the current Neutrality Act to authorize any executive official to determine who is the aggressor in foreign wars. We also oppose it. We believe that our country must maintain true neutrality in any armed conflict." It is believed that this declaration is a threat to the prolonged debate on the government's Neutrality Act amendment. Some senators claimed that this official statement was an open threat to the prolonged debate of the legislative bill. However, government-aligned senators did not feel significantly disturbed by this action. They firmly believe that Johnson's influence is not as strong as it used to be and expressed deep confidence that President Roosevelt will succeed. However, they also acknowledged that a lengthy and intense debate is inevitable.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e36">"Permanent Stationing of Troops"! <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma made a statement on the second anniversary of the "July 7th Incident," in which he mentioned Japan's future policy toward China, stating that the establishment of a so-called "new central government" is not far off. Once this "new government" is established, Japan and "Manchukuo" will formally recognize it. He also solemnly stated: "Japanese troops will remain stationed in Inner Mongolia, North China, and all areas that Japan considers threatened by the Communist Party. It is impossible for the Japanese troops to withdraw completely after the establishment of the new government. The Japanese troops' occupation of various places will be quasi-permanent."</p>
<p>All the traitors, whether openly "anti-communist" and "pro-peace," or secretly, may shout "Imperial Grace" and "Ten Thousand Blessings" for Hiranuma's statement! Because since the Japanese troops are stationing troops in China on a quasi-permanent basis, your lives and actions may be carefree! However, the entire Chinese nation and all the Chinese people must recognize that only by supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, supporting the central national policy, supporting unity and steadfastly resisting Japan can there be a way out! All the ugly content of "peace" and "anti-communism" cannot escape the eyes and ears of the Chinese people!</p>

<p>The Plight of Émigrés</p>
<p>In Shanghai, a long Avenue Edward VII, everyone knows is the most prosperous area of the French Concession, known as "Little Paris". But in reality, if you go and take a look, it's really not "Paris", but "St. Petersburg". On that street, French things are few and far between; but Russian things are available in abundance. Russian grocery stores, Russian jewelers, Russian pharmacies, Russian apartments, Russian restaurants, Russian bars, Russian theaters, Russian dance halls, Russian brothels... and Russian men, Russian women - naturally all White Russians, not Red Russians.</p>
<p>Excluding Harbin, Shanghai should be considered the second home of the White Russians. They envision the French Concession as their "St. Petersburg" - they absolutely refuse to acknowledge the existence of "Leningrad."</p>
<p>The number of White Russians in Shanghai is indeed quite large, and they continue to arrive in a steady stream. But their actual number cannot be known because they come and go without any registration. Who can count them? Among the émigrés, the White Russians are indeed considered the "elders"; their fate of being isolated and helpless is unmatched by others. Just like the Jews who have been expelled from various countries now, they still have the pity of the British and Americans, who are generously providing relief; but when the White Russians lost their Tsar, no one cared. They were met with closed doors wherever they went, so they flowed to this international city - Shanghai. In this free place, the Chinese cannot manage them, and foreigners are unwilling to manage them, so it has become a concentration camp for stateless émigrés, and the White Russians are the main members of this camp.</p>
<p>Among the White Russian community, there are also many talented people. Audley, in his "Shanghai - A Paradise for Adventurers", wrote about the people in a White Russian restaurant:</p>
<p>"...There are indeed many talented people - on any given evening, you only need to select a few, and you can reorganize the General Staff of the Russian Empire. There are plenty of dukes, princes, generals, and colonels here. Similarly, if you want to organize a Moscow song and dance troupe here, it is also a very easy thing. High-pitched singers, bass singers, string players, wind players, as long as you can name them, you will definitely find them here, and even if you select a group, there are still plenty of replacements!"</p>
<p>Indeed, this is not too much of an exaggeration, but unfortunately, fate has made them very unfortunate. Now they have no place to use their talents. Today in Shanghai, the general occupation of White Russians is to open a small shop, work as a clerk in a foreign firm. There are also some who have their own businesses, but they are very few. The most common and well-known occupations for men are as patrolmen in the French Concession police station, or as private security guards. Those who are lower down sell Siberian blankets, or friends who pull and wipe the oil stains from the clothes of others. Some even wander on the streets in front of hotels, speaking a few words of Shanghai Russian. The situation for women seems even more tragic. Maids, dancers, and prostitutes have become their exclusive business. People from Europe and the United States, whether diplomats or foreign soldiers, often fall at their feet, paying for their living expenses.</p>
<p>However, many White Russians, although poor, still seem to have a high sense of self-respect. They feel that the name "Russian" is a bit disgraceful. Therefore, although they speak a lot of broken Russian, they refuse to admit that they are Russian. Some say they are Romanian, some say they are Albanian, some say they are... anyway, a small country in a corner: they are definitely not Russian, they must insist on it.</p>
<p>Although the White Russians are in such a miserable situation, they can never forget the prosperous dream of twenty years ago. Although the hope of "restoring the country" has long been extinguished, they still yearn and dream that one day they will recreate the world and write another chapter in history.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, they have a so-called "People's Grievance Association", which is their organization. The greatest purpose of the association is another longing: "To fight back home". All actions are directed by Semenov, the White Russian leader in "Manchukuo", and Semenov's backstage is the Japanese Kwantung Army, which holds the banner of "anti-communism" in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Not long ago, this good show of "national restoration" slowly began to be staged. Under the leadership of Japan, Semenov wanted to become a "king" in Siberia, but he was awakened by the "Zhanggufeng" incident. Then, he came to Shanghai. Under the slogan of "anti-communism" in Tokyo, three or four hundred White Russians in Shanghai held a meeting at the Leeza Hotel in Hongkou one day last winter, also vowing to join the "anti-communism" and even pledge to be the pioneers of "anti-communism". Alas! This is truly the power of "silver bullets". Naturally, the Russian grandfathers, the generals, have a new industry to make money.</p>
<p>Recently, with the blockade of Tianjin, I heard that the White Russian gentlemen repeatedly want to enter the British Concession in groups to stroll around. It seems that the "way out" is becoming more and more available.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, would you mind making a phone call for me, please?"</p>

<p>Vice Chairman Feng and his wife, Ms. Li Dequan, have a very close relationship. Between the boudoir, General Feng is even more obedient.</p>
<p>When the Northern Expeditionary Army set out and arrived in Zhengzhou, General Feng, due to his busy military affairs, did not care about his appearance. His beard had already grown thick and long. From the perspective of soldiers, this not only did not detract from his image, but added to his majesty. However, one day, he suddenly received a telegram that Madam Feng had already left Xi'an and was coming. This big beard, if seen by the madam, was guaranteed not to receive praise. Therefore, he cancelled most of his beard overnight, leaving only a small part on his lips, becoming a "Jintan-style". By the next morning, he felt that it was still inappropriate, so he modified the "Jintan-style" again, transforming it into a "Chaplin-style". When his wife arrived, they exchanged pleasantries. Accidentally, the conversation turned to the distinction between civilized and barbaric people.</p>
<p>"Barbarians are hairy all over, the more civilized, the less hair" Mrs. Feng said. That night, General Feng immediately overthrew "Chaplin" and swept his lips clean.</p>

<p>— Written by Captain Laughton, translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Summary of Previous Excerpts</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1914, Jake, the radio operator of the Chuques Shipping Company, and Billy, the mechanic, took advantage of the German ship's trip to to tour , because Britain and Germany declared war, the British warship was coming to intercept the ship. The ship then fled madly. With great difficulty, they escaped the tiger's mouth and returned to New York. Chuques then asked them to take the "Saint Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to a man named Johnson to send a coded telegram. It turned out that was a German spy called Raviki. Suddenly, the ship mentioned a distress radio call…</p>
<p>"Any more news?" he asked Mullen.</p>
<p>Mullen shook his head, "No, just the first telegram."</p>
<p>Bill was standing in the doorway. At that moment, he suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>"Look, Jack, what's that over there?" he pointed to the horizon.</p>
<p>Looking in the direction he was pointing, a burst of red light surged in the sky in the night. When it rose, it seemed like a blazing iron-smelting furnace. All of a sudden, it fell down, leaving only vague, dim flashes of light. Jack couldn't decide for a long time what exactly it was.</p>
<p>"That's a ship on fire," he later recognized.</p>
<p>At almost the same time, the lookout at the bow of the ship shouted, and the people on the bridge also shouted loudly. They were all reporting that there was such a thing.</p>
<p>Although Jack and the others knew that seeing a ship on fire on the ocean was nothing special, looking at the firelight, rising and falling from time to time, they couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Well, this old fellow is speeding up," Bill noticed that the "Saint Mark" had changed direction and increased speed.</p>
<p>A crew member, Mr. Wood, led several sailors. They were busy untying a small boat, preparing to lower it into the water. In addition, there were three more small boats, ready to carry the rescued people.</p>
<p>As the "Saint Mark" sailed toward the large ship, the fire became more intense, but the distance was still too far to see clearly what kind of ship it was.</p>
<p>"I want to find a way to get on a small boat," Jack said to Bill, as they watched the people preparing to launch the boats into the water.</p>
<p>"Me too," Bill agreed. "Do you think there's a chance?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. However, on the day the ship sailed, I sent a telegram to Mr. Wood's sick mother for free. This might leave a good impression on him. Anyway, I'll go ask him."</p>
<p>Jack confidently went to find that stubborn fellow and talked for a long time. He returned to Bill's side, smiling.</p>
<p>"It's done," he said. "It was really not easy to get his consent. In the end, I still convinced him, we're going."</p>
<p>"That's great!" Bill cheered. "Now, we need an oilskin coat, this kind of weather, it's indispensable."</p>
<p>"I have one myself," Jack said, "I'll go get it, you borrow Mullen's."</p>
<p>"Thank you—look at that fire, it's like a blast furnace."</p>

<p>Shanghai, Chinese Shanghai, newspapers are not allowed to write the words "July 7th", are not allowed to publish Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's announcements and speeches; what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Shanghai, the police of the two special districts carried out a large-scale search, arresting more than 300 people – of course, they are Chinese. But no crime is specified, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>On the occasion of "July 7th", people always feel a little uncomfortable, wanting to regret not having done something in the beginning; but they can't back down. So, the Naval Air Force to vent their anger – again and again, they went to bomb Chongqing. Bombs fell next to the British warship "White ", and in front of the US Ambassador's house. None hit. I don't know what the executioners are thinking.</p>
<p>Local singers, singing girls, "July 7th" charity performance, with good results. The singers raised 1,572 yuan, the singing girls raised 2,039 yuan. From this it seems that there are still many people in Hong Kong who love this tune.</p>

<p>Two newly married couples, who moved into their new home not long ago, suddenly received a letter one morning. When they opened it, in addition to two first-class theater tickets, there was no sender's name or return address. After the initial joy, they pondered all day: "Who on earth sent it?"</p>
<p>That night, they took the tickets and went to see the play. When they returned home after watching the play, they discovered that everything in the house had disappeared, except for a note left on the table, which read: "Now, you know, right!"</p>

<p>The Spartans, valuing martial arts over literature, hated talking too much. Once, a small island in the Aegean Sea suffered a famine; they sent someone to Sparta for help. The representative arrived in Sparta and, applying civilized methods, tried hard to describe all kinds of tragic disasters, but the Spartans said: "We forgot what you said before, and what you said later had no head and no tail."</p>
<p>The representative returned empty-handed, the people on the island were desperately waiting for food. Helplessly, they sent another representative to ask for help a second time, instructing him to say as little as possible before leaving.</p>
<p>This representative arrived in Sparta and acted accordingly, without saying a word. He opened the empty flour bag, demonstrating with his hands, asking them to fill it up. As a result, guess what, he returned fully loaded.</p>

<p>In yesterday's public baseball league game, China played against South China. China's pillar player, Lin Ye, was absent due to circumstances, and the whole team's communication lost its center of gravity. Many supporters of China were worried about this.</p>
<p>South China, however, had a surprise soldier. Zheng Biao, who had been called for thousands of times but did not appear, surprisingly descended the mountain and made an appearance. Other strong players such as Cen Guanlan and Zheng Bin also followed the coach, making the military appearance grand. In the fierce battle, South China, relying on the power of its new army, performed strongly. Chinese hitters were controlled by their fielders at every turn, making scoring extremely difficult. In the third inning, China's Guodong, Bingnan, and Rongjun successively reached base, forming a good situation of bases loaded. Zheng Kangyong threw a wild pitch, and He Xiancheng was unable to catch it. Guodong then rushed back to home base, scoring one point. Enron, who got a free first base, again made it bases loaded. Bingnan was eager to rush back to home base, but He became quick-witted, throwing the ball to Zheng Biao, who successfully sealed it, resolving the Chinese "bases loaded" advantage. After a while, Hu Zhengqu struck out three times, dejectedly retreating. Although Cai got a free first base, Zhong Cansen's high fly ball was caught, and the whole inning ended. In this inning, China's momentum was exhausted, and South China managed to resolve the situation step by step, showing that South China's defense had made progress.</p>
<p>After six innings, South China still led China by six to four. At this point, South China deeply felt the undesirability of "burning beans to cook beans", and out of personal favor, conceded a point to China, giving them a chance to win. Therefore, in the last inning (seventh inning), when China attacked, the road to Sichuan did not seem difficult. Rongjun, Lunying, Er Zhengqu, and Bingfen hit as they pleased, scoring four points in a row, turning defeat into victory. Head referee Ho (Burmese third baseman), and first base side witness Leonard (Youbei team shortstop) could not stand it, burning with jealousy, and used the excuse that the two teams' competition was childish, ordering the cancellation of the game. Foreign spectators also left one after another, but the China and South teams denied that this was the case and insisted on finishing the game. The two witnesses, seeing that their orders were ineffective, abandoned their posts and left. The China and South teams then agreed to ask someone to temporarily serve as the referee to end the game, pending future resolution. As a result, China scored a total of six points in this inning, defeating South China by ten to six. The scores of both sides are recorded below.</p>

<p>Today at 10:00 am, a public baseball league game will be held at Caroline Hill field, with only the Western Association playing against the Hong Kong Association. A fierce battle is expected between the two sides, but the Western Association, which is improving daily, may have the upper hand.</p>

<p>— Chen De</p>
<p>June 12th</p>
<p>After breakfast, we prepared for our departure to Singapore tomorrow. Today is the last day of our stay in Saigon. Having been preoccupied by the intense matches of the past few days, we are now free to take a stroll along the pier. Some of our teammates took the opportunity to purchase French products. Due to the strict tariff barriers of French Indochina, goods from other countries are very expensive, while French products are relatively cheap. So, if people buy something, they tend to choose French products because they are more affordable. After our outing, Mr. Liu, a leader of the Hui Zhou community, and Mr. Zhang Zhenfan, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, will host a banquet at the Chamber of Commerce at 7:30 PM this evening to bid farewell to the team. Fei Zaiqi is especially excited about this and keeps urging his teammates to "stay" for the banquet. Everyone who hears this bursts into laughter. Yingqi is truly innocent!</p>
<p>In the evening, we arrived on time. Both community leader Liu and chairman Zhang delivered speeches at the banquet, and team leader Mo also gave a speech to express his gratitude. We dispersed after 10 PM, having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.</p>
<p>June 13th</p>
<p>At 9 AM this morning, our team boarded the French postal ship "Alimimis" to Singapore. Many members of the Saigon community came to the pier to see us off. At exactly 10 AM, the ship set sail southward. At lunchtime, team leader Mo requested and received permission from the captain to allow us to run on the deck every morning for practice. He also appointed team leader Bao as the temporary coach. Indeed, team leader Bao has rich experience and considerable talent, and he is well-deserved for the role.</p>
<p>June 14th</p>
<p>The sun rises over the sea, and the morning light fills the air. Secretary Zhou has repeatedly woken people up with good dreams, urging them to start practicing. We hurriedly get up and gather on the deck. At exactly 6 AM, Coach Bao gives us instructions one by one. We start with warm-up exercises, then jump rope and run laps for about an hour. By the end, we are all drenched in sweat. After showering, we have breakfast and then take a walk on the deck to aid digestion. The sea is as smooth as a mirror, and the weather is fine. Even Liang Rongzhao, who usually suffers from seasickness, is smiling and cheerful. Otherwise, he would have spent the whole day in bed, how could he appreciate the vastness of the ocean? At night, the bright moon illuminates the sea like a painting. This kind of scene saddens travelers. Many of my comrades quietly lean on the railing, unable to sleep, overwhelmed by their emotions.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Tea Management Methods (Continued from Previous Methods)</p>
<p>is difficult to achieve. This year's plan is to first determine the highest, lowest, and average prices for raw tea, and order merchants to purchase with cash. To prevent price suppression and monopoly, the Tea Department will establish raw tea purchasing offices in various tea-producing areas in conjunction with the Central Trade Commission, purchasing tea at the prescribed prices. If merchants are willing to offer higher prices to compete for purchases, they will be allowed to do so. In this way, the interests of farmers can be enhanced, and the problems that could not be solved with previous passive restrictions can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>(3) Regulating Tea Industry Finance - To enable farmers to improve their production and tea merchants to improve their manufacturing, it is necessary to ensure that they have sufficient funds and can use them freely. At this time of war, financial turnover is difficult, and it may be problematic for farmers and merchants to raise funds themselves. The Tea Department has specially borrowed tea loan funds from the Trade Commission and is lending them at low interest rates. This year's estimate is that it will be over three million. Regarding tea materials, to avoid difficulties and high costs for merchants in purchasing them, it is also planned to purchase them in bulk at the official exchange rate as in-kind loans.</p>
<p>(4) Improving Tea Merchant Equipment - To improve the organization of tea factories and eliminate speculation, a tea factory registration will be held before the tea season, specifying the necessary funds and equipment. After opening, factory managers will be assigned to be responsible for guidance to improve equipment and production, and to accept the opinions of the Trade Commission regarding the various types of tea that are popular in overseas markets, and submit them to various tea factories for reference and compliance, to achieve the goal of rational supply and demand and planned production.</p>
<p>(5) Adjusting Warehouse and Transportation Organization - Warehouse and transportation during wartime are major issues for the tea industry. On the active side, the goals are to speed up transportation, increase transportation volume, and ensure the safety of warehouses. On the passive side, the goals are to eliminate smuggling and tax evasion. Tea warehouse and transportation stations will be established in various important locations, and tea warehouse and transportation businesses will be registered for unified management.</p>
<p>(6) Developing Research and Training - There are many aspects of tea industry reform that need research. The Tea Department will proceed step by step to the best of its ability. However, the implementation of tea policy depends on talent. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the training and development of sound cadres and talents. These talents must not only have sufficient academic ability in tea production technology but also have a full understanding of the entire tea industry policy, and be able to forget self for the public good and struggle hard. In this way, the transformation of the Chinese tea industry will be promising.</p>

<p>"Sinicization" and Literature</p>
<p>— Yu Hua</p>
<p>Due to the arduous struggle of the people throughout the country, the great national self-defense war has finally entered its second stage. The foundation of our resistance and nation-building is becoming more solid, and we have greater confidence in the future of victory. The revolutionary blood of the heroic soldiers is driving our ancient country toward a new and bright path.</p>
<p>With the drastic changes in living environment, our literary workers have also changed their mode of advancement, fighting the enemy on their own front lines, and more literary workers will emerge from the battlefield. These are not coincidences. They will even write out many effective ways to accomplish the difficult tasks of each stage; never frowning or sighing. They smile and wipe away the sweat that steams from their foreheads due to hard work.</p>
<p>Late at night, in the dim light of oil lamps, they strained their eyes. The brushes scratched across the wax paper, and they copied with such seriousness. Lice crawled out of the necks of their worn military uniforms, but they didn't mind. The wax paper was covered with neat, small characters, and they carefully inked and printed it page by page. What was printed was their portrait of the war, and they would shout so enthusiastically: "Comrades, we still need to strive for greater victories!" Some also wrote frankly: "In the next battle, I will definitely chop down more than three devils."</p>
<p>The printed papers were distributed to the companies, platoons, squads, and even the peasants' tobacco pouches. They believed that the printed papers were bullets, bullets that could end the lives of the enemy!</p>
<p>In the past: these phenomena had never existed. In the history of culture over thousands of years, this bright and brilliant chapter will be written. We can say that our generation is ending the old, and our generation is also creating the new. Therefore, the weight of responsibility will urge us to be more energetic and more diligent.</p>
<p>On the cultural front, our literary workers know the specific path to complete the historical mission. Our War of Resistance against Japan has moved from the first stage - preliminary, to the second stage - advanced; and our literature, like all developing movements, also has an inherent nature of developing towards a higher level. Moving from a higher stage of development to a higher level of practice becomes the highest purpose of literature in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>We know that Chinese culture is a fertile land. In the process of evolution over thousands of years, it has also bloomed golden flowers. But when we wander on that vast cultural land, we will find that very few products truly belong to the masses and are preserved.</p>
<p>Especially those great struggles - such as the Taiping Rebellion, etc., the literature at that time, this kind of scene written with reactionary grammar distortions, represented the foolish ruling class fabricating all kinds of unreasonable stories. Why did the peasants at that time fight? Why did they rush out of their fields enduring hunger? These, the authors at that time finally wrote them as a kind of "ferocious" and "barbaric". In fact, the real "ferocious" and "barbaric" reality was deliberately ignored.</p>
<p>Today, the proposal of the sinicization of academics has opened up a wider avenue for our culture.</p>
<p>In recent hundreds of years, compared with international culture, the distance between Chinese culture is so terrible? This does not mean that Chinese culture has no characteristics and cannot rush straight up. The main characteristics are limited by the stage of social and economic development. Therefore, it is as weak and depressed as Chinese society. However, those characteristics still exist objectively.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Reform Movement in our country, to the Xinhai Revolution, to the May Fourth Movement, the two extremes in our country have become more and more acute. These two extremes are: on the one hand, trying to Europeanize as much as possible, and on the other hand, trying to protect the "national essence." The former believed that China's backwardness lies in not being the same as everything foreign. The latter scorned "foreign books," believing that only restoring the old can rejuvenate the country. Some people even called on young people to read the classics to save the country from its misfortune.</p>
<p>In fact, it is a fantasy to turn China into a country that is exactly the same as foreign countries. And it is fundamentally impossible to send a developing historical stage back to those previous historical stages.</p>
<p>Based on these situations, we admit that we do not have enough understanding of the excellent historical traditions of our own country. Young literary workers have neglected the literary treasures that our own country wants. - Precisely because we rarely think about those, we only care about taking things out of the bookshelves of foreign literature. Or we only care about punctuating a thread-bound book. We can say that we have not done as well as our stomach does with food in the work of extracting, digesting, and improving.</p>
<p>As written in the previous paragraph of this article, those passionate inner cries are certainly needed, but in fact, it is impossible for this kind of cry to always become a stagnant state. We will cultivate new emotions in people through rational understanding!</p>
<p>Therefore, we require that literary workers must learn theory, improve their cultural level (this does not conflict with "popularization"), and absorb new ideas from world culture. Following this requirement, we criticize past Chinese literature, study Chinese historical traditions, and extract those essences, which is necessary. Creating a sinicized new literature is not just that. We must also extract the essence of Chinese art to enrich ourselves - this extraction must be integrated with the essence of Chinese literature.</p>
<p>Rigid Europeanization is entirely due to not digesting it.</p>
<p>The sinicization of academics is to make academics suitable for the current needs of China, to make academics an organic part of China's entire culture, and to make Chinese academics an active part of world academics. Our literature, a part of academics, we should stand up and respond to this call - this is entirely an objective need.</p>
<p>In order to make literary works more popular and play a more active role among the masses, our literary workers must first be familiar with materialistic dialectics and use it to understand and criticize Chinese history and culture... At the same time, we must grasp reality. Targeting reality, we write out the works that people need and "promote" people. We know that these are all for the future - the literary land of the new China must be cultivated in our blood and sweat today.</p>
<p>I have seen our soldiers writing "Capture Turhara Alive" on their arms, and some have written words of determination to sacrifice on their hats. These phenomena fully indicate that we are fighting for the survival of our entire nation and the survival of all mankind in the world!</p>
<p>At this point, we need to further understand what is the highest purpose of literature in the War of Resistance.</p>

<p>Rushing to the Motherland</p>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>—Still a story of a girl—</p>
<p>After the planes that had created the poisonous evil had flown away, the young man climbed over and told them that the few freight train stations outside were their target, but they hadn't hit them."</p>
<p>The all-clear sounded, and they all got up. There were sounds of crying nearby, bodies lying silently, or flesh and blood flying everywhere, and the living cried sadly.</p>
<p>"Come on, we can go to the pool to wash our faces."</p>
<p>They listened to him, found a clear water's edge, squatted down, washed the blood and dirt off their faces, and then walked towards the platform.</p>
<p>Ambulances and fire trucks were rushing over, stretchers searching for the wounded, and a large bamboo basket to collect the scattered bones and flesh on the ground, a burst of bloody smell pouring into their nostrils.</p>
<p>"We can be considered as reborn!"</p>
<p>Half of the warehouse was destroyed, the fire was still burning, a large pit had sunk in the roadbed, and the rails had jumped several feet away, like two snakes with shiny leather patterns lying prone there.</p>
<p>"Look, that car over there is the one we took."</p>
<p>The young man pointed, the train had already fallen down, and only the bones were left in a few sections.</p>
<p>"Oh, my little suitcase is still on it!"</p>
<p>Jing suddenly cried out, Qing Zhi said lightly:</p>
<p>"What does that matter, look at those!"</p>
<p>The column of injured people on stretchers walked past the fire, blood dripping from the beds to the ground, and some were already unable to groan, almost like the dead. Under a small tree, they saw a person with two legs blown off. His face was as white as paper, and he was still turning his body; but the stretcher bearers looked at him and passed by, asking very calmly: "He will definitely die, no need to take him to the hospital."</p>
<p>Qing Zhi's heart gave a cold shudder, she thought what would happen if that person was her? She didn't know if that person still had a feeling of pain, or if he could still hear what others said?</p>
<p>Night fell, and she didn't feel hungry at all. After walking away from the station for a while, she seemed to still smell the smell of corpses. The young man kindly accompanied them, asking them where they were going. For a while, they couldn't say. The power went out, and the whole place was dark.</p>
<p>In the distance, suddenly the sound of singing came, gradually becoming louder, a piece of firelight turning from the street corner. At first glance, the light seemed a little unaccustomed to, and after a while, they saw that it was five or six people walking in a line holding torches, they were singing, shouting, the first to walk was a soldier on horseback, they seemed not to fear at all, and did not seem to have gone through a massacre, their steps were very firm, and the leaping flames illuminated two red faces, two pairs of dark eyes, shooting out piercing light. There were young men, and women, workers, and businessmen, and even old people with white beards were not absent. They opened their mouths and sang together; shouting, the whole city was trembling in their sound, the earth was shaking under their steps. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e55">讀「陳二石頭」 <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Reading "Chen Ershitou"</p>
<p>— Han Bo</p>
<p>Literary Front No. 23 Serial</p>
<p>"...He sat next to Chen Ershitou. He looked at Chen Ershitou, but Chen Ershitou ignored him. He looked at Chen Ershitou again, but Chen Ershitou still ignored him. After a while, he looked at Chen Ershitou again, oh! Alas! What's so good about looking at it... After a while, he looked at Chen Ershitou again, this is strange..."</p>
<p>Four consecutive looks, it is really written vividly, if briefly replaced by a sentence "looked at him several times in a row," it would not be as good.</p>
<p>The author's success lies in the delicate and powerful description, and it can be told logically. It will not bore the audience and make them feel that this is:</p>
<p>"A lying swindler!"</p>
<p>But in terms of the ending, I think it is too scattered. Scattering is a common problem of storytelling, and there are not a few nonsense, but since it is called "literature," it is natural to return some literary appearance. At least it must abandon the bad elements in the old form before it can be considered "utilization". The author of Chen Ershitou focuses on the breadth of the "lecture" scope, and forgets this point, which is really regrettable. Especially in the sequel in the third issue of the Literary Front, a deserter officer "Wang Deming" is inserted hard, and one "pull" is more than 10,000 words of "melon", accounting for half of the full text. The author frequently uses these words to try to emboss this character:</p>
<p>"...Look at that look, it's scary enough, his eyes are straight, and his face is turning blue..."</p>
<p>"Outside there is shooting... Wang Deming hugged Chen Ershitou's waist with both hands, he was really drunk."</p>
<p>"Chen Ershitou looked at Wang Deming's pitiful look..."</p>
<p>In short, Wang Deming is described as a cowardly, pitiful and cunning and opportunistic inferior soldier, and the grasp of the dark side of this kind of person is very good, but in the end, I think, how will the author deal with him? Abandoned it? Or moved it? But I can't guess anything, the author finished Chen Ershitou to join the guerrillas, he was listed and then disappeared tracelessly, and even made me not understand the author's original intention of spending so much effort to write this character, if it is to strengthen Chen Ershitou's personality, then it may get the opposite effect. If this is writing the typical representative of the "refugee door", then why is there no follow-up? The most important thing in storytelling is "generation clearing", the so-called "if you want to know what will happen next, listen to the next breakdown" is, although lecture literature does not need any "said" "but said", but simple-minded people value the "cause and effect" the most, the story with a head and no tail is difficult to satisfy their causal view, as a result, Wang Deming will inevitably expand to a general bad phenomenon in the concept of the masses.</p>
<p>Chen Ershitou himself is still well written, vividly like a genuine farmer from Xuzhou Prefecture, and even the smallest lens is inserted very appropriately, but when he turns to become a guerrilla, the author uses the word "suddenly" to perfunctorily pass by; it is really too casual to use some "suddenly", except for these points, "Chen Ershitou" is still an excellent mass literature, a generally successful attempt - I am very happy to say that it has laid a new path for us to utilize the old form. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Pain of Silence <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liunian</p>
<p>Occasionally, when I am free, I seek out a friend for a chat. Because we are both young literature enthusiasts, our conversations invariably revolve around literature, followed by a round of reckless discussions about the bleak situation on this isolated island. After sitting for a while, I picked up Lu Yan's "Traveler's Heart" from his bookshelf and left. My motive for taking this book was simply because I am also a traveler. I wanted to see what a "traveler's" heart is like, and whether we share the same emotions that run through our hearts.</p>
<p>Back home, I flipped through "Traveler's Heart" and discovered my friend's reflections after reading it, in the form of an eight-line poem, expressing "the pain of silence":</p>
<p>A small circle is drawn on white paper,</p>
<p>Can you escape the longing for your homeland?</p>
<p>Oh, traveler's heart!</p>
<p>Falling into a small circle of pain,</p>
<p>Hoping for all comforts to come,</p>
<p>You bow your head and wait,</p>
<p>The bitter, blocked traveler's heart.</p>
<p>Only seeking to enlarge the light of life!</p>
<p>My friend's homesickness is unmistakably revealed in these eight lines.</p>
<p>But what about home?</p>
<p>Under the artillery fire, home—his and mine—apart from a ground resembling a pile of rubble, is nothing but the remnants of shattered tiles and bricks. Thinking of this, the symptoms of homesickness naturally become heavier. Sometimes, one cannot help but entrust some unspoken pain between the lines, to relieve one's feelings, but the deep sorrow remains.</p>
<p>In reality, he lacks a firm "belief." Otherwise, the pain of silence would not have grown in his heart and wounded him. If this continues to develop, he will sink into the most serious mental depression, never able to free himself. To put it bluntly, he is engaging in a slow suicide.</p>
<p>"Final victory belongs to us!" We must abandon this pain of silence, using it as silent hope and effort, to enlarge that circle of life; isn't that so? President Chiang Kai-shek tells us: "The life of an individual is limited, but the life of a nation is endless!" We must enlarge an even greater circle of light.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Report of Foreigners Evacuating Fuzhou is Inaccurate. Hai Cheng Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday with Only a Few Foreigners. Wenzhou Blockaded by Communists. Ship Continues to Chongqing. <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>It is easy for the Communists to invade Fuzhou, threatening foreigners to leave in order to achieve a blockade. Investigations reveal that most foreign residents are not intimidated by the Communists and are determined not to leave. Last Tuesday, a few foreigners transferred to Fuzhou, escorted by British and American warships. The Hai Cheng, which was originally heading to Hong Kong, arrived yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. On this trip to Hong Kong, it carried a total of ten Chinese and Western passengers, along with some luggage, and no other cargo. According to the crew, warships stationed in the Fuzhou sea area have intensified the blockade along the Fuzhou coastline. Foreign vessels are not allowed to enter Fuzhou, and Communist armored speedboats frequently patrol the waters, seemingly to monitor the loading and unloading of cargo from foreign ships. As a result, the loading and unloading of cargo has become quite difficult. The Hai Cheng was also unable to dock in Fuzhou. The Chinese and Western passengers boarding from Fuzhou first boarded the Heroic Duchess and were transferred to the Hai Cheng by small boats. There are still several British and American warships stationed in the Fuzhou sea area to protect foreign residents. Reports that foreigners have evacuated Fuzhou and were transported to Hong Kong on this ship are not true. Only about a hundred foreigners who were forced to leave Fuzhou due to business relations in Shanghai were transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Shipping's Ji Nan a day earlier. Only a few foreigners took this ship back to Hong Kong. As for the situation in Fuzhou city, the ship could not enter the port and could not obtain any information, but the tense situation and heavily guarded state can be seen in general. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou yesterday, but according to a telegram received by the company, Wenzhou was blockaded by the Communists on the 5th, forcing the ship to cancel the trip. The resumption of the ship's route has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="e58">China Traveling Theatre Troupe to Perform "Wu Zetian" on the 13th at the Lee Theatre <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Wu Zetian, the only empress in Chinese history, rebelled against male dominance and the patriarchal social system, giving a voice to women who had been oppressed for thousands of years. Although she lacked profound political ideas and failed to establish a solid foundation, her policies during her reign were not without considerations for the people's hardships, and she should not be labeled as merely "licentious" driven by worldly desires. The life and deeds of this remarkable woman have recently been adapted into plays and films. When the Mandarin film "Wu Zetian," starring Gu Lanjun, was shown in Hong Kong a month ago, it drew massive crowds, demonstrating the attention of all sectors of society. As for stage plays, Song Zhi's five-act drama is both ideologically correct and structurally tight. It analyzes "Wu Zetian's" hatred of men with great detail, portrays the suffering of oppressed women with depth, and provides a concise account and correct evaluation of Wu Zetian's policies during her autocratic rule. The China Traveling Theatre Troupe began rehearsing the play four months ago, starring Ye Dexi and Tang Huaiqiu, and it is scheduled to be performed at the Lee Theatre for three consecutive days starting on the 13th of this month. Other performances include "Tears of a Fallen Flower," starring Ms. Gan Cuige, and the Cantonese play "Five Rams City." Given the China Traveling Theatre Troupe's recent good work and performances, it should be just as good as amateur performances.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Special Report] Since the Philippine government approved the special decree allowing Chinese compatriots to immigrate to the Philippines for a living, some unscrupulous individuals have taken the opportunity to swindle those going to the Philippines, and some have unknowingly fallen for their tactics. Our newspaper's correspondent at the Consulate General in Manila has sent a letter stating that some apprentices in Hong Kong are forging so-called "special refugee certificates" and peddling them to those seeking to make a living in the Philippines, so it is declared that those going to the Philippines should not be fooled. The letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: It has recently been reported that some unscrupulous individuals in Hong Kong are forging so-called "special refugee certificates" and peddling them to those who wish to come to the Philippines for a living, each certificate priced at HK$100. Currently, three Cantonese compatriots have attempted to come to the Philippines with forged documents. They were discovered by the Philippine authorities and immediately apprehended. The certificates of temporary refuge in China issued by this consulate require the applicant to submit an application with a guarantor letter from their relatives or friends in the Philippines, guaranteeing their living expenses. After the application is reviewed and approved by the review committee jointly formed by the Chamber of Commerce of Manila, a letter is sent to the Immigration Bureau requesting approval before the certificate is issued. All certificates bear the official seal of this consulate and the consul's signature. Please publish this letter to prevent our compatriots from being deceived. Sincerely, Consulate General in Manila to the Hong Kong Shen Bao.</p>

<p>Lu Zhaozhen, aged about 32, who lives at No. 44 Yu'an Terrace, Shek Tong Tsui, was attacked by several men at the staircase of No. 25 Nam Li at around 10 AM yesterday morning. The men then fled. Lu suffered serious abdominal injuries on the spot. He tried to support himself by grabbing the handrail and climbed to the third floor of No. 25 to seek help from acquaintances. However, he collapsed due to his injuries. People in the building saw this and provided assistance, and he regained consciousness. He then hired a taxi to take him to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. According to the injured man's family, half an hour before the incident, Lu had a minor quarrel with a woman living in the same building at No. 44 Yu'an Terrace. The argument escalated. Immediately after the quarrel, several thugs went upstairs and looked for Lu to beat him. Lu avoided them and escaped through the back door. When Lu reached No. 25 Nam Li and arrived at the staircase, the thugs followed and intercepted him. The victim's family, unhappy with the thugs' violence, went to the police station to report the case. After receiving the report, police detectives were dispatched to investigate the scene at around 6 PM in the afternoon. They also took five men and women from No. 44 Yu'an Terrace to the station to inquire about the case. After taking their statements, they were released pending further investigation. The police are still searching for the thugs who committed the crime.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to Elect New Chairman on the 15th. Li Xingqu Desired to Continue Leading New Directors. If Li Insists on Resigning, Guo Quan is Expected to Succeed Him. <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The terms of office of the chairman, vice-chairman, treasurers, and directors of the previous session of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong have expired. In accordance with the articles of association, a new election will be held. One hundred new directors were elected on the 6th of this month. Li Xingqu received the most votes in this election. Based on past experience, Li is expected to be re-elected as chairman. However, before this election, Li had expressed his determination to retire and give way to someone more capable, and his intention was firm. Li has repeatedly stated that even if he is re-elected as chairman, he will not accept the position. Therefore, the issue of the new chairman has received much attention from the public. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce is not only the general organization of all Chinese merchants in Hong Kong but also the general organization leading all Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong. Especially during this extraordinary period, the responsibility of its leader is extremely important, so there is great concern for the selection of a new chairman. It has been learned that after the election of one hundred new directors, Chairman Li Xingqu instructed Secretary Cao Xueyu to issue a circular convening a meeting, inviting all newly elected directors to attend the meeting at 2 PM on the 15th of this month (next Saturday) to elect the new chairman, vice-chairman, treasurers, and directors, so that the handover can be held as soon as possible. Secretary Cao Xunyu has scheduled to issue the circular today and tomorrow. At the same time, he will also send letters to the members of various industries, asking them to report the list of representatives and directors so that they can be invited to the meeting.</p>
<p>The mystery of the new chairman will be revealed on the 15th of this month. Currently, the candidates with the highest calls for succession are Guo Quan, Ye Lanquan, Yan Chengkun, Lei Yinsun, Feng Xiangquan, and others. However, many of the newly elected directors still hope that Li will continue to assume the leadership responsibility. It is expected that in the election results, Li may be elected as the chairman. If Li insists on resigning, then Guo Quan is most likely to succeed him.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Civil Defense Authority has established civil defense training classes in various districts. Twenty-two districts have been established in Hong Kong and Kowloon. However, among the students in the twenty-two districts, the number of those who passed the exams and graduated as civil defense instructors and rescuers is less than seven-tenths of the original budget, which is due to residents' neglect of civil defense training. The Civil Defense Authority attaches great importance to this and intends to persuade merchants and residents to actively participate in training in various districts as soon as possible, to avoid being at a loss in the event of an emergency. Yesterday, Liu Jing, chairman of District A, stated that since the district obtained additional construction land from the Civil Defense Authority, it has been urging merchants in the district to send personnel to participate in training. However, the number of people who come to receive training is still very small, and the Civil Defense Authority is particularly concerned about this district, and the number of trainees who have passed the exam is few, the Civil Defense authority made inquiries. It is expected that many merchants will attend this special training program, but something unexpected happened. This is very distressing. I am currently posting a leaflet and today, brother [Liu Jing] and other committee members will personally go to each household in the district to encourage residents to participate and explain the importance of learning civil defense.</p>

Man Falls to Death on Kennedy Road. <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Tang Mei, a 26-year-old woman living on the third floor of 96 Tai Shek Street, Sai Wan Ho, has passed the marriageable age but has not found a husband. She works in a nearby factory. At around 2 AM yesterday morning, for reasons unknown, she suddenly became disillusioned with life. Taking advantage of the fact that her family and housemates were asleep, she jumped from the balcony, landing headfirst on the street. She immediately fell to the ground, her head wounded and bleeding, and collapsed in a pool of blood. Later, a passerby saw her and shouted for help. Her family rushed downstairs and took the injured woman to the Xianli Hospital for treatment. The reason for her suicide is unknown to her family. Before jumping, she showed no signs of distress. Her injuries are severe, and her life is in danger. On the same morning, near dawn, a man was found lying by the road near 56 Kennedy Road, with serious injuries to his head. He was barely breathing. A passerby called the police, and an ambulance took him to Queen Mary Hospital. He died from his injuries after being admitted to the hospital. It is suspected that he was a thief who fell from a height and suffered serious injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Education Department to Eliminate Veranda Classrooms to Ensure Student Safety <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The number of primary and secondary schools that have moved from Guangzhou to Hong Kong is rapidly increasing. However, due to the small area and dense population of Hong Kong, and in light of the serious concerns about building safety, many schools have simplified their facilities. Some schools have even used verandas and open spaces as classrooms. This situation has been found in many places. The Hong Kong Education Department believes that using verandas as classrooms affects traffic flow in the building and raises safety concerns for students in the event of an accident. Therefore, it has ordered schools in all districts to immediately eliminate such facilities and has instructed inspectors to visit schools weekly to ensure student safety.</p>

Eagerly Hoping to Recover and Return to Country to Serve. <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report) Air Force soldiers Huang Changlin, Xu Hanling, and Wei Yitang, who are receiving medical treatment in Hong Kong, accepted a consolation gift of HK$3.00 from nine-year-old Li Baoqiong of the Kowloon Soong Tong School. Details are difficult to record in this newspaper. The three of them were deeply moved by the child’s compassion and dare not accept the money. Therefore, on the occasion of the 7/7 Donation Event, they delivered the $3 to the Amateur Association to donate to the country. Mr. Huang told reporters: On the morning of "July 7", upon hearing patriotic songs and seeing the National Defense Play preformed by the China Traveling Troupe at the Lee Theatre, he was very excited. He recalled that at this time last year, he was protecting Wuhan and gave the Japanese a strong blow. Although our important cities have been temporarily lost, the prospects for victory are absolutely optimistic. The training and growth of the new air force are also rapidly advancing. We look forward to recovering soon and returning to the country to serve the people and fulfill our duties as air force members.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Record of the Grand Gathering of the School of Journalism: Commemorating the Establishment of the Student Association on the Seventh of July Incident <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>"Two years of national crisis!" This profound memory floats in everyone's mind!</p>
<p>The staff and students of the China School of Journalism, organized by the Young Journalists Association, also had this memory stir up waves in their hearts. Facing the difficulties, our Polish friends want to make a solemn statement today. Moreover, they want to engrave a commemorative mark of inheriting arduous work today -- the establishment of the Student Association, specifically held at this moment.</p>
<p>As the evening sea breeze swayed up the mountain, students with vehicle-wheel badges hanging in haste on Kennedy Road, two, three, were streaming towards the School of Journalism.</p>
<p>At 7:13 PM, the singing and fragmented conversations subsided. The students surrounded the President, the Dean of Studies, and the guests as they strode into a brightly lit hall, each taking a seat in a semi-circular, elegant arrangement. This commemorative meeting with profound meaning began.</p>
<p>Initially, an "interlude" was performed: a donation for the Seventh of July Festival was held at this time. A colleague of elegant demeanor held a small box and walked to each person. Thus, gongs, silver coins, copper coins, 30 cents, 50 cents, Hong Kong paper money, and even Guangdong cents, were thrown into the box one after another. This was like soldiers firing bullets at the invaders in unison.</p>
<p>Following that, the chairman struck a solemn tone. "Tonight, we are holding two meetings simultaneously. One is the Seventh of July Commemorative Meeting, and the other is the Inaugural Meeting of the China School of Journalism Student Association. The meaning is: in the growth of the War of Resistance, we must take a fighting posture and greet new work on the journalistic front..."</p>
<p>The emcee, following the chairman's lead, shouted in a short voice, "Instructions!" Then immediately took over the chairman's duties to invite Mr. Huang Zufen to the stage to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang presented valuable work experience as a gift to the students present. Finally, he specifically emphasized, "...In the Student Association, work should be the priority!"</p>
<p>Following that, the chairman walked to the front of the kind old man (the President of the school, Mr. Guo Butao) and respectfully invited him to the stage to give instructions. At this time, all eyes turned to that side, and applause resounded.</p>
<p>The old man, wearing a light silk gown, left his seat, and the whole audience was once again in solemnity. Many people hoped to hear words, which were finally broadcast from his mouth: (1) The work of the Student Association should eliminate the bad concept of "factionalism"; (2) Select new goals on the journalistic front; (3) News practitioners in the War of Resistance should complete their work in suffering; (4) He hopes that everyone can do it, (hands, brain, eyes,) all used together.</p>
<p>From a soaking-wet corner, Mr. Luo Yinpu was invited to the stage. He gave the students a bright warning in a relaxed tone: "The influence of news reporters is very large... Although he can sell his spirit and time, he cannot sell the correct views... If news practitioners do not find ways to acquire knowledge from all aspects and educate themselves, then 'degeneration' is his only future."</p>
<p>The listeners seemed to be eating a rare seafood, their mouths filled with sweetness, but the slight spiciness also stimulated their taste buds. The evening breeze blew in from outside the window, and the air in the hall immediately felt fresher.</p>
<p>The Dean of Studies, Mr. Tan Siwen -- the "nanny" who sees the students every day at the School of Journalism -- cut straight to the chase and spoke frankly, like a cup of sugar water that aids digestion. After the meal, drinking it can relieve phlegm and reduce gas.</p>
<p>Everyone's emotions and excitement converged, and everyone forgot that the time had approached late at night.</p>
<p>The students, very innocent, one after another, with light and agile steps, went to the podium to express their feelings. From their simple and solid words, it was known that they had developed the idea of ​​starting new work on the journalistic front--</p>
<p>At the meeting, after listening to the sincere teachers and students' words, and seeing the joyful and colorful situation, you will always be convinced that this new army that has not yet been forged will present a new posture on the journalistic front in the future.</p>

All kinds of teaching materials are closely tailored to the needs of the environment, with particular emphasis on English. Graduates who enter the University of Hong Kong have a good foundation.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Total Mobilization of Drama Workers Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Chan</p>
<p>China Salvation, China Art, and various youth drama groups are staging performances one after another</p>
<p>Drama workers are always on the front lines of the cultural position: in this great coming of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction, they are welcoming this sacred festival with the most enthusiastic continuation and the fighting experience!</p>
<p>Recently, the drama movement in Hong Kong has been developing vigorously in a white-hot situation. "China Salvation," "Chongzu," and "China Art," several major drama groups, are constantly performing, and small drama groups are also working undercover. In fact, the popular mass drama movement has its self-growth and development, widely and deeply loved and needed by the mass groups. In the midst of the "July 7th" second anniversary, it has undoubtedly become an important work topic for them. Originally, the "Hong Kong Youth Festival Drama Association" should have been in unified order, but due to the recent changes in objective rules and the limitations of material conditions, this relatively large-scale work was restricted. Therefore, each community has to use the method of scattered lines of combat to individually strive for more favorable work opportunities.</p>
<p>In the past few days, no matter in which corner or occasion, there have been enthusiastic, excited, and determined lines of work by our young drama partners, each contributing the greatest enthusiasm and spirit to commemorate this great day.</p>
<p>According to our ability to know, the following performances are available:</p>
<p>"China Salvation" performed the heroic and magnificent historical drama of the War of Resistance "The Light of Southern Shandong" in Chongqing from the 6th as a farewell performance after the forging, to commemorate the great festival of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction, and held two performances on the day and night of "July 7th" with the play "Beside the Wuding River", which is a re-enactment of the history of the Lugou Bridge, and used all the income as a charity performance for the donation movement. On the 8th, "The Light of Southern Shandong" was still performed. For three consecutive days, students and the general public in Hong Kong were entertained with the lowest ticket prices as a farewell memorial. The exquisite and magnificent performance, the enthusiastic and tense emotions of the audience, and the last few performances have received extremely satisfactory harvests.</p>
<p>China Art performed "Dawn" at the Central Theatre at 9:30 am on "July 7th". This was performed by the Hong Kong Branch of the Young Journalists Association, the Chinese Literary Association, and the joint China Art to commemorate the second anniversary of "July 7th".</p>
<p>The Drama Group of the South China Athletic Association performed "March of the Motherland" at the Confucius Hall, which included three related one-act plays directed by Deng Zhongxiu.</p>
<p>The Youth Amusement Club is a reputable youth salvation organization in Kowloon. From July 5th to 7th, every night, women and children were divided into three groups to hold a July 7th memorial, performing one-act plays such as "Women Under the Iron Heel," "Bangzi Opera," and "Submissive People."</p>
<p>The Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Education Service Group is organized by progressive knowledgeable women and female workers from various factories in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon. On the nights of the 6th and 7th, they jointly held an enlarged July 7th memorial with Qiaoguang Society and Xué Dé Lizhì Society, performing plays such as "Women Under the Iron Heel," "Other Bitter Women," and "Honor Brigade."</p>
<p>The Ziqiang Sports Association, a hardworking community in the Hung Hom district, was invited by all walks of life in Hung Hom to the July 7th Second Anniversary Memorial on the 7th to perform "Blood-Soaked Lugou Bridge" and "The Last Resort."</p>
<p>The New Star Society, an organization of factory workers in Kowloon, has been extremely diligent in the drama movement. The July 7th memorial was also held last night, performing "The Last Resort" and "Zhangjiadian," directed by Ling Si and Hu Ruihua.</p>
<p>The Red Red Singing Team is a new organization of students from the High School Affiliated to Guangzhou University, and a drama team has been established at the same time. Starting from the 7th, they will go to Tsuen Wan and the creation of rural propaganda for four consecutive days. In addition to singing and speeches, they will also perform "Three Rivers Good" and "After the Fall."</p>
<p>The Whirlwind Drama Club is an amateur drama group of workers in Sham Shui Po. On the morning of the 7th, at the invitation of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Refugee Free School, it performed "Can't Return Home" at the North River Theatre, and the "Save a Bullet" by the Alumni Association of Zhiyong Primary School and the "Study to Save the Country" by Huanan School were also performed.</p>
<p>The Huiyang Youth Association held a moonlit gathering at the swimming pool in a corner of their own site in Lizhi on the evening of the 5th, attended by more than 400 members and friends, with extremely enthusiastic emotions. A July 7th memorial was held on the evening of the 7th, performing plays such as "Zhangjiadian," and there were singing and speeches.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned information that is known to the ability of seven, there are naturally more partners who are working in a tense and enthusiastic manner without being noticed. I believe that this general report has made people quite surprised. I never thought that young drama workers are so calm and hardworking to commemorate this great day, ah.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, drama workers have stood on the cultural position with an attitude full of movement and combativeness, and have been the most outstanding combatants. In the midst of this second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction, people feel that their power is vast and immortal.</p>
<p>May our drama work meet the beginning of the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction with stronger and more tenacious struggles!</p>
<h3 id="e80">A Glorious Page of Enlightenment! <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>The old hatred is now to be repaid!</p>
<p>It was late at night when I returned home from Hong Kong. The banana trees planted by my father were growing vigorously, swaying in the moonlight. Weary and with thoughts surging, I strolled in the courtyard, and the night wind blew my messy hair.</p>
<p>I felt infinite emotion, and also infinite excitement. The beginning of the great national self-defense war, the re-enactment of history, the historical drama "Beside the Wuding River" composed of sad and angry emotions, this historical drama, like the afterglow after a knot was untied, gave me an unforgettable performance by "China Salvation"! "Beside the Wuding River" (Protecting Lugou Bridge), this three-act collectively created historical drama, was actually able to be performed happily and completely in this place on the evening of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. Although this performance has already been ××××××××× but the more it feels like a hard-won and unyielding struggle ××××××, the more it makes people feel infinitely emotional, and also infinitely excited!</p>
<p>The performance of the play is certainly worthy of our great admiration, for fighting for a national independence. The inherent freedom of the unyielding action, the spirit of not shrinking. "China Salvation" has given millions of Hong Kong overseas Chinese children a noble national character!</p>
<p>We who work in the drama position often encounter countless unfortunate and unexpected experiences. At that time, how frustrated we were. How to borrow with pain, more remotely think of the great difficulties suffered by the partners fighting in the dark "isolated island", sometimes I can't help but shed tears for the freedom of our nation! But I know that in order to fight for the emancipation of the people, eternal freedom, and the rebirth of the future motherland, we have endured everything, we work with concentration!</p>
<p>Therefore, "China Salvation" can be unyielding and unyielding in several difficulties, and not grow or shrink to fight for the freedom of ××××××××× is unforgettable!</p>
<p>It also deeply leads me to a profound idea: making me more firmly believe that the national self-defense struggle of the motherland is a river of storms and waves, but as long as we use greater patience and greater struggle, we will cross to the shore of victory?</p>
<p>"China Salvation" wrote a page with a glorious enlightenment for our drama movement on the evening of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction!</p>
<p>Two years ago, the joyful cannons of the great battle were remotely transmitted from the Lugou Bridge to the ancient revolutionary region in the south, shaking the entire ancient city with excitement, grief, and fierce emotions.</p>
<p>In mid-August, we finished reading a book with crazy enthusiasm that will forever leave a groundbreaking record in the Chinese drama world, "Protecting Lugou Bridge" {Immediately, all the drama workers in Guangzhou, including the old and young partners, started rehearsing under the call of the "Guangdong Drama Association."</p>
<p>Unforgettable, in the Girls' Christian Association with trees and ground grass, we started our first opportunity, hundreds of young men and women happily assigned roles in that small auditorium, starting the division of groups to confront words, after that, everyone was divided into groups and rehearsed in different places, each partner was working with such enthusiasm and excitement, everyone was hoping for a great performance ah!</p>
<p>On August 23rd, the iron turtle with the sign of the sun began to start in the ruins of the ancient city in the south. Our anti-aircraft gunners also began their first reform and heroic shooting! The iron war was known to be cruel and merciless, and it fell pitifully on our land. However, from that morning, this ancient city has been endlessly subjected to ××××××××× people were completely trapped in a restless day of panic and running. It is pitiful that life is all about cherishing life and running away everywhere. We are young people, we are the active heart of this city, we are not afraid, we are not afraid, we laugh and jump in the air raids, and each group of plays is still rehearsing.</p>
<p>At that time, the lights had already started to be controlled, and we took the tired and excited mood from the theatre, stepping on the road without street lights, talking and laughing loudly, sometimes when we saw ignorant citizens opening a little sea fire light from the door, we used the old voice to pretend to be the police and shouted loudly, sometimes we even bumped the worn wooden door heavily with our leather boots, and the light inside quietly went out.</p>
<p>In this way, we had a proud, indulgent, and full of cheerful laughter.</p>
<p>However, the ancient city gradually became empty, and people dispersed to their hometowns. We who stayed in the city began to feel that work had no home, and it was indeed impossible to continue our work. This frequent alarm made people sigh in vain.</p>
<p>After more than twenty days of exciting work, we were forced to stop, we sighed, but more resentment, this battle had no way to perform in this city, but this city was trampled under the hooves of the barbarians!</p>
<p>Now, it's been two years, and the memories are rekindled in my heart, deeply feeling infinite Zhang Chou and infinite sadness; but the performance of China Salvation gives me a great excitement and joy, and completely washes away all my cowardly emotions - I believe it will also wash away the same emotions of many people.</p>
<p>I remember that at that time, I had agreed to an article, "Remember angrily, who made us lose the freedom to perform?..."</p>
<p>But, now, we are using a new struggle to repay our old hatred!</p>
<p>Late night of the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident</p>

<p>—A new, satisfying and successful attempt—</p>
<p>With my stubborn nature as an outsider, since I fled to Hong Kong a year ago, I have never had much affection for Cantonese-performed dramas. Of course, half of the reason is because I can't understand the language, and also because I have never found any dramas performed in the local dialect in other places, so I feel even more unpleasant to hear.</p>
<p>In fact, because of the particularity of the language in Guangdong, there has been Cantonese drama for a long time, which is an inevitable trend, because the greatest requirement of drama is actually to win a large number of audiences. What should be noted is not to cater to the audience and accommodate the audience's low tastes, but to slowly try to improve their interest and lead them to a high level of appreciation. Drama itself is definitely not just entertainment, but contains profound educational significance.</p>
<p>So the problem now is no longer the problem of the dialect of the performance, but is completely rooted in a kind of consciousness, attitude, and the form of the performance. If it distorts the current reality and avoids the trend of the times, even if it has a high degree of mature skill, it will inevitably tend to decline and annihilation.</p>
<p>When "China Art" established a Cantonese group, I was really worried at the time; perhaps it was because most of the Cantonese films gave people a deep aversion, and at that time, I only vaguely knew that the members of the Cantonese group were all engaged in film and television. But then I slowly changed my views and understood that the comrades of the "Cantonese Group" also deeply hated "folk tales" and "wooden fish books", and several artists who had a long history in the film industry before were unwilling to mix in the unconscious environment and resolutely withdrew from the film industry; this time, for the love of drama, and in the hope of obtaining accurate artistic cultivation, they gathered under the banner of "China Art", working hard and painstakingly.</p>
<p>In fact, we cannot erase the current efforts and corrections because of past mistakes. If we can use the actual working spirit and the effect of the performance to give those "artists" who are indulging in the muddy waters a serious stimulus and blow, and shake their turbid concepts, then I think such work, although difficult, has a rather significant meaning: what we are aiming at now is the facts, not the mission of clarifying the workers that can be accomplished by empty shouts, is a practical problem, and after China Art formed a Cantonese group with Peng Ren as the unit, it is even more worthy of serious discussion;</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hu Chunbing's opinion is also worth remembering deeply regarding the problem of Peng Ren's interpretation of historical drama. He provided many valuable opinions that I shared, the main ones being the danger of vulgarization and the bad habits of the star system. Regarding these two problems, they are very likely to occur in commercial society, or even unconsciously go on this dangerous road. I remember that in Shanghai after "August 13th", there was once an organization called "Film Actors' Troupe", which set off to the cities in the rear. This was also a professional drama troupe organization. Although I don't quite understand the details, there is no doubt that they fell into the above crisis, and finally unfortunately disintegrated. This is a lesson for every drama worker, to understand that business is only temporary, and the spirit of art is eternal.</p>
<p>On the night of the "Tears Sprinkled on Flowers" drama performance, I can be said to be the most excited and concerned audience, because I watched it slowly grow under the joint work of dreamers. I felt an unspeakable intimacy, and during the performance, although I could only understand most of the words, each actor attracted the audience with considerable and skilled acting skills, all the way to the satisfactory closing. This was a new and pioneering attempt. But I am glad that they have begun to rush towards the road to success.</p>
<p>Many people must have felt this was an unexpected harvest, a group of film actors were able to have such a considerable success in the attempt, and this performance has even greater significance. Because this is the medium of South China drama and film. The performance of "Tears Sprinkled" is not only a good harvest in the performance, but it has also further done a practical cleaning work, reminding the demise of those scoundrels who eat film and drama meals; this is a very good new force! If this force can be rigorously promoted, it will contain a new influence on the film and drama circles in South China?</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Radiance of a New Beginning! The South China Film Industry Swearing-in Ceremony: "July 7th" Marked by Outrageous Acts Amidst Solemn Tension <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The South China film industry held a grand National Spiritual Mobilization swearing-in ceremony at the Lee Theatre the day before yesterday, commemorating the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. This gathering of the South China film industry was the first of its kind, especially commendable as the oath was taken "as a gift" to commemorate "July 7th."</p>
<p>Those attending this time included Ouyang Yuqian, Luo Jingyu, Cai Chusheng, Tan Youliu, Su Yi, Xue Juexian, Wu Chufan, Li Qinian, Huang Yaoli, and several hundred others. At precisely 9:00 AM, after the ceremony preparations were completed, Chairman Ouyang Yuqian delivered a speech. The most important point was: the × people in Eastern China, North China, and Shanghai are actively promoting their so-called "national policy films," attempting to bewitch our ignorant compatriots with this toxic movement. There is also the possibility of it spreading to South China. Our film industry should, under the banner of the War of Resistance and National Construction, exert the great power of film to give the aggressors a stern response.</p>
<p>After Xu Shiying, the acting chairman of the Central Relief Committee, delivered a speech on behalf of Lin Boqu, Cai Chusheng solemnly and earnestly said: The relationship between spiritual mobilization and film workers is very close. Overcoming the life of revelry and complacency, and seeking only temporary comfort, as outlined in the spiritual mobilization program, is tantamount to a life-saving drama for the film industry. From now on, film workers must use the spirit of perseverance to overcome material difficulties, so that the essence of their works is not only entertainment, but also spiritual food, not spiritual poison.</p>
<p>Following this, the leaders and giants of the South China film industry delivered speeches, successively revealing the truth and deeply moving audiences with their warnings. This can be said to be an unprecedented awakening of the South China film industry, and the radiance of a new beginning for the South China film industry.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Radiance of Victory <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>My three-month stay in Hong Kong has passed quickly.</p>
<p>When we first raised funds for the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Association and held a welcoming performance, the enthusiasm of the compatriots in Hong Kong was something we will never forget. This inspiration was no different from what we felt on the battlefield. We will take their ardent expectations as encouragement and impetus in our future work.</p>
<p>We deeply understand that the enthusiasm and love of audiences everywhere for us stems from our shared goals. Our work is the work that hundreds of thousands of audience members need.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, two years have passed. In our country, during these two years, countless compatriots have suffered unprecedented pain in history, while countless outstanding sons and daughters of China have built a Great Wall of steel on our land with their blood and flesh, with the greatest sacrifice and selfless spirit. Two years ago, on "July 7th," the water of the Yongding River was reddened. However, the entire Chinese nation used this as an opportunity to straighten its back, stand up, and settle scores with the × people who have been bullying us for many years. This debt will undoubtedly be paid off in the near future!</p>
<p>Our country has spent two years in a bitter struggle. The facts tell us that the glorious sacrifices of millions of people, the Great Wall of steel built with flesh and blood, has laid a bright and free foundation for our motherland, and has revealed a ray of truth to the world. Our Chinese nation will never perish. Our Chinese descendants will never fall into eternal doom under the shameless and despicable guise of "peace." We must fight to the end! Our camp is clear: the sons and daughters of China must unite even more closely and strive for our final victory as quickly as possible. Let those historical Qin Huis die; we need not care about them at all!</p>
<p>The water of the Yongding River still flows babblingly under the Lugou Bridge. Today, two years later, we remember "July 7th" even more deeply. We cannot forget the brothers who sacrificed on the Yongding River, and we cannot forget the millions of our most beloved fighters who are fighting day and night on the homeland, in the sky, on the battlefield, persevering and fighting desperately with the × people. They have demonstrated the national soul of the Chinese nation. We are their brothers and sisters. For ourselves, for future generations, and for our country, we must strengthen our vigilance and struggle. Contribute money if we have it, and contribute strength if we have it. The radiance of victory is getting closer to us.</p>
<p>We are about to leave Hong Kong and move farther and farther away from the motherland. But our hearts are getting closer to the motherland. When we gather with you again in a year, perhaps it will be in Guangzhou, Nanjing, or Shanghai. At that time, we will be performing plays about national construction after victory. - Let us encourage each other!</p>
