<h3 id="c1">關於西南少數民族的立法問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 丁裕長</p>
<p>凡是到過我國西部邊彊遊歷或曾涉獵邊疆史地的人，都知道我國民族。除了漢，滿，蒙，囘，藏五族以外，還有許多少數民族分佈於西部各省區。大略說來，如雲南的玀玀和擺夷，西康的番族，貴州的苗猺，廣西廣東以及湘西的猺撾，海南島的黎族，四川舊建昌道八縣（現隸西康省）的夷族，……合計不下數百萬人，尤以貴州一省爲最，全省人口有『漢四苗六』之語。上述的少數民族，如與新疆甘肅一帶的囘族，西藏靑海的藏埃番族，蒙古的蒙挨，和東三省極邊未漢化的滿族合計，當不下二三千萬人。在我國因漢族人口的龐大，所以比較起來，仍是一個小數目，這些少數民族，據人種學的研究，其血統上和漢族最爲接近。且因歷史上的戰爭和商業的關係，在政治上，經濟上和文化上和漢族有密切關係，可是一方面卻仍保持着他們特有的文化及語言，並未完全漢化。卽以法律而論，歷代法律雖經施行於各省區。繼續保持他的統一性，但對於上述的少數民族，大都視同化外。並未嚴格的實施，卽在今日亦尙如此。</p>
<p>歷代中央政府對于西南少數民族（包括苗，猺，獞，黎，玀　，擺夷等除了持保宗主權以外，任令其統者者理其部埃，除了朝貢和戰爭以外，極少直接的接觸。她們又不如滿族，蒙埃曾入主中夏，統治漢挨，曾於法律上自居于優越地位如金代于法律上規定一種人」，『澳人』及「南人」三階級，元代分「蒙古人」，「色目人」「漢人」及南人四階級，淸代分「旂籍」及「漢人」等階級，以壓迫漢族。隊們的經濟生活，大半滯留于漁獵，遊牧或初期的農業社會。以唯物史觀的見地而論，他們的意識形態，自囿於部落的或封建的範疇，與我們漢埃已進入工商社會者不同。所以我們漢人創立的法律，自難一律適於此等少數民族。自晉末五胡亂華以迄唐，宋，元，明，淸，漢挨不斷以武力征服他們，壓迫他們深入西南山岳地帶。唐代以後，常封其降服的部落首領或征伐有功的將士爲他們的世襲的官吏，建立了士司的制度。土司在其所封建的部落內爲最高唯一的主宰，而一入漢官衙署卽處於最低的地位，這種封建的士司，對於其部屬，有「朕卽法律」之概。在其治下的少數民埃，隨其喜怒，而有生殺予奪之權，中央政府或地方流官絕無顧問之例。以致此種民挨日處於水深火熱之境，時起叛亂。經淸末實行一改土歸流，的政策，逐漸取消封建的土司政治，改組的正規的地方政府，解放此種少數民族；使居於齊民之列。凡是改土歸流的地方，所有少數民族，十九均巳漢化，甚難保持他們的文化。但利了現在，邊疆各地，仍未能完全消滅這種封建的土司政治，卽有名義上已設流官的地方，因當局設施未善，仍形同虛設，實權仍操於舊有土司的後裔，也數見不鮮。所以這些少數民族的身分，在事實上並未與漢族平等，約法上規定中華民國國民一律平等。無男女，種族，宗敎，職業之別，在西南各省，可說並未貫澈，决非過言。</p>
<p>過去西南各省，在政治上積極的爲少數民埃謀解放的首推廣西。而少數民族被漢化最快又最普遍的亦爲廣西。數十年前桂西大部均爲上司統治，今日除了柳江和桂江中間的猺山尙留若干猺族部第以外，已無土司政治的痕跡。雯南省政府則在西部邊彊，分設殖邊督辦公署，施行邊彊的特殊敎育，亦有相當功效。至於西康建省以後，據說對於與漢族素不往來的夷族（處於舊建昌道八縣）也將設局感化。足見抗戰以後，因政治重心移至西部高原，中央對於少數民族解放工作，正積極推進。</p>
<p>我們固然應將處於封建士司壓迫下的小數民挨解放，使其與漢族在法律上及事實上處於平等地位，但我們應否使他們消滅固有的文字言語而澈底漢化，却是一個可以商榷的問題。對於西南少數民族的立法，原則上自應根據孫先生的遺敎，而在技術方面，我們希望政府對於下列各點，加以考慮：</p>
<p>第一，中央及地方立法機關，似應有各少數民的代表參加，使他們對於本埃的特別立法，儘景貢獻意見。</p>
<p>第二，法律上應確認少數民族的文字和語言的效力，對於漢字含有侮辱或輕視的民族名稱，應禁止使用，以融和民族的情感。</p>
<p>第三，少數民挨集居的區域，似應各劃爲與漢埃不同的『法域』。現行的民刑商法，應各視其經濟生活及文化水準並顧及其固有的善良風俗，酌定施行的範圍。或竟另訂單行法規，俾有實施的可能。</p>
<p>第四，土司制度自須廢除。對於少數民唉的生產建設，敎育文化，必須特別立法，助其發展。</p>
<p>我們相信，根據孫先生遺敎的立法，必爲西南少數民族解放的開始。</p>
<h3 id="c2">世界動向一週間 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 公昭</p>
<p>從廿八年六月十八日至廿四日</p>
<p>（一）首鼠兩端，英法××××堅持立場，蘇聯威信大孕</p>
<p>英法政府，還徬徨在　路。爲了他們本國人民與世界和平，他們不能不走上反侵略的大路，但統治階層本身目前的利益，却阻止了他們應有的遠大的視綫，而且頑固地害怕侵略者僞造以恐嚇英法的『布爾什維克的侵略』　！因此，作爲反侵略運動之發端的英蘇談判，還在進兩步退一步的狀態之中。一週來英國特使史德隆在莫斯科繼續進行談判，但因英法所謂新對案，依然距離英法蘇互助協定的基本條件尙遠，所以無甚結果。同時，英法政府却仍在與侵略者私相往來，英德債務協定的附欵，已於本月十六日在倫敦簽字，範圍且將擴至蘇台德區；而法日國與日本的新商約，亦於本月廿三日在東京簽字成立，此外德國的海通社還傳出英法均將向德意統治下的西班牙貸款的消息！</p>
<p>蘇聯現在堅持原來立場，這樣，充分表現社會主的蘇聯，對於任何侵略者沒有妥協浪讓；充分表現蘇聯國力强盛，他是反侵略的柱石、但不願爲人利用而替人蹈火取栗。至於德日侵略者的海通社和同盟社發出消息，說德國正在向蘇獻媚，所以蘇聯熊度反强，這是無恥的謠言，蘇聯固然决不致爲侵略者的陰謀所左右，英法有識之士亦能洞鑒英法蘇互助協定，不容遲遲簽訂了：邱吉爾卽在二十一日發表演說，反對首鼠兩端的政策，促政府早日完成對蘇合作的談判。</p>
<p>（二）野心未戢，德意加强勾德</p>
<p>戰火亂飛，歐亞同受威脅</p>
<p>英法等民主和平國家首鼠兩端的政策，直接間接都幫助了侵略國家，也就是增進了世界大戰的危機，首先受害的除了弱小民族以外，就是英法兩國本身。</p>
<p>這一週，德意兩國有了更進一步的勾結，第一，德意兩國將派員於本月十九日在柏林會談，使兩國經濟更趨密切合作的事項，不久卽可成立詳細條文，並决定兩國與波希米亞及摩拉維亞的商務關係。第二，德意兩國經數日會商結果，已於本月二十日成立有關兩國海軍合作的協定。同時，德意兩國又分別舉行海軍演習，德國演習於十六日開始，意國則於十九日開始在地中海示威兩星期。</p>
<p>這一週，德國的軍事活動與外交活動也在加緊進行。在軍事方面，德國大軍十萬繼續東調，集中於斯洛伐克及彼蘭邊境。在外交方面，除了一面亂造謠言，破壞英蘇談判以外，還繼續爭取歐亞兩洲的小國：德國陸軍參謀長已經確定報聘愛沙尼亞及芬蘭兩國，德國對近東各國尤其是對阿拉伯的誘脅，在本週尤爲着力，已在進行以飛機交換煤油權的談判了。</p>
<p>德意侵略者的戰火，快要和亞東的日本××的烽火銜接起來了！</p>
<p>（三）息事甯人？英　律案退讓仗義執言，蘇美對日抗議</p>
<p>東方××日本侵略者，針對着英法首鼠兩端的政策，亦卽採取進一步嚇詐的計策，而封鎖天津事件便是最引世人注目的一著。誠如本月十八日英國海軍上將基可斯演講所說：『天津事件，日本獲得德意兩國的支持，實際上已等於向英帝國宣戰，此種挑釁行爲，必須加以應付！』</p>
<p>英國政府採取了什麼對策呢？又是兩面政策。英政府一面於十六日對日×封鎖天津租界事件，發表重要宣言，說：『英政府不得不考慮一切迅速積極的步驟，以保護英國在華之利益』，但一面則在同一宣言中又稱：『英政府現仍希望日當局不至堅持其拒絕考慮英方建議之主張，俾此事件，由地方局部解决！」</p>
<p>但是，日×封鎖英租界，誠如英國宣言中所稱：『顯在以暴力强迫英政府及其他在遠東有利益關係之國家，放棄其過去之一貫政策』這又那裏能够「地方局部解决」呢？英國這種退讓政策，除了增加英國在遠東權益所受威脅以外，會有什麼結果呢？</p>
<p>蘇聯對於此事，雖然『與己無關』，但是全國報章，巳先後發表評論，痛斥日×的暴行，號召民主和平國家共起加以制裁。蘇聯政府，並以日方慫恿白俄强佔天津蘇聯總領署，而於十八日首先向日方嚴提抗議。</p>
<p>美國，雖然由日×暗送秋波，而實際上日×勢力的發展，同時就是對美的威脅，因此對於津案，始終嚴密注意，不過英國未有斷然反抗行為，美國就亦沒有重大的表現，不過無論美國人民及政府，都已先後指斥日×，並表示願與英法合作。美國務卿赫爾並於十九日正式表示關切天津「廣泛局勢」，而美駐東京代辦，亦曾一再對日提出抗議。</p>
<p>（四）忍無可忍，英謀對日報復先發制人，日×突佔汕頭</p>
<p>蘇聯，美國和我國當局，對日×封鎖天津界事件，先後表示義慣，並指出祗有合力反斷，才能獲得勝利。</p>
<p>這種表現和指示，英法本國人民與多數政界人士的要求，互相配合，確曾給於英國以重大的影響，據十七，八兩日路透社倫教電訊，英國商財外三部，巳經認淸對日忍無可忍，决定報復辦法，（一）取消日本原享之最惠國待遇，（二）廢棄一九一一年英日條約，使日本喪失其在英國各殖民地的大好市場，</p>
<p>（三）對進口日貨一律加懲重稅。</p>
<p>這種報復辦法，如果見諸實施，對於正苦於經濟崩潰的日本，自是嚴重的打擊。日×在這時，認爲『先下手爲强』，而仙頭是目前英國和我國唯一的通商口岸，便突然於廿一日在汕頭登陸，給英國在華南商業以最後的打擊。廿三日我軍委會發言人亦指出日×佔　汕頭，所謂斷絕我軍器輸入，僅爲自欺欺人之談，目的在於驅逐歐美在華勢力，獨覇我沿海口岸，建立所謂『東亞新秩序』。</p>
<p>由此可知日×此次侵佔汕頭，還是繼承今春侵佔海南島，斯巴特島，鼓浪嶼和上海天津租界一貫的作風的，我們從這裏看到『地方局　解决』和一切妥協退讓，不能解决遠東問題，慕尼黑故技亦不能適用於遠東，而日×勢力的發曼是無可解救的必然要增進它與歐美列强的衝突，英國要保持遠東權益，就只有加緊與中美法蘇台作！</p>
<p>（五）滅此朝食，汕×遭我痛擊磁×陰謀，全國政治進步</p>
<p>日×侵佔汕頭，除了主要的威脅英國之外，當然還有其經濟上政治上和軍事上的相當意義。還是我們不用諱言尤其是不應忽視的。第一，日×鑒於侵華軍事的屢遭敗績，國內對於侵華政策的紛爭及反戰怒潮高漲，便把早在掌握中的仙頭宣佈佔領，作爲南昌以後的大捷報，以掩飾其軍事上的日趨退步。第二，日×還想藉此動搖我國抗戰决心，帮助汪精銜及其黨徒動搖份子頑固份子，以便分化抗戰陣綫建立僞中央政權的活動。第三，在經濟上一面藉以阻止我國內地貸物輸出，加强對我外匯與法幣的破壞，一面阻制我東南各省×後游擊戰鬥的經濟路綫。今後對浙閩粵沿海，必有進一步的騷擾。此外，當然還有牽制我粵北贛南兵力，以加强其鞏固東南佔領區的企圖。</p>
<p>然我們潮汕的守軍，巳經奮起抵抗了！我們不僅要用『滅此朝食』的精神，『不准×人前進』我們還要從政治上經濟上和國際關係上予×以無情的嚴重的打擊，這一週來，儘管×人，漢奸，汪精衞等妖言惑衆，但是一週來新的事實，如海外各地僑胞團體及個人，各路前綫將士，擁獲中央政府嚴緝漢奸汪精衛的通電，速日紛飛重慶；又如成吉思汁陵寢南移，蒙族熱誠表現擁護中央持久抗日，爭取民族解放，又如上海奧論界堅决擁護中央及全國團結，和汪精衞等和平反共救國的言論及恐怖行動作堅韌的鬥爭；又如我財部於廿二日採取緊急措置　防止黄金逃避及投機，穩定調市金融，助畏內地生產；尤其是中央軍委會通令全國文武官員，切實遵重民意民命；這些事實都足以打擊目前日×政治進攻及以戰養戰的陰謀，而國際形勢亦益加對我有利了。</p>
<p>（六）遠東聯防，星島會議開幕與子同仇，英法美荷合作</p>
<p>國際形勢怎樣日趨於我有利　？在本週可以列舉：（一）國際勞工局長廿二日發表演說同情我國工人，加緊統一戰綫抵抗日×，呼籲世界人士設法救濟，（二）反侵略大會英國總會廿三日通過决議，促政府獨自立卽採取外交及濟經上行動以制止日本侵略行爲。此外，尤其値得注意的，是英法兩國遠東軍事當局，巳於廿二日在新加坡舉行遠東聯防會議，據傳這次會議，可能成立如下協定（一）設置遠東英法聯軍中央統帥部，（二）集中兩國之戰時原料，（三）草擬一旦與日本交戰的軍事計劃，（四）兩國共同努力將法屬法南之甘蘭灣造成法國之新加坡，（五）共同保護中國英法租界之措施，（六）保護遠東英法商輪之步驟，（七）保障與暹羅，荷屬東印度美國多處交通綫之步驟。此外又傳英法對美荷兩國，將進商合作保障遠東權益與眞正和平。</p>
<p>我們要在這裏指出，日×勢力發展，與英法荷各國的矛盾亦必隨之發展。時至今日，則已進入直接衝突的階段，尤其自去年五月×佔厦鬥十月×佔廣州以後，　以今年二月×佔海南島，三月底×佔斯巴特萊島，五月侵入鼓浪嶼，以至最近之封鎖天津租界和强佔汕頭市，都可證期日×已在開始大規模的進攻英法，企圖驅遂歐美在遠東勢力了！英法美荷在今日，唯一生路，便只有切實合作，援助中國取得抗日勝利，並且採取合作反抗日×的直接行動，新加坡會議，應該是民主和平國家糾織遠東反侵略路綫的發端　！</p>
<p>注意：關於中蘇中法新約法土協定，新巴爾幹聯防公約，英法遠東聯防，英美物物交的協定等，因篇幅及時間關係，未及盡述，請閱今日小許『中蘇中法新約』一文及朋日本報社評『中蘇中法新約與國際反侵略的高潮』一文。</p>

<p>— 民革社記者　林煥平</p>
<p>（民革社通訊稿）我們——引導人閻君和記者，走到一間陳舊的老百姓的窰洞門前，記者聽到閻君說：『這就是閻先生的「公館」。』記者倒吃驚這『公館』的平凡了。</p>
<p>遞過片子，進了門口，閻先生連忙站起來，介紹過後，就向記者握手請坐，微笑着說：</p>
<p>『辛苦了，這裏氣候，生活習慣都不同，你還過得慣嗎？』</p>
<p>待人的慈祥，和對年靑人的關切，呈露在他臉部耀人的光彩上。</p>
<p>記者感到十分惶恐，忙答道：</p>
<p>『承司令長官厚德，非常感謝，』</p>
<p>『閻先生衣灰料布中山裝，沒有掛橫直皮帶，沒有扣領章，更沒有扣肩章，穿布鞋，軍帽擱在矮桌上，只戴着一頂睡覺或壓髮用的黑布帽，窰洞極爲簡單，沒有窻，一個土坑，舖着氈子，氈子上，再鋪着一張被褥于，摺疊着兩張棉被，一張尺把高的小矮桌子，子上放着一個墨盒，一枝毛筆，一摺信箋，兩條長板凳，擺在坑前，兩個小箱子，擱在洞的深處，此外，便什麼都沒有了。誰能想像這就是閻司令長官和他居住的『公館』辦公室，會客室兼臥室呢？</p>
<p>『你從後方，不，從國外來，華僑的抗戰動態怎樣呢？』</p>
<p>記者訪問閻先生，是爲了想多知道點前線英勇抗戰的事實。如今反被他問到後方的事來了，可知道他對後方的關切，更可知道在前線奮鬥的民挨英雄們，在消息隔絕的狀態下，是如何望着知道後方的一切，記者給他簡單的叙述過後，就反問道：</p>
<p>『關於現階段華北抗戰，司令長官有甚麼感想嗎？』</p>
<p>『華北，×人是絕對沒有辦法拿去的。』老將軍坐正身子，左手臂靠在桌子上，說道：『華北旣拿不掉，則×人亡　的夢想，永沒有達成的可能。』他停一下，喝口茶，體態怡然地繼續下去：『實在說，×人侵我，不單純的是政略與戰略指揮下的侵略戰爭，又沒有不覆敗的！』</p>
<p>閻先生平日沉思默慮，出語多成格言；在哲學上，有以母理子理爲思維範疇中心思想的『中的哲學』，在經濟上，有『物產證券與按勞分配』的學說之創見，故先生談話有儒者風度，語極簡練；有軍家氣概，詞甚堅决。</p>
<p>我們會談時，恰是讀過蔣委員長四月十七日發表的談話，聲明我們抗戰到底的基本國策之堅决性，我們的話題，便很自然的轉到了這上面去，他擦擦手掌，目光炯炯地望着記者說道：</p>
<p>「抗戰是手段，建國是目的。和平妥協，那怕是日本無條件的撤兵，恢復七七事變前的狀態，我建國事業，都將陷于絕望！因爲我國二千年大一統（指自秦朝至淸末封建統一政治！華者）。把中華民族毒害成了失了自信心，沒有責任心的廢物。現在感謝×人的犬砲炸彈，把我國人民心理根底裏的劣根性轟的動拍了，然而還沒有根本拔掉！假如戰事一旦和了，則國人又重復過那種苟安生活，我國就永無現代化的希望了，以現在的情勢判斷，抗戰只要冉支持一年，則在我國那種劣根性就將全被剷除了；在×人，也必將崩潰了。我國要精誠團結，集體進步，渡過這一個難關，最後</p>
<p>說到這裏老將軍對×人之仇恨，深刻的表現在眉頭，對抗戰必勝建國必成之信心，光耀在飽滿之臉上，而那臉上之肌肉律動在被太陽風沙晒吹得粗褐之皮膚下。更充分表徵着如×人第二次攻陷吉縣時　到×人後方去督戰而艱苦卓絕之無長精神。</p>
<p>閻先生和記者談了一個鐘頭，他是一個健談者，娓娓不倦，記者深恐躭誤他之要公，乃興辭而出，他送至門口，握手話別時，注意到記者衣服既單薄，復無帽子，關切地說：</p>
<p>「你沒有戴帽子嗎？着了凉可不行呀！」</p>
<p>老人之慈愛，使記者感動得無以對。</p>
<h3 id="c15">鋼軍鐵馬進行曲　我現代新軍大演習之一（上） <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>初夏季節。一夜豪雨，把南國的高空洗滌得格外蔚藍，格外透明。曉風飽和着田野閒的淸芬向西流。不知是雨水呢還是露珠，還停留在風化的苔石上，灌木的綠葉上和靑靑的叢草上，晶瑩圓潤、映印着四週的景物。東方，一帶連山，像晨妝初罷的古美人，冲淡而脈脈含情，正背着朝陽，在縱覽着檻外的風光。</p>
<p>縱橫×十里的廣漠的黃土原，經過雨水的流瀉，像颶風過後的大戈壁，波狀地起伏着。這裏那裏，半身高的松樹，散落地攤着一幅它自己的纖影，在黃土上搖曳着。沒有村舍，沒有農田，沒有　人……。假如不是在一座小山岡的上空飄着一縷炊烟，做了生命的記號，這裏眞可說是一個人跡罕到的地方。</p>
<p>從這黃士原的南緣的亂雜的小山襄，昇起一顆紅色的信號彈，像一團火球，劃過澄靜的碧空，然後拖着一條彗星似的光尾落下地去。——中國現代化新軍開始了它的空前的大演習：步，騎，砲，工，輜，通信，機械化，化學……各兵種，一齊動作。</p>
<p>依照想定，南軍□□師以最大的决心，由□□方面將口口鎭的北軍重要據點施行拂曉攻擊，代表着重砲的破壞射擊的鉅銃，在南軍的陣後爆發了，矯健的步兵在僞裝下露出他們紅紫色的面部，愉快而緊張地，一個個，一班班地從樹林裏，死角下，掩蔽部裏跑出來，像一座龐大的機器的一個輪齒，同時也是一個齒輪，密切地聯繫若，强力地推動着。他們在重砲的掩護下，全綫向北挺進機關槍手較平時多帶了幾串爆竹。迫擊砲手較平時多帶了一口火油箱。狙擊兵較平時多帶了一木枝槍，步槍子彈換上了木質彈頭。</p>
<p>北軍警戒陣地的前哨完全隱蔽。在有利地形或地物的背後，深深地掘好散兵壕。一叢亂草或一株矮松裏。往往就伸着一個圓黑的槍口。對於當前的那些「移動着的草木」，他們用冷眼瞧着，像一頭專心在捕鼠的貓一樣，努力地不把自己的地位給對方知道，描得準準的，然後「砰」的一槍。彈殻從槍膛裏跳出來。便起放進自己的口袋裏去。這是第二期抗戰以來的士兵們的習慣，他們愛惜一顆彈殻就　愛惜一顆子彈</p>
<p>當北軍的機關槍手發現有利的目標時，三發五發的爆竹就放出了淸　的響聲，同時北軍的機關槍也做了南軍「火油箱」的目標，降隆一地裏擊着。</p>
<p>北軍的警戒哨挨不住南軍的熾旺火力的壓迫，開始由兩翼退囘，一面仍節節抵抗，以阻滯雨軍的進展，就像一個小高地的爭奪。亦必經過相當時間的僵持、但最後，側背的攻擊，終於使守軍被迫轉進。</p>
<p>日未落、南軍機械化騎兵——三輪機器腳踏車由陣後出動搜索，有協同　兵，一舉肅淸北軍前進陣地，接近北軍主陣地帶的企圖。駕駛兵們像一匹久經訓練的戰馬一樣，載着輕重機關槍飄忽地穿越過沐叢山隈，滾起一陣濃厚的塵霧。他們迅速地攻擊，迅速地移動、在步兵的協同下，使北軍不得不於黃昏前被迫全部退入主陣地。以□□□高地作　支撑點，控制全局，决定以持久防禦戰術守禦□□□鎭，久困南軍</p>
<p>入晚，月出於山之上。淸風徐來，滌盡了戰場上的火藥氣，兩軍官兵、　經一日之戰鬥，精神仍極旺盛。月光下，北軍由□□□高地俯瞰南軍陣地，依稀可辨。疏落的步槍聲做了相互嚴密警戒的信號。　（未完）大演習後記者中立西服者與某排戰士合紀攝留念</p>

<p>最後，我們必須認淸國際的增進，完全是我們兩年來內部團結統一與堅持抗戰的結果，尤其是最近對於××××汪精衛的嚴厲懲辦，更增加了我政府與人民在國際的威信，我們必須善保此光榮，以求國際地位更加提高，最後勝利早日到來！</p>

<p>— 董平</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>我們很容氣的承認，在世界的政治舞台上，大英帝國是一位老大哥，是一位領導者。過去幾世紀。是如此，近世幾十年，仍然是如此。</p>
<p>不過，同樣地，我們也不能否認，在最近幾年來，所表現的事實，英國却似乎在自動地放棄她的領導權。就拿張伯倫先生豋台以後來說吧，兩年了，英國的一切行動，都似乎是消極的應付，而沒有積極的建設。不干涉西班牙內戰；承認佛郞哥政府，簽訂慕尼黑協定，撤廢駐奧與駐捷公使……都是一種被迫而行的動作。</p>
<p>而在中日戰爭方面，更見不到什麽主動的措置；英大使被擊，英生命財產的傷害，也都不了而了。近日來的天津事件，英國消極的應付政策，更發展到了頂點。</p>
<p>所唯一可以視爲比較積極的，便是英蘇談判。這個談判，原也是在希特勒的炮口下所逼着產生的；不過，如果這個談判，能眞正的吿成，則在安定世界大計上，確是一個積極而又主動的步驟。但是，日月如梭，三月於茲，雙方觀念，仍然未能一致。</p>
<p>英蘇雙方的意見，均未有完全明確的發表；但，我們已經在一般的情報上看出：蘇聯的主張，是積極的，斷然的，而且主動的。由於地理環境及軍事技術的原因——請參閱過去三日來本版特稿—蘇聯這種主張是合理化的。但是，英國爲什麽不能予以遷就呢？這就是邱吉爾所謂的「半截政策」。</p>
<p>張伯倫先生爲什麽總念念不忘於「半截政策」呢？這里是一部份的解答。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>在研究「半截政策」的來源之先，我們應當明白影響張伯　政策的三個因素：傳統的英國政策，今日的英國輿論，及包圍在張伯倫週這的人的動向。</p>
<p>英國的傳統政策，最簡單而明白，是基於三點：第一，維護大英帝國的旣得利益。第二，維持世界均勢與現狀。第三，不歡喜蘇聯。這種建立在極端資本主義上的英國政策，是英國每屆內閣，每個首相，所常常恪守的；張伯倫自也不是例外。它的要點，便是保守；不進，不退，不左，不右。</p>
<p>英國今日的輿論。顯然已與　的傳統政策有了不同。最顯著的，自然是第三點：英國人民感到了法西斯的威脅，深深悟到不歡喜蘇聯是徒然的，而一致要求政府與蘇聯携手。這輿論的力量，的確是相當大，因此才逼着張伯倫去跟蘇聯『虛與委蛇』了一頓——我們很痛心，用這四個字去說明英蘇談判，但，那確是事實。張伯倫抑揚頓挫的對蘇談判，××××××××××××××××；充其量，也不過是一種與希特勒討價還價的外交戰略。雖然，英國與輿論是在向前推，向左拉，但，張伯倫仍然是不想動的。</p>
<p>一般的說來，英國是個法治的國家。政府是黨治政制；但事實上，是並不盡然的。英國幾個黨的政綱，都非常模糊，因此，叛黨之徒才比比皆是，投機份子乃層出不窮。而眞正的政治路綫，在傳統的常軌與輿論的督促之下，仍然大部是操縱在人的手里。過去是如此，現在是如此，將來還是如此。</p>
<p>因此，要明白張伯倫的政策，就應當看一看他的引線帶路的人。</p>
<p>在表面上見到，有兩派人是影響張伯倫政策的：前進派的前外相艾登，前海相古柏及邱吉爾，與標準死硬派的財相西門。前者是往前推，後者則往後拉。艾登與古柏掛冠引去之後，換上的哈立法克斯是個中庸主義者——最近也逐漸同意了艾登的主張——西門的頑固主張是很走紅的，甚至於在最近內閣討論徵兵法案時，他還是一味反對，以去留相要挾。而在遠東方面，他更是助紂爲虐，作祟多端。</p>
<p>可是，這些大人物，雖然都持有成理，但對于張伯倫。却幷不佔着十分重要的地位。眞正影響於張伯倫政策的，却是那一羣包圍在張伯倫左右，而幷不漏臉的人物——所謂張伯倫的「智囊」。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>張伯倫的「智囊」多如恒河之沙，不可勝計。但他們幷不經常在外面漏臉，甚至於有許多連唐寧街都不常去的。可是，的的確確，張伯倫的政策却是在他們的手中滑來滑去。</p>
<p>「智囊」羣中最重要最著名的，有兩個：現任上議院領袖兼掌璽大臣的倫敦德萊侯爵，與張伯倫的嫂夫人奧斯汀張伯倫夫人、</p>
<p>奧斯汀張伯倫是張伯倫一門父子三傑之一曾歷任英國財相，是個理財的專家，在前年才去世。但他的未亡入，却是偶外交能手。</p>
<p>張伯倫夫人可以算得上是『意大利通』，這似乎跟中國的許多『日本通』一樣一旦「通」了，就會有「親」的嫌疑。</p>

<h3 id="c30">作弊世界 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>天下那有誠實人</p>
<p>我在賣收銀櫃和賬簿的公司里，找到了一個推銷員的位置。上任的那天，營業主任對我說，許多推銷員，只要口齒伶俐，會吹一陣，都發財了。</p>
<p>可是，我覺得這話可不大靠得住。賣這類玩意，徒靠三寸不爛之舌，吹得天花亂墜，恐怕幷不見得會奏效。</p>
<p>比仿說，你拉着個老板，跟他數說：收銀櫃怎樣靈，賬簿如何如何好：王小二賣瓜，誰不自吹自擂，人家相信才怪？於是你就</p>
<p>不得不另換一條路；說；你現在的收銀櫃不大行啦！也許人家會作弊啦！偷他的錢，多心疼，他會關心起來了。但是，空口說白話，還是不够，你要做成交易，先得拿出作弊的證據來。這兒，就發展了我的業餘偵樑的天才了。</p>
<p>我出馬了。找到了一個酒吧間的老板；先吹一頓：好，妙，巧，不行，他搖搖頭，於是，我展開了第二步。</p>
<p>「喬倒是個勤儉的收銀員啦！你給他多少錢薪水呀？」</p>
<p>「喬嗎？五十塊一星期。」</p>
<p>行了，我立刻去調査喬的生活狀况；他有着一輛漂亮的車子，租的房子，傢具，都挺攷究，好大的開銷，我估計，喬每天至少倫兩塊錢。</p>
<p>當然，當我吿訴老板，說我有這樣的懷疑，他大不髙興。他相信喬是忠實的；幷且，說要把我的話吿訴喬，來控我誣謗的罪名。</p>
<p>「我們做個交易，好嗎？」我單刀直入。「如果我沒法證明喬是作弊，那末，我白送你一架收銀櫃。如果我證明確有其事，那，請你買一架。公平交易！』</p>
<p>他同意了。我立刻跑進了那家洒吧間，一面喝點冷飲，一面暗釘着喬。一個鐘頭之後，我明白了他是在搗什麽鬼。</p>
<p>喬的老板，如約來了我請他叫喬一同到後面一聞屋子里去。喬進來的時候，嘴裏還在咬着一根火柴。當我問他口袋里一共有幾根斷火柴，他臉紅了；但只好拿出來。</p>
<p>一共十二根。喬囁　地解釋說，他咬火柴已成了習慣；但是，我吿訴老板，他今天已偷了一塊二角錢，喬頂起眼睛不承認，我說，査一査看好了，收銀櫃裏的錢，一定比外面記的多一塊二角。他不饗了。結果，果然。喬只得承認：他這樣作弊，已經有六個月。</p>
<p>喬撤職了，我也賣掉了一架收銀櫃。這一架比先前的一架要靈多了，以後誰要揩這個老板的油，可難多啦。</p>
<p>慢慢地，我的偵探本領竟似乎出名了，我的一個朋友，在一家百貨公司婦女內衣部做主任。他懷疑他手下的幾僩女店員，有點作弊的嫌疑，每天的賬自雖然不錯，但每星期的存貨與進欵，總有點出入。</p>
<p>他把我請去了，我在那里逗留了兩天，知道她們全有一定的制服與軟底鞋子，每天工作完畢，都到衣帽間，去換掉衣服，然後囘家，第三天晚上，公司已經完畢，我跑進了女子衣帽間，把她們的衣服與鞋子，全詳細檢査了一番，行了，我找到了線索。</p>
<p>第四天，我準備去破案了。先叫幾個人，到婦女內衣部，去買一點零碎，付的都是銀角子，而且都劃上了記號！</p>
<p>下午我冒充一家鞋公司推銷員，跑去跟他們說：鞋公司要做廣吿，送她們每人一雙鞋子，便宜事那個不貪！她們一共五個人，都起勁地來試穿新鞋了。把舊的軟底鞋在一邊，我便自那些軟鞋的夾底里，倒出了不少的銀角子，許多都是劃了記號的。</p>
<p>你們覺得奇怪嗎？一點也不。那天晚上，我去査她們的衣服，就見到鞋底里不少角子的印子呢！</p>
<p>飲食店里的女招待，也是作弊大王。你只要看她老在收銀櫃前打轉轉，或在櫃台上畫圈圈，那就是在計算：收銀櫃今天又「多」多少了。</p>
<p>我的營業主任，把世界上的人，分成三類：四分之一，是寧願餓死不做賊。四分之一是偷竊專家，小至一根火柴，大至諾曼第號大輪船，都在牧羅之列。還有一半，則是普通人，以隨機應變爲原則。</p>
<p>最後，我得聲明：我是美國人，說的是美國。中國是不是如此，不得而知。</p>

<p>荷蘭是處在德國的西鄰，前一陣子，謠傳，希特勒大有進攻荷蘭的意思。可是，荷蘭人，一點也不在乎，他們說：</p>

<p>大名頂頂的赫胥黎大　授，終日埋首「天演論」，邊幅絲毫不修，滿頭的長髮，直披到兩肩：是愛丁堡街道上，最富於畫意的人物，一天，赫敎授又在道上照例方步，一個拭鞋的小童攔住了他。</p>
<p>「先生，拭鞋嗎？三便士。」</p>
<p>赫大敎授望了他一望，那孩子滿臉汚泥，　得不堪。</p>
<p>「鞋不必拭了，要是你能去洗一洗臉，我給你六便士。」</p>
<p>「好！」孩子答應了，跑到附近的水池，洗得乾乾凈凈，跑了囘來。</p>
<p>「復好，孩子，這六便士是你的了。」赫敎授笑着，掬出了六便士。</p>
<p>「我不要，」那孩子突然一本正經地拒絕起來，「我看，你還是留着自己去剪一次髪吧！」</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述一九一四年秋，德輪『凱隆柏齊號』，載着六百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上接着個消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便無目的地狂奔起來。不久，無線電中又傳來附近有冰山的消息，幸虧冰山不久便滑過去了，但是旅客却受驚得失常，閙了一場事，不久，又有一艘英兵艦來攔截了……</p>
<p>傑克連忙又囘刊無線電室，他看見鮑佛睜圓着兩眼，一副害怕的神氣。</p>
<p>「又有一條巡洋艦從另一方面開來了！」他嚷着，『我剛才聽見她在和」，勃維克號」通話，」</p>
<p>『不壞呀」，傑克說，這時此爾南諾和魯蒙加羅都來了。</p>
<p>『喂，比爾，』他接上去說，『現在你有機會在火線上啦。』</p>
<p>『你說的甚麽？」比爾問。</p>
<p>『船長當眞要停船了嗎？」那位法國飛行家問。</p>
<p>「停些什麼啊，』傑克說，『他只是一意的想拖囘他的船，任何危險他都不顧。』</p>
<p>「我覺得她跑得更快啦，」比爾說，『她預備竄過去，是麽？』</p>
<p>『就是這個打算。』傑克說：那法國人聳聳肩說。</p>
<p>『這些德國人，都是不明事理的。』</p>
<p>「又有消息來啦，」海斯舉起手來，呌他們靜一點。</p>
<p>他們都從他肩上看下去，看他迅速的寫着：</p>
<p>最後的警吿，再不停船，就有所對付。</p>
<p>下而簽名的，仍舊是起先發命令的「勃維克號」。</p>
<p>『朋友們，船長最好注意點這個警吿，』加羅說，『英國人是不慣玩『恫嚇』的把戲的。』</p>
<p>但是，傑克去送了信囘來說，船長仍舊固執如常，他唯一的信條，還是叫船更開快些。</p>
<p>「我猜，他想我們一定能够溜之大吉，給鞋底給英國兵艦看呢』</p>
<p>那條巡洋艦正成個角度的，向着他們進發，在她的船尾上，有面英國海軍旗，他們仔細看了一會，傑克喊起來了：</p>
<p>『這是『喬佛號』！我相信運氣好點的話，我們逃得過她，『凱隆伯齊』要算這條航綫上最快的船了，只要他的爐不爆開來，我們或奢可不能避過這條兵艦。</p>
<p>『我希望能够，』比爾連忙說，『我幷不眞是一個胆小的人，不過，我總覺得，現在，巳經成了人家一個目標，還想溜過，這機會只伯很少吧！』</p>
<p>『若是找不久能參加戰爭，我　挺髙與去受火藥的洗禮。』那法國人說，『我想，我會被派入空取，據說德國有點很不錯的飛機，大砲哩。』</p>
<p>『看，』比爾忽然喊起來，『來啦——』</p>
<p>從那兵艦的砲位前面冒出了一跟着就是嘹唳的一聲上在他們頭上股白煙，飛過，連上來一個震耳的囘音。</p>

<h3 id="c36">今天棒球戰　中華初逢友啤　勝負問題關係錦標極大　中華必須取勝方有希望　第二塲乃南華對岷甸奴 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>（本報專訊）今天上午十時起，公開棒球在加山排演連抬好、而亦俱由兩華軍出馬與外隊週旋，第一幕是中華對友卑、第二慕乃南華戰岷甸奴、</p>
<p>中華與友卑之戰、勝負問題、可打開錦標謎局、所以關係極大、惟中華前曾一敗於岷隊、友卑則尙保令剛不壞身、因法、友卑的前程、比較樂觀些、</p>
<p>據一般的批評、中華的人材和實力、與友碑似無軒輕之分、何况兩隊以前猶未經對壘、故彼此技　水準、相差抑或相同、須經今天一戰後才得判別、</p>
<p>以我眼光所見、中華各員够經騐、善於找機會二而其防守聯絡之縝密、亦爲任何一隊所不及、</p>
<p>投手黄榮悛、最善用腦、投出的球、可軟可硬、復有長力、每能審察對方擊手的擊法何如、而遝用其控制之技、故友卑各將雖善擊球、進攻極兇、然榮俊手段不凡、對付善擊者必會獨出心裁、有其制止的善法、</p>
<p>捕手林業素來捉球穩定，絕少錯漏，擲截跑壘員亦敏捷見機，故我敢頂斷今天此戰，友碑的跑壘員欲偷渡必不易，抑亦不敢輕於嘗試、</p>
<p>暗號作合，乃爲中華的特點，此由於經騐豐富所致，遇着强勁的友碑，料其出暗號更多，亦所以憑經騐而制勝、</p>
<p>不過，友卑各員旣善擊球，中華務須壘上防守嚴密，設法避免錯誤的發生，方不致予人以可乘之隙，然中華各員工夫老到，熟能生巧自然會有極聯絡的演出，不慮疏忽，而其制勝之道，或在乎此。</p>
<p>有人謂中華各員多不善擊球，能守能不攻，而其弱點亦在是，關於此點，我亦認爲是中華的美中不足，然而，中華諸將的擊球法，各有不同，或擯或擊，見機而作、每能鎭靜從事，而且友碑投手夏髙理祇恃硬派工夫，投球雖有勁道，惟欠長力，復非十分機警，故料他遇着花樣百的出華的擊手、必不易控制得住，</p>
<p>總之，中華善於守，友碑善於攻、各有乾坤，勝負殊難預測、不過，善於攻的一方、總比較各佔便宣、須看中華防守如何，才可定大局、如其防守嚴密、使對不得逞，則左券可操了，</p>
<p>惟此囘勝負的關鍵，料必至第五局後才可判定，若中華在第五局前能堅守不致有失、而乃以豐富經驗撰取最後勝利、那末、好轉之機，當會從第五局而來了、</p>
<p>無論如何、此役中華非勝不可、如其失敗、那大好錦標，會與中華脫離、將來當跑入友卑懷中了、望中華諸將、勉之勉之、雙方出戰球員如下、</p>

<h3 id="c45">讀擊壞集 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>因爲要研究明代驅寇文人唐順之的生平，我特地去細讀了一下唐荆川集。荆川先生極推重邵康築先生的伊川擊壤集，於是又引起了我讀擊壞集的興趣。</p>
<p>涵芬樓秘笈本伊川擊壞集，一共四册，印得非常考究，紙張尤潔白可喜，學校裏　這一類的書，大概除飽蠹魚以外，只有我輩不識時務的人借來偶爾看看罷了。</p>
<p>老實說，邵康節先生的詩，道學氣太重，多半說理，有些地方蘭直全與偈語敎條等無異，詩的意味雖然也有，然沒有哲學意味的濃厚，可以說是一部徹頭徹尾的哲理詩集了。</p>
<p>說到哲理。還是讓馬一浮先生　在復性書院裏去說　罷，我只能從擊壤集中摘錄幾句足以箴戒箇人的話來談談。</p>
<p>緣飾吟</p>
<p>緣飾了時稱好手，作爲成處似　家。</p>
<p>須防冷眼人觀覷，傀儡都無帳希遮。</p>
<p>土木偶人</p>
<p>七木　人，愼無相笑！</p>
<p>天將大雨，止可相弔。</p>
<p>目前沒有帳幕遮飾的傀儡太多了，「稱好手」「似眞家」，究竟是不是『好手」是不是「眞家』呢？也不過據稱「和」形似（像敏有介事）而已。</p>
<p>至於土木偶人，一時好像得意地在笑，可是天一降起大雨來，就只好「相弔」了。</p>
<p>東海有大魚</p>
<p>東海有大魚，網　無能近，碭然一失水，螻蟻得而困。</p>
<p>這大魚指的是什麽。我想明眼人一見便知道。目前好象一切綱窖都不能近它，等刻它勢窮力蹙的時候，立刻就要變爲「固　之附」，死期　近了。</p>
<p>又，康節先生在其「奢侈吟」中有云：「侈不可極，奢不可窮；極則有禍，窮則有凶。』在今日猶不免於奢侈習慣的我國人，似乎亟應以之爲炯戒吧。</p>
<p>他對於書蠹極端反對，足見他並不是主張死讀書的人，有曝書吟一首爲證。</p>
<p>蟲蠹書害少，人蠹書害多。蟲蠹曝已去，人蠹當如何。</p>
<p>他對於詩的主張如下：</p>
<p>何故謂之詩？詩者言其志。旣甩言成章，遂道心中事。不止鍊其辭，抑亦鍊其意。鍊辭得奇句，鍊意得餘味。——論詩吟</p>
<p>擊壤集有四册二十卷之多，可談的話太多，我所引的，只不過上面寥寥數十言而已，眞是所謂「任憑它弱水三千，我只取一瓢飲』也。</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>—戰地追記—</p>
<p>從麻城折囘宋埠，天正下着傾盆大雨，一輛供運輸用的敞車，在泥濘飛濺的黑夜中奔馳，跟呷醉了老酒的人一樣，那麽一歪一斜地。我們沒有帶雨具，只好團伏在一起，把航髒的油布遮蔽着。可是雨却越下越大，彷彿瀑布傾瀉，江河倒流，弄得滿身淋漓，跟落湯雞相同的了。不過想到燄塹裏面的英勇門士，有時下起雨來，儘管水沒過膝頭，他們還是精神抖擻，保持着原來的姿態；所以我們對於暴風雨的來襲，不單處之泰然，更要感謝天公的好意，給我們洗去了征塵。</p>
<p>卡車駛進了樹木森森的兵監部，陳參議已經備下晚飯；待飯畢就寢時，我將鄉村訪問作爲話題，對他述說一遍。兵監部的鄭主任，在北伐時期，也担任過軍事運輸，據他說政治工作做得最特色的，要讓還八路軍，其次就推廣西，麻城有這樣的成績，當然可以滿意的。「打流動戰，沒有老百姓合作，那是絕對不威的！」他堅决地說。</p>
<p>陳參議挺健談，一口的崇明官話，跟曹聚仁兄的浦江官話，有『異曲同工』之妙；在瀰天烽火中得與風雨聯牀，的確意想不到。</p>

<p>這樣結束了當夜的談話。所以說武漢的撤軍，關係在於廣州，要不然，三鎭是不致遽陷的。翌晨，我們準備舒齊，決往潢川一行；這時平漢綫南段戰事，已展開極激烈的一幕。甚至謠傳信陽卽將放棄。「他們果然踏進了大別山脈，就無異足陷泥淖，除了淪爲異域之鬼，便休想生還了。』鄭主任說，快意的微笑，掠過他的圓臉。但我們正要吿別宋埠，兵監部接到潢川來電，知道李宗仁將軍不日來鄂，而武漢文化界到此勞軍的消息，也同時證實，這眞是意外的喜訊，除去我與老姚之外；其餘七人，全是皖省民衆代表，任務爲獻旗致敬，事畢仍須囘皖，所以一路同行。</p>
<p>僅僅隔了兩個鐘頭，李將軍已從前方囘來，英姿颯爽，丰神奕奕，一點兒沒有倦容。他稍微休息一下，便接見獻旗諸代表，那麽雍容和　的態度，不由不使人肅然景仰。</p>
<p>『啊啊！太辛苦了！李將軍首先發言，笑容可掬地。』</p>
<p>『理應恭詣前方奉默的，請司令長官原諒！』</p>
<p>吳小姐代表全體表示歉意，在莊嚴肅穆的禮節中，捧陳了紅綢的旗幟，接者，她又將皖省民衆擁護的　情，用簡單明快的語句陳述，這才告辭了出來。「偉大的民族抗爭領導者！」吳小姐誠服地崇讀着。</p>
<h3 id="c47">一個譯者的意見 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>偶然翻翻最近出版書籍的目錄，不禁注意到出版界方面一種可注意的現象：那翻譯的作品大有凌駕乎一般創作品以上的趨勢。單就分量言，那麽寫作的東西無疑仍居多數，但就質景和對於讀者的號召能力言，譯品的東西在比例上確乎佔着壓倒的優勢。</p>
<p>拿上海的情形言，最近期內出版方面的最大功績之一，當推「魯迅全集』的出版。但同時在翻譯方面也出現了「列寗全集」和全譯本的「資本論」，可是在新的創作方面，我們迄今爲止，還沒有見過十分有力量的作品（不論屬於那一方面性質的）。但在翻譯作品方面，却出現了相當多的足以號召一大都分讀者的東西。除前舉的「列寗集」，「資本論」外，一年來出版的比較有名的譯作尙有「西行漫記』，『續西行漫記』『日本向全世界挑戰』，「日本在中國的賭博」，『新生的中國』，「日本的間諜」。『日軍在華暴行錄」，『紅前綫』，蘇聯新憲法」；「中國爲自由的鬥爭』，「新中國印象記」以及最近出版的賽珍的『愛國者』，和隨『歐洲之內幕』後現正由一批人在趕譯中的『亞洲之內幕』等等。而且在預吿中以及筆者個人所曉得有人在翻譯中的東西，更有七八種之多。</p>
<p>翻譯界的這種『景氣』的現象，就好的一面言，則介紹外人的觀點思想，以作自國文化工作的一個借鑑，原是一件很可喜的現象。我們决不能够嫌翻譯的東西太多了。其實比起我們的×國來，我們的介紹工作還是望塵莫及，雖然目前日本的情形，就介紹工作的質的方面言，是遠不及我們的。</p>
<p>但這里我們應該反省的是：何以外國的作者偏偏寫了如許關於最近中國問題的作品（或中日問題及遠東問題），而我們自國的作者却反沒有那樣的成績足以示人？一個外國記者來到中國觀察一二年後，囘國就出版了關於中國問　的書，照理說，比外國記者有更多方便的中國記者，理應有更好的成題，可是實際上雖不能說絕對沒有，但有價値作品問世的，却是少數中的少數。</p>
<p>例如像『愛國者』那種小說。中國的文藝作者中決不是沒有人能够寫。我個人甚至深信如果由一個已有文學修養和技術的中國作家來處理同樣的題材，一定能比賽珍珠，寫出更好的東西。</p>
<p>然而迄目的爲止，我們還沒有發見的有力量的新創作。我個人是個從事翻譯工作的人。我的提出上面的問題，決不存心在責難創作家的失責。因爲我曉得目前的環境有種種困難。但我不得承認自己內心所常感到的痛苦。當我每次着手翻譯一本有關中國事件的好書的時候，我心裏不得不發生這樣一種感想：何以這種好材料和好題材，不由我們自己的作家去處理組織，却待別人寫好了再去翻過來。明明是自己的東西，却得用着別人的名義。這種現象是太傷心了！</p>
<p>翻譯工作是有其獨自存在的意義的，但一個有民族意識的翻譯者，他不希望專門去翻譯一些本可以由自國作者寫的東西，他的主要職責並不在此。但目前從事於翻譯的工作者，因客觀上的情形是如此，不得不暫時擱下介紹西方文化的責任，而將外國作者搜羅去的中國問題村料，重新物歸原主。</p>
<p>我這種見解也許太淺薄偏狹了，但却出於至善至純的動機。</p>
<h3 id="c48">細菌及麻醉劑戰爭 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Ji　Muray作　天任譯</p>
<p>一九三七年十一月四日，三個紐約化學家，向美國化學協會報吿，在下次戰爭中，百萬人如何可能被麻醉。他們說，　彈中所能裝的麻醉品是一種氯化乙醘，（Acetychlorine）再混合一種能蝕傷表皮的刺激物，因此麻醉劑能侵入血管，使血壓降低而失知覺，變更藥物的比例，可以使有効時間自數分鐘至數小時之久。</p>
<p>許多人將認爲，以麻醉劑用於下次大戰中並不覺其恐怖性，但是除此還有許多令人憎惡的麻醉藥，戰事領袖中或有獸性大發而使用它們去毒害×人的。</p>
<p>（五）蘚俄趕製戰時麻醉劑</p>
<p>蘚俄領袖人物曾公開宣言，他們如被迫而與人作戰，彼等將在最短期間殲滅×人，以前德意共和國的專家們，曾替俄國在各地設立偉大消化學工廠。俄國政黨領袖也從不掩飾，他們的化學工廠是在日夜製造供戰爭的麻醉藥和毒氣，以便迅速地的滅進攻他們的×人。德國的化學工場也極力製造麻醉劑和毒氣，以供下次大戰之用。英國的化學家們，在一年前曾警吿世界說，他們也許會在下次大戰中被迫而拿出以毒攻毒的手段。</p>
<p>俘虜的反抗行爲及常常企圖逃遁，是令人討厭的。在世界大戰時，曾有人建議，强迫俘虜吸食鴉片，以便省除麻煩，幸而未切實採用。但在下次大戰時，或者會採用的。或者竟有狠心的國家會用一種「催眠丸」給他們的俘虜受用。由於一種惡性麻藥的影響，能使得俘虜酷嗜殘殺，同時神智昏迷，不能分淸×友，而被遺回本國去殺自己的伙伴。</p>
<p>（六）人道的戰爭（？）</p>
<p>科學專家們想利甩麻醉劑毒氣作戰爭武器，以赦其製造殺人的武器的責任因而著文論辯說，以麻藥毒氣爲武器較之以砲火炸碎人體爲人道些，慈悲些。並說如以使×人屈服爲最後目的，則儘可出諸較爲人道的方法，卽以麻醉劑使×人失去意識。他們指陳至少有十幾種麻醉劑可使人性冷淡，不願作任何事情，也討厭任何事體，唯一的切望只是「和平」。</p>
<p>試想，如在戰時整國的人民都受了這種麻醉，那末重要的工業都會停頓，軍火廠連一個小零件，也造不出來，自然會戰敗了。</p>
<p>好幾個著名的專家都曾宣稱，在戰時下麻藥於敵國飲用水源是輕而易舉的事。要在食物中下麻藥是較爲困難，而水源是很容易投下麻藥的。</p>
<p>這樣麻醉×人的方法，卽使大規模的使用，也不易被察覺、因為沒有顯著的徵兆，沒有毒害，沒有死亡，只不過增加國家觀念的冷淡。人民將不問戰事的勝負屬誰，只希望快點太平，什麼條件都不管。</p>
<p>現在來說麻醉藥將會是世界戰爭的決勝因素，似乎是夢囈，但我們要記得，近代戰爭武器如飛機，潛艇，坦克等，以前也以爲是人們的夢幻哩！（譯自世界雜誌）</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>週末的香港，都市的動脈跳動得更加緊張，形形巴色的人們，各走各的去處，各尋各的樂趣。這裏所要報道的，是大香港中另一個角落的動態，十多位文藝工作者，集中到靑年記者學會的騎樓，香港『文協』座談會，這是第三次了。</p>
<p>昨天下午六時，吳量嵩，陳拉特麥穗，胡危　，王劍鳴，朱奇卓，呂　良，陳達人郭步陶，温功義李馳，黃　魯等先後出席，林煥平，徐景元的意見亦用書面，代表他到會，主席是吳景嵩先生，座談的中心原是：『在香港特別應該寫些什麽」？可是大家一高興，想到什麽，就說什麽，空氣活潑輕鬆，而饒有趣，是興　盡致的一個座談會，與公式化，枯燥乏味的完全兩樣。正因爲發霄者，很自由地沒有囿於形式，這裏便只能作一個速寫而已。</p>
<p>關於「在香港特別應該寫些什　」</p>
<p>各人的意見大概是這樣的：</p>
<p>林煥平：</p>
<p>一，形式方面，應該注意香港的特殊環境，香港對祖國抗戰的關係對中英友誼的關係，香港與英法美的關係等，而注意技巧之學習。</p>
<p>（二），內容方面。須把握得住香港各社會階層的生活動態，抗戰情緒，而具體地深刻　表現之更具體地說，如『救國無門』的靑年，頹廢　靡的齊年，『高等難民』與「寓公」，中下層民衆爱國的熱烈，若干富翁們對抗戰妁冷寞，××××××××，外國人士對我抗戰同情的程度之高低，起落，等等，凡此，都只有用具體的形象才能深刻表現出來，客觀的形勢也要求着我們的作家做這一步工作。</p>
<p>吳景嵩：在香港從事寫作，我以爲無妨從這幾方面着手：</p>
<p>一，荒淫與無恥的黑暗而的揭露；</p>
<p>二，我們如採用廣大讀者所愛好的舊形式作品，須　上積極的作用；</p>
<p>三，鼓勵僑胞踴輸將，××××，亦是此時此　所需要的；</p>
<p>四，寫抗戰的文章避忌表面化，黑幕的暴露亦是必要的，</p>
<p>胡危舟：副刊的編者及作者彼此的作風及態度亦有改變的必要，無論那一家報紙的副刊，都有他們作用，不能有所軒輊，任何讀者們的都要注意去爭取</p>
<p>陳拉特：新內容的小報代替有毒的小報，是很關要緊的。</p>
<p>吳景嵩：副刊中自長篇舊小說每天每節有一個高潮，很容易引起讀者的興趣，可是，新小說作家多數就沒有這種經騐，不容易引起讀者的興趣，這並不是作品本身的問題，而是不適官於分段在副刊上連續發表，是一個很值得研究的問題。</p>
<p>陳達人：『香港人』的生活形態决定他們喜歡香豔的小說，無妨把「香　』作爲題材加進新的內容，</p>
<p>王劍鳴：作品應該接近廣大的勞苦大衆。</p>
<p>郭步陶：境環的關係，亦有顧忌，</p>
<p>朱奇卓：寫作枝術亦應該注意，</p>
<p>胡危舟：理論和批許的文章在香港還是很缺乏。</p>
<p>陳達人：新連環　很需要提倡的，</p>
<p>吳景嵩：我們的兒童敎育，兒童文學實在太不够了。今後，兒童讀物應該提高科學水準，敎師，應該有一般的科學素食，</p>
<p>關於下次座談會的中心定爲『新書的評介問題』，推定李馳先生任主席，一個活潑、充實、生動，納座談會，盡興地開了二三個鐘頭遂吿結束。</p>

<h3 id="c66">香港青年劇人的新任務　金山先生在業餘聯誼社歡送會講 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 胡奇筆　弦卓記</p>
<p>從「吃棕子」說起</p>
<p>謝謝業餘聯誼社的朋友們的盛意在今天舉行這樣有意義的集會這種隆情厚誼，使我們永遠的銘記着—</p>
<p>今天，恰巧是端午節，我們在這裏歡叙一堂，吃吃棕子，這實在是一個難得的機會。在今天，照我們中國人的常情，不免要興起「每逢佳節倍思親」之感，我剛才在沉默中吃棕子，感情非常激動，內心也有無限的感慨—</p>
<p>我幷不是思親，我現在在想，今年在香港吃棕子，明年會在什麻地方吃棕子呢？因之又想起了去年今天的情形。</p>
<p>去年端午節，我們正在武漢，那正是加緊進行保衛大武漢的時候，我們一方面參加保衛武漢的工作，一方面和中國電影製片廠合作拍攝「最後一滴血」，因爲在武昌東湖拍外景，所以吃棕子的地方就在東湖，當時我就在想：「明年在什麽方地吃棕子呢？」</p>
<p>沒有想到，今年的端午節，在香江渡過。自然，我幷不澳喪于武漢之失守，因爲武漢的撤退，完全整個戰略上的問題。保衛武漢，目的在消耗×人，索取代價。所以保衛武漢也只是時間問題我不僅懊喪，而且，抗戰的新形勢的發展使我們更興奮，更樂觀。</p>
<p>事實吿訴我們：×人在今天，正是他們在日暮途窮中作最後掙扎的時候，鄂北的大捷，各線反攻的捷報，該處可以看出×人是如何的百孔千瘡，而我們却顯示了愈戰愈强，應付裕如的無限力量。</p>
<p>一脚踢出去了</p>
<p>×人爲了掩飾軍事上的失利而加緊了政治的陰謀，利用汪精衛活動僞組織，就是顯著的一個例子。其實，汪精衛自從發出艷電之後，早已給全國同胞一脚踢出去了，就是上個汪精衛，也是沒有影嚮於我們的抗戰的。</p>
<p>所以，我今年吃棕字，非常愉快，因爲一年以來，祖國的進步實在是太大了！，許多落伍的份子，在進步的祖國面前發抖，許多叛逆，在進步的祖國面前死亡，而×人，更必然在他面前潰敗。</p>
<p>我相信我們今天在香港過端午節，明年今天，我們也許可以到廣州，到武漢去吃棕子了一年以後，祖國必定比現在更進步，因之，明年吃棕子時的心情，一定比今年更真情！</p>
<p>並且，我們要用一切力量爭取到這一節、尤其是居留在香港的救亡工作者。在戰爭中的祖國，自然沒有一片「世外桃源」，今天在國際風雲日益緊急的香港也不可能有什麽例外。香港的安全程度，是大成問顆了，而居留在香港的，我們的同胞，對於這一點，似乎應該有所警惕！</p>
<p>血的代價</p>
<p>記得第一次和諸位見面的時候，我曾說過：戰區的靑年，是如何在艱難困苦的環境中奮鬥！他們是如何犧牲一切，供獻一切！他們對於祖國的功績，是不可抹煞的，而他們自己，在工作中，也飛躍的成長了起來！我們和他們在戰地工作了二十個月，留下了一個非常深刻的印象，我們永遠不會忘記他們！</p>
<p>今天在香港回憶起來，他們的工作，實在是太艱苦了就拿演，來講吧，在香港還可以利用舞台上的一切優越條件，來加强演出效果，可是在戰地，根本什麽也沒有！自然，在戰地不至於像香港一樣：劇本要送檢，但是劇本送檢，最嚴重也不過禁演而已在戰區，那就不是什麽「送檢」的問題，簡直是生死的問題了，靑年的戲劇工作者，他們在×人的大砲，飛機，炸彈威脅之下，不斷的工作若，一直到流盡了他們的最後一滴血。講到這里，我不禁想起了已經殉國的趙曙同志，他是去年徐州突圍的時候，遭遇到×人殘殺了的，他直到死。還穿着演戲時農民的服裝，他的死是代表了靑年戲劇工作者的新精神，他的死，也說明了新興織劇的基礎的奠定，是經過了千辛萬苦的結果，是無數靑年戲劇工作者的血的代價。而今天正有無數的靑年戲劇工作者，在戰地，繼續了趙曙同志的精神，作更艱苦更偉大的鬥爭。</p>
<p>「友」和「×」</p>
<p>他們爲什麼能這樣出生入死的奮鬥呢？原因很簡單，因爲當時存在於他們腦筋裏的，只有兩個字：「友」和「×」，他們一睜開眼睜，橫在他們前面的，是死×，而他們的左右，又是無數的朋友，於是，他們的問題，便是如何把週圍的朋友緊密的團結起來，衝倒×人，打破這生死的難關！</p>
<p>這種情形，要求之於香港，自然不大容易，但是，</p>
<p>所以我們應該警惕自己，把自己鍛鍊得像鋼鐵一樣堅强，以擔當今日的工作，應付未來的問題，確切的參加到鬥爭中去。</p>
<p>設到我們自己，我可以坦白的吿訴諸位朋友，我們有許多的缺點，這些缺點，都是在工作中不斷的發生的，但是，我們不怕，我們從出發到現在，可以說在不斷的克服我們的缺點。因之，栽們雖然有缺點，而我們却從來不讓工作蒙受大的影響。</p>
<p>真誠的團結起來</p>
<p>承主席及諸位朋友的曯咐，要兄弟發表一點對於香港戲劇工作者今後工作上意見，很抱歉，我沒有很好的意見提出來供各位參攷。就鄙見所及，我感覺到，今天存在於香港劇界的，比較重要的，是加强團結運動的問題。</p>
<p>從西安事發起，團結的意思，我們更深切的體騐到了。我們可以設沒有團結，就沒有抗戰，沒有統一，就沒有資格和×人打。</p>
<p>在香港，有很多戲劇同志在工作的表現上，使我們非常欽佩，如果冉努力加强團結的力量，我相信，他們的貢獻，一定要更重大的！</p>
<p>自然，每一個救亡工作的部門，都必須堅密的團結起來；但是，必須是眞誠的團結，才能發生力量！空喊團結，不會有什麽結果的。我們是演員，每一個演員都經歷過用各種表情去打動觀衆，所以演員也最能够辨別真僞，從對方的聲音，表情動作，一看便知眞僞虛僞的空喊，想瞞過一個演員或是任何一個人怕不是一件容易了事；同樣的，眞正的誠懇眞正的坦白，也是容易看出來的。我們不懷過高的奢望，只要所有誠意合作的人，能够緊密的團結起來，己經是一個很大的力量了！</p>
<p>從實踐中演習</p>
<p>其次，我覺得我們每個人都應該加强自我敎育，抗戰與建國是同時並進的，抗戰一旦結束，經過大破壞後的一切建設工作，都是非常艱鉅，非常迫切的，而首先必須動昌所有文化部門的工作者，努力掃除文盲，戲劇是文化的一個重要部門，我們安運用戲劇作敎育民衆的工具，要担負起未來艱鉅的工作，首先應該敎育自己，充實自己。</p>
<p>加强自我敎育，自然包括學術的修養與人格的鍛鍊。我深信留港的戲劇工作者，早已注意到這個問題了。但是學是沒有止境的，我們都需要不斷的學習，我誠懇的吿訴各位朋友，我常常感覺到自己非常不够，因之常努力不放棄每一個學習的機會，我們應該彼此互相學習互相敎育，誰能說自已不需要學習了嗎？絕對沒有的！但是我們是向什麽人學習呢，我以爲彼此互相學習是一個方法，但同時重要注意在實踐中去學習——工作中學習，諸位朋友，我覺得這是最好的最可靠的方法。</p>
<p>希望明年更青年</p>
<p>說到這里，我順便來說另外一件事，就是「靑年戲劇工作者」這一名詞的看法問題，我以爲這裏所指的靑年，不應該形式的去理解，以爲年紀小的便是靑年，也不該單紳的去看，以爲演過多少年的戲劇，幹過多少年的戲劇運動，有過多少年舞台經騐，便算靑年。我覺得，靑年的含義，應該是指那些有豐富的生命力，有堅强的鬥志，有高度的熱情，可以代表一種新的希望，新的精神新的力量，這樣的鬥士，才配稱靑年！</p>
<p>我很慚愧，沒有資格配稱爲「靑年」，我們團體裏的同志，也實在沒有一個人配稱作「靑年」，因爲我們的缺點實在太多！固然我們可以克服我們的缺點，但是缺點存在一天，便一天不能算是靑年。</p>
<p>我們一定要答謝許多朋友的鼓勵與期望，希望明年比今年靑年一點，同時希望明年再在另一個地方歡聚一堂的時候，在座的靑年此今天更多一點！</p>
<p>兄弟的話說得復拉雜，但是完出於至誠，完了！</p>

<p>「黎明之前」劇照：「賊」，中救演出。</p>
<p>留港劇人爲籌款捐助祖國文化事業善舉，特於本月十六七兩日舉行聯合大義演，參加者有：中藝，中旅，中救等，詳情曾載上期本刊，下列劇照，因上期趕製電版不及，本期特爲補登。</p>
<h3 id="c67">「中救」，在工作上再見！ <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>各界賑聯會及業聯贈旗歡送出國</p>
<p>爲了慰勞，爲了激勵，香港各界賑聯會於二十日一個酷熱的下午，在華商總會聯合各僑團開會歡送「中救」劇團出國宣傳，舉行贈旗禮，融洽，緊張的空氣籠罩着整個的會場。</p>
<p>參加歡送的主人，有各界賑聯會，華商總會，記者公會，婦女兵災會，女靑年會，婦女新運會，鐘聲慈善社，東華醫院，廣聯商會等團體的代表。用茶點後，主席李建豐，黃招若蘭，曹學愚，盧國棉等相繼致詞，對於該團之工作表現，及團員服務精神，多所讚揚與獎勉。旋舉行贈旗禮，計賑聯會贈旗一面上書「現身說法」；記者公會贈旗一面上書「攻心爲上」；李建豐個人贈旗一面，上書「口誅」，各有深刻寓意，用資互勉。</p>
<p>翌日二十一晚——是舊曆的端牛節——在灣仔東方小衹園素菜館，又有一個聚餐歡送會以活潑，嚴肅的姿態出現，主人是見賢思齊，從善如流的業餘聯誼社，這樣一個不可多得的聚會，並不是偶然的。</p>
<p>出席者除「中救」團員，「業聯」社昌外，還有戲劇界先進參加。約莫一百個熱血奔騰的靑年，剛好給一個並不十分覺大的餐堂緊緊園住。頭上的電風扇轉個不停，使人忘却了熱暑的苦悶</p>
<p>首先，是主席姚建候致問，他雖然在銀行界服務多年，言表之間，却洋溢着靑春的活躍。業聯很多朋友，亦都是這種典型的可敬人物</p>
<p>他說，送中救朋友出國宣傳，有如送鬥士上戰場一樣。中救值得得我們學習的優點，第一是有高度的熱情××××××××，第二是工作緊張，負重致遠第三是私生活刻苦，嚴肅；第四是團體富有親愛，融洽、團結的精神——這些，完全是新中國的象徵。</p>
<p>至於中救抵港之後的貢獻，姚君說：辛苦的公渣，却有偉大的收獲，僑胞從戲劇中了解偉大的祖國，確信勝利的前途，至於提高香港的戲劇水準，給國防劇一個新的啓示與鼓勵，自無待言</p>
<p>姚君還貢獻中救出國要使僑胞：一，澈底明瞭祖國的新生，確信最後勝利之絕對有把握；二，發動僑胞的人力，物力，財力，參加祖××××××；三，粉碎漢奸和失敗主義者的投降理論；四，組織僑胞努力强化國民外交運動，爭取友邦的同情。</p>
<p>最末，主席還鄭重的說，這個歡送會除了吃飯和聯歡之外，應該展開集團的研究，使收獲更加充實，而對于今後的工作有所裨益。爲了發揚中救的精神，塡補他們的崗位，我們就把「中救亡團後留他工作者應負的任」作爲座談的中心？</p>
<p>在一陣熱烈掌聲中，翁聆文君代表業聯，贈「爲國宣傳」的錦旗，由中救團長金山受旗，之後，來賓及在座朋友就在主席的邀請下相繼貢勢意見。</p>
<p>陸浮首先發言：「中救」過去英勇的工作和到港後二個多月來的活動，是使我們每個文化工作者深深地受到感動的！在他們不斷的努力中，已經爲未來中國新興劇運勳開拓了光明的前途，建立了新生的民族戲劇的基礎了。在和他們共同工作的短短期間中，我深深地覺得他們有數點特別的優點值得我們去學習：一，嚴肅而澈底的工作態度和爲民族解放而犧牲一切的工作精神；二，不屈不撓勇敢苦幹到底的堅强毅力和樸實誠懇的高度熱情；三，嚴密鞏固而民主的組織和嚴肅的工作紀律；四，勤奮不息的自我敎育和刻苦耐勞的鬥爭生活。……現在，他們是負起更偉大而艱辛的任務到海外宣傳去了，他們是民族解放的先鋒，我們留在這「世外桃源」的是應該怎樣更努力地去做他們的後盾，去學習他們的精神，去塡補他們的崗位，去擴大他們的工作，負起我們應該担負的新任務起來！</p>
<p>李景波說：謝謝中救替僑胞和戲劇工作者打興奮劑。自從中旅來港之後，話劇運動的高潮就洶湧起來。是不會白來的。</p>
<p>我敢代表香港的靑年戲劇工作者鄭重地對中救朋友說：你們是不會白來的；你們播下的種子是會萌芽，結實的。——一個苦幹的優秀靑年戲劇工作者，天眞誠懇的態度。使人非常感動。</p>
<p>姜明發言像他在舞台一樣滑稽，生動，有趣。大家痛痛快快吃了一頓素菜之後，——並有棕子——繼續着再有很多位發言：</p>
<p>翁聆文報吿中救睡地板，吃粗飯的刻苦生活，和不屈不撓的苦幹精神，並謂他帮助中救演出，有如到中救留學一樣感奮。這位虛心學習的靑年，原來是敎育部派來香港推行國語運動的幹部，現任本港某中舉國語敎帥亦是業聯的優秀份子。</p>
<p>中救劉丹靑用學者的態度說：要使民埃解放運動得到勝利，應該把古老的民族精神從根本解放起來。都市和農村的文明程度是非年崎嶇不平均的；至於香港，亦比以前進步得多了。希望業聯，中旗，中藝等團體，並肩厲進。</p>
<p>爲了中救出國後彼此得互通淸息，互相鼓勵，姜明提議講本報電影戲劇週刊，作爲通訊站，全體鼓掌贊成。主編者陸浮正式表示决盡力負起這個任務。</p>
<p>繼范政吳味耕之後，又有王瑩很温存便和靄的致詞，她說：今天端午節在這裏吃棕子，是很難得的紀念，朋友們的誇獎，希望，勉勵，熱情，我們是非常興奮感謝的。在各處支持我們工作的，亦是這珍貴的友情。我們自身的缺點還是很多二年來，我們不斷地克服着。希望諸位再帮助我們克服缺點。</p>
<p>最末，是金山致詞了，誠懇的態變，有力量，有生命的演詞，攝住了每個人所有的汪意力。尤其是希望戲劇工作者團結一致，加强自我敎育，教育引起每一個有心人的共鳴。（全文另錄）</p>
<p>主席作一個結束之後，由歌詠名手劉影領導歌詠，然後才依依不捨暫時分手。公署組織的正氣劇團，在五冊卅晚出演，一連四晚，第一晚招待各機關各社團，第二晚招待學生，第三晚招侍武裝同演，第四晚招待民衆，這次志出用集體導演方式，動員幾個縣份的戲劇的人才上演，用了四百多元國幣，誠爲空前的創舉！</p>
<p>在演員方面，有幾個便成功的，在當地沒有比他更好的，飾苗可秀的黃景文，飾張生的符汝榆，飾黃老帥的賴世英，飾劉仿丹的鄭松溪，飾菊子的李慕眞，其次的還有好幾個，</p>
<p>他們打算今後工作計劃，每月能够公演一次多幕劇，同時能够到農村去，多演的獨幕劇，把高州六屬的劇運提高，使這種宜宣，能够配合現在，增加些抗戰力量，最近一個消息，，農中學排演「黑地獄」想不日就可以公演了，</p>
<p>在出演後的第二天，曾經公開請各界人士批評，所得結果：</p>
<p>在佈景方面以第一幕為最好，第二三幕有小缺點，第四幕也還好。</p>
<p>在燈光上，還真沒電燈的原故，所以燈光談不到了</p>
<p>在化裝上，雖然有很多成功的，但其中有的過於誇大</p>
<p>在效果方面，都算十分靈活。</p>

<p>高州是南路的文化中心，所以新戲劇運動很容易發展，原因是一搬靑年對這種工作很有興趣，出演地方，凡屬偉大本都是在茂名縣黨部中山紀念堂演出，牠由獨幕劇發展到多幕劇，本年四月間開始公演，「春風秋雨」，高州中學同學爲慰勞出征軍人募捐，導演者，是舊時藍白劇組社員區旭裁先生，觀衆約一千五百名，成績遝算不錯第二次公演「前夜」爲茂各黨部廣南戰工團下鄕宣傳經費籌款，觀衆約一千人左右，因爲枝術上及各種困雖，結果不甚好。第三次，由七區專員</p>

<p>劇目：永定河畔，大地刧，血濺桃花</p>
<p>「中救」出國宣傳，行明在卽，現特應婦女兵災會之邀，决定在七月一二三日假座利舞台大戲院作第七四六次出國臨別大義演，這是「中救」在港最後一次的演出了。</p>
<p>這次演出節目是「永定河畔」「大地刦」和「血濺桃花」三個偉大名劇。</p>
<p>「永定河畔」係前年七月全國劇作者協會的集體創作，原劇分三幕、經「中救」數度演出、加以修改、另加「序幕」一場、更爲完整、全劇緊張熱烈、而佈景燈光，則屬空前、</p>
<p>「大地劫」係四個獨立的戲顧名思義，可以知道完全是經千錘百鍊了的國防故事名劇，「中救」的「保衛祖國」，曾激動過本港多少觀衆，而「大地幼」更爲精練緊凑，定能告訴觀衆以更多可歌可泣的故事</p>
<p>「血濺桃花」的悲壯熱烈和偉大想已爲觀衆所熱知了，不必記者的介紹。</p>
<p>「中救」這次演出，一切佈景，燈光，道具，服裝，都是爲這幾個戲特製起來，除前次演出已製備數千元外，現更特添置千餘元，其偉大富麗自不待言。</p>
<p>想看「中救一的戲的僑胞，這是最後一次鑒賞的機會了。在前次向隅的同胞，這更是一個難得的機會。錯過這一次，便是一個永遠的遺憾，再也沒法彌補了。</p>
<h3 id="c70">如何解决劇本荒 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 知微</p>
<p>劇本荒是存在目前戲劇界的一个嚴重問題。這問題是很早就該提出了的，而直到今天還沒有得到解决。</p>
<p>戲劇是以反映現實爲其主要任務的，當抗戰己經進行了二十二个多月，無數英勇將士及人民，正在天天以血肉保衛祖國的持候，戲劇界還在鬧劇本荒，實在是一種遺憾。</p>
<p>這問題要分兩方面來說。在「量」上，我們要檢討在現今是否已經有了大批足够應付衆多劇團上演的劇本？在「質」上，我們又要檢討這些產生了的劇本是否內容正確能適台抗戰需要；而兩者之間後者又重於前者；因爲戲劇是不能脫離現實而獨存的，</p>
<p>在量的方面，我覺得倒還不十分嚴重，從抗戰以後確實曾產生了不少劇作，在各種書報中，幾乎每本里面都可以見到一二個劇作，但可惜這些作品，大半袛解當作「盆景」看，到眞要搬上舞台時便不免發生困難了，所以翻來覆去，至今經常被各地上演的，還只是幾個舊戲，很少有新的劇本發現，這實在使人焦燥。</p>
<p>這中間主要的原因有二個：第一是由于作者的創作經驗缺乏，技巧生硬，不熟諳舞台條件；有些雖然可以當做很好的文學作品來讀，但却忽略了戲劇的特性，以致混淆了文學和戲劇的界限。在這方面，我們應該要求作者特別去細心研究，戲劇是一種形象化的綜合藝術，它有獨特的性質，是絲毫不容疎忽的。第二，是由於作者的生活經驗缺乏，這樣，反映到作品上來的便是題材的單調，而且陷于公式化和抽象化；例如，在目前的戲劇中，最流行的要算是描寫游擊隊的故事了。固然我們並不否認游擊戰在今天是正在廣泛地開展着，它在抗戰中實在起着重要的作用，確是值得我們描寫，但問題却在乎游擊隊的產生是决非按照着一個形式被變化出來的，它有多種多樣的不同的變化而我們現在所能看到的却都是沿着一個情節打轉的東西，無非先來一個××兵對中國人民施行汚辱，或是屠殺，引起了大家的激忿，於是忍無可忍，便聯合起來把這個××兵宰了，然後一齊打游擊去。這樣千篇一律的格調，不僅可以抹殺游擊隊的眞實性，而且將會降低游擊隊的力量，令人猜疑「游擊隊就是這末一囘事」。卽站在戲劇本身來講，也足以減少效果。因爲給觀衆的印象旣是一片模糊不淸的東西，又因甲乙的面貌亚無不同之處，也懶得再看第二遍。因此我們一定要反對這種風氣因爲劇戲决不是只有輪廓而沒有嘴眼的，决不是只有軀壳而沒有靈動的，劇必須要細膩的書出現實中每件事實的線條、來讓羣衆去認識，去理解，讓他們點頭感嘆，弄到非要拔劍起擊不可，這算盡才戲劇的責任。</p>
<p>如何才能做到這地步呢？首先我們要要求劇作者千萬不要冉憑着自己的空想，或是撫拾一些道聽塗說，來作寫作題材了，因爲邇就是公式化和抽象化的最大病根。不上火綫是無論如何也不會了解戰事的殘酷的，在香港聽警報和在內地聽警報其恐布的心理也判若霄壤。作者要想在這方面投機取巧無異一種愚蠢的行爲，作者一要眞能够縱身躍入到這個偉大的激流中來實際體騐，才能發見許多新材料，才能接觸到更廣泛的現實然後他可以不患貧乏，不隨入「老套」，開創出無數新道路來，而他的作品又無疑是最能把握現實，最能有力反映的傑作。</p>
<p>抗戰正在猛烈地進行實，這問題是應該及早解决的，不僅解除了戲劇工作者本身的憂慮。而且千百萬的觀衆縱也迫切地期望蒞有更多優秀的作品出現！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Legislative Issues Concerning Ethnic Minorities in Southwestern China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Yuchang</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled to or studied the history and geography of China's western border regions knows that our country has many ethnic groups. Besides the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan five races, there are also many ethnic minorities distributed in the western provinces. Roughly speaking, there are the Lolo and Pai Yi of Yunnan, the Fan of Xikang, the Miao and Yao of Guizhou, the Yao of Guangxi, Guangdong, and western Hunan, the Li of Hainan Island, and the Yi of the eight counties of the old Jianchang Dao in Sichuan (now under the jurisdiction of Xikang Province)... totaling no less than several million people, with Guizhou Province having the largest number, where it is said that "the Han account for four-tenths of the population, and the Miao six-tenths." If these ethnic minorities are combined with the Hui in Xinjiang and Gansu, the Tibetan and Fan in Tibet and Qinghai, the Mongol in Mongolia, and the Manchus who have not been Hanified in the far reaches of the three northeastern provinces, the total should be no less than twenty or thirty million people. In our country, because of the large Han population, this is still a relatively small number. According to anthropological research, these ethnic minorities are the closest to the Han in terms of bloodline. And due to historical wars and commercial relationships, they have close political, economic, and cultural ties with the Han. However, on the other hand, they still maintain their unique culture and language and have not been completely Hanified. Even in terms of law, although laws have been implemented in various provinces throughout history and have maintained their uniformity, most of the ethnic minorities mentioned above have been regarded as outside the sphere of civilization. They have not been strictly enforced, and this is still the case today.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the central government's policy towards the ethnic minorities in southwestern China (including the Miao, Yao, Dong, Li, Lolo, and Pai Yi) has been limited to maintaining suzerainty, allowing their leaders to govern their tribes. Apart from paying tribute and engaging in war, there was very little direct contact. They were also unlike the Manchus and Mongols, who once entered the Central Plains and ruled the Han, and who had legally placed themselves in a superior position. For example, the Jin Dynasty legally stipulated three classes: "Zhenren," "Aoren," and "Nanren"; the Yuan Dynasty divided people into four classes: "Mongols," "Semu," "Han," and "Nanren"; and the Qing Dynasty divided people into "Banner People" and "Han People" to oppress the Han. Their economic lives have mostly remained in hunting, nomadic, or early agricultural societies. From a materialistic historical point of view, their ideologies are confined to the tribal or feudal category, which is different from the Han, who have entered industrial and commercial society. Therefore, the laws created by us Han are naturally difficult to apply equally to these ethnic minorities. From the late Jin Dynasty when the Five Barbarians caused chaos to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, the Han constantly used force to conquer them, forcing them to retreat deep into the mountainous regions of the southwest. After the Tang Dynasty, the leaders of the surrendered tribes or generals who had made meritorious contributions in conquest were often appointed as their hereditary officials, establishing the Tusi system. The Tusi was the highest and only master in the tribe he was enfeoffed, but once he entered the Han officialdom, he was in the lowest position. This kind of feudal Tusi had the notion that "I am the law" for his subordinates. He had the power of life and death over the ethnic minorities under his rule, according to his likes and dislikes, and the central government or local officials had no right to advise him. As a result, these people lived in dire straits and often rebelled. After the implementation of the "Gaitu Guiliu" policy in the late Qing Dynasty, the feudal Tusi system was gradually abolished, the regular local government was reorganized, and these ethnic minorities were liberated, allowing them to live as commoners. In all the places where "Gaitu Guiliu" was implemented, most of the ethnic minorities have been Hanified and it is difficult to preserve their culture. But until now, this feudal Tusi system has not been completely eliminated in various border regions. Even in places where officials have been nominally appointed, due to the authorities' poor implementation, it is still a formality, and the real power is still in the hands of the descendants of the old Tusi. Therefore, the status of these ethnic minorities is not equal to that of the Han in fact. The provisional constitution stipulates that all citizens of the Republic of China are equal, regardless of gender, race, religion, or occupation. In the southwestern provinces, it can be said that this has not been implemented, and it is by no means an exaggeration.</p>
<p>In the past, among the southwestern provinces, Guangxi was the most active in seeking liberation for ethnic minorities in politics. Guangxi was also the place where ethnic minorities were Hanified the fastest and most universally. Decades ago, most of western Guangxi was ruled by Tusi, but today, except for the Yao Mountains in the middle of the Liujiang and Guijiang Rivers, which still retain some Yao tribes, there is no trace of Tusi rule. The Yunnan Provincial Government has also set up Colonial Border Commissioner's Offices in the western border areas and implemented special education for the border areas, which has also been quite effective. As for Xikang, after it became a province, it is said that it will also set up bureaus to influence the Yi people (who live in the eight counties of the old Jianchang Dao) who have never interacted with the Han. This shows that after the Anti-Japanese War, as the political center moved to the western plateau, the central government is actively promoting the work of liberating ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>We should indeed liberate the ethnic minorities who are under the oppression of feudal Tusi and make them equal to the Han in law and in fact. However, whether we should eliminate their native languages and thoroughly Hanify them is a question that can be discussed. For the legislation of ethnic minorities in southwestern China, in principle, we should follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. In terms of technology, we hope that the government will consider the following points:</p>
<p>First, the central and local legislative bodies should have representatives from various ethnic minorities participating, so that they can contribute their opinions to the special legislation of their own people.</p>
<p>Second, the validity of the languages of ethnic minorities should be recognized in law, and the use of ethnic names containing insults or contempt for the Chinese language should be prohibited in order to harmonize ethnic feelings.</p>
<p>Third, the areas where ethnic minorities live should be demarcated as "legal domains" different from those of the Han. The current civil, criminal, and commercial laws should be applied according to their economic life and cultural level, and taking into account their inherent good customs, to determine the scope of implementation. Or even enact separate laws and regulations to make it possible to implement them.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Tusi system must be abolished. Special legislation must be enacted for the production and construction, education and culture of ethnic minorities to help them develop.</p>
<p>We believe that legislation based on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings will be the beginning of the liberation of ethnic minorities in southwestern China.</p>

<p>— Gong Zhao</p>
<p>From June 18th to 24th, 28th year of the Republic [1939]</p>
<p>(1) Hesitating and vacillating, Britain and France ×××× Insist on their stance, the Soviet Union's prestige is greatly enhanced</p>
<p>The British and French governments are still hesitating at a crossroads. For the sake of their own people and world peace, they cannot but embark on the path of anti-aggression. However, the current interests of the ruling class themselves prevent them from having the far-sighted vision they should have, and they stubbornly fear the aggressors' fabricated "Bolshevik aggression" used to scare Britain and France! Therefore, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which were the beginning of the anti-aggression movement, are still in a state of taking two steps forward and one step back. Over the past week, British special envoy Strang continued negotiations in Moscow, but because the so-called new counterproposal of Britain and France is still far from the basic conditions of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, there has been little result. At the same time, the British and French governments are still secretly communicating with the aggressors. The appendix to the Anglo-German debt agreement was signed in London on the 16th of this month, and the scope will be extended to the Sudetenland. The new commercial treaty between France and Japan was also signed in Tokyo on the 23rd of this month. In addition, the German Haidong News Agency also reported that Britain and France will both provide loans to Spain under German and Italian rule!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is now adhering to its original position, which fully demonstrates that socialist Soviet Union does not compromise or yield to any aggressor; it fully demonstrates that the Soviet Union is strong and is a pillar of anti-aggression, but it is unwilling to be used by others to pull chestnuts out of the fire. As for the Haidong News Agency and the Allied News Agency of the German and Japanese aggressors spreading news that Germany is currying favor with the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union's attitude is strong, this is a shameless rumor. The Soviet Union will certainly not be swayed by the aggressors' conspiracies, and people of insight in Britain and France can also see through the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement and should not delay signing it: Churchill delivered a speech on the 21st, opposing the policy of hesitating and vacillating, and urging the government to complete negotiations on cooperation with the Soviet Union as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Unquenched ambitions, Germany and Italy strengthen collusion</p>
<p>The flames of war are flying, and Asia and Europe are both threatened.</p>
<p>The vacillating policies of democratic and peace-loving countries such as Britain and France directly and indirectly help the aggressor countries, which increases the risk of a world war. The first to suffer, in addition to the small and weak nations, are Britain and France themselves.</p>
<p>This week, Germany and Italy have further colluded. First, Germany and Italy will send personnel to Berlin on the 19th of this month to discuss matters to make the economic cooperation between the two countries closer, and detailed clauses will be established soon, and the commercial relations between the two countries and Bohemia and Moravia will be decided. Second, after several days of consultations, Germany and Italy established an agreement on naval cooperation between the two countries on the 20th of this month. At the same time, Germany and Italy held naval exercises separately. Germany's exercise began on the 16th, and Italy's exercise began on the 19th to demonstrate in the Mediterranean for two weeks.</p>
<p>This week, Germany's military and diplomatic activities were also intensified. In the military aspect, 100,000 German troops continued to be transferred east and concentrated on the borders of Slovakia and Poland. In diplomacy, in addition to creating rumors and undermining the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, they continued to woo small countries in Europe and Asia: The German Army Chief of Staff has confirmed that he will return visits to Estonia and Finland. Germany's enticements and threats to the Near East countries, especially to the Arabs, have been particularly vigorous this week, and negotiations are underway to exchange aircraft for oil rights.</p>
<p>The flames of war of the German and Italian aggressors are about to connect with the flames of the Japanese ×× in East Asia!</p>
<p>(3) Appeasement? Britain backs down on legal cases, the Soviet Union and the United States protest against Japan by speaking righteously</p>
<p>The Eastern ×× Japanese aggressors, targeting the vacillating policies of Britain and France, also took further intimidating tactics, and the blockade of Tianjin was the most eye-catching move. As British Admiral Keikes said in his speech on the 18th of this month: "In the Tianjin incident, Japan obtained the support of Germany and Italy, which is actually equivalent to declaring war on the British Empire. This provocative behavior must be dealt with!"</p>
<p>What countermeasures did the British government take? It is again a two-sided policy. On the one hand, the British government issued an important declaration on the 16th regarding the Japanese × blockade of the Tianjin Concession, saying: "The British government has to consider all rapid and active steps to protect British interests in China." On the other hand, the same declaration also stated: "The British government still hopes that the Japanese authorities will not insist on their refusal to consider the British proposals, so that this incident can be resolved locally and partially!"</p>
<p>However, the Japanese × blockade of the British Concession, as the British declaration stated: "It is obviously using violence to force the British government and other countries with interests in the Far East to abandon their consistent policies in the past." How can this be "resolved locally and partially"? What will be the result of Britain's policy of concession, except to increase the threat to British interests in the Far East?</p>
<p>Although the Soviet Union is "not involved," the national newspapers have published comments one after another, condemning the Japanese × atrocities and calling on democratic and peace-loving countries to jointly impose sanctions. The Soviet government first lodged a stern protest with the Japanese side on the 18th because the Japanese side instigated White Russians to forcibly occupy the Soviet Consulate General in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Although the United States has been secretly wooed by the Japanese ×, the development of the Japanese × forces is actually a threat to the United States. Therefore, the United States has always paid close attention to the Tianjin case. However, the United States has not taken any major action because Britain has not taken any resolute resistance. However, both the American people and the government have successively denounced the Japanese × and expressed their willingness to cooperate with Britain and France. US Secretary of State Hull officially expressed concern about the "broad situation" in Tianjin on the 19th, and the US Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo has repeatedly protested to Japan.</p>
<p>(4) Reaching the end of forbearance, Britain plans to retaliate against Japan by preempting the attack, and the Japanese × suddenly occupy Shantou</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, the United States, and our country's authorities have successively expressed righteousness and indignation at the Japanese × blockade of the Tianjin Concession and pointed out that victory can only be achieved by jointly resisting.</p>
<p>This expression and instruction, combined with the demands of the British and French people and the majority of political figures, has indeed had a significant impact on Britain. According to Reuters dispatches from London on the 17th and 18th, the British Ministry of Commerce, Finance, and Foreign Affairs has realized that it is unbearable to tolerate Japan and decided to take retaliatory measures: (1) Cancel Japan's original most-favored-nation treatment, (2) Abolish the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911, so that Japan loses its great market in British colonies,</p>
<p>(3) Impose heavy taxes on all imported Japanese goods.</p>
<p>If these retaliatory measures are implemented, it will be a serious blow to Japan, which is suffering from economic collapse. At this time, the Japanese × believed that "striking first is stronger" and that Shantou is currently the only port for trade between Britain and our country, so they suddenly landed in Shantou on the 21st, giving the British commerce in South China a final blow. On the 23rd, the spokesman of our Military Affairs Commission also pointed out that the Japanese × occupation of Shantou, the so-called cutting off the import of our military equipment, is only a self-deceiving statement. The purpose is to expel the European and American forces in China, monopolize our coastal ports, and establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Japanese × invasion and occupation of Shantou is still a continuation of the consistent style of invading Hainan Island, Spratly Island, Gulangyu, and the Shanghai and Tianjin concessions this spring. We see from this that "local solution" and all compromises and concessions cannot solve the Far East issue, the Munich trick cannot be applied to the Far East, and the development of the Japanese × forces is an inevitable trend that will inevitably increase its conflicts with the European and American powers. If Britain wants to maintain its interests in the Far East, it can only strengthen its cooperation with China, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>(5) Destroying the enemy at breakfast, Shantou is severely attacked by our army, and the enemy's conspiracy is undermined, and national politics is progressing.</p>
<p>In addition to the main threat to Britain, the Japanese × occupation of Shantou certainly has considerable economic, political, and military significance. We should not evade it, especially should not ignore it. First, the Japanese ×, in view of the repeated defeats in the invasion of China and the rising domestic disputes over the invasion of China policy and the anti-war anger, announced the occupation of Shantou, which had long been under control, as a major victory after Nanchang, in order to cover up its military decline. Second, the Japanese × also wanted to use this to shake our country's determination to resist Japan and help Wang Jingwei and his party of wavering elements and stubborn elements in order to divide the anti-Japanese front and establish a puppet central government. Third, economically, on the one hand, it will prevent the export of goods from our inland areas and strengthen the destruction of our foreign exchange and legal tender, and on the other hand, it will block the economic routes of the guerrilla warfare in the southeastern provinces. In the future, there will be further harassment of the coastal areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. In addition, of course, there are also attempts to contain our troops in northern Guangdong and southern Jiangxi in order to strengthen its consolidation of the occupied areas in the southeast.</p>
<p>However, our defending troops in Chaozhou and Shantou have risen up to resist! We must not only use the spirit of "destroying the enemy at breakfast" and "not allowing the Japanese × to advance," but also give the Japanese × a merciless and serious blow in terms of politics, economy, and international relations. Over the past week, despite the rumors and heresies spread by the Japanese ×, traitors, Wang Jingwei, etc., the new facts in the past week, such as the overseas Chinese groups and individuals from all over the world, the front-line soldiers of all routes, receiving the central government's telegram to strictly arrest the traitor Wang Jingwei, quickly flew to Chongqing; such as the southward migration of the Genghis Khan Mausoleum, the Mongol enthusiasm showed support for the central government's long-term resistance to Japan and strive for national liberation; such as the Shanghai news media firmly supporting the central government and national unity, and Wang Jingwei's peace, anti-communism, and national salvation remarks and terrorist acts have been resolutely fighting; such as our Ministry of Finance on the 22nd took emergency measures to prevent the escape and speculation of gold, stabilize the financial market, and help the domestic production; especially the Central Military Affairs Commission issued an order to all civil and military officials across the country to earnestly respect public opinion and the lives of the people; these facts are enough to undermine the Japanese × current political offensive and the conspiracy to feed war with war, and the international situation is becoming more and more favorable to us.</p>
<p>(6) Far East Joint Defense, the Singapore Conference opens, sharing the same hatred, Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands cooperate</p>
<p>How is the international situation becoming more and more favorable to us? This week, we can list: (1) The Director of the International Labour Office delivered a speech on the 22nd, sympathizing with our country's workers, stepping up the united front to resist the Japanese ×, and calling on people around the world to find ways to provide relief; (2) The British General Assembly of the Anti-Aggression Conference passed a resolution on the 23rd, urging the government to take diplomatic and economic actions independently and immediately to stop Japanese aggression. In addition, what is particularly noteworthy is that the Far East military authorities of Britain and France held a Far East Joint Defense Conference in Singapore on the 22nd. It is said that this conference may establish the following agreement: (1) Establish a Central Command of the Far East British and French Allied Forces, (2) Concentrate the wartime raw materials of the two countries, (3) Draft military plans in the event of war with Japan, (4) The two countries jointly strive to build the Cam Ranh Bay of French Indochina into France's Singapore, (5) Measures to jointly protect the British and French concessions in China, (6) Steps to protect British and French commercial ships in the Far East, (7) Steps to guarantee the transportation lines with Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States. In addition, it is also reported that Britain and France will discuss cooperation with the United States and the Netherlands to safeguard the Far East's interests and genuine peace.</p>
<p>We must point out here that as the Japanese × forces develop, the contradictions with Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries will inevitably develop. Today, it has entered a stage of direct conflict, especially since the × occupied Xiamen in May last year and the × occupied Guangzhou in October, to this year's February, when the × occupied Hainan Island, the end of March, when the × occupied Spratly Island, and May, when they invaded Gulangyu, and more recently, the blockade of the Tianjin Concession and the forcible occupation of Shantou City, all of which can prove that the Japanese × has begun a large-scale offensive against Britain and France, attempting to drive out the European and American forces in the Far East! Today, the only way out for Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands is to cooperate sincerely, help China win the Anti-Japanese War, and take direct actions to resist the Japanese × in cooperation. The Singapore Conference should be the beginning of the democratic and peace-loving countries organizing the Far East anti-aggression front!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] After our troops abandoned Yuanqu and Gaoluo, new arrangements have been made. According to a telephone call from the front line on the 23rd, there are currently over tens of thousands of Japanese troops along the Yuanqu-Gaoluo Avenue. On the 23rd, our troops engaged in a day-long fierce battle with a certain army in Wangmaozhen and its northeastern and southwestern areas. The situation was intense, and our troops had a clear advantage. There was also a bloody battle in Matigou, north of Gaoluo, on the 23rd. After our troops wiped out the remnants of the Japanese troops in the east and west of Majiazhuang and the highlands of Pugu (southeast of Yanzhang), the Japanese troops reinforced with a large number of troops, repeatedly fought for it, and the fighting became increasingly fierce. The Japanese troops also used a large amount of poison gas. At the moment, one of our troops has advanced towards the Kou□□ area and is attacking the Japanese troops in a pincer movement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 24th] 3,000 Japanese troops from Nanguan (northwest of Wu) invaded southward in three routes, harassing the area south of the watershed. On the west side, the Japanese troops invaded Gouyao, and on the east side, they detoured to Zouma Ridge and Taoyuan. We have met them separately, and they are still in mixed battles. In addition, the Japanese troops invading from Wutai are still engaged in fierce fighting with us in the Bailan Town area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 14th] After the Japanese troops on the left flank of the north bank of the Xinqiang River were repelled by our troops on the 22nd, most of them fled along the railway. We are sending teams to mop them up.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] On Friday, major cities in the occupied areas of North China, including Peiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, and Kaifeng, held anti-British demonstrations and parades to commemorate the June 23rd Shakee Massacre. Pro-Japanese elements gave speeches to the parading masses, denouncing Britain as an enemy of peace and claiming that China would have no peace as long as Britain continued to aid the National Government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Guangzhou, 24th] Although anti-British movements are prevalent in Tianjin and other parts of North China, the local Japanese authorities are currently attempting to take strict measures to avoid anti-British demonstrations. Yesterday, the anniversary of the Shakee Massacre, the Japanese authorities informed the puppet maintenance association that all parades or demonstrations were prohibited.</p>

Newspapers in Hankou are extensively promoting anti-British and anti-foreign propaganda, and are demanding that the regime under enemy control implement the recovery of the concessions, but no action has been taken so far.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Ōtaka, Member of the House of Peers, Honda, and renowned publisher Miyake have jointly submitted a petition requesting the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal to present it to the Japanese Emperor. The petition demands that the Japanese government declare war on China in order to obtain the rights of a belligerent nation. Government officials say that the so-called acquisition of the rights of a belligerent nation refers to declaring war on China. There are two reasons for this: (1) The supply of military goods and assistance from foreign countries to China must be stopped; (2) It is impossible to resolve the issue of foreign concessions in China before declaring war. Without taking effective action on this point, the Sino-Japanese war will never end. Ōtaka and the other two also claim that the reason for directly presenting the petition to the Japanese Emperor is to express the public opinion of the nation, as there is no better way.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Interview with Yan Xishan <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter Lin Huanping from the Minge Society</p>
<p>(Minge Society Dispatch) We—the guide Mr. Yan and the reporter—arrived in front of an old, dilapidated cave dwelling of ordinary people. The reporter heard Mr. Yan say: "This is Mr. Yan's 'mansion'." The reporter was surprised by the ordinariness of this "mansion."</p>
<p>After handing over the card and entering the doorway, Mr. Yan immediately stood up, introduced himself, shook hands with the reporter, and invited him to sit down, smiling and saying:</p>
<p>"You've worked hard. The climate and living habits are different here. Are you coping well?"</p>
<p>His kindness and concern for young people were revealed in the radiant glow on his face.</p>
<p>The reporter felt very apprehensive and quickly replied:</p>
<p>"I am very grateful for Commander-in-Chief's kindness."</p>
<p>Mr. Yan was wearing a gray cloth Zhongshan suit, without a belt, without a collar badge, and certainly without shoulder boards. He was wearing cloth shoes, and his military cap was placed on a low table. He was only wearing a black cloth hat used for sleeping or keeping his hair in place. The cave dwelling was extremely simple, without windows. There was an earthen kang covered with felt, and on top of the felt was a bed sheet folded with two cotton quilts. A small table about a foot high had an inkstone, a writing brush, and a stack of stationery. Two long benches were placed in front of the kang. Two small boxes were placed deep inside the cave. There was nothing else. Who could imagine that this was Commander-in-Chief Yan's "mansion," office, reception room, and bedroom all in one?</p>
<p>"You came from the rear, no, from abroad. What is the status of the overseas Chinese's resistance?"</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed Mr. Yan because he wanted to know more about the heroic resistance on the front lines. Now, he was being asked about the situation in the rear, which shows his concern for the rear. It also shows how the heroic people fighting on the front lines, in a state of information isolation, long to know everything about the rear. After the reporter gave him a brief account, he asked in return:</p>
<p>"What are Commander-in-Chief's thoughts on the current stage of the North China resistance?"</p>
<p>"The enemy will absolutely not be able to take North China." The old general sat up straight, resting his left arm on the table, and said: "If North China cannot be taken, then the enemy's dream of subjugating China will never be realized." He paused, took a sip of tea, and continued calmly: "In reality, the enemy's invasion of us is not simply an invasion war under political and strategic command, and it is bound to fail!"</p>
<p>Mr. Yan usually meditates deeply, and his words often become maxims. In philosophy, he has the "Doctrine of the Mean" with the concept of mother-principle and son-principle as the center of his thought. In economics, he has the original concept of "property certificates and distribution according to labor." Therefore, Mr. Yan's conversation has the demeanor of a Confucian scholar, his words are extremely concise, and he has the spirit of a military man, his words are very resolute.</p>
<p>During our conversation, we happened to have read Chairman Chiang's speech on April 17, declaring the firmness of our basic national policy of resisting to the end. Our topic naturally turned to this. He wiped his palms and looked at the reporter with bright eyes, saying:</p>
<p>"Resistance is the means, nation-building is the goal. Peace and compromise, even if the Japanese unconditionally withdraw their troops and restore the state before the July 7th Incident, my nation-building career will be doomed! Because our two thousand years of great unification (referring to the feudal unified politics from the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty! China) has poisoned the Chinese nation into useless people who have lost self-confidence and have no sense of responsibility. Now, thanks to the enemy's cannons and bombs, the inferiorities in the psychological foundations of our people have been shaken, but they have not been completely eradicated! If the war is once reconciled, then the people will repeat that kind of temporary life, and our country will never have hope of modernization. Judging from the current situation, as long as the resistance is sustained for another year, then those inferiorities in our country will be completely eradicated; the enemy will also collapse. Our country must unite sincerely, progress collectively, and overcome this difficulty, and finally..."</p>
<p>Speaking here, the old general's hatred for the enemy was deeply expressed in his eyebrows, and his confidence in the victory of resistance and the success of nation-building shone on his full face. The muscle movements on that face, under the coarse brown skin tanned by the sun and sand, even more fully symbolized the spirit of hardship and determination when he went to the enemy's rear to supervise the battle when the enemy captured Jixian for the second time.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan talked with the reporter for an hour. He is a talkative person, speaking tirelessly. The reporter was deeply afraid of delaying his important public affairs, so he said goodbye and left. He saw the reporter to the door, and when he shook hands and said goodbye, he noticed that the reporter's clothes were thin and he had no hat, and said with concern:</p>
<p>"Don't you have a hat? You can't catch a cold!"</p>
<p>The old man's kindness moved the reporter beyond words.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Steel Army and Iron Horses March: One of Our Modern New Army's Grand Exercises (Part 1) <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>Early summer. A night of heavy rain washed the high sky of the southern country particularly blue and transparent. The morning breeze, saturated with the fragrance of the fields, flowed westward. It is not known whether it is rainwater or dew, but it still remained on the weathered mossy rocks, the green leaves of the shrubs, and the green clusters of grass, crystal clear and round, reflecting the surrounding scenery. In the east, a range of mountains, like an ancient beauty who has just finished her morning makeup, lightly and affectionately, is facing away from the morning sun, surveying the scenery outside the railing.</p>
<p>The vast yellow earth plain, crisscrossed for dozens of miles, after being washed by the rain, is like a vast Gobi Desert after a hurricane, undulating in waves. Here and there, half-height pine trees scattered and spread their slender shadows, swaying on the yellow earth. There are no villages, no farms, no people... If it weren't for a wisp of smoke rising from a small hilltop, serving as a sign of life, it could truly be said that this place is rarely visited by humans.</p>
<p>From the chaotic small mountains at the southern edge of this yellow earth plain, a red signal flare rose, like a ball of fire, streaking across the clear blue sky, and then falling to the ground with a comet-like tail of light. ——The Chinese modern new army began its unprecedented grand exercise: infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, logistics, communications, mechanized, chemical... all arms acted together.</p>
<p>According to the scenario, the South Army's □□ Division, with the greatest determination, launched a dawn attack on the North Army's important stronghold of □□ Town from the □□ direction. The heavy cannons representing the destructive bombardment fired from the rear of the South Army's position. Agile infantry, hidden under camouflage, revealed their reddish-purple faces. Joyfully and tensely, one by one, platoon by platoon, they ran out of the woods, dead corners, and shelters, like a tooth of a huge machine, closely linked and powerfully propelled. Under the cover of heavy artillery, they advanced northward along the entire line. Machine gunners carried more strings of firecrackers than usual. Mortar gunners carried an extra can of kerosene than usual. Snipers carried an extra wooden rifle, and rifle bullets were replaced with wooden bullet heads.</p>
<p>The sentries of the North Army's defensive positions were completely concealed, digging foxholes deep behind favorable terrain or objects. In a cluster of weeds or a small pine tree, there was often a round, black muzzle sticking out. They watched those "moving plants" with cold eyes, like a cat concentrating on catching a mouse, trying hard not to let the other side know their position, aiming accurately, and then "bang!" A shot rang out. The bullet casing jumped out of the chamber and was immediately put into their pocket. This has been the habit of soldiers since the second stage of the War of Resistance. They cherish a bullet casing as much as they cherish a bullet.</p>
<p>When the North Army's machine gunners discovered a favorable target, three or five firecrackers were set off with clear and loud sounds. At the same time, the North Army's machine guns became the target of the South Army's "kerosene cans", striking the ground with a thud.</p>
<p>The North Army's sentries could not withstand the pressure of the South Army's fierce firepower and began to retreat from both flanks, while still resisting step by step to impede the advance of the South Army, just like a battle for a small high ground. It must go through a considerable period of stalemate, but in the end, the flanking attack forced the defenders to retreat.</p>
<p>Before sunset, the South Army's mechanized cavalry—three-wheeled motorcycles—moved out from the rear of the position for reconnaissance, with the cooperation of the engineer corps, attempting to clear the North Army's forward position area and approach the North Army's main position. The drivers, like well-trained warhorses, carried light and heavy machine guns and drifted through the groves of mountains, rolling up a thick fog of dust. They attacked quickly and moved quickly. With the cooperation of the infantry, the North Army was forced to retreat entirely into the main position before dusk, using the □□□ highlands as a support point, controlling the overall situation, and deciding to defend □□□ Town with persistent defensive tactics, trapping the South Army for a long time.</p>
<p>In the evening, the moon rose above the mountains. The clear breeze came slowly, washing away the gunpowder smoke on the battlefield. After a day of battle, the officers and soldiers of both armies were still in high spirits. Under the moonlight, the North Army looked down on the South Army's position from the □□□ highlands, which was faintly discernible. Sparse rifle shots served as signals for mutual strict vigilance. (To be continued) A reporter in a neutral Western suit took a photo with a platoon of soldiers after the grand exercise.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 23rd] The Franco-Turkish agreement regarding (1) the cession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey, and the issuance of mutual declarations, was signed this afternoon by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and French Ambassador Machiavelli in this city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] The Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement stipulating the cession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta (now renamed Hatay) to Turkey was signed tonight by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and Turkish Ambassador Suad Davaz at the French Foreign Ministry. According to reliable sources, the agreement also concerns the cession of Antioch to Turkey. A similar signing ceremony was also held in Ankara this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The Franco-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement was formally signed at the French Foreign Ministry today. After the signing, French Foreign Minister Bonnet delivered a radio address, stating that the content of the agreement is completely consistent with the Anglo-Turkish declaration issued on May 12th. He also expressed that both the French and Turkish governments understand that establishing the security of the Balkan countries is essential for maintaining peace and strengthening cooperation. As for the supplementary agreement on ceding the Sanjak region to Turkey, it has also been initialed in the Turkish capital. French Foreign Minister Bonnet issued a statement saying, "France has no intention of abandoning its responsibilities in Syria and Paris." The original text of the agreement has not been published today. However, according to a Havas dispatch from the Turkish capital, the withdrawal of French troops from the Sanjak and the transfer of the territory to the Turkish authorities is expected to be completed by July 22nd.</p>
<p>Key Points of the Agreement Released</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The key points of the Franco-Turkish agreement, signed this afternoon at 6:30 PM by the French Foreign Minister and the Turkish Ambassador at the French Foreign Ministry, are as follows: (1) The French and Turkish governments have held lengthy discussions and are conducting ongoing negotiations, indicating complete agreement on both sides. (2) France and Turkey have decided to conclude a long-term agreement regarding mutual obligations for the security of both countries. (3) In order to reach a final agreement, France and Turkey officially declare that they are willing to cooperate and provide mutual assistance and support should any act of aggression occur that could lead to war in the Mediterranean. (4) This declaration and the proposed agreement are not aimed at any country, but are solely for the security of both nations. (5) If the above assistance is indeed necessary, France and Turkey acknowledge that before the final agreement is concluded, a more comprehensive study must be conducted on certain issues, including more specific regulations regarding the conditions required to fulfill mutual obligations. This study is already underway. (6) France and Turkey recognize the need to guarantee the security of the Balkan countries and are conducting negotiations to achieve this goal. (7) Both countries agree that the provisions listed in this agreement cannot prohibit either country from concluding agreements with other countries that are beneficial to consolidating peace. Signed in Paris on June 23, 1939.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 24th] After France agreed to return the Alexandretta region to Turkey, Turkey plans to build a highly valuable military base there. In view of the new responsibilities of Britain and France in the Mediterranean, Turkey plans to expand the port of Alexandretta and rebuild the forts, making it a military stronghold.</p>
<p>Anglo-Soviet Negotiations to Resume Soon</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British government today sent new instructions to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union. It is generally hoped that the British and French ambassadors and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will be able to resume negotiations quickly. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky today to explain Britain's position.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 20th] According to sources in Berlin, German industrialists will soon send a delegation to the Soviet Union to seek to improve bilateral economic relations, and it is said that Germany may provide the Soviet Union with a credit line of 750 million marks. Sources in this area say they know nothing about this. German sources have also denied this. Some sources say that while Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are continuing negotiations, it is not very appropriate for the Soviet Union to conduct commercial negotiations with Germany. However, after the Soviet Union signs an agreement with Britain and France, it may be possible to sign an economic agreement with France.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Orders Arms from Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Prague, 23rd] Several Soviet technicians arrived in Pilsen on the 23rd to order a number of weapons from the Škoda factory. At the same time, several representatives from the factory have also gone to Moscow for discussions. According to reports, the Škoda factory had stopped working for the Soviet Union since the Munich Agreement last year, and now it is resuming trade.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 24th] Economic and political figures here are extremely concerned about news in the foreign press that a seven-member German economic delegation will soon travel to Moscow to discuss German loans to the Soviet government. Although commercial relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have never been interrupted, and sometimes trade figures are very large, authoritative circles here did not deny or confirm the news of the German delegation's visit to Moscow on Friday evening.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 23rd] It is widely believed that the ongoing British-French joint defense conference here is focusing on protecting Hong Kong as an important issue. Defense experts believe that after recent active expansion and modernization of Hong Kong's defenses, Hong Kong is sufficient to withstand a long-term siege.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 24th] It is reported that the most important resolution of the "International Joint Defense Conference" held in Singapore is that when war breaks out in the Far East, the commander of the British Far East Fleet will be the supreme commander of the British and French allied forces. At the same time, Singapore will be the base for joint operations. The strategic importance of Siam (Thailand) was discussed in detail at the conference. Japan has recently been carrying out various activities in Siam in the hope of winning over the Siamese people. The conference is currently maintaining close contact with the United States. It is reported that issues such as Japan's southward advance, occupation of Hainan Island, and the Spratly Islands have all been discussed, and representatives have also discussed how to urgently protect the Borneo oil fields in wartime.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] According to various newspapers, today is the second day of the Singapore British-French military conference, and a military resolution has been passed regarding the task of maritime patrols in the East in the future. The two sides agreed that British and French cruisers stationed in the East Indies and China would jointly undertake the task. In addition, representatives of the air forces of the two countries are currently discussing the use of Indian aircraft to strengthen Singapore's air defense.

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] This Friday afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Halifax received Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi, after first meeting with French Ambassador Corbin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Halifax met with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi for 20 minutes this afternoon. He immediately protested again about the abuse suffered by British nationals in Tianjin and asked what Japan's intentions were regarding the Tianjin issue. However, Shigemitsu Aoi was unable to provide any clear explanation on this point, and there was no credible information from Tokyo. Therefore, it is still impossible for diplomatic circles here to understand whether the Japanese government supports the military's demands to generalize the Tianjin incident, or whether it is willing to treat it as a local incident and find a solution. Generally speaking, the British government intends to wait a few more days before deciding on retaliatory measures against Japan. However, according to sources in Congress, the government will wait at most a few days. If Japan is still unwilling to resolve the Tianjin case through diplomatic channels, the government will be forced by public opinion to make necessary decisions, starting with the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911, and then further restricting the amount of Japanese imports and levying special taxes on Japanese goods.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, speaking to demonstrators in Cardiff today, mentioned the situation in the Far East, saying, "Local authorities in Tianjin have started a local incident with the Japanese regarding the handover of Chinese suspects. The Japanese then began to blockade the British and French concessions and applied intolerable insults to search British residents. This matter has been officially magnified by Japanese officials in Tianjin. The Japanese authorities are taking this opportunity to demand changes to the policies implemented by the British and other governments in the region. However, to date, the Japanese government has not formally made such demands. If the Tianjin incident remains limited to the original dispute, it is possible to reach a resolution through negotiation. However, I would like to add that Britain's foreign policy will not be dictated by another country, and I believe the Japanese government has no intention of doing so either."</p>
<h3 id="e20">US Attitude Gradually Hardens: Determined to Protect Far East Interests <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] The United States' attitude towards Japan has gradually hardened in recent days. According to diplomatic sources, the government has notified the Japanese government that it has ordered Rear Admiral Andrews, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, to declare to Japanese naval and military authorities in China that if American interests are infringed upon, even if the current tense situation is further aggravated by this American attitude, it will not be deterred. In addition, American consuls in China have submitted reports on the treatment of American residents by Japanese authorities in various places. The State Department is now preparing to publish them. The State Department has always tried to downplay these reports, hoping that public opinion would believe that the current situation in the Far East is no different from the past. However, if the reports of the consuls in China are made public at this time, public opinion will definitely be greatly stimulated. It can be said that the arguments in recent newspapers are very different from the official opinions expressed by the State Department, which is noteworthy. According to information received here, the Kwantung Army authorities in Japan are bellicose, while naval and diplomatic authorities do not want to offend American public opinion, lest the American navy take action in the Far East. Therefore, American diplomats are taking a quiet attitude, not wanting to provoke the Japanese government, in the hope that moderate views will prevail. In short, what the US government values most is its interests in China. If these interests are infringed upon, it will inevitably protect them with all its strength.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The "News Chronicle" commented today on recent British merchants' purchase of large quantities of canned salmon from Japan, saying, "Now is not the time to help Japan earn foreign exchange. British merchants trading with Japan beyond the necessary amount is tantamount to helping Japan and being disloyal to their own country. At a time when we are hoping that other powers will take practical action with our country in the Far East, this behavior will suddenly cause suspicion in the United States. In 1937, 37% of the American people supported boycotting Japanese goods, which has now increased to 66%. We must not take any action that chills this view of the American people." The "Daily Mail" said, "If the Tianjin incident continues to exist and cannot be resolved satisfactorily, then Britain should take decisive action and impose a commercial boycott on Japan, which is an effective reprisal."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] British newspapers today published the news that Japanese sentries in Tianjin had insulted British nationals in a prominent position. Some British newspapers even used large headlines. Yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the Tianjin incident as an "intolerable insult," and the newspapers attached great importance to this statement. However, Chamberlain later softened the statement, saying, "There is currently no talk of taking retaliatory action." Diplomatic correspondents from various newspapers acknowledged that Foreign Secretary Halifax had conveyed Britain's displeasure to the Japanese ambassador in the clearest terms. The "Daily Express" estimates that there are 15,000 British people living in Japan, who may be insulted, and 50,000 Japanese people living in the British Empire, who are protected by Britain. A Washington correspondent for the "Times" said, "The number of insolent and violent acts by Japan is countless. The patience of the US government is obvious, but there are signs that the US government cannot tolerate it any longer."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 23rd] According to absolutely reliable sources, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, in his capacity as Chairman of the Balkan Entente, is drafting a new Balkan joint defense pact after recently visiting Ankara and Athens. The purpose of the new pact is to expand the obligations of the Entente countries (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece), and to mutually guarantee that if any of them are attacked, they will provide mutual assistance. According to the meaning of the pact, if Yugoslavia is attacked by its "Axis" neighbors, Turkey and Greece will assist Yugoslavia in resisting. Yugoslavia has already stated that it will disregard the warnings of the "Axis Powers" and is currently standing in the ranks of the Balkan Entente. From this point of view, Yugoslavia's accession to the new pact is a rational matter. When Gafencu returned home, he met with King Carol of Romania, who warmly welcomed Gafencu. The Italian envoy visited Gafencu today for a long discussion. It is reported that the Italian envoy warned Gafencu not to adopt a policy close to the "encirclement policy," but Gafencu's response was extremely strong, stating that Romania must decide what is most beneficial to its own interests and world peace.</p>

<h3 id="e25">New Sino-Soviet and Sino-French Agreements <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Today, newspapers published two pieces of heartening and exciting news. One is the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty, which was signed in Moscow on the 16th of this month, and the other is the Sino-French Credit Loan Agreement, which is also reported to have been concluded on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>Here, we must first recognize that China's persistence in the War of Resistance is for the independence and freedom of our country, and also for the defense of world democracy and peace. Therefore, all those who love justice, freedom, and the international order of peace have the obligation to assist China and contain Japan. The recent UN resolutions on assisting China, as well as the establishment of the new Sino-Soviet and Sino-French agreements today, are all based on this. Any slander that China is being influenced by this or that is shameless and unfounded.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must know that since its founding, the Soviet Union has treated China as an equal, automatically abandoned all privileges and special systems of the Tsarist era in China, and has repeatedly assisted China's national liberation cause. It has been even more enthusiastic since the War of Resistance, and has no other selfish demands. As for France, the pro-China movement has also been very enthusiastic recently. In the future, China, the Soviet Union, and France will fight for the cause of world democracy and peace, and mutual trust will be even more urgent. We must strive to increase the friendly relations between the three countries day by day, and hope that other countries that love democracy and peace, such as Britain and the United States, will cooperate together.</p>
<p>Finally, we must recognize that the increase in international support is entirely the result of our internal unity and insistence on the War of Resistance over the past two years. In particular, the severe punishment of ×××× Wang Jingwei recently has further increased the international prestige of our government and people. We must cherish this glory in order to further enhance our international status and bring about an early victory!</p>

<h3 id="e27">Behind the Scenes of Downing Street: A Sideways Look at British Policy (Part 1) <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>We readily admit that on the world's political stage, the British Empire is an elder brother, a leader. It has been so for centuries, and it remains so in recent decades.</p>
<p>However, we cannot deny that in recent years, the facts have shown that Britain seems to be automatically abandoning its leadership. Take Mr. Chamberlain's ascent to power, for example. For two years, all of Britain's actions seem to have been passive responses, rather than active construction. Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War; recognition of the Franco government; signing the Munich Agreement; withdrawing ambassadors stationed in Austria and Czechoslovakia... all these are actions forced upon them.</p>
<p>And in the Sino-Japanese War, we see even less proactive measures. The British ambassador was attacked, and the damage to British lives and property was not resolved. The recent Tianjin incident has seen Britain's passive policy reach its peak.</p>
<p>The only thing that can be considered relatively positive is the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. This negotiation was originally forced by the muzzle of Hitler's guns; however, if this negotiation can truly succeed, it would be a positive and active step in stabilizing the world situation. But, time flies, three months have passed, and the views of the two sides have still not been consistent.</p>
<p>The opinions of both Britain and the Soviet Union have not been fully and clearly expressed; however, we have already seen from general information that the Soviet Union's主張 is active, decisive, and proactive. Due to geographical environment and military technology—please refer to the special article in this edition for the past three days—the Soviet Union's 主張 is reasonable. But why can't Britain accommodate them? This is what Churchill called the "half-hearted policy."</p>
<p>Why is Mr. Chamberlain always thinking about the "half-hearted policy"? Here is part of the answer.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Before studying the source of the "half-hearted policy," we should understand the three factors that influence Chamberlain's policy: traditional British policy, today's British public opinion, and the movements of the people surrounding Chamberlain.</p>
<p>The simplest and clearest traditional British policy is based on three points: First, to safeguard the vested interests of the British Empire. Second, to maintain the balance of power and the status quo in the world. Third, to dislike the Soviet Union. This British policy, based on extreme capitalism, is often adhered to by every British cabinet and every prime minister; Chamberlain is no exception. The key point is to be conservative; not to advance, not to retreat, not to go left, not to go right.</p>
<p>Today's British public opinion is clearly different from [Censored]'s traditional policy. The most obvious, of course, is the third point: the British people feel the threat of fascism, deeply realize that disliking the Soviet Union is futile, and unanimously demand that the government join hands with the Soviet Union. The power of this public opinion is indeed quite large, and therefore forced Chamberlain to "feign cooperation" with the Soviet Union—we are very pained to use these four words to describe the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, but that is indeed the fact. Chamberlain's deliberate negotiations with the Soviet Union, [Censored]; at best, it is just a diplomatic strategy to bargain with Hitler. Although Britain and public opinion are pushing forward, pulling to the left, Chamberlain still does not want to move.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Britain is a country ruled by law. The government is a party system; but in fact, this is not entirely the case. The manifestos of the various parties in Britain are very vague, so there are many who betray their parties, and speculators emerge endlessly. And the real political line, under the traditional norms and the supervision of public opinion, is still largely manipulated in the hands of people. It was so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, to understand Chamberlain's policy, one should look at the people who lead the way for him.</p>
<p>On the surface, there are two factions that influence Chamberlain's policy: the progressive former Foreign Secretary Eden, former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper, and Churchill; and the standard hard-liners, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. The former pushes forward, while the latter pulls back. After Eden and Cooper resigned, Halifax, who replaced them, is a centrist—recently he has gradually agreed with Eden's 主張—Simon's stubborn 主張s are very popular, and even during the recent cabinet discussion of the conscription bill, he still opposed it, using his resignation as a threat. And in the Far East, he is even more of an accomplice, creating many troubles.</p>
<p>However, these big figures, although they all hold theories, do not occupy a very important position for Chamberlain. What really influences Chamberlain's policy is that group of people who surround Chamberlain, but do not show their faces—the so-called Chamberlain's "brain trust."</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Chamberlain's "brain trust" is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, too numerous to count. But they do not often show their faces outside, and even many do not often go to Downing Street. However, it is indeed the case that Chamberlain's policy is sliding around in their hands.</p>
<p>The most important and most famous in the "brain trust" group are two: the current Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal, the Marquess of Londonderry, and Chamberlain's sister-in-law, Mrs. Austen Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Austen Chamberlain was one of the three outstanding members of the Chamberlain family and had served as British Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was a financial expert and only died last year. But his widow is a diplomatic expert.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chamberlain can be regarded as an "Italian expert." This seems to be the same as many "Japanese experts" in China. Once you are "expert," you will have the suspicion of being "close."</p>
<h3 id="e28">Anglo-American Sign Agreement for Exchange of Goods Supplying Approximately Six Million Pounds Annually; Hull States Prices Will Not Be Affected <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday during a meeting with newspaper reporters that the Anglo-American exchange of goods will be implemented meticulously, so as not to affect prices.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Anglo-American exchange of goods agreement was signed today. It stipulates that the American side will supply Britain with 600,000 bales of cotton, valued at approximately six million pounds, based on the average price since January 1st. The British side will supply the United States with approximately 800 tons of rubber of equivalent value. Reuters has learned that the authorities have not yet consulted with the International Rubber Committee regarding the supply of this rubber. However, individuals close to the committee believe there will be no material difficulties in fulfilling the agreement promptly, as the authorities will specifically designate a period solely for ordering goods for the agreement. The agreement was co-signed by American Ambassador Kennedy and British Trade Minister Stanley. It is reported that the purpose of this move by the British and American governments is to seek mutual cooperation in supplying the two major commodities mentioned above, in preparation for wartime emergencies. These goods are not to be used for commercial purposes. The agreement states that if war does not occur, the goods must be stored for at least seven years. After the goods are paid for, both governments are responsible for consulting with each other and making every effort to avoid market disturbances.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The "Economic Times" praised the Anglo-American exchange of goods agreement as an "unexpectedly palatable" document. The newspaper also stated that the Rubber Restriction Committee seems to have no reason to attack the plan, adding, "The amount of rubber required in the agreement is approximately equivalent to six months' production within 10% of the quotas. Inevitably, the government will require the committee to prioritize the needs of the agreement over ordinary commercial needs. This plan should be seen as a good strategy to stimulate market activity and make a significant contribution to Britain's defense preparations and the solution to America's cotton surplus."</p>

<p>The Tianjin blockade has entered its eleventh day. Chamberlain Yuan-sheng has repeatedly stated that until the final moment, he will wait patiently for the Japanese side to show remorse so that the situation can be resolved locally. An answer has arrived: the puppet "Provisional Government" has presented four major demands to the British Consul in Tianjin. Is this to be seen as the prelude to a local resolution?</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, June 22nd, was the forty-fifth birthday of former British King Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor. No trace of celebration was seen anywhere in the world. In 1936, during his one year on the throne, there was also a frenzied celebration of the "King's Birthday." Remembering this now, it is interesting to compare it with the cheers of Londoners welcoming the current King George VI. It truly gives one the feeling that with each new emperor comes a new set of ministers!</p>
<p>The Overseas Department of the Central Executive Committee has issued a notice unifying overseas fundraising. This is excellent news worth highlighting. This should at least reduce the number of "patriots who profit from national crises" and those self-proclaimed "representatives," "committee members," and "presidents" should also tone it down somewhat. Furthermore, we hope that the central government can also standardize the methods of donation. "Selling kisses," "selling oneself," "dancing"... although perhaps these come from a heart for national salvation, under the banner of spiritual mobilization, it seems they should still be "eliminated."</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, four robbers used guns to rob a fishing boat at sea. The female boat owner, Li Qingmei, fought back bravely, throwing three robbers into the sea, while the remaining one fled in a panic. How brave, female hero! We hereby offer our highest respect. If only every Hong Konger had this ability to automatically defend against thieves, how good that would be!</p>
<h3 id="e30">World of Cheating <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Where Can You Find An Honest Man In The World?</p>
<p>I found a position as a salesman at a company that sold cash registers and accounting books. On my first day, the sales director told me that many salesmen had become rich just by being eloquent and boasting a bit.</p>
<p>However, I didn't think this was very reliable. Selling these kinds of things based solely on a silver tongue and boasting to high heaven probably wouldn't be effective.</p>
<p>For example, if you grabbed a boss and told him how amazing the cash register was or how wonderful the accounting books were, it would be like Wang Xiaoer selling melons; who wouldn't boast about their own goods? No one would believe it. So, you</p>
<p>had to try a different approach: saying, "Your current cash register isn't very good! Maybe people are cheating! Stealing his money would cause so much heartache that he would start to care." However, talking without proof is still not enough. If you want to close the deal, you have to present evidence of cheating first. This is where my talent for amateur detective work developed.</p>
<p>I set out and found the owner of a bar. I started by boasting for a while. Good, wonderful, skillful... but no, he shook his head. So, I moved on to the second step.</p>
<p>"Joe is a diligent and thrifty cashier! How much salary do you give him?"</p>
<p>"Joe? Fifty dollars a week."</p>
<p>That's it. I immediately went to investigate Joe's lifestyle. He had a nice car, rented a house, and the furniture was quite elaborate. Quite a large expense! I estimated that Joe was spending at least two dollars a day.</p>
<p>Of course, when I told the owner that I had such suspicions, he was very unhappy. He believed that Joe was honest and said that he would tell Joe what I said and accuse me of slander.</p>
<p>"Let's make a deal, okay?" I went straight to the point. "If I can't prove that Joe is cheating, then I'll give you a cash register for free. If I prove that he is indeed cheating, then you buy one. Fair deal!"</p>
<p>He agreed. I immediately ran into the bar, ordered a cold drink, and secretly watched Joe. After an hour, I figured out what he was up to.</p>
<p>Joe's boss came as promised. I asked him to call Joe to the back room. When Joe came in, he was still chewing on a matchstick. When I asked him how many broken matchsticks he had in his pocket, he blushed, but he had to take them out.</p>
<p>There were twelve in total. Joe stammered that chewing matchsticks had become a habit. However, I told the boss that he had stolen $1.20 today. Joe glared at me and denied it. I said, "Check it and see, the money in the cash register must be $1.20 more than what's recorded outside." He didn't say anything. As a result, it was true. Joe had to admit that he had been cheating like this for six months.</p>
<p>Joe was fired, and I sold a cash register. This one was much smarter than the previous one. It will be much harder for anyone to rip off this boss in the future.</p>
<p>Gradually, my detective skills seemed to become famous. A friend of mine was the director of the women's underwear department at a department store. He suspected that a few of his female clerks were cheating. Although the daily accounts were correct, there were always some discrepancies between the weekly inventory and the income.</p>
<p>He invited me, and I stayed there for two days. I learned that they all had a uniform and soft-soled shoes. Every day after work, they would go to the cloakroom to change their clothes and then go home. On the third night, after the company was already closed, I ran into the women's cloakroom and inspected all their clothes and shoes in detail. Okay, I found a clue.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, I was ready to solve the case. First, I asked a few people to go to the women's underwear department to buy some small items, paying with silver coins that had been marked!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I pretended to be a salesman from a shoe company and went to tell them that the shoe company was doing advertising and would give each of them a pair of shoes for free. Who wouldn't be greedy for a cheap deal! All five of them eagerly tried on the new shoes, putting the old soft-soled shoes aside. I poured out a lot of silver coins from the soles of those soft shoes, many of which were marked.</p>
<p>Do you find it strange? Not at all. That night, when I inspected their clothes, I saw a lot of imprints of coins on the soles of the shoes!</p>
<p>Waitresses in restaurants are also master cheaters. Just watch her spinning around in front of the cash register, or drawing circles on the counter, that's to calculate: how much has the cash register "extra" today.</p>
<p>My sales director divides people in the world into three categories: a quarter would rather starve to death than be a thief; a quarter are expert thieves, stealing everything from a matchstick to the Normandy ocean liner; and half are ordinary people, whose principle is to adapt to circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally, I must state: I am an American, and I am talking about America. Whether it is the same in China, I do not know.</p>

<p>— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>The previous excerpt described how, in the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Calongbiki" was carrying six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator for the Cuxhaven Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took the ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship ran wildly without a destination. Soon, the radio transmitted news that there was an iceberg nearby. Fortunately, the iceberg soon slid past, but the passengers were shocked and lost their composure, causing a scene. Before long, another British warship came to intercept them…</p>
<p>Jack hurried back to the radio room. He saw Beauvoir's eyes wide open, looking scared.</p>
<p>"Another cruiser is coming from the other direction!" he shouted. "I just heard her talking to the 'Bovick'!"</p>
<p>"Not bad," Jack said. At this moment, Cernano and Lumongaro came over.</p>
<p>"Hey, Bill," he continued, "Now you have a chance to be on the front line."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Bill asked.</p>
<p>"Is the captain really going to stop the ship?" the French aviator asked.</p>
<p>"Stop what?" Jack said, "He's just determined to drag his ship back, he doesn't care about any danger."</p>
<p>"I think she's running faster," Bill said, "Is she prepared to sneak past?"</p>
<p>"That's the plan," Jack said. The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders and said.</p>
<p>"These Germans, they don't understand things."</p>
<p>"More news is coming," Hayes raised his hand, telling them to be quiet.</p>
<p>They all looked down from his shoulders as he quickly wrote:</p>
<p>Final warning, if you do not stop the ship, we will take action.</p>
<p>The signature below was still the "Bovick" that issued the order earlier.</p>
<p>"Friends, the captain had better pay attention to this warning," Garro said, "The British are not used to playing 'intimidation' games."</p>
<p>However, Jack delivered the message and returned, saying that the captain was still as stubborn as ever. His only creed was to tell the ship to go even faster.</p>
<p>"I guess he thinks we can definitely get away and show the sole of our shoe to the British warship"</p>
<p>The cruiser was heading towards them at an angle. On her stern was a British naval flag. They watched carefully for a while, and Jack shouted:</p>
<p>"This is the 'Joeffer'! I believe if we're lucky, we can escape her. The 'Calongbiki' is one of the fastest ships on this route. As long as his furnace doesn't explode, we might be able to avoid this warship."</p>
<p>"I hope we can," Bill said quickly, "I'm not really a coward, but I always feel that now that we've become someone else's target, it's probably very rare to have a chance to slip past!"</p>
<p>"If I can join the war soon, I'd be happy to be baptized by gunpowder." The Frenchman said, "I think I'll be assigned to the air force. I hear Germany has some very good planes and artillery."</p>
<p>"Look," Bill suddenly shouted, "Here it comes——"</p>
<p>A white puff of smoke emerged from the front of the warship's gun emplacement, followed by a piercing sound that flew overhead, followed by a deafening echo.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Today's Baseball Game: The First Meeting Between China and "Friends Beer"; The Outcome Greatly Affects the Championship; China Must Win to Have Hope; The Second Game is Between South China and Mindinao <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) Starting at 10:00 AM today, public baseball will be held at Jia Shan's rehearsal field, with both games featuring Chinese teams competing against foreign teams. The first game is between China and "Friends Beer", and the second game is between South China and Mindinao.</p>
<p>The outcome of the China vs. Friends Beer game could unlock the championship puzzle, so it is of great importance. However, China has previously lost once to the Mindinao team, while Friends Beer has maintained an undefeated record. Therefore, Friends Beer's future prospects are relatively more optimistic.</p>
<p>According to general critiques, China's talent and strength are seemingly not very different from Friends Beer. Moreover, the two teams have not faced off before, so the difference between the levels of skill, whether different or similar, can only be determined after today's game.</p>
<p>From my perspective, China's players are experienced and good at finding opportunities. Their close defensive coordination is unmatched by any other team.</p>
<p>Pitcher Huang Rongjun is very good at using his mind. He throws the ball with both soft and hard pitches and has the stamina to observe the batting style of the opposing batters and use his control skills accordingly. Therefore, although Friends Beer's players are good hitters and extremely aggressive, Rongjun's skills are extraordinary, and he will definitely come up with unique ways to deal with skilled hitters and have good methods to stop them.</p>
<p>Catcher Lin Ye has always been stable at catching the ball, with very few errors. He is also quick and opportunistic at throwing out base runners. Therefore, I dare to predict that in today's game, Friends Beer's base runners will find it difficult to steal bases and will likely not dare to try lightly.</p>
<p>Secret code coordination is a characteristic of the Chinese team. This is due to their rich experience. When facing a strong Friends Beer team, it is expected that they will use even more secret codes, also relying on experience to achieve victory.</p>
<p>However, since Friends Beer's players are good at hitting, China must maintain a tight defense on the bases and try to avoid making mistakes to prevent giving the opponent opportunities. But China's players are skilled and practiced, so there will naturally be extremely coordinated performances, without worrying about negligence, and their path to victory may lie in this.</p>
<p>Some people say that China's players are mostly not good at hitting, good at defending but not attacking, and their weakness lies in this. Regarding this point, I also believe that it is a shortcoming of China. However, the Chinese players' batting methods are different, either bunting or hitting, acting according to the situation, and always able to proceed calmly. Moreover, Friends Beer's pitcher Xia Gaoli relies only on hard-hitting skills. Although his pitches have power, he lacks stamina and is not very alert. Therefore, it is expected that when he encounters China's hitters with various tricks, it will not be easy for him to maintain control.</p>
<p>In short, China is good at defending, and Friends Beer is good at attacking. Each has its own strengths, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. However, the attacking side is always relatively more advantageous. It depends on how well China defends to determine the overall situation. If their defense is tight and prevents the opponent from succeeding, then victory can be assured.</p>
<p>However, the key to the outcome of this game is expected to be determined after the fifth inning. If China can hold firm before the fifth inning without losing, and then use their rich experience to seize the final victory, then the chance for a turnaround will come from the fifth inning.</p>
<p>In any case, China must win this game. If they fail, then the great championship will slip away from China and will fall into the arms of Friends Beer in the future. I hope the Chinese players will strive and strive. The starting players for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Position China Team Friends Team</p>
<p>Pitcher Huang Rongjun Xia Gaoli</p>
<p>Catcher Lin Ye Wu Yiwen</p>
<p>First Base Hu Guodong T. Lee Anner</p>

<p>Shortstop Chen Fangli Anner</p>
<p>Left Field Zhong Cansen S. Lee Anner</p>
<p>Center Field Cai Bingfen Zongbashi</p>
<p>Right Field Qu Bingnan Beishi</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM, the South China vs. Mindinao game will also be exciting. I urge the fans to not miss it. The starting players for both sides are listed below:</p>
<p>Position South China Club Mindinao</p>

<h3 id="e45">Reading "Collection of Destroyed Hits" <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Because I wanted to study the life of Tang Shunzhi, a Ming Dynasty scholar who drove out the bandits, I specifically went to read Tang Jingchuan's Collection. Mr. Jingchuan highly praised Mr. Shao Kangjie's "Collection of Hits in Yichuan," which aroused my interest in reading "Collection of Destroyed Hits."</p>
<p>The Hanfenlou Secret Collection edition of "Collection of Hits in Yichuan" consists of four volumes and is printed very carefully. The paper is especially white and pleasing. In schools, this type of book is probably only borrowed and occasionally read by unworldly people like myself, besides being eaten by bookworms.</p>
<p>To be honest, Mr. Shao Kangjie's poems have too much of a Daoist air and mostly discuss principles. Some places are no different from straightforward Buddhist verses and dogmas. Although there is a poetic flavor, it is not as strong as the philosophical meaning. It can be said to be a completely philosophical poetry collection.</p>
<p>Speaking of philosophy, let Mr. Ma Yifu talk about it at the Fuxing Academy. I can only extract a few words from the "Collection of Hits" to talk about as personal admonishments.</p>
<p>Ornamented Recitation</p>
<p>Ornamenting the edge is called a good hand, acting as if it were a true home.</p>
<p>Beware of cold-eyed observers, for the puppets have no curtain to hide behind.</p>
<p>Clay and Wooden Figures</p>
<p>Seven wood figures, be careful not to laugh!</p>
<p>When the heavy rain comes, you can only console each other.</p>
<p>There are too many puppets without curtains to hide behind right now. "Called a good hand" "like a true home," but are they really "good hands" or "true homes"? They are just said to be "like" and similar in form (acting as if they are very important).</p>
<p>As for the clay and wooden figures, they seem to be laughing triumphantly for a moment, but when the heavy rain comes, they can only "console each other."</p>
<p>There is a Large Fish in the East Sea</p>
<p>There is a large fish in the East Sea, and the nets cannot approach it. But if it loses its water, even ants can trap it.</p>
<p>What does this big fish refer to? I think anyone with discerning eyes will know at a glance. Right now, it seems that no nets can approach it, but when its power is exhausted, it will immediately turn into "a sore on the back," and its death is near.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Kangjie said in his "Extravagance Recitation": "Extravagance cannot be extreme, luxury cannot be endless; extreme leads to disaster, endless leads to misfortune." It seems that the Chinese people of today, who are still unable to avoid extravagant habits, should take this as a warning.</p>
<p>He was extremely opposed to bookworms, which shows that he did not advocate reading books to death. There is a poem about drying books as proof.</p>
<p>Bookworms harm books little, but human worms harm books more. Bookworms can be removed by drying the books, but what about human worms?</p>
<p>His proposition for poetry is as follows:</p>
<p>Why is it called poetry? Poetry expresses one's aspirations. Once words are formed into chapters, they convey the matters in one's heart. It is not only about refining the words, but also about refining the meaning. Refining the words yields wonderful sentences, and refining the meaning yields lingering flavors. — On Poetry Recitation</p>
<p>The "Collection of Hits" has four volumes and twenty chapters, and there is too much to talk about. What I have quoted is only a few dozen words above. It is truly the so-called "Let the weak water be three thousand, I only take a ladle to drink."</p>
<h3 id="e46">Presenting a Flag <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>—War Zone Journal—</p>
<p>Returning from Macheng to Songbu, it was pouring rain. A open-top truck used for transportation was speeding through the muddy, splashing black night, swaying like a drunkard. We didn't bring rain gear, so we had to huddle together, covering ourselves with dirty tarpaulins. But the rain kept getting heavier, as if a waterfall was pouring down and the rivers were flowing backward, drenching us like drowned chickens. But thinking of the brave soldiers in the trenches, even when it rained and the water was over their knees, they still maintained their original posture with high spirits; therefore, we were not only calm in the face of the storm, but also grateful for the kindness of the heavens for washing away the dust of our journey.</p>
<p>The truck drove into the heavily wooded Military Supervision Department. Councilor Chen had already prepared dinner; after dinner, I started talking about the village visit and told him about it. Director Zheng of the Military Supervision Department had also been in charge of military transportation during the Northern Expedition. According to him, the best political work was done by the Eighth Route Army, followed by Guangxi. With such achievements in Macheng, we can of course be satisfied. "In a mobile war, you can't win without the cooperation of the common people!" he said firmly.</p>
<p>Councilor Chen was very talkative, speaking in the Chongming dialect, which was similar to Cao Juren's Pujiang dialect in "different tunes played in the same way"; to be able to share a bed with him in the wind and rain amidst the raging flames of war was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>"There's no problem with Tianjia Town, Wuhan will not be shaken."</p>
<p>"Even if there is a problem, we will never give up Wuhan."</p>
<p>This is how the conversation ended that night. Therefore, it is said that the withdrawal of troops from Wuhan was related to Guangzhou, otherwise, the three towns would not have fallen so quickly. The next morning, we prepared to depart for Huangchuan; at this time, the battle in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway had begun extremely fiercely. There were even rumors that Xinyang was about to be abandoned. "If they really step into the Dabie Mountains, it will be like sinking into a quagmire, and they can only become ghosts in a foreign land, and never hope to return alive," Director Zheng said, a satisfied smile flashing across his round face. But just as we were about to say goodbye to Songbu, the Military Supervision Department received a telegram from Huangchuan, informing us that General Li Zongren would be coming to Hubei in a few days, and the news that the cultural circles of Wuhan would be coming to comfort the troops was also confirmed. This was truly unexpected good news. Except for me and Lao Yao; the other seven were all representatives of the people of Anhui Province, and their task was to present a flag to pay their respects. After the ceremony, they still had to return to Anhui, so we traveled together along the way.</p>
<p>Only two hours later, General Li had returned from the front, looking heroic and radiant, without any sign of fatigue. After resting for a while, he met with the flag-presenting representatives, and his demeanor was so graceful and cordial that people couldn't help but look up to him with reverence.</p>
<p>"Ah! You've worked too hard!" General Li said first, with a kind smile.</p>
<p>"We should have respectfully gone to the front to offer our condolences, please forgive us, Commander!"</p>
<p>Miss Wu expressed her apologies on behalf of everyone, and in a solemn and respectful ceremony, she presented the red silk flag. Then, she stated the feelings of support from the people of Anhui Province in simple and clear language, and then they took their leave. "A great leader of national resistance!" Miss Wu read with sincere admiration.</p>
<h3 id="e47">An Translator's Opinion <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Casually flipping through the catalogs of recently published books, I can't help but notice a noteworthy phenomenon in the publishing industry: translated works have a tendency to surpass general original works. In terms of quantity, original writing is undoubtedly still the majority, but in terms of quality and the ability to appeal to readers, translated works occupy an overwhelming advantage in proportion.</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai as an example, one of the greatest achievements in publishing in recent times has been the publication of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun." But at the same time, translations such as the "Complete Works of Lenin" and the complete translation of "Das Kapital" have also appeared. However, in terms of new creations, we have not yet seen any very powerful works (regardless of their nature). But in terms of translated works, there have been quite a few things that are enough to appeal to a large number of readers. In addition to the aforementioned "Complete Works of Lenin" and "Das Kapital," the more famous translations published in the past year include "Red Star Over China," "More Adventures in China," "Japan Challenges the World," "Japan's Gamble in China," "The New Born China," "Japan's Spies," "Record of Japanese Army's Atrocities in China," "Red Front," "Soviet New Constitution," "China's Fight for Freedom," "Impressions of New China," as well as Pearl S. Buck's "The Patriot," which was recently published, and "Inside Asia," which is currently being translated by a group of people following "Inside Europe." Moreover, there are seven or eight more items in the announcements and that I personally know are being translated.</p>
<p>This "prosperous" phenomenon in the translation industry, on the good side, is a very gratifying phenomenon to introduce the viewpoints and thoughts of foreigners as a reference for the cultural work of one's own country. We can never complain that there are too many translated things. In fact, compared to our × country, our introduction work is still far behind, although the current situation in Japan, in terms of the quality of introduction work, is far inferior to ours.</p>
<p>But here we should reflect on: why do foreign authors write so many works about recent Chinese issues (or Sino-Japanese issues and Far Eastern issues), while our own authors do not have such achievements to show? A foreign journalist comes to China to observe for a year or two, and then publishes a book about Chinese issues when he returns home. In theory, Chinese journalists, who have more convenience than foreign journalists, should have better achievements, but in reality, although it cannot be said that there are absolutely none, the valuable works that have been published are only a minority of the minority.</p>
<p>For example, a novel like "The Patriot." It is not that there is no one among Chinese literary authors who can write it. I personally even firmly believe that if a Chinese writer with literary cultivation and technique handles the same subject matter, they will definitely be able to surpass Pearl S. Buck and write something even better.</p>
<p>However, to date, we have not discovered any powerful new creations. I am personally a person engaged in translation work. My raising the above question is by no means intended to accuse creators of dereliction of duty. Because I know that there are various difficulties in the current environment. But I cannot admit the pain I often feel in my heart. Every time I start translating a good book about Chinese events, I can't help but have such a feeling in my heart: why are these good materials and good themes not handled and organized by our own writers, but wait for others to write them well before translating them back? It is clearly our own thing, but we have to use someone else's name. This phenomenon is too heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Translation work has its own independent meaning, but a translator with a national consciousness does not want to specialize in translating things that could have been written by authors in his own country, and his main responsibility does not lie in this. But currently, those engaged in translation work, because the objective situation is like this, have to temporarily put aside the responsibility of introducing Western culture and return the Chinese issue materials that foreign authors have collected back to their original owners.</p>
<p>My view may be too shallow and narrow, but it comes from the best and purest motives.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Germ and Anesthetic Warfare <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Ji Muray, Translated by Tian Ren</p>
<p>On November 4, 1937, three New York chemists reported to the American Chemical Society how millions of people could be anesthetized in the next war. They said that the anesthetic that can be loaded into bombs is acetylchlorine, mixed with an irritant that can erode the epidermis, so that the anesthetic can invade the blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and cause loss of consciousness. By changing the ratio of drugs, the effective time can be from a few minutes to several hours.</p>
<p>Many people will not find the use of anesthetics in the next world war to be terrifying, but in addition to this, there are many abhorrent anesthetics, and some war leaders may use them to poison × people due to a great burst of animal nature.</p>
<p>(5) Soviet Russia Rush to Make Wartime Anesthetics</p>
<p>Soviet Russian leaders have publicly declared that if they are forced to fight with people, they will annihilate × people in the shortest period of time. Previously, experts from the German and Italian republics had established great digestive factories for Russia in various places. Russian political party leaders have never concealed that their chemical factories are manufacturing anesthetics and poison gases for war day and night, in order to quickly destroy the × people who invade them. German chemical factories are also making every effort to manufacture anesthetics and poison gases for the next world war. British chemists warned the world a year ago that they might be forced to resort to toxic means in the next world war.</p>
<p>The rebellious behavior of prisoners of war and frequent attempts to escape are annoying. During the World War, it was suggested that prisoners of war be forced to smoke opium in order to eliminate trouble, but fortunately it was not actually adopted. But it may be adopted in the next world war. Or some ruthless countries may give their prisoners of war a "hypnotic pill" for their use. Due to the influence of a malignant anesthetic, prisoners of war can become addicted to killing and mutilation, while being mentally confused and unable to distinguish between enemies and friends, and be sent back to their own country to kill their own comrades.</p>
<p>(6) Humane Warfare (?)</p>
<p>Scientific experts want to use anesthetic poison gas as a weapon of war in order to absolve their responsibility for manufacturing killing weapons, so they write articles and argue that using anesthetic poison gas as a weapon is more humane and merciful than blowing people to pieces with artillery fire. They also say that if the ultimate goal is to make × people surrender, then it is possible to use more humane methods, that is, to make × people lose consciousness with anesthetics. They point out that there are at least a dozen kinds of anesthetics that can make people indifferent, unwilling to do anything, and hate anything, with the only desire being "peace."</p>
<p>Imagine, if the entire population of a country is anesthetized during wartime, then important industries will be shut down, and even a small part cannot be made in arms factories, and naturally they will be defeated.</p>
<p>Several well-known experts have claimed that it is easy to put anesthetics into the drinking water sources of enemy countries during wartime. It is more difficult to put anesthetics in food, while water sources are easy to put anesthetics in.</p>
<p>Even if used on a large scale, this method of anesthetizing × people is not easy to detect, because there are no obvious symptoms, no poisoning, no death, but only an increase in national indifference. The people will not care who wins or loses the war, they only hope for peace as soon as possible, regardless of any conditions.</p>
<p>Now it seems like delirium to say that anesthetics will be the deciding factor in the world war, but we must remember that modern war weapons such as airplanes, submarines, and tanks were also thought to be people's dreams before! (Translated from World Magazine)</p>

<p>The British naval authorities, in order to protect British interests in Shantou, had already notified British shipping companies the day before yesterday to send ships to Shantou as usual, and ordered them to be escorted by British warships stationed in Shantou. Therefore, the × side attempted to blockade Shantou, but the British side had decided to ignore them. After receiving the notification from the naval authorities, the various shipping companies immediately resumed the original Shantou route the day before yesterday. The first British ship to break through the × army's blockade line was the Taikoo Company's Jinan, which entered Shantou Port at 11:00 am on the 23rd escorted by a British warship stationed in Shantou. However, after berthing, the × side used force to prevent passengers and cargo from loading and unloading. The ship sailed the same afternoon and returned to Hong Kong, arriving here yesterday. Following the Jinan, Jardine Matheson's Fao Seng also sailed into Shantou. In addition, other British ships will sail to Shantou one after another today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Shantou, Breaking the Blockade</p>
<p>According to the ship's compradore, Mr. Guo Huajun, the ship sailed from Shanghai to Shantou on Sunday and then came to Hong Kong. When it set off from Shanghai, there was no change in Shantou, so it still took cargo and passengers to Shantou in Shanghai. This time, it transported a total of 5,282 pieces of goods from Shanghai to Shantou, including matches, bean cakes, and various groceries. There were more than 20 male and female passengers traveling from Shanghai to Shantou. On the way from Shanghai to Shantou, they received a wireless telegram, and learned that a war had broken out in Shantou. The ship owner immediately telegraphed back to Hong Kong to ask the company for instructions on what to do. They then received a telegram from the company ordering them to continue sailing to Shantou according to the original schedule. The ship then arrived outside Shantou Port early in the morning of the 23rd. At that time, Shantou Port was full of dozens of × side warships, including an aircraft carrier and a giant smoke-stack cruiser, which were anchored near Nan'ao. The others were transport ships, armed merchant ships, and red-topped gunboats. The original merchant ships in Shantou had all escaped. When the ship arrived outside Shantou Port, it immediately telegraphed the British warship stationed in Shantou Port. Soon, the British warship "Scott" sailed over to escort it into the port. The British warship went first, and the ship followed behind. When entering the port, it passed the place where the × warships were stationed, but the × warships did not interfere. There were no obstacles along the way. At 11:30 am, the ship berthed at the dock. At that time, the Yingzhou was still dry-docked next to the adjacent dock. Apart from this ship and the Yingzhou, no other merchant ships were seen docked.</p>
<p>× Side's Rude Force Stopped Landing</p>
<p>After berthing, seven or eight × soldiers patrolled and monitored the pier. There were also three British soldiers, fully armed, protecting the pier. The situation was very serious. Two executives and Western staff members from the Taikoo Company's Shantou branch were waiting at the dock. The × side prevented the ship from loading and unloading goods, and passengers and crew members were not allowed to land. The × military officer was extremely rude and did not even allow the gangway to be connected to the pier. The company executive tried hard to negotiate, but to no avail. The ship could only lower the gangway, but the × side still did not allow anyone to disembark. The Taikoo Company executive and two Western staff members climbed onto the ship along the rope to meet with the ship owner. When the three were about to leave the ship, they were again stopped from disembarking by the × side. As a result, the British warship had to send a speedboat to carry the three over to the Yingzhou, and then they disembarked from the Yingzhou.</p>
<p>Machine Guns Were Deployed at the Pier to Intimidate</p>
<p>The ship stayed in Shantou for four hours after berthing, and none of the crew or passengers were allowed to disembark. It was impossible to load or unload cargo. From the ship, it was witnessed that there were very few pedestrians along the embankment outside the pier, and the scene was desolate. There were only a dozen people in rags gathered on the embankment, mostly poor people who were unable to evacuate. Two coolies risked sneaking onto the ship to solicit business, but to no avail. They said that the order in the city was very chaotic, with rampant looting by Han × bandits, and the whole city was like a dead place. When the company staff negotiated with the × army at the pier, the situation was quite tense. The × soldiers even placed a machine gun on each side of the pier entrance, and many × soldiers were stationed there to intimidate. The ship left Shantou Port at about 3 pm that afternoon, still escorted by the British warship. The captain ordered all crew members and passengers not to stand on the deck to avoid accidents. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at 7 am this morning (yesterday), and the goods transported to Shantou were also unloaded in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Resume Shantou Shipping</p>
<p>In addition to the Jinan, the Fao Seng also sailed into Shantou Port yesterday. It sailed from Hong Kong the afternoon before yesterday and was reportedly escorted into Shantou Port by a British warship. Because the ship had no passengers or cargo for Shantou, it is expected that it sailed to Fuzhou and Shanghai yesterday. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Suzhou will sail from Hong Kong to Shantou at 2 pm today. Its itinerary is the same as that of the Fao Seng, first to Shantou and then to Fuzhou and Shanghai. Butterfield &amp; Swire's Xin Hai Men has not yet decided on its sailing schedule. As for the × side forcibly preventing British ships from loading and unloading passengers and cargo in Shantou, it is heard that the British side is preparing to negotiate with them.</p>
<h3 id="e49">A Lively, Vivid, and Fulfilling Symposium What Should Be Written in Hong Kong? A Quick Sketch of the Third Symposium of the Literary Association Yesterday <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>By Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper</p>
<p>On weekends in Hong Kong, the arteries of the city beat even more frantically. All kinds of people went their separate ways, each seeking their own pleasures. What is to be reported here is the dynamic of another corner of the great Hong Kong: more than ten literary and art workers gathered at the verandah of the Youth Journalists Association for the Hong Kong Literary Association Symposium, the third of its kind.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 6:00 pm, Wu Liangsong, Chen Later, Mai Sui, Hu Weizhou, Wang Jianming, Zhu Qizhuo, Lu Mouliang, Chen Daren, Guo Butao, Wen Gongyi, Li Chi, Huang Moulu, etc. attended one after another. Lin Huanping and Xu Jingyuan's opinions were also submitted in writing to represent them. Mr. Wu Jingsong was the chairman. The focus of the symposium was originally: "What Should Be Written in Hong Kong in Particular?" However, everyone was so excited that they said whatever came to mind. The atmosphere was lively and relaxed, and very interesting. It was a symposium that was as delightful as possible, completely different from formalistic, boring ones. Precisely because those who spoke were very free and not restricted by form, this can only be a quick sketch.</p>
<p>Regarding "What Should Be Written in Hong Kong in Particular"</p>
<p>The opinions of the various participants were roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Huanping:</p>
<p>1.  In terms of form, attention should be paid to Hong Kong's special environment, Hong Kong's relationship with the War of Resistance against Japan, the relationship between Hong Kong and China and Britain, the relationship between Hong Kong and Britain, France, and the United States, etc., and attention should be paid to learning skills.</p>
<p>2.  In terms of content, it is necessary to grasp the living dynamics and anti-Japanese sentiments of all social strata in Hong Kong, and to express them concretely and profoundly. More specifically, such as the "youth with no way to save the country," the decadent youth, the "high-level refugees" and "retired officials," the patriotic enthusiasm of the middle and lower classes, the indifference of some wealthy people to the War of Resistance, ××××××××, the degree of sympathy of foreigners for our War of Resistance, the ups and downs, etc. All of these can only be expressed profoundly with concrete images. The objective situation also requires our writers to do this step.</p>
<p>Wu Jingsong: I think that writing in Hong Kong, you may as well start from these aspects:</p>
<p>1.  Exposing the darkness of licentiousness and shamelessness;</p>
<p>2.  If we adopt the old-fashioned works loved by the majority of readers, we must add positive effects;</p>
<p>3.  Encouraging overseas Chinese to enthusiastically donate, ××××, is also needed at this time and place;</p>
<p>4.  Writing articles on the War of Resistance should avoid superficiality, and the exposure of the inside story is also necessary.</p>
<p>Hu Weizhou: It is also necessary for the editors and authors of supplements to change their styles and attitudes. No matter which newspaper's supplement, they all have their roles and cannot be treated differently. The attention of all readers must be sought.</p>
<p>Chen Later: It is very important to replace toxic tabloids with tabloids that contain new content.</p>
<p>Wu Jingsong: In supplements, long old-fashioned novels have a climax in each episode every day, which can easily arouse readers' interest. However, most new novel writers do not have this kind of experience and it is not easy to arouse readers' interest. This is not a problem with the works themselves, but rather that they are not suitable for continuous publication in sections in supplements, which is a question worth studying.</p>
<p>Chen Daren: The lifestyle of "Hong Kong people" determines that they like erotic novels. It is okay to add new content to "eroticism" as a theme.</p>
<p>Wang Jianming: Works should be close to the broad masses of working people.</p>
<p>Guo Butao: Environmental relations also have concerns.</p>
<p>Zhu Qizhuo: Writing skills should also be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Hu Weizhou: Articles on theory and criticism are still very lacking in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Chen Daren: New comic strips need to be promoted.</p>
<p>Wu Jingsong: Our children's education and children's literature are really not enough. In the future, children's books should improve their scientific level, and teachers should have general scientific literacy.</p>
<p>Regarding the center of the next symposium as "The Problem of Reviewing New Books," Mr. Li Chi was appointed as chairman. A lively, fulfilling, and vivid symposium ended after two or three hours of hearty conversation.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Actively Prevent Cholera The Director of Medical and Health Services Convened a Meeting The Lai Chi Kok Hospital Will Be Opened to Accommodate Patients Clean Up Street Filth and Publish Propaganda Wall Paintings <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Director of Medical and Health Services, Mr. Situ Yongjue, in view of the cholera epidemic, the increasing number of deaths, and the increasingly serious situation, convened an important meeting of medical experts in Hong Kong at the Department of Health yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, various medical questions were raised and discussed on how to prevent the spread of cholera and how to promote preventive measures. Many decisions were also made on the steps to be taken. Moreover, the medical authorities believe that the accumulation of garbage on the streets and the changes that occur are a medium for the spread of epidemics. Therefore, the filth will be cleaned up first. At present, 200 sanitation workers and five garbage trucks have been added to start cleaning up the filth in various districts of the city, hoping to clean up the filth in the narrow streets and alleys and reduce the spread of cholera. At the same time, in view of the increasing number of patients with infectious diseases, in order to isolate and treat them, it is planned to open the vacant part of the Lai Chi Kok Infectious Disease Hospital to accommodate patients. This matter is being actively planned and will be realized in the shortest possible time. As for publicity, propaganda pamphlets and wall paintings have been printed and posted and distributed on major thoroughfares to widely publicize preventive measures for cholera and instill the public with knowledge of prevention, so as to achieve great results and maintain public safety. In addition, the Health Bureau reported that there were as many as seven cases of cholera on Friday, 28 cases of tuberculosis, seven cases of enteritis, two cases of chickenpox, and one case each of dysentery and diphtheria.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Circular from the Central Overseas Department Strictly Prohibiting Unauthorized Fundraising Overseas Fundraising by Agencies and Organizations Must Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Verification Overseas Chinese Groups Have the Right to Refuse Unauthorized Fundraising <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>In order to unify overseas fundraising and prevent abuses, the central government authorities have strictly ordered all agencies and organizations not to raise funds overseas without authorization. At the same time, the Overseas Department notified various overseas Chinese groups. Most of the relevant overseas Chinese groups here have received this circular. A copy is as follows:</p>
<p>Instruction No. 112 of the Central Executive Committee Overseas Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, Hai Chong Zi. It is noted that with regard to the matter of domestic agencies and organizations sending personnel to foreign countries to raise funds from overseas Chinese, the Executive Yuan has issued an order that in the future, they must first submit to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for overseas Chinese donations, the Bank of China in Hong Kong has been specially designated to receive them. Regardless of whether the central or local agencies receive donations, they should be sent to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Bank for verification and collection. The government will统筹 allocate and distribute the funds for use. Various agencies are not allowed to send personnel to Hong Kong or other places to raise funds on their own in order to prevent abuses. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance has formulated a general outline of measures for receiving donations, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. However, according to reports from comrades and overseas Chinese in Annam, Burma, the Americas, and other places, there are still local administrative agencies or military officers who send personnel overseas on their own to entrust local overseas Chinese groups to hold fundraising events. Not only does this go against the central government's orders and cause overseas Chinese to have divergent views, but it is also prone to abuses, which affects the fundraising of overseas Chinese patriotic donations. The President has ordered that anyone who reports that any agency or troop is raising funds overseas privately will be strictly stopped and urged the Ministry and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to pay attention. Responsible comrades in our party should uphold the President's profound intention to unify fundraising, prevent abuses, and rectify discipline. Anyone who has not been approved by the Executive Yuan and raises funds overseas without authorization should be frankly told by the fundraisers that they have received orders from the central government and it is inconvenient to assist them. At the same time, report to the Ministry. When the document arrives, I hope you will inform the leaders of the overseas Chinese groups. By order.</p>

<p>A resident of Shek O caught a big shark weighing 190 pounds in Shek O Bay yesterday. It is the largest shark caught in Hong Kong. The fish struggled fiercely during the lure, and it took two hours to drag it ashore. On the 24th of last month, Traffic Assistant Superintendent Saunders also caught a shark weighing 148 pounds, second only to the one caught yesterday. The next was the 137-pounder caught by Wong Kwok-cheung of the Sincere Company.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Ms. Liu Zhu-huang, the China Women's War Relief Association has spared no effort to raise funds and provide material assistance to the War of Resistance. The Association believes that the China Rescue Theatre's performances are excellent and caused a sensation in Hong Kong last time. It has taken advantage of their last performance before going abroad to invite them to perform one last time to raise funds for war refugees. The Theatre has agreed to perform famous plays such as "On the Banks of the Yongding River," "The Great Earth Robbery," and "Blood Splattered Peach Blossoms" at the Lee Theatre on July 1, 2, and 3, and to comfort the audience who missed the previous performance.</p>

<p>The Zhongshan youth who stayed in Hong Kong recently launched the Zhongshan Youth Association in order to connect their feelings and seek close ties with the youth in various parts of Zhongshan. The first preparatory meeting was convened yesterday and immediately elected Yang Zijiang, Yang Guoning, Fang Leibai, Xiao Yunlan, and other nine people as preparatory committee members to actively promote all matters. The preparatory office is temporarily located in the Student Newspaper Agency on the third floor of 371 Nathan Road.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Health Personnel The Number of Registrants is No More Than One Hundred Foreign Friends Are Still Helping Us What About Those Who Avoid Facing the Soldiers at the Front? <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong authorities have recently conducted wartime health personnel registration in various parts of the province and Hong Kong and Macau in order to adjust the health personnel and meet the needs of the wartime. All health personnel of Guangdong origin, such as physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, and midwives, whether or not they have obtained a business license, must register with the registration office in their place of residence. Otherwise, they may be requested to be punished by the Supreme Health Bureau or have their licenses revoked. The registration affairs in Hong Kong are handled by the China Youth Ambulance Corps. Registration has already begun and will end at the end of this month. It is understood that the Hong Kong registration office has received a total of 300 registration forms. It is estimated that the 300 forms will not be enough for the health personnel staying in Hong Kong. However, as of yesterday, less than half a month before the deadline, there are less than 100 registrants. According to Mr. Lu, the cadre in charge of registration, since the sacred War of Resistance, our compatriots at home and abroad have devoted themselves to the work of saving the country under the principle of our supreme leader contributing money and effort, and peace-loving friends have also used their spirit of loving peace to serve us, adding infinite glorious pages to the history of our War of Resistance and National Construction. But the health personnel who are registered this time are so weak. I don't know how to face the soldiers on the front line. We are following the instructions of the superiors to persuade people to register, and we will take the strictest measures against those who take a wait-and-see attitude or even refuse to register.</p>

<p>The China Motor Bus Company, in order to meet the needs of residents due to the failure of the original bus routes to supply, the company authorities are planning to open new routes and change the original bus routes. This plan has been approved by the Hong Kong government and will be implemented on July 1. The newly added Route 5A runs from Kennedy Town, via Queen's Road West, Leighton Hill Road, Wong Nai Chung Road, from which it turns past the Naval Memorial, turns back to Queen's Road East, and returns to Kennedy Town. The original "running line" between the Whampoa Dock and Happy Valley will be changed to run via Hennessy Road and Hon Ning Road into Happy Valley instead of Johnston Road. Route 2, which runs between the Whampoa Dock and Taikoo Dock, will also run via Hennessy Road instead of Lockhart Road in the future. According to Mr. Cheng Kun, the general manager of the company, the above-mentioned routes were decided by the company's board of directors last Friday night and will be implemented on July 1. It is said that it can be officially announced in about one or two days. It is also said that due to the sudden increase in the population of Hong Kong, the company feels that the original vehicles are not sufficient for distribution, and new vehicles have been purchased from foreign countries to join the fleet. It is estimated that the company has a total of 50 large buses with 35 to 37 seats, more than 30 medium-sized buses with 20 to 25 seats, and more than 20 other small buses. According to the situation observed a month ago, the current vehicles are still not enough. Recently, the company has ordered 12 new buses from foreign countries, half of which are large and medium-sized buses. After the buses arrive in Hong Kong, they will be dispatched to the crowded routes, and it is believed that the crowded situation can be reduced at that time.</p>

<p>Boat 4598, owned by boat housewife Li Qingmei (37 years old), sailed to the side of Fanliu Mountain Bay in British territory late at night the night before and stopped. There were five men and women on board. After mooring at the foot of the mountain, everyone slept in the boat. At about 2:00 am yesterday morning, just as everyone was having a good dream, four pirates suddenly sailed to the vicinity in a small boat. Taking advantage of everyone's sleeping soundly, they sneaked and climbed onto the boat. The boat owner, Li Qingmei, and everyone else were awakened one after another. The four pirates who boarded the boat were about 30 to 40 years old and wore short shirts and pants. Two of them carried short guns, and two carried kitchen knives. After boarding the boat, they didn't say a word. The thief with the gun fired two shots in a row, threatening everyone not to make a sound. The two companions, Feng Da and Feng Baoqi, were shot and injured on the spot. The people on the boat heard the gunshots and saw two people injured and falling to the ground, so they scrambled to escape. It was night, and the situation on the boat was very chaotic. Only the housewife, Li Qingmei, was strong and powerful. Seeing the two thieves shooting and committing murder, she was afraid that something unexpected would happen, so she rose up to resist, pounced forward and entangled with the thieves. The four thieves were caught off guard and were knocked down, twisting into a ball with each other. Li was superhuman in strength and finally pushed three of the thieves into the sea one after another. Seeing that the situation was not good, the remaining thief also jumped into the sea and fled. The four thieves swam to the original small boat and fled. The victim inspected the boat and fortunately there was no loss. She then took the kitchen knife and flashlight left behind by the thieves and took the injured to Tai O Police Station to report the case. After the police took the case, they sent the injured to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The graduation exams for overseas Chinese middle schools registered in the mainland for this academic year are scheduled to commence tomorrow and last fifteen days until the tenth of next month. They will be held in Hong Kong and overseen by supervisors dispatched by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education. It is noted that the practice of having Guangdong Education Department supervisors oversee the graduation exams of registered schools began three years ago. In the first two years, all participating students had to go to Guangzhou City for the exams. Last year, this was changed to holding the exams locally in Hong Kong, with supervisors Ma Yanpan and Zhu Baoqin dispatched by the Department of Education to oversee them. This year, the examination methods have been altered somewhat compared to last year. Last year, students went to designated examination halls to take the exams, overseen by Ma and Zhu. This year, all students will take the exams at their original schools, with supervisors dispatched by the Department of Education, Zhang Zimo, sending staff to the exam halls to oversee the exams. All invigilators will be university professors. It is also noted that the number of overseas Chinese schools participating in the exams this year, thirty-seven in total, has increased compared to last year.</p>

<h3 id="e65">New Tasks for Hong Kong's Young Theater Practitioners, Mr. Jin Shan's Speech at the Farewell Party of the Amateur Association <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— By Hu Qi, Recorded by Xian Zhuo</p>
<p>Starting from "Eating Zongzi"</p>
<p>Thank you for the kindness of the friends of the Amateur Association for holding such a meaningful gathering today. This deep friendship will be forever remembered by us —</p>
<p>Today happens to be the Dragon Boat Festival. It is indeed a rare opportunity for us to gather here and eat zongzi. On this day, according to the usual sentiments of us Chinese, we cannot help but feel "missing our loved ones more during festivals." I was deeply moved while silently eating zongzi just now, and my heart was filled with infinite emotion —</p>
<p>I am not missing my relatives. I am thinking, where will I be eating zongzi next year? And then I remembered the situation on this day last year.</p>
<p>Last year on the Dragon Boat Festival, we were in Wuhan, which was the time when we were intensifying the defense of Greater Wuhan. On the one hand, we participated in the defense of Wuhan, and on the other hand, we cooperated with the China Film Studio to shoot "The Last Drop of Blood." Because we were shooting outdoor scenes at East Lake in Wuchang, we ate zongzi at East Lake. At that time, I was thinking: "Where will I be eating zongzi next year?"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I am spending this year's Dragon Boat Festival in Hong Kong. Of course, I am not saddened by the loss of Wuhan, because the withdrawal from Wuhan was entirely a matter of overall strategy. The purpose of defending Wuhan was to deplete the enemy and exact a price. So defending Wuhan was only a matter of time. I am not only not saddened, but the development of the new situation of the war of resistance makes us even more excited and optimistic.</p>
<p>The facts tell us: the enemy today is making a final struggle in their dying days. The great victory in northern Hubei and the good news of counter-offensives on various fronts show how riddled with holes the enemy is, while we are showing ever-increasing strength and unlimited power to cope with the situation.</p>
<p>Kicked Out with One Foot</p>
<p>In order to cover up their military setbacks, the enemy has intensified their political conspiracies, using Wang Jingwei to organize puppet organizations, which is a prominent example. In fact, Wang Jingwei has long been kicked out by the compatriots of the whole country since he sent the scandalous telegram. Even if there were another Wang Jingwei, it would not affect our war of resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am very happy to be eating zongzi this year, because the progress of the motherland in the past year has been too great! Many backward elements are trembling in the face of the advancing motherland, many traitors are dying in the face of the advancing motherland, and the enemy is bound to collapse before it.</p>
<p>I believe that we are spending the Dragon Boat Festival in Hong Kong today, and next year today, we may be able to go to Guangzhou or Wuhan to eat zongzi. A year later, the motherland will definitely be more advanced than it is now. Therefore, the mood when eating zongzi next year will definitely be more genuine than this year!</p>
<p>Moreover, we must use all our strength to strive for this day, especially the salvation workers residing in Hong Kong. In the war-torn motherland, there is naturally no "Shangri-La." Today, in Hong Kong, where the international situation is becoming increasingly urgent, there can be no exceptions. The safety of Hong Kong is a big question mark, and our compatriots residing in Hong Kong should be vigilant about this!</p>
<p>The Price of Blood</p>
<p>I remember when I first met you, I said: How the youth in the war zone are struggling in a difficult and arduous environment! How they sacrifice everything and dedicate everything! Their contribution to the motherland is indelible, and they themselves have grown by leaps and bounds in their work! We worked with them in the war zone for twenty months and left a very deep impression. We will never forget them!</p>
<p>Recalling it in Hong Kong today, their work was really too difficult. Take the performance as an example. In Hong Kong, we can still use all the superior conditions on the stage to strengthen the performance effect, but in the war zone, there is nothing at all! Of course, in the war zone, it is not as in Hong Kong: the script must be submitted for review, but the most serious thing about submitting the script for review is only that the performance is banned. In the war zone, it is not a matter of "submission for review" at all, it is simply a matter of life and death. The young drama workers are constantly working under the threat of the enemy's cannons, planes, and bombs until they shed their last drop of blood. Speaking of this, I cannot help but think of Comrade Zhao Shu, who has already died for the country. He was brutally killed by the enemy when he broke through Xuzhou last year. He was still wearing the peasant's clothes he wore during the performance until his death. His death represents the new spirit of young drama workers. His death also shows that the foundation of the emerging drama has been laid as a result of countless hardships and the price of blood of countless young drama workers. And today, countless young drama workers are continuing Comrade Zhao Shu's spirit in the war zone and are making more arduous and greater struggles.</p>
<p>"Friend" and "Enemy"</p>
<p>Why are they able to fight so hard, risking their lives? The reason is very simple, because at that time, there were only two words in their minds: "friend" and "enemy." As soon as they opened their eyes, what was in front of them was the dying enemy, and around them were countless friends. Therefore, their problem was how to unite the friends around them closely, overthrow the enemy, and break through this life-and-death difficulty!</p>
<p>Such a situation is naturally not easy to demand in Hong Kong, but,</p>
<p>Therefore, we should be vigilant ourselves and forge ourselves as strong as steel to undertake today's work, cope with future problems, and actively participate in the struggle.</p>
<p>Speaking of ourselves, I can frankly tell you friends that we have many shortcomings. These shortcomings are constantly occurring in our work, but we are not afraid. We can say that we have been constantly overcoming our shortcomings since we started. Therefore, although we have shortcomings, we have never allowed our work to suffer a great impact.</p>
<p>Unite Sincerely</p>
<p>I am sorry that I do not have good suggestions to offer for your reference. As far as I can see, what is more important in the Hong Kong drama circle today is the issue of strengthening the solidarity movement.</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident, we have deeply realized the meaning of unity. We can say that without unity, there would be no war of resistance, and without unity, we would not be qualified to fight the enemy.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, there are many drama comrades whose performance in their work makes us very admire. If we make more efforts to strengthen the power of unity, I believe their contribution must be more significant!</p>
<p>Naturally, every department of salvation work must be closely united; however, it must be a sincere unity in order to generate power! Empty slogans of unity will not have any results. We are actors, and every actor has experienced using various expressions to impress the audience, so actors are also best able to distinguish between true and false. From the other party's voice, expression, and actions, we can tell whether they are true or false. It is not easy to deceive an actor or anyone with empty slogans; similarly, genuine sincerity and genuine frankness are also easy to see. We do not have excessively high expectations, as long as all those who sincerely cooperate can be closely united, it is already a great force!</p>
<p>Learn from Practice</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that each of us should strengthen our self-education. The War of Resistance and National Reconstruction are progressing simultaneously. Once the War of Resistance ends, all the construction work after the great destruction will be very arduous and very urgent. The first step must be to mobilize all workers in the cultural sector to work hard to eliminate illiteracy. Drama is an important part of culture. We must use drama as a tool to educate the masses. To take on the arduous tasks of the future, we should first educate ourselves and enrich ourselves.</p>
<p>Strengthening self-education naturally includes academic cultivation and personality training. I firmly believe that the drama workers staying in Hong Kong have already noticed this problem. However, learning has no end, and we all need to continue learning. I sincerely tell all my friends that I often feel that I am very insufficient, so I often try hard not to give up every opportunity to learn. We should learn from each other and educate each other. Who can say that they do not need to learn? Absolutely not! But who should we learn from? I think learning from each other is a method, but at the same time, it is important to pay attention to learning in practice - learning in work. Friends, I think this is the best and most reliable method.</p>
<p>Hoping to be Younger Next Year</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about another thing, which is the issue of the view of the term "young drama worker." I think that the youth referred to here should not be understood formally, thinking that those who are young are young, nor should we simply think that those who have performed in dramas for many years, engaged in drama movements for many years, and have many years of stage experience are considered young. I feel that the meaning of youth should refer to those who have rich vitality, strong fighting spirit, high enthusiasm, and can represent a new hope, a new spirit, and a new force. Such fighters are worthy of being called youth!</p>
<p>I am ashamed that I am not qualified to be called "youth." None of the comrades in our group are really worthy of being called "youth," because we have too many shortcomings! Of course, we can overcome our shortcomings, but as long as the shortcomings exist for one day, we cannot be considered youth for one day.</p>
<p>We must respond to the encouragement and expectations of many friends and hope to be a little younger than this year next year. At the same time, we hope that when we gather together in another place next year, there will be more youth present than today!</p>
<p>The words of the younger brother are complicated, but they are all sincere. That's all!</p>

<p>Stills from "Before Dawn": "Thief," a performance by China Rescue.</p>
<p>To raise funds for the good cause of donating to the cultural undertakings of the motherland, Hong Kong's remaining drama people will hold a joint charity performance on the 16th and 17th of this month. Participants include: China Arts, China Travel, China Rescue, etc. Details were published in the previous issue of this publication. The following stills were not available for electroplating in time for the previous issue, and are specially published in this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e66">"China Rescue," See You Again in Work! <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Various Circles of Relief Joint Association and Amateur Association Present Flags and Farewell Before Departure</p>
<p>In order to express their appreciation and encouragement, the Hong Kong Relief Joint Association, together with various overseas Chinese groups, held a meeting at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on the 20th, a very hot afternoon, to bid farewell to the "China Rescue" drama troupe before their departure to promote the cause abroad. A flag presentation ceremony was held, and an atmosphere of harmony and tension enveloped the entire venue.</p>
<p>The hosts participating in the farewell included representatives from various circles of the Relief Joint Association, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Journalists Association, the Women's War Relief Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's New Movement Association, the Chung Sing Charitable Society, the Tung Wah Hospital, the Kwong Lien Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations. After refreshments, Chairman Li Jianfeng, Huang Zhaoruolan, Cao Xueyu, Lu Guomian, and others successively delivered speeches, praising and encouraging the troupe's work performance and the service spirit of the members. Then, the flag presentation ceremony was held. The Relief Joint Association presented a flag with the words "Preaching by Example"; the Journalists Association presented a flag with the words "Winning Hearts Is Paramount"; Li Jianfeng personally presented a flag with the words "Verbal Condemnation," each with profound implications, for mutual encouragement.</p>
<p>The next day, the evening of the 21st - the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival - there was another potluck farewell party at the Oriental Vegetarian Restaurant in Wan Chai, appearing in a lively and solemn posture. The host was the Amateur Association, which is eager to learn from the virtuous and follow good advice. Such a rare gathering was not accidental.</p>
<p>In addition to the "China Rescue" troupe members and the "Amateur Association" community, there were also senior figures in the drama circle participating. About a hundred young people with surging blood were tightly surrounded by a not very large dining hall. The electric fans overhead were spinning non-stop, making people forget the suffering of the heat.</p>
<p>First of all, Chairman Yao Jianhou gave a speech. Although he has worked in the banking industry for many years, his words were filled with youthful activity. Many friends of the Amateur Association are also this type of respectable figure.</p>
<p>He said that sending China Rescue friends to promote the cause abroad is like sending fighters to the battlefield. The commendable qualities of China Rescue that are worth learning from us are, first, a high degree of enthusiasm ××××××××, second, tense work, carrying heavy burdens, third, a simple and strict private life; fourth, a spirit of love, harmony, and unity in the group - these are completely symbols of the new China.</p>
<p>As for the contributions of China Rescue after arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Yao said: hard work has led to great rewards, overseas Chinese understand the great motherland from drama and are convinced of the future of victory, as for improving the level of drama in Hong Kong and giving new inspiration and encouragement to national defense dramas, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao also contributed that China Rescue should make overseas Chinese: 1. Thoroughly understand the rebirth of the motherland and be absolutely confident in the final victory; 2. Mobilize the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of overseas Chinese to participate in the motherland's ××××××; 3. Crush the surrender theories of traitors and defeatists; 4. Organize overseas Chinese to work hard to strengthen the national diplomacy movement and win the sympathy of friendly countries.</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman solemnly said that this farewell party, in addition to eating and socializing, should launch group research to make the harvest more substantial and beneficial to future work. In order to promote the spirit of China Rescue and fill their posts, we will take "the responsibilities that the remaining workers of the China Salvation Troupe should bear" as the focus of the symposium?</p>
<p>In a burst of warm applause, Mr. Weng Lingwen presented a banner with the words "Propaganda for the Country" on behalf of the Amateur Association, which was accepted by Jin Shan, the head of the China Rescue Troupe. After that, guests and friends present contributed their opinions at the invitation of the chairman.</p>
<p>Lu Fu first spoke: "China Rescue's" past heroic work and activities in Hong Kong for more than two months have deeply moved each of our cultural workers! In their continuous efforts, they have opened up a bright future for the emerging drama movement in China and established the foundation of the new national drama. During the short period of working with them, I deeply felt that they had several special advantages that are worth learning from us: 1. A serious and thorough work attitude and a working spirit of sacrificing everything for the liberation of the nation; 2. A strong willpower and a high degree of enthusiasm of being indomitable, courageous, hardworking, honest, and sincere; 3. A close, solid, and democratic organization and strict work discipline; 4. Diligent and tireless self-education and a hard-working struggle life. ... Now, they are carrying the more great and arduous task of promoting the cause overseas. They are the pioneers of national liberation. How should we, who are left in this "Shangri-La," work harder to be their support, to learn their spirit, to fill their posts, to expand their work, and to shoulder the new tasks we should bear!</p>
<p>Li Jingbo said: Thank you to China Rescue for giving excitement to overseas Chinese and drama workers. Since China Travel came to Hong Kong, the high tide of the drama movement has surged. It will not come in vain.</p>
<p>I dare to solemnly say to China Rescue friends on behalf of the young drama workers in Hong Kong: You will not come in vain; the seeds you have sown will sprout and bear fruit. — A hardworking and excellent young drama worker, with a naive and sincere attitude, made people very moved.</p>
<p>Jiang Ming's speech was as humorous, vivid, and interesting as he was on stage. After everyone had a hearty vegetarian meal - and zongzi - many more people continued to speak:</p>
<p>Weng Lingwen reported on China Rescue's hard life of sleeping on the floor and eating coarse food, and its indomitable spirit of hard work, and said that helping China Rescue perform was as inspiring as studying at China Rescue. This young man, who is keen to learn, was originally a cadre sent by the Ministry of Education to Hong Kong to promote the Mandarin movement and is now a Mandarin teacher at a certain middle school in Hong Kong and an excellent member of the Amateur Association.</p>
<p>China Rescue Liu Danqing said in a scholar's manner: To make the liberation movement of the people win, the ancient national spirit should be fundamentally liberated. The level of civilization between urban and rural areas is non-uniformly rugged; as for Hong Kong, it has also progressed much more than before. I hope that the Amateur Association, China Flag, China Arts, and other groups will advance side by side.</p>
<p>In order to be able to communicate with each other and encourage each other after China Rescue goes abroad, Jiang Ming proposed that the film and drama weekly of this newspaper be used as a communication station, which was applauded by everyone. The editor-in-chief, Lu Fu, officially expressed his determination to do his best to shoulder this task.</p>
<p>After Fan Zheng and Wu Weigeng, Wang Ying also gave a very gentle and amiable speech. She said: It is a rare memory to eat zongzi here today on the Dragon Boat Festival. We are very excited and grateful for the praise, hope, encouragement, and enthusiasm of our friends. The precious friendship is also what supports our work everywhere. We still have many shortcomings ourselves. For the past two years, we have been constantly overcoming them. I hope you will continue to help us overcome our shortcomings.</p>
<p>Finally, Jin Shan gave a speech. The sincere attitude, the powerful, and life-filled performance of the speech captured the attention of everyone. In particular, the hope that drama workers will unite as one and strengthen self-education resonated with every person who has a heart. (Full text will be recorded separately)</p>
<p>After the chairman made a conclusion, Liu Ying, a famous singer, led the singing, and then they reluctantly parted ways. The right-minded drama troupe of the public office organization performed on the evening of May 30th for four consecutive nights. The first night was to entertain various agencies and groups, the second night was to entertain students, the third night was to entertain the armed comrades, and the fourth night was to entertain the masses. This time, the ambition was to use the collective directing method to mobilize drama talents from several counties to perform, spending more than 400 yuan in national currency, which was an unprecedented feat!</p>
<p>In terms of actors, there were several successful ones, and there was no one better than him locally, Huang Jingwen who played Miao Kexiu, Fu Ruyu who played Zhang Sheng, Lai Shiying who played Huang Lao Shuai, Zheng Songxi who played Liu Fangdan, and Li Muzhen who played Kikuko. There were also several others who were good.</p>
<p>Their future work plan is to be able to perform a multi-act play once a month and be able to go to the countryside to perform more one-act plays, so that the drama movement in Gaozhou Six is improved, so that this kind of appropriate propaganda can be combined with the present and increase the strength of the war of resistance. A recent news is that the Nongzhong School is rehearsing "Black Hell" and wants to be able to perform it soon.</p>
<p>On the second day after the performance, people from all walks of life were publicly invited to criticize, and the results obtained were:</p>
<p>In terms of scenery, the first act was the best, the second and third acts had small flaws, and the fourth act was also good.</p>
<p>In terms of lighting, the reason why there was no electric light, so lighting could not be talked about</p>
<p>In terms of makeup, although there were many successful ones, some of them were too exaggerated</p>
<p>In terms of effect, they were all quite flexible.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Drama Movement in the South Road <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Min Da</p>
<p>Gaozhou is the cultural center of the South Road, so the new drama movement is easy to develop, because the average young people are very interested in this kind of work. The performance place, wherever it is great, is all performed in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall of the Maoming County Party Department. It has developed from one-act plays to multi-act plays. It began to perform in April of this year, "Spring Breeze Autumn Rain." Gaozhou Middle School classmates raised donations to comfort the征军men, and the director was Mr. Qu Xucai, a former member of the Blue and White Drama Group. The audience was about 1,500 people, and the results were not bad. The second performance "The Night Before" was for the township propaganda fund of the Mao Ge Party Department Guangnan War Work Troupe. The audience was about 1,000 people. Because of technical and various difficulties, the result was not very good. The third time was by the Seventh District Commissioner.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Raising Funds for the Women's War Relief Association, China Rescue's Farewell Charity Performance Before Departure <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Repertoire: Yongding River, Great Earth Tribulation, Blood Splattered Peach Blossom</p>
<p>"China Rescue" is about to go abroad for propaganda, and it is now specially invited by the Women's War Relief Association to decide to hold the 746th farewell charity performance before going abroad at the Lee Theatre Grand Theater on July 123. This is the last performance of "China Rescue" in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The program for this performance is the three great famous dramas "Yongding River", "Great Earth Tribulation" and "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom".</p>
<p>"Yongding River" is a collective creation of the National Playwrights Association in July of the year before last. The original play is divided into three acts. After several performances by "China Rescue," it has been revised, and a "Prologue" has been added to make it more complete. The whole play is tense and enthusiastic, and the scenery and lighting are unprecedented.</p>
<p>"Great Earth Tribulation" is four independent plays. As the name suggests, it can be known that it is a national defense story masterpiece that has been tempered thousands of times. "China Rescue's" "Defend the Motherland" has moved many audiences in Hong Kong, and "Great Earth Tribulation" is more refined and compact, and it will definitely tell the audience more touching stories.</p>
<p>The heroic and enthusiastic and great "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom" has been known to the audience, and there is no need for the reporter to introduce it.</p>
<p>For this performance of "China Rescue," all the scenery, lighting, props, and costumes were specially made for these plays. In addition to the thousands of yuan that had been prepared for the previous performance, more than a thousand yuan have now been specially added, and its greatness and richness goes without saying.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese who want to watch "China Rescue's" plays, this is the last opportunity to appreciate them. For the compatriots who missed it last time, this is an even rarer opportunity. Missing this time will be a permanent regret that can no longer be made up for.</p>
<h3 id="e69">How to Solve the Script Shortage <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiwei</p>
<p>The script shortage is a serious problem currently existing in the theater world. This problem should have been raised long ago, but it has not been resolved to this day.</p>
<p>Theater takes reflecting reality as its primary task. When the War of Resistance Against Japan has been going on for more than twenty-two months, and countless heroic soldiers and people are defending the motherland with their flesh and blood every day, it is truly a pity that the theater world is still suffering from a script shortage.</p>
<p>This problem needs to be discussed from two aspects. In terms of "quantity," we need to examine whether there are now a large number of scripts sufficient for numerous theater troupes to perform. In terms of "quality," we also need to examine whether these produced scripts have correct content that can meet the needs of the War of Resistance; and the latter is more important than the former, because theater cannot exist independently of reality.</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, I don't think it's very serious. Since the War of Resistance, quite a few plays have been produced. In various books and newspapers, one or two plays can be seen in almost every issue. But unfortunately, most of these works are only regarded as "bonsai" to be appreciated, and difficulties inevitably arise when they are actually staged. Therefore, after much deliberation, only a few old plays are still frequently performed in various places, and very few new scripts have been discovered, which is really frustrating.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for this: First, the authors lack creative experience and have clumsy skills, and are not familiar with stage conditions. Some works, although they can be read as good literary works, neglect the characteristics of drama, resulting in a confusion between literature and drama. In this regard, we should ask authors to pay special attention to careful research. Drama is a visualized comprehensive art with unique qualities that cannot be neglected in the slightest. Second, the authors lack life experience, so what is reflected in the works is the monotony of the subject matter, and they fall into formulaic and abstract patterns. For example, in the current theater, the most popular story to describe is that of guerrilla teams. Of course, we do not deny that guerrilla warfare is being widely carried out today, and it does play an important role in the War of Resistance, and it is indeed worthy of our depiction, but the problem lies in the fact that the emergence of guerrilla teams is by no means transformed according to a single form. It has various and different changes, but what we can see now are all things that revolve around one plot, nothing more than a certain Japanese soldier insulting or massacring the Chinese people, arousing everyone's indignation, so they can't bear it any longer and unite to kill this Japanese soldier, and then go to fight guerrillas together. This kind of cliché style not only obliterates the authenticity of the guerrilla teams, but also reduces their power, making people suspect that "guerrilla teams are just this one thing." Even from the perspective of the drama itself, it is enough to reduce the effect. Because the impression given to the audience is a vague thing, and because the faces of A and B are no different, they are too lazy to watch it a second time. Therefore, we must oppose this trend, because drama is definitely not just a profile without a mouth or eyes, it is definitely not just a shell without a soul. Drama must delicately describe the lines of every fact in reality, so that the masses can recognize it, understand it, and make them nod and sigh, to the point where they have to draw their swords and attack, this is the full responsibility of drama.</p>
<p>How can we achieve this? First of all, we must ask playwrights to never rely on their own fantasies, or pick up some hearsay, to write about the subject matter, because this is the biggest root cause of formulaization and abstraction. You can never understand the cruelty of war if you don't go to the front line. Listening to air raid sirens in Hong Kong and listening to air raid sirens in the mainland are psychologically different. It is a foolish act for an author to try to take shortcuts in this regard. The author must be able to jump into this great torrent and experience it in practice, in order to discover many new materials, and be able to contact a wider range of reality, then he can not suffer from poverty, not fall into the "old routine," and create countless new roads, and his works will undoubtedly be the most capable of grasping reality, and the most powerful masterpieces of reflecting it.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is being carried out fiercely, this problem should be resolved as soon as possible, not only to relieve the worries of theater workers themselves. And millions of viewers are also eagerly looking forward to the emergence of more excellent works!</p>
