<h3>抗戰一年半後太平洋上的新形勢</h3>
<p>— 王紀元</p>
<p>中國的抗日戰爭，不單是全中華民族爲求自身的獨立，自由發展的戰爭，也是維護太平洋上陸際和益關係均衡的戰爭·換句話說·抗日的戰爭，一方面固然爲了中國自身的最後生存·而另一方面·也替在華東有利益關係的歐美列強·盡了一魔犬的任務·這是全世界愛好和平，具有公正頭腦的國際政論家的一　共有的認識。</p>
<p>抗戰經過了一年半以後，事實證明了這一觀察的正確性。目前，第一國家在遠中大陸的廣大市　與現成的廣大利益，雖然無端地遭受了日本　　內控制，無端地遭受了日本軍閥的征取與摧殘，然而，我們若用史尖銳更遠大的眼光來分析，我們可以說，新的列強在遠東的組織力，正不斷在發展中，強大中，而有的日本在太平洋，在遠東大陸的一切勢力，則不斷地走上了衰落，削弱的過程。東方的　子手——日×·這就是今日所造成的太平洋上新的形勢，新的秩序。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>這個新形勢的基本特質，就是中國抗戰力量的不斷增強，而×的損失則極端慘重。</p>
<p>據我最高領袖蔣委員長的報告，在這一年半中，我們的實力，增強了三十倍，我們的以保持二百五十國防師爲標凖的軍隊編制，大致業已就緒，且包含了許多新的機械化的部隊，並目在經濟建設政治設施，文化工作，外交運用以及戰略之應用上，部建立了長期在戰的穩定基礎。不但財政和國政軍需品的接濟方面，可以有「柳暗花明」的踵徑，而中作政治權橫內的妥協勢力，亦漸漸的置跡海外，陣綫愈固，而抗×的力量亦愈集中。</p>
<p>反之·我們視察日×的內部·卻已充分暴露著左支右絀，進退爲難的狀態，兵力的動員已達其全部兵源的三分之二（約百五十萬），傷亡的人數，已達六十萬左飛右，機的損失約遠其全部機數的四分之一，（約六百餘架）·海軍的損失，雖較爲微小，但大小軍艦合　，亦在自艘以上。財政方面，更有捉襟見肘之象，國民收入的半數以上，已被×軍閥搜括作爲支持對華的戰費之用，貨幣凖備率已減低到二成半，物價平均增高三成至六成半。舊有的軍需品，亦已消耗幾盡，不得不以信用狀四出收買廢銅爛鐵。趕造新貨，以資接濟。日本一般老成持重的元老重臣，見了此種情形之發展，只有啞然不語。而厭戰與反戰之思漸與運動，則普遍深人于民間，任憑日本軍閥的欵鷄多麼高明，任憑日本軍閥和用日皇的勒令，迫議會通過一切戰時法案，然而，它的內潰之象，已顯然暴露了！【未完】</p>
<h3>第一期抗戰的總結與第二期抗戰的前瞻（二）</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>（續昨日第七版）</p>
<p>第二，是加菽民衆運動與軍隊中的政治工作，已由第八路軍的優良的影響，而普遍到五路軍以及其他中央各部隊去。員現在軍事委會下面已有政治部，各軍師團亦先後成立政治部，而民衆動員委會民衆訓練部的設立，對抗戰尤其盡了不少助力，第三，武裝民衆運動開始在，廿寗邊區，晉察冀涉區和廣西而若干地方實現，抗日游戲戰爭亦在全國各淪陷地區開始發展，持別是華北抗日根據地晉至冀邊區，晉西北和冀魯邊抗日人民政府的成立，江南方面也有軍委會忠義救國軍和新四軍的合作刪立蘇浙皖邊抗日游擊根據地等，而且這些地方人民抗日政權與游擊部隊，已先後和中央取得較密切的聯擊。其次，在</p>
<p>政治方面</p>
<p>第一是我們最高當局與全國愛國民衆，一次再次地紛碎了南京失陷徐州失陷以至粵漢築守以後由×奸■動的和平妥置外國調解的陰謀，更加堅強了團結一致抗日到底的決心。×人以挑別離間分裂中國破壞抗戰達到速戰速決征服中華的計劃受到極大的打擊第二是抗日民族戰綫更加鞏固與擴大了！主要是全國最大政黨國民黨共產黨的正式親密合作。繼之又有第三黨。國家主義青年黨。和國家社會黨等在「抗日政黨聯合」的大旗下先後攜手臺作起來，而對於發動國內團結共禦外侮首先切實努力而終於生效的救國會諸領袖，均分別在政府機構內或在民衆運動中或在與論界繼續努力。他們始終沒有離開民衆—第三，是政治機構開始爲適應抗戰需要而改造了—在一九三八年元旦的前夕，中央政府就已舉行部分的改組與人員調動。一面裁併駢體機關，如鐵道交通兩部的合併，經建兩委會的併入實部，裁併空開衙署如海軍部。一而建立民衆訓練部。而共產黨領袖毛澤東。朱德。周恩來。彭德懷等、則加入車事委員會爲委員。接著在國防多議會內增加了七十五個名額，容納各黨派，蒙藏各屬及華僑代表參加。此外抗戰後新設的經濟部政治部社會部，也先後有工作爲中外所共許。而各省市地方政治機構，也有鄂湘等若十地方的改善。第四，是國民黨在羣衆中的威信大大的提高了，尤其是一九三八年四月的臨時全國代表大會，決定設立總裁制，擁舉蔣介石先生爲該黨總裁同，決議成立青年團、流一全國青年運動，國民黨開始向健全之路邁進了。特別是製定抗戰建國綱領。作爲國民政府抗戰時期的施政方針，獲得全國羣衆的　護。第五，是各抗日黨派尤其是共產黨，在羣衆中的威信亦日益強大，共產黨在所有淪陷地區　不怕危難，與國民黨同志密切合作奮門，建立抗日政權，破壞，僞統治及其開發工作，卓著成績。第六，是民意機關之雛形的國民參政會的建立與召開大會。特別是七月六日起開幕到十六日結束的第一次大會，它代表四萬萬五千萬同胞，又一次確定了「抗戰到底，爭取國家民族最後勝利」的國策，宣佈了「各黨各派各界合作的抗日民族統一戰綫」的方針，「共同在最高統帥蔣委員長領導之下，努力奮門，以取得最後，勝利，而達到建國之成功」，在社會和經濟方面，如救濟難民，救濟失業失學，金融的穩定，財政的鞏固，東南人力物力的西移，西部經濟交通建設的發展，經過十六個月的抗戰，都已有相當的成就，最在</p>
<p>（國際關係）</p>
<p>上，也已　了相當的努力，首先是由於中國抗日民族戰綫的鞏固，由於中國政府及最高當局持久抗戰決心的堅強，由於中國軍民一致的英勇抗戰反對分裂反對調解反對　協，大大增加了國際對我的同情與援助，蘇聯全國的同情與物質上軍事人材上的援手不必說了，英美法等國的民衆更在經濟援助上難民救濟上抵制日貨上不斷努力，而國聯大會更接受我國的提案，並一致決議援用盟約十六條，請各國自動援助中國制裁日本侵略者不過我們在第一期抗戰十六個月中的成就與進事　還不能適應爭求抗戰　到　更大要求，而且犯過極　　錯誤，並還遣留　許多</p>
<p>缺點</p>
<p>特別重要的在軍事上，是（一）前綫戰門力與一切配備的不夠；（未完）</p>

<h3>蔣委員長訓話原文（續三十日第七版）</h3>
<p>既要縛手足，扼血脈，還要，中國跟著他背信蔑義，助成他獨覇東亞，以至支配世界的迷夢，試問：我們中國立國五千年，向以信義爲立國的基礎，豈肯受他威脅而拋棄我們的立塲嗎？我們中國的立國精神，就是不侮鰥寡，不長強暴，尤其是不肯背盟棄信，及破壞相與維擊的止義，曾記得民國初年，田中義一到上海曾見我們的總理，那時節正是歐戰發生時間。田中說：「我們東亞應該擺脫一切與外國既成關係，而別造一個新體勢。」總理就問他：「這樣豈不要破壞國際條約丫」田中說：「破壞國際條約，打破不平等關係，不是于中國很有利益嗎？」總理毅然回絕他道：「廢除不平等條約，也要堂堂正正，依合法的正當手續來做：如果不合法的破壞條約，這種舉動，雖于我國有利，亦所不爲。」</p>
<p>諸位同志，這就是中國的精神，這就是三民主義的精神。我們照這個精神來抗戰，我們憑這個精神來抵抗一切罰道強權和暴力，我們更要憑道個精神來恢復東亞秩序，以貢獻千世界永久的和平。</p>
<p>總之，這」回戰爭，在日本是精神道德整個崩潰沒落的暴力橫行，在我們毅然擔起世界正義責任的義戰。日本現在的軍閥，正是失了理智，逞其獸性，奔驛馳突，可以衝破一切軌範，摧毀人類的一切文明與福社，本來世界上負有條約責任的各國，要打開黑暗，重復光明，都應該有制裁強暴，維持國際條約的責任；但大家都用顧逡巡，中國就祇有不惜一切犧牲，來擔起了這個正義絕績，公理存亡關頭的大責任，我們這一次抗戰，在本國是求完成國民革命的目的。求得中國的獨立自由平等；在國際就是要擁護正義，恢復條約尊嚴，重建和平秩序。我們這一次抗×戰事，是善與惡，是與非的戰爭日是公理與強權的戰爭—是守法和設法的戰爭；也是正義和暴力的戰爭。我們古語有云：一德不孤，必有隣，」世上公理的力量，終必抬頭，一切良善的人類，終必爲正義而合作，我們只要一定立　，認目定標，立定決心，愈懇苦愈堅強，愈持久，愈奮勇；全國一心，繼續努力，最後勝利，必屬我們，希望我戰們同志和全國軍民，格外黽勉，以底於成。</p>
<h3>抗戰以來之交通設施中</h3>
<p>— 交通部長　張嘉璈</p>
<p>（二）公路</p>
<p>公路運輸，於鐵路淪陷以後，更見迫切需要。本部隨戰事之發展，增修各主要幹綫，計抗戰以前所築公路，自民國二十年迄二十六年，共成十一萬公里；抗戰以後，自二十六年八月至二十七三月，計由中央專案撥欵興築之最急公路：有冀晉及蘇豫皖北部之公路，如海州鄭州開封湯陰太原大同等路十餘綫，共一千五百餘公里，其他由軍事機關逕交省方自築者，尚不在內。例如：江蘇一省，於戰事發生前，早將幹綫完成，但上海戰事發生，戰區支路及沿江及皖南方面，亦臨時增築公甚多；又西北方面新增之路綫，計六百餘公里，尚有由本部擔任一部份經費督造完成可通車者，共三千二百餘公里。至於各路之沿綫修車廠，車站，無缐電臺，電話等設備，亦經陸續添設，並籌設汽車配件製造廠，以利運輸。</p>
<p>今後公路方面設施，最重要者，爲西南西北兩公路系統，西南各省重要公路，現已由本部西南公路運輸管理局分別接管，先後通車。西北方面，則有西北公路運輸管理局，將原有西北各省公路工程及運輸管理事項。統歸管轄，以一事權，關於司機之訓練，油料之節省，汽車之修理，亦均由該局等詳練計劃，嚴加規定，切實改善，以充實西南西北各省之公路運輸。</p>
<p>公路運輸，溝通國際路綫之最重要者，爲滇編公路；自昆明通續甸之　戍，共長九百六十四公里，自二十六年底開工，微工十萬人，費十月之久，開始通車，再本部以今後方運輸，可採用人工畜力，經營貨運，促進出口貿易增益外匯基金；特設歇運管理所，辦理此導運輸，現先行設立敘昆入路歇運管理所，從該路著手辦理，估計該路每日運輸數量，可逐晰增至一百噸。視施行成績，再推行於川黔黔桂等路，舉辦各該路歇運，以應時需，而充國力。</p>
<p>（三）航政</p>
<p>水道交通，因船舶缺乏，運輸極或困難。戰車發生，本部爲實施江陰，黃埔口，　江口，鎮海，海州，珠江口及馬當一帶封銷阻塞工事，廢充沈沒之輪船，爲數甚多，航運工具，因之益感不敷。計沉沒之輪船，共九十九總，約達十四萬噸，其中屬於招商局者十四艘，計二萬零五百十九噸。</p>
<p>關於戰時水道運輸，本部爲統籌支配集中運用起見，一面由招商局及各民營航業機關，合組長江業聯合辦事處，辦理江海各輸之軍事征用及客貨支配事宜。一面令飭各商埠航政局成立內河航業聯合辦事處，統制各該轄境之內河小輸，施行以來，極有成效。其中最著者，厥爲長江航缐，粵漢聯運航缐，及湘省航缐三項，茲分述如左：</p>
<p>（一）長江航缐　長江航運，可分爲兩期：（甲）第一期　自一月至五月半止，集中各段之船舶，計一、集中宜建洪輪船漢宜枯水輪船十四瑜於漢宜段；二、集中宜瑜洪輸船漢宜枯水輸船十四獲於漢宜段；二、集中宜瑜枯水船輸十一艘於宜萬段；三、集中斜渝輪船八艘於萬渝段；四、集中木船二百餘艘於宜諭段。本期運輸成績，約計統散人口在五萬人以上，蓮輸兵工器材兩萬噸以上，運輸公物民營遷廠器材及液體燃料兩萬噸共計四萬噸。</p>
<p>（乙）第二期　自五月半起至現在止，集中各段之船舶，計（一）集中江海輸船十六時以上於漢宜段，（二）集中川江輪船十七艘於宜　段，逐漸集中一部份輪船於宜漢段，最近復逐集中一部份小輪於宜昌奉節及宜昌巴東間；（三）集中木船七百餘艘於宜諭宜萬段，本期運輸成績，約計疏散人口十萬人以上，運輸軍品及兵工器材九萬噸，運公物民營遷廠器材五萬噸，計共逾七萬噸。</p>
<p>（二）粵漢聯運航綫此綫分三段聯運漢口，長沙，衡陽間利用水路，長沙衡陽曲江間利用鐵路，曲江廣州間利用水路，計（一）集中江輪四請於漢長間，（二）集中北江拖輪我船於廣州曲江間，（三）集中淺水輪船駁船於長沙衡陽間，此綫運輸成績，計疏運人口五萬以上，出口聯運貨物五千餘噸，聯運內銷貨物六千餘噸。</p>
<p>（三）湘省航綫　分爲漢口常德及長沙常德兩綫，計集中小學江輪及江浙拖輪三十餘艘，駁船百餘里，此綫運輸成績，除人口不計外，共運兵工及遷移器材五萬噸以上。</p>
<h3>斥汪兆銘</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>讀過汪氏精衛艷目通電，我覺得這對干國家民族倒是好現象。因爲這證明兩件事。第一，主相派的主張原來如此。可是其別有心肝，老早和全黨同志及領導政府的意見與圖二完全相反，卻簡直成爲「善耶友邦」之「傳音機」了。以前閃閃縮編的那些什麼「我的意見，就是政府全體同志的意見，蔣先生的意見」之屬就可見全是欺人之談，並無一點「老實話」，而只是他一個人的意見。現在完全暴露出來了。第二，不肯他有多大本領，現在抗戰十八月以來，躱在我國抗戰中樞，進行種種活動，不晰「深思遠慮」他那一套「中日邦交根本方針之　中」，幸而政府絲毫不為動搖，迫至他無所施其技而終於悄然出走，目見我政府的抗戰決心之堅強，全國軍民團結之致，與乎年來抗戰中各方面偉大，進步。從此陣缐分明，亡國之德意路缐投降諭者，失其憑藉，我國抗戰前途自史光芒萬丈，全國同應由是更可了然於心，×友之界限既明，抗戰之信念益堅，自必百折不屈，戰鬬到最後勝利，此香凝所雀躍三百，願馨香爲民族前途祝福者也。</p>
<p>然而爲著三十年來曾共患難的友情，爲忠實於先總理臨終時大家所說的話，我很希望這個通電是他坐飛機時北風吹昏了頭，或是肝里的瓜子蟲扒進了心坎的胡里胡塗，而不是神志清楚，幾經「熟慮」後的老實話：因爲這太不像中國人講的誌了。總理遣囑還是水氏親筆所紀錄的，事過十餘年，言猶在耳，如今汪氏竟觀顏事×，不知而以對總埋及殉國諸烈士，數萬抗戰之戰士及已被殘殺同胞？倘我一片熱心，假定他是病得發狂的是真的話，那麼汪氏應立即重發聲明，取消一切前所胡說的不入耳之談。重回四川，閉門思過。以謝國人並求組宗之寛容。否則汪先生自已講過哩：做帝國主義走狗不是「反共黨」三字所掩埋得過去的哩……</p>
<p>其實汪氏通電，其所提議各點，措詞恍忽，均只從如何執行「日本政府所提誤者」出發，將近衛聲明響應一番，不特民族氣味全無，連做人的良心都已喪失，原不必一一斥緊，但爲退一步想，且來看看其綱領如何，其要點如何：</p>
<p>（一）承認日人在中國內地各處「自由」（即毫不能有任何行政法律上限制）「居住」（收實土地）「營業」（搜取我國資源）之權，換一句話，即凖備　此「著隣友邦」水銀瀉地般侵入所有中國領土。這樣一來，日本目不必再有租界領事，橫直不是全中國都已成殖民區域？</p>
<p>（二）共同防共，即將全中國的行政警察之槍，交給日本，這哩要明白，德國意大利兩國具是××之邦，各人俱有槍有砲，是以「共同防共」，自無法干預對方內政，可是中國老早是半殖民地，像你這機靦顏求和，焉有「不干內政」之理？想將中國內政事事行政拱手送人，也不是這等說他的呀！這真我完全同意蔣先生說的話，所謂「防共」就是減華，實在再沒有其他的解釋。共同防共。實際上是請人減華而已。</p>
<p>（三）所謂經濟提攜，那就真是「談也談不上」。連英美的「門戶開放」都打得粉碎的現在，置許你們這些半殖民地奴才去「提攜」。</p>
<p>（四）關于　兵問題請問你有何辦法，除了用長期抗戰來逐×人出境之外—什麼叫做在「防共協定期間內在特定地點允許駐兵，並至多以內蒙附近之地點爲限」？你簽定淞滬協定，塘沽協定，還以爲未足，再想將華北五省無條件給人一帆風順併入「滿州國」版圖？如何去限定「至多」？倘若人家將你「爲限」，做限的時候忠樣辦？難道一日本政府提議者」你就非執行不可，而中國人民提議的意見對于閣下就如此不直堂笑麼？鳴呼，六年前窗聞人稱，你在南京大發議論，謂「細細想來，秦槍算不得漢奸。」想不到今天真步姓案的後　—</p>
<p>然而我最寒心的，倒不是這些荒謬之談。凡是有良心有血氣的前帝子孫，這樣東話都是聽不入耳的。我認爲最危險的，倒是這篇文章中透露出很利害的陰謀，要人家嚴密注意。這是什麼？就是第一，文章中故意尚以政府中人自居，且故意不用反中央反政府字句，其實精神處處由倒中央政府出發，想給，些不明不白的同胞，以爲「不知這些建設政府會怎樣處置」的置疑。這樣「建設」的形式，實比普通的「造反檄又」遷毒辣。第二頗懂得排住挑撥國共兩黨情感的方法，並將這一手韋來給兩黨中情感素不甚　洽的某些份子做買賣，想在業已不成問題之地方行政軍隊問題上，挑撥滔天大禍之後，便好來　「善鄰友邦」開出漁人得利的門徑。第三，到現在還拚命歪曲三民主義，故意將三民主義污衊得一塌糊　，未動搖國民大衆對三民主義的信念，好代「友邦的王道主義」收拾此人心，豈不聞兵法以「攻心爲上」因此，我謹勤各界各黨的朋友同志，萬不要被些謬論迷惑，我們要加強對政府的信賴，加緊相互的團結，甚加彌建立三民主義中國的信念。要做到他們，我們做的事，我們偏不做，他們不想我們做的事，我們偏要加緊實行，並努力去做。</p>
<p>今天陣綫已經非常明顯，然而然們有幾句話奉動留在西南港澳的一些老友，——尤其是和我年紀大約相等的老同志。我聽說汪氏及其「善鄰友邦」正在紛紛遣派×××××××××××××出沒於港澳各地，佈置其出賣人格的陰謀，這些人　膏藥的本領，我是依稀可以想像得到的。還不是那老套？但爲奉勸世人起見，我特有如下提請願與各同志共勉之！</p>
<p>第一，國難到此關頭，應該將過去的成見一一摒除，尤一對蔣中正同志的個人恩怨關係要放開一邊，不論蔣同志過去如何，他今天是在抗戰，是站在火綫上，單此，點，吾人即應全力擁護之，這一步路不要走錯，尤其不要上他們「反蔣大聯合」的老當，變了漢奸。</p>
<p>第二，大家共同簽名，即請我黨立即開除他黨籍，免得他幫搖上南京去代表什麼什麼黨，與×人去講話。大家再不要請他爲什麼「應總裁」了。同時要自已廉潔，節省國幣，保持晚節，××××來深懂赤錢之道。</p>
<p>奉勸同胞，切莫棄頭喪氣。陣錢更加分明，這是好現象。今後大家再不應有任何懷疑，而應萬衆一心，走向勝利的路！</p>

<p>本報元旦獻詞</p>
<p>歲序交替，萬象更新，本報今日與讀者諸君把晤，將獻何辭以爲諸君新歲頌乎？吾人回首租國，極目故鄉，烽火漫天，胡騎遍地，將士鏖戰於冰雪之中，同胞呼號於死亡綫上，而×人之野心未饜，漢奸之陰謀方肆，國家民族，危於纍卵，吾人固無以言頌也。雖然，吾人而能高瞻遠矚者，則當見×人漢奸，困難重重；末路窮途，迫於眉睫，反觀我國，則將士用命於前綫，愈戰愈奮，愈戰愈強，人民協力於後方，不惑不貳，不屈不懈；內則敗類淘汰殆盡，團結愈趨堅強，政治飛躍進步：外則各國一致同情，援助愈趨積極，國際地位提高，抗戰局勢，漸轉主動優勢，建國前途，已露光明曙色，吾人生當此大時代，吾人將接近大勝利，又鳥得無辭？</p>
<p>我國反對日本法西斯侵略之英勇抗戰，迄今已十有八月矣，過去十八個月抗戰之收穫，經難與敎訓，以及目前抗戰之形勢，與夫今後抗戰之趙勢，已詳於「第一期抗戰的總結與第二期抗戰的前瞻」一文，願讀者細加檢討，今茲吾人願爲讀者與當局諸公披瀝者，要約爲下列數端：</p>
<p>中華民國肇基，於茲已歷二十八年。以此二十八年喻人，則方脫離童稚少年時代而進入青年振作有爲時代。顧吾國過去既積二十餘年之內部紛爭與列強侵凌，蘄喪善弱，已至極度；而近七八年來，則受強鄰日本法西斯猛烈之侵略，終至傾舉國之力，實行其武裝征服中國之計劃。故吾國今日之所遭遇與處境，又非一般青年之求正規發展可比。吾國爲求獨立生存自由幸福，當此強×必要滅我而甘心之際，不得不奮起抵抗，一切痛苦困難之來，宜早在意計之中，無是驚奇，不得不奮起抵抗，一切痛苦困難之來，宜早在意計之中，無是驚奇，更無足影響吾人堅強抗戰之意志。乃抗戰十八月來，我國內部竟已完成廿八年來未見之團結，我在國際，亦竟挽囘近百年來日趨沉淪之地位，而我×國日本法西斯侵略者，在中國則軍事進攻碰壁，在國內則政治危機深化，在國際則外交愈陷孤立。故吾人今日自問，亦當知所以無愧於艱難創造民國之先烈，而提高吾人之民族自尊心與自信心，堅持抗戰到底，克服一切悲觀失望，反對任何妥協投降陰謀。吾人以無數千萬將士人民之鮮血，始有今日勝利光明之曙色，決不容亦不能爲任何人中途抹煞或出賣，此其一。</p>
<p>時代永遠前進，歷史不開倒車。吾人今日抗戰，一面固爲驅逐日本法西斯侵略勢力，俾我中華民族從死亡中從鎖鏈中解放出來，同時亦爲中華民族秉承五千餘年文明歷史，重新創造獨立自由幸福新中國之前提。而欲求抗戰建國之前提完成，吾人必須認真促進軍事上政治上文化敎育上更大之進步。消極方面，吾人必須加緊反對一切阻止吾人進步之失敗主義，守舊思想，封建殘餘；對於一切兩面份子腐敗勢力，應作無情之清掃，而任何分化分裂企圖，任何漢奸傀儡政府，均與我三民主義抗戰建國不相容，必須澈底掃蕩而消滅之。積極方面，若各抗日黨派與民衆之更加團結，與在羣衆中有威信對抗戰建國有決心經騐者之吸收。均爲今日爭取抗戰必勝建國必成俾將來能自由獨立於新世界之主要條件，吾人當立即促使其實現，此其二。</p>
<p>循上述兩大原則，吾人更願於此略陳具體之意見，以祝此民國二十八年之進步，以祝此民國二十八年之新猷。首主政治，吾人顧名思義，今日爲中華民國成立紀念，民國要義厥在實現民主共和，去年國民政府明令各省市於今日元旦成立參議會，其意蓋在推進民主政治，而其裨益於抗戰者尤不可限量；現各省多因特殊關係，除陜甘寧邊區等外多未定期成立，甚望政府與人民今後共同致力，促其完全實現。同時各黨各界之親密合作，尤爲保障抗建戰國之基礎，急須妥議切實辦法，防止挑撥離間，成立堅固組織。此外如改善政治機構，厲行肅奸運動，團結國內各族，皆所以密切政府與人民之聯系，軍力與民力之合作者，深望更有進一步之成績。次言軍事蔣委員長孫院長及陳誠，白崇禧，毛澤東，朱德諸將軍，最近均會闡明今後抗戰如何必須堅持久戰，全面戰，主動戰矣，然如何推進此新戰略於勝利之境，則有賴於前方後方及淪陷區一致之努力，若提高主力軍戰門力，創造新軍，改造軍隊政治工作裝備與訓練，若提高軍事技術，增建大規模軍需工業，若廣大發動戰區×後游擊戰爭，建立與鞏固抗日根據地，均爲他日戰略反攻之準備，而爲今日吾人緊急之任務也。再言經濟，吾人一年半來竟能對×穩佔優勢，誠爲政府努力之表現，但其間遺憾亦非絕無。今後如何認真實行戰時財政經瀇政策，增加收入節省支出，如何加緊西部各省之農工交通合作等戰時生產建設事業，諸待著著籌擬進行；而爲激切民衆抗戰熱忱，實行必要之民生改善，亦不可忽略；諸如難民及失業失學青年之救濟，實行必要之民生改善，亦不可忽略；諸如難民及失業失學青年之救濟，應有整個而積極之計劃。最後關於爭取外援，當此國際有利形勢之下，尤當盡力策進，吾人希望今後英美與各國援華制日，有更積極之行動，尤須注重軍火，原料，醫藥，技術人材，及財政等援助。而中日兩國與臺灣朝鮮人民反侵略陣缐之組成，亦應有相當之成就。</p>
<p>五中全會，傳將於本月十五日開幕，當此抗戰建國進入一新階段之際吾人並敢以上列諸點，藉作芹蒭之獻，想讀者諸君，亦必深具同情也。再者本報南來復刊，迄將一年，客歲十二年五日改版以來，尤蒙各界愛護，銷數突增，惟本報同人自漸淺陋，仍多未孚期許之處，今後益當奮勉，以期不失本報六十餘年服務人羣之旨，先總經理史量才先生及其哲嗣詠賡先生艱苦經營之誠，爲中國文化界忠實之一員，當此歲首，於恭祝新釐之餘，並懇加倍愛護，時賜指敎，籍匡不遠，則豈僅本報同人之幸而已！</p>

<h3>會見陶行知先生縱談戰時各種敎育問題</h3>
<p>— 朱其焯</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>提到「陶行知」的大名，很容易在訊者的意識中聯想到他的「深人淺出，亦莊亦譜」的特殊作風。</p>
<p>記者聞悉陶先生從桂來港，遂於前天下午前在九龍兒童書院訪問。在領敎方與巖先生一席充滿著朝氣的談話之後。陶先生就挾著皮包。很從容地踏進會客室。</p>
<p>陶先生的身材，臉龐，有點兒胖大，豐洞，卻又不像老　財主那樣的神情。頭髪剪蓬平頂，好像受訓的學生。中山裝的外面，套有一件沾滿了風標的舊式中。精神很飽滿，待人很和藹：是可親可鬆的典型大家敎育家。</p>
<p>略事寒暄之後，陶先生就很和氣地笑著記者的叩問。</p>
<p>「關於生活敎育社原有十幾年的歷史·亦幹過不少的工作；直到本月十五日才在桂林正式立案成立，重新展開工作。」</p>
<p>聽到「才正式立案」多麼使人與奮！「抗戰」實在值得歌頌。它已經把過去的「隔模」「悮會」種種的陰影，都一靡而清了。</p>
<p>陶先生接著說：</p>
<p>「生活敎育社從事了好幾運動；最初，針對著廣大鄉村的落後，就掀起了鄉村敎育運動。到了都市，爲了矯正敎育的私有與　佔，就展開普及敎育運動。直到×人步步侵略，華北漢奸猖獗·處在國難當頭的時候·就以國　敎育配合著當時的需要。抗戰開始了，一切都要服從抗戰。國難敎育就沿進爲抗戰敎育。現階段的抗戰是全面抗戰，所以現在要展開全面敎育來配合全面抗戰的需要。全面敎育的主要任務，就是要把敎育展開到我們的前方和×人的後方去·對號不僅是青年·壯丁，而且包括小孩與老太婆！·……這幾個運動的形式雖然不一，而其中心卻只有一個，就是普及敎育運動。不過它是隨著客觀現勢的發展而發展吧了……」</p>
<p>在很簡短的談話中，給中國新敎育史寫了一個很清楚的歷史沿進。陶先生隨著時代前進的精神。就是從這兒表現出來。</p>
<p>生活敎育的宗旨是什麼丫陶先生很扼要地說：</p>
<p>一、提高生活水準</p>
<p>二、啓發警覺性</p>
<p>三、培養創造力</p>
<p>這，無疑地是我國今日當務之急。接著，陶先生再談至新近在廣西發明的山洞學校。據陶先生謂：空襲的時候，席西的人民幾乎一半是在山洞中。爲了事避飛機而辦進山洞里去空過幾個鐘頭。或生日，整天，沒有事情幹，實在是很可惜的。山洞敎育的可能，第一，是因為山洞是天然的安全敎室、用不著一個銅板的建設。第二是老百姓自動前進來，不愁沒有學生。第三是在避難羣中，什麼類型的分子都有。亦不愁沒有知識日子可以在山洞允當敎師。出洞學校的課程內容是老少男女什么人都應該學習，可以學習的抗戰知識知各種抗戰應用的技能。現在廣西省，府已積極在訓練山洞學校的指導員。山洞學校亦就是生活敎育的一部份。比方老太必肩上壓了一個擔子，雙手遺要拉著小孩。這時，在進入山洞避難途中、青年人就應該幫同抱小孩，幫同挑東西，讓老小好好地避難，這種「服務」，就是一生活敎育一的精神，換句話說：生活敎育應該「跟老百姓走」。踵到山洞去，跟到樹林去，跟到……什麼地方去，一切的道理與辦法都跟從這「老百姓走」五個字演繹出來。但是，亦不是跟老百姓逃難，而是要從亂七八嘈的逃難羣中整理一個條理出來，使分散的力量集中起來，使難民成爲門士。</p>
<p>陶先生還告訴記者一個新的好消息。就是將在桂林成立曉莊研究所，在各處展開敎育研究工作。凡是戰時發生的敎育問題，如軍隊敎育問題，壯，敎育問題，傷兵敎育問題，難民敎育問題……都是目前急待研究的敎育問題，很需要提供實施的方案貢獻給政府與各方面的參考與施行。陶先生遍次來港的任務就是要來籌備一切。</p>
<p>這實在是可喜可慰的佳音·曉莊之再生，象徵著敎育之黎明，象微著民族的復興。</p>
<p>外面禮堂幾百個求知若渴的青年已在等候著陶先生的演講，記者不敢再躭擱陶充生賣貴的時間，最才是請問陶先生新近有沒作新詩，陶先生仲很高興地，答應記者的要求。立即摸出筆來寫了二首詩給記者：</p>
<p>來港聽得第一聲，小孩嘴里申報好：</p>
<p>銅板兩今娘兩張，果然返老還童了</p>
<p>每逢新年思故人賢才棄世恨太早，</p>
<p>長咽喉知在人間東洋妖怪該嚇倒</p>
<p>新年懷念</p>
<p>史公量才並祝申報前途無量</p>
<p>陶所知題（二八　九○一）</p>
<p>生活敎育小影</p>
<p>青采，豆付，糙米飯；</p>
<p>還要看，想，談，玩，幹、</p>
<p>喚起四萬五千萬，</p>
<p>準侵略戰戰戰！</p>
<p>文武同化歌</p>
<p>文人武化，</p>
<p>武人文化，</p>
<p>不文不武的文武化，］</p>
<p>文人不相罵，</p>
<p>武人不再打架，］</p>
<p>聯合起來，</p>
<p>創造新天下。］</p>
<h3>中華藝術協進會送舊迎新的聯歡會一致抨擊投降×人的汪精衛</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>特</p>
<p>晶亮亮的白色電光箳罩著長力形的餐廳，六十幾個藝術的愛好者，救亡工作的熱心者在大年夜舉行著聯歡會。</p>
<p>從活潑的笑聲轉變爲嚴肅的空氣，填頭是屈埃丁先生致開會詞；說明聚餐會一方面是歲末的聯歡，一方面是工作的檢討，還要稍額問，來實及會員提但意見，展開新年以後工作，接著是該會主席杜日章先生致詞，雖然是長衣馬褂的長者，針對著時局高呼「抗戰到底」年青的朋友報以一陣熱的掌聲，</p>
<p>以下，就是該會顧問在主席介紹之後運動地先後站立記來發表高見：</p>
<p>劉思慕先生說：「目前時局起了波浪，香港是波浪的中心。主和派和日本的特務工作者記到香港來了、我們要聯合起來，指導橋向體認時局，粉碎主和派和侵略者的陰謀。」這是此時此刻很中肯的呼籲、金記華銜生分析一年來英勇的戰爭幾庚從悲報到了日極，從動搖到了安定。汗精位的屈服，叛判，是今年鼓緊張的政潮，但是目前的困難局面一定會像以前一樣給我們全國上下所極破使它消滅的。新年就是要我們要努力來克服這最後。困難，目前，我們是無限興奮的。</p>
<p>說得更生動更有意趣的是蔡楚生先生，他說世界好像是一個舞臺，舞臺上的戲劇總有正派與反派二方面，日本的侵略主義當然是反派；我國爲自由獨立而抗戰當然是正派，戲劇上的反派一定要連失敗，日本的末日自然亦是原料中事，</p>
<p>至於國內政治舞臺，正派與反派可就不容易分別出來了，因此，舞臺上的主角排演得很苦惱；我們觀衆看起來亦莫名其炒。主才幾位先生說的「波折」「緊張的政潮」……一來，這是最好沒有的現象。國內政治舞臺上的反派，一定要歸於失敗亦是毫無疑義的。主和，妥協的反派首領，他受著矇蔽而看不見民族與正義，現在，我們這羣中華民族的子孫，正派的份子，無論是主角，是配角，是小三角，以至於後臺工作者都要一致努力，把反派的角色撲滅；至於臺下的觀衆亦要高聲喝采；汪精華的反派真面目暴露，對於抗戰，對于中國，絕對是有利的。</p>
<p>這一席話在戲劇家蔡先生說起來很適合很得體，在這，藝術工作者的歡敘會席上說來又曉有意趣；一陣掌聲，報會心的微笑。</p>
<p>還有司徒慧敏先生說：分裂，分化，波折發生於此時，越是值得恭賀新禧，因不如此，不會起湖汰作用，政治還不會明朗。</p>
<p>王紀元先生林煥平先生亦都有所發揮，對於汪精衛的拍賣歷史，妄自發表妥協宣言都毫不容情即二擊著，汪先生要是親臨其境，不知將何以自解</p>
<p>顧問們的致詞已經花了好些時間，大家就輕鬆　會塲之空氣，一面用餐，一面最著會員的自由發表意見，親切的勗勉，使人益加警覺與奮勉。</p>
<p>聯歡閉會幕了，艱苦的舊年亦悄悄地過去，在接受敎訓，在互相策勉之下大家興奮著開始展開新的工作，勝利與光明的新年亦降臨到人間了，</p>

<h3>新年雜感</h3>
<p>— 歐陽予倩</p>
<p>去年過新年是在上海，今年過瓣年在香港，我從小在外邊跑來跑去路慣了，早日成了東西南北之人，隨便在那里過年都是一樣，而且近年來從來就沒有反過年範過生日這一類事放在心上，要不是人家在說起，我自已定會忘記的。</p>
<p>置新年的快樂，只有童年的記憶。還如昨日。自從十幾歲離家以後，就可以說沒有安穩地過過一次新年，甚至於常我煩燜的時候，反覺得過新年是多事，不置一年總免不這一度的結算，把舊的賬本子結一結的賬本子新寫起，事業家希望業務比較繁盛，文藝家也希望能多貢獻一點·過新年未始沒有意義·他也有許多人專把舊文章抄來抄去，並不感到新年之所以爲新。</p>
<p>多過一次新年，人類多誰化一點，可是就個人而言過新年的次數多到相當的時候，美人的顏色開始減退，文藝家的思想開始凝固，這是一種悲哀，但也有青春永保，與時俱進的人，只要他不甘心停滯於一個階段。</p>
<p>野心家往往因個人的私利，極力想阻止時代的進展，便不擇手段建行其殘酷的主張，甚至於要把全人類的生活，遍回到十五世紀以前去，要大多數的人都變成渾渾噩噩，不識不知，以便於少數人的統治，革命和戰爭但胚胎孕育於此，所以說法西斯蒂就是戰爭。</p>
<p>數千年來的愚民政策，把中國人的阿Ｑ性格造成了，同時也養成了貪污的習慣，建議者珠巷議者暫是正面的壓迫；八股文試帖詩，是樹麼方法；「不癡不聾，不作阿翁」的態度，但是擔任貪污員收家奴的作用，這有知足長樂少管聞事一　的處世哲學，總之爲各人自掃門前雪的見解，致使族成爲一盤散沙，因以啓強鄰侵略之念，所以這回的慘禍，在頒行破承題文體之前，已經伏了枧了！然而直到最近我還親身聽見有某要人對我說「…如今是要注重訓練民衆，不必侈談組民衆，組織民衆而不能　山之，則有組織比沒有組織更壞」，大約他是　民衆有了組織不易用個人的和意去統治罷？有些名城的失陷未始不由於此，可是中國的民衆已經逐漸覺悟了。</p>
<p>今年的這個新年，是一個大轉戀的新年，人人都認清了中國反侵略的戰爭是長期的戰爭，同時世界反法侵略的戰爭，也醖醲到了相當的溫度，歷史堆積下來的垃圾污穢，將要作一次總掃除，「偉大的時代啊！」我們只贊嘆一聲便完了嗎？</p>
<p>我是在戲劇界服務的，自然也不能不替戲劇界有打算，打算甚麼呢？總之壓迫者只會有盡量的壓迫，被壓者便只有拚命的抵抗，其中毫無妥協的可能，我們只要問自已　全不　全，在地位十站得穩不穩，不必問炸彈落下來，會不會打到身上。前一個月還在想，倘若戰爭的範圍再擴大職業劇團是否能存在，現在不再想這個問題了，時代的巨輪輾過去的時候，有的細胞會因新陳代謝的作用變得格外健全，有的也就會死傷，正好比用手術治病一樣，不免有破皮出血，想去掉腐肉，就也不免會傷一點好肉，然而非如此病不能好，中國正在施行大手術，世界也因爲長了個法西病，正要割治一下，我們都是小細胞，遇到了要犧牲的時候，也目無所吝惜，何況戲劇運動也正是一個去腐生新的運動呢？恭祝新年進步</p>
<h3>新年談賭</h3>
<p>— 森禹</p>
<p>漫談日本的大賭</p>
<p>一到新年，很多人，似乎會想起賭，新年好像是賭博的季節，平時專靠捉賭撈「外快」的警察老爺，這時即使看見有人打開了大門，曉著兩腿在抹牌，也會裝做看不見，有時甚至還會「親上前缐一。」</p>
<p>一談到賭，我們又會運想起日本人的賭，日本民族性的好賭，證據很多，「泥足的日本」著者歐脫來女士，不久以前又有一本署作，齊名是「日本在中國賭博」；的確，日本現在正拚著整個國運在大賭。</p>
<p>到　日本的人，終可以看得到街頭「麻雀館」的林立，公開敗賭，名義上說只是消消遣，並不算賭然而暗中的進出口很大。所謂「西洋文化」的「撲克」吧，這玩意兒在日本亦特別盛行而且化樣非常之多　做，洋賭」。前幾次東京警視廳，曾興「財獄」，學生被拘罰的特別多，立敎大學的著名游泳選手也多遭殃，猶其說他們一非常時認識不足」。不是說他們天性如此吧，</p>
<p>在上海信過北四川路的朋友，終會見過晚上的七，八點鐘左右，常有大批日本，人往各汽車行雇車子被雇一空，叫汽車天開得越快越好，我問過汽車行的伙計，知道都開到跑狗　和回力球場去，有些汽車行單做這筆生意，也就夠開支了，</p>
<p>我們又知道　連，天津，上海這許多地方。一向賭風盛行，大多數賭場的後臺老板，便是日本浪人，目前是更不必說了。還是不只這些，即使像走私，販毒，制造僞幣之願，也何嘗不是變相的賭博；以前不曾用武力保庇的時候，日本浪人早也就幹這些勾當，他們想靠這些發橫財，然而，等到被時獲，被沒收的時候，也等於孤汪一擲的賭博。</p>
<p>現在，日本是把整個國家投入賭博的圈子了。好賭的人往往把家產蕩盡，連老婆的手環，戒指，孩子，「相歲銖」。以至冬　衣物都賣光當光。日本目前的情形然也已經類似如此地步。　的賭令——二百萬可動員上前缐的壯丁，已經賭去了至少三分之一，財物也賭輸了值一百回憶，現金早快賭光了。所獲得的是什麼？看爛的，永遠不會中彩的過號電檳！</p>
<p>日本人民已經知道，這麼大賭到底不是玩意兒，他們被軍閥強拉跑入這個大賭局，青木先生輸去了性命，田中先生輸去了一個兒子，山川先生輸去了一隻腿，子代子輸　了又夫……終有一天會，丟輸了整個的國家財徒又往往會向爸爸和老婆軟騙硬索要賭本，從然到了家破人亡。快近跳海的日子，也還不肯罷休。然而爸爸和老婆們的囊袋，也畢竟有底限，他也們終有一天會拿「顏色」給　個不肖的賭徒看。等著吧，等賭徒的末日，新年談賭，九三九年，也許正是日本財徒「跳海」的年頭。</p>
<h3>合作頌</h3>
<p>— 黃繩</p>
<p>新歲獻詞</p>
<p>今天元旦，恭喜！恭喜！</p>
<p>元旦是好日子，我們無論在屋子里，或者走在街上，都很裝一個笑臉，你想嘻嘻哈哈一下，也不妨嘻嘻哈哈的，遇到親戚，碰到朋友，都得打個拱，作個揖，你想說些吉利話麼，這年　也不是不許說吉利話的；「長命百歲」，「恭喜添丁」依然用得著，最好就加上兩句「爲國效勞」，「勝利，勝利！」總之是歡快不忘國事的意思。</p>
<p>元旦是好日子，一般人習慣在舊曆的這個日子，在家里貼一張「撝春」，紅紙黑字，寫著「一團和氣」，這張「撝春」就請改在今天貼起來吧，雖然節季不是春，這是隆冬時分，但是「撝春」「撝冬」有什麼關係，要緊的是取那字句的意思，「一團和氣」呀！是的，家人父子，從今日不要吵吵鬧鬧，對于家外人，縱使以前是死對頭，老冤家，也要一言歸好，雙方尊重，這年頭需要四萬五千萬人同心同德，沒有一絲芥情。</p>
<p>元旦是好日子，全國大小官員。都得向林主席，蔣委長，行個最敬禮，深深的五十度以上的鞠躬，然後彼此相對的也來一個，彷彿在什麼會舉行的，同僚同袍一興無，緊緊擁抱著接一個吻，也要　　作平常，斷不至大驚小怪，這年頭需要大家緊緊拉著手，圍成一個完滿的環形，不許有一個說了節，這個遊戲，是祇許休息一時下，不許偷偷地垂頭喪氣走開的，偷走的大家就要不當他是好傢，伙請他遠遠滾蛋。因爲這時候還有什麼不可商量的地方，你走開是不當你撤嬌的。</p>
<p>元旦是好日子，全國各黨各派的領袖先生，也來一個興高采烈的聯獄會吧，你們在過去一年半間，或者言歸于好，或者新做朋友，雖然大家　　各有文章，但并不是風馬牛不相及。在那位時代老先生的大筆下。同樣是濃圈密點，拍桌叫絕。他曾搖頭　腦朗誦出來，也已得到四萬五千萬人的贊美和佩服。那麼，趁這個好日子，還不歡聚一堂，碰碰酒杯嗎丫或者因了路遙道遠，雖然有飛機，也一時來不及，也該寫一張賀年片，彼此奇送。上面寫著：「精誠團結，建立新中華！」至於什麼公開信那長篇鉅精就用不著啦！</p>
<p>元旦是好日子，我們晨早出行，朝著大利的方向，迎接外來的幸福。祇要人，高興我，我就當他是良朋益友。趁這樣日子，深深行個禮。雖然不是新相識。原用不著客氣。但在這年頭不是日子中天的時候，四面都有多少陰暗，大家是朋友，就要幾路縱隊一道兒走。在今天，我們希望來一個大集會，會里要有五個角色，一個是帶了紅帽子的彪形大漢，一個是披了三色面巾的妙齡姑娘，一個是穿了米字裝的高等紳士，一個是滿身金元的有名貴客，還有一個呢，慚愧，慚愧就是我們這個老傢伙，除了這五個要角，還有無數上帝的孩子，大家朝著十字架，來一個和平的祈禱；然後齊齊拿出盒子砲，向著陰暗　三聲，當作歡迎新　的禮號。</p>
<p>我的頌　完了，我爲我的頌詞而高興，</p>
<h3>日本人民怎樣過新年</h3>
<p>— 斐丹</p>
<p>日本的軍閥，一向就告訴日本人民說，中國地大物博，只要併　了中國，就可以過安樂的生活！，同時又告訴日本人民說，中國民族衰老墮落，在歷史上已做過多次的亡國之民，併吞是極容易　。這次戰爭，不必說誰都知道，是他們爲追求極容易得到的安樂生活下最大的努力，現在戰爭已經一年半，但日本人民所得到的，只是加倍的維納租說，近百萬的公債負擔和一部吞沒整個人民經濟自由，政治自由的總動員法，此外，還有一個漆黑的前途。</p>
<p>現在已是戰事發生後的第二個新年！</p>
<p>說起過新年，發，如果在平時，日本人是配得上說「鮮艷」二字，因爲日本人平常本愛清潔，新年當然加倍的打　，每家的門前　起二樓柱的清松；張起鮮艷的紙圖；婦女小孩穿著色調奪目的新裝，大家以包裝　　，里面沒有什麼東西的紙色相互贈送；親鄰相遇時，則夾著不很自然的笑聲，互相不斷的灣腰，道著時說不盡的新年吉利話，在我們加些異國人看起，也頗是鮮艷好看。</p>
<p>到了戰爭已經一年半的今日。日本人民還有此種鮮艷的新年囑？</p>
<p>日本人民希望著戰爭早日結束，但是事實上誰爭是更其長期化了，做父母者所辛苦養育　大的壯健的兒子，送到戰塲上後，大部份都只運回來一包包「無言凱旋者」的骨灰，不然也只是回來個肢體殘缺的「白衣勇土」，很能壯健回來的；這點已經在我們的，中撤上一層灰，同時他們的日常用品，衣料，紙張，食物，禮品，等一切，已都由政府加以統制，不「」隨便講得，使其是備　運動，與公債強　大衆消化進行以後，　們即便質在要購買，也苦是沒有錢，現在日本政府對於退　人員的恩給金，與戰死者的撫恤金等，已有不發貨幣而發給公債　的事實！於是最近在日本的一個報紙上，報刊出一張漫畫，畫的是許多對日本人民，著著衣襟短短的衣服，哭喪著臉。</p>
<p>每屆新年，日本的人民無論是男女老幼，都要到「神社」里去，在神社錢箱中，投進一個銅板，把手拍二掌閉目默禱一會。在過去，他們當然希望新年能比舊年好，家泰人康，就把這個希願願告訴他們所信仰的「神」。但是今年，如果他們在形式不能不到神社去投銅板，拍掌，默禱的話，我想他們一定是這樣說：「神啊！我咀咒著你，你幫助著兇惡的軍閥，把我們的兒子編到另外一個世界去：我們喪失——自由幸福，把鮮艷的新年變成暗淡無光？」</p>
<h3>阿Ｑ的勝利</h3>
<p>— 思慕</p>
<p>新年應該說吉利的話，我就談談阿Ｑ的勝利</p>
<p>罵人「游來游去」的吐沫還沒有乾，自已因爲碰了一鼻子灰，先一溜煙飛一河內去了！這種「溜　主義」已經頗有阿Q的精神。</p>
<p>還不止此，當「囂囂之徒」看了「舊病復發」的謎一樣的消息，衆說紛紜，或語中帶諷，留點　步，或簡直當作落水狗水打的時候，素以文采辭令見稱的某先生」，卻還不見有隻字來辯明，也許這又是魯訊所說的一沉默是最偉大的武器」吧？</p>
<p>更奇怪的，以「先生」的忠實發主人自居的某報，這時對于這事也要做了三誠其口的金人，不爲一辯。前不多時，口口聲聲遺說「蔣委員長的主張就是先生的主張」：現在呢，由路透社節錄蔣委員長在，念週說明「先生」的離渝純是個人行動時演認的電訊，卻被它大刀闊斧地圖削掉了！所刪的自然是有關「先生」的一段，甚中央社繼續指出的蔣委員長的訓話的全文，單單在該報遍找不見，（至少到今天還沒有登出）。這是甚麼用意呢？沈獸而到了掩耳　目的地步，亦歎　止矣。</p>
<p>也許是通訊社恐怕有傷同業的感情，故意不把這篇或段官訊送去吧？但決不是「爲篇幅所限」。因爲，在同日的該報團卻用大字標願登戰張君　致主澤東的一封公開信，而目還乘機對中共咒詛。這樣子，吐了一下口沬，又取得一勝利仁了，縱然是「阿Ｑ的勝利」</p>
<p>可是，昨天報載追蹤而到查港的「先生」的大弟子，不是說「先生」出國「實負有國有重要日命」嗎？如果　「　府」還是重慶的國府的話，發言者不是行色匆忙沒有著見廿八日報上蔣委員長訓話的節錄，便是以爲此借看不見了。不過，總算有了一個「自以爲是」的答負。阿Ｑ又取得勝利了。</p>
<p>我們等待了好久，終於在去年的卅一口看到是先生的談話了。說也奇怪，真是和×相一吹唱，有異曲同江之被。這簡直不隊一個中國人講的話，有人說他已經挿了草標出賣，除了這外，我們也組不出他發表這樣談話的　他理由</p>

<h3>影劇理論黑暗的回憶與光明的前瞻</h3>
<p>— 蔡焚生</p>
<p>翻開中國電影的歷史，這短短二十九個年頭當中，雖歷盡盛衰消漲，但從本質上講，雖從一九二六年全一九三○年這中間的中落期，也沒有抗戰後這一年半中那樣急劇墜落（自然是指導營的），這是每一個　心電影文化運者者不能不感到痛心疾首的！</p>
<p>時至今日，除中國製片廠和中央攝影塲，在藝人們的支之下，光輝地擔負起抗戰中的電影使命之外，從一九三○年起接續著而來的「九一八」「一二八」所激起的民族電影復興高潮，是跟著「七七」至「八一三」中抗戰自衛的炮火劇烈地展開以後全部熄滅了！</p>
<p>這是一個如何「反常」的現象！</p>
<p>在這里爲著明䜍中國電影所以會走上「反常」的途徑，首先我們要接觸到資本的問題：我們知道，電影在世界是被列爲幾個大企業之一的，所以搆成電影的條件，是決不如其它藝術部門那樣的簡單，它從開始，作起以至完成廿，這中間隨時都須和大量的咨本取得密切的合作；而中國　電影商人，始終　祇是保存著中國手工業時期的經營主法，一切祇有固守，而沒有開拓，經營既不活潑，眼光又不銳利——有之則又從極惡劣方面發展，出賣電影響衛的真備，和剝削工作者血汁以飽自已的私囊。在這樣經營之下，碰到了大時代中暴風雨的來臨，前者目然招架無方，立歸解體，後者則槍法既亂而肆其所　；欲求一個能作爲中流砥柱，的，是憂乎其難的了，這是一。再次，我們要　　到人才的問題，我們知道，中國電影發展的歷史是相當的短暫，而最初的電影還是胚胎於文明戲與京劇——在南則爲粵劇，方在這十幾中，是連一個健全的專門訓練電影人材的　構也不曾出現過，所以，所有的工作多數是「半路出家」，修養的不夠，技術的拙劣，　普遍　通病，（我就是最不夠和最拙劣的一個）中不必談到作爲一個藝術工作者所應有的文學基楚和對世界觀人生活認識，而普通的常識有時也成很大的問題，像上述的這樣的工作×是在百分比中佔著最多的數字，因此，遇到非常時期的動亂，就鮮有不手腳無措，甚至慒然走上相反的途路，這是二。</p>
<p>基於上述的兩個原因，抗戰後的中國電影，必然地會造成悲謬的結果。這是不可避免的規律。</p>
<p>事實告訴我們，上海自淪爲所謂「孤島」以後，作爲電影文化中心的作用也即西移武漢——現在應該是重慶，（香港電影的出品雖多，但從質講，是和文化——尤其是抗戰文化　不來，所以不能取上海的中心地而替之。）有認識的工作者既被吸收以去，於是彿下的惟衣食升斗之是務，在別具「妙論」的資方以利用後，他們即兢兢業業從事于攝影麻醉民衆毒害民衆之神怪恐怖，香艷，肉感製作，以轉移民衆對敵抗戰的對象，以電影感染的普遍興深入，它的影響於抗戰前途，削弱我擔當這堅苦的長期抗戰的政府的力量，是不可以道理計的！</p>
<p>再次，是關於香港，香港的製作環境始終未受到影響，所以在初期也出過　幾部——雖然並不十分健全，但在現在看起來已是難能可貴的國防片，然而由於資本和人才雙方無可避免的缺陷，很快能整個的電影市即幾爲從腐朽的木魚書誼舟歌中發掘出來的所謂「民間故事」完成控制；另一方面則拚命從事於事淫門蕩色情電影的製作；繼此，所請神怪恐怖也接續而來，其鳥煙瘴氣的情形是較上海有過之而無不及。以粵語電影出品數量的多，和行銷地域的廣，它所收到的不良影響，更是不堪設想！</p>
<p>綜上以觀，佔中國電影全部百分之八十以上的民營電影是如此隊落——大部份甚至可以說是在「資×爲用」，那麼就要百分之二十以下的中國製片廠和中央攝影場的出品來支持這偉大民族自衛戰爭中向國內外廣大的民衆宜傳抗戰的意義和該勵抗戰的情緒了？我們應該沉痛地指出來，這是不夠的，一萬個不夠的！我時應該沉痛地指出來，這些僅有的出品所得到的宣傳效果還不夠那些毒素電影的「對消」！</p>
<p>當一個國家民族的危急存亡已經極點時，而他的子民——尤其是忝居智識階層而以責應指導民衆敎育民衆的電影工作者，不但不加以援助，而反——可以說大部份是破壞惟恐不及，這寧是恒情所能測度—於此，我們要替數百萬在前綫忍飢受寒正對××谷血作戰的勇戰十叫冤—我們要替百數—萬爲捍衛祖國而犠牲其賣貴的生命的戰士含冤—我們要替數千萬因受××的轟炸與摧殘而掙扎於屍山血海中的同胞叫冤！</p>
<p>我們有流不盡的涙，也有割不斷的舌，我們沒有個人的恩怨，也談不到私人的利益，我們祇是以血誠指出一切的錯誤。而希望每個不願做奴隸的中華兒女的醒覺，醒覺，第三個還是醒覺！</p>
<p>事實上假如電影工作者本身還不醒覺的話，我們應該老實不客氣地說：羣衆是早就醒覺了，我們沒有遇到任何一個普通觀衆不在痛罵這有毒素電影，並隨時在望國防電影或是有意義的電影的出現—而從南洋廣大的僑胞中所傳來消息，更沒有一處不對這種毒素電影表示深想痛絕——見之於事實的有不止一兩次的群用衆搗毀放映毒素電影的戲院，和進而有戲院的職員爲反對放映毒素影而罷工，其它從文字上的表現是不可勝數，這些應該是有耳共聞有目共見的事實吧！</p>
<p>於此，我們應該深切地相信，此時如有國防電影（假如正寫有問題，可用側寫，我們要活里國防電影這一形式）出而問世，必能得到廣大觀衆的熱烈歡	迎，換一句話說，也就是能夠「名利雙收」，「賣大錢」—因爲民衆祈求中華民國的能得利自出解放實在太殷切了——他們需要藉此得到安慰，剌激，和鼓勵自已抗戰的熱情！</p>
<p>最近蔣委員長嘗公開表示：抗戰一年半的今日，我們不但軍事外交有辦法，經濟也有辦法，我們的力量比抗戰前而強三十倍，最後的勝利，必屬於我們是沒有疑義的！售在還第二期的戰爭中，愈是接近勝和面建辛困苦也愈是倍的今日，我們的電影工作者，應確信「抗戰必勝，建國　成」，而無負統帥對每一個國民必須「人盡其力」並便「物盡　用」的期望，勿再徘㢠瞻顧，而毅然決然缷下爲千萬羣衆所詬病的無聊觀念，迎頭庭上去，趕上去！</p>
<p>一九三八年是在今天的以前過去了，一切頹廢的，淫靡的，違背抗戰，甚至破壞抗戰的，都讓它隨和舊的日子過去吧！我們要創造我們的新生！我們要堅強地站在民族的前綫負起每一個中華兒女的電影工作者所應負的責任！</p>
<p>一九三九年是從今天以後開始了，朝照耀在我們的眼前，光明在向我們招手！</p>
<p>我僅以萬分熱誠向南北高呼；</p>
<p>醒覺的電影藝人萬歲！</p>
<p>中華民國解放萬歲！</p>

<p>本期枯年號，本擬瀇大篇幅，對過去一年來的影壇和劇壇作一個較詳細的檢查；蒙各位先生於百忙中爲本刋撰文章，不勝感激；可惜臨時因爲篇幅關係，以致許多大作都未能登出，歐陽予倩先生的大作移到「自由談」去了，范嘉先生的「過去一年來里香港戲劇運動的活耀」，朱白水先生「一九三八年香港演劇新計」等文章，只得留在下期了。這，對作者，對讀者，我們是覺得非常的抱憾的。謹誌數言，聊申歉意，并望作者和讀者諸君深予原諒！。編者。</p>
<p>一年來的香港影壇</p>
<p>— 廬敦</p>
<p>去年，過了元旦以後，我們神聖的民族自衛戰進入了新階段，確定長期抗戰到底，堅定了最後執利的信念，這叫我們得到無限的興奮；而同樣的，在差不多是同一的時期內，香港的粵語電影地轉入一個新的唱段·可是粵語電影這一次的轉機，卻不但不能呌我們興奮，反而是叫我們感覺到異常的失望！因爲這一轉變的趨向沒有配合著當前的政治形勢，在過去的一年中，大部份的電影製作者，不但沒有負起抗戰時期本月所應負的任務，反而走了！相反的任務道路。在過去的一年中，所編的影片，大部份是其所謂「民間故事」的影片，而這些影片，是曾經被×人賞識爲「最合科王道」的影片！</p>
<p>過去一中年，在香港攝數的粵語影片，約有八十部；已放映者約共六十餘部，茲列表如下：</p>
<p>南洋天一公司：——</p>
<p>喜相逢　龍波飛將　太平洋上的風雲　散家子　拉車被辱　女人經　拗碎靈芝　影壇風月　紫霞杯　女戰士　三娘汲水　六月飛霜　苦盡甘來　捨子奉姑　琵琶行　叱咤風雲　銷魂大姐　柳曼玲</p>
<p>大觀公司：——</p>
<p>普天同慶　統金屋十二釵　慈田涙　十萬情人　新國民　肉搏　四子從軍　上海火綫後　流浪的父親　七朶鮮玫瑰　舞臺春色　孤兒行</p>
<p>南粵公司：——</p>
<p>從見天日　七星伴月　風流財主　同胞兄弟　桃花將軍　奇女子　胭脂涙　梅知府</p>
<p>山月公司：——</p>
<p>金　菊　公敵　閻瑞生　柴米天妻</p>
<p>中南光榮公司：——</p>
<p>八百壯士　花心蘿菊　陳萬年再世姻緣　陳世美不認妻　方世玉　孟慶君　好女十八嫁</p>
<p>其他公司：——</p>
<p>紅伶屯歌　乞米養家姑　戰雲情涙　賣花女　流氓小姐　桃色間諜　血肉長城　間氏反嫁難得有情郎　　點鸳鸯　正一孤寒種　錢作怪　一夜夫妻　粉粧樓</p>
<p>已拍而未放映的：——</p>
<p>女斷青鬼　夜光杯　口花花　摩登凱子（以上南洋，天一公司）</p>
<p>續七朶鮮玫瑰　逃刑孝子記　歌女白牡丹（以上大觀公司）　香江花月夜　梅開二度（以上南粵公司）　續金紫菊　（山月公司）</p>
<p>桃花女門法　（中南光榮公司）妒花風雨　春情烈火　萬田行屍</p>
<p>摩登女招夫　游擊隊進行曲　莊固胡蝶夢　最後的伴侶　（以上屬小公司）</p>
<p>根據上列表內的調查，則屬於「民間故事」的影片佔最多數，其次是倫理的和色情的份子，具有防章識的片子佔少數。</p>
<p>以民間故事作爲影片的題材，我們並不反對，因爲「民間故事」，正是最通俗的，最波一般民衆所能了解的；然而，問題就是一切破作爲藝術是的題材的素材，是不能無條件地採出，而必須加以選擇的。選擇的標準。一方面要看社會的需要，同時又只佔計其所必然發生的社會的反應及其幼果、</p>
<p>無疑地，藝術是必然地有其功利性的，質言之，藝術的製作是必然地有共！定目的意識的，現階的一切藝術運動是應該服務抗戰的；這是鐵一般的事實，但是那些是採用作爲影片題材的民間故事卻全無積極意義，而純然是封建性的腐敗思想的表現，共所得効果，固然毫不足以波動民衆對祖國的熱情，反而麻醉了廣大的民衆，所以通種影片，實在是要不得的。</p>
<p>然而，根據表內的營業情況看來，凡是比較賣座的影片，幾乎全部是屬於「民間故事」的片子，而被認爲具有成防意識的片子，幾科是全不協賣錢，這往往就被作爲專　毒素影片之流的藉口。</p>
<p>這是一個被不幸的現象，不容否認的，含有毒素的民間故事片子賣錢，而被認爲是國防的片子不賣錢，這是事實，但卻不能夠因此就否定了國防影片的存在（未完）</p>

<h3>新時期與新奮門</h3>
<p>— 張羣</p>
<p>在抗戰已經一年半的時候，我們進了一個新年、一個時序上的新年，只有更加引起我們的感痛、然而如果一年之計在于春，在一個新年之始，我們也應鞭自已作新的奮門、</p>
<p>在新舊年交替時候、我們無論在戰局上，在內政以及外交上，也正是一個轉變的時期、我們更應該認識迫轉變期的特點，來完成我們的任務。</p>
<p>一般的說，在這一年半的期間，我們的損失和犠牲，我們的缺點和弱點，是無限的。因此，我們的痛心，我們的慚愧，不是無限的，但是，在這一年半之半，我們也有我們的進步，我們的成功，縱使我們有損失的缺點，有的原因不是在今天才發生的，但在抗戰的過程中，我們無論在軍事上在內政上在外交上，都有進步的現象，也是很明白的事實，雖然我們決不以這些進步的現象，也是很明白的事實，雖然我們決不以這些進步自滿，雖然我們的進步還不夠趕上我們的需要，但對我們祖國之光明前途，我們的有堅強的自信，×人最初想不自而屈服我們，後來想「訊戰遠決」，推毀我們的戰門想們力消滅我們的戰圖意志，人費了九牛二虎之力，實在武漢陷落之，使我來，屈膝；想在廣州陷落之設，封銷我們；甚至干想用各種謀言各種陰謀動搖我們，以極慘酷俗來威舉我們，然后敵人的陰謀完全失敗了，今天恐懼不安的不是中國而主日本，今天失望失措的不是我們而是敵人，我們雖然遍雖血痕，然而是鐵人似的屹立奮鬬，敵人不僅失望于我們的愈戰　強，還要驚奇干我們的愈戰愈勇，我們在鬬奮中日益增強自已的力量，我們在血戰中奮鬬，我們也血戰中新生，我們有無限的哀，我們也有無限的壯，這偉大莊嚴、精神是中國民族的生命，而無疑的，這種偉大莊的嚴景象，固然靠全國軍民的努力，更　蔣委員長英非的領導。</p>
<p>目前在軍事上是在一個轉換的持　、在戰事之第一階段，在過去一年，半中間，敵人以優良的記備，佔領我們的交通綫和交通據點、我們有無數的損失，但也有消耗敵力的成功，而我們的記備技術士氣軍心也因這種血的鍛鰥而進步、今後的戰爭、勢將以運動的爲主、時期的戰爭雖不一定完全如遇去之緊張，但範圍一定更爲展開的全國戰部分將是敵的相持的戰塲，但僅僅相持，不是我們的目的，我們必須加速組組我們新戰國力新武裝，使我們的在第二階段反守爲攻，以同等和優勢的戰門力擊退×人。在這個相持之局中，我們一方面要在前方加強抗，同時亦須將×人後方化爲戰塲，并且，在我們後方面強建軍和生產的事業。我們的努力愈大，這一相持之期可以愈短，而我們轉敗爲勝之日可以愈快。</p>
<p>在內政上設，一年半以來，奠定和充實了民族之統一，無疑是民國以來我們政治上最大的成功。我們不僅要抗戰到底，而且要統一至於水刦。但今後最大的問題是發揮統一力量，發揮統一機能。如何才奉發揮統一的力量和機能呢？這就要人人守法，人人守法，就是人人責，人人奉公，古之所請紀綱，即今日所謂法治，一年半以來，我們不僅有國家之統一，國法也提高了權威，但他們還沒有貫澈守法精神，溺職凟職，奢侈腐敗，敷衍塞責，都是由不守法紀而生，國家兵役生牽的要政未能充分推行，甚至節約都不能力行，也是由於法令沒有貫澈，我們已在抗戰中，下現在國家規模了，今後必有人人守法，建立現國家的精神，法治的精神，必須如此，我們才能迅速完成兵役生產計劃，建立現代國家的實力，最近對于公務員逸樂的取締，可以說是厲行法治的開始。此外，爲了適應全面戰爭的需要，淪陷城政治及民衆組織問題，當然也是常前努力的目標。</p>
<p>在外交方面說，一年半以來，然國際上沒有大的變化，但是實在是一個醖釀時期、而在這醖釀期中我們有許多成功、第一，是歐美各友邦對中國的　識與同情日益增加；其次，是日本日益陷于孤立、國聯對華決議逐次進步說明前者，英美積極擴軍和日本對外留易漸底落說明官者、因爲這兩個原故，太平洋兩民主國家之英美，也得到空前的接近、今日隨日本實力日益消耗，中國統一及實力之日益增強，國際局面必日益好轉，最近英美借款之成立，不過是友邦具體援華之初步，而援中國也可是制裁日本之先聲，最近日本對九國公約之聲明，遠不若當初所宣傳的露骨，是已經感受到國際之數脅了，中國除日本外均視爲友邦，中國從來珍一切友邦患難的交誼；而我們相信，我們統一愈堅，力量態大，也一定能得到友邦更深切的援助，因爲一切友邦一定、日益認協和禮驗得到，援助中國就是援助自已。</p>
<p>戰局及中國的前途，有必然的光明，旦早日實現這個光明，全靠各界同胞的共同努力。我們尤共不忘記，我們進步，國際局面亦好轉，敵人未在自已「日腹」以前，一定也還要抓狂，最近近衛聲明還要繼，侵略，自然他不說我們也能知道，我們唯一答應繼續抵，加強抵，我們對民族史前途抱定的樂觀，但時時刻刻不能懈怠哀嚴的戮力，今日一切的戮力，應該適合目前軍事上的需要，即是一面和敵人作全面的抵抗，同時迅連充實相建設我們內實力，準備全面的反功，需要人人刻生節約，守法奉公，貢獻法令，貫澈國，而人人必須抱這一偉大而嚴肅、信心，要能在明年今日，同時繼賀抗戰的勝利，</p>
<h3>開發內地</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>過去我們的重要建業，很自然的多集中於沿海及沿鐵路缐，對於重要的內地，政府及一般投資的人，都來不及充份注重。抗戰以來，，人地資源的重要與利用的必要，已爲國人所公認。開發西南與開發西北的呼聲，現在已天溢國內，可見國人的視綿已經轉移，過去不十分受人注意的內地，現在已成爲朝野經營的對象了，這是一件可以慶慰的事。</p>
<p>我們的內地，資源甚爲豐富，假如各界能夠合作，努力開發這些資源，實在可以作爲我們抗戰建國的基礎。拿四川一省來說，岷江陀江之間，便是一個很明顯的經濟區。在這個區域里，不田農產品甚爲發達，就是主要的工鑛，如煤，鹽，絲，紙及糖都已，相當基礎。如能發展電力，利用本區域的豐富資源有別種工業也可有相當的發展。又如以重慶爲中心的嘉陵江流域，過去爲川省的工商業中心；工業方面，如染織工業，　革工業，玻瓷工業，火柴工業，麵粉工業，肥皂工業都有若干工廠設立；鑛業方面，如江合，天府，燧川等煤鑛，都有若干生產能力；輸出貨物，如桐油，豬，絲，羊皮，藥材，夏布，煙葉等等，每年均在百萬元以上。抗戰以後，後沿海口鐵路綫移來的工廠，在一　家以上。所以這個區域，將來一定是一個工中心，不但輕工業在這兒可以發展，就是重工業，因爲重慶附近，鐵及石油等均有編藏的緣故，也可在這兒樹立基礎。四川除卻這兩邊區域之外，還有以萬計爲中心的川東獲域。我們都知道中國近來的出口貿易桐油屋第一位，而四川的桐油，產量與品質，在國內均首屈一指。萬縣便是四川省桐油集中最大市塲。這個區域，在國際貿易上的重要，於此可見一斑。四川以外，如西康青海的金，貴州的水銀及煤鍍，雲南簡舊的錫，以及滇越路滇頃路附近的煤銅鈴鋒銀等鑛，廣西的錫及其他國產，陜西的棉花及煤，甘肅青海一帶的羊毛，皮革及藥材，都在那兒等待我們開發。這些資源。有的可以樹立我們國防工業的基礎。有的可以作民生工業的原料，有的可以運輸國外，以換取抗戰的軍備及生產的工具，都是在抗戰建候的過程中所應努力經營的。</p>
<p>我們既已明䜍開發內地的重要，又看清楚了內地有許多富源急待開發、便可進而討論開發內地的方法、現在社會上有一種誤解，以爲開發內地只是政府的工作。當然，政府對於這種大事，不可諉避責任，應當去擔任他所能夠做的部份，不過如謂政府已在那兒推動這種工作，別人便可市手旁報，那便是最大的誤解，政府的工作重在推動與領導全國的人力財力，在一定方針之下，去努力開發內地，在這種統理之下，實在努力的當然須靠各界的勇往直前，盡瘁盡力。在這樣共同努力之中。政府機關也擔任經辦一部份經濟事業，甚用意乃是爲國造產，而非與民爭相，所以舉辦的事業，都以下列原則爲範圍。（一）國防所急需，應當特別經營的；（二）有統籌或統制之必要的；（三）規模宏大，設備艱鉅，非尋常財力所可象辦的；（四）爲國防民生所亟需，而盈虧無甚反握的；（五）爲民國工業供給動力或烯料的。政府所辦的事業，都要合於上列幾個標準，而且並不獨佔。政府所辦的事業，如人民願意投資，也可商定合辦或互相聯擊的方法。除有特別的理由以外，政府不因辦了其種事業，便禁止或妨礙人民舉辦同類的事業。就是法令上規定是由國營的，政府也可以合辦或出租的方法，委託人民經營。如經濟部最近曾公布國營鑛區管理規則十五條，便是要把依法規定的國營鑛區，給人民開採的機會。現在最大的需要便是生產，而且要大量的生產，以爲前方後方及輸出之用。假如現在把國營的範圍定事太廣，同時又無力量去經營這個範圍內所規定的事業，那麼國內的生產力，反因受了拘束而國能發揮其功刻。所以我們一方面對於不營事業，認真整理，以其造成事業的規模，同時對於民營事業，也極端看重，認爲國家經濟的基本，必須認真發展。</p>
<p>政府對於民營的事業，一向是竭誠獎助。現爲加增開發內地的速度起見，預備從下列三方面積極進行，使民營事業可以更爲發達；第一爲工作的聯絡。以前民營事業每皆各自爲政，毫無組織，現在政府擬使各業均依照新定法規，組織同業公會，各業間亦發生聯系，如化學工業所需之機器，可以交給機器業代爲製造，而機器業所需之鋼鐵，又正在設法協助供給。較此之間，聲息相通，供求相應，以形成有機體，便可事半功倍，效率方增，這種聯絡組織的工作，政府自應擔負，第二爲資金的協助。民間事業，每以缺乏資本，而中途停留？現在抗戰期間，若廠由干工海沿江遐內地，舉凡運輸建廠購料等事，都需要大批的資金。後方的鑛廠，因擴充生產，改良設備，也要加增資本。政府間忽他們念需要一方面代向銀行以低利借貸欵項。一方面由政府直接撥助資金，兩種合計在過去一年之內，已達一千萬元以上，後還要照原定計畫，陸續協助。第三爲獎勵的規定。二十七年六月修正的特種工業保息及補助條例，規定六種應由政府補助及保息的工業，範圍未免過，而且獎勵的方法，限於保息及補助二種，也未能盡獎勵的處事。最近通過的非常時期工鑛業獎助暫行條例，把獎斬方法，加至一種，除保息及補助之外，還有減稅，便利輸運，免除地租等項。至於應行獎勵之工業，其範圍亦擬擴大，凡（一）爲國防民生所必需要亟宜舉辦，，（二）發展內地大宗生牽或使舊有大宗生產品質更爲精良者，（三）可供輸出國外，以增進對外貿易的，（四）利用本國原料，仿整外洋產物，以減少貿易漏巵者，均在獎勵之例。</p>
<p>政府對于經濟事業，全盤統籌，共同促進，如此進行，可謂之管理亦可謂之統制。其方針與整個大家利益爲最高前提，悉力以赴，以期奠定復興的基礎。大家也應明白國家的利益亦是一般國民真正的和益，而且亦惟有不分朝野向同一方向認真進行，方能鐘到此極重要的目的。因此特爲說明，望大家都秉匹夫有責之義，來完成偉大的使命。</p>
<h3>民國廿八年元旦對同業的希望</h3>
<p>— 薩空了</p>
<p>從新疆回來，適值香港申報要出新年特刊，嚌我寫一篇文章湊湊熱鬧，這次回到香港，雖說已是兩肩輕鬆，不再僞過去有那麼許多責任，但是爲了已決定在此地結束各事後即車返內地，所以依然是忙碌萬分，不過香港申報向我徵文，自覺似乎不應偷懶，因爲申報是中國歷史最久的日報，像我這樣決定將畢生精力獻給新聞事業的人，對這歷史最久的日報，當然不應放棄任何一個可以向他出點力量的機會，再則上海申報是和上海立報須同樣的情形之下停刊，它更給我一種感覺，就是我們之間還有一次風雨同舟的關係，因此雖在百忙中，我仍要爲它寫幾自個字。</p>
<p>前面我已說過，我是打算把畢生精力獻給新聞事業的人，所以在民國廿八年元旦我想談的問題，也還是有關新聞事業的問題。</p>
<p>從離開上海到現在，業已整整的一年，這一年是中國各方面都有鉅大變化的一年，中國的新聞事業，當然也不能成爲例外，爲了漢口廣州的淪陷，中國的全國性的日報，差不多都變成地方性的了，香港重慶的日報，現在雖在成空前的擁擠狀態，但是爲了交通的困難，各報都只能在港渝附近銷行。所以港渝民衆的日常精神食糧——日報，在量的方面。是過剩了，可是全國各地民衆，尤具是名爲淪陷，事實上並未淪陷，或是鄰近淪陷區域的民衆，都在覺著普遍的日常精神食糧的饑饉，我這次由港赴新疆注返二萬里的途中，叫我感慨最深的就是這一現象。</p>
<p>不必說淪　區，就是內地較小的城市，日報的該後情形，簡直出人意想之外，尤其可憐的是，極落後的日報，甚至有的地方還沒有。這最重要的宣傳工具。在民衆事是這樣不健全，我們如何能談到真正的全國總動員？</p>
<p>所以如果有人要問民國廿八年我們首先應昨的工作是什麼？我站在我自已的崗位上回答，一首先應作的工作，是叫全國無論已否淪陷區域里的窮鄉僻讓，都能看得見報紙。因爲只有作到遠一部。我們的抗戰力量，才真會「只有增強不會削弱。」</p>
<p>在過去這一年中，在新聞界里我只覺得一件事，最有意義，那就是最近新華日報在淪陷區中的華北版的發刊，我認爲，我們這些獻身給新聞事業的人。與其擠在涉淪兩地，爲無聊政客作工具泯飯吃，實遠不如到窮鄉備壞的小村鎮中去辦油印報，或壁報，本著自已的良心作醒喚民衆的工作有意義。</p>
<p>所以在今年的元旦，我要要求每一個新聞界中的同人的想一想，自已現在爲著什麼，過那以夜爲盡的生活，自已的工作到底在這國族頻於危亡的今日，對國族是否會有點補益。如果這樣一想之後，你感覺到過去自已完全錯了。那我希望大家就從今天起改換你們工作的方向。</p>
<p>所謂新的工作方向，當然是到小村鎮小城市中去肩起來報道宣傳的責任。但這個目的，大家一定要說不是只憑赤手空拳所能遠到的。物質條件不夠，鄉間民衆都是文盲，兩重大難關極不易打破。所以即或有想實行我這話的人，結果也只好空想一陣，知難而退。</p>
<p>這說法是不對的，我對怎樣實現深入民里間去肩負報道宣傳工作這件事，在兩萬里長途旅行中。想了已經很多。到現在止。我得到的結論是：</p>
<p>爲求應用的工具簡單，爲求文盲易於接受，我們如果要到鄉間去辦報紙，只有辦拉丁化文字報紙的一途，</p>
<p>在工具方面講，最簡單的，只須一架油印機，一具收音機，更好一點的設備，是一具收音機之外，再須備幾副英文鉛字，一架足登機，已就足夠用了。</p>
<p>至于文盲接受內辦法，是到一個地方，先找一部份青年敎給他們拉丁文字。然後就出報紙。則他們很快的能意識到自已不必用多大的力量。多長的時間，即不再是文盲。甚至已能看報。那時，價目不必再變愁你的工作沒有成績，我擔保，你的報紙，在很短的時期內，一定會有極大的開展。</p>
<p>在上海，新文字研究會主辦的「大衆報」，已有極良好的成就，那就是我們的一個好榜樣。</p>
<p>如果所有的新聞界中的同人能夠有許多人。感覺得我這個建筑還有道理。</p>
<p>而大家組織起來，在一個較大的城市中設立一「中心」然後大家分散到各村鎮中去，經過這個「中心」交換工作經騐，我相信在這個工作中，大家不只是對國族盡了力量，對自已也可以比苦守在港渝各地混飯吃，增多許多有益的經驗。</p>
<p>我希望在今年這個元旦，假中國首創的日報——申報，把我這個理想介紹給大家，願大家來爲中國的新聞事業再創造一個新的紀元！</p>
<h3>從汪兆銘異動說到我第二期抗戰之政略戰略與戰術</h3>
<p>— 陳孝咸</p>
<p>汪兆銘建義接受亡國條件，與日談判和平之荒謬文件、已於十二月卅日夕公開披露矣！此一套之把戲。記者早有所聞，惟不願以君子之心。腹小人之腹，是以暫守緘默。</p>
<p>在汪兆銘之腹案中：（一）秘密離喻，（二）俟抵遠安全地帶，×相近衛聲明發表，（三）兆銘依據近衛聲明發表宣言響應，（四）……（五）……（六）……。記者以（四）·（五）·（六）等步驟尚未揭開，且羅織過廣，誠恐爲挑拔離間之陰謀所中，故不願爲傳醫筒，宜之于報章。今兆銘已靦然不顧一切，露出真面目，行見其逐幕排演出來，則其有無影響及於抗戰絀綫，當爲海內外人士之所關心，記者並負責答之曰：「絕無影響」，其理由已宣佈于兆銘荒謬建議未發表之先三日，文曰：「使一旦屈身事　」，則人格喪失盡矣！不啻自絕于國家，自絕于國人，千夫所指，無論任何館辭與謠辯，皆不能自圓其說，有何號負可言！此種論斷與信念，無論，諸何人皆爲適用，爬得愈高，跌得愈重，知乎此，則知自今以後相戰陣容已由混沌進至明朗，循此而往距最後勝利之期，誠不遠矣！（載在天文臺半週評論第二二一期）惟記者本坦率之懷，有不能自已於言者，自有兆銘之異動，益啓×國軍閥深入無忌之戎心，中日兩國民衆至少須多流一千萬人之血，不特吾國廣大民衆。×××××××××××××××××××××××·即日本臣民。慟子持續戰爭，非至有婦皆寡，無兒不孤之悲慘世界不止，××××××××××××此中經過，有可得而述者。當×軍政下我廣州與武漢之後，而有封銷長江與珠江之一舉，敝出英美兩國積極行動，以信用袋款最初步，平行援助我國持續抗戰，此在近世「以資源判職爭勝負」之原則之下，×國持續流血之無代價，不必徵諸高明政略家與難略家之意見，即問狗頭事帥，亦能爲肯定之答覆，不該再打下去，故記者于半月以前，會暨次暗示，×國方考慮「持續戰爭與結束戰爭熟爲有利」，敢自諸如見其肺肝然。×軍之苦悶興煩燥，未有甚於此時者。近衛聲明之擱置與僞聯邦組織運動之中止，皆爲×國棄戰言和之徵兆，而軍部內部亦有取一月十六日不承認我國政府宣言條件撤兵出境，返還侵地之醖釀，惟以茲事體大，雖頑梗如坂垣，亦未敢爲彰明顯著之行動，只有先將主戰最力與全面亡我中國之最激烈分子，如參謀本部次官多田及陸軍省次官東條二人調出軍部心臓部，而代以中瑞與山脅之溫和派，我河南與西北兩人戰區，無形中入于休戰狀態者，亦以此。日本求和之迫切，自九一八以來，未有甚于此時者。顧以我最高領袖堅持抗戰到底，非由日本先行撤兵出境，表示誠意，敢以談判之說進者，殺無赦，×方于此，主苦不得其門而入，但若持以時日，×當再衰三竭，知雖的撤兵，此外×方軍部意志亦不一，而在華特務臨關，自始即以總動員態勢。各尋門徑，而兆銘左右日本通者特多，此中如何穿針引綫，當係神不知鬼不覺，吾人更未敢妄加揣測，但能做到兆銘悄然離諭，并于半安抵達河內之一剎那，近衛聲明隨之發表，兆銘且于近衛聲明發表之後，以建議文章之形式，作響應宣言之實質，圖窮匕現，固爲舉國所棄，且以後一幕一幕之表演，亦未必能所預期實現，更由遠處而言，固無影響抗戰全局，或足甘肅清游移分子，鞏固抗戰陣容之助，但由近走而言，不去不令人痛心疾首，西北戰塲之急轉直下由靜而動，兆銘不得不尸其咎也。</p>
<p>華北×特務機關長喜多，最近密電軍部曰：此間方爲截斷中蘇國際交通路綫與進攻陜北及曠大滿蒙領城之大企圖，決未可中途示弱退讓，或爲妥協言動，以自援中心。喜多之言，胡爲而發，寧非因兆銘行動，而益啓一蠻幹到底，進兵西北，全面侵略，擴大僞組織之孤注一擲之野心耶！吾故曰：自有兆銘之異動益啓×國軍閥深入無忌之戎心，中日兩國民衆至少須多流一千萬人之血也。</p>
<p>嘗讀宋詞：「⺎術敗予朱仙，欵棄汴而去。有書生叩馬曰：太子毋走，岳少保且退—⺎術曰：岳少保以五白騎破吾十萬，京城日夜望以來，伺調可守丫生曰：自古未有權臣在內而大將能立功于外者，岳少保且不免，況欲成功乎—兀術悟，遂留不去。」</p>

<p>凡茲數要點，詢之×國名戰略家，皆無法不認我軍所處之優勢，決不因兆銘一羣之異動。而影響中央力量之集中。國際形勢之好轉，山地作戰之堅韌。鼓後勝和之取得。況且兆銘離逾之後，在海外不無爲其以注之茜命假面曰昕震憾，而相醫以伯有，而前方與後方，軍中與府中則轉以爲發覺尚早，澄清可期，故未予以若何之重視。我最高領袖且于廿七日出席紀念週之後，即飛往西北大地，調度軍事。雖黃河結冰。晉陜之間，接壞千里，訪處可度，但自河津以北，兩岸陡絕，陟降難如登天，河津以南，河岸地勢穩綏，固易于進出，但我有大軍密佈，隔河砲擊，阻×前進。夷老其後力聯絡。僅有正太與同滌兩鐵路。可以利用。而自新鄉交叉點之道清鐵路。止于清化鎮。越此而西。則爲公路。輸運力並不優越，此以山西爲根據地進攻陜北。而批判其非易也。×之攻陜不×道鄭州，循隴海徵路西進，足見其兵力已不敷調度，今者喜多竟大言截斷中蘇國際交通路綫與廣大滿蒙佔領區域與並攻陜北并舉，其不足重視之處，與兆銘之異動。初無二致，記者不願再濡毫及之也。十二月三十一日香港</p>

<p>申報元旦特刋</p>
<h3>對日抗戰與本黨前途</h3>
<p>— 蔣中正</p>
<p>本文係蔣總裁在國民黨臨全大會演詞之重要部份因尚未發表故特爲刋行</p>
<p>此次中日戰爭，是國民革命過程中無法避免的一戰，也是日本蓄意滅亡中國的大陸政策，和本黨挽救中國的革命的對策絕對衝突的必然結果。本黨這個革命的政策，是我們總理所定下來的，要說明本黨，總理既定的革命對策，先要明瞭日本帝國主義者侵略中國一貫相傳的大陸政策。日本自明治以來，早就有一貫的大陸侵略計劃。過去甲午之戰，他侵佔我們的臺灣和琉球，日俄戰後併了朝鮮侵奪我們旅順和大連，就已完成了他的大陸政策的初步，他就以臺灣爲南進的根據地，從此侵略我們華南和華東，而以朝鮮和旅大爲他北進的根據地，由此進攻我們的滿蒙和華北，要想以杜豖長蛇的姿勢；從入陸與海軍兩方面來完成他包圍中國，滅亡中國。獨霸東亞的野心。這種野心，我們只要從前田中對滿蒙積極政策的奏章，以及日本最近侵略華北，華東，和華南的事實，就可以完全明白我們總理在世的時候，早就看穿了日本這個野心，和中國所處的地位的危險。他爲本黨定下一個革命的對策。就請要「恢復高臺，鞏固中華」，因爲高麗原來是我們的屬國，臺灣是我們的領土，在地勢上說，都是我們中國安危存亡所關的生命缐，中國要講求真正的國防，要維護東亞永久的和平，斷不能讓高體和臺灣掌握在日本帝國主義之手中，中國幾千年來是領袖東亞的國家，保障東亞民族，樹立東亞和平，是中國義不容易辭的責任，爲要達成我們的國民革命的使命，遏止野心國擾亂東亞的企圖，必須針對著日本積極侵略的陰謀，以解放高麗臺灣的人民，爲我們的職志，這是總理生前所常常對一般同志所講的。</p>
<p>日本既然定下了侵略中國的傳統政策，而我們中國國民爲秉承總理遣志，貫澈拯救中國的決心，彼此針鋒相對，絕對衝突，因此除非日本放棄他侵略的野心，撤退他侵略的暴力，中日戰爭是無法可以避免的，而且就中國方面來說，我們不想求我國家的獨立和民族的生存則已，如果我們要實行總理的主義，貫澈本黨救國的使命，使我們祖宗遺傳下來的五千年悠久光榮的歷史和文化，能夠繼續發揚光大，使我們廣大民衆，物產豐饒的決決大國，能夠復興強盛起來，就非打銷日本侵略的野心，排除日本侵略的勢力，不能達到我們的革命的目的。</p>
<p>日本爲貫澈他的大陸侵略政策，幾十年來總是想盡方法，要求消滅我們中國國民黨，以達他滅亡我們中華民族的目的，他爲實行這個侵略政策，用盡了種種陰謀毒計，真是處心積慮，一言難盡。他所用的第一個陰謀就是瓜分。當民國十六年，我們黨軍分伐打到南京的時代，他就藉口南京事件，爛動列強，要想瓜分中國，本來瓜分之說，起於中國內情的腐敗，就紛紛強迫清廷訂立條約，割定各國勢力範圍，後來經過庚子義和團以後，瓜分之說就無形打消，到了民國十六年南京事件發生，日本忽然提出重行瓜分的主張，他爲什麼要提出這個主張呢？就是知道日本此際雖不能奪得中國整個的利益，但一定可以多佔瓜分的便宜。所以他在當時竭力引誘列強共同干涉，要實行瓜分中國，此議提出以後，英國不置可否。靜待英國的態度而定，常時美國爲要堅持他們戶開放，機會均等的傳統政策，反對日本的提議，瓜分之計，遂不得逞，這是十一年前日本對中國的一叚侵略史。</p>
<p>日本知道兩分中國的計劃。既無實現的可能，就改變方式，要想獨佔。他這個獨佔的野心，我們只要看從九一八以來，他一面加緊侵略，一面聲言凡是關中日問題，都拒絕第一國干涉，就可以完全明白，他要實行獨佔，以達到完全滅亡中國的目的，最有利於他的方法，莫過於用暨食的計劃，逐步逐步的侵佔我們的領土，分割我們的國家。當我們革命軍第二期開始北伐的時候，他一方面阻止革命軍進到黃河以北，一方面陰謀在華北成立一個傀儡政府，現在他所設立的華麗僞組織，可以說在民國十六七年的時候，早已有此計劃，他因爲不許我們革命軍北上，就在民國十七年革命軍到達濟南的時候，實行出兵山東，用暴力來阻擾，造成河南事變，在他們心目中，總認局長江和長江以南，是英國及其他各國的勢力範圍，黃河以北一定要由日本支配。記得民國十六年我到日本的時候，田中義一公然向我表示，他說：「你爲什麼一定要帶兵北伐，你在南京不是可以成立一個政府嗎？」</p>
<p>這個意思就是指示我不讓革命軍到黃河以北，只能在黃河以南，我答覆他說：「革命勢力是不能中止的，中國必須統一，在中國境內，決不容許有兩個政府在，否則中國不安，東亞亦不能安定？」但是他後來仍然派兵陰我北伐，佔我濟南，藉此恫嚇，以爲我不敢繼續前進，他萬萬不料我們革命軍在日軍佔據濟南的時候，仍要渡過黃河，向北平推，終至克服平津，完成北伐，因是他分割華北的毒計，在這個時候，就受了一個很大的打擊。自從我們革命軍到達北平以後，東三省自動易幟，響應革命，由是中國全國都統一于本黨國民政府，這件事更出手日本意料之外，原來日來在日俄戰爭以後，即將中國的滿蒙尤其是東三省，視爲他的禁暨，銳意侵蝕，早有喧賓奪主之勢，等到革命軍到達平津，他以爲本黨革命勢力就此停止，必不能再向東北進展，同時他爲爭先阻此起見，一方發動皇姑屯的炸車案，一方派出浪人，搗亂常地政府機關，以示威嚇。而其實際目的，就是要在東三省另外成立一個政府，使東北脫離國民政府而獨立，根本不許我們革命力量發展到東北各省，但萬不料當時東三省當局自動要求統一于中央，因爲國民政府統一全國的工作，能夠順理乘勢，克底於成，更予他蠶食中國的政策，以莫大的打擊！</p>
<p>他瓜分不遂，蠶食不成，但侵略中國的野心，轉趨急進，田中去世以後，就則狂妄的所請少莊軍人發動了。田中死後，日本軍閥成爲羣龍無首，就如野馬失信，到了九一八時候，果然不顧一切，稱兵作亂，侵佔我東北，造成舉世震驚的大事變，使東亞和平乃至世界和平，感受了莫大的威脅。</p>
<p>自從九一八以來，迄今六七年中，日本之侵略中國，真是得寸進尺，無有止境，既侵佔我東北，又進擾我關內，侵入冀東，擾亂大津，長城之役，奪取我察北，淞滬之役，竟威脅我首都，逐步西犯，蓄意分割，要想循蠶食的步驟，達到完全併吞中國的目的，處此情勢之下，我們要死中求生，挽救國家，就只有拚全民族的力量，與××作殊死戰。我們都要知道，這一戰爭，如果無法避免，那麼早發動一天，中國所受日本餿略的禍小，如遲發動一天，我們所蒙的禍更大，所以，去年七月蘆溝頹事件發生的時候，我們就確認中日和平已絕望，我們國家民族，已達到了生死存亡的最後關頭，此際只有毅然決然，發動全面長期的抗戰，以打破蠶食分割的毒計。但是我們實行全國抗戰以後，日本××主義者，知道吞食的計劃不可能，就索性動員大批海陸空軍，肆行武力侵略，實現他鯨吞中國的夢想。</p>
<p>他發動蘆溝橋事繼以後，謂集大批海陸空軍進佔平津，侵犯淞滬，聲勢洶洶，不惜出于一戰，其實他的用意，還是一貫的運用他二十四年以來的政策，想實行恫嚇，以達不戰而屈我的目的，他不知現代的中國，已不是二十歲年前袁世凱時代的中國了。他沒料到總理偉大的信仰，已深于人心，本黨革命勢力，已植基於全國，尤其是他只看到我們的國防軍備，還沒有完成，物質經濟的力量，還沒有盡量開發，因此在他動員武力侵略的時候，只計算到中國的軍備武由以爲敵不過他，而沒有將我們地大物博人衆，一切無盡藏的潛力計算在戰爭力量之中，更沒有將我們總理和革命先烈犠牲奮門，一貫相傳的革命精神和三民主義的精神力量，計算在戰爭力量之內，就以爲憑他優勢的武力和物質力量，一舉就可以壓制中國，殊不知此次中日戰爭，不是普遍的國際戰爭，而是中華民族完成國民革命求得自由平等的革命戰爭。這種革命戰爭，物質和武力，不過是勝敗所關的條件之一，而決定戰爭勝敗的主要條件，還是精神——就是革命主義，只是我們對於主義的信仰不搖動，主義的力量不消滅，任何暴力都不可滅亡我們，何況我們五千年悠久光榮的歷史，和偉大高尚的文化，我們有四萬萬五千萬時同胞，和四千萬方里的土地，以我們革命精神，運用這些優越的條件，十八個月抗戰，已足驚醒日本狂妄侵略的迷夢，他不僅不能遠到不戰而屈我的目的，就是傾其全力要求連戰速決亦不可能。我相信抗戰以後，不僅日本不敢再來侵略我們。世界上對于估計戰爭力量的標準，也要跟著改變，至少可使和平更得主尊重和保障</p>
<p>我們此次對日抗戰，初期雖不免挫失，但一切勝利條件和必勝的基礎，我們樣樣具備，只要本黨同志領導四萬萬同胞一心一德，團結一致，在一個主義一個政府的領導之下，努力奮門，前進不懈，不僅一個日本不能奈何我們，就是三倍四倍于現在日本的力量，也不能打敗我們，我們抗戰一定勝利，中華民族一定復興。</p>
<h3>完成我們的神聖使命</h3>
<p>— 科</p>
<p>時光荏苒，現在又是中華民國二十八年開始的時候了！大家所憶念的，當然是這一年零六個月的神聖抗戰；大家所追求的，當然是今後光明燦爛之前途，我們不能認爲過去的都一定滿意，但起禍可以這樣說：抗戰總是令人滿意！抗戰是爲了求國家的獨立，民族的解放，四萬萬五千五黃帝子孫的自由平等，抗戰本身的重要價值，當然會使任何人謳歌讀偑，而且「抗戰即是革命」，吾人之不能懷疑抗戰，即吾人之不能懷疑革命，實具同一之意義，</p>
<p>但是抗戰並不是爲了抗戰而抗戰，抗戰只是手段，並不是目的。我們的目的，乃在建設一個三民主義的新中國，因爲三民主義的新中國，是因際平等（民族主義），是政治平等（民權主義），是政治平等（民權主義），是經濟平等（民生主義）抗戰便是在打倒日枯帝國主義的侵略勢力，並進而謀民族主義，民權主義，民生主義之全部實現。因此，大家所追求的，乃爲「抗戰必勝，建國必成」的光明燦爛之新中國前途！</p>
<p>怎樣去實現這個前途呢？</p>
<p>這便是我們大家的任務！</p>
<p>目的既然懸在我們的前面，責任既然擱在我們每一個人的肩上，今後大家著力之墾，惠該注意下列幾件事：</p>
<p>第一，要具有民族自尊心和自信心的堅強信愈。我們並不否認中華民族已具有若干弱點，已暴露了許多敗德，但五千多年的歷史文化的悠久，這是任何一國所趕不上的；中國人愛和平，重信義，耐勤儉的風習，也比任何民族都優異；中國人並不比西洋人愚昧，中國人天賦的聰明才智，的確是超人一等，不過因爲敎育程度之不普及，及政治經濟社會各方面尚未達到近代化的水準，所以尚呈顯看許多缺點，這也是中國所以被強×侵略壓迫的原因。惟侵略壓迫正可視爲警覺我們，敎訓我們，改善我們的唯一機會！我們絕對不能夠動搖自已對民族自尊心和自信心的堅強信念！假使自已對自已國家民族的信念，根本發生動搖，那只戰宣佈精神破產，宣佈屈膝投降，乾乾脆脆降志辱身去做帝國主義的俘虜，去做日本人的奴隸好了！這種喪失了自信的人，在民族說是應該淘汰的渣滓，在個人說是天下第一等的蠢才。</p>
<p>第二，要具有對目前軍事政治有澈底了解和樂觀的心情。有些人爲什麼對時局悲觀，對抗戰前途發生懷疑？甚至希望妥協求和呢？這無疑的由於他們封軍事政治外交的前途，估計不清，觀察不明所致。當然我們他不否認這一年多的喪師失地情形，是失敗而不是勝利：但要知道事事落後的弱小民族對帝國主義之抗戰，這失敗是必所難免之事。假使我們沒有失敗的定形勢在先，日帝國主義者也根本不會來橫施侵略了！所以抗戰一起，所爭者乃爲最後之勝利，而非一地一城之得失，及速戰速決之優劣。怎樣去爭取最後勝利呢？蔣委員長已經明白說過：是爭的「持久戰」，是爭的「全面戰」，是爭的「主動戰」；目前正是全面戰的展開，持久戰與主動戰開始的時候。我們所爭者，乃是在目前這種階段里面，去怎樣消耗×人？怎樣困斃×人？必須經過一定時期之後，才能夠以大的反攻來決定最後之勝利。所以就現階段的戰略來說，根本用不著悲觀，同時，是只有樂觀的，軍事上，一切進入有利的形勢；敗政上，除了努力生產，以平衡匯價，最近又得到英美借款的支持；外交上，國附形勢約積極好轉，更屬有目共睹之事，再看×人：他們一般國民反戰情緒之增高，他們兵員的補充已發生根本問題；他們財政更是羅掘已窮，崩潰在即；至於外交之孤立失助，行遭見重大之打擊，其困難更不待論。所以我們從任何方面看，都是樂觀的—我們固然有許多地方已感覺到捉襟見肘，其實×人比我們捉襟見肘的地方更多，我們爲什麼只看重×人而看輕自已呢！一切動搖的觀念，悲觀的情緒，大家應該澈底把他克服！澈底把他肅清！</p>
<p>第三，要有刻苦自勵，咬定牙根的吃苦精神和奮門精神，前面已經說過：我們所爭取的是「最後勝利」，大家便要知道：越「最後」，則其所經過之困難越多，所遭受之痛苦越大。戰爭，本來是「不得已而爲之」，人類所求的是和平，而並不是戰爭，其所以不得已而出於抗戰之一途者，原在爲民族求生存，為國家爭獨立而義無反顯。在此意義之下，只要是對民族國家有益，只要具所付之犠牲代價，足足有裨於民族之生存，國家之獨立，凡是任何落難困苦，我們都只好拚命忍受下去—所以我們希望全國的同胞和同志們，無論在前方或在後方，無論是出錢更好，或出力也好，總得咬定牙關，吃苦到底；同時要以「死里求生」之精神去作有×無我之門爭。現在有的人因爲促在西南一隅，因爲懷想到家鄉淪陷，畢業蕩然，因爲日感生活之壓迫，處境之不易，於是由平時養尊處優之心情，生出此時妥協投降之觀念，這是一個最堪恥辱的現象。其實，就目前的許多事實觀察，似乎除了前×將士而外，後方的人何嘗吃了些什麼苦頭？我們只見著畸形的繁榮，只見著無謂的浪費，那里趕得上歐戰時那般國家的嚴格統制—那里趕得上歐戰時那般國民的節衣糧食—中國目前追種情形，誠然是病態，誠然須得力加矯正，但另一方面正表現中國的地大物博，蘊藏豐富，經濟彈性力之大，遠非日帝國主義者所能堅其項背，只要大家吃苦，只要人家洞遠人生的真義，能把個人的生活標準，生活慾望，加以調節，同時以其力，以其財盡量貢獻給國家，那麼，不要說與×人打三年五年，但是十年八年，以至百年戰爭，中國都盡有力量可以撐持下去—問題即在我們能吃苦，肯奮門。</p>
<p>第四，要以抗戰建國綱領來作爲我們刻苦奮門的唯一目標，長期抗戰本來是一個極艱苦卓絕的工作，而其所以艱苦卓絕者，不在抗戰之本身，尤在抗戰與建國之同時並進，本黨臨時全國代表大會宣言。對於這一點說得最爲清楚—吾人當竭其全力爲國家民族爭取生存興猶立，同時根據三民主義，繼續不斷完成政治上經濟上之建設，俾中國獲得自由平等於世界，吾人亦知人國目前若昨得和平之環境，則此等建設完成當校易，然日本帝國主義之侵略，著著深入。使和平歸於絕望，此次抗戰，在事勢上爲必然發生，且無可避免，吾人不能望於和平中間建設。惟當使抗戰與建設。同時並行，是則救亡的責任，實同時落於吾人之肩上。至於如何抗戰建國呢？三民主義是我們最高指導原則抗戰建國竊領是我們原理原則的實行方針，現在我們所要檢討的，即是這些抗建綱領，究竟實踐了沒有？或貴綫了幾分之幾？我們所要努力的，即是怎樣樣戰時建國工作發展襄戰事停止後便會一變而爲民族復興的政治基礎和經濟基礎，譬如說戰時的國營貿易，工曠調整等，在戰後即在達到發達國家資本，節制私人資本之目的戰時的參政制度，兵役制度等，在戰後即能遠到民權主義，地方自治，自由徵兵之目的，……總之，我們在此一面抗戰，一面建國的奮門過程中，要時時刻刻都不能離聞我們的綱領，要時時刻刻都在爲實現三民主義而努力。</p>
<p>根據上述各點，第一堅決了對自已民族的自尊心和自信心，於是他「有所本」了—第二澈底䜍然於×我之情況，而心安理得，于是他「不動搖」了一第三抱定犠牲奮門，到底不懈之決心與×人作持久戰，於是「最後勝利」屬於我了—第四本著一定的方針目標努力幹下去，於是在戰時不虞「崩潰」一，戰後可以「復興」了——這樣，便是我們光明燦爛之前途—大衆必須急起直追，來完成我們的神聖使命！</p>
<h3>民族意識之增進與擴大</h3>
<p>— 王寵惠</p>
<p>抗戰以來，因強×之侵略而促成我國之團結與進步，其事例最顯著者，則民族意識之增進是也。×人數—年來，蓋以推進其所請大陸政策，宰割吾國疆土分化進而至於消滅我民族爲其唯一無上之目的，故甲午戰役以來，吾國朝野雖切感民族之侵陵，邊圍之不固，及帝國主義之澎湃，不無焦慮，惟×人之欲實行其大陸政策，在此數十年間，因其操待政柄者對於實行步驟觀察之不同，因之其取舍之途頓異，或主案騙，例若幣原，或主硬奪，例若田中，然殊途同歸同，終是一邱之貉，除併大吾國爲其究竟目的外殊無他項旨趣，可斷言也，因其如此，吾國修明內政加強國防力量以抵抗外來強力之侵略，殆成爲一致呼聲，然此種意識，在蘆溝橋事件未發生前，僅能到連於或種階級，而一般民衆對于此種意識尚不甚強，此其理由，以身負政治責任者及社會或敎育界有知識之分子，對于此種情勢，觀察較清，而一般民衆對此直接尚未感受何等影響，有之惟東四省已受×人壓迫之民衆，至其餘各省，所感初不甚深，乃至知識低下階級，或無所感動，而今則與昔大異其趣十八個月期間，×人進攻吾國以後經過每一地方之淫虐與舉行，中外報紙，及確切調切之見於書冊者幾難縷計，×軍閥及柄政者橫蠻醜肆之詞，及蔑視世界任何國家，撕毀神聖條約，鏟除第三國權益之行動，亦屢見不一見，其結果不僅世界集體安全之國家，對於暴×之侵略及與世界爲敵行動，已有深刻之認識，即吾國一般民衆，亦已明瞭全國上下共禦外侮一致救國實有急切之必要。故各地民衆，以×之侵入，組織力量起而抗禦者屢有所聞，即在無組織地方，民衆力能予敵以懲創者亦時時可見。不僅如此。各黨努力。各派，各團體各方面，對於，戴中央抗戰建國之一點上，均已示其最大決心并表現其最大由是以觀，強×此次對吾國之侵略，不僅不能分化我國併吞我國，反以促我國民族意識之增進而已。</p>
<p>然而吾人對此，殊不能即認爲滿足，吾人已體難由強×侵陵吾民民族意識儼有顯者之增進，吾人當基於此種增進狀態，更加努力，求其所以更加擴大民族認識方法，以抗禦×人，以完成抗戰建國之偉大使命。吾人當此危急存亡之際。國家民和譬如站在十字街頭，進一步則生，退一步則死，不抗戰則不能建國，惟有抗戰同時即是建國，不復興，即覆滅，故祇有集合全國各黨各派各團體各方面各廠級民衆力量，在最高嶺袖指導之下，擴大民族意識，與×人作殊死戰，收復我既淪喪之土地，拯救我淪陷區域被難同胞，䡱逐×人於域外，庶幾新中國之建設可共觀成。際茲新歲，謹舉此語以告愛國人人，用代賀語</p>

<h3>U.S. Sends Note to Japan Rejecting Plan to Dominate the Far East; Ready to Express Economic Retaliation</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 31st Dispatch] It is learned that the United States has drafted a note and will have it delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry today by U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, rejecting Japan's "New Order" plan for the Far East, reiterating the U.S. emphasis on respecting treaties, and preparing to participate in international conferences to properly resolve Far Eastern issues.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 31st Dispatch] The American Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin has expressed growing concern due to the announcement by the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce yesterday of discriminatory treatment toward some American goods, and has listed recent cases of hostile treatment of individual goods. Political circles here generally consider this matter very serious. If the Japanese do not change their attitude, the U.S. may express itself in economic terms. It is reported that the U.S. government has decided to protest to Japan, demanding that American goods be treated distinctly from Chinese goods. Furthermore, the full text of the note will be published after U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo, Grew, announces that it has been properly delivered to the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>Arita and Yonai Publicly Declare the Necessity of Encompassing the Western Pacific</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] Japanese Prime Minister Konoe held talks with several important ministers yesterday. It is reported that the discussion focused on the principles held by Konoe in China, as stated in his recent declaration. According to well-informed sources, the final policy regarding Japan will be submitted to a cabinet meeting on January 6th for a decision.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and Naval Minister Yonai stated in their New Year's messages that Japan intends to eliminate the Western powers' view of the Far East as their colony, and therefore Japan must seize leadership of the Western Pacific. Arita stated that Japan intends to eliminate the old concept of Western capitalism turning the East into a colony. He also attacked the great powers, praising Germany's attitude towards Japan, and said, "Other countries do not recognize the actual situation in eastern Asia, and there are even some countries that make unreasonable demands without regard for the actual situation, so it is necessary to correct this misunderstanding." Yonai said, "The assistance of third countries to General Chiang Kai-shek is an unfriendly attitude towards Japan and a plan to interfere with Japan's actions in China. The revival of China is only possible under the protection of the military, so Japan must obtain the leadership of the Western Pacific."</p>
<h3>Government Forces in Western Country Launch Full Counteroffensive; Madrid Under Heavy Night Air Raid; Naval Battle at Gibraltar</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Barcelona, 31st Dispatch] Government forces launched a counteroffensive in the southern part of Lerida Province at 10:30 this morning, and are now advancing along the Segre River towards Saragossa. Saragossa is a major communication route less than three miles from the government forces' front line. If government forces can capture that location, they will control the rebel forces' rear transportation line for attacks toward Brunks. According to the government forces, the Italian army divisions in this area are in serious danger of having their lines of communication cut off. Transportation in this war zone is favorable to the government forces because the government forces' wing units can be protected by fortifications along the Segre River. The rebel forces are vulnerable to counterattacks by government forces from the Atala region, and the government forces are in a stronger position in other sections as well.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 31st Dispatch] From 8:00 last night to 1:05 this morning, there was continuous bombing, killing five people and injuring thirty. The southeastern area of Vasquez suffered the most damage. [Reuters, Saragossa, 30th Dispatch] This location acknowledges that government forces launched a fierce counteroffensive on the southern front yesterday. Furthermore, Franco's headquarters stated that rebel forces advanced from Granada earlier today, occupying the town of Bobla, and built a fortress on the bridgehead across the Canal River. Rebel forces at the fortress south of the bridge at Pla de Ize broke through the government forces' defense line and continued to push toward the Camara Han region. They also stated that the rebel forces had cut off the highway from Beinavente to Sivo Sigel.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gibraltar, 30th Dispatch] Official sources here have issued a declaration regarding the conflict in Gibraltar harbor between Spanish and rebel forces, stating that four sailors on the government forces' destroyer "Chrodes" were killed and seven were injured, one of whom later died in the hospital. Reuters has learned that the deceased will be buried at sea, with the "Chrodes" monitor participating in the funeral. The casualties on the rebel side are currently unknown.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] The Spanish rebel forces today issued a declaration regarding the battle in Gibraltar harbor, stating that only one rebel mine-laying ship and the gunboat "Volcano" participated in the conflict, but did not mention any casualties. Later, more detailed reports from the Gibraltar side stated, "No rebel ships were sunk."</p>
<h3>Hitler Issues New Year's Message to the German People; Hopes to Contribute to International Peace in the Coming Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 31st Dispatch] Hitler issued a New Year's message to the German people, listing three major accomplishments to be urgently realized: (1) to cultivate the spirit of national unity under the National Socialist Party among all the people; (2) to establish and strengthen the nation's military power; (3) to continue completing the Four-Year Plan to solve the labor shortage, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of newly acquired territories. He then discussed Germany's relations with other countries, stating briefly, "Regarding foreign policy, Germany's position has been thoroughly explained. Our friendship with Fascist Italy is particularly clear to the public and should be inviolable. Mussolini's great achievements in maintaining peace over the past year have a significant place in historical fact, and we can only express our deep gratitude for this. We should also express our gratitude to other politicians who jointly seek paths to peace and solutions. Our foreign policy attitude can be summed up in one sentence: the Anti-Comintern Pact. Beyond that, our only hope is to be able to contribute to international peace in the coming year. May God bless us to achieve this goal."</p>
<h3>Germany Demands Equal Submarine Tonnage from England; England Asks Germany to Explain Reasons; Negotiations Currently Underway in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] It has been learned that Germany has sent a note to the British government stating its intention to build submarines in accordance with the "Anglo-German Naval Agreement," with a total tonnage equal to that of British submarines. The two sides are currently negotiating in Berlin based on the provisions of the "Anglo-German Naval Agreement." According to the "Anglo-German Naval Agreement," the total tonnage of the German navy must be limited to 35% of the total tonnage of the British navy, and the total tonnage of submarines must be limited to 45% of the total tonnage of British submarines. Germany may increase its total submarine tonnage to match Britain's if it deems it necessary, but before doing so, it must first conduct friendly consultations with the British government. It is reported that among the British representatives sent to Berlin for negotiations on this matter, there are plans to ask Germany what specific changes in circumstances necessitate the request to increase submarine tonnage. The British delegation has already raised several points, requesting Germany to explain them, hoping that through these consultations, Britain can reach a consensus with Germany. The total tonnage of British submarines is currently about 70,000 tons, while Germany's is about 25,000 tons. If Germany increases its submarine tonnage, Britain will inevitably have to re-examine the tonnage of other types of submarines, as the total tonnage of the German fleet should still be 35% of the British fleet. Furthermore, the scope of the Berlin talks will also include the armament of Germany's two new cruisers.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 31st Dispatch] According to reports from Guilin, Germany's intention to increase its submarine and cruiser fleet is to counter the Soviet Union's construction program, but this news has caused alarm in Britain, as the terrible impression of German submarines attacking British ships during the Great War in Europe has not yet faded.</p>
<h3>U.S.-German Relations on the Brink of Rupture; U.S. State Department Officials Refuse to Criticize German Government's Order for Newspapers to Attack the U.S.</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 31st Dispatch] U.S.-German relations are on the verge of rupture, as German sources say that there is no basis for the hope of improving U.S.-German relations. Hitler's official newspaper also stated that the U.S. is insistent on provoking conflict with the German people, and Germany is eager to seek peace with the U.S., but it will never trust most Americans or allow the government to implement its current reckless policies.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th Dispatch] The "People's Observer" here continues to attack the U.S., stating that Germany could easily import 3-4 million bales of U.S. fabric each year, but this depends on the U.S.'s "commercial policies and obstinacy." The newspaper also mentioned President Roosevelt's appeal for peace to Hitler in September, when Roosevelt said that the peaceful resolution of hundreds of millions of people is mankind's noblest historical contribution. The newspaper said that President Roosevelt no longer remembers his previous words, so he lets Hull, Ickes, Pittman, and others spout nonsense.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 30th Dispatch] Today, German newspapers, with official authorization, published a statement saying that if U.S.-German relations are influenced by forces seeking Jewish interests, there is no hope for improvement. This is the first time that German newspapers have published Germany's protest against U.S. Interior Secretary Ickes' speech and the U.S. State Department's refusal to apologize. Since the publication of this statement, German authorities seem to have ordered newspapers to attack the U.S. The People's Observer editorial stated, "The U.S. State Department's implicit approval of Ickes' malicious insults shows what the future holds for U.S.-German relations under the current authorities in Washington. The failure of the U.S. at the Pan-American Conference may be the reason for its anti-German sentiment, and its attacks are an attempt to shift internal blame. The Washington authorities clearly want to create tension in U.S.-German relations in order to justify the need for a large-scale military expansion to the American people." Outside reports say that relations between the two countries may be severed after the newspaper attacks, but well-informed sources deny this possibility, saying that various anti-American movements have been suppressed over the past week to avoid disturbing the Christmas holiday between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Second Round of British-Italian Talks; Italian Newspapers Say Important Discussions Will Take Place; Chamberlain and Others to Depart on the 12th</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 30th Dispatch] British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will travel to Nice on January 12th to lay a wreath at the Italian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before holding their first talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. That evening, Prince Colonna, the Governor of Rome, will receive the distinguished British guests, followed by a banquet hosted by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The British delegation will hold a second round of talks with the Italian Prime Minister on the 13th. Italian newspapers predict that further talks between Britain and Italy will be necessary because there are important issues that need to be discussed.</p>
<h3>The New Situation on the Pacific After One and a Half Years of War</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiyuan</p>
<p>China's war of resistance against Japan is not only a war for the entire Chinese nation to seek its own independence and freedom of development, but also a war to maintain the balance of land-based interests in the Pacific. In other words, the war of resistance is, on the one hand, for the ultimate survival of China itself, and on the other hand, it fulfills the task of a watchdog for the European and American powers that have vested interests in eastern China. This is a common understanding among international political commentators worldwide who love peace and have fair minds.</p>
<p>After one and a half years of war, the facts have proven the correctness of this observation. At present, the vast markets and existing vast interests of Western powers in the Far East mainland have been subjected to the control of Japanese warlords and the seizure and destruction by Japanese militarists for no reason. However, if we analyze with sharper and broader vision, we can say that the organizational power of the new powers in the Far East is constantly developing and strengthening, while all the forces of Japan in the Pacific and on the Far Eastern mainland are constantly moving towards a process of decline and weakening. The executioner of the East - Japan - this is the new situation and new order created on the Pacific today.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The basic characteristic of this new situation is the continuous increase in China's war resistance forces, while Japan's losses are extremely heavy.</p>
<p>According to the report of our supreme leader, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, our strength has increased thirtyfold in the past year and a half. Our military organization, based on maintaining 250 national defense divisions, is largely in place, and includes many new mechanized units. Furthermore, we have established a stable foundation for long-term war in terms of economic construction, political facilities, cultural work, diplomatic operations, and the application of strategy. Not only can there be "light at the end of the tunnel" in terms of finance and the supply of national and military necessities, but the compromising forces within China's political arena are also gradually establishing themselves overseas, the front line is becoming more solid, and the force of resistance against Japan is becoming more concentrated.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we observe the interior of Japan, we can fully expose a state of being overwhelmed and struggling to advance or retreat. The mobilization of troops has reached two-thirds of its total troop resources (approximately 1.5 million), the number of casualties has reached around 600,000, and the loss of aircraft is approximately one-quarter of its total number of aircraft (approximately 600 aircraft). The naval losses are relatively small, but the combined number of large and small warships is also over 50 vessels. In terms of finance, there is an even more severe shortage of funds. More than half of the national income has been plundered by the Japanese militarists to support the war effort against China. The currency reserve rate has been reduced to 25%, and prices have increased by an average of 30% to 65%. Existing military supplies have also been almost exhausted, and they have to buy scrap metal everywhere with letters of credit to rush to produce new goods for resupply. The experienced elder statesmen of Japan can only remain silent when they see the development of this situation. The thoughts and movements of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment are spreading deep into the people. No matter how clever the Japanese militarists' tricks are, no matter how much the Japanese militarists use the emperor's decree to force parliament to pass all wartime laws, its internal collapse is clearly exposed!

<h3>Summary of the First Phase of the War of Resistance and Prospects for the Second Phase (II)</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's seventh page)</p>
<p>Secondly, the mass movement for adding troops and the political work in the army have been universally applied to the Fifth Route Army and other central units under the good influence of the Eighth Route Army. There is now a political department under the Military Commission, and political departments have been established in various army divisions and regiments. The establishment of the Mass Mobilization Committee and the Mass Training Department has especially contributed a lot to the war of resistance. Thirdly, the armed mass movement began to be implemented in the Soviet area, the Jin-Cha-Ji area, and Guangxi. The anti-Japanese guerrilla war has also begun to develop in various occupied areas across the country. In particular, the establishment of the Jin-Ji-Lu Border Anti-Japanese People's Government in the Jin-Cha-Ji anti-Japanese base area in North China, and the cooperation between the Military Commission's Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army and the New Fourth Army in the Jiangnan area to delete the Soviet-Zhe-Wan Border Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base, etc., and the people's anti-Japanese regime and guerrilla forces in these places have successively established closer ties with the central government. Secondly, in</p>
<p>Political Aspects</p>
<p>First, our highest authorities and patriotic masses across the country have shattered the plots of peace settlement and foreign mediation stirred up by Japanese traitors after the fall of Nanjing, the fall of Xuzhou, and even the defense of Yuehan, and have strengthened their determination to unite and resist Japan to the end. The Japanese have suffered a great blow to their plan to quickly conquer China by provoking separation, dividing China, and destroying the war of resistance. Second, the anti-Japanese national united front has been further consolidated and expanded! The main reason is the formal close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the two largest political parties in the country. Following this, the Third Party, the National Youth Party, and the National Socialist Party, among others, joined hands under the banner of the "Anti-Japanese Political Party Union." The leaders of the National Salvation Association, who made the first practical efforts to mobilize domestic unity and resist foreign aggression, continue to work in government agencies, mass movements, or opinion circles. They have never left the masses - Third, the political institutions have begun to be transformed to meet the needs of the war of resistance - on the eve of New Year's Day in 1938, the central government carried out partial reorganization and personnel adjustments. On the one hand, it streamlined redundant institutions, such as the merger of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, the merger of the Economic and Construction Commissions into the Ministry, and the abolition of empty agencies such as the Ministry of the Navy. On the other hand, it established the Ministry of Mass Training. Communist leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, etc., joined the Military Commission as members. Subsequently, seventy-five seats were added to the National Defense Council to accommodate representatives from various parties, Mongolia and Tibet, and overseas Chinese. In addition, the newly established Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Political Affairs, and Ministry of Social Affairs after the war of resistance have also had their work widely praised at home and abroad. The local political institutions in various provinces and cities have also been improved in dozens of places such as Hubei and Hunan. Fourth, the Kuomintang's prestige among the masses has been greatly enhanced, especially the provisional national congress in April 1938, which decided to establish a presidential system, elected Mr. Chiang Kai-shek as the party's president, and resolved to establish the Youth League to unify the national youth movement. The Kuomintang has begun to move towards a healthy path. In particular, the formulation of the program for resisting aggression and building the nation was taken as the Kuomintang government's policy during the war of resistance, and was protected by the masses across the country. Fifth, the prestige of various anti-Japanese parties, especially the Communist Party, among the masses is also growing stronger. The Communist Party is not afraid of danger in all occupied areas, and cooperates closely with Kuomintang comrades to fight and establish anti-Japanese regimes, destroy, pseudo-rule and its development work, and has made outstanding achievements. Sixth, the establishment and convening of the National Senate, which is the prototype of a civil opinion organ, are important. In particular, the first congress, which opened on July 6 and ended on the 16th, represented 450 million compatriots and reaffirmed the national policy of "resisting aggression to the end and striving for the final victory of the nation and the nation," and announced the principle of "the anti-Japanese national united front of cooperation between all parties, factions, and sectors," and "working together under the leadership of the Supreme Commander Chiang Kai-shek to strive for the final victory and achieve the success of nation-building." In terms of society and economy, such as relief to refugees, relief to the unemployed and out-of-school, financial stability, fiscal consolidation, westward movement of manpower and material resources in the southeast, and development of economic and transportation construction in the west, all have been quite successful after sixteen months of war of resistance. The most important is</p>
<p>(International relations)</p>
<p>We have also made considerable efforts. First of all, due to the consolidation of China's anti-Japanese national united front, due to the firm determination of the Chinese government and the highest authorities to resist aggression for a long time, and due to the heroic resistance of the Chinese military and civilians against division, mediation, and compromise, international sympathy and assistance to us have greatly increased. Not to mention the sympathy and material, military, and personnel assistance from the entire Soviet Union, the people of Britain, the United States, and France have been constantly working hard on economic assistance, refugee relief, and boycotting Japanese goods. The League of Nations General Assembly has also accepted our country's proposal and unanimously resolved to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant and ask all countries to voluntarily assist China in sanctioning the Japanese aggressors. However, our achievements and progress in the first sixteen months of the war of resistance are still not enough to adapt to the need to strive for greater demands in the war of resistance to the end, and have made extremely serious mistakes and still left many</p>
<p>Shortcomings</p>
<p>Particularly important militarily are (1) insufficient combat strength and all equipment at the front; (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Counteroffensives on All Fronts; Guangzhou Shaken; Under Smoke Screen of Peace, Japan Actively Deploys; As New Year Begins, Military Experts Discuss the War Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 31st, 3 PM Dispatch] Since the beginning of the second phase of the war, loyal and brave soldiers on all fronts have been able to launch bloody counteroffensives and fiercely strike the Japanese. According to a certain military expert here, due to the approach of our army in northern Guangdong to the suburbs of Huaxuecheng and the annihilation of more than two regiments by our army in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River, Guangzhou is in a precarious situation. Moreover, the Japanese in Yueyang, northern Hunan, have also been thwarted by our army and are gradually attempting to reconnoiter. Looking at the overall southwestern war situation, it can be confidently asserted that the Japanese forces are exhausted and are on the verge of a quagmire. As a result, the current war situation seems relatively calm, but this is not a standstill. The Japanese army's attempts to invade western Hunan, advance from northern Guangdong, and move south from Yueyang are still being actively plotted and deployed. Furthermore, whenever Japan is carrying out an invasion plot or reorganizing its troops, it always uses malicious diplomatic propaganda and makes false claims about peace. This is truly a deceptive, absurd, and shameless act towards the world. In short, our army has become stronger and stronger in recent battles, and all kinds of Japanese attempts will eventually become dreams.</p>
<h3>Tensions on Shaanxi Border; Japan Attempts to Cross the Yellow River in Western Shanxi but Fails</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th Dispatch] After the recovery of Dongyumen, most of the Japanese forces collapsed at Zhangjiatan, Shijiatan.

The Japanese plainclothes team that had infiltrated has been cleared by our troops. There are no Japanese troops within 35 li of the village. There is no apparent movement of the Japanese in Daning. The Japanese in Sanxi Po Sanhou Township, Ningjian, have been attacked and contained by our troops for days, and have been unable to continue their advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Liulin, 31st Dispatch] (1) The Japanese in western Shanxi have recently launched three routes of attack. One route is from Lishi to Zhangjiazhuang, southeast of Mengmen. Another route is along the highway to Xiazixu, 15 li east of Liulin. The other unit is to Jialing, 20 li south of Liulin. Each route has approximately 700 infantry and cavalry engaged in fierce fighting. (2) Approximately 1,000 Japanese troops, more than ten mountain guns, eight war vehicles, and fourteen heavy trucks have been continuously increasing in Baotou. There are definite signs of an active westward movement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berkeley, 30th Dispatch] Newspapers here have reported that a large number of Japanese troops have been continuously transferred from North China to Manchuria.

Chinese guerrillas have been spotted in the Yuhuatai area south of the city. Their outposts occasionally approach the South Gate and chat with the puppet police guarding the city gate, acting naturally. The Japanese army has not dared to step out of the city. Chinese Air Force planes also fly to Nanjing from time to time to bomb the city. On the 30th, several planes dropped four bombs on the Japanese military police headquarters at dawn, all of which exploded. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties.</p>

<h3>Complete Text of Chairman Chiang's Address (Continued from the Seventh Edition on the 30th)</h3>
<p>They want to tie our hands and feet, strangle our blood, and want China to betray its faith and righteousness, and help them achieve their delusion of dominating East Asia and even controlling the world. May I ask: Our China has been founded for five thousand years, and has always taken faith and righteousness as the foundation of the country. How can we be threatened by them and abandon our position? The spirit of our founding is not to insult the widowed and lonely, nor to assist the violent and strong, and especially not to betray alliances or destroy mutual resistance. I remember that in the early years of the Republic of China, Tanaka Giichi met with our Premier in Shanghai. At that time, the European War was taking place. Tanaka said, "We in East Asia should get rid of all established relations with foreign countries and create a new system." The Premier asked him, "Wouldn't this destroy international treaties?" Tanaka said, "Isn't it very beneficial to China to destroy international treaties and break unequal relations?" The Premier resolutely rejected him, saying, "The abolition of unequal treaties must also be done in a dignified and legitimate manner. If we illegally destroy treaties, even if it is beneficial to our country, we will not do it."</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, this is the spirit of China, this is the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. We resist the war according to this spirit, we resist all unjust power and violence with this spirit, and we must also use this spirit to restore order in East Asia and contribute to the permanent peace of the world.</p>
<p>In short, this war is one in which Japan's spirit and morality have completely collapsed and fallen into violence. We have resolutely taken on the responsibility of world justice in a righteous war. The current warlords of Japan have lost their minds, indulged in their animal nature, and are running wild, able to break through all norms and destroy all human civilization and welfare. Originally, all countries in the world that have treaty responsibilities should open up the darkness and restore the light, and they should have the responsibility to sanction violence and maintain international treaties; but everyone is hesitating and hesitating. China only has to spare no sacrifice to shoulder the great responsibility of this righteous and world-shaking moment, which concerns the survival of public reason. This war of resistance is to achieve the purpose of the national revolution in our country. We seek China's independence, freedom, and equality; in the international arena, we want to uphold justice, restore treaty dignity, and rebuild a peaceful order. Our anti-Japanese war is a war between good and evil, between right and wrong - a war between public reason and power - a war between legality and conspiracy - a war between justice and violence. As our ancient saying goes: "Virtue is never solitary, it is sure to have neighbors." The power of public reason in the world will eventually rise, and all good people will eventually cooperate for justice. As long as we are determined, identify the target, and make a firm determination, the more sincere the hardship, the stronger, the more persistent, the more courageous; the whole country is of one heart, continues to work hard, and final victory will surely belong to us. I hope that our comrades and the soldiers and civilians of the whole country will work even harder to achieve success.</p>
<h3>Transportation Facilities Since the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Minister of Transportation Zhang Jia'ao</p>
<p>(2) Highways</p>
<p>Highway transportation is even more urgently needed after the fall of the railways. As the war developed, the Ministry increased the repair and construction of major trunk lines. The total length of highways built before the war, from the 20th year of the Republic of China to the 26th year, was 110,000 kilometers. After the war, from August of the 26th year to March of the 27th year, the most urgent highways built with special appropriations from the central government included more than ten lines in Hebei, Shanxi, and northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui, such as Haizhou, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Tangyin, Taiyuan, and Datong, totaling more than 1,500 kilometers. Other highways built directly by military authorities through provincial authorities are not included. For example, Jiangsu Province had already completed the main lines before the outbreak of the war, but after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, many branch roads in the war zone and along the Yangtze River and in southern Anhui were also temporarily built. In addition, the newly added routes in the northwest totaled more than 600 kilometers, and there were also 3,200 kilometers completed under the supervision of the Ministry with partial funding that could be opened to traffic. As for the roadside repair shops, stations, radio stations, telephones, and other equipment along the various roads, they have also been added one after another, and a factory for manufacturing automobile parts is being planned to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>In the future, the most important highway facilities will be the southwest and northwest highway systems. The important highways in the southwest provinces have now been taken over by the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration of the Ministry and opened to traffic one after another. In the northwest, the Northwest Highway Transportation Administration will take over the original highway engineering and transportation management matters in the northwest provinces and unify the authority. The bureau also has detailed plans and strict regulations for driver training, fuel saving, and vehicle repair, and is making practical improvements to enrich highway transportation in the southwest and northwest provinces.</p>
<p>The most important highway transportation for connecting international routes is the Yunnan-Burma Highway. From Kunming to Huidian in Burma, it is 964 kilometers long. Construction started at the end of the 26th year, employing 100,000 people and taking ten months to complete. It has started to be open to traffic. Furthermore, the Ministry can use manual and animal power for cargo transportation in the rear, promote export trade and increase foreign exchange funds, and has established a transshipment management office to handle this guide transportation. The first transshipment management office is now being set up on the Kunming-Xuzhou route, starting from this route. It is estimated that the daily transportation volume on this route can gradually increase to 100 tons. Depending on the results of the implementation, it will then be promoted to other routes such as the Sichuan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi routes to handle transshipment on each route to meet the needs of the times and replenish national power.</p>
<p>(3) Maritime Administration</p>
<p>Waterway transportation is extremely difficult due to the lack of ships. When the war broke out, the Ministry implemented blocking operations in Jiangyin, Huangpu, Zhangjiangkou, Zhenhai, Haizhou, the Pearl River Estuary, and the Madang area. The number of ships that were abandoned and sunk was very large, and the means of shipping became even more insufficient. A total of 99 ships were sunk, totaling approximately 140,000 tons, including 14 ships belonging to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, totaling 20,519 tons.</p>
<p>Regarding wartime waterway transportation, in order to coordinate and concentrate the use of resources, the Ministry jointly established the Yangtze River Shipping Joint Office with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and various private shipping companies to handle military requisitioning and the allocation of passengers and goods for all shipments on the Yangtze River and the sea. On the one hand, it ordered the establishment of inland river shipping joint offices by the shipping bureaus in various ports to control the inland river small ships within their respective jurisdictions. Since the implementation, it has been very effective. The most notable are the Yangtze River shipping line, the Guangdong-Hankou intermodal transport line, and the Hunan Province shipping line. These are described separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Yangtze River Shipping Line The Yangtze River shipping can be divided into two phases: (A) First Phase From January to mid-May, the ships in each section were concentrated. 1. Concentrated 14 Yuyi Hong ships (Hankou to Yichang dry season ships) on the Hankou-Yichang section; 2. Concentrated 11 Yuyu dry season ships on the Yichang-Wanxian section; 3. Concentrated 8 Xieyu ships on the Wanxian-Chongqing section; 4. Concentrated more than 200 wooden boats on the Yichang-Chongqing section. During this period, approximately 50,000 or more people were evacuated, more than 20,000 tons of military supplies and equipment were transported, and a total of 40,000 tons of government goods, private factory relocation equipment, and liquid fuel were transported.</p>
<p>(B) Second Phase From mid-May to the present, the ships in each section were concentrated. (1) Concentrated more than 16 Jianghai ships on the Hankou-Yichang section; (2) Concentrated 17 Sichuan River ships on the Yichang section, gradually concentrating a portion of the ships on the Yichang-Hankou section, and recently concentrating a portion of the small ships between Yichang and Fengjie and Yichang and Badong; (3) Concentrated more than 700 wooden boats on the Yichang-Chongqing and Yichang-Wanxian sections. During this period, approximately 100,000 or more people were evacuated, 90,000 tons of military supplies and equipment were transported, and more than 70,000 tons of government goods and private factory relocation equipment were transported.</p>
<p>(2) Guangdong-Hankou Intermodal Transport Line This line is divided into three sections: waterway transport between Hankou, Changsha, and Hengyang, railway transport between Changsha, Hengyang, and Qujiang, and waterway transport between Qujiang and Guangzhou. (1) Concentrated four Jiang ships between Hankou and Changsha; (2) Concentrated Beijiang tugboats between Guangzhou and Qujiang; (3) Concentrated shallow-draft ships and barges between Changsha and Hengyang. The transport results on this line include the evacuation of more than 50,000 people, the export of more than 5,000 tons of intermodal cargo, and the intermodal transport of more than 6,000 tons of domestic sales cargo.</p>
<p>(3) Hunan Province Shipping Line Divided into two lines: Hankou-Changde and Changsha-Changde. Concentrated more than 30 small Jiang ships and tugboats from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and more than 100 barges. The transportation results on this line, excluding the number of people, totaled more than 50,000 tons of military and relocated equipment.</p>
<h3>Denouncing Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>After reading Wang Jingwei's attention-grabbing telegram, I feel that this is actually a good phenomenon for the nation. This is because it proves two things. First, the stance of the Chief Pacifist faction is now clear. However, they harbored ulterior motives, long ago holding opinions and planning moves that were completely contrary to those of the entire party and the leadership of the government. They simply became a "microphone" for "friendly nations." The previous evasive statements, such as "My opinion is the opinion of all my comrades in the government, and Mr. Chiang's opinion," can now be seen as complete lies, containing not a single "honest word," but merely his own opinion. Now it's fully exposed. Second, no matter how capable he may be, since the eighteen months of resistance, he lurked in the core of China's resistance, engaging in various activities, tirelessly "deliberating deeply" on his "fundamental policy of Sino-Japanese friendship." Fortunately, the government did not waver in the slightest, forcing him to have no means to use his schemes, and ultimately leaving quietly. Witnessing the government's firm determination to resist, the unity of the entire nation's military and civilians, and the great achievements and progress in various aspects of the resistance over the years, from now on the battle lines are clear. The surrender advocates of the pro-Germany and Italy line of national subjugation have lost their basis. China's future of resistance will shine with boundless brilliance. The entire nation should be even more aware of this, the boundaries between friends and foes are clear, the belief in resistance is strengthened, and we will surely persevere through all difficulties and fight to the final victory. This is what Xiang Ning rejoices over and wishes to bless the nation's future.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of the friendship forged over thirty years of shared hardships, and to be faithful to the words we all said at the deathbed of the late Premier, I sincerely hope that this telegram was a result of him being confused by the north wind during his flight, or because a tapeworm had crawled into his heart, and not the honest words after clear-headedness and repeated "deliberation." Because it's too unlike what a Chinese person would say. The Premier's will was recorded in person by Ms. Song Qingling, and even after more than ten years, the words still resonate in our ears. Now, Wang Jingwei is pandering to foreign powers, seemingly unaware of how this affronts the late Premier, the martyred heroes, the tens of thousands of soldiers resisting, and the compatriots who have already been brutally murdered? If my sincere assumption that he is speaking deliriously due to illness is true, then Wang Jingwei should immediately issue a new statement, retracting all the nonsensical and outrageous remarks he previously made. He should return to Sichuan and reflect on his mistakes behind closed doors to apologize to the people and seek forgiveness from his ancestors. Otherwise, as Mr. Wang himself once said: Being a running dog of imperialism cannot be concealed by the three words "anti-Communist"...</p>
<p>In reality, Wang's telegram, in all its proposed points, uses vague wording, all stemming from how to execute the "proposals made by the Japanese government," echoing the Konoe Statement. It not only lacks any sense of national spirit but has also lost the conscience of a human being. There is no need to refute it point by point. But, to take a step back, let's examine its outline and its key points:</p>
<p>(1) Acknowledging the right of the Japanese to "freely" (meaning without any administrative or legal restrictions) "reside" (acquire land) and "operate businesses" (exploit our country's resources) in all parts of inland China. In other words, preparing to allow this "neighboring friendly nation" to infiltrate all Chinese territory like mercury seeping into the ground. In this case, Japan no longer needs concessions or consulates, as all of China has become a colonial region?</p>
<p>(2) Joint anti-communism, meaning handing over all the administrative police power in China to Japan. It must be understood that Germany and Italy are both ×× nations, each with guns and cannons, so "joint anti-communism" cannot interfere with each other's internal affairs. But China has long been a semi-colony, so how can you brazenly sue for peace and expect "non-interference in internal affairs"? To hand over China's internal affairs and administration entirely to others is not something that can be justified by such words! I completely agree with Mr. Chiang's words that "anti-communism" is actually weakening China. There is really no other explanation. Joint anti-communism is actually inviting others to weaken China.</p>
<p>(3) The so-called economic cooperation is simply "out of the question." Even the Anglo-American "Open Door Policy" has been shattered, so how can you, these semi-colonial slaves, "cooperate"?</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the troop deployment issue, I ask, what solution do you have, other than using long-term resistance to drive the × people out of the country? What does it mean to "allow the stationing of troops in specific locations during the anti-communist agreement, and at most limit it to areas near Inner Mongolia"? You signed the Shanghai Truce, the Tanggu Truce, and still think it's not enough, and want to unconditionally give the five northern provinces to others and smoothly incorporate them into the "Manchukuo" territory? How can you limit it to "at most"? What if people "limit" you when they make the limit? Is it that whatever the "proposals made by the Japanese government," you must implement them, while the opinions proposed by the Chinese people are not even worth a smile to you? Alas, six years ago, I heard people say that you were making sweeping remarks in Nanjing, saying, "Upon careful consideration, Qin Hui cannot be considered a traitor." I never thought that today you would truly follow in the footsteps of that infamous case –</p>
<p>However, what chills me the most is not these absurd statements. Any descendants of Yan and Huang who have a conscience and blood cannot bear to hear such things. I believe that the most dangerous thing is that this article reveals a very dangerous conspiracy, and people should pay close attention to it. What is it? First, the article deliberately presents itself as being from someone within the government, and deliberately avoids using anti-central government phrases. In reality, the spirit is to undermine the central government in every way, trying to make some unclear compatriots think with doubt that "I don't know how these construction governments will handle it." This form of "construction" is more poisonous than an ordinary "rebellion proclamation." Second, it is quite skilled at sowing discord between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and using this tactic to deal with certain elements in the two parties whose feelings are not very harmonious, trying to provoke a great disaster over the already unproblematic local administrative and military issues, so that the "neighboring friendly nation" can open a path to profit. Third, it is still desperately distorting the Three Principles of the People, deliberately smearing the Three Principles of the People, to shake the public's belief in the Three Principles of the People, in order to let the "benevolent rule of the friendly nation" take over people's hearts. Haven't you heard that in military strategy, "attacking the mind is the best"? Therefore, I sincerely urge friends and comrades from all circles and parties not to be misled by these fallacies. We must strengthen our trust in the government, strengthen our mutual unity, and further establish our belief in a Three Principles of the People China. What they want to do, we will not do; what they do not want us to do, we must intensify and strive to do.</p>
<p>Today, the battle lines are very clear. However, there are a few words that I want to offer to some old friends who remain in Hong Kong and Macao, especially those old comrades who are about my age. I have heard that Wang and his "neighboring friendly nation" are sending ××××××××××××× everywhere in Hong Kong and Macao to plot their scheme to sell their personality. I can vaguely imagine their skills in selling snake oil. Isn't it the same old trick? But for the sake of advising the world, I especially offer the following suggestions to share with my comrades!</p>
<p>First, at this critical juncture of national crisis, all past prejudices should be discarded one by one, and especially personal grievances with Comrade Chiang Kai-shek should be put aside. No matter what Comrade Chiang was like in the past, he is resisting the war today, and he is standing on the front line. For this point alone, we should fully support him. Don't take the wrong step, and especially don't fall for their old trick of "anti-Chiang grand alliance" and become a traitor.</p>
<p>Second, everyone should jointly sign a petition to immediately expel him from our party, lest he go to Nanjing to represent some party and talk to the × people. Everyone should no longer invite him to be the "President of the National Government." At the same time, they must be honest, save national currency, and maintain their integrity. ×××× understand the way of red money very well.</p>
<p>I advise my compatriots not to lose heart. The battle lines are even clearer, which is a good phenomenon. From now on, everyone should no longer have any doubts, but should unite as one and move towards the road to victory!</p>

<p>New Year's Message from This Newspaper</p>
<p>As the years change and everything is renewed, what words shall this newspaper offer to our readers as a New Year's greeting today? As we look back at our ancestral land and gaze upon our homeland, we see flames of war raging across the sky, barbarian cavalry overrunning the land, soldiers fighting fiercely in the snow and ice, and compatriots crying out on the brink of death. Yet, the ambitions of the × people have not been satiated, and the conspiracies of traitors are rampant. The nation is in greater danger than a pile of eggs. We truly have nothing to praise. However, if we can look into the distance with a broad vision, then we should see that the × people and traitors face heavy difficulties, their path is coming to an end, and they are facing imminent doom. On the other hand, as we look at our country, we see that our soldiers are fighting bravely on the front lines, growing more courageous and stronger as they fight. The people are cooperating in the rear, without doubt or hesitation, and without yielding or slackening. Internally, the dregs are being eliminated almost completely, unity is becoming stronger, and politics is leaping forward. Externally, all countries are united in sympathy, assistance is becoming more active, international standing is rising, the situation of resistance is gradually turning towards initiative and advantage, and the future of national construction has already revealed a glimmer of light. We live in this great era, and we are approaching great victory, so how can we have nothing to say?</p>
<p>Our nation's heroic resistance against the fascist aggression of Japan has lasted for eighteen months so far. The gains and lessons of the past eighteen months of resistance, as well as the current situation of resistance and the trends in resistance in the future, have been detailed in the article "Summary of the First Phase of Resistance and Prospects for the Second Phase of Resistance." We hope that readers will carefully review it. Today, what we wish to sincerely communicate to our readers and the officials in charge can be summarized into the following points:</p>
<p>The founding of the Republic of China has been going on for twenty-eight years. If these twenty-eight years were likened to a person, then they would be leaving childhood and adolescence and entering the era of youth, vigor, and accomplishment. However, our country has accumulated more than twenty years of internal strife and foreign aggression, leading to weakness and decline to the extreme. In the last seven or eight years, it has suffered fierce aggression from its powerful neighbor, fascist Japan, which has ultimately launched a nationwide effort to implement its plan of armed conquest of China. Therefore, the encounters and situation that our country faces today cannot be compared to the normal development sought by a young person. In order to seek independent survival, freedom, and happiness, our country had no choice but to rise up in resistance against a powerful × that was determined to destroy us. All the pain and difficulties that come should have been anticipated long ago and should not be a surprise. We had no choice but to rise up in resistance. All the pain and difficulties that come should have been anticipated long ago and should not be a surprise, and should not affect our strong will to resist. Yet, in the eighteen months of resistance, our internal affairs have already completed a unity unseen in twenty-eight years, and we have also restored our position in the international arena, which had been declining for nearly a century. And in our × country, fascist aggressor Japan, its military offensive has been stonewalled in China, its political crisis has deepened domestically, and its diplomacy is increasingly isolated internationally. Therefore, as we ask ourselves today, we should also know that we are not ashamed of the pioneers who created the Republic of China with difficulty and that we should raise our national self-esteem and self-confidence, persist in resistance to the end, overcome all pessimism and despair, and oppose any compromise or surrender conspiracy. It is with the blood of countless millions of soldiers and people that we have the glimmer of victory and light today, and we will never allow anyone to erase or betray it halfway, nor can we allow it. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The times are always moving forward, and history does not go backward. Our resistance today is not only to drive out the fascist forces of aggression in Japan and liberate our Chinese nation from death and chains, but also to take on the 5,000 years of civilized history of the Chinese nation and create a new China of independence, freedom, and happiness. In order to complete the prerequisite for resisting and building the nation, we must earnestly promote greater progress in military, political, cultural, and educational aspects. On the negative side, we must intensify our opposition to all defeatism, conservative thought, and feudal remnants that prevent our progress. We should relentlessly eliminate all double-dealers and corrupt forces. Any attempts at division and split, and any puppet government of traitors, are incompatible with our Three Principles of the People of resisting and building the nation, and must be thoroughly eradicated and eliminated. On the positive side, closer unity among all anti-Japanese parties and the people, and the absorption of those who have prestige among the masses and who are determined and experienced in resisting and building the nation are the main conditions for winning the resistance and building the nation in the future so that we can be free and independent in the new world. We should immediately urge them to achieve it. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Following the above two major principles, we would also like to briefly present specific opinions here to celebrate the progress of this twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China and to celebrate the new plans of this twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China. First, in terms of politics, as the name implies, today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, and the key to the Republic of China lies in the realization of democratic republicanism. Last year, the National Government clearly ordered all provinces and cities to establish senates on this New Year's Day, intending to promote democratic politics, and its benefits to the resistance are immeasurable. At present, most provinces have not been established on schedule due to special circumstances, except for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, etc. We sincerely hope that the government and the people will work together in the future to promote its complete realization. At the same time, close cooperation among all parties and circles is the foundation for guaranteeing the resistance and building the nation and it is urgent to properly discuss practical methods to prevent provocation and discord and establish solid organizations. In addition, improving political institutions, carrying out the movement to eliminate traitors, and uniting all ethnic groups in the country are all ways to strengthen the connection between the government and the people and the cooperation between military force and people's power. We deeply hope for further achievements. Second, in terms of military affairs, Generalissimo Chiang, President Sun, and Generals Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De have recently clarified how future resistance must be persistent, long-term, comprehensive, and proactive. However, how to promote this new strategy to the realm of victory depends on the concerted efforts of the front and rear and the occupied areas. If we increase the combat power of the main force, create new troops, transform the political work, equipment, and training of the troops, if we improve military technology, increase the construction of large-scale military industrial industries, if we extensively launch guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the war zones, and establish and consolidate anti-Japanese base areas, they are all preparations for the strategic counter-offensive in the future and are our urgent tasks today. Furthermore, in terms of economy, we have been able to steadily maintain an advantage over × for a year and a half, which is a true reflection of the government's efforts, but there are indeed regrets. How to earnestly implement wartime financial and economic policies in the future, increase income and save expenses, how to intensify wartime production and construction undertakings such as agriculture, industry, transportation, and cooperation in the western provinces, all await detailed planning and implementation. In order to stimulate the people's enthusiasm for resistance, the implementation of necessary improvements in people's livelihood should not be ignored, such as the relief of refugees and unemployed and out-of-school youth. There should be a comprehensive and active plan. Finally, regarding seeking foreign aid, in the current favorable international situation, we should do our best to promote it. We hope that in the future, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries will provide more active actions in assisting China and restraining Japan, and we must pay attention to military supplies, raw materials, medicine, technical talents, and financial assistance. The formation of an anti-aggression front between China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korean peoples should also have considerable achievements.</p>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee is scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. As the resistance and nation-building enter a new stage, we dare to offer the above points as a humble contribution. We believe that our readers will also have deep sympathy. Furthermore, this newspaper has been republished in the South for nearly a year. Since the change of format on the 5th of last December, it has been loved by all sectors, and the number of copies sold has increased sharply. However, the colleagues of this newspaper are increasingly aware of their shallowness, and there are still many areas that have not met expectations. In the future, we will work harder so as not to lose the purpose of this newspaper's more than sixty years of serving the people and the sincere hard work of the late general manager Shi Liangcai and his son Yonggeng, and to be a loyal member of the Chinese cultural community. At the beginning of this year, in addition to congratulating the New Year, we also ask for double the care and frequent guidance so as to correct our shortcomings. Then, wouldn't it be the good fortune of not only the colleagues of this newspaper!</p>

<h3>Commemorate New Year's Day with action! The Yuan Movement will be implemented starting today. The Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to all subordinate associations to promote it for a month. All fellow guilds will hold a New Year's Day group worship ceremony in solemnity.</h3>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China. Recalling this day twenty-eight years ago, Mr. Sun Yat-sen led the revolutionary martyrs, used their heads and hot blood to struggle arduously, and fought for freedom for the whole nation. Now our entire nation is using all its strength to wage war for the integrity of territory and sovereignty. Looking ahead and behind, the responsibility of our party has become even greater. Overseas Chinese and foreign friends in this port, including the press, schools, banks, stones, and shops, will be closed for two days today and tomorrow to show their celebration. In addition to holding group worship ceremonies, all overseas Chinese groups are working hard to manage the programs in everything due to the difficulties of the nation. Therefore, there are no grand celebrations. The situation is recorded as follows: The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce decided at the plenary meeting of all directors in December that the New Year's National Worship Conference will be held at 12:00 noon today on the fourth floor of the Chamber. However, in view of the frugality movement, the tea party facilities were canceled. At that time, Li Xingzhi, chairman of the Chamber, will give a speech to encourage members. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Christian Education Association will hold a car donation ceremony at the Public Works Bureau Sports Ground in Causeway Bay at 11:00 am today, and will also perform first aid and battlefield poison gas and first aid performances. The Student Elimination Association is scheduled to hold a charity art exchange fair at St. Paul's Boys' College in the Iron Gang at 10:00 am today. Mr. Wang Xiaoying will be invited to host the opening ceremony. The art order in the venue is extremely rich, and all income will be used as the fees for the return to the country service group. The Eastern District Teachers' Association is scheduled to open an art exhibition at Kong Sheng Hall at 1:00 pm tomorrow, and will print special brochures and sell flowers to raise accounts so that members and their families can promote mutual connection. In addition, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong launched a one-yuan debt repayment movement, and all overseas Chinese groups responded enthusiastically. Li Xingzhi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, proposed it for discussion at the fund-raising meeting. As a result, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would expand the promotion of this movement. The association requested all subordinate trade unions and townsmen's associations to act in unison. At the board meeting on the 29th, the detailed rules for handling this movement were decided. Yesterday afternoon, another special meeting was held at 2:30 to discuss the progress. As a result of the discussion, the one-yuan debt repayment movement was still handed over to the fund-raising committee of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce for handling. As for the various detailed rules that have been passed, it was decided to implement them starting today and ending on January 31, lasting for one month. The Chamber of Commerce rushed to send remittances to all subordinate associations yesterday to promote its implementation. Check the detailed rules (1 term) from the New Year's Day of the 20th year to January 31 of the 28th year of the Republic of China, lasting for one month, (2 the amount of debt repayment) is at least one yuan, and more is of course welcome, (3 fundraising methods) mobilize from household accounts, and do not hold it on the street or in public places, and do not force donations. If there is any act that goes beyond the scope of the topic and violates laws and disciplines, the association regrets not being responsible, (4 payment handling) each town and trade union will mobilize and remit the debt repayment funds directly to the Bank of China for collection and deposit, and at the same time report the results to the association by letter for publication in the newspaper. If there is anyone who does not belong to any trade union or organization, they can hand over the funds to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce for collection and remittance to the bank, and the association will issue a receipt.</p>
<h3>Wellington Street Fire Yesterday Morning: Three-Story Building Reduced to Rubble; Fire Carried by Wind, Nearly Affecting Neighbors; Losses of Ten Thousand Dollars; Fortunately, No Fatalities</h3>
<p>At 3:10 AM yesterday morning, a sudden fire broke out at No. 76 Wellington Street, Central, owned by Zhou Yu. The entire three-story building was engulfed in flames. With the north wind being fierce, the fire spread with the wind, turning the sky red. The buildings opposite and to the left on Pottinger Street, also owned by Zhou Yu, were also threatened by the flames. The terrifying scene was enough to make one lose color. The fire department dispatched as many as six engines to the scene to extinguish the fire, totaling eight hoses directed at the fire. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. The following is a summary of the situation based on investigations:</p>
<p>Investigation of Residents at the Fire Scene</p>
<p>No. 76 Wellington Street is an old-style, three-story building. The ground floor is occupied by Wai Wah Tailors, owned by Zhou Rui-nan, with eight partners. Zhou's family of five resided in the mezzanine at the rear of the shop. The shopfront to the left was rented to the Zhen Guang Jewelry, Gem, and Silverware Store, owned by Chen Bian, with three partners. The second floor was occupied by Dr. Lam Chak-yi, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and other tenants, totaling five households with nineteen people, including adults and children. The third floor was occupied by Hua Ping Girls' School, Principal Liang. To the right, at No. 74, the ground floor was occupied by Man Sun Chinese and Western Printing. The second and third floors were residential. Adjacent to the corner of Pottinger Street was a fruit stall owned by Hop Kee.</p>
<p>Sound Sleep Interrupted by Alarm</p>
<p>At 3:10 AM yesterday morning, the occupants of Wai Wah Tailors on the ground floor of No. 76 were sound asleep. They were unaware when the fire started. It was only when the flames blazed high that they were awakened. By then, the fire was raging and spreading everywhere. Everyone could only rush out the door to escape and sound the alarm. Residents on the second and third floors, as well as those in neighboring buildings, were also awakened from their dreams and hurriedly helped the elderly and carried the young, gathering their valuables and fleeing to the street.</p>
<p>Fierce Fire Affects Neighbors</p>
<p>Before long, all parts of the building were on fire. At a time when the wind was high and the weather was dry, and the building was an old-style structure with wooden stairs and floors, the fire spread rapidly once ignited. In about 20 minutes, the entire building was engulfed. Flames also spread to buildings on the west side of Pottinger Street, and the Hop Kee fruit stall at the street corner was also destroyed. The Biao Ji Food Store opposite had a cotton quilt set on fire, and the third floor opposite was also affected. Fortunately, the rescue was quick, preventing further disaster. A small part of the third floor of No. 74 to the right caught fire, but fortunately, it did not spread.</p>
<p>Efforts to Extinguish Fire Result in Injured Firefighters</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the Central Fire Station and the Western District fire substations dispatched fire engines, totaling six. However, as the fire occurred during water supply restrictions, firefighters had to wait for the Waterworks Department to open the water valve for about ten minutes after setting up the hoses before the water source arrived. During the efforts to extinguish the fire, a firefighter from Fire Brigade No. 44 was struck in the right eye by falling wood. By 4:10 AM, the fire had been somewhat contained, but the entire building had been burned to the top. Around 5:00 AM, the firefighters gradually packed up and returned to the station. Only an engineering vehicle remained at the scene to excavate.</p>
<p>Total Losses Exceed Ten Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>The entire building was destroyed by the fire, resulting in considerable losses. Wai Wah Tailors on the ground floor suffered losses estimated at over two thousand dollars. Zhen Guang Jewelry Store suffered losses estimated at six thousand dollars. It is said that both Wai Wah and Zhen Guang had purchased insurance from a certain insurance company, but the amount is unknown. Losses on the second and third floors were estimated at around one thousand dollars each. Fortunately, Man Sun Chinese and Western Printing on the ground floor of No. 74 was not affected, suffering only water damage estimated at a few hundred dollars. The second floor also suffered slight losses, while the third floor suffered losses of around one hundred dollars due to a small part being burned. It is estimated that the total losses exceeded ten thousand dollars. The cause of the fire is subject to various speculations, with some saying it was caused by a fire left unattended in Wai Wah Tailors, while others said it was caused by embers blown into the shop from the Lian Kee porridge stall at the street corner. The exact cause is unknown. When questioned, people in the shop all said that they saw the fire raging as soon as they got up. Police detectives are investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
<p>Firefighter Imprisoned for Theft</p>
<p>Also, during the fire, while firefighters were using a hose from the second floor of No. 47 opposite, British police officer Taylor was standing guard on the second-floor staircase. He then saw firefighter Hu Shi walk out of the middle room and down the stairs. Suspecting him, Taylor followed him and saw Hu take something out of his pocket on Lyndhurst Terrace and hand it to a waterworks department hose worker, Li Fu. Taylor immediately apprehended both men and discovered that the object was a woman's bracelet. He took both men to the police station and handed them over to the Central Magistracy for trial yesterday morning. Hu was charged with stealing a bracelet belonging to Luo Xin-zhen, while Li was charged with receiving stolen goods. The judge sentenced Hu to three months in prison for abusing trust and intending to commit misconduct. The second defendant, who had served the government for 23 years and did not have adequate time to consider, was released on bail of one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Po Leung Kuk Reaches Record Number of Residents</p>
<p>Sheltering Women and Children Exceeding Two Hundred The Po Leung Kuk in Hong Kong was established to shelter poor and helpless women and children. In the past, the number of women and children sheltered in the Kuk never exceeded twenty or thirty. However, since October of last year, the number of women and children admitted to the Kuk has been increasing daily, recently reaching over two hundred, more than ten times the previous number, setting an unprecedented record. Yesterday, a reporter spoke with Mr. Chan Po-yin, the first director of the Kuk, who said that eight years ago, when they built the new Po Leung Kuk on Caroline Hill Road, the number of women and children sheltered in the Kuk on Po Yan Street was only thirty. They only equipped it with one hundred beds. He learned that by early spring of this year, the number of admissions had exceeded one hundred, so they added 58 beds in the spare rooms to increase capacity. However, recently, the number of people arriving at the Kuk has reached over two hundred, and the original 158 beds are no longer sufficient. At the same time, there is also a shortage of funds. He reported the situation to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, who requested assistance from the highest authorities, and it was approved that the Po Leung Kuk's expenses would be increased by 17,000 dollars this year.</p>
<p>Youth Drama Association Formally Established Yesterday; Performance of National Defense Drama</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, jointly organized by youth drama groups from Hong Kong and Kowloon, held its inauguration ceremony at the Wah Nam Middle School last night, after months of preparation. More than ten drama groups participated. In addition to inviting veteran figures in the drama industry, such as Ou-yang Yu-qian, Cai Chu-sheng, Hu Chun-bing, and Situ Hui-min, to provide guidance, they also performed national defense plays "A Corner of North China" and "Survival in Death," with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Governor's New Year Message</p>
<p>The Governor of Hong Kong recently released a New Year message, saying: "I sincerely believe that 1939 is the beginning of a new outlook for the world. Recently, the forces of humanity and kindness have gained repeated advantages to oppose inhuman violence. On this auspicious occasion of New Year's Day, we can use 'Open Hearts' as our slogan." January 1, 1939, Geoffrey Northcote, Governor's House.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Football Results; Today, South China A vs. Eastern</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, South China A played against Kowloon Club in a special Silver Shield football match at the Kowloon Association Ground. Because the field was narrow, South China A's short passing skills were difficult to execute and were often broken by the Kowloon Club's defenders with their dense defense. Although South China A often created opportunities, they always missed the final shot. After 70 minutes of fierce play, neither side scored. The game went into overtime, but there was still no record, ending in a 0-0 draw. A replay will be held on another day to determine the winner. Also, South China B was eliminated 3-0 by Western District Engineering, which was also an unexpected result.</p>

<h3>Meeting with Mr. Tao Xingzhi; Extensive Discussions on Various Educational Issues During Wartime</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qizhuo</p>
<p>Special Report from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Mentioning the name "Tao Xingzhi" easily brings to mind his special style of "profound yet accessible, both solemn and humorous."</p>
<p>The reporter learned that Mr. Tao had come to Hong Kong from Guilin, so he visited the Kowloon Children's College the day before yesterday afternoon. After a lively conversation with Mr. Fang Yu-yan, Mr. Tao entered the reception room with his briefcase in hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao is somewhat stout and has a plump face, but he doesn't look like a wealthy old man. His hair is cut short and flat, like a student in training. He wears an old-fashioned Chinese gown over his Zhongshan suit, covered with the marks of travel. He is full of energy and amiable, a typical approachable and relaxed educator.</p>
<p>After a brief greeting, Mr. Tao kindly answered the reporter's questions with a smile.</p>
<p>"The Life Education Society has a history of more than ten years and has done a lot of work. It was only officially registered and re-launched in Guilin on the 15th of this month."</p>
<p>Hearing "only officially registered" is so inspiring! The "War of Resistance" is truly worthy of praise. It has cleared away all the shadows of past "misunderstandings" and "misconceptions."</p>
<p>Mr. Tao continued:</p>
<p>"The Life Education Society has been involved in several movements. Initially, targeting the backwardness of the vast countryside, we launched the Rural Education Movement. In the cities, to correct the privatization and monopoly of education, we launched the Universal Education Movement. When the × invaders encroached step by step and Chinese traitors were rampant in North China, facing national crisis, we coordinated National Salvation Education with the needs of the time. When the War of Resistance began, everything had to be subordinate to the War of Resistance. National Salvation Education evolved into War of Resistance Education. The current stage of the War of Resistance is a comprehensive war, so we must now launch comprehensive education to meet the needs of the comprehensive War of Resistance. The main task of comprehensive education is to extend education to our front lines and behind the × invaders, not only to the youth and able-bodied men, but also to children and old women! ... Although the forms of these movements are different, their core is only one, which is the Universal Education Movement. However, it has developed with the development of the objective situation..."</p>
<p>In a very brief conversation, he painted a clear historical progression of China's new education history. Mr. Tao's spirit of advancing with the times is manifested from this.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of Life Education? Mr. Tao succinctly said:</p>
<p>1. To raise the standard of living</p>
<p>2. To inspire alertness</p>
<p>3. To cultivate creativity</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly China's most urgent task today. Mr. Tao then spoke about the mountain cave schools recently developed in Guangxi. According to Mr. Tao, during air raids, almost half of the people in Guilin were in mountain caves. It is a pity to spend several hours or even a whole day in the caves to avoid airplanes without doing anything. The possibility of cave education is because, first, caves are natural and safe classrooms, requiring no construction costs. Second, people automatically come forward, so there is no need to worry about students. Third, there are all kinds of people among the refugees, so there is no need to worry about a lack of knowledge to serve as teachers in the caves. The content of the cave school curriculum is the knowledge of resistance and various skills of resistance that should be learned by people of all ages and genders. Now, the Guangxi Provincial Government is actively training instructors for cave schools. Cave schools are also part of Life Education. For example, when an old woman has a load on her shoulders and has to pull a child with both hands, young people should help carry the child and help carry things, so that the old and young can take shelter properly. This kind of "service" is the spirit of Life Education. In other words, Life Education should "follow the people." Follow them into the caves, follow them into the forests, follow them to...wherever they go. All the principles and methods are derived from the five words "follow the people." However, it is not just following the people in their escape, but to organize a coherent system from the chaotic escape crowd, to concentrate the scattered forces, and to turn the refugees into soldiers.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao also told the reporter a new good news, which is that the Xiaozhuang Research Institute will be established in Guilin to conduct educational research in various places. All educational issues that arise during wartime, such as military education issues, youth education issues, wounded soldier education issues, refugee education issues, etc., are all urgent educational issues that need to be researched, and it is necessary to provide implementation plans for the government and all parties to refer to and implement. Mr. Tao's task on this trip to Hong Kong is to prepare everything.</p>
<p>This is indeed welcome and comforting news. The rebirth of Xiaozhuang symbolizes the dawn of education and the revival of the nation.</p>
<p>Hundreds of knowledge-seeking young people were already waiting for Mr. Tao's lecture in the auditorium outside. The reporter did not dare to delay Mr. Tao's valuable time any longer. Finally, he asked Mr. Tao if he had written any new poems recently. Mr. Tao happily agreed to the reporter's request and immediately took out his pen to write two poems for the reporter:</p>
<p>The first sound I heard upon arriving in Hong Kong, from the mouths of children, was "Shen Bao is good":</p>
<p>Two coppers for a mother and child, indeed rejuvenating</p>
<p>Every New Year I think of old friends, regretting that the talented died too early,</p>
<p>I long to let you know that the Eastern devils should be scared in the world</p>
<p>New Year's Remembrance</p>
<p>Shi Gong measures talent and wishes Shen Bao unlimited future</p>

<p>Civil and military are assimilated without being either civil or military,</p>
<p>Civilians no longer scold each other,</p>
<p>Soldiers no longer fight,</p>
<p>Unite,</p>
<p>To create a new world.</p>
<h3>Chinese Art Progressive Association Sends Off the Old and Welcomes the New at a Social Gathering; Unanimously Condemns Wang Jingwei, Who Surrendered to the × Invaders</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Special</p>
<p>The brightly lit white electric lights shrouded the long, rectangular restaurant. Sixty-odd art lovers and enthusiasts of national salvation work held a social gathering on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>The lively laughter transformed into a solemn atmosphere. First, Mr. Qu Eding delivered an opening speech, explaining that the dinner was both a year-end social gathering, a review of work, and an opportunity to solicit members' opinions and develop work for the new year. Next, the chairman of the association, Mr. Du Rizhang, gave a speech. Although he was an elder in a long gown and mandarin jacket, he shouted "Resistance to the end" targeted at the current situation. The young friends responded with a warm round of applause.</p>
<p>Following this, the advisors of the association, introduced by the chairman, stood up one after another to express their views:</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Simu said, "The current situation has created waves, and Hong Kong is the center of the waves. Pro-peace advocates and Japanese agents have come to Hong Kong. We must unite, guide the masses to recognize the situation, and smash the conspiracies of the pro-peace faction and the aggressors." This was a very pertinent appeal at this moment. Mr. Jin Ji-hua analyzed the heroic war efforts of the past year, from tragedy to dawn, from shaking to stability. Wang Jingwei's surrender and betrayal was the most tense political crisis of the year. However, the current difficult situation will certainly be overcome and eliminated by the joint efforts of the entire nation, just as before. The New Year means that we must work hard to overcome this final difficulty. At this moment, we are infinitely excited.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Chusheng spoke more vividly and interestingly. He said that the world is like a stage, and there are always two aspects to the drama on the stage: the protagonist and the antagonist. Japanese aggression is certainly the antagonist, and China's war for freedom and independence is certainly the protagonist. The antagonist in a play must fail, and the end of Japan is naturally also a matter in the drama.</p>
<p>As for the domestic political stage, the protagonist and the antagonist are not so easy to distinguish. Therefore, the lead actor on the stage is rehearsing very hard, and we, the audience, are also confused. What a few gentlemen said about "waves" and "tense political crises"...actually, this is the best situation. There is no doubt that the antagonist on the domestic political stage will also fail. The pro-peace, compromise antagonist leader is blinded and cannot see the nation and justice. Now, we, the descendants of the Chinese nation, the righteous elements, whether we are the lead actor, supporting actor, minor character, or even backstage workers, must work together to wipe out the role of the antagonist. As for the audience in the audience, they must also cheer loudly. The exposure of Wang Jingwei's true face as an antagonist is absolutely beneficial to the War of Resistance and to China.</p>
<p>These words were very appropriate and fitting when said by the playwright Mr. Cai, and they were also witty and amusing when said at this gathering of artists. A burst of applause and knowing smiles followed.</p>
<p>Mr. Situ Huimin also said: Division, disintegration, and crises occurring at this time are even more cause to congratulate the New Year, because without this, there would be no process of elimination, and politics would not be clarified.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jiyuan and Mr. Lin Huanping also spoke, denouncing Wang Jingwei's betrayal of history and his reckless declaration of compromise without any mercy. If Mr. Wang were present, it is unknown how he would explain himself.</p>
<p>The advisors' speeches had already taken up a lot of time, so everyone relaxed the atmosphere of the gathering and enjoyed their meal, while members freely expressed their opinions and gave cordial encouragement, making people more alert and motivated.</p>
<p>The social gathering came to a close, and the arduous old year quietly passed. With lessons learned and mutual encouragement, everyone excitedly began to develop new work. The victorious and bright New Year has also come to the world.</p>

<h3>New Year's Reflections</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Yuqian</p>
<p>Last year I spent New Year's in Shanghai, and this year I'm spending it in Hong Kong. I've been running around since I was a child, and I've long been a person of the east, west, north, and south. It's all the same to me wherever I spend New Year's. Moreover, in recent years, I've never taken New Year's or birthdays to heart. If people didn't mention them, I would definitely forget.</p>
<p>The joy of New Year's exists only in childhood memories, as if it were yesterday. Since leaving home in my teens, I can say that I haven't had a stable New Year's. I even feel that New Year's is troublesome when I'm feeling bored. But one year always brings about a settlement, closing the old books and starting new ones. Businessmen hope that their businesses will be more prosperous, and artists also hope to contribute more. New Year's is not without meaning. However, there are many people who simply copy old articles and don't feel that New Year's is new.</p>
<p>With each passing New Year, humanity becomes more advanced, but for individuals, as the number of New Years passes, the beauty of youth begins to fade, and the artist's thoughts begin to solidify. This is a kind of sadness, but there are also people who maintain their youth forever and advance with the times, as long as they are not content to stagnate at one stage.</p>
<p>Ambitionists often try to hinder the progress of the times for their own selfish interests, and they do not hesitate to use cruel means to carry out their views. They even want to return the lives of all mankind to before the fifteenth century, to turn most people into ignorant and unknowing people, so that a few people can rule them. Revolution and war are conceived and nurtured here, so fascism is war.</p>
<p>Thousands of years of policies of keeping the people ignorant have created the Ah Q character of the Chinese people and have also fostered the habit of corruption. Those who offer advice are ridiculed; the eight-legged essay and test post poem are also methods of repression. The attitude of "if you're not crazy or deaf, you can't be a father-in-law" is used to play the role of a corrupt official's family slave. This leads to a philosophy of life of being content with one's lot and not interfering in things, and in short, an idea of each person sweeping the snow from their own doorstep, which has caused the nation to become a heap of loose sand, thereby inviting the idea of invasion from powerful neighbors. So this time's tragedy was already lurking before the abolition of the stereotyped essay! However, even recently, I personally heard a certain important person say to me, "...now it is important to focus on training the masses, and not to talk about organizing the masses. If you organize the masses but cannot lead them, then having an organization is worse than not having one." Perhaps he thought that it would be difficult to use his personal intentions to rule if the masses were organized? The fall of some famous cities was not without this reason. However, the Chinese people are gradually awakening.</p>
<p>This year's New Year is a New Year of great turning point. Everyone recognizes that China's anti-aggression war is a long-term war, and at the same time, the world's anti-fascist war has also brewed to a considerable temperature. The garbage and filth accumulated by history will be given a general cleaning. "Oh, great era!" Can we just sigh and be done with it?</p>
<p>I serve in the drama industry, so naturally I can't help but have plans for the drama industry. What plans? In short, the oppressor will only oppress as much as possible, and the oppressed will only resist desperately. There is no possibility of compromise between them. We only need to ask ourselves if we are prepared and if we are standing firmly in our positions. We don't need to ask whether the bombs will fall on us. A month ago, I was still wondering if professional theater groups could survive if the scope of the war were to expand. Now I no longer think about this issue. When the giant wheels of the times roll over, some cells will become particularly healthy due to the effects of metabolism, while others will die or be injured. It is like treating a disease with surgery. There will inevitably be skin breaking and bleeding. To remove rotten flesh, some good flesh will inevitably be injured. However, the disease cannot be cured without doing so. China is undergoing major surgery, and the world is also going to have a tumor treated because it has a fascist disease. We are all small cells, and when we encounter a time to sacrifice, we will not begrudge anything. Moreover, the drama movement is precisely a movement to eliminate corruption and create new life. I wish you a happy New Year!</p>
<h3>New Year's Musings</h3>
<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>Rambling about the Great Gambling of Japan</p>
<p>With the arrival of the New Year, many people seem to think of gambling. The New Year seems to be a season for gambling. Even the police officers who usually rely on catching gamblers to earn "extra income" will pretend not to see when someone opens their doors and vigorously shuffles tiles. Sometimes, they even "personally go to the front lines."</p>
<p>Speaking of gambling, we can't help but think of the gambling habits of the Japanese. There is ample evidence of the Japanese national character's fondness for gambling. Ms. E. M. Gull, the author of "Japan's Foothold in the Mud," recently published another book titled "Japan Gambling in China." Indeed, Japan is now betting its entire national fortune.</p>
<p>Those who go to Japan can see the proliferation of "mahjong parlors" on the streets. Openly indulging in gambling, ostensibly for leisure, is not considered gambling, but the hidden imports and exports are significant. The so-called "Western culture" of "poker" is particularly popular in Japan and has many variations, becoming "Western gambling." A few times, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department launched "financial prisons," and many students were detained and fined, especially famous swimmers from Rikkyo University, mostly because "their awareness of emergency situations was insufficient." It's not to say that they are inherently like this.</p>
<p>Friends in Shanghai who frequent North Sichuan Road will have seen large groups of Japanese people hiring cars from various car rental companies around 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. All the cars are rented out, and they urge the drivers to drive as fast as possible. I asked the car rental company's staff, and they said that they all drive to the dog racing and jai alai courts. Some car rental companies can cover their expenses just by doing this business.</p>
<p>We also know that in places like Tianjin and Shanghai, gambling has always been rampant. Most of the behind-the-scenes bosses of the casinos are Japanese ronin, and this is even more true now. It's not just these; even smuggling, drug trafficking, and counterfeiting are all forms of disguised gambling. Before they used force for protection, Japanese ronin were already engaged in these activities, hoping to get rich quickly. However, when they are caught and confiscated, it is like a desperate gamble.</p>
<p>Now, Japan is putting the entire country into the gambling circle. Gamblers often squander their family property, even selling their wives' bracelets, rings, and children's savings, even winter clothing. Japan's current situation is already similar to this. The gambling stakes—two million young men who can be mobilized to the front lines—have already lost at least one-third, and the wealth lost is worth hundreds of millions, with cash running out soon. What has been gained? A lottery ticket that is always worthless and never wins!</p>
<p>The Japanese people already know that such a big gamble is not a joke. They have been forcibly dragged into this big gambling game by the warlords. Mr. Aoki lost his life, Mr. Tanaka lost a son, Mr. Yamakawa lost a leg, and children are lost one after another… One day, they will lose the entire country. Gamblers often coax and coerce their fathers and wives for gambling money, eventually leading to family ruin. Even when the day of jumping into the sea is near, they are still unwilling to give up. However, the purses of fathers and wives also have limits, and one day they will show the unfilial gambler their "true colors." Wait and see, wait for the gambler's doomsday. Talking about gambling in the New Year, perhaps 1939 will be the year the Japanese gambler "jumps into the sea."</p>
<h3>Ode to Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>New Year's Message</p>
<p>Happy New Year! Happy New Year!</p>
<p>New Year's Day is a good day. Whether we are indoors or walking on the street, we all put on a smiling face. If you want to laugh, you can laugh. When you meet relatives and friends, you have to bow and salute. If you want to say some auspicious words, this year doesn't forbid saying auspicious words. "Longevity" and "Congratulations on having a baby" are still useful. It's best to add "Serve the country" and "Victory, victory!" In short, it means being happy and not forgetting national affairs.</p>
<p>New Year's Day is a good day. Generally, people are used to pasting a "welcoming spring" character on this day of the lunar calendar. Red paper with black characters, writing "A Harmony of Unity." Please change this "welcoming spring" character to be pasted today. Although the season is not spring, it is the height of winter, but what does "welcoming spring" and "welcoming winter" have to do with it? The important thing is to take the meaning of the words, "A Harmony of Unity"! Yes, family members, fathers and sons, from today on, do not quarrel. For those outside the family, even if they were once mortal enemies, old foes, they should make peace, respect each other. This year requires 450 million people to be of one heart and one mind, without a trace of grudges.</p>
<p>New Year's Day is a good day. All the officials, big and small, throughout the country must give Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang their utmost respect, a deep bow of more than fifty degrees, and then give each other one as well, as if at some kind of meeting, colleagues and comrades, without any separation, hug tightly and give each other a kiss. It must also be taken as normal, and not be alarmed. This year requires everyone to hold hands tightly, forming a perfect circle. No one is allowed to leave the circle. This game is only allowed to rest for a while, but not allowed to secretly walk away dejectedly. Anyone who steals away, everyone will not consider them a good fellow, and ask them to get lost far away. Because at this time, what is there that cannot be discussed? Your walking away is not taking your stubbornness.</p>
<p>New Year's Day is a good day. Leaders of all parties and factions across the country, let's have a happy gathering too! You have either made peace or made new friends in the past year and a half. Although everyone has their own articles, they are not completely unrelated. Under the great pen of that old gentleman of the era, they are all densely circled and dotted, applauding and cheering. He once shook his head and recited it loudly, and it has already received the praise and admiration of 450 million people. So, taking advantage of this good day, shouldn't you gather together and clink glasses? Or, because the road is far away, even if there are planes, there is no time to come, you should also write a New Year's card and send it to each other. On it, write: "Sincere unity, build a new China!" As for what public letter that long masterpiece, that is not needed!</p>
<p>New Year's Day is a good day. We go out early in the morning, facing the direction of great fortune, welcoming external happiness. As long as people are happy with me, I will consider them good friends. Taking advantage of such a day, give a deep bow. Although we are not newly acquainted, there is no need to be polite. But in this year, it is not a time of day in the middle of the sky. There are some shadows on all sides. If everyone is a friend, then we should walk together in several columns. Today, we hope to have a large gathering. There must be five roles in the meeting: one is a burly man wearing a red hat, one is a young girl wearing a three-colored scarf, one is a high-class gentleman wearing a dress with the British flag, one is a famous guest full of gold coins, and the last one, ashamed, ashamed, is our old fellow. In addition to these five key roles, there are countless children of God. Everyone faces the cross and offers a prayer for peace. Then, everyone takes out their box cannons and fires three shots at the shadows, as a salute to welcome the new year.</p>
<p>My ode is finished. I am happy for my ode.</p>
<h3>How the Japanese People Spend the New Year</h3>
<p>— Fei Dan</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords have always told the Japanese people that China has vast land and abundant resources. As long as China is annexed, they can live a comfortable life! At the same time, they also told the Japanese people that the Chinese nation is aging and declining, and has been a subjugated people many times in history. Annexation is extremely easy. Needless to say, everyone knows that this war is their greatest effort to pursue an easily obtained comfortable life. Now, the war has been going on for a year and a half, but what the Japanese people have gained is only double the Vienna rent, a public debt burden of nearly a million, and a general mobilization law that swallows the entire people's economic and political freedom. In addition, there is a pitch-black future.</p>
<p>Now it is the second New Year after the outbreak of the war!</p>
<p>Speaking of celebrating the New Year, in normal times, the Japanese people are worthy of being described as "bright and beautiful" because the Japanese usually love cleanliness. Of course, they will be doubly cleaned up for the New Year. Every house has tall pines erected in front of the door up to the second floor; bright paper pictures are hung up; women and children wear brightly colored new clothes; everyone gives each other paper gifts with packaging, but there is nothing inside; when relatives and neighbors meet, they constantly bow with unnatural laughter, saying endless New Year's greetings. In the eyes of us foreigners, it is quite bright and beautiful.</p>
<p>Today, after a year and a half of war, do the Japanese people still have such a bright and beautiful New Year?</p>
<p>The Japanese people hope that the war will end soon, but in fact, the war is becoming more protracted. Most of the healthy sons that parents have worked so hard to raise are sent to the battlefield, and only packages of "silent triumphant" ashes are returned, or "white-clad warriors" with missing limbs. Very few can return healthy. This has already cast a layer of gray over our hearts. At the same time, their daily necessities, clothing, paper, food, gifts, etc., have all been controlled by the government and cannot be discussed casually. This is to prepare for war and to help the public digest the public debt. Even if they really want to buy something, they have no money. Now, the Japanese government has the fact that pensions for retired personnel and condolence money for the war dead are given in the form of public bonds instead of currency! So recently, a Japanese newspaper published a cartoon depicting many Japanese people wearing short, tattered clothes, with sad faces.</p>
<p>Every New Year, the Japanese people, whether men, women, old, or young, must go to the "shrine," throw a copper coin into the shrine money box, clap their hands twice, and close their eyes to pray silently for a while. In the past, of course, they hoped that the New Year would be better than the old year, with family peace and health, and told their wishes to the "gods" they believed in. But this year, if they cannot but go to the shrine to throw coins, clap their hands, and pray in form, I think they must say this: "God! I curse you, you are helping the ferocious warlords, putting our sons into another world; we have lost freedom and happiness, turning the bright New Year into a dull one?"</p>
<h3>Ah Q's Victory</h3>
<p>— Si Mu</p>
<p>The New Year should be a time for auspicious words, so I will talk about Ah Q's victory.</p>
<p>The spittle from cursing people for "swimming back and forth" has not yet dried, and one's own nose is bruised, so one has slipped away to Hanoi first! This kind of "slippery-away-ism" already has quite the spirit of Ah Q.</p>
<p>It's not just that. When "noisy people" saw the mysterious news of "relapse of old illness," opinions were divided, some with veiled sarcasm, leaving some leeway, and some simply treated it as a dog drowning in water. However, "Mr. So-and-so," who is known for his literary talent and eloquence, has not yet said a word to clarify. Perhaps this is also what Lu Xun called "silence is the greatest weapon"?</p>
<p>What's even stranger is that a certain newspaper, which claims to be a faithful spokesman for "Mr.," is also keeping silent about this matter. Not long ago, it repeatedly said that "Chairman Chiang's advocacy is Mr.'s advocacy." Now, however, a Reuters news report quoting Chairman Chiang's explanation on the anniversary that "Mr.'s" departure from Chongqing was purely a personal action was boldly cut out by it! Naturally, the section about "Mr." was deleted, and even the full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions, as pointed out by the Central News Agency, cannot be found in the newspaper (at least not until today). What is the intention of this? The silence has reached the point of burying one's head in the sand, alas.</p>
<p>Perhaps the news agency was afraid of hurting the feelings of its colleagues and deliberately did not send this official news report? But it is definitely not "due to space constraints." Because on the same day, the newspaper published a letter from Zhang Junmai to Mao Zedong in large print and took the opportunity to curse the Chinese Communist Party. In this way, it spat again and achieved another victory, even if it is "Ah Q's victory."</p>
<p>However, yesterday's newspaper reported that "Mr.'s" great disciple, who had tracked him to Hong Kong, said that "Mr." was going abroad "actually on an important national mission." If the "government" is still the Chongqing government, then the speaker either did not see the excerpt of Chairman Chiang's instructions in the newspaper on the 28th because he was in a hurry, or thought that it could not be seen with this excuse. However, there was finally an "opinionated" answer. Ah Q has won again.</p>
<p>We waited for a long time, and finally saw Mr.'s speech on the 31st of last year. Strangely enough, it was like a duet with someone else, with different tunes but the same skill. This is simply not the kind of words that a Chinese person would say. Some people say that he has already put up a straw marker for sale. Other than that, we cannot find any other reason for him to make such a speech.</p>
<p>New Year's Issue of Film and Drama Magazine</p>
<h3>Memories of Darkness and Bright Prospects for Film and Drama Theory</h3>
<p>— Cai Fensheng</p>
<p>Turning the pages of Chinese film history, in these short twenty-nine years, although experiencing ups and downs, in essence, even from the slump between 1926 and 1930, there has never been such a rapid decline as in the past year and a half since the Anti-Japanese War (naturally, in terms of direction), which every sincere film and cultural worker cannot help but feel pained and indignant about!</p>
<p>Today, apart from the China Film Studio and the Central Photography Studio, which, with the support of artists, are gloriously shouldering the cinematic mission in the Anti-Japanese War, the national film revival climax triggered by the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, which followed from 1930, was completely extinguished after the fierce outbreak of self-defense in the Anti-Japanese War from "July 7th" to "August 13th"!</p>
<p>What an "abnormal" phenomenon!</p>
<p>Here, to understand why Chinese films have embarked on an "abnormal" path, we must first touch on the issue of capital: We know that film is listed as one of the major industries in the world, so the conditions for creating a film are by no means as simple as those of other artistic fields. From the beginning, making a film to its completion, it requires close cooperation with a large amount of capital at all times; however, Chinese film merchants have always maintained the operating methods of the Chinese handicraft industry, only clinging to the old ways without exploring new avenues. Their management is neither active nor their vision sharp—or if they are, they develop in an extremely bad direction, betraying the essence of film and exploiting the blood and sweat of workers to fill their own pockets. Under such management, when faced with the storms of a great era, the former naturally cannot resist and collapses immediately, while the latter, with disordered tactics, do whatever they want; it is difficult to find someone who can act as a pillar of support. This is the first reason. Secondly, we must consider the issue of talent. We know that the history of Chinese film development is relatively short, and the earliest films were still embryonic forms of civilized drama and Peking Opera—in the south, Cantonese opera. During these ten years or so, not even a sound specialized training institution for film talent had emerged. Therefore, most of the workers were "halfway converts," lacking in cultivation and skill—a widespread common ailment (I am one of the most inadequate and unskilled). Not to mention the literary foundation and understanding of the world and human life that an artist should have, even ordinary common sense sometimes becomes a major problem. Workers like this account for the largest percentage. Therefore, in times of turmoil, few are not at a loss, and some even unknowingly take the opposite path. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>Based on the above two reasons, the Chinese film industry after the Anti-Japanese War was bound to create tragic results. This is an inevitable law.</p>
<p>Facts tell us that after Shanghai fell into the so-called "isolated island" status, its role as a film and cultural center also shifted west to Wuhan—now it should be Chongqing (although Hong Kong produces many films, in terms of quality, it cannot replace Shanghai as the center because it is not related to culture—especially Anti-Japanese War culture). With knowledgeable workers being absorbed there, those who remain only care about making a living. After being exploited by capitalists with "ingenious theories," they diligently engage in making spiritually numbing and harmful monster, horror, erotic, and sensual productions to divert the public's attention from resisting Japan. Given the universality and depth of film's influence, its impact on the prospects of the Anti-Japanese War and the weakening of the government's ability to undertake this arduous long-term resistance is immeasurable!</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding Hong Kong, the production environment has never been affected. Therefore, in the early stages, a few national defense films were produced—although not entirely sound, they are now considered precious. However, due to the inevitable shortcomings of both capital and talent, the entire film market was quickly controlled by so-called "folk tales" unearthed from decadent wooden fish books and fishermen's songs. On the other hand, they desperately engage in the production of obscene and erotic films. Following this, so-called monster and horror films followed one after another, and the atmosphere of miasma was even worse than in Shanghai. Given the large number of Cantonese films produced and the wide range of their sales, the adverse effects are even more unimaginable!</p>
<p>In summary, the privately-owned film industry, which accounts for more than 80% of the entire Chinese film industry, has declined so much—most of them can even be said to be "used by capital." Then, can the output of the China Film Studio and the Central Photography Studio, which accounts for less than 20%, support the great national self-defense war by publicizing the significance of the Anti-Japanese War and encouraging the emotions of resistance to the vast domestic and foreign audiences? We must painfully point out that this is not enough, not nearly enough! We must painfully point out that the propaganda effect of these few productions is not enough to "counteract" those poisonous films!</p>
<p>When the crisis of survival of a nation has reached its extreme, and its people—especially those who hold intellectual positions and are responsible for guiding and educating the public, the film workers, not only do not provide assistance but instead—it can be said that most of them are destroying it as if they fear they won't succeed quickly enough—is this something that normal human feelings can fathom? Here, we want to cry injustice for the millions of brave soldiers on the front lines who are enduring hunger and cold while fighting bloody battles—we want to cry injustice for the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their precious lives to defend the motherland—we want to cry injustice for the tens of millions of compatriots who are struggling in piles of corpses and seas of blood because of the bombing and destruction by the invaders!</p>
<p>We have endless tears to shed and tongues that cannot be severed. We have no personal grievances, nor do we talk about private interests. We only point out all the mistakes with blood sincerity, hoping that every Chinese child who does not want to be a slave will awaken, awaken, and awaken again!</p>
<p>In fact, if the film workers themselves are not awake, we should honestly and bluntly say: the masses have long been awake. We have not encountered any ordinary audience who does not vehemently scold these poisonous films and constantly looks forward to the emergence of national defense films or meaningful films—and the news from the vast overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia shows that there is no place that does not express deep resentment towards these poisonous films—as evidenced by the fact that the masses have destroyed theaters showing poisonous films on more than one occasion, and theater staff have even gone on strike to oppose the showing of poisonous films. Other textual expressions are countless. These should be facts that are heard by the ears and seen by the eyes!</p>
<p>Here, we should deeply believe that if national defense films (if the correct writing has problems, you can use oblique writing. We want to revive the form of national defense films) were to appear, they would definitely be warmly welcomed by the broad audience. In other words, they would be able to "gain both fame and fortune" and "make big money"—because the people's prayer for the liberation of the Republic of China is so eager—they need to use this to obtain comfort, stimulation, and encouragement for their passion to resist Japan!</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang publicly stated: Today, after a year and a half of the Anti-Japanese War, we not only have solutions for military affairs and diplomacy, but also for the economy. Our strength is thirty times stronger than before the Anti-Japanese War. There is no doubt that the final victory will belong to us! But in the second phase of the war, as we get closer to victory, the hardships we face will be even greater. Our film workers should firmly believe that "the Anti-Japanese War will definitely be won, and the nation will definitely be built," and live up to the commander-in-chief's expectations that every citizen must "do their best" and "make the most of everything." Stop hesitating and decisively cast aside the meaningless concepts that are criticized by millions of people, face forward, and catch up!</p>
<p>The year 1938 has passed before today. Let all the decadent, obscene, anti-war, and even destructive things pass with the old days! We want to create our new life! We want to stand firmly on the front line of the nation and bear the responsibilities that every Chinese film worker should bear!</p>
<p>The year 1939 begins after today. The sun shines before our eyes, and the light beckons us!</p>
<p>I only call to the north and south with great enthusiasm:</p>
<p>Long live the awakened film artists!</p>
<p>Long live the liberation of the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Editor's Note</p>
<p>For this special New Year's issue, we originally intended to dedicate a large space to conduct a more detailed examination of the film and theater circles over the past year. We are extremely grateful to all the gentlemen who took time out of their busy schedules to write articles for our publication. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, many great works could not be published. Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's great work has been moved to "Free Talk," and Mr. Fan Jia's "The Activity of Hong Kong's Dramatic Movement in the Past Year," Mr. Zhu Baishui's "New Plans for Hong Kong's Performing Arts in 1938," and other articles had to be left for the next issue. For this, we feel very sorry for the authors and readers. I hereby record these few words to express my apologies and hope that the authors and readers will deeply forgive us! . Editor.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Film Industry in the Past Year</p>
<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>Last year, after New Year's Day, our sacred national self-defense war entered a new stage. The determination to resist Japan to the end and the firm belief in the final victory gave us unlimited excitement; similarly, at almost the same time, Cantonese films in Hong Kong entered a new chapter. However, this turning point in Cantonese films not only failed to excite us but also made us feel extremely disappointed! Because the direction of this transformation did not match the current political situation. In the past year, most of the film producers not only failed to fulfill the tasks that they should have undertaken during the Anti-Japanese War but instead took the opposite path. In the past year, most of the films produced were so-called "folk tales," which were once appreciated by the invaders as "the most suitable for the Kingly Way"!</p>
<p>In the past year, about eighty Cantonese films were produced in Hong Kong; more than sixty have been released. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Nanyang Tianyi Company:——</p>
<p>Joyful Reunion, General Long Bofei, Clouds Over the Pacific, Separated Family, Pulled Rickshaw Humiliated, Woman's Sutra, Broken Lingzhi, Film World Romance, Zixia Cup, Female Warrior, Sanniang Draws Water, June Frost, Suffering Ends, Filial Piety to the Mother-in-Law by Abandoning the Son, Pipa Song, Overwhelming, Enchanting Sister, Liu Manling</p>
<p>Daguan Company:——</p>
<p>Universal Celebration, Commanding the Twelve Hairpins of the Golden House, Tears of Compassion, Hundred Thousand Lovers, New Citizen, Melee, Four Sons Join the Army, Shanghai Frontline, Wandering Father, Seven Fresh Roses, Stage Romance, Orphan's Journey</p>
<p>Nanyue Company:——</p>
<p>Seeing the Light of Day Again, Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon, Playboy Tycoon, Compatriot Brothers, General Peach Blossom, Extraordinary Woman, Rouge Tears, Magistrate Mei</p>
<p>Shanyue Company:——</p>
<p>Golden Chrysanthemum, Public Enemy, Yan Ruisheng, Firewood, Rice, Oil, Salt, Sauce, Vinegar, and Tea</p>
<p>Zhongnan Glory Company:——</p>
<p>Eight Hundred Warriors, Flowery Radish, Chen Wannian's Reincarnated Marriage, Chen Shimei Does Not Recognize His Wife, Fang Shiyu, Meng Qingjun, A Good Woman Marries Eighteen Times</p>
<p>Other Companies:——</p>
<p>Red Actors Gather to Sing, Begging for Rice to Support Mother-in-Law, Love and Tears in the War, Flower Seller, Rogue Miss, Peach-Colored Spy, Flesh and Blood Great Wall, Jian's Marriage Against Difficulty in Finding a Loving Husband, Matching the Mandarin Ducks, Truly Miserly, Money is to Blame, One Night Couple, Powdered Building</p>
<p>Filmed but Not Yet Released:——</p>
<p>Female Ghost, Night Light Cup, Mouth Flower Flower, Modern Prodigal Son (Above from Nanyang, Tianyi Company)</p>
<p>Sequel to Seven Fresh Roses, Record of the Filial Son Who Escaped Punishment, Singer Bai Mudan (Above from Daguan Company) Xiangjiang Flower Moon Night, Plum Blossoms Twice (Above from Nanyue Company) Sequel to Golden Purple Chrysanthemum (Shanyue Company)</p>
<p>Peach Blossom Woman's Door Method (Zhongnan Glory Company) Jealousy Flower Wind and Rain, Spring Love Passion Fire, Ten Thousand Acres of Walking Corpses</p>
<p>Modern Woman Seeks Husband, Guerrilla March, Zhuang Zhou's Butterfly Dream, The Last Companion (Above belong to small companies)</p>
<p>According to the investigation in the list above, the films belonging to "folk tales" account for the largest number, followed by ethical and erotic elements, and films with defensive awareness account for the fewest.</p>
<p>We do not object to using folk tales as the theme of films, because "folk tales" are the most popular and easily understood by the general public; however, the problem is that all materials used as artistic themes cannot be unconditionally taken out and must be selected. The criteria for selection. On the one hand, it is necessary to consider the needs of society, and at the same time, to calculate the inevitable social reaction and its young fruits.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, art inevitably has its utilitarian nature. In other words, the production of art inevitably has a common! Fixed purpose awareness. All artistic movements in the current stage should serve the Anti-Japanese War; this is an ironclad fact, but those folk tales that are used as film themes have no positive significance at all, and are purely a manifestation of feudal and decadent ideas. The effect they achieve is certainly not enough to move the public's enthusiasm for the motherland, but instead numbs the vast public. Therefore, such films are really undesirable.</p>
<p>However, according to the business situation in the table, almost all the films that are more popular are "folk tales," and the films that are considered to have a defensive consciousness are almost all unprofitable, which is often used as an excuse by the creators of poisonous films.</p>
<p>This is an unfortunate phenomenon that cannot be denied. Folk tales containing poison sell well, while films that are considered national defense films do not sell well. This is a fact, but it cannot be used to deny the existence of national defense films (To be continued)</p>

<h3>New Era and New Endeavors</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qun</p>
<p>After a year and a half of the Anti-Japanese War, we have entered a new year, a new year in terms of time. It only makes us feel more deeply. However, if the plan for the year lies in the spring, at the beginning of a new year, we should also spur ourselves on to make new endeavors.</p>
<p>At the turn of the old and new years, whether in terms of the war situation, domestic affairs, or diplomacy, we are in a period of transition. We should further recognize the characteristics of this transition period in order to complete our tasks.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, during this year and a half, our losses and sacrifices, our shortcomings and weaknesses, are infinite. Therefore, our heartache and our shame are infinite. However, in this year and a half, we have also made progress and achieved success. Even if we have losses and shortcomings, some of the reasons did not arise today. However, in the process of the Anti-Japanese War, whether in military affairs, domestic affairs, or diplomacy, there are obvious signs of progress. Although we will never be complacent about this progress, and although our progress is not enough to keep up with our needs, we have firm confidence in the bright future of our motherland. At first, the invaders wanted to subdue us without fighting, and later they wanted to "resolve the war quickly." They tried to destroy our battlements and extinguish our will to fight. After spending a lot of effort, they finally realized after the fall of Wuhan that they could not make us kneel; after the fall of Guangzhou, they tried to seal us off; they even tried to shake us with all kinds of conspiracies and sinister schemes, intimidating us with the most brutal methods. Then, the enemy's conspiracy completely failed. Today, it is not China but Japan that is in fear and anxiety. Today, it is not us but the enemy that is disappointed and at a loss. Although we are covered in blood, we stand firm and fight like iron men. The enemy is not only disappointed in our growing strength in battle, but also amazed at our growing courage. We are strengthening our own strength in struggle, we are fighting in bloody battles, and we are reborn in bloody battles. We have infinite sorrow, and we also have infinite grandeur. This great and solemn spirit is the life of the Chinese nation, and undoubtedly, this great and solemn spectacle relies on the efforts of the entire army and people, and even more on the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Currently, in military terms, we are in a period of transition. In the first stage of the war, in the past year and a half, the enemy occupied our transportation lines and strongholds with superior equipment. We have suffered countless losses, but we have also succeeded in consuming the enemy's strength. Our equipment, technology, morale, and military spirit have also improved through this bloody forging. In the future, the war will mainly be mobile warfare. Although the war in this period may not necessarily be as tense as in the past, the scope will definitely be expanded. The entire country will be a battlefield for the enemy to hold on to, but merely holding on is not our goal. We must accelerate the organization of our new national strength and new weapons, so that we can turn defense into offense in the second stage and repel the invaders with equal and superior fighting power. In this stalemate, we must strengthen resistance in the front while turning the enemy's rear into a battlefield. Furthermore, we must strengthen the cause of military construction and production in our rear. The greater our efforts, the shorter this stalemate will be, and the sooner we will turn defeat into victory.</p>
<p>In terms of domestic affairs, the consolidation and enrichment of national unity over the past year and a half is undoubtedly our greatest political success since the founding of the Republic of China. We must not only resist Japan to the end but also achieve complete unity. However, the biggest problem in the future is to unleash the power of unity and unleash the function of unity. How can we unleash the power and function of unity? This requires everyone to abide by the law. Everyone abiding by the law means that everyone is responsible and everyone is dedicated to public service. What was called discipline in ancient times is what is called the rule of law today. In the year and a half since then, we have not only achieved national unity, but the authority of national law has also increased. However, they have not yet implemented the spirit of abiding by the law. Dereliction of duty, corruption, extravagance, and perfunctory behavior are all caused by not abiding by the law. Key national policies such as military service have not been fully implemented, and even frugality cannot be practiced, also due to the failure to implement laws and regulations. We are already in the Anti-Japanese War and are now building the country on a large scale. In the future, we must have everyone abide by the law, establish the spirit of a modern country, and the spirit of the rule of law. Only in this way can we quickly complete the military service production plan and establish the strength of a modern country. The recent crackdown on the pleasures of civil servants can be said to be the beginning of strict law enforcement. In addition, in order to adapt to the needs of total war, the issues of politics and mass organizations in the occupied cities are of course also the goals of current efforts.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, although there have been no major changes in the international arena in the past year and a half, it is indeed a period of brewing. In this brewing period, we have had many successes. First, the recognition and sympathy of friendly countries in Europe and the United States for China has increased day by day; second, Japan has become increasingly isolated. The successive progress of the resolutions of the League of Nations on China illustrates the former, and the active expansion of the military by Britain and the United States and the gradual decline of Japan's foreign trade illustrate the latter. Because of these two reasons, the two democratic countries on both sides of the Pacific, Britain and the United States, have also achieved unprecedented rapprochement. Today, as Japan's strength is increasingly depleted and China's unity and strength are increasingly strengthened, the international situation will inevitably improve day by day. The recent establishment of British and American loans is only the beginning of friendly countries' concrete assistance to China, and assisting China may also be a prelude to sanctioning Japan. Japan's recent statement on the Nine-Power Treaty is far less blunt than originally advertised, and it has already felt the pressure of international coercion. All countries except Japan regard China as a friendly country. China has always cherished the friendship of all friendly countries in times of adversity; we believe that the more unified and stronger we are, the more we will receive deeper assistance from friendly countries, because all friendly countries will definitely increasingly recognize that assisting China is assisting themselves.</p>
<p>The war situation and the future of China are bound to be bright, but the early realization of this light depends on the joint efforts of all sectors of society. We especially must not forget that as we progress and the international situation improves, the enemy will still go crazy before its "doom" arrives. Recently, Konoe declared that he would continue his aggression. Naturally, we can know even if he does not say it. Our only answer is to continue to resist and strengthen resistance. We are optimistic about the future of the nation, but we must not slacken and solemnly strive at all times. All efforts today should be adapted to the current military needs, that is, to resist the enemy in an all-round way while quickly enriching and building our inner strength to prepare for an all-round counter-attack. We need everyone to be frugal, abide by the law, and dedicate themselves to public service, and everyone must have this great and solemn confidence, so that we can continue to celebrate the victory of the Anti-Japanese War at the same time next year.</p>
<h3>Developing the Interior</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>In the past, our important construction projects naturally tended to concentrate along the coast and railway lines. The government and investors generally had not given enough attention to the important interior regions. Since the War of Resistance, the importance of inland resources and the necessity of their utilization have been recognized by the entire nation. The calls for developing the Southwest and Northwest are now echoing throughout the country, indicating a shift in the nation's perspective. The interior, which was previously not given much attention, has now become the target of both the government and the public. This is a matter for celebration.</p>
<p>Our interior is very rich in resources. If all sectors can cooperate and work hard to develop these resources, it can truly serve as the foundation for our War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Take Sichuan Province as an example: the area between the Min River and the Tuo River is a very obvious economic zone. In this area, agricultural products are very developed, and major industries such as coal, salt, silk, paper, and sugar already have a considerable foundation. If electricity can be developed, the abundant resources in this region can be used to develop other industries as well. Another example is the Jialing River basin, centered around Chongqing, which was once the industrial and commercial center of Sichuan Province. In terms of industry, there are factories for dyeing and weaving, leather, glass and porcelain, matches, flour, and soap. In terms of mining, coal mines such as Jianghe, Tianfu, and Suichuan all have some production capacity. Exported goods such as tung oil, pigs, silk, sheepskin, medicinal materials, summer cloth, and tobacco leaves all exceed one million yuan annually. Since the War of Resistance, more than a hundred factories have moved from the coastal ports and railway lines. Therefore, this region will definitely become an industrial center in the future. Not only can light industry be developed here, but heavy industry can also establish a foundation here, because there are iron and oil reserves near Chongqing. In addition to these two regions, Sichuan also has the eastern Sichuan region centered around Wanxian. We all know that China's recent export trade is dominated by tung oil, and Sichuan's tung oil ranks first in the country in terms of both production and quality. Wanxian is the largest tung oil market in Sichuan Province. The importance of this region in international trade can be seen from this. Outside of Sichuan, there is gold in Xikang and Qinghai, mercury and coal mines in Guizhou, old tin mines in Yunnan, as well as coal, copper, lead, silver and other mines near the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway. There are also tin and other domestic products in Guangxi, cotton and coal in Shaanxi, and wool, leather, and medicinal materials in the Gansu-Qinghai area, all waiting for us to develop. Some of these resources can establish the foundation of our national defense industry, some can serve as raw materials for people's livelihood industries, and some can be transported overseas to exchange for military equipment and production tools for the War of Resistance. These are all areas that should be worked on during the process of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood the importance of developing the interior and seen clearly that there are many resources in the interior that urgently need to be developed, we can proceed to discuss the methods of developing the interior. There is a misunderstanding in society that developing the interior is solely the government's job. Of course, the government cannot shirk its responsibility for such a major event and should undertake the part that it can do. However, if it is said that the government is already promoting this work, and others can simply stand by and watch, that is the biggest misunderstanding. The government's job is to promote and lead the nation's manpower and financial resources to work hard to develop the interior under a certain policy. Under this unified management, the actual effort must rely on the courage and dedication of all sectors. In this kind of joint effort, government agencies also undertake some economic undertakings, but the intention is to create wealth for the country, not to compete with the people. Therefore, the undertakings are all within the scope of the following principles: (1) those urgently needed for national defense and should be specially managed; (2) those that need to be planned or controlled in a unified manner; (3) those that are large in scale and difficult to equip, and cannot be undertaken by ordinary financial resources; (4) those that are urgently needed for national defense and people's livelihood, and the profits and losses are not significant; (5) those that supply power or fuel for national industry. The undertakings run by the government must meet the above standards and are not monopolized. If the people are willing to invest in the undertakings run by the government, they can also negotiate ways to jointly run or link up with them. Except for special reasons, the government does not prohibit or hinder the people from running similar undertakings because it has run certain undertakings. Even if the laws stipulate that they are state-owned, the government can also entrust the people to operate them through joint ventures or leasing. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently announced fifteen articles of the "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned Mining Areas," which is to give the people the opportunity to exploit state-owned mining areas as stipulated by law. The greatest need now is production, and massive production, for the use of the front, the rear, and for export. If the scope of state-owned enterprises is now defined too broadly, and at the same time there is no power to operate the undertakings stipulated within this scope, then the domestic productive forces will be restrained and unable to exert their power. Therefore, on the one hand, we are seriously reorganizing state-owned enterprises in order to create the scale of the enterprise, and at the same time, we also attach great importance to private enterprises, believing that the foundation of the national economy must be seriously developed.</p>
<p>The government has always been sincerely supporting and assisting private enterprises. In order to increase the speed of developing the interior, it is prepared to actively proceed in the following three aspects to enable private enterprises to develop more fully: First, the contact of work. In the past, private enterprises were all acting independently, without any organization. Now the government intends to make all industries organize trade associations in accordance with the newly-established laws and regulations, and also to establish links between industries. For example, the machinery needed by the chemical industry can be handed over to the machinery industry to manufacture, and the steel needed by the machinery industry is being assisted in supplying. In this way, information is exchanged, supply and demand are met, and an organic whole is formed, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort and increase efficiency. The government should take on this work of contact organization. The second is the assistance of funds. Private enterprises often stop halfway due to lack of capital? Now, during the War of Resistance, if factories move from the coast and along the rivers to the interior, all matters such as transportation, factory construction, and material purchase require a large amount of funds. Mining factories in the rear also need to increase capital to expand production and improve equipment. The government will suddenly need to help them borrow loans from banks at low interest rates. On the one hand, the government will directly allocate funds. The total of the two has reached more than 10 million yuan in the past year, and we will continue to assist them according to the original plan. The third is the provisions for incentives. The "Special Industrial Interest Protection and Subsidy Regulations" amended in June of the 27th year stipulate six types of industries that should be subsidized and protected by the government. The scope is inevitably excessive, and the methods of incentives are limited to interest protection and subsidies, which also fail to fully incentivize matters. The recently passed "Temporary Regulations on Awards and Assistance for Industry and Mining in Extraordinary Times" have added a type to the award and punishment methods. In addition to interest protection and subsidies, there are also tax reductions, convenient transportation, and exemption from land rent. As for the industries that should be rewarded, the scope is also planned to be expanded. All (1) those that are necessary for national defense and people's livelihood and should be held urgently, (2) those that develop inland bulk production or make the quality of existing bulk production more refined, (3) those that can be exported abroad to increase foreign trade, and (4) those that use domestic raw materials to imitate foreign products to reduce trade leaks are all examples of incentives.</p>
<p>The government's overall planning and joint promotion of economic undertakings, proceeding in this way, can be called management and can also be called control. Its policy takes the interests of the entire public as the highest premise, and it will do its best to lay the foundation for recovery. Everyone should also understand that the interests of the country are also the true interests of the general public, and only by working seriously in the same direction, regardless of the government or the public, can we achieve this extremely important goal. Therefore, a special explanation is given, hoping that everyone will uphold the responsibility of everyone and complete the great mission.</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Industry on the New Year's Day of the 28th Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>— Sa Kongliao</p>
<p>Returning from Xinjiang, it happened that the Hong Kong Shen Bao was about to publish a special New Year's issue, urging me to write an article to join in the fun. This time, returning to Hong Kong, although I can say that my shoulders are relaxed and I no longer have as many responsibilities as in the past, I am still very busy because I have decided to end all matters here and return to the mainland by car. However, the Hong Kong Shen Bao asked me for an article, and I felt that I should not be lazy, because the Shen Bao is the oldest newspaper in Chinese history. As someone who has decided to dedicate my life to journalism, I should not give up any opportunity to contribute to this oldest newspaper. Furthermore, the Shanghai Shen Bao was discontinued under the same circumstances as the Shanghai Li Bao, which gave me an even stronger feeling that there was still a relationship between us of weathering the storm together. Therefore, even in my busy schedule, I still want to write a few words for it.</p>
<p>I have said before that I intend to dedicate my life to journalism, so the issue I want to discuss on New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China is still about journalism.</p>
<p>It has been a full year since I left Shanghai until now. This year is a year of great changes in all aspects of China. The Chinese journalism industry, of course, cannot be an exception. Because of the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, almost all of China's national newspapers have become local. Although the newspapers in Hong Kong and Chongqing are now in an unprecedented crowded state, due to the difficulty of transportation, each newspaper can only be sold near Hong Kong and Chongqing. Therefore, the daily spiritual food of the people of Hong Kong and Chongqing—the newspaper—is excessive in terms of quantity. However, people all over the country, especially those in areas that are nominally occupied but not actually occupied, or those near the occupied areas, are feeling a general famine of daily spiritual food. This time, on my 20,000-mile trip from Hong Kong to Xinjiang and back, what moved me the most was this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Not to mention the occupied areas, even in smaller cities in the interior, the situation of the newspaper is simply beyond imagination. What is especially pitiful is that the newspaper is extremely backward, and some places do not even have it. This most important propaganda tool is so unsound among the people, how can we talk about true national mobilization?</p>
<p>So if someone wants to ask what is the first work we should do in the 28th year of the Republic of China? Standing in my own position, I answer that the first work we should do is to make newspapers visible to the poor villages and remote areas throughout the country, whether they are occupied or not. Because only by doing this can our strength in the War of Resistance truly "only increase and not weaken."</p>
<p>In the past year, I only felt that one thing in the journalism industry was the most meaningful, and that was the recent publication of the North China edition of the Xinhua Daily in the occupied areas. I believe that we who have dedicated ourselves to journalism are far better off going to small villages and towns in poor rural areas to run mimeographed newspapers or wall newspapers, and working with our conscience to awaken the people, than to be squeezed in the two places involved and eating rice as tools for boring politicians. Meaningful.</p>
<p>So on this New Year's Day, I want to ask every colleague in the journalism industry to think about what they are doing now, living that life of night and day, and whether their work in the country today, which is on the verge of danger, will be of any benefit to the country. If, after thinking about this, you feel that you were completely wrong in the past, then I hope that everyone will change the direction of their work from today.</p>
<p>The so-called new direction of work, of course, is to go to small villages and small cities to shoulder the responsibility of reporting and propaganda. However, everyone must say that this goal cannot be reached by bare hands alone. Insufficient material conditions and the illiteracy of the people in rural areas are two major difficulties that are extremely difficult to overcome. Therefore, even if there are people who want to implement what I said, the result will only be a fantasy for a while and retreat in the face of difficulties.</p>
<p>This statement is incorrect. I have thought a lot about how to realize the work of going deep into the people to shoulder the responsibility of reporting and propaganda during the 20,000-mile journey. Up to now. My conclusion is:</p>
<p>In order to simplify the tools used, and in order for illiterate people to easily accept it, if we want to run newspapers in rural areas, we can only run newspapers in Romanized characters.</p>
<p>In terms of tools, the simplest thing is just a mimeograph machine and a radio. A better set of equipment is a radio, plus a few sets of English type and a foot-operated press. enough.</p>
<p>As for the method of illiterate people accepting it, it is to go to a place and first find some young people to teach them Romanized characters. Then publish the newspaper. Then they can quickly realize that they don't need to use much effort. After a long time, they will no longer be illiterate. Even can read the newspaper. At that time, the price does not need to change to worry about whether your work is successful. I guarantee that your newspaper will definitely have a very large development in a short period of time.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the "Mass Newspaper" sponsored by the New Writing Research Association has achieved excellent results, which is a good example for us.</p>
<p>If many of the colleagues in the journalism industry can feel that my construction is still reasonable.</p>
<p>And if everyone organizes together and sets up a "center" in a larger city, and then everyone disperses to various villages and towns, exchanging work experience through this "center," I believe that in this work, everyone will not only contribute to the country, but also gain much more useful experience than just struggling to eat in Hong Kong and Chongqing.</p>
<p>I hope that on this New Year's Day, through the first newspaper in China—Shen Bao—I can introduce my ideals to everyone, and I hope that everyone will create a new era for Chinese journalism!</p>
<h3>From Wang Zhaoming's Change of Heart to the Political Strategy, Military Strategy, and Tactics of Our Second Phase of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaoxian</p>
<p>Wang Zhaoming's absurd document of accepting the conditions for national subjugation and negotiating peace with Japan was publicly disclosed on the evening of December 30th! The reporter had heard about this set of tricks a long time ago, but I was unwilling to use the heart of a gentleman to suspect the heart of a villain, so I kept silent for the time being.</p>
<p>In Wang Zhaoming's plan: (1) secretly leave Chongqing, (2) wait until he reaches a safe zone far away, and the × Prime Minister Konoe's statement is published, (3) Zhaoming issues a declaration in response to Konoe's statement, (4)...(5)...(6).... The reporter believes that the steps (4), (5), and (6) have not yet been revealed, and the weaving is too broad, and I am afraid of being caught in the conspiracy to provoke discord, so I am unwilling to be a messenger of rumors and put it in the newspaper. Now Zhaoming has shamelessly disregarded everything and revealed his true colors. Seeing him performing scene by scene, his impact on the front line of the War of Resistance will be of concern to people at home and abroad. The reporter is responsible for answering: "No impact at all." The reason has been announced three days before the publication of Zhaoming's absurd proposal, saying: "If you bow down to the enemy," then you will lose all your personality! It is tantamount to cutting yourself off from the country, cutting yourself off from the people. Everyone will point their fingers at you. No matter what excuses or rumors you make, you cannot justify yourself. What kind of appeal can you have! This kind of argument and belief is applicable to everyone. The higher you climb, the harder you fall. If you know this, then you will know that from now on, the camp of the War of Resistance has progressed from chaos to clarity. Following this, the date of the final victory is not far away! (Published in the 221st issue of the Observatory Semi-Weekly Review) However, the reporter has a frank heart and cannot help but speak. Since Zhaoming's change of heart, it has increasingly inspired the × country's warlords to deepen their unscrupulous military ambitions. The Chinese and Japanese people must shed at least 10 million more people's blood. Not only the vast Chinese people. ×××××××××××××××××××××××· Even Japanese subjects. The tragic world of widows and orphans will not stop until the continuous war is over. ×××××××××××× Here is the process. When the × military and political powers took Guangzhou and Wuhan, and took the step of sealing off the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, Britain and the United States took active action, starting with credit bags and providing parallel assistance to China to continue the War of Resistance. Under the principle of "using resources to judge victory and defeat" in modern times, the × country's continuous bloodshed is of no value. You don't need to ask the opinion of high-ranking political strategists and strategists. Even asking the dog-headed commander can give an affirmative answer. You shouldn't fight anymore, so the reporter hinted more than half a month ago that the × country was considering "which is more beneficial to continue the war or end the war?" I dare to see its lungs and liver. × The military's distress and annoyance have never been greater than this. The shelving of the Konoe statement and the suspension of the pseudo-federal organization movement are all signs of the × country abandoning the war and seeking peace. The military headquarters also intends to withdraw troops from the country on January 16th under the conditions of not recognizing our government's declaration and return the invaded land, but because this matter is too important, even the stubborn Itagaki did not dare to take obvious actions. Only the most powerful pro-war and the most radical elements who wanted to destroy China completely, such as Tada, Vice Minister of the General Staff Headquarters, and Tojo, Vice Minister of the Army, were transferred out of the heart of the military headquarters and replaced by the moderate factions of Nakasui and Yamawaki. The two war zones of Henan and Northwest have entered a state of truce invisibly because of this. Japan's eagerness to seek peace has never been greater than it is now since the September 18th Incident. Gu, because our highest leader insisted on resisting to the end, and anyone who dared to negotiate without Japan first withdrawing its troops from the country to show sincerity would be killed without mercy, the × party was unable to find a way to enter. However, if we hold on for a period of time, × will decline again and know that it will withdraw its troops. In addition, the will of the × party's military headquarters is not uniform, and the special agents in China have been in a state of general mobilization from the beginning. Each seeks a way, and there are many people around Zhaoming who are familiar with Japan. How to thread the needle in this, I am afraid that God does not know and ghosts do not know. We dare not speculate, but we can do it so that Zhaoming quietly leaves Chongqing and arrives safely in Hanoi. At that moment, the Konoe statement was released, and after the Konoe statement was released, Zhaoming used the form of a suggested article to respond in essence with a declaration. The picture is poor and the dagger is revealed, and it is abandoned by the whole country. Moreover, the performance of the next scene and scene may not be realized as expected. From a distance, it has no impact on the overall situation of the War of Resistance or can help consolidate the anti-war camp for Gan and Qing swingers, but from a recent perspective, it is heartbreaking. The sudden turn of events in the Northwest battlefield from static to dynamic must be blamed on Zhaoming.</p>
<p>Kita, the head of the special service agency in North China, recently sent a secret telegram to the military headquarters, saying: This place is launching a major plan to cut off the international transportation line between China and the Soviet Union and to attack northern Shaanxi and expand the occupied territory of Manchuria and Mongolia. We must never show weakness and retreat halfway or make compromises to save our center. Why did Kita say this? Isn't it because of Zhaoming's actions that he has increasingly inspired the wild ambition to go all out to the end, advance into the northwest, carry out a full-scale invasion, and expand the pseudo-organization? I said: Since Zhaoming's change of heart has increasingly inspired the × country's warlords to deepen their unscrupulous military ambitions, the Chinese and Japanese people must shed at least 10 million more people's blood.</p>
<p>I once read a Song poem: "⺎ Shu was defeated by Yu Zhuxian, and abandoned Bian to leave. A scholar knocked on the horse and said: Crown Prince, don't go, Yue Shaobao is about to retreat - ⺎ Shu said: Yue Shaobao broke my 100,000 troops with five hundred riders, and the capital city has been waiting for it day and night. Servants can defend, Ya Sheng said: Since ancient times, there has never been a powerful minister inside and a great general who can make achievements outside. Yue Shaobao will not be spared, let alone succeed - 兀 Shu realized, so he stayed and did not leave."</p>
<p>When Jin complained that the war was lost and had no confidence in winning peace, if it were not for one word, 兀 Shu would have left, not only would the Song Dynasty have been completely destroyed, but the living beings would also have been spared from painting their hearts. It is said that the crime of a scholar is greater than that of Qin Xiang. Who said no!</p>
<p>Now our country is fighting for survival, for equality and freedom, for justice and humanity, which is completely different from the war for one surname and one person in the past. Hundreds of millions of soldiers and 470 million people are firmly supporting our highest leader and resisting to the end. It is by no means possible to shake it with × plans and treacherous media. After this, the internal traitors can be gradually eradicated. The health office quoted the historical example of "Since ancient times, there has never been a powerful minister inside and a great general who can make achievements outside." It is even more inappropriate to appear today. Breaking the rear anti-war camp will only be strengthened, and unity will only be consolidated. Seeing that we attach importance to the military thought of "subduing the enemy without fighting" in political strategy and military strategy, but from the beginning, we did not have the extravagant hope of obtaining a price without bloodshed. After entering the second phase of the war, the international situation improved, and international assistance was also active, which is no different from the help of the world. Attacking the rebellions of the great world belongs to the one who is slightly. The future combat areas belong to mountainous areas, where ×'s heavy weapons cannot be used, and the doctrine of firepower is even more unworkable. On the contrary, the light weapons used by our army can not only be self-made and self-sufficient. The savings of medicine are even greater than before, and there are more opportunities for close combat than in the past, with mourning soldiers fighting a long-term war of war. This is the best condition for strategy two. The central breakthrough and flanking outflanking tactics of the × army were applied to the first phase of the war zone, or there was one day of length. After entering the northwest and southwest regions, the central breakthrough was adopted, and the mountains and ridges were heavy and resented, and the river crossings were blocked. The flanking outflanking must pass through thousands of deserted lands. Not only is it difficult to carry food and ammunition, but even the people and horses feel helpless to drink water. On the contrary, the people's organization and people's armed forces in this area have achieved special results. Everyone is a soldier, and every step is a camp. If the front strikes, the back responds, and if the east gallops, the west strikes. It can be automatic and can be preemptive. This belongs to tactic three.</p>
<p>All of these key points, ask × famous strategists, can not fail to recognize the advantages of our army, and will never affect the concentration of central forces due to the changes of Zhaoming's group. The improvement of the international situation and the tenacity of mountain warfare have led to the achievement of victory and harmony. Moreover, after Zhaoming left Chongqing, there was no shock overseas for him to use the false face of destiny, and he was treated with respect, but the front and the rear, the army and the government turned to think that the discovery was early, and the clarification could be expected, so no importance was given to it. After attending the memorial week on the 27th, our highest leader flew to the northwest to deploy military affairs. Although the Yellow River is frozen, and there are thousands of miles of bad connections between Jin and Shaanxi, it is possible to cross it everywhere. However, since the river crossing is steep and impossible to climb, it is difficult to climb the sky. The riverbank is gentle and easy to enter and exit to the south of the river crossing, but I have a large army densely deployed, firing artillery across the river to prevent × from advancing, and to appease the rear forces for liaison. There are only two railways that can be used: Zhengtai and Tongdi. The Daoqing Railway, which is the intersection point of Xinxiang, ends at Qinghua Town. Beyond this, it is a highway. The transportation capacity is not superior. This is to attack northern Shaanxi based in Shanxi. and criticize its difficulty. × attacked Shaanxi, not × Dao Zhengzhou, and advanced westward along the Longhai Zheng Road, which shows that its military strength is no longer sufficient for deployment. Now, Kita even exaggeratedly cuts off the international traffic line between China and the Soviet Union and the vast occupied area of Manchuria and Mongolia, and launches a joint attack on northern Shaanxi. His lack of importance is no different from Zhaoming's change of heart. The reporter is unwilling to write about it again. Hong Kong, December 31</p>

<h3>Resistance Against Japan and the Future of Our Party</h3>
<p>— Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>This article is an important part of President Chiang's speech at the Kuomintang Provisional National Congress, which has not yet been published and is therefore specially published here.</p>
<p>This Sino-Japanese War is an unavoidable war in the process of national revolution. It is also the inevitable result of the absolute conflict between Japan's deliberate policy of destroying China and the revolutionary countermeasure of our party to save China. This revolutionary policy of our party was established by our late Premier. To explain our party's established revolutionary countermeasure, we must first understand the consistent and inherited continental policy of Japanese imperialists to invade China. Since the Meiji era, Japan has had a consistent continental invasion plan. In the past, during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, it invaded and occupied our Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. After the Russo-Japanese War, it annexed Korea and seized our Lushun and Dalian, completing the initial stage of its continental policy. It used Taiwan as a base for southward advance, from which it invaded our South China and East China, and used Korea and Lushun-Dalian as its base for northward advance, from which it attacked our Manchuria and North China. It wanted to use the posture of a venomous snake; to encircle and destroy China from both land and sea, fulfilling its ambition of dominating East Asia. We can fully understand this ambition from Tanaka's memorial on the positive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, as well as the recent Japanese invasion of North China, East China, and South China. When our Premier was alive, he had already seen through Japan's ambition and the dangerous position of China. He established a revolutionary countermeasure for our party, which was to "restore Korea and consolidate China." Because Korea was originally our vassal state, and Taiwan is our territory. Geographically speaking, they are all lifelines related to the safety and survival of China. If China wants to pursue true national defense and maintain lasting peace in East Asia, it must not allow Korea and Taiwan to be controlled by Japanese imperialism. For thousands of years, China has been the leading country in East Asia. Protecting the East Asian nations and establishing peace in East Asia is an unavoidable responsibility for China. In order to fulfill our mission of national revolution and curb the ambitions of countries that disrupt East Asia, we must target the Japanese aggressive conspiracy and take the liberation of the people of Korea and Taiwan as our duty. This is what our Premier often told our comrades during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Since Japan has established a traditional policy of invading China, and we, the Chinese people, adhering to the Premier's will and determined to save China, confront each other tit-for-tat with absolute conflict. Therefore, unless Japan abandons its ambition of invasion and withdraws its invading forces, the Sino-Japanese War is unavoidable. Moreover, from China's perspective, we can either not seek our country's independence and the survival of our nation, or, if we want to implement the Premier's Three People's Principles and fulfill our party's mission of saving the country, so that the five thousand years of long-standing glorious history and culture inherited from our ancestors can continue to flourish, and so that our vast people and resource-rich great country can be revived and strengthened, we must eliminate Japan's ambition of invasion and remove Japan's forces of aggression in order to achieve our revolutionary goals.</p>
<p>In order to implement its continental invasion policy, Japan has been trying every possible means for decades to eliminate our Kuomintang in order to achieve its goal of destroying our Chinese nation. In order to implement this aggressive policy, it has exhausted various conspiracies and poisonous schemes, which is truly painstaking and cannot be described in a few words. The first conspiracy it used was partitioning. In 1927, when our party's army was marching and fighting to Nanjing, it used the Nanjing Incident as an excuse to incite the great powers in an attempt to partition China. The idea of partitioning originally arose from the corruption of China's internal affairs, so they forced the Qing government to sign treaties and demarcate the spheres of influence of various countries. Later, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the idea of partitioning disappeared invisibly. When the Nanjing Incident occurred in 1927, Japan suddenly proposed the idea of re-partitioning. Why did it propose this? It knew that although Japan could not seize the entire interest of China at this time, it could certainly occupy more advantages through partitioning. Therefore, at that time, it tried its best to induce the great powers to jointly intervene and implement the partition of China. After this proposal was put forward, Britain remained noncommittal, waiting for Britain's attitude to determine the matter. At that time, the United States, in order to uphold its traditional policy of open door and equal opportunity, opposed Japan's proposal, and the plan to partition was not successful. This is a piece of Japanese aggression history against China eleven years ago.</p>
<p>Knowing that its plan to partition China had no possibility of realization, Japan changed its approach and wanted to monopolize it. We can fully understand this ambition of monopolizing by simply looking at the fact that since the September 18th Incident, while intensifying its aggression, it has declared that all Sino-Japanese issues refuse any third-party intervention. The most favorable method for it to implement monopoly in order to achieve the complete destruction of China is to use a gradual plan, gradually invading our territory and dividing our country. When the second phase of our revolutionary army's Northern Expedition began, it prevented the revolutionary army from advancing north of the Yellow River on the one hand, and conspired to establish a puppet government in North China on the other. The puppet organizations it has now established in North China can be said to have been planned as early as 1927 and 1928. Because it did not allow our revolutionary army to go north, it dispatched troops to Shandong in 1928 when the revolutionary army reached Jinan, using violence to obstruct it and creating the Jinan Incident. In their minds, they always believed that the Yangtze River and the south of the Yangtze River were the spheres of influence of Britain and other countries, and that the north of the Yellow River must be controlled by Japan. I remember when I went to Japan in 1927, Tanaka Giichi openly expressed to me, he said: "Why must you lead troops to the Northern Expedition? Can't you establish a government in Nanjing?"</p>
<p>This meant instructing me not to let the revolutionary army go north of the Yellow River, but only to stay in the south of the Yellow River. I replied, "The revolutionary momentum cannot be stopped, China must be unified. Within China, there must not be two governments, otherwise China will be unstable and East Asia will not be stable." But he later still sent troops to obstruct my Northern Expedition, occupied my Jinan, and used this to intimidate me, thinking that I would not dare to continue to advance. He never expected that our revolutionary army would still cross the Yellow River and push towards Beiping when the Japanese army occupied Jinan, and finally overcome Pingjin and complete the Northern Expedition. Therefore, his poisonous plan to divide North China suffered a great blow at this time. Since our revolutionary army reached Beiping, the three northeastern provinces automatically changed their flags and responded to the revolution, so that the whole country of China was unified under the National Government of our party. This matter was even more unexpected by Japan. Originally, after the Russo-Japanese War, Japan regarded China's Manchuria, especially the three northeastern provinces, as its forbidden territory, and was determined to erode it, having already shown signs of becoming the master. When the revolutionary army arrived in Pingjin, it thought that the revolutionary momentum of our party would stop here and would not be able to advance to the Northeast. At the same time, in order to take the lead in preventing this from happening, it launched the bombing incident in Huanggutun on the one hand, and sent ruffians to disrupt the government organs in Changdi on the other, in order to show intimidation. Its actual purpose was to establish another government in the three northeastern provinces, to make the Northeast break away from the National Government and become independent, and to fundamentally prevent our revolutionary forces from developing into the northeastern provinces. But unexpectedly, the authorities of the three northeastern provinces at that time automatically requested to be unified under the central government, so the work of the National Government to unify the country was able to proceed smoothly and successfully, giving his policy of gradual encroachment on China a great blow!</p>
<p>His partitioning failed, and his gradual encroachment failed, but his ambition to invade China turned more and more rapidly. After Tanaka's death, the so-called young soldiers launched their wild ambitions. After Tanaka died, the Japanese warlords became leaderless, just like wild horses without reins. At the time of the September 18th Incident, they disregarded everything, raised troops and rebelled, invaded and occupied our Northeast, causing a major incident that shocked the world, and causing a great threat to peace in East Asia and even world peace.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, for the past six or seven years, Japan's invasion of China has truly been inching forward without end. It has not only invaded and occupied our Northeast, but also disturbed our Guannei, invaded Jidong, disturbed Tianjin, seized Chaharbei in the Great Wall Campaign, and threatened our capital in the Battle of Shanghai, gradually encroaching westward, and deliberately dividing us, wanting to follow the steps of gradual encroachment to achieve the goal of completely annexing China. Under this situation, if we want to survive and save the country, we have no choice but to fight to the death with the forces of the whole nation. We must all know that if this war is unavoidable, then the earlier it starts, the smaller the disaster that China will suffer from Japanese aggression; if it starts later, the greater the disaster we will suffer. Therefore, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred last July, we recognized that peace between China and Japan was hopeless, and that our country and nation had reached the final moment of life and death. At this moment, we can only resolutely launch a comprehensive and long-term war of resistance to break the poisonous plan of gradual encroachment and division. But after we implemented the national war of resistance, Japanese militarists knew that the plan of swallowing was impossible, so they simply mobilized a large number of naval, land, and air forces to carry out armed aggression and realize their dream of swallowing China whole.</p>
<p>After launching the Lugou Bridge Incident, they gathered a large number of naval, land, and air forces to occupy Pingjin and invade Shanghai, with a mighty force, not hesitating to go to war. In fact, their intention was still consistent in using their policy since the past twenty-four years, wanting to carry out intimidation in order to achieve the goal of subduing us without a fight. They did not know that modern China is no longer the China of Yuan Shikai's era twenty years ago. They did not expect that the Premier's great beliefs had taken root in the hearts of the people, and that our party's revolutionary forces had been established throughout the country. Especially, they only saw that our national defense preparations had not been completed, and that the power of material economy had not been fully developed. Therefore, when they mobilized armed aggression, they only calculated that China's military equipment was no match for them, but they did not calculate our vast land, abundant resources, and large population, all the inexhaustible potential, into the power of war. They did not calculate the revolutionary spirit of our Premier and revolutionary martyrs sacrificing and struggling, and the spirit of the Three People's Principles, into the power of war, and thought that with their superior military and material power, they could suppress China in one fell swoop. But they did not know that this Sino-Japanese War is not a common international war, but a revolutionary war of the Chinese nation to complete the national revolution and seek freedom and equality. In this revolutionary war, material and military power are only one of the conditions related to victory or defeat, and the main condition that determines the victory or defeat of war is still spirit—that is, revolutionary doctrine. As long as our faith in the doctrine does not waver, and the power of the doctrine is not eliminated, any violence cannot destroy us. What's more, we have five thousand years of long-standing glorious history and great and noble culture, we have four hundred and fifty million compatriots, and forty million square li of land. With our revolutionary spirit, using these superior conditions, eighteen months of resistance have been enough to awaken the crazy dreams of Japanese aggression. They not only cannot achieve the goal of subduing us without a fight, but they cannot even achieve the goal of quick battles and quick decisions even if they use all their strength. I believe that after the War of Resistance, not only will Japan not dare to invade us again, but the world will also have to change the standard for estimating the power of war. At least it can make peace more respected and guaranteed.</p>
<p>Although our War of Resistance against Japan has inevitably suffered setbacks in the early stages, we have all the necessary conditions for victory and the foundation for certain victory. As long as our party comrades lead the four hundred million compatriots with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and under the leadership of one doctrine and one government, work hard, struggle, and advance unremittingly, not only will one Japan not be able to do anything to us, but even three or four times the current power of Japan will not be able to defeat us. Our War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the Chinese nation will surely be revived.</p>
<h3>Accomplishing Our Sacred Mission</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>Time flies, and now it is the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic of China! What everyone remembers, of course, is the sacred war of resistance of the past one year and six months; what everyone pursues, of course, is the bright and splendid future ahead. We cannot think that everything in the past is necessarily satisfactory, but one thing can be said: the War of Resistance is always satisfactory! The War of Resistance is for the independence of the country, the liberation of the nation, and the freedom and equality of the four hundred and fifty million descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The important value of the War of Resistance itself will of course make anyone sing its praises, and "Resistance is revolution." Our inability to doubt resistance is the same as our inability to doubt revolution, and has the same meaning.</p>
<p>However, the War of Resistance is not for the sake of resistance for resistance's sake. Resistance is only a means, not an end. Our goal is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, because a new China based on the Three Principles of the People is international equality (nationalism), political equality (democracy), political equality (democracy), and economic equality (people's livelihood). The War of Resistance is to defeat the aggressive forces of Japanese imperialism, and then seek the full realization of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. Therefore, what everyone is pursuing is the bright and splendid future of a new China where "resistance will surely be victorious and nation-building will surely be successful"!</p>
<p>How to realize this future?</p>
<p>This is the task for all of us!</p>
<p>Since the goal is hanging in front of us, and the responsibility is resting on the shoulders of each of us, everyone's efforts from now on should pay attention to the following things:</p>
<p>First, we must have a strong conviction of national self-esteem and self-confidence. We do not deny that the Chinese nation already has some weaknesses, and has exposed many vices, but the long history and culture of more than five thousand years is something that no other country can catch up with; the Chinese people's habits of loving peace, valuing trustworthiness, and enduring diligence and frugality are also superior to any other nation; the Chinese people are not more foolish than Westerners, and the Chinese people's innate intelligence and talent are indeed superior, but because the level of education is not universal, and the various aspects of politics, economy, and society have not yet reached the level of modernization, many shortcomings are still present, which is also the reason why China is being invaded and oppressed by strong forces. However, invasion and oppression can be regarded as the only opportunity to alert us, teach us, and improve us! We must never shake our strong conviction of national self-esteem and self-confidence! If our own belief in our own country and nation is fundamentally shaken, then we are only declaring spiritual bankruptcy, declaring kneeling and surrender, and simply degrading ourselves to be captives of imperialism and slaves of the Japanese! This kind of person who has lost confidence is slag that should be eliminated in terms of the nation, and is the number one fool in the world in terms of the individual.</p>
<p>Second, we must have a thorough understanding of the current military and political situation and an optimistic attitude. Why are some people pessimistic about the current situation and doubt the future of the War of Resistance? Some even hope for compromise and peace? This is undoubtedly due to their unclear estimation and unclear observation of the future of military, political, and diplomatic affairs. Of course, we do not deny that the loss of territory and troops over the past year or so is a failure rather than a victory; but we must know that it is inevitable for a weak nation with everything lagging behind to resist imperialism. If we did not have a predetermined trend of failure, the Japanese imperialists would not have come to invade us in the first place! Therefore, what we are fighting for since the start of the War of Resistance is the final victory, not the gain or loss of one place or one city, and the advantages and disadvantages of quick battles and quick decisions. How to win the final victory? Chairman Chiang has already made it clear that it is a "protracted war," it is a "total war," and it is a "proactive war"; the current moment is the start of the unfolding of the total war, the protracted war, and the proactive war. What we are fighting for is how to wear down the enemy in this current stage? How to trap and starve the enemy to death? It must be after a certain period of time before a major counterattack can determine the final victory. Therefore, in terms of the current stage of strategy, there is no need to be pessimistic at all, and at the same time, there is only optimism. Militarily, everything is entering a favorable situation; politically, in addition to working hard to produce in order to balance exchange rates, we have recently obtained the support of British and American loans; diplomatically, the situation of the national attachment is actively improving, which is even more obvious to all. Looking at the enemy: the increase in anti-war sentiment among their general public, the replenishment of their troops has encountered fundamental problems; their finances are even more exhausted and are on the verge of collapse; as for the isolation and helplessness in diplomacy, which is about to suffer a major blow, their difficulties need no further discussion. Therefore, from any aspect, we are optimistic—we do have many places where we feel stretched, but in fact, the enemy has more places where they are stretched than we do. Why do we only value the enemy and despise ourselves! All wavering ideas and pessimistic emotions, everyone should thoroughly overcome them! Thouroughly eliminate them!</p>
<p>Third, we must have a spirit of self-encouragement, gritting our teeth to endure hardship, and a spirit of struggle. As mentioned earlier: what we are striving for is the "final victory," and everyone must know that the more "final" it is, the more difficulties it will go through, and the greater the suffering it will suffer. War is originally "unavoidable." What mankind seeks is peace, not war. The reason why we are inevitably on the path of resistance is originally to seek survival for the nation and to fight for independence for the country without hesitation. Under this meaning, as long as it is beneficial to the nation and the country, as long as the sacrifices we pay are sufficient to benefit the survival of the nation and the independence of the country, we have no choice but to desperately endure any hardships and difficulties—so we hope that all compatriots and comrades throughout the country, whether in the front or in the rear, whether it is better to contribute money or effort, must grit their teeth and endure hardship to the end; at the same time, we must use the spirit of "seeking life in death" to fight selflessly. Now some people, because they are living in a corner of the southwest, because they miss their hometowns that have been lost, because they feel the pressure of life and the difficulty of the situation, have developed the idea of compromise and surrender from their usual comfortable and pampered mood. This is a most shameful phenomenon. In fact, observing the many facts at present, it seems that apart from the former soldiers, have the people in the rear suffered any hardships? We only see a distorted prosperity, we only see pointless waste. Where is the strict control of countries like those during the European war—where is the national rationing of food and clothing like during the European war—China's current situation is indeed morbid, indeed needs to be corrected with effort, but on the other hand, it shows that China's vast territory and abundant resources, its great economic elasticity, are far beyond what Japanese imperialism can reach. As long as everyone endures hardship, as long as people understand the true meaning of life, can adjust their personal standards of living and desires, and at the same time contribute their strength and wealth to the country as much as possible, then, not to mention fighting the Japanese for three or five years, but even ten or eight years, or even a hundred years of war, China has the strength to sustain it—the problem lies in whether we can endure hardship and are willing to struggle.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must use the program of resistance and nation-building as the only goal of our hard work and struggle. The long-term war of resistance is originally an extremely arduous and outstanding task, and the reason why it is arduous and outstanding is not in the war of resistance itself, but especially in the simultaneous advancement of war of resistance and nation-building. The declaration of the Provisional National Congress of our party is the clearest explanation of this point—we should do our best to strive for the survival and prosperity of the country and the nation, and at the same time, according to the Three Principles of the People, continue to complete the political and economic construction, so that China can gain freedom and equality in the world. We also know that if our country now had a peaceful environment, it would be easier to complete this construction, but the aggression of Japanese imperialism is deepening, making peace hopeless. This war of resistance is inevitable and unavoidable in terms of the situation. We cannot hope to build in the midst of peace. We must make the war of resistance and the nation-building go hand in hand. Then, the responsibility of saving the country simultaneously falls on our shoulders. As for how to resist and build the nation? The Three Principles of the People are our highest guiding principles, and the program of resisting and building the nation is the practical direction for implementing our principles. What we need to examine now is whether these programs have been implemented? Or how many percent have they been implemented? What we need to strive for is how to develop the wartime nation-building work so that after the war stops, it will become the political and economic foundation for national revival. For example, wartime state-owned trade, industrial and mining adjustments, etc., will achieve the purpose of developing state capital and controlling private capital after the war; wartime participation system, military service system, etc., will achieve the purpose of democracy, local autonomy, and free conscription after the war, etc. In short, in the process of our struggle to resist and build the nation on this side, we must not leave our program at any time, and we must strive to realize the Three Principles of the People at all times.</p>
<p>According to the above points, first, we firmly believe in the self-esteem and self-confidence of our own nation, so that we have a "foundation"—second, we thoroughly understand the situation between the enemy and ourselves, and we feel at ease and justified, so that we "do not waver"—third, we are determined to sacrifice and struggle to the end, and we will fight a protracted war with the enemy, so that the "final victory" belongs to us—fourth, we work hard according to a certain direction and goal, so that we will not "collapse" during the war, and we can "revive" after the war—in this way, it is our bright and splendid future—the masses must catch up quickly to accomplish our sacred mission!</p>
<h3>Promoting and Expanding National Consciousness</h3>
<p>— Wang Chonghui</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance began, the most prominent example of the unity and progress promoted in our country due to the aggression of powerful [Japanese] is the increase in national consciousness. Over the past year, [the Japanese] have been pushing their so-called continental policy, aiming to divide and eventually eliminate our nation by seizing our country's territory. Therefore, since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, both the government and the public in our country have deeply felt the invasion of the nation, the insecurity of our borders, and the surge of imperialism, and have been anxious about it. However, [the Japanese]' desire to implement their continental policy has led to different approaches over the decades due to different views on implementation steps among those in power. Some advocated deception, like Shidehara, while others favored forceful seizure, like Tanaka. However, despite different paths, they all lead to the same destination, ultimately being birds of a feather. It can be asserted that their ultimate goal is to annex our country, with no other intentions. Because of this, our country's efforts to improve internal affairs and strengthen national defense to resist foreign aggression have become a unified call. However, before the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident, this consciousness only reached a certain class, and the general public did not have a strong sense of it. The reason for this is that those who bear political responsibility and knowledgeable people in society or education have a clearer understanding of the situation, while the general public has not directly felt any impact. The only exception is the people in the four northeastern provinces who have already been oppressed by [the Japanese]. The people in other provinces did not feel it as deeply, and even those in the lower classes of knowledge were not moved. But now, things are very different from the past. During the eighteen months since [the Japanese] attacked our country, their atrocities and actions in every place they passed through have been countless, as seen in Chinese and foreign newspapers and detailed accounts in books. The barbaric and outrageous words of [Japanese] warlords and those in power, as well as their disregard for any country in the world, their tearing up of sacred treaties, and their actions to eliminate the rights and interests of third countries, have been seen repeatedly. As a result, not only do countries concerned with collective security have a deep understanding of the aggression of violent [Japanese] and their actions against the world, but also the general public in our country has clearly realized the urgent necessity of the whole nation uniting to resist foreign aggression and save the country. Therefore, there have been frequent reports of people in various places organizing forces to rise up and resist [the Japanese] invasion. Even in places without organization, it is common to see people using their strength to punish the enemy. Not only that, various parties, factions, groups, and aspects have shown their greatest determination and expressed their greatest support for resisting [the Japanese] and building the country under the leadership of the central government. From this perspective, the aggression of powerful [Japanese] against our country this time has not only failed to divide and annex our country but has also promoted the increase in national consciousness in our country.</p>
<p>However, we must not be satisfied with this. We have experienced that the national consciousness of our people has been significantly enhanced by the invasion of the powerful [Japanese]. Based on this increased state, we should make more efforts to further expand the methods of national understanding in order to resist [the Japanese] and complete the great mission of resisting [the Japanese] and building the country. At this critical moment of survival, the country and the people are like standing at a crossroads. One step forward means life, one step back means death. Without resistance, there can be no nation-building. Only resistance is nation-building. Without revival, there is destruction. Therefore, we must gather the strength of all parties, factions, groups, aspects, and classes of people in the country, expand national consciousness under the guidance of the highest leader, fight a life-and-death battle with [the Japanese], recover our lost territories, save our compatriots in the occupied areas, and expel [the Japanese] from our territory. Only then can we jointly witness the completion of the construction of a new China. On the occasion of the New Year, I would like to offer these words to all patriots, using them as a congratulatory message.</p>
<h3>Wishing the 28th Year of the Republic of China</h3>

<p>"Try to look at the land today, whose world is it anyway!"</p>
<p>——Written for the Hong Kong Shen Bao special issue on New Year's Day of the 28th year.</p>
<p>On the first day of the publication of Shen Bao in Hong Kong, I wrote the opening remarks, comparing the process of human evolution, from the first month of fetal life to childbirth, from crawling at one year old to adulthood, to the current state of the earth. Mankind is not yet fifteen or sixteen years old. Why? In a civilized and peaceful era, there is no military science, only other sciences. Now, try to have the League of Nations designate all countries in the world to convert their military spending into national production costs. What worries are there about insufficient education and relief funds! What worries are there about the non-emergence of a world of great harmony! What worries are there about the non-existence of a pure land of great countries! Even in the case of our aggressive neighbor, if they were to shift their military spending of one hundred and several tens of millions to domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce, how could it be that the middle class would have to worry about selling their wives and children to avoid starvation, and there would be no need to send young soldiers who were originally farmers, workers, and merchants abroad, turning them into hundreds of thousands of corpses? How could countless young women lose their husbands? How could countless boys and girls lose their parents? As for our invaded country, we are their guests, facing bankruptcy, unemployment, sacrificed lives, and the dishonor and suicide of women. I don't know how many – life is only a hundred years, this kind of double-loss calculation is hateful and laughable to think about – if the law of karma still exists, then they are reaping what they sow, isn't it that seventy million madmen are digging their own graves—</p>
<p>The greatest precept of our Confucius' teachings says: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself;" Christianity says: "Love your neighbor as yourself"; Buddhism says: "Save yourself and then save others." But now, they specialize in doing to others what they do not want done to themselves, they do not want to be robbed, but they especially love to rob, they do not want others to commit adultery, but they especially love to commit adultery with others. The Spring and Autumn period avenged nine generations of grievances. Our country's successive descendants calculate this endless blood debt, and East Asian peace is out of the question. Even Western countries have to increase their military preparations because their territories in the Far East are under pressure, making world peace forever impossible. Aren't they human traitors and monsters of the world?</p>
<p>Then are we without sin? Saying: How can we be without sin? They have been plotting against us for more than thirty years, while we have been ignorant and stupid, engaging in the activities of rats in their holes. Before the Xi'an Incident, the various ports of Ning, Han, and Guangdong were constantly changing, and history books could not record them all, as if they were children fighting each other in a closed era. Our people do not know the big picture of the world, do not know the ambitions of strong countries, and suffer the high-handed rule and exploitation of warlords (such as Sichuan's grain tax, which can be collected until the 50th or 60th year of the Republic of China), and do not know that disorder and insult are always one and the same. People insult themselves before others insult them, "A country must first attack itself before others attack it." The consequences our country suffers today are all the result of the causes we planted in the past. Lü Ziyun said, "All the things of the past are like yesterday's death, and all the things of the future are like today's birth." We should sincerely resent and blame ourselves, comparing ourselves to the barbarians. In the future, when we fight back to our homeland, we must still uphold the sacred teachings of "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself" and do not inflict atrocities of rape and murder on the innocent [Japanese] people. This is also what the law of karma should foresee, not the mockery of Duke Xiang of Song's benevolence.</p>
<p>All living things love their lives. What distinguishes humans from animals is that, while both love our lives, there is something more worthy of love than life, which is even more important than life. Mencius said: "Life is what I desire, and righteousness is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up life for righteousness." The noble integrity of Wen Tianxiang and Qu Shisi has been cultivated by this one thought. Even the common people who complete their integrity and achieve benevolence, never regretting their deaths, may not necessarily be literate, but their aroused conscience is enough to move the wind and rain and make ghosts and gods weep. Those who willingly accept the whip in order to survive are truly equal to lower animals—today, the people in the occupied areas, those who are willing to be puppets, losing their minds and going crazy, are ultimately in the minority. If they are united and redeemed with morality, the hearts of the people will yearn for Han [Chinese], and changing the flag will be a matter of moments—try to look at the land today, whose world is it anyway? I will predict it in the first year of the 28th year!</p>
