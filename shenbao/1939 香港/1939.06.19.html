<p>社評</p>
<h3>「軍人之友」運動</h3>
<p>全國基督敎靑年會軍人服務委員會，最近發起全國徵求「軍人之友」運動。此種運動，在先進文明各國，本為一種經常的組織，而對於被壓迫民族反抗侵略的軍人，尤具有特別重要的意義，因為被壓迫民族進行及抗侵略之戰鬥的軍人，無論在物質配備與精神敎育方面、　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，其有賴於各界民衆的援助，自然更為必要與急迫。我國此次抗日戰爭，是以一半封建半殖民地的國家反抗現代化的資本帝國主義國家的戰爭、我國軍人為求獲得最後勝利起見，自更有賴於民衆的同情的協助，故最高領袖旣一再以「民力重於軍力」諭示全國而各方領袖亦再三以『最後勝利，依靠民衆』以及『澈底實現軍民合作』相互勉勗，而事實上抗戰二十三月以來，無論華北華中，無論台兒莊之役以至大洪山之役、其所以獲得偉大勝利，均可看到民衆協助軍隊力量的重要。至於廣大×人後方的游擊戰爭，軍人依恃民衆的意義，其重大尤不言而喻。</p>
<p>全國基督敎靑年會軍人服務委員會，自抗戰以後，在各戰區，成立十六支部，進行慰勞救護、訓練，宣傳等工作。就過去一年以來的成績觀察，則在該會下所服務的軍士，已不下四百萬人。最近該會還擬將十六支部擴充為四十處，服務人員增加二百五十人，此次發起全國徵求「軍人之友』運動，卽在希求各界熱心人士，一致協助，以便共同努力積極推行此項工作。其宗旨是：（一）實行軍民合作：（二）增强抗戰力量；（三）克盡國民天職；（四）振起尚武精神。總之，其工作不外為對抗戰軍人盡其友道，贊助軍人服務工作，以盡精神與物質及一般經濟上的協助。熱烈參加此種運動。不僅應該是每一個國民的愛國義務，而且亦應該認定是每一個國民的欽國權利。我們不僅要以熱烈參加此種運動，來發揚我五千年遞壇的偉大的民族精神與民族美德，我們還要在全國範圍，在後方，在戰區，在×人後方，　　　　　　　，加緊與擴大對內對外的宣傳，建立成千整萬的『中國軍人之友』的組織！中國軍人今日的艱苦奮鬥，不僅為着中國的解放，並且也為着保衛世界的和平文化與正義，我們相信這種運動，是可以廣泛展開的！</p>

<p>×人困難的地方，首先感到的是：縱然把以前海、陸、外三省的駐華機關，凑在一起，但實際上它們所抱的方針和企圖，却並不能一致，其結果必將使實行政策時的勢力無形減低。其次，屬於政治經濟等部門的工作，實際上並不能和戰爭分開·內閣直屬機關的「興亞院分局」，如持有强大的權限時，當然要與現地機關發生摩擦了。</p>
<p>這是×寇內閣無法應付的問題，也是引起一般人注意的問題。但這「注意」却是過慮的，×寇軍閥「成竹在胸」，已早有了打算。</p>
<p>×寇軍閱，自從平沼繼近衛組閣以後，其勢力比以前更為强大了。為了運用新的勢力，它要在日本各派系的鬥爭中，特別抓取最大的權力。平沼內閣實際上仍在近衛內閣操縱中，平沼上台，原有之重要閣員，多未撤換，依然在軍部的把持中·所以無論「興亞院」的組織與企圖是怎樣，建設東亞新秩序的陰謀是怎樣，總是以軍閥們的目的與利益為旨歸。而在人的問題上，軍部是採用著壟斷與獨裁的手段，「聯絡部」的成立，就是這種「手段」的具體實現。</p>
<p>主要實施「興亞院」的政策的機關，是「興亞院聯絡部」。在北平，天津，上海，厚和（歸綏），厦門五地，于三月一日均舍成立。其他開封，彰德，太原，南京，漢口，亦同時設置「聯絡部出張所一·聯絡部長由隨海軍分任，現已定喜多誠一（降軍少將）駐北平為華北聯絡部長官；酒井隆（陸軍少將）駐綏遠為蒙疆聯絡部長官；戶春造駐厦門為厦門區聯絡部長官；柴田彌一郎（海軍大佐）駐靑島為靑島出張所長；太原出張所聞將由×特務機關長谷荻那華雄兼任·以上各聯絡部長官與次長，均由「興亞院」調查員充任。</p>
<p>從此我們可以看到下列各種事實：</p>
<p>一，聯絡部長官，均係軍部重要人物，「興亞院」不啻軍閥操縱下另一機關·</p>
<p>二，興亞院聯絡部縱然成立，而特務機關仍然不能將政治經濟文化各部門事務完全交出，也就是聯絡部代替不了特務機關。不但如此，各處特務機關，且有擴大其職權的陰　，這企圖已在山西實現了·</p>
<p>在山西前只有太原特務機關及運城出張所，處理政治經濟治安等關係事件，現已于二月一日，將太原特務機關昇格為「山西特務機關」，並將以前所設置之縣聯絡員，全部歸于新設置之特務機關內·現在省內各地所設置之特務機關，均已先後成文，新任各長官，皆已赴任·</p>
<p>三，在軍閥操　下的『興亞院聯絡部』與「特務機關」兩個侵略機關，同時存在。勢必加重對中國的侵略與壓</p>
<p>四，聯絡部長官，在北平綏達為陸軍部人員，在厦門上海為海軍部，益證明日×陸海軍部各有企圖。雖然它們極力避免衝突，但是它們間的矛盾，却在日益加深着·</p>
<p>綜合數點，已洞見日×軍閥之跋扈與×閣之無力·所以「興亞院」之成立，僅只是軍閥們對中國的侵略與剝削的另一工具·所謂建設東亞新秩序等飾詞，也只是烟幕而已。但是日×軍閥雖握有大權，而其內部之衝突，亦日益加深·聯絡部與特務部的職權上的圖突，也多加一個機會·同時×國內的人民，也不會受其朦蔽，反戰厭戰的情緒，日益高漲，所謂「興亞院」，也僅是白天做夢而已。（湧上）</p>

<h3>戰雲下的汕頭市</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者白羣</p>
<p>因了七八號×人企圖登陸，形勢緊張的影響，本已冷落的汕頭市更形冷落起來。許多大的公司店號完全關上門。早上惟有　雜貨攤在　　　賣，人口也疎散剩十之二三，　路上僅點綴三五行人，　得異常寂寞。記者冒着微微的細雨走在馬路上，就是聽見一輛人力車的鈴聲，似乎也感到熱　而刺耳。</p>
<p>軍警梭巡很密。軍警督察處還派了幾度人檜查由港來的旅客，防止漢奸間諜潛入活動，潮汕鐵路破壞後，汕頭的交通工具僅有船，開往各地的船為避免×機的　擊都在　晨和傍晚啓程，顧得安全，却顧不得便利，這是無可奈何的方法。</p>
<p>在火藥氣息窒　下，汕頭市內的文化事業也很受打擊，學校多數停課了，就僅有的幾份報紙，嶺東民國日報，商報星華日報，亦緊縮得可濟，每日出半張紙印刷固義，而新聞村料也頗貧乏，铺路更成問題、不過在　戰時，財力與物力雙重壓迫下，我們是不能若何加以苛求的他們能够堅持的幹，仍不失為一個靭性的士鬥。</p>
<p>×人向汕頭進犯，怕是一種侈言。×機　的頻頻出現汕海，依大體上觀察還是配合九口封鎖的裝模作樣。潮汕的民氣和力量在華司令的策動下相當的高漲。記得潮汕自衛團的創立者翁照垣將軍日　道　惠州，記者也嘗　他說過潮汕民衆武力的基礎很緊固，不因地形而鬆弛了抗戰的熱情和决心。如果×人敢冒險登陸，必能配合軍隊予以强烈的反擊，摧毀×人的。最後記者走過育善後得，一間問的日本商店，早經封鎖起來。囘憶昔日的汕頭，日本和台灣人的商務和勢力是相當强大的，現在每間店的主人不僅把血汗建成的生意拋棄，甚至還要到戰場上去送命，日本軍閥所給予他們的待遇是多麼慘酷啊！所以日本的軍閥不但是中國的×人，也是日本勞大衆和小本商人的×人！我們要鼓動他們反抗。××　政治部的日文反戰標語正興記者發生同感，起來協同打倒日本軍閥　！日本的民衆們！（十二日發於汕頭）</p>

<h3>私家偵探</h3>
<p>三百六十行之一</p>
<p>一天，紐約某公寓中，有一位婦人、經過朋友的介紹，請一位女工前來試穿胸衣、那個女工發現這婦人可以行，坐，彎身、一如常人。這位婦人會因為遭遇汽車所撞，向法院控訴車主，聲稱身體已成癱瘓、要求賠償損失。但是在那女工離開以後不久、法院宣判原告敗訴。原因是那個女工，是一價私家偵查所派來為被告律師搜集證據的密探。</p>
<p>幾年前，有個富翁請一家私家偵查所，替他追尋一個十九歲的兒子。那個偵查所發現他的兒子和一羣放蕩不親的無賴在一塊兒，並和一個女招待結不解緣、偵杳所使派一個年紀比那個少年大幾歲的人，去和他做朋友，並使他專心注意音樂、不久，這個新朋友把富翁的兒子、逐漸引入道德較高尚的益友　裏去，終於使他離開歧路，在一個樂隊裏做樂手，並和那個女招待斷絕關係、</p>
<p>私家偵探在什麽地方行使職務，這是你所料想不到的。有一次，一個地產商要買一塊地皮、但是那個地主不肯出賣、他便去請偵探在地產的隔壁開個畜豬場，不久、那個地主也就不得不歡迎地產商去購買了。</p>
<p>浪士頓有個女人懷疑丈夫有外遇，一次，她丈夫因為職務關係、到費城和華盛頓的專利局去，可是她以為她的丈夫和女書記到旅館裏去、她的丈夫囘家時，她便向之質問、噪鬧不休。雖丈夫堅決否認、但是妻子始終不肯相信。翌日，丈夫將這件事訴諸私家偵探、那個偵探便答應承辦這件事，並對他說，　在兩天之內、你再動身到費城和華盛　的專利局去，並帶尊夫人一同去。但你應穿一套白色衣袴，結條藍色領帶，並在紐扣洞，插一朶藍色花、」兩天後、當夫妻一、人在費城的車姑下車的時候，就有個　夫脫帽前來對他說：「先生、你好，你要不要在行李上加個記號，像你前天所做的一樣？」他的妻子還是有點懷疑。但是當他們到華盛頓的專利局時，門前的侍者對他說：「史密士先生，你前天才來，為甚麼今天又來呢？」他的妻子至此才曉得自己的不是、立刻請求丈夫寬宥。</p>
<p>偵探的職務，和別種業務一樣，也有專家。最下層的人員，是釘梢者。他的職務，是時時刻刻監視那個被偵查人，多半是在雨天，站在馬路的轉角處，或在被偵查人的住宅對面租一個房聞，拿一只望遠鏡，整日整夜由窗戶眺望。到了他窺察的任務完成之後便寫出一篇很詳細的報告，經過所中職員修改潤飾之後，交給當事人看。</p>
<p>和釘梢者相反的，是誘　者。他設法用種種手段，去迎合被偵查人的心意，獲得他的信任。一次，有個祖任誘騙工作的少年·和一個被偵查的老年人認識，兩人的感情不久就非常親摯，老人時常請他到家裏去玩，這樣，他就看到某種秘密的文件。</p>
<p>偵查所的女誘騙，不管是可愛的或可憎的，往往在輪給，火車，旅館，辦公室，和工廠裏活動着。</p>
<p>兼職密探，是一種釘梢兼誘騙的專家，他們的行動，遍佈美國的工業和社會組織裏。他們混在機師，辦事員，速記員和工人之中，給你分辨不出有一人，曾在一個工廠中工作二十年，沒有被他的同事懷疑過。這種人每日向他們的上司提出報告，有時在幾個月之中，所說的恐怕不過是空談而已，但是有時候報告的結果，會使那些不盡職的，不誠實的，或好鬧事的僱員失業。</p>
<p>查探昌是私人偵探的第一流人物，他們的收入最好，有一個怕查員，曾在一件離婚案中充任出租汽　車夫，把車停在被偵查人的辦公　前。那個被偵查人，很覺滿意，每日有一個又敏捷又可　知趣的東夫，把他　到情人的住宅去·所以每次都給他很可觀的小賬·</p>
<p>舊金山有個百萬富翁的妻子，懷疑丈夫蓄養歌女·便僱幾個查探員尾隨他·他們追蹤到城外的一座房屋去，那裏是那歌女的住宅，但是他們不能進屋裏去，那裏的僕役，都不受賄賂。他們把電話線割斷，由一查探員冒充修理匠，到屋裏去修理電話·但是找不到什麽證據·最後，那些查探員就亦馬路的對面搭個食　，出售麵包　腸，那個富翁識破這個詭計，就决定將他的情人遷到一個人跡罕到的地方去。但是出乎富翁意料之外，那　搬運工人，也是那個偵查所的「同謀」人員，這些搬運工人，就在那個歌女的寫字桌上的一些函件和賬單內，獲得一切離婚所需的證據。</p>
<p>誰在幹這種巧妙的工昨呢？，各式各樣的人物全有。不管那一種人、必要時私家偵查所都會僱用，由語言專家以至機械師，由勾人魂魄的妖女，以至黑種碼頭。在馬路上閒蕩的小無頓，也許是為他的僱主的利益在窺察你的動作。要是你是個銀行的出納員，也許櫃檯外那個衣服都麗的女人，正在注意　的行為。要是你參加一個豪華的婚禮，有各種華貴的禮品陳列着，或者有個穿禮服的紳士，在張目注視你和全體的客人。這都是你所意料不到的。</p>
<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>佛郎哥，這個希特勒與莫索里尼的結晶品，現在也居然擠入了勝利的獨裁者之列了。矮矮的身材，一副拿破崙的面孔，誰也會想他又是個魔王；但，實在，他倒也流露着相當的天眞。</p>
<p>西班牙內戰正緊時候，一位美國記者去訪問他，談話如下：</p>
<p>問：佛朗哥將軍，你的大炮那兒來的？</p>
<p>答：德國貨。</p>
<p>問：你的飛機呢？</p>
<p>答：意大利貨。</p>
<p>問：你的軍隊呢？</p>
<p>答：爾康人和一些外國雜種。</p>
<p>問：那麽，你的營盤中，豈不是一點點西班牙的</p>
<p>東西都沒有了嗎？</p>
<p>答：有的是，做靶子的，不</p>
<p>都是西班牙人嗎？</p>
<h3>海上風雲</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　機璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九</p>
<p>一四年秋，德美航輪『凱隆柏齊號』，載着六百萬金條，到德國去，邱克斯公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲，在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯蒙加羅，和船上的德籍無線電員鮑佛，傑克在代飽工作時，接着個怪消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便無目的地狂奔起來……</p>
<p>船長拒絕了滅低速力的建議，把一切委諸命運。他說，寧願這船遇見任何危險，遭了毀滅，但不願被敵人俘去。一種新的憤怒，傳播到全船·一堆一堆的人們，又麋集起來，譴責船長的態度，後來，又有許多人重去見船長，他很客氣地招待他們，可是，無論如何，不肯滅低速力，不肯點上燈。</p>
<p>在這時候，傑克正在守着他的職務，比爾情願陪他度着漫漫的長夜，船長已經有命令下來，一切無線電信件都禁止收發，恐怕被敵人巡洋艦查出船的位置。</p>
<p>因此傑克簡直沒有什麼事可做了，只是很舒服的靠在椅子里，將聽音筒掛在耳朶上，隨便和比爾談着這些目前的情景，時間就這據溜過去了，但是，突然地，使他提起袖來，在無線電中，傳來了兩艘船在對話的聲音。他聽了一會，知道是兩條英國船，「卡利唐納」和『瑪莉莎』。</p>
<p>但是，話倒挺使他有點憂形於色。</p>
<p>『又有什麽事了？』比爾注意到傑克的神色，「若是巡洋艦來了，我倒不在乎，因為，只有德國人，和奧大利人會被捉去當俘虜，我倒情情願會被　們追看。」</p>
<p>「這事情比被俘據更壞呢。」傑克接着說，聲音有點悽慘。</p>
<p>「那末，是什麼事？」</p>
<p>『冰山，』傑克直截了當的說了出來。</p>
<p>『這時候，會有冰山？』比爾不信，因為在船隻常走的　線上，八月裏是很少有冰山阻路的。</p>
<p>「就是這話，卡利唐納號正警告瑪莉莎號，說西北方有很厚的冰山，你總能記得，我們現在所航的路線，已經存通常航線的北面很遠了·所以這時候會有冰山，也不算奇怪。』</p>
<p>『這可眞是倒霉！你現在預億怎樣？』</p>
<p>「立刻去報告船長，」傑克决定之後，姑起身來，取下他的聽筒。</p>
<h3>氣象臺</h3>
<p>香港天氣，眞是沒有辦法。昨天天氣香港天文台預測，是好天·氣象台也說不壞。可是，結果，昨天，又風，又雨，又雲，又悶。這才叫幻變多端，不測風雲。以後唯一的辦法·還是少談為妙。除有非特別值得報告的再說。</p>
<p>今天很有幾個　消息，介紹于後，每天晚上，路出報館，走在街上，一不留心氣，就會踏着人，露宿的同胞，眞是密密排排。現在說當局已决定遷送露宿婦孺老弱入難民營工作，眞是功德無量。</p>
<p>第二是已决定為孤軍改建新營，預計用欵十二萬港幣其中有中國政府津貼十萬法幣。</p>
<p>最後，大坑械鬥的事，聞「警察當局大為震怒，認為若不嚴厲處分，不足以維持治安。」善哉。善哉</p>
<p>但願以後常常說着這類的好消息。</p>
<h3>小問題</h3>
<p>有貪得者三人，入林採梨，盈筐而囘，夜，甲起數果，分三份後，尚餘一個，食之，藏去一份。稍遲，乙亦起，將　下兩份，分作三股，又多一個，亦食之，蔽去一份。稍遲，丙亦起，如法泡製，亦多一個，食之，藏去一份。天明，三人平均分果，又多一顆。……請問三人共採同梨若干個？</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>一個强盜闖進了一家高大的摩登銀行，抽出手槍，對着一個在窗口邊的行員：喂，請把錢統統都拿出來。那行員半理不理的，用筆向左邊一指：「向左邊第三個窗口·」說完了，又儘自爬在檯上畫圈圈了。</p>
<p>這强盜倒莫明其妙起來：</p>
<p>『什麼意思，你這兒不是堆着許多鈔票嗎？幹嗎一定要到左邊第三個窗口？』</p>
<p>那位行昌可不耐煩了：</p>
<p>「你這人眞煩，告訴你，這兒是收欵處，付款的在那邊。」</p>
<p>街頭即影——夜</p>

<h3>法幣匯兌的新措施</h3>
<p>— 壟家麟</p>
<p>（三）新措施的意義在管理通貨制之下、一國貨幣對外匯率原非一成不變，苟一項匯率已不適國情則强為維持非特無益、抑且有害、尤其是在淪陷區經濟中心的上海、政府在政治上已失其管轄的能力、無限制供給黑市外匯、確有值得考慮的餘地、這種意見、我們早就說過、到最近偽「華興銀行」成立、又圖用華北」聯銀」的故技、在華中以偽鈔　換法幣套取外匯、更使我們覺得政府對外匯有作進一步統制的必要（見拙著「華興銀行的發行政策及其前途」），現聞政府擬調擊匯價並規定以後正當商人因無法向中央銀行申請法定外匯得憑定貨單向外商銀行無限制購取外匯、此舉正合我人之意、分析起來、至少具有下列四點價值、</p>
<p>一、調整貿易近月來中國各通商口岸的貿易，有一點頗堪注意、就是政府統　各口岸均有出超，而淪陷各大商埠則因政府權力不及、致有巨額的入超、這種分劃是很顯明的、依據海關統計數宇、本年首季政府統治主要各口岸計蒙自出超八，一二一千元、瓊州出超二八五千元、雷州出超二、四四八千元、汕頭出超五、〇三八千元，溫州出超四、〇三二千元、合計此五處出超約二千萬元、但淪陷區單滬津兩埠、入超卽達九千餘萬元此種現象、政府雖不能以直接的方法加以校正、但在市場上暫時撤銷外匯平準基金的支持、然後再覓一適當的匯率以穩定之、實在不失為一個聰明的辦法、在今日淪陷區政府不能用政治的力量以統制貿易、這恐怕也就是唯一有效的辦法、</p>
<p>二、減少日貨進口　日本鑒於日金準備的　趨枯竭、為吸收外匯計、將一部剩餘的商品（卽不能以　價在海外推銷者）竭力向中國淪陷區推銷，但他們並不願意收囘在華的日圓與軍用票、於是以此等鈔券換取法幣，再調外匯、最近華北的出口統制限定某幾項土貨輸出以外幣結價、也就是這個道理、剩餘商品推銷的結果、是日貨輸華的激增、本年首季達七千數百萬元之巨、高踞各國輸華數值之首位、這巨額輸入的法幣準備、便都被日人吸取去了、如果匯兌平準會對於法幣購買外匯予以限制、則日本對華的輸出勢將得不到外匯（指美元英鎊之類）、或將以更大的代價換成外匯、那末日貨輸華、無形中目可滅少。</p>
<p>三、防止偽幣套取外匯上月中旬華中　華『興銀行』的成立發鈔、無疑的也是這次新措置要因之一、我們記得去年華北「聯銀」成立、政府卽施行外匯請核　法、那末這次「華興」成立·政府再度强化統制、也就無足驚異了、「華興銀行」鈔券現在的流通額雖尚有限、但我們有種種的理由、推測『華興券』未來必趨膨脹、為防患於未然起見、對於以偽券吸收法幣套取外匯的故技、自有預加防範的必要。</p>

<h3>青年底舊嗜好從那裏來的？</h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>幾年前，曾經有人把「五四運動」時代舊文學家嘴上的話抄下來指導靑年，那話是：「要新文學好，舊文學先得有根抵纔行！」這話在「五四運動」時代，本是舊文學家底一條妙計·那時因為新文學勝利了·舊文學家感到了危險·便想出了這樣的一句話，要一面拉住舊文學。一面又向成了名的新文學家送一下一秋波」·可是現在，也有人在說這話，而他們却是「貨眞價實」的新文學家。那作用倒好像因為有些青年作家，寫得比他們高明·看得不耐煩·於是抬出售文學來威嚇一下，意思是：「你們不要得意·那樣寫法到底總是不行的！」自然，這也確把自己底地位給相當的　住了，不過對於靑年可實在沒有好處。從前舊文學家用這句話引誘得一般新人物爬了上去，做了先賢，烏烟瘴氣地談了一通「國故」·開　幾張所謂國學書的目錄·可是這回却只能使靑年垂頭喪氣，不敢冉寫·這叫作「一代不如一代」·結果呢，除了使青年染上些連本人也莫明其妙的舊嗜好而外，却是甚麼花樣也沒有留下。</p>
<p>而同時也就來了方塊詩。那是新詩，作者又多半是得外國文的人，並且　宣言是模倣外國底甚麼體的。但讀者却很奇怪，不能賞識那種藝術，要讀下去就非打瞌睡不可。這便暗暗地　了從前舊文學家底預言：「中國文學根本和外國文學不同，要模倣外國就會弄得不像樣！」而且事實也確是不錯的，詩旣寫成了方塊，又沒有詩味！那麽，還不如五言，七言，爽快得多了。於是又有新文學家出來自己打成了一通耳光，說新詩能否成立，實在還是問題。這一來，舊詩便眞的抬頭了·你一首，我一首，大家都　起袖子做起來了。結果呢，除了使靑年染上些連本人也莫明其妙的　嗜好而外，却是甚麽花樣也沒有留下。</p>
<p>不知道怎麽弄的，忽然又來了『京派　」和「海派」的吵架。吵出的結論是：「京派」行，「海派」不行·於是「海派」奮袂而起·追隨了「京派」·從此大潮流產生了。「性靈文學」是眞正的文學，「語錄文」是前進的文體。「性靈」底祖宗本是明人底小品文·但不久却擴大到所謂「珍本」·自然，這是好的，但有些「本」却　在並不「珍」，後來竟連葉紹袁給自已老婆編的半眞半假的詩集也成了靑年必讀的寶貝了。「語錄文」不像「白話文的嚕　　囌」，這當然也是好的，可以省些紙張，但省下的紙張却去印文言相舊詩·而最古怪的是「性靈」派的大師却又捧出了個「野叟曝言」·——這潮流可眞把人　得頭昏眼化起來了。結果呢，更加不用說，除了使青年染上些連本人也莫明其妙的舊嗜好而外，却是甚麽花樣也沒有留下。</p>
<p>在教帥方面，也是先由『京派』的前輩發起了運動，考試的學生寫錯了一個字，考官便動起筆來大大地挖苦一通，而挖苦的方法也是做舊詩，——打　的薔詩·這又使得「海派」的後輩美慕了起來，於是主張靑年在古書裏尋字彙·到底靑年尋出了沒有，似乎還沒有人調查過，不過從主張者底口氣看來，要不去尋，是會給他們扣分數的。而且事實上可也眞怪不得·許多大學招考的國文試題都在搬古書，不是「易經」，便是「儀禮」，好像越古　越合式。其實出那些題目的人，也未必能够不查書就都知道，要他們換作學生去投考，說不定還會交白卷吧。但總之結果呢，不用說越發是除了使靑年染上些連本人莫明其妙的嗜好面外，却是甚麼花樣也沒有留下。</p>
<p>這些都是我們名人底功績。算來自然也並不很多，但就是這幾件已經很可以把一些靑年拉到倒車上去了。</p>
<p>我同意前幾天尚卿先生底主張，應該全體當教師的人認眞給靑年一點好的指導·但是實際上是不是做得到呢？</p>
<h3>鄉村冬夜景</h3>
<p>— 于塞夫</p>
<p>素樸的飄雪的日子裏，我會經在一隻熾旺的炭爐邊編織了許多說不完的故事。而那個聆聽者，靜穆地側着頭國瞪了眼珠望着我的臉。</p>
<p>我很不喜歡人們牢看住我的臉，於是，不耐煩地說：</p>
<p>「我的故事難道塗着顏色麽？」</p>
<p>那個聆聽者臉紅了，不高興地尖着嘴說道：</p>
<p>「是的，　着顏色的原故呀！」她不再望着我·她祇是用一隻筷子，撥着紅旺的炭。</p>
<p>我挾着外衣，悄悄地走開了。</p>
<p>在風捲着雪，雪捲着風的廣闊的夜的天空下，我深深地呼吸着淸沁的冰冷的空氣，我在白色的原野間奔走，一直到我的鞋子完全濕透，才悄悄堆囘到屋子裏去。</p>
<p>屋子裏的炭爐中的火，已經熄滅；好像我編織過的那些故事還網在屋子的每一個角隅。然而，那個聆聽者走掉了，她給我留了一個條子：</p>
<p>——可志，你說日本鬼子的瞄準比我們來得好，我不信！你說日本鬼子會利用地形地物，我想我們也不會不行……還有，你的那一套古怪脾氣，我想日本鬼子也夠不上你……</p>
<p>這幾個字寫得很模糊，很潦草，因為是用鉛筆寫的原故，在油燈下我望了許久，才辦出字跡來。我不禁獨自笑起來。</p>
<p>軍號聲響了，許多暗黑的影子，排列在潔白的原野上，大家都是默肅的，沒有一點糟雜的聲音。</p>
<p>森林在吹噓着寂寞的幽冷的調子，森杯在風雲中搖撼，森林變得蒼老了，它披　白的髮，夜空賦與它一種峻嚴。</p>
<p>所有的茅屋都蓋上了潔白的被，裏面再也沒有星星小紅火了。……人們排列在潔白的原野上，一種溜冰樣的跌滑的聲音，遠佈開去：</p>
<p>「一，二，三，四……」</p>
<p>空渙的單純的原野上，人們的晤黑的影子，在雪中，變成了深濃的玫瑰色……</p>
<p>「挺起胸脯來，同志們，不要怕冷！我們看看有什麼東西忘記帶了的？同志們，想一想，老百姓的門板上好了沒有？……」</p>
<p>尖說的聲音一停下來，就給風雪整個的捲去了。剛才那個圓瞪着眼珠的我底故事的聆聽者！像所有的戰士一樣地背起了包裏，她腰帶上還掛着一支「勃朗林」，看到我就直率地說：</p>
<p>「把×人估計得太低，或是過高，都是要不得的！」</p>
<p>我並沒有接下去說什麽，我只是輕輕地告訴她：「同志，你知道現在是夜行軍的時候呵。」她排列入隊伍去了。</p>
<p>雪花飄在我們的臉上時停留不久，就會溶掉的。風吹乾了臉上的雪水，於是，臉孔有一陣陣戟刺的刺痛。</p>
<p>樹梢上已經掛起了冰條。遙遠的白皚皚的山峯在投視着我們這一羣傢伙似的，但是，我幻想着：我想，要是這麽龐人的山峯，能够有一日歌唱起來的話……</p>
<p>於是，春天——這個開朗的明媚的季節底投影，在我們的悉察悉察的步伐中浮出。</p>
<p>我們是這樣地生活看呵。</p>
<h3>奔泉</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>「光榮的泉水！願我心如你的新　，持久。向上，生生不息。」——Lonell</p>
<p>奔泉，我愛牠有力的激蕩。</p>
<p>不是黑水湫　綠得發霉的死水，不是停滯在一條狹狹的河內永遠那麽靜止的波流，不像湖水那末柔弱，輕佻而無力，也不那末平，祇向兩岸展開；牠向上，一股股力，朝上湧，不斷的開展，空氣壓不了牠，奔騰，夭矯如遊龍，　長的日月拖過一條灰色朦朧的影子，泉聲在一片矇朧中，奏出不斷的樂歌來·朦朧中，有金鱗閃爍。</p>
<p>沒有停止的時候，水永遠不會乾，山澗中，豁谷內，枯藤亂葉的山坡間，你去尋找吧，那兒永遠激蕩着一弘翠碧的漣漪，幽查無盡的小崖深處，懸掛下一幅西練的銀光，閃耀着太陽，也混和　山間的紅花，小草和樹葉，嘩浪浪的奔騰，表示出這是自然的巨樂，蓬勃生命的高歌。</p>
<p>探視泉源的無盡，你所感的不是失望，不是渺茫，你會因此更開拓生命的領域。</p>
<p>聲如說人生是一股奔流吧。人生該有一個核心，這猶如說，我們吃蘋果，梨子或胡桃，不都是有一個討厭的核心嗎？探討這核心，不比我們隨意撕去一個水果皮，或者敲碎一個乾果的硬殼。追逐那生命的眞理吧，這猶如說，探討那最後的泉源。</p>
<p>然而說眞理永遠沒有麽？我知道他有一個核心。「追逐那真理吧。」</p>
<p>我說，「我愛那泉源。」</p>
<p>我記得兩年前看過的景物。</p>
<p>是虎跑泉山門外。新綠點染上山坡。浮起一陣淸杳，山嵐撲眉。眉　然·在石縫中，靠土崖邊，崖上一排樹，有些不規律，又好像雜亂。樹陰蓋在泉水上，汨汨的徵聲，一片連響，透開陰　·像繫在耳朶上的繩，泉水聲跟着我走，　上石階……</p>
<p>也是在杭州，黯沈沈的楠本林中·去九溪十八澗，路上轉了幾個　，我走入　然的境地。湧　含蓄的力，流過狹窄的山崖，幾個盤旋，衝蕩　山石，濺開粒粒水珠·囘頭時，我漸漸走遠，望望那白石，我想，該是什麽時候流起的呵？我給他記算·</p>
<p>寒天暑天，他不停的在動，朝上湧，朝下流·現在我給他記算吧，他也還在流。流成曲曲灣灣的澗水，從山谷；低蔽於枯技亂葉間，載　紅舟，再流向不可知。也許重歸於山谷？</p>
<p>離開杭州時·給我自己計算一下，整整兩年了·舊日的泉水，已不知流往那兒去，連我家裏金魚盆中自製的一個小噴泉，也早已毀無得無影無蹤了。我失望嗎？不，我知道泉水仍然是在流，一分一秒地在流，不疲倦，也不休息。</p>
<p>拿石頭堵住了牠，也許你看到泉水有暫時停止的不幸，但這泉水的大量一衝開陣碍時，你知道他比以前更有力。把握住長期的生命，泉水永遠沒有死亡。</p>
<p>從沒有人制伏過泉水，我們知道有許多石頭已經腐　了。</p>
<h3>寫於營地三章</h3>
<p>— 今昔</p>
<p>寶劍</p>
<p>璧上的寶劍長　，窗外是凄凄細雨，案頭的書，永別吧！我要捨棄詩的夢</p>
<p>與歌的幻想，到赤熱的營地上，吐出忿恨的燄火，常同寶劍在一起，效學着戰士的笑。</p>
<p>營地</p>
<p>昨夜的露冷；今朝的霜重：軍號嘹亮地揚着，朝着遠的山林。抖落了征衣上的薄冰，我喊着：「遠方的雙親啊！兒子正等待着戰鬥，心中充滿了希望。」</p>
<p>戰馬</p>
<p>我的戰馬跟着我，有如是一個好友，當我衝鋒而受傷，牠立直在我身邊，牠的鼻子嗅嗅我，好像說：一起來！戰士，你還沒有打退敵人，必須再去衝一陣。」</p>
<h3>從成都到西安</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>六、民族英雄</p>
<p>他們按班打地鋪睡。地板上只鋪一把麥草，上邊只蓋一條毡子，這麽天寒地凍的季節，這怎麽能够受得住呢！夜裏，這兒那兒，　聲四起。有些咳得緊時，我懷疑他簡直是在吐血了。這樣忍飢受寒，患咳症是當然的。有許多勇士，就因此而還沒有趕到前綫，就得從隊伍中退出來了。但有無數　貴榮華的人，雖在此抗戰時期，物質的享受，還是好得像天堂般的·這些對照縈迴在我的腦際，無限的感慨打動着我的心靈，這一晚又失眠了。</p>
<p>軍隊于淸晨四時就起來了，把麥草收拾好，打掃一次才吃飯，飯後，弟兄們全出到街頭集合去後，又打掃一次，並把移動了的床板檯椅，撤囘原處，弄得淸淸楚楚，干干净净·抗戰後新訓練出的軍隊也進步了。</p>
<p>我也于四時就起來，呆看着弟兄們出發後，檢好行李，叫茶房拿到車上去，九時，從寧羌開出，向漢中進發了·</p>
<p>從成都到寧羌為四百四十公里，從寧羌到漢中則為一百二十五公里，出了寧羌縣城不遠，又是爬高山了。山名五丁　，一重復一重，高入雲霄，且很險。下山時，在一個高峯的北面，在羊腸路上拐了十六個　子才拐到山麓。聽說雲南的西南公路，在一處的山嶺間，拐了二十四個灣子才到山脚，那恐怕比這兒還要高而峻險了。從重慶這兒的地勢，似乎是重慶附近為高原的頂點，傾垂于揚子江，過了榮昌　境，漸漸往下傾斜，到了成都，為一望無　的大盆地，出成都　了　陽縣境，又是連　不絕的丘陵，一層比一層的高上去了；到這五丁關為頂點，之後，就逐漸低斜，傾垂于漢水，而從沔縣起，卽為漢中大平原了。</p>
<p>午後一時半，車抵武侯鎭，鎭已殘舊，位于漢水之傍：鎭的北門外，有武侯廟，為古式廟宇建染，有些磚瓦牆垣，已經坍倒了。漢水對岸的定軍山，有武侯墓，是一代英傑的諸葛孔明長眠處。在這抗戰吃緊之際而吊諸葛武侯的故跡，　慨可也多善哪。</p>
<p>武侯鎭　為沔縣縣政府所在地，年前因為土匪太多，常被包圍洗刼，才遷于鎭北十餘里之菜園子。從寧羌縣到沔縣，沿途堡很密。據一在這路上走熟了的東北同志說：碉堡之所以這麽多，原因有三：第一土匪多；第二，從前軍閥割據一個師長駐　幾縣，恐被他人侵擾，須講防衛的措置，第三，年前紅軍過境，競起自衛·現在雖則情形完全不同，碉堡也漸呈頽敗之象了。　（未完）</p>

<p>竊得卅元　意猶不足</p>
<p>前晚在樓中睡宿者除謨罕默得父子外、尚有謨氏之友和亞子，一共二人、事發時為昨晨四時五十分、當時萬賴　寂、謨氏父子三人正在睡夢中、當時室中各處門戶均已關鎖、突有賊匪一人不知從何處潛入樓中、首先將樓中電線截斷、卽在室內各處牆壁摸索，謨氏臨　前外衣懸于壁間袋中、有現款三十餘元、當被竊去，該賊竊得現欽後並拔出手槍搜素至謨氏睡床、謨氏父子三人當時已先後被搜索之聲驚　、仍見賊匪携有手槍、不敢作動、佯作熟睡、該賊以為　氏未醒、以手准之並　令不准呼喊、威脅謨氏交出夾萬鎖匙、</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>海南職業學校　昨日舉行　基本英語演說比賽</h3>
<p>利用八百五十個基本字成績斐然</p>
<p>廣大的求學羣衆到這暑期將屆，節候交換的時候，對於學校國地的風光，都有一種熱誠欣賞之願望。社會上對於這些材料，也是極願知道的</p>
<p>記者昨乘九龍大埔路海南職業學校柬請參觀該校幟業補習班基本英語科之英語演說比賽會，特于下十二時前赴該校，順便訪問，到時，見該項比賽適已開始，一種　　　究的空氣，充滿課堂，學生皆用英國O　Gden所製之八百五十基本字演說，訓練數月，頗有成績，各比賽者之演說題如「中英文修習之比較觀」「抗戰勝利之决心」「健康與讀書」…等等，包括方面很多，幷請約翰大學敎授英文名家劉威閣氏主持評判。結果以男生梁漢基，章賢洪，女生盧瑞貞三人獲獎，各得珍貴書藉獎品，同時並由劉氏演講「修習基本英語之必要條件」對於學習英文之方法與經驗，闡發甚多，一時與會者皆甚覺興奮，據該校校長方孝岳氏云「據數月來辦理此科之經驗，覺得此種基本英語雖是一種合理性的速成科口，但學者亦必有相當决心與勤力，愈是速成科目，愈要加倍努力，</p>
<p>該校夏季後將加設一普通初中部，以為升入該校職業高中之基礎，方氏云「因為覺得凡初中學生基礎不甚好的，進而入專門職業的高中，在教學兩方面，都感覺困難，所以現在特設一普通初中部，希望作一良好奠基之石，同時並附一夏令班，為此部學生補習功課，不另收費。」</p>
<p>對於職業學校的感想，方氏又云「最近全國第三　教育會議，對于僑民教育一項，决定增加職業學校之設置。　一項議决案，是很有價值的。單就香港而言僑民子弟年年為升學問題感覺困難、和在這非常時期中、流離異地，失學失業，重重交困的人，都有切實救濟之必要，所謂失學者，卽是從高小或初中畢業，或是有了這樣相當程度不欲再在普通學科上多費精力，願意從速獲得一種專門職業之技能，為了這個問題而彷徨岐路的人。所謂失業者，卽是有心從事職業，所苦身無一技之長，或進學校多年，而空空洞洞茫無所得，雖欲就職而苦無濟勝之具的人，這些人，前者應該入職業學校，後者應該入職業補習班，最近美國職業教育專家吉孫氏在他所著的「美國校外職業指導」一書中說，教育原刖是指導而非灌輸。社會上學生能升學的不多，學校方面多顧大量的功課灌輸，不注重個別技能之指導。這是不對的，吉氏所說美國情形，也正是我們應該向著這種教育上嶄新趨勢邁進的借鑑。又我國教育史上著名的宋朝胡安定的學制，有所謂『治事』一科，卽相當于現在的職業教育。他那種卽學卽用立應世務的精神，也是前代教育上良好的規模。這都是職業教育家所應注意努力的。」</p>
<p>此外聞該校職業補習班新增中文速記一科。中文速記在社會上急為需要。但欲學此項技術者，尚苦無門，除從前上海中華職業教育會有中文速記班外，尚無此項傳授，該校近聘中文速記發明家黃傳賓氐担任教授，黃氏此項發明，已呈教育部立案，完全照國語標準，實為中文速記方面最有效之目科，同時不熟國語者亦可同時藉此兼習國語。社會各機關中應多有人學習云。</p>
<p>至該校職業高中部，除新聞科農科照舊辦理外，現又增加職業補習班多種，如家庭工業班，農業速成班，新聞補習班、中文速記班，中英公牘班等，日內同時招生，學費一律盡量減輕、並擴充免費學額多名，以廣救濟，所請教授皆愼選特別經騐之專家人材云。</p>

<h3>昨日公開棒球賽　南華先生勝後敗　友碑大敗香港創得分記錄</h3>
<p>昨天烈日懸空、熱氣迫人、兩場公開棒球賽、如期舉行、第一戰南華會不幸以五比十受挫于西洋會、南華致敗原因、乃聯絡未得縝密、葉北華與朱國倫、演出殊劣、惟捕手何憲成、手段不凡、投手鄭康勇則欠經驗、然其最致命傷，在第三局竟負六分、不過此戰南華雖敗、其中尚有問題、聞南華將向聯會上訴、此問題發生於第四局中、</p>
<p>第四局南華作攻勢時、輪至司徒璧上場、得「自由一壘」、何憲成繼之上壘、當司徒璧偷佔第三壘時、投手投球與三壘手、截殺三壘、裁判員劉國璋，認司徒璧安全抵壘、但總裁判德忌利士、謂司徒璧將被殺死、判其出局、南華抗議無效、聲稱上訴、南華自此一挫更覺無心戀戰、黃耀東及吳邦振先後被殺死、此局遂瓦解、</p>
<p>第五局湯榮光先得「自之局、友碑隊卒以二十三對由一壘」、乘朱國倫之「安〇大勝、可謂打破年來本港全擊」進至二壘、鄭康勇大棒球之得分紀錄、茲將昨日發雄威、得一安打、送湯榮各場比賽成績錄後、究返本　、得一分、怕拉刺連擲「四球」、讓陳雨鈿登一壘、此時朱鄭陳分據三、二、一、三壘、成「滿壘」之優勢、及至葉北華上陣時、擊一高球、朱鄭陳冒險跑壘、不料此高球為比路度所接、先黜葉北華、繼投一壘殺死雨鈿、雅路維利士擲球與捕手、截殺朱國倫、結果造成「三殺」好戲、南華于是喪氣下場、西洋于四、五、六、三局中共獲四分、加上第三局之六分、總得十分、而南華全場僅得五分、遂見敗、</p>

<h3>從古代希臘談到　奧林匹克運動會的種種</h3>
<p>— 丁勞</p>
<p>叚珍貴的體育史</p>
<p>（二）斯已達的Daiaus是个連續三次競技會的優勝者、犯了叛逆的大罪被捕、然因市民投票免其死罪</p>
<p>（三）Callias因得競馬第一與四馬競定第二的優秀、竟與恢復祖國自由者的功積、列為同等、</p>
<p>（四）有老人名叫作Dagosas者他兩個兒子、均得着優勝、因歡過度、遂致一美—斷氣而死、</p>
<p>希臘體育的批評</p>
<p>第一、關於哲學家對競技優勝者的指　，如上所述，奧林匹克競技會的優勝者，可以享受那樣的光榮，直得人民這樣的愛載，然亦因此引起哲學家的疑惑，因為希臘在輿旺時代，言論自由對於意見的精神，其批評競技　公正的，要算生於小亞細亞Colophn的哲學家（Xenophanbe）570-480BC，他對於當時一般人所信仰的神，下過毫無忌憚的批評，他以為神的思想决不像人類一樣，面且競技優勝者並不是神的化身，那豫先知道優勝者為誰？更是絕對沒有的事，他自己對於競技也有很豐富的經騐，並不是袖手旁觀只會說空話的，他不過有了這嫌盲目地熱中競技的思想，含有危險的成份，因此說「她覺得競技優秀者，幷不是人生底幸福，因人所以出乎犬馬之上，重在靈智的所得的名譽，否則不過是傳統上愚昧的習慣罷了，例如善於鬥拳，角分，五項運動（當時的五項運動，為賽跑，相撲，跳躍，投標槍，投鐵餅）以及跑得快的人，或者可以說是名譽的事，但沒有國家因此而强盛的理由，優勝者或能滿足市民的欲望，但也沒有市民因此而得其福蔭的事實，這種議論，當然正在對於競技熱狂的羣衆，當然沒有人去他，百年以後，纔有一位Curipidei影響他，「斯巴達為提倡國防，去獎勵競技，對於體育算不得是積極的提倡」,這時候希臘的競技會，正是蓬　勃興的黃金時期，既沒有職業競技者的存在，亦沒有職業爭分的發生，哲學者有敏銳的感覺，犀利的視察，隱隱然發現了技競影裏所潛伏着墜落的萌芽，與播下了亡國的種子。</p>
<p>第二：關於競技的成績，希臘的紀錄是不足信的，因為他們證明競技優秀者為神力的表現，特地誇耀于其被征服的奴隸，使其戰慄而不敢背叛，例如Phaylles的跳遠為十八米突的Skylliao海衣潛入記錄為五基米突，甚至，斯巴達的Fobas日行千里，大力的Milar四歲時,把牛一拳打死，那竟成了神話的了。</p>
<p>第三：關於體育的學理；現在體育器械的繁多，是希臘人所夢想不到的，至於學理的研究，也是一樣，例如當時號稱大學問Platon的生理學家，不過隨便感想的筆肥，就是稱為科學之父的Aristatles也說筋肉不過與骨之間塡充的物質，不當作為運動機能，總之，古代希臘的體育，無非受天然地理的恩惠，為人類幼稚時代之舉動，故徒有經驗而無科學的研究，施行也僅及于少數的貴族，不普及于多數的民衆，貴族一朝衰敗，體育也就斷絕了。</p>

<h3>"Friends of Soldiers" Movement</h3>
<p>The National YMCA Military Service Committee has recently launched a nationwide campaign to solicit "Friends of Soldiers." In advanced civilized countries, this kind of movement is a regular organization, and it is of particularly important significance for soldiers of oppressed nations resisting aggression. This is because the soldiers of oppressed nations engaged in the battle of resisting aggression are, in terms of both material equipment and spiritual education, even more dependent on the assistance of the people from all walks of life, which is naturally more necessary and urgent. Our country's current War of Resistance against Japan is a war in which a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country resists a modernized capital imperialist country. Our soldiers, in order to win the final victory, are even more dependent on the sympathy and assistance of the people. Therefore, the supreme leader has repeatedly instructed the whole country that "people's strength is more important than military strength," and leaders from all sides have repeatedly encouraged each other with "final victory depends on the people" and "thoroughly realize cooperation between the military and the people." In fact, since the start of the war twenty-three months ago, whether in North China or Central China, whether it was the Battle of Taierzhuang or the Battle of Dahongshan, the importance of the people's assistance to the military can be seen in the great victories won. As for the widespread guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, the significance of the military relying on the people is self-evident.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the National YMCA Military Service Committee has established sixteen branches in various war zones to carry out comfort, rescue, training, and propaganda work. Judging from the achievements of the past year, the number of soldiers served by the association has been no less than four million. Recently, the association also plans to expand the sixteen branches into forty locations, with an additional 250 service personnel. The current launch of the nationwide campaign to solicit "Friends of Soldiers" is to seek the unanimous assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, so as to jointly work hard to actively promote this work. Its purpose is: (1) to implement cooperation between the military and the people; (2) to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance; (3) to fulfill the national duty; (4) to revive the martial spirit. In short, its work is nothing more than to do its duty as a friend to the soldiers resisting the war, to support the military service work, and to provide spiritual, material, and general economic assistance. Enthusiastically participating in this kind of movement should not only be the patriotic duty of every citizen, but also should be recognized as the right of every citizen to love the country. We should not only enthusiastically participate in this kind of movement to promote our great national spirit and national virtues, which have been passed down for five thousand years, but we should also, on a national scale, in the rear, in the war zone, and behind enemy lines, intensify and expand internal and external propaganda, and establish tens of thousands of organizations of "Friends of Chinese Soldiers!" The arduous struggle of Chinese soldiers today is not only for the liberation of China, but also for the defense of world peace, culture, and justice. We believe that this kind of movement can be widely launched!</p>

<h3>It's Not Easy to Live in Shanghai　Rice Price Reaches Twenty Yuan Per Dan　Enemy Puppets Plan to Control Fruits Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Shanghai News: The price of rice here is becoming more and more expensive due to the enemy puppet monopoly and the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants. Now each dan has reached 20 yuan, and the people of the whole city are quite panicked about food. The concession authorities are now dealing with general manipulation by unscrupulous merchants with strict means.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai News: The enemy puppets are again attempting to control fruits. They organized the so-called Shanghai Central Fruit Production Market Combination in Zhabei. The Shanghai Fruit Industry Association held a special meeting on the 15th and decided to unanimously refuse to participate, and signed an oath to show their determination.</p>
<p>The Incident on the Taixi Road is Resolved</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 18th] Yesterday, a large team of puppet police in western Shanghai, fully armed with pistols and wooden sticks, tried to cause trouble near the Public Concession. The British also dispatched a large team of British soldiers to rush to the scene, and the situation suddenly became serious, with a touch of hair trigger. Fortunately, after the British army negotiated with the puppet police officers, the puppets immediately withdrew, and the British army also withdrew, leaving only a few sentries on guard.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Shanghai News: The strike at the Shanghai Lun Chang Textile Factory, because the enemy puppets are instigating behind the scenes, has not been able to resume work. A few days ago, the puppet side suddenly invited the Westerners from the factory to meet with Zhu Yuzhen, the puppet district commissioner, expressing their willingness to mediate the resumption of work. At that time, the Westerners from the factory stated their solemn position and rejected all the puppet side's conspiracies, and still followed reasonable methods between labor and capital to resolve it.</p>
<h3>The Enemy is as Overbearing as Ever　The Situation in Tianjin is Becoming More Serious　Concession Authorities Ban the Export of Food from the Concession　Enemy Shoots a Russian, Large-Scale Anti-British</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] According to a certain Japanese news agency, Japanese officials claimed that if the British government takes "urgent and effective steps" to protect its interests in China, Japan will be forced to take all necessary measures to cope with the new situation. The Japanese government said that the British declaration was trying to "wash away the big mistake" caused by the British authorities' stubborn refusal to hand over the murderer who should have been extradited for murdering the Tianjin Customs Supervisor, and said that the British side hoped to invite a third country to intervene in this incident. However, Japan cannot accept it in principle. Japanese officials pointed out that the suggestion was made so late, which was completely inappropriate for the actual environment. The Japanese side also mocked that the expectations caused by this incident were that the British authorities in China would thoroughly "improve" their policies, and that the British policy was not related to the policies of other countries enjoying interests in the Far East, and that what was said in the British declaration was not true.</p>
<p>Fifth Day of Blockade</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 18th, Special Dispatch] According to Japanese sources, the severity of the Tianjin Concession dispute is increasing: (1) The concession has adopted self-sufficient measures, banning all flour owned by Japanese people from being transported outside the concession; (2) The Japanese side is sending traitors to give speeches in Tianjin's downtown areas and theaters to incite anti-British sentiment; (3) The Japanese side is still inspecting and making things difficult for pedestrians entering and leaving the concession. On the morning of the 17th, they also shot a Russian.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] According to Japanese telegrams, the Tianjin British Concession authorities yesterday ordered a ban on the export of flour from the concession, saying that this move aggravated the situation, because the Japanese side did not prohibit the export of vegetables, which is tense. This ban includes the transport of rented vegetables and other kinds of food into the concession for Japanese people and everyone else in the territory. [External News from Hong Kong] Tianjin News: On the 17th, a Russian person was storing flour and was considering dealing with such a situation when he was about to enter the British Concession. He was immediately killed by Japanese soldiers when he set up an obstacle at the Japanese solution. The Japanese authorities also heard that the English side was blocking the what the army was doing, was a serious provocation, and the Japanese soldiers are angry but that the Russian person was about to enter the Concession when he was shot and killed by the Japanese soldiers. British soldiers and Concession police were also present at the time, but they were unable to help.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin News: The Tianjin is scheduled to hold large-scale anti-British propaganda on the 17th and 18th, giving speeches on the streets, and holding a meeting at the Guomin Theater on Dongmalu. At that time, it will be broadcast by the puppet Tianjin Radio Station.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin News: The British and French Concessions are still under the enemy's continuous blockade and siege in Tianjin. Therefore, the inspection at the various intersection points is as strict as ever. Passengers traveling back and forth must go to the intersection points in advance at 3 am and wait until 5 am before the inspection begins. There are many people waiting for inspection at the British Concession International Bridge. Because they are exposed to the scorching sun, more than a hundred people have suffered heatstroke and fainted. When the inspection stopped at 6 pm, there were still people who had not been able to pass. The enemy's cruelty and disregard for humanity is truly indignant. The Italian Chamber of Commerce has packaged and transported some goods into the city, and has dredged through the enemy soldiers at certain places outside the intersection, but only a small amount can be transported in. However, due to the lack of natural ice and the hot weather, the vegetables, fish, and meat stored in the concession have all rotted, and the catering industry has suffered the most losses. Even foreign businessmen are suffering, and everyone hates the enemy. All the wharves and factories have been suspended because the workers have been blocked outside the concession. Hundreds of thousands of residents in the urban area and the Japanese Concession who used to make a living in the British and French Concessions have now completely lost their livelihoods. Some enemy merchants have been isolated from the British and French Concessions, and the sales of goods have also been interrupted, so people's hearts are greatly panicked. The has taken great pains to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>Fourth Day of Blockade</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin Foreign News: Yesterday was the fourth day of the Japanese blockade of foreign concessions. Various restrictive measures around the concession are more severe than before, which has made the food problem even more serious. Japan originally prohibited Chinese people from transporting food into the concession. Yesterday, it sent speedboats to patrol the rivers outside the Special Zone, and ordered all those carrying food to the British Concession to turn back. The Japanese side has also implemented strict restrictive measures on the southern border of the British Concession, and the required food can no longer be transported in from that side. At present, the vegetables stored in the concession are becoming increasingly scarce, and pork is also in short supply. Therefore, the Japanese restrictions are making the situation more serious. The temperature in the concession is currently around 100 degrees, and ice is extremely needed, which cannot be considered a luxury. In fact, the source of ice has also been cut off. The original ice storage will inevitably melt very quickly under such hot temperatures. Artificial ice plants are not fully equipped and cannot meet the current urgent needs of all parties. This is a very noteworthy event in the Japanese implementation of a "bloodless siege" of foreign concessions. Today, a large number of Chinese people are densely packed outside the concession, arranged in rows waiting for the Japanese to check them in order, and then allow them to enter the concession. In addition, everything in the concession is still calm. According to several Chinese people who entered the concession, they witnessed several farmers carrying burdens and baskets on the evening of the 16th, standing in line outside the concession, waiting for the Japanese to check them, hoping that the Japanese would allow them to pass, so that they could sell their hard-earned agricultural products to the concession. However, they have been waiting until now, for two days and two nights, and the Japanese have not yet allowed them to pass. It is estimated that only 200 Chinese people are allowed to enter the concession at each entrance every day. When Reuters visited Changzhi Vegetable Market, only empty stalls were seen everywhere, and only a few withered vegetables were arranged, which no one asked about. Meat shops only have a small amount of mutton left, and whether it is still fresh is questionable. There is still about 50 pounds of fish in the vegetable market, but because there is no ice to preserve it, buyers turn away after seeing it. During this Japanese blockade of the concession, the Japanese side does not hinder any Chinese people in the concession who wish to move out, especially those who wish to move to the Japanese concession. However, although the Japanese side has provided so many conveniences, the number of Chinese people moving out of the concession is still not large. This phenomenon is worth noting. The Japanese side has recently opened up a new road connected to the British Concession, which used to be rarely visited by pedestrians and has now become the main passage. The dense crowds are not scattered all day long. Rickshaws, handcarts, donkey carts, and trucks are also constantly on the road, because the road is accessible in all directions, not only connected to the British Concession, but also from this road to the Special Zone to the Japanese Concession and Chinese territory. British people in the concession are unwilling to be insulted, to lose their dignity, or to be harassed, so they are unwilling to leave the concession. However, there are still a few British people who must leave the concession due to their duties.</p>
<h3>British Warships Sail to Quanzhou　To Protect Merchant Ships　Enemy Ships Prevent Passengers on Ships from Landing</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 18th] Yesterday, Saturday, a certain British merchant ship, loaded with passengers from Xiaoluson, attempted to sail to Quanzhou Port north of Xiamen, but was approached by a Japanese warship, which requested the British shipowner to pass the Japanese warship. However, the shipowner refused its request. Only a small number of passengers were able to land, because the coastal fortress prevented them during the day, and the Japanese army fired shots at the passenger barges at night. The British naval commander has now ordered a British destroyer anchored in Xiamen to sail to Quanzhou to maintain the British ship and sail it back to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Wen Zongyao and Others　Unconscious　Poisoning Case at the Japanese Consulate General in Nanjing　Enemy Puppets Frightened Residents</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai News: People from Nanjing said that after the poisoning case at the Japanese Consulate General, the traitors such as Wen Zongyao are still unconscious and their lives are in danger. The Japanese side conducted a large-scale search, and the puppet police extorted a lot of money. If they are not satisfied, they will be arrested. The situation is tense, and the residents are uneasy.</p>
<h3>Delegation of the National Comfort Association　Departs for the Front to Offer Comfort　Telegrams to the Whole Country Request Response</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] The General Association of the National Comfort Committee for War of Resistance Soldiers telegraphed the provincial and municipal party headquarters and the provincial and municipal mobilization committees on the 18th, saying: The soldiers at the front have been fighting bloody battles for nearly two years. In addition to regularly transporting comfort items, the Association has specially organized two frontline comfort delegations, which have been assigned senior personnel to participate by Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang of the Central Standing Committee, and personnel have been sent by relevant agencies and groups to join. They are scheduled to depart from Chongqing on June 20. Ma Chaojun and Xie Zuomin have been appointed as the head of the Southern Delegation, and Guo Moruo and Wang Dayu have been appointed as the heads of the Northern Delegation. The Association has now prepared banners, clothing, medicines, publications, comfort letters, etc., and 240,000 yuan in cash to purchase comfort items locally, which will be transported to the front lines with the delegation. In order to expand the impact of comfort, we hereby telegraph your provincial and municipal party headquarters and mobilization committee. If the local people donate comfort items temporarily when the delegation passes through, it will be even more meaningful to participate in the event. However, please inform the local people's groups that the Association has limited transportation, so we hope that they will find their own way to transport the comfort items they donate, so as to avoid difficulties. The National Comfort Committee for War of Resistance Soldiers, printed in Chongqing on the 18th.</p>
<h3>× "Prospects with the Asia Development Board"</h3>
<p>—Increasingly Sharp Internal Conflict—</p>
<p>[People's Revolutionary Society, Jinxi Correspondence] Since the so-called "Asia Development Board" of the Japanese fascist military clique was established in mid-December of last year, personnel and other organizational issues have attracted the attention of the general public in Japan. The main reason is whether the "Asia Development Board" can replace the Special Affairs Department. However, among the matters agreed upon by the × Cabinet, one item is that after the establishment of the "Asia Development Board" in China, it will immediately take charge of all political, economic, and cultural affairs. The military Special Affairs Department and other agencies should hand over the above-mentioned affairs immediately after the establishment of the resident agency in China. Therefore, the Japanese military's agencies stationed in China need to determine their relationship with the "Asia Development Board," but whether the Special Affairs Department agencies can completely hand over political, economic, and cultural affairs has become a difficult problem for the × Cabinet to deal with.</p>
<p>The difficulty for the × people is that even if the former resident agencies in China of the three provinces of the navy, army, and foreign affairs are brought together, their policies and intentions cannot be consistent, which will inevitably reduce the effectiveness of policy implementation. Secondly, the work belonging to political and economic departments cannot actually be separated from war. If the "Asia Development Board Branch," which is directly under the Cabinet, has strong powers, friction will inevitably occur with local agencies.</p>
<p>This is a problem that the × bandit cabinet cannot cope with and is also a problem that has attracted the attention of the general public. However, this "attention" is excessive worry, as the × bandit warlords already have a plan "in mind."</p>
<p>Since Hiranuma succeeded Konoe in forming a cabinet, the power of the × bandit army has become even stronger than before. In order to use its new power, it must seize the greatest power in the struggles between the various factions in Japan. The Hiranuma Cabinet is actually still controlled by the Konoe Cabinet. Most of the original important cabinet members have not been replaced after Hiranuma took office and are still controlled by the military. Therefore, no matter what the organization and intentions of the "Asia Development Board" are, or what the conspiracy to build a new order in East Asia is, it is always aimed at the goals and interests of the warlords. In terms of personnel, the military is adopting monopolistic and dictatorial methods. The establishment of the "Liaison Department" is a concrete realization of this "method."</p>
<p>The main agency implementing the policies of the "Asia Development Board" is the "Asia Development Board Liaison Department." It was established simultaneously on March 1 in five locations: Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hohhot (Gui Sui), and Xiamen. "Liaison Department Branch Offices" were also established simultaneously in Kaifeng, Zhangde, Taiyuan, Nanjing, and Hankou. The heads of the Liaison Department are concurrently held by naval officers. It has now been decided that Kita Seiichi (降軍少將, a defector Major General) will be stationed in Beiping as the head of the North China Liaison Department; Sakai Takashi (陸軍少將, Army Major General) will be stationed in Suiyuan as the head of the Mengjiang Liaison Department; Toa Haruzō will be stationed in Xiamen as the head of the Xiamen Liaison Department; Shibata Yaichirō (海軍大佐, Navy Colonel) will be stationed in Qingdao as the head of the Qingdao Branch Office; and the Taiyuan Branch Office will be concurrently held by the head of the × Special Affairs Agency, Hagiwara Nahuao. The heads and deputy heads of the above-mentioned Liaison Departments are all filled by investigators from the "Asia Development Board."</p>
<p>From this, we can see the following facts:</p>
<p>1. The heads of the Liaison Departments are all important figures in the military, and the "Asia Development Board" is simply another agency controlled by the warlords.</p>
<p>2. Even if the Asia Development Board Liaison Department is established, the Special Affairs Agency still cannot completely hand over political, economic, and cultural affairs, which means that the Liaison Department cannot replace the Special Affairs Agency. Not only that, but the Special Affairs Agencies in various places even have a陰　 to expand their powers, and this attempt has already been realized in Shanxi.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanxi only had the Taiyuan Special Affairs Agency and the Yuncheng Branch Office to handle political, economic, and security-related events. Now, on February 1, the Taiyuan Special Affairs Agency was upgraded to the "Shanxi Special Affairs Agency," and all the county liaison officers previously established were incorporated into the newly established Special Affairs Agency. The Special Affairs Agencies established in various parts of the province have now been formally established one after another, and the newly appointed heads have all taken office.</p>
<p>3. The simultaneous existence of the "Asia Development Board Liaison Department" and the "Special Affairs Agency," two aggressive agencies under the control of the warlords　, will inevitably increase aggression and pressure on China.</p>
<p>4. The heads of the Liaison Departments are army personnel in Beiping and Suiyuan, and navy personnel in Xiamen and Shanghai, which further proves that the Japanese land and naval departments each have their own intentions. Although they try their best to avoid conflicts, the contradictions between them are deepening day by day.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above points, we can see the arrogance of the Japanese × warlords and the powerlessness of the × Cabinet. Therefore, the establishment of the "Asia Development Board" is merely another tool for the warlords to invade and exploit China. The so-called construction of a new order in East Asia is just a smokescreen. However, although the Japanese × warlords hold great power, their internal conflicts are also deepening day by day. The power struggle between the Liaison Department and the Special Affairs Department also adds another opportunity. At the same time, the people of × will not be blinded by them, and anti-war sentiment is rising day by day. The so-called "Asia Development Board" is just wishful thinking. (湧上)</p>

<h3>The Situation in Tianjin Shows No Signs of Resolution; The British Government Formulates Retaliatory Measures; If Japan Does Not Repent, They Will Be Implemented</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Cabinet ministers who are currently in Beijing for the weekend are maintaining close contact with the outside world to prevent the situation in Tianjin from deteriorating. Foreign Secretary Halifax, who is resting at his private residence in Yorkshire today, is scheduled to return to London tonight. If Japan insists on its demands, the British government will consider retaliatory steps. According to reliable sources, the British retaliation may be: (1) suspending Japan's enjoyment of the "most-favored-nation" treatment under the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty; (2) prohibiting Japanese goods from entering British territory; (3) imposing extremely high import duties on Japanese imports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Foreign Secretary Halifax returned here from Yorkshire this afternoon and is still working in Beijing despite the weekend holiday. This shows the seriousness of the diplomatic situation, as the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are underway in Moscow, and the Tianjin incident shows no signs of easing. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the general situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] Regarding the Far East situation and the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Phipps this afternoon to discuss them. Afterwards, he also contacted the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, by long-distance telephone. It is reported that Britain, France, and the United States are currently informally exchanging views on the Tianjin incident, but responsible persons here attach great importance to the attitude of the United States, which is regarded as a decisive factor in future developments.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Regarding the Tianjin incident, cabinet ministers are currently waiting for continued reports. The Prime Minister left Beijing yesterday to　　spend the weekend holiday at　　　　, but he is still maintaining close contact with the Prime Minister's residence at Tang　　　. People close to diplomatic circles here hope that the Japanese government will　completely change its mind, conduct negotiations with Britain, and seek a solution, but if necessary, Britain will definitely take retaliatory measures　. As for the method, the commercial, financial, and foreign affairs departments have been studying it in the past three days and have prepared a report. It is preparing to be submitted to the cabinet for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 18th] Officials here stated yesterday that if the Tianjin situation has not improved by the end of this week, the British government may take three possible courses of action: (1) canceling Japan's original most-favored-nation treatment; (2) abolishing the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty, in which case Japan will be out of the great market in British colonies; (3) imposing heavy tariffs on all Japanese imports. Japan's financial capacity　has been greatly affected by the two years of war. If the British government actually implements the above three measures, it will further give Japan's financial position a more serious impact. It is speculated that the authorities plan to issue a statement on this matter in the House of Commons tomorrow. In the past three days, the commercial, financial, and foreign affairs departments have successively discussed various countermeasures to deal with the current situation. The recommendations of the three departments have been drafted in the form of a report. If the Tianjin situation has not improved by the end of this week, the government will take various measures, including the above three methods.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Scottish Affairs Minister Colville recently delivered a speech in Milton城, Sutherland, stating that the British government considers the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, to be a serious matter. It is hoped that the Japanese authorities will understand this in order to achieve a reasonable solution. As for British military preparations, after recent expansion, the strength is extremely strong, but it should not be　regarded as a threat to any country.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Secretly Discuss the Far East Situation</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The Japanese ambassadors to Rome and Berlin (Shiratatori and Shima, open supporters of the German-Japanese alliance) have recently held multiple meetings with German officials. It is reported that the situation in the Far East, especially the Anglo-Japanese dispute, was the subject of discussion. The Japanese ambassador to Italy arrived here five days ago. The "Foreign Affairs News," which first supported the Japanese military's actions in Tianjin, stated that countries that are ignorant of the times and consistently adopt reactionary foreign policies should know in the future that natural development cannot be prevented by stubborn and autocratic means.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] The "Radical Newspaper"戰称 states, "According to Italian newspaper opinion, the Tianjin incident is actually the implementation of a plan by the totalitarian countries to destroy the democratic countries. However, the information received by London, Paris, and Washington is not like this. According to diplomatic circles, Japan has decided to limit its actions." However, the "Paris Times" did not dare to make optimistic criticisms. The newspaper stated in an editorial, "Whether true or not, we believe that Berlin and Rome both know that they cannot avoid fighting a war on two fronts. Therefore, they are trying to induce Japan to fall into a de facto alliance with Germany and Italy. The method　is to promote Japan’s apparent self-interest, incite an Anglo-Japanese conflict, and weaken the forces of the democratic countries."</p>
<p>Japan Attempts to Force Britain and France to Stop Aiding China</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] According to local press criticisms of the Tianjin incident, "The Tianjin incident and other similar incidents involving British expatriates in China are pretexts used by Japan to create disputes. The real reason Japan is taking severe measures now is to drive Britain and the United States out of China and seize foreign concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other ports."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongbian, 18th] A special dispatch from London on the 18th reported that a correspondent from the Manchester Evening News in Paris stated that one of the aims of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin was to force Britain and France to stop transporting military supplies to China through Burma and Annam, to supply the Chinese army to fight against Japan. Therefore, all parties believe that the best way to deal with Japanese intimidation is to strengthen aid to China.</p>
<p>American Newspapers Urge Government to Take Active Action</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Republican "Washington Post" recently published an editorial on the situation in Tianjin, China, stating that the United States should not ignore it. The majority of Americans support the government taking more active actions. The problem that is currently occurring in North China is enough to affect the future of foreigners in China. Regarding the Tianjin incident, if Britain and France are forced to yield and accept Japan's demands as the price of stopping the blockade, it will create a precedent of special and significant meaning. The meaning is that the orders issued by Japan will have legal effect throughout the Far East. Foreigners must obtain Japan's tolerance before being allowed to reside in China and do business. Can this be tolerated? Japan's repeated acts of interfering with the legitimate rights and interests of foreigners have always lacked justification, especially this time. Therefore, all signatory countries to various treaties concerning the Far East must take responsibility and resist. In short, the United States has been increasingly confronting Japan in the past two years, and has great sympathy for China. Up to this point, Americans seem to think that in the current situation, the United States must take action.</p>
<p>French Figures Also Advocate Taking a Strong Stance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Landes, France, 16th] The French Colonial Issues Association held a conference here this afternoon, chaired by Oudry, the former Governor-General of French Vietnam. He made a speech strongly stating that Japan's actions in China directly threaten the security of French Vietnam. Since the Japanese military occupied Hainan Island, Haiphong Port has been threatened. The best course of action now is to build a military port in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, as a base for the French Far East Fleet. Colonial Minister Mandel is already carefully planning this matter. The conference then passed several key points: (1) advocating a strong stance to safeguard the rights that France maintains in the Far East, especially the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai; (2) if the Japanese cause further incidents, Britain and France should prohibit Japanese merchant ships from using their ports in the Far East as a means of retaliation; (3) supporting the proposal to build a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay.</p>
<h3>American Congressmen Debate the Neutrality Act All Day; The House of Representatives Is Scheduled to Discuss It at the End of This Month; There Will Definitely Be a Ruckus at That Time</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The new Neutrality Act proposed by Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion after being reviewed and passed by the committee, with two reports attached: (1) the report of the majority party on the Foreign Affairs Committee, namely the Democratic Party, in which Bloom compares his proposed new Neutrality Act with the existing Neutrality Act, explaining that the new act does not have any actual arms embargo provisions for belligerent countries, nor does it apply to countries that have entered into armistice; (2) the report of the minority party, namely the Republican Party, in which objections are raised to Bloom's proposal to authorize the president to declare the existence of a state of war and designate war zones, because the power is too broad, and opposition is expressed to the cancellation of the current arms embargo provisions. In addition, Bloom has reportedly decided to ask the House of Representatives to select a date within a week after the 26th of this month to discuss the new Neutrality Act. At this moment, people in the congressional lounge are saying that the Republican congressmen are strongly opposed, and some Democratic congressmen who support isolationism will also join them, but Bloom's proposal will definitely be passed by a vote.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Has Arrived in Danzig</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 18th] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived here on Saturday and entered the city theater.

<h3>The Japanese Side Used White Russians to Forcibly Seize the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin and Suzhou; The Soviet Union Lodged a Protest</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Actually Said They Did Not Know</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] It is reported that the Soviet Union has lodged a protest with Japan because the Japanese recently instigated White Russians to forcibly seize the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin. When the protest note was delivered to the Japanese ambassador, the Japanese ambassador said that he had not heard of this matter but promised to notify Tokyo of the protest note.

<h3>The British Admiralty Is Building Another Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] According to local reports, the British Admiralty will place an order with John Brown and Company of Carabincke next week for a 25,000-ton aircraft carrier, which will be of a newer design. The 35,000-ton "Duke of York" military ship built by the shipbuilding company is scheduled to be launched in September of this year, and it is expected that the King and Queen will preside over the ceremony at that time.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Negotiations Are at a Standstill; The German Side Has Repeatedly Transmitted New Soviet Demands; Guarantee the Eastern and Western States of Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] It is expected that the talks between the British and French representatives and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will continue on Sunday. The British envoy Sterron and the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union held talks this morning, but they will not meet with Molotov this week.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] According to a report from Moscow late last night, the British-Soviet representatives' negotiations have been temporarily shelved and there is no progress at all. The British representatives are currently trying to resolve major problems due to the situation in the Far East. It is heard that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's new proposal is that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must guarantee the eastern and western states of Germany. In other words, not only Belgium, Poland, Romania, Greece　, and Turkey, because these countries have been guaranteed, but also the Baltic countries should be treated equally if they wish to be guaranteed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 18th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the British and French diplomatic representatives will continue talks on the tripartite anti-aggression agreement tomorrow.</p>
<h3>French Colonial People Extend the Term of Military Service</h3>

<h3>The British King Tours St. John's; The Fishermen Give Him a Warm Welcome Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, St. John's, 17th] The British King and Queen landed in Electra today and received the warmest welcome from the local people. The scene was like a fishing village on the coast of Scotland. Dozens of fishing boats were around the pier, and the fishermen were all dressed in neat clothes to welcome the King and Queen. The harbor was quite foggy and there was light rain. The King and Queen felt extremely pleased with the sincere welcome. After the Mayor of St. John's delivered a welcoming speech to the King and Queen, the King laid a wreath at the war memorial. Officials and the administrative committee formally held a ceremony to see off the King and Queen. The King also personally performed the knightly　ceremony, which was a historic first in Newfoundland. Then the King left here at 8 p.m. (standard time) and returned to the country. A guard of honor saluted and saw them off at the shipyard. The warm hospitality of the people of Newfoundland to the King and Queen came to an end.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 17th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie returned here today and said in a speech, "I know that the King's visit to the United States and Canada will be a success, but I have not yet fully understood the greatness of this success. After the King's visit to Canada, I have seen the full cooperation of the provinces and cities of Canada, which is truly a great achievement. I have never known such complete unity before."</p>

<p>Small Review</p>
<h3>"The Work of the Wang Clique"</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: It is heard that the assassination of Qu Shao Yi, editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao on the 17th, was the work of the Wang clique. Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: Shanghai report, another seven or eight thugs broke into the Dao Bao on the 17th and opened fire, which is related to the Qu case.</p>
<p>Echoing the atrocities of the Japanese in Tianjin, Wang's henchmen are creating terrorist incidents in Shanghai again!</p>
<p>The targets of the Wang clique's rampant terrorism are the Shen Bao and Dao Bao, and their staff, which are generally trusted to uphold justice, seemingly in an attempt to blind the world. Regardless of how base and shameless their behavior is, the result will only increase the hatred of the Chinese people!</p>
<p>All people with backbone will spit on hearing "the words of the Wang clique." Now, please, countrymen, pay more attention to "the deeds of the Wang clique!"</p>
<p>Deputy Chairman Feng said: "Wang is a piece of rotten meat." Are we still tolerating the spread of germs by this piece of rotten meat to harm the people?</p>
<h3>Moving the Mausoleum South</h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, the mausoleum of Genghis Khan has been moved solemnly, passing through Yulin southward on the fifteenth of this month, with personnel dispatched by the central government escorting it along the way.</p>
<p>This news fully proves that under the frenzied invasion of the Japanese aggressors, all Chinese people have united firmly and closely.</p>
<p>For the past two years, the Mongolians have been fighting for the liberation of the great Chinese nation, creating a glorious page in history. This southward move of Genghis Khan's mausoleum further proves the Mongolian people's determination to support the unity of the Chinese nation and the sustained war of resistance. It further proves that all the plots of the Japanese and Mongolian traitors to incite chaos have failed to have any effect. It further proves the bright future of China's war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Even so, we must earnestly and thoroughly realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of nationalism and closely promote equality and cooperation among all ethnic groups in the country. We must, in the shortest possible time, pay homage to the mausoleum of the Mongolian ancestors, pay homage to the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and raise the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun at the Yalu River!</p>
<h3>Romania Leans Towards Anti-Aggression, Germany and Italy Try Their Best to Intimidate, and Prevent it from Concluding an Agreement with Turkey</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th] It is reported that Turkey and Romania will establish a military agreement, and the relationship between the two countries is becoming increasingly close. Romania will tend towards the group of England, France, and Turkey. Therefore, German political circles have issued warnings to Romania. Berlin claims that if Romania concludes a military agreement with Turkey, "the neutrality of the Balkan Entente countries will come to an end." The German United News Agency attacked King Carol of Romania for joining a policy that encircled Germany, and said that Italy would have something to say about it. Today, several semi-official Italian newspapers in Rome warned Romania, saying, "Italy will not tolerate the combination of countries to threaten the freedom of the Eastern Mediterranean."</p>
<h3>Shantou City Under the Cloud of War</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Bai Qun</p>
<p>Due to the tense situation caused by the attempted landing by the Japanese on the 7th and 8th, the already deserted Shantou city has become even more deserted. Many large companies and shops are completely closed. In the morning, only grocery stalls are selling goods. The population has thinned out to only two or three out of ten. Only a few pedestrians are dotted on the road, which is exceptionally lonely. The reporter, braving the slight drizzle, walked on the road and even hearing the bell of a rickshaw seemed hot and piercing.</p>
<p>Military police patrols are very dense. The military police supervision office has also sent several groups of people to check travelers coming from the port to prevent spies and traitors from infiltrating and engaging in activities. After the destruction of the Chao-Shan Railway, the only means of transportation in Shantou is by boat. To avoid attacks by Japanese planes, the ships sailing to various places depart in the early morning and evening. They take safety into consideration but cannot consider convenience, which is an unavoidable method.</p>
<p>Under the suffocating atmosphere of gunpowder, cultural undertakings in Shantou city have also been severely hit. Most schools are closed. Of the few remaining newspapers, Lingdong Min Guo Daily, Shang Bao Xinghua Daily, have also shrunk as much as possible. Printing half a page every day is already righteous, but news materials are also quite scarce, and paving the road has become an issue. However, in times of war, under the dual pressure of financial and material resources, we cannot be too demanding of them. Their ability to persist in their work is still an example of tenacious struggle.</p>
<p>It is an exaggeration to say that the Japanese are advancing on Shantou. The frequent appearance of Japanese planes in Shantou, on the whole, seems to be posturing in coordination with the blockade of the nine ports. The morale and strength of the people of Chao-Shan, under the instigation of Commander Hua, are quite high. I remember that General Weng Zhaoyuan, the founder of the Chao-Shan Self-Defense Corps, said to me when he passed through Huizhou a few days ago that the foundation of the military force of the Chao-Shan people is very solid and will not slacken their enthusiasm and determination to resist Japan due to the terrain. If the Japanese dare to risk landing, they will definitely cooperate with the army to launch a strong counterattack and destroy the Japanese. Finally, the reporter passed by Yu Shanhou and saw a Japanese shop that had been sealed up long ago. Recalling the Shantou of the past, the business and power of the Japanese and Taiwanese were quite strong. Now, the owners of each shop have not only abandoned the business they built with blood and sweat, but some even have to go to the battlefield to die. How cruel is the treatment given to them by the Japanese warlords! Therefore, the Japanese warlords are not only the enemies of China, but also the enemies of the Japanese laborers and small business owners! We must encourage them to resist. The Japanese anti-war slogans of the Political Department of the Kuomintang aroused the reporter's sympathy. Let us rise up and work together to overthrow the Japanese warlords! Japanese people!

<h3>Private Detective</h3>
<p>One of the 360 Professions</p>
<p>One day, in an apartment in New York, a woman, introduced by a friend, asked a female worker to try on a corset. The female worker found that this woman could walk, sit, and bend over like a normal person. This woman had sued the car owner in court for being hit by a car, claiming that her body had become paralyzed and demanding compensation for the loss. However, shortly after the female worker left, the court ruled against the plaintiff. The reason was that the female worker was a secret agent sent by a private investigation agency to collect evidence for the defendant's lawyer.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a wealthy man hired a private investigation agency to search for his 19-year-old son. The investigation agency discovered that his son was with a group of dissolute rogues and had become inextricably linked with a waitress. The investigation agency sent someone a few years older than the young man to befriend him and make him focus on music. Before long, this new friend gradually introduced the wealthy man's son into a group of more morally upright friends, finally leading him away from the wrong path, making him a musician in a band, and breaking off his relationship with the waitress.</p>
<p>You can't imagine where private detectives carry out their duties. Once, a real estate developer wanted to buy a piece of land, but the landowner refused to sell. So, he hired a detective to open a pig farm next to the real estate. Before long, the landowner had no choice but to welcome the real estate developer to buy the land.</p>
<p>There was a woman in Washington who suspected her husband of having an affair. Once, her husband went to the patent offices in Philadelphia and Washington on business, but she thought her husband had gone to a hotel with a female secretary. When her husband returned home, she questioned him and made a lot of noise. Although her husband firmly denied it, his wife refused to believe him. The next day, the husband took the matter to a private detective, who agreed to take on the case and told him, "In two days, you will go to the patent offices in Philadelphia and Washington again, and take your wife with you. But you should wear a white suit, tie a blue tie, and put a blue flower in your buttonhole." Two days later, when the couple got off the train in Philadelphia, a man came up to him, took off his hat, and said, "Hello, sir, would you like to put a mark on your luggage, like you did the day before yesterday?" His wife was still a little suspicious. But when they arrived at the patent office in Washington, the waiter at the door said to him, "Mr. Smith, you were just here the day before yesterday, why are you here again today?" Only then did his wife realize she was wrong and immediately asked her husband for forgiveness.</p>
<p>The detective's job, like other businesses, also has experts. The lowest-level personnel are tailers. Their job is to monitor the person being investigated at all times, mostly standing on street corners on rainy days or renting a room opposite the person's residence, looking out the window all day and night with a telescope. After their surveillance mission is completed, they write a very detailed report, which is revised and embellished by the staff in the office before being handed over to the client.</p>
<p>In contrast to the tailer is the enticer. He tries to cater to the person being investigated in every way to gain his trust. Once, a young man whose job it was to entice became acquainted with an elderly man who was being investigated. The two soon became very close, and the old man often invited him to his home to play. In this way, he saw some secret documents.</p>
<p>Whether lovely or hateful, female enticers in detective agencies often operate in ships, trains, hotels, offices, and factories.</p>
<p>The part-time secret agent is a specialist in both tailing and enticement. Their actions are spread throughout American industrial and social organizations. They mix among engineers, clerks, stenographers, and workers, and you can't tell that someone has worked in a factory for twenty years without being suspected by his colleagues. These people submit reports to their superiors every day, and sometimes what they say may just be empty talk for months, but sometimes the result of the report will cause those who are not diligent, dishonest, or troublesome employees to lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Detectives are the first-class figures of private detectives, and their income is the best. One detective once worked as a taxi driver in a divorce case, parking his car in front of the office of the person being investigated. The person being investigated was very satisfied, and every day he had a quick, lovely, and sensible driver to take him to his lover's residence, so he gave him a very considerable tip each time.</p>
<p>The wife of a millionaire in San Francisco suspected that her husband was keeping a singer, so she hired several detectives to tail him. They tracked him to a house outside the city, which was the singer's residence, but they could not enter the house, and none of the servants could be bribed. They cut the telephone line, and one detective pretended to be a repairman to repair the telephone in the house, but found no evidence. Finally, the detectives set up a food stall across the road, selling bread and sausages. The millionaire saw through this trick and decided to move his lover to a secluded place. But to the millionaire's surprise, the movers were also "accomplices" of the detective agency. These movers obtained all the evidence needed for a divorce from some letters and bills on the singer's writing desk.</p>
<p>Who is doing this ingenious work? There are all kinds of people. Whatever kind of person is needed, the private investigation agency will hire them, from linguists to mechanics, from seductive enchantresses to black dockworkers. The little hooligan who wanders around on the street may be spying on your actions for the benefit of his employer. If you are a bank teller, perhaps the well-dressed woman outside the counter is paying attention to your behavior. If you attend a luxurious wedding with all kinds of valuable gifts on display, perhaps a gentleman in a tuxedo is staring at you and all the guests. These are all things you wouldn't expect.</p>
<h3>One Person a Day</h3>
<p>Franco, the product of Hitler and Mussolini, has now surprisingly joined the ranks of the victorious dictators. Short stature, a Napoleon-like face, anyone would think he is another demon; but in reality, he does reveal a certain naiveté.</p>
<p>When the Spanish Civil War was raging, an American reporter visited him and had the following conversation:</p>
<p>Q: General Franco, where did you get your cannons?</p>
<p>A: German goods.</p>
<p>Q: What about your planes?</p>
<p>A: Italian goods.</p>
<p>Q: What about your troops?</p>
<p>A: Moors and some foreign mongrels.</p>
<p>Q: So, isn't there anything Spanish in your camp at all?</p>
<p>A: There is something, those who are used as targets, aren't they all Spaniards?</p>
<h3>Sea Storms</h3>
<p>— By Captain Lawton, translated by Ji Bi</p>
<p>Previous excerpt: In the autumn of 1914, the German-American ship "Ke Long Bo Qi" was carrying six million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Qiukes Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel in Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator, Lumon Garot, and Bauer, the German wireless operator on the ship. Jack, while working as a substitute, received a strange message saying that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then ran wild aimlessly...</p>
<p>The captain rejected the suggestion to reduce speed, entrusting everything to fate. He said he would rather the ship encounter any danger and be destroyed, but he would not want to be captured by the enemy. A new anger spread throughout the ship. Groups of people gathered again to condemn the captain's attitude. Later, many people went to see the captain again. He treated them very politely, but no matter what, he would not reduce speed and would not turn on the lights.</p>
<p>At this time, Jack was guarding his post. Bill was willing to accompany him through the long night. The captain had already issued an order that all radio messages were forbidden to be sent or received, for fear that the enemy cruisers would find the ship's location.</p>
<p>Therefore, Jack had almost nothing to do, just comfortably leaning in his chair, hanging the earphones on his ears, casually talking to Bill about the current situation, and time passed by. But suddenly, it made him perk up. In the radio, the voices of two ships talking to each other came through. He listened for a while and knew that they were two British ships, "Calidonna" and "Marisa".</p>
<p>But what they said made him a little worried.</p>
<p>"What's wrong again?" Bill noticed Jack's expression. "If the cruisers come, I don't care, because only Germans and Austrians will be taken as prisoners. I'd rather be chased by them."</p>
<p>"This is worse than being captured," Jack said, his voice a little miserable.</p>
<p>"Then what is it?"</p>
<p>"Icebergs," Jack said bluntly.</p>
<p>"At this time, there will be icebergs?" Bill did not believe it, because on the shipping lines, there are very few icebergs blocking the road in August.</p>
<p>"That's the thing. The Calidonna is warning the Marisa that there are very thick icebergs in the northwest. You must remember that the route we are currently sailing is very far north of the usual route, so it is not surprising to have icebergs at this time."</p>
<p>"This is really unlucky! What do you plan to do now?"</p>
<p>"Report to the captain immediately," Jack decided, then got up and took off his earphones.</p>
<h3>Weather Station</h3>
<p>The weather in Hong Kong is really unpredictable. Yesterday, the Hong Kong Observatory predicted that the weather would be good. The weather station also said it wouldn't be bad. But, as a result, yesterday, there was wind, rain, clouds, and humidity again. This is what is called ever-changing, unpredictable weather. The only way is to talk less about it in the future, unless there is something particularly noteworthy to report.</p>
<p>Today, there are several good news items to introduce. Every night, leaving the newspaper office and walking on the street, if you are not careful, you will step on people. The homeless compatriots are really densely packed. Now it is said that the authorities have decided to move homeless women, children, and the elderly to refugee camps to work, which is truly a great merit.</p>
<p>The second is that it has been decided to rebuild a new camp for the isolated troops, with an estimated cost of HK$120,000, of which 100,000 yuan in legal tender is subsidized by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the armed fight in Tai Hang, it is heard that "the police authorities are very angry and believe that if they are not severely punished, it will not be enough to maintain law and order." Well done. Well done.</p>
<p>I hope to often report such good news in the future.</p>
<h3>Small Problem</h3>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>A robber broke into a tall, modern bank, pulled out his gun, and said to a teller by the window: "Hey, get all the money out." The teller half-ignored him and pointed to the third window on the left with his pen: "The third window on the left." After he finished speaking, he continued to draw circles on the counter.</p>
<p>The robber was confused:</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Don't you have a lot of banknotes here? Why do I have to go to the third window on the left?"</p>
<p>The teller became impatient:</p>
<p>"You're so annoying. I'm telling you, this is the deposit window. The payment window is over there."</p>

<h3>New Measures for Legal Tender Exchange</h3>
<p>— Long Jia Lin</p>
<p>(III) The Significance of the New Measures</p>
<p>Under a managed currency system, the foreign exchange rate of a country's currency is not fixed. If an exchange rate is no longer suitable for the national situation, then forcibly maintaining it is not only useless, but also harmful. Especially in Shanghai, the economic center of the occupied area, the government has lost its ability to govern politically, and there is room for consideration in the unlimited supply of foreign exchange to the black market. We have said this long ago. Recently, with the establishment of the puppet "Huaxing Bank" and the attempt to use the old trick of the "United Reserve Bank" of North China to exchange legal tender for foreign exchange in Central China with counterfeit money, we feel that the government needs to further control foreign exchange (see my book "The Issuance Policy and Future of Huaxing Bank"). It is now heard that the government intends to adjust the exchange rate and stipulate that in the future, legitimate merchants who cannot apply for legal foreign exchange from the Central Bank may purchase foreign exchange from foreign banks without restriction with their order forms. This move is in line with our intentions. Analytically, it has at least the following four values:</p>
<p>1. Adjusting Trade</p>
<p>In recent months, one point is quite noteworthy in the trade of various commercial ports in China, that is, all ports under government control have a trade surplus, while major commercial ports in the occupied areas have a huge trade deficit due to the government's lack of power. This division is very obvious. According to customs statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the main ports under government control, Mengzi had a surplus of 8,121,000 yuan, Qiongzhou had a surplus of 285,000 yuan, Leizhou had a surplus of 2,448,000 yuan, Shantou had a surplus of 5,038,000 yuan, and Wenzhou had a surplus of 4,032,000 yuan. In total, these five places had a surplus of about 20 million yuan, but the deficit in the occupied areas of Shanghai and Tianjin alone reached more than 90 million yuan. Although the government cannot correct this phenomenon directly, it is indeed a clever way to temporarily withdraw support from the foreign exchange equalization fund in the market and then find a suitable exchange rate to stabilize it. Today, the government cannot use political power to control trade in the occupied areas, and this may be the only effective way.</p>
<p>2. Reducing Imports of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>In view of the exhaustion of Japan's gold reserves, in order to absorb foreign exchange, it is doing its best to sell a portion of its surplus goods (that is, those that cannot be sold overseas at a fair price) to the occupied areas of China. But they are unwilling to recover the Japanese yen and military notes in China, so they use these banknotes to exchange for legal tender and then transfer foreign exchange. Recently, the export control in North China has limited the export of certain native products to be settled in foreign currency, which is also the reason. The result of selling surplus goods is a sharp increase in Japanese exports to China, reaching as high as 70 million yuan in the first quarter of this year, ranking first among the values of exports from various countries to China. This huge legal tender reserve for imports has been absorbed by the Japanese. If the Foreign Exchange Equalization Council restricts the purchase of foreign exchange with legal tender, then Japan's exports to China will not be able to obtain foreign exchange (referring to US dollars, pounds, etc.), or will have to be exchanged for foreign exchange at a higher price, then Japanese goods imported into China can be invisibly reduced.</p>
<p>3. Preventing the Acquisition of Foreign Exchange with Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>The establishment and issuance of banknotes by the "Huaxing Bank" in Central China in the middle of last month was undoubtedly one of the reasons for this new measure. We remember that when the "United Reserve Bank" of North China was established last year, the government immediately implemented the foreign exchange application method. Then, with the establishment of "Huaxing" this time, the government has once again strengthened its control, which is not surprising. Although the current circulation of "Huaxing Bank" banknotes is still limited, we have various reasons to speculate that the "Huaxing banknotes" will inevitably expand in the future. In order to prevent problems before they happen, it is necessary to take precautions against the old trick of using counterfeit banknotes to absorb legal tender to obtain foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Where Do Young People's Old Hobbies Come From?</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ren</p>
<p>A few years ago, someone copied the words of old literati from the "May Fourth Movement" era to guide young people, saying: "If you want good new literature, old literature must have a foundation first!" In the era of the "May Fourth Movement," this was originally a clever trick by old literati. At that time, because the new literature had triumphed, the old literati felt the danger, so they came up with such a sentence, wanting to hold on to the old literature on the one hand, and on the other hand, to send a flirtatious glance to the new literati who had become famous. But now, there are also people saying this, and they are "genuine" new literati. The effect is as if, because some young writers are writing better than them, they are impatient and raise up old literature to intimidate them, meaning: "Don't be complacent, that kind of writing will ultimately not work!" Naturally, this does quite secure their own position, but it really doesn't benefit young people. In the past, old literati used this sentence to lure a group of new figures to climb up, become sages, and talk about "national heritage" in a smoky and murky way, opening a few so-called catalogs of national studies books. But this time, it can only make young people feel dejected and dare not write again. This is called "each generation is not as good as the previous." In the end, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.</p>
<p>At the same time, square poems also appeared. That is new poetry, and the authors are mostly people who have studied foreign languages, and they even declare that they are imitating some kind of foreign style. But readers are very strange and cannot appreciate that kind of art. They have to doze off to read it. This secretly confirmed the prediction of old literati in the past: "Chinese literature is fundamentally different from foreign literature, and imitating foreign literature will make it look out of shape!" And the fact is indeed correct. The poetry has been written into squares, and there is no poetic flavor! Then, it is better to have five-character and seven-character poems, which are much more straightforward. So, some new literati came out and slapped themselves, saying that whether new poetry can be established is really still a question. As a result, old poetry really raised its head. You write one poem, I write one poem, and everyone rolls up their sleeves and starts writing. In the end, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.</p>
<p>I don't know how it happened, but suddenly there was another quarrel between the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School." The conclusion of the quarrel was: the "Beijing School" is good, the "Shanghai School" is not good. So, the "Shanghai School" rose up and followed the "Beijing School." From then on, a great trend was produced. "Xingling Literature" is the true literature, and "Aphorism Literature" is the advanced writing style. The ancestor of "Xingling" was originally the Ming people's essays, but soon it expanded to the so-called "rare books." Naturally, this is good, but some "books" are actually not "rare." Later, even Ye Shaoyuan's half-true and half-false collection of poems compiled for his wife became a treasure that young people must read. "Aphorism Literature" is not like the "verbose babbling of vernacular literature," which is certainly also good, as it can save some paper, but the paper saved is used to print classical Chinese poems. And the strangest thing is that the master of the "Xingling" school actually praised "A Rustic's Idle Talk." This trend really makes people dizzy. In the end, it goes without saying that, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.</p>
<p>On the teaching side, the "Beijing School" elders also initiated a movement. If students wrote a wrong word in the exam, the examiners would start writing and ridicule them greatly, and the method of ridicule was also to write old poems. This also made the "Shanghai School" juniors admire them. So, they advocated that young people should look for vocabulary in ancient books. In the end, whether young people found them or not, it seems that no one has investigated yet, but judging from the tone of the advocates, if they don't look for them, they will have points deducted. And in fact, it's really no wonder. Many university entrance exam questions are copied from ancient books, either the "Book of Changes" or the "Book of Rites," as if the more ancient they are, the more suitable they are. In fact, the people who set those questions may not be able to know everything without looking up the books. If they were made to take the exam as students, they might even hand in a blank paper. But in short, the result is, needless to say, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.</p>
<p>These are all the achievements of our celebrities. Calculating it, naturally, it's not much, but these few things are already enough to pull some young people onto the reverse gear.</p>
<p>I agree with Mr. Shangqing's suggestion a few days ago that all teachers should seriously give young people some good guidance. But is it actually possible to do it?</p>
<h3>Winter Night Scene in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Yu Saif</p>
<p>On those plain and snowy days, I used to weave many endless stories by the side of a blazing charcoal stove. And that listener, quietly tilted her head and stared at my face with wide eyes.</p>
<p>I really don't like people staring at my face, so I said impatiently:</p>
<p>"Are my stories painted with colors?"</p>
<p>The listener blushed and said unhappily with a pout:</p>
<p>"Yes, that's why they are painted with colors!" She no longer looked at me. She just used a chopstick to stir the red-hot charcoal.</p>
<p>I put on my coat and quietly walked away.</p>
<p>Under the vast night sky where the wind was rolling the snow and the snow was rolling the wind, I took a deep breath of the clear and cold air. I ran in the white wilderness until my shoes were completely wet, and then I quietly crept back into the house.</p>
<p>The fire in the charcoal stove in the house had gone out; it seemed that those stories I had woven were still tangled in every corner of the house. However, that listener had left, leaving me a note:</p>
<p>--Kezhi, you said that the Japanese devils' aiming is better than ours, I don't believe it! You said that the Japanese devils can use terrain and terrain features, I don't think we can't do it either... Also, your set of weird temper, I don't think the Japanese devils can match you...</p>
<p>These words were written very vaguely and hastily, because they were written in pencil. Under the oil lamp, it took me a long time to make out the handwriting. I couldn't help but laugh to myself.</p>
<p>The bugle sounded, and many dark shadows were lined up on the pure white wilderness. Everyone was silent and solemn, without a bit of noise.</p>
<p>The forest was boasting a lonely and cold tune, the forest was shaking in the wind and clouds, the forest became old, it was draped in white hair, and the night sky gave it a sternness.</p>
<p>All the thatched huts were covered with pure white quilts, and there were no more little red fires inside. ... People were lined up on the pure white wilderness, and a skating-like slippery sound spread far away:</p>
<p>"One, two, three, four..."</p>
<p>On the empty and simple wilderness, the dark shadows of people turned into deep rose color in the snow...</p>
<p>"Stick out your chests, comrades, don't be afraid of the cold! Let's see if there's anything we forgot to bring? Comrades, think about whether the people's door panels are safe?... "</p>
<p>As soon as the sharp voice stopped, it was completely rolled away by the wind and snow. That listener of my story who had just stared wide-eyed! Like all the soldiers, she carried her bag, and she also had a "Browning" hanging on her belt. Seeing me, she said bluntly:</p>
<p>"It is not acceptable to underestimate or overestimate the × people!"</p>
<p>I didn't continue to say anything. I just gently told her: "Comrade, you know it's time for a night march." She lined up in the team.</p>
<p>Snowflakes that fell on our faces would melt before long. The wind dried the snow on our faces, so our faces had bursts of stinging pain.</p>
<p>Icicles had already hung on the treetops. The distant white snow-capped mountains seemed to be watching our group of guys, but I fantasized: I thought, if these huge mountains could sing one day...</p>
<p>So, spring - the projection of this bright and cheerful season - emerged in our rustling steps.</p>
<p>This is how we live.</p>
<h3>The Rushing Spring</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>"Glorious spring! May my heart be as new as yours, persistent. Upward, never-ending." - Lonell</p>
<p>Rushing spring, I love its powerful surging.</p>
<p>Not the black, stagnant, moldy green water, not the stagnant waves that are always so still in a narrow river, not as gentle, frivolous and weak as lake water, nor so flat, only spreading to both banks; it surges upward, with bursts of force, surging upward, constantly expanding, the air cannot suppress it, rushing, twisting like a swimming dragon, long days and months dragging through a gray hazy shadow, the sound of the spring plays a constant joyful song in the haze. In the haze, there are golden scales flashing.</p>
<p>There is no time to stop, the water will never dry up. In the mountain streams, in the open valleys, among the withered vines and chaotic leaves on the hillside, go and look for it, there will always be a surging, vast, emerald green ripple, in the deep depths of the secluded and endless small cliffs, hanging down a silver light like a training, shining the sun, and also mixed with the red flowers, small grasses and leaves in the mountains, the rushing waves, expressing the great joy of nature, a high-spirited song of life.</p>
<p>Exploring the endless source of the spring, what you feel is not disappointment, not vagueness, but you will thereby further expand the realm of life.</p>
<p>The sound is like saying that life is a torrent. Life should have a core, which is like saying that when we eat apples, pears, or walnuts, don't they all have a disgusting core? Exploring this core is no better than us casually tearing off a fruit peel, or smashing the hard shell of a dried fruit. Pursue the truth of that life, which is like saying, explore the final source of the spring.</p>
<p>But is it said that truth never exists? I know he has a core. "Pursue that truth."</p>
<p>I say, "I love that spring."</p>
<p>I remember the scenery I saw two years ago.</p>
<p>It was outside the mountain gate of Tiger Spring. New green was dotted on the hillside. A clear echo floated up, and the mountain mist brushed my eyebrows. My eyebrows spread out. In the cracks of the rocks, by the side of the earth cliff, there was a row of trees on the cliff, somewhat irregular, and somewhat chaotic. The shade of the trees covered the spring water, and the sound of gurgling, a continuous sound, pierced through the shade. Like a rope tied to the ear, the sound of the spring water followed me, climbing up the stone steps...</p>
<p>Also in Hangzhou, in the dark and silent camphor forest, going to the Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines, turning a few corners on the road, I entered a suddenly different realm. The surging contains implicit force, flowing through the narrow cliffs, a few spirals, impacting the mountain rocks, splashing open grains of water droplets. Looking back, I gradually walked away, looking at the white stone, I thought, when should it have started flowing? I calculated for him.</p>
<p>In cold and hot weather, he keeps moving, surging upwards, flowing downwards. Now I will calculate for him, and he is still flowing. Flowing into meandering streams, from the mountains and valleys; low and hidden among the withered branches and chaotic leaves, carrying red boats, and then flowing to the unknown. Maybe returning to the mountains and valleys?</p>
<p>When leaving Hangzhou, calculate for myself, it has been a full two years. The old spring water has already been flowed to who knows where, and even a small fountain made in my goldfish bowl at home has long been destroyed without a trace. Am I disappointed? No, I know that the spring water is still flowing, flowing every minute and every second, tireless and without rest.</p>
<p>Blocking it with stones, maybe you see the misfortune of the spring water stopping temporarily, but when the large amount of spring water bursts through the obstacles, you know that it is more powerful than before. Grasp the long-term life, the spring water will never die.</p>
<p>No one has ever subdued the spring water, we know that many stones have rotted away.</p>
<h3>Three Chapters Written at the Camp</h3>
<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>The Precious Sword</p>
<p>The precious sword on the wall is long, outside the window is the dreary drizzle, the books on the table, farewell! I want to abandon the dreams of poetry</p>
<p>and the fantasies of songs, go to the scorching hot camp, spit out the flames of resentment, often be with the precious sword, and imitate the laughter of the warriors.</p>
<p>The Camp</p>
<p>Last night's dew was cold; this morning's frost was heavy: the bugle is loudly raised, facing the distant mountains and forests. Shaking off the thin ice on my battle clothes, I shouted: "Distant parents! Your son is waiting for battle, his heart is full of hope."</p>
<p>The War Horse</p>
<p>My war horse follows me, as if it were a good friend, when I charge and am wounded, it stands upright beside me, its nose sniffing me, as if saying: Come on! Warrior, you have not yet repelled the enemy, you must charge again."</p>
<h3>From Chengdu to Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>6. National Heroes</p>
<p>They sleep on the floor in shifts. Only a handful of wheat straw is laid on the floor, and only a felt blanket is covered on top. How can they withstand this freezing weather! At night, coughing sounds rose everywhere. When some cough severely, I suspect they are simply spitting blood. Suffering from hunger and cold like this, it is natural to suffer from coughs. Many warriors, therefore, had to withdraw from the team before they even reached the front line. But there are countless people who value wealth and glory. Even during this period of resistance against Japan, their material enjoyment is as good as heaven. These comparisons lingered in my mind, and infinite emotion stirred my soul, and I lost sleep again that night.</p>
<p>The army got up at four o'clock in the morning, cleaned up the wheat straw, cleaned up once before eating, and after eating, the brothers all went out to the street to gather, then cleaned up again, and moved the moved bed boards and tables and chairs back to their original places, making them clear and clean. The newly trained army after the War of Resistance has also made progress.</p>
<p>I also got up at four o'clock, watched the brothers set off, checked my luggage, asked the porter to take it to the car, and set off from Ningqiang at nine o'clock, heading towards Hanzhong.</p>
<p>The distance from Chengdu to Ningqiang is 440 kilometers, and the distance from Ningqiang to Hanzhong is 125 kilometers. Not far out of Ningqiang County, it is climbing high mountains again. The mountain is called Wudingguan, one after another, towering into the clouds, and very dangerous. When descending the mountain, on the north side of a high peak, we turned sixteen bends on the winding mountain road before reaching the foot of the mountain. It is said that the Yunnan-Burma Road in Yunnan turns twenty-four bends in a mountain ridge before reaching the foot of the mountain, which is probably even higher and steeper than here. From the terrain here in Chongqing, it seems that the vicinity of Chongqing is the top point of the plateau, sloping down to the Yangtze River. After passing through the Rongchang border, it gradually slopes downwards. When it reaches Chengdu, it is a vast basin with no end in sight. After leaving Chengdu and entering the Jianyang County border, there are continuous hills, one layer higher than the other. Wudingguan is the highest point. After that, it gradually slopes downwards, sloping down to the Han River, and from Mian County onwards, it is the vast plain of Hanzhong.</p>
<p>At half past one in the afternoon, the car arrived at Wuhou Town. The town is old and dilapidated and is located next to the Han River. Outside the north gate of the town, there is the Wuhou Temple, which is built in the ancient temple style. Some of the brick and tile walls have already collapsed. On Mount Dingjun on the other side of the Han River, there is the tomb of Wuhou, where Zhuge Kongming, a hero of a generation, is sleeping. At this critical moment of the War of Resistance, lamenting the old traces of Zhuge Wuhou is also worthy of much sighing.</p>
<p>Wuhou Town used to be the seat of the Mian County Government. Years ago, because there were too many bandits, it was often surrounded and looted, so it was moved to Caiyuanzi, more than ten miles north of the town. From Ningqiang County to Mian County, there are many blockhouses along the way. According to a Northeastern comrade who is familiar with this road, there are three reasons why there are so many blockhouses: first, there are many bandits; second, the warlords used to occupy a few counties with a division commander stationed in them, fearing that they would be invaded by others, so they had to take defensive measures; third, the Red Army passed through the border years ago, competing for self-defense. Now, although the situation is completely different, the blockhouses are gradually showing signs of decay. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Indian Father and Son Bravely Fight Robbers Near Sai Ying Pun Police Station; Western-Clad Robber Escapes With Head Wound; Victim Shot in Jaw, Loses Over 30 Dollars</h3>
<p>At five o'clock yesterday morning, an Indian doctor's residence near the No. 7 Police Station in Sai Ying Pun was broken into by a robber, intending to rob. The victim discovered the robbery and bravely resisted. The father and son, along with a friend, fought together and used a kitchen knife to wound the robber. The robber also fired a gun, resulting in the victim being shot in the jaw and losing more than 30 dollars. When the police were called to investigate, the robber was nowhere to be found. Only a pistol was left behind and was picked up by the detectives. The details of the incident are recorded as above.</p>
<p>Incident Location: Near the Police Station</p>
<p>The incident occurred on the second floor of No. 284 Des Voeux Road West, which is close to the No. 7 Police Station. The robbers are rampant and dare to commit robbery there. The location is the residence of Indian ophthalmologist Sama Wenmou Mohammed. The old brother Lin Eye Hospital is located on the ground floor and was founded by Mohammed. The clinic on the ground floor is open to the public. At night, only a maid and a servant guard it. Mohammed's residence is on the second floor, where he lives with his son Anmo Deli. Mohammed also has a Chinese assistant named Chen Shitang, who assists in the clinic during the day and returns to his residence in the back street at night. The place where Chen lives is close to Mohammed's clinic on the second floor, and they can echo each other. The clinic's business is quite developed. Every day, many people come to the clinic to see their eyes, which attracts the attention of robbers.</p>
<p>Not Satisfied With Stealing 30 Dollars</p>
<p>Besides Mohammed and his son, there was also Mohammed's friend Heyazi sleeping in the building the night before, a total of two people. The incident occurred at 4:50 yesterday morning. At that time, everything was silent. Mohammed and his son were in their sleep. At that time, all the doors and windows in the room were locked. Suddenly, a robber broke into the building from an unknown place, first cut off the power lines in the building, and then groped around the walls in the room. Mohammed's coat was hung on the wall before going to bed, and there were more than 30 dollars in cash in his pocket, which was stolen. After stealing the cash, the robber pulled out a pistol and searched Mohammed's bed. Mohammed and his son had already been awakened by the sound of searching, but they saw the robber carrying a pistol and dared not move, pretending to be asleep. The robber thought that the Mohammed's had not woken up and pointed a gun at them and ordered them not to shout, threatening Mohammed to hand over the safe key.</p>
<p>Victim Wakes Up and Fights Back</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the robber's unpreparedness, Mohammed suddenly woke up and pushed the robber hard. His son Anmo Deli and his friend Li Yazi also woke up and fought back. The three of them fought the robber together, helping each other and tangling with each other. The robber, outnumbered, resisted while retreating into the kitchen. The three of them pursued him relentlessly. Mohammed saw the robber holding a pistol and about to fire, and quickly grabbed a kitchen knife and砍向the robber, wounding his head on the spot. The robber then fired four shots, and Mohammed was shot in the jaw. His son helped Mohammed back to bed while shouting for robbery. Only Heyazi was left fighting the robber. At that time, the robber's head had been wounded, and blood was dripping down, but he was still struggling desperately, arguing with Heyazi in the kitchen for a long time.</p>
<p>Robber Escapes After Being Wounded</p>
<p>At this time, Mohammed's assistant Chen Shitang was awakened in his residence by the noise and heard the shouts of robbery. He rushed over frantically. Li Yazi went to the stairs and opened the door to let him in. He initially thought that the robber had nowhere to escape in the 中. Unexpectedly, when he went out, the robber climbed out of the kitchen window and escaped after jumping down. Li Yazi and Chen Shitang returned to the kitchen and found that the robber had escaped. They went downstairs to chase him but were unable to catch up. They immediately reported the robbery to the No. 7 Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives, led by Bang, arrived at the scene to investigate. Nearby residents were all frightened. The police first sent the injured victim to Mary Hospital for treatment. They also investigated the scene of the incident and found a pistol left behind by the robber in the kitchen. There was still one bullet that had not been fired. They also found a pair of yellow leather shoes and socks at the place where the robber jumped out behind the house, and took them to the police station for investigation. The injured Indian Mohammed was not seriously injured. One of his teeth was knocked out. The bullet was removed from the hospital at 4 pm yesterday. There is no major problem. The robber who committed the robbery was about 30 years old and was wearing a suit. The police are strictly investigating and pursuing him.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Authorities Decide to Proceed with Deepening Aberdeen Bay to Allow Warships and Large Vessels to Dock, Dispatching Marine Police to Order the Relocation of Boats and Vessels</h3>
<p>Previously, the Hong Kong air defense authorities, considering the deep waters and steep mountains of Aberdeen Bay (i.e., Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau) suitable for docking warships and as a military port, planned to deepen the bay to facilitate the docking of warships and large vessels. There were widespread rumors that fishing boats and small vessels docked in the bay would be ordered to relocate, with Wong Chuk Hang in Aberdeen designated as the gathering place for them. Now, the air defense authorities believe that deepening the bay is imperative. However, the large and small vessels docked in the bay have not yet moved. A notice was sent to the Marine Police Station, which dispatched two marine police boats on the morning of the 17th to warn the vessels, ordering them to relocate to Wong Chuk Hang. Those who dared to disregard the order and refused to move would be arrested. On the 17th, after receiving the warning, the vessels successively relocated. The authorities will proceed with deepening the bay once all the large and small vessels have been relocated.</p>
<h3>New Territories Crude Industry Association Plans to Develop New Territories Agriculture; Implementation to Begin Step-by-Step Once Sufficient Funds Have Been Raised</h3>
<p>The New Territories Agriculture Association of Hong Kong, in order to improve the lives of farmers and enable Hong Kong's agricultural products to achieve self-sufficiency, has formulated a plan to develop New Territories agriculture. However, implementation will begin step-by-step only after raising the proposed credit loan fund of $20,000. According to the association's secretary, Mr. Tie Tesu, the association's activities have often been hindered due to a lack of regular income, and many plans have been forced to be shelved due to a lack of implementation funds. The association's proposed plan for developing New Territories rural areas includes increasing rural production, teaching farmers to adopt new methods of farming, and providing small rural credit loans to enable poor farmers to use the loans to purchase machinery and seeds, etc., to develop agriculture.</p>
<h3>Careless Storage Leads to Theft; A Maid Wins the Summer Lottery, $2,000 in Prize Money is Stolen; Paper Money Hidden Under the Bed Suddenly Disappears; Suspected to be the Work of a Friend of Another Maid</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Hong Kong lottery seems to have benefited maids the most. There have been several first prize winners, amounting to no less than two or three hundred thousand dollars. They jointly purchase tickets, each contributing only one dollar or several dimes. After winning, they divide the winnings equally, each receiving tens of thousands of dollars, which can be said to be extremely lucky. However, blessings do not always come without a catch. Careless storage leads to theft. Last year, after a group of maids won the first prize in the spring lottery, they returned to their hometown to thank the gods, only to encounter thieves and be robbed of everything. This time, after the summer lottery was drawn, the first prize of over $80,000 once again fell into the hands of a group of maids. One of the maids, named Zhu Yang (19 years old), lives in a rented bed space at 83 Xiang Street, Kowloon. This time, she received a share of the prize money totaling $2,333, all in hundred-dollar or ten-dollar bills. She put all of it in a rattan basket and stored it under her bed. Unexpectedly, when she woke up at one o'clock yesterday morning, she discovered that the basket had disappeared. Greatly alarmed, she knew that she had been robbed and loudly alerted the people in the house. There are a total of 20 men and women living together, and five of the maids also hold some shares of this first prize, receiving a considerable amount of prize money. After Wu Yang searched and found nothing, she went to the police station to report the case. Everyone in the house has now been summoned for questioning. As a result, no one has been detained. It is now suspected that a friend of one of the maids, who came to visit a few days ago, learned during the conversation that Zhu had a large sum of money stored away. Perhaps tempted by the sight of wealth, they secretly stole it. The person is now also missing. It is reported that Zhu also won about a thousand dollars in the spring lottery this year.</p>

<h3>Graduation Examination Measures for Registered Secondary Schools in Hong Kong; Superintendent Zhang Distributes Them to Each School for Preparation</h3>
<p>All registered secondary schools in Hong Kong, according to the order of the Guangdong Education Department, are scheduled to hold graduation examinations from June 26th to July 4th, as reported in previous news.

<p>11. The calculation method of the scores in each column of the graduation result summary table is as follows:</p>
<p>A. The sum of the scores of each semester of any subject is the "Total Semester Grade" of that subject.</p>
<p>B. Divide the "Total Semester Grade" of each subject by the number of semesters of that subject, which is the "Average Semester Grade" of that subject.</p>

<p>D. Multiply the "Graduation Examination Grade" of each subject by a decimal of four, i.e. (0.4), which is two-fifths of the "Graduation Examination Grade" of that subject.</p>
<p>E. The sum of "Three-Fifths of the Average Semester Grade" and "Two-Fifths of the Graduation Examination Grade" of each subject is the graduation grade of that subject, filled in the "Graduation Grade of Each Subject" column.</p>
<p>F. The sum of the "Graduation Grades of Each Subject" is the "Total Graduation Grade of Each Subject".</p>
<p>G. Divide the "Total Graduation Grade of Each Subject" by the number of subjects, which is the "Average Graduation Grade".</p>
<p>H. For students borrowing from war zones whose original school grades have not been submitted or are incomplete, the scores of each semester during the borrowing period can be added, or the scores of each semester of the original school that have been submitted can be added together, as the "Total Semester Grade". If a certain subject has several semester grades, the "Total Semester Grade" of that subject is divided by the number of semesters of that subject, as the "Average Semester Grade" of that subject. The rest is handled according to the above rules.</p>
<p>11. If a certain subject is required for the graduation examination, but the student borrowing from the area has changed the score of that subject, and it is included in the unpaid grade, the "Graduation Examination Grade" of that subject will be the "Graduation</p>
<p>12. Those with failing grades (i.e., those below 60 points) should be ordered to retake the failing subjects in the next session, or ordered to repeat a grade, in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>13. Those who pass the graduation examination may be issued a graduation certificate by the school, the format of which is as follows:</p>
<p>□□□ School Graduation Certificate, Examination No. □□, Student □□□, age □□, from □□ County, □□ Province, entered this school in □ year □ month □ grade, and graduated from the examination after completing the study period in June of this year. Graduates are approved to graduate. Because the graduation certificate cannot be presented for verification and issued for a while, it is ordered to issue a certificate first, so that it can be used to apply for further education. This certificate is specially issued for verification, Principal □□□.</p>
<p>14. The summary table of graduation results of each student shall be reported to the department within ten days after the examination.</p>
<p>15. For students borrowing from war zones (referring to those who have not been transferred to regular students), if the original school still exists, their graduation grades can be sent to the original school for comprehensive calculation and submission of the graduation result summary table to the department. If the original school has been closed or there are obstacles and cannot be delivered to the original school, the graduation result summary table shall be reported to the department by the school borrowing from it.</p>
<p>16. On the day after graduation, the supervisor and the principal shall jointly submit a report on the process to the department for review.</p>

They have all reported to the police station because they could not bear the pressure. Such incidents have been reported one after another. Now a mass fight has occurred in Tai Hang Village again. The police authorities are greatly shocked by this and believe that if it is not dealt with strictly, social tranquility will be greatly affected.</p>

<h3>Hainan Vocational School Held a Basic English Speech Contest Yesterday</h3>
<p>Excellent Results Achieved Using Eight Hundred and Fifty Basic Words</p>
<p>As the summer vacation is approaching and the seasons are changing, the vast student population has a desire to appreciate the scenery of the country and schools. The society is also very willing to know about these materials.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter took advantage of the invitation from Hainan Vocational School on Tai Po Road, Kowloon to attend the English speech contest of the Basic English Department of the school's Vocational Supplementary Class. I went to the school before 12 o'clock to visit. When I arrived, I saw that the competition had already started. An atmosphere of inquiry filled the classroom. The students all used the 850 basic words made by British O Gden to give speeches. After several months of training, they have achieved quite good results. The topics of the speeches of each competitor include "A Comparative View of Chinese and English Learning," "Determination to Win the Anti-Japanese War," "Health and Reading," etc., covering many aspects. Mr. Liu Weige, a famous English professor from John's University, was invited to preside over the evaluation. As a result, the male students Liang Hanji and Zhang Xianhong, and the female student Lu Ruizhen won the awards, and each received valuable book prizes. At the same time, Mr. Liu also gave a speech on "The Necessary Conditions for Learning Basic English," elaborating a lot on the methods and experience of learning English. The participants were all very excited for a while. According to Mr. Fang Xiaoyue, the principal of the school, "According to the experience of running this course for several months, I feel that this kind of basic English is a rational crash course, but scholars must also have considerable determination and diligence. The more crash courses, the more effort must be doubled.</p>
<p>The school will add a general junior high school department after the summer as a basis for entering the vocational high school of the school. Fang said, "Because I feel that junior high school students with a not very good foundation are entering a specialized vocational high school, and both teaching and teaching feel difficult. Therefore, a general junior high school department is now specially set up, hoping to be a good foundation stone. At the same time, a summer class is attached to tutor the students in this department, without charging extra fees."</p>
<p>Regarding the feelings of vocational schools, Fang also said, "Recently, the Third National Education Conference decided to increase the establishment of vocational schools for overseas Chinese education. This resolution is very valuable. As far as Hong Kong is concerned, the children of overseas Chinese feel difficult every year due to the problem of further education, and in this extraordinary period, people who are displaced and lose their studies and jobs are in serious trouble, all of which need practical relief. The so-called out-of-school people are those who have graduated from elementary school or junior high school, or who have such a considerable level that they do not want to spend more energy on ordinary subjects, and are willing to quickly obtain a specialized vocational skill, and are wandering on a fork in the road for this problem. The so-called unemployed people are those who are determined to engage in a profession, who are suffering from the lack of a skill, or who have been in school for many years, but are empty and have nothing to gain, and although they want to take a job, they suffer from the lack of tools to overcome it. These people, the former should enter vocational schools, and the latter should enter vocational supplementary classes. Recently, Mr. Gibson, an American vocational education expert, said in his book "American Extracurricular Vocational Guidance" that education is guidance rather than indoctrination. Not many students in society can go to school, and schools mostly focus on a large amount of homework indoctrination, and do not pay attention to individual skill guidance. This is wrong. What Gibson said about the situation in the United States is also a lesson for us to move towards this new trend in education. In addition, the famous academic system of Hu Anding of the Song Dynasty in the history of education in our country has a so-called 'governance' department, which is equivalent to the current vocational education. His spirit of learning and applying immediately and responding to world affairs is also a good model for education in the past. These are all things that vocational educators should pay attention to and strive for."</p>
<p>In addition, it is heard that the school's vocational supplementary class has added a Chinese shorthand course. Chinese shorthand is urgently needed in society. However, those who want to learn this technology are still suffering from no way to enter. Except for the Chinese shorthand class of the Shanghai China Vocational Education Association in the past, there is no such teaching. The school has recently hired Huang Chuanbin, the inventor of Chinese shorthand, as a professor. Huang's invention has been registered by the Ministry of Education and is completely in accordance with the national language standard. It is the most effective subject in Chinese shorthand. At the same time, those who are not familiar with the national language can also take this opportunity to learn the national language. It is said that many people in various social institutions should learn.</p>
<p>As for the school's vocational high school department, in addition to the journalism and agriculture departments being run as usual, many vocational supplementary classes have now been added, such as the family industry class, the accelerated agriculture class, the journalism supplementary class, the Chinese shorthand class, and the Chinese and English public document class, etc. Enrollment will be held at the same time in the coming days, and tuition fees will be reduced as much as possible, and many free places will be expanded to provide relief. The professors invited are all carefully selected experts with special experience.</p>

<h3>Student Relief Association: Girls' Student Corps Officially Established Yesterday; Inaugural Meeting Held at the YMCA; National Oath Ceremony Held Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Students from various girls' schools in Hong Kong, feeling the need for a closely-knit organization to promote women's rights, after a long period of preparation, the Girls' Student Corps of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association was finally established. Yesterday morning at eleven o'clock, the inaugural meeting and national oath ceremony were held in the auditorium of the YMCA. Ms. Wang Xiaoying, a leader in the women's movement, was invited to preside over the oath and give a speech. Several hundred guests and members of the Girls' Student Corps attended. The meeting's proceedings were as follows: (1) Formalities; (2) Chairman announced the reason for the meeting; (3) National Covenant Oath; (4) Speeches by representatives from various women's circles; (5) Awards for membership recruitment competition; (6) Singing; (7) Report on the organizational process; (8) Open speeches; (9) Election of officers; (10) Shouting slogans; (11) Adjournment. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Women's Circles Unite; Liberation Struggle</p>
<p>Chairman Liang Huanxiao began by announcing the reason for the meeting, stating briefly that in today's second stage of the all-out war of resistance, the establishment of the Girls' Student Corps has a significant meaning and mission. In the past, women's organizations lacked a solid organizational foundation. In particular, female students must bear the heavy responsibility of organizing lower-class women who have not received education. However, Hong Kong female students have a particularly strong feudal mindset due to their unique environment. Therefore, the most crucial tasks after the establishment of this Corps are to develop the women's movement, support student movements, and promote collective living. It is hoped that under the leadership of women's pioneers and teachers, efforts will be made for the nation and the country. There are many female students in Hong Kong, but only over two hundred have joined this Corps. In the future, continued efforts are needed to achieve greater results, and so on. After the speech, the national oath was taken, presided over by Ms. Wang Xiaoying and witnessed by Student Association Chairman Li Zhengyao. All members raised their right hands and recited the oath, the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Xiaoying's Speech: Hopes for the Girls' Student Corps</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, speeches began. Ms. Wang Xiaoying's speech stated briefly that she was extremely happy to see such a great women's organization established in Hong Kong. Based on her decades of experience in the women's movement, she would like to share with everyone that there are two weaknesses of those who have been engaged in the women's movement in the past: one is being too eager for leadership, but every women's organization cannot produce a large number of leaders, and bad practices arise from this; the other is not criticizing people's actions face to face, but whispering behind their backs, which will inevitably cause adverse effects. Therefore, today she has three hopes for the Girls' Student Corps: (1) After today's election of officers, those who are leaders should lead by example, avoid "showing off", and sincerely guide the public; (2) All members should treat public affairs as their own; (3) Understand the importance of their responsibilities and engage in practical work after the establishment, and not just talk empty words. In short, everyone should know that as citizens of the Republic of China, they should understand their due obligations and strive for the status of women with all their strength, and so on. Following this, Li Peiwo, representatives from the Women's Department of the Morning Mirror Society, representatives from the Women's Department of the Seamen's Union, and Li Zhengyao of the Student Relief Association spoke successively, expressing their gratification at the establishment of the Girls' Student Corps and hoping that it would initiate and promote the women's movement in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Awards for Membership Recruitment Competition; Li Xiuqiong Wins First Place</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, awards were given for the membership recruitment competition, which included two categories: number of members recruited and funds raised. In terms of the number of people recruited, the champion was Li Xiuqiong (Lizhe), the runner-up was He Xiuyun (Taoxiu), and the third place was He Zihuan (Zhengfeng). In terms of funds raised, the champion was Li Xiuhuan, the runner-up was He Xiuyun, and the third place was Liang Huanxiao. Ms. Wang Xiaoying presented the awards. Afterwards, the chorus team of the Four Women's Associations' Training Class performed, and the atmosphere became tense. Then, Lin Yuping, a member of the Girls' Student Corps, reported on the organizational process, followed by the election. Liang Huanxiao was elected as the corps leader, and Lin Yuping was elected as the deputy corps leader. Li Bing, He Xiuyun, Li Xiuqiong, Chen Biting, Mo Wanzhen, Mai Huizhen, Li Yanhua, Li Huiwen, Huang Hui and other nine people were elected as executive members of the general corps headquarters. Around 2 p.m., slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Feat of Beauty: Sailing Across the Atlantic; Sailboat Built in Hong Kong, Departure in Mid-November</h3>
<p>American navigator Ke Kenni arrived in Hong Kong two months ago, planning to build a sailboat in Hong Kong for the feat of crossing the Atlantic Ocean back to the United States. After Ke arrived in Hong Kong, the plan for the proposed sailboat had been finalized, and construction began at the Yakin Shipyard in Causeway Bay. The style of the sailboat built by Ke himself is similar in appearance to the famous Fuzhou sailboats of China, while the interior is similar to that of a modern yacht, measuring ninety-six feet in length, twenty-four feet in width, and one hundred and twenty tons in net weight. According to Ke, the ship has not yet been named and is expected to be completed by mid-November of this year. As for the future navigation plan, it is planned to first travel around the South China Sea for about seven months before arriving in Singapore. After a short stay in Singapore, it will sail past the Cape of Good Hope and the northeast coast of South America before heading to the Bahamas. Fifteen Chinese sailors have been hired, and in addition to himself and his nephew, there will be three or four American crew members. They will come to Hong Kong from the United States after the ship is built, it is said.</p>

<h3>Our Army Counterattacks Jiangmen and Xinhui; Major Battle About to Unfold; Once Charged into Huimin Gate and Engaged in Close Combat; Our Mechanized Units Arrive on the Xinhe Line</h3>
<p>(Changsha Express News) Our army on the Jiangmen, Xinhui, XinKai, JiangFo lines has launched a counterattack on Jiangmen and Xinhui. On the 16th, it once assaulted Xinhui City, and fighting continued on the 17th. Our morale is high, and we have won successive victories. The enemy is terrified. Currently, our large army is still moving to the front lines to participate in the battle. It is expected that a major battle will unfold in that area. The military situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Counterattack on Xinhui City; Fighting Continues</p>
<p>On the 17th, our army guarding the Shadi, Dayunshan, and Kuifengshan areas continued to attack the enemy positions. Our artillery also displayed great power, covering the attacking troops and constantly bombarding the enemy. The enemy in Xinhui City also fired artillery to resist stubbornly. Fighting continued. However, the enemy, feeling threatened by our artillery fire and the bravery of our troops, was extremely frightened and only dared to defend to the death, not daring to charge out to meet the battle. According to telegrams from the front, certain regiments of Deng Longguang's forces have arrived in Daze. On the 17th, they joined the front lines alongside Yang Jigan's Security Forces to advance towards Xinhui City. Large-scale fighting will continue to unfold. On the evening of the 17th, our rapid advance team charged into Huimin Gate and engaged in close combat with the enemy, holding out for twenty minutes and eliminating twenty or thirty people. However, due to being an isolated force, it was easily ambushed by the enemy and automatically withdrew.</p>
<p>Mechanized Units Deployed for Combat</p>
<p>The military authorities in the western region have long been determined to counterattack Jiangmen and Xinhui. It has been learned that some of our mechanized units have recently arrived on the Xinhe Road and are distributed in the Jinggen and Dugen areas, fully armed and ready to attack the enemy. It has been learned that the enemy has detected our army's renewed attack and is busy replenishing supplies, so the fighting on the Xinhe Road has been relatively quiet. Also, on the night of the 16th, our guerrillas lurking between Jiangmen and Xinhui carried out large-scale activities, destroying many sections of the Ningyang Gangzhou West Road and destroying several enemy telegraph poles, cutting off enemy military transportation and coordinating with our army's counterattack on the outer lines.</p>
<h3>Enemy Impersonates Our National Army; Harasses the Populace; Fourth War Zone Ordered to Strictly Guard Against</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express News) It has been reported to the Fourth War Zone Command by Commander Zhang of a certain army that the enemy in the Conghua Taipingchang area of northern Guangdong is wearing our military uniforms and carrying out activities everywhere. The insignia are marked with three kinds of characters: "Chinese Revolutionary Army," "Guangdong Revolutionary Army," and "National Revolutionary Army." It is feared that the ignorant masses will be deceived and fooled, which will greatly affect our army's reputation and operations. The War Zone Command issued a special notice to commanders of all levels and guerrilla commanders yesterday, ordering them to inform their soldiers and the populace to be aware and strictly guard against being misled by the enemy's poisonous scheme and to send personnel at any time to inform the military and civilians within their jurisdiction, exposing the enemy's conspiracies to prevent the enemy's scheme from succeeding.</p>
<h3>East River Guerrilla Warfare; New Developments Expected Soon; Xiang Hanping in Charge of Anti-Japanese War on the South Bank; Enemy Building Fortifications Along the Shilong Coast</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express News] Acting Commander Zhang formally ordered yesterday that the guerrilla columns of the Third and Fourth Districts be placed under the command of Deputy Commander and Director Xiang of the □ Group Army, with Chi Zhongkuan relieved of his concurrent post as commander of the East River South Bank Detachment. The Eighth Security Regiment, led by Deputy Commander Zhai Rongji, will continue its forward mission and remain under the command of Director Xiang. The operational areas have also been delineated, with the area below Heng of the East River being the responsibility of the Guerrilla Command Post and the north bank of the East River being under the command of the Sixty-sixth Army. However, for the convenience of operations, the Third Column of Luo Fengxiang's forces, currently on the north bank of the East River, will temporarily be placed under the nearby command of the Sixty-sixth Army and will still be the responsibility of Director Xiang.</p>
<p>Internal Appointments; Commanders at All Levels</p>
<p>The organization of the Guerrilla Command Post and its internal commanders have also been fully determined and appointed. The Command Post will be divided into three sections: Staff, Adjutant, and Quartermaster, and a Political Training Office. Zhang Wen will be the Chief of Staff, Yang Youmin will be the Chief of the Staff Section, Lin Zhuliang will be the Chief of the Adjutant Section, Huang Xianting will be the Chief of the Quartermaster Section, and Xiong Lue will be the Senior Advisor. Chen Xinrong and others will be appointed as Advisors. The personnel of the Political Training Office will be appointed separately, and it is stipulated that the salaries of the guerrilla columns of the One, Three, Four, and Six Districts will be distributed by the Command Post starting in June to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops in Shilong; Building Major Fortifications</p>
<p>On the 16th and 17th of this month, enemy military vehicles traveled back and forth on the GuanTai and GuanLong lines, all covered with black canvas tarpaulins. According to reports from the Strike Guerrilla Team, there are currently about 900 enemy troops in Shilong, with more than 400 enemy troops stationed in the town, including more than 100 cavalry, more than 100 artillery, and 200 infantry. Their unit numbers are Qiteng and Lai Tian. There are more than 300 enemy troops stationed in Xihu Jingshan, with more than 20 artillery, and their unit numbers are Nakajima and ZuoDao. In addition, there are 200 troops from the Kawada unit in the northeast. Five or sixty enemy speedboats and electric boats are patrolling the river, appearing to be ready to take advantage of the rising tides.</p>
<p>Enemy Compels Populace; To Be Driven by Them</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy troops in Guancheng are forcing our populace to participate in military service to be driven by them. In addition to conscripting villagers to organize fake self-defense teams, joint defense teams, and plainclothes pistol teams, they are also organizing a fake "Pacification Army," conscripting able-bodied men who have not yet escaped, with He as the captain appointed by the enemy. It has been learned that the fake army has recently been deserting due to the enemy's failure to pay military salaries. Makino, the enemy commander stationed in Guancheng, was furious and ordered He's dismissal, with Zhang appointed to succeed him. Also, the enemy chieftain recently forced Zhang, the head of the Dongguan fake security council, to forcibly conscript able-bodied men from various shops and escort them to Guangzhou for training. In recent days, more than a hundred people have been escorted by the enemy, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sanshui Enemy Rampages; Artillery Destroys Dozens of Villages in the Northern District; Thousands of Refugees Flee to Lubao</h3>
<p>[West River Decisive News] Lubao, which belongs to Sanshui County, is located on the Xiaobei River channel. Since the enemy army occupied various places in the southwest of Sanshui, it has been thinking of taking further advantage. Recently, the enemy army's Matsuno unit in the West River carried out so-called "sweeping operations" in order to "suppress" the guerrillas in the nearby villages. On the 12th and 13th of this month, they wantonly bombarded and harassed the villages, and dozens of villages, including Lucun, Yangmei, Nanbian, Baoyuetang Langang, and Xinliangting, were bombarded and destroyed. Among them, Lucun, Yangmei, and other six villages were particularly severely damaged and have become scorched earth. The villagers in these villages, realizing that the enemy army is so brutal, have fled to Lubao. According to statistics from the Lubao Police Station, about 1,300 refugees have entered in the past ten days. County Magistrate Tian Zhuseng has taken measures to provide relief to the refugees. Furthermore, Lubao is a place coveted by the enemy army, and enemy aircraft come to bomb it from time to time. In order to prevent the refugees from suffering losses from air raids and to prevent Chinese traitors from taking advantage of the opportunity to mingle with the enemy, the police station was specially ordered yesterday to cooperate with the garrison troops to strictly investigate and register all incoming refugees in order to prevent traitors from taking the opportunity to infiltrate and carry out activities, it is said.</p>
<h3>Han River Recedes</h3>
<p>Early Rice Losses in the Third District of Chaoyang Are Very Severe</p>
<p>[Chaoyang Express News] The Han River's water level rose sharply a few days ago, and the city's east-facing gates along the river were closed to prevent flooding. However, the water level has receded since the day before yesterday, and the east gate was opened yesterday to restore traffic. Also, the early rice crop in the third district was only about two weeks away from harvest, and the sudden flooding has caused extremely heavy losses, it is said.</p>
<h3>Earth-Shaking; Our Army Counterattacks Wenchang City; Perishing Together with the Enemy; Soldiers Prefer Death to Dishonor, Almost the Entire Battalion Dies Heroically; Wang Yi Requests Commendation of the Loyal Martyrs to Inspire Others</h3>
<p>(Xuwen Express News) In the late part of last month, our army on Qiongzhou Island launched a counterattack on the enemy and once recovered Wenchang City. Among them, there is a moving and tearful event that will be eternally remembered in the history of the nation. In that battle, more than 400 enemy troops were killed, while more than 300 of our attacking troops almost all died heroic deaths, with only 32 returning to the team. On the 25th of last month, a certain battalion of our security regiment received an order to attack. The entire army was invigorated and set off from Jiaji City at dusk and advanced towards Wenchang County overnight. Because of our familiarity with the local terrain, we detoured, and the enemy did not notice. Around 5 a.m. the next day, we had approached the outskirts of the city and were discovered by an enemy sentry, who fired at us. However, he was killed by us in an instant. Rushing forward, we first attacked the enemy camp at the county middle school. The enemy was caught off guard and hastily fought back. Our hand grenades rained down, and most of the more than 200 enemy soldiers were killed. Seeing that the great success had been achieved, we divided our forces and searched for the remaining enemy troops in the city. As soon as we encountered enemy troops, we stabbed them to death. However, soon enemy reinforcements arrived and surrounded the city on all sides. Because we were outnumbered, we used machine guns as vanguards to cover the infantry's breakout. Halfway through the assault, we were intercepted by the enemy. Under the command of Battalion Commander Liu, the company charged back and forth, killing many enemies. Then, the enemy gathered more and more troops and surrounded the company. Realizing that there were no reinforcements, Battalion Commander Liu desperately charged out, fighting and retreating, and only 32 people returned to the original location. All the others sacrificed their lives. More than 200 people who could not break out of the city launched repeated attacks, but all failed. Casualties were heavy. More than 80 people retreated to a high-rise building in the city to resist. The enemy tried to induce them to surrender, but the valiant soldiers were determined to dedicate their lives to the country and vowed not to submit. The enemy then launched an attack, and we defended ourselves by relying on the terrain. The fighting was fierce, lasting for five hours. Only 14 warriors remained on our side. Knowing that nothing could be done, but unwilling to be humiliated by the enemy, they all committed suicide by slitting their throats. At the end, they still shouted Long Live the Republic of China, and the enemy chieftain was moved. Wang Yi, the garrison commander of Qiongya, believes that the battalion's loyalty and courage in their duty are commendable, and the heroic deaths of the warriors are especially shocking to heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods. He has sent a telegram to Commander Zhang requesting that the personnel who contributed and the martyrs who died for the country be commended to encourage others, it is said.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Public Baseball Game; South China Mr. Loses After Winning; You Bei Defeats Hong Kong and Sets a Scoring Record</h3>
<p>Yesterday, under the scorching sun and oppressive heat, two public baseball games were held as scheduled. In the first game, South China Club unfortunately lost to the Western Club by a score of 5 to 10. The reason for South China's defeat was that the coordination was not close enough, and Ye Beihua and Zhu Guolun performed poorly. However, catcher He Xiancheng was very skilled, and pitcher Zheng Kangyong lacked experience. However, their most fatal injury was that they conceded six points in the third inning. However, although South China lost this battle, there are still issues. It is said that South China will appeal to the Federation. This issue occurred in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>In the fourth inning, when South China was on the offensive, it was Situ Bi's turn to bat and he got a "free first base." He Xiancheng continued to get on base. When Situ Bi stole third base, the pitcher threw the ball to the third baseman to stop him. The umpire Liu Guozhang ruled that Situ Bi had safely reached the base, but the chief umpire, De Jili Shi, said that Situ Bi would be killed and ruled him out. South China protested in vain and claimed to appeal. South China was disheartened by this setback and had no intention of fighting. Huang Yaodong and Wu Bangzhen were killed successively, and this inning collapsed.</p>
<p>In the fifth inning, Tang Rongguang first got "free in innings" and took advantage of Zhu Guolun's "safe hit" to advance to second base. Zheng Kangyong swung his bat with great power, got a safe hit, sent Tang Rongguang back to home base, and scored one point. Pala Ci even threw "four balls" in a row, letting Chen Yutian board first base. At this time, Zhu, Zheng, and Chen occupied third, second, and first base respectively, forming a "full base" advantage. When Ye Beihua came to bat, he hit a high fly ball. Zhu, Zheng, and Chen risked running the bases. Unexpectedly, the high fly ball was caught by Birodu, who first eliminated Ye Beihua, then threw to first base to kill Yutian. Yaluweili threw the ball to the catcher and intercepted Zhu Guolun, resulting in a "triple play." South China then left the field dejectedly. Western Club scored four points in the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings, plus six points in the third inning, for a total of ten points. South China only scored five points in the entire game and was defeated.</p>
<p>In the second game, You Bei played against Hong Kong Club. There was not much to see. Hong Kong Club made a lot of mistakes, and both offense and defense were improper, resulting in a one-sided game. You Bei team finally won by 23 to 0. It can be said that they broke the scoring record for baseball in Hong Kong over the years. The results of yesterday's games are recorded below.</p>

<h3>From Ancient Greece to the Various Aspects of the Olympic Games</h3>
<p>— Ding Lao</p>
<p>A Precious History of Sports</p>
<p>(2) Daius of Sparta, a three-time winner of the games, was arrested for committing the great crime of rebellion, but the citizens voted to spare him from the death penalty.</p>
<p>(3) Callias, because he won first place in the horse race and the excellent performance of his fourth horse finishing second, was ranked equal to those who restored the freedom of the country.</p>
<p>(4) An old man named Dagosas had two sons who both won victories. He was so overjoyed that he died of happiness.</p>
<p>Criticism of Greek Sports</p>
<p>First, regarding the accusations of philosophers against the winners of the games, as mentioned above, the winners of the Olympic Games could enjoy such glory and be so loved by the people, but this also aroused the doubts of philosophers. Because in Greece during the heyday, there was freedom of speech, and the spirit of opinion was critical of the games. The most fair critique was from the philosopher (Xenophanbe) 570-480BC, who was born in Colophon in Asia Minor. He criticized the gods generally believed in at the time without any scruples. He believed that the thoughts of gods were definitely not like those of humans, and that the winners of the games were not incarnations of gods. It was absolutely impossible to know in advance who would win. He himself had rich experience in sports and was not just standing by and talking nonsense. He only felt that this blindly enthusiastic thought of sports contained dangerous elements, so he said, "She feels that being excellent in sports is not the happiness of life. The reason why humans are superior to dogs and horses lies in the reputation gained from intelligence. Otherwise, it is just a traditional and foolish habit. For example, being good at boxing, wrestling, pentathlon (the pentathlon at that time was running, wrestling, jumping, javelin throwing, and discus throwing), and running fast may be a matter of reputation, but no country has become strong because of this. Winners may satisfy the desires of the citizens, but there is no fact that the citizens have benefited from it." Of course, no one paid attention to him in the crowd who were enthusiastic about sports. A hundred years later, Curipidei influenced him, "Sparta promoted national defense and rewarded sports, which cannot be regarded as active promotion of physical education." At this time, the Greek games were in a golden age of prosperity, with no professional athletes or professional disputes. Philosophers had keen senses and sharp observations, and faintly discovered the seeds of decline lurking in the shadow of the competition, and sowed the seeds of national demise.</p>
<p>Second: Regarding the results of the games, the Greek records are untrustworthy, because they proved that the excellence of the athletes was a manifestation of divine power, and deliberately boasted to their conquered slaves to make them tremble and dare not betray. For example, Phaylles' long jump was eighteen meters, Skylliao's diving record was five kilometers, and even Sparta's Fobas traveled a thousand miles a day, and the strong Milar killed a cow with one punch at the age of four, which became a myth.</p>
<p>Third: Regarding the theory of physical education; the multitude of sports equipment now is something that the Greeks could not have dreamed of. The same is true for the research of theory. For example, the physiologist Platon, who was known as a great scholar at the time, only wrote casually based on his feelings. Even Aristatles, who was called the father of science, said that muscles were only materials filled between bones and should not be regarded as motor functions. In short, ancient Greek physical education was only due to the grace of natural geography, and it was an activity of the childhood of mankind. Therefore, it only had experience but no scientific research, and its implementation was only limited to a small number of nobles and not popularized to the majority of the people. Once the nobility declined, physical education also ended.</p>
