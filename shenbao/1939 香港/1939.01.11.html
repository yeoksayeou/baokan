<p>社評</p>
<h3>英相聘問羅馬</h3>
<p>英首相張伯倫偕外相哈里法克斯訪問羅馬之舉，早於去年九月杪明興協定成立時，卽已有所决定。以張氏古稀之年，猶不惜僕僕風塵，其努力於和平的締造，誠堪欽佩，惟與侵略國妥協，而欲謀世界的局勢澄淸，事實恐將適得其反。猶憶捷德糾紛解决之時，張伯倫曾獲得「和平使者」的美名，而實際上歐洲的危機依然隱伏如故，所謂和平，只是一時苟安的局面而已！雖然如此，仍不能挫這位「和平使者」的勇氣，故此次羅馬之行，决非尋常酬酢可比，其用意的重大可知，而值得注意者約有下列數點：</p>
<p>一，英意關係的調整。自一九三五年意阿戰爭發生後，英國因支持國聯對意的制裁决議案，與意大利的關係即日趨於惡化，意大利以財政困難，尤其是自併吞阿比西尼亞之後，一面因戰爭中消耗過大，一面則欲開發其所征服的領土，在在需欵，除向英舉債之外，別無良法，所以墨索里尼雖慣用恫嚇敲詐的政策，然而始終總抱着媚英抑法的態度，蓋非如此，則不能挽救其山窮水盡的財政危機。惟年來墨索里尼銳意經營，志在奪得地中海霸權，以控制英法對東方的交通路綫，尤其是英國與印度及澳洲的聯絡，此種企圖使英國時時感到不安。當明興四强會議之時，張伯倫可以慷慨地犧牲捷克，而一九三五年之所以極力反對意大利侵略阿比西尼亞者，其原因就是在此。其次英國在菲洲擁有廣袤的殖民地，在東菲方面的領土大半與阿比西尼亞毗連，一旦意大利在阿國的勢力穩定，則英國的殖民地時時都有被侵略的可能，因爲墨索里尼的主要政策乃在恢復古羅馬帝國的光榮，而其思想乃以戰爭和侵略做出發點，張伯倫此次羅馬之行，當在試探墨索里尼的眞正意向何在，然後謀英意關係的調整，而從事地中海問題及英意菲洲領土界務問題等的談判。</p>
<p>二，法意問題。德捷糾紛解决之後，墨索里尼認爲英法當局今日所採取的外交政策乃在息事寧人，只要能使歐局澄淸，則不惜任何妥協甚至犧牲，加以明興協定成立後，法國因失去了協商國的擁護，而法蘇協定已成具文，其國際地位陷於孤立，因此才惹起十一月三十日意議會中對法要求領土的呼聲，且於去年十二月下旬單方宣告廢止一九三五年一月所締結的羅馬協定。最近兩個月來法意間的關係總在一緊一弛之中。就目前的情形而論，意大利當然沒有對外作戰的能力，但法西斯蒂國家既以侵略爲其唯一的國策，德國如是，日本如是，意大利亦何能例外？到了最後，目的不能達到，也許不惜胃大險，藉武力以求一逞，也說不定。在法國方面，民氣如是激烈，法總理達拉第且業經屢次表示法國爲和平計，故不惜對各國妥協，然若誤認此爲法國政策的軟弱，則實犯重大錯誤。本月六日他在阿爾及爾總督招待席上曾發表演說畧稱：法國保護其各處屬地的决心，始終不淪，……法國的版圖由佛蘭德平原起至剛果河兩岸止，而其勢力復伸展至亞洲。如遇必要時，法國當不辭一戰，以維護自由及世界各民族的自由，凡欲破壞法蘭西完整，必遭吾人堅强的抵抗云云。觀此，則可知道意大利所提出的領土要求，法國必無讓步的可能。法意今日的危機不能解决，則歐洲局勢的綏靖便無法實現。此次張伯倫既不惜長途跋涉之勞，意大利且予以熱烈之歡迎，亦正欲藉其作調人，以達到其無厭的企圖，雖然法國表示不要英國干涉，而調解法意衝突，仍是張氏訪意的主要任務之一，則無疑義；我們觀於張伯倫於赴羅馬途中，先至巴黎與達拉第晤談，則可知其用意乃在試探法國政府的態度如何，以爲調解的準備。</p>
<p>三，不干涉西班牙內戰。西班牙內戰能延長至兩年以上，乃意德的支撑叛軍有以致之，尤以意大利一面欲在西國領土內得一根據地，以威脅法國，一面則由此而增强其控制地中海的力量，故推翻西班牙共和政府，是他的重大陰謀。明興會議時，張伯倫與墨索里尼關於撤退西班牙志願軍曾經成立諒解。然事後意大利並不履行諾言，是時雖由西國撤退數千志願兵，事實上這些志願兵均爲受傷殘廢而失却作戰力的。據上月下旬巴黎所傳的消息稱，墨索里尼嗾使西叛軍於十二月十五日開始總攻，並由意國空軍助戰，以便於張伯倫抵羅馬之日，造成一個「西班牙的摡成事實」。觀此，則西班牙的解决，恐將遭遇甚大的困難。</p>
<p>上述三點如不能解决，則新四强會議便沒有舉行的可能。據吾人的觀察，張伯倫致力和平的苦心固可佩服，然事事遷就極權國家，恐其影響所及，只有加重和平的威脅而已。明興協定的結果，在東歐加速了希特勒的侵略野心，南歐財有墨索里尼對法國領土的貺覦，在東方則引起日本軍閥進攻華南，而給予香港以嚴重的威脅。正本淸源，才是建立和平的唯一的好辦法，這點諒英國的賢明執政者。當早已注意到吧！</p>

<h3>朝鮮義勇隊在中國</h3>
<p>— 羽</p>
<p>【本報重麼特　航訊】抗戰以後、國際人十熱烈的同情、以及實際的援助已經成爲制×人死命的一個偉大的力量、從國際友人來華參與戰地、作的方面來說、就是更顯明的事實、朝鮮民族因爲飽受×人殘酷的待遇、對×人的認識、尤爲深刻而且敏感、所以對我們抗戰的同情與援助、也特別熱烈、在抗戰中長成的朝鮮義勇隊、晉功牌上是、有他過去不可磨滅的功蹟的、目前抗戰進至第二期的階段、發動×人後方的廣大游擊戰、是我們今後在軍事上主要的戰略、朝鮮義勇隊就是負了這一戰略施行上的一部份的責任、記者特前去訪問朝鮮民族革命黨宣傳處的揚民山先生、請他告訴該義勇軍的最近情形、他說、</p>
<p>「朝鮮義勇隊是屬於朝鮮民族革命黨的、成立在去年變十節、負該隊完全資任的、就是朝鮮民族革命黨的總書記金若山先生、」</p>
<p>接着、他講到該隊的組織和工作、「加入這個義勇隊的、多數是朝鮮民族革命黨員、而負各部份領導任務的、則多是朝鮮有革命歷史或參加過一九二六年中國北伐戰爭的、或曾在中國留舉受過軍事訓練、參與過中國革命的人物、或者在本國領導過學生運動、做過不少較爲光榮事業的人、因此、在領導方面是比較健全的、</p>
<p>「他們現時還未和×人直接發生過戰鬥、他們目前的任務是分爲兩部、一部是對國內的、一部是對國外的、對其國內是號召和勸員全朝鮮民族來擁護和援助中國的抗戰、在中國抗戰期中、爭取自己國內的自由與獨立、對中國呢、即是向各戰區的中國人民宣傳、把自己身爲亡國奴的一切痛苦、告訴給中國人民、把日本帝國主義者在其宰割下的弱小民族所表露出來的眞面目、告訴</p>
<p>給中國人民、如强他們抗戰的勇氣、以他們一年餘來的經騐看來、他們所得到的効果、比其他戰地服務團在宜傳方面所獲得的、還要大些</p>
<p>「其次、他們便煽動×兵反戰、他們因了語言的便利、這一工作做得很好、』</p>
<p>他列舉了好幾處×軍反戰是受了朝鮮義與隊煽動的結果的事實來、接着、他又說了」過去這一年多、中國鄱是用的正面戰、所以他們沒有盡到義勇隊的任務、今後、隨着中國戰略的轉變、他們將施展他們在伊籐傳文時代、羲兵運動的精神、來和×人作殊死戰、因爲中國的抗戰、不單在求中華民族的解放、也是在爲朝鮮同胞求自由、』</p>
<p>「朝鮮義勇隊各隊員的家屬現在什麼地方呢？記者深恐×人惡毒的爪牙會搜得他們無辜的妻兒、</p>
<p>他答：「都在這裏」、</p>
<p>『那來靠什麼生活呢？』</p>
<p>『現時由朝鮮民族革命黨維持、不過這不是久遠之計、我們正在計劃開闢生產的事業、很希望中國各實業家、　業家、出來帮助我們！』</p>
<p>（一月七日寄）</p>
<h3>穿過了×區</h3>
<p>— 淡紅</p>
<p>【戰地速寫】在後方工作慣了的同志們、一聽到了『×區』大家總覺若一些莫明的凜懼、覺得這是一個不可輕易冒險去的地方、好像到了這裏、我們處處說不定要碰到什麼危險似的、可是我們從晉西南×縣一直到了太原附近的河口、……穿過了×區、又到達了我們抗日游擊隊佔據地的河口、我們沿河的所見所聞、只有對我們在抗戰上增加了多多的認識、</p>
<p>民眾對於抗戰、已經加深了認識、對於戰覺得是一件很平常的事、就以永和、大寧、陽縣而論、這幾個城市大半已被日×焚燒、但奇異的是一般民眾、並不以爲是怎麼了不起的、却很愉快的過着抗戰時期的生活、×人今天來到就帶領了父母妻子、很迅速的去躱藏了、等到×人去後、老百姓們很快的搬向去、依然過着很平常的生活、雖說×人已把商店房屋燒盡了、但在殘餘的台階上、商人很自然的擺開了什物的　了、老白姓們仍然牽着牛耕着田、我們在×區裏、武裝齊全的穿過去、從早晨到夜晚看不到幾個×人、</p>
<p>過了淸源高白鎮二三里的地方、橫在面前的是一條蜿的太汾公路、道是×人沿太原到汾陽的一條大道、爲了軍事交通上的重要、與預防我游擊　的破壞、日×　常派有重兵往來巡視、所以一般人民覺得太汾公路是不易衝過的、我們武裝同志百餘人、很從容的走到公路附近的當兒、大家興奮到了極點、檢彈都準備好了、想要和×人拚命、這×人的坦克車忽然風馳電掣的駛來、但×兵看到了我們準備斯殺的整齊隊伍、恐怕我們去襲擊他們、趕快把裝甲車倒開囘去、</p>
<p>另有一次我們快要過平汾支線的時候、剛走到一佃村落的附近、巳到深夜時分、人馬雜沓的會音引得村犬吼吠起來、×人距離我們不過半里之遠、同時也發覺了探照燈向我們猛烈的探索、當時我們的面部和衣服上、如月光侵射的明亮、可是×人爲了怕我們襲擊的緣故、終於遠遠的跑了、</p>
<p>×人駛開汽車、坦克車、裝甲車等以運輪給養和子彈、不得不往來於太汾公路、一路的兩旁、完全是崇山峻嶺、×人從這裏經過、只要我們的部隊埋伏在山頂上、或是靑紗帳裏、很痛快的能使×人遭受相當的損失、所以我們工人武裝自衛部隊時常潛伏在公路兩旁襲擊×人、結果×人的汽車都被焚毀、×人的呢子外衣、水皮鞋、戰馬、給養、罐頭等等都成了我們的勝利品了、</p>
<p>在×區專、偽府的命令公文、着實繁多、但是命令到了各個鄉村、各里長鄉長却不理會它、雖然×人的漢奸走狗等等無恥分子也曾極力的加以催促恐嚇種植手段、但結果也只有敷衍了事而已、實際上偽組織來的一切實施、從沒有完全的執行過、但另外的一面沿途民眾對於我們的熱誠與擁護、正充分的表現了他們嫉恨仇×與愛護砠國的心理、我們所過一地、男女老少都齊集在街道旁來園觀着、沒有牛點兒的畏懼、他們在忙亂地給我們燒水、燒飯、買東西、還要把家裏所有的水果、棗子等零食、親熱地分給我們、希望我們都食個乾凈、但是今天假如×人到了、老百姓就一齊逃去、把食糧用物也一齊搬走了、</p>
<p>在×人佔領的城市附近、雖然還在我們的政權領導下、但終於免不了邇受×人的騒擾與掠奪、以故這些地方的村民、無時無刻不在切盼我們游擊隊的釗達與保護的、如果遇到民業的部隊到達了或經過了這個村莊、民眾就自動的替我們軍隊放了哨、在村外假使瞭望見×人到來、就趕快回到村裏報告、指使我們怎樣逃走、避免和×人作無謂的衝突、以致意外的損失、此外我游擊隊混入在×人已佔領的區域內伯察或宣傳時、雖然和×人同在一個村莊也决沒有被×人發覺的危險、甚至×人居住了東面的一所房子、我們就住到西面的院子裏、除老百姓外、×我兩方都被它蒙在鼓裏互相不知的、軍民合作的情形已經到了這地步、</p>
<p>沿途走過了六七個縣城、一種可喜的現象常常會使我們興奮鼓舞的、我們看見了百姓們仇恨××的心理滿街滿璧的流露着、有時會直然指出各地××的罪狀、這是使人多麼興奮的事啊！</p>
<p>我們深信×區呻吟摩托着的民眾、更是我抗×隊伍中的主要部分、我們絕不能忽略了它們抗×的積極性、更不能放過了×區內的民運工作、惟有加强爭取×區內的民眾工作、才能揭破×人的種種陰謀、才能完成我游擊戰略的初步勝利、</p>

<h3>近衛內閣瓦解與　平沼內閣的展望　（續昨第七版）</h3>
<p>— 李萬居</p>
<p>對中國的　略政策·不更變，—八個月的戰爭的教訓。　仍未打醒日本軍閥的「速戰速决」的　夢·單第一期第一階段至第三階段·它每次都是採大迂迦的包圍戰略，以冀將我軍的主力消滅，非如此，戰事無從結束，征服中國的企圖無由實現。戰車延長一日·刻　困難必更增加，泥淖愈陷愈深，崩淸的到臨則愈速事故平沼組閣後的日本軍事行動必將史加緊張，激烈和殘酷，這是我們所不可不注意的。然而在信時，對侵略加緊淮行的軍事。淮行妥協，收買我國的認識不淸和意志動搖的份子等項工作仍不會停止。因爲非講和不能得到其所　想的戰果，而且也無以挽救其國內已經在爆發中的危機。我們澈底認淸，，日本軍閥何以　於要和呢？因爲它那　紙老虎已經嚇不了人，已經被戳穿了。所以我們務須苦苦　去，切不可上它的當，使子子孫孫受無窮的痛苦一</p>
<p>平沼是佃司法官出身的人，眼光狹小。能有什麼作爲，已可概見。據我們的推測。當　所欲推進者只有上面所述的較　四大端。惟日本目前在內政和外交上所遭遇的困難。　非有回天能力的偉大政治家實　無法克服，新內閣所無法越的難關約有下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）戰爭規模擴大。戰綫延長兵　和軍費必隨　增加，就日本的現狀而　財力　經枯竭、而　力　到　將近無兵可調的險竟。（二）國　壓力與日俱增，內改改革　艱於實現，生意指數．自去年八月以後　已減退，隨着戰事的延長，此後萎縮必中加嗎害。（三）日本民眾的曾困乃係　略戰所釀成。並非受外國的壓迫所致，是以日本大眾所要求的乃是停戰並改革內政。（四）法西斯政權在大多數的日本赤貧階級看來只是黑暗，並非光明，且會引起國際間如美同蘇聯的婊視厭惡，結果　容易促成其內部革命的爆發。</p>
<p>要而曾之，平沼內閣既如是孱弱，而欲　解决日本當前的許多難題。我　可斷定其必步步荊棘。陷於束手無法的地步，所以不久也許　會　事改組，但　改組也未必能加張它　力量，未必能延長它的命運和免回日本政治的崩潰—（完）</p>

<h3>二期抗戰中的雲南</h3>
<p>〔昆明特約　訊〕抗戰已轉入了第二期，雲南己成爲持久抗戰交通的樞紐，滇緬公路替代了　漢路的國　運輸，西　兩大勸詠——滇緬，敘昆兩鐵路已於南年—二月二十五日舉行　破土禮、預期本年三月底完成，定綫工作，邊省的雲去，已從抗戰中生長起來了，爰將　省對于二期抗戰中的準備，分誌如下。</p>
<p>兵源補充</p>
<p>聲當局爲抗戰兵源的補充，　會組織成立了一個團務督練處，統調壯丁訓練事宜，並于若干縣份割設　計劃征督練分處，就近騐收　練，茲爲參加二期抗戰起見，中龍主席論飭該團務處，先行征調壯　八千名二集中某　，交由安師長騐收限期出發，命令甫下，應征健兒踴躍立　，而這八千健兒的來源，計大關縣應征二百名，鹽律縣三百名，成信縣三百名一·鎭雄縣一千三百名，　良縣六百名，（屬第一督練分處）廣南縣應征九百名，邱北縣二百名，硯山縣一五名一·西時縣四百五十名，文山縣四百名一·（屬第六督練分處）蒙自縣應征四百五十名，簡舊縣　百五，名，開遠縣三百名，建水縣五百五十名，曲溪縣一百名，石屏縣四百名，通海縣一百名；　西縣一百名，華寧縣二百名一，蛾山縣一百名，（屬第二督練分處一）江縣應征一百五十　；（屬第七督練分處）現在已經集中訓練，一分處所轄的大關等縣壯丁三千名，共　爲壯丁　一，第二，第三，三大隊，第六分處所轄的　南等縣壯—二千名。　爲　四，第五，兩大隊，第二分處　第七分　所轄的蒙自的期內，當可交由安帥長騐收出　了。</p>
<p>幹部訓練</p>
<p>本省爲了充實各項幹部　員，嚴密黨政　的機　，由省府委托軍分校負責辦軍團警黨政各項幹部人呂訓練，成立了戰時幹部人員訓練總隊，內分四大隊，第一大隊　官訓練班，中綏署登記，滇黔兩省的閒散軍官，并參入淸丈人員一部，第二大隊是戰鬥幹部的　士訓練　，由　務督練處袖　各所屬幹部，並考選當地曾受軍訓的高中學生，第三大隊是警官訓練班，第四大隊是黨務行政人員軍事飄練班，各大隊修　時間，長短難是各別，可是他的訓練原則，對象就是持久戰、</p>
<p>富源待發</p>
<p>自從中央　委會的　西邊　考察團由重慶來　、沿　湞　公路出發考查歸來後，認爲自然所賦的邊地各種絛件，都是至善至美山川的秀體，氣象的雄偉，氣候的温和，農出的肥美，農作物如稻米、棉化、茶業，烟草，果類等、都可以大規，的種值，蓄牧　桑，亦易發展，礦藏於北所在多有，目前該處土人用幼稚的技術最少的勞力，得來的報酬和享受，達在內地農民聯主足之餘，此種絕對富庶之區域的現在仍是人烟稀少，際此救濟難民移　之秋，該地確是西南的樂土。</p>
<p>有多行人認爲滇西邊地的陣碍，就是「烟瘴』和「擺夷』經　團玫察歸來，認　以上兩問題，都可以迎　而解、所謂「烟瘴』、據說並不如傳聞之甚，祇　衛生設備稍加注意，瘴氣的消滅是絕對不難。至所稱的〔擺夷』民挨、他的秉性亦訓良，教化甚易，即號稱慄悍的山頭民族，如政府方面能够教導有方，不特可資爲開發的大帮助，還可訓練成爲一個英勇抗戰健兒，此外交通運輸又得滇緬公路之使、力加經營、當可化漳爲樂土了。本省「邊經濟　查　」將　賑委會考查團之後、出發西南各縣了。它的組織是由省府經濟　問　磨專集資組成，出發期預算　個月、工作範圍在迤西迤南各縣　查農村經濟，天然富　、并研究增加生產的方法，和投資辦理實業的方案、從　查研究所得的結果、以備將來　献政作施政的方針，并公諸社會各界以　前在投資興　實業</p>
<p>續之、滇省已從抗戰中十長了起來，爲　持久戰中加强「物力」，那麼滇西邊地或　是滇西的富　。是　要趕速建設、（萬山、元月四日）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>注視陳璧君的活動</h3>
<p>汪兆銘太太陳望君到港的消息，本報最先發裏。現在已經各力証實。過去汪氏數次策動政變，陳壁君都負有重大的責任，早已成爲公開的秘密。這次汪氏叛離祖國，行踪詭秘，而陳璧君乃四處奔赤活動，我們不能不喚起各關係方面的警惕和注意。此外，教們願忠告陳璧君者，你曾經救過汪氏的生命，只不過是汪家一家的功臣，而把汪氏的集中斷定了。却成爲中國全國的罪人！我們縱不敢奢望你學學同業各界要人們的榜樣，最低限度亦希望你保全自己丈夫最低限度的「晚節』，好好侍奉他到國外去養「病」吧！</p>
<h3>到×人營壘中爭取友軍</h3>
<p>我國抗戰勝利的主要條件，是（一）中國的進步，（二）×人的困難，（三）國際的援助。我們力爭自己政治軍事的進步和國際援助的成功，同時也加重了×人的困難，不過還不能忘記到×人營壘中爭取反對×人的友軍！</p>
<p>有些人認爲到×人營壘中去爭取友軍，完全是一種幻想；其實這種說法徒然顯得自己不明白這次中日戰爭的意義而已。因爲這次日本侵華戰爭，一面固然是中華全民族絕對對立的戰爭，一面也是和全日本人民及台灣人民利益對立的戰爭；我們抗戰固然是中國自求解放的戰爭，同時又是反法西斯的戰爭，必然帮助日本及台鮮人民從法西斯壓榨—解放出來。</p>
<p>現在日本侵略者正在加緊走向法西斯專欄的步驛·侵略帥部和人民的對此亦正在更加嚴重，我們到×人營壘中爭取友軍的時機，正在一天天成熟着。我們要如緊爭取偽軍反正爭取×軍叛降的工作！</p>
<h3>東南歐形勢的發展</h3>
<p>— （本報倫敦特約通訊）叔</p>
<p>東南歐形勢的發展，對於全世界甚至隊洲整個的局勢，是不發生重大作用的，它的作用範圍，主要的是在於歐洲各强間的關係上，未來的張伯倫，莫索里尼間的羅馬談話，那裏而。據現在所知，東南歐是最主要的項目之一，因而，在這羅馬談話的前夜，記者想來，有將它最近形勢的發展，約略加以報告的必要。這裏所謂「東南歐」是指着巴齣幹島的五個國家，加上波蘭，士耳其歐洲部份，匈牙利，等國而言。</p>
<p>在我們說東南歐最近形勢發展的時候，第一個引起我們注意的，是慕尼黑會議後，法國從東南歐舞台上的暫時退塲；其次引起我們件意的，是德國勢力有聲有色的伸入；第三，是意大利的焦燥與不安；再其次，是英國的活動，最後，當是蘇俄的在該方面最近外交上的攻勢，雖然，對於未來的具體結果，現在還不知道，但像目前這種形勢發展的傾向那可能的重大結果却是：（一）德國完全勝利的塲台，是完全成爲她的附庸；（二）意大利完全勝利的塲合，是除去阿爾巴尼亞仍然保持向來的附庸地位而外，其餘各處，德意平分春色。這種平分的關係，再由英國在裏面，演着保一人的角色；（三）英國完全勝利的塲合，則是藉這上面的德意麼擦，拆散「柏林羅馬軸心」，把德國活動限制在東方的波蘭匈牙利；而尤其土耳其的達旦尼爾海峽。絕不容任何强國去仲張她的勢力；最後，假定蘇俄外交上攻勢完全勝利的話，那末，就是東南歐各國集團的結成。以蘇聯爲背景，抵制任何由西而來的偎略者，這就是法、德，意，英，俄五强環繞在桌南歐最近會策的大概，現在，我們說一說東南歐的本身。</p>
<p>波蘭</p>
<p>一向被大家認爲德意集團中一個配角的波蘭，在慕尼黑會議後，忽然出人意料之外的，和蘇俄携起手來了。道携手的程度，在最近德法「不再打仗」宣言簽定後，又更進一步地鞏固了起來。因爲據現在所知，當德國外長里賓特執甫停留在巴黎時，他曾向法國外長龐萊保証：今後的德國主要「興趣」所在，是在於東方，不在於西方的法國領土，因而請法國放心，並要求法國給以一個允諾。就是，在未來的德國東向發展裏，法國不再加以干涉。在法國自國不暇的時候，當然的，達拉第和竉萊祇有順從德國意回的一條路，可是，當這消息爲波蘭所得悉時，立刻就敏銳地覺出德國這所謂東向路綫對於戰本身的的三種含義：（二）索還「波蘭走廊」；（二）要求刻讓德國向蘇聯的烏克蘭發展路上的波簡的個土，使波蘭和東南歐的各國完全隔絕；（三）波蘭向捷克索得的領土，轉交給德國。然而，在波蘭想來，在不遠的將來，德國一定曾向她提出要求；假如波蘭不答應，那末，一定又是發動波蘭境內的少數德國民族，要求所謂「自治」；必要時；就由德國武力來「解放」這少數民族。於是，爲了抵制這個危險起見，波蘭的第一個步驟，是加强蘇波間的挽手關係，第二個步驟，是派出五萬大軍，駐在波蘭的西境，以便應付可能的德國侵略。</p>
<p>假如德國進一步逼迫的話，那末，蘇波間的友好關係會一舉而進爲軍事同盟。</p>
<p>土耳其</p>
<p>凱末爾去世後、在土耳其外交上的重大影響，是失去了一個親英的領袖，所以，在短時期之內，英國在土耳其外交上的領導地位，是動遙了。因而德英俄同時開始了對土耳其的外交活動。</p>
<p>英國目前的態度，難然張伯倫以爲是不必反對德國在士耳其的經濟活動；但德國重要的政治活動。應當限在「東向」的波匈等國，而不要「南向」於土耳其及羅馬尼亞。尤其爲了保持英國與印度問的交通線，英國絕對不能允許任向强國，向達且尼兩海峽伸張勢力。可是，在德國方面，除了經濟活動外，最主要的月的。恰恰是在於取得土耳其的同意，以便加强在達旦尼爾海峽的地位，一遇戰事，她由之北向可以進黑海攻蘇俄，南向可以攻英國與印度間的交通綫。蘇聯呢，當然，她絕對不能坐視土耳其的加入德國的勢力國。</p>
<p>據土耳其官方發表，他今後的外交政策，與凱末爾時代，並無一致；然而，由單獨親英而定向週旋於英德俄三國，以便增强自已地位的趨向，是很明田的。</p>
<p>匈牙利</p>
<p>一般，認為命運久已注定為德國保護國的匈牙利，在他本身的一旺執政者的腦子裏，却並不是這麼想法。德國在捷克的前夜，他的當政者很聰明地逃避了一個先捷克爲德國吞併的危險；事後，又利用意大利的後援，緩和了德國吞併的企圖。現在，爲了防止未來危險計，他時時刻刻地在打算着和波蘭之間，在據屬的領土上，造成兩國間的共同疆界，以便聯合起來。應付德朧未來的吞併。所以，他向捷克要求割讓盧森尼亞。這一要求，引起德國重大的不滿；可是，又因爲是有着意大利後援的緣故，德國不便公然反對。於是，希特勒映便捷克目前的當政者，向英法提出履行對捷克新疆界共同担保的諾言。這裏，張伯倫是不惜一舉手之勞，以邀希特勒好感的，所以，地立刻阻止了匈牙利要求的實現，宣稱英法絕對維護捷克的新疆界。</p>
<p>與波蘭成立共同疆界計劃失敗後的匈牙利，立刻又碍了眼光，向南方看去。現在，她正攷慮着，是不是應當和羅馬尼亞、保加利亞、南斯拉夫、希臘等國，結或同盟，以蘇俄爲背景，共同抵制一切的領土侵略，而作爲先决條件攷盧着的，却是鄂圖大大的成爲匈牙利的皇帝一面，因爲他是希特動的死對頭，一面，藉了王室的關係，以期通過上述各國王室間的聯繋，而訂立同盟。</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島各國中，近來最活躍的是羅馬尼亞。不久以前，羅馬尼亞國王加羅爾，僕僕於英德等國間的這上，所得的結果是：第一，英國的信用借款；第二，由於張伯倫，哈立法克斯兩人的安排、不勺的未來，他還要和意大利的莫索里尼正式談判；第三，在德國，受了希特勒的壓迫，希望他釋放羅馬尼亞類似國社黨的組織所謂「鐵衙十團」首領科得來腦，然而，當加羅爾囘到羅馬尼亞時，他立刻把科得來腦處了死刑，澈底解散了國社黨式的組織。另外，在阿爾巴尼亞和保加利亞等國，也同樣地有德國指揮的反動組織積極活動，甚至連莫索里尼也感到了不安。</p>
<p>因爲種種利害共同的關係，所以，十多天前，在希臘的京城雅典，希·南·羅，土四國的參謀部之間，秘密地舉行了一次重要會議，由希臘的佩佩戈斯將軍主持一切。結果，最主要的决議是是：一，進一步加强彼此的軍事五助；二，互相保障巴爾孵半島各國的完全獨立。</p>
<p>在本文的結尾，我想再重複一句：凡是關心東南歐未來命運的，應當密切汴意未來的張伯倫和莫索里尼的學屬談話。</p>

<h3>香港的剿鼠戰　八年內殺鼠百五十萬</h3>
<p>香港對鼠子的征剿運動·已幾十年於茲了，這種運動足足歷時三十年才生產相當「戰績」，鼠子才不遺禍於人羣，但是，這種征剿運動從化隊三十六元六亳、到加今仍是一貫地進行着！</p>
<p>由一九三零年至今，鼠子死亡於衛生局剿伐之下的，就有一百五十萬之多：然而，我可告訴你，鼠族是不會消滅的。</p>
<p>殺一鼠將銀半角</p>
<p>一對鼠子在十二個月內可以產生一千二百個子孫，現在香港的鼠子，恐怕要比本港的人口多兩三倍。</p>
<p>在本港勦鼠運勸史上，有一個頗趣味的史實，據說香港政府對鼠子實行「紅懸」政策，捉殺一們鼠子，送到衛生局製。就得獎銀半角，可是爲了數目太多，終至取銷。聞說當時有等人利用那個機會，從廣州和澳門輸運死鼠入口賣給政府呢！</p>
<p>一段鼠疫恐怖史</p>
<p>至於香港政府對鼠子何以這么嚴萬呢？大抵老於香港的居民類多耳熟能詳的，因爲一千八百九十四年遠東曾經發生過大鼠疫，這種鼠疫趨於雲南，蔓延到香港，後來又由香港傳染到印度及其他遠東各埠，廣州死十萬人，香港死五千人，面印度尤其厲害；多年間死亡人數，足有千萬人之多，本港經過那年之後，嚴厲推行捕鼠運動，「老鼠箱掛電燈柱」，由是而開端。經過卅年的剿伐，鼠疫才漸漸的滅少。到了一九二九年僅得一宗，而自一九三零年到如令，更連一宗都沒有發現，香港的剿鼠運動，可算告厥功或了！</p>

<p>隻身入店</p>

<h3>又一隊新的行列　投奔到祖國的火線去　克羣　學賬回國服務團第四團定期歸國服務</h3>
<p>「中華無限佳兒女，熱血如潮寫史詩，』這是田漢先生的詩句。</p>
<p>在砠國里，在血與火的交流中，炸彈狂暴的侵襲下，人類大毀滅的悲劇里，無類的新中國的靑年們，在艱苦的鬥爭着，以血和肉的犧牲决心，參予這神聖的自衛戰的行列，把中華民族從滅亡的危機中拯救出來，從半殖民地的領域里尋求解放；在淪陷區內，在火線上，七七個月來的艱苦鬥爭，雖然無數的靑年是「成仁』地犧牲了，可是無數的靑年立刻塡補上那缺去的崗位，他們用血來寫着可歌頌的中華民族解放的史詩。在品上，這「冒險家的樂園』，雖然無數的靑年男女們，在爵士樂和酒的薰陶中沈醉着；但是，在另一面，無數懷着熱血的靑年們，却在嚴肅地工作着，果敢地帶着犧牲的决心組織「囘國服務團』，奔投釗祖國的懷抱去！</p>
<p>隨着「七，七』的炮火而產生的『學生脤濟會」，這是香港學生在大時代的熔爐中所鍛練成的產品，在艱苦的鬥爭中生長起來的香港學生靑年的練匯，在這幾個月來，在如潮的熱血沸騰之下一，已經組成了三個服務團歸國工作去了。現在第四圖又告成立了，一隊新的行列，三十個熱情的靑年，帶着餒肅而又緊張的心情，將在這幾天內投奔到砠國的火綫去。無疑地，他們將會爲中華民族的解放，而盡了他們對砠國的責任，成爲中華民族抗戰有力的一環。</p>
<p>當記者踏進學賑會的時候，一羣靑年正嚴肅而又緊張地在工作着，他們正在計劃着出發的準傭，那年靑的領導者和記者熱烈地握手下。告訴我關於他們組織的經過和工作的方針：</p>
<p>「很慚愧的」以我們應弱的力量來組成這服務團，成績當然不敢設會怎　好，但是我們相信我們的工作方針并沒有錯誤的」。那年肯的團長客氣地說着：「是的，在這次神聖的抗戰中，祖國正需要每個人都貢献出力量，因此，我們這三十個同志，都懷着以最大的犧性决心，投奔到祖國。隨同扼守着四會，馬房前線的某師部，作隨軍服務。我們的技能雖然祇是救護傷兵，慰勞戰士及政治宣傳工作，組織民眾參加到抗×戰線上，求達到了眞正的全民族自衛戰，同時我們還準備開辦難民學校，推進農村的文化，這責任我們是大胆地負担起來的，……」</p>
<p>「你們的同志都是學生嗎？」我　進這一句。</p>
<p>「當然，我們大部份是學生，木過却有着不少是文化工作者，所以在我們的主旨中，就實行了「一面工作，一面學習」了，在砠國正危難的今日，是不再容許我們像囚徒式的呆坐在課堂里了。我們將以一面爲國家服務，一面施行「自我教育」方法，來不斷地增進我們的學識，我們眞的跑進了高爾基所晚的「社會大學」裏去呵」，那年靑的團長略停一下又繼續着說：「還有的，前綫的戰士正缺乏藥品呢？這將會影響到抗戰的方量的：嚴冬了，棉衣也是戰士們所急切祈待着的；我們都是學生，物質的力量當然是談不到，所以我們希望僑胞們的援助。把慰勞品給我們帶到火綫去。同時還希望僑胞們捐助一輛救護車，這也是急切需要的，」他們行期大概巳定在本月二十日左右了！</p>
<p>在熱情的緊握手下，我默祝着他們的前程，和這年育的鬥士羣告別了。歸途中我興奮地覺悟到香港的靑年還不是完全麻醉的，他們那物質缺乏下艱苦的鬥爭，實在使我感動—這正稿感的　　，我將向本港的僑胞們　出呼籲，爲了爭取民族的勝　，騰仲出　　的　事吧！</p>

<h3>從血腥的教訓中得到的進步　活躍的西江游擊隊　游擊隊支隊長朱曼會見記</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>廣州失陷之後，西江的游擊隊以艱辛活躍的姿態出現了。</p>
<p>促進游擊隊突飛猛進的原因：一是當局接受血腥的教訓而積極地策動着；一是由於淪陷區域的前車可鑒，使民眾警覺自己應該武裝起來，保衛自已的家鄉，只有自己的武力，才是最靠得　的武力。</p>
<p>究竟西江游擊隊最近的動態怎樣！日昨記者晤見稅警總團××抗×自衛游擊支隊隊長朱　的報告，略有所知，亟應爲關心祖國的僑胞報道一下。</p>
<p>據朱隊長說：「在廣州未淪陷之前，西江一帶只有自衛團的組織。廣州淪陷以後，該地抗×工作便呈緊張狀態，同時　那裏策動的人也多了起來，十月廿七日以後，×人推進至木棉攬江，當地的民眾切實地感到×人的猙獰面目，和他們的兇殘×行，大家更加强保衛鄉土的决心，振刷成仁取義的精神，抗×工作的進行得到空前的順利。游擊隊成立了，參加者的熱烈，任何人見了都深深的爲之感動。後來經過馬口之役，馬房之役，靑歧之役，大家更看出×人的弱點與無能。×人的來勢表聞好像很兇猛，但是一經游擊隊英勇的反抗，×人的力量便處處呈現脆弱的狀態。最後不得不竄聚在一兩個据點，利用強烈的火力，以圖掩護。而且×人的士氣極爲消沉，這樣更使我們游擊隊的自信心益加堅决。同時處處都有取勝的把握，於是參加游擊隊的人數更加踴躍了截至月前止，由三水至四會之間，游擊隊的總數，已不下十支隊了。</p>
<p>「游擊隊的策動，是採用民眾運動方式，有决心的民眾，在平日各幹他們個別的工作，如耕種，做工，經商，……×人來襲便出動抗×保衛鄉土。這點不能不說是一種進步。</p>
<p>「此外更組織了戰區工作隊，參加的人男女老幼都不限。他們各有任務，各有統屬，這樣的組織發展格爲迅速，而且已有良好的成續表現，在接近×人的地區，堅壁淸野的工作，亦都倚賴他們去執行。</p>
<p>「最近各隊間的聯絡，更加密切了，步驟也史趨一致，這是策動者最認爲快慰的一件事。</p>
<p>×人雖己到達了木棉和欖江。但他們再沒有進展，他們是想盡力去增大他們的×行的，然而那一籌莫展，今後×人雖增加實力，但無論到達西江任何地點，他們必會受到致命的打擊。</p>
<p>聽了朱隊長這一席報告之後。有幾點是值得我們注意的。。</p>
<p>一，共同發展的作風——朱隊長本來還報告很多地自己直接領導的稅警總團游擊隊的詳細情形，亦頗足以告慰同胞；可是朱隊長再三吩咐不便發表，誠恐其他游擊部隊愰會爲標榜自己，有碍統一戰線，所以，只允許發表西江游擊隊之一般動態，並願以後再有詳細之總的報道，這種克服風頭主義，共同發展的作風，的確是從事救亡工作者應有的信念。很多靑年人在抗戰的實踐中已經進步起來了，朱隊長就是其中的一個。</p>
<p>二·捨政從軍的精神——自從神聖的民族抗戰展開之後，投筆從戒的固然很多，捨政從軍的亦頗不打。朱隊畏原本是，廣州市政府的職員，因戰事發生，義憤塡胸出而領導游擊駛，擺脫公務昌的制服而着籃布長褂像老百姓一樣。地內心很熱烈，態度却很沉着。滔滔地報告軍情，煞像一個歷經戰塲的軍事將富一樣。像這一種典型的靑年，在抗戰中生長起來的亦頗不少，這亦未始不是象徵國運的好轉，</p>
<p>三，幹部荒的嚴重問題、關于動員民眾，開展游擊戰爭，目前最感困難的是缺乏幹部。據朱隊長說：動員民眾很需要一批人去接近民眾，組織民眾，教育民眾，像這樣的人才在目前是很缺乏的。自衛團與游學隊中，亦很需要政治訓練的人才，這樣的幹部亦是十分缺乏。所以，他和某先生商談目前很需要訓練一批配合客觀形勢所需要的新幹部，一囘到內地去開展工作。這實在亦是一個值得視重的問題。</p>
<p>西江的游擊隊與反攻廣州，保衛西南，負有重大的任務，我們馨香禱祝他很健全地生長起釆，活躍起來。深願香港的僑胞予以關心與援助。</p>

<h3>福州鼓山</h3>
<p>— 邵晏清</p>
<p>到過閩侯的人、幾乎沒有一個不知道福州的鼓山、山在省城東九公里、據閩江入海的咽喉、有絕頂、白雲、獅子、砵孟，卓錫諸峯、其中以絕頂峯爲最高、離海平面達一千公尺、登峯遠眺、閩中江海地勢、歷歷在目</p>
<p>因峯巔有巨石一塊、狀如石鼓、相傳於暴風雨時、有聲如鼓、故名鼓山、山腰處有湧泉禪寺、俗傳始建於五代、宋眞宗曾賜匾爲「鼓山白雲峯湧泉院」、明改爲寺、嗣遭焚如、淸時始重行興建、傳說最初建寺的人係　　祖師、他和盤踞鼓山的巨龍鬥法後才建的、不過這僅是一則開山闢寺的神話、未可據爲信史、</p>
<p>鼓山的景色非常幽美、山上林木叢茂峯嵐幽選、名勝之多、難以枚舉、其中比較聞名的有喝水巖天梯、龍脊道、印月潭、十八洞、十八景等、但是鼓山最值人留戀的、是到處葱蔚的松柏、遇着風過時、一片濤聲彷彿怒潮澎湃萬馬奔騰一樣的雄壯、到了春天、山灑裏更流着晶瑩的泉水、潺潺的水聲不絕的送入遊客的耳裏、使人們忘却上下山坡的疲勞、</p>
<p>這一切都使鼓山變成聞人旅行和淮香的中心，每年單說朝山的香客和旅行的學生、也就有十萬人左右、聽說國府主席林森氏也是一位常遊鼓山的貴客、</p>
<p>我腦海中有鼓山的印象、那還是遠在童年在閩求學的時候、記得那時想起這座凌霄的高山、小小的心兒當是有些蕩漾，但終以交通不便、所以未曾去遊過、離閩後負　他省接着又是生活覉累、因此更少機會去拜訪這座名山、爲了想慰籍多年未償的渴望、今年秋天、攻設法利用一個短短的假期、和妻搭倫悄悄地離開了繁囂的上海、十月六日、輪抵福州馬港、我們終於踏上了久別多年的故土、心中懷着一陣說不出的欣慰、</p>
<p>抵閩的次晨、我們就和閩中的親屬數人一同去遊鼓山、福州近年的建設委實進步不少、從前到鼓山去、只有水路可通、平時風平浪靜尙須坐上半天的划船、現在不然了、從省城南門搭福馬（福州至馬尾）公路的長途汽車去、只須半小時就到鼓山麓、眞便當多了、</p>
<p>爲了多年未歸、一切都顯着生疏、坐在顛簸的車裏、張望着福州的街景也覺得怪有意味、汽車出城後心神一爽、從車窗望出去、一片無際的黃色稻田、襯着澄碧碧的藍天、在高日普照之下、一切透示着光明與靜穆、</p>
<p>車抵鼓山後、我們跳下來走幾十步、到山麓旁的白雲廨院裏僱了一乘轎子、把隨帶的衣件、鏡箱、小提箱等都堆放在轎裏、我們這才感到一身輕鬆、於是大踏着步、向着整齊而寬長的石級走上去、淸晨的風、吹拂到臉上、微感到一陣凉意、初升的時　被密茂的林木遮薇着，使景象益顯　寒森，　是偶然抬頭一望，燻漫的陽光、却上滿了路右邊的　稍和技頭、在那上面似乎寄着我們無限的滬暖與慰籍、</p>
<p>從山　循着正路到湧泉寺、有石階凡千五百餘級、沿途有亭五處、我們穿過第三個亭子後、轉折入小徑而行、路旁但見成叢的幼樹參差的排列着、更有許多的山石和斑剝的巨巖、零星散在兩旁、也有的層疊在一起、表顯着崢嶸突兀的氣慨、我一邊走着一邊看、大有目不暇接之勢、中午、在某高僧岩洞中午飯、飯罷與僧攀談修身之道、</p>
<p>夕陽裏、晚風吹動着、我們才重新鼓起精神、踏着暮色、向湧泉寺前進、曲曲折折的走過許多石階纔到了一條滿地落葉的幽徑、這時斜陽已被左邊高聳雲際的山壁擋住了、眼前儘是密茂的古松、陣陳的濤聲、隨着晚風送入耳裏、令人感到天然的美麗，過了這段幽徑，便是直通湧泉寺的大道、不停留的脚步、一會兒巳把我們帶到湧泉寺的山門口、</p>
<p>這時天色已經薄暮、但是我們遊興依然很濃、還到寺左近的喝水巖溜了一下才折至禪寺、朦朧中隨着眾人跨進寺的邊門、走過陰暗的天王殿邊廊、接着便是實的十丈左右的天井、天井當中有小池一方、池的兩頭堅着兩桿避雷針、高各十餘丈、低下有「福州造船廠同人鑄贈」等字、閩人迷信　念之深固、於此可見、穿過這天井、便到第二進的大雄寶殿、靠着這大殿的左旁、有一扇小門上面書着「客堂」二字、接着這扇門便是一條走廊、廊左爲客堂與邊廂、右邊是一塊長方形小天井、天井裏排列着幾十盆的菊花、修葺得非常整齊、走廊上來去的學生很多、有的穿中山裝、有的着運動衣、匆匆往來、歌唱聲、談　聲、口琴聲、嘈雜在一起、使我回味到學生時代的宿舍生活、</p>

<h3>由長沙歸來</h3>
<p>— 呂同仁</p>
<p>在這國家垂危民族生命被迫的當兒、凡有點血性的靑年、無不挺身而出、以盡國民一份子的天職、爲了這、我那小小底心兒、終被救亡熱情激動了、我獨自一個人、由安南西貢跑囘香港來、因自己一個人、形影太孤單、於是在港找到一個與我同一心意的舊同學李君、我們底目標、就是計算到陝北去、學習點救亡的學識、和鍛鍊鍛鍊刻苦耐勞的精神、我是不辭家庭而逃出來的、李君也是同我一樣的情形、但他棄學而往、更來得熱情呢、我們初因躊躇於旅費方面無法解决、經了一個多月的籌措、才凑到了一筆小小的欵子、我們就準備着出發了、</p>
<p>這是一九三八年十月十三日的一個早上、天氣和暖、明期可愛、我們倆匆忙忙地、各人携了一個不大不小的皮莢、走到來往省港的碼頭、踏上金山輪、　時乘客非常地擁擠、我們因爲遲到一　、所以連坐臥的床位也沒有了、這只好倚着船　而站立着、剎那問、船兒就把我們載離了香島而駛去、在這金山船上、有四五十個由緬甸回來的靑年男女救護隊、他們是到廣州後卽赴漢口、而到最前線服所的、他們隊伍裏有廣東人、福建人、上海人和緬甸的土人、他們都用國語或英文談話、這四五十個救護員、都是精神飽滿、勇氣勃發的、我們會和他們隊伍中的一個隊員談話、他說他們都是自動參加囘來的、都俱有相當的救護學識、同時、備有藥品和自用汽車多架、我們聽了那隊員的一段話、知道他們是很有組織的、對國家的愛護是很深切的、這不過是數小時的海程、很快的於那天的下午一時、就抵達了羊城、那位和我們談話的救護員、知道我們人地生疏、在上岸時給我們介紹了一所在廣州投宿的旅店、誰料我們到那里找尋時、該寓所早己被無情的×機炸毀了，我們只好走到沙面的一間華南旅店去、</p>
<p>這是我們所料想不到的一回事、戰爭就會這樣地緊張起來、抵廣州的那晚、來拌省港的交通、就停斷了、虎門封鎖、一時情形極爲倫惶、羊城是我從未來過的都市、警報和大砲的聲、是我所未聽見過的、雖在這惶惶中一點也不會令我們驚動、我們始終是存着前進勿退後的决心、第二天還沒有火車開赴漢口、所以一連的住了三天、在這三天中、沒有一天×機不來轟炸、可說是整天都在警報中、夜裏全市是佃黑團團的、一點光色也沒有、那時市民已在紛紛地遷走、街上幾乎連秩序也沒有了、我們一點也不怕、出外找朋友呀、購買應用的東西呀、到八路軍駐粵辦事處領介紹書呀、什麼都很興奮、廣州我初到的第一天、還有那些精砷　發的靑年男女學生軍可以看到、直至第二三天、情形已經不對了、這般受訓的學生、已經走了、一個也不見了、聽說是當局的命令、在這嚴重和極需作戰幹部的時候、當局爲何便令他們先走、給我們意識淺薄的想來、那似乎是不對的、但當局們究竟屬何計策、那是我們不得而知的了、</p>
<p>十六晚很僥倖地才搭到一輛開漢的慢車、這里還要說一說我們往搭車的危險、和可笑的一段事、那晚有兩輛車開行、一是特別快車、一是慢車、因爲在這緊張的時期裏、軍人和搭客特別地多、快慢兩車幾乎連一個空隙的坐位也沒有了我們因要早一點離開廣州、所以想搭特快車先走、可是位子沒有了、那怎樣辦呢、車頂上也有人上去坐、我們也跟了他們爬上去、後來越想越不妥當、又是慌張張地爬了下來、你想在那麼高的車頂上不是給寒氣凍傷、遇着×機來襲時、更是危險、那輛慢車也是充滿了人、在道紛惶惶的人羣裏、我們倆的心兒實在萬般　急逼、好像熱鍋上的　蟻、不知怎樣地好、因那晚的車如趕不上的話、不知要到什麼時候才能前往、後來戰們找到一位郵局裏的辦事人、向他說了好多懇切的話、才許了我們上車、給一個狹小的空隙、讓我們勉强的坐下了、</p>
<p>我們一跨上了這粵漢　就聽見車裏的人說的都是國語、這值得我們來領會領會的、由廣州直到漢口的車要，國幣十二元，我們因在售票處買不及車票、上了車後才補票、天剛要亮的時候、發出警報的呼聲、那時已是寒冷的天氣、我們在黑茫茫的原野　、敏快的由車上跳了下來、逃避到森林裏去、但行李都放在車上一直到天亮才解除了警報、這樣一路避了無數次×機、有時竟日也沒有開車、因停避在察野間、整天連點飯也沒有下到社裏去、最辛苦的就是那些細手細脚的婦孺、也要跟着我們同樣地爬山越嶺、鑽樹林、車每到一站、就作幾分鐘的停息、有警兵在守候、有小販們拿了食物來向搭客兜售、我們經渦曲江、樂昌、衡陽、和好多較小市鎭、不能把它記得出來、我們還越過了十幾個山洞、車一進去、好像在夜裏行車、一點陽光也看不出來、車軌和橋樑好多給×機炸毀的、但炸後隨有工人在修築、沒有什麼地阻　、搭客有的在半路下了車、有的是直抵長沙漢口的、所以不比初行時那樣地擁擠、人也覺得舒暢得多、如此的挨過了三晝夜、於十九晚才抵達了長沙、</p>

<h3>本港皮革業現狀　熟皮市場穩定　生皮出口鋭減</h3>
<p>皮革爲製造革履之原料、吾國年中生牛皮之出產、雖屬不少、但熟皮之製造、尙未得其法、故一方輸出生皮、一方運入熟皮、查本港熟皮十九來自澳洲之雪梨、加拿大僅佔入口額十分之一、加拿大及雪梨熟皮爲製造西鞋底用、因此聞市民多以西鞋是尙、故每年貿易額一百五六十萬元、化消於本市者佔百分之七八十、運銷國內各地者、僅佔百分之二三十、自廣州淪陷後、內地市塲更受影響、皮革價格大都根據匯水之漲落而伸縮、目前雪梨皮革市價，每担由五十元至六十元、（隨品類而定）、上貨每祖由一百元至一百二三十元、加皮每祖則由一百七十元至一百八十元</p>
<p>珠皮則爲製造鞋面之用、每年入口額亦達七八十萬元、德國產佔百分之八十、餘百分之二十則產自美國、其價格每尺計值八角至一元、</p>
<p>紅皮爲製造華裝鞋底之用、來源以庇能爲最大宗、幾佔全額三分之二、星加坡次之、佔三分之一、其餘暹羅、海防、安南等地、雖有來源、但極爲稀少、查紅皮每年貿易額達二百餘萬元、運銷廣東內地者佔百之五十、其餘除運銷小數往廣州灣外、十九爲本港客　所化消、去年春、內地雖有紅皮之製造、但僅家庭工藝性質、產額極少，紅皮目前市價、可概分爲：上貨每担六十五元、中貨每担五十元、下貨每担四十二元（在七七前每担約低十元）、現因香港與內地交通不便關係、故市况極爲黯淡、</p>
<p>生皮爲本國所產、分爲黃牛皮、水牛皮兩種、由本港輪出國外者、全爲兩粵所產、每年數達四五百萬元、運銷地以日本德國爲最大宗、幾各佔全額百分之五十、英、意、法、美市場僅佔少數、自中日戰事發後、日本統制入口貨、故本國生皮出口、隨之消失百分之五十、故生皮價格同時瀉落、</p>
<p>生皮目前市價、黃牛皮每担值六十至七十元、水牛皮每担值四十元至五十元</p>
<p>本港九龍現有製皮廠五六家（紅皮革皮）、取法歐美、成績頗佳、每年出產額二三十萬元、原料以兩粵生皮靠多、因本港屠牛不足供用也、</p>

<p>農歷元旦、菲律濱來港比賽足球事、經已喧傳多時、現時雖未得菲方正式答覆、但根據日前變方（港菲）主事人之去雁來鴻、則菲隊之來港、可成事實、</p>
<p>依照港滬埠際足球規朋、軍人球員入選之數目、是有限制、惟此次港菲埠際賽、則無此例、現駐港之海陸空軍好手甚多、故將來遷出之陣勢、必定强勁、</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……海角遊魂</p>
<p>Alglers</p>
<p>故事的背景是一個神秘奇怪得像「天方夜談」中所描寫過的地方、地名叫阿爾吉、雖則現在是法國的屬地、城市的一部份相當現代化、但另一在屬於土著居住的部份、却仍完至保留著東方古代的神秘色調、在那里是無法無天、賊匪和亡命之徒會聚的所在、導演把　麼的一個背景、處　得　盡陰森肅殺的能事、更羅　一段動人的故事、匪徒們陰險殘暴的行　、使每一寸膠片、都充滿着神秘·恐怖、強烈的刺激力量、</p>
<p>故事敘述一個國際劇盜、亡命混跡在這地方、同黨的出賣、警探的園捕、都給他狡晚、獨獨屈服在一個獎　的法國女郎——而喪失了生命，</p>
<p>却爾斯飽育在此片中對于匪的性格、有極深刻的表現、嘗演「慾燄」的女主角、希地拉瑪、演技　優秀、薛烈嘉　、她在第一部片、「馬可勃羅遊華記」中、飾忽必烈女兒的時候、留給我們一個極良好的印象、在此片中節一個盡情盡意、熱戀着那劇盜的土著五郎、那種出色的海　、是值得我們特別　賞的、</p>
<p>皇后……大口女追海軍</p>
<p>Give　Me　A　Sailor</p>
<p>瑪莎蕾和飽勃霍潑以前的幾度合作、成績皆極美滿、在本片中、更有優異的演作、証明他們　是一對極適合的搭當，片中有的是層出不寫的笑料、對於爲零娛樂而看電影的觀眾們、是一部台乎理想的作品、</p>
<p>故東是描寫一些美國水兵、在假叨中瘋狂放蕩的生活、其中一對在同艦受職的雜兄難弟、印因追錯了戀愛目標、而鬧了不少的英語、</p>
<p>瑪莎蕾是本片趣味的中心人物、她飾一個無人　憐而却自作多情的少女、自始至終，鄱保持着極優秀的演作、鮑勃、他那付怪難　情的面部表情，和他幽默雋永的口白，可并稱雙絕、</p>
<p>合演的還有員蒂格拉勃一個美麓活潑的女星、她還有着一個淸妙動聽的歌喉、全片共有新歌四隻、皆音樂名家近作、由她二人演唱、增加了本片不少的娛樂意味</p>
<p>平安……軍械間牒黨</p>
<p>The　Spy　Rlng</p>
<p>一部沒甚可取的間諜影片、福導者對於簡諜們的活動與及冒險陰謀等情節、概未能儘量發揮，更加上馬球賽和一些詼諧塲面的勉强穿捆、雜凑成這一部不倫不類的影片、</p>
<p>故事是敘述一班國際間諜、怎樣在美國活動、想倫新發　的防空利器的圖樣、但因發明者的英勇伶俐終於破滅了他們的狡計、各海員演技、也皆極平凡、</p>
<p>東方……阿拉伯風雲</p>
<p>I　Coyer　The　War</p>
<p>一張早年的戰事影片、描寫美索不達米亞叛亂的情形、同時挿入一段羅曼史、要是毒現在的眼光去看、那麼、裏面的幾　戰爭出面、不能說是成功、主角是約翰　、</p>
<p>大華……紅顏易老</p>
<p>You＇re　Only　Youug　Once</p>
<p>是給靑年很有各處的一部社會片、給靑年男女在戀愛方面一種有力的啓示、</p>
<p>故事寫一個幸福家庭、主人是一位公正賢明的法官、他有子女各一、當他全家在加州旅行時、他的子女各走入錯綜戀勢的歧途、他煞費苦心的把他的子女拯救出來、</p>
<p>難然是很乎凡的故事、因導演手法不弱、使它很淸麗沽潑的開展、演員方面、因爲支配得當、所以有很好的演出、尤其是飾法官的魯意史東、對於理會靑年人戀愛心理的表演、刻劃人微、</p>
<p>景星……金銀島</p>
<p>Treasure　Island</p>
<p>即以名著「金銀島」故事改編成的影片、主角爲華雷斯皮策、賣克　柏、里　巴里穆亞、演出十分完美、</p>
<p>中央……大戰飛　客</p>
<p>Gallopfng　Ghost</p>
<p>美國一家小公司共和的出品、毫無藝術上價值可言的影片、全是以胡鬧式的搏鬥及庸俗的　險塲面以翼取悅觀眾、正如廣告上說繼『海底電國」後之大貢獻、</p>

<h3>路</h3>
<p>— 余平</p>
<p>爲着路，許多人苦惱着，尤其是在大時代中的靑年人。盡管有不少革命導師在指示我們，但正如其先生所說：「在前綫和後方戰鬥着和工作着的，固然有不少的是靑年，但多數靑年到現在還爲義思想問題，政治問題，和組織問題而感覺到苦悶和徬徨，或感受到有力無處用和有智識無由貢献」。</p>
<p>擺在我們面前的似乎有許多路，又似乎完全沒有路。問題其實是在自已有沒有跑路的决心和勇氣，能力尙在其次。一句話說，還是我們的小脊產階級意識在作崇。本來面前有大路可行，但受了動搖意識的迷惑，弄到昏昏然，從猜疑以至看不見路。但雖然自以爲沒有路而悲觀·失望·可是事賓上只要他活着一天，他還是在路上，不過這不是他理想的路罷了。</p>
<p>世界本沒有如我們想像的好，也沒有如我們想像的壞。只要你肯幹，敢面對規實，跟生活鬥爭，路是有的。魯迅先生似乎這樣說過：「路本來是沒有的，往後才給人踏出來。」（大意如此）。我們不能囘祖國，不能上前線殺×，到後方發動民眾，到淪陷區打游擊，難道就沒有路—嗎？我們要突擊，從沒有路中殺出路來。這並不是不可能，生活本來就是一種鬥爭。</p>
<p>任誰都知道，我們要從動的發展去觀察事物，同時要雙活的去運用正確的理論。處置路的問題也得如此。人既使能離開環境，也不應屈服於環境；處世的祕訣就任乎能適應環境，利用環境，進而支配環境。自以爲找不到路的朋方們，這也是我們找路的祕訣啦！</p>
<p>生活就是鬥爭！珍重吧！</p>
<h3>從哥雅說起</h3>
<p>— 開勤</p>
<p>因爲日本「第一流作家」佐藝春夫到上海賞鑒戰後的閘北，說是像看見哥雅底書一樣，我於是想起了目前繪畫上的一些問題。</p>
<p>實在說來。若是目前眞的有哥雅那樣的畫家，倒是極需要的。目先不說他已經有著名的「戰爭的災害」，類作品，就只以他作晝的態度來說，他若是只在目前，他底作品一定會有絕大的作用。但那作用不待說却不是佐藤春去所追求的奇特味。</p>
<p>我們可以坦白地說，像這樣的書家，中國根本便沒有過，中國底國俗畫，往并只是簡單的歷史畫，而且最高的成就，也不過勉强可以比一比法國羅珂珂時代的畫家華朶（Wa　tteau）而已。但這也只能勉强地比一比。不過在淸末，却出現了一位大畫家，那便是吳嘉猷號叫作友如的這個人。</p>
<p>這位畫家底名宇已經很久被人忘却了，最近有人談「上海掌故」，纔絲被附帶地提起。這是應該的。吳友如底功績，從一般說來是有兩種：第一，創作了眞正的風俗畫；第二，創作了大規模的四環圖畫。這兩項，在中國底畫史上，都算是空前的。他不但使繪來和時事發生了密切關係，而且還卅繪畫作了反抗外議的武器。我手頭並沒有「點石齊畫報」「飛影閣畫報」，不過記得他底作品中，除了關於當時主要時事的中法戰爭的描寫外，還有對於租界法庭的抗議·自然，他沒有直接反對過濟廷，甚至有時還表揚過淸廷，而他寫實的按術有時也是幼稚的，但那些都應當歸之於他底現境和他底時代。</p>
<p>在近人著的研究中國繪畫的著作（例如俞劍華先生底「中國繪畫史」）中，幾乎就沒有吳友如這惆名字。和吳友如同時間也是住在上海，也是以書人物出名的晝家，大家却甯可記得一個錢慧安·原因是：錢是雅。吳是俗。自然，若照中國畫學的理論來說，錢是够格的。但錢幣整的是甚麼呢，只是完全和他底周圍亳沒有關涉的一些士女（那和吳所作的厯史書根本是不同的）。雅，自然是好的，不過雅到絕頂我看還是大米底山水爲最徹底，用筆去任意地點一陣，每絲亳「匠氣」也不帶的，然而那用處却是怎樣，也叫人說不出來。</p>
<p>我並不是說，目前的畫家一定要學吳友如；我只是說，像吳友如那樣的畫家在目前依然是需要的。它那種熊度，那種計劃，那種取村，目前的畫家都有注意的必要。倘是現在能有畫家像吳友如一樣，辦一種那樣的畫報，我看依然還有作用。自然，眞正的新聞，現在是的照像了，然而像吳友如似的，提煉出時事的精華，描出追擊與議刺的實在脚色。而且更不妨像吳友如畫的，在盡端加一段通俗的解釋，那還是極有意義的。—至於技術須更進步的，更是熔化於新的技術中的，那自然是無須多說。</p>
<p>現在上海還有美術學校。可是我根本不知過那事面課程是怎麼樣。不過照一向的「藝風」推測起來，現在到郊外去寫生自然是辦不到了，但大概還是盡室為烘起火來。描着身體的模特兒。所拷貝的人概還是拉飛且一流底聖母像罷。甚本的課程，這也不能說不該學的。不過在目前，我以爲既是有時間用西洋過去的作品來鍛鏡藝術，那與其拷貝拉飛耳，倒眞的不如拷貝高雅一點底作品要有片處得多，還有像杜米艾（Daumfer），羅多萊克（Toulouse　Lautrec）等作品，我覺得學一學也未必錯。這只是隨時想起的兩個畫家，那種藝術應用在目前，自然是不够，然而那種方法要是展開時，至少可以暴露這個畫上某部分的糜爛，至少可以淋演地鈎出漢好底原形。不過這兩個畫家在西部却也被謠爲有「匠氣」的畫家，美術史上也往往沒有他們底名字的。</p>
<h3>關於嘉定屠城記</h3>
<p>— 楊寶正</p>
<p>—明末民眾抗淸的報告文學—</p>
<p>「嘉定屠城記」這，原名「東地日剳」，也稱「嘉定「酉紀略」，是一部紀載過寫明朝末年嘉定民眾怎樣的抗戰的—作者朱子素先生，是親歷其境的，他所記的當然是很親切的事買。常明朝末年。吳三桂引淸兵南下。漢奸都相他投誠，及揚州既破，民眾還困守抗戰的，有江陰崑山嘉定松江及金山衛·揚州和嘉定江陰的抗戰。最是熱烈悲壯。而遭屠殺也最厲害。所謂嘉定三屠，揚州上日。當時還有這樣的口頭禪。說是「苦要苦於嘉定，慘募慘於江陰！」當時慘痛的情况，是可想而見的！</p>
<p>「東塘日剳」是當時的實錄，是第一流的民族意識的報告文學，作者朱子素先生字九初，補邑庠生·甲申需次禮部，棄去不就，隱居教授，當然是一氣節之士，他還編輯有歷代遣民錄，果略文獻哀貞錄等，都是富於民族意識的，那朱先生遺部描寫為定民族抗戰的作品，當然也富于民族意識的。據我所知，現在這書的刊本有六：</p>
<p>（一）荊駝通中本</p>
<p>（二）明季稗史本</p>
<p>（三）紀載彙綿本</p>
<p>（四）申報館鉛印本</p>
<p>（五）中國內亂外禍叢</p>
<p>書本</p>
<p>（六）慕慶甲子惠塘朱</p>
<p>春生抄稿本</p>
<p>朱春生抄稿卒署原名「東塘日剳」，前有朱九初節略，後有甲子正月二十三日夜朱春生跋。今蔽嘉定周承忠處，曾一度鉛印行世。原本在前上海市傳物館所間的上海文献展覧會中曾陳列過。把這本和以前刊本比較，知道以前的刊本都已經淸朝人的竄改，失掉了本來的面目—而這抄稿本却是朱子素先生的原稿。</p>
<p>這沙稿本稱民眾的「義兵」爲「我軍」，稱「淸兵」爲「北兵」。凡淸廷新封的新貴。也一律不冠「淸」而稱「北」。而許多刊本都稱「大淸」「淸兵」，又稱「豫王」爲「大滿統軍元師』，當然不是有民族意識的朱子素先生的手筆。這抄稿本批評當時嘉定的藉令，說縣令錢默「意不在官，人無法紀。」而日本都刪了—證以嘉定寐獨所署，「傷齋見開録」。也說：</p>
<p>「嘉定新令則南煙浙江嘉善之錢不識也，名默，與前曹令同榜進士，在席成爲面家子弟，年少以英？聞，及爲政事，專尙剝創，民多怨難！」</p>
<p>當時縣令錢默，的確是一個剝削民眾的公干哥兒，但是刊本把他的罪狀刪創了，把他的罪惡隱藏了！</p>
<p>這抄稿本稱當時有個叫蔣若來的，，眞是個忠節之士，說「北兵入南部，若來遁歸，自殺其妻子，入淘依義陽王，」他殺了妻子然後逃通入海，是多麼有氣節，而刊本却稱若來爲「市井無賴以膂力遭逢擢造，官至都瞥，聞維揚陷，秦職而逃。」蔣若來竟是一個凟職的無賴了—這抄稿本稱若來「視庫存銅銃數十，使人舁之以行，遂中徐家口入海，」它把嘉定所仔的重兵器携走。免得重敵，這樣撤退時最必要的，而刋本却又這麼一改。說若來「遽趨時，僅存銅錢數十千，舁之行，過徐家行大掠，寸縷點遺，農民哭聲震天。」蔣若來竟是個土匪了！淸朝人改竄的本領，眞够巧妙，把「銅銃數十」改為銅錢數千，把「遂由徐家行入海」改成「還徐家行大刦」，這樣改還不够說得圓，於是再添上了「寸縷無遺，貧民哭離露天」二句！</p>
<p>還有，當外圍婁塘的義兵。和梁得勝大戰時。蔣兵打了一次大勝仗、在信抄稿本上，描寫得很詳細很沽現</p>
<p>「惟時我軍幾潰，而外岡婁塘兵接戰簽力，念三鄒素稱盜薇。其人整肆敢戰，新殺鍛；漏下數刻，各鄉兵蜂擁而集，競畢燒（梁）得勢船，（李）成栜自卜維揚金陵昆陵京口諸處所獲精金美珠，名劍寶刀無數，悉付一炬，其未及燬者，盡爲鄉兵掠去，船中多載婦女。被焚甚慘，其中有一女最美麗，呼曰：「我翰林官女，家在揚州，被據至此，幸救我！」鄉兵皆曰：「可躍入水！」女哭曰：「我足被鎖不得脫！」語未竟，烈火燒其足矣！烟燄蔽大，紅光耀十餘里。天明始熄，得勝夜東奔，狼狽得逃。」</p>
<p>這里義兵的襲擊火攻，是多麼神勇！外罔一帶，至今民情還很强悍，平時的匪盜，等到大時代的到來，挺身出而爲義勇的豪傑。古今是一輸的，而巳經給淸人改實過的刋本，只是廖寥的幾句，說：「天明囅得勝兵首級共八十顆，得勝餘眾東奔，狼狽得逃。」</p>
<p>明末清初這，民族意議的作品，經淸朝人動亂改竄，搬弄黑白的地方，眞不知有幾許，這「嘉定屠城記」，也是一例。</p>
<h3>兩個時代的距離</h3>
<p>— 孟起</p>
<p>有一次來信說，雖在鄉間。診金還是太貴，而且也未見効，因此在吃「仙方」。我父親科學知識雖有限，平素却是極端反對迷信的，母親也是个極明事理的女子，不服藥而吃「仙方」，無非爲的省錢，父親的病或許因此躭誤了也未可知，這又是使我抱憾終天的一件事！</p>
<p>父親的對我，眞是克繼父職。在我續書到大學二年級的時候，家庭經濟情形，因其突然的變故，實巳無法支撐我的學費。（那學校費用的昂貴，國內數上第二位。）但他總是多方張羅着使我愉快地繼續讀書，而且從來不願意把窘迫的情形使我知這。我記得那時學校里雜用很多。凡是別人繳的，他總勉力設法給我，當時我亳無所知，後來問他，也說並下是爲顧自已的體面，而是怕摜壞了靑年人的自尊心。又記得有一年過廢曆人除夕白天父親色神似乎很不安定但到晚上點起大蠟燭祭祖時，父親恢復了溫如的面容，勸我們喝酒，說艱難尙說而實在並不怎樣令人發笑的笑話。更深了，我同父·和母親「辭歲」。他神采飛揚地摸出壓歲錢給我，說：「給你買心愛的東西」。我那時只有十幾歲，略略能「鑒貌辦色」，窺出父親定有什麼隱衷，再三追問毋親，毋親才倫倫地告訴我，是因爲沒有壓步錢，父親躊躇了半天，終於把他心愛的王如意抬出去「當」了踐。下一天「大年初一」，神桌上果然不見了父親最心愛的玉如意。我曾爲這事感動得哭了幾囘。（未完）</p>
<h3>我們在翁源的工作</h3>
<p>— 曼蕾</p>
<p>我們離開廣州後，就到了據處廣東北江邊陲的翁源。</p>
<p>翁源這地方，是北江一個重要富儲的縣區，山勢很險要，四處都有公路可直釗東北江一帶，顯然，要是一個窮鄉僻壤的地方，但是這裏有很廣漢的田塲·鄉人都以耕種爲業。縣內還有好幾所小學和重要機關設立；還有一所貧良救濟院，可是自十月十五十六日的兩三天，經過了×人的飛機發動空前轟炸後，城裏的商店十家九空，整個的翁源城和小小的墟鎭那變成瓦礫之塲了。我們的工作團體就是住在翁源城外黃塘鄉的附近，距離翁源城不過一投石之遠。連日×機慘炸鄉民紛紛逃避。這裏有許多祠則和破陋的屋宇矗立着，祠堂門外許多刻着「應宿第」，「大夫第」，「直奉第」等等的字樣，彷彿點綴着古代埃及羅鳥式的宮崩。由道可以推測許多祠廟巳有很久的歷史。我們的寢室很樸素，整齊，淸潔，我們和鄉人買了蔑角錢的乾稻草鋪在地上面，便可以高臥。</p>
<p>我們每週都有好幾個座談會，小組會網，討論會，檢討會等等，有時，隊長曾讓我們練習夜行軍，游擊戰術等。在白天的時候我們便出發去工作，每到一個小鄉，墟鎭，召集一旺鄉民、說明民眾救國的重要，或是篷着墟期的日子。趁着這個整鬧的地方和他們開始個別的談話，或家庭訪問的力式，用着一種最簡單。最通俗的音調和他們解釋×人的狂炸，和暴露出喪心病狂的漢奸活動。我們發動清縣的鄉民都是側重宜傳，文字·圖畫·歌詠，戲劇等工作。雖然他們有些都是文盲或是智識淺陋的鄉民，從來不了解抗戰救亡的意義。但是他們對於戰塲上的傷兵和救護，是非常同情和熱心的。</p>
<p>我們過去兩月工作值得注意的，大概有下面幾項：（一）積極推動各鄉區內的民眾，組織民眾，訓練民眾參加救亡團體及自團衛保衛家鄉，保衛國家。（二）聯絡各鄉區的保甲長；五相與鄉民連合起來，（三）要找着工作中心的對象，（四）對於霄語要通俗化，簡單化，使他們能够領略。以上四者對於今日民連工作是不可忽略的先决問題，今日有志民運的靑年，應該對於這一方面，多多加以注意。</p>

        <h1>1939.01.11</h1>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Visit to Rome</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Rome with Foreign Secretary Halifax was decided as early as the Munich Agreement in late September of last year. Given Mr. Chamberlain's advanced age of seventy, his willingness to travel tirelessly for the sake of peace is truly admirable. However, attempting to clarify the world situation through compromise with aggressor nations may, in fact, prove counterproductive. It is reminiscent of the time when Chamberlain earned the reputation of a "peace envoy" during the resolution of the Czech-German dispute, but in reality, the crisis in Europe remained latent, and the so-called peace was merely a temporary state of uneasy calm! Nevertheless, this does not dampen the courage of this "peace envoy," so this trip to Rome is definitely not a mere formality. The significance of his intentions is evident, and the following points are worthy of attention:</p>
<p>1.  Adjustment of British-Italian relations. Since the Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, British support for the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy has led to a deterioration in relations. Italy, facing financial difficulties, especially after annexing Abyssinia, needed funds both due to the excessive wartime consumption and the desire to develop the conquered territories. Aside from borrowing from Britain, there was no better solution. Therefore, although Mussolini habitually used intimidating and blackmailing tactics, he always maintained a policy of appeasing Britain and suppressing France, because only in this way could he salvage his financially desperate crisis. In recent years, however, Mussolini has been determined to gain control of the Mediterranean, thereby controlling the British and French routes to the East, particularly the British communication lines with India and Australia. This ambition has caused Britain constant unease. During the Munich Conference, Chamberlain could generously sacrifice Czechoslovakia, whereas in 1935, he strongly opposed Italy's invasion of Abyssinia. The reason lies herein. Furthermore, Britain possesses vast colonies in Africa, with a large portion of its East African territories bordering Abyssinia. Once Italy's power in Abyssinia is stabilized, Britain's colonies could be invaded at any time because Mussolini's main policy is to restore the glory of the ancient Roman Empire, and his ideology is based on war and aggression. Chamberlain's trip to Rome this time is to probe Mussolini's true intentions, then seek to adjust British-Italian relations, and engage in negotiations on the Mediterranean issue and the British-Italian African territorial boundaries.</p>
<p>2.  Franco-Italian problems. After the resolution of the German-Czech dispute, Mussolini believed that the diplomatic policy adopted by the British and French authorities today is to avoid trouble and maintain peace, even at the cost of any compromise or sacrifice, to clarify the European situation. Furthermore, after the Munich Agreement, France lost the support of its allies, and the Franco-Soviet Pact became a mere formality, leaving its international standing isolated. This led to the demands for territory from France in the Italian Parliament on November 30, and the unilateral declaration of the annulment of the Rome Agreement signed in January 1935 in late December of last year. The relationship between France and Italy has been fluctuating tightly in the past two months. As it stands, Italy certainly lacks the capacity for foreign warfare, but since fascist countries take aggression as their sole national policy, as does Germany, as does Japan, why should Italy be an exception? In the end, if their goals cannot be achieved, they might take a great risk and resort to force to achieve their aims. On the French side, public sentiment is fierce, and French Prime Minister Daladier has repeatedly stated that France is willing to compromise with all countries for the sake of peace, but it would be a major error to mistake this for weakness in French policy. On the 6th of this month, in his speech at the reception of the Governor-General of Algeria, he stated: France's determination to protect its territories remains unchanged. … The French territory extends from the Flanders Plain to the banks of the Congo River, and its influence extends to Asia. If necessary, France will not hesitate to go to war to safeguard freedom and the freedom of all nations. Anyone who seeks to undermine the integrity of France will meet with our strong resistance. From this, we can see that France will not concede to Italy's territorial demands. If the current crisis between France and Italy cannot be resolved, the appeasement of the European situation cannot be achieved. This time, Chamberlain does not hesitate to undertake the long journey, and Italy welcomes him warmly, precisely to use him as a mediator to achieve his insatiable ambition. Although France has expressed its unwillingness for British interference in mediating the Franco-Italian conflict, it is undoubtedly one of the main tasks of Chamberlain's visit to Italy. We can see that Chamberlain first went to Paris to meet with Daladier en route to Rome, which shows that his intention was to test the attitude of the French government in preparation for mediation.</p>
<p>3.  Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The fact that the Spanish Civil War has been prolonged for more than two years is due to the support of the rebel forces by Italy and Germany. In particular, Italy wants to gain a base within Spanish territory to threaten France, and at the same time, increase its power to control the Mediterranean. Therefore, overthrowing the Spanish Republican government is a major conspiracy. During the Munich Conference, Chamberlain and Mussolini reached an understanding on the withdrawal of Spanish volunteers. However, Italy did not fulfill its promise afterward. Although several thousand volunteers were withdrawn from Spain at that time, in reality, these volunteers were injured and disabled, and had lost their combat capabilities. According to reports from Paris in late last month, Mussolini instigated the Spanish rebel army to launch a general offensive on December 15, and the Italian Air Force assisted in the battle, so as to create a "fait accompli in Spain" on the day Chamberlain arrived in Rome. From this, it can be seen that the resolution of the Spanish issue may encounter great difficulties.</p>
<p>If the above three points cannot be resolved, the new Four-Power Conference will not be possible. From our observations, Chamberlain's dedication to peace is admirable, but his tendency to accommodate totalitarian countries in everything may only increase the threat to peace. The result of the Munich Agreement accelerated Hitler's aggressive ambitions in Eastern Europe. In Southern Europe, there is Mussolini's coveting of French territory. In the East, it triggered the Japanese militarists' attack on South China, posing a serious threat to Hong Kong. Rooting out the source and clarifying the situation is the only good way to establish peace. This point, I believe, has already been noted by the wise rulers of Britain!</p>

<h3>Our West River Forces Advance Towards Sanshui, Initial Counter-Offensive Concluded, All Routes Set to Converge on Guangzhou</h3>
<p>【Zhao Qing Urgent Dispatch】Fourth War Zone Commander Zhang Fakui, determined to recover Guangzhou in a short period, dispatched telegrams to the east, west, and north routes simultaneously. The military situation has taken a sharp turn for the better, progressing smoothly. According to a certain official here, our counter-offensive forces towards Guangzhou, after the recovery of Dongguan, Taiping, Shilong in the east, Sanshui, Foshan in the west, and Conghua, Huaxian in the north, will converge from all routes for a general assault on Guangzhou. Overall, the fighting on all routes in recent days indicates that our initial counter-offensive has concluded. As we enter the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, our counter-offensive military operations will see greater progress. The recovery of Guangzhou is only a matter of time. The future of the Guangdong war is extremely optimistic. The following is a record of the situation on the West River:</p>
<p>Defensive Line Established on the West River</p>
<p>Since the successive reinforcements of troops to Sanshui, Southwest, Jiujiang, and other places, they have been restless and plotting to invade the West River. West River Headquarters Director Xu Jingtang reorganized the military defense of the West River, designating Gaoyao, Sihui, Gaoming, and Heshan counties as the first line of defense, garrisoned by the Guangdong and Guangxi armies. Deqing, Yunfu, Yunan, Fengchuan, Luoding, and Guangning counties were designated as the second line of defense, defended by a certain unit and local self-defense teams. Therefore, our defenses on the West River are not only strong enough to resist the invasion but also well-equipped for a counter-offensive at any time. Director Xu Jingtang issued an order to attack the enemy forces in Sanshui. Our troops on the Gaoyao and Sihui front lines are advancing steadily towards the enemy forces in Sanshui.</p>
<p>County Teams Confer on Joint Defense</p>
<p>After the completion of our West River defense arrangements, Deputy Commander Chen Dousu of the 19th Guerrilla District and Commander Ma Yi of the 2nd Guerrilla District convened a joint defense meeting yesterday at a certain location to discuss joint defense and eradication of traitors. Attendees included Liang Naisen of Gaoyao, Tan Ruichu of Gaoming, Mai Xingfu of Heshan, Ye Jichang of Xinxing, Liu Zicai of Yunan, Peng Songru of Luoding, Chen Youshan of Yunfu, Li Jiong of Deqing, Li Zipei of Guangning, Liang Haiqi of Fengchuan, Wu Binghua of Kaijian, and Li Zhongren of Sihui, among others. During the meeting, various measures were discussed and decided upon regarding joint defense, eradication of traitors, and establishing regulations. It was also decided to requisition civilian firearms, expand guerrilla units, and strengthen self-defense forces. Regarding the replenishment of ammunition, the Self-Defense Corps Management Office of the Fourth War Zone was requested to provide as much as possible. At the same time, it was stipulated that the junctions of Gaoming and Heshan should be jointly defended by elite troops drawn from the county teams and regular forces. The upper reaches of the West River will be strictly consolidated by the county teams in conjunction with a certain unit of the Guangxi army. Currently, the county teams are implementing the plans agreed upon at the meeting.</p>
<p>Enemy Attempts to Plunder Grain</p>
<p>According to reports, the invading enemy forces in Guangdong are facing extreme difficulties in the supply of grain and supplies. The enemy forces stationed in Guangzhou, Nanhai, Huaxian, and Sanshui are lacking food and clothing. Therefore, they have repeatedly sent troops to plunder grain and clothing. The enemy forces in Jiujiang, Lianglong, and Sanshui are in particular need of grain. Before their fall, Jiujiang and Lianglong were already facing a grain shortage. After their fall, the remaining grain was looted by the enemy. The people fled to other places, and the fields were barren. Therefore, the enemy is recently attempting to attack Gaoming, Gulao, and Sanzhou to plunder food. However, the enemy lacks the combat capability to invade Guangxi. Deputy Commander Deng Yanhua of the First Guerrilla District has ordered the guerrilla teams of Nanhai, Shunde, and Sanshui to intercept the enemy forces at any time in the rear of the enemy forces in Nanhai, Panyu, and Shunde. Commander Wu Guanhong of the Second Guerrilla District has ordered the guerrilla teams of Panyu and Huaxian to cut off their food supplies, so that they may collapse and be annihilated soon.</p>

<h3>The Korean Volunteer Corps in China</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] Since the War of Resistance, the enthusiastic sympathy and practical assistance of international people have become a great force in the determination of the Chinese people. From the perspective of international friends coming to China to participate in the battlefield, the facts are even more obvious. The Korean people, because of the cruel treatment they have suffered at the hands of the Japanese, have a particularly deep and sensitive understanding of the Japanese. Therefore, their sympathy and assistance to our War of Resistance are also particularly enthusiastic. The Korean Volunteer Corps, which grew up during the War of Resistance, has indelible merits on its merit list. At the current stage of the War of Resistance entering its second phase, launching a large-scale guerrilla war behind the enemy lines is our main military strategy in the future. The Korean Volunteer Corps is responsible for a part of the implementation of this strategy. The reporter specially went to visit Mr. Yang Minshan of the Propaganda Department of the Korean National Revolutionary Party to ask him about the latest situation of the Volunteer Corps. He said:</p>
<p>"The Korean Volunteer Corps belongs to the Korean National Revolutionary Party. It was established on the tenth section of last year. The person fully responsible for the team is Mr. Kim Ruoshan, the general secretary of the Korean National Revolutionary Party."</p>
<p>Then, he talked about the organization and work of the team, "Most of those who join the Volunteer Corps are members of the Korean National Revolutionary Party, and those who are responsible for leading various parts are mostly Korean people who have a revolutionary history or participated in the Northern Expedition of China in 1926, or have studied in China and received military training, and participated in the Chinese revolution, or have led student movements in their own country and have done many glorious things. Therefore, the leadership is relatively sound."</p>
<p>"They have not yet directly fought the Japanese. Their current task is divided into two parts, one for the country and one for foreign countries. For their own country, they are calling on and persuading the entire Korean nation to support and assist China's War of Resistance and strive for their own freedom and independence in China's War of Resistance. For China, they are promoting it to the Chinese people in various war zones and telling the Chinese people all the pain of being a slave of a fallen country. They tell the Chinese people the true face of the weak nations under the rule of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>Give the Chinese people the courage to resist. Judging from their experience of more than a year, the effect they have achieved is greater than that of other war zone service groups in terms of publicity."</p>
<p>"Secondly, they instigate Japanese soldiers to oppose the war. Because of their convenience in language, they do this work very well."</p>
<p>He listed several facts about how Japanese soldiers' opposition to the war was the result of the instigation of the Korean Volunteer Corps. Then, he said again, "In the past year or so, China has been fighting on the front. Therefore, they have not fulfilled the task of the Volunteer Corps. In the future, with the transformation of China's strategy, they will display the spirit of the Righteous Army Movement in the Ito Hirobumi era to fight to the death with the Japanese, because China's War of Resistance is not only seeking the liberation of the Chinese nation but also seeking freedom for the Korean compatriots."</p>
<p>"Where are the family members of the Korean Volunteer Corps members now?" The reporter was deeply afraid that the vicious claws of the Japanese would search for their innocent wives and children.</p>
<p>He replied: "They are all here."</p>
<p>"Then what do they rely on for their livelihood?"</p>
<p>"Currently, it is maintained by the Korean National Revolutionary Party, but this is not a long-term solution. We are planning to open up production enterprises and hope that Chinese industrialists and entrepreneurs will come out to help us!"</p>
<p>(Sent on January 7)</p>
<h3>Passing Through the × District</h3>
<p>— Pale Red</p>
<p>【Battlefield Sketches】Comrades accustomed to working in the rear often feel a vague sense of apprehension at the mention of "× District," as if it were a place one should not venture to easily, fearing unforeseen dangers at every turn. However, our journey from × County in southeastern Shanxi to Hekou near Taiyuan... passing through the × District, and reaching Hekou, the stronghold of our anti-Japanese guerrillas, has deepened our understanding of the war of resistance through our observations along the river.</p>
<p>The populace's understanding of the war of resistance has deepened, and they regard warfare as commonplace. Taking Yonghe, Daning, and Yangxian as examples, most of these cities have been burned by the Japanese ×, but strangely, the general public does not consider it a big deal, and cheerfully lives their lives during the war. When the × people arrive, they quickly lead their parents, wives, and children into hiding. Once the × people leave, the common people quickly move back, continuing their ordinary lives. Even though the × people have burned down shops and houses, merchants naturally set out their goods on the remaining steps. The old folks still lead their oxen to plow the fields. In the × District, we, fully armed, passed through. From morning till night, we scarcely saw any × people.</p>
<p>Two or three miles past Qingyuan Gaobai Town, the winding Tai-Fen Highway stretched before us, a major road used by the × people from Taiyuan to Fenyang. Due to its military transportation importance and to prevent sabotage by our guerrillas, the Japanese × constantly dispatched heavily armed patrols. Thus, the general populace felt that the Tai-Fen Highway was difficult to cross. Over a hundred of our armed comrades calmly approached the highway, filled with excitement, all ammunition at the ready, eager to fight to the death against the × people. Suddenly, the × people's tanks came speeding over, but the × soldiers, seeing our well-ordered ranks ready for battle, fearing that we would attack them, hastily reversed their armored vehicles.</p>
<p>On another occasion, as we were about to cross the Ping-Fen branch line, we had just reached the vicinity of a village. It was late at night, and the commotion of men and horses caused the village dogs to bark. The × people were no more than half a mile away, and they simultaneously detected us, their searchlights intensely scanning us. At that moment, our faces and clothes were as bright as if illuminated by moonlight, but the × people, fearing our attack, eventually fled far away.</p>
<p>The × people drive cars, tanks, and armored vehicles to transport supplies and ammunition, forcing them to travel the Tai-Fen Highway. Both sides of the road are completely covered with towering mountains. When the × people pass through here, if our troops lie in ambush on the mountaintops or in the green cornfields, they can inflict considerable losses on the × people. Therefore, our worker-armed self-defense forces often lie in wait on both sides of the highway to attack the × people. As a result, the × people's cars were burned, and their wool coats, leather shoes, warhorses, supplies, canned goods, etc., became our spoils of war.</p>
<p>In the × District, the orders and official documents of the puppet government were numerous, but when the orders reached the various villages, the village chiefs and heads of the townships ignored them. Although shameless elements such as the × people's traitors and lackeys exerted every effort to urge and intimidate by various means, they only managed to go through the motions. In reality, none of the measures implemented by the puppet organization were ever fully carried out. On the other hand, the enthusiasm and support of the people along the way for us fully demonstrated their hatred and animosity towards the × people and their love for the motherland. Wherever we passed, men, women, old and young, gathered along the streets to watch us, without the slightest fear. They busily boiled water, cooked food, and bought things for us, and even shared all the fruits, dates, and other snacks they had at home with us, hoping that we would eat them all up. But if the × people arrived today, the common people would all flee, taking all their food and supplies with them.</p>
<p>Near the cities occupied by the × people, although still under the leadership of our government, they inevitably suffer from the harassment and plunder of the × people. Therefore, the villagers in these places are constantly hoping for the arrival and protection of our guerrillas. If they encountered the arrival or passage of our army, the people would automatically act as sentries for our troops. If they spotted the arrival of the × people outside the village, they would quickly return to the village to report, instructing us on how to escape, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with the × people to prevent unexpected losses. In addition, when our guerrillas infiltrated the areas already occupied by the × people for reconnaissance or propaganda, there was no danger of being discovered by the × people, even if we were in the same village as the × people. Even if the × people lived in a house on the east side, we would live in the courtyard on the west side. Apart from the common people, neither the × people nor us knew of each other's presence. The cooperation between the military and the people has reached this point.</p>
<p>Having walked through six or seven county towns along the way, a gratifying phenomenon often excited and encouraged us. We saw the people's hatred for the ×× people expressed all over the streets and walls, and sometimes they would directly point out the crimes of the ×× people in various places. This was so exciting!</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the people groaning and writhing in the × District are the main part of our anti-× ranks. We must not overlook their anti-× activism, and we must not let go of the civil affairs work in the × District. Only by strengthening the work to win over the people in the × District can we expose all the conspiracies of the × people and achieve the initial victory of our guerrilla strategy.</p>

<h3>Our Army's Counteroffensive in Northern Hunan Achieves Success, River Defense in Western Shanxi Becomes Increasingly Stable, Second Phase of Supplementary Troops in Guangdong Set to Depart, People's Armed Forces in Shandong Reach 200,000</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Our Newspaper, 11th] Military news: The various battlefields remain quiet, with no major battles. The new cabinet has been reorganized and seems to be still considering new battle strategies. Therefore, most places are adopting a defensive posture. Our counteroffensives in Hunan and Shanxi are making good progress. Although Guangzhou is difficult to take immediately, the counties are definitely within our encirclement. The river defense in western Shanxi is becoming more secure. The enemy is repeatedly increasing troops in Shanxi and Suiyuan. The Northwest will become the center of major battles. The reorganization of our guerrilla forces in Hebei and Chahar will soon be completed, and their strength will be enhanced. The war situation in Shandong has recently become quiet. The organized people's armed forces in that province have reached 200,000.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming by Our Newspaper, 9th] The second phase of anti-Japanese supplementary troops in Yunnan is about to depart. Provincial Chairman Long Yun made a special trip to the concentration point yesterday to give a speech, encouraging their ambition to kill the enemy. He returned to the province on the evening of the 9th.</p>
<p>[Cable from Fancheng by Central News Agency, 9th] (1) There are more than 300 enemy troops and dozens of horses at Cangzibu in Huanggang. (2) There are also more than 200 enemy troops at Dujiapu and Qilongzhen in Songbu.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by Associated Press, 10th] Chinese military authorities say that China has been deployed in all war zones to prepare for the attack by the Japanese fascist Prime Minister Hiranuma's cabinet. In addition, China has set up two additional war zones in the interior, changed guerrilla tactics, and set up five major areas for troop concentration from Inner Mongolia to the border of Annam. In short, all military equipment has been enhanced to repel Hiranuma's attack.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhongshan by Our Newspaper, 11th] According to indirect front-line news from here, our artillery team and garrison on the south bank of the West River, Jinli, have repelled the invading enemy forces from Makou on the Pearl River Delta. On the 8th of this month, under the fierce artillery fire and dense machine gun fire of our side, the enemy troops suffered heavy casualties and significant losses. The enemy's offensive this time did not change its usual style of operation, first bombarding our positions with artillery fire, and then attempting to land. All the enemy's landing attempts failed because our front was equipped with machine guns and small steel cannon positions. The enemy commander then ordered 36 bombers to bomb our positions, dropping 100 bombs on Jinli Town, destroying many walls and civilian houses. However, our army suffered very few casualties. Also, the enemy navy attempted to land at Yulin Port on Hainan Island on the 7th, but was immediately fired upon by our garrison stationed on the island, and the enemy troops retreated without achieving their landing goal. It is speculated that the enemy's move was to test the strength of our defense forces. In addition, the enemy troops in Shilong and Humen have now been reinforced by new troops from Taiwan. The purpose of this is currently unknown.</p>
<p>[Cable from Guilin by Central News Agency, 10th] Recently, our troops have been constantly attacking the enemy in Yangmei and Sanjiang. The enemy was in a state of panic and collapse, retreating towards the Sanshui position.</p>
<p>[News from Hong Kong] The Taikoo ship Sichuan arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Haikou, carrying mostly tea. According to visitors from Haikou, the sea off Haikou was recently gathered by the enemy and the situation was quite tense, but by the 5th and 6th of this month, they had left one after another. On that day, an enemy aircraft carrier passed by the sea outside Haikou and sailed northeast, its whereabouts unknown. Enemy planes often fly over Haikou recently for reconnaissance, but the flight altitude is very high and barely visible. The citizens think that this move by the enemy planes is a common occurrence, so they are not panicked. The situation in Beihai is very stable, and shops have resumed business as usual. Goods from Hong Kong and Beihai are coming and going as usual.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Shanghai by Shanghai News Agency, 11th] It was learned from the Japanese side that from August to December, Japanese troops in the Shanghai-Nanjing area were attacked by guerrillas at least 309 times.</p>
<p>[Cable from Xingji by Mingeshe, 11th] In the counteroffensive against Jixian, our army occupied Liujiashan (5 miles south of the city) in the morning and fiercely bombarded the enemy inside the city. The allied forces are also approaching the mountains on the outskirts of the city. The enemy in the city is very panicked and is expected to recover the county within days. The enemy in Puxian has been pressured by our army and it is difficult to hold on for a long time.

<h3>Overseas Associations Request the Formation of Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army, Representatives Have Been Sent Back to China for Contact</h3>
<p>[News from Hong Kong] During this war of resistance, the overseas Chinese have been the most supportive of the central government, and the overseas Chinese merchants in various places have contributed the most money and manpower, all advocating fighting to the last person and the last soldier, and refusing to negotiate or surrender. Therefore, an increasing number of overseas Chinese youths from Nanyang have returned to China to serve, and many young people from far away have died on the battlefield. The sincerity and understanding of the overseas Chinese towards the motherland are admirable. It is a pity that the military authorities have never paid attention to finding ways to organize these children of overseas Chinese into an army, so that the overseas Chinese have no way to volunteer. Recently, overseas Chinese associations in various ports in Nanyang, such as the Saigon Overseas Chinese Yu Ren Society, the 7th Branch of the Vietnamese Xidi, the Australian Industrial Promotion Society, the Dutch East Indies Joint Association, the Burmese Overseas Chinese Frugality and National Salvation Association, and the European and American overseas Chinese organizations, all believe that it is necessary for overseas Chinese to apply to form an army. It is said that they have now initiated and sent representatives to visit a certain famous general who was formerly stationed at the Songhu Fortress (currently serving as the Guerrilla Commander of the West River XX District), requesting him to be responsible for planning and organizing the "Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army" or "Overseas Chinese Guerrilla Force" under the command of the commander. On the one hand, they are earnestly requesting the central military authorities to accept it. If the government permits it in the future and a certain army agrees, they will proceed to call on all overseas Chinese communities to return to China to eliminate the enemy. According to the leaders of overseas Chinese associations in various places, if the overseas Chinese army is trained by a certain anti-Japanese hero, they do not have to worry about funding, and even the issue of military equipment is easy to solve. They sincerely hope that the military authorities will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>The Collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and the Prospects for the Hiranuma Cabinet (Continued from Page 7 Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Li Wanjui</p>
<p>No change in the strategy towards China - the lesson of eight months of war has not awakened the Japanese warlords' dream of a "quick victory." From the first phase to the third phase, it always adopted a large-scale encirclement strategy, hoping to eliminate the main force of our army. Otherwise, the war would not end and the attempt to conquer China would not be realized. If the war is prolonged by one day, the difficulties will inevitably increase, the mire will become deeper and deeper, and the arrival of collapse will be faster. Therefore, the Japanese military action after the formation of the Hiranuma cabinet will inevitably be more tense, fierce, and cruel, which we must pay attention to. However, at the same time, the military will intensify its invasion, and the work of compromising and buying off those who are unclear about the situation and have wavering will will not stop. Because without peace talks, they cannot obtain the desired war results, and they cannot save the domestic crisis that is already erupting. We must thoroughly recognize why the Japanese warlords are keen on peace talks? Because their paper tiger can no longer scare people and has been exposed. Therefore, we must endure hardships and never be fooled by it, so that future generations will suffer endless pain.</p>
<p>Hiranuma is a former judicial official with a narrow perspective. What he can accomplish is already predictable. According to our speculation, what he wants to promote is only the above-mentioned four major points. However, the difficulties currently encountered by Japan in internal and foreign affairs cannot be overcome by a great politician with the ability to turn the tide. The difficulties that the new cabinet cannot overcome are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The scale of the war is expanding, and the front line is extended, which will inevitably increase the number of troops and military expenses. Judging from the current situation in Japan, the financial resources are exhausted, and the strength is almost exhausted to the point where no troops can be transferred. (2) International pressure is increasing day by day, and internal reform is difficult to achieve. The business index has declined since August last year. As the war is prolonged, the contraction will inevitably become more harmful. (3) The poverty of the Japanese people is caused by the aggressive war, not by the oppression of foreign countries. Therefore, what the Japanese public demands is a truce and internal reform. (4) The fascist regime is only darkness, not light, in the eyes of most of the Japanese impoverished class, and will cause international contempt and disgust, such as the United States and the Soviet Union, which will easily lead to the outbreak of internal revolution.</p>
<p>In short, since the Hiranuma cabinet is so weak and wants to solve the many problems facing Japan, we can conclude that it will inevitably face difficulties at every step and fall into a helpless situation. Therefore, it may be reorganized soon, but reorganization may not be able to increase its strength, may not be able to extend its fate, and may not be able to avoid the collapse of Japanese politics. - (The End)</p>

<h3>Yunnan During the Second Phase of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Kunming] The War of Resistance has entered its second phase, and Yunnan has become a transportation hub for sustained resistance. The Burma Road has replaced the Guangdong-Hankou Railway for national transportation. The construction of the two major railways in western Yunnan—the Yunnan-Burma Railway and the Sichuan-Kunming Railway—commenced with groundbreaking ceremonies on February 25th of last year, and is expected to be completed by the end of March of this year for surveying and alignment work. Yunnan province has grown from the War of Resistance. The preparations made by Yunnan province for the second phase of the War of Resistance are listed as follows.</p>
<p>Replenishment of Military Personnel</p>
<p>The provincial authorities, in order to replenish the military personnel for the War of Resistance, convened a conference and established a Regiment Training Office to coordinate the training of conscripts. Conscription and training sub-offices were set up in several counties to conduct inspections and training nearby. In preparation for participating in the second phase of the War of Resistance, Chairman Long ordered the Regiment Training Office to conscript 8,000 strong young men to concentrate in a certain location, to be inspected and accepted by Division Commander An, with a deadline for departure. As soon as the order was issued, volunteers eagerly registered. The sources of these 8,000 strong young men are: 200 from Daguan County, 300 from Yanlü County, 300 from Chengxing County, 1,300 from Zhenxiong County, 600 from Yiliang County (belonging to the First Training Sub-Office); 900 from Guangnan County, 200 from Qiubei County, 150 from Yanshan County, 450 from Xichou County, 400 from Wenshan County (belonging to the Sixth Training Sub-Office); 450 from Mengzi County, 150 from Jianjiu County, 300 from Kaiyuan County, 550 from Jianshui County, 100 from Quxi County, 400 from Shiping County, 100 from Tonghai County; 100 from Exi County, 200 from Huaning County, 100 from Eshan County (belonging to the Second Training Sub-Office); 150 from Jiangchuan County (belonging to the Seventh Training Sub-Office). They are now concentrated for training. The 3,000 conscripts from Daguan and other counties under the jurisdiction of the First Sub-Office are organized into the First, Second, and Third Battalions. The 2,000 conscripts from Guangnan and other counties under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Sub-Office are organized into the Fourth and Fifth Battalions. The Mengzi... under the jurisdiction of the Second Sub-Office and Seventh Sub-Office are expected to be inspected and accepted by Commander An within the timeframe for departure.</p>
<p>Training of Cadres</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the various cadres and strictly organize party and government agencies, the province entrusted the military branch school to be responsible for training military, police, party, and government personnel, establishing a wartime cadre training corps. It is divided into four major units. The first unit is an officer training class, registered with the Zhongsuifu. It is composed of idle military officers from Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and a part of land survey personnel. The second unit is a sergeant training class for combat cadres. The Training Office selects cadres from its subordinate units and selects local high school students who have received military training. The third unit is a police officer training class. The fourth unit is a military training class for party and government administrative personnel. The duration of study for each unit varies, but the training principles are based on the principles of sustained warfare.</p>
<p>Rich Resources Waiting to be Developed</p>
<p>Since the Central Committee's Western Yunnan Border Inspection Group came to Yunnan from Chongqing and set out along the Dian-Myanmar Highway, their investigation showed that the natural conditions in the border areas are excellent. The mountains and rivers are beautiful, the climate is mild, and the agricultural output is fertile. Crops such as rice, cotton, tea, tobacco, and fruits can be grown on a large scale. Animal husbandry and sericulture are also easy to develop. Mineral deposits are abundant. Currently, the local people use rudimentary technology and minimal labor to obtain rewards and enjoyment that exceed the needs of farmers in the interior. This absolutely affluent area is still sparsely populated. In this time of refugee relief and resettlement, this place is truly a paradise in the southwest.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the obstacles in the western Yunnan border region are "miasma" and the "Baiyi" people. After the inspection group returned, they believed that the above two problems could be solved. The so-called "miasma" is said to be not as serious as rumored. As long as attention is paid to sanitation, the elimination of miasma is definitely not difficult. As for the so-called "Baiyi" people, their nature is docile and they are easy to educate. Even the mountain tribes known for their ferocity can be guided by the government and not only be a great help in development, but also be trained into brave soldiers for the War of Resistance. In addition, with the availability of the Yunnan-Burma Highway for transportation, with vigorous management, it can turn the miasma into a paradise. The province's "Border Economic Investigation Group" will set off to the southwestern counties after the Relief Committee's inspection team. Its organization is composed of provincial government economic advisors who will raise funds. The expected departure period is three months. The scope of work includes surveying rural economies and natural resources in the southwestern counties, researching methods to increase production, and plans for investing in industries. The results of the survey and research will be used as a basis for future policy recommendations and will be made public to all sectors of society for investment in industries.</p>
<p>In short, Yunnan province has grown up from the War of Resistance. In order to strengthen the "material resources" in the sustained war, the western Yunnan border area, or the western Yunnan's rich resources, must be developed quickly. (Wanshan, January 4th)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Departs for Italy: Met Daladier in Paris Last Night, British and French Foreign Ministers to Hold Talks: Chamberlain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain left here this morning for Rome. A large crowd gathered to see him off at Downing Street. Chamberlain received many congratulatory letters an hour before his departure. Hundreds of people gathered at Victoria Station to bid farewell to the British delegation to Rome. The delegation includes Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and their advisors and secretaries. They left here at 11:00. Chamberlain did not speak at the station. A group of unemployed people also gathered in another corner of the station, carrying a black coffin and a banner that read, "The unemployed need appeasement, not Mussolini." The protesters advanced to the platform as the special train departed, but were stopped by the police. French Ambassador Corbin and the Italian chargé d'affaires were at the station to bid farewell to Chamberlain. As the train departed, people lined up at the station and cheered loudly. Chamberlain smiled and waved in acknowledgement. However, the unemployed protesters mocked Chamberlain. The coffin they carried was destroyed near the platform.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] According to French Foreign Ministry sources, the meeting between the British authorities and the French government leaders is entirely private. Chamberlain and Halifax will "have tea with Daladier and Bonnet" at the French Foreign Ministry. Chamberlain and others will arrive here at 6:00 p.m. and take a special express train to Rome at 7:30 p.m. The details of this meeting between the British and French authorities have already been discussed by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and the British Ambassador to France, Sir Eric Phipps.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet will travel to Geneva this Saturday to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. However, according to well-informed sources, his purpose is to meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax to discuss the results of the British-Italian talks in Rome.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Genoa, 10th] The central station here is currently being prepared for an official welcome. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will arrive at the station at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. The Italian government's special welcoming delegation will arrive at this station tonight to prepare. The train carrying the British Prime Minister will stop at Genoa station for ten minutes before continuing to Rome, arriving in the Italian capital at approximately 4:30 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
<p>Respecting the Promise of Western Territory: British Prime Minister Will Urge Italy to Fulfill It</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] According to the Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the main purpose of the Rome meeting is not negotiation, but exploration. Chamberlain and Halifax are going to Italy without any fixed ideas or agenda, and have not received any key points that Mussolini wants to discuss. However, it is expected that the Spanish war and French-Italian relations will be the main topics of discussion. Regarding French-Italian relations, London and Paris believe that British mediation is out of the question, as the problem can only be solved by France and Italy themselves. However, the improvement of the atmosphere between the two countries will be welcomed by Britain. France has made it clear that this should not be misunderstood by Britain. London and Paris have fully understood this entire matter. Regarding the Spanish war, the British Prime Minister and others will state Britain's view that Italy's promise to respect the territorial and administrative integrity of Spain must be translated into action. Until the plan to withdraw foreign volunteers proposed by the Non-Intervention Committee is fully implemented, the granting of belligerent rights is out of the question. In addition to the above two issues, the refugee problem and economic problems will also be discussed. The content of the talks will largely depend on what Mussolini raises. The British Prime Minister does not want any firm stipulations. His main purpose in making this trip is not this. However, the visit of the British Prime Minister and others to Rome should allow them to assess the future trends and policies of the Italian axis in the coming months.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Secretary: Urges the League of Nations to Take Action, US Decides to Adopt a Parallel Approach: Maintain Chinese Legal Tender, Oppose Japanese Destruction</h3>

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the British Cabinet has repeatedly discussed Japan's attitude towards China's open door policy. It has also been reported that London and Washington have fully and frankly exchanged views on the situation. Some observers here believe that London and Washington have reached the same conclusions from similar facts. Therefore, whatever steps are taken, the United Kingdom and the United States always maintain parallel measures. Although various rumors about maintaining Chinese legal tender have not yet been confirmed, maintaining Chinese legal tender is of great benefit to foreign businesses in China. Here, we strongly oppose the attempt to destroy the Chinese monetary system by using paper money issued by puppet organizations.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's National Defense Message: Requests Huge Funds to Build Aircraft, Aviation Advisory Committee Urges Improvement of Design Efficiency, British Aviation Delegation to Australia Has Important Mission</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Responsible officials announced that President Roosevelt will soon submit a national defense message to Congress, in which the part concerning the National Army advocates (1) allocating US$26,000,000 to the Army to add aircraft, so as to increase the total number of first-line aircraft to 5,300; (2) use US$41,361,000 to add 900 aircraft to the Navy, so that the total number of aircraft for both the Army and Navy will be increased to 10,000. From the perspective of increasing the first-line aircraft to 600, it is possible to be prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics recently reported to Congress that foreign countries are making every effort to expand military and commercial aircraft, which is a challenge to the leadership of the United States in aviation. The committee insisted that the efficiency of aircraft design is more important than the quantity of aircraft. From the standpoint of national defense, it is extremely important that the efficiency of American aircraft should be superior to or equal to that of its potential enemies. Therefore, the manufacture of aircraft should be increased, and huge sums should be allocated and engaged in aviation research and experimentation. According to reports, the famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh and aircraft inventor Lee de Forest are members of the committee.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] According to this agency's aviation correspondent, the British aviation inspection delegation to Australia has a very important mission. The aircraft manufactured in Australia are designed to be sufficient to defend Australia. In an emergency, it must also supply the needs of New Zealand and Singapore. Therefore, both ends of the British Empire's airline need a large number of aircraft to be produced.</p>
<h3>US National Defense Conference: Opposes the Expansion of the Pacific Naval Base, Suggestion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The US "National Conference on the Prevention of War" attacked the proposal to expand the Pacific naval base, and was particularly critical of defending Guam, believing that the US Navy intends to continue to be responsible for its national defense after Philippine independence. The meeting also pointed out that the content of Roosevelt's diplomatic policy includes: 1) establishing a naval base in the Pacific, 2) revising the Neutrality Act, and 3) punishing aggressor nations. The most important construction of the Luoshi's implementation of his Far East policy is the establishment of the Guam naval base. The distance from the jurisdiction to Hawaii is 3,337 miles, and on the channel from the island to the Philippines, there are Japanese mandated islands. In the Navy Department's report, it is necessary to turn Guam into a "strong forward fleet base." Xiang Tanbai claimed that after Guam is defended, the Philippines can be protected from any country's infringement. The General Assembly pointed out, "The danger of this kind of action is obviously visible, because the area of naval operations is more distant from our country's mainland, thus increasing the risk of conflict, and at a minimum, the Navy will assume that the government is responsible for the national defense of the Philippines. The cost of the Guam naval base has not been published, but naval personnel believe that at least 200,000,000 coins are required to make Guam defensible. Furthermore, the United States Navy recommends the establishment of 41 bases, 15 of which must be established immediately and cannot be delayed. The emphasis on the Pacific proves that the US Navy believes that in the Far East, it will be inevitable to compete with Japan." The General Assembly also stated, "President Roosevelt's speech at the opening of Congress was to test the nature of domestic public opinion before revealing the detailed plan. The first point is a proposal related to national defense, because the government feels that the people are prepared to accept the expansion plan of the army and navy. However, it is doubtful whether the government will propose proposals related to the Neutrality Act and sanctions during the Congress meeting."</p>
<h3>Czech-Hungarian Conflict Resolved Completely: Establishment of Neutral Zone on the Border, Exchange of Prisoners by Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Prague, 10th] The military conflict between the Czech Republic and Hungary that occurred on the border last Friday has been completely resolved with the decision to establish a neutral zone yesterday. The commanders of the two countries' troops at the scene of the incident have accepted the preliminary conditions, which will then be approved by the two governments. The neutral zone will be established at 8:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month. After that, armed forces from either side will not be able to garrison. The captured prisoners will also be exchanged today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 9th] The Czech Republic and Hungary have agreed to establish a neutral zone in the Mukachevo region to end the border conflict last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Potential for Conflict Between Germany and the United States: US Foreign Affairs Association Believes Greatly Increased, South America Prevents National Socialism</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] The Foreign Affairs Association recently published an article stating that since the Munich Agreement, the potential for conflict between Germany and the United States has greatly increased. Since that time, Germany has no longer attacked the Soviet Union, France, and Czechoslovakia, but has focused on attacking the United Kingdom and the United States. The country's attitude is aimed at controlling the world, which may lead to conflicts with the United States in South America and with the United Kingdom in Africa. These conflicts will not necessarily be armed conflicts, but Germany can use threats, propaganda, and various methods of economic expansion to dispute with the United Kingdom and the United States. The country has already used this method to annex Austria and the Sudetenland without bloodshed. Why not apply it to South America? The conclusion is that the United States is now preparing to strengthen the defenses of Latin American countries to prevent the intrusion of National Socialism.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Completes Investigation of Nationalist Air Raids in Spain; Indiscriminate Bombing Endangers Civilians; Britain Negotiates Release of Arrested Consul</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 9th] Regarding the bombing of Spanish Republican government cities by Nationalist military aircraft, the League of Nations sent a commission to the Republican territory to conduct an investigation. Several copies of its report have been delivered to the League of Nations, the content of which is as follows: (1) During the bombing of Figueras by Nationalist military aircraft on November 14th of last year, there was only one military target in the area, so it should be considered the bombing of an undefended city. (2) During the bombing of Barcelona by Nationalist military aircraft on October 21st of last year, although the target was said to be the docks, the bombing was indiscriminate and endangered the safety of most civilians. (3) During the bombing of Tarragona by Nationalist military aircraft on November 23rd of last year, the damage was extremely severe.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Barcelona, 10th] Five rebel aircraft bombed the port here last night, killing six people and injuring eleven. The extent of property damage is currently unknown.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 10th] According to Italian newspapers this morning, the Italian Air Force, fighting on the side of the Spanish rebels, has shot down a total of 837 government aircraft, while Italian aircraft losses are only 85.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Burgos, 10th] Two roads with the Spanish government location Barcelona as their gathering point have now been cut off by the rebels. The rebels are advancing rapidly, with one unit based in Lleida, having occupied the important town of Mora la Nueva, fourteen miles to the east. Government troops are retreating towards Siétamo and have blown up bridges along the way, but the rebels immediately repaired them and advanced towards Siétamo and the Quinto area.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The British government has instructed the British Chargé d'Affaires in Burgos to negotiate with the Spanish rebel authorities for the release of Mr. Collier, the British Vice-Consul in San Sebastián, who has been arrested, and to thoroughly investigate the charges against Mr. Collier by the rebels.</p>

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Chen Bijun's Activities</h3>
<p>This newspaper was the first to publish the news of Wang Jingwei's wife, Chen Bijun, arriving in Hong Kong. This has now been confirmed by various sources. In the past, Chen Bijun bore a significant responsibility for Wang's several attempts to instigate political changes, which has long been an open secret. This time, Wang has betrayed the motherland and his whereabouts are secretive, while Chen Bijun is running around actively. We cannot but call on all relevant parties to be vigilant and pay attention. Furthermore, we would like to advise Chen Bijun: you once saved Wang's life, which only made you a meritorious figure in the Wang family, but Wang's concentration of power led to his downfall and he has become a sinner to the entire Chinese nation! We dare not expect you to follow the example of prominent figures in various industries, but at the very least we hope you preserve the minimum "integrity" of your husband and take good care of him while he is "sick" abroad!</p>
<h3>Winning Over Allied Troops in the Enemy Camp</h3>
<p>The main conditions for our victory in the War of Resistance are (1) China's progress, (2) the enemy's difficulties, and (3) international assistance. We are striving for progress in our own political and military affairs and for the success of international assistance, while also increasing the enemy's difficulties. However, we must not forget to win over allied troops against the enemy in the enemy camp!</p>
<p>Some people believe that trying to win over allied troops in the enemy camp is completely a fantasy. In fact, this statement only shows that they do not understand the significance of this Sino-Japanese War. Because this Japanese war of aggression against China is, on the one hand, a war of absolute opposition between the entire Chinese nation, and on the other hand, a war of opposition against the interests of the entire Japanese people and the Taiwanese people. Our War of Resistance is not only a war for China's own liberation, but also an anti-fascist war, which will inevitably help the Japanese and Taiwanese people to be liberated from fascist oppression.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese aggressors are stepping up their march towards fascist autocracy. The conflict between the invading warlords and the people is becoming more and more serious. The opportunity for us to win over allied troops in the enemy camp is maturing day by day. We must work as closely as possible to win over puppet troops to revolt and enemy troops to defect!</p>
<h3>The Development of the Situation in Southeastern Europe</h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondent for this newspaper in London) Uncle</p>
<p>The development of the situation in Southeastern Europe has a significant impact on the overall situation of the world, even of Europe. Its scope of influence is mainly on the relations between the major European powers. The upcoming Rome talks between Chamberlain and Mussolini are based there. As far as is known, Southeastern Europe is one of the most important items. Therefore, on the eve of these Rome talks, I think it is necessary to briefly report on the recent development of the situation. The term "Southeastern Europe" here refers to the five countries of the Balkan Peninsula, plus Poland, the European part of Turkey, and Hungary, etc.</p>
<p>When we talk about the recent development of the situation in Southeastern Europe, the first thing that catches our attention is France's temporary withdrawal from the Southeastern European stage after the Munich Conference; the second thing that catches our attention is Germany's resounding expansion of power; the third is Italy's anxiety and unease; then comes Britain's activities; and finally, it should be Soviet Russia's recent diplomatic offensive in that area. Although the specific results for the future are not yet known, the possible significant results of the development trend of the current situation are: (1) In the case of Germany's complete victory, it would completely become its vassal; (2) In the case of Italy's complete victory, except for Albania, which would still maintain its vassal status as before, the rest of the areas would be divided equally between Germany and Italy. This equal division relationship would then be mediated by Britain, playing the role of a mediator; (3) In the case of Britain's complete victory, it would take advantage of the friction between Germany and Italy to break up the "Berlin-Rome Axis" and limit German activities to Poland and Hungary in the east, especially to prevent any major power from extending its influence to Turkey's Dardanelles Strait; Finally, assuming that Soviet Russia's diplomatic offensive is completely victorious, it would be the formation of a group of Southeastern European countries, with the Soviet Union as its background, to resist any invaders from the West. This is the general outline of the recent strategies of the five major powers of France, Germany, Italy, Britain, and Russia surrounding Southeastern Europe. Now, let's talk about Southeastern Europe itself.</p>
<p>Poland</p>
<p>Poland, which has always been regarded as a supporting actor in the German-Italian group, unexpectedly joined hands with Soviet Russia after the Munich Conference. The degree of this collaboration has been further consolidated after the recent signing of the "no more war" declaration between Germany and France. Because, as far as is now known, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was staying in Paris, he assured French Foreign Minister Bonnet that Germany's main "interest" in the future was in the East, not in the French territory in the West, so he asked France to rest assured and requested France to give a promise, that is, France would no longer interfere in Germany's eastward development in the future. When France was unable to take care of herself, of course, Daladier and Bonnet had only one way to obey Germany's will. However, when this news was learned by Poland, it immediately keenly realized that Germany's so-called eastward route had three meanings for Poland itself: (1) demanding the return of the "Polish Corridor"; (2) requiring Poland to cede territory for Germany's development route to Soviet Ukraine, completely isolating Poland from the countries of Southeastern Europe; (3) transferring the territory Poland had obtained from Czechoslovakia to Germany. However, Poland thinks that Germany will definitely make demands on her in the near future. If Poland does not agree, then it will definitely incite the minority German nation in Poland to demand so-called "autonomy"; if necessary, Germany will use force to "liberate" this minority nation. Therefore, in order to resist this danger, Poland's first step is to strengthen the hand-in-hand relationship between Soviet Russia and Poland, and the second step is to send 50,000 troops to be stationed on Poland's western border in order to cope with a possible German invasion.</p>
<p>If Germany presses further, then the friendly relationship between Soviet Russia and Poland will be advanced to a military alliance in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Turkey</p>
<p>After Kemal's death, the major influence on Turkey's diplomacy was the loss of a pro-British leader. Therefore, within a short period of time, Britain's leading position in Turkey's diplomacy was shaken. Therefore, Germany, Britain, and Russia simultaneously began diplomatic activities towards Turkey.</p>
<p>Britain's current attitude is that Chamberlain believes that there is no need to oppose Germany's economic activities in Turkey; but important German political activities should be limited to "eastward" countries such as Poland and Hungary, and should not "southward" to Turkey and Romania. Especially in order to maintain the transportation line between Britain and India, Britain absolutely cannot allow any major power to extend its influence to the Dardanelles Strait. However, on the German side, in addition to economic activities, the most important goal is precisely to obtain Turkey's consent in order to strengthen its position in the Dardanelles Strait. In the event of war, it can advance north to attack Soviet Russia from the Black Sea, and south to attack the transportation line between Britain and India. The Soviet Union, of course, absolutely cannot sit idly by and watch Turkey join the sphere of German influence.</p>
<p>According to the official statement of Turkey, its foreign policy in the future is consistent with Kemal's era; however, the trend of changing from being unilaterally pro-British to maneuvering among Britain, Germany, and Russia in order to enhance its own position is very obvious.</p>
<p>Hungary</p>
<p>Hungary, which is generally considered to have long been destined to be a German protectorate, does not think so in the minds of its own rulers. On the eve of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, its rulers cleverly avoided the danger of Czechoslovakia being annexed by Germany first; afterwards, they used Italy's support to alleviate Germany's annexation attempts. Now, in order to prevent future dangers, it is constantly planning to create a common border between the two countries with Poland on the disputed territory in order to jointly cope with Germany's future annexation. Therefore, it demanded that Czechoslovakia cede Ruthenia. This demand caused major dissatisfaction with Germany; however, because it had Italy's support, Germany could not openly oppose it. Therefore, Hitler reflected the current rulers of Czechoslovakia and asked Britain and France to fulfill their promise to jointly guarantee the new borders of Czechoslovakia. Here, Chamberlain did not hesitate to lift a finger to win Hitler's favor, so he immediately prevented the realization of Hungary's demands and declared that Britain and France would absolutely safeguard Czechoslovakia's new borders.</p>
<p>After the failure of the plan to establish a common border with Poland, Hungary immediately turned its eyes to the south. Now, it is considering whether it should form an alliance with Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Greece, etc., with Soviet Russia as its background, to jointly resist all territorial aggression, and what is being considered as a prerequisite is that Otto Dada become the Emperor of Hungary. On the one hand, because he is Hitler's mortal enemy, on the other hand, it is hoped that the alliance will be established through the connection between the royal families of the above-mentioned countries through royal relations.</p>
<p>Balkan Peninsula</p>
<p>Among the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, Romania has been the most active recently. Not long ago, Romanian King Carol traveled busily between countries such as Britain and Germany. The results he obtained were: first, a credit loan from Britain; second, thanks to the arrangement of Chamberlain and Halifax, he will have formal talks with Italy's Mussolini in the not-too-distant future; third, in Germany, he was pressured by Hitler to release Codreanu, the leader of the organization similar to the National Socialist Party of Romania, the so-called "Iron Guard". However, when Carol returned to Romania, he immediately executed Codreanu and completely disbanded the National Socialist-style organization. In addition, in countries such as Albania and Bulgaria, pro-German reactionary organizations are also actively operating, and even Mussolini feels uneasy.</p>
<p>Because of various common interests, the general staffs of Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia secretly held an important meeting in Athens, the capital of Greece, more than ten days ago, with Greek General Papagos presiding over everything. The most important resolutions are: 1. Further strengthen mutual military assistance; 2. Mutually guarantee the complete independence of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, I would like to repeat one sentence: All those who care about the future destiny of Southeastern Europe should pay close attention to the upcoming Rome talks between Chamberlain and Mussolini.</p>

<h3>The Relief Federation Held Its 31st General Meeting Yesterday; A Heated Debate Erupted Over the Request for Relief Funds from Boluo; Pan Fan'an Pleaded for Expedited Allocation on the Grounds That Disaster Relief Was Like Fighting Fire; Li Jianfeng Insisted on Following Precedent; A Compromise Was Reached</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Joint Committee of All Circles for Relief of South China Refugees held its 31st meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday on the fourth floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Those present included Lu Fu and Li Huiquan of the Chinese Arts Association, Li Jianfeng of the Journalists Association, Lin Zengsheng of Tung Wah Hospital, Lin Ciming of the Kwong Luen Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Xingchi of the Sun Wui Commercial Society, Liu Qingxuan of the Women's War Relief Association, Pan Fan'an and Lu Guomian of the Chung Sing Benevolent Society, Li Bingsen of the Panyu Commercial Society, He Xiangning of the Women's Comfort Association, Chen Zhongchi of the Zhongshan Commercial Society, Mao Heyuan of the Central Relief Commission, Liao Jian of the Yee On Company, Pan Bingji of the Po On Commercial Society, Su Anping of the Women's New Movement Association, Xie Yaoxiang of the Tung Koon Commercial Society, Hong Liang of the Cattle and Sheep Industry General Union, Huang Ruiquan of the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association, Chen Yanfu of the Theater Workers' General Union, Nanfeng Society Yu, Lin Guangfu of the Hong Kong Printing Industry Workers' Union, Lin Shouqi of the Youth Overseas Chinese Ambulance Team, Liu Yingtian of the Hong Kong Tailors' Union, Liang Ruikun of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association, Huang Lianfu of the Chong Zheng Commercial Society, Jian Chinnan of the Miscellaneous Timber Merchants Association, Su Chaojian of the Meat Industry Commercial Society, Shan Dexin of the YWCA, and Ye Lanquan of the Manufacturers' Association. Lu Fu, representing the Planning Group, chaired the meeting, and Shi Bohan recorded the minutes. During the meeting, a fierce debate erupted over the case of the Chuan Lo Relief Association requesting funds for relief. At the same time, the previous meeting resolved to allocate 5,000 yuan of national currency to be discussed by the Panyu Commercial Society and the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association for disaster relief. However, the Panyu Commercial Society only allocated 3,000 yuan for relief in northern Panyu, and the remaining 2,000 yuan was reserved for relief elsewhere, which also sparked a debate. Excerpts from the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>General Affairs and Finance Reports</p>
<p>1. The General Affairs Group reported on: 1. Received letters from the Western District Six Districts Joint Relief Office for Refugees, the Anti-Drug Promotion Association, the Boluo Refugee Relief Association, and the Dongbao Hui Border Area Guerrilla Brigade, one official letter each, and one official letter from the Relief Department. 2. Reported on the resolutions of the Standing Committee meeting. (2) The Finance Group reported (from January 5th to January 9th, 1939): Hong Kong dollars received included 100 yuan from the Causeway Bay Da Hang North Point Joint Relief Fundraising Association, and 3 yuan from Yiyou Xuan. The total received this week was 103 yuan. The total received to date is 102,421.63 yuan. Expenditures included 13,000 yuan for the General Affairs Department. The total expenditure this week was 13,000 yuan. The total expenditure to date is 82,829.25 yuan. The balance between income and expenditure is 19,592.38 yuan at the Bank of China (including 3 yuan at the accounting office of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce). The national currency received included 100 yuan from Zeng Guihe and 95 yuan from the Polly Phemus dockworkers. The total received this week was 195 yuan. The total received to date is 83,555.37 yuan. National currency expenditures included 5,000 yuan for the General Affairs Department. The total expenditure this week was 5,000 yuan. The total expenditure to date is 22,480 yuan. The balance between income and expenditure is 61,075.37 yuan at the Guangdong Provincial Bank (with 195 yuan check deposited in the accounting office of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce). The reports of the other groups were omitted.</p>
<p>Discussion Items; Five Items Resolved</p>
<p>Discussion items: (1) The total income and expenditure of the association's disaster relief funds for the 27th year (1938) need to be announced urgently. The relevant groups should report in detail as soon as possible. It is proposed to send letters to the groups and organizations receiving disaster relief funds from the association, asking them to report in writing in detail to the association before February 1st to clear the procedures and make it public. The resolution was passed. (2) It is proposed that in the future, for domestic disaster relief that the association is capable of handling, the association's relief group will directly or assist in handling it. If the association is not capable of handling it, it will entrust trustworthy organizations in various counties or the disaster relief groups requesting assistance to distribute the relief funds on their behalf. They must report the disaster relief situation and the amount of income and expenditure to the association for verification. The funds will be paid by the General Affairs Group. The resolution was passed. (3) The Boluo Relief Association requested funds for disaster relief. The resolution was to hand it over to the investigation group for investigation. Then, the general meeting authorized the standing committee to convene a temporary standing committee meeting to decide on the amount of funds to be allocated, and submit it to the next general meeting for ratification (this resolution was passed, limited to this time only, and cannot be used as a precedent next time). (4) The Dongbao Hui Border Area Guerrilla Brigade requested a monthly subsidy of 100 Hong Kong dollars and a batch of cotton clothing and medicines. The resolution was to hand it over to the investigation group for investigation, and then discuss it at the next meeting. (5) Regarding the association's allocation of 5,000 yuan of national currency to the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association, how to proceed with the case was resolved by asking the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association and the Panyu Commercial Society to list the required items, which would be purchased by the association. Those that cannot be purchased in Hong Kong will be entrusted to the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association to carry out disaster relief on their behalf.</p>
<p>Heated Debate Erupts Over Boluo's Request for Funds</p>
<p>According to the Zhen Lianhui (Relief Federation) yesterday, when discussing the Boluo Relief Association's request for funds for disaster relief, the situation was extremely tense. The motions were changed several times and were almost impossible to pass. According to past precedents for requesting funds for disaster relief, no matter which organization requested the general meeting to allocate funds for relief, the procedure was for the general meeting to hand it over to the investigation group as usual to investigate the severity of the disaster, the amount of funds needed, and whether the requesting organization was trustworthy and reportable to the general meeting. Then, the general meeting would decide on the amount of funds to be allocated. At the same time, if the general meeting was capable of handling it, the general meeting would send its own personnel to handle it. Otherwise, it would be entrusted to the requesting organization to handle it on its behalf. Yesterday, in the case of Boluo's request for funds, Pan Fan'an, considering that disaster relief was like fighting fire, advocated that the amount of disaster relief funds be set immediately, and the investigation group would be responsible for consulting the Huiyang Commercial Society, and then handed over to the Boluo Relief Association to carry out disaster relief. After the motion was passed, Li Jianfeng of the Journalists Association suddenly firmly raised an objection, believing that it violated past precedents. As a result, the other parties expressed their opinions and the debate was extremely fierce. At that time, the representatives present expressed sympathy for the refugees in Boluo. Although the chairman proposed a re-vote, the original motion was still maintained. Then, Liu Qingxuan, the representative of the Women's War Relief Association, proposed a compromise method to hand over the case to the investigation group. After the investigation group could investigate and confirm the case within two or three days, a temporary meeting of the standing committee would be convened to discuss the disaster relief plan, and then submit it to the next general meeting for ratification. Only then was it unanimously passed, but a lot of time had already been debated. It is hoped that in the future, the association will clearly stipulate the precedents for requesting funds for disaster relief (such as detailed rules), otherwise, there will be more debates and disputes in the future, and the representatives present will not know what to do.</p>
<p>Opinions Also Differ on Relief in Northern Panyu</p>
<p>Also, when discussing the second case, Li Jianfeng of the Journalists Association also raised inquiries about the previous motion record, allocating 1,000 yuan of national currency to relieve the refugees in the disaster area of northern Panyu. The representative of the Panyu Association gave a reply, followed by a report from Lin Peisheng of the Relief Group, undertaking the task of investigating and relieving the refugees in northern Panyu under the order of the general meeting. He said that the 30th meeting of the general meeting had resolved to allocate 1,000 yuan of national currency and hand it over to the Relief Group to handle the relief of refugees in northern Panyu. He immediately consulted with the representatives of the Overseas Panyu Association and the representatives of northern Panyu on the relief plan, and the representatives of northern Panyu agreed to transfer all the relief funds of 5,000 yuan to the Panyu Association to receive and handle. Then, the representative of the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association expressed agreement with Lin's report and said that the Panyu Association had transferred 3,000 yuan of national currency to the Association from the funds. Then, the representatives present expressed their opinions, which were different. The chairman then summarized the opinions of the people and re-voted on the case. The resolution was to allocate 5,000 yuan of national currency to relieve the refugees in Panyu and northern Panyu. As for the required items, please ask the representatives of northern Panyu and the Panyu Association to list the list, which will be purchased by the general meeting from the funds.</p>

<h3>Bandits Rampant in Baoan County Near Hong Kong Border, Preying on Refugees Under Pretense of Inspection and Robbery</h3>
<p>Recently, in the Dongjiang area, our forces launched a major counter-offensive, and the enemy troops are retreating in disarray. Baoan, Boluo, Huizhou, and their affiliated areas are being successively recovered by our forces. In recent days, refugees who had come to Hong Kong, believing that these counties were now in our hands and the areas had returned to peace, have been leaving Hong Kong to return to their hometowns. Many of them were carrying valuables, which attracted the attention of traitors and bandits, who seized the opportunity to rob them. Yesterday, a villager from Li Lang village in Baoan County came to Hong Kong and told reporters that bandits are extremely rampant in the Li Lang, Buji, and Shatou areas. They operate in groups of three to five, lurking along various transportation routes, falsely claiming to be members of certain guerilla teams, self-defense corps, or military units, under the pretext of body searches and inspections, seizing the opportunity to rob people. In the past half-month, countless refugees returning from Hong Kong have been robbed, even of their clothes, shoes, and hats. The cries of the people echo along the roads, creating a very tragic scene. Those fleeing from the mainland to Hong Kong who pass through the area are also frequently targeted. Currently, Tan Sui, the Deputy Commander of the Eastern Garrison, has dispatched a large detachment of armed police to strictly maintain security and defense. He advises those fleeing to Hong Kong or returning from Hong Kong to be vigilant.</p>

<h3>Jinshan Steamer Sails for Province This Morning</h3>
<p>The Jinshan steamer of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Steamboat Company is scheduled to sail for "the Province" (Guangdong) at 8:00 AM this morning. The Portuguese steamer "Pearl" will also begin running between "the Province" and Macau tomorrow, with two trips per week. It is said that the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong will send a special commissioner to Macau to handle all matters.</p>
<h3>Intense Solar Flare Eruptions, Prolonged Drought in Hong Kong is an Effect</h3>
<p>Last year was the second driest year in Hong Kong since weather records began. This drought condition has not yet improved. Since the beginning of last month until today, there have been only a few light rains. According to recent observations by meteorologists, this abnormal atmosphere is due to intense solar flare eruptions, what is known in meteorology as sunspots. The area of the solar flare eruption that caused this drought, though appearing as a small spot through a telescope, is actually 650 million square miles, almost three and a half times the area of the Earth.</p>
<h3>British Bank Announces Closure, Chartered Bank to Take Over its Business, Managers of Both Banks Issue Joint Announcement</h3>

Recently, due to the Chartered Bank purchasing all of its shares, the British Bank has decided to close on February 1st, and its business will be taken over by the Chartered Bank. The managers of both banks jointly published an advertisement in the South China Morning Post yesterday, stating that the British Bank will close on January 31, 1939, and its business will be taken over by the Chartered Bank thereafter. All correspondence or inquiries should be directed to the Chartered Bank at 3 Des Voeux Road Central. Accounts with the British Bank will be handled as usual.</p>
<h3>Refugee Industrial Cooperative Officially Established Yesterday, Begins Accepting 50 Members</h3>
<p>The Refugee Industrial Cooperative, co-organized by the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association and the Women's Christian Temperance Union, officially began accepting 50 selected refugees yesterday, and also held an inauguration ceremony. Those presiding over the ceremony included Mrs. Li Fong (President), Wang Liming, Mrs. Guo Linzhou, and more than ten others. The president gave an inaugural address, stating that the cooperative is now officially accepting the selected refugees and holding its inauguration ceremony. The purpose of the cooperative is solely to accommodate unemployed women. The current acceptance of 50 people is due to economic constraints, so this number is temporarily accepted. In the future, if finances are sufficient, more refugees will be accepted. It is hoped that all sectors of society will donate to the cooperative so that more homeless refugees can be accommodated, and that all sectors will work hard at work, etc. After the speech, Mrs. Guo gave a speech, and Liu Liming gave an encouraging speech. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Youth Fundraising Committee Closes Mitten Drive, Receives Over $400</h3>
<p>The China Youth Relief Committee recently launched a second campaign to collect cold-weather mittens for the 19th Route Army. After a week of effort, the results are excellent. The committee's fundraising methods involve dividing members into several teams by district, each with ten members, led by a team leader elected from the team. Each team is named after a county or place in the occupied Guangdong Province. The team and individual that raise the most money receive prizes. The Guangzhou team raised $64.65, the Foshan team $49.55, the Shiqi team $75.32, the Huangpu team $96.90, the Jiujiang team $134.10, and the Conghua team $36.60, for a total of $452.52.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's War on Rats: 1.5 Million Rats Killed in Eight Years</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's campaign to eradicate rats has been going on for decades. It took a full thirty years for this campaign to produce significant "battle results," so that rats would no longer pose a threat to the population. However, this campaign continues to this day!</p>
<p>From 1930 to the present, more than 1.5 million rats have died under the extermination efforts of the Sanitary Department. However, I can tell you that the rat population will not be eliminated.</p>
<p>Half a Dollar Reward for Killing a Rat</p>
<p>A pair of rats can produce 1,200 offspring in twelve months. The current rat population in Hong Kong is probably two or three times greater than the human population.</p>
<p>In the history of rat eradication in Hong Kong, there is an interesting historical fact. It is said that the Hong Kong government implemented a "red bounty" policy for rats. Killing a rat and sending it to the Sanitary Department earned a reward of half a dollar. However, because the number of rats was too large, the policy was eventually cancelled. It is said that at that time, some people took advantage of the opportunity to import dead rats from Guangzhou and Macau to sell to the government!</p>
<p>A History of Plague Terror</p>
<p>Why is the Hong Kong government so strict about rats? Most long-time residents of Hong Kong are familiar with the story, because in 1894, a great plague occurred in the Far East. This plague originated in Yunnan, spread to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to India and other ports in the Far East. 100,000 people died in Guangzhou, 5,000 in Hong Kong, and India was particularly affected, with a death toll of tens of millions over the years. After that year, Hong Kong rigorously implemented a rat control campaign, with "rat traps hanging on lamp posts" as its starting point. After thirty years of extermination, the plague gradually decreased. In 1929, there was only one case, and since 1930, not a single case has been found. Hong Kong's rat eradication campaign can be considered a success!</p>
<h3>Foreign Reporter Talks About Guangzhou, Bandit Tax Collectors Everywhere, Gambling Dens and Loud Games of Chance Everywhere</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Rehabilitation Association held a luncheon at the Hong Kong Hotel yesterday at 1:00 PM. In addition to dozens of members of the association, there were also many members and guests from various places, totaling about 80 people. The atmosphere was quite lively. After the meal, Dr. Li Shufen, the chairman, introduced the guests and read letters of congratulations from Shanxi, Jinshan, and other places to the association on its anniversary and New Year's greetings. Then, he introduced the foreign journalist Mr. Wilson to speak. Mr. Wilson had traveled extensively throughout China in the past three years. When Guangzhou fell, he stayed there for a long time before coming to Hong Kong. He was asked to speak about his experiences coming from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, and it was hoped that Mr. Wilson would provide the audience with a concrete description of his journey. Next, Mr. Wilson rose to speak, stating that he had left Guangzhou three weeks ago, taking the route through Shiqi to Macau. The details he described were largely the same as those reported in the newspapers, so he would not repeat them. Regarding the widespread rumors of gambling dens run by gangsters in Guangzhou, Mr. Wilson confirmed them, saying that wherever gangsters gather, there are loud games of chance, similar to the licentiousness of Las Vegas in Hollywood, USA. Furthermore, on the entire journey from Guangzhou to Shiqi, which was under the control of Japanese soldiers, he encountered "bandit tax collectors" everywhere, levying a "war tax," which was an unheard-of imposition. After the speech, Dr. Li Shufen, the chairman, invited Mr. Shen Hanyang, the chief editor of the English-language South China Morning Post and a member of the association, to give a thank-you speech. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Modern Woman Commits Suicide by Poisoning on Fifth Floor of America Hotel, Found Dead Next Morning After One Night's Stay, Cause Unknown</h3>
<p>A modern woman committed suicide by poisoning yesterday morning at the America Hotel on Des Voeux Road Central. The deceased was a young woman of only eighteen years old. She checked into the hotel the night before and was found dead in bed yesterday morning. Police detectives are currently investigating the cause of her suicide. The body has been sent to the mortuary for autopsy. Upon receiving the news, reporters went to the scene to investigate.</p>
<p>Checked in Alone</p>
<p>The suicide scene was the room 505 on the fifth floor. According to the staff on the fifth floor, the deceased checked into the hotel at 6:20 PM the night before, wearing a grey-blue patterned short-sleeved cheongsam and a black jacket. She had no luggage. After checking in, she went straight to the fifth floor and stayed in room 505, which costs $2.70 per day. The deceased paid a deposit of $2.75. In the hotel registry, she filled in the name "Li," 18 years old, from Guangdong, having come from Hong Kong. The deceased was beautiful and dressed very fashionably. Judging by her behavior, she seemed to be a young girl, but according to her registration, she seemed to be a married woman. The deceased's demeanor was normal when she checked in, and she did not go out after checking in. The poison she took seemed to have been prepared beforehand.</p>
<p>Found Poisoned</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM yesterday morning, the male and female attendants on the floor were cleaning the rooms. The cleaning lady wanted to bring tea to room 505, so she called from outside the door, but there was no response. The cleaning lady then knocked hard on the door, but there was still no answer. The cleaning lady initially thought that the guest was sleeping soundly, so she knocked repeatedly, but there was still no sound. Realizing that something was wrong, she reported it to the manager. The manager opened the door. The deceased was lying on the bed, facing outwards. He shook her body and called her name several times, but there was no response. Upon closer inspection, he saw foam flowing from her mouth and nose, and her face was turning black. He felt her pulse and found it very weak. The manager saw three teacups, a jar of hair cream, and a lot of opium on the dresser. The teacups were full of smoke stains, so he knew that she had taken poison.</p>
<p>Found Possessions</p>
<p>He immediately notified the police station. The police station notified the ambulance to come to the scene, intending to send the deceased to the hospital, but she died en route. The body was sent to the mortuary. The police also came to investigate, questioning the attendants on the floor. A white handkerchief and a package wrapped in newspaper, seemingly a suicide note or photos, were found on the dresser. The cause of the deceased's suicide is currently unknown.</p>

<h3>Another New Contingent Marching Towards the Motherland's Front Lines: The Fourth Service Corps of the Student Relief Association Sets Out to Serve the Country</h3>
<p>"Countless fine sons and daughters of China, write history with blood like a tide," these are the words of Mr. Tian Han.</p>
<p>In the motherland, in the exchange of blood and fire, under the fierce attacks of bombs, in the tragedy of human annihilation, countless young people of the new China are fighting arduously, determined to sacrifice their blood and flesh to participate in this sacred war of self-defense, to save the Chinese nation from the crisis of extinction, and to seek liberation from the realm of semi-colonialism. In the occupied areas, on the front lines, after seven months of arduous struggle, although countless young people have sacrificed "for righteousness," countless young people immediately fill the vacant positions. They are writing an epic of the liberation of the Chinese nation with their blood. In Hong Kong, the "paradise of adventurers," although countless young men and women are intoxicated by jazz music and wine, on the other hand, countless young people with burning hearts are working seriously, boldly organizing "Return to the Country Service Corps" with the determination to sacrifice, and rushing to the embrace of the motherland!</p>
<p>The "Student Relief Association," which arose in the wake of the "July 7th" incident, is a product forged by Hong Kong students in the crucible of the great era. The Hong Kong student youth group has grown up in arduous struggle. In the past few months, under the surge of boiling blood, it has already organized three service corps to return to the country to work. Now, the fourth group has been established, a new contingent of thirty enthusiastic young people, with solemn and tense hearts, will rush to the motherland's front lines in the next few days. Undoubtedly, they will contribute to the liberation of the Chinese nation, fulfill their responsibility to the motherland, and become a powerful link in the Chinese nation's war of resistance.</p>
<p>When the reporter stepped into the Student Relief Association, a group of young people was working seriously and tensely. They were planning for their departure. The young leader shook hands warmly with the reporter and told me about the process of their organization and their work policy:</p>
<p>"We are ashamed to form this service corps with our weak strength. Of course, we dare not expect good results, but we believe that our work policy is not wrong." The young leader said politely, "Yes, in this sacred war of resistance, the motherland needs everyone to contribute their strength. Therefore, our thirty comrades, with the greatest determination to sacrifice, are rushing to the motherland. We will follow a certain division headquarters guarding the front lines of Sihui and Mafang, and provide military service. Although our skills are only to rescue wounded soldiers, comfort soldiers, and engage in political propaganda, we will organize the masses to participate in the war of resistance against Japan, seeking to achieve a true national war of self-defense. At the same time, we are also preparing to open refugee schools and promote rural culture. We are boldly taking on this responsibility..."</p>
<p>"Are your comrades all students?" I interjected with this sentence.</p>
<p>"Of course, most of us are students, but there are also many cultural workers. Therefore, in our purpose, we have implemented 'working and studying at the same time.' In the motherland's time of crisis today, we are no longer allowed to sit idly in classrooms like prisoners. We will serve the country on the one hand, and implement the method of 'self-education' on the other hand, to continuously increase our knowledge. We have truly run into the 'social university' that Gorky mentioned." The young leader paused slightly and continued, "Also, the soldiers on the front lines are lacking medicine. This will affect the direction of the war of resistance. Winter is coming, and cotton clothes are also urgently needed by the soldiers. We are all students, and we certainly cannot talk about material strength, so we hope for the assistance of overseas Chinese, to bring comfort items to the front lines. At the same time, we also hope that overseas Chinese will donate an ambulance, which is also urgently needed." Their departure date is probably set for around the 20th of this month!</p>
<p>With a warm handshake, I silently wished them well and bid farewell to this group of young fighters. On the way home, I realized with excitement that the youth of Hong Kong are not completely anesthetized. Their arduous struggle under material deprivation really moved me - this is truly moving. I will appeal to the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, in order to win the victory of the nation, let us all do our best!</p>

<h3>Progress from Bloody Lessons: The Active West River Guerrilla Force: A Record of Meeting with Zhu Man, Detachment Commander of the Guerrilla Force</h3>
<p>—Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, the West River guerrilla force emerged with a difficult and active posture.</p>
<p>The reasons for the rapid progress of the guerrilla force: first, the authorities accepted the bloody lessons and actively planned; second, the example of the occupied areas made the people realize that they should arm themselves to protect their homeland, and that only their own force is the most reliable force.</p>
<p>What is the recent situation of the West River guerrilla force? Yesterday, the reporter met with Zhu Man, the detachment commander of the ×× Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Guerrilla Detachment of the Tax Police Regiment, and learned a little. It is urgent to report to the overseas Chinese who care about the motherland.</p>
<p>According to Commander Zhu, "Before Guangzhou fell, there were only self-defense corps in the West River area. After the fall of Guangzhou, the anti-Japanese work in the area became tense, and at the same time, more people planned there. After October 27, when the Japanese advanced to Mianjiang, the local people truly felt the hideous faces of the Japanese and their brutal acts, and everyone strengthened their determination to protect their homeland and refreshed their spirit of taking righteousness and dying for it. The progress of anti-Japanese work was unprecedentedly smooth. The guerrilla force was established, and the enthusiasm of the participants deeply moved anyone who saw it. Later, after the battles of Makou, Mafang, and Qingqi, everyone saw the weaknesses and incompetence of the Japanese. The Japanese advance seemed very fierce, but after the heroic resistance of the guerrilla force, the Japanese forces showed their vulnerability everywhere. Finally, they had to gather in one or two strongholds and use strong firepower to cover themselves. Moreover, the morale of the Japanese was extremely low, which made our guerrilla force even more confident. At the same time, there was a sense of certainty of victory everywhere, so the number of people joining the guerrilla force became even more enthusiastic. As of last month, the total number of guerrilla forces between Sanshui and Sihui was no less than ten detachments.</p>
<p>"The planning of the guerrilla force adopts a mass movement approach. Resolute people do their individual work on weekdays, such as farming, working, and doing business... When the Japanese attack, they come out to resist Japan and defend their homeland. This must be said to be a kind of progress.</p>
<p>"In addition, war zone work teams have been organized, and there are no restrictions on men, women, old, and young. They all have their own tasks and their own command. This kind of organization has developed rapidly and has shown good results. In areas close to the Japanese, the work of clearing the fields and strengthening the walls also depends on them to carry out.</p>
<p>"Recently, the contact between the various teams has become closer, and the steps have become more consistent, which is the most gratifying thing for the planners.</p>
<p>"Although the Japanese have reached Mianjiang and Lianjiang, they have made no further progress. They are trying their best to increase their actions, but they are at a loss. In the future, even if the Japanese increase their strength, no matter where they reach in the West River, they will be fatally hit."</p>
<p>After listening to Commander Zhu's report, there are a few points worth noting.</p>
<p>First, the style of common development - Commander Zhu originally reported many details about the tax police regiment guerrilla force he directly led, which was also quite comforting to the compatriots; however, Commander Zhu repeatedly instructed that it was inconvenient to publish it, for fear that other guerrilla units would flaunt themselves, which would hinder the united front. Therefore, only the general dynamics of the West River guerrilla force were allowed to be published, and he hoped to have a more detailed overall report in the future. This style of overcoming the love of the limelight and common development is indeed a belief that those engaged in salvation work should have. Many young people have made progress in the practice of the war of resistance, and Commander Zhu is one of them.</p>
<p>Second, the spirit of abandoning politics and joining the military - since the sacred national war of resistance began, there have been many who abandoned their pens and joined the army, and there have also been quite a few who abandoned politics and joined the military. Commander Zhu was originally an employee of the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Because of the outbreak of the war, he was filled with righteous indignation and came out to lead the guerrilla force, shedding the uniform of public affairs and wearing a blue cloth gown like the common people. His heart was very enthusiastic, but his attitude was very calm. He reported the military situation fluently, like a military general who had experienced the battlefield. There are quite a few typical young people like this who have grown up in the war of resistance, which is perhaps a symbol of the improvement of the national fortune.</p>
<p>Third, the serious problem of cadre shortages - Regarding mobilizing the masses and launching guerrilla warfare, the most difficult thing at present is the lack of cadres. According to Commander Zhu, it is very necessary to have a group of people to approach the masses, organize the masses, and educate the masses. Such talents are very scarce at present. In the self-defense corps and the study teams, there is also a great need for politically trained talents, and such cadres are also very scarce. Therefore, he and a certain gentleman discussed that it is very necessary to train a group of new cadres who meet the needs of the objective situation and return to the mainland to start work. This is indeed a problem worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The West River guerrilla force bears the important task of counterattacking Guangzhou and protecting the Southwest. We sincerely pray that it will grow up healthily and become active. We deeply hope that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong will give it their care and assistance.</p>

<h3>Gushan in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>— Shao Yanqing</p>
<p>Almost everyone who has been to Minhou knows about Gushan in Fuzhou. The mountain is located nine kilometers east of the provincial capital, guarding the throat of the Min River as it enters the sea. It has peaks like Jueding, Baiyun, Shizi, and Bomeng, as well as Zhuoxi Peak. Among them, Jueding Peak is the highest, reaching 1,000 meters above sea level. Ascending the peak and looking into the distance, the topography of the Min River and sea areas is clearly visible.</p>
<p>Because there is a huge rock on the peak that resembles a stone drum, it is said that during storms, it makes a sound like a drum, hence the name Gushan (Drum Mountain). At the mountainside is the Yongquan Zen Temple, which is popularly said to have been built during the Five Dynasties period. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty once bestowed a plaque that read "Yongquan Temple at Baiyun Peak, Gushan". It was changed to a temple during the Ming Dynasty, and later burned down. Construction was not resumed until the Qing Dynasty. Legend has it that the person who initially built the temple was Master Zu, who built it after fighting a giant dragon entrenched on Gushan. However, this is just a myth about the opening of the mountain and the construction of the temple, and cannot be taken as reliable historical fact.</p>
<p>The scenery of Gushan is extremely beautiful. The mountains are covered with lush forests, and the misty peaks are secluded and beautiful. There are so many famous scenic spots that it is difficult to list them all. Among the more well-known ones are Heshui Rock, the Heavenly Ladder, Longji Road, Yinyue Pool, the Eighteen Caves, and the Eighteen Views. However, what makes Gushan most worth lingering over is the lush pine and cypress trees everywhere. When the wind blows, the sound of the waves is like a raging tide surging and ten thousand horses galloping, majestic and grand. In the spring, clear spring water flows through the mountain valleys, and the constant sound of trickling water is sent into the ears of tourists, making them forget the fatigue of climbing up and down the mountain slopes.</p>
<p>All of this has made Gushan a center for well-known travelers and devout worshippers. Every year, there are about 100,000 pilgrims and students who come to worship and travel. It is said that Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government is also a frequent visitor to Gushan.</p>
<p>The impression I have of Gushan dates back to when I was studying in Fujian as a child. I remember that when I thought of this towering mountain, my young heart felt a little stirred, but due to inconvenient transportation, I never went to visit it. After leaving Fujian, I went to other provinces and then became burdened by life, so there were even fewer opportunities to visit this famous mountain. In order to comfort my long-unfulfilled desire, this autumn, I managed to take a short vacation and quietly left bustling Shanghai with my wife on a boat. On October 6th, the boat arrived at Magang in Fuzhou, and we finally set foot on our long-separated homeland, feeling a surge of unspeakable joy in our hearts.</p>
<p>The morning after arriving in Fujian, we went to Gushan with several relatives from Minzhong. The construction of Fuzhou in recent years has indeed progressed a lot. In the past, to go to Gushan, only waterway transportation was available, and even when the wind and waves were calm, it still took half a day of rowing. Now it is different. You can take a long-distance bus on the Fuma (Fuzhou to Mawei) highway from the South Gate of the provincial capital, and it only takes half an hour to reach the foot of Gushan, which is really convenient.</p>
<p>Because I had been away for many years, everything seemed unfamiliar. Sitting in the bumpy car, I found it quite interesting to look at the street scenes of Fuzhou. After the car left the city, my mind felt refreshed. Looking out the car window, a vast expanse of yellow rice fields, set against the clear blue sky, revealed brightness and serenity under the bright sun.</p>
<p>After the car arrived at Gushan, we jumped out and walked a few dozen steps to the Baiyun Pavilion next to the foot of the mountain, where we hired a sedan chair to pile the clothes, mirror boxes, and suitcases we had brought. Only then did we feel relaxed, and we strode up the neat and long stone steps. The morning breeze blowing on our faces felt slightly cool. The rising sun was shaded by the dense trees, making the scene even more secluded. However, when we occasionally looked up, the hazy sunlight covered the branches on the right side of the road, seeming to hold our boundless warmth and comfort.</p>
<p>From the mountain gate, following the main road to Yongquan Temple, there are more than 1,500 stone steps. Along the way, there are five pavilions. After passing through the third pavilion, we turned onto a small path. Along the road, we saw clusters of young trees arranged unevenly, as well as many mountain rocks and mottled giant rocks scattered on both sides, some piled together, showing a rugged and prominent air. As I walked and looked around, I was overwhelmed with the sights. At noon, we had lunch in a cave of a certain high-ranking monk. After the meal, we chatted with the monk about cultivating oneself.</p>
<p>In the setting sun, with the evening breeze blowing, we regained our spirits and headed towards Yongquan Temple in the dusk. After walking along many winding stone steps, we reached a secluded path covered with fallen leaves. At this time, the setting sun was blocked by the towering mountain wall on the left, and all that was visible was the dense ancient pine trees, with the sound of waves constantly entering our ears with the evening breeze, making us feel the beauty of nature. After passing this secluded path, we reached the main road leading directly to Yongquan Temple. Without stopping, our footsteps quickly brought us to the mountain gate of Yongquan Temple.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky was already twilight, but our interest in sightseeing was still strong. We even strolled around Heshui Rock near the left side of the temple before returning to the Zen temple. In the hazy light, we followed the crowd through the side door of the temple, walked past the dark Heavenly King Hall corridor, and then entered a courtyard of about ten zhang square. In the center of the courtyard was a small pond, with two lightning rods, each more than ten zhang high, erected at both ends of the pond. Below were the words "Cast and donated by the colleagues of the Fuzhou Shipyard." The depth and firmness of the Min people's belief can be seen here. Passing through this courtyard, we reached the Daxiong Hall in the second courtyard. Next to the left side of this hall, there was a small door with the words "Guest Hall" written on it. Following this door was a corridor, with the guest hall and side rooms on the left, and a small rectangular courtyard on the right. Dozens of pots of chrysanthemums were arranged in the courtyard, trimmed very neatly. Many students were coming and going in the corridor, some wearing Zhongshan suits, others wearing sports clothes, hurrying back and forth, with singing, talking, and harmonica sounds mixed together, reminding me of dormitory life during my student days.</p>
<h3>Anli Wheel Repairs and Leaves Dock Soon to Sail Hong Kong-Macao Route Traffic Enters Dock for Repairs, Jiang Dai Hang Substitutes</h3>
<p>The Dali and Anli wheels of the Si Yi (Four Counties) Steamship Company of this port, which used to run the Hong Kong-Jiangmen route, have been affected since ×× invaded Guangzhou, and all the river channels were blocked. The Dali wheel was stranded in Guangzhou and unable to return to Hong Kong. Only the Anli wheel remained in operation. Recently, it was docked for repairs. Now the wheel has been repaired and left the dock, and is moored at the Ping An Wharf. According to someone on board, the wheel will start running the Hong Kong-Macao route on the 15th of this month. As for the departure time, it is planned to depart for Macao at 8:00 AM every day and return to Hong Kong at 2:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>Also, the Traffic vessel of the Taisheng Company returned to Hong Kong from Macao yesterday morning and immediately entered the dock for repairs, which are expected to take about ten days. During the period when this wheel is being repaired, the Haojiang wheel will take its place.</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Transportation</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The economic hub of Fujian Province has now shifted from the coast to the interior. In order to develop inter-provincial trade, the authorities have planned to organize joint transportation between Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. Joint transportation between Fujian and Zhejiang has already been implemented, with the Jiangpu section as the connection point, that is, from Jiangshan County in Zhejiang Province to Pucheng County in Fujian Province. The business is quite developed. Now, joint transportation between Fujian and Jiangxi will also be opened in the middle of this month, starting from Yanping in Fujian Province and ending in Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, with a direct bus service once a day. There is no need to change cars or tickets along the way, and it takes two days to arrive. If you take a steamboat from Fuzhou to Yanping, and then take a car from Yanping to Nanchang, it will take three days to arrive. The transportation is extremely convenient. Therefore, the Directorate General of Posts has recently been forwarding mail from foreign countries to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces through Fuzhou, in order to expedite delivery. Currently, passenger transport is being handled first, and freight transport will be organized later. The road freight rates in this province are also cheaper than in other provinces. For example, the freight price for every 50 kilograms per kilometer is an average of 6 points in other provinces, while in Fujian Province it is only 4 points, or 3.5 points, or even 3 points. The freight for local products is as low as 2.5 points or 2 points, and the freight for grain is even lower, only 1.5 points per 50 kilograms per kilometer. In addition, the number of buses on the Fuzhou-Xinghua-Quanzhou line and the Yanping-Shaxian-Yongan line has been increased. The telephone line on the Yongchun-Dehua-Datian line has been completed. The roadbed and surface on the Yongan-Liancheng-Changting line have also been improved. The Yongan East Station and the car factory have both started construction. The station houses in Sanyuan and Xinkou, which belong to Sha, and Guangzhou and Hongtian, which belong to Liancheng, will be completed soon. In the past few months, the highway operating income of the whole province has increased to more than 180,000 yuan per month after rectification. Although the costs have increased (the price of gasoline has increased from one yuan and one quarter per gallon to one yuan and eight jiao and one point, and the price of tires has increased from 80 yuan per piece to 180 yuan), the Quanzhou-Xiamen highway, which has the most prosperous business, was broken down after the fall of Xiamen. The balance of income and expenditure still has a slight surplus, and the materials and oils have been fully stored, which is sufficient for use. In addition, Fuzhou's import and export trade has been booming recently. The main export goods are timber, fruits, paper, and sugar. The import goods are not only for the province's own use, but also transshipped to Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. Foreign ships between Shanghai and Fuzhou have been very frequent recently. Most of the merchants engaged in import and export trade have made profits. It is expected that the business and finance markets will be stable during the upcoming lunar New Year.</p>

<h3>Returning from Changsha</h3>
<p>— Lü Tongren</p>
<p>At this critical moment when the nation is in danger and the life of the race is being threatened, all young people with a bit of heart are stepping forward to fulfill their duties as citizens. Because of this, my little heart was finally stirred by the passion of national salvation. I ran back to Hong Kong from Saigon, Annam, alone. Because I was alone, I felt too lonely, so I found an old classmate, Mr. Li, in Hong Kong who shared my aspirations. Our goal was to go to northern Shaanxi to learn some knowledge about national salvation and to train ourselves to endure hardship. I ran away from home without saying goodbye. Mr. Li was in the same situation as me, but he was even more enthusiastic because he abandoned his studies to go. At first, we were hesitant because we couldn't solve the problem of travel expenses. After more than a month of fundraising, we finally scraped together a small sum of money, and we prepared to set off.</p>
<p>It was a morning on October 13, 1938. The weather was warm and the sky was lovely. We hurried, each carrying a leather bag of no particular size, to the pier where the boats to and from Guangdong and Hong Kong arrived, and boarded the Jinshan Wheel. At that time, the passengers were extremely crowded. Because we were a little late, we didn't even have a bed to sit or lie on. We had to lean against the side of the boat and stand. In an instant, the boat carried us away from the island of Hong Kong and sailed away. On this Jinshan boat, there were forty or fifty young men and women rescue workers returning from Burma. They were going to Hankou after arriving in Guangzhou, and then to the front line to serve. Their team included people from Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, and indigenous people from Burma. They all spoke in Mandarin or English. These forty or fifty rescue workers were all full of energy and courage. We talked to one of the team members, who said that they had all volunteered to return, all had considerable rescue knowledge, and were equipped with medicines and several private cars. After hearing what the team member said, we knew that they were very organized and deeply loved the country. It was just a few hours of sea voyage, and soon, at 1:00 PM that day, we arrived in Guangzhou. The rescue worker who had spoken to us knew that we were unfamiliar with the place and introduced us to a hotel in Guangzhou when we landed. Who knew that when we went there to look for it, the lodging house had already been destroyed by the ruthless bombing. We had no choice but to go to the South China Hotel in Shamian.</p>
<p>This was something we had not expected. The war was becoming so tense. That night when we arrived in Guangzhou, the transportation to and from Guangdong and Hong Kong was cut off, and Humen was blockaded. The situation was extremely chaotic. Guangzhou was a city I had never been to before. The sounds of air raid alarms and artillery were something I had never heard before. Although we were in this chaos, we were not alarmed at all. We were always determined to move forward and not retreat. The next day, there were no trains going to Hankou, so we stayed for three days in a row. During these three days, the planes came to bomb almost every day. It can be said that we were in air raid alarms all day long. At night, the whole city was pitch black, without a single light. At that time, the citizens were already moving away one after another, and there was almost no order on the streets. We were not afraid at all. We went out to find friends, buy necessities, and get a letter of introduction from the Eighth Route Army's office in Guangdong. Everything was very exciting. On the first day I arrived in Guangzhou, I could still see those energetic young men and women student soldiers. By the second or third day, the situation was different. These trained students had already left. Not a single one was seen. It was said that it was an order from the authorities. At this critical time when combat cadres were urgently needed, why did the authorities order them to leave first? To our shallow minds, it seemed wrong, but what the authorities' plans were, we could not know.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 16th, we were fortunate enough to catch a slow train to Hankou. Here, I would also like to say something about the danger and ridiculousness of our trip to catch the train. That night, two trains were running, one special express and one slow train. Because there were so many soldiers and passengers during this tense period, both the express and slow trains had almost no empty seats. Because we wanted to leave Guangzhou a little earlier, we wanted to take the special express train first, but there were no seats. What should we do? Some people went up to sit on the roof of the car. We followed them and climbed up. Later, the more we thought about it, the more inappropriate it seemed. We hurriedly climbed down in a panic. If you were on such a high roof, you would be frostbitten by the cold air, and it would be even more dangerous if the planes came to attack. The slow train was also full of people. In the crowd of people in a state of panic, our hearts were really anxious, like ants on a hot pot, not knowing what to do. Because if we missed the train that night, we didn't know when we would be able to go. Later, we found a person in the post office and said a lot of sincere words to him, and he allowed us to get on the train, giving us a small gap, so that we could barely sit down.</p>
<p>As soon as we boarded this Guangdong-Hankou train, we heard the people in the car speaking Mandarin. This is worth understanding. The train from Guangzhou to Hankou costs twelve yuan in national currency. Because we didn't have time to buy tickets at the ticket office, we bought tickets after boarding the train. Just as the sky was about to dawn, the air raid alarm sounded. At that time, the weather was already cold. In the dark wilderness, we quickly jumped out of the car and fled into the forest, but our luggage was left on the car. The air raid alarm was not lifted until dawn. We avoided countless air raids along the way. Sometimes, we didn't even drive for a whole day. Because we stopped to hide in the wilderness, we didn't even have a meal all day. The most difficult thing was for those women and children with delicate hands and feet, who had to follow us to climb mountains, cross ridges, and drill through trees. The car stopped for a few minutes at each stop, with guards waiting and hawkers selling food to the passengers. We passed through Qujiang, Lechang, Hengyang, and many smaller towns, which I can't remember. We also crossed more than a dozen mountain tunnels. Once the car went in, it was like driving at night, and we couldn't see any sunlight. Many of the tracks and bridges were destroyed by bombing, but workers were repairing them after the bombing, and there was no obstruction. Some passengers got off the train halfway, and some went straight to Changsha and Hankou, so it was not as crowded as when we first set out, and people felt much more comfortable. In this way, after three days and nights, we arrived in Changsha on the evening of the 19th.</p>

<h3>Current Situation of the Leather Industry in Hong Kong: Stable Market for Finished Leather, Sharp Decline in Raw Hide Exports</h3>
<p>Leather is the raw material for manufacturing leather shoes. Although the annual production of raw cattle hides in our country is considerable, the manufacturing of finished leather has not yet mastered the proper techniques. Therefore, raw hides are exported on one hand, while finished leather is imported on the other. It is found that 90% of the finished leather in Hong Kong comes from Sydney, Australia, with Canada accounting for only one-tenth of the imports. Finished leather from Canada and Sydney is used for making Western shoe soles. It is said that citizens mostly favor Western shoes, so the annual trade volume is 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan, with 70% to 80% being consumed in this city and only 20% to 30% being sold to various parts of the country. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the domestic market has been further affected. Leather prices mostly fluctuate according to changes in exchange rates. Currently, the market price of Sydney leather is 50 to 60 yuan per picul (depending on the grade), high-grade leather is 100 to 120 yuan per piece, and extra-thick leather is 170 to 180 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Pigskin is used for making shoe uppers, with an annual import value of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Germany accounts for 80% of the production, and the remaining 20% comes from the United States. The price is 80 cents to 1 yuan per foot.</p>
<p>Red leather is used for making soles for Chinese-style shoes. The largest source is Pignon, accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. Singapore is next, accounting for one-third. Although there are sources from Siam, Haiphong, Annam, and other places, they are extremely rare. It is found that the annual trade value of red leather is over 2 million yuan, with 50% being sold to the mainland of Guangdong, and most of the rest being consumed by Hong Kong merchants, except for a small amount sold to Guangzhou Bay. Although there was some red leather manufacturing in the mainland last spring, it was only of a home-based handicraft nature, with very little production. The current market price of red leather can be generally divided into: 65 yuan per picul for high-grade, 50 yuan per picul for medium-grade, and 42 yuan per picul for low-grade (before July 7th, each picul was about 10 yuan lower). Currently, due to the inconvenience of transportation between Hong Kong and the mainland, the market situation is extremely bleak.</p>
<p>Raw hides are produced domestically, divided into yellow cattle hides and water buffalo hides. All of those exported from Hong Kong are produced in Guangdong and Guangxi, with an annual amount of 4 to 5 million yuan. The largest sales destinations are Japan and Germany, each accounting for almost 50% of the total. The markets in Britain, Italy, France, and the United States account for only a small portion. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has controlled imports, so the export of domestic raw hides has decreased by 50%. As a result, raw hide prices have also plummeted.</p>
<p>The current market price of raw hides is 60 to 70 yuan per picul for yellow cattle hides and 40 to 50 yuan per picul for water buffalo hides.</p>
<p>There are currently five or six leather factories (red and leather hides) in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They have adopted European and American methods and have achieved good results, with an annual output of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The raw materials mostly rely on raw hides from Guangdong and Guangxi because there is insufficient cattle slaughtering in Hong Kong to supply them.</p>

<h3>Who Does Not Desire Goodness as Much as I Do? Li Huitang Considers Going to Shanghai, But Hesitates Due to the Yunxia Incident</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Li Guiyong, a member of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, recently sent a letter to Zhou Shoushen, asking him to urge Li Huitang, who has been away from Shanghai for many years, to go north to participate in a charity football match to raise funds to benefit the disaster-stricken people.</p>
<p>The committee is jointly organized by Chinese and Western individuals in Shanghai. Shen Liang, the Director-General of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, is also a member. Since its establishment, it has greatly benefited refugees. Currently, there are still over 100,000 refugees in Shanghai, and providing for them is a huge task that is not easy to manage. Therefore, it is planned to organize a charity football match and invite Li Huitang to go north to participate.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, Zhou Shoushen immediately conveyed this intention to Li. However, Li was concerned about the suspension of the Hong Kong small football team's trip to Zhou last summer, and he did not dare to agree hastily. If he receives understanding from all parties and it is deemed feasible, he will not hesitate to travel north to appeal for the disaster-stricken people. The letters are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter 1</p>
<p>Respectful greetings to Mr. Shoushen,</p>
<p>Your younger brother, in Chongqing Customs and traveling in Beiping, received your letter, which brought great joy. Since our last meeting, many seasons have passed, and my thoughts of you have never ceased. I hope you are well. The war has been going on for eighteen months, and the people in the disaster areas have been displaced. It is found that there are still over 100,000 refugees in Shanghai, and providing for them is a huge task that is not easy to manage. My colleagues and I plan to launch a charity football match to raise funds to provide assistance. We thought of Mr. Li Huitang, who is currently residing in Hong Kong. Mr. Li has long enjoyed a great reputation in the sports world and has been away from Shanghai for several years. The people of Shanghai miss him deeply. If he is willing to come to Shanghai to participate in the competition, the audience will surely rush to attend, and a large sum of money can be raised easily. Indeed, with Mr. Li's efforts alone, the lives of tens of thousands of people can be sustained, and his merits will be immeasurable. I have long admired your high moral character and great prestige. I specially write this letter to implore you to persuade him to participate in this charitable cause. Your favor will be deeply appreciated. I eagerly await your reply and wish you well.</p>
<p>Li Guiyong, respectfully, December 29th, 27th year,</p>
<p>Letter 2</p>
<p>Respectful greetings to Mr. Detang,</p>
<p>I received a letter from Mr. Li Guiyong of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, stating that there are currently over 100,000 refugees in Shanghai and that providing for them is a huge task. It is planned to launch a charity football match to raise funds. I am asked to persuade you to come to Shanghai to participate in the competition to increase the audience and contribute to the charitable cause. I have long admired your enthusiasm for charity and your willingness to do what is right. Therefore, I am writing this letter to you and enclosing the original letter for your reference. Please let me know your decision so that I can forward it to them. I wish you well.</p>
<p>Zhou Shoushen, respectfully, January 9th, 28th year</p>
<p>Letter 3</p>
<p>Respectful greetings to Elder Shoushen,</p>
<p>I have read your letter and the letter from the Shanghai International Relief Committee. I am deeply moved by the committee's concern for the disaster-stricken people and their intention to invite me to go north to participate in the charity football match. Everyone desires goodness as much as I do. During this sacred war of resistance, we in the sports world feel ashamed that we have not made a greater contribution to the country and society. If my participation can increase revenue and benefit the disaster-stricken people, I would be happy to do so. However, I recall that last year, a small football team from Hong Kong also planned to send a team to Shanghai to hold a Leader's Cup charity match to raise funds to aid the disaster-stricken compatriots. The purpose was noble and upright, but the trip did not materialize. This time, my personal trip north has the same meaning. I wonder if there will be any objections. In short, if the matter is for a good cause and the public agrees, then I will go through fire and water without hesitation, let alone the hardship of traveling. I am expressing my sincere thoughts and hope for your understanding. I wish you well.</p>
<p>Li Huitang, January 10th, 28th year</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Participation in Charity Volleyball Tournament</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Reporters' Sports Special Committee has launched a charity volleyball tournament to appeal for the disaster-stricken people. The committee has already issued a notice and started registration. Various teams have shown great support for this charitable cause. The committee believes that it is the duty of all teams to participate in this competition. Therefore, it is planned to award a silver cup to the champion team upon the completion of the competition. However, according to reports, the teams have made suggestions, stating that this charity tournament is to appeal for the disaster-stricken people, and the outcome of the competition is not the main concern. Therefore, the award of the silver cup can be waived, so that the funds can be fully allocated to the disaster-stricken people. To respect the wishes of all teams, it is suggested that each team be presented with a certificate or a flag at the end of the competition as a memento, which is considered more appropriate.</p>

<h3>Nurses Association Launches Charity Volleyball Tournament</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Nurses Association believes that the soldiers fighting on the front lines are sacrificing themselves for the nation and are unfortunately injured, and they often lack medical supplies. In light of this, the association believes that the rear should do its best to support the front lines. Therefore, it has launched a charity volleyball tournament to raise funds to purchase medical supplies and transport them to the front lines. The association has already issued a circular to invite teams from Zhongda University and Lingnan University. After discussion, the two teams expressed their sympathy and agreed to send teams to participate in the competition, which is scheduled to be held at the Paul's College field at 3:30 PM next Saturday.</p>

After deducting expenses such as scaffolding, printing, tea, and miscellaneous items totaling 216.04 yuan, the net proceeds of 1,969.73 yuan were sent to the China Youth Relief Corps for disaster relief and fundraising expenses.</p>
<h3>Philippine Team to Come to Hong Kong for Match on Lunar New Year's Day; Hong Kong Team Will Fulfill Agreement to Visit Philippines After End of Football Season</h3>
<p>The news of the Philippine team coming to Hong Kong to compete in football on Lunar New Year's Day has been circulating for some time. Although there has been no formal reply from the Philippine side, according to recent correspondence between the (Hong Kong-Philippine) organizers, the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong is likely to happen.</p>
<p>According to the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Regulations, there is a limit to the number of military players who can be selected. However, this Hong Kong-Philippine Interport match will not have this restriction. There are many good players in the army, navy, and air force stationed in Hong Kong, so the lineup will definitely be strong.</p>
<p>In the past, the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation has often spent large sums of money to invite foreign football teams to perform in the Philippines to learn from each other. The visit of the British Corinthian football team last May was particularly noteworthy. At that time, the Philippine team played very well against the same team, and their football skills improved compared to before. Two years ago, Hong Kong's Chinese-Austrian and strong Eastern teams visited the Philippines one after another, arousing a lot of football interest among the local people. Therefore, it is expected that the Philippine team will be able to come to Hong Kong in return.</p>
<p>When the Hong Kong Football Association invited the Philippine team to come to Hong Kong to compete, the Philippine side put forward the condition that if the team is invited to come to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong team must visit the Philippines after the end of the football season in April of this year. If this can be realized, then the Hong Kong team will inevitably have to go to the Philippines in the future. Therefore, it has been suggested that the Hong Kong Football Association should immediately notify all associations to recruit players who may be able to go to the Philippines, so as not to affect the expeditionary team due to the fact that the selected players cannot be released from Hong Kong temporarily.</p>
<h3>Three Women's Basketball Matches Tonight</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper] The women's basketball tournament is nearing its championship decision.</p>
<p>Among the three strong teams, Huaqiao has failed twice and is declared hopeless. Therefore, the contest for the championship and runner-up will be between Meifang and Peidao only.</p>
<p>According to the schedule, there are three matches tonight, to be held at the YMCA gymnasium. The first match is at 6:30 PM, Southwest vs. Peidao. Southwest's fighting spirit is not bad, but compared to Peidao, there is a clear difference in strength. Peidao is a strong contender for the championship and will undoubtedly defeat Southwest.</p>
<p>The second match is at 7:30 PM, Huaqiao vs. Hong Kong University. Although Huaqiao is known as a strong team, its players are not evenly matched. Therefore, it was defeated by Peidao and Meifang one after another. However, its score is still good, and it will likely rank third. Tonight's match against Hong Kong University is sure to be a victory.</p>
<p>The last match is at 8:30 PM, South China vs. Paul's College. The Paul's College girls are still new to the game, and their strength is also inferior to South China. Therefore, South China should win two points. The players of each team are as follows:</p>

<h3>Movies and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment...Wanderer of the Sea Corner</p>
<p>Algiers</p>
<p>The story takes place in a mysterious and strange place like those described in "Arabian Nights," called Algiers. Although it is now a French territory, one part of the city is quite modern, while the other part, inhabited by the natives, still completely retains the mysterious colors of ancient Orient. There, lawlessness prevails, and it is a gathering place for thieves and fugitives. The director has created a sinister and terrifying atmosphere in such a setting and has also woven a touching story. The insidious and brutal acts of the bandits fill every inch of film with mystery, horror, and strong stimulation.</p>
<p>The story tells of an international art thief who flees to this place. The betrayal of his accomplices and the pursuit of detectives are all outsmarted by him, but he succumbs to a charming French woman and loses his life.</p>
<p>Charles Boyer gives a very profound performance of the thief's character in this film. Hedy Lamarr, the female lead who starred in "Ecstasy," is also an excellent actress. Xue Liejia, in her first film, "The Adventures of Marco Polo," played the daughter of Kublai Khan and left us with a very good impression. In this film, she plays a native girl who passionately loves the thief, and her outstanding acting skills are worth our special appreciation.</p>
<p>Queen...Big-Mouth Woman Chases Sailor</p>
<p>Give Me A Sailor</p>
<p>Martha Raye and Bob Hope have had several successful collaborations in the past, and they give even more outstanding performances in this film, proving that they are a very suitable pair. The film is full of jokes and is an ideal work for audiences who watch movies for entertainment.</p>
<p>The story depicts the wild and debauched lives of some American sailors on leave. Among them, a pair of brothers-in-arms on the same ship create a lot of jokes because they chase the wrong love interest.</p>
<p>Martha Raye is the central figure of the film's humor. She plays a girl who is unloved but self-indulgent and maintains an excellent performance from beginning to end. Bob's strange facial expressions and his humorous and witty lines can be called unparalleled.</p>
<p>Also co-starring is Tigra Rabo, a beautiful and lively actress. She also has a clear and melodious singing voice. There are four new songs in the film, all recent works by famous musicians, and they are sung by the two of them, adding a lot of entertainment value to the film.</p>
<p>Peace...Arsenal Spy Gang</p>
<p>The Spy Ring</p>
<p>A spy film with little to recommend. The director has failed to fully develop the spies' activities and adventurous conspiracies. Moreover, the forced insertion of polo matches and some humorous scenes has cobbled together this incongruous film.</p>
<p>The story tells how a group of international spies are active in the United States, trying to steal the blueprints of a newly developed air defense weapon, but their cunning plot is finally thwarted due to the inventor's bravery and cleverness. The acting skills of all the actors are also very ordinary.</p>
<p>Orient...Arabian Storm</p>
<p>I Cover The War</p>
<p>An early war film depicting the Mesopotamian rebellion, with a romance inserted at the same time. If viewed with today's eyes, the few war scenes in it cannot be said to be successful. The protagonist is John Ford.</p>
<p>Dahua...Beauty Fades Easily</p>
<p>You're Only Young Once</p>
<p>A social film that is very enlightening for young people, giving young men and women powerful insights into love.</p>
<p>The story tells of a happy family whose head is a fair and wise judge. He has one son and one daughter. When his family travels in California, his children each enter a wrong path of complicated love affairs. He painstakingly rescues his children.</p>
<p>Although it is a very ordinary story, the director's skills are not weak, making it develop in a very fresh and lively way. In terms of actors, because of the proper arrangement, there are good performances, especially Louis Stone, who plays the judge, and his performance of understanding the psychology of young people's love is subtle.</p>
<p>Scenic Star...Treasure Island</p>
<p>Treasure Island</p>
<p>A film adapted from the famous book "Treasure Island." The main actors are Wallace Beery, Mack Brown, and Lionel Barrymore, and their performances are perfect.</p>
<p>Central...Great War Flying Guest</p>
<p>Galloping Ghost</p>
<p>A film produced by a small American company, Republic, with no artistic value. The entire film is designed to please the audience with slapstick fights and vulgar adventure scenes, just as the advertisement says, "the great contribution after 'Underwater Electric Country.'"</p>
<p>New World...Good Girl Marries Eighteen Times</p>
<p>Sequel</p>
<p>Cantonese film starring Yue'er</p>
<p>North River...Cantonese Opera</p>
<p>Taiping Men and Women Troupe</p>

<h3>Road</h3>
<p>— Yu Ping</p>
<p>For the sake of the road, many people are troubled, especially young people in the great era. Although there are many revolutionary mentors who are instructing us, as Mr. Qi said, "Although there are many young people fighting and working on the front lines and in the rear, most young people still feel depressed and bewildered by ideological, political, and organizational problems, or feel that they have power but cannot use it, and that they have knowledge but cannot contribute."</p>
<p>It seems that there are many roads in front of us, and it seems that there are no roads at all. The problem is actually whether we have the determination and courage to run the road, and ability is secondary. In a word, it is still our petty-bourgeois consciousness that is at work. Originally, there is a broad road to travel, but we are confused by the bewilderment of wavering consciousness, and we become drowsy, from suspicion to not being able to see the road. But although we pessimistically and despairingly think that there is no road, the fact is that as long as we live for one day, we are still on the road, but this is not the road we idealize.</p>
<p>The world is neither as good as we imagine, nor as bad as we imagine. As long as you are willing to work hard, dare to face reality, and fight against life, there is a road. Mr. Lu Xun seems to have said this: "There was originally no road, but people stepped it out later." (meaning similar). We cannot return to our motherland, cannot go to the front line to kill ×, cannot go to the rear to mobilize the masses, cannot go to the occupied areas to fight guerrilla warfare, is there no road—? We must make a surprise attack and break a path out of nowhere. This is not impossible, life is originally a kind of struggle.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that we must observe things from the perspective of dynamic development, and at the same time, we must flexibly use correct theories. The problem of dealing with the road must also be handled in this way. Even if people can leave the environment, they should not succumb to the environment; the secret of dealing with the world lies in being able to adapt to the environment, use the environment, and then control the environment. To those friends who think they cannot find a road, this is also our secret to finding a road!</p>
<p>Life is a struggle! Take care!</p>
<h3>Starting with Goya</h3>
<p>— Kai Qin</p>
<p>Because the Japanese "first-rate writer" Sato Haruo came to Shanghai to appreciate the post-war Zhabei, saying it was like seeing Goya's book, I was reminded of some current issues in painting.</p>
<p>In reality, if there were truly a painter like Goya today, it would be extremely necessary. Not to mention his already famous "The Disasters of War" and similar works, just his attitude towards painting would have a tremendous effect if he were here today. But that effect, needless to say, is not the peculiar taste pursued by Sato Haruo.</p>
<p>We can frankly say that China has never had a painter like this. Chinese national paintings were often just simple historical paintings, and even the highest achievements could only barely be compared to the French Rococo painter Watteau. But this is only a rough comparison. However, in the late Qing Dynasty, a great painter emerged, and that was Wu Jiayou, known as Youru.</p>
<p>This painter's name has long been forgotten, and recently, when people talked about "Shanghai Anecdotes," it was only mentioned incidentally. This is appropriate. Wu Youru's achievements, generally speaking, are twofold: first, he created true genre paintings; second, he created large-scale four-panel illustrations. Both of these are unprecedented in the history of Chinese painting. He not only brought painting into close relationship with current affairs but also used painting as a weapon to resist foreign aggression. I don't have "Dianshizhai Pictorial" or "Feiyingge Pictorial" at hand, but I remember that in his works, in addition to the descriptions of the major current events of the time, the Sino-French War, there were also protests against the concession courts. Of course, he never directly opposed the Qing court, and sometimes even praised it, and his realistic techniques were sometimes naive, but those should be attributed to his situation and his era.</p>
<p>In recent studies of Chinese painting (such as Mr. Yu Jianhua's "History of Chinese Painting"), there is almost no mention of Wu Youru. The reason why everyone prefers to remember Qian Hui'an, a painter who lived in Shanghai at the same time as Wu Youru and was also famous for painting figures, is because Qian is elegant, and Wu is vulgar. Of course, according to the theory of Chinese painting, Qian is qualified. But what does Qian paint? Just some ladies and gentlemen who have absolutely nothing to do with his surroundings (which is fundamentally different from Wu's historical records). Elegance is certainly good, but I think the most thorough elegance is still Mi Fu's landscape paintings, where he uses the brush to arbitrarily dot around, without any "craftsman's touch" at all, but what is the use of that, no one can say.</p>
<p>I am not saying that current painters must learn from Wu Youru; I am just saying that a painter like Wu Youru is still needed today. Current painters need to pay attention to his attitude, his planning, and his subject matter. If there could be a painter now who could run a pictorial like Wu Youru, I think it would still be useful. Of course, for real news, there is now photography, but like Wu Youru, extracting the essence of current events, depicting the real characters of pursuit and satire, and even adding a popular explanation at the end, as Wu Youru did, would still be extremely meaningful. As for the technique needing to be more advanced and to be melted into new techniques, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>There are still art schools in Shanghai now. But I don't know what the courses are like at all. However, judging from the usual "art style," it is certainly impossible to go to the countryside for sketching now, but probably everyone is still in the room, lighting a fire, drawing a model of the body, and the people who are copied are probably still Raphael's Madonna and the like. As basic courses, it cannot be said that these should not be learned. But at present, I think that since there is time to use Western works of the past to hone art, it would be much more beneficial to copy Goya's works than to copy Raphael's, and it would not be wrong to learn from works like Daumier and Toulouse-Lautrec. These are just two painters that I thought of at random. Applying that kind of art to the present is certainly not enough, but if that kind of method were to be developed, it could at least expose the decay of a certain part of this painting, and at least it could vividly depict the original shape of the good and the bad. However, these two painters are also rumored in the West to be painters with a "craftsman's touch," and their names are often not mentioned in art history.</p>
<h3>On the Massacre in Jiading</h3>
<p>— Yang Baozheng</p>
<p>—A Reportage on the People's Resistance to the Qing Dynasty in the Late Ming Dynasty—</p>
<p>"A Record of the Massacre in Jiading," originally named "Dongtang Diary," also known as "Jiading 'Youji Lue'," is a book recording how the people of Jiading resisted the war in the late Ming Dynasty. The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, was personally present and what he recorded was of course very close to the truth. In the late Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui led the Qing troops south. Traitorous officials surrendered to him. After Yangzhou was captured, the people who were still holding out and resisting the war included Jiangyin, Kunshan, Jiading, Songjiang and Jinshanwei. The resistance in Yangzhou, Jiading and Jiangyin was the most fervent and tragic. And the massacres were also the most severe. There was a saying at the time, "It's bitterer than Jiading, it's more tragic than Jiangyin!" The painful situation at the time can be imagined!</p>
<p>"Dongtang Diary" is a real-time record of that time, and it is a first-class reportage literature of national consciousness. The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, whose courtesy name was Jiuchu, was a supplementary county student. He was assigned to the Ministry of Rites in the year of Jia Shen, but he gave up the position and lived in seclusion as a professor. He was of course a man of integrity. He also edited "Records of Loyal Subjects of Past Dynasties" and "Brief Records of Mourning for Loyal and Upright Officials," which were all full of national consciousness. The works describing the national resistance in Jiading that Mr. Zhu left behind are of course also full of national consciousness. As far as I know, there are now six published versions of this book:</p>
<p>(1) Jingtuo General Edition</p>
<p>(2) Unofficial History of the Late Ming Dynasty Edition</p>
<p>(3) Records Compilation Edition</p>
<p>(4) Shenbao Press Typeset Edition</p>
<p>(5) Series on Internal Strife and Foreign Disasters in China Edition</p>
<p>(6) Muqing Jiazi Huitang Zhu Chunsheng Manuscript Edition</p>
<p>The Zhu Chunsheng manuscript is originally named "Dongtang Diary," with a summary by Zhu Jiuchu in the front and a postscript by Zhu Chunsheng on the 23rd night of the first month of Jiazi in the back. It is now hidden at Zhou Chengzhong's place in Jiading, and it was once typeset and published. The original was exhibited at the Shanghai Literature Exhibition held in the Shanghai Museum. Comparing this book with the previous published versions, it is known that the previous published versions have all been tampered with by people in the Qing Dynasty, losing their original appearance—but this manuscript is Mr. Zhu Zisu's original manuscript.</p>
<p>This manuscript calls the people's "righteous soldiers" "our army" and the "Qing soldiers" "Northern soldiers." All the newly appointed dignitaries of the Qing court are also called "Northern" without the prefix "Qing." And many published versions call them "Great Qing" and "Qing soldiers," and call "Prince Yu" "Grand General of the Manchu Army," which is certainly not the work of Mr. Zhu Zisu, who had national consciousness. This manuscript criticizes the then magistrate of Jiading, saying that Magistrate Qian Mo "did not care about his official position, and people had no laws to follow." and the Japanese have deleted it—as evidenced by Jiading's "Shangzhai Jianwenlu," which also says:</p>
<p>"The new magistrate of Jiading is Qian Mo from Jiashan, Zhejiang, who is not well-known. His name is Mo, and he was a jinshi in the same class as the former Magistrate Cao. While in office, he became a son of a noodle shop owner. He was young and known for his talent, but when he became a government official, he specialized in exploitation, and the people were full of complaints!"</p>
<p>At that time, Magistrate Qian Mo was indeed a public gangster who exploited the people, but the published version deleted his crimes and hid his sins!</p>
<p>This manuscript calls Jiang Ruolai at that time, a truly loyal and virtuous man, saying "When the Northern soldiers entered the south, Ruolai fled back, killed his wife and children, and entered the sea to rely on Prince Yiyang." He killed his wife and then escaped to the sea. How upright he was! But the published version calls Ruolai "a rascal in the market who was promoted to an official by his strength, and fled his post when he heard that Weiyang was captured." Jiang Ruolai was actually a negligent rascal! This manuscript says that Ruolai "looked at the dozens of copper guns in the warehouse and ordered people to carry them away, and then entered the sea from Xujiakou." He took away the important weapons that Jiading had to avoid encountering the enemy. This kind of retreat was the most necessary, but the published version changed it again, saying that Ruolai "hurriedly went to the market, leaving only dozens of thousands of copper coins, carried them away, and looted greatly after passing through Xujia, leaving nothing behind, and the farmers' cries shook the sky." Jiang Ruolai was actually a bandit! The Qing Dynasty people's ability to tamper with things was really clever, changing "dozens of copper guns" into thousands of copper coins, and changing "then entered the sea from Xujiakou" into "returned to Xujia to rob greatly." This change was not enough to make sense, so they added the sentence "leaving nothing behind, the poor people cried in the open air!"</p>
<p>Also, when the righteous soldiers of the outer Weigang fought fiercely with Liang Desheng, Jiang Bing won a great victory. The manuscript describes it in great detail:</p>
<p>"At that time, our army was almost defeated, but the soldiers from Weigang and Loutang joined the battle with great force. Zou Su was known as a bandit. He was brave and dared to fight. He killed the blacksmith. In a few moments, soldiers from all the villages gathered in a crowd, competing to burn Liang Desheng's ships, and Li Chengxie burned all the fine gold, beautiful jewels, famous swords, and precious sabers he had obtained from Weiyang, Jinling, Kunling, and Jingkou, and all that had not been destroyed was looted by the villagers. Many women were carried in the ships and were burned miserably. Among them was a woman who was most beautiful, who shouted, 'I am the daughter of a Hanlin official, and my home is in Yangzhou. I was captured here. Please save me!' The villagers all said, 'Jump into the water!' The woman cried, 'My feet are locked and I can't escape!' Before she could finish her words, the raging fire burned her feet! The smoke covered the sky, and the red light shone for more than ten miles. It did not die out until dawn. Desheng fled east at night, escaping in a sorry state."</p>
<p>How brave and valiant the righteous soldiers' attack and arson were! The people of the Weigang area are still very tough to this day. Ordinary bandits, when the great era comes, stand up and become heroes of righteousness and courage. Ancient and modern times are the same, but the published version, which has been tampered with by the Qing people, only says a few words: "At dawn, Desheng's soldiers' heads were captured, a total of eighty. Desheng's remaining men fled east, escaping in a sorry state."</p>
<p>During the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, there were countless places where the Qing people tampered with and manipulated the truth in works of national consciousness. This "Record of the Massacre in Jiading" is also an example.</p>
<h3>The Distance Between Two Eras</h3>
<p>— Meng Qi</p>
<p>Once, a letter said that even in the countryside, the consultation fee was still too expensive, and it was not effective, so he was taking "immortal prescriptions." Although my father had limited scientific knowledge, he was usually extremely opposed to superstition. My mother was also a very sensible woman. To not take medicine and instead take "immortal prescriptions" was only to save money. Perhaps my father's illness was delayed because of this, which is another thing that I will regret for the rest of my life!</p>
<p>My father truly carried on his fatherly duties to me. When I was still studying in the second year of university, the family's economic situation was unable to support my tuition due to a sudden change in circumstances. (The cost of that school was the second highest in the country.) But he always tried every means to make me continue my studies happily, and he never wanted me to know about the difficult situation. I remember that at that time, there were many miscellaneous expenses in the school. Whenever others paid, he always tried his best to find a way to give it to me. At that time, I didn't know anything. Later, when I asked him, he said that it wasn't for the sake of saving his own face, but rather to avoid spoiling the self-esteem of young people. I also remember that one year, my father's expression seemed very uneasy during the day on New Year's Eve, but when he lit the big candles to worship the ancestors in the evening, my father regained his gentle expression, persuaded us to drink, and told jokes that were difficult but not very funny. Later, my father and mother and I "bid farewell to the old year." He took out the New Year's money for me with a bright expression, saying, "Buy something you like." I was only a teenager at the time, and I could vaguely "read faces and discern colors," and I could see that my father must have some secret worries. I asked my mother repeatedly, and my mother slowly told me that it was because he didn't have the New Year's money. My father hesitated for a long time, and finally took his beloved jade Ruyi out to "pawn" it. The next day, on "the first day of the New Year," my father's most beloved jade Ruyi was indeed gone from the altar. I was so moved by this that I cried several times. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Our Work in Wengyuan</h3>
<p>— Man Lei</p>
<p>After we left Guangzhou, we arrived in Wengyuan, located on the border of the Beijiang River in northern Guangdong.</p>
<p>Wengyuan is an important and abundant county in the Beijiang River area. The mountains are very steep, and there are roads everywhere that lead directly to the northeast Beijiang area. Obviously, it is a remote and poor place, but there are very vast fields here, and the villagers all make a living by farming. There are also several primary schools and important institutions in the county; there is also a poor relief center. However, after the unprecedented bombing by × people's planes for two or three days on October 15th and 16th, nine out of ten shops in the city were empty, and the entire city of Wengyuan and the small market town became a field of rubble. Our working group lived near Huangtang Township, outside Wengyuan City, no more than a stone's throw from Wengyuan City. The × planes bombed mercilessly day after day, and the villagers fled in droves. There are many ancestral halls and dilapidated houses standing here, with many words such as "Yingsu Residence," "Daifu Residence," and "Zhifeng Residence" engraved outside the ancestral hall doors, as if embellishing the collapsed palaces of ancient Egyptian birds. From this, it can be inferred that many ancestral halls have a long history. Our bedrooms are very simple, tidy, and clean. We bought dry straw for a small amount of money from the villagers and spread it on the ground, and we could sleep soundly.</p>
<p>We have several symposiums, small group meetings, discussion meetings, review meetings, etc. every week. Sometimes, the team leader had us practice night marches and guerrilla tactics. During the day, we set out to work. Whenever we arrived at a small village or market town, we would gather a group of villagers and explain the importance of the people saving the country, or we would take advantage of the days when the market was held. Taking advantage of this crowded place, we would start individual conversations with them, or use the method of family visits, using the simplest and most popular tone to explain to them the madness of the × people's bombing and expose the unscrupulous activities of the traitors. The work we launched with the villagers of Qingxian County focused on propaganda, text, pictures, singing, drama, and other work. Although some of them were illiterate or villagers with shallow knowledge, they never understood the meaning of resisting the war and saving the country. However, they were very sympathetic and enthusiastic about the wounded and rescued on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The noteworthy things about our work in the past two months are probably the following: (1) Actively promote the people in various townships and districts, organize the people, and train the people to participate in the patriotic groups and self-defense groups to protect their homes and defend the country. (2) Contact the Baotjia chiefs of various townships and districts; Unite with the villagers in five phases, (3) Find the target of the work center, (4) Make the words popular and simple so that they can understand them. The above four points are indispensable prerequisites for today's people's movement work. Young people who are interested in the people's movement today should pay more attention to this aspect.</p>
