<h3 id="c1">歐洲戰雲與蘇日衝突 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>這幾天國際情勢緊急萬分，最為聳動世界聽聞的有三件事，第一是歐洲戰雲的又趨濃厚，第二是蘇日衝突的益形緊張，第三是日本對英法美的威脅與勒索。除第三事件業經本報迭加評論，無待贅述以外，謹就第一第二事件，略抒所見，以告吾各界同胞與友邦人士。</p>
<p>首言歐洲戰雲，自從慕尼黑會議以後，一般盲目的頑固的論客，雖曾嘖嘖贊美乂乂乂妥協政策對於世界和平的供獻，我們則非但不能苟同此種見解，並曾懇切指出，法西斯侵略者貪得無厭，得寸進尺，任何妥協退讓政策，不僅不能和平苟安，而且必然助長乂人氣焰，增漲世界戰爭危機。最近英法政府承認西班牙叛軍政權，我們更不得不指出其對於法西斯侵略者的帮助，和對於世界正義和平的危害，我們不得不指出法西斯進攻英美法重分世界的二次大戰發展到更嚴重階叚。現在事勢發展，大致不出預料。今日各報所載路透社倫敦電卽稱：「當茲歐洲各界對歐局仍多堅持樂觀態度之際，竟有可靠消息，證實意大利，里比亞，及吉布堤港附近意軍之調動，及德國境內神秘軍隊秘密出動，儼然與霍德森前在奧林比亞之演說相吻合，至足使人驚駭。」又訊：「法意均積極準備其在突尼斯及里比亞之邊防。法國名記者波地納斯在英法協會演說稱，英法必須在紅海方面合作，以防止歐洲戰禍之發生，蓋意大利現在正準備在菲洲發動戰爭，倘任意在紅海區域獲得局部勝利，則英法勢必被迫而宣戰。關於德方企圖，謠言百出，據一般觀察，多謂德國似將藉要求舊殖民地為制止戰爭之交換條件，但德國頃正大舉調動其軍隊，各國政府對此至為焦急」。德意兩大法西期侵略者已在英法兩國妥協政策下準備展開更驚人的胃險行動，以挑發戰爭，威脅民主和平各國，重新分割世界，已是不能掩飾的秘密。</p>
<p>次言蘇日衝突，原非新聞，不過在此西方侵略者加緊推進大戰危機之際，日本侵畧者極力發動對蘇挑釁，便覺得更可注目。據路透社四日倫敦電傳，「消息靈通方面多以為蘇日漁約糾紛實比歐洲時局較易引起戰事，而日本此次遣派軍事代表團訪問軸心國家，似卽與此點危險有直接關係。」該電又稱「德方對波蘭反德運動所持態度如是平和，則里比亞，突尼斯邊界問題及蘇俄遠東漁塲糾紛，寔不能不更予以重視』，由此可見國際上對于蘇日衝突的態度。又據路透社四日長春電稱：「今晨蘇偽軍隊又在滿洲里北之邊境發生戰事，聞蘇偽邊境形勢較前更緊張。」我們對於這一事件，至少應有下列幾點基本認識，卽第一，今日日本不僅沒有進攻蘇聯而取勝的力量。而且也沒有發動眞正反蘇　爭的决心，從張鼓峯事件的對蘇屈服卽可證明。第二，今日蘇日紛爭完全是日本統治者加强對德意勾結。威脅及餌誘民主列强，以遂行其獨霸太平洋野心的基礎；第三，日方最近還不斷利用蘇日紛爭事件以對內掩飾侵華的敗績，及緩和國內及軍隊的反戰情緒。所幸蘇聯當局對於日本侵略者陰謀，曾經不斷地加以無情揭發，張鼓峯事件以後，並曾迭予日偽軍挑釁行動以打擊，現在全蘇聯邦人民一致準備反擊任何侵略者的進攻，而其國防力量及在國際上的威信亦日益增長，所以日本對蘇挑釁的結果，遭受威脅與損害的不是蘇聯，而將是日本侵略者自己！</p>
<p>不問為歐洲戰雲抑為蘇日衝突，我們分析其基本原因及其發展狀態、，卽可獲得以下的結論。卽：（一）在英法妥協政策繼續施行之下，國際法西斯侵略者將更加猖狂，進攻英美法重分殖民地的第二次世界大戰已臨於更嚴重的階段；（二）東方侵略者日本已經利用這個新形勢，利用虛張聲勢的反蘇戰爭，一面策應意德在歐菲兩洲的胃險行動，一面爭奪英美法荷名國在太平洋的權益；（三）在此新的嚴重階段，民主和平各國尤其是英法兩國，已經臨於歧路，代表金融資本家的少數統治者仍在繼續進向以妥協政策陷國家於危亡之路，廣大羣衆則在革命政黨及進步人士的領導下展開反妥協反法西斯的鬥爭；（四）蘇聯和平政策在國際上的威信大大增加，於張鼓峯事件及近來迭次發表反對法西斯侵略援助民主和平勢力之後，尤為明顯。甚至一向接近德國的波蘭亦已認淸此點而轉變態度，英國政府亦在此種事實教訓及國內羣衆呼號之下，不得不重新考慮英蘇關係的調整。</p>
<p>根據上述結論，我們更可明白挽救當前危局的鬥爭途徑：第一，我們明白今日世界大戰的性質，是法西斯侵略者進攻民主和平各國重新分割世界的戰爭，被攻擊日目標主要的是殖民地半殖民地，是擁有殖民地及半殖民地上一切權益的英美法各國，因此不問在歐州非州或太平洋，英美法各民主和平國家均應迅作更進一步的團結。第二，法西斯發動的新的世界大戰將危害殖民地半殖民地及一切弱小民族，將以全世界被壓迫大衆為犧牲，因此一切弱小民族及被壓迫大衆勞苦大衆，均應團結起來建立統一戰綫反抗法西斯反抗侵略戰爭；第三，中國和西班牙的政府與民衆堅决表示繼續為求民族解放與維護世界和平與民主而與法西斯侵畧者作殊死鬥，一切民主和平國家的政府與人民，一切被壓迫民族及勞苦大衆，均應團結起來切實援助中國與西班牙續繼抗戰；第四，法西斯推進中的新的大戰危機，顯與蘇聯的和平政策及民族獨立解放政策背反，同時又和蘇聯及全世界勤勞大衆的利益相　反，蘇聯為此已經並更加積極地領導着反法西斯反侵略的統一戰線的鬥爭，這種鬥爭顯然應該而且必須獲得一切民主和平國家及愛正義愛自由的人士的熱烈擁護與支持。法西斯侵略者新的胃險計劃已經在遠東而且卽將在歐洲展開了一切民主和平國家，一切弱小民族和被壓迫大衆，一切無產勞苦大衆，均應團結起來，在反法西斯反侵略的旗幟之下，為永遠的正義與自由而戰！</p>
<h3 id="c2">華僑在安南 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 沅雲</p>
<p>安南的風光與華僑　話到安甫，大家便會聯想到歷史上諒山之戰打勝仗求和割地的故事、可是想不到在今天、這個民族史上恥辱的地方、竟成為長期抗戰國際通路的大動脉、由海防經同登到龍州、由海防經河內到河口、是通到雲貴川桂各省的捷徑、所以、當時的交戰國不是意大利、不是德意志而是法蘭西、說起來又算是不幸中之大幸了、</p>
<p>在安南第一個印象最使人好感的就是他們的市政、尤其是河內、那直挺挺的柏油馬路、兩勞直挺挺的綠樹、中間一列直挺挺的街燈、左右兩排約等于馬路二分之一寬的行人路、再加上綠茵嫩草的穿挿、以及淺灰色淺黃色的洋房建築、眞奸像是處身于園林之中、而不覺都市的嘈雜、假如你在黃昏的時候、從Bulevard路穿出劍湖徜徉在劍湖的一角懷抱中、靜聽對湖飛過來的緋色音樂、跳望一下在燈光雲霧下的虹形紅　宮殿室的咖啡廳、微風送過來一陣陣的古廟鐘聲、包管你有如在北平中南海或頤相園昆明湖前的感覺、這種安閒恬靜的景象、並沒有濃厚的銅　氣味、也沒有十足的西方色彩、而是蘊孕着中國氣派的人生態度、一種人工與自然和諧的美、</p>
<p>在安南、第二個印象接觸到的是安南人、在我的印象裏。安南人是和檳榔分不開的、在諒山、在同登、在海防、許多安南人都有着一排黑齒、口不停嚼的吃檳榔、吐出一口口的血水、女人都開胸襟繫上布帶、男人則穿着半截黑長衫××××××××××一到河內一景况便大大不同、革履西裝的安南男人、綢衣白褲的安南女人、那種文雅的神氣、並不亞于中國的摩登仕女、安南人的　實不强、女人尤弱不勝屬、再加上她們那種嬌媚的裝束、腦後披着一束柔髮、上身穿着緊湊的薄紗、下面套着白綢褲、雙飄　繫上一對露趾的拖鞋、行起路來、驟然地、完全符合中國古畫上仕女的神態、無怪乎中國人來到這裏要大喝其采、自願與安南人仝化了、</p>
<p>在安南、第三個印象碰見的就是華僑、我們一入安南、不通言語、不識路徐、所以能够到處暢行無阻的、完全是靠華僑的指引、在馬路上、我們看見商店上有『廣』字的招牌、「福」字的招牌、就是廣東人、福建人開的商號、根据這個原則來購物問路、百無一失、在河內、火車站街，廣東街、福建街都是華僑商業的中心、在海防、華人街、東京街也是僑胞的叢集地點、僑胞一見面、問的不是天氣，不是行情、多半是抗戰的消息、他們的關懷國事、由此可見、</p>
<p>在安南的華僑、以粵人為最多、間人其次、桂浙人又次、華僑一切的事業及公共機關、都在廣東人的手裏、河內、海防南定只有廣東帮回福建帮、兩帮尚能融洽合作、共優公益、西貢一帶、光是廣東人便有廣府、四邑潮州、東莞南路、客家專帮別、合作精神遠不及河內海防、帮長制度由來已久、帮長二年或三年一任、帮長資格必須為本地華僑殷富熱心公益事業、捐輸中於僑胞，德齒俱茂的人、有的地方、帮長由華僑選出、再請地方政府承認、有的坤方帮長由政府國定數人、再交華僑選定，後者的情形極少、帮長的唯一任務、便是替法政府收稅、華僑的身稅（每年十六元五角）各商店的牌照稅由帮長彙集轉交越地當局、華僑有帮長選舉權及被選舉權的限于領有商業牌照的商店、每商店僅有一票、選舉的地點、在市政廳、歷年的選舉均無賄弊喧奪等情事、做帮長的人可以免去自己商業的牌照稅、和所有家人伏計的身稅、此外、越政府並酌予薪俸、年約千至二千元、概從華僑稅收方面抽給、但是、做帮長的人均為富有之戶、志不在錢、故薪倖多捐做公益事業、或捐助學校或捐助醫院、或捐會館慈善費、華僑最講面子、做帮長最有面子、故殷富者願意祖任一任帮長後、便撒手不幹、做帮長要出得起錢、要管街坊的事業、好的帮長常常是捐錢最多見義勇為的帶長、海防的前任廣東帮長黃荔洲先生、現任帮長羅偉基先生、都是熱愛祖國的人物、人緣也還不錯、聽說西貢方面、分帮太多、有此頭腦淸醒的人悟于僑胞分帮的非計、進行合帮運動、但為法越當局所阻扼、認為此種傳統習慣不必更動、免生枝節、在統治者的心目中、華僑的組織越分化越好、這種統一」的要求、是他們大不贊成的、</p>
<p>在河內、有一部份福建的華僑約一二百人、因為歷代世居安南的緣故、其妻其族、都是安南人、他們的兒女也都是安南的裝束、他們不承認他們自己是福建人，而別自來一個組織、叫做盟鄉會、介于福建人與安南人之間、以示區別、他們納的牌照與身稅都照安南人的辦法、每年可較華僑所納的減少一半不止他們的孩子進安南學校、他們的家庭及生活習慣找不出一些中國人的型式、可是河內的福建會館、原先又是他們發起建築的、至今他們和會餌的關係、只有大后聖誔日來燒香禮拜一下、這種忘本的潛移、很值得我們的杞憂、好在這種人只是極少數、不　、海外的華　、說他　處都是、又到處都不是了、</p>
<p>華僑和安南人的通婚並不怎樣流行、大概以福建人為多、廣東人長大了必回祖國一次、結了婚冉出來、這裏婦儒老弱的身稅極、每年只要一元多錢、故不為家累、僑胞並不怎樣看重安南人、這大約是傳統的關係、然而事實上、××××××××××××××、隨地小便、滿地吐檳榔汁、好吃懶做、荏弱畏事、好像生成給人　治的模、我有一次參觀河內博覽會、　見正廳中有一付金色大宇的對聯、上聯說、</p>
<p>「縱有為、何必登高山望遠海」、下聯說、</p>
<p>「府無事、不妨飮　酒近婦人」、亡國之音、活現紙上、××××愚民政策　算是登峯造極了、</p>
<p>在安南的華僑、他們的休閒生活×、海防的華商會館有黨部的閱書報社、只有幾份沓港報、、大約看的報紙、總是四五天前的新聞、西貢有中國報、辦理並不見起色、海防　僑近來也有人計劃辦一種報紙、但是因為機噐進口、關稅太高、所以遲遲沒有見諸事實、華商總會的組織現在籌備中、聽說不久就可以成立、這也是安南華僑的一榕值得報吿的大事！</p>
<h3 id="c3">一個血和淚的紀念大會 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— （氐江特訊）　林衡</p>
<p>「各位同志」陳君也是最受感動的一昌、用堅實的聲調、他開始說話、一瞧吧、太陽的一邊給烏雲蓋上　這象徵着日寇的死亡　快要到了、另一邊象徵看、中國有光明的前途、抗戰勝利就在我們的前面、同志們、笑起來吧笑吧」、陳君以手作着號召的姿勢、他自己苦笑起來了、有人跟着他哭但聲很小、但也有人好像沒有聽到陳君的說話似的、依然在那裏靜相、何君的視線集中在對面上的堡壘上好久都沒有移動、馬君低　頭、譚君不知從什麼時候起　集中視線到鋼帽裏了、梁、王、嚴同志還是哭的不停、　出白色的手巾偷偷地在抹着她們的熱滬、梁君看一看抹淚後的手巾忽然奮與地將它藏起來、似乎心裏在說、「我要留此淚痕以為紀念」、</p>
<p>「紀念「一、二八」我們要檢討世界現勢、全中國的形勢東江的形勞和目前存在的嚴重危　、我們本身的組織有否危機、有什麼缺點……我們應當英勇地承認我們的弱點、把它克服過來……紀念「一、二八」我們的任務是堅持持久戰、在東江佈置游擊根據地……紀念「一·二八」我希望各同志努力克服自己的弱點……紀念「一·二八」我號召同志們明天來一個總的檢討大會、澈底地檢討過去的工作、作風、用總的檢討會來紀念今天的紀念大會、」</p>
<p>「擁護」不約而同的一羣靑年一齊叫出了這個口號</p>
<p>四、在歸途中</p>
<p>「血！血！血敎訓了一切！永遠不忘今天的血和淚的紀念會！用總檢討會紀念今天的大食！紀念「一·二八」我們要誓死為戰士報仇為民族解放而奮鬥……」</p>
<p>「起來不願做奴隸的人們……」叫了口號，唱起義勇軍進行曲這一羣靑年一步一步的走下飛鵝嶺，歌聲唱得比平時壞，無力唱畢又是一場靜默，過了許久高君吿訴大家一眞的我一生沒有像今天這樣的受感動過呀！接着許多人都　頭同意，接着韓君說：「這血和淚的紀念大會我們要把它傳達給總隊部，給全體同志，給全國同胞還要給全世界的人們！我們要將它寫成通訊使一切的讀者讀了也像我們一樣的悲奮落淚那就好了……」</p>
<p>還是少有人說話，比出發時的情形完全兩機，帶看悲奮的心情他們慢慢地步入抗先惠陽縣隊部。</p>
<p>于惠城「一·二八」後三天</p>

<p>目前敎育上一般辯論最熱烈的問題就在戰時敎育和正常敎育的問題、亦就是說、我們應該一概打破所有正軌敎育的制度呢、還是保持着正常的敎育系統、而參以非常時期的方法呢、關於這一個問題、我個人的意思、以為解决之道、很是簡單、我這幾年來常常說「平時要當戰時看、戰時要當平時看」、我又說、一戰時生活、就是現代生活、現在時代、無論個人或社會、若不是實行戰時生活、就不能存在、就要被人淘汰滅亡」我們若是明瞭了這一個意義、就不必有所謂常時敎育和戰時敎育的論爭、我們因為過去不能把平時當作戰時看，所以現在纔有許多人不能把戰時當作平時看、這兩個錯誤，寔在是相因而至的、我們决不能說、所有敎育都可以遺世獨立、於國家需要之外、關起門戶、不管外邊環境、甚至外敵壓境了、還可以安常蹈故、一些不緊張起來、但我們也不能說、因為在戰時、所有一切的學制課程和敎育法令、都可以擱在一邊、因為在戰時、我們就把所有在學的靑年、無條件的都從課室寔騐室研究室裏趕出來、送到另一種境遇裏、無選擇無目的地去做應急的工作、我們需要兵員、必要時也許要袖調到敎授、或大學專科學生、我們需要各種抗戰的幹部、我們不能不在通常敎育系統之外、去籌辦各種應急人才的訓練、但同時我們也需要各門各類深浩的技術人才需要有專精研究的學者、而且尤其在抗戰期間、更需要着重擴大各種基本的敎育、我們為適應抗戰需要、符合戰時環境、我們應該以非常時期的方法、來達成教育本來的目的、連用非常的精神，來擴人敎育的效果、這是應該的、譬如我們各級學校、在戰時要力求設備方面的節約、起居方面的簡單和刻苦、我們看前人畫荻敎子、用如此簡單的</p>

<p>（由第二版轉來）</p>
<p>敎具、也可以敎出有名的人物，有如囊螢映雪、也不廢讀書、這是我們戰時師生所應該取法的、以及學生訓練方面、課目範圍的擴大、與不必要課程減少的社會敎育方面、對于學校機關人力的儘量利用、這些問題、可以舉一反三、不能枚舉、</p>
<p>總而言之、我們切不可忘記戰時應作平時看、切勿為應急之故、而就忘却了基本、我們這一戰、一方面是爭取民族生存、一方面就要於此時期中、改造我們的民挨、復與我們的國家、所以我們敎育上的着眼點、不僅在戰時、還應當看到戰後、我們要估計到我們國家要成為一個現代的國家、那麼、我們國民的知識能力、應該提高到怎樣的水準、我們要建設我們國家成為一個現代的國家、我們在各部門中、需要有若干萬的專門學者、幾十萬乃至幾百萬的技工和技師、更需要幾百萬的敎師相民衆訓練的幹部、這些都要由我們敎育界來供給的、這些問題、都要由我們敎育界來解决的、關於敎育一切具體節目的問題、我不及，一一提出來討論、我希望諸君着眼到最基本的一點、這就是要堅定我們全國抗戰的意志、建立我們建國的精神尤其是要時時刻刻提高我們民挨固有的道德、大家都知道、我們楚物質條件一切欠缺的國家、處在這樣危險困難的時期、還要負荷起這樣非常重大的責任、若不是以精神勝過物質、就不能求得抗戰的勝利、若不是利用我們固有道德和革命的精神、若不由此精神產生出力量、創造出物質、就沒有法子達到建國的成功、况且×人現在所千方百計以求的、是要打擊我們的精神壓倒我們的精神、消滅我們民族固有的道德和革命的精神、使我們民族生命無听寄托、因此目前最急的需要首先在於精神的振作與集中、最近中央提出，國民參政會决定實施精神總動員、目的就在强化我們全國的精神、以負起抗戰建國的時代使命、不久就要定出辦法、推行全國、這一個重大責任、希望我們全國敎育界人士、毅然祖當、以身作則來倡導各界、普遍力行、古人娩、「化民成俗、其必由學』、敎宵界的一言一動、無不影響於社會的風氣、這幾十年來的革命運動、沒有一次不由于敎育界熱烈倡導、以底於發揚光大的、今天更不是起衰振敝的問題、而是得之則存失之則亡的問題、我們必須發揚我們民族固有的精神道德、激起全民挨的獨立目尊性、喚起全民族對侵略我們滅亡我們的××、有同仇敵愾的犧牲决心，樹立起全民族對革命前途和國家的將來、有深切的自信心、從而鼓勵起向前進取積極奮鬥的决心、而後我們這一個廣人悠久的民族、續能從千辛萬苦當中、孕育出光明燦爛的新生命、我以為我們國家釗了今天、一切敎育者的生活、應該再不是從前閉戶敎書、優游自在的淸閒生活、敎育者不應該紙是按照學程、傳習知　　識、視為個人的一種生活根據或私人職業、今天的敎育家、應該自認為衝堅折銳的前線戰士、應該自認為移風易俗的社會導師、應該自認為路藍縷的開國先驅、應該自認為繼絕存亡的聖賢英傑、</p>
<p>今天我們再不能附和過去誤解了許久的敎育獨立的口號、使敎育者謹守國家法令和國家所賦予的責任以外、而成為孤立的一羣、我以為到今天我們來談敎育、應該使敎育和軍事政治社會經濟一切事業相貫通、怎麼樣使敎育和軍事相貫通呢、我們要造成所有學生都有衛國自衛與自治治國的意識和本能、未及齡的學生，要使長成起來能服國家的兵投、適齡的學住、要使國家必能微調時，就能應徵入伍，沒有徵調時、要使每人有一種可以担任抗戰有關工作的技藝、怎麼說敎育興政治相貫通呢、學記上說、「為之師、然後為之長」、古代的師資、就是各層政治幹部所從出、今天我們的敎育者、也應當担任起訓練民衆和組織民衆的責任、怎麼說敎育和社會相，通呢，近來常總到學校敎育人員視　辦社會敎育為長途、我以為經費時間精力固然要有過當的考慮、但是根本說起來、學校敎育决不能離開社會、古人說、「相觀而為之庫」、我們社會一般同胞感受痛苦、我們决不忍漠視、就是為達成敎育的目的、勿使近墨者黑、也應該開發社會民衆的國民常識、以改善學校的環境、怎麼說敎育和經濟相貫通呢、這更是我們建國計劃中一個要點、我們要根據國家經濟建設的需要、敎授國民、重勞動、能生產、尤其鼓勵創造的能力、一切教育計劃、要與經濟計劃相配合、而後我們教育機能成為現代國家生命力所由造成的一個因素、</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>在常德單槍獨馬，街頭巡禮，忽有意外機緣，碰着睽別十年的舊友劉崇仁金屋二君及另一新交徐君，彼此像見着平空打落×機似的非常高興，便一道約着去「京蘇菜館」吃午飯，藉作久別重逢之暢叙。不料剛動筷向頭盤凉菜進攻，突聞警報嗚嗚長鳴，其他顧客均紛紛下樓，我們也只好追踪前賢，下樓奪船渡江（沅水岸邊，繫有許多小船，供人渡江避難，但不能自行鼓槳者，中途蕩漾江心，目標暴露，反遭機槍射殺），在對岸墳壩里喝了半個鐘頭的西風，才得折回來吃新添上些香料——×彈震落灰塵的凉菜，這無異警覺我們：「吃飯勿忘國難！」</p>
<p>京蘇菜館窻几明凈，招待殷勤，在內地飯館中，獨具特殊風格。據說：該館是由許多有能為的蘇州難民，一本「有錢出錢，有力出力」的原則，最近才集股新開的。其組織，高等難民荷包裏還有法幣，當然晋級為股東老板；中等難民有的是高等的近親，或是交際女性，或是易牙門徒，則分任賬房，買辦，招待及廚司；其餘沒具備高中兩等條件的另一等，則概行紆貫降尊，分祖送菜，洗鴛，打雜等事。當初我想：他們——人是蘇州人，話是蘇州話，菜也是什麼十慘景，獅子頭等十足的蘇州風味；率性將館名改成淸一色的「蘇州菜館」，不是風頭還要來得更健麼？然而他們不這樣的改，後來才院得耶穌自有道理。</p>
<p>提到該館的女招待，也許有人會猜想：準是和她們老鄉林黛玉，或者同業卓文君一類富有誘惑性的神秘女郎。其實她們幷無半點神秘性，亦無故意婀娜作熊的誘惑性，她們却是爽爽利利地替你上菜，一本正經地倍你談笑。而且有的和你正談笑得高與的時候，她會突然倒豎起柳眉，將兩　彷彿半開式牙骨扇的雙掌『砰』然合攏，好像已捉得世間最可恨的什麼東西，要將它在掌心中輾得粉碎似的竭大磨擦幾下，復又在輕微的嘆聲中趕快將雙掌分開。朋友，假若你不是月球上的仙子，而是中華民國的大國民，那你一定能立刻意識到：她是和你同樣抱着家仇國恨的時代女性哩。</p>
<p>在那天的席上，記者曾向具有如此標準風範的一位女招待，用反擊的方式問她：『格里斗意交關好，阿想回蘇州去？』這句「班鬥弄斧」的蘇州話，居然收到拋磚引玉的效果：</p>
<p>『為　弗想囘去！』但她似乎知道我未曾領過「蘇州語學專校」的文憑，第二句便用普通話滔滔不絕地說：「我們是在前年的冬上，就離開可愛的家鄉！州了！動身的時候，因聽見很密的槍聲，嚇得連行李都沒收齊，便從鄉下逃出。路上才曉得×人尚未打到蘇州，那是紀律向來很壞的劉××部隊搗鬼的。後來受盡千辛萬苦，才逃到武漢。繼又南下長沙。喘息方定，情勢又吿緊張，復被疏散到這里來。逃難逃了三四省，什麼都典盡吃光，若不是弟弟擦皮鞋三毛兩毛地混着過，那我們老早就在漢口沒辦法了……囘憶我們可愛的家鄉——蘇州，她那里有我們的錦繡山河，有我們的田園盧墓，有我們的親戚朋友，尤其是有我那年邁蒼蒼的祖母，中途失散了的母親和妹妹；異鄉漂泊，每遇困難問題，眞想恨不能立刻挿翅飛囘蘇州，尋找着慈愛的母親，倒在她懷裏痛痛快快地哭訴一場，縱死也甘心！</p>
<p>『可是，後來愈想愈弗對；』她的語調，突由悽婉轉成激昂：柳眉也正在此時倒豎起來：「我們的家鄉還在×人漢奸們統治之下。×人在我們淪陷區殺了成千成萬的男同胞，難道這些男同胞都不是人嗎？强×我們無數的姊妹，難道她們是應該供給×軍摧殘的麼？如果我們此時再留然囘去，不是睜着眼睛跳火坑，再白白地送給×人去宰割污辱麼？那樣任人宰割污辱的悲慘情形，豈不超過逃難痛苦千萬倍？</p>
<p>「所以，旣來之，則安之。在未將×人趕走以前，我們縱漂泊一生，潦倒以死，也决不作回鄉當順民的傻夢；除非囘去當女游擊隊。又我們菜館之所以叫京蘇菜館，倒不因為專　京蘇的特菜，是要叫一般早晚到此吃飯的顧客們，觸目警心：若是我們老鄉，固不應樂不思『蘇』；就是他省同胞，亦不致輕忘失土……』</p>
<p>她這段幾乎純用血與淚一字字地交織成的談話，哀痛處是出自兒女柔情，悲壯處似出自英雄俠骨，同樣都能博得諦聽者的同情心，×愾心。她和她的姊妹羣中，在這次驚天動地的抗戰洪濤中，定能產生如左拉所著「納納」一書女主　同樣身世可歌可泣的人物，記者想多提出幾　——至少是有關難民實情的問題，再耐心地和她們暢談暢說；不過怕那三位朋友誤會，認為記者之意不在請客，在乎向蘇籍時代女性採訪。于是只好將話頭兜轉到他們三位身上來。</p>
<p>台兒　轟轟烈烈的勝利戰，保衛武漢的大刖山脉爭奪戰，他們三位都躬逢其盛，兩位還　有光榮的創傷。他們談起這幾次大戰是如何的激烈一，我軍是怎樣的英勇，眞是有聲有色，聽如身臨其境，不林精砷振奮，豪性遄飛。相反的，我們在第一期抗戰時，因武器稍遜于×，致便前線將士，有時不免作壯烈犧牲，我們也毫不加以掩飾地直說出來；但聽了幷不會使　折氣，同樣會使你更提高了對將士犧　精腳之崇敬心！</p>
<p>例如徐君滿情悲意的說：××軍來自某邊連省份，所部多　樸實忠勇的健兒，他們平時信仰精神戰勝物質的訓條，作起戰來，就是一股勇動的往前衝。如此當然能常收偉大的戰果，但也會蒙受慘烈的死傷犧牲。該軍參加台兒莊殲滬戰，能卓立助績，博得中外采聲，原因即在于此。</p>
<p>徐君就在該軍當任下級幹部。當該軍初用緊急夜行，增加台兒莊火線的次日拂曉，在晨光熹微之下，一切景物陌生之中，徐君隱隱有見前方的草叢裏，排列着幾個龜形的巨物，但辦別不出它們是什麼東西。恰好徐君部下有個姓王的班長，跑過地方不少，見識較廣，于是走去問他：</p>
<p>『王班長！你看：那是什麼鬼東西？』</p>
<p>『沒有什麼關係，那是山東　墓。』</p>
<p>可是說了不到三分鐘之後，那幾個『山東碑墓』會蠕蠕然走起路來，且在『閣閣閣』地冒出幾條火舌的掩護下，直向我方向地猛衝過來！</p>
<p>『媽的，這鬼東西大概就是坦克車了吧？我究不相信它會吞人！』王班長便奮勇跳。壕外，以手榴彈去歡迎那幾個眞是坦克車。其餘弟兄瞥見車後另有×兵　背跟進，也如蟄蛟　土，　虎下山地一致衝上前去，立刻展開了該省健兒第一次與外兵接觸的激烈肉搏戰！</p>
<p>這次劇烈肉搏的結果，雖然打了個偉大的勝戰，但也鬧了個可憐的笑話，卽目作聰明裝老腔的王班長之悮認坦克車為山東碑墓。然而這種以血肉與鋼鐵拚命的實例，不但未使台兒莊勝利光榮受其影響，甚且還使第一期抗戰戰果為之壯氣。總之，這是第一期抗戰勢所必肓的現象。若在自前的第二期抗戰，不　馳騁南北職場，我們有的是機械化部隊：他如消極防毒的化學部隊，積極採取攻勢的新銳空軍，都在以精進嶄新的　態，相繼開出前所未有的奇花，且將要結出一新世界觀聽的美果哩！</p>

<p>春天到，馬肥人健，正是戰鬥的季節。連日國際新聞，已經開始運用最聳人聽聞的戰鬥的字句，「緊張」，「嚴重」，「危急」！這些新聞吿訴我們：法西斯使略者怎樣更加瘋狂的在擴大界世戳爭的危機；令人驚駭不已；這些新聞也吿訴我們民主和平各國的覺醒與準備抵抗的情形，使人躍然興奮！除於今日社評中評述外，我們覺得還應列舉最近和平陣綫積極强化的事實。</p>
<p>第一，美國以實力支持民主國家的態度更明顯了。三月三日參議院辯論國防問題結果，孤立派的瓊遜與聶氏，已吿失敗，大部份議員擁護羅斯福鎮導的外交政策。同時於美國海軍大操之際，國務部方面同時進行與蘇英法比研究交換戰時原料問題。</p>
<p>第二，英國除積極擴軍及增强遠東防務以外，最近已在慮改進對蘇關係。雖然不能以此忽視英國統治者的眞面目，但英國為本身利害關係及全國人民要求，却將為推進英蘇合作的主力。同時英蘇的接近，至少將予中蘇合作以更好的條件。</p>
<p>第三，法國政府已在民衆一致要求下開始增厚北非與遠東兵力的步驟，並且切實聲明對殖民地問題决不讓步。革命及前進政黨領導下的人民陣線的力量，已在繼續增長，恢復法蘇合作之聲開始冉度昂騰。</p>
<p>第四，英法政府最近所取較進步的態度，雖然是在承認西叛軍後緩和人民反對運動的表現，但亦由此可見英法人民陣線力量已有重大發展。</p>
<p>第五，日本人民及台鮮各地反法西斯反侵略運動已在重重警備與鎭壓下陸續暴露，日本侵華軍隊內的反戰怠戰運動亦陸續發生。</p>
<p>此外，特別重要的是蘇聯領袖斯太林及全國紅軍的宣誓保衛祖國保衛和平，遠東國防力量的發展及海空軍力的增强，對於侵略者是一大打擊，對於民主和平是領導的主力。</p>
<p>這些事實增加我們勝利的信心與鬥爭的决心，我們要用加倍的努力去發展這種鬥爭。</p>

<p>本港婦女已經並正在努力救亡工作的固屬不少。她們在雙重壓迫下的鬥爭精神，頗多較男性更加備得敬佩，然而在總人數中究竟還只佔絕小的少數，其因無所事事而縱情於戀愛，迷信以至賭博者，為數當大可驚人。我們至少希望全部知識婦女立刻選定一種學習或服務社會與祖國的工作，我們至少希望婦女團體乘些三八婦女節前夕，多多發動落在救亡工作圈外的靑年婦女，讓她們走上為解放自己保衛自己而鬭爭的大路。</p>

<p>佛朋哥勝利之後，德意兩國的經濟潛勢力，當然更為加增，英法等民主國家，定必望塵莫及的！</p>
<p>這種法西斯的經濟力的伸張，遠在西班牙內戰之前，已經發動了。在一九三四年，意大利的銀行團和德意志的工業界派一個工程師，一個鑛學專家到伊比利亞半島（西班牙——譯者）去調查地質。果然棄與而去，也乘輿而返，他們發見了豐富的鑛藏，尤其是鎢，炭等主要軍用原料。那時剛剛是佛朗哥在摩洛哥叛變的時候。</p>
<p>德國看見　豐富的資源，遂思染指，這或許是德國幫助佛朗哥叛國的一個主要原因。佛朗哥佔據摩洛哥全境之後，遂統制整個庫洛哥的鑛業，由一家德國的希斯馬羅活公司司理輸出事宜。佛朗哥需要大量軍火去奪取政權，所以，以大量的生鐵運往漢堡，作為向德國購買軍火的交換品。那裏的生鐵出產，在戰前平均每月七萬噸，但在希斯馬羅活公司控制之下，已經增至十三萬噸了。</p>
<p>佛朗哥的軍隊，得到德意思機的協助向伊比利亞半島之北推進後，町頭的銅鑛，又落在德意兩國的手中了。在戰前，意大利和西班牙控制世界的水銀市塲，西班牙阿爾馬登是水銀出產最豐富的地方。意大利要據阿爾馬登為己有，目出意料之中。</p>
<p>在一九三七年，佛朗哥屢次向比爾波推進，就是想奪取那寥的鉄鑛；不消說，這也是德意所指使的。因此，希特勒那時在胡士堡的演講，有「希望佛朋哥勝利以後，奪取那處的鐵鑛」之語。</p>
<p>不過，這麼一來，就與英國衝突了。英國工業上所用的鐵多從西班牙輸來，為數約在三分之一以上。在比爾波地方，英國有三數家鑛業公司為北西班牙最大的阿路古那拉鑛務公司的股東，所以佛朗哥佔領比爾波之後，英政府立刻派出一個「商務使者」和佛朗哥政府交涉，維持英國在比爾波的權益，使那裏的鐵繼續運往英國，果然馬到成功。當年設立「不干涉委員會」，原來是玩弄這麼一套呀！</p>
<p>可是，話又得說囘來，佛朗哥眞不霑一份興德國嗎？用不着說，當然不是的，一九三七年十二月，單在巴斯傑港，就有三萬五千噸生鐵運往德國了。因此，一般人傳說，德英分霑比爾波的鐵鑛，未必空穴來風的。</p>
<p>此外，德國更在佛朗哥的佔領地帶建立工廠，如紡織中心的安打羅沙，就有德國資本設立的安打羅沙公司。摩洛哥的德段地方設立一家人造絲廠，和幾家煙草公司，也是德國資本的。漢堡船務公司又在西班牙設一支店。德國還計劃着西班牙的交通航空網，有許多航空綫已經完成，可以應用了。</p>
<p>德國的經濟勢力不斷的向西班牙伸張，意大利也步其後塵，來凑一下熱鬧。在米蘭，我見到意大利的商人，笑逐顏開，發着西班牙的戰爭財。意大利進口貨中的西班牙生鐵，從一九三六年的三萬三千噸增至十八萬噸（一九三七）；鐵片輸入則由三十二萬七千噸增至五十萬噸，；鎂則由二萬三千噸增至七萬五千噸。意大利的官　表示在一九三七年，從西班牙得到二萬二千噸黃鐵鑛。</p>
<p>在米蘭，我見到許多建築家，工程師，接到戰後西班牙的建造生意。據說：意大利的磁鐵，人造絲，橡皮等物品亦大量的運往西班牙銷售，羅馬更組織一個半官式的金融機關，以推進意國在西班牙的商務；最重要的就是意大利西班牙銀行的設立，總行設在羅馬，這就是意大利金融勢力向伊比利亞半島伸張的原動力啊！</p>
<p>據羅馬方面所傳，佛朗哥政府的組成，意大利政府曾派人助理；因此有人說，佛朗哥政府的內政外交，惟意大利的一馬首是瞻」。意大利派出許多政治密探往西班牙，意大利的秘密警察長博志尼，曾經親自到　西班牙；這是從政治方面入手，以收政治經濟侵略變管齊下之效！</p>
<p>但是，德意兩國勢力的伸張，會不會衝突呢？各方面有不同的意見，有人以為，它們旣是法西斯的信徒，又是柏林羅馬的軸心的合夥，當然不會衝突的。而且，不獨不會衝突，或者還聯合起來，排擠英法等民主國家在西班牙的旣得權益。在米蘭和羅馬，都有人吿訴我，英國的商人會借欵給佛朗哥，以作討價還價的。</p>
<p>據正月號的「倫敦金融新聞」所載：意大利在西班牙的投資為二十五億里拉，德國則為八億馬克。有人說佛朗哥想向英法舉債，以償還德意的債務，將原料留為已用。但是，德意一定反對的。</p>
<p>佛朗哥勝利之後，德意希望西班牙的經濟制度，也像他們的一樣，使德意西三國在經濟上携手。英法等民主國家就這樣退縮了？（譯自「新共和週刊」）</p>

<p>主持這些比較『合法』的募捐團體的，好像是「有點名氣」的人，對這些人，我們雖然不敢說他們是光棍之流亞，可是他們的無意識的行徑，不能不引起我們的懷疑。尤其是他們所招致的募捐者簡直太引起我們的反感。不久以前，有兩個募捐團體，派人四出勸捐，不錯，他們所標榜的募捐目的，是值得我們同情的，但是令人詫異也令人不滿的是：每一次跑來，代表一個新團體勸募的人物面孔都是我們所熟習的，他們每一次都會很流利地說出這一回勸募的目的，笑着臉鼓勵人們多盡一點兒力量。可是，他們的職業化了的勸募手法，已經不會引起一般人的同情心，反而加深對他們的厭惡了！</p>
<p>最近某籌欵救傷賑難的組織派出來的勸募人員，記者昨天在不同的地　碰到了兩批，果然不出記者所料，依然還是那些熟習的臉孔，老練的募捐手法，和娓娓動人的辭令。</p>
<p>我始終弄不消楚，到底「合法」的募捐團體本身職業化了呢，還是職業化了的勸募人員，把募捐團體職業化了！總之，無論如何，對正當的募捐前途，終是不會有良好的影響的。</p>
<p>我們不忍社會上的愛國人士，把有用的金錢，中飽這些社會的蟊賊的私囊，反而把抗戰的經濟力减低了。故此借這個機會，把這些事直率地坦白地吿訴與社會人士知這，希望同胞們捐欵的時候，要留心這幾點：</p>
<p>（一）募捐團體是否為合法組織。</p>
<p>（二）該團體的主持者是否可靠。</p>
<p>（三）欵額不論多少，總以逕交與銀行為最安全。</p>
<p>（四）對未勸捐者，應注意其是否為以勸捐為職業之徒，若然。對　要求宜加拒絕，蓋此輩所代表之任何「團體」，皆非經合法手續組織而成者，故不惜假募捐為犀利工具。</p>
<p>最後記者謹鄭重地向讀者聲明，我寫這篇東西的動機，目的祇想揭穿光唱們的詭計，然後社會人士踴躍捐輸的欽項，除了神聖的救國救亡的用途之外，不至於會跑進光棍們的口袋裏。但願社會人士此後對捐欽的途徑會有比較地正確切當的認識，更希望他們以後捐欵，能够愈益努力，千萬不要因為有壞蛋光棍從中搗鬼而灰心才好！</p>

<p>他說、『我們正在緬因的海濱、想拍一點『氣球跳躍』的新鮮把戲、方法是在人身上縛着十二個以上的大氣球、帶了這些氣球跑上一小段路、然後縱身一躍、氣球就可以把人體帶起、然後慢慢的冉落下來、</p>
<p>『我想帶了氣球跳過一輛汽車、這個需要更多的氣球了、加了又加、直到三十幾個之多、我曉得氣球太多了、正急忙設法解開幾个時、一陣風來、把我吹離了地面、越升越高、升到一百五十尺時、唯一把我和地面連結起來的繩索也斷了、不到一會我就升到了一千五百尺、而且還有繼續上升之勢、幸而吹着東北風、才沒有把我送到海面上去、我看見地下的夥伴們跳進汽車開始追趕我、而更運氣的是、我所飛行的路綫正和地下的道路平行、否則他們要趕我也無從趕起了、</p>
<p>『我升入了雲層裏連地下也看不見了、只聽見他們汽車的喇叭聲、追趕我的人越聚越多、我也越升越高、至三千尺的高度、飛入一堆雨雲、水氣凝結在氣球上、添上一些份量、我又降低到一千二百尺、這時候、追着我人們中間有一位牧師、是射擊的好手、他弄到了一枝來福槍、開始射擊那些氣球、眞虧了他的槍法神妙、把縛在我身上的五尺大氣球擊破了幾個、我才能脚踏實地的重回地上、要不是他射擊準確的話、那幾顆槍彈早可以送我的終而有餘了、』</p>
<p>這還不算、他還有一次、把自己縛在潛水艇的無線電竿上、拍攝潛艇潜入水中的實景、他和艇中人約定、當他對着潛望鏡打某種手勢時、艇中人就把艇身升起或沉下一些、先拍了艇面和炮塔沒入水中的情形、這是亳無困難的、他做了個手勢、更沉下一些、潜望鏡也沒在水面之下了、——這是最危險的——水面上祗露出他那支無線電竿、而水已經齊到他的腰部、他覺得他有估量一下自己能在水底下能耐多少時候不透氣的必要了、幸而潛艇也就浮出了水面、才沒有釀成溺斃攝影員的慘劇、事後他告訴人、『為覺得那時候應該是我拍攝潛艇潛航的最好（而且是最後）的機會了』、</p>
<p>做一個新聞片攝影員、為了工作上的便利、爬到摩天大樓的鋼架和鉄橋的　樑上、或竟是飛行中的飛機翼上去攝影、都是不足為奇的家常便飯、可是也有時候、能得到一個隨外交團體出訪外洋的好機會、像百代　業公司的鮑勃唐那休那樣、</p>
<p>在倫敦某次宴會、威爾斯王子、也就是温莎公爵也親自蒞臨、可是嚴禁攝　、唐那休退出餐廳寫了一張字條給王子、說『我是敝國特派的攝影員、為殿下與敝國外交人員攝影是我的職責、未知可蒙俯允否』回到飧廳、他設法把這張字條放在威爾斯王子的碟子裏、</p>
<p>飯後、唐納休得到一個機會和王子見面了、他說、『我就是寫方才那張字條的人、殿下可以允許我麼、』</p>
<p>威爾斯王子很奇怪的望了他一會、點點頭、而且邀了許多客人出來一同攝影、</p>
<p>幾年後、唐納休又被派往南美攝威爾斯王子的有聲新聞片、當他走近這位王子時、王子問他、『你就是上次在倫敦寫過一張字條給我的　、』看來威爾斯王子的記性不是錯的、</p>
<p>有時候、一些攝影以外的小技藝也能給予工作上莫大的便利、福斯慕維通新聞片攝影員巴奈飽戚爾就遇見過一次、他跳得一『脚一好却爾斯登舞、凑巧遇上前希臘王也是喜歡這個調調兒的、於是以教授跳舞為條件、讓他拍了好些影片、雙方交易、滿意而退、</p>
<p>西班牙王阿爾方朔也當過一次攝影昌的學徒、那是某次在加拉般莎騎兵大演習的時候、一位福斯慕維通攝影員隨往攝製新聞片、他是個體里約在一百十五磅左右的小瘦子、天氣熱得利害、而他抗着那架份量和他本人差不多重的攝影機步行、直壓得喘不過氣來、亞爾方朔看到他的窘態、招手問他、</p>
<p>『你的開麥拉能拆開麽、』</p>
<p>『能的、陛下、』</p>
<p>於是大皇帝陛下抗了一部份的攝影機、而他手下的一員大臣抗了三脚架、而且看起來皇帝陛下對這件工作很感興趣似的、</p>
<p>這位攝影員事後對人說、『我所經驗過驚險古怪的事情也不少了、可是有一个皇帝助我抗攝影機、總是個英大的光榮呢、』</p>
<p>越是重要的人物越能給與親切的合作、這是攝影員共同的信念、</p>
<p>羅斯福總統就從來不語拒絕攝影、他還常用電影術和他們談話、每次攝完後、他總愛問上一句、『怎樣、還來一次麽、』</p>
<p>前任總統柯力芝的夫人也是攝影迷、那些人替他又夫攝影時她也拿着一架機器混在他們一圈中忙着、有時總統走出了鏡頭範圍、或是那一個攝影員的膠片忽然用完了、總統夫人總能極力帮忙、這件事給了他們一個很好的印象、到現在也還有人記得、而胡佛總統也有過一次臨上車、為了要讓他們攝影、特意把火車延誤了一些時間、這些都是大人物不搭架子的好例子、</p>
<p>拍有些人的影片要費很大的事、即如嘉寶遊歐後歸來時那樣、同時也有人送　上門來、這就是那些饑饉人羣了、他們蠭湧到公司來、要求攝成新聞片、為的是可以在銀幕上喚起大衆的同情、</p>
<p>新聞片是禁止帶有廣告性質的鏡頭的、而已故煤油大王洛克斐勒却破過一次例、攝影員請這位大富豪在攝製時說兩句話、他說了、說過、『上帝保佑、上帝保佑每個人』之後、又添上一句『上帝保佑標準煤油公司』—那是他的產業—、本來末了這一句話是會　刪了去的、可是這一次却例外的保存着、所以各地的觀衆都能聽到他　句保佑自己產業的祝福語、</p>
<p>謀刺羅斯福總統那次攝影昌赫脫機緣湊巧、得到了當時全部　影、然而這是可遇而不可求的事、</p>
<p>『總統未到之前我已經把燈光佈置好了、』他說『總統九點鐘到達的時候、我已經推着　麥拉佔有了一個極好的地位、可是細統的車子適從相反的方向而來、以致我所拍到的祇是一個背影、於是我趕上去對總統說、「請轉過身來拍一張正面相、」</p>
<p>正在他說話時、總統轉過身來、兇手開了鎗、與總統同來的安東西麥克立刻應聲倒地、血濺上了這个攝影員的身上、警侏人員立刻上來園住總統、保護他向外走、而赫脫趕快囘到攝影機旁、於是他拍到了羅斯福總統出外、和兇手就逮的各種鏡頭、等到一切那平靜下來之後、他才知道、險哪、當時他所站的地位正是和鎗彈成一直綫的、　【未完】</p>

<h3 id="c71">再戰再勝　華聯蟬聯督憲杯　戰情緊張四比五聯先勝後敗 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天太陽似有點畏羞、常不肯露臉、然而氣候溫和、正是一個最適合於球人活動的良辰吉日、</p>
<p>午後三時三刻、在加山排演的足球好戲——督憲杯複　、看客萬下、塲而熱鬧、加以兩班名角、演出刻刻緊張、時時精彩、的是一幕大快眼福的佳劇、</p>
<p>我覺得、全局有三多、就是戰情變幻多、精彩鏡頭多看客刺激多、蓋在九十分鐘的競爭過程中、因雙方方有得失、　戰成一比零（西聯　華聯後）、一比一、二比一、二比二、三比二、三比三、三比四、四比四的七次拉鋸式相持不下的局面、直至最後五分鐘、華聯於猛攻之下、始多獲一球、奠定勝　、</p>
<p>此幕爭奪戰、西聯雖則一氣佔先、然以三比二完成前半節的工作、然而華聯均能於每次失球之後、急起直追、因此、整個戰局遂在追的緊張聲中、發生極大變化、總之、此幕謂為爭奪戰固可、謂為追擊戰亦無不可、</p>
<p>昨天我曾有這個掛評、「西聯不以告奴為中鋒、實是失策、而其此種排陣法、乃有利於華聯、吾固不欲見其再更動而臻於完善也、一我的意思、是指西聯前線如調告氏居中或再更動、便比原定的較好、而事實果然兌現了、雖而昨大告氏缺席、荷息又不見踪跡、但正因如此、其前　乃得人加更動而臻於完善、攻力之大、的是可怕、復信得過其前線如果依原定的全數登塲、、表演起來、未必比此更出色、</p>
<p>華聯得勝的因素、最顯而易見的是兩翼旁敲側擊法實比中央突擊法收效更大、在上半時所獲兩球、俱得力於兩翼、第一球乃廣森妙傳、而由德輝交給景祥射入的、第二球乃澄滔以高速率　側擊、高路打士捉不牢而脫出、復由景祥順水推舟、一蹴入網的、依此看來、可知在一場競爭中、欲求制勝、則善於利用兩翼是决不可少的戰略、但昨天華聯在上半時供給兩翼的活動機會很少、尤其澄滔方面、施展無多、祗側重於中路三角式傳遞、遂無法收效、不得不居先敗的地位、至於下半時所獲第三及第五兩球、亦兩翼直接與間接之功、而西聯所獲第一及第四兩球、亦得力於兩翼、</p>

<p>廖亞臣（九龍會）　懇地（海軍隊）　葛尼（米杜息）　佐治（九龍會）　奄巴臣（炮兵隊）</p>
<p>華聯前線勝五球而後方失四球、此種成功與失責的判別、至爲顯明、故對於守衛各將　功罪不可不論、依我所見、竟成在此役徒勞奔跑、却沒法細止奄巴臣的活動、因而奄氏侵犯的結果、十九使華聯瀕於危險、紹漢足傷　未全愈而出　大戰、蹴球力弱、衣演平平無奇、而榮應在中路與狄臣之爭奪、又輸一着、所以、　個的防　、破綻頗多、加以西聯前線聯絡　　、　而左攻忽而右襲、中路亦常受威脅、以致竟成與靈聖、但不敢輕身　　出擊、然靈聖　出很好、爲後方最出色的一員、天生雖常以巧　人、　失第四　是他弄巧反拙所效的、榮才除了失　三球、是因觀察力略欠敏捷、此外尚不錯、惟在此間初膺重任、因過於興奮、態度上不免少有慌張的表露、</p>
<p>我又見得、華聯前綫得前衛的供應、其效甚微、惟自尋出路的機會較多、然而前衛並非不欲多予供應、無奈西聯前　迅　的侵略、太令人可怕、所以他們有　防禦尚感不週、故越過中場的出擊供應、實在很少、反之西聯的狄臣、因掩護有力、　球出擊的作風、時時可以見到　、不過、西聯致敗原因、亦似在此點、為的是狄臣既常遠出、帕架與菲士窩打不能不同時上前、以事供應、然而全神注於進攻、使不免忽略防守、華聯前線一經找得出路、卽施以突擊、　常見狄臣為救不及、故所失五球、多半基此原因、由此可見前衛出擊、有利亦有弊、</p>
<p>以雙方實力論、華聯原較充厚、奪得最後勝利、固是應有的結果、惟因最初不能利用兩翼作傳送及側擊、以致進展吃力、陷於苦戰、倘若及早施此一着、或不致時時處在風雨飄搖中、而至最後九分鐘始取得勝利也、</p>
<p>開賽後的十分鐘內、華聯聲勢甚盛、前線五虎常在對方腹地蹂躪、祗以西聯守衛有方、無濟于事、</p>
<p>十五分鐘時、西聯發奮圖强、連作猛襲、卒由奄巴臣迫得角球、開來佳妙、葛尼迎球一頂、先開紀錄、</p>
<p>十六分鐘、華聯得開球之便、作排山倒海的總攻勢祗見煙塵滾滾中、德輝傳球景祥、景祥在人叢中一掃入網、一比一首次打個平手、</p>
<p>廿六分鐘、廖亞臣邊疆偷襲、切中恰好、佐治截得一送、葛尼適至、在離門廿碼外發射、榮材模不着、至是華聯又失一球了、</p>
<p>卅四分鐘、兆榮傳球左路、　滔單騎疾進、弄過畢力般、然後發射、為哥路打士拍出、景祥及時趕至、加上一脚、球兒直搗網窩、二比二再次打成和局、而情形緊張、亦可想而知了、</p>
<p>卅九分鐘、天生葛尼鷸蚌相持、球為狄臣所獲、在門前卅碼計施其冷箭、榮材不料有此一舉、又負一球、三比一完了上半時、</p>
<p>下半時十三分鐘、澄滔抄人邊境、傳中美妙、德輝伏兵城下、躍高一頂、果然中的、哥路打士無法施救、三比三又未分高下、座上迷民、看得神移魄蕩、</p>
<p>十八分鐘、景祥得球、打出去路、短傳前方、兆榮德輝變雙衝刺、烏列治畢力般攔阻不來、卒被德輝射入一只、四比三華聯反和為勝了、</p>
<p>廿六分鐘時、西聯的奄巴臣、連破重關、交球葛尼天生衝前糾纏、葛尼在底線傳送、懇地向球一衝、神仙難教、遂成　比四、向華聯還以顏色、戰局至此、精彩畢呈、</p>
<p>四十五分鐘、德輝快馬搶劫、送球兆榮、兆榮弄過守衛、是時烏列治等奔前阻擋、兆榮足智多謀、不射而交給廣森、乘虛而進、在門角一射而入、造成五比四的勝利、大戰旣完、港督主持頒獎禮、華聯除保待銀光閃閃的督憲杯一年外、每球員復得小銀杯一具　三呼之後共同下山、　（球場太歲）</p>

<p>— 黃凱音</p>
<p>當踏進了教堂的頃間，馬上便發生了一種低氣壓之感應，不禁虔誠地在胸前劃了一個十字。屛息着呼吸，忍耐着足下的聲音，偶然咳了一下，有了囘聲，便像犯了什麽似的慚愧着。</p>
<p>琉璃燈結了一朶金黃的火花。教堂中站立着的是懷抱着嬰孩，神態飛越的聖母，臉上流露出聖潔的凜然不可犯的光輝。旁側是釘在十字架上的基督，從手心和足心被釘處流出的鮮血已經凝結了，緊鎖的雙眉，使人恍如身受着他的苦痛一樣，從而感覺到他的偉大。宗教藝術的高超，也許是做成了它底不可抗拒神秘性的重要原因之一吧？作為一個無神論者的我，也不得不在此而低頭，作深邃的沉思了。</p>
<p>陽光從鑲着黃色，藍色，或綠色的玻瑪的圓窻外爬進來，掛在乳白色的牆上，遂成了萬千條瑞氣，一室於是便光明美麗了。深黃色的犬鬥是常開的、雖則門鎖中永遠放着匙，是準備誰在厭倦於人生的時候來此懺悔默禱而在臉龐上掛上兩條冰冷的淚痕的罷。來吧：站在門外的人呵！聖瑪利亞會愛撫你，饒恕你的過錯的。閃耀着銀　，穿了黑袍的人將如是說。</p>
<p>還是往門外流覽一回景緻吧。江山如畫陽光艷麗，正是冬日裏一個難得的天氣，枕椅在階前的石攔杆畔，狹長的孤島全貌於是瞭然了，那是因為教堂是建築在小山的頂上的原故呀，輪船從海外歸來，當半島的輪廊隱約可辨的時候，最先觸着眼簾的，往往就是這座金黃色尖頂的建築物了。好一個海上的燈塔呵，而那居住在教堂內的主教和司鐸們，不會也和燈合守一樣的感覺到寂寞吧？一條龐大的黑狗，搖着尾巴走來了，我逗引它，便親蜜地低了頭，伏在我底膝蓋上，是這麽馴良的生物呵，也大概嘗到孤獨的悲哀，而渴望着誰的相伴吧？</p>
<p>下面是無涯的海和孩子玩具似的，堆砌着的建築物。已經是冬天了，而樹葉還綠得這樣嬌翠，海是平靜的，波浪柔和地向岸邊靠來，自己不覺已在　圖中了。依着往昔的脾性常常是會情不自禁地引吭高歌的，正如有人說過：「絕頂登高，誰不想悲慨的一長嘯呢」？且殊不自量地竟有小大下之意了。然而現今是什麽時候，這兒是什麽地方呵！你竟如此樂意忘形，是早就忘記了那充滿了原野底芬芳，牧歌底恬淡情緒的鄉土了嗎？你且看東望洋的盡頭接連在山脚那邊，延綿不絕的大地，咫尺之差，生活着的人，不是和這邊就恍如在兩個世界了嗎？是了，是了。我錯了！謝謝你的指示，使我還不至向迷津走去。唉，我怎能忘記那熟識透了的田園阡陌呢？</p>
<p>鄰近多的是荒蕪的，原始的島嶼。看來除了裝飾着單純的海之外　，眞是一無甩處了，可是自己站立着的地方，從而不也一樣是山石崢嶸，荊棘載道的所在嗎？，經過百年就已經具備了現代都市的規模了，何况現今還成了遺留着一命的我們的苟活處呢？不禁感佩着人力的偉大。太空是廣闊而靜穆的。迷漠地望着流逝的雲彩，我倒泛起了思潮的波浪。待到教堂尖頂的電鐘猛然敲了六下的時候，一艘從香港來的輪船徐遲的駛淮港內，黃昏已偷偷站在面前了。</p>
<h3 id="c81">日本女人的命運 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 飛馬</p>
<p>我們都能曉得日本女人是挺多情的，她們服待丈夫是挺週到的，但是，因為日本這個　本主義社會的體質裏，還包含着濃重的封建氣味，所以日本女人的多情，我們可以這樣說：正是日本女人的致命的悲慘。</p>
<p>美國好萊塢的電影公司，曾經抓到日本女人的多情，而拍攝過一新哀艷的影片，叫做『蝴蝶夫人』的，看過那張影片的人，到於為本女人是感到一種怎樣的憧憬呵，這倒並不是想有那麼一個女人來體貼服待，而是感到人間如果眞有那樣的女人的愛，而男子們如果不像那個美國水手去玩一下女人的話，那真是一個甜美的世界了！</p>
<p>可是這究竟是一種理想，正因為日本女人是過分的多情，所以日本女人是更加悲哀的。自抗戰以來，在報章上，每當我們看到日本女人寫信給她們的在中國從事侵略戰的文夫的時候，不問我們是怎樣一個偏激的愛國主義者，總是感到日本的女人是多麽的悲慘！</p>
<p>『一，二八』的時候，日本人曾經組織過『索夫團』這次的『八，一三』，因為限於日本國內新聞封鎖的嚴厲，我們雖然沒有看見過什麽關於日本的女人的消息，然而我們能够想像得出，比『索夫團』更為牡烈的事實是一定在日本表演得很多的。不久之前，在上海，有兩個日本兵自縊身死，為的是他們的妻子在上海當了妓女來『安慰』在華作戰的軍士！</p>
<p>日本女人的運　，是悲　到了這般地步。然而還有更慘悲的哩，如日昨報上載有東京的電訊一則：說是，日政府近以在華將士死亡極多，留在國內之寡婦人數逐愈趨愈衆，卹金問題，成為國家經濟重大負祖之一，現為减輕此項重担計，乃擬派寡婦三萬人，授以四個月之殖民訓練，送往南美巴西，因巴西境內有日僑二十萬人，而未婚者衆，大可以收容此批寡婦。並聞日本拓殖省，尚擬派遣大批寡婦前往「滿洲國」，日前在國會之預算席上，曾提出每年經費十七萬元之要求，以供移殖寡婦之用云。</p>
<p>我抄了以上一段新聞，並不是對寡婦再醮有以非雞，或則反對，而只是感到：這樣的移殖寡婦，只是加重了日本女人的悲慘運命，這是誰都可以想像得到的！為什麼？因為這柿移殖是含有侵略的意味！</p>
<p>然則日本女人的運命怎樣可以改善呢？當然是要日本女人自己去考慮了，然而中國抗戰最後勝利獲得之日。也就是日本女人脫離那種悲慘的「移殖」運命的一日！</p>

<h3 id="c83">雙鳳奇緣 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>「雙鳳奇緣」是以昭君和番為題材的小說。關於王昭君的文藝實在太多了。即以胡丹鳳所編的「靑塚志」而論，詠王昭君的詩就有四百多首。變文方面有「明妃傳」。戲劇方面也有元雜劇四種：馬致遠的「漢宮秋」，關漢卿的一哭昭君」，張時起的「昭君出塞」，以及吳昌齡的「夜月走昭君」。可惜除了「漢宮秋」以外，已經全失了。明淸傳奇則有「和戎記」和「靑塚記」，以及周文泉的「琵琶語」。明淸雜劇則有陳與郊的「昭君出塞」，（收入盛明雜劇初集者實為「昭君出塞」，張弓的「王昭君」誤以爲「和戎記」，見嶺南學報二卷二朋）尤侗的『弔琵琶』和薛旦的「昭君夢」。後二種收人「雜劇新編」，振鐸在前年曾發現「新編」全帙。以上各種戲劇都曾經張壽林的「王昭君故事演變之點點　滴』，（燕京大學文學年報第一期）和黃綮琇的『王昭君故事的演變』，（廣州中山大學民俗週刊第一二一期）列舉過，惟另有最晚出的『雙鳳緣』傳奇似為諸家所未舉，這種傳奇玉霜簃有藏鈔本。劇學月刊上杜頴陶的『記玉霜簃所藏鈔本戲曲』云：『雙鳳緣』一冊，不分卷，朱錄作者姓名，演王昭君事，與坊間通行之『雙鳳奇緣』小說同。原共上下二卷，此本祗存上卷，共二十齣，至李陵抄斬毛延為家屬而止，下卷缺』　大約此劇是『雙鳳奇緣』以後所編成的了，</p>
<p>小說方面似僅『雙鳳奇緣』一種，孫楷第的『中國通俗小說目』失戰，凡八十回，張壽林以為當刊於淸李中葉，有通行本。此書多取「漢宮秋』『和戎記』以及『靑塚記』而略加更改，「如漢宮秋寫昭君目彈瑟琶，為元帝聽見」因此得寵，小說則改為被林皇后聽見，再由林后告訴元帝，多添一層波折，漢宮秋唱句云：「點得這一寸秋波土有瑕。』小說則云。「每張圖畫眼下點了乏麻大一點黑痣」。</p>
<p>和戎記說昭君自己畫像，小說同。和戎記說官人肅善音代昭君川嫁，小說同，惟無宮人名字。和戎記寫昭君死後託夢，要元帝討她的妹妹王秀貞，小說亦同，只是把王秀貞的名字改成賽昭君罷了。</p>
<p>靑塚記現僅存出塞送昭兩齣，最近仙電社朱傳茗和華傳浩還表演過好幾次，舞姿甚好，此劇有御弟王龍送昭君，小說也因襲了這種說法，祗是把王龍改成劉文，（與小上墳主角同名）罷了。</p>
<p>如此說來，雙鳳奇緣這部小說可以說是集傳說的大成了。</p>

<p>— 麗天</p>
<p>太陽早已下了山，大地已為夜之神所支配。他們兩人為着急圖離開這沈悶的危險地帶，不得不在為黑的長夜裏摸索着，前淮了。山路的崎嶇，河涌的泥濘，前面有沒有×人，背後有沒有土匪，他們一些也沒有空去計較過，祗有加速地　進。</p>
<p>估計跑了這多麽的途程、約英是三更時分了。他們到了一處地方，前面是一條很高的士堤，阻截他們的去路。從沒有月色而祗有些微星的、黑裏，模糊中可以見得到的，這條堤，不特是有二三丈的高，且左右兩端的長度，似乎是無止境的。</p>
<p>『咦！前面　約是一條戰壕吧？我們要小心地上去！』他警告着傳令兵。</p>
<p>堤的傾斜，大約是六十度角，他們經了幾番隨仆隨起的艱苦，終於爬上了這土的上堤面，可是脚指尖起了步，便觸兩條平行的鐵軌，耳朶邊，隨着一陣陣的東南風，送來了遠方的呻吟聲，李長人伸一伸他的長腰，毛髮有點悚然，出乎意外地，在他們小心地正在走着，前面一丈多遠的路旁，錯綜地擺着三個僵硬了許久的屍體，地面上拋着兩枝七九步槍，他們毫無猶豫地拿起了這兩枝槍，依然向前邁進着。</p>
<p>前面是一座火車站，依稀地可以認識了。走到了那站名的石牌下面，因為光綫的暗淡，無從兒到那牌上的文字：幸虧他具有身長的優異，他用力地將他的脚跟站高，拚命地將他的臂膀舉高。同時運用他的手指的觸覺，結果得到『吉山站』三個字。</p>
<p>『呀，吉山啊，那裏距離不還的×村有戚家呢。』在微弱的星光下，在那傳令兵的眼光中，見得到李胤的面孔，浮起一些慰安。他們爲辨別×村所在的方向，終於　着遠方的犬吠聲探索地進行；但他們因為增加了背脊上槍枝的重量，速率未免較前滅低了。</p>
<p>進了村，到了他的親戚家裏，換上了土人的服裝，吃完了一頓安樂飯，他們得到暫時休息的時候，東方快要吐白了。</p>
<p>太陽從窗外射進來，他一離床，卜卜的槍聲，從村外傳入，鄉民們神色倉皇地嚷着：『×人來了！』接着便扶老携幼的朝着村邊後路亂竄去，李長人混在人潮裏離開這個村落，到了對河這邊山崗的樹底下，正在那兒休息的時候，那個傳令兵老早不知去向。在他驚魂未定的當兒，回頭一瞧×村速綿的屋頂一溜溜白的黑的火烟胃冲着，不一會那面整個的天空。染上了紅色了！</p>
<p>當他亦着脚渡過了一條三丈多寬的小河後，後面趕來丁一隊吵着怪刺耳的聲昔的　馬，李胤知道無可避免了，迫得　裝　着他的背脊，混在逃難的村民裏加速地向前走。</p>
<p>『呀！喂……』他們急促的脚步兒，被緊迫在後面的×兵喝住了。</p>
<p>在被迫回轉頭來，面孔又靑又白，他們頭抬看到了大隊的馬背上正拿着來福槍的×兵，口裏不知嚷着什麽話，兩隻手忙亂的指着前，又忽然指着後，李長人和難民們祗有呆着口瞪着他們。</p>
<p>大概×兵了解他們彼此言語的隔膜吧；當中有兩個從馬背上跳下來，忙着在他的衣袋裏，拿出了日記薄和鉛筆寫着：</p>
<p>『此處有支那軍嗎？』</p>
<p>李長人審察他們的熊度，似乎不是在他自己的身上來作惡，且他們的神情都帶些相當驚惶的成分；李長人眉頭一　，心裏打算淸楚，要實行嘗試他的空城計。</p>
<p>『有』，他壯着胆從×兵手裏奪過筆來，答覆他們。</p>
<p>『有多少？』</p>
<p>『很多』，李長人再進一步去試探他。</p>
<p>果然，這兩個×兵到見這樣的答話後，馬上增加了他們恐慌的程度，嚷着；</p>
<p>『多？多！狠多？多……』</p>
<p>隨在後面的×兵們，被他兩人緊張的表情所吸引，陸續地從馬背上跳下來，五六隻手不約而同地指着李畏人的「很多」這兩個字，大家整個臉孔，蓋上一副驚惶而疑惑的神氣，異口同聲的反問着：</p>
<p>『多？很多？多……』</p>
<p>李長人的心，由恐懼而變為稱心的得意了。他推斷他的計策經已得售，他已把握着主動的地位了。但他一轉念間，為免被×兵們的糾纏計，便計劃他的第二步的脫身計，他再寫着：</p>
<p>『這是昨天的』</p>
<p>『呵！昨天！』×兵們像釋了重負地大家在歡呼着。</p>
<p>『現在到了什麽地方？』一個說得有五六分像的中國話的×兵。搶着問。</p>
<p>『向那邊』李長人胡亂地向左一指說。</p>
<p>「呀……」他們在滿意的心情中雜亂的狂呌着，各自騎上他們的馬背，向李長人的右手邊飛跑了去。</p>
<p>×兵的馬蹄，在前面泥塵裏，漸漸消失了。站在李長人的背後，嚇到面如土色的這些逃難的鄉民們，吐了一口氣之後，一面看不起×兵的胆怯，一面在佩服李長人的機智。</p>
<p>在他孤零的旅途中，瘋狂般的飄流裏，有一天，終於到了的部隊，在未奉命開拔時的原駐地——番禺縣××村——他忽忙地跑進村裏平時最為繁盛的街市，可是現在終　不到半個人。祗有大街小巷裏許許多多的餓貓和野狗正在狂叫着，歡迎這遠地飄零的人為來。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">European War Clouds and Soviet-Japanese Conflict <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>These past few days, the international situation has been extremely urgent. The three most sensational events that have shocked the world are: first, the war clouds in Europe are thickening again; second, the Soviet-Japanese conflict is intensifying; and third, Japan's threats and blackmail against Britain, France, and the United States. Except for the third event, which has been repeatedly commented on by this newspaper and does not require further elaboration, we would like to briefly express our views on the first and second events to our compatriots from all walks of life and friendly countries.</p>
<p>First, regarding the war clouds in Europe, since the Munich Conference, although some blind and stubborn commentators have praised the "xxx compromise policy" for its contribution to world peace, we not only cannot agree with this view, but have also earnestly pointed out that the fascist aggressors are greedy and insatiable. Any compromise or concession policy will not only fail to achieve peace and stability, but will inevitably encourage the arrogance of the "xxx people" and increase the risk of a world war. Recently, the British and French governments recognized the Spanish rebel regime, and we must point out its assistance to the fascist aggressors and the harm it causes to world justice and peace. We must point out that the fascist invasion of Britain, the United States, and France to redivide the world has developed to a more serious stage. The current development of events is generally as expected. Today's newspapers quoted a Reuters dispatch from London as saying: "While various circles in Europe still largely maintain an optimistic attitude towards the European situation, there is reliable news confirming the movement of Italian troops near Italy, Libya, and Djibouti, as well as the secret dispatch of mysterious troops within Germany, which seems to coincide with Hodson's previous speech in Olympia, which is quite shocking." Another report stated: "France and Italy are both actively preparing their border defenses in Tunisia and Libya. French journalist Baudinet stated in a speech at the Anglo-French Association that Britain and France must cooperate in the Red Sea to prevent the outbreak of war in Europe, as Italy is now preparing to launch a war in Africa. If it arbitrarily achieves a partial victory in the Red Sea region, Britain and France will inevitably be forced to declare war. Regarding Germany's intentions, rumors abound. According to general observations, it is widely believed that Germany seems to be using the demand for its old colonies as an exchange condition to prevent war, but Germany is currently mobilizing its troops on a large scale, which has caused great anxiety among various governments." The two major fascist aggressors, Germany and Italy, are already preparing to launch even more shocking and dangerous actions under the compromise policies of Britain and France to provoke war, threaten democratic and peaceful countries, and redivide the world. This is an undisguised secret.</p>
<p>Second, the Soviet-Japanese conflict is not news in itself, but at a time when Western aggressors are intensifying the crisis of a major war, it is more noteworthy that Japanese aggressors are vigorously launching provocations against the Soviet Union. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 4th, "Well-informed sources mostly believe that the Soviet-Japanese fishing agreement dispute is more likely to cause war than the European situation, and Japan's dispatch of a military delegation to visit the Axis powers seems to be directly related to this danger." The dispatch also stated, "If Germany's attitude towards the anti-German movement in Poland is so peaceful, then the Libyan and Tunisian border issues and the Soviet Russian Far East fishing ground disputes must be given more attention." This shows the international attitude towards the Soviet-Japanese conflict. According to a Reuters dispatch from Changchun on the 4th, "This morning, Soviet and puppet troops again engaged in battle on the border north of Manzhouli. It is reported that the situation on the Soviet and puppet border is more tense than before." We should have at least the following basic understandings of this event: first, Japan not only does not have the strength to attack the Soviet Union and win today, but also does not have the determination to launch a real anti-Soviet war, as can be proven by its surrender to the Soviet Union in the Zhanggufeng Incident. Second, today's Soviet-Japanese disputes are entirely based on the Japanese rulers' strengthening of their collusion with Germany and Italy, threatening and enticing the democratic powers in order to achieve their ambition of dominating the Pacific. Third, Japan has recently been constantly using the Soviet-Japanese dispute to conceal its defeats in the invasion of China and to alleviate anti-war sentiment at home and in the military. Fortunately, the Soviet authorities have constantly and ruthlessly exposed the conspiracies of the Japanese aggressors. After the Zhanggufeng Incident, they have repeatedly struck back at the provocations of the Japanese and puppet troops. Now, the entire Soviet Union is united in preparing to repel any aggressor's attack, and its national defense strength and international prestige are also increasing day by day. Therefore, the result of Japan's provocations against the Soviet Union will not be the Soviet Union that is threatened and harmed, but the Japanese aggressors themselves!</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is the war clouds in Europe or the Soviet-Japanese conflict, we can draw the following conclusions by analyzing their basic causes and development status: (1) Under the continued implementation of the British and French compromise policies, international fascist aggressors will become even more rampant, and the Second World War, in which they invade Britain, the United States, and France to redivide the colonies, has reached a more serious stage; (2) The Eastern aggressor, Japan, has already taken advantage of this new situation, using a bluffing anti-Soviet war to support Italy and Germany's dangerous actions in Europe and Africa, while also vying for the interests of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands in the Pacific; (3) In this new and serious stage, democratic and peaceful countries, especially Britain and France, have reached a crossroads. A small number of rulers representing financial capitalists are still continuing to lead the country to the path of danger through compromise policies, while the broad masses are launching a struggle against compromise and against fascism under the leadership of revolutionary parties and progressive people; (4) The prestige of the Soviet Union's peace policy has greatly increased internationally, especially after the Zhanggufeng Incident and the recent repeated expressions of opposition to fascist aggression and support for democratic and peaceful forces. Even Poland, which has always been close to Germany, has recognized this point and changed its attitude, and the British government, under the lessons of this fact and the calls of the domestic masses, has had to reconsider the adjustment of British-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, we can more clearly understand the path of struggle to save the current crisis: first, we understand the nature of today's world war, which is a war in which fascist aggressors attack democratic and peaceful countries to redivide the world. The main targets of attack are colonies and semi-colonies, and the countries that own all rights and interests in colonies and semi-colonies, such as Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, whether in Europe, Africa, or the Pacific, the democratic and peaceful countries of Britain, the United States, and France should quickly unite further. Second, the new world war launched by fascism will harm colonies, semi-colonies, and all small and weak nations, and will sacrifice the oppressed masses of the world. Therefore, all small and weak nations and the oppressed masses should unite to establish a united front to resist fascism and resist aggressive war; third, the governments and people of China and Spain have resolutely expressed their continued struggle with the fascist aggressors for national liberation and the maintenance of world peace and democracy. The governments and people of all democratic and peaceful countries, all oppressed nations, and the working masses should unite to effectively support China and Spain in continuing the war of resistance; fourth, the new major war crisis being promoted by fascism is clearly contrary to the Soviet Union's peace policy and policy of national independence and liberation, and at the same time, it is contrary to the interests of the Soviet Union and the working masses of the world. Therefore, the Soviet Union has been and is more actively leading the struggle of the united front against fascism and against aggression. This struggle should obviously and must receive the warm support of all democratic and peaceful countries and all people who love justice and freedom. The new dangerous plans of the fascist aggressors have already begun in the Far East and will soon begin in Europe. All democratic and peaceful countries, all small and weak nations, and all oppressed masses, all proletarian and working masses, should unite under the banner of anti-fascism and anti-aggression, and fight for eternal justice and freedom!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Overseas Chinese in Annam <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Yun</p>
<p>The Scenery of Annam and the Overseas Chinese. When Annam is mentioned, people will think of the story of the victory in the Battle of Lang Son, followed by seeking peace and ceding territory. However, it is hard to imagine that today, this place of national historical shame has become the artery of international transportation for the long-term war of resistance. From Haiphong through Dong Dang to Longzhou, and from Haiphong through Hanoi to Hekou, are shortcuts to the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi. Therefore, the warring country at that time was not Italy or Germany, but France, which can be considered a stroke of luck in misfortune.</p>
<p>The first impression of Annam that makes people feel good is their municipal administration, especially Hanoi. The straight asphalt roads, the straight green trees on both sides, the straight rows of streetlights in the middle, and the pedestrian paths on the left and right, which are about half the width of the roads, plus the interspersed green lawns and the light gray and light yellow Western-style buildings, truly make you feel like you are in a garden, without feeling the noise of the city. If you walk out of Bulevard Road at dusk, stroll around Sword Lake, listen quietly to the scarlet music flying over from the opposite lake, and look at the rainbow-shaped red palace-style cafe under the lights and clouds, with a gentle breeze carrying bursts of ancient temple bells, you are guaranteed to have the feeling of being in Zhongnanhai or Summer Palace's Kunming Lake in Beijing. This kind of leisurely and tranquil scene does not have a strong coppery smell, nor does it have a completely Western color, but rather contains the life attitude of Chinese style, a harmonious beauty of artificial and natural.</p>
<p>In Annam, the second impression is the Annamese people. In my impression, the Annamese are inseparable from betel nuts. In Lang Son, Dong Dang, and Haiphong, many Annamese people have a row of black teeth, chewing betel nuts non-stop, spitting out mouthfuls of blood. Women all open their chests and tie cloth belts, while men wear half-length black long shirts. ×××××××××× Once you get to Hanoi, the situation is very different. Annamese men in leather shoes and suits, and Annamese women in silk clothes and white pants, have an elegant look that is no less than that of modern Chinese ladies. The physique of the Annamese is not strong, and women are especially weak and overwhelmed. Plus their charming dress, with a bunch of soft hair draped behind their heads, wearing tight gauze on the upper body and white silk pants on the lower body, with a pair of open-toed slippers tied on their feet, walking along, suddenly, completely conforms to the demeanor of ladies in ancient Chinese paintings. No wonder Chinese people come here to cheer loudly and voluntarily assimilate with the Annamese.</p>
<p>In Annam, the third impression is the overseas Chinese. When we enter Annam, we don't understand the language or the roads, so we can travel freely everywhere entirely thanks to the guidance of the overseas Chinese. On the road, when we see shops with the signs of "Guang" or "Fu," they are shops opened by Cantonese or Fujianese people. Based on this principle, buying things and asking for directions is foolproof. In Hanoi, the Railway Station Street, Guangdong Street, and Fujian Street are the commercial centers of the overseas Chinese. In Haiphong, Chinatown and Tokyo Street are also gathering places for overseas compatriots. When overseas compatriots meet, they don't ask about the weather or the market, but mostly about the news of the war of resistance. Their concern for national affairs is evident.</p>
<p>Among the overseas Chinese in Annam, Cantonese people are the most numerous, followed by Fujianese, and then Guangxi and Zhejiang people. All the businesses and public institutions of the overseas Chinese are in the hands of the Cantonese. In Hanoi, Haiphong, and Nam Dinh, only the Cantonese and Fujianese gangs can cooperate harmoniously and jointly promote public welfare. In the Saigon area, there are separate gangs just for the Cantonese, such as the Guangfu, Siyi, Chaozhou, Dongguan Nanlu, and Hakka, and the spirit of cooperation is far inferior to that of Hanoi and Haiphong. The gang leader system has a long history. The gang leader serves a term of two or three years. The qualifications for gang leader must be that of a local overseas Chinese who is wealthy, enthusiastic about public welfare, generous in donations among the overseas Chinese, and has both virtue and seniority. In some places, the gang leader is elected by the overseas Chinese and then recognized by the local government. In some places, the government predetermines several gang leaders and then hands them over to the overseas Chinese for election. The latter situation is extremely rare. The only task of the gang leader is to collect taxes for the French government. The personal tax of the overseas Chinese (16.5 yuan per year) and the business license tax of each shop are collected by the gang leader and handed over to the Vietnamese authorities. The right to elect and be elected as gang leader by overseas Chinese is limited to shops that have a business license. Each shop has only one vote. The election takes place at the city hall. In previous years, there have been no incidents of bribery or uproar in the elections. The person who becomes a gang leader can be exempted from their own business license tax and the personal tax of all family members. In addition, the Vietnamese government also provides a salary of about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per year, which is drawn from the tax revenue of the overseas Chinese. However, those who become gang leaders are all wealthy households who are not interested in money, so the salary is mostly donated to public welfare undertakings, or to support schools or hospitals, or to donate to guild charities. The overseas Chinese value face the most, and being a gang leader is the most prestigious, so wealthy people are willing to resign after serving one term as gang leader. To be a gang leader, one must be able to spend money and manage the affairs of the neighborhood. A good gang leader is often the one who donates the most money and is the most willing to do good. Mr. Huang Lizhou, the former Cantonese gang leader in Haiphong, and Mr. Luo Weiji, the current gang leader, are both patriotic figures and have good relationships. It is said that in Saigon, there are too many separate gangs, and some clear-headed people have realized the disadvantages of the overseas Chinese dividing into gangs and are carrying out a gang merger movement, but it is hindered by the French and Vietnamese authorities, who believe that this traditional habit does not need to be changed to avoid complications. In the eyes of the rulers, the more divided the organization of overseas Chinese, the better. This "unity" request is something they greatly disapprove of.</p>
<p>In Hanoi, there are about one or two hundred Fujianese overseas Chinese who, because they have lived in Annam for generations, their wives and relatives are all Annamese people. Their children also wear Annamese clothes. They do not admit that they are Fujianese, but form their own organization called the Mengxiang Association, which is between the Fujianese and the Annamese to show the difference. The license and personal taxes they pay are based on the Annamese method, which is more than half less than what the overseas Chinese pay each year. Their children attend Annamese schools, and their families and living habits cannot find any Chinese style. However, the Fujian Guild Hall in Hanoi was originally initiated and built by them. To this day, their relationship with the Guild Hall is only to come to burn incense and worship on major holidays. This kind of forgetfulness of one's roots is worthy of our concern. Fortunately, only a very small number of people do this. Overseas Chinese... it can be said that they are everywhere, and yet they are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Intermarriage between overseas Chinese and Annamese is not very popular, probably more common among Fujianese. Cantonese people must return to their homeland once when they grow up, get married, and then come out again. The personal tax for women, children, the elderly, and the weak here is extremely low, only a little over one yuan per year, so it is not a burden on the family. Overseas compatriots do not value Annamese people very much, which is probably due to traditional reasons. However, in fact, ××××××××××××××, they urinate everywhere, spit betel nut juice all over the ground, are fond of eating and lazy, and are weak and afraid of things, as if they were born to be ruled. Once, when I visited the Hanoi Exposition, I saw a pair of gold-lettered couplets in the main hall. The first line said,</p>
<p>"Even if there is accomplishment, why bother climbing high mountains and looking at the distant sea?" The second line said,</p>
<p>"If the government has nothing to do, why not drink wine and get close to women?" The sound of national demise is vividly written on paper. ×××× Fooling the people policy can be regarded as reaching its peak.</p>
<p>The recreational life of the overseas Chinese in Annam..., the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Haiphong has a Party Department reading room, with only a few Datang newspapers. The newspapers they read are always news from four or five days ago. Saigon has a Chinese newspaper, but its management is not improving. Some overseas Chinese in Haiphong have recently planned to run a newspaper, but because the import of machinery and tariffs are too high, it has not yet materialized. The organization of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce is currently under preparation. It is said that it will be established soon. This is also a major event worthy of reporting for the overseas Chinese in Annam!</p>
<h3 id="e3">A Memorial Meeting of Blood and Tears <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— (Special Dispatch from Dijiang) Lin Heng</p>
<p>"Comrades," Mr. Chen, who was also the most moved, began to speak in a firm tone. "Look, one side of the sun is covered by dark clouds. This symbolizes the death of the Japanese invaders is coming soon. The other side symbolizes that China has a bright future. Victory in the war of resistance is right in front of us. Comrades, laugh! Laugh!" Mr. Chen made a gesture of appeal with his hand, and he himself gave a wry smile. Some people followed him and cried, but the sound was very small. But some people seemed not to have heard Mr. Chen's words and were still silent. Mr. He's line of sight was focused on the fortress opposite him for a long time without moving. Mr. Ma lowered his head. Mr. Tan did not know when he started to focus his sight into his steel helmet. Comrades Liang, Wang, and Yan were still crying non-stop, secretly wiping their hot tears with white handkerchiefs. Comrade Liang looked at the handkerchief after wiping away her tears and suddenly hid it in frustration, as if saying in her heart, "I want to keep this tear stain as a souvenir."</p>
<p>"To commemorate 'January 28,' we must examine the current world situation, the situation in China, the situation in Dongjiang, and the serious crises that exist now. Does our own organization have any crises? What are the shortcomings...? We should bravely admit our weaknesses and overcome them... To commemorate 'January 28,' our task is to persist in a protracted war and set up guerrilla bases in Dongjiang... To commemorate 'January 28,' I hope that all comrades will work hard to overcome their own weaknesses... To commemorate 'January 28,' I call on comrades to have a general review meeting tomorrow, thoroughly reviewing the past work and style, and use the general review meeting to commemorate today's memorial meeting."</p>
<p>"Support!" A group of young people shouted this slogan in unison.</p>
<p>4.  On the Way Home</p>
<p>"Blood! Blood! Blood taught everything! Never forget today's memorial meeting of blood and tears! Use the general review meeting to commemorate today's memorial service! To commemorate 'January 28,' we must swear to avenge the warriors and fight for national liberation..."</p>
<p>"Arise, you who refuse to be slaves..." After shouting the slogans and singing the March of the Volunteers, this group of young people walked down Feie Ridge step by step. The singing was worse than usual. After singing weakly, there was another silence. After a long time, Mr. Gao told everyone, "Honestly, I have never been so moved in my life as I am today!" Then many people nodded in agreement. Then Mr. Han said, "We must convey this memorial meeting of blood and tears to the General Headquarters, to all comrades, to all compatriots, and to the people of the world! We must write it into a newsletter so that all readers will cry as sadly and indignantly as we do..."</p>
<p>Still few people spoke, completely different from the situation when they set out. With a sad and indignant mood, they slowly stepped into the Kangxian Huiyang County team headquarters.</p>
<p>In Huizhou City, three days after "January 28."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Instructions at the National Education Conference <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Our first National Education Conference was convened in May of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the second National Education Conference was convened in April of the 19th year of the Republic of China. This is the third National Education Conference, more than eight years since the previous conference. The conference is being held at a time when our entire nation is actively engaged in the War of Resistance and nation-building, so its mission is particularly important. The task of this education conference is, of course, to review the current situation in the education sector, study methods of improvement or remedy, and resolve various difficult problems currently facing education. But what I ask of all of you present is that you further confirm the needs of the Republic of China at this time, grasp the central issues in education, and take on the responsibility of saving and building the nation with full enthusiasm and sincerity. That is to say, we must recognize a definite goal in education, and take the Three Principles of the People, which saves the nation through revolution, as the highest standard of our nation's education, implement the outline of the War of Resistance and nation-building, and create a new life for the modern nation. I often say, "The vitality of a modern nation is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings, and it can also be said that education is the general hub connecting the economy and military force. Therefore, we must take developing the economy and strengthening the military force as the direction of our education." Especially during this period of the War of Resistance and nation-building, we must develop the economy to enrich the national strength during the war and lay the foundation for nation-building after the war, and we must also strengthen the military force in order to win victories on the one hand and build the nation and the people on the other. We must create a modern nation with vitality and a promising future for our China from the midst of various hardships and difficulties during the war.</p>
<p>Currently, the most hotly debated issue in education is the issue of wartime education and normal education. That is to say, should we break down all formal education systems, or maintain the normal education system while incorporating methods for extraordinary times? Regarding this issue, my personal opinion is that the solution is very simple. I have often said in the past few years, "In peacetime, we must treat it as wartime, and in wartime, we must treat it as peacetime." I also said, "Wartime life is modern life. In the present era, whether individuals or society, if they do not practice wartime life, they cannot exist and will be eliminated and destroyed." If we understand this meaning, we do not need to have the debate between normal education and wartime education. It is because we could not treat peacetime as wartime in the past that many people cannot treat wartime as peacetime now. These two mistakes are inherently related. We can never say that all education can be isolated from the world, outside of the needs of the nation, close its doors, and ignore the external environment, even when foreign enemies are pressing in. We can still maintain the status quo and not become tense at all. But we also cannot say that because it is wartime, all academic systems, courses, and education laws can be put aside. Because it is wartime, we unconditionally drive all young people in school out of classrooms, laboratories, and research rooms, send them to another situation, and do emergency work without choice or purpose. We need soldiers, and when necessary, we may even have to mobilize professors or university students. We need various cadres for the War of Resistance, and we cannot but organize training for various emergency talents outside the usual education system. But at the same time, we also need profound technical talents in all fields and various types, and we need scholars with specialized research. Moreover, especially during the War of Resistance, we need to focus on expanding various basic educations. In order to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance and conform to the wartime environment, we should use the methods of extraordinary times to achieve the original purpose of education, and use an extraordinary spirit to expand the effect of education. This is what we should do. For example, our schools at all levels should strive for frugality in equipment, simplicity in living, and hard work during the war. We see that the ancients taught their sons by drawing in the ashes, using such simple</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 5 PM, 5th] Jingmen Telegram: In Central Hubei, the enemy is now using three mixed brigades to launch a full-scale offensive against our Jingshan-Zhongxiang road. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented since the second phase of the War of Resistance. We are engaging them in full force east of the Xiang River. The enemy is using aircraft, artillery, and poison gas in a combined assault on Sunqiao and Guanqiao. We are also fighting desperately with all our might. After nine days and nights of bloody battle, our total casualties have reached five to six thousand, a one-to-one ratio, setting a new record since the War of Resistance. The enemy has suffered repeated heavy blows but continues to increase their forces, intending to eliminate our army on the Xiang River. We are continuing our efforts, fighting to the death in a bloody battle.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 5 PM, 5th] Jingdou Telegram: The situation on the highway east of the Xiang River is still stable. The enemy suddenly increased forces and detoured near Dongqiao and Jiukou, engaging in fierce fighting. One of our units advanced eastward from a certain location, and reinforcements were added in a certain area nearby. A certain famous general of ours is now commanding in a certain area in the front, and strictly ordered all units not to cross the river to the west without authorization. The morale is high, with each soldier capable of fighting like a hundred. It is expected that the great victory of the Battle of Linyi will reappear today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yichang, 5th] The enemy who invaded western Hubei along the west side of the Xiang River was ambushed by us yesterday near Jiukou, suffering heavy casualties. However, due to the enemy's use of poison gas, many of our officers and soldiers were poisoned, and we were forced to shift our positions. Jiukou then fell into enemy hands. Subsequently, after our army reinforced and counterattacked, we successfully recaptured it that evening.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 4th] (Delayed) Jingdou Telegram: The enemy forces invading Central Hubei along the Hanyi Road have increased to 7,000, with more than ten artillery pieces and more than ten tanks.

Part of the force then detoured from Xia Yanggang and Hejiaji, via Fujiatai, launching a fierce attack, attempting to expand the war and break our main force, not hesitating to use aircraft and artillery to bombard us heavily, and advancing dangerously. An unprecedented bloody battle for control has unfolded in the past two days. Our positions were repeatedly in danger, but our officers and soldiers resisted desperately, falling one after another, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and finally turned the situation around. As of the 4th, they were still fighting fiercely. The enemy's casualties were double ours. Their wounded were all transported from Wamiaoji to Zaoshi. A certain company of a certain regiment of our left wing attacked the enemy's command post in Yiheji, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers and capturing many light machine guns, rifles, and military supplies.

In addition, there are more than ten enemy military warehouses scattered throughout the area. Also, there are still five to six hundred enemy soldiers in Taolin. The enemy at Xitang has built a military bridge at Yougang. The enemy situation in Matang, Yueyang, and other locations remains unchanged.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 4th] Yesterday, there were no changes on the front line.

<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 5th] Before dawn on the 2nd, one of our units destroyed about two li of the Datong-Puzhou Railway at Dacun, north of Anyi. They removed many telegraph wires and railroad spikes and buried landmines nearby. When a column of enemy guard troops passed by, they triggered the landmines, killing more than ten people.

<h3 id="e10">National Education Conference: Speech by Chairman Chiang <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from page 2)</p>
<p>Even with simple teaching tools, outstanding individuals can be cultivated, just as diligent study can be pursued even in poverty. This is what our teachers and students in wartime should emulate. Regarding student training, the expansion of subjects, the reduction of unnecessary courses in social education, and the maximum utilization of school resources and personnel, these problems can be solved by generalization and cannot be exhaustively enumerated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we must not forget to treat wartime as peacetime, and we must not forget the fundamentals for the sake of expediency. This war is not only about fighting for national survival but also about transforming our people and revitalizing our country during this period. Therefore, our educational focus should not only be on wartime but also on the post-war era. We must estimate what level our national knowledge and abilities should be raised to if our country is to become a modern nation. If we want to build our country into a modern nation, we need tens of thousands of specialists, hundreds of thousands or even millions of technicians and engineers in various sectors, and even more millions of teachers and cadres to train the people. These must all be provided by our education community, and these problems must all be solved by our education community. I do not have time to discuss all the specific details of education. I hope you will focus on the most fundamental point, which is to strengthen our national will to resist the war and establish our spirit of nation-building, and especially to constantly improve our inherent national morality. Everyone knows that our country, with all its material deficiencies, is in such a dangerous and difficult period and still has to shoulder such extremely heavy responsibilities. If we do not overcome material difficulties with spirit, we will not be able to achieve victory in the War of Resistance. If we do not utilize our inherent morality and revolutionary spirit, and if we do not generate strength and create material wealth from this spirit, we will not be able to achieve success in nation-building. Moreover, what the Japanese are now trying by all means is to attack our spirit, overwhelm our spirit, and eliminate our nation's inherent morality and revolutionary spirit, so that our national life has no foundation. Therefore, the most urgent need at present is to revitalize and concentrate our spirit. Recently, the Central Government proposed and the National Political Council decided to implement a general mobilization of spirit, with the aim of strengthening our national spirit to shoulder the historical mission of resisting the war and building the nation. Methods will be determined soon and promoted nationwide. We hope that all educators across the country will resolutely take on this important responsibility and lead by example to advocate for all sectors and universally implement it. As the ancients said, "To transform the people and create customs must be done through education." Every word and deed of educators will affect the social atmosphere. No revolutionary movement in recent decades has not been enthusiastically advocated by the education community and ultimately brought to fruition. Today, it is not just a question of reviving and reforming, but a question of survival or extinction. We must promote the inherent spiritual morality of our nation, arouse the independence and self-esteem of all our people, awaken the entire nation to the determination to sacrifice against the Japanese invaders who are invading and destroying us, and establish a deep sense of self-confidence in the revolutionary future and the nation's future. Then, we can encourage the determination to move forward, make progress, and struggle actively. Only then will this vast and ancient nation be able to give birth to a bright and brilliant new life from thousands of hardships. I believe that for our country today, the lives of all educators should no longer be the leisurely life of teaching behind closed doors. Educators should not simply follow the curriculum, transmit knowledge, and treat it as a personal livelihood or private profession. Today's educators should see themselves as frontline warriors who break through enemy lines, as social mentors who change customs, as pioneers who blaze new trails, and as sages and heroes who continue what is broken and preserve what is lost.</p>
<p>Today, we can no longer agree with the long-misunderstood slogan of educational independence, which makes educators an isolated group who only adhere to national laws and the responsibilities given to them by the state. I believe that when we talk about education today, we should integrate education with military affairs, politics, society, economics, and all other undertakings. How can we integrate education with military affairs? We must create in all students a sense of national defense, self-defense, and the ability to govern themselves and the country. Students who are not of age should be able to serve the country's military when they grow up. Students of age should be able to enlist in the army when the country needs them. When not conscripted, each person should have a skill that can be used for war-related work. How can we say that education is integrated with politics? The Book of Rites says, "To be a teacher is to be a leader." In ancient times, teachers were the source of political cadres at all levels. Today, our educators should also take on the responsibility of training and organizing the people. How can we say that education is integrated with society? Recently, I have often heard that school educators regard running social education as a burden. I believe that while the budget, time, and energy must be considered appropriately, fundamentally speaking, school education cannot be separated from society. The ancients said, "Learn from each other to make up for shortcomings." We cannot bear to ignore the suffering of our fellow countrymen in society. In order to achieve the purpose of education, and to prevent being influenced by bad elements, we should also develop the general knowledge of the people in society to improve the school environment. How can we say that education is integrated with economics? This is even more a key point in our nation-building plan. We must teach the people according to the needs of national economic construction, emphasizing labor, productivity, and especially encouraging the ability to create. All educational plans must be coordinated with economic plans, so that our educational function can become a factor in creating the vitality of a modern nation.</p>

<p>Also Sends Telegram to Comfort Soldiers at the Front</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 5th] The Chengdu Cultural Community held a conference to promote the building of the army and sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to pay respects. At the same time, they also sent a telegram to comfort the soldiers at the front. The texts of the two telegrams are as follows: (1) To Chairman Chiang: Resisting the war and building the nation are arduous tasks. Actively building the army is the ultimate plan to defeat the enemy. Your Excellency leads the entire nation and is dedicated to this great cause. We respectfully lead sixty thousand citizens to vigorously carry out the army building movement to assist Your Excellency in achieving final victory. We respectfully send this telegram for your consideration. The Chengdu Army Building Propaganda Conference respectfully bows. (2) To the Military Commission and Soldiers at the Front: Resisting aggression and building the army are essential to defeating the enemy. National rejuvenation depends on this one battle. You are shouldering the heavy responsibility, sacrificing your lives on the battlefield, enduring hardships and toiling tirelessly. We respectfully join all the citizens in vigorously carrying out army building propaganda, vowing to be your backing to win a decisive victory. We specially send this telegram of comfort and respectfully request your attention.</p>
<p>Also Sends Telegram to Comfort Soldiers at the Front; Propaganda Week Begins Yesterday</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 5th] On the 5th, over ten thousand citizens of Chengdu were mobilized to participate in the opening ceremony of the Army Building Movement Propaganda Week. At 1 PM, the Shaocheng Park was packed with people, and amidst the enthusiastic atmosphere of the masses, they participated in the Army Building Song Festival. At 4 PM, the opening ceremony was held. Huang Jimu, the chairman of the conference, reported on the significance of the Army Building Movement, stating that China is resisting the war to resist aggression and uphold world peace, and that building the army is the way to achieve this goal. Therefore, the beginning of the Army Building Movement is the beginning of China's victory and the dawn of world peace. Deng Wenyi and Islamic leader Dr. Yao Le and others then gave speeches. At the end, the following proposals were passed: (1) Recommend that the Central Government issue a general order to all provinces and cities to expand army building propaganda; (2) Recommend that the Central Government issue a general order to all provinces and cities to organize army building propaganda teams to go to various places to publicize to the masses and comfort the new recruits; (3) Recommend that the Central Government issue a general order to all provinces and cities to expand the fundraising campaign to raise special funds to comfort the new recruits; (4) Recommend that the Central Government issue a general order to the whole country to launch all sectors of the people to expand and carry out preferential treatment for the families of discharged soldiers; (5) Send telegrams of comfort to the soldiers at the front. Then, they shouted slogans. Then, tens of thousands of lanterns were lit and the entire team set off to hold a lantern parade. The more than thirty thousand lanterns of various styles mostly contained the meaning of building the army and saving the country. The lantern procession carried joy and traveled for several miles. The sound continued until midnight.</p>

The giant Eurasian Airlines No. 19 plane arrived at 9:50 AM in the morning, speeding from the southwest corner of the airport in the brilliant sunshine. The Ambassador disembarked first, and the welcoming personnel immediately stepped forward to shake hands and express their greetings. The Ambassador returned the greetings one by one, and after a brief exchange of pleasantries, boarded a car to rest at the French Embassy on Lianglukou. It is reported that the date for the French Ambassador to present his credentials must wait until he meets with our Foreign Minister Wang to personally deliver a copy of the credentials and the list of accompanying personnel. Then, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a letter to the Military Affairs Office of the National Government to submit it to Chairman Lin for approval, which can then be determined. The Ambassador will go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 6th to pay his first visit after arriving in Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Kunming Office, 4th] The French Ambassador, Cosme, flew to Yunnan at 2:30 PM on the 4th. The provincial government sent personnel to warmly welcome him. Cosme told reporters that he was very pleased to revisit China. He will fly to Chongqing tomorrow. His future actions will be determined after presenting his credentials.

<p>Anti-Traitor Elements Are Quite Active; The Puppet Government's Gang of Cronies Is Extremely Panicked</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, Sichuan, News] Beiping External News: The Japanese constabulary and Chinese police are continuing to conduct strict searches in city markets, theaters, brothels, streets, and city gates. The Chinese side said that the main reason for the authorities' intensified precautions was to prevent a "terrorist element" hiding in Tianjin from coming to Beiping to carry out activities. It is known that two uninvited guests went to the residence of a certain Chinese editor of the Butoku Shinbun, a mouthpiece of the Japanese military, on a certain day. The editor happened to be out, and the people told his family that they were from Tianjin and would threaten the editor's life. It is also rumored that someone attempted to assassinate a senior official of the "Provisional Government" here two days ago. It is also said that eight terrorists went to the "Provisional Government" office late at night and fired at the guards before fleeing. Although these three incidents have not yet been verified, all parties said that they did happen.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The period from the July 7th Incident to the fall of Yuezhou was the first phase of the War of Resistance, and the period after that is the second phase. In the first phase, the Japanese army's conspiracy to force us into submission without a fight and to quickly resolve the war was broken by us. Now, in the second phase, the military has turned to mountainous areas far from transportation lines. The Japanese army has lost its geographical advantage, while we have gained it. Furthermore, with various chaotic situations within the Japanese army, the Japanese army is in a dilemma. In order to try to save the decline, the Japanese army put forward the so-called outrageous slogan of establishing a new order in East Asia, attempting to quickly make peace and let us be their puppets forever. In order to expose the Japanese army's conspiracy, we have organized the first propaganda week of the second phase of the War of Resistance from March 6th to 12th, based on the main points of the President's rebuttal of the ridiculous statement and the opening speech of the Fifth Plenary Session. The methods are as follows: (1) Propaganda meetings will be held in all parts of the country during the propaganda week; (2) Special broadcast speeches will be held; (3) Special issues will be published in various newspapers and periodicals; (4) Propaganda teams will be organized in various places to distribute propaganda in the countryside; (5) Lecture meetings will be held in various schools; (6) Special propaganda will be held in various cinemas, theaters, and entertainment venues. In addition, a large number of propaganda materials have been prepared to be sent to the battlefields for distribution. In addition, the Central Broadcasting Station has invited ministers and officials of various departments to give broadcast speeches during the propaganda week. It is reported that those who have been scheduled include President Kong of the Executive Yuan, President Dai of the Examination Yuan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister Chai of the Central Propaganda Department, Minister Chen of the Political Department, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, and Minister He of the Ministry of Military Administration.</p>
<h3 id="e17">In a Restaurant Commemorating Lost Territories <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Alone in Changde, strolling the streets, I unexpectedly ran into old friends Liu Chongren and Jinwu Erjun, whom I hadn't seen in ten years, along with a new acquaintance, Mr. Xu. We were all as delighted as if we had shot down an enemy plane out of nowhere. We decided to go to the "Jing Su Cuisine Restaurant" for lunch to enjoy a long-overdue reunion. Unexpectedly, as we were about to attack the cold appetizers, a siren wailed loudly. Other customers rushed downstairs, and we had no choice but to follow their lead, hurrying down to grab a boat to cross the river (many small boats were moored along the Yuan River bank for people to escape). However, those who couldn't row themselves were left drifting in the middle of the river, exposed targets for machine-gun fire. We drank the west wind in the graves for half an hour on the opposite bank before returning to eat the cold dishes newly seasoned with – bomb-shaken dust. This was like a warning: "Don't forget the national crisis while eating!"</p>
<p>The Jing Su Cuisine Restaurant has clean windows and attentive service, a unique style among inland restaurants. It's said that the restaurant was recently opened by a group of capable Suzhou refugees, based on the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength." In their organization, the upper-class refugees with legal tender in their pockets naturally became shareholders and bosses; the middle-class refugees, who were either close relatives of the upper class, sociable women, or skilled cooks, took on roles as accountants, buyers, receptionists, and chefs; and the rest, lacking the qualifications of the upper two classes, were generally demoted to delivering dishes, washing dishes, and doing odd jobs. Initially, I thought: since they – the people are from Suzhou, speak Suzhou dialect, and the cuisine is purely Suzhou style with dishes like "Ten Tragic Scenes" and "Lion's Head" – why not simply rename the restaurant "Suzhou Cuisine Restaurant"? Wouldn't that be even more popular? But they didn't change it that way, and later I realized that Jesus had his own reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking of the restaurant's waitresses, some might imagine they are seductive and mysterious women like their fellow townsman Lin Daiyu or their professional peer Zhuo Wenjun. In fact, they have no mystery at all, nor do they deliberately act coy or seductive. They serve you dishes briskly and chat with you seriously. And sometimes, when they are chatting happily with you, she will suddenly raise her eyebrows, clap her hands together as if they were half-opened ivory fans with a loud "bang," as if she has caught the most hateful thing in the world and wants to grind it to dust in her palms, rubbing them vigorously for a few moments before quickly separating her hands with a slight sigh. Friend, if you are not a fairy from the moon, but a citizen of the Republic of China, you will immediately realize that she is a modern woman with the same family and national hatred as you.</p>
<p>On that day, I asked one of the waitresses, who had such a standard demeanor, in a counter-attacking manner: "Geli dou yi jiao guan hao, a xiang hui Suzhou qu?" (The scenery here is very good, do you want to go back to Suzhou?) This sentence of "classically awkward" Suzhou dialect actually received the desired effect:</p>
<p>"Wei fu xiang hui qu!" (Why wouldn't I want to go back!) But she seemed to know that I hadn't received a "Suzhou Language School" diploma, so the second sentence she spoke in fluent Mandarin: "We left our lovely hometown the winter before last! When we set off, we were so scared by the heavy gunfire that we didn't even pack our luggage properly and fled from the countryside. On the way, we learned that the Japanese hadn't yet reached Suzhou; it was Liu XX's troops, who had always had bad discipline, causing trouble. Later, after suffering countless hardships, we fled to Wuhan. After finally catching our breath, the situation became tense again, and we were evacuated here. We fled to three or four provinces, and we pawned and ate everything. If it weren't for my younger brother shining shoes and earning a few cents to survive, we would have been helpless in Hankou long ago... Recalling our lovely hometown—Suzhou, where there are our beautiful mountains and rivers, our fields and ancestral graves, our relatives and friends, especially my old grandmother, my mother and sister who were lost on the way; drifting in a foreign land, whenever we encounter difficulties, we really wish we could immediately grow wings and fly back to Suzhou, find my loving mother, and cry to her to my heart's content in her arms, even if it means dying!</p>
<p>"However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized it wasn't right;" Her tone suddenly changed from mournful to passionate. Her eyebrows were also raised at this moment: "Our hometown is still under the rule of the Japanese and traitors. The Japanese have killed tens of thousands of our male compatriots in our occupied areas. Are these male compatriots not human? They have raped countless of our sisters. Are they supposed to be supplies for the Japanese army to ravage? If we go back now, aren't we jumping into a fire pit with our eyes open, and giving ourselves to the Japanese to be slaughtered and humiliated in vain? Wouldn't that kind of miserable situation of being slaughtered and humiliated be thousands of times more painful than fleeing?</p>
<p>"So, since we're here, let's stay. Before we drive the Japanese away, even if we wander for a lifetime and die in poverty, we will never dream of returning home to be obedient citizens; unless we go back as female guerrillas. Also, the reason our restaurant is called Jing Su Cuisine Restaurant is not just because of the special dishes of Jing and Su, but to remind the customers who come here to eat sooner or later: If we are fellow villagers, we should not be happy and forget 'Su'; even if they are compatriots from other provinces, they should not easily forget the lost territories..."</p>
<p>Her conversation, woven almost entirely with blood and tears, expressed the tenderness of a daughter in its sorrow and the heroic spirit of a knight in its tragedy, both of which could win the sympathy and indignation of the listener. She and her group of sisters, in this earth-shattering wave of resistance against Japan, will surely produce a character like the heroine of Zola's book "Nana," a singer of similar background and worth. I wanted to ask a few more – at least questions about the real situation of the refugees, and chat with them patiently. However, I was afraid that my three friends would misunderstand, thinking that I was not there to treat them, but to interview women from Suzhou. So, I had to turn the conversation back to the three of them.</p>
<p>The heroic victory in Taierzhuang, the fierce battle for the Dabie Mountains to defend Wuhan, all three of them participated in these events, and two of them even bore glorious wounds. They talked about how fierce these major battles were, how brave our army was. They described everything so vividly, it felt as if we were there. It was truly inspiring and exhilarating. On the contrary, we frankly admitted that during the first phase of the war of resistance, our weapons were slightly inferior to the Japanese, which sometimes led to the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers on the front lines. But hearing this did not discourage us. It only deepened our respect for the spirit of sacrifice of the soldiers!</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Xu said with great sorrow: The XX army came from a certain border province, and most of its soldiers were simple, honest, and brave. They usually believed in the doctrine of spiritual victory over material, and when they fought, they would rush forward with courage. Of course, this often led to great victories, but it also resulted in tragic deaths and sacrifices. The reason why this army was able to make outstanding contributions and win praise at home and abroad in the Taierzhuang battle was due to this.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu was a junior officer in that army. On the second day after the army was urgently deployed to the Taierzhuang front line at night, in the faint morning light, amid unfamiliar scenery, Mr. Xu vaguely saw several turtle-shaped objects arranged in the grass in front of him, but he couldn't tell what they were. Fortunately, there was a squad leader named Wang under Mr. Xu's command who had traveled to many places and had a broader knowledge, so he went over and asked him:</p>
<p>"Squad Leader Wang! What are those strange things?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. Those are Shandong tombstones."</p>
<p>But less than three minutes later, those "Shandong tombstones" began to crawl and move, and under the cover of several tongues of fire spitting out "ge ge ge" sounds, they rushed towards our direction!</p>
<p>"Damn it, these strange things are probably tanks, right? I don't believe they can swallow people!" Squad Leader Wang bravely jumped out of the trench and used hand grenades to welcome those things that were really tanks. The other brothers caught sight of Japanese soldiers following closely behind the tanks and rushed forward like hibernating dragons emerging from the earth, tigers descending from the mountains, and immediately launched the first fierce melee combat between the strong men of that province and foreign soldiers!</p>
<p>The result of this fierce melee was a great victory, but it also led to a pitiful joke, namely, Squad Leader Wang's mistake of recognizing tanks as Shandong tombstones while trying to look smart and knowledgeable. However, this example of risking life and limb against steel and iron not only did not affect the glory of the victory in Taierzhuang but also made the results of the first phase of the war of resistance even more heroic. In short, this was an inevitable phenomenon in the first phase of the war of resistance. In the current second phase of the war of resistance, not to mention the battlefield between the north and south, we have mechanized units, chemical units for passive anti-gas warfare, and the new and sharp air force actively adopting offensive tactics, all showing a spirit of progress and innovation, successively producing unprecedented wonders, and about to bear the beautiful fruits of a new worldview!</p>

<h3 id="e18">U.S. President's Speech Condemns Dictatorial Regimes, Resolves to Defend Freedom of Religion, and Requests Congress to Allocate Funds to Strengthen National Defense <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt, in a speech commemorating the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Congress today, solemnly declared the benefits enjoyed by the American people under a democratic system and compared them with those enjoyed by people under dictatorial rule. He stated, "Some people outside believe that our system is outdated and will restore a system of personal rule. However, the system of personal rule has been proven to be autocratic and incompetent for two thousand years. The United States will not encourage them to believe in this system. Our representative democracy is very different from the dictatorships of recent years." President Roosevelt stated that there are two major differences between these two systems: the principle of democratic politics is that "everyone can freely choose policies and that there is a bill of rights to protect American democracy." He also stated that American trials implement a jury system, while trials in some countries follow methods from the dark ages. He wondered if Americans have compared the two.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt submitted a report to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives today, stating that the United States cannot encourage countries with tyrannical regimes. Before Roosevelt's speech, Pittman and Chief Justice Hughes also delivered speeches. Chief Justice Hughes was the first person in American history to deliver a speech in Congress. In his speech, he praised the protections granted to the people by the Constitution and warned the people not to be emotional or influenced by prejudices, lest they endanger the fundamental interests of democratic countries. In his speech, Roosevelt stated that there are two types of systems in the world today: democracy and dictatorship. The former is based on human rights stipulated in the Constitution, while the latter is based on personal intentions. Freedom of religious belief is a universal right of mankind. Where democratic systems cannot prevail, the freedom of the people's belief is also completely deprived. Should we ignore this phenomenon and promote the arrogance of rejecting religion? The United States will never do this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] President Roosevelt's speech in Congress yesterday has once again aroused the anger of Germany. Semi-official commentators stated that President Roosevelt's words were completely fictitious, especially Roosevelt's claim of religious persecution, which was even more absurd, and they also expressed great dissatisfaction with Roosevelt's proposal for freedom of publication.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The U.S. President has requested Congress to allocate more than 122.3 million yuan to strengthen national defense, including more than 55 million yuan to strengthen the army's strength, 44 million yuan to build coastal defense works, more than 760,000 yuan to increase the air force's strength on various islands, 730,000 yuan to train 20,000 civilian pilots, and the rest to be allocated to nautical surveying expenses. At the same time, he requested Congress to increase the number of naval personnel by more than 110,000. It is said that the most serious issue in increasing naval personnel is the construction of warships. According to official estimates, the number of Yu army officers can increase from 448 to more than 10,000, and the number of Marine Corps officers can increase from 73 to more than 1,400.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Bankhead, requesting the immediate passage of an additional army budget of $122,383,237 (note: the House of Representatives has already passed the funding required for the army portion of the national defense expansion plan, $499,857,936). Its uses are as follows: (1) Purchase various necessary military equipment, such as anti-aircraft guns, tanks, defensive artillery, cannons, gas masks, etc.; (2) Train 20,000 civilian aviation pilots; (3) Supplement the defense of the Panama Canal, requiring a total of $1,416,373. At the same time, President Roosevelt also stated that he would later request Congress to approve funding for the construction of roads in the Panama Canal area.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] General Noguès, Governor-General of French Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of the garrison in French Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in North Africa, recently returned home to report on his duties. He left for the French port of Tunis in Africa tonight, heading to the fortress area in southern Tunisia to inspect defenses. Then, he will return to Paris via Morocco to present a report to the Mediterranean Affairs Committee on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] Chief of the Army General Staff General Badoglio recently inspected defenses in Libya in North Africa, focusing especially on the defensive works at the border between Libya and French Tunisia. He has now returned to the capital and immediately met with Prime Minister Mussolini to present a report.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] The French-Italian dispute, which had been put on hold because of the Pope, has now "resurrected" with the election of the new Pope. Political figures here believe that Cardinal Pacelli's election is very promising. The new Pope enjoys a high international standing, has a broad vision, and is familiar with international diplomatic issues. Although the Pope will not come forward to mediate the French-Italian dispute, it is hoped that he will indirectly find a way to resolve the French-Italian problem through diplomatic channels, as everyone still remembers that the new Pope's first speech was that he would take promoting international peace as his duty.</p>

<h3 id="e30">European Diplomatic Activities: Cooperation Between Romania and Poland; Germany's Demands Cause Unease in Italy <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] While current European diplomatic activities appear calm on the surface, their content is far from simple. Diplomatic sources believe Mussolini is waiting for the complete end of the Spanish Civil War before making his demands on France. Although no one dares to predict the specific content of these demands, it is generally believed that Mussolini may focus on political rights rather than territorial claims. The current focus of diplomatic activity seems to be in Warsaw and Beijing. Reports from Rome state that Italian journalist Gaida, after accompanying Ciano on his visit to Poland and returning to Italy, announced that Poland would soon form a joint front with Germany and Italy, proposing colonial demands. Gaida suggested that countries with large colonies should cede some of them to countries with large populations and strong development capabilities, replacing complete occupation with free trade. However, some uncultivated land in the world should be fully occupied by populous countries. Gaida concluded that Germany, Italy, and Poland are countries with cultivation labor, while Britain and France are not. According to news from Warsaw, the Polish government has decided to establish a colonial affairs department, specializing in domestic and international propaganda related to Polish colonies. The department will hire experts with knowledge of African languages and agricultural science to train "colonial pioneer personnel." After Ciano left Poland, Polish Foreign Minister Beck has been in intensive consultations with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, who recently led a delegation to Poland. According to the Warsaw correspondent of the Times, the main issues discussed by the two foreign ministers were two: one was the attitude of both countries towards the Soviet Union, and the other was the discussion of Hitler's eastward expansion. The discussion of these two issues will begin with consideration of the existing Polish-Romanian military alliance. However, King Carol of Romania refused to help Poland establish a common border between Poland and Hungary after the Munich Conference, so relations between Poland and Romania have recently cooled. The correspondent also said that it is generally believed that King Carol of Romania has now expressed deep regret for this move, realizing that Germany's expansion of power through Ruthenia is a more serious threat. The Romanian Foreign Minister, entrusted with important responsibilities by his government, explained Romania's views on this issue and promoted Polish-Romanian cooperation, establishing a common barrier to prevent German or Soviet invasion. It is reported that the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will also negotiate to improve relations with the Soviet Union. According to indirect messages received from Bucharest, Romania is paying close attention to this negotiation, and the results may completely change the attitude of Eastern and Southeastern European countries, adopting a policy of breaking away from German influence. It is said that Germany's economic demands in the Danube region have caused indirect unease in Italy. Observers believe that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's warm welcome to Ciano and the anti-German demonstrations in various parts of Poland occurred simultaneously for this reason. According to unconfirmed reports, the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will discuss the Danube River issue. In addition to providing Polish goods with special convenience for transportation to the Black Sea and Danube ports, Romania will also grant Poland a free zone in Gdynia when the "Polish Corridor" has difficulties to compensate for Danzig and Gdynia. Polish Foreign Minister Beck is also attempting to improve relations between Hungary and Romania.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 5th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here this morning. Foreign Minister Beck hosted a banquet for him in the evening and delivered a speech, saying that Poland and Romania are rich in vitality, which is deeply believed by people. Although there are various changes in the international situation, our attitude is extremely calm and not pessimistic at all. Foreign Minister Gafencu replied that the determination of both countries to cooperate is an important factor. Other countries, regardless of size or distance, should consider this factor if they are working for European peace and culture, and it can be used as external assistance.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Local newspapers say that the recall of U.S. Ambassador to Spain, Bowers (who returned to the U.S. yesterday from France on the Queen Mary), is a preliminary step towards the U.S. recognizing the Spanish rebel government. However, this statement has not been confirmed. It is claimed that the ambassador's return to the country is for government consultation, as with other ambassadors in recent months. If the Spanish government surrenders unconditionally, then the U.S. recognizing the Spanish rebel government is inevitable. However, Washington heard that the Spanish government forces will continue to resist. Local newspapers have listed countries that have not yet recognized General Franco, including all British dominions except Australia. General sentiment here does not encourage immediate recognition of the Franco government.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, San Sebastian, 5th] According to the announcement here this morning, the military and technical plans of various departments regarding the reception of Madrid and various parts of the Spanish Republican Army have been prepared. Even if there is no resistance in the future, it must still be handled according to the steps of the military plan. It is reported that troops will be sent to garrison various villages and towns first, and relief groups will arrive later to distribute food and treat patients. At the same time, administrative organs will be established to maintain order.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, San Sebastian, 5th] According to news, a senior military officer of the Spanish government will arrive in France to discuss the treatment of refugees in concentration camps in France and the issue of sending them back to the country. It is reported that the Spanish government has held talks with the French ambassador to discuss the resumption of postal and railway transportation between the two countries.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 5th] According to news, the Spanish Franco government's tax revenue in 1938 increased by 400 million pesetas compared to previous years. General opinion believes that this is because the Franco government's economy is progressing. All taxes, except those promulgated in 1936, have no new additions or surcharges. Even during this wartime period, the increase in tax revenue is a good sign, and it is firmly believed that other economic advancements can be realized after Spain restores peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Burgos, 5th] General Franco has blockaded the various seaports of the Republican government and is bombing towns and cities of the government forces on the east coast. The Nationalist army has concentrated a large army of 200,000 people, preparing to launch a surprise attack to the south. Once there is a sign of demoralization in the government forces, the attack will begin immediately.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Cologne, 4th] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson delivered a speech at a banquet celebrating the establishment of the Anglo-German Association tonight, answering the concerns of Berliners. What Berliners are concerned about is: "What guarantee is there that your country's military buildup is not intended to attack Germany?" Henderson said that Chamberlain has stated in the House of Commons that Britain's military equipment is only used for self-defense. Foreign Secretary Halifax has also stated in the House of Lords that no politician in Britain wants to wage a war of aggression. Even if there is one, he cannot gain the support of the people. However, when Britain's independence and important interests are endangered, people of all parties will resolutely resist for the sake of self-defense.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e36">An International Situation of Mixed Surprise and Joy <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Spring has arrived; horses are fat, and people are healthy. It is the season for battle. The international news of the past few days has already begun to use the most sensational words of battle: "tension," "serious," "critical"! This news tells us how the fascist aggressors are more crazily expanding the crisis of world war, which is shocking. This news also tells us the awakening and preparations for resistance of democratic and peaceful countries, which is exciting. In addition to the comments in today's editorial, we feel that we should also list the recent facts of the active strengthening of the peace front.</p>
<p>First, the United States' attitude of supporting democratic countries with strength is more obvious. As a result of the Senate debate on national defense issues on March 3, the isolationists Johnson and Nye have failed, and most senators support Roosevelt's guiding foreign policy. At the same time, during the large-scale US naval exercises, the State Department is also conducting research with the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and Belgium on the issue of exchanging wartime raw materials.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to actively expanding its military and strengthening its defenses in the Far East, Britain has recently considered improving its relations with the Soviet Union. Although this cannot ignore the true face of the British rulers, Britain will be the main force in promoting Anglo-Soviet cooperation for its own interests and the demands of its people. At the same time, the approach of Britain and the Soviet Union will at least provide better conditions for Sino-Soviet cooperation.</p>
<p>Third, under the unanimous demand of the people, the French government has begun to increase its military strength in North Africa and the Far East, and has clearly stated that it will never give in on the colonial issue. The strength of the People's Front under the leadership of revolutionary and progressive parties continues to grow, and the voice of restoring Franco-Soviet cooperation begins to rise again.</p>
<p>Fourth, although the more progressive attitude taken by the British and French governments recently is a manifestation of easing the people's opposition movement after recognizing the Spanish rebels, it can also be seen that the strength of the People's Front in Britain and France has developed significantly.</p>
<p>Fifth, the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movements of the Japanese people and in Taiwan and Korea have been successively exposed under heavy guard and suppression, and anti-war and idle war movements have also occurred in the Japanese invading army in China.</p>
<p>In addition, what is particularly important is the oath of Soviet leader Stalin and the entire Red Army to defend the motherland and defend peace, and the development of defense forces and the strengthening of naval and air forces in the Far East, which are a major blow to the aggressors and the leading force for democracy and peace.</p>
<p>These facts increase our confidence in victory and our determination to struggle. We must use redoubled efforts to develop this struggle.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Nursing Staff Association <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to be prepared for danger in times of peace, have recently been actively preparing to cope with the advent of extraordinary times. Now, they are planning to organize a nursing staff association, preparing to participate in hospital nursing during wartime. Dr. Dewey, the host, announced yesterday that he hopes that women from all walks of life in Hong Kong will actively participate.</p>
<p>××××××××××××××××××, what will they think when they see this news? The Hong Kong authorities have to step up their wartime preparations, can it be that we Chinese sons and daughters have forgotten that our motherland and hometown are in the midst of an unprecedented disaster?</p>
<p>There are indeed many women in Hong Kong who have been and are working hard to save the country. Their fighting spirit under double oppression is often more admirable than that of men. However, they still account for only a very small minority of the total number of people. The number of people who are idle and indulge in love, superstition, and even gambling is shockingly large. We at least hope that all educated women will immediately choose a kind of work to learn or serve society and the motherland. We at least hope that women's organizations will take advantage of the eve of the March 8th Women's Day to mobilize the young women who have fallen outside the circle of saving the country, and let them embark on the broad road of fighting for their own liberation and defending themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Spain Under German-Italian Management <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>—Written by Frank Hanighen, Translated by Tan Zinong</p>
<p>Germany and Italy have a consolidated economic position in Spain, and they will certainly not want to withdraw. In the future, Spain will be a supply base for raw materials and a development area for commerce for Germany and Italy. Their superior position is like that of the East India Company in the 18th century and the Cecil Rhodes Company in the 19th century.</p>
<p>After Franco's victory, the economic potential of Germany and Italy will certainly increase, and democratic countries such as Britain and France will definitely be beyond their reach!</p>
<p>This expansion of Fascist economic power had already begun long before the Spanish Civil War. In 1934, Italian banking groups and German industrialists sent an engineer and a mining expert to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain—translator) to investigate the geology. Sure enough, they left and returned by sedan chair, and they found rich mineral deposits, especially tungsten, carbon, and other major military raw materials. That was just when Franco was rebelling in Morocco.</p>
<p>Germany saw the rich resources and wanted to get involved. This may be a major reason why Germany helped Franco's rebellion. After Franco occupied the entire territory of Morocco, he controlled the entire mining industry of Morocco, and a German company, Hismalowo, managed the export affairs. Franco needed a large amount of military supplies to seize power, so he transported a large amount of pig iron to Hamburg as an exchange for purchasing military supplies from Germany. Before the war, the average monthly output of pig iron there was 70,000 tons, but under the control of Hismalowo, it has increased to 130,000 tons.</p>
<p>After Franco's army, with the assistance of German and Italian aircraft, advanced to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, the copper mines in the towns fell into the hands of Germany and Italy again. Before the war, Italy and Spain controlled the world's mercury market, and Almaden in Spain was the place with the richest mercury production. It is not surprising that Italy wants to occupy Almaden.</p>
<p>In 1937, Franco repeatedly advanced towards Bilbao in an attempt to seize the iron ore there; needless to say, this was also instructed by Germany and Italy. Therefore, Hitler said in a speech in Hustburg at that time, "I hope that after Franco's victory, he will seize the iron ore there."</p>
<p>However, this conflicted with Britain. Most of the iron used in British industry is imported from Spain, accounting for more than one-third. In Bilbao, several British mining companies are shareholders of the largest mining company in northern Spain, Aloguna La. Therefore, after Franco occupied Bilbao, the British government immediately sent a "commercial envoy" to negotiate with the Franco government to maintain Britain's interests in Bilbao, so that the iron there could continue to be transported to Britain. Sure enough, it was successful. The establishment of the "Non-Intervention Committee" was originally to play such a trick!</p>
<p>However, we have to say, does Franco really not benefit Germany? Needless to say, of course not. In December 1937 alone, 35,000 tons of pig iron were transported to Germany in the port of Basque. Therefore, the rumor that Germany and Britain shared the iron ore in Bilbao is not necessarily unfounded.</p>
<p>In addition, Germany has also established factories in Franco's occupied areas. For example, in Andaloosa, the textile center, there is Andaloosa Company established with German capital. A rayon factory and several tobacco companies established in the German section of Morocco are also German capital. Hamburg Shipping Company has also set up a branch in Spain. Germany is also planning Spain's transportation and aviation network, and many air routes have been completed and can be used.</p>
<p>While Germany's economic power is constantly expanding to Spain, Italy is also following suit, joining in the fun. In Milan, I saw Italian merchants smiling happily, making war profits from Spain. Italy's imports of Spanish pig iron increased from 33,000 tons in 1936 to 180,000 tons (1937); iron sheet imports increased from 327,000 tons to 500,000 tons; magnesium increased from 23,000 tons to 75,000 tons. Italian officials said that in 1937, they obtained 22,000 tons of pyrite from Spain.</p>
<p>In Milan, I saw many architects and engineers receiving construction business in Spain after the war. It is said that Italian magnets, rayon, rubber, and other goods are also being transported to Spain for sale in large quantities. Rome has also organized a semi-official financial institution to promote Italian business in Spain. The most important thing is the establishment of the Italian-Spanish Bank, with its headquarters in Rome. This is the driving force behind the expansion of Italian financial power to the Iberian Peninsula!</p>
<p>According to reports from Rome, the Italian government sent people to assist in the formation of the Franco government. Therefore, some people say that Franco's government's domestic and foreign affairs are solely led by Italy. Italy has sent many political spies to Spain. Bo Zhini, the head of the Italian secret police, has personally visited Spain. This is to start from the political aspect to achieve the effect of political and economic aggression.</p>
<p>However, will the expansion of the power of Germany and Italy conflict? There are different opinions on all sides. Some people think that since they are believers in Fascism and partners of the Berlin-Rome axis, they will certainly not conflict. Moreover, not only will they not conflict, but they may also unite to squeeze out the vested interests of democratic countries such as Britain and France in Spain. In Milan and Rome, I was told that British merchants would lend money to Franco as a bargaining chip.</p>
<p>According to the January issue of the "London Financial News," Italy's investment in Spain is 2.5 billion lire, while Germany's is 800 million marks. Some people say that Franco wants to borrow money from Britain and France to repay Germany's and Italy's debts and keep the raw materials for his own use. However, Germany and Italy will definitely oppose it.</p>
<p>After Franco's victory, Germany and Italy hope that Spain's economic system will be like theirs, so that Germany, Italy, and Spain can join hands economically. Will democratic countries such as Britain and France shrink back like this? (Translated from "The New Republic Weekly")</p>

<h3 id="e39">Luohu Bombing Incident Resolved! Hong Kong Government Accepts Japanese Compensation of HK$20,000; Tanaka Visited Hong Kong Again Yesterday for Further Discussions; Opening of the Pearl River is Difficult to Achieve in the Short Term <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 4th) It is confirmed that the Japanese government has paid HK$20,000 to the Hong Kong authorities as compensation for the previous bombing of the Hong Kong border by Japanese planes.</p>
<p>[Local News] Regarding the compensation issue for the losses caused by the wanton bombing of Luohu by Japanese aircraft, the negotiations between the British and Japanese representatives in Hong Kong, and the Japanese side's willingness to compensate only HK$20,000 for the losses in Luohu, has been reported in the newspapers. According to Western news, after the Hong Kong authorities negotiated with the Japanese side, they reported the amount of compensation that the Japanese side was willing to pay to London to wait for a decision. It is reported that the British authorities have accepted Japan's compensation, but on the principle that the Japanese side earnestly guarantees that such incidents will not happen again. As for how to guarantee, nothing has been heard yet. It is found that the Japanese plane invaded Luohu this time and dropped a total of six bombs, killing eight people, most of whom were Chinese. The loss of other tracks and houses is very large. This mere HK$20,000 is not enough to compensate. It is also found that Tanaka, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in South China, who came to Hong Kong to apologize to the British and negotiate compensation, has been in Hong Kong for many days. In addition to negotiating the Weihu issue with the British side, he accompanied Miyasaki Daiping and others again last night to meet with the local military and political authorities for further discussions. Regarding the opening of the Pearl River, according to the reporter's investigation, it is difficult to achieve in the short term. At present, the shipping between Guangdong and Hong Kong is once a week for Japanese merchants and twice a week for British ships.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Preparing for the Arrival of Wartime! Actively Recruiting Nursing Staff; Hong Kong Government Organizing a Nurse Supplementary Service Corps; Seeking Participation of Women from All Walks of Life in Hong Kong for Training <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to be prepared for danger in times of peace, are actively carrying out facilities related to preparing for the arrival of extraordinary times. In addition to air defense matters, which are handled by the Air Defense Commissioner in charge, and are being prepared properly, they are also carrying out the British Civil Service Plan. The recruitment of volunteer workers for firefighting and rescue is also being actively promoted. According to reliable sources, the proposal to establish a hospital nurse supplementary service corps is now being actively implemented, with Dr. Dewey in charge. According to Dr. Dewey, Britain is now conducting a universal recruitment of women to prepare to participate in hospital nursing work during wartime, encouraging them to study nursing techniques. The organization of the Hong Kong Nurse Supplementary Service Corps is to give those who are interested in obtaining this knowledge the best opportunity, and hopes that women from all walks of life will actively participate. It is reported that the implementation method of the plan is to provide essential training for nurses in lectures at the Mary Hospital every Wednesday morning at 10:00 am, starting from the 15th of this month. Participants are requested to submit application forms to Mrs. White of the Department of Health in the post office. The association will establish close contacts with organizations such as the St. John Ambulance Brigade Women's Air Defense League. Each of these associations will send representatives to serve on the association's subcommittees. Those who pass the first aid and nursing training exams can go directly to the hospital for practice. The Mary Hospital and Kowloon Hospital are currently designated as practice locations for students. Those who are not proficient in English will go to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital and Lai Chi Kok Hospital for practice. As there are many women in Hong Kong who have nursing knowledge, the association is eager for these personnel to fully cooperate and serve as trainers or other teaching positions. The association is currently raising funds to recruit these workers.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Demand Exceeds Supply: Major Landlords in Hong Kong and Kowloon Are Building New Apartments; All Units Are Pre-leased Before Completion; Monthly Rents Are More Than Double the Previous Rates <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to exchange rate fluctuations and the need for wartime supplies in various countries, the prices of metals have soared, especially the demand for iron. Taking Hong Kong as an example, its value is several times higher than it was a few years ago. According to general construction experts, although the price of iron is high, Hong Kong has not reduced its imports due to the high price. In recent years, wars have broken out in China, and both the rich and the poor consider Hong Kong a safe haven. The poor, unable to support themselves, have to rely on relief from aid organizations, but they are willing to rent cramped spaces to seek temporary shelter. The rich spare no expense in searching for land to build their own residences, or even pool large sums of money to invest in real estate. Therefore, recently, new buildings have sprung up everywhere on King's Road, near the Causeway Bay Police Station, Wanchai Road, Lockhart Road, Gloucester Road, and in Kowloon City, Sham Shui Po, and Gascoigne Road in Kowloon. However, due to demand exceeding supply, many people seeking housing negotiate rents with landlords in advance before construction is completed, to avoid being preempted by others. However, most of these new buildings have an area of one living room and two bedrooms. In normal times, the rent would be at most fifteen to twenty dollars per month. Today, it would be at least sixty or seventy dollars, but no one objects. Therefore, those who seek profit by hoarding goods are investing heavily in real estate construction, regardless of the high price of iron. The construction experts added that those who are unaware may think that the construction industry is booming this year, and those engaged in it should make big profits. In fact, it is not as good as a few years ago. Previously, the prices of various construction materials were low, so making a profit was easy. Today, apart from iron, the prices of other materials such as wood, copperware, and paint are also affected by rising prices. Many people are engaged in this, competing with each other to bid at low prices, so where is the profit? In short, the only ones who can really make big profits are the major landlords and large property owners.</p>

<p>To prevent the spread of cholera, the Hong Kong health authorities promulgated new regulations last year, stipulating that all milk shops in Hong Kong must sterilize and disinfect the milk they sell before selling it, to limit the spread of the disease. After the promulgation of these new regulations, the original plan was to implement them on January 1st of this year. Due to various reasons, the implementation has been postponed repeatedly. According to reliable information, the authorities have decided to fully implement the milk disinfection regulations from the 1st of next month. After that, all milk sold on the market must be disinfected in accordance with the regulations. Violators will be punished.</p>

<p>A tragic murder occurred on Hamilton Street, Yau Ma Tei, the day before yesterday afternoon. The victim was a coal coolie who was stabbed and sent to the hospital for treatment. The assailant fled without a trace. The injured person eventually died in the hospital at zero o'clock yesterday morning due to his injuries.</p>
<p>Coolie Stabbed</p>
<p>It was found that at 12:20 PM the day before yesterday, a coolie was walking along Hamilton Street in Yau Ma Tei when he was suddenly attacked by several people holding cleavers, iron bars, and sword-like weapons, without any reason. He was stabbed several times and seriously injured on the spot, collapsing in a pool of blood. Nearby residents who witnessed this and recognized the stabbed person immediately informed his mother. Upon hearing that her son was attacked, his mother rushed to the scene to see what happened. Before long, the police siren sounded, and the on-duty police, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene to investigate. The assailants, seeing the situation was not good and fearing arrest, immediately fled. The police then called for an ambulance to take the injured person to the hospital for treatment, while strictly searching for the assailants. However, the assailants had disappeared without a trace and could not be found.</p>
<p>Seriously Injured, One Life Lost</p>
<p>It was also found that the injured person was named Huang Jingxiang (26 years old), his father was Huang Rong, who worked as a coolie, his mother Zhou Huan, who usually worked in Baker Street "peeling garlic", and his younger brother Huang Li (14 years old) lived on the third floor of No. 855 Canton Road, Yau Ma Tei. He usually transported coal as a coolie in the Hamilton Street area and was always safe and sound. Unexpectedly, he suddenly encountered an accident the day before yesterday afternoon. After being admitted to the hospital, although doctors performed surgery, his injuries were extremely serious, and he eventually died in the hospital at zero o'clock yesterday morning due to his injuries. When Huang was dying, he said that he vaguely recognized one of the assailants, a man named Liang, and another named Cai, as triad members. The police are now strictly investigating the assailants. It was also found that the deceased was stabbed a total of four times, once in the chest, once in the back, once in the waist, and once in the left wrist, deep enough to see the bone. According to his family, Huang was always peaceful and never had any quarrels or other incidents with anyone. It can be determined that Huang's sudden accident was a case of mistaken killing.</p>

<p>Kwan Hing-hing, a 20-year-old dancing girl from the Imperial Palace Dance Hall on Des Voeux Road Central, who lived on the second floor of No. 65 Wing Lok Street, was returning home at about 2:00 AM yesterday morning after dancing. When she arrived in front of the dance hall, she suddenly encountered a man named Ah Tong, nicknamed Dirty Tong, who approached her and spoke to her, inviting Kwan to go to Lockhart Road, Wan Chai, saying that a certain Westerner was waiting for her there. Kwan, knowing Tong as an acquaintance and such things often happening, did not suspect him. When they arrived at a certain number on Lockhart Road, Tong led Kwan straight to the rooftop, telling her to wait a moment while he brought the Westerner over. Kwan nodded. After a few moments, Tong returned, and as Kwan was about to ask him about it, Tong suddenly and unexpectedly pushed Kwan down and threatened her, forbidding her from making a sound. He forcibly took her two gold rings and a gold watch that she was wearing and ran down the stairs, fleeing without a trace. Afterwards, Kwan went to the police station to report the case, stating the above, and saying that the lost jewelry was worth about ninety-five dollars, requesting that the case be filed and investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e48">War Affects Internal Transport; Hong Kong Rice Merchants Rarely Profit; Population Increase Leads to a Boom in Small Rice Shops; Hong Kong Government Stores Large Quantities of Grain Sufficient for One Year's Needs <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong's food supply relies on rice from Siam and Annam. The annual import figure is enormous. At the same time, Hong Kong is also the general hub for the export coast of South China. The foreign rice sold to the mainland is all supplied through Hong Kong. Therefore, the annual sales of foreign rice in Hong Kong and its re-export through Hong Kong amount to tens of millions of dollars. Last year, due to the outbreak of war and the blockade of the Pearl River waterway, the import of foreign rice into Guangdong was severely hit. The transport of Annam and Siam rice to Hong Kong plummeted. Taking October of last year as an example, the number of Siam rice shipments to Hong Kong was the lowest on record for the past year, decreasing by more than 80% compared to normal times. In November, it slightly picked up and gradually returned to normal. However, after December, it fell drastically again. Although some merchants searched for and purchased large quantities to transport north during this period, they still could not make up for the losses. On the contrary, the Hong Kong market was quite prosperous due to the increase in the number of people coming to Hong Kong. This situation was unprecedented. However, judging from the business of rice shops last year, few were able to make a substantial profit.</p>
<p>Population Increase, Huge Supply of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>It was found that before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Siam rice had the second largest market share in Hong Kong, according to the export statistics issued by the Siamese Government's Statistics Bureau. Later, due to China's control over the import of foreign rice and the imposition of heavy taxes, it had dropped to eighth place. In the past, many of those who re-exported foreign rice from Hong Kong to mainland China shipped it directly from Annam and Siam. At the same time, the South China Rice Industry Company set up methods in various provinces of South China to regulate grain, using domestic rice to help out where needed. Hong Kong's position was purely as a transit station for the import of foreign rice. Now, due to this impact, the number of rice imports into Hong Kong has inevitably been declining. During this one year and ten months, Guangdong Province, due to disasters, droughts, and poor harvests, repeatedly appealed to the central Ministry of Finance to exempt rice taxes, so as to regulate food and relieve people's difficulties. At that time, all rice merchants in Hong Kong believed that it was a good opportunity for their business. However, each time the Ministry of Finance approved it in the form of registration, the Hong Kong rice merchants were greatly disappointed. Fortunately, the number of people fleeing to Hong Kong increased daily, and the number of residents suddenly increased by hundreds of thousands. The demand for foreign rice was huge, and the rice shop business gradually showed vitality, and it was quite profitable. Although it could not restore the prosperity of the past, it was still barely satisfactory. However, in general, few were able to make a profit.</p>
<p>Adapting to the Environment, Small Rice Shops Increase Greatly</p>
<p>However, the business of general small rice shops was quite good. It was found that in the past year, the lowest rice price was about 13 catties per dollar. To stabilize the people's food supply and meet future needs, the Hong Kong government has continuously stored huge quantities, which has increased the demand for foreign rice and greatly helped the development of the rice industry. It is estimated that the current rice reserves in Hong Kong can supply the residents of Hong Kong for more than one year. On the small rice shop side, before the Lunar New Year, they jointly organized a "distribution house" to directly purchase rice from major rice shops in Annam and Siam for retail. As for the distribution houses, in order to maintain their business and compete with the small rice shops, after several meetings and discussions, they set up distribution points in various districts, a total of 30 in the first six months, distributed throughout Hong Kong and Kowloon, for systematic sales. The business situation was extremely smooth. Therefore, in addition to the 30 distribution points set up by the distribution houses, people in the rice industry also followed suit and set up no less than 20 or 30 distribution points. At present, there are a total of 60 or 70 newly established small rice shops in various districts of Hong Kong, and their business is quite developed.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Salary System for Senior Hong Kong Civil Servants Will Be Improved; Second and Third Grades Will Be Merged into One; Annual Salary Can Also Be Increased for Those Without Promotion Opportunities <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>According to a reliable source cited in the Hong Kong English Sunday newspaper, the part of the Hong Kong government civil servants' salary grade plan concerning senior and accounting personnel is about to be implemented. The new method concerns senior civil servants receiving salaries in pounds, whose salaries will increase annually, from the current 445 pounds to 560 pounds. According to an explanation by a senior civil servant, in short, the main point of this new method is to merge the second and third salary grades into one. Because under the current method, the salaries of civil servants receiving pounds are divided into three grades. The highest amount for the first grade is an annual salary of 700 pounds, the second grade is 560 pounds, and the third grade is 445 pounds. Because there are not many vacancies in the second grade, even if they reach the highest amount in the third grade and have been there for many years, they cannot get a salary increase because they have not been promoted. Therefore, there are many civil servants who are stuck in the third grade. According to the new method, even if they are not promoted, they can continue to increase their salary annually, up to the highest amount in the second grade. Also, according to the new method, the salary method for civil servants selected in England to come to Hong Kong will also be adjusted accordingly. Some of them stipulate that the relevant civil servants can choose the new method or the current method. It is heard that the main point is that the base salary is reduced, and the housing and other allowances are increased. Not long ago, the Western police also made a request similar to the above plan regarding the salary method, abolishing the grade restrictions for lower-ranking police officers, increasing their salaries annually without promotion, and the maximum amount could be increased to the salary of a regular police inspector.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the sudden increase in population in Hong Kong, every inch of land is precious. Not only is this true for residential housing, but ordinary office space is also extremely difficult to rent. Therefore, speculative landlords are mostly rebuilding old houses into high-rise buildings to meet the demand. Recently, the Hong Kong Land Company's property at No. 2 Connaught Road (next to Taikoo Yanghang) was completely demolished and rebuilt into a twelve-story building, which will be used exclusively for office space when completed. The drawings are currently entrusted to Palmer and Turner architects for design. After the drawings are reviewed and approved, demolition will begin.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Japan's Trade with Hong Kong Increases Greatly; Cloth Imports, Tungsten and Silver Exports in Large Quantities; Imports in January Increased by 500,000 Yuan Compared to the Same Month Last Year; Japanese Gray Cloth Intended as Native Cloth Is Also Shipped in a Steady Stream <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>According to the Hong Kong Import and Export Department's import and export statistics for January of this year, both imports and exports of Japanese goods have increased compared to the previous year. The statistics only state that imports and exports of Japanese goods have increased, but do not explain in detail what items have increased. The reporter believes that this matter has attracted much attention in society, so he tried to investigate the situation. The following is a summary report of what has been found in recent days. In January, Japanese goods imported into Hong Kong increased by more than 500,000 yuan compared to last year. In January last year, the imported Japanese goods were only worth 1,267,770 yuan, while this year it increased to 1,751,228 yuan. Nearly all of the increase of 500,000 yuan is Japanese cloth. This Japanese cloth is not high-priced cloth but cloth costing a few yuan. The Japanese cloth that is usually sold by street vendors as Kowloon native cloth is 9 out of 10 from Japan. There are about 20 or so cloth shops in Central that specialize in selling this kind of Japanese native cloth. Late in the Lunar New Year, it was January in the Gregorian calendar. Ordinary families often bought new clothes at this time. They either benefited from the cheaper price of Japanese native cloth, or lacked the ability to distinguish it, and ended up selling Japanese goods in large quantities. Last year, the 20 or so Japanese cloth shops all made profits. As a result, Japanese cloth imports to Hong Kong increased by hundreds of thousands of yuan. Secondly, imports of Japanese raw cloth were also high last month. These raw cloths have no color. Some merchants buy them, add dye to the color, and turn them into "native cloth" again. Exports of goods to Japan also increased last month, from 257,962 yuan to 261,896 yuan. One reason for this increase is that the sales of tungsten to Japan have been increasing daily. Another reason is the increase in the export of silver bracelets to Japan. What is the intention of exporting silver bracelets to Japan? Those who know know. Some merchants specialize in melting silver into silver bars and hammering them into silver bracelets before shipping them to Japan. This is why the export of treasures from Hong Kong also increased greatly last month.</p>

<p>Recently, thieves in Hong Kong and Kowloon have become increasingly rampant. Yesterday, the owner of No. 29 Connaught Road Central, Ho King-lo, was visited by thieves, who stole silver and goods worth 1,500 yuan. He was also robbed of his handbag, with losses amounting to 110 yuan. He reported the case to the police station. Also, a staff member of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Mr. He, had his private car stolen by a thief on Friday of last week. The car was parked in the Pedder Street car park at the time. Also, two car thefts occurred yesterday. First, Mr. Swaff had his Austin car stolen by a thief, license plate number 1692. The car was parked in the Connaught Road Central car park. Second, a Westerner, Mr. Porter, parked his private car in the Chater Road car park at 8:30 PM yesterday. When he returned at 12:00 AM, the car was gone.</p>

<h3 id="e55">"Charity Scoundrels" Make a "National Crisis Fortune" - Kind Benefactors Should Be Careful When Loosening Their Pursestrings! <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>In the early days of the all-out sacred War of Resistance, there were truly countless organizations soliciting donations door-to-door. At that time, overseas Chinese believed that these people were all running around with enthusiasm for the country, so they did not hesitate to donate as much as they could. Cunning people took advantage of this weakness, working hard to run around and appeal during the day, and in the evening, they happily divided up the donations obtained through grand fundraising appeals in rooms booked at hotels. Later, the police authorities, fearing that someone would take advantage of the situation (in fact, there were already quite a few successful villains), began to crack down on this kind of disorganized fundraising method. Because it was not as free as before and added many obstacles, these poorly organized fundraising groups quietly disappeared not long after! And those "people who were working hard to save the country" at this time, except for a few who had already amassed a sum of money, had to find other ways out. Because "fundraising" seemed to be their unique expertise, they had no choice but to continue doing fundraising work. On the other hand, it seemed that fundraising could not do without them, so they turned to more legitimate fundraising organizations!</p>
<p>Those who run these more "legitimate" fundraising organizations seem to be people who are "a bit famous." Although we dare not say that they are scoundrels, their unconscious behavior cannot help but arouse our suspicions. In particular, the fundraisers they recruit are simply too repulsive to us. Not long ago, two fundraising organizations sent people out to solicit donations. It is true that the fundraising goals they advocated were worthy of our sympathy, but what was surprising and unsatisfactory was that every time they came, the faces of the people representing a new organization to solicit donations were familiar to us. Every time, they would fluently state the purpose of the fundraising this time, smiling and encouraging people to contribute a little more. However, their professionalized fundraising methods no longer arouse the sympathy of the general public, but rather deepen their disgust!</p>
<p>The reporter encountered two groups of fundraising staff sent out by a certain organization raising funds for the injured and disaster relief yesterday in different locations. As expected, it was still those familiar faces, sophisticated fundraising methods, and persuasive rhetoric.</p>
<p>I have never been able to figure out whether the "legitimate" fundraising organizations themselves have become professionalized, or whether the professionalized fundraisers have professionalized the fundraising organizations! In short, no matter what, it will not have a good impact on the future of legitimate fundraising.</p>
<p>We cannot bear to see the patriotic people in society have their useful money pocketed by these social vermin, which instead reduces the economic power of the War of Resistance. Therefore, we take this opportunity to frankly and candidly inform the public of these matters, hoping that when compatriots donate money, they should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the fundraising organization is a legal organization.</p>
<p>(2) Whether the person in charge of the organization is reliable.</p>
<p>(3) No matter how much the amount is, it is safest to hand it directly to the bank.</p>
<p>(4) For those who have not solicited donations, pay attention to whether they are people who are professional fundraisers. If so, the request should be refused, because any "organization" represented by these people has not been organized through legal procedures, so they do not hesitate to use false fundraising as a sharp tool.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter solemnly declares to the readers that the motive and purpose of writing this article is only to expose the tricks of the scoundrels, so that the donations made by the public will not end up in the pockets of the scoundrels, but will be used for the sacred purpose of saving the country. I hope that the public will have a more correct and appropriate understanding of the channels for donating money in the future, and I hope that they will be able to work harder to donate money in the future, and do not be discouraged because bad guys and scoundrels are making trouble!</p>

<h3 id="e56">The Offensive is Exhausted; Our Troops on Hainan Island Still Hold the Initiative <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Local Guerrilla Forces Also Rise Up in Activity to Annihilate the Enemy; Wang Yi Leads Soldiers and Civilians in a Vow to Fight to the Death Against the Enemy</p>
<p>[Guangzhou Quick Report] Since the enemy landed on Hainan Island, actively reinforced their forces, and attempted to penetrate deep into our territory, they have met with strong resistance from our local security forces and self-defense corps. The enemy offensive is exhausted, and the battle has gradually reached a stalemate. The following is a record of the war situation on Hainan Island obtained from here:</p>
<p>Enemy Occupies Wenchang, Committing Heinous Massacres</p>
<p>It has been found that the enemy troops from Haikou Qiongshan dispatched infantry and cavalry along the Qiong (Shan) Wen (Chang) Highway a few days ago, advancing and occupying Wenchang County, an important stronghold in the northeast of our Hainan Island. Because the enemy troops encountered heroic resistance from our troops during the attack, they suffered heavy casualties. After entering the city, they carried out extensive burning and looting, inspecting and searching civilian houses and shops in the city in an attempt to eliminate our security forces and guerrilla teams. They subjected the villagers who could not escape in time to insults, harm, and murder. Furthermore, enemy soldiers went out to rape and plunder everywhere. All the grain, food, and property stored by the people of the whole city have been completely looted. According to intelligence, the enemy who attacked Wenchang numbered only five or six hundred. After our troops resisted step by step along the way, especially during the fierce battle with our troops in the suburbs, they suffered a severe blow, with casualties reaching three or four hundred. The enemy troops currently stationed in Wenchang city are thinly staffed and fear being attacked by guerrillas lurking nearby. They have been setting up machine gun positions at strategic points outside the city for several days, dispatching sentries to guard and watch, with extremely strict precautions.</p>
<p>Enemy in Ding'an Under Our Control</p>
<p>Since the enemy occupied Wenchang, they have been eager to eliminate our guerrilla forces lurking in the counties of Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Chengmai, and to coordinate with the enemy troops in Jiaji, Qiongdong. In recent days, they have been searching and advancing towards the surrounding villages. The enemy to the north of Ding'an and Chengmai have also repeatedly invaded southward, attempting to penetrate deep into the central part of our Hainan Island. However, the local villagers, seeing their fields, gardens, houses, and graves trampled and ravaged by the enemy, are filled with national hatred and family grievances, and they have all risen up to kill the enemy, joining the guerrilla organizations one after another. Therefore, the emergence of guerrilla teams everywhere in recent days is like a rising wind and surging clouds, attacking the enemy in various strongholds. The enemy is already feeling overwhelmed. In particular, our guerrilla teams in Qiongshan and Ding'an are even more active, launching repeated surprise attacks on the enemy troops in Qiongshan, Ding'an, and other places, with repeated gains. After our army withdrew from Ding'an, it took control of the surrounding mountainous areas and still held the initiative, surrounding and monitoring the enemy. Now, Ding'an is under our control.</p>
<p>Soldiers and Civilians Vow to Fight to the Death with the Enemy</p>
<p>It has been found that in recent days, the enemy troops have been continuously transferring reinforcements from Weizhou, Taiwan, Xiamen, and Guangzhou to Hainan, actively carrying out expanded invasion operations. It has been found that the defensive line of the enemy on Hainan Island is the ring road around the island, from Wenchang to Lingao, forming an isolated arc. The enemy is still trying to continue to extend this line and advance inland. However, as a result of the heroic resistance of our soldiers and civilians on Hainan Island, the enemy troops in various places have made no progress. Now, our army has built solid fortifications in Ding'an, Chengmai, along the south bank of the Henan River. If the enemy in the north continues to invade, we will resolutely strike head-on. Our security forces, self-defense corps, guerrilla teams, etc., stationed in Dongchuan, Ruixi, and Taiping areas, have more than ten thousand people, and have sufficient supply of weapons, ammunition, and food. They are led and commanded by Wang Yi, commander of the security forces brigade and garrison commander of Qiongya, and are determined to hold out against the enemy to the death. It will be difficult for the enemy to succeed in their attempt to advance further.</p>

<p>Since the enemy landed on Hainan, the situation has been turbulent. Young men with even a slight sense of national consciousness have risen up to fight against the violent enemy. Those who cannot bear the enemy's oppression but have no power to resist have mostly fled in various ways. In the recent ten days, there have been many people escaping from Haikou by sailing boats to Guangzhou Bay and transferring to Hong Kong. Yesterday, a reporter met a merchant who had just escaped from Haikou in a business association and was told about the real situation in Haikou. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>Red Army Female General Rises Up</p>
<p>After the enemy landed in Haikou on the 16th, they dispatched hundreds of cavalry and infantry towards Wenchang County on the 28th. Our side, seeing that the enemy was fierce, retreated to the west of Jiaji (place name) to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Liu Shujue, a veteran Red Army female general, rose up and organized more than 200 male and female guerrillas, who were based in the jungles and fought to the death with the enemy. Although the enemy had sharp artillery fire, they did not know the terrain, and ultimately suffered losses. In this battle, more than 200 of the enemy were killed.</p>
<p>Enemy Merchant Katsuta Acts as Guide</p>
<p>The fact that the enemy was able to quickly occupy Haikou, Xiwei, Haiyan, Saishi and other places was due to the guidance of Katsuta, an enemy merchant who had been in Haikou for decades. The local defense forces were negligent in defense on the one hand, and sparsely manned on the other. After the enemy occupied Haikou, shopkeepers and merchants who had something, ended their businesses and fled, Haikou suddenly became a dead city. Therefore, as soon as the enemy entered Haikou, they were eager to restore the prosperity of the market, while the enemy merchant Katsuta led the enemy troops to the nearby villages to summon the residents to return to the city to do business. Because the people refused, countless people were killed. Some people were forced to flee back to avoid their ferocity. The enemy now supplies funds to the general ignorant masses to open gambling dens, brothels, etc. They also tempt the citizens to organize the "New China Welcome Japan Allied Nations Association", with the traitors Mao and Tang as chairmen, doing all kinds of evil. At present, Haikou has become a world of monsters and demons.</p>

<p>[Wengyuan Quick Report] According to news from military agencies here, the central government is extremely active in the military affairs of central Guangdong. Regarding the entire offensive and defensive strategy, they send telegrams to Commanders Zhang and Yu at any time to follow and implement. After the front lines in central Guangdong have been properly reconfigured, the central mechanical units and heavy artillery units have also entered Guangdong one after another to assist. As for the air fleet, a large team of new-type fighters manufactured in a certain country has also been allocated within the shortest possible time, and another special squadron XX has been placed under the direct command of the Fourth War Zone. It is foreseeable that the war in Baiyue will have a brand-new development.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Quick Report] Since our country's war of resistance, the enemy military has suffered repeated failures, and their intelligence is exhausted. Recently, they have even used economic policy to invade, disguising enemy goods and mixing them into our country. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, privately transporting a large number of counterfeit Central Bank five-yuan banknotes to the south, and instigating traitors to use them in the occupied areas of Guangdong, attempting to disrupt our rear financial system. Our authorities have now ordered all military and civilians to be strictly on guard. The differences between the genuine and counterfeit coins are as follows: (1) Paper material: counterfeit coins have a waxy and smooth surface and are easily broken, while genuine banknotes are lustrous and resilient; (2) Paper pattern: counterfeit coins are blurry, while genuine banknotes are clear; (3) Watermark: counterfeit coins are vague and invisible, while genuine banknotes are clear; (4) Sun Yat-sen's image: genuine banknotes are exquisite and clear, while counterfeit coins are the opposite. The light patterns on the left and right of the image are thicker and blacker than the genuine ones; (5) Characters: genuine banknotes are bright black, while counterfeit coins are rough and dull black. There are no paper water ripples on the left and right of the characters; (6) Patterns: genuine banknotes are brightly colored, while counterfeit coins are the opposite; (7) Red seal: counterfeit coins are bright red, while genuine banknotes are jujube red.</p>

<p>—Yuan Huazhao is Still Alive—</p>
<p>[Shenzhen Quick Report] Yuan Huazhao, commander of the Dongzengbao Guerrilla Commando, has commanded his team in attacking the enemy in the guerrilla areas under his jurisdiction, and has achieved remarkable results. Yesterday, it was reported that Yuan had died of illness. The reporter visited Battalion Commander Wang of the XX Detachment of the unit currently stationed in Shenzhen to inquire about everything. According to Battalion Commander Wang, Commander Yuan suffered from dysentery at the end of last year and went to Hong Kong for treatment, staying at the Imperial Palace Hotel in Kowloon. Because his mother was living in Meiwo, Cheung Chau, Yuan returned home on Lunar New Year's Eve to visit his mother and spend the New Year for several days. Later, the troops received a letter from Yuan saying that the dysentery had healed and he would leave Hong Kong and return to the unit soon. However, due to his sickly body, he feared that he would not be able to cope with the heavy work, and he intended to resign. As for the saying that he died of illness, it is often a rumor. The reporter asked about the recent situation of the unit. Battalion Commander Wang said that apart from a small part of the unit being in Bao'an, the main part is still stationed in various parts of Dongguan Zengyu, attacking the enemy according to the opportunity. Ten days ago, the enemy troops burned Zhangmutou because the XX team of the unit moved from Dongguan to Dalang, captured the chairman of the Maintenance Society, and executed him. Afterwards, the enemy sent troops to search, but our team had already moved to another place. The enemy did not dare to advance any further, so they burned the villages in the area to vent their anger.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Quick Report] In order to mobilize trained young men from all provinces across the country to participate in the war of resistance and national construction, the Military Commission has now telegraphed the National Military Training Offices of all provinces to instruct the general headquarters of the social training corps of all counties to organize the trained young men into volunteer corps, and to organize various task forces for guard duty, construction, transportation, communication, rescue, and first aid. They must all hold separate assemblies and exercises. Furthermore, in order to examine the results of social training in various provinces, it has been decided to send a large inspection team to review the trained young men in various provinces and cities starting from March 1st. Li Jiewen, commander of the military training office, telegraphed all county and city social training chiefs yesterday to inform them.</p>

<p>[Jiangmen Quick Report] The enemy's methods to harm us are extremely despicable. Apart from military means, they use everything. According to military intelligence, the enemy chiefs in South China have made no progress since entering Guangdong for several months. They know that they cannot win by military means alone. Recently, they have come up with a brilliant idea and sent out large groups of spies and instigated traitors to infiltrate our interior. In addition to spying on military intelligence, they also use various methods to mingle with our people, promoting their toxic propaganda and alienating our people. At the same time, in Guangzhou and Foshan, they have sent two or three or four or five Taiwanese and Korean women who have been trained and are familiar with the Cantonese language, who are divided into groups and infiltrate the occupied areas, or live in villages connected to the occupied areas, using their seductive tactics, sweet words, and vigorously promote the enemy military, and incite our ignorant women to prevent their husbands, sons, and nephews from joining guerrilla organizations, in the hope of weakening our resistance. Their intentions are extremely sinister. It has been found that many such incidents of enemy women's activities have recently been discovered in the villages of Sanshui, Nanhai, and Shunde counties. After receiving the report, the authorities yesterday issued a special order to all county governments and guerrilla commanders to strictly prevent and control them.</p>

<p>[Shenzhen Quick Report] Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla, and Zhang Wodong, deputy commander, upon learning that the enemy entrenched in Wancheng Shiling Taiping was troubled and pressured by our guerrilla teams, and had withdrawn one after another, immediately ordered all subordinate units and teams to take advantage of the weak strength of the enemy troops in various places to launch attacks according to the opportunity. After receiving the order, various units have been advancing towards Wancheng Shiling Taiping and other places in recent days, strictly controlling the enemy troops. Liang Baoren, the county magistrate of Bao'an, has also transferred a group of elite troops, travelling along the Baotai Highway to the Huangsonggang Foziao area to set up an ambush, preparing to directly attack Taiping. It should not be difficult to eliminate the enemy troops entrenched in Dongguan County in one fell swoop. It has also been found that Ye Tieliang, commander of the Ninth Battalion of the Dongguan Self-Defense Corps, seeing that most of the enemy troops in Wancheng had withdrawn and their strength was weak, led his troops to launch a night attack on the enemy troops in Wancheng on the 2nd of this month. In the faint starlight, they arrived in Wancheng. The enemy troops were caught by surprise and did not know the strength of our army, so they retreated to a corner and resisted stubbornly. Our team then used its capabilities to surround the enemy on all sides and pounce on them. After more than an hour of melee, as dawn approached, our team gave a secret signal to withdraw in different directions along the original route. As a result of the fierce battle, more than twenty enemy officers and soldiers were injured and killed, and a large number of spoils were seized. At present, there are no more than two hundred enemy troops in Wancheng, retreating to the south of the city, guarding themselves all day long, daring not to move, and constantly panicking.</p>

<p>…The War Zone Command Issued a Notice Yesterday…</p>
<p>[Shaoguan Quick Report] The commander's office of the Fourth War Zone believes that in the past, when the combat troops transferred positions, the destruction of telegraph and telephone lines was often overlooked, which was used by the enemy. Even if there was destruction, it was not thorough. The enemy could use it with a little repair. In the future, before the transfer of each unit, the unnecessary ones must be designated to be withdrawn by the responsible unit as much as possible, depending on the urgency of the situation. Those that should be retained should be thoroughly destroyed when transferring, so that the enemy cannot use them. The destruction methods are as follows, and the subordinate units were ordered yesterday to comply with them: (1) Cut off the pole one foot from the ground. If there is enough time, cut it into several sections; (2) Burn or blow up the telegraph pole; (3) Cut off the wires close to the insulators; (4) Destroy the magnetic insulators; (5) Remove the crossbars on the telegraph poles; (6) Extend the iron wires into the ground between the longitudinal gaps of the telegraph poles; (7) Wrap the heaviest iron wire between the two wires.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Quick Report] Due to the impact of the war, the province's tax revenue has sharply decreased, resulting in a monthly shortfall of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in the province's revenue and expenditure. Gu Yiqun, director of the finance department, in addition to actively increasing revenue and reducing expenditure in order to fundamentally solve the problem, has also requested temporary subsidies from the national treasury. Gu also took the opportunity to go to Chongqing to attend the National Local Bank Conference to visit the central financial authorities and ask for instructions on the future direction of reorganizing the province's finances. According to recent news, Gu brought a new wartime financial plan for Guangdong Province to the north for submission to the central government for review. Once approved, Director Gu will schedule a provincial financial conference after returning to Guangdong, convene financial experts, local financial officials, announce the new plan and various measures, and take a general overview of the financial and economic situation of each county and city in the previous month in order to improve the province's finances.</p>

<p>He said, "We were at the Maine seashore, wanting to film a novel stunt called 'balloon jumping.' The method involved attaching a dozen or more large balloons to a person, having them run a short distance with the balloons, and then jump. The balloons would lift the person up and then slowly bring them down.</p>
<p>'I wanted to jump over a car with the balloons. This required even more balloons. We kept adding them until there were more than thirty. I knew there were too many balloons, and I was hurrying to untie a few when a gust of wind came and blew me off the ground, higher and higher. When I reached one hundred and fifty feet, the only rope connecting me to the ground snapped. In no time, I was at fifteen hundred feet and still rising. Fortunately, a northeast wind was blowing, so I wasn't carried out to sea. I saw my partners on the ground jump into a car and start chasing me. Even more luckily, the route I was flying was parallel to the road below; otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to catch up with me.</p>
<p>'I rose into the clouds, unable to see the ground. I could only hear the sound of their car horns. More and more people gathered to chase me, and I kept rising, to an altitude of three thousand feet, flying into a rain cloud. Moisture condensed on the balloons, adding some weight, and I descended to twelve hundred feet. At this point, a minister among the people chasing me, who was a good marksman, got hold of a rifle and started shooting at the balloons. Thank goodness for his amazing marksmanship. He shot and burst several of the five-foot balloons tied to me, and I was able to return to the ground on solid footing. If his shooting hadn't been so accurate, those bullets could have finished me off!'"</p>
<p>That wasn't all. He once tied himself to the radio mast of a submarine to film the real scene of the submarine submerging. He and the people in the submarine agreed that when he made a certain hand gesture towards the periscope, the people in the submarine would raise or lower the submarine a little. First, they filmed the scene of the deck and turret disappearing into the water, which was not difficult. He made a gesture to sink further; even the periscope was below the surface of the water – this was the most dangerous – only the radio mast he was on was exposed above the water, and the water had reached his waist. He felt it necessary to estimate how long he could hold his breath underwater. Fortunately, the submarine surfaced, averting the tragedy of a drowned photographer. Afterwards, he told people, "I felt that was the best (and last) opportunity to film the submarine submerging."</p>
<p>For a newsreel photographer, climbing the steel frames of skyscrapers and the beams of iron bridges, or even the wings of airplanes in flight, for the convenience of work is not unusual. But sometimes, one can get a good opportunity to travel abroad with a diplomatic mission, like Bob Donahue of Pathé Industries.</p>
<p>At a banquet in London, the Prince of Wales, who was also the Duke of Windsor, was present, but photography was strictly forbidden. Donahue left the dining room and wrote a note to the Prince, saying, "I am a photographer specially sent by my country. It is my duty to photograph Your Highness and the diplomatic personnel of my country. I wonder if I could have the honor of your approval." He returned to the dining room and managed to place the note on the Prince of Wales's plate.</p>
<p>After the meal, Donahue had an opportunity to meet the Prince. He said, "I am the one who wrote that note just now. Can Your Highness allow me to?"</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales looked at him strangely for a moment, nodded, and invited many guests to take photographs together.</p>
<p>A few years later, Donahue was sent to South America to film a sound newsreel of the Prince of Wales. When he approached the Prince, the Prince asked him, "You are the one who wrote me a note in London last time, aren't you?" It seems the Prince of Wales had a good memory.</p>
<p>Sometimes, minor skills outside of photography can also provide great convenience in work. Barney Batchelor, a Fox Movietone newsreel photographer, once encountered this. He danced a "one-step Charleston" well and happened to meet the former King of Greece, who also liked this tune. So, on the condition of teaching him to dance, he was allowed to shoot many films. The two parties traded, satisfied and departed.</p>
<p>King Alfonso of Spain also served as a photographer's apprentice once. That was during a cavalry drill in Guadalajara. A Fox Movietone photographer was there to produce a newsreel. He was a small, thin man from Italy, weighing about one hundred and fifteen pounds. The weather was extremely hot, and he was carrying a camera that weighed almost as much as himself, making it hard to breathe. Alfonso saw his predicament and beckoned him to ask,</p>
<p>"Can your camera be disassembled?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>So, His Majesty the Emperor carried part of the camera, and one of his ministers carried the tripod. And it seemed that His Majesty the Emperor was very interested in this work.</p>
<p>The photographer later said to people, "I have experienced many thrilling and strange things, but having an emperor help me carry the camera is always a great honor."</p>
<p>The more important the person, the more willing they are to cooperate, this is a common belief among photographers.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt never refused to be photographed. He also often used film terms when talking to them. After each shoot, he always liked to ask, "How about it, want to do it again?"</p>
<p>The wife of former President Coolidge was also a photography enthusiast. When people were taking pictures of her and her husband, she would also hold a camera and mingle among them, busying herself. Sometimes when the President walked out of the camera's range, or when one of the photographers suddenly ran out of film, the First Lady would always do her best to help. This event gave them a very good impression, and some people still remember it. President Hoover also once delayed his train for some time to allow them to take photos. These are all good examples of great men not being pretentious.</p>
<p>Filming some people requires a lot of effort, like when Garbo returned after touring Europe. At the same time, some people come to you. These are the starving masses. They flocked to the company, asking to be filmed in newsreels, hoping to evoke public sympathy on the screen.</p>
<p>Newsreels are prohibited from containing scenes with advertising properties, but the late oil tycoon Rockefeller broke the rule once. When the photographer asked the rich man to say a few words during filming, he said, "God bless, God bless everyone." Then he added, "God bless Standard Oil Company"—that was his business. Originally, this last sentence would have been deleted, but this time it was exceptionally preserved, so audiences everywhere could hear his blessing of his own industry.</p>
<p>The photographer, Hurth, who filmed the assassination attempt on President Roosevelt, coincidentally obtained all the footage at the time. However, this is something that can only be encountered by chance.</p>
<p>"I had already set up the lights before the President arrived," he said. "When the President arrived at nine o'clock, I had already pushed the camera into an excellent position. However, the President's car came from the opposite direction, so all I could film was a back view. So I hurried up and said to the President, 'Please turn around and take a front photo.'"</p>
<p>Just as he was speaking, the President turned around, and the assassin fired the gun. Anthony Cermak, who came with the President, immediately fell to the ground in response, and blood splattered on the photographer. The police immediately came up to surround the President, protecting him as he walked outside. Hurth quickly returned to the camera, and he filmed various shots of President Roosevelt going outside and the assassin being arrested. After everything calmed down, he realized how dangerous it was. At the time, the position he was standing in was in a direct line with the bullet. [To be continued]</p>

<h3 id="e71">Re-battle and Re-win, the Chinese Federation Wins the Governor's Cup Again, the Battle Situation is Tense, Four to Five, the United Federation Wins After Losing <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday the sun seemed a little shy and often refused to show its face, but the weather was mild, which was perfect for ball players to be active.</p>
<p>At three forty-five in the afternoon, the great football drama rehearsed in Jia Shan—the Governor's Cup final—attracted ten thousand spectators. The atmosphere was lively, and with two famous actors performing, every moment was tense and every moment was wonderful. It was truly a great drama for the eyes.</p>
<p>I think the overall situation had three 'mores': more changes in the battle situation, more wonderful shots, and more stimulation for the audience. During the ninety-minute competition, both sides had gains and losses, and the battle was tied seven times at a score of 1-0 (West Federation leads, Chinese Federation follows), 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 4-4. Until the last five minutes, the Chinese Federation finally gained one more goal under a fierce attack, establishing the victory.</p>
<p>In this battle for victory, the Western Federation took the lead in one breath, completing the work of the first half with a score of 3-2. However, the Chinese Federation was able to catch up quickly after each goal lost. Therefore, the entire battle situation underwent great changes in the tense sound of chasing. In short, this drama can be called a battle for victory or a battle of pursuit.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had this comment: "The Western Federation's failure to use Gaonu as center forward is really a misstep, and this kind of lineup is beneficial to the Chinese Federation. I certainly don't want to see it change again and become perfect." My meaning refers to the fact that if the Western Federation's front line adjusts Gaoshi to the center or changes again, it will be better than the original. And the facts really came true. Although Gaoshi was absent yesterday and Heshi was nowhere to be seen, it was precisely because of this that its front line was able to improve with the addition of people. The power of the attack was indeed terrible. It can be believed that its front line, if it performs according to the original full team, may not be more outstanding than this.</p>
<p>The most obvious factor for the victory of the Chinese Federation is that the flanking attack method is more effective than the central assault method. The two goals scored in the first half were both due to the flanks. The first goal was a wonderful pass from Guangsen, which was passed to Dehui and scored by Jingxiang. The second goal was Chengtuo's high-speed flanking attack. Gao Luda Shi could not catch it and broke free, and Jingxiang took advantage of the situation and scored a goal. According to this, it can be seen that in a competition, if you want to win, then being good at using the flanks is an indispensable strategy. However, yesterday the Chinese Federation provided very few opportunities for activity on the flanks in the first half, especially on Chengtuo's side. There was not much to show, and the focus was only on the triangular pass in the center, so there was no way to achieve results, and they had to be in a losing position first. As for the third and fifth goals scored in the second half, they were also direct and indirect contributions from the flanks. The first and fourth goals scored by the Western Federation were also due to the flanks.</p>

<p>The Chinese Federation's front line scored five goals, while the rear lost four goals. The distinction between this success and dereliction of duty is very clear. Therefore, the merits and demerits of each guard must be discussed. In my opinion, Jingcheng worked hard in this game, but he could not stop Ambarson's activity. As a result of Am's invasion, the Chinese Federation was in danger. Shaohan's foot injury was not completely healed before he went into battle. His football strength was weak, and his performance was mediocre. Rongying lost a move in the battle with Dixon in the middle. Therefore, there were quite a few flaws in the defense of the three. In addition, the Western Federation's front-line contact was good, attacking from the left and suddenly attacking from the right. The central road was also often threatened, so Jingcheng and Lingsheng did not dare to launch a light attack. However, Lingsheng's attack was very good and was the most outstanding member of the rear. Although Tiansheng often used skill to deceive people, the loss of the fourth goal was the effect of his cleverness backfiring. Rongcai, except for the loss of three goals, was because his observation was slightly lacking in agility. In addition, he was not bad, but since he was newly appointed to this important task, he inevitably showed a little nervousness in his attitude.</p>
<p>I also saw that the supply from the Chinese Federation's front line to the forwards was very small. However, there were more opportunities to find their own way. However, it was not that the forwards did not want to provide more supply. Unfortunately, the rapid invasion of the Western Federation's forwards was too scary, so they still felt that the defense was not enough. Therefore, there were very few attacks and supplies across the midfield. On the other hand, the Western Federation's Dixon, because of the strong cover, could often see the style of attacking with the ball. However, the reason for the Western Federation's defeat also seemed to be in this point. Because Dixon often went out far, Parker and Filswater could not help but come forward at the same time to provide supplies. However, they were completely focused on the attack, and they inevitably neglected defense. Once the Chinese Federation's front line found a way out, they immediately launched a surprise attack, and it was common to see Dixon unable to save in time. Therefore, most of the five goals lost were based on this reason. From this, it can be seen that there are both advantages and disadvantages to the forwards attacking.</p>
<p>In terms of the strength of both sides, the Chinese Federation was originally richer, and it was the result that they should have won the final victory. However, because they could not use the flanks for passing and flanking attacks at the beginning, the progress was difficult and they were trapped in a hard battle. If they had used this move earlier, they might not have been in a precarious situation at all times, and only won the victory in the last nine minutes.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes after the start of the game, the Chinese Federation had a strong momentum, and the five forwards often ravaged the opponent's hinterland, but to no avail because the Western Federation's guards were well-trained.</p>
<p>At fifteen minutes, the Western Federation worked hard and launched a fierce attack. Finally, Ambarson forced a corner kick. The kick was wonderful. Gurney welcomed the ball with a header and opened the record first.</p>
<p>At sixteen minutes, the Chinese Federation took advantage of the kick-off and launched an overwhelming general offensive. All that was seen in the smoke and dust was that Dehui passed the ball to Jingxiang, and Jingxiang swept the ball into the net in the crowd. 1-1, the first time the score was tied.</p>
<p>At twenty-six minutes, Liao Yachen made a sneak attack on the frontier, cutting it just right. George intercepted it and sent it away. Gurney arrived just in time and shot from 20 yards away. Rongcai could not touch it. At this point, the Chinese Federation lost another goal.</p>
<p>At thirty-four minutes, Zhaorong passed the ball to the left, and Chengtuo advanced rapidly alone, dodging Billyburn, and then shooting. The ball was patted out by Golluders. Jingxiang arrived in time and added a kick. The ball went straight into the net. 2-2, the score was tied again, and the tense situation can also be imagined.</p>
<p>At thirty-nine minutes, Tiansheng and Gurney fought each other. The ball was obtained by Dixon, who fired a cold arrow 30 yards from the goal. Rongcai did not expect this, and lost another goal. 3-1, the first half was over.</p>
<p>At thirteen minutes of the second half, Chengtuo copied the border and passed it beautifully. Dehui ambushed under the city and jumped high for a header. Sure enough, he scored. Golluders could not save him. 3-3, the score was not yet divided. The fans in the stands watched with fascination.</p>
<p>At eighteen minutes, Jingxiang got the ball, opened up a path, and made a short pass forward. Zhaorong and Dehui became a double sprint. Wurich and Billyburn could not stop them, and Dehui shot in one. 4-3, the Chinese Federation reversed the situation and won.</p>
<p>At twenty-six minutes, the Western Federation's Ambarson broke through several barriers in a row and handed the ball to Gurney. Tiansheng rushed forward and entangled him. Gurney passed the ball on the baseline, and Kendy rushed towards the ball. It was difficult for even the gods to teach him, so it became 4-4, and the Western Federation returned the color to the Chinese Federation. At this point in the battle, the wonderfulness was fully displayed.</p>
<p>At forty-five minutes, Dehui quickly robbed the ball and sent it to Zhaorong. Zhaorong dodged the guards. At this time, Wurich and others rushed forward to block him. Zhaorong was resourceful. Instead of shooting, he handed the ball to Guangsen, who took advantage of the emptiness and entered. He shot into the corner of the goal, creating a 5-4 victory. After the war was over, the Governor of Hong Kong presided over the award ceremony. In addition to keeping the shining silver Governor's Cup for one year, each player also received a small silver cup. After three cheers, they went down the mountain together.

<h3 id="e75">Nanhua Club Friendly Singles Tennis Final: Chen Zhiqiang Wins Against Huang Funan; Huang Has Enough Experience, But Lacks Endurance <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The friendly singles and doubles tennis tournament organized by the tennis section of the Nanhua Sports Association held the final match between Chen Zhiqiang and Huang Funan at 3 p.m. yesterday at the club's Royal Garden court. As a result, Chen won three to zero and won the championship. Mrs. Cai Dongsheng awarded the prizes afterward at around 4 p.m., and the meeting was adjourned. Chen is brave and good at fighting, running around the whole court without any tiredness. He is especially good at high chops and cuts, and his forehand and backhand shots are also very powerful. Therefore, it did not take much effort for him to win three sets straight. Although Huang has rich experience, he could not do anything about it. Huang is a well-known athlete who has participated in the Hong Kong Open Grass Tournament for many years. His skills have improved a lot. Although he has not reached the point of perfection, his experience is rich, which is something Chen cannot match. Therefore, his loss yesterday was due to lack of endurance and inability to fight for a long time. At the same time, the baseline shots were inaccurate, with frequent mistakes, giving people opportunities. If he did not have rich experience, there would be no room for struggle. In the first set, Chen's momentum was fierce, and he attacked desperately, winning 6-3 first. In the second set, Huang had an advantage, but eventually lost again 5-7 due to lack of stamina. At the beginning of the first set, both sides thought it was the final stage, and the number of wins and losses was at stake, so they all worked hard. Therefore, at the beginning, both sides were in a stalemate, but Huang eventually lost again 4-6 due to lack of stamina. The results were 6-3, 7-5, 6-4. The rankings of each item are also recorded below: Singles champion: Chen Zhiqiang, runner-up: Huang Funan, singles handicap champion: Wu Jinda, runner-up: Zhang Guansheng, doubles champion: Chen Zhiqiang, Lu Guifen, runner-up: Huang Funan, Chen Mianman, doubles handicap champion: Huang Zhichi, Wu Jinda, runner-up: Li Junhong, Ye Guanming</p>

<p>— Liu Dianguang</p>
<p>I woke up the earliest the next morning and, together with Comrade Zhang from the First War Zone, took a car we had brought to inspect the outskirts of Tangjia outside the Barrier Gate. In the distance, we could see the land near the sea, where many important fortifications had been built. In the fields and hills we passed, there were many young guerrillas rich in the struggle for national liberation. The walls were covered with slogans of the "Anti-× Comrades Association." Each guerrilla team had a simple and solemn spirit, which was admirable. On the way, I talked with Comrade Zhang about the people who should have fought but didn't, and those who turned their guns and fled. We both sighed. When we returned to Macau, it was already 9:45. All the comrades were waiting for lunch at Lin's residence. After breakfast, we rested for 45 minutes and did 15 minutes of calisthenics. When it was 10:00, everyone was free to act. We decided to leave at 2:00 p.m. I then visited Principal Chongshi Yan Ming with Principal Chen. Principal Liang has a long history in Macau. He is not only a famous educator, but also an old revolutionary. At twelve o'clock, we were invited to lunch, and among those seated with us were reporters Zhao, Huang, and Lei, as well as Principal Liang's attendants. Their sincerity will never be forgotten. When it was almost time, we shook hands and made an appointment to meet again. At 1:30, Principal Chen ordered a general mobilization and personally supervised the army. Military advisors Tang Linghan and Hu Zhenbiao had already arranged the battle array. The whole team marched out in full armor towards the new port. Military advisor Hu was suffering from skin problems, so he followed in a rickshaw. In an instant, we had reached our destination. The barracks beside the mountain played music to welcome us. Principal Chen said that this was a sign of victory. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Huang Kaiyin</p>
<p>The moment I stepped into the church, I immediately felt a sense of low pressure, and I couldn't help but piously make the sign of the cross on my chest. I held my breath, endured the sound of my feet, and occasionally coughed, and felt ashamed as if I had committed something.</p>
<p>The stained-glass lamp formed a golden fire flower. Standing in the church was the Virgin Mary holding the infant, her expression transcendent, her face radiating a holy and inviolable light. To the side was Christ nailed to the cross, the blood flowing from the nail wounds in his hands and feet already congealed. His tightly locked brows made one feel as if they were experiencing his pain, and thereby feel his greatness. The superb nature of religious art may be one of the important reasons for its irresistible mystery, right? As an atheist, I had to bow here and fall into deep thought.</p>
<p>Sunlight crawled in from the round windows inlaid with yellow, blue, or green colored glass, hanging on the milky white wall, and thus became thousands of auspicious lights, making the room bright and beautiful. The deep yellow door was always open, even though the key was always left in the lock, ready for anyone who was weary of life to come here to confess and pray, with two cold tear streaks on their face. Come on, those standing outside the door! Saint Mary will caress you and forgive your mistakes. Someone dressed in a black robe, shining with silver, will say so.</p>
<p>Let's go outside the door for a tour of the scenery. The landscape is picturesque, the sun is bright, and it is a rare weather in winter. A pillow chair is placed next to the stone railing in front of the steps, so the entire view of the narrow island is clear. This is because the church is built on top of a small hill. When ships return from overseas, and the outline of the peninsula is vaguely visible, the first thing that catches the eye is often this golden-topped building. What a lighthouse on the sea, and don't the bishops and priests who live in the church feel lonely like lighthouse keepers? A huge black dog came wagging its tail. I teased it, and it intimately lowered its head and lay on my knees. It is such a docile creature, and probably also tasted the sorrow of loneliness, and craved someone's company, right?</p>
<p>Below is the boundless sea and the buildings piled up like children's toys. It is already winter, and the leaves are still so tenderly green. The sea is calm, and the waves gently lean towards the shore. I unconsciously have fallen into a landscape painting. According to my past temperament, I would often be unable to help but sing loudly, just as someone said: "Who doesn't want to let out a long sigh of emotion when climbing to the top"? And I even presumptuously had the intention of looking down on everything. But what time is it now, and what place is this? You are so willing to forget yourself; have you long forgotten the fragrance that fills the fields, the pastoral emotions of the pastoral? Look at the end of Dongwangyang connected to the foot of the mountain, the endless land, with a little difference in distance, aren't the people living there like they are in two different worlds? Yes, yes. I was wrong! Thank you for your instructions, so that I don't go to the maze. Alas, how can I forget the familiar fields?</p>
<p>There are many barren, primitive islands nearby. It seems that apart from decorating the simple sea, there is really nothing to them. However, isn't the place where I am standing also a place of rugged mountains and thorny roads? After a hundred years, it has already possessed the scale of a modern city, not to mention that it has now become our place of survival, retaining a life. I can't help but admire the greatness of human power. The sky is vast and quiet. Vaguely watching the passing clouds, I felt waves of thought. When the electric clock on the top of the church suddenly struck six times, a ship from Hong Kong slowly sailed into the harbor, and dusk had quietly stood in front of me.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Fate of Japanese Women <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Feima</p>
<p>We all know that Japanese women are very affectionate and serve their husbands very well. However, because the constitution of this capitalist society of Japan still contains a strong feudal flavor, we can say that the affection of Japanese women is precisely the fatal tragedy of Japanese women.</p>
<p>Hollywood movie companies in the United States once seized on the affection of Japanese women and filmed a new, sad and beautiful film called "Madame Butterfly." Those who have seen that film may feel a kind of yearning for Japanese women. It's not so much wanting such a woman to be considerate and serve, but feeling that if there really is such a woman's love in the world, and if men didn't play with women like that American sailor, then it would be a sweet world!</p>
<p>But this is ultimately an ideal. Precisely because Japanese women are excessively affectionate, Japanese women are even more tragic. Since the War of Resistance, whenever we see Japanese women writing letters to their husbands who are engaged in the war of aggression in China in the newspapers, no matter how biased a patriot we are, we always feel how tragic Japanese women are!</p>
<p>During the "January 28th" incident, the Japanese once organized "Comfort Groups." During this "August 13th" incident, because of the strict news blockade in Japan, although we have not seen any news about Japanese women, we can imagine that facts that are even more tragic than the "Comfort Groups" must be performing a lot in Japan. Not long ago, in Shanghai, two Japanese soldiers committed suicide because their wives became prostitutes in Shanghai to "comfort" the soldiers fighting in China!</p>
<p>The fate of Japanese women is so tragic to this point. But there are even more tragic things. As yesterday's newspaper carried a news report from Tokyo: it said that the Japanese government recently stated that the number of soldiers who died in China was extremely large, and the number of widows left in the country was increasing. The issue of pensions has become a major economic burden for the country. Now, in order to reduce this heavy burden, it is planned to send 30,000 widows to South America, Brazil, after giving them four months of colonial training. Because there are 200,000 Japanese immigrants in Brazil, and many of them are unmarried, they can accommodate this batch of widows. It is also reported that the Japanese Colonial Ministry is also planning to send a large number of widows to "Manchukuo." The request for an annual expenditure of 170,000 yuan was made at the budget session of the Diet a few days ago to provide for the resettlement of widows.</p>
<p>I copied the above news, not to object to or oppose the remarriage of widows, but to feel that such a relocation of widows only increases the tragic fate of Japanese women, which is something everyone can imagine! Why? Because this relocation contains the meaning of aggression!</p>
<p>So how can the fate of Japanese women be improved? Of course, Japanese women need to consider it themselves, but the day when China's War of Resistance finally wins is also the day when Japanese women escape that tragic "relocation" fate!</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——On National Novels</p>
<p>"The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" is a novel based on the story of Zhaojun's marriage to the Xiongnu. There are indeed too many works of art about Wang Zhaojun. Taking Hu Danfeng's "Chronicles of the Green Tomb" as an example, there are more than four hundred poems praising Wang Zhaojun. In terms of popular literature, there is the "Biography of the Bright Consort." In terms of drama, there are also four kinds of Yuan Zaju plays: Ma Zhiyuan's "Autumn in the Han Palace," Guan Hanqing's "Zhaojun Cries," Zhang Shiqi's "Zhaojun Departs the Border," and Wu Changling's "Zhaojun Walks in the Moonlight." Unfortunately, all but "Autumn in the Han Palace" have been lost. Ming and Qing legends include "Records of Making Peace" and "Records of the Green Tomb," as well as Zhou Wenchuan's "The Pipa's Words." Ming and Qing miscellaneous dramas include Chen Yujiao's "Zhaojun Departs the Border" (included in the first collection of Sheng Ming miscellaneous dramas, mistakenly attributed to Zhang Gong's "Wang Zhaojun" instead of "Records of Making Peace," see Lingnan Journal, Volume 2, Number 2), You Tong's "Lamenting the Pipa," and Xue Dan's "Zhaojun's Dream." The latter two are included in "Newly Compiled Miscellaneous Dramas," and Zhen Duo discovered the complete collection of "New Compilation" the year before last. Zhang Shoulin's "Points and Drops in the Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Literary Annual of Yenching University, Issue 1) and Huang Qixiu's "The Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University Folklore Weekly, Issues 121 and 122) have listed all of the above dramas. However, the latest "Romance of Double Phoenixes" legend seems to have been omitted by all. Yushuangyi has a manuscript copy of this legend. Du Yingtao's "Notes on Manuscript Operas Collected by Yushuangyi" in the Journal of Dramatic Studies says: "The Romance of Double Phoenixes," one volume, not divided into chapters, author's name recorded in red, performs the story of Wang Zhaojun, the same as the popular "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" novel. Originally, it consisted of two volumes, upper and lower. This copy only contains the upper volume, a total of twenty scenes, ending with Li Ling copying and executing Mao Yan's family. The lower volume is missing." It is likely that this drama was compiled after "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes."</p>
<p>It seems that "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" is the only novel version. Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Popular Novels" is lost, consisting of eighty chapters. Zhang Shoulin believes it was published in the mid-Qing Dynasty and has a popular edition. This book mostly takes from "Autumn in the Han Palace," "Records of Making Peace," and "Chronicles of the Green Tomb" and slightly alters them. "For example, in Autumn in the Han Palace, Zhaojun plays the pipa, and Emperor Yuan hears it," thus gaining favor. In the novel, it is changed to being heard by Empress Lin, who then tells Emperor Yuan, adding another layer of complication. A line in Autumn in the Han Palace says: "A flaw mars this inch of autumnal wave of her eyes." The novel says: "A small black mole is drawn under each eye in every picture."</p>
<p>Records of Making Peace says that Zhaojun draws her own portrait, and the novel agrees. Records of Making Peace says that the official Su Shanyin replaces Zhaojun in marriage, and the novel agrees, but there is no name for the palace maid. Records of Making Peace writes of Zhaojun appearing in Emperor Yuan's dream after her death, asking him to take her younger sister, Wang Xiuzhen, and the novel agrees, only changing Wang Xiuzhen's name to Sai Zhaojun.</p>
<p>Currently, only two scenes, "Departing the Border" and "Sending Zhaojun," remain from Chronicles of the Green Tomb. Recently, Zhu Chuanming and Hua Chuanhao of the Xiandian Society have performed it several times, with very good dance movements. This drama features the imperial brother Wang Long sending Zhaojun off, and the novel also follows this idea, only changing Wang Long to Liu Wen (the same name as the main character in "Visiting the Grave").</p>
<p>In this way, the novel "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" can be said to be a compilation of legends.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Li Changren (Continued) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tian</p>
<p>The sun had long set below the mountains, and the earth was now ruled by the god of night. Anxious to leave this oppressive and dangerous area, the two of them had no choice but to grope their way forward through the pitch-black night. The rugged mountain roads, the muddy riverbanks, whether there were * people ahead, whether there were bandits behind them – they had no time to consider any of it, only to speed up their pace.</p>
<p>Estimating the distance they had run, it was about three in the morning. They arrived at a place where a very high earthen embankment blocked their path. From the darkness, with no moonlight but only a few faint stars, they could vaguely see that this embankment was not only twenty or thirty feet high but also seemed to stretch endlessly on both sides.</p>
<p>"Eh! The front * is probably a trench, right? We have to be careful going up!" He warned the messenger.</p>
<p>The slope of the embankment was about sixty degrees. After much struggling to climb and fall, they finally reached the top of the earthen embankment. But the moment their toes stepped up, they touched two parallel railroad tracks. Along with the gusts of southeast wind, the sounds of distant groans drifted to their ears. Li Changren stretched his long waist, his hair standing on end a little. Unexpectedly, as they were carefully walking, three stiff corpses were strewn beside the road, a little more than ten feet ahead. Two 79 rifles were thrown on the ground. Without hesitation, they picked up the two rifles and continued to move forward.</p>
<p>A train station was ahead, and they could vaguely recognize it. They walked to the stone plaque with the station name, but because of the dim light, they could not make out the words on the plaque. Fortunately, he had the advantage of his tall stature. He forcefully raised his heels and desperately raised his arms. At the same time, he used the sense of touch of his fingers and finally made out the three words "Jishan Station."</p>
<p>"Ah, Jishan, that's not far from the * village where my relatives live." In the faint starlight, the messenger could see some relief appearing on Li Yin's face. In order to determine the direction of the * village, they finally relied on the distant barking of dogs to explore their way forward. But because they had increased the weight of the guns on their backs, their speed was inevitably slower than before.</p>
<p>They entered the village and arrived at the home of his relatives. After changing into local clothes and eating a comfortable meal, they had a chance to rest temporarily. The east was about to turn white.</p>
<p>The sun shone in through the window. As soon as he got out of bed, the sounds of gunfire came from outside the village. The villagers cried out in panic, "The * people are coming!" Then they took the old and the young and fled in a panic toward the back road of the village. Li Changren mixed in with the crowd and left the village. He arrived at the foot of a tree on a hill on the other side of the river and was resting there when the messenger had long since disappeared. As he was still in shock, he looked back and saw that the roofs of the * village were quickly being engulfed in plumes of white and black smoke, and in a little while, the entire sky was stained red!</p>
<p>As he was about to step across a small river more than ten feet wide, a team of horses with strange and harsh noises galloped up from behind. Li Yin knew it was unavoidable and was forced to pretend to be carrying his back and walk faster, mixed in with the fleeing villagers.</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey..." Their hurried footsteps were stopped by the * soldiers who were close behind.</p>
<p>Forced to turn their heads, their faces pale and white, they looked up and saw a large group of * soldiers on horseback holding rifles. They were shouting something, their hands frantically pointing forward and then suddenly pointing backward. Li Changren and the refugees could only stare at them blankly.</p>
<p>Perhaps the * soldiers understood the barrier between their languages. Two of them jumped down from their horses and busily took out notebooks and pencils from their pockets and wrote:</p>
<p>"Are there Chinese soldiers here?"</p>
<p>Li Changren examined their attitude. It did not seem that they intended to do evil to him personally, and their expressions showed a considerable degree of panic. Li Changren frowned and thought clearly in his mind, intending to try his empty city strategy.</p>
<p>"Yes," he mustered his courage, snatched the pen from the * soldier's hand, and replied to them.</p>
<p>"How many?"</p>
<p>"Many," Li Changren further probed him.</p>
<p>Sure enough, upon seeing such a reply, these two * soldiers immediately increased their level of panic and shouted:</p>
<p>"Many? Many! Very many? Many..."</p>
<p>The * soldiers behind him were attracted by the tense expressions of the two men and jumped down from their horses one after another. Five or six hands pointed to Li Wei's "many" in unison. Everyone's faces were covered with an expression of panic and doubt, and they asked in unison:</p>
<p>"Many? Many? Many..."</p>
<p>Li Changren's heart changed from fear to complacency. He deduced that his plan had been successful and that he had taken the initiative. But in a flash of thought, in order to avoid being entangled by the * soldiers, he planned his second escape plan, and he wrote again:</p>
<p>"That was yesterday."</p>
<p>"Ah! Yesterday!" The * soldiers cheered as if they had been relieved of a heavy burden.</p>
<p>"Where are they now?" A * soldier who spoke Chinese with about five or six points of accuracy rushed to ask.</p>
<p>"Toward that way," Li Changren randomly pointed to the left and said.</p>
<p>"Ah..." They shouted wildly in a mix of satisfaction, each of them mounted their horses and galloped off to Li Changren's right.</p>
<p>The hooves of the * soldiers' horses gradually disappeared in the dust in front of them. The refugees standing behind Li Changren, who had been frightened to the point of turning pale, breathed a sigh of relief, on the one hand, despising the * soldiers' cowardice, and on the other hand, admiring Li Changren's wit.</p>
<p>On his lonely journey, in his crazy wandering, one day, he finally arrived at his unit, at the original garrison location before being ordered to move out – * * village, Panyu County – He hurriedly ran into the usually most prosperous street in the village, but now he could not find half a person. Only many hungry cats and stray dogs in the streets and alleys were howling wildly, welcoming the man who had wandered from afar. (The End)</p>
