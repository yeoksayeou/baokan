<h3 id="c1">我國最低限度的要求 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本月二十二日我國代表顧維鈞向國聯行政院提出兩項要求：其一是通吿會員國家擴大其對華財政的物質的援助，中止供給日本的作戰工具及原料；其二是組織一個團體以聯合推進各種步驟。這些要求，在我們為維護世界和平及正義而苦鬥二十二個月的今日，實在是一種最低限度的要求。我們不只是為着我們民族的獨立生存而犧牲，我們並且充當着維護反侵略陣綫的前哨，同時也就是歐美各民主國家遠東利益的衛兵。正如顧代表所言：『如果中國開始卽已屈服於日本威脅之下，或中止抵抗日本的侵畧，聽任日本獨佔遠東，則對於民主國家在遠東權益，及對於目前歐洲緊張局面的影響，不待智者亦可知了』。</p>
<p>顧代表所提要求第一種包括四項細目：（一）會員國家擴大其對華財政的及物質的援助，以增强中國的抵抗侵略的實力及救濟難民工作：（二）避免一切足以削弱中國抵抗侵略的行為：（三）中止以作戰工具及原料供給日本，尤其是飛機與汽油，以免更增其侵略兇燄；（四）限制日本貨品的輸入。這種要求的大部份內容，在各會員國實行起來，都非常便利而且有　。財政的及物質的援助，在資本過剩及生產豐富的國家，是一種適當的出路，在中國的債務信用依舊鞏固的今日，各國都儘可大胆放債的。削弱中國抵抗力量的行為，雖然沒有舉出事實，但若為擬一例，那末就是：中國英勇抗戰的國際宣傳，　　　　　　　的曝露，有時遇到有些國家或地方政府的抑制甚至於壓迫。這種事實是各國急應避免的，而實行起來非常容易。停止供給作戰工具及原料給日本，在日本財政陷於破局的今日，是一種極危險的事情，記得美國政府曾經警吿廠家及貿易商人，勿隨便賒貨給日本，各國人士當尙記得淸楚吧！至於限制日貨入口，對於商品市塲被日本侵奪的國家，特別是英國東方的屬地，是一種極有利的辦法。各會員國實施這些條件，是輕而易舉，收效却非常之大。</p>
<p>上列各種要求的實施上，需要適當的主體與辦法，因此，顧代表又提組成一個團體的要求，這種團體正與國聯制裁意大利侵略阿比西尼亞時候的五十二國委員會類似，目的在於聯合協力推進。單獨的行動常會鬆懈下去，所以這個團體是非常重要的。實行盟約第十六條規定，也有這種小組委員會的必要。可惜，英法只承認聯合行動的原則，而以歐洲危機未完全解决為藉口，說此項聯合行動的基本因素當未具備。英法的看法是非常的機械，以為歐洲危機未完全解决以前，遠東問題的解决仍須有待，殊不知世界問題是整個的不可分的，中國問題和歐洲問題更有密切的關係，假定中國早對日本屈服，則英美法不但在華權益完全喪失，即其東方屬地也己岌岌可危，而英法在歐洲地位更要受到威脅，日本帮兇德意自會加緊侵逼英法。英法支配下的國聯對於我國的要求，不能僅僅重申上次的建議，希望能有更具體的聯合辦法，以孚我們最低限度的要求。</p>
<h3 id="c2">西綫十戰士　晉東南特約通訊 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 狄平</p>
<p>這　寫寫了十個晉冀察邊區的戰士和民衆對侵略者作戰的小故事，假使讀　不把它當作太小的瑣聞來讀的，由　裏　可知道：中國的戰事是如何活潑增英勇地在戰鬥着，一切　衆組政治力量又　如何的在淪陷地帶培　起來，而另一方面。法西斯侵略者的士兵們又是如何的深陷在頹廢澳喪反戰情緒的泥沼澤，一切都在變　舊，　潮　會變成巨浪的。相信　，潮水也自有它奔　的方向。</p>
<p>一，三金牙</p>
<p>干排長，矮個子，大眼睛，滿口湖南話講的饗呱呱的。</p>
<p>十多個戰士　看他搜索公路附近山坡，　，他們　來只出來散散步而已</p>
<p>冬日，太陽倆　懶洋洋的，　兒都掀到惱後頭。　午時，她們　擺到山角下浩軍道岔路的旁邊。</p>
<p>幾　　笛，一溜　風。</p>
<p>「媽的，可　十了！」</p>
<p>「躱！」王排長下了命令。</p>
<p>十多個戰士依靠着　　的石頭。散　作山谷裏，十排長鑽到山腰　在叢蒿的肯待，兩眼象　　的野貓，從陷暗裏　遠處坡下，凝視着。</p>
<p>都　　都，一輛，二輛，三蛹，飛過去了。再遠的來路上，氣笛聲史無鬧，大團的灰廖也向這裏飛。</p>
<p>「轟！」</p>
<p>手溜彈徒天上掉下來，無　的炸彈，槍彈，都從靜臥的石頭後面飛來，一切殺聲，叫喊，騷亂，都從寂靜裏，突然地壞發了。</p>
<p>爬來的十　隻黑猪，停止了汽笛叫喊。塞滯在岔路口。後面未趕上的，調頭急向來路竄。</p>
<p>穿過衣的侵略者的士兵，本來就很担心的，　知今天的當眞的倒了霉，急忙跳下　車來，四下裏找隱物，不料遺沒有跑　大石跟前那後面躱藏著的主人，就幾槍放過去，使他永遠也起不來了。</p>
<p>小個子的王排長，想著奪洋料，他發在汽中前面躺者一個黃衣的兵十他走向跟前，一把抑住黃　子，原想剝下那張皮，誰知那傢　是半裝死，組壯的漢子，上，摟住了子排長的腰　個身把他　在地，他　，兩手　說不得就一口咬住那黑的肥腮，一掃黑的　子，拌　着　糊寨在嘴　。</p>
<p>那　　在極　劇，之下鬆了力。王排長才掙脫地翻過來，輪在鈅漢子身上，懷中掃出炸彈　錘，在對方的腦袋上亂敲了一陣，那傢伙暈　了，上大股的流着血，一直到兩腿迫挺挻地仲遠的時候。</p>
<p>王排長恨恨地爬起來，吐出咀與帶毛的生肉，跟着葉出了自己的三個門曲</p>
<p>一場惡戰結果，點綴一下，未　掉的黃衣人，山均下，路旁還躺了廿多個，自已毫無損失，只是排長咀裏吐了血</p>
<p>汽車上的東西。盡可能，背走；其餘交給老百姓燒光。</p>
<p>不久，王排長鑲上金牙了，全營裏也傳遍了這個故事，於是『三金牙』就代替了他的名字。</p>
<p>二，放朋友槍</p>
<p>×路軍難到一個村裏，羣衆工作正在開始。</p>
<p>一天周圍村子裏，乒乓乒乓打起槍來，並且像慢慢地向　重圍攻的梯子，帶隊官下了命令！退出村外，準備着戰鬥的姿熊。</p>
<p>據老百姓報吿，瞟來是偽組絨奉軍命來攻。</p>
<p>『戰士們！少放槍！一齊喊中國人不打中國人！』——這是一個命令。</p>
<p>口號　　喊着，越喊越高，對方的槍聲也越　越稀。</p>
<p>槍聲沒　了。對方派來了代表。</p>
<p>『原諒！原諒！我們，麽會打你們呢』</p>
<p>『是呵！我　那是中國人！』</p>
<p>『侵略者逼着，們這　　沒法不赫從的。』</p>
<p>『先生！那怎麽能行啦！』</p>
<p>『是樣吧，以後定我們放朋友槍，槍口都向大上打，絕不撒謊的，沒子彈我們贈你！』。</p>
<p>『　的！』</p>
<p>代表走了，戰爭又開始，口號沒有了。松聲響的十劇烈。</p>
<p>太陽　山了。戰爭也停了，仍是那個代表到侵略者的軍司令部報功，受司令官的現自招待。</p>
<p>代　：『遺一次打的劇烈極了，我們眞是拚命的幹呢』！『哩　好。努力』！司令官滿高興</p>
<p>「報吿子彈打了幾十萬發」。</p>
<p>「啊」！司令官睜了大眼睛，『那只好再補發給你』。</p>
<p>箱的領下，大擔的挑囘，代表領着原　不動的送給×路軍，半夜裏，莊稼人的挑担隊，走的像一溜風。</p>
<p>一次兩次都是如此，×路軍政治工作的酵母在發着泡沬，『覺醒』像一團烈火在　燒着偽組織里面的農民，他們以為這樣應付也怪訋獸，於是决定乾脆地拉過來——抗戰。</p>
<p>代表又來了，約定日于，請營長去收編軍隊。</p>
<p>一天，營長帶着少數軍隊以防萬一，多帶的是　馬，大車，預備辦交代　收秦西。</p>
<p>戰士散開了，包圍在莊村外，營長帶養一兩個衛兵和大南隊拉進村子裏。</p>
<p>從早到午仍沒有出來也沒有動靜，戰士們着了急，營長和對方的領袖恐怕協　不成了。</p>
<p>星子裏營長和對方談判：</p>
<p>「怎麽辦　？改天　！」偽組識的帶隊領袖說。</p>
<p>「為什麽呢」？</p>
<p>「媽的！他，眞狡賴他們承許我義千袋麵粉，幾十萬發子彈，還有馬匹，媽的，他們又搗蛋改期了，到如今還沒有交過來。」</p>
<p>「那沒有關係，只要弟兄們肯收編就訓就是了。」</p>
<p>『那　舉行，我們帶不走東西是不好意思的。』</p>
<p>「照你說，我帶來的軍隊。大軍怎麽辦呢了」</p>
<p>『集合囘去好了，只要東西到手，我們自動拉遇去。』</p>
<p>營長帶奢戰士大車又走了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，偽軍方面，秘密增派來了政治　導長。他混在連衆裏，不久，偽軍的人。　。輕　，裝的　滿　大卒。一心都拉走了　死了上司，變成了抗戰的軍隊。</p>
<p>三，順民證</p>
<p>×路軍幾個政治工作人員，徑　　冀察邊區囘到延安，一匹馬駝着行李，人背着輕裝。</p>
<p>照指定的路　走，大概沒有問題，一天，二天，到了正太路附近進入，戒　，但那練的走路者，有些不在意。</p>
<p>下午，淪陷地帶的太陽，使人懶散，沈默，寂　的村莊裏隱藏著神稀與受辱的　慌。</p>
<p>他們走在山谷旁邊，對面　著高山，村莊人家住在山坡事。正走路時，磕頭跑來了一個莊　漢，一把抓住李君的左臂，東看西看的，他沒有發現「　路」二字的符號。</p>
<p>『先生，你是不是×路軍了』</p>
<p>李君從　裏摸出「×路」，的×章，他明白這符號在老百姓面前會幫助他解决許多問題。</p>
<p>『前面可是走不得二百多的騎兵剛走過去，——來！來！　我向後轉！』</p>
<p>馬被他拉轉囘頭，沒！法，老百姓的話總該相信的，只有跟着他走。</p>
<p>太陽落山，已入夜的時候了，用不着推辭就被莊稼人引到他家——緊靠鐵路旁的一個村莊。</p>
<p>聽說×路軍來了，老頭子，小孩，　出來忙碌地招待着他們吃了晚餐，安然住下。</p>
<p>第二天，老漢不讓走。</p>
<p>「先生，路還沒有探期白，慌哈哩」！</p>
<p>白天無事，爬在　頭偷存鐵路，一列火軍　蝸牛爬過來，軍輛不多掛着兩個車頭。</p>
<p>『老先生，怎麽兩個車頭呢』？</p>
<p>『囑！燈你下會知道的，連天來轟炸鐵路的網是數不怕，不知什麽時候，游擊隊就把炸彈埋在路軌下，火東夸通夸的正走着的時候。不防就來徇　崩」的一聲——厲害！眞歷害！——這　兩個車頭，炸前　往後拉，炸後怕往前拉，炸中間兩頭拉，嘿嘿……怪好看哩』！</p>
<p>『那的！履他們想得出』！</p>
<p>『咱們長了見識』，老漢說。</p>
<p>又到夜裏，年輕的莊稼漢，囘來了，說：『路可以走了，沒有問題』，於是人又背上輕裝，馬又駝上行李。</p>
<p>知勞師動衆，竟　於此，他們自動動員了全村的莊稼漢。放　放十幾　，全村人擔心著護送這幾個陌生的行路人。</p>
<p>凜冽的寒風流遺在原野，大家的脚步合在一起。五六十歲，多長鬍子的老漢，捧茶　：</p>
<p>『先生，你喝吧，這裏給你們備着開水。』</p>
<p>行路人感動的落下淚來，政治員善說話的嘴巴，這時候竟不知怎樣的來表白自己。</p>
<p>『老鄕。你們太好了。』</p>
<p>『先生，你不知道，黑夜，白天，我們都在盼望着你們打過來。』</p>
<p>走着。走着。一　到東方黎明的時候。臨別時，老漢三番五次的指說村路，再三可嚀，方肯走囘去。</p>
<p>微白色的晨光裏，照見了他門每個人的衣襟上　綴着侵略者頒發的『顯民護』的布牌子。</p>
<p>法西斯蒂的瘋狂侵略有，他們怎麽知道中華民族的靈魂永遠埋在中華民族人民的心裏！</p>
<p>四，小孩捉間牒</p>
<p>早飯後，圓洞似的寨門裏成　地走出了　稼人，牽着耕牛，背着犂耙，游擊根據　的民衆，仍是　常的勞作着。</p>
<p>在家的人稀少了，只有兩個十幾歲的小孩子在寨門外路口　着石孑，互相打駡著。</p>
<p>『你這××！昨個你為啥不到東溝去　？』</p>
<p>『×你媽：俺伯昨天叫我放了半饗牛！』</p>
<p>順大路走來了兩個兵士，一個背著步槍，一個背　　皮鞘的大刀，胸前滴溜着個炸鐸，走到寨鬥跟前踟躕了一下，敦問：</p>
<p>『小孩，裏面有「×路」沒有？』</p>
<p>『沒有』。兩個士兵走進夫了，臂膀並沒有披帶『×路』的臂章莊號。</p>
<p>兩小孩懷疑來起，小面孔呆住了，四零小眼怔怔地注視着。</p>
<p>『媽的跟　他』　大的說。</p>
<p>『走』！</p>
<p>『兩個兵士走進一家飯鋪里，坐在茶棚下，他烟，要開水。樣子是有些狼狽　憊小堪。</p>
<p>兩個小孩在旁邊打圈子，四隻眼睛，擠　　購，傳送著意兒，向兩個兵士渾身上下都打量遍了，一點沒有×路軍的符號，設話態度和『×路』也不條。</p>
<p>這兩個小孩，從兩個兵士的乾嘴唇黃面孔，黑牙爾這些特微上尋出了空隙</p>
<p>這時候，一仰兵士和飯舖老板打了咕嚕後，提着槍，炸彈，兩個人到裏間去了。</p>
<p>大些的小孩一擺手，他已認淸了對　的來由，他們兩個就飛也似的　進另一個街道弄巷裏。</p>
<p>兵士解下槍，炸彈，大刀，　在飯舖裏間的坑上，發亮的大姻燈，燈旁的　銅色的煙泡，界雲葉霧，一切忘懷，</p>
<p>兩個小孩笑瞇瞇地又轉囘來了，隨後街口處以出了紅纓槍，士砲，大刀等。</p>
<p>飯舖裏面是嘶嘶　抽烟，外面是唧唧嚷嚷地商議，　勢越來越緊張。</p>
<p>『媽的，不是逃兵，就是叛徒』！决定了這兩個兵士不是好傢伙，於是仍叫兩個小孩先下手。</p>
<p>兩個　孩互相吵起來，罵起來，打起來，拉養滾到飯舖裏間去。兩個小孩打架是當有的事，抽的正酣的人當然是不會在意的。</p>
<p>誰知兩個小孩子，手疾眼快，上去一把槍，刀，兩　提出炸彈，無里住外面跑，這時候外面拿着　纓槍，大刀的漢了們，一齊鄱　這　問云。</p>
<p>『綁住！』</p>
<p>『拉出去搜！』</p>
<p>也沒有法官，也沒有法堂就任大　上你一點我一句的公審起來，詳細　的結果：知道他們是假光×路軍，被派水偵探這裏的　實，同時是準備着向中國軍來一次大圈攻。</p>
<p>侵路者在作夢，無知的叛徒白肯來送死，就在圓　似的寨門外的　　，添起了兩個土塚，新潤的黃土上染著殷紅的血。</p>
<p>夕陽掉在晚誰用的時候，大羣的人又牽着耕牛背著看物耙從田裏囘來。仍像流水似的走進園洞的寨門里。</p>
<p>兩個小　還在那裏玩着向過往的們叙說今天的故事。</p>
<p>五，懷彈進城</p>
<p>孫，李，張，三位戰士，穿上老百姓服裝，懷著揣上炸彈，進城去買東西。</p>
<p>往日的慣例：侵略者的兵士小大會說中國話，所以對老百姓盤問也無從盤問起。因之，進城的人，走進城門離崗兵三十步的地方，只要脫下帽子、個躬，表示順民，不用　就可進去了。</p>
<p>這一天，三位戰士胞著往日的慣例做了，但出乎意外的來了個不幸的難，兩個的兵　什他們。上下打量，非搜察不可。</p>
<p>『非搜察不可？』三戰士心裏有些不願意。</p>
<p>『嫣的，懷裏有炸彈怎樣能破　查呢？不如索性動了啊！』他們心　拿定了主意。</p>
<p>『碰』的一聲，一縣炸彈五在那兩個兵士的中間，像分開的兩扇門，兩條死屍對着倒下了。</p>
<p>炸彈饗了，還往那裏的跑也跑不掉的，不如就勢衝進城去吧。于是爬上城樓對準侵略者的住所，猛烈地轟了一頓，又炸死了好對個，奪了幾枝槍。</p>

<p>（四）血戰連城橋</p>
<p>四月廿四日夜，×以全力進攻高安東北二里的連城橋，形勢岌岌可危。某代師長下令朱守　　自動斬斷連城橋，背水一戰，全局因以轉危爲安。廿五日，代師長以該營官兵勳功卓　　調　第二　整休，記者於該日恰隨　師長赴前綫視察，至高安西北三里的龍王朝，正遇該營士兵，剛自前方調下，滿身都是黃泥，連面目都分不淸楚。身上子彈　最多剩廿餘發，有的已顆彈無存。認營一部因沒有與後方運絡到，已兩天沒有吃飯。代帥長問他門：「長官因爲沒有連絡到，未能將飯送上，你們心裏苦不苦？有什麼感想沒有？</p>
<p>一個班長囘答說：「革命軍人不怕苦；不怕死，不怕餓。×人比我們更苦，他們一樣沒有飯吃。　』</p>
<p>另一個上等乓接下去說：「因爲我們死守住陣地所以現在有飯吃。而×人因爲沒有人換防，到現在還沒有飯吃。」說完了，大家臉上都泛出一種勝利的微笑。代師長繼續問：「昨晚營長以下官兵百廿餘人中毒，陣地一度動搖。後來自己　橋破壞，　你們誓死守住，背水一戰，當時你們心裏怕不怕？想不想向後面　？』</p>
<p>他們一致的囘答是：「不怕！」另有一個排長更侃侃地說着：『我們不但不怕，並目在昨天夜裏，還給×人很很　衝殺了一下。只是因爲天黑雨大，我們這一排當夜就沒有與連部及營部連絡到，不過我們心裏並不怕，因爲日本人對於地形，比我們更不熟，在夜裏地亦運絡不到，假使我們向後跑，後面部隊還只當我們是×人，晚上誤會，恐怕反被打死，同時長官亦不允許我們向後面跑。所以我們死守在那裏。到今天上午二時以後，我們這一排還在山坡上一個關帝廟裏能睡了　覺呢。</p>
<p>到這裏，某代師長轉對記者說：「有這機好的七乓，中國是絕不會滅亡的！也絕非任何國家所能亡得了的！假使抗戰到今天，在後方養尊處優的人們中間，還有些失敗主義或　觀論者的話，最好請他們組織，個觀察團，到前綫來巡視一下，包管他們會全盤自動地否定他們過去的觀點。」</p>
<p>（五）父子報仇</p>
<p>述長朱　平，今年已是五十多歲的一員老將了。他河南正陽人，行伍出身，由歷次功績累　到連長、</p>
<p>四月廿五日、他奉命攻擊高安東北九華甩的白石嶺。這裏×人築有三度鐵絲網、工　向東北南皆有、向西較少。朱連長就率領全連士兵由四向東攻擊。當攻擊前進至第一道鐵絲網，全連已犧牲至只剩卅餘人。因步兵對破　鐵絲網，沒有工具，至此攻擊受了頓挫。同時因距×較近，事實也不允許中途退下。結果用鎗柄十字鍬等，好容易把鐵絲網破　了一部份。爬進至第二道鐵絲網，這時×我間的距離已在手溜彈擲程內　由，×對西火力配備較少向西據又無掩蓋，朱連長乃以一手溜彈　去，彈適命中，斃×十餘人，餘×狼狽棄鎗後遁，朱速長就抑動全軍，全面攻擊前進，卒被×第三道鐵絲　所出，我雖亦擊斃×二三十，但禁不住×南北兩據點內機槍全部出動，交叉夾擊，該連因以全部殉國，屍未得下。朱連畏有個兒子在團部任服務員，當國個消息於下午二點鐘傳到團部，再傳到地的兒了耳裏，正似一個晴天霹靂一股。他痛心到絕處，决定要求團長撥給一部士兵，歸他指揮，要把他父親的屍體找囘來。團長嘉其孝，允許派兵晚上同他去摸，如白大前往，恐徒勞無功，朱服務員對這點也同意，就耐。也等着。</p>
<p>當　黃昏人靜後，團長　派了六個偵察兵隨未服務員前往尋覓乃　屍　，直到廿　日淸晨不見他們囘來、也得不到一點關於他們的消息。廿六日下午　時，白右嶺被　　部攻佔　　團　報告，我軍於淸　戰場時、發現朱服務員的屏電，正在他　親的屍體旁邊、相距不到五來突。</p>
<p>某　師長嘉具忠　，特將該父子遺屍，葬於　石嶺原屏發現所在地　立　牌　名曰「雙忠墓」。</p>
<p>（六）力疾從戒的王　長</p>
<p>高安城自廿二日起，　被我圍得桶相似，爲短少重兵器，城　攻不下。城內×雖惶　萬　，然　頃抗待援，我爲减少損失計　乃由諳習日語機　連長王可崇，寫了封說降的信（其時王連長還在病中）。派一班長手携白旗爲軍使去投遞，按照典範令，一國對另一國手携白旗軍使，例有　護之責，不應加以槍殺結果該班長只跑？半路上　就被×寇打　了。王連長聞訊，乃不顧一切，自告奮勇，搶病前往。當時他自　以爲信上寫的究不澈底，如自己去，可以和　　話，當面去說服他們，不更好嗎？那裏知進自稱文明國家，官揚王化」的『皇軍』，竟蔑視國際法令，不層軍人應守條例，而開槍射　了。王連長便在這樣情形下，又光榮地掛了彩。</p>
<p>自此以後，部隊中每個弟兄，更經騐了一次血的敎訓，而對××有了更一步的認識。</p>
<p>（七）留作一個紀念</p>
<p>由祥符觀　十高途中，經過村前再。因爲天氣太熱雖然還只是五月的太陽　晒　身　　　　很感有炎亦日　之苦。因之就在村前街一所茶肆前，買了壺茶，坐下解渴。</p>
<p>在記者鄰桌上坐着兩個弟兄，是傷愈重上前綫的老戰士。他們正在滔滔不絕地談警他們運去英勇作戰的情形。</p>
<p>茶肆　排列着許多長凳，凳上放着五　祖架。根架上躺着　兵，都是新從前線送下來的。其中一個傷兵　傷　重，呻吟得分外凄厲，在記者鄰座一位　王鐵的同志聽得有些不耐煩，禁不住站起來高聲　着：「同志你中了幾槍？」</p>
<p>「阿……哦……中……了三槍哪！」担架上掛，的同志忍　痛囘答着。</p>
<p>這一個回答，誰也更不　那位王司志竟會發怒起來：「你這傢伙，眞是個秣屎！（記者按稀屎覓雲南土語。駡人之無用也。）你看找中了十一槍！一說着就把袴管勒上，上身軍　除下，就露出了一個魁梧結實的軀體來，在腿部胸部手部，不多不省，十二個大小不等的彈痕。</p>
<p>王同志邊說邊數着他榮譽的彈傷痕，似乎在對記者和傷兵們作擴人官傳一般：　一個人要掛了彩不喊痛，才是眞的好　，眞的英雄。我上次中了十二顆子彈，我還有然掙扎着，把槍帶下，我從來就忍耐沒有叫過一聲痛，因爲你愈叫痛，他就痛得愈厲害，並且，可　　影響到具他的　況。一</p>
<p>架上受傷　同志，經他　樣一　說教，眞的就此不哼了。王同志此時　左　肌肉用二手按下去，當中就突起一個子彈人的硬塊。王同志指着它說：「還有　顆彈沒　取出來　！」說着衛微笑。</p>
<p>此時記者地也不能冷眼旁觀了，就岔進去問他：「爲什麼不把它取出來呢？」</p>
<p>王同志的回答，始終不是我們所能思像得到的，他微微地笑着。顯得很輕鬆地回答記者說：「醫官哨：「這顆子彈不取出也沒有什麼大關係。於是，我就決定把它留作我參加此次抗戰的一個永恆的紀念，一個永恆的紀念。」（中央社）</p>

<p>這幾天海上風雲，險惡萬狀。祇就昨今兩天各報用大號刊登的消息而言，值得中外人士嚴重注意的，至少有以下幾則：</p>
<p>第一是廿　日英商鐵行郵船公司蘭蒲拉號之突遭日本海軍襲擊與非法搜檢，這一事件還　注意的，一是出事地點僅在距本港一英里的海面，二是該輪上尙有英國新任駐華　軍第五巡洋艦隊副司令麥萊少　，第三，英日兩國幷非交戰國，英國船舶決不能容許此種騷擾，</p>
<p>第二，是止四日法郵亞林美士號之突破日本海軍非法搜索達一小時，出事地點亦祗　　港十七海里的海面！</p>
<p>第三，是鼓浪噢情勢之愈　嚴重，日本主廈總領內田，經通知該處外國領事團及租界當局，說日海軍將下令於二十五日晚六時起禁絕鼓島與大陸　　交通。</p>
<p>日×這種非法事件的　見　出，主要目的自然在於恫嚇英法　等民主和平國家，企圖進一步霸佔一切租，刦奪歐美列強全　在華　益，挽救目前侵華戰爭　遭遇的危難。同時我們更可以肺綫的　度還不積極與　定，正因爲少數頑　派領袖　在企圖日本不參加德意軍　同盟而重溫英日同盟的舊夢，正因爲英美法各國對於鼓浪嶼事件及上海租界事件採取手段之軟弱無力。因此。我們可以斷言，倘使民主和平各國對日再不採取有效的制裁。則日×的×行還決不止於今日在海上的所爲。</p>
<p>和平不可分割！任何將遠東不包括在反侵略陣綫的企圖，　只能增加　界的紛　，都只能增加歐洲的危機。因此，蘇聯固將不能接受這種「反侵略」的組織形式。　民族解放與世辦和平而英　抗戰快達兩年的中國也有勝利出來說明，出來警告民主和平各國！</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>事實，事實映上我們的眼上簾，刻我們的腦際：</p>
<p>演劇的，是廢寢忘　地絞盡腦汗；看戲的，是不　跋涉地　着大雨到場。到後台，可以到中救朋友們睡　不够而工作還是那麼緊很。巡視二三樓，可以看到擠得密　的觀衆，是那麼興奮地來　臭苦難的祖國的火藥味，來接受新生的祖國的洗禮。美中不足的是前座的「汽車階級」還不夠十三樓的觀衆那般熱烈。</p>
<p>——這，這就是「中救」昨晚在利舞台公演的烏瞰。</p>
<p>正八時，賑聯會盧國棉，記者公會李建丰二氏先後致詞．對于中救二十個月來馳騁南北戰揚，感動千千萬　軍民之成績多所讀揚，對于此次為賑聯會義演，　欵慰勞傷兵難民，表示謝意。尤其是對于該團團員擺脫養尊處憂的生活，而買献一切于祖國，特別加以讚美。</p>
<p>過國　之後，「民族萬歲」這偉大的國　劇，就配合着精練的藝術，拉開了它的序幕。。</p>
<p>狂風暴雨，雷電交加。以及在掙札中的孤帆，都維妙維肖地，使觀衆。像在眞實景况之中。白魯飾包文信，妻子已經被×人遭蹋了。憤恨和着慌溢於言表。奚落，沒爲勇氣給他援手的人們使他非常失望。金山飾魏大鵬畢竟是個英雄好漢，終於濟人之急，救他渡江。</p>
<p>第一幕第二場話現着×人壓迫我同胞，在東北替他建造兵營的殘酷。金山表現英雄主義，一舉一動，看出非常優美，非常老練。王瑩飾澳奸女兒——韋明，一字一句，却淸脆而有力地打動每個人的心坎。</p>
<p>第三場很迅速地在幕外出現。三個鄉民領袖飲血酒爲　時，那沉痛的「我們大家一條心。　　　　　」—引起了全場熱烈的掌聲。這是你說的話，我說的　，亦是大家要說的話。</p>
<p>第　幕開始　在人　河山的郊野。韋明——王瑩飾——在拒絕漢奸向她求愛的警句；「愛！你以爲我亦醉生夢死　　你以爲你這漢　的生活可以過一輩子嗎？』這是很多人，很多人應該記住的話。</p>
<p>第二幕第二場還是郊外，繁星　燦，活現　黑夜的美麗。三村鄉民正在會議反抗暴×，談到大家都楚從山東逃難到關外來的，　不勝　噓感嘆！各人雖然有各人的表情，對×『一條心』却是連連　「是！是！是！」</p>
<p>劫後的地主像平民一樣起來領島坑戰了—私人過去恩怨却冰釋了—這真是要謝謝日本人。</p>
<p>第三幕第一場是在魏大鵬的家中。柯剛飾魏妻，煞像一個　樸，溫存的農婦。范政飾魏兒，天眞，活潑，這中間，還加上父親敎育兒了獨立的穿插，很有意趣。大　父子英勇地去和×人执命了。</p>
<p>第三幕第二場那被迫向×軍叩頭行禮的侮辱眞使人憤恨。大鵬不爲威屈宜乎博得羣衆的愛戴。×人爲了要處　死刑而强令其射他兒子頭上的　　　　衆揑了一把汗。雖然幸而射中頻果，大家欣然，可是。大膠仍不能逃出×人的虎口。</p>
<p>第四幕在×人威脅之下，飾韋明的王瑩說：「　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　又是鼓起熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>大鵬亦逃出監牢了—他相信　衆的力量了　　　　　　　　，將到末日子—大鵬「哈哈哈……」的笑，苦笑　冷笑，眞是偉大的笑—笑，　住了我們的×人！</p>
<p>末的第五幕，×乒營燒燬了！羣衆的喊聲，山崩地陷！　衆的火把，象徵民族　光明。眞是一憫偉大的場面！雖然還　更大的　迫到强，在統一戰綫團結致之下，終曾獲得最後勝利的！</p>
<p>——在極度興奮中　幕。</p>
<p>這　劇情，演技，併景，燈光………無論那一方面的收穫都是使我們　美呌絕，「中救　　竟是「中救」，舉竟是新生　前進劇團。今晚的「保術祖國」，包括「中　」最熟練的四個著名的短劇，這是他們在藝術上的得意代表作，是千千　萬　民所酷愛的抗戰故事劇，爲了救濟　難，爲了敎育自己，爲了欣質最進步的戲劇藝術，我們要總動員愛國僑胞作爲「中救」的觀衆。</p>

<p>— 陳熹</p>
<p>好容　警報解除了，我止準備赴災區視察的　候，第一次警報又響了。迨×機瘋狂地再在市中心區一帶投彈和偵　後，又折飛入內邊　　方面去，人們才寬　了一口長氣，揑了一把冷汗，叫囂地從避難　下爬了上來。</p>
<p>『吹，糟糕了，這汕頭！』人們互語着。</p>
<p>是的，汕頭，這南國的一個華　的小都市，現在　變成了一個×人最好的屠場，我無可　遏地流下　淚。</p>
<p>雨，霏　地　酒　。</p>
<p>抑　　情感，冒實雨，到今天被災的地方　調　，經　　平路和　中　區小公　，我看見往日×　轟竹的成續，斷瓦　　，歷歷在目。</p>
<p>馬路十行　很多，各人懷了一顆探險的心，到被炸的地方去看看，以期對日，狂　的×性有一個更深　認識。</p>
<p>上午投彈的地方是昇平路那　的市亭（市集）　廣東　　行，招商街一帝，共投十餘彈。廣更省銀行因爲有了防空棚，並不台倒塌，然而，那宏大的建築物却傷痕　片，玻璃掉滿　街上，憶去年×機亦曾來此投彈，舊恨新仇，完全留待我們去洗雪！一個小市亭却炸得狼藉不堪，瓦礫和殘垣積滿了馬路，炸彈投下的　坊却安靜地張着大口，水從坤下面湧出來……</p>
<p>招商街，這里多是民房，×人的炸彈唱找着了　個目　—有一家六人　均遭×人屠殺，新　不久的少婦，還懷着　孕，年靑的姊姊和四歲的弱弟　　這比毫無抵抗的人們，都在×人瘋狂的轟炸下作了　牲。</p>
<p>本山高等法院後面也被中數彈。</p>
<p>我轉身囘來，　至半途，第三次×機又來襲，警報駭人的叫起來後，人們驚慌得失措地，逃起　，灰土捲上半空，混合着細雨，像片霧，像一抹烟，這　大地又在急劃的動　中了　！</p>
<p>×機　是　目標的濫炸，究竟走到什　地力去才會安全呢？」我想着，就在旁邊一家商店　避。在寫面。我總到一些商人們忿怒的詛爲有×人殘酷瘋狂，是的，人們有的是高的價恨與高度　憤怒而已，在情緒上一時也　會陷於零亂愴惶，但意志却是趨堅定了！</p>
<p>×　似乎越來越多，雖然下豐雨，但它們還是悠悠然地翺翔着，洪大的機　　是攪　着全市人民的　緒。侍暴烈的轟炸聲過後，我帶着波動的腦海和剌激的心思，跟着解除警報的餘音。大踏步地向灾區走去。</p>
<p>這次，遭劫的地　是烏橋這些貧民區。</p>
<p>經過同濟馬路，前幾天被炸的房屋更加　碎，泥濘的泥土拌絞着瓦礫，住民很　，景象是異常蕭條和凄凉！</p>
<p>同化礶頭　司被炸得最利害，規模宏大的工廠，現在已是　目疮痍了！</p>
<p>走過一些。就看见蓬片飛滿着天空，空氣也　得很汚濁，帶着血　和火藥味，，能想到這似乎是另外一個世界的地方，今天却被投了五彈　！</p>
<p>受災地帶很廣，洋屋房子倒塌了八九十間。碎　破　正什亂地睛塞着，救護隊員止在奮勇地翻來翻去的搶救着，一個個的屏　被抬出來，這裏有　十幾的老年人，數月的　孩，斷臂殘肢的也有，血枯了的頭　也有，脫離骨肉　　腑也有……我不敢多看幾　未遭　的死者的　屬們正在號啕人哭　幾百個被毀了屋　　未受害的苦　們站在大雨中蒼白　臉向　發　（這是他們唯一的歸宿地　發呆…</p>
<p>我們　這此　廢墟上經進，在瓦礫中我還看見到一隻被彈　截下的手指和一些碎　的骨肉，大堆　血跡，雨水正和它們混拌在一起。在小路邊有一隻死去了的小猪和一隻小狗。它們正和他底主人同樣遭　　腸　　流掛在外面。</p>
<p>我巡視了一週後，心房要　裂開來一樣，情感高漲到最高點，悲哀，憤怒和×愾心！</p>
<p>囘到家裏來，正提起　來要向人類控訴的時候，外　『鳴——鳴——鳴一—』的警報聲又　起來了。</p>
<p>不錯，屠　是　　着，犧牲的同胞是增加　，但終有一天我們要以牙還牙，以眼還眼，××××××××××！</p>

<h3 id="c52">美國電視彩片成功　今年夏天不出門可看電影　售價昂貴暫時怕不普遍 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>繼聲片而後、電影史上的又一革命、無穎、是　視影片（Television）就我們最近所得到的消息、美國的電視影片、將由理論而現實了、這　姑把美國傳來的消息、寫在下面、</p>
<p>（一）開始的年頭</p>
<p>一九二九年、在美國、特食是電視影片眞正開始的年并沒有、特別注重是在「開始」兩字上面、無綫電廣播是在一九二〇年開始的、但到了一九二二年、商用收音機才開始有人裝置、而直到一九二四年，聲音才正常良好、到一九二六年，無綫電牧音機更開始大量製造、而佈成無綫電網、因此、事實上無綫電到了這個時候、才可說真正風行、以後又經過幾度的改進，電視影片也就這樣的自本年開始、而第一步—關於技術、計劃、和　濟諸問題、也就要在本年開始　定、到了夏天他們家裏可以裝置電　影片了、</p>
<p>（二）構造　概略</p>
<p>那麼這種電視影片、將來風行之後、我們所見到的將會怎樣　買　架電視影片機、要費多少錢呢、我們先來一說電視影片的情狀罷、在美國、自前國民和哥侖比亞　大無綫電公司、本年度的確要　　電視影片了、他們所採用的是陰極射綫的Catboed　ray　System根據一種管叫做陰極射　、所發的音是很簡單的、主要的目的是在使人看、但背後、關於電力的配置那是很複雜的、譬如在工程方面、曾有無數人費盡心血、加以研究、一地改良、才有今日的一大，這裏把這方法。簡單的叙述一下、也不無濃厚的興趣、在　極　管中、有一種子的光完全沒有　性的、　成一星光點。射在　的末端、這光　是會繼續不斷的　光和影改變的，向前搖　得很快、而上下的搖動却很慢、這兩運動作、和影綜合之後、可控制造像的光點、我們看到早年時代、研究電視影片者、都曾根據機械方面、確定大的映影機、可放　四百四十條綫的影片、而目前的條綫也就以這個數字爲　準，後來　極射　發明了、在高速率下移動、可比低速率不放大式樣、不增大聲響、並不增加機件的成本，得有進一步的成功、</p>
<p>（三）研究的進步</p>
<p>有了一種方法之後、一般究研電視影片的人、興趣就集中　極射綫的研究上、目前所採用的正是這種、另外、和這種電視影片相對的、還發明了一種威廉潑萊斯的震力傳聲鏡、用一架開麥拉、一種乾片，（很像影的乾片）。裝在極射管上面、這乾片上蓋有無數的感光絀胞、而像就集中這乾片上，一種　極射電子橫跨在這就片上、把影像的綫一條條吸去、而很快的把影傳出來、開麥拉和收影機的動作是完全一致的、同樣的影像　次的送出去和接收到、一方面是直綫的襬動、另一方面是平綫的擺動，用這種方法、影片一定要有四百四十一條綫、才能把影條多次的　　、在傳影的時候、　槽之中、同時更傳出　音來、而在收影的一方、各種符號、一定要　散　放大　、</p>
<p>（四）售價的昂貴</p>
<p>機　的構造旣然這樣複雜、無論是傳影或收影的機噐，當然要比普　的無綫電播音機或收音機成本要省得多、在這種情形之下、影片的尺寸一定要很適當、而一架好的牧影機、所眏出的影片、至少有七寸半　十寸大小、這　就要用巨大的　種射管、但價錢是很貴的、大概每架值美金三百九十元至五百元、假如你一定要出較少的錢，那你就祇能　到較小的三寸乘四寸的影片、而値價大約每架自美金百五十元至二百元、在目前、再要便宜的收影機、大概還買不到、大號的陰極射管、需要强有力的保護物、限定着影片。用高度的電流、不一定有意外的危險、但由自動發火和透熱的機器、可使銀幕上會有一雪花」、而最後　，非要用二百條綫代替四百四十一條綫的影片不可、這便成爲一個電視影片上的重要問題、然而一般的工程師却表示樂觀、以爲這些小問題的處置是很容易的、據說待陰極射綫電影片風行之後、幾年之中、就可解决、</p>

<p>「如果我不能得到仁愛，我可獨自生活。」她驕傲的說。</p>

<p>「我可以敎人。我能敎人家你所敎我的語音學」她也笑着。「我可以去做卡伯帝敎授的助敎」。</p>
<p>驗容轉成白色。「呀！」叫了一聲。</p>

<p>……鬨傳多時的申報杯女子籃球義賽，決定本月廿九日　　始了、刻下疑已入于大戰來臨的前夕、各隊爲了義舉而參戰、均設法加强實力、所以、這幾天來各隊紛紛準備、杯馬厲兵、等侍　那戰神降臨了、</p>
<p>……這次會戰、共有四强參加、計爲中華，知行、西南　華難等、而　隊的實力、各有千秋、將來競爭、正未知鹿死誰手、故在未戰前、值得檢討一下各隊的實力、</p>
<p>知行隊　知行是四强中之勁旅、一班姐兒、　能征　　、而且多　全運的好手、如其前　陳榮　、早已駛名國內、是個多才多藝的女　兒　陳金釵曾在上海代表東亞出席全運、也是　輪先乎、向往芳、孫玉明、乃年　女中旗下的名將、作戰　　、特別豐富、听以　個前鋒綫、　說異常、　　衢洗　　、　　豪、防守異常楨密、任　方如何猛勇、也不易　　地的防綫、林少　乃梅芳的宿將，　守皆官、餘如　齋珍，黃意如、瀾偉　、辜　政、李賣珍、金歡憲、杜　西、劉潔貞、何灼生、梁寶嫻、杜帶　，趙桂頁等、均饒勇善戰、總之、這枝人馬、的是雄師、</p>
<p>中華隊</p>
<p>中華旗下擁有好手多　、戰　力異常充實、像劉守光的過關斬　、英勇無　、而且她　是個全運代表、作戰經　够足、技術超羣、何景雄　息芬的訪衛　　、　爲穩健、等閒不易走過她　的　指關頭　　　貞是華僑的健將　　驚球　裏　頗負聲譽、加以容家姊　御　　征、李純　、　尙英、葉慕自等　鋒陷陣、　有獨到之能、張潤蘭、崔麗、楊瓊等也是憤戰之輩、因而全軍戰　力、　爲雄　、和知行比較、不相上下、故這個光榮銀杯、　　地定爲此　强隊所　　、但他日究是誰家天下、非經决戰後猶未能　斷也</p>
<p>西南隊</p>
<p>西南全軍實力、雖然此不上中華知行兩隊　麼雄厚　、　但前在　　中、已　到其全　作戰精、　　爲飽滿　　　　何浣湘、邱美和、朱　　等、一攻一守、工夫週到，又吳　心、李　　、葉佩頁、伍素貞等、　捷玲　、在在可使對方感受莫人的　　、還有後　的馮眞華，宋　蘭、霍羣英、張惠英　、雖在備員之列、技亦不錯、他日和華　、中　、　行等緣分庭抗　、必有大廝　、而其決非易　的、當無疑義、</p>
<p>華雄隊</p>
<p>華雄、是　　之軍、作戰　絡、　比以上三　稍　、但旗下擁有　淑　、雷　桂、　文素、陳綺霞等、看來實力亦强悍、還有鍾子卿、周端、温零玉、彭　秀、吳文　的五位英雄、都有相當作戰經騐、所以、我　定這枝娘子軍、自有她倆的能力和各隊相週旋。當不　相形見拙的、到他日會師鏖戰之時、其實力如何，便可揭曉了、</p>

<h3 id="c64">日常的健康問題 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>【問】身體非常衰弱、並多生疾病、現在欲保養身　、何種食物旣經濟而且營養素最多？</p>
<p>【答】一般的見解、貴重的食品才有大量的營養素、這是一種錯誤的見解。根據有研究的人的報告、燕窩翅並不如豆腐、　之、我們要供給體內適當的需要、我們身體需要的食物、可分五大種、（一）炭水化合物、（二）脂肪、（三）蛋白質、（四）礦物質、（五）維生素（或稱維他命），此處因限於篇幅、不能多說、現在只舉一兩種日常食品、對身體很　益的而且很合乎經濟的條件、分述如下、</p>
<p>（一）糙米和黑麵、含維他命乙和礦物質、常常食之、能治療脚氣病、並且能促進生長和發育、尤能補血、因爲糙米和黑麵內含有多量的礦物質——銅和鐵、並且很容易吸收、</p>
<p>（二）豆類、豆類的貧品很多、如點心、蔬豆腐、豆漿、實在不勝枚舉、價旣廉而又易購、豆的養份極豐富、含有大量的植物性蛋白質、成份和牛相差無幾、而鐵質且超出牛奶之上、市上售賣的補血特效果、其中主要的成份、多半是鐵質，如其多化費一些錢在補血的藥品上、則不如多吃些豆腐的食品、例如三兩黃豆、可以做兩磅豆漿、這不過僅化費二二分錢的代價、希望保養身體的人們、天天吃些豆類食品才好、</p>
<p>（三）蔬菜、靑綠色的菜蔬、亦含有多量的礦物質、同時又富於各種維生素、而且蔬菜的織維質，不會被腸胄消化、它能淸除我們的腸胃、通暢便秘、有益於健康的、所以什麼人都應當在每餐中多吃些蔬菜、這是件輕而易舉的事、</p>
<p>【問】：病後的身體、覺得非常委弱、欲行一種最輕量的運動、以　早日恢復健康、不知何種運動較宜、</p>
<p>【答】：欲求病體恢復、不僅在運動一方面、除運動之外、如注意飲食、精神　養等、同時加以運動方能爲功、關於輕量的運動、可行戶外或郊野散步、最好在淸晨的時間、除風雨外、宜日日行之、當此風和日暖的春日、步行郊外、旣能吸得新鮮空氣和煦暖日光的照射、叉可從大自然中的欣　、增添心情的快感、山道上和田　間的綠苗黃花，　處都能激發個人的興趣、調節身體的疲勞、每日有數里的步行、心身俱能獲得適宜的調養、希望身體十分孱弱的人們、實際的去試一試、</p>

<p>— 莊瑞源</p>
<p>我坐下來給　遠的地方寫一個「小包裏」。</p>
<p>這兩年以來，從睡眠，吃飯和從休息中我節省了一點一滴的時間，給那懷念着的遠方寫小包裹一樣沉重的信，是習慣了。當然，我追着綠色的　踏車奔跑，從臃防的　袋　得到了速力寄來的小包裏，也是習慣了。</p>
<p>日子彷　像一座寂寞的屋子，在這屋子裏我　住下來，過去了一個秋天，冬日的時間依然不是我自已的，春來，我簡邊害怕了，這平是湯姆期納許的春大，沒有布　爲，沒有陽光下談笑的老婦人，於是我又坐下來，　一個個的字塡滿了我的空白的一分鐘，一秒種，我多麽珍惜著一分古典熱情，一分近代理性，這是爲什麼我不憚麻煩地寫了兩年沉重的小包裏，完全沒有一點疲倦。</p>
<p>日子川流着，今天是昨天的包續，而明大將有更淡的記億，更　的烟，這又是爲甚麽我珍惜地收藏了一封從遠方寄來的信，完全沒有一點疲備。</p>
<p>一切重新從記憶裏開放出來，我懷念上海，我原是在那目由的土地上住慣了的，我應該回到那土地上去，雖然經過了機鬥，經過了燃燒的上海是淪陷了，她在遠麟大陸而去的重洋中，而黑暗的海上是多風暴的，我懷念着　縷中的孤島，於是在困　的夜夢中，跨越了四月的烟霞，飛回上　去。</p>
<p>這巳經是久遠的事了，咬着橡皮精神爽朗地走渦靜安寺路，春天，躺在吳淞海濱的革地上，施施地噴着桃木　斗。這已經是更久遠的事了，我像一隻小蝸牛似地，　　着　頰，　普書包到學校裏去，漸漸地我知道怎樣在校園裏寂寞地效步，黑色　簷笆。紅色的屋頂，白楹樹的葉子展開了綿密的夢，我會爲那碎如小白花的腳步聲喘起氣來，爲　歡的鬢髮和好　的腰校做過經綿的詩。</p>
<p>而在這個　天的下午，上海的郊外該是蔓草掩沒着小徑，布毅為　楚地啁啾鳴著吧；有一點陽光來到的房間中，我想起的却是另外一件事。</p>
<p>在困頓的夜夢裏，跨越了四月的烟霞，飛囘上海去，早晨白色陽光終于來了紙窗外的剪影是多彩的，我甜密地睡眠了又甜密地　來，歸夢像輕淡的煙來了又消失。我　出去在早晨的陽光下呼吸早晨的空氣，我想那不是　邊少女嗎？人家是年少而無愛的。</p>
<p>一天的開始，另外一些寂寞的開始，我仍然孤寂得像一匹北極熊，兀自起坐，兀自行走，到火車站上去散步，我的影子也是孤獨的。我看見機關車咱出黑色的煤烟，便在黑色的煤烟上做起黑角的夢來。我久久地望着靑色天空下火車的黑色而長歡。</p>
<p>前年的炮火使我離開了　浦江，黃浦江邊和半女神的翅翼已點然無光，閘北的軍隊在戒備着第一顆從天銷庵射擊過來的子彈。以後的日子下我只在懷念著囘到黃浦江畔去的一天，而繼續着背離東部的烽火，向遙遠的西南作着長途的跋涉。</p>
<p>現在我　完全地疲倦了，在這安靜的山城中居住下來，偶然我伸手在自已的衣衫上拍一拍灰塵，我要　這是從八個不同的省份帶來的灰塵，我可以說出一百個不兒的城鎭，村莊，說出那所穿過的古道的一切，那是峽谷，那是關隘，多夢湍急的河沭，多麽豁期的沙渚，多麽陰暗的港紋，何處是遠行人登舟的渡頭，又何處不是投宿者叩門的人家。我可以記憶每一次艱辛的行旅。</p>
<p>我完全明白在這險阻而多殺害的時代，無數的血為方寸的土增而流。戰爭的翼謗展開到了與每一個角落。砲火對於一切人的生命是漠不關心的。我們爲著某一些　累背離了東部的烽火是太久太遠了，我們無法撲向了炮火，而是被追逐向遠遠的西南作着長途的跋涉。</p>
<p>儘管我經對過去了的漸漸順得陌生，上海的郊外經過貪溢的燃燒或　孤島，飄浮着，在遠離大陸而去的重洋中。而明天有看比今天更淡的記憶，更　的烟。儘管我讓記憶更輕淡下去。我已經不再悵惘於　去的日子，咬着橡皮糖精神爽朗地定過靜安寺路；春天，躺在吳淞海濱的革地上，施施地噴着桃木烟斗。而且對于忠營的記憶我甚至冷淡了，對於美習的和更美麗的化身也不再有若那麽熱烈的完敎感情。</p>
<p>然而我久久地徘徊在火車站上，我看見機顧車噴出黑色的煙，便在黑色的煤煙上做　黑色的參來。這火車天天裝着多麽擁擠的客人在這　停下又從這裏出發，到一個遙遠的海港去。</p>
<p>所以亦運個春天的下午，有一點陽光來到我的房間中，我想起的是另外一件事：從那遙遠的海港可以到達一個更遙遠的海港，最後，我會從一個圓圓的小意外發現　黃濁的海水，黃浦江依然是那麽黃濁。流着，更是現在，暫時地蒙上了恥辱，是那麼黃濁地恥辱，流出吳淞口，匯合了揚子江。</p>
<p>是的，我懷念着上海，我就要回去了，回去了又離開。這樣我坐下來給遠遠的地方寫一個小包裏，</p>
<p>兩年來。我是那麽習慣地讓一個個的字塡滿了我的空白的一分鐘，一秒鐘現在我却巳經沒這驚人的耐心。我年靑，便不能不有一份手靑人的煩躁，依然在這場戰爭中我　法撲向了炮火，但是我要去探望一些戰爭的區域，探望在五月　陷落的鮮花鮮血的家鄕，最後，我又要看見黃通江上的上海，像一匹受傷的野獸，茫然地茫然地蜷曲黃浦江畔，咬地自巳的尾巴，悲哀着，而要在悲哀中復仇，將近兩年了，</p>
<p>一切　新從記憶裏開數出來。讓明天有着比今天更淡的記憶，更淡的煙吧。我要一步步地走囘上海去，籌記憶重行新鮮，永遠是那麽新鮮地你留着。</p>

<p>在台城給雨水悶住了幾天，　若雨今天還不請，我想，十二個鐘頭是要變成十二天那麽久長的。參而，當我洗驗的時候，太陽巳帶來了晴朗的喜訊。</p>
<p>多天來我時刻地懷念著白沙：我懷念這市鎮，正如懷　着一個病重的摯友一樣。白沙封鎖在　疊的家巒中，從前只消化費三兩個鐘頭的火車，就可以到達了。但而今可不行了，那鐵路巳掘成了無數的深洞，火車頭也多在×機卜撕成了細片了，要去，就只有靠着兩條腿走路。</p>
<p>路程是三十多華里，但行起來會超出這　目的：因爲路上巳密密地築起了無數的小山，我必須從那些新塡的小山上一個一個地翻過去，曲綫不知巳把路程拉長了多少！</p>
<p>沿逮是一座小山，一只池塘（新挖的窟洞塡上雨水），有秩序地間隔着，貼近池塘邊的小路滑溜溜的，一個不愼，就會跌下一丈深的新潭去了，那小山行起來也很難，因爲那高　的　泥，，巳給雨水澆成膠質了，每踏一步，靴了陷　了大半部，提起來時是　費一股氣力的。</p>
<p>幸而行了一半，以後的一半就沒有破壞了，我看着平坦的後半路程，鬆了一口氣，隨使走進一所小買攤的茅屋裏，喝了一杯開水，又抖起了精神邁進。</p>
<p>繞過了一重山，另一重不同面目的山　出來接待，黃昏時刻，我隱隱地望見在山隙閒出現的白沙市的樓頂了，那時，我又歡快，又焦急　　子是　沉沉的，宛如患了熱病，大槪是因爲我許久巳不作長途的步行了吧。</p>
<p>進入白沙市時，我並不感到久別重逢的喜悅，却　了一顆探問故人的病傷時的心淸。</p>
<p>先找到那裏的熟人，叫他帶我到各　探　炸彈的痕跡，哪位朋友剛巧是民大附中的學生，大轟炸時他也在這專實遍了驚險的氣味，</p>
<p>他吿訴我：那血寫的日子是三月三十日。</p>
<p>他又吿我：那天×機來了八架，分五架到赤坎，其餘三架就在這裏循迴轟炸。約莫一個鐘頭的光景，鐵島翹起了尾巴得意地囘去時，這　巳有了一百二十所樓宇變成了敗瓦頹垣，一百五十多個人做了血鬼，二百左右的趁市者負了痛創的　……</p>
<p>他帶了我，從這條街到那條街，在每一個彈痕的旁邊，我都歇息幾分鐘，並拿出日記部來詳細地記錄，當我寫那些記錄的字　時，我的心上彷彿有千百的螞蟻在　噬着，你們無辜的純良的死者喲！曾樣才能寫出我那時爲你們而哀位的沉重心情？</p>
<p>走到海濱海的空地時，我的朋友低聲地對我說：</p>
<p>這位朋友說到這裏時，聲音也有點療啞了，他在回情中受不了這太大的悲感吧</p>
<p>然而我呢，那時却憤怒多於悲悼了，禁不住地說：</p>
<p>『×本人是等於野×，縱使是一個老弱婦人，他們也不惜消耗無數槍彈的！他們到處都是一樣！』</p>
<p>一個多月來，這裏巳經過許多次雨水的沖洗了，但未不能冲洗　這血蹟！這小河嘶嘶不息地！着，但永不能流去人們心裏的那個血寫的記憶：『三月卅日』！</p>
<p>一九三九·五，于台城。</p>

<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>凡人要成功一些大小事業，少不得總要有一些本事。這本事，說起來就是所謂經濟之才，幹才，自修身齊家，以至於治　平天下，那少不了牠。</p>
<p>在這本事之中，却又可以分成兩種：一種是走着官塘大路，一板三眼，規規矩矩踱方步的，所謂于道者是；一種是只問目的，不擇手段，任何槍花都掉得出來，所謂覇道者是。　理，王道是傷來古聖先王所稱頌，所力行，果然應該　施不可，水到渠成的，可是不幸得很，照我看來，這王道，從古以來就沒有實行過，或者說，實行沒就沒有成功了，我們去翻翻歷史，只派見一派霸道。</p>
<p>每一代的「高組」太祖一，創業登基那一個不是從一刀一槍中打出來，或者從謀王篡位中抓得釆的？這不是霸道是什麼？等到一做南面王，果然可以施行仁政，推行王道了，然而我們推究他們，以及他們子孫的心理，又那裏個個是花愛劇愛民呢？，又那一個不是要想保全他們那一份私產江山，所以才不得不借古聖先王的大帽子，來壓他們的老百姓，又假借甚麽聖經賢傳，來提那種君要臣死，不得不死的大道理，使老百姓動彈不得？甚　崇信佑文，甚　興學施敎，無非愚民政策，叫老百姓好好擁護他們，不要暴動，其作用正與焚書坑儒相等。這那裏是甚麼王道？還不仍是覇道！馬上得之是霸道；不能馬上治之，勉强來馬下治之，到底是霸道。</p>
<p>天下國家還是只有霸道，那就怪乎社會家　問，也只有覇道了。換言之，在這些地方，用不著講究甚麽正當的經濟之才，幹才，只要講究些手段，因爲手段本來有兩路，正是覇道的兩面：</p>
<p>一曰辣，操有生殺之權，對于反抗的，不貨，有地皮可刮，狠狠地刮去幾寸，向我乞憐的，探之大門之外：向我求告的，一毛不拔，最好使人吃了你的苦，口裏說不出，或者使人望見你的影子都怕，不得不遠遠地避開你，讓你誰衝直撞，獨往獨來，——凡此，都是手段之辣，足以助成事業者。</p>
<p>實在也難怪手段不能不辣：你想，高尙的一「文章」，還須「辣手」才能『著』得出來，而大恩不報，殺以滅口，也是占今來的常事，更何况一般的事情！那又安得而不辣！</p>
<p>一日詐，自來兵不厭詐，而兵又正是國家大事，是故，詐的勢力，也漫漫於一切「事」裏『業』間，若不是諸葛亮的七擒，縱，運用詐的長處，那又會得「南人不復反矣矣」了我常常聽見老　吿誡子弟，「逢人只說三分話」，可以作爲詐的心傳。</p>
<p>原來在複複的社會中，也許可以說，在文明的人羣裏，老實人，一本正經者，無往而不負有「壽頭」之名，弄得一敗塗地，倒是手段高强，鎗花會使得人眼花擦亂者，却如向陽花木到處逢春，於是辦事的方法，最好者是紮了圈套由人自願鑽人或跌入，如你之豐，切不可實對人說，我所求於他的，不過是某種某種目的，懇請他的幫忙。</p>
<p>一個人的手段善於辣的，可以成功，善於弄詐的尤可以成功，假便辣與詐樂善，那就天下去得，無往不利了，</p>
<p>我自己想想，究竟不是偏激之說：講王道的孔子，他的一生是甚麽呢？甚至講霸道，沂於王道的霸道的孟子，他的一生又是甚麽呢？而劉邦趙匡胤，朱元璋之流，又那一個　講孟子之書的？再說，講大道　耶穌，他的結果是甚　呢？而希特勒墨索里尼之徒，又那一個是眞正熱心的基督徒？所以我說，王道，本來就沒有這麼一會事；人以霸道來，我以覇道去，至少在現在，才是眞正的天經地義！</p>
<p>「天下本無事，庸人自擾之」，這是霸道，用辣與詐的手段的關係，無奈天下個個都是庸人，只好用手段也就只好蘇其自擾之了，自擾之也者，原來是惟一的人生。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Our Country's Minimum Demands <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On the 22nd of this month, our country's representative, Gu Weijun, presented two demands to the League of Nations Administrative Council: first, to notify member states to expand their financial and material assistance to China and to cease supplying Japan with war materials and raw materials; and second, to organize a group to jointly promote various measures. These demands are, in fact, the minimum we can ask for today, after 22 months of arduous struggle to uphold world peace and justice. We are not only sacrificing ourselves for the sake of our nation's independence and survival, but we are also serving as the vanguard in defending the anti-aggression front, and at the same time, we are the guardians of the Far Eastern interests of the European and American democratic countries. As Representative Gu said: 'If China had already succumbed to Japanese threats or ceased resisting Japanese aggression, allowing Japan to monopolize the Far East, the impact on the interests of democratic countries in the Far East and on the current tense situation in Europe would be obvious even to those without wisdom.'</p>
<p>The first of Representative Gu's demands includes four detailed items: (1) Member states should expand their financial and material assistance to China to strengthen China's ability to resist aggression and to assist refugee relief efforts; (2) avoid all actions that could weaken China's resistance to aggression; (3) cease supplying Japan with war materials and raw materials, especially aircraft and gasoline, to prevent further fueling its aggressive flames; and (4) restrict the import of Japanese goods. The majority of the content of this demand can be implemented very conveniently and effectively by the member states. Financial and material assistance is an appropriate outlet in countries with excess capital and abundant production. With China's debt credit still solid today, all countries can boldly extend loans. Although no specific facts were cited regarding actions that weaken China's resistance, if we were to cite an example, it would be that the international publicity of China's heroic resistance and the exposure of _______________ are sometimes met with suppression or even oppression by some countries or local governments. These are facts that all countries should urgently avoid, and which are very easy to implement. Stopping the supply of war materials and raw materials to Japan, at a time when Japan's finances are on the verge of collapse, is an extremely dangerous matter. I recall that the United States government once warned manufacturers and traders not to casually extend credit to Japan. People from all countries should still remember this clearly! As for restricting the import of Japanese goods, this is a very beneficial measure for countries whose commodity markets are being seized by Japan, especially the eastern territories of Great Britain. It is easy for member states to implement these conditions, and the benefits are very great.</p>
<p>The implementation of the above-mentioned various demands requires appropriate subjects and methods. Therefore, Representative Gu also proposed the formation of a group, which is similar to the 52-nation committee that the League of Nations established when it sanctioned Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, with the aim of promoting cooperation and joint efforts. Individual actions often become lax, so this group is very important. The establishment of such a subcommittee is also necessary to implement Article 16 of the Covenant. Unfortunately, Britain and France only recognize the principle of joint action and, using the excuse that the European crisis has not been completely resolved, say that the basic elements for this joint action are not yet in place. The views of Britain and France are very mechanical. They believe that the resolution of the Far East issue must wait until the European crisis is completely resolved, but they do not realize that world issues are whole and indivisible, and that the China issue is even more closely related to the European issue. If China were to surrender to Japan early, Britain, the United States, and France would not only completely lose their interests in China, but their eastern territories would also be in danger, and Britain and France's position in Europe would be further threatened. Japan's accomplices, Germany and Italy, would intensify their encroachment on Britain and France. The League of Nations, under the control of Britain and France, cannot merely reiterate its previous recommendations regarding our country's demands. We hope to have more concrete joint measures to meet our minimum requirements.</p>

<p>Things on the car. As much as possible, carry it away; the rest is handed over to the people to burn.</p>
<p>Soon, Company Commander Wang was inlaid with gold teeth, and the story spread throughout the camp, so "Three Gold Teeth" replaced his name.</p>
<p>Two, Shooting Friends</p>
<p>A certain route army was trapped in a village, and mass work was just beginning.</p>
<p>One day, gunfire rang out from the surrounding villages, and like a ladder of sieges slowly approaching ________. The officer in charge gave the order! Withdraw from the village and prepare for battle.</p>

<p>"Ah"! The commander opened his eyes wide, "Then I have to reissue them to you."</p>
<p>The box was taken down, carried back boldly, and the representative led the original ________ motionless to the ________ route army. In the middle of the night, the team of farmers walked like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>Once or twice, it was the same. The yeast of ________ route army's political work was bubbling. "Awakening" was like a raging fire ________ burning the farmers inside the puppet organization. They thought that it was strange to deal with even beasts like this, so they decided to simply pull them over – to resist Japan.</p>
<p>The representative came again and agreed on a day to invite the battalion commander to reorganize the army.</p>
<p>One day, the battalion commander took a small number of troops to guard against emergencies, and brought more ________ horses and carts, preparing to handle the handover ________ to collect Qinxi.</p>

<p>In the evening, the battalion commander negotiated with the other party:</p>
<p>"What to do ________? Change the day ________!" said the leader of the pseudo-organization.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Damn it! He, he's really cunning. They promised me a thousand bags of flour, hundreds of thousands of bullets, and horses. Damn it, they changed the date again, and they haven't handed them over yet."</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter, as long as the brothers are willing to reorganize."</p>
<p>"That's ________ done, we're embarrassed if we can't take things away."</p>

<p>Walking according to the designated route ________, there should be no problem. One day, two days, near the Zhengtai Road, entering ________, be vigilant ________, but those who are trained to walk are a little careless.</p>

<p>They were walking next to the valley, facing ________ the high mountains, and the village houses lived on the hillside. As they were walking, a villager ran over and grabbed Li Jun's left arm, looking around. He did not find the symbol of "________ Route" ________.</p>
<p>"Sir, are you from the ________ route army?"</p>
<p>Li Jun took out the "________ Route" from ________. He understood that this symbol would help him solve many problems in front of the people.</p>
<p>"You can't go ahead, more than two hundred cavalrymen just passed by – come! Come! ________ I'll turn you around!"</p>
<p>The horse was turned around by him, no! There was no way, the words of the people should always be believed, and he had to follow him.</p>
<p>The sun went down, and it was already night. Without needing to refuse, he was led to his house by the farmer – a village close to the railway.</p>
<p>Hearing that the ________ route army had come, the old man, the children, ________ came out and busily entertained them. They ate dinner and settled down safely.</p>
<p>The next day, the old man did not let them leave.</p>
<p>"Sir, the road hasn't been explored yet, don't panic!"</p>
<p>Nothing to do during the day, crawling on the ________ head to steal the railway. A train ________ snail crawled over, with not many military vehicles and two locomotives hanging.</p>
<p>"Old sir, why two locomotives?"</p>
<p>"Shh! ________ You'll know in a while, I'm afraid of the endless bombing of the railway these days. I don't know when, the guerrillas will bury bombs under the tracks. The fire Dong Kuatong Kua is walking properly. If you don't prevent it, there will be a loud bang – terrible! Really terrible! – ________ These ________ two locomotives, the one in front pulls backwards after the explosion, the one in the back pulls forward after the explosion, and the two in the middle pull from both ends, hehe... It's quite good-looking!"</p>
<p>"That's right! ________ They can figure it out!"</p>
<p>"We've learned a lot," said the old man.</p>
<p>It was night again, and the young farmer came back and said: "The road is clear, there's no problem," so the people carried their light equipment again, and the horse carried the luggage again.</p>
<p>Knowing the trouble of mobilizing the people, ________ they automatically mobilized all the farmers in the village. They released ________ more than ten ________, and the whole village was worried about escorting these strangers.</p>
<p>The biting cold wind flowed in the wilderness, and everyone's footsteps came together. The old man, fifty or sixty years old, with a long beard, offered tea ________:</p>
<p>"Sir, drink it, we have boiled water ready for you here."</p>
<p>The travelers were moved to tears, but the political commissar's eloquent mouth didn't know how to express himself at this time.</p>
<p>"Old folks. You are so good."</p>
<p>"Sir, you don't know, day and night, we are looking forward to you coming to fight."</p>
<p>Walking. Walking. ________ It was dawn in the east. At the time of parting, the old man pointed out the village road over and over again, and repeatedly warned, before he was willing to go back.</p>
<p>In the slightly white morning light, the cloth signs of the "Good Citizen Certificate" issued by the invaders were seen on the lapels of each of their clothes.</p>
<p>How can the crazy aggression of the Fascists know that the soul of the Chinese nation is forever buried in the hearts of the people of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Four, Children Catch Spies</p>
<p>After breakfast, the farmers walked out of the round cave-like village gate in ________, leading their cattle and carrying plows and rakes. The people in the guerrilla base area were still working as ________ as usual.</p>
<p>Few people were at home, only two children in their teens were ________ outside the village gate at the intersection, throwing stones ________ and scolding each other.</p>
<p>"You, you ××! Why didn't you go to Donggou yesterday ________?"</p>
<p>"×Your mother: My uncle asked me to release half a barn of cattle yesterday!"</p>
<p>Two soldiers walked along the road, one with a rifle on his back and the other with a big knife ________ in a leather sheath. They hesitated in front of the village ________, and asked:</p>
<p>"Little kids, is there any "________ Route" inside?"</p>
<p>"No." The two soldiers walked in, their arms not wearing armbands with the "________ Route" badge.</p>
<p>The two children became suspicious, their small faces froze, and their four small eyes stared blankly.</p>
<p>"Damn, follow ________ him," said the older one.</p>
<p>"Go"!</p>
<p>"The two soldiers walked into a restaurant, sat under the tea shed, smoked, and asked for boiled water. They looked a little embarrassed ________ and exhausted."</p>
<p>The two children circled around, four eyes, squeezing ________ to buy, conveying thoughts, and looked at the two soldiers all over, without any symbols of the ________ route army, and their tone of speech and "________ route" were not consistent.</p>
<p>The two children found gaps from the dry lips, yellow faces, and black teeth of the two soldiers.</p>
<p>At this time, after a soldier chatted with the restaurant owner, he took his gun, bomb, and the two of them went to the back room.</p>
<p>The two children, from the two soldiers' dry lips, yellow faces, and black teeth ________, found the gap.</p>
<p>At this time, after a soldier and the restaurant owner were muttering something, carrying guns and bombs, the two of them went to the back room.</p>
<p>The soldiers unloaded their guns, bombs, and big knives ________ on the kang in the back room of the restaurant. The bright big opium lamp, the ________ copper-colored opium bubbles next to the lamp, the world of clouds and fog, forgot everything.</p>
<p>The two children smiled and turned back again, followed by red tassel spears, earthen cannons, and big knives at the street entrance.</p>
<p>Inside the restaurant was the hissing ________ of smoking, and outside was the chattering discussion. ________ The momentum became more and more tense.</p>
<p>"Damn, they're either deserters or traitors"! Deciding that these two soldiers were not good guys, they still asked the two children to strike first.</p>
<p>The two ________ children quarreled, scolded, fought, and rolled into the back room of the restaurant. It was common for two children to fight, and those who were enjoying their smoke certainly wouldn't care.</p>
<p>Who knew that the two children, with quick hands and eyes, grabbed the gun and knife, and the two ________ took out the bombs and ran out, at this time the men holding ________ red tassel spears and big knives outside shouted ________ the clouds.</p>
<p>"Tie them up!"</p>
<p>"Drag them out and search them!"</p>
<p>There was no judge and no court, so everyone ________ on the big ________ asked you one sentence and me another in public trial, and the detailed ________ result: knowing that they were fake ________ route army, sent to spy on the ________ reality here, and were preparing to launch a large encirclement attack on the Chinese army.</p>
<p>The invaders were dreaming, and the ignorant traitors came to die in vain. Two earthen mounds were added ________ ________ outside the round ________ village gate, and the fresh yellow soil was stained with dark red blood.</p>
<p>When the setting sun fell on the evening ________, a large group of people led their cattle and carried rakes from the fields. They still walked into the round cave-like village gate like flowing water.</p>
<p>The two little ________ were still playing there, telling the passers-by about today's story.</p>
<p>Five, Carrying Bombs into the City</p>
<p>Sun, Li, and Zhang, three warriors, dressed in civilian clothes, carrying bombs, went into the city to buy things.</p>
<p>The usual practice: the aggressor's soldiers could speak a little Chinese, so there was no way to interrogate the people. Therefore, people entering the city, walking to a place thirty steps away from the sentry post at the city gate, only needed to take off their hats and bow to show they were good citizens, and they could enter without ________.</p>
<p>On this day, the three warriors did as usual, but unexpectedly, they encountered an unfortunate difficulty. Two soldiers ________ stopped them. They looked them up and down and insisted on searching them.</p>
<p>"Insist on searching?" The three warriors were a little unwilling in their hearts.</p>
<p>"Damn, how can we ________ break through the search with a bomb in our arms? We might as well just move!" They made up their minds in their hearts ________.</p>
<p>With a "bang", a ________ bomb exploded in the middle of those two soldiers, like two doors opening, and two corpses fell facing each other.</p>
<p>Since the bomb had exploded, there was no way to run away from ________, so they might as well take the opportunity to rush into the city. So they climbed up the city tower and aimed at the aggressor's residence, bombarding it fiercely and killing a few more, and seizing several guns.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Under the Threat of Cannon Fire From a × Warship, a French Mail Steamer Was Searched. Two Foreign Vessels Were Intercepted Within Half a Day. The French Authorities Have Decided to Lodge a Strong Protest. <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Shanghai, 25th] It has been learned that the Commander of the French Asian Fleet, Mr. Bao Ke, intends to proceed to Shanghai on the French vessel "Ya Mei," to investigate the details of the search of the ship by a Japanese warship and then lodge a protest with the Japanese side, it is said.</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 25th] According to sources from the French side here, the French vessel "Aramis" was ordered to stop sailing by a Japanese destroyer yesterday while en route to Shanghai, about 100 miles outside Hong Kong. Japanese sailors boarded the vessel and searched it for an hour. Although the French ship protested, the Japanese Navy meticulously checked all documents. It is reported that the French authorities will lodge a strong protest regarding this matter and have telegraphed the detailed situation to the government in Paris. The "Aramis" is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The British mail steamer "Ranpura" was threatened by cannon fire from a × warship near Hung Hom at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, and forcibly ordered to stop sailing. Sailors were sent to board and search the vessel. Fortunately, a British warship rushed to the rescue, and it arrived safely in Hong Kong. Several hours after the incident, the "Aramis" was stopped from proceeding in the same manner by a × warship just outside the harbor while en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and officers and soldiers were sent to board and search the vessel, causing great disturbance. The × warship knew it was a British and French mail steamer, but still forcibly harassed it, disregarding international law, infringing upon the rights of neutral countries. Its outrageous behavior is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Aramis Was Searched Again</p>
<p>It is reported that the French mail steamer "Aramis," with a capacity of 15,500 tons, which regularly travels between Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe, Japan, departed from Hong Kong yesterday (24th) at noon and set sail for Shanghai. About half an hour after departure, it encountered a × destroyer, which stopped its progress. Subsequently, three officers and two soldiers boarded the vessel via a motorboat. They forcibly demanded the ship's papers and logbook from the captain and inspected them before releasing the vessel. The "Aramis" has a square funnel painted in milky white, and the ship's surface and hull are painted with the prominent French national emblem. It is obvious that it is a French merchant ship. However, the × military officers who boarded the vessel were extremely absurd and asked a series of unreasonable questions, such as "Where did you come from?" "Where are you going?" "Passenger list," and "Cargo manifest," creating a long and pointless disturbance that lasted for an hour before they left. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Hong Kong at noon on the 24th and arrive in Shanghai around the 25th, but the voyage was delayed due to the harassment by the × warship.</p>
<p>France Will Lodge a Strong Protest</p>
<p>Regarding the harassment of the ship by the × warship, the news received in Hong Kong states that the ship departed at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, carrying 80 first-class passengers and 200 other passengers, a total of 280 people. Immediately after leaving the harbor, it encountered a × destroyer, which hoisted a warning flag and forced it to stop, firing a blank shot as a warning to the ship. The method of stopping it was the same as that used against the "Ranpura." After the incident, the ship's captain immediately telegraphed to Admiral Tillolles, the Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Fleet stationed in Xiamen. As the location of the incident was too far away, no French warship was sent to assist. In addition to telegraphing Commander Tillolles, the captain also telegraphed the British and French naval authorities in Xiamen to report everything, but did not request assistance. It is believed that as a result of this incident, the Commander of the French Far East Fleet will lodge a strong protest with Kondo, the × Chief stationed in Xiamen, nearby. At the same time, the French ambassador in Tokyo will also negotiate with the × government. Yesterday, the French Consul General in Hong Kong, Mr. Lidu, told reporters that as of yesterday morning, the information received indicated that the "Aramis" had been stopped and searched by a × warship outside Hong Kong. The information obtained was very brief. As for whether to report the matter to the French government for negotiation, it would depend on receiving a detailed report, he said.</p>

Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that he also found the matter extremely unsatisfactory and that there was still no news of the ship's release.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 24th] When the House of Commons was in session this afternoon, Conservative Member of Parliament Mr. Milner inquired whether the British government had taken measures to prevent further interference with British shipping after 2,000 fresh pigs were seized by five Japanese armed motorboats in the New Harbor of China on April 2 while they were being transported by sampans to the British ships "Whangpoo" and "Cuxhaven." Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately provided a written response stating that Foreign Secretary Halifax was unaware of the incident mentioned by Mr. Milner, but that he had received reports on several occasions that British commercial shipping was being interfered with in the San-tiao-chou area of the Yangtze River, and that the situation was intensifying. Therefore, he had lodged representations with the Japanese government.</p>

He said that although China might have to undergo another two years before it can achieve victory, the current war situation has made important developments: (1) China is determined to continue the war of resistance and resist aggression, (2) China is now in a dominant position, launching attacks on the Japanese army on a front line 2,000 miles long, (3) Chinese guerrillas are extremely active, and the difficulties of the Japanese army are increasing, and will eventually lead to collapse.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] According to the "Kokumin Shimbun," a newspaper published here, it has been reliably learned that among the conditions for the military alliance being negotiated by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, there is a secret clause to include the Far East in the alliance. The three countries will actively assist Chiang Kai-shek in terms of military supplies and send volunteer troops to China to participate in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war. Judging from the repeated attacks by Outer Mongolian troops on the border of Manchuria, the actions taken by Britain and France in Gulangyu and Shanghai, and the dispatch of French military advisors to Chongqing, it can be seen that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are indeed planning joint action.</p>

<p>— Fan Shizhi</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Battalion Commander Wu saw from the tree that the × army had bypassed the mound and was heading north. He pointed his hand to the south, and the two brothers began to guard to the south. Indeed, the × soldiers came in formation. When they entered the range of my rifle, the two soldiers divided to the left and right and continuously shot at the × soldiers. The × soldiers were caught off guard, and five or six of them immediately fell. Not knowing my true strength, they hurriedly formed a horizontal line, scattered, and fired at me. I suddenly ignored the × soldiers firing and after a few minutes, they detoured behind the mountain, attempting to flank my rear. Battalion Commander Wu saw clearly from the tree, so he pointed his hand to the north, and the two brothers immediately began to advance, guarding to the north. As expected, the × soldiers attacked from north to south. After I returned fire, the × soldiers failed again. After doing this two or three times, a certain company of mine heard the sound of gunfire and rushed to the scene, surrounding the × soldiers. The encirclement gradually narrowed, and as a result, the entire × soldiers were annihilated by me.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Wu was not flustered, and jumped down from the tree, examining his clothes. A bullet had passed through his right abdomen, leaving a large hole in his coat, and another bullet had exited from between his legs, with two bullet holes in his crotch. Fortunately, he was not injured.</p>
<p>(4) Bloody Battle of Liancheng Bridge</p>
<p>On the night of April 24, the × soldiers launched a full-scale attack on Liancheng Bridge, two miles northeast of Gaoan, and the situation was precarious. A certain acting division commander ordered Zhu Shouying's troops to automatically cut off Liancheng Bridge and fight with their backs to the river, turning the overall situation from danger to safety. On the 25th, the acting division commander transferred the officers and soldiers of the battalion to the second line for reorganization and rest due to their outstanding meritorious service. On that day, the reporter happened to accompany the division commander to the front line for inspection. At Longwangchao, three miles northwest of Gaoan, he encountered the soldiers of the battalion, who had just been transferred from the front. They were covered in yellow mud and their faces were indistinguishable. Most of them had only twenty or so bullets left, and some had none. It was known that one part of the battalion had not eaten for two days because they had not been able to contact the rear. The acting commander asked them, "The officers were unable to send the food up because they could not contact you, are you feeling bitter? What are your thoughts?"</p>
<p>A squad leader replied, "Revolutionary soldiers are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, and not afraid of hunger. The × people are more bitter than us, they also have no food to eat."</p>
<p>Another private soldier continued, "Because we defended our position to the death, we have food to eat now. And the × people have not had anyone to relieve them, so they still have no food to eat." After saying that, everyone's faces showed a victorious smile. The acting division commander continued to ask, "Last night, more than 120 officers and soldiers below the battalion commander were poisoned, and the position was once shaken. Later, after you destroyed the bridge yourself, you swore to defend it to the death, fighting with your backs to the river. Were you afraid at that time? Did you want to run to the back?"</p>
<p>Their unanimous answer was, "No fear!" Another platoon leader said even more eloquently, "Not only were we not afraid, but we also gave the × people a very thorough assault last night. It was just because it was dark and rainy that our platoon could not contact the company and battalion headquarters that night, but we were not afraid in our hearts, because the Japanese were even less familiar with the terrain than we were, and we could not contact anyone at night. If we ran to the back, the troops behind would only think we were × people, and we would probably be shot to death by mistake at night. At the same time, the officers would not allow us to run to the back either. So we defended there to the death. Until 2:00 AM this morning, our platoon was able to sleep in a Guandi Temple on a hillside."</p>
<p>At this point, the acting division commander turned to the reporter and said, "With these good soldiers, China will never be destroyed! And no country can destroy it! If the war of resistance has reached today, and there are still some defeatists or pessimists among the people in the rear who are living in luxury, it is best to invite them to organize an observation group to inspect the front line, and I guarantee that they will automatically negate their past views."</p>
<p>(5) Father and Son Avenge</p>
<p>Company Commander Zhu, who is over fifty years old, is a veteran general. He is from Zhengyang, Henan, and started as a soldier. He accumulated merits and rose to company commander.</p>
<p>On April 25, he was ordered to attack the Baishi Ridge in Jiuhua, northeast of Gaoan. Here, the × soldiers had built three layers of barbed wire, with fortifications to the northeast and south, and fewer to the west. Company Commander Zhu led the entire company to attack from the west to the east. When the attack advanced to the first barbed wire fence, the entire company had sacrificed, leaving only more than 30 people. Because the infantry did not have tools to break through the barbed wire, the attack was stalled. At the same time, because it was close to the × soldiers, it was not possible to retreat midway. As a result, they used gun butts, mattocks, and other tools to break through part of the barbed wire with great difficulty. Climbing into the second barbed wire fence, the distance between the × soldiers and I was within the throwing range of hand grenades. Because the × soldiers had fewer firepower to the west and there was no cover, Company Commander Zhu threw a hand grenade with one hand. The grenade hit the target, killing more than ten × soldiers. The remaining × soldiers abandoned their guns and fled in panic. Company Commander Zhu then launched a full-scale attack, but was blocked by the third barbed wire fence of the × soldiers. Although I also killed twenty or thirty × soldiers, I could not withstand the fact that all the machine guns in the north and south strongholds of the × soldiers were activated, and the company was completely martyred, and the bodies could not be retrieved. Company Commander Zhu had a son who was a clerk in the regimental headquarters. When the news reached the regimental headquarters at 2:00 PM, and then to the ears of his son, it was like a bolt from the blue. He was so heartbroken that he decided to ask the regimental commander to allocate some soldiers to be under his command to retrieve his father's body. The regimental commander praised his filial piety and agreed to send soldiers to sneak in with him at night. If they went during the day, he was afraid that it would be in vain. The clerk Zhu agreed to this point and waited patiently.</p>
<p>When dusk fell and people were quiet, the regimental commander sent six scouts to accompany the clerk to search for his father's body. They did not return until the morning of the 26th, and no news about them was obtained. At 4:00 PM on the 26th, Baishi Ridge was occupied by the regimental headquarters. The report said that when our army cleared the battlefield, they found the screen of clerk Zhu next to his father's body, less than five steps away.</p>
<p>A certain division commander praised him for his loyalty and specially buried the remains of the father and son at the original location of the screen on Baishi Ridge, and erected a sign that said "Tomb of Two Loyalists."</p>
<p>(6) Wang, the Battalion Commander Who Performed His Duty Despite Illness</p>
<p>Since the 22nd, the city of Gaoan had been surrounded by us like a barrel. Because of the shortage of heavy weapons, the city could not be captured. Although the × soldiers in the city were panicking, they were still resisting and waiting for reinforcements. In order to reduce losses, I sent Wang Kechong, a company commander who was proficient in Japanese (at that time, Company Commander Wang was still ill), to write a letter of persuasion to surrender. According to the military etiquette, if one country sends a military envoy carrying a white flag to another country, it has the responsibility to protect it, and should not shoot him. As a result, the squad leader was shot dead by the × soldiers halfway. Upon hearing this, Company Commander Wang disregarded everything and volunteered to go despite his illness. At the time, he thought to himself that the letter was not thorough enough. If he went himself, he could talk to them face to face and persuade them, wouldn't that be better? How could he know that the "Imperial Army," which claimed to be a civilized country and "officially promoted Wang Hua" (cultural influence), would disregard international law and the regulations that soldiers should abide by, and shoot him? Company Commander Wang was gloriously injured again under such circumstances.</p>
<p>From then on, every brother in the troops experienced a bloody lesson, and had a deeper understanding of the × soldiers.</p>
<p>(7) Keep It as a Souvenir</p>
<p>On the way from Xiangfu Temple to Gaoan, we passed through Qianjin Village. Because the weather was too hot, even though it was only the sun of May, it was very uncomfortable to be exposed to the sun. So I bought a pot of tea in front of a tea house in Qianjin Village and sat down to quench my thirst.</p>
<p>Sitting at the table next to the reporter were two brothers, veteran soldiers who had recovered from their injuries and returned to the front. They were talking endlessly about their heroic battles.</p>
<p>There were many long benches arranged in the tea house, and five or six stretchers were placed on the benches. Lying on the stretchers were wounded soldiers, all newly sent down from the front line. One of the wounded soldiers was seriously injured and groaned particularly miserably. A comrade named Wang Tie, who was sitting next to the reporter, could not bear it any longer and could not help but stand up and shout loudly, "Comrade, how many bullets did you get hit by?"</p>
<p>"Ah... oh... I... I got hit by three bullets!" The comrade on the stretcher replied, enduring the pain.</p>
<p>With this answer, no one expected Comrade Wang to get angry, "You bastard, you're really a coward!" (The reporter notes that "coward" is a Yunnan dialect. It is used to scold someone who is useless.) "Look, I got hit by eleven bullets!" As he spoke, he rolled up his trousers and took off his shirt, revealing a burly and strong body with no less than twelve bullet wounds of various sizes on his legs, chest, and arms.</p>
<p>Comrade Wang counted his honorable bullet wounds as he spoke, as if he was giving a public lecture to the reporter and the wounded soldiers: "A person who doesn't cry out in pain when he gets injured is a true hero. The last time I was hit by twelve bullets, I still struggled to take down the gun, and I never cried out in pain, because the more you cry out in pain, the more it hurts, and it may affect the other comrades."</p>
<p>After Comrade Wang's persuasion, the wounded comrade on the stretcher really stopped moaning. At this time, Comrade Wang pressed down on his left thigh muscle with both hands, and a hard lump of a bullet immediately protruded in the middle. Comrade Wang pointed to it and said, "There is still a bullet that has not been taken out!" He smiled slightly as he said that.</p>
<p>At this time, the reporter could not stand by idly any longer, so he interrupted and asked him, "Why don't you take it out?"</p>
<p>Comrade Wang's answer was beyond our imagination. He smiled slightly and answered the reporter in a very relaxed tone: "The doctor said, 'It doesn't matter if this bullet is not taken out.' So I decided to keep it as a permanent souvenir, a permanent souvenir of my participation in this war of resistance." (Central News Agency)</p>

Although some points still need clarification, I anticipate they will not cause any major difficulties." Subsequently, Attlee asked, "Before the House adjourns for the Whitsun recess, can the government provide a more complete and accurate report?" Chamberlain replied, "If possible, such a report will be made. I have already mentioned that some points still need clarification, so I believe we must wait a little longer. I hope that the next report will provide a full account of the agreement, and I am confident that the agreement can be completed then." This response aroused commotion among opposition members. Labor MP Dalton stated, "Given the urgent crisis in the international situation, we should not delay in organizing a peace front." Chamberlain did not respond to this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Following Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the progress of British-Soviet negotiations, it has been learned from Reuters' diplomatic correspondent that Britain will soon send a reply to the Soviet Union, accepting the Soviet Union's basic proposal, namely, the conclusion of a mutual assistance alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Under the provisions of this alliance, if any allied nation provides assistance to a country that has been invaded, the other contracting nations must immediately come to its aid. The minor issues that Chamberlain mentioned as still needing resolution will likely be addressed by Halifax and Soviet Ambassador Maisky after Maisky returns to London from Geneva. However, it is believed that these minor issues will not hinder the conclusion of a British-Soviet agreement, and are merely matters of adjusting the wording of the agreement.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] The British Cabinet has announced its decision to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. A British government spokesperson stated that the Foreign Secretary hopes to instruct the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union to propose to the Soviet Foreign Minister within 24 hours the conclusion of a full mutual assistance agreement, expanding the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty of 1936 into a three-nation alliance. It is reported that the British Cabinet has agreed to stipulate that if any of the three nations is attacked, the other two nations should immediately provide assistance.</p>
<p>Britain to Present New Proposal to Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently consulted with representatives from France and the Soviet Union in Paris and Geneva to conclude a three-nation agreement. Subsequently, a new British proposal was drafted, approved by the recent Cabinet meeting, and presented to the Soviet Union. Regarding whether the Soviet Union will accept it, official circles here have made many speculations. For example, according to a diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Herald," someone close to the Soviet delegation in Geneva has suggested that the Soviet Union will not accept the new British proposal.</p>
<p>In fact, it is difficult to be certain whether the two countries can fully agree on the principle of mutual assistance. Furthermore, it is believed here that there is a distinction between aggression against any of the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and aggression against any of Germany's neighbors. In the former case, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will immediately take military action. In the latter case, although the three countries have provisions for joint action, the scope and method of assistance still depend on prior consultation between the three countries. Moreover, the British-French-Soviet agreement must take into account the guarantees that Britain and France have provided to Poland, Romania, and Greece. The position of Turkey must not be forgotten either. It is reported that Britain and France have been engaged in extensive negotiations with Poland and Romania in the past few days, but the results are not yet known. The new British proposal is still being drafted. Before the proposal is communicated to Moscow, the British government will first discuss it with Soviet Ambassador Maisky. Maisky is expected to return to London around Friday or Saturday of this week. If the principles of the new proposal are accepted by Moscow, negotiations on all matters of principle will begin immediately. Furthermore, it is said that the phrase "aggression..." still needs to be resolved regarding how to interpret it. However, the British government is determined to reserve the right to interpret it, no matter what, and the establishment of an agreement in the future must be based on this reservation.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] London's morning newspapers published this Thursday feel that the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet agreement guarantees that Britain has a positive attitude of agreement toward the Soviet Union's counter-proposal. However, some political figures still believe that before the agreement is concluded, certain details still need to be resolved, and the content of these details is not comparable to ordinary matters. Therefore, the "Daily Express" predicts that the formal signing of the agreement will occur in no less than ten days.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] According to this morning's "Daily Telegraph," an editorial stated that the impact of concluding a British-Soviet agreement is still somewhat lacking. Currently, there are still some obstacles that have not been overcome, and their nature is not entirely political. Moscow and London have different "temperaments," and their perspectives are also vastly different. The author of the editorial also condemned the Soviet authorities, saying that they are to blame for any misunderstandings. The suspicions and misunderstandings in the negotiations are also due to the Soviet authorities' "policy of standing apart."</p>
<h3 id="e15">Rumor: Italy to Abolish Anglo-Italian Agreement; Believes Anglo-Turkish Agreement Conflicts with It; Plans to Act Freely in Mediterranean <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 24th] Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome this morning from Salzburg and reported to Prime Minister Mussolini on the talks with German authorities. Some in political circles here are now claiming that after Germany and Italy signed a political and military agreement, it is possible that Italy will abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement (established on April 16, 1938). There are two arguments: (1) The establishment of an agreement between Britain and Turkey has changed the Mediterranean situation, which conflicts with the clause in the Anglo-Italian Agreement stating that the Mediterranean should maintain its current status. (2) The German volunteers within Spain have decided to withdraw completely before the 30th of this month, which shows that Italy has indeed complied with the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Conversely, Britain has pursued a policy of containment against Germany and Italy. Therefore, Italy must remove the constraints of the Anglo-Italian Agreement and restore its freedom of action. In other words, it must strengthen defenses in the Dodecanese Islands in the Mediterranean and increase troop deployments to the North African colony of Libya, directly threatening Egypt. At the same time, it must resume anti-British propaganda in the Near East. After Italy signed an agreement with Britain, it had hoped that Britain would intervene with France to support Italy's demands, but unexpectedly, the British government did not mediate. This is a point of disappointment for Italy.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Comments on German-Italian Alliance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, touched on the German-Italian alliance treaty. He said, upon close examination of the published provisions, it does not appear that any of them conflict with Italy's obligations to Britain. The obligations between Britain and Italy were first stipulated in the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement of January 2, 1937, and then reaffirmed by the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16, 1938. Prime Minister Chamberlain's mention of the German-Italian matter in the House of Commons is his first time doing so.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] Yesterday, sources in communication circles here stated that Regent Paul of the Southern Kingdom will not visit England in the near future. This news contradicts previous reports. Furthermore, the King and Queen of England are touring America and will not be able to return to the country for at least three weeks, after which they will rest in Scotland for four weeks. Therefore, the Regent's visit to England will not be realized until the end of October. It is reported that Prince Paul may travel to England in August or September in a non-official capacity. Regarding the British government's export credit loan to the country, sources in communication circles say that, as far as is known, this is merely a proposal from the British government. During Prince Paul's previous visit to London, he suggested that Britain provide a loan to the country to expand its military, but Prince Paul politely declined at the time.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 25th] According to an broadcast from the radio station, the British government is preparing to act as a mediator between Germany and Poland. Yesterday, the British Ambassador to Poland visited the Polish Foreign Ministry to seek the Polish government's opinion. Although the Polish side has not yet responded, people in London are very optimistic about this move.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 25th] Today, the "Polish Gazette" published an editorial advocating the establishment of a propaganda department whose main task is to invigorate Poles living abroad and pay attention to the interests of their homeland, especially at a time when European politics are tense. Those Poles living abroad who are concerned about Poland's measures should understand everything.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 25th] It is reported that an anti-German demonstration occurred in Konstantynów, a small town near Łódź in central Poland. The origins and details of the incident are difficult to ascertain because the leaders of the German organizations in the area have been detained by the authorities. One account says that about 20 people were injured in the incident, some seriously. In Łódź, Polish police stormed and searched the headquarters of the "German Citizens' Association," and the homes of several German citizens were robbed by rioters. The Citizens' Association is the largest German organization in central Poland.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 25th] It was announced here yesterday afternoon that the President of the Danzig Senate has lodged a serious protest with the Polish government against incidents of crossing the border of the Free City. It is said that the contents of the protest include six items: (1) In the past few days, several innocent passers-by have been shot by Polish troops near the border within Danzig. (2) A committee of inquiry sent by the Danzig authorities was blocked by Polish troops from performing its duties within the Free City. (3) Polish troops have repeatedly crossed the Danzig border on various occasions. (4) Polish military aircraft often fly over Danzig airspace. (5) A good traveler in Gdynia was shot dead by the chauffeur of a Polish diplomat. (6) The murderer was shielded by a Polish diplomat and taken to Poland. The protest also stated that, fortunately, the officials and people of Danzig have always maintained good discipline, so they have been able to maintain order, but it demands that the Polish government take appropriate steps to restore order to the Danzig border and prevent officials from acting beyond their authority.</p>

<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 21st] Professor Rommen, leader of the Dutch Christian Historical Party, today urged the government in the Senate to increase the number of ships in the Dutch East Indies fleet by three times in response to Japan's naval expansion. He said that strengthening defenses is extremely important to Australia. The average defense expenditure for British citizens is 14 pounds per person, while Dutch citizens only pay one-fifth of what British citizens pay for defense expenses. There are many reasons for the burden.</p>
<h3 id="e21">United States: Soviet Union Will Take a Stronger Stance in the Far East, Some Diplomats Observe; Japan's Position Will Become More Difficult <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The diplomatic observation that the Soviet Union "invaded Manchuria" is drawing close attention here, and there is speculation that this move is a rapid response by the Soviet Union to important Japanese events. These important events include the progress of the Anglo-Soviet agreement and other peace-based alliance actions. After the Soviet Union is confident in the security of its four-way border, it will adopt a stronger stance in the Far East. The Manchurian border incident occurred after the Anglo-Soviet alliance was about to be completed and Britain took a strong stance, pressing the Japanese army to withdraw from Gulangyu, which is noteworthy. Some observers believe that Japan's diplomatic and economic position will become more difficult in the future. The decreasing possibility of a European war allows the Soviet Union and Western countries to exert more pressure in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" claimed that according to reliable sources, the contents of the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance contain secret conditions, including providing aid to the East and providing Chiang Kai-shek with armaments and sending volunteer soldiers to join the guerrillas to resist Japan. It also said that the plan for the three countries to take unified action to attack Japan can be proven by recent events, such as the fact that the Outer Mongolian army is effectively under Soviet control and has repeatedly crossed the border to attack the Manchurian army. Furthermore, the actions of the British in Shanghai and Gulangyu and the dispatch of French military attachés to Chongqing can be seen as evidence.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Guilin, 25th] Yesterday, a major fire broke out in Bauska, a famous city in southeastern Latvia. Because most of the buildings there are made of wood and the wind was very strong, the city center was completely on fire within an hour after the fire started. Fortunately, the local fire brigade, with the assistance of fire brigades from nearby cities, worked hard to put out the fire, which prevented it from spreading. Currently, the city hall, two banks, two hotels, and more than a hundred other buildings have been burned down. Two villages near the city have also been affected. As of 6:00 PM, it was still burning. A church near the city, built in the 15th century, is a famous historical site, and contains many famous artistic objects, but fortunately it was not affected.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tallinn, 25th] According to the latest news from Bauska, the fire burned for four hours, resulting in the destruction of about 200 residential buildings and rendering about 2,000 refugees homeless. 20 people were burned to death and 8 were seriously injured. The South Latvian garrison and volunteer groups were mobilized to assist the fire brigade. Furthermore, the loss of materials is difficult to estimate.

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e27">Ominous Maritime Situation <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The maritime situation these days is extremely ominous. Based solely on the news published in large font by various newspapers over the past two days, there are at least the following items worth serious attention from Chinese and foreign individuals:</p>
<p>First, the sudden attack and illegal search of the British merchant Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. liner "Rampur" by the Japanese Navy on the 24th is a matter worth noting. One is that the incident occurred only one mile from Hong Kong. Second, the ship had on board the newly appointed Deputy Commander of the British China Fleet, Rear Admiral MacLear. Third, Britain and Japan are not at war, and British ships cannot tolerate such harassment.</p>
<p>Second, on the 24th, the French mail ship "Aramis" broke through an illegal search by the Japanese Navy for an hour. The incident also occurred only 17 nautical miles from Hong Kong!</p>
<p>Third, the situation in Gulangyu is becoming increasingly serious. The Japanese Consul General in Xiamen, Uchida, notified the foreign consular corps and settlement authorities there that the Japanese Navy will order a cessation of traffic between Gulangyu and the mainland starting at 6:00 PM on the 25th.</p>
<p>The main purpose of such illegal incidents by Japan is naturally to intimidate democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain and France, attempting to further occupy all concessions, seize the interests of European and American powers in China, and save the difficulties encountered in the current war of aggression against China. At the same time, we can see that the reason why the degree of the freedom of the world is not active and determined is precisely because a few stubborn leaders are attempting to prevent Japan from joining the German-Italian military alliance and revive the old dream of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and because the means adopted by Britain, the United States, and France to address the Gulangyu incident and the Shanghai concession incident are weak and powerless. Therefore, we can assert that if the democratic and peaceful countries do not take effective sanctions against Japan, then Japan's actions will not be limited to what it is doing at sea today.</p>
<p>Peace is indivisible! Any attempt to exclude the Far East from the anti-aggression front can only increase the chaos in the world and only increase the crisis in Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union will not accept this type of "anti-aggression" organization. The Chinese nation, which has been fighting for liberation and peace and whose war of resistance against Japan is nearing its second year, also has the right to speak up and warn the democratic and peaceful countries!</p>

<p>[Reuters, Winnipeg, 24th] The King and Queen of England arrived here at 10:30 AM today (local time). The royal car traveled west from Fort William yesterday. The King and Queen stayed overnight on the train last night. The King stated at a welcome meeting today that he had seen the vastness of Canada, its material construction, and its social life, all of which are very advanced. He then gave an "Empire Day" radio address, saying, "The cultures of Europe and Asia are now greatly trampled upon. The old world may need the guidance of the new world. When we speak of the new and old worlds, the connection and coordination between these two worlds is the greatest task of the British Empire. In long history, Europe has always been at the forefront of world progress, but the current situation is different from the past. European Christian culture is being trampled upon, and we are fighting to restore the original standards. Although this is a long and difficult task, we must still strive to do it. Asia is also suffering greatly, and people are in chaos. Is this not a time when the old world needs the guidance of the new world? Canada and the United States have jointly discussed the differences in their mutual interests and purposes over the past century, but they have never used force to resolve any differences. In the future, the people of the two countries will not harbor the heart of war. The greatness of the British Empire is not due to power, wealth, or self-governing territories. These things are merely tools, not the ultimate principles or purposes. The ultimate purpose is the freedom, justice, peace, and security enjoyed in common. The Empire must be able to increase the material happiness and spiritual dignity of the people before it can be said to serve its people and the world."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] At 10:40 PM tonight, an official announcement regarding Queen Mary's injuries stated that the Queen's condition continues to improve well, but the wound is still painful. X-ray examinations show that the bones have not been damaged and the eye injury is also trending towards recovery.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Today, the royal physician reported that Queen Mary slept comfortably last night and her facial injury is showing even more improvement. The Queen has sent a letter to the truck driver involved in the car accident, expressing her gratitude. The Society presented flowers to the person. Queen Mary has also sent a letter of thanks to the owner of the residence at the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Today in the House of Commons, a member inquired whether there was a diplomatic representative to safeguard British interests in Bohemia and Moravia, Czechoslovakia. Mr. Chamberlain replied that since the British Chargé d'Affaires left Prague on May 25th, British interests there were temporarily under the care of the consul. Regarding the British government sending a foreign representative to Prague and the relationship with Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, it is still under consideration, and he hoped to report on this matter soon. Subsequently, Mr. Chamberlain replied regarding Czech deposits in England, stating that informal talks are underway on this issue, but this is unrelated to the de facto recognition of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Then, Conservative members asked Mr. Chamberlain to guarantee that de facto recognition of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia would not be granted before the House of Commons agreed. Mr. Chamberlain replied that he would not make such a guarantee. Opposition members strongly protested and shouted "Another Munich!" Mr. Attlee then stated, "Can we assume that the government is only considering recognizing the current state of Czechoslovakia?" Mr. Chamberlain replied, "No, I did not say that. The reason I did not make that guarantee is because making that guarantee would be highly unusual." Mr. Attlee then declared that Mr. Chamberlain's answer was greatly unsatisfactory, so he would raise this matter again when the House adjourns on Sunday.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Legislative Council Meeting Passes Tenants Protection Ordinance Extension for One Year; Special Committee Organized to Study Amendments; Councilor Pugh Criticizes Increasing Civil Servant Pensions <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Legislative Council convened a meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. The most notable item on the agenda was the final reading of the Ordinance to Prevent Rent Increases and Evictions. The ordinance was passed yesterday, but the authorities simultaneously appointed seven members to form a special committee to consider amendments to the ordinance, as the authorities wanted to achieve fairness for both tenants and landlords. Fortunately, Chinese representatives Chow Chun-nin and Lo Man-kam are among the seven members. It is believed that Chow and Lo will surely seek benefits for all compatriots in Hong Kong, and the future amendments to the ordinance will certainly provide tenants with maximum protection. Regarding this matter, Lo Man-kam already had a written opinion yesterday, which was quite persuasive, stating that the ordinance affects real estate transactions. Also, during yesterday's meeting, Councilor Pugh also criticized the vast amount of pension payments to civil servants, stating that the retirement age for civil servants should be raised from 55 to 60, according to the law. The details of yesterday's meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>Cases Passed at the Meeting</p>
<p>Those present at yesterday's meeting included Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote, Colonial Secretary Smith, Commander of British Troops in China Major-General Grasett, Financial Secretary Gimson, Attorney General Eales, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Davis, Director of Medical Services Sutu Wenzhao, Councilor Pugh, Acting Commissioner of Police Barton, Director of Public Works Edgar, Woods, Tolloway, and Pierce. The meeting was chaired by Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote. After the meeting began as usual, Attorney General Eales proposed a well-organized plan to improve the form of existing or future urban areas and buildings, to enhance social health, safety, convenience, and public interest. A law was passed, followed by Financial Secretary Gimson's request for retroactive approval of $3,426,243.48 in expenses for 1938, which passed the second and third readings. Attorney General Eales proposed (A) amendments to the 1935 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance, (B) amendments to the 1934 Trustee Ordinance, (C) amendments to the 1936 Hong Kong Regulations Ordinance, and (D) amendments to the 1938 Undesirable Eviction Ordinance, all of which passed the second and third readings. Eales, Davis, Pugh, Feng Xinglu, Chow Chun-nin, Lo Man-kam, and Shao Liao Yali Mada were appointed as a committee to review the amendments to the Undesirable Eviction Ordinance. The meeting then adjourned immediately, and the Financial Secretary chaired a meeting of the Finance Committee, which approved the retroactive appropriation of $318,523 in government expenses. It was noted that during yesterday's meeting, when Gimson requested the passage of a retroactive appropriation of over $3.4 million in government expenses for last year, Senior Unofficial Member Pugh expressed some reservations. Barrister Lo Man-kam also commented on the Undesirable Eviction Ordinance. The speeches of Pugh and Lo are recorded below.</p>
<p>Councilor Pugh Criticizes Pensions</p>
<p>Your Excellency the Governor, regarding the proposal by Mr. Gimson to retroactively approve more than $3 million in government expenses for last year, I would like to say a few words for everyone present. During last year's budget discussion, the Financial Secretary stated that, considering only those with salaries in gold pounds, the number of pensions had doubled compared to 1930. This gradual increase has not yet reached its limit. I have also obtained statistics from the Financial Secretary's Office showing that this year's pensions will reach approximately $2.97 million. This large sum of pensions cannot but make one consider whether there is a good way to stop or at least slow down this increasingly high pension expenditure. Civil servants' enjoyment of pensions is a privilege granted by law. If pension payments were stopped, it would be unfair to civil servants. In this environment, what I want to ask you to consider is the provision in Section 2 of the 1928 Ordinance, which stipulates that civil servants can only enjoy pensions upon reaching the age of 60, instead of the current practice of 55. Currently, some civil servants who are not yet 55, but with the Governor's approval, can enjoy pensions at the age of only 50. The unofficial members of this Council believe that there is no reason for civil servants to enjoy long vacations back to England and to be allowed to retire before the age of 60. If civil servants are only allowed to retire at the age of 60, then the accumulation of pensions in Hong Kong will naturally be reduced.</p>
<p>Lo Provides Opinions on the New Ordinance</p>
<p>Lo Man-kam said in his speech: "When this ordinance to prevent landlords from evicting tenants was submitted to this Council on June 1, 1938, the Acting Attorney General deliberately stated that this ordinance was purely a temporary measure. At the same time, Your Excellency the Governor also said, 'My colleague, the Attorney General, has pointed out that if this ordinance is passed, it will be a temporary measure to safely navigate the current emergency situation, but I sincerely hope that in the near future, I will be able to replace this ordinance to prevent rent increases and evict tenants with another ordinance, so that we can return to a normal state of affairs. However, a normal state of affairs is not easy to obtain, and only if the economic situation in Hong Kong is better than the current situation can it be achieved.' Unfortunately, the environment we are currently in has not reached a normal state and is trapped in an abnormal state. Therefore, I sympathize with the continued implementation of this ordinance. This emergency regulation will be extended for another year (unless it is changed in the future). I believe that our responsibility should be to ask the authorities to make some amendments to the original text of the ordinance. The points to be amended have been sufficiently proven necessary by the implementation of the ordinance in the past year. However, after asking my colleague, the Attorney General, for his opinion in this Council, I agree that after this ordinance is passed, a special committee should be formed to consider the proposed amendments. However, I would like to take this opportunity to contribute a word on the issue of rent increases, so as to avoid countless phone calls and letters inquiring about this matter in the future. According to the original text of this ordinance, it is very clear that if a landlord wants a tenant to move out or increase the rent, the tenant can ignore it. However, if the tenant believes that the rent increase demanded by the landlord is excessive, then he can notify the landlord that he is willing to submit the rent increase event to the court for the judge to approve a reasonable rent value. The court will definitely handle this case fairly, and neither the landlord nor the tenant will be harmed. This ordinance provides tenants with the greatest protection in a normal state of affairs, but it is not fair to the landlord, because in this environment, the landlord has lost his business rights and lost the sovereignty that the landlord should have. This move has greatly threatened real estate transactions. Therefore, I hope that in the near future, Hong Kong will be able to achieve a more normal economic situation, so that this regulation to evict tenants and prevent rent increases will no longer be needed and can be replaced."</p>

<h3 id="e32">Tax Revenue Committee Recommends Ten Tax Increases; Income Tax Under Consideration <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(1) Increase fees for government schools; (2) Increase fees for government hospitals; (3) Increase stamp duty on horse racing tickets; (4) Increase franchise tax for telephone companies; (5) Increase franchise tax for gas and electricity companies; (6) Increase franchise tax and license fees for taxis; (7) Increase tax on alcohol and motor oil. If the above seven taxes are still insufficient, then levy (1) income tax, (2) corporate profits tax, and (10) increase property tax.</p>
<p>In order to study appropriate methods for opening up tax sources, the Hong Kong government appointed a Tax Revenue Research Committee on December 8th of last year to study the tax regulations that should be added when Hong Kong needs to increase tax revenue. After several months of research, the committee has prepared a report and submitted it to the government. The report was released at yesterday's Legislative Council meeting. According to the recommendations in the report, if Hong Kong needs to increase tax revenue by one million dollars, income tax should be levied. If the required amount is less than one million dollars, then other methods should be adopted. The details are listed in the report, as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the levy rate for income tax, the committee believes that setting a high rate of 5% is appropriate, but this rate can be increased to 10% in the future. It is said, "Even under this low tax system, and with reasonable exemptions for individuals, families, and others, and with sound implementation methods, the annual income from income tax in Hong Kong can still reach five million dollars. We believe that if the maximum income tax rate is 5%, then income tax can be easily implemented." The report recommends that if the government believes that smaller-scale tax regulations cannot meet the needs, then new tax regulations can be adopted. In addition to income tax, the committee also recommends two progressive tax regulations as follows: (1) Increase the current rates assessment from 17% to 2.5%. At the current rate, Hong Kong can obtain six million dollars in assessments each year. Calculated at the new rate, it can increase by three million dollars. (2) Levy a profit tax on Hong Kong companies and stores. According to the committee's estimate, the taxable profits of Hong Kong companies each year are approximately 50 million dollars, and the annual profit tax can obtain 2.5 million dollars. The committee advocates that income tax should be adopted first among the above three new taxes. Regarding the recommendation to increase the assessment rate, the report said that this increase is somewhat unfair or will cause social unrest. Therefore, although this recommendation is feasible and can be carried out without difficulty, and the income amount is larger, it should still be considered as the last item. Regarding the company profit tax, the report pointed out the difficulties in implementation, such as the difficulty in estimating and collecting, as well as incidents of opposition and evasion, etc. However, it said that although this method is still unfair, the scope of the shareholder class bearing this tax is still wider than the landlord class. The report recommends that before adopting income tax, profit tax, or increasing assessment rate methods, consideration should be given to promulgating smaller-scale tax regulations. According to the committee's estimate, these taxes can obtain at least 500,000 dollars or can reach 1 million dollars each year. The taxes recommended in the report are as follows: (A) Increase the tuition fee rate for English schools, but set up free classes to assist poor students. (B) Increase the medical expenses for patients in government hospitals. (C) Increase the betting tax rate. The current stamp duty on horse racing tickets is 5%, which can be increased by 1% or 2%, and the lottery tax is 2%, which can be increased by 1%. (D) Levy a special tax on telephone, electricity, and gas companies. (E) Approve the taxi franchise and collect franchise tax. (F) Increase the excess profit tax for the tram company. (G) Increase the tax on alcohol and gasoline. The committee has studied and opposed the increase in taxes and new taxes as follows: customs duties, import tax on luxury goods, salt tax, increase to four cents for local letters postage rate, ship inspection fees, vehicle tax, business license tax, interest tax on company stock holders not residing in Hong Kong, entertainment tax.</p>

<p>The annual "June 6th" Teachers' Day is approaching again. The Chinese education sector in Hong Kong holds a celebration every year. Now that the War of Resistance is in full swing, teachers are the implementers of the War of Resistance education. Therefore, this year's Teachers' Day is of extraordinary significance. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Associations Federation has now scheduled a preparatory meeting for next Monday evening (originally scheduled for yesterday, but temporarily postponed) to discuss the methods for commemorating Teachers' Day this year. The funds used by the Education Associations Federation for holding the Teachers' Day celebration each year are donated by the Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company. This year, due to the impact of the war, the two bookstores have stopped donating the funds. Therefore, the Education Associations Federation needs to raise funds themselves. It is reported that some party has recently promised to donate funds, so the persons in charge of the Education Associations Federation have begun preparations. It is reported that the opinions of the members of the Education Associations Federation believe that under the principle that the War of Resistance is higher than everything else, this year's Teachers' Day should be changed to a solemn and meaningful commemoration, and there should also be action in the action aspect to encourage the students to work harder for the national salvation movement. The association now plans to invite the National Salvation Drama Troupe to perform national salvation dramas on Teachers' Day to replace all other recreational activities.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association received a letter from Xue Yue, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government. The original letter stated, "Respectfully, the war is shaking China and the survival of the nation depends on this battle. Yue leads the three armies to fight in several provinces, and lives in the rain of bullets for almost two years. Although he has been repeatedly frustrated, he still hates that he has not recovered the lost territory. Looking at the rivers and mountains, his heart is cut. He was recently appointed to take charge of the military affairs of the XX war zone and concurrently the Hunan Province. He is a soldier who does not know how to govern and fears that he will not be able to win. He is confused by the appointment, not knowing what to do. Thinking of the difficulties and dangers, he is obliged to accept the order and rushes forward without hesitation. Moreover, this battle is a key point in military strategy and can protect the West. Hunan Province has suffered after the war and the administration must use both military and political means. He dares to reluctantly accept the task and do his best. Yue is a Cantonese and has been serving outside for several years, but he always remembers the kindness of the elders and brothers in his hometown and the hopes of compatriots at home and abroad. He hopes that your association will uphold the spirit of helping each other in times of difficulty and provide guidance so that he can follow it. This is what he hopes. He salutes the Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association. Xue Yue."</p>

<p>Everyone knows the danger of cholera. Last year, more than a thousand Hong Kong residents died from this disease, and even thinking about it now is terrifying. In order to avoid repeating last year's mistakes, the Hong Kong authorities are launching a large-scale cholera prevention campaign at the beginning of summer, in addition to guiding residents to implement cholera prevention injections, they are also prohibiting the sale of unclean ice cream, cool water, and moldy fruit, etc. Therefore, since the first case of cholera was discovered last year, although twelve more cases occurred last week, with ten deaths, it is not as serious as last year. It is believed that the preventive measures have been successful. According to news released by the health authorities, Dr. Situ Yongjue of the Health Medical Officer's opinion still fears that residents have not clearly understood the implementation of cholera prevention. Therefore, he has invited many formal Western doctors in Hong Kong to carry out weekly broadcasts and lectures on prevention methods. There are more than 8,000 residents in Hong Kong who have radios. There will surely be many listeners, and the effect will be considerable. However, Dr. Situ Yongjue believes that this kind of broadcast lecture may only be available to those who have radios in their homes. Other families and the general public will not be able to receive it widely. Therefore, he has formulated a method. For example, the broadcast lecture will be delivered this evening, and the original text of the lecture will be submitted to Chinese and Western newspapers for publication the next day. Thus, those residents who cannot listen to the speech on the radio can also obtain it from the newspapers the next morning. Then, only a small number of people will be left out.</p>

<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Facts, facts imprint upon our eyes, and carve into our minds:</p>
<p>The performers exhaust their minds and bodies, forgetting sleep and meals; the audience braves hardship, trekking through heavy rain to attend. Backstage, one can see the "China Salvation" friends working tirelessly despite insufficient rest. Surveying the second and third floors, one sees the densely packed audience, eagerly savoring the gunpowder scent of their suffering motherland, and receiving the baptism of a new China. The only imperfection is that the "automobile class" in the front seats is not as enthusiastic as the audience on the thirteenth floor.</p>
<p>——This, this is a bird's-eye view of the "China Salvation" troupe's premiere at the Lee Theatre last night.</p>
<p>At precisely 8:00 PM, Mr. Lu Guomian of the Relief Federation and Mr. Li Jianfeng of the Journalists' Association delivered speeches. They lauded the "China Salvation" troupe's achievements over the past twenty months, traversing north and south battlefields and moving millions of soldiers and civilians. They expressed gratitude for the troupe's benefit performance for the Relief Federation, raising funds to慰勞 wounded soldiers and refugees. They particularly praised the troupe members for abandoning their comfortable lives and dedicating everything to the motherland.</p>
<p>Following the national anthem, the great patriotic drama, "Long Live the Nation," unfolded with refined artistry.</p>
<p>Raging wind and torrential rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning. And a lone sail struggling amidst the storm, all vividly depicted, transporting the audience into the midst of a real scene. Bai Lu, playing Bao Wenxin, whose wife has been violated by the × people, expresses his resentment and panic. The jeers and lack of help from those who lacked courage fill him with disappointment. Jin Shan, playing Wei Dapeng, is ultimately a hero, extending help and saving him as he crosses the river.</p>
<p>The second scene of the first act reveals the cruelty of the × people oppressing our compatriots, forcing them to build barracks in the Northeast. Jin Shan displays heroism; every movement reveals his excellence and experience. Wang Ying, playing the traitor's daughter, Wei Ming, delivers each line clearly and powerfully, striking the hearts of everyone.</p>
<p>The third scene quickly appears. When three village leaders drink blood as an oath, the poignant line, "We are all of one mind," elicits warm applause from the audience. These are the words you say, the words I say, the words everyone wants to say.</p>
<p>The first scene of the second act begins in the countryside of occupied land. Wei Ming—played by Wang Ying—delivers the following cautionary words to reject the traitor who courts her: "Love! Do you think I am also living in a drunken dream? Do you think you can live this life as a traitor forever?" These are words that many, many people should remember.</p>
<p>The second scene of the second act is also in the countryside. Sparkling stars vividly depict the beauty of the night. The villagers of three villages are meeting to resist the violent × people. They mention that they all fled from Shandong to the Northeast, unable to suppress sighs of sorrow! Although each person has their own expression, they repeatedly say "Yes! Yes! Yes!" to the "one heart" against the × people.</p>
<p>Landlords who survived the disaster rise up like commoners to lead the resistance—past personal grievances are resolved—this is truly thanks to the Japanese.</p>
<p>The first scene of the third act is in Wei Dapeng's home. Ke Gang, playing Wei's wife, resembles a simple, tender farmer. Fan Zheng, playing Wei's son, is innocent and lively. In between, the father also educates his son about independence, which is very interesting. The brave father and son go to fight the × people heroically.</p>
<p>The humiliation of being forced to kowtow to the × army in the second scene of the third act truly fills one with resentment. Dapeng's refusal to submit to coercion deserves the love of the masses. The crowd holds its breath as the × people force him to shoot the apple on his son's head as a test before executing him. Although he luckily hits the apple, everyone is relieved. However, Dapeng still cannot escape the clutches of the × people.</p>
<p>In the fourth act, Wang Ying, playing Wei Ming, says under the threat of the × people: (This section is missing dialogue in the original text) This once again elicits warm applause.</p>
<p>Dapeng also escapes from prison—he believes in the power of the masses—the final days are approaching—Dapeng's "Hahaha..." laughter, a bitter and cold laugh, is truly a great laugh—a laugh that stops the × people!</p>
<p>In the final, fifth act, the × military camp is burned down! The shouts of the crowd are earth-shattering! The torches of the crowd symbolize the light of the nation. This is truly a magnificent scene! Although greater oppression is coming, through unity in the united front, the final victory will be achieved!</p>
<p>—The curtain closes amidst extreme excitement.</p>
<p>This drama, acting, sets, lighting... the gains in all aspects are so wonderful that we can't stop praising it. "China Salvation" is indeed "China Salvation," it is truly a new and progressive theatrical troupe. Tonight's "Protecting the Motherland" includes four of the "China Salvation" troupe's most skilled and famous short plays. These are their artistic masterpieces, beloved anti-Japanese war stories by millions of people. For the sake of disaster relief, for the sake of educating ourselves, for the sake of appreciating the most advanced theatrical art, we must mobilize all patriotic overseas Chinese to be the audience of "China Salvation."</p>

<p>(Northern Guangdong Express News) Our troops in Northern Guangdong have taken a surprise offensive posture and have been launching large-scale attacks towards Zengcheng, Conghua, and Huaxian for the past week. In the front-line battles, our troops have taken the initiative, steadily advancing, and the × troops are also desperately defending and attempting to resist to the death. The military situation in Northern Guangdong is gradually becoming tense, and the prelude to a major battle seems imminent. The war situation in recent days is as follows:</p>
<p>× Troops Attempt to Counterattack in Northern Guangdong</p>
<p>Military intelligence reports that, in response to our troops' continuous advances in Northern Guangdong, the × troops are not only building fortifications in the suburbs to prepare for in-line operations, but are also increasing troops to defend Xincun, Xinshi, Renhe, Taihe Town, and Zhongluotan, etc., as the outer lines of Guangzhou. On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, the Guangzhou-Hankou, Guangzhou-Huaxian, and Guangzhou-Conghua railway lines were extremely busy, as × infantry and cavalry moved north to reinforce the defense. The Guangzhou-Hankou line had the most reinforcements, with nearly a thousand troops arriving at Xinshi, Jiangcun, Gaotang, etc. in recent days. In addition to building fortifications, they are also actively preparing to advance and counterattack, attempting to pin down our troops from attacking. On the morning of the 22nd, the × troops in Xinshi also dispatched over a hundred cavalry, accompanied by two cannons, to scout Letong along the Guangzhou-Hankou railway. Our troops, a certain unit of Peng's division, calmly defended and counterattacked, repelling the × troops' repeated attacks and forcing them to retreat, abandoning over twenty corpses.</p>
<p>Attacking Renhe, × Troops Sneak South</p>
<p>On the Huaxian front, Zhao's division of our Twelfth Army Group has been sending troops deep into the × rear to attack in recent days. On the 21st, they launched another attack on Renhe Market along the Guangzhou-Huaxian line, engaging the × troops in fierce fighting in the area north of Renhe. Our troops attacked the × positions from several routes, charging bravely and repeatedly, but the × troops relied on their sharp artillery fire to cover their stubborn resistance. After several hours of stalemate, the × troops finally gave way, retreating back to Renhe to continue their stubborn resistance. Another group crossed the river and fled south. Our troops took advantage of the situation to pursue and kill them, forcing dozens of × troops to fall into the water. Only a dozen or so swam to escape, while the rest were drowned. Our troops are currently searching forward.</p>
<p>Our Guerrilla Teams Are Active Everywhere</p>
<p>Moreover, in the Shijing and Dalang areas of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, our guerrilla teams have been spotted operating and launching surprise attacks on the × troops in recent days. It was reported that on the night of the 21st, a dense sound of gunfire was suddenly heard near Dalang, intermittent for more than three hours before stopping. According to sources from a certain guerrilla team, on that night, over a hundred guerrillas from Li's unit attacked the Gaoseng near Dalang and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the × troops, using machine guns and hand grenades to attack each other. After several hours of stalemate, they killed over × troops, and our team sacrificed several men before retreating to their original position. Currently, our guerrilla teams are still operating along the railway line, specializing in destroying × communication lines, telephone and telegraph poles, and intercepting × military transport vehicles.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Express News) The Shaoguan garrison authorities, considering the inhumane actions of the × planes, which indiscriminately bombed our cities and towns, in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifices of the people and to preserve national strength, have decided to evacuate the population and resources of Shaoguan. They have been implementing this decision in recent days, and preparations are also being made actively. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Expanding Propaganda</p>
<p>The Shaoguan evacuation of population and resources was once discussed and decided upon by the garrison commander, Wu Naixian, who convened leaders of industry and commerce. In order to make the government's intentions clear to the people and to achieve significant results, it has been decided to expand propaganda. Students throughout the city will be mobilized to organize propaganda teams, which will go to various roads to expand official propaganda and explain the meaning of evacuation. At the same time, leaflets will be printed and distributed to every household. Most of the citizens who remained have followed the order to evacuate to the surrounding villages, so vehicles traveling to and from various places are crowded. In order to facilitate transportation, the garrison headquarters has instructed various transportation companies to increase the number of vehicles and prohibit arbitrary tolls.</p>
<p>Household Registration Inspection</p>
<p>Shaoguan has now become the center of party, government, and military affairs, a hub for issuing orders. All measures are being taken in accordance with wartime preparations. In order to prevent spies from infiltrating and disrupting public order, the garrison headquarters conducted a thorough inspection of household registrations throughout the city yesterday. It was stipulated that all relocations must be reported to the police station for verification. An order was issued for unemployed vagrants to leave the city, otherwise they would be taken in and assisted by the government. Patrol teams were dispatched to patrol the city, and anyone with suspicious behavior would be inspected or detained for questioning. The garrison headquarters also issued a notice stating that, regardless of who they are, except for fully armed military police, anyone carrying firearms must have a firearm license, otherwise they will be charged with disrupting public order. Yu Dang Chen Qizhen, Huang Yiru, Wen Wei, Gu Bimei, Li Baozhen, Jin Huanxian, Du Lanxi, Liu Zhen, He Zhuosheng, Le Xian, and Zhu Daizhi, Zhao Guizhen et al. are all brave and good fighters.

<p>(Shaoguan Express News) The Guangdong authorities have received a telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs, stipulating three measures for civilians to pay respect to anti-Japanese troops passing through their territory, and have instructed their subordinates to take note: (1) Vehicles and pedestrians (except for vehicles of the highest party and government officials) should stop immediately. (2) Those wearing hats should remove them and salute. (3) Those not wearing hats should bow their heads in salute. These measures are related to promoting the spirit of resistance and enhancing military-civilian relations, and the people of all regions must implement them conscientiously.</p>

<p>[West River Express] The fierce battle for Huicheng, Jiangmen, is becoming increasingly clear. Our troops are advancing on three routes, attacking along the Xinhe and Xinkai highways, while also cutting off the Jiangmen-Foshan road, so that Jiangmen and Huicheng cannot support each other. The × troops in Jiujiang cannot go to assist. At present, the × troops in Huicheng are trapped and unable to escape, while the × troops in Tingmen are stubbornly defending Fanluogang with artillery, but their situation is deteriorating day by day and they cannot hold out for long. Our army and brave teams from various regions, under the command of Commander Deng Longguang, have been able to fight bravely and give the × troops heavy blows everywhere. On the 20th of this month, Commander Deng also added the entire security 团 regiment to strengthen the actual strength of the attack on the lower part of Huicheng. They advanced along the Xinkai Highway towards Daze. The × troops sent planes to bomb Daze on the 22nd and 23rd for this reason. The regiment advanced to the front line with particularly rapid marching. Huicheng, surrounded on all sides by our army, has become a turtle in a jar. According to news received by the headquarters of the Zhongshan First District Guerrilla Detachment from the military headquarters, as of the 15th of this month, the ratio of casualties between our troops and the × troops in the Xinhui battle was one to two, that is, for every one of our soldiers who died or was wounded, two × soldiers died or were wounded, a new record in the national war of resistance. If the latest statistics are intercepted, the mortality rate of the × troops will be even higher.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Our Troops in the West Actively Deploy for Counteroffensive; Elite Troops of the Guangxi Army Head to the Front; × Troops in Various Strongholds of Sanshui Number Only Over Two Thousand; Our Guerrillas Active, × Extremely Panicked <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[West River Express] Our troops in the West River are unusually active in their military deployment for the counteroffensive. Several elite Guangxi army troops have also arrived at the front line in various counties along the West River and in the Siuhui and Sanshui areas. Among these elite Guangxi troops, there is also a female contingent, whose heroic appearance does not give way to men. It is reported that Siuhui, the left wing of the West River defense line, was originally the responsibility of Zhang Junsu's tax police regiment. In order to strengthen the strength in that area, Chief Commander Xia specially sent a strong troop to assist, which boosted morale even more. Now that they have completed close liaison with Li's division on the left wing of the northern line of Huaxian front, mutually echoing and supporting each other, our troops in the West River have entered a new stage. The large-scale counteroffensive is not far away. As for the situation of the × troops in Sanshui, the front line now reports that the commander of the × troops in the West River, Commander Zhongyuan of the Brigade, has been transferred elsewhere and replaced by Major General Matsumoto. The commander of the × troops stationed in Sanshui is Matsumotoo, and the headquarters is still located at the Shikou Customs. It is estimated that the Okane Makoguchi currently has around 500 troops from the Takata unit. The Kikuchi unit has a total of 700 troops stationed at Hekouzhen Nanxin Market, plus a unit of Matsumotoo of over two hundred people. There are also three to four hundred troops of the Matsumotoo unit in the Southwest. The total number of × troops in the various strongholds of Sanshui is around two or three thousand. They have been heavily guarded in recent days. After dark, all traffic is cut off, and traffic is only restored after 7 a.m., falsely claiming to protect public order. They restrict the people, regardless of gender, to receive so-called "good citizen certificates," otherwise they will be punished for violating the "imperial" order. The reason for this is to prevent our guerrillas from infiltrating and operating. All of the actions of the × troops show their tension.</p>

<p>(Express News) The Commander of the War Zone Headquarters sent a telegram to its subordinates yesterday, which stated: "Received a telegram from Bai Chongxi, Director of the Guilin Provisional Headquarters, on behalf of telegram number 221, that Han Cao, Director of the Political Department of the Headquarters, reported that Huang Qijun, Secretary of the Headquarters, submitted for review the case of prohibiting the import of a certain Hong Kong tabloid. Attached is the original endorsement and a copy of the newspaper. Upon review, it was found that the newspaper inverted right and wrong and fabricated an atmosphere of peace, and all its statements are absurd. If it is not strictly prohibited, there is a fear that it will spread and shake people's hearts. It is proposed to instruct the commanders of each war zone and the pacification commissioner of Guangdong and the Guangxi government to secretly prohibit it and not allow it to enter, so as to avoid confusing public opinion. Therefore, it has been found that the content of the newspaper is extremely absurd and should be strictly prohibited from import in order to avoid confusing reports. In addition to separate telegrams, it is hereby urgently telegraphed for compliance and instruction to subordinates for unified compliance in order to stop the flow.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Shaoguan Police Headquarters Balances Prices, Improves Air Defense <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express News) The newly appointed Shaoguan Garrison Commander, Wu Naixian, is paying close attention to balancing prices and improving air defense in Shaoguan, and is actively implementing measures. Regarding price balancing, Commander Wu has submitted the price controls of the previous administration for research. It is thought that the daily necessities that were originally controlled, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, do not have significant price fluctuations, so it is not necessary to re-evaluate them. However, other miscellaneous items and sewing wages, etc., tend to be raised taking advantage of the situation, or collected in silver dollars under various pretexts. Therefore, a meeting was held during the day with the Second District Executive Inspection Commissioner's Office and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to evaluate and resolutely stop price increases, so as to protect the people's livelihood. As for improving air defense, six points for citizens to pay attention to during air raids were also decided yesterday: (1) When evacuating during air raids, do not wear white hats or red and white clothing. Red and white clothing drying on the roof should also be taken back in advance to avoid revealing targets. (2) Buildings in the city and shelters in the suburbs must be camouflaged and painted in gray-black, grass green, and other protective colors, so as to reduce the target for enemy planes. (3) When an alarm sounds, each household should first extinguish the remaining fire in the kitchen stove before going out. (4) There are restrictions on easily flammable items stored in various stores in the city. Each store is only allowed to store one can of electricity, one can of kerosene, 10,000 firecrackers, and one box of matches. Those who exceed the limit will be punished. (5) When the third emergency alarm sounds, whether the public in the city or suburbs, should enter the air-raid shelters, or evacuate to the suburbs to hide, and it is forbidden for many people to gather in one place, or watching idly, to avoid exposing the target and causing disaster. (6) When an alarm sounds, various cars in the city should be driven to the suburbs or ways to hide them to avoid indicating a target, Chen Xi.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Shantou · In the Midst of a Frenzied Air Raid! <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xi</p>
<p>Just as the air raid alarm was lifted and I was preparing to go to the disaster area for inspection, the first alarm sounded again. After the × planes crazily bombed and reconnoitered the city center area again, they flew into the inner area, and people finally breathed a sigh of relief, sweating profusely, and clamoring to climb up from the shelter.</p>
<p>"Damn it, this Shantou is in trouble!" people said to each other.</p>
<p>Yes, Shantou, a small Chinese city in this southern country, has now become the best slaughterhouse for the × people, and I uncontrollably shed tears.</p>
<p>The rain was drizzling.</p>
<p>Suppressing my emotions, braving the rain, I made adjustments to places that suffered from the disaster today, after going through Shengping Road and the Xiaogong area in the urban area, I see the previous × bombing successes, broken tile, are all within sight.</p>
<p>There are many people on the streets, each with an adventurous heart, going to the bombed places to see, in order to have a deeper understanding of the brutal cruelty of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The places bombed in the morning were the municipal pavilion (market) on Shengping Road, the Guangdong Provincial Bank, and the Zhaoshang Street area, with a total of more than ten bombs dropped. Because the Guangdong Provincial Bank had air raid shelters, it did not collapse, but the magnificent building was covered with scars, and glass was scattered all over the street. Enemy planes had also bombed here last year, and old and new hatreds are entirely left for us to avenge! A small municipal pavilion was bombed to pieces, and rubble and ruins filled the road. The place where the bomb was dropped quietly opened its mouth, and water gushed out from below...</p>
<p>Zhaoshang Street, mostly residential houses, the × people's bombs have found a target -- one family of six were all slaughtered by the × people, a young woman who had only recently given birth was still pregnant, and the young sister and four-year-old younger brother... These defenseless people were all sacrificed in the mad bombing of the × people.</p>
<p>The rear of the Benshan Higher Court was also hit by several bombs.</p>
<p>I turned around to go back, but halfway there, the third × plane attack came, and after the alarm sounded horribly, people fled in panic, the dust rising into the air, mixed with drizzle, like a mist, like a wisp of smoke, and the earth was again in a hurry!</p>
<p>"The × planes are bombing indiscriminately without targeting, where on earth can we go to be safe?" I thought, and took shelter in a shop next to me. While writing, I always hear some businessmen cursing the cruelty and madness of the × people, yes, people have only deep hatred and great anger, and they will not fall into chaos and panic in their emotions for a while, but their will is becoming firmer!</p>
<p>The × planes seem to be more and more, although it is raining heavily, they are still hovering leisurely, and the huge plane keeps stirring the emotions of the people in the city. After the violent bombing passed, I, with a turbulent mind and stimulating thoughts, followed the lingering sound of the lifting of the alarm. I walked towards the disaster area with big strides.</p>
<p>This time, the areas that suffered were the slum areas of Wuqiao.</p>
<p>After passing through Tongji Road, the houses that had been bombed a few days ago were even more broken, and the muddy soil was mixed with rubble. The residents were very depressed, and the scene was exceptionally desolate and bleak!</p>
<p>The Tonghua Canning Company suffered the most damage, and the large-scale factory is now scarred!</p>
<p>After walking a while, I saw a shed of debris flying all over the sky, and the air was very dirty, with the smell of blood and gunpowder. One could have imagined that this seemed to be another world, but today it was hit by five bombs!</p>
<p>The affected area is very wide, and eighty or ninety Western-style houses have collapsed. Pieces of broken walls were blocking everywhere, and the rescue team was trying their best to search back and forth. One after another of the screens was lifted out, here there were dozens of old people, a few-month-old children, amputated limbs, and dry blood heads, there were also viscera that was separated from bones and flesh... I did not dare to look at the dead's family members who had not suffered much. They were weeping in hundreds of houses, and the distressed people who had not been harmed were standing in the heavy rain with pale faces (this is their only resting place)... in a daze…</p>
<p>We traversed these ruins, and in the rubble, I also saw a finger that had been severed by a bomb and some broken bones and flesh, and piles of bloodstains, and rainwater was mixing with them. By the side of the small road, there was a dead piglet and a puppy. They had suffered the same fate as their masters, with their intestines and organs hanging outside.</p>
<p>After inspecting for a week, my heart was about to break, and my emotions rose to the highest point, sadness, anger, and 共愾心!</p>
<p>When I got home, just as I was about to come forward to accuse humanity, the alarm outside, "Wee-wee-wee-wee-," sounded again.</p>
<p>Yes, the slaughter is going on, and the sacrificed compatriots are increasing, but one day we will pay back tooth for tooth and eye for eye, ××××××××××!</p>

<h3 id="e52">American Television Color Film Success: Can Watch Movies at Home This Summer Without Going Out; Expensive Price May Limit Popularity <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Following sound films, another revolution in film history, undoubtedly, is television. According to our recent information, American television films are moving from theory to reality. Let us present the news from America below:</p>
<p>(1) The Beginning Year</p>
<p>1929 in America was the year television truly began, with special emphasis on the word "began." Radio broadcasting started in 1920, but commercial radios only began to be installed in 1922, and sound was only normal and good by 1924. By 1926, radio phonographs were being mass-produced and forming a radio network. Therefore, in fact, it was only at this time that radio could be said to have truly become popular. After several more improvements, television is starting this year, and the first step—regarding technical, planning, and economic issues—will also be determined this year. By summer, people can install electric film machines in their homes.</p>
<p>(2) General Structure</p>
<p>So, after this kind of television becomes popular, what will we see? How much will it cost to buy a television machine? Let's first talk about the situation of television films. In America, the National Broadcasting Company and Columbia Broadcasting System are indeed going to television this year. They are using the cathode ray system. Based on a tube called cathode ray, the sound emitted is very simple. The main purpose is for people to watch, but behind it, the electrical configuration is very complex. For example, in engineering, countless people have put in painstaking efforts to research and improve it to achieve today's progress. It is also of great interest to briefly describe this method here. In the vacuum tube, there is a kind of light that is completely non-directional, forming a starlight point. It is projected onto the end of the tube, and this light is constantly changing in light and shadow, shaking forward very quickly, while shaking up and down very slowly. After these two movements combine light and shadow, they can control the light points of the image. We saw that early researchers of television films all relied on mechanical aspects to determine large projectors that could play 440-line films, and the current number of lines is based on this number. Later, when the cathode ray was invented, moving at high speed could achieve further success compared to low-speed non-enlargement, non-increased sound, and no increase in machine costs.</p>
<p>(3) Progress of Research</p>
<p>After having a method, the interest of the general researchers of television films is concentrated on the research of cathode rays. The one currently used is this type. In addition, relative to this type of television film, a William Price force microphone has also been invented, using a camera, a kind of dry film (very similar to photographic dry film), installed on the cathode ray tube. This dry film is covered with countless photosensitive cells, and the image is focused on this dry film. A cathode ray electron crosses this film, sucking away the lines of the image one by one, and quickly transmitting the image. The actions of the camera and receiver are completely consistent. The same image is sent and received multiple times. On one hand, it is a straight-line swing, and on the other hand, it is a horizontal-line swing. Using this method, the film must have 441 lines to repeatedly television the image. During transmission, sound is also transmitted simultaneously in the channel. On the receiving end, various symbols must be dispersed and amplified.</p>
<p>(4) Expensive Price</p>
<p>Since the structure of the machine is so complex, whether it is the transmitting or receiving machine, the cost is certainly much higher than ordinary radio broadcasting or radio receivers. Under these circumstances, the size of the film must be very appropriate, and a good recording machine can project a film of at least 7.5 inches by 10 inches in size. This requires a huge type of ray tube, but the price is very expensive, about US$390 to US$500 per machine. If you must spend less money, then you can only buy a smaller 3-inch by 4-inch film, and the price is about US$150 to US$200 per machine. Currently, it is probably not possible to buy a cheaper receiver. Large cathode ray tubes require strong protective materials to limit the film. Using high current does not necessarily have accidental dangers, but automatic ignition and heat-generating machines can cause "snowflakes" on the screen. Finally, it is necessary to replace 441-line films with 200-line films. This has become an important issue in television films. However, general engineers are optimistic, believing that these small problems are easy to handle. It is said that after cathode ray films become popular, they can be resolved in a few years.</p>

<p>Higgins was almost beside himself with anxiety. Hearing this, Mrs. Pearce said, "Professor Higgins? It's a rather cold morning, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Her words dispelled all his joy.</p>
<p>"Don't you adopt that tone with me," he said angrily. "Come home with me. Don't be a fool!"</p>
<p>"How can a girl refuse such an invitation?" she asked, shrugging her shoulders. "I should like to grow into a lady like him--not to be forced to be one."</p>
<p>Clare begged her to return. "Won't you forgive him? He doesn't realize how he speaks to you."</p>
<p>"That is his profession," she said, shaking her head. "My real education began the day you called me 'Miss Doolittle.' I shall always be a well-behaved child to you, because you always behave properly to me." Her lip curled. "But to him I shall always be a flower girl, because he always treats me as a flower girl."</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Clare and Mrs. Pearce, Higgins had already left the room. Higgins and Eliza were soon engaged in a violent quarrel.</p>
<p>"You're a devil," cried Eliza. "I can't bear being treated like this. I want some kindness."</p>
<p>"If what you get doesn't satisfy you, you can go somewhere else for it."</p>
<p>"If I can't have kindness, I can live alone," she said proudly.</p>
<p>"Live alone?" he laughed.</p>
<p>"I can teach. I can teach people phonetics, the way you taught me." She laughed, too. "I could be an assistant to Professor Karpathy."</p>
<p>His face turned white. "Ah!" he cried.</p>
<p>She gazed at him as though she had never seen him before. "I know now how to manage you. I used to grovel under your feet. Now I stand level with you."</p>

<h3 id="e55">Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament: Strength Review of the Top Four Teams; Zhixing and Zhonghua are the Strongest, Southwest and Huaxiong are also Fierce <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>... The long-rumored Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Tournament is scheduled to begin on the 29th of this month. It is now suspected to be on the eve of a great battle. Each team is participating for charity and is trying to strengthen its strength. Therefore, in recent days, each team has been preparing and sharpening its weapons, waiting for the god of war to descend.</p>
<p>... A total of four strong teams are participating in this battle, namely Zhonghua, Zhixing, Southwest, and Huaxiong. The strength of each team has its own merits. In the future competition, it is not yet known who will win. Therefore, before the war, it is worthwhile to review the strength of each team.</p>
<p>Zhixing Team: Zhixing is a strong team among the top four. A group of girls are capable of fighting, and many are good players in the National Games. For example, their former player, Chen Rong, has long been famous in the country and is a versatile girl. Chen Jinchai once represented Shanghai in the East Asian Games and is also a front-runner. Xiang Wangfang and Sun Yuming are famous players under the banner of middle school girls. They are experienced in combat. Therefore, the forward line is said to be unusual. The defense is exceptionally tight, and no matter how fierce the opponent is, it is not easy to break through their defense line. Lin Shao is a veteran of Meifang. Both offense and defense are official. The rest, such as Zhai Zhen, Huang Yiru, Lan Weili, Gu Junzheng, Li Maizhen, Jin Huanxian, Du Xishi, Liu Jiezhen, He Zhuosheng, Liang Baoxian, Du Daidi, Zhao Guiye, etc., are all brave and good at fighting. In short, this team is indeed a strong army.</p>
<p>Zhonghua Team</p>
<p>Zhonghua has many good players under its banner, and its combat strength is exceptionally strong. Like Liu Shouguang's overcoming obstacles and killing generals, she is exceptionally brave, and she is also a National Games representative. She has enough combat experience and superb skills. He Jingxiong and Xi Fen's defense is stable, and it is not easy to pass through their checkpoints. Rong Jiaozhen is a strong player among overseas Chinese and is quite famous in the basketball world. In addition, the Rong sisters are commanding and fighting, and Li Chunjing, He Shangying, Ye Muzi, etc., have unique abilities in attacking. Zhang Runlan, Cui Li, Yang Qiong, etc. are also fighters. Therefore, the entire army's combat strength is exceptionally strong and comparable to Zhixing. Therefore, this glorious silver cup is definitely for these two strong teams. But in the future, who will rule the world, it is still impossible to judge without a final battle.</p>
<p>Southwest Team</p>
<p>Although the overall strength of the Southwest army is not as strong as the Zhonghua and Zhixing teams, they have already shown their full combat spirit in previous competitions. They are very full of spirit. He Huanxiang, Qiu Meihe, Zhu, etc., work well together in offense and defense. Wu is also on the team. Xin, Li, Ye Peiye, Wu Suzhen, etc. are quick-witted and can make the opponent feel inexplicable pressure. In addition, Feng Zhenhua, Song Lan, Huo Qunying, and Zhang Huiying in the rear are also good in skills, although they are in the reserve. One day, they will confront Huaxiong, Zhonghua, Zhixing, etc., and there will be a big battle, and it will definitely not be easy to defeat them. There is no doubt.</p>
<p>Huaxiong Team</p>
<p>Huaxiong is a well-organized army, slightly inferior to the above three teams, but with Xia Shuyi, Lei Xiaogui, Wen Suxin, Chen Qixia, etc., it seems that their strength is also strong. There are also Zhong Ziqing, Zhou Duan, Wen Lingyu, Peng, and Wu Wenruo who all have considerable combat experience. Therefore, we are sure that this women's army has the ability to compete with each team. It will not be ashamed of itself. When they meet on the battlefield in the future, its strength will be revealed.</p>

<p>The South China Athletic Association, as its football team will be departing for a tour of the South this month, had scheduled a charity match between the South Tour team and the Hong Kong League team on the 20th of this month at the Jia Shan Stadium. The ticket proceeds were to be allocated to the sports community's service corps for handling relief for war-stricken refugees. However, due to inclement weather on the scheduled date, the heavy rain prevented the event from taking place. It was rescheduled for the next day, but it still could not be realized due to rain. It has now been determined that the South Tour team has postponed its departure to the 30th of this month, so the match against the Hong Kong League will be rescheduled for the 27th of this month (Saturday) at 5:00 PM at Jia Shan. This is the team's performance before departure. It is a matter of charity. We hope that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong will enthusiastically come to watch and not miss the opportunity. The ticket prices remain the same without increase or decrease. The team lineup for that day is listed below:</p>

<p>—Zou Falu</p>
<p>Before describing the combined movements of multiple people, there are a few points to declare that readers must pay attention to, so that the direction and movements of each person will not be confused or unable to figure out.</p>
<p>1. The far end of the mat is called the front, the near end is called the back, and the two sides are called the sides.</p>
<p>2. For the lying or lying posture, the one with the head facing forward or backward is called straight, and the one with the head facing both sides is called horizontal.</p>
<p>3. The people doing the movements are replaced by the words "A", "B", "C", etc. according to the standing position during preparation. The one standing at the front is called A, and the one standing slightly behind is called B, and so on.</p>
<p>B. Two-Person Movements</p>
<p>(66) Face-to-Face Forward Roll—Preparation: A lies supine on the mat with head facing back, feet separated and raised, and both hands holding B's feet on the shoulders. B stands with feet separated in front of A's shoulders, raising both hands forward to hold A's feet. Action: B pushes A's feet to the mat, while rolling forward, A tightly grips B's feet, and rises with B's momentum. Then, use B's method to roll forward, so rising and lying together, continuously moving forward. Note: The roller must first push the feet of the person lying down to the mat, so that the head does not hit the mat. The person lying down must tightly grip the roller's feet, so that it is easy to stand up. Both people must be fully curled up, and the movements must be continuous.</p>
<p>(67) Face-to-Face Backward Roll—Preparation: Same as before, but the positions and directions of the two people are reversed. Action: A falls backward to roll, and reaches the supine position. B raises the feet at A's rear to assist, and rolls backward. When A rolls, take the opportunity to stand up, and then fall backward to roll, so continuously doing it. Note: The two people must always maintain a curled posture, and must hold the other person's feet close to their own shoulders.</p>
<p>(68) Face-to-Face Backward Fall—Preparation: B lies supine with the back facing forward, with the body forming a reverse "bow" shape, hugging A's waist. A stands in front of B with the back facing forward, and bends over to hug B's waist. Action: A hugs B and leans backward, forming the posture of B's preparation. After B lands both feet firmly, immediately hug A backward like A did, so continuously doing it. Note: The two people must hug each other's waists tightly, and their feet must be separated.</p>
<p>(69) Back-to-Back Forward Roll—Preparation: A lies prone on the mat with the head facing forward. B stands forward about one step behind A. Action: B bends forward, placing both hands on the mat next to A's hips, and uses the forward somersault method to flip over A's back, then lying prone. After B flips over, A immediately flips over B's back like B did, so continuously doing it. Note: The distance between the two people is such that the hips of the person lying down and the shoulders of the person flipping are just right. The person lying down must take the opportunity to raise their arms to assist when the person flipping is over their back. (4)</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Chaos of Financial Affairs in Tianjin and Beijing Under Japanese Control: The Value of "United Reserve" Counterfeit Notes Plummets, Distrusted by Chinese and Foreign Merchants <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>A Beiping correspondent's report from the Zimo News on May 2nd states: The Zimo News recently published an article by its Tokyo correspondent, which stated that the Japanese authorities are currently drafting a grand plan to develop gold mining on the border of Rehe and Manchuria. Furthermore, the extracted gold will be used to strengthen the resources of the "United Reserve Bank" established in Beiping, and to help establish control over the financial affairs of North China and expand foreign trade in the region. If the bank's hope of strengthening its resources relies solely on this, then such assistance will be slow to materialize. Currently, due to the continued sharp decline in the value of "United Reserve" banknotes, North China is facing the risk of a severe monetary crisis. When the reporter was drafting this report, the "United Reserve" currency was being discounted by more than 35% against the legal currency. Day after day, the currency continues to plummet in value, and the monetary issue is the sole topic of discussion here in recent days, even surpassing the aftermath of the war. The residents of Beiping are now showing worried expressions, whispering among themselves, "Is the new currency going to become worthless?" They seem quite shocked, which reduces the credibility of those so-called financiers, because those who understood the nature of the "United Reserve" from the beginning stated that this kind of banknote, without any reserve fund, would not be able to gain value, no matter how the Japanese declared it or enforced it with bayonets. The public's panic has some basis, as we have already seen some warning signs of financial chaos, such as the rising cost of living, with stores raising the prices of various goods daily. Essential goods like flour and kerosene, as well as all imported goods, are increasing in price. A 40-pound bag of American flour, which could have been obtained for six yuan three weeks ago, now requires seven yuan and twenty cents. Railway fares have almost doubled, and return tickets cannot be purchased. Even local taxes in this city have been repeatedly increased. As for foreign shops, they have recently started pricing in pounds or gold dollars. The free exchange of "United Reserve" currency at par with the Japanese yen has been restricted, and today the restrictions are even tighter. Only specially permitted Japanese merchants are able to obtain a limited amount of Japanese yen at the Yokohama Specie Bank. There are various reasons given for the decline in the value of "United Reserve" currency. One explanation is that a large amount of foreign flour is imported into North China, and now importers have to pay for it in foreign exchange, which can be obtained with legal currency. However, the Japanese have issued regulations to implement searches and confiscations, forcing the legal currency out of formal circulation. Therefore, a large amount of legal currency cannot be obtained unless at a very high premium. This is one reason, but not the whole story. While it can explain the price increase of a few goods and the considerable premium on legal currency, it does not account for the sudden collapse of the value of "United Reserve" currency and the general distrust. It is widely rumored that Japanese expatriates in North China are willing to pay any price to get rid of the "United Reserve" currency, which is one example. Many believe that this is the cause of the continuous decline in the "United Reserve" currency, and there are rumors that the Japanese yen will also be devalued, which makes the general public even more uneasy. The fact that the "United Reserve" currency, currently valued at about six pence five, can be exchanged for the officially fixed price of one shilling and two pence for a Japanese yen, but with some restrictions, clearly illustrates the financial chaos here at present. Those who watch the financial oddities of other parts of the world with a cold eye now find that Chinese merchants who were still demanding payment in "United Reserve" currency a few months ago are now earnestly asking customers if they can pay with legal currency instead. Or, stores that previously stated firmly that they would only accept "United Reserve" currency are now reissuing notices stating that they will price their goods in some kind of gold coin in the future, which should not cause any surprise. There are many on the Japanese side who are talking about "taking decisive measures now," but even Japanese military and financial experts cannot explain what kind of bold measures can make a worthless currency gain value. There are also those who advocate stopping all goods from being imported into North China. This measure may temporarily prevent the "United Reserve" currency from falling further, but it is only temporary and will only increase financial chaos. The implementation of this measure will cut off the source of some essential goods that Japan cannot obtain, the cost of living will continue to rise, it will have an adverse effect on the Japanese yen, and widespread smuggling will occur, while the exchange rate of the "United Reserve" currency will still not be resolved. Products from some inland areas, such as cotton, peanuts, silk, eggs, etc., still have to be paid for in legal currency, and since the amount of legal currency is small, it gradually rises in premium. In the end, it is doubtful whether the public's trust in the "United Reserve" currency, which has no reserves, can be restored. The only sound strategy is to admit failure and gradually withdraw this new currency, just as when a large amount of Japanese yen flowed into China last year. But this is just a suggestion, and it is unlikely to be adopted by the Japanese. Considering that the Japanese currency experiment in North China has suffered a disastrous failure, and yet Japanese military and financial experts are still determined to use another "independent" new currency in Central China, it becomes even more apparent that they are unwilling to accept any advice.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Everyday Health Issues <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Question] My body is very weak and I often get sick. What kind of food is both economical and has the most nutrients for maintaining my health?</p>
<p>[Answer] The common belief that expensive foods have the most nutrients is a misconception. According to reports from researchers, bird's nest and shark fin are not as nutritious as tofu. We need to provide our bodies with the appropriate needs. The foods our bodies need can be divided into five categories: (1) carbohydrates, (2) fats, (3) proteins, (4) minerals, and (5) vitamins (or vitamin). Due to space limitations, I cannot say much here. Now, I will only cite one or two kinds of daily food, which are very beneficial to the body and meet the economic conditions, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Brown rice and black bread: They contain vitamin B and minerals. Eating them often can treat beriberi and promote growth and development. They can especially replenish blood, because brown rice and black bread contain large amounts of the minerals copper and iron, and are easily absorbed.</p>
<p>(2) Beans: There are many kinds of bean products, such as dim sum, vegetables, tofu, and soy milk, which are too numerous to mention. They are cheap and easy to buy. Beans are very nutritious, containing a large amount of plant-based protein, with a composition almost similar to that of beef, and with more iron than milk. Special blood-tonifying products sold on the market mostly contain iron as the main ingredient. Instead of spending more money on blood-tonifying medicines, it is better to eat more tofu products. For example, three taels of soybeans can make two pounds of soy milk, which only costs twenty-two cents. I hope that people who want to maintain their health will eat some bean products every day.</p>
<p>(3) Vegetables: Green vegetables also contain a large amount of minerals, and are also rich in various vitamins. Moreover, the fiber of vegetables is not digested by the intestines and stomach. It can cleanse our intestines and stomach, relieve constipation, and is beneficial to health. Therefore, everyone should eat more vegetables in every meal. This is an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>[Question]: After being sick, my body feels very weak. I want to do a very light exercise to recover my health as soon as possible. What kind of exercise is more appropriate?</p>
<p>[Answer]: To recover from an illness, it's not just about exercise. In addition to exercise, attention should be paid to diet, mental well-being, and other aspects. Only by combining these with exercise can it be effective. Regarding light exercise, you can take walks outdoors or in the countryside, preferably in the morning. Except for wind and rain, it is advisable to do it every day. In this warm and sunny spring, walking in the countryside can not only absorb fresh air and the warmth of the sun, but also add to the pleasure of the mood from the beauty of nature. Green seedlings and yellow flowers on mountain roads and in fields can stimulate personal interest and regulate physical fatigue everywhere. Several miles of walking every day can provide suitable conditioning for both the mind and body. I hope that people with very weak bodies will actually try it.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Light Smoke <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>I sit down to write a "small package" to a distant place.</p>
<p>For the past two years, I have been saving every bit of time from sleeping, eating, and resting to write letters as heavy as small packages to that missed distant place. It has become a habit. Of course, chasing after the green bicycle and receiving the small packages sent quickly from the bulging bag has also become a habit.</p>
<p>The days seem like a lonely house. In this house, I settle down. The past autumn has passed, and the winter days are still not my own. When spring comes, I am simply afraid. This is Tangmuchi Nash's spring. There are no swallows, no old women chatting and laughing under the sun. So I sit down again, filling my blank minutes and seconds with words. How I cherish a bit of classical enthusiasm and a bit of modern rationality. This is why I have been writing heavy small packages for two years without the slightest fatigue.</p>
<p>The days flow by. Today is a continuation of yesterday, and tomorrow will have even fainter memories and lighter smoke. This is why I treasure a letter sent from a distant place without the slightest fatigue.</p>
<p>Everything is reopened from memory. I miss Shanghai. I was originally used to living on that free land. I should return to that land. Although Shanghai has been through air raids and burning, the fallen Shanghai is on a distant continent across the ocean, and the dark sea is stormy. I miss the lone island among the cracks. So, in troubled night dreams, I cross the smoky haze of April and fly back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>This is already a distant matter. I bit on the rubber band and walked briskly across Nanjing Road. In spring, I lay on the grassy ground of Wusong Beach, leisurely puffing on a peachwood pipe. This is even more distant. I, like a little snail, carried a bookbag on my back to school. Gradually, I learned how to stroll lonely on the campus. The black fence, the red roof, the leaves of the white-collar trees unfolded a dense dream. I would pant for the footsteps as broken as small white flowers and write delicate poems for the playful temples and beautiful waists.</p>
<p>And on this afternoon in the sky, the suburbs of Shanghai should be covered with weeds, and the swallows should be clearly chirping. In the room with a bit of sunlight, what I think of is something else.</p>
<p>In troubled night dreams, I cross the smoky haze of April and fly back to Shanghai. Morning white sunlight finally comes. The silhouette outside the paper window is colorful. I sleep sweetly and then wake up sweetly. The homecoming dream comes and disappears like light smoke. I go out to breathe the morning air in the morning sunlight. Isn't that a girl on the edge? People are young and without love.</p>
<p>The beginning of a day, the beginning of some other loneliness. I am still as lonely as a polar bear, sitting up and walking by myself, going to the train station for a walk. My shadow is also lonely. I see the locomotive spewing black coal smoke and then begin to dream black-horned dreams on the black coal smoke. I stare for a long time at the black and long whistle of the train under the blue sky.</p>
<p>The artillery fire of the year before last made me leave the Huangpu River. The wings of the Huangpu River and the half-goddess have been dimmed. The troops in Zhabei are on alert for the first bullet fired from the sky. In the days that followed, I only missed the day of returning to the Huangpu River and continued to turn my back on the beacon fire in the east, making a long journey to the distant southwest.</p>
<p>Now I am completely tired. I settle down in this quiet mountain town. Occasionally, I reach out to pat the dust off my clothes. I want to this is the dust brought from eight different provinces. I can name a hundred unknown towns and villages and say everything about the ancient roads I have passed through. Those are canyons, those are passes, dreamy and rushing rivers, wide and open sandy beaches, and dark harbors. Where is the ferry where travelers board the boat, and where are there not the homes where lodgers knock? I can remember every arduous journey.</p>
<p>I fully understand that in this dangerous and murderous era, countless blood flows for every inch of land. The wings of war have spread to every corner. Artillery fire is indifferent to the lives of all people. We have been turning our backs on the beacon fire in the east for too long and too far for some reason. We cannot rush to the artillery fire, but are chased on a long journey to the distant southwest.</p>
<p>Although I have gradually become unfamiliar with the past, the suburbs of Shanghai have been flooded and burned, or floating as lone islands, in the oceans away from the mainland. And tomorrow there will be memories even fainter than today, and lighter smoke. Although I let the memories become lighter, I no longer regret the past days of biting on the rubber candy and walking briskly across Jing'an Temple Road; in the spring, lying on the grassy ground of Wusong Beach, leisurely puffing on a peachwood pipe. Moreover, I am even indifferent to the memory of loyalty, and I no longer have such a passionate perfect teaching feeling for the beautiful and even more beautiful incarnations.</p>
<p>However, I linger at the train station for a long time. I see the locomotive spewing black smoke and then dream black dreams on the black coal smoke. This train is filled with so many crowded passengers every day. It stops here and then departs from here to a distant harbor.</p>
<p>So on this spring afternoon, when a bit of sunlight comes into my room, what I think of is something else: From that distant harbor, you can reach an even more distant harbor. Finally, I will discover the yellow and turbid sea water from a small, round accident. The Huangpu River is still so yellow and turbid, flowing, and what is more, it is now temporarily covered with shame, so yellow and turbidly ashamed, flowing out of the Wusongkou, merging with the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Yes, I miss Shanghai. I am going back, going back and leaving again. So I sit down to write a small package to a distant place.</p>
<p>For two years, I have been so accustomed to filling my blank minutes and seconds with words, but now I no longer have this amazing patience. I am young, so I cannot help but have a youthful irritability. Still, in this war, I cannot rush to the artillery fire, but I want to visit some war zones, visit the hometown of flowers and blood that fell in May, and finally, I will see Shanghai on the Huangpu River, like a wounded beast, blankly and blankly curled up on the bank of the Huangpu River, biting its own tail, grieving, and wanting to avenge in grief. It has been almost two years,</p>
<p>Everything is reopened from memory. Let tomorrow have memories even fainter than today, and lighter smoke. I want to walk back to Shanghai step by step, re-freshing my memories, always so freshly and you stay.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Passing Baisha <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>The continuous summer rain made the stream under the Jiqiao Bridge, which is dry all year round, overflow. After the rain, the sun appeared in the clouds, revealing itself after a fresh bath.</p>
<p>I had been bored by the rain in Taicheng for a few days. If the rain didn't stop today, I thought, twelve hours would become as long as twelve days. However, when I washed my face, the sun brought the good news of clearing skies.</p>
<p>For many days, I have been thinking of Baisha all the time: I miss this town, just as I miss a seriously ill close friend. Baisha is locked in layers of mountains. In the past, it only took three or two hours by train to reach it. But now it won't work. The railway has been dug into countless deep holes, and many locomotives have been torn into small pieces by × planes. To go there, I can only rely on walking on two legs.</p>
<p>The journey is more than thirty li, but the actual travel will exceed this distance: because countless small hills have been built densely on the road, I have to climb over those newly filled small hills one by one, and I don't know how much the curve has lengthened the journey!</p>
<p>Along the way, there is a small hill, a pond (a newly dug hole filled with rainwater), arranged in an orderly manner, close to the slippery path along the pond, and a careless step will fall into a new pool ten feet deep. It is also difficult to walk on that small hill, because the tall mud has been watered into a gelatinous substance. With each step, the boots sank for the most part, and it took a lot of effort to lift them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after walking halfway, the second half was not destroyed. I looked at the flat second half of the journey, breathed a sigh of relief, walked into a small stall's hut, drank a glass of boiled water, and mustered up my energy to move forward.</p>
<p>After bypassing one mountain, another mountain with a different appearance came out to greet me. At dusk, I vaguely saw the rooftops of Baisha City appearing in the gaps between the mountains. At that time, I was both happy and anxious. The pace was heavy, as if I had a fever, probably because I hadn't walked a long distance for a long time.</p>
<p>When I entered Baisha City, I did not feel the joy of reunion after a long absence, but the mood of inquiring about the illness and injury of an old friend.</p>
<p>I first found an acquaintance there and asked him to take me around to explore the traces of the bombing. As it happened, this friend was a student at the Min University Affiliated Middle School. He had also experienced the atmosphere of danger during the bombing.</p>
<p>He told me: The blood-stained day was March 30.</p>
<p>He also told me: Eight planes came that day, five of which went to Chikan, and the remaining three circled and bombed here. In about an hour, when the Iron Birds proudly turned their tails and returned, more than one hundred and twenty buildings here had become ruins, more than one hundred and fifty people had become blood ghosts, and about two hundred townspeople had suffered painful injuries...</p>
<p>He took me, from this street to that street. Next to each bomb mark, I rested for a few minutes and took out my diary to record it in detail. When I wrote those recorded words, my heart felt as if thousands of ants were gnawing at it. You innocent and kind dead! How can I write out the heavy mood of grief that I felt for you at that time?</p>
<p>When I came to the open space by the seashore, my friend said to me in a low voice:</p>
<p>When this friend said this, his voice was also a little hoarse. He couldn't bear this great sadness in his memories.</p>
<p>However, what about me? At that time, I was more angry than grieving and couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"The × Japanese are equal to wild beasts. Even if it is an old and weak woman, they do not hesitate to expend countless bullets! They are the same everywhere!"</p>
<p>For more than a month, this place has been washed by rain many times, but it still cannot wash away the bloodstains! This small river is hissing and flowing, but it can never wash away the bloody memory in people's hearts: "March 30th"!</p>
<p>1939.5, in Taicheng.</p>

<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>If ordinary people want to succeed in any undertaking, big or small, they inevitably need some ability. This ability, generally speaking, is what we call economic talent or competence. From cultivating oneself and managing one's family, to governing the state and bringing peace to the world, it is indispensable.</p>
<p>Within this ability, however, it can be further divided into two types: one follows the official road, sticking to the rules, walking in a square and proper manner, which can be said to be "following the Way"; the other only cares about the goal, disregards the means, and is willing to use any trick, which can be said to be "the way of the hegemon." Morality and the way of the king are praised and practiced by ancient sages and kings, and should indeed be implemented, allowing things to happen naturally. But unfortunately, in my opinion, this way of the king has never been truly implemented throughout history, or rather, it has never succeeded. If we look through history, we only see the way of the hegemon.</p>
<p>Which "founder" of each dynasty, who established the throne, did not fight their way up with swords and spears, or seize power through conspiracy and usurpation? What is this if not the way of the hegemon? Once they become the ruler, they may indeed implement benevolent governance and promote the way of the king. However, if we examine their psychology, as well as that of their descendants, how many of them truly love the people? Aren't they all trying to preserve their own private property and empire, and therefore have to borrow the grand image of ancient sages and kings to suppress their people, and use so-called sacred scriptures and virtuous teachings to promote the great principle that when the ruler commands the subject to die, the subject must die, leaving the people unable to move? Things like revering Confucianism and promoting literature, or promoting education, are nothing more than policies to fool the people, to make them properly support the rulers and not rebel, with the same effect as burning books and burying scholars. What kind of way of the king is this? Isn't it still the way of the hegemon! Gaining power on horseback is the way of the hegemon; even if you can't govern on horseback and try to govern after dismounting, it is still the way of the hegemon.</p>
<p>If the world and the state still only have the way of the hegemon, then it is no wonder that society and families only pursue the way of the hegemon. In other words, in these places, there is no need to pay attention to proper economic talent or competence, only to tactics, because tactics inherently have two aspects, which are the two sides of the way of the hegemon:</p>
<p>First, ruthlessness. Holding the power of life and death, for those who resist, no mercy. If there is land to be scraped, scrape off several inches severely; those who beg for my pity, banish them outside the gate; to those who plead with me, don't give a penny. It is best to make people suffer from you, unable to speak out, or make people afraid of even seeing your shadow, forced to avoid you from afar, allowing you to charge straight ahead, alone and unopposed—all of this is the ruthlessness of tactics, enough to help one succeed.</p>
<p>It is really no wonder that tactics cannot but be ruthless: think about it, even a noble "article" requires a "ruthless hand" to "write" it. And repaying great kindness with evil, killing to silence, has always been a common occurrence, let alone ordinary matters! How can it not be ruthless!</p>
<p>Second, deception. Since ancient times, war has been based on deception, and war is a major state affair. Therefore, the power of deception also permeates all "affairs" and "undertakings." If it were not for Zhuge Liang's seven captures and releases, using the advantages of deception, how could he have achieved "the southern people will never rebel again?" I often hear the elders advising their children, "Only tell three parts of what you know when you meet someone," which can be taken as the essence of deception.</p>
<p>Originally, in complex society, or perhaps in civilized society, honest people and those who are upright invariably have the reputation of being "fools", ending up in utter failure. On the other hand, those with strong tactics, who can use tricks to dazzle people, flourish like sunflowers in spring. Therefore, the best way to handle things is to set traps and let people willingly enter or fall into them. As for what you want from them, never tell them honestly. I only seek from him a certain goal, requesting his help.</p>
<p>A person skillful in ruthlessness can succeed, and one skillful in deception can especially succeed. If ruthlessness and deception work together, then they can go anywhere in the world and be invincible.</p>
<p>When I think about it myself, it is not a biased view: Confucius, who spoke of the way of the king, what was his life like? Even Mencius, who spoke of the way of the hegemon but leaned towards the way of the king, what was his life like? And people like Liu Bang, Zhao Kuangyin, and Zhu Yuanzhang, which one of them truly studied the books of Mencius? Furthermore, what was the outcome of Jesus, who preached the great Way? And which of Hitler and Mussolini's followers were truly devout Christians? Therefore, I say that the way of the king has never really existed; if people treat me with the way of the hegemon, I will treat them with the way of the hegemon. At least for now, that is the true and eternal principle!</p>
<p>"There is nothing inherently wrong in the world, it is the mediocre who trouble themselves." This is the relationship between the way of the hegemon and the use of ruthless and deceptive tactics. Helplessly, everyone in the world is mediocre, so using tactics is the only way to trouble themselves. To trouble oneself is, originally, the only way to live.</p>
