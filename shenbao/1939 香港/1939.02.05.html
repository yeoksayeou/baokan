<h3 id="c1">吾國戰時工業應走之途徑 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 胡錫山</p>
<p>自抗戰開始迄今十九個月，各工業之自戰區遷向內地，及在西南各首新建者，為數匪少，此言為吾國抗戰中之一良好　象。蓋欲加強抗戰之力量，首要乃乃在　全國國民總生產量之增加。蓋一國政府之執行　職務。所使用者，並非是　幣，而是裨上的物質與勞力。在平時狀態下，政府固可自每年國民的所得中，取得定額　幣收入，以購入所需之物資與勞力。故平時國家財妙之來源，可基國民的收益，所得以及消費之上。但國家一旦進入於戰時的狀態，則其所需之物資與勞力數倍於平時，而其需要之性質更屬急不容緩。在此種情態下，政府欲應付道環節，則絕不能全賴之於租稅。而應盡力的利　國內的一切資源，加增全國國民的總生產量，以期待得大量的物資，來供應戰時的一般需要。</p>
<p>在吾國目前的情形下，日×　用其經濟與武力；　管齊下的企圖摧殘吾國的一切經濟事業。在各戰區中它佔奪了吾國的市場與一切資源。同時利用武力將各戰區中所有的工廠，强佔硬霸，　就京滬一帶言，吾國百分之七十最新的人規模工廠，已被損毀或佔有；吾國所有工業　包括天下，上海，無錫，南京，廣東，武漢等地所有之生產機　，亦已被全部消滅。蓋日本唯一的企圖；早想把中國整個生產能力全行消毀。而使中國抗戰上的物資所需，整個的依賴於國外的輸入；同時，它更促事　來破壞與阻止外來物資的輸入，而使中國失卻其長期抗戰的力量，一切均在日人把持　縱之下，這一種企圖，在事實上，雖屬一個夢想的政策；但，在目前中國各大城市及經濟　能為日人惟毀與侵　之下，倘吾國不速謀車行　設及力　經　生產力之加強，則實　入日×榖中了。</p>
<p>故加强生產　　實爲吾國目前之急務；雖吾　自開戰以來，一般生產乃源源不絕的在後方發展着，但依吾國現今的經濟機構而論，這些並不能充分地來適應整個抗戰的需要，所以，吾們認爲大規模的發展小單位制工業，於中國目前的情態下，實應有推動的必要，什麽是人規模發展小單位制工業？透切的說：就是全國在抗戰期中大量的建設小資本單位的實　生產。這一個政策的目的，是要在全國的區域內，散佈地建設起巨數的生產單位，來奠定長期抗戰中的經濟基礎，同時以補　戰區中所損失的一切生濟能力。</p>
<p>實際上，來推動這小單位的實業生產，理由絕非單純的基於欲加强一般的生產　　，擴大一點的說，是爲着適應吾國抗戰上整個部份的需要，此點，吾人可從下列的各點以分述之：</p>
<p>（一）小資本工業最可取之一點，乃籌設上較利便，此可從二方面分析之：在資金力面：以人民一般的投資心理而說。在戰時的狀態下，私人的投資者，對於大規模實業之投資。往往認爲是一種冒險，是爲必然之現象，而對於提出其一部份的資金來從華於小資本的工業上，則事實上比較可能，同時更可使社會上一部份游散的資金，引導入止當的生產事業上。其次從設立上言之，建立一個大規模的實業，在平時尙多困難之點：何況於戰時，不論動　與機器之設計，原料之取得，技術人材之征第等種種問題，勢必加倍的困難，而小資本工業，則以簡便易舉爲前提，故易於解决上述各項的問趙，且可儘量的利用各地的資源，作爲生產之　　。</p>
<p>（二）蓋欲大量生產以適應巨額的需要，而以大規模的工業集中於一地，則造成×軍佔領及轟炸之標的，使此等生產之組織。失其安全的保障。且一旦在必要，不易遷移，例如京滬，武漢各地之各工廠，因機件之不易遷移而遭受很害者，爲數在十萬萬元以上，故爲欲避免此種的損害及保持生產的實力，則不如化大爲小，於內地各處大量的設立小規模的工廠，此不僅可維護整個的生產力，且可建立一個將來　　發展上的堅强基礎，蓋吾國一切金融與實業之組織，向集中於少數的城市，，內地雖資源蘊藏，而人口稀少，荒凉非凡，此種不平衡之現象，爲吾國歷年來經濟上，所潛伏的一大危機，今日卽可利用小單位之實業組織，在這些求　開發之區域內，建下一個據點。日後即可以此據點爲根據發展而擴大之，同時更可以聯合若于的單位，依其地域的分配而建立爲一强力的工業中心，則寸僅在計劃上可統籌一切，且爲未來的生產建設上，開闢了一條穩固而實在之途徑。</p>
<p>（三）小單位制工業之推動，可直接的對軍事有接濟的效用，因其能供應抗戰前綫之需要。蓋設立大規模之工業，須採用重大的機械，僱用大量的勞工，必須以　大的廠房建築以容納之，方能從事生產，故必須建　於後方安全之區，此種工業，其於能至上言之，固可構成政府所計劃的實業機構，而完成各部重要　給之生產，然其不若小規　工業之輕易而台於移動的原則，得設立於附近、綫的各區域，蓋於戰地之前綫，所需各種物質上之供給殊大，且大都具有急需之性質，但事實上則往往因運輸不便而又阻等等的原因，很難從後方應其所需地之迅速供給。在此種塲合之上就很需要在前綫的近區，設立直接供應的單位，以利軍事之接濟。這種要求，大規模的實業，就很難合乎條件，而獨有小規模的工業可適應之。</p>
<p>（四）大規模的推動小資本工業，可解决吾國當前的難民問題，蓋吾國自戰事爆發以來，因戰區之擴大，難民與日俱增，故今日難民之給養，已成爲吾國一嚴重問題。據估計目前全國至少有五千萬至六千萬的難民，陷於困苦的情境，其生活完全的　於政府或其他社會團體的維持，像這一種事實的存在，對于政府社會均有直接的損害，蓋　巨　的難民非僅是失其生產能力，且浪供以巨額的消費，且日後難民的增加，尙有繼續不　的可能，設長此以　，實不利于吾國長期抗戰之計劃。在大量小單位　工業推動之下，這些浪費着的勞動力，便有了生產的可能，同是，每月歡百萬元的難民給　之需，亦可利用於生產之途　上。</p>
<p>（五）小單位工業制度，可充任發展農村經濟組織之中心，蓋由於大量人口的向內地各農村的遷移，各荒凉之　，一旦　成爲人口　集之地，物質需要，頓時大增，然於自給自是的農村中，何來此巨額的物質以供需要？在此情狀下，則洋貨與　貨之乘機輸入，自　難免，而小資本工業的散佈於各地，則可隨地生產而應當地需要，繁榮荒凉之區，開發市塲，以振興農村經濟，同時更爲防止洋貨劣貨輸入的一條有效的警戒綫。</p>
<p>綜上數點，可明推動小單位制工業，對吾國抗戰計劃上，實有奠大的利點，且於今日各重要都　之經濟機能爲×人摧毀之　。吾國對此更感有急切之需要。</p>
<p>應當怎樣的的推動這一個計劃，此亦爲吾人所應討論之　。夫欲建立巨量的小單位—業，實爲一偉大之計劃，絕非一朝一夕所能期實現，所以吾們希望　二步一步的按次序　　行之。爲求推動上的利使。最初富有一基本之組織，來作爲推動之中心。　個中心組織的首步工作，當舉辦一個槪　的調査；這一個槪　的調査，句括二項工作：一爲估計或調査目下物資需要之性質以及程度，蓋不明需要情形，試問將回以供應其需要？故此爲一確定應生產之基本目標。根據此目標，亦卽可確定應有之生產類別，依其重要而審核　緩急，加以調劑。其二當依地域之分配而調査各區資源之分佈情形，而分劃各單位之設立。有了這二個具體的目標，也就奠定了建設之基礎。同時，政府當運用激勵的方法，促進全國人　擴大投資於小單位工業之意志，並運用種種積極的方法，予以籌設上的便和協助以及保障，而使這一個正當投資的泉源，得以順利的推行。</p>
<p>有了具體的目標，確定了淮行的計劃，同時在推行之管理上，亦當有一完備之組織。以爲統制及指導之中樞，使各個小單位在一體的行動下，獲得合理而良好事。茲分述統制及指導應有之點，略抒意見：</p>
<p>蓋統制者是以一團體之力量與方法，而　單位活動的種類，及範圍加以根本的管理是也，小單位　工業的分配於各地，股不加統制，則勢必造成散　而小統一之現象，對小單位制工業統制之入手，有二個原則：（一）生產上的統制，（二）原料上的統制。生產上的統制：是在使各單位之生產，其供給與需要之程度能和　應，以防止不需的浪費以生產的不半衡，同時更須促進單位生產之　　化，此并僅是指每　單位當標準化，而欲促進整個單，生產的　　化，蓋標準化之切效可使：（一）生產正確，（二）以少數之種類，而獲巨　的產量，使適應戰時的需要，（三）製品之事務可以簡單，而製品之完成可迅速而精良，（四）因生的標準，則原料及製造費的浪費可以減少。</p>
<p>關於原料上的統制，其重要性當過於生產蓋戰時生產以軍需爲上，故原料統制上的第一個原則。須使軍需品之製造，其原料當有優先，使用權，如中　兩工廠，其所用　同一原料，但乙工廠爲普通工廠，而甲工廠之　　爲供軍需之用。於此二者之下，則當使甲工廠對該原料獲得優先之使用權，因戰時對於軍需工業之原料，若不加統制，而使重要之生產獲得優先之使用權，卽對軍事上之妨礙殊大。試舉　戰時之美國爲例：蓋美國於　戰後，對東部工　地方，定下軍需品及軍需原料六萬件，於此巨額的物品中，其對於軍事價値有大有小有急有緩。但因缺乏統制之故，其中往往軍事價格較小或需要較　者，反得先行生產。而其中急不容緩之軍需品，反因原料之缺乏，而不能製造。以致美國當時的戰時生產，陷人極端混亂之狀態，故際比非常時期，吾國對原料之絲制，實不能忽視，否則影響所及，對軍事上之妨礙非淺也。</p>
<p>其次指導與改善亦頗重要，蓋指導是一種合理的啓示。改善便是前進的出發，於此戰時狀態下，爲求全國國民總生產量增加，政府對於生產及原料旣有糾制之必要，則對於生產內部之一切亦應予以指導及改進；此可別爲作業·組織·勞動·機械·　部份，關於作業上：（一）作業方法的合　指導及生產技術的改進；（二）作業分工與合作系　連絡之能否適台；（三）對於作業時間休息時間應予合理之分配指示；（四）人與工程間能率之　絡。關於組織：（一）組織系統之指導，（二）工務事務之　分；關於勞動方面：（一）改進工人生活之實應；（二）工人動作之指導；使工人動作　單純，疲勞減輕，而求工作效率之加強。（三）從工人製造缺點上的發現，而予以方法上的改善與指導。歸納言之。際吒非常時期之下，加强生產機構，實爲吾國當前之急務，大規模發展小單位制工業之生產，其重要性實與，企業相同，日其可取之　，實勝於人企業，而　切台戰時環境，故推動小單位制工業，實爲吾國今日戰時工業建設上應有之途徑。</p>
<p>【編者按】推動　單位制生產建設，的是要圖，但尚有兩點，似爲筆者所忽略，（一）爲小妙機器之獲得，蓋小單位制生產建設，是爲慮大工業遭×人之把待，或未適應內地生產之情况，故其性質爲介　於和工業興機器工業之間，惟此種機件，如何製造，從而獲得，亦爲　單位生產建設之先决條件。（二）日×所佔領之　域，多爲城市，故在城市之工業，常爲所霸占統制，若欲不爲所利用，只有移轉於鄕村去。然在鄕村建築起小工業單位，保護而孕育之者，有賴於游擊軍。假加游擊軍不能負此責任，結果，仍將爲人所霸佔統制去，此亦値得深慮長思也。故游擊軍之責任，不僅爲破壞對方工作，又在保護游擊區內人民財產，助長其建設，以爲異日民族工業復與之基也。</p>

<h3 id="c2">新的世界大戰　（上） <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 陳友仁</p>
<p>陳友仁先生這篇文章，對於下次的世界大戰，詳加討論，頗有獨到之見，言人所未言，這文承陳氏交本報與中華時報同時發表。　編者</p>
<p>英首相張伯倫先生從明興會議的「戰陣」還抵英京的時侯，曾志得意滿的宣告天下，自認其在明興的努力，已奠定了這一世代的和平，作，辭幾天，香港的人們又親聆着他要求其國人努力使英國得到充分的戰時準備的廣播。張氏旣這樣的要求，那末，未來的大戰，也許是「下次的世界六戰」——是否行將來臨？</p>
<p>關於這問題，請在下面詳加討論</p>
<p>（一）一個在醖釀中的革命運動</p>
<p>當我去歲行將離歐歸國的時候，我嘗欲求一簡單的原則，以概括我親目　見，思維所得的四方民的生活和遠東民　當　的動態之相互關係。我認爲有一個顯著的「典型」，在控制着現世的一切的變動，在支配着各民族的物質的，精神的，和社會的鬭爭。我認爲這一切的一切，都是一個在醖釀中的革命運動的表現。　運動。在一方面，是一般生活不滿足的人們要求獲得經濟上的安全的運動；在另一方面，是其他的人們爲着窮苦的民衆要求『社會公道』的運動</p>
<p>如今這個醖釀中的革命運動猶如注國當年的大革命。法國的大革命，是因爲受××否　帝皇有奉天承命實行苛政之權而起革命的鼓勵，遂發動民衆力量，變更歐西社會的政治組織，而使個人得獲享受政治上的自由；如今的動，也許是受着蘇俄否認「私產神聖」的革命的影響，其使命將在令歐洲及歐洲以外的社會，發生機構上的巨大變動，而使個人在經濟生活方面，獲取安全的保障。</p>
<p>（二）獨裁領袖發動的戰爭</p>
<p>但在追個要求經濟的安全的巨大變動中，如今却發現着一個新的爭戰。這戰是發於若干民族的需要和慾望。而這些民族，一方又受着一種適應於戰爭而不適應於和平的一貫的思想　　的煽動，另一方更受着其領袖開疆拓土的野心驅使。因爲這些民　的需要和慾望實爲國際社會的現存資本制度所生的必然結果，那些所謂「饜足的國家自應與「不饜足的國家，共同合作，重將世界的資源，作公平合理的分配。如果每一個民族國家中的個人的經濟安全須要保障，則國家本身的經濟的安全，很顯明的更須要保障。</p>
<p>（三）國際合作和經濟的自給自足</p>
<p>關於這種世界經濟的重新分配，不獨其實行的條件，如今已大致具備；即實施這種分配工作的中心組織，亦可運用國聯代之但最不幸的是英美近年來政略上的重大錯悮，遂使那些懷抱權力與領土食慾而又具有戰　的意志和工具的獨裁領袖們，得在今日的國際局勢中，處於策略上的主動地位。因此，就很自然的令德意的領袖得拒絕經濟合作的建議，而假借經濟自給自足，以實行其經濟的戰時動員。（未完）</p>

<p>興教所以救國　救國乃能保教　白在渝囘教歡迎會演講</p>
<p>【重慶通訊】在這次偉大的抗戰中。出現了一支全民族一致的鐵軍。任何什麽經濟上，思想上、宗敎上的分對完全　打破了，這中　値得重視的是擁有四千多萬敎徒的回胞，又因爲有一强的英明的領導，更加嶄然而露頭角。最近他們在「與敎所以救國，救國乃能保敎」的口號之下，組織起來了，這就是「中國囘民救國協會」的產生。一月二十九日該會爲歡迎理事長白　生先生，在渝市淸眞寺舉行了一個盛大的集會。</p>
<p>白先生在全場熱烈的鼓掌聲中，與大家　立致敬中步人會　。</p>
<p>白先生　黄呢戎裝　白手套，雙目炯炯有神，令人望而敬畏，他說帽向大家爲禮，露出了光亮的頭頂。白先生身負重任，日理萬機，十數年如一日，在此我們可見他怎樣爲國家民族勞神苦思考啊。</p>
<p>他的演講分兩部份，第一部份是一年半來的抗戰經過的報吿，他用確切的事實，簡單的理由。懇　的詞句，如談家常似的勉勵敎胞，要　瞭事實，要自情自重要自救救國。第二部份是就宗教本身的情形加以敍述，這裏更殷勤地。不嫌煩瑣地，反復地提出了，加緊囘民的組織訓練工作的理由，他有看極可重視的指示　啓發。</p>
<p>在第一段　，他以事實引證日人在軍專上，政治上，經濟上，外交上各方面失敗，興我們的勝利、他以極有定的　句說「現任我要老老實實吿訴大家，我從來不說假話的，我决不敢欺騙你們，抗戰一年半來，我們是　戰愈强，我們巍然的中華民族，絲毫無損，而且比前更偉大了。第一從精神方面說。我們絲毫不屈，前方將士，從沒有投降的，後方的民衆顚沛流離沒有抱怨的，這種「死　不屈，勞苦不怨」的精神，×人是不能滅亡我們的，第二是政權，我們雖陷落了許多都市，但我們的政權依然存在，如江蘇韓代主席，山東沈主席，山西閻主席，安徽廖主席，浙江黄主席，…他們行使職權仍舊無所阻礙，如此日人企圖消滅我們，眞正佔領我們的土地也是辦不　的。事三透兵力，從七七事變開始到現在。我們的軍隊要多三分之二。人數較前有多無少，素　也比前更好，因此日人夢想消滅我主力，也完全不可能。所以大家應該　　覺悟、我們支持持久戰。不出三年，必可獲最後勝利。」</p>
<p>這一段話白先生已講了一個鐘點了，天色慢慢昏暗下來了，然後白先生又引到第二個問題「宗敎本身的問題」說得更加懇切，更加具體，更加有力，他對于敎友真不愧是一位賢明的領　袖猶家長對於他的子第。他說：「現在中國囘民救國協　的組織，不是爲了找私人的出路，爲了營私舞弊，爲了升官發財，要救國才能保敎，要敎胞都明白這個理由，一致振作，有了共信發生力量來救國。而不是掛一塊招牌不是成立一個機關。本會的工作就是「組織」與「訓練」。宗敎組織是最自然的最堅强的，只要再加以科學方法的整　和運用，就可以成為抗日救國有力的團體」。爲什麼要組　？白先生道時引用一個　　四座的例子，他說「比如現在我們在此開會，如有土匪殺來，大家便將手足無措，甚至爲躱避而自相踐踏。但　如是一連乓就不然，即三四百上匪，也可打退，因爲一連兵有連長可以指揮抵抗，我們要組織便是這個理由」。「訓練工作也極重要的，不加訓練則不懂抗戰的方法，救國的途徑。因此要抗戰建國必從組織訓練做起。「這時全場聽衆由屏息而熱烈的鼓掌，彷彿光明的大道，敞開在自己的眼前。</p>
<p>還有一點很重要的是他教明了「前方」與「後方」的關係，一要向前才是生路，向後使是死路，宋明的向後撤退終至亡國，×人是可以直　我們的後方的，但是我們不讓他進來，我們猛烈抵抗他，他就不靜逼我們了，我們不要怕接近×人，愈怕愈加　志氣，最近據江蘇韓主席　吿，他在前方。有好幾個月不見×人飛機，可見比重慶還安全，安全的地方是到處有的。不論在前方後方、只要大家方寸安定，必定心安理得、這才是項安全的地方。現在×人後方，我們還有幾十萬軍隊，而且都是最好的軍隊，所以我老老實實告訴大家，前方要比後方安全。」</p>
<p>他又關懷着數，萬教胞的文化生活與經濟生活，他希望能够逐漸提高改善。他希望敎胞裏頭能　產生新的人才出來，魚更多更大的責任，他說「培養幹部」「造就靑年」是極重要的。</p>
<p>最後白先生又報吿了囘民參加抗戰的工作，爲成立救國組織，赴西北喚起八百萬敎　。近東訪問團的出國，西北公學的設與成達師範的創立，這些學校造就的師資，一面司以做校長，同時可兼敎長，務達宗教與敎育的合一，增强宗敎的力量。白先生對青年的殷切，對敎胞的摯愛，任何人是都曾感動的，白先生還希望今日到會的敎胞能够把他今日的話去轉吿沒有到會的人，或者寫信告訴他們，務使幼實產生信仰，發生力量。</p>
<p>白先生演講畢已六點十分鐘了，卽由廣柯三致答詞，勉大家在最高領袖蔣委員長的領導下，一面興敎，一面　國。</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>（本報倫教特約航訊）</p>
<p>上一篇通訊裏，記者會指出沙　特與英國英格蘭銀行總裁諾曼　，近一個多月來所進行的幕後金融談判，對於歐洲本來整個形勢發展的重大影響，現在，沙　特被希特勒免職的消息，忽然出現在全世界人們的面前了。</p>
<p>不用說，希特勒這種舉措，對于英國是一個嚴重的示威，引起英國各方面的震動。今天和昨天晚上所出現的一切英國報紙上，這消息，都被放在了最重要的兩位，大多數都有著縝密的社評。然而，看一般的語氣，還是把它歸之於德國國內　金融原因，而巧妙地省略了這一舉措在國除關係上的意義；但不安的情緒，在那字裏行間，是分明流露者的</p>
<p>照今天此地的消息，沙赫特的國家銀行總裁位置，是免去了；但、他算還保留了『德國砍府中一員』的地位。這是說，在這裏，希特勒還替央國留下一個談判妥協的門徑；隨時隨地，還可軍行談判。假如英國受不了希特勒的大聲恫嚇，願意以金融上讓步。取得德國的歡心，以企暫時茍安的話，那未，她還是可以通過沙赫特而那末做的，不過，看起近　的各種形勢發展，希特勒的這個夢想，十分八九，難以達到目的。</p>
<p>去年年底沙赫特倫敦之行完全沒有達到他預期的目的，而悄然歸去的時候，當時，德國內部的一此急進份于，對他，就起了很大的不滿；可是當時他的辯解是：雖然這一行毫無結果，但希望並未斷絕。因爲他巳經和英格蘭銀行總裁約妥，在最近的將來，還可軍行談判，接着，他就擬出了種種關於維持德國金融的計劃，其中最重要的，是所謂問英，法索還歐戰後德國的賠欵，當爲未來談判的取有力的論據。果然諾曼的　國之行，是提前實現了。然而，就在這次談判的過程常中，却另外生出了枝節。就在這個時候，英國政府，忽然確悉了希特勒和莫索里尼聯合日本。在本年度內擴張的計劃和準備；同的。英國外交部，得到了一個情　知道：縱使西班牙的佛朗哥　勝，意大利的軍隊，也絕無撤退的準備。間樣情形下，是說，德國以沙赫特博士爲代表而進行的談判，實際上，對於德國的野心，絕無牽　的作用。於是，爲了提防諾曼的讓步太快，英國政府立刻採取了好幾個步驟：首先，英外相哈立法克斯，趕緊通知諾曼吿以英國對德妙策的臨時　急　定，希望他不要作具體的讓步，最好時，即可以私人旅行的名義，完結他這一次的德國之行；其次，英國政府，立刻發出通令，制止任何直接或間接的對德放軟，最後一個最有力的一著，是立刻宣佈，即日起，把大約在二萬九千萬這樣數量的金子，由英格蘭銀行。移到另一個國家金融機關裏去。這　步驟一來，諾曼和沙赫特博士間正在進行　談判，立卽擱了淺，變成全無意義了。</p>
<p>英國的這　舉措。當然的，引起了希特勒重大的忿恨，而决定加以報復，？結果，就是這突然而來的，掛著助謂「緩進派』招牌的沙赫特博　的免職，而繼任的，却是那個向外急進擴張經濟勢力的功臣　　。</p>
<p>僅僅就經濟方面說，德國的這　舉動，實上，對於英國，絲毫不起什麽威　作用。縱使目前喧囂一時的德國市場擴張計劃加　，縱使德國一切止在計劃中的經濟計劃施行、然而，英的經濟專家們，却堅决地扣信一接事實：德國的經濟情形，確巳經到了山窮水盡；至於未來的路，如果不放棄和英國的軍備競爭，那末，經濟機帶根本崩潰，是注定了的。</p>
<p>不過，沙赫特免職的最大意義，還是在於政治方面。沿着這個路綫走下去，大槪那個醞釀已久的禁止英，法擴張　備的恫赫，不久後，就會拿出來了　【一，廿七】</p>

<p>汪的　歐果成事實，則我們還須有幾個基本認識：</p>
<p>第一，汪的赴歐，絕對不能代表中國政府或民衆作何活動，我們還要喚起國內外各界嚴密注意其言行，汗若一日不悔禍改過，一日不放棄其主張，卽一日不能洗去其××面目的羞辱。</p>
<p>第二，汪縱赴歐，亦不能謂汪氏叛黨賣國投降事件的結束，因爲失敗主義者，仍在高唱『和平』『反共』的論　，自甘充任日本侵略者的別動隊；而潛伏的親日份，更在各種巧妙的掩護之下，伺機活動。我們不能因爲汪的遠引，而忽略了或鬆懈了　奸工作。</p>
<p>第三，汪縱赴歐，但汗的宣傳機關及其私人走卒仍舊散佈在國內外各地，甚至將變更其活動方式而逞其陰謀。更是我們所不能漠視的。</p>
<p>不過汪的失敗是已經確定的了，今後汪的任何行動亦必不能有所成就，甚至要恢復其舊日的掛羊頭賣狗肉的政治地位亦不可得了！我們希望一切悲觀論者，失敗主義者，拿汪來做敎訓，我們更希望從前盲目附和汪的少數人士。引汪爲前車之鑒，大家積極起來，擁護中央，加强團結，堅持抗戰，共爭中華民族解放的最後勝利！</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>抗戰國策是本人一貫主張</p>
<p>黨國先進現任監察院副院長許　智先生，近奉中樞電召，囘渝相任要職，搭着美國郵船公司的柯力芝總統輪，趕程南下，遄往重慶。昨天，許先生乘搭的郵船，安然抵港，記者趨輪訪謁，爰將所見印象，約略記：</p>
<p>中午時分，搭着尖沙咀的渡海小輪，在江心裏，早已望到了黑身紅烟突的柯力芝總統輪，在綠波裏慢慢的爬進着。到得九龍倉碼頭，巳經黑　的站滿人了。杜月笙先生，這天穿黑大衣　絨長衫，脚踏黑緞鞋，和孔令倪毛源和等名流，站在一旁，閒適的說着，不時仰着勃子看着那迎面而來的郵船。</p>
<p>柯力之輪纔靠岸，鉄行　輪又　着啓行的汽笛，橋頭站滿了依依不捨送行的人，橋尾却立着滿懷歡欣接船的客，接船人讓送船的人過後，纔鬨着的跑上前去。到了船的辦房，拿起搭客的人名錄，一査却沒有許先生的人名，那可然費思量了。幾個同業和着許先生的親友分頭的尋找，有些來接船的，還說着：「許先生沒有來呀！」畢竟杜月笙先生一干人領着路，在一個梯口裏找到了許先生。</p>
<p>來接船的人，都趕上前握手，這着寒喧。許先生非常興奮而又誠懇地立在人蔣裏，一一還禮道謝。別來無恙，許先生穿着米黃色的西服。精神異常　旺，又充分透露他數十年來爲黨國奔走的閱歷和毅力。</p>
<p>他和應酬的人談的是上海話，但碰到了記者又轉囘了他　流利的廣東話來他說話老是帶着笑，當記者開始和他談話的時候，他一聽到是記者，便疊迭連的點頭說：「啊！請等等」。便趕緊的敎隨從拿出他那書面的談話。那書面談話中寫着：「抗戰國策旣經中央嚴正宣示，崇智向來一貫主張不外乎此。但冀國人切實聯合，共赴此的，崇智必當蜴其棉薄，敬從國人之後。崇智分屬軍人，無多政談，但終身爲總理三民主義服務，期保持我國權，與我民立於世界平等地位而已」。雖然寥寥數語。許先生的愛國熱忱已表白無遺了！</p>
<p>問起先生在香港逗留多少時候，他說是說不定。</p>
<p>據某關係方面說：許先生這次赴渝，是參加五中全會所議决組織的最高國防委員會會議，共策杭戰大計的。</p>

<p>昨天中午十二時，該　在孔聖堂舉行第一屆畢業典禮。</p>
<p>『今日的兒童是將來的主　翁』「把兒童從艱苦中救起來」　『難童學校是社會的學校』『國難一日未了，國民責任一日未完』『……』警惕的標誥貼滿了禮堂，說明了該校間辦的動機與目的。記者和招待員的談話中，亦得知該校的一般情。</p>
<p>該校的。生多數是在×人炮火下逃難到港九的貧苦失學兒童和本地的　苦無力人學者，總共人數有四百來人，分爲六區授課。計：香港區楚在中環普慶坊第二十四號三樓。西　盤第三街一五二號一樓。灣仔大道第八十六號樓，九龍區是仆：旺角上海　第六七六號一樓。油蔴地吳淞街一五〇號二樓，和深力　大南街一六一號三摟。</p>
<p>這個難童校是由茶居工會的義學擴充起來的。經費由谷界熱心人士槪捐，該校葷如文東軒，文耀揚，凌康發，劉祟起，凌樹動等襄助尤力。現在每月的開銷費是一千元左右，敎職員六處約共三十人。學生入學不　免收分文，書籍用　亦由該校供給。</p>
<p>開　至今已經半年，編制方面分爲高初二級，高級相當於三四年級初級相當於一二年級　上課時間是在晚上，課　與普通小學差不離，還有戰時吊識，很注重抗戰意識的訓練。這次高級班畢　之後，還擬再招新生。並希望多訓練一些謀生的技能。</p>
<p>據該校校長開會時報吿：「香港的難　數目，統計讀數萬以上，請各界僑胞贊助難童敎育。」我們亦馨杳禱祝像這一類的義務敎育能够在慈善家與熱心人士　力之下，廣泛地展開起來。這不僅是慈善事業，亦是替國家民族的復興，奠定了根。</p>

<p>三種主要秀質</p>
<p>胡春冰：所謂批評，和一般誤用了含義不同。從前的批評，大約可以分成兩種，一種是老先生的八股說敎，和「念背打一的戒尺，卽如前幾年所謂進步的批評都是如此。一種是謾罵和攻擊，只能釀成藝術界的無政府的混亂，卽如上海香港小報的文章、差不多都是對人的暗箭。我們要建立的批評，卽是在行動中建設理論，我們可以說，淮步的批評，他本身其有三種特質：（一）進步的批評是工作的檢討。我們這倘時代不需要（而且也不能够產生）和藝術部門實察工作沒有關係，只曉得引經據典　　褒貶的游離的批評家，我們的批評家要在工作者中產生，批評是自我批，，工作檢討，是作爲整個藝術界自我敎育中一個重要的節目。忠實地報吿實際　作的情形，系統地調査並整理整個活動的物的條件從工作的困難與缺憾的克服中，指示出史進一步工作路線與方式。發動第一個工作者參加批評　動，把批評做成整個藝術活動有機的一環。（二）進步的批評是建設的，他本身是一種鍾作活動，批評不，金科玉律的覆述，而是活動——工作　驗必然的累積，重新通過批評家的思緒體系而再造出來。他的確是一種創作，這種創作不是破壞的而是建設的，不是漫和　的而是親切的，不是死扳的而是Active的。這種批評不只是藝術活動客觀的批判，而且是主觀的活動的一種努力。（三）進步的批評活動是基礎理論的引伸和深入的生長，同時是藝術活動指導理論建立的基石與Originalaerm（菌）。戲劇電影的批評，不能離開社會生活，所以，社會的准步的思緒方法與現實的材料，會是批評的『後台』，但　種批評，却不只是結束舊現實便了，他要　建新現實，指導理論就是創造新現實的指針。所以：批評活動必須同時是組織活動。</p>
<p>華南的　影戲劇批評都還沒有建立，我們要用批評的活動來加强工作的效能，促進工作者的團結，爭取史廣大的羣　認識，接受，擁護進步的戲劇與電影！</p>
<p>標準不要太高</p>
<p>費穆　關於電影戲劇批判，我覺得很簡單。我不想多談理，說說一點老實話，批判就是檢討，檢討的工作是要我們實際去做，但不要提着太高的標準。對於有毒素作品的批判我以爲無須太干嚴怡地採用攻擊的態度，有時候應該原諒其苦衷。</p>
<p>這次討論對象是中藝今次演出，我以爲應集中來討論。中藝這次的演出，技巧超過內容，實在値得我們敬佩。我還要提議請中藝報吿這次是怎樣演出的，使得大家的批判，有所根據。</p>
<p>避免一般批評</p>
<p>司徒慧敏：我以爲電影戲劇批評的問題並不如費光生講得那麽簡單，特別是電電批評，因爲我是一個從事影影工作者，從抗戰—幾個月來，尤其是×軍南侵之後，我所感覺得在工作上發生種種應該解决的問題，應該是給實影批評發生不可分的密切　擊的。表面上看，似乎很簡單的電影戲劇批評問題，但實際上，在此地電影和戲劇工作，有計多不相同的地方，、比如內容上，最近從許多的公演中很明顯的看到就在檢會通過上戲劇是比電影沒有那麽嚴格，許多比較更有意　更正面的作品都能公演，但是，電　就很困難，幾個月以來，所見的儘是一些跟抗戰毫無關係，或甚至於不利於抗戰的東西，另外一方面是戰事西移之後國內市塲縮小，一般製片商拿這個作爲轉向的理由。所以我們存這個時候。得赶緊决定做怎麽樣的作品，一方面爲了使它有抗戰意義，另一方向又得爭取在各地的公開放映，要做到這一點，電影批評定該起很大的指示作用。這一點是很要緊的。</p>
<p>還應該　別指出的，我以爲許多所注意到的電　戲劇批評問題，是一般化的，而沒有在意到×我對抗形勢下的雷影戲劇批評特別是在外人統治下香港的由影戲劇批評，在　裏隨時可以發生×人文化的攻略戰，隨時可以愛釗種種制限，所以我們的工作亦成爲戰時的，隨時以各種方式出擊，並且也可以　受到制限而致於變史戰略，影批評和我們的工作是不可　的，　能配合抗戰，他不該如一般的批評刻扳形式，歐陽予倩關于克服影戲劇的公式化，我除贊同蔡楚生先生意見之外，還有一點補　：電影戲劇的演　有時候上曲線勝於直線，側面勝於正面，使觀衆看了之後就有了一種感覺，就會想到某一個地方去。現在，在抗戰建國的過程中，凡是艱辛奮鬥的各個門活動事實，如山洞讀書，建築公路，雪地上與×人奮鬥……無一不是電影戲劇的題材。不一定很，械地一定要拉出一個×人出來打一頓痛快。或是有一隊游擊戰士，才叫做國防劇。蘇聯的電影風行全世界。他們的片子並沒有機械地標示階級鬬爭宇樣，但是，觀很自然地就生了人類的正義感。這就是一偭明顯的例子。現在，凡是暴露醉生夢死，貪官污吏的罪惡者，使觀衆覺得與自己發生關係，亦都是戲劇的題材。不要超出『抗戰建國』這個最大的目標就是了。</p>
<p>爲什麽要用曲綫走側面呢？就是因爲藝術本身有它的娛樂性，從聲音，樂噐，色澤，曲折的故事……等藝術的原素，引人入勝，使劇情劇旨　作者到觀衆，發生親切的關係。</p>
<p>這是我們應該走的路，做不成功別觀，可以再來幹，路是人走出來的。</p>
<p>爭取廣大觀衆</p>
<p>譚友六　關於建立電影戲劇正確批評的討論剛纔已經有許多位先生發表過完善而實貴的意見。我現在所能提出的不過是點補充的材料而已。我們知道，一宗畢物若是沒有絆過批評是不會有改良和進步的；電影與戲劇當然，需要眞切的誠懇的批評來增加它後來的成就與生命。在電影，戲劇的製作人（包括編，導，演，以及具他各部門人才）之中　我們可以把他們分爲兩部：一部是『向上的』，他們對於自己的件品永遠不會滿意，永遠迫求着進步；另一部是『自滿的』，他們狂妄地自信其作品是『盡善盡美』，沒有人能與之比擬的。前者正是「求知若渴」，若是他們作品出來之　沒有批評，他們將感到懊喪與悲哀，他們不惜千方百計去探聽觀衆的意見，和去找志同道合者請敎；而後者却不然，無論有如何眞摯的批評出現，對他們的作品有無限貢獻，他們也「不屑一顧」甚且還要盛氣凌　地罵那些批評者「多事」或是「有得撈」—根據上述的兩部分製作人的態度决斷來，我以爲正確的批判不單應該建立來和「向上的」商討，給「自滿的」以教訓，必要時且不恤予以擊，同時還　該運用樓種方法寫到　普通的觀衆　爲之發生興趣纔成。爲的電影與戲劇不能沒有觀衆，而觀衆中，尤其是華南的，儘多人云亦云，甚至糊裏糊塗，根本不懂得分別一部作品的好壞的。假使批評的文字和內容寫得活潑有趣而不是板板六十四只討論着專門的技術問頭的，則其效力自然地可以普及到一般觀衆，無形中灌輸給他們以欣賞　影，戲劇的知識。觀衆旣然有了欣賞的知識，則對於精心製作的作品自然趨之若鶩，反之粗製濫造的東西必然將受顧客的唾棄而不能續現。　括一包：我們要建立正確的批評，而下確的批評這要川種種引人入勝的方法來寫，使它不單對　影戲劇有本有身貢獻。而且必須做到爲好的作品爭取更多的觀衆。</p>
<p>配合民族鬥爭</p>
<p>連貫：從整個文化運動看來，我們的鬥爭應該不斷的加强。作上文化運動一部門的電影戲劇運動，在兮天建　正確的批評，確實是非常必要的，並且是急切的，因爲批評就是鬥爭的武器，我們應靈活地運用在目我育上，指出我們的方針，確定我們的步驟，檢討本身的弱點，糾正一般的錯誤，暴露一切臭惡的姿態，打擊與肅淸所有危害民族的奴化毒素，我想我　對於這一工不要看做一樁小事情，也不要以爲很簡單的問題。其實在民施解放鬥爭中、一切工作都是困難的，　我們只有不怕困的精神堅决支持下去，任何困難那可以克服的。我們必須認淸，×人正用着各式各樣的陰謀來阻碍我們文化的前進與向上，企圖銷滅。我們的民族生存，電影界，在此際正有着一部份落後的昏庸份子在幇助着×人所要做的工作。因此我們要提高政治的警惕性，不論何時　地，事實上我們是一貫的站在敵對的崗位上戰鬥着我們不我　×人×無情的打擊。將會給×人打了下來，這是很明顯的事實。我們首先要團結集中自已的力量，加强和促進這一鬥爭的發展，把電影戲劇運動配台到整個民族解放動中去。</p>
<p>三點重要結論</p>
<p>陸浮：對建立進步的電影戲劇批判這個問題，蒙各位發表了這麽多的寶貞的意見，歸納起來，我們已經有了幾個重要的結論：第一，我們批判的基礎，是應該建立在民族解放鬥爭上面的，我們要　據抗戰形勢的轉移而確定我們的需要、同時，要配合起當地的環境與對紮。我們的標準　該是廣義的，生動的，而不是刻板的口號公式。第二，我們批　的態度，是建設的，創造的，是嚴正的檢討，而不是惡意的攻擊，是誠懇的糾正，而不是高調的　。我們固　要擁護一切進步的電影戲劇，同時亦要用我們的血誠，親切地去鼓勵和喚醒一切落後的電影商人和　影工作者的醒覺。第三，我們批判的方針，是　盡力去克服一切的困難與缺點，指示出更進一步的工作路綫與方式，同時爲要加强工作的效能，應該極力去爭取　大的觀衆，使每個有智識的觀衆明瞭怎樣去選擇良好的精神糧食，使我們的批判工作在觀衆中起了作用，發揮偉大的力量。這三點結論，可說是我們這座談會第一次實　的收穫—因爲時間的關係，這問題現在這里我們可暫作結束，以後，就是我們應怎樣實際的去執行這批判的工作了！</p>

<h3 id="c47">一九三九年的國片　和「人類的呼聲」！ <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 劍心</p>
<p>從「八一三」戰車爆發以後，中國電影業的主力軍所在地——上海，因爲事　事後缺乏整個的策劃，所以一九三七年的末幾個月，便完全　入停頓狀態，也因爲這一種突發的　盪，使在上海的工作者，有機會散佈到國內各地去，以及一部份人先後到香港來，——來找尋新的材料。新的工作環境。到了一九三八年初，上海電影界是從突然的僵死中，漸漸的蘇醒過來，但，不幸這　蘇醒，竟是變本加厲，差不多在和所謂「粤語片』並駕齊驅，互爭短長。而來香港的幾個導人，還能愼重將事，對他們每個人的戲，都用長時期來籌備　待機而動。一九三九年　便是他們動的時機，除了司徒慧敏是先後完成了他榮譽的「血濺寶山城」和「游擊戰進行曲」，並且和譚友人兩人已經在準備今年的新今片，而明年一月間將要開　的，便有蔡楚生的「孤島之堂」「南　風雲」和費穆的人類的呼聲。</p>
<p>關于「南海　雲」，本刊已　介紹過，至於眞光公司的「人　的呼聲』，是一部有絕對時代意義的影片，它需要絕大的魄力，和集台超水準的物力，人力，和財力來完成這一個雄圖。</p>
<p>它的編劇人是『人道』「天倫」的作者鍾石根，導演是費穆，演員陣綫包括上海方面的張翼，黎灼灼，黎鏗，香港方向的吳楚帆等人、這僅是取主要角色的名單，其餘大量的優秀演員，都在羅致中。担任攝影的第一流攝影師周達明，其他工作人員也都是上選的幹才，預備在較長的時期裏，來創造這一部特殊的影片。</p>
<p>我們不僅是說：在一九三九年可以多看到許多有良心的優秀影片，而更可注意的，是這一個好的力量將和　他內地的影業好的力量，將給予國產影業一個絕大的影嚮，而造成一種新的覺悟，使另一部份電影力量，發現一條新的道路，而共同邁進。</p>
<p>最後，我們必需聲明的，我們不惜爲新生的，有良心的，不放棄責任的東西來做宣傳，因爲宣傳是報紙的任務，能爲好的東西盡且傳的力量，我們更覺得光榮，並且希望產住更多可以宣傳的東西。</p>
<h3 id="c48">「時代」最近的工作 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 黃雲</p>
<p>——本月十日起舉行大規定公演——</p>
<p>香港的戲劇運動，自從抗戰開始之後，巳從一般努力戲運工作者去苦幹，和受了外來的劇團所影　，似乎已走到漸漸開展的路上了，過去一年來的演出成績，也就可算是香港劇運今後開展的序幕。</p>
<p>一九三九年的開始，已由『中藝』二次公演及港九各青年業餘劇團聯合大公演；而形成了。一九三九年香港劇壇的空氣緊張　來各，　劇團也忙于籌備公演，這實在是目前新興藝術一　很好的現象。</p>
<p>名戲劇家歐陽予　領導下　以粤語演出的『時代劇團』是由本港一般靑年的話劇前　盧敦　所組織的，他們過去很能夠苦幹。過去的成績也很好，聞　他們第一期工作（定期性公演）至第五次結束以後，適歐陽先生來港，因此，再　劃過第二期的工作，由歐崇予倩領導，已在去年！二月間開始排戲，它們第一次的上演已於本年元月在澳　舉行了，一連　演了五天，聽說成績極好，收入出不少。自從它們回港之後，即行籌備在港來一次大公演。最近筆者遇害『時代』的同志，據云：它們近幾人來日夜的趠緊排新戲，決定於本月十日晚起一連四天年九龍普　戲院上演，作爲第二期第就次擴大公演，四天所演的戲也不同，而且其中三個是新戲，都是他們　近所排好的。</p>
<p>第一天演　　　旵先生的『原野』，這個戲在　港是第一次上演，過去也沒有其他劇團演過，而且，它們去年曾將這個劇本改編過電影劇本名『世代冤仇』，現作才　好，也是最近公演的。這次所演的人物也和『世代冤仇』和一樣，導演也由李　清，　李晨風二君合作。想演出的成績定當不弱了，因爲他們對　劇本已有一年多的研究的了。</p>
<p>第二天日戲是『原野』夜　的也是曹　的『日出』，這劇本過去已由『中旅『在港上演　的了，不過，用粵語來上　這個戲的，在港還是第一次，　時代』演這戲也是第一次，導演是由歐陽予情先生擔任，並且多加了南國影星吳楚帆君參加演出。</p>
<p>第三天日塲演『日出』，夜場是一個很有意義的諷刺喜劇。『新官上任』，這個戲『時代』在澳公演時候是最受一般觀衆所歡迎的，而且，我們在上一期有　文章介紹過，聞說，這戲是『時代劇團』自認爲得意之作的，經歐陽先生苦心排了兩個多日，這樣看來，這個　當然　們最好的一個吧？</p>
<p>第四大所演的是一，他們曾演過數次的『　雨』，過去所演的成績也不差，也許是　了要將曹禺的三部完　的演出，而卑選這個戲吧。</p>
<p>『時代劇團』能够不斷地　續着這苦幹的神去工作，這是我們所敬佩的，不過我們很熱望它們不　是爲戲劇而戲劇，同時也更多做點救亡的戲劇，爲救亡而戲劇。尤　　希望『時代』負起你們做哨兵的責任，去打開一兒三九年香港劇運的新路。</p>
<p>劇運動態</p>
<h3 id="c49">尤競新作—「花濺淚」中旅加工排演中 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>在抗戰戲劇的出產中，尤競的作品無論在一質一的方　，或是「量」的方面，都楚相當豐富的；最著名的如「夜光　」，已被全國各地的劇團普　地排演，香港也已有了多次的演出。大家都認爲劇作者的意識，技巧，詞藻各方面都是十分圓熟優越的。</p>
<p>「花濺淚」是尤競最近的作品而以『干伶這筆名在上海刊印的，內容　描寫舞女生活的痛苦，暴露都市罪惡的成因，指示靑年正當的出路，是一部適合時　要求而又適合上演的佳構。</p>
<p>自然，因爲環境的限制，有些地方水敢充份寫述，正如他自己在序裏所報吿的：「有些地方胆子太小，語焉不詳，殊不痛快！」然而那是沒有辦法的事，我們除了替困居「孤島」的同志們怨惜之外，也只有像作者所希的「我們能語焉詳，痛且快的時候，當在不遠了吧！」　同樣的　祝！</p>
<p>聽　中國旅行劇團自從「分家」而經「重建」完成以後，就開始加工排練這簇新的「花濺淚」，聞該團　長　該劇導演　槐秋對于它的上演有相當的自信，認爲Carl整　，『噱頭』豐富，一定會比『夜光杯』更有味；那末，應當可以有更好的收穫了。</p>
<p>筆者看了這劇本以後，感到濃厚的興趣，謹先作這樣一個簡單的報道。</p>
<p>新生的鐵流劇團</p>
<p>自祖國抗戰轉入一嶄新的第二階段後，反映在救亡文化的一環——戲劇。在香港也有急激的展開和優秀的工作紀錄。最近，九龍半島的靑年戲劇工作者又組了一個『鐵沭劇團』。它是在『和生活事業』打成一片，忠實抗戰的原則下產生的，這幾天在各報的徵求欄里那可以有到『鐵流劇團』徵求同志的廣吿，從這點充份的業現出他們—作的不關門，而企圖廣集一切忠實的戲劇工作者們，共同創造光輝的劇運，據該團團長九几九生稱：『鐵流』目前已開始排演工作，不久將來準　出演的劇目有：『民族萬歲』『女子公寓』『我們的故鄉』及『日出』云。</p>

<p>立春佳節、　限風光、球國　民、正好乘時遺興、今天裏、足球　項、有特別銀牌賽、也有聯、都甚重要、不是等閒、　信各場演出、定然悅目可觀、</p>
<p>銀牌、是東方對南華華、這筆球賬、因在前次算未消　、致有今天再决雌雄、且　大戰結果、是誰要　淘汰出局、</p>
<p>記得前次對壘、南華先獲兩球、佔居優勢、怎料林德譜隨　受傷、不良於行、逐無呈折了中流砥、戰局隨之而變、東方乘機收復失　、打個二比二平手、造成尙無結　　戰事、　那次兩隊因求勝心　、　出不成樣子、　人印象很　、希望在今天、兩隊球人須以體育精神爲依歸、莫冉有那次的過火行爲、辛甚幸甚、</p>
<p>今天東方仍以戰勝南華南那次一樣的人馬上陣、至於南華則略有變動、前次爲戰東方面受傷　林德譜、迄今還未全愈、將用楊根保代任中　、又以區士諤出替前次戰東方　被罰　賽的李碩友、因此、整個陣綫、不像　次完善、</p>
<p>關於勝負問題、我不欲先下　語、因爲同是華隊、無論誰　、都一視同仁、總求發揮眞純技術以爭取勝利、才是良能、若不道德之勝利。則不足取也、</p>
<p>聯　　　對士葛、亦頗重要、但未悉士葛的演出、能否冉像前次、如其又奪去每軍一分、　南華南　間接上實受其利、光華對聖約瑟、亦工力悉敵世、</p>

<p>【本報　訊】上海學生網球隊蒞港業已多日、昨日下午二時生首次逢戰香港大學隊於港大球場、計賽三單打兩雙打、鏖戰　六時許始異、結果五對　、學生隊全勝、茲略述各　戰情於後、</p>
<p>第一單打</p>
<p>上海唐寶嘉對港大王錦熙、唐氏爲上海華人本年單打冠軍、膂力過人、球藝精良、王氏　港大魁首、身體巧　、球藝究差一籌、速非「撲克」對手、開　後、王除先獲發　局外、卽爲唐連下五城、土再增一局、迭成五對二、唐即以六對二結　第一　、第二盤、唐挾　盤　威、先獲兩局、王　艱　之局面、追成二一　平手、至是、唐手下不留情、大刀　斧、　氣呵成西局、再以二對　獲得第盤、費時僅半小時、</p>
<p>唐寶　　六——二　六—二　王熙錦</p>
<p>第二單打</p>
<p>滬全國潘對港大馬超　、李亦爲滬上華人名手、與唐寶嘉有瑜亮之組、昨李不善革地、故昨日表演未能發　全力、第一盤即爲港、馬超壯以六對四攫去、　一盤開　、馬先獲首局、李造成二對　、馬追成二二平手、李突大發威力、一鼓作、連下四局、以六對二奪回是盤、第三盤最後决勝、開始後、李仍一路領先、馬　緊之追　、由各二各一各四而成五對　、李以一局先佔、馬冉追成五五平手、李伺機續下兩局、乃以七對五獲得最後勝　、</p>
<p>李國潘　四——六　六——二　七——五　馬　壯</p>
<p>後三單打</p>
<p>滬韋鎭興對港王顯壁、雙方球藝伯仲、打來　爲接近、第一　各以發球獲　、　以一步佔先、以七對五先勝、第二盤相持如故、一再平手主四對四時、　加緊壓迫、巧以六對四獲是盤、最後一盤、王已略呈疲態、　則愈戰愈勇、一路領　、再以六對四獲得勝　、</p>
<p>韋鎭興　五——七　六——四　六——四　王顯羅</p>
<p>第一雙打</p>
<p>滬唐實船李國璠對港王錦熙馬超壯、雙方打來難分難解、第一盤苦鬥十八局、唐李始以、對八獲勝、第二盤中、唐李略疏忽、以爲王馬以六對三扳成平局、第三盤開賽、　方均已精疲力盡、勉力應會付、唐李終以藝高一着、體力　佳、再以六對三完成、業、</p>

<p>娛樂—富家女的祕密</p>
<p>There　Go　es　My　Heart</p>
<p>是一部美國　的笑日、故　的取材與及情節的編排、完全是爲達到喜劇的目的、導演出奇制勝的手法、在本片中給觀衆制作了不少新鮮的笑　、劇情的瘋狂諧趣、也很有引人人勝的力量、</p>
<p>片中描寫一個不經世故而渴慕自由的富家　的出走、同時怎樣的與一個記者在特　的形淸之下發生　愛的故了、</p>
<p>弗德立馬區和薇琪尼白羅絲、都不是很高明的諧角、　片中沒有什麽成就、演出平平而已、潘倩凱莉明朗爽快、倒有很出色的表演、是一個可愛的丑角、南錫卡洛、飾演一個虛榮嫉妒的女店員、這是她重囘銀幕的第二次演作、成績還不　、</p>
<p>皇后周映……</p>
<p>平安……英宮六十年</p>
<p>Slxty　Glorious　Yearg</p>
<p>本片同是寫英女王維多利亞一生的光榮史蹟、不過較前一部更爲詳盡而已、將她在位六十年中許多重要的功績、都包括在內了、爲鄭重與畢眞起見、特由英國皇家公司攝　、却多少帶一點宣傳英國女王　史的色彩</p>
<p>因爲素材特別豐富、而那種素材都　寶　、不容得擯去或删去、那麼在這種情形之下、導演是不容易討好、及處理得當、本片就犯了這个毛病、全劇除前半部寫女皇婚後生活、稍見生動活潑　外、有後半部祇妤　割據歷史片段、作爲機構的介紹已、　也不能怪導演的手腕了、</p>
<p>全　有幾個很優越的場面、如女皇婚後的生活、英國皇家軍的衝　、女皇舉行　禧紀念及後去看她的老宮女　、都値得提起的、演員方面、同前一部「英后偉史」沒有都大更動、飾女皇的安娜尼格兒、　出絕佳、尤其是在老年時、飾阿爾伯親王的安東華爾勃羅、也極優秀、</p>
<p>東方……及筓年華</p>
<p>That　Cert　afn　Age</p>
<p>這裏所描寫的是一個早熟的少　、她竟戀上了比她年紀大一倍　的記者、他起先並不知道、及後發覺是這麽一會事之後、極力想使她絕念、都不生效　、結果還是由另外一個女子來解了圍</p>
<p>無疑地、狄安娜寶萍在　本片中是更見得美麗了、不但是演出上的細膩與活潑、有着顯著的步、男主角茂文陶格拉斯、非常稱職、像『巧女歌聲』裏的馬勃赫歇一樣、賈　古栢、仍留露着天眞的演技、</p>
<p>裏頭四支新歌、亦頗動聽、</p>
<p>大華……瑞士小姐</p>
<p>Swfss　Mfss</p>
<p>老　哈台折移前最後第二部台滑稽片、故事寫二個賣　軋的商人（老萊哈台）、一次他們到瑞士去做生意、二個自作聰明的獃子、就閙了不少的笑話、有些地方果然是欠强、但也正爲是喜劇的緣故、</p>
<p>裏面尙有二個歐洲的歌唱家、參加表演、尤其是那個女子的歌很好、兩個賣貝的演出、同以動沒下兩樣</p>
<p>新世界……摩登女招夫</p>
<p>粤語片</p>
<p>就是舞上的『摩登女招夫』所改編、劇情是叙述一個　產百萬的富翁、　吝異常、對於一切公益事業、非　一毛不拔、反要想出來佔人家便宜、這時因爲各界發起籌　建立華民—業　、想睛　帮　、可楚結果他非　沒有拿出一點錢　、反而在會議席上、沖了幾件西點、於是衆人設法想出這『摩登女招夫』的辦法來、想他來上當、再用女色來誘　　、</p>
<p>主處是舞　紅伶、馬師曾譚　　、也是　片家　生意眼</p>
<p>關於導演的手法還相當淸</p>
<p>中央……烏衣隊</p>
<p>粤語片</p>
<p>本片中所表現的、是社會中兩個懸殊的階級、一方面日勞苦的婦女大衆、另一方面　　一些有閒階級矯　淫　的老爺少爺們、但是導演對於各個情節的描寫、未免過　達到「香　」的目　、而忽略了現實的表現、同時也爲了太求「香艷的緣故、益使全片充滿　低級下流、調情胡閙的意味、</p>
<p>劇情描寫一　弱息女子、夫往外洋謀生、家　不良、迫她往外傭工、而受盡種種的　侮壓迫、及夫榮歸、又發生種種誤會、</p>
<p>半部情　鬆弛、且大部份以歌劇的形式演出、企圖掩飾內容的空、導演手法廿嫌不够洗鍊、但是女主角黃　麗、在本片中出色的表演、是不能埋沒而　得讀、的、</p>
<p>太平……粤劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>
<p>日演……命裏生成娶賊婆</p>
<p>夜演……皇宮雙燕</p>
<p>普　……粤劇</p>
<p>興中華劇團</p>

<p>（甲）心跳過劇、頭暈目眩、</p>
<p>（乙）呼吸困難或喘息、</p>
<p>（丙）用九時身體或四肢感　抖震、</p>
<p>（丁）胸部貨肋部感覺刺痛、</p>
<p>這種情形都是運動過　劇烈的表示、如再勉强　續、卽能引起　動過度的弊害、</p>
<p>至於運動過度補救的方法雖然很簡單、但總是預防容易補救難、況且及至需要補救的時候已太遲、我們的身體巳受相當的相害、</p>
<p>茲將預防運動過度的方法分條列舉於下：</p>
<p>（一）運　時以出全力的百分之六十至七下五爲限、但這祗　指平時練習的時候五言、在競賽的時候或約每隔兩星期、可以有一次出盡全力來運動、</p>
<p>（二）精神不振時切勿勉強運動。</p>
<p>（三）運動時間和運動程序要有一定的規定。</p>
<p>（四）運動時姿勢要正確、動作要澈底。運動如過於劇烈足　影　姿勢和動作。</p>
<p>（五）運動時不可停止呼吸。</p>
<p>（六）患神經衰弱、　臟病、貧血、失眠、　消化、便秘等症　人不可做劇烈的運動、或須完全停止運動、</p>
<p>補救的方法除了休養和糾正運動的錯誤外、深呼吸運動和、水浴或熱水浴也很有效、行深呼吸運動時一方面能吸入大單的　氣、一方面能將＂酸氣澈底排出、使血液潔帮、循環作用正常和活躍、於是心臟與他部主要的器官都　　強健起來、我們的身體也就易於復原、温水或熱水浴能使身體鬆弛、對於患失眠、與貧血等症的人都有很　的助凈、但熱水浴也不可過度、否則身體更爲衰弱、冷水浴對於身　有很大的　　　、　身體起很大的反應、　於身體　弱的人是很不適宜的、此外、　弛運動（Relaxfna　exerses）對於患運動過度的　也很有益、　之運動過　補救的方　主要的就是强　心臟和神經系統、使循環呼吸、消化等作用正常和活躍、（下）</p>

<p>友秋</p>
<p>在革命的時代，進　的時代，一方是革命的隊列　然前行；另面是『沈滓的泛起』，憎。這新時代的曙光，眞理的炬火還未照通，一些人又會欠缺了他的應有的自覺，甚至革命的隊列。『也時時有人退伍有人落荒　有人頹唐，有人叛變』魯迅）。這　定着在進步的總流免不了有殘存的退步和黑暗，而在某一特珠部門甚或顯現了退縮，倒流。不過，這是一個顚撲不破　眞理，一切事物，總是依循『無窮的　低級　到向上高級的過程』，『在它的面前任何東西都，能抗拒的』：『雖然有時也有表面的偶然和暫時的倒退，但歸根結蒂仍是向前發展』，這是思格斯底話。</p>
<p>問題是在這個「倒退」會不會影響于向上運動呢？無疑它會使這運動發生遲滯，當我們回歸到抗戰這現實課題時，更要淸楚在每一個分的部門的「倒退了，不但作用于其本身，而且影響到抗戰這總運動的進程，使它有了威多或少的遲滯。</p>
<p>問題是在任這個『倒退』應如何克服呢？現實是迫切地要求着這　服，當我們精細地考察，透過『倒退』的　象，就必然地　發得到　向前發展的平　。要發　　向上的質，去打倒那『倒退』的量，產生的『奧　充變』過程，在這裏，我想要強調調工作克服的意義，『向上』的與『倒退』的　着相反對而又相競爭的過程，我們就在這工作的鬥爭，競賽的當兒，便能夠打破　『倒退』的根據，奪取了它的根據，在廢墟上建築撙的建築，惟有　工作去克服。然後可以使『沉滓』們喪失了武器，重　沉沒在時　的河床，然後可以使欠缺自　者獲得他們的新生！</p>
<p>以上是作了一個一般的探討，讓我們拿現實的東西來分析，在藝術上的諸部門，文藝，音樂，戲劇，電影等賦有了特定的向上的運動的新質，但我們却容易發現了一個倒退的　象在電　界中。正如蔡楚先生指出的：「除了在政府的中國電影製片廢和中央電影攝製廠在英勇地負擔了光輝的任務之外，蓬　一時的電影文化運動，無分南北，都全在進了毀滅之路了』。這　誰也感覺得到了的，然而我們應該分析這『倒退』的現象，就只能承認它是「表面的暫時的　然的』，電影文化運動具有了向前發　的新質。一二八以後的進步電影就是由于工作的競賽和鬥爭，才退了神怪　俠的退步性電影；然而爲抗戰這一急激變動，神怪武俠電影便因了民間故事片血借屍還魂，做了『倒退』，進步的電影反因客觀環境而退縮，我們要克服這『倒退』，還是要恢復以前的工作競賽和鬥爭！這意義在於爭取觀衆，養成觀衆對于美惡的正確的分辨，才可以粉碎沉滓們站脚的土台，才可能使不自覺者接受了現實的敎訓與喚起了『自我批判』。打倒毒素電影固然是從批刺出發，但需要以製作進步的電影來完成！這工作的克服不過是說明『理論與實踐的統一」吧了。</p>

<p>— 秦佬</p>
<p>好幾年以前，有些批評家曾經主張過文學家是可以一手開槍，一手寫小說的。但後來終出於不出那樣的天才，纔證明了只是批許家在說夢話。自然，傳說上曾經有過馬上吟詩的作家，但吟詩是可能的，寫小說可　行，而且　出的詩也不會是『偉大』的詩。理由很簡單：小說最需要『藝術描寫』，而作家要眞的去做『　寫』的工作，却多少要有一些事實上的條件。</p>
<p>巴比塞底『火』，不是在大戰的當時寫出來的；電馬克底『西綫無戰事』，也不是在大戰的當時寫出來的。就以目前西班牙戰爭來說，始終還留在西班牙的作家就沒有見寫出『不准敵人通過』那樣『報吿文學的　作』。荷蘭底名作家耶夫。拉期特（Jegf　Las）到西班牙去參加了戰爭，却只寫了　篇通信，—自然，那倒可以說是『好的報吿文學』的，然而也不是『不准敵人通過』那樣『報吿文學的傑作』。</p>
<p>雖然就是並不「偉大』的報吿文學，却也還得經過一般寫作的兩種過梯：首先是要有一報吿一的　料：目前材料自然遍　都疋，但　着却是要有坐下去寫成一文學』的一點時間，換一句說話，便是不「信筆直書一的一點時間。要是文學不要坐下的一點時間便可以寫出來時，那纔眞是『神秘的東西』了。現在住在上海　香港的作家自　是有一些的，他們也許有安心寫作的時間的　，但　却畢竟是少數，而目也未必都是一向　專門從事於　文畢』寫作的人。在我想來，「十八個月來一老實　在　加戰爭的文學作家，村料固然是用不完，但坐下去的時間却一定是很少的。</p>
<p>我並不是說，目前的報吿文學就應鼓是一流水賬似的，缺乏藝術的描寫，沒有感人的力量」我只是說,目前對於在鬥爭綫上奔走的作家、且不必責備得太嚴.有「不准敵人通過」那樣『報吿文學的傑作』自然是最好，倘是沒有，只要有眞實的通信，眞實的紀事，只要是還用着文學的手法。而且還不算是壞的作品，就都不妨權目認　是過得去的報吿文學。那些作品能一有聲有色一，能『精采』，自然也是最好。但是這兒然而老作家又往往不肯像他們那樣上前線，有一個事實問題。十八個月來參加戰爭的多半是些靑平作家，當然技術大槪不免差一些。或者因爲要　備將來的『傑作』,不願意寫那些通信和紀事，這使是沒有法子的事，所以我們只有暫且用那些不算『有　有色』，也不算『精采』的作品滿足一下自：再說。但這也只是暫局：那些作家會很快地用他們動人的生活把他們「筆尖下」的「故事」化爲「有聲有色」，也化爲「精采」的。</p>
<p>所以我以爲，要是因爲「簡直很少看到好的報告文學」而「不免要感到一點慚愧」，那應該不是籠統地替一般的作家「慚愧」］而應該替幾個落後作家「慚愧」纔對。（在這兒預先留下一句回答別個反問的話罷假如我也是作家，我承認我也是　不掉的一個）。</p>
<p>至於說到「將領訪問記之類」太多，這我倒認爲是　實的忠吿，和將領合　一張　像，請將領題　個宇或一首詩，接着自己也和一首。再鄭　地用銅版製了出來，結果都是和報吿文學不相干的。「訪問」自然　重要。但我以爲最好還是多去訪問一下士兵。從土兵底周圍一定可以得到更重要的村料，那材料一定能够使訪問者寫出『好的報吿文學』，雖然並不一定便是「偉人的報吿文學」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Path Our Nation's Wartime Industry Should Take <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xishan</p>
<p>Since the start of the war of resistance, now nineteen months, many industries have moved from the war zones to the interior, and new ones have been built in the southwest. This is a good sign in our nation's war of resistance. To strengthen the power of resistance, the most important thing is to increase the total national production. The instruments a government uses to perform its duties are not currency, but material goods and labor. In peacetime, the government can obtain a fixed amount of currency income from the annual national income to purchase the necessary materials and labor. Therefore, in peacetime, the source of national finance can be based on national income, profits, and consumption. But once a country enters a state of war, the amount of materials and labor it needs is several times that of peacetime, and the nature of its needs is even more urgent. Under such circumstances, the government absolutely cannot rely entirely on taxes to deal with these circumstances. It should do its best to use all domestic resources to increase the total national production, in order to obtain a large amount of materials to supply the general needs of wartime.</p>
<p>In our country's current situation, Japan is using both its economic and military power in an attempt to destroy all of our country's economic enterprises. In the war zones, it has seized our country's markets and all resources. At the same time, it uses military force to forcibly occupy all factories in the war zones. Taking the Jinghu area as an example, 70% of our country's newest and largest factories have been destroyed or occupied. All of our country's industrial production machinery, including those in Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuxi, Nanjing, Guangdong, Wuhan and other places, has also been completely destroyed. Japan's only aim is to destroy China's entire production capacity, so that China's material needs for the war of resistance will depend entirely on foreign imports. At the same time, it is also working to destroy and prevent the import of foreign materials, so that China loses its ability to resist for a long time, and everything is under the control of the Japanese. In fact, this is a dreamy policy, but with major cities and economic arteries in China being destroyed and invaded by the Japanese, if our country does not quickly plan for new construction and strive to strengthen its productive capacity, then it will truly fall into the trap of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Therefore, strengthening production is indeed the urgent task of our country. Although our general production has been developing continuously in the rear since the start of the war, according to our country's current economic structure, these are not enough to fully adapt to the needs of the entire war of resistance. Therefore, we believe that the large-scale development of small-unit industries is truly necessary to promote under China's current circumstances. What is large-scale development of small-unit industries? To put it bluntly, it is the large-scale construction of small-capital unit-based production enterprises throughout the country during the war of resistance. The purpose of this policy is to spread the construction of a large number of production units throughout the country to lay the economic foundation for long-term resistance, and at the same time to compensate for all the economic losses suffered in the war zones.</p>
<p>In fact, the reasons for promoting this small-unit industrial production are by no means simply based on the desire to strengthen general production. To expand on this, it is to adapt to the needs of the entire war of resistance in our country. We can discuss this point in detail from the following aspects:</p>
<p>(1) The most valuable point of small-capital industries is that they are relatively convenient to establish. This can be analyzed from two aspects: In terms of capital, based on the general investment psychology of the people, in a state of war, private investors often consider investing in large-scale enterprises as a risk. This is a natural phenomenon, but it is actually more possible to contribute a portion of their funds to small-capital industries. At the same time, it can also guide a portion of the idle funds in society into appropriate production enterprises. Secondly, in terms of establishment, it is difficult to establish a large-scale enterprise even in peacetime, let alone in wartime. Problems such as the design of equipment and machines, the acquisition of raw materials, and the conscription of technical personnel will inevitably be doubled in difficulty, while small-capital industries take simplicity and ease as prerequisites, so it is easy to solve the above-mentioned problems, and local resources can be used as much as possible as the basis for production.</p>
<p>(2) To produce in large quantities to meet huge needs by concentrating large-scale industries in one place creates a target for enemy occupation and bombing, making the organization of such production lose its safety guarantee. And once necessary, it is not easy to move. For example, many factories in Jinghu, Wuhan and other places have suffered huge losses of more than hundreds of millions of yuan due to the difficulty of moving machinery and equipment. Therefore, in order to avoid such damage and maintain production strength, it is better to transform large into small and establish a large number of small-scale factories in various parts of the interior. This can not only maintain the entire productive capacity, but also lay a solid foundation for future development. All financial and industrial organizations in our country have always been concentrated in a small number of cities. Although the interior is rich in resources, the population is sparse and desolate. This imbalance is a major crisis lurking in our country's economy for many years. Today, we can use small-unit industrial organizations to establish a base in these areas that need to be developed. In the future, we can use this base as a basis for development and expansion. At the same time, we can also unite several units and establish a strong industrial center according to their regional distribution. This can not only comprehensively plan everything, but also open up a solid and practical path for future production and construction.</p>
<p>(3) The promotion of small-unit industries can directly support the military because it can supply the needs of the front lines of the war of resistance. The establishment of large-scale industries requires the use of heavy machinery, the employment of a large number of workers, and the construction of large factory buildings to accommodate them before production can be carried out. Therefore, they must be built in safe areas in the rear. In terms of production capacity, such industries can certainly constitute the industrial organizations planned by the government and complete the production of important supplies for various departments. However, they are not as easy and portable as small-scale industries, and can be established in various areas near the front lines. The supply of various materials needed on the front lines of the battlefield is huge, and most of them are urgently needed. However, in fact, it is often difficult to quickly supply the needs from the rear due to transportation inconveniences and other reasons. In this situation, it is necessary to establish direct supply units in the nearby areas of the front lines to facilitate military support. Large-scale industries have difficulty meeting these conditions, and only small-scale industries can adapt to them.</p>
<p>(4) The large-scale promotion of small-capital industries can solve our country's current refugee problem. Since the outbreak of the war in our country, the number of refugees has increased day by day due to the expansion of the war zones. Therefore, the sustenance of refugees has become a serious problem in our country. It is estimated that at least 50 to 60 million refugees across the country are trapped in difficult situations, and their lives completely depend on the maintenance of the government or other social organizations. The existence of such a fact is directly harmful to the government and society. A large number of refugees not only lose their productive capacity, but also waste huge amounts of consumption. Moreover, there is still the possibility of a continuous increase in the number of refugees in the future. If this continues, it will be detrimental to our country's long-term war of resistance plan. With the promotion of a large number of small-unit industries, these wasted labor forces will have the possibility of production. At the same time, the millions of yuan needed for refugee relief every month can also be used for production purposes.</p>
<p>(5) The small-unit industrial system can serve as the center for the development of rural economic organizations. Due to the migration of a large number of people to various rural areas in the interior, various desolate areas have suddenly become densely populated, and the demand for materials has increased sharply. However, where can such a huge amount of materials be supplied in self-sufficient rural areas? Under this situation, the opportunistic import of foreign goods and inferior goods is naturally inevitable, while the distribution of small-capital industries in various places can produce locally and meet local needs, prospering desolate areas, developing markets, revitalizing the rural economy, and at the same time serving as an effective warning line to prevent the import of foreign and inferior goods.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, it can be clearly seen that promoting small-unit industries has great benefits for our country's war of resistance plan, and with the economic functions of various important cities being destroyed by the enemy today, our country feels an even more urgent need for this.</p>
<p>How should this plan be promoted? This is also something we should discuss. To establish a large number of small-unit industries is a great plan that cannot be realized overnight. Therefore, we hope to implement it step by step in sequence. In order to facilitate promotion, a basic organization should first be established as the center for promotion. The first step for this central organization should be to conduct a general survey. This general survey includes two tasks: one is to estimate or investigate the nature and extent of the current material needs. If the needs are not clear, how can we supply them? Therefore, this is a basic goal to determine what should be produced. Based on this goal, we can also determine the types of production that should be carried out, and adjust them according to their importance and urgency. The second is to investigate the distribution of resources in each region according to the regional distribution, and divide the establishment of each unit. With these two specific goals, we have laid the foundation for construction. At the same time, the government should use incentive methods to promote the will of people across the country to expand investment in small-unit industries, and use various positive methods to provide convenience, assistance, and guarantees for their establishment, so that this source of legitimate investment can be smoothly promoted.</p>
<p>With specific goals and a clear implementation plan, there should also be a complete organization in the management of implementation as the central hub for control and guidance, so that each small unit can obtain reasonable and good results under a unified action. I will now briefly express my opinions on the points that should be included in control and guidance:</p>
<p>Control is to fundamentally manage the types and scope of unit activities with the power and methods of a group. If small-unit industries are distributed in various places without control, it will inevitably lead to a scattered and ununified phenomenon. There are two principles for controlling small-unit industries: (1) Production control and (2) Raw material control. Production control is to ensure that the production of each unit can be matched with the degree of supply and demand, so as to prevent unnecessary waste and unbalanced production. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote the standardization of unit production. This not only refers to the standardization of each unit, but also to promote the standardization of the entire unit's production. The benefits of standardization can be: (1) Accurate production, (2) Obtaining a large output with a small number of types, so as to adapt to the needs of wartime, (3) The affairs of products can be simplified, and the completion of products can be rapid and excellent, and (4) Due to the standards of production, the waste of raw materials and manufacturing costs can be reduced.</p>
<p>Regarding the control of raw materials, its importance should be greater than production. During wartime, military needs come first, so the first principle of raw material control must be to ensure that the raw materials for the manufacture of military supplies have priority in use. For example, if two factories, A and B, use the same raw material, but factory B is an ordinary factory, while factory A is used to supply military needs. Under these two conditions, factory A should be given priority to use the raw material. If the raw materials for military industries are not controlled during wartime, and important production is given priority in use, it will greatly hinder military affairs. Take the United States during World War I as an example: After the start of the war, the United States designated 60,000 items of military supplies and military raw materials in the eastern industrial areas. Among these huge amounts of items, their military value varied greatly, and their urgency varied. However, due to the lack of control, often those with smaller military value or less urgent needs were produced first, while the urgently needed military supplies could not be manufactured due to the lack of raw materials. As a result, the wartime production in the United States at that time fell into an extremely chaotic state. Therefore, in special periods, our country must not ignore the control of raw materials, otherwise the impact will not be small on military affairs.</p>
<p>Secondly, guidance and improvement are also very important. Guidance is a rational inspiration, and improvement is the starting point for progress. In this wartime state, in order to increase the total national production, the government has the necessity to control production and raw materials, and should also provide guidance and improvement for everything inside production. This can be divided into operation, organization, labor, machinery, and equipment. Regarding operations: (1) Guidance on reasonable operating methods and improvement of production technology; (2) Whether the division of labor and cooperation system of operations is appropriate; (3) Reasonable allocation instructions for work time and rest time should be given; (4) The connection between human and engineering efficiency. Regarding organization: (1) Guidance on the organizational system; (2) The division of labor between industrial and administrative affairs. Regarding labor: (1) Improving the living conditions of workers; (2) Guiding the actions of workers, making the actions of workers simple, reducing fatigue, and seeking to strengthen work efficiency; (3) Discovering the shortcomings of workers' manufacturing and providing methods for improvement and guidance. To sum up, in extraordinary times, strengthening the production mechanism is the urgent task of our country. The large-scale development of small-unit industrial production is as important as large enterprises, and its advantages are better than large enterprises, and it is in line with the wartime environment. Therefore, promoting small-unit industrial production is the path that our country's wartime industrial construction should take today.</p>
<p>[Editor's Note] Promoting small-unit production and construction is indeed a good plan, but there are two points that seem to have been overlooked by the author: (1) Obtaining small and exquisite machines. Small-unit production and construction are designed to prevent large industries from being controlled by the enemy or failing to adapt to the production conditions in the interior. Therefore, its nature is between handicraft industry and machine industry. However, how to manufacture and obtain such machinery is also a prerequisite for small-unit production and construction. (2) Most of the areas occupied by the enemy are cities. Therefore, the industries in the cities are often occupied and controlled by them. If we want to avoid being used by them, we can only move to the countryside. However, building small industrial units in the countryside and protecting and nurturing them depends on the guerrilla army. If the guerrilla army cannot assume this responsibility, the result will still be occupation and control by the enemy. This is also worth considering deeply. Therefore, the responsibility of the guerrilla army is not only to destroy the enemy's work, but also to protect the people's property in the guerrilla area and promote its construction, so as to lay the foundation for the recovery of national industry in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The New World War (Part 1) <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youren</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Youren's article discusses the next world war in detail and has unique insights, saying what others have not said. This article was submitted by Mr. Chen to this newspaper and the Chunghwa Times for simultaneous publication. Editor</p>
<p>When British Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to London from the "battlefield" of the Munich Conference, he declared to the world with pride that his efforts in Munich had laid the foundation for peace in this generation. A few days later, people in Hong Kong personally heard him request his countrymen to work hard to make Britain fully prepared for war. Since Mr. Zhang made such a request, then the future war, perhaps the "next World War" - is it about to come?</p>
<p>Regarding this question, please discuss it in detail below</p>
<p>(1) A Brewing Revolutionary Movement</p>
<p>When I was about to leave Europe and return to China last year, I tried to find a simple principle to summarize the relationship between the lives of people in the four directions that I had personally witnessed and thought about, and the dynamics of the people in the Far East. I believe that there is a significant "archetype" that is controlling all the changes in the current world, and is dominating the material, spiritual, and social struggles of various nations. I believe that all of this is a manifestation of a revolutionary movement that is brewing. The movement, on the one hand, is a movement of people who are generally dissatisfied with life and demand economic security; on the other hand, it is a movement of other people who demand "social justice" for the poor.</p>
<p>Now this brewing revolutionary movement is like the French Revolution of that year. The French Revolution was encouraged by the revolution that denied the right of emperors to implement harsh government by order of Heaven, so it mobilized the power of the people to change the political organization of European and Western societies, and enabled individuals to enjoy political freedom; now the movement may be influenced by the revolution in Soviet Russia that denies the "sanctity of private property," and its mission will be to cause huge institutional changes in societies in Europe and beyond, and enable individuals to obtain security in economic life.</p>
<p>(2) Wars Launched by Dictatorial Leaders</p>
<p>However, in this huge change that demands economic security, a new struggle is now being discovered. This war is launched from the needs and desires of certain nations, which on the one hand are incited by a consistent ideology that is suitable for war but not for peace, and on the other hand are driven by the ambitions of their leaders to expand their territory. Because the needs and desires of these people are the inevitable result of the existing capitalist system of international society, those so-called "satiated countries" should cooperate with "unsatisfied countries" to re-allocate the world's resources fairly and reasonably. If the economic security of individuals in every nation state needs to be guaranteed, then the economic security of the nation itself clearly needs to be guaranteed even more.</p>
<p>(3) International Cooperation and Economic Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>Regarding this redistribution of the world economy, not only are the conditions for its implementation now largely in place, but also the central organization for implementing this distribution can be replaced by the League of Nations. But most unfortunately, the major mistakes in the political strategies of Britain and the United States in recent years have enabled those dictatorial leaders who harbor power and territorial appetites and possess the will and tools of war to be in a strategically proactive position in today's international situation. Therefore, it is natural for the leaders of Germany and Italy to reject the proposals for economic cooperation, and to implement their economic mobilization for war under the guise of economic self-sufficiency. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th by this Newspaper] The military focus is still in the Northwest. For a week, the artillery fire at Tongguan and Fenglingdu has not ceased. The enemy attempts to disturb Tongguan, and we retaliate with heavy artillery fire, killing many enemies. It is heard that the enemy commander at the bottom of the town has been driven away. Our troops in Hejin are also engaged in artillery battles across the river.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 4th] According to reliable military sources, the Japanese troops in various places in northern Jiangsu are busy preparing to attack the Chinese guerrillas. According to reports obtained here, the Japanese army is attacking in the southeast of Shanxi with four divisions, and as a result, they occupied Liaozhou, 70 miles southeast of Taiyuan. The Japanese army's offensive towards the southwest of Shanxi Province failed a month ago. The second offensive has not yet been implemented. On the same day, Shen Fu replied that six divisions of troops in Shandong, Hebei, and Chahar are adopting encirclement strategies in an attempt to "eliminate" the Chinese guerrillas in one fell swoop. According to military personnel, even if the Japanese army pours all its strength into attacking the Chinese guerrillas, they can still break up into smaller units and handle the situation properly without being captured. In addition, the Japanese army fired artillery at Tongguan intermittently for two consecutive nights, but there was no change in the situation. Yesterday, Japanese warships and Chinese troops also had artillery battles in Beihai.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 4th] Hua Lian visited Mr. Chang Feixu, and today took a giant Japanese plane from Ping to inspect the situation in Shanxi Province. He crossed the Yellow River to the southwest to Taiyuan, and then returned to Beiping. In Shanxi Province, Mr. Fei saw vast mountains with people living in them. The food, coal, and cotton and all the necessities were unusually sufficient, and the terrain was rugged and dangerous. The Japanese army obviously had no way to attack them. However, the Japanese commander in Taiyuan ignored these difficulties and said that the guerrillas in Shanxi Province would be resolved soon. His deputy said, "At present, we must station heavy troops in all large and small strongholds. After that, we only need to station heavy troops at key points of transportation." This statement is enough to prove that the Japanese army's repeated attempts to cross the Yellow River have been restrained by the guerrillas and have not been successful. The Japanese army's optimistic attitude is not agreed by the personnel of the puppet "provincial government" supported by the Japanese. Taking the situation in Taiyuan as an example, the Japanese army has been working hard to "eliminate" the guerrillas for 18 days, but their power has not been able to reach beyond 20 miles.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th by this Newspaper] Our army in northern Jiangxi achieved a great victory near Longgang on the 2nd, killing Japanese Colonel Kiroku and more than 300 Japanese soldiers, and destroying 30 Japanese vehicles. Between Chongyang and Tongcheng, there is a brigade of the Japanese 13th Division. A certain unit of our army attacked near Huanglaomen on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers and capturing more than 80 artillery pieces. Japanese soldiers in Xingzi and Dean have increased, and they have been conscripted to repair the highway.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Sihui on the 3rd by this Newspaper] There is no change in the war in Guangdong. Our newly援 troops are advancing in two directions and have arrived at their destinations. More than 3,000 Japanese troops arrived in the streets, and Koukou, and Xinkou, and Pingdi. Another 2,000 troops were sent to Kaihua County and stationed in the Caomeng Village and Longkou areas. In Shenzhen, Taipingchang has a large puppet first brigade, two artillery companies, and 300 cavalrymen. Sanshui has a total of 1,600 Japanese troops, 800 cavalrymen, 30 artillery pieces, and a total of 40 rubber boats and small electric boats, which travel back and forth in the Sanshui area. Heqing and Jiujiang have increased by more than 2,000 Japanese troops. More than 1,000 Japanese troops plan to invade from Fangcheng and Dongxing, and we are currently blocking them.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th by this Newspaper] According to reports, the Japanese troops in Hankou are now parts of the Sixth, Thirteenth, and Sixteenth Divisions, and the Watanabe Brigade of the Marine Corps is in the area. The Japanese 12th Division has also been dispatched from Beijing to Wuhan. More than ten Japanese small warships have arrived in Yueyang, northern Hunan, and Japanese troops have landed. The two railway bridges of Taolin and Pingshui Xiu have been bombed and destroyed by us. It is difficult for the Japanese to repair them for a while, and the Yuehan railway is not open to traffic. There is one Japanese small cruiser and more than 300 motorboats in Diaoyang Lake. Japanese fortifications are heavily fortified along the Yuehan Railway. The Japanese in Mingguang are manufacturing a large number of puppets.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Hequ, 2nd] A brigade of puppet troops, about 800 people, west of Sa County, Suiyuan, set off for Guyang on the morning of the 30th. The Heijiaotang area north of Guyang has been recovered by our army.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Our Financial Economy is Increasingly Consolidated, Customs Surplus Guarantees Interest Payments on Public Bonds <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hong Kong News] Since the War of Resistance, our country's authorities have made the greatest efforts to adjust finance and maintain credit, so the economic situation is becoming increasingly consolidated. Recently, the National Currency Fund Management Committee, in view of the fact that the payment of interest on the unified public bonds guaranteed by the customs surplus has been delayed, with a total amount of 5,128,300 yuan, although the enemy has drastically reduced our coastal tax revenue, it has decided to pay as scheduled. The Central Bank has been notified to find a way to advance the funds. The date when interest payments will begin in Hong Kong is of great concern to people here. The reporter specially interviewed Mr. Zheng Tieru, the manager of the Bank of China yesterday, who said that payments have already been made in various parts of the country, but the payment method in Hong Kong is divided into six installments, that is, one installment per month. This method is due to environmental reasons and to prevent opportunistic purchases of foreign exchange. In order to implement this method, the Ministry of Finance has specially printed booklets for processing. After the batch of booklets is shipped from Chongqing within a few days, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will begin to pay them immediately.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] A certain financial magnate in Guangzhou said that the loss of his industry due to the fall of Guangzhou is no less than that of the foreign goods weaving industry. The total loss of the industry is estimated to be more than one million yuan. Due to the sudden change, many people did not have time to bring their funds with them. Moreover, each bank often stores tens of thousands of yuan of small coins and copper cents to meet the needs of the market due to the daily business operations of each bank. During this escape, these small coins and copper cents could not be carried away. The sheer number of them is self-evident.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Merchants Reduce Foreign Exchange Settlement; Trade Commission Revises Measures <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Special Chongqing Airmail] The Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, in order to facilitate the sale and settlement of foreign exchange by export merchants, has formulated measures for merchants to reduce the settlement of foreign exchange at [blank] ports.

<p>(2) If, after the export of goods for which foreign exchange has already been sold and settled, the following circumstances arise upon arrival in [blank] Hong Kong, the exporter may, before finding a buyer and before a formal transaction, request the Hong Kong office of this Commission to handle the procedures for reducing foreign exchange settlement:</p>
<p>(A) The market price in Hong Kong at the time of sale is indeed lower than the estimated price standard used at the time of foreign exchange settlement.</p>
<p>(B) The quantity of goods at the time of sale is indeed less than at the time of foreign exchange settlement due to [blank] consumption or accidental loss.</p>
<p>(C) The quality of the goods at the time of sale is indeed inferior to that at the time of foreign exchange settlement due to changes.</p>
<p>(3) The Hong Kong office of this Commission shall handle the following procedures with respect to the provisions of Article 2:</p>
<p>(A) For the circumstances described in item 1 of that article, it shall first verify the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate." If it is indeed accurate, it shall immediately introduce the exporter to Fu Hua Company to purchase the goods in full at the price quoted by the merchant. However, if Fu Hua Company is unwilling to purchase the goods after the introduction, the merchant shall sell them to the buyer he has pre-arranged.</p>
<p>(B) For the circumstances described in item 2 of that article, it shall [blank] the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" and all relevant documents (all of which should have copies), and, if necessary, send personnel to inspect the goods.</p>
<p>(C) For the circumstances described in item 3 of that article, it shall examine the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" and all relevant documents (all of which should have copies), and verify the pre-determined [blank] price reported for the deteriorated goods. If necessary, it shall also send personnel to inspect the goods in detail.</p>
<p>(D) If Fu Hua Company is willing to purchase the pre-determined selling price reported by the merchant for the goods being sold, it shall be introduced to Fu Hua Company for purchase.</p>
<p>(4) After the Hong Kong office of this Commission has completed the handling of the above procedures, the merchant may sell the goods and obtain transaction documents (all of which should have duplicates) and submit them to the office for verification and issuance of a "Certificate for Merchants Reducing Export Foreign Exchange Settlement."</p>
<p>(5) After receiving the above certificate, the Hong Kong office of this Commission shall immediately fill out and issue a "Certificate for Merchants Reducing Export Foreign Exchange Settlement" after a thorough review and confirmation.</p>
<p>However, without going through the third step of the procedures, no matter what the circumstances, this explanation will absolutely not be issued.</p>
<p>(6) After issuing the above certificate, the Hong Kong office of this Commission shall extract copies of various documents [blank] [blank] held, and the originals shall be stamped with "Approved for Reduced Foreign Exchange Settlement" [blank] and returned to the merchant at any time. However, if there are no duplicate documents, and the originals cannot be extracted [blank], [blank] the office shall make an abstract copy.</p>
<p>(7) After receiving the above certificate, the merchant shall go to the bank to sell and deliver the foreign exchange obtained within two days [blank] of the date of issuance.</p>
<p>If the above deadline falls on a bank holiday, it will be postponed accordingly.</p>
<p>(8) After purchasing the foreign exchange, the bank shall indicate the certificate number on the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Advice" based on the above certificate for reduced foreign exchange settlement, so that this Commission can verify it.</p>
<p>(9) After filling out the above certificate, the Hong Kong office of this Commission shall immediately fill out a "Report on the Issuance of Certificates for Merchants Reducing Export Foreign Exchange Settlement" in detail, and send it along with a copy each of the certificate and various documents to this Commission for record.</p>
<p>(10) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation [blank].</p>

<p>[Shanghai Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency, 4th] According to Hua Fang sources, last year China's mineral exports were valued at $10,650,000, $4,000,000 more than the previous year, and $50,000,000 more than 1936. Furthermore, many mineral companies in the southwestern provinces exported more in the second half of last year, and it is expected that the export volume will be even greater this year.

<p>Forced to Salute × Soldiers [Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, [blank]th] Hankou Dispatch: The Japanese [blank] authorities recently issued a notice stating that henceforth, foreign nationals passing by places with Japanese sentries should present their identity cards [blank]. If foreign nationals violate this regulation and an accident occurs as a result, the Japanese side will not be responsible. After the issuance of this notice, people here felt extremely uneasy. The consular corps held a special meeting yesterday afternoon [blank], whereby each consul individually notified the Japanese military authorities, explaining that this action could cause misunderstandings [blank] and accidents, and it would be difficult for foreign nationals to be fully responsible. Reporters here inquired with the Japanese spokesperson about this yesterday, and the spokesperson stated that this was a method of maintaining order, and that the order had been implemented since the Japanese military occupied Hankou. When reporters asked whether the so-called salute to Japanese sentries meant removing one's hat or bowing, the spokesperson said that saluting Japanese sentries [blank] countries had such actions.</p>
<h3 id="e11">### Foreign Military Experts Observe Possible War Between Soviet Union and Japan; Friction Between the Two Countries Increasing; Great Impact on Sino-Japanese War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th] Shanghai Dispatch: At present, friction between Japan and the Soviet Union is increasing daily, and observers here are paying close attention to it, believing that it will have a great impact on the Sino-Japanese War [blank]. In particular, there are rumors that Japan is extremely short of manpower for its war against China [blank]. Therefore, once Japan is forced to shift its domestic manpower to Manchuria, and is unable to increase its strength in China, the Japanese army may be forced to withdraw from some vast areas within China.</p>
<p>Increasing Disputes Between Soviet Union and Japan</p>
<p>Incidents that are intensifying tension between Japan and the Soviet Union are [blank] increasing [blank]. Currently [blank], there are the following articles: (1) Fishing rights issue; (2) Resurgence of border conflicts between the Soviet Union and Manchuria; (3) Continued detention of Japanese ships [blank] within Soviet territorial waters; (4) Soviet authorities protested to Japan that the Japanese government treated Soviet diplomats with a lack of courtesy; (5) Border incidents and mining rights disputes in Sakhalin [blank]; (6) Increasingly active Soviet aid to China; (7) Some members of the Japanese Diet publicly called for [blank], if preparations between Japan and [blank] and other issues were not resolved promptly [blank], Japan should implement [blank] war against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>International Situation Unfavorable to Japan</p>
<p>In addition, the development of the international situation in the past two weeks may also have a significant impact on Japanese-Soviet relations, such as (1) rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union may [blank] normalize diplomatic relations; (2) Hitler and Chamberlain successively delivered speeches, and the tense situation in Europe is clearly easing. According to some interpretations, the speeches of the two men [blank] called for a four-power conference. The results of the four-power conference could change the European situation and implement adjustments. If so, the anti-communist [blank] and the advantageous position of Japan's current [blank] [blank] will inevitably be weakened; (3) The US government's plan to establish defenses on Guam and other bases in the Pacific has aroused Japan's attention. [Blank] In Southeast Asia, Japan's international situation may be even more [blank] unfavorable in the future. Military officials are reckless and disregard the national interest.</p>
<p>Military Officials are Reckless and Disregard the National Interest</p>
<p>However, the national [blank] of Japan, the military officials who talk about nothing but war, [blank] advocate an early [blank] to fight the Soviet Union [blank]. This [blank] [blank] is particularly encouraged by the military, and the reasons they hold are as follows: (1) Japan should occupy Vladivostok [blank] to eliminate the threat of the Soviet air force to Japan; (2) At present, the front line is silent within China [blank], resulting in a significant lack of resources that the Japanese side has plundered within China [blank] that can be used; (3) Once Japan and the Soviet Union [blank] [blank], all the clauses in the National Mobilization Law that have not yet been implemented can be fully implemented. In this way, the de facto military and fascist dictatorship can be established in Japan. According to recent observations of the situation, if this action is taken against China [blank] [blank], [blank] it is unlikely to appear [blank]. Recently, foreigners coming from Japan are increasingly convinced that the Soviet-Japanese war [blank] can break out within six months. It is reported that the Kwantung Army (among which there are some arrogant young military officers) is still eager to resume military [blank] against the Soviet Union. After the Zhanggufeng incident last year, fortunately Tokyo quickly dispatched [blank] military personnel who maintained a peaceful attitude [blank] to the scene of the incident, replacing the representative sent by Kwantung [blank], and [blank] the Soviet side negotiated a ceasefire, which [blank] smoothly promoted, and the sudden end of the world that was momentarily agitated was ended. According to observations by foreign military experts [blank], the current situation on the Soviet-Japanese border is extremely likely to erupt into war.</p>

<p>Promoting Education to Save the Nation; Saving the Nation to Protect Education: Bai's Speech at the Muslim Welcome Meeting in Chongqing</p>
<p>[Chongqing Correspondence] In this great war of resistance, a unified iron army of the entire nation has emerged. Any divisions on economic, ideological, or religious lines have been completely [blank] broken. What deserves attention is the Muslim community with more than 40 million believers, and because they have a strong and wise leadership, they have emerged even more prominently. Recently, under the slogan of "Promoting education to save the nation, saving the nation to protect education," they have organized themselves, and this is the emergence of the "China Muslim National Salvation Association." On January 29, the association held a grand gathering at the Qingzhen Mosque in Chongqing to welcome Chairman Bai [blank]sheng.</p>
<p>Amid enthusiastic applause from the audience, Mr. Bai [blank] entered the meeting [blank] with everyone in standing salute.</p>
<p>Mr. Bai [blank] in a yellow woolen military uniform [blank], white gloves, and with piercing eyes, inspired awe and respect. He took off his hat to salute everyone, revealing his bright head. Mr. Bai bears a heavy responsibility, handles myriad affairs every day, and has done so for decades. Here we can see how he has been laboring and thinking hard for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>His speech was divided into two parts. The first part was a report on the progress of the war of resistance over the past year and a half. He used precise facts, simple reasons, and sincere words, encouraging the members of the Muslim community as if talking about family matters, urging them to [blank] understand the facts, to cherish themselves, to save themselves, and to save the country. The second part was a description of the situation of religion itself. Here, even more diligently, tirelessly, and repeatedly, he put forward the reasons for intensifying the organization and training of the Muslim community. He had extremely important instructions [blank] enlightenment.</p>
<p>In the first paragraph [blank], he cited facts to prove the failures of the Japanese in the military, political, economic, and diplomatic spheres, and our victory. He said in extremely confident [blank] sentences: "Now I want to honestly tell everyone, I never tell lies, and I would never dare to deceive you. In the year and a half of the war of resistance, we have become stronger with each battle. Our great Chinese nation has not been damaged in the slightest, and is even greater than before. First, in terms of spirit, we have not yielded in the slightest. The soldiers at the front have never surrendered, and the people in the rear, even when displaced, have not complained. This spirit of 'dying [blank] rather than yielding, and not complaining about hardship' cannot be destroyed by the × people. Second, in terms of political power, although many cities have fallen, our political power still exists. For example, Chairman Han of Jiangsu, Chairman Shen of Shandong, Chairman Yan of Shanxi, Chairman Liao of Anhui, Chairman Huang of Zhejiang, ... they exercise their powers without any hindrance. Thus, the Japanese attempt to eliminate us and truly occupy our land is also impossible to [blank] do. The fourth is strength, from the July 7th Incident to the present. Our army has increased by two-thirds. The number of people is more, not less, than before, and the quality [blank] is also better than before. Therefore, the Japanese dream of eliminating our main force is also completely impossible. Therefore, everyone should [blank] [blank] be aware that if we support a protracted war, we will surely achieve final victory in less than three years."</p>
<p>Mr. Bai had been speaking for an hour in this paragraph. The sky was slowly darkening, and then Mr. Bai turned to the second question, "The question of religion itself," speaking even more sincerely, more concretely, and more forcefully. He truly deserves to be an enlightened leader [blank] leader of the Muslim community, just like a parent to his children. He said: "The organization of the China Muslim National Salvation Association is not for finding personal outlets, for seeking personal gain and corruption, or for getting promoted and making a fortune. To save the country is to protect the religion, and all members of the Muslim community must understand this reason and unite to invigorate themselves, and have the common belief to generate strength to save the country, rather than just hanging up a signboard or establishing an organization. The work of this association is 'organization' and 'training.' Religious organization is the most natural and the strongest. As long as it is reorganized and applied with scientific methods, it can become a powerful group for resisting Japan and saving the country." Why organize? Mr. Bai cited an example with [blank] [blank] four seats. He said, "For example, if we are holding a meeting here now, and bandits suddenly attack, everyone will be at a loss, and may even trample on each other to escape. But [blank] if it is a row of soldiers, it is different. Even if there are three or four hundred bandits, they can be repelled, because a row of soldiers has a company commander who can direct the resistance. We want to organize for this reason." "Training is also extremely important. Without training, we will not understand the methods of resisting the war, or the ways to save the country. Therefore, to resist the war and build the country, we must start with organization and training." At this time, the audience went from holding their breath to applauding enthusiastically, as if the path to brightness was opening up before their eyes.</p>
<p>Another very important point is that he taught clearly the relationship between the "front" and the "rear." It is a path to life to go forward, and a path to death to go backward. The backward retreat of the Song and Ming dynasties ultimately led to the destruction of the country. The × people can directly [blank] attack our rear, but we will not let them in. If we resist them fiercely, they will not force us quietly. We should not be afraid of approaching the × people. The more afraid we are, the more [blank] our will will be. Recently, according to Chairman Han of Jiangsu [blank], he has not seen × people's planes for several months at the front, which shows that it is safer than Chongqing. Safe places are everywhere. Whether in the front or the rear, as long as everyone's mind is at peace, they will surely feel at ease, and this is a safe place. Now in the rear of the × people, we still have hundreds of thousands of troops, and they are all the best troops, so I honestly tell everyone that the front is safer than the rear."</p>
<p>He also cared about the cultural and economic lives of tens of thousands of members of the Muslim community. He hoped that they could be gradually improved. He hoped that new talents could be produced from within the Muslim community, who could take on greater responsibilities. He said that "cultivating cadres" and "training young people" are extremely important.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Bai also reported on the work of the Muslim community in participating in the war of resistance, for establishing a national salvation organization, going to the Northwest to awaken eight million [blank] believers. The departure of the Near East visiting group, the establishment of the Northwest Public School and the founding of Chengda Normal School, the teachers trained by these schools can serve as principals on the one hand, and can also serve as teachers on the other hand, so as to achieve the unity of religion and education and strengthen the strength of religion. Mr. Bai's earnestness towards young people and his sincere love for the members of the Muslim community touched everyone. Mr. Bai also hoped that the members of the Muslim community who attended the meeting today would pass on what he said today to those who did not attend, or write letters to tell them, so as to make the young people truly generate faith and power.</p>
<p>Mr. Bai finished his speech at 6:10, and then Guang Ke San delivered a reply, urging everyone to promote education and [blank] the country under the leadership of the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek.</p>

<p>[Shanghai Dispatch from Reuters, [Blank] [Blank]th] Another incident of Japanese military detention of a foreign ship has occurred here. The Dutch ship Ada reportedly went to Wenzhou on the 22nd of last month and then disappeared. Mr. Ke Mo, the owner of the ship, told a Reuters reporter that after the ship sailed to Wenzhou at 8 a.m. on the 22nd with kerosene [blank] iron cargo, he suddenly received a report from his Chinese manager in Wenzhou that the ship was suddenly detained by a Japanese cruiser when it entered the port of [blank]zhou, forced to fly a Japanese flag, and towed to a destination unknown. At the same time, a report from Wenzhou stated that two foreign ships [blank] confirmed the detention of the Ada. One of the two ships had also been inspected by the Japanese military, but was not detained. Afterwards, a report from a Wenzhou civilian ship crew stated that the Ada had also been seen being towed by a Japanese [blank] a few days later. [Blank] The Consulate General is currently investigating and has protested to the Japanese Consul, but it is difficult to find out where the Ada is currently.</p>

<p>[Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 3rd Shanghai Dispatch: The Yongzhen and Haisha, two British and Norwegian merchant ships forcibly detained by the Japanese side, have been released and returned [blank] one after the other. [Blank] Haida is also on the way to Shanghai. Foreign merchants are deeply indignant at this kind of atrocity by the Japanese military [blank] and have petitioned the government to lodge a strong protest. Furthermore, according to the Yongzhen passenger who reported the detention situation, when the ship was unloading cargo in the port of Hexingzhen on the morning of January 24, three Japanese [blank] planes suddenly flew over the area to reconnoiter. The ship set sail on the morning of the 26th, and when it arrived at sea, six Japanese [blank] blocked the road and ordered it to stop, and sent marines to board the ship to inspect [blank], but found nothing. At noon on the 27th, they forced it to sail to Qingdao. Later, it was searched by the Japanese puppet army, and the silver coins held by the passengers were confiscated. The shipowner asked the British Consulate to negotiate, but the Japanese puppet and the customs authorities shirked responsibility to each other, and there was no result. The British Consul immediately telegraphed the British warship stationed in Wei to sail to protect it. It set sail and left Qingdao on the morning of the 29th. At that time, the Japanese warship was still trying to stop it and sent planes to threaten it, but fortunately the British warship followed and no incidents occurred, and the passengers were also safe.</p>

<p>[Xi'an Dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th] At 9:30 a.m. on the 28th of last month, five Japanese [blank] planes bombed Huixing [blank] Hejia Village. One Type 94 easy bomber No. 3016 was shot down by our army's machine guns [blank] in Pinglu, where our army visited the site. Two Japanese pilots set fire to destroy the plane [blank], prompting our army to mobilize the local [blank] populace [blank]. Half of the plane's body was destroyed. The plane is worth about 400,000 Japanese yen. The engine is still in good condition. The two pilots were also captured alive [blank]. One is an air force lieutenant named Yamada Kiyoshi, and the other is named Omori [blank] Kiyoshi [blank]. The one prisoner, Lu Jingyuan, volunteered to surrender. That night, our army gathered more than a thousand soldiers and civilians to hold a meeting and perform plays to welcome him. Yamada Kiyoshi used Japanese to tell the public how the Japanese warlords deceived their national army and people, saying that attacking China was to prevent China from becoming communist. After he was captured, he saw that the Chinese soldiers [blank] were spirited and the people were heroic, and he began to believe that it was entirely the strength of the Three Principles of the People, and had nothing to do with communism. [Blank] He later expressed his willingness to work under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People to save Japan and save the world [blank].

<p>[Tokyo Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency, 4th] According to [blank] Tong sources, the results of the Japanese Parliament's discussion of the Far East situation can be summarized as follows: (1) Continue to invade China and form a "New East Asian Regime," as stated by former Prime Minister Kondo [blank] Ming last year. At the same time, the Japanese Navy will continue to blockade the Chinese coast, and the Japanese Army will prepare to fight against the Soviet Union in addition to invading China. The Japanese Navy [blank] has more than enough power [blank] [blank] to defend the Western Pacific and protect Japanese territory. (2) The Japanese government will never [blank] negotiate peace with China, and is willing to buy over traitors to organize a puppet regime. Japan, "Manchukuo," and "China" will also closely cooperate economically, militarily, and politically. (3) The Japanese government declares that this economic group of three East Asian countries does not monopolize the Far East market. It welcomes individual countries to provide assistance, except for political or military [blank] or interference in internal affairs. Also, after the [blank] regime is established, it will automatically abolish the concessions and extraterritorial rights, the Nine-Power Treaty, and various guarantees, as they have lost their timeliness.</p>
<p>[Tokyo Dispatch from Associated Press, 4th] "Kokumin Shimbun" predicts that the Japanese government will reply to the notes from Britain, the United States, and France to Japan within this week. The newspaper predicts that the contents of the Japanese government's reply will be as follows: (1) Reject the suggestion to convene an international conference. (2) Reiterate Japan's policy toward China, and [blank] respect the interests of foreigners except where "militarily necessary." (3) Declare that Japan's [blank] settlement of East Asia is a great contribution to "world permanent peace." (4) Deny that Japan is destroying [blank] the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>

Arita said that Japan is fully prepared to repel attacks from the Soviet Union and other countries. Regarding the anti-Japanese problem in the United States, Arita hopes that Japanese people will not make meaningless provocations regarding American arguments.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Roosevelt's Talk: US Policy Unchanged; Note to Italy on Public Opinion; Pittman Stresses Military Balance <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] President Roosevelt today sternly refuted various rumors concerning the US defense and foreign policies, stating that "such rumors are completely unfounded. The current government's policies are fully encompassed in my message to Congress, and there are no other new matters in policy. Regarding the secret meetings I held with various committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the only secret item was intelligence transferred from intelligence agencies. If this intelligence were to be announced, it would be difficult for the aforementioned sources to continue providing intelligence." When answering the question "America's front line is in France," President Roosevelt smiled and said, "Not only did we not say such a thing, but it is also inconsistent with the facts. After this rumor was published, Britain and France expressed welcome, while Germany and Italy attacked it incessantly. Whether it is welcome or attack, it is based on reports that are inconsistent with the facts."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Senator Pittman declared today that "We should completely dispel the fear of the President [leading us] to the road of war from President Roosevelt's foreign policy speech. The desire to maintain political, economic, and social independence with other countries applies to both totalitarian and democratic countries. I believe that the only way to avoid a European war (which has the possibility of extending to the United States) is to balance the military strength of all countries, because neither side is willing to engage in a war that may result in failure."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] Roosevelt, when meeting with reporters yesterday, stated that rumors circulating that he had declared during a meeting with members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee on the 1st that "America's defense front line is in France or on the Rhine" are deliberately misleading. President Roosevelt then listed the four major points of his foreign policy: (1) The United States opposes forming alliances with foreign countries; (2) The United States advocates maintaining trade between all countries in the world; (3) The United States expresses sympathy for all efforts to reduce or limit armaments; (4) The United States expresses sympathy for maintaining the political, economic, and social independence of all countries in the world by peaceful means, with the United States as a member of the international community. Roosevelt firmly insisted that US foreign policy has not changed in the past and will remain the same in the future, but some members of Congress and biased newspapers still deliberately distort it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 3rd] The American Ambassador to Italy, Phillips, recently sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, calling Foreign Minister Ciano's attention to the criticism of President Roosevelt in Italian newspapers and requesting an explanation. According to the semi-official Italian newspaper *Il Popolo d'Italia*, President Roosevelt is "suffering from hysteria and has gone mad." Other newspapers said that President Roosevelt intends to subvert the political systems of all-powerful nations, incite Latin American countries to resist all-powerful nations, and initiate an arms race.</p>
<p>Hess Issues a Frenzied Warning to Britain and America</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Hess, a leading member of the German Social Democratic Party, stated in a speech in Berlin last night: "Our front line is the bulwark of the West, not the Rhine. Our front line has been determined and will not allow any foreign soldiers to cross it. If Britain and America want to move their front lines, we will let them do so. National Socialism cannot be changed by debate, preaching, or lectures. The policies of the National Socialist Party cannot be changed by Western agitators or democracies across the Atlantic, even if speculative and arms businesses suffer losses as a result."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, recently proposed that the government should publicly release all documents related to the French purchase of aircraft. Ten members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee have expressed their support for this proposal (the Military Affairs Committee has a total of eighteen members), so Clark's proposal may be realized today. According to Clark, if the Military Affairs Committee rejects this request, he intends to submit it directly to the Senate. It is reported that the documents state that the Army authorities originally opposed selling the latest fighter jets to foreign countries. A minority of members of Congress are stepping up their attacks on government policy, hoping to end secret diplomacy. It is believed that unless President Roosevelt clearly explains his foreign policy, a number of members of Congress will oppose all legislation related to foreign relations. If Clark's proposal ultimately succeeds, then regarding the issue of expanding the air force, it will be easier to determine which of the proposals of Johnson (Republican Senator from California) and Woodring, the Secretary of War, will prevail. It is rumored that Johnson advocates that the United States add 13,000 aircraft, but the total number of aircraft in Woodring's phased plan submitted to President Roosevelt is only one-third of Johnson's plan. It is rumored that many non-military officials within the Department of War support Woodring's proposal.</p>
<h3 id="e21">British Foreign Secretary Delivers Speech: Praises Chamberlain's Policy; Military Expansion Sufficient to Cope with War; Attaches Importance to Italian Guarantees on Spain <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] The British Foreign Secretary, Halifax, delivered a speech on the achievements of Britain's military expansion at the City Hall here yesterday. He said that "In the past two or three years, as a result of our small-scale promotion of the navy, army, and air force, our country's strength has not yet reached its previous strong position. Therefore, if some people believe that once something happens, our country will be unable to cope, this view is wrong. We must endure the cruelty of modern warfare, but we also have the right to avoid it. The British people are unwilling to quarrel with others, but once forced to do so, I believe they will not hesitate, and the result is also expected. The relationship between our country and individuals is firmly based on human respect for freedom, while in some other countries, it is based on concepts that are contrary to ours. This conflict of concepts, coupled with the disputes left over from the Great War, is creating the main cause of the current chaotic emotions. In the current emotions, violence is regarded as strength, and tolerance is regarded as weakness. Therefore, our country is determined to work hard to establish true peace. It would have been easy for Mr. Chamberlain to abandon his efforts to mediate European peace, and others may have done so long ago. Mr. Chamberlain's perseverance has been severely attacked, but as far as I know, Mr. Chamberlain's composed and undaunted spirit is unparalleled. Mr. Chamberlain and other members of the government have never underestimated the difficulties of the current dangerous national situation. The Prime Minister's greatest advantage is that he has not surrendered to critics (as you often know, there are very few overseas critics) and abandoned his efforts for true peace. Even if Mr. Chamberlain's efforts completely fail and our country is forced into war, I will still firmly believe that these efforts are completely correct and of great benefit to Europe. Because during this period, the entire people of the country will be united and firm, regardless of party affiliation, and strive for peace with the greatest confidence. They themselves may not realize the immensity of their own strength, but its impact on world moral opinion is inestimable." Halifax also stated that he does not believe that a major war is inevitable. He then spoke of Italy's guarantees to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean and have no territorial ambitions in Spain, saying, "For two years, Spain has been the main factor in European disputes, and France and here are deeply concerned about it because the power of the two countries is threatened. We should attach importance to the guarantees given by Mussolini this time."</p>
<p>Britain Has Not Discriminated Against German Trade</p>
<p>Halifax, after defending Britain's policy of non-intervention, said, "In today's world, international contact is often fraught with friction, resulting in frequent rumors. Several central factories must work overtime to increase production. Although I sympathize with this unnecessary panic, I have seen the increase in British unity and the people's resolute calmness. More than one million people have voluntarily participated in air raid prevention services. In short, the British people are those who love Britain and are prepared to obtain what they consider important rights and interests. Although the British people love peace, they are willing to fight for things that make life worthwhile, and peace also has its reasons. In his speech a few days ago, Hitler said that Germany must develop its export trade, or it will die. Germany's situation is indeed like this, and Britain is also like this. Hitler also said that the last World War was an attempt to exclude Germany from world trade, which is not true. Before the European War, Germany and Britain were the best customers, and the commercial and financial relationship between the two countries was closer than that of any other country. Would we have wanted to exclude Germany from world trade at that time or now? We will never believe that competition can exclude other countries and monopolize it." Regarding Hitler's prediction that there would be a long period of peace, he said, "I hope to fulfill this prediction more sincerely than anyone else. After the world has been guaranteed peace, trade can be revived and economic development will be possible. Everyone will benefit from peace. This achievement is far superior to the achievements of the last century. If the world remains an armed fortress, the existing difficulties will continue to exist. If the countries of the world do not work together for the common good, then basic economic standards cannot be improved. The fact that Britain and Germany have a good relationship, so we are always prepared to cooperate with other countries in practical contributions and will continue to cooperate to achieve this goal, is a symbol of good relations between Britain and Germany."</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Dismissal of Schacht <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from London)</p>
<p>In the previous dispatch, the reporter pointed out the significant impact of the behind-the-scenes financial negotiations conducted by Schacht and Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, over the past month or so, on the development of the entire European situation. Now, the news of Schacht's dismissal by Hitler has suddenly appeared before the people of the world.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Hitler's move is a serious demonstration against Britain, causing shock in all aspects of Britain. All British newspapers that appeared today and last night have placed this news in the most important position, and most of them have detailed editorials. However, looking at the general tone, it is still attributed to Germany's domestic financial reasons, and the significance of this move in international relations is cleverly omitted; but the feeling of unease is clearly revealed in the lines.</p>
<p>According to today's news here, Schacht has been removed from his position as President of the National Bank; but he still retains the status of "a member of the German government." This means that here, Hitler is still leaving a path for negotiation and compromise with Britain; at any time, negotiations can still be carried out. If Britain cannot withstand Hitler's loud intimidation and is willing to make financial concessions to win Germany's favor in order to temporarily seek safety, then she can still do so through Schacht. However, looking at the recent developments, Hitler's dream is highly unlikely to be achieved.</p>
<p>When Schacht's trip to London at the end of last year completely failed to achieve his expected goals and he returned quietly, some radicals within Germany were very dissatisfied with him; but at the time, his explanation was: Although this trip was fruitless, hope has not been cut off. Because he had already agreed with Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, that negotiations could still be carried out in the near future. Then, he drafted various plans regarding the maintenance of German finances, the most important of which was the so-called demand for Britain and France to return the German reparations after the European War, as a powerful argument for future negotiations. Sure enough, Norman's trip to Germany was realized ahead of schedule. However, during the process of this negotiation, other complications arose. At this time, the British government suddenly learned of Hitler and Mussolini's joint plan with Japan to expand this year; at the same time, the British Foreign Office received intelligence that even if Franco won in Spain, the Italian troops would never withdraw. In the same situation, it is said that the negotiations conducted by Germany with Dr. Schacht as its representative have no restraining effect on Germany's ambitions. Therefore, in order to prevent Norman from making concessions too quickly, the British government immediately took several steps: First, British Foreign Secretary Halifax quickly notified Norman, informing him of Britain's temporary decision regarding German strategy, hoping that he would not make specific concessions, and at best, could end his trip to Germany in the name of a private trip; secondly, the British government immediately issued a notice prohibiting any direct or indirect easing of restrictions on Germany; the last and most powerful move was to immediately announce that, starting today, approximately 290 million in gold would be transferred from the Bank of England to another national financial institution. With these steps, the negotiations between Norman and Dr. Schacht, which were in progress, were immediately shelved and became completely meaningless.</p>
<p>Britain's actions naturally aroused Hitler's great resentment, and he decided to retaliate. As a result, there was the sudden dismissal of Dr. Schacht, who was labeled as a "moderate," and his successor was the person who had made contributions to the rapid expansion of economic power abroad.</p>
<p>Speaking only in economic terms, Germany's move actually has no intimidating effect on Britain at all. Even if the currently noisy German market expansion plan is accelerated, even if all the economic plans that Germany is currently planning are implemented, British economic experts firmly believe in a number of facts: Germany's economic situation has indeed reached its limit; as for the future, if it does not give up its arms race with Britain, then the fundamental collapse of its economy is inevitable.</p>
<p>However, the greatest significance of Schacht's dismissal lies in the political aspect. Continuing along this path, the long-brewing intimidation of prohibiting the expansion of British and French armaments will probably be presented soon. [1, 27]</p>
<h3 id="e23">Various Countries Expand Their Navies: Germany Builds Submarines; France Pays Close Attention; Soviet Union Will Follow Germany in Building Cruisers <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement allows Hitler to build 80 to 90 submarines. France is very alarmed by this. Naval Minister Campinchi has been ordered to immediately report to the Naval Committee, informing Britain that after Germany builds submarines equal to France according to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, France's navy will be in a clearly disadvantageous situation, because the French fleet needs to cope with the German and Italian fleets simultaneously. France has 76 submarines (including the largest in the world), and 22 are about to be built, for a total of 98. This number will be equal to Hitler's submarine fleet. However, France is well aware that Italy has 101 submarines, so the strength of France's submarine force is two to one compared with the two totalitarian countries. This will cause serious danger to France's defense and communication lines in the North Sea and the Mediterranean. France has no treaty or agreement restricting the construction of submarines, so it is concentrating its efforts on building ships to compete with Italy. France is now accelerating the completion of two 35,000-ton battleships to resist Italy's three newly built battleships.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] German requests to increase submarine tonnage and increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers have been commented on by British naval officials, who said that as far as the submarine part is concerned, it will take Germany four years to achieve its goal if it wants to bring its total tonnage to the same level as Britain. This will be a different matter if Germany can greatly increase its construction rate. The existing submarine tonnage of that country ranges from 250 tons to 600 tons per ship. According to confirmed information, the country plans to build large submarines ranging from 800 tons to 1,500 tons, whose cruising range is far beyond that of existing submarines. Regarding the cruiser part, Germany is requesting to increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers from five to seven, the reason for which is that the Soviet government is building seven such cruisers, but they have not provided concrete evidence. According to the Anglo-Soviet Naval Agreement, it was stipulated that if Germany built five Class A cruisers, the Soviet Union could build seven. Now that Germany has increased the number of such cruisers, the Soviet Union will inevitably follow suit in accordance with the guarantee clauses contained in the naval agreement, and the impact of this will inevitably lead to a competition in shipbuilding.</p>

<p>[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 4th] According to the announcement here last night, Hitler reorganized the Air Force at the suggestion of Aviation Minister General Goering, and replaced a large number of senior officials. After this change, all German air affairs are under the command of the Supreme Air Force Commander, and a large number of young aviation personnel have been promoted to generals. Most of these personnel were pilots during the European War, and are between 40 and 45 years old, and most of them have not held any positions. Those who were lieutenant colonels or colonels have been promoted to generals. This plan is unprecedented in German history, which shows Hitler's emphasis on the Air Force. In addition, Hitler appointed General Milch of the Political Office as the Inspector General of the Air Force, under whom are four departments: Air Defense, Training, Aircraft Manufacturing, and Air Machinery. Udet, a famous pilot during the European War, was appointed as the Director of the Machinery Department, so that strategic cooperation plans could be made. The Army, Navy, and Air Force will each send Air Force generals to be advisors to the Supreme Commanders of the Army and Navy. The Air Force itself will also be extensively updated. The entire German Air Force will be divided into three major commands: East, West, and North. Each command will be divided into several Air Force divisions, and each division commander will be a young Air Force general. Each command will have a Commander-in-Chief. In addition, the Air Force in East Prussia will be under the jurisdiction of the Air Force Commander in that area.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The economic editor of the *Financial News* stated, "According to my knowledge, there has been no further news recently regarding the British loan to China. British businessmen are quite in favor of giving China proper economic assistance, and the British government is also quite sympathetic to China. Whether China can obtain British economic assistance depends on whether it can continue to repay its customs debts. China has made considerable progress in managing its currency in the past six months, so recently, British proposals to support Chinese currency with loans have become more powerful. The British Parliament will discuss this issue further when it discusses the export credit loan plan in the future. Some opinions believe that British loans to China will be guaranteed by the government, and private banks will make the loans."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Reuters reports that the Chinese government's purchasing committee is likely to sign a contract with a British company in the near future to purchase 300 heavy-duty trucks for the Burma Road. The funds required will be deducted from the export credit guarantee loan granted to China by the British government in November of last year. It was previously rumored that the roadbed of the Burma Road would be difficult for heavy-duty trucks exceeding one ton to pass, but with the strengthening of the roadbed project, the current progress is going smoothly. When the trucks arrive in China, trucks weighing 7 tons will also be able to pass without obstruction. It is reported that China and Britain have begun preliminary talks on China using part of the additional British loan funds to purchase railway and telegraph materials. Some sources say that the amount is approximately 4 million to 5 million pounds, but this has not been confirmed. According to sources here, the current Sino-British negotiations are still preliminary in nature. It is widely rumored here that the British are planning to grant loans to China, and the loan is planned to be in the form of stabilizing the Sino-British currency system, but it is said that these negotiations will take a considerable amount of time to conclude, so there are few concrete results at present. According to reports, the United States is also considering similar measures to consolidate China's currency system, but it is unlikely that anything will be announced. It is also reported that China and Britain are actively negotiating on the issue of China repaying loans secured by tariffs.</p>

<p>According to a Chongqing dispatch, Wang Jingwei has regretted his "suggestions" and recently decided to reside in Europe, with Paris as his primary destination. The Central Government is being extremely generous to Wang, providing him with travel expenses, and so on.</p>
<p>If the news of Wang Jingwei going to Europe is true, it would be a welcome development. This is because it would prove that the public will of the entire nation has finally prevailed, and any pro-Japanese elements, defeatists, and surrenderists will be submerged by the people's surging tide for freedom.</p>
<p>If Wang's departure to Europe becomes a reality, we must have a few fundamental understandings:</p>
<p>First, Wang's departure to Europe absolutely cannot represent any activities of the Chinese government or the people. We must also urge all sectors at home and abroad to closely monitor his words and actions. If he does not repent and atone for his sins, and if he does not abandon his views, then he cannot wash away the shame of his [censored] face.</p>
<p>Second, even if Wang goes to Europe, it cannot be said that Wang's betrayal of the party, selling out the country, and surrender is over, because defeatists are still singing the tune of "peace" and "anti-communism," willingly acting as a special task force for the Japanese aggressors. Moreover, lurking pro-Japanese elements are taking advantage of various clever disguises to seek opportunities to act. We cannot ignore or relax our work against traitors because of Wang's distant retreat.</p>
<p>Third, even if Wang goes to Europe, his propaganda apparatus and his personal lackeys are still scattered throughout the country and abroad, and may even change their methods of operation to carry out their conspiracies. This is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>However, Wang's failure is already certain. Any future actions by Wang will not be successful, and he will not even be able to restore his old political status of "selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head"! We hope that all pessimists and defeatists will take Wang as a lesson. We also hope that the small number of people who blindly echoed Wang in the past will take Wang as a warning and actively support the Central Government, strengthen unity, persist in the War of Resistance, and strive for the final victory of the Chinese nation's liberation!</p>

<h3 id="e35">[Censored] Efforts to Seize the Nanyang Market Heavily Impact Hong Kong's Nanyang Trade; Volume of Goods Exchanged Declines Daily Over Several Months; [Censored] Goods Change Labels and Flood Southward in a Continuous Stream <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Since the change in the situation in South China, [censored]'s promotion of its southward advance plan has become increasingly acute. In the occupied areas, it actively manipulates and monopolizes any business operations. Towards the markets in Hong Kong and Nanyang, it takes advantage of the military expansion period to urgently seek to seize control, hoping to obtain substantial economic assistance from this and enhance its aggressive power. Among them, the Philippines, Laos, Annam, and [censored] India are particularly active. The ambition is not only to defeat the economic status of overseas Chinese in the above-mentioned regions, but also to occupy the markets of goods from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. Therefore, [censored] goods are shipped to various parts of Nanyang via Hong Kong after changing trademarks and labels, and are sold at extremely low prices. The numbers are increasing day by day. According to sources from a certain trading firm, in the past three months, almost every liner transporting [censored] goods via Hong Kong to Nanyang has been filled with them. Because it is a secret operation, it is difficult to obtain statistical figures. However, based on observations of the situation, it is believed that it has greatly increased compared to before. However, in this situation, the most obvious fact is the drastic shrinkage of the business of Hong Kong's Nanyang trading firms. Since the outbreak of the Guangdong war, the business of Hong Kong's Nanyang trading firms has been declining day by day. On average, the volume of goods exchanged each month has decreased by about 20-40% compared to the past few months. The biggest reason for this is, on the one hand, that transportation is interrupted. The various goods that the Nanyang trading firms used to procure in the interior and ship south are now blocked. On the other hand, [censored] merchants are stepping up their activities in the south, actively seizing local markets, and providing various inducements to local natives to help them sell [censored] goods, causing the sales of our country's goods to be increasingly obstructed. The goods shipped by various Nanyang trading firms have gradually decreased. At the same time, because the domestic market has been destroyed by the war, the import of local products from various parts of Nanyang has almost completely stopped. Therefore, under the above circumstances, the business of various Nanyang trading firms in Hong Kong has suffered a major blow.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Last Year's Treasury Revenue Increased by More Than 3 Million Compared to the Previous Year, But Expenditures Increased More Than Revenue; Total Deficit Exceeds 400,000 Yuan <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday morning's Hong Kong Gazette, the total actual revenue of the Hong Kong government last year was $16,735,854.68, an increase of more than $6 million compared to the original budget of $30,254,920. Compared to the actual revenue of $33,196,368.10 in the previous year, it also increased by more than $1 million. As for the expenditure direction, the actual expenditure last year was $37,175,897.82, exceeding the original budget of $33,337,9549 by more than $3 million, which is also an increase of more than [censored] compared to the actual expenditure of $32,111,222 in the previous year.</p>
<p>Increased Revenue, Even Greater Expenditures</p>
<p>Dividing the above figures for analysis, the increase in revenue is not as much as the increase in expenditure. Comparing revenue and expenditure, the deficit is nearly one million yuan. If we look at December alone, the revenue reached $3,199,514.11, an increase of more than $200,000 compared to the revenue of $2,921,219.76 in the same month of the previous year. As for expenditure, that month actually spent $5,982,720.73, an increase of more than $2 million compared to the $3,196,773.16 in the same month of the previous year. Comparing revenue and expenditure, the deficit reached more than $2 million.</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Increased by Hundreds of Thousands</p>
<p>Looking at last year's financial revenue and expenditure situation, the increase in revenue mainly came from the increase in the following items: (1) Tax revenue increased by $1,479,713.30 compared to the original budget; (2) License fees and other unclassified internal revenue reached $900,635.31; (3) Litigation fees and others reached $127,411.43; (4) Revenue from the Kowloon-Canton Railway reached $484,347.45; (5) Revenue from government properties reached $173,366.58; (6) Miscellaneous revenue reached $114,572.88; (7) Revenue from the sale of public land reached $671,046.15.</p>
<p>Expenditures Exceeded Budget by a Large Margin</p>
<p>As for the items whose expenditures increased compared to the original budget, the most noteworthy are: (1) Postal expenditure increased by $154,960.94; (2) Wireless communication expenditure was $211,020.71; (3) Port expenditure reached $210,886.09; (4) Fire department expenditure reached $71,376.49; (5) Police expenditure was $179,794.14; (6) Health department expenditure reached $389,210.48; (7) Education department expenditure was $100,467.01; (8) Kowloon-[Censored] Railway Bureau item $332,485.24; (9) Military expenditure item reached $1,294,308.47; (10) Miscellaneous expenditure reached $1411,942.84; (11) Public Works Department extraordinary expenditure item $389,604.33. From the above revenue and expenditure situation, it can be observed that if Hong Kong's finances are to be sound, there is still room for improvement. However, this is only a temporary observation. If we look at the balance sheet as of the end of last December, there is still a surplus of $13,562,234.97.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Rumor Has It Germany Will Abandon The Huge Trade Agreement; Original Barter Target of 100 Million Yuan; Hong Kong Foreign Firms Actively Seek To Obtain Market Share <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Two years ago, our government signed a reciprocal agreement with Germany, in which our country would exchange tungsten ore, tung oil, etc. for German machinery. The value of both parties' goods was set at 100 million yuan. The company managing this matter was the Sino-German Trading and Credit Company, a semi-official German entity. After the agreement was signed, the above-mentioned products were gradually placed under control, and German and other foreign firms not only despaired of attempting to monopolize them, but even trying to get involved in them was impossible. Now, according to news from London, the agreement seems to be on the verge of being abandoned. Since the German government withdrew its German advisors, this agreement has suffered a major blow. Although the trade between the two parties has not reached the specified amount of 100 million yuan, it has already begun to be settled. Hong Kong [Censored] foreign firms, upon hearing the news, have been actively seeking to obtain a share of the pie, because tungsten and tung oil are both products that various countries are eager to acquire.</p>

<p>According to the Gazette, the Legal Secretary recently issued a new regulation prohibiting shops and hawkers from selling lottery tickets on behalf of others. This regulation supplements the 1931 Betting Tax Ordinance and will be submitted to the Legislative Council for approval. The amendment to the ordinance stipulates that no one can sell betting tickets, receipts, or substitutes thereof on behalf of others, except for those who have obtained permission from the police authorities to sell them, and the organizations that issue the tickets. It is an exception. It is noted that the Hong Kong Jockey Club holds a one-dollar grand lottery every year. Those who act as agents to promote lottery tickets receive a 10% commission. Many people in Hong Kong receive the lottery from the association to promote and profit. In the future, after the new regulations are passed and implemented by the Legislative Council, those who sell lottery tickets in small amounts will be in violation of the regulations and will be subject to legal sanctions.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of surplus university education in our country is becoming increasingly serious. After the War of Resistance, the number of young people who are out of school, unemployed, and displaced has increased. The promotion of vocational education is most important at this time. Recently, Fang Xiaoyue, a well-known figure in academic circles, has specially joined forces with a group of experts and scholars in Hong Kong to establish a Hainan Vocational School, following the vocational school regulations of the Ministry of Education, and specially creating a special learning environment for talented young people, shortening the overall learning process for young people, and cultivating specialists in various social undertakings in a shorter period of time. It is reported that the school currently offers three departments: Agriculture, Journalism, and Drama. The professors and instructors who are in charge of teaching include Jiang Kanghu, Chen Yushan, Ouyang Yuqian, Xu Peikun, Hu Chunbing, Chuan Buwei, and Li Ding, all of whom are well-known in society. Their thoughts and careers are all very progressive and profound. The school's purpose is to emphasize practical work. The agriculture department is equipped with a practice farm located in Pingling, Yuen Long. Yesterday, I passed by the New Territories and passed by the farm. The person in charge of the school guided me to visit. I saw that the farm was located at the foot of Pingling Mountain, surrounded by a large stream. The planting and transplantation techniques were excellent, and the students were developing a solid academic style based on farming and reading, which is very promising. In addition to workers working, it is said that there are plans to use refugees to engage in reclamation work using the work-for-relief method. The school buildings for the agriculture department are temporarily located in the village houses of Zhongwu Village in Yuen Long. The new school site is located on the highway in the village and is currently being planned and built. In addition, the journalism department emphasizes practical training in interviewing and writing. It is in contact with newspapers and can conduct on-site experiments at any time. The drama department also has various guidance facilities for practical performances. In addition to the regular courses, there are also special classes, many of which are special lectures to supplement and deepen the knowledge of current professionals, or to tutor ordinary people in applied skills. For example, the journalism department offers special classes in drama, basic English classes (using Walker's 850-word teaching method), and basic Chinese language, etc., and new subjects can be added at any time. The school is located at 39 Jiupo Road, Kowloon, and has begun accepting students. Classes are scheduled to begin in early March.</p>

<p>After issuing new nickel coins, the Hong Kong authorities planned to gradually recall the old nickel coins and dime coins. Approximately 70% of the total have been recalled. The authorities originally intended to announce the abolition of old coins at the end of the Lunar New Year this year. Afterwards, [Censored] New Year's Eve was approaching, and auxiliary coins were urgently needed for circulation, so the date was repeatedly changed. It is planned to notify the abolition after the New Year. However, during this transitional period, incidents of people refusing to use [Censored] coins ahead of schedule have been discovered in the market, causing financial fluctuations due to this impact. Treasury Secretary Buckley, for this reason, specially met with reporters yesterday morning and issued an important statement, saying that he saw a report this morning that China Motor Bus had refused to accept old coins. He hereby solemnly declared that from now on, no matter who it is, before the government officially issues a notice announcing the abolition of old nickel coins and silver dimes, they cannot refuse to accept them, because old coins and silver dimes are still in circulation in Hong Kong and have not lost their currency value. Residents must continue to circulate them until the government issues a notice abolishing the old coins and cannot discriminate against them. If [Censored] violates the discipline and refuses to accept them, they will be punished severely according to the law for disrupting financial order.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Remembering Mr. Xu Chongzhi's Arrival <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Falling Sunset</p>
<p>The National Policy of Resistance is My Consistent Stance</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Chongzhi, a senior member of the party and state and current vice president of the Control Yuan, recently received a telegram from the central government to return to Chongqing to take on an important position. He boarded the American President Lines' President Coolidge to rush south towards Chongqing. Yesterday, the steamship carrying Mr. Xu safely arrived in Hong Kong. As a reporter, I rushed to the steamship to interview him. Here is a brief record of my observations:</p>
<p>At noon, I took a ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui. In the middle of the river, I could already see the black body and red smokestack of the President Coolidge slowly approaching in the green waves. When it arrived at the Kowloon Wharf, it was already crowded with black [censored] people. Mr. Du Yuesheng, wearing a black coat, [censored] long gown, and black satin shoes, and celebrities such as Kong Lingni and Mao Yuanhe, stood aside, chatting leisurely, occasionally looking up at the approaching steamship.</p>
<p>As soon as the President Coolidge docked, the iron [censored] steamer [censored] blew its departure whistle. The bridgehead was full of people who were reluctant to see them off, while the bridge tail was full of guests who were happily receiving the steamship. After the send-off people passed by, the pick-up people ran forward in a commotion. When I arrived at the ship's office, I picked up the passenger list, but there was no Mr. Xu's name on it. This was quite a surprise. Several colleagues and Mr. Xu's relatives searched separately. Some people who came to pick up the ship said, "Mr. Xu didn't come!" After all, Mr. Du Yuesheng and his party led the way and found Mr. Xu at a stairwell.</p>
<p>The people who came to pick up the ship rushed forward to shake hands and exchange greetings. Mr. Xu stood very excitedly and sincerely among the people, returning the courtesy one by one and thanking them. Hope you are doing well. Mr. Xu was wearing a beige suit. He was extraordinarily energetic, and fully revealed his decades of experience and perseverance in running for the party and the country.</p>
<p>He spoke Shanghainese with the people he was socializing with, but when he met a reporter, he switched back to his [censored] fluent Cantonese. He always had a smile when he spoke. When the reporter began to talk to him, he nodded repeatedly as soon as he heard that it was a reporter and said, "Ah! Please wait a moment." Then he quickly taught his entourage to take out his written statement. The written statement said: "Since the central government has solemnly declared the national policy of resistance, Chongzhi has always consistently advocated nothing more than this. However, I hope that the people of the country will unite and go to this goal together. Chongzhi will definitely devote his meager strength and respectfully follow the people of the country. Chongzhi belongs to the military and has little to say about politics, but he will serve the Three Principles of the People of the Prime Minister for life, and strive to maintain our national rights and make our people stand on an equal footing in the world." Although only a few words, Mr. Xu's patriotic enthusiasm has been fully expressed!</p>
<p>When asked how long he would stay in Hong Kong, he said it was uncertain.</p>
<p>According to a certain related party, Mr. Xu's trip to Chongqing is to participate in the meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council organized by the Fifth Plenary Session to jointly formulate plans for the war of resistance.</p>

Refugee Children's Free School Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday, Appealing to Overseas Compatriots for Sponsorship of Refugee Children's Education <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>The bombs of the [Japanese] devils have created a scene of displaced refugees. What particularly breaks my heart is the sight of the elderly, weak, and young, unable to withstand the drastic changes in their environment. Seeing the children's cries, hunger, and cold truly makes us worry about this group of future masters!</p>
<p>The Kowloon Victoria Refugee Children's Free School in Hong Kong is extending warm and loving hands to rescue a portion of the school-aged children who have lost their opportunity to learn. In these difficult times, the spirit of "cherishing one's own young, and extending that care to the young of others" is truly even more precious.</p>
<p>Yesterday at twelve noon, the school held its first graduation ceremony at the Confucius Hall.</p>
<p>"Today's children are the masters of the future," "Rescue children from hardship," "Refugee schools are schools of society," "If the national crisis is not over for one day, the national responsibility is not completed for one day," "..." Alerting slogans were plastered all over the hall, explaining the school's motivation and purpose in establishing the school. In conversations with reporters and receptionists, we also learned about the general situation of the school.</p>
<p>Most of the school's students are poor, out-of-school children who fled to Hong Kong and Kowloon under the Japanese army's artillery fire, and local poor children who are unable to attend school. The total number is about four hundred, divided into six areas for instruction. They are: Hong Kong District, located at 24, 3rd Floor, Po Hing Fong, Central. 152, 1st Floor, Third Street, Sai Ying Pun. 86 Wanchai Road, Kowloon District is located at: 676, 1st Floor, Shanghai Street, Mong Kok. 150, 2nd Floor, Woosung Street, Yau Ma Tei, and 161, 3rd Floor, Tai Nan Street, Sham Shui Po.</p>
<p>This refugee children's school was expanded from the tea house workers' volunteer school. The funds are generally donated by enthusiastic people from all walks of life, and the school's board members, such as Wen Dongxuan, Wen Yaoyang, Ling Kangfa, Liu Chongqi, and Ling Shudong, have been particularly helpful. The current monthly expenses are around one thousand yuan, and the teaching staff consists of approximately thirty people. Students are admitted free of charge, and books and supplies are also provided by the school.</p>
<p>Since the school's opening six months ago, the organization has been divided into senior and junior levels. The senior level is equivalent to grades three and four, and the junior level is equivalent to grades one and two. Classes are held in the evening, and the curriculum is similar to that of ordinary primary schools, with the addition of wartime knowledge, emphasizing the training of resistance awareness. After the graduation of the senior class, they plan to recruit new students again and hope to train them in more livelihood skills.</p>
<p>According to the principal's report at the meeting: "The number of refugee children in Hong Kong is estimated to be over tens of thousands. Please, overseas compatriots, sponsor the education of refugee children." We also sincerely pray that this kind of voluntary education can be widely expanded with the support of philanthropists and enthusiastic people. This is not only a charitable cause but also lays the foundation for the revival of the nation.</p>

<p>Three Major Qualities</p>
<p>Hu Chunbing: The so-called criticism has a different meaning from the commonly misused one. In the past, criticism could be roughly divided into two types: one was the old-fashioned, dogmatic preaching of the old gentlemen, using the ruler like those so-called progressive criticisms of the past few years. The other is abuse and attacks, which can only lead to anarchic chaos in the art world, such as the articles in Shanghai and Hong Kong tabloids, which are almost all personal attacks. The criticism we want to establish is to build theory in action. We can say that progressive criticism itself has three characteristics: (1) Progressive criticism is a review of work. Our era does not need (and cannot produce) detached critics who have no relationship with the actual work of the art department and only know how to quote scriptures and make judgments. Our critics must come from among the workers themselves. Criticism is self-criticism, a review of work, and an important program in the self-education of the entire art world. To faithfully report the actual work situation, to systematically investigate and organize the material conditions of the entire activity, and to indicate further work routes and methods from overcoming the difficulties and shortcomings of the work. To mobilize the first workers to participate in criticism activities and make criticism an organic part of the entire art activity. (2) Progressive criticism is constructive. It is itself a kind of work activity. Criticism is not a repetition of golden rules, but the inevitable accumulation of activities – work experience, recreated through the critic's thought system. It is indeed a kind of creation. This creation is not destructive but constructive, not abusive but kind, not rigid but active. This kind of criticism is not only an objective critique of artistic activities but also an effort of subjective activities. (3) Progressive criticism activities are an extension and in-depth growth of basic theory, and at the same time, they are the cornerstone and Originalaerm (seed) for establishing the guiding theory of artistic activities. Film and drama criticism cannot be separated from social life, so the progressive thinking methods and realistic materials of society will be the 'backstage' of criticism, but this kind of criticism is not just to end the old reality, but to build a new reality. Guiding theory is the guide for creating a new reality. Therefore, criticism activities must also be organizational activities.</p>
<p>There has not yet been established film and drama criticism in Southern China. We must use criticism activities to strengthen the effectiveness of our work, promote the unity of workers, and strive to have a broader group understand, accept, and support progressive drama and film!</p>
<p>Standards Should Not Be Too High</p>
<p>Fei Mu: Regarding film and drama criticism, I think it's very simple. I don't want to talk too much about theory, just to say a few honest words. Criticism is review, and the work of review is something we must actually do, but don't set too high a standard. For criticism of toxic works, I don't think we need to adopt an attacking attitude too harshly; sometimes we should forgive their difficulties.</p>
<p>The subject of this discussion is the upcoming performance by the China Art Troupe. I think we should focus on discussing that. The China Art Troupe's performance this time is technically superior to its content, which is really worthy of our respect. I would also like to propose that we ask the China Art Troupe to report on how they performed this time so that everyone's criticism has a basis.</p>
<p>Avoid Generalized Criticism</p>
<p>Situ Huimin: I think the problem of film and drama criticism is not as simple as Fei Guangsheng said, especially film criticism, because I am a film worker. Since the War of Resistance – especially after the Japanese army invaded the south – I feel that various problems that should be solved in my work should have an inseparable and close relationship with film criticism. On the surface, the issue of film and drama criticism seems simple, but in reality, there are many differences in the film and drama work here. For example, in terms of content, it is very obvious from many public performances recently that drama is not as strict as film in terms of examination and approval. Many more meaningful and positive works can be performed, but film is very difficult. In the past few months, all I have seen are things that have nothing to do with the War of Resistance or even are detrimental to the War of Resistance. On the other hand, after the war moved west, the domestic market shrank. Most producers take this as a reason for switching. So we must quickly decide what kind of works to do at this time. On the one hand, in order to make it meaningful to the War of Resistance, and on the other hand, we must strive for public screenings in various places. To achieve this, film criticism must play a great guiding role. This is very important.</p>
<p>What should also be specifically pointed out is that I believe many of the film and drama criticism issues that have been noted are generalized and do not pay attention to film and drama criticism under the confrontation with the Japanese devils, especially film and drama criticism in Hong Kong under foreign rule, where the Japanese devil's cultural offensive can occur at any time, and various restrictions can be added at any time, so our work has also become wartime, attacking in various ways at any time, and can also change our strategy due to restrictions. Film criticism is inseparable from our work, and in order to cooperate with the War of Resistance, it should not be as rigid and formal as general criticism. Regarding Ouyang Yuqian's views on overcoming the formulaic nature of film and drama, in addition to agreeing with Mr. Cai Chusheng's opinions, I would like to add something: sometimes, the performances in film and drama are more effective when they go in a curve than in a straight line, and more effective on the side than in the front, so that after the audience sees it, they have a feeling and think of a certain place. Now, in the process of resisting Japan and building the nation, all the activities of struggling hard in various fields, such as reading in caves, building roads, fighting with the Japanese devils in the snow... are all film and drama materials. It is not necessarily mechanical to pull out a Japanese devil and beat them up to our satisfaction, or to have a guerrilla team to be called a national defense drama. Soviet films are popular all over the world. Their films do not mechanically mark class struggles, but the audience naturally develops a sense of human justice. This is a clear example. Now, all those who expose the sins of decadence and corruption, making the audience feel related to themselves, are also drama materials. Just don't go beyond the biggest goal of 'resisting Japan and building the nation.'</p>
<p>Why use curves and take side approaches? Because art itself has its entertainment value, attracting people with elements of art such as sound, music, color, and twists and turns in the story, so that the plot and theme can be understood by the audience, establishing a close relationship.</p>
<p>This is the path we should take. If we don't succeed, we can try again. The path is made by people.</p>
<p>Strive for a Wider Audience</p>
<p>Tan Youliu: Regarding the discussion of establishing correct criticism of film and drama, many gentlemen have already expressed complete and valuable opinions. What I can offer now is just some supplementary material. We know that if a piece of work has not undergone criticism, it will not be improved and progressed; film and drama, of course, need sincere and earnest criticism to increase its later achievements and life. Among the producers of films and dramas (including writers, directors, actors, and talents in other departments), we can divide them into two parts: one part is 'upward,' they are never satisfied with their works and are always seeking progress; the other part is 'complacent,' they arrogantly believe that their works are 'perfect' and no one can compare with them. The former are 'thirsty for knowledge.' If there is no criticism after their works come out, they will feel frustrated and sad. They will try every means to find out the opinions of the audience and seek advice from like-minded people; but the latter are not. No matter how sincere criticism appears, making endless contributions to their works, they will 'disdain it' and even scold the critics aggressively for being 'busybody' or 'trying to get something'—Based on the attitudes of the above two types of producers, I believe that correct criticism should not only be established to discuss with the 'upward' and give lessons to the 'complacent,' but also, when necessary, attack them without hesitation. At the same time, it should also be written in various ways to interest ordinary audiences. Because film and drama cannot do without an audience, and among the audience, especially in South China, many people simply follow what others say, and they are even confused and do not know how to distinguish the quality of a work. If the writing and content of the criticism are lively and interesting instead of being rigid and only discussing specialized technical issues, then its effectiveness can naturally spread to the general audience, imperceptibly instilling in them knowledge of appreciating films and dramas. Since the audience has the knowledge of appreciation, they will naturally flock to carefully produced works. On the contrary, shoddy products will inevitably be rejected by customers and cannot continue to appear. In summary: We want to establish correct criticism, and this correct criticism must be written in various attractive ways, so that it not only makes contributions to film and drama itself, but also must strive to win more audiences for good works.</p>
<p>Coordinate with the National Struggle</p>
<p>Lian Guan: From the perspective of the entire cultural movement, our struggle should be continuously strengthened. As a department of the cultural movement, the film and drama movement, it is indeed very necessary and urgent to establish correct criticism today, because criticism is a weapon of struggle. We should use it flexibly in our own education, point out our direction, determine our steps, review our own weaknesses, correct general errors, expose all ugly postures, and combat and eliminate all slavish poisons that harm the nation. I think we should not regard this work as a small matter, nor should we think it is a simple problem. In fact, in the national liberation struggle, all work is difficult, but only if we persevere with a spirit of not being afraid of difficulties can any difficulty be overcome. We must recognize that the Japanese devils are using various conspiracies to hinder the progress and improvement of our culture, attempting to eliminate our national existence. At this time, there is a part of the backward and mediocre elements in the film industry who are helping the work that the Japanese devils want to do. Therefore, we must raise our political vigilance, and at any time and in any place, we are consistently fighting on the opposite front. We will mercilessly strike the Japanese devils. The Japanese devils will be defeated. This is a very obvious fact. First of all, we must unite and concentrate our own strength, strengthen and promote the development of this struggle, and coordinate the film and drama movement with the entire national liberation movement.</p>
<p>Three Important Conclusions</p>
<p>Lu Fu: On the issue of establishing progressive film and drama criticism, everyone has expressed so many valuable opinions. To sum up, we have already reached several important conclusions: First, the basis of our criticism should be established on the national liberation struggle. We must determine our needs based on the shift in the situation of the War of Resistance. At the same time, we must coordinate with the local environment and the opposing forces. Our standards should be broad, vivid, and not rigid slogans. Second, our attitude of criticism is constructive and creative. It is a rigorous review, not malicious attacks. It is sincere correction, not high-sounding talk. We must firmly support all progressive films and dramas, and at the same time, we must use our sincerity and kindness to encourage and awaken all backward film merchants and film workers. Third, the guiding principle of our criticism is to do our best to overcome all difficulties and shortcomings, to indicate a further work route and method, and at the same time, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of our work, we should strive to win over the broadest audience, so that every knowledgeable audience understands how to choose good spiritual food, so that our critical work plays a role and exerts a great power among the audience. These three conclusions can be said to be the practical gains of our first symposium—Because of the time, we can temporarily end this issue here. Later, we will need to practically implement this critical work!</p>
<p>(Note: The discussion on this topic has temporarily ended—The collective criticism on the performance of the China Art Troupe will be described in another article due to space limitations. End)</p>
<h3 id="e47">National Films of 1939 and "Human Voice"! <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Xin</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" battle, Shanghai, where the main force of the Chinese film industry was located, completely entered a state of stagnation in the last few months of 1937 due to the lack of overall planning after the incident. It was also because of this sudden shock that workers in Shanghai had the opportunity to spread to various parts of the country, and some people came to Hong Kong one after another—to find new materials and a new working environment. By the beginning of 1938, the Shanghai film industry gradually awakened from its sudden stagnation, but unfortunately, this awakening was even more intensified, almost on par with the so-called "Cantonese films," competing with each other. However, several directors who came to Hong Kong were able to take things seriously and prepared and waited for the opportunity for a long time for each of their films. 1939 was the time for them to move. In addition to Situ Huimin completing his glorious "Blood Splattered Baoshan City" and "Guerrilla Warfare March," and he and Tan Youren are already preparing for this year's new films, and those that will start in January next year include Cai Chusheng's "Orphan Island Hall," "Clouds of the South China Sea," and Fei Mu's "Human Voice."</p>
<p>This journal has already introduced "Clouds of the South China Sea." As for True Light Company's "Human Voice," it is a film with absolute contemporary significance. It requires great courage and the gathering of top-notch material resources, human resources, and financial resources to complete this grand plan.</p>
<p>Its screenwriter is Zhong Shigen, the author of "Humanity" and "Family Ethics." The director is Fei Mu, and the cast includes Zhang Yi, Li Zhuozhuo, and Li Keng from Shanghai, and Wu Chufan and others from Hong Kong. This is just a list of the main roles. A large number of other excellent actors are being recruited. The first-class cinematographer Zhou Daming is in charge of photography, and the other staff members are also selected talents, preparing to create this special film over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>We are not only saying that we can see many more conscientious and excellent films in 1939, but what is even more noteworthy is that this good force will give a great influence to the good forces of the film industry in the mainland, creating a new awareness and enabling another part of the film force to discover a new path and move forward together.</p>
<p>Finally, we must declare that we will not hesitate to publicize the new, conscientious, and responsible things because publicity is the task of the newspaper, and we feel even more honored to contribute to the power of publicity for good things, and hope to produce more things that can be publicized.</p>
<h3 id="e48">"Era" Theatre Troupe's Recent Work <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yun</p>
<p>——Grand public performance to be held from the 10th of this month——</p>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, Hong Kong's drama movement, through the hard work of general drama workers and influenced by foreign drama troupes, seems to have gradually embarked on a path of development. The performance achievements of the past year can be regarded as the prelude to the future development of the Hong Kong drama movement.</p>
<p>The beginning of 1939 has been formed by the second public performance of the 'China Art Troupe' and the joint grand public performance of amateur youth drama troupes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The atmosphere of the Hong Kong theater scene in 1939 is tense. Various theater troupes are also busy preparing for public performances, which is really a good phenomenon for the emerging art community.</p>
<p>The 'Era Theatre Troupe,' led by the famous dramatist Ouyang Yuqian and performing in Cantonese, is organized by Lu Dun, a former member of the local youth drama troupe. They have been able to work hard in the past, and their past achievements have also been very good. It is said that after the completion of the fifth performance of their first phase of work (regular public performance), Mr. Ouyang came to Hong Kong, so they planned the second phase of work again. Led by Ou Chongyuqian, they started rehearsing in February last year! Their first performance was held in Macau this January, and they performed for five consecutive days. It is said that the results were very good and the income was not small. Since they returned to Hong Kong, they have been preparing for a grand public performance in Hong Kong. Recently, I met a comrade from 'Era' who said that they have been rehearsing new plays day and night in the past few days, and they decided to perform at the Kowloon Popular Theatre for four consecutive days from the evening of the 10th of this month as the second phase of the ninth enlarged public performance. The plays performed in the four days are also different, and three of them are new plays, which they have recently rehearsed.</p>
<p>The play performed on the first day is Mr. Cao Yu's "Wilderness." This play is being performed in Hong Kong for the first time, and no other theater troupe has performed it in the past. Moreover, they adapted this script into a movie script last year called "Generations of Grievances," which is now a good script and is also being publicly performed recently. The characters performed this time are also the same as in "Generations of Grievances," and the directors are also Li Qing and Li Chenfeng. The performance results should not be weak, because they have been studying the script for more than a year.</p>
<p>The play on the second day is "Wilderness" in the afternoon and Cao Yu's "Sunrise" in the evening. This script has already been performed in Hong Kong by the "China Travel Troupe." However, it is still the first time to perform this play in Cantonese in Hong Kong, and it is also the first time for "Era" to perform this play. The director is Mr. Ouyang Yuqing, and he has also added the Southern actor Wu Chufan to participate in the performance.</p>
<p>The play on the third day is "Sunrise" in the afternoon and a very meaningful satirical comedy, "The New Official Takes Office," in the evening. This play was the most popular among the general audience when 'Era' performed it in Macau, and we introduced it in an article in the previous issue. It is said that this play is considered by the 'Era Theatre Troupe' to be their proud work. After Mr. Ouyang painstakingly rehearsed it for more than two days, it seems that this play is of course their best, right?</p>
<p>What will be performed on the fourth day is the 'Thunderstorm' that they have performed several times. The performance results in the past were not bad either. Perhaps it was because they wanted to complete the performance of Cao Yu's three complete works that they chose this play.</p>
<p>We admire the 'Era Theatre Troupe' for being able to continue to work hard in this spirit. However, we strongly hope that they will not only perform plays for the sake of drama but also perform more dramas for saving the nation, and perform drama for the sake of saving the nation. In particular, I hope that 'Era' will take on your responsibility as a sentinel and open up a new path for the Hong Kong drama movement in 1939.</p>
<p>Drama Movement Status</p>
<h3 id="e49">Yu Jing's New Work - "Tears on Flowers" Being Rehearsed by the China Travel Theater Troupe <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>In the production of anti-Japanese war dramas, Yu Jing's works, whether in terms of quality or quantity, are quite abundant. The most famous, such as "Night Light Cup," has been widely rehearsed by theater troupes across the country, and has also been performed many times in Hong Kong. Everyone believes that the playwright's consciousness, technique, and rhetoric are all very well-rounded and superior.</p>
<p>"Tears on Flowers" is Yu Jing's latest work, published in Shanghai under the pseudonym "Gan Ling." The content depicts the suffering of dancers, exposes the causes of urban sins, and points out a proper path for young people. It is a fine work that suits the demands of the times and is suitable for performance.</p>
<p>Naturally, due to environmental constraints, some places are not fully written. As he himself reported in the preface: "In some places, I was too timid, and the language was not detailed enough, which is very unpleasant!" However, there is no way to avoid this. In addition to regretting for the comrades trapped in the "isolated island," we can only hope, as the author does, that "the time when we can speak in detail, painfully and happily, will not be far away!" The same wish!</p>
<p>It is said that after the China Travel Theater Troupe "separated" and was "reconstructed," it began to process and rehearse this brand-new "Tears on Flowers." It is heard that the head of the troupe and the director of the play, Huai Qiu, is quite confident in its performance, believing that Carl is well-organized and full of "gimmicks," and will definitely be more interesting than "Night Light Cup." In that case, it should be able to achieve better results.</p>
<p>After reading the script, the writer felt a strong interest and would like to make a simple report like this first.</p>
<p>The Newborn Iron Current Theater Troupe</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance against Japan entered a brand-new second stage, it is reflected in the theater, a part of the salvation culture. In Hong Kong, there has also been a rapid development and an excellent work record. Recently, young theater workers in the Kowloon Peninsula have formed an "Iron Current Theater Troupe." It was born under the principle of integrating with "harmony and life," and being loyal to the War of Resistance. In the recruitment column of various newspapers these days, you can see the "Iron Current Theater Troupe's" advertisement for comrades, which fully demonstrates that their work is not closed, but attempts to widely gather all loyal theater workers to jointly create a brilliant theater movement. According to Jiu Jijiujiu, the head of the troupe, "Iron Current" has already started rehearsal work, and the plays scheduled to be performed in the near future are: "Long Live the Nation," "Women's Apartment," "Our Hometown," and "Sunrise."</p>

<p>— Wu Ma</p>
<p>I. Talking about the Past and Two Premises</p>
<p>Since the National Army moved west, the Zhejiang area, which has been known as the center of China's silk industry, has successively fallen. At that time, due to the urgency of time and the lack of preparation by the authorities, many silk companies that should have been moved inland were left in the war zone. Among them, in addition to silk factory industries, the most important thing to mention is of course the silkworm seed manufacturing plant. We know that many of the silk brushes remaining in the war zone, under the threat of the Japanese and the flattery of several silk industry traitors, are already officially acting as slaves to the Japanese economy under the name of "cooperating with the China Central Silk Company." For example, silk factories in Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou are now in operation, but this only shows that the oppression of the Japanese is increasing and the exploitation is deepening. What benefits have many traitors and scum ultimately obtained from the Japanese, whether in terms of , or in terms of reputation, I am afraid no one can say. We can understand this even more from the various harsh conditions and painful experiences of the silk factories in Wuxi after the so-called "cooperation." However, during the past year, the species circles in the war zone have been busy making the "China Central Company" because the Japanese are constantly busy. [Unfinished]</p>

<h3 id="e55">Today's Special Silver Plate Game Eastern and Southern China Re-settle the Disaster Relief Account The First Final of Group C is Held at the Kowloon Venue <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Sanyang is biased against Zhao Tai, and one Qi is opening up Yin. Today, on the one hand, we welcome the arrival of the Spring Festival, and on the other hand, we sigh at the easy passage of time. As the poem says, "Willow colors are tied to restrain the beautiful time, and then plant two rows towards the riverbank." Can young people in general not feel something after reading these two sentences?</p>
<p>However, since our country implemented a long-term war of resistance against Japan, we are absolutely confident in winning the final victory, because "time is the enemy of Japan." The more we endure during the War of Resistance, the closer the collapse of the invaders is. Therefore, in the sorrow of the passage of time, I find a little comfort instead.</p>
<p>The Spring Festival is a good time, and the unlimited scenery, the national soccer team, is just right to take advantage of the time to have fun. In today's soccer events, there is a special silver plate game, and there are leagues, all of which are very important and not trivial. I believe the performances in each game will definitely be pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>The Silver Plate is Eastern against Southern China. This soccer debt, because it was not settled in the previous calculation, resulted in the battle to determine the winner again today. Moreover, the result of the battle is who will be eliminated.</p>
<p>I remember in the previous match, Southern China scored two goals first, taking the lead. Unexpectedly, Lin Depu was injured and unable to walk, and he lost the pillar of the river. The battle situation changed accordingly. Eastern took the opportunity to recover the lost ground and tied the score at 2-2, creating a war situation with no conclusion. At that time, the two teams were too eager to win, and the performance was out of shape, leaving a very deep impression on people. I hope that today, the players of both teams will adhere to the spirit of sports, and not have the excessive behavior of that time. It is very fortunate.</p>
<p>Today, Eastern will still field the same lineup as the one that defeated Southern China last time. As for Southern China, there are slight changes. Lin Depu, who was injured in the previous battle against Eastern, has not fully recovered and will be replaced by Yang Genbao as the center. Also, Qu Shie will replace Li Shuoyou, who was penalized in the previous battle against Eastern. Therefore, the entire lineup is not as perfect as the last time.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of winning or losing, I do not want to make a conclusion in advance, because both are Chinese teams. No matter who wins, they are treated equally. The goal is to develop pure technology to win. This is good ability. A victory that is not moral is not worth taking.</p>
<p>The league between and Scott is also very important, but it is not known whether Scott's performance will be like last time. If they take one point from each army again, Southern China will indirectly benefit from it. The battle between Guanghua and St. Joseph is also a battle of equal strength.</p>
<p>The first final of Group C will be held at the Kowloon venue today, which is quite important. It is a battle between the Aircraft Team and the Scott Team, which is also a very stimulating war.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Southern China's game against Kowloon Society's special silver plate soccer game was re-battled yesterday, and another draw was achieved. After fighting each other twice, there was no conclusion. It was really a muddled account.</p>
<p>Judging from the lineup of Southern China yesterday, it can be considered complete. Zheng Longxiang, who replaced Liu Qingcai, was always working hard and did not show any flaws. The most abnormal person was Luo Douwen, who lost opportunities frequently, ran weakly, and passed inaccurately. Guo Yingqi's dribbling was robbed, cutting off the traffic on the left. However, Yingqi still worked hard, and the performance was slightly better than the one last week. Since Douwen did not have a good foot, he made Deng Guangsen on the right wing transport alone, panting and sweating. This kind of deformed attack greatly affected the chance of winning the ball. Carefully observing the reasons why Southern China failed to win, it is not entirely due to the deformed development of the front. The only weakness is that the forwards have no grasp of shooting. It is said that the greatest opportunity to penetrate and take it has been two or three times, but both Li Zhaorong and Guo Yingqi missed it. As for long shots, none were seen in the entire game. The responsibility of being a forward is to break the enemy's goal. If they do not learn shooting skills, it is useless to just focus on developing transportation skills. I believe that Southern China has hopes in this competition and the league. For the sake of great achievements, their front line will not be successful without Li Hui coming back. If the does not allow force, then their original should work hard to practice shooting, otherwise the future is dangerous.</p>
<p>Liang Rong , who is in the center, is getting better and better. The backbone of the whole team is thus supporting effectively, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Kowloon initially used Bell, the former Shanghai inter-port representative, as the center , but there was no wonderful performance. Although this gentleman is young and energetic, he has not mastered the skills that a forward should have. The head went to work, which was lacking. Dribbling skills were rarely seen. There was no way to break through the center. The writer believes that Bell's footwork is purely a midfielder style , and it is not normal to be a forward .</p>
<p>Kowloon was able to draw entirely due to Helly's human-saving skills. In the 23rd minute of the second half, was inspired by Rong's wonderful pass and shot a corner kick from the front of the goal (about three feet high). The audience thought it was a sure win, but Helly twisted his long waist, leaped and pounced, saving the dangerous ball. The posture was wonderful. If Southern China had benefited from this ball, it would have been able to maintain the victory.</p>
<p>Referee Ge Ximing blew his whistle, and the battle broke out. Kowloon attacked first, deeply and not by hand. The five forwards were very active. In five minutes, they forced two corner kicks, and the audience was alarmed. When the battle reached ten minutes, Southern China suddenly broke out and began to counterattack. Douwen forced a corner kick. After kicking it out, Helly pounced to seize the danger, but was blocked by the Southern China forward. He lost the and fell, and Guangsen happened to be standing in an empty space, greeted the ball, and shot towards the empty goal, stopping in the red heart. He couldn't turn back and lost a goal first, 1-0, Southern China took the lead. After a while, Jingxiang and Zhaorong advanced together, and Guangsen forced a corner kick. After kicking it out, Yingqi jumped up and headed it, but was caught by He. In the 25th minute, Feng Shen legs, in the chaotic army, even passed the defenders and handed it to Yingqi to shoot, but the ball was powerless and was once again caught by's wonderful hand. The horn of the half-time sounded.</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, Bellis made a cold shot in the ninth minute, almost hitting the target. In the twelfth minute, Douwen passed a ball, but Zhaorong was not in a good position, and the ball slipped from the instep of his foot , He saved it, missing a chance to win. In the fifteenth minute, Kowloon attacked, and the momentum was turbulent. Bell seized the opportunity to shoot , and in the midst of the crowd, the ball rebounded, and Liao Yachen stepped forward to snatch the shot, hitting the target, tying the score 1-1. In the 23rd minute, Yingqi got the pass from Fei Rong and showed his power in front of the goal. The ball was as fast as an arrow , but it was saved by Helly , and there was a sigh. After playing for 70 minutes, the two teams were still tied. The extra 20 minutes, in turn, was the winner. The members were all tired , and there was no gain. The third confrontation will be the next victory . The battle lines of both sides yesterday are as follows.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Student Tennis Team has been in Hong Kong for several days. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, they faced the Hong Kong University team for the first time at the HKU Sports Ground. The competition consisted of three singles and two doubles matches. The fierce battle lasted until around 6 PM, and the result was that all five matches were won by the student team. A brief account of each match is given below:</p>
<p>First Singles</p>
<p>Shanghai's Tang Baojia versus HKU's Wang Jinxi. Tang is this year's Shanghai Chinese singles champion, with extraordinary strength and excellent skills. Wang is the top player at HKU, skillful but ultimately not a match for Tang. After the start, Wang only managed to win the first game of his serve, after which Tang won five consecutive games, then added one more, making it five to two. Tang then won the first set with six to two. In the second set, Tang, riding the momentum of winning the first set, won the first two games. Wang struggled to catch up, tying the score at two all. At this point, Tang showed no mercy, unleashing powerful shots and winning six consecutive games, securing the second set with two to zero. It only took half an hour.</p>
<p>Tang Baojia Six-Two Six-Two Wang Jinxi</p>
<p>Second Singles</p>
<p>Shanghai's Li Guopan versus HKU's Ma Chaozhuang. Li is also a well-known Shanghai Chinese player, often compared to Tang Baojia. Yesterday, Li was not accustomed to the ground, so he was unable to fully demonstrate his strength. In the first set, HKU's Ma Chaozhuang seized it with six to four. At the start of the second set, Ma won the first game, and Li made it two to zero. Ma tied it at two all. Li suddenly unleashed his power, winning four consecutive games to reclaim the set with six to two. The third set was the final decider. After the start, Li continued to lead, with Ma chasing closely, from two all to four all to five to four, with Li taking the lead by one game. Ma then caught up to tie it at five all. Li seized the opportunity to win the next two games, ultimately winning the final set with seven to five.</p>
<p>Li Guopan Four-Six Six-Two Seven-Five Ma Chaozhuang</p>
<p>Third Singles</p>
<p>Shanghai's Wei Zhenxing versus HKU's Wang Xianbi. The skills of both players were comparable, and the match was very close. In the first set, both players won based on their serves. Wei took the lead and won the set seven to five. The second set was equally close, with multiple ties. At four all, Wei intensified his pressure, cleverly winning the set six to four. In the final set, Wang appeared slightly fatigued, while Wei became increasingly courageous, leading all the way and securing the victory with six to four.</p>
<p>Wei Zhenxing Five-Seven Six-Four Six-Four Wang Xianbi</p>
<p>First Doubles</p>
<p>Shanghai's Tang Baojia and Li Guopan versus HKU's Wang Jinxi and Ma Chaozhuang. The match was hard-fought. In the first set, after a grueling eighteen games, Tang and Li narrowly won with ten to eight. In the second set, Tang and Li were slightly careless, allowing Wang and Ma to tie the match with six to three. At the start of the third set, both sides were exhausted and struggled to cope. Tang and Li ultimately prevailed due to their superior skill and physical strength, completing the match with six to three.</p>
<p>Tang Baojia Li Guopan Ten-Eight Three-Six Six-Three Wang Jinxi Ma Chaozhuang</p>
<p>Second Doubles</p>
<p>Shanghai's Wei Zhenxing and Cai Guoji versus HKU's Wang Xianbi and Lin Jun. After the start, HKU's Wang and Lin had strong momentum and won the first few games. Wei and Cai worked hard to catch up and tied the score. The HKU team then made it four to two, but Wei and Cai accelerated their efforts, winning the first set with six to four. In the second set, Wang and Lin once again took the lead, initially leading four to zero. Wei and Cai then tied the score at four all. From then on, the two sides battled fiercely, four to four, five to five, six to five, all the way to eight all. Finally, Wei and Cai won two consecutive games to win with ten to eight.</p>

<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>The Shanghai student team is scheduled to play the South China Athletic Association team today at 2:30 PM at the South China Athletic Association tennis court at King's Park. It is said that there will be slight adjustments to the Shanghai team's lineup, approximately: Tang Baojia for the first singles, Li Guopan for the second singles, Shi Zhigen for the third singles, Tang and Li for the first doubles, and Cai Guofan, due to his recent recovery from illness, will be replaced by Shi Zhigen partnering with Wei Zhenxing for the second doubles.

<p>Entertainment—The Rich Girl's Secret</p>
<p>There Goes My Heart</p>
<p>Is an American comedy film. The story and plot arrangement are entirely for the purpose of achieving comedy. The director's surprising and winning techniques have created a lot of fresh laughs for the audience in this film. The crazy and humorous plot also has a great power to attract people.</p>
<p>The film depicts the escape of a naive and freedom-loving rich girl, and how she falls in love with a reporter under special circumstances.</p>
<p>Fredric March and Virginia Bruce are not very good comedians. They didn't achieve much in the film, and their performances were mediocre. Patsy Kelly is bright and cheerful, and has a very good performance. She is a cute clown. Nancy Carroll plays a vain and jealous saleswoman, which is her second performance since returning to the screen, and the results are not bad.</p>
<p>Queen's Weekly Screening……</p>
<p>Peace……Sixty Glorious Years</p>
<p>Sixty Glorious Years</p>
<p>This film also depicts the glorious history of Queen Victoria's life, but it is more detailed than the previous one. It includes many important achievements during her sixty years in power. In order to be solemn and true, it was filmed by the British Royal Company, but it is somewhat colored by propaganda of British Queen's history.</p>
<p>Because the material is particularly rich, and those materials are all treasures, and cannot be discarded or deleted, under this situation, the director is not easy to please and handle properly. This film has made this mistake. Except for the first half of the play that describes the Queen's life after marriage, which is slightly lively and vivid, the second half is simply a fragmented history, used as an institutional introduction. It cannot be blamed on the director's skills.</p>
<p>The whole play has several very excellent scenes, such as the Queen's life after marriage, the charge of the British Royal Army, the Queen's Jubilee celebration, and her visit to her old palace maids, which are all worth mentioning. In terms of actors, there is not much change from the previous "Queen Victoria". Anna Neagle, who plays the Queen, gives an excellent performance, especially in her old age. Anton Walbrook, who plays Prince Albert, is also very good.</p>
<p>Oriental……And That Certain Age</p>
<p>That Certain Age</p>
<p>What is depicted here is a precocious girl who falls in love with a reporter twice her age. He didn't know it at first, and after discovering it, he tried his best to make her give up, but it didn't work. In the end, another woman came to the rescue.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Deanna Durbin is even more beautiful in this film. Not only is her performance delicate and lively, but she also has made significant progress. Melvyn Douglas, the male lead, is very competent, like Mabel Hersch in "Merry Go Round". Jackie Cooper still reveals a naive acting skill.</p>
<p>The four new songs inside are also very beautiful.</p>
<p>Great China……Swiss Miss</p>
<p>Swiss Miss</p>
<p>The second to last comedy film of the old Laurel and Hardy era. The story tells the story of two ice cream vendors (Laurel and Hardy). Once they went to Switzerland to do business. The two self-righteous fools made a lot of jokes. Some places are indeed lacking, but it is precisely because it is a comedy.</p>
<p>There are also two European singers participating in the performance, especially the woman's singing is very good. The performances of the two ice cream vendors are the same as always.</p>
<p>New World……Modern Woman Seeking Husband</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>It is adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Seeking Husband". The plot tells the story of a millionaire with millions of assets, who is extremely stingy. He is unwilling to contribute a penny to all public welfare undertakings, and even tries to take advantage of others. At this time, because all sectors launched fundraising to establish a Chinese industry, they wanted to ask him for help. However, not only did he not take out a penny, but he even grabbed a few snacks at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devised this "Modern Woman Seeking Husband" plan to trick him and then use female beauty to lure him.</p>
<p>The main performers are the stage stars Ma Shizeng and Tan Lanqing. It is also a family business of the film company.</p>
<p>The director's technique is quite clear.</p>
<p>Central……Black Shirt Team</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>What is shown in this film is the two disparate classes in society, on the one hand, the hard-working masses of women, on the other hand, some idle class pretentious and lewd masters and young masters, but the director's depiction of each plot is inevitably too much to achieve the goal of "fragrant" and ignores the reality of the performance, but also for the sake of too much "sensual", the film is full of low-level vulgar, flirtatious nonsense,</p>
<p>The plot depicts a weak woman whose husband goes abroad to make a living, and her family is bad, forcing her to work as a maid, and suffering all kinds of insults and oppressions, and when her husband returns home, all kinds of misunderstandings occur.</p>
<p>Half of the plot is loose, and most of it is performed in the form of opera, trying to cover up the emptiness of the content, and the director's technique is not refined enough, but the heroine Huang Manli's outstanding performance in this film cannot be buried and is worth reading.</p>

<p>Although the methods for remedying overexertion are very simple, it is always easier to prevent than to remedy. Moreover, it is too late when you need to remedy it, and our body has already suffered considerable harm.</p>
<p>The methods to prevent overexertion are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) When exercising, limit yourself to 60% to 75% of your full strength. However, this only refers to regular practice. During competitions or approximately every two weeks, you can exercise with full strength once.</p>
<p>(2) Do not force yourself to exercise when you are not feeling well.</p>
<p>(3) The exercise time and exercise procedure should have certain regulations.</p>
<p>(4) The posture should be correct and the movements should be thorough when exercising. If the exercise is too strenuous, it will affect the posture and movements.</p>
<p>(5) Do not hold your breath while exercising.</p>
<p>(6) People suffering from neurasthenia, heart disease, anemia, insomnia, indigestion, constipation, and other symptoms should not do strenuous exercise, or must completely stop exercising.</p>
<p>In addition to rest and correcting exercise errors, deep breathing exercises and water baths or hot water baths are also very effective for remedies. Deep breathing exercises can both inhale a large amount of fresh air and completely expel "acid gas", making the blood clean and the circulatory function normal and active, so that the heart and other major organs become strong and our body is easier to recover. Warm water or hot water baths can relax the body and are very helpful for people suffering from insomnia and anemia. However, hot water baths should not be excessive, otherwise the body will be weaker. Cold water baths have a great stimulating effect on the body and cause a great reaction, so they are very unsuitable for people with weak bodies. In addition, relaxation exercises (Relaxation Exercises) are also very beneficial for those suffering from overexertion. In short, the main way to remedy overexertion is to strengthen the heart and nervous system and make circulatory breathing, digestion, and other functions normal and active. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e61">On Overcoming Work <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Youqiu</p>
<p>In an era of revolution, an era of progress, on one hand, the revolutionary ranks advance valiantly; on the other hand, "the dregs rise up." This dawn of a new era, the torch of truth has not yet illuminated everything, and some people will lack their due awareness, even among the revolutionary ranks. "People will always desert, flee, become decadent, or betray." (Lu Xun). It is certain that in the general flow of progress, there will inevitably be remnants of regression and darkness, and in a particular department, there may even be a shrinkage, a reversal. However, this is an unbreakable truth: all things always follow "the infinite process from the lower to the higher," "before which nothing can resist"; "although there are sometimes superficial coincidences and temporary regressions, in the final analysis, it still develops forward," these are Engels' words.</p>
<p>The question is whether this "regression" will affect the upward movement? Undoubtedly, it will delay this movement. When we return to the realistic subject of the War of Resistance, it is even clearer that the "regression" in each sub-department not only affects itself but also affects the progress of the overall movement of the War of Resistance, causing it to be more or less delayed.</p>
<p>The question is how should this "regression" be overcome? Reality urgently demands this overcoming. When we carefully examine it, through the appearance of "regression," we will inevitably discover the driving force for forward development. To discover the upward quality and to defeat the regressing quantity, a process of "qualitative change" must be created. Here, I want to emphasize the significance of overcoming work. "Upward" and "regressing" are opposing and competing processes. We can break the basis of "regression" and seize its base, building new structures on the ruins. Only by overcoming it through work can we enable the "dregs" to lose their weapons and sink back into the riverbed of time. Only then can we enable those who lack awareness to gain their new life!</p>
<p>The above is a general exploration. Let us take reality to analyze. In the various departments of art, literature, music, drama, film, etc., there is a specific new quality of upward movement. However, we can easily find a phenomenon of regression in the film industry. As Mr. Cai Chusheng pointed out: "Except for the China Film Production Studio of the government and the Central Film Studio, which are bravely shouldering glorious tasks, the film culture movement, which was booming for a while, has all entered the path of destruction, regardless of the north or south." Everyone can feel this. However, we should analyze this "regression" phenomenon. We can only admit that it is "superficial, temporary, and accidental." The film culture movement has a new quality of forward development. The progressive films after the January 28th Incident were due to the competition and struggle of work that pushed back the regressive films of gods, monsters, and chivalry; however, for the drastic change of the War of Resistance, the films of gods, monsters, and chivalry used folk stories to revive themselves, doing the "regression," and the progressive films shrank back due to the objective environment. To overcome this "regression," we still have to restore the previous work competition and struggle! This means striving for the audience, cultivating the audience's correct discernment of beauty and ugliness, so as to shatter the foundation on which the dregs stand and enable the unconscious to accept the lessons of reality and awaken "self-criticism." Overthrowing toxic films, of course, starts from criticism, but needs to be completed by producing progressive films! This overcoming of work is just explaining "the unity of theory and practice."</p>
<h3 id="e62">Talking About "Good Reportage" <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Lao</p>
<p>Several years ago, some critics once advocated that writers could fire a gun in one hand and write a novel in the other. But later, it turned out that there were no such geniuses, which proved that it was just critics dreaming. Naturally, there were writers who wrote poems on horseback in legends, but writing poems is possible, writing novels is impossible, and even the poems written would not be "great" poems. The reason is very simple: novels most need "artistic description," and writers who really want to do the work of "writing" need to have some factual conditions.</p>
<p>Barbusse's "Under Fire" was not written during the Great War; Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" was not written during the Great War. Taking the current Spanish War as an example, the writers who have always stayed in Spain have not seen the writing of "No Pasaran" that kind of "reportage masterpiece." Dutch famous writer Jef Last went to Spain to participate in the war, but only wrote a few letters—naturally, that can be said to be "good reportage," but it is not "No Pasaran" that kind of "reportage masterpiece."</p>
<p>Even if it is not "great" reportage, it still has to go through the two ladders of general writing: First, there must be a reportage material: currently, the materials are naturally everywhere, but what is lacking is a little time to sit down and write a piece of literature, in other words, a little time to "write straight with a pen." If literature can be written without a little time to sit down, then that is truly a "mysterious thing." There are some writers who now live in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and they may have time to write with peace of mind, but they are, after all, a minority, and not all of them have always specialized in "writing literature." In my opinion, a literary writer who has "honestly participated in the war for eighteen months" will certainly have inexhaustible materials, but the time to sit down must be very short.</p>
<p>I am not saying that the current reportage should be like a running account, lacking artistic description and lacking the power to move people. I am just saying that we should not be too strict with the writers who are running on the front lines of the struggle. It is naturally best to have a "reportage masterpiece" like "No Pasaran," but if not, as long as there are true letters, true chronicles, as long as they still use literary techniques, and are not considered bad works, then it is okay to temporarily recognize them as passable reportage. Those works that are vivid and colorful, that are "brilliant," are naturally also the best. But here, however, old writers are often unwilling to go to the front lines like them, there is a factual problem. Most of those who have participated in the war for eighteen months are young writers, so their techniques are probably inevitably worse. Or because they want to prepare for future "masterpieces," they are unwilling to write those letters and chronicles, which is something that cannot be helped, so we can only temporarily satisfy ourselves with those works that are not "vivid and colorful" and not "brilliant." In other words, but this is only temporary: those writers will soon use their moving lives to transform their "stories" under their "pen tips" into "vivid and colorful" and "brilliant."</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that if you "cannot help but feel a little ashamed" because you "simply see very little good reportage," then it should not be "ashamed" for general writers in general, but should be "ashamed" for a few backward writers (here, let me leave a word in advance to answer other counter-questions: if I am also a writer, I admit that I am also one who cannot be let go).</p>
<p>As for saying that there are too many "generals' interview notes, etc.," I think that is a true statement. Taking a photo with a general, asking the general to inscribe a word or a poem, and then also writing a poem yourself. Re-producing it carefully with copperplate is ultimately irrelevant to reportage. "Interviews" are naturally important. But I think it is best to interview the soldiers more. From the soldiers' surroundings, we can certainly get more important materials, and those materials will certainly enable the interviewer to write "good reportage," although it is not necessarily "great reportage."</p>
<h3 id="e63">Crossing the Wo River <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou——</p>
<p>In the sky, a few stars were scattered sparsely. A crescent moon rose from behind the trees, casting a mercury-like radiance over the ground. The wheat seedlings had lost their tenderness and vitality, lying still in the fields. Treading on the tree shadows, which looked like light ink stains on the road, the队伍 moved silently and quickly forward. In the distant villages, there were occasional barks of dogs, as if "bandits" had passed through there.</p>
<p>With a tense heart, always ready for a bloody battle, I followed excitedly, unaware of when we had safely passed the small villages scattered along the road where it was said that "bandits" were lying in ambush.</p>
<p>The next morning, as the sun emerged with golden rays, the队伍 reached the Xin Ting road. To prevent "bandits'" tanks from rushing in, the road had been dug up section by section. At this time, several civilians, hearing that our队伍 was going to take this road, were voluntarily filling the dug-up pits with earth.</p>
<p>Moved by this rare enthusiasm, Commander Zhang took out thirty dollars and handed it to them:</p>
<p>"You have worked hard. Take this small amount of money and buy something to eat."</p>
<p>"You are helping us fight the bandits, how can we take your money?" The civilians, gripping their hoes, declined with smiles.</p>
<p>"Don't be polite," Commander Zhang put the money in the hand of an old man. "Hurry up and dig, our heavy artillery will be coming soon."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." The civilians nodded and raised their hoes to dig.</p>
<p>Not far from those civilians, one or two vendors were selling things like cigarettes by the roadside. At this time, the brothers who had withdrawn from southern Shandong, having not seen a civilian selling anything for a long time, seemed to have found some treasure, and they surrounded them layer upon layer, competing to buy. The rare excitement would probably surprise even the cigarette vendor!</p>
<p>Climbing over Longshan, which lay abruptly in the fields, we arrived at Longshan Town. The civilians standing by the street looked at us with frightened faces, as if asking if we were "bandits."</p>
<p>"Folks, don't be afraid! We are here to fight the bandits."</p>
<p>"Oh, you've worked hard!" A middle-aged man turned his head and shouted to his family: "Don't be afraid, they are our troops, here to fight the bandits for us, quickly bring tea!"</p>
<p>"No need for tea, folks, just give us some cold water to drink!"</p>
<p>"Okay, bring out a bucket of cold water!"</p>
<p>Two tightly closed doors were opened, and a little girl came out carrying a bucket of cold water. Then, this family and that family also opened their doors, fetching water to comfort us.</p>
<p>Just as I was sitting in front of a house drinking water, suddenly, a "bandit" plane flew over and circled above. The people and horses standing on the street quickly hid in the houses. The "bandit" plane strafed with machine guns for a while, and then flew away on its own without any result.</p>
<p>After resting for a while in Longshan Town, in the scorching sun, the队伍 set off again. There was no wind at all, and people were sweating profusely, even their clothes were soaked with sweat.</p>
<p>Dragging my feet, which were blistered and oozing yellow fluid, I struggled to walk on the terribly hot highway, longing to finally satisfy my hunger of more than ten days when we reached the Wo River. But upon reaching Woyang, tens of thousands of houses had been bombed into scorched earth by "bandit" planes. Some houses were still smoldering with residual smoke. The scene was filled with ruins and broken wood that made people want to weep, and there wasn't a single civilian to be seen. Oh, what shall we use to repay our "bandits" for this great destructive achievement?</p>
<p>Suddenly, machine gun fire rang out from behind. No need to be told: the brothers behind us must have come into contact with the "bandits" again.</p>
<p>The people who had just arrived at the Wo River jumped into the turbid Wo River one after another, soaking their clothes in the water, wading across the river, and quickly dispersing into the trench on the high ground outside the city...</p>
<p>Strangely, the gunfire suddenly subsided again.</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Enchanted Forest <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——Talking about Ethnic Novels</p>
<p>"The Enchanted Forest" was written by Li Baichuan of the Qing Dynasty. There is an old manuscript copy kept in the Yenching University Library, with the author's own preface. Other versions only have the Tao preface of the twenty-ninth year of Qianlong and the Hou preface of the thirty-sixth year of Qianlong. Now it is only known that Baichuan was from Jiangnan, but his name is unknown. (See Sun Kaidi's Bibliography of Popular Novels, page 249)</p>
<p>Chapters 54 to 59, these six chapters, are about suppressing bandits in Zhejiang. Historical figures include Yu Dayou, Lin Run, Zhang Jing, Yan Song, Zhao Wenhua, Hu Zongxian, Hai Rui, etc. Fictional characters also include Zhu Wenwei, Lin Dai, etc. About one part of the characters are true and five parts are false. The truthful parts are mostly specifically pointed out in the book. For example, Hai Rui's memorial to the emperor can be found in Ming History, Volume 226. Chapter 56, which describes Wenhua presenting wine, is based on Ming History, Volume 308, the biography of Zhao Wenhua: "Wenhua wanted to win the emperor's favor and presented Hundred Flower Immortal Wine. He falsely said: 'Your minister shuai Song took it and gained longevity.' The emperor drank it and found it sweet, and softly asked Song. Song secretly said: 'How could Wenhua have done this?' He then indirectly reported: 'Your minister has never been fond of medicine. How could this old horse know why?' Song hated Wenhua for not telling him first, summoned him to his place and scolded him. Wenhua knelt and wept, not daring to get up for a long time. Xu Jie and Li Ben saw this and mediated, and then let him leave. When Song returned from his leave, the nine ministers came to pay their respects. Song was still angry at Wenhua and ordered his followers to drag him out. Wenhua was greatly embarrassed and bribed Song's wife to intercede for him. Wenhua immediately came out to pay his respects. Song then treated him as before."</p>
<p>The novel Xiaohua says: "In the book, the criticism of Hu Meilin is without reservation, I don't know what is meant by this? Although Meilin's achievements are not enough to be admired, his merits and demerits are enough to offset each other. Among the Jiedushi at the time, he cannot be said not to be outstanding, and it is not right to obliterate him with a single stroke." It is guessed that Hu Zongxian cooperated with Yan Song and was considered a member of the Yan faction. "The novel repeatedly criticizes him" is due to this. However, Hu Zongxian employed Qi Jiguang and Yu Dayou, which can also be said to be knowing people and being good at employing them.</p>
<p>The chapter "Suppressing Bandits, the Three Marshals Achieve Great Deeds" is largely fictional. In this chapter, Lin Dai leads more than a hundred generals outside Jiangning City and kills the Yi leaders Miao Mei, Xu Hai, Wang Zhen, etc. in the midst of fifty to sixty thousand troops, which is obviously inconsistent with historical facts. The so-called three marshals refer to Yu Dayou, Lin Dai, and Zhu Wenwei. According to the biography of Yu Dayou in Ming History, "He defeated Zhou Yude's troops of thirty warships, the Nanjiang Metropolitan Commander." In this way, the governor Lu Fengyi, who guarded Nanjing, was also somewhat unreliable.</p>
<p>But the stories in these six chapters are generally correct. For example, Zhang Jing being wronged and Lin Run impeaching Yan Song are famous historical facts.</p>
<p>The book describes Zhao Wenhua bribing the bandits with six hundred thousand taels of gold, asking them to pretend to be defeated in order to claim credit, which can be said to be scolding this traitor severely. And the description of the three marshals eradicating the bandits is also extremely satisfying: "The officers and soldiers killed them scattered and disorganized. After running five or six miles, seeing that the soldiers were gradually far away, they each found the riverside, with only two or three seagoing ships. The bandits fought to cross, killing each other. The sound of weeping shook the heavens and the earth, but there were too many people for the boats, and many ships sank. Some bandits were starving and fell along the way, or those who could not move were all beheaded by the officers and soldiers, no less than four or five thousand people. At dawn, the pursuing soldiers arrived again and searched everywhere. As the bandits in the ships were trying to escape, they suddenly heard the river shaking, a thunderous cannon, the river was full of warships, and cannons and rockets rained down, and those who were hit by arrows and cannons were wounded and damaged, losing nine out of ten. When they arrived at Jiaoshan, they were shattered by Dayou's cannons, and not a single ship escaped in the waterway, nor a single person survived. Dayou had ambushes at the entrances of the seas, killing many escaped bandits." (Excerpt from Chapter 55) (This great defeat is no different from Cao Aman's great defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, which makes people excited.)</p>
