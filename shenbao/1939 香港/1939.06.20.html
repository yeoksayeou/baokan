<p>社評</p>
<h3>天津事件與遠東</h3>
<p>上海，鼓浪嶼，乃至天津事件一串的所謂租界問題，最初原只是日本軍閥為打開日本侵華軍事的碰壁而開演的。但想不到在鼓浪嶼受到挫折，而現在在天津竟然帶上了「强味」。這裏的理由非常簡單而明瞭：在鼓浪嶼的塲合之下，英國的態度不但强硬，並且能與美法採取着密切的聯繫與共同的行動，例如共同派遣陸戰隊上陸：但在天津方面，英國與美法沒有密切的聯絡，英國自己的態度也非常軟弱。英國初郎先答應引渡反日份子，繼又只希望美國出頭調解。終則猶豫不决地只在考慮什麽報複的手段，老是「雷聲大而雨點小」。</p>
<p>引渡中國反日份子已經碰到了日本的硬釘子，日方並不能滿足於這種引渡，日方所要求的是英方遠東政策的所謂「根本改變」。卽美國出頭調解的希望，也因日方的拒絕而成了泡影。猶豫不决的報復手段，更遇到了日方更嚴厲的恐嚇：「英政府若採取迅速積極的步驟以保護其在華權益，則日本將被逼而採取各種必要手段，以應付新局面」（日本官方的聲稱）。然則此後問題的展開如何？英國應採的步驟又是如何？</p>
<p>天津事件己不只是天津一地方的問題，也不只是英日兩國的問題，實質上，它已是第三國全體與日本的問題，遠東整個的問題，同時也是侵略集團與反侵略集團對抗的問題。因此，英國要對付這一嚴重的問題，必須注意這個大前提。英國不必恐懼日本的恫嚇，英國目前所切要的是趕快調整反侵略集團的步伐，特別是與遠東有密切關係的國家切實聯結起來。英法駐遠東的軍事領袖會商合作的辦法，同然重要，這個會商還不能缺少美國。美國是日本最畏懼的國家，英國要施經済制裁於日本，更非美國的合作，效力不能大。</p>
<p>此外，蘇聯在遠東關係上沾着重要的位置，她的雄偉力量，對於遠東的局勢是舉足輕重的，因對華軍事陷於停頓而欲移其鋒尖於第三國的日本軍閥，對於蘇聯仍不脫離虛聲暄嚷，對於英國則劍及履及地蠻幹。日本對英國的蠻幹，固一面在牽制英國之親近蘇聯，但從此又可以看出它恐懼英蘇合作的另一面。為英國增强聲勢計，英蘇的談判不應當遲遲不進，給侵畧者看淸反侵畧集團不調和的缺點。</p>
<p>英國沒有理由恐懼日本。日本政府雖以對立的統一支持着軍閥的蠻幹政策，但其內部的根本矛盾則因為侵華軍事的困難而將更增大。英國能擴大日本侵華的困難，它的遠東政策的基礎就可鞏固。</p>
<h3>魯西北通訊　北渡黃河記</h3>
<p>一、出發</p>
<p>星光，在深沉的夜空中閃動着，那光亮的鋒芒，潔美而銳利。大地上，靜悄悄的，一些沒有聲息。只是暮秋的凉風却在輕輕的吹聾着我們單薄的軍衣裏的軀體。該是有點兒冷了——但是，誰的身子這麽嬌嫩？我們是健壯的，胶子裏裝滿着是憤怒復仇的熱血，這點點冷風算得了甚麽？</p>
<p>順着彎曲的城牆外的馬路踏着勁健的步子向前進似乎忘記了肩背上還有沉重的行囊，大家吭起了喉嚨高歌：</p>
<p>「祖國在死亡綫上，同胞在飢餓彷徨，五千年的民族要翻身，四萬萬五千萬的人民要解放！兩重任務落在我們的肩上全國的姊妹兄弟，我們要勇敢的擔當，我們要勇敢的擔當！」……歌聲撞破了暗夜的沉寂奔竄到遼闊的坡野裏去了。</p>
<p>二、踏上泥濘的路途</p>
<p>傍依着蒼松翠柏下的千佛山沉睡着的××市，很快的就消失在我們的背後了，踏在　下的，不復是平坦的馬路，而變成　　的黃泥道了，——這是北方平野上雨後幾天中所有的道路，在這道上面行進眞是吃力得很。因為鬆軟的黃泥道會使你每一步都要陷得很深，並且，當你後面一隻腳提起再向前邁進的時候，必定要相當費一點力氣，同時，鞋底下更會帶起一層厚厚的黃泥來，不可否認的事實上走這種道路是夠艱難的。然而，因為　在我們目前的希望和內心的理想太有力了，所以我們在這泥濘的道路上行進竟　是久已習慣了似的，絲毫不感到　煩和痛苦，大家望着遠方，望着跳動着銀色的晨光的遠天快慰的往前邁進！廣大的田野是我們的，我們不能讓×人渡過黃河來蹂躪它，不記得嗎，我們年年都從他的身上收取了乳漿——那小麥，　米，大荳，高粱，孕育着我們，我們成千成萬的同胞，都是靠着它的力量才得從　弱中生長起來，我們要揮動起有力的臂膀來，打擊×人，阻止他們前進，不能讓他們渡黃河……</p>
<p>（三）在黃河邊</p>
<p>我們走到黃河外堤上了，除掉我們，堤上幾乎沒有一個人影，只有幾家寫苦無告的老百姓，却依然守着夏汎被泛濫了的河水浸蝕倒半截的破茅屋，辛苦的在對他們奔來的每個日子里掙扎過去。好像是，一切慘痛的現實永遠迫困不了他們。</p>
<p>從外堤轉上內堤的時候，人們遠遠的就望見了龐大灰黑的××鐵橋，走到河邊了，我們看見了浩浩蕩蕩地奔流着的河水，那寬廣遼遠的水流，該是多麽雄渾美麗阿，望着它，我們禁不得歡呼了出來，活潑的以吾同志更大聲的，發狂似的贊頌著：</p>
<p>黃河呵，我的親娘！</p>
<p>你華夏的發源地，</p>
<p>我們祖國的心臟。</p>
<p>從我們祖宗的時代起，</p>
<p>——你就養護着我們，到如今，五千多年了，你幾曾受過暴×的污辱？更幾會受過野拘們的噬傷？但是——　在，×寇正餓狼似的撲向你，要來毀傷你了為了保衛你，我們不惜拿出自己所有的力量。拚命的　走×人，為我們華夏的祖宗爭光！</p>
<p>四、渡河</p>
<p>坐在渡河的木船上，頭覺得有點暈，這是因為急流的河水，把船震盪得太厲害了。望望水，水黃黃的，急劇的漩轉着向東流。看看天，天色蔚藍的，像是在慢慢的轉動。而兩岸黃黃澄澄的土堤，更像是在跟漩流的水，和轉動的天在追逐嬉玩，水，天，和堤岸……</p>
<p>船快到岸的時候，我們望見在像刀切的一樣整齊的，金黃色的楊樹　下，站着一個武裝同志，立刻我們就認出來了，那是姚第紅同志——一個非常正直爽快有血性的靑年。抗戰以前他還在日本念書的，蘆溝橋的砲火激憤了他，於是他離開了×國，跑囘了祖國的懷抱裏來。他加進山東致訓處工作，名義上担任着一個秘書，在工作上，他有的是熱情和剛果的毅力。</p>
<p>「歡迎！同志們：想不到你們來得這搽快，辛苦了！」姚秘書親切的對我們說，並且愉快的笑着。</p>
<p>看見了他，我們知道大隊還沒有出發，對着他那興奮的樣子，我們心中更都感覺無限的欣慰我們眞摯的囘答他道：「不累這幾十里路算不了甚麽，能够趕上大隊，已經可以抵償所有的倦乏了。」</p>
<p>五、「轟！轟！」</p>
<p>深秋季節的冷風，吹落了許多變黃了的楊樹葉子，樹葉子落在地上，給大地織成了一件美麗的披肩，人們踏在上面，它就華華沙沙的發出了音響，音響淸脆的繼續着，眞是一種情調特異的昔樂。</p>
<p>晴蔚的天空裏，忽然傳來了沉重的馬達聲，立刻，我們意識到是×機來襲了，這時候，大家沒有驚惶，只是，憤悵却充滿了胸腔。</p>
<p>「同志們！是轟炸機的聲音呢，躺下來　！靠着土坡。瞧！飛機已經在我們頭頂上了。」</p>
<p>×機的馬達狂吼着，　野豬的嘶喊，滿綴著炸彈的機翼，强烈酌震動着，發出了刺耳的聲響。為這聲響所籠罩著的地面上，暫時沉默了，只有××橋的高射砲，高射機關槍却在聯珠般的響義</p>
<p>我仰起了頸順着機聲尋覓飛機的影子，「啊」！一架！兩架！三架！……八架！九架！」內心憤恨的火熾燃着，我覺得眼珠子像是比平常時候漲大了。</p>
<p>「轟！轟……」排山倒海似的巨大的聲昔震昏了我的頭，×機殘酷的擲下炸彈來了。堤邊炸起了烟和塵土，河　激起數丈高的浪花，泡沬，兩隻負着載重汽車正在渡河的民船在浮花裏翻沉了下去……</p>
<p>「他嗎的！多麽殘酷的事情，同志們，看到沒有？那兩隻船上除掉汽車，還有我們幾十個良善的百姓呢，×機走了以後，我們拍着身上的黃土，姚秘書指着河心，痛憤的講，我們顧不得看目己身邊不遠處適才被炸出來的深坑，大家一齊望着河中心遠露着一些的桅杆頭而在搖着頭。</p>
<p>「親愛的弟兄們，安息罷！我們不會忘記你們慘痛的死，我們會給你們報仇的。」</p>
<p>姚秘書大聲的對河心說，平時常常露着笑容的長方的臉上，泛浮着哀傷和憤怒溶會成的一種極不好看的表情。</p>
<p>（六）夜行</p>
<p>近黃昏的時候，空氣特肌況　，前方的府聲　晰　盪着我們的耳膜，我和以吾　眞而又細心的辯聽着，×我炮聲每當聽到一聲砲響之後，我們就决定着說：「這沉重而緊急的×機射擊過來了。」這緩慢的是我們的炮兵　擊呢。」</p>
<p>所有的同志們，都在院子里，不顧一切的，坐在冰冰的土地上，圍成了一個大國，輕輕的談笑着猜測着姚秘書召集大家幹什麽事。</p>
<p>帶着一團和靄而又非常嚴肅的一張長的臉，姚秘書挺直的拖著他的瘦長身子，從前面院子裏走來了，當他站定之後，舉起了他那一雙不十分大的跟，卻很神氣的望望了眾人，然后，開始有力的說：</p>
<p>「同志們！我們本來打算在這兒休息一夜，可是，事育不能容我們這樣了，剛才接到情報，據說今夜×方便衣隊有來襲擊的計劃，……我們是靑年，熱誠而有力的，本來應該和他們拼一下，但是我們沒有武器，就是我有這麽一枝手槍」，他從腰間一把將他的手槍拔了出來，高舉着給我們看了一下，接著迅速的放囘了原處，「大家想，要是不顧一切的預備和×人拚的話，恐怕我們二百四十個有為的同志將要無代價的白白的犧牲了，」</p>
<p>稍稍的沉默了一會之後，他果决的接着說。</p>
<p>「同志們我們要死得重於泰山，不能死的輕於鴻毛……開展聊區城十二縣工作的重責在我們肩上，所以我們必須避免這無代價的犧牲，馬上去準備，卽別向西出發！」……</p>
<p>暮色籠罩中，我們走出了　河，沿着黃河堤疾步的向前行進，大衆都如道，說不定我們會在什么地方遇見×人的，河堤上的柳樹在光亮的上弦月下舞動着地下的樹影也在跟着搖晃，河水嗚嗚咽咽的吼叫，是一個多么懷楚而美的夜呵。</p>
<p>「放心吧。安心的向前走。」姚秘書和靄的安慰我們，「再往前面走幾里路之後就可以脫離險境了。」</p>
<p>忍受着倦乏和飢寒，我們完成了四十里的行程，在大堤上一家民房裏休息了下來，大家橫七直八就睡下了，廚房裏、牛欄裏院子裏，牛車上到處都是最香甜的眠床，在一間低矮骯髒的廚房裏，地上堆滿了木柴，我就在那見裏着軍毯躺下了，　　消度這　後半夜。</p>
<p>「睡下了嗎？」是姚秘書的　　。接着，他手裏提着一張軍蓆一步跨了進來，看見我這樣的睡法，他把我拉起來了：「明天你還往前走不走？這樣　法，木柴會把你的全身都墊疼了。拿去！」他把他手寫的草墊子遞給了我，我怎麽好意思拿呢。可是親自動手替我誧在木　上了，幷且關懷的說，「這樣舖上睡不好嗎？」</p>
<p>一謝謝你」我眞情的感激，使我不知道說什麽好了。終於，望着他那畏方可親的臉，止不住問道，「那麽你在什麽地方睡呢？」</p>
<p>「你放心，我有地方睡，好，明早見，我還要去看別的同志們。」</p>
<p>很快的，那麽長的身影，從門降轉過窗口在黑暗中消失了。</p>

<h3>本報特約通信　羅浮行（六）</h3>
<p>— 流螢</p>
<p>夜是黝黑的，每個人的心是熱列的，我們先集中團部的那棟屋子　擠滿了人，男的女的，談的笑的，陳國長很忙碌的一時跑到電話機間去，一時走囘來，不久勤務兵又走來說：「閣長：請聽電話」，他又根　碌的走出去，這樣走來走去，所以他說的話復沒有系統，到四次他走囘來舉起肥大的右手，復激昂的說：「今天下午三時，博羅城落彈七十餘，死傷平民百餘，他媽的…」。「啊！又一次大轟炸了」，朱書記長不禁奪口而出，同表們都關心這個消息，跑到電話問去打電話，一時忙了電技士，可是和長寧新作　接話後，就不能够和博羅城直接通話，因爲電力關係，只有請新作塘轉詢消息。憤怒之火充滿了這練房子。</p>
<p>開會的時間到了，我們又集中到一個廣場之中去。場是鄉民們打稻用的禾場·東西二角排着兩枝大洋油吊燈，中間一張檀子，是算作主席　，這是崔政訓主任巳經先來佈置好了的。老的少的男的女的鄉民已圍攏了來，我們到後就開會了。</p>
<p>照參加的成份來看，可以說是各界的聯歡會，不應該說是軍民聯歡會。可不是麼，陳團長，張團副，崔政訓主任和許多武裝同　在　，總司令部的林張二參謀，縣政府的科長科員們，縣黨部的書記長，各團體的代表，連海外的代表都有數位，遺有增城游擊增揮部的參觀及副官，有其他政工隊，戰工團等的人員，有鄉保甲長，加上地方民衆，這些人物，面對着光明，對着火，團團團圍攏在一個廣場上。</p>
<p>臨時推定了縣政府代表做主席，掌聲中主席宣佈了聯歡會的意義，「……是前綫，我們軍民各界在這火綫上開聯歡會，……是很有價值的，我們這裏已不分階層，性別，年齡，職業，結成了血肉的長城，……我們的歌聲，也許×人哨兵可以聽見，他常然是發抖的，……有這樣大團結。大犧牲精神，最後勝利定屬於我們……」條炸彈般的調兒從主席口中溜出，掌聲送主席說話的音波到羅浮的山陌去了。接着，陳團長，崔政訓主任，朱書記長都興奮的發表有力的演詢。各保甲長忠實的報吿，對軍隊的批評，對×人的憤恨，他們知道民主的需要，知道軍隊要打勝仗，就一定要政治敎育，要軍民合作，否則中國無希望。他們的話是樣實的，是坦白的。</p>
<p>「保衛華南，羅浮山上，青年航空員，打到×人後方……」，雄壯的論聲，一支支從會場中揚溢到田野去。特務連弟兄給催促得難以退讓了，來一個，「打」，以答覆各界，他們打國技，打　頭，一擊把頭上厚　打個　碎，他們並說：「我們就這樣打擊×人。」</p>
<p>力和火的集合，把寂靜的鄉村，喚醒了起來，到十時半這在熱的夜會才散會。</p>
<p>把力量集中到羅浮山上去</p>
<p>淸晨，羅浮山整個是靑群的，太陽澴藏在山背後，在遠遠的雲層裏。所有接近公路村莊的民衆，拖男帶女，挑着被褥，帶着牲口，向靠近羅浮這邊的公路旁，走進了羅浮的懷抱。侵略者天空中的野獸四隻三隻，不斷來洛鄉村偵察投彈，彈聲不斷在我們四週爆炸，鄉民們彷徘稚　遭到　　般奔選着，羅浮正像一隻有威力的母鷄，張開了翅膀，給稚雞以掩護。鷄稚一羣羣鑽進了龐大的母鷄懷去了。　是不願意遭殺戮，不願受××及恥爲順民的前綫同胞本能的表現。</p>
<p>我們慰勞代表團來了一個緊急會議，决定是：「分一部份人衝過火綫，去保存那些慰勞品。一部份外僑代表和婦女代表等六人由朱書記率領從原路卽刻動程囘縣城。一部份跟軍隊到羅浮山上去」。不到十分鐘的時間就完成了這個會議，並執行了議案，我感覺到最偉大的是反侵略戰爭。</p>
<p>我是跟軍隊到羅浮山上的一個，卽刻走到團部去會團長，團長正在等命令，我問他前綫情況，他很有把握的說，距離這裏五里的地方已發現×騎兵，××連××連正在截擊中，我鬥說了來意，他就很担心的說：「我鬥是决定向冲虛轉進，沿公路上去，這一路受空中威脅是很大的，你們可以向比較安全的路上山」，他說時並指一個樹林，說明那是無綫電班的集合地，他們巳指定向羅浮山之北行進，必要時可直達酥醦觀。他並催促我們快點去集合，我們看了這種情形，前線情形怎樣已明白了一半。</p>

<h3>反英宣傳變本加厲　外僑受辱不斷發生</h3>
<p>【中央社重慶十九日電】天津外訊、日方封鎖租界辦法絲亳未見鬆懈、同時日報之反英且傳、愈益變本加厲、反英傳單、到處可見、廣播電台、復不斷從事反英之宣傳、無論通衢僻巷、俱有放音器之裝置、此間食料問題、較前更形嚴重、英租界工部局總董對路透社記者稱，目下米及麵粉積貯甚多、但蔬菜肉魚之來源、業已斷絕、因日方派船在河內巡視、阻止其輸入也、至於界內英人、因先後有同胞兩名擬至英界跑馬場橫遭悔辱、故决堅留界內、緣昨有英僑一人、係男性、擬前往跑馬楊、爲日兵喝令脫下衣服、赤身裸體、聽候檢査、其所携罐頭、番被打開、另一英僑爲女性、亦橫遭巡捕侮辱、用華語加以誣蔑、該英僑略通華語、聞悉之餘、羞憤交加、幾呈「歇斯底里」之狀態、當時日本哨兵亦在場、後經若于德僑之援助、始得通過、此外有英僑唐娜萊夫人、美僑洛傑夫人因租界內室內溫度　一百零五度、熱不可耐、相率越界呼吸新鮮空氣、爾人通過木柵時、日方未加留難、但返界時、則拒不准共通過、幾經交涉、亳無結果、兩人乃步行兩哩、鐃道至另一入口處、始得通行、按此兩人、悉係僑生於中國者、又英僑史密斯、前因與華捕爭論、致爲日方捕去、雖經英總領提出交涉、迄今仍未見釋放、英商怡和太古兩公司、巳電上海總公司謂、可續運貨來津、兩公司昨有輪船十一艘、開抵天津、停泊英租界碼頭、日本巡輪未予阻撓云、</p>

<h3>新內長周鐘嶽發表　內部施政方針　整頓紀綱健全行政幹部　對於救濟禁煙奮力邁進</h3>
<p>【大陸社護慶航訊】何健調任後、國府當局、當卽委任周鍾嶽爲新任內政部長、張維翰爲政務次長、兩氏奉委後、當於十六日午後一時聯抉到部、正式視事、並召集部內職員、有所訓勉、當午周氏對新聞記者發表書面談話、對於訓練壯丁慈善救濟、勵行禁烟、均認爲當前重要之工作、而急待加强與開發者、茲附錄談話如後、</p>
<p>周氏談話</p>
<p>鄙人體弱材短、難勝重任、此次奉中樞命沗長內政、屢經懇覆、未獲俞允、惟有勉自策勵、効命國家、今日承詢政見、鄙人以爲內政部設立巳久、有法定的職掌、有歴任主管長官擘畫的方案、自當遵照法令成規、切實施行、亦別無特殊的政見、但鄙人現在應注意的幾件事、可約略一言、（一）積極推進地方政務、以適應戰時擊要、現在抗戰期間、自以軍事爲第一、然內務行政中、如關於訓練壯丁事項、慈善救濟事項、移民懇荒事項、團防保甲事項、在在皆與軍事有關、我們對於貫澈兵役運動、加强民衆組織、保銜後方治安等項、宜加緊推進、以充實抗戰力量、達到最後勝利的目的、</p>
<p>修明內政</p>
<p>（二）切實修明內政、以樹立建國基礎，我們此次抗戰、不是單純的軍事鬥爭、而是政治上爲保衛民挨國家生在獨立的戰爭、因此我們不僅是抵抗日本軍閥的侵略、同時選要完成建國的任務、但建國大業、經緯萬端、在抗戰過程中、必須從最切要最基本的部分着手、關於建國大計、已有經理的建國方略、建國大綱的遺敎、又民國二十七年三月中國國民黨臨時代表全國大會、通過之抗戰建國綱領、共中如健全民衆自衛組織、完成地方自治條件、改善各級政洽機構、整頓各級官吏紀綱等項、都是內政範圍以內應盡的責任、此外如調査戶口、整頓警察、厲行禁烟、注重衛生、無一件不是目前的要政、我們應遵奉總理遺敎、及中央制定的大綱、集中全力奮勵邁進、以奠定政治社會良好的基礎、</p>
<p>地方政治</p>
<p>（三）調整地方政治機構、以促進行政效率、抗戰建國綱領中、列有改善各級政治機構一項、而下層機構尤關重要、故特提出一談、本來地方政府、是直接治理民事的機關、同時也是最後直接受中央和省政府命令的機關、國家一切的內政法令、都待縣地方政府去執行、如果縣地方政治機構組織不完善、一切政令不能推動、那麼上層政治機關的計劃方策、便都成爲空談、自從此次抗戰發生、在地方政治上發現了許多不健全的事實、往往運用不靈、不足以應付非常時期的局面、我們最高領袖有所見於此、曾於二十七年製定「縣以下黨政機構關係草圖」、以爲初步設計的草案、又設縣政計劃委員會、對於地方政治機構之設施、詳細加以討論、又在黨政幹部訓練班、演講『確定縣以下地方組織問題』、對於黨政關係以及行收組織、皆有詳密的計劃、很可作我們改造縣政的準備、我們希望此種方案、能夠早日實施、以適應時勢的要求、並切合地方的情勢、</p>
<p>行政人員</p>
<p>（四）訓練各級行政人員、以完成訓政工作、國家一切法令、要靠地方政府的推行、巳如上所述、我們知道人類社會愈進化、則地方公共事務愈多、又當抗戰期間、地方政府所處的地位就愈重要、然而國家法令推到各縣、各縣又層遞推到鄉村、因爲鄉村人民、沒有政治上的素養、往往良善紳士畏縮不前、而公共事業在羣衆間倡導的人太少、因此歴年來地方自治的無成效、以及實行徵兵募集公債的不容易推動、其原因皆在於此、听以總理建國大綱、要實行黨政以前、必經過訓政的一階段、數年來因民衆的訓練尙未普遍、以致訓政工作亦尙未完成、現當國難嚴重之時、必須得社會上多數的優秀分子、養成實用人才、以領導民衆、發動民力、集中全國的人力、物力、財力、貢獻於國家、纔能完成抗戰建國的大業、鄙人剛才到部、於部務尙未詳悉、故只能將目前所想到的數點、來談一談、至於將來內務行政上實際情形、是要跟着國家的大政方針隨時進展、此刻是不能預定的、</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦十九日電】首相張伯淪今日在下院答覆關於天津事件之質問稱、天津事件已變爲一般政策之問題、引渡四華人之求要、現已被混雜、無復有多大重要矣、關於此事、迄未獲得日政府之正式照會、希望此事仍能就地獲得解决、</p>
<p>【路透社紐約十九日電】據泰晤士報華盛頓訪員稱、英法趨近美國、提供三國共同行動計劃、以應付日本反對在華外國租界之說、業於今日經國務部否認、唯羅斯福總統對於遠東局勢之發展、隨時加以注意云、</p>
<p>【中央社倫敦十八日電】此間接近外交部人士頃宣稱、天津市事件成立折衷方案之希望、極爲徵薄、內閣外交委員會定于明日開會、討論各種預防措置與經濟報復辦法、前者乃欲預防津市或又發生事端以致引起危險性質之衢突、關于後奢則在數日之內、倘現行爭執不能作爲地方事件成立友好解决方案、卽當循序實施下開各項措置、一、廢止一九一一年英日商務協定、二、對于日本貨物輸入英屬各殖民地者、徵收高額進口稅、三、限制日貨進口數額、四、以特種措置對付日本貨幣、並加緊援助中國法幣、迄至目前爲止、英國政府尙未要求美國予以贊助、以免有要挾美國之嫌、但預料英國若果採取强硬舉動、美國亦必參加云、</p>
<p>日本其將軟化耶？</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十九日電】「泰晤士報」令日撰文宣稱、「據最近東京來訊、日政府似在開始推求談判矣、華北日軍嘗於本月十三日發表宣言、其恫嚇之語調爲任何自尊國家听不能容忍者、然上星期六日發表之半官方宣言、已漸見和緩矣、吾人如認爲關於此事、日方已運用其外交手段、予以處理、則似屬過早矣、唯如日方確已準備以外交方法、求獲解决、實爲良好之事、杏則、英政府應採取堅决行動、以保護遠東方面之利益、此固公衆輿論所要求者也』、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十九日電】「每日電聞」報稱、「要使日本喪失「面子」、其道甚多、卽如此次日本無端實施壓迫、吾人可以施行之經濟報復、亦非僅一途而已也、但同時最要者、天津境內被包圍封鎖之居民、必不容遭受饑餓，若不能由外交途徑促使日本停止封鎖食物之運送、則英艦卽須負貴接濟、美僑與英僑同受牽涉、雅乃爾上將之赴津、或爲此事之轉機』、該報又稱、此時絕不容放棄租界、『西方列强之帝國主義、或曾迫使中國成立多少不公平之交易、然日本之帝國主義、則絕無交易可言、其目的在以刺刀之恐嚇、以掠奪中國之資源及人力』云、</p>
<p>英國一片強硬聲！</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十八日電】英海軍上將凱雅斯、今日在倫教向參加防空義勇隊大巡行者發表演說稱：一日本得穗意之聲援、發動天津事件、實際上等於對英宣戰、此種挑釁行爲、必須决心還擊」、凱雅斯上將深信英國倘能立下决心、堅持强硬態度、並向世界表明英國準備以其財富、工業、及人力、與侵略者一戰、則結果必能不動一兵而可獲致勝利、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十八日電】工黨議員格林伍達、今日在西自卽維治演說稱、「日本信必受其歐洲友人之鼓圖、業巳故意蔑視英國及其自身之國際義務、吾人亟須向獨裁主義及軍閥當政之國家表明態度、究竟在遠東或西歐、英國及其他民主國家能否縱容此種有組織的蔑視國際法基礎而欲以武力統治世界之行爲、今日世界和平巳受危害、但非德意日三國人民所願如此、而係由於該三國支配者之野心所致、此種野心必須打倒』略林伍達、並坪擊英政府之政策、認定此次造成威脅之局面、亦未始非英國政策有以致之云、</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎十九日電】今日此間各報對於遠東局勢、均加許論、「小新聞報」提出警吿謂、如目前仍引火於樂筒之旁以自娛、則遠東最後之爆裂、終難避免也、該報幷謂、英日天津事件能獲得解决、亦應加以解決、因英日恢復正常關係、固為彼此相互之基本利益也、「時代報」稱、「有效之經濟裁制必須有武力之支持、故英法司令在新加坡之會談、實具有特別重要之意義也」、著名政論家帕地納在一秩序報上撰文稱、「日本以武力奪取上海及天津之租界、固非難事、但遲早必將遭受賦洲决心反抗之影嚮、而不能抵禦英法美有力之經濟裁制也」、</p>
<p>四海之內同分擊！</p>
<p>【中央社日內瓦十九日電】自日本封鎖天津英法租界以來、歐洲各民主國報紙、卽異口同聲、一致譴責日本之橫蠻行動、幷敦促英國政府採取强硬對策、瑞士各報所取之立場、與英法等各國相同、法文日內瓦講壇報爲瑞士重要報紙之一、頃發表社評、謂、日本遭遇中國之英勇抵抗以後、乃轉攻擊白種國家矣、國聯建護各國單獨援華一舉業已生效、西方各國所支持之中國法幣、必成爲世界上最穩定之　制之一、而日元則僅有虛偽之價值而巳、日本在上海及鼓浪嶼方面俱吿失收、現又攻擊天津租界、其目的無非在妨碍英法利益、同時復盼美國採取超然態度、惟美人爲恢復遠東各國實力之平衡計、應積極比面干涉云、</p>
<p>【中央社莫斯科十九日電】蘇聯報紙對于天津局勢、持沉默態度、至昨日始發表評論謂、天津局勢、無非為日方企圖製造衝突之藉口而已、此與近頃發生之其他牽涉在華英僑之事件、幷無二致、目前遠東之緊張局勢、其原因所在、係因日本擬將英美利益逐出中國以外、幷擬奪取天津上海等地之公共租界、以及其他海港埠云、</p>

<p>從蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫最近向國會發表的演說，我們可以知道，倫敦和莫期科問仍舊有某種阻礙，不能完全打破、所以，對付軸心國家的偉大盟約，遲遲未能成立；英蘇雙方的猜疑，繼續存在着，這種猜疑是很危險的，它可以破壞整個盟約的簽訂，我們對於英蘇協定抱着非常的希望，使侵路行動成爲一種連希特勒也視爲畏途的買除工作，而避免歐洲的戰爭。</p>
<p>希特勒是一個狡猾輕傲的觀察家，他密切注視淪敦，莫斯科和波蘭的行動，如果這些國家相互間不表示信任，那末，卽使最後訂立了盟約，也嚇不了不可一世的希特勒！</p>
<p>他認爲談判時期的猜疑，可以妨碍日後的實際行動，波蘭和羅馬尼亞，據他的推測，祇能接受紅軍最小限度的援助；而且，軍事指揮不能統一，各方力量不能合作；在這種情形之下，决不能產生有效的結果，反之，在軸心國家方面，一切　源都經集中管理，可以實地迅速的突擊，來破壞敵方的同盟，所以，目前英蘇談判邊滯的危險，是很顯而易見的；這不但不能阻止敵人的侵略行動，反而能促成敵人的突擊！</p>
<p>法西斯軸心國家的同盟，是很堅强的，這不僅是防守同盟，而也是侵略者的進攻同盟，承平時期的團結，復是一致，一旦發生事變，元首的命令卽是法律，在一九三四年，蘇聯得知希特勒上台後的德國情形，遂迅速改變整個國際政策，加入國聯，成立法蘇同盟等等，英國的政策，也有了轉變，甚　於攷　興共　國家談判同臘。這實在魚一種奇蹟，這種者蹟終於降臨了。</p>
<p>英蘇談判發生許多細小的困難，主要的阻蹟，現巳去除；英法蘇三國共同承認了平等互惠的義務。莫洛托夫提出的主要困難問題是對於三波羅的海國家的保證，這種保證實是對於蘇聯的間接保護，我們相信，如果德國决心攻擊蘇聯，它必以海陸空軍同時進取波羅的海區域，毫不猶豫的破壞拉達維亞，愛沙尼亞和芬蘭的中立，這些弱小的國家沒有力量抵抗，也許，不敢加以抵抗，那末，德國不是就可利用這些國家作進攻蘇聯的根據地嗎？關於　關　題，英法巳有了　　。</p>
<p>英法提發　向曾侵購幷準備　　自衛的　　國家，施行保　，但是，波羅的　各國不戰　受保證；因爲它們恐怕觸怒希特勒；換言之，它們看到了聲　團結的軸心問盟，和充滿精疑的英蘇談判，對于那一方面是究竟强大些，發生了懷疑。如果英法蘇堅决團結一致，蹄結互助同盟，這種懷疑，就可以去除，同時，更應以共同的軍事行動來保衛波羅的海各國的中立；對於荷蘭·比利時和瑞士，也應該有此同樣待遇。</p>
<p>英法蘇同盟可以應付戰爭，當戰爭爆發的時償。但嬝，臘重要的，在和平時期。可以個得相互的援助。</p>
<p>許多人視認為予法屬斯　　者以經濟利益。可以制止其價略野心，道是大　特錯了。他們所要的是　　，不是中油！他們的目的不是人民的福利，而是爭奪靈權，壓迫他人，沉迷於『綏靖』法西斯獨　　的人們，想是忘了日本繼續在侵華，穗意毀　了捷克·破壞了西班牙，所以，我們的軍略，應該是阻止希特勒再事侵略。</p>
<p>英法蘇應立卽締結同盟，包括軍事的條欵，使侵略者無從着手，這才是制止侵略，避免歐戰的唯一正當途徑。</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>士不可以奪志</h3>
<p>中央社十八日重慶電訊，證明行刺申報瞿紹伊的兇手，係受汪派嗾使。該電還特別指出：『所謂『剷共特工指揮部』，係汪派在滬所組，經費由日方供給；最近迭向各報投函恐嚇。』</p>
<p>在精衛等之借用『剷共』之名，帶助日×殘害及恐嚇我一切主持正義愛護祖國擁護中央呼籲團結的言論界，原來毫無足奇、亦且亳不足畏，讓我們看上海導報十八日的聲明吧！他說：『一本初衷，向前邁進，非恐嚇及卑劣手段所能動搖！』聖人說：『三軍可奪其帥，匹夫不可奪志」，上海的言論界，是如何令人欽敬與感奮啊！</p>
<h3>大捕無牌小販</h3>
<p>前日下午，警探嚴密小販，結果捕去男女小販設計，大舉兜捕中區無牌八十餘人。各報登載這個淸息，描寫得淋漓盡緻，真可當作一篇小說讀—然而，不知　者看完這　新聞之後，還會默想一下否？中環街市正式市販的生意不佳，完全是這些『無牌小販』的作惡嗎？這些『無牌小販』從那裏來的，捕去了這些『無牌小販』之後，是否正式市販的生意就可興旺起來？還有，這些被補的小販，又將怎樣處置呢？</p>

<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>二次，紐約婦女聯合會舉行游藝會，里面有一個節目，是化裝卓別林比賽。事先，特電好萊塢，精這位笑匠自己來担任評判，卓氏因爲恰巧有事，囘電表示不能到會，頗爲抱憾。</p>
<p>但是，游藝會終得開，化裝比賽的節目，也得照常舉行，活說，那一天，車水馬龍，猗歟盛截。參加化裝卓別林比賽的，更是踴躍異常，小鬍子與破皮鞋一色，司的克與舊呢帽　飛。真假卓別林，簡直　分辦。</p>
<p>好容易，由三個評判左張右望的推敲，决定了前三名。在鼓掌聲中、三個當選的，上　領　了。一　大鋇杯，一個銀盾，第三名，是一們銀牌。大家正在誇獎着，第一名的鬍子漢，第二名的皮鞋　　，第三名的身段也小錯……突然間，入選第三名的　伙。在台上說起話來。</p>
<p>「　　諸位的盛意。把我選入了第三名。」說完，他把帽子，　　，那扯下來了。　　他是羅？　正是却利卓別林自己。</p>

<p>男子黃某，二十三年，隻手犯案五十七宗，不愧模竊匪中之大王。想上去此人大約有偷竊的嗜好，吃飽飯沒事做，偷着玩兒的，除此以外，尙有何種解釋呢？</p>
<p>「男子林某，有紅丸癖，某日踣跌，折斷右足，，入院施駁骨手術，醫生發覺其中紅丸毒已深，骨髓枯腐，接駁無從，乃將右足截去。』吸紅丸者，當心跌交。</p>

<p>答：昨天，偶然出了個分菓子的小問題，原定於三天後揭曉的。眞沒料到，昨天一天，收到應答的信，竟達一百八十六封，而且三分之二都是對的。這真令我有點應接不暇。想想，只有提早在今天揭曉。</p>
<p>這個問題，出的時候，就有點小手病，因此答案可以有好幾個：凡答案是：七九，一六〇·二四一·三二二·四〇三，都算對的。以後凡加八一，就可以得到這數目。</p>
<p>爲了酬謝應答者的盛意，特別和采芝齊經理商量，把獎品例外增加。前三名贈棕子六只，第四五六三名，各贈棕子三只。其餘凡答中的，都贈棕子一只，聊表謝意，並助雅興。今天采乏齋特製棕子一批，請諸位先生女士在下午二時以前，順便來領取一下。</p>

<h3>海上風雲　九</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九一四年秋，穗美航輪（凱隆柏齊號」，載着八百萬金條，到德國去，邱克斯　公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歴歐洲。在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯　加羅，和船上的德籍無線電員鮑佛。傑克在代鮑工作時，接着個怪消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來裁刦這隻船。船便無目的地在奔起來。不久，無線電中，又傳來附近有冰山的消息……</p>
<p>「我希望他聽見了，就停船。」比爾說，「我倒不是害怕，不過，開足了馬力，在這樣濃霧裏亂撞，前而又有冰山，倒底不大妥當。」</p>
<p>『我只以爲，這些乘客沒有知道是惟一的好事，他們急得夠受了，若是他們知道又有冰山，我相信，一定有人會去穿上緊身棉襖呢。一」</p>
<p>「眞的，這船上，只有美國人和英國人還有閑情浼　，今天，在吸烟室里，我看見幾個美國富翁正在計劃，預備將這船買下來，就平安過去了。』</p>
<p>「這的確是美國人的一貫作風，」傑克笑起來，「結果怎樣了呢？」</p>
<p>「船長吿訴他們，這船是非賣品，卽使他們連銀庫裏的金子價錢都付出來，還是不能賣。」</p>
<p>傑克在前面的船艙裏找到了船長，他正和一些船員，嚴重地在商議。</p>
<p>「喂，你有什麼消息了？」船長看見傑克進來。</p>
<p>「是的，不是什麼好消息，卡」利唐納方才吿訴　莉莎號，請前面有冰山。」</p>
<p>一些船員們都互換着眼光，他們都看着船長，在航行時，水面上遇見這樣絕大的危險，無疑的，都希望有命令下來。</p>
<p>他們的二副密勤，先發問了：「船長，你是不是要變更方向，或者減低速度？」</p>
<p>這個大鬍子船長對他白了一眼舉起他的大拳頭，使勁在桌子上一擊。</p>
<p>「我們照常前進！」他大聲的說；「與其讓運船落到英國人手里去，我寧可她撞得粉碎。」</p>
<p>「但是，有這麼多旅客呢！」傑克叫起來。「當眞——」</p>
<p>『雷德先生，我是這船上發號施令的，我吩咐要飛速前進。』</p>
<p>五　結下了寃仇</p>
<p>聽見傑克帶囘來的消息，比爾南諾慫聳肩說：</p>
<p>『這事我倒不驚奇，在我以前的海洋生活中，我遇見過不少德國人，他們都抱有這種信念、寧可沉掉船，不願意讓別人佔便宜。』</p>
<p>『但這是十分可怕的事呢，比　，』傑克抗議着　「隨便在什麼時候，也許就會來一個粉碎，並且——」</p>

<p>四、使日僞計劃中的華中出口統制變爲無意義現在淪陷區的出口、是黑市外匯中要供給之一、若為組織果於統制出口外匯之途（能否辦到姑且不論）、那末黑市外匯的供　勢將更滅、日方奪取外　的計劃、必將更難施行、是不營自食其果也、</p>
<p>（四）法幣强固日國荏弱</p>
<p>法幣匯率暴縮後、日圓在滬市埸價格雖亦略趨堅挺、但遠不到其應遠的標準、六月七日外匯平準基金委員會限制供　黑市外匯的前一天、日圓在上海的價格是九角二分、法幣的價格是八辦士二五、到最近法幣跌到六辨士半、日金理應　至一元一角七分、而實際上卻仍在一元之內徘徊、未能屬出平價、似頗耐人玩味、其實、這倒也並不是很難解釋的、日圓在日本國內雖因政府强力的統制、表面上仍維持着一先令二辨士的官怕、但因國家財政的困難、通貨的膨脹、準備金的枯竭、貿易的惡化、日圓對內對外用途的限制、以及對華戰事的漱趨失敗、就是愛國心很强的日本國民自己、也巳對於日圓的前途表示悲觀、這在上海公開市上所表現的日圓跌價、便是最好的證據、反之、法幣準備金却依然豐富、對內可以自由購買貨物、對外可以自由掉換外匯、日人也深信法幣的基礎、於是一等匯價稍稍有利、就併命以日圓掉取法幣、結果市場上日園供過於求、匯價自然就又落囘去、這種簡單的事實，巳由日人自己向我們說明法幣强固的基礎、還用我們懷疑嗎？　（完）</p>

<h3>掃蕩捐吻運動</h3>
<p>— 怒潮</p>
<p>日來，香港的「捐吻」空氣甚囂塵上，這運動的雖然未見諸實踐，但是，它的確引起了一部份社會人士的注意。</p>
<p>據說捐吻運動發起的目的，是爲了籌幕金錢，來貢獻祖國？而且，在某報上也居然有位女性發表了一篇自願犧牲色相的文章。作爲這運動揭幕的第一個實行者。</p>
<p>因爲言運動的方式是來得有點新鮮，所以，在客觀的立場上，通過了分析的方法，我們作應該怎祿去估價這一個新奇運卽的意義？這點，實在是值得我們商榷的。</p>
<p>因了這個捐吻運動，是爲抗戰中的祖國募集財力的補充；因此，對於這問題以及它所採取的方式，它在實踐的過程中，在客觀上將會發生一個怎樣優秀或者是惡劣效果；它對社會又具有了怎樣必然的影響，這都是我們應當予以嚴密的老慮的。</p>
<p>在祖國神聖的戰爭中，每一個的中華人民都應該將一切的人力，物力，財力，集中到抗戰的巨流里；這不獨是一個無可推却的責任，而且是一個必項負担的義務。所以我們幷不反對人民對國家的輸將；不過，我們認爲這「捐吻」的方式，是大大地污損了抗戰救國的精神的。因爲捐吻者難然是爲了祖國，然而，那些享受「吻」者的本身，他們拿錢出來的目的，第一當熱是以個女性作對象。根據這個數機故出發點，是非常錯誤的。</p>
<p>在抗戰的偉大內容里，裝進這些肉體精神上的無恥快感，對抗戰將是怎樣的侮辱。</p>
<p>假如我們明白了中國社會組織的話，我們都明顯地知道：中國是個半殖民地半封建的國家；雖然是經過了五四靑年運動和無數新思潮的冲擊，但是由於九千年來舊有社會制度，仍然根深蒂固的存在；所以，一直到目前，我們到處都容易嗅覺到封建主義殘餘意識的遺留。至於這些封建渣滓的淸除，是需要着相當的時日的。因此，對於這「捐吻」的行動，在客觀上是必然地惹起社會一般人士的誹議；而　生了相反的效果。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，只要不是漢奸，每一個中華人民都是民族的成員。在統一戰綫的意義上說：只有各階層的人物聯絡在一起，組成鐵的陣綫；也只有這樣，才能夠將敵人消滅，才能爭取最後的勝利，所以，對於這代表半封建社曾的一層，在救亡工作的技術上，我們必須極力去爭取他們的同情。避免過份盲目的行動。與他們間引起不必要的磨擦。現在，幷沒有通過社會條件的分折，以及社會基礎的把握使他們的子女和陌生的人們接吻，這花樣，當然馬上使他們反感，甚至進一步歪曲了救亡工作的基本任務，而應施以各方面的打擊。</p>
<p>所以這行動的效果，是大大的違背了抗戰的精神的，幷且，要是這運助不幸地得到了局部的畸形發展，一些不正當的娼技也會同時提出「××××」運動。我們進一步想：這將形成一個如何惡劣的影饗。</p>
<p>爲着千百第救亡工作者的革命人格，爲着民族抗戰的偉大精神，我們要掃蕩捐吻運動的氣氛。</p>
<p>對這不正確的運動，我們高舉着抗議的巨手。</p>
<h3>坑（上）</h3>
<p>— 電長</p>
<p>自搖呀　地踱下了橋，我眼珠直望在前面，只不理會右邊那個傢伙。</p>
<p>我兩隻腿行來行去，蠻自在，却又斜眼角睨着他：像燒剩了半段的黃　燭，直僵慍地挿在那裏。我禁不住好笑起來……</p>
<p>忽然，聽見皮鞋和槍柄饗，我趕緊側過身子：那七伙正好把槍眼對準我底肚皮眼。我慢吞吞地舉起了手，失去了臉上的笑容。然而，他却又放下了給背在肩上，只從腰邊摸出根短桿子，踏若正步過來。</p>
<p>從我袋裏抄出三張法幣和八張秦檜票。他慌忙把三張的挿入袴袋裏，却把秦檜票都撕碎了。他陰險地笑了一下，用手指指那邊僑脚下，我才看見那邊正掘着一個坑兒；他像一個啞吧，右手掌舉過頭頂，左手掌齊腿兒的做了一下手勢，我於是吞了口　沬走過去：那坑祗有三四尺深，一人多寬，坊旁泥堆前挿上一把小鏟子。</p>
<p>『什麼？』</p>
<p>他照前做了做手勢，又陰險地笑了一下，要我掘嗎？下面有軍火？還是有他老子的墳在下面？他接着向着我揮揮手槍，我這才對他倔强地挺挺頭頸，也這末笑呀笑的陰驗一下，過去提着這把小的鬼鏟子，試試，輕輕的——要是長些，正好劈過去，送他媽的半叚黃蠟燭歸西天；於是我把它舞弄着，他這會可怒了，緊縮着眉毛咬咬牙，把兩隻腿縮後一些，踏了踏，這表情活像燒若尾巴的老嗎猴在乾叫。</p>
<p>我裝若滿不在乎的望望前面，却空曠曠地連到個鬼都沒有，媽的，我祇好一敬遵台命」的掘了，掘呀掘的，我偷眼望望那個　伙，他拍弄着手槍，我就吮大聲乾咳一下他驀然的一跳，兩隻腿却又縮後一些，把槍眼對準了我，這樣我又掘，掘……燥得很，就在掌中吐了些沬，搓搓，掘着，剷若，等一曾，又睨他一下：也又險惡地笑呀笑的笑了，繼而悠閑地從袋裏挖出一枝香烟，燃了噴吸起來。</p>
<p>掘着，挖著，挑着泥，此剛才深了兩尺，我才歇手，又大大地乾咳了一聲。他踱了過來，拍拍我底肩，又做做手勢；還要這末深？你老子今天才晦氣！</p>
<p>我懶洋洋地舞着剷想：下面的軍火可有多少，誰留在這兒？真納悶—掘，掘，掘，察，察，我就在掘他底祖墳呢，掘呀掘的，掘，掘掘，坑旁　也堆得高高的：怪！我肩上突然給剌得痛痛地，側過頭望去：他正把手槍柄敲了我一下；我嚷：「什麼？你老子……」槍眼便對著我底咽喉，烏油油地，我才悶着聲又俛下去，掘，掘，真他媽媽的！我恨恨地吐了口　沬，搓搓手：下面眞個掘出檢來，我就用了開掉他這個乾脆！一對一，怕還幹不了？眞正羞煞人；好，掘，掘，掘。</p>
<p>我又望了過去，他正匍着拾起碎票子來，半段黃蠟燭似的身體却更智了。突然，我底心腔子幾乎跳了出來，忍不住要舉起，一個劍步跳出坑來，沒頭沒臉的給他……我正準備幹他媽的，他却站起來了，整整背着的長槍，丁當地響。</p>
<h3>所望於副刊編者的</h3>
<p>— 尚卿</p>
<p>每一個報紙，都有副刊。副刊的不可少，已可慨兒。甚至有人說，看報紙時，不看社論或某種新聞的，時常會碰到，不看副刊的，却絕無而僅有；副刊的爲人重視，尤其在這一個事實上顯了出來。還有些人，則以爲真正的與論，還當在副刊上求之，這話也許有幾分眞理在內。</p>
<p>副刊的重要如此，那末副刊的編者所負的責任重大，也就可想而知了。當然，副刊的編者在學問和道德方面，都是足以受人尊敬的，他們自然知道他們所負的責任重大，會與以適當的應付，用不着我這一個亳無編者經騐的人，來向他們饒古，但是，我想我向他們貢獻一些意見，尤其在這抗戰時期，也許可以給他們作一些參考吧。</p>
<p>第一，我希望副刊編者的意識，總是前進的，絕對不開倒車的。因此，他所選的稿子，决不會提倡一些封建思想，迷信，低級趣味，或任何國渣。文言的稿子，如果沒有特別的理由，他會不登。用了白話文還是用舊式的每句加圈，也會予以改良，　成新式標點。文中有一些說到討小老婆，嫖堂子，這些下流事，而似乎又說得津津有味，無形中加以稱許的，無論牠是什麽理由，立刻會丟到宇紙　中去，每逢選一篇稿子，都會想到：登出去會不會給讀者壞影響，阻得了社會的進步，國家的文明？</p>
<p>第二，我希望他們，鄭重其事，不敷衍，不遷就。果然是好的稿子，或至少與讀者無害的稿子，才可以登，否則卽使是有勢力的人介紹，也應該豪不含糊，予以拒絕。對於任何一篇投稿，都肯從頭至尾看一遍，切勿因爲投稿者是無名小卒，或者稿子的閉始果然不好，就此丟了，而埋沒了作者的苦心。至於將「地盤」把持住了，只用以應酬自己的二三知己，毫不公開，陌生人的稿子，不問好歹，一慨不登，那當然尤其不應該了。可登之稿，我也希望他們肯予以修飾，排好之後，肯予以校對，因爲投稿者大都在技術上不是專門的，總難免有錯誤或小妥之處，就非這樣帮一下不可。</p>
<p>第三，我希望他們不會被人利用，也不會自己作不正當的利用。登些標榜捧場的文字，還是利用的小焉者也；攻訐他人的陰私，無端誣蔑他人，如果說，並非存心要登這種文字，至少也就要負失察者之咎，如果受了別人的指使或收買，因此宜傳某種不良的主張或主義，我想賢明的編者，總一定能夠辨別得出，這是絕對不應該的吧。</p>
<p>這三點，大都還是指的平時，至於現在，抗戰健國的現在，除了以上三點，我希望副刊編者肯予以尊重以外，還要意注下面這一點：</p>
<p>只登足以振奮我們同胞的志氣的作品，絕對不登足以渙散精神的作品！因此，描寫風花雪月的文藝，我希望編者會不予以登出，就是說愁道恨，或是以暴露某種社會陰暗面的作品，我也希望以少登爲妙。明知其爲「抗戰八股」，也不能不在這「八股」中力求精進，却不能跳出這種範圍，而自鳴得意地登些與現實無關，而又不能促進我們奮鬥精神的「九股」或「七股」之類的任何大文章。當然，在孤島之上，還有「環境」這一項，也當顧慮到，而不便放言高論，以致小不忍而亂大謀。但是我想，一個聰明的編者。假使又同時一個愛國的編者，總有法，來戰勝這「環境」，以達到他的目的吧。如果事事推到「環境」身上，就此弄些不知所云，或者簡直有毒素的東西登出來，那來我要老實不客氣地說，這人是別有用心的，我們要予以嚴厲的制裁！</p>
<p>我所希望的，不過這幾點。慚愧之至，只是一些老生常談，並沒有什麽新意見。然而我要老實說，現在的各副刊編者，是否對於我們所希望的各點，經已經完全辦到了呢？當然沒有完全辦到，那末我的者望還是不能不向諸位編者一提吧。</p>
<p>總之，報紙副刊的地位是重要的，編者的責任是重大的，我希望編者肯對讀者負責，社會負責，現在更對國家民族負責，盡共抗戰建國的力量，而促進世界的文明！</p>
<h3>星火</h3>

<h3>從成都到西安</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>六、民族英雄</p>
<p>這裏，沔縣縣政府所在地的菜園子，贍也　是茅屋，但已在平原的邊沿，交通也便利，故現有××部第×××××××，有西北聯大敎職員宿舍，有一所中學。附近寫滿了抗戰標語；地雖屬陝西境，但題名團體則爲山西服務國，這裏有分站，車須略停査票。同行一女同志向我學廣東話。同行有七個女人，一爲者婦。帶着四個女孩，一個男孩。學話的女同志爲她的長女，年約廿歲。她與一位好出風頭，故示玄虛的女同志相反，爲沉思獸慮的性格者。走兩天山路，車簸動得利害，她吐嘔過幾次。我幾次的把八卦丹和齊衆水給她吃了。但出子平原，且將抵步，她心情也爽快起來了，就跟我學話。她說：</p>
<p>「我說一句廣東話你聽，看對不對？」</p>
<p>她是浙江紹興人，長大于天津，流亡過濟南，上海，蘇州，南京，武漢，到成都，現在入陜。我說：</p>
<p>「好，你說說看。」</p>
<p>戰說了，我聽不懂。她用國語翻譯出來：</p>
<p>「和我看電影去好不　？」</p>
<p>我用廣東話給她翻譯出來：</p>
<p>「同我睇電影去好唔好？』</p>
<p>她跟　學了，我囘答她說：</p>
<p>「好！」</p>
<p>大家可笑起來了。</p>
<p>「好！」</p>
<p>大家都笑起來。</p>
<p>二時半過褒城，從這裏往北走爲實鷄，往東走爲漢中（南鄭），只隔十三公里，三時車已抵南鄭城北的車站了。大家從望天卡車裏跳下來，卸下了四天成程的苦難，面容都呈現出愉快的笑容了。　（未完）</p>

<p>在集體中學習，在集體中生長　青年同樂社開幕禮　在北河戲院熱烈舉行　拉特</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>在集體中學習，在集體中生長　青年同樂社開幕禮　在北河戲院熱烈舉行</h3>
<p>— 拉特</p>
<p>整整有著一千多的靑年男女「，滿懷　與奮的熱烈的情綫，在昨天淸晴朋的上午，大家樂融　地團聚在九龍深水埔北河戲院　參加著靑年同樂社開幕典禮。</p>
<p>會場上坐滿了來賓，會　上也排坐滿了各社團的代表，更從會壇上所舉列着晨鐘社，自强社，洋務工；中華書局，　軍社，聯興打字公司，惠陽靑年會，婦女聯會宜訓班，深水埔小販平安堂，杜其章，楊岳記等所送來的撲素而美　的題有抗戰文詞的鏡架看來，都　使人聯想到靑年同樂社的本身是如何的獲得了社會人士的愛護興同情，獲得了社會所賦與它應得的地位。</p>
<p>是的，靑年同樂社曾經過了一個相當長的籌備期間，然而這一羣富有戰們熱力，富有眞理與正襲感，富有向　對祖國怒吼的氣魄的努力底下，巳經做出了許多非凡的工作，在通去他們輸送了三四十位社友囘到祖國去服務抗戰，分佈在東江，西江，北江各地，這是他們的動員工作的光榮實獻，他們又對於募捐工作，無論是精神報食，物質糧食方面，都曾經盡了他們所可能及的力量；而對戰士，傷兵，雞民發出了溫慰的炎情，他們又對於敎育工作，無論時事座　會，婦女　談會，歌詠合唱團，國語班，出版壁報及兒童團等，都非常認真的探討與敎育，這是他們對內加强敎育的一環，他們對外的服務工作，也大小不下九六十次，範圍包括戲劇歌詠等等，這些就是靑年同樂社的許多光　的成就，是博得社會人士發出同情的鳴鐘的根本來由。</p>
<p>靑年同樂社是逐步的健全長成起來。不墓負人們對它的熱切的期待了，也許它的本身還有多多少少的缺點與弱點，需要趕緊地克服。</p>
<p>九點鐘的時刻到了，歡聲柔揚的人們便興奮地望着會幕的揭開：</p>
<p>主席昂着他那活發的氣色的臉孔，宜　開會理由後，跟住便來一僑　應精神動員國民宣誓，這時人們　　着宣佈勸員高　起來了，這誓言還　了每個人的緊張血液，使人人從此更會把緊着二民　良心」的火炬來燒進着民族敗類的靈魂。宣誓後，國民黨註港代表鄭守仁先生又來訓話了，他勉勵着靑年如何的去加强團結去粉碎×人的速戰速决，遠和速决的陰謀，都是十分重要的話題：至該社名譽社長杜其　先生的　話，也同樣的鼓勵着靑年們應當提起民族自　心，在後方來堅决地淸掃漢奸的家素。打舉漢奸的言勸，以配合目　軍事　治形勢的進展，這那是一些非常寶貴的言詞，其餘還有各社團代表也簡潔而有力地對於加强民族統一陣線發出了各人應有　有的心聲，都傳得了全場熱烈的掌聲，從各人的言詞與各人的掌聲中都表示了人們思想集中，意志集中，力量集中的眞服，道不會是誇張的罷。</p>
<p>講演結束了，該社的靑年男女合唱團，他和她們都彼上了潔白的衣裳，活潑地像是一羣風浪裏的海鷗似的在劉嘉先生指揮之下唱起教亡的歌曲來，瞭喨，悲壯，淸脆，碗　的聲昔，使人感到這一軍靑年男女，愈發的可愛，大家發出了喜悅的微笑。</p>
<p>歌詠過後，人們還沒有低客剛才所享受的　樂情緒，更樂得人　領受的游藝節目又開始了：</p>
<p>第一幕「中華女兒」的獨　劇，劇情是一個富於愛　熱情的女郎寧願犧牲了甜密的愛情，而結束了她那做漢　的愛人的生命。表演相當緊張，演員的技術水準也並不壞，從人們的吼聲掌聲中分明的可以看了出來。</p>
<p>第二幕「在生死線上掙扎一也是獨專　，　情是反悲觀主義的間流，濱者的技術　也不算壞，但因爲有着多少不十分緊張的因素，所以對於入　的觀衆難免有些提不起勁的情態。</p>
<p>第三幕「我們放開恩怨」，也是獨幕劇。劇情是有一家人爲了受著×人的摧殘而袍棄了十年來對一個士兵的殺夫殺父之仇，而共同　起了軍民合作，拋奏舊恨，抵抗暴×的呼聲。這是表演得最緊張最出色，而最令人興奮鼓舞的一幕。</p>
<p>這三幕獨幕鐲，算是靑年同樂社所給予人們一些虔誠的　　　，然而正從這禮物中，便給了人們對該社所發出的活潑的熱力，所發出的嚴肅的，緊張的氣息有更深切的理解，有更眞切的信賴了。</p>
<p>劇演完後，該社一羣精乖伶俐的男女兒童們，也有着　　燕一般的音　，一中華中華……」「流浪兒童……武裝起來……」歌唱起來了。更惹得全場人們歡歡的笑聲，熱烈的鼓掌。</p>

<p>幹　要出版書刊？張先生是這樣　口訴記者：</p>
<p>「國盡像片比文字來得敏捷。深刻。尤其是廣大的僑胞與國際友人、很容易在　片上看出中　在抗戰中的苦門與新生、這些活牛生的具　事實沒有誇張、亦沒有强調、是宣慰僑胞，鼓舞僑胞擴大國際宣傳的有力的武器。</p>
<p>「目前，　內交通不便，物質條件缺乏要出版一本健全，偉大的畫報可不是一件容易的事。我們在香　　新聞工作推動文化事業，就不能不負起這個責無旁貸的偉大任務。」</p>

<h3>本港漁船遭×艦肆　統計損失達二千萬　漁船被燴逾千遭害者萬餘人　三門關無和漁民竟被附×</h3>
<p>自前年九月、×艦非法封鎖我海岸後、本港漁船在港海外被×艦××××之事件、幾無日　之、最初雖曾有一份漁船接納政府勸吿、暫停出海、然而歷時旣久、生活實成問題遂又復冒險駕船出海作業、置生死于度外、若遇×艦則設法逃避、旣被捕獲、則塌力抵抗、大部皆作壯烈　牲、造成船民遭害之空前紀錄、</p>
<p>漁民遇害　最近統計</p>
<p>港中漁民每次出海遭難後、其逃生者卽向僑港漁民協會報吿、漁會在過去一年餘彙集各方報吿、經將漁民遭難實情、呈報祖國政府當局、據該會最近發表統計報吿、由前年九月至去年十一月底止、本港漁船在港海外被×艦焚燬者共六百二十八艘、漁民遇害一萬零九十二人、由本年一月至五月底止五個月內、漁船被焚燬者十六艘、失蹝者三十四艘、平均計算漁民遇害一千二百〇五人、由前年九月至本年五月底止、計在廿一個月內、被焚燬之漁船共六百四十四艘、失踪者三十四艘、漁民遇害統計一萬一千三百四十二人、上述數目僅係根據漁民報吿加以統計、其他未有到會報吿者尙未列入、估計本港漁船被焚燬及失蹤者廿一個月來總在一千艘以上、約計漁民船隻金錢損失其數目達二千萬元之巨</p>
<p>×艦肆　　三個時期</p>
<p>根據報告艦對漁民摧殘大致可分為三個時期、最初威嚇、每遇漁給在海外作業、卽施以　燬、第二時期則施行懷柔政策、利誘漁民、最近則施行據刦政策、　因此最近五個月來、本港漁船失蹤特多、失　者人船均被擄去、祇由其同　　海者返港報吿、×兵除××財物外、漁民子女尤為此輩之目的物、查每一漁拖、平均約有兒童六七人之多、×兵將之擄去後、趕返×國、施以奴化敎育、藉以補充其國內壯丁、此種手段、至為狠毒、</p>
<p>無和漁民　被誘附×</p>
<p>尤足痛心者、則為無知漁民、竟有被誘附×者、刻下三門關附近、已有一部份漁民被×收買、據從三門關返港之漁民報吿、該處現有若干漁民為×利誘、竟作漢奸、結成集團、代×運輸粮食、復受×艦保護、在沿海一帶捕魚、而本港漁船駛至該處、則被×艦××、過去×艦在港海各處　去之漁船亦多、停泊於該處、漁民協會據報後、為防止無知漁民被×吸引附×起見、經積極向漁民勸吿、出海捕漁應審愼注意、勿駛近三門關附近、免遭不幸、而多數漁民亦鑑於在該處捕魚過於危險、未敢駛往該處、改在陸豐甲子碣石平海澳頭等處捕魚、以避免×艦擄刦、</p>
<p>當局改善　漁民生活</p>
<p>至漁民附×之原因、則由于生活困難、被×利誘所致、國內軍政當局、有鑑及此、特進行改善漁民生活、最近第×戰區司令都為調查廣東沿海居民生活狀况、進行改善起見、特組織廣東東海區漁　視察團、派赴沿海各地視察、該　最近已抵港、轉赴寳安、在港期間曾向僑港漁民協會調查一切、由該會提供關于漁民生活狀况之參玫資料甚多、並將主管漁鹽機關公務人員向漁民敲詐各種情形、詳細報吿、請求當局澈底改善、　得解决漁民生活、並由漁會具備呈文、書面向當局呈報、俾得設法改善云、</p>

<h3>Tianjin Incident and the Far East</h3>
<p>The so-called concession issues, from Shanghai and Gulangyu to the Tianjin Incident, were originally initiated by Japanese militarists to break through the setbacks in their military aggression against China. However, unexpectedly, they faced setbacks in Gulangyu, and now in Tianjin, they have become "forceful." The reason here is very simple and clear: In the case of Gulangyu, the British attitude was not only strong but also maintained close contact and joint action with the United States and France, such as jointly dispatching marines to land. However, in Tianjin, the United Kingdom did not have close contact with the United States and France, and the British attitude itself was very weak. At first, Britain agreed to extradite anti-Japanese elements, then only hoped that the United States would come forward to mediate. In the end, they hesitated and only considered what retaliatory measures to take, always "a lot of thunder and little rain."</p>
<p>The extradition of Chinese anti-Japanese elements has already encountered a tough stance from Japan. Japan is not satisfied with this extradition; what Japan demands is a so-called "fundamental change" in the British Far East policy. The hope for U.S. mediation also vanished due to Japan's refusal. Hesitant retaliatory measures encountered even more severe threats from Japan: "If the British government takes swift and active steps to protect its interests in China, Japan will be forced to take all necessary measures to deal with the new situation" (official Japanese statement). So, how will the matter unfold from now on? What steps should Britain take?</p>
<p>The Tianjin Incident is no longer just a local issue in Tianjin, nor is it just an issue between Britain and Japan. In essence, it is an issue between all third countries and Japan, the entire issue of the Far East, and also a confrontation between the aggressive group and the anti-aggression group. Therefore, to deal with this serious issue, Britain must pay attention to this major premise. Britain does not need to fear Japan's threats. What Britain urgently needs now is to quickly adjust the pace of the anti-aggression group, especially to effectively unite with countries that have close ties with the Far East. The consultation between the military leaders of Britain and France stationed in the Far East on cooperation methods is certainly important, but this consultation cannot be without the United States. The United States is the country that Japan fears the most. For Britain to impose economic sanctions on Japan, it needs the cooperation of the United States; otherwise, the effect will not be significant.</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviet Union occupies an important position in the Far East relations. Its powerful strength is crucial to the situation in the Far East. The Japanese militarists, who are bogged down in military operations against China and want to shift their focus to third countries, are still only making empty noises towards the Soviet Union, while they are acting recklessly and brutally towards Britain. Japan's recklessness towards Britain is partly to restrain Britain from getting close to the Soviet Union, but it also shows its fear of British-Soviet cooperation. To enhance Britain's position, British-Soviet negotiations should not be delayed, so that aggressors can see the shortcomings of disunity in the anti-aggression group.</p>
<p>Britain has no reason to fear Japan. Although the Japanese government supports the militarists' reckless policy with united opposition, its internal fundamental contradictions will increase further due to the difficulties of military aggression against China. If Britain can increase the difficulties of Japan's aggression against China, the foundation of its Far East policy can be consolidated.</p>
<h3>Northwestern Shandong Correspondence: A Record of Crossing the Yellow River</h3>
<p>1.  Departure</p>
<p>Starlight flickers in the deep night sky, its bright edges clean, beautiful, and sharp. On the earth, all is quiet, without a sound. Only the cool autumn wind gently blows against our thin military uniforms. It should be a bit cold, but who among us is so delicate? We are strong, our chests filled with the hot blood of anger and revenge. What is a little cold wind?</p>
<p>Following the winding road outside the city walls, we marched forward with vigorous steps, seemingly forgetting the heavy bags on our shoulders. We cleared our throats and sang aloud:</p>
<p>"The motherland is on the line of death, our compatriots are starving and wandering, the five-thousand-year-old nation must rise, the four hundred and fifty million people must be liberated! Two heavy tasks fall on our shoulders, sisters and brothers across the country, we must bravely undertake them, we must bravely undertake them!"... The song shattered the silence of the dark night and rushed into the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>2.  Stepping onto the Muddy Road</p>
<p>The slumbering city of ××, nestled against the verdant Thousand Buddha Mountain with its ancient pines and cypresses, quickly disappeared behind us. Beneath our feet, it was no longer a flat road, but a muddy yellow path. This is what all roads in the northern plains become after a few days of rain. Traveling on this road is truly exhausting. Because the soft yellow mud will make you sink deep with every step, and when you lift your back foot to move forward, you will have to exert considerable effort. At the same time, a thick layer of yellow mud will stick to the bottom of your shoes. It is undeniable that walking on such a road is difficult enough. However, because the hopes we hold and the ideals in our hearts are so powerful, we seem to be used to marching on this muddy road, without feeling annoyed or painful at all. Everyone looks into the distance, at the distant sky where the silver light of dawn dances, and strides forward with joy! The vast fields are ours, and we cannot let the × people cross the Yellow River to trample them. Don't forget, we have been taking nourishment from it every year – wheat, millet, soybeans, sorghum – nurturing us, and tens of thousands of our compatriots have been able to grow from weakness because of its strength. We must wave our powerful arms to strike the × people and stop them from advancing; we cannot let them cross the Yellow River...</p>
<p>(3) On the Bank of the Yellow River</p>
<p>We walked onto the outer embankment of the Yellow River. Apart from us, there was hardly a soul on the embankment, only a few families of helpless old people who were still guarding their broken thatched huts, half-submerged by the flooded river during the summer, struggling painfully to get through each day. It seemed that all the tragic realities could never trap them.</p>
<p>Turning from the outer embankment onto the inner embankment, people could see the huge, gray-black ×× Iron Bridge in the distance. When we reached the riverbank, we saw the mighty, surging river. How magnificent and beautiful that wide and distant flow of water was! Looking at it, we couldn't help but cheer. Comrade Yi Wu even louder, praised madly:</p>
<p>Yellow River, my dear mother!</p>
<p>You are the birthplace of China,</p>
<p>The heart of our motherland.</p>
<p>Since the time of our ancestors,</p>
<p>– You have nurtured us. Now, for more than five thousand years, when have you ever been humiliated by violence? When have you been harmed by the barbarians? But – now, the × bandits are pouncing on you like hungry wolves, wanting to destroy you. To protect you, we will spare no effort and desperately drive away the × people to bring honor to our Chinese ancestors!</p>
<p>4.  Crossing the River</p>
<p>Sitting on the wooden boat crossing the river, I felt a little dizzy, because the rapid current was shaking the boat too violently. Looking at the water, it was yellow, swirling rapidly and flowing east. Looking at the sky, it was azure blue, as if slowly turning. And the yellow and clear earthen embankments on both sides seemed to be chasing and playing with the swirling water and the rotating sky. Water, sky, and embankment...</p>
<p>When the boat was about to reach the shore, we saw an armed comrade standing under the neatly cut golden poplar trees. We immediately recognized him. It was Comrade Yao Dihong – a very upright, straightforward, and spirited young man. Before the war of resistance, he was studying in Japan. The cannons of Lugou Bridge enraged him, so he left × country and ran back into the arms of his motherland. He joined the Shandong Zhixun Office, nominally serving as a secretary, and he had enthusiasm and perseverance in his work.</p>
<p>"Welcome, comrades! I didn't expect you to come so quickly, you must be tired!" Secretary Yao said to us kindly and smiled happily.</p>
<p>Seeing him, we knew that the main force had not yet set off. Seeing his excited appearance, we all felt infinite joy in our hearts. We sincerely replied to him, "We're not tired. These dozens of miles are nothing. Being able to catch up with the main force is enough to compensate for all the fatigue."</p>
<p>5.  "Boom! Boom!"</p>
<p>The cold wind of late autumn blew down many yellowed poplar leaves. The leaves fell on the ground, weaving a beautiful shawl for the earth. When people stepped on them, they made a rustling sound, a kind of unique and pleasant melody.</p>
<p>In the clear blue sky, a heavy sound of motors suddenly came. Immediately, we realized that × planes were coming to attack. At this time, everyone was not panicked, but anger filled their chests.</p>
<p>"Comrades! It's the sound of bombers! Lie down! Lean against the embankment. Look! The planes are already over our heads."</p>
<p>The motors of the × planes roared like the screams of wild boars. The wings, laden with bombs, vibrated violently, making a piercing sound. The ground, enveloped by this sound, was temporarily silent. Only the anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns of the ×× Bridge were firing like a string of pearls.</p>
<p>I craned my neck and searched for the shadow of the planes following the sound. "Ah! One! Two! Three!... Eight! Nine!" The fire of inner hatred burned fiercely. I felt that my eyeballs were larger than usual.</p>
<p>"Boom! Boom..." A huge, earth-shattering sound deafened my head. The × planes cruelly dropped bombs. Smoke and dust erupted on the embankment, and waves and foam rose several feet high in the river. Two civilian boats, loaded with trucks and crossing the river, capsized in the floating debris...</p>
<p>"Damn it! What a cruel thing. Comrades, did you see that? Those two boats, in addition to the trucks, had dozens of our good people on board. After the × planes left, we patted the yellow dirt off our bodies. Secretary Yao pointed to the center of the river and said painfully and angrily. We didn't bother to look at the deep pit that had just been blasted out not far from us. Everyone looked at the center of the river, where some masts were barely visible, and shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Dear brothers, rest in peace! We will not forget your tragic deaths. We will avenge you."</p>
<p>Secretary Yao said loudly to the center of the river. On his long, rectangular face, which usually wore a smile, floated a kind of unpleasant expression made up of sorrow and anger.</p>
<p>(6) Night March</p>
<p>Near dusk, the air was especially crisp. The sounds from the front clearly reverberated in our eardrums. Yi Wu and I carefully listened and distinguished them. "The heavy and urgent sound is the artillery fire from the × planes." "The slow one is our artillery fire."</p>
<p>All the comrades were in the courtyard, disregarding everything, sitting on the icy ground, forming a large circle, lightly chatting and guessing what Secretary Yao had called everyone together for.</p>
<p>Wearing a long face that was both amiable and very serious, Secretary Yao straightened his slender body and walked from the front courtyard. When he stood still, he raised his pair of not very large hands, looked at everyone very spiritedly, and then began to speak forcefully:</p>
<p>"Comrades! We originally planned to rest here for the night, but things will not allow us to do so. We just received intelligence that the × people's plainclothes team has a plan to attack tonight... We are young, enthusiastic, and powerful, and we should have fought them, but we don't have any weapons, except for this pistol I have." He pulled his pistol out from his waist, raised it for us to see, and then quickly put it back in place. "Everyone thinks, if we prepared to fight the × people regardless of everything, I'm afraid our two hundred and forty promising comrades will sacrifice in vain without any value."</p>
<p>After a brief silence, he decisively continued.</p>
<p>"Comrades, we must die heavier than Mount Tai, not lighter than a feather... The heavy responsibility of developing the twelve counties in the Liberation Area is on our shoulders, so we must avoid this worthless sacrifice. Prepare immediately and set off westward!"...</p>
<p>In the gathering dusk, we walked out of the river and marched forward along the Yellow River embankment. Everyone knew that we might encounter the × people somewhere. The willow trees on the river embankment danced under the bright crescent moon, and the shadows of the trees on the ground also swayed. The river roared mournfully and beautifully.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. Walk forward with peace of mind." Secretary Yao comforted us amiably, "We can get out of danger after walking a few more miles ahead."</p>
<p>Enduring fatigue and hunger, we completed a journey of forty miles and rested in a civilian house on the embankment. Everyone fell asleep haphazardly. The kitchen, the cowshed, the courtyard, and the oxcart were all the sweetest beds. In a low and dirty kitchen, the ground was piled with firewood. I lay down on my military blanket in that kitchen and spent the rest of the night.</p>
<p>"Are you asleep?" It was Secretary Yao's voice. Then, he stepped in with a military mat in his hand. Seeing how I was sleeping, he pulled me up: "Are you still going to walk forward tomorrow? Sleeping like this, the firewood will make your whole body ache. Take this!" He handed me the straw mat he had written on. How could I be so embarrassed to take it? But he personally put it on the firewood for me and said with concern, "Isn't it good to sleep with this?"</p>
<p>"Thank you," I sincerely thanked him, so I didn't know what to say. Finally, looking at his kind and approachable face, I couldn't help but ask, "Then where do you sleep?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I have a place to sleep. Okay, see you tomorrow. I have to go see the other comrades."</p>
<p>Soon, that long figure turned from the doorway and disappeared into the darkness through the window.</p>

<h3>Our Fresh Troops Cross the River to Reinforce, Jin × Suffers Nearly 10,000 Casualties, Offensive Exhausted, We Adopt Mobile Tactics, Achieving Repeated Victories</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Chongqing correspondent on the 19th] × adopts a defensive posture on all fronts. The major battle in southern Shanxi, with the foothills of Zhongtiao Mountain as the battlefield, continues to unfold. × launched its first offensive and fought bitterly for more than ten days, but its offensive has been exhausted, and it has suffered nearly 10,000 casualties. It is currently awaiting respite. We are adopting mobile tactics, making vertical and horizontal assaults, and coordinating with folk forces such as the Red Spear Society, strictly implementing a scorched-earth policy. Fresh troops continue to cross the river. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented major victory in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, and the defense of Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei will be absolutely consolidated.</p>
<p>Glorious Battle Records of Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] In the recent battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, × has suffered unusually heavy casualties and is now retreating towards Fengxian, Wenxi, and Yuncheng. We are in pursuit. In total, in this battle, × attacked us with three times our forces and a large number of poison gas shells, fighting for ten days and nights. We suffered more than 3,000 casualties, while × suffered many times more. In this unprecedented bloody battle, there are indeed many glorious stories that are worth singing and crying about. For example, in the battle of Maojinbei, Company Commander Yang Shiwu and his entire company, in the battle of Pinglu, Regiment Commander Zheng Peiyuan and all his soldiers, all died for their country. Battalion Commander Fan Wenyin also died heroically in the battle of Guwang. All are worthy of respect and chill the hearts of ×.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 18th] On the night of the 15th, our troops attacked Zhangdian East and West, × could not resist and fled westward. We immediately recovered the area and continued to pursue, occupying the line of Guwangdongyan by noon on the 16th. We are still continuing to advance westward. The majority of × is fleeing westward. In recent days, × casualties have reached six or seven thousand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] In recent days, the fighting between our × and × has been very fierce in the villages southeast of Zhangdian. Yandi Village and Guocun Village have been recovered by our troops. On the 14th and 15th, we killed more than a thousand ×. The majority of × in the area are now fleeing north, and they are engaged in fierce fighting with us in the area of Hetaotu and Yuejiazhuang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] On the morning of the 15th, the × in Fencheng, together with more than a thousand × from Xiwang Village and other places, attacked the Yanshan area with four cannons attached. Our army set up an ambush in the critical area. From 8:00 a.m., fierce battles broke out between our × and × in Sanguanhuo, Bugu, and other places. Around 3:00 p.m., × gradually moved back. After a fierce attack by our troops, the × formation was thrown into chaos and fled in a panic. In this battle, hundreds of × were killed, and we suffered more than ten casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 19th] After our troops occupied the line of Dachen Village and Pinglu on the 17th, the remaining × fled in disarray towards Zhangdian Town and Houwang, in a very miserable state. They indiscriminately burned and killed along the way. We comforted and appeased the people on the one hand, and actively advanced south of Zhangdian on the other.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 19th] The × in southern Shanxi have been frequently mobilized recently. Up to the evening of the 17th, it was heard that Wenxi had increased × by more than 4,000, and Ji County had increased × by more than 3,000. Cars of × bandits were constantly traveling back and forth between Wenxi and Hedi (east of Wenxi). The × in Xia County are constantly attacking Chuanjia Xie Wende Village (east of Xia County) and other places, attempting to enter the mountains in separate routes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 18th] The war situation in northern Henan is quite calm. On the night of the 6th, our troops, under the cover of artillery fire, once attacked the × army in Xixiang (about 20 kilometers northwest of Qinyang). Because it was late at night, × was unprepared. One of their ammunition depots was destroyed by us, and many × were killed. On the 16th and 17th, hundreds of × infantry and cavalry, with several tanks attached, were reported to be coming to aid. We briefly contacted them, and because our mission had been accomplished, we safely returned to our defense.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers and Corpses Cremated, Transported to Japan in Large Quantities</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] According to military information, the statistics of × transporting wounded soldiers and cremated corpses back to Tianjin and Guandong in late May are as follows: (1) More than 2,400 wounded soldiers and eight cars of cremated corpses, plus 2,000 bags, totaling about 10,000 people, were transported from various counties along the Pinghan and Pingsui lines and southern Shanxi to Tianjin. (2) 1,050 × wounded soldiers and 400 bags of cremated corpses were transported from Shijiazhuang to Tianjin. (3) 100 bags of cremated corpses were transported from Tangguanshan to Tianjin. (4) 538 bags of × soldiers' ashes, totaling 1,614 people, and more than 450 wounded soldiers were transported from Beiping to Tanggu. (5) 338 bags of × soldiers' cremated corpses, totaling 714 people, were transported from Tongzhou to Tanggu. (6) 15 bags of cremated corpses of senior officers, totaling 190 people, 420 bags of lower-level officers, totaling 420 people, and 500 bags of soldiers, totaling 500 people, were transported from the Jinpu line to Tanggu. (7) More than 400 wounded soldiers were transported from Jinan to Tanggu. (8) Corpses cremated officers and soldiers were shipped in 52 bags and 41 bags respectively from Jinan to Guandong. (9) More than 300 × wounded soldiers were transported from the Pingsui line to Dalian. In total, more than 4,600 × wounded soldiers and 14,110 cremated corpses were transported back from various places in ten days. It can be seen that the × army suffered a large number of casualties.</p>
<p>The Situation South of the Yangtze River is Stable</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 18th] On the evening of the 17th, our troops attacked the × west of Beigang, Tongcheng, first using a small number of troops to lure × out and then ambushing the main force at various key points. When × approached, we concentrated our firepower and launched a surprise attack on ×, killing more than a hundred and capturing one light machine gun, eight rifles, one telephone, five helmets, and many diaries and documents. The remaining × fled back to Beigang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yingde, 19th] On the morning of the 16th, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry fled from Longkou to the vicinity of Shibaling (southwest of Huaxian). After being ambushed by our troops on the left and right, many were wounded and killed. By noon, × had increased to more than 500, and the fighting between the two sides was fierce. Our troops sent out surprise soldiers to cut off the rear of ×. All of × were surrounded by us and are currently being attacked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 19th] The × in Jiangmen and Xinhui harassed Guzhen, Zhongshan, on the 15th and 16th and were repelled by us. They turned to rob grain from villages near Sanjiang and were severely attacked by our local forces, retreating back to Beijie. On the 17th, they sent patrol boats to the vicinity of Sanjiang and shot indiscriminately before fleeing.</p>
<h3>Han × Gasoline is Burned, Anti-War Elements Set Fire</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shashi, 19th] A large batch of gasoline, a total of more than 8,000 boxes, was transported to the Jianghanguan Wharf in Hankou by ×. × soldiers guarded it day and night, very strictly. On the afternoon of the 16th, a sudden fire completely destroyed it. After the × Military Police investigated, it was said that the fire was caused by anti-war elements.</p>
<h3>Traitors in Yueyang Executed by ×</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 19th] Cao Zhuru, the head of the puppet maintenance association in Yueyang, and Zhou Mianzhi, the deputy head, acted as accomplices and poisoned the residents. A few days ago, × ordered them to collect strong men within ten days for × to drive. Because the traitors failed to collect and report on time, and because the traitors failed to collect enough gold and silver for × military use, they failed to satisfy × desires, which angered ×. They were shot in the suburbs a few days ago. The fate of the traitors can be a warning.</p>
<h3>Compatriots in Occupied Areas Believe in Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 19th] The Jiaozuo × army recently searched households in the city, strictly confiscating any legal currency they found and arresting and punishing the people. However, our compatriots have a strong belief in the legal currency, which they still secretly use. The price is also rising, but no one cares about counterfeit money.</p>

<h3>National Government Order</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 The National Government, on the 19th, issued an order stating that Mr. P. T. Powell, a hydraulic engineering expert from the International League, has been serving in our country for eight years. He has diligently and remarkably assisted in the planning of various hydraulic projects. This time, while surveying water conservancy in the Jinsha River with Zhang Jiong, a technician from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Hu Yunzhou, a member of the Southwest Transportation Administration, they encountered numerous dangers during the trial voyage, but they did not retreat in the slightest. Unfortunately, the boat capsized, resulting in their demise. We deeply mourn their past contributions and feel profound regret. Zhang Jiong and Hu Yunzhou were both courageous in their duties and died in the line of duty, which is commendable. An order should be issued to commend them, and Mr. P. T. Powell should be given a consolation payment of 10,000 yuan, and Zhang Jiong and Hu Yunzhou should each receive 5,000 yuan, to encourage others. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Special Correspondence from Our Newspaper: Travels in Luofu (6)</h3>
<p>— Firefly</p>
<p>The night was dark, but everyone's heart was burning with fervor. We first gathered in the building that housed the regiment headquarters, which was packed with people, men and women, talking and laughing. Regiment Commander Chen was very busy, running to the telephone room at one moment and returning the next. Soon, the orderly came again and said, "Commander, please answer the phone." He then ran out again, walking back and forth. Thus, his words were disorganized. The fourth time he returned, he raised his large right hand and said with fervor, "This afternoon at 3 o'clock, over seventy bombs fell on Boluo City, killing and wounding over a hundred civilians, damn it!" "Ah! Another big bombing!" Secretary Zhu exclaimed involuntarily. Colleagues were all concerned about this news, running to the telephone to make calls, making the technicians busy for a while. However, after connecting with Xinzhu Tang, they could not directly communicate with Boluo City due to power issues. They had to ask Xinzhu Tang to inquire about the news. Anger filled this practice room.</p>
<p>The meeting time arrived, and we gathered in a square again. The square was a threshing ground used by the villagers. Two large kerosene lamps were arranged at the east and west corners. A sandalwood chair in the middle was considered the chairman's seat. This was already prepared by Director Cui Zhengxun. Old and young, men and women, villagers had gathered around. The meeting began after we arrived.</p>
<p>Judging from the participants, it could be said to be a carnival for all walks of life, rather than a military-civilian gathering. Wasn't it so? Regiment Commander Chen, Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang, Director Cui Zhengxun, and many armed colleagues were present, along with Staff Officers Lin and Zhang from the General Headquarters, section chiefs and staff from the county government, the secretary of the county party headquarters, representatives from various organizations, and even several representatives from overseas. There were also observers and adjutants from the Zengcheng Guerrilla Headquarters, personnel from other political work teams and combat engineering corps, as well as village chiefs and heads of the baojia system, plus local people. These people, facing the light, facing the fire, were all gathered together in a square.</p>
<p>A representative from the county government was temporarily elected as chairman. Amidst applause, the chairman announced the significance of the gathering. "…At the front line, it is very valuable for our military and civilians from all walks of life to hold a carnival on this line of fire… Here, we no longer distinguish between class, gender, age, or occupation. We have formed a great wall of flesh and blood… Our singing, perhaps, the enemy sentries can hear it, and they will naturally tremble… With such great unity and great spirit of sacrifice, final victory will surely belong to us…" These bomb-like words slipped out of the chairman's mouth, and the applause sent the sound waves of the chairman's speech to the mountain ridges of Luofu. Following that, Regiment Commander Chen, Director Cui Zhengxun, and Secretary Zhu all excitedly delivered powerful speeches. The heads of the baojia system faithfully reported, criticized the army, and expressed their hatred for the enemy. They knew the need for democracy and that the army must win battles. They emphasized the importance of political education and military-civilian cooperation, otherwise, China would have no hope. Their words were realistic and frank.</p>
<p>"Defend South China, on Mount Luofu, young aviators, strike the enemy's rear…" Vigorous discussions echoed from the meeting place to the fields. The brothers of the Special Service Company were urged to the point of being unable to refuse and performed the "hit" to respond to all sectors. They practiced their martial arts, hitting the heads, smashing a thick stack of tiles on their heads with one blow. They also said, "This is how we strike the enemy."</p>
<p>The gathering of strength and fire awakened the quiet countryside, and the lively night meeting ended at half past ten.</p>
<p>Concentrate Strength on Mount Luofu</p>
<p>In the early morning, Mount Luofu was entirely verdant. The sun was still hidden behind the mountain, in the distant clouds. All the people near the villages along the highway, dragging their children and carrying their bedding and livestock, walked towards the highway near Luofu and into the embrace of Luofu. Four or three beasts in the sky belonging to the invaders constantly came to the villages to scout and drop bombs. The sound of bombs constantly exploded around us. The villagers wandered around like chicks encountering a hawk, running around. Luofu was like a powerful hen, spreading its wings to protect the chicks. Groups of chicks burrowed into the vast hen's embrace. This was the instinctive expression of the front-line compatriots who were unwilling to be slaughtered, unwilling to be abused, and unwilling to become obedient subjects.</p>
<p>Our comfort delegation held an emergency meeting and decided that "part of the people would rush through the line of fire to save those comfort goods. A part of the foreign representatives and women representatives, a total of six people, led by Secretary Zhu, would immediately start the journey back to the county seat via the original route. A part of the people would follow the army to Mount Luofu." This meeting was completed in less than ten minutes, and the agenda was implemented. I felt that the greatest thing was the anti-aggression war.</p>
<p>I was one of those who followed the army to Mount Luofu. I immediately went to the regimental headquarters to meet the regimental commander. The regimental commander was waiting for orders. I asked him about the front-line situation. He said with confidence that enemy cavalry had been discovered five miles away from here, and Company XX and Company XX were intercepting them. I explained my purpose, and he said with concern, "We have decided to advance to Chongxu along the highway. This route is greatly threatened by the air. You can go up the mountain on a safer road." As he spoke, he pointed to a grove of trees and explained that it was the gathering place for the radio squad. They had been designated to proceed north to Mount Luofu and could directly reach Suzao Temple if necessary. He urged us to gather quickly. After seeing this situation, we understood half of what the front-line situation was like.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Suggest the Government Sever Diplomatic Relations with Japan, Strike at Japan's Ambitions to Seize Concessions, Uphold Justice, and Protect American Interests</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 According to TASS, New York, 19th, "The Herald Tribune" editorial proposes that if Japan continues to blockade the Tianjin and Gulangyu concessions, the United States should immediately sever diplomatic and commercial relations with it. The newspaper strongly argues that regardless of the attitudes of Britain and France, the United States must make a firm statement to Japan that the United States is unwilling to maintain friendly diplomatic and commercial relations with countries that launch wars of aggression and infringe upon their rights.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Shanghai, 19th】 The "China Press," an English-language newspaper run by Americans here, published an article tonight commenting on the situation in Tianjin, urging the U.S. government to take the same stand as Britain and France, and warning that if the United States believes that it has no territorial interests in Tianjin and does not cooperate with Britain and France, it will only encourage Japan to take the same actions in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Minister Blatantly Declares Not Afraid of Anglo-French Cooperation, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Visits Japanese Foreign Ministry, Talks on Reopening Gulangyu Negotiations</h3>
<p>Tianjin Situation Deteriorates</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 Tokyo News: Naval Minister Yonai has been inspecting various provinces recently, and has now returned here yesterday after completing his duties. He also made a statement, saying that there are rumors outside that the British and French navies are considering taking joint action. If these rumors are true, Japan has nothing to fear. Regarding the Tianjin incident, Yonai said that the Tokyo government is determined to fully support the position of the Japanese authorities in Tianjin so that the matter can be resolved locally. Regarding the Gulangyu incident, the government's policy has not changed, and it deeply hopes that Consul General Okada will be able to return to his post in Xiamen so that the matter can be resolved effectively. Regarding the opening of China's inland rivers, the government has decided on a basic policy, but this matter must not be handled carelessly.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Tokyo, 19th】 According to a declaration issued by the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, the blockade of Tianjin is entirely directed against the British concession because the British concession serves as "an organization of the Kuomintang." The British side has stated that the Japanese demands affect countries that have treaty relations with China, intending to "lure the United States to pull chestnuts out of the fire." However, the blockade is not aimed at any other country, let alone against the United States. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Japan visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, meeting with Yoshizawa, the Director of the American Affairs Bureau, to exchange views on the situation in Tianjin. According to Domei News Agency, the Japanese Consul General in Xiamen returned to his post from Tokyo yesterday, and it is expected that he will reopen negotiations with the foreign consular authorities on the situation in Gulangyu. The Japanese government will continue to support the attitude of the Japanese authorities in the area. Furthermore, according to the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, the barbed wire surrounding the British concession will be electrified starting tonight.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Propaganda Intensifies, Insults Against Foreigners Continue to Occur</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 Tianjin Foreign News: The Japanese method of blockading the concession has not been relaxed in the slightest. At the same time, the anti-British propaganda in Japanese newspapers is becoming increasingly intensified. Anti-British leaflets are everywhere, and radio stations are constantly engaged in anti-British propaganda. Loudspeakers are installed everywhere, whether in thoroughfares or remote alleys. The food problem here is more serious than before. The Chairman of the British Concession's Municipal Council told a Reuters reporter that there are currently many rice and flour reserves, but the source of vegetables, meat, and fish has been cut off because Japanese ships are patrolling the river and preventing their import. As for the British in the concession, because two compatriots have been humiliated while trying to go to the British Concession's racecourse, they are determined to stay in the concession. Yesterday, a British national, a male, intended to go to the racecourse, but was ordered by Japanese soldiers to take off his clothes and stand naked for inspection. The cans he was carrying were opened. Another British national, a female, was also insulted by the patrol officers, who slandered her in Chinese. The British national, who had some knowledge of Chinese, was ashamed and indignant upon hearing this and almost became hysterical. Japanese sentries were also present at the time, and she was only able to pass with the assistance of some German nationals. In addition, Mrs. Tangna Lai, a British national, and Mrs. Luo Jie, an American national, found the indoor temperature in the concession to be 105 degrees Fahrenheit, making it unbearable. They went beyond the boundary to breathe fresh air. When they passed through the wooden fence, the Japanese did not stop them, but when they returned to the boundary, they refused to allow them to pass. After much negotiation, there was no result. The two had to walk two miles, detour to another entrance, and were finally allowed to pass. These two are both natives of China. Furthermore, a British national named Smith was previously arrested by the Japanese after arguing with a Chinese constable. Although the British Consul General has lodged a protest, he has not yet been released. The British companies Jardine Matheson and Taikoo have telegraphed their Shanghai headquarters, saying that they can continue to ship goods to Tianjin. Eleven ships from the two companies arrived in Tianjin yesterday and docked at the British Concession's wharves. Japanese cruisers did not interfere.</p>
<p>Electrified Wire Mesh, Tightening the Blockade</p>
<p>【Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 19th】 The Japanese military commander in Tianjin issued a notice stating that starting at 9:00 PM on Monday, the wire mesh surrounding the British and French concessions will be electrified. According to Chinese sources, the wire is 50 kilometers long and has 220 volts of electricity. The notice was written in English.</p>
<p>British Consul General Issues Notice</p>
<p>【Reuters, London, 19th】 The situation here remains calm on the surface. The British Consul General has issued a notice requesting that British nationals remain in the concession and not go out unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>British Ships Risking Danger to Dock in the Concession</p>
<p>【Reuters, Tianjin, 19th】 Although the Japanese blockade of food is extremely strict, two large British ships were able to break through the Japanese inspection on the Hai River and dock at the British Concession's embankment. Therefore, the owners of these ships immediately telegraphed their Shanghai offices to resume loading goods for Tianjin. (Note: The British Consulate had previously advised them to temporarily suspend shipping.)</p>
<p>Japanese Threatening Chinese Constables in the Concession</p>
<p>【Reuters, Tianjin, 19th】 Japanese military secret agents, dressed in civilian clothes, distributed leaflets to the Chinese police of the British Concession's Municipal Council today, threatening them. If the Chinese police do not immediately separate from the British Concession authorities, the Japanese side will take "action" against them. Regarding this Japanese action, the British Consul General will lodge a strong protest.</p>
<p>Gulangyu Food Supplies, Escorted by Warships</p>
<p>【Reuters, Seven Seas, 19th】 According to news from Gulangyu, the British, French, and American authorities there have recently formed an International Food Committee, preparing to use foreign ships to transport food into the area because the blockade there has not been lifted.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th】 Shanghai Foreign News: Reliable sources report that the food situation on Gulangyu is deteriorating. The authorities plan to send British and American warships to transport food to Gulangyu to aid the foreigners there.</p>
<h3>New Interior Minister Zhou Zhongyue Announces Internal Administrative Policies: Rectify Discipline, Improve Administrative Cadres, and Strive to Advance Relief and Anti-Smoking Efforts</h3>
<p>【Dalu News Agency, Guizhou】 After He Jian was transferred, the National Government immediately appointed Zhou Zhongyue as the new Minister of the Interior and Zhang Weihan as the Vice Minister of Political Affairs. After being appointed, the two arrived at the ministry together at 1:00 PM on the 16th, officially took office, and summoned ministry officials to give them some words of encouragement. At noon, Zhou made a written statement to the press, stating that he considered the training of strong men, charitable relief, and the vigorous implementation of smoking bans to be the important tasks that need to be strengthened and developed. The statement is attached below.</p>
<p>Zhou's Statement</p>
<p>I am weak and lack talent, and I am afraid I will not be able to bear the heavy responsibility. This time, I was ordered by the Central Government to serve as Minister of the Interior. I repeatedly asked to decline, but was not granted approval. I can only encourage myself to serve the country. Today, I am being asked about my political views. I believe that the Ministry of the Interior has been established for a long time, has legal responsibilities, and has plans drawn up by previous leaders. We should follow laws and regulations and implement them effectively. There are no special political views, but there are a few things I should pay attention to now, which can be summarized briefly: (1) Actively promote local government affairs to adapt to wartime essentials. During the war of resistance, the military is the top priority, but internal administration, such as the training of strong men, charitable relief, immigration and reclamation, and local defense, are all related to the military. We should intensify our efforts to implement military service, strengthen mass organizations, and protect the rear to strengthen the war of resistance and achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>Improve Internal Administration</p>
<p>(2) Earnestly improve internal administration to establish a foundation for national construction. Our war of resistance is not a simple military struggle, but a political war to defend the nation's independence. Therefore, we are not only resisting the invasion of Japanese warlords, but also completing the task of nation-building. Nation-building is a vast undertaking, but in the process of the war of resistance, we must start with the most essential and basic parts. Regarding national construction, we have the instructions of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Strategy for National Construction and the Fundamentals of National Construction. Also, the War of Resistance and National Construction Program passed by the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in March 1938, such as improving mass self-defense organizations, completing local autonomy conditions, improving political institutions at all levels, and rectifying the discipline of officials at all levels, are all the responsibilities within the scope of internal affairs. In addition, conducting a census, reorganizing the police, strictly prohibiting smoking, and paying attention to hygiene are all important policies at present. We should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and the Central Government's program, concentrate our efforts and strive to advance to lay a good foundation for politics and society.</p>
<p>Local Politics</p>
<p>(3) Adjust local political institutions to promote administrative efficiency. The War of Resistance and National Construction Program lists the improvement of political institutions at all levels, and the lower-level institutions are particularly important, so I will discuss it in particular. Originally, local governments are institutions that directly govern civil affairs and are also the last institutions to directly receive orders from the central and provincial governments. All national internal affairs laws are to be implemented by the county local governments. If the organization of county local political institutions is not perfect and all government orders cannot be promoted, then the plans and policies of the upper-level political institutions will become empty talk. Since the outbreak of this war of resistance, many unhealthy facts have been discovered in local politics, which are often inflexible and insufficient to cope with the situation in this extraordinary period. Our highest leader has seen this and formulated the "Draft of the Relationship between Party and Government Institutions below the County Level" in 1938 as a preliminary design draft. The County Government Planning Committee was also established to discuss the facilities of local political institutions in detail. In the Party and Government Cadre Training Class, he gave a lecture on "Determining the Issue of Local Organizations below the County Level," which has detailed plans for party-government relations and organizational organizations, which can be used as our preparation for transforming county government. We hope that this plan can be implemented as soon as possible to meet the requirements of the times and be in line with local conditions.</p>
<p>Administrative Personnel</p>
<p>(4) Train administrative personnel at all levels to complete the work of political tutelage. All national laws and regulations depend on the promotion of local governments, as mentioned above. We know that the more human society evolves, the more local public affairs there are. Also, during the war of resistance, the position of local governments is more important. However, national laws and regulations are pushed to the counties, and the counties push them to the villages. Because the villagers do not have political literacy, good gentlemen often shrink back, and there are too few people who advocate public affairs among the masses. Therefore, the lack of effectiveness of local autonomy over the years and the difficulty in implementing conscription and raising public debt are all due to this. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Fundamentals of National Construction require that before implementing party politics, there must be a stage of political tutelage. In recent years, the training of the masses has not been universal, so the work of political tutelage has not yet been completed. Now, when the country is in serious crisis, we must obtain a large number of outstanding elements in society, cultivate practical talents, to lead the masses, mobilize people's power, and concentrate the nation's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to contribute to the country, so that we can complete the great cause of war resistance and national construction. I have just arrived at the ministry and am not yet familiar with the ministry's affairs, so I can only talk about a few points that I have thought of at present. As for the actual situation in internal administration in the future, it must be developed with the national policies at any time, which cannot be predicted at this moment.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Situation: British and Japanese Still Deadlocked; Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons; Roosevelt Closely Monitors Developments</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning to discuss the situation in Tianjin. Prime Minister Chamberlain will give a detailed report to the House of Commons this afternoon on the development of the Tianjin Incident.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to a question in the House of Commons regarding the Tianjin Incident, stated today that the Tianjin Incident has become a general policy issue. The request for the extradition of the four Chinese has now been muddled and is no longer of great importance. Regarding this matter, no official note has yet been received from the Japanese government. He hopes that this matter can still be resolved locally.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 19th] According to the Washington correspondent of The Times, the State Department denied today that Britain and France are approaching the United States, offering a plan for joint action between the three countries to deal with Japan's opposition to foreign concessions in China. However, President Roosevelt is closely monitoring the development of the Far Eastern situation at all times.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 18th] Sources close to the Foreign Office here recently declared that the hope for a compromise solution to the Tianjin Incident is extremely slim. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss various preventive measures and economic retaliation methods. The former is intended to prevent further incidents in Tianjin that could lead to dangerous conflicts. The latter involves implementing the following measures in order within a few days if the current dispute cannot be resolved locally in a friendly manner: 1. Abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911. 2. Impose high import duties on Japanese goods entering British colonies. 3. Restrict the import volume of Japanese goods. 4. Counter Japanese currency with special measures and intensify support for Chinese legal tender. Up to now, the British government has not asked the United States for support to avoid any appearance of coercing the United States. However, it is expected that if Britain takes strong action, the United States will also participate.</p>
<p>Will Japan Soften?</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] "The Times" published an article today stating, "According to recent news from Tokyo, the Japanese government seems to be beginning to seek negotiations. The Japanese army in North China issued a declaration on the 13th of this month, the threatening tone of which is unacceptable to any self-respecting country. However, the semi-official declaration issued last Saturday and Sunday has gradually softened. It seems premature to think that Japan has used its diplomatic means to deal with this matter. However, if Japan is indeed prepared to seek a solution through diplomatic means, it would be a good thing. Otherwise, the British government should take resolute action to protect its interests in the Far East, as demanded by public opinion."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The "Daily Telegraph" reported, "There are many ways to make Japan lose 'face.' Even with this unwarranted oppression implemented by Japan, there is more than one way for us to implement economic retaliation. But at the same time, most importantly, the residents besieged and blockaded within Tianjin must not be allowed to suffer starvation. If diplomatic channels cannot be used to persuade Japan to stop the transportation of food, then British warships must be responsible for providing relief. American expatriates are involved along with British expatriates. Admiral Yarnell's visit to Tianjin may be a turning point in this matter." The newspaper also stated that it is absolutely unacceptable to abandon the concessions, "The imperialism of the Western powers may have forced China to establish many unfair transactions, but the imperialism of Japan has absolutely no transactions to speak of. Its purpose is to use the intimidation of bayonets to plunder China's resources and manpower."</p>
<p>A Wave of Strong Voices in Britain!</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] British Admiral Keyes, in a speech to participants in an air defense volunteer parade in London today, stated: "Japan, with the support of Germany and Italy, launched the Tianjin Incident, which is tantamount to declaring war on Britain. This provocative act must be met with resolute retaliation." Admiral Keyes believes that if Britain can make a determination, maintain a strong stance, and show the world that Britain is prepared to fight aggressors with its wealth, industry, and manpower, the result will be victory without moving a single soldier.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Labor MP Greenwood, in a speech in West Bromwich today, said, "Japan, believing it is encouraged by its European friends, has deliberately disregarded Britain and its own international obligations. We urgently need to show countries with dictatorial regimes and military juntas whether Britain and other democratic countries in the Far East or Western Europe can tolerate this organized disregard for the foundations of international law and the attempt to rule the world by force. World peace is now endangered, but this is not what the people of Germany, Italy, and Japan want. It is caused by the ambitions of the rulers of these three countries. These ambitions must be defeated." Greenwood also criticized the British government's policies, asserting that the threatening situation was also caused by British policies.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Today, all the newspapers here have commented extensively on the Far Eastern situation. "Le Petit Journal" issued a warning, saying that if they continue to amuse themselves by igniting the gunpowder keg next to them, the final explosion in the Far East will be difficult to avoid. The newspaper also said that the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Incident should be resolved, because restoring normal relations between Britain and Japan is in their mutual fundamental interest. "Le Temps" stated, "Effective economic sanctions must have the support of military force. Therefore, the meeting between the British and French commanders in Singapore has special significance." The famous political commentator Patina wrote in "L'Ordre," "It is not difficult for Japan to seize the concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin by force, but sooner or later it will be subjected to the influence of Europe's determination to resist, and it will not be able to withstand the powerful economic sanctions of Britain, France, and the United States."</p>
<p>Attacking from All Sides!</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th] Since Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, newspapers in various democratic countries in Europe have unanimously condemned Japan's barbaric actions and urged the British government to take strong countermeasures. The position taken by Swiss newspapers is the same as that of Britain, France, and other countries. "Tribune de Genève," a major Swiss newspaper, recently published an editorial stating that after Japan encountered heroic resistance from China, it turned to attacking white countries. The League of Nations' protection of individual countries aiding China has already taken effect. The Chinese legal tender supported by Western countries will become one of the most stable currencies in the world, while the Japanese yen has only fictitious value. Japan has suffered losses in Shanghai and Gulangyu, and now it is attacking the Tianjin concessions, its purpose is nothing more than to hinder British and French interests, while hoping that the United States will adopt a detached attitude. However, in order to restore the balance of power in the Far East, the Americans should actively intervene.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 19th] Soviet newspapers remained silent on the Tianjin situation until yesterday, when they published a commentary stating that the Tianjin situation was nothing more than an excuse for Japan to create conflict. This is no different from other recent incidents involving British expatriates in China. The current tense situation in the Far East is due to Japan's intention to drive British and American interests out of China and to seize the public concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other seaports.</p>
<h3>Italian Fleet Cruises off the Coast of Morocco</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 18th] The ships of the Italian Navy's First Fleet, including two battleships, ten cruisers, and more than twenty destroyers and torpedo boats, led by Admiral Bigati, are scheduled to set sail from the Port of Naples tomorrow morning and cruise to Spain, Portugal, and the African coast of Morocco for about half a month. In addition, according to the Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma," the Italian Second Fleet will also sail to the eastern Mediterranean Sea for a cruise in the near future.</p>
<h3>The King's Whereabouts: Safe Passage Through the Iceberg Zone</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] According to a special correspondent of Reuters on the "Empress of Britain" liner today, the ship carrying the King and Queen has safely passed through the iceberg zone. When the ship left the iceberg zone at 3:00 pm, the King and Queen were resting. The King and Queen visited the three escorting destroyers last night. The wind and waves were treacherous at the time, but the King and Queen remained calm.</p>
<h3>German Troops Still on the Move on the Slovak Border; Ten Divisions Concentrated</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 19th] It is reported that a large number of German troops continued to be transferred to the Slovak border last weekend. A large number of tanks, armored vehicles, and transport vehicles drove east through here. It is heard that about ten German divisions are currently concentrated on the border, mostly stationed near Ostrava.</p>
<h3>Vatican Representative Leaves Warsaw; Peace Talks Concluded; No Word on Resolution of Danzig</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 19th] The Vatican's special envoy, Monsignor Mattei, left here last night for Rome to report to the Pope on his recent talks with the Polish President and Foreign Minister. He also visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck again on Saturday and Sunday for talks. Officials here acknowledge that Mattei expressed something regarding a peaceful resolution of the Danzig dispute. It is said that if the outcome of Mattei's talks here is satisfactory, the Vatican will propose a motion to Germany.</p>
<h3>On Anglo-Soviet Negotiations</h3>
<p>-- Written by Ingram, Translated by Shi Chang</p>
<p>From the recent speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to the Congress, we can see that there are still some obstacles between London and Moscow that cannot be completely broken. Therefore, the great alliance to deal with the Axis powers has been delayed for a long time. Mutual suspicion between Britain and the Soviet Union continues to exist. This suspicion is very dangerous. It can undermine the signing of the entire alliance. We have very high hopes for the Anglo-Soviet agreement, so that the invasion becomes a cleanup operation that even Hitler fears, and avoids a European war.</p>
<p>Hitler is a cunning and arrogant observer. He is closely watching the actions of London, Moscow, and Poland. If these countries do not show trust in each other, then even if an alliance is finally concluded, it will not frighten the invincible Hitler!</p>
<p>He believes that suspicion during the negotiation period can hinder actual actions in the future. Poland and Romania, according to his speculation, can only accept the Red Army's minimum assistance. Moreover, military command cannot be unified, and the forces of all parties cannot cooperate. In this situation, effective results cannot be produced. On the other hand, in the Axis countries, all resources are centrally managed, and rapid surprise attacks can be carried out to destroy the enemy's alliance. Therefore, the danger of the current stalemate in Anglo-Soviet negotiations is very obvious. This will not only fail to stop the enemy's aggressive actions, but will also facilitate the enemy's surprise attacks!</p>
<p>The alliance of Fascist Axis countries is very strong. This is not only a defensive alliance, but also an offensive alliance of aggressors. Unity in peacetime is consistent. Once an incident occurs, the leader's order is the law. In 1934, the Soviet Union learned about the situation in Germany after Hitler came to power, and quickly changed its entire international policy, joining the League of Nations, establishing the Franco-Soviet alliance, and so on. British policy has also undergone a transformation, even negotiating with countries that oppose communism. This is really a miracle, and this miracle has finally come.</p>
<p>Many minor difficulties have occurred in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The main obstacle has now been removed. The three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have jointly recognized equal and reciprocal obligations. The main difficulty raised by Molotov was the guarantee for the three Baltic countries. This guarantee is indirect protection for the Soviet Union. We believe that if Germany is determined to attack the Soviet Union, it will simultaneously advance into the Baltic region with its naval, land, and air forces, and will not hesitate to destroy the neutrality of Latvia, Estonia, and Finland. These weak countries have no power to resist, and perhaps they dare not resist. Then, can't Germany use these countries as bases for attacking the Soviet Union? Regarding the issue of guarantees, Britain and France have already agreed.</p>
<p>Britain and France proposed providing guarantees to countries that have been invaded and are prepared to defend themselves, but the Baltic countries are unwilling to accept guarantees because they are afraid of offending Hitler. In other words, they have seen the seemingly united Axis alliance and the Anglo-Soviet negotiations full of suspicion, and they are wondering which side is stronger. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are firmly united and conclude a mutual assistance alliance, this suspicion can be eliminated. At the same time, joint military actions should be taken to defend the neutrality of the Baltic countries. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland should also have the same treatment.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance can cope with war when war breaks out. But what is more important is that in peacetime, mutual assistance can be obtained.</p>
<p>Many people believe that providing economic benefits to Fascist countries can stop their aggressive ambitions. This is a big mistake. What they want is power, not oil! Their goal is not the welfare of the people, but to seize power, oppress others, and indulge in 'appeasing' Fascist dictators. People seem to have forgotten that Japan continues to invade China, and Germany and Italy have destroyed Czechoslovakia and damaged Spain. Therefore, our military strategy should be to stop Hitler from committing further aggression.</p>
<p>Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should immediately conclude an alliance, including military provisions, so that aggressors have no way to start. This is the only proper way to stop aggression and avoid a European war.</p>
<p>A Short Comment</p>
<h3>A Scholar Cannot Be Robbed of His Will</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on the 18th proved that the assassin who assassinated Qu Shaoyi of Shen Bao was instigated by the Wang faction. The telegram also specifically pointed out: "The so-called 'Communist Extermination Special Agent Command' was established by the Wang faction in Shanghai, and the funding was provided by the Japanese. Recently, it has repeatedly sent threatening letters to various newspapers."</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Jingwei and others use the name of "Communist Extermination" to help the Japanese harm and intimidate all of us who advocate justice, love the motherland, support the central government, and call for unity in the media. It is also not worth fearing. Let us look at the statement of the Shanghai Guidance News on the 18th! It said: "Upholding our original intention and moving forward, we cannot be shaken by intimidation and despicable means!" The sage said: "The army can be robbed of its commander, but a common man cannot be robbed of his will." How admirable and inspiring is the media in Shanghai!</p>
<h3>Massive Arrest of Unlicensed Hawkers</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, detectives strictly enforced laws against hawkers, resulting in the arrest of more than eighty male and female unlicensed hawkers in the central district. The news was reported in great detail by various newspapers, making it worthy of being read as a novel—however, after reading this news, I wonder if the reader will also think about it for a moment? Is the poor business of formal hawkers in the Central Market entirely due to the evil deeds of these "unlicensed hawkers"? Where do these "unlicensed hawkers" come from? After these "unlicensed hawkers" are arrested, will the business of formal hawkers flourish? Also, how will these arrested hawkers be dealt with?</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons on Anglo-Soviet Negotiations; Some Difficulties Remain; Germany Intensifies Alienation Conspiracy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in answering a question in the House of Commons this afternoon about the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, stated that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations are continuing to progress. MP Adams asked whether there were any other outstanding issues in addition to the status of the Baltic countries. The Prime Minister replied, "Yes, there are some other difficult points in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 18th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow. At that time, in addition to discussing the situation in Tianjin, China, it will also study what methods can be used to intensify negotiations with the Soviet Union so that an agreement can be reached as soon as possible. According to news received by the British government, Germany is making every effort to keep the Soviet Union neutral, engaging in business negotiations with the country and dissolving it with a non-aggression pact. Britain must catch up quickly. The Soviet government has submitted a new memorandum, which British Ambassador Sir Seeds has forwarded to London. It will be submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion tomorrow. The memorandum strongly states that Britain and France should provide unconditional and automatic guarantees for the northwestern border of the Soviet Union. That is, whether the Soviet Union is directly or indirectly attacked, Britain and France should automatically and unconditionally provide assistance. It is heard that the British government has exchanged views with the French government on this issue, and will send a new instruction to Ambassador Seeds by telegram tonight to propose a brief plan for the security of the northwestern border of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 19th] British newspapers, in view of the increasingly serious situation in Tianjin, unanimously urged the British government to intensify Anglo-Soviet negotiations. The organs of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have requested the government to make concessions to the Soviet Union in order to consolidate Britain's political and military position in the Far East. The Anglo-Soviet alliance is enough to destroy Japan's policy. The "News Chronicle" stated that once the Anglo-Soviet alliance agreement is signed, it is doubtful whether Japan can challenge Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and even the United States.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Utters Absurdities Again in Danzig; Ambitions Revealed Between Brags</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Danzig, 18th] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in a speech at the closing ceremony of the Danzig Cultural Congress today, said that the German characteristics of Danzig are difficult for even its opponents to deny. According to his broadcast speech, Goebbels said, "The most important thing is Danzig's will and determination to return to Germany. Political barriers can be temporarily changed, but race and language are difficult to eliminate. Although I am in Danzig, I am as if I am in Germany." Regarding culture, Germany is a pioneer, something that democratic countries cannot hope to match. Goebbels also said that radio broadcasting is the most effective way to guide the people. "We are now in the vortex of political and economic warfare, so we will educate the people of the whole country in every possible way, unite the hearts of the people at home, and jointly deal with world events. Other countries have resources and wealth, but Germany is an unsatisfied country. German history has just begun today. We are a country where the whole nation is mobilized for war. You can ignore the name of the Free City. The German people will always be with you. Führer Hitler is closely watching the development of Danzig and our future."</p>
<h3>Hitler Celebrates with Arab Envoys; Wondering What Tricks He's Playing Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] It was announced here today that Hitler met with Dar El, the special envoy of Arab King Ibn Saud yesterday. This announcement is quite surprising. The two met at Berchtesgaden and had tea and talked for a long time, but the nature of the content is unknown.</p>
<h3>Irish Free State Declares Stance; We Will Not Offend Unless Offended</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dublin, 18th] During the recent discussion of the budget in the House of Representatives of the Southern Irish Free State, Executive Council Chairman de Valera made an important speech, stating that rumors that government officials had told people who enlisted in the army that they would fight against Britain and Northern Ireland were nonsense. In fact, our goal in training soldiers is only to strengthen national defense. The policy implemented by the government can be summarized in one sentence, that is, to avoid being involved in the vortex of war within the scope of its power. However, in order to maintain a fixed neutral position, there must be sufficient strength. The task of strengthening the military is precisely for this. In short, we will not offend unless offended. Even if war breaks out, we will still maintain business relations with Britain, because this is necessary for the economic life of our country. If the enemy believes that it is enough to hinder their hope of victory and obstruct it, then we must rise up to resist and ensure that our country can continue to trade with Britain.</p>
<h3>Franco-Vietnamese Commander Transfers to Singapore</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Saigon, 18th] General Martin, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces stationed in Vietnam, recently flew here from Hanoi and transferred to the Port of Singapore to meet with Vice Admiral Godfroy, Commander of the French Far Eastern Fleet, and military authorities from the British Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in the Far East to discuss military cooperation between the two sides in the Far East.</p>

<h3>1939: Hollywood's Prophecies</h3>
<p>Believe it or not</p>
<p>When it comes to superstition, whether in China or abroad, people always like to put China first. Only heaven knows if that's true. In reality, the most superstitious people in the world are the Americans in the Western Hemisphere. Thus, 'thirteen', 'Friday the 13th', and 'next to the building' are all inexplicable taboos. And the most superstitious place in American superstition is, of course, Hollywood. To say nothing else, in Hollywood, there are thousands of people who make a living specializing in astrology. Every year-end and new year, prophecies come one after another. Major newspapers, tabloids, magazines, and publications are filled with them. And privately, big directors and big stars constantly seek out their astrological consultants to predict the coming year's fortune. Is it a good time to make a film? Or is it a good time to fall in love? Below, we will introduce the standard Hollywood prophecies for 1939. These prophecies are the work of famous Hollywood reporter and prophet, Chris. This forecast was published in the New York Progressive Report in January 1939. It has two special features: First, it talks about general Hollywood events, not just the private lives of celebrities. Second, it makes specific predictions about the facts, names, and months, rather than just making vague statements like those who hang up a sheep's head but sell dog meat. Moreover, after six months, several of the predictions did come true, which is somewhat reasonable. Now, please see the main text below. January:</p>
<p>The names of the Canadian quintuplet child stars will continuously appear in various newspaper news columns, but it will have nothing to do with movies.</p>
<p>(Note): This prediction has already been fulfilled. The New York World's Fair invited the Dionne quintuplets to perform at the opening ceremony on May 1st. At the same time, the British King and Queen also prepared to "meet the saints," the Dionne quintuplets. Both news items were published in various newspapers.</p>
<p>Luise Rainer, the female lead of "The Good Earth," will receive some kind of award.</p>
<p>(Note: This prediction has also been fulfilled. Luise Rainer toured the United States last year and received the 1938 Travel Award, which was presented in January.)</p>
<p>February:</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin will officially announce the content of his new work.</p>
<p>(Note: This prediction has been confirmed. Charlie Chaplin announced his new film "The Great Dictator" in February.)</p>
<p>The golden award for the best acting performance of 1938 will not go to Bette Davis, but to another more famous actress.</p>
<p>(Note: This prediction also came true. On February 23rd, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that the winner was Norma Shearer, the female lead of "Marie Antoinette." Bette Davis's ranking was after Norma Shearer.)</p>
<p>March:</p>
<p>Famous director Frank Borzage will fall ill.</p>
<p>Carole Lombard will be involved in a lawsuit due to income tax issues.</p>
<p>(Note: Neither of the above predictions has been confirmed.)</p>
<p>April:</p>
<p>The wedding of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, scheduled for this month, will be postponed due to some reason.</p>
<p>(Note: Clark Gable married Carole Lombard in late April and was not postponed for any reason.)</p>
<p>May:</p>
<p>Samuel Goldwyn will gather many famous writers to co-write a movie script, but it will ultimately not be filmed.</p>
<p>(Note: There seems to be no news of this?)</p>
<p>June:</p>
<p>Li Sislian Howard will self-fund the production of a color film.</p>
<p>Major film companies will compete to buy a famous script, and MGM will win, but it will be banned from filming by the film censorship board.</p>
<p>July:</p>
<p>Three Soviet national defense films will be screened in New York, one of which will cause a protest from Japan.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo will return to her homeland again</p>
<p>August:</p>
<p>Child star Shirley Temple will suffer from a surgical illness and require surgery.</p>
<p>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation will change its internal organization, and a certain well-known star will engage in litigation with the company authorities.</p>
<p>September:</p>
<p>Gary Cooper will receive some kind of honorary award.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's new work will be completed, and he will announce his official divorce from Paulette Goddard.</p>
<p>October:</p>
<p>Maybelline's cosmetics company will be very profitable. Horror star Boris Karloff will travel to Europe.</p>
<p>November:</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's completed new film will be praised by some audiences but opposed by others.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor will be in a car accident but will only suffer minor injuries.</p>
<p>December:</p>
<p>Star Mickey Rooney will receive a strange gift on Christmas.</p>
<p>Among all the film companies, the most profitable will be RKO Pictures.</p>
<h3>One Person, One Day</h3>
<p>Once, the New York Women's Federation held a carnival, and one of the events was a Charlie Chaplin costume contest. In advance, they specifically telegraphed Hollywood, asking the comedian himself to serve as a judge. Chaplin, because he happened to be busy, telegraphed back that he could not attend, much to his regret.</p>
<p>However, the carnival still opened, and the costume contest was held as planned. It is said that on that day, traffic was heavy, and the scene was grand. Even more enthusiastic were the participants in the Charlie Chaplin costume contest. The small mustaches and torn shoes were the same color, and the canes and old felt hats flew everywhere. The real and fake Charlie Chaplins were simply indistinguishable.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, the three judges looked left and right, deliberating and deciding on the top three. Amidst applause, the three winners went on stage to receive their awards. A large silver trophy, a silver shield, and a silver medal for third place. Everyone was praising the first-place mustache, the second-place torn shoes, and the third-place figure, which was also not bad... Suddenly, the third-place guy started to speak on stage.</p>
<p>"Thank you all for your kindness in selecting me as third place." After saying this, he took off his hat and cane, and pulled off his mustache. Who was he? It was none other than Charlie Chaplin himself.</p>
<p>"Mr. Manager, can I open this box and sell a bullet to this gentleman? He wants to commit suicide!"</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>"Transport trucks as prison vans, detectives make a big arrest of hawkers." The Hong Kong police authorities, after all, have extraordinary methods. Such a wonderful plan, how did they think of it? It's a pity that it's a "big arrest of hawkers," not exciting or stimulating enough, still lacking a bit of excitement.</p>
<p>A man named Huang, twenty-three years old, committed fifty-seven cases single-handedly, truly worthy of being the king of model thieves. I think this person probably has a penchant for stealing, with nothing to do after a full meal, stealing for fun. What other explanation could there be?</p>
<p>"A man named Lin, addicted to heroin, fell one day, breaking his right foot, and was hospitalized for bone grafting surgery. The doctor discovered that the heroin poison had penetrated deeply, causing the bone marrow to decay, making grafting impossible, so the right foot was amputated." Heroin addicts, be careful of falling.</p>
<p>The Mong Kok Island brawl and assault case last month was tried yesterday. The deceased was murdered by "a person of unknown name." The witness was angry and did not provide a complete and truthful testimony. Three people were fined fifty dollars or imprisoned for one month, and one person was fined one hundred dollars or imprisoned for two months. Serves them right, why did the witness lie?</p>
<p>Answer: Yesterday, there was a small problem with the candy distribution that was originally scheduled to be announced in three days. Unexpectedly, yesterday alone, we received as many as one hundred and eighty-six letters with answers, and two-thirds of them were correct. This really overwhelmed me a bit. Thinking about it, I have to announce it earlier today.</p>
<p>When this question was posed, there was a bit of carelessness, so there could be several answers: Any answer that is: 79, 160, 241, 322, 403, is considered correct. Afterwards, you can add 81 to get this number.</p>
<p>To thank the respondents for their enthusiasm, I specially discussed it with Manager Cai of Caizhi Zhai and made an exception to increase the prizes. The first three names will receive six zongzi, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth names will each receive three zongzi. The rest who answered correctly will receive one zongzi each, to express my gratitude and help with their elegant interests. Today, Cai Zhai specially made a batch of zongzi, please gentlemen and ladies come and pick them up before 2 pm.</p>
<p>The first six names are published below, and the rest are welcome to go directly to Caizhi Zhai, where there is a detailed statistical table.</p>
<p>(1) A certain gentleman from the Bank of Communications</p>
<p>(This gentleman had someone knock on the door of Caizhi Zhai at eight o'clock in the morning to deliver the answer.)</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Feng Baosen from the Bank of Shanghai</p>
<p>(3) Ms. Tang Ruoying from the China Travel Theater Troupe</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Wu Zhongqi on the third floor of Standard Chartered Bank (5) Mr. Zheng Xianchao from the Commercial Press</p>
<p>(6) Mr. Tan Kunyuan from the Peninsula Hotel</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to announce that in a couple of days, I will ask another difficult question, please answer it.</p>

<h3>Maritime Storm Nine</h3>
<p>— By Captain Lauton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous excerpt: In the autumn of 1914, the "Sui Mei" steamship (Kailong Boqi) was carrying eight million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the radio operator of the Qiukes Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took advantage of the ship to travel around Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator Lu Jialuo and the ship's German radio operator Baufu. When Jack was working for Bau, he received a strange message saying that Britain and Germany had declared war, and British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then began to run aimlessly. Soon, the radio again reported that there was an iceberg nearby...</p>
<p>"I hope he heard it and stops the ship," Bill said. "I'm not afraid, but running at full speed in such dense fog, with an iceberg ahead, is not very appropriate."</p>
<p>"I only think the only good thing is that these passengers don't know. They are anxious enough, and if they knew there was an iceberg, I believe someone would put on a straitjacket."</p>
<p>"Really, only the Americans and British on this ship have the leisure to be indifferent. Today, in the smoking room, I saw several American millionaires planning to buy the ship so they could pass safely."</p>
<p>"That's indeed the American way," Jack laughed. "What was the result?"</p>
<p>"The captain told them that the ship was not for sale, even if they paid the price of the gold in the vault."</p>
<p>Jack found the captain in the front cabin, where he was seriously discussing with some of the crew.</p>
<p>"Well, what's the news?" The captain saw Jack come in.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's not good news. Ka Li Donavan just told the Lisa that there's an iceberg ahead."</p>
<p>Some of the crew exchanged glances, all looking at the captain, hoping for orders in the face of such a great danger on the water during navigation.</p>
<p>Their second mate, Mi Qin, was the first to ask: "Captain, are you going to change course or reduce speed?"</p>
<p>The big-bearded captain glared at him and raised his big fist, hitting the table hard.</p>
<p>"We're going forward as usual!" He said loudly; "Rather than let the transport ship fall into British hands, I'd rather it be smashed to pieces."</p>
<p>"But there are so many passengers!" Jack exclaimed. "Really—"</p>
<p>"Mr. Red, I'm the one in charge of giving orders on this ship, and I order you to go forward at full speed."</p>
<p>Five became enemies</p>
<p>Hearing the news that Jack brought back, Bill Nanuo shrugged and said:</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised, in my previous marine life, I've met many Germans who hold this belief, that they'd rather sink the ship than let others take advantage of it."</p>
<p>"But this is terrible, Bill," Jack protested, "at any time, there may be a smash, and—"</p>

<h3>Increased Export of Local Goods is Expected After Foreign Exchange Rate Adjustment. The Success of the Southwest Customs Management Has Transformed into Trade Surplus. Trade Deficits in Shanghai and Tianjin Customs May Be Reduced Hereafter.</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Special Dispatch) After the government adjusted foreign exchange rates, although the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai has tightened, it is beneficial to China's balance of international payments, reduces the import of useless foreign loans, eliminates trade deficits, and encourages exports. The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee is determined to maintain the stability of foreign exchange with all its strength. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Southwest Trade Surplus, Customs Trade Deficit</p>
<p>After making every effort to eliminate trade deficits at various customs, the southwest Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, Longzhou, Beihai Qiongzhou, Leizhou, Jiangmen, and Wenzhou, Shantou, have all become trade surplus customs. However, the customs in the occupied areas are still in trade deficit, and the numbers are increasing, especially Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, Xiamen, etc. For example, from January to April this year, Tianjin's trade deficit was 74.307 million yuan, Shanghai's trade deficit was 72.316 million yuan, Jiaozhou's trade deficit was 14.951 million yuan, and Yantai's trade deficit was 5.009 million yuan.</p>
<p>April's Trade Deficit Sets a New Record</p>
<p>Regarding the nation's foreign trade, when the war first started, from September to December of the 26th year of the Republic of China, each month changed from trade deficit to trade surplus, with a total trade surplus of 53.627 million yuan in four months. From June to September of the 27th year, each month was also in trade surplus, with a total trade surplus of 20.638 million yuan in four months. However, from October of last year to April of this year, all were in trade deficit, with a total trade deficit of 156.242 million yuan. Especially the trade deficit in April of this year set a new record high since the war, totaling 56.541 million yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>New Measures for the Exchange of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>— Gong Jialin</p>
<p>4. Make the planned control of exports in Central China by the Japanese puppets meaningless. The export from the occupied areas is one of the sources of supply in the black market for foreign exchange. If the organization is determined to control the export of foreign exchange (regardless of whether it can be done), then the supply in the black market for foreign exchange will be further reduced, and the Japanese plan to seize foreign exchange will be even more difficult to implement, and they will only eat their own bitter fruit.</p>
<p>(4) The Legal Tender is Strong, and Japan is Weak.</p>
<p>After the sharp contraction of the legal tender exchange rate, the price of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market has also become slightly stronger, but it is far from the standard it should be. On June 7, the day before the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange in the black market, the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai was 9 jiao 2 fen, and the price of the legal tender was 8 benzi 25. Recently, when the legal tender fell to 6 benzi half, the Japanese yen should have risen to 1 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen, but in reality, it is still hovering within 1 yuan and has not been able to reach parity. It seems quite thought-provoking. In fact, this is not very difficult to explain. Although the Japanese yen is still maintained on the surface at an official rate of 1 shilling 2 benzi in Japan due to the government's strong control, due to the country's financial difficulties, currency inflation, depletion of reserves, deterioration of trade, restrictions on the domestic and foreign use of the Japanese yen, and the failure of the war against China, even the Japanese people themselves, who have a strong sense of patriotism, have expressed pessimism about the future of the Japanese yen. The depreciation of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai open market is the best evidence. On the other hand, the legal tender reserves are still abundant, it can freely purchase goods domestically, and it can freely exchange foreign exchange abroad. The Japanese also firmly believe in the foundation of the legal tender, so as soon as the exchange rate is slightly favorable, they desperately use the Japanese yen to exchange for the legal tender. As a result, the supply of Japanese yuan in the market exceeds the demand, and the exchange rate will naturally fall back. This simple fact has been explained to us by the Japanese themselves about the solid foundation of the legal tender. Do we still need to doubt it? (The End)</p>

<h3>Sweeping Away the "Kiss Donation" Movement</h3>
<p>— Rage Tide</p>
<p>Recently, the air of "kiss donation" has been rampant in Hong Kong. Although this movement has not been put into practice, it has indeed attracted the attention of some members of society.</p>
<p>It is said that the purpose of launching the kiss donation movement is to raise money to contribute to the motherland? Moreover, a woman even published an article in a certain newspaper voluntarily sacrificing her beauty. To be the first practitioner to unveil this movement.</p>
<p>Because the method of this movement is a bit novel, from an objective standpoint, through the method of analysis, how should we evaluate the significance of this novel movement? This is really worth our discussion.</p>
<p>Because this kiss donation movement is a supplement to raising financial resources for the motherland in the War of Resistance, therefore, for this question and the methods it adopts, what kind of excellent or bad effects will it have objectively in the process of practice, and what inevitable impact will it have on society, these are all things that we should give strict consideration to.</p>
<p>In the motherland's sacred war, every Chinese people should concentrate all manpower, material resources, and financial resources into the torrent of the War of Resistance. This is not only an irrefutable responsibility, but also an obligation that must be borne. Therefore, we do not oppose the people's donations to the country; however, we believe that this "kiss donation" method greatly tarnishes the spirit of resisting Japan and saving the country. Because although the kiss donors are for the motherland, those who enjoy the "kiss" themselves, the purpose for which they take out their money, is first and foremost to treat women as objects. According to this motive for setting out, it is very wrong.</p>
<p>To put these shameless carnal and spiritual sensations into the great content of the War of Resistance would be an insult to the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>If we understand the social organization of China, we all clearly know: China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country; although it has undergone the impact of the May Fourth Youth Movement and countless new ideas, due to the deep-rooted existence of the old social system for nine thousand years, even up to now, we can easily smell the legacy of feudalism everywhere. As for the removal of these feudal dregs, it will take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, this "kiss donation" action is bound to arouse criticism from the general public in society, and will produce the opposite effect.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, as long as they are not traitors, every Chinese person is a member of the nation. In the sense of a united front, only when people from all walks of life are linked together and form an iron front can we eliminate the enemy and win the final victory. Therefore, for this layer representing a semi-feudal society, in the technology of national salvation, we must try our best to win their sympathy. Avoid overly blind actions. And avoid causing unnecessary friction between them. Now, without passing through the analysis of social conditions and the grasp of the social foundation, making their children and strangers kiss, this trick will of course immediately make them disgusted, and even further distort the basic task of national salvation work, and should be subjected to all kinds of blows.</p>
<p>Therefore, the effect of this action is greatly contrary to the spirit of the War of Resistance. And if this movement unfortunately gets a local abnormal development, some improper prostitutes will also put forward the "××××" movement at the same time. We further think: what a terrible impact this will form.</p>
<p>For the sake of the revolutionary character of thousands of national salvation workers, and for the sake of the great spirit of the national War of Resistance, we must sweep away the atmosphere of the kiss donation movement.</p>
<p>We raise the giant hand of protest against this incorrect movement.</p>
<h3>The Pit (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Telegram</p>
<p>I swayed and paced off the bridge, my eyes fixed straight ahead, ignoring the fellow to my right.</p>
<p>My legs moved back and forth, quite freely, yet I glanced at him sideways: like half a burnt-down yellow candle, stiff and angry, stuck there. I couldn't help but chuckle...</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard the sound of leather shoes and a gun handle striking. I quickly turned sideways: the seven-member gang was aiming the gun right at my belly. Slowly, I raised my hands, losing the smile on my face. However, he lowered the gun back to his shoulder, took a short rod from his waist, and strode over.</p>
<p>He took three legal tender notes and eight Qin Hui notes from my pocket. He hurriedly stuffed the three notes into his trouser pocket, but tore up all the Qin Hui notes. He smiled slyly, pointed with his finger to the foot of the bridge, and I saw that a pit was being dug there. He, like a mute, raised his right palm above his head and made a gesture with his left palm at knee level. So I swallowed some saliva and walked over: the pit was only three or four feet deep, a little wider than one person, with a small shovel stuck in the pile of dirt beside it.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He repeated the gesture, and smiled slyly again. Did he want me to dig? Were there munitions below? Or his father's grave? He then waved his pistol at me. I stubbornly craned my neck at him, smiled just as wickedly, grabbed the little devilish shovel, and tested it, gently—if it were longer, I could swing it over and send his mother's half-candle to the Western Paradise. So I brandished it, and now he was furious, his eyebrows furrowed, gnashing his teeth, shrinking his legs back a bit, stomping his feet. The expression was like an old monkey with its tail burnt, screeching uselessly.</p>
<p>I pretended to look ahead, but it was completely empty, not even a ghost to be seen. Damn it, I had to obediently "respect the order" and dig. Digging and digging, I stole a glance at the gang member, who was fondling his pistol. I coughed loudly to startle him. He suddenly jumped, his legs shrinking back again, aiming the gun at me. So I dug again, digging... it was very dry, so I spat some saliva into my palm, rubbed it, and dug, shoveling, waiting a while, then glanced at him again: he smiled wickedly and evilly again, then leisurely took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and started puffing.</p>
<p>Digging, digging, picking up mud, the pit was now two feet deeper, and I stopped, coughing loudly again. He strode over, patted my shoulder, and made another gesture; did it need to be this deep? You're out of luck today, old man!</p>
<p>I lazily brandished the shovel thinking: how many munitions are below, who left them here? It was puzzling—digging, digging, digging, observing, observing, it was as if I was digging up his ancestral grave. Digging and digging, the pile of dirt beside the pit was getting higher and higher: strange! My shoulder suddenly felt a sharp pain. Turning my head, I saw that he had hit me with the pistol butt; I shouted, "What? Your father..." The gun was aimed at my throat, black and shiny, and I sullenly bent down again, digging, digging, damn it! I spat hatefully, rubbed my hands: something really did come up below. I would use it to get rid of him decisively! One-on-one, could I still fail? How truly shameful; alright, dig, dig, dig.</p>
<p>I looked over again, he was squatting to pick up the shredded notes, his half-burnt candle-like body even more foolish. Suddenly, my heart almost jumped out of my chest, I couldn't help but raise it up, jump out of the pit in one stride, and give him a faceless beating... I was preparing to deal with him, but he stood up, adjusting the long gun on his back, which clanged.</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Supplement Editor</h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>Every newspaper has a supplement. The indispensability of supplements is already a general understanding. Some people even say that they often encounter people who don't read the editorials or certain news items when reading a newspaper, but there are absolutely none who don't read the supplement; the importance of supplements to people is especially evident in this fact. Some people think that real public opinion should be sought in the supplement. Perhaps there is some truth to this statement.</p>
<p>The importance of supplements is such that the responsibilities of the supplement editor are also self-evident. Of course, supplement editors are respectable in terms of their scholarship and morality. They naturally know the heavy responsibilities they bear and will deal with them appropriately. There is no need for someone like me, who has no editorial experience, to lecture them. However, I think my offering some opinions, especially during this time of war, may provide them with some reference.</p>
<p>First, I hope that the consciousness of the supplement editor is always forward-thinking and never regressive. Therefore, the manuscripts they select will never promote feudal thoughts, superstitions, low-level tastes, or any national dregs. Unless there are special reasons, they will not publish manuscripts written in classical Chinese. They will also improve the use of old-fashioned punctuation with circles added to each sentence in vernacular manuscripts, changing it to modern punctuation. Any text that mentions taking concubines, visiting prostitutes, or other vulgar matters, and seems to describe them with relish, implicitly praising them, will be immediately thrown into the wastepaper basket, no matter what the reason. Whenever selecting a manuscript, they will think about whether publishing it will have a bad influence on readers, hindering social progress and national civilization.</p>
<p>Second, I hope that they are serious, not perfunctory, and not accommodating. Only good manuscripts, or at least manuscripts that are harmless to readers, can be published; otherwise, even if they are introduced by influential people, they should be rejected without hesitation. They should read every submitted manuscript from beginning to end and not discard it just because the submitter is an unknown person, or because the beginning of the manuscript is not good, thereby burying the author's painstaking effort. Of course, it is especially inappropriate to monopolize the "territory" and only use it to cater to their two or three close friends, without any openness, and to not publish manuscripts from strangers, regardless of their quality. For publishable manuscripts, I also hope that they are willing to revise them and proofread them after typesetting, because most submitters are not technically specialized and will inevitably have errors or minor imperfections, so it is necessary to help in this way.</p>
<p>Third, I hope that they will not be used by others, nor will they use it improperly themselves. Publishing texts that tout and flatter is a minor form of exploitation. Attacking others' privacy and slandering others without cause, if they say that they do not intentionally publish such texts, at least they should be blamed for oversight. If they are instructed or bribed by others to propagate some kind of bad idea or doctrine, I think wise editors will certainly be able to distinguish this and that it is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>These three points mostly refer to normal times. As for now, in this time of war and nation-building, in addition to the above three points, I hope that supplement editors will respect the following point:</p>
<p>Only publish works that can uplift the spirit of our compatriots, and absolutely do not publish works that can dissipate morale! Therefore, I hope that editors will not publish literary works that describe romantic scenery. That is to say, I hope that it is best to publish fewer works that express sorrow and resentment, or that expose some kind of dark side of society. Even if it is known to be "eight-legged essays for resisting Japan," one must strive for excellence within this "eight-legged" framework and cannot jump out of this range and publish "nine-legged" or "seven-legged" or any other great articles that are unrelated to reality and cannot promote our fighting spirit with self-satisfaction. Of course, on isolated islands, "the environment" should also be considered, and it is not appropriate to speak out loudly, lest small impatience ruin great plans. But I think a smart editor, and also a patriotic editor, will always find a way to overcome this "environment" to achieve their goals. If everything is attributed to "the environment," and things that are incomprehensible or even poisonous are published, then I must honestly and impolitely say that this person has ulterior motives, and we must impose severe sanctions on them!</p>
<p>These are just a few of the things I hope for. I am ashamed to say that they are just commonplaces, with no new ideas. However, I must honestly say, have the current supplement editors fully achieved all the points we hope for? Of course not completely. Therefore, I still cannot help but mention my expectations to all the editors.</p>
<p>In short, the position of the newspaper supplement is important, and the responsibility of the editor is great. I hope that editors will be responsible to readers, responsible to society, and now even more responsible to the nation and the country, contributing to the joint effort of resisting Japan and building the nation, and promoting world civilization!</p>
<h3>Spark</h3>
<p>— Dawn</p>
<p>In the hazy distance,</p>
<p>A spark flashes,</p>
<p>Bright!</p>
<p>My eyes, buried in the gloomy seven tombs,</p>
<p>Have spent nineteen years of suffering,</p>
<p>And only now have touched the torch of freedom.</p>
<p>My left hand is braced in the mud,</p>
<p>My right hand grips the mountain rocks,</p>
<p>Stomping in one foot,</p>
<p>Then closely following the next step.</p>
<p>Who scattered this slippery layer,</p>
<p>Making me hesitate, unable to open my stride?</p>
<p>Looking back is a blackness full of ghostly shadows,</p>
<p>Only ahead is the spark rising.</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<h3>From Chengdu to Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>6. National Hero</p>
<p>Here, the vegetable garden where the Mian County government is located is also a thatched hut, but it is already on the edge of the plain and transportation is convenient, so there is now ×× unit, number ×××××××, there are faculty and staff dormitories of Northwestern United University, and there is a middle school. The surrounding area is full of slogans for resisting Japan; although the place belongs to Shaanxi, the name of the group is Shanxi Service Nation, there is a branch station here, and the bus must stop briefly to check tickets. A female comrade traveling with me is learning Cantonese from me. There are seven women traveling together, one is a widow. She is bringing four girls and one boy. The female comrade learning to speak is her eldest daughter, about twenty years old. She is the opposite of a female comrade who likes to show off and deliberately pretends to be mysterious, and she has a thoughtful and contemplative personality. After two days of walking on mountain roads, the bus bumped so badly that she vomited several times. I gave her Eight Trigrams Pills and Qi Zhong Shui to take several times. But coming out of the plains and about to arrive, her mood also became cheerful, and she began to learn to speak with me. She said:</p>
<p>"I'll say a sentence in Cantonese and you listen to see if it's right?"</p>
<p>She is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, grew up in Tianjin, and fled through Jinan, Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, to Chengdu, and now enters Shaanxi. I said:</p>
<p>"Okay, say it and let me hear."</p>
<p>She spoke, but I didn't understand. She translated it into Mandarin:</p>
<p>"Shall we go see a movie?"</p>
<p>I translated it into Cantonese for her:</p>
<p>"Tung ngoh tai dianying hui ho um ho?"</p>
<p>She followed and learned, and I answered her:</p>
<p>"Ho!"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>At half past two, we passed Baocheng. From here, going north is Shiji, and going east is Hanzhong (Nanzheng), only thirteen kilometers away. At three o'clock, the bus had arrived at the station north of Nanzheng City. Everyone jumped down from the open-air truck, unloading the suffering of the four-day journey, and their faces showed happy smiles. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>High-ranking Official of the Ministry of Communications Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss Domestic Transportation Construction after the War; Building Highways, Dredging Rivers, and Smooth Water and Land Transportation; Developed Aviation, Postal, and Telecommunications to Open up International Routes</h3>
<p>Since the start of our country's war of resistance, nation-building plans have also been actively promoted at the same time. As far as transportation construction is concerned, such as strengthening public transportation, engaging in road construction, expanding postal, telecommunications, and aviation, and dredging canals and waterways, there have been good results. Internal communication is unimpeded, and the transportation of goods is convenient both internally and externally. According to a high-ranking official of the Ministry of Communications who has just arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing on official business, the current domestic transportation situation is as follows.</p>
<p>Highways</p>
<p>Regarding highways, according to reliable statistics, the current highways and motor roads total 72,140 miles, and the total number of motor vehicles in China is about 72,000, which is about one vehicle per mile. The government has developed highways and has also set up a truck manufacturing plant. As for the management methods, the main roads in the southwestern provinces are all under the jurisdiction of the Southwest Highway Transportation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the northwest is under the jurisdiction of the West Highway Transportation Management of the Ministry of Communications. The Sichuan Highway, which connects the southwest and northwest, is managed by the Sichuan Highway Bureau. The highway from Yunnan to the border of a certain country has also been opened to traffic long ago.</p>
<p>Waterways</p>
<p>In order to avoid the threat of military bombing, the transportation of goods in the interior is mostly changed to waterways. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications is doing its utmost to supervise the dredging of canals and waterways with transportation value in various provinces to assist wartime transportation. Regarding waterway transportation management, there is the Yangtze River Shipping Joint Office jointly established by the China Merchants Bureau and various shipping companies, and the Inland River Shipping Joint Office established by the municipal government bureaus of various commercial ports, which controls the navigation of various ships and small inland river ships in the Yangtze River. In addition, due to the dangerous shoals of the Sichuan River, the method of improving the shoals has been improved, and rescue stations have been set up at dangerous places, using machines to pull the shoals to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Aviation</p>
<p>Aircraft transportation is still being carried out by China and Eurasia Airlines, which are increasing the purchase of aircraft and changing flight routes at any time according to the war situation. Under the circumstances of avoiding destruction by enemy aircraft, efforts are made to maintain air transport. Not only can various important cities in the country be reached from morning to evening, but even the capital of the Soviet Union can be reached in only five days (which used to take seven days). In addition, the direct route from Chongqing to Vietnam can be reached in only a few hours. The direct route from Chongqing to Yangon and then to London has also been tested and will soon be officially opened. As for aviation fuel and repairs, there are also sufficient preparations for supply.</p>
<p>Postal and Telecommunications</p>
<p>Telegraph networks have been added in various provinces in the rear, and many connecting lines have been added between provinces. Many long-distance telephones have also been opened, such as the recent Kunming-Ce, Kunming-Chongqing, Kunming-Rong, Chongqing-Guilin, and Longxi-Chongqing long-distance telephone lines, which have been opened one after another. It is also heard that the amount of copper wire used by the Ministry of Communications in the past year is enough to offset the amount used in the previous ten years. International radio can directly communicate with major European cities. In addition to the establishment of many post offices and agency offices, village and town mail carriers, village and town post offices, and mailboxes in the rear provinces, as well as more than 10,000 miles of new postal routes, military mail is also set up in the war zone and transferred with the position to facilitate postal transportation.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Authorities Improve the Way to Accommodate Chinese Refugees; Can Obtain a Residence Permit from the Philippine Immigration Bureau</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received news from the shipping industry in Hong Kong that the Philippine Immigration Office recently decided to improve the way to accommodate Chinese refugees. In the future, Chinese refugees going to the Philippines and those already in the Philippines, in addition to holding refugee certificates issued by our consulate general, must also obtain a refugee residence permit from the Philippine Immigration Office and pay a handling fee of 2.2 Philippine pesos. It is found that this method is quite convenient for our refugees going to the Philippines. After the immigration office issues a certificate, they can reside in the Philippines until the end of the war in our country. Several batches of refugees are already in the Philippines. After the list is announced by our consulate general, those approved by the refugee review committee number more than 250 copies. The consulate has issued refugee certificates to 208 people. However, if they do not obtain refugee status, they will still be handled as usual. When the Anqing ship arrived in the Philippines a few days ago, 11 people were sent back to Quanzhou due to non-compliance with the procedures. However, the practice of paying an export certificate stamp tax of 5.2 pesos has been abolished. This method is based on the instructions of the Philippine Presidential Palace. From now on, overseas Chinese returning to China can be exempted from obtaining an export certificate. Those who have not obtained an export certificate when returning to their country do not need to pay a supplementary payment after returning to the Philippines.</p>
<h3>The Iron Current Theater Troupe Is About to Perform</h3>

<h3>The New Sports Ground of Jiefang Girls' Middle School Is Completed; Students Are Injected with Immunization Shots</h3>
<p>For the purpose of improving students' physical education, Jiefang Girls' Middle School, with a sea view, started construction after obtaining permission from the Hong Kong government to lease 5,000 feet of open space near the school. Most of the project is now nearing completion. The main entrance faces Zhengmi Road, opposite the school. The area inside the stadium is spacious, and the sports equipment is very complete. In addition, in order to ensure the safety of students due to the recent epidemic of cholera in Hong Kong, the school injected them with anti-cholera shots last Saturday.</p>
<h3>This Month's Criminal Cases Open for Trial; The High Court Sentences Nine Cases; Defendant in Fifty-Seven Cases, Can Be Called the "King of Pickpockets"</h3>
<p>There are eight criminal cases this month. Yesterday morning at 10:00, Judge McKeag and Associate Judge Lian Su of the High Court presided over the trial. Nine cases were sentenced, and the remaining cases were remanded because the defendants all pleaded not guilty. Then, jurors were summoned to jointly interrogate. The prosecutors were government lawyers Yiyi and Bao Liandi.</p>
<p>Pickpocketing and Drug Possession</p>
<p>There were five sentences passed yesterday morning, including (1) Huang Zhong, accused of pickpocketing Yu Yaokun on the road last month and stealing a wallet containing 70 Hong Kong dollars and 10 Vietnamese dollars.

When the court deliberated on the matter, it said that this kind of drug is more harmful to the Chinese people than Japanese planes. You knowingly committed the crime and cannot be forgiven, so you will be sentenced to three years of hard labor. (5) Zhong Zhenkun, accused of possessing two cut-off shotguns and sixteen bullets in Shau Kei Wan last month, was sentenced to three years of hard labor.</p>

<p>Learn in the Collective, Grow in the Collective; The Opening Ceremony of the Youth Tong Le Society Held Warmly at the North River Theater; Latte</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Learning and Growing in Collectivity - Youth Fellowship Inauguration Ceremony Held Vigorously at North River Theatre</h3>
<p>— Latter</p>
<p>Over a thousand young men and women, filled with spirited fervor, gathered cheerfully at the North River Theatre in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, on a clear and sunny morning yesterday to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Youth Fellowship.</p>
<p>The venue was filled with guests, and the stage was also filled with representatives from various societies. From the plaques displayed on the stage, sent by Morning Bell Society, Self-Strengthening Society, Foreign Affairs Workers; Chung Hwa Book Company, Military Society, Lianxing Typing Company, Huiyang Youth Association, Women's Federation Yixun Class, Sham Shui Po Hawker Ping An Hall, Du Qizhang, Yang Yueji and others, adorned with simple and beautiful anti-Japanese war slogans, one couldn't help but be reminded of how the Youth Fellowship itself had gained the love and sympathy of people from all walks of life, and earned the position it deserved in society.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Youth Fellowship had gone through a considerably long preparatory period. However, through the efforts of this group, full of fighting spirit, truth and justice, and the courage to roar at the motherland, they had already done many extraordinary things. In the past, they had sent thirty to forty members back to the motherland to serve in the war, distributed across the East River, West River, and North River regions. This was the glorious achievement of their mobilization work. They had also done their utmost in fundraising, whether in terms of spiritual reports, food, or material supplies; and had sent warm condolences to soldiers, wounded soldiers, and people. They had also taken their educational work very seriously, including current affairs seminars, women's discussion groups, choir, Mandarin classes, publishing wall newspapers, and children's groups. This was a part of their internal strengthening of education. Their external service work was also no less than ninety-six times, covering areas such as drama and singing. These were the many glorious achievements of the Youth Fellowship, and the fundamental reason why it had won the sympathy and applause of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The Youth Fellowship is gradually growing stronger and healthier, and it will not betray the eager expectations people have for it. Perhaps it still has many shortcomings and weaknesses that need to be overcome as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, the joyful and enthusiastic crowd eagerly watched the curtain being unveiled:</p>
<p>The chairman, with a lively and energetic face, explained the reasons for holding the meeting. Following this, a leader led the oath of national spiritual mobilization. At this moment, the people's voices announcing the oath rose loudly. The oath also tightened everyone's tense blood, making everyone from now on hold the torch of "national conscience" tightly to burn the souls of national traitors. After the oath, Mr. Zheng Shouren, the KMT representative stationed in Hong Kong, gave a speech. He encouraged the youth to strengthen unity and shatter the enemy's conspiracy of a quick victory through war or peace. These were very important topics. The speech by Mr. Du Qizhang, the honorary president of the Fellowship, also encouraged the youth to raise their national self-esteem and resolutely eliminate the dregs of traitors in the rear. Hitting out at the words and deeds of traitors, so as to coordinate with the progress of the current military and political situation. These were very valuable words. The representatives of other societies also delivered concise and powerful messages to strengthen the national united front, expressing the heartfelt voices that each should have. All of these speeches drew enthusiastic applause from the audience. From everyone's words and applause, it was clear that people's thoughts were concentrated, their will was concentrated, and their strength was concentrated. This would not be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>After the speeches, the Youth Fellowship's youth choir, both male and female, dressed in pure white clothes, sang patriotic songs under the direction of Mr. Liu Jia, lively like a flock of seagulls in the wind and waves. The clear, tragic, crisp, and melodious voices made people feel that this group of young men and women was even more lovable, and everyone showed joyful smiles.</p>
<p>After the singing, people hadn't yet gotten over the joyous emotions they had just enjoyed, and even more enjoyable recreational programs began to be presented:</p>
<p>The first act was a one-act play "Daughters of China". The plot was about a girl full of love and passion who would rather sacrifice her sweet love and end the life of her lover who was a traitor. The performance was quite intense, and the technical level of the actors was not bad. This could be clearly seen from the shouts and applause of the audience.</p>
<p>The second act was "Struggling on the Line of Life and Death", also a one-act play. The plot was about anti-pessimism. The technique of the performers was not bad either, but because there were some not-so-intense factors, it was inevitable that the audience was not very interested.</p>
<p>The third act was "Let Go of Our Grievances", also a one-act play. The plot was about a family who, because of the devastation caused by the enemy, abandoned their ten-year-old hatred for a soldier who killed their husband and father, and jointly raised the call for military-civilian cooperation, abandoning old grudges, and resisting violence. This was the most intense and outstanding performance, and the most exciting and inspiring act.</p>
<p>These three one-act plays could be considered some sincere gifts that the Youth Fellowship gave to the people. However, it was precisely from these gifts that people had a deeper understanding and a more genuine trust in the Fellowship's lively energy, its serious, and intense atmosphere.</p>
<p>After the plays, a group of clever and lively boys and girls from the Fellowship, also with voices like swallows, sang "China, China..." "Wandering Children... Arm Yourselves..." This aroused even more laughter and enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.</p>
<p>In this harmonious exchange, at around 2:15, everyone wiped the sweat from their foreheads with smiles and the meeting ended. Each person embarked on their way home, carrying unforgettable and wonderful impressions.</p>
<h3>Cargo Transport Congestion and Insufficient Supply – Hong Kong-Vietnam Shipping Rates Increase – Both Taikoo and Jardine Increase by Twenty Percent</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the economic center of our country has shifted to the southwest. The southwest has the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam transportation lines, which are currently the only transportation routes in our country. Among them, Haiphong, Vietnam, is particularly convenient. Therefore, since the function of Hong Kong as an entrepot has disappeared, the volume of goods transported from Hong Kong to Vietnam has increased significantly. Seeing the potential for profit, various shipping companies have successively increased the number of ships sailing between Hong Kong and Vietnam. It is estimated that more than ten ships have been added compared to before the fall of important cities, with an average of one ship traveling back and forth every day. However, there is still a situation where demand exceeds supply. Therefore, cargo transportation costs are rising daily. According to sources in Hong Kong's Vietnamese community, the shipping rates of Taikoo and Jardine's ships have uniformly increased by 20% since the first of this month. The original rate of six yuan and two and a half dimes per ton of general merchandise has now increased to seven yuan and five dimes. However, cargo transport has not decreased as a result, and is still extremely congested.</p>
<h3>Huiyang Youth Association Launches Comfort Campaign – Determines "July 7th" Commemoration Work</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Huiyang Youth Association recently established a Comfort Work Committee to carry out all comfort work. It is reported that it has been decided to start district-based competitions for soliciting donations of medicines, etc., on the 20th of this month. Regarding the Association's preparations for this year's "July 7th" anniversary, it plans to hold activities such as fasting and selling flowers to enrich the strength of the comfort work. At the same time, it will also prepare an exhibition, using Huiyang in the War of Resistance as the main material, scheduled to be held around "July 7th".</p>
<h3>Pang Jingzhou Talks About the Recent Situation of the Red Cross Society of China's Work</h3>
<p>Zhu Hengbi, Managing Director, and Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General, of the Red Cross Society of China, had left Hong Kong for two months to inspect the Society's relief work, traveling through the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan. They recently returned to Hong Kong and resumed their duties. Yesterday, the reporter made a special visit, and Mr. Pang revealed that the Society's current work can be roughly divided into two major parts: one is the care of wounded soldiers, which is entirely handled by Lin Kesheng. The headquarters is located at Geyunguan, six miles outside Guiyang City. There are a total of four brigade headquarters, located in the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. The locations where the teams are distributed extend east to Jinhua, south to Shaoguan, northwest to a certain county in southern Shanxi, and Fushi in Shaanxi. Their duties include assisting military hospitals with treatment, rescue, transportation, epidemic prevention, injections, and disinfection. Most of the teaching staff of the health personnel training classes established by the Military Affairs, Political Affairs, and Internal Affairs departments are also personnel of the Red Cross Society. The second is civil relief, which focuses on emergency care during air raids in major cities. Offices have been established in Chongqing and Kunming, either participating in joint offices in those locations or taking on the responsibility independently. Chongqing has been subjected to repeated air raids in recent days, and the Society's participation in rescue efforts has been very effective. The Society is responsible for the cleanliness and inspection of air raid shelters in Chongqing and Kunming. In places such as Guizhou and Guangxi, the Society has medical teams stationed there, which can be mobilized at any time. Mr. Pang also said that within the next few days, a comprehensive report on the entire work of the Red Cross Society since the War of Resistance, including all accounting, will be drafted into a special document and published in Hong Kong newspapers.</p>
<h3>Clever Strategy of Police Detectives – Transport Vehicles Used as Prison Vans – Large-Scale Arrest of Unlicensed Hawkers – Police Detectives Change Clothes, Disguise Themselves and Move Out – Hawkers Arrested Before They Could React</h3>
<p>Unlicensed hawkers originally violate police laws. However, due to the difficulty of making a living, some hawkers risk their lives to earn a living, gathering in Cochrane Street and Gage Street in Central, Tung Street and Sai Street in Sheung Wan, and Chung Ching Street and Second and Third Streets in Sai Ying Pun, Hennessy Road and Tai Dao East Shek Wing Chek Street in Wan Chai, etc., morning and evening markets, arranged like long snakes, are very lively, almost more prosperous than formal merchants in the market. The reason is that they sell on the streets without the need for rent or license fees, and the selling price is cheaper than in the market. Therefore, more and more people are flocking to them, and more and more people are doing this business. The police authorities have previously dispatched prison vans to carry out large-scale arrests of these unlicensed hawkers. However, the hawkers are extremely cunning. As soon as they see the police or prison vans arriving, they flee in droves. After the police leave, they return to their stalls. Driven by life, they cannot but struggle with the environment in panic and movement. The inspectors are responsible for maintaining traffic and tidying up the city, and constantly try to clean up these hawkers. However, the arresters arrest, and the hawkers remain undiminished. The authorities have not yet found a fundamental solution to the problem of unlicensed hawkers. The Hong Kong and Kowloon magistrates' courts interrogate unknown numbers of unlicensed hawkers every day. The result is nothing more than fines. Because there are too many offenders, the judges can only impose penalties according to regulations. After these people are released after being fined, they resume selling on the streets. Therefore, the hawker problem cannot be eliminated unless the government finds a way to solve it thoroughly. Recently, the police, in view of the difficulty of arresting hawkers who evade arrest, implemented disguised action. Yesterday, on Sunday afternoon at around 3:00 p.m., a large number of police detectives were dispatched, who first changed their clothes and patrolled around the Central Market. Then, a transport vehicle was dispatched, covered with a Red Cross flag to conceal the hawkers' eyes and ears, so as to prevent them from fleeing in advance. The hawkers in the Gage Street and Cochrane Street area were in the midst of vigorous business at this time. At first, they did not know that the transport vehicle covered with the Red Cross flag was a prison van, and they were arrested one by one. The male and female hawkers selling vegetables who were arrested on the spot numbered seventy or eighty. Those who took the opportunity to flee were eventually intercepted by the plainclothes police detectives and escorted to the prison van.</p>

<p>Special report from this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Appearing with a New Look, Pioneering a New Path for Illustrated Magazines - Recommending the "Shen Bao Pictorial", Inaugural Issue Published Today</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Two or three months ago, precious photographs from all directions were delivered to the office of Mr. Zhang Zhengyu, the reprint editor of this newspaper, one by one by the postman. Many times, even when it was late at night, Mr. Zhang was still diligently buried in editing.</p>
<p>Publishing a book or magazine? Mr. Zhang told the reporter:</p>
<p>"Photographs are more agile and profound than words. Especially for the vast overseas Chinese and international friends, it is easy to see from the photos the suffering and new life of China in the War of Resistance. These vivid and concrete facts are not exaggerated, nor are they emphasized. They are a powerful weapon for comforting overseas Chinese, inspiring overseas Chinese, and expanding international publicity."</p>
<p>"At present, domestic transportation is inconvenient, and there is a lack of material conditions. Publishing a healthy and great pictorial is not an easy task. We promote cultural undertakings in Hong Kong's news work, so we must shoulder this great and inescapable task."</p>
<p>"What are the characteristics of our pictorial?" Mr. Zhang told the reporter very proudly:</p>
<p>"Abandon the traditional concept of beautiful women on the cover, and promote a bold and broad editorial format. There is no..."</p>
<p>This book has finally met the readers today after arduous editing and printing.</p>
<p>The paper is eight-open size number two printing paper, and the texture is very fine. Printed in photogravure, it is very clear and exquisitely bound. Twenty pages or forty pages, it is a brand new and substantial new pictorial. The cost of the content determines that the selling price of each copy cannot be less than forty cents.</p>
<p>The cover is exquisitely printed with a five-color rubber plate featuring a portrait of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. Although his eyebrows are white and his spirit is vigorous, he symbolizes the good omen of the country. Just as the inaugural statement says: "Shen Bao is an old newspaper, but the staff always wants to seek innovation... Mr. Ma Xiangbo has been enthusiastic about the revolution since he was young, and he has not changed to this day... Therefore, this newspaper uses the recent photograph of Mr. Ma as the cover of our pictorial, which is to take Mr. Ma's usual style as the motto of this magazine, to encourage each other, and to warn each other."</p>
<p>Open the cover, and the first picture is a flame; a burning flame, a great flame. The flame symbolizes the light of the nation, and the flame symbolizes the vitality of the nation. Going further, each page has a center. "Turning the Day of National Humiliation in May into a Day of Never Forgetting National Humiliation" contains the grand scene of the torch parade in Chongqing. The solemn posture of Chairman Jiang during his speech. The following page, "National Covenant Oath of the United People," makes people feel infinitely gratified and infinitely inspired.</p>
<p>The "Blood Account" page includes the ruins of the Nine-One-Eight Incident, which are the tragic scenes after Chongqing was bombed. This hatred, this resentment.</p>
<p>"The Sound of Horns Moves the North Wind, the Sword Energy Charges the Southern Dipper" shows Hunan, Guizhou, Central Hubei, Northern Shaanxi, Northern Jiangsu, Eastern Anhui... in the great ranks of coordinating the War of Resistance. As the saying goes, "Dare to say that today's East Asia is still the mountains and rivers of China!" The soldiers on the "Jin-Yu Line" are ready to face the enemy, which makes people stand in awe. The "New Army Waiting for Orders" and "Lofty Ambitions Reach the Galaxy, Heroic Spirit Pervades the Heavens" have achievements in battlefields, and there are valiant air force soldiers. It tells us: China is advancing on the road to modern countries, and our heroic air force soldiers are the clouds of the nation.</p>
<p>"The Central Figures in the European Situation in Confrontation" and "Illustrated Explanation of European Affairs" are a clear and concise analysis of the current situation. "A New Theory of War" is a rare thesis, with precise statistical figures and rare illustrations.</p>
<p>The modern Chinese cartoon exhibition held in Hong Kong a few days ago also selected twelve representative works to form an essential page, showing the contribution of advanced painters in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>"The Base of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance - Gansu" makes people admire the greatness of the motherland. The "Pilgrimage to Yan'an" page, including eight illustrations, makes people look up to it and feel excited and optimistic about the future of New China. Ding Ling's healthy and determined portrait fully demonstrates the outstanding sons and daughters of the nation forged from the great era, and their spirit is a good example for young friends.</p>
<p>There are also: the panorama of the "Golden Soup of Bashu", Sichuan; the powerful and hot fourteen scenes of "Human Power"; the essence pictures of the Chinese Travel Service's, Phoenix City's "sensational" "Huang Hua Gang Seventy-Two Martyrs" play, the celebration of "Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Anniversary," and the innocent and lively little masters of "Nurturing to Support the Foundation of the Nation," all of which are the true portrayal of China in hard struggle, and a new China.</p>
<p>The editor, Mr. Zhang, said that he will strive to enrich the book and hopes that readers will give more criticism and suggestions and contributions, so that the book will become an advanced publication that bears the great task of the era.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Fishing Boats肆 Slaughtered by Japanese Warships – Estimated Losses Reach 20 Million – Over a Thousand Fishing Boats Burned, More Than Ten Thousand Victims – Ignorant Fishermen in Sanmen Bay Actually Attached to Japanese</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese warships illegally blockaded our coast in September of the previous year, incidents of Hong Kong fishing boats being attacked by Japanese warships in Hong Kong and overseas have been happening almost every day. Initially, a number of fishing boats accepted the government's advice and temporarily stopped going out to sea. However, as time passed, making a living became a real problem, so they ventured out to sea again at the risk of their lives, putting life and death out of their minds. If they encountered Japanese warships, they tried to escape. If they were captured, they resisted stubbornly, and most of them made heroic sacrifices, creating an unprecedented record of shipowners suffering.</p>
<p>Recent Statistics on Fishing Boat Casualties</p>
<p>Every time fishermen encounter difficulties at sea, the survivors report to the Overseas Chinese Fishermen's Association in Hong Kong. Over the past year, the Fishermen's Association has gathered reports from all parties and reported the true situation of fishermen's suffering to the ancestral country's government authorities. According to the recent statistical report released by the Association, from September of the previous year to the end of November of last year, a total of 628 Hong Kong fishing boats were burned by Japanese warships in Hong Kong and overseas, with 10,092 fishermen killed. From January to the end of May of this year, 16 fishing boats were burned and 34 went missing in five months. On average, 1,205 fishermen were killed. From September of the previous year to the end of May of this year, a total of 644 fishing boats were burned and 34 went missing in 21 months, with a total of 11,342 fishermen killed. The above figures are only based on statistics from fishermen's reports. Others who have not reported to the Association are not included. It is estimated that the total number of Hong Kong fishing boats burned and missing in the past 21 months is over 1,000, with an estimated financial loss of as much as 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>肆 Japanese Warships Acted Rampantly in Three Periods</p>
<p>According to reports, Japanese warships' oppression of fishermen can be roughly divided into three periods: initially, intimidation, burning fishing boats whenever they encountered them operating overseas; the second period was to implement a policy of appeasement, luring fishermen with benefits; and the most recent was to implement a policy of robbery. Therefore, in the past five months, there have been many more Hong Kong fishing boats missing. Both the missing people and boats have been captured. Only those who were at sea with them returned to Hong Kong to report. In addition to robbing property, fishermen's children are also the target of these people. It has been found that there are an average of six or seven children on each fishing boat. After the Japanese soldiers capture them, they rush them back to Japan to instill in them slave education, in order to replenish the number of young men in their country. This method is extremely vicious.</p>
<p>Ignorant Fishermen Lured to Attach Themselves to the Japanese</p>
<p>What is even more heartbreaking is that some ignorant fishermen have been lured to attach themselves to the Japanese. Near Sanmen Bay, a portion of the fishermen have been bought over by the Japanese. According to fishermen who returned to Hong Kong from Sanmen Bay, some fishermen there have been lured by Japanese benefits and have become traitors, forming a group to transport grain for the Japanese and are protected by Japanese warships to fish along the coast. When Hong Kong fishing boats sail to that area, they are attacked by Japanese warships. Many of the fishing boats that Japanese warships have robbed in Hong Kong and overseas in the past are also parked there. After the Fishermen's Association was informed, in order to prevent ignorant fishermen from being attracted and attached to the Japanese, it actively advised fishermen to be careful when going out to sea to fish, and not to sail near Sanmen Bay to avoid misfortune. Most fishermen also believe that fishing there is too dangerous and do not dare to sail there, instead fishing in places such as Lufeng, Jiazih, Jieshi, Pinghai, and Aotou to avoid looting by Japanese warships.</p>
<p>Authorities Improve Fishermen's Lives</p>
<p>The reason why fishermen attach themselves to the Japanese is due to the difficulties of making a living, which makes them susceptible to Japanese enticements. Recognizing this, the domestic military and political authorities have taken steps to improve the lives of fishermen. Recently, the Commander of the ×th War Zone, in order to investigate the living conditions of residents along the coast of Guangdong and improve them, organized a Guangdong East Sea Area Fishery Investigation Team and sent them to various coastal areas for inspection. The team recently arrived in Hong Kong and transferred to Bao'an. During its stay in Hong Kong, it investigated everything with the Overseas Chinese Fishermen's Association, which provided a great deal of reference information on the living conditions of fishermen. It also reported in detail the various forms of extortion by fishery and salt officials towards fishermen, requesting the authorities to thoroughly improve the situation in order to solve the fishermen's livelihood. The Fishermen's Association has also prepared a petition and submitted it to the authorities in writing, hoping that ways can be found to improve the situation.</p>

<h3>Tam Sung's Loyalty and Bravery Commendable – Police Superintendent Forwards Request for Recognition to English Governor – Donation Collection for Surviving Family Ends Today</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, a roadside robbery occurred on Lee Yuen Street East in Central. Chinese Detectives Tam Sung and Yuen Man bravely pursued and captured the perpetrators, killing one and arresting another. Yuen Man also died in the line of duty. Lo Suk-ho, a representative of the Chinese community, greatly admired the detectives' loyalty and bravery and visited Acting Police Superintendent Peter, along with Chinese representatives Lo Man Kam, Chow Chun Nin, and Tam Ah-sheh, to praise Tam Detective's loyalty and bravery and requested the Police Superintendent to grant an award. Peter thanked Sir Lo for his intentions and promised to forward the case to the authorities for verification and conferment. As for Chinese Detective Yuen Man, who died in the line of duty, his death was deeply mourned by people from all walks of life. Chinese representatives in Hong Kong launched a fundraising campaign to provide relief to Yuen's surviving family. People from all walks of life donated generously. As of yesterday, more than 2,000 yuan has been collected, and the campaign will be announced to end today.</p>

<h3>Diocesan Boys' School Student Strike - Resolution Expected Today</h3>
<p>The authorities of Diocesan Boys' School in Ho Man Tin, Kowloon, recently appointed a Japanese student named Peng as the student body president. The Chinese students of the school, believing that his reputation did not meet public expectations and fearing that it would affect the patriotic movement, requested the school authorities to appoint someone else, but their request was not met. More than a hundred Chinese students have successively left the school. The school principal, Mr. Corbin, has tried to explain the misunderstanding to the community and the students of the school, expressing absolute sympathy for China's resistance to Japan. At the same time, he extended the deadline for the striking students to return to school to the 19th. Now that the deadline has passed, many of the striking students have not returned to school to attend classes. Both sides are taking extreme measures, which is not a good idea. Seeing this, the Hong Kong Student Relief Association specially appointed its director, Li Zhengyao, to mediate the matter. Mr. Li immediately met with the student representatives, listened to everything, and then visited Mr. Ho Minghua and Mr. Luo Xuhui, the chairman and vice-chairman of the school's board of directors, respectively, conveying the students' opinions and requesting Mr. Ho and Mr. Luo to discuss with the school principal and other school directors to first allow the more than 20 students of the second grade who left the school to return to school on Saturday (24th) to participate in the Junior Meeting of the Director of Education, and secondly, that the student body president, Peng, was originally only a temporary acting appointment until the expiration of his acting term on the 24th, and then request the school authorities to appoint someone else according to regulations. It is heard that the result of the negotiation was very satisfactory, and the opinions of both sides are very close. Bishop Ho Minghua has expressed to the representatives of the Student Relief Association that he hopes that the students who left the school can resume classes on Tuesday and that everything else will have a satisfactory solution. According to reliable sources, the students who left the school will all resume classes today, and a solution will be negotiated today.</p>

<p>(Changsha Quick News) According to a phone call from the front line, Deng Longguang's troops have been arriving at the front line one after another. Our troops are gathering in Duruan Mulang Jinggen Old Village on the Xinhui Road, Daze Niuwan Sanjiang Luzhou on the Xinkai Road, and along the Jiangmen-Foshan Highway. Morale is high, and strength is abundant. Some senior officers and the newly appointed Commander of the Fifth District Guerrilla, Ma Shaoping, and others have personally arrived at the front line on the 15th to supervise the battle. Currently, the vanguard has continued to arrive in the area of Daxiaomeishan. There has been contact in recent days. After a long period of silence, the Jiangmen and Xinhui War is about to begin.</p>
<p>Minor Battles in Recent Days - Some Gains</p>
<p>It has been found that since arriving at the front line, our troops have had contact with the [Japanese] in recent days. The battle situation is as follows: (1) Yang Regiment's Battalion X dispatched a platoon leader on the afternoon of the 15th around 2:00 pm, leading dozens of guerrillas to attack the [Japanese] near Jiangmen. At around 3:00 pm, they arrived at Xiangshan in Duruan and discovered several hundred [Japanese]. Our troops immediately dispersed and launched a calm attack. In a panic, the [Japanese] actually drove dozens of water buffalo to cover their advance. Our troops concentrated their firepower and fired intensively. The [Japanese] finally collapsed and fled. In this battle, more than 20 [Japanese] were killed and more than water buffalo were shot. (2) Yesterday, a [Japanese] tank carrying more than 30 [Japanese] soldiers sneaked into the area to conduct activities. They were discovered by a certain unit of the Yang Regiment, who immediately threw grenades at the [Japanese], killing more than 10 [Japanese]. The [Japanese] fled in panic. (3) Liao Regiment's Battalion X began to participate in guerrilla warfare in the Daxiaomeishan area, starting the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they had advanced behind the [Japanese], and they were very active. They were constantly attacking the [Japanese] and had some gains. (4) In the Jiangmen and Xinhui front line and Shuikou area, [Japanese] planes have flown over to reconnoiter and spread fallacious leaflets in the past two days, but have not dropped bombs.</p>
<h3>[Japanese] Planes Bombing Dongjiang - Population Dispersed in Huiyang</h3>
<p>(Huizhou Correspondence) The Huiyang County authorities received a secret report that the [Japanese] are planning to bomb various cities and towns in Guangdong in the shortest possible time. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, County Magistrate Liu Binggang convened a meeting of representatives from all walks of life on the 14th. Eighty-two representatives attended and made thorough decisions on the evacuation of the population. Also, at 11:00 am on the 16th, seven [Japanese] planes flew separately to Boluo, Heyuan, Zijin, Hai , and Mu and wantonly bombed these places. As for the losses of population and materials, the situation is not yet clear because the telephone poles along the way have been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Our Troops on the Northern Line - Launch a Major Victory - Fierce Fighting North of Taipingchang</h3>
<p>(Beijiang Quick News) According to military news from the front line, the fighting in Conghua has always been favorable to us. Since the [Japanese] reinforcements, they have been acting aggressively in recent days. In order to gain the initiative, Ye Zhao, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the [Chinese] Group Army, issued an order on the 14th for a certain elite unit to launch a surprise attack on the [Japanese] while they were unprepared. Our troops had been conserving their energy and morale was high. Upon hearing the order to attack, they immediately advanced bravely. That afternoon, they forced their way to the north of Taipingchang and made contact with the [Japanese]. The [Japanese] army used intense artillery fire to prevent our troops from advancing. By evening, they were still at a stalemate, but the highlands in the northwest of Taipingchang were all in our troops' hands. The [Japanese] were under control. At around 1:00 am that night, Xie Regiment dispatched a rapid advance team, together with Liang's guerrilla unit, to sneak across Meixi to the right of Taipingchang and break into Shuinantou, resulting in a fierce battle. Our troops had the advantage of fighting in the dark and heavily surrounded the [Japanese] battalion at Shigong Temple, breaking through the [Japanese] headquarters at Fuxiang Pawnshop. After about two hours of fierce fighting, our troops, with their goals achieved, immediately withdrew. The results of this battle, because it was in the dark, the number of [Japanese] killed is unknown, but a large number of guns, ammunition, helmets, and flags were seized.</p>

<h3>Middle School Entrance Examinations This Year - Suspended - Still Conducted by Each School Itself</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Quick News) The Department of Education believes that because the province is affected by the war, the middle school graduation examinations for this year will still be temporarily suspended and should be conducted by each school itself.

<h3>Lion Rock [Japanese] Warehouse - Collapses and Explodes - Gasoline Burns, Causing Great Loss</h3>
<p>(Panyu Quick News) Lianhua Mountain on the west coast of Shizi Yang is the second gateway to the Pearl River. Since the [Japanese] army occupied Humen, they have set up ordnance warehouses in Lianhua Rock and Lion Rock on the mountain, storing a large amount of ordnance, ammunition, and supplies. However, in recent days, there has been continuous heavy rain and mountain torrents, which on the 14th washed away the large stone on Lion Rock, which was more than five zhang square. The gasoline stored in the rock was spilled at once, causing a fire, and the bombs in the rock also exploded at the same time. The sound of the explosion shook the mountains and valleys. Two [Japanese] warships anchored on the east coast of Shizi Yang saw the smoke rising from the mountain and thought that the [Japanese] soldiers there had been surrounded and burned to death by our guerrillas. They launched consecutive artillery fire to bombard the area. The [Japanese] soldiers guarding Yunhua Rock behind the mountain suddenly heard dense artillery fire and also mistakenly thought that they were being attacked by our guerrillas. They immediately sent a team to reinforce them. When they arrived, they realized that the Lion Rock warehouse had exploded. However, because the fire was extremely fierce, they let it burn. It is estimated that the rock contained more than 600 cans of gasoline, more than 200 boxes of bombs, and countless machine gun bullets. All of them were reduced to ashes, causing extremely heavy losses. It is said that the fire started at 8:00 am that day and was not extinguished until 3:00 pm the next day (15th).</p>

<h3>A Discussion from Ancient Greece - The Various Aspects of the Olympic Games</h3>
<p>- Ding Lao</p>
<p>- A More Valuable History of Sports -</p>
<p>The Decline of the Olympic Games - Greek sports had a tendency to decline. Some philosophers, such as Xenohhanosplaton, had criticisms, but they were useless. Later, sports became professionalized and specialized, so although the athletes' bodies were far developed, they had no moral cultivation. They forgot the meaning of representing their countries and their religious beliefs in order to win prizes for themselves. At the 96th athletic competition, the Elio judges were suspected of colluding because the athletes from their city won. At the 97th competition, the judges were bribed, and there was an event of unfair judgment.</p>
<p>Later, Rome conquered Greece. Although they still retained the custom of athletic competitions, Roman youth were mostly preparing to become politicians and political commentators. They were always in the position of observing and criticizing the success or failure of athletic competitions and were unwilling to fail and be criticized. Since the upper class was unwilling to participate, it was bound to fall into the hands of wandering performers. These people used sports as a profession, and the victory or defeat in sports had a direct impact on their lives, so they often used improper means to achieve victory. Because they only sought victory, they disregarded their physical health and even became disabled invalids as a result. However, the war-loving Romans needed sports to be as bloody as the battlefield in order to stimulate their senses and satisfy their pleasure. Therefore, in the large theater that could accommodate 80,000 people, they watched wild beasts fight. Local officials considered it a credit to their duty to raise wild beasts. The stench of blood was dissipated by sprinkling grape wine. The Romans were not satisfied with the sensory stimulation of animals fighting each other. They forced criminals sentenced to death to fight beasts. Their psychology was that they did not want people to kill beasts, but they wanted beasts to eat people. Later, they changed to criminals fighting each other with real knives. If one of the two was injured, the victor would ask the crowd for punishment. If the crowd pointed upwards, they would be spared; if they pointed downwards, they would be killed. They took pleasure in watching their dying misery. After they died, they were immediately carried out of the arena for fear of hindering the next fight. Even the children of Rome found this dark and miserable thing pleasurable. No wonder historians wrote in the history of the decline of Rome that the decline of sports was the only reason for the fall of Rome. The Romans regarded war as a business, so the celebrations of each victory were always cyclical. Some ambitious people, in order to cater to the public's opinion, made the youth perform practical combat-like sports. This kind of sport was later added to the practice of land warfare with 500 soldiers and 20 elephants, and the practice of naval warfare with the creation of lakes. They did not care even if there were deaths or injuries. When the Romans conquered Greece, they did not dare to desecrate the treasures of the Greek temples for fear of offending the gods. Later, some people gradually took them to decorate their homes. When Emperor Nero came to power, he transported more than a thousand treasures and was jealous of the marble statues of the winners, ordering people to destroy them. That is why the remnants and fragments of sculptures and stone statues, which are now considered to be rare treasures in art museums around the world, exist. He was opposed to the worship of Greek culture by his ancestors, but he himself wanted to be the winner of the athletic games. He specially opened the Olympic Games again and participated in the chariot race. He fell out of the chariot as soon as he entered the arena and used a lot of bribes to finally win. He also returned in triumph according to the Greek ceremony, wearing purple clothes, riding a white horse, and holding a laurel wreath in his right hand, proudly ordering the citizens to cheer and congratulate him on his victory. To sum up, the reasons for the decline of ancient sports are: first, the Roman's practical character; second, the Roman's need for strong sensory stimulation; third, Emperor Nero's nonsense; and fourth, the rise of Christianity. Among them, the fourth reason was the most fatal blow to the decline of ancient sports. At that time, the Roman class system was very strict. The upper class was chaotic and licentious, and the majority of the lower class could not bear the suffering of the world and hoped to go to heaven early and be willing to be martyred. Later, the doctrines gradually became popular, and people from the upper class began to believe in them. In 394 AD, Emperor Thedofsus made it the state religion and ordered that those who did not believe in the police religion would be punished. He also considered the Olympic Games to be a relic of pagans and resolutely banned them. The sacred games, which lasted for 1,170 years from 776 BC to 394 AD, came to an end. Later, the temples were destroyed by a major earthquake, and the arena was buried by floods. It was not until 1875 that it was excavated by the Germans and French. (8)</p>
