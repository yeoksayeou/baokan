<p>社評</p>
<h3>論二期抗戰宣傳問題</h3>
<p>全面抗戰二十閱月於茲，軍事政治形勢已有顯著變化，×人及漢奸旣在積極發動其新的陰謀步驟，我國戰略政治及整個國際形勢亦有重大進步，如何向全國民衆及國際人士宣明此種新的形勢？如何指示國人及國際人士當前所處地位及其緊急任務？是民運和宣傳工作人員及輿論界教育界當前最緊急最重大的工作。中央現已決定自三月六日至十二日舉行第二期抗戰第一次宣傳週，並且明白規定其辦法為：（一）全國各地在宣傳週內一律舉行宣傳大會，（二）舉行特別廣播演講，（三）各報紙刊物發行特刊，（四）各地組織宣傳隊，發分鄉村宣傳，（五）各學校舉行講演曾，（六）各地電影戲劇等娛樂塲舉行特別宣傳。此外並準備大批宣傳品，分送戰地散發。關於宣傳內容，並曾由電委會政治部第三廳製定第二期抗戰宣傳綱要一文。大致以蔣委員長駁斥近衛荒謬聲明的演詞及國民黨五中全會開會詞為根據，作為第二期抗戰宣傳的基本原則。我們輿論界對於中央此舉，應該立刻表示熱烈的擁護與忠誠的執行。但為獲得應有的成果起見，我們還願敬獻所知，以備輿論界教育界及一切宣傳工作人員作參玫。</p>
<p>關於二期抗戰宣傳問題，主要的應該是下面兩個問題，第一是如何指示第二期抗戰新形勢與全民族新任務的問題，第二是如何順利完成二期抗戰宣傳任務問題。二期抗戰是急劇轉變×優我劣形勢的時期，是積極粉碎×之進攻準備我之反攻的時期，我們在這一時期的主要任務，就在如何高度發揚民族自尊心與自信心，克服悲觀失望情緒，反對妥協投降主張，厲行除奸運動，堅持國結抗戰，爭取最後勝利；就在如何進行宣傳說服的工作，達到全國人民誠心誠意擁護政府擁護領袖，擁護國共合作全國團結，反對分裂企圖及任何漢奸傀儡組織；就在如何擴大民衆運動，發展民衆團體，團結國內漢滿蒙囘藏苗猺夷各民族，動員及集中廣大民衆的有生及無生力量，積極參加抗戰建國工作；就在如何提高各綫正面的主力軍戰鬥力量，擴大發展×人後方的游擊戰爭，迅速建設新軍準備反攻力量，以達到粉碎×人進攻推進我軍反攻；就在加緊推動國內政治的進步，改善各級政治機構，實施民主政治，執行戰時財政經濟政策，實行必要的民生改善，密切政府軍隊與民衆的聯系，發揮抗日政權的最大效能；就在加緊發展日本國內台灣朝鮮及全世界的反法西斯反侵略的統一戰綫，爭取我國抗戰建國更多的外援。現在全面戰局與×我實况及國際形勢，均在證明抗戰已經轉向於我有利的第二階段，我們更應充分官傳目前階段中華兒女急應祖負的此種任務。</p>
<p>為了要使全體中華兒女一致深切認淸並英勇堅决地担負起上述各項緊急任務起見，中央已經决定擴大二期抗戰宣傳，並且規定第一次宣傳週的目體辦法。我們為要順利完成二期抗戰宣傳的任務，除了應該遵照中央規定的具體辦法之外，覺得還應認眞切實注意以下各點：</p>
<p>第一，要堅决與嚴厲的反對違反團結抗戰的言論行動：抗戰新形勢的主要特徵是戰爭長期性的確定，是×人不堪支持長期戰爭與我國加緊團結堅持長期抗戰必獲勝利的確定，因此×人的新戟略便特別注重於破壞我國團結，破壞長期抗戰。自從在精衛　　　　以後，國內雖已無人敢有違反抗戰國策的言論行動，但是在各種掩蔽之下繼續施展其漢奸技倆，散播反共停戰降日等等毒菌的，亦仍未曾激底肅淸，而在國外及其他特殊區域，則親日漢奸份子，在其主子大量津貼與統一指揮之下，更加肆無忌憚，發揮『和平，反共，親日『，的論調，實施金錢賄買恐怖脅逼的技倆，至於擁護抗戰反對×奸的輿論宣傳，則以顧慮所在國家的「中立」態度，反而不能暢所欲言。致使×奸恣意橫行，這是當前非常嚴重的事態，必須集中輿論界的力量，號召國際正義和平人士，協助中央政府，予以澈底的打擊。</p>
<p>第二，要加緊建立，鞏固，及發展國內與海外輿論界教育界的抗日統一戰綫，在中央政府統一的領導之下，推進一切宣傳動員計劃。用統一戰綫的力量，協助府政，去澈底肅淸潛伏國內的親日漢奸主和份子，去嚴厲打擊招瑤國際的「反共，和平，親日」的言論行動，加緊動員國內國外一切力量到抗日統一戰綫上來，為支持抗戰建國爭取最後勝利而服務。</p>
<p>第三，要積極推進國民外交運動，擴大國際宣傅，盡一切的力量，用適當的方法，一面發動與發展侵略國內部反法西斯反侵略戰的人民戰綫，一面統一與擴大各國及台鮮偽滿反法西斯反侵略的人民的團結，用這二方面的努力，來推進民主和平各國對於法西斯侵略者的實力制裁，及爭取各國對於我國抗戰建國事業更大的同情援助。</p>
<p>最後也最重要的，當然還要鞏穩固宣傳工作的基礎，就是必須盡一切力量加速政治進步，鞏固全國團結，動員全民力量，堅持抗戰到底，因為祗有這些事實才能保證抗戰宣傳的順利成功。也祗有這些事實才能粉碎×奸一切虛偽宣傳和陰謀毒計特殊環境下的</p>
<p>輿論界教育界、在此中央政府擴大抗戰宣傳運動之時，應該更加痛感情勢的嚴重與本身責任的艱鉅！當此國族命運轉捩關頭，×奸「和平」邪說橫流之際，風雨同舟，尤應羣策羣力，共同奮勉。</p>
<h3>華僑在安南</h3>
<p>— 沅雲</p>
<p>安南僑華貿易的今昔觀</p>
<p>安南華僑的黃金時代已經為了　日黃花的陳迹。年紀老大的華僑常常追憶過去貿易的煊　，嘆惜今日商業的凋零。五六十年前，安南的商港不在海防，西　而在南淀一帶。中國人秉承民族的冒險心與進取意志，由閩　海岸，着半舊的大帆給，漂流幾個月，才到得越南，那些在狂風巨　中矢事喪生的只好各安天命，至于僥倖一帆風順或千艱萬雜到得目的地的，便是他們發財十拿九穩的機會。那時候的中國人被稱爲唐朝阿　，中國客人和貨物一到埠不必，僱擔客，做廣告，馬上便有許多人爭先恐後來兜買。做生意的時候，安南人只好站在門口，屏聲息氣的　候唐朝阿叔的開價，假使價錢太貴，居奇太甚，他們也不敢反唇相訊，討價還價，只能低聲下氣請水「阿叔」開恩，賞碗飯吃，不至折本賠貨。每次帆船到埠之後，總有幾個月生意好做，土人要辦貨，除了向它要之外，別無方法，故此一本十利倒是操必勝之券的。到了後來，海禁漸開，中國人的生意使受了些打擊，但因歷史及信用的關係，還占着上風。迄　瓊山之戰，法人正式占領安南，中國人的貿易仍舊有它的特權。海關設立之時，華僑的貨運不必報關，不必檢查，只要一紙貨單，交給海關，納多少稅所算了事。沂年以來，越南對于華僑的商業××。可謂無微不至，華僑的商業，以粵閩為主，做的是五金，茶　，皮革，花邊，酒米，炮竹，銀簿，飲食，瓷器，古玩，等生意。越法當局一方面用關稅壁壘的政策限制華貨的入口，另外一方面極力鼓勵安南自給自足，自營商業，在過去，安南的商業多由女人主持，場面不大，大半是向華商批發零沽，自從越法常局普及實行拚昔拉丁文字以來，安南人很容易的便接受了文字的技能，漢字日見淘汰，簿記帳目均用拚音文字登記，同時，安南人受了小學教育之後，便閑　在家，無事可做，過去視經商為低微的職業底觀念亦漸次消除，因此，安南人的商業在政府保護，新法經營之下，居然浸浸然有自人一較雌雄之勞，在安南的華僑又多墨守舊法，貨式數十年如一日，不思改良，華僑之間，因為生意不景氛，互相傾軋之事屢見，他們只曉得近年來商業的衰落。而不衰知落的原因在於實易方法的守舊和貨品之不進步，所以除了自怨自艾縮小規樓之外，同案相殘，個別競爭成為他們唯一的對策，　說在河內，酒業的華商，因為自行鬥爭之故，連一個酒瓶的　餘郡掙不到，其困頓的情形可想而知，河內的廣東街五年前十分之八為華僑開設，到了現在，華人開設的還不到十分之三，　　海防的藥人街及東京街，情况亦復相似，贏利的生意，現在是旅館和飲食店，不用說掙的還是中國人的錢，這是抗戰年餘來的事，不在話下。</p>
<p>再說安南的工商業，二十年來已有了長足的進步。凡可以增加土人生產的方法，法國無不盡力扶植，越南各農村，常見有洗人騎電單車到來傳授各種增加農產品的方法，農家副業如養蠶，紡織，牧畜等，經常有法人到各處　導，東法大學的各研究所，也做了不少的生　指導工作，過去華僑專利的商品，如茶酒瓷器炮竹等，現安南人皆能目製，市塲上常見此等自製品的踪跡，大凡每一商品，安南人都能目己生產之後，該商品的關稅便立刻提高，以遏止外來品入口，華僑商業的衰落，卽此一端便為致命的主因在河內，每三年舉行全越商業工業品傳覽會一次，徵集各即自製產物，羅列各室，所有建築、均由政府供給，所費不貲，第十四次傳覽會，於一九三八年十一月開幕，內容豐富，紙，米，酒，茶，布，絲，以至鑛產，藥材等，應有盡有，會中尚有魚產十餘缸，說明為雲　府出品，現正在移殖研究中，其意味之深長、政策之週密，令人不寒而慄，所幸華僑貿易之歷史與信用尚為法人及安南所贊仰，市場貿易，　帮批發為法人所操持，轉運批發，華僑尚有餘潤可沾，華僑與安南人感情素洽，抗戰以來，中法邦交和睦，反映在商業上自亦有不少的方便。法國人嘗說過：「無論如何，中國人總比日本人好些，來一個日本人，我們便得用一個密探對付他，來幾個中國人，我們至少可以放心讓他們住下去。』因此，華僑的商業雖然較前減色，但能够掙扎得住，維持飽和狀態，也算是不容易的了。</p>
<p>安南的華僑教育</p>
<p>河內和海防兩地的華僑教育，從數量方面說，入學的兒童，海防在二千人以上，河內在千五百人以上，約佔學齡兒童十分之七以上，以與與內相比較，不可不謂相當普及，學校方面，海防有華僑中學，中華　校，東安小學，潔貞女校，河內有中華學校，福建學校，嶺東學校，中西學校，南定有强華學校，除海所華僑中學，河內中華學校兼辦初中外，其餘都是小學性質，</p>
<p>法越政府對於華僑教育大體是採取放任政策。比之暹羅，新加坡等地要寬大得多，紀念週，三民主義教育，抗戰講演可以自由舉行，校內救亡活動如捐欵　寒衣等可以隨時辦理，不受干涉，學校的課程，訓導，教科書等，也由各校任意採用，在條例上，華僑學校裏每週有教授法文兩小時的規定，但執行並不嚴格，故有些學校均不添設，有的學校只在課程表上填上科目及時數，實際上並沒有教授。河內衛生局方面有時也派人到各校巡視，對于課室容量，定出額數，依其面積多少，規定學校可收容學生的總數，可是華僑學校，因為環境上的原因，校舍狹隘，學生衆多，只好虛應故事，置之不理，聽說二年以前福建學校高級小學一年級用的公民教科書採用商務教本，因所述涉及三民主綫，曾被檢查沒收一次，但其他各校並無此種情形，福建學校以後亦不聞受有若何限制，最近童軍訓練須在地方當局備案，始准組織及行動，立案手續亦不刁難，現聞法當局因童軍一名，涉及軍事，擬令飭各校改稱服務團，確否待證。此外，有一件事法政府懸為厲禁的是安南人子弟絕對不能遭華僑學校，故僑校至今，尚無收容安南學生事實，屬校至　，亦從未與安南學校，法人學校發生聯絡，成地方教育的一種超然組織。</p>
<p>從華　學校的本身說，一般的與論，規模及歷史，河內推中華學校，海防推華僑中學，此間華僑教育的普遍缺點，是校董任意干涉校政的　氣，大概華僑學校的設立，教育的意義並不重大，多半把學校當做面子上不能不有的組織，譬如廣府帮有一間學校，潮汕稱福建帮也非要有一間學校不可，有的學校是先有教員後有學校，可以說是因人而設的一個機關，僑校校董多係該校經濟支撑者，亦半屬本地殷富。這些老前輩自已受教育的程度不高，對于教育沒有明白的觀念，因此，時常把學校當做開店看待，自己是店主，教員是夥計，好在顧客就是自己的子弟，喜歡怎樣就怎樣，有一間學校辦得不亞于一間典型的私塾，教員哭喪着臉說，校董要這樣辦，不然就請你走，結果學校像三家村的古董一樣，體育遊戲唱歌沒有，公民社會也沒有，勞作奮軍吏沒有，小學生只好鎭日坐在桌子邊念國文，做算術，習字，背書，有二間學校沒有操塲，据說是校童不許的緣故，在老前輩的心眼裏進學校的目的，不外讀書識字，跳跳要要，要來幹什麼。一間學校裏面的校董名稱非常複雜，有正校董，有副校董，有常務校董，有校董兼校長，有校董兼會計，有校董兼庶務，有巡視委員，有庶務委員，頗有把校董當官銜有待的習氣，校董兼校長的，自己不常川駐校，只委托一二位教員親信料理校務，不翁校長的校董是太上校長，事無大小，仍要請示决定，一般的現象，校董對校務的阻碍多過建設，有些學校的教職員是隨校董的去留而去留的，閩粵各帮帮長或二年三年一任，任滿改選，新帮長上台，舊校長及舊教員一律滾蛋，故行政及教學的人員多存五日京兆之心，沒有還大的計細與實際，又因主持校務者多講求關係的緣故，所引甩的教員，有的是小學畢衆。有的簡直沒有准過小學，師資學歷旣濫且寬，就中比較好的是海防的福建學校，執教的都是集美學校的畢業生，工作很有朝氣，河內的華僑中學，教員由　學畢業者不少，勵精圖治之心甚决，下學期計劃兼辦高中，前途很有希望，南定的强華學校，年餘來整頓得頗有起色，主校者確有理想與經驗。這幾間學校受校　的干涉比較少，故發展得也比較快。</p>
<p>安南華僑學校還有一點一致的毛病，就是校舍設備的簡陋，校舍的所在地是會舘，關帝廟，龍母廟　天后宮等，有的學校前任校長一倒台，便席捲所有，逃之夭夭，有的學校根本並沒有圖書費，設備費，及校舍修葺費，規模人的學校如海防華僑，河內中華，　生總在千數，看見　們五六十人擠在課室裏上課的情况，實在虧苦，規模小的學校，教室與教室之間不加間隔，一望三里，如一字長院陣，嘈聲盈耳，簡直像一個菜肉市塲，有許多學　沒有圖書會，沒有補充教材，學生教員都捧羞教科書在盡他神聖的任務。</p>
<p>在課程方面，因為安南是法屬，所以父兄很重視洗文，國內的課程標準第一外國語之規定是英文，因此，有一間學校便異想天開的兼讀國文，英文，法文，認為是他辦學的特點。還有一間學校自稱中西學校，上午讀中文，下午讀法文，上午請了一批老先生來教國文，下午請幾個安南教員來教法文，行政組織上有中文校長，中文秘書。西文校長，西文秘書，學校却是小學性質，華僑子弟受了這種非牛非馬的細練，不知道預備做麽什用的。在教法方面，廣東人辦的學校用　州話，福建人辦的學校用廈門話，潮汕人辦的學校用潮州話，據福建校學。嶺東學校的教員講，這些學生初入學時，只會講安南話，他們家長送子弟來入學，主要的目的也是學廈門話或潮州話，我們看這一羣天眞活潑的祖國孩子們，滿口安南話，一身安南氣，眞是又好氣又好笑！</p>
<p>我訪問了這麽多華僑學校的結果。我深切的感覺到，華僑教育的問題不在于經費而在于人事，不在干教育本身，而在教育背景，華僑辦教育的錢是有的，但辦教育的意義是不懂的，僑務委員會每年補助僑教的經費並不是改進僑教的根本辦法，根本的辦洗是教他們辦，監督他們辦，華僑教育是國家教育的一環，也是國家教育政策的一个對象。我們不能忽略了海外的僑胞　我們也不能忽略了僑咆子弟的教育，在目前教育部對於華僑教育的督導實為當務之急。目前華僑教育需要的是强有力的統制良好的人才與師資，把過去　營的華僑教育置之國家經營之下，在海外各地作合理的師資訓練，同時擴大華僑教育的範圍，把成人，靑年，兒童都作為教育的對象，施與訓練，這棵一來，華僑教育庶有發揚光大之一日。</p>
<h3>第三次全國教育會議　蔣委員長訓詞</h3>
<p>（續昨日第三版）</p>
<p>我們不能整個國民都成為高深的學問家、和專門技術家一樣、但是就國民而論、執業雖有萬殊、但是修養都要一律、如果基本修養不差、或大或小、都能與社會國家有貢献的、所以教育上最基本的任務、在于國民人格的陶冶、要陶冶國民人格、就不能不要求全國教育界確立一致的趨向、認淸自身地位和責任、集中到一個日標之下、以身作則、來造成普遍的風氣、這裏我有幾句重要的話、要提示我們教育界、</p>
<p>第一件事、我要求我們教育界、認淸楚『尊師重道』的意義、學記上　、『凡學之道、跋師為難、師嚴然後道尊、道尊然後民知敬學』這所謂嚴師之嚴、並不是夏楚之威、執扑之施的、乃是說爲教師者、必須嚴于自律、而後師這乃尊、所以今天我們要明教育、　必先確立師資、師資本身、有了可尊之道、學半靑年和一般民衆自然相　而善、我們從前專制時代、政治不善、吏治不良、少數有志節有學問的人、隱於教書講學、一般人奉為淸高、以爲天子不得而臣、這是一種維繫士氣的苦心、但是現在是民國時代、每憫國民自政府官吏以至于為社會服務的人、實際上都是為國家和人民服務、教育界的責任、不論公立私立、都是由國家所賦與、並不是像從前時代、由君主或政府所賦與、朋以我們教育人士、就决小能自居于國家法令以外、以不受任命爲淸高、以尊重法令爲卑損人格、這種落伍的錯誤觀念、若不勇敢地急切糾正、這麽所教出來的學生、就只有散漫凌亂放縱自私、這樣還能成為現代國民嗎、我們肌要以教育救國建國、必須由教育人員嚴守國法、尊重紀律、視國家尊嚴、重于個人的尊嚴、才能表率靑年、風動民衆、使我們一盤散沙的舊習慣、變成凝聚堅固、楚齊團結的新氣象、而後戰時可以制勝、戰後可以建國、第二件事、我們要陶冶國民人格、必須有　致的標準、在訓　上、要提出簡單而共通的要目、討育上的實施細則、儘管可以因地域階段、和學校性質而分別訂定、但訓育的目標、最好能作共通的决定、、現在我們各級學校、往往各自制定各校的校訓、所取德目、互有重輕、非常的不一致、我們人的意見、　為總理、忠孝仁愛信義和平的八德、以及黨員守則、可訂為靑年守則、一致信守以外、所有全國各級學校、可以禮義　恥四字為共通的校調、這四個字旣又簡單通行、包含了我國固有的國民行為的基準、也包含了近代國民必具的品格、我們以「禮」的含義、教訓國民互助合作、守紀律、重秩序、以「義」的含義、教訓國民、任俠果敢、負責任、肯犧牲、以『廉』的含義、教訓國民、刻苦節約、辨別公私、守職分、戒侵　、以「恥』的含義、教訓國民、自强自立、能奮鬥、知進取、這樣因數千年來深人人心的教條、做成現代國民必備的品德、然後大小長短、可使各盡其材、以求得國家民族的生存與發展、第三件事、我要求我們教育界齊一趨向、集中目標、確確實實的　實現三民主義而努力、我們自民　　國十七年四月第一次教育會議、决議了推行三民主義教育案以後、到今天已過十年、就是十八年　華民國教有宗旨的頒布、距今也已十年、但是在抗戰以前、我們全國民薛和一般靑年、實際上並沒有普遍受着三民主義的教化、就是在抗戰之中、也還不能眞誠一致的信奉三民主義、這固然是國家的不幸、實在也是我們教育行政方面以及教育界共同的恥辱、我以爲革命建國的最高原則、如果不能普遍傳授于民衆、則革命是無法成功、國家是無法脫離危險的、我們教育界負着存亡興衰的大責任、對于立國最高原則、决不可陽奉陰違、决不可形式上是接受了、而實際上還是各逞所見、各行其是、教育的責任是教民、民無信不立、如果教育界先是心口相違、不講信義、不重實行、我們如何能導引民衆入十意忘統一、精神集中的地步、我們知道國家民族盛衰興亡、中外古今、何代不有、凡是轉危為安、必定由這一個國家的知識分子和教育界、從衆志紛岐民氣衰頸的當中、集中志同道合的人、為一個目標而奮門、來祖負旋磚氣運的責任、現在抗戰已入最嚴重階段、×人所畏忌而欲打擊的、就是我們革命救國的三民主義、我們教育界要救國家危亡、就不可不以實現三民主義引為自身的責任中國國民黨對于全國有志救國的賢智之士、始終是殷切期待加入本黨共同奮鬥的、尤其在此國家存亡呼吸的抗戰時間、對于全國先知先覺各　　校校長教授、更切風雨同舟之　、我們革命同志愈多、抗戰力最愈人、而救國事業、不僅愈易、而且成功時期、亦必更快、我們要革命加速完成、要抗戰提早勝利、至少要担負教育責任的同胞們、同心一德、為三民主義而努力、就以教育的功效來講、荀子勸學篇所謂、「目不兩視而明、耳不兩　為聰」、又說、「其儀一兮、心如結兮、故君子結于一」也也是說明教育的方向、必須定于一鵠、如果徘徊于四達之路的歧點、目不正視於一端、耳不專　于一向、徬徨迷亂的結果、是教不出勇於為學、篤於力行、救國救民的學者來的、現在國家處于非常時期時間、不能等待、國事不容再誤、過去教育上趨向不堅定、信守不專一、已經躭誤了十載的光陰、造成了嚴　的國難、我眞不能不竭誠希望我們教育界為國家民族的前途、為當代靑年和後代國民的幸羅、而眞誠確實的歸于一致、「其儀一兮、心如結兮」、我願我們教育界各位賢達、一心一德向志同道、决心集結到三民義主的總目標之下、為中國革命而努力　　、我們全國教育界本身的勞苦和艱難、是全國同胞所深深了解的、抗戰以來、更是加倍的辛苦、特別顯著、我們的努力、我們在戰區、在淪陷區域內、在遼的後方、都在得出教育界辛苦奮鬥的成績、我敢說這些耕耘的勞力、必定會培出民族復興的果實來的、我們大家所希望的、自然不在當前的酬報、而是建國大功告成以後給予我們的安慰、但是我們教育界必須自立自重、專心一志、以百年樹人的抱負、和舍我其誰的氣概、來實行我上面所說的話、終身貢献于教育救國的大事業、古人說、「、而舍之、杇木不折、　而不舍、金石可鏤』、　是有志竟成一定的道理、我以十分的誠意、祝本　會議、超越前屆的成功、祝我們教育界爲抗戰建國建立無量可比的功績、（完）</p>

<p>自由談麻城河畔  李輝英　　麻城河就在麻城的近郊；河水淸淸一塵不染，從遠遠的大別山中穿山越嶺地奔流着，到這麻城近傍平地上，流得四平八穩，恰像一具鏡面。綠　伴着沙灘，在河兩岸排列起來，烟霧籠罩着像一重無底的網，到處浮動着稻香，和淸新而冷人的氣息。　　河水不深，但河面寬得儼然是大河模樣，河中間有裸露着三五成羣的沙坵，像些島嶼，沒有僑樑，沒有渡船，想過河還是要脫了鞋襪，解下裏腿去涉水。　　岸旁，屯聚着三五家舖房，賣燒餅，賣油條還賣豆漿，包子是熱氣騰騰的，先來的同志們，有三四個吃了東西坐着休息。　　在牆壁上，貼着各式各樣的標語，還配着一些宣傳漫畫，這是城郊的宣傳工作，雖然賽得並不好看，甚而還有晝得不合理的地方，却有些鄉下人聚精　神地觀看，另外幾張油印的壁報孤零零地沒有人溜上一眼。　　鬧鬨地從灘河上奔過來一羣人，那柳認眞奔跑的樣子，叫人一看就要猜到，大概是發生子什麽事情。拉夫麽？慌張地逃跑麽？不！他們是來兜攪生意的，一個擠着一個爭搶着說說：　　「同志，過河麽？」　　「同志，我背你。」　　「背過河好吧？隨便，賞多少算多少。」　　足足有二十個，這大羣的鄉下人，為着背人過河，叫鬧不休、他們之中，為了搶生意的原故，不時地，彼此之間叫罵起來，有的人舉起拳頭，跳着脚，作出打人的姿式。　　「去，我們不用背。」　　「不，剛剛過去的同志們全是背的。」　　這情勢，似乎是說，旣然已經肯過一些人；那麽這剩餘後來的人是不能推辭的。　　同志同志地，他們叫得爛熟，誰能小看這些鄉下人呢？他們也知道把老總兩字不再用來稱呼當乒的了。　　買包子的男主人，張開嘴哈哈大笑。　　「你們同志們不知道，他們這兩天專為背人，背你們弟兄已經作了不少生意。別看不起鄉下人，也知道投機取巧呢。」。　　「聽你這口氣，倒不像湖北人」同志張搭上話，嘴里正嚼着包子。　　「我麽，自然不是本地人」，世故地沉思一下，他接着說，「若不虧得打仗，也許我還不會作買賣，告訴諸位，我是安徽人，原是辨小學教育的。」　　怪不得，一看他那樣子，就顯然跟當地的鄉下人不同，作買賣，全沒有市儈氣，學校的環境深深地束縛着他，使他一言一行都在不知覺中帶出些斯文的氣魄。　　「我有一個兒子，也正在當兵……」　　「在那個部隊里？」張攔住話頭，親熱地問。　　「瞥他這些，能打勝仗就算了。」　　「你不想他？」　　論說我這孩子眞是不錯」，他像是沒有見別人的問話，仍在繼續着說。『中學快畢業了，眼看可以找個小事情作，自己照料自己的生活。可是鬼子來了。我那天告訴他準備準備，好一齊開步走。一天，他哭着對我說，　　「　爸爸，我要走了。」　　「我滿以為他心慌想快些走，就安撫他說：　　「慌什麻，一道走。」　　『一道走？』他搖了搖頭，擦　了眼淚。『誰跟你一道走，告訴你，爸爸，我要當兵去！　』　　「那麽你呢？」張打住了話頭，猛然問了一句，別人聽得亦滿起勁，恰如聽賣藝人在講平詞。　　「別　我的話頭，聽我慢慢說，我當特一聽，還以爲這孩子是說笑話，但一看他滿臉的淚痕，我立卽明白過來，這是一件眞事。　　『　好孩于，你是中華民國的子國民！』　　『我親暱地連連拍着他的肩膀，自己眼眶也濕潤，可是我終於制止住感情的奔放，勉勵着說：　　「　好孩子，你有你的前途！」　　「　爸爸我就走了。」　　「　走罷，」我搖着手給他送行。「有工夫，多來幾封信。」　　「我這孩子掉回頭，壯足了氣力囘了我這麽一句叫我死後也忘不了的話：　　「　信麽？爸爸，抗日勝利那一天，才是我為信的日子！　　「好，我祝你的成功！「現在，哦，他也許為我們的國家流盡了那最後的一滴血。」　　「不會的！」張叫了起來，他一定殺死無數的鬼子了！」　　那些爭搶生意的鄉下人，到這時聽得發呆了，只聽有人半帶着驚訝語氣挿口說道：　　「想不到，還有這麽能幹的人啊。」　　「比你們離開田地，來作這背人買賣好千百倍！」　　喀嘻地笑着，人們把這緊張的故事聽完，眼看兜不到生意。鬨地一聲就散開去了。高潮中的青年  彭泰　　一個陰沉的早晨，惠州府城的街上，來往着無數的靑年，黃綠色的棉外套，裝束得每個粗大結實的身軀，格外的肥胖：還有軍帽，腰閒的皮帶，脚上沾染了泥士的草鞋，分明是學生軍的模樣。這模樣在劫後的惠州，覺得相當的生疏，這生疏吸誘了每個行人，同時也吸引了筆者的注意。筆者便鼓了勇氣，找這學生軍模樣的靑年談話了。他們很熱情，帶我去見他們的領隊。　　就在被×人炸斷的東新橋下，停泊着大大小小的民船，（因為惠州縣城的商店燒光了，商業的繁榮移到惠州府城來的眼前，東新橋頭是一個碼頭。）這羣靑年就是停泊這碼頭邊最大的一隻船裏。歌聲從篷底衝出來，掩沒了混雜的街市的騷昔。　　領隊的原來就是教官，這羣靑年就是雙十節人營的高中以上的集訓學生。　　『貴隊什麽從什麽地方來？現在去那裏？』我問。　　『我們是從連縣來的，因為三個月的集訓期滿了，除了大部份返雲南廣西及各地考大學考軍校之外，這一隊共三百多人，現在是送他們囘香港澳門原校讀書的。』教官很和氣，很淸亮的回答。　　「囘原校讀書嗎？」　　「是的。不過，因為有許多失陷地區的靑年不能囘去了。留着冉訓練的也很多。其次，在××地方還有地方行政幹部訓練，裏面就有大部份是集訓的學生。」　　談了不久，教官和×報館的記者談話了。我轉向靑年們那面，一點沒有拘束，隨便的說，這倒能明白了許多極微小的事情。他們在炮火中有許多的苦悶，他們在炮中有無限的憤怒，因此，有幾次要求過上火線服務，結果還不能得到實現所願。聽之令人心痛。然而，他們是在炮火中覺悟了，在炮火中堅强了。當筆者問到：「現在有一排人的軍隊給你指揮可以嗎？」　　「我們訓練期中，身體健康了許多，在軍事知識方面，一排人當然可以指揮得住的。根本我們在學校時也受過軍訓啦！』大家哈哈地笑起來了。中華民族解放鬥爭的時代裏，靑年人好像就是一爐烈火，沒有虛偽，沒有長縮，於此一見可知了。苦中的樂境  覆平　　煤油大王洛克斐勒年靑的時候，因為家境貧寒，他從田莊跑到城市裏找一點事情。這時剛巧是經濟恐慌的年頭，他整天躑躅街頭，却一無所獲，正在失望地準備回到錢莊裏去，突然來了一個小機會，他在某　行裏得到一份職卑薪薄的小位置。　　他從九月廿六日開始工作，適遇該店經濟困難，拖欠薪水直至第二年一月一日才發給，三个多月的勤勞，他一共僅得到五十塊錢，數目雖小，然而在他的生活裏却是一个極大的轉機，這使他永生不忘。後使他成爲世界最大當翁，於每年九月廿六日便舉行一個慶祝大會，比較他的誕辰紀辰念還要隆重。　　有人曾經問過他，在他的生命中那二個時期最為快梁？他想了好一囘，從生命所賜給他的許多愉快與滿足的事情中，他承認第一个職業開始的幾个星期是他的最快樂的時候。雖然是他最艱苦的一个時期。　　有許多人往往見異思遷，不耐煩予目前的環境，以為別的地方一定比目前的地方好，這實在是錯的。我跟一個曾經幽禁在監獄裏十四年的政治犯談話，我說：「十四年來太辛苦你了。」　　他囘答說：「不見得，那裏有很多事情令我發生興趣。」　　因為他認識環境，所以監獄也會變成與趣的秘庫，變成靈魂的內府。　　世界上沒有一個人能像救世軍裏的變孚女士那樣的整年整日包圍在痛苦與貧困的氛圍裏的，她所有的時間，完全用來接觸社會的底層，也許環境令使他變成一個頹喪煩悶的人吧，然而希奇得很，她竟然是一個最快樂的女人。　　她雖是七十歲的高年，肩頭上却還担着那繁重的責任，每天早農午時起來，在辦公室裏他諦聽着各種不幸與痛苦的報告，悽慘的故事往往使她同情地停止了笑容，她把這些故事帶囘家裏，帶到枕邊，直到一切處置妥當她才覺快慰，固然，他的責任沒有完止的時候，可是她承認今天的責任就是今天的快樂。　　試從社會之羣中觀察一下，我們將發覺那些將注意力集於責任上的人才是最快樂的人，並且常常是最成功的人。　　在長期沉港的抗戰中，誠然，我們是無時不包園在災難與創痛的氛圍裏，但是，如果我們將自己所應負的責任肩荷起來，我們便能從積極的與奮中忘却一切痛苦，更由堅强的信念做成樂觀的情緒，而永來的最後勝利是必將由全民衆的樂觀中所做成的。　　艱苦，貧困，災難，創痛，都是成功的種子，讓這些種子長出在我們的肩頭吧，快樂是從責任得來。木蘭從軍  鄒嘯　　——民旅小說話　　木蘭的故事，最早的記載當然是『木蘭詩』，見樂府詩集卷二十五。關於這苜詩的時代，聚訟紛紜，十年前徐中舒等，在東方雜誌上曾有過幾次熱烈的討論，直到前年，還有曲瑩生繼續的研討。徐中舒斷定木蘭詩是初唐與盛唐之間的作品，姚大榮則以為應屬隋末唐初；這兩種說法　與後來小說的說法相同。　　接着便是唐代韋元甫的續詩，樂府詩集云：「浙江西道觀察使兼御史中亟韋元甫續附入。」中有警句云：「親戚持酒賀父母，始知生女與子同。」　　此後詠木蘭的詩想來不少，惟戲劇方面似乎到了明代，纔有徐文長寫過一種雜劇「雌木蘭」，多據原詩敷衍，想像分子甚少。　　直到淸初，才有褚人穫的「隋唐演義」插寫一段木蘭，第五十六回為「代從軍木蘭孝父」，第五十九囘為「奇女子鳳閣沾恩」。另外添出一個妹妹花又蘭，與羅成相戀，寫來頗為出色，似比花木蘭寫得更為成功。　　淸光緒十九年總有品文堂刊本的「忠孝勇烈奇女傳」四卷三十二回，這也就是本文所要說的「木蘭從軍」了。「木蘭從軍」是坊間代改的書名。此書文白夾雜。故事純爲揑造。稱木蘭詩為李靖作。又夾雜了許多道士成仙的話，極為可哂。中間穿挿隋唐間韓擒虎賽建德尉遲恭褚遂良等事，直到第八回朱木蘭方纔降生。據修慶氏原序所說，則是根據「後唐書」的。此書不曾見過；但查新舊唐書，則旣無木蘭。亦無朱木蘭，大約是作者隨意捏造故事，再捏造書名引以自重的吧？　　淸末劉申叔，（中古文學史著者）作亂彈「木蘭從軍」，最近「閒書」雜誌曾重刊一次，增出小丑為木蘭的堂兄，不敢打仗，於是木蘭挺身願往，故意拿懦怯襯託勇敢，唱句甚好；惟過於文雅，似非一般人所能了解，且因無經騐之故，故造句多生拗難于上口，反不及梅蘭芳所演的那一本。　　梅蘭芳的「木蘭從軍」物入戲考第二十九冊。據北平國劇學會圖書館目面二二，云此劇為齊如山所作。差不多完全根據木蘭詩原作引子與下場詩甚至巧妙的引用原句。如木蘭云：「萬里赴戎機，關山度若飛。朔氣侵雙鬢，寒光照鐵衣」僅改三字。又云：「歸來見天子，天子坐明堂。」木蘭弟云：「磨刀霍霍向猪羊。」警句亦多，如木蘭之母阻其夫花弧從軍，花弧云：一我想當兵，乃人人應盡義務。如果大家存了個怕死的心，只圖安樂，不救國難，國家要這百國姓何用！我雖然上了些年紀，自問還能一戰，就是戰死沙塲也留下一個好男兒的榜樣，何怕之有？』後來木蘭之母又阻止木蘭，木蘭也說：「我想為國分憂，男女都是一樣，倘然一國之中，都要靠男子，女子豈不是廢物了？况且照歷史看來，古今女子，領兵殺賊的，也多得很呢」。最後又云「：女子若肯立志，也同男子一樣。』是的，女子同男子一樣，最近不是廣西陝西都有女子從軍麽？文人如謝冰瑩胡蘭畦胡萍黎明健等輩，不也是出入於戰場而有報告文藝的寫作麼？遙祝  柳攸　　在一個深夜裏，我從好夢中驚醒，突然憶起我的摯友，一個富有熱情的靑年。　　他不怕困難，克服了各種阻礙，亳無留戀地忘捨了一切，隻身奔向異地，爲祖國去效勞了。　　我欽佩他，我羨慕他、我將他看作一個勇士，能够戰勝一切，像他那宋年輕，有毅力，有智慧，無疑的，他有細遠大的前程，光明的將來。　　他去盡他的責任，不怕迢迢千里，離隔了最親愛的家，更不怕辛勞艱苦，他一定要到達他的目的。這是他的高尚，他的偉大。　　我突然憭起，他在天涯一角，正在幹着不杇的事業，他大概不會想起我，因為他沒有時間去想，我又是極渺小的。　　我呢！我却忘不了他，我時刻記着他，我的周圍有着無數和他同樣的靑年，可是却及不到他，他是一個卓犖超羣的人。　　我想讚美他，歌頌他，可是這不是他所需要的。我祇有躲在一角，遙祝他順利前進，為祖國而奮門着，更願有着更多的同志。大家合力取得「成功」，　　我遙祝他，日裏，晚上，無論在什麽時候！</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Second Phase Resistance Propaganda</h3>
<p>Now, twenty months have passed since the full-scale War of Resistance began. The military and political situation has undergone significant changes. The enemy and Chinese traitors are actively launching their new conspiracies. Our country's strategic politics and the overall international situation have also made significant progress. How should we explain this new situation to the national public and international figures? How should we instruct our countrymen and international figures on their current position and urgent tasks? This is the most urgent and important work for civil movement and propaganda workers, as well as for the media and education sectors. The Central Government has now decided to hold the first propaganda week of the second phase of the War of Resistance from March 6th to 12th, and has clearly stipulated the following measures: (1) Propaganda rallies will be held uniformly throughout the country during the propaganda week; (2) Special broadcasts and lectures will be held; (3) Special issues will be published in newspapers and periodicals; (4) Propaganda teams will be organized in various regions to conduct propaganda in rural areas; (5) Lecture meetings will be held in various schools; (6) Special propaganda activities will be held in various entertainment venues such as cinemas and theaters. In addition, a large number of propaganda materials will be prepared and distributed to the war zones. Regarding the content of the propaganda, the Third Department of the Political Department of the Telecommunications Committee has also formulated an outline for the second phase of the War of Resistance propaganda. It is generally based on Generalissimo Chiang's refutation of Konoe's absurd statement and the opening remarks of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang as the basic principles of the second phase of the War of Resistance propaganda. Our media should immediately express its enthusiastic support and loyal implementation of this move by the Central Government. However, in order to obtain the due results, we would also like to offer our knowledge for reference by the media, education sector, and all propaganda workers.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of propaganda for the second phase of the War of Resistance, the main focus should be on the following two issues: First, how to instruct on the new situation of the second phase of the War of Resistance and the new tasks of the entire nation; and second, how to smoothly complete the propaganda tasks of the second phase of the War of Resistance. The second phase of the War of Resistance is a period of drastic change in the enemy's superiority and our inferiority, and a period of actively crushing the enemy's offensive and preparing our counter-offensive. Our main task during this period is to highly promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, overcome pessimistic and despairing emotions, oppose compromise and surrender proposals, strictly implement the elimination of traitors, adhere to national unity against the enemy, and strive for final victory; it is to carry out propaganda and persuasion work to achieve sincere support from the people of the whole country for the government and the leader, support for Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and national unity, and opposition to divisive attempts and any traitorous puppet organizations; it is to expand the mass movement, develop mass organizations, unite all ethnic groups in the country, including Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yao, and Yi, mobilize and concentrate the living and non-living forces of the broad masses, and actively participate in the war of resistance and national construction; it is to improve the combat power of the main forces on the front lines, expand the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, rapidly build new armies and prepare for counter-offensive forces, in order to crush the enemy's offensive and promote our army's counter-offensive; it is to accelerate the progress of domestic politics, improve political institutions at all levels, implement democratic politics, implement wartime financial and economic policies, implement necessary improvements in people's livelihoods, strengthen the ties between the government, the army, and the people, and maximize the effectiveness of the anti-Japanese regime; it is to accelerate the development of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression united front in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and around the world, and strive for more foreign aid for our country's war of resistance and national construction. Now, the overall war situation, the real situation between the enemy and ourselves, and the international situation all prove that the War of Resistance has turned to the second stage that is beneficial to us, and we should fully publicize the urgent tasks that the sons and daughters of China should shoulder in the current stage.</p>
<p>In order to make all Chinese sons and daughters deeply and clearly understand and heroically and resolutely shoulder the above-mentioned urgent tasks, the Central Government has decided to expand the propaganda of the second phase of the War of Resistance and has stipulated the specific measures for the first propaganda week. In order to successfully complete the propaganda tasks of the second phase of the War of Resistance, in addition to following the specific measures stipulated by the Central Government, we feel that we should also pay serious attention to the following points:</p>
<p>First, resolutely and strictly oppose speech and actions that violate unity in the War of Resistance: The main characteristics of the new situation in the War of Resistance are the determination of the long-term nature of the war, and the determination that the enemy cannot support the long-term war and that our country will surely win the victory by intensifying unity and adhering to the long-term War of Resistance. Therefore, the enemy's new strategy focuses particularly on undermining our country's unity and undermining the long-term War of Resistance. Since the incident, although no one in the country dares to make remarks or take actions that violate the national policy of resistance against the enemy, those who continue to use their traitorous skills under various disguises and spread poisonous germs such as anti-communism, truce, and surrender to Japan have not yet been thoroughly eliminated, while in foreign countries and other special areas, pro-Japanese traitorous elements, under the heavy subsidies and unified command of their masters, are even more unscrupulous in promoting "peace, anti-communism, and pro-Japan" arguments and implementing the techniques of bribery with money, terror, and coercion. As for the media propaganda that supports the War of Resistance and opposes traitors, it cannot speak freely because of concerns about the "neutral" attitude of the countries concerned. This has resulted in traitors running rampant, which is a very serious situation at present and must be thoroughly combated by concentrating the power of the media and calling on international justice and peace-loving people to assist the Central Government.</p>
<p>Second, accelerate the establishment, consolidation, and development of the anti-Japanese united front in the domestic and overseas media and education sectors, and promote all propaganda and mobilization plans under the unified leadership of the Central Government. Use the power of the united front to assist the government in thoroughly eliminating pro-Japanese traitors and pro-peace elements lurking in the country, severely combat the "anti-communist, peace, and pro-Japanese" speeches and actions that incite international relations, and accelerate the mobilization of all forces at home and abroad to the anti-Japanese united front to serve the support of the War of Resistance and national construction to strive for final victory.</p>
<p>Third, actively promote national diplomatic movements, expand international propaganda, and do everything possible to use appropriate methods to launch and develop the people's front against fascism and anti-aggression within the invading countries, and to unite and expand the people of all countries and Taiwan, Korea, and the puppet Manchukuo against fascism and anti-aggression, and use these two efforts to promote the real sanctions of democratic and peace-loving countries against fascist aggressors and to strive for greater sympathy and assistance from all countries for our country's War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, of course, it is also necessary to consolidate the foundation of propaganda work, that is, we must do everything possible to accelerate political progress, consolidate national unity, mobilize the power of the whole nation, and adhere to the War of Resistance to the end, because only these facts can guarantee the smooth success of the War of Resistance propaganda. Only these facts can crush all the enemy's hypocritical propaganda and conspiracies.</p>
<p>The media and education sectors in this special environment should feel even more deeply the seriousness of the situation and the arduousness of their own responsibilities at this time when the Central Government is expanding the War of Resistance propaganda movement! At this turning point in the fate of the nation, when the enemy's "peace" heresy is rampant, we should work together with one heart and one mind and strive together.</p>

<p>The golden age of overseas Chinese trade in Annam has become a relic of days gone by. Elderly overseas Chinese often reminisce about the glory of trade in the past, lamenting the decline of commerce today. Fifty or sixty years ago, the commercial port of Annam was not in Haiphong, but around Nam Dinh in the west. Inheriting the nation's adventurous spirit and enterprising will, Chinese people sailed from the coast of Fujian in old junks, drifting for months to reach Vietnam. Those who unfortunately died in the storms could only accept their fate. As for those who were lucky enough to have a smooth voyage or reached their destination after many hardships, they had a sure opportunity to make a fortune. At that time, the Chinese were called "Uncle Tang." When Chinese guests and goods arrived at the port, they did not need to hire carriers or advertise. Many people would rush to buy them. When doing business, the Annamese could only stand at the door, holding their breath and waiting for "Uncle Tang" to quote a price. If the price was too high or the hoarding was too excessive, they would not dare to argue or bargain. They could only humbly ask "Uncle Tang" for mercy and give them a bowl of rice to eat, so as not to lose money. Every time a junk arrived at the port, there would be several months of good business. The natives had to buy goods from them, as there was no other way. Therefore, it was a sure thing to earn ten times the capital. Later, as the sea ban gradually opened, the business of the Chinese suffered some blows, but because of historical relations and credit, they still held the upper hand. Until the Battle of Qiongzhou, when the French officially occupied Annam, Chinese trade still had its privileges. When the customs office was established, the cargo of overseas Chinese did not need to be declared or inspected. They only needed to submit a bill of lading to the customs office to pay the taxes. In recent years, Vietnam has been very attentive to the commerce of overseas Chinese. The commerce of overseas Chinese is mainly dominated by Guangdong and Fujian, and they deal in hardware, tea, leather, lace, rice wine, firecrackers, silver foil, food and beverages, porcelain, antiques, and other businesses. The Vietnamese and French authorities, on the one hand, used tariff barriers to restrict the import of Chinese goods, and on the other hand, they vigorously encouraged Annam to be self-sufficient and operate its own businesses. In the past, Annam's commerce was mostly run by women, and the scale was not large. Most of them wholesaled from Chinese merchants and retailed. Since the Vietnamese and French authorities universally implemented Latin script, Annamese easily acquired the skills of writing. Chinese characters were gradually eliminated, and accounting books were all recorded in phonetic script. At the same time, after receiving primary education, Annamese were idle at home with nothing to do. The old view that regarded business as a lowly profession gradually disappeared. Therefore, under the protection of the government and new methods of operation, the Annamese's commerce actually gradually gained the labor of competing with others. The overseas Chinese in Annam mostly stick to old methods, and the styles of goods have remained the same for decades without thinking of improvement. Among overseas Chinese, because the business is not good, there have been repeated cases of mutual attacks. They only know the decline of commerce in recent years, but they do not know that the reason for the decline lies in the conservatism of business methods and the lack of progress of goods. Therefore, in addition to self-pity and shrinking the scale of business, mutual killings and individual competition have become their only countermeasures. It is said that in Hanoi, because of the internal struggle of wine merchants, they could not even earn the surplus of a wine bottle, and their predicament can be imagined. Five years ago, eight out of ten stores on Guangdong Street in Hanoi were opened by overseas Chinese. Now, less than three out of ten stores are opened by Chinese. The situation on Yaoren Street and Tokyo Street in Haiphong is similar. The profitable businesses now are hotels and restaurants, not to mention that they are still earning the money of the Chinese. This is the matter of the year of the War of Resistance, not to mention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Annam's industry and commerce have made great progress in the past twenty years. France has done its best to support all methods that can increase the production of natives. In the rural areas of Vietnam, it is common to see people riding motorcycles to teach various methods of increasing agricultural products. In agricultural side businesses such as sericulture, spinning, and animal husbandry, French people often guide them everywhere. The research institutes of Dongfa University have also done a lot of business guidance work. In the past, Chinese-patented commodities, such as tea, wine, porcelain, and firecrackers, can now be made by Annamese themselves. Traces of such self-made products are commonly seen in the market. Generally, after Annamese can produce each commodity themselves, the tariff on that commodity is immediately increased to curb the import of foreign products. The decline of overseas Chinese commerce is precisely this one reason is the fatal main reason. In Hanoi, a commercial and industrial product exhibition is held every three years, collecting self-made products from various places and listing them in various rooms. All buildings are provided by the government at a considerable cost. The fourteenth exhibition opened in November 1938, and the content was rich, including paper, rice, wine, tea, cloth, silk, and even mineral products and medicinal materials. There were more than ten tanks of fish products, indicating that they were produced by Yunbianfu, and they are currently being transplanted and researched. The meaning is profound, and the policy is meticulous, which makes people shudder. Fortunately, the history and credit of overseas Chinese trade are still admired by the French and Annamese. Market trade is manipulated by the French, and overseas Chinese still have a surplus to share in the transshipment and wholesale. Overseas Chinese and Annamese have always had a good relationship. Since the War of Resistance, Sino-French relations have been harmonious, which is reflected in the commercial sector and also provides many conveniences. The French have said: "No matter what, the Chinese are always better than the Japanese. If a Japanese comes, we have to use a spy to deal with him. If a few Chinese come, we can at least let them live with peace of mind." Therefore, although the commerce of overseas Chinese has declined compared to before, it is not easy to be able to struggle and maintain saturation.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Education in Annam</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, the education of overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong has more than 2,000 children enrolled in Haiphong and more than 1,500 in Hanoi, accounting for more than seven-tenths of school-age children. Compared with other places, it is quite popular. In terms of schools, Haiphong has Overseas Chinese Middle School, Zhonghua School, Dong'an Primary School, and Jiezhen Girls' School. Hanoi has Zhonghua School, Fujian School, Lingdong School, Zhongxi School. Nam Dinh has Qianghua School. Except for Haiphong Overseas Chinese Middle School and Hanoi Zhonghua School, which also run junior high schools, the rest are primary schools.</p>
<p>The French and Vietnamese governments generally adopt a laissez-faire policy towards overseas Chinese education. Compared with Siam, Singapore, and other places, it is much more lenient. Commemorative weeks, the Three Principles of the People education, and anti-Japanese speeches can be held freely. Salvation activities in schools, such as donating money and winter clothes, can be carried out at any time without interference. The curriculum, discipline, and textbooks of the schools are also adopted arbitrarily by each school. In the regulations, there is a provision that overseas Chinese schools should teach French for two hours per week, but the implementation is not strict. Therefore, some schools do not add it, and some schools only fill in the subjects and hours on the curriculum, but there is no teaching in practice. The Hanoi Health Bureau sometimes sends people to inspect the schools and sets a quota for the capacity of the classrooms, stipulating the total number of students that the school can accommodate according to its area. However, overseas Chinese schools, due to environmental reasons, have narrow school buildings and many students, so they have to respond perfunctorily and ignore it. It is said that two years ago, the citizenship textbook used by the first grade of the senior primary school of Fujian School adopted the Commercial Press textbook, which involved the Three Principles of the People and was confiscated once, but other schools did not have such a situation, and Fujian School has not been restricted in any way since then. Recently, children's army training must be registered with the local authorities before they are allowed to organize and act. The registration procedures are not difficult either. It is now heard that the French authorities, because the name of the children's army involves military affairs, intend to order all schools to change their name to service groups, the truth of which remains to be seen. In addition, one thing that the French government strictly prohibits is that Annamese children are absolutely not allowed to attend overseas Chinese schools. Therefore, overseas Chinese schools have not yet accepted Annamese students, and the schools have never had contact with Annamese schools or French schools, becoming a detached organization in local education.</p>
<p>From the perspective of overseas Chinese schools themselves, the general opinion is that Hanoi's Zhonghua School and Haiphong's Overseas Chinese Middle School are the best in terms of scale and history. The common shortcomings of overseas Chinese education here are the arbitrary interference of school directors in school affairs. Generally, the establishment of overseas Chinese schools does not have great educational significance. Most of them regard schools as organizations that must be on the face. For example, if the Guangfu gang has a school, the Chaoshan, also known as the Fujian gang, must have a school. Some schools have teachers before they have schools. It can be said that they are institutions established for people. Most of the school directors of overseas Chinese schools are the economic supporters of the school, and half of them are local wealthy people. These elders have not received a high level of education themselves and do not have a clear concept of education. Therefore, they often regard schools as shops. They are the shop owners, and the teachers are the employees. Fortunately, the customers are their own children, so they can do whatever they want. One school is run no less than a typical private school. The teacher says with a sad face that the school directors want to run it this way, otherwise they will ask you to leave. As a result, the school is like an antique in a three-family village. There is no physical education, games, or singing, no civics or society, and no labor or military officials. The primary school students have to sit at their desks all day long to read Chinese, do arithmetic, practice calligraphy, and recite books. Two schools do not have playgrounds, because it is said that the school children are not allowed to do so. In the minds of the elders, the purpose of going to school is nothing more than reading and writing. What is the use of jumping around? The titles of school directors in a school are very complicated. There are formal school directors, deputy school directors, standing school directors, school directors who are also principals, school directors who are also accountants, school directors who are also general affairs officers, inspection committee members, and general affairs committee members. It has the habit of regarding school directors as official titles to be treated. The school directors who are also principals do not often reside in the school and only entrust one or two trusted teachers to manage the school affairs. The school directors who are not principals are the supreme principals. No matter how big or small the matter is, they still have to ask for instructions to make a decision. In general, school directors hinder school affairs more than they build them. The faculty and staff of some schools come and go with the school directors. The gang leaders of the Fujian and Guangdong gangs serve for two or three years. When they are re-elected after their term expires, the new gang leader takes office, and the old principal and old teachers are all fired. Therefore, the administrative and teaching staff have the mentality of serving as officials for a short period of time and do not have great details and reality. Also, because those who are in charge of school affairs pay much attention to relationships, the teachers they hire have graduated from primary school. Some have simply not even graduated from primary school. The qualifications of the teachers are both lax and broad. The better ones are the graduates of the Jimei School who teach at the Fujian School in Haiphong. They are very energetic in their work. There are many teachers in Hanoi's Overseas Chinese Middle School who have graduated from universities and are determined to work hard. Next semester, they plan to run a senior high school as well, and the future is very promising. Qianghua School in Nam Dinh has improved a lot in the past year or so. The person in charge of the school has ideals and experience. These schools are less interfered with by the school and develop faster.</p>
<p>Another common problem with overseas Chinese schools in Annam is the simplicity of the school facilities. The location of the school is the guild hall, Guandi Temple, Longmu Temple, and Tianhou Palace. Some schools' former principals abscond with all the money after they are overthrown. Some schools simply do not have funds for books, equipment, and school building repairs. Schools with a large scale, such as Haiphong Overseas Chinese School and Hanoi Zhonghua School, have thousands of students. It is really pitiful to see them crowded in classrooms with fifty or sixty people. Small-scale schools do not separate the classrooms. You can see three miles away at a glance, like a long courtyard. The noise is overwhelming, like a vegetable market. Many students do not have book clubs or supplementary materials. Students and teachers are all ashamed to use textbooks to fulfill their sacred tasks.</p>
<p>In terms of curriculum, because Annam is French, parents attach great importance to French. The first foreign language stipulated in the national curriculum standard is English. Therefore, one school has the whim to study Chinese, English, and French at the same time, thinking that it is a special feature of their school. Another school calls itself Zhongxi School. It studies Chinese in the morning and French in the afternoon. It hires a group of old gentlemen to teach Chinese in the morning and several Annamese teachers to teach French in the afternoon. The administrative organization has a Chinese principal and a Chinese secretary. The Western principal and the Western secretary, but the school is a primary school. Overseas Chinese children receive this kind of non-cattle, non-horse training, and they don't know what it is for. In terms of teaching methods, the schools run by Cantonese people use Guangzhou dialect, the schools run by Fujianese use Xiamen dialect, and the schools run by Chaoshan people use Chaozhou dialect. According to the teachers of Fujian School and Lingdong School, these students only speak Annamese when they first enter school. The main purpose of their parents sending their children to school is to learn Xiamen dialect or Chaozhou dialect. When we see this group of innocent and lively children of the motherland, speaking fluent Annamese and having an Annamese air, it is really both funny and annoying!</p>
<p>As a result of my visit to so many overseas Chinese schools, I deeply feel that the problem of overseas Chinese education lies not in the funding but in the personnel, not in the education itself but in the educational background. Overseas Chinese have the money to run education, but they do not understand the meaning of running education. The funds that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission subsidizes overseas Chinese education every year are not a fundamental way to improve overseas Chinese education. The fundamental way is to teach them how to run it and supervise them to run it. Overseas Chinese education is a part of national education and also an object of national education policy. We cannot ignore the overseas Chinese, nor can we ignore the education of their children. At present, the Ministry of Education's supervision of overseas Chinese education is a matter of urgency. At present, what overseas Chinese education needs is a strong system of control, excellent talents and teachers, and to place the past privately-run overseas Chinese education under national management, to carry out reasonable teacher training in various overseas locations, and at the same time to expand the scope of overseas Chinese education, to make adults, young people, and children all objects of education, and to give them training. In this way, overseas Chinese education will have a day to be promoted and developed.</p>
<h3>Third National Education Conference - Chairman Chiang's Instructions</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's third page)</p>
<p>We cannot have the entire nation become profound scholars and specialized technicians. However, concerning the citizens, although occupations may vary greatly, cultivation should be consistent. If basic cultivation is sound, whether great or small, they can contribute to society and the nation. Therefore, the most fundamental task of education lies in cultivating national character. To cultivate national character, we must require the entire education community to establish a consistent direction, recognize its own position and responsibility, and focus on a single goal. We must lead by example to create a widespread ethos. Here, I have some important words to offer to our education community:</p>
<p>The first thing I ask of our education community is to clearly recognize the meaning of "respecting teachers and valuing the Way." In the Book of Education [Xue Ji], it says, "In the Way of learning, emulating a teacher is the most difficult. When the teacher is respected, the Way is honored. When the Way is honored, the people know to respect learning." This so-called severity of a teacher is not the power of Xia Chu (ancient punishments) or the application of beating. Rather, it means that teachers must be strict with themselves, and only then is the teacher worthy of respect. Therefore, today, if we want to understand education, we must first establish qualified teachers. If the teachers themselves have a respectable Way, students, youth, and the general public will naturally learn from them. In the past, during the autocratic era, with flawed politics and corrupt officials, a few people with aspirations and knowledge would retire to teaching and lecturing. The general public regarded them as pure and noble, believing that even the emperor could not command them. This was a painstaking effort to maintain morale. However, now it is the era of the Republic. Every citizen, from government officials to those who serve society, actually serves the country and the people. The responsibility of the education community, whether public or private, is granted by the nation, not like in the past, by a monarch or government. Therefore, we in education must not consider ourselves outside the laws of the country, regarding being unappointed as noble and respecting the law as demeaning to one's personality. If this outdated and erroneous concept is not bravely and urgently corrected, then the students taught will only be undisciplined, disorganized, unrestrained, and selfish. How can they become modern citizens? If we want to save and build the nation through education, educational personnel must strictly abide by national laws and respect discipline, valuing national dignity more than personal dignity. Only then can we set an example for the youth and influence the masses, transforming our old habit of being a "pile of loose sand" into a cohesive and strong new atmosphere. Then, in wartime, we can prevail, and after the war, we can build the nation. The second thing is that to cultivate national character, we must have consistent standards. In moral education, we must propose simple and common essential items. As for the detailed rules for implementing education, although they can be formulated separately according to region, stage, and the nature of the school, the goals of moral education should best be decided collectively. Currently, each level of school often formulates its own school motto, and the virtues chosen have varying degrees of emphasis and are very inconsistent. In our opinion, in addition to the Eight Virtues of Loyalty, Filial Piety, Benevolence, Love, Faithfulness, Righteousness, Harmony, and Peace advocated by Sun Yat-sen, and the Party Member Code, which can be prescribed as Youth Codes for consistent adherence, all schools nationwide can use the four characters of Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Honor as a common school motto. These four characters are both simple and widely understood, encompassing the criteria for national behavior inherent in our country and also including the qualities that modern citizens must possess. We use the meaning of "Propriety" to teach citizens to help each other, cooperate, abide by discipline, and respect order. We use the meaning of "Justice" to teach citizens to be chivalrous, decisive, responsible, and willing to sacrifice. We use the meaning of "Integrity" to teach citizens to be hardworking, thrifty, distinguish between public and private matters, adhere to their duties, and avoid encroachment. We use the meaning of "Honor" to teach citizens to be self-improving, independent, able to struggle, and know to advance. In this way, using creeds that have deeply ingrained in people's minds for thousands of years to form the qualities that modern citizens must have, then great and small, long and short, can each give their all to achieve the survival and development of the nation. The third thing is, I ask that our education community have a unified direction, a focused goal, and work to truly realize the Three Principles of the People. Since the First National Education Conference in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), when the resolution to promote education based on the Three Principles of the People was passed, ten years have passed. Even from the promulgation of the fundamental principles of education in the 18th year of the Republic of China, ten years have passed. However, before the War of Resistance, our people and youth nationwide had not universally received the education of the Three Principles of the People. Even during the War of Resistance, we still cannot sincerely and consistently believe in the Three Principles of the People. This is certainly a misfortune for the country and also a common shame for our educational administration and the education community. I believe that if the highest principle of revolution and nation-building cannot be universally taught to the people, then the revolution cannot succeed and the nation cannot escape danger. Our education community bears the great responsibility for survival and decline. We must not outwardly comply and inwardly oppose the nation's highest principles. We must not accept them in form while still acting according to our own views and doing things our own way. The responsibility of education is to teach the people. Without trust, the people cannot stand. If the education community first acts contrary to its word, disregards trust and righteousness, and does not value practice, how can we guide the people to unity of purpose and concentration of spirit? We know that the rise and fall of nations, both foreign and ancient, have always existed. Whenever danger is turned into safety, it is always because the intellectuals and the education community of that country, from the midst of conflicting opinions and declining morale, gathered like-minded people, strived for a single goal, and assumed the responsibility of reversing the situation. Now, the War of Resistance has entered its most critical stage. What the enemy fears and wants to attack is our Three Principles of the People for revolutionary nation-saving. If our education community wants to save the country from danger, it must take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as its own responsibility. The Chinese Kuomintang has always eagerly expected enlightened and virtuous people with aspirations to save the country to join the Party and struggle together. Especially during this critical time of national survival, we are even more eager to share the hardships with school principals and professors, who are the enlightened and prescient. The more revolutionary comrades we have, the greater the strength of the War of Resistance. Not only will the cause of saving the nation be easier, but the time of success will also be faster. If we want the revolution to be completed more quickly and the War of Resistance to be victorious sooner, at least we need fellow citizens who bear the responsibility of education to work together with one heart and mind for the Three Principles of the People. Speaking of the effectiveness of education, the Exhortation to Learning chapter of Xunzi says, "The eyes do not see two things clearly, and the ears do not listen to two things attentively to hear clearly." It also says, "When the conduct is unified and the heart is like a knot, the noble person is bound to one." It also explains that the direction of education must be fixed on one target. If one hesitates at the crossroads of four directions, does not look straight at one end, and does not listen attentively to one direction, the result of confusion and bewilderment is that one cannot produce scholars who are brave in learning, committed to practice, and dedicated to saving the country and the people. Now, the country is in a very critical period, and time cannot be wasted. National affairs cannot be delayed any longer. In the past, the lack of steadfastness and the lack of commitment in education have already delayed ten years and caused severe national difficulties. I sincerely hope that our education community will be unified sincerely and genuinely for the sake of the future of the nation and the happiness of the youth of this generation and future generations, "When the conduct is unified and the heart is like a knot." I wish that all the enlightened people in our education community, with one heart and one mind, would share the same aspirations and be determined to gather under the general goal of the Three Principles of the People and work for the Chinese revolution. The hardship and difficulties of our education community itself are deeply understood by the people of the country. Since the War of Resistance, the hardship has doubled and is particularly evident. Our efforts, whether in the war zone, in the occupied areas, or in the rear, are producing the results of the education community's hard work and struggle. I dare say that these labors of cultivation will surely cultivate the fruits of national rejuvenation. What we all hope for is naturally not the rewards of the present but the comfort given to us after the great work of nation-building is accomplished. However, our education community must be self-reliant, self-respecting, single-minded, and with the ambition of cultivating people for a hundred years and the spirit of "if not me, who else," put into practice what I have said above and dedicate our lives to the great cause of saving the country through education. The ancients said, "If one carves and abandons it, rotten wood will not break. If one carves without abandoning it, gold and stone can be engraved." This is the definite principle that those who have the will to succeed will eventually achieve it. I sincerely wish this conference greater success than previous sessions, and I wish our education community immeasurable achievements for the War of Resistance and nation-building. (End)</p>

<h3>Active Guerrilla Activities Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>Beijing and Tianjin</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Tianjin News: Zhang Songqiu's puppet troop team from the suburbs of Tianjin revolted and attacked Beijing. After several days of fierce fighting with the Japanese army, the Japanese army in Beijing has now moved to the outside of the city for defense. Also, there are 3,000 guerrillas in Xiaozhan near Tianjin, posing a significant threat to Tianjin. They have recently been in contact with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Xun News: Our guerrillas have spread extensively in the Xizhimen Mentougou area of Beijing. Because the PingSui and PingHan railways have been repeatedly destroyed and military vehicles have been overturned many times, the Japanese army stationed in Mentougou has been repeatedly attacked. They believe that Yan Shuzhao, the stationmaster of Mentougou Station, the deputy stationmaster, Su Shuqin, and more than 20 other employees are cooperating with the guerrillas. Recently, the Japanese military police arrested Yan and more than 70 employees of Xizhimen Station.</p>
<p>Sanshui</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sihui, 5th] On the 28th of last month, three enemy ships, fully loaded with over a hundred [unclear unit] of bullets, were being transported from Guangzhou to Sanshui via Shitang when they were intercepted by our guerrillas.

They vented their anger on the villages near Shitang, setting fires and killing more than ten villagers before leaving.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 6th] The Japanese Consul General here, Miura, acting on the orders of the Japanese military authorities, notified the leaders of the Shanghai consuls today that the Japanese army will begin attacking the Chinese guerrillas in northern Jiangsu, especially in the vicinity of Huaiyin. Therefore, third-country nationals are warned to evacuate to safe areas to avoid danger. Third-country houses and properties should be prominently marked with large flags of their respective countries on the rooftops to avoid accidental bombing by Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>Eastern Guangdong</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of a part of the Japanese troops from various strongholds in Dongjiang, Shilong, Taiping, and Dongguan, our guerrilla units are taking the opportunity to operate, lurking in the surrounding villages, preparing to attack the Japanese at any time. Zhang Wodong, deputy commander of the Fourth Guerrilla Zone, has ordered the troops of Liu Fayu and Ye Tieliang to be responsible for attacking the Japanese in Dongguan City, and the troops of Mai [unclear] to attack Taiping. Currently, all units have been ordered to reach their destinations, encircling and controlling Shilong, Dongguan City, and Taiping. The various teams are appearing daily on the Dongtai, Donglong, and Baotai highways, as well as the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Japanese. The various puppet maintenance societies and traitors are extremely fearful as the strength of the guerrillas is increasing day by day. Therefore, the maintenance societies in Huangcun, Beipeng, Huaide, Chashan, Xiakou, and other places have mostly disintegrated, and the puppet traitors are fleeing in fear of our executions.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Shanghai, The Great American Evening News reports that gambling dens and large-scale opium dens in the Caoyang area of western Shanghai have recently received warnings from the special task force of the Chinese guerrillas, either in writing or through members who personally visited the dens to instruct them not to be anesthetizing fellow countrymen for the Japanese and indirectly subsidizing the Japanese military, as they have no conscience. If they do not repent and reform, they will be treated the same as traitors. A certain Chen, who had an opium den attached to the Rong Sheng Company gambling den, was even taken to the guerrilla area. As a result, he was released after writing a letter of repentance. The arrival of the guerrillas, even within the Japanese military cordon in the Chinese territory, cannot be resisted by the Japanese puppets.</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the Shanghai Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Manchester Guardian stated today that the Shanghai Municipal Council has handled the Japanese demands to deal with suppression of terrorists very well. If the Municipal Council allows the Japanese police to participate in the public order of the concession, there is also a reason for it, because the elimination of terrorists is beneficial to both parties. There are several points in the agreement that are worth considering. The Japanese side also stated that the "Chinese reactionaries and suspects" will be examined by the Japanese police authorities, which will produce bad results.</p>
<h3>American Pilot Talks About Chongqing's Large Air Raid Shelter</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Correspondence] A reporter was introduced by an engineer yesterday and was able to meet with Mr. Zhan, an American pilot who had just come from Chongqing. The pilot spoke to the reporter about the recent progress of the construction of the great air raid shelter in Chongqing. A brief description is as follows: It is said that when the National Government moved its capital to Chongqing, it was prepared to build the greatest air raid shelter, so that in the event of a large-scale bombing, a place of death could be turned into a peaceful tunnel. This project was started in early August of last year, with more than 100,000 people starting construction. The width of the tunnel is 21 meters, and the height is also 21 meters. The arched ceiling is 10 to 30 meters above the ground and is mostly made of solid rock, so no matter how the soil changes or how heavy the bombs are, it can be safely withstood. There are a total of 20 entrances to the tunnel, with an exit in Guanyin Cave in the west gate. Chongqing has five city gates, and each city gate has an entrance, one in the city center, one in the Central Park, and the rest are accessed by stairs. Another entrance is accessed by elevators. The tunnel is equipped with ten 14-horsepower air pumps, dedicated to supplying fresh air, and a generator, providing electricity. It is also equipped with a radio, with dozens of loudspeakers, which can be used to broadcast news to the people in the tunnel by radio during air raids. The cost of this coordination project is estimated to be more than 700,000 national currency, with 200,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Finance, and the rest borne by the Chongqing Air Defense Command. At present, the excavation of the tunnel has been fully completed, and the ceiling project has also been completed. Only the installation of various machines is currently in progress. In April of this year, the large-scale air raid shelter will be completed. According to the engineer in charge, the shelter will be able to accommodate more than 100,000 people after it is completed.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, [Unclear Day]] Shanghai News: Rugao, Tongzhou, Chongming, and Haizhou in Jiangsu have always been centers of the fishing industry. After the Japanese occupation of Chongming Island, they used it as a base to seize our fishing industry.

<p>French Ambassador Paid a Courtesy Visit to Foreign Minister Wang Yesterday</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th) The newly appointed French Ambassador, Mr. Cosme, made his first courtesy visit to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui today. The *Ta Kung Pao*'s editorial stated, "France should permit the transit of foreign military supplies through Annam to China. China has the right to make this request based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. France should grant this request."</p>
<p>Han × Police Enter the French Concession to Search Residents, Claiming Anti-Japanese Elements Reside There. Chongqing's *Ta Kung Pao* Comments on the Shanghai Situation.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Hankou, 6th) The area adjacent to the French Concession here was under emergency martial law from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The French Concession police authorities searched all residents in the concession and permitted Japanese police to participate in this operation because the Japanese side believes there are anti-Japanese armed elements within the concession.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th) Recent assassinations in Shanghai are considered "terrorist incidents" by the Japanese and neutral parties. Chongqing believes that this is a reasonable patriotic act. *Ta Kung Pao* published an article refuting the *North-China Daily News*' argument that the National Government should suppress such incidents, stating, "Every Chinese citizen has the right, morally and legally, to kill Han traitors. This is not a terrorist incident, but a patriotic act for world peace and justice."</p>
<p>A Righteous Act in Guangzhou: Seizing a Gun, Killing × for National Sacrifice.</p>
<p>(Guangzhou, 6th) Foreign dispatches: Japanese efforts to propagate that Guangzhou has gradually returned to its pre-war state are entirely false. The extent to which Guangzhou is safe, as claimed by the Japanese, can be demonstrated by two recent incidents that occurred on the Shameen Bund, witnessed by foreigners on the opposite bank. In one instance, a Japanese sentry ordered a Chinese person to kowtow, but failing to be completely satisfied, the Chinese person was hung from an electric pole and tortured in various ways for two hours. The second incident was quite inspiring. A French national saw a Japanese sentry insulting a Chinese person without cause. Filled with anger and barely able to endure it, the Chinese person suddenly rushed forward, swiftly seized the Japanese sentry's rifle, and shot him dead. However, the Chinese person was immediately stabbed to death by another sentry.</p>
<p>Visiting the Homes of Soldiers – Zhang Changren</p>
<p>(Correspondence from Yangshuo, Guangxi) I copied the names of nineteen soldiers from this town from the Yangshuo County government, determined to speak with the families of several national defenders.</p>
<p>At a corner in a small alley off Xianqian Street, facing the low city wall along the river, stood a house with six or seven neat stone steps leading to its entrance. In this scholarly family, I found Chen Xiwei's mother, Xi Xin, and his third brother, Xi Gao, who was studying junior high at the county middle school. Xiwei is twenty-eight years old this year and graduated from both a cadre training class and a radio school. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, he voluntarily joined Liao Lei's troops and participated in the war of resistance. I saw his recent letter from Li Huang County, Anhui, which roughly stated: "...I sent two letters to encourage my brother. I am very concerned. I am in good health, so do not worry. I heard that Guilin, Liuzhou, and Pingle have also suffered losses. I hope Brother Xin and the other brothers will quickly build a simple shelter in Shuangtan, our county, to avoid being frightened and to have enough land to cultivate..." Although it was simply written on a sheet of paper, it clearly revealed his enthusiasm for repelling foreign aggression, pacifying the interior, defending the country, and loving his family.</p>
<p>His wife took their young son to her parents' home to celebrate the New Year. I saw his two sons studying at the central elementary school. It is said that the youngest also entered kindergarten. Guangxi Province originally stipulated that each soldier's family could receive 300 catties of preferential rice grain per year, distributed in four installments starting last winter. They have received the equivalent of 75 catties of grain, worth nine Guangxi dollars (4.5 legal tender dollars). His brothers and sons all believe that their brother and father's enlistment is a glorious thing.</p>
<p>The second soldier's family I visited was Zheng Qiaoqiao's elderly father and eldest brother. Their house was outside the city street, surrounded by green vegetable gardens. A worn and slippery cobblestone path passed by the side of their house. They have a vegetable garden now cultivated by his elderly father. His eldest brother is a butcher and does not have the demeanor of a farmer.</p>
<p>Qiaoqiao is the second child in the family, twenty-seven years old this year, and received reserve training. His wife has passed away. His two younger brothers study at the county primary school for free. His enlistment has not significantly affected the family. His elderly father treated me like a familiar friend and said, "Qiaoqiao was first drafted on the fourth day of the eighth month of the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937]. I personally sent him to the north gate of Guilin before returning. Later, he was organized into a team in the county and then went north. I once received a letter from him sent from Hankou. I remember he said: 'We will not only fight to Shanghai, but also fight out of Shanhaiguan,' and told us not to worry. This child has ambition. I heard he has been promoted to platoon leader." He pointed to a house in another vegetable garden east of his house and said, "Xie Si Jiu's son, Xie Qi Jin, is in Qiao Qiao's platoon."</p>
<p>He also told me, "The government is giving preferential treatment (the words "preferential treatment" were spoken particularly clearly) to the families of soldiers. We have already received nine Guangxi dollars. The county magistrate also awarded us Shi Haozi (0.25 legal tender dollars) and some cakes and biscuits." This nearly sixty-year-old gardener happily told me about it. I took the opportunity to compliment him. He suddenly remembered to offer me tea. I thanked him and said, "I still want to go to Xie Qijin's house!" He continued to ask his eldest son to boil tea while sending me out of the garden gate with a smile.</p>
<p>Although Xie Qijin's father also grew vegetables, his family was not as well off as the old gardener who had a butcher son. He had two rooms: one was the main room, which also served as the kitchen, and the other was the bedroom and pigsty. He seemed unwilling to talk to outsiders, and I didn't understand his dialect. After a long time, I learned that Qijin was eighteen years old and not yet married. He was drafted in the eighth month of the year before last and has already received nine Guangxi dollars. According to him, he has not received anything else.</p>
<p>Xie Sijiu, whose eyesight was poor, took out a letter from his son from his pocket. It began with "Grandfather, parents," and ended with "Your younger brother Xie Qijin sends his respects." The gist of the letter was that he was in good health and asked his family not to worry.</p>
<p>As I stepped out of Xie Sijiu's vegetable garden, the peaks on the outskirts of Yangshuo were enveloped in a sea of clouds. The fog was thick, feeling like raindrops on my face. Everywhere it was lush green and pleasing to the eye. Seeing that it was still early, I followed the cobblestone path through the ancient city gate, which resembled a bridge arch and was easily reached by hand, towards the cone-shaped Duxiu Peak. Xie Sijiu told me that Li Qiaosheng's home was at the foot of Duxiu Peak.</p>
<p>Circumnavigating a series of rice paddies, I gradually heard the trickling of water. As the road turned, I saw a stream divided into three tiers, each about a foot high, cascading into a clear pool. The water then flowed under a large rock exposed above the surface, forming a bay and a round-arched bridge. The moss on the bridge stones and the small flowers in the stone crevices seemed to be telling me its ancient history. The water flowing over the bridge made a soft sound, heading towards an unknown place. Stepping across the rocks, Li Qiaosheng's three tile houses and two thatched huts of a lone village were revealed behind the pine trees, bamboo, and some tropical plants. The small bridge, flowing water, and people led me into a spiritual poetic realm. At the same time, it was like seeing Wang Qian's "Mountain Stream and Misty Rain" painting, whose extraordinary scenery evoked thoughts of leaving the mundane world.</p>
<p>I saw a young woman wearing a bamboo hat and carrying buckets heading in the opposite direction. Although I knew she was a member of the lone village, I could not determine if she was Li Qiaosheng's wife. The road entered a fence gate, and a small white dog barked softly behind me as I walked across a small drying ground towards the house.</p>
<p>An old woman with white hair welcomed me, an unexpected guest, with surprise. She admitted to being Li Qiaosheng's maternal grandmother and was warming herself by a fire on the floor in the main room, using pine firewood. The pine firewood was still damp, emitting a pungent white smoke. I pulled up a low stool and sat by the fire, asking about Li Qiaosheng's family. She then told me that Qiaosheng's mother had gone to the market to sell vegetables, and Qiaosheng's wife had gone out to collect pig feed because the family raised two pigs. "Didn't you meet her?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I wanted to talk to her, but I didn't dare to ask rashly. Can you please call her back?" I said softly.</p>
<p>She said, "Okay!" and hurriedly ran out of the house, standing outside the fence gate, calling out in a loud, clear voice like a middle-aged woman. Immediately, another loud voice also called out. Thanks to the echoes from the surrounding mountains. The kind old woman only called out three times and brought her grandson's wife back.</p>
<p>Li Qiaosheng's wife left the carrying pole on the drying ground. Like a simple peasant woman, she followed the old grandmother into the main room. She took off the large, round, yellow and shiny bamboo hat, revealing her head wrapped in blue floral cloth. With a fair face, slender eyebrows, and a pair of solemn eyes, she was a rarely seen beautiful peasant woman in Guangxi. Her ample chest indicated that she had a child to nurse, and her bare legs with rolled up blue pants and bare feet showed her strength and diligence like other Guangxi peasant women. When asked about her husband, she hesitated to speak, but fortunately, the old grandmother relayed my questions one by one, and she slowly answered me.</p>
<p>Li Qiaosheng is her husband. Twenty-seven years old this year, he enlisted after marriage and has been in the army for five full years. Before last year's "June" [should be July] Marco Polo Bridge Incident (she knew about it), the troops from this province went to the north and stayed at home in Yangshuo for three days. Now there is a mother, sister, maternal grandmother, and a son who is almost two years old.</p>
<p>"Has Qiaosheng written recently?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yes!" and went into a dark room, returning with two "worn-out" letters, saying, "The most recent one was sent to the county government." (Later I learned that the Guangxi Provincial Government had ordered each county to collect exemplary letters from soldiers' families.) "These are letters from the year before last and July last year." I saw that the first letter was addressed to "Li Jv Sheng's mother." Inside it said, "Soldiers have certificates that exempt them from all civilian labor fees. If the township office asks you to do civilian labor, show them the certificate. I am strong, so don't worry." (Original text) The second letter was from "An Yuan Rear Hospital No. 62, Pingxiang, Jiangxi." He was undoubtedly "injured" in battle, but the letter did not mention it, only saying that he was in good health, and his wife still didn't know about it.</p>
<p>"Do you feel like the family is missing a helper since your husband enlisted?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It's okay. We can all still manage. I had a child last year, so we had to hire a worker. A few days ago, our hired worker was also drafted to participate in guerrilla training and will be back in a month or two!"</p>
<p>"Do you often think of your husband?"</p>
<p>She smiled and remained silent. The old grandmother interjected, "Of course she does! Even I, when I think of that good grandson, couldn't eat anything on New Year's Eve."</p>
<p>I comforted them, saying, "We will soon drive out the Japanese ××. In one or two years at most, you can reunite as a family and live peacefully in this beautiful landscape." They all smiled.</p>
<p>I then asked about "preferential treatment." Li Qiaosheng's wife became excited and told me, "At the end of last year, I received nine Guangxi dollars, and the county magistrate even personally sent Raba [rice cakes] and biscuits here." She pointed to the red paper strip with "Glorifying the Nation" written on it above the central door of the main room and said, "He even put this glorious strip of paper for us!"</p>
<p>Seeing that the mountain scenery in front of the door was gradually darkening, I said goodbye. From the dark room came the sound of an infant crying. I asked this young mother to quickly take care of the child, but I couldn't refuse the old grandmother's hospitality, and she sent me out of the fence. As I walked across the rock in the middle of the stream, I turned back for a final glance at the lone village at the foot of Duxiu Peak. She was still standing there, Li Qiaosheng's wife holding a chubby son close to her. The little white dog wagged its short tail at their feet. I waved my hand to ask them to go inside. The cobblestone path turned a bend, and the rain-drenched forest obscured them from view.</p>

<p>England and America Discuss Imposing Economic Pressure on Japan; England is Studying Restrictions on Japanese Goods Imports; Loans to Strengthen Our Resistance</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 5th) According to a *Daily Telegraph* diplomatic correspondent, the Spanish issue is nearing its end. British authorities' attention is now focused on the Sino-Japanese conflict. The British government's loan to China is noteworthy. This loan will be used to maintain China's currency, combat Japan's destructive plans, and strengthen China's resistance. The amount is approximately £3 million to £5 million. In recent weeks, London and Washington have been constantly discussing methods of directly imposing economic pressure on Japan. Japan's war effort requires certain war materials. Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have the power to suppress Japan regarding the supply of these materials. Last July, Britain considered lending China a substantial sum of £20 million and planned to use various methods of British loans. Since the United States provided China with a credit loan of £5.3 million last December, the British government is also preparing to take active steps in the Far East. This indicates that the British government will handle the world's troublesome war issues with a more decisive spirit. In short, Britain is now cooperating with other friendly countries, preparing to suppress aggressor countries to maintain peace, and using its vast financial resources to achieve this goal. It is not difficult for Britain to restrict the market for certain important Japanese export goods, but all territories of the British Empire must unanimously agree. Effective implementation of this measure may take a longer time. London is currently hiring experts to study all aspects of this issue so that the government can make a final decision based on all necessary information. The British Cabinet considered the proposal to lend money to China last July but did not pass it because it believed that such a move would be viewed as unfriendly by Japan, given the crisis in Europe at the time.</p>
<p>Soviet-Japanese Fishing Dispute Intensifies; Rumors of Japanese Military Steps</p>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence) The authorities here are fully prepared for the necessary steps to be taken after the failure of the Soviet-Japanese fisheries negotiations. One hundred and fifty fishing boats and 20,000 fishermen are waiting in Hakodate, northern Japan, to set sail for their first fishing trip in April. Regardless of the outcome of future Soviet-Japanese fisheries negotiations, these fishermen are determined to uphold their so-called "rights obtained in the Russo-Japanese War" and set off to fish in Soviet territorial waters during the upcoming fishing season. The local press believes that Foreign Minister Arita's instructions to the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union on the 16th of last month were a final warning to the Soviet authorities that unless the Soviet Union changes its attitude, the Japanese government will be forced to take necessary steps to protect its rights. Tanaka, the president of the North Sea Fisheries Company, previously stated: "We cannot abandon our legal rights in the North Sea for a moment. We are still awaiting instructions from the government, but we will not cede an inch of our fishing grounds in eastern Siberia. If forced to take decisive action in the future, all fishing boats will set sail as scheduled." It is reported that there are 386 fishing areas in eastern Siberia, covering approximately 6,000 hectares, and approximately 20,000 residents of northern Japan are engaged in fishing in this area. Japanese people have been fishing in this area for many years. The fish caught in this area each year are worth approximately 50 million yen, of which approximately 30 million is canned and shipped abroad, and the remainder is used to supply domestic demand in Japan. The fishing grounds near the coasts of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea are the most valuable in the entire area. During the flood season, the fresh fish pouring in from the rivers is the largest source of harvest. Canning factories have been established in the aforementioned areas. Those with inside information doubt whether Japan can carry out operations in these fishing grounds, as it is not easy for Japanese naval vessels to provide protection under Soviet opposition. The Japanese ambassador is currently negotiating with the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee in Moscow. If negotiations fail, how Japan will safeguard its "rights" remains a secret from the Japanese naval authorities. However, according to rumors, the Japanese authorities have sent a fleet of light cruisers to concentrate in northern Korea, preparing to respond to the situation. In the Diet, members of the National Alliance have urged the authorities to prepare to forcibly occupy northern Sakhalin if the Soviet Union shows no possibility of compromise. This area is rich in coal and oil, and Japan has coveted it for several years.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence) Japanese newspapers believe that the recent reduction of the Soviet Embassy in Japan, given the current tense relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, is an ominous sign. Currently, the Soviet Embassy has only two officials left: the Chargé d'Affaires (Smetanin) and the Second Secretary (Annalov). It is said that Smetanin will also return to his country soon. Two years ago, the Soviet Embassy had a staff of fourteen, including a Commercial Counselor, a Counselor, a Naval Attaché, an Assistant Attaché, a Japanese Secretary, and six Secretaries. Soviet-Japanese relations have been poor in recent years, but since this spring, repeated disputes have occurred on the Soviet-Manchurian border, coupled with the stalemate in the Northern Ocean fisheries issue, further exacerbating the poor relations.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th) Tokyo reports that the 48 Japanese fishermen arrested by the Soviet Union last year have been released and returned to Japan on a Japanese ship from Vladivostok yesterday morning. These 48 people were arrested on September 13th and October 27th last year for encroaching on Soviet territorial waters along the coast of the Soviet Union. Their fishing boats were also detained. After being punished, the fishermen were deported.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 6th) Several bloody conflicts have occurred continuously in the northern part of the Suifen River on the Soviet-Manchurian border in the past two days. According to Japanese reports, Soviet troops crossed the border to attack puppet Manchurian troops. It is reported that 15 Soviet soldiers were killed or wounded, and 5 puppet Manchurian soldiers were wounded. Soviet reinforcements arrived to rescue them but were eventually repelled by the puppet Manchurian troops. The puppet Manchurian government has protested to the Soviet Consul General in Shengjing.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated, "The Japanese government is not paying attention to the recent conflicts on the Soviet-Manchurian border because we are already tired of border conflicts."</p>
<p>The U.S. Prepares to Store Large Quantities of Rubber; The Military and the Market are Holding Discussions</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 6th) Reports from the United States state that the U.S. Army Department and market representatives are currently holding talks to prepare for storing large quantities of rubber domestically. The *Financial Times* reprinted this report today and commented, "The United States has a legislative provision that allocates US$100 million over the next four years to develop important raw materials. This proposal to store rubber must be prompted by this provision. The purpose is to store 200,000 to 300,000 tons of rubber. It is said that these negotiations are currently exploratory in nature. If it is implemented, London intends to request the cooperation of the International Rubber Committee to stabilize the market."</p>

<p>The Spanish Government Reorganizes the Army and Decides to Fight to the End; National Defense Council Leader Casado Broadcasts, Seeking Peace Based on Independence and Freedom</p>
<p>(Reuters, Madrid, 5th) Today, the Spanish government's Ministry of National Defense issued a decree reorganizing the government army, with Prime Minister Negrin as the supreme commander. This decision indicates that the government army has decided to fight to the end. The decree states that the current situation necessitates the reorganization of the armies in the central and southern regions. These armies and those established in the future will be directly commanded by Prime Minister Negrin and directed by the General Staff. In addition, the conscription of 44- and 45-year-old soldiers was dissolved, and several new positions were announced, the most notable of which was the temporary appointment of General Gomez, commander of the Central War Zone, as Chief of Staff. Dr. Negrin will give a national broadcast tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Madrid, 6th) It is rumored that Prime Minister Negrin, who was appointed as the supreme commander of the Spanish army, has left here by plane after being dismissed by the National Defense Council led by Casado.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Madrid, 6th) General Casado, leader of the National Defense Council, gave a radio address to the Spanish people in the Franco-controlled area this morning, expressing his desire for peace, stating, "The people in the Republican territory are eager for peace based on independence and freedom. We seek a free nation, free from all foreign forces and other imperial ambitions. If you are willing to make peace, we will respond. If you continue to fight us, we will swear to fight to the end." After his speech, General Casado requested General Miaja to accept the position of Chairman of the National Defense Council. It is reported that General Miaja has apparently agreed, as Casado has informed the leaders of all army corps of this matter.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Madrid, 5th) An official announcement stated that the rebellion in the Port of Cartagena has been suppressed. Pro-rebel elements suddenly seized the Cartagena radio station today and broadcast that the city had surrendered. The radio station was immediately retaken by government troops. A broadcast this evening stated that several rebel personnel had been killed and denied that the city had surrendered, stating that everything had returned to normal and that the people of Cartagena were cheering for the government. The official announcement praised their loyalty and perseverance and stated that such rebel elements were being subjected to military law trials. "At this critical moment, when unity and obedience are urgently needed, to plot internal strife and harm the Republic is an act that must be punished."</p>

<p>Franco's Declaration: Negotiations with Germany and Italy, Guaranteeing Spanish Independence</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 5th) The *Sunday Chronicle* published a declaration today in Franco's name, stating, "Today is truly the eve of my final victory. I wish to inform the world of the future of Spain. This is my privilege and obligation. I must clarify one thing: neither Germany nor Italy has demanded territory or the construction of military bases from Spain. I have negotiated with Germany and Italy, establishing agreements guaranteeing the establishment of Spain for Spaniards. Our current difficult task is to build this new Spain on our new land. We do not harbor hatred towards anyone. My 1.32 million prisoners of war will be able to understand my benevolence. We have not mistreated these prisoners in any way. We have no thoughts of revenge or resentment. I make this clear to the world, as it is very important, because a victory without friendship is empty. We need the sympathy and understanding of all countries in the world, especially Britain, and we also need the friendship of Spaniards who were previously my enemies. My current difficult task is to convince those people that our ideals are extremely sincere and honest, and that we share the same ideals despite being on opposing sides.</p>
<p>Ignoring Factional Leaders; Immediately Rebuilding Spain; Needing the Sympathy of the Whole World</p>
<p>"We do not care who the factional leaders are. My spirit is the spirit of Spain. Spain will not allow the development of private ambitions. I will immediately rebuild Spain according to the following plan: (1) Building Houses: We will build 100,000 to 200,000 houses in a short period. The construction costs will be paid from Spain's own money. We will not ask for help from others to realize this plan. Spain has its own resources that can be used. The world should understand this point. When we can utilize various resources, Spain will be prosperous and happy. (2) Improving People's Health: I have begun to build large-scale hospitals and sanatoriums. Impoverished working-class families can receive government subsidies. We will also pay attention to the general wage issue, ensuring that everyone's income is sufficient to cover their daily life. (3) Intensifying Production and Promoting Trade: We want to increase production and must pay attention to agriculture. I have launched irrigation projects for dry land. The above are the general outlines of my plan. I desperately need the sympathy and friendship of the whole world to implement this plan."</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Paris, 6th) According to sources, four Spanish planes carrying 30 passengers flew from Candana, Spain, to the Alan Airport in Algiers, North Africa, last night. However, French authorities declined to disclose whether the passengers were subordinates of Franco or Negrin. Most of the news about the revolution in Candana carried in French newspapers this morning is contradictory. Some say that the revolutionaries have already lost, while others say that several government agencies in the area were still in the hands of the Nationalists late last night.</p>
<p>Italian Air Force Moves to North Africa; French Officers Also Hold Military Meetings; Poncet Immediately Departs for Paris</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Milan, 6th) Units of the Italian Mediterranean Air Force stationed in Sicily have been ordered to move to Tripoli, North Africa. They were transported there yesterday by the aircraft carrier "Giuseppe Miraglia." It is said that the ship and the aircraft will be docked there during the exhibition in Tripoli.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Paris, 6th) According to reports here this morning, the commander-in-chief of the French army in North Africa and the Governor-General of Morocco, General Noguès, held a military meeting in Tunis. Those participating included Vice Admiral Billard, commander of the French fleet stationed in Bizerte, General Baumgartner, commander of the 19th Infantry Division, General Testart, commander of the 5th Air Wing, Generals Giraud and Hocquart, who recently arrived from Marseille, and commanders stationed in Algiers and Tunis. In addition, the defense line in southern Tunisia will begin to be inspected on the 6th. At the same time, the Governor-General of Tunisia, Labonne, will also depart for Sousse, Sfax, and Kairouan to inspect.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Rome, 5th) According to confirmed sources, French Ambassador to Italy Poncet will return to Paris on the 6th. It is said that this trip is purely personal in nature, but he will visit the Foreign Minister and other cabinet members after returning to his country. As for the rumors that the ambassador has received instructions from the government to seek an exchange of opinions between France and Italy, there is no truth to it.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Tunis, 6th) At the suggestion of the French authorities, the Tunisian government has banned several Italian-language newspapers, Italian-language books, and Arabic newspapers printed in Damascus.</p>
<p>German Aviation Minister Goering Visits Italy; Goebbels Denigrates Democratic Countries; Gayda Also Attacks British Military Expansion</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, San Remo, Italy, 5th) German Aviation Minister General Goering and his wife arrived here by car today. Local officials and thousands of German celebrities welcomed them at the station. In order to allow Goering to enjoy a quiet trip, the local government decided to forgo all welcome ceremonies and banquets, and only lined the streets to pay their respects.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 5th) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech today at the opening of the Leipzig Trade Fair, strongly expressing Germany's dissatisfaction with the world's distribution of natural resources. In his denunciation of democratic countries, he said that the vast wealth of Britain in particular made him feel most unfair. It is said that Germany's economic program is absolutely common sense. Germany must survive and will certainly survive. It is impossible to ignore a nation of 80 million people located in the heart of Europe, and it is not a good strategy to knowingly divide all the people into "rich" and "poor" without seeking to adjust and improve the situation. Therefore, all actions aimed at hindering Germany's commercial development, even if not criminal, must be foolish actions.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Rome, 5th) Gayda attacked Britain in an article in the *Italian People's Voice* today, stating, "Britain's military expansion has gone beyond a defensive nature and is approaching an open preparation for war. Chamberlain's approach to negotiating for peace has shifted to using threats to extort peace. We can conclude that in a few months, after its military equipment is fully equipped, Britain's rhetoric will be even further removed from the atmosphere of peace. Therefore, at present, Italy has no choice but to engage in military expansion."</p>
<p>New Belgian Cabinet Still Difficult to Form</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Brussels, 6th) Hopes for the formation of a new Belgian cabinet are slim. As of yesterday afternoon, Acting Prime Minister Pierlot attempted to form a cabinet combining Catholics and Socialists, but to no avail. It is reported that Pierlot met with the Queen of Belgium yesterday and convened a cabinet meeting at 6:00 PM to discuss the dissolution of parliament and the holding of general elections. Later, the meeting was postponed for three hours, and Pierlot again met with the King, reportedly to suggest the dissolution of parliament to the King.</p>
<p>Indian Governor-General Suspends Trip to Rajkot; Dispute Over Reform Issues; Bhansali Appointed as Mediator</p>
<p>(Reuters, New Delhi, 5th) Indian Governor-General Lord Linlithgow has decided to suspend his tour of Rajkot and will arrive here tomorrow morning. This news has drawn significant attention from political figures, who believe that there will be a major development in tomorrow's events. Reuters has learned from reliable sources that important representatives of the State Council are negotiating with Linlithgow to end the dispute over the Rajkot reform issue, so that Gandhi can end his fast. Gandhi's friend Bhansali may represent the State Council. It is widely believed that he will submit a concrete proposal to the Indian Governor-General to resolve the dispute. Bhansali also served as a mediator in the previous dispute. Today, the Rajkot Gazette stated that Gandhi's blood pressure had risen from 168 to 180, and he had lost two pounds. He slept restlessly at night. Gandhi's wife, who had been participating in public resistance since February 3rd, had been imprisoned in a detention camp near Rajkot. Today, the authorities transported her to Gandhi's location. It is not known whether she has been released by the authorities. Gandhi ordered his wife to return to her detention camp this evening.</p>
<p>Guam Fortification Plan: Vinson States that it Will Not Be Submitted Temporarily</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Washington, 6th) According to U.S. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Vinson, the Guam fortification issue will not be submitted at this time. According to Vinson's words, the Guam fortification issue has been temporarily shelved.</p>
<p>Egyptian and Iranian Consulates Upgraded; Egyptian Envoy to Iran</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Cairo, 6th) The father of Egyptian Queen Farida, Zulficar, will go to Tehran, the capital of Iran, as the first ambassador. Yesterday, the two countries announced that the Egyptian consulate in Tehran and the Iranian consulate in Cairo had been upgraded to embassies.</p>
<p>Short Commentary: "Long Live All Female Compatriots Across the Country"</p>
<p>"Long live all female compatriots across the country!" This was the slogan shouted by Chairman Chiang at the Women's Donation Day (March 5th) speech during the Chongqing donation campaign. This slogan illustrates how enthusiastic the women in Chongqing are about donating, making our leader so happy that he shouted it out loud! It turned out that on this day, over two thousand women from all walks of life participated in the women's donation, and the total amount of donations reached 700,000, which not only broke the banking sector's donation record on March 4th but also shattered the erroneous concept of Chinese women for thousands of years. Therefore, in his speech on that day, Chairman Chiang also said: "I have always firmly believed in the strength of my female compatriots, which is greater than that of my male compatriots. This has been clearly proven today, and their strength is double that of men."</p>
<p>This glorious action of one thousand women in Chongqing not only lifted the spirits of women throughout China, not only gave infinite comfort to the soldiers at the front, but also made people all over the world understand that Chinese women also firmly believe in the inevitable victory of their resistance and that China's unlimited latent power will be a reliable guarantee of final victory. Therefore, it will win greater international sympathy, belief, and assistance!</p>
<p>There are at least four to five hundred thousand female compatriots in Hong Kong. If one-tenth of them could participate in the donation, there would be forty to fifty thousand people. If the proportion of Chongqing women is followed, the result should be 15 million yuan. Even if it is reduced to one-tenth, it should be 1.5 million yuan! Moreover, the lives of female compatriots in Chongqing are generally much poorer than those of women in Hong Kong!</p>

<p>SPORTS NEWS The Football Association Discussed Many Important Matters Yesterday</p>
<p>Shanghai Requests Hong Kong to Send a Team North in November to Complete the Port City Competition. This Saturday's Silver Shield Semi-Final Replay Ends in a Draw; Replay the Following Day.</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at around 5 o'clock, the Football Association held its March regular meeting. Chairman Brett, Secretary Gordon North, and committee members Huang Jiajun, Jian Jin, and others attended.</p>
<p>After the secretary read the agenda, the chairman reported on various matters:</p>
<p>(1) The Hong Kong-Philippines Port City Football Match generated a total ticket revenue of $12,914.90. (All expenses for hosting the Philippine team were covered by this amount. After deducting expenses, the association still had a net profit of $3,200.)</p>
<p>(2) The Governor's Cup Quarter-Final the day before yesterday had ticket revenue of $2,774.20. (After deducting all necessary expenses, the remaining amount will be divided equally between the association and the federation.)</p>
<p>(3) In the recent Group B League match between Guanghua and Kowloon Club, Guanghua player Wen Huagen and Kowloon Club player Gao Lushi were penalized by the referee for indecent behavior and ordered off the field. The emergency committee members held a meeting and decided to punish them by disqualifying both players from competition until December 31st of this year.</p>
<p>After the chairman finished his report, he continued to present the following discussion items and resolutions:</p>
<p>(1) The chairman stated that Mr. Cream, the former chairman of the Shanghai Western Football League, is currently in Hong Kong and deeply regrets that the Hong Kong-Shanghai Port City competition cannot continue. If the Hong Kong side needs any assistance in holding the Hong Kong-Shanghai Port City competition, the Shanghai Football League is very willing to help and is already prepared to do so. Mr. Cream's intention is that the Shanghai Football League has expressed its cooperation with the Hong Kong Football Association to make the resumption of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Port City competition possible. It is hoped that the Hong Kong side can consider sending a team to Shanghai in November for the competition. Secretary Gordon North continued the chairman's speech, saying that in February of this year, the Hong Kong Football Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Football League, stating that it was unable to send a team north for the competition, but said that if circumstances permit, it would send a team to Shanghai in November. Subsequently, the committee members passed a resolution to submit this matter to the new officials of the Football Association for 1939-1940, urging them to consider sending a team to Shanghai in November for the 1938-1939 Port City competition, and at the same time inviting the Shanghai team to Hong Kong for the competition in February 1940.</p>
<p>(2) It was resolved to accept the invitation from Macau to select players from the intermediate group to represent Hong Kong in a Port City competition in Macau on April 16th. The selection of personnel will be the responsibility of the management committee.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding sending a team to the Philippines for a Port City competition, it was resolved to set the date for departure on April 28th on the President Cleveland ship and return to Hong Kong from the Philippines on the Pacific ship on May 10th. The selection of personnel will be the responsibility of the management committee. The committee will hold a meeting next Wednesday to discuss everything (the matter of sending a team to Macau will also be discussed at this meeting).</p>
<p>(4) The final date of the Lihua Cup was originally scheduled for April 2nd, but it coincided with the Singapore Chinese team coming to Hong Kong for a competition. Therefore, it was resolved to advance the final to 3:30 PM on March 26th at the Hong Kong Stadium, with the Chinese League team playing against the Western Civil Servants League team. The Secretary of Vehicle Administration, Shi Mei (President of the Association), will present the awards at that time.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the second Xuhe Cup competition, it was resolved to hold it on April 15th. As for the competing teams and the venue, it will be decided by the competition committee jointly formed by the South China, Army, and Navy associations.</p>
<p>(6) It was resolved that if the special Silver Shield semi-final between South China South and Eastern this Saturday (the 11th) ends in a draw within the prescribed game time and extra time, a replay will be held the following day (Sunday), because this year's tournament is limited to the end of April and cannot be delayed any further.

<p>Points to Note When Teaching General Exercises By Zhuoyue</p>
<p>General exercises are, in our minds, too common – anyone can do them, and anyone can teach them. Because they are so common, many things are overlooked when teaching them – some are harmful to physiology, some fail to ensure that all parts of the students' bodies develop evenly, some affect posture, and some hinder the teaching process. I will now briefly list what I have seen below in the hope that comrades will study and correct them. If they are correct, we can earnestly reform them.</p>
<p>A. Strictness is the only essential element for physical education instructors. High teaching efficiency is the result of strictness. Unfortunately, most physical education instructors in the past came from the ranks of athletes. Because of the habits they themselves have developed, they are arrogant, romantic, and casual, and they don't know how to teach or even understand the meaning of teaching. So even when they become teachers, they don't know what to do. They only follow their past habits – a spirit of casualness, arrogance, and letting the students do as they please… As for those who are outsiders to sports, they are even more at a loss. I am not denigrating any part of the physical education instructors here, but telling us the facts. I believe that the current physical education comrades will also feel it. When I think back to my six years as a senior high school student, I clearly had more than five or six people instructing me, but I never met one who suited me. They were always casual and let the students control themselves. What I saw in neighboring schools was the same everywhere. In fact, when we are in class, there should be an instructor – strict, this strictness must be revealed in attitude and indirectly influence the students, so that the students can be moved and obey.</p>
<p>B. Discipline – When we are teaching, there should be a publicly observed discipline, and students should never be allowed to do as they please. Because discipline is the teacher's weapon. Without discipline, the teacher cannot impart knowledge to the students. Because there is no discipline when teaching, students cannot be made to concentrate on learning and study hard, which leads to a reduction in teaching efficiency, or even to zero. So discipline is the second thing that we physical education comrades should pay attention to. Regarding discipline, it can be stipulated according to the needs of various aspects, but the principle is civic training.</p>
<p>C. Commands – The "command" for teaching physical education should be as important as the matter itself. Often, many coaches cause students to look down on them because their commands are not dignified and magnificent. Because commands represent personal spirit and dignity, if the command is not appropriate, personal spirit and dignity will be lost, and at the same time, students will have a contemptuous heart. Therefore, commands are very important for physical education instructors. The issuing of commands should have a considerable "after-command," the sound should be clear and magnificent, and the rhythm of "movement" and "after-command" should be clear. But when issuing commands, one should stand in an appropriate place, stand at attention first, and then issue the command.</p>

<p>Good Football Matches Again This Week South China South vs. Eastern Fight for Silver Shield Final Spot</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] This week's football schedule is also very rich, and several games are quite important for the championship. For example, in tomorrow's (8th) Group A League match between South China Hua and Junhai, if South China Hua can win or draw, it will indirectly benefit their elder brother South China South. But I predict that it will be difficult for South China Hua to win, and it will not be easy to draw. In the end, I am afraid that a defeat is inevitable. In the special Silver Shield semi-final between South China South and Eastern on Saturday (11th), because they are both Chinese teams, there is no need to discuss the issue of victory or defeat beforehand. Therefore, although it is of great importance, both sides should try their best to go all out, and let's see who will win the final right. The Group B League match between South China and Shige is the biggest key to whether South China can win the championship. If South China wins, then the future is bright and they can steadily win the championship. If they lose or draw, the championship situation will change greatly. Because Middlesex has the same points as the Fifth Battalion Artillery after defeating them, but South China is now only one point ahead of these two teams. Therefore, because the scores are close, South China must beat Shige. The schedule for this week's games is as follows:</p>

The second week of finals is the critical moment for the selected teams to win the championship, and the results are bound to be even more impressive. Unfortunately, the person in charge of the stadium did not agree to continue lending the stadium for the charitable event, so it has been suspended for a long time and has not been able to be held.

It is scheduled to hold an executive committee meeting at the secretariat at 8:00 PM today to discuss the progress.</p>

<p>Chinese Walking Association Prepares for World Games Walking Race Will Participate in 50,000-Meter and 10,000-Meter Events</p>
<p>[Shanghai News] The Chinese Ministry of Education has decided to participate in the World Games to be held in Helsinki in 1940. In the previous session, the Chinese Walking Association of this city was in charge of selecting four knights, Cai Zhengyi, Zhou Yuyu, Zhang Zaojiu, and Zheng Chengshan, to go to Germany to compete. Cai Zhengyi won 19th place among more than 80 athletes from more than 20 countries. According to Lu Wenxia, a member of the Chinese Walking Association, he told reporters yesterday that we are determined to send personnel to participate in this World Games. Therefore, last year the Association continued to organize the Fifth Chinese Open Walking Race as a preparation for joining. Now, in addition to issuing orders to members to intensify their hard training, it is also sending letters to Zhang Zaojiu and Cai Zhengyi, who are currently staying in Hong Kong, to prepare as soon as possible. Currently, there are more and more people practicing walking in this city, and the phenomenon of past prosperity has been restored. Lu also said that this World Games will participate in the 50,000-meter and the newly added 10,000-meter events. The number of athletes may increase to six, but it will depend on the situation. As for the selection location, it has not yet been determined whether it will be in Shanghai or elsewhere.</p>
<p>A Record of the Keyi Middle School Football Team's Trip to Macau (4) By Liu Dianguang</p>
<p>After arriving at the venue, the time for the match was approaching. The spectators gathered one after another, filling the area with hardly any space to stand. The scene was exceptionally lively with both men and women in attendance. It was calculated that the small football match would be held at the New Port Stadium at 3:00 PM, the basketball match against Lingnan Branch School at 4:00 PM, and the match against the Macau Army School SOS team at 5:00 PM, all held at the Lingnan Branch School Stadium. A team directly playing three consecutive matches also broke the record of the ball game. Before 3:00 PM, both sides were already dressed and trying out their skills. When the referee blew his silver whistle, the coin was tossed to choose the position. We set up our formation with our backs to the sun, but the headwind was quite strong, which put us at a disadvantage. With the sound of the horn, the opponent took the offensive first. The ball was moved from under the center forward's feet, with the left and right sides echoing each other. Our side, Tang Linghan, used his skills to intercept the ball halfway and sent it to Gu Jiaju from afar, who transported it to the front. Li Xianbin, a borderlander, and Weisheng, a partner, used their great swords and axes to break through three lines of defense and forced their way into the Lianlian's hinterland. Tang Linghan calmly swept the ground, and the ball went straight into the net, opening the scoring. After our side scored, our morale was high. Ruan Zhenbang galloped across the field, bravely winning the three armies. From then on, the ball often hovered in the Lianlian team's territory, with dangerous situations all around. Linghan sat in the center, leading the three armies to attack Lianlian. Xianbin started an uprising on the border, secretly crossed Chencang, and secretly passed it to Linghan, who sent it forward with one kick. Jiaju caught up and topped it off, and our side scored another goal. The opponent reorganized its troops, and one man alone broke into our camp. Yuzhuang came out to greet him, but the ball reached the center, and the opponent hijacked it halfway. Shot from across the goal, I wanted to hold it with my hand, but unexpectedly, the ball was too high and my hand was too short, so I sent a goal. The first half ended with a score of two to one. After the break, Weisheng raised the flag on the northern road and went deep into the barren land. The opponent transferred troops, and Zhenbang's resistance failed. Linghan dropped his gun, and Jiaju's foot was effective. Returned the property to its owner, sent it forward, Jiaju fired from the right, as fast as a fly. The opponent's center guard didn't want to hijack it halfway, but unfortunately his horse lost its footing, and the second pass fell. His goalkeeper扑地抢救, escaped from danger at the touch of a hair. The situation changed, and artillery fire rained down, galloping back and forth, extremely tense. Weisheng alone retreated three heroes, but unexpectedly Yuzhuang opened the door to invite thieves. Baoqi ordered the eviction of guests, Zhenbang pushed it to the center, and the headwind turned into a peacemaker. After that, Lianlian once launched a fierce attack. In front of our goal, there were mad waves. Master Han made a famous teacher and made every effort to escape. Unexpectedly, the other party was still ghostly, mixed into our hinterland, and went straight to the depths of the dragon's gate. Yuzhuang went out far, and was deceived by him through three passes, and sent away another goal. After that, both sides tried to win again, but time did not allow it. In the sound of the flute, the two sides drew two to two. Our lineup is as follows: Ying Maiqi, Yang Yuzhuang, Chen Weisheng, Yuan Zhenbang, Li Xianbin, Tang Linghan, Gu Jiaju The basketball game with the Army SOS team was the most exciting. The referee was Mr. Li Lianying. The school's male and female cheerleaders cheered from the side. At 4:18, the war broke out. When the referee blew his silver whistle, our side, Yang Yuzhuang, went straight in alone, giving the Army team a dismount. Center Liao Douqi reappeared, taking the lead with four to zero. Army team's left forward, Yi Yundao, saw that the situation was not good, and his five claws flew together, and he actually caught up and tied the score. Ruan Zhenbang was careless and violated the rules. Yi Yundao took the penalty, and with a scream, the ball went into the net. The Army team then overtook by one point. Lin Guohong caused trouble on the front line, and Ruan Zhenbang redeemed himself. At this time, the Army soldiers were furious, chasing each other all over the field. Chen Xinqiu flicked his hand in the middle, and Liao Baoqi was happy to see the prey, imitated it, and made another contribution. The first half ended, and our side took the lead with ten to four. After a one-minute break, Li Bin temporarily retired to the back defense, and Wu Lihan came on the stage to fight. The Army team also replaced new troops. Sure enough, Wu Lihan did not disgrace his mission, and soon occupied a city. The other side, John, returned the color, Chen Xinqiu was like a phoenix among people, a dragon among horses, like a lion迎风, using all his skills. Lu Chongli, Chen Weisheng also rode横刀,威振八方, both托连中两彩under the basket. Liao Baoqi led the generals to seize the camp and kill. Lin Guohong rose up on the border, not showing any mercy. He jumped up and grabbed two points. Yi Yundao带球闯, our side Bao Daji was stolen by him a goal, unwilling to retire, Gu Jiaju took the stage, Chen Xinqiu from beginning to end, put on an ice-cold face, and Lu Chongli, Yang Yuzhuang, 搭一挡, 一打一唱,予取予携, Chen Xinqiu, Lu Cheli, Chen Weisheng, Yang Yuzhuang, Lin Guoxiong, Ruan Zhenbang, etc., made the greatest contribution to the victory in the two games today. In the first game against Lingnan Branch School, the total score was forty-five to twenty-nine. In the second game against the Army team, forty-five to thirty-six. Our side won both games. After the war, the sky was already dark, and we had dinner. In the evening, everyone was free to go out and tour. Within ten steps, the stalls were lined up, and the electric lights were shining brightly, as bright as day. Where will this consumption be compensated from? If a gambler can think about it, he should return with regret. (End)</p>

<p>Free Talk Ma City Riverside By Li Huiying</p>
<p>The Ma City River is in the suburbs of Ma City. The water is clear and spotless, rushing from the distant Dabie Mountains, passing through mountains and valleys. When it reaches the plains near Ma City, it flows steadily, like a mirror. Green trees line the banks, shrouded in mist like a bottomless net, with the fragrance of rice and a fresh, cool air floating everywhere.</p>
<p>The river is not deep, but the surface is wide, resembling a large river. In the middle of the river, there are exposed sand dunes in groups of three or five, like islands. There are no bridges or ferries, and if you want to cross the river, you have to take off your shoes and socks and wade through the water.</p>
<p>On the shore, there are three or five shops selling sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and soybean milk. The buns are steaming hot. Three or four comrades who arrived earlier are eating and resting.</p>
<p>On the walls, there are various slogans and propaganda cartoons. This is propaganda work in the suburbs. Although they are not well-made and even have some unreasonable aspects, some villagers are watching intently. Several other mimeographed wall newspapers are lonely and no one glances at them.</p>
<p>A group of people came running noisily from the beach river. The serious running of the willows makes people guess at a glance that something must have happened. Are they pulling a husband? Are they running away in panic? No! They are here to solicit business, crowding and vying to say:</p>
<p>"Comrade, crossing the river?"</p>
<p>"Comrade, I'll carry you."</p>
<p>"Carrying you across the river, okay? Whatever you give is fine."</p>
<p>There are as many as twenty of them. This large group of villagers are arguing endlessly about carrying people across the river. In order to grab business, they often scold each other, some raising their fists, jumping their feet, and making gestures to hit people.</p>
<p>"Go away, we don't need to be carried."</p>
<p>"No, the comrades who just crossed were all carried."</p>
<p>This situation seems to be saying that since they have already carried some people across, then these remaining people cannot refuse.</p>
<p>They call them comrades so familiarly. Who can underestimate these villagers? They also know that the word "Lao Zong" is no longer used to address the soldiers.</p>
<p>The male owner selling buns opens his mouth and laughs heartily.</p>
<p>"You comrades don't know, they have been carrying people these past two days, and they have already done a lot of business carrying you brothers. Don't look down on the villagers, they also know how to speculate."</p>
<p>"Listening to your tone, you don't sound like a Hubei person," Comrade Zhang interjected, with a bun in his mouth.</p>
<p>"Of course, I am not a local," he pondered thoughtfully, then continued, "If it weren't for the war, maybe I wouldn't be in business. Let me tell you, I am from Anhui, and I used to run a primary school."</p>
<p>No wonder, at a glance, he is obviously different from the local villagers. He is not mercenary at all in business. The school environment deeply binds him, causing him to unconsciously bring out some refined air in his words and deeds.</p>
<p>"I have a son who is also in the army..."</p>
<p>"In which unit?" Zhang interrupted and asked warmly.</p>
<p>"Never mind these things, as long as he can win battles."</p>
<p>"Don't you miss him?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of my child, he's really good," he continued as if he hadn't heard the other's question. "He was about to graduate from middle school and was about to find a small job to support himself. But the Japanese devils came. That day, I told him to get ready to leave together. One day, he cried to me and said,</p>
<p>'Dad, I'm leaving.'</p>
<p>I thought he was anxious and wanted to leave sooner, so I comforted him and said:</p>
<p>'What's the rush? We'll go together.'</p>
<p>'Go together?' He shook his head, wiped away his tears. 'Who's going with you? I'm telling you, Dad, I'm going to be a soldier!'</p>
<p>"Then what about you?" Zhang interrupted him and asked abruptly. The others were also listening intently, just like listening to a storyteller.</p>
<p>"Don't interrupt me, let me tell you slowly. When I first heard it, I thought the child was joking, but when I saw the tears on his face, I immediately understood that it was true.</p>
<p>'Good boy, you are a citizen of the Republic of China!'</p>
<p>I patted his shoulders affectionately, and my own eyes were wet, but I finally stopped the outburst of emotion and encouraged him:</p>
<p>'Good boy, you have your future!'</p>
<p>'Dad, I'm leaving.'</p>
<p>'Go,' I waved goodbye. 'If you have time, write a few more letters.'</p>
<p>My child</p>
<h3>Siamese Armaments About to be Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] The Japanese Vice-Consul in Rangoon, Toyojiro Kaneko, left Rangoon on the (Guangzhou Maru) last Sunday to return to his country for a vacation. He arrived in Taikoku (transliteration) in Korea today. He told a reporter from the "Asahi Shimbun" that "The Burmese are very pro-Japanese and buy a lot of Japanese goods. They deeply understand that they can only be saved by shaking hands with the Japanese." He also said, "Rangoon currently has a large number of armaments and ammunition ready to supply the Chiang Kai-shek government. However, there are considerable difficulties in transporting them to the Chinese interior," he said.</p>
