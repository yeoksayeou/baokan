<p>社評</p>
<h3>捷克分裂與歐局</h3>
<p>正在張伯倫表歐局樂觀論調，並且進而準備實現歐洲新的均勢之際，捷克危機近日突轉嚴重，而十三日柏林方面電訊，則已證明「捷克再作重大犧牲」，「捷克接受德國要求，被迫再度分裂」！這一事變有甚麼重大的意義？對於今後歐洲局勢，和對于今後世界情勢，將有甚麼影響？我們對這一事變應該有什麼認識和作怎樣的準備？</p>
<p>自從去年慕尼黑會議之後，捷克斯拉夫卽遭第一次的分裂，德國法西斯首酋在捷克取得了全國範圍的和各部門的控制權，法西斯的毒菌在捷克普遍深入地發展起來。去年捷克之遭受如此慘重的犧牲，第一重要原因是英法兩國統治者對侵略國的妥協政策，尤其是法國達拉第政府追隨張伯倫外交政策之後企圖以弱小盟國的利益，來換取侵略國對於延緩發動歐洲大戰的保證，卒至自動毀棄法捷互助協定，破壞蘇捷互助協定，而使捷克遭受實際上的亡國之痛。第二個重要原因是捷克政府不信賴全國人民一致準備為保衛祖國而戰的力量，在國際壓迫下，尤其是法國毀約壓迫之下，接受屈辱的妥協和平條件，企圖保持捷克在名義上的存在。</p>
<p>然而一切妥協政策和降服路線，不僅不能求得安定與和平，實際上却使侵畧者更猖狂起來，捷克全國在德國法西斯恐怖勢力控制之下，固然實際上嘗受到亡國之痛，卽英法兩國統治者亦未嘗不痛感妥協政策之加重侵略國對英法以至全歐的威脅。因此。慕尼黑會議後半年以來，捷克人民組織統一戰綫反對法西斯爭求自由的運動，固然暗中滋長，英法人民反對妥協政策的統一行動亦在迅速發展，而波蘭則已以捷克對德妥協貽禍，引為前車之鑒，開始轉變其政策，逐斬趨向「世界和平之衛士」的蘇聯。</p>
<p>這種新形勢的發展，自為德國法西斯首酋所憂慮不安者！同時英法兩國統治者尙未放棄對德意兩國妥協政策，西班牙戰事在英法此種政策變本加厲的表現之下開始激變，意大利侵略北菲法屬的行動日益劇烈，歐州整個局勢日趨嚴重，凡此一切新的形勢，均使德國侵略者認為進一步分割捷克建立東侵根據地的適當時機。於是乃有最近策動斯洛伐克人自治運動的陰謀事實。</p>
<p>捷克政府雖然因為全國人民反法西求自由的怒潮澎湃，對德國策動的斯洛伐克「獨立自治」運動加以打擊，然而一方面因為德國法西斯勢力已經控制捷克大局。另一方面德國又作進一步的壓迫，實行兵隊動員和猛烈的反捷運動。同時向捷克提出要求，（一）給斯洛伐克人以自决權，（二）罷免捷克現任國防國長薛羅維將軍及內政部長，（三）保證予波希米亞與摩拉維亞之日耳曼少數民族以護衛。結果據十三日柏林電稱，「此間外交方面消息，證實政府已接納斯洛伐克自治要求及捷國防部長薛羅維之免職。又據捷京消息，捷政府已接納德政府所提建立斯洛伐克獨立國之要求，或並已接納建立一羅遜尼亞獨立國。」斯洛伐克之自捷克分裂，殆已成為必然的事實了。</p>
<p>捷克分裂以後，捷克國土再度縮小三分之一以上，並且包圍在德國中間，再加法西斯在內部的活躍，捷克人民今後反法西斯求自由的鬥爭自將更加困難。同時，德國實際上獲得斯洛伐克以後歐洲局勢又為之一變。我們所應注意的，第一是因為匈牙利加入「反共協定，斯洛伐克再陷法西斯統治之下，甸牙利與波蘭已經接境，波蘭羅馬尼亞將成被刦奪的目標。第二是德意兩國在歐洲的聲愈趨猖獗，而英法在歐洲以至世界的地位則愈趨低落，英法政府雖在幻想新羅迦諾的組織，但終不免為犧牲本身以為德意侵略國服務。第三，歐洲今後局勢旣將愈趨危急，戰爭危機更加嚴重，則日本侵略者在東方的陰謀活動亦必愈加劇烈。這是我們所不能忽視的！最後，我們更應痛切認淸英法妥協外交政策之結果，痛切認淸捷克失敗主義求和政策之禍害，捷克今日的分裂，正是我們的前車之鑒—我們必須加緊淸除公開的與潛伏的失敗主義求和親×的言論行動，加緊全國團結，誓遵國民公約，堅持持久抗戰。</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>論抗戰軍事新決定</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>目前全面戰局，大致尚呈穩定，然整個形勢，已有重大之變化。此種變化之主要事實，卽為×人之內外困難日益嚴重，×人之進攻力量大為削弱，而吾人則已在二十個月之血泊奮鬥中，在戰略上奠定持久抗單之基礎，並已爭得主動之地位；在政治上展開長期團結爭取最後勝利之光明前途。但吾人同時仍須明瞭×人之困難，×軍之退化，尙未達至最高程度；而×人為完成迅速征服中國之針劃，方在加緊其軍略上政略上以至經濟上之種種陰謀；蔣委員長本月十二日通電，所以用　國家民族之命脉尙在存亡呼吸之中，而革命建國事業，成功猶極遼遠」以警勉全國同胞者，盞亦以此。故吾人今日之任務，厥在適應抗戰新形勢，盡力增加×人之困難，阻止×人之進攻，粉碎×人之陰該，同時盡力發揚我民族精神，加緊新生力量之成長，以達到驅逐×人收復失地之目的。</p>
<p>茲據中央社十三日某地電稱，某主任談，最近召集之某種重要會議，業經針對目前階段抗戰形勢，關於今後軍事，已有重要决定。大致分積極的與消極的兩方面。積極方面，除决定全面主動戰之精密戰術外，並决以效死精神帶同部隊，到×人前方後方為民族解放而鬥爭。又為針對×人近來於疲憊無力中用軍事恐嚇方法掩護××政治之推行及拓展陰險經濟計劃之陰謀，而决定在軍事上，奮勇擊潰×之主力，同時實行國民公約，粉粹×人政治詭謀。然後以經濟封鎖之法，不許×商品運入內地，更不許我糧品運入×佔領區內。此種軍事政治經濟一面並進之新决定，若能迅卽付諸實行，進而求　普遍切實，則所子×人陰謀之打擊，自屬異常嚴重。惟吾人所應明瞭者，所謂軍事上擊潰×之主力，不僅尙有賴於我方王力軍戰鬥力之提高，以及華中華南與西北防衛力量之積極增強；同時更有賴於以較大兵力之運動乓團反攻×之翼側與後路，而對於淪陷區游擊戰，尢須以更大努力，統一組織與廣泛發動；此其一。至云政治上實行民公約粉碎×人政冶陰謀，則不僅尙有賴於鋤奸運動之廣泛與切實的展開，對於一切違叛抗戰建國之言論行動，如一切以「反共」「主和」「中日合作」「排斥歐美勢力」為標榜之言論行動，均須予以激底之打擊與掃蕩；同時並須擴大統一的民衆運動，以及實行集中領導下民主政治，首先為各省市縣參議會之迅速成立，充分發揮全國人民參加抗戰建國之自動性與積極性；此其二。而經濟方面之實行對　對鎖，亦須配以農工生活必要程度之改善，淪陷區戰區人民經濟抗×運動之推進，及廣大後方工農生產與合作事業加速發展，方克奏其全功；此其三。凡此三者，均為今日當局所須注視，亦為全國同胞尤其海外僑胞所應竭其忠盧盡其物力以促其成功者也。</p>
<p>消極方面，是次會議亦有頗關重要之决定，而尤注意於政治文化各種力量之鞏固，以期配合兩面的革命戰術；政治上决定加强各級政治機構及鞏固革命政治機構，並增强民衆抗戰力量；文化上决定加增抗戰文化工作，發揚民族精神，以便提高革命情緒；人事上决定遵照人事法規，選賢任能；經理上决定遵照經理法規，廉潔奉公；最後並制定帶兵練兵及用乓之簡捷有效步驟。此種决定，包含甚為廣泛，想必另有精密具體之辦法；然已提綱絜領，而予吾人觀察今後軍政以明朗樂觀之根據；關心抗戰建國與民族革命前途者，當無不為之欣慰有加，而期其迅速實現者矣。惟凡此諸端，究為爭取抗戰勝利之一般的基本的要求，如云政治上之加强及鞏固政治機構，以及增強民衆抗戰力量；則如何調節各政黨各民族各階層間之關係，俾在全民族大團結之組織形式下順利進行？仍為當前最緊急之問題。如云文化上之加強抗戰文化工作，發揚民族精神提高革命情緒，則如何清掃抗戰文化工作之障礙，如國內一切潛伏的妥協主和份子與失敗主義者，將如何肅淸？國外一切為日×服務而以打擊抗戰建國運動為目的之漢奸言論行動，將如何掃蕩，皆為當前最嚴重之問題。如云人事上之實行選賢任能，則首須考慮如可破除黨派成見，與粉碎任用親好之封建傳統等等問題。如云經理上之提倡廉潔奉公，則首須考慮如何肅淸封建殘餘努力？如何創造適應革命抗戰之風氣？等等問題。此在政府當局，必能高瞻遠矚，毅然決然，予以澈底之解抉；而在我全民族忠誠愛國與勇于自愛之同胞，亦當悉索精力，協助政府，使其完善解决者也。</p>
<p>此外不論當前抗戰軍事新計劃則已，不然，則培養大批抗戰建國幹工作之幹部人才，實為吾人今日最緊迫之任務。畫×人之戰鬥力，旣未受大量消耗，×人之攻略，旣未遭致命打擊，×人之陰謀又方利用國際上每一時機及我方殘存弱點而在繼續活動，誠如蔣委員長所昭示，『吾國家民族之命脉尙在存亡呼吸之中，而革命建國事業成功　極遼遠，』則吾人今日不能不加緊培養人批幹部，發展新生力量，以便堅持持久抗戰，藉以爭取最後勝利。是次會議之制定帶兵練兵及用兵之簡捷，有效步驟，自為當局注意及此之明證。又據十四日晚報載稱，西南行營政治部主任梁寒操談，『刷新國軍政治工作幹部，共需訓練六萬名。現經訓練六月，畢業者有五千餘人，正在受訓者萬餘人，一面繼續招考，廣事徵集，務達每連設一指導員之目的，並附以工作隊，提高士兵戰鬥精神。將來新兵訓練，尢注重政治訓練。』當局此種決定，深符各方歷次籲請及二十個月實際抗戰經騐之需求，吾人於欣慰之餘，願供一得之愚者：厥為改善軍隊政治工作幹部訓練首須注視訓練者之愼　選在，務以確具豐富之經騐學識與其在民衆中在部隊中之堅強威信者為標準，同時必須輕視其社會階層與黨派系統之從屬關係；次之關於受訓幹部之徵集，亦當捐棄關於社會階層民族黨派從屬之岐視，主重其民族意識及革命情緒之程度，而對於海外僑胞之踴躍投効者，尤當特予鼓勵。誠能如是，則以之應付目前抗戰軍事需要，或能靈活自是而收預期之效果矣。</p>
<h3>粵省軍政當局　朂淪陷區民衆團隊</h3>
<p>發揮廣東精神保持固有光榮　嚴守革命紀律展開游擊戰爭</p>
<p>【某地快訊】第四戰區代司令長官張發奎，副司令長官余　謀，及粵省府主席李漢魂發表告淪陷區自衛游擊隊書，茲錄前文如下：同跑們！同志們：</p>
<p>自從日×在大亞灣登陸，大舉侵患我廣東，到現在已將半年了。在這牛年中間，×人在佔領區域裏面，到處橫行無忌，××婦女，殺害壯丁難民，踐踏我田園廬舍恣意欺壓奴役我人民，使我同胞流離顯沛，妻離子散，家破人亡，×人手段的毒狠，良心的險惡，眞是世界空前所木有。在這牛年中間，全華南人民，沒有一個不關懷淪陷區域的同胞的境遇，沒有一個不痛心切齒，誓為受盡磨難的同胞們復此深仇發奎等受黨國託付，負着華南軍政的　責，沒有一時一刻能忘記同胞們所受的痛苦，更沒有一時一刻不在策勵軍民同日×戰鬥，以消除同胞們的灾難，把同胞們從水深火熱中解救出來。</p>
<p>自×入南侵以來，廣東各地自銜團和游擊隊，都能深明大義，一致奮起參加抗戰，你們在各戰襲擊×人，擾亂×人的種種英勇事實，發奎等　華南軍民以及全國同胞，都知道得很淸楚，凡遇這種消息傅來的時候，廣東人的光榮，同時也是中華民族的光榮。</p>
<p>我們廣東民衆，一向都是抵抗外侮的先鋒，在過去，廣東太平漁民三元里居民，寶安民衆，都曾起來抵抗過那些侵入我國的外國軍隊，把他們打得望風披靡，逼使他們退出我們的領土，在對外的抗戰史上，建立了不朽的功績。最近在抗日戰爭中，中山縣壯丁吳發，曾政次渡　襲擊三灶島的×寇，潮汕自衛團人隊長洪之政，率隊克　南澳，先後把××殺得聞風喪胆，連日本以前駐南京領事須磨都說：『廣東精神』，就是革命精神由此可見×寇是怎樣的懼怕廣東的民氣。</p>
<p>同胞們！同志們！你們要發揮廣東人對外抗戰的這種英勇精神，奮發　東民氣，把你們自衛團游擊隊練成鐵的抗日隊伍！</p>
<p>怎樣才能把地万團隊，變為鐵的抗日隊伍呢？</p>
<p>第一，要服從命令，嚴守紀律愛護民衆，不服從命令，嚴守律，就無法打仗；不愛護民衆，也就决不能打勝仗。大家不要忘了，大家本身就是來目民衆，打完了反回去，還是民衆，地方武裝部隊原本就是民衆的武力，所以必須要愛護民衆，帮助民衆，更要時時刻刻顧到民衆的利益，在地方上要切實做到不擾民不害民的地步，買物照給價錢，借了東西必還，駐宿的地方，要打掃淸潔，說話要和藹，——樣的隊伍，才能打勝仗。</p>
<p>第二，要遍地發展正確的游擊戰爭，處處襲擊×人牽制×人，找到×人的小股，殲滅他們，遇到×人的步哨或前站，成無恥的漢好，把他消滅掉，發現×人的弱點，給以迅雷不及掩耳的打擊，使他們赶不及增援，抓住×軍行動的時候，予以截擊，特別注意他不戒備的時候，宿營或休息的時候，給他有力的打擊，如遭遇到大股×軍，不能取勝時，迅速有計劃的散開，以備後即約定地點再行集合。當×軍隊隊來攻無法再守時，事前要把附近橋樑道路都破壞把食糧及日用必需品都藏起來，男女都逃走，以免皮×人屠殺，使他們來時撲一個空，當他駐下時，刻刻擾亂他，當他退走時，沿途埋伏襲擊他，調杳出×人的交通線，隨時地破壞他，處處注意×人的運輸，遇有機會，便把他們輜重截下來，斷絕他們部隊的給養。祇　這樣不斷的襲擊×人，用種種方法反抗×人，才能使你們的部隊健全起來。</p>
<p>同胞們！同志們！你們必須要認淸×人的眞面目，永不要忘了，日×是我全民族的生死對頭。他有時放棄燒殺政策　爲的是呌我們俯首貼耳做他的奴隸牛馬，任憑他驅使宰割。你們要號召當地全體同胞　共同約定，永不上×人利誘威脅的當！</p>
<p>你們要家家戶戶互相勗勉，永不做順民，不做漢好，不用日僞鈔票，永世不做亡國奴。</p>
<p>同胞們！同志們！你們要堅决的奮鬥到底，全國的同胞，都在期待你們，要你們臥薪嘗胆，繼續抗戰到底，政府和全國　胞，决不辜負你們，我們關念你們艱辛奮鬥，我們史懷念你們的前途！</p>
<p>同胞們！同志們！發揮廣東固有的光榮，　定起你們的戰鬥决心，繼續不斷來　擊的起×人。配合國軍抗戰到底，驅逐日×出　領土，爭取最後勝利。使我們中華民挨子孫，萬世千秋，永久的平等自由生存於世界　　（救亡社）</p>

<h3>空室清野（上）　北線游擊戰爭中　寶貴經騐與敎訓</h3>
<p>— 本報駐西安記者白雲</p>
<p>一、意義</p>
<p>空室淸野（堅壁淸野的通俗語說法，已通用於華北各游擊區。）在我們的民族革命戰爭中，特別在游擊戰爭中，是爭取勝利和困疲×人的一個巧妙的方法。</p>
<p>這一方法，在華北各游擊區中，特別在山西，已普遍的予以運用，而目收效甚宏。在其蓮用的過程中，自然　許多的經騐和敎訓，可以作為全國各戰區發展游擊戰的參攷。</p>
<p>空室淸野，對×人有甚　損害？對我們有甚麼利益？</p>
<p>第一，空室淸野，可以使×人　攻我們時失去一切軍事上的便利，如利用我們的民衆，担任嚮導，偵探等工作和其一切軍事服役，可以使×人得不到佔領區域中人力和物力的便利，如捕壯丁，就地徵發糧食，燃料，畜牲等等。這樣可以造成我們殲滅×人的有利條件，×人不是在中途會被我們消滅，便是在佔領我們一　之後而無法立足，以至不能不退。</p>
<p>第二，空室淸野，屢次實行之後，×人有了痛苦的經驗，在下次進攻我們時，便不能不自行携帶大批的輜重隊，和駝騾隊，隨軍進行，供給糧糈，這樣將更陷×人行軍於累贅不便；換言之，更可以造成我們襲擊×人，奪獲×人大批輜重的有朴條件。</p>
<p>第三，空室淸野，不但是可以避免×人對我物力和人力的利用，還可以避免×人的燒殺×掠，致陷我民衆於　大損失，這樣便可以保存我們的人力和物力，因而保持我們持久抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>第四，空室淸野，不是消極的避難主義，而是積極的組繳民衆，形成眞正的軍民合作，增加抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>二、方法</p>
<p>空室淸野的消極方法：首先估計×人來攻的可能路線，於×人已到相當距離之前，發動這个路線附近的羣衆，先對容易資×和容易被×破壞的笨重東西，如糧食與商店中貨物之類，搬運於事先勘定的隱蔽處所。其次對於　弱射孺，家畜，衣飾，鍋具，風箱，碗碟，柴火等等，也要依次藏避得幹乾淨凈。當民衆出發時或搬運東西時，如遇有疾病老弱不堪步行者，或有笨重東西不易移動者，應選拔壯丁組織担架隊或運輸隊，協助進行。如有不能及時搬完的糧食等等，也要予以燬滅，以免資×。對於商人，也要　外選擇安全地方，作臨時營業</p>
<p>積極方法：消極的方法只是避免損失，積極方法是還要予×人以種種打擊，除守護上述隱蔽地以外的壯丁，必須組織起來，與部隊聯合作戰，卽使偶爾有被×八執獲的民衆，也要裝聾作啞的將東指西，以虛爲實，不爲×人服役，進而陷×人於不利。第二，將所有的水并，予以塞蔽，向池塘或附近河流的上游，酒入顏料，使×人發生懷疑，而不敢飲用。第三，在村莊路口厠所菜園等預料×人必去必經的地方，埋置地雷，炸藥，在門後或樹上吊炸彈。第四，鎖閉屋鬥，使×懷疑門內設伏或埋置炸藥，而不敢入內。</p>
<p>三、實行之準備工作</p>
<p>空室淸野是一個艱難的工作，若做得不好，不但不能給予×人打擊，還會招致本身意外的損失。</p>
<p>部隊中的政治工作人員，和做民衆運動的人員，平時對民衆必須儘量宣傅並解釋空室淸野的意義，使民衆瞭解。必要時，並作實際演習，養成迅速而整齊的習慣。</p>
<p>政府，部隊和民衆，平時必須打成一片，完全合作，政府與部隊對民衆，必須以全力協助實行空室淸野的工作。如對於民衆隱蔽　要使之有組織，作有秩序的動作，對隱蔽地點和埋蔽糧食的地點，事先要　可能的作安全的規劃，保障民衆的利益，對於隱蔽地點食宿之分配與應為隊部存留的餘糧和用品之多寡等，事先應有充分的設計，勿使軍民因空室淸野而感到食用缺乏，對×人來攻的路綫和時間，應根據正確的情報，儘可能的作正確的估　，勿使空室淸野工作之實施，有過遲或過早之慮，因而影響到民衆之安全與軍事行動，如到有退却之必要時，必須傅知民眾，使有所準備，隱蔽地點如被×人發現時，必須儘可能的負保護之責，民衆退却時，也要掩趣退却，這樣才能取得民衆的信仰，才能做到軍政民的眞正合作，才能獲得空室淸野的效果。</p>
<p>歸納起來說，政府與部隊，對空室淸野工作：第一要有計劃，不能臨事慌張；第二，要有步驟，不能閒風逃跑；第三，要有領導，不能使民衆認空室淸野　單純的逃難主義，失去積極的政治意義。</p>
<p>四、所收的效果</p>
<p>去年十月間，×人進攻晉冀察邊境，去年十二月間，×人進攻晉西，今年一月間，×人進攻晉東南，以及其他過去在華北大大小小的諸戰役中，空室消野，常常是我們取得勝利的重要條件之一。在那些地方，對空室清野的工作，素有準備，所以當×人進攻的砲聲響了以後，各個接近×區的村莊，都能普遍的有秩序的實施空室清野，使×人行軍不能不審愼，因而極為遲緩，到達一地或佔領一地之後，不用說吃的沒有，就連柴炭也找不到，結果只有退却。吉縣和遼縣和順諸縣的×人之退却，固然主要的是由於我們堅决的戰鬥决定的，然而空室淸野的作用也很大。五台的×人，雖然佔領了縣城，然而這只是一個一無所用的空城，連一枝火柴都是後來×人由別處運去的。</p>
<p>去年十月初，佔領冀西北阜平縣的×人，因為找不到一個老百姓，弄不到一顆糧食，只好用大批汽車，由定縣運輸給養，這使我得到沿途襲擊×人輜　的機會，在黨城王快鎭一帶我們攔路參獲×人大批給養，弄得阜平的×人，無法久駐，因此一部份一部份的撤退，終被我們收復了縣城。</p>
<p>去年十月初，進攻晉東北柏蘭鐵等路的×人，都有三百多匹駝騾的給養隊，隨軍前進　結果都被我們奪走了，軍事上迅速的取得勝利，這都是空室淸野的效果。　（未完）</p>

<p>某次有在中國前綫士兵致函其親屬朋友、論及戰地情形及食物缺乏之苦、被當局檢扣、造成所謂前纏函怪事、邇後此種函件、均不能達於收信人矣</p>

<h3>祝中央研究院評議會</h3>
<p>在央研究院為全國　高學衛研究機關，過去在蔡元培先生及任鴻雋翁文灝諸氏領導之下，對於中國學術界，曾有偉大建樹。現在抗戰建國，轉入一新階段，諸凡有關文化工作及學術思想諸端，均應集中力量，為抗戰建國事業而服務。而電訊傳來，中研院第三次評議會業於十三日開幕，吾人對此，謹表欣慰；並以誠　，希望此次會議，根據五中全會及參政會決議案，暨領袖最近宣主文吿之基本精神，確立　戰建國之文化工作及學術研究之鋼領，同時配合全國國民稍神總動員綱領，對於如何發揚民族自尊心自信心，如何提高全國人民學術研究情緒，如何發展民族革命文化運動，如何使文化　術為澈底實現革命的三民主義而奮鬥，成立具體的方案與辦法，並　所以切　施行，以求實効。參加評議會諸先生，不僅為全國學術界前進，多數又為政府負責領袖，深望在嚴叱緊張之會議中，對於　務抗戰建國與實現民族解放，能有　偉大之貢献。</p>
<h3>蘇日關係緊張</h3>

<p>然則蘇日兩國之戰事，固將自今日以後趨於爆發　段乎？是則猶有待於　重之觀察。首應注意者，厥為日本之實力，在中國已日益困窘，更何能對蘇作戰？此親於十三晚日本議會　論海陸軍追加預算時質問戰，卽可明瞭。蓋大和會議員滿村質問日本如何又與他國發生戰事時，陸相坂垣徒以政府「决求根本解决」相答，無法說出如何解决辦法也。</p>
<p>惟吾人更應明瞭，日×今日虛聲强硬對蘇，首在企圖刺激國內人心，緩和反戰情緒，次在響應德意在歐洲之活動，而謀於遠東伺機劫奪；同時尤可注意者，則爲藉對蘇作虞準備，而散佈中止侵華謠言，俾便親日主和份子之活動，以鬆懈我抗戰力量，以便利其新的進攻，吾人深信蘇聯終將予×以更大打擊，吾人更須警防『和平』奸謀，堅持　戰到底。</p>

<p>振作是生路，頹廢是死路　國民精神總動員　奇卓　各校紛紛訂定具體公約實踐</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>振作是生路，頺廢是死路　國民精神總動員　各校紛紛訂定具體公約實踐</h3>
<p>自從戰幕揭開，烽火四起之後，固然苦幹，嚴肅，進步的現象使我們無限感慰；但是，時至今日，尙有萎靡，荒淫，貪汚的黑影存在，眞使我們無限痛心！</p>
<p>針對着國家民族在現階段的需要，蔣委員長新近制定『國民精神總動昌綱領』，提交五中全會及第三屆國民參政會通過，日前經已通電全國施行，全文亦經各報發表，這是幾天來最惹人注意，最使人興奮的一榕大事。</p>
<p>僑居本港有識之士，對此益　興奮，因為吾們身居海外，較之國內同胞生活已極形優越，比較南洋各屬僑胞，又更為浪費與萎靡，這不特無以對國家，抑亦影嚮國際的視聽。因此，本港各校，經决定嚮應國民精神總動員運動，以企振刷本港僑胞的精神，使人人有以覺悟，風氣有以轉變。記者於感奮之中，咋天特地前往各校訪問詳細情形，以謀有以嚮諸讀者。</p>
<p>擁有將及一千個學生而富有朝氣的知用中學的辦法是這樣的：</p>
<p>一、由該校各導師組織精神動員委員會，實施精神總動員工作：</p>
<p>二、第一次宣誓，定期本月二十日紀念週全體員生總宣誓一次；</p>
<p>三、採取聯保辦法每導師之下，每十人為一組，組內互相監督，各組亦互相監督，同組者以居處相近為原則；</p>
<p>四、每週由導師召集所領導之學生全體或分別精神講話；</p>
<p>五、每個員生，須先向家庭宣傳繼向戚友宣傅精神總動員之需嬰及國民公約之遵守，更集合全體員生，發行刊物，作社會上一般之宣傳；</p>
<p>六、如有違背誓言，同組同學，如不檢舉，受連坐罪，同組中有遠誓言者，其他同組亦予相當懲處，如能履行誓言，成績優異者，予以獎勵；</p>
<p>七、精神動員會每星期開會一次，檢討一週工作，議决懲獎問題，推動全會工作。</p>
<p>得到知用中學剛從會議產生出來的新鮮辦法之後，立刻跑到中華業餘學校去。從他們過去的辦學作風中，可預知對于此事，是不落人後的。果然，下面就是業餘學校實行精神動校的好辦法：</p>
<p>「時期」於民國二十八年三月二十日（星期一）下午八時十分，在該校禮堂，舉行宣誓典禮，開始實行。</p>
<p>「共同目標」（一）國家至上，民民族至上！（二）軍事第一，勝利第一！（三）意志集中，力紫集中！</p>
<p>『實施辦法』（一）早起：六時起牀！（二）守時：上課，集會，早到一分跑！（三）健身：親操勞動工作，整潔室內室外，健身運動，星期旅行！（一四）負責：遇事勇敢向前，堅持到底，决不中途退却！（五）學習：每日必閱報紙，新畫，雜誌，追求研究學習大時代必需的　知識新技能，而努力為大時代服務！（六）節約：不吸煙，不飲酒，不賭博，不擦口紅，不穿高跟皮鞋，不載金銀首師，××××××，把節省下來的錢献給國家！</p>
<p>「精神講話」每連星期一、舉行精神講話，以振奮全體精神。</p>
<p>記者在有收所穫的與奮心情之下，再驅車趕到擁有一千三百個舉生，辦理亦稱完善的華南中學去。</p>
<p>關於響應國民精神總動員，該校先决定四個這樣的厚則：</p>
<p>一、將原有的「特種課程」課以精神動員的材料，以期深入；</p>
<p>二、師生舉行個別談話，以企針對各生個性，使其澈底覺悟，蓬蓬勃勃向上；</p>
<p>三、學生會及級會之壁紙，出版精神動員特輯，以期互相研討，共同遵守；</p>
<p>四、以「國民精神總動員」為目前全校訓育的中心工作。</p>
<p>至於具體辦法，該校定於今天下午開會决守。</p>
<p>繼續訪問廣大附中，華僑中學，眞光女中等校的時候，他們都已放學了。在張灡洲，李達人，謝飛烈諸先生領導之學校亦决一致嚮應。港元敎聯會，亦經於咋晚開會，一致通過分函全港中小學校，遵照蔣委員長諭命之『國民精神總動員綱領』切實推行。</p>
<p>又聞華商總會亦將實行精神動員，這尤其使我們更加興奮，因為該會所擁有的商家，僑胞，是一個很大的數目，要是幹得好，影響是非常宏大的，但是，因爲鑒於過去捐欵的冷淡。以及最近的年宵節約運動的成績，我們誠懇希望華商網會諸先進以及各商家僑胞，愼重此舉，努力推行！</p>

<h3>幾個著名女星的　不見經傳的丈夫</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>最近有一位有名的銀行家到好萊塢、他對於影界的情形是不甚熱悉的、託另一位朋友介紹、想見見着名的影星們、</p>
<p>『那未、你想見見克勞黛潑萊斯曼、琴洛絲、弗琴妮廬平、愛琳格烈芬、嗎特蓮愛斯脫雷、瑪莎露絲、和瑪格烈海華嗎』、這位朋友問他、</p>
<p>『我從來不曾聽見過她們』、他說、『誰要見那些臨時演員們呢、我要見幾个眞正的大明星』、</p>
<p>那位朋所說的幾位眞是無名小卒麼？這位銀行家回答的話就此放走一個可以見克勞黛考爾白、琴亞瑟、佛琴妮勃魯絲、愛琳鄧、瑪特蓮嘉珞兒、瑪莎蕾、和瑪格烈莎　文的大好機會、那位朋友所說的名字都替她們冠上一個夫姓、而這些丈夫們在好萊塢幾乎沒有什麼人知道的、</p>
<p>可是他們有的在自己的職業界十赫赫有各、有的是百萬富翁、儘有的比妻子賺更多的薪金、然而因為他們不常在照片上露面、而且永沒有人去訪問他們、所以能够知道他們究竟的人們、十不得一、</p>
<p>這些丈夫們差個多有一个共同的特點、痛惡宣傳、像克勞黛克爾白的丈夫佐潑萊斯曼醫生罷、當克勞黛和她前夫瑙門福斯脫結婚時、婚事是常被人談起、　篇講到克勞黛的東西、總要提到瑙門福斯脫的名字、因為他是个電影演昌而宣傳工作是大有利於他的事業、但這次就不同了、跟潑萊斯曼結婚、克勞黛完全改變了作風、有人訪問時、她絕口不談她的私生活以及提起她丈夫的名字、這都是照着他丈夫的意思做的、因為潑萊斯曼醫士認為靠一個女明星的丈夫的銜頭來出風頭實在是一件大可恥的事情、新婚時他甚至拒絕和克勞黛同攝照片登出、後來經她解釋、每一個女星的丈夫都這樣做、拒絕了反會引起攝影記者們的惡感後、他才不再堅持已意、和她接近的朋友們說、好萊塢人都以為克勞黛的工作要比她丈夫來得繁重、克勞黛認為這是錯誤的、據她的意思、他的工作重得多、祗要我們知道她丈夫作些什麼事、想來也可以承認她的話、</p>
<p>潑萊斯曼醫士是哈佛醫校畢業生、曾在紐約着名倍拉醫院裏當過駐院醫師、而現在洛杉磯兩個重要醫院內服務、經驗充足、空下來的時候、常常作醫學上的研究工作、而這些工作或竟能一新醫學歷史的面目、然而世人對干他所知道的、祇是『他是克勞黛考爾白的丈夫一、這是多麼可氣的事、</p>
<p>他是個漂亮的男子、現在是三十六歲、堂堂六尺的身材、無論在那一方面都很足令異性注意、克勞黛初次看見他是在他的醫務所內、她是看病的、對於這樣一位大明星的光臨、他似乎毫不理會、也許就是這一點、格外激起了克勞黛的興趣、然而她那時也毫無和她的醫生墜入情綱的感覺、直到某次偶而在高爾夫場上遇見了他、很談了一陣話、克勞黛才知道在醫務所之外的他是怎樣一個有趣的人物、一九三五年十二月裏、在猶馬結了婚、</p>
<p>李倫海華也和潑萊斯曼抱有同感、雖則他自己是國內有數的名律師、可是在人前、也不過就是『瑪格烈莎麗文先生』而已、更壞的是、常常有人把他的名字和魯意斯海華弄錯、魯意斯海華也是女明星意達盧壁諾的丈夫、</p>
<p>影圈中人提到他的名字時、總伴以一種尊敬或妒忌的意味、不錯、他常常使那些製片家感到頭痛、但他同時也是好多影　——曼琳霍金絲、弗蕾亞斯坦、琴逑羅吉樂——和編劇人的法律代表人、</p>
<p>因為他的手段高妙有趣、有不少逸話都是以他作中心人物構成的、其中最有趣的一則是說他賣劇本的事、他用了高壓手段說得天花亂墜的强迫一位製片家出五萬美金貨一個劇本、交易談成了、他撥了一個電話給那寫作人、『喂、聽着、我已經替你賣掉一個劇本了、你頂好快點寫超來罷、』五萬元買一個尙未動筆的劇本、怎能叫他們不頭痛呢、一</p>
<p>李倫來目一個高貴的家庭、父親是比爾海華上校、他卒人也受過高等敎育、在普林斯頓得過學位、他常陪伴女子們同行、所以在未和瑪格烈莎麗文結婚之前、一時頗有他將和凱塞赫本結合的信念、</p>
<p>開始是如此、瑪格烈莎麗文以某一事件當事人的資垎上他辦公室去、一見鐘情的、他瘋狂能愛上了她、現在他倆是好萊塢最快活的伴侶中之一對了、朋友都說們、只他才能馴伏瑪格烈莎麗文的野性呢。</p>
<p>琴壓瑟對外很少談到她那不為人所知的丈夫、佛蘭克洛絲、可是最近來佛蘭克却時常談到她、</p>
<p>佛蘭克是哈爾羅攝影場製片部的助埋員、一個暗色皮膚的瘦長子、樣子非常好看、有好多次上銀幕的機會、他都拒絕不受、他覺得不如把演戲方面的事留結琴亞瑟的好、</p>
<p>當他第一次遇見琴亞瑟時、他正經營着地產事業、到加州來作一次旅行、他也會是普林斯登的學生、而日常所接觸的朋友們全是高尙家庭裏出來的富有保守性的人、一到好萊塢、樣樣都新奋、使他高興起來、他遇見琴時、覺得她正是他心目中的人兒、別人說她驕傲、而他以為、那不過是她那點害羞心理的表現罷了、琴有點『下等錯綜』的心理、在做了朋友之後就經佛蘭克努力帮助她改掉、（未完）</p>

<h3>新淡水巡禮</h3>
<p>— 復然</p>
<p>從淡水收復後到臨時行政委員會</p>
<p>（一）敵人滾蛋了</p>
<p>十一月七日那天、靑天白日滿地紅的旗幟、在淡水的每一個威頭招展着、好象在呼喊、『囘來吧、淡水的同胞　、×八滾蛋了　。』</p>
<p>×人為什末要滾蛋、惠寶人民抗日　擊隊在他們警戒　裏面的活躍、無情地給禍國殃民奸的懲辦、各地的靑年及工農羣衆武裝團結的力量一天天的澎大——最大的威脅、×人深感到自己兵力的薄弱、怕死、怕　全部消滅、不得不拖着可憐的尾巴滾蛋了、</p>
<p>（二）召開民衆大會</p>
<p>被摧殘到氣息奄奄體無完膚的淡水、為了社會秩序和善後問題、就在十一月十二日那天召開一个民衆大會。這一天到會的除救亡工作靑年及一小部份商民外、其餘全數是各鄉的農民、人數約四五百人、在這富有非常　義的　會中、提出了今後的新工作、</p>
<p>一、建立臨時行政委員會為當地高政治璣構、</p>
<p>二、廣泛地開展民衆救亡運動、</p>
<p>三、廢除苛什、改善人民生　、</p>
<p>四、動員民衆加緊肅奸運動。</p>
<p>（三）建立臨時行政委員會與新人物登塲</p>
<p>這個新機構原動力是什末東西呢、是九個年靑的伙子、九個淡水救運的領袖、一向他們便以不折不撓的突擊精神奮鬥着的、在淡水的淪陷期間、他們港伏在附近的山鄉區和妥協投降苟且偷安的心理、和恐日病作殊死戰、為若煽動抗戰的烽火、組織游擊　而每天最少要跑五十里路的像伙、</p>
<p>現在、他們在這混亂狀態下面、怎樣有嚴　而活潑的佈置、為執行民衆太會的各項決議而奮鬥呢、</p>
<p>一、建立軍　部——員責發動當地民衆加緊武裝組繳、參加游擊隊的偉大的行列中去、</p>
<p>二、建立肅奸部——動員各鄉鎭加緊肅　武裝的祖　、設立各鄉的情報網、</p>
<p>三、敎育　——　辦難童學校及普遍地發動各鄉鎮舉辦夜學、</p>
<p>四、行政部——廢除一切苛什、實行改善人民生活、禁止糧食出口及耕牛出口或屠殺、禁娼禁賭、</p>
<p>行政委員會的存在、只是短短的二十天區署要恢復了、但雖只二十天、　會柣序却逐漸恢復起來、一般流離失所的淡水同胞們、也漸漸地囘到　鄉來了、</p>
<p>從臨時行政委員會到區署的恢復</p>
<p>（一）區署恢復及其施政新計劃</p>
<p>惠陽縣政府、以臨時行政委員會在這艱苦混亂中能出來肩負艱巨的靑年伙子、表示嘉　、為尊巾民衆　公意起見、再把區政又由他們九個委員去主持、從九個人中圈定一人　區長、</p>
<p>他們爲着新談水、為着全區的前途决定了施政計劃、動員全區民衆爲現它而實奮鬥。</p>
<p>在財政經濟計劃用——他們要沒收漢奸財產、取消苛捐什稅、節省開支、禁止浪費、嚴懲貪汚鄉長及土豪劣紳、公務員不　薪餉、規定最低的生活費、保　及協助一切工商業之營業及發展、取締奸商之任何壟斷操縱：協助生產消費合作社及限制高利貸、辦理低利及無利借貸、</p>
<p>在改善人民生活計刻里——　土地法及酌量地方情形減租、依佃農保護法保障農民佃耕土地之永佃權、辦理水利及救災……</p>
<p>在救濟難民計劃里——向僑胞及殷商作信用借貸　借　難民、在山卿區劃出可開墾地方分配給　海　民、</p>
<p>在內務計劃里——　施處置漢奸及獎漢奸自首之辦法、保障及協助一切愛國團體及愛國運動、普遍組織民衆武裝、優待抗戰軍人家屬、發揮保甲制度的積極作…用一…</p>
<p>在敎育計劃里——　　免費的小學敎育、建立各種文化團　、研究會、　畫買、公共圖書館、圖書流通供應社……</p>
<p>並已、他們指出要實現這些計劃、一定要做到：區政不匪救亡工作脫節、集中一切救亡工作者為實現這計劃而　力、區署職員提高積極性、　模範作用、建立嚴密的巡視與檢查制度。</p>
<p>我們深切相信這些人是一定會得到民衆的擁護的、因為他們的計劃完全是從人民利益出發的、并目要們也確信他們一定會勝利的、因為他們的計劃會得到人民的擁護、</p>
<p>實在他們已在勝利中了、他們經常得到民衆們的物質帮助、蕃署、靑菜、還有過新年時的年羔、花生、和甘蔗……新墟鄉一个救亡工作者寫的、『昨晚居然有很多很多的民衆都在嘆息你（區長）到了新墟二三個鐘頭就　了、我也曾替你向他們道歉、但是他們的心到底還是　掛着你、好像、你是他們人眾的愛人』</p>

<p>南華　戰東方而適逢大雨之後、實是南華南大盤令技術之好機會、而是東方之致命傷、事成過去、他可勿論、現在要談人所未談　兩點、第一、東方與南華俱是國軍、何以東方慘敗後竟有人在近海一邊的棚座上大放鞭、那放鞭爆的人要說不是中國人、則西人斷無喜見南華勝之理、要是中國人、何以對國隊表示幸灾樂禍的舉動、放鞭爆的人、裏邊不知生着　何樣心腸、其次劉慶才何故忽在重要賽會中突然缺塲、這也長耐人尋味的一囘事、</p>
<p>『辣椒仔』郭　祺改變作風充為前衛來、居然距頭是道，據他那日之當出、眞有點連劉廉才　自愧勿如、勇邁絕倫的許竟成有時奈何他不得、候澄陷也被他和麥紹漢合力監視得一籌莫展、一時觀者稱怪、其寔這并非絕奇之事、因為小郭在小型球界裏也是常常前傾者、駕　就孰、自然熟極生巧。可惜他身才太矮　不然或可成　小全十美的前衛健將、</p>
<p>東方如不調還許竟成整理前衛綫、我不敢恭維他們後此必再有進步、前鋒綫如能得回一個鄒文治的　內鋒、陳炳土也多練切入　門法、則東方不可以小覬、我現在又為他們着想、覺得羅偉權是右方人物而且是內衛才、　他的兄長　偉民沒有兩樣、曾仲雲雖好、還是當即衛好、如果得不囘一個鄒文治的人物的話、我以為他們能照下表改變陣容、包管他們下季有大收獲、</p>
<p>劉顯漢</p>
<p>苗華國　羅偉權</p>
<p>許竟成　宋靈聖　曾仲雲</p>
<p>澄滔　吳祺祥　李德祺　劉始襸　陳炳土</p>
<p>今日東方戰光華、須要仔細、光華戰南華時也曾有極好的演出、東方戰南華南旣曾演出當仁不讓的精神、光華　自有　力爭上游不顧一切的心理、光華內衛右强左弱、惟是前衛又右弱左强、適相彌補、并非弱　、前鋒綫為力似史較東方來得勻循、高速率的攻勢更可怕、以沒有許竟成的東方前衛　能否抵得光華往無前的前鋒來、還是疑問、我很望東方　力、能冉勝一陣、圖取亞軍銜、</p>
<p>東方在本星期六戰海軍於其人　零落時、是他們取勝之莫大機會、望他們加倍努力、如果能先勝一兩球、勝利便穩、但、劉顯漢要謹防海軍自遠亂　倖中的　法、切不可大意、海軍近射欠準、　今之東方前衛力雖難保不被身重好衝之海東攻近發射、我反因此點為東方担心、</p>
<p>南華南本星期六初到界限街塲比賽、須要仔細、到時更望警察華員應以同樓為念、只可極力作技術之表演、不可憑血氣之勇、因為兄弟今雖鬩牆、南華南後此還要禦共的、力向　　爭上游</p>
<p>傑志會者番戰三十營炮兵、應要異常盡力、得　後、便是與飛機隊爭亞軍之權、努力吧、前途似錦、</p>
<p>英國隊缺少足球健將、竟錄用到四個乙組人物、大中華隊宜必得大勝、何況尙有李惠堂因係慈善賽而允出揚、勝利更覺把握得上足搽當、在東方戰南華　後放鞭爆者。何不　那日的鞭炮留囘星期日放、較為有意思、</p>

<h3>烟懺</h3>
<p>— 履平</p>
<p>從三砲台的綠色絨包裏我抽出最後的一枝紙煆，默然，點然亞我和它接着水別的一吻，享樂生活的憧憬，逐漸消失于絮般霧般的輕烟中，十多年的伴侶，就這麼無言分手。</p>
<p>煆，確會倍伴了我十多年。據一般的解說，烟對于人的好處是可以增長思素，可以恢復疲勞，而它的壞處，却是刺激神經，傷害胃臟。我愛燜，却不是因它於我有益處，我宣佈和它永別，也不是怕它含有毒害身體的尼古丁。</p>
<p>在朋儕的交際中，我認識了烟，在生活的享受中，我　上了烟。</p>
<p>回憶半生浮浪，在亨樂的生活裏，烟確曾是我一刻不離的膩友，當燈紅酒綠，它疲軟地掛在我沉醉的唇邊；在狂歡浪謔的場合，他帮助我雄辯的姿態；無聊時望着輕煙的變幻，可以消磨半天光景；煩惱時，對着閃閃的燄光，可以忘懷一切。正如製煆商的廣告所說：「They　Satisyy」，我因為生活的亭受，所以吸烟，因爲吸煆，所以生活的亨受更能Ssatisyy。</p>
<p>我愛烟，對于煆的熱情却曾費去許多勇敢與毅力。我的女人就是第一個反對我吸烟，但我認為這是酸素的作用，我可沒有理會她。我的醫生斷定烟就是我心跳病的主因，屢次忠苦告我不要吸烟，甚至將煆來比洪水猛獸，可是我也沒有懾服于他的恐嚇。在不計利害輕重的原則內，我和烟甜蜜地相處了十多年。</p>
<p>一向自負是烟的知已，也承認烟是目己的情人。然而我終于和他接着永別前的最後一吻了。</p>
<p>與其說煆是失戀于我，無寧說是我失戀于煙。因爲我發覺我並沒有眞的認識了煆，並且常常侮辱了煙。</p>
<p>當我發覺我的煙句裏只餘一支煙，這就是我底精神糧食庫將近空虛的象微，于是我伸手向衣袋裏想掏出一張鈔票向十字街頭的灘子上找尋補充，我的指頭在衣袋裏却先觸着M寄給我的一封信，這突然使我想起了信裏面的一段說話。</p>
<p>『我們廿六日又從××開到××，步行四日四夜，山路又甚崎嶇，但我們全數都走到了目的地，沒有缺少一個人，我們又餓又渴又倦，幸得老百姓帮忙，茶飯接濟，甚爲踴躍，更有一位鄉公所的先生送給我一校土製的紙煆，我感激到幾乎哭了出來。』</p>
<p>深刻的印象在我底腦子裏轉着，我彷彿看到，在吸那枝土煆時眼角上掛着感激的淚珠，烟對于M，M對于煆他兩在生活的融和中提示了亨受的眞諦。</p>
<p>這使我　然于半生荒唐的自滿。我愛烟嗎？事實上是蔑辱了烟；我滿是于亨樂的生活嗎？這慘綠的頹廢？</p>
<p>在大時代的機輪中，一切被製鍊成有用的東西，烟，這日常被認為亨樂者的御用品，在某一個時期中也會如M所遇到的那麼光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>誰還醉心于亨樂，那誰就侮辱了烟，那誰就是大時的罪人。</p>
<p>我抽出最後的一枝烟，悚然地接着最後一吻，為了不再侮辱你，為了珍重我自已，我們永別了。永別了，烟！永別了，那亨樂的半生！</p>
<h3>記曹聚仁先生　（上）</h3>
<p>— 吳紫金</p>
<p>一　靑竹布褂</p>
<p>曹先生長年披件靑竹布褂，足登一雙沒油漆的黑皮鞋；有時許是兩隻烏布履。這社會原是講外表的，這個，他可就吃虧了。</p>
<p>在讌會席上，以至於到曁南大學上課，老爺式的嘉賓和公子哥兒式的大學生，都一口咬定他是下走的役爾，茶房。他很幽默地說過：「有時候也很想穿起筆挺的西服，戴架老爺眼鏡。」但他澈頭澈尾地仍舊是那身竹布褂，不分濃春溽夏，肅殺的秋與嚴寒的冬。</p>
<p>這人叫人家敬愛他，在全局中，這『素』字得給他打上一子。</p>
<p>二　治學的「老鼠」</p>
<p>用法國法郎士（Anatole　France）的一句話來說。這人是一頭「圖書館裏的老鼠」。這不但說他很廣泛他吞噬着書籍，而且說，他的治學像老鼠樣的「精」和「細」。</p>
<p>這人是在舊書堆裏成長起的，自然，他是化費過不少的精力在「故紙」上頭。但對於這門「國寶」，他並不是個服服貼貼的階下囚：相反地，他是像一位公正和機警的判官似的去處理它的。</p>
<p>世上有種人，眼光好比菜油燈，把一切的古書都捧作聖經，搖頭攏尾地死哼個不休，自己上當也不知道。這人所不齒的便是這種冬烘先生。卡萊爾說過：「讀者下，思者中，觀者上。」洽學沒有辨析的眼光可不行，冬烘先生就麼　地只懂得瞎讀，半點兒疑難的精神也沒有，終日讀書消磨一生，整堆整豐的古書却把他　成個下等的腐儒。一秀才舉人，」他說：一都是不通的賣貝。」這詁兒不見得過火龍？</p>
<p>他所不齒的弟二種讀書人，就是那『像戈壁的的沙漠的吸流水一樣，吸收了知識，却一泓淸泉也不能噴到地面上來的「書櫉一據說這人早年負笈杭州時，很欽式老據學者單不庵先生，但「支持了二十年之久」的信仰，後來終於一古腦兒坍掉了，就爲的這位單先生是　書櫉。</p>
<p>「我和單不庵師第二次相處於西湖省立圖書館裏（民國十六年）這一相處，使我對於他完全失了信仰，他是那樣地淵博。却又那樣地沒有一點兒自己的兒解：讀的書很多，從來理不成一個系統。」（文筆散策，我的讀害經驗。）</p>
<p>法國的散文家米賽爾·特·蒙田訕笑這種書好像是個需要火的人到鄰家去取火，但在那裏看見了堆熊熊的火燄，便留下取暖，忘記了帶回家去。（「我們拿別人的意見和學間來保存，就算完事了嗎？』他詰間地說：「即便我們腹中充滿了肉，於我們什麼益處呢？如們我們不能把它消化，如果我們不能把它變成我們的，如果不能增加我們的發育和力量。」（見　敎育）讀書首要的是永遠不要把別人的思想的渣滓銷緊了自己的腦子，像蒙田那样博洽，又那樣地有通達的見地，叫人悅服的就在這點。</p>
<p>曹先生也是這一類的讀書人，他在治學上的可敬佩的地方，還是用他自己的詁來說吧：（一）時時懷疑占人和古書，（二）有膽量背叛自己的父師，（三），組織我自的思想系統。　（未完）</p>
<h3>說人欲</h3>
<p>— 向天</p>
<p>讀書鏡卷九引楊升奄語說：</p>
<p>『大抵人自情中生，焉能無情，但不過甚而已』。</p>
<p>這是說人　當存在的根本理由，手聖賢的一寡欲養心，約情台中」的說法，正是互相發明。旣有人欲，即須有飮食男女，講女人的胭脂，塗口骨，一論跳舞，談風月等，就不能少，因爲這是人欲存在的台理表現，換一句摩登話，「整個人生」，抗戰期間又何能例外？</p>
<p>去年筆者曾有一篇論一個由上海來港，因游冰淹死在游冰塲上的靑平難民的事，大遭某派人的反對，他們說抗戰不能影響生活的，抗戰期內的生活不能加以限制的，他們舉出他們自以為極有理的理由說：「在瘋狂轟炸下的馬德里人民，還坐在影院裏看電影呢！」</p>
<p>這個據自信極有理由的理由，曾一時打倒了我從前　見解，使我迷惘了許久。於是我　讀美國專印女人大腿的圖片雜誌，講究女人塗手指的妙法，女人穿襪子的什麼論，跳舞絆等，因為我想似乎馬德里的人民也是如此的。前日讀前人　記，讓到一處說：「天之風月，地之花柳，與人之歌舞，無此不成三才」似乎風月也，花柳也，歌舞也，都更應當積極地去講究，否別就不成為「三才」了，於是理由上再加　由，我史確定了。</p>
<p>不過至今我還稍存疑惑的就是當講完了風月，花柳，歌舞，女人手套，高跟鞋與絲襪之後還做什麼呢？是　地去追求麼，還是間坐空講呢？抑空講完了跑到戰陣裏做夢呢？這些我還是不朋白。</p>
<h3>英雄頌</h3>
<p>— 黃魯</p>
<p>劍缺了，鎗銹了，</p>
<p>戰馬疲憊了，</p>
<p>征袍　撕碎了，</p>
<p>你的身體也受傷了，</p>
<p>但是呵，你雄風如昔，</p>
<p>眼睛像燎原之火，</p>
<p>灼灼地燃燒着我們的心臟。</p>
<p>你呵，自由底英雄！</p>
<p>願你早日安康，</p>
<p>再拾起更明亮的刀鎗，</p>
<p>重上戰塲！</p>
<h3>關於說書者</h3>
<p>— 拉特</p>
<p>每當無風無雨的晚上，在好些街邊巷裏，經常有着以說書爲活的壯年人在那裏各佔各人的據點，講述着古令中外的故事。街坊的勞苦大衆，有不少人都把這些說書的地方認為是　解他們自已的空閒煩悶的地點，或者是藉以恢復他們一天的疲勞的地方。</p>
<p>是的，街坊的勞苦大衆，壯年的，靑年的，老年的，都有不少人同樣的感到聽聽故事，似乎就是他們每晚之間應享的權利，從腰包裏挖出二兩枚銅板來。似乎也就是他們應盡的義務，那些說書人也好像已經擁有了他們的聽衆而應該盡着自己的職能努力地賣聲賣氣。</p>
<p>我們固然相信，有一個時期這些街坊的無數聽衆，曾經受着荒謬怪誕的神奇傳聞，光怪陸離的，低級趣味的野史所麻醉了頭腦。在一個眞為敎育大衆，為大衆奮鬥的人的眼中看來，無疑是感到非常的不滿，因爲這樣。說書者曾受着有識之士的鄙視興嫉駡，自然也是很難免的一囘事。</p>
<p>然而此時此際的戰爭高潮四面久擊起來，已經把這些說書者已講述內容少轉變了過來。他們所講的，而我們現在所能聽到的大槪是人民游擊戰爭的事實，國共合作的趣聞，蘇聯援助中國的情况，西班牙反法西斯的戰史，中　反漢奸，反主和者的陰謀等等，舉凡國內國外的種種消息，都經過了他們的翻造而成為了一篇鮮活的說書資料。中華民族戰爭的腥血，國際反法西期的巨潮，使他們這種進步的轉愛，無疑是可作為對於抗戰的宜傅的一個有效幫助。</p>
<p>然而我們還得要縝密的觀察精組的分析與　嚴的批判。</p>
<p>當我們從頭到尾聽着他們所講的整個內容而精密地老察起來的時候，我們就可發覺他們所把握的各方事相，所理解着的戰鬥現實，還是非常的糢糊，有時甚至歪曲了某一部份，僞造了某一部份而變成對抗戰有害的說敎。這對於無數的勞苦聽衆將會發生不良的影饗，這眞不能不使我們有所警惕了。</p>
<p>眞心做着救亡宣傅的朋友們，當着第二期抗戰宣傅戀該加緊的深入大衆的現在，當着應該多找着一些宣傅工作的助手的現在，我們對於這些正在轉變中的說書者，應該如何去提示他們，聯絡他們，勉勵他們正確的執行着抗戰的說書呢。這也應該說是我們的課題，而亦是我們要完成的宣專工作之一部呀。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>『你勇敢些，勇敢是一切成功的種子！』</p>
<p>這聲音，被一陣風送來，送進他的耳里，他淸醒了，像剛剛從夢中醒來一樣，抖了幾下冷戰，然接，他特意把食指貼緊衣袋里手槍的引鐵，輕快地走盡了小路，走進房門了。</p>
<p>房內，一望，彷彿是羅馬神殿的縮影，被璧燈閃照得像白畫一般明亮。</p>
<p>他把房內所見的一切和自已記憶中所保留的圖搽對照一下。立刻曉得那門的所在；於是，他像熟來的家人一樣，敲了門，便進去。</p>
<p>屋內，是華麗的；一切的裝置，都像經過歐洲家庭裝置家的手。淡綠的燈光，遮有淡綠的燈罩，罩的四圍，綉了深綠的中世紀羅馬的圓案。牆的一邊，正烯燒着壁爐，暴火已經染紅了爐門，不住地飛散着凌亂的紅星。屋內的色調和和温暖，使人感覺是春夏之間的季節。但是，這與寒冷而悲苦的世界隔絕的小天地間，却不見它的主人，而且，他以外空無一人。</p>
<p>一剎那間，他肩上，靴下帶來的積雪，完全溶成水滴，有的消逝在難見的衣縫的線紋間，有的零落在浸不透的地板上。</p>
<p>現在的一剎那，便是往常一年的長久。</p>
<p>他焦急地徘徊着，等待着；終于有些失望了。但是，又不肯失望地走開，不管成功，或是失敗；他必須得到箕中的一個結果。</p>
<p>在他看見衣架上的皮大衣和床下的套鞋的時候，相信這主人，絕對沒有外出二步。他在失望中，又漸漸地復活着希望。</p>
<p>幾乎五分鐘過去了，門外還未傳來脚步聲；聽見的，祇有另一房間的鋼琴聲音，彷彿有人在練習一支初彈的曲子：一時是不完整的節奏，一時又是殘缺了的音階。因此，他想：</p>
<p>『是　　？她在彈琴嗎？』　（七）</p>

<h3>Czech Partition and the European Situation</h3>
<p>Just as Chamberlain was expressing an optimistic view of the European situation and preparing to realize a new balance of power in Europe, the Czech crisis has suddenly turned serious in recent days. A telegram from Berlin on the 13th has already proven that "Czechoslovakia has made another major sacrifice" and that "Czechoslovakia has accepted Germany's demands and has been forced to partition again!" What is the significance of this event? What impact will it have on the future situation in Europe and the world? What understanding and preparations should we make regarding this event?</p>
<p>Since the Munich Conference last year, Czechoslovakia suffered its first partition. The German fascist chieftain gained control over Czechoslovakia in all areas and sectors, and the fascist poison spread deeply throughout the country. The most important reason for Czechoslovakia's suffering such a heavy sacrifice last year was the appeasement policy of the British and French rulers towards the aggressor nations. In particular, the French Daladier government, following Chamberlain's foreign policy, attempted to exchange the interests of its small allies for a guarantee from the aggressor nations to postpone the outbreak of a European war. This ultimately led to the automatic abandonment of the Franco-Czech mutual assistance treaty and the destruction of the Soviet-Czech mutual assistance treaty, causing Czechoslovakia to suffer the pain of actual national subjugation. The second important reason was that the Czech government did not trust the power of the entire nation to unite and prepare to fight to defend its homeland. Under international pressure, especially the pressure of France's breach of contract, it accepted humiliating conditions for a compromised peace in an attempt to maintain Czechoslovakia's nominal existence.</p>
<p>However, all policies of compromise and capitulation not only failed to achieve stability and peace, but in fact made the invaders even more rampant. Czechoslovakia, under the control of the German fascist terror, certainly experienced the pain of actual national subjugation. Even the British and French rulers keenly felt that the appeasement policy had increased the threat of the aggressor nations to Britain, France, and even all of Europe. Therefore, in the six months since the Munich Conference, the Czech people's movement to organize a united front against fascism and fight for freedom has been secretly growing. The united action of the British and French people against the appeasement policy has also been developing rapidly, and Poland has taken Czechoslovakia's compromise with Germany as a warning, beginning to change its policy and gradually moving towards the Soviet Union, the "guardian of world peace."</p>
<p>The development of this new situation has naturally been a cause of concern and unease for the German fascist chieftain! At the same time, the British and French rulers have not abandoned their policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy. The Spanish war has begun to intensify under the increasingly intensified manifestation of this policy by Britain and France. Italy's aggressive actions against French North Africa are becoming increasingly fierce. The entire European situation is becoming increasingly serious. All these new developments have led the German aggressors to believe that the time is ripe for further partitioning Czechoslovakia and establishing a base for eastward aggression. Thus, there is the recent conspiracy to instigate the Slovakian autonomy movement.</p>
<p>Although the Czech government struck at the German-instigated Slovak "independent autonomy" movement due to the surging tide of national anger against fascism and for freedom, on the one hand, the German fascist forces had already controlled the overall situation in Czechoslovakia. On the other hand, Germany further exerted pressure, implementing troop mobilization and a fierce anti-Czech movement. At the same time, it made demands on Czechoslovakia: (1) grant the Slovaks the right to self-determination, (2) dismiss the current Czech Minister of National Defense, General Syrový, and the Minister of the Interior, and (3) guarantee the German minority in Bohemia and Moravia protection. As a result, according to a Berlin telegram on the 13th, "Diplomatic sources here confirm that the government has accepted the Slovak demand for autonomy and the dismissal of Czech Defense Minister Syrový. News from the Czech capital also indicates that the Czech government has accepted the German government's demand to establish an independent Slovak state, or even to establish an independent Ruthenian state." The secession of Slovakia from Czechoslovakia has almost become an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>After the partition of Czechoslovakia, the Czech territory will shrink by more than one-third again and will be surrounded by Germany. With the activity of fascists internally, the Czech people's struggle against fascism and for freedom will naturally become more difficult. At the same time, the European situation will change again after Germany actually gains Slovakia. What we should pay attention to is that, first, because Hungary has joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact" and Slovakia has fallen under fascist rule again, Hungary and Poland have already bordered each other, and Poland and Romania will become targets of plunder. Second, the voices of Germany and Italy in Europe are becoming increasingly rampant, while the position of Britain and France in Europe and even the world is becoming increasingly low. Although the British and French governments are fantasizing about the organization of a new Locarno, they will ultimately inevitably sacrifice themselves to serve the aggressor nations of Germany and Italy. Third, since the future situation in Europe will become increasingly critical and the war crisis will become more serious, the conspiratorial activities of the Japanese aggressors in the East will inevitably become more intense. This is something we cannot ignore! Finally, we should more deeply recognize the consequences of the British and French appeasement foreign policy, and deeply recognize the disaster of Czechoslovakia's defeatist policy of seeking peace. Today's partition of Czechoslovakia is a warning to us—we must intensify the elimination of open and latent defeatist pro-peace and pro-× remarks and actions, strengthen national unity, vow to abide by the National Covenant, and adhere to the long-term resistance war.</p>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>On New Decisions in Military Resistance</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>The overall war situation is currently generally stable, but the overall situation has undergone major changes. The main facts of this change are that the internal and external difficulties of the × people are becoming increasingly serious, the offensive power of the × people has been greatly weakened, and we have established the foundation for a long-term resistance war strategically in the twenty months of bloody struggle, and have won the initiative; and politically, we have unfolded a bright future of long-term unity to strive for final victory. However, we must also understand that the difficulties of the × people and the degradation of the × army have not yet reached their highest degree; and that the × people are intensifying their military, political, and even economic conspiracies to complete their plan to quickly conquer China. Chiang Kai-shek's circular on the 12th of this month, therefore, used "the lifeblood of the nation and the race is still in the balance, and the success of the revolutionary nation-building cause is still extremely distant" to warn the national compatriots. Therefore, our task today is to adapt to the new situation of the war of resistance, to do our best to increase the difficulties of the × people, to prevent the advance of the × people, to crush the conspiracies of the × people, and at the same time to do our best to promote our national spirit, and to accelerate the growth of new forces, in order to achieve the goal of driving out the × people and recovering the lost territory.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from a certain place on the 13th from the Central News Agency, a certain director said that a certain important meeting recently convened has, in response to the current stage of the war of resistance, made important decisions on future military affairs. Generally divided into two aspects: active and passive. On the active side, in addition to deciding on precise tactics for the overall active war, it was also decided to take the troops to the front and rear of the × people with a spirit of dying for the nation to fight for national liberation. In order to counter the × people's recent use of military intimidation methods in their exhausted state to cover up the promotion of ×× politics and the expansion of insidious economic plans, it was decided to bravely defeat the main force of the × people militarily, and at the same time implement the National Covenant to crush the political tricks of the × people. Then, with the method of economic blockade, × commodities are not allowed to be transported into the inland, and our food products are not allowed to be transported into the ×-occupied areas. If this new decision, which advances on the military, political, and economic fronts at the same time, can be quickly implemented and further sought universally and practically, then the blow to the conspiracies of the × people will naturally be extremely serious. However, what we should understand is that the so-called military defeat of the main force of the × people not only depends on the improvement of the combat effectiveness of our Wang Force army and the active strengthening of the defense forces in Central China, South China, and the Northwest; but also depends on the counterattack on the flanks and rear of the × people by mobile corps with larger forces, and even greater efforts must be made to unify the organization and widely mobilize the guerrilla war in the occupied areas; this is one aspect. As for the political implementation of the National Covenant to crush the political conspiracies of the × people, it not only depends on the extensive and practical development of the traitor-elimination movement, but also on the resolute attack and eradication of all remarks and actions that violate the war of resistance and nation-building, such as all remarks and actions that advocate "anti-communism," "peace," "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and "exclusion of European and American forces"; at the same time, it is also necessary to expand the unified mass movement and implement democratic politics under centralized leadership, starting with the rapid establishment of provincial, municipal, and county councils, and fully develop the initiative and enthusiasm of the people across the country to participate in the war of resistance and nation-building; this is the second aspect. The economic implementation of mutual blockades must also be accompanied by the improvement of the necessary living standards for farmers and workers, the promotion of the economic resistance movement of the people in the occupied areas and war zones, and the accelerated development of industrial and agricultural production and cooperative enterprises in the vast rear areas in order to achieve complete success; this is the third aspect. All three of these points are what the authorities must pay attention to today, and what the compatriots across the country, especially the overseas Chinese, should do their best to contribute their loyalty, labor, and material resources to promote their success.</p>
<p>On the passive side, this meeting also made some rather important decisions, paying particular attention to the consolidation of political, cultural, and various other forces in order to coordinate with the two-pronged revolutionary tactics. Politically, it was decided to strengthen political institutions at all levels and consolidate revolutionary political institutions, and to enhance the strength of the masses in resisting the war. Culturally, it was decided to increase cultural work in resisting the war and promote the national spirit in order to raise revolutionary emotions. In terms of personnel, it was decided to follow personnel laws and regulations to select and appoint the virtuous and capable. In terms of management, it was decided to follow management laws and regulations to be honest and perform duties faithfully. Finally, simple and effective steps for leading troops, training troops, and using troops were formulated. These decisions are quite broad in scope, and there must be precise and concrete methods for them. However, they have already outlined the key points and provide us with a clear and optimistic basis for observing future military administration. Those who are concerned about the future of the war of resistance and nation-building and the national revolution will undoubtedly be pleased and look forward to their rapid realization. However, all these are, after all, the general and basic requirements for winning the war of resistance. For example, in terms of strengthening and consolidating political institutions and enhancing the strength of the masses in resisting the war, how to adjust the relationship between the various political parties, ethnic groups, and classes so that they can proceed smoothly under the organizational form of great national unity is still the most urgent issue at present. For example, in terms of strengthening cultural work in resisting the war, promoting the national spirit, and raising revolutionary emotions, how to clear the obstacles to cultural work in resisting the war, such as all the latent elements of compromise and peace and defeatists in the country, will be purged? How will all the traitorous remarks and actions overseas that serve Japan × and aim to attack the war of resistance and nation-building movement be swept away? All are the most serious problems at present. For example, in terms of implementing the selection of the virtuous and capable in personnel matters, the first thing to consider is how to break down partisan prejudices and crush the feudal tradition of appointing relatives and friends. For example, in terms of promoting honesty and public service in management, the first thing to consider is how to eliminate the remnants of feudalism? How to create an atmosphere that is adapted to revolutionary resistance? And so on. The government authorities must be able to see far and wide, resolutely make decisions, and provide a thorough solution. And our compatriots across the country who are loyal, patriotic, and courageous in self-love should also do their best to assist the government in perfecting the solution.</p>
<p>In addition, regardless of the current new military plan for the war of resistance, cultivating a large number of cadres and talents to work for the war of resistance and nation-building is the most urgent task for us today. Since the combat effectiveness of the × people has not been greatly depleted, the strategy of the × people has not suffered a fatal blow, and the conspiracies of the × people are still continuing to operate by taking advantage of every international opportunity and the remaining weaknesses of our side, it is true, as Chiang Kai-shek pointed out, that "the lifeblood of our nation and race is still in the balance, and the success of the revolutionary nation-building cause is extremely distant." Then we must step up the cultivation of human resources, develop new forces, in order to persist in the long-term resistance war and thereby strive for final victory. The formulation of simple and effective steps for leading troops, training troops, and using troops at this meeting is a clear indication that the authorities are paying attention to this. According to a late-night report on the 14th, Liang Han Cao, director of the political department of the Southwest Headquarters, said, "To refresh the political work cadres of the national army, a total of 60,000 people need to be trained. After six months of training, more than 5,000 people have graduated, and more than 10,000 people are currently undergoing training. At the same time, recruitment continues and is widely collected to achieve the goal of setting up one instructor per company and attaching a working team to improve the combat spirit of the soldiers. In the future, new troop training will pay more attention to political training." This decision by the authorities deeply meets the needs of previous appeals from all parties and 20 months of practical experience in the war of resistance. In addition to our satisfaction, we would like to offer a foolish insight: to improve the training of military political work cadres, we must first pay attention to the careful selection of trainers, focusing on those with rich experience and knowledge and a strong reputation among the people and in the troops, while disregarding their social class and partisan affiliations; secondly, regarding the recruitment of trainees, we should also abandon discrimination based on social class, ethnicity, or partisan affiliation, and focus on the degree of their national consciousness and revolutionary sentiments, and should especially encourage those who enthusiastically volunteer from overseas Chinese communities. If this can be done, then it can respond to the current military needs of the war of resistance, or it can be flexible and effective and achieve the expected results.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Provincial Military and Political Authorities Encourage People's Teams in the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Promote the Guangdong Spirit and Maintain the Inherent Glory; Strictly Abide by Revolutionary Discipline and Launch Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>[Quick News from a Certain Place] Zhang Fa Kui, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, Yu Han Mou, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and Li Han Hun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, issued a letter to the self-defense guerrilla teams in the occupied areas. The following is a transcript of the foreword: Fellow countrymen! Comrades:</p>
<p>It has been half a year since the Japanese × landed in Daya Bay and invaded our Guangdong on a large scale. During this half year, the × people have been rampant and unscrupulous in the occupied areas. ×× women, killing strong men and refugees, trampling on our fields and houses, and wantonly oppressing and enslaving our people, causing our compatriots to be displaced, wives and children to be separated, families to be destroyed, and people to die. The means of the × people are so poisonous and their conscience so evil that they are truly unprecedented in the world. During this half year, no one in the whole of South China has not been concerned about the situation of the compatriots in the occupied areas, and no one has not been heartbroken and vowed to avenge the compatriots who have suffered so much. Fa Kui and others have been entrusted by the Party and the country, shouldering the responsibility of military and political affairs in South China. We have never forgotten the suffering of our compatriots for a moment, and we have never ceased to encourage the military and civilians to fight against the Japanese × in order to eliminate the disasters of our compatriots and rescue them from the abyss of suffering.</p>
<p>Since the × people invaded South China, the self-defense corps and guerrilla teams in various parts of Guangdong have been able to understand the great righteousness and have risen up to participate in the war of resistance. Fa Kui and others, the military and civilians of South China, and the compatriots across the country all know very well about your heroic deeds of attacking the × people in various battles and disrupting the × people. Whenever such news comes, it is the glory of Guangdong people and also the glory of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Our Guangdong people have always been the vanguard in resisting foreign aggression. In the past, the Guangdong Taiping fishermen, the residents of Sanyuanli, and the people of Bao'an all rose up to resist the foreign troops that invaded our country, beating them into a rout and forcing them to withdraw from our territory. They established immortal achievements in the history of resistance against foreign aggression. Recently, in the War of Resistance against Japan, Wu Fa, a strong man from Zhongshan County, crossed the sea to attack the × bandits on Sanao Island several times. Hong Zhi Zheng, the captain of the self-defense corps in Chaoshan, led his team to overcome Nanao, killing the ×× so frightened that they lost their courage. Even Suma, the former Japanese consul in Nanjing, said: "The 'Guangdong Spirit' is the revolutionary spirit." From this, we can see how afraid the × bandits are of the public sentiment in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen! Comrades! You must carry forward this heroic spirit of the Guangdong people in resisting foreign aggression, promote the Guangdong people's spirit, and train your self-defense corps and guerrilla teams into iron anti-Japanese teams!</p>
<p>How can the local teams be transformed into iron anti-Japanese teams?</p>
<p>First, we must obey orders, strictly observe discipline, and cherish the people. If we do not obey orders and strictly observe discipline, we will not be able to fight. If we do not cherish the people, we will never be able to win the war. Everyone must not forget that we ourselves come from the people. After the war, we will return to the people. The local armed forces were originally the power of the people, so we must cherish the people, help the people, and pay attention to the interests of the people at all times. We must truly achieve the point of not disturbing the people or harming the people locally. We must pay the price for buying things, return what we borrow, and keep the places where we stay clean. We must speak kindly - only such a team can win the war.</p>
<p>Second, we must develop correct guerrilla warfare everywhere, attacking the × people everywhere and containing the × people. When we find small groups of × people, we annihilate them. When we encounter the × people's sentries or outposts, we become shameless collaborators and destroy them. When we discover the weaknesses of the × people, we give them a lightning strike that they cannot cover up, so that they do not have time to send reinforcements. When we seize the opportunity to attack the × army, we ambush them. Pay special attention to when they are unprepared, when they are camping or resting, and give them a powerful blow. If we encounter a large force of × troops and cannot win, we quickly disperse in a planned manner in order to regroup at a predetermined location later. When the × army comes to attack and cannot defend, we must destroy the nearby bridges and roads in advance, hide the food and daily necessities, and let both men and women escape to avoid being massacred by the × people, so that they come and find nothing. When they are stationed, we constantly harass them. When they retreat, we ambush and attack them along the way. We investigate the × people's communication lines and destroy them at any time and place. We pay attention to the × people's transportation everywhere, and when we have the opportunity, we intercept their baggage trains and cut off the supplies of their troops. Only by constantly attacking the × people in this way and resisting the × people in various ways can we make our troops healthy.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen! Comrades! You must recognize the true face of the × people and never forget that the Japanese × are the deadly enemies of our entire nation. Sometimes they abandon the policy of burning and killing in order to make us bow our heads and do their slaves, cattle, and horses, allowing them to drive and slaughter us. You must call on all the local compatriots to agree together and never be fooled by the bait and threats of the × people!</p>
<p>You must encourage each other from house to house, never be obedient people, never be collaborators, never use Japanese puppet banknotes, and never be slaves to the country.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen! Comrades! You must fight to the end resolutely. The compatriots across the country are waiting for you, asking you to endure humiliation and continue the war of resistance to the end. The government and the compatriots across the country will never let you down. We are concerned about your hard struggle, and we also cherish your future!</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen! Comrades! Carry forward the inherent glory of Guangdong, determine your fighting determination, and continue to attack the × people. Cooperate with the national army to resist the war to the end, drive the Japanese × out of the territory, and strive for final victory. So that our Chinese people and grandchildren can live permanently in equality and freedom in the world for all ages and thousands of years (National Salvation Society)</p>

<h3>During Flight from Chongqing to Kunming, Eurasia Passenger Plane Goes Missing: Sent a Distress Signal Near the Sichuan-Yunnan Border; Company Dispatched Aircraft for Two Days of Searching with No News; Passengers on Board Reportedly Include Tan Guang and 24 Others</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A certain large Eurasia Corporation aircraft, flying from Chongqing to Kunming on the 12th, suddenly went missing. The Eurasia Corporation immediately dispatched aircraft to search along the route, but as of 4 PM on the 14th, no official news has been received. It cannot be determined whether the aircraft has crashed or landed safely.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 14th] A Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane, which departed from here for Kunming on the 12th of this month, has been reported missing. The aircraft sent an emergency distress signal when it was flying near the Sichuan-Yunnan border. The aircraft carried 14 passengers, including Tan Guang, the chief secretary of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The Eurasia aircraft on the Chongqing-Yunnan route, carrying 14 passengers, took off from Chongqing on Sunday morning. It encountered an obstacle mid-flight and sent a distress call to Kunming. Subsequently, there was no further contact. As of yesterday, the aircraft had not arrived in Kunming, and it is suspected that it crashed en route. The aircraft is a "Junkers" type aircraft with 18 seats and three engines. The flight from Chongqing to Yunnan usually takes only four hours. After receiving the information, the reporter inquired with the Eurasia Aviation Corporation in Hong Kong. The person in charge replied that they had not received any reports from the aircraft, and only knew that the aircraft had departed from Chongqing on Sunday. The Kai Tak Airport authorities also stated that they had not received any news of the aircraft going missing. Since the outbreak of the war in South China, although Eurasia aircraft have flown from Kai Tak to the interior of China, most passengers travel via Hanoi. There are daily flights between Chongqing and Kunming. The number of Eurasia aircraft has recently been reduced to three, which is not enough to meet demand. Therefore, there was a proposal to add more passenger aircraft. Furthermore, it is known that the company's capital is a joint venture between the German Lufthansa company and the Chinese government. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Imperial Airways office announced that the company has reached an agreement with the South Vietnamese authorities and has obtained civil aviation rights. The only restriction is the regulations regarding domestic and ticket prices. In the future, Imperial Airways aircraft will be able to transport mail and cargo between Hong Kong and Hanoi, as well as carry passengers. The greatest impact will be the increased convenience of communication between Hong Kong and the mainland. Those traveling from Hong Kong to the mainland can take Imperial Airways aircraft to Hanoi and then transfer to China National Aviation Corporation or Eurasia aircraft.</p>
<h3>Empty Fields (Part 1): Valuable Experiences and Lessons in Northern Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>— By Baiyun, our correspondent in Xi'an</p>
<p>I. Significance</p>
<p>The policy of "Empty Fields" (a popular term for "Strengthening the Walls and Clearing the Fields," which has become common in various guerrilla areas in North China) is a clever method in our national revolutionary war, especially in guerrilla warfare, to strive for victory and exhaust the enemy.</p>
<p>This method has been widely used in various guerrilla areas in North China, especially in Shanxi, and has achieved significant results. In the process of its implementation, there are naturally many experiences and lessons that can serve as a reference for the development of guerrilla warfare in various war zones throughout the country.</p>
<p>What harm does the "Empty Fields" policy do to the enemy? What benefits does it bring to us?</p>
<p>First, the "Empty Fields" policy can deprive the enemy of all military conveniences when attacking us, such as using our people to act as guides, scouts, and perform all military service. It can deprive the enemy of the convenience of manpower and material resources in the occupied areas, such as capturing conscripts, requisitioning grain, fuel, livestock, etc. locally. This can create favorable conditions for us to annihilate the enemy. The enemy will either be eliminated by us along the way or be unable to gain a foothold after occupying an area, and will have no choice but to retreat.</p>
<p>Second, after repeated implementation of the "Empty Fields" policy, the enemy has had painful experiences. The next time they attack us, they will have to carry a large number of supply trains and mule teams to accompany the army and supply provisions. This will further encumber the enemy's march. In other words, it can create favorable conditions for us to attack the enemy and seize a large amount of their supplies.</p>
<p>Third, the "Empty Fields" policy can not only avoid the enemy's use of our material and human resources, but also avoid the enemy's burning, killing, and looting, which would cause great losses to our people. This can preserve our manpower and material resources, and thus maintain our strength for a prolonged war of resistance.</p>
<p>Fourth, the "Empty Fields" policy is not a passive escapism, but an active organization of the people to form genuine military-civilian cooperation and increase the strength of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>II. Methods</p>
<p>Passive methods of the "Empty Fields" policy: First, estimate the possible routes of the enemy's attack. Before the enemy reaches a considerable distance, mobilize the masses near these routes to first move heavy objects that are easily seized and easily destroyed by the enemy, such as grain and goods in shops, to pre-determined concealed locations. Secondly, the weak, the young, domestic animals, clothing, pots, bellows, bowls, dishes, firewood, etc. should also be hidden in an orderly manner. When the masses set out or move things, if there are sick, elderly, or weak people who are unable to walk, or if there are heavy objects that are not easy to move, strong men should be selected to organize stretcher teams or transport teams to assist. If there is grain, etc. that cannot be moved in time, it should also be destroyed to prevent the enemy from seizing it. For merchants, safe places should also be selected outside the village for temporary business.</p>
<p>Active methods: Passive methods only avoid losses. Active methods also involve inflicting various blows on the enemy. In addition to guarding the above-mentioned hiding places, the strong men must be organized to cooperate with the troops in combat. Even if some people are occasionally captured by the enemy, they should pretend to be deaf and mute and mislead the enemy, not serve the enemy, and further put the enemy at a disadvantage. Secondly, all the wells should be blocked, and paint should be poured into the ponds or upstream of nearby rivers to make the enemy suspicious and afraid to drink the water. Third, landmines and explosives should be buried in the villages, intersections, toilets, vegetable gardens, and other places where the enemy is expected to go and pass through. Bombs should be hung behind doors or on trees. Fourth, doors should be locked to make the enemy suspect that there are ambushes or explosives planted inside, and dare not enter.</p>
<p>III. Preparatory Work for Implementation</p>
<p>The "Empty Fields" policy is a difficult task. If not done well, it will not only fail to strike the enemy, but will also cause unexpected losses to oneself.</p>
<p>Political workers in the troops and personnel engaged in mass mobilization must, at all times, propagate and explain the significance of the "Empty Fields" policy to the people as much as possible so that the people understand. If necessary, practical exercises should also be conducted to cultivate rapid and orderly habits.</p>
<p>The government, troops, and people must be united and fully cooperate at all times. The government and troops must assist the people in implementing the "Empty Fields" policy with all their strength. For example, for the people's concealment work, it is necessary to organize them and make them act in an orderly manner. The safety of the concealment locations and the locations where grain is buried must be planned as safely as possible to protect the interests of the people. The distribution of food and lodging in the concealment locations and the amount of surplus grain and supplies that should be retained for the troops must be fully planned in advance to prevent the military and civilians from feeling a lack of food due to the "Empty Fields" policy. The route and time of the enemy's attack should be accurately estimated as much as possible based on correct intelligence to avoid the implementation of the "Empty Fields" policy being too late or too early, thereby affecting the safety of the people and military actions. If it becomes necessary to retreat, the people must be informed so that they are prepared. If the hiding place is discovered by the enemy, it must be protected as much as possible. When the people retreat, they must also cover up their retreat. Only in this way can the trust of the people be obtained, can genuine cooperation between the military, government, and people be achieved, and can the effect of the "Empty Fields" policy be achieved.</p>
<p>In summary, the government and troops must have a plan for the "Empty Fields" policy and must not panic when the time comes. Second, there must be steps and they must not flee in a disorderly manner. Third, there must be leadership and the people must not consider the "Empty Fields" policy to be a simple form of fleeing, thus losing its active political significance.</p>
<p>IV. Results Achieved</p>
<p>In October of last year, when the enemy attacked the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region; in December of last year, when the enemy attacked western Shanxi; in January of this year, when the enemy attacked southeastern Shanxi; and in other large and small battles in North China in the past, the "Empty Fields" policy was often one of the important conditions for our victory. In those places, there was always preparation for the "Empty Fields" policy. Therefore, when the sound of the enemy's attack began, the villages near the enemy-occupied areas could generally implement the "Empty Fields" policy in an orderly manner, making the enemy's march cautious and therefore extremely slow. After arriving at or occupying a place, not to mention having nothing to eat, they could not even find firewood, and as a result, they had no choice but to retreat. The retreat of the enemy in Ji County, Liao County, Heshun County, and other counties was mainly determined by our resolute combat, but the role of the "Empty Fields" policy was also very significant. Although the enemy in Wutai occupied the county seat, it was only an empty city that was of no use. Even a match was later transported by the enemy from elsewhere.</p>
<p>In early October of last year, the enemy occupying Fuping County in northwestern Hebei could not find a single civilian or obtain a single grain of food. They had to use a large number of trucks to transport supplies from Ding County, which gave us the opportunity to attack the enemy's supplies along the way. In the Dangcheng Wangkuaizhen area, we intercepted a large number of the enemy's supplies, making it impossible for the enemy in Fuping to stay for long. Therefore, they withdrew in parts, and we eventually recovered the county seat.</p>
<p>In early October of last year, the enemy attacking the Bailan Railway in northeastern Shanxi had more than 300 camels and mules in their supply train accompanying the army. As a result, they were all seized by us, and military victory was quickly achieved. These are all the effects of the "Empty Fields" policy. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Afforestation in Southwestern Jiangxi: Hosted by the Agricultural College</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 13th] The relationship between forests and the nation is important and an indispensable factor in national defense.

<p>The college's future forestry development policies are: (1) In addition to afforestation in this province, attention will also be paid to local forestry, encouraging private afforestation, promoting cooperative afforestation, and promoting afforestation in rural townships and baojia units. (2) Surveying forests and barren forests, and then focusing on cultivating firs, larches, birch, linden trees, and other timber suitable for building aircraft, as well as military wood.</p>
<h3>Japanese People's Lives are Deteriorating; Anti-War Sentiment is Spreading Throughout the Country; The Japanese Cabinet's Statistics Bureau Provides a Self-Indictment; First-Hand Observation by a Third-Country Writer</h3>
<p>Twenty Months of Invasion of China: The Situation of Japanese Hardship</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 14th] According to a survey by the Cabinet Statistics Bureau, the cost of living index for salaried and wage-earning classes in Japan in February was higher than in July 1937 (by 15%). The cost of living index for the wage-earning class in 24 major Japanese cities in February of this year was 115.3 (July 1937 was the base month), an increase of 0.8% compared to January and 9% compared to February 1938. Furthermore, the cost of living index for salaried classes in 11 major Japanese cities in February of this year was 114.6, an increase of 1% compared to January and 8.6% compared to February 1938.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A New York dispatch: The February issue of the Commentary magazine recently published an article by Hauser entitled "The Japanese Awakening from the Dream," describing the author's firsthand observations of the plight of Japanese soldiers in Japan and the phenomenon of anti-war sentiment spreading and causing unrest.</p>
<p>It first describes a wounded soldier being sent back from China. Because the soldier had broken legs and arms, he was placed in a wooden barrel. The soldier begged to be spared, but was refused and bit his tongue to commit suicide. Japanese newspapers absolutely prohibited the publication of this news, but almost everyone in the country, from Hokkaido to Kagoshima, knew about it.</p>
<p>It then describes the tragic scene of Japanese soldiers being sent to war and the domestic control of war news. What the general public sees in the newspaper every day is the following: "Under the command of Lieutenant So-and-so, the XXX unit advanced from its position to XXX before dawn at X o'clock, occupied the walled city, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, and we suffered no casualties." But it is unknown what XXX represents.</p>
<p>On one occasion, a soldier on the front lines in China sent a letter to his relatives and friends discussing the situation on the battlefield and the suffering from a lack of food. It was intercepted by the authorities, creating the so-called "strange incident of front-line letters." Since then, such letters have not been able to reach the recipients.</p>
<p>There is also the so-called "strange incident of comfort bags." Because the military wanted to boost morale on the front lines, it ordered the people to prepare comfort bags containing whiskey, cigarettes, soap, toothbrushes, books, etc., and send them to the front to comfort the soldiers. However, it was recently discovered that the comfort bags contained anonymous letters of anti-revolutionary propaganda, advising the soldiers to stop fighting, return home, and raise their wives and children. This was done by university students. Because they were discovered by the police, the comfort bags were also banned.</p>
<p>It then describes the abuse of wounded soldiers by Japanese military doctors and the reasons for the mutiny of the Japanese army on the Yangtze River front line, stating briefly that there were not enough Japanese soldiers, and wounded soldiers could hardly be allowed to leave the front line for too long. Therefore, as soon as the wound healed, the medical officer would order them to return to the front line. This situation was especially common in the Yangtze River, where the Japanese army suffered particularly heavy losses. Military doctors were often met with stubborn resistance, which led to mutiny. However, such incidents of discontent are all kept secret and should not be disclosed.</p>
<p>It further describes the various ugly behaviors of the Japanese army, such as collapsing military discipline and depressing morale, and the psychological state of the Japanese army's war weariness. It finally describes the situation of resistance to conscription and mutiny in various counties and villages, and the author's personal observations of returning soldiers with disheveled hair and dirty faces, and the uneasy state of the audience in Shimonoseki and Osaka, predicting that the Japanese people have reached the point of exhaustion. Under the high pressure of the warlords, a great revolution will inevitably break out in the near future. When the author was in Tokyo, he was allowed to visit the largest military hospital, so the situation he described is extremely real.</p>

<h3>The Resources Commission Develops Mineral Resources in Yunnan Province; Designates Dongchuan Mining Company to Undertake the Project; New Mining Machinery Has Been Transported to Yunnan</h3>
<p>[Kunming Correspondence] My Resources Commission, as the foundation for building the country through resistance against aggression, recently submitted a request to the Central Government to allocate funds to develop the rich resources of Yunnan Province. This was approved by the Central Government, and 1 million yuan was allocated as the first phase of operating expenses. The Yunnan Provincial Government then allocated 1 million yuan, bringing the total capital to 2 million yuan, and a large-scale Yunnan Northern Mining Company was jointly established to develop resources. This matter is actively underway. After several meetings, the Dongchuan Mining Company, which previously had the most successful operations, was designated to take over the project. The Luoxue, Simin, and Maolu areas of Dongchuan were designated as the first phase of mining areas under its jurisdiction. These areas produce the most copper and other minerals. The latest mining machinery and materials ordered from a certain European country were partially shipped from Yangon via a certain highway on the 3rd of this month and arrived in Kunming.

<h3>Japanese Legislators Point Out That the People Are Panicked; Deeply Afraid of the Outbreak of War Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Questions Arise in the Japanese Diet</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 14th] Foreign News: Questions are arising in the Diet, indicating that general public opinion feels extremely pressured by China's heroic resistance. Yesterday, when the House of Representatives discussed the army and navy budgets, legislators raised questions one after another. Legislator Mitamura stated that the current general public opinion in the country desires an end to the war. Is this sufficient to represent the government's opinion? He pointed out that there is considerable panic in the country, and a deep fear that conflict with other countries may occur before the war against China is over, and said, "Can the war against China be ended as soon as possible in order to cope with another war?" Army Minister Itagaki replied that the government is determined to fundamentally resolve the "incident" this time, but the government cannot publicly announce in the House of Representatives how to accomplish this arduous task. He also said that if the relationship between China, Japan, and Manchuria can be strengthened, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union can be eased, but unless China's communists are completely eliminated, the threat from the Soviet Union can still hardly be avoided. At the same time, Minei replied to a question that friction caused by the implementation of Japanese national policy cannot be resolved through diplomatic discussions. The Japanese Navy should take cautious measures.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 13th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita discussed the issue of the Soviet-Japanese fishery treaty negotiations in the House of Peers yesterday, saying that if the Soviet Union disregards Japan's legitimate demands, the Soviet Union should bear the consequences. He further stated that the Japanese government is openly and firmly prepared to take all effective and necessary measures to safeguard Japanese interests and deal with substantive incidents.</p>

<h3>German Troops Pressure the Border; Czechoslovakia Submits Again; Syrový Dismissed, Government Reorganized; Slovakia and Other Two Groups Declare Independence</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Bratislava, 13th] After 8 PM tonight, a serious riot occurred in the square between the National Theater and the Carlton Hotel in this city. Police ordered large groups of Slovak nationalists and pro-independence demonstrators to disperse, but they refused to leave, shouting slogans such as "We demand independence." The police then used bayonets, tear gas, and bombs to force them to leave.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 13th] According to reports from Bratislava, a major riot broke out after the conclusion of a meeting of the Hlinka Guard today. Troops were dispatched to suppress it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bratislava, 13th] Three bombing incidents occurred here tonight, killing six people. One bomb exploded on the Danube Bridge, killing two and injuring three. The second bomb exploded at a German shoe factory, killing four. The third bomb exploded on Leicester Street, with no casualties. Demonstrations dispersed at 10 AM. Mark spoke from the terrace of the Carlton Hotel, saying that he had received a telegram from Tiso, stating that "the Slovak problem has been resolved."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 14th] Slovakia has formally declared independence. Tiso will serve as President and Prime Minister, with Dukanský and many others who were arrested and imprisoned serving as cabinet members. Reports from Vienna state that German troops have already invaded Slovakia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bratislava, 14th] After secret consultations between the Slovak Cabinet and top leaders, Slovakia formally declared independence. The first step of the new government was to send a telegram to Hitler, appealing for assistance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] According to reliable sources, Carpatho-Ukraine has also declared independence. The new Prime Minister, Volosin, has also telegraphed Hitler and Mussolini, appealing for assistance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 14th] German troops will enter Slovakia within hours. This morning, vehicular traffic here was temporarily interrupted as large numbers of fully armed troops passed through the streets, heading towards the Slovak border. When reporters asked a German official spokesman when the invasion of Slovakia would begin, he replied, "It is not yet time," but added, "This is certainly possible."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 13th] Diplomatic circles here have confirmed that the Czech government has accepted the demands for Slovak autonomy and the dismissal of Czech Defense Minister General Syrový. These demands were made by Tiso and Dukanský after they flew to Berlin to meet with Hitler. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler is determined to make it clear to the world that Germany will be the sole arbiter of Czech politics from now on. According to Czech sources, the Czech government has accepted Germany's demands, allowing Slovakia to become independent, and may have even allowed Ruthenia to become independent. It is said that the Slovak government will officially announce this at a meeting tomorrow. At the same time, the Czech government has also agreed to dismiss General Syrový and reorganize the cabinet. Furthermore, a Central News Agency dispatch from Prague on the 14th states that the Czech cabinet has resigned.</p>
<p>[Haitong, Prague, 13th] As rumors of the imminent resignation of the Czech government grow, the situation here has become even more tense. These rumors state that not only will the Czech cabinet resign, but also President Hácha will resign to take responsibility, as Hácha bears considerable responsibility for the actions of the Czech police authorities. It is said that the new cabinet will be headed by General Gajda.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 14th] Former Slovak Prime Minister Tiso returned to Bratislava by plane from Berlin today. A cabinet meeting was convened immediately after Tiso's arrival, with both Tiso and Tosi attending. Tiso also described the results of his talks in Germany. After the cabinet meeting, several key Slovak parliamentarians held a private meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Prague, 14th] The new Slovak Prime Minister, Sidor, was originally scheduled to come here yesterday morning to hold talks with the central government's standing committee on the current situation. However, due to increasing internal difficulties, he was unable to do so. This shows that the situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] Tiso and Dukanský arrived in Berlin from Vienna by special plane today. After leaving the plane, the two immediately traveled by car to the Foreign Ministry to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and then to the Chancellery to meet with Hitler. As for what Tiso and others discussed with Hitler, it is being kept strictly secret. Afterwards, an official announcement was issued, stating briefly that "all outstanding issues" were discussed. However, according to other sources, Hitler may make demands or suggestions to Prague tonight.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 13th] According to semi-official sources, Tiso has notified Dr. Holcha that the Slovak Parliament will be convened at 10 AM tomorrow in Bratislava, and said that Tiso's actions were initiated after meeting with Hitler. Dr. Holcha has complied. The Slovak Parliament will discuss the future of Slovakia. Germany has made three demands to the Czech central government: (1) grant Slovakia the right to self-determination and autonomy; (2) remove the current Czech Defense Minister General Syrový and the Minister of the Interior; and (3) guarantee that the German minority in Bohemia and Moravia receive full protection.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] It is widely rumored here that Hitler will make demands or suggestions to Prague today. Germany firmly believes that the Czech government will not reject them, so the entire European crisis can be avoided. It is believed that Germany's plan is to promote the autonomy of Slovakia and Carpatho-Ukraine and protect the lives and property of Germans. It is rumored that the Prague government will resign.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Munich, 13th] The large-scale movements of German troops in Bavaria in recent weeks have attracted attention from all parties. This matter is now a topic of discussion everywhere, most notably in Salzburg. The movements between Nuremberg and Munich are also quite frequent. The troop movements are all mechanized, with light artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and armored vehicles.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 13th] German Air Minister Göring, who has been here on vacation, suddenly returned to Berlin by car this afternoon. It is generally speculated that Göring's sudden return to the German capital is related to the Czech situation.</p>
<p>Germany's Malicious Remarks; Czech Government Lodges Protest</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th] Germany is now taking this opportunity to force the Czech Republic to submit, so that it can resolve the Czech problem once and for all. The Nazi Party newspapers are heavily stirring up hatred of the Czech people, in a manner similar to September of last year, when Czech-German relations were strained. The demands that Germany is considering making include: (1) the Czech government must renounce the Soviet-Czech alliance; (2) the Czech Republic must join the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The Czech situation has recently been commented on by individuals close to the German Foreign Ministry, stating that the internal affairs of the Czech Republic are extremely chaotic. The faction of former President Beneš, encouraged by Roosevelt, wants to renege on the rights of autonomy previously granted to the Slovak and Ukrainian peoples. It can be seen from this that the Czech Republic has not yet learned the lesson it received six months ago. In political circles, it is said that Germany's intention is only to strengthen the autonomy of the Slovak people, and does not want the complete separation of the Slovak province, for several reasons: (1) After the province's separation, it will completely fall into the German sphere of influence. If that were the case, the world would see German foreign policy as having imperialistic overtones, and would have a negative impact on Germany's various states; (2) The Czech federal system still maintains its original form, and the financial deficit of the Slovak province can be borne by the country's central government. After separation, Germany may have to bear the responsibility for it. Another faction in political circles advocates a thorough solution to the Slovak problem as a once-and-for-all solution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th] The struggle between the Czech and Slovak peoples is highly valued in semi-official circles here, which speak up for the Slovak people, stating that the actions of the Czech central government are completely contrary to the policies advocated by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration (the arbitration document regarding the demarcation of the Czech-Hungarian border). The methods of the former Beneš era have reappeared today, which is beyond our country's expectations, and therefore we are concerned, with good reason. The policies led by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration were intended to build a new Central Europe and put an end to the original state of affairs in the Balkans. Who would have known that the current policies of the Czech government authorities are completely contrary to this goal, and they seem to have lost their sense of reason and responsibility.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 13th] The government here is preparing to send a note to Berlin protesting against the anti-Czech propaganda of the Vienna radio station and the anti-Czech remarks of the German press.</p>
<p>Britain and France Exchange Views; Do Not Intervene in the Situation</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] Two hours after Hitler and Tiso discussed making demands on the Czech government, Halifax told a Conservative parliamentarian that the UK "does not wish to interfere with other countries together." This seems to indicate that Britain will not get involved in the complex disputes of Central Europe. After Halifax made this statement, he exchanged views with France and confirmed that the borders of Czechoslovakia, guaranteed by the Four Powers, no longer exist, and said, "Even if the guarantee were still valid, it would only apply to aggression, and not to separation."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Phipps this afternoon to discuss the situation in Czechoslovakia. According to responsible sources, although the Munich Agreement states that the borders of Czechoslovakia should be guaranteed by Britain and France, it has not yet come into effect due to certain conditions that have not been met. Based on this, no matter how the situation in Czechoslovakia evolves in the future, Britain and France will naturally have no intention of intervening.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today on the Czech situation, stating that according to reports he has received, there have only been minor conflicts in Bratislava in the past few days, and the overall situation appears to be quite calm on the surface.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 14th] Officials here are keeping silent on the Czech situation. According to well-informed sources, Britain has no promise to guarantee the integrity of Czech territory. Even if there is an agreement on protection, it must be in response to external forces invading the Czech Republic, and it is definitely not an intervention in Czech internal affairs. For the time being, British interests are not affected by the Pressburg incident. Regarding the Czech question, the British government is maintaining close ties with the French authorities, but has not yet decided on joint measures to deal with it. The Czech government has also not sent a formal report to the British side.</p>
<h3>Japan Destroys North China's Monetary System; Britain and the United States Both Protest; British Under-Secretary Says Yangtze River Problem is Serious; Has Discussed Solutions with Fleet Commander</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] US Under Secretary of State Welles announced today that the United States has protested against Japan's implementation of the "new monetary system" in North China, especially against the forced circulation of Japanese currency in the hope of banning Chinese currency.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] British Under-Secretary Butler reported in the House of Commons today that the puppet organization in North China has announced that from March 11, the export of twelve types of special goods will be prohibited unless they have a certificate proving that all foreign exchange has been sold to the puppet reserve bank at a price of one shilling and two pence per yuan. The above-mentioned special goods account for the bulk of North China's exports. The British government has protested to the Japanese government about this matter, stating that the currency measures implemented by Japan in North China clearly infringe upon legitimate British commercial interests.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Information has been received here that there is a pro-Japanese terrorist organization outside the Tianjin concession. The task of this organization is to launch terrorist incidents in the concession and then flee outside the concession. It is generally expected that the British government will lodge another protest with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Member of Parliament Moore-Brabazon asked the government authorities in the House of Commons whether the Prime Minister would pay attention to the fact that over a hundred British nationals in Hankou now want to go to Shanghai, and that British nationals in Shanghai also need to go to Hankou for commercial reasons, and what measures would be taken to ensure their safe and rapid arrival. Butler replied that this matter has attracted the attention of Foreign Secretary Halifax, and that active measures are being taken. Moore-Brabazon also asked whether the Under-Secretary should discuss with the commander of the China Fleet whether British ships are not allowed to trade in the Yangtze River basin, and British people are not allowed to travel on Japanese ships, so that this international waterway can be reopened. Butler said, "The government, in view of the seriousness of this matter, will certainly consult with the aforementioned parties in earnest."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The newly appointed British military commander in Shanghai, Colonel Simonds, is scheduled to depart for Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>22 Protests Due to Losses of British Nationals</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Under-Secretary Butler said today in the House of Commons in response to questions that since the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the British government has filed 22 protests with the Japanese government regarding the material losses suffered by British nationals, of which 9 have received apologies, 4 have received compensation and payments, and 3 have promised compensation. When asked about the Japanese government's reply to the note on the "Open Door Policy" in China, Butler said that this was a statement by the British government based on the Japanese side's policy declaration on the Far East issue. Whether or not to reply is up to Japan, so no reply has been received to date. As for the bombing of the British hospital in Xi'an, Butler said that the hospital was hit by three bombs, and the hospital and the surrounding area suffered heavy losses. The British flag was marked on the buildings here. It is estimated that one Chinese nurse was killed on the spot. As for foreign personnel, it is said that they are all safe. The government authorities have lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government about this matter and reserve the right to demand compensation for all losses. When asked about the Japanese demand that the Guanghai Customs replace 32 positions with Japanese personnel, Butler said that the Foreign Secretary has received this information, but has not heard of the extent to which this request has been accepted. However, the British government believes that such personnel changes are purely a temporary measure, and this issue will still be seriously considered after the end of the war. Butler said that the bridge built by the Japanese across the Haihe River in Tianjin has been completed and opened to traffic on March 10. This bridge connects the Italian and Japanese concessions and is located upstream of the British and French concessions, so the British government has no need to lodge representations on this matter.</p>
<p>British Under-Secretary Reports on the Situation in the Tianjin Concession</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Under-Secretary Butler reported on the situation in the Tianjin concession in the House of Commons, saying that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie delivered a note to the Japanese Foreign Minister on March 4, pointing out that the attitude adopted by the authorities of the British concession in Tianjin was cautious and correct, and also mentioning the various excessive actions taken by the Japanese side against the British concession. Later, he asked the Japanese government to instruct the local Japanese officials to adopt a more moderate attitude as soon as possible. Member of Parliament Peake asked whether it was correct to say that the British concession in Tianjin had gradually become a concentration camp for the Japanese. Butler replied, "No, it certainly won't be like that. However, the seriousness of the Tianjin concession will not be reduced by my reply." In response to another question, Butler said that the Zhongda Yarn Factory in Suzhou has now been occupied by a Japanese yarn factory, and went on to deny that the British factory owner, the British Ambassador, had protested to the Japanese government again, and that the Japanese government had therefore instructed the Japanese side in Shanghai again, and that a solution might be obtained thereafter. When asked if the Under-Secretary was aware that this was just one example of the confiscation of British property, Butler said that he was personally aware of the difficulties, but as far as this example was concerned, he had described his negotiation steps in detail. He hopes to obtain a solution from this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the erection of barbed wire fences around the British and French concessions in Tianjin by the Japanese military authorities, after the British consulate lodged a protest, the Japanese authorities have recently submitted a reply, which is being studied by the relevant departments of the British Foreign Office. According to diplomatic sources, the content of this reply only repeats the previous explanation, briefly stating that the concession authorities have no intention of cracking down on anti-Japanese activities, and the Japanese authorities have no choice but to take action.</p>
<h3>Australian Commonwealth Announces Establishment of National Defense Council</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Melbourne, 13th] The Australian Commonwealth Prime Minister announced today the establishment of a National Defense Committee to plan measures to defend the people.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Discusses the International Situation; Foreign Governments Order the Spreading of Rumors; Hope that the British People Will Distinguish Facts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, March 3rd] Foreign Secretary Halifax, in a statement on the international situation in the House of Lords today, said, "Lately, it has been filled with alarming rumors, and it is truly feared that some people cannot distinguish facts from rumors. This kind of disregard for facts and deliberate spreading of rumors may suit a certain type of person, but it shows that the responsibility of the newspapers is very important, especially in Britain, where we enjoy complete freedom of the press. I hope that those who write and read news will give careful consideration to reports ordered by foreign governments. As we strive for peace, we must continue to take all necessary steps to strengthen our confidence and increase our strength. We do this as other great powers do, because we want to maintain independence on equal terms, and we believe that we can build a better world together with other countries. If we are to fulfill our primary obligations to our people, we will never neglect the opportunity to cooperate amicably with foreign countries, to eliminate all misunderstandings and doubts, and to strengthen the forces working for peace."</p>

Another rider states that the countries that order the armaments must not resell them to other countries, but this does not apply to countries that are one of the American republics. It is reported that the bill has been passed.</p>
<h3>Britain Does Not Want to Change the League of Nations Organization</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] In the British House of Commons today, Peake, in reply to a question, stated Britain's attitude towards the current organization of the League of Nations. He said that although in the past situations have occurred where the League of Nations was tasked with events that it was unable to handle, resulting in the League of Nations being unable to perform, the British government fully understands the value of the League of Nations organization, as its value lies in promoting international consultation and cooperation. The government will not neglect any practical measures to promote its functions. The British government does not want to change the existing organization and objectives of the League of Nations.</p>

French newspapers such as Le Populaire, L'Humanité, and Le Travail all emphasized the warm welcome of the delegates to Comrade Stalin and other party and government leaders. The London Times was headlined "Soviet Foreign Policy." An editorial cited Comrade Stalin's declaration that the Soviet Union defends peace and strengthens its commercial relations with all countries. If these countries maintain the same relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will maintain this position. The newspaper also quoted a passage from Comrade Stalin's report, stating that the Soviet Union provides full assistance to countries that have become victims of aggressors and is prepared to respond to provocations of war with a double blow.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Congratulations to the Council Meeting of Academia Sinica</h3>
<p>Academia Sinica is the highest academic research institution in the country. In the past, under the leadership of Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Messrs. Ren Hongjun and Weng Wenhao, it made great contributions to the Chinese academic community. Now that the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction have entered a new stage, all matters related to cultural work and academic thought should be concentrated on serving the cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We are pleased to learn that the third council meeting of Academia Sinica opened on the 13th. We sincerely hope that this meeting will establish the guiding principles for cultural work and academic research for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, based on the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the People's Political Council, as well as the basic spirit of the leader's recent proclamations. At the same time, it should be coordinated with the General Mobilization Outline of National Spiritual Strength, and concrete plans and measures should be formulated for how to promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, how to improve the academic research atmosphere of the people across the country, how to develop the national revolutionary cultural movement, and how to make culture and academics strive for the thorough realization of the revolutionary Three People's Principles, and should be earnestly implemented to achieve practical results. The gentlemen participating in the council meeting are not only advancing the national academic community, but most of them are also responsible leaders in the government. It is deeply hoped that during the severe and tense meeting, they will make great contributions to ensuring victory in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction and realizing national liberation.</p>
<h3>Escalating Tensions in Soviet-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>The Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement has expired, and the Soviet Union has decided to auction off fishing grounds today (March 15th). While the Soviet Union is determined to adhere to a position of maintaining peace and avoiding any steps that could lead to war, in the Soviet-Japanese fisheries dispute, the Soviet side is confident in its justification. Even if taking strong measures leads to more serious disputes, Japan should bear the responsibility. This is the consensus of all parties, therefore it can be asserted that the Soviet Union will not compromise today. So, what will Japan do? According to news released today, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita declared on the 2nd, "If the Soviet Union does not consider Japan's reasonable demands," adding, "The Japanese government has already prepared to take the most effective and sufficient measures in the event of the most unfortunate situation, and resolutely defend Japan's interests." Japanese Navy Minister Yonai also stated at a parliamentary session on the 13th, "If disputes arising from the implementation of Japanese ethnic policies cannot be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, the Japanese Navy will be forced to give it full consideration." The Japanese side's unreasonable arguments are evident from this.</p>
<p>So, will the war between the Soviet Union and Japan move towards an outbreak stage from today onwards? This still requires careful observation. The first thing to note is Japan's strength, which is increasingly strained in China. How can it wage war against the Soviet Union? This can be clearly seen from the questioning about the army and navy's supplementary budget during the Japanese parliament on the evening of the 13th. When Mawamura, a member of the Daiwakai, questioned how Japan could engage in war with another country, Army Minister Itagaki only replied that the government was "determined to seek a fundamental solution," and was unable to say how to resolve it.</p>
<p>However, we should be even clearer that Japan's loud and tough stance against the Soviet Union today is primarily aimed at stimulating domestic morale, easing anti-war sentiment, and responding to German and Italian activities in Europe, while plotting to seize opportunities in the Far East. At the same time, it is especially important to note that by pretending to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, it is spreading rumors of suspending the invasion of China, in order to facilitate the activities of pro-Japanese peace advocates, to weaken our resistance, and to facilitate its new offensive. We firmly believe that the Soviet Union will eventually deal Japan an even greater blow. We must be vigilant against the "peace" conspiracy and persist in resisting to the end.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Patriots, Four Batches of Mechanics Return to Serve the Country, Totaling 169 People Arrive in Hong Kong During the Day, Another Indian Doctor Voluntarily Comes to China to Serve</h3>
<p>Since we launched the full-scale War of Resistance, overseas Chinese, in addition to enthusiastically donating and assisting the government in the war effort, many passionate individuals have spared no sacrifice and returned from afar to serve the country. In the past year or so, those who have transited through Hong Kong to serve on the front lines have come in a steady stream. According to reporters, there are now four batches of mechanics returning to Hong Kong from Southeast Asia, one is the Perak Mechanics Service Corps, one is the Malaya Mechanics Service Corps, one is the Raub Mechanics Service Corps, and one is the Muar Chinese Mechanics Service Corps. They have already departed in batches and will arrive in Hong Kong during the day. After a short stay, they will transfer to the front lines or rear to serve. The Perak Mechanics Service Corps is organized by the Perak Relief Committee and currently has 126 drivers. Doctors are now examining their physical fitness and processing their return to the country. Once completed, they will return to the country from Singapore by ship, first to Hong Kong, and then transfer to the mainland. It is expected to depart at the end of this month or early next month. Most of these mechanics have professions and are skilled in driving, and many are also skilled in repairing machinery. This time, an Indian doctor will also come with the corps to serve the country, out of righteous indignation and sympathy for our country's resistance, and will be sponsored by the local Nam Hoi Association. Second, the patriotic overseas Chinese in Malaya have never lagged behind. Many have recently passed through Hong Kong to return to the country to serve as frontline medical personnel. The currently organized Mechanics Service Corps has eight members and one leader. They are currently raising travel expenses, and all travel equipment is ready. It will be established in the coming days and will first go to Hong Kong to await the command of our government to serve. Third, the Raub Mechanics Service Corps was recently organized by order of the National Government. The corps has a total of ten members, mostly car drivers and a small number of repair mechanics. They have all arrived in Singapore and will soon return to the country by ship. Fourth, the Muar Chinese Mechanics Service Corps, a group of 24 people, has been organized and departed for Singapore by ship on the 7th of this month, waiting for a ship to return to the country, and will arrive in Hong Kong in the coming days. Most of the members of this service corps are car drivers with excellent driving skills. They have undergone considerable training in Muar before departing. When they left Muar, they received a warm send-off from overseas Chinese organizations. Hong Kong overseas Chinese organizations, such as the Chinese Machinery Association, the Motorcycle Workers' Union, and related organizations, are planning to hold meetings to welcome the enthusiastic return of overseas Chinese from various places to serve the country. However, they do not yet know the arrival dates of the corps, so the holding of the welcome meeting will have to wait until the corps arrive in Hong Kong before it can be decided.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the National Cartoonists Association, it has been actively promoting cartoon work in various places. Branches in Sichuan, Xi'an, Guilin, and South China have been established successively. However, since the fall of Guangzhou, the work of the South China Branch has been suspended. Yesterday, Ye Qianyu from the headquarters arrived in Hong Kong from Guilin and immediately convened cartoon workers in Hong Kong to set up the Hong Kong Branch.

Therefore, he was entrusted to come to Hong Kong to promote the meeting with the comrades in Hong Kong. As a result, everyone expressed their approval, so the inaugural meeting was convened. Ye then elaborated on the significance of establishing the Cartoonists Association: (1) Cartoonists occupy an important position in the War of Resistance and should take unified steps to jointly pursue the War of Resistance and nation-building, and expand foreign propaganda work; (2) In order to improve the level of Chinese cartoons, we should contact each other and learn from each other.</p>
<p>Huang Ding Proposes Improving Serial Comics</p>
<p>After Ye delivered his speech, celebrities delivered speeches one after another, elaborating on the mission before the cartoonists. Huang Ding proposed launching a movement to improve serial comics in order to achieve propaganda effects. The public expressed approval and passed it. After discussing future work, Ye Qianyu proposed holding a large-scale "Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition" in Hong Kong in the near future, in order to arouse public interest and understanding of cartoons.

<h3>People's Palace Postponed Opening, Still Accepting Applications</h3>
<p>The People's Palace, organized by the Refugee Relief Association, was originally scheduled to open today. However, the ditches in the house are not yet perfect, and there are too many refugees seeking accommodation, so strict inspections are required. Those who are not genuine refugees will not be accepted. Therefore, the review has not yet been completed, and the opening has been postponed to the 19th. The review committee held another meeting yesterday afternoon to review the qualifications of refugees. According to the person in charge of the association, although there are many people seeking accommodation, they will continue to accept applications for residence before the opening.</p>
<h3>A Giant in China's Pharmaceutical Industry, the Hong Kong Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory Opens Today, A New Factory in Kowloon City Hosts Guests from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>(Special Report) Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, a giant in China's pharmaceutical industry, has been established for more than ten years. Due to its grand scale and outstanding reputation, its operations are thriving. Recently, because Hong Kong is the center of transportation in East Asia, commerce is developed, and the population is dense, it is regrettable that there is a lack of a Chinese pharmaceutical factory that is most closely related to the health of residents. Therefore, it was decided to gather overseas Chinese in Hong Kong to organize Sun-Ya Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and build a factory at 183 Kowloon City Road, with a business department at 16 Avenue Central. The new factory was completed today. The company's directors, including Mr. Xu Guanqun, have specially invited people from all walks of life to attend the ceremony, and will hold a tea party to entertain them at 1 pm. At that time, Kowloon City Road will be full of traffic, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>

At that time, Huo and a dozen co-residents were inside. Huo saw the robbers swarming in and asked loudly. The robbers threatened with weapons and forbade them to speak. Huo stepped forward and entangled with the robbers, which angered the robbers, and Huo was chopped in the head with a kitchen knife. After Huo was chopped, he was covered in blood and was afraid of being killed, so he dared not resist.</p>
<p>Emptying Boxes and Bags, Searching Separately. At that time, the people in the house did not dare to move because the robbers were fierce. The robbers then tied everyone up with ropes, and then emptied the boxes and bags and searched separately. After about half an hour, they escaped with the stolen goods. After the robbers left, the people in the house sounded the alarm. The police rushed to the scene after hearing the news, and reported to the police station, and sent Huo to Jiu Long Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Carrying a Military Knife Leaving the Camp, Chinese Laborers Sentenced to Imprisonment, Three People Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Huang Tian, 22 years old, Guo Zhong, 23 years old, and Lu Jinbao, 25 years old, three Chinese engineering soldiers of the British Army, were sentenced to three months in prison each by the magistrate Fu of the Central Police Station yesterday morning for possessing sharp weapons and plotting illegal actions. During the court hearing, all three defendants pleaded not guilty, claiming that although they had violated the military camp regulations by carrying sharp weapons, it was entirely for self-defense. The judge then ordered the officer of the British Army camp, Mr. Hua Xishi, to testify, saying that the British Army had issued an order on March 3 to prevent this group of Chinese engineering soldiers from fighting and causing trouble outside, and that all Chinese engineering soldiers, whether in plain clothes or military uniforms, were not allowed to carry sharp weapons. In addition to the English woman, the announcement also included Chinese characters. Then the assistant inspector of the detectives, Mr. Bi Jia, testified. After listening, the judge convicted each defendant. At this time, Mr. De Jian told the judge that he was obeying the order of his superior and asked the court to pay attention to this case, because the defendant seemed to want to have a big fight with other vendors or coolies at that time. Assistant Inspector Bi Jia told Si that the Chinese engineering soldiers often had disputes with vendors or coolies recently, which affected the security of the residents. Therefore, the police authorities recently informed the British Army headquarters and asked them to order the Chinese engineering soldiers to be prohibited from carrying sharp weapons. The judge also believed that this case was serious and could not be punished more severely, so he sentenced each defendant to three months in prison.</p>
<h3>Stabbed in the Toilet, Sailor Tan Sheng Died Yesterday Morning, The Police Bought an Errant Boy and Will Charge Him with Murder</h3>
<p>The man, Tan Sheng, 45 years old, lived on the fourth floor of 3 Shandong Street, Mong Kok, and was employed as a chef on the Taikoo Steamship Company's "Blue Smoke" Ship No. 3. Later, due to the Lunar New Year, he asked for leave to stay in Hong Kong for the New Year. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 in the morning on March 7, when he went to the public toilet on Canton Road, Mong Kok, a man suddenly used an axe to chop him four times in the head. The murderer fled without a trace after committing the crime. After Tan Sheng was injured, he fainted in a pool of blood. Later, the person in charge of the toilet found out and reported to the police to the scene, and telegraphed the Mong Kok Police Station. The officer on duty immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to the toilet to investigate, but the murderer had fled far away and was not caught. Then he immediately called a Red Cross ambulance to the scene and sent the injured person to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The police considered this case to be a stabbing case and tried their best to hunt down the murderer, and solicited witnesses to come to the police station to report the situation at the time of the incident. Unexpectedly, the injured person died in the hospital at 1:05 yesterday morning due to serious injuries after the doctor's treatment was ineffective. The police changed the case to a murder case after receiving the news, and offered a reward of fifty yuan to arrest the murderer and deal with it severely.</p>
<h3>Morale Gradually Dwindling, the Relief Association Actually Adjourned Yesterday, Only 13 Groups of Representatives Attended</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong All-Circles Joint Relief Association for South China Refugees is the general group of charitable organizations in Hong Kong. In the past, the work achievements were quite satisfactory. The association holds meetings every week, and the number of attendees reaches 30 to 40 people, which is very enthusiastic. However, since the Japanese army re-committed Shenzhen, the work of the Unified Refugee Camp run by the association in Shenzhen was forced to stop, and the association's work was declining. In recent meetings, the number of people has gradually decreased. The 39th Joint Meeting, originally scheduled to be held at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 yesterday afternoon, was adjourned because there were only 15 representatives from 13 groups present, which is a pity. As for the agenda listed by the association yesterday, although there were not many, three groups appealed to the association to assist in serving the refugees. In addition, there was a slightly more important case, which was the disposal of the remaining accounts of the Shenzhen Refugee Camp proposed by the relief team. Although this case was not discussed due to the adjournment yesterday, it is reported that the association has a lot of relief supplies in stock, and there are also 600 bags of rice. Therefore, the reporter asked the attendees for their opinions on this matter. Most of them thought that the recent rice shortage in the mainland was serious, and they planned to request that the rice be transported to the mainland to hold a price, and at the same time, they were deeply afraid that the joint relief association would disintegrate due to the seemingly different attitudes of the members. It is also heard that the next meeting of the association will reduce the number of statutory attendees by a lamp.</p>

<p>[Special Report] The Yau Ma Tei Neighborhood, jointly organized by the Hui Yang Youth Association, has decided to open a one-yuan debt repayment flea market carnival at the Ping On Theatre in Yau Ma Tei at 9:30 am on the 26th of this month.

The An Le Soda Company has been rewarded with soda for the entire venue, the Nanyang Smoked Herb Company has been rewarded with cigarettes, and the Xing De Duo Sugar Fruit Public Report has been rewarded with sugar fruit. Mr. Du Qizhang has been rewarded with calligraphy and painting. Because this event is for the country, I think the overseas Chinese will definitely have enthusiastic help for this association.</p>
<p>Vigor is the road to life, decadence is the road to death National Spiritual Mobilization, Qi Zhuo, Various Schools Have Formulated Specific Conventions for Practice</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Vigor is the road to life, decadence is the road to death National Spiritual Mobilization, Various Schools Have Formulated Specific Conventions for Practice</h3>
<p>Since the war began and the fires of war have risen, we are immensely gratified by the phenomena of hard work, seriousness, and progress. However, to this day, there are still dark shadows of decadence, licentiousness, and corruption, which truly sadden us!</p>
<p>In response to the needs of the nation at the present stage, Chairman Chiang recently formulated the "General Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization," which was submitted to the Fifth Plenary Session and the Third National Political Council for approval, and was recently telegraphed to the whole country for implementation. The full text has also been published in various newspapers. This is the most noteworthy and exciting major event of the past few days.</p>
<p>Enlightened people residing in Hong Kong are even more excited about this, because we live overseas, and our lives are already extremely superior compared to our compatriots in China, and even more wasteful and decadent than overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia. This not only fails to live up to the nation, but also affects international perceptions. Therefore, various schools in Hong Kong have decided to respond to the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement in order to revitalize the spirit of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, so that everyone can be aware and the atmosphere can be changed. In the midst of excitement, the reporter went to various schools yesterday to inquire about the details, in order to report to the readers.</p>
<p>The methods of Zhi Yong Middle School, which has nearly a thousand students and is full of vitality, are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The spiritual mobilization committee is organized by the school's instructors to implement the spiritual mobilization work:</p>
<p>2. The first oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for the 20th of this month. All staff and students will take a general oath once a week;</p>
<p>3. A joint guarantee method is adopted. Under each instructor, every ten people form a group, and each group supervises each other, and each group also supervises each other. The principle of the same group is to live close to each other;</p>
<p>4. Every week, the instructor convenes all or part of the students under their leadership to give a spiritual speech;</p>
<p>5. Each staff member and student must first promote to the family and then to relatives and friends the need for spiritual mobilization and the observance of national covenants, and gather all staff and students to publish publications to carry out general publicity in the society;</p>
<p>6. If you violate the oath, the students in the same group will be punished with joint responsibility if they do not report it. Those in the same group who swear far away will also be given appropriate punishment. Those who can fulfill the oath and have excellent results will be rewarded;</p>
<p>7. The Spiritual Mobilization Committee meets once a week to review the work of the week, discuss the issue of rewards and punishments, and promote the work of the entire committee.</p>
<p>After obtaining the fresh methods of Zhi Yong Middle School that had just emerged from the meeting, I immediately ran to the China Amateur School. From their past style of running the school, it can be predicted that they will not lag behind in this matter. Sure enough, the following is a good way for amateur schools to implement spiritual mobilization:</p>
<p>"Time" At 8:10 pm on Monday, March 20, 1939, the oath-taking ceremony will be held in the school auditorium to begin implementation.</p>
<p>"Common Goals" (1) The nation is supreme, and the nation is supreme! (2) Military affairs are first, and victory is first! (3) Concentrate your will and concentrate your strength!</p>
<p>"Implementation Methods" (1) Get up early: Get up at 6 o'clock! (2) Be on time: Be one minute early for class and assembly! (3) Fitness: Participate in manual labor, clean the indoors and outdoors, exercise, and travel on Sundays! (4) Responsibility: Be brave and forward in case of trouble, persevere to the end, and never retreat halfway! (5) Study: You must read newspapers, new paintings, and magazines every day, pursue and study the knowledge and new skills necessary for the times, and strive to serve the times! (6) Economy: Do not smoke, do not drink alcohol, do not gamble, do not wear lipstick, do not wear high-heeled leather shoes, do not wear gold and silver head masters, ××××××, donate the money saved to the country!</p>
<p>"Spiritual Speech" Every Monday, a spiritual speech is held to boost the spirit of the whole body.</p>
<p>In a happy mood after receiving the harvest, I drove again to the South China Middle School, which has 1,300 students and is well-managed.</p>
<p>Regarding the response to the National Spiritual Mobilization, the school first decided on four such thick rules:</p>
<p>1. The original "special course" will be given spiritual mobilization materials, in order to deepen it;</p>
<p>2. Teachers and students hold individual talks, in order to target the personality of each student, so that they can thoroughly realize and move forward vigorously;</p>
<p>3. The student union and class association wallpapers publish special editions of spiritual mobilization, in order to discuss and abide by them together;</p>
<p>4. Take "National Spiritual Mobilization" as the central work of moral education in the whole school at present.</p>
<p>As for the specific methods, the school is scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon.</p>
<p>When I continued to visit Guangda Affiliated Middle School, Overseas Chinese Middle School, Zhenguang Girls' Middle School, etc., they had all dismissed from school. The schools led by Mr. Zhang Lanzhou, Li Daren, and Xie Feilie also decided to respond unanimously. The Hong Kong Yuan Education Federation also held a meeting last night and unanimously passed a letter to all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, requesting them to implement the "General Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization" in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will also implement spiritual mobilization, which makes us even more excited, because the merchants and overseas Chinese owned by the association are a large number. If it is done well, the impact will be very large. However, in view of the coldness of past donations and the recent achievements of the New Year's flower market economy movement, we sincerely hope that the advanced members of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the merchants and overseas Chinese will be cautious about this move and strive to promote it!</p>
<h3>Jinshan Ship Sailed to Guangzhou Yesterday Morning with 40 Passengers, 18 Chinese</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of navigation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, after the Hong Kong government consulted with the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, the Jinshan Ship of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Shipping Company was ordered to sail to Guangzhou for the third time at 9:00 yesterday morning. Therefore, the ship returned to Hong Kong from Macau at 7:00 yesterday morning. After the passengers disembarked, they hurriedly cleaned up a little, and set off for Guangzhou at 9:00. Therefore, the ship only carried dozens of bags of flour and several boxes of furniture this time. There were 40 passengers in total, 18 of whom were Chinese and the rest were Westerners. The ship arrived in Guangzhou yesterday and docked at Shamian. It will depart for Hong Kong at 9:00 on the 16th and return to Hong Kong and Macau the next day (17th) at 5:30 pm.</p>
<h3>Air Transport Becomes More Convenient: Hong Kong-Vietnam-Yunnan-Chongqing Joint Transportation Realized; Imperial Airways Has Obtained the Right to Establish a Station in Hanoi; Myanmar-Chongqing Line Trial Flight Completed, Scheduled to Open at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>In recent years, the development of the Far East aviation industry has progressed rapidly. Air routes in various countries are actively expanding. Recently, the Chinese and British governments reached an agreement to open up air routes to Myanmar and Chongqing. This route has already completed its trial flight and is scheduled to officially open at the end of the month. According to reporters, the Hong Kong-Vietnam line jointly operated by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Imperial Airways will also begin its trial flight soon. The plan for British Imperial Airways to establish a station in Hanoi has been realized. According to the company's announcement yesterday morning, it has obtained approval from the French Vietnamese authorities. This franchise is the result of numerous contacts between the company and the Vietnamese authorities. Hereafter, British Imperial Airways aircraft can fly to Hanoi to pick up passengers, mail, and cargo. The most important effect of the realization of this plan is that passengers from Hong Kong to inland China can now take British Imperial Airways aircraft from Hong Kong to Hanoi, transfer to CNAC or Eurasia Aviation Corporation aircraft to Kunming, Chongqing, and other inland locations. The Vietnamese authorities have granted British Imperial Airways commercial rights, but only limited the sale of joint transportation tickets. According to CNAC sources, the Myanmar-Chongqing line, which is being prepared, has undergone numerous trial flights with satisfactory results. However, due to the small area of the Lashio Airport in Myanmar after testing, there are concerns about the safety of aircraft landing there. Reconstruction is currently underway, so the opening date of the Myanmar-Chongqing route must be postponed to the end of this month. Both Imperial Airways and CNAC have dispatched aircraft to test this route, and the process has been exceptionally smooth. It is expected that the business prospects of this important international route will be promising.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong and Kowloon Teachers' Association Resolved Yesterday to Enlarge the Celebration of the April 4th Children's Day; A Flag Presentation and Donation Ceremony Will Be Held Indoors; and the Implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Law Will Be Promoted</h3>

Attendees included Chen Tieyi (Chairman), Wang Shutao, Zhang Lanzhou, Huang Yanqing, Li Daren, and others. During the meeting, discussions were held regarding the expansion of the celebration of Children's Day this year, the holding of a flag presentation and donation ceremony, the handling of children's education, and the issuance of circulars to all schools to follow Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's announcement to implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Implementation Measures. The meeting adjourned at around 10:00 PM. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) The list of donors from the National Salvation Public Bonds Committee will be distributed to member schools by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Associations. (2) The One Dollar Debt Repayment Campaign will continue to urge schools to make supplementary payments, no later than April 1st, to be deposited in the bank.

(4) In response to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's announcement of the National Spiritual Mobilization, it was resolved to send letters to all schools to follow Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's announcement to implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Implementation Measures, and to promote them earnestly.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong News in Brief</h3>
<p>...The Rotary Club held a luncheon yesterday afternoon at the Hong Kong Hotel, featuring a speech by our former ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, entitled "One Wheel, One Revolution." He elucidated from a historical perspective why China, with its sublime culture and bright history, has weakened, and the future prospects of its evolution, which was very concise and moving to the listeners.</p>
<p>...The local guides industry, in order to promote its own health and to bring unscrupulous individuals into the right track, intends to establish an industry association. On the afternoon of the 13th, a meeting of the industry was convened at the Chung Sing Charitable Society. Details were reported in yesterday's newspapers. However, the persons in charge of the Chung Sing Charitable Society stated that before the meeting, Xie Feilie had requested to borrow the venue for a meeting in the name of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief, but during the meeting, those present were all local guides, and the discussion was about the association's articles of association, which was different from the name of the letter requesting the venue. Some members criticized this after the fact. Therefore, the persons in charge of the society have scheduled a meeting tonight at 8:00 PM to report on the matter and discuss all related issues.</p>
<h3>Shenzhen Rural Relief Association Leads Villagers to Promote Credit Cooperatives; Youth Training Classes Continue; Establishment of Many Schools to Benefit Village Children</h3>
<p>On Wednesday of last week, the Shenzhen Rural Relief Association led about 70 villagers from Caiwuwei Village to convene a preparatory meeting for the Credit Cooperative. The Relief Association has now dispatched responsible personnel to assist in everything. To promote relief work, offices have been established in Luohu, Caiwuwei, and other villages. Youth training classes continue, with the number of students increasing from 15 to 25. Consideration is currently being given to establishing multiple schools in other villages near Shenzhen so that children who cannot afford to attend schools in Luohu, Shatoujiao, and other places have the opportunity to attend school. Under the guidance of Professor Lin Lichazhao, the agricultural team has begun work in Caiwuwei Village. There are currently three permanent staff members. Irrigation work has also begun, with the largest dam under construction. Mr. Cole James, who is in charge of agricultural work, has expressed that the work there is very successful.</p>

<h3>East River × Plotting Restlessly; Our Army Advances Towards Zengcheng</h3>
<p>Surprise Attack on the Prince Pit × Camp Achieves Victory; Fierce Battle at Xiancun, × Suffers Heavy Losses Again</p>
<p>[East River Express] The invading × troops in Guangdong have been frequently mobilizing in recent weeks. The strength of the × forces on the East, West, and North River lines has changed compared to before. According to recent reports received by military agencies, the main force of the × troops is concentrated between Zengcheng and Conghua, and there is indeed an attempt to detour north. As for the remaining × forces on various points and lines, although there have been occasional disturbances and reinforcements, they are all a kind of bluff. Currently, due to the strength of the × forces on the East and West Rivers, they are temporarily adopting a defensive posture. Our army is closely monitoring the × forces in Zengcong and attacking the × forces. The following is a record of the battle situation on the East River:</p>
<p>Our Army in Zhengguo Attacks the × Forces</p>
<p>It has been verified that our armies in Longmen, Boluo, and Conghua have long formed a strong formation, closely controlling the × forces in Zengcong. It has been verified that our army, the Huang Division of a certain army group, which is stationed in the front line area at the foot of Luofu Mountain, has repeatedly engaged in outposts with the × army after advancing towards Zengcheng. On the 10th, a Huang Shuai detachment of our army advanced towards the Taizikeng Huangshishang × formation in the Zhengguo area, engaging in fierce battles with the ×, resulting in dozens of × being killed and a large number of war trophies obtained. After the × suffered heavy losses, they bribed villagers to infiltrate our positions to scout out our strength, but our defenses were tight, and the × plot failed. Currently, our army in the Zhengguo Paitan area has adopted close communications, preparing to launch a major offensive against the × in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle at Xiancun, × Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>In addition, the guerrillas in the third and fourth districts were ordered to penetrate deep into the × formation and carry out guerrilla annihilation battles. Various teams have penetrated deep into the × army's base areas and have repeatedly achieved results. It has been verified that the Dongguan First Brigade Yin Zhongming, the Liang Geng and Shen Shui companies under its command, have been active in the Longhuang Highway (the Huangyong to Shilong Highway under Dongguan) area for several days. On the 9th, more than 200 members of the team suddenly attacked the Xiancun × camp, using machine guns and grenades to shoot and throw at the ×. The × were alerted and met the attack, leading to fierce fighting. Both sides fought fiercely for about an hour, with casualties on both sides. Our team was forced to retreat due to the ×'s numerical superiority. It is estimated that the × suffered more than 50 casualties, and more than 20 mules and horses were also killed. Our side suffered more than 30 casualties. The intensity of the battle was the most seen in the East River guerrilla raids on the × in recent days.</p>
<h3>× Land and Sea Attacks, Daliang Falls Again; Fierce Battle for Four Hours, County Government Team Retreats to Rongqi; First District First Task Force Immediately Reinforces</h3>
<p>[Rongqi Express] Daliang, the county seat of Shunde County, was once captured by the ×, causing great suffering. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, the × again dispatched a large force from Dazhou and Shihuxu to attack. On the afternoon of that day, Daliang fell again. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shooting Traitors, × Army Sets Fire</p>
<p>The Dazhou Township Pseudo-Maintenance Committee, which is close to Daliang, was established long ago under the support of the ×. The pseudo-committee members, such as Mo Qi, acted as bullies and harmed the township. On the 11th of this month, our guerrilla team sent a team to sneak into Dazhou to carry out an anti-traitor campaign. Liao and two pseudo-committee members were shot dead, and other accomplices fled. They reported to the × army. That night, more than 200 × soldiers arrived in Dazhou, claiming to search for guerrillas, but found nothing. They were angry and set fire to three locations, which burned fiercely. More than 20 shops in the township were destroyed, families were ruined, and the number of people who were brutally killed has not yet been counted.</p>
<p>Land and Sea Advance, Capturing Daliang</p>
<p>On the next day (12th), the × again mobilized 200 soldiers, accompanied by many small steel cannons, and advanced to Shihuxu. In the morning, they set out from Dazhou and Shihuxu in two routes, land and sea, towards Daliang. The × of Dazhou drove rubber dinghies, and the × of Shihuxu went by land. At 12:00, the two routes arrived near Daliang at the same time, and immediately used small cannons and machine guns to sweep intensively. Lu Ling, the deputy commander of the First Column of the First District of our Guerrilla, and Su Liping, the magistrate of Shunde County, commanded the teams and police teams to resist separately. The sound of gunfire was deafening, the cries of women and children in the city shook the world, and the residents were extremely embarrassed. After fighting fiercely until 4:00 PM, our team gradually retreated due to the disparity in numbers and firepower. The × army then captured Daliang.</p>
<p>Retreat to Rongqi, Yuan Leads Reinforcements</p>
<p>During the fierce battle, the deputy commander immediately sent telegrams to teams in various places for reinforcements. Due to the short time, the reinforcements could not hold. The Rongqi County Government also followed the magistrate to retreat to that area. The × army still wanted to advance, but fortunately, Yuan Dai's troops of the First Task Force of the First District heard the alarm and rushed to the aid from Xiaolan and assisted in the defense of Rongqi. The × did not dare to advance again. At present, the guerrilla teams of the First and Third Districts are gathering separately, aiming to attack the × people in the shortest possible time and regain Daliang. According to the people who escaped from Daliang, the × looted and plundered even more than before. Those who failed to escape suffered unspeakable harm.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Suburbs, Strong Men Repeatedly Brutally Killed; More Than 100 Killed in Yaotou Township Recently</h3>
<p>[Panyu Express] After most of the × troops near Guangzhou and Foshan were transferred, the defenses were extremely empty, so they have been repeatedly attacked by our guerrilla teams in the past ten days, making it difficult for the × to cope. At present, the × are in a state of panic, and everyone is a soldier. Therefore, in recent times, they have been extremely attentive to the strong men in our villages, and they are killed if there is any suspicion. It has been verified that the guerrilla teams in Yaotou, Geshan, Zhuangtou, Ruibao, and other townships in the southern suburbs of Guangzhou secretly lurked near Yaotou on the 6th of this month and killed more than 20 × transport soldiers. The × army then identified Yaotou Township as the base of our guerrilla team, so at about 4:00 PM that afternoon, they dispatched more than 300 × soldiers to surround Yaotou. When they entered, they searched. Whenever they encountered a strong man, they killed him. Even middle-aged women were identified as female shooters and guerrillas, and they were killed immediately. They also burned down seven or eight civilian houses. It has been verified that more than 100 men and women were brutally killed by the × in this township.</p>
<h3>Shenzhen Rumors Flare Up Again; Residents Move into British Territory at Night; County Government Officials Disperse, Residents Misunderstand; Traitors Take the Opportunity to Incite, Unnecessary Trouble</h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Express] After Shenzhen suffered a tragic × air raid last month, with more than 100 houses destroyed and more than 100 civilians killed or injured, the residents were almost completely evacuated after this unprecedented disaster. Fortunately, the Shenzhen Police Department tried its best to maintain law and order, so the market order has gradually recovered recently. The merchants and people who had to enter the British territory of Sheung Shui and Fanling have gradually returned to the market to live and do business, and most of the farmers have also returned to prepare for spring plowing. However, for some reason last (13th) night, many rumors suddenly occurred, and it was reported that the × army had intentions towards Bao'an, causing panic for a time. Many people moved into British territory at night, and even on the morning of the 14th, many people continued to transport coffins and other items.</p>
<p>Officials Disperse, Traitors Spread Rumors</p>
<p>I have learned from various sources that the occurrence of this rumor was due to the fact that a part of the Bao'an County Government officials were ordered to disperse. These officials moved out of the county government on the evening of the 13th. When the residents saw this, they thought that an accident was about to happen, and the rumors were also spread by some traitors, some of whom claimed that the × aircraft would bomb again on the morning of the 14th, while others said that the × army had an attempt to attack Shenzhen last (14th) morning, causing the general public to flee in panic like startled birds.</p>
<p>Police Admonish, Strictly Guard Against Traitors</p>
<p>The Shenzhen Police Department, in order to avoid panic among merchants and people, specially dispatched patrol officers and many police officers to patrol the market last night to prevent the activities of petty thieves and traitors. On the one hand, they also admonished merchants and people not to be deceived by rumors of traitors, and suffer the consequences. As for the former Director Zeng of the Police Department, he had gone to Hong Kong on official business to meet with the Police Commissioner. After receiving this news, he immediately took a car back to Shenzhen yesterday morning to suppress the situation. The County Government also dispatched a large number of police teams to conduct strict inspections of pedestrians at various strategic road junctions to prevent traitors from mingling.</p>

<h3>× Army's Restlessness Exists; Fall of Jiangmen Unconfirmed; Few Air Raids Recently; Market Prosperity Has Also Recovered</h3>
<p>[Jiangmen News] Yesterday, the local market was rumored to have fallen. The reporter investigated various aspects and found it to be untrue. Since Jiangmen was bombed by the × aircraft a month ago, there have been few air raids in Jiangmen recently, and the prosperity of the market has gradually recovered. However, at 5:00 AM yesterday (12th) morning, before dawn, Jiangmen issued an air raid alarm, and the public was awakened from their dreams. Before long, they heard the sound of planes rattling and flew east. At about 5:00 PM that afternoon, the alarm sounded again. However, at the time, there was light rain and the sky was dim. The × aircraft flew very high, crossed the sky over Jiangmen, and flew south. When the × aircraft was far away, the alarm was lifted.</p>

<h3>Several Famous Actresses' Unknown Husbands</h3>
<p>— Text</p>
<p>Recently, a famous banker came to Hollywood. He was not very familiar with the film industry and asked a friend to introduce him to famous movie stars.</p>
<p>"Well, do you want to meet Claudette Pleasman, Chin Loth, Fotini Loping, Elin Griffen, Marte Lane Estherley, Martha Louise, and Margaret Hayward?" This friend asked him.</p>
<p>"I've never heard of them," he said. "Who wants to see those extras? I want to see some real big stars."</p>
<p>Were the people that friend mentioned really nobodies? The banker's reply dismissed a great opportunity to meet Claudette Colbert, Jean Arthur, Fotini Bruss, Irene Dunne, Marlene Dietrich, Martha Raye, and Margaret Sullavan. The names the friend said all had a husband's surname added to them, and these husbands are hardly known in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But many of them have one thing in common: a hatred of publicity. Take Claudette Colbert's husband, Dr. Zo Pleasman, for example. When Claudette married her ex-husband, Norman Foster, the marriage was often talked about. Everything written about Claudette always mentioned Norman Foster's name because he was a film actor and publicity was very beneficial to his career. But this time it's different. After marrying Pleasman, Claudette completely changed her style. When interviewed, she never talked about her private life or mentioned her husband's name. This was all done according to her husband's wishes, because Dr. Pleasman believes that it is a great shame to make a name for oneself as the husband of a movie star. When they were newly married, he even refused to have photos taken with Claudette, but later, after she explained that every actress's husband did this, and that refusing would cause resentment from the photographers, he no longer insisted on his own way. Friends close to her say that people in Hollywood think that Claudette's job is more arduous than her husband's. Claudette thinks this is wrong. According to her, his job is much more arduous. As long as we know what her husband does, we can probably agree with her.</p>
<p>Dr. Pleasman is a graduate of Harvard Medical School and was an intern at the famous Bella Hospital in New York. He now works in two important hospitals in Los Angeles and has ample experience. In his spare time, he often conducts medical research, which may even refresh the history of medicine. However, what the world knows about him is only that "He is Claudette Colbert's husband." How annoying is that?</p>
<p>He is a handsome man, now 36 years old, with a stately six-foot figure. In every way, he is enough to attract the attention of the opposite sex. Claudette first saw him in his office. She was seeing a doctor, and he seemed to ignore the arrival of such a big star. Perhaps it was this that particularly aroused Claudette's interest. However, she had no feeling of falling in love with her doctor at that time. It wasn't until she met him by chance on the golf course and talked for a while that Claudette realized what an interesting person he was outside the office. They got married in Yuma in December 1935.</p>
<p>Ren Hayward also feels the same as Pleasman. Although he is one of the country's top lawyers, in public, he is just "Mr. Margaret Sullavan." What's worse is that his name is often confused with Lewis Hayward, who is also the husband of movie star Ida Lupino.</p>
<p>When people in the film industry mention his name, they are always accompanied by a sense of respect or jealousy. True, he often gives those filmmakers a headache, but he is also the legal representative of many film stars—Marlene Hawkins, Fleur Stan, Chin Chou Luo Giller.</p>
<p>Because his methods are so clever and interesting, there are many anecdotes with him as the central figure. The most interesting of these is about his selling a script. He used high-pressure tactics to force a filmmaker to pay $50,000 for a script. The deal was done, and he made a phone call to the writer. "Hey, listen, I've already sold a script for you. You'd better write it quickly." How can they not have a headache when they buy a script for $50,000 that hasn't even been started?</p>
<p>Ren comes from a noble family. His father was Colonel Bill Hayward. He also received higher education and earned a degree at Princeton. He often accompanied women, so before marrying Margaret Sullavan, there was a belief that he would marry Katherine Hepburn.</p>
<p>It started like this: Margaret Sullavan went to his office as a party to an event. It was love at first sight. He fell madly in love with her. Now they are one of the happiest couples in Hollywood. Friends say that only he can tame Margaret Sullavan's wildness.</p>
<p>Jean Arthur rarely talks about her unknown husband, Frank Ross, to outsiders, but recently Frank often talks about her.</p>
<p>Frank is an assistant producer in the production department of Harold Studios, a dark-skinned, slender man with a very good appearance. He has had many opportunities to appear on the screen, but he has refused. He feels that it is better to leave the acting to Jean Arthur.</p>
<p>When he first met Jean Arthur, he was running a real estate business and came to California for a trip. He was also a student at Princeton, and the friends he came into contact with on a daily basis were all wealthy and conservative people from noble families. When he arrived in Hollywood, everything was new and exciting, which made him happy. When he met Jean, he felt that she was exactly the person in his mind. Others say she is proud, but he thinks that it is just a manifestation of her shyness. Jean has a bit of an "inferiority complex", and Frank has been working hard to help her get rid of it after they became friends. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Dionne Quintuplets to go to Toronto for an Audience with the British Monarch</h3>
<p>[Reuters Ottawa, 13th] The world-famous father of the Canadian quintuplets, Oliva Dionne, has accepted a government invitation to move his five daughters to Toronto so that they may be seen by the British King and Queen during their visit to Canada. The audience is scheduled to take place on March 22nd at the Legislative Assembly Building.</p>
<h3>Honeysuckle</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Roedeer Hercheson, has as many boyfriends as collecting old stamps, and sometimes passes boyfriends on to others like sending stamps. But this newly acquired precious stamp! Hall Thompson—probably won't be passed on. Originally, her three-part boyfriend-collecting symphony was "liking," "loving," and "discarding" in three stages. This time, the third part can be skipped. Not only that, but even if her mother opposes this union, she would rather leave her family than give up Hall.</p>
<p>King George and Queen Mary of England are about to visit America. A group of English stars in Hollywood are very excited. Among them, notable figures like Colman, Leibling, Madalyn Carroll, and Ida Lupino will jointly send a letter to the King and Queen, expressing their strong hope that the King and Queen can visit Hollywood during their visit to America. This letter will be signed by all British actors in the film city. In addition, Madalyn Carroll also sent a special cable to a prominent figure she knows, asking him to urge the King and Queen to come. If this can become a reality, Hollywood should really thank them.</p>

<h3>A Tour of New Tamsui</h3>
<p>— Furan</p>
<p>From the recovery of Tamsui to the Provisional Administrative Committee</p>
<p>(1) The Enemy Rolled Away</p>
<p>On November 7th, the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth waved over every prominent location in Tamsui, as if shouting, "Come back, compatriots of Tamsui, the ×eight have rolled away."</p>
<p>Why did the × people have to roll away? The active role of the Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force in their vigilance relentlessly punished the treacherous villains who harmed the country and the people. The armed solidarity of young people, workers, and peasants in various places grew stronger day by day—the greatest threat. The × people deeply felt their own weakness in military strength, feared death, and feared complete annihilation, so they had to drag their pathetic tails and roll away.</p>
<p>(2) Convening a Mass Meeting</p>
<p>Tamsui, which had been devastated to the point of near death and utter ruin, convened a mass meeting on November 12th for the sake of social order and post-disaster issues. In addition to the youth engaged in salvation work and a small number of merchants and residents, the rest of those who attended were all farmers from various villages, numbering about four to five hundred people. In this meeting of great significance, new tasks for the future were proposed:</p>
<p>1. Establish a Provisional Administrative Committee as the local high-level political institution.</p>
<p>2. Broadly launch the mass salvation movement.</p>
<p>3. Abolish harsh taxes and improve the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>4. Mobilize the masses to intensify the anti-traitor movement.</p>
<p>(3) The Establishment of the Provisional Administrative Committee and the Appearance of New Figures</p>
<p>What is the driving force of this new institution? It is nine young fellows, nine leaders of the Tamsui salvation movement. They have always struggled with an indomitable spirit of attack. During the fall of Tamsui, they fought a desperate battle against the psychology of hiding in the nearby mountain villages and compromising, surrendering, and seeking temporary safety, and fear of the Japanese disease. To ignite the flames of resistance and organize guerrillas, they had to run at least fifty miles a day like fellows.</p>
<p>Now, in this chaotic state, how can they have strict and vigorous arrangements and strive to implement the resolutions of the mass meeting?</p>
<p>1. Establish a military department—responsible for mobilizing the local masses to intensify armed organization and participate in the great ranks of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>2. Establish an anti-traitor department—mobilize various townships and towns to intensify armed anti-traitor organizations and establish intelligence networks in various villages.</p>
<p>3. Education—run schools for children in distress and universally launch night schools in various townships and towns.</p>
<p>4. Administrative Department—abolish all harsh taxes, implement improvements in people's lives, prohibit the export of grain and the export or slaughter of ploughing cattle, and prohibit prostitution and gambling.</p>
<p>The existence of the Administrative Committee was only a short twenty days before the district office was to be restored. But even in just twenty days, social order gradually recovered, and the generally displaced Tamsui compatriots gradually returned to their hometowns.</p>
<p>From the Provisional Administrative Committee to the Restoration of the District Office</p>
<p>(1) The Restoration of the District Office and its New Administrative Plan</p>
<p>The Huiyang County Government expressed commendation for the young fellows of the Provisional Administrative Committee who were able to come out and shoulder the arduous task in this difficult and chaotic situation. In order to respect public opinion, it again had the district administration presided over by their nine committee members, designating one person from the nine as the district chief.</p>
<p>For the sake of the new Tamsui and the future of the entire district, they decided on an administrative plan and mobilized the people of the entire district to strive for its realization.</p>
<p>In terms of financial and economic planning—they will confiscate the property of traitors, abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, save on expenses, prohibit waste, severely punish corrupt village chiefs and local bullies, civil servants will not receive salaries, stipulate a minimum living allowance, protect and assist all industrial and commercial operations and development, crack down on any monopolies and manipulations by unscrupulous merchants: assist production and consumption cooperatives and restrict usury, and handle low-interest and interest-free loans.</p>
<p>In the plan to improve the people's livelihood—promulgate land laws and reduce rents in accordance with local conditions, protect farmers' permanent tenancy rights in accordance with the Tenant Farmer Protection Law, and handle water conservancy and disaster relief...</p>
<p>In the refugee relief plan—seek credit loans from overseas Chinese and wealthy merchants to help refugees, and delineate areas suitable for reclamation in the mountain areas and distribute them to refugees from the coastal areas.</p>
<p>In the internal affairs plan—implement measures to punish traitors and reward traitors for surrendering themselves, protect and assist all patriotic organizations and patriotic movements, universally organize mass armed forces, give preferential treatment to families of anti-Japanese soldiers, and give full play to the active role of the Baojia system...</p>
<p>In the education plan—implement free primary school education, establish various cultural groups, research societies, painting exhibitions, public libraries, book circulation and supply societies...</p>
<p>Moreover, they pointed out that in order to realize these plans, it is necessary to ensure that district administration is not divorced from salvation work, concentrate all those engaged in salvation work to strive for the realization of this plan, district office staff should increase their initiative and set a model, and establish a strict inspection and checking system.</p>
<p>We deeply believe that these people will definitely gain the support of the masses, because their plan is completely based on the interests of the people, and we are also convinced that they will definitely win, because their plan will gain the support of the people.</p>
<p>In fact, they are already in the midst of victory. They often receive material assistance from the masses, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, and even New Year cakes, peanuts, and sugarcane during the New Year... A salvation worker from Xinxu Township wrote, "Last night, many, many people were sighing that you (the district chief) only stayed in Xinxu for two or three hours and then left. I also apologized to them on your behalf, but their hearts are still concerned about you, as if you are the lover of their people."</p>

<h3>Today's Battle Between Two Chinese Teams at Happy Valley; Can Eastern Avenge Their Defeat? Guanghua is More Improved Than Before, So This Competition Will Be Fierce.</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] This year's football league has been contested for many months, but the championship issue for both the A and B groups remains a mystery, and it is still unknown who will win.</p>
<p>According to the schedule, the end of this month will be a satisfactory conclusion (the finals of other championship events will be held in April). Therefore, the General Association has scheduled the two matches of South China South vs. South China China and Eastern vs. Guanghua to be held this afternoon. However, South China requested to change the match to tomorrow (Thursday), which was approved by the General Association. Therefore, only the Hong Kong Stadium will have battles today.</p>
<p>This football match is quite important because Eastern still has hopes for the runner-up position. If Eastern can win today and then defeat the Navy on Saturday, the runner-up seat will not be difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>In the first round, Eastern was defeated by Guanghua. Both teams are more improved than before, so the issue of victory or defeat this time is quite thought-provoking. It is difficult to draw a conclusion until the end of the game. Let's see if Eastern can avenge their defeat.</p>
<p>The match will start at 5:15 pm. The host, Eastern, has specially revised the ticket prices, dividing them into two categories: 50 cents and 20 cents. Such affordable prices and a good show should attract many fans to come and watch. The two lineups are as follows (Taishui):</p>

Xie Qingfu, who is known as the "New Li Huitang," also set off with the telegram.

<h3>The Chinese Sports Association Held a Meeting Yesterday and Decided to Hold a Charity Match for the British Relief Fund. It Wants to Invite the Singapore China Team to Participate in the Charity Match, But It Will Be Decided After the Team Arrives in Hong Kong.</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Sports Advancement Association held a meeting in the Hua Yuan Conference Room at 5:30 pm yesterday. Among those present were Zhang Minquan, Chen Ziqing, Ye Guanyan, Mo Qing, Lin Shaohua, Shi Puhuan, Lin Zhonghao, Li Zijun, Zeng Jinghou, Zhou Runnian, Lu Xiafu (painter), and many others. Chairman Zhang Minquan, Mo Qing and Chen Ziqing successively reported on the process of the Governor's Cup competition, stating briefly that the Association's Chinese United team won two battles and two victories, and won the championship for two consecutive sessions. The two games earned a total of more than 4,300 yuan. After deducting expenses, it obtained more than 3,600 yuan. However, since this number must be divided equally with the Football Association, the actual amount obtained by the Association is about 1,300 yuan. The results are not weak. At the same time, the financial situation this year is also better than in previous years. After the report was completed, the following motions were discussed: [1] Publication of the annual report, [2] Date of the next election of staff members, [3] Whether there are any amendments to the constitution, [4] The British Relief China Branch requests to hold a charity football match, [5] Other matters.</p>
<p>[1] Regarding the issue of publishing the annual report, Chairman Zhang Minquan recounted the needs of the annual publication, and the public agreed and passed it. Zeng Jinghou was immediately elected as the director, and Li Zijun, Ye Guanyan, Lin Zhonghao, and Lin Shaohua were members of the group to handle the annual publication.</p>
<p>(2) The date of the next election of staff members was decided to be April 14 (Friday) in the Hua Yuan Conference Room.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the amendment to the constitution, the chairman suggested that it be reserved for the new staff members to discuss when they take over, and the public agreed and passed it.</p>
<p>(4) Chairman Zhang Minquan said that on the day of the Governor's Cup final, Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote came to present the awards. He requested the Association to hold a charity football match for the British Relief Fund. He personally felt that it was his duty and agreed to the request. It is now heard that the Singapore Chinese football team will come to Hong Kong at the end of this month. If they compete against the strong teams in Hong Kong and persuade the entrance tickets in advance, the results will be good. If the visiting team has funding problems, 20% can be allocated back, and the remaining 80% will be used as a charity. It is not impossible. Please ask Football Minister Mo Qingjun to handle it. According to Mo Qing, he had previously received a letter from the Singapore team saying that the team would only arrive in Hong Kong on the 26th or 27th of this month, and they would have to return to the south in early April. The time issue is a big consideration, and it is not easy to be sure whether the team will agree to this proposal. Yu believes that the best way to weave it is to wait for the team to come to Hong Kong and ask for their opinions before making a decision. As a result, it was resolved to hold a charity sale, with Mo... responsible for organizing the event.</p>
<p>(5) The Hua Lian team won the championship in this year's Cup, but the first starting team and the second starting team were very different. In order to commemorate the meritorious service of the first starting players, the Association decided to issue awards. The names of the winners are as follows: (1) ...Jun Gan, (2) Yang Shuiyi, (3) Hua Qingcai.</p>

<h3>Cyclist Zhou Shaowen to Arrive in Kunming</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Kunming, our newspaper, 14th] Youth cyclist Zhou Shaowen and Gu Zengyun, starting from Babu in Guangxi, via Liuzhou, Guiyang, Chongqing, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Road to Yunnan, will arrive in Kunming soon.</p>
<h3>Looking Back and Ahead</h3>
<p>— Lai Duanfu</p>
<p>South China's victory over Eastern was a good opportunity for South China to demonstrate its skills after the heavy rain, but it was a fatal blow to Eastern. The matter is now past, so let's not dwell on it. Now, let's talk about two points that people haven't discussed. First, both Eastern and South China are national armies. Why did some people set off firecrackers in the stands near the sea after Eastern's crushing defeat? If the firecrackers were not set off by Chinese people, then Westerners would have no reason to be happy about South China's victory. If they were Chinese, why would they express schadenfreude towards a national team? What kind of heart is inside the person who set off the firecrackers? Second, why did Liu Qingcai suddenly miss an important game? This is also something worth pondering.</p>
<p>"Chili Boy" Guo Qi changed his style to play as a forward and was surprisingly effective. According to his performance that day, he was even better than Liu Liancai. Xu Jingcheng, who is known for his courage, sometimes couldn't handle him, and Hou Chengxian was also jointly monitored by him and Mai Shaohan and couldn't do anything. For a while, the audience was surprised. In fact, this is not surprising, because Little Guo is also often a forward in small-scale games. He is familiar with it, so it is natural for him to be proficient. It's a pity that he is too short, otherwise he could have become a perfect forward.</p>
<p>If Eastern doesn't adjust Xu Jingcheng and reorganize the forward line, I dare not compliment them that they will improve in the future. If the forward line can get back a Zou Wenzhi-like inside forward, and Chen Bingtu practices cutting-in and shooting skills more, then Eastern cannot be underestimated. I am now thinking for them again and feel that Luo Weiquan is a right-sided player and should be an inside defender, just like his brother Wei Min. Although Zeng Zhongyun is good, he is still better as a defender. If they cannot get back a Zou Wenzhi-like player, I think they can change their lineup as shown in the table below, and I guarantee they will have a great harvest next season.</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Miao Huaguo Luo Weiquan</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng Song Lingsheng Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Cheng Tao Wu Qixiang Li Deqi Liu Shiqin Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>Eastern must be careful today when they play Guanghua. Guanghua also had a very good performance when they played South China. Since Eastern has shown a spirit of not giving way when playing South China, Guanghua naturally has the psychology of striving for the top at all costs. Guanghua's inside defense is strong on the right and weak on the left, but the forward line is weak on the right and strong on the left, which compensates for each other, so it is not weak. The forward line is more even than Eastern, and the high-speed offense is even more terrifying. With Eastern's forward line without Xu Jingcheng, it is still questionable whether they can withstand Guanghua's fearless forward line. I hope that Eastern will work hard and win another game to win the runner-up title.</p>
<p>Eastern's game against the Navy this Saturday is a great opportunity for them to win when the Navy is in decline. I hope they will work harder. If they can score one or two goals first, victory will be guaranteed. However, Liu Xianhan must be careful of the Navy's long-range shots. Don't be careless. The Navy's close-range shots are inaccurate. Although it is difficult to guarantee that Eastern's forward line will not be attacked by the heavy and aggressive Navy East for close-range shots, I am worried about Eastern because of this.</p>
<p>South China will play their first game at the Boundary Street pitch this Saturday and must be careful. At that time, I also hope that the police and civil servants will remember that they are colleagues and only show their skills and not rely on brute force, because although brothers are quarreling now, South China will still have to defend against the communists in the future and strive for the top.</p>
<p>Kitchee should try their best in the game against the 30th Artillery Battalion. After winning, they will compete with the Air Force team for the runner-up title. Work hard, the future is bright.</p>
<p>The England team lacks football players and has even recruited four players from the second division. The Great China team should win by a large margin, especially since Li Huitang has agreed to play because it is a charity match, so victory is even more guaranteed. The person who set off firecrackers after the Eastern vs. South China game, why not save those firecrackers and set them off on Sunday? It would be more meaningful.</p>

<h3>Confessions of a Smoker</h3>
<p>— Lv Ping</p>
<p>From the green velvet case of Three Castles cigarettes, I took out the last one, silently lit it, and shared one final kiss with it. The longing for a life of pleasure gradually disappeared into the light smoke, like cotton or mist. After more than ten years as companions, we parted ways in silence.</p>
<p>Indeed, cigarettes have been with me for more than ten years. According to general explanations, the benefits of smoking for people are that it can increase thinking and restore fatigue, while its drawbacks are that it stimulates nerves and damages the stomach. I love smoking, but not because it is beneficial to me. I am announcing a final farewell to it, not because I am afraid of the nicotine that is harmful to the body.</p>
<p>I met cigarettes in the social interactions of friends and fell in love with cigarettes in the enjoyment of life.</p>
<p>Recalling a life of wandering, in a life of indulgence, cigarettes were indeed my inseparable friend for a moment. When the lights were bright and the wine was green, it hung weakly on my drunken lips; in occasions of wild revelry, it helped my eloquent posture; when bored, watching the changing light smoke could pass half a day; when troubled, facing the flashing flames could make me forget everything. Just as the cigarette manufacturer's advertisement says: "They Satisfy," I smoked because I enjoyed life, and because I smoked, the enjoyment of life was even more satisfying.</p>
<p>I love cigarettes, but I have spent a lot of courage and perseverance on my passion for them. My wife was the first to object to my smoking, but I thought this was the effect of oxygen, and I didn't pay attention to her. My doctor determined that smoking was the main cause of my heart disease, and repeatedly advised me not to smoke, even comparing cigarettes to floods and fierce beasts, but I was not subdued by his intimidation. Within the principle of not considering the pros and cons, I lived sweetly with cigarettes for more than ten years.</p>
<p>I have always prided myself on being a confidant of cigarettes and also admitted that cigarettes are my lover. However, I finally shared one last kiss with it before saying goodbye forever.</p>
<p>Rather than saying that cigarettes are disappointed in me, it is better to say that I am disappointed in cigarettes, because I found that I did not really understand cigarettes and often insulted them.</p>
<p>When I found that there was only one cigarette left in my cigarette case, which was a symbolic sign that my spiritual food supply was almost empty, I reached into my pocket to take out a banknote to find a replenishment at a stall on the street. My fingers first touched a letter that M sent me, which suddenly reminded me of a passage in the letter.</p>
<p>"We traveled from ×× to ×× again on the 26th, walking for four days and four nights, and the mountain roads were very rugged, but all of us reached our destination without missing a single person. We were hungry, thirsty, and tired, but fortunately we got help from the people, who provided us with tea and meals very enthusiastically. A township office official even gave me a cigarette made of local soil. I was so grateful that I almost cried."</p>
<p>A deep impression was turning in my mind. I seemed to see the tears of gratitude hanging on the corners of the eyes when smoking that local cigarette. Cigarettes for M, and M for cigarettes, they both suggested the true meaning of enjoyment in the integration of life.</p>
<p>This made me suddenly aware of my half-life of ridiculous self-satisfaction. Do I love cigarettes? In fact, I have insulted cigarettes. Am I satisfied with a life of pleasure? What a pale and decadent life!</p>
<p>In the gears of the great era, everything is refined into useful things. Cigarettes, which are usually considered the possessions of hedonists, will also have such a glorious page as M encountered at a certain time.</p>
<p>Whoever is still obsessed with pleasure insults cigarettes, and whoever insults cigarettes is a sinner of the great era.</p>
<p>I took out the last cigarette and gave it a final kiss with awe, in order not to insult you anymore, and in order to cherish myself, we say goodbye forever. Goodbye, cigarettes! Goodbye, that half-life of pleasure!</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Cao Juren (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Zijin</p>
<p>I. A Blue Bamboo Cloth Gown</p>
<p>Mr. Cao wears a blue bamboo cloth gown all year round and a pair of unpainted black leather shoes; sometimes perhaps a pair of black cloth shoes. This society originally emphasizes appearance, so he suffers in this regard.</p>
<p>At banquets and even when lecturing at Jinan University, old-fashioned guests and young master-like college students invariably identified him as a low-ranking servant, a waiter. He said humorously: "Sometimes I really want to put on a neat Western suit and wear a pair of old-fashioned glasses." But from beginning to end, he remained in that bamboo cloth gown, regardless of lush spring, humid summer, desolate autumn, or severe winter.</p>
<p>This person makes people respect him. In the overall picture, the word "plain" must be emphasized for him.</p>
<p>II. The "Mouse" of Scholarly Pursuit</p>
<p>To use a phrase from Anatole France, this person is a "mouse in the library." This not only means that he devours books extensively, but also that his scholarly pursuit is as "refined" and "detailed" as a mouse.</p>
<p>This person grew up in piles of old books. Naturally, he spent a lot of energy on "old paper." But he is not a submissive prisoner of this "national treasure." On the contrary, he handles it like an impartial and alert judge.</p>
<p>There are people in the world whose vision is like a vegetable oil lamp, holding all the ancient books as the Bible, shaking their heads and humming incessantly, unaware that they are being fooled. This person despises this kind of pedantic teacher. Carlyle said: "Readers are inferior, thinkers are average, observers are superior." Scholarly pursuit cannot do without the ability to discern. Pedantic teachers only know how to read blindly, without any spirit of questioning, spending their whole lives reading, but the whole pile of ancient books turns them into inferior Confucian scholars. "A scholar or a licentiate," he said, "are all ignorant peddlers." Isn't this comment excessive?</p>
<p>The second type of scholar that he despises is the "book cabinet" who "absorbs knowledge like the desert of the Gobi absorbs water, but cannot spray a single drop of clear spring onto the ground." It is said that when this person was studying in Hangzhou in his early years, he admired the old scholar Dan Bu'an very much, but the belief that "lasted for twenty years" finally collapsed completely because this Mr. Dan was a book cabinet.</p>
<p>"Mr. Dan Bu'an and I were together for the second time in the West Lake Provincial Library (1927). This meeting completely destroyed my faith in him. He was so knowledgeable, but he didn't have a bit of his own understanding. He read a lot of books, but never formed a system." (Literary Essays, My Reading Experience.)</p>
<p>The French essayist Michel de Montaigne ridiculed this kind of bookworm as someone who needs fire and goes to a neighbor's house to get it, but sees a pile of roaring flames there and stays to warm himself, forgetting to bring it home. ("Do we consider it finished when we preserve other people's opinions and knowledge?" he asked rhetorically: "Even if our stomachs are full of meat, what good does it do us if we cannot digest it, if we cannot transform it into ours, if it cannot increase our development and strength?" (See Education) The most important thing in reading is to never lock the dregs of other people's thoughts into your own mind. Montaigne was so learned and had such a thorough understanding, which made people admire him, and that is the point.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao is also this kind of reader. The admirable aspect of his scholarly pursuit can be summarized in his own words: (1) Always doubt other people and ancient books; (2) Have the courage to betray your own father and teacher; (3) Organize my own system of thought. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>On Human Desire</h3>
<p>— Xiang Tian</p>
<p>The Mirror of Reading, Volume 9, quotes Yang Shen'an as saying:</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, people are born from emotions, how can they be without emotions, but it should not be excessive."</p>
<p>This explains the fundamental reason why human desires should exist. The sages' emphasis on nourishing the mind with few desires and restraining emotions is precisely a mutual illustration. Since there are human desires, there must be eating, drinking, and procreation. Talking about women's rouge, lipstick, dancing, and romance is indispensable, because this is a reasonable expression of the existence of human desires. To put it in modern terms, "the whole life," and the War of Resistance Against Japan is no exception.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote an article about a young refugee from Shanghai who drowned in a swimming pool in Hong Kong, which was strongly opposed by a certain group of people. They said that the War of Resistance should not affect life, and that life during the War of Resistance should not be restricted. They gave reasons that they thought were very reasonable, saying: "The people of Madrid under the madness of bombing still sit in theaters watching movies!"</p>
<p>This reason, which they were very confident in, once overturned my previous views and made me confused for a long time. So I read American magazines that specialize in printing pictures of women's thighs, researched the wonderful methods of applying women's nail polish, and theories about women's socks, dancing, etc., because I thought it seemed that the people of Madrid were also doing this. The other day, I read a predecessor's notes, which said, "The wind and moon of heaven, the flowers and willows of the earth, and the songs and dances of people, without these three, the three talents cannot be formed." It seems that romance, flowers, willows, songs, and dances should all be actively studied, otherwise the "three talents" cannot be formed. So with reason added to reason, I became even more certain.</p>
<p>However, I still have some doubts as to what to do after talking about romance, flowers, willows, songs, dances, women's gloves, high heels, and stockings. Is it to pursue them deeply, or to talk about them idly? Or after talking about them idly, run to the battlefield to dream? These things I still do not understand.</p>
<h3>Ode to the Hero</h3>
<p>— Huang Lu</p>
<p>The sword is broken, the gun is rusted,</p>
<p>The warhorse is tired,</p>
<p>The battle robe is torn,</p>
<p>Your body is also injured,</p>
<p>But ah, your heroic spirit is still the same,</p>
<p>Your eyes are like a prairie fire,</p>
<p>Burning our hearts brightly.</p>
<p>You, the hero of freedom!</p>
<p>May you recover soon,</p>
<p>Pick up brighter swords and guns again,</p>

<p>— Latte</p>
<p>Every evening when there is no wind or rain, in many streets and alleys, there are often middle-aged men who make a living by telling stories, each occupying their own spot, narrating stories from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. Many of the working masses in the neighborhood regard these storytelling places as places to relieve their spare time and boredom, or as places to recover from their day's fatigue.</p>
<p>Yes, many of the working masses in the neighborhood, whether young, middle-aged, or old, all feel that listening to stories seems to be a right that they should enjoy every evening, and taking out two or two copper coins from their wallets seems to be a duty that they should fulfill. The storytellers also seem to have already possessed their audience and should fulfill their own functions and try their best to sell their voices.</p>
<p>We certainly believe that, for a period of time, these countless audiences in the neighborhood were once numbed in the head by absurd and bizarre magical legends, bizarre, colorful, and low-taste wild histories. In the eyes of someone who is truly educating the public and striving for the public, he would undoubtedly feel very dissatisfied, because of this. It is also difficult to avoid the fact that storytellers have been despised and scolded by people with knowledge and insight.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, the war is at its peak and has been attacked from all sides, and has already transformed the content told by these storytellers. What they talk about, and what we can now hear, is mostly the reality of the people's guerrilla war, interesting stories of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the situation of the Soviet Union's assistance to China, the war history of the Spanish anti-fascists, the Chinese anti-traitors, the conspiracy against the advocates of peace, etc. All kinds of news, both domestic and foreign, have been transformed by them into fresh and vivid storytelling material. The bloody warfare of the Chinese nation and the great tide of international anti-fascism make this progressive transformation undoubtedly an effective aid for the propaganda of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>However, we still need to be meticulous in observation, analysis, and strict criticism.</p>
<p>When we listen to the entire content they are telling from beginning to end and observe it carefully, we can discover that their grasp of all parties' affairs and their understanding of the reality of the battle are still very vague, and sometimes even distort a certain part and fabricate a certain part and become harmful teachings to the War of Resistance. This will have a bad impact on countless working-class audiences, which truly cannot but make us vigilant.</p>
<p>Friends who are sincerely doing salvation and propaganda work, now that the second phase of War of Resistance propaganda should be intensified to reach the masses, and now that we should find more assistants for propaganda work, how should we suggest, contact, and encourage these storytellers who are undergoing transformation to correctly carry out War of Resistance storytelling? This should also be said to be our topic, and it is also a part of the propaganda work we want to complete.</p>
<h3>The Snow of Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Be brave, courage is the seed of all success!"</p>
<p>This voice was carried by a gust of wind into his ear. He woke up, as if he had just woken up from a dream, shuddered a few times, and then, he deliberately pressed his index finger tightly against the trigger of the pistol in his pocket, walked briskly to the end of the path, and entered the door.</p>
<p>Inside the room, a glance, it was as if it were a miniature of the Roman Pantheon, illuminated by the wall lamps as bright as day.</p>
<p>He compared everything he saw in the room with the pictures he had in his memory. He immediately knew where the door was; so, like a familiar family member, he knocked on the door and went in.</p>
<p>The house was gorgeous; all the furnishings looked like they had been done by a European home decorator. The pale green light was covered with a pale green lampshade, and the lampshade was embroidered with dark green medieval Roman patterns around it. On one side of the wall, a fireplace was burning, and the raging fire had already reddened the door of the stove, constantly scattering messy red stars. The color tone and warmth of the room made people feel like it was a season between spring and summer. However, in this small world isolated from the cold and sorrowful world, its owner was not seen, and, apart from him, there was no one else.</p>
<p>In an instant, the snow brought on his shoulders and under his boots completely melted into water droplets, some disappearing into the barely visible threads of the seams of his clothes, and some falling on the impermeable floor.</p>
<p>The moment now is as long as a year in the past.</p>
<p>He paced anxiously, waiting; finally, he was somewhat disappointed. But he was unwilling to leave in disappointment. Regardless of success or failure, he had to get one of the results in his heart.</p>
<p>When he saw the leather coat on the coat rack and the overshoes under the bed, he believed that the owner had absolutely not gone out even two steps. In his disappointment, hope gradually revived.</p>
<p>Almost five minutes passed, and there was no sound of footsteps coming from outside the door; the only thing he heard was the sound of a piano in another room, as if someone was practicing a piece they were playing for the first time: sometimes it was an incomplete rhythm, and sometimes it was a fragmented scale. Therefore, he thought:</p>
<p>"Is it her? Is she playing the piano?" (7)</p>
