<h3>意大利南部之大地震</h3>

<p>由是可知凡人類之性情歷史。與其人所處之地土。至有關係。日本與意之種種相。似實因兩國之人。同處於火山帶地而然。同處於火山帶地。故其人之性情歷史相似。同處於火山帶地。故大地震之來襲亦相似。因大地震之相似。我乃感及於其民族歷史之相似。人類與所處土地之之有關係。其可忽視哉。</p>

<h3>華聯健將缺席</h3>
<p>華聯之實力、素甚雄厚、即傾華南全師之力、亦被其擊敗此交仍健將三人、因雪蘭莪球隊、前日與去礁埠球隊、舉行年例銀杯比賽、故該球員不便於短促期内、而參預此場比賽、三健將之缺席、應嚮於全隊實力頗大也</p>
<h3>二守門顯身手</h3>
<p>五時己屆、由西人裁判員召集雙方攝影及抽籤、中華佔南城、聯隊佔北城、先由聯隊開球、球一旋轉、被華隊左輔李惠堂、蹴入聯隊陣地、聯隊後方不備、球忽飛進城前、幸守門楊亞九眼明手快、將球接獲、復失手落地、於千鈞一髮之際、亞九用敏捷手叚、始解圍脫險、此後仍未踼出陣地、被華隊連射二次、均被亞九接獲、未幾華隊犯截球、聯隊乘機攻進華隊陣地、正緊急之時、幸右衛馮運佑救出華隊乘勢反攻、球滾入聯隊陣地、華隊忽越界、但聯隊仍未能得勢踼出陣線、復受壓迫犯左角球、幸舉射不準、始脫險反攻、迫入華隊陣地、由左右兩翼舉射二次均不命中、華隊乘勢進攻、惟忽犯截球被敵反攻、聯隊得後方救出、未幾復受攻、幸守門亞九接獲救出、始乘勢反攻華隊陣地、由前鋒連射二次、均被守門周賢言獲救、</p>
<h3>中華不幸越位</h3>
<p>未幾華隊乘反攻聯隊、得左翼舉射、但未命中聯隊脫圍反攻直至華隊城前得左輔張忠萬連舉二球、均由城左滾出界外、此後在中場、聯隊犯規一次、華隊亦犯規一次、聯隊復受攻、危在煞耶間、幸被守門亞九接獲聯隊乘機反攻進華隊陣地、球由城右滾出、聯隊亦受相同對待、有一球將入網滾至城柱側、正危急時、不幸華隊越界、始被聯隊脫險、未幾華隊犯手球二次、光陰迅速、時五點三十五分、裁判員鳴笛休息、上半場不分勝負、成和局、</p>
<h3>戴中鋒開紀錄</h3>
<p>下半塲易地、由中華開球、乘機直進、聯隊受迫犯右角球、幸未中、未幾復犯右角球墮落城中、守門亞九因朝日之故、難以接應、緊急舉手托出、被華隊中鋒戴麟經用頭撞入一球、查戴麟經是中華福將、每出塲必中球、在遠東對菲隊連中三中華遠征足球隊戴麟經蹴中新加坡華僑聯合隊第一球之影</p>
<p>元、對日本亦中兩球、繼起交鋒、聯球復犯右角、不能脫出重圍、未幾復被中華中鋒戴麟經再踼入一球、眞名不虚傳之福將也、繼起聯隊仍受壓迫犯右角、但華隊舉射不準、球墜城後、踼出復犯手球、幸未十分危險、此時聯隊各球員、希圖報復一二、努力奮鬥、反攻樂隊陣地、連攻二次均未中、至第三次忽犯越界、華隊乘勢反攻亦攻二次不中、華隊忽犯截球、勢始稍挫、復受攻二次、均不中、此後聯隊犯左右角二次、華隊犯規一次、均未有若何成績、</p>
<h3>華聯最後努力</h3>
<p>最後五分鐘、觀衆心理、均以爲聯隊無報復之機會、未幾球滾入華隊陣地、聯隊右輔黄吉河、傳球與左翼馮文勳、球迫至華隊城前、文勳左足一踼、球應聲入網、中華始負一球、復繼起交鋒之際、惟無情之銀笛一吹、各鳴鑼收隊、結束爲二比一、中華隊獲勝、</p>

<h3>敎部編審圖書過經</h3>
<p>注音符號傳習小册</p>
<p>三民主義千字課</p>
<p>敎育部編審趙廷爲日前在中央廣播無線電臺、報告編審圖書經過、原文如下</p>
<p>半年以來敎育部編審處對於圖書編審的工作除了繼續審查敎科圖書及編譯科學名詞以外、特别注重民衆讀物的編輯、現　在有兩種民衆讀物己經脫稿、一種是注算符號傳習小册、還有一種是三民主義千字課、這兩種民衆讀物、都是夺中央命令而編輯的、</p>
<p>注音符號傳習小册分爲兩部分、、前一部分是注音符號及拚音練習、後一部分是課文、並附列敎學槪要及注音簦號發音略說供敎師參考之用這本注音簦號傳習小册裏面的課文、是用有連貫意義的韻文編成的、不但對於注音簦號的拚音、有極多的反覆練習、而且讀起來也頗有興味、這可以算是注音符號傳習小册最重要的特色注音符號傳習小册的編輯時間、不到一個月的工夫、所以還可說是一種比較輕易的工作但是編輯三民主義千字課、手續異常繁重、今天我想把三民主義千字課的編輯經過情形、大略的報告一下、三民主義千字課的編輯、包含三項工作第一是選字、就是從將近一百萬字的材料當中、統計出最常用的一千餘字作爲三民主義千字課用字的根據第二是選材就是用縝密的方法、選出最重要的關於三民主義歷史地理自然衛生等科的村、作爲三民主義千字課課文的材料第三是編輯課文、課文編好了以後三民主義千字課才算是編輯完成、兹將這三項工作的大槪情形簡單的分述如左、（一）選字工作選字工作的第一步是搜集材料作爲選字的根據、我們就在很短的時間内搜集到下列各類的材料第一類、總理遺著三民主義、建國大綱、實業計劃、孫文學說第一次全國代表大會宣言、民權初步六種第二類、宣傳刊物、七項運動傳宣册、總理關於青年農工商的遺敎、撤廢領判權運動等十二種、第三類、法規和文告自治法規七種、文告八十一件、第四類日報和刊物政府公報、日報、及雜誌五種、第五類、通俗圖書、上下古今談等十種、第六類雜類書信五百九十七封、簿據五十件廣告五十一張、招貼、招牌約五百六十餘件、</p>
<p>選字工作的第二步是計字、敎育部編審處全體人員都担任計字的工作、爲求簡捷計我們用部首分部、來統計各字發現的次數、各材料的總字數如下第一類計三十二萬四千四百五十二字、佔全字數五一·五二四百分數、第二類計十一萬零三百七十四字、佔全字數一七、五二一百分數、第三類計二萬一千四百六十二字、佔全字數二·四○七百分數、第四類、計五萬五千九百三十六字、佔全字數八·八一一百分數、第五類、計二萬七千九百七十一字、佔全字數六·五一五百分數第六類、計七萬九千七百五十五字、佔全字數一二·六六二百分數共計六十二萬九千九百五十字、選字工作的第三步、是從計字所得的次數裏、抽出各個單字發見次數最多和較多的、依次數的多少、排列起來彙集的結果是次數在一○○一以上者計一百二十字、次數在五○一到一○○○之間者、計一百七十九字次數在二○一到五○○之間者計二百九十六字次數在一○一到二○○之間者、計三百零五字次數在九一到一○○之間者計四十四字、次數在八一到九○之間者、計四十八字、次數在七一到八○之間者、計六十一字、次數在六一到七○之間者、計六十四字、次數在五○到六○之間者計九十二字次數在五○字以下者從略次數在五○字以上者、合計共一千一百八十九字、這次的選字、因爲時間過於忽促、搜集的材料太少、（還不滿一百萬字）所以還不十分可靠、因此三民主義千字課的用字有百分之八十是根據這次選字的結果有百分之二十仍舊根據常識的判斷、（二）選材工作因爲三民主義千字課的編輯、不僅要敎民衆識字還要灌輸各種智識所以我們對於課文材料的選擇、不得不特别審愼編審處特設三民主義千字課選材委員會、負責去做選材的工作、關於選材方法上的特點有四、（未完）</p>

<p>兇手逃逸　趙夫人及車夫、在車中亦聞槍聲甚晣、但無法救護、保鏢劉華年廿五歲、山東人、本任該局碼頭稽查、平日隨護、恒帶手槍、昨因更換新照會、尚未領出、故同車隨護、僅以徒手翊衛、兇手開槍後、劉華乘勢撲地、僞作受傷狀、及保鏢由地起身、隨衆追捕、兇手巳逃逸無踪、乃急電捕房、捕房立飭大隊武裝探捕、馳赴出事地點視察一過、並派探到醫院詳詢經過情形、當令嚴緝兇犯、至兇手究有幾人、據該局目擊者談、兇手計有三人、一穿熟羅長衫·一穿玄色印度綢長衫·一穿藍布短衫褲·混在包車夫之内、故絕不注意、及趙到局、即由穿熟羅長衫者、袖出手槍、向趙背後開放二槍、一彈從右肋射進、從胸側穿出、另一彈則擬擊保鏢而未中云、</p>

<h3>洪深供述出事時情形</h3>
<p>據洪深述稱、二月二十二日午後三時、偕一友人往大光明觀所映不怕死影片、甫及其半、實不忍再觀、我乃獨自返家、至五時許、復獨往、約五時二十分、我乃對衆演說、第二次之往、原欲找初次同往之友、冀詢該片後段之情形、迨抵該戲院門首、見有學生數人、正在該處評論、有主張將該片内容函告民國日報、請其披露者、緣先一日巳有三十五人、聯名致函於該報、亦係述此片侮辱華人事、亦有主張當衆演說者、我因學生或有激烈主動、故勸止之、並即入内、對觀衆演述該片之内容、惟今巳隔多時、對於片中情節、大都遺忘、僅記得其間之一段、大致有一華人賣花、羅克因購其花、乘機欲發金錢、衆華人爭拾之、致釀成互毆事、嗣羅克購花歸、於花盆内發現纍纍之鴉片烟土、此外則有華大光明案開審情形有者爲洪深</p>
<p>（莫天祥攝）</p>
<p>人之爲盜匪爲綁票之種種不齒情事、我昔亦曾赴美、所見華僑、從無有如此行爲者、片名不怕死、揣其命名之意、當係謂華人皆怕死、彼羅克獨不怕死、竟得破獲此華人之販土機關、我初次即欲有言、因同往之友勸我不必多事、故負氣歸寓、適冷甚、乃將所服西裝、易以中裝、復再前往、在台前演說、略謂觀衆應各有愛國心、對於此、最低亦應退票、不必如意國人之燬其片衆即紛紛起立、往外退票、而場内仍有一部份人向我詢問片之内容、旋退票者復入内、謂票房不肯退票、請諳西語者往交涉、我徇衆請、即往外面、見一西人、詢知我係演說者、彼謂將欲拘我、遂被拖入經理室、我雖操西語向之警告、該西人仍抓住我衣、此時有三捕到案、將我拘去、至該西人查隸英籍、名加爾斯、我當對拘我之西捕、謂尚有一帽、一圍巾、須帶去、而西捕則答曰、汝之損失、當不僅區區帽與圍巾耳、自被拖往經理室以至出外、約歷七八分鐘、西捕拘我、甫出門口、遇鄭小秋、當告以情形、着速以電話報告明星公司、爲我請律師營救、中途我屢詢所犯何罪、何人主張拘捕、該西捕答我以係加爾斯所命、及至捕房、向捕頭報告、亦方爲加爾斯所囑、該西捕述畢所語即去、瞬又復返云、任我略坐而釋、我在捕房、站立至八時始出、先是捕頭見我到、彼立即親往大光明調查、移時歸來、向我云、此片侮辱華人太甚、無怪華人氣憤、渠且不能滿意、因片内復有侮辱警察處也、該捕頭又言最好將其内容宣諸報紙、或請市黨部取締、旋命我出外、我以無端被拘、堅不欲出、該捕頭云、非渠拘我、乃係請我到捕房談談也、惟當該捕頭赴大光明調查之際、有一捕執警棍、殊兇惡、旣作申申之詈、復欲舉棍相擊、指我係共産黨、謂國家正嚴捕共黨、曷不將此人禁於鐵欄之内、幸經他人告以現由捕頭往查、待歸自當發落、該捕纔不再言、我於離捕房之前、擬再往大光明索帽與圍巾、捕頭恐去、或别生枝節、着勿必再往、被告高永清、當將我雖未見、但從各方旁證、確可證實報告其時親在戲院、緣風潮發生之後、高嘗邀鄭小秋、</p>
<h3>高永清聲明不在戲院</h3>
<p>訊據被告高永清供稱、此片方於二月三四日向派拉蒙公司租賃、普通影片應先明其内容、若明星主演者、以震於其名、不暇計及内容、周庭長訊之曰、此片與我華人旣多不佳、何必租賃、高答稱、因巳經租界審查委員會審查、且給有審查執照、此會乃英法兩工部局所組織、會員中外咸有、租片最少須映七天、而此片自二月廿一日開映、至廿四日即遵黨部令停止、我每日必赴戲院、但是日則因友人康腦脫路五五號葉姓家出殯、我於午後二時、前往執紼、送至日清碼頭、六時半歸家、故日間絕足未至戲院、到家後、接戲院電話、報告、始悉發生退票事件、以事巳了結、故於夜間九時、才赴戲院、並未與鄭小秋談話、或鄭誤認他人、鄭前次之證言、我俱聽見、故今巳將與鄭談話、之證人邀到、至於送殯六時半歸家一節、凡同往執紼者皆知、惟此類人證今未邀來、</p>
<h3>永吉與永清面貌甚似</h3>
<p>被告之律師蔣保釐起立聲稱、今邀案之證人、一名高永吉、一名鄭子章、係欲證明是日由鄭子章請鄭小秋上樓與高永吉談話一點、永吉乃被告胞弟、貌與被告相若、當時鄭小秋或誤弟作兄、周庭長即飭庭丁往庭外傳喚高永吉至案、永吉、年念二歲、僅面部皮膚、較乃兄稍白、餘如五官、身段、却有相似之狀、</p>
<h3>永吉證明與小秋談話</h3>
<p>旋據永吉證稱、在大光明票房辦事、二月廿一日午後六時、我至戲院、退票　潮已意、與鄭小秋素不相識、惟向聞其名、是日係鄭子章自動邀小秋調解、因小秋之父正秋、亦在明星公司與原告同事、且有交誼、故央小秋轉請其父念桑梓之情、居間排解、談話係在樓上、室内祗我及子章小秋三人、當時小秋滿口好好、我乃於晚間八時、前往兄家、向兄報告、至九時我回家、而兄則仍在家、周庭長因永吉所述時間與永清不符、因諭之曰、頃據爾兄供、彼於九時至大光明、而爾云九時尚在家、是彼此不符矣、永吉即答稱、此或稍有遺忘、實不能確定其時間、又傳證人鄭子章、訊據證稱、在大光明服務、是日、我託鄭小秋挽其父調停、但彼無切實答復、並由原告律師姚永勵·詹紀鳳·向該證人略詰數語、</p>
<h3>小秋否認曾晤鄭子章</h3>
<p>庭上飭傳鄭小秋至案、據稱、我前次所述、尚能記憶、當時請求調停者、確係被告本人、其弟則從未見過、而邀我上樓者、乃大光明之職員、周庭長訊以是否即鄭子章、小秋向子章諦視一過、即稱並非此人、</p>
<h3>小秋與子章二人對質</h3>
<p>庭上乃令兩鄭對質、於是子章向小秋曰、當時係我在玻璃門口呌你上樓、且祗有我一人、你何忘之耶、小秋亦答之曰、你所言不對了、當時我與顔鶴眠行至玻璃門畔、彼此談話之際、突來一人、向我云老板呌你、我初不去、經其人强而後行、倘此人今亦到來、我尚能辨認、並答蔣律師曰、確係與被告談話、</p>
<h3>證人鄭鶴眠陳述經過</h3>
<p>次傳訊證人顔鶴眠、據稱、在明星公司攝影、二月廿一日、與友蔡姓同往觀劇、到時巳發生退票風潮、觀者正紛紛出院、遇小秋於門口、經彼告知原因、正互談間、來一西裝者、將小秋喚回該院、我欲隨去、因門首巡捕阻止、嗣見張蝕川到來、我乃入院、喚小秋出、至小秋被西裝者喚去何事、彼未僣我言、但該西裝者體瘦、無鄭子章之胖云云、</p>
<h3>雙方證人均須再傳喚</h3>
<p>庭上又傳洪深訊問未到案之證人有幾、何時能到、洪曰、尚有兩人、皆不在滬、其中一人係學生、諒必可回、餘一人來否不知云云、又訊被告欲陸鼎揆證明何事、高曰、彼可證明是日我不在院、周庭長宣稱、陸今不到、係因將其門牌錯誤、無從傳達之故、本案雙方人證、旣皆未齊、應再改期、以便傳喚、</p>
<h3>伍澄宇請求從速進行</h3>
<p>而蔣律師遂請求傳拘洪深之西捕到案作證、並謂該西捕現巳請假、須三星期後銷假、如延期則請展至三星期後、但原告律師、對此證人、咸稱非必要、伍澄宇律師且以此案拖延太久、請求從速進行、末由周庭長裁决、候定期續審、</p>
<h3>未完工之新屋突然坍圮</h3>
<p>有二人受傷無大碍</p>
<p>坍屋之原因不可知</p>
<p>車馬騁馳之靜安寺路、其戈登與慕爾鳴路間一段、昨晚七八時間、交通忽告斷絕、驟而圍觀者、數以千計、車輛壅塞、道左行人、無法通行、祗見救火人員、穿逐路中、在以富麗麗見稱之大華飯店對面、拆搬已經崩坍之三樓新屋、耳際轟然巨響、屋頂即乘勢而下、中西人士之作壁上之觀者、嘖嘖稱贊救火員工作之敏捷、而自命爲眼福不淺也、靠近慕爾鳴路靜安寺路一百五十三號之新建屋房、共有六宅、昨日下午三時一刻左右、東首四宅之三樓、突然崩坍、　啦一聲、塵烟四飛、洋台宣告脫離、天花板亦不禁落地、當時有泥水匠學徒及路人各一名、被磚瓦碰傷、揷圖示出事後之房屋情形、惟入晚以後、則諸屋咸巳露頂、無復新造房子之氣象矣、坍屋攝影（王小亭攝）</p>
<h3>六宅中坍四宅</h3>
<p>昨日所坍之屋計四宅、咸靠靜安寺路、蓋建築西式之店面市房也、是一聯計六宅、西二宅未遭波及、亦云幸矣、承造此屋者爲利順營造廠、共四十八宅、店面而外、均係西式住屋、全部地基頗大、前臨靜安寺路、後達威海衛路、東西則介乎戈登路與慕爾鳴路之間、統分四區、自西徂東、而算第一區、係華中公司承造、計二十九宅、第二區陸順記造、五十八宅、第三區建記營造廠承築、屋數與遭殃之利順相同、亦係四十八宅</p>
<h3>大聲作房屋倒</h3>
<p>利順營造廠承建之一區、開工於去年九月中旬、原定本年底竣工、今春又更改屋樣、致又延期、惟預計則再兩個月者、即可蕆事矣、靠東所坍之四宅、其水木工程大體上巳次第完竣、故出事時、樓上樓下工人極少、有之、惟學徒等稍加修理耳、昨日下午三時一刻許、忽有大聲發自三樓、待工人等口呼不好、巳經墻倒頂陷、洋台飄摇、磚瓦亂飛、</p>
<h3>學徒行人受傷</h3>
<p>是役遭殃者兩人、一係學徒孫阿河、奉師傳命出外購買捲烟、正在移步往外、而磚木飛下、正中頭面、且絆跌地上、兩足亦受損傷、更一人則係路行經過之田紅福、亦遭壓傷、均由西捕車送寳隆醫院治療、尚無大碍、學徒孫阿河、二十歲、南海人、行人田紅福、天津人、五十三歲、</p>
<h3>救火車之施救</h3>
<p>出事後、中央及新閘救火會等立即驅車馳往施救、一時紅車畢集、鈴聲鏘鏘、白晝倒屋意外之事、即喧傳於附近一帶、好奇者前往觀看、絡繹於途、謡傳有五六人壓死碎瓦斷木之下、則無稽耳、救火員首將受傷者車送醫孮台療、然後從事敏捷之工作、以保公衆安全、</p>
<h3>摧枯拉朽工作</h3>
<p>八時間、路上行人麕集、數以千計、大華飯店短垣之外、攀援探望者、口講指畫、津津有味、救火員先以升高之梯上昇、至最高處以繩端繫於己坍未落之屋頂上然後往下拖拉、一聲巨響、屋頂即下、摧枯拉朽、此之謂也、如是者數、而危險之狀乃大减、</p>
<h3>坍屋原因待考</h3>
<p>屋主聞係張某、而承造者爲中國營業公司、利順營造廠、廠主爲甬人林文興、至其崩坍原因、則言人人殊、非待專家考證、不能揣測、或謂因埋置陰溝在屋旁挖土打樁、因而牽引是屋、姑存是說、以作參考、</p>

<h3>誤認事主爲賊之趣劇公羽</h3>
<p>有陳某者。在滬　居一屋。舍母妻外。有子女七人。及女僕一人。故祇亭子間分租於同鄕李某餘屋悉以自住。陳爲紹興籍。近因妻妹出閣。岳氏招其妻及陳回籍。而陳之故父。亦適逢十周忌辰。母欲回籍建蘸。故於月初舉宅返里。其家在紹。原爲望族。伯叔昆季甚衆。陳亦尚有胞弟二。執業本地。其一巳娶妻生子是以其母欲遄回作佛事也。陳僅在籍三日。上海事冗。未克多留。不及候至妻妹嫁期。即已返滬。寓屋中昔日熙熙攘攘者。今乃闃無聲息。幸尚有一房客。稍破寂寞。惟李某並無家眷。日間陳李皆出外辦事。無人守戸。不得已扃其門。各佩一鑰於身。隨時可啓。陳職業較優。休息甚早。五時即散值。李則須八時始能畢事。進晚膳而歸也。十六日。陳有他事。歸寓稍晏。見大門洞啓。以爲李已歸矣。而心中頗咎李疏忽。不闔雙扉。及登樓。電燈通明。忽睹箱籠狼藉滿地。大驚。呼李又無應者。略一檢視。則貴重之衣物盡杳。陳妻去後。箱籠皆上鎖。至是無一不被撬破。明明爲樑上君子光顧之現象。遂踉蹌下樓。甫及梯半。突遇兩巡捕。見陳之倉皇態度。疑即是賊。一捕伸巨靈之掌。撾其臂。力猛。臂大震痛。理智頓失。一時竟不知剖白。但挣扎圖脫。巡捕又誤會其欲逃。握之愈力。更舉其又一手。槶陳之頰。且摑且詈。牽之下樓。同來之巡捕從而助之。左推右　。陳眞爲罪人矣。至客堂。一捕負監守責。一捕擬登樓檢查。而李巳岔息至。睹狀駭絕。陳旣見李。理智亦清。泣呼曰。是何爲者。李曰。家中失竊。故報捕也。兩捕聞語。不禁木然有頃。詰陳曰。汝非竊賊耶。陳曰。我爲此屋主人。安所謂竊賊者。兩捕乃知誤會。道歉不巳。蓋陳家眷離滬。日間無人。樑上君子乘機光顧。李回寓時。賊巳滿載而去。急在馬路問報捕。陳適歸來。李偕兩捕至。步趨稍後。遂演成此一齣匪夷所思之趣劇。天壤間巧不可階之事。當無過於此者矣。友人梁君談。</p>
<h3>伶界聯合會迎梅記知</h3>
<p>上海伶界聯合會以梅蘭芳赴美表演。載譽而歸。特於前日在九畝地會所爲盛大之歡迎茶話會。到者數百人。四時入座。梅氏及同行諸角色均準時到會。首由伶聯會代表致歡迎詞云。「北平梅館長畹華同志。具登峰造極之才。抱偉大之志。遠涉重洋。考察新大陸之藝術。來改良中國戲劇。同時介紹中國劇藝於外邦。轟動全美。譽騰全球。爲中國數千年未有良中國戲劇。同時介紹中國劇藝於外邦。轟動全美。譽騰全球。爲中國數千年未有之創舉。開伶界史上無上光榮之新紀錄。梅同志北返之後。必有偉大之計畫。以革新中國戲劇。兹乘梅同志返國途經上海之便。伶界聯合會同人特開會歡迎。聊盡地主之誼。順請梅同志不棄鄙陋。以此行經過情形指敎。以廣同人之見聞。以增同人之智識。伶　界幸甚。中國幸甚。繼由周信芳君演說關於中外戲劇藝術之異同。及近代思潮所波及戲劇者。一一窮源盡流。爲有統系之澈底研究。詞多精警。最後由梅氏及李斐叔分别答詞。兹附梅氏答詞於後。散會巳七時許矣。</p>
<p>梅氏答詞</p>
<p>請位先生。蘭芳在去美國的時候。蒙貴會諸位先生的歡送。今天回來。又蒙貴會這樣的招待。蘭芳心上是非常的感謝。這一次去美國。去了六個月了。在紐約、芝加哥、舊金山、羅省、檀香、這五處地方演唱。雖然不能充分的來發揚我們中國的戲劇。但是結果。西方人對於中國戲的批評。是非常的圓滿。</p>
<p>蘭芳這次在美國。因爲應酬同演戲的事情狠忙。所以對於西方戲劇的情形。不能詳細的調查。不過簡單的去看了下子。雖然看得不多。但是我的心上。已經是十二分的佩服同羨慕。</p>
<p>我們中國的戲劇界。這幾年以來。實在是太不能振作了。尤其是戲劇的本身上。漸漸的衰微。新的旣沒有人來創造。舊的又沒有人去保存。這是多們的危險呢。在西方不問新的舊的。人家都看得非常的重要。而且他們常常有新的東西出來。像他們這種富於創造的精神。是我們都應當去快快學的。</p>
<p>我們中國的舊戲。裏面很有許多很好的東西。這次在美國。美國人看得很爲重要。所以蘭芳希望國内諸位同志。快快的把它保存起來。同時也應當整理整理。好讓它能夠適合現代民衆的需要。</p>
<p>蘭芳這次離美國的時候。美國的人都去。並且很盼望國内同志能夠多多的去。所以蘭芳很希望諸位同志。大家一齊來替中國戲努力。把中國的藝術。多多的運輸到西方。去蘭芳並且很願意來替諸位計劃計劃。</p>
<p>說到這裏。我又想起中國的劇界的團結力。太嫌薄弱。於我們戲劇前途的進展</p>
<h3>筆會緣起（下）</h3>
<p>以上是關於筆會的一些梗槪。它從成立以來還不到十年。但它已經發見了不少可做的有用與重要的事。前途儘有更擴大的希冀。我們現在發起組織中國筆會的一個顯明的意思當然是借此我們的作家可以與全世界的作家有一個友誼的聯綫。并且享到因此得來的種種利便。但我們同時還有一個也許更深切一些的意思。那就是我們看了近年來國内文學界的分裂又分裂乃至相與敵對相與尋仇的現象覺得有些寒心。這筆會的組織。或許可以造成一個中性的調劑的勢力。所謂各系各派間的成見與誤解或許可以由此消滅。更正確的文學的任務或許可以由此提醒。我們但須一看各地筆會的會員錄以及筆會的報告即可以知道筆會的功用。在他的會席上不僅坐着德奥與法比的作（在歐戰嫌隙尚未消解時）。同時欣然相聚首的有在主張上絕不一致的作家。亨利巴比塞不是頗左的一位作家嗎。他是筆會的會員。高爾基不是年老而不「落」伍的一個作家嗎。他是筆會的會員。在英國肅伯訥與成爾思不是在時代思想的前面站着的嗎。他們和保守的或「右」翼的作家一樣欣欣的加入筆會的活動。這些例子應得使我們所謂各派的作家放寛一些度量。讓我們至少在這一件事上彼此不時有一個友誼的聚晤的機會。至少在這一件事上中此可以把一切的「不同」和「差異」暫時放在一邊。這樣也許可以節省許多在彼此無謂的鬥爭彼的一些精力。移向更近人情的事業不更好嗎。歐戰時雙方對壘的兵士在休息期内時常各自爬出濠溝。彼此交換着禮物。劃着火柴一起吸烟。夥伴似的弟兄似的說着話。雖則在下一點鐘他們或許受長官的指揮拿無情的砲火來彼此殘毁。一個詩人在他的一首詩内寫一隻迷了路的島飛到地獄裏去唱他的歌。這歌聲不但使在黑暗的囚禁中的鬼魂都記起了生前的光亮與颼景。并且還有</p>
<p>ＳＯＭＥ　ＯＮＥ　ＴＨＥＲＥ　ＳＴＯＬＥ　ＦＯＲＴＨ　Ａ　ＨＡＮＤ</p>
<p>ＴＯ　ＤＲＡＷ　Ｇ　ＬＲＯＴＨＥＲ　ＴＯ　ＨＩＳ　ＳＩＤＥ</p>
<p>我們這些日子祇感覺到在我們周圍黑暗與恐怖一天濃密似一天。這前途儘着去能有光亮嗎。難道眞的非得一切都陷入了黑暗才能省悟光亮的可貴嗎。非得到仇恨與怨毒像　劍戟似的插滿了人道的營壘才能發生彼此原是同根的覺悟嗎。那時候是太遲了。</p>
<p>現在我們下面列名的發起筆會的中國分會。謙卑的。誠懇的。邀請國内的作家加入。蔡元培楊杏佛胡適之曾孟樸葉恭綽宗白華徐志摩戈公振謝壽康林語堂鄭振鐸邵洵美唐腴廬郭有守。很有妨碍。而且像海外的許多同志。都應當有相當的維護提倡。所以蘭芳乘今天的盛會。十二分的希望全中國的劇界同志。趕快的聯合起來。組織一個全國統一的團體。來謀我們戲劇上的進展。同生活上的利益。這是蘭芳這次游美歸來。心上所最布望於戲界同志的一件大事。</p>
<p>蘭芳今天很有許多的話想同諸位談談。但是又不是很短的時間之内。就可以說完的。所以今天只好不說了。只盼望能夠下次常常有機會再來詳詳細細的談。好實現蘭芳心中所期望於我們中國戲劇界的許多大事。今天謝謝。</p>
<p>在舊金山的時候。廣東劇界的同志。在那邊很多。蘭芳到那邊的時候。如同一家人。彼此相見都非常的愉快。聚會過好幾次。他們跑到幾萬里之外。這種精神毅力。眞是令人敬佩。</p>

<h3>洋厘漲跌互見</h3>
<p>市塲槪况　近日溽暑蒸人、人心與市氣均爲之餒然不振更兼同業中多缺兩方略有競爭、是故早午兩市厘價差離甚遠、然此仍爲一種平常交易、與厘價前途實無何種關係、非若銷路暢旺之可同日語焉、</p>
<p>厘拆價格「洋厘」早市形勢忽然軟滯、厘價跌去厘餘、爲七錢二分七厘六毫二忽半、較前日早市計跌一厘一毫二忽半、午市忽又回昻爲七錢二分八厘半、結果較前晨略小二毫半、而經過之漲落間早午之進出、折耗已屬不貲矣、一銀拆」早午兩市皆開四分、較前日又弱一二分、銀行掛牌無市、劃頭始終白劃、</p>
<p>輔幣市情、江南小洋早市爲六錢三分二厘午市爲六錢三分一厘、結果較前日小去一厘做出交易早市三千角、午市一千五百角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢一分三厘八毫七忽半、午市爲六錢一分三厘二毫半、結果小去二厘七毫半、做出交易早市十二萬五千角、午市五萬角銅元忽長五千文、爲三百八十六千文、</p>

<h3>證劵債市賣氣轉旺</h3>
<p>昨日各債市况、現貨僅編遣成交五千元、續大整六各三千元、其他均無交易、期貨上午頗活動、成交六百三十萬元、但後市一盤沉靜、計開出一百八十七萬元、合計八百八十餘萬元、至言變動情形、前市初開、因市上賣出交易較旺、故價即轉疲勢、下午交易不多、趨勢益呆、結果大致回漲四五角左右云、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市略轉緊勢</h3>
<p>紗市較硬、海外花紗雖一致趨向下游而本埠市氣、未受若何影響、反見挺秀、實以買方拉緊、始終不肯放鬆、而十支粗紗、銷路良好、徐州帮大批吸進下月期粗紗、亦係含投機性質、又以月底時期接近、散戸扒空較衆故市勢見緊、本月份上漲、遠月被其牽動也、</p>
<p>人標先跌後漲　前市開盤、以美棉發現新價、人心甚虚、幸場中賣戸未見濃厚、各月祗跌三四錢、二三盤扒空者稍衆、稍稍回漲、結果平平、午後市勢愈堅各月均漲四、五、六、七、八、錢、全日成交統計六千○五十包、查賣出義成八百包爲最多、裕大、森康、勤豐、利昌和愼二百包至八百包、買進茂記、天隆、泰昌、德記、元泰、協生、義餘益昶泰興二百包至四百包、兹將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>近期棉獨漲四錢</h3>
<p>棉市近月頗堅、實以散戸抛空者太多、市氣一轉、反動愈劇、雖美棉頻現新低價、然本埠棉市、未受打擊、蓋七八兩月陳花、買方吸收加碼、且商塲上傳聞八月份軋空聲浪甚高、故買氣旺盛、市勢愈緊、市價上漲、不過外棉趨跌、遠月抛賣者尚不乏人、故新花市况獨疲、</p>
<p>漢標陳漲新跌　漢標前市開盤、以美棉又破一角三分關口、未開盤前、人心恐慌、預料竟有三四錢之跌風、拍至八月份、大戸購進、市盤尤緊、漲一錢、遠月以洋花關係、跌一錢、結果近漲二錢、遠跌五分、午後近月形勢仍堅、又漲二錢、遠月跌五分、全日成交統計五萬七千一百担、賣出和愼三千五百担、爲最多、此外天隆·永昌·同興·永豐·達記·恒德·怡隆·德記·源大一千至二千担、買進恒益三千一百擔最多、和愼·裕大·同興·元泰·利昌·晋豐·茂記·勤豐一千四百至二千八百担、兹將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食東新粳見跌半元</h3>
<p>陳白粳一落千丈</p>
<p>閘北　昨日各路來船十餘號、走銷依然不振、各貨一律狂跌、常帮白粳又短兩三角、刻下特頂粳巳開進二十一關内、東新粳陡跌半元、價開二十元零五角至三角、本報早言價難站立、今果下游矣羊秈賣戸見旺、緣售貨略多、市因洋米步跌而續短、變元一跌四五角、回風甚銳、觀察十八元半之高貨恐尚須修削全日此問河存見厚、各貨因銷呆而見跌也、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到貨不多、去路甚滯、船粳廠機粳賣氣極旺、進戸寥寥、價跌三角左右、普通高貨己在二十元關口、中次之批降益足、目前破粳竟一落千丈、薄稻貨亦稍旺、本街進胃大淡、價亦逐盤而短、情勢甚弱、羊杜尖隨洋米而下游、市高勉開十九元左右、白元初尚平平、繼因北市報小、遂回落兩三角、市勢異常疲弱、</p>
<h3>小絞糙貶價暢銷</h3>
<p>昨日洋米行情、依然疲跌、形勢似有一蹶不振之象、貨主因天時合宜、新米早稻不日上市、均有貶價求脫之心、昨日各米貶小數角、始由杭帮及本街内地散戸等問津、開出共有萬餘包、市面有貶價求脫之心、昨日各米貶小數角、始由杭帮及本街内散戸等問津、開出共有萬餘包、市面尚形活絡、小絞糙存貨較多、上午跌價至十元○五角、仍難暢銷、下午甩小至十元○二三角、始見活潑、開出有八千餘包、其他各白秈共開五千包左右、價亦較小二三角計小絞米十四元一角半、次至十三元半、大絞十一元八角、次至五角半、二號西貢次十三元○五分、敏黨十三元八九角、可盖米十三元六角、小絞糙則小四五角云、</p>
<h3>多頭出籠麥市回疲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥本月份曾一度受軋、最高開至四兩七錢四分、惟遠期則仍平定、迨至下午開盤、本月份因多頭思乘機出檔、空戸抵補之心思反懈、比較上午開價軟去幾分、微聞本月份之多頭、實係内地之客戸、因了結虧耗太巨、探知此番之交割貨量、多頭均不合交易所之標準、故最後結果、終須收進幾車矣、結果本月份較前日回小三分、八月份小一分九月份小二分、十月份小一分、十一十二月份小二分、現麥廠胃仍不見佳、高貨因尚合廠家進胃、喊高二分、中次則反落二三分不等、此種景象、仍係提高殺次之局、開高郵沙市漢口儀徵麥共四千七百餘包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<h3>粉市復呈堅稳</h3>
<p>廠家鎭定···近期浮空抵補</p>
<p>午日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份大致復呈堅稳、本月份因大小廠家對於月底之交割、均鮮準備、且聞某廠紅成單、又多於所抛之期貨、致業外浮空、祗好逐步抵補、不再觀望、其餘月份、亦因廠家態度又轉鎭定、抛貨見稀、故各月份之開價、又步入堅定、觀前途局面、廠之態度一定、設無意外之衝動、市况當可盤旋過去矣、結果本月份較前日回起一分二厘半、八十一月份好一分半、九十二月份好七厘半、十月份大一分、</p>
<h3>標餅續見上漲</h3>
<p>昨日期餅初開大佳、緣浮空抵補、與客帮暢進、致行情節節向上、竟飛跳三四分、達一兩九錢九分半、較週初最短時竟覆好一錢半之鉅、上落之大殊屬罕有、午後連電到申微平、及一部份多頭了結、致稍回下一分左右、收市開一兩九錢八分、預測本月下期交割必鉅也、</p>
<h3>絲茶歐美囤戸擬囤積期絲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋蔣絲市、似見活動、查歐美絲商因鑒絲價跌至最低限度、現擬乘機囤積、以待綢商之需求、昨歐電雖有轉滬、惜來價漲度甚微、華絲商絲本不數談判尚難就範云、</p>
<h3>雙宫繭價看疲</h3>
<p>今歲雙宫繭自見新以來、歐日銷胃不暢、滬埠雙宫絲廠進意亦淡、開價不振、兹以各絲廠暑假停工、雙宫繭廠不動、祇　日莊稍有購進、昨由原田進無錫雙宫繭八十担、價祗五十兩、價仍看疲云、</p>
<h3>婺源大帮美銷發動</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊綠茶略呈活動之象、婺源大帮、美銷業己發動、開盤自五十五兩五錢至六十兩、惟扯價並不見佳、高莊抽芯珍眉、英莊需要轉濃、屯溪珍眉亦略有走銷、貢熙一項、昨市恊助會業己進行搜辦、華茶商鑒於俄蔣銷路之浩大、産額之歉折、人心一致堅定、不願折價求售云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　月華絨漲起二厘半</h3>
<p>疋頭實銷亦靜、本客均無興奮之象、惟甬帮略形活動、成交中柄月華絨有二百餘件、故價漲起有二厘半、鷄籠·富華·五路·等一致須售一錢八分、金山寺·奇技·楊貴妃·一錢七分七厘半、午</p>
<p>後驟形稀少、大柄月華絨川帮亦有添辦、大鷄籠·楊貴妃俱已須一錢九分矣、餘如棉法絨·彩條絨·藍條絨等、仍無振作之狀、細嗶嘰現貨益多、實球售二錢八分七厘半、湖心亭二錢半、紫金山二錢四分七厘半、印花直貢呢亦己紛紛到滬、形勢己不若以前之俏俐、御花園昨開三錢一分、太陽美人三錢零五厘、秃元秃局現貨仍缺、西貨之放鯉元直貢呢昨長江帮頗有添辦、價爲二錢三分半、上身之德記摇錢樹開六錢九分云、</p>
<h3>糖市神戸糖開出五千包</h3>
<p>粗砂白升至八兩一錢</p>
<p>昨粗砂需要尚活、成交價八兩一錢、二十號中砂白七兩九錢半、十二號荷赤七兩一錢、雖交易不多、市均挺秀、日糖微落、且進出不多、明華ＹＰ嘜八兩二錢二分半、嘜八兩一錢略有成交、ＹＬ嘜作兩○五分、ＹＲＯ嘜七兩九錢二分半、均稀受手、日糖廠盤有三井洋行售開神戸糖五千包、	ＬＭ嘜價五兩九錢、ＴＫ嘜六兩三錢、ＴＸ嘜六兩四錢、均新規加稅、原額計有二萬包、因每包須一兩之證金、因此問津者鮮、號盤有冰花青開出百餘袋、價仍八兩二錢、上海廠冰糖價漲一錢、計仁字嘜十兩○八錢、乾字十兩○六錢、禎祥號售出現貨八號荷赤二千餘袋、價六兩六錢半、比原盤猛升二錢、古巴洋原盤七兩二錢、續有開出、後喊價七兩三錢、尚無成交、炳記號開出三號小吕青二千餘包、價七兩二錢、市形均俏俐、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Great Earthquake in Southern Italy</h3>
<p>The great earthquake in Southern Italy this time is very similar to the earthquake between Tokyo and Yokohama in Japan in the past. The great earthquake in Italy this time caused huge material losses, and there were also many deaths and injuries. The great earthquake in Japan in the past was also the same. As for the national conditions, the similarities between the two countries are also quite a few. One is an emerging country in Asia, and the other is an emerging country in Europe. That is one similarity. Their people are patriotic, strong, and fond of winning, which is the second similarity. One is established on an island, and the other is established on a peninsula, which is the third similarity. They are both located in volcanic zones, which is the fourth similarity. Both are not rich but strong, and gradually trending towards rich countries due to their strength, which is the fifth similarity. Both are the only monarchies in the world, which is the sixth similarity. Both have surplus populations and seek immigrants abroad, which is the seventh similarity. Having these seven similarities and encountering similar great earthquakes, the reason for this is probably not accidental.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the nature, history, and the land where people live are closely related. The various similarities between Japan and Italy are actually due to the people of both countries living in volcanic zones. Because they both live in volcanic zones, the nature and history of their people are similar. Because they both live in volcanic zones, the onslaught of great earthquakes is also similar. Because of the similarity of the great earthquakes, I am reminded of the similarity of their national histories. Can the relationship between mankind and the land they live in be ignored?</p>

<h3>Inland Navigation Rights Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) "The Ministry of Communications has decided on the issue of inland navigation rights, adhering to the spirit of reclaiming sovereignty and absolutely avoiding reciprocity and exchange conditions. Because China's economy is backward and there are very few navigation vessels, it is impossible to develop overseas in the short term. If we reciprocate with other countries, it is tantamount to maintaining the freedom of foreigners to navigate. On the Japanese side, they intend to use reciprocity as an exchange, allowing Chinese ships to navigate and trade in Japanese inland rivers, while British merchants intend to use joint ventures as a condition. These two proposals are inconsistent with our principle of reclamation and cannot be recognized. As for the reclamation of coastal navigation rights, the Ministry of Communications now also stipulates that foreign vessels can only unload cargo when traveling from one Chinese port to another and cannot carry passengers or transport goods. Negotiations with various countries will continue based on this proposal." (Special Dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Severe Earthquake in Italy</h3>
<p>Widespread Disaster Area, Nation Mourns</p>
<p>Over Six Thousand Dead and Injured</p>
<p>More Than Five Thousand Roofs Destroyed</p>
<p>Reuter, Rome, 24th - According to official investigations, yesterday's earthquake in Southern Italy resulted in 1,778 deaths and 4,264 injuries. A total of 3,188 roofs were completely destroyed, and 2,757 were partially destroyed.</p>
<p>Reuter, Naples, Italy, 23rd - Before dawn today, the most severe earthquake this city has ever experienced occurred. It began at 1:10 AM and lasted for 45 seconds. At that time, the streets were deserted, but in an instant, they were filled as residents fled their homes in terror. Some even rushed into churches, asking priests to bring out sacred statues to stop the earthquake. After the first shock, power lines were cut, plunging the night into darkness, and cries of running people filled the air. Those who fled in carriages added to the chaos as they sped through the crowds. The earthquake zone was quite extensive; a famous church in Salerno, built in 1080, was toppled. Fortunately, it was late at night, and no one was injured. According to the latest reports, a total of 276 people have died and 220 have been injured. National News Agency, Rome, 23rd - The entire nation is mourning after the catastrophic earthquake in Southern Italy. The disaster area is vast. The towns of Melfi, Venosa, and Carife have been completely destroyed, and countless houses have collapsed in dozens of other cities and villages. The earthquake's reach even extended to Rome, although the impact on the capital was minor and did not cause any damage. Rescue teams from various locations have rescued 500 injured people and recovered nearly 200 bodies. However, the rescue efforts are severely hampered because transportation to the disaster area is completely blocked, and the land is full of fissures, making roads impassable. The epicenter of the earthquake was near the town of Viciánaca, located 36 kilometers northeast of Naples. The initial shock occurred at around 1 AM this morning and lasted for 46 seconds. It was followed by four more shocks, which seemed less intense. During the earthquake, the ground rumbled like thunder, and lightning flashed across the sky, creating a terrifying scene. In Naples and the affected areas, power lines were cut off, plunging the entire town into darkness. Residents fled to thoroughfares and squares, creating chaotic scenes. As dawn broke, the military and police were deployed to maintain order and guard prisons. The unrest gradually subsided. The exact number of casualties has not yet been confirmed, but the material losses are estimated to be over 200 million lire. The government has ordered officials to encourage residents of the disaster area to recover and face the crisis. Local authorities have also issued warnings that anyone attempting to loot will be executed on the spot, as rumors spread that looting has occurred in various cities and towns, especially in Naples and other places. Naples, a famous city in Southern Italy, has been reduced to a field of rubble. After the earthquake, fires broke out everywhere, but they were difficult to extinguish due to the chaos. However, it is believed that the loss of life will not be too great. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has appointed Senator Cremonesi as the head of disaster relief. He will work with the Red Cross and the Army to quickly organize rescue teams to rush to the disaster area to assist the injured and prevent epidemics.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 23rd - Reports of the number of deaths in the major earthquake in Southern Italy continue to pour in. It is now believed that the total across the region will reach about 1,000. In Melfi alone, 160 bodies have been recovered. In Venosa, it is reported that 300 people are buried in the rubble, and the situation is similar in Avellino. The earthquake's epicenter was beneath the long-dormant Vulture volcano. No houses in that area survived, and over 60,000 people in that region alone are homeless.</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor Receives Memorial from Privy Councilors</h3>
<p>Original Text Forwarded to Prime Minister Hamaguchi</p>
<p>Cabinet Members Advocate Special Response</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - The Emperor, currently at his summer retreat in Hayama, received Marshal Togo yesterday afternoon and accepted the memorial and report from the meeting of the Privy Councilors. Subsequently, Naval Chief of Staff Taniguchi also presented related matters. The Emperor then instructed Military Attaché Nara to deliver the memorial to Prime Minister Hamaguchi. Military Attaché Nara met with the Prime Minister at his official residence at 8 PM last night, allowing him to review the memorial. This follows the precedent set by the Washington Conference. While Prime Minister Hamaguchi considered a brief review sufficient, some cabinet members argued that the current situation differs from the previous one and necessitates a special response from Prime Minister Hamaguchi. Although the military strength, armaments, and operational capabilities may not be sufficient, in light of world peace and reducing the burden on the people, and considering the public opinion responsible for signing the naval disarmament treaty, it is necessary to fully supplement the deficiencies within the scope of not undermining the financial foundation to ensure national defense. Many support a response to the Emperor along these lines. Given the gravity of the matter, the government plans to discuss it at tomorrow's regular cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - The government's stance toward the Privy Council is to absolutely avoid backroom maneuvering and resolutely demand the Privy Council's understanding through a fair and upright response. The general direction of the defense is as follows: Firstly, the decision to send instructions to the plenipotentiary delegation in London did not disregard the opinions of the military. Therefore, accusations regarding the supreme command authority cannot be accepted. The details of this matter will be explained in detail by Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who was the Acting Navy Minister at the time. Secondly, discussions regarding military strength are highly confidential and of utmost importance. Finance Minister and Navy Minister Zaibu will provide explanations within the scope of not causing obstacles.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - The Privy Council's special investigation committee on the London Treaty will be appointed in the next two to three days. The most likely candidates for the list include Count Ito Miyoji, Baron Kaneko Kentaro, Viscount Ishii Kikujiro, Viscount Ishiguro Tadanori, Baron Tomii Masaakira, Baron/Viscount/Earl???  Tate Kenjiro, Mr. Eki Kazuyoshi, General Kawai Osamu, and Kamada Eikichi. Count Ito Miyoji is considered the most likely candidate for chairman. There is speculation that Privy Council Vice President Hiranuma Kiichiro may participate. If this happens, he will naturally be in a position to oppose the government.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - Prime Minister Hamaguchi departed from Tokyo Station at 9:30 AM today and arrived at the Hayama Imperial Villa at 10:40 AM. He was granted an audience with the Emperor, presented the contents of the naval disarmament treaty and other matters, and spent approximately 30 minutes. He then requested consultation with the Privy Council and temporarily withdrew. Afterwards, he was joined by Ministers Matsuda, Tanabe, and others for an audience with the Emperor and Empress Dowager, and they had lunch together. He departed at 1:40 PM and took the 2:00 PM train back to Tokyo.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Describes Situation in Egypt</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - Today, Foreign Secretary Henderson reported to the House of Commons about the disturbances in Cairo on Monday, stating that 15 demonstrations occurred, each involving 300 to 400 people. Demonstrators threw stones at tram windows and streetlights, but there was no damage to European property. Only one tram ticket conductor and one Austrian were injured among the Europeans. The situation in Cairo is gradually stabilizing. British troops have not been deployed. Disturbances have also occurred in Port Said and Suez, but British troops have not been used there either. Workers are complying with the ban on work and have not participated in the demonstrations.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Cairo, 23rd - The Egyptian King's refusal of the Wafd Party's request to immediately convene a special session of parliament was largely based on the cabinet's opinion that such a gathering would violate the constitution. Political circles fear that this move will reignite popular unrest and lead to severe political disputes. The Wafd Party will certainly not accept this decision by the King and the cabinet without a struggle.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Recent Situation in Prison</h3>
<p>Reuter, Pune, 23rd - Jayakar and Sapru entered Yerwada Jail today to see Gandhi and talked for four hours before leaving. Afterwards, the two declined to meet with visitors. Judging by Sapru's expression, the conversation seemed satisfactory. They later met with Mrs. Naidu, a leader of the Indian National Congress, in prison. They will see Gandhi again tomorrow to urge him to restore peace in India.</p>
<p>Reuter, Pune, 24th - Gandhi entrusted Sapru and Jayakar with handwritten messages to be delivered to Nehru and his son. Therefore, Sapru and Jayakar are now going to Allahabad to visit Nehru in prison.</p>
<h3>Division of the German National People's Party</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - The German National People's Party, originally a combination of nationalistic and conservative factions, has now split today. The left-wing elements who recently supported the Brüning cabinet in the Reichstag have formed a new party with members who had previously left the party, calling it the Conservative National People's Party. Therefore, the original German National People's Party has now split into three: First, the National People's Party still under the banner of Hugenberg; second, the newly formed Conservative National People's Party; and third, agricultural members who have broken away from Hugenberg. In the upcoming general election, they will independently fight the election with a focus on agricultural policies.</p>

<h3>Spain Sets New Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Reuter, Madrid, 23rd - Today's official gazette disclosed new tax rates, which can be seen as Spain's response to the new U.S. tariffs. According to official sources, the new Spanish tax rates are not retaliatory and are not specifically aimed at the United States. However, the intention behind the tax increases is evident in the goods targeted. The taxed goods include American-imported cars, tires, films, motors, bicycles, and rayon. The Spanish government claims that it wants to encourage domestic industries, but many believe that the new tax rates will not benefit Spanish industries and will instead increase the cost of living.</p>
<h3>German President Ends Vacation and Returns to Berlin</h3>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 23rd - German President Hindenburg returned to Berlin today due to the tragic accident in Koblenz yesterday, where a pontoon bridge collapsed, causing many deaths. The German President decided to end his vacation and return to the capital.</p>
<h3>Flooding from Heavy Rains on River Ouse</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - Heavy rains have caused flooding in the River Ouse basin in Yorkshire, England. Roads have been flooded, and many houses have been destroyed. River patrol boats have entered the inner harbor to rescue flood victims. The main water pipe in the town of Whitby has burst, and the town only has enough drinking water for two days. Many railway bridges have also been destroyed, and telephone lines in the affected areas are down. The number of deaths is feared to be high.</p>
<h3>European Air Race Continues</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - The European air race continues today with British pilot Mr. Butler still in the lead. This morning, he was the first to arrive in Seville, then turned back to Madrid, and is now flying to Barcelona. After passing that city, he will go to Lyon, Vienna, Königsberg, and then return to the finish line in Berlin. Mr. Swann, also British, is close behind.</p>
<h3>Investigation of British Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - In the case of the plane that crashed in Kent while returning from France, killing six people, the coroner examined the bodies today. It was found that in addition to the two pilots, there were four dead passengers: the Marchioness of Dufferin, Sir Ward, the Viscountess of Erleigh, and Mrs. Loffler, a British socialite. Aviation experts are currently investigating the cause of the accident, and the verdict is expected to be announced on August 13th.</p>
<h3>Death of Airplane Inventor</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Florida, 23rd - Mr. Curtiss, the world-renowned airplane inventor, died today due to pulmonary contraction caused by an appendectomy. Curtiss was born in 1878. From a young age, he was dedicated to studying engines. In 1902, he opened a motorcycle factory in his hometown. Curtiss followed the successful methods of automobile magnate Ford, using himself as an example to demonstrate the excellence of his factory's products. He continuously set new competition records riding motorcycles produced in his factory in 1905 and 1907. His final record was one mile in just 46 and one-fifth seconds. Later, he became interested in airplanes and diligently explored airplane manufacturing methods. The engine used in Captain Baldwin's airplane was uniquely built by Curtiss. The first airplane engine approved for use by the U.S. government was also Curtiss's invention. Curtiss then flew his self-made airplanes and engines, winning numerous world airplane competition championships. In the American International Aviation Competition held in August 1909, he won the French Gordon Bennett Cup. In 19010, he won the first prize of $19,000 from the New York World. The awards and honors he received from various countries afterwards are too numerous to count. His sudden death at a time when he could have accomplished so much is deeply regretted by the aviation world.</p>

<h3>Guizhou Province War Situation Urgent</h3>
<p>Guizhou Army's Recent Retreat to Liuzhou Defense Plan</p>
<p>The 48th Route Army will enter Guilin and Pingle</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: After the Guizhou army's Li Zongren and Huang Shaoxiong's departments retreated from Guilin, they have now concentrated their main force in Liuzhou. Because Liuzhou is a key stronghold in the northwest of Guizhou, it can control Yongyuan (i.e., Nanning) to the south and connect to Pingle and Guilin to the north, forming a strategic triangle. It can resist the Guangdong army going west along the Fu River. Moreover, since the outbreak of wars in Guizhou Province, all the armaments manufacturing plants in Xunzhou and Nanning have been moved to Liuzhou. And Liuzhou Qingyuan borders the Yunnan-Guizhou border, and there is ample room for replenishment and training of soldiers. Therefore, recently Li Zongren has established the 7th Army Headquarters in the old Daoyin Office in Maping (i.e., Liuzhou City). Bai Chongxi is currently arranging defensive works in the front line of Liuzhou, such as Luorong, Luzhai, and Huangmianxu, as a defensive line after giving up Guilin. Huang Shaoxiong is responsible for the route from Liuzhou to Xiangzhou, Laibin, and Nanning. Li Zongren has also recently levied 5 million catties of military rice from rice merchants in Liuzhou to enrich the rations. Only the newly編軍 troops are left in Guilin and Pingle for defense. Guilin has about 1,000 newly編軍 troops reorganized from the militia, and Pingle has about 1,100 men under Zhou Guozhi, etc. Recently, because the Yunnan army entering Guizhou Province is approaching Yongyuan from Taiping, the main force of Huang Xuchu's department has been transferred to Nanning to cooperate with Wei Yunsong's department to resist. This is the recent situation of the Guizhou army retreating to Liuzhou for defense. At present, the central armies have detected the actions of the Guizhou army and intend to quickly pursue and attack in separate routes while they are unprepared for deployment. In addition to the 4th Route Army He Jianjian's Liu and Li divisions besieging Guilin, the 8th Route Army is divided into two routes, one entering Longhuguan from the Hunan border, exiting Gongcheng Shazijie, and attacking Pingle. This route is the Huang Yanzhen brigade of Li Yangjing's department, and the Huang Renhuan department of the Teaching Brigade. The Huang brigade's regiments had concentrated in Gongcheng on the 18th. Gongcheng is only 80 li away from Pingle. It is expected that it will reach Pingle on the 19th. As for the 59th Division Yu Hanmou's department, it has taken the road of Mengshan in the past few days, crossed the southern border of Pingle, and the Li and Ye brigades have opened to Lipu (Lipu is 80 li south of Pingle) in order to sandwich the 8th Route Army on the Gongcheng side. When the general attack order is issued, the 8th Route Army can take Pingle in one go, because the Guizhou army stationed there has only 1,100 men under Zhou Guozhi, and no reinforcements have been seen arriving in recent days. It is rumored that the Guizhou army abandoned Guilin and Pingle, which is not without reason. It is heard that the 8th Route Army took advantage of the attack on Pingle Guilin and transferred the 62nd Division Gong Jianxiong's department and the Artillery Regiment Zhou Jingzhen's department to raid Liuzhou, the enemy's base, from a certain road. As for the attack on Nanning, it is undertaken by the Yunnan army Lu Han's department. It is heard that Zhang Chong's division of the Lu department has passed Taipingfu. After three or four days of journey, it will be approaching Nanning. Wei Yunsong, the Guizhou army guarding Yongyuan, has telegraphed Huang Shaoxiong for help. Huang immediately ordered Huang Xuchu's department's Huang Jian and Huang Xing regiments to rush to Yongyuan. It is expected that wars will inevitably occur in Shipugenzhu and other places near Nanning. (July 19)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Changes to Issuing 15 Million Financial Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Approved by the Provincial Government Meeting for Issuance on August 1st</p>
<p>Promotion Procedures are Divided into Allotment and Combination Sales</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Guangdong Province plans to issue 15 million yuan of the 19th year rehabilitation treasury bonds. The issuance regulations were resolved and amended at the Provincial Administrative Conference on the 15th, changing the name of the rehabilitation treasury bonds to Guangdong Consolidation Financial Treasury Bonds. The date is set for issuance on August 1st, and the original weekly interest rate of 8% is changed to a weekly interest rate of 1%. All other articles will be handled in accordance with the original plan. In recent days, the Finance Department has been actively preparing for the issuance. It is found that its promotion methods are divided into allotment and combination sales. (1) Allotment method: Each county is allotted to wealthy people, and shops in cities such as Guangzhou, Haikou, Shantou, Foshan, and Jiangmen are levied at 2% of the registered capital of the business license. For shops in Guangzhou and Shantou, they will be levied again at one month's rent, which will be borne by the owner. The Li tax donation contractors affiliated to the Finance Department will sell according to half a month's amount of their salary. (2) Combination sales method: Both national and provincial taxes, and the li tax donation agencies and commissioned agencies in each county and city, for taxpayers, sell 20% of the tax amount in combination (because of the case of maintaining the financial taxes and donations, an additional 10% will be requested separately), 20% of the fines from all administrative and judicial agencies in the province will be sold in combination, and 20% of the monthly expenses of all administrative and judicial agencies in the province will be sold in combination according to the monthly budget amount. Based on the above promotion, if it can be promoted without obstruction, the issuance of 15 million yuan of bonds in the entire province is not difficult. However, the large amount of financial bonds issued this time is the first of all bond issuances by the government. In the government's original intention, the debts owed by the government to merchants in recent years have not been fully repaid, and the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes issued by the Central Bank have not yet been restored. If you want to clear the previous debts and maintain the Central Bank banknotes, it is not easy to have more than 10 million yuan, so it is better to sell this huge amount of financial bonds at once. Also, the Finance Department once held a financial loan last year, and the Guangzhou Silver Industry Bank was ordered to take an additional 20% of public bonds. Now that the financial bonds are about to be issued, the Finance Department will give priority to returning the 20% of public bonds sold by the Silver Industry Bank last year to show credit. It is found that the financial loan of more than 2,655,000 yuan recognized by the Silver Industry Bank last year, calculated according to the original amount, is more than 584,000 yuan of 20% of public bonds. The principal and interest are included. This number has been sent by the Finance Department to the Central Bank to extract the roll for detailed investigation. After the Finance Department's review and approval, the principal and interest of the 20% of public bonds will be paid with military treasury bonds within days and handed over to the banking industry to distribute to various banks for collection.

<h3>He Jian Executes Guizhou Army Division Commander by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Lan Tian was arrested in Changsha for inciting troops</p>
<p>Jing Siyou is detained at the 4th Route Army Headquarters</p>
<p>Changsha newsletter: Lan Tian, the teacher of the training division under Li Zongren of the Guizhou Army and a native of Hunan, has served as a regiment and battalion commander in the military circles of Hunan Province. When Li Zongren retreated from Changsha, he ordered him to concentrate his old troops in Baoqing Qiyang and other places to await orders. Lan gathered more than 1,000 bandits in Qiyang, with more than 700 guns, and hid in the countryside, waiting for the opportunity to move. He personally came to Changsha to incite troops. Tang Gongjian, the battalion commander of Wang Xianyi's department of the 15th Division's Training Regiment, had worked with Lan for many years. When he was incited by Tang, he appointed Tang as the regiment commander and ordered the troops to open to the Qi Bao area to assemble. As long as they left Changsha for 30 miles, they would first issue a salary. Tang Gongjian was unmoved and secretly reported to the Changsha Garrison Commander and 15th Division Commander Wei Suzhong, who sent a team to capture Lan. After questioning the situation, it was deemed that the case was of great importance and was submitted to the Fourth Route Commander's Office for review. He Jian personally interviewed him once. According to his confession, he is currently a Guizhou army division commander. He is collecting guns and inciting troops in the Chang Bao Qi Yong area. After Lan was arrested, there were many old acquaintances in the military circles of Hunan Province, who asked to spare him a death. He Jian said that Lan's secret incitement of troops was intolerable by law, so he resolutely shot him outside Liuyangmen at noon on the 19th. The body was collected by his family in a high-quality coffin. For Tang Gongjian, who was not incited, the rank of regimental commander was retained and he was given priority for promotion. He Jian also announced Lan's crimes as follows: "For the announcement of crimes, the case was submitted by the Provincial Garrison Headquarters to the Ministry for the handling of the important criminal Lan Tian who incited the troops. After repeated research and questioning, it was learned that the criminal was commissioned by the pseudo-order of the Gui rebel Li Zongren to sneak into the provincial capital, hoping to incite the army. He happened to meet his old colleague Tang Gongjian, the current training regiment battalion commander. He invited him to</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>He told him about his current position as the pseudo-division commander of the Guizhou Army, and that he had moved the giant bandit Wang Yin in Qiyang and had more than 700 guns. He had already matured and told Battalion Commander Tang to bring the troops to 30 miles away from the city, and there would be a way, etc. The battalion commander reported it to the garrison headquarters and took him to the ministry for questioning. After being summoned by this headquarters, the criminal bowed his head and said nothing. It seems that inciting the army and counter-attacking are obvious. It is really unforgivable to be guilty, and he should be sentenced to death according to law to show his strict warning. In addition to monitoring the arrest of the Lan Tian name, verifying his identity, and tying him to the execution ground to carry out the shooting, he should announce the crimes to inform the public. This cloth."</p>
<p>In addition, Jing Siyou, a member of the War Zone Political Affairs Committee and special envoy to western Hunan, is also among the important figures of the Guizhou family who have been arrested and detained. When He Yingqin was in Hunan, he was once brought to the camp to be shot, but he was spared because someone interceded. Jing is still detained at the Fourth Route Commander's Office. As for He Jian himself, he has no intention of killing Jing, but I don't know if he can escape. (July 20)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Suppression of Bandits in the Entire Province of Liaoning</h3>
<p>Five Bandit Suppression Commanders Have Been Appointed</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Recently, banditry in our province has become increasingly rampant. They openly appear and disappear in key provincial defense areas and near railways, treating the military as if it were nothing. The military, in turn, is struggling to defend against them and unable to eliminate them. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast, Zhang Xueliang, has specially appointed five bandit suppression commanders to conduct a thorough search and suppression. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to eliminate them. Excerpts of the bandit suppression measures are as follows: (1) Now that the green crops are growing tall, bandits in various parts of Liaoning are once again stirring, thinking of making trouble. In order to prevent this in advance and prevent future troubles, it is proposed to divide areas according to the situation in Liaoning Province, assign the commanders of the local garrisons to supervise their troops to strictly suppress and deal with the bandits, in order to eliminate the bandit scourge in one fell swoop. (2) Now, based on the overall situation in Liaoning Province and the situation of the garrisons in various places, the areas are divided as follows: 1. The First Bandit Suppression Area includes all counties east of the South Manchurian Railway line: Changbai, Fusong, Antu, Linjiang, Tonghua, Huinan, Hailong, Liuhe, Jinchuan, Xi'an, Dongfeng, Xifeng, Qingyuan, Xinbin, Huanren, Ji'an, Fushun, Benxi, Gaiping, Fuxian, Zhuanghe, Xiuyan, Andong, Fengcheng, Kuandian, etc. 2. The Second Bandit Suppression Area includes all counties between the South Manchurian Railway and the Beining-Gouying Railway line: Liaozhong, Tai'an, Panshan, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Haicheng, Shenyang, etc., that is, the area within the South Manchurian Railway and the Beining Railway, between Shenyang and Shishan Station, and the area on both sides of the Gouying branch railway line. 3. The Third Bandit Suppression Area includes all counties along the Jin-Chao Railway line west of Shishan Station on the Beining Railway line: Jin County, Yi County, Jinxi, Xingcheng, Suizhong, etc., that is, the area between Shishan Station and Shanhaiguan on the Beining Railway line. 4. The Fourth Bandit Suppression Area includes all counties on both sides of the Datong Railway line north of the Beining Railway line between Shenyang and Shishan Station: Beizhen, Heishan, Xinmin, Zhangwu, Tongliao (southern part), Faku, Kangping, Changtu, Kaiyuan, Tieling, etc. All areas above the Beining Railway line and the Datong Railway line between Shenyang and Shishan Station shall be the responsibility of this area. 5. The Fifth Bandit Suppression Area includes the area north of the Siping-Tongliao Railway line: Liaoyuan, Taonan, Kaitong, Zhendong, Anguang, Tuquan, Tongliao (north of the county seat), Zhanyu, Lishu, Huaide, Shuangshan, etc. However, all areas along the Tongliao-Sipingjie railway line and the area north of the line are the responsibility of this area. (3) Regulations on the Commanders of Bandit Suppression: The bandit suppression commander of the First Area shall be concurrently held by Yu Zhishan, the Border Defense Commissioner of Eastern Liaoning. The bandit suppression commander of the Second Area shall be concurrently held by Sun Dequan, the brigade commander of the 19th Brigade. The bandit suppression commander of the Third Area shall be concurrently held by Zhang Tingshu, the brigade commander of the 12th Brigade. The bandit suppression commander of the Fourth Area shall be concurrently held by Ding Xichun, the brigade commander of the 2nd Brigade. The bandit suppression commander of the Fifth Area shall be concurrently held by Zhang Haipeng, the Border Defense Commissioner of Taoliao. (4) For the infantry and cavalry units of the garrisons in each bandit suppression area, except for the deployment of forces of one battalion (or one cavalry company) or more, the bandit suppression commander of each area must first telegraph for approval. If encountering a large number of bandits, the bandit suppression commander of each area is allowed to deploy troops below one battalion (or one cavalry company) at any time. All deployed troops must strictly obey the orders of the bandit suppression commander of each area. However, the bandit suppression commander of each area should consult with the commander of the relevant troops in advance when deploying the garrison troops in his area. Only one regiment is allowed to be used as a bandit suppression force, which the commander can deploy at any time in accordance with the aforementioned regulations. The rest must remain in their defense area for normal education and training. (5) Regulations on Bandit Suppression Matters: All directly subordinate troops of the bandit suppression commanders and the troops temporarily deployed by the bandit suppression commanders in each area shall have separate measures formulated and promulgated for the supply of provisions and firewood during bandit suppression operations, in order to show consideration. The bandit suppression commander of each area and the commander of the relevant troops shall report the number of officers and soldiers and the dates of departure at any time for verification and issuance. No disturbance of merchants and residents is allowed. If discovered or reported by merchants and residents, they will be severely punished. 2. During the bandit suppression period, the headquarters will temporarily dispatch a military judge to each bandit suppression commander's headquarters to be stationed permanently, and will form a military law office with the military law personnel of the department to handle banditry cases at any time. 3. Police, militia, and other local security teams in each bandit suppression area should do their best to assist the army in bandit suppression matters and strictly obey the dispatch of the bandit suppression commander. All bandits captured by the police, militia, and other local security teams shall be handed over to the bandit suppression commander for handling. However, the bandit suppression commander should treat the police, militia, and other local security teams equally, and rewards and punishments must be clear. As for the dangerous mountain passes, local customs, and habits, the location of bandit dens, and the roads they disturb, the police, militia, and other local security teams should report in detail to provide information for the bandit suppression commanders to plan. 4. If the bandit suppression troops need to pass through the South Manchurian Railway line due to circumstances, if time permits, the bandit suppression commander should telegraph the nearby county government to inform it of the location of passage. The county government should immediately notify the local Japanese authorities. Otherwise, the commanding officer should temporarily notify the local Japanese authorities in coordination with the local police to avoid misunderstandings between the two sides. 5. The scheduled period for bandit suppression is from now until the end of October, and the suppression and capture must be completed within four months. At that time, rewards and punishments will be given based on the results of the bandit suppression.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The County Government Convenes a Meeting to Distribute Expenses for Collecting Additional Taxes: Yesterday (the 23rd) morning, the County Government convened a meeting of the four bureau chiefs, the Asset Management Office of the County Reorganization Committee, the County Chamber of Commerce, etc., to discuss how to allocate funds for the additional land tax collection, universal education expenses, and district project expenses as ordered. County Magistrate Jin presided over the meeting and explained the situation. After mutual discussion, it was decided that due to the poor autumn harvest last year and the people's inability to pay, coupled with the busy season of the 19th year, the collection of taxes was already rushed and could not be completed in time. All the remaining amount of 1% of the land price should be used to allocate 2.4% for universal education land tax and 1.2% for district project land tax, and the County should submit a request for additional collection before the start of the busy season of the 20th year. The County Court is Scheduled to be Established: The preparations for the establishment of the County Court in this county have been completed.

<p>A Wife Killed for One Yuan: A certain A, a farmer from Tailaiqiao Township in the county, is from a well-to-do family. The day before yesterday (the 22nd), a neighbor returned a loan of one yuan to A's wife. She happened to be dressing up, so she placed it on the table. Unexpectedly, the yuan suddenly disappeared. She told her husband and suspected that the hired worker had stolen it. However, her husband said that the hired worker was always honest and that she must have secretly pocketed it herself, accusing others to cover up her own misdeeds. The wife felt that her husband had wronged her for what she had hidden and was very unwilling. As a result, they started arguing with each other. Her husband suddenly took a rope and a kitchen knife and said to his wife, "Do you want to die by knife or by rope?" The wife thought that her husband was just making empty threats and was not afraid. They continued to argue as before. Her husband suddenly held the knife and asked his wife's neck and violently chopped five or six times, causing her head to be separated from her body, which was a tragic sight. It is not known how this tragic case will end. Zhang Shuchun Redeems His Daughter from Entanglement: Zhang Shuchun, who lives in Zhangyan Town in the county, has been doing business outside for many years and has not returned. His wife, Chen, could not bear to live alone. In July last year, she sold her two daughters separately to a certain family in the city as adopted daughters, obtaining tens of yuan in dowry money. She also sold all the items in the house and fled to another place. This summer, Zhang returned home to visit and found that everything was gone. Later, he learned that his two daughters had been sold in the city. The eldest daughter was mediated by relatives and became the adopted daughter-in-law of a certain family, still recognizing Zhang as her biological father. The buyer of the youngest daughter, Chen, was unwilling to cooperate, so Zhang petitioned the County Party Department for assistance. It is now known that the County Party Department has mediated and Zhang has repaid 40 yuan in dowry money and 35 yuan for 11 months of food expenses. The daughter will be taken back by Zhang to reunite the family.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Two Small Steamers in Dongshan Robbed and Seized by Bandits in Wangjiadang: There are four small steamers between Suzhou and Dongshan, carrying goods and passengers back and forth. Yesterday (the 24th) morning, the Dalu Steamer left Dongshan at about 6:00 AM with passengers. The Feihu Steamer left the mountain at about 7:00 AM. In addition to carrying 17 passengers, the Dalu Steamer also carried Wang Wusheng, the captain of the 8th Detachment of the 2nd District of the Provincial Public Security Bureau of Dongshan, who was traveling to Suzhou on official business, along with two orderlies, who were riding in the tugboat. A pioneer boat of the detachment, with more than ten water police officers and more than twenty rifles, was attached to the rear of the tugboat. The Feihu carried more than 30 passengers. At about 7:30 AM, when the Dalu Steamer arrived near the ferry crossing of Wangyewan Tingzigang behind Hengjingdu Village, gunshots were suddenly heard from all directions. There were more than a dozen bandits on the north bank of the mulberry fields, firing fifty or sixty shots and ordering the steamer to stop. After the steamer stopped, the bandits blew bugles and police whistles, and more than forty small "grass-flying" boats sailed out from various ports and tributaries connected to Taihu Lake and surrounded the steamer. They boarded the steamer and searched and robbed it. Fourteen passengers on the steamer, including three women and children, were kidnapped, and their luggage and belongings were looted. Only the accountant, Ren Weirong, and a passenger in his thirties, carrying a package and an umbrella, took the opportunity to escape. In addition, a poor old woman was not kidnapped. When Captain Wang saw the bandits coming to rob, he ordered the water police to open fire. However, due to being outnumbered, they were disarmed after firing two shots, and the water police were all kidnapped. The sailors on the steamer and Captain Wang all jumped into the river to avoid capture. Later, the bandits ordered everyone to come ashore. At that time, Captain Wang was wearing short clothes and pretended to be a merchant. Three bandits recognized Wang and each monitored him with a pistol, kidnapping Wang together. His two orderlies were dragged to the mulberry fields and shot on the spot. The bandits numbered more than two hundred and were a combination of the Henan, Jiangbei, and Pudong gangs. Most of their weapons were pistols. At about 8:00 AM, the Feihu Steamer arrived. Because they saw that the bandits were mostly wearing gray military uniforms, they did not suspect anything. When they approached, they were also robbed. As a result, the accountant, Yu Bokang (Yu Wugong's nephew), was kidnapped, along with a tugboat and more than 30 passengers. The boatman, Qin Lingsheng, was shot in the right wrist by a bandit bullet while propping the pole at the bow of the boat. The steamer's machinery was also damaged. When the bandits robbed the steamer, they also fired fifty or sixty shots. Afterwards, the Feihu tugboat was released empty and both steamers came to the city in the afternoon. The injured Qin Lingsheng was treated at the Bo Xi Hospital. The Chairman of Suzhou Province, Ye Chucang, happened to be in the city for the funeral of Tao Xiaozhi, the director of the Property Management Office. After County Magistrate Huang personally reported the details of the steamer robbery and the kidnapping of the police, Ye ordered Huang to inform the 2nd District of Wuxi, and District Chief Mao Mujun immediately led the Bao Su, Zhao Wu, and Hong Ping warships to Dongshan upon receiving the report. He made an appointment with District Chief Gong to lead a team to Dongshan and decided to hold a meeting today (the 25th) to discuss the pursuit and suppression of the bandits.</p>

He used to work as an accountant at the Gongbei Lou teahouse and as an advertising salesman for the Da Gong Bao. He is now unemployed at home and is in dire financial straits. He suddenly had the thought of ending his life. At 9:00 PM the night before last, he purchased and consumed a large amount of anti-smoking medicine in an attempt to commit suicide. Yesterday morning, his family noticed that Jiang's face was different and that he was unconscious. They rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. His life is not in danger.

When they did not obtain any silver dollars, they kidnapped Zhang's grandson, Qiancheng, and instructed him to send the silver funds to Qinglongqiao outside the North Gate within three days for redemption. Unexpectedly, the bandits took the hostage to the Licheng Township area of ​​Jiangyin County. Due to careless supervision, Zhang Qiancheng took the opportunity to escape. He escaped danger and returned home on the 22nd. Afterwards, the local public security sub-bureau reported the case to the general bureau in the city and requested assistance in arresting the perpetrators.</p>

Instead, three militiamen were injured and a total of six rifles and box cannons were seized. Two militiamen were pushed into the river. The police and militia had no choice but to fire warning shots, killing two villagers on the spot. The rest scattered. It is reported that bandits have been hiding in the township for a long time and used the resistance to tax payment to rally the villagers.

<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>朱金涛家三票被绑 Three Tickets Kidnapped from Zhu Jintao's Family: Zhu Jintao of Lizedong Township is from a well-to-do family and has been coveted by bandits. Last night, seven bandits suddenly came and forcibly took Zhu's cousin, Afu Sheng, his wife, Fang, and his daughter, Ming Nun, from the courtyard. They demanded a ransom of 1,000 yuan for each ticket and forbade them from reporting to the authorities. 房捐经征员携欵潜逃 Housing Tax Collector Flees with Funds: Jin Zengzhi, the housing tax collector of the County Government, is from Jiaxing and has lived in this county for many years. When Magistrate Shen summoned the employee to settle accounts the other day because he was handling the closing, he could not find him anywhere. He sent someone to check the files and discovered that the employee owed more than 1,600 yuan in taxes. Therefore, the guarantor of the employee, Kang Zhimou, was called to the government for surveillance and ordered to pay off the public funds.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>被劫商号电请缉盗 Robbed Businesses Telegraph for Arrest of Thieves: The Caozhuang Town, more than ten miles outside the east city of Jiaxing, was robbed by forty or fifty bandits on the 19th. Twenty-six businesses and households were looted, losing more than 20,000 yuan, and many people were shot and injured on the spot. It is now known that the robbed businesses have been unable to maintain their business. Although County Magistrate Jiang and Public Security Bureau Chief Mo advised the businesses to continue operating as usual when they went to the town for on-site inspection, the businesses were short of funds and suffered from this robbery, making it difficult to recover. Although they are still open, they have no goods to meet the needs of customers. It is now known that the robbed businesses and households in the town, Wang Yusheng, Zhang Yongsheng, and twenty-six others, jointly telegraphed the province the other day, requesting the prompt issuance of orders to the water and land police to strictly arrest the thieves in order to comfort the merchants. 县府秘书控告商号 County Government Secretary Accuses Businesses: Fang Zhuangyou, the secretary of the Jiaxing County Government, was acting as the county magistrate on the 14th and 15th of last month. At that time, the County Public Security Bureau violated orders and conscripted laborers. At that time, various civil groups believed that this conscription of laborers had a significant impact on commerce and sent many representatives to visit Secretary Fang. Fang was irresponsible and said that laborers were needed and that conscription was necessary. Therefore, various civil groups telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang and the Department of Civil Affairs of the Provincial Government, requesting investigation and handling. Commander-in-Chief Jiang then telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to conduct a thorough investigation. At that time, more than 200 businesses in Jiaxing also jointly submitted a petition to the province, requesting the dismissal of Secretary Fang and Public Security Bureau Chief Mo for investigation. At the same time, representatives of civil groups petitioned the province, demanding the removal of Fang and Mo. Recently, Fang Zhuangyou filed a complaint with the Jiaxing Local Branch Court, accusing the businesses of false accusations. After the court accepted the case, the prosecutor's office summoned the plaintiffs and defendants on the 23rd for a hearing. After this case occurred, the people in Hezhong believed that officials accusing the people was a novel occurrence, and that it was an undeniable fact of conscription of laborers, so they would never bear the responsibility of false accusations.</p>

This time, with the introduction of a friend, he was reappointed as an enlistment committee member. A group of hooligans and thugs were deeply afraid of suffering the same fate, so yesterday at midnight, they gathered more than 20 people, armed with awls, etc., and went to Ruan Kehong to intercept and injure Ruan with more than 20 knives. They dragged him to the nearby Lion Mountain and dug out both of Ruan's eyes. Dong Abao and Zhu Mingliang, colleagues at the enlistment office, saw the thugs entering the office with a fierce momentum and fled into the back mountain. Except for Dong, who suffered minor knife wounds, Zhu was fortunate enough to escape unharmed.</p>

<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Suppressing Wandering Bandit Gangs in Shuxian County. It is reported that bandit gangs wander erratically near the border of Hefei and Shu counties. Some days ago, a gang of over 400 bandits, led by Huang Quande, marauded into the town of Meihe in Shuxian County, intending to loot and pillage. The town's Captain Wang led a large team of local militia to confront them, thwarting their aims. The bandits then burned down dozens of houses outside the town and retreated to Zhangmu Bridge. The magistrate of Shuxian County, Yang Yanshou, upon hearing the alarm, led the police force to suppress them, attacking from both sides. The bandits then fled to the town of Guanting, located at the junction of Hefei and Liu'an counties, where they defended the town fiercely. The Shuxian police pursued them and occupied the hilltops, using mortars to bombard the town. After a day of stalemate, the bandits eventually broke through the siege and fled into the deep mountains. In this engagement, three bandit leaders were killed, over thirty bandits were wounded, and over sixty were injured. Twelve kidnapped hostages were rescued. Magistrate Yang has already led his team back to Shu county.</p>
<p>Methods for Adding Soldiers and Purchasing Weapons for Self-Defense. The Hefei City and Township Public Security Association, due to the frequent attempts by bandit gangs to directly attack the county seat, and the existing three self-defense teams being insufficient for defense and suppression, resolved to recruit an additional 240 militiamen, purchase weapons in accordance with the number, and expand their strength. They have entrusted Liu Wenming, the Deputy Director of the Provincial Security Office, to order weapons from Shanghai, estimated to cost 30,000 yuan, and have sent a telegram urging payment. The Association is now discussing the matter and has decided that these expenses will be covered by a proportional levy on the residents and shops inside and outside the city.</p>

<h3>The China Expeditionary Football Team Achieves a Victorious Start</h3>
<p>Defeats the Malayan Chinese Federation Two to One</p>
<p>Center Forward Dai Linjing Scores Twice</p>
<p>Feng Wenxun of the Chinese Federation Scores One Goal</p>
<p>(Singapore, July 13th Dispatch) The China Expeditionary Football Team, composed of the nation's elite players, today (July 13th) played its first expedition match against the Malayan Chinese Federation football team at the Jalan Besar Stadium in Singapore. With a thunderous roar, they achieved a victorious start, winning two to one, which seems to foreshadow future success.</p>
<h3>Huge Crowds of Spectators</h3>
<p>The weather was very good on this day. Local spectators, awed by the reputation of the expeditionary team, were eager to witness the event. As the bells rang four times, the spectators surged in like a tide, bringing the old and young, an endless stream. The field was packed with people, and the surroundings were full, estimated to be over ten thousand people.</p>
<h3>Key Players of the Chinese Federation Absent</h3>
<p>The strength of the Chinese Federation is usually very strong, and even with the full strength of South China, they have been defeated. However, three key players were absent this time because the Selangor team held its annual Silver Cup competition against the Gemas team the day before. Therefore, the players could not participate in this match within a short period. The absence of the three key players should have had a significant impact on the team's overall strength.</p>
<h3>Two Goalkeepers Show Their Skills</h3>
<p>At five o'clock, the Western referee gathered both sides for a photo and coin toss. China took the south side, and the Federation team took the north side. The Federation team kicked off first. As the ball spun, it was kicked into the Federation team's territory by Li Huitang, the left inside forward of the China team. The Federation team's defense was unprepared, and the ball suddenly flew in front of the goal. Fortunately, goalkeeper Yang Yaji's eyes were sharp and his hands were quick, catching the ball but then fumbling it. At the critical moment, Yaji used his agile skills to defuse the danger. Afterward, the Federation team still could not kick the ball out of their territory and was shot at twice by the China team, both times caught by Yaji. Soon, the China team committed a foul, and the Federation team took the opportunity to attack the China team's territory. In the critical moment, right back Feng Yunyou rescued the situation for the China team. The China team took the opportunity to counterattack, and the ball rolled into the Federation team's territory. The China team suddenly went offside, but the Federation team still could not gain momentum to kick the ball out of the line. They were under pressure again and committed a left corner kick. Fortunately, the shot was inaccurate, and they were able to escape the danger and counterattack, forcing their way into the China team's territory. The left and right wings shot twice, but both missed. The China team took the opportunity to attack, but suddenly committed a foul and were counterattacked by the enemy. The Federation team was rescued by the defense in the back. Before long, they were attacked again, but fortunately, goalkeeper Yaji caught the ball and saved the situation, taking the opportunity to counterattack the China team's territory. The forwards shot twice, but both were saved by goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan.</p>
<h3>China Unluckily Offside</h3>
<p>Before long, the China team took advantage of a counterattack against the Federation team and obtained a left-wing shot, but it missed. The Federation team broke through and counterattacked until they were in front of the China team's goal. Left inside forward Zhang Zhongwan took two consecutive shots, both rolling out of bounds on the left side of the goal. Afterward, in the midfield, the Federation team committed a foul once, and the China team also committed a foul once. The Federation team was attacked again. At the critical moment, goalkeeper Yaji caught the ball. The Federation team took the opportunity to counterattack into the China team's territory. The ball rolled out on the right side of the goal. The Federation team was treated the same way. One ball was about to go into the net but rolled to the side of the goal post. At the critical moment, the China team was unluckily offside, allowing the Federation team to escape the danger. Before long, the China team committed a handball twice. Time passed quickly, and at 5:35, the referee blew the whistle for a break. The first half ended in a draw.</p>
<h3>Center Forward Dai Opens the Scoring</h3>
<p>In the second half, the sides were switched. China kicked off and advanced directly. The Federation team was forced to commit a right corner kick. Fortunately, it didn't go in. Before long, they committed another right corner kick. The ball fell into the goal. Goalkeeper Yaji, due to the sun, had difficulty responding. He urgently raised his hand to push it out, but it was headed in by Dai Linjing, the center forward of the China team. Dai Linjing is a lucky general for China, and he always scores when he plays. In the Far East Games against the Philippines, he scored three goals, and against Japan, he also scored two goals. After the kickoff, the Federation team committed another right corner kick and could not break out of the siege. Before long, Dai Linjing, the center forward of the China team, kicked in another goal. He truly lived up to his reputation as a lucky general. Subsequently, the Federation team was still under pressure and committed a right corner kick, but the China team's shot was inaccurate. The ball fell behind the goal and was kicked out. They committed a handball again, but it was not very dangerous. At this time, the players of the Federation team, hoping to retaliate, fought hard and counterattacked the opposing team's territory. They attacked twice but missed. On the third attempt, they suddenly went offside. The China team took the opportunity to counterattack but also attacked twice without success. The China team suddenly committed a foul, and their momentum was slightly dampened. They were attacked twice again, but both failed. Afterward, the Federation team committed two left and right corner kicks, and the China team committed a foul once, but none of them had any results.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Federation Makes a Final Effort</h3>
<p>In the last five minutes, the audience felt that the Federation team had no chance to retaliate. Before long, the ball rolled into the China team's territory. Huang Jihe, the right inside forward of the Federation team, passed the ball to Feng Wenxun, the left winger. The ball was forced to the front of the China team's goal. Wenxun kicked with his left foot, and the ball went into the net. China conceded one goal. As they resumed the kickoff, the heartless silver whistle blew, and the teams were called to end the game, with a final score of two to one. The China team won.</p>

<p>Contacted the Hong Kong Association</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) At 5:00 PM on July 15th, the Hong Kong Football Association suddenly convened an urgent meeting, and the situation seemed very serious. According to reporters who inquired with people in the Association, the Association suddenly received a telegram from the English Football Association that day, inquiring whether the China Football Team, which was going to Europe this time, had contacted the Hong Kong Association. Therefore, they convened a temporary emergency meeting to discuss the reply. It is now heard that they have telegraphed to England to report that the team going to Europe did not contact them.

<h3>The Ministry of Education Promotes Enrollment in Phonetic Symbol Training Classes</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education initiated the Phonetic Symbol Training Classes, representatives from various party and government agencies in the capital have eagerly signed up to participate. Recently, the Ministry of Education has received letters from teachers and staff of various schools in the capital and party members from various districts, expressing their willingness to participate. Considering that party members and teachers and staff of various schools should devote themselves to the literacy movement, it is necessary for them to participate in the training. Therefore, yesterday (the 24th), the Ministry sent letters to the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters, asking them to instruct the various district party branches to each recommend one person from their respective branches to participate in the training. Tuition fees will be waived as per regulations. At the same time, letters were also sent to various public schools and approved private schools in the capital, as well as various educational institutions, asking them to recommend one or two teachers or staff members to participate in the training. However, since the start of the school year is very close, they are specifically ordering the participating members to bring the letter of recommendation from their respective institutions, fill out the resume form, and submit it along with the tuition fee (four yuan per person, waived for members recommended by the Party Headquarters) to the Ministry by the 28th of this month, in order to arrange seating.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education's Review of Past Books</h3>
<p>Phonetic Symbol Training Booklet</p>
<p>Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson</p>
<p>Zhao Tingwei, an editor and reviewer of the Ministry of Education, reported the process of editing and reviewing books at the Central Radio Station the other day. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>In the past six months, in addition to continuing to review textbooks and translate scientific terms, the Editorial and Review Department of the Ministry of Education has paid special attention to the editing of popular reading materials. Currently, two kinds of popular reading materials have been completed, one is the Phonetic Symbol Training Booklet, and the other is the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson. These two popular reading materials were both edited in response to a central command.</p>
<p>The Phonetic Symbol Training Booklet is divided into two parts. The first part is phonetic symbols and spelling exercises, and the second part is the text, with an attached teaching outline and a brief explanation of the pronunciation of phonetic symbols for teachers' reference. The text in this Phonetic Symbol Training Booklet is compiled using rhymed prose with connected meaning. Not only are there many repeated exercises for the spelling of phonetic symbols, but it is also quite interesting to read. This can be regarded as the most important feature of the Phonetic Symbol Training Booklet. The editing time for the Phonetic Symbol Training Booklet was less than a month, so it can be said to be a relatively easy task. However, the editing process of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson was extremely complicated. Today I would like to briefly report on the editing process of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson. The editing of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson includes three tasks. The first is word selection, which is to count the most commonly used one thousand words from nearly one million words of material as the basis for the words used in the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson. The second is material selection, which is to use meticulous methods to select the most important articles on the history, geography, natural science, hygiene, and other subjects of the Three Principles of the People as the material for the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson. The third is editing the text. The Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson is considered to be completed only after the text is edited. The general situation of these three tasks is briefly described as follows: (1) Word Selection Work The first step of word selection work is to collect materials as the basis for word selection. We collected the following types of materials in a very short period of time: The first category: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's works The Three Principles of the People, The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, The Industrial Plan, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Theory, the Declaration of the First National Congress, and The Preliminary Steps of Democracy, a total of six. The second category: Promotional publications Seven movement promotion pamphlets, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's posthumous teachings on youth, agriculture, industry, and commerce, the movement to abolish consular jurisdiction, etc., twelve in total. The third category: Laws and regulations and proclamations Seven local autonomy laws and regulations, eighty-one proclamations. The fourth category: Daily newspapers and publications Government gazettes, daily newspapers, and magazines, five in total. The fifth category: Popular books Talks on Ancient and Modern Times, etc., ten in total. The sixth category: Miscellaneous Five hundred and ninety-seven letters, fifty vouchers, fifty-one advertisements, and approximately five hundred and sixty signs and posters.</p>
<p>The second step of word selection work is word counting. All the staff of the Editorial and Review Department of the Ministry of Education are responsible for the word counting work. In order to be concise, we used radicals to count the frequency of each character. The total number of words in each material is as follows: The first category totaled 324,452 words, accounting for 51.524 percent of the total number of words. The second category totaled 110,374 words, accounting for 17.521 percent of the total number of words. The third category totaled 21,462 words, accounting for 2.407 percent of the total number of words. The fourth category totaled 55,936 words, accounting for 8.811 percent of the total number of words. The fifth category totaled 27,971 words, accounting for 6.515 percent of the total number of words. The sixth category totaled 79,755 words, accounting for 12.662 percent of the total number of words. The total is 629,950 words. The third step of word selection is to extract the individual characters with the highest and more frequent occurrences from the frequency obtained from word counting. The result of compiling them in order of frequency is that there are 120 characters with a frequency of 1001 or more, 179 characters with a frequency between 501 and 1000, 296 characters with a frequency between 201 and 500, 305 characters with a frequency between 101 and 200, 44 characters with a frequency between 91 and 100, 48 characters with a frequency between 81 and 90, 61 characters with a frequency between 71 and 80, 64 characters with a frequency between 61 and 70, and 92 characters with a frequency between 50 and 60. The characters with a frequency below 50 are omitted. The total number of characters with a frequency of 50 or more is 1189. The word selection this time is not very reliable because the time was too hasty and the materials collected were too few (less than one million words). Therefore, 80% of the words used in the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson are based on the results of this word selection, and 20% are still based on common sense judgment. (2) Material Selection Work Because the editing of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson is not only to teach the public to read, but also to instill various knowledge, we have to be particularly careful about the selection of textbook materials. The Editorial and Review Department has established a Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Lesson Material Selection Committee, which is responsible for the material selection work. There are four characteristics in the material selection method (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Head of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Head of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao Assassinated Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>In Front of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on Fuzhou Road</p>
<p>Assassin Snatches Zhao in Vital Area</p>
<p>Died of Serious Injuries Last Night at Nine O'Clock</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao, the head of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was suddenly assassinated yesterday morning in front of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Bund of Fuzhou Road. He was shot in the waist, and his injuries were serious. He was immediately rushed to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. The treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital at nine o'clock last night. The murderer has escaped without a trace. Assassination cases in Shanghai are already common, but assassinating important people in broad daylight in a busy city is still rare. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Gunshot Wound to a Vital Area. Zhao always had bodyguards when he went to the office every day. Yesterday, because his wife, Ms. Huang, had to go shopping at the Xin Xin Company, Zhao went to the office with his bodyguards from his residence at No. 39 Luban Road in his private car, No. 4347. His wife also accompanied him in the car. At about 8:45, they arrived at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The bodyguard, Liu Hua, got out of the car first to open the door. Zhao then got out of the car calmly, and was about to step into the office. His wife remained in the car, and the driver was about to drive away when gunshots suddenly rang out, two loud pops, like a rickshaw tire exploding. Zhao had just stepped onto the stone steps, and a bullet shot through his waist from behind. Zhao knew he had been shot, but his mind was still clear. He pressed his wound with his hand and shouted, "I've been assassinated, I've been assassinated!" and ran straight upstairs. However, halfway up the stairs, he turned back downstairs, waving to the armed police in the office to chase the murderer. The police immediately rushed outside, blowing police whistles and chasing towards the Bund.</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao Sent Off</p>
<p>The Murderer Escaped. Zhao's wife and the driver also heard the gunshots clearly in the car, but were unable to help. The bodyguard, Liu Hua, was 25 years old and from Shandong. He was originally a wharf inspector at the bureau and usually carried a pistol when escorting Zhao. Yesterday, because he was changing his new credentials, he had not yet received his pistol. Therefore, he was only providing protection with his bare hands in the car. After the murderer fired the gun, Liu Hua took advantage of the situation and threw himself to the ground, pretending to be injured. When the bodyguard got up from the ground and chased after the crowd, the murderer had already escaped without a trace. They immediately telegraphed the police station, and the police station immediately ordered a large team of armed detectives to rush to the scene to inspect the area, and sent detectives to the hospital to inquire about the details of the incident. They ordered a strict search for the murderer. As for how many murderers there were, according to eyewitnesses at the bureau, there were three murderers. One was wearing a cooked silk long gown, one was wearing a black Indian silk long gown, and one was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants. They were mixed in with the rickshaw pullers, so no one paid attention to them. When Zhao arrived at the bureau, the one wearing the cooked silk long gown took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired two shots at Zhao's back. One bullet entered from the right rib and exited from the side of the chest. The other bullet was intended to hit the bodyguard but missed.</p>
<p>Ineffective Treatment. After Zhao was assassinated, it was originally intended to send him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Suddenly, he remembered that Fan Zhengbo's gunshot wound had been cured at the Red Cross Hospital, so he decided to go to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. He arrived at the hospital at 9:30. Dr. Bai Liangzhi (a Westerner) and Dr. Ji Changgeng (a Chinese) consulted with Zhao himself and performed surgery at 11:00. They found that the bullet had passed through, and the intestines were fine, but the liver was completely damaged, and the bleeding would not stop. They determined that the injury was very dangerous. At 7:00 p.m., they performed a blood transfusion. Five people were willing to donate blood to Zhao. At that time, Zhao's condition was still stable, but his pulse was very high, at 160 beats per minute. Dr. Ji told our reporter after performing the surgery yesterday afternoon that Zhao's entire liver had been damaged by the bullet, and the bleeding would not stop. At most, there was only a 50% chance of survival. If there were no changes within 72 hours, there might be hope for recovery.</p>
<p>Died Last Night</p>
<p>The doctors at the hospital believed that Zhao's entire liver had ruptured, and the wound was bleeding and could not be stopped. Although they borrowed blood from others and administered artificial transfusions, they were unable to save him. He died in the hospital at 9:00 last night.</p>
<p>Zhao's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao was from Yongning, Sichuan. He was a member of the Kuomintang and the founder of the Shuanglun Toothbrush Factory. He served as the Director of the Finance Department of the Sichuan Jingguo Army Headquarters, the President of the Wuwu Weekly, the Wuwu Daily, and the Morning Post, and the General Manager of the Sichuan Junchuan Yuan Guan Bank. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, he was appointed as the Head of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and it has been more than two years now.</p>
<h3>Handover of Concession Telephone at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The International Company is scheduled to take over the business next month. The case of the sale of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company to the International Company was approved by the company's shareholders' meeting and then agreed by the工部局. It was submitted to the consular body for review and has been formally approved by the consular body. All the details have been revised, and other procedures have also been completed. It has now been determined to implement the handover according to the agreement at the end of this month. Representatives of the new company are still in Shanghai. It is scheduled to be taken over by the new company on August 1st. However, the new articles of association have not yet been published, so all changes will be implemented starting in the winter.</p>
<h3>Chinese Telephone Users in the Concession Telegraph to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company Chinese Telephone Users Association telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying, "To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, this Association has learned that the International Telephone and Telegraph Company purchased the property of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company without our country's approval, and illegally obtained a 40-year patent right. Although our government has protested and the public has opposed it, the company has not stopped its activities. Moreover, newspapers have reported that the company will formally sign the contract within ten days to complete the procedures. This Association is deeply saddened and outraged. Regarding this case, this Association telegraphed your Ministry on the day of the incident, earnestly requesting that a serious negotiation be initiated to recover our rights. However, half a month has passed, and we have not seen any telegram indicating the progress of the matter. This Association is extremely apprehensive. Upon investigation, the American Consul, Mr. Ke Yinhai, stated in his letter to your Ministry on June 26th of this year that the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company is British property and should be governed by British law. Regarding the transfer of its property, the decision should be made by the majority of the shareholders' meeting. As for the granting of patent rights for the operation of the telephone business, the工部局 has full authority to execute it according to the 洋涇浜 Regulations. This is a strong argument that disregards reason. The 洋涇浜 Regulations were originally a byproduct of unequal treaties, and the recovery of the concessions is a clearly defined policy of the Party and the country. Your Ministry is also preparing to negotiate the recovery of the concessions within a year. If the company and its affiliated country have any heart of friendship, they should not ignore our country's sovereignty and carry out such a blatant act of aggression in the midst of calls to abolish unequal treaties and recover the concessions. Moreover, even according to the 洋涇浜 Regulations, the工部局 has no right to grant private individuals patent rights for telephones. Therefore, their far-fetched reasoning is even more obvious. The reasons why this case cannot be ignored are listed below (a total of five points, which are the same as the letter to Minister Wu Chaoshu, which has been reported in previous newspapers and will be omitted). In summary, it can be seen that the importance of this case requires your Ministry to actively and seriously negotiate and find ways to promote its reflection in order to protect national rights and seek the welfare of the people. Therefore, we telegraph your Ministry again, earnestly requesting that you carry out the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy, strongly refute the American Consul's reply, and request to be informed of the steps taken in this case in order to comfort public opinion. This telegram is respectfully submitted, and we hope that you will give it your consideration."</p>
<h3>National Conference on Abolishing Likin Postponed</h3>
<p>Decision to Hold in September</p>
<p>The date of the National Likin Abolition Conference was decided by the fourth preparatory meeting to be August 15th in Shanghai. Now, due to special reasons, it has been postponed again. Yesterday, the preparatory office of the conference received instructions from Minister Song, stating that due to the current military situation, the stubborn enemies Yan and Feng have not yet been eliminated. The provinces have been affected by the war, and there have been obstacles to the abolition of likin. For the sake of prudence, the implementation of likin abolition and other matters still require careful discussion. The 15th of August is still too rushed, as there is no preparation. Therefore, it has been decided to hold it in September. The exact date will be determined at a meeting.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to Sino-Egyptian Treaty</h3>
<p>Telegraphs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Announce the Contents of the Agreement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as the scope and content of the new Sino-Egyptian treaty have not been announced, has received inquiries from silk and other groups. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request information on the scope of the agreement. The original telegram stated, "To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, this Chamber received a letter from the Preparatory Committee of the Silk Industry Group of this city, stating that it received a letter from the Henan and Shandong Silk Industry Association, stating that it was reported by the industry that Egypt had enacted a new law requiring that goods imported from countries without treaties be subject to double the heavy tax. If our government does not sign a new treaty with Egypt within this extension period, then our silk goods sold to Egypt will be greatly affected. We have also received a letter from Lirong Foreign Firm, stating that it received a telegram from abroad stating that Egypt has enacted a new law, the main purpose of which is to increase the tariffs on imported goods from countries that have not signed treaties with Egypt. We do not know whether the Chinese government has prepared to sign a commercial treaty with Egypt. We hope that China can complete this treaty within this extension period, otherwise the implementation of this new law will be a major obstacle to the export of Chinese native products to Egypt. Upon investigation, the new law enacted by Egypt is currently being extended, and the period is about to expire. It will be implemented soon. The harsh new regulations require your industry to join with silk, tea, and tobacco groups to request your government to negotiate a treaty with the Egyptian government in order to receive the same treatment as other treaty countries and protect the foreign trade of merchants. Furthermore, according to the May 30th newspaper, the new Sino-Egyptian tobacco tax treaty has been exchanged with the Egyptian minister to the UK, according to a telegram from Minister Shi in the UK. Since the new Sino-Egyptian tobacco tax treaty has been signed, it is assumed that the government is deliberating on other new treaties. Therefore, we request your association to submit it to the Standing Committee for discussion, and we hope to receive your approval to forward it to the central government to quickly sign a commercial treaty with Egypt to facilitate the promotion of domestic products abroad. We are extremely hopeful. According to this, the extension of the Egyptian new law will be implemented on September 1st of this year. Time is of the essence, and we must act quickly. We should request your association to quickly forward this to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and solemnly sign a new silk tax treaty with Egypt. According to the previous files of the Preparatory Committee, it was reported that tobacco leaves imported into Egypt from our country were subject to the highest tax rate because no commercial treaty had been signed with Egypt. The committee requested your Ministry to quickly negotiate a new treaty with that country to remedy the situation. Although no approval has been received so far, the newspaper reports that this agreement has been established and exchanged. However, Chinese goods shipped to Egypt are not limited to tobacco leaves. The current agreement is a substitute for a commercial treaty and should naturally include all kinds of goods from our country. There is no reason to only refer to tobacco leaves. The newspaper's reference to a new tobacco leaf treaty is suspected of being a misunderstanding. However, since this case has not been approved by your Ministry from beginning to end, it is impossible to speculate on the scope of the newly signed agreement. In case the agreement is limited to tobacco leaves, as the newspaper reported, how should silk and other Chinese goods exported to Egypt be handled quickly? Please telegraph Minister Shi in the UK to negotiate with that country to supplement and include the agreement to avoid omissions and facilitate sales. Your Ministry should have the power to weigh the pros and cons. The period for the extension of the implementation is about to expire. We only hope that you will handle it quickly to facilitate salvage, which is for the public good. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation Requests Reduction of Overseas Chinese Passport Fees</h3>
<p>Lists Five Reasons for Vowing to Oppose</p>
<p>Separately Reduce, Exempt, and Abolish Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, the various courts and departments of the National Government, and various committees, saying, "This Association has learned of the 20 articles of the Provisional Regulations on the Issuance of Passports for Going Abroad promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the 14 articles of the Provisional Regulations on the Issuance of Passports for Returning to China and the Issuance of Visas for Foreigners Coming to China by embassies and consulates abroad. This Association has not received any notice, and domestic newspapers have not published them. However, various overseas Chinese organizations have copied the articles and sent telegrams, requesting a general telegram to represent the unanimous and sworn opposition of all overseas Chinese. After reviewing the articles of the two regulations, this Association is extremely shocked and indignant. We will now briefly state the points that are difficult to implement to the Party and the government: (1) The passport fee is six yuan per passport and two yuan for stamp duty. No protection will be given if no passport is obtained when going abroad. The meaning of a passport is to prove nationality so that the country and the embassies and consulates of our country in that country can provide protection according to the treaty. The handling fee should only slightly subsidize the cost of paper and ink. It should not be used to increase the revenue of the department or the national treasury. All countries in the world are the same. As for overseas Chinese, there are special circumstances that are very different from ordinary inspections, investigations, travel, study, and business. Our people are trapped by food and clothing, or suffer from natural disasters, wars, disasters, and bandits. There is no place to live in the mainland. They have no choice but to abandon their parents, abandon their wives, and leave their hometown and entrust themselves to foreigners, suffering all kinds of harsh treatment. Even without discussing this, the cost of traveling abroad is either from selling property or selling children, or from borrowing and begging to be able to make the trip. After reaching the shore, there is also an entry tax, ranging from dozens of yuan to more than one hundred yuan, before they can enter the country. Our government's national rights cannot reach abroad, and it cannot fulfill its responsibility to protect overseas Chinese in various places. It is enough to be heartbroken. Now, under the pretext of obtaining a passport, a fee of up to eight yuan is charged per passport. The number of overseas Chinese going abroad, taking Shantou as an example, averages 15,000 people per month. Adding Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other ports, the annual total is more than 50 million people. This is a revenue of 4 million yuan. How much blood and marrow do overseas Chinese have? How can they bear such a heavy burden? This should be the first thing that represents the unanimous and sworn opposition of all overseas Chinese. (2) The fee for obtaining a passport to return to China is the same as for going abroad. Although overseas Chinese in various countries have an entry tax that is more severe than a tiger, there is no exit tax. Now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to charge overseas Chinese a fee of eight yuan for obtaining a passport to return to China, which is even more severe than the entry tax in various countries where overseas Chinese reside. This should be the second thing that represents the unanimous and sworn opposition of all overseas Chinese. (3) Renew passports every year and pay fees every year. According to the common practice of various countries, nationals obtain passports to go abroad and passports to return to China. This is a necessary procedure, but there is no example of renewing passports every year. Now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has set a harsh rule of renewing passports every year, with the intention of collecting eight yuan in passport fees every year. From this, it can be deduced that overseas Chinese go abroad at the end of the year and pay eight yuan, renew their passports the following year and pay eight yuan, and obtain passports to return to China and pay eight yuan. Within thirteen or fourteen months, they must obtain passports three times and pay twenty-four yuan. Such harsh regulations can be said to be unprecedented and unparalleled in the world, and are unique to our country. This should be the third thing that represents the unanimous and sworn opposition of all overseas Chinese. (4) Those who apply for a passport to return to China must check the passport when they went abroad before it can be issued. Some overseas Chinese went abroad decades ago. How can they have passports? This method is almost impossible for overseas Chinese to return to their home country. The error is so extreme that it is extremely shocking. This should be the fourth thing that represents the unanimous and sworn opposition of all overseas Chinese. (5) Violation of legislative procedures. It is necessary to give passports, protect overseas Chinese, and increase the burden on overseas Chinese. Legislation cannot be implemented with a single ministry order. Now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to obtain money, regardless of violating legislative procedures, and does not submit it to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government to be handed over to the Legislative Yuan for consultation with the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, discussion, and revision. It actually uses the four characters of "provisional regulations" to cover up its crime of violating the law. This should be the fifth thing that represents the unanimous and sworn opposition of all overseas Chinese. Briefly listing five points, the pain has reached this extreme. Other harsh and abusive articles, such as paying fees for lost passports, and detaining and dealing with those who do not obtain passports to return to China at the customs, how to deal with them, and there is no clear text, are too numerous to mention. We believe that our government is daily advocating for the protection of overseas Chinese and attracting overseas Chinese to return to the country to start industries, but the result is the opposite. Recently, the Ministry of Communications increased postage rates for overseas Chinese, and this association has not completely ended its efforts to fight for it. Now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced the method of obtaining passports and paying fees. Although overseas Chinese have a reputation for being rich, the rich are one in a thousand, and the poor are 999 in a thousand. Our Party and government should follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to abolish unequal treaties with various countries and do their best to protect overseas Chinese, so as not to suffer all kinds of harsh treatment in the countries where they reside. Then overseas Chinese will be inspired, and they will come without being summoned. If we ignore unequal treaties and allow overseas Chinese to cry out in pain under the knives of foreigners, and even repeatedly think of ways to raise money from overseas Chinese, no matter how much everyone has a heart, they will not be willing to endure it. Even if they want to do their best to meet the government's needs, they suffer from the fact that 999 out of 1,000 are poor and unable to bear the burden. This association represents more than 10 million overseas Chinese at home and abroad. It has received Mr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions from above and the entrustment of overseas Chinese below. It has to speak frankly in order to make up for the shortcomings. We hope that you will quickly issue an order to revoke the two provisional regulations formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and strictly order the Ministry to formulate a draft in accordance with legislative procedures and submit it to the Executive Yuan and then to the Government for discussion by the Legislative Yuan, and consult with the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and this Association in order to implement it in a satisfactory manner. As for fees, overseas Chinese should be an exception. The passport fee for going abroad and returning home should be two corners each, the stamp duty should be two cents, and all harsh regulations such as paying fees for renewing passports every year and paying fees for reissuing lost passports should be abolished. We still earnestly request that our Party and government abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time, protect overseas Chinese's various freedoms of residence, commerce, work, education, speech, and action. We respectfully submit this statement at the risk of death and await your orders. The Overseas Chinese Federation respectfully kowtows."</p>
<h3>News of the Labor Strike at the French-Owned Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>Secretary Geng Visited the French Consul General Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Staff Participation. Company staff have been participating in the strike movement for days, with over a hundred people already involved. However, there are still a small number of staff who have not joined. The union has sent letters of warning. It is now known that after receiving the warning letters, the company staff have been reporting to the union in succession to join the strike front. According to reliable sources, the small number of staff in the company will be able to report to the union completely within three days.</p>
<p>Investigating Reactionaries. At around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Wu Axiang, a worker at the union, discovered near the union that there were reactionary elements inciting workers, distributing cash, and agitating the ignorant masses to rush the roads and attack trams. He arrested the reactionary element, along with a letter of incitement, three one-yuan banknotes, two five-yuan banknotes, one silver dollar, and two fake silver dollars. The suspect's name is Li Zhongming, from Sichuan. He, along with the witnesses, have been transferred to the Second District General Bureau for strict handling.</p>
<h3>French Consul Expresses</h3>
<p>Secretary Geng of the Municipal Government visited the French Consul General the day before yesterday to discuss solutions to the labor strike. At 1:00 p.m. yesterday, Secretary Geng visited the French Consulate General again and met with French Consul General Gancolin. He returned at 2:00 p.m. It is said that Mr. Gan also hopes that the labor strike will be resolved as soon as possible and immediately agreed to mediate with the factory. However, there has been no response today, and the discussion is still ongoing. When the terms of the negotiation are discussed in the future, Mr. Gan will notify the Municipal Government, the Municipal Government will notify the Party Committee, and the Party Committee will notify the union.</p>
<h3>Support Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French-Owned Water and Electricity Company Chinese Staff Support Association held a meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The Chinese staff who had not left the factory before have now successively reported, with more than 100 staff members attending the meeting. Fan Baokun was publicly elected as the temporary chairman to report on the progress of the previous day. The following important cases were resolved: (1) Send letters to the Chinese directors of the French Concession 工部局, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the joint associations of various roads of the business community, jointly mediating in the current strike turmoil, and questioning the Chinese directors of the French Concession 工部局 as to why they have not inquired about the police's brutal killing of Chinese compatriots and the arrest of union members. (2) The expenses of the meeting are to be donated by the members according to their ability. (3) For the convenience of the proceedings, it was publicly decided to organize a group meeting and elect 22 group leaders, including Zhou Ziqing, Wu Ying, Zhu Ronghua, Su Zhonglin, Li Qingyuan, Ma Guxiang, Jiang Hongfu, Yu Wenxiang, Xu Kemin, Zhao Fengqi, Lv Defu, Wang Zixiang, Liu Jiqing, Yao Weichu, Lu Kunrong, Zhou Shaoliu, Shen Jingyi, Yao Rucheng, Wang Lingeng, Pu Liangcheng, Jing Qiuliang, and Xu Dexi.</p>
<h3>Letter to Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>Dear Chinese Directors, respectfully, the strike turmoil at the Shanghai French-Owned Water and Electricity Company has lasted for more than a month. It is understood that the factory not only does not intend to resolve the situation, but instead colludes with the police to carry out military oppression and do whatever they want, even shooting innocent people and arresting union members, resulting in the July 21st Malong Road Massacre. All compatriots are outraged and are joining together to provide assistance. However, you, as Chinese directors, have stood aside and have not asked about it, which is extremely surprising and incomprehensible. Please understand the crisis, are you willing to sit idly by? We are sending this letter to you and earnestly requesting that you express your support for the murdered and arrested compatriots immediately. There is no room for hesitation. The strike turmoil is expanding day by day. If the stalemate continues, it will not be a blessing for society. You have the power to make a difference. If you can come forward to mediate, the labor strike may be quelled, allowing hundreds of striking workers to return to work as soon as possible, and our colleagues can also return to their jobs at the same time. We are looking forward to it. This is a special request, and we ask for your consideration. (The letter to the Shanghai French Concession General Federation has the same general meaning and will be omitted.)</p>
<h3>Letter to the French Consul</h3>
<p>The Support Association sent a letter to the French Consul saying, "Respectfully, on July 21st, 1920, at 8:00 a.m., the French Patrol Room sent a large number of armed patrolmen to Malong Road, who shot and injured more than 20 of our Republic of China workers and killed one civilian without any reason, causing great chaos in social order and arousing public outrage to the extreme. The actions of our Chinese workers on Malong Road were purely the most legitimate labor movement. Your Consul, who has always claimed to be peaceful, should have provided considerable protection. Unexpectedly, the French Patrol Room immediately sent a large number of armed patrolmen and opened fire without authorization, killing civilians. The Patrol Room, which is responsible for maintaining local security, has instead disrupted order, destroyed justice, and violated humanity to an extreme extent. Your Consul's position is responsible for the occurrence of this tragedy and cannot shirk its responsibility. Furthermore, our Chinese workers who were barbarically arrested by the French police that day should be released immediately and in large quantities. In order to maintain justice, protect the lives of the people, and safeguard the relations between China and France, this Association is hereby notifying you. If such unfortunate events occur again in the future, the people of our Republic of China will have the right to self-defense and resistance. This should be given a warning in advance, so as to maintain justice and value the law. This is addressed to the French Consul in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Telegraph to the National Government</h3>
<p>The Support Association telegraphed the Nanjing National Government yesterday, saying, "To the National Government, the labor strike at the French-Owned Water and Electricity Company in Shanghai has lasted for nearly a month. French capitalists are using the power of imperialism to not only have no sincerity in accepting the formal demands of the labor side, but also use a large number of running dogs to shoot and kill compatriots, resulting in the unfortunate tragedy of July 21st. The cause of the labor strike was originally that the cost of living in Shanghai is high, and the income of laborers is not enough to make a living. The formal demands are very reasonable. However, the capital of the imperialists has refused to show any sympathy and has always refused, forcing them to strike, which is even more pitiful. Unexpectedly, the capital side has used severe measures and even dared to open fire with a large number of patrolmen, killing and injuring dozens of our manual workers. Such audacity is really contemptuous of national discipline and trampling on the lives of the people. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Moreover, Shanghai is the largest city in our country, and various countries have concession lands. If this case is allowed to go uninvestigated, other countries will follow suit, and the consequences will be dire. We, as members of the association, are fellow citizens who share the same hatred and cannot bear to see this bloody tragedy happen again and again in Shanghai, the largest city in our country. Therefore, we are telegraphed to your government, urgently requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be ordered to submit a serious negotiation to uphold national rights and protect the lives of the people. This cannot be more urgent, July 23rd."</p>
<h3>Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Since the tragedy occurred at the French-Owned Water and Electricity Company labor strike, various unions have come forward to provide assistance. All declarations have been excerpted in previous newspapers. Now, the Steamboat Wood Industry Union, the Dried Goods Workers Union, and the Sauce Industry Workers Union have all issued declarations yesterday, which are stern and righteous, and the texts are long and will be omitted.</p>

<h3>Special District Court Schedules Public Burning of Opium</h3>
<p>July 30th, 10:00 AM</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Special District Local Court has scheduled the burning of all confiscated opium on the 30th of this month. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to various agencies and organizations, inviting them to send representatives to supervise at that time, to demonstrate impartiality. The original letter is transcribed below: To Whom It May Concern: This court has been established for three months, from April 1st to June 30th. All opium and paraphernalia for smoking or manufacturing opium confiscated in the warehouse of seized goods should be burned immediately according to regulations. It is now scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on July 30th at the Yizhong Gap Land of the Bao'an Hall, to the right of our hospital on North Zhejiang Road, in addition to reporting and sending announcements. We should also send a letter to you for reference, and send personnel to supervise the burning to show caution.</p>
<h3>Shipping Guild Requests Continued Protection of the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Regarding the Detention of Captain Da Xing</p>
<p>The Shipping Guild sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating: To Whom It May Concern: It has been investigated that if licensed officers of steamships cause accidents in collisions, it is unintentional. Shipping companies invest heavily and can hardly avoid this. In the event of an accident, the officials on the scene record the name of the ship and obtain a signed certificate from the captain of the ship as evidence for future investigation and judgment. It is hoped that the captain will not be detained on the spot to avoid business interruption and navigation obstruction. A list of members is attached, requesting that the water patrol team be instructed to follow these procedures for all large and small ships of the listed members. The Bureau subsequently replied in Letter No. 332, stating: Approved to the Chamber's Letter No. 42, which included the submission of a list of members and a list of steamships, requesting that the water patrol police be instructed to record the names of the ships in the event of collisions and to obtain signatures from the captain or senior officer as evidence for subsequent summons and disposition. With this approval, our Bureau expressed deep sympathy for the measures proposed by your Chamber. In addition to ordering the water patrol team to comply, a corresponding letter was sent to your Chamber for reference. All members were notified and expressed their gratitude. However, according to the Da Xing Company, the Da Xing steamship injured a barge sailor this morning when turning into the port. The water patrol team immediately detained He Shengzhang, the captain of the Da Xing steamship. The Company immediately stated to the water patrol team that in June of this year, the Company received a notice from the Guild stating that henceforth, if large or small ships cause collisions, the water patrol team should record the name of the ship and obtain a signed certificate from the captain or senior officer as evidence for subsequent investigation and judgment. No arrests should be made on the spot. A reply has already been received from the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau approving this. Please handle this case accordingly. However, the water patrol team replied that they had not yet received instructions from the Bureau regarding the above measures and refused to comply, and the captain was still detained. The water patrol team is a unit directly under the Public Security Bureau. Since the senior officer has already replied with instructions to comply, it is surprising that they still claim they have not received instructions and refuse to comply. The Chamber of Commerce should send a letter to the Public Security Bureau to inquire whether instructions have been issued and allow the captain, He Shengzhang, to be released and summoned for questioning to avoid hindering his duties. While preparing the letter, the Company reported that He Shengzhang had already been transferred by the Public Security Bureau to the local court. Please find a way to handle this. The Chamber of Commerce has already sent a letter to the Shanghai Local Court requesting that he be released on bail pending trial. However, since the Bureau has already replied and instructed compliance, it is now unclear whether the Bureau has not yet issued instructions or whether the water patrol team has received instructions but is not complying. This is truly perplexing. A special letter is sent to request investigation and reply to clarify the truth and dispel doubts. We sincerely value your public service.</p>
<h3>Grain Trade Association Reaffirms Rice Purchase Certificate Order</h3>
<p>Notice from the Rice Store Trade Association Reorganization Committee to all rice stores: The Social Affairs Bureau has issued an order to handle the purchase of rice with certificates, with the intention of eliminating secret rebates and various malpractices, and relieving our fellow traders of the suffering they have endured. The law is good and the intention is good, and our fellow traders should comply. Since the start of this system, many have complied with the order and purchased rice with certificates, but quite a few are still waiting and watching. It is hereby emphatically announced again that all rice stores must know that our fellow traders have suffered deeply from the evils of secret rebates. Since the authorities are determined to eliminate them thoroughly, they should respect the intention and comply as soon as possible. Regardless of whether purchasing rice in the north or south market, it is necessary to first go to the Zhabei office of this association to make a statement and obtain a certificate. Anyone who purchases rice without a certificate is deemed to be engaging in private transactions. Once discovered, they will be considered to have violated the price limit and will be subject to a fine of 1,000 yuan. Do not blame this association for not being able to protect the interests of its fellow traders. This is a further warning.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Holds Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Disapproval of Funds Distributed to Re-elected Committee Members</p>
<p>During the General Assembly of the Chinese Red Cross, the re-elected committee members Ye Zhisheng, Wu Jiasan, Gu Keyong, Dong Lin, and others each received more than 500 yuan of public funds from the General Association. Members Jiang Qisheng, Ji Qiao, and others believe that these public funds were donated by philanthropists nationwide. The few re-elected committee members colluded with corrupt elements in the General Association and used these funds to buy off representatives of a small number of branches, intending to overturn the election. The General Assembly should send a formal letter of inquiry to the relevant members. At the 96th Standing Committee meeting of the General Association, Chairman Wang Yiting presented this letter for public discussion. It was generally agreed that the various expenses of the representative conference are currently being reviewed item by item by the Economic Committee. The Economic Committee believes that Wu Jiasan's loan of 120 yuan in foreign currency in the name of the Shexian branch and the subsidies received by various representatives are incomplete and have not been signed. A factual reply should be sent first. Based on this decision, a reply was sent to the inquiry from member Jiang and others. As for the funds distributed to Wu Jiasan and others, Chairman Zhu Peiyuan has sent a letter urging their return, but there has been no response to date. It is said that if Wu continues to deny the matter, legal action will be taken to recover the funds.</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Formulates Internship Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has established four commodity inspection offices one after another. The commodity inspection business is gradually expanding, and the talent and equipment are gradually being improved. In addition to the Guangzhou and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus sending personnel to the Bureau for internships in raw silk and cotton inspection, domestic universities, organizations, and factories are also increasingly requesting to send people to the Bureau for internships. If no regulations and restrictions are established, difficulties will inevitably arise in office affairs. Therefore, nine articles of internship regulations have been specially formulated, in addition to submitting them to the Bureau Affairs Meeting for approval, and also reporting them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for filing. The nine articles of the regulations are transcribed below: (Article 1) Any domestic universities, organizations, factories, etc. that wish to send people to the Bureau for internships must first prepare a formal letter and introduce them to the Bureau, and at the same time send the intern's name, age, place of origin, academic qualifications, and purpose of the internship. After the Bureau reviews and approves it and notifies them, they can come to the Bureau for internships. (Article 2) The number of interns is limited to three at the same time in the raw silk inspection office, two at the same time in the livestock and by-products inspection office, one at the same time in the chemical inspection office, and two at the same time in the cotton inspection office. If the number of people at the same time exceeds the quota, or the inspection office is too busy to take care of them, the internship may be declined. (Article 3) Each internship period is limited to three weeks. The working hours during the internship period are notified to the interns by the director of the inspection office, and the internships are conducted on time. The inspection office may extend the aforementioned internship period if it deems it necessary. (Article 4) Interns must obey all the work assigned by the inspection office and the guidance of the director, technicians, and other personnel. In the event of violations of regulations, the Bureau may terminate their internship at any time. (Article 5) For the consumables such as medicines and electricity used by interns during the internship, the Bureau may charge a fee if it deems it necessary, and the amount consumed may be calculated and paid accordingly. If the instruments and equipment are damaged due to the internship, the value may be estimated and compensated accordingly. The person who sent the intern is responsible for paying the above-mentioned fees. (Article 6) Interns are responsible for their own food and accommodation, and the Bureau will not provide them. (Article 7) Interns and those who sent them are responsible for the intern's physical safety, treatment of illness, and all actions, and the Bureau will not manage them. (Article 8) Matters not covered in these regulations will be handled by the director of the inspection office in consultation with the director of the Bureau. (Article 9) These regulations will be reported by the Bureau to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for filing and implementation.</p>
<h3>National Goods Traveling Troupe Adds Goods for the Third Time</h3>
<p>Shipping to Qingdao Today</p>
<p>The Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association has received a telegram from the National Goods Traveling Troupe inside the Qingdao National Exhibition, stating that the local citizens are very enthusiastic, and the number of people who come to visit and discuss goods is endless every day. The sales of goods can reach an average of 5,000 yuan per day, which shows that the people's hearts are inclined to national goods, which is very different from the past. There are only two weeks left in the exhibition period. In order to reward the public's enthusiasm for purchasing national goods, the troupe will gather more than 100 carefully selected high-quality national goods at the Shuntai Wharf this afternoon for shipment to the association to be participated in by manufacturers. Please note that this is the third and final addition of goods, and there will be no further loading.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Association Appeals for Donations for Shaanxi and Henan</h3>
<p>Shaanxi and southern Henan provinces have suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities for years. Recently, they have been plagued by wind and epidemic diseases. The people are dying one after another. It is heartbreaking to hear that the people are suffering such a catastrophe. Since the Disaster Relief Association's Shanghai office appealed for emergency relief for the two provinces, enthusiastic men and women from all walks of life have donated money to help. A Cantonese man, Mr. Feng, recently donated 1,000 yuan and asked to see the disaster map, and even shed tears. Ms. Zhao Liu braved the heat to come to the association and personally sent a donation of 200 yuan, saying that this is an obligation that female compatriots should fulfill and did not want to be rewarded. In addition, people from industry, commerce, and other sectors have saved money and sent donations, which is also quite a lot. The number of people who remit donations to Shanghai from afar is also increasing every day. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will have great compassion, slightly reduce their entertainment expenses, and take action to save the great disaster. This is a blessing for the disaster-stricken people of Shaanxi and Henan.</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation in Various Counties of Hanzhong, Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Report Received by the Jisheng Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association recently received a fast-mail telegram from the Shaanxi Hanzhong China-Foreign Relief Association, stating that Hanzhong is located between the Bashan Mountains and the Qinling Mountains, and most of the counties are mountainous areas with few plains. Since 1927, there has been a disaster every year. Last year, the drought raged from spring to autumn, with no rain at all. The grass and trees withered, the five grains were not harvested, the rivers and lakes dried up, and drinking water was difficult to find. Later, heavy snow brought hope for a good year, but the severe winter was unprecedented. The disaster victims had no clothes and no food, and many died miserably. Countless livestock died of cold and starvation. The situation this spring is even more tragic. Even grass roots and tree bark are no longer available. Houses are dismantled and sold, children and daughters are sold, wives and husbands are abandoned, cattle and dogs are slaughtered for food, utensils are sold cheaply, and flesh is cut to heal sores, but it is impossible to fill the stomach. The cities and fields are full of starving people. The dead are piled up and cannot be buried in time. The foul air turns into epidemics, and the number of deaths every day is more than a thousand. Hanzhong's agricultural products are mainly rice and corn. There is a lack of seeds in the spring, and there is no hope for autumn harvest. The disaster area of Hanzhong, in terms of the old twelve counties, is the most severe in Lueyang, Fengxian, Mianxian, Ningqiang, Yangxian, Xixiang, Nanzheng, and Chenggu. Bao City, Zhenba, Foping, and Liuba counties are slightly less severe. In addition, the counties under Ankang are suffering from drought, and more than two million disaster victims are waiting for relief. Only because the mountain roads are rugged, transportation is inconvenient, and postal and telegraphic messages are delayed, charitable people have not come. Although the China-Foreign Relief Association has allocated 10,000 yuan, it is difficult to help. Various charitable groups are raising relief supplies, intending to provide relief to the entire Shaanxi, and hopefully there will be no bias. We hope that your association will treat everyone equally, distribute the relief funds evenly, and allocate them to Hanzhong to help more than two million suffering people. We are eagerly awaiting your instructions. The association has done its best to provide relief to Shaanxi in the past two years, and has provided relief to more than a dozen counties in Guanzhong. However, due to the distance and mountains in the twelve counties of Hanzhong, it has not been possible to go there. Now, bandits are everywhere, relief funds are exhausted, and there is no way to provide assistance. It is hoped that benevolent people from all over the world will have compassion on the dying people, quickly provide clothes and food, give alms and create blessings, in order to save the catastrophe.</p>

<h3>Special District Court Continues Hearing of the Grand Theater Case</h3>
<p>Witnesses From Both Sides Not All Present</p>
<p>The Case Will Be Difficult To Conclude Soon</p>
<p>The Grand Theater of Jing'an Temple opened the film "Daredevil," starring American actor Lowe, in February of this year, which led to a lawsuit by Hong Shen. After a hearing in the former Provisional Court, the case was postponed for four months. Yesterday afternoon, the second public hearing was conducted by Zhou Han, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. The hearing lasted from 2:15 to 3:45 PM, and it was ruled that the hearing would be adjourned to another date because more witnesses needed to be summoned. The case was highly valued by society when it first occurred. Although a long time has passed, students, the film industry, and other intellectuals have not forgotten it. After 1:00 PM yesterday, people went to the first courtroom of the court to listen to the hearing. Because of the recent Huang Baiying case, in which the audience was too crowded, the court specially dispatched bailiffs to guard the door of the courtroom and restricted entry, so there were only more than 200 people listening in the courtroom, all of whom were male, with no women present. The police dispatched a police car to the side door of the court on Qipu Road when the hearing began, and deployed many Chinese and Western police officers to the area in front of the court to provide protection. The details of the hearing are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Hong Shen and Gao Yongqing Arrive in Court One After Another</h3>
<p>The attorneys for the plaintiff in this case were Zhan Jifeng, Wu Chengyu, and Yao Yongli. The defense attorney for the defendant was Jiang Baoli. All of them arrived in court after 2:00 PM. The plaintiff, Hong Shen, arrived at just past 1:40 PM, and the defendant, Gao Yongqing, also arrived at 2:00 PM. Among the other witnesses, only Zheng Xiaoqiu and Yan Hemian arrived after the court opened at 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhan Jifeng States the Main Points of the Prosecution</h3>
<p>At 2:15 PM, Judge Zhou took the bench and first inquired about the names, ages, places of origin, and occupations of the plaintiff and defendant. Then, he asked how many witnesses each side had and who their names were. Because it was a new hearing, he ordered the plaintiff to state the main points of the prosecution. The plaintiff's attorney, Zhan Jifeng, stood up and stated that the defendant, the Grand Theater, was located on Jing'an Temple Road. In February of this year, the theater showed the film "Daredevil," starring Lowe, which viewers believed insulted Chinese people. The plaintiff, Hong Shen, was also in the audience and was outraged. During the intermission, he gave a speech to the audience, criticizing the theater for showing a film that insulted all Chinese people. At that time, a foreigner, under the direction of the defendant, dragged the plaintiff to the manager's office and assaulted him, and then called the police to arrest the plaintiff and detain him at the police station for three hours. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit. The main points are (1) assault on the plaintiff, (2) obstruction of the plaintiff's freedom, and (3) showing a film that insulted Chinese people. The above facts occurred on February 22nd. The Municipal Party Department received a report and sent a letter to various newspapers on the 23rd, prohibiting the publication of advertisements for the film and not allowing it to be shown. However, the defendant still published advertisements on the 24th, but changed the name of the film to "Mr. Lowe, who never speaks on the screen." This method was a deception to the public, and the defendant did not stop showing the film afterward.</p>
<h3>The Plaintiff's Lawsuit Includes a Total of Four Charges</h3>
<p>At this point, Wu Chengyu, another attorney for the plaintiff, continued, stating that the plaintiff's lawsuit included a total of four charges: (1) illegal detention by the defendant, violating Article 316 of the Criminal Law, (2) public insult, violating Article 324 of the Criminal Law, (3) knowingly spreading false information, violating Article 328 of the Criminal Law, and (4) fraud, violating Article 363 of the Criminal Law. This is because, after the Municipal Party Department banned the film, the advertisements published in Chinese newspapers changed the name of the film, but the advertisements in Western newspapers still used the name "Daredevil." He then presented two Chinese newspapers as evidence.</p>
<h3>Witnesses From Both Sides Leave the Courtroom</h3>
<p>At this time, the witness Zheng Xiaoqiu arrived with the defense attorney, Jiang Baoli, who stated that the defendant also had two witnesses. Judge Zhou then ordered the witnesses from both sides to leave the courtroom for separate questioning, to ensure impartiality, and questioned the plaintiff about the facts of the case.</p>
<h3>Hong Shen's Account of the Incident</h3>
<p>According to Hong Shen's statement, on the afternoon of February 22nd, at 3:00 PM, he accompanied a friend to the Grand Guangming Theater to see the film "Not Afraid of Death." Having only seen half of it, he could not bear to watch any further, so he returned home alone. Around 5:00 PM, he went again by himself. At about 5:20 PM, he addressed the audience. The second trip was originally to find the friend he went with the first time, hoping to inquire about the rest of the film. Upon arriving at the theater entrance, he saw several students discussing the film. Some advocated sending a letter to the "Min Guo Daily" about the film's content, requesting its disclosure, as thirty-five people had already jointly sent a letter to the newspaper the day before, also describing the film's insults to Chinese people. Others advocated speaking out to the audience. Because the students might have taken drastic action, he advised against it and went inside to describe the film's content to the audience. However, it has been a long time, and he has forgotten most of the plot details. He only remembers one part, roughly about a Chinese man selling flowers. Locke bought the flowers and took the opportunity to throw money, causing the Chinese people to fight over it. Later, Locke bought the flowers and found opium inside the flowerpot, and also others of Chinese origin being robbers, kidnappers, all kinds of despicable acts. He had also been to America before, and had never seen such behavior from overseas Chinese. The film is titled "Not Afraid of Death," and he guessed that the meaning was to say that Chinese people are all afraid of death, but Locke alone is not afraid of death, and was able to uncover this Chinese opium trafficking organization. He originally wanted to speak out the first time, but his friend advised him not to make trouble, so he returned home in a fit of pique. As it was very cold, he changed out of his Western suit into Chinese clothing and went again to speak on the stage, saying that the audience should all have a sense of patriotism and that at the very least, they should ask for a refund and not destroy the film like the Italians did to their films. The crowd then stood up and went outside to get refunds, but some people in the theater asked him about the film's content. Those who had gotten refunds then returned inside, saying that the box office refused to refund them and asked someone who knew Western languages to negotiate. He complied with the crowd's request and went outside, where he saw a Westerner. Upon learning that he was the speaker, the Westerner said he was going to arrest him and dragged him into the manager's office. Although he warned the Westerner in Western languages, the Westerner still grabbed his clothes. At this time, three constables arrived and arrested him. He learned that the Westerner was British, named Garres. He told the Western constables that he still had a hat and scarf that he needed to take with him, but the Western constables replied that his loss was not just a hat and scarf. From being dragged into the manager's office to going outside, it took about seven or eight minutes. As soon as he was arrested by the Western constables and went out the door, he met Zheng Xiaoqiu and told him the situation, instructing him to quickly report it to the Star Film Company and ask them to hire a lawyer to rescue him. On the way, he repeatedly asked what crime he had committed and who had ordered the arrest. The Western constables replied that it was ordered by Garres. When they arrived at the police station, they reported to the head constable, who had also been instructed by Garres. The Western constables finished speaking and then returned, saying that he could sit briefly and be released. He stood at the police station until 8:00 PM before leaving. Earlier, when the head constable saw him arrive, he immediately went to the Grand Guangming to investigate. When he returned, he said that the film insulted the Chinese people too much and that it was no wonder the Chinese people were angry, and that he was not satisfied either, because the film also insulted the police. The head constable also said that it would be best to publicize the content in the newspapers or ask the Municipal Party Department to ban it. He then ordered him to go outside. He was unwilling to leave, as he had been arrested for no reason. The head constable said that he was not arresting him, but only asking him to come to the police station to talk. However, when the head constable went to the Grand Guangming to investigate, one of the constables held a police baton, looking very fierce, cursing and scolding him, pointing out that he was a communist, saying that the country was strictly arresting communists, and asking why this person was not imprisoned in an iron cage. Fortunately, someone told him that the head constable was investigating and would make a decision upon his return, so the constable stopped speaking. Before leaving the police station, he intended to go to the Grand Guangming to retrieve his hat and scarf, but the head constable feared that going there might cause further trouble, so he told him not to go again. The defendant, Gao Yongqing, although he did not see him, can be confirmed from various circumstantial evidence to have been present at the theater at the time, because after the unrest occurred, Gao once invited Zheng Xiaoqiu,</p>
<h3>Gao Yongqing's Statement That He Was Not at the Theater</h3>
<p>According to the defendant Gao Yongqing's statement, the film was rented from Paramount Pictures on February 3rd or 4th. The content of ordinary films should be clarified first. If it is starred by a famous actor, there is no time to consider the content. Judge Zhou asked, "Since this film is so unfavorable to us Chinese, why rent it?" Gao replied that it had already been reviewed by the Concession Review Committee and had been given a review license. This committee is organized by the British and French Municipal Councils, and its members include both Chinese and foreigners. The minimum rental period for a film is seven days, but this film was stopped by the Party Department on February 24th, after being shown from February 21st. He goes to the theater every day, but on that day, he went to a funeral at the Ye family's house at No. 55 Kang Nao Road. He went at 2:00 PM to help with the funeral procession and returned home at 6:30 PM, so he absolutely did not go to the theater during the day. After arriving home, he received a call from the theater, reporting that a refund incident had occurred. Because the matter had already been resolved, he did not go to the theater until 9:00 PM and did not talk to Zheng Xiaoqiu, or Zheng mistook someone else. He heard Zheng's previous testimony, so he has invited witnesses to testify to his conversation with Zheng. As for the funeral procession returning home at 6:30 PM, everyone who helped with the funeral procession knows, but these witnesses have not been invited today.</p>
<h3>Yongji and Yongqing Have Similar Appearances</h3>
<p>The defendant's lawyer, Jiang Baoli, stood up and stated that the witnesses invited today, one named Gao Yongji and one named Zheng Zizhang, are intended to prove that Zheng Zizhang invited Zheng Xiaoqiu upstairs to talk to Gao Yongji on that day. Yongji is the defendant's younger brother, and his appearance is similar to the defendant. At that time, Zheng Xiaoqiu may have mistaken his younger brother for his older brother. Judge Zhou immediately ordered the bailiff to summon Gao Yongji to the court. Yongji is twenty-two years old, and only his facial skin is slightly whiter than his older brother's. The rest of his features and figure are similar.</p>
<h3>Yongji Proves He Talked to Xiaoqiu</h3>
<p>Yongji then testified that he works at the Grand Guangming box office. On February 21st, he went to the theater at 6:00 PM, and the refund tide had already occurred. He did not know Zheng Xiaoqiu, but he had heard of his name. On that day, Zheng Zizhang took the initiative to invite Xiaoqiu to mediate, because Xiaoqiu's father, Zheng Qiu, also worked with the plaintiff at the Star Film Company and they had a friendship, so he asked Xiaoqiu to ask his father to consider their hometown friendship and mediate. The conversation took place upstairs, and only he, Zizhang, and Xiaoqiu were in the room. At that time, Xiaoqiu agreed readily. He went to his brother's house at 8:00 PM to report to his brother, and he returned home at 9:00 PM, while his brother was still at home. Judge Zhou pointed out that Yongji's stated time was inconsistent with Yongqing's, and instructed him, "According to your brother's statement, he went to the Grand Guangming at 9:00 PM, but you said he was still at home at 9:00 PM, which is inconsistent." Yongji immediately replied that he may have forgotten a little and could not determine the time. Zheng Zizhang was also summoned as a witness. According to his statement, he works at the Grand Guangming. On that day, he asked Zheng Xiaoqiu to ask his father to mediate, but he did not give a definite answer. The plaintiff's lawyers, Yao Yongli and Zhan Jifeng, also briefly questioned the witness.</p>
<h3>Xiaoqiu Denies Meeting Zheng Zizhang</h3>
<p>The court ordered Zheng Xiaoqiu to be summoned to the court. According to his statement, he still remembers what he said last time. The person who requested mediation at that time was indeed the defendant himself. He had never seen his younger brother. The person who invited him upstairs was a staff member of the Grand Guangming. Judge Zhou asked if it was Zheng Zizhang. Xiaoqiu looked at Zizhang and said that it was not him.</p>
<h3>Xiaoqiu and Zizhang Confront Each Other</h3>
<p>The court then ordered the two Zhengs to confront each other. Zizhang said to Xiaoqiu, "At that time, I called you upstairs at the glass door, and I was the only one there. Why have you forgotten?" Xiaoqiu also replied, "What you said is not right. At that time, Yan Hemen and I were walking to the glass door and talking to each other when a person suddenly came and said that the boss was calling you. I didn't want to go at first, but I was forced to go by that person. If that person comes today, I can still recognize him." He also replied to lawyer Jiang that he did indeed talk to the defendant.</p>
<h3>Witness Zheng Hemen Recounts the Incident</h3>
<p>Next, witness Yan Hemen was questioned. According to his statement, he is a photographer at the Star Film Company. On February 21st, he went to see the play with his friend surnamed Cai. When he arrived, the refund turmoil had already occurred, and the audience was leaving the theater one after another. He met Xiaoqiu at the door and was told the reason. While they were talking to each other, a person in a Western suit called Xiaoqiu back to the theater. He wanted to follow, but he was stopped by the patrol at the door. Later, he saw Zhang Shichuan arrive, and he went into the theater to call Xiaoqiu out. As for what happened after Xiaoqiu was called away by the person in the Western suit, he cannot say. However, the person in the Western suit was thin and not as fat as Zheng Zizhang.</p>
<h3>Both Parties' Witnesses Must Be Summoned Again</h3>
<p>The court also asked Hong Shen how many witnesses who had not arrived were there and when they could arrive. Hong said that there were still two people, both of whom were not in Shanghai. One of them was a student and would likely return. It was unknown whether the other person would come. The court also asked the defendant what he wanted Lu Dingkui to prove. Gao said that he could prove that he was not in the theater on that day. Judge Zhou declared that Lu had not arrived because his address was wrong and could not be delivered. Since the witnesses for both sides were not all present, the case should be rescheduled to allow for summoning.</p>
<h3>Wu Chengyu Requests Speedy Proceeding</h3>
<p>Lawyer Jiang then requested that the Western constables who arrested Hong Shen be summoned to testify, and said that the Western constables were currently on leave and would not be back for three weeks. If the case was postponed, please postpone it until three weeks later. However, the plaintiff's lawyers all said that this witness was not necessary. Lawyer Wu Chengyu also said that the case had been delayed for too long and requested a speedy proceeding. Judge Zhou did not make a decision and waited for a date to continue the trial.</p>
<h3>An Unfinished New House Suddenly Collapses</h3>
<p>Two People Injured, No Major Injuries</p>
<p>The Cause of the Collapse is Unknown</p>
<p>The usually busy Jing'an Temple Road, specifically the section between Gordon Road and Muirhead Road, experienced a sudden traffic disruption yesterday evening between 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM. Thousands of onlookers gathered, causing traffic congestion and making it impossible for pedestrians to pass. Firefighters were seen rushing through the street, demolishing the collapsed three-story new building opposite the Grand China Hotel, known for its opulence. A loud crash echoed, and the roof immediately collapsed. Chinese and Western onlookers praised the firefighters' swift work, considering themselves fortunate to witness the scene. The new building at No. 153 Jing'an Temple Road, near Muirhead Road, comprised six houses. Around 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, the third floor of the four easternmost houses suddenly collapsed with a loud crash, sending dust and smoke flying. Balconies detached, and ceilings fell. One apprentice plasterer and one passerby were injured by the falling bricks and tiles. The illustration shows the state of the houses after the incident. By evening, the roofs of all the houses were exposed, bearing no resemblance to newly built houses. (Photo by Wang Xiaoting)</p>
<h3>Four Out of Six Houses Collapse</h3>
<p>Yesterday's collapse involved four houses, all facing Jing'an Temple Road, forming a row of Western-style shops. Fortunately, the two westernmost houses were unaffected. The contractor for the building was Lishun Construction Company. The project consisted of 48 houses, with both shop fronts and Western-style residences. The entire foundation was quite large, fronting Jing'an Temple Road and reaching Weihaiwei Road in the back, bordered by Gordon Road and Muirhead Road on the east and west. It was divided into four sections, from west to east. The first section was contracted by Huazhong Company, consisting of 29 houses. The second section was built by Lishunji, with 58 houses. The third section was built by Jianji Construction Company, with the same number of houses as the unfortunate Lishun, also 48 houses.</p>
<h3>A Loud Noise Signaled the House Collapse</h3>
<p>Lishun Construction Company's section started construction in mid-September last year, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. This spring, the house design was changed, causing a further delay. However, it was estimated that it would be completed in another two months. The four houses that collapsed on the east side had largely completed their wood and plumbing work, so there were very few workers upstairs and downstairs at the time of the incident. Only apprentices were making minor repairs. Around 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, a loud noise suddenly came from the third floor. Before the workers could cry out, the walls had collapsed and the roof had caved in, with balconies swaying and bricks and tiles flying everywhere.</p>
<h3>Apprentice and Pedestrian Injured</h3>
<p>Two people were injured in the incident. One was an apprentice, Sun Ahe, who was ordered by his master to go out to buy cigarettes. As he was walking out, bricks and wood fell and hit his head and face, causing him to stumble and fall, injuring both his legs. The other was Tian Hongfu, a passerby who was also injured by the collapse. Both were taken to Bao Long Hospital for treatment by Western police vehicles. Neither suffered major injuries. The apprentice, Sun Ahe, is 20 years old and from Nanhai. The pedestrian, Tian Hongfu, is 53 years old and from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Fire Trucks Provide Rescue</h3>
<p>After the incident, the Central and Xinzha Fire Brigades immediately dispatched vehicles to provide rescue. For a while, the red trucks gathered, and the sound of bells rang. The unexpected collapse of a building during the day spread throughout the neighborhood. Curious onlookers flocked to watch, crowding the streets. Rumors spread that five or six people had been crushed to death under the rubble and broken wood, but these were unfounded. Firefighters first transported the injured to the hospital for treatment and then quickly worked to ensure public safety.</p>
<h3>Sweeping Away the Debris</h3>
<p>Around 8:00 PM, crowds of pedestrians gathered, numbering in the thousands. Outside the short wall of the Grand China Hotel, those who climbed up to look and point were absorbed in the scene. Firefighters first used a ladder to climb to the highest point and then tied the end of a rope to the roof that had partially collapsed but had not yet fallen, and then pulled it down. With a loud crash, the roof fell, sweeping away the debris. By doing this several times, the dangerous situation was greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>The Cause of the Collapse Awaits Investigation</h3>
<p>The owner of the houses is said to be a Mr. Zhang, and the contractor is China Business Company, Lishun Construction Company, whose owner is Lin Wenxing from Ningbo. As for the cause of the collapse, opinions vary and cannot be speculated without expert investigation. Some say that digging for underground drains and driving piles next to the houses caused the collapse. This is just one theory for reference.</p>
<h3>The Qu and Zhou Families Contend for More Than Two Mu of Cemetery Land, Claiming Ancestry</h3>
<p>Years of Litigation Have Been Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>A New Dispute Arises from the Sale</p>
<p>Outside Xiaoximen, at Zhaojia Archway on Dalin Road (near Wuben Girls' School), there is a cemetery located at No. 189 Tanzi Weiyu, Twenty-Fifth Bao, Tenth Tu, under the name Zhou Tanxi, measuring two mu, five fen, four li, and nine hao. In the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing dynasty, Qu Xianglin, now deceased, and Zhou Juping, the former director of the Official Contract Bureau, disputed the ancestral tomb and litigated in the Shanghai County Government for many years without resolution. This spring, Zhou Zizhou Jianren (i.e., Zhou Guangyao) sold the cemetery to a person surnamed Lu. Fearing complications, Zhou preemptively asked someone to smooth things over with Qu Xianglin's wife, Qu Shenshi, and was willing to compensate the Qu family with 6,200 silver dollars. The Zhou family issued a settlement agreement and a promissory note, which were witnessed by lawyers Wang Chengkuan and Gu Yongquan, as well as the local guarantor. The land price was to be paid upon receipt. At that time, the Qu family handed over the land's deed and other documents to the Zhou family. However, after Zhou Jianren issued the agreement, he refused to pay. Qu Shenshi, along with her son Qu Shunxiang, filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Local Court against Zhou Jianren for privately digging up the ancestral tomb, stealing and selling the land, requesting the return of the coffins, and requesting punishment according to the law. Prosecutor Liu Pingfan ordered Zhou Jianren to be summoned to the case and ordered him to post bail and indict the case to the Criminal Court. The indictment stated that the cemetery was claimed by both the Zhou and Qu families as their family property. In April of this year, the Zhou family sold the land to the Lu family. When the Qu family learned of this, they tried to stop it. Zhou then asked someone to go to the Qu family to smooth things over, saying that after the land was sold, he would give the Qu family a certain amount of money to allow the sale. The Qu family agreed and signed a settlement agreement, and Zhou issued a promissory note. Unexpectedly, after Zhou Jianren sold the land, he did not pay the Qu family the money he owed. The ancestral tombs of the Qu family on this land were also dug up by Zhou Jianren. Zhou Jianren committed the crimes of defrauding property, stealing, selling, and excavating graves, violating Articles 363, 337, and 264 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday was the date for the public hearing of this case. At 10:00 AM, Criminal Court Judge Shen Bingrong specially opened the Fifth Court for the trial. Chen Kuitang, the lawyer retained by the plaintiff Qu Shunxiang, appeared in court to prosecute the private suit. The defendant Zhou Jianren retained lawyer Ye Fukan to defend him. According to the defendant Zhou Jianren's statement, he is 27 years old, from Shanghai, lives at No. 396 Fangbang Road, and works as a teacher at Minli Middle School. The cemetery is actually my family's ancestral tomb. My father and I have never mortgaged it to anyone. (Asked) When was the cemetery sold, and what was the price? (Answer) This year during Qingming Festival, it was sold to Lu Youyuan for his business, and the price was 16,300 yuan. (Asked) Since the land belongs to you, why did the Qu family interfere? (Answer) When I received the deposit, I asked the local guarantor Yu Bingchen to collect the draft deed. Yu said that the Qu family was now involved because they held a substitute deed and other documents. But in the past, my father (referring to Zhou Juping) had litigated with the Qu family. Now my relative Zhang Shousan came forward to mediate. Since the land had obtained a good price, he advised me to pay some money. The Qu family wanted 6,200 yuan. When the agreement was signed, I went out due to business, so I entrusted my cousin Su Zuyan to represent me. (Asked) Is Zhou Guangyao's stamp on the settlement agreement yours? (Answer) Yes, I ordered Su to do it on my behalf. The money was to be paid when the land price was received. At this point, I noticed that the deed number submitted by the Qu family was No. 185, which was not worth this amount, and I also noticed that it was mortgaged twice in March and September of the third year of Tongzhi. I thought it was impossible to mortgage it twice in one year. I thought it was inconsistent, so I didn't pay. (Asked) Are there graves on the land? (Answer) There are eight ancestral coffins and bone boxes, etc. (Asked) Who is buried there? (Answer) I don't remember, but it was about six or seven generations ago. (Asked) Where are the coffins now moved to? (Answer) They are in the Jianding Guild Hall, which has eight bone boxes. (Asked) How do you recognize them? (Answer) I go to sweep the graves and worship every year according to the records. (Asked) Since you have evidence, why did you agree to them? (Answer) I was afraid that the deeds would be lost outside, causing problems in the future, so I signed the agreement, etc. The official ordered the plaintiff Qu Shunxiang to be brought to court to testify. He is 29 years old, from Shanghai, lives at No. 58 Father Lauson Road, and works in a yarn factory. (Asked) Who does the land at Zhaojia Archway on Dalin Road belong to? (Answer) It belongs to my family. It was mortgaged to the Lou family by my father in the thirtieth year of Guangxu. This time, I redeemed it. Because I was working in Tianjin, my relative Zhao Qiming represented me to redeem it. It has now been handed over to the Zhou family. There are six pieces of evidence, one substitute deed and five deeds. Swap the settlement agreement issued by the Zhou family. (Asked) What was the redemption price? (Answer) It was mortgaged for 300 yuan in the past, and now I redeemed it from the Lou family for 700 yuan in principal and interest. (Asked) Then this land has nothing to do with the Zhou family? (Answer) Yes. (Asked) Since it is your family's land, why didn't you sell it yourself, but the Zhou family sold it? (Answer) There was a lawsuit before. I found out that this land was bought by my father Qu Xianglin in the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu. My family has paid grain for eight years. (Asked) Who is buried on the land? (Answer) My great-great-grandfather, Duke Shunshan, and his wife Zhang; my great-grandfather, Duke Guoxiu, and his wife Gu; my great-grandfather Qingsong, and his wife He; my great-great-grandfather Defu, and his wife Tang, for a total of eight coffins. These coffins were moved from Tangjiawan to this place in the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu and buried, and there were circle boards. When the Zhou family dug up the grave this time, I was in Tianjin. After my mother Qu Shenshi found out, she originally intended to sue, but Zhang Shousan was persuaded by the Zhou family to come forward to mediate and was willing to pay 6,200 silver dollars. My mother agreed, etc. The judge obtained the statement and then asked Zhou Jianren, (Asked) Are there circle boards in the grave? Zhou (Answer) No. The judge said, the two sides can't blindly snatch and recognize ancestors. (Answer) I am a teacher and don't tell lies, etc. Next, Zhao Qiming testified, 48 years old, lives on Father Lauson Road, cotton industry. (Asked) What is your relationship with the Qu family? (Answer) Cousin. (Asked) Who does the land on Dalin Road belong to? (Answer) It belongs to the Qu family. (Asked) How do you know? (Answer) All the gentlemen in Shanghai know this. My father told me about it. It was mortgaged to Lou Guisheng in the thirtieth year of Guangxu. It was redeemed on April 30 this year. At that time, after the conditions for reconciliation with the Zhou family were agreed upon, I represented them to redeem it. (Asked) Where does Lou live? (Answer) I don't know where he lives, but I know that it is Fengtai Customs Brokerage on Jiangxi Road. On May 4, Qu Shenshi and others handed me this draft deed and delivered it to lawyers Wang Chengkuan and Gu Yongquan at Dafugui Restaurant inside Dazhongmen. Zhou issued a settlement agreement. (Asked) The Qu family is so nice. (Answer) Qu Shunxiang is in Tianjin. Qu's mother, Qu Shenshi, told me that after the Zhou family dug up the grave, they took photos and prepared to sue. I tried my best to persuade them not to litigate. So the Zhou family asked Yu Bingchen, Zhang Shousan, etc., to come forward to mediate, etc. Then, Yu Bingchen testified, 47 years old, local, lives at No. 55 Gujia Lane, is the local guarantor for the Tenth Tu of the Twenty-Fifth Bao. (Asked) Is Dalin Road in your jurisdiction? (Answer) Local guarantor for the Tenth Tu of the Twenty-Fifth Bao. (Asked) The land at Dalin Road used to belong to the Qu family. The litigation has not ended since the former Qing Dynasty. (Asked) Since it has not ended, how can the Zhou family sell it? (Answer) Qu Shenshi came to my house and said about the Zhou family's sale of the land. At that time, the land had not yet been moved. (Asked) Who owns it? (Answer) I don't know. At this point, the lawyer Chen, hired by the plaintiff, stood up and said, please ask the court to order the clerk Liu Shixi to come to court to prove the truth. Judge Shen said that there will be no debate today. Listen to the testimony and set a date for a joint hearing.</p>
<h3>Criminals Ingeniously Use the Plan of Escaping Like a Cicada Shedding Its Skin</h3>
<p>Delivering a Paper Package with an Unchanged Expression</p>
<p>Exchanging Copper Coins and Disappearing Like a Yellow Crane</p>
<p>Around 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, Officer Ye of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei led several police officers to inspect pedestrians in the area around Mongolia Road and the Xin Xin Stage. At that time, a certain Mr. Jia came by rickshaw, holding a paper package in his hand, which looked quite neat. The police ordered the rickshaw driver to stop and asked Mr. Jia to get off the rickshaw and open the package for inspection. Unexpectedly, Mr. Jia was very alert, his expression unchanged. Hearing this, he handed the paper package to the police officers and said, "I'm going to exchange copper coins to pay the rickshaw fare. You can return it after you've checked it." The police officers believed him and opened the paper package to inspect it. They saw about ten squares, the size of copper coins. On closer inspection, the patterns were very fine and were copper plates for printing counterfeit banknotes from a certain bank. By the time they wanted to chase after him, Mr. Jia had already disappeared like a yellow crane. So they took the copper plates along with the rickshaw driver Liu Yu'en to the station. After Director Yao's preliminary questioning, he was sent to the Judicial Section for handling.</p>
<h3>It Really Was a Minor Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Wu Xiao-Sizi, the Kidnapped Child, is Found</p>
<p>Wu Guisheng, from Yancheng, runs the Shunxing Restaurant at No. 8 Oil Mill Wharf in the Nanshi area. His wife, Zhang, is 45 years old, and they have a son named Xiao-Sizi, who is only four years old. Wu and his wife had this child late in life and cherish him dearly. A relative, Chen Huanwen, from Bao Ying, often visits Wu's place. On the morning of the 22nd of this month, around 8 a.m., Chen came to Wu's house, took Xiao-Sizi in his arms to play outside the door, while Mrs. Wu carried a basket to the market to buy vegetables. When she returned to the restaurant, both Chen and her son were gone. They suspected Chen was not a good person and had likely kidnapped the child. Mrs. Wu immediately asked her sister's husband, Zhao Pinhua, and others to rush to Yang Ruixian's place, a relative of Chen's in Yinhua Lane, Xiaoshadu, north of Shanghai, to inquire. Unfortunately, Yang was out. They returned at 10 p.m. that night when Yang had returned home but was packing his bags, ready to leave. Zhao and the others became suspicious and questioned him about Chen's whereabouts, but he refused to reveal anything. After they explained that Chen had kidnapped a child and threatened to report him if he didn't reveal Chen's location, Yang became frightened and finally confessed that Chen was living at No. 12 near the Yingrui Temple in Zhoujiaqiao. Knowing they had a lead, Zhao and the others restrained Yang while sending someone to inform Wu to report to the First Precinct, First Sub-station, requesting the police to investigate the kidnapping of his young son. The police dispatched a chief officer to rush to the location around 1 a.m. yesterday, with Yang accompanying them to identify the place. Upon arrival, they stormed inside and found Chen, a man, and a woman lying on the floor, with the child Xiao-Sizi also sleeping there. All were immediately arrested and taken back to the police station. During the preliminary interrogation by the station chief, Chen confessed that he was 22 years old and used to make cattail mats in his hometown. During the Qingming Festival, his wife eloped with someone to Shanghai, so he came to Shanghai with his mother-in-law to find her, staying at his wife's brother Yang Ruixian's place in Yinhua Lane. After searching for a long time without success, he ran out of money and found it difficult to make ends meet. So, Yang suggested that he go to the house of his wife's uncle, Wu Guisheng, and try to kidnap his four-year-old son in order to write a letter demanding a ransom. He agreed, and then asked his friend Jiang Wenxuan to rent a house to hide the kidnapped child. However, their plan was discovered. Yang confessed that he was a rickshaw puller and that his mother was eager to return home, but he lacked travel expenses. Therefore, he instructed Chen to carry out the kidnapping. After taking Wu's young son, they were about to write a letter to the father demanding a ransom when they were caught. The man confessed that his name was Jiang Wenxuan and that his friends Chen Huanwen and Yang Ruixian asked him to rent a house. He found No. 12 Yingrui Temple and made it clear that the rent was two and a half yuan, which Yang paid. But he really didn't know they were hiding a kidnapped child. The woman confessed that her name was Yang Wang, and she had been involved with Yang Ruixian for three years. This time, Yang and the others rented a house to hide the kidnapped child and feared that others would become suspicious, so they asked her to watch the place. The station chief, considering the importance of the case involving the kidnapping of a young child with the intent to demand a ransom, ordered a written report to be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Three Hundred Yuan in Banknotes: One Hundred Stolen, Two Hundred Burned</h3>
<p>A Seaman's Nervous Breakdown</p>
<p>His Stupidity is Beyond Compare</p>
<p>A Russian engineer at the Shanghai Municipal Council, Enxin Fei Qiu, lived at No. 26 Zhapu Road and employed a seaman from Shandong named Liu Shunan. One morning, around 8 a.m., while the Russian went to the bureau to handle business, Liu saw a key left on the table in the bedroom. Liu opened the drawer and found thirty ten-yuan banknotes from the Bank of China, totaling three hundred yuan. Liu stole one hundred yuan, ten bills, and put them in his pocket. Fearing that the owner would return and investigate, he burned the remaining two hundred yuan to ashes, put them back in the drawer, closed it, put the key back in its original place, and thought he could rest easy. He even gave the stolen one hundred yuan to a friend to take to Nanjing. However, his nervous breakdown led to a mishap. In the afternoon, when Enxin returned home after work, he opened the drawer and was shocked. Only half of the banknotes were burned, and he could still count them. Enxin counted and found that ten banknotes were missing. He reported the information to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent a Chinese detective, Shen Dehui, to investigate. He knew it was someone in the household. At that time, Liu also looked terrified. He was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Sixth Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer presented the case, and the plaintiff, Enxin Fei Qiu, explained the situation. When questioned, the defendant denied the charges. After Judge Luo Renji examined the confession, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, and the hearing was adjourned for further questioning after summoning witnesses.</p>
<h3>Nie Gela Comes to Shanghai to Perform</h3>
<p>A Public Performance Today Afternoon on the Bund</p>
<p>The American magic master Nie Gela, with his divine skills, has won the honor of "King of all Magicians" in Europe and America.

In another scene, Nie can stretch a woman's limbs extremely long and then shrink them extremely short. In short, the magic that Nie can perform is his own patented product and cannot be learned by others. Now, in order to make outsiders believe in his divine skills, Nie will give a public demonstration of his secret escape method at 5:15 p.m. today on the Bund of Nanjing Road.

<p>Han Chupin Falls, Shatters His Skull and Dies a Tragic Death</p>
<p>Han Chupin, a Ningbo native who worked at a sugar store on Yanghang Street outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, was 23 years old this year. Recently, he suffered from typhoid fever and felt hot and stuffy in bed. The day before yesterday evening, he got up and went to the window to cool off.

<p>The Company Provides a Compensation of Two Hundred and Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>The British-American Tramway Company's tram B28, at 12:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, was traveling east to west on Avenue Road when a worker, Zhou Junnan, was also traveling in the same direction. As the tram approached Seymour Road and was about to stop, Zhou suddenly crossed the road in front of the tram and was hit and killed.

<p>Jailer, chatting with a criminal about to be sentenced to death: Your case is about to be decided. You can't escape the death penalty. But I don't know which way of dying you prefer.</p>
<p>Criminal: There are many ways to die. Tell me about some of them.</p>
<p>Jailer: For example, shooting, beheading, hanging, etc. Which one do you think is good?</p>
<p>Criminal: I think it's best to wait decades and die of old age. That's the most natural.</p>
<p>A: I heard a philosopher say that humans are made of clay. I don't know if that's true.</p>
<p>B: Very true, very true. So the white people of the West are made of white clay, and the yellow people of the East are made of yellow clay.</p>
<p>A: Then the black people of the Negro are?</p>
<p>B: They're probably made of coal ash.</p>
<p>Widow (going to the insurance company to collect her husband's death benefit): Sir, my husband died of an epidemic. Please calculate the amount I should receive for his insurance.</p>
<p>Benevolent clerk: Poor Madam. You've suffered such a great loss. You must be heartbroken.</p>
<p>Widow: Nothing else, but don't you feel heartbroken that you are paying out this money for nothing?</p>
<h3>An Interesting Play: Mistaking the Owner for a Thief, Gong Yu</h3>
<p>A Mr. Chen lives in a house in Shanghai. Besides his mother and wife, he has seven children and a maid. Therefore, he rents out the small pavilion room to a Mr. Li, who is from the same hometown, and he lives in the rest of the house. Chen is from Shaoxing. Recently, because his wife's younger sister was getting married, his in-laws invited his wife and Chen back to their hometown. Chen's late father also happened to have his tenth anniversary. His mother wanted to return to her hometown to perform Buddhist rites, so the whole family returned to their hometown at the beginning of the month. His home in Shaoxing was originally a prominent family, with many uncles and brothers. Chen also had two younger brothers who worked locally, one of whom was married with children, so his mother wanted to return quickly to perform the Buddhist rites. Chen only stayed in his hometown for three days. Matters in Shanghai were pressing, so he couldn't stay longer. He didn't even wait for his wife's younger sister's wedding date before returning to Shanghai. The house, which used to be bustling, was now silent. Fortunately, there was still a tenant, which relieved the loneliness a little. However, Li had no family. During the day, both Chen and Li went out to work, and no one was guarding the house. Therefore, they had no choice but to lock the door, each carrying a key, so they could open it at any time. Chen's job was better, and he rested early, leaving work at 5 p.m. Li had to finish his work at 8 p.m. before having dinner and returning home. On the 16th, Chen had other business and returned home a little later. He saw the main door wide open and assumed that Li had returned. However, he blamed Li for being careless and not closing the doors. When he went upstairs, the lights were on. He suddenly saw boxes and suitcases scattered all over the floor and was shocked. He called out to Li, but there was no response. After a brief inspection, he found that all the valuable clothes were gone. After Chen's wife left, all the boxes and suitcases were locked. Now, none of them had been broken open. It was clearly a sign that a thief had visited. He staggered downstairs. Just as he reached the middle of the stairs, he suddenly encountered two patrolmen. Seeing Chen's panicked demeanor, they suspected he was the thief. One patrolman stretched out his huge palm and grabbed his arm. The force was so strong that his arm trembled with pain. He lost his senses and didn't know how to explain. He struggled to escape. The patrolmen mistook his actions as an attempt to escape and tightened their grip, raising his other hand to slap Chen's cheek while cursing. They dragged him downstairs. The other patrolman came to assist, pushing him from left and right. Chen really felt like a criminal. When they reached the living room, one patrolman was responsible for guarding, while the other planned to go upstairs to inspect. At that moment, Li arrived breathless and was shocked by what he saw. When Chen saw Li, his senses returned. He cried out, "What's going on?" Li said, "There was a theft at home, so I reported it to the police." The two patrolmen were stunned for a moment. They asked Chen, "Are you not the thief?" Chen said, "I am the owner of this house. How could I be a thief?" The two patrolmen realized they had made a mistake and apologized repeatedly. Because Chen's family had left Shanghai and there was no one at home during the day, the thief took the opportunity to visit. When Li returned home, the thief had already left fully loaded. He quickly asked for help from patrolmen on the street. Chen happened to return at the same time. Li accompanied the two patrolmen, but they walked a little behind, resulting in this unbelievable and interesting drama. The coincidence in the world could not be greater than this. Told by my friend Mr. Liang.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Shanghai Performing Arts Association Welcoming Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Performing Arts Association held a grand welcome tea party at its clubhouse in Nine Acres the day before yesterday to celebrate Mei Lanfang's triumphant return from performing in the United States. Several hundred people attended. They were seated at 4 p.m. Mr. Mei and his fellow performers arrived on time. First, the representative of the Performing Arts Association gave a welcome speech, saying, "Director Mei Wan-hua of the Peking Opera Troupe has the talent to reach the peak of perfection and the ambition to be great. He traveled across the ocean to study the arts of the New World in order to improve Chinese opera. At the same time, he introduced Chinese opera to foreign countries, causing a sensation throughout America and earning a global reputation. This is an unprecedented initiative in China's thousands of years of history, opening a new record of unparalleled glory in the history of the performing arts. After Mr. Mei returns to Peking, he will surely have a grand plan to reform Chinese opera. Taking advantage of Mr. Mei's passing through Shanghai on his way back to China, the members of the Shanghai Performing Arts Association have specially held a meeting to welcome him, to fulfill the friendship of the host. We hope that Mr. Mei will not despise our humble beginnings and will teach us about his experiences on this trip in order to broaden our knowledge and increase our wisdom. It is fortunate for the performing arts world and fortunate for China." Then, Mr. Zhou Xinfang gave a speech about the similarities and differences between Chinese and foreign theatrical arts and the impact of modern trends of thought on drama, tracing the origins and flowing to the ends, for a systematic and thorough study. His words were very insightful. Finally, Mr. Mei and Mr. Li Feishu gave replies separately. Mr. Mei's reply is attached below. The meeting ended at about 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's Reply</p>
<p>Distinguished guests, I am very grateful to the members of your association for welcoming me when I went to the United States and for hosting me again today on my return. I went to the United States this time and stayed for six months, performing in five places: New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu. Although I was not able to fully promote our Chinese opera, the results were very satisfactory in terms of the Westerners' reviews of Chinese opera.</p>
<p>During my time in the United States, I was very busy with social events and performances, so I was not able to investigate the situation of Western drama in detail. However, I did take a simple look. Although I didn't see much, I was already very impressed and envious.</p>
<p>In recent years, our Chinese opera scene has really been unable to recover. Especially in the drama itself, it is gradually declining. No one is creating anything new, and no one is preserving anything old. This is very dangerous. In the West, whether it's new or old, people take it very seriously. And they often have new things coming out. We should quickly learn from their creative spirit.</p>
<p>There are many good things in our Chinese opera. This time in the United States, Americans took it very seriously. So I hope that all my comrades in the country will quickly preserve it. At the same time, we should also organize it so that it can meet the needs of modern people.</p>
<p>When I left the United States this time, the Americans all saw me off and hoped that more of my comrades in the country would go. So I hope that all of you comrades will work together to make efforts for Chinese opera and transport more Chinese art to the West. I am also very willing to help you plan.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I am reminded that the unity of the Chinese theatrical world is too weak. This greatly hinders the progress of our theatrical future and, like many comrades overseas, should have considerable maintenance and promotion. Therefore, I hope at today's grand meeting that all the comrades in the Chinese theatrical world will quickly unite and organize a unified national organization to seek progress in our drama and benefits in our lives. This is the most important thing I hope for from my comrades in the theatrical world after my trip to the United States.</p>
<p>Today, I have a lot to talk about with you, but I can't finish it in a short time. So, I won't say it today. I just hope that there will be opportunities to talk in detail next time, so that I can realize the many important things I hope for in the Chinese theatrical world. Thank you today.</p>
<p>When I was in San Francisco, there were many comrades in the Cantonese opera world. When I arrived there, it was like being with family. We were very happy to see each other and gathered several times. They ran tens of thousands of miles. Their spirit and perseverance are really admirable.</p>

<p>Correction: The title of yesterday's "Origin of the Pen Club" was mistakenly "Pen Record Meeting." This is corrected.</p>
<h3>Origin of the Pen Club (Continued)</h3>
<p>The above is a general overview of the Pen Club. It has been less than ten years since its establishment, but it has already discovered many useful and important things that can be done. There are even greater hopes for the future. Our clear intention in launching the organization of the Chinese Pen Club is, of course, that our writers can have a friendly connection with writers all over the world and enjoy the various conveniences that come with it. But we also have a perhaps deeper intention. That is, we have been somewhat disheartened by the phenomenon of division and even antagonism and revenge among the domestic literary circles in recent years. The organization of this Pen Club may create a neutral regulatory force. The so-called prejudices and misunderstandings between various factions may be eliminated by this. A more correct literary task may be reminded by this. We need only look at the membership lists of pen clubs in various places and the reports of the pen clubs to know the function of the pen club. In his seat, not only sit the writers of Germany, Austria, France, and Belgium (when the European war hatred has not yet disappeared). At the same time, writers who disagree on the proposition are happy to get together. Isn't Henri Barbusse a rather leftist writer? He is a member of the Pen Club. Isn't Gorky an old and not "outdated" writer? He is a member of the Pen Club. In England, aren't Rupert Brooke and H.G. Wells standing in front of the era's thoughts? They and conservative or "right-wing" writers alike happily joined the activities of the Pen Club. These examples should make our so-called factions of writers broaden their minds. Let us at least have the opportunity to have a friendly gathering with each other on this matter from time to time. At least on this matter, we can temporarily put aside all the "differences" and "discrepancies." This may save a lot of energy in the unnecessary struggles with each other. Wouldn't it be better to move to a more humane career? During the European War, the soldiers on both sides of the confrontation often climbed out of the trenches during the rest period. They exchanged gifts with each other, lit matches to smoke together, and spoke like partners and brothers. Although in the next hour, they may be commanded by their superiors to use merciless artillery fire to destroy each other. A poet wrote in one of his poems that a lost island flew to hell to sing his song. This song not only reminded the ghosts in dark confinement of the light and scenery of their former lives, but also</p>
<p>SOMEONE THERE STOLE FORTH A HAND</p>
<p>TO DRAW HIS BROTHER TO HIS SIDE</p>
<p>These days, we only feel that the darkness and terror around us are getting thicker day by day. Can there be light in the future? Is it really necessary for everything to fall into darkness before we can realize the preciousness of light? Is it necessary to have hatred and resentment like swords and halberds filled in the fortress of humanity before we can realize that we are all from the same root? It's too late then.</p>
<p>Now, we, the undersigned initiators of the Chinese branch of the Pen Club, humbly and sincerely invite domestic writers to join. Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, Hu Shih, Zeng Mengpu, Ye Gongchuo, Zong Baihua, Xu Zhimo, Ge Gongzhen, Xie Shoukang, Lin Yutang, Zheng Zhenduo, Shao Xunmei, Tang Yulu, Guo Youshou. [The rest is unreadable] and many comrades overseas should have considerable maintenance and promotion. Therefore, I hope at today's grand meeting that all the comrades in the Chinese theatrical world will quickly unite and organize a unified national organization to seek progress in our drama and benefits in our lives. This is the most important thing I hope for from my comrades in the theatrical world after my trip to the United States.</p>
<p>When I was in San Francisco, there were many comrades in the Cantonese opera world. When I arrived there, it was like being with family. We were very happy to see each other and gathered several times. They ran tens of thousands of miles. Their spirit and perseverance are really admirable.</p>

<h3>Warmth in the Heart (240) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 13: Who Unintentionally Sows Blessings and Finds a Ring? Only This Fate Can Sing of Golden Threads with Heart</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen adopted a silent attitude at this time. Long Ziyun was also coldly observing people there. The little girl was running lively on the grass. In an instant, even Ruiyun disappeared. Long Ziyun said, "I haven't seen her for a year, and she has grown so much." Zuo Shichen also nodded, saying nothing. Long Ziyun continued, "Married life must be very good, right?" Zuo Shichen said, "I heard she has already become a mother." Long Ziyun said, "Really? 'Green leaves become shade, branches full of children,' I should recite that for her." Zuo Shichen said, "Girls grow up quickly. A cute little girl, after a few years, becomes a young woman who gradually understands love. A few more years, and she actually becomes a mother. In fact, time passes in the blink of an eye." Long Ziyun said, "But after this, one enters old age. Actually, it's only these few years, like flowers on a branch. Once they have fully bloomed and are satisfied, they either wither or fall." The place where Zuo Shichen was sitting had Ruiyun and her group of female companions behind him, but he was facing Long Ziyun. Behind Long Ziyun was a clump of green bamboo. This clump of green bamboo extended out, as if forming a screen for that patch of grass. Outside the green bamboo, there was a walkway. Through the swaying bamboo shadows, one could see the lanterns dotted along the walkway, and the various electric lights installed. While Zuo Shichen and Long Ziyun were talking, they suddenly heard a little girl's voice from within the green bamboo behind Gong Ziyun, calling out, "Fourth Sister, Sixth Sister, can you see me?" It turned out to be the little girl that Ruiyun was with, who had already circled from the grass to the walkway outside the bamboo forest. They were just walking casually, but even in the dappled bamboo shadows, one could see the figures on the grass. Ruiyun peeked out from a gap in the bamboo and said with a smile to the little girl, "Little Miss, can you see them from here? Fourth Miss and Sixth Miss are talking." That little girl, holding onto a green bamboo pole, shouted loudly, not knowing that the place was directly behind where Long Ziyun was sitting, and opposite where Zuo Shichen was sitting. This clearly meant that Ruiyun had circled outside the bamboo forest, to spy on Zuo Shichen. Zuo Shichen, however, was separated by a vast Xiaoxiang River, unable to see her clearly. He thought she still had that mischievous nature. After a while, she returned to the grass, smiling. But at that moment, the fireworks began. This patch of grass had already broken the silence, and was filled with noise. Several attendants, wanting to ingratiate themselves with the tea drinkers, all said that the position over there was good and you could clearly see the fireworks, and asked if they wanted to move over there. The female companions and children naturally liked watching fireworks, so they moved over there one after another. A waiter also came to Long Ziyun and asked if she wanted to move over there. Zuo Shichen said, "There's nothing to see in the fireworks. Let's take a walk elsewhere and then go back."</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Worsening</h3>
<p>Ten Taels of Fluctuation All Day</p>
<p>Resulting in a Fall of Four Taels and Six Mace</p>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Turmoil Expands: Yesterday, Margin Gold Prices Fell Repeatedly. The morning market was relatively stable, fluctuating only one or two taels. The afternoon market suddenly weakened, and the falling trend began abruptly. The raging torrents were extremely fierce, even breaking through the 590 tael mark. It is rumored that the Japanese cabinet is shaking, and the turmoil is expanding. Market conditions are deteriorating, and people are panicked. Throughout the day, there were fluctuations of more than ten taels. Foreign exchange weakened from flat. There were strong selling intentions among fellow traders. Companies such as Fuchang, Tianxiang, Dakang, Wanxing, and Tianyuyong all sold. Zhifengyong, Taifengcheng, and Dadecheng had irregular inflows and outflows. Hengxing, Taikangrun, Yuanmaoyong, and others all bought in. Since the morning market silver price did not change, the buying interest was still strong, and the market opened high. Afterwards, there were slight advances and retreats, hovering between 93 and 94 taels. Later, most of the firms sold heavily, and at first it was peaceful. Subsequently, news of the Japanese political turmoil spread, and the foreign exchange also loosened. Conditions worsened, and the falling trend was irresistible, plummeting seven or eight taels, suddenly falling below 585 taels. In the end, it seemed to turn peaceful, but the final price was still only 585 taels and some change. Yesterday, the large bar was slightly longer by one-sixteenth. The silver price remained the same as before.</p>
<p>Morning Opened High: The September opening rose by 2.8 mace, reaching 592.8 taels. The rough price continued to rise by more than one tael, reaching 94 taels. Hengxing and others did not slacken in their buying interest. The near-term Japanese gold Mitsui and others absorbed 1.333 taels, and the next month's price was 1.3275 taels. When the preliminary order was announced, the listed price did not move, and then it rose again to 94.67 mace. Subsequently, Fuchang and others sold. As for the near-term English gold, it was sold by Mitsui and Hefeng to Shiye Xingye for 6 pence and 25. At 10:00, the price was 92.8 taels. Later, the Korean market bought ready deliveries from Dalian for 1.333125 taels, and zero traders also submitted slips, pushing the price up by more than one tael. At 10:30, the price was 94.5 taels, but the selling positions surged, and the exchange rate weakened. Only 1.32875 taels were available for sale for ready delivery in Dalian, and English gold was also scarce. October deliveries could be transacted at 6.4375 pence, and people became nervous, leading to a gradual decline. Until 11:45, the price fell to around 92 taels. In a moment, it rose a few cash, to 2.6 taels, as the bulls closed out their positions, but the noon closing price was still 92.2 taels. The announced price was still 652.2 taels. The initial press was 57 or 58 taels, and the noon closing was suppressed by nearly 60 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Fell Sharply: The afternoon market opened at 91.8 taels. Buyers did not slacken, adding up to 93 taels. Before long, sellers in the market rose up bravely, and English gold also softened. October deliveries could be settled at 6.5 pence. The atmosphere worsened suddenly. Yu Da, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Yuxing Yong, Bingxing, and others all rushed to sell, simply because they heard that the Japanese political turmoil was tense. Forced by the environment, the price plummeted six or seven taels, and at 3:30 it suddenly dropped to 86 or 87 taels. The waves were滔天, but Hengxing's entries and exits were uncertain, sometimes rising or falling by one or two taels. Then it depreciated again by two or three taels, suddenly reaching 84.2 taels. Hedgers advanced slightly, turning up two taels. After 4:15, the price was 86.12 mace. However, at 4:30, the market closed at 585.4 taels, falling by 4.6 taels compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the two markets was 94.7 taels, and the minimum price was 84.2 taels, with a fluctuation of 10.5 taels. The exchange registered the accounts twice in the morning and afternoon, as usual. The morning market was from 91 taels to 92 taels, and the afternoon market was from 85 taels to 86 taels, a difference of six taels. The margin call was from 91 taels to 85 taels. The opening price of goods in the morning was 92.9 taels, the noon closing was 2 taels, the afternoon was 2 taels, and the closing price was 84.8 taels.</p>
<p>Market Supply Exceeds Demand: The transactions of each firm showed that Hengxing, Shengda, Taikangrun, Jindayong, Yuanmaoyong, and Fuxingyong all bought in. Wanxing, Shunli, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, and Yuancheng Yong had uncertain inflows and outflows. Fuchang, Dakang, Yuanda, Fuyu, and Tianxiang all sold. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong and Hengxing sometimes had supply and demand. Yu Da, Yuxing Yong, Bingxing, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Yuanmaoyong, Sencheng Yong, and Taikangrun all sold. Wanxing and Shunli bought in. In short, supply exceeded demand, and the market atmosphere was panicky. The Dalian gang had more demand than supply, buying in about 1700 or 1800 bars and selling out more than 900 bars. The Guangdong gang bought in first and then sold out, but the entries and exits of customer slips were complex and chaotic.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Increasingly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed prices for foreign exchange showed no changes except for an increase of 25 in the exchange rate for India, calculated at 101 rupees. Although the price of large silver bars rose repeatedly, the amount was very small and had no impact. The domestic market was still stable in the morning but seemed to loosen later. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall of margin gold by 10 taels, it also weakened. Most Chinese speculators dumped their holdings. Approximately 200,000 pounds of English gold were transacted, and interbank transactions amounted to 100,000 pounds. Gold firms sold more than 100,000 pounds. These were taken in by Huabi, Macary, Zhengjin, Anda, etc. Macary also sold a few tens of thousands of pounds. Sino-Japanese and other banks conducted several million yuan worth of transactions in US dollars. The Dalian gang sold Japanese exchange worth one million to several tens of thousands of yuan to Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Taiwan, Korea, Sumitomo, etc. After being silent for many days, it seemed to show activity yesterday. As a result, the price of each exchange rate increased by 125 for English gold and 25 for US dollars compared to the previous day, while Japanese gold fell by 1.5 points. The market atmosphere weakened, and the sentiment turned bearish.</p>
<p>English Exchange: The domestic market fluctuated by 125. In the morning, the selling price for July and August was 1 shilling and 6 pence 25, the selling price for September was 3125, and the selling price for October was 375. The buying price added 0625. Mitsui and Hefeng conducted 20,000 pounds of July transactions with Shiye Xingye at a price of 25. Macary and Shanghai jointly conducted 10,000 pounds of October transactions at a price of 4375. The noon closing price for July and August was 3125, and the price for October was 4375. In the afternoon, Macary and Huabi jointly conducted 10,000 pounds of October transactions at a price of 4375. Macary sold 5,000 at a price of 6.5 pence. Huabi, Zhengjin, and Anda bought 230,000 pounds of October deliveries at a price of 6.5 pence. Macary also bought 5,000 at the same price. By the closing, the selling price for July and August was 375, and the price for October was 6.5 pence. The buying price still added 0625.</p>

<p>East Exchange: The domestic market fluctuated by more than one point, and the swap was from 25 to 125, seemingly approaching, because July was coming to an end. From the morning, the selling price for July was 1 tael 3 mace 3 fen 5, the buying price was 1 tael 3 mace 3 fen, the selling price for October was 1 tael 3 mace 3 fen, and the buying price was 1 tael 3 mace 2 fen 5.

<h3>Foreign Cents Show Mixed Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, the sultry heat is蒸人, and the morale of the people and the market is depressed. In addition, many peers are short of funds and there is some competition. Therefore, the difference between the cent prices in the morning and afternoon markets is very large. However, this is still a normal transaction, and has no relationship with the future of the cent price, unlike brisk sales that can be discussed on the same day.</p>
<p>Cent Exchange Rate: "Foreign Cents" The morning market suddenly showed sluggishness, and the cent price fell by more than one cent, to 7 mace 2 fen 7 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, which was 1 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half lower than the morning market of the previous day. The afternoon market suddenly rebounded to 7 mace 2 fen 8 li and a half, resulting in a slight decrease of 2 hao and a half compared to the previous morning. The ups and downs between morning and afternoon have already resulted in considerable wear and tear. "One Silver Exchange" Both the morning and afternoon markets opened at four fen, which was one or two fen weaker than the previous day. The bank's listed price had no market, and the scratch head remained white throughout.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The Jiangnan Small Foreign Coin was 6 mace 3 fen 2 li in the morning market and 6 mace 3 fen 1 li in the afternoon market, resulting in a slight decrease of one li compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 3,000 jiao in the morning market and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong Small Foreign Coin was 6 mace 1 fen 3 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half in the morning market and 6 mace 1 fen 3 li 2 hao and a half in the afternoon market, resulting in a slight decrease of 2 li 7 hao and a half. The trading volume was 125,000 jiao in the morning market and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins suddenly increased by 5,000 wen, to 386,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" The news of bank collections and settlements was particularly light. Chinese merchants collected and settled over 1.4 million in bills.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Show Slight Tightening</h3>
<p>The yarn market is relatively firm. Although overseas cotton yarn consistently trends downward, the local market has not been affected much, and has instead shown resilience. This is because buyers are tightening their grip and refusing to loosen it. The sales of 10-count coarse yarn are good. The Xuzhou gang is absorbing large quantities of next month's coarse yarn, which is also speculative. In addition, the approach of the end of the month means that there are more scattered short-sellers, so the market is tightening. The rise in the current month is pulling up the distant month.</p>
<p>Human Standard First Fell Then Rose: The market opened in the morning, and the sentiment was very weak due to the discovery of new prices for American cotton. Fortunately, the sellers in the market were not strong, and each month only fell by three or four cash. Slightly more than half of the two or three sellers were short-sellers, and they rebounded slightly. The result was flat. The market became stronger in the afternoon, and each month rose by four, five, six, seven, and eight cash. The total transaction volume for the day was 6,050 bales. Yicheng sold 800 bales, the most. Yu Da, Senkang, Qinfeng, Lichang, and Shen sold between 200 and 800 bales. Maoji, Tianlong, Taichang, Deji, Yantai, Xiesheng, Yiyu Yichang Taixing bought between 200 and 400 bales. The closing prices of the human standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Coarse Yarn Factory Opens 2,000 Bales: The sales of spot yarn are still good. Various gangs bought 950 bales. The Xuzhou gang bought 1,300 bales of futures. Counterparts bought 1,600 bales. The market was flat. Most of the buyers were from the Guangdong gang, totaling 475 bales. In addition, Shantou bought 150 bales, Niuzhuang bought 40 bales, the interior bought 125 bales, Xuzhou bought 50 bales, Wuhu bought 35 bales, and miscellaneous gangs bought 75 bales. Tongyi and Chongxin factories opened more than 2,000 bales of 10-count Golden Chicken Dafa.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Cotton Uniquely Rises by Four Mace</h3>
<p>The cotton market has been quite firm recently. In fact, there are too many scattered short-sellers. Once the market turns, the rebound is more dramatic. Although American cotton has frequently hit new low prices, the local cotton market has not been hit. Buyers are absorbing and increasing their holdings of old cotton from July and August, and it is rumored in the business community that there will be a high wave of squeezing in August, so buying interest is strong and the market is tightening. However, with foreign cotton trending lower, there are still many people selling distant-month positions, so the new cotton market is uniquely weak.</p>
<p>Han Standard Old Rises, New Falls: The Han Standard market opened in the morning. With American cotton breaking through the 13-cent mark again, people were panicked before the opening, and it was expected that there would be a fall of three or four mace. When it came to August, large accounts purchased, and the market became even tighter, rising by one cash. Distant months fell by one cash due to the influence of foreign cotton. As a result, the near-term rose by two cash, and the distant term fell by five points. In the afternoon, the near-month situation remained firm, rising another two cash, and the distant month fell by five points. The total transaction volume for the day was 57,100 dan. Heshen sold 3,500 dan, the most. In addition, Tianlong, Yongchang, Tongxing, Yongfeng, Daji, Hengde, Yilong, Deji, and Yuanda sold between 1,000 and 2,000 dan. Hengyi bought 3,100 dan, the most. Heshen, Yu Da, Tongxing, Yantai, Lichang, Jinfeng, Maoji, and Qinfeng bought between 1,400 and 2,800 dan. The closing prices of the Han Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Grain East New Japonica Rice Sees a Decline of Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Chen Bai Japonica Rice Plummets</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived from various routes, but sales remained sluggish. All goods fell sharply. Changbang white japonica rice was short by two or three jiao again. Currently, the special top-grade japonica rice has already entered within the 21st customs gate. East New japonica rice plummeted by half a yuan, with prices opening at 20 yuan, 0.05 to 0.3 jiao. This newspaper had earlier said that prices would be difficult to sustain, and now the downstream is indeed here. Xian rice sales are brisk, due to slightly more sales. The market continued to decline due to the decline in foreign rice. Bianyuan rice fell by four or five jiao, and the rebound was very sharp. It is observed that the high price of 18.5 yuan will probably need further adjustment. The river stock is thick throughout the day. All goods are declining due to slow sales.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Not many goods arrived from the river, and the outflow was very slow. Boat japonica rice and factory japonica rice sales were extremely brisk, with few entering households. Prices fell by about 0.3 yuan. Ordinary high-quality goods are already at the 20 yuan mark. The decline in medium and lower grades is even greater. Currently, broken rice has plummeted. Bo Dao goods are also slightly brisk. Purchases in this street are very weak, and prices are also falling gradually. The situation is very weak. Yang Du Jian follows foreign rice downstream. The market barely opens at around 19 yuan. Bai Yuan was initially flat, but then fell by two or three jiao due to the small report from the North Market. The market trend is unusually weak.</p>
<h3>Small Squeezed Coarse Rice Depreciates and Sells Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market continued to decline. The situation seemed to be in a state of collapse. Because the weather was suitable and the new rice and early rice would be on the market soon, the owners all had the desire to depreciate the price and sell. Yesterday, the price of each rice depreciated by a small number of jiao, and it was started by the Hangzhou gang and the local scattered households. A total of more than 10,000 bags were opened. The market was still active. Small squeezed coarse rice had a large inventory. The price fell to 10.05 yuan in the morning, but it was still difficult to sell well. In the afternoon, the price was reduced to 10.02 to 0.03 yuan, and it became active. More than 8,000 bags were opened. A total of about 5,000 bags of other white xian rice were opened. The price was also a little lower by about 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Small squeezed rice was 14.15 yuan, second to 13.5 yuan, large squeezed rice was 11.8 yuan, second to 11.55 yuan, second Saigon No. 2 was 13.05 yuan, Min Dang was 13.89 yuan, Kegai rice was 13.6 yuan, and small squeezed coarse rice was 0.04 to 0.05 yuan lower, it is said.</p>
<h3>Bulls Exit, Wheat Market Returns Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the current month's wheat futures were once squeezed, opening as high as 4 taels, 0.074 yuan, but the forward months remained stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, the bulls wanted to take the opportunity to sell, and the shorts' desire to cover was lax. Compared with the opening price in the morning, it was a few points softer. It was slightly heard that the bulls in the current month were actually customers from the mainland. Due to the huge losses, it was discovered that the delivery volume of this round of delivery did not meet the exchange's standards, so the final result must be to take in a few cars. As a result, the current month fell by 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day, August fell by 0.01 yuan, September fell by 0.02 yuan, October fell by 0.01 yuan, and November and December fell by 0.02 yuan. The factory appetite for spot wheat is still not good. High-quality goods are shouted up by 0.02 yuan because they still meet the factory's appetite. Medium and lower grades fell by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. This situation is still a situation of raising the price and killing the inferior goods. A total of more than 4,700 bags of wheat from Gaoyou, Shashi, Hankou, and Yizheng were opened and handled by Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Returns to Stability</h3>
<p>Factory Stable…Short-term Floating Shorts Cover</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the afternoon, each month generally returned to stability. The big and small factories were not prepared for the delivery at the end of the month, and it was heard that a certain factory's red order was more than the futures it sold, so the outside floating shorts had to gradually cover it, no longer waiting and seeing. In the remaining months, because the factory's attitude turned to stability and there were few sell-offs, the opening price of each month entered a firm state. Looking at the future situation, the factory's attitude is certain, and if there is no unexpected impulse, the market situation can be stabilized. As a result, the current month rebounded by 0.0125 yuan compared to the previous day, August and November were 0.015 yuan higher, September and December were 0.0075 yuan higher, and October was 0.01 yuan higher.</p>
<h3>Label Cakes Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the futures cakes was very good, because the floating shorts covered and the customers entered smoothly, the market rose steadily, and even jumped three or four points, reaching 0.01995 yuan. Compared with the shortest time at the beginning of the week, it actually covered a huge amount of 0.015 yuan. The huge rise and fall are rare. In the afternoon, the telegram to Shanghai was slightly flat, and a part of the bulls closed, causing it to fall slightly by about 0.01 yuan. The market closed at 0.0198 yuan. It is predicted that the next round of delivery this month will be huge.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea European and American Stockpilers Plan to Stockpile Period Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai local foreign Chiang silk market seemed to be active. It was found that European and American silk merchants planned to take the opportunity to stockpile because the silk price had fallen to the lowest limit, waiting for the demand of silk merchants. Although there was a European telegram to Shanghai yesterday, the price increase was very small. It is said that it is still difficult for Chinese silk merchants to agree to the negotiation because the cost of silk is not discussed.</p>
<h3>Shuang Gong Cocoon Prices Look Weak</h3>
<p>Since the new Shuang Gong cocoons were seen this year, the sales appetite in Europe and Japan has been sluggish, and the Shanghai Shuang Gong silk factories' intention to enter is also weak. The opening price is sluggish. Now that the silk factories are closed for summer vacation, the Shuang Gong cocoon factory is not moving. Only Richuang has slightly purchased. Yesterday, Harada entered Wuxi Shuang Gong cocoons for 80 dan, the price was only 50 taels, and the price is still looking weak, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Dabang American Sales Launched</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign village green tea market showed a slight activity. Wuyuan Dabang American sales have been launched. The opening price is from 55.5 taels to 60 taels, but the price is not good. The English village needs more high-village core-extracted Zhenmei. Tunxi Zhenmei also has some sales. The market association has already started to search for Gongxi. Chinese tea merchants are determined because of the huge sales volume and insufficient production of Russian Chiang, and they are unwilling to sell at a discount, it is said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Yuehua Velvet Rises 0.0025 Yuan</h3>
<p>The actual sales of piece goods are also quiet. Local customers do not have enthusiasm. Only the Ningbo gang is slightly active. About 200 pieces of Yuehua velvet were sold in the middle. Therefore, the price rose by 0.0025 yuan. Jilong, Fuhua, Wulu, etc. all have to sell for 0.018 yuan. Jinshan Temple, Qiji, Yang Guifei, 0.01775 yuan. In the afternoon, it suddenly became scarce. The Sichuan gang also added the big Yuehua velvet. The Big Jilong Yang Guifei are all asking for 0.019 yuan. The remaining such as cotton flannel, colored striped flannel, blue striped flannel, etc. are still not active. There are more spot goods of fine serge. The actual price of Erqiu is 0.02875 yuan, Huxinting 0.025 yuan, and Zijinshan 0.02475 yuan. Printed Zhigong Ni has also arrived in Shanghai one after another. The situation is no longer as good as before. Yuhuayuan opened at 0.031 yuan yesterday, Sun Meiren 0.0305 yuan. There is still a shortage of spot goods of Tu Yuan and Tu Ju. The Changjiang Gang added a lot of Xihuo's Fang Li Yuan Zhigong Ni yesterday, the price is 0.0235 yuan. Shangshen's Deji Yaqian Shu opened at 0.069 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Kobe Sugar Opened 5,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Rises to 0.81 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for coarse sand was still active. The transaction price was 0.81 taels, 20 medium sand white was 0.795 taels, and 12 Dutch red was 0.71 taels. Although there were not many transactions, the market was beautiful. Japanese sugar fell slightly, and there were not many transactions. Minghua YP Mark was 0.8225 taels, and Mark was 0.81 taels with a slight transaction. YL Mark was made at 0.0205 yuan, and YRO Mark was 0.7925 taels. All were rarely received. The Japanese sugar factory sold 5,000 bags of Kobe sugar,	LM Mark price was 0.059 taels, TK Mark was 0.063 taels, and TX Mark was 0.064 taels. All were new regulations plus tax. The original quota was 20,000 bags. Because each bag requires a deposit of 1 tael, few people inquired about it. The market had more than 100 bags of Binghua Qing opened, the price was still 0.82 taels. The price of Shanghai factory rock sugar rose by 0.01 yuan, calculated as Renzi Mark 0.1008 yuan, Ganzi 0.1006 yuan. Zhenxiang Company sold more than 2,000 bags of spot Dutch Red No. 8, the price was 0.0665 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.02 yuan compared to the original disk.
