<h3>工人難管（萬仰）</h3>
<p>工人難管，工人難管，這句口頭禪，流行於服務工廠同人的口中，也像鄉嫗念阿彌陀佛，念得爛聽得熟了。如果具此觀念，來管工人，工人當然難管了。</p>
<p>大凡工人的工作，决不是有心拆爛汚，苦于沒有人統率，沒有人指導沒有人用科學方法，沒有人可以做他們信仰的中堅，所以說出話來，做起事來，總不能得工人的同意和諒解。你如眞是眞摯，誠意，熱心，負責，去指導他們，一些沒有取巧，偷安，卸責，偏私的壞處，處處替工人設想，處處謀工人的安全與快樂，我敢斷說工人信仰你不遑，那怕難管，那怕沒有辦法呢？現在一般人，都在那裏說什麼訓練，其實訓練上最最切要的，是在訓練你自己。你自己訓練好了，一般人當然也跟着好了。人苦不自知，倘能知道你自己的難管，時時刻刻流意到信用，責任，態度，能力，以身作則，先之勞之，那麼工人難管一句話，當然不能成立了。</p>

<p>乙這都是你家裏的那條哈吧狗不好。</p>
<p>甲奇了奇了。你自己傷風。和我的哈吧狗有甚麼相干。</p>

<h3>栩園隨筆</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>六陽道人丁愚畫山水近石谷每寫蜀中景物細如牛毛籋絲曩以畫劵囑題嘗和老友潘蘭史韵爲寫七古一首因畫筆寫報並題詩云孤雲萬里未曾還秋氣蒸騰滿宇間自信性情宜草野。深慚魄力遜荆關。禿頭老樹枝猶健。削面危崖石轉斑。一片塵心消不盡聊將鼠髯寫巫山。予在前年。即擬與江君鳳格。同行入蜀。卒以牽絆尙多。以致不果。今得此圖。以作臥游。則巫山之雲。正不必惟夢中見之矣。此筆即爲鳳梧所贈。其一面爲李天楨君所寫庚子感事詩三首。書法隋唐遒媚如董美人碑。詩則逼近浣花草堂云。休將事業問千秋。棄甲殘槍滿戌樓。骂賊已無顏太守。平蠻誰繼武鄉侯。浮沉身世英雄淚。破碎乾朝上戰士憂。王會何年傳盛事天敎化外盡來游。江邊八陣幕盤鴉。流水滔滔感歲華。忽說妖氛揚粉黛。那堪戰骨暴黃沙。涼悽刁斗風聲慘。黯淡旌旗日影斜。縱有蒪鱸歸不得。淵明今已負黃花。時局艱危喚奈何。哀哉海水又揚波。英雄自古書勛早。宰相從來誤國多。座有良平難决勝。軍非郭李况傷和。興衰氣運歸天數。回首秦中淚似沱。李君亦蜀中人。來滬有年。鬻書不求重價。有以市招巨額乞書者。恐其不肯署名。因挽鳳梧詢之。李君謂以國人所設之國貨商店爲限。且免潤筆之資。良以懸之國門。固自有其聲價。正與六陽道人畫　。輒窮數日之工。而寫千山萬壑。僅取十金。聊供一醉。以視狂徒潑墨。動自標價千金者。貪廉相去之遠。又豈可以道里計耶。</p>
<h3>精武會海上旅行記</h3>
<p>— 李慶多</p>
<p>際此盛夏。浱溽暑薰蒸。困居市廛。殊爲鬱悶。本埠精武體育會旅行組。爲謀會員暑天如樂起見。特於上星期日（十日）舉行海上旅行。租定賚豐輪船。駛往吳淞口外兜風納凉。參加者原以五百人爲額。皆屬該會會員。曁其家屬。每人收費五角。會員家屬减半。十歲以下孩童免費。予本非會員。因爲新聞界份子。故亦蒙歡迎加入。</p>
<p>參加之踴躍　是日下午二時後。旅行者陸續登船。船泊金利源碼頭。予至時。已三時餘。到者益踴躍。未及先期報名參加而臨時買票加入者頗夥。故已溢出定額。共到六百餘人。各人登船後。分至樓上下覓座。不須臾。座爲之滿。竚立船上者不在少數。足見炎夏多欲避暑也。</p>
<p>船上之佈置　寶豐船中均先事佈置。頗有條理。計分辦事室。中樂部。西樂部。點心部。冷飲部等。客欲進西點。冰淇淋。飲汽水等。無不立致。不啻一臨時小西餐館。遊得不飢渴。是亦該會職員辦事之妥善也。船中並調到中國童子軍十餘名。擔任指導及維持秩序。</p>
<p>舟行之從容　時甫三時有半。一聲汽笛。船即啓椗。童子軍同時奏樂。船遂離岸。緩緩而行。衆賓精神煥發。同行者女賓幾佔半數。孩童亦有二三十名。女賓類皆靑春少艾。服裝艷麗。一時衣香鬢影。滿船芬芳。衆皆憑欄凝眺。船旁擠無隙地。循岸而行。巍樓巨厦。鱗次櫛比。外灘爲滬上精華之區。一覽無遺。殊覺壯觀。沿途中樂與西樂同時大作。音韻悠揚。至足怡情。尤以某女士高歌一曲。爲最娛耳。斯時烈日當空。而江風習習。拂人衣袂。熱勢爲之稍殺。</p>
<p>吳淞口風景　瀏覽有頃。不覺已達吳淞口。取視時計。剛爲五時。舟再前行。直出口外。乘風破浪。速度驟增。一片汪洋。浩瀚無際。而夕陽西下。彩霞突佈。遠帆點點。依稀在目。天然佳景。眞如一幅絕美錦繡也。無何。烟波蒼茫。天色已瞑。船乃轉舵回駛。衆仍遠眺不已。</p>
<p>海上看明月　嫦娥若隱若現。漸漸東升。而成一大玉盤。朗照大海。浮光耀於水面。作黃金色。微波盪漾。無限美感。忽而浮雲頓蔽蟾光。舉首一望。已過楊樹浦。繁華海上萬燈齊明。壯麗奪目。乘凉旣久。塵襟盡滌。歸舟旋亦傍岸。衆遂興盡而返。時正十時半。適屆預定鐘點。此行曁歷七小時之久。浦江風景。領略不少。有此勝遊。不可不記余乃即夕記之如此</p>
<h3>球賽之精神與興趣</h3>
<p>— 沈鎭潮</p>
<p>邇來滬上人士。對於各種球賽。興趣殊濃。每屆强隊賽期。無不爭先恐後。人海人山。證之樂華足球隊與臘克斯威脫夏隊諸役。天津南開五虎籃球隊之戰。網球名將林寳菙邱飛海之賽。觀者恒逾萬或逾千。轟動遐邇。各種球賽。精神不同。興趣亦異。爰就管見所及。縷述之。</p>
<p>威武雄壯之足球　球類之中。足球最合軍隊戰鬥形式。有前鋒。有後衛。中則中堅筆立。接濟四方。輔以左右前衛。陣式結構。幾與軍中無異。每當五前鋒一線進攻。左右兩翼齊進。衝鋒陷陣。勢如破竹之時。其威武雄壯。有不可一世之槪。球賽之中。滬人最感興趣者。當推足球。西人足球會中樂華之賽。無一次非六七千觀衆。球迷之中。因此而寢食俱忘者有之焉。</p>
<p>陣法無窮之籃球　籃球似足球而塲地小。一則以足。一則以手。亦有前鋒。亦備後衛。籃球塲地小而抵禦易故必出之以迅速而其無窮陣法亦最足引人興趣。五人連防有如銅綱之陣。他若各個防禦。倫理襲退守。遠擲近投。變幻莫測。球賽中之具濃郁興味者也。</p>
<p>分工合作之排球　有謂華北之人愛籃球。則排球當屬之華南。其排球隊陣年執遠東運動會錦標。排球組織。以每排三人合三排成之。前排司防禦。曰擋手。中排職攻擊。曰殺手。後排則專在救急。曰救手。各司各職。井然不紊。曰此分工合作之原理也。</p>
<p>貴族色彩之網球　網球爲個人競技。非可數人而混賽者。球拍及球均須個人置備。而一拍之值。昂者須四五十金。劣者不可用。賽綱球者。服裝尤須整齊講究美觀者。恒取料白嗶嘰等物。故曰貴族色彩。</p>
<p>準確敏㨗之棒球　棒球須出之以準確敏㨗。持棒擊球。非準確則不得。棄棒佔壘。非敏㨗則被殺。即守衛之投手接手游擊司壘。亦準確敏㨗爲其要技。否則錯誤百出。美人知此技最深。倍倍羅斯有棒球大王之準。日人亦愛之若狂。惜國人猶少注意者。</p>
<p>其他球類如哥爾夫曲棍抱令（Ｂowling）橄欖球等則國人知之者少。習之者亦鮮也。</p>
<h3>家庭新識</h3>

<h3>法國近事</h3>
<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>歐洲聯盟一事現在各國答復法政府之覺書已大致到齊。如波蘭羅馬尼亞等國。其外交方針本惟法政府之馬首是瞻。當然無大異議。且聯盟之實制行。此等弱小國家不惟經濟方而大蒙其利。其國家獨立之安全上亦可更加一層保障。故此等國家之覆文。除表示充分贊成法國提案外。均再三聲明聯盟之制應以保障各國安全及絕對尊重其領土之完整與獨立爲基礎云。</p>
<p>其較有研究價值者。爲意德兩國覆文。意國覆文從全體看來。語調和婉。殊出吾人意料之外。該覆文首先聲明意政府準備參與聯盟制之討論。其次。意政府對於法國覆文加以若干批註。並表示種種意見。如對於小弱國主權之尊重。對於戰敗國之平等待遇等。意國主張歐洲聯盟應以不侵犯國際聯盟之存在爲限。凡未加入國際聯盟之國如蘇俄。如土耳其。均應使之加入歐洲聯盟。最後意國表示如歐洲聯盟之主要目的在使各國成立一種緊密之協作時。則應先將軍縮問題解决云。吾人如將意國覆文細讀一過。可知意政府固時時妨備法國有執歐洲大陸覇權之野心。故努力於擴大及變更法國原案。並特爲各小弱國及戰敗國說話。其所舉張之軍縮問題殆亦全爲法國而變也。</p>
<p>德國覆文大致與意大利覆文相近。如對於國際聯盟主權之尊重。及希望蘇俄與土耳其之加入等。均與意政府之意見同。惟德國覆文有一重要特性。即暗暗主張修改條約是也。此覆文態度謙遜。措辭謹愼。關於修改條約一事。雖再三提及。但語多諷示。並未顯言。不過明眼人一見自知耳。覆文之第一節即言聯盟之目的在於和解的精神中。從事於一種大膽的改造。並使歐洲獲得一種惟以正義與平等爲基礎始能成立之眞正和平。其次又云改良歐洲政局之一切企畫全視能否運用下述種種綱領爲轉移。此等綱領即權和之整個的平等。各國安全相等。民族間之和平的諧調等是也。現在生存條件旣與此等綱領衝突。應求有效之方法以資改正云云。</p>
<p>總之。歐洲聯盟一事。各國財政方面雖均有此需要。但彼此又各有其不同之利害。因而所見未能一致。如德國所暗示之改約運動。法國即萬難承認。至蘇俄與土耳其之加入。亦有問題。聞各有關係國家將於今秋在日內瓦國際聯盟繼續討論此事。前途困難正多。實現之期當甚遠也。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（六十七）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>游梵爾賽宮Versailles(二)</p>
<p>好一個宏崇壯麗的宮殿。地板是用無數的不同顏色的小木塊所砌成。結構起種種圖案。顯出光明的色澤。長二十餘丈。藻井都是壁畫。盤飾着的是燦耀輝皇的彫金。門窗都是厚玻璃。左右列白石彫像無數。這是從前路易十四的舞殿。那路易全盛時代。聚着諸候貴族曳着綺羅的美女和名優。踏了這光耀的地板歌舞着的光景。還可以使人推想的。我們已經上樓了罷。儘走進去又是宴殿寢殿。哦。好龐大的三幅畫。畫的是拿破崙的授鷹式。是拿破崙的馬上的雄姿。前一幅是達維Jacques　Louis　David的手筆。後一幅是他的得意門生格羅士Gros的手筆。還有一幅可不知名了。達維是拿破崙的首座宮廷畫師。這便是受了拿破崙的命令而成就了的巨作。是極意寫實的畫像。現在放在梵爾賽的大殿中。以供給世人瞻仰那大英雄的威儀的。同時也是美術史家們可貴的資料。畫幅是龐大得可觀。極複雜的構圖是可以使人看得暈眩。拿破崙站在左面。身上被着紅絨的外衣。舉起雙手。正在那裏訓話似的。環繞着的有幾十個的人物。手裏執着鷹頭旗幟都顯示十分虔誠的樣子。又一間大廳。四面刻金。設寳座。上有華蓋。外面有銅闌。這大約是當皇帝召見之處吧。燦然的金的色調。也還足以使我們想像當時的嚴肅和榮華。後方那邊是寢殿。有十幾處。皆有臥床。坐處倚處。陳設精美絕倫。幾榻地毯都是路易十四原物。在別國博物院得其一幾一榻。已爲壞寳。在這裏視之。眞不足爲奇了。穿過十餘以殿。都是密密層層地排列着的壁畫。眞是洋洋大觀了。因爲太多了。那些作者的大名。我也不能一一記出。好才這裏决不足以畫的本身爲重的。原意所着重的是在顯示着畫中所畫的事蹟。所有法國以前。王后妃的大禮大事圖。與各國戰爭圖都是聚集在這裏。我只好將全部說個大槪。你看這一張是大革命那時迫路易十六簽字退位之圖。哦。那張不是革命後兩黨相殺之圖嗎。其中有羅蘭夫人的像。羅蘭夫人。秀美如蘭。令人傾倒。而焚香碎玉。芝艾同焚。無賢愚才士。皆投一燼。我們俯仰其下。還覺得不勝慘痛哩。其他有路易十四即位圖臨議院儀式圖會西班牙王非臘第四渡來因河圖。拿破侖會俄主亞力山大圖。又一殿懸路易十六閱兵圖。一千八百五十六年各國使臣大集圖。拿破侖第三登位圖。我們仰觀於其間。有難於言表的一種莊嚴之感。他不論是生寃家死對頭。英帝霸王。賢主暴君只要在歷史上闖過大禍的。他們就一一將他表現出來。這實在是一部嚴正的歷史啊。</p>

<h3>時代靑年第二期</h3>
<p>— 光美</p>
<p>目前中國整個的靑年界似乎只有這兩條出路惡化和腐化惡化的挺而走險不惜自己的性命不知寳貴靑年時代黃金般的光陰不尋找正當的出路不圖謀積極的向上的相當發展終日所想象的所希望的所接觸的所榮繞於腦際的所充塞於整個心靈的無非是饑餓窮愁燒殺破壞打倒反對等等腐的呢可以分爲好幾派別頹廢的墮落的悲觀的消極的厭世的浪漫的還有一種是徬徨的這兩種事實的現象幾已成爲中國靑年的世紀病了眞正能夠超脫出這兩種偌大的病症向走在人生正意義的旅路上的却是鳳毛麟角</p>
<p>靑年之所以形成這種病態簡括地說內面不滿於現實外面受種種五花八門的思想所影響久而久之以致走入歧途而不自覺靑年旣爲民族的元氣同時又是民族生命的寄托一個民族的興盛或衰頹當全視整個靑年界的情况以爲是斷如靑年所負之使命是何等重大今以中國而論靑年界的現象是不外上述那兩種情形試問以這兩種畸形的靑年來負肩起中興國家的責任國家如何會興盛民族如何會繁榮若再照這樣演進下去中華民族只有坐以待斃</p>
<p>若欲突破這個絕大的危機便非趕來積極地圖謀救濟不可這救濟的方法第一當要從糾正已往的一切錯誤的思想和觀念着手竭力指出已往的一切錯誤象眞毫不客氣地掀開一切錯誤的內幕最好要指摘得體無完膚使那些爲鬼爲蜮的害人的思想無處匿藏同時更得指示出一條光明的大道人生正意義的旅途俾靑年有所適從換言之就是要確定出一個中心思想這個中心思想不消說便是爲民族而奮鬬</p>
<p>時代靑年便是負起這使命的表現她的創刊號已於上星期三出版鄙人已曾有過介紹其第二期又於本星期三與我們相見了我爲愛讀該刊同時更得將我之愛公諸大衆實則是靑年不可不讀的刊物再則該刊發行伊始恐靑年未盡周知所以我很樂於有第二次的介紹</p>
<p>第二期的內容有湯增敭的現代中國靑年病態的解剖鐵僧的世界弱小民族反帝運動的鳥瞰及中國民族求自由平等之出路徐則驤的爲民族而爭光前兩文是續上期的都是洋洋大文現代中國靑年病態的解剖湯君分剖得眞是詳盡無餘他是遠大的目光深刻的探討他從世界的潮流中國的環境找出中國靑年病態的根源他把整個的靑年界分析爲四大派一頹廢的二浪漫的三徬徨的四激進的更就這四派再詳加解剖確是淋漓盡致中國靑年所有之病態大都不出這四種範圍一如果讓它單純的度下去對於靑年本身的危險當然不必說即在社會與國家方面也有莫大關碍所以我們要設法醫治這幾種不良的病症是急遽不可容緩的事了本文尙未刊完我們且拭目以待下一期吧</p>
<p>世界弱小民族的鳥瞰及中國民族求自由平等之出路鐵僧君誠不愧爲是隻鳥兒鳥兒目光　洞察周詳當能勝人一籌現在僅就該文的兩段結論作相當介紹</p>
<p>中國民族求解放之途徑千萬不可再走從前向帝國主義者溫和求解放的錯路我們民族如果要求生路惟有奮起與帝國主義者相肉搏勵行革命外交廢除一切不平等條約以土耳其爲中國國民革命的良好榜樣其次當前的急務就是對於國際間弱小民族需有相當組織又次我們必得打倒他們經濟侵略的基礎</p>
<p>很草率的寫了幾句其餘請讀者自己去探討罷</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一九○）</h3>
<p>— 美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第四十章　亞美利加的詩</p>
<p>岡布里治康科特及波士頓的那些紳士的友人是有較之在他們的的胸中可眼見或耳聞似地燃着者還多的火藏在胸中的温雅的桂格敎徒那詩人就是喜替厄恐怕英吉利詩人克刺布以後從來沒有那麼非詩底的詩人着手於那困難的藝術罷同克刺布一樣喜替厄對於生命對於他所住的場景有着鮮活的感覺他的宗敎詩正如宗敎詩這東西常有的樣子是平板的他的民謠往是惡劣的文學有些時候如在船長埃來生的騎行似的也有着民謠音調他的近於傑作的作品是具的古昔紐英格蘭的冬天的淸冷與幽寂的雪中塲景眞實且粗疏而佳妙地表現出來喜替厄想做詩人之念很熱切有着表現的衝動然而正如在他的一篇眞實的詩中說着自己的事一般他是爲了未經訓練的耳的粗硬而受苦的</p>
<p>當年長的人們年老而成名之際（而坡在比較底年靑時死了）一個和被公認的老手年齡不相上下的大詩人也逐漸地被發見被賞識了窩爾忒惠特曼被稱爲優美的灰色詩人這是因爲他在那生涯的後半確是灰色的緣故然而他的草葉却是在亞美利加發表的最年靑最大膽最挑戰底的詩的書這是未熟與美之奇妙的混合在壯大的句子在句子的連續關係彌漫着力最劣的句子是拙劣得不亞於詩人曾經寫過的什麼句子的然而便是那些句子也由對於全卷的一致和結合而得補救了爲什麼呢因爲草葉是一本完全的書一個人多年間的詩底生活惠特曼頌揚着民主主義他將自己作爲有趣的人頌揚着實在他是有趣的人他在那中間的時代以高貴的詩頌揚着亞伯拉罕林肯在林肯和惠特曼之間有一種豫定了的關係存在羅厄爾稱馬可脫温爲亞美利加文學的林肯他是作了適當的聯想的爲什麼呢因爲林肯不會理解作爲詩人的惠特曼林肯的詩的意識是遠在他自身的本能底的或被開發的散文詩的意識之下的然而時描靈光（Halo）於林肯的頭的周圍也就顯出惠特曼給戴於那苦惱的額上的花環的圓光美來惠特曼是憑了因此而日益被感知了似的方法成了林肯的桂冠詩人的在門庭開花的紫丁香凋萎時無疑地是亞美利加詩的高的標識而且在惠特曼的一切心氣中都有非常的瞬間毫無價值的東西他寫了不少威至威士和別的詩人們也如此在那最高點惠特曼是海和太陽的踐踏地球的數百萬人們的純眞的詩人惠特曼在想像中以爲自己創製了新的詩形而抖棄了因襲的律呂和句格的桎梏了然而使他成爲偉大者並非他的形式的獨創性或怪僻性他的美在於和英吉利詩一樣古老的本質底律呂而他的獨創性不過在他是偉大的詩人是新而獨創底的詩人在他的最優處這一端而已留於後者總是詩人的最優的處所哩</p>
<p>惠特曼以後亞美利加詩大都逐漸退化了然而雖是優美的什麼詩選也要揭載一些下面那樣的詩的罷就是厄密力笛肯生的雖簡潔到奇妙而表現了一半似時但在那樣式表現了十分的詩雖不中止爲亞美利加人却令人聯想到愛爾蘭人因而也是詩人的路伊司基內所作的細巧的妖鬼詩詹姆士W萊里的純樸的詩具有華奢的美的托馬斯貝力奧爾德立赤的詩還有具有偉大的指望遠過於不健康和無數的困難使繆斯的神得以給他實現者的詩人錫德尼拉尼爾的詩即在大詩人之中要找出較之拉尼爾的格林的沼及日出還耀眼模樣絢爛的什麼來也很困難的往往亞美利加詩人是荏弱缺乏表現力聲音不淸的然而厄斯刺飛爾的立琴却還沒有去絃而且倘說亞美利加不是歌之國那麼可以說在那裏是不時有純粹而美的調兒的（全書完）</p>

<h3>猶太人的戲劇</h3>
<p>— 楊昌溪</p>
<p>關於黑人在文學中所表現的民族底覺醒是簡略的論過了但是與尼格羅民族遭着同樣命運的還有猶太民族在呢他流落的時間比尼格羅民族悠長他們散佈的區域比黑人更遼闊而且在世界各國天才的發明家政治的先覺者有許多都是猶太人的血所培養成的異國人（最明顯的例可以在德俄兩國的科學界和政治方面尋出）所以在他們悠長的歷程中在文學上的地位尤其是在俄國和美國文學中的地位是佔着很重要的地位</p>
<p>在俄國文學中的猶太人非惟在過去佔着很重要的地位即是在現代的新俄也有他們獨特的地位而最能表現猶太民族底特性的却深刻的在戲劇上呈現着所以我們要檢討猶太民族在新俄戲劇中如何注入他們底血如何的把關於猶太人的材料滲透在戲劇的組織中又非在那新俄戲劇史上特別展開一頁的猶太人凱莫奈戲院（Jewish　Kamernyv　theatre）和海別馬戲班（Habama）上加以研究不可</p>
<p>猶太人凱莫奈戲劇院開始以一九一八年在列寗格勒成立因爲那時格洛夫斯基（a.　m.　Granoski）從西方轉來了他在德國同名導演家萊因哈特（Reinbardt）一道工作而且對於西歐的戲院成了熟手因此他開始創立猶太演劇技術室（Jeuish　theatrical　Studio)經過了他們六個整月苦心的訓練新猶太戲劇家阿胥（Sholom　Ash)和比利時梅特林克等的脚本都依着歐洲的訓練而上演了在一九二○年移到莫斯科因爲在那兒住着許多猶太人而且因爲他們的戲劇和戲院都因美妙因此這靑年的羣隊獲得了深䆳的同情而且更明確的轉向於以猶太人作材料的脚本以後因着經濟的增進和猶太人的演員對於藝術的磨練才移到了廣大的塲所在藝術上的訓練因爲猶太人有天生的對於藝術認爲是宗敎表現和景仰的一種特性所以一個演員未成爲一個駕馭他的心理和感情於各種人物的熟練的表達時必須經過長時間刻苦的訓練在格洛夫斯基的領導中除了上演些俄國和其他國家的戲劇外對於能表現猶太精神的戲劇特別的加以注意所以在全俄紛立的工農或藝術的戲院</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>中他們能爲猶太民族開放一種特異的花朶也是全俄聯邦民族中　有的碩果最近他們到德國柏林去作要期的游行表演除了從德國人接受熱烈的讚翊外特別是猶太人的觀衆對他們表示很親切的摯愛</p>
<p>與這戲院同爲弟兄的還有海別馬戲班這戲班在德國是被認爲最有藝術價值的貢獻者之一內部的演員都是從猶太巴勒士坦（Palestine）而來僑居的人民他們在自然主義導演家司塔司斯拉夫斯基（Stanislavski）底弟子阿但俄夫底訓練中把俄國舞台的規範與巴勒士坦猶太人的謹嚴相慘合這種由兩種古式的民族性滋長出來的十分奇特的藝術生活和深沉的嚴肅性連結便在俄國革命後而獨特的成爲一種藝術他們也與猶太人凱莫奈戲院一樣在訓練的時候只有奮起自己的精神用一種宗敎的聖潔的虔敬的完美的表演他們的方法是與歐洲戲院不同他們對於脚本的研討是細密的預習是謹嚴過眞的導演是刻苦的研究他的計劃畫家是細心的揮動他的畫筆服色與排場和動作音樂等都不曾苟且的疏漏並不因爲經濟困難而簡略排演的預習而他們是在經濟困難時努力在團體外找工作把這種團體維持下去所以他們伴着猶太人的嚴肅性在內部親密的團結來隔絕世界在他們的世界中獨力的生活</p>
<p>因爲這兩個猶太民族的戲劇團體自然而然的他們的力量達到了其他戲院的脚本的本身和藝術價值的估量所以俄國的民衆要求戲劇於宣傳之外要注重藝術都是感受了猶太民族給予他們的刺激</p>
<p>而同時在美國文學中猶太人也是值得注意的雖然他們是窮困而且大多住在紐約特別爲猶太人設置的東邊區（Dast　Side)作苦工和賣淫的生活但是在文學中也有如哥爾德（Micbe　Gold）那樣傑出的震動世界的工人文學家和劇戲家而最能表出猶太人在戲劇上的活力和他們的民族精神便要算由哥爾德指導的猶太工人劇場了雖然他們給予美國文學的賜予沒有黑人那樣的顯明但是他們的地位却也不下於黑人只是他們沒有民族的自覺性在希伯來人宗敎的陶冶中永遠的成爲落伍的民族</p>
<h3>紐約百層巨厦之計劃</h3>
<p>美國紐約的最高度建築物烏耳華斯樓（Woolworlh　Jower）頂早已打破了世界的新紀錄即是到現在其他各國也還沒有得及得上它底高度的建築物但是它的離地七百九十二尺的五十餘層高樓的地位快要爲紐約城中央的切雷士倫大厦（Charyslei　Building）的離地八百零八尺的六十七層的建築物所奪了與這六十七層同樣預擬中的還有離地一千零六十二尺的八十七層的帝國大厦（Empire　State　Bulding)和紐約市民生命保險公司（Metiopoliton　life　Insurance　Company）百層樓的計劃市民保險公司較之八十七層的建築物要高三十二層對於基礎也極力研究能勝任百層高變重量之基石而公司內部之裝置除礦物質與玻璃而外其他均不合於使用總計該公司將來之用人必由一萬二千而增至三萬其規模與經營之事業必爲世界之冠云（易康）</p>

<h3>Difficulty in Managing Workers (Wan Yang)</h3>
<p>Difficulty in managing workers, difficulty in managing workers. This catchphrase is popular among those who serve in factories, just like old women chanting Amitabha Buddha, so often that it's become familiar and tedious. If you approach managing workers with this mindset, then of course workers will be difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Generally, workers' work is by no means intentionally destructive. They suffer from a lack of leadership, guidance, scientific methods, and someone to be the mainstay of their faith. Therefore, what they say and do often fails to gain the agreement and understanding of the workers. If you are truly sincere, earnest, enthusiastic, and responsible in guiding them, without any trickery, complacency, shirking responsibility, or favoritism, and always think of the workers, seeking their safety and happiness, I dare say that workers will trust you completely. Why worry about difficulty in managing or lack of solutions? Nowadays, people are all talking about training, but the most crucial aspect of training is training yourself. If you train yourself well, others will naturally follow suit. People suffer from not knowing themselves. If you can recognize your own shortcomings in management and constantly pay attention to integrity, responsibility, attitude, and ability, leading by example and taking the lead in hard work, then the saying "difficulty in managing workers" will naturally become unfounded.</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Telegraphic Report of Victory</h3>
<p>Successful Operation Plan in Shandong Province</p>
<p>Main Force of Jin Army Completely Defeated</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Weapons, Ammunition, and Supplies Captured</p>
<p>Feng Army's Front Line Completely Silent</p>
<p>Liuhe, Generalissimo Chiang's telegraph to various newspapers on the 16th, for your information: Last month, when the military campaign against the rebels on the Longhai Railway was in full swing, and the armies of Hunan and Guangdong were encircling and suppressing the remnants of Zhang Fakui and Li Jishen, the rebel Yan Xishan took the opportunity to invade Shandong. Our army changed its strategy, temporarily abandoning Jinan, defending the north of Yanzhou, and securing Qingdao in the east. After Zhang Fakui and Li Jishen's armies were defeated, I mobilized the victorious divisions from central Hunan to assist in the counteroffensive in Shandong. At the same time, the Longhai Railway also repeatedly defeated enemy forces, allowing us to withdraw troops. Therefore, a plan was decided: on the Jinpu Railway front, Liu Zhi would be the commander-in-chief, with the divisions of Chen Cheng, Xia Douyin, Ma Hongkui, and Hu Zongnan as the central army, advancing from the front of Yanzhou along the railway; the divisions of Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, attached with Zhang Qiaoling's cavalry, would serve as the right-wing army, bypassing the west end of Xintai to attack; the divisions of Feng Yuxiang, Pei Hubei, Hu Bohan, and Yang Shengzhi, as well as the Shandong Security Brigade, and the brigades of Cheng Zhongcheng, Chen Xiaosi, and Liang Hongen, would serve as the left-wing army, advancing along the WenShang Ningyang line on the west side of the railway. All forces launched their attack on the 1st of this month. Additionally, Xu Kexiang's division, attached with the 64th Cavalry Regiment, would serve as the left flank column, advancing towards the enemy's rear in Jinan via Yuncheng, Dong'e, Pingyin, and Changqing. The Jiaoji Railway army, under the command of Han Fuqu and with Li Yunheng as the left-wing army, would serve as the central army's Third Route Army, attacking along the railway from the area west of Changle. Furthermore, Liu Zhennian's army would serve as the right-wing army, blocking the rebel enemy's return route. Our Jinpu Railway's right-wing army first defeated the rebel enemy Qin Shaoguan's force near Tai'an on the 6th, occupying the Tai'an Railway Station. Cai's division surrounded a portion of the enemy within Tai'an City, and the majority of the enemy fled north. Our left-wing army and Xu Kexiang's division successively occupied Dong'e, Pingyin, Feicheng, and other areas. Our central army successively broke through enemy positions at Nanyi and Dawenkou, crossing the Wen River on the 7th. Ma's division was left to clear up the remaining enemy in Tai'an, while the rest cooperated with the various armies to continue pursuing and advancing. The rebel army fled in a panic, abandoning their heavy artillery, supplies, and horses south of the Wen River. It is estimated that over ten thousand rifles and over one hundred artillery pieces were captured. The rebels, including Chuan Zuoyi, Li Shengda, and Zhang Huizhao, barely escaped with their lives. Our army launched another general attack on the 11th from the line around Jieshou. The rebel enemy resisted at every turn and transferred their Jiaoji Railway forces, including Li Fuying and Feng Pengzhu, to reinforce the Jinpu Railway in an attempt to make a final stand. After five days and nights of fierce hand-to-hand combat and bloody battles, our army finally pushed the rebel enemy near Jinan and completely defeated them. Jiang's division of the right-wing army definitively occupied Jinan at 2:00 PM on the 15th. Due to our army's prior detour to occupy Zhangjiazhuang and other places, only a small portion of the rebel enemy fled to the north of the Yellow River, while the rest were captured. In this battle, countless officers and soldiers were captured, over thirty thousand rifles and two hundred and thirty artillery pieces were seized, and a large number of other supplies and ammunition were captured. The rebel enemy's only three aircraft were unable to be transported back. The circumstances of their panicked escape can be imagined. Since Yan Xishan occupied Jinan, he has touted his victory, called on various reactionary elements, and妄思 to organize a government. He instigated the rebel Feng Yuxiang to actively harass the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. Fortunately, all the officers and soldiers were loyal, brave, and united in their efforts, which allowed them to recapture Jinan and defeat the main force of the Jin rebels. Currently, our army on the Jinpu Railway is dividing into multiple routes to cross the river and pursue, and the various armies on the Jiaoji Railway are also cooperating and advancing. The Jin rebels will surely be completely annihilated. The remnants of Feng Yuxiang's rebel army have lost their courage upon hearing the news. Over the past ten days, they have launched their final fierce attacks on our various units, but they were completely silent last night. According to reports, they are already collapsing. Our army is deploying for pursuit, and it should not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. All this is thanks to the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the authority of the Central Government. I, Chiang Kai-shek, and all the officers and soldiers will redouble our efforts to eliminate the rebel atmosphere and remove obstacles to political tutelage in the shortest possible time, in order to live up to the Central Government's high expectations. I respectfully send this telegram for your attention. Chiang Kai-shek, 16th (public telegram).</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Safe and Sound in Beidaihe</h3>
<p>Remarks by Northeast Representative Qin Hua</p>
<p>Nanjing, our newspaper reporter recently met with Northeast representative Qin Hua and inquired about the whereabouts of Commander Zhang Xueliang and whether there had been any special news from the Northeast. Qin said that Commander Zhang is still in Beidaihe. Recent reports that he has decided on a date to return to Shenyang and to take up the post of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force are difficult to predict. As far as I know, Commander Zhang's support for the central government has been consistent and will not change with the times. The timing of taking office is also not an issue. However, his whereabouts and future expressions cannot be disclosed several days in advance. Various rumors from the outside are merely speculations. Foreign newspapers often fabricate unfounded claims about the Northeast, which are not worth refuting. The Northeast Beijing Office has wireless communication equipment that can communicate directly with Shenyang. If there were any special news, it would be kept secret from the outside world, but it would certainly be known to me. There are also important central figures stationed in the Northeast. If any incident were to occur, it would undoubtedly be reported to the central government. The spread of rumors may have other purposes, but the facts will prove them baseless and not worth debating (17th, special telegram).</p>
<p>Beijing, Wang Shuhan telegraphed Wei Daofeng from Beidaihe on the 16th, stating that Commander Zhang is now at the seaside and is in good health and spirits. Recently, the commander of Yu Xuezhong's department, Brigade Commander Ma Tingfu, and the two regimental commanders, An Meng, have been dismissed from their positions due to unclear salary matters. Replacements have been sent and the matter has been properly handled. Rumors are not to be trusted. Special reply (17th, special telegram).</p>
<p>Beijing, yesterday Guo Taiqi spoke with Gu Weijun in Beidaihe by telephone. Gu said that Zhang Xueliang is in good health and the Northeast army has absolutely no other movements. The rumors in Beijing have no impact. English source: Zhang Xueliang is in better health than before and exercises daily. He will return to Huludao by ship in the coming days. As soon as the train line is clear, he will return to Shenyang immediately. The rumors in Beijing obviously have a considerable effect. On the same day, the English side verified it was incorrect within 20 minutes that Shanhaiguan has not been under martial law (17th, special telegram).</p>
<p>Tokyo, reports received here from Shenyang and Beijing state that the rumors of Zhang Xueliang's assassination are baseless. Zhang is still residing in Beidaihe (17th, Reuters telegram).</p>
<p>Beijing, according to confirmed reports from Beidaihe today, Zhang Xueliang's health is improving daily. He plays tennis for recreation (17th, Reuters telegram).</p>

<h3>British Fleet's Visit to Constanta Harbor</h3>
<p>The Balkans have become a dangerous region in the world for three reasons: First, the Balkans are a crucial thoroughfare for east-west transportation in Europe, making it a region contested by various countries. Second, the Balkans are a melting pot of various races from east and west, leading to misunderstandings due to differences in language, religion, culture, and customs. Third, after the liberation of Turkey, various ethnic groups have competed for independence and autonomy, making the Balkan problem complex and unsolvable, leading to frequent wars. After the Great War, it seemed that the problem could be thoroughly resolved, but due to border disputes, conflicts of interest, and different views on welcoming or rejecting major powers, disputes still arise from time to time. Although there is the so-called Little Entente organization, the barriers have not been consolidated, and the major powers still have the intention to interfere from time to time. This is why the Balkan problem is still attracting the world's attention. Among the Balkan countries, Romania is of key importance. Since obtaining the northern Dobruja region and a Black Sea outlet, its national power has increased rapidly. Today, a dispatch from Bucharest states that newspapers frequently express the view that the British fleet's visit to Constanta Harbor indicates that a British naval base may be established in the Black Sea. It also states that the Romanian government previously established a committee to study the coastal defense of Constanta Harbor because the Soviet Russian Black Sea Fleet had increased its number of cruisers, which had passed through the Tartar Strait from the Baltic Sea, causing surprise in various countries. A British admiral also attended the meeting and put forward plans to build a fortress. Today's visit is not unrelated to this matter, which is to say, it is not unrelated to the Balkan problem. One theory is that the British military's visit is related to the Turkish-Greek dispute, but we dare not believe it deeply and will await further information.</p>

<p>Possibly Related to Plans to Build Forts, Romanian Newspapers Express Surprise</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 16th (National News Agency) Local newspapers, when discussing the visit of the British fleet to Constanta, Romania, express the possibility that there may be a British naval base established in the Black Sea. Earlier this year, the Soviet Russian Black Sea Fleet increased its number of cruisers by two. At the time, the two ships passed through the Tartar Strait from the Baltic Sea, causing surprise in various countries. As a result, the Romanian government sent a committee to study the naval defense of Constanta. British Admiral Henderson was also included in the committee. Later, a plan to build forts was proposed. The current visit of the British fleet to Constanta, although initiated by the British Navy, is thought to be not entirely unrelated to this plan, or it is said that this trip is related to the dispute with Spain.</p>
<h3>Turkish Government Recalls Ambassador to Poland</h3>
<p>Seemingly Not to be Regarded as a Severance of Turkish-Polish Relations, the Negotiations for the Joint Suppression of the Kurds are Underway</p>
<p>Delhi, 16th (National News Agency) A telegram reports that the Turkish government has recalled its ambassador to Poland, indicating that Turkey is still dissatisfied with the Polish government's recent attitude towards the joint suppression of the Kurdish rebels. However, this statement has not been verified by officials.</p>
<p>Ankara, 16th (National News Agency) An official statement stated that the recall of the Turkish ambassador to Persia is only a change of Turkish diplomatic personnel and should not be regarded as a severance of Turkish-Polish diplomatic relations. The successor has already been appointed and will depart for Tehran next week to take office. Negotiations between Turkey and Poland for the joint suppression of the Kurdish rebels are temporarily being handled by the chargé d'affaires. These negotiations are currently underway in Tehran, and the Soviet Russian ambassador is also making every effort to mediate the dispute between Turkey and Poland.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Personnel Severely Criticize the Pan-European Plan</h3>
<p>Copies of the Memorandum Secretly Leaked, Replies from Various Countries Influenced by It</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (National News Agency) Sir Arthur Salter, Director of the Economic Section of the League of Nations Secretariat, has written a memorandum detailing the analysis of Briand's Pan-European Plan and severely criticized it, saying that it is greatly harmful to the League of Nations. This memorandum was submitted on May 20th, but has not been published to date, because its contents, according to those leaked by people in the League, certainly have secret reasons. It is said that the full text is quite long, with ten pages devoted to discussing the economic difficulties of Briand's plan, and demanding that this plan must be hosted by the League of Nations, otherwise the League of Nations will only be left with an empty name. Since this news came out, local French people have been greatly angered, pointing out that the criticisms of Briand's plan in the replies from various governments are mostly due to the power of this memorandum, because the governments of various countries have secretly received copies of it, so this memorandum is indeed a major obstacle to Briand's plan.</p>
<h3>Mexican Government Approves Debt Agreement with the United States</h3>
<p>Mexico City, 16th (Reuters) The Mexican government has approved the US-Mexico debt agreement. The agreement will only be effective after approval by the US Congress. The total amount of the debt is 51.5 million US dollars, which will be repaid with 49.2 million US dollars of 5% bonds, and the accumulated debt interest of approximately 20 million US dollars will also be greatly reduced. The Mexican railways are currently in a position of not being able to repay their debts and will be reorganized. The Mexican government's direct debt will be reduced to 26.7 million US dollars, secured by customs duties, and the railway debt will be reduced to 22.5 million US dollars, secured by railway assets. The new bonds will have a term of 45 years.</p>
<h3>Weihaiwei Handover Issue</h3>
<p>In View of the Unstable Situation in China, the British Government Will Reconsider</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) The Sunday Times has learned that the British government is now reconsidering the issue of handing over Weihaiwei, in view of the instability of the current situation in China. The original agreement was to hand it over in October of this year, but the handover date will likely be postponed.</p>
<h3>French Minister of War Emphasizes National Defense</h3>
<p>New Budget Difficult to Cut</p>
<p>Paris, 16th (National News Agency) French Minister of War Maginot, who is on leave outside the capital, spoke to a reporter from a certain newspaper today, emphasizing the importance of national defense. The increased budget for the Ministry of War for next year cannot be reduced. The reporter asked whether the cabinet agreed. Maginot did not answer, but said that the Ministry of War's budget had been reduced to the point where it could not be reduced any further in terms of national defense. With this budget, if an enemy suddenly invaded, it would be difficult to make appropriate defenses until the reserves were called up, and mobilization and assembly would take time and be difficult. Furthermore, since the National Assembly decided to reduce the term of military service from one and a half years to one year, the army is currently being reorganized, which inevitably increases expenses. Finally, he added that the French army is different from other countries and plays an important role in national defense. Its effectiveness cannot be reduced due to saving national funds, causing it to gradually weaken. Judging from the Minister of War's words, it seems that the French cabinet's desire to reduce the budget to make it equal to this year's will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>Spanish General Election</h3>

<h3>New Projects of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</h3>
<p>Handling Negotiations on Fishing Rights with Russia, Encouraging Distant-Water Whaling</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Den-tsu News Agency) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry held a budget provincial meeting yesterday and decided to submit the following new requests: [1] Spending 80,000 yen to set up resident officials in Moscow and Khabarovsk to handle fishing industry negotiations. Negotiations with Russia, which have always been handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will be handled by the Ministry of Agriculture itself in order to seek a quick solution.

<h3>Report on the First Half of the Year by the Bank of Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Den-tsu News Agency) According to the Bank of Japan's report on the first half of the year, (1) the amount of special loans recovered in the first half of the year was 5 million yen, only one-third of the amount recovered last year; (2) gold bullion, etc., were mostly used for minting gold coins, so it decreased by 118 million yen, becoming 707.7 million yen; (3) foreign currency decreased by 25 million yen, becoming 216 million yen, of which approximately 100 million yen was issued to the Yokohama Specie Bank before the lifting of the gold embargo for maintaining exchange rates, so it was only nominally designated savings; (4) cash reserves decreased by 25 million yen, becoming 216 million yen. Because so many gold coins were minted, although the amount of withdrawals was huge, the total amount did not decrease drastically.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Military News of the Central Army Capturing Jinan</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence The central army on the Tianjin-Pukou Line has advanced to Jieshou, and its flanks have also crossed Tai'an and Feicheng. The Shanxi army units are unable to withstand the pressure, so Yan has increased the transfer of Li Fuying's unit from the Jiaoji Line to the Tianjin-Pukou Line. Defense is deployed in the area north of Jieshou, Wand, and Zhangxia. However, the central army is still advancing rapidly on the side, and the left wing advancing team and Yang Shengzhi's unit are advancing along the west side of the railway towards Jinan. According to the front line telegram yesterday, the advancing team arrived only 30 li from Jinan, and Yang's unit arrived only 40 li from Jinan. The right wing Jiang and Cai's divisions surrounded Tai'an with a part of their forces, and a part of their forces attacked the Jinan and Tai'an city Shanxi troops from the east side of the railway. Two regiments were completely resolved, and Liu Zhi then stationed troops at Tai'an Railway Station on the 13th to supervise the battle. The Shanxi army felt increasingly unable to support it and prepared to retreat north. Han Fuju, Li Yunheng, Liu Zhennian, and other units on the Jiaoji Line launched a counterattack against the enemy on the east bank of the Weifang River from the 5th during heavy rain, and then progressed step by step. Yesterday, Han telegraphed Xu claiming that most of the troops had advanced westward from Zhangdian. This morning (15th), the Xuzhou Provisional Headquarters continued to receive reports from the front that the central army in the middle of the Tianjin-Pukou Line had advanced to Dangjiazhuang, the left wing had crossed the Donghe River and arrived at Changqing, and the right wing had advanced from Laiwu to Boshan. The Jiaoji Line army also came west to join forces. Jinan is already under the control of the central army, so this afternoon He Yaozu received a wireless message from Cai Tingkai on the evening of the 14th, claiming that the Shanxi army had retreated one after another to the north bank of the Yellow River. According to Jiang Jianren's telegram from the front to Xuzhou on the evening of the 14th, according to an airplane report, Jiang Guangnai's division had defeated the enemy near Jinan and chased them to Dajiankou, 15 li from Jinan. The left wing had advanced to the northwest area of Jinan, and the middle route Chen Cheng, Xia Douyin, and other units had passed Zhangxia Town and directly attacked Jinan. According to traffic news, Yan, due to the loss of Tai'an and the inability to defend Jinan, and due to diplomatic relations, has ordered the entire Shanxi army to retreat north across the Yellow River. The vanguard of the central army can arrive outside Jinan on the morning of the 15th and wait for orders to enter the city. (15th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Party and Government Organs Return to Jinan from Qingdao</h3>
<p>First Send Personnel to Jinan to Take Over the Jiaoji Railway and Prepare for the Opening of the Entire Line</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence The Shandong Provincial Government Office in Qingdao received a military report from the front yesterday, stating that the Shanxi army had completely withdrawn from Jinan and that Jiang Guangnai's unit of the central army had entered Jinan City at noon yesterday (15th). All businesses raised flags and set off cannons to welcome them, and the city was peaceful. After hearing the news, the various agencies intend to send personnel to take over first. The provincial party headquarters appointed Zhang Weicun as a member of the Licheng County Party Department, Zhang Hongjian as a member, Hou Shenglin as a member, the Provincial Government Secretariat appointed Huang Fuyuan and Wang Jiaju, the Jinan Municipal Government appointed Cheng Qibao and Li Fanghua, the Civil Affairs Department appointed Zhu Tingju and Zhang Yuancai, the Finance Department appointed Zuo Zonglian and Liu Quan, the Education Department appointed Xu Zhongyu, the Agricultural and Mining Department appointed Xu Shaozi, the Construction Department appointed Gao Qi, and the Industry and Commerce Department appointed Li Juncheng and Yu Guancheng. The above-mentioned people have already been dispatched by the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to prepare a special train last night, but many bridges along the Jiaoji Railway have been destroyed and are still being actively repaired. Whether they can be repaired in the near future is also a question. Furthermore, the Jiaoji Railway has suffered damage to all lines of construction due to the impact of the war, with the most severe losses occurring at the Zhangwei County Station, and the two railway bridges over the Weifang River and the Zihe River have also been partially destroyed, and the repair will take a considerable amount of time. In order to facilitate traffic, the bureau is actively preparing for the opening of the entire line. The most urgent task is to use sleepers to support the bridges along the line. However, the road only has 10,000 sleepers left, and all of them have been transported four times, which is not enough. A large amount of timber is now being purchased from major lumber yards in the city to meet the urgent need. Furthermore, the railway's telephone and commercial Qing-Ji telephone have been completely destroyed and will be difficult to repair for a while. According to station news, the Shanxi army in the western section of the Jiaoji Railway has not yet been completely withdrawn, and the railway tracks and bridges along the line that need to be repaired are urgently needed. The opening of the entire line will not be possible for a while. (August 16)</p>
<h3>Rumors in Wuhan Have Subsided</h3>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Rewards Military and Police for Their Efforts</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence In recent days, rumors have been rife in Wuhan, with reports from detectives that the Communists will launch a riot on August 14th and 15th. Wealthy households and public offices have moved to Shanghai and other places or have taken refuge in remote areas as if a major chaos was about to occur. The Garrison Headquarters has ordered the various districts of the three towns of Wuhan to be under martial law. The commander pays special attention to the 13th, 14th, and 15th. At 9:00 pm every night, martial law will be enforced, and no pedestrians or vehicles will be allowed to pass without a password. As a result, there are often pedestrians who are unaware of the martial law and are prohibited from moving and waiting until dawn at street corners or intersections. Jianghan Customs, Yi Garden Station, and other important traffic locations sometimes cut off traffic during the day and temporarily inspect pedestrians. All precautions are extremely strict. The French and Japanese concessions also simultaneously and uniformly enforced martial law, so there was no action on the 13th, 14th, and 15th, and the panic of the residents was immediately calmed down. The garrison headquarters believes that the military and police in the three districts of Wuhan have been able to use their lives in the matter of martial law and have made great achievements. The fact that the Communist Party did not dare to cause trouble may be due to the preparedness of the martial law, which made it impossible to move, so it was decided to reward the military and police separately to encourage them. The rewards for the troops are: [1] Hankou District, 3rd Regiment of Central Gendarmerie, reward of 280 yuan, Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau, 20 yuan, Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau Security Corps, 290 yuan [2] Wuchang District, 6th Regiment of the 3rd Teacher Training Regiment headquarters and direct platoon, reward of 140 yuan, 1st Battalion of the 6th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Teacher Training Regiment, reward of 100 yuan, Wuchang Public Security Bureau, 20 yuan, 1st Brigade of Security, 130 yuan, 2nd Brigade of Security, 130 yuan [3] Hanyang District, 3rd Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Teacher Training Regiment, reward of 100 yuan [4] Other guerrilla brigades, reward of 100 yuan, Water Public Security Bureau, 20 yuan, Water Patrol, 40 yuan, Headquarters Guard Company, 30 yuan, Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department Detective Team, 30 yuan (August 16)</p>
<h3>Luo Lin's Division Recovers Pingjiang</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence After the Fourth Route Army recovered Changsha, it divided into two routes to pursue and suppress the Communists: [1] He Jian led his 19 regiments to pursue and suppress Peng and Huang in Liuyang [2] Luo Lin, commander of the newly formed 22nd Division, led his three brigades to advance on Pingjiang to suppress Kong Fei. Liuyang was recovered on the 11th, and He Jian stationed in Liucheng on the 12th. Peng Fei led his troops to flee to the border of Jiangxi. The Pingjiang area was also recovered by the newly formed 22nd Division as early as the 8th. The Communist bandit Kong Hechong led his troops to flee to Xiushui, Jiangxi. Because the telegraph and telephone lines had been destroyed by the bandits and traffic was blocked, news was delayed until yesterday when Luo Lin received a telegram from the Luotuo Railway Bureau. It was heard that Luo Lin himself had stationed in Pingjiang County on the 13th to clear the remaining bandits. The following is a recording of Luo Lin's quick telegram: According to reports from Brigade Commander Yi Bingqian and Brigade Commander Xi Bingjun on the geng day from Pingjiang, [1] Bingjun led his troops through Nanjiang Meixian, and Bingqian led his troops through Wukou City Sanjiaotang, both arriving near Pingjiang on the yushen day. The agricultural bandits were rampant along the way, and the entire area was red. The officers and others searched and defeated them section by section. [2] The red bandit independent division commander Kong Hechong had more than 1,000 rifles and more than 10,000 spears. He retreated to Pingjiang County. Yu Bingqian's troops surrounded it from the southwest, and Bingjun's troops surrounded it from the northeast. The bandits resisted stubbornly and fought fiercely until the evening. The bandit forces could not withstand the attack and broke out towards Changshou Street. The officers and others sent a team to intercept them at Sanyang City, killing countless bandits and seizing more than 300 rifles. Geng was completely restored to Pingjiang. [3] The officers and others are now leading a part of the troops to pursue towards Sanyanqiao and Xianzhong City, and sending a part of the troops to search and suppress the agricultural bandits near Pingjiang in order to pacify the local area. Please telegraph the Hunan Provincial Government to quickly appoint an able county magistrate to Pingjiang to handle the aftermath. [4] According to accurate reports, when Peng Fei's main force fled to Liuyang, they looted more than 2,000 dan of ammunition and supplies in Changsha. Please telegraph friendly forces to quickly pursue. If they slow down, the bandits will definitely flee into Xiushui or Longxiang's old nest, and the future troubles will be difficult to overcome. Furthermore, according to the report from Brigade Commander Hu Liangyu of the Luo Lin Division on the geng day, the female bandit Hu Yun led hundreds of spears to burn and kill along the way in Jinjing and Gaoqiao. A team was immediately dispatched to attack them. The bandits fled towards Liuyang after passing Shashi Street and are now being tracked and pursued. Except for ordering Yi Xi and Hu's brigades to continue their efforts to pursue and suppress them in order to completely pacify the bandits in Pingjiang County, this is reported.

<h3>Establishment Ceremony of the Hubei Branch of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Prison</h3>
<p>Hu Yimin Reports on the Preparations</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence Hu Yimin, who was sent by the Commander-in-Chief's Office to prepare the Hubei Branch of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Prison, has been preparing for eight months. A few days ago, Hu came to Hankou from Beijing. The old site of the correctional facility has been repaired and improved, so he repeatedly consulted with the local military authorities and decided to receive military prisoners from the 20th of this month and hold an establishment ceremony in the auditorium of the prison at 12:00 noon on the 16th. More than 100 people attended, including all staff members, wardens, soldiers, and guests from all walks of life. The ceremony was presided over by Prison Director Hu Yimin, who reported on the preparations. He briefly said that Wuhan is located in the center of the country and there is an urgent need for a military prison. In December of last year, Liu Zhi, the second route commander-in-chief, requested the central government to send personnel to prepare for the establishment. The central government sent my brother to Hankou to start preparations. After Commander-in-Chief Liu went to the east road to supervise the battle, my brother and Commander Xia Douyin jointly searched for a location. At that time, my brother thought that organizing a large-scale army branch prison was of the utmost importance. As a result, it was believed that the original site of the correctional facility was suitable for reconstruction and expansion. At that time, there were approximately 1,000 military prisoners detained in ordinary prisons in Wuchang, who urgently needed to be managed separately, so on the one hand, he discussed the relocation with the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Government, and on the other hand, he submitted a request to the Commander-in-Chief to telegraph the Municipal Government to allocate the correctional facility to the prison, which was fully realized this spring. However, the existing buildings are still insufficient and are planned to be expanded within the base. The Commander-in-Chief also ordered the provincial government to allocate 200,000 yuan nearby, and ordered the Military Administration Department and the Military Supplies Department to send personnel to Hankou to assist. Later, because the Hubei provincial government's treasury was insufficient and could not allocate funds, my brother went to Beijing to ask for instructions and was instructed to allocate a small amount of start-up funds first and temporarily reduce the scope of the organization. After receiving the order, my brother borrowed 7,000 yuan from private sources to carry out repairs, which have now been completed. It has been eight months since the preparations began in December last year, and fortunately they have been successful. In the future, we must strengthen the rectification so that military prisoners can enjoy practical benefits and be silently transformed. All colleagues should also pay attention to both kindness and strictness at all times, regard themselves as nannies, regard prisoners as babies, and educate and care for them. At the time of the movement to recover legal rights, foreigners often use the excuse that Chinese prisons are bad and refuse to give up their consular jurisdiction in China. If prisons are improved, foreigners will have no excuse and Chinese rule of law can be completed. I hope to encourage all of you. The prison rations will be absolutely open, and a committee will be organized by the section chiefs and wardens to manage them in order to eliminate corruption. After the report, a photo was taken and the meeting was adjourned. Hu decided to take a plane to Beijing again on the 17th and then go to the front lines to meet Commander-in-Chief Jiang to report on the progress of the establishment and can return to Hankou in four or five days.

<h3>Further Request to the Anti-Smoking Association for the Abolition of the Hunan and Hubei Special Tax</h3>
<p>A submission to the Executive Yuan requesting the Ministry of Finance to promptly formulate concrete measures. The Central Anti-Smoking Committee previously received a letter from the Hubei Provincial Department of Finance's Special Tax Surcharge Collection Bureau stating that the bureau was in charge of the Hubei Province special tax surcharge, originally intended to incorporate prohibition within taxation, and requesting the committee to forward relevant anti-smoking laws and regulations. The committee, considering that the National Government's anti-smoking regulations adopted a policy of complete prohibition and that the Ministry of Finance established the Hunan and Hubei Special Tax Office also with the declared intention of short-term liquidation, and considering that the bureau openly claimed to incorporate prohibition within taxation, specifically raised the matter at the 48th regular meeting, resolving to petition the Executive Yuan to strictly order the Hubei Provincial Government to rectify this and to fundamentally abolish the Hunan and Hubei special tax managed by the Ministry of Finance in order to prevent imitation and spread. The original submission is excerpted below: The association has repeatedly read newspaper reports about the Hubei Provincial Government establishing a bureau to handle the special tax surcharge and is currently investigating. It recently received a letter from the Hubei Provincial Department of Finance's Special Tax Surcharge Collection Bureau stating, "Our bureau is in charge of the special tax surcharge, originally intended to incorporate prohibition within taxation, in order to gradually purify it and to assist your esteemed association's wishes," which caused great consternation upon review. It is found that incorporating prohibition within taxation was a policy previously employed but is not adopted by current anti-smoking laws and regulations. The current anti-smoking laws adopt a complete prohibition policy, which is fundamentally incompatible with the policy of incorporating prohibition within taxation. Therefore, even though the Ministry of Finance's management of the special tax in Hunan and Hubei claimed to be a short-term liquidation, the association, fulfilling its responsibilities, repeatedly requested its abolition. Although the Ministry of Finance has not yet complied, it still has not dared to openly display the four characters "incorporating prohibition within taxation" with the same degree of absurdity as the bureau's original letter. Such an open alteration of national prohibition policy is even worse than the Ministry of Finance's liquidation of the special tax. Who brings about such hardship? One can only sigh with deep sorrow. Law is a public matter for the entire nation. Under the governance of the same government, how can it be permitted to arbitrarily alter it according to one's own inclinations? If today anti-smoking laws and regulations can be disregarded and thrown into chaos, then all laws can be cited as examples and treated as mere documents. What will the government rely on to implement policies? What will the people follow? This does not seem like a phenomenon that should exist in a nation ruled by law. However, the reason why the Hubei Provincial Government dares to establish a bureau and openly declare incorporating prohibition within taxation is merely using the Hunan and Hubei special tax as an excuse. The way to manage national finances lies in increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and there are many ways to achieve this. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for financial management and should carefully plan. Why must it repeatedly extend the limitation of the special tax, constantly incurring disapproval? If quenching thirst with poison were possible, it could still be said. But now, not only is the thirst not quenched, but the poison is spreading. The Hubei Province surcharge is clear evidence of this. If this precedent is set and not strictly curbed, it is feared that Hubei Province will do this first, and other provinces will imitate it, further relaxing the prohibition of opium and collapsing the defense of the law. The consequences are too terrible to contemplate. The association's duty lies in focusing on the difficulties of the time and daring not to remain silent. This was raised at the 48th committee meeting of the association, which resolved to petition your esteemed Yuan to strictly order the Hubei Provincial Government to rectify the establishment of the special tax surcharge and earnestly request the Ministry of Finance to promptly formulate concrete measures to fundamentally abolish the Hunan and Hubei special tax in order to prevent imitation and spread. Therefore, this document is respectfully submitted, hoping that you will review it carefully, considering the inviolability of the prestige of the law and the impossibility of relaxing the opium prohibition policy, and promptly issue instructions for implementation, which would be truly in the public interest and convenient for implementation.</p>
<h3>Korean Army on the Jiaoji Railway Reaches Changle</h3>
<p>Jin Army Retreats to the West of the Zi River</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The allied Korean-Li army on the Jiaoji Railway has been fiercely battling the Jin army for several days. On the 11th, at Shen time (3-5 pm), General Cao Fulin's Korean army repelled the enemy west of the Bailang River. That evening, they recovered Weixian. Zhao Xinzai's brigade, which had been besieged in Weicheng, was finally relieved and cooperated with other units to pursue the enemy towards Changle. On the 12th, the vanguard of the Korean army had reached Changle Station. The headquarters of the First Army Corps had moved from Zuoshan Station to Weixian to conduct business. It is reported that the Jin army did not offer much resistance this time and retreated westward. Their rear guard is still covering the retreating troops in the area of Yaogou Tan Family Workshop, intending to abandon the areas east of the Zi River and retreat to the west bank of the Zi River, where they are currently setting up defenses.</p>
<p>Due to the Korean army's progress, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau specially dispatched the Chief of the Transportation Department, Tan Shukuai, and the Chief of the Engineering Department, Deng Yiguang, on a special train westward on the 12th to inspect the situation along the railway line in order to facilitate the restoration of the original condition. Tan and Deng returned to Qingdao yesterday and reported everything to the Railway Bureau. Furthermore, trains from Qingxi westward have been able to reach Fangzi from today (the 14th). The Qingdao Station has issued a notice to inform the public. (August 14th)</p>
<h3>Yong Sheng Ferry in Guangdong Sunk by Bandits</h3>
<p>Over Thirty Passengers Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Yong Sheng ferry, which travels between Guangzhou and Jiangmen, was bombed by bandits with a water mine at Chencun at 10:30 pm on the 11th, resulting in over thirty deaths and injuries. The details are as follows: There are a total of five ferries operating on the route between the provincial capital and Jiangmen: Guangfa, Yuanfa, Daan, Yong Sheng, and Yong Xing. Recently, the waterways have been unstable, and bandits have been rampant. Therefore, anyone with assets traveling between Jiangmen and the provincial capital has been transferring to Hong Kong ships, daring not to directly take the ferries. Passengers have long regarded the danger of the waterways as a perilous journey. On the 11th, the Yong Sheng ferry of the Xingye Company was fully loaded with cargo and passengers at the Xihao Pier in the provincial capital. At 8 pm, it was towed by the Zhongxing steamer. At 10:30 pm, when it arrived at the Sifangwen Pagoda near the Chencun Ping Mountain Highway, it was suddenly bombed by bandits with a pre-planted water mine. The explosion was deafening. The bow of the ferry immediately sank into the water. Fortunately, there was a lot of cargo, so it did not capsize, otherwise, the consequences would have been even more disastrous. The galley cabin and the women's cabin, which were connected to the bow, were blasted with a large hole. A large part of the kitchen in the bow was also destroyed. At that time, it was already late at night. All eleven crew members on the ferry had gone to sleep in the galley cabin, and most of the twenty-two passengers in the women's cabin were also asleep. The incident happened suddenly, so the passengers in the galley cabin and the women's cabin were all killed or seriously injured. Five male passengers and seven female passengers were also seriously injured. The crew members who died were torn to pieces, a truly gruesome sight. At the time, the ferry was floating and sinking on the water, which was extremely dangerous. The Zhongxing steamer that was towing the ferry immediately turned around to rescue it, pulling alongside the ferry and securing it with ropes. At the same time, the Yong Xing ferry, which was traveling from the province to Jiang, passed by and immediately rushed forward to help. After several attempts, they managed to dock the bombed ferry at the Chencun shore. They immediately began rescuing the drowning passengers on the river surface. The crew of Yong Xing sent people ashore to report to the defense troops stationed in Chencun. The defense troops, upon hearing the report, immediately led a large force to protect the area. The local militia, upon hearing the news, also rushed to help. When the militia arrived, they sent the injured to Chencun for treatment. The passengers who escaped danger transferred to the Yong Xing ferry to Jiang. The dead were placed ashore to await collection. According to the ferry office staff, there were no passengers in the dining room that night, twelve passengers in the main cabin, and twenty-two passengers in the women's cabin. The cargo was about 80% of its capacity. About two hours after departure, they heard a loud explosion, and the entire ship shook. The passengers in the main cabin, although not killed, were greatly frightened. Fortunately, the moonlight was very bright that night, and there was no gunfire from the shore, otherwise, the deaths and injuries would have been even more severe. At that time, the guards on the ferry saw that the ferry had been bombed and immediately fired rifles and small cannons at the dark areas on the shore. However, there was no return fire from the shore at this time, indicating that it was not a robbery but rather a means of intimidation. They immediately began rescue work. The number of deaths and injuries was about several dozen, sixteen female passengers and about twelve male passengers. Among the injured, five male passengers and seven female passengers were seriously injured. The number of slightly injured has not yet been determined. According to Xingye Company staff, the bombing of the ferry was caused by bandits extorting waterway passage fees unsuccessfully. The company has received no fewer than one hundred bandit extortion letters. If these extortion letters were all paid, the company's entire capital would not be enough to distribute to one or two. Therefore, they had no choice but to ignore them, while strengthening the self-defense capabilities of the ferry and petitioning the government for protection. Before the ferry was bombed, its self-defense capabilities were extremely strong. The wheelhouse and the gun turrets on the ferry surface were all covered with three-point-thick steel plates. The rifles and cannons were extremely sharp. The twelve gunners and guards on the ferry were also extremely skilled. The bandits, unable to find an opportunity, vented their anger and carried out this bombing. It is said that the bandits who planted the water mine were the gangs of Zhang Dingji and Luo Ji Hong. Currently, the Shipping Association believes that the waterways are unstable and bandits are rampant, and the ferries are in a dangerous situation. They have decided to convene a meeting of ferry merchants tonight to discuss ways to defend against them. (12th)</p>
<h3>Bandit News from Yancheng, Funing, and Xinghua Counties</h3>
<p>Ma Yuren, the former military governor of Huaiyang during the warlord era, has repeatedly sought to stir up trouble since being disarmed, but he has not dared to act rashly because he had no opportunity. Recently, due to Yan Feng's betrayal of the central government, he sent people to offer flattery in the hopes of obtaining an official position, while instigating his henchmen Liu Hanmin (Ma's brigade commander) and Wang Zhaowu (Ma's battalion commander) to secretly transport military supplies from the coast into Yancheng and Funing. However, due to the limited number of guns and lack of strength, they were divided among bandits such as Le Tuzi, Jiang Zhenghuang, Zhou Zhengbang, Li Xiaobai, Qi Heshizhi, Wang Xinfu, Qi Dashao, and the former police squad leader of Yancheng County, Wu Jinbiao, to collect guns from villages and towns. Furthermore, due to insufficient funds, they resorted to kidnapping and extortion for huge sums of money. Not only were towns such as Yangjiaji, Donggou, Fenggu Village, and Qinggou in Funing spared, but Yancheng suffered the most. It is estimated that over two hundred villages have been looted. Towns such as Shagou, Anfeng, Dagang, and Shanggang were occupied and burned. Dozens of kidnappings occurred daily. The villagers, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled aimlessly, with nine out of ten houses empty and the sound of weeping filling the air. In particular, the ripe autumn harvest was abandoned in the fields, and no one dared to reap it. Yancheng, Funing, and Xinghua counties have suffered from famine for three years. This year, there was a slight prospect of harvest, but it cannot be harvested. It is foreseeable that the number of starving people will be even greater than in previous years. Bandits also emerged in Baiju and Liuzhuang in Xinghua. Previously, a captured bandit scout (captured by the Yancheng County police team in Xiaopanwan, Yancheng) confessed that Ma was the 16th Route Commander and 27th Army Commander appointed by Yan, plotting to disrupt the rear. Currently, all ferries in Jiangbei have suspended services, transportation is obstructed, and travelers are having a hard time. In Yancheng and Funing, the four rural areas have been devastated, and the county town is also in danger. If heavy troops are not dispatched quickly to suppress them, it is feared that they will spread and the bandit areas in northern Jiangsu will become difficult to eradicate, which will also have an impact on the overall situation.</p>

<h3>Regulations for Dredging Rivers in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department, in view of the fact that the province is located downstream, is subject to the accumulation of silt from the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and the backwash of tidal currents, has always suffered from silting. To this day, dredging and clearing ditches has become the most important task in water conservancy construction. However, the interests of various counties differ, and river management often involves constraints, or suffers from financial constraints, and large-scale projects cannot be realized. Furthermore, the lack of unified authority and incomplete planning lead to numerous malpractices and repeated disputes. Fearing that the rivers will remain unmanaged for a long time and that floods and droughts will never end, the Water Conservancy Bureau was ordered to formulate seventeen articles of interim regulations for dredging rivers, taking into account the actual conditions in various counties, and to order the counties to comply. The regulations are recorded below: (Article 1) For rivers within a county that need to be dredged, the local people may petition the local construction bureau to plan the dredging. (Article 2) The topographic survey, engineering planning, and fundraising for the rivers in the preceding article shall be handled by the Construction Bureau. (Article 3) After the Construction Bureau has drafted the engineering plan, budget, construction details, and fundraising methods in the preceding article, it shall submit them to the County Magistrate for approval by the Construction Department for implementation. (Article 4) For smaller projects</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Burning of Changsha by the Communists [T13]2[/T]</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Prelude to the Reconstruction of the County Prison: The county prison is dilapidated and overcrowded, leading to frequent jailbreaks, which is quite dangerous. Chief Judge Lin of the High Court recently planned to improve six county prisons each year in stages. The construction cost will be allocated from a 50% price increase on legal documents up to 10,000 yuan, with any shortfall to be raised locally. The county prison is listed in the first phase of reconstruction. Special Commissioner Shi came to Songjiang yesterday (the 16th) and met with County Magistrate Jin at the county government. County Magistrate Jin then convened a meeting of representatives from local public groups and agencies. County Magistrate Jin reported Commissioner Shi's mission to Songjiang. Commissioner Shi then stated the general idea, saying that the prison is a place for reforming criminals. Now that consular jurisdiction has been recovered, it is urgent to gradually improve prisons to avoid excuses that hinder the recovery. The dilapidated and overcrowded county prison is also inhumane. Raising funds to repair the prison is not only a new construction for the locality but will also be eternally appreciated by the prisoners. He hoped that leaders from all walks of life would assist to achieve success. He then reported that the High Court allocated 10,000 yuan. The future architectural design will be a double-I shape, accommodating 300 people. All equipment will follow the new prison standards, including workshops, a lecture hall, a bathhouse, and a sick ward. It is estimated that the cost will be about 15,000 to 16,000 yuan. In addition to the funds allocated by the High Court, the shortfall was discussed by the public. It was decided to use the old prison's wood and the wood from the abandoned Central Military Command Post as materials. If there is still a shortfall, it will be raised from the ten districts. The abandoned Central Military Command Post is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the High Court will request the provincial government to consult the Ministry for allocation. After the discussion, Commissioner Shi returned to Suzhou to report.</p>
<p>Principals of Various Elementary Schools Resign Due to Funding: The funding standards for elementary schools in the county have always been allocated according to the low-level standards promulgated by the former Central University. The budget for the 19th year was still sent according to the previous session and was approved by the administrative meeting of the Education Bureau. However, the Education Department instructed a reduction and ordered resubmission. The principals of various elementary schools believed that the Education Department disregarded the facts and arbitrarily reduced the budget, making it impossible to maintain operations. Today, they discussed and decided to submit a collective resignation at the Education Association and will issue a declaration stating the difficulties. It is unknown what measures the education authorities will take to properly resolve the matter.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Water Police Cooperate to Suppress Lake Bandits: At 2:00 PM on the 16th, the 14th team of water police in Wujiang received a report from detectives Xu Jintang and Xu Ziyuan that there were six or seven bandit boats and dozens of bandits in the area of Sanjin Majiadang, nine miles from Wujiang.

<p>Two Ships Robbed En Route: The Yangjian ship, which travels between the city and the countryside in the 8th district of the northeast township, was robbed twice last year. Unexpectedly, the ship was coming from the countryside to the city the night before last, and four bandits suddenly stood on the shore at Anzhen, shouting to board the ship. The captain, Zhang Xiaorong, thinking they were passengers, immediately stopped the ship and docked. The four bandits immediately jumped down and sat calmly in the ship without making a move. When they arrived at the Banqiao port near Xintangqiao, the four bandits pulled out their pistols and searched the passengers and the captain on the ship, robbing them of more than 40 yuan in silver, 15 yuan in paper money, more than 20 jiao in small silver coins, as well as passengers' clothes, silver jewelry, etc., totaling more than 200 yuan. After half an hour, the four bandits took the loot and went ashore with a shout. Furthermore, the Qianhuang ship, which travels from the county to Changzhou, was sailing from the countryside to the city in the afternoon before last. It was suddenly encountered by a bandit ship with eight bandits at Sanbaidu, a place on the border of Changzhou and Xishan, at midnight. The bandits spoke in local accents, carried pistols and Mauser pistols, fired shots to intimidate, and rushed onto the ship, overturning the cabins and searching at will. They then took the loot across the ship and escaped. After the incident, the ship owner Xu Xizeng and the captain of the Yangjian ship Zhang Xiaorong both came to the city one after another to report to the Shipping Association, which reported to the county government to investigate and seize the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Fifth Sub-Bureau Seizes Fake Brigade Commander: Police officers from the Fifth Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau seized Wei Kun, a reactionary fake brigade commander, while checking passengers at the riverside. They found a seal, a commission, and dozens of business cards, with the title of the Second Brigade Commander of the Second Army Corps for Suppressing Rebellion. They were immediately taken to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. As the case was related to reactionaries, they were sent to the Provincial Security Department for punishment.</p>
<p>Bandit Alert at Gaozi Xuwang: At about 6:00 PM on the 15th, about 30 bandits suddenly came to Xuwang, 13 li from Gaozi, and surrounded the village, attempting to seize the militia's firearms. The village head reported to the garrison stationed at Gaozi, which requested the garrison stationed at Zhenjiang to send a team to suppress the bandits. The company commander of the Zhenjiang station, Liao Dingfan, immediately led two platoons of Mauser pistol soldiers on a small train. When they arrived at the scene, the bandits had already fled. The village has now implemented martial law to prevent the bandits from coming back to disturb the area.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Rescuing Kidnapped Men and Women for Ransom: Along the coast of Luxi and Juegang, over forty men and women have been kidnapped by sea bandits. The ships are anchored on the waters of Shayu Tingzi Port, Sanjia Town. The Nantong police and military, together with the navy, are jointly suppressing the bandits to rescue the hostages.</p>
<p>Providing Comfort to the Families of Militia and Police Killed in Action: Over ten militiamen and police officers from the 4th Battalion of the Provincial Security Regiment, including Peng Haitao, were killed in action while suppressing bandits in Nantong.

<p>Tense Situation with Bandits in Jiuhuashan: In Jiuhuashan, at the border of Nantong and Rugao counties, about seven or eight hundred bandits claiming to be Red Army soldiers have gathered in recent days, burning and looting extensively and encroaching on the Pingchao area. On the 16th, the 3rd Regiment Commander Li Changjiang came to Nantong to ask County Magistrate Zhang to dispatch the security team under his command to suppress the bandits. Handling Riverbank Protection and Collapse Prevention Projects: The riverbanks of the Yao and Wang ports in Nantong are collapsing severely. The Construction Bureau is rushing to build revetments and soliciting funds from the shipping industry to rescue the situation. On the one hand, it is first constructing the Second Jiangjian. Furthermore, the riverbanks of Changyinsha Island have recently collapsed severely. The island is jointly administered by the three counties of Nantong, Jiangyin, and Changshu. The three counties are currently jointly handling the riverbank protection project and are in negotiations.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Water Police Caught Transporting Opium; Jiangyin, being close to the Yangtze River and having many harbors, has always been a hub for opium. Recently, the fortress headquarters, to prevent bandit ships on the river, specially organized patrol boats to cruise the river. On the 15th, Special Agent Ji Yongxiang, while patrolling the Jiangbei Sanxu Port area, saw the Yihua Company's Lianhe ship sailing downstream. At that time, there were three river lights on top, one red and two all white. He also saw three river boats closely approaching the river ship. The river ship suddenly dropped several small yellow tarpaulin packages. The three river boats tried to retrieve them. At that time, Li Shaoming, the squad leader of the seventh squad of the Sanguan Police Station, who was stationed there, was also patrolling the Huangshan Port area by boat. He saw the river boat also approaching and interrogated it. Because he saw armed men protecting one of the river boats, he went with the fortress patrol boat and found out that it was a water police patrol boat protecting and transporting opium. Chen Bingquan, the squad leader of the water police fifth district twenty-second brigade patrol boat, and four officers, seeing the soldiers of the fortress, did not dare to resist. They confiscated fourteen packages of opium, weighing nineteen pounds each, from the four boats. Four boatmen, four water police officers including Squad Leader Chen, and opium dealer Qiu Zanqing were temporarily detained. At dawn, Commander Yang of the fortress interrogated them first. In the afternoon, he sent a letter to the county government, and County Magistrate Li and Trial Officer Yang organized a military court to jointly try the case. Commander Yang first reported that the water police team was one of the local military and police organs to maintain order, and that public officials were transporting opium, so he specially organized a military court to try the case. Squad Leaders Ji and Li first reported the details of the investigation, followed by boatman Pan Rong, who confessed that Chen Bingquan and a water police officer hired the boat to go to Erxu Port to pick up the goods. During the pickup, both sides used flashlights as a secret signal to pick up a large package, not knowing how much. The boat's engine was what I operated. Boatman Lu Changfa confessed that opium dealer Qiu Zanqing hired the boat to go to Bu Port to unload the goods at about one o'clock. Xu Luo, Pan Bingsheng, and others confessed that they worked as boat crew for Chen Changfa and Pan Rongfu. Then the water police, Hua Hanbing, Zhang Yinglin, and Li Yuqing, all confessed that Chen Bingquan, also known as Bingquan, ordered them to sail the boat to Sanxu Port and Liuxu Port to dock, and that at about eleven o'clock, a river ship came, and our boat used a flashlight as a signal to throw down packages of goods, etc. When Chen Bingquan was interrogated, he stated that he received the order from He Zhan'ao of the brigade headquarters, saying that when checking opium, if they recognized it, they should take money, and if they did not recognize it, they should take the opium. Last Saturday, he received an order from Captain He to go to Wuchang by ship to pick up the goods, which were picked up for Zhang Motian, who lived next to the Jiaotong Hotel. He did not know how much money Captain He received. He received twelve yuan in protection fees. This time, the goods belonged to opium dealer Qiu Zanqing, and Captain He ordered him to pick them up. He did not know how much opium there was. He had not received protection fees either. He hired the small boat. The water police Liu Hanbing and Wang Bingsheng followed the small boat. I used the small boat to grab the opium on the big ship. Qiu Zanqing initially denied being an opium dealer, but after repeated and strict interrogation, threatening him with military law and beatings with military sticks, and with Chen Bingquan's confirmation, he confessed that he was thirty-one years old, from Hubei, and currently living in Jingjiang. He was working as a runner for Yang Jingzhi. The opium was loaded on the Lianhe ship. Yang lived outside the east gate of Jingcheng. A woman opened a tea shop in Baxu Port. The opium was loaded in Hankou and was a joint venture of the ship's stewards. We resold it and got some commission, selling it in Jiangbei. Each time, it was three or four hundred taels. Yang Jingzhi and the water police negotiated the pickup. The protection fee was not fixed, thirty or twenty yuan, depending on the amount of goods. It was approximately one fen of silver dollar per tael of opium. After the interrogation, they were detained separately. Commander Yang and County Magistrate Li telegraphed the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Provincial Government, and the Department of Civil Affairs for review.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Young Girl Playing with Fire Causes Disaster; Yesterday, at the home of Gu Bu, a farmer in Zhongzhuang Ham, Yuwei District, a county of Jiashan, a fire was started by her young granddaughter playing with fire which spread to the mosquito net. In an instant, it burst through the roof. Although the villagers were alerted by gongs and rushed to put out the fire, the weather was dry and it was difficult to extinguish. Two houses with eight rooms were destroyed. The young granddaughter was unable to escape and died in the fire. Gu Bu was carrying items and was burned, and her life may be in danger. The total loss is estimated to be about three or four thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Cargo Ships Collide, Father and Son Drown; Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, at the Dizao Tangkou of Xitang Beixiang, the firewood boat of Hu Xiaoli of Liantang, fully loaded with rice straw, was on its way to Xiadian Temple to sell the straw. Suddenly, a mountain goods boat sailed towards it with full sails. Unable to avoid it in time, it crashed head-on and capsized. His son, Longfu, and Hu both fell into the water and drowned tragically.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Security Teams from Extorting Money; The Zhejiang Provincial Government recently investigated that various battalions of the security teams, when ordered to move or set off to suppress bandits, have been requesting supplies and extorting subsidies from local organizations and groups. This is harmful to military discipline. In addition to issuing a strict order to the subordinates, a public notice is issued to strictly prohibit such actions.</p>
<p>Continued Loan of 300,000; The Zhejiang Department of Finance stated that the central government is urging the payment of the subsidy funds, but after checking the treasury, there are only more than 50,000 yuan, making it impossible to meet the demands. They have no choice but to borrow another 300,000 yuan from the financial sector, using the cloth donation from all over Zhejiang as collateral, to be repaid in installments in May.</p>
<p>Chief of Public Security Bureau Transferred to Province for Training; Zhu Jiahua, the head of the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province, believes that many chiefs of public security bureaus in various counties are weak in ability, so they will be transferred back to the police academy for training. It is reported that nine people, including Zhang Shouyu, have been transferred back.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen and Xiong Shihui Arrive in Hangzhou; Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, and Xiong Shihui, the Commander of the Songhu Garrison, arrived in Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 16th at 10:00 PM. Provincial government officials went to the station to greet them and lodged them in the Xileng Hotel.</p>
<p>Chaoshan to Establish Meihua Elementary School; Chaoshan, in the Xiqiao area of Tangqi, Hangzhou, has been known for its plum production for the past thirty years. However, the rural atmosphere is closed and there is no place to study. Sixty percent of the children in the village are illiterate. Now, Shan Dong Yingrui and Kang of Taishan are discussing with Wang Ruilong of the Chaoshan Cemetery to establish Meihua Elementary School there, using the plum blossom viewing pavilion of the cemetery as the school building. Chen Wannian, Shen Yongquan, and Pang Fengzhang have been appointed as school directors to actively prepare for the project. In the future, the children of ordinary villagers there will have a place to study, which will be of great benefit.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Chief of Public Security Bureau Repeatedly Accused; Li Yuan, the chief of the Linpu Public Security Bureau, has been repeatedly accused by the people due to public dissatisfaction. Last time, he was accused by merchants Lu Huaiqing and others of various misdeeds. The provincial government ordered Du, the county magistrate of Xiaoshan, to investigate and reply. Then, the chief of the fourth district was commissioned to conduct a secret investigation nearby. Unexpectedly, recently, he was again accused by merchants Shen Qi and others of various misdeeds, including running gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens. The Department of Civil Affairs ordered Du, the county magistrate of Xiaoshan, to conduct a second secret investigation. Yesterday, the county government ordered Wang Guanhua, an assistant at the Fourth District Office, to investigate each of the accusations in detail in order to submit a report to the province.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Pirates Rob Cargo and Injure People; The merchant ship Jin Maosen, registered in Fujian, loaded with more than 1,500 packages of groceries from Fuzhou on the 9th of this month, arrived on the 14th at about 4:00 AM, passing through the Ligang waters outside Zhenhai. Suddenly, three pirate ships appeared. Dozens of pirates, armed with guns and knives, swarmed onto the ship and robbed more than 900 packages of groceries and more than 4,700 yuan in silver. A ship's boy, Zheng Ruifu, resisted slightly, and the boy was shot and killed by the pirates. Zheng was severely injured in the shoulder and arm by the pirates.

<h3>Comparison of Primary School Expenses in Various Counties of Jiangsu Over the Years</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Joint Preparatory Office for Compulsory Education has compiled statistics on the primary school expenses in various counties of Jiangsu over the years and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for verification. The Ministry of Education highly praised it and issued it to various provinces and cities for reference. The main points of the statistics are excerpted below: [T13]一[/T]The total economic amount of various counties in Jiangsu in the first year of the Republic of China was 1,389,894 yuan. In the 17th year, the total expenditure was 4,198,498 yuan. Compared with the previous year, there was an increase of 2,808,604 yuan, which is approximately equal to the total expenditure of the 13th year. [T13]一[/T]The expenses of each year generally increase year by year, but the 15th year decreased by 245,482 yuan, which was due to the initial arrival of the National Revolutionary Army in various parts of Jiangsu and the entry into a state of military affairs. Moreover, it was also due to the division of Nanjing and Shanghai into special municipalities. [T13]一[/T]The increased expenses of each year are mostly greater in the more recent years, but when comparing the increased expenses of the 3rd, 6th, 10th, 12th, and 13th years, they are not as much as the increased expenses of the previous year. [T13]一[/T]The year with the largest increase in expenses was the 17th year, with 907,214 yuan, and the year with the smallest increase was the 3rd year, with 44,383 yuan, with a difference of 862,831 yuan, which is more than double. [T13]一[/T]The years in which the expenses of each county increased without decreasing were the 8th, 9th, and 12th years, followed by the 11th and 14th years, in which only one county decreased. In addition, the increases and decreases varied, especially before the 6th year of the Republic of China. The progress after the 16th year was relatively uniform. Among the 17 years, only Lishui County had increased expenses without decreasing. The other counties, such as Changshu, Rugao, Jiangning, Jurong, Baoshan, Kunshan, Funing, Yancheng, and Dongtai, only decreased one to three times in the early years of the Republic of China. [T13]一[/T]The county with the most expenses in the first year of the Republic of China was Wujin, with 94,510 yuan. The second was Shanghai, with 89,829 yuan. The third was Yixing, with 71,155 yuan. The least was Yangzhong, with only 500 yuan for the whole year, followed by Lishui, with 5111 yuan. [T13]一[/T]The county with the most expenses in the 17th year was Wuxi, with 300,968 yuan, followed by Wujin, with 219,301 yuan. Wuxing was listed after the 20th county. The least was Yangzhong, with 4,632 yuan, followed by Suining, with 6,138 yuan, while Lishui had increased to 17,532 yuan. [T13]一[/T]The counties with expenses below 1,000 yuan in the first year of the Republic of China were all in the Xuhai, Huai, and Yang areas, totaling 22 counties. By the 17th year, only Yangzhong and Suining had less than 1,000 yuan, while there were 59 counties and 1 municipality with more than 10,000 yuan. [T13]一[/T]The county with the least increase in expenses was Jiangpu in the 7th year, with 2 yuan, and the most was Suzhou in the 17th year, with 167,230 yuan, or Wuxi with 130,799 yuan. Since the 16th year, each county has increased the mu donation for universal education, so the free education expenses have suddenly increased.</p>

<h3>All Schools in the County Re-divided into Two School Districts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Sixth District schools were previously divided into three school districts by the County Education Bureau, and one supervisor and two education commissioners were assigned to inspect in rotation. The bureau believes that this method is inappropriate and has decided to change it to east and west school districts starting this year. The first, third, and sixth districts (former Minbei Zhuanma Four Townships) are the west school district, and the second, fourth, and fifth districts (former Caotang Three Chen Four Townships) are the east school district. However, because there are too many schools in each school district, it is planned to have the principals of the central schools be responsible for inspecting the distributed schools in the central school district and report to the bureau for verification. All administrative responsibilities will still be borne by the education commissioners.</p>
<h3>Summer Work of Labor University Students</h3>
<p>More than 50 Iron Beds Manufactured in the Factory, and Agricultural Crops Will Also Be Harvested in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Most of the students of the National Labor University stayed at the school during this summer vacation. The school pays great attention to the work of the students and has made precise arrangements and guidance in advance. At the same time, it has also applied to the Ministry of Education to designate factories for second-year students to practice outside the school, but has not yet received a reply. Therefore, they are all working in the school's farm and factory, and the results are quite impressive. The students of the engineering college have manufactured more than 50 iron beds and many agricultural tools. The students of the agricultural college have planted vegetables, melons, fruits, rice, and wheat, which have been continuously harvested and are extremely abundant. The students of the Social Science College are running a people's school with more than 100 students, which will expire soon and a parent-teacher conference is scheduled to be held on the evening of the 19th of this month.</p>

<h3>New Era for Women's World</h3>
<p>Women's swimming competitions have never been held in Shanghai, and even the National Games have not set up this program. Although the Hongkou swimming pool is lively and competitive, there has never been such a thing. Therefore, last night's women's group opened a new era for the sports world of Shanghai women. The audience paid special attention during the competition. Ms. Liu Mali won three first places in a row: 20-yard freestyle (repechage), 20-yard breaststroke, and 20-yard backstroke. Her posture was beautiful and her results were excellent, which was truly rare. There were also the Chen Saixuan and Chen Baoxuan sisters, who were only nine and ten years old. Wearing vermilion swimsuits, their dives and jumps were excellent. The audience applauded. Baoxuan (the elder sister)'s backstroke was only inches away from Ms. Liu Mali's. Ms. Shao Jingying and Li Dihui were also very excellent.</p>
<h3>Little Heroes Competing in the Water</h3>
<p>More than ten children in the children's group competed fiercely, with very little difference in the 20-yard freestyle and 20-yard backstroke. The splashing water made it impossible to distinguish the winner. The little heroes are expected to win glory for our country's swimming.</p>
<h3>Women's Group Finals Results</h3>
<p>The women's swimming competition was the first of its kind in East China. The results of the finals that night showed that Ms. Liu Mali won three first places and stood alone.

<h3>Shanghai International Tennis Rotary Cup Preliminary Round Second Act</h3>
<p>England and Portugal Win Completely; Japan Wins Three Straight in Singles, American Doubles</p>
<p>Five Countries Play Today</p>
<p>The second act of the Shanghai International Tennis Rotary Cup preliminary round was held at the Chinese Tennis Court yesterday. Although the weather was bad and it rained occasionally, the competition was completed. The audience was also quite enthusiastic. As a result, England and Portugal won completely in singles. Japan won three straight against the American doubles. Japan now has a three-to-one advantage.</p>
<h3>England Beats Switzerland</h3>
<p>England's Stokes defeated Atwell, who, though physically imposing, lacked stability in his ball control. Atwell, despite being young and strong, was no match. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(England) Stokes 61 61 61 Atwell (Switzerland)</p>
<p>In another match, the English White Waves faced the Swiss White Instruments. The White Waves easily won the first set 6-1. From the second set onwards, White Instruments became more aggressive, putting up strong resistance, leading to a tense battle of fourteen games before a winner was decided. White Waves won 8-6. In the third set, White Instruments showed no improvement, and White Waves won three sets straight. The score is as follows:</p>
<p>(England) White Waves 61 86 61 White Instruments (Switzerland)</p>
<h3>Portugal Beats Germany</h3>
<p>In the singles matches between Portugal and Germany, both victories went to Portugal. Portuguese players Puttin Taffers defeated Germany's Eberhardt, and Korea Zhou defeated Kraulo. After one set, both German players withdrew, one due to old age and the other due to obesity preventing them from running.</p>
<h3>Japan Beats America</h3>
<p>In the singles matches between Japan and the United States, each side won one. Yesterday, the doubles match was held, the outcome of which was crucial. The American players were Squia and Hennes, while the Japanese players were 　 and Matsunaga. The American Squia was reasonably strong, with a powerful serve, but his other shots lacked precision, and Hennes was mediocre. The two could not cooperate effectively, leading to poor positioning. The Japanese team was stable and coordinated well, with few errors in high balls and smashes. The match was tense, but the American team made many mistakes, spoiling the spectacle. As a result, the Japanese team won three sets straight and now leads 2-1 overall. The doubles results are as follows:</p>
<p>Matsunaga 64 64 64 Squia Hennes (USA)</p>
<h3>Today's Schedule</h3>
<p>Starting at 4:30 PM</p>

The schedule is as follows: two singles matches between Japan and England, one doubles match between England and Switzerland, and one doubles match between Germany and Portugal.</p>

<h3>Results of the County First District Football Championship</h3>

The Luoxia team was organized by students from Minhang studying abroad and was also quite strong, but lacked coordination. The Pujiang team was organized by colleagues in the rice industry and was established only three months ago, but its performance was already remarkable. After the Luoxia team won the championship, the First District Party Department and the First District Office held a celebration banquet last night, gathering dozens of athletes together.

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A: Why is your health so poor, always catching colds?</p>
<p>B: It's all because of that pug dog of yours.</p>
<p>A: How strange! You catch a cold, what does it have to do with my pug dog?</p>
<p>B: Yesterday I came to your house, and your pug dog wagged its tail in greeting. The wind from that tail fanned into my nose, so I caught a cold.</p>
<p>Police Chief (to one of his detectives): I clearly instructed you to report at 11 o'clock. Why are you arriving after 12 o'clock now?</p>
<p>Detective: Chief, it's not my fault. It's just that I was tailing two thieves. Somehow, they stole my watch. Without a watch, how could I report on time?</p>
<p>Teacher (lecturing, suddenly hears laughter from the students): Who dares to break the rules?</p>
<p>A student (standing up to answer): It was me who laughed, but I didn't mean to.</p>
<p>Teacher: You dare to argue that you didn't mean to?</p>
<p>A student: It's really like that. When I laughed, I quickly covered my mouth with my sleeve. I didn't know there was a hole in my sleeve, so the laughter unknowingly leaked out.</p>
<p>Servant: Master, there's a guest who wants to see you.</p>
<p>Master: Good, give him a chair to sit on.</p>
<p>Servant: One chair isn't enough. He wants to take all the furniture in the whole reception hall. It's said that it's because the master owes a debt that hasn't been paid.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Xu Garden</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Six Yang Dao Ren Ding Yu paints landscapes near Shigu, often depicting scenes of Sichuan, as fine as meticulous embroidery. He once asked me to write a poem for a painting certificate, and I wrote a seven-character ancient poem in the style of my old friend Pan Lan Shi, which I inscribed on the painting report, along with the poem: "Ten thousand miles of lonely clouds have not yet returned, the autumn atmosphere permeates the universe. I trust my temperament suits the wilderness, but I deeply regret that my strength is inferior to Jing Guan. The bald old tree's branches are still strong, the shaved steep cliff's rocks are turned mottled. A piece of worldly heart cannot be completely eliminated, so I will use my rat whiskers to paint Mount Wu." In the year before last, I intended to go to Sichuan with Jiang Jun Fengge, but ultimately did not because of many entanglements. Now that I have this painting to serve as a mental journey, the clouds of Mount Wu need not only be seen in dreams. This brush was given to me by Fengwu, and one side of it was written by Li Tianzhen with three poems of grief about the Gengzi year. The calligraphy is as beautiful as the Sui and Tang dynasties, like the Dong Meiren Stele. The poems are close to the thatched cottage of Huanhua, saying: "Do not ask about career for a thousand autumns, abandoned armor and broken spears fill the barracks. Scolding thieves, the Taishou has no face. Who will continue the Martial Marquis in pacifying the barbarians? The ups and downs of life are the tears of heroes, the shattered Qian dynasty is the worry of soldiers. When will the Wang Hui pass on the grand event? Heaven teaches all foreigners to come and play. The eight formations of the river bank cover the crows, the flowing water滔滔feels the passing years. Suddenly, it is said that the demon atmosphere raises powder and rouge, how can the war bones be exposed to the yellow sand? The cool and desolate whistle wind is miserable, the dim banners and flags are slanted by the sun. Even if the Zunlu cannot return, Yuanming has already failed the yellow flowers. The current situation is difficult, what can be done? Alas, the sea water is rising again. Heroes have always recorded their achievements early, and prime ministers have always misled the country. There is Liangping in the seat, difficult to decide the victory, the army is not Guo Li, moreover, it hurts harmony. The rise and fall of fortune return to the number of days, looking back at Qin, the tears are like a torrent." Li Jun is also a native of Sichuan, who has come to Shanghai for many years, selling books without seeking high prices. There are those who use the market to solicit books for huge sums, fearing that he will not be willing to sign his name, so they ask Fengwu about it. Li Jun said that it is limited to the domestic goods stores set up by the Chinese people, and the cost of the brush is also waived. It is good to hang it on the national gate, and it naturally has its reputation, just like Liu Yang Daoren's paintings. He spends several days' effort, and writes thousands of mountains and valleys, only taking ten gold, just for a drunken indulgence. Compared with the madmen who splash ink, and mark the price of a thousand gold, the distance between greed and integrity is so far away, how can it be measured by distance?</p>
<h3>Record of the Jingwu Association's Sea Trip</h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>At this time of high summer, the humid heat is steaming, and confinement in the city is particularly depressing. The travel group of the Shanghai Jingwu Physical Education Association, in order to seek summer pleasure for its members, specially organized a sea trip last Sunday (the 10th). It chartered the Laifeng steamer to take a pleasure cruise outside Wusongkou to enjoy the cool breeze. The number of participants was originally limited to 500, all of whom were members of the association and their families. The fee was 50 cents per person, half price for family members, and free for children under ten years old. I am not a member, but as a member of the press, I was also welcomed to join.</p>
<p>The Participation is Enthusiastic. After 2 p.m. that afternoon, travelers boarded the ship one after another. The ship was berthed at the Jinliyuan Wharf. When I arrived, it was already past 3 p.m., and more and more people were arriving. Many people who had not registered in advance bought tickets on the spot to join, so the quota was exceeded. A total of more than 600 people arrived. After everyone boarded the ship, they went to the upper and lower floors to find seats. Before long, the seats were full, and not a few people were standing on the ship. This shows that many people want to escape the heat in the hot summer.</p>
<p>The Arrangement on the Ship. The Baofeng Ship had been arranged in advance, and it was quite orderly. It was divided into an office, a Chinese music section, a Western music section, a snack section, a cold drink section, etc. Guests who wanted to eat Western snacks, ice cream, drink soda, etc., could get it immediately. It was no different from a temporary small Western restaurant. People could travel without hunger and thirst. This was also due to the proper handling of affairs by the association's staff. More than a dozen Chinese Boy Scouts were also transferred to the ship to provide guidance and maintain order.</p>
<p>The Serenity of the Voyage. It was just half past three. With a whistle, the ship started to set sail. The Boy Scouts played music at the same time. The ship then left the shore and sailed slowly. The guests were full of energy. Female guests accounted for almost half of the travelers, and there were also twenty or thirty children. The female guests were mostly young and beautiful, and their clothes were gorgeous. For a time, the aroma of clothes and hair filled the ship. Everyone leaned on the railing and gazed. The sides of the ship were crowded with no space. Traveling along the coast, the tall buildings and giant mansions were lined up one after another. The Bund is the most refined area in Shanghai, and it can be seen at a glance. It is very spectacular. Along the way, Chinese and Western music were played at the same time, and the melodious sounds were enough to please the mind. Especially a certain lady's high-pitched song was the most pleasing to the ear. At this time, the scorching sun was in the sky, but the river breeze was gentle, caressing people's clothes. The heat was slightly reduced.</p>
<p>The Scenery of Wusongkou. After browsing for a while, I realized that I had reached Wusongkou. Looking at my watch, it was just 5 o'clock. The boat went forward again, straight out of the mouth. Taking advantage of the wind and waves, the speed suddenly increased. A vast ocean, boundless. And the setting sun was in the west, and the colorful clouds suddenly spread out. Distant sails were dotted, faintly visible. The natural beauty is like a beautiful brocade. Before long, the smoke and waves were vast, and the sky was already dark. The boat then turned its rudder and sailed back. Everyone was still looking far away.</p>
<p>Watching the Bright Moon on the Sea. Chang'e appeared and disappeared, gradually rising in the east, becoming a large jade plate, brightly illuminating the sea. The floating light shines on the water, making it golden yellow, and the slight waves are rippling, creating an infinite sense of beauty. Suddenly, the floating clouds covered the toad light. Looking up, it had passed Yangshupu. The bustling sea was lit with thousands of lights, magnificent and dazzling. After enjoying the cool for a long time, the dust was completely washed away. The returning boat also docked by the shore. Everyone then returned with great interest. It was 10:30 p.m., which was the scheduled time. This trip lasted seven hours. The scenery of the Huangpu River was appreciated a lot. Such a wonderful trip cannot but be recorded. So I recorded it like this that evening.</p>
<h3>The Spirit and Interest of Ball Games</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhenchao</p>
<p>Recently, people in Shanghai have a keen interest in various ball games. Whenever there is a match between strong teams, they all compete to be the first to watch, creating seas of people. This is evidenced by the matches between the Lehua Football Team and the Luxwethart Summer Team, the battle of the Tianjin Nankai Five Tigers Basketball Team, and the matches between tennis stars Lin Baoxian and Qiu Feihai. The number of spectators always exceeds ten thousand or thousands, causing a sensation far and wide. The spirit of various ball games is different, and the interests are also different. Therefore, I will describe them in detail as far as my limited knowledge goes.</p>
<p>The Mighty and Majestic Football. Among the ball games, football is the most in line with the battle formation of the army. There are forwards, there are defenders, and in the middle, the central defender stands upright, providing support in all directions. Supplemented by left and right midfielders, the formation structure is almost the same as in the army. Whenever the five forwards attack in a line, the left and right wings advance together, charging into the enemy ranks, like a bamboo in a storm, its majesty and majesty is unparalleled. Among the ball games, the most interesting to Shanghai people is football. The matches between the Lehua and Western Football Clubs always attract six or seven thousand spectators. Among the fans, there are those who forget to eat and sleep because of this.</p>
<p>The Infinite Array of Basketball. Basketball is similar to football, but the court is small. One uses feet, and one uses hands. There are also forwards, and there are also defenders. The basketball court is small and easy to defend, so it must be played quickly, and its infinite array is also the most interesting. The five-person defense is like a copper net. If there are individual defenses, ethical retreats and guards, long throws and short throws, unpredictable changes, it is also the most interesting ball game.</p>
<p>The Division of Labor and Cooperation of Volleyball. It is said that people in North China love basketball, then volleyball should belong to South China. Their volleyball team has held the Far East Games championship for many years. The volleyball organization is composed of three rows of three people each. The front row is in charge of defense, called blockers. The middle row is in charge of attack, called hitters. The back row is dedicated to saving the emergency, called rescuers. Each performs their duties, in an orderly manner. This is the principle of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>The Aristocratic Color of Tennis. Tennis is an individual sport, and cannot be played by several people in mixed matches. The racket and ball must be prepared by the individual, and the value of one racket is expensive, costing forty or fifty gold. Inferior ones cannot be used. Those who play tennis must also dress neatly, paying attention to aesthetics. They always take materials such as white serge, so it is called aristocratic color.</p>
<p>Accuracy and Agility of Baseball. Baseball must be played with accuracy and agility. Holding the bat to hit the ball, you must be accurate. Abandoning the bat and occupying the base, you must be agile, otherwise you will be killed. The pitcher, catcher, shortstop, and baseman must also have accuracy and agility as their main skills. Otherwise, mistakes will be made everywhere. Americans know this skill best. Babe Ruth has the accuracy of the Baseball King, and the Japanese also love it like crazy. It is a pity that Chinese people still pay little attention to it.</p>
<p>Other ball games such as golf, hockey, bowling, and rugby are known to fewer people in China, and those who practice them are also rare.</p>
<h3>New Knowledge for the Family</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>I like to plant more than a hundred peach trees in the gaps of my home garden. In the past, when the peaches were about to ripen, I used newspapers and other things to wrap the peaches to protect them from insects. However, the paper was thin and of poor quality, and after being hit by rain and wind, it would often break, and three or four out of ten peaches would still be damaged by insects. This year, I used the paper bags of Invincible brand toothpaste to wrap them (one bag of toothpaste has two paper bags, which can wrap two peaches). All the disadvantages are slightly reduced, and the remaining fragrance of the toothpaste still has the effect of repelling insects. Those who grow peaches may wish to try it. (Heaven)</p>
<p>Invincible brand butterfly cream is a new product of the family industry society. Its excellent quality has long been praised by people in the society and does not need to be described. I did not expect that it is not only a wonderful product for moisturizing the skin, but also a good medicine for treating burns. I was unfortunately burned on the back of my hand a few days ago and suffered great pain. I accidentally applied butterfly cream to the affected area, hoping to relieve the pain. I did not expect that the affected area immediately felt unusually cool after application. So I applied it once or twice a day, and after three days, it was cured. It is truly an outstanding cosmetic. (He Beihong)</p>
<p>Blotting paper is a necessity for daily use in the study, but it all comes from foreign countries, and the outflow of money is not small. At this time of expensive gold and silver, the price is even higher. Little do they know that there are many substitutes available immediately. The Sanyou Industrial Society issues toilet paper made by paper mills. This paper is white and soft, and has a wide range of uses. It has great water absorption and can also be used instead of high Tess. The value is far apart, and the effect of disinfection and deodorization is even better. This is another new knowledge for the family. (Yang Shaopeng)</p>
<p>Kerosene often has the drawback of being mixed with water. You can use carbolic acid liquid (that is, stinky medicine water that has not been mixed with water) to apply it to a strip of paper and use it as a water detection paper. If the kerosene is mixed with water, the part with water will immediately turn white when it encounters it. (Work)</p>
<h3>Recent Events in France</h3>
<p>— Liu Zeng,寄於巴黎</p>
<p>The replies from various countries to the French government's memorandum on the European Union have largely arrived. Countries such as Poland and Romania, whose diplomatic policies originally followed the lead of the French government, naturally have no major objections. Moreover, the implementation of the actual system of the alliance not only greatly benefits these small and weak countries economically, but also provides an additional layer of security for their national independence. Therefore, the replies from these countries, in addition to expressing full support for the French proposal, have repeatedly stated that the alliance system should be based on guaranteeing the security of all countries and absolutely respecting the integrity and independence of their territories.</p>
<p>Those with more research value are the replies from Italy and Germany. The Italian reply, from the overall point of view, is gentle in tone, which is beyond our expectations. The reply first stated that the Italian government is prepared to participate in the discussion of the alliance system. Secondly, the Italian government added some annotations to the French reply and expressed various opinions, such as respecting the sovereignty of small and weak countries and treating defeated countries equally. Italy believes that the European Union should be limited to not infringing on the existence of the League of Nations. Countries that have not joined the League of Nations, such as Soviet Russia and Turkey, should be allowed to join the European Union. Finally, Italy stated that if the main purpose of the European Union is to establish a close cooperation among all countries, then the issue of military reduction should be resolved first. If we read the Italian reply carefully, we can see that the Italian government is always prepared for France's ambition to dominate the European continent, so it strives to expand and change the French original plan, and speaks for the small and weak countries and the defeated countries in particular. The issue of military reduction that it raises is almost entirely for France.</p>
<p>The German reply is roughly similar to the Italian reply, such as respecting the sovereignty of the League of Nations and hoping for the accession of Soviet Russia and Turkey, which are in line with the Italian government's views. However, the German reply has an important characteristic, that is, it secretly advocates treaty revision. The reply is modest in attitude and cautious in wording. Although the issue of treaty revision is mentioned repeatedly, the language is mostly satirical and not explicitly stated. However, discerning people will know it at a glance. The first section of the reply states that the purpose of the alliance is to engage in a bold transformation in the spirit of reconciliation and to enable Europe to obtain a true peace that can only be established on the basis of justice and equality. Secondly, it also says that all plans to improve the European political situation depend entirely on whether the following guidelines can be used as a basis for transformation. These guidelines are the overall equality of power and harmony, equal security for all countries, and peaceful harmony between nations. Now that the conditions of survival conflict with these guidelines, effective methods should be sought to correct them, and so on.</p>
<p>In short, the European Union is needed by all countries in terms of finance, but they all have their own different interests, so they cannot agree on their views. For example, the treaty revision movement implied by Germany is difficult for France to recognize. The accession of Soviet Russia and Turkey is also a problem. It is heard that the relevant countries will continue to discuss this matter at the Geneva International League this autumn. There are many difficulties ahead, and the period for realization is very far away.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (Sixty-Seven)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Visiting the Palace of Versailles (Part Two)</p>
<p>What a grand and magnificent palace. The floors are paved with countless small wooden blocks of different colors, forming various patterns and displaying bright colors. It stretches over twenty yards in length. The caissons are all frescoes, adorned with dazzling gilded carvings. The doors and windows are made of thick glass, with countless white stone statues lined up on both sides. This was once the dance hall of Louis XIV. One can still imagine the scene from the height of Louis's reign, with nobles and aristocrats, beautiful women in brocade, and famous actors and actresses, dancing and singing on this radiant floor. We have already ascended the stairs. Continuing inside are banquet halls and bedrooms. Oh, what enormous three paintings. They depict Napoleon's presentation of eagles and Napoleon's heroic posture on horseback. The former is the work of Jacques Louis David, and the latter is the work of his esteemed student, Gros. There is another one whose author is unknown. David was Napoleon's chief court painter. These are massive works completed under Napoleon's command, extremely realistic portraits. They are now placed in the grand hall of Versailles to allow the world to admire the demeanor of that great hero and also serve as valuable material for art historians. The paintings are impressively large, and the extremely complex compositions can make one dizzy. Napoleon stands on the left, wearing a red velvet coat, raising both hands, as if giving a speech. Surrounding him are dozens of figures, holding eagle-headed banners, all displaying great reverence. Another large hall is engraved with gold on all sides, with a throne set up under a canopy, surrounded by copper railings. This is probably where the emperor received audiences. The brilliant gold tones are still enough to make us imagine the solemnity and splendor of the time. Behind that is the bedroom, with more than a dozen chambers, all with beds and sitting areas. The furnishings are exquisitely beautiful. The desks, mats, and carpets are all original items from Louis XIV. Obtaining even a single desk or mat in a foreign museum would be considered a treasure. Seeing them here, it's truly unremarkable. Passing through more than a dozen halls, all are densely arranged with frescoes. It is truly a magnificent sight. Because there are too many, I cannot remember the names of all the artists. Fortunately, the emphasis here is not on the paintings themselves. The original intention was to highlight the events depicted in the paintings. All the grand ceremonies and major events of French queens and concubines from the past, along with war scenes with various countries, are gathered here. I can only give a general overview. Look at this one, a picture of Louis XVI being forced to sign his abdication during the Revolution. Oh, isn't that one a picture of the two parties killing each other after the revolution? It includes a portrait of Madame Roland. Madame Roland, as beautiful as an orchid, is captivating. But incense and jade are burned together, and genius and mediocrity are consumed in the same flames. No matter how wise or foolish, all talented people are reduced to ashes. Looking up at them, we still feel unbearable sorrow. Others include the ascension of Louis XIV, the ceremony of attending the parliament, the arrival of the Spanish king Philip IV at the Rhine River, and Napoleon meeting the Russian Emperor Alexander. Another hall hangs a picture of Louis XVI reviewing troops and a picture of the gathering of ambassadors from various countries in 1856 and the enthronement of Napoleon III. Looking up at them, there is a kind of solemn feeling that is difficult to express. Whether they are enemies or allies, British emperors or tyrannical kings, virtuous rulers or despots, as long as they have caused great disasters in history, they are all depicted here one by one. This is truly a rigorous history.</p>

<h3>Financial: Last Week's Gold Market Fluctuated Greatly</h3>
<p>Concealing a Waning Nature</p>
<p>Difference Reached Twenty-Three Taels and One Mace. The gold market situation last week continued to be weak and sluggish. However, there were sudden rises and falls, with daily fluctuations ranging from six or seven to ten or more taels. This made people feel uneasy and aimless, drifting with the wind. This was probably because the rollover was approaching, and both long and short positions were mutually controlling and refusing to yield. The multi-party coerced and the short-party blackmailed the receipt of cash, which led to the market price rising. However, the shorts were unwilling to be suppressed and preferred to settle in cash. Therefore, the price fluctuated irregularly. As for the overseas silver market, it tended to heat up and lengthened, and the foreign exchange rate also increased by two increments (half a penny). Therefore, from the beginning of the week, it fluctuated around seventy taels. Later, due to short covering and long additions, it once reached the eighty-tael mark. By Thursday and Friday, it was mostly caused by longs such as Hengxing Shengda selling off, because the silver price and drafts were lengthened. Suddenly, the wind turned downwards, and it suddenly broke into the sixty-tael mark. However, by the weekend, the situation was seen to be easing, probably because the major firms were scaling back, especially since it coincided with the rollover. Therefore, it was violently raised and had coaxed out of the seventy-tael mark. However, the price of the October market was less than ten taels lower than the September price. Therefore, a rollover suddenly occurred, an unprecedented situation, which caused the longs to pay up three to ten or more taels, a strange event. The market was particularly chaotic, and the shorts were hit hard. It was found that the high and low in these six days of September totaled twenty-three taels and one mace, compared to the previous week of six (August 9), a further decrease of four taels and seven mace. As for October, due to the rollover, new transactions were very rare, but the price fluctuated by as much as ten and a half taels in half a day (because it was a half-day trading session on Saturdays). The settlement price, calculated according to the daily gold price, should be more than sixty taels below. The spot price initially increased by six or seven taels, and by the weekend, due to the rollover, it had been increased by a multiple of fourteen or fifteen taels. It is feared that someone will receive it. The overall situation of these six days from Monday (August 11) to the 16th (weekend) is described below.</p>
<p>The Lowest Peak Seen at Fifty-Seven and a Half Taels. On August 11 (the beginning of the week), the silver market rebounded, and the drafts increased by half an increment. The internal market was also seen to be loosening. The real gold price immediately opened lower, calculated at 573 taels and 9 mace. Later, major players competed to buy, and the price rose sharply, reaching 78 taels and 4 mace in the afternoon. The market closed and softened again, calculated at 74 taels and 9 mace, which was still 2 taels and 6 mace lower than the previous Saturday, and the difference between the high and low prices was 5 taels and 4 mace. The next day, the silver market continued to lengthen, and the first order increased by half an increment. As for the gold price, the falling trend became more intense, once breaking into less than 70 taels, only 65 taels and some odd mace. However, buyers were active, and the Nissho Bank also stepped in to chase. In the afternoon, Dihu came out at 70 taels, also with a rise of 7 taels. The falling trend on Wednesday finally stopped, with consecutive declines for four days, reversing the direction. However, the silver market was no more beautiful. Although the silver price increased, it was not taken seriously. The internal market was seen to be firm, especially due to short covering, fearing stimulation during the rollover. In the afternoon, it once jumped to eighty taels, and it was rumored that the long party was receiving cash. By the next day, the major firms scaled back, but the foreign exchange market tended to loosen and discount. In addition, Taikang Runzhi Xingyong Hu and others tended to sell, and the sharp edge of the long side was suppressed, and the price fell miserably by more than ten taels, suddenly breaking into less than seventy taels. On that day, there was a difference of ten taels and two mace, and Hengxing Shengda suddenly sold off. The next day, the silver market suddenly lengthened, with the 1875 silver price increasing by 0.625, and the HSBC listing followed suit, increasing by one increment. The daily gold price fell by 0.0175, which caused the gold price to fall immediately, and sellers from various firms emerged. The market suddenly broke into less than sixty taels, only calculated at fifty-seven and a half taels. However, later, more buyers were seen, and the foreign exchange market had turned mild, a clear sign of loosening and leveling. Therefore, by the afternoon, it had been pulled up by ten taels, closing at 66 taels and 7 mace, which was only a decrease of 9 mace compared to the previous day, also with a reversal of ten taels. On the weekend, it happened to be the rollover, and the major firms scaled back by 0.125, and people's hearts rose. The market opened high and had penetrated out of the seventy-tael mark, reaching eighty taels and six mace. The afternoon closed at 72 taels and 8 mace, but there were no transactions, all based on the October listing as the standard. Generally, October was the main focus. However, the rollover was unexpectedly large, reaching ten taels. Therefore, October was eight or nine taels away. It initially opened at 64 and a half taels and then increased to 71 taels. At noon, selling pressure was strong, and it fell sharply by more than ten taels, to 60 taels and five mace. As a result, it was pulled up by three or four taels to 63 taels and 8 mace, and there was a turnover of ten taels and five mace in half a day, causing the spot price to rise due to the rollover. It is heard that the current market inventory is about 20,000 or more units. The changes in the market situation are particularly difficult to predict. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets and drafts are listed below:</p>
<p>Type Highest Lowest Change from Last Saturday Major Firms (Near Term) 16.5125 pence 16.25 pence Increased by 0.025 Major Firms (Far Term) 16.2125 pence 16.25 pence Increased by 0.03125 US Silver Price $0.55625 $0.5475 Increased by $0.0075 Bombay Price 47 rupees 0.035 46 rupees 0.09 Increased by 0.04 British Exchange Rate 1 shilling 6.775 pence 1 shilling 6.375 Increased by 0.5 pence US Exchange Rate $18.5025 Increased by $0.12 Japanese Exchange Rate 2 taels 3 mace 0.025 1 tael 2 mace Decreased by 0.025 Gold Price 80 taels 6 mace 557 taels 5 mace Decreased by 4 taels 7 mace</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's London telegraph reported that the trend of the three-quarters and four-quarters of major silver was still uncertain. The near and far terms rebounded again by 0.0625, both at 16.25 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling 7.1875 pence in British gold). A New York telegraph also reported that the US silver price also rebounded by 0.125, with the spot price calculated at $0.5375. The British exchange rate against the US dollar increased by 0.0625, and the US dollar against the British pound rose by 0.03125, both at $4.8715625. The Japanese exchange rate against the US dollar was still at 49.4375. The British exchange rate against the Japanese yen was still calculated at 2 shillings 0.0375. The British exchange rate against Shanghai was still calculated at 1 shilling 7.375 pence. The Bombay spot price increased by 4 annas, calculated at 47 rupees 0.01 anna.</p>
<h3>Slight Turnaround in Silver Dismantling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bank holiday caused money shops to feel slightly constrained in their use of funds in the market. Therefore, the silver dismantling price suddenly turned strong. The morning market was 0.04, and the afternoon market was 0.07, a sharp increase of 0.05 compared to the previous day, a very normal trend. However, bank collections were suspended due to the holiday, so there was no news. The money industry market made a clearing price of 7 mace 0.0295 in the morning market and 7 mace 0.029375 in the afternoon market, which was slightly smaller by 0.00125 compared to the previous day. The remittance amount made was 243,000 in the morning market and only 163,000 in the afternoon market. There were no purchases of banknotes inside or outside the field. The money shops collected more than 2.7 million in foreign silver orders and more than 2,900 orders in silver orders. Remittances from various routes totaled more than 400,000. Small money shops traded more than 300,000 in foreign silver. The auxiliary coin market was 6 mace 0.052 in the morning market and 6 mace 0.048 in the afternoon market for Jiangnan small silver, a decrease of 0.0004. The trading volume was 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver was 6 mace 0.0195 in the morning market, an increase of 0.0075 compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 140,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were changed to 389,000 for every 1,000 coins.</p>
<h3>Securities Public Debt Soared on the Weekend</h3>
<p>The Market Situation Remains Good, with a Turnover of 51.8 Million.</p>
<p>The spot market for securities and public debts was as deserted as before. Only 42,600 yuan was opened throughout the week, with each of the six series of repatriation funds accounting for tens of thousands of yuan, and the rest only accounting for thousands of yuan. The forward market was still good. Except for 5.7 million on Tuesday and less than 5 million on Wednesday, it was more than 8 million on Monday and more than 7.7 million on Thursday. The market was extremely prosperous on the weekend, and the market atmosphere was very lively. 10.31 million was opened on Friday, and 15.1 million was reached on Saturday. The total turnover was 51,825,000 yuan, an increase of approximately 1.7 million yuan compared to the previous week. The most active trading was in customs duties, repatriation funds, and demobilization funds. The repatriation funds accounted for 7.195 million yuan in August and 10.13 million in September. Customs duties accounted for 6.2 million yuan in August and 7.995 million in September. Demobilization funds accounted for 4 million yuan in August and 8.625 million in September. The resettlement funds were also still good, accounting for 2.47 million in August and 2.475 million in September. The reorganization of the six percent bonds accounted for 875,000 yuan in August and 465,000 in September. The performance bonds accounted for 525,000 yuan in August and 345,000 in September. Other debts were also very limited. There was no market for long-term seven-year bonds throughout the week. A total of 209,000 yuan was traded in Series 25, and 245,000 yuan was traded in 96 public bonds. The financial bonds amounted to 80,000 yuan. The price of bonds fluctuated slightly and peacefully. There were mutual gains and losses on the first day of the week. From Tuesday to Thursday, the market situation was depressing due to the turbulent situation, and the market sentiment was abnormally weak. Sellers always dominated the market. The customs duties, repatriation funds, and demobilization funds were all under pressure and gradually weakened, with the decline quite strong, falling by around 2.5 yuan one after another. However, on the last two days of the weekend, the market situation changed dramatically. The military news from Shandong Province was good, and the Jiaoji-Jinpu lines achieved successive victories. The sentiment was optimistic, and buyers rushed to buy. Therefore, demand exceeded supply, and the price rebounded rapidly. On Friday, customs duties, repatriation funds, and demobilization funds all rose by around 2-3 yuan. The resettlement funds and Series 25 also rose by 1 yuan and several jiao. On the weekend, it rose again by 1 yuan and several jiao to 2 yuan. However, the reorganization of the six percent bonds, financial bonds, seven-year bonds, 96 bonds, and performance bonds had subtle fluctuations throughout, and although they also rose slightly compared to the previous week, the amount was only a few jiao.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Consumption Was Extremely Weak Last Week</p>
<p>Amidst Confusing Times, Customer Sales Became Quieter. Under the Heavy Pressure of American Cotton, Human Bids Became Unstable.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn sales were exceptionally quiet last week, and all groups showed no signs of excitement. This was because the overseas cotton yarn market was uniformly weak, trending downwards. The domestic situation was unstable, and wars were raging, so business came to a standstill. However, the Cantonese group, which was the most active the previous day, also showed signs of dispersion. However, buyers were very strong in their high-sightedness because they expected a bumper harvest this year, and the pulling force was still fierce. However, the world cotton industry was unbearably weak, and all countries were overproducing. American cotton gradually discovered new low prices, and people's hearts did not seem to be affected by it. Therefore, a part of the sellers sold off when there was stagnation, and the attitude of manufacturers was flat, with no intention of rebounding. It is said that the Shanghai factories still have more than 100,000 bales of yarn in stock. It was found that most of the yarn bought by the Cantonese group was transferred and stored. Judging from the general trend, the market price of cotton yarn is difficult to stabilize. At present, because the season is in autumn, the long party insists more and more, and there will be no major loopholes for a while. However, the general trend is that it is difficult for a single tree to support it. American cotton plummeted by more than 30 pounds on the weekend, and the sound was 1.6 cents. This kind of scene is rare in recent years. It is feared that the price of standard yarn on Monday will have a sharp drop. It was found that the total number of bales bought by various groups throughout the week was 4,505, and the number of bales bought by counterparts was 1,435. The price of the market fell by more than one or two taels. The price of the standard yarn was still firm because the long party tightened it and refused to let go. Later, the actual demand was dim, American cotton was unstable, and people's hearts softened and fell back. The price of each month fell by one or two taels compared to the previous week. The total turnover throughout the week was 78,250 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Sales Were Completely Stalled Last Week</h3>
<p>Factory Stocks Were Plentiful, with No Need for Procurement. American Cotton Was Declining, Actually Showing a Low Drop. The Standard Hankow Cotton Was Wavering, with a Tendency to Fall.</p>
<p>The sales of cotton were cut off, and the attitude of various factories was calm. In fact, the old cotton was enough to supply the factories, and there was no need to purchase it until the end of the year. Moreover, the new cotton was in very good condition due to the favorable weather. New cotton from Pudong Xinhua has been listed, and new cotton from Hubei and other places is also on the market. However, American cotton has been greatly reduced in sales, and the new flower situation is good, but the cloth and crepe transactions are sluggish, and the market price is gradually showing new low prices. However, the Shanghai futures market is firm, and the buyers tighten and refuse to let go from beginning to end. However, the general trend is that it is difficult for a single tree to support it. American flowers plummeted by more than 30 pounds on the weekend. It is expected that most of the next day will continue to fall for six days, and there is hope for a rebound. Therefore, the standard flower market is tight and the price is slightly up by one mace. However, according to reports, the number of collections has increased greatly, and the southern agricultural sets are sold. This kind of scene has a dramatic downward trend, and it is feared that there will be a special drop in the price of cotton in the future. The standard cotton market has tightened due to long pulling, and in addition, the foreign cotton has stepped down, and people's hearts are slightly empty. As a result, the price of each month has fallen by five or six qian compared to the previous week. The total turnover throughout the week was 265,700 dan. The number of American cotton bales delivered to the碼頭 (wharf?) was 3,090. The number of manufacturers' advance futures was 4,940 dan, and the number of行號 (trading firms?) was 4,000 dan. The amount bought by each manufacturer and trading firm is recorded below.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Frequently Shows New Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was exhausted due to the large increase in the number of collections and the pressure of selling from the southern set sellers. The futures fell by 28 to 35 pounds, and the spot fell by 30 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 6 points, and the spot fell by 9 points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton fell by 20 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly with American cotton, but later softened due to local short selling. It is estimated that Pingle and Olmura fell by 3 rupees, Bairuoxi fell by 4 rupees, and the forward fell by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (16th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Steady Rice Market in Hexia (河下)</p>
<p>The number of rice boats arriving in Zhabei yesterday was still scarce, only about six or seven. Sales on this street were uneven. The North Geng market was stable, and the wholesale price of the higher grades was slightly reduced. There were no increases or decreases in the overall market. The source of early rice was not connected, and the situation was firm. The arrival of Dongxin Geng was thicker, but all were eaten by factory owners, and the market was numb. The market price was still 19.5 yuan. The new customers' sharp rice gradually saw connection, with a general opening of around 15 yuan. The goods this year were quite good. The arrival of Baiyuan (白元) was still not smooth. Although the market situation was said to be stable, the higher grades had to be repaired by one jiao.</p>
<p>There are not many sources to Shanghai South Hexia, and the way to go is flat. The goods of North Geng customers are especially wanting to shout high, but the buyer's appetite is weak, and the transaction is slightly moving. The price is the same as the previous day, but there are very few goods. Dongxin Geng also opened at 19.5 yuan here. There are only scattered goods such as sailing boats for thin rice. The higher grades are still 21 yuan, and the arrival and sales of Baiyuan are balanced.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Sales Were Still Difficult to Progress Last Week</p>
<p>The United States Also Reported a Drought, and the Silk Telegraph Claimed That Shanghai Was Gradually Scarce. The French Dealers' Purchasing Appetite Was Not Smooth, and the Price of Yokohama Japanese Silk Was Exhausted.</p>
<p>After the US sales launched through the Shanghai White Factory last week, it showed a firm and smooth trend. However, all silk-using countries in the world felt the impact of the precious gold and cheap silver, and changes occurred in the economic field, resulting in a weak appetite for silk purchases. For example, artificial silk, and the United States recently experienced a drought, and the sales of raw silk have plummeted. The silk telegraph reported that Shanghai was gradually scarce, and the French dealers' purchasing appetite was not smooth. Yokohama Japanese silk merchants did not hesitate to sell existing silk and actively装出 (ship out?) to sell existing silk because of the abundant stock of silk, and the price of silk was still difficult to stand firm. There was a tendency to fall on the weekend. The opening price of the Shanghai Hua silk market was still high due to the shortage of raw materials. The Hua merchants insisted on stability. A total of more than 800 packages of forward and spot silk were traded last week, and more than 700 packages were exported. The price of overseas Hua silk fluctuated mutually due to exchange rate relations.</p>

<h3>City Party Department Actively Preparing for the Fifth Anniversary of Liao Zhongkai's Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Commemorative Meeting Scheduled for the 20th</p>
<p>August 20th marks the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Liao Zhongkai, a martyr of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee has specifically scheduled a commemorative meeting to be held at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 20th on the third floor of the Municipal Party Department, and is now actively preparing. In addition to notifying all organs, groups, and schools in the city to send four representatives to participate, all party members in the city are also ordered to attend on this day to express their condolences and encourage future generations.</p>
<h3>The Proper Understanding and Efforts Regarding Mr. Liao Zhongkai's Martyrdom</h3>
<p>1.  Mr. Liao was studious from a young age and never tired of learning. As he grew older, he devoted himself to revolution and always stood at the forefront of the times, leading the people to participate in the Nationalist Revolution. The fact that the Guangzhou farmers and workers have today such a well-organized organization, and are not being exploited by the Communist Party, is due to Mr. Liao's efforts. Therefore, when we commemorate Mr. Liao's martyrdom, we should emulate Mr. Liao's tireless pursuit of knowledge and strive for the farmers' and workers' movement.</p>
<p>2.  Mr. Liao had a great and pure personality, kind and sincere virtues, and the courage to fight and sacrifice. He managed finances in Guangdong for many years, remaining incorruptible. He followed the Premier in revolution, avoiding no dangers. He was approachable and kind in his interactions with others. Therefore, when we commemorate Mr. Liao, we should take Mr. Liao's spirit as our own spirit and Mr. Liao's personality as our own personality.</p>
<p>3.  Mr. Liao was a loyal follower of the Premier and the most disciplined comrade in our party. He shared hardships with the Premier throughout his life. He would rather sacrifice himself for the Three Principles of the People than live a life of inaction and compromise. He was able to obey the party's discipline, abide by the party's resolutions, execute the party's orders, and sacrifice all of his intelligence and talent to contribute to the entire party. When we commemorate Mr. Liao, we should earnestly abide by the Premier's teachings, obey the party's discipline, execute the party's orders, and sacrifice our individual intelligence and talents for the party, just like Mr. Liao.</p>
<p>4.  Mr. Liao assisted the Premier in reorganizing the party and groups for thirteen years, reforming the power structure, building the foundation for party governance, and assisting Comrade Chiang Kai-shek in establishing the Whampoa Military Academy to cultivate revolutionary military force. Mr. Liao used his own life to exchange for the foundation of the party and the country. Today, when we commemorate Mr. Liao, how should we continue the spirit of the party's thirteen-year reorganization to rigorously implement the party's program and promote the new life of the party and China?</p>
<p>5.  Mr. Liao worked hard to establish the National Government to unify military, political, financial, and civil affairs, and to seek the strengthening and stability of the revolutionary foundation. Therefore, when we commemorate Mr. Liao, we must strive to uphold the central government's policy of peaceful unification and overthrow the warlords, corrupt officials, and all reactionaries who undermine national unity and disrupt national finances, military affairs, and civil affairs.</p>
<p>6.  Mr. Liao had a will that said, "The reason why counter-revolutionaries arise is because they are utilized by warlords, bureaucrats, and imperialists. They may even personally collude with warlords, bureaucrats, and imperialists to try to overthrow revolutionary forces. This united war of the oppressive class is an inevitable symptom in the progress of the national revolution." The great Mr. Liao had foreseen the betrayal of the party and the country by the modern corrupt faction, the Xishan faction, and all reactionary elements. He also said, "Revolution is indeed our only way out. We must not only revolt against the warlords and imperialists, but also against the reactionaries. This is thorough revolutionary work." When we commemorate Mr. Liao, how should we follow Mr. Liao's will to strive for thorough revolutionary work?</p>
<p>Slogans: 1. Mr. Liao Zhongkai's spirit is immortal! 2. Continue Mr. Liao's revolutionary spirit! 3. Continue Mr. Liao's spirit of integrity! 4. Mr. Liao is the savior of farmers and workers! 5. Mr. Liao is the loving mother of the party's army! 6. Corrupt elements are not worthy of commemorating Mr. Liao! 7. Commemorate Mr. Liao by overthrowing imperialism! 8. Commemorate Mr. Liao by eliminating the traitors Wang, Yan, and Feng! 9. Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! 10. Long live the success of the National Revolution! 11.

<h3>Baoshan County Finance Bureau Raises Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Bei Jietai, the director of the Baoshan County Finance Bureau, received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, assigning a quota of 10,000 yuan in cigarette treasury bonds to be remitted to the province by a deadline. After receiving the order, Director Bei convened a temporary meeting yesterday at the county government with local public groups and the chiefs of districts one through five. As a result of the discussion, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce was assigned to raise 2,500 yuan, the Luodian Chamber of Commerce 2,500 yuan, and each district chief of the five districts was assigned to raise 1,000 yuan. However, since the Wusong Chamber of Commerce is now under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City, Director Bei visited Zhang Yuchi, Zheng Shushan, and other chairmen and members of the Wusong branch yesterday afternoon to request their assistance in raising funds so that the quota can be remitted to the province by the deadline.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Ordered to Expedite Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau has recently received repeated orders from the provincial government stating that due to heavy expenditures, the provincial treasury is in dire need of funds. It is imperative that the bureau director expedite the collection and remittance of various taxes, remitting them every five days without delay, lest penalties be incurred. After receiving the order, Director Wang immediately took steps to raise funds and remit them, and instructed the collection, assessment, and contract tax offices to inform the township chiefs and the public to be mindful of the difficult times and enthusiastically pay their taxes so that the full amount can be cleared.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Will Dispatch Troops to Suppress Communist Bandits in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>In Response to the Request of the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association in Beijing</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi, received a letter yesterday from the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association in Beijing requesting that troops be dispatched to suppress the Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province. The letter stated that they had received a letter from various legal entities in Wannian County, stating that the county's border with Yi and Gui is the gateway to Poyang and Yue, and has long been targeted by Fang Shao and other rebels. Since the failure of Peng's regiment of the 50th Division in Zhoufang last year, the two southeastern townships have been living in constant red terror. On November 1st, the pseudo-regimental commander Kuang Longhai led more than 300 men with guns to attack Zhulin, Meibei, and other villages. Wu Jinjian, the head of the defense corps, bravely fought the bandits and was killed by a bullet. Soon after, they attacked Fulin, captured Chenying, and broke Shigu Zhushan. The heads of the defense corps, Chen Yingshi and Fang Dazhai, died in the line of duty. In total, no fewer than 2,000 houses were burned, and no fewer than 1,000 civilians were killed. More than 3,000 households were destitute and displaced, exposed to the elements. The loss of property is beyond calculation. The flames have spread from the southeast to the northwest. The Jianxian Soviet government has implemented land reform in Fulin. In June of this year, the rebels Ma Ri-shao and Li Shangda led more than 1,000 men with guns and more than 3,000 men with spears to surround the county seat. Fortunately, the troops and police defending the city fought bloody battles for a day and night, killing more than 300 bandits before they retreated. Now that the early rice is ripening, the garrison is besieged in the city and unable to advance and suppress the bandits. Although the various public legal entities have repeatedly telegraphed their superiors for assistance, their pleas have been exhausted without response. If they continue to linger on, the civilians will either die under the iron hooves of the Communist bandits or die in the ditches along the way. Looking ahead, our grief only increases. You, sir, care about the suffering of the people and are concerned about the victims of the disaster. Your perseverance and enthusiasm are admirable. We earnestly request that you dispatch troops as soon as possible to suppress the bandits and celebrate the rebirth of the people. The kindness of your reconstruction will be etched in our hearts forever. After receiving the letter, Xiong Shihui decided to dispatch a considerable force to assist in the suppression.</p>
<h3>People's Whereabouts Record</h3>
<p>Xiong Shihui, the garrison commander of Shanghai and Songhu, and Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, took a train from Shanghai to Hangzhou the day before yesterday afternoon. After completing their official business, they took the ninth train from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon and arrived in Shanghai at 10:40 PM. It is reported that Commander Xiong went to Hangzhou during his weekend leisure to inspect the Shanghai-Hangzhou line.</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, Wei Daoming, Liu Ruiheng, Jiang Zuoqing, and Zhu Jiajun took the 11:00 PM night train from Shanghai back to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Two British Warships Arrive in Songhu from Weihaiwei</h3>
<p>One Goes to Hankou, One Stays in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the British cruiser HMS Berwick and HMS Bruce, the flagship of the 8th British Destroyer Flotilla in China, arrived in Wusong on the morning of the 16th from Weihaiwei. They were ordered by the naval commander to strengthen the British naval defenses in Shanghai and the Yangtze River area. After coal was loaded on the HMS Berwick, it sailed to Hankou in the afternoon to join the British cruiser HMS Columbine to await further orders. The HMS Bruce is currently docked in the Huangpu River to replace the HMS Sandtoft, which will go upstream in a few days.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: The Future of the Bureau and Its Current Business Situation</h3>
<p>The central government has transferred Chen Xizeng, the director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, to take over the position of director-general of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The reporter specially visited a section chief of the bureau to inquire about the recent situation of the bureau. According to a responsible person, the reporter was told that the bureau's ships were often docked and seldom sailing, resulting in a sharp decline in revenue and huge expenditures that could not be covered. Recently, after Wang Ziqian and Hong Yanbin left the bureau one after another, various loans made by the former director-general Zhao Tieqiao were being investigated due to inquiries from various parties. The most difficult problem now is how to repay the debts and issue salaries, which cannot be done with empty words. According to the current rescue methods, there are only two ways: 1. Unite with the commercial shareholders and ask the shareholders to contribute funds to maintain the existing bureau and prevent foreign shipping companies from taking the opportunity to encroach on it. 2. In accordance with the current situation of state-run shipping, the government should provide huge funds to enable the reorganization plan to proceed according to the established policy. Since the news of Chen Xizeng's appointment as director reached Shanghai, no personnel from the bureau have contacted Chen because they have not received formal documents. Recently, Shen Zhongyi and Li Yunliang, the section chiefs of the business section, still hold a positive view on the resumption of Yangtze River routes, eagerly soliciting cargo in order to maintain the shipping rights on the Yangtze River and prevent any decline due to the change of director-general. Therefore, the export cargo of the upstream Yangtze River ships has been able to maintain its original state in recent days. Cai Pei is planning to solve the problem of unpaid sailors' salaries soon.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Opium Cases Must Follow Formal Procedures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs approving the case submitted by the Anti-Opium Committee, stating that the responsible anti-opium agencies in various localities must follow proper procedures when investigating opium cases in order to protect human rights. Those who make false accusations will be punished accordingly. The laws are in place and difficult to change. Recently, it has been heard that the anti-opium agencies in various localities accept opium cases without obtaining a reliable report from responsible investigators or a complainant who has followed the formal complaint procedures. Instead, they use opium prohibition as a pretext to make unfounded accusations and arbitrarily search people's homes. If they find anything, they naturally claim the credit for themselves. If they find nothing, the innocent suffer. How can this be tolerated? Most of our people are kind and afraid of power, and dare to be angry but not to speak out. The punishment for false accusations is ineffective, and the laws are rendered useless. If this situation is not restricted, it will inevitably affect the opium prohibition and disturb the people. It is not in line with respecting human rights. After the aforementioned situation was raised at the 44th Committee meeting of this association, all anti-opium agencies in various localities must have a reliable report from responsible investigators or a complainant who has followed the formal complaint procedures before they can be granted a search warrant by the official government to carry out the search. Otherwise, the case will not be accepted in order to avoid false accusations. Those who disobey the above legal provisions or are found to be true upon reporting shall be punished according to law, and the direct superior of the responsible anti-opium agency personnel shall be punished accordingly in order to emphasize human rights and prevent criticism. The case should be recorded and sent to the relevant authorities for inspection and instruction, and the public should be informed of this order.</p>
<h3>The Problem of the Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Calling for a Temporary Executive Committee Meeting to Discuss Resignation and Re-election</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to all executive and supervisory committee members yesterday, stating, "We are writing to inform you that Chairman Xu has previously requested to resign due to illness that has prevented him from recovering immediately. After the second executive committee standing committee meeting on the 8th of this month decided to retain him, we received another letter from Chairman Xu requesting re-election. This was immediately submitted to the seventh standing committee meeting on the 14th of this month, which decided to convene a temporary meeting of the executive committee at 4:00 PM on the 20th of this month (Wednesday) to discuss and decide on Chairman Xu's resignation and re-election. This matter is important. We hope that you will be able to attend the meeting on time. Thank you."</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Investigation of the Red Cross Society Headquarters by the Municipal Health Bureau</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee Should Swiftly Take Responsibility for Reorganizing the Society's Affairs; The Chairman of the Board Should Swiftly Take Responsibility for Reporting the Rioters</p>
<p>Previously, the Chinese Red Cross Society had an incident in which rioters disrupted the general election of standing committee members and damaged the headquarters office. The central government considered the Red Cross Society to be a good charitable organization run by people from various countries and believed that this kind of irregular incident should be investigated. It telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct the Health Bureau to investigate all investigation circumstances. The Health Bureau considered that the Standing Committee of the Society was the highest body for supervising the Society's affairs during normal times and that it should have handled the matter of the methods approved by the central government and the electoral disputes within the Society. It specifically sent another letter urging Wang Yiting, the chairman of the Standing Committee, to expedite the investigation and report back so that it could be forwarded. Furthermore, it was ordered that the Chairman of the Board, Wang Peiyuan, be responsible for reporting all the rioters who disrupted the meeting and damaged the office, but he had not done so within the time limit. It sent another urgent letter urging him to do so so that it could be forwarded for review. The original texts of the two letters are transcribed separately below:</p>
<p>[T13]One[/T] Letter to the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Red Cross Society: "We are writing to inform you that we have previously received an instruction from the Shanghai Municipal Government forwarding the various follow-up methods for resolving the disputes of the Chinese Red Cross Society headquarters approved by the Chairman of the National Government. We sent a letter to your Standing Committee on July 25 of this year requesting that you inspect and handle the matter separately and reply for forwarding. We also sent a letter to your Standing Committee on August 7 replying to Jiang Qudan's defense and did not take the initiative to disrupt the Red Cross Society election. Please also expedite the handling of the previous matters and reply with details for forwarding. It is also noted that the temporary general meeting of the Red Cross Society members on August 10 was convened by your Standing Committee and its important task was to resolve the disputes over the election of standing committee members at the 3rd General Meeting of Members of your society, but the meeting failed to be held again and the dispute is still pending. We do not know how your Standing Committee will resolve this outstanding dispute and how the previous follow-up methods have been handled. We are sending another letter urging you to reply as soon as possible for review."</p>
<p>[T13]Two[/T] Letter to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Red Cross Society Headquarters: "We are writing to inform you that we have previously received instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Government forwarding the order of the Chairman of the National Government to swiftly urge you to report the rioters who disrupted the election of members of the Red Cross Society and damaged the headquarters office. We complied with this instruction and sent a letter to you on July 25 requesting that you comply with the instruction and fully report within five days of receiving the letter for forwarding and review. Subsequently, on July 31, we received a letter from Vice Chairman Yu of your society stating that Chairman Wang was supposed to reply on schedule but was bedridden with a serious epidemic and would reply after Chairman Wang recovered. We sent a special letter requesting your understanding. We have already verified that Chairman Wang is currently suffering from an epidemic and the deadline for replying can be extended slightly. However, we have received a clear order to swiftly urge you to report and we cannot delay for long. Now, it has been many days since the deadline has passed. Chairman Wang has recovered and was the chairman of the August 10 meeting. This reply only requires a straightforward statement of the facts and does not require much work. Please make a full report as soon as possible. If you continue to delay, we will report the facts of your repeated failures to take responsibility for reporting and request instructions for the final sanctions. Please reply truthfully as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Promulgates New Uniforms for Accountants</h3>
<p>Blue-Green Changed to Bronze-Green</p>
<p>The style of accountants' uniforms was previously promulgated by the National Government in June of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), with black clothing and blue-green trim. Recently, the Judicial Administration Ministry newly promulgated judge's uniforms with a green color that is completely the same as the accountants' uniforms. The Shanghai Accountants Association believes that it is difficult to distinguish members wearing uniforms to court in the performance of their duties. It was deemed necessary to make changes, and after submission to the fourth executive committee meeting, it was decided to change the blue-green trim to bronze-green for identification purposes. This was then submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for verification and implementation.

<h3>Preparing for the Second Labor Levy for Road Construction</h3>
<p>Instructions from the Jiangsu Construction Department</p>

With the Western Harvest approaching and the agricultural slack season arriving soon, all labor levy for road construction should be prepared immediately to allow for calm implementation.

In order to avoid repeating past failures, the department has formulated an implementation plan for the second labor levy for road construction. In addition to issuing separate orders, the bureau director is hereby ordered to prepare according to the order and schedule, without treating this as a mere formality. Director Wu, upon receiving the order, noted that the road to be constructed with the continued labor levy in this county is the Tianbei (Tianhua'an to Beiqiao) section, and has already instructed the Road Administration Office to prepare accordingly.</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Concerned about Public Drinking Water</h3>
<p>Planning Public Artesian Wells</p>
<p>The County Construction Bureau believes that the county's rivers are becoming increasingly silted up, with insufficient water volume. This is inconvenient for local residents to draw water, and may even be detrimental to hygiene.  Remedies are urgently needed.

<h3>Municipal Training Department Promulgates Measures for Party Member Training Competition</h3>

[T13]Four[/T] Each district branch must send one to three representatives to attend the lectures during the semi-final and final rounds. The lecture topics have now been issued and communicated to all branches for compliance.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Strictly Prohibits Levying Additional Surcharges on Goods</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has recently received repeated telegrams from merchants in various regions stating that local tax bureaus are levying extra surcharges on domestic and imported goods in addition to the taxes already levied, dealing a heavy blow to domestic products, the sales of which have already plummeted. With businesses on the verge of bankruptcy, it is difficult to bear these additional burdens. They request that consideration be given to the difficulties of merchants and that the tax bureaus of all provinces and cities be ordered to strictly prohibit the levying of additional surcharges on goods in order to reduce the burden on merchants and safeguard the future of domestic products. The Ministry of Finance believes that the local tax bureaus often levy taxes on goods without the approval of the Ministry of Finance, dispatching personnel to collect taxes privately, which goes against the principle of alleviating merchants' difficulties. As for the prohibition of levying additional surcharges, it is the only essential policy for promoting domestic products at present. Therefore, it has now issued a circular to the tax bureaus of all provinces and cities, ordering them to no longer levy additional surcharges on goods from the date of receipt of this order, under penalty of severe punishment. Furthermore, all tax bureaus are strictly ordered that in the future, any tax levied on goods must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and no personnel are allowed to be dispatched to collect taxes privately without approval.</p>

Two pirate ships approached from the left and right, surrounded the boat, and forty to fifty pirates jumped aboard, carrying guns and knives. They shouted in a northern accent, grabbing the crew members and asking where the boat owner was. Three crew members resisted slightly and were shot dead by the pirates. The remaining crew members had to lead the pirates to the front cabin, where they pulled Sun, the boat owner, to the deck and beat him, forcing him to hand over the silver dollars. Sun led the pirates to the bedroom and handed over a suitcase containing eight hundred silver dollars, but they were still not satisfied and searched the crew members, taking all the silver dollars they had. Before leaving, they kidnapped the boat owner, Sun, and one crew member to the pirate ship and told the crew that if they wanted to redeem them, they would have to pay five thousand silver dollars within half a month and contact them at the same location. The two pirate ships then sailed eastward into the sea. The Guo boat is now sailing outside Liuhangkou.

<h3>Oriental Culture Society Entertains Two Religious Groups</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Oriental Culture Society, as the Chinese Buddhist Touring Group had arrived in Shanghai and the Japanese Tenrikyo Friendship Association Touring Group had also come to Shanghai for a visit, Huang Jingwan, Hu Boxiang, Zhou Shoujuan, and others invited the two groups to a banquet at the Huibinlou restaurant.

The Buddhist Touring Group included Preacher Sanbin Shanichi, Foreign Language School Professor Ogiyama Sadaichi, and over twenty students. Speaking at the banquet, Bei Guan gave a speech saying that he was very grateful for the hospitality of the Oriental Society and was especially happy to meet the Japanese Tenrikyo members. He hoped there would be opportunities, which would be rare. He recalled that when he studied at a Buddhist academy in Japan thirteen years ago, he often saw the enthusiasm of Japanese Buddhist organizations and monks for Buddhism and social undertakings, which he greatly admired. He returned to China due to illness and lacked the opportunity to go to Japan again, which he deeply regretted. He is now going to travel to various Buddhist countries in Southeast Asia. He explained the purpose and plan of the tour in the declaration. However, the only starting point for us is to see that Chinese Buddhism feels that it has fallen into extinction. People of new thoughts and new movements in the past are now mostly corrupted, which is very painful. Therefore, he contacted Shangren Tisan in Beijing and a group of young comrades to set this path of travel. He privately hopes that in the future, he will have a thorough understanding of the entire beautiful Buddhist culture and true spirit of the East and contribute to Chinese Buddhism and society, promote the revolutionary Buddhism of the Chinese era, and work harder to realize the great unity of mankind. Sanbin Shanichi translated the speech. Next, Mr. Ogiyama Sadaichi gave a fluent speech in Pekingese, saying that every time the members came to China for sightseeing, they gained a lot of knowledge. It is an honor to meet Mr. Huang Jingwan and the monks of the Buddhist Touring Group in Shanghai. The Buddhist Touring Group is making an organized and planned tour, opening a new era in the history of Buddhism in China, which we deeply admire. Traveling to Southeast Asia is a tropical journey, and the monks should take care of themselves along the way and wish them peace. He also said that although we are from Tenrikyo, there are no international or racial differences in our common views on religion, and we hope to be loving and sincere to each other. Finally, Mr. Huang gave a speech. A vegetarian dish was set up separately to entertain Shangren Tisan and Bei Guan for ten minutes. Mr. Huang asked Mr. Ogiyama to take a photo as a souvenir. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>

The director questioned him about his origins. He claimed that his name was Lu Binghong, 11 years old, from Ningbo, and that he lived in his hometown. Because both of his biological parents had passed away one after another, he only depended on his stepmother for life, but she was extremely violent and often beat him. Last month, when his stepmother went to the street to buy vegetables, he took the opportunity to go out to play, not expecting a thief to sneak into the house and steal a suitcase. After his stepmother returned home and noticed, she was furious and immediately beat him and drove him out of the house, not allowing him to enter. Afterwards, a certain family, thinking that he was young and suffering, took him in. After a week, they ordered him to take a teapot out to make tea. He accidentally dropped the porcelain teapot on the ground and broke it, so he could not be tolerated again and was expelled again. Then, he met a person who asked him to go buy pancakes to eat, but he was taken to Shanghai, and the person suddenly disappeared. He had no choice but to wander around, etc. He was ordered to prepare a document to send to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrange for him.</p>

His younger brother, Jingfu, also pulls a cart for a living and lives with him. Their fraternal bond is quite strong. Recently, Jingbang, lacking rice for cooking, borrowed a dime from his neighbor, Mrs. Lang Hua, to avoid hunger. However, Mrs. Lang's husband found out and, believing Ding should not have borrowed money from his wife, went to demand repayment. Ding, penniless, replied that he would repay it in a few days. However, Lang became unreasonably stubborn and insisted on immediate repayment. A disagreement led to a physical fight. Unexpectedly, Lang grabbed a kitchen knife and split Ding's skull open. Blood gushed out like a fountain, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Seeing that he had caused the disaster, Lang fled without a trace. Soon after, Jingfu arrived, helped his brother up, and took him to the hospital for treatment. He also took Mrs. Lang Hua and her son, Xiao Gouzi, to the Fourth District General Office to investigate the matter. The director interrogated them separately and then sent them to the bureau for processing.</p>
<h3>Girl Drowns While Swimming, One Life Lost</h3>
<p>Around 5 o'clock the day before yesterday, a small boat belonging to a Jiangbei resident surnamed Jiang was moored by the Suzhou River at the Wu Family Residence west of Xiaowanliutang, Caojiadu, Shanghai West. Jiang had a daughter named Xier, who was only seven years old. Due to the hot weather, she was playing with three or four children from neighboring boats for a while. They all went into the river together to swim and bathe. Unexpectedly, none of the four children knew how to swim. One of them cried out for help. People from various boats heard the cries, jumped into the water to rescue them, and managed to pull three children out of the water. However, they searched everywhere for the girl but couldn't find her. After many people jumped in and searched for about twenty minutes, they finally found her floating. She had already died. They immediately pulled her out and placed her on a wooden raft by the river. Her family reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station. Yesterday, the local guarantor, Tan Hefu, reported it to the local court, requesting them to send someone to the scene for an inspection.</p>

<h3>Abducted Girl Found in Xinlonghua</h3>
<p>Around 7 o'clock yesterday morning, a girl about thirteen or fourteen years old was seen wandering at the Xinlonghua Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The railway police noticed her suspicious behavior, suspecting that she had been abducted to Shanghai. They questioned her, and she said her name was Zhao Gensheng, fourteen years old, from Shaoxing. Her parents had died early, and she now lived in Hangzhou with her maternal uncle, Zhang Heshang, who worked as a plasterer. A woman, whose name was unknown, tricked her into going out to play in Hangzhou the day before yesterday and took her to Shanghai on a fourth-class train. They had already spent one night in the open on the street. Because she refused to go with her this morning, the woman twisted her ear, and she cried. An unknown old man saw her crying and asked what had happened. At that time, the woman ran away. So, she walked to the station, wanting to return to Hangzhou. The railway police took the girl, Zhao Gensheng, to the Nanzhan Police Station. The Lou Police Station sent police to Hangzhou to find her maternal uncle to come to Shanghai to vouch for and claim her.</p>
<h3>Further Arrests in the Fake Woolen Cloth Scam Using a Fictitious Business Name</h3>
<p>Postponed for Joint Trial</p>
<p>Wu Sien from Shaoxing, colluding with accomplices, falsely established the Hengde business name in Nianxiangfen Lane and defrauded the Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Bailinan Road of 210 chi of fake woolen cloth worth $4,380. He was arrested and detained for questioning. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the defrauded goods were divided, pawned, and sold by Wu and his accomplices. A man named Xie, who is at large, received 19 chi and sold it to Chen Baipeng, a salesman at the Yongfengxiang Foreign Goods Store, for $396. The day before yesterday, Detective Wang Yongjun arrested Chen and learned that the stolen goods were stored at the Baoyu Silk Shop at No. 420 Jiujiang Road, owned by Jin Shaoping. The detective then went to retrieve the original stolen goods, and Jin was also taken into custody. They were then jointly handed over to the Special District Court. Judge Sun conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer stated that Xie Baoyun, the manager of Hengde, had also gone along when Wu and others defrauded the goods, falsely using the name Jin Lanzhang. Jin and others have now been summoned for questioning. Chen Baipeng confessed that he was friends with Xie. Because Xie owed him money, Xie used the 19 chi of woolen cloth as collateral, and he then sent it to Jin's place, asking Jin Shaoping to sell it for him. Jin Shaoping admitted that Chen had stored the woolen cloth at his place. Judge Sun ordered Chen Baipeng and Jin Shaoping to each provide a guarantor for $1,000. Jin Lanzhang, Shen Tingsheng, Chen Zhiliang, Tao Kunzai, and others all provided guarantees to be available when summoned. The case was postponed to the 22nd of this month and will be jointly tried with Wu Sien.</p>
<h3>Repeated Thefts at Jinsan Foreign Firm</h3>
<p>Perpetrated by Shop Assistant Chen Hongnian, Exposed Due to Lavish Clothing</p>
<p>The cosmetics department of the German Jinsan Foreign Firm at No. 9 Hankou Road has repeatedly reported thefts from January of this year to the present. Various cosmetics, perfumes, powders, scissors, and other items have been lost, especially scissors. The estimated value of the stolen goods is over $4,000. The firm recently reported the matter to the General Police Station, which dispatched Detective Sun Aizhong and a foreign detective to investigate. They suspected Chen Hongnian (also known as Chen Hongde), a Suzhou shop assistant hired by the firm. Chen was brought into the police station and confessed after interrogation. The reason for Chen's exposure this time was his overly lavish clothing. As a shop assistant with a monthly salary of only $25, he had to provide his own food and lodging and support his family. He could barely make ends meet, so how could he have extra money to buy clothes? The detectives therefore paid attention to him. Later, they searched Chen's residence at No. 1362 Datong Road and found several types of cosmetics from the foreign firm, further confirming his theft. He was handed over to Judge Zhou of the Special District Court the day before yesterday for a preliminary hearing. The judge ordered him to remain in custody pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Poverty-Stricken Patient Attempts Suicide and is Rescued</h3>
<p>Fortunately, a Friend Visited, Otherwise a Life Would Have Been Lost</p>
<p>Shi Dagouzi, a resident of a shack in Hujiamuqiao (i.e., Wuhua Road) in northern Shanghai, used to work as a laborer in a flour mill. His wife, Zhou, works at a nearby silk floss (also known as scrap silk) factory. They have three young children who are still being raised. Dagouzi has been ill at home and unable to work, and the family is often without food. Dagouzi decided to give his six-year-old son away to ease the burden, but his wife, Zhou, disagreed, and they argued. Dagouzi suffers from debilitating tuberculosis and cannot recover quickly, and he has no money for treatment, so he has to resign himself to fate. Lately, he has become increasingly destitute and resentful, and he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. Yesterday afternoon, while his wife was at work, he hanged himself with a belt from the beam of the thatched house. However, a friend named Li happened to be looking for Shi Dagouzi and was led into the house by Dagouzi's eldest son. He was shocked to see Dagouzi hanging from the beam and shouted for help. Neighbors gathered and rescued Dagouzi. Fortunately, the house was low, and he had not yet died. They immediately performed artificial respiration and fed him soup, and he regained consciousness. When his wife, Zhou, returned home from work, she learned that her husband had attempted suicide out of resentment and had been rescued by the neighbors. She thanked them profusely.</p>

A police officer on board spotted him and immediately grabbed his sleeve, preventing a tragedy. When asked why he was trying to commit suicide and for his name and address, he did not say a word and only wept. The train was stopped, and the young man was handed over to the police in the Fifth District for questioning.</p>

<h3>Era Youth, Issue 2</h3>
<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>Currently, the entire youth community in China seems to have only two paths: degeneration and corruption. The degenerated take risks and do not cherish their lives, not knowing the precious golden years of youth. They do not seek proper outlets or plan for positive and upward development. All that they imagine, hope for, come into contact with, and that revolves in their minds and fills their entire souls is nothing but hunger, poverty, burning, killing, destruction, overthrow, opposition, etc. The corrupted can be divided into several factions: decadent, depraved, pessimistic, passive, world-weary, romantic, and also a kind of bewildered. These two factual phenomena have almost become the century's disease of Chinese youth. Those who can truly transcend these two huge diseases and embark on the journey of the true meaning of life are rare.</p>
<p>The reason why youth have formed this morbid state can be briefly summarized as internal dissatisfaction with reality and external influence by various and diverse ideologies. Over time, they unconsciously go astray. Youth are both the vitality of the nation and the sustenance of national life. The prosperity or decline of a nation depends entirely on the situation of the entire youth community. The mission that youth bear is so important. Now, in China, the phenomenon of the youth community is nothing more than the two situations mentioned above. If we ask whether these two deformed youths can shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the country, how can the country prosper and how can the nation flourish? If this continues to evolve, the Chinese nation can only sit and wait for its demise.</p>
<p>If we want to break through this huge crisis, we must actively plan for relief. The first method of relief should start with correcting all the past wrong ideas and concepts, striving to point out all the past mistakes like a mirror, and ruthlessly exposing all the wrong insides. It is best to criticize them so thoroughly that those harmful ideas that act as ghosts and goblins have nowhere to hide. At the same time, we must also point out a bright path, a journey of the true meaning of life, so that young people have something to follow. In other words, we must determine a central idea. This central idea, needless to say, is to fight for the nation.</p>
<p>Era Youth is the expression of shouldering this mission. Its inaugural issue was published last Wednesday, and I have already introduced it. Its second issue will meet us again this Wednesday. I love to read this publication and want to share my love with the public. It is truly a publication that young people must read. Furthermore, because the publication is just starting, I am afraid that young people do not fully know about it, so I am happy to introduce it for the second time.</p>
<p>The content of the second issue includes Tang Zenghui's "Anatomy of the Morbid State of Modern Chinese Youth," Tie Seng's "A Bird's-Eye View of the Anti-Imperialist Movement of Weak Nations" and "The Way Out for the Chinese Nation to Seek Freedom and Equality," and Xu Zexiang's "Striving for National Glory." The first two articles are continued from the previous issue and are both extensive articles. In "Anatomy of the Morbid State of Modern Chinese Youth," Tang Jun's analysis is truly detailed and thorough. He has a far-reaching vision and profound exploration. He finds the roots of the morbid state of Chinese youth from the world's trends and China's environment. He divides the entire youth community into four major factions: decadent, romantic, bewildered, and radical. He then further dissects these four factions in detail, which is truly thorough. All the morbid states of Chinese youth are mostly within these four categories. If it is allowed to simply continue, the danger to the youth themselves is needless to say, and there will be great obstacles to society and the country. Therefore, it is urgent and cannot be delayed that we must try to cure these bad diseases. This article has not yet been finished, so let us wait and see what the next issue brings.</p>
<p>In "A Bird's-Eye View of the Anti-Imperialist Movement of Weak Nations" and "The Way Out for the Chinese Nation to Seek Freedom and Equality," Tie Seng truly deserves to be a bird. A bird's vision is sharp and insightful and can surpass others. Now, I will only make a considerable introduction to the two conclusions of this article:</p>
<p>The Chinese nation's path to liberation must never again take the wrong path of gently seeking liberation from imperialists. If our nation wants a way out, it can only rise up and fight the imperialists in close combat and vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy to abolish all unequal treaties, with Turkey as a good example of the Chinese national revolution. Secondly, the urgent task at hand is to have a considerable organization for weak nations in the international community. Furthermore, we must overthrow the foundation of their economic aggression.</p>
<p>I have written a few sentences very hastily. Please let the readers explore the rest for themselves.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (190)</h3>
<p>— Written by John Macy of the United States, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 40: The Poetry of America</p>
<p>The friends of those gentlemen in Cambridge, Concord, and Boston have more fire burning in their breasts, it seems, than can be seen or heard. That poet, the mild Quaker hiding in his breast, is Whittier. Perhaps since the English poet Crabbe, there has never been a poet so unpoetic who has embarked on that difficult art. Like Crabbe, Whittier has a vivid feeling for life and the scenes he lives in. His religious poems, as religious poems often are, are flat. His ballads are often bad literature. Sometimes, as in "Skipper Ireson's Ride," there is also a ballad tone. His near-masterpiece is a true depiction of the coldness, loneliness, and snowy scenes of old New England winters. It is truly, coarsely, and wonderfully expressed. Whittier is eager to be a poet and has the urge to express himself. However, as he says in one of his true poems about himself, he suffers from the harshness of untrained ears.</p>
<p>As the older people get old and famous (and Poe died at a relatively young age), a great poet of about the same age as the acknowledged veterans is gradually discovered and appreciated. Walt Whitman is called the "good gray poet" because he was indeed gray in the latter half of his life. However, "Leaves of Grass" is the youngest, boldest, and most challenging book of poetry published in America. It is a wonderful mixture of immaturity and beauty. In the majestic sentences, the continuity of the sentences is filled with the most inferior force. The worst sentences are as clumsy as anything the poet has ever written. However, even those sentences are compensated for by the consistency and combination of the entire volume. Why? Because "Leaves of Grass" is a complete book, a poetic life of a person over many years. Whitman sings the praises of democracy. He sings of himself as an interesting person. In fact, he is an interesting person. In the middle of his life, he sings of Abraham Lincoln in noble poetry. There is a preordained relationship between Lincoln and Whitman. Lowell called Mark Twain the Lincoln of American literature. He made an appropriate association. Why? Because Lincoln would not understand Whitman as a poet. Lincoln's poetic consciousness is far below his own instinctive or developed prose poetic consciousness. However, the halo that shines around Lincoln's head also shows the radiant beauty of the wreath that Whitman placed on that troubled brow. Whitman has become Lincoln's poet laureate in a way that is increasingly perceived because of this. "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" is undoubtedly a high marker of American poetry, and there are extraordinary moments in all of Whitman's moods. He wrote a lot of worthless things, and so did Witter Bynner and other poets. At that highest point, Whitman is the pure poet of the sea, the sun, the trampling earth, and the millions of people. Whitman imagined that he had created a new poetic form and abandoned the shackles of inherited rhythm and sentence structure. However, what makes him great is not his formal originality or eccentricity. His beauty lies in the essential rhythm as old as English poetry, and his originality is only that he is a great poet, a new and original poet at his best. Leaving the latter is always the best place for the poet.</p>
<p>After Whitman, American poetry mostly gradually declined. However, even the best anthologies of poetry must publish some poems like the following. That is, the poems of Emily Dickinson, although concise to the point of strangeness and expressing only half the time, express ten points in that style. Although she does not stop being an American, she reminds people of the Irish and is therefore also the delicate goblin poetry of Louis Guiney, a poet. The simple poetry of James Whitcomb Riley has a luxurious beauty. The poetry of Thomas Bailey Aldrich still has the poetry of Sidney Lanier, a poet with great hopes far beyond the unhealthiness and countless difficulties that allow the muse to realize him. Even among great poets, it is difficult to find anything more dazzling and gorgeous than Lanier's "The Marshes of Glynn" and "Sunrise." American poets are often weak, lacking expressiveness, and unclear in voice. However, the lyre of Orpheus has not yet lost its strings, and if America is not a land of song, then it can be said that there are pure and beautiful tunes there from time to time.

<h3>Jewish Drama</h3>
<p>— Yang Changxi</p>
<p>The awakening of national consciousness expressed by black people in literature has been briefly discussed, but the Jewish people, who have suffered the same fate as the Negro people, also exist. Their wandering period is longer than that of the Negro people, and their distribution area is wider than that of black people. Moreover, many talented inventors and political pioneers in various countries in the world are cultivated by Jewish blood. Foreigners (the most obvious examples can be found in the scientific and political fields of Germany and Russia). Therefore, in their long history, their position in literature, especially in Russian and American literature, occupies a very important position.</p>
<p>In Russian literature, Jews not only occupied a very important position in the past, but also have their unique position in modern New Russia. However, the characteristics of the Jewish nation are most profoundly presented in drama. Therefore, we must examine how the Jewish nation injected their blood into the drama in the new Russian drama, how to permeate the material about Jews into the organization of the drama, and we must specifically unfold a page in the history of new Russian drama to study the Jewish Kamerny Theatre and Habama.</p>
<p>The Jewish Kamerny Theatre began to be established in Leningrad in 1918 because at that time A. M. Granoski returned from the West. He worked with the German director Reinhardt of the same name in Germany and became familiar with the theaters of Western Europe. Therefore, he began to establish the Jewish Theatrical Studio. After six full months of painstaking training, the scripts of new Jewish dramatists such as Sholom Ash and Belgian Maeterlinck were staged according to European training. In 1920, it moved to Moscow because many Jews lived there, and because their dramas and theaters were wonderful, this young group gained deep sympathy and more clearly turned to scripts based on Jewish material. Later, due to economic growth and the Jewish actors' tempering of art, they moved to a vast place. The artistic training is because Jews have a natural characteristic of regarding art as a kind of religious expression and admiration. Therefore, before an actor becomes a skilled expression of mastering his psychology and emotions in various characters, he must undergo a long period of hard training. Under the leadership of Granoski, in addition to staging some Russian and other foreign dramas, special attention is paid to dramas that can express the Jewish spirit. Therefore, in the labor, peasant, or art theaters that are widely established in all of Russia,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>they can open up a unique flower for the Jewish nation, and it is also a fruitful result of the ethnic groups in the entire Russian Federation. Recently, they went to Berlin, Germany, for a period of itinerant performances. In addition to receiving enthusiastic praise from the Germans, especially the Jewish audience expressed very close affection for them.</p>
<p>The Habama troupe is also a brother of this theater. This troupe is considered one of the most artistically valuable contributors in Germany. The internal actors are all residents from Jewish Palestine. Under the training of Atanov, a disciple of the naturalist director Stanislavski, they combined the norms of the Russian stage with the rigor of the Palestinian Jews. This kind of extremely unique artistic life and deep solemnity, which grew out of two ancient national characteristics, became a unique art after the Russian Revolution. Like the Jewish Kamerny Theatre, they only aroused their spirit during training and performed with a religious, sacred and pious perfection. Their method is different from European theaters. Their research on the script is meticulous, the rehearsal is rigorous, the director is a diligent researcher of his plan, and the painter carefully wields his brush. Costumes, arrangements, movements, music, etc. are not carelessly omitted and not simplified due to economic difficulties. They work hard outside the group to maintain this group when they are in economic difficulties. Therefore, they isolate the world with the solemnity of the Jews and live independently in their world.</p>
<p>Because these two Jewish ethnic drama groups naturally reached the script itself and the estimation of artistic value of other theaters, the Russian people demanded that drama pay attention to art in addition to propaganda, all of which felt the stimulation given to them by the Jewish nation.</p>
<p>At the same time, Jews are also worthy of attention in American literature. Although they are poor and mostly live in the East Side specially set up for Jews in New York, working hard and living a life of prostitution, there are also outstanding world-shaking labor writers and playwrights like Micbe Gold in literature. The most vivid expression of the vitality of Jews in drama and their national spirit is the Jewish Workers' Theatre directed by Gold. Although their gifts to American literature are not as obvious as those of black people, their status is not inferior to that of black people. It's just that they do not have national self-consciousness and will always become a backward nation in the cultivation of Hebrew religion.</p>
<h3>Plan for a Hundred-Story Giant Building in New York</h3>
<p>The Woolworlh Jower, the tallest building in New York, USA, has already broken the world's new record. Even now, no other country can match its height. However, its position as a fifty-story high-rise building 792 feet above the ground will soon be taken by the Charyslei Building in the center of New York City, which is 808 feet above the ground with 67 floors. Similar to these 67 floors, there are also plans for the Empire State Building with 87 floors 1,062 feet above the ground and the Metiopoliton life Insurance Company's hundred-story building plan. The citizen insurance company is thirty-two floors higher than the eighty-seven-story building, and it also strives to study the foundation to be able to handle the cornerstone of the hundred-story high-rise variable weight. In addition to minerals and glass, other internal devices of the company are not suitable for use. In total, the company's future manpower will increase from 12,000 to 30,000. Its scale and business operations will be the crown of the world. (Yi Kang)</p>
