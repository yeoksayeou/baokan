<h3 id="c17">埃及亂事 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>埃及自獨立告成而後。其國人一致注意之最大目標。即爲欲求逹完全獨立之目的。所謂英埃談判者。已一試再試。近又告一次失敗矣。世人方以埃及外交上之糾紛爲可慮。而不謂今又發生内爭之風潮也。</p>
<p>此次内爭之風潮。爲擁護憲法而起。前内閣那哈斯。因埃王拒絶其保障憲法之提案而辭職。錫基新閣成立後。國會即表示擁護那哈斯憲法之主張。並起而作反政府之運動。於是埃王下令停止國會開會。國民黨議員。謀自召集特别會議。復遭政府禁阻。國人乃益憤慨。合國民黨與前首相那哈斯一派及靑年羣衆之力。以倒政府。故其風潮愈見擴大矣。此次埃及亂事。旣爲爭憲法而起固與對外無關。然一旦風潮擴大而後。亦難保不有意外問題發生。因之英國對於埃亂。甚爲注意。外相外務次官等。於下院屢有報告。討論所以應付方法首相麥唐納。雖聲明始終抱嚴格中立態度。不加干涉。但亦以不碍及英人之安全爲限。故今日雖云尙未有出兵必要。然調遣軍艦於波賽蘇彝士河及亞歷山大利亞等處。嚴密防範。已甚忙碌。假使埃及之内亂。不能遽已。則非特政府之摇動爲可危。而響影或將及於久議未决之英埃談判問題。所謂因内辭而牽動外交。尤可爲埃及前途慮也。</p>

<p>（四）一九二九年作品的鳥瞰（下）</p>
<p>在篷娜左面的是三張蓋朗CharlesGuerin的畫。他的顔色後之塞尙似乎更進足色調之美了。他雖然是有承繼塞尙的意味。更想使寫實徹底到極頂的。最近他是用熱情的眼光去寫現代婦人的肖像。却能夠巧妙地畫出現代婦人的心底的其旁邊是歐司班牙Eespagnat的一張大裸體畫。一張靜物畫。這兩位作家的畫像競爭地相並卦着。大概是因爲他倆都是有特殊性格的色彩家。所以把他們的作品並有一塊。歐司班牙是從羅諾阿Ｒenior的畫風漸進地移入更摇動的筆觸。誇張着奇拔之感。在其對面是拉丕拉特PirreLaprade的二張靜物畫。厚疊着强烈的色彩。宛如彩畫玻璃的花紋一般。粗粗地作高低之感的畫風。在其左面的。是巴黎時髦的作家阿司朗的Asselin「人體」。畫著的是中間坐一個裸體婦女。旁邊一個孩子。前面一塊布。又其左邊是法伏利Favry的「浴」這實在是許多畫中最可注目的一點。再過去是伽洛PerKrobg的畫。這三個人從不同的三方面。各替法蘭西新興藝術又開了一個端緒在現代巴黎藝壇他們是佔有同等的地位的。法伏利很强烈的注重自我的感情。阿思朗承繼着塞當要從空間捕捉常住的自然實相。伽洛便從原始方面希圖在全野蠻的風味中去發現新生命。美術如果只是自然外形忠實的模寫。那綱膜便完全是種攝影機。手也只是種機械。作品也不過和照片一様。法伏利是用對象做媒介實現自我阿思朗用色彩。形狀堅實到底。結構起來做内面自我的發表本來美術之所以爲美術的本質不在模寫的對象。却在能創造的自我内在性。所以愈是純粹的藝術便愈能直接表出這様内在的精神。</p>
<p>回講我們的參觀情形罷。哦。好大的幾幅畫。畫的都是耶穌上十字架的慘狀。那是用現代的手法而拿宗敎爲題材的畫。這一帶長廓。兩面壁上都是這類的畫。我感覺到的耶穌或是像「夜叉」那様可怖。或是像「無常」那般慘白。也有黑漆一圑。是一片墨晶似的臉面。濃重而凌亂的色感。眞是不可解哩。啊啊。那裏是Demenusse是MargneriteCrisay的畫。他們很注重崇高的意味。以傳出美的快感。還有迦孟Camorn畫的「港口」。他是善用鮮麗的彩色表白强烈振動的一種技術。再進去一室是卦着立體派的畫。一片大紅象火炎。一塊烏黑像墨炭。碧藍的斜紋。鵝黃的底色。充滿着更大的魅力會漸漸地剌戟我們的心。嗡這是立體派有名的大人物勃拉克GcorgosBraque的大作。他使物體還元。獨立而圖型化。描着樂器的靜物畫在激動之中含有一種奇拔的表現法。純由藝術家的想像去創造。和自然的實際全没有什麽關係。一直走過去。就看見克司林Kiscling的「肖像畫」和一盆「花」這便是現時代表北歐的最特殊的作品。他是和瑪提斯的畫相隔甚遠。和畢克拔PabloPieasso勃拉克的主骨體派也絶對不同的。是在嚴肅之中含有一種剌激的神奇。秋季沙龍的外國人。算他獨一無二了。這是洛蒂宏Lotiron。這是佛利士Friez。這是阿祁拿伊Hagninoya。這是西蒙Simon都是有名的藝術家。我實在應不暇接了。我只好隨手舉出幾位。若論起這次的各國出品的名家。眞如車載斗量。以後隨時再談罷。</p>
<p>在下層。幾十間壯麗奇拔的新式木器。還有許多工藝美術。但我們對於它是外行而又没甚興味。所以就草草走過了。噯。在南北兩廓的許多彫塑。我們雖然十分愛好。但是也没有能力挿嘴的。我們這是第一次游了半天。一到五月一日是開幕的正日。那眞正人山人海。實在無法駐足。以後我是彷彿一星期終是要去一次的。毎去一次。常覺低回留之。不能去焉。</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3 id="c191">社會學刋第二期　楊·企·雲· <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>東南社會學會編輯</p>
<p>世界書局發行</p>
<p>第二期社會學刋共有九篇論著、（一）社會動作的兩個分類、（二）社會學與經濟學、（三）農村社會調查的研究、（四）社會學體系論、（五）論社會學的内容並答彭基相君（六）中國之勞工立法、（七）文化與優生學、（八（優生與文化、（九）再論文化與優生學、茲摘要介紹於下、</p>
<p>社會動作的兩個分類</p>
<p>社會本來已經是個夠複雜的東西、在這個夠複雜的東西中、更要研究它的動作、自然不得不詳細地分析出門類去研究了、此篇作者許仕廉、他以客觀的、僱重於社會性質的、擬定一個動作的分類、示學者研究社會動作的途徑、同時他把美國海夷史（Hayes）敎授的主觀的分析、介紹於後、這是一個偏重於個人心理的社會動作分類、</p>
<p>以社會學的態度來說、無論何種的分類、都祗有相當的好歹、不過主觀的、偏於内在的、總會犯着較多的毛病、所以本文作者「不認民理分析爲完善」、因心理分析中没有圑體自存及圑體永存的動作、</p>
<p>自然本文所値得注意的、也就在作者的客觀分析不段、有其獨到之見、</p>
<p>社會學與經濟學</p>
<p>作者爲我國有數的社會經濟學家、尤長於經濟思想的研究、這在本期編輯贅言中、就這様地告訴了我們、所以本文作者處處露出經濟學者本來的面目、他肯定的說、經濟學是一門獨立的科學、經濟學並不是社會學的一部分、</p>
<p>全文分四層論述、（一）社會學係經濟學一部份乎抑經濟學爲社會學之一部份乎、（二）社會學與經濟學相同之點、（三）研究經濟學應研究何種社會學科目、（四）研究社會學者應研究何種經濟學科目、</p>
<p>關於第一點、作者開頭就這様的說、「社會學及經濟學、均爲獨立的科學、二科各自有其致力之點、而各不相妨、」從這句斷語中、引伸出許多證明、詳釋從前一般學者的錯誤底論調、並言經濟學之所以成爲科學的理由、他說經濟學是研究人與人財、富上之關係、僅從社會科學、中、提出其有關經濟方面之事實與學理使其成爲一種科學而已、第二部份中是說、「社會學與經濟學相同之點」作者告訴我們有三點、（一）社會學與經濟學有一最大相似之點、即二者俱爲研究人與人的關係之科學、（二）就方法一方面言之、二科所用者相同、演繹與歸納二法、殆缺一不可也、（三）社會學與經濟學二科、與他種科學之關係、皆甚密切、換言之、以其内容性質之相近、大抵對於社會學者極重要之科學、對於經濟學者、亦有同等之重要、此外、本文的末了兩層、亦可說本文有價値的所在、示學子研究的途徑、爲選科的一助、</p>
<p>農村社會調查的研究</p>
<p>中國向來對於一切的事實、從來没有看到過有系統的調查和眞確的統計的、晚近研究到許多社會問題的時候、往往祇可拿外國調查研究的材料、來證明中國某種社會問題的證據、這不是削木就履、牽强附會兼而有之的大笑話嗎、本文作者感覺到這點、他說「中國對於社會調查方面、尤其是對於農村社會方面、向來就缺少有系統有條理的研究、除了文人學士的幾首詩、諸子百家的幾篇剳記、或有時叙述當時的社會情形外、竟無一種所謂社會的調查、現在雖有些零碎的文章、可是眞確而合乎調查原理的、仍是很少、」同時我們知道我們中國是農業國、我們要改良農村、振興農業物、我們自然就得先知道應當改革是什麽、應當提倡的什麽、那麽、也自然不得不先從調查着手了、</p>
<p>本文著重討論的是農村社會調查的方法、作者用科學的方法、依據農村社會現象、定下調查的手續和方法、同時又把農村社會調查的類别、分析出一個精密的綱要、而且末了還附下十四種調查農村社會的表格、都是按照中國的農村社會狀况而擬草的、可說是一篇很有價値的作品、</p>
<p>社會學體系論</p>
<p>社會學者對于社會學說、向來没有一致的見解、自然也就弄得各有各的體系、本文作者、他先把一般的分類叙述了一下、有沃德（Word）、遠藤隆吉的、新明正道的、以及其他的社會學體系的分類、最後的一部份、他把「我們的社會學體系的分顃」寫了出來、作者以爲孔德以德的近世社會學史上的社會學乾的努力、主要的有兩個社會學體系、即就是（一）綜合的社會學體系、和（二）特殊社會科學的社會學體系、</p>
<p>全文可說都是介紹的性質、編輯贅言中所謂「收羅甚富、見解尤當」、第一點我自然也是承認的、可是第二句「見解尤當」一語、適和我的觀察相反、我覺得本文似乎缺少些見解、没有把各「體系的分類」底得失、加以說明、</p>
<p>中國之勞工立法</p>
<p>我國的工業、雖很幼稚、但我國的勞資糾紛、在大都市中、已夠可觀了、我們要勞資糾紛的减少、工作效率的增加、自然我們就需要完備的勞工法了、本文作者祝君把中國歷來所有的勞工法規、都搜羅了來、作有系統的分析和批判、於民國十七年工商部、所擬之工廠法草案中、關于盈餘分配一節、很引人注意、甚至中國經濟學社特在南京中央大學、舉行研究會討論之、而作者的意見、以爲「按此種懸題、與中國之工業、相關至切、非從理論事實兩方、詳細研究、不能草率頒布、因中國之工業、受帝國主義之摧殘、無日不在風雨飄摇之中、對于工業之發展、應盡最提倡、俾失業工人、得尋覓工作」、</p>
<p>本文最後的一部份、尤爲作者見解得當之處、他說編撰勞動法之要點有二、即）一（編撰勞動法、須辯别學理的基礎、作者以爲我國的勞動法、「應注意生産之增加、提倡勞資之合作、簡言之、孫總理之民生主義、應爲勞働法學理之基礎、」、（二）編撰勞働法、須先調查社會之現狀、閉門造車、自然是不會得適用的、作者告訴我們說、「法律爲醫治社會病症之一種方案、學理僅說明配藥之方法、故臨症實施、非詳察病狀、不能着手」、上述兩點、是很値得立法者的注意的、</p>
<p>「文化與優生」的問題</p>
<p>關于這個問題、本期社會學刋上有三篇文字、第一篇是孫本文的「文化與優生學」、原來在社會科學雜誌第一卷第三期上發表過的、因爲引起潘光旦的辯論、所以又重載於此、從孫先生先寫了那篇「文化與優生學」後、就引起潘先生的辯論、寫了一篇「優生與文化」、接着孫先生要覆辯、所以又寫了一篇「再論文化與優生學」、</p>
<p>我們曉得潘先生是優生學家、孫先生是文化社會學者、他是很反對所謂「心理遺傳」的說數的、自然、他倆在學術見解上、就站在絶對相反的地位、這様一來、如編者所言「希望文化與優生的問題、得以愈辯愈明、」兩者純從學術的立塲上來辯論、各有充分的根據、互相批評、互相責難、我們自然承認、｜尤其是在我國學術幼稚的時代、這種學術上迷信的態度、是有相當的價値的、但因根本社會學是個最遲産生的科學、至於優生學與文化社會學尙在萌芽的時期、我們也很難說誰的是、誰的不是了、總之、各是各的忠實信仰者、各人所說的、都可代表各該派的學理、也竭力主張各該派的學理是對的、是科學的、自然很値得我們來共同探討、於此更希望能有第三者以客觀的態度、對本問題發表有力的學理、</p>

<h3 id="c194">世界文學的故事（一八四） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>美國約𦒋瑪西著胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第四十八章　亞美利加的論文和歷史</p>
<p>許許多多極壯麗的作家是著名於文學的不止一種的部門的、由此看來、將文學者分類爲論文家·詩人·小說家等等、就有些牽强而不合人類精神了、說句簡短的話、我們更詳細地作爲詩人及故事家考慮的坡乃是屬於第一流的論文家將這一層想起來就是、對於將坡的有些論文及「隨筆」看作他那異常的天才的最有光輝的瞬間的讀者、我是不想和他爭論什麽的、</p>
<p>坡的短促而磳磴的生涯由作爲新聞記者的名聲和他那實際美好的成績部分底地被認識的事、略被温暖於陽光似的、愛默生則作爲一種非正式的牧師而遵循他的明朗的道路、莎羅則大抵單獨生活、以鉛筆爲自已的生活、在他的論文中時時觸到公衆問題、却决不實際參加那問題、無論那所享樂的是什麽、總之享樂了世間更加光輝的生涯的紐英格蘭的論文家有兩人、即羅厄爾及和謨茲、</p>
<p>和謨茲是醫師、是哈佛醫學校的解剖學敎授、是在比康街建了邸宅的波士頓的貴族、他知道以機才流暢地作輕快詩的方術、然而神們並不想望使他成爲詩人、神們使他成了論文家、成了極優美的論文家、具有愉快的慢步的調子和多種多様變化無窮的主材的「在早餐桌的獨裁家、」在現今也和六十餘年前發表於「大西洋月刋」時一様地淸新、是給和謨茲以得與蒙旦及拉穆並列的資格的、正如羅厄爾巧妙地評過他似的、他禀賦了「名聲的偉大的防腐劑、即文體、」</p>
<p>而且羅厄爾本人有着較之在詩這方面他那纎細的才能、於我的耳遠更確實地作響的散文的天禀、羅厄爾是養育得好好的世人、是哈佛大學的文學敎授、却决非衒學者、是從合衆國派往英吉利的公使、而當時頗有勢力的人物、他的興味的範圍廣汛、他的綽塞論是再好也没有的、而且當世間對於伊里諾斯州的那不可思議的人物還懷着欵惑、而保守底政治家給了後來判明是過慮的那忠告時、羅厄爾就理解了林肯、而以决定底智慧「估量了他的價値、」關於在我以爲還有着活力的他的詩的唯一的部分、我不久要來說一下的、在這裏、只一提及極諧謔底、極揚基風的論文「見於外國人的或一種謙讓」就算了罷、</p>
<p>是歷史的製造家、或是歷史的著者、而知道了自已表現的方法的人、亞美利加是極富於他們的、具有演說或文章的天禀的歷史的製造家是佛蘭克林·哲斐孫·韋白斯特·林肯等等、别的讀者會立　加添什麽上去的我的選擇｜倘若我們能夠將人類思想的一部門從别的部門分離｜是並不由政治底歷史上的判斷、却由純然的文學底標準而被决定的、</p>
<p>佛蘭克林的「自叙傳」和他那隨時的文章和信札恐怕不是在文學史上有高的價値的東西、然而那些却以整齊的調子描着正直而諧謔的性格、而且因爲在今日該算是「能率研究家」的實際人物佛蘭克林爲要完成自已的文體研究了阿狄生的「斯配克推透、」因此也不失自已强有力的人格的緣故、還有着特殊的文學底興味、</p>
<p>哲斐孫的國家底文書和書翰有着單單歷史底興味以上的價値、在他那政治底的理論和實際、他是乖張地錯誤呢、還是卓越地正當都未可知、這一層現下於我們不成問題、他在他的性質中有着藝術家的片影、他所起草的「獨立宣言」是明晰而雄辯的措辭的模範、</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Turmoil in Egypt <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since Egypt achieved independence, the greatest goal that its people have unanimously focused on has been to achieve complete independence. The so-called Anglo-Egyptian negotiations have been attempted again and again, and recently, they have failed once again. The world is already concerned about Egypt's diplomatic disputes, but it did not expect internal strife to erupt again now.</p>
<p>This internal strife has arisen in support of the constitution. The previous cabinet, led by Nahas Pasha, resigned because the Egyptian King rejected his proposal to protect the constitution. After the formation of the new cabinet by Sidky Pasha, the parliament expressed its support for Nahas Pasha's constitutional claims and rose up to launch an anti-government movement. Therefore, the Egyptian King ordered the suspension of the parliament's meeting. National Party members planned to convene a special meeting themselves, but were prevented by the government. The people became even more indignant and united the forces of the National Party, the faction of former Prime Minister Nahas Pasha, and the youth masses to overthrow the government. Therefore, the turmoil is increasingly expanding. This Egyptian turmoil arose from the dispute over the constitution and is not related to foreign affairs. However, once the turmoil expands, it is difficult to guarantee that unexpected problems will not occur. Therefore, the United Kingdom is paying close attention to the Egyptian turmoil. The Foreign Secretary and Under-Secretary have repeatedly reported to the House of Commons and discussed how to deal with the situation. Prime Minister MacDonald has stated that he will maintain a strictly neutral attitude and will not interfere, but only to the extent that it does not hinder the safety of British citizens. Therefore, although it is said that there is still no need to send troops, it is very busy dispatching warships to Port Said, the Suez Canal, and Alexandria for strict precautions. If the internal turmoil in Egypt cannot be resolved quickly, it will not only endanger the stability of the government, but the repercussions may also affect the long-discussed and unresolved Anglo-Egyptian negotiation issue. The so-called internal affairs affecting diplomacy is especially worrying for the future of Egypt.</p>

<p>Conservative Party Wins a Landslide Victory</p>
<p>Current Cabinet Prepares to Resign</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 29th: The results of the Canadian general election, except for five districts, have all been announced. The number of seats won by each party is as follows: Conservative Party 226, Liberal Party 85, United Farmers of Alberta 10, Labour Party 3, Progressive Party, Independent Party, and Liberal-Progressive Party 2 each. Prime Minister King has resigned to the Governor-General, stating that the current cabinet will resign as soon as the new government is ready. The election has caused a surge in textile stocks, as it is believed that the new government will increase protective tariffs to counter imports. If so, imports from the United States will be the most severely affected.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Montreal, 29th: According to announcements made today, the Conservative Party was victorious in yesterday's election for members of the Canadian House of Commons, winning a majority of seats. Although the total number of votes counted is not yet complete, it is estimated that the Conservative Party will win at least 132 seats. The number of seats they have won in each region is as follows: Ontario 60 seats, Quebec 25 seats, Maritime provinces 23 seats, British Columbia 6 seats, Manitoba 8 seats, Saskatchewan 3 seats, Alberta 4 seats, Yukon 1 seat.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 29th: A dispatch from Ottawa states that the Conservative Party won a landslide victory in the Canadian general election. The British Conservative newspapers are all elated, seeing it as clear proof of greater support for protectionist tariff policies and hoping that it foreshadows the Conservatives' return to power in the mother country.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Noteworthy Events Amidst the German Election Atmosphere <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Center Party Warns Social Democrats</p>
<p>Employees' Union Protests Layoffs</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 29th: In this German general election, all the election speeches and editorials in party newspapers are not as concerned with many minor issues as in previous years, demonstrating the seriousness of the current political and economic situation and the great importance of this election. Today, there are two more noteworthy events: one is that the leader of the Center Party sent a letter warning the Social Democratic Party that if it does not change its opposition to Chancellor Brüning, the Center Party will not cooperate with the Social Democratic Party in the Prussian state government and parliament. The stability of the German republican system often depends on Prussia, and today the joint cabinet of the Prussian left and central parties holds a narrow majority of seats in parliament compared to the opposition. If the Central Party does not support the Social Democrats, it will likely trigger a political crisis. Therefore, this warning is extremely powerful, and if implemented, it will also be very dangerous. The other is that the German Employees' Union has submitted a letter to the federal government protesting the large-scale layoffs in major factories, asking the government to pay attention to this issue. Because this will not only increase expenditures on unemployment insurance and affect national finances, but also at a time of parliamentary re-election, the sudden increase in unemployment may help to expand the power of extremists on both the left and right wings, which will obstruct the stability of the nation's politics and economy. Therefore, various political parties of the middle class are also quite concerned about this move by major factories.</p>

<p>Designed to Combat Prison Labor Products</p>
<p>Applied Equally to All Countries</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 29th: According to government officials today, the recently drafted plan to boycott products produced by prison labor from entering the United States is not only aimed specifically at Russia, but will also be applied equally to all other countries. Because two merchant ships loaded with wood were recently prevented from entering the port by the Ministry of Finance, there was widespread speculation that this matter was specifically aimed at Soviet Russia. The above-mentioned remarks by officials were specifically issued to explain this matter. According to official sources, the authorities consider trade with Soviet Russia to be very important, and if they implement a boycott against Soviet Russia, they will lose a major buyer.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: Local towns and villages, citing the plummeting prices of agricultural products and the worsening rural economy, have successively seen the emergence of leagues for arrears in tax payments, postponement of repayments of local bonds, and movements not to repay loans. In view of this, Minister of Home Affairs Adachi summoned Director of the Local Bureau Tsugita and Director of the Police Bureau Otsuka to his official residence last night. As a result of the discussion, the following policy was decided: First, the publication of such books and pamphlets that instigate movements to default on taxes out of impure motives, which clearly show contempt for the people's obligation to pay taxes and disrupt public order, should be prohibited, and the instigators and instigators of the movement should be severely punished. The government expresses full sympathy for the suffering caused by the economic downturn, but has not yet reached the point of publicly recognizing the use of extraordinary means to postpone tax payments, and there is a saying that the opposition party is behind these movements, so it should be seriously guarded against. Second, those who forcibly demand salary reductions for elementary school teachers and city and town officials on the grounds of poor local finances must exercise supervisory power to stop them. Third, automatic salary reductions by local public officials will be recognized. Fourth, loan elimination movements and the creditor-debtor relationship must proceed through free contracts, and there is no obstacle. If it is a general movement, it means destroying the private property system, and decisive measures will be taken.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 29th: Since taking office, President Hoover has dispatched various investigative committees. Opponents of the government mostly use it as an excuse to criticize the current administration, but Hoover firmly adheres to his own views, saying that in the future, more intelligent people will be needed to investigate the country's important affairs. He said that his policy of dispatching committees is not an innovation. The government of former President Roosevelt established 107 committees, President Taft 63, President Wilson 160, and President Harding 44. Even former President Coolidge, whose policies are said to be the opposite of his own, also established 118 committees. From this, it can be seen that he is not fond of creating things.</p>

<p>Last year, the National Government sent Minister Wu Chaoshu to negotiate an arbitration treaty with the United States. After several months and more than ten rounds of consultations, a final draft was reached. The content is quite perfect. In the past, most of the treaties that our country signed with foreign countries were based on foreign languages, and some were accompanied by Chinese, but they were only listed for reference and had no effect. This time, the arbitration treaty has a separate clause stipulating that Chinese and English have equal effect. In the event of any discrepancy between Chinese and English, French will prevail, which is sufficient to correct the shortcomings of previous treaties. It is reported that at 11:45 am on June 27th, Minister Wu and US Secretary of State Stimson exchanged credentials and signed the treaty at the US State Department. The content of the treaty stipulates that if a dispute arises between China and the United States, it must be submitted to the arbitration court for adjudication. The treaty was drafted in duplicate, and the Chinese and American governments each hold one copy. The copy held by China lists Chinese first and then English. Minister Wu signed before the US Secretary of State signed, and Minister Wu only wrote the three Chinese characters Wu Chaoshu, without signing his English name, which is also a model of not being humble or arrogant when signing treaties in the future. People in the US State Department said that the first arbitration treaty signed between China and the United States was handled and signed by Wu Tingfang, the father of Minister Wu Chaoshu. This time, the treaty was renewed and signed by the son of Dr. Wu, which has been praised as a good story in the history of Sino-American diplomacy.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Investigation of the Yuchuan Vessel Smuggling Case Concluded <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Investigation Committee Reported to the Headquarters that all were Private Smuggled Goods</p>
<p>The Headquarters Will Order Confiscation and Punishment of Offenders</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Yuchuan vessel smuggling case has been under investigation by the Investigation Committee organized by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters for more than a month. Now the investigation has been completed. Based on various documents, it has been determined that all the goods on the vessel were privately smuggled. The Headquarters will order confiscation and punishment of Shen Gongli, the former director of the special tax office who sheltered the smuggling. The following is an excerpt from the Investigation Committee's report to the Headquarters: "We, the committee, were ordered to organize on June 12th, convened a discussion meeting of all members on the 13th, passed regulations, and announced the establishment. We started the first phase of the investigation on the 15th and completed it on the 27th. All the regulations of our committee and the meeting minutes during the investigation period have been reported for review and approval, and have been sent to various agencies for record. Later, He Liqing, a member of the provincial government, stated that most of the members of the provincial government were going to Henan, and the meeting minutes of our committee could not be discussed at the meeting, and asked to suspend the meeting for a week. Later, a temporary meeting was convened on July 3rd, a joint meeting with the liquidation committee on the 5th, and a regular meeting continued on the 7th to carry out the second phase of the discussion work. On the 12th, we were ordered to inspect the special goods together with the Jingbei Command and the Han Office of the Economic Management Department of the Special Tax Office on the 15th. On the 14th, we jointly decided on the method and procedures for inspection. From the 15th to the 20th, the inspection of the special goods was completed. All inspection information was also reported for review and approval. Since the 20th, meetings have been held daily for discussion. As of today, the second phase of the discussion has been completed. All the main points, in addition to the detailed information in the meeting minutes, review reports, and proposals of various members, are submitted with the text for your review. Herewith, we translate the most important points and report them to your headquarters separately. According to Article 1 of the special tax of Hubei Province, all special goods from Sichuan that enter Hubei Province must be weighed, stamped, and taxed at Yichang. Below Yichang, all goods that have not been stamped will be treated as private goods. This time, the Yuchuan vessel loaded special goods from Yunnan and Guizhou and arrived directly at Hankou. The Jingbei Command believed that the vessel was carrying armed soldiers and was anchored in the heart of the river. During martial law, it was necessary to inspect the vessel. Furthermore, the second section of the special tax office stated in its official letter that the goods were transported directly from Chongqing to Hankou without stamping, and that many private goods were mixed in. This is sufficient to show that all the goods carried by the vessel were private goods. In addition, Liu Fuqing, the main person in charge of trafficking on the vessel, fled and did not appear, which is even more proof that the goods were smuggled. The official letter from the provincial government to the Jingbei Command also stated that the goods were transported directly to Hankou, and there were obviously malpractices in it. The Supervisory Committee's reply to your headquarters also stated that since it violated the past regulations, there were many doubts. This is the reason for Party A. As for the letters from Shen Gongli, the former director of the special tax office, and Chen Shaogui, the current special financial envoy of Hubei, they stated that the joint transport of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hubei had been approved on file, and that the special tax office had telegraphed the Supervisory Committee and the Finance Special Envoy's Office in advance about the direct transport of goods from the Yuchuan vessel to Hankou. This is the reason for Party B. After repeated review by our committee, Party B's reasons were inconsistent with the facts. Shen Gongli, the former director, and other personnel related to the case, were indeed guilty of dereliction of duty by engaging in fraud and self-enrichment. (The evidence is (1) the joint transport case was implemented first, and reported to the ministry later, (2) it was reported and replied only after the ministry inquired, (3) it was reported to the ministry as joint transport, but in fact it was direct transport, (4) no record was found in the headquarters or the Supervisory Committee, (5) there are no provisions for the agreed method, and the telegram was issued afterwards and not sent to the provincial government at the same time, (6) direct transport has been carried out many times, but it was never reported to the Supervisory Committee, and only the special goods of the Yuchuan vessel were reported for verification.) In short, according to the usual practice in Hubei Province, special goods passing through Yichang that have not been stamped are private goods. The special goods of the Yuchuan vessel have not been stamped, and the so-called joint transport method was not filed with the relevant agencies in advance. Even if it was reported to the Ministry of Finance afterwards, there was no such direct transport method, and the telegram was only reported to the Finance Special Envoy's Office and the Supervisory Committee, but not to the provincial government, which is definitely a post-hoc issuance. Moreover, direct transport has been carried out for a long time, but only this time there was a post-hoc report, which is even more proof of its attempt to cover up. There is much other evidence, which has been detailed in the meeting minutes and review documents, reports, and proposals of various members, which is sufficient to prove that the dismissed director of the special tax office, Shen Gongli, and other personnel related to the case colluded and shielded private transport. It is certain that they should be severely punished according to the crime of dereliction of duty to warn against corruption. The Heki Company induced special merchants to shield private transport. Its collusion with the special tax office and sharing of the spoils is obvious. Please follow the general seat's Jia You telegram order and confiscate all the special goods sold by the company according to the private goods regulations and severely punish them. The other special merchants, although they were deceived, also have the suspicion of trying to reduce taxes, and should be subject to appropriate punishment to show a clear warning and prevent future offenses. The more than 80 loads of private goods that exceeded the originally reported weight during the inspection should be confiscated together to supplement military expenditures. As for Liu Fuqing, as a soldier, not only transported opium, was fully responsible for negotiating tax reductions, profited from it, colluded and shared the spoils, and also mixed in many private goods to use as funds for the movement of troops and his reactionary plans. The opium he trafficked was definitely rebellious goods, and there is no need for review. It was previously reported for confiscation during the inspection. Although the rebel has fled to avoid punishment, we request that a strict order be issued to arrest him and bring him to justice to uphold the national law and make corrupt officials aware of the need for vigilance."

<h3 id="e69">Record of Wang Jingwei's Passage Through Tianjin <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Special Security Measures by Land and Sea</p>
<p>News Reporters Temporarily Banned</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Wang Jingwei's northward journey has been rumored and changed repeatedly. It wasn't until the 20th that Hu Zongduo received a radio telegram from Wang on the Changcheng Maru, briefly stating that they would arrive in Tianjin on that day. Given the urgent military situation and the hardships endured by the soldiers at the front, all welcoming and social events should be omitted to avoid unnecessary waste. Slogans and banners that could easily cause misunderstandings should especially be avoided. Please convey this to all comrades, etc. Upon receiving this telegram, the Pingjin (Beiping-Tianjin) sides finally believed that Wang had indeed come north and began preparing a welcome on the 21st. At that time, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin wanted to show goodwill to Wang, so he telegraphed the Changcheng Maru, requesting special protection for Wang, and notified the Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau to pay attention to the safety of Tianjin and Gu. At the time, the military and police authorities believed this deeply, but later found it had no basis in reality. Chen Gongbo, Huang Shaogu, Zhang Zhiben, and Zang Zhuo all arrived in Tianjin by train from Beiping on the evening of the 21st. Feng Yuxiang's representative, Xue Dubi, and Yan Xishan's representative, Mai Jingde, arrived in Tianjin by train on the morning of the 22nd. At 3 PM that afternoon, a meeting was held at Hu Zongduo's residence, No. 142, 11th Evening Road, British Concession, to discuss security arrangements for welcoming Wang. After a long discussion, the following measures were decided: (1) Land routes: Dagu, Tanggu, and Xinhe were to be the responsibility of the Tangda Public Security Bureau and the local garrison. Junliangcheng and Tianjin Beicang were to be the responsibility of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau and the Gendarmerie Headquarters. Yangcun to Langfang was to be the responsibility of the garrisons at each station. North of Huangcun was to be the responsibility of Beiping. (2) Haihe River: This area was to be the responsibility of the Dagu Coastal Defense Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Water Police Bureau. (3) The Beining Railway Bureau was to prepare a special train to Tanggu for the welcoming party, the fewer people welcoming, the better. The Tianjin All-Circles Representative Assembly for welcoming Wang was not allowed to convene, as the military and political authorities feared that a large crowd would be difficult to manage. At the same time, the joint offices of the various district party headquarters also planned to hold a citizens' welcoming rally at the Grand Theater after Wang arrived in Tianjin, but this was also stopped by the Garrison Headquarters. Initially, representatives from all sectors were allowed to welcome him at the station, but this was later also disallowed. (4) The Liaison Section of the Garrison Headquarters was to prepare temporary badges. Anyone without a temporary badge would not be allowed into the station. The Garrison Headquarters was to prepare accommodations for Wang. A group of news reporters requested to accompany the special train to Tanggu to welcome Wang, and negotiations continued late into the night without result. Once the arrangements for welcoming Wang were finalized, the Japanese Consulate was asked to notify the Osaka Company not to announce the arrival time of the Changcheng Maru. At 7:20 PM, Lu Weigan, Fu Rulin, Zou Lu, Guo Taiqi, Deng Cuiying, and others arrived in Tianjin from Beiping. At 5 AM on the 23rd, four Japanese reporters took a passenger train to Tanggu. At 8:40 AM, Mayor Cui Tingxian, Gendarmerie Commander Yuan Qingzeng, and representatives from various parties from Beiping, a total of more than 40 people, departed by special train. The Public Security Bureau sent a special task force director, Li Hanyuan, leading six detectives to accompany the train. The special train arrived at Tanggu at 10:30 AM. Yuan Qingzeng proposed in the train to use the special train as a decoy. He suggested requesting the Coastal Defense Headquarters to send a small launch to meet Wang as he disembarked, and then transport him to Tianjin via the small launch. This would ensure that Wang would be neither on the special train nor on the Changcheng Maru, and would be more secure. Chen Gongbo said that the special train would arrive in Tianjin in 70 minutes, and it was stable and fast, so there would be no danger. Everyone agreed. The Changcheng Maru arrived at Dagu at 9 AM and stopped, waiting for the noon tide to enter the port. It did not stop at Tanggu when passing by. Cui Tingxian, Yuan Qingzeng, Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, and Xin Bosen urgently boarded a small boat to chase after it and signaled by sounding the horn. The Changcheng Maru then slowed down and lowered the rope ladder. Wang, Gu Mengyu, and Zeng Zhongming disembarked and shook hands with the welcoming party one by one, and then boarded the special train. Due to having to yield to the third special express train at Xinhe, they did not arrive in Tianjin until 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>After Wang entered the Municipal Government, he first rested in the West Reception Room, and then went to the East Reception Room for lunch. Cui Tingxian was publicly elected to deliver a welcome speech, and Wang delivered a reply. The meal ended at 3 PM. At 3:20 PM, the Changcheng Maru arrived at the Osaka Wharf in the British Concession. Chen Bijun and others disembarked under the protection of Zeng Yanyi, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and rested and dined at the National Hotel. Reporters from various newspapers then visited Wang at this time. Wang's secretary, Zeng Zhongming, came out to meet them, saying that Mr. Wang was tired and could not talk for long. The reporters asked for a ten-minute interview, and Wang agreed. The main points are recorded below: "I originally planned to go north from Hong Kong on June 25, but I suffered from bronchitis and was treated for more than ten days before fully recovering. I only set off on July 15. I arrived in Nagasaki on the afternoon of the 19th, and took a night train, and switched to Moji on the morning of the 20th. I took the Changcheng Maru to Tianjin at noon. No one knew when I left Hong Kong, so I did not meet with local overseas Chinese and overseas comrades when passing through Nagasaki and Moji. However, many Japanese reporters came to visit. Due to the rush of time, I only made a brief conversation. There were no newspapers to read on the boat, so I don't know if the records published by Japanese reporters have any discrepancies with my meaning. Gu Mengyu is traveling with me, and Chen Shuren will also arrive. Before leaving Nagasaki, I telegraphed Bo Liewu and Zhu Zhaiqing to go north. I had a brief conversation with Japanese reporters on the special train in Tanggu. My trip north was at the repeated invitation of Yan Feng and various parties. I will make efforts in party affairs. Some people say that a certain faction of the Kuomintang is now compromising with a certain faction. Little do they know that this compromise has a purpose. It is like Commander Yan said, 'Courtesy and concession for the country.' Comrades should be courteous to each other and not contend with each other," etc. At 4:30 PM, Chen Bijun went to the train station from the National Hotel. At 5 PM, Wang went to the train station. At 5:30 PM, he left Tianjin for Beiping with Zou Lu and others. (July 24)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Record of the Destruction of Sacred Sites in Qufu <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>When the Jin army advanced south and surrounded Qufu, the mausoleums and temples of the Former Sage were all destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe for Qufu. The loss to the Temple of the Second Sage, Yan Hui, was particularly severe. This reporter followed the army to inspect the Confucius Temple and saw that most of the front and back corridors were filled with wounded soldiers. The scene was extremely tragic. Arriving at the Dacheng Hall, the northwest and northeast corners were both destroyed by artillery fire. The Madam's Hall, which had recently been renovated, was also damaged. The Library Pavilion was hit by seven shells, and countless sections of the walls were destroyed, making it easy to enter from anywhere. It is difficult to describe all the other damage, and many of the ancient cypress trees, several arm spans around, were also broken by shells. One shell fell and penetrated the trunk of an ancient cypress tree, blasting several cracks in the tree trunk. Knocking on it with a hand, one could hear a hollow sound. The ground was covered with trees and debris, mixed with tiles and rubble from the shells. This cultural source for thousands of years, a famous building in China and abroad, has suffered such an unprecedented catastrophe, and it is truly regrettable. The most severely damaged part of the city was the Temple of the Second Sage, Yan Hui. The temple is near the north city, with towering buildings and luxuriant pines and cypresses. Although not as large as the Confucius Temple, it is quite magnificent. It received</p>
<p>approximately one thousand or more artillery shells and not one patch of clean soil remained. What is strange is that the hall was bombarded above, below, in front, behind, left, and right, but the statue of Yan Hui stood tall and undamaged. Even the statue of his father, the Duke of Zou, Yan Lu, was unharmed. Here is a brief record of the</p>
<p>extent of the damage to the Yan Temple: (A) Hall of the Second Sage: (1) The main spring was smashed into three large pits, each more than a zhang wide. (2) One beam of the east mountain was blown off. (3) The upper and lower purlins at the back were penetrated, and three large square beams were broken. (4) The east mountain wall was penetrated in two places, and the entire ridge of the east mountain was knocked off. (5) The large beast on the west mountain was blasted off. (6) The northeast corner pillar was broken. (7) All the dougong (bracket sets) on the west side were knocked off. (8) All the green tiles above were smashed. (9) A total of fifteen sections of the surrounding stone railings were destroyed. (B) Back Sleeping Hall of the Second Sage: (1) The ridge of the east mountain was knocked off. (2) The back was penetrated in three places, one beam of the east mountain was broken, and two rafters were broken.) (C) Hall of the Duke of Zou: (1) One section of the main ridge was blasted off. (2) The</p>
<p>back main beam. (3) The shrine was knocked off. (D) Back Sleeping Hall of the Duke of Zou: (1) One rafter was blasted off. (2) Two sections of the main ridge. (3) The shrine was knocked off. In addition, the east and west chambers were damaged in a total of twelve places, the northeast corner of the Yuelou was destroyed in one place, the Yansheng Gate was knocked off to the northwest, one square beam was broken, the east and west memorial archways were destroyed in a total of five places, the Temple of the Three Dynasties was completely destroyed, the back of the Tuisheng Hall was completely damaged, the east and west kitchens were completely damaged, the back of the Guiren Gate was damaged, a pillar of the front eaves of the Keji Gate was broken, two main beams in the back, the back of the Fuli Gate was damaged, the front of the Fusheng Gate was damaged and the water square timber was broken, the main ridge was knocked off, the north mountain wall of the Fuwen Gate was penetrated, the main ridge was knocked off, the Yuemen was destroyed in three places, the Nanji of the Zhuoguan Xianke arch was knocked off, six sides of the stone railings in front of the temple were destroyed, the surrounding wall was destroyed for more than ten zhang, and dozens of trees inside the temple were destroyed. The above records were investigated by Yan Shiyong, the 77th generation descendant of the Second Sage. From what this reporter saw, there was much more damage.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Danger at Ninghai Pond in Zhejiang <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Hanghai Seawall is related to the safety and security of the people in seven counties, so the water conservancy authorities have always paid close attention to it. However, the Water Conservancy Bureau suddenly changed its plan this time, removing all the old stone ponds and rebuilding them as sloping new ponds. The design was indeed scientific, but the construction was sloppy. The inauguration ceremony was held on the 13th of this month, but recently, a typhoon passed through Zhejiang, and the tides were surging. All the Bingzi, Yuezi, and Xiyi Datang areas were destroyed by the tide, and the situation was extremely critical. The entire county of Haining suffered untold losses. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent an urgent telegram to the Provincial Government to request instructions. Chairman Zhang, after receiving the report, has urgently ordered the Provincial Public Security Bureau to temporarily borrow all cargo trucks of various agencies and businesses, with the oil expenses to be borne by the public. He also ordered the district offices to hire hundreds of laborers to carry large quantities of burlap bags and other materials, and to depart today (30th) at approximately 11:00 to rush repairs and protect the lives of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Reorganization of the Secretariat of the Zhejiang Provincial Government <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shiyuan, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Secretary-General, is physically weak. Since assuming the position of Secretary-General, he has been working tirelessly day and night, and his energy has become increasingly unsustainable. He recently resigned his position as Secretary-General to the Provincial Government. At the 327th meeting of the Provincial Committee, Chairman Zhang Jingjiang proposed the appointment of Liu Shixin as Acting Secretary-General, and the appointment of Shen Zhennan as Chief of the Second Section, Luo Xilan as Acting Chief of the First and Third Sections, Liu Tingyin as Accountant, Wu Houyuan as General Affairs Officer, and Shen Ru as Seal Officer. All of them arrived at their posts yesterday. As for the organizational structure of the Secretariat, it is rumored that there will be quite a few changes. In the future, it is planned that Civil Affairs and Finance will be managed by the First Section, Construction and Education will be managed by the Second Section, Supervision of Justice and Administrative Litigation will be managed by the Third Section, and Party Affairs will be managed by the Fourth Section. In addition, a Director will be added to both the Accounting and General Affairs departments to specialize in their respective responsibilities. This plan is currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Provincial Committee for decision and implementation after it is drafted.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Urgent Dispatch from Wuhu <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Huangji Ferry in Nanling County, dozens of miles from Wuhu, was looted by bandits the day before yesterday, resulting in extremely heavy losses. The Wuhu County Government and military authorities, considering that the area borders Wuhu and according to reports, the bandits numbered about 150 to 160, each with a box cannon at their waist and wearing black Shangyun gauze jackets and pants, looking very fierce, set fire to the town and looted it, killing two members of the local militia, burning one person to death, and kidnapping more than 20 people. One group fled towards the bandit den on Wuhua Mountain in Fanchang, while a large number remained entrenched in the Chenjia Ferry and Majia Ferry areas near the town. In addition to dispatching a team from the County Government to block the bandits at Shiqiu Town, County Magistrate Sun also issued an urgent order in the name of the director of the Ten County Joint Defense Office to the three counties of Nanling, Xuancheng, and Fanchang, ordering them to quickly dispatch local militias and garrison troops to encircle and suppress the bandits to prevent the situation from spreading.</p>
<p>Bandits were previously discovered in Guangde County in southern Anhui. The tenth company of the third battalion of the garrison troops stationed in the county engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits, killing more than 40 people, capturing more than 20 people, and seizing several local rifles. The bandits then dispersed. The soldiers of that company, assuming that the first company of the relieving troops had arrived, originally planned to return to Wuhu for training. However, hundreds of bandits reappeared in the Dashan area in the west of the county, and their momentum was very strong. In addition to the self-defense militia in each district of the county dividing up the area to prevent the bandits, that company also stayed in Guangde to join forces with the ninth company to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Li Fanyi, a member of the Anhui Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department, arrived in Wuhu yesterday from Nanjing. He originally planned to return to the province that evening, but because the Shuiodong Coal Mine in Xuancheng, which is run by the province, needed to be inspected and reorganized, he went to Shuiodong this morning with Jin Weinong, Director of the Bureau of Mines, and Shao Yizhou, Director of the Wuhu Municipal Office, by long-distance bus from Xuancheng and Wuhu for inspection. He is scheduled to return to Wuhu tomorrow and then return to the province.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government received an order to investigate the properties of the Three Dukes Temple in order to confiscate them and use them for education. After investigation, it was found that there is a Li Gong Temple on both sides of the 蟂矶 Temple on the opposite side of the river in Wuhu, which is not a private property of the Li family. However, it is not known whether public funds were used during the construction or whether it was donated by local people. Yesterday, the Wuhu County Government was specially ordered to investigate and report in detail for disposal.</p>
<p>The principals of various provincial secondary schools, because the Anhui Finance Commissioner's Office owed a large amount of school fees, publicly elected Zhang Xibai and others to come to Wuhu on behalf of the school union to urge the Commissioner's Office to pay the fees. The newly appointed Special Commissioner Bao Geng has agreed to clear the arrears in three installments in the second half of the month. The first installment of 100,000 yuan will be paid at the end of this month, and the remaining installments will be paid on the 6th and 10th of next month. The principals have now returned to the province.</p>
<p>The Management Committee for Wounded and Sick Officers and Soldiers of the General Headquarters sent personnel to Wuhu to inspect the convalescing wounded soldiers at the Fifth Rear Army Hospital. This has now been completed. All the 160 or 170 wounded soldiers who have recovered and can return to their units will be transported to Pu by the newly hired Xinshengli steamship tomorrow morning by the Military Reception Office and then transferred to the front.

<p>Meeting of the Price Stabilization Bureau. Since the implementation of the Price Stabilization policy, the Shanghai rice market has suddenly declined day by day, with a difference of several yuan. Moreover, the Price Stabilization Bureau originally proposed that the Price Stabilization price in each district should be uniform, and the general bureau would set the price every five days and notify each district to issue rice at the price. However, in recent days, the price of rice has fallen daily, so that the market price is inconsistent within five days, which is not as good as the daily market price of rice merchants. Therefore, each district has requested to negotiate the price independently. Today (30th), the General Bureau specially convened a meeting of the Price Stabilization Committee and the district chiefs to discuss the issue. It was concluded that if each district set the Price Stabilization price independently, the difference would inevitably be too large. Therefore, it was resolved that the price would still be set by the General Bureau, but each district could handle the matter according to the situation. A unanimous resolution was passed. The second issue of funds was then discussed, and it was resolved that each district should receive the funds immediately.</p>

<p>A Robbery Case Occurs in the City. In the vinegar warehouse alley inside the Fengmen gate, at the house with number 56 occupied by the Chai family, a robbery happened in July of last year. After this incident, it has been a year, only two or three suspects have been found, but the real stolen goods and robbers have not been caught. To everyone's surprise, yesterday (30th) morning at about 4:00 AM, four robbers suddenly came to the Ge Yuanlong Trauma Clinic, number 5 of the vinegar warehouse alley. They came under the pretense of needing medical attention and then proceeded to rob. The details are as follows: In the Ge Yuanlong Trauma Clinic, there is a mother, Ge Wang Zhenru, (age 69) who also treats people's injuries. They hired a rickshaw puller named Feng A Si, which has been two years. After Feng A Si came to the Ge family, he was considered relatively reliable. Recently, Feng suddenly changed his attitude, because he knew that the owners of the house were only the elderly Ge Wang Zhenru and her young grandsons, Jin Fu, Zhen Shan, daughter-in-law, and female worker Guo Wang Shi. Therefore, on the 29th, he pretended to be sick and asked for leave, and hired Xiao Yang to take his place. After Feng asked for leave, he returned to his home at number 2, Huizhu Lane, Dutaiping Alley, and gathered four people, including Huang Jiuzhang, Kong Zhaoyang, Zhang Rifu, and Dai Xiaomao. They discussed at his home a plan to rob the homeowner. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, Feng A Si accompanied Huang Jiuzhang and the other three to the Ge family's front door. At this time, Ge Zhenru and her grandson Zhen Shan had already gotten up. Feng A Si entered first to find out that Ge Yuanlong did not live at home the previous night. So he took a copper coin out to wet it. He then ordered Huang Jiuzhang to enter and rob. After the four bandits entered, one bandit pretended to have a leg injury, so Ge Wang Zhenru crawled over to examine and treat it. Unexpectedly, another bandit used cloth to cover Ge Wang Zhenru's eyes and did not allow her to make a sound. One bandit was keeping watch outside, and another bandit took off two inlaid gold rings and one pure gold thread ring from Ge Wang Zhenru's hand, as well as one round pure gold bracelet from her arm. At that time, Ge Wang Zhenru resisted slightly, and the bandit knocked out one of her front teeth, and blood flowed like a waterfall. After the bandits obtained the stolen goods, they fled to the nearby Jiaguan alley. Afterwards, Feng A Si then returned from wetting the coin, and accompanied Ge Wang Zhenru to report to the second branch of the Public Security Bureau in the alley. Then Ge Yuanlong also went to the bureau to report. According to Ge Wang Zhenru, the bandits resembled rickshaw pullers. After receiving the report, the head of the Pan branch telegraphed the detective team to assist in the arrest, and ordered the police in the bureau to search everywhere to track down the robbers. Then, Wang Xing San, a police chief from the flying squad, was investigating the household of a police officer named Ding Jie, and arrested Huang Jiuzhang in the Waque Lane. Xue Yijun, a detective from the detective team, and Huang Ziyun, a police officer from the branch bureau, arrested Kong Zhaoyang at the entrance of the Chayuan Square in Guanqian. Detective Wang Wenyuan and others arrested Zhang Rifu inside the Panmen gate. Zhang patrol officer from the bureau went to the uncle of Zhang Rifu, Zhang Da Laohu stove in the Gaodun lane mouth in Wuque bridge to search for the original stolen gold bracelet and three gold rings. It was taken after the head of the Pan branch briefly reviewed it, that the case was instigated by Feng A Si, and he confessed to the robbery.

<p>New Details on the Robbery of a Steamboat and Kidnapping Case. A case of lake bandits robbing a steamboat, kidnapping people, shooting and killing a water police guard, and robbing weapons occurred near Wangyewan in Hengjing, Jiangsu Province, at 7:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. The Department of Civil Affairs appointed Gong Guoliang, District Chief of the Third District, as the commander of the Taihu Bandit Suppression, and joined with the Suzhou-Wuxi Water and Land Police Force to encircle and suppress the bandits in the lake. He had already organized a temporary headquarters in Suzhou yesterday. Mao Mujun, District Chief of the Second District, is currently stationed in Dongshan, constantly patrolling the lake surface. He once encountered a bandit ship, but was unable to catch up and was forced to flee to Zhejiang Province. District Chief Gong received a letter from the bandit side yesterday, stating that Wang Wusheng, the captain of the Eighth Team, and the 27 hostages were all safe, but a large sum of money was required (one said 500,000 yuan) before they could be released. In addition, the conditions were also harsh. Wang Wusheng's family has also received a letter from Wang, stating that he is being well-treated in the bandit's den, but he must obtain a large sum of money before he can be free. According to the letter, in addition to actively suppressing the bandits, a team was sent to Shanghai to negotiate with the bandits in order to balance toughness with flexibility. As for the bandit organization, it is actually made up of the Pudong and Chaohu gangs of Hunan. The general headquarters is in Shanghai, and although Zhong Zhaokui is coming forward, there is actually another person behind him, and there is a background.</p>

<p>Police Chief Commits Suicide Due to Poverty and Illness. Zeng Jixiong, the police chief of the Tenth Sub-Bureau of the Ninth District (North) Public Security Bureau, has been suffering from illness recently, which comes and goes. Although he has been treated, it has not been effective. He also felt that it was difficult for a family of several people to make a living. On the 26th, he invited Wang Ming, an employee of the bureau, to his home and asked him to send a letter to his brother, saying that he had been ill for a long time and was determined to commit suicide. After Wang returned to the bureau, he reported the information to Bureau Chief Wang Weixin, who immediately sent a letter to Zeng's home to inquire about him. The day before yesterday, he sent Police Officer Chen Yunlong to deliver 10 yuan, instructing him to rest and recuperate. Unexpectedly, that afternoon, Zeng suddenly threw himself into the river and committed suicide. By the time he was pulled up, it was already too late to save him.

<p>Drastic Fall in Rice Prices Shortens the Date of Price Stabilization. This year, the price of rice in this county has gradually soared, becoming unstoppable. Gaobai rice has risen to as high as 19.67 yuan per shi, which has seriously affected the livelihood of the poor. It is generally expected that in June and July, during the lean season, the price of rice per stone will break the 20-yuan mark, and no one is not hoarding it to wait for a good price. Unexpectedly, in the recent ten days, more than 200,000 shi of foreign rice were shipped into our county, so the price of rice suddenly plummeted. Yesterday, the market price of white rice was only 16.5 yuan per stone, and the price of dumplings was about 12 yuan per stone. However, no one asked about the rice stored by the unscrupulous merchants. When the price of rice was high, the county chamber of commerce convened a meeting of various industries to raise funds for stabilizing prices. Because the price of rice has fallen, the price stabilization date has been shortened, and the donation money recognized by various industries has been returned by half. Yesterday, special letters were sent to various industries to come and collect the receipts. At present, the price of rice on the market has a tendency to continue to fall, which is a boon for the future of the people's food.</p>

After the inquest, the coroner Yu Guigui was ordered to collect the body, cut the corner, seal it, and send it to the altar for temporary placement, awaiting identification by the corpse family.</p>

<p>Collection of Boat Tax Still Under Consideration: Shi Yulin, Sha Ruiying, and others, proposed establishing a Jiangyin County boat tax in Jiangsu Province, modeled after Zhejiang and Anhui, to increase national treasury revenue. They also drafted organizational regulations, with the tax based on the size of the boat, charging 50 cents per zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) in length, with larger boats taxed accordingly.

<p>Conflict Between County Police and Public Security Branch Bureau Over Soil Investigation: On the morning of the 23rd, according to a report from Detective Yao Maotang, a large shipment of opium would be transported from Hankou that night. County Magistrate Wang immediately ordered the police squadron leader, Wang Gongyi, to personally lead twenty plainclothes officers to lie in wait at the ports of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th weirs. Around 1 a.m., a Jardine Matheson's Whampoa steamer arrived from upstream and unloaded passengers at the 8th weir. Sure enough, many opium dealers were carrying loads on their shoulders and in their hands, disembarking one after another. After inspection by the water police and the Public Security Branch Bureau, the county police carried out a third inspection. The opium dealers immediately said, "We have already made arrangements, there is no need to inspect again." They also asked, "Which unit are you from?" Upon hearing this, the county police were certain they were opium dealers and proceeded to arrest them. Dai Ziping, the water police patrol officer of the 8th weir, Chen Yi, the director of the Public Security Branch Bureau, and the third regiment commander of the 7th district, upon hearing the news, led their units to the scene and ordered the arrest of the "bandits" without asking for any details. The county police officers presented their identification symbols, but Bureau Chief Chen did not bother to check and instead ordered the officers to beat them, resulting in injuries to officer Ma Chenglong. The opium dealers took the opportunity to escape, and a security regiment member even helped carry three loads of goods, while Patrol Officer Dai personally took away one package. Detective He Fengshan of the county police then grabbed a female opium dealer, Li Wangshi, and found 21 packages of opium on her, weighing a total of 42 ounces. The Public Security Bureau took the group to the bureau, where the officers were guarded by police, and their weapons and symbols were confiscated. After a while, Squadron Leader Wang heard the news and rushed from the 7th weir, showing the secret order to Bureau Chief Chen for inspection. Bureau Chief Chen then released the detained officers and blamed them for not informing him beforehand. Squadron Leader Wang argued that the secret order required strict confidentiality and could only be revealed as a last resort. Bureau Chief Chen disagreed, and another conflict arose. A county police officer, dissatisfied, questioned Bureau Chief Chen and engaged in insulting behavior. Later, both sides reported to the county government. Ma Chenglong's waist was found to have injury marks, and a certain officer was accused of insulting his superior. County Magistrate Wang ordered 200 strokes of the military stick to be administered as a warning. Li Wangshi's opium dealing case was sentenced to four months of imprisonment and a fine of 4,800 yuan. Director Chen and Squadron Leader Wang will be prosecuted separately by the judiciary.</p>

<p>This time, the Chinese Expeditionary Football Team is temporarily using the name "Lehua Team" in Singapore. The Hua Nan and Hua Football Teams have come south one after another, attracting the attention of people in the southern region. The Chinese Team originally intended to travel together, but due to various reasons, it could not be done. However, players Cao Guicheng and Chen Guangyao of the Chinese Team have already come with the Lehua Team. Thus, it can be said that three of the Chinese players have met with people in the southern region. After they compete separately, they will form a team and rename it the Chinese Expeditionary Football Team to travel to Europe. However, after arriving in the southern region, the Lehua and Hua Nan teams, aware that the prices of rubber and tin in Malaya are declining daily, causing great suffering to the people, and that the number of unemployed people is increasing daily, filling the streets, feel strongly that these unfortunate people urgently need relief. Philanthropists in Kuala Lumpur are actively seeking ways to provide relief, which is also a matter of urgency. The players, aware of this situation, have volunteered to help. They plan to fulfill their commitments in Dutch Java first. After completing their matches there, they will return to Kuala Lumpur and invite teams from various cities in Malaya to form a selected team. They will hold a special match on a selected date, and half of the proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be used to maintain the unemployed workers. Currently, everything is actively underway. It is hoped that when this event is completed, the unemployed workers will be grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Inspection of Military Education Achievements in Jiangsu and Zhejiang <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Training Department Requests the Ministry of Education to Review and Implement Rewards and Penalties for Various Principals</p>
<p>The Training Supervision Department previously sent personnel to inspect military education in high schools and above in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. This has now been completed. People in society and officials from schools in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are eager to know the results of the inspection and the comparisons made. The reporter has learned that the department's letter to the Ministry of Education provides a detailed account of the inspection of various schools and has separately imposed rewards and penalties. The original text is reproduced below:</p>
<p>Training Supervision Department Advisory (Education No. 79) Regarding the matter of consultation, this department dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Cheng Bingren and Wang Zemin in early April to inspect military education in high schools and above in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. They returned to the department one after another in June and submitted separate reports on their findings. Now, after a comprehensive review of the performance of each school by this department, with the exception of those with no significant strengths or weaknesses, which will not be discussed,</p>
<p>Those to be rewarded: It has been found that the Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang High School, the Zhejiang Ningbo Private Xiaoshi High School, the Shanghai National Labor University Agricultural College, the Jiangsu Provincial Changzhou High School, the Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School, the Zhejiang Hangzhou Private Physical Education College, and the Zhejiang Provincial Tenth High School have performed well. This demonstrates the enthusiasm and guidance of the principals and the effective training of the instructors and assistant instructors, which is commendable. Chen Jing, principal of Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang High School, and instructor Gan Yanan; Feng Du, principal of Zhejiang Ningbo Private Xiaoshi High School, and instructor Zhang Yuanzhi; Yi Peiji, president of Shanghai National Labor University, Li Lianggong, dean, and instructor Cao Shengwu; Zheng Tonghe, principal of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School, and instructor Cao Wenlin, assistant instructor Chen Bingkai; Jiang Menglin, president of Zhejiang Provincial Senior High School, and instructor Wang Weijian, assistant instructor Wang Yingjun; Jiang Menglin, president of National Zhejiang University, Li Ximou, dean, and instructors Dai Shixun and Lai Xujiu; Zhu Lu, principal of Jiangsu Provincial Changzhou High School, and instructor Ma Guoyong, assistant instructor Bai Hongfei; Zhou Houshu, principal of Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School, and instructor Zhou Chaofan; Kong Yong, president of Hangzhou Private Physical Education College, and instructor Lai Xujiu; Shou Jiajun, principal of Zhejiang Provincial Tenth High School, and instructor Jin Zhenkui should be given a major commendation each in accordance with Articles 2, 4, and 5 of the Regulations on Rewards and Penalties for Military Education in High Schools and Above to encourage them.</p>
<p>Those to be warned: Furthermore, it has been found that Huang Wei, the former military instructor of Donghai High School, was appointed in March of the 18th year of the Republic and left his position in July of the same year. The school concealed this fact and did not report it. In November of the same year, this department ordered the National Military Education Department to directly inquire with the school, but there was no response. It was not until late April of this year that the school reported the matter and requested that Wang Wenying, the school's general affairs officer, concurrently serve as military instructor, intending to perfunctorily fulfill the inspection, resulting in the interruption of military education at the school for as long as ten months. The principal and instructor of the school are hardly blameless. The academic atmosphere of Rugao High School is extremely poor, and discipline is lacking. Shouting and noise can be heard in the classrooms and on the playground. Military education facilities are non-existent, and academic performance is also mediocre, which is negligent. Zhu Lingdou, principal of Donghai High School, and Wu Yingfu, principal of Rugao High School, should be given lenient warnings separately for their failure to effectively implement military education to encourage them to be more diligent. Huang Wei, the former instructor of Donghai High School, should be dismissed for dereliction of duty and permanently barred from appointment. Wu Churui, the instructor of Rugao High School, should be given a major demerit in accordance with Article 11 of the Regulations on Rewards and Penalties to show a minor punishment for his poor teaching and unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p>Those to be improved: Furthermore, students at Zhejiang Provincial Seventh High School do not understand the academic subjects. The technical subjects, with the exception of the first and second-year students of the Normal Department, are not only unskilled but also lack enthusiasm and appear to be acting as children. The reasons for this are (1) the principal and instructor have different opinions, (2) the number of students is too large, and one instructor cannot handle them all. Principal Fang Hao and instructor Xie Dingyuan of the school should be ordered to pay attention to this matter and make improvements. Furthermore, only one-fifth of the students at Shanghai National Jinan University receive military training. Although the performance is good, it is not widespread enough, which is not in accordance with the regulations. The school should also be ordered to rectify this.</p>
<p>In addition to the rewards and penalties for military instructors, which have been registered and notified for compliance by this department, the rewards and penalties for the principals are hereby requested to be reviewed and implemented by your ministry in accordance with the regulations, and to be notified to all provincial and municipal education agencies and schools for their information. This is in accordance with official etiquette. Furthermore, it is stated that National Central University and Private Jinling University have not yet been inspected due to the summer vacation. This consultation is to the Ministry of Education, He Yingqin, Training Supervisor.</p>

<p>B: Of course I'll return it to you. I'm a man of my word and never break promises. However, tomorrow I'll also have to ask you to lend me another hundred dollars. The previous debt can be offset, and you only need to give me ten dollars.</p>
<p>Wife: Our child is simple-minded. There's no need to rush him into marriage. We can wait until he's a bit smarter before he gets married.</p>

<p>Everything is difficult at the start. Do not be the first to act. Who will be after? Mei Lanfang spared no effort to cross the ocean to develop art. To create a new era for Chinese opera. Its merits cannot be concealed. Lanfang has returned with honor. The public who opened the farewell party before. Another welcome party was held in Dahua. Its grand occasion is no less than last winter. Lanfang was troubled by the sweltering heat. Stayed in Shanghai for a few days. Wait for the ship to return north. Nothing to do in his spare time. Talking about his experience in the United States. According to Yun. There is a language barrier between them and us. Relying on interpreters to guide them. Therefore, before the opening, the interpreter must first explain the various dramas to be performed in detail. Let the audience understand it in their hearts first. Then open. This move has been very effective. Four plays are rehearsed every day. Only the first and last dramas are complete. Only two episodes are performed in the middle. When I first arrived in the United States, the first play performed every day was The Palace Man Assassinating the Tiger. The second play was performed by other actors in one episode. The third drama only performs a sword dance or a feather dance. The last drama is Fenhe Bay. In this way, after two weeks. Only then did they change to performing the first play, Drunken Concubine. The last drama is Killing the Family. Only one scene of Killing the Family is performed. Slightly add or subtract the old script. Change student to vice. Yidan is the right ear. After each play is over. Be sure to close the curtain once. And the audience in the audience. Then there is no curtain call. Usually there are four or five curtain calls at most. But sometimes when the audience is warmly welcomed. There are as many as ten curtain calls. The palace people's original intention in performing Ci Hu was to assassinate Li Zicheng. Hu mistakenly hit the deputy car. After the assassination. The palace people also regretted it very much. Viewers pay close attention to this expression. It can be seen that people in America are very aware of drama. Observation is deep and subtle. Also, our country's actors. Can be increased or decreased at will. In the United States, acting is like a stereotype. No additions or deletions are allowed. It also shows one aspect of their strict viewing psychology. The play Drunkard. Only describe the drunken state and jealousy of Concubine. To the original lustful excitement after drunkenness in the play. Made all kinds of dirty gestures with Gao and Pei. All are deleted. The knowledgeable people sighed for the improvement. In summary. The fame of his art is not a coincidence. Lanfang also said. This time, Europeans living in the United States. Very much looking forward to going to Europe via the United States. To comfort the thoughts of the people of his country. But only prepared for traveling to the United States in advance. And did not have time to travel to Europe. And on the side of the office staff. Talents who are familiar with the situation of European countries must be sought. And in terms of drama. Also, how to improve and adjust. All can be settled in a short time. It is planned to prepare after arriving in Ping. Only this time when I went to the United States twice, I was treated very warmly. Yunyao Jin Feng is refreshing. Go to Fusang to perform for two or three weeks. Has become a promise. Probably going east after autumn. And a certain stage owner on the sea. Then wait for returning from Fusang. A special performance will be retained for several days.</p>

<p>Since Zhenjiang was returned as the provincial capital. All facilities. There has been a lot of progress. I happened to visit here a few days ago. I will choose its trivia. Send the facts in this talk.</p>
<p>More and more hotels in Zhenjiang. The Jiangbian area is the most famous. Compared to the provincial government's move. Crown Gai travels back and forth. Suddenly it was lively. The hotel industry is also developing in a special way. In terms of the new buildings. The Zhenjiang Hotel is the best. All equipment. Completely Western style. The rest, such as Wanquanlou, etc. Also working hard to refresh. Arrangements Chuchu. Every day, the room. Mostly there is a problem of supply falling short of demand.</p>
<p>The cold food business is booming. The weather in the town is hot. Compared to the sea, it's almost too much. Therefore, the cold food business. Extremely developed. Such as the Meishi Li Western Restaurant, etc. All are elegant in the room. Not much different from the top. Kuai Huo Lin is located in the park. Zhenjiang Park is Yushan. In this hot summer. After logging in. Everyone is strangely thirsty. Kuai Huo Lin is located in the middle of the mountain. So the business is booming. The guests are always full.</p>
<p>Cooling off by the river. The Jiangbian area. Relatively empty. By the evening, residents who were cooling off by the river were following each other. But sometimes the sky is clear. The wind does not expose the dust. Even to the river. It can't relieve the heat. Only a steamship is available for rent. You can board the ship and take a spin. Unfortunately, the price is too high. There are few people who ask about it. There are still a few swimming in the river beach. Walking around with companions. No different from the Bund.</p>
<p>Strange lack of Chinese restaurants The Jiangbian area was originally a British concession. Negotiations to take it back. It hasn't been long. Although the market is booming. But if you want to find a Chinese restaurant where you can sit down. Just impossible. Therefore, I walked around a big circle. Went with an empty stomach. Returned with an empty stomach. To talk to classmates. I was laughed at by Xian.</p>

The lotus root is shaped like a round. It is known to everyone. Ice muscle and jade bones. Simulate tender lotus root as jade arm. This is actually a commotion. Good at description.

<p>As a result, a group of fans had to change their plans. One after another, they camped in the baseball field the night before. Carry a blanket to keep out the cold. One box of Bento to fill the stomach (Bento is one of the most popular lunch boxes in Japan. The meals are simple and sufficient for one meal. The prices are very cheap. There are several types such as five cents, three cents and two cents. It is the most convenient travel ration.) A wide square. It was like a refugee settlement. Get up at dawn. Queue up to compete for priority to buy tickets. The cunning people also used this as a business. Led several trusted people. After buying tickets, They transferred them to others at five or six times the price. Profit is doubled. The authorities believe that this situation has many drawbacks.

Then, according to the order in which the postcards are received. Send out tickets. The first time it was held. A total of more than 300,000 postcards were received. It can be called grand. May 19 was the first battle between Keio and Waseda. Both sides were more concerned by the society due to the championship relationship. After one o'clock in the afternoon. The area around Meiji Jingu Gaien was blocked. The reporter had the honor to be there. With the special permission of the Sports Association. I once visited the field for a week. The audience was packed with people. The crowded situation. Unprecedented in the country. And tens of thousands of people stood outside the field quietly listening to the news. Various shops of all sizes in the streets are equipped with wireless radios. Report baseball battle reports. Very detailed. All the actions of the players and the batting situation are expressed. In front of the big company's gate, there is a record board. The reports of the wireless radio are published on the sign. Therefore, the entire city of Tokyo is like a large-scale baseball field. The device in the big store. The pronunciation is clearer. There are always dozens or hundreds of people listening in front of the door. Coffee shops and tea rooms are booming. In between wins and losses. And the expressions on the faces of the customers. Also different. A friend of mine studied at the Imperial University. He said that during the competition. All the teachers in the school were drunk and crazy. Trial room classroom. Each set is equipped with a crude wireless cylinder. Hang on the ear. Listen to the news.

<p>(4) An Overview of the Works of 1929 (Below)</p>
<p>To the left of Ponna are three paintings by Charles Guerin. His color is after Cezanne and seems to be more advanced in color beauty. Although he has the meaning of inheriting Cezanne. He also wants to make realism thorough to the extreme. Recently, he has been using passionate eyes to write portraits of modern women. But can skillfully draw the bottom of the hearts of modern women next to it is a large nude painting by Osi Bania Eespagnat. A still life painting. The portraits of these two writers are competing to hang side by side. Probably because they are both colorists with special personalities. So put their works together. Osi Bania gradually moved from Renoir's painting style to more shaky brushstrokes. Exaggerating the feeling of strangeness. Opposite him are two still life paintings by Pirre Laprade. Thickly stacked with strong colors. It is like the pattern of colored glass. Roughly make a high and low feeling painting style. To its left. It is the Parisian fashionable writer Asilang's Asselin "Human Body". It is painted with a naked woman sitting in the middle. A child next to him. A piece of cloth in front. To its left is Favry's "Bath". This is really the most remarkable point in many paintings. Further on is a painting by Galo Per Krobg. These three people are from three different aspects. Each opened an end for the emerging art of France. They occupy an equal position in the modern Paris art world. Favry strongly emphasizes self-emotion. Asilang inherited Sedan and wanted to capture the permanent natural reality from space. Garo then tried to discover new life in the completely barbaric flavor from the primitive aspect. If fine art is only a faithful copy of natural appearance. Then the retina is completely a kind of camera. The hand is only a kind of machine. The work is just like a photo. Favry uses the object as a medium to realize himself. Asilang uses color. The shape is solid to the end. Structure to make the inner self's publication originally the essence of art is not in the copied object. But in the creative self-internality. Therefore, the purer the art, the more directly it can express this kind of inner spirit.</p>
<p>Let's talk about our tour. Oh. What big paintings. What is painted is the tragic situation of Jesus on the cross. That is a painting using modern methods and taking religion as the subject matter. This corridor. The walls on both sides are full of paintings of this kind. I feel that Jesus is either as terrible as "Yaksha". Or as pale as "Impermanence". There is also a black lacquered group. It is a Mo Jing-like face. The strong and chaotic sense of color. It's really incomprehensible. Ah ah. There is Demenusse and Margnerite Crisay's paintings. They pay great attention to the meaning of sublimity. In order to transmit the pleasure of beauty. There is also Camorn's "Port". He is good at using bright colors to express a kind of intensely vibrating technology. Going further into a room is hanging cubist paintings. A piece of red like flames. A piece of black like charcoal. Blue diagonal stripes. Goose yellow background. Filled with greater charm will gradually stimulate our hearts. Om This is a masterpiece by Georges Braque, a famous figure in Cubism. He reduces objects. Independent and patterned. Describing still life paintings of musical instruments contains a strange expression in the excitement. Created purely from the artist's imagination. And the actual nature has nothing to do with it. Go all the way. You can see Kiscling's "Portrait" and a pot of "Flowers". This is the most special work representing Northern Europe today. He is far apart from Matisse's painting. And Pablo Pieasso's main body of the school is also absolutely different. There is a kind of magical stimulation in the seriousness. He is the only foreigner in the Autumn Salon. This is Lotiron. This is Friez. This is Hagninoya. This is Simon are all famous artists. I'm really too busy to pay attention. I can only name a few at random. If you talk about the famous artists of this year's national products. Really like a cartload. Let's talk about it again at any time.</p>
<p>On the lower level. Dozens of magnificent and unique new-style wooden furniture. There are also many crafts and fine arts. But we are outsiders and have no interest in it. So I just walked through it hastily. Alas. There are many sculptures in the north and south corridors. Although we love it very much. But there is no ability to interject. This is the first time we have been swimming for half a day. May 1 is the official day of opening. That's really a sea of people. There is really no way to stay. After that, I went there about once a week. Every time I go. I always feel reluctant to stay. Can't go.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Finance: Bullion Price Ascends Steadily <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The market trend is quite good, with a further increase of over nine taels. Yesterday's gold market felt very sharp, and the trend was quite good. However, in the morning session, there were signs of underlying weakness, with fluctuations of eight taels, causing uncertainty and instability. Exchange rates strengthened, and listed prices narrowed by half a point. Trading was brisk in the market, with companies such as Taikang Yuancheng Yong, Hengxing, and others, as well as short sellers, all covering their positions. Sellers included Shunli, Wanxing Yuansheng, and Jin'an. Other firms had mixed trading activities, likely due to differing psychological factors. Although large bars initially declined slightly in the morning, they stabilized and fluctuated slightly. Later, major players aggressively entered the market, and exchange rates tightened, causing a sharp rise of seven or eight taels. Subsequently, many bulls liquidated their positions, and foreign exchange seemed to weaken, leading to a decline of six taels. A slight recovery was seen at noon. In the afternoon session, speculators bravely bought in, with Taikang Run, Yuancheng Yong, and Chengfeng Yong aggressively accumulating positions, while Hongli Xiang and Fuchang sold. Foreign exchange was not traded due to Wednesday's market closure, but the upward trend of bullion prices was very consistent, with differences of up to ten taels. Initially, the market was peaceful, but it weakened as sellers increased. Later, major players competed to buy, creating a bullish atmosphere, and the price broke through the eighty-tael mark. Investor sentiment remained strong. Yesterday, the price of large bars fell by three-sixteenths, and silver prices contracted by one-quarter. Exchange rates remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e112">### Gold prices in September initially stood at 572 taels, with a slight drop of 3 mace, even higher than the closing price of the previous day. Gross trading accounted for over 2 taels up and down, from 74 taels and 8 qian to 2 taels and 8 qian, and the foreign exchange rate seemed to be insufficient. The British gold rate for the September bank counterparty was 6 pence 6875, and the October settlement was reduced by 125 to 6 pence 75 to shillings. The US dollar was 25, and the Japanese gold rate rose by 75, but it was not moved. The clock was in the 73 tael range, but it soon dropped to 72 taels, which was sold by retail customers. At 10:00, the rise began to be seen, as major customers such as Yuancheng Yong and Taikang Run rushed to buy, and the exchange rate also rose. Korea sold 1 tael, 3 qian, 1 fen and 375 at Dalian, and the Orient absorbed half a shilling of next month, so the price went up step by step, and at 10:50 am it rose to 79 taels and 8 qian. After 11:00 am, the situation suddenly turned weak, as Zhikang, Yuancheng Yong, and Fuchang tended to sell, and the foreign exchange market was also easy to relax, so it dropped to 73 taels and a half. There were two more taels in and out until noon, and then it closed at 75 taels and 6 qian, which was pulled up by Hengxing and others. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<h3 id="e113">### In the afternoon, the rising momentum continued. The afternoon market opened at 75 taels and a half, followed by 6 taels and a half. Later, the sellers were encouraged, and it had already dropped by more than 3 taels, and at 2:20 pm it was 73 taels and 1 qian. The opening of the Indian Exchange News reported a contraction, and the people's hearts were shaken. At about 3:00, it was 78 taels, and Taikang Run bought it, and suddenly suppressed it by 2 taels and 0, and then added 3 taels immediately, and at 3:00 it was 79 taels. This is because there are more or less changes in and out of the desk, and at 3:30 pm, I suddenly heard that the Indian Exchange turned to 34, and it has been reduced to 76 taels and a half. Afterwards, the market situation frequently increased by more than 6 taels, and Taitai Kang Run and others, on behalf of a certain bank comprador, widely accepted it, and immediately reached the color, exceeding the 80 tael mark, and at 4:15 it reached 83 taels, but there were two taels of twists and turns, and after a while, it was reduced by 2 taels, and the long side took the opportunity to sell, so it was 81 taels, and the closing at 4:30 pm was 581 taels and 6 qian, which was 9 taels and 3 qian higher than the previous day. Since entering this week, a total of 245 taels have been raised, and yesterday was Wednesday, there was no foreign exchange market, and the gold price actually broke through 80 taels, which was really unexpected. <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<h3 id="e114">### The maximum price before and after the check was about 60 taels, and the maximum price was 83 taels, and the minimum price was 72 taels, with a difference of more than 11 taels. The price was 637 taels and 8 qian, which was the Japanese gold that had been marked by 75. The first check was 65 taels and 6 taels, then 58 taels and 9 taels, and the afternoon collection was 62 taels. The afternoon market was checking 623 taels, to 65 taels, and then only suppressed 567 taels.

<h3 id="e119">Unusually High Volume of Foreign Exchange Transactions <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was the settlement period for various securities and public bonds for the current month. Banks and money houses were busy with the procedures for cash transactions, collateral, and trading, leading to an exceptionally high volume of foreign exchange transactions in both markets, setting a new record for the year. In terms of credit conditions, many settlements were made yesterday, resulting in abundant funds and a relaxed atmosphere in the market. Although this oversupply is a common occurrence at the end of the month, the extent of the oversupply varies.</p>
<p>Interest Rate: (Foreign Interest) The morning trading was exceptionally lively. There was no clear trend in interest rates. As a result, demand was strong, and the closing rate fell to 7 qian, 2 fen, and 8 li, a slight decrease of 8 hao and 7 hu and a half compared to the previous morning. The afternoon trading remained active but was not as strong as the morning. As a result, the interest rate rose slightly by 2 hao and a half, to 7 qian, 2 fen, 8 li, and 2 hao and a half, a slight decrease of 6 hao and 2 hu and a half compared to the previous morning. (Silver Interest) The morning rate opened at only 2 fen, indicating a severe oversupply. Therefore, the afternoon rate was zero, setting a new precedent in recent months. It goes without saying that bank rates, overdrafts, and water additions were not an issue.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small foreign coins showed a good sign. The morning rate was 6 qian, 3 fen, and 1 li, and the afternoon rate increased by 3 or 4 li, to 6 qian, 3 fen, and 4 li, a significant difference from the previous day.

Qianzhuang and silver houses received over 43 million in individual receipts, 4.7-4.8 million in overdraft funds, over 1.2 million in remittances from various sources, and 2-3 million in cash. Many merchants deposited funds. (Foreign Coins) Due to settlement considerations, there was a particularly high volume of exchange transactions. The morning volume was 3.91 million, and the afternoon volume was 2.015 million, totaling nearly 6 million, surpassing any busy time this year. The amount of banknotes was limited, with only 5,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes totaled 113,000 in the morning and 75,000 in the afternoon. As a result, bank transactions were also exceptionally high, with interbank trading totaling 2.1 million in the morning and 950,000 in the afternoon. Bank receipts and disbursements with foreign accounts totaled over 2.5 million, and banknote inflows and outflows totaled slightly over 2 million. As for the sources of funds, it felt calm.

<p>Settlement Price 157 Taels: Settlement Volume 1,900 Bales</p>
<p>Hengda Had the Most Goods Received: Taishengkang Delivered the Most Goods</p>
<p>The market for July standard yarn was extremely weak at the beginning of the month, mainly due to the global cotton industry slump and the downward trend of grade three yarn, which made investors nervous and the market unstable. The sales of spot yarn were sluggish, and the current situation of war was confusing, so the market price hovered between 154 and 155. Later, the manufacturers adopted a firm attitude, and the Cantonese gang searched for futures in the market, and the standards also absorbed a large number, with both inside and outside advances, the amount of packages was about tens of thousands of packages. Xuzhou Gang also launched the purchase of spot yarn, so the people's hearts were excited, and most of the psychological factors were due to the fact that this year's Geng Year has a prosperous outlook, and there may be a large number of transactions in the autumn, and there are not a few people who tend to do more. At the end of the month, actual sales were smoother, and the market price was even tighter, and the highest price once reached 158 taels. The result of the settlement price was 157 taels, and the number of settlements was a total of 1,900 packages, with 1,300 packages actually settled, and the remaining 600 packages were settled by themselves. The goods are 100 packages of ten branches of the earth, 250 packages of three sheep, 350 packages of ten product branches of Hong Tuanlong, 550 packages of sixteen branches of aircraft, and 50 packages of twenty branches of picking flowers. The largest manufacturer, Hengda, received 1,300 packages, and the rest were received by the Guangdong gang. The largest number of deliveries were 400 packages of Taixing on the 28th and 500 packages of Taishengkang on the 22nd.

<p>Since the Jinchao problem in July, the highest price of Biao Flower was 37 taels and 8 qian. Later, due to the flaws in the US flower, the gold price fell slightly, and the major households took the opportunity to sell. The market situation took a sharp turn and hovered at the price of 35 taels and 34 qian at the beginning of the month, but Hengda manufacturers tightened 10,000 dan and did not let go. The market saw that the trend of US flowers was not good, and the number of those who shorted increased day by day, and the market situation was extremely weak. Later, because of the sudden short squeeze in August, the market in this month was driven higher, and it was once seen at 36 taels and 4 qian. Hengda took the opportunity to sell and close out when the price rose. Once it was released, the market atmosphere suddenly relaxed, and the US cotton fell again, with a virtual image for a while, and the lowest was 34 taels and 7 and a half qian. At the end of the month, the short squeeze in August was extremely high, and many people who bought and套out August went high again. The result was that the delivery price was 35 taels and 5 qian, and the delivery volume was 14,500 dan. The largest number of goods received was 6,700 dan from No. 8 Heshen, and 2,200 dan from No. 15 Yuda. The largest number of deliveries was 2,500 dan from No. 33 Shenchang.

<h3 id="e123">Spot Yarn and Flower View in the Midst of Delivery <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is very strong, and people's hearts are good. It is believed that most of the psychological factors are that this year's Geng agriculture has a prosperous harvest, and it is expected that the sales of spot yarn may have a large development, so there are many people who do more. The Cantonese gang is particularly keen on searching for spot yarn in the market. The demand for spot yarn is not as strong as before. However, the overseas flower and yarn markets have softened, and it is difficult to see a decline in the short term. It is expected that there will still be a rise in standard yarn tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are Lighter Yesterday, each gang bought 573 packages of spot yarn, and 520 packages were advanced in the industry. The market was slightly firmer. Most of the customers were bought by Guangbang, accounting for 250 packages, 90 packages were imported from Niuzhuang, 40 packages were imported from Shantou, 50 packages were imported from the mainland, 50 packages were imported from Sichuan, 40 packages were imported from Tianjin, 40 packages were imported from Yunnan, and 20 packages were imported from other gangs.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Grain: Foreign Rice Market Before Early Rice Comes Out <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Customers' Appetites are Not Strong: Han Gang Returns: Market Continues to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market still showed no improvement. In the morning, the demand from customers was sluggish, and the prices of various types of rice showed signs of decline. Later, the Hangzhou Gang purchased small-grained brown rice, and the Yantai Gang purchased Saigon large-grained rice, which slightly stabilized the market. However, sales were limited, and there was a large amount of inventory. The inventory of large-grained rice and brown rice was even more sufficient, so the market continued to soften by 3-5 points. The total market transaction was 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 at a price of 16 yuan and 6 jiao, 200 bags of No. 2 at a price of 13 yuan and 4 jiao, 200 bags of small-grained rice at a price of 14 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen, 200 bags of Min Dang at a price of 14 yuan and a half, 1,500 bags of large-grained rice at a price of 12 yuan and 05 fen to 11 yuan and 7 jiao, 1,000 bags of small-grained brown rice at a price of 11 yuan and 3 jiao to 10 yuan and 08 jiao, 500 bags of Su Geng rice at a price of 14 yuan, 8 jiao and 7 fen, and 100 bags of Ke Gai at a price of 14 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<p>It is also reported that before the foreign rice arrives in a crowded condition, various places are rushing to place orders, and the orders are settled, and then the arrivals surge, so the ports that need it are also crowded. In addition to the Han Gang going out a few days ago, they have also ordered several batches. At present, early rice will be on the market next time, and the inventory of rice is difficult to sell. In recent days, some of it has been transported back to Shanghai from Hankou and will seek to sell it at a reduced price.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Flour Market Loosens Greatly Before Delivery <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Near and Distant Fall by 2 and a Half Points Each</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was stable in the morning. The foreign wheat quotations decreased by 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 jiao. However, the people's hearts recovered and loosened again. At the beginning of this month, the factories were suppressed, and there was no possibility of a small drop. However, it was heard that a part of the short sellers had agreed on the market value with the factories and settled with each other, so the short squeeze in this month was seemingly cancelled without a trace. As the situation in this month loosened, those who were thinking about the distant future turned to the short side again. In the afternoon, because the degree of decline in the morning had suddenly turned into a swirling image. However, the final closing price of this month has dropped to 2 taels and 5 qian. It is said that a certain factory is still preparing to deliver warehouse receipts, which is as high as 60,000 to 70,000 packages, so the closing is so loose. As a result, this month fell by 2 and a half points compared to the previous day, August and October fell by 2 and 2.5% each, September and November fell by 2 and 7.5% each, and December fell by 2 points.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Chinese and Foreign Wheat Prices Fall Consistently <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed an initial stability followed by fatigue. August saw stability when it first opened. Foreign wheat was reported to be small, and the gold price was much shorter than the previous time, so most people's hearts were consistently low and tired. Since the flour market has also turned down, the wheat market must also follow suit. As a result, August and September fell by 5 points compared to the previous day, October fell by 4 points, and November and December fell by 5 points. Due to the factories' removal, the current wheat can still be connected, so although the standard has returned, it has not seen a big shake. The opening prices of each file have not changed much from the previous day. It is said that the Yao Bay Chen Wheat, Shashi, Shaobo, Ying, Zhenjiang, Jiangxi, Mingguang, and Gaoyou wheat totaled more than 10,000 bags and were taken away by Fuxin Fufeng, etc.</p>

<p>Yellow Silk Indian Sales Still Not Lonely</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port was still calm. Although the factory-managed Lyon had needs, the French exchange rate turned long, but the electricity transfer price was still not high. Manufacturers believed that the cost of silk was still high, and it was difficult to sell smoothly. Yellow coarse silk Indian sales were still not lonely. Yesterday, Baili and others imported 20 packages of white factory-managed silk to Shanghai, and Xiangji and others imported 30 packages of yellow coarse silk. The price was still stable.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Gongxi Green Tea Russian Sales Smooth <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Gongxi Green Tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi and other roads assisted in the search and purchase efforts, and the total transaction volume in the city reached 1,159 boxes, with selling prices ranging from 42 taels to 80 taels. According to the current estimate of the Gongxi inventory on the market, it is quite felt that the supply is insufficient. However, for the Zhenmei item, British banks and traders are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, and Chinese tea merchants are deeply worried. According to the news from the production areas of Tunxi and Wuyuan, most of the tea-making firms have ended their business, and it is expected that this year's tea number will be about 4/10 less than last year.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Miscellaneous Goods: Inferior Canton Twigs Rise One Taël <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shuikeng Tungzhi twigs, selected by Zhuang Ji, arrived in over a thousand boxes the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the various shops in the north and south markets opened for business separately, and all the longan shops distributed them. However, the cost of these inferior twigs has slightly increased, and because the price is suitable here, the market is lively. Therefore, the opening price and market price have both risen by one taël. It is said that another thousand boxes are expected to arrive in later batches, and the market price is expected to remain stable.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Textiles: Eastern Fabrics Slightly Soft, Moonlight Velvet Still Rising <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Native cloth: The trend remains firm. Yesterday, the Southern gang completed over three hundred pieces. Twelve-pound "Human Clock" fine cloth and nine-pound "Cat's Neck Jubao Basin" coarse cloth were almost completely bought up. The Northern gang, including Niuzhuang, Tianjin, Dalian, and other ports, is also quite active. Fine cloth is purchased daily, so even in the off-season, prices are rising rather than falling. Yesterday, only blue "Double Fish" fine twill slightly fell by two and a half fen due to end-of-month loan settlement. "Yang Crane" spot goods are still in short supply. Coarse twill has slightly moved in this street, all for dyeing purposes, and the price is also slightly firm.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Fabrics: Yesterday, Eastern goods were slightly soft, mainly because the July shipments previously ordered by fellow traders have been arriving in Shanghai in succession these days. The June shipments require loan settlements upon arrival, so opening prices have generally fallen slightly. Yesterday, "Baoqiu" fine poplin fell by two and a half li, colored stripes fell by five fen, and dark-colored "Ting" fell by two and a half li. Cotton flannel remains sluggish. Local customers are hesitant to step forward due to this situation. Moonlight velvet alone is showing a thriving trend. "Large Chicken Cage" has been sold for one taël, nine fen, and two and a half li; "Medium Handle Fuhua" for one taël, eight fen, and two and a half li; and "Small Chicken Cage" for one taël and eight fen, a rise of two and a half li. The reason is the continued rise in the fixed price and the unusually active participation of customers.</p>

<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Cai Pei, the acting Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, repeatedly declined the position to Minister Wang. However, after Wang consoled and encouraged him, Cai agreed to temporarily serve as acting director, maintaining the status quo. Yesterday at around 11:00 AM, Cai arrived at the company to assume office. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially hung the Party and National flags to show their welcome. The General Management Office specially dispatched Secretary-General Xu Xiuzhi and Wang Hao, director of the Hankou branch, to greet Cai at the Director-General's office on the second floor. Cai did not bring anyone with him. After arriving at the company, there were no speeches or other formalities. He only invited the current section chiefs and heads of various departments to the office to inquire about the company's situation. He also ordered the heads of each section and department to inform all employees to continue to work diligently, stating that he was temporarily maintaining the status quo. When the National Government appoints a responsible commissioner, he will hand over the position immediately. Currently, all matters will continue to be handled according to the methods of the previous Director-General Zhao, following precedent to maintain this transitional period. Later, Cai met with guests and reporters. There are no changes for the time being.</p>
<p>It is also reported that before Cai's arrival at the company, he consulted with Finance Minister Song Ziwen on financial matters. As a result, 200,000 yuan was allocated from the charter fee to meet expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Wind Weakened Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Ocean Liners Sailed as Usual</p>
<p>The continuous strong winds in Shanghai and the typhoon entering the country have been reported in previous issues. It is now known that the typhoon has penetrated into the interior. Therefore, the customs storm warning ball has been lowered, and ocean liners have successively left port. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Typhoon in Shanghai Gradually Weakened: Since the night before last, there have been occasional showers in Shanghai, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes falling, sometimes stopping. Yesterday, the wind gradually weakened, becoming even smaller in the afternoon and with no strong wind sounds in the evening. However, the showers during the day have not stopped, resembling autumn weather.</p>
<p>The Typhoon Penetrated into the Interior: The day before yesterday, the typhoon turned north-west from Wenzhou and entered Jiangsu province, passing between Zhenjiang and the capital, and crossing the Yangtze River to the north. According to a report from the Yangjingbang Observatory at 4:00 PM yesterday, it was then located between latitude 33 degrees and longitude 118 degrees, approximately in the area near Chuzhou on the Jinpu Railway. It is still difficult to predict whether its trend will change or continue north, as its progress was quite slow at that time, and it is also difficult to determine the strength of its force. However, Shanghai has avoided being directly hit.</p>
<p>Ocean Liners Sailed Yesterday: The liners that were prevented from sailing on Monday and Tuesday due to the wind sailed yesterday as the wind gradually subsided. The Jiahe and Wanxiang, bound for Fuzhou, have already departed. The Guangsheng of Jardine Matheson missed its port of entry and will return directly to Hong Kong and Guangdong today instead of going to Qingdao. The Xin Beijing, Xin Ningjing, and Shao, bound for Ningbo, also resumed sailing yesterday. The Chicago, which was delayed outside Wusong for three days, has also arrived in Shanghai. All the ships delayed en route are expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Mediation Failed Yesterday in the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession water and electricity workers' strike, since its occurrence, has been going on for four weeks, lasting for a long time, causing inconvenience to traffic in the French Concession. Since the central government sent Wang Xingzhou to handle everything and instructed Central Committee member Li Shizeng to oversee the matter nearby, there seemed to be a possibility of a sudden turn for the better within three days. However, according to yesterday's news, the two sides are insisting on their respective conditions, making it difficult to resolve the issue immediately, and there is a tendency for it to gradually expand. The details are compiled and recorded below.</p>
<p>Attitude of Central Committee Member: Since being entrusted by the central government, Central Committee member Li Shizeng has been engaged in mediation. He previously contacted Chen Junyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Training Association, by telephone and met him at his residence to discuss the matter. Li expressed sympathy for the workers' strike as a last resort, but also said that prolonged delays are not a long-term solution. It would be best to turn major issues into minor ones and minor issues into nothing. Therefore, his advocacy is to strive to mediate from the root. Yesterday at noon, he invited Chen Junyi to meet again to continue the discussion, but he was obstructed by other matters and the meeting did not take place.</p>
<p>General Assembly: A general membership meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, with over 600 people in attendance. Xu A'mei was publicly elected chairman. After reporting on the conversation yesterday, Chen Junyi of the Municipal Training Association instructed the union to send representatives to contact Du Yuesheng. The union sent Zhou Dexing, Zhang Liansheng, Hu Chunlin, and Jiang A'shan as representatives. Du's mediation conditions included three items: (1) a wage increase of two yuan and four jiao per month; (2) wages to be paid during the strike period; (3) the company to dismiss 50 workers. All the workers unanimously rejected the conditions on the spot. It was then reported that 100 yuan in relief funds had been received from the Support Association. The following resolutions were then made: (1) The company should be responsible for all medical expenses for injuries sustained in the "721" tragedy; (2) An advertising team should be organized to go to all sectors to effectively publicize the cause; (3) A fundraising team should be organized to solicit donations from all sectors to relieve the livelihood of fellow workers; (4) The case of ticket sellers No. 49 and No. 205 assaulting Shen Fusheng, ticket inspector No. 13, should be submitted to higher authorities and the police station for strict investigation and punishment; (5) In the future, any discovered "running dogs" will be dealt with severely by the union.</p>
<p>Staff Meeting: A staff meeting was held at 10:00 AM, with over 170 people in attendance. Chen Hongyuan was publicly elected chairman. The meeting reported on the progress of union affairs and then discussed proposals. Finally, Xu A'mei of the Machinery Department gave a speech, including the following proposals: (1) To send a letter to the board of directors of the French Water and Electricity Company in Paris, urging the Shanghai representatives to quickly resolve the strike without prejudice; (2) To organize an advertising department, with Zhu Zhaohua, Tang Peishun, Yan Yushu, Sun Dianhou, Xu Hongzhao, Tang Keqing, Zhang Huisong, Sun Zhiyu, Fan Sitao, Lu Yongxing, Liu Jiqing, Shen Shengshan, Dai Mosen, and Rao Shuliang as members. A meeting was reconvened at 2:00 PM to discuss advertising methods.</p>
<p>Traffic Department Meeting: A joint meeting of all ticket sellers, track switchers, and lamp operators of the Traffic Department was held yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, with over 400 people in attendance. Shen Keming was publicly elected chairman. The meeting reported on the progress and discussed proposals. Finally, Dai Mosen and operator No. 83 gave speeches. The following resolutions were made: (1) Cases of any workers not obeying union discipline or sabotaging the labor movement should be submitted to the Municipal Party Department for disciplinary action according to law; (2) If workers from any department do not attend the meeting, the department heads should be responsible for handling the matter; (3) The case of driver No. 49 and ticket seller No. 205 acting barbarously and assaulting ticket inspector Shen Fusheng should be handled by having all workers be responsible for constantly searching for the residences of the two and strictly arresting and punishing them.</p>
<p>Traffic Department Demands: The workers of the Traffic Department put forward the following demands yesterday: (1) The union has the right to represent the workers; (2) Eliminate fines for letting passengers on after the bell rings and for not shaking the route sign; (3) Eliminate fines for missed stops, missed tickets, and all false accusations by ticket inspectors; (4) No stops allowed without "grease money"; (5) Daily work limited to eight hours, otherwise wages will be increased accordingly; (6) The company should be responsible for any accidental mishaps during driving; (7) No fines for derailments, track departures, or broken bells while the vehicle is on the road; (8) Eliminate harsh penalties for arriving at stops too early or too late; (9) Wages should be paid during the strike period; (10) Track switchers, lamp operators, ticket sellers, and drivers should be treated equally; (11) Workers with minor offenses should not be questioned in the company office; (12) If a roll call is penalized, half a day's wages must be paid.</p>
<p>Declarations of Assistance from Various Unions: The Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Servants' Union issued a declaration yesterday in support of the strike of the French Concession water and electricity workers, stating that the union, based on the friendship of the same class and the feeling of "a rabbit mourning for the death of a fox," is willing to lead all workers to pledge their support and fight together to achieve victory. (1) The Fresh Pork Butcher Ship Workers' Union issued a declaration yesterday in support of the strike of the French Concession water and electricity workers, stating that all members of the union are filled with righteous indignation and should give full sympathy and assistance, work together in the same boat, pledge their support, and strive for national glory.</p>

<p>Changsha Telecommunication Stops Cargo Handling: Yesterday, the Changsha gang formally received a telegram forwarded from Hankou, instructing the Shanghai-based merchants to immediately stop purchasing goods and to temporarily store all purchased goods in Shanghai warehouses and not ship them.</p>
<p>Ning Shao's Engine Damaged and Towed to Shanghai: The Ning Shao Company's Lao Ning Shao ship, heading to Yuezhou this time, was heavily loaded with a deep draft. The river water was very shallow in that area, causing the engine blades at the stern of the ship to be damaged and lost, rendering the ship unable to move. A tugboat has been dispatched from Hankou to tow it to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>
<p>British Ships Lower Prices to Compete for Cargo: The British-owned Butterfield &amp; Swire Company's import and export business along the Yangtze River has not been very successful this year, often operating at only 20-30% capacity in recent months. The company has therefore adopted a method of sacrificing costs and lowering fees to attract customers and compete with Chinese and Japanese ships. All import and export freight rates have been reduced to 88% of the original price, and a rebate is also given, with the intention of gaining an advantage in business. This matter is already being implemented.</p>

Tea, in particular, has slightly decreased due to French restrictions. Yesterday, the French Postal Company decided to increase the prices of Chinese goods shipped from Shanghai to Annam, destined for Haiphong and Saigon, by 25% to 30% of the original price due to the secret losses from the rising gold price.

<p>Formal Negotiations to Begin in September</p>
<p>The National Government has recently been making great efforts to recover the telecommunications rights of various countries. The Da Dong and Da Bei Telecommunications Bureaus have been jointly negotiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications and are in active progress. Japan also has telecommunications bureaus in various parts of China and has had submarine cables in Shanghai, Nagasaki, and other places for sending wired telegrams for a long time. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Communications has requested Foreign Minister Wang to negotiate a solution for recovery. When Foreign Minister Wang visited Shanghai last time, he met with Japanese Acting Minister K. Shigemitsu on the 28th at the Diplomatic Discussion Meeting on Avenue Joffre and negotiated for about an hour. Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu has received instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Communications to accept the negotiations. However, detailed procedures still need to be requested from the Japanese government. Therefore, the two parties are currently discussing various preliminary issues and procedures for formal negotiations, exchanging private opinions in advance to prepare for formal negotiations, in order to ensure smooth progress in the future. Acting Minister Shigemitsu and Foreign Minister Wang have agreed to begin formal negotiations in early September. At that time, Acting Minister Shigemitsu will personally go to Jinling to meet with the two ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications to discuss this issue. The Japanese government agency in charge of this matter is the Ministry of Communications, and it is possible that the Ministry of Communications will send another expert to China to assist in the process.</p>

<p>Departing in Five Routes</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese merchants, recognizing the stagnation of domestic production, which has made it impossible to solve the national economy and people's livelihood, have automatically pooled capital and returned to China to invest, seeking to develop various domestic production industries. The general situation has been reported in previous issues. The group has been divided into five teams and has departed for various locations to conduct survey work. The routes are: the first team to the Northeast; the second team to the Northwest; the third team to the Yangtze River area; the fourth team to Guangdong and Fujian; and the fifth team to Yunnan and Guizhou. The members of the group who have arrived in Shanghai have left Shanghai in succession, leaving only one or two people to preside over everything in Shanghai. When the work of each team is completed, they must return to Shanghai for concentration and then return to Southeast Asia for preparation. It is learned that the group has drafted a declaration regarding the industrial matters to be carried out, which will be announced soon. In addition to the group members being responsible for 20 million yuan in capital, other methods will be used to raise funds. A member of the group said that the number of overseas Chinese is over 20 million, and the average property of each person is at least 200 yuan. If each person contributes five yuan, it will be possible to obtain 100 million. If the domestic compatriots can work together with one mind, after ten or twenty years, the motherland will not be difficult to leap to become the richest country in the world.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau yesterday received a proclamation issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department and immediately posted it for public notice. The proclamation stated: "According to the collection of grain taxes in various counties, this department has learned that there are grain counter clerks privately collecting reduced amounts from taxpayers, without issuing receipts, and promising that they will not be urged to vote every year. Ignorant taxpayers are deceived, seeking convenience, and willingly violating the law without regard. Such collusion between superiors and subordinates is encroaching on public funds. How can this be allowed? This proclamation is hereby issued to all grain counter clerks and taxpayers to be aware. If any of the above fraudulent activities are discovered again, the grain counter clerks, being officials and servants, will be immediately handed over to the judicial authorities for aggravated punishment. Taxpayers will be fined five times the amount they should have paid in previous years, in order to deter and punish, without any leniency. All are to comply. This proclamation is hereby issued."</p>

<p>Qufu County, Shandong Province, is the birthplace of Confucius and the center of Chinese culture. All the ancestral tombs and shrines, as well as the artifacts and ceremonial vessels, are models of the Confucian faith and essential items that must be preserved for eternity. The city walls of Qufu are also very ancient. The city is mostly inhabited by descendants of Confucius. Recently, due to the ravages of war, the temples have been disturbed by artillery fire, the markets have been closed, goods have been damaged, and countless people have been killed by bullets. The Relief Committee previously received urgent appeals from various groups in the county. Chairman Xu of the committee especially published a notice in the newspaper soliciting donations of funds and relief supplies. Yesterday, he also came to Shanghai to personally discuss fundraising methods with Wang Yiting, the resident representative in Shanghai, hoping to raise a large sum within a week and send personnel to distribute it as soon as possible. He deeply hopes that people from all walks of life will consider what is at stake for our country's culture and take responsibility for providing relief, donating generously, to show the people's trend towards the Confucian faith, not just seeing it as saving the general disaster victims of the county.</p>

According to the Ministry of Finance's reply, the reduction and exemption of taxes is related to the national tax quota, and it is being investigated by the Jiangsu Finance Commissioner for review and reply before further review and handling. After receiving the reply, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "It is hereby ordered that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's reply is approved. After investigation and review by this department, the three points made by the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the current difficulties are considered essential and have been handled separately.

<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association's preparatory committee, in light of the soaring prices and precarious livelihood of the common people in this city, and especially considering the crucial importance of the rice price issue, has organized a special committee to study the causes and effects, investigate hoarding, and determine the appropriate measures for relieving the people's food shortage. It held a meeting and appointed Yu Yangsheng as its representative to go to Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the details of his relief rice plan and make all necessary contacts. According to reports, the rice price in Shanghai continues to rise and has not decreased, possibly reaching twenty-four or five yuan. This is of great importance to the people's livelihood. Therefore, the Public Works Department, the Municipal Government, and commercial groups have organized a Rice Market Adjustment Committee, raising funds of one</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>million yuan to purchase Xiang rice for subsidized sale. It is reported that large quantities of Xiang rice are being continuously shipped in. Consequently, the rice speculators, upon learning of this, dare not engage in profiteering, and the price has fallen by three or four yuan. However, rice stores are still secretly raising prices, deceiving buyers, or using inferior rice to pass off as premium rice, engaging in trickery for profit. The committee has become aware of these deceits and hopes that your association will investigate the situation separately. If such fraudulent practices continue to obscure the truth, it is feared that the law will not tolerate it. It is hoped that everyone will make efforts to thoroughly clarify the situation. Furthermore, a good harvest of early rice is expected, which should stabilize the rice price. This is expected to be achieved in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Subsidized Rice Continues to Fall in Price <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Selling Price of 380 Wen Per Sheng</p>
<p>The city's Subsidized Rice Committee, recognizing the drop in rice market prices, has repeatedly lowered the price of subsidized rice to 400 wen per sheng. It is now reported that the committee held its eighth meeting the other day and decided to further reduce the selling price to 380 wen per sheng, effective August 1st. This equates to only 13 yuan per shi. It has been noted that the market price of foreign rice is 14 yuan 67 jiao, while the retail price in rice stores is around 15 yuan, a difference of about 2 yuan per shi. Ordinary people will undoubtedly benefit from this.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Attention Should be Paid to Disinfection Procedures for Cholera Vaccination <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating that the Bureau is promoting free cholera vaccination to protect the health of citizens, increase their resistance to cholera bacteria, and prevent the spread of cholera. The vaccination method is carried out in accordance with the medical procedures, and there is no negligence due to the fact that it is free. Therefore, the personnel sent to carry out the vaccination have considerable knowledge and experience, and the disinfection procedures are already clear. The following procedures must be followed during vaccination: (1) Before the vaccination begins, the syringes and needles must be boiled and sterilized. (2) Used needles should be disinfected in alcohol. (3) The skin on the outside of the upper arm should be wiped with alcohol for disinfection before subcutaneous injection. (4) A new needle should be used for each person vaccinated, and the alcohol in the needle should be removed when attaching the needle. (5) After the vaccination is completed, the instruments should be cleaned, and the needles should be immersed in ether. (6) The number of vaccinated people and the vaccination personnel must fill out an examination form, and the group going to vaccinate must stamp it for verification by the Bureau. The methods are thorough and are supervised and verified at all times. Over the years, more than 1.1 million citizens have benefited from the various vaccinations carried out. It has been found that one or two newspapers have suggested that the health administrative authorities should inform the vaccination personnel to pay attention to disinfection when giving injections. However, the Public Health Department of the International Settlement and the Health Bureau of the French Concession have also been promoting free vaccinations this year. It is not known what the health administrative authorities mentioned by the newspapers refer to, and there is no basis for verification. In addition to informing the vaccination personnel of the Bureau that the above-mentioned disinfection procedures must be strictly followed during vaccination, citizens may report any negligence or failure to disinfect at any time for verification. However, it has been heard that one or two places have disregarded the epidemic prevention of workers and prevented them from being vaccinated, and the health administrative authorities have reprimanded them, or that rumors have been deliberately created to evade responsibility. It is also possible that my citizens are aware that the work of the Bureau is completely based on protecting the health of citizens and preventing the harm of cholera. Although the vaccination is free, the handling is still very cautious. Everyone is encouraged to receive the vaccination actively and not be deceived, so as to prevent the harm of the epidemic. After the vaccination, the injection site may be slightly swollen and uncomfortable due to the action of the vaccine, but it will recover quickly and there is no harm. Please do not misunderstand. This notice.</p>

It is a supreme honor internationally to participate in the various committees. Moreover, at the opening of the conference, Consultant Zhu took the stage to speak about the situation of imperialist countries oppressing Chinese workers and the situation of Japanese yarn factories abusing Chinese workers, which won the sympathy of various countries. His precise and incisive remarks were met with thunderous applause, and everyone was moved. As a result, the Japanese representative even left the meeting.

<p>The city's international radio station, which has been prepared by Wen Yuqing and others sent by the Ministry of Communications, has been under construction for a long time. It is heard that the construction of the radio station building has been completed, and the receiving machinery is relatively simple and has also been installed. However, the generator is quite complicated, and because the wooden bridge near Zhenru has not been repaired, the transportation of the machinery is quite difficult. It is expected that the official communication period will be around October. The machinery is purchased from the United States, Britain, and France, and it will be able to communicate directly with various countries in Europe and America in the future, which will be fast and efficient.</p>
<h3 id="e157">News from the Township Poor People's Loan Office <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>In order to help poor people borrow capital to make a living and solve their livelihood problems, the Municipal Social Bureau established a loan office in Minli Road in Zhabei and Zhonghua Road in the South City last year. Poor people who went to borrow capital were very enthusiastic. With the approval of the Municipal Government, 10,000 yuan was allocated to open offices in various townships. Farmers in various townships have always borrowed money, but they could only mortgage to wealthy households, and the interest rates were very high. Since the establishment of the loan office, agricultural loans can be borrowed for 15 yuan, and poor people can borrow for 10 yuan, with interest rates ranging from 8 to 6 percent (weekly interest). Therefore, the poor farmers have obtained this low-interest loan institution, and they have</p>
<p>submitted requests for loans. Therefore, the total number of loans in Gaoqiao and Yinhang districts has reached the maximum limit, and the loans in other districts such as Wusong, Zhenru, and Luhang have also reached 1,000 yuan. It is heard that farmers in Gaoqiao district are still submitting requests for loans, so they have requested the Bureau to increase the loan amount by 300 yuan. As the district has achieved good results in handling loans, the increase has been approved.</p>

<h3 id="e160">A Telephone Line in the Concession is Out of Service <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Phone Line Was Damaged by Wind and Rain</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, many of the telephone lines of the Shanghai Concession Telephone Company in various districts have been damaged by the continuous strong winds and rain in recent days. In the past few days, about 300 to 400 telephone lines have been out of service, especially in the western district. Some of the telephone users in the western district have not been able to make calls since the last fire. Although the Telephone Company has sent workers to repair them, there are too few workers and many have been missed. Those who send letters to the company must wait many days before receiving a reply. If they send a letter in Chinese, there will never be a reply, which makes communication extremely inconvenient. It is hoped that the company can complete the repairs quickly to facilitate communication.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Taxpayers' Association Again Asks for the Removal of the Garbage Wood Frame <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to Edward, the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating that: "Sir, we have received Mr. Lu Wenzhong's letter dated July 27, which states that he received your association's reply of July 17, which stated that the wooden frame installed at the intersection of X'ian Road and Rue Aude, where garbage is piled, is temporary in nature and that it is not easy to breed flies in a few hours. It can be said that this is the ultimate in perfunctory excuses, and it is even more obvious that you disregard public health and violate the wishes of the citizens. There are restaurants, food shops, theaters, and tea houses near the intersection of X'ian Road and Rue Aude, and it is also a thoroughfare for vehicles and pedestrians. However, now a wooden frame for piling garbage has been installed, which breeds flies and spreads dirt. Is the spread of viruses by flies harmful to health? Anyone with a little common sense will say that the Public Works Department's measures are inappropriate. Therefore, I previously sent a letter to your association to protest to the Public Works Department and urge it to move the frame as soon as possible. Your association is the highest body representing the citizens of the concession, and everyone looks forward to it being able to consider the health and happiness of the citizens. Now it is the hot summer season, and people fear epidemics like tigers. Please protest to the Public Works Department again and remove the garbage wood frame as soon as possible." Considering that the road is lined with shops and is a thoroughfare for vehicles and pedestrians, it is even easier to cause an epidemic if it is not moved in this hot weather. In view of the reasons in the letter, we are writing to you, hoping that you will investigate and handle the matter to emphasize public health and comfort the expectations of the citizens. We still hope to receive a reply so that we can inform you of the situation."</p>
<h3 id="e162">Mitsui's Case is Postponed for Trial <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>After He Gengxing, the compradore of the Japanese Mitsui 洋行, absconded, he owed the company a huge sum of money. The company sued He's guarantor, Hong Cangting, in the Special District Court. At the opening of the trial, Hong's lawyer, Zhang Rongxi, raised the issue of legal person, arguing that Mitsui had not registered with our country's authorities and had not obtained legal person status, so it had no right to sue. The judge in charge instructed the plaintiff to use two remedies: (1) register the 洋行 with our country's government; (2) sue in the name of a natural person. Yesterday morning was another date for the continued trial. In addition to Okamoto, the plaintiff's agent lawyer added Li Zuyu as a lawyer. First, Okamoto presented the revised complaint, stating that the plaintiff had changed to suing in the name of a natural person: Mitsui Morinosuke, a shareholder of Mitsui 洋行, and Fukushima Kishiji, who was elected by the shareholders as the legal representative in this case. If the defendant had no objection to the point of correcting the complaint, please proceed with the trial immediately. Hong's lawyer, Zhang Rongxi, then rose to declare that he admitted that the plaintiff had the ability to sue. The judge in charge then ordered that the case be investigated. Then, Wang Zijian, the lawyer appointed by the court to defend the defendant He Gengxing, stated that after my lawyer was appointed by the court, He's brother, He Xiaobiao, also came to appoint me. Xiaobiao intends to find his younger brother and bring him back to discuss a comprehensive solution with the creditors. The plaintiff's lawyer had previously said that there was hope for reconciliation. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 193 of the Civil Procedure Law, he requested that the trial be postponed. The plaintiff's lawyer expressed his opposition, saying that reconciliation could also be carried out during the trial. Finally, the judge in charge ruled that the case would be postponed for trial. Then, the trial of Mitsui's lawsuit against Yao Weirong, He Gengxing, Hong Cangting, Zhang Chunlai, Zhang Xingchu, etc. of the Yibi Tongsheng Money Shop for not paying 147,429 taels and one qian was continued. The plaintiff's complaint has also been revised, changing the name to Mitsui Morinosuke, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer, Li Zuyu, requested that the court order the liquidator of the shop, Lawyer Hu Yongde, to submit all the account books for preservation, because there were rumors that the shop would destroy evidence. Therefore, he asked that the books be submitted to stop the rumors. However, according to Lawyer Hu, the account books of the shop were sent by its manager, Zhang Chunlai, but there were no shareholder books, so he could not name the shareholders. The judge in charge then asked how many account books there were. Hu said that there were about 48 books. Lawyer Li further stated that if there was no shareholder book during the liquidation, then it would not be possible to know the amount of the share capital. Since the amount of the share capital was not known, how could the liquidation be carried out? This was very strange. Then, the judge in charge ordered Lawyer Hu to submit all the account books within three days. Chen Tingrui, the representative lawyer of the defendant Yao Weirong, stated that the plaintiff's complaint was too simple. What qualifications did he recognize Yao as? Whether he was a shareholder of the shop, or an issuer, or a guarantor, all were not stated. And the origin of the 16 banknotes sued for was also not detailed, only saying "obtained in good faith", which seemed too general and should be stated in detail. The judge in charge then ordered the plaintiff to submit a detailed complaint to the court and wait for the defendants to be served before setting another date for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Mitsui's Registration Issue <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Not Completely Confirmed</p>
<p>Mitsui 洋行's case against He Hong for the price of goods was tried in the Special District Court yesterday. Mitsui 洋行 changed to suing in the names of shareholders Mitsui Yasunosuke and Manager Fukushima Kishiji. After the presiding judge asked Zhang Yaoceng, the defendant's representative lawyer, whether he had any objections, Zhang said that he had no objection to suing in the name of a natural person. After the court adjourned, someone asked Zhang Lawyer why. Zhang said that what I raised last time was the issue of the capacity of a general party. Those who have no capacity to have rights according to law have no capacity to be a party, so a company that is not registered cannot be the plaintiff or defendant. Those who have the capacity to have rights have the capacity to be a party, so all natural persons can be the plaintiff or defendant. This time, Mitsui 洋行 changed to using Mitsui Yasunosuke, etc. as the plaintiff. Since Mitsui Yasunosuke is a natural person, he naturally has the capacity to have rights and cannot be said to have no capacity to be a party according to law. Moreover, it is following the court's judgment and correcting it himself. The reason why I stated that there was no objection was to express that there was no objection to this general capacity to be a party. However, whether Mitsui Yasunosuke is a proper party in the legal relationship in dispute in this case, and whether he has the proper rights, is another issue. In other words, whether Mitsui Yasunosuke has the qualification to litigate in this case, that is, whether he is fit to be a party, is another major issue that must be resolved according to law at the beginning of the debate in this case. I originally intended to raise the defense of lack of fitness of the party immediately after the debate began today, and request the court to make an intermediate judgment first. Unexpectedly, the adjournment was announced without debate, so I had to wait until the next time to raise it. Therefore, whether the legal relationship in this case can be litigated by Mitsui Yasunosuke, etc. is still subject to legal resolution. Outsiders do not understand, or think that there is no problem with the parties in this case, and Mitsui 洋行 does not need to register and can litigate this case by other means. This is to misunderstand the distinction between the capacity to be a party and the fitness of a party, and to make a hasty judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Qiu Guirong Requests an Extension of the Fine Payment Period <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Guirong, a gambler who was involved in a lottery, previously privately established a lottery factory in Wenderi, Rue Lieutenant Bobillot, in the French Concession. This was discovered by a Western detective of the French Concession Police, who went to arrest Qiu and seized lottery evidence. He was sent to the French Court, where he was sentenced to a fine of 1,500 yuan. Because the defendant was unable to raise the money and was detained by the police, he was sent to the court yesterday to request instructions. According to Qiu's confession, he is currently unable to find a way to raise the money and requested that he be given a few days' grace to borrow from relatives and friends. The Chinese and Western officials approved an extension of seven days to raise the money.</p>

<p>Acquittal Ordered</p>
<p>A Russian, Ge Si'ai Lank, yesterday filed a complaint with the French Court, accusing Lu Pingyue Lai Ke, the owner of a certain electric light company, of coming to the merchant's house with his Chinese friend Zhang Zhiqing the other day to dismantle the electric lights. Unexpectedly, he sneaked into the merchant's room and stole gold watches, silver, and other items, and asked for an investigation. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff had instructed the people to go to dismantle the electric lights. Although the plaintiff was not at home at the time, his servant was supervising the dismantling. How could he have stolen anything? The accusation was completely fabricated and requested a clear investigation. He also hired Attorney Pu Mei to defend everything. Judge Zhu ruled that the evidence presented by the plaintiff was insufficient and should be dismissed immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Residents of Hengsha Suffer Tragic Disaster in Hurricane and Giant Waves <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>More than 100 Residents Drowned by Inundating Tide</p>
<p>Houses Collapsed and Belongings Washed Away Without a Trace</p>
<p>The area of Hengsha (belonging to the jurisdiction of Chuansha County), located eighty or ninety miles offshore of the Sanjiashui Estuary of Wusong, faces the sea, surrounded by water on all sides. The terrain is low and the coastline is boundless. The residents of the sandbank have built dikes for protection. The northeast hurricane erupted the day before yesterday, with giant waves reaching the sky and the tide suddenly rising more than ten feet. In the low-lying areas behind the sandbank town, the earthen dikes suddenly collapsed and were washed away. The tide poured in, turning the area into a vast swamp. More than a hundred nearby residents were unable to escape and drowned on the spot. Countless houses collapsed and furniture and belongings were washed away without a trace. Most pitifully, a certain family of seven, including men, women, the old, and the young, all drowned, leaving not even chickens or dogs, a truly tragic event.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Ships Involved in Accidents in the Huangpu River During the Wind and Rain the Night Before Last <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Injured: Sunk Ships: Lost Cargo</p>
<p>The hurricane struck the night before last, becoming more intense in the middle of the night, accompanied by heavy rain. Many cargo ships heavily loaded with goods in the Huangpu River encountered danger. The Tongfeng ship, hired by Hong Yonglin of the Mingguo Road, carrying 200 bales of sesame seeds, was heading to Zhejiang Province. While waiting for the tide to rise for departure, the ship was berthed at Zhoujiadu and was buffeted by the wind and waves, unable to withstand the force. The entire ship capsized, and the crew members fell into the water. Two empty ships berthed nearby heard the shouts for help and rushed to the rescue, rescuing Hong and his crew. However, two other crew members, although not drowned, were seriously injured in the head and back when they collided with iron anchors while escaping to shore. They are currently being treated at the Nanshi Hospital. When the tide receded yesterday, the ship's hull was exposed above the water, leaning to the left. After receiving the report, Tongfeng hired machines to salvage the sunken ship's cargo yesterday. It was reported that the bottom of the ship was damaged by the dredging machine, resulting in significant losses. Furthermore, the Yang Da Zhizhi Pudong ferry ship, loaded with native cloth from Pudong Shengcheng and other companies, was anchored at Lujiahui in the South Huangpu of Pudong the night before last when it was overturned by the wind. The whereabouts of two crew members are currently unknown, presumed to have drowned. Additionally, a Ningbo firewood boat, fully loaded with Hangzhou firewood, capsized in Longhua Bay the night before last due to the wind, resulting in the loss of cargo worth over four thousand yuan. Also, the Shan Heshang Pudong kiln cargo ship, fully loaded with kiln goods, was berthed at the Nanshi Cement Plant pier. During the intense wind, the ship's main mast was blown off and crushed Shan's right arm and the back of a crew member. They were sent to the hospital for treatment. Shan was unharmed and discharged from the hospital on the spot, while his crew member was hospitalized due to severe injuries. It was also reported that a flour boat at the south entrance of Wusong was completely submerged by the wind and waves. Furthermore, many empty ships berthed at the pier had their oars and other equipment blown off by the wind.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Record of the Fire on Manzhou Road, Zhabei <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Fire Spreads to Coal and Kerosene Stacks</p>
<p>At around 3:50 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the Xie Xinxiang coal stack on Manzhou Road near the Guoqing Road intersection in Zhabei. Because the storage consisted of flammable materials, and the wind fueled the fire, the flames quickly spread to the neighboring Dachangsheng stack and six shikumen houses in Chengde Lane (a lane behind). The fire was raging and had not been extinguished for four hours, causing considerable damage. The details obtained from the interview are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of the Fire: The Xie Xinxiang stack, located at 84 Manzhou Road, was established by Ni Qingsheng from Ningbo. It occupies a large area of approximately one mu and has a monthly rent of seventy-seven yuan. It specializes in storing coal and the business is quite good. Currently, there are a large number of coal and kerosene stockpiles belonging to four companies: Ruitai, Hengfeng, Weichang, and Li Xiexing, Ren Wanyou, totaling approximately seven to eight hundred boxes. At 3:45 PM yesterday, a wisp of green smoke suddenly emerged from the Ruitai kerosene stack. At that time, the old clerk was moving goods and was unaware of the fire. After a while, sparks flew and smoke billowed. An old clerk named Shen Laohu saw the scene and was shocked, running into the street and shouting "Fire!" But the fire had already spread beyond control. According to reports, the cause of the fire was a spark entering a box. The oil tanks in the kerosene stack were stacked very high. The muddy ground was damp, and moisture seeped in, causing rust and leaks in the boxes. Ruitai Oil Stack hired workers to repair them by sealing them with tin. During the work yesterday afternoon, a worker accidentally dropped a spark of melted tin into a box. The kerosene caught fire and exploded in an instant. The worker saw the situation was bad and fled immediately, causing a major disaster.</p>
<p>Spread of the Fire: After the fire broke out, the local fire brigade of the fourth district was the first to arrive with their vehicles, dividing up to connect water hoses and pour water to extinguish the fire. Subsequently, the second and third sections and the fire trucks from the concession, Nanshi, East, West, and South Districts, and the Hujia Muqiao area also arrived one after another. However, the materials stored in the stack were all fuels and difficult to extinguish. In an instant, the fire spread to Dachangsheng stack at 95 to 100 on the left side, and the fire became even more intense. The Dachangsheng stack was larger than Xie Xinxiang, and the materials stored there were also coal briquettes, asphalt, and other similar materials. Moreover, the wind was howling and the water supply was lacking, making it difficult to cope. Then, chemical water was sprayed, and the fire was slightly suppressed.</p>
<p>Fire Damage: During the height of the fire, the Public Security Bureau of the fourth district and the Wuzhen Road Police Station dispatched police to the scene to suppress the situation. The owner of Xie Xinxiang was detained for questioning. It was reported that the stack was not insured. The fire burned the Dachangsheng stack and six houses at 6, 12, 18, 19, 20, and 21 Chengde Lane behind the stack. The estimated loss is no less than tens of thousands of yuan.</p>

<p>Columbia Road in Western Shanghai is one of the roads built beyond the boundary. It stretches more than three li from Hongqiao Road in the south to Daxi Road in the north. Xu Yan, the director of the second branch of the sixth district of the local Municipal Public Security Bureau, presented a request to Director Yuan in light of the loss of national sovereignty to establish police stations at Hongqiao Road and Daxi Road. However, at around 11:00 AM on the 28th of this month, the British Public Works Department dispatched many armed Chinese police officers accompanied by fourteen Russians to erect electric poles in the middle section of Columbia Road, Anhe Temple Road (i.e., Fahua Road). Wang Zhentang, a patrol officer from the Daxi Road sub-station, and patrol leader Zhou Yida led police officers on patrol and immediately stepped forward to stop the work. The police officers initially refused to stop, stating that they were acting on orders. Wang explained that the land belonged to the Chinese territory, but the road was built by the Public Works Department beyond the boundary. All construction and administrative powers were under the jurisdiction of the Chinese authorities. As Chinese citizens, they should understand the greater righteousness and immediately stop working, pending serious negotiations between their superiors and the relevant consul. Until a resolution was reached, all work should be stopped, otherwise they would be disarmed and enforcement would be carried out forcibly. The police officers then withdrew. As of yesterday, the Jing'an Temple Police Station dispatched armed double-post Chinese police officers to stand guard in front of the police station at both the north and south ends of Columbia Road, in what seemed like surveillance. Director Xu Yan has reported the situation to Director Yuan, who in turn reported it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arguing based on reason to protect sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Shanghai South Oil Cake Industry's various businesses suffered losses last year due to the insufficient weight and inferior quality of the Dalian cakes sold in various inland ports. The cakes were returned to Shanghai or discounted, causing significant damage to the industry. The association requested a ban and convened a meeting of industry members to discuss countermeasures and establish regulations. However, the weight of the Dalian cakes shipped this year is even lighter than before, and the quality is even worse. The industry discovered this and was preparing to organize a review committee when it coincided with the summer season. At a time when farmland in various rural areas was in need, the demand for soybean cakes in Shanghai was high, with approximately five to six thousand cakes being shipped to various ports every day. However, the weight of the cakes delivered by various ships was reduced, causing great indignation among the industry. A general meeting was convened a few days ago to resolve that if inferior or underweight cakes were found again, the industry would stop picking them up and report to the association to negotiate with the merchants who sold them and pursue compensation for losses. Currently, the association is in negotiations. Recently, the weight of the cakes shipped has continued to be reduced, and the cakes have been sent to the association for negotiation. Yesterday, the various businesses met and decided that Dalian cakes were being shipped to Shanghai for sale under false pretenses, causing damage to the industry. The association has repeatedly negotiated to prevent underweight cakes from being shipped under false pretenses, but the Dalian manufacturers have disregarded their credibility and violated the industry's regulations. Currently, the only option is to stop shipments and pursue compensation for losses, which must be resolved before trading with the merchants again. The association has now warned the Dalian manufacturers.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Record of the Special District Court Burning Narcotics <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>This is the First Time in the Special District</p>
<p>Representatives from All Sectors Participated</p>
<p>The Special District Local Court burned the narcotics such as opium, red pills, and other toxins confiscated in cases from April 1 to June 30 at the Yizhong land of the Tongren Baoan Hall on the south side of the court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. This was the first time this had been done in the concession area. Prior to the event, Court President Yang Zhaoyun sent invitations to various party and government agencies in the local area, as well as the Bar Association and other organizations, inviting them to send representatives to the site to supervise, in order to show prudence. After 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the court ordered workers to construct a long reed mat shed in the center of the Yizhong land, with a long table inside, more than twenty seats and teaware. The site for the burning was about two zhang away from the shed and was circular, with lush green grass that had been mowed and paved with bricks. At 10:30 AM, everything was ready. Court President Yang and Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue led their subordinates to the site, and Xu Weizhen, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, also led several prosecutors from the court to the site to supervise. Soon, representatives from various agencies arrived one after another. The Public Works Department also sent legal advisors Mr. Bolang and Mr. Gan Jingxian to visit. They were all received by Court President Yang and Chief Prosecutor Zhou and invited to take their seats. President Xu, dressed in Western attire, sat in the center, and the other guests sat in order. Court police officers were present to maintain order, and outside the site, special Chinese and Western police officers and Indian mounted patrols were dispatched by the local police station to patrol the perimeter wall of the Yizhong land. Initially, some people perched on the top of the wall to watch, but the patrolling police officers, considering it obstructive to order, persuaded them to leave one by one. Four guards were stationed at the entrance of the site, and all those entering were questioned. In total, no less than thirty or forty Chinese and Western individuals and reporters attended to observe. When the burning order was issued, Prosecutor Guo Huaipu and Secretary Ge Sixun first checked the opium paste, opium equipment, red pills, and other narcotics package by package. Any larger packages were opened and inspected in public, and then cut open with knives by the workers. Then, they were moved to the burning site. After the firewood was ignited and the flames were raging, the narcotics were thrown into the fire, and salt was shoveled into the fire, followed by kerosene, which further intensified the flames. At this time, many of those who came to take photos were engaged in photographic work. From 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, the valuable narcotics were completely reduced to ashes. The supervisors and observers then departed.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenqing's Testimony Changes</p>
<p>Chen Hengcai Appeals for Death</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, in collusion with Chen Hengcai, the son of a servant, gathered Yao Shuigui and Gao Jintang and murdered his stepmother Zhang Su on the premises of 742 Carter Road in January of this year. After the police arrested and interrogated the perpetrators, a verdict was reached after more than a dozen interrogations, and each of the perpetrators was sentenced to death. The convicts were not willing to accept this and hired lawyers to file an appeal. At 8:30 AM yesterday morning, Song Yuan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and two judges, Ye Du, opened the court to summon witnesses and order Zhang and the other three to be brought to the case. Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan also attended the court to perform his duties. First, the appellant Zhang Wenqing was interrogated. According to his statement, the deceased stepmother Su was close to being romantic in her everyday behavior, frequently going out and not returning home at night. Chen Hengcai came to my house last winter and told me that he had already arranged for two people to stab Su, because his mother had originally worked as a servant in my house but had been fired by Su. When I heard Chen's remarks, I stopped him for fear of being framed. Judge Song instructed him, "From what you have said, it is clear that you have a special relationship with Chen, otherwise Chen would not have revealed this secret, and if you had no relationship, you would have reported him." Zhang insisted that he had nothing to do with Chen, and said that Chen might have some involvement with Su, because Chen went to Su's room every morning, and apart from Su and her two children, there was no one else in the room. Chen stayed in the room for one or two hours before coming out. Judge Song further instructed him, "Your statement is inconsistent with the previous one, and the meaning of today's words is to protect Chen and cover up your own guilt. In fact, this kind of testimony is of no benefit to you. You should be frank, because what can be determined in this case is the fact that you instigated the crime, but the relationship between you and Chen, the relationship between you and Su, and the relationship between Su and Chen, have not been clarified." Zhang replied that he had no relationship with them, but Chen went to Su's room in the morning. Then the court ordered the bailiff to bring Chen Hengcai to the court from the waiting room. According to Chen's statement, the murder of Su was entirely done by me. Zhang, Yao, and Gao had nothing to do with it and were innocent. I beg that the three men be released and that I be allowed to pay for my crimes. Please execute me quickly. The court instructed him, "The purpose of your appeal is to reduce the sentence of the first trial, but now you want to be sentenced to death, which is not the purpose of the appeal." Chen replied that this was what I wanted to do, so I appealed. In short, Su was actually stabbed by me. After being arrested, I also falsely accused Zhang Wenqing because Zhang Wenqing slandered me. Then Yao Yonggui was brought in for questioning. He stated that he had been implicated. Chen Hengcai had asked him to go to Zhang's house, saying it was for fun, and did not mention murder. When I arrived, Zhang Wenqing was by the handrail. I followed Chen and Gao into the house. Zhang's lawyer Jiang Rong asked Yao, "What did Zhang do when he was by the handrail?" Yao replied that he did not pay attention. Gao Jintang was also questioned, and Gao completely denied participating in the murder. Zhang Jinbao and Yinbao, the two sons of the deceased, testified that when their mother was murdered, they were in the lane. When they returned home, Gao Yonggui opened the door, and Zhang Wenqing was also going upstairs. The court then questioned Zhang Wenqing and Chen Hengcai whether they had opened the door when they entered the house. Zhang denied it. The court then instructed Zhang Wenqing and the others to be returned to custody separately and scheduled to begin the debate this morning.</p>

<p>Mute Husband Watches Wife Die</p>
<p>Old Father Speaks Up for Daughter</p>
<p>Shi Changhe, a boatman from Yancheng, Jiangbei, berthed his boat at Xiaoshadu. He had a son named Shi Hongcai, who was thirty-six years old and mute. He married Wang Rugang's daughter from the same village and industry. Wang was thirty-four years old this year and had a daughter named Fengying, who was twelve years old this year. However, Shi Changhe had a violent temper, so Shi Wang was often abused. On the thirteenth of this month, Shi Wang became thirsty and asked her daughter to bring tea. The daughter did not obey, and Shi Wang angrily beat her. Unexpectedly, this angered Shi Changhe, who tied up Wang and beat her with a stick, causing her head to bleed. Shi died on the seventeenth. Her husband, Shi Hongcai, saw his wife being beaten to death by his father, but because he was mute, he could not speak. So he hastily collected her body and temporarily housed it in the Jiangbei Guild Hall. Yesterday, Wang Rugang came to Shanghai by boat and went to Xiaoshadu to see his daughter. He saw that his granddaughter Shi Fengying was dressed in mourning. He was shocked and asked her what had happened. Fengying told him everything. Wang was furious and immediately took Shi Changhe to the Sixth District Police Station, who transferred him to the Local Court. He was ordered to be detained pending the opening of the coffin for an inquest.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Death by Unwanted Marriage <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Sailing into the River, Life Given to the Current</p>
<p>Several Suicide Notes Comfort Family Members</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a young man in Western attire committed suicide by jumping into the river from a sampan. He could not be rescued and died in the river. He left behind farewell letters to his parents, older brother, and sister-in-law, as well as other miscellaneous items. The reason was dissatisfaction with his marriage. The detailed circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>The brothers both work in the tailoring business. Su Adi, from Pudong, has been working as a ferryman on the Lujiazui ferry in Pudong. His wife lives at home and farms. They have two sons. The elder son, named Zhanglong, and his wife run a Western-style tailoring shop at 28 Bow-machi, Hongo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. The business is quite prosperous. The younger son, named Lufu, is 22 years old and also a Western-style tailor. He was married in December of last year. Lufu considered this marriage not of his own free will, thus planting the seeds of suicide.</p>
<p>The Newlyweds are Like Strangers. Lufu was young and handsome. Apart from working hours, he always wore elegant Western suits when going out. He was a man of refined manners and had absorbed new knowledge. He strongly advocated absolute freedom in marriage. However, his parents were stubborn and believed that their son's marriage was a matter of obedience to their commands. Last year, they arranged a marriage through a matchmaker with a woman surnamed Mou to be his wife. The wedding was scheduled for December. Lufu, who was working with his brother in Japan, returned home upon hearing the news and strongly opposed this marriage, which was not approved by him, before his parents. However, he could not defy their strict orders and reluctantly married. However, the newlyweds were like strangers. As soon as the New Year holiday was over, Lufu left for Japan and did not return for a long time. His wife had no choice but to weep in secret.</p>
<p>Jumping into the River Mid-Stream. After Lufu arrived in Japan, he continued to work at his brother's shop for more than two months. Then, he made an excuse to return to China and rented a place at 390 Ruixing Lane, Weihaiwei Road, in the British Concession. The house was a Western-style tailoring shop, and Lufu worked there. Although his family was near in Pudong, he did not visit. He only informed his parents that he had come to Shanghai and stated his address. From then on, the thought of suicide suddenly arose. According to his suicide note, he once attempted suicide by taking opium at an inn in Changzhou, but failed. Yesterday morning, at around 7 a.m., he went out alone, wearing a gray serge Western suit, in Shanghai. He walked to the Bund pier on Jiujiang Road, hired sampan number 920, and said he wanted to cross the river. When he reached the middle of the river, he placed a straw hat, a small silver coin, two silver dimes, a suicide note (containing farewell letters to his parents and older brother and sister-in-law), and a blank piece of paper in the cabin. He then jumped into the river and immediately sank without a trace. The sampan boatman, Zheng Acai, tried to save him but failed. He then sent the belongings to the water police station for handling.</p>
<p>The Stubborn Father Weeps with Unavailing Regret. The police station received the report and examined the letter. It was addressed to his brother in Japan. In addition to the letters to his parents, older brother, and sister-in-law, it also stated the Shanghai address as 390 Ruixing Lane, Weihaiwei Road, in the British Concession. There was also a note that read: "Please do not report this to my family. Please ask a charitable organization to collect my body," twelve characters in total. The detective chief immediately ordered Chinese detective Huang Songsheng to investigate the address. The landlord stated that his father, Su Adi, was a ferryman in Pudong and volunteered to summon Su to the location. The detective then questioned Su in detail. As soon as Su heard that his son had committed suicide, he burst into tears. He told the detective in detail how the deceased had opposed the marriage and concluded by saying that he never expected him to commit suicide. The detective then ordered Su to go to the police station to explain the situation. The detective chief instructed him to take the belongings with him and to notify him when the body was recovered for collection.</p>
<p>The Suicide Note. The suicide note consisted of six pages in total: three pages addressed to his parents and three pages addressed to his older brother and sister-in-law. They were enclosed in an envelope. The letter addressed to his parents is copied below: (Dear Parents, Your unfilial son is no longer in this world. I will repay your kindness in raising me as a dog or horse in the next life. I hope a charitable organization will collect my body. Please do not grieve for me. I regret that I took six cents worth of opium at an inn in Changzhou and lay there for thirty hours, but I did not die. If I had died then, I would have had some money to pay for a coffin and clothes. For a month, I spent money like water on beer, soda, and ice cream. I knew I should not have done that, but it was my last pleasure. I suppose I have enjoyed all the pleasures of the world, so I feel it is meaningless. Therefore, I have no choice but to commit suicide. I hope that after I am gone, you will not grieve for me. Please forgive me for seeking peace in the underworld. Otherwise, would it not increase my sins? I will tell you the rest in my dreams. I respectfully wish you both good health and hope you take care of yourselves and eat well. Your sinful son, Lufu, bows a hundred times. July 29.)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Contents of the Suicide Note. The letter to his older brother and sister-in-law reads as follows: (Brother, I have committed suicide. After I am gone, please do not think of me. The reason for my death is marriage. I die without regret. However, there is no one to collect my body. What should I do? I suppose I have committed many sins and deserve this fate. I hope you will take good care of our parents. Your brother, Lufu, bows. There are three more pages. Please convey them to our parents when you return to China. It would be best if you return to Shanghai as soon as you receive this letter. If our parents are sad, please comfort them. Farewell to my dear brother, sister-in-law, brothers, and sisters. Please do not think of me. I will close my eyes in the underworld.)</p>
<h3 id="e178">Item: Wu Deceives a Widow for Profit <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Both Men and Women are Sold</p>
<p>Meeting on a Narrow Path, They are Sent to the Authorities</p>
<p>Shen Fu, a woman from Pinghu, is 44 years old. She used to farm in her hometown for a living. After her husband died, she had no one to rely on. She came to Shanghai by boat in April of this year and stayed at her older sister's house at 92 Tiandeng Lane, inside the Datong Gate. She then went to a matchmaking shop run by Wu in Sanpailou, asking to be introduced as a maid. Because she could not find an employer for a while, she often waited at the shop for a good opportunity. One day, she happened to meet Xiang Wu, a woman from Songjiang, who was 51 years old. They got along well after chatting. Wu, thinking that the woman was naive and easily deceived, told her that a family in Songjiang wanted to hire a maid. They needed someone honest and reliable, and the monthly salary would be eight yuan. The woman believed her and was willing to go to Songjiang with her. After arriving in Songjiang, Xiang Wu led her to Chen Futang's house. The woman thought that Chen was the employer, so she stayed there. Later, she realized that something was wrong, so she asked Chen for the reason. Chen told her the truth, saying that he was 36 years old. He had been farming too much and had not yet married because his family was poor. Xiang Wu came here and said that she knew a woman, referring to you, who had no one to rely on after her husband died and wanted to find a suitable person to spend the rest of her life with. She said that if the woman was willing, she only needed to pay sixty yuan to make it happen. He was happy to hear that and obtained sixty yuan from outside. After giving the money, he brought you here. In reality, you are my wife. The woman was shocked to hear this. She knew that she had been deceived by Wu, but what was done could not be undone. She had no choice but to go along with it. After a month, she saw that Chen's family was poor. She also saw that Chen was violent and would scold and beat her. She felt that life was unbearable and difficult to stay. So, she secretly escaped the other day and took a car to Shanghai. She still stayed at her sister's house. Yesterday afternoon, at around 2 p.m., the woman happened to meet Xiang Wu on the road near the Tasi Bridge. Because she had suffered so much after being deceived, she could not let it go. As soon as she saw Wu, she grabbed her and called out to Yan Likui, the guard at the sixth post there. She was taken back to the third section of the first district. After preliminary interrogation by Chief Jin, he found that Xiang Wu's behavior was cunning and that she dared to lure and sell rural women. It was extremely abhorrent. He ordered her to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Qu vs. Zhou Grave Dispute: Lawyers Testify <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The case of Qu Shen, a local woman, and her son Qu Shunxiang, disputing the ancestral grave with Zhou Jianren, was publicly heard by Criminal Judge Shen Bingrong in the local court some days ago. It remained unresolved, with the judge ordering further hearings with witnesses. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Judge Shen opened the First Court again for questioning. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Kuitang, and the defendant's lawyer, Ye Fulou, arrived in court one after another. The witnesses for both parties, lawyers Wang Chengkuan and Gu Yongquan, attacked each other in court. The details of the questioning are recorded below. After Judge Shen took the stand, he ordered the witness Su Zuoxian to the case. Su testified, "The draft contract was signed on March 27th, and the settlement agreement was made at the Dafugui Restaurant on May 4th. Zhou Jianren was out for business and appointed me as his representative." (Question) "Did Zhou Jianren hire lawyer Gu Yongquan?" (Answer) "Yes, he did. The other party hired lawyer Wang Chengkuan." (Question) "Were you fully authorized?" (Answer) "Yes, I was fully authorized. At that time, the local guarantor Yu Bingchen said that the Qu family had a lot of evidence. Zhou Jianren instructed me to deal with it carefully. Zhou's intention was to pay at most two or three thousand yuan. When the time came, they wanted six thousand two hundred yuan. Because Yu said that there was a lot of evidence, I agreed." (Question) "How many deeds were there at that time?" (Answer) "Yu Bingchen took out two blank deeds from his side. Then I wrote a note for six thousand two hundred yuan. After it was written, Yu took it away. But before that, Yu Bingchen said that there was a 'fang dan' (square receipt), several 'jue qi' (absolute deeds), and eight years of grain strings. I didn't expect that only two blank deeds would be used when making the agreement." (Question) "Did both lawyers witness this?" (Answer) "Both witnessing lawyers, Wang Chengkuan and Gu Yongquan, saw it." (Question) "Were Zhao Qiming, Zhang Shousan, Yu Bingchen, and others present?" (Answer) "They were all present. There was also an old woman (i.e., Qu Shen)." The witness Gu Yongquan testified, "I am currently a lawyer." (Question) "Were you present for the Qu and Zhou families' land dispute?" (Answer) "I was present." (Question) "How many deeds did the Qu family hand over at that time?" (Answer) "Only two blank deeds. After Su Zuoxian wrote the note, the two blank deeds were taken out of Yu Bingchen's pocket." The witness Liu Guisheng testified, "I run a customs brokerage in Yongji Lane, Jiangxi Road." (Question) "Does Qu Shunxiang have land mortgaged to you?" (Answer) "No, Qu Shunxiang mortgaged the land from the thirtieth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty through Qu Shunxiang's father, Qu Xianglin, to my father for three hundred yuan. On April 30th of this year, Qu Xianglin's wife, Qu Shen, came with Zhao Qiming (i.e., Cao Qiming) and others to redeem it for seven hundred yuan." (Question) "How many deeds were there?" (Answer) "Five 'shang shou qi' (first-hand deeds), one 'fang dan' (square receipt), and one mortgage deed, a total of seven deeds." (Question) "Was it Lot 189 of Tanzizhen?" (Answer) "Yes, it was redeemed in my shop." Lawyer Wang Chengkuan testified, "I am a lawyer." (Question) "Did you go to Dafugui on May 4th?" (Answer) "I went. Qu Shen came to entrust me beforehand. By the time we got to Dafugui, they had already negotiated. I drafted the settlement agreement, and Su Zuoxian wrote the note. After the settlement agreement was written, Qu Shen handed over one 'fang dan' (square receipt) and five deeds to Zhao Qiming, who handed them over to me. I then handed them over to the other party's lawyer, Gu Yongquan. Yu Bingchen was overseeing on the side." (Question) "Is this all true?" (Answer) "It is true. How can a lawyer lie?" The interrogator said, "Your testimony is completely inconsistent with Gu Yongquan's testimony. But you are a lawyer, and Gu is also a lawyer. Which one is false and which one is true?" At this point, Gu Yongquan repeatedly said, "Lawyer Wang is too unethical, a disgrace to lawyers!" Judge Shen quickly stopped him, saying, "You are also a lawyer, how can you insult him in court?" Judge Shen asked Wang again, "Why did you only write 'all documents' on the settlement agreement and not specify the types?" (Answer) "This is how Gu Yongquan instructed me to write it, because everything had already been negotiated." Judge Shen then asked Gu Yongquan when the deed was signed. Gu answered, "The deed was signed on May 26th. The owner is Lu Youyuan." Lawyer Wang Chengkuan said, "At 11 a.m. on May 26th, Gu Yongquan and Su Zuoxian came to my office and said to me, 'We are signing the deed today. They want to embezzle the six thousand two hundred yuan that should be paid to the Qu family completely and offered me two thousand yuan, with the rest to be split between them.' I didn't think that was right and expressed my opposition. After Gu left, he came again and told me that the Qu family's money had not been paid. I thought that because the parties were not familiar with the law, they hired a lawyer to testify to ensure legal protection. But in this case, even with a lawyer's testimony, there are more complications. I really didn't expect it!" Judge Shen asked Gu Yongquan again, "Did you and Su go to lawyer Wang's office on May 26th?" (Answer) "I didn't go. I went to Lu Youyuan's house at 10 a.m. and left at 12:45 p.m. At that time, Yu Bingchen wanted to transfer six thousand two hundred yuan to Lu, but Lu refused, saying that the money should be paid directly from the Zhou family to the Qu family." The witness Zhao Qiming testified, "There were indeed six deeds, which were transferred to lawyer Gu." Qu Shunxiang testified, "I had not arrived in Shanghai on May 4th, so my mother Qu Shen went to Dafugui." (Question) "Why is Qu Shen not here today?" (Answer) "She has diarrhea and cannot come to court." (Question) "When did you arrive in Shanghai?" (Answer) "May 10th." At this point, the redeemed mortgage deed was presented to the court. After Judge Shen examined it, he ordered Zhou Jianren to the case and testified, "I didn't go to Dafugui on May 4th because of class. I asked Su Zuoxian to represent me. I only found out later that I was deceived." He also requested the judge to summon the grave keeper Zhao Jinyuan for testimony. Judge Shen then said to both lawyers, "We will not hold arguments today. We will continue to hear witnesses and schedule another hearing." Then he adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Losing His Son and Injuring His Son-in-Law</p>
<p>Zhang Amu, from Ningbo, is currently in his forties and works at the Xie Da Game Shop on Caishi Street in the French Concession. His first wife died early, leaving behind a son and a daughter. He remarried a woman surnamed Mou, and they live together on the third floor of the Ruifengxiang New Clothes Shop opened by the Xiaoningbo family across from Xie Da. His daughter has already married. His son, Hongfa, is currently sixteen years old and is apprenticing at a customs brokerage. The other day, Hongfa had nothing to do at the brokerage and was playing chess with another apprentice. The weather was hot, and they were sweating profusely. The other apprentice (who is ten years old) suggested that Hongfa go to the Huangpu Bund to cool off. At that time, the hot sun had not yet abated. Hongfa wanted the other apprentice to take a cold bath with him. The apprentice was young and timid and hesitated. Hongfa took off his clothes and asked the apprentice to take them. Then he jumped into the Huangpu River. At that time, the tide was high, and the waves were surging. After Hongfa entered the water, he did not surface again and joined the water ghosts. The apprentice waited on the Bund for two or three hours but still did not see Hongfa come ashore. The apprentice had no choice but to take the clothes back to the brokerage and inform the manager, who in turn informed Hongfa's father, Zhang Amu. After receiving the news, he sent someone to inform his son-in-law, planning to go to the Huangpu Bund with him to find his son's body. His son-in-law received the message and immediately left home (near Xiaodongmen). He was attacked by enemies with knives and stabbed several times, fell injured to the ground, and was taken by family members by car to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Zhang's situation can be described as misfortunes never come singly. Currently, his son Hongfa's body has floated up at the Beijing Road Pier and is being prepared for burial. His son-in-law's injuries are not fatal, and his life is not in danger.</p>

They went to search the house the other day and confiscated two boxes of opium worth 7,000 yuan, weighing 130 pounds. They took the smuggler Chen Qichang into the police station together. Yesterday, he was taken to the French Concession court for questioning. The Western Detective Chief first reported the situation and presented the opium for inspection. Chen Qichang confessed to smuggling opium. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Chen to a fine of 3,500 yuan to be confiscated as a warning, and the opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Bribery Attempt by Detectives Rejected <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>All Appeals Dismissed</p>
<p>Cao Jie, a detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and detectives Xu Wenzhong and Chen Bingsheng, were exposed by the police station for accepting bribes from Hu Changbao. Zheng Zhi, who acted as a bribe-giver on behalf of Hu, was also charged at the same time. After the judgment by the Special District Local Court, Cao, Xu, and Chen were each sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment and a fine of 500 yuan. Zheng Zhi was sentenced to two months. Cao, Xu, and Chen were dissatisfied and appealed. The police station also filed an appeal because Zheng Zhi's sentence was too light. The Higher Branch Court reviewed the proposals separately, and after the conclusion of the investigation, Judge Song and Judge Ye, ascended the bench to announce the verdict yesterday morning. Both appeals were dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Qian Huafo's Buddhist Painting Lawsuit <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>A Friend Sues Him for Degeneration</p>
<p>A Calligrapher Claims to Have Bought It Last Year</p>
<p>Qian Huafo is famous at the time for his good at drawing Buddhist images. In the past, he was good at drama, but in recent years, Qian abandoned the stage life of an actor and became a painter. Zhou Wuming, a Ningbo native and manager of the Yichun Hall fan shop at Paoxiu field on Nanjing Road, allegedly imitated Qian's seal on a Buddhist image painted by someone else and printed it on the image, which infringed on copyright. Qian filed a criminal suit against Zhou for privately making a seal and filed a civil suit to recover losses. Judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Special District Local Court summoned him for trial yesterday morning. According to Qian's confession, he did not know that the defendant had done this. This spring, when he talked about painting with a friend, the friend said that the brushwork of the Buddha he painted was suddenly becoming more and more degenerated, and advised him to abandon this business and seek another livelihood. I asked him what he saw and said that the Buddha statue I saw hanging in Yichun Hall had dull brushwork, how could it be easily sold for money? In March, I asked a friend to buy a Buddha statue from the hall for a price of 22 yuan. Upon closer inspection, I realized that this painting was not my handwriting, it was impersonating my name, a forged seal. So he presented one of the Buddhas he painted to the court, requesting verification. According to the defendant's confession, the Buddha sold to the plaintiff was consigned by a Shen family member, and I only sold it on consignment. I have never been responsible for its authenticity. Shen is also present today. So, according to Shen Youren's confession, the painting was indeed entrusted to the defendant for consignment. I have made a living selling books, and the painting was bought last year for twelve yuan, not painted by myself. When I bought it, I thought it was Huafo's brush, so I wrote a poem on the painting and asked the defendant to sell it on consignment, but I didn't know it was a counterfeit. Judge Cheng ordered a retrial in seven days and sent a bailiff to the defendant's Paichun Hall to retrieve the business books for verification.</p>

<p>A Total of Seventy-Four Packets of Opium</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 11:30 a.m., a short-haired woman, wearing a cheongsam and leather shoes, quite fashionable, and carrying a leather bag, looking like a female staff member serving in an agency, was lingering at the Wusong Town Station. Yang Maorong, the seventh district chief of public security, noticed that the woman's behavior was suspicious. He sent detectives Yu Peifa and Ling Zifa to investigate. They saw the woman leave the station in a panic. They stopped her for questioning, but she was evasive. They found a total of seventy-four packets of opium of various sizes in the leather bag. They took the woman to the district. After questioning by District Chief Yang, she confessed that her name was Wang Shengying, 23 years old, from Wusong, and currently works at the Haining Road Telephone Company in Shanghai. The leather bag was entrusted to her by her acquaintance Li Genbao to take to Song, and she didn't know that it contained opium. When he ordered an investigation into Li Genbao, there was no such person. Obviously, the woman was minimizing her responsibility. District Chief Yang, because the case was related to smuggling opium, ordered the suspect to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau along with the opium for questioning.</p>

<p>Gong Zhenyi, a 31-year-old resident of the Aiwun Hotel at 35 Aiwun Road, was a rice merchant. Due to economic pressure, he committed suicide by taking raw opium yesterday morning. Around 1 p.m., a waiter discovered him and reported it to the bookkeeper, who reported it to the Xinzha Road Police Station. Bao detective number 196 was immediately dispatched to investigate. When he arrived at the hotel, he had not yet died, so he was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. But he was too poisoned, and the treatment was ineffective. He died at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, around 11:30 a.m., in the Di Yi Lou teahouse in the Jiumu area of the city, three or four tea guests wearing short clothes were sitting at a table, sipping tea. They were happily chatting when one of them, a man wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, suddenly became ill, bowed his head on the table, and remained silent. In a moment, his face was pale, his eyes were dull, and his limbs were cold. His companions were trying to send him to the hospital for treatment when he suddenly died. The deceased was still sitting on the chair, with his head resting on the back of the chair. For a time, the residents nearby gathered to watch, and everyone was amazed. It is said that the deceased was from Ningbo, came from Zhabei, and was planning to return to Ningbo on a boat in the afternoon. He was about forty years old. The teahouse owner reported it to the police district in charge.</p>

It is also said that colleagues in the bureau, seeing that Ling's family was poor and left behind a wife and children, were planning to raise money for donations.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing regarding the item in your newspaper's local news column on July 27 concerning the statistics of patients at the Red Cross Epidemic Hospital, which stated that one percent of patients had genuine cholera. This is inconsistent with the facts. Since our hospital opened on the 10th of this month, although we have treated more than five hundred people, we have never encountered anyone with genuine cholera. However, it is true that one percent of patients received physiological saline infusions, which may have led to the misunderstanding. We request that your newspaper correct this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross</p>
<p>July 30th</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing regarding the item on page four of your newspaper on July 29 which stated that Platoon Leader Bu Yunzhou of the First Regiment of the Guard Brigade went to the Longhua Command Headquarters on official business, and that the accompanying military police found that the soldiers accompanying the platoon leader were carrying a bomb, which they threw but did not explode, causing the passengers on the vehicle to be greatly alarmed. Our regiment has checked the roster thoroughly and there is no person named Platoon Leader Bu Yunzhou. Furthermore, no one has been sent to the Longhua Command Headquarters on official business recently. We suspect that the report is inaccurate. We have dispatched investigators to ascertain the truth, and we are sending this letter specifically for correction. We hope that you will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Headquarters, First Regiment, Guard Brigade, National Government</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read the item in your newspaper's local news column on July 30 concerning the judgment in the case of Yongji Heng Salt Company of Yangzhou owing a large sum of more than 500,000 yuan to the China Industrial Bank in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, and to various private banks such as Jiuyu. The general practice in ranking creditors is to prioritize them according to the amount owed, with the largest debts coming first. However, the amount owed to our bank by Yongji Heng is only 10,000 taels, which is a small amount in the total debt, and should not be listed first. We suspect that this is a factual error and request that it be corrected.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai China Industrial Bank</p>
<p>July 30th</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Zhou Zishan and others came to our office and stated that they had read a news item in your newspaper's local news column on July 30 about the judgment of the Yongji Heng Salt Company debt repayment case, which contained inaccuracies. The most important of these is that Yongji Heng was established as a sole proprietorship by Zhou Weibin, and was not established by their ancestor Zhou Fuju under the name Zhou Wuchang. The report in your newspaper stated that the deceased salt merchant Zhou Fuju formerly opened the Yongji Heng Salt Company in Yangzhou under the name Zhou Wuchang Hall, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. These inaccuracies have a great impact on this case. They have specifically requested your lawyer to send a letter to your newspaper to request a correction. Based on this, we are writing to request that your newspaper investigate and correct the matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e196">Sociological Miscellany, Issue 2, Edited by Yang Qi Yun <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Edited by the Southeast Sociological Society</p>
<p>Published by World Book Company</p>
<p>The second issue of "Sociological Miscellany" contains nine treatises: (1) Two Classifications of Social Action, (2) Sociology and Economics, (3) Research on Rural Social Surveys, (4) A Theory of Sociological Systems, (5) On the Content of Sociology and a Response to Mr. Peng Jixiang, (6) Labor Legislation in China, (7) Culture and Eugenics, (8) Eugenics and Culture, (9) Further Discussion on Culture and Eugenics. A summary introduction is given below:</p>
<p>Two Classifications of Social Action</p>
<p>Society is already complex enough. To study its actions within this complexity, one must analyze and categorize them in detail. The author of this article, Xu Shilian, uses an objective approach, emphasizing the social nature, to propose a classification of actions, demonstrating a path for scholars to study social actions. At the same time, he introduces Professor Hayes' subjective analysis, which emphasizes individual psychology, as a classification of social actions.</p>
<p>From a sociological perspective, any classification has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, subjective classifications, focusing on the internal, tend to have more flaws. Therefore, the author "does not consider civil analysis to be perfect," because psychological analysis lacks actions related to group self-preservation and group perpetuation.</p>
<p>Naturally, the noteworthy aspect of this article lies in the author's objective analysis, which has its own unique insights.</p>
<p>Sociology and Economics</p>
<p>The author is one of China's leading socio-economists, particularly skilled in the study of economic thought. This is mentioned in the editor's preface to this issue. Therefore, the author reveals the original face of an economist. He affirmatively states that economics is an independent science and is not a part of sociology.</p>
<p>The full text is divided into four layers: (1) Is sociology a part of economics, or is economics a part of sociology? (2) Similarities between sociology and economics, (3) What sociological subjects should be studied when studying economics? (4) What economic subjects should be studied when studying sociology?</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the author begins by saying, "Sociology and economics are both independent sciences, each with its own focus, and each does not hinder the other." From this statement, many proofs are derived, explaining the erroneous arguments of previous scholars, and stating the reasons why economics has become a science. He says that economics studies the relationship between people and wealth, extracting facts and theories related to economics from social sciences to make it a science. The second part discusses "The similarities between sociology and economics." The author tells us there are three points: (1) The greatest similarity between sociology and economics is that both are sciences that study the relationship between people; (2) In terms of methods, the two subjects use the same methods. The methods of deduction and induction are indispensable; (3) Sociology and economics have close relationships with other sciences. In other words, due to the similarity of their content and nature, sciences that are very important to sociologists are also of equal importance to economists. In addition, the last two layers of this article can be said to be where the value of the article lies, showing students the way to study and helping them choose courses.</p>
<p>Research on Rural Social Surveys</p>
<p>China has never seen systematic surveys and accurate statistics on any matter. When studying many social problems in recent times, one often only uses foreign survey research materials to prove the evidence of a certain social problem in China. Isn't this a ridiculous joke that involves cutting wood to fit shoes, and forced analogies? The author of this article recognizes this point. He says, "China has always lacked systematic and organized research in the area of social surveys, especially in the area of rural society. Apart from a few poems by literati and scholars, a few notes by philosophers, or occasional descriptions of the social situation at the time, there is no so-called social survey. Although there are some fragmentary articles now, very few are accurate and in accordance with the principles of survey." At the same time, we know that our China is an agricultural country. If we want to improve the countryside, revitalize agriculture, we must first know what should be reformed and what should be promoted. Therefore, we have no choice but to start with surveys.</p>
<p>This article focuses on discussing the methods of rural social surveys. The author uses scientific methods and, based on rural social phenomena, sets out the procedures and methods of investigation. At the same time, he analyzes the types of rural social surveys into a precise outline, and at the end, he also attaches fourteen types of forms for surveying rural society, which are drafted according to the conditions of Chinese rural society. It can be said to be a very valuable work.</p>
<p>A Theory of Sociological Systems</p>
<p>Sociologists have never had a consistent view on sociological theories. Naturally, everyone has their own system. The author of this article first describes the general classifications, including those of Ward, Endo Ryukichi, Shinmei Seido, and other sociological system classifications. In the final section, he writes out "Our Classification of Sociological Systems." The author believes that Comte's efforts in the history of modern sociology have resulted in two main sociological systems: (1) comprehensive sociological systems and (2) sociological systems of special social sciences.</p>
<p>The entire text can be said to be of an introductory nature. As the editor's preface says, "The collection is very rich, and the views are especially appropriate." I naturally also admit the first point, but the second sentence "The views are especially appropriate" is contrary to my observation. I feel that this article seems to lack some insights and does not explain the gains and losses of each "classification of systems."</p>
<p>Labor Legislation in China</p>
<p>Although my country's industry is still very immature, the labor disputes in our major cities are already quite considerable. If we want to reduce labor disputes and increase work efficiency, we naturally need complete labor laws. The author of this article, Zhu Jun, has collected all the labor laws and regulations in China's history to make a systematic analysis and critique. In the draft factory law proposed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the section on surplus distribution is very noteworthy. Even the Chinese Economic Society held a research conference at Nanjing Central University to discuss it. The author's opinion is that "According to this kind of suspension question, it is extremely relevant to China's industry. It cannot be promulgated rashly without detailed research from both theoretical and factual aspects. Because China's industry is being destroyed by imperialism, it is always in a precarious situation. The development of industry should be promoted as much as possible, so that unemployed workers can find work."</p>
<p>The last part of this article is where the author's views are most appropriate. He says that there are two key points in compiling labor laws: (1) When compiling labor laws, one must distinguish the theoretical basis. The author believes that my country's labor laws "should pay attention to the increase of production, and promote labor-management cooperation. In short, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood should be the theoretical basis of labor law." (2) When compiling labor laws, one must first investigate the current state of society. Building cars behind closed doors will naturally not be applicable. The author tells us that "Law is a solution to cure social diseases. The theory only explains the method of dispensing medicine, so in clinical practice, it is impossible to start without detailed observation of the symptoms." The above two points are very worthy of attention by legislators.</p>
<p>The Question of "Culture and Eugenics"</p>
<p>Regarding this question, there are three articles in this issue of "Sociological Miscellany". The first is Sun Benwen's "Culture and Eugenics", which was originally published in the third issue of the first volume of the "Social Science Magazine". Because it aroused Pan Guangdan's debate, it is reprinted here. After Mr. Sun wrote that article "Culture and Eugenics", it aroused Mr. Pan's debate, and he wrote an article "Eugenics and Culture". Then Mr. Sun wanted to rebut, so he wrote another article "Further Discussion on Culture and Eugenics".</p>
<p>We know that Mr. Pan is a eugenicist, and Mr. Sun is a cultural sociologist. He is very opposed to the so-called "psychological inheritance" theory. Naturally, the two of them stand in absolutely opposite positions in academic views. In this way, as the editor said, "I hope that the question of culture and eugenics can become clearer with more debate." The two debated purely from an academic standpoint, each with sufficient basis, criticizing each other, and blaming each other. We naturally admit that, especially in the era when our country's academics are immature, this kind of academic superstitious attitude has considerable value. However, because basic sociology is the most belated science, as for eugenics and cultural sociology, which are still in their infancy, it is difficult for us to say who is right and who is wrong. In short, each is a faithful believer, and each person's words can represent the theories of each school, and they are doing their best to advocate that the theories of each school are correct and scientific. Naturally, it is very worthwhile for us to explore together. Here, we hope that a third party can publish a powerful theory on this issue from an objective attitude.</p>

<p>The Vanguard Weekly, published by the Vanguard Society, was originally scheduled to be published on Sunday. Its sixth issue was delayed until yesterday due to the relocation of the printing house. The main items include: (1) The Mission of Nationalist Literature (Part II), (2) Our Own People (poetry), (3) Talking Points: A. 606, B. Red-Headed Ah San, C. To the Red and Green Literati, (4) Two Orphans, all of which are very exciting, especially the mission of nationalist literature and the works of Pan Sitong of the Talk about White Goose Painting Society.</p>
<p>606 is the most eye-catching. The new poem "Our Own People" was misprinted and could not be corrected. It will be reprinted in the seventh issue. The seventh issue will still be published on schedule on Sunday. The sales offices in Shanghai include Kaiming, Zhenmei, Shanxin Shengming, Jinwu, Daguang, Modern Guanghua bookstores, and major bookstores in other cities.</p>

<p>By American John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 48 American Essays and History</p>
<p>Many extremely magnificent writers are famous in more than one department of literature. From this point of view, classifying writers as essayists, poets, novelists, etc. is somewhat far-fetched and does not conform to the human spirit. In short, Poe, whom we consider in more detail as a poet and storyteller, belongs to the first-class essayist. Those who consider some of Poe's essays and "essays" as the most brilliant moments of his extraordinary talent, I do not want to argue with them.</p>
<p>Poe's short and bumpy life was slightly warmed by the reputation of being a journalist and the fact that his actual good achievements were partially recognized. Emerson followed his clear path as an informal pastor. Thoreau lived mostly alone, making a living with pencils. His essays often touched on public issues, but he never actually participated in those issues. Whatever was enjoyed, in short, two essayists from New England enjoyed a more glorious life in the world, namely Lowell and Holmes.</p>
<p>Holmes was a doctor, a professor of anatomy at Harvard Medical School, and an aristocrat from Boston who built a mansion on Beacon Street. He knew the art of composing light poems fluently with his wit, but the gods did not want him to become a poet. The gods made him an essayist, an extremely excellent essayist, with a pleasant, slow pace and a variety of endless materials. "The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table" is as fresh today as it was when it was published in "The Atlantic Monthly" more than sixty years ago. It gives Holmes the qualifications to be ranked alongside Montaigne and Lamb. As Lowell cleverly commented on him, he was endowed with "the great preservative of fame, namely style."</p>
<p>Moreover, Lowell himself has a talent for prose that rings much more surely in my ears than his delicate talent in poetry. Lowell was a well-bred man, a professor of literature at Harvard University, but certainly not a scholar. He was the minister sent from the United States to England, and a man of considerable influence at the time. His range of interests was wide. His Chaucer essay is the best there is. And when the world was still skeptical about that incredible figure from Illinois, and conservative politicians gave advice that later proved to be an overestimation, Lowell understood Lincoln and with decisive wisdom "estimated his value." Regarding the only part of his poetry that I believe still has vitality, I will talk about it soon. Here, I will only mention the extremely humorous, extremely Yankee-style essay "A Certain Condescension in Foreigners."</p>
<p>America is extremely rich in the makers of history, or the authors of history, who know the method of their own expression. The makers of history with the talent for speech or writing are Franklin, Jefferson, Webster, Lincoln, etc. Other readers will immediately add something to my choice - if we can separate one department of human thought from another - is determined not by political historical judgment, but by purely literary standards.</p>
<p>Franklin's "Autobiography" and his occasional essays and letters may not be things of high value in literary history, but they depict an upright and humorous character in a neat tone, and because Franklin, a practical figure who can be regarded as a "efficiency expert" today, studied Addison's "Spectator" in order to complete his own writing style, he also retains his own strong personality. Also, it has a special literary interest.</p>
<p>Jefferson's national documents and correspondence have more than just historical interest. Whether he was bizarrely wrong or extraordinarily correct in his political theory and practice is not a question for us now. He had a shadow of an artist in his nature. The "Declaration of Independence" he drafted is a model of clear and eloquent wording.</p>
