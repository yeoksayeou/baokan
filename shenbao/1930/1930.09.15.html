<p>美軍史規亞君精悍結實久戰不疲抽球發球勁道充足惜尙欠把握耳至於綱前攔殺功夫已三分得其二矣爲倣效林寳華之聲東擊西法在綱邊輕輕一揮球向横裡射出中華林邱二人竟致束手無策大受觀衆之讚美卜德原係昔日之健將發球有勁攔綱亦佳惟失分頗多總之二人之球藝大非日前扶輪杯賽時可比相去殆有霄壤之别若在該項錦標賽中無中華林邱二將不難横掃全滬榮膺冠軍即稱雄一時之英葡選手亦將望風而倒矣惜哉美國</p>
<p>觀乎中華林邱二人之表演已臻登峯造極邱飛海之捕球極受讚美惟昨日失分較多此爲美中不足林寳華君爲四人中風頭最健者其砲彈式之發球美國二人頗具畏懼之心能還過者甚少故昨日林以發球所得分數至少在二十以上誠暵爲觀止矣平時林之發球第一記甚重如不過綱則第二記之力量減輕頗多而昨日則不然前後二記力道平均不分輕重故尤爲觀者所佩服正手抽球亦具把握可謂其生平傑作二人之聯絡極爲緊凑綱上功夫無懈可擊雙方各出全力奮鬥球勢鋭急非凡蓋各人俱出生平絶技矣林邱这勝固若榮幸美軍之敗亦可欽矣</p>

<p>第二盤　第二盤起雙方依然奮鬭形勢吃緊美軍屢居上風林邱追隨於後自三比三後林邱一躍登先然已用盡九牛二虎之力以五比三超勝雙方花式甚多精彩百出觀衆大爲鼓掌采聲不絶美軍雖奪回一局林邱卒以六比四再勝</p>
<p>第三盤　第三盤開始林邱大施抽擊妙技球勢合度準急非凡美軍則在綱前截擊亦有得以應手之妙球在綱上往返如電觀衆視線爲之花亂不知不覺之中一聲聲之采聲驟使全場空氣益見緊張美軍奮戰得手取勝首局惟是此以後林邱鋒芒愈盛美軍雖繼續苦戰卒致一籌莫展林邱一鼓而下聲勢浩浩得一而再瞬息之間連獲五局且五局中竟有四局係滑四］全勝良非易易於此可見林邱二人之功夫矣後各得一局結果林邱以六比二凱旋</p>

<p>Division of Labor and Cooperation</p>
<p>Division of labor and cooperation are complementary and not contradictory. They are indispensable in the business operations of the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>Why is division of labor necessary? First, to utilize expertise; second, to clarify responsibilities; third, to strictly define authority. The more division of labor there is, the simpler the management becomes, and the more efficient the performance. All production can become more rationalized. However, after division of labor, cooperation is still necessary.</p>
<p>Why is cooperation necessary? First, to facilitate unified response; second, to enable mutual communication; third, to concentrate work easily. Handling affairs occupies an important position in personnel matters for industry and commerce. How to handle these requires considerable connection among various departments on a daily basis to understand the intricacies and relationships within. Department A should know about B's part, and Department B should understand A's part. This cannot be achieved without prior communication. Gathering scattered work and concentrating it in a systematic and organized manner is even more important. It cannot be done without a spirit of unified effort and cooperation. For individuals, the emphasis is on division of labor, with responsibility and clear boundaries as the guiding principles. For groups, the emphasis is on cooperation, with the concept of loyalty to one's duties and diligence at all times.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Political Changes also Occur in Iraq <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The country of Iraq in Asia Minor has recently seen an anti-British movement due to opposition to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The Minister of Finance resigned because the treaty was a *fait accompli* that could not be undone, and the political situation suddenly took a turn. This is also an issue within the nationalist movement.</p>
<p>Iraq is a British mandated territory, formerly Mesopotamia, known for its Mosul oilfields. Some time ago, its King once secretly visited a German newspaper, stating that he wanted to develop the oilfields and seek technological cooperation from Germany, indicating that the land is undoubtedly rich. As for its people, they are of the same ethnicity as the Kurds who rebelled against Turkey this time (according to the World News Agency, the Kurds are scattered across Turkey, Persia, the Soviet Union, and Iraq). Fierce and warlike, they have been fighting for independence. It was not until the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty was signed recently that Iraq's sovereignty and complete independence were recognized, and it was permitted to join the League of Nations. This can be said to have achieved the goal of the movement. However, because there is a clause in the treaty that allows British air force squadrons to be stationed for 25 years, the Iraqi people believe that they have only gained the empty name of independence from British trusteeship, which is contrary to the promised sovereignty and independence. They unanimously expressed that they would rather rise up in an anti-British movement. The Iraqi government, observing public opinion, could not mediate and thus could not feel at ease. The situation is already very serious, and Iraq's border is connected to Turkey. The Kurds in Turkey are also doing their utmost to resist the government in order to regain their freedom. It is feared that the unrest will not be small. The agitation may not only involve the tension between Turkey and Persia, so it is not easy to deal with. Since the rise of national movements, all so-called colonies, autonomous regions, and protected countries have wanted to make further progress. After reaching the first step, they take the second step; after reaching the second step, they take the final step, making sure to achieve true independence. This is why today's national movements around the world are incessant and new problems arise every day.</p>

<p>Naval Minister Issues Statement</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 13th - Following the London Naval Conference, France and Italy are continuing their naval talks. The French Naval Minister has issued a statement that is particularly noteworthy. He stated that France, as the world's second-largest colonial power, needs a sufficient navy to protect its overseas territories and its own coastline. He strongly maintained this point at the London Conference and has not changed his position. France's rights are undeniable, and France's position is unbreakable, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Background of the Kurdish Rebellion <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Major International Conspiracy Involved</p>
<p>Turkey Claims to Have Obtained Sufficient Evidence</p>
<p>Anti-British Sentiment Begins in Iraq</p>
<p>Finance Minister Forced to Resign</p>
<p>Angora, The Kurdish people's resistance to Turkish rule has been recurring intermittently. The Turkish authorities have been unable to completely suppress it due to various reasons. Although this matter appears to be a revolution for freedom by an oppressed nation, it is widely rumored in the Turkish capital that the rebellion is backed by the financial support of European powers. This is intended to allow the Kurds to establish a new nation after their success, thereby expanding their influence in the Near East. The Turkish government claims to have obtained sufficient documentary evidence of the Kurdish rebellion being the result of an international conspiracy, which will be made public if necessary. The rebel organization is extremely widespread, with branches in eight regions of Turkey, including Mardin, Diyarbakir, Erzurum, Sivas, and Elazig. The rebels possess extremely sophisticated and ample firearms and ammunition, which could not have been acquired without foreign funding. When rebel arms are transported from other countries, they must pass through Persian territory, and the Persian government does not detain them, thus at least providing passive support to the rebels. The Turkish government finds this extremely difficult. The total number of Kurds is approximately two to three million, scattered across Turkey, Persia, the Soviet Union, and Iraq. Iraq is under British mandate, so the Kurdish rebellion could trigger a response from the two most powerful nations in Europe, having a significant impact on international politics. The Turkish government is hesitant to act rashly due to these considerations. The Kurdish rebel leader, Sirajuddin, has been captured by Turkish forces, and the Turkish authorities are collecting evidence for a trial on charges of treason. At the same time, they claim to have found new evidence proving the source of the Kurds' large sums of money and the covert assistance of a certain country to this revolution.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Angora, 14th - The Kurdish rebels have been surrounded by government forces and have no way to escape. Their key leaders are all within the encirclement and they will soon be subdued.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Baghdad, 14th - Public sentiment in Iraq is wavering, and political changes are imminent. When the Finance Minister submitted the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty to the Iraqi Cabinet, it was already a foregone conclusion with little room for discussion. He has already resigned. The anti-British movement in Iraq has begun and is not being heavily suppressed. The London Times published a detailed article outlining the importance of this movement in the context of Near Eastern relations.</p>
<h3 id="e43">German Parliamentary Election Heats Up <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Six Thousand Candidates Competing for Over Five Hundred Seats</p>
<p>Clear Division Between Moderate and Extremist Factions</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 13th - At least 35 million voters are expected to participate in tomorrow's general election. The total number of candidates has reached 6,478, including 673 women, competing for 510 seats. There are 900 more candidates competing this year than in 1928. In the last election, 28 women were elected. This election is a decisive battle between the moderate and extremist factions, with the former supporting the current government and the latter being the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party under the leadership of Hitler. Both sides are confident of gaining more seats, but the National Party, which previously held power, is expected to suffer losses. Based on current observations, this election is likely to create a political stalemate because the moderate parties may not be able to gather sufficient strength to form a coalition government. However, Dr. Brüning may be able to obtain the support of the Social Democratic Party or its benevolent neutrality. The election campaign is currently calm. This election is due to the dissolution of Parliament on July 18. The reason for the dissolution of Parliament was the passage of a motion by the Social Democratic Party to revoke the emergency decree on government finances issued by President Hindenburg, with 236 votes in favor and 221 against. The Social Democratic Party's motion was passed because the majority of the German National People's Party, led by Dr. Hugenberg, voted in favor. The National Party, which opposes the Social Democratic Party, supported the Social Democratic Party's motion to overthrow the Brüning Cabinet because Dr. Hugenberg's proposal to include the National Socialist Party in the coalition Cabinet to check the Social Democratic Party was rejected by Brüning.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 14th - It is expected that over 42 million people in Germany will participate in today's general election. With particularly favorable weather, participation is expected to be even more enthusiastic. The core of the Cabinet party anticipates that 10 million people who did not participate in the previous election will now join to support the party. Last night was a frenzy of elections. Unfortunate accidents occurred in Berlin and other cities. The most unfortunate incident occurred in Berlin when several members of the National Socialist Party drove by the Communist Party headquarters in multiple cars and suddenly opened fire with pistols. A great disturbance ensued, resulting in one death and several injuries, with seven people in critical condition. Otherwise, the situation is generally peaceful. This morning, there were no disturbances. The streets were crowded with people heading to the polls. Cars from various parties continuously passed by, carrying flags and shouting slogans. The working-class areas were almost entirely covered in red flags, representing the two major factions of workers: the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. In contrast, the western district of the capital had few red flags. The flags were mostly black-red-gold and black-white-red. The most prominent parties on the streets were the Communist Party, the National Party, and the Social Democratic Party. Most of the members of the other parties worked quietly behind the scenes. President Hindenburg, members of the Central Government, ministers of Prussia, and key officials all went to the polls together. The election is scheduled to close at 5:00 PM, and the results may be available roughly by evening.</p>

<p>Making a trans-Pacific flight</p>
<p>Electrical Communication Agency, Misawa, 14th - The trans-Pacific aircraft [Tacoma] departed at 5:09 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Electrical Communication Agency, Tokyo, 14th - According to news from the Otchishi Radio Station, the Tacoma aircraft passed over Nousu, 6,000 miles west of Nemuro, at around 8:00 AM, flying northeast.</p>
<p>Electrical Communication Agency, Misawa, 14th - Today is a day to be remembered in the history of world aviation. The Tacoma aircraft, attempting to cross the Pacific Ocean without landing, took off this morning and headed towards the American mainland. Lieutenant Brougham and Engineer Coty had already gotten up at 2:00 AM, put on their navy blue uniforms, and after breakfast, arrived at the airfield at 3:45 AM. After conducting a preliminary test flight and confirming that the engine and everything else was satisfactory, they decided to proceed with the trans-Pacific flight. In addition to carrying 1,200 gallons of gasoline, the aircraft was also loaded with a large quantity of food, including 70 pieces of meat sandwiches, two roasted chickens, ten hard-boiled eggs, five liters of coffee, and two liters of water. After exchanging farewells with Aviation Official Tanaka and others, they waved goodbye to the 200-plus villagers of Misawa who had worked through the night to build the runway and provide all kinds of assistance. As the villagers cheered and wished them success, the eastern sky gradually brightened. Lieutenant Brougham and Engineer Coty boarded the aircraft. At 5:07 AM, they started the engine and cut the tethering rope. The aircraft slid out slightly to the left from the thick-plated runway. By the time it reached the halfway point of the runway, the tail was already raised. At 5:09 AM, the aircraft was soaring upward. After about three minutes, the aircraft, flying at an altitude of about 50 feet, turned its nose from south to east and climbed higher and higher. As the morning mist gradually cleared, the silhouette of the aircraft gradually disappeared into the clouds over the North Sea. A gentle west wind was blowing that day, which was very suitable for flying.</p>

While repairs were being made urgently, the cars behind were stopped one by one. The last streetcar, No. 1715, connecting four cars, was speeding from Tokyo. As it approached the station, the driver realized that the cars in front were stopped. The driver frantically applied the brakes, but it was too late, and it crashed violently into the cars in front. It was evening, and employees from various companies were returning home from work, so the cars were full. As a result of the collision, the car bodies shattered, and people were thrown onto the road. Over a hundred people were seriously injured, and another 170 to 180 suffered minor injuries and did not require hospitalization. This is a rare streetcar disaster in recent years.

<p>National News Agency, Hamburg, 13th - Professor Erruya, director of the National Library of Peru, gave a lecture here today on the family history of Columbus, which aroused great interest. According to his research in ancient Spanish books, Columbus, the discoverer of the New World, was not the son of an Italian wool merchant from Genoa, as is commonly believed, but the son of the captain of a Catalan pirate ship. His father had already sailed to the shores of present-day North America with Danish pirates, passing through Ireland, Greenland, and Newfoundland, reaching as far as the Florida peninsula at the southern tip of the United States. Columbus knew of this new land and therefore chose a closer and safer route to set sail.</p>

<p>For the Public Assessment of All Newspapers: Considering that my Department has been trying to appease the miscellaneous troops in various places to prevent them from being used by the enemy, Zhao Jie was appointed as the commander of the Garrison Army and Dong Zhentang as the deputy commander to handle the work of incorporation. Now, Commander Zhao Jie has been assassinated by bandits, and the title of the Garrison Army has long been ordered to be abolished. However, reports continue to state that recently, some unscrupulous people are using the above title to gather troops in various places, disturbing the local areas, apparently taking advantage of the name for their own selfish purposes. In addition to telegraphing the governments of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong to instruct local officials to strictly arrest and investigate, we have specially telegraphed to you, requesting that you publish it in your newspaper for public knowledge in order to prevent confusion and deception.

<h3 id="e56">Details of the Passage of the Civil Procedure Law <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Procedure Law was passed on its third reading by the Legislative Yuan on the 13th. The following is a brief account of the revision of the law: Last year, the Legal System Committee of the Yuan believed that the Civil Procedure Law of our country had been in use for a long time, and that many of its provisions were no longer applicable due to the passage of time and changing circumstances. Therefore, the Committee decided to entrust Luo Ding and Liu Kejian with the responsibility of revising the law. Luo and Liu worked tirelessly day and night, but because there were many articles, it was not easy to complete the task in a short time. Therefore, it was not until the summer of this year that the draft was finally completed. The draft was then discussed by all members of the Legal Committee for several weeks. The draft was then submitted to President Hu, who convened the 108th Yuan meeting on the 2nd of this month to discuss the draft. The second reading was not passed until the 6th, but several articles were controversial. Therefore, it was decided to hand it back to the original review committee for revision before submitting it to the meeting again. When the Yuan was in session, Liu Kejian, one of the original review committee members, had been ordered by the National Government to go to Europe to attend the International Criminal Law Conference. Therefore, when the committee members had questions and debates about the articles during the meeting, Luo Ding answered them alone. Yesterday (the 13th), the Yuan held its 109th meeting. Luo reported on the revised version of the articles that had been reserved for discussion. After discussion, the revised version was passed. It was then decided to skip the third reading procedure and pass the revised version of the entire law. The original review committee will be responsible for organizing the articles. In addition, there is a section on personal litigation law in the law. Since it is closely related to the Family and Inheritance sections of the Civil Code, it is difficult to discuss until the two sections have been passed. Therefore, it was decided after a meeting that it would be discussed after the Family and Inheritance sections of the Civil Code have been passed. It has not yet been decided whether to create a separate law or to make it the final section.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Soon-to-Be-Received Weihaiwei <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Weihaiwei: Weihaiwei was once an important stronghold of the Beiyang Fleet. During the Sino-Japanese War, the entire naval fleet was destroyed and subsequently occupied by Japan. It was then leased to Britain, and the right to rule was not ours for more than thirty years. The lease term was originally twenty-five years, and it expired as early as 1922. At that time, the Beijing government sent Liang Ruhou to Weihai to prepare for the reception, but the issue of Liugong Island could not be resolved, so the agreement was not signed. Moreover, internal unrest was frequent, and there was no time to take care of it, so the matter was delayed until now. This spring, negotiations were resumed, and the British agreed to continue to occupy part of Liugong Island for ten years before returning it on October 1. The date of return is not far away. Although foreign newspapers reported that the British would use the excuse of the ongoing civil war in China to postpone the return, based on the reporter's observation, the British employees currently serving in Weihai are all preparing to return home. Moreover, the lease has expired for seven or eight years, so there is probably no excuse to be used. It is also heard that British Ambassador Lampson's trip south is for this matter, so the return date should not be changed midway.</p>
<p>The population of Weihaiwei is not large, and inland transportation is not very convenient, so commerce has not been very developed. In recent years, due to various reasons, businesses have closed one after another, and there are few people starting new businesses. Currently, what maintains the market is the entrepot trade. Weihaiwei is a leased territory and not a commercial port, so there is no customs office. In addition to paying a 1.1% donation for import and export goods, there are no other expenses. In other words, for goods from foreign countries that are transshipped through Tianjin, Shanghai, or Dalian, only a donation of 1.1 yuan per 100 yuan is required. There are no customs duties or other taxes. As a result, entrepot traders gather here to find ways to avoid taxes with tax-free goods, and the shipping industry has also developed as a result. According to investigations, the number of ships entering the port and unloading cargo each month is approximately 100 or more. Cargo is piled up like mountains on the docks. Goods unloaded from ships today can be repackaged onto sailing ships tomorrow and transshipped to other places to avoid customs duties. For goods such as tobacco and alcohol, they are repackaged and disguised as other goods for sale in various places. It can be said that unscrupulous merchants are doing everything possible to evade taxes, and the national tax revenue is greatly reduced. As a result, people are reminded of other rights that have been lost due to unequal treaties, and there are many more examples.</p>
<p>The prosperity of the entrepot trade is as described above, and the prices of real estate and the entire market depend on it to flourish. Once the recovery is implemented, there will be no room for entrepot traders to stand, and the commercial market is in danger of falling sharply. This is something that those in authority must hope to remedy as soon as possible. (September 7th)</p>

The members of the Provincial Committee in Jinan were Li Shuchun, Wang Xiangrong, He Siyuan, Zhang Yunyi, and Wang Fangting. Han immediately telegraphed Ma Hongkui, Liu Zhennian, and Zhang Honglie to come to Jinan to take office at the same time. Liu Zhennian was unable to leave Jinan because the situation in Yantai was important. Zhang Honglie was in Guide and could not come immediately. Ma Hongkui received the telegram in Taian and arrived in Jinan by special train at 11:00 AM today (the 11th). At 3:00 PM, Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Finance Director Wang Xiangrong, Education Director He Siyuan, Agriculture and Mining Director Wang Fangting, Provincial Committee member Zhang Yunyi, and Ma Hongkui were sworn in simultaneously.

<h3 id="e59">The Jiaoji Railway After the Great War <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Jiaoji Railway, since its construction and opening to traffic by the Germans, has suffered war damage for the first time this year. The railway's Chairman, Sa Fujun, and Deputy Director of Transportation, Tan Shukui, arrived in Jinan this morning (the 10th) on a special train with Finance Minister Song Ziwen. Upon arrival, Mr. Ping asked Tan about the purpose of their visit. Tan replied that the Chairman's visit to Jinan was to accompany Minister Song to attend Chairman Han's inauguration ceremony and to inspect the railway's war losses. Ping then inquired about the extent of the war losses, to which Tan provided the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Losses of Business and Property: The railway's usual monthly revenue is around one million yuan. This year, due to the suspension of operations for forty-five days because of the war, the loss is about 1.5 million yuan. Although traffic resumed during the four months before and after the war, the reduction in business resulted in another loss of approximately 1.5 million yuan. Ten bridge sections were bombed, including the largest, the Zihe Bridge, resulting in a loss of over one million yuan. Additionally, the reduced income during the suspension of operations, coupled with the requirement to pay workers three days' wages for each day worked in the war zone, resulted in considerable expenses. The total estimated loss is around 4.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Losses of Various Vehicles: The railway originally had 105 locomotives, 219 passenger cars, 1,679 freight cars, and 14 miscellaneous cars. During the retreat of the Jin Army, they took with them 3 locomotives and 54 passenger and freight cars. Furthermore, when the National Army recovered Jinan and transported troops south, they requisitioned another 5 trains, totaling 5 locomotives and over 100 freight cars. Recently, 2 more trains were transferred, including 2 locomotives and over 30 passenger and freight cars. In total, approximately 7 locomotives and 200 passenger and freight cars were transferred. Last year, Yang Hucheng's army took 7 locomotives and over 100 freight cars south, and Sun Dianying's army took 2 locomotives and 50 freight cars, which are not included in the above figures (the locomotives taken by Yang and Sun belonged to the Jiaoji Railway, but most of the remaining cars belonged to other railways). Currently, the First Army Corps is still occupying over 200 cars on the railway. Although the cars are still on the railway, they are not under the control of the railway bureau, which still affects business.</p>
<p>(3) Current Business Revenue and Expenses: Since the resumption of traffic on the 20th of last month, the average daily revenue until the end of the month was 15,000 yuan. This month, up to today (the 10th), the average daily revenue is 25,000 yuan, amounting to just over 700,000 yuan per month. However, monthly expenses, including employee salaries and all other expenses and materials, amount to 700,000 yuan, and monthly interest payments on Japanese debt amount to 200,000 yuan, resulting in a significant deficit. Interest payments on Japanese debt in the second half of the year will be particularly difficult. Currently, 80% of freight cars have been restored, with eight freight trains running daily between Qingdao and Jinan (four from each direction). Branch lines, which originally had sixteen freight trains running daily (eight in each direction), are now only running six. Passenger traffic has been restored to 80%, with four passenger trains running between Qingdao and Jinan, and two between Jinan and Fangzi. However, the special express night trains No. 1 and 2 have not yet been restored due to the incomplete suppression of bandits along the route.</p>
<p>(4) Future Rectification Methods: The railway has never experienced war before, and this is the first time. The order of the entire railway has deteriorated significantly, and the morale of the employees has also been greatly affected. Forty to sixty troop trains used to run daily between Qingdao and Zihedian, one can imagine the utter devastation. Rectification is no easy task. Due to the shortage of freight cars, it has been decided to increase the turnover rate and run more trips. An order has been placed with Belgium for 100 new freight cars, each with a load capacity of 40 tons, which is equivalent to about 260 of the railway's current freight cars (the current Jiaoji Railway freight cars each have a load capacity of only 15 tons). These new cars are expected to cost 800,000 yuan, and a batch is expected to arrive in October. Approval has also been obtained from the Ministry of Railways to order six new boilers, which will slightly alleviate the freight situation. As for the bridges, the required funds are too large, and repairs cannot be made until next year. The Transportation Department has scheduled a section meeting in Jinan this Saturday, with the heads of each transportation section and the department's section chiefs attending to discuss railway rectification matters.

<h3 id="e61">Finance and Education in Jiangxi <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Political Expenses in Arrears for Several Months</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Schools Completely Suspended</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi's annual budget for both revenue and expenditure is 14 million yuan, with an average monthly revenue and expenditure of one million yuan. However, since last year, the bandits and communists have devastated the local economy. Gannnan and Ganxi have no revenue at all, and only the ten or so counties near the provincial capital in Gandong and Ganbei have a small amount of funds to contribute. Monthly revenue is about 100,000 yuan (about one-tenth of the budget), which is tens of thousands of yuan short. The provincial government believes that suppressing the bandits is the only way out at present, so it has decided to concentrate financial resources solely on suppressing the bandits. In terms of political expenses, only the most urgent matters are addressed, resulting in accumulated arrears of several million yuan. Some agencies have received salaries up to June, some up to May, and some even only up to March or April. Public officials are complaining incessantly. In order to increase the province's revenue, the Finance Department issued a proclamation to auction off the city moat land in the provincial capital, estimating that it could generate more than one million yuan. However, in these times of popular poverty and financial exhaustion, no one has inquired about it. More than one million yuan worth of rice export permits (each permit taxing two yuan per picul of exported rice) have been printed and requests for them are pouring in, but it is only a drop in the bucket. Finance Director Chen went to Xunyang in the past month to personally borrow more than 200,000 yuan from the refined salt merchants for the expenses of suppressing the bandits, but it was also of no avail. Later, he went to Beijing from Xunyang to report everything to Minister Song and asked for relief. Minister Song agreed to issue tens of thousands of yuan in public bonds, but later abandoned the idea because the province's various industries were depressed and there was no way to promote their sale. According to sources in the Finance Department, Finance Director Chen has not yet returned to the province, and the provincial government has repeatedly telegraphed him to return to the province immediately to coordinate everything because hundreds of matters are awaiting disbursement. In addition, in order to alleviate the current problem of maintaining food for the military police suppressing the bandits, the provincial government has decided to levy two months' rent in the provincial capital, which is currently being handled by the Finance Department in conjunction with the municipal finance bureau, with a deadline of half a month to collect it all in order to avoid delaying military operations. As for the financial treasury bonds and interest-bearing short-term circulating bonds issued by the Finance Department, several issues have not been redeemed, and their prices are inevitably declining. The circulating bonds have slightly rebounded because the Finance Department has allocated 300,000 yuan in rice export permits as a redemption fund for May, June, and July. In recent days, they can be used at a 90% rate.</p>
<p>Education is closely related to finance. If funds are exhausted, education cannot develop peacefully. It is found that there are 33 specialized secondary schools and vocational schools in the province, with annual education expenses of about 2 million yuan (salt revenue surcharges are allocated to education and treasury bond funds). These schools have relied on salt revenue surcharges for funding. However, these funds have now been diverted to suppressing the bandits. The previous year's education expenses are in arrears for two months, and this year's (the 19th year) budget has not yet been announced, and there are no funds at all. All public secondary schools and above have not enrolled students and have completely suspended classes. Initially, Director Jiang intended to borrow 500,000 yuan in rice export permits from the Finance Department, with 200,000 yuan for start-up expenses and 300,000 yuan for maintenance expenses. Except for the secondary schools in bandit areas such as Xiushui, Guixi, and Ningdu, which could not open, all the others would open. However, in reality, only tens of thousands of yuan were borrowed. Overseas students had to be remitted quickly because international reputation was at stake, and municipal small subsidies, which were few in number, had to be issued in advance. After paying the above two items, secondary schools and above received one-third of one month's funding, which could only be used for maintenance expenses, and there was no question of opening classes. The municipal primary schools in Nanchang receive only a little over ten thousand yuan per month. Because the municipal government is extremely poor, half a month's salary was owed in the previous year, and there is no funding for this school year. Each primary school receives only a few hundred yuan, and most teachers' salaries are meager, so they cannot be in arrears for long. Therefore, all the teachers and staff of the municipal primary schools unanimously decided not to attend classes until they receive funding. The primary schools that have been open for half a month are still inactive. In addition, only one-third of the compulsory education in each county that is not a bandit county can be taught safely. The entire province's education is almost completely suspended, with tens of thousands of students out of school and thousands of unemployed teachers and staff. It is unknown how the authorities will deal with the aftermath. (September 9th and 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Guangzhou Restaurant Industry Strike <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangzhou restaurant and teahouse industry went on strike because they opposed the banquet donation company's use of two-part numbered forms for donation extraction. Those on strike for the 6th and 7th included Nanyuan, Wenyuan, Xiyuan, Dasanyuan, Moshan, Luyu Residence, Chaxiang Room, Yupolou, Yulaochun, Taoliyuan, Yijing, Jupo, Shuangying, and Yutangchun. Western restaurants included Taipingguan, Taiping Branch, Anleyuan, America, and Washington. In addition, there were a total of more than 120 small restaurants and drinking shops. The few that did not strike included Yongchun, Qunle, Jinghua, and Yanchuntai in Chentang, which offer floral entertainment, and a few low-level restaurants. Fearing that the trend would expand and become even more difficult to manage, the Finance Department planned to summon the banquet donation merchants and restaurant industry representatives to the department on the afternoon of the 7th to discuss a solution. However, the restaurant industry did not send representatives to attend, and no solution could be found. Later that night, Chen Fuchou, the owner of Wenyuan, Lin Ji, the owner of Dasanyuan, and Ye Shaopeng, the owner of Moshan, met with the representatives of the donation merchants at the Yongchun Restaurant in Chentang to discuss final mediation methods. Around 10:00 PM, as the meeting was about to end, several police officers arrived at the Yongchun Restaurant and summoned Chen Fuchou, Lin Ji, and Ye Shaopeng to the Chentang Sub-bureau, where they were detained and transferred to the Finance Department's Special Task Force headquarters for custody. It is reported that after the authorities took the three into custody, they planned to first order the major restaurants such as Wenyuan, Nanyuan, Dasanyuan, Xiyuan, and Moshan to resume business as usual before listening to solutions to avoid the trend from expanding. However, the restaurant industry had jointly stamped and resolved to act unanimously before the strike, so their attitude remained unchanged. Furthermore, due to the arrest of Chen, Lin, and Ye, a secret meeting was convened again on the 8th to decide on countermeasures: (1) To insist on the strike until the goal of cancellation is achieved; (2) To issue a declaration requesting criticism from all sectors; (3) To send letters to all related industries for their strong support; (4) To restrict the remaining ten or so restaurants that have not struck to strike together to show their determination. On one hand, each restaurant and shop sent two or three representatives, totaling several hundred people, to the provincial government to petition for the immediate release of the three arrested. Since the restaurant industry's strike, many industries have been affected and goods have been stagnant. In particular, goods that rely on restaurant industry sales and cannot be stored for too long, such as livestock, have been most affected. The market price has therefore tended to fall, so merchants trading with the restaurant industry all hope for an early solution and resumption of business to avoid being affected. However, the Finance Department insists that the implementation of the two-part form is necessary to prevent the concealment of donations and is still insisting on it. (September 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Graduation Ceremony at the Northeastern Military Academy <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Northeastern Military Academy is the main institution for military education in the Northeast. The graduates have reached the tenth class. The graduates of the previous nine classes have been distributed to the various troops in the Northeast and have become the backbone. Now the tenth class is also graduating. Because Zhang Xueliang was delayed in Huludao and had not returned, it was postponed until the 9th of this month before it was held. This time there are more than 1,700 graduates, divided into 17 teams, including 12 infantry teams, 1 cavalry team, and 2 artillery and engineering teams each. On that day, Zhang Xueliang and other dignitaries all attended. When Zhang arrived at the school, he was wearing a domestically produced gray cloth military uniform. He first went to the reception room for a short rest, and then summoned the 80 students transferred by the Central Government and the 20 students transferred by Liu Chunrong to give separate talks. Then he went to the field to issue certificates and hold the awards ceremony. The awards were divided into first, second, and third class, with ten people in the first class receiving a military knife and a leather clip, ten people in the second class receiving a knife handle case, and ten people in the third class receiving a military knife, all of which were personally awarded by Zhang. Afterwards, he gave a speech to all the students, urging them to always keep the country in mind and never forget their ambitions while at school. After Zhang finished speaking, Yuan Jinkai, the deputy chairman of the Northeastern Political Affairs Committee, and Shi Yixian, the chairman of Liaoning Province, gave speeches, all with the intention of encouraging them. Then, Zhou Lian, the director of education of the Military Academy, gave a reply on behalf of the school. Finally, all the students shouted the oath: "Loyally obey superiors, strive to do my best in battle and defense, do not covet unjust wealth, do not avoid danger within my duty, be determined to defend against insults and protect the people, and swear to wash away all national humiliation." The above six oaths will be faithfully followed throughout my life. After the oath, photos were taken and the meeting adjourned. (September 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Establishment of a 3 Million Loan for the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Half from the Far Eastern Bank and Half from the Bank of China</p>
<p>The Board of Directors Resolves to Implement Austerity Measures</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) plans to borrow money from banks due to insufficient funds. It is reported that this matter was first negotiated with the British-owned Citibank, and an agreement was largely reached. However, due to jealousy from the Japanese banking community, rumors were fabricated that Russia was transferring the CER to the United States, causing the Russian side to suspend negotiations. However, the railway urgently needs funds and cannot overcome the difficulties without borrowing a large sum of money. Therefore, it has changed to negotiating with the Soviet Russian Far Eastern Bank and our Chinese Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Northeast Three Provinces Bank, and Frontier Bank, and the board of directors has ordered the railway bureau to send the Director of the Funding Department and the Director of the General Accounting Department to be responsible for negotiations. Recently, an agreement has been reached to borrow a total of 3 million yuan, with the Chinese and Russian banks each providing half. The funds can be withdrawn within this week. The interest rate of the Far Eastern Bank is 5%, and the interest rate of the China Bank is 1.2%, with a term of three months. The debt will be repaid after the winter when transportation is prosperous. At the beginning of this month, the railway bureau's revenue and expenditure department and the funds deposited in the bank were only 832,739 yuan, while the accumulated bills to be paid amounted to 2.3 million yuan, including the purchase of materials and the severance pay and pensions due to the laid-off employees. The existing funds are insufficient to pay off the debts, with a shortfall of about 1.5 million rubles. In addition, it is almost the 20th of this month, the day to pay salaries, which requires another 1.5 million rubles. The funds borrowed this time are still insufficient to pay for everything, so it may continue to negotiate loans with other banks. The railway's poor performance this year is mainly due to the impact of the high value of gold and the low value of silver. Green and North Manchurian specialties have always been shipped to Europe in large quantities, and the CER relies on the income from freight to maintain the economy of the entire railway. After the gold rush occurred, European merchants believed that the prices of North Manchurian products, including freight, were higher than those of local European products, so they all stopped purchasing them, causing the specialties to be unable to be shipped out, indirectly causing significant losses to the CER. Although winter specialties can be put on the market, it is feared that the railway's income is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Because the CER is suffering from a shortage of funds, it convened a board of directors meeting on the 8th and resolved to implement austerity measures. The entire plan resolved is as follows: (1) The olive oil refinery and hemp factory will be merged into the General Factory according to the railway bureau's original proposal. (2) The mixed custody of soybeans will be merged into the Commercial Affairs Office. Because the freight solicitation department has been cancelled, it will also be merged into the Commercial Affairs Office. (3) The Hailar wool washing factory has been investigated and found to have no losses and still has annual surpluses. According to the railway bureau's original proposal, it can be placed under the control of the Commercial Affairs Office. (4) It has now been decided to cancel 14 commercial affairs offices along the line from August 15th of this year. The expenses of the provincial offices will be strictly reviewed by the budget committee. (5) The Observatory has already been cancelled, and there are no problems. (6) It is resolved that the Central Library will be changed to the Chinese Eastern Railway Library and will be located in the former Director-General's Office, without adding additional housing. The number of expenses is determined to be over 60,000 yuan in total by both sides. The number of office staff will be divided equally between the two parties. (7) The Water and Electricity Plant will be handled according to the railway bureau's original proposal. (8) The Central Factory of the Works Department will be handled according to the original proposal. The Railway Printing Office can be appropriately increased in funding. (9) The Photography Studio of the Works Department can be handled according to the original proposal. (10) The Tree Cultivation Garden will be handled according to the railway bureau's original proposal, and its budget is determined to be paid half. (11) The Real Estate Department will not be cancelled for the time being, and its budget is determined to be strictly reviewed by the budget committee. (12) A separate budget will be made for the Grand Hotel to ensure that revenue and expenditure are balanced. The railway bureau will not subsidize it, and the hotel staff will not be considered railway staff and will cease all benefits. (13) The soda factory will continue to operate because it is not losing money. (14) According to the Director's report, the sawmill still needs to saw railroad ties and other materials until the end of this year, so it is inconvenient to stop operating for the time being, but its expenses can be reduced. At the same time, the Shitouhezi Sawmill will be closed, and a separate budget will be made from next year. (15) Because the Sino-Russian Vocational School is jointly owned by both parties and is specifically designed to train mid-level technical railway staff, it is inconvenient to transfer it to the Education Department. The budget committee will strictly review the budget, but one more Chinese vice-principal should be added. (16) The Agriculture Section will not be transferred to the Commercial Affairs Office for the time being. This section should be resolved at the same time as the reorganization of the Land Survey Department. All the creamery, pig farm, and horse farm belonging to the section will be cancelled. (17) Part of the Veterinary Department will be cancelled, and the remaining part will be merged into the Medical Department, saving 200,000 yuan per year. (18) The railway bureau should find a way to rent out the Climate Sanatorium for the year. (19) The garage can be rented to private individuals or the expenses can be reduced. (20) The budget of the Editorial Department will be reduced. (21) The Sino-Russian Language Training Institute will remain the same. (22) The Zhalainuoer Coal Mine will first operate on a small scale and explore other coal seams. (23) The Central Printing Office will continue to print tickets as usual. The staff of the office will be divided into two parts. Those who print tickets will be railway staff, and the rest will be hired by the director as business and will not be treated as railway staff.

<p>Anhui Bandits Intend to Invade Youjing: The notorious bandit Jiang Guochang of Anhui Province recently led 500-600 bandits to besiege Tongcheng Town, under the jurisdiction of Tianchang County. It is reported that Jiang's bandits were fiercely resisted by the garrison troops and the self-defense corps of Tongcheng Town, and reinforcements from Tianchang County arrived, so they were unable to succeed. They looted the nearby villages, occupied Xiaoyun Mountain, and ordered the bandit leader Wang Qitaiye to lead his men to attack Licheng Town, under the jurisdiction of Bao'ying County. Fortunately, the gun towers in the town were able to resist, repelling the bandits. On the afternoon of the 10th, they attacked again, but Bao'ying County had dispatched naval and land police teams to the town for reinforcement, making it difficult for the bandits to achieve their goal. It is now reported that they intend to invade towns such as Yingjiaqiao and Jingou in Gaoyou County, causing panic among the people. Wealthy households are moving away, and the town chiefs have jointly petitioned the county government to send troops quickly to strengthen defenses and deter the bandits.</p>
<p>Detailed Report on the Drowning of the Woman with the Surname Xue: Xue Jixing, a farmer from the sixth village of the second district of the county, married Chen Yuedian, the daughter of Yang Hanxiang, last year. Chen had been suffering from an external illness, so she stayed at her mother's house to seek medical treatment. She gradually recovered and returned home alone on the 30th of last month. However, she accidentally fell into the river west of Xiaolizhuang and drowned. Chen Yuedian heard the news the next day and confirmed that it was her daughter. She then hired laborers, along with relatives Chen Shaoxuan and Chen Guoming, to carry the body to Xue Jixing's house. They used iron chains to lock Jixing's wife to the corpse. After much mediation, Xue Jixing was persuaded to pay 400 yuan for funeral expenses. Xue had agreed, but the village chief Chen Shaoxuan intervened. Xue then appealed to the county government for an autopsy. The county government dispatched Zhou Shaoji with a coroner to conduct the autopsy. The village chief Chen Shaoxuan led over 100 people to disrupt the scene. Zhou Shaoji repeatedly tried to pacify them before they dispersed. The autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was drowning. The trial was held yesterday. After the interrogation, both parties were instructed to post bail and await investigation. However, village chief Chen Shaoxuan is suspected of attempted extortion and has been detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>Bandits Disarm Police Station at Buliangqiao: At 7:00 PM on the 10th, many bandits suddenly broke into the Buliangqiao Police Station in Yinnan, claiming to disarm the police. The police were few in number and dared not resist, so the bandits took away all their firearms. At that time, a woman surnamed Yang, who lived nearby, heard the noise and went outside to watch.

<p>Civil Affairs Department Approves the County Boundary of Lihaisuo: Lihaisuo borders the two counties of Shangyu and Shaoxing. In April, the Civil Affairs Department commissioned instructor Shi Fuchang to work with the two county magistrates to jointly delineate the complex county boundary at Lihaisuo. The department has now approved the demarcation based on Shi’s report, using the intersection of the crossroads in Lihaisuo as the boundary line, with the southwest gates within the city under the jurisdiction of Shangyu, and the northeast gates under the jurisdiction of Shaoxing. Other areas will remain unchanged for the time being. Both county governments are required to clearly hand over the residents, household registration, land registers, and other documents immediately.

<p>| Affected by Military Affairs |</p>
<p>May Open on October 1st</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Due to the impact of the war, secondary and higher schools in the province have not yet opened. It is heartbreaking that 12 provincial middle schools, 4 normal schools, 2 rural normal schools, 1 senior high school, 1 women's normal school, 2 vocational schools, 1 women's vocational school, and 1 women's middle school, with a total of five or six thousand young students, have been interrupted in their studies. Students from wealthier families have mostly gone to other provinces to enroll in classes, while poorer students are unable to do so and can only lament their helplessness. Private schools that could not recruit students in previous years are now overcrowded, with most of the students having transferred from provincial schools. However, there are more students than schools can accommodate, with only less than 5% being accepted. The Education Department has repeatedly convened meetings of the principals of these schools to discuss solutions, but it is difficult for even the cleverest housewife to cook without rice. He Siyuan, the director of the Education Department, has been discussing with the newly appointed Chairman Han Fuju, and they have decided to reduce the scope and simplify matters to barely open the schools. The plan is to temporarily exclude schools north of the Yellow River, and to reduce the budget of the remaining provincial schools by half, merging classes to save money and barely open the schools. It is rumored that the schools may open on October 1st.</p>

<p>China Defeats the United States 6-4, 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>England Defeats Portugal 8-6, 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>China and England Win the Right to the Robert Cup Final in Shanghai. In the semi-finals at the French Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon, China defeated the tenacious United States 6-4, 6-4, 6-2, and England defeated Portugal 8-6, 6-4, 6-2. The details of the two matches are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e87">(1) The Brilliant Match Between Lin Qiu and the United States <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The match between China and the United States began at 3:00 PM. Both sides put on a brilliant performance, and the competition was fierce. The Chinese representatives, Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, fought hard and dared not relax. The US representatives, Squier and Bode, also fought bravely and refused to be outdone. The interest in the match overflowed to the more than 200 spectators, who were moved by every word and action. It can be said that this was the most intense and brilliant doubles match in the current Robert Cup.</p>
<p>Mr. Squier of the US team is lean and strong, enduring and tireless. His shots and serves are powerful, but he lacks control. As for his net play, he has already mastered two-thirds of it. He imitated Lin Baohua's feinting tactics, and with a light flick of the ball at the net, the ball shot out sideways, leaving Lin Qiu of China helpless. He was greatly praised by the audience. Bode was a former strong player, with powerful serves and good net play, but he lost many points overall. In short, the two men's skills were very different from the Rotary Cup matches, with a world of difference. If there were no Lin Qiu of China in the championship, they would have easily swept Shanghai and won the championship. Even the British and Portuguese players, who are the heroes of the time, would have been intimidated. What a pity for the United States.</p>
<p>Observing the performance of Lin Qiu of China, it has reached the peak. Qiu Feihai's catch was greatly praised, but he lost more points yesterday, which was a shortcoming. Mr. Lin Baohua was the most energetic of the four. The two Americans were very afraid of his cannonball serve, and few could return it. Therefore, Lin's serve scored at least twenty points yesterday, which was truly amazing. Usually, Lin's first serve is very heavy, but if it doesn't go over the net, the power of the second serve is reduced. But yesterday it was different, the power of the two serves was average, without distinguishing between light and heavy, so it was especially admired by the audience. His forehand shot also had a grip, which can be said to be his masterpiece. The two men's connection was very tight, and their net skills were impeccable. Both sides fought with all their strength, and the ball was extremely sharp. Everyone showed their best skills. Lin Qiu's victory was fortunate, but the defeat of the US military was also admirable.</p>
<p>First Set: Bode's serve was accurate and fast, and he won the first game. When Lin Baohua served, the United States fought hard with a downward momentum, and the fight was fierce. Lin Qiu cautiously fought and managed to win two games in a row. The US military was unwilling to be weak and fought hard to pull back a game. Then each won a game, and the score was tied at three games each. The competition was even fiercer, and no one was willing to relax. The battle dragged on and was difficult to separate. Lin Qiu won two games in a row with ingenuity, and then Bode served and won four chips, becoming 5-4. Lin Baohua returned the color with a heavy ball, and as a result, Lin Qiu won the first set 6-4.</p>
<p>Second Set: At the beginning of the second set, both sides continued to fight, and the situation was tense. The US military took the lead many times, and Lin Qiu followed behind. After 3-3, Lin Qiu took the lead in one leap, but they had used up all their energy to overtake by 5-3. There were many styles on both sides, and the audience applauded and cheered. Although the US military regained a game, Lin Qiu won again 6-4.</p>
<p>Third Set: At the beginning of the third set, Lin Qiu showed off their smashing skills, and the ball was well-proportioned, accurate, and fast. The US military also had a wonderful way to respond by intercepting at the net. The ball went back and forth on the net like electricity, and the audience's vision was disturbed. Unconsciously, the cheers suddenly made the atmosphere on the field even more tense. The US military fought hard and won the first game, but after this, Lin Qiu's brilliance became more and more intense. Although the US military continued to fight hard, they finally had no way to do anything. Lin Qiu made a downward momentum, and in an instant, they won five games in a row. It was not easy to win all five games so easily. It can be seen from this that Lin Qiu's skills are very good. After each winning a game, Lin Qiu returned in triumph with a score of 6-2.</p>
<h3 id="e88">(2) England Wins the Fierce Battle Against Portugal <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>After the Sino-US war, the bell rang four times, and the British and Portuguese players took the stage to fight. The British players were Hughes and Stock, and the Portuguese players were Canavaro and Korasa. In the second set, England took a 5-1 lead and had a great momentum, but Canavaro of Portugal fought hard, and the two British players showed their skills in a majestic manner, adding five games in a row and climbing to the top with 6-5. But after that, the British military tried to attack Korasa of Portugal, and Korasa had difficulty parrying, resulting in failure. England won with a score of 8-6. It was a pity for the defeat of the Portuguese army. In the next two sets, it was easier for the British to win. However, the British players ran back and forth and seemed very tired. As a result, England won the second and third sets with a score of 6-4 and 6-2.</p>

<p>Due to continuous rain and excessively soft tracks, coupled with strong headwinds, all track records at the World Women's Games have deteriorated day by day. The Polish athlete, Konopacka, won first place with her second throw. In the 60-meter final, Hitomi had a very fast start, leading within the first 30 meters. However, the emerging Dutch athlete, Schuurman, and the English athlete, Biscoe, gradually caught up, and Hitomi dropped to third place. By 50 meters, the Polish athlete, Walasiewicz, took the lead, with the German athlete, Julius, in second place, and Hitomi remained in third. It is most unfortunate that the French athlete, Lagadu, who held the previous record, only qualified for fifth place. In the 200-meter semi-final, the Dutch athlete, Schuurman, took the lead from the start, and Hitomi could not catch up, qualifying for second place. In the high jump event, the German athlete, Braumüller, broke the Games record with a height of 1.57 meters. In the 400-meter relay, the English and German teams were the strongest, taking first and second place in their respective groups. The Japanese team took first place in the third group. What Japan most regretted was that Ms. Hitomi was eliminated in the 100-meter semi-final with a time of 13.4 seconds, failing to maintain her world record. With her defeat in the 100 meters, Japan found it difficult to contend for the championship. The audience all lamented Hitomi's unexpected failure.</p>

<p>Small Football Registration Begins: The 5th Small Football Competition organized by the City No. 1 Public Sports Field is scheduled to start registration today and end on the 30th. However, the small football teams are eager to compete, having prepared for nearly a year. In the past two days, there have been several inquiries and registrations. It is predicted that this competition will be more lively than in previous years. It is also heard that the stadium believes that adults are physically stronger and that football training is more suitable for them than small football. Therefore, the "strong men's group" has been removed from this small football competition, leaving only the youth, young athletes, and junior groups.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Friendly Matches: Yesterday was Sunday, and the City No. 1 Public Sports Field was particularly lively with sports activities. In addition to the amateur tennis championship, there were also three friendly football matches. The results are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Small Football: Yongxing beat Youyi B, 1-0</p>

<h3 id="e95">Finance: Gold Prices Trended Soft Last Week <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Trading Was Quiet Throughout the Week: Gold prices were slightly weaker last week, with daily fluctuations of about four to five taels. The price hovered around 560 taels, showing a flat trend. This was due to both buyers and sellers controlling the market as the settlement date approached, to prevent sharp fluctuations. Learning from the past experience of the previous settlement, sellers dared not overextend themselves, and buyers were wary of extending bills of exchange. Therefore, both sides remained cautious. However, market sentiment remained anxious, leading to occasional complex situations. A brief overview of the past week is provided below:</p>
<p>Full Week Down 6.1 Taels: On Monday, September 8, both tael silver and silver prices saw a pullback. Bills of exchange remained unchanged, but the internal dynamics of banks seemed to ease. The initial price for October gold opened at 561.7 taels, then dropped by one tael due to the political turmoil in Japan, causing market sentiment to turn downward. Later, the market stabilized around 60 taels, closing at 61.4 taels in the afternoon, still 0.3 taels lower than the previous Saturday. The next day, the silver market recovered and the exchange rate weakened, causing the gold market to soften. However, there were fluctuations of about six taels, reaching 65.5 taels in the afternoon before retreating to 61 taels as Indian exchange rates recovered and bankers aggressively sold orders. Furthermore, Yuan Mao, Yongfeng, and Cuitai actively sold off their holdings. Wednesday saw a flat market with only three taels of fluctuations. Dealers were unwilling to sell actively, and both buyers and sellers were in a wait-and-see mode, creating a stagnant situation. The market initially rose by over one tael to 62.3 taels in the morning, with tael silver remaining unchanged and silver prices slightly higher. However, internal trends in sterling weakened, and the price reached 63.4 taels before slightly reversing in the afternoon. The market closed at 61.8 taels, 0.8 taels higher than the previous day. Dealers such as Chengfeng and Yongchang bought in, while Bianxinshengda sold. On Thursday, the silver market weakened, but the United States seemed to be selling, causing the gold market to rise. However, trading was scarce and the market was very quiet, with only about two taels of price difference. The market closed at 62.7 taels. The following day saw fluctuations in tael silver, but there was no development overseas and the United States had no intention of buying or selling. The gold market suddenly experienced turmoil, with fluctuations of up to ten taels throughout the day. This was due to the panic caused by the political turmoil in Japan, which made the market fearful. The market was initially flat in the morning, but large investors tended to sell off, breaking the 60-tael mark. Bills of exchange weakened significantly, and companies such as Shengshengda sold off their holdings. The market closed at 52.8 taels in the afternoon, a sharp drop of ten taels compared to the previous day. On Saturday, the silver market recovered, and bills of exchange, which had been weakening since the previous Friday by 1.5 levels, had not changed for seven or eight days. It was not until the previous Saturday (13th) that they were raised by one level, while the gold market tended to stabilize. This was due to the divergent trends in sterling and the fact that banks were settling accounts. With the settlement date approaching, Zhifeng, Yongda, and others were seeking to buy, and market sentiment turned bullish. The market closed at 56.6 taels, an increase of 3.8 taels, and then rose again by over one tael, with fluctuations of about five taels in half a day. Compared to the previous Saturday (6th), it was still down 6.1 taels. The high and low prices for British, American, Indian silver markets, bills of exchange, and gold prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Type  Highest  Lowest  Compared to Last Saturday</p>
<p>Tael Silver (Near)  16 pence 875  11 pence 5625  Up 125</p>
<p>Tael Silver (Far)  16 pence 875  16 pence 5625  Up 125</p>
<p>US Silver Market  $0.36625  $0.3575  Up 0.5 points</p>
<p>Mengmai Market  48 rupees 02  47 rupees 04  Up 13</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate (Sterling)  1 shilling 7 pence 5  1 shilling 7 pence 25  Up 25</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate  $39.05  $59  Up $0.5</p>

<p>Gold Price  565.5 taels  552.8 taels  Down 6.1 taels</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and all Chinese and foreign banks were closed as usual. However, the London telegraph reported that tael silver had fallen again, with both near and far terms down 0.0625 to 16 pence 8125 (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 pence 875 in British gold). A New York telegraph reported that the US silver price had fallen by 0.375 to $0.3625. British against US increased by 0.0625 to $4.86, and US against British rose by 0.125 to $4.8609275. Japanese, American, British, and Indian prices remained unchanged, and the sterling-Shanghai exchange rate remained at 1 shilling 7 pence 875.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the market was typically quiet. The interbank loan rate was 7 qian 3 fen and 0.02 hao for both morning and afternoon markets, the same as the afternoon market on the previous day. Silver loan rate was 1 fen higher, at 6 fen. The morning and afternoon markets were also identical. The morning market saw a clearing of 245,000 yuan in bills and no market for banknotes. The afternoon market saw a clearing of 326,000 yuan in bills and 10,000 yuan in banknotes. The off-market banknote market was 85,000 yuan in the morning and 30,000 yuan in the afternoon. Money shops collected and settled over 2.1 million yuan in silver public bills and over 27 million yuan in foreign public bills. All types of silver and foreign settlements and transactions with banks were closed and there was no news. Transactions of small money shops amounted to over 300,000 yuan. The market for subsidiary coins remained unchanged for Jiangnan small foreign coins at 6 qian 4 fen 7 li. The morning market was the same, with only 2,000 yuan traded in the morning. However, the Guangdong small foreign coins rose sharply again to 6 qian 3 fen 4 li in the morning market and 6 qian 3 fen 5 li in the afternoon market, an increase of 3 li compared to the previous morning market. Transactions totaled 200,000 yuan in the morning market and 85,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 to 388,000 cash.</p>

<p>The trading situation of various public bonds in Shanghai last week was that the spot market continued to be quiet. A total of 88,900 yuan was traded throughout the week, including 46,000 yuan of Reorganization bonds, 14,000 yuan of Customs bonds, 10,000 yuan of Disarmament bonds, and only a few thousand yuan of other bonds. Although the futures market was still good, the market had stagnated. The total turnover for the week, excluding the weekend day, was over 8.6 million yuan, and 9.6 million yuan on Thursday, with the remaining days between 11 and 12 million yuan. The total turnover for the week was 62,925,000 yuan, a decrease of approximately 4.5 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, the Disarmament bonds market performed best, with 10.345 million yuan in September futures and 17.035 million yuan in October futures. Reorganization bonds accounted for 7.98 million yuan in September futures and 11.14 million yuan in October futures. Customs bonds have gradually declined, with 4.34 million yuan in September futures and 5.315 million yuan in October futures. Other bonds remained quiet, such as the 6% Consolidated Bonds, with 685,000 yuan in September futures and 475,000 yuan in October futures; Relief bonds, with 1.325 million yuan in September futures and 1.28 million yuan in October futures; 96 Bonds, with 185,000 yuan in September futures and 155,000 yuan in October futures; Continued Loan Bonds, with 310,000 yuan in September futures and 40,000 yuan in October futures. 7-Year Continued 25 Bonds and Financial Bonds only had September futures traded, with 35,000 yuan in 7-Year Bonds, 30,000 yuan in Continued Great Bonds, and 50,000 yuan in Financial Bonds. The 19th Year Tobacco Bonds saw slightly more trading, with 855,000 yuan in September futures and 1.345 million yuan in October futures. As for the price trend of various bonds over the past week, the bond market remained quiet due to the lack of new developments in the political situation, and major buyers and sellers were in a wait-and-see mode, so bond prices were also stable. The trend is expected to remain stable for the time being without significant rises or falls. The following is a statistical table of the high, low, and change in prices of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e99">Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Very Sluggish Last Week <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market appeared quite uneasy last week, mainly due to the weakness of the global cotton industry and the domestic turmoil caused by widespread warfare and banditry, which severely impacted sales. The stock of unsold goods at various mills continued to increase. According to some sources, it was approximately 150,000 bales. With such a large amount of inventory, it became even more difficult for yarn prices to rise. As a result, the majority of people in the market were bearish. Although the Cantonese traders and certain manufacturers tried their best to purchase, they could not support the market on their own. Therefore, the Cantonese traders had to painfully liquidate their forward contracts, causing even more panic among retail investors. The market had no support, and prices for all months plummeted by over 50 taels. In addition, approximately 160,000-170,000 bales of 20s and 10s Japanese yarn that were previously offered by Japanese mills were mostly accepted by traders and customers who intended to sell them in the autumn. However, due to the poor market environment and the difficulty in selling the yarn, there was a lot of volatility. Therefore, the selling pressure from the Chaozhou traders increased, and the selling price of Japanese yarn continued to decline rapidly. In short, the large inventory, stagnant sales, and unstable political situation were the biggest obstacles to yarn sales. The price of cotton yarn for each month fell by 3 taels compared to the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 114,250 bales. The spot yarn market was even more sluggish. The Sichuan and Tianjin traders bought a lot of futures. The total amount of spot and futures purchased by various traders for the week was 9,761 bales, and the amount of yarn traded among peers was 2,950 bales. The price of Japanese yarn fell by 2-3 taels. The following is a breakdown of the amount purchased by each trader:</p>
<p>Trader  Bales  Trader  Bales  Inland  1,200  Hankou  90  Tianjin  3,280  Qingdao  110  Luzhou  215  Zhenjiang  105  Sichuan  3,405  Miscellaneous  445  Yunnan  81  Nanjing  100  Xuzhou  325  Jiangxi  85  Peers  2,950  Nanyang  320</p>
<h3 id="e100">Cotton Market Remains Pessimistic Last Week <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remained pessimistic in reality. The US government's second estimate was still favorable for short positions, causing the market to decline. The global situation was difficult to turn around in the short term. Due to the relatively poor weather, domestic merchants saw that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had suffered considerable damage from the continuous rain and came to Shanghai to purchase long positions. Surface traders took the opportunity to buy and turn long, temporarily seeing a positive trend to scalp. However, as soon as the weather cleared, Hubei Province had a great year, and Hankou traders sold off. Despite the surge in US cotton, they were still unable to reverse the trend. Although the surface traders' intentions were firm, they could not save the situation and prices fell again. However, the number of chips in the market was less than before. It is estimated that about 40,000-50,000 dan were purchased from Wuxi and other inland areas around Shanghai and are not willing to release them for the time being. If foreign cotton does not rise and the new cotton business does not start, they will eventually spit it out, leading to a big change. In addition, Indian cotton is taking the opportunity to sneak in. Spot cotton transactions at various mills were sluggish, and both Chinese and foreign manufacturers were not interested. This is because Indian cotton is full and there is no need to purchase it at present. The price of spot flowers for each month fell by 3, 4, and 5 qian compared to the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 283,700 dan. The statistics of spot cotton transactions purchased by various mills were 15,680 dan, and the statistics of the amount of yarn purchased by brokers were 5,120 dan. 7,700 bales of Yao flowers and 392 bales of Tong flowers arrived at the pier. US cotton fell by 55 pounds compared to the previous week. The following is a breakdown of the amount purchased by manufacturers and brokers:</p>

<h3 id="e102">Grains: The River Lower Rice Market Continues to Be Flat and Weak <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, only a few boats arrived from inland areas, and river stocks were extremely low. However, the stocks in factory warehouses were better than market sales. Due to the clear weather, market sentiment was still weak. Northern Traders: There was a shortage of broken rice, and the market was flat. Top-quality rice was particularly strong, priced at 20 yuan and 78 jiao. Medium-quality japonica rice was slightly trimmed, and large wholesale orders were slightly better, mainly because both stocks and arrivals were low, and transactions were normal. Dozens of shi of Western new japonica rice continued to arrive, but it was ordinary goods from the Central Plains, so the price was only 19 and a half yuan. Top-quality goods were still priced at 20 yuan. Although there was a source of Eastern new japonica rice from outside the customs, most of it was in the hands of rice mill traders, so very few were sold. The market initially tried to maintain a high price, but buyers were not greedy and the price was flat, similar to the previous day. However, it is feared that the price outside the market will have to go downstream. New sheep-tip rice opened high at 15 yuan, with a slight difference of 1-2 jiao. This type of market seems difficult to stand, and a large batch will arrive later. New guest-tip rice was also weak, down 2-3 jiao, and buying interest waned. Top-quality goods gradually approached 14 yuan, and ordinary goods were all around 13 and a half yuan. Both the arrival and sales of Bian Yuan were weak, and there was still no increase or decrease.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: There were very few arrivals from the river, and the market was flat and weak. Only medium and low-quality broken japonica rice was on the market, and top-quality goods were missing. Therefore, the price barely opened at 19 yuan and 78 jiao. South Traders: The sales of thin rice were limited, and there were very few arrivals. The market price was still hovering around 20 yuan and 89 jiao. There were very few sources of Eastern new japonica rice this time, and the price followed the Northern market. Although new japonica rice arrived in the South, the demand in this street was not smooth, and the price remained the same. Arrivals of sheep-tip new-tip rice were scarce, and the market was flat and weak. White Yuan has been short of arrivals for days. Even if there were a few scattered goods, sales were not strong, so the market was sluggish.</p>

<p>In recent days, the weather has been cool, and the transaction of woolen fabrics has increased accordingly. The retail business of stores in this street has gradually become prosperous. Tailors of Western-style clothing have also seen a sharp increase in customers ordering suits. The guild for bulk goods and bundled materials continues to open, and the market sentiment remains excellent. Wide and narrow striped and plain camel hair has been selling particularly well recently, and various businesses on this street have seen substantial transactions. Fair Price &amp; Virtue Brand and Rongtai Brand are uniformly sold at 2 taels and 2 maces and 5 candareens per piece. Selecting colors requires an additional 5%. Plain-colored Tianxiang is 1 tael and 9 maces, Ningfeng is 1 tael and 5 maces, and domestically produced goods from this factory are all sold at 1 tael and 6 maces and 5 candareens. Striped fabrics are sold at 2 taels and 2 maces. No. 2 goods are 2 taels. Hongfa and Wei Yi, the lowest quality, are 1 tael and 8 maces and 5 candareens.</p>

<p>Since the market of small tacks ranging from 3 to 6 fen declined after the arrival of Yuan Liao, the market sentiment has been quite robust. In recent days, the Dalian group has been purchasing in large quantities, and the Hankou group has also been involved. Therefore, the market supply has become insufficient, and the standard price has risen sharply. Currently, 3-fen tacks can be sold for 12 taels and 2 maces and 5 candareens per barrel, 4-fen for 11 taels and 2 maces and 5 candareens, 5-fen for 11 taels, and 6-fen for 9 taels. It has been observed that the trade in glass products on this street has also been discussed recently. Therefore, commonly traded varieties such as 3-fen, 4-fen, and 5-fen are in very short supply. It is rumored that the latest overseas prices are very robust. However, due to the significant difference between the purchase price and the market price, businesses are not purchasing them, and the market may see further price increases.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A—Recent newspapers have made much progress. In addition to many daily news items, there are also categories such as education and sports. But why do I often see an empty space?</p>
<p>B—Oh, that's because there's too much material. The characters are packed so tightly everywhere, so they deliberately open a window to let in some air.</p>
<p>Teacher—Children, we all know that the Earth is round, but you must provide me with three pieces of evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>Student—Sir, you said the Earth is round, my father also said the Earth is round, and my mother also said the Earth is round. Those are three pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Girl A—What do you think Mr. D means? He comes to see me every night and is very affectionate with me.</p>
<p>Girl B—As I see it, perhaps it's because he loves you, or perhaps it's because he has no dinner at home.</p>
<p>A—I've recently embraced hedonism and want to be comfortable in every way, so I specially installed a bell on my bed the other day so I can ring it as soon as I open my eyes every morning.</p>
<p>B—In that case, how many servants do you employ at home?</p>
<p>A—All the housework is still done by my old mother. I just installed a bell.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Liu Weizhi Plans to Transform Model Railways <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>Western countries have always valued transportation, and railway engineering is vast. A characteristic is that structures such as roofs and tunnels are built over railways, and trains run safely. The sophistication of their construction and the convenience of transportation are sufficient for our country to emulate. My country's railways currently only total more than 7,000 miles. Due to the influence of civil war and the lack of capital, their equipment is still relatively simple, and transportation is not entirely smooth. It is difficult to compare with Europe and the United States. However, looking at the national railways, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have been less affected by military affairs, so they are slightly better than other lines. The current director of the two railway administrations, Liu Weizhi, once studied in the United States and has long been engaged in railway affairs. Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways appointed Liu as the director of the ministry's business department and concurrently oversaw the affairs of the two railway administrations. Since taking office, Liu has actively reorganized railway administration. In addition to handling routine official duties, he often takes time to browse books on railway construction and research various improvement plans, intending to use his strengths to turn the two lines into national model railways to serve as examples for other railways and increase the convenience of transportation in the capital. His plan is indeed very grand. Liu often told me about this, strongly emphasizing the necessity of transforming model railways and hoping to achieve his goals. Liu Juheng works diligently and rises early in the morning to go to the bureau on time. However, the Ministry of Railways is in Beijing, and the railway administration is in Shanghai. Liu must travel back and forth for official business, spending roughly half the week in Shanghai and half the week in Beijing. He travels frequently and spends two nights a week sleeping on the train, living his sleeping life on the train. Yet Liu shows no sign of fatigue, as he is accustomed to traveling and considers the distance between Beijing and Shanghai not far, taking the train as if taking a streetcar.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Strange Tales from Central Henan <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>I have already published an article in this column about the suffering of the people in Central Henan. Now, I have heard that two monsters appeared in the southwest of Henan Province last month. The villagers believed they were divine messengers and were all panicked and did not know what to do. I will describe them below to show a glimpse of the recent situation of the people of Henan.</p>
<p>Nine Rats with One Tail: In the southwest of Henan Province, there is a small town. The person who mentioned it did not specify its name. A certain Mr. So-and-so in the town was sitting idly in the living room of his house one day when he suddenly felt something fall from the beam, hitting his foot. Mr. So-and-so was startled and looked at it, and it was a rat's nest. The young rats in the nest were wriggling, as if they were rats trying to escape after being shaken by the fall. Mr. So-and-so usually hated rats, so he stepped on the nest. The rats in the nest wailed incessantly, as if they could not bear the pain. Mr. So-and-so then lifted his foot, and the rats in the nest emerged. There were about five or six rats, staggering as they walked. Mr. So-and-so, being injured and unable to walk well, did not find it strange and then struck them with a club. All the rats died. Looking at them, there were six rats in total, but only one tail. The six rats were connected as one, so they moved clumsily. Mr. So-and-so was greatly shocked and told his neighbors. The neighbors came to watch and exclaimed in surprise. The elderly even took this as an ominous sign, saying that there would soon be a great flood or famine. For a time, the news spread far and wide, and everyone was anxiously thinking that disaster was about to strike, and they did not know what to do.</p>
<p>Dragon Head in Well: There are many wells in the countryside of Henan Province, and the residents rely on them for drinking water. There is often a pulley next to the well to draw water, so as to save time and effort. When the story of the nine rats with one tail was spreading among the people, suddenly a neighboring town also made a big commotion about a strange thing. A certain household in the town had a well and also used a pulley to draw water. One day, the owner went to the well to draw water and pulled the pulley by hand, but it would not move. Thinking that there was damage between the pulleys, he gathered his neighbors to pull it together, but it still would not move, and the pulley was unbearably heavy, as if something was holding it in the well. They could not help but look at each other in dismay. Everyone let go and waited for a change. The pulley then automatically drew water and splashed water from the well as if it were very high. After a long time, suddenly a strange head emerged from the well. Everyone shouted in fear, and the monster disappeared and could not be seen again. Everyone then told each other what they had seen, and everyone said in unison that it had horns, a beard, and yellow spots, and it was clearly a dragon's head.</p>

<p>Yang Zhenqing from Xiaoshan graduated from higher primary school and is now employed in a certain silk shop in Hangzhou. He usually admires the revolution and worships President Sun. Since President Sun's death, he has mourned for three days and nights, almost neglecting food and sleep. He especially loves to read President Sun's posthumous work, the Three Principles of the People. Whenever the night is quiet and all sounds are still, he often holds a volume and silently recites it by the light, never missing an evening. Recently, he has become well-versed in the entire book and can recite it completely in two hours in one breath, which is quite pleasant to listen to. In his spare time, he often lectures on the Three Principles of the People, eloquently and tirelessly. Those who see him admire him without exception, and it is spread as a good story for a time.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Visiting Old Friends in Xuyuan <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Butterflies are said to be transformed from the clothes left by Ge Hong, because they are light and ethereal among insects, wanting to become immortals and being naturally rich in literary talent. My predecessor, Tianxu Wusheng, had the surname Chen and the courtesy name Diexian, so he took the meaning of Zhuangzi's "fluttering butterfly" and named his residence Xuyuan. It is said that the old site of Xuyuan is in the south of Shanghai, but I have not been there. My younger brother Runsun moved with his mother from Qiaojia浜 in the south of the city to No. 1 Sanle Lane on Jingxiu Road in the West Gate. The lane is very short and secluded, with very few people passing by. My younger brother's residence is No. 1, facing south. There is also No. 2, facing west. There is no third house. I heard from my neighbor that this residence used to be a tooth powder factory. It was first in the No. 2 house, and then it moved to the No. 1 house. Now it has established a company and the business is very prosperous. I have always suspected that it was the birthplace of Tianxu Wusheng's industry, but I have not dared to confirm it. This Sunday, I entered the city to visit my mother. In the evening, I was taking a nap in front of the door when I suddenly saw a large brick embedded in the courtyard wall of the adjacent No. 2 house. The words "Xuyuan" were chiseled in large characters, with jade-like luster and roundness, and the calligraphy was perfect. Only then did I know that this was indeed the old residence of Tianxu Wusheng. It is a pity that the crude and ignorant have smeared and defaced the brick text, adding vulgar words such as "Prosperity to me." Thus, the wall is like a scab. My younger brother's residence is also where Tianxu Wusheng used to live and sing, which makes people imagine a family of elegant and artistic people.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ricebird and Scarecrow <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Among birds, there are ricebirds that love to eat ripening rice grains. When it is the seventh month in the countryside, the leaves of the trees are slightly shed, and the new grains turn yellow. The long ears droop, and the sap condenses into grains. Then, hundreds of ricebirds gather in the fields, chirping and eating, happily spending their golden age. When people come to chase them away, they fly away, but when the people leave, they fly back and chirp. Therefore, the farmers suffer from it and can do nothing. Some people tie straw into a human shape to scare them. The scarecrow wears a straw hat, short clothes, and holds a long stick in its hand, looking like a farmer. Also, because it cannot stand upright, they insert a fishing rod into the field ridge and hang the scarecrow on the wheel hook, and under the scarecrow, they also hang two stones. When the ricebirds see it, they indeed think it is a person and dare not come. When I saw it, I laughed and thought it was just superficial work, and the swallows and sparrows would eventually be easily deceived. However, I did not know the intention of hanging two stones under the scarecrow, so I took away the two stones for them. Then, the west wind blew, and the scarecrow moved automatically, its clothes turned over, and the straw came out, revealing its true form. However, I did not pay attention to this at first. Then, ricebirds passed by and gathered at a distance to stare at it. After looking at it carefully for a long time, as if they realized that the scarecrow was fake, some of them gradually went down into the fields. After a while, those who came thought there was no danger, and those who had not come also gathered. Then the scarecrow's scare effect was completely lost. At this point, I realized that the reason for hanging two stones under the scarecrow was to prevent it from fluttering and showing its true form to people. From then on, the scarecrows in our village could no longer be relied on to intimidate ricebirds. Sometimes, ricebirds gathered on the scarecrow's body, chirping and fighting, and bird droppings fell like a group of people ridiculing the scarecrow. Ah, scarecrow!</p>
<h3 id="e111">Record of the Cricket <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>With one leaf falling in Dongting Lake, autumn returns to the earth, and autumn dominates killing. Those who obtain its energy are crickets. People use their fighting nature and take it as a recreational activity. They beautify its name as "Autumn Interest," which can also be said to be a good thing.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of crickets. Most ordinary ones are named according to their shape and color. However, their advantages and disadvantages, strength and weakness, also depend on the size of their shape and the difference in color. Often, an extremely ordinary shape and body can defeat those with extraordinary shapes and bodies. This cannot be distinguished without being old in this art and being a skilled appraiser. In my hometown, there is a certain Mr. Jia who keeps hundreds of crickets every autumn. Last autumn, he obtained an insect with a short and sharp body and a uniquely large head. At first, he did not think it was very special and despised it. After raising it for a long time and using it for fighting, it was surprisingly fierce and invincible. Half of the hundreds of insects he had were defeated by it. Before fighting, its antennae were straight and its appearance was very quiet. When fighting, its head and horns rose up, and its legs were like lances against the enemy. After being touched, it was repelled, its wings were broken, and it did not dare to face it. Mr. Jia did not know why it was like this at first. After several careful inspections, he realized that the reason for its victory was the strength of its head. So, he recognized it as a hero and placed it in an expensive container and carefully fed it, calling it "Locomotive" to symbolize its sharpness and ferocity. However, because of its body weight, it was difficult to find a match for it when choosing a partner. Mr. Jia used it in fighting matches and often used it to fight against insects that were twice its weight, even insects that were three times as large. In this battle, at the beginning of the fight between the two insects, the Locomotive was thrown onto the fence top because its strength was not enough. Everyone thought it would definitely lose, but unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, the one three times its weight suddenly fell into the fence gap, and the one shouting wildly was the Locomotive. It turns out that after the Locomotive was thrown out, the other one was about to stretch its legs and rub its antennae to show its victory. The Locomotive took the opportunity to jump into its abdomen, attacking its weakness, and used its head and horns to hit its tail, causing it to be thrown out. This can be said to be good at using intelligence. The enemy then stroked its antennae again to try to decide the outcome again, but the insect had its legs suppressed and its tail damaged and could not fight. Then the victory was decided. It was heard that the Locomotive was obtained under a mulberry root. When Mr. Jia caught it, he first encountered a red snake and thought it had moved elsewhere. When he passed by the place again, the sound was still there. He poured water into it and then obtained it. It can also be said to be a miracle. Mr. Jia relied on it to make several thousand dollars, because it was invincible and always won. Later, it was heard that it was resold to someone in Jiangyin, and the price was 2,000 gold coins.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The car arrived at the Guan Yin Temple in Kuala Lumpur. Next to it was the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall, which was large in scale. It is common for people overseas to organize themselves by clan to enhance their family's reputation. This practice is most prevalent in Guangdong, but it is especially necessary overseas. It is feared that as methods of collective organization progress, there may be gradual changes. The method of forming groups and the visit to the Jingwu Athletic Association for men included various Chinese and Western musical instruments, various weapons, and affiliated schools and newspaper reading rooms.</p>
<p>An employee, Mr. Huang, was asked whether Westerners were members of Jingwu. He replied that due to the issue of ethnicity, foreigners were not allowed to learn our martial arts. We also visited the women's section. The director, Ms. Feng, has been here for nine years. The new building is far superior to the one in Singapore, being spacious and grand. Outside the gate, the bamboo forest is well-maintained. Ms. Feng asked me about Kunhua. I replied that the suffering of human reproduction is entirely borne by mothers, while males use it to go shooting. In the future, women around the world should unite. If males want to start a major war, it must be approved by women around the world who are wives and mothers. This is one way to correct the practice of war. On that day, it was a holiday and all the agencies were closed, and no one could be visited. It is said that Kuala Lumpur is the center of the four states of Selangor. Among the hundreds of thousands of Chinese, there are two middle schools, one is Zun Kong and the other is Kun Cheng. There are many primary schools and dozens of groups. There are Guangxi provincial groups, which are not found in Singapore.</p>
<p>I took the train to Baling. The train seemed low, not as good as the Chinese trains. A third-class ticket to Ba Shuang Harbor cost four jiao per person. Workers sold food next to the train, and there were also Chinese people selling Shanghai's Liangyou magazine. The ship returned at 2 o'clock, and the passengers boarded after 4 o'clock. There were many Malays and Indians, filling the deck, but I was the only one in second class. It was hot, so the breeze on the deck was cool. But I felt that the problem of bread was secondary in Southeast Asia, and the first was showering to reduce body heat. Therefore, I sat in second class to be able to shower freely. This proves that those who believe in Marx's idea that bread is the only problem in life are wrong.</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Tears Stain, Beauty's Heart is Broken; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Using the name of doing business and socializing with friends to engage in the business of seeking pleasure is a major topic for those in Shanghai who frequent prostitutes. It seems that this business cannot be done without eating, drinking, and whoring. Generally, they hold this kind of excuse for their own spouses, whether it is their principal wife, concubine, or temporary mistress. Their female counterparts also know the economic principle that the source of financial income relies entirely on the head of the household. In order for him to earn money to support the family's extravagant spending, they naturally have to be lenient with him. Therefore, that woman, Zhang Yiqing, does not prohibit him from whoring, but the three chapters of the agreement have already been stipulated. His notice is similar to the Shanghai Municipal Council banning theaters and playgrounds, only effective until 12 o'clock at night. He must check in before 12 o'clock. Although his wife's 12 o'clock is like the 12 o'clock in the daytime of ordinary people, which is the center of the day, because she is treating liver pain and has become addicted to opium, she gets up at six or seven o'clock every evening and only goes to sleep when it is almost dawn. It doesn't matter if their master returns a little later, but she seems to be under strict marital guidance and must have a rule. Zhang Yiqing ultimately feels that this rule restricts people's freedom too much. To struggle in this harsh rule, the only way is to use the "teasing" method. Sometimes she says she has gone somewhere, sometimes she is held back by friends. By this, she can be pardoned for one night or two nights. Only after he obtained the good job of comprador of the Yangtze River steamboat could it be said that he had obtained liberation and freedom. He said that according to the company's regulations, all senior compradores must travel with the ship at least once a month. As for junior compradores, it is even more necessary to travel. Since he has become a senior comprador, he cannot but obey the company's regulations. His wife has no choice but to let him do so. He also brings back some Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan specialties every time to please her. Therefore, at first, Hankou was his hunting ground, and then gradually he was liberated to Shanghai. At home, he only says that the comprador has boarded the ship and the ship has already sailed. In fact, he doesn't know that he is hiding in a small house somewhere. That house may be smaller than a ship. All the Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan specialties can be brought back by others. Even if the comprador doesn't board the ship, the benefits can still be distributed. Therefore, he has the courage to take Cuiyun as a concubine. Fortunately, the people who accompany him are all helping him, and some people have been instructed in advance. Originally, his matter of occupying a friend's wife was not public among many fellow villagers, but more than half of them already knew about it. However, everyone has their own secrets and their own ulterior motives. No one will expose anyone else. Some people even have requests for him, so they naturally help him say good things.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Municipal Propaganda Department's Statement Regarding the Price Increase of Water in the Foreign Concessions <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department issued a statement to the public regarding the unprovoked price increase of tap water in the Public Concession, stating: "Tap water is one of the public utilities. Therefore, in European and American countries, these public utilities are all operated by the state, and the prices charged to users are very low. The purpose is to facilitate the citizens rather than to make profits. Since the opening of China to foreign trade, we have been bound by the unequal treaties of various imperialist countries. Our country has no say in all the administrative matters within the concessions. As for the recent forced price increase by the Shanghai Waterworks Company, the Municipal Council, which bears the administrative responsibility for the concession, approved it in disregard of the people's livelihood. From this one incident, it can be seen that their collusion is truly outrageous. Moreover, the price of tap water in the concession was originally calculated based on 6% of the house price. In recent years, house prices in Shanghai have risen year by year, and the company's income has increased invisibly a lot. Now there is even an increase to 25%, an unreasonable oppression that is intolerable. At this time of difficult living, all our citizens must unite and oppose the price increase. We vow not to pay until the goal is achieved. On the one hand, we must recognize that imperialists oppress our people in every possible way. In order to seek the root cause, we must unite to assist the government to recover the concessions in the shortest possible time. I hope you will take these matters into consideration."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee received Instruction No. 165 from the Provincial Reorganization Committee yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the previous instructions from the Central Executive Committee to guide people's organizations to initiate the Northern Expedition Comfort Donation, etc., we ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Propaganda Committee and notified the party departments of various counties to comply. It has been a long time since then, but the number of counties that have raised donations and submitted them to the committee is still very small. We should actively handle them to emphasize the law and benefit the suppression of rebels. In addition to issuing orders separately, we hereby order the party department to immediately investigate and handle the previous orders and report back without delay. This order."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Central Training Department Directive: Postpone the Cancellation of Trade Unions <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department's Mass Training Committee previously received a request from more than 20 trade unions in the city, such as the calligraphy, painting, paper fan, and stationery industries, to confirm the organization of trade unions. It was submitted to the Central Training Department for review and instructed the unions to notify them. This news was published in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Shenmin Training Committee has received Directive No. 10635 from the Central Training Department, which reads: "Regarding the request from the calligraphy, painting, paper fan, and stationery trade unions, etc., to confirm the organization of trade unions, and the attached original and duplicate submissions from the trade unions, etc., please review and indicate compliance. I have carefully reviewed the submissions. Regarding the question of whether trade unions should continue to exist, the members of the committee previously came to the ministry to present everything in person, and the minister instructed to postpone the cancellation. All requests from the calligraphy, painting, paper fan, and stationery trade unions, etc., to confirm the organization of trade unions should still be handled in accordance with the previous instructions. This order."</p>
<h3 id="e117">Continuing to Request the Collection of Fees for Dredging Yutang <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Yutang Dredging Preparatory Committee submitted a document to the Shanghai County Government and the Construction Bureau yesterday, stating: "We respectfully report that the funds required for dredging Yutang have been resolved by the council through land tax collection. Instruction No. 6 from your bureau stated that the request for land tax collection was approved. However, the area of tax collection and the amount of tax collection per mu were not stated in detail, which seemed vague. A detailed response should be provided before further review. This order, etc., was received. In the midst of handling this, we received Instruction No. 290 from your government, which stated that the case had been submitted to the 34th county government meeting for discussion and it was decided that if the land tax collection exceeded the limit, the local people should devise other methods and prepare a detailed budget to be submitted to the county for review and filing. We should comply with this order. This order, etc., was received. We then submitted it to the 7th preparatory meeting for discussion and resolved that the dredging of the river was a profit-generating undertaking and was different from the nature of ordinary mu donations. Moreover, the burden was only on the farmers on both banks of Yutang who were related to water conservancy and not on all the people in the county uniformly. Moreover, the funds were a temporary levy, so we should not abandon the effort because of the provincial quota. The council should prepare a budget and continue to request review, etc. We then discussed how to stipulate the method of tax collection and decided to collect in two installments. The first installment was to collect 1 jiao per mu in the winter rice tax of the 19th year. The second installment was to collect 5 fen in the busy season silver tax of the 20th year, etc. It is on file that Yutang is a major transportation river connecting Songjiang and Shanghai counties, extending 27 li from east to west. The commerce and transportation of the three towns of Beitang and Matang rely on this river. The irrigation of farmland along the river reaches more than 54,000 mu. Recently, due to years of disrepair, it has become increasingly silted up, and the irrigation of farmland will be cut off, and the transportation of boats will be hindered. This is the biggest reason for the decline in agricultural production and the depression of commerce. At this time of political training and construction, increasing production and developing people's livelihood are the biggest tasks of local self-government agencies. The council, in view of this, collected the opinions of local people and adapted to the needs of farmers along the river. Although it knew that the land tax collection exceeded the limit, it was permissible for the farmers to endure the pain for a time to reap endless benefits. It seems that we do not need to stick to it. Moreover, the tax collection is only limited to the farmland on both banks along the river, not all the people in the county uniformly bear it. The public unanimously agreed. It is reasonable to prepare a detailed budget and the method of tax collection and submit them to your superiors for review and approval. We respectfully request that your superiors review and quickly forward them to the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department for approval to collect taxes to benefit river works and increase agricultural production."</p>

<h3 id="e119">Disappointment Regarding Autumn Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Significant Losses for the Silk Industry</p>
<p>This year, the estimated yield of autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was expected to be around 60,000 piculs. Unexpectedly, due to weather conditions, the harvest has been greatly disappointing, and the quality is extremely poor. Wuxi has already started weighing the cocoons, and the worst quality requires 3,600 to 3,700 catties of fresh cocoons to produce 100 catties of silk. Even the best quality cocoons require more than 2,700 catties. Silk factories in Shanghai that had not yet set out to purchase autumn cocoons are now canceling their rental agreements with cocoon farmers. The farmers, aware of the poor quality, are eager to sell their cocoons even at a reduced price of 20 to 30 yuan per picul, but manufacturers are hesitant to buy. A silk merchant in Xiyi (Wuxi) bought them at 20 yuan per picul to test the silk reeling, but the result was also a loss, so he has stopped purchasing. Xiejiao in Zhejiang opened its weighing scales the other day with an initial price of 55 yuan per picul. Seeing that 800 to 900 catties were required for silk reeling, the price dropped to 40 yuan, but there are still concerns about maintaining the market. As for cocoons in areas such as Linping in Hangzhou, they also require more than 830 catties for silk reeling. Silk factories are eager to cancel their rental agreements to avoid further losses. Purchasers in areas like Changan are hesitant and cautious about opening their scales. Overall, this year's silk cocoon situation in China is such that the shortage of raw materials in the spring and summer led to soaring cocoon prices. This was simultaneously affected by the price drops in Japanese silk and the stagnation of sales in the American market, causing significant losses for all silk factories. They had hoped for a bountiful autumn cocoon harvest to make up for the losses, but the outcome is the opposite. Therefore, all manufacturers are sighing and frowning in despair.</p>

<p>Held at the YMCA</p>
<p>Since the implementation of raw silk inspection in this port, many silk merchants have a deep understanding of the inspection methods, while others have doubts and cannot understand them. The Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau plans to explain the various methods to silk merchants and to promote the improvement of silk production and attention to foreign trade research. Therefore, it has organized a raw silk inspection lecture series, which is scheduled to begin today at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, the director will deliver an opening speech, followed by Miao Zhongxiu's lecture on a general discussion of raw silk inspection. The afternoon will be a practical session. The bureau has also published a special issue on raw silk inspection in Volume 7 of the "International Trade Guide" to clarify raw silk inspection. Chief technicians and others have written in detail about the various inspection methods. The publication is scheduled to be released on October 1st.</p>

<p>At 10:20 AM yesterday, Zhu Hanbo, a Chinese detective from the Harbin Police Department, learned that someone was illegally selling firearms in the Xinglong Hotel, number 84 Nansun Road.

<h3 id="e130">Yesterday's Disturbance at the Shandong Guild Hall <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai has always been a gathering place for merchants and people from all provinces. Generally, each province has established public offices and guild halls to unite regional friendships and handle public welfare and charitable undertakings. Yesterday afternoon, about six to seven hundred Shandong merchants and business people gathered at the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road in the French Concession. They questioned the guild committee members, including Jiang, Li, and Zhang, about why the credit directory had not been published for the past two years. Due to personal disputes, the guild had repeatedly been involved in lawsuits and had arbitrarily misused public funds. This time, Shandong merchants and business people intended to borrow space from the guild hall for charitable activities such as providing materials and medicine, but they were rejected by the committee members. It seems that such a large public guild hall is controlled by a few committee members. Therefore, they jointly raised questions. The two sides argued and there was some disturbance.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Hu Lianquan of Chuanshan Township Initiates the Construction of the Chuanshan Guild Hall <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Chuanshan Town, which belongs to Zhenhai County in Zhejiang Province, is the main gateway for Yan, Tai, and Hai townships of the county, as well as Xie South and Xie North townships of Dinghai County. Tens of thousands of Chuanshan natives reside in Shanghai, many of whom are prominent businessmen. In the past, Chuanshan natives returning to their hometown had to detour through Ningbo. Even coffins of the deceased had to be transported from Shanghai to Ningbo and then collected by the Siming Public Office in Ningbo for return to Chuanshan. However, this process took a year, and if the family of the deceased did not claim the coffin within the time limit, the public office would rebury it in the Yishan cemetery, which was extremely inconvenient. Since the establishment of direct shipping between Shanghai and Chuanshan, transportation has become more convenient, eliminating the need to detour through Ningbo. However, the transportation of coffins still followed the previous practice. Hu Lianquan, a native of Chuanshan residing in Shanghai, witnessed this situation and initiated the construction of the Chuanshan Guild Hall to allow the families of poor Chuanshan natives in Shanghai to directly transport coffins back to their hometown, which would be both convenient and cost-saving. However, this matter is significant, and Mr. Hu believes that it cannot be accomplished without the collective effort of everyone. Therefore, he drafted a plan and sent a letter to the Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association for assistance. After receiving the letter, the association invited Mr. Hu to the association at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the way forward. It is reported that the discussion was very satisfactory. The association will organize a meeting of Chuanshan natives this Sunday (September 21st) to discuss the plans. It is expected that the Chuanshan natives will care about their hometown and will not hesitate to contribute to the success of the project to benefit the poor natives in the transportation and storage of coffins.</p>

<p>Danyang: The Danyang Shanghai Native Place Association, concerned about the rampant banditry in their hometown, held an emergency meeting yesterday and resolved to urgently telegraph the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request the dispatch of a large army to suppress the bandits. The original telegram is as follows (titles omitted): "In the Puou Village area, which borders Tuhua County in western Danyang, a group of bandits numbering 500 or more have gathered and are burning, killing, robbing, and causing extreme chaos. The people are fleeing in droves, and the area is in imminent danger. At this time, when the new grain is being harvested, the problem of food for the people is of great importance. If this is allowed to spread and cause disturbances, not only will one county or city suffer, but the neighboring provinces and the capital will also be affected, disrupting public order and causing future troubles. Our association, concerned about our hometown, cannot remain silent. We urgently request Your Excellency to quickly dispatch a large army to suppress the bandits to quell the unrest and reassure the people. The Danyang Shanghai Native Place Association, with urgent anticipation."</p>

(3) It has been secretly reported that certain factories are throwing small scraps of worthless paper to disrupt the market and harm the business of others. How should this be prevented to maintain international credit and protect the interests of the industry? It was resolved that (A) the matter should be kept confidential, (B) the Inspection Bureau should be asked to pay attention to the inspection of small scraps of salted sausage for export, and (C) foreign merchants across the country should be notified to be careful when purchasing small scraps of sausage.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Dahua Factory Submits Proposal to Adopt National Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Dahua Factory submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Education stating: "We are submitting a proposal to promote the use of domestically produced woolen fabrics and serge. Recently, with gold becoming more valuable and silver becoming cheaper, the price of all imported daily necessities has increased several times, further impoverishing the people. Therefore, those with aspirations are competing to promote national products and promote industry, which is fundamental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our factory is also a member of the nation, and our patriotism is always at the forefront. Therefore, we have always been meticulous in research and diligent in management. We have organized the Dahua Woolen and Linen Factory to purchase the latest machinery to produce various serge and linen for making ceremonial clothes and casual wear. In this time of rising prices and declining people's livelihood, we are especially willing to do our best to meet the needs of society and not consider personal interests. However, the people are either accustomed to extravagance or limited by their knowledge, and even if there are good domestic products, they do not know to use them, causing money to flow out of the country, weakening the country and impoverishing the people. Thinking of this, we can only sigh. We believe that the late Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood is to revitalize industry and encourage domestic products to cultivate the wealth and strength of the country. The Ministries adhere to the late Premier's teachings and take into account the current difficulties, and will certainly be happy to promote anything that can benefit the country and the people. Therefore, if domestic woolen and linen serge are used for official and private clothing to set an example, the influence from above will be swift, and a patriotic spirit will be cultivated and promoted, which will have a significant effect. Furthermore, the Ministry of Military Affairs has recently purchased a large quantity of woolen materials to make military uniforms and has used as much of our factory's products as possible. Therefore, we boldly submit samples for your inspection and request that you promote and encourage their use, and order all offices and national institutions to uniformly use domestic woolen and linen serge to make official and private clothing. Not only will this be our private wish, but it will also benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Education."</p>

<p>Swallows Snakes and Eats Live Chickens</p>
<p>Hosted by the Shanghai Daily News</p>
<p>Usually Eats Bark, Rats, Frogs, and Flies</p>
<p>Strange Habits of Mountain Dwellers</p>
<p>New Research in Physiology</p>
<p>The strange youth, Sato Tomiji, is from Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. He is currently 27 years old. He lost his mother at a young age and was supported by his uncle, but eventually, he grew tired of it and left to live in the mountains. Initially, he ate grass, trees, and leaves, but then he began to enjoy snakes, rats, and frogs. Over time, it became a habit and he became different from ordinary people. Years ago, he traveled to Taiwan, Korea, and Manchuria. On July 9th of this year, he arrived in Dalian and praised the Dalian leaves as sweeter and more delicious than those in other places. At that time, local people were surprised and hospitals conducted research, causing a sensation. On the 12th of this month, he arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru and stayed at the Yachiyo Hotel on Wusong Road. He told people about it, and many were skeptical. The next day, the Shanghai Daily News gathered dozens of people and invited him to the auditorium. He devoured a live snake and a chicken in front of everyone. He held the snake's head and tail with both hands and bit it in the middle, discarding the tail and eating to the head. He first broke the neck of the live chicken and drank its blood, then ate the meat. Everyone was amazed. The next day, the reporter encountered Mr. Sato on the street and bought thirteen snakes as food. In the morning, he caught flies for breakfast when he was hungry. This is also sufficient for new research in physiology.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Posing as Veterans to Solicit Donations for Wounded Soldiers <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Scheme Exposed</p>
<p>Four People Apprehended</p>
<p>For days, individuals resembling discharged soldiers in groups of three to five have been appearing at the Qichang Pier and along the Huangpu River in Pudong. They solicit donations from people, claiming that a large number of wounded soldiers from the front lines will soon be transported back to Shanghai and housed in the Yu Jia Temple in Pudong. However, a large sum of money is needed to accommodate them. They claim to have been ordered by their superiors to solicit donations from philanthropists so that arrangements can be made in advance. Otherwise, there will inevitably be trouble in the area. The shipping agents and foremen at the piers, moved by their eloquent words, readily donated several or more than ten dollars and gave the solicitors a business card of the "Commander Li Qingsheng" as a receipt. Yesterday morning at 8 AM, they went to the pier to solicit donations again. Someone noticed the loophole and secretly reported it to the Third Team of the Qichang Pier Yangjing District Defense Corps. Team members were dispatched to investigate. When they realized they were exposed, they fled west. Four people were apprehended near Lujiadu and brought to the Corps headquarters before being sent to the Third District of the Public Security Bureau. One of them, Chen Jingbiao, 32 years old, from Xushuguan, Suzhou, stated that he was formerly a first-class soldier in the Eleventh Company, Third Battalion, Eighteenth Regiment, Ninth Brigade, Third Division. He was discharged this March and came to Shanghai without anything to do. Driven by poverty, he asked his friends to solicit assistance at the pier last night and received thirty to forty dollars in total. He got more than ten dollars. Another, Jiang Asheng, 28 years old, from Yuyao, stated that he was formerly a soldier in the Fifth Company, Second Battalion, Sixty-sixth Regiment, Thirty-third Brigade, Eleventh Division. He was wounded in the head by gunfire and was treated at the Eighteenth Rear Hospital. Now that his wound has healed, he came to Shanghai to look for friends. He met Chen Jingbiao at the pier and discussed the plan. He only received three or four dollars. Another, Wu Xiguo, 24 years old, from Changzhou, was formerly a soldier in the Eleventh Company, Third Battalion, Eighteenth Regiment, Ninth Brigade, Third Division. Another, Liu Rensheng, 29 years old, from Wuxi, was in the same company as Wu Xiguo. The rest of his statement was similar to Chen Jingbiao's. Six dollars in cash, four diaries, a discharge certificate, a ship's pass, fifteen business cards of Li Qingsheng, three symbols, and two Ning Shao ferry tickets were found on Chen and the others. The district chief, believing that the soldiers had violated the law by falsely soliciting donations, sentenced them to be escorted to the General Bureau in the afternoon for verification and handling.</p>

<p>The basic members of the Kangzang Walking Tour held a joint conference on the 12th. Initiator Zhang Yuan was absent due to circumstances. Chairman Wang Jinyuan stated that the group has received numerous requests for information from various agencies and universities both in and outside the city. There have been more than two hundred applicants. Dozens of people have come to the group in person to apply and make contact, but whether or not they will be selected has not been decided. Because the issue of personnel selection is very important, the group must hire experts to interview applicants. As for the regulations, there are not many and they have already been requested, so we are unable to send them immediately. The office has been commissioned to print more and send them separately. We hope that those who are interested in participating in the group and those who have already sent in applications will be sure to come to the group every day from 9 AM to obtain the regulations and have an interview. They must also submit two recent 4-inch half-length photos along with their resumes and supporting documents. Several female comrades with a degree in specialized sports and innovative thinking should be selected, especially those who are good at public relations. Once accepted, all expenses will be provided by the group. The above resolutions were passed and the meeting adjourned at 1 PM.</p>

<p>The Cruelty of Bandits in Fujian Province</p>
<p>Nailing Fingers, Gouging Out Eyes, Splitting Skulls</p>
<p>Untying a Belt to Commit Suicide, Finally Rescued</p>
<p>Liu Yunqing, a famous actor from Mazhen, Hubei, is currently 48 years old. He previously performed at the New Stage in Nanshi and then went to perform at the Great Stage in Fuzhou, the provincial capital, for many years. He was known as "Bailingzi" and his reputation spread throughout southern Fujian. His family was originally from his ancestral home. Last spring, he was suddenly kidnapped by bandits who demanded a huge ransom. Because Liu was unable to raise the money, he was subjected to torture in the bandit den for more than a year. Finally, the bandits nailed Liu's ten fingers to the door, gouged out his eyes, split his skull with a knife, and abandoned him in the wilderness. The cruelty of the scene was horrifying. Fortunately, Liu's life was not meant to end, and he was rescued by friends and sent to a nearby hospital for treatment. He was only discharged from the hospital last month. However, Liu is now blind and his ten fingers are broken and incomplete, leaving him disabled. He returned to the Great Stage to sell his belongings to get fare to return home. Unexpectedly, misfortune struck again. The 160 yuan of life-saving money was stolen by a thief on the ship. The ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and Liu lodged in an inn. He thought that he was useless in the world and decided to commit suicide. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, he untied his belt at the Puai Workshop on Wuma Road to commit suicide. Fortunately, Yang Xinzheng, a member of the Caogjing District Municipal Committee, passed by and immediately rescued him. He was not killed.

<p>Lu Zhenpei, a 44-year-old man from Wenzhou, recently recruited new soldiers in Wenzhou and sent them to Zhejiang Province with Wen Kuaiqing and Lin Changlin. He then boarded a China Merchants Bureau ship to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Lu suddenly had an idea and saw that Jiang Shouyou, Chen Arong, Chen Shixin, Pan Qinggui and other fellow villagers on the ship were honest and gullible. He devised a plan to deceive them, claiming that if each of them gave him two dollars, he could exempt them from buying ship tickets.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The two dollars was much cheaper than the ticket price. Jiang and the others, tempted by the cheap price, readily agreed and each gave Lu two dollars. Lu then gave each of them a new soldier symbol and forced them not to buy tickets. However, Xie Lansheng, the accountant of the inspection department of the China Merchants Bureau, noticed that they were suspicious and interrogated them, revealing the previous situation. Xie believed that this kind of behavior was of great concern to the Bureau's business. When they arrived at the port, he reported it to the Municipal Public Security Water Patrol Team, which sent officers to bring Lu and the others back to the team. According to Jiang Shouyou's statement, he was 35 years old, from Wenzhou, and worked at the Pan Yunjing Clothing Store on Dananmen in Shanghai. Chen Arong stated that he was 20 years old and worked in the same industry as Jiang. Pan Qinggui stated that he was 34 years old and worked at the Pan Taifeng Rosewood Workshop in Xiaonanmen as a partner. Chen Shixin stated that he was 27 years old, from Wenzhou, and worked at the Chen Longxing Rosewood Workshop on Dananmen as a partner. They all stated that they were indeed greedy and careless, which led to them being deceived. Because the matter involved fraud, they were ordered to submit a written statement and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation and investigation.</p>

<p>The long-awaited bicycle race officially opened at 9 PM the night before last at Weile Garden on Haige Road. The joint celebration competition continued last night. No less than six or seven thousand Chinese and foreign men and women came to the venue to watch. The spectacle was extremely lively, and applause erupted with each program. The excitement and interest were indeed the best among various sports competitions. After the appreciation, everyone felt relaxed and refreshed. On the night of the opening, a grand feast was held beside the dance floor in the garden to entertain Chinese and foreign dignitaries and sports leaders, with more than 500 people attending. They wore formal attire and chatted cheerfully. The Macleane military band added to the enjoyment. After the meal, the opening program of the competition consisted of ten events. At that time, the electric lights illuminated the place as bright as day. First, a radio announcement was made, and then seventy cyclists from various countries paraded around the track for one week in the tense atmosphere of roaring applause from the crowds. Then, the competition was held in order. Among them, the most notable programs were four: (1) The Benson Silver Cup Special International Grand Competition was joined by teams from China, Annam, and Japan. The Chinese athletes were Zheng Longfei, Gao Yongnian, Xie Ruquan, and Lu Yongxi. As a result, the Chinese team won the championship with 34 points. The Japanese team came in second with 24 points. The Annam team came in third with 20 points. The first place individual was also the Chinese Zheng Longfei, with a time of 1 minute, 23 seconds, and 2/5 for 1,000 meters. (2) 750-meter handicap race final: the first place went to Chinese Zeng Chuanqing, the second place went to Korean Gao Zhang, with a time of 58 seconds and 2/5. (3) The machine bicycle competition between Mr. Noden and Mr. Yan: the distance was 1,250 meters. As a result, Yan won with a time of 58 seconds. (4) The leader motorcycle demonstration run was 10 kilometers, requiring 40 laps. As a result, Chinese cyclist Zhu Liang won with a time of 6 minutes, 4 seconds, and 2/5. The leader of Zhu was the famous Parisian leader cyclist Dilai. This competition was the most interesting and won a lot of applause. During the intermission of the competition, two dance performances were inserted. The dancers were all European experts, with beautiful clothes and swaying figures, which were fascinating.</p>

<p>Yang Asan Shot Seven Times</p>
<p>All Bullets Removed, No Major Problems</p>
<p>Yang Asan, a ten-year-old resident of West Jiangwan Street, was catching butterflies in the fields at 8 AM yesterday morning when a Westerner nearby shot birds and stray bullets hit Yang Asan. Yang was injured and fell to the ground. The Westerner, realizing that he had caused an accident, immediately went to lift the child up and took him to the police station before transferring him to a nearby hospital for treatment. In the afternoon, he was sent to the St. Luke's Hospital. After the doctor's examination, the child was found to have been shot seven times. Because the bullets were small birdshot, they had little power. All seven bullets have now been removed and there is no major damage.</p>

<p>Ni, a woman from Hangzhou, is currently 27 years old. She has been living in house number thirteen, Sipingli, Zhabei. In 1927, she suffered from severe liver disease and came to Shanghai alone to seek medical treatment. Then, a villain saw that she was young and took advantage of her, tricking her into his scheme. She was lured to the Huangdu area and sold to the Teng family as a concubine. By the time she realized what had happened, it was too late. However, Teng was extremely violent. He would whip her at the slightest dissatisfaction. Ni could not bear the abuse and took the opportunity to escape. She took a car back to Hangzhou, but encountered a bandit on the way and was cheated by him. Fortunately, a staff member of the Railway Bureau discovered the crime and immediately sent Ni and the others to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation. The court sentenced the kidnapper to imprisonment and released Ni. Then, because she ran out of travel expenses, she wandered around the vicinity of the Qiu Xin Bridge in Nanshi at around 2 AM yesterday morning. She was worried about her situation and had no way out. She was frowning and sighing when she was spotted by Chen Jiaxiang, the guard of the 26th station. After asking about the situation, he took her to the first precinct of the first district, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to send her there for settlement.</p>

<p>The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration recently received a letter from the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways stating that Japanese Army Lieutenant General Sakawishi Rihachiro wrote: "I lost a ticket bag containing a total of 410 yuan in Chinese and Japanese banknotes on the night train from Shanghai to Beijing on August 22nd. After entrusting your country's Ministry of the Navy to investigate, the money was returned in full at the Beijing station. I am very impressed with the excellent management of the railway bureau under your ministry. The sleeping car attendant that evening was Chen Yuting. This incident is enough to prove his honesty. I am hereby attaching 50 yuan in silver dollars to be awarded by your ministry to show my gratitude." The department replied that the sleeping car attendant should return the items found by passengers and the bonus of 50 yuan was not to be accepted and the original amount was returned. The department also stated that the attendant Chen Yuting served faithfully and was able to understand the big picture. It is appropriate to send a letter to your bureau to consider awarding him a prize and to inform the attendants on all trains of the reason for this award to serve as an example. After receiving the letter, the railway administration ordered the director of the two-way traffic department to prepare a plan for rewarding the attendant and submit it for approval, and to inform the attendants on all trains. After receiving the document, the director of the transportation department found that the attendant Chen Yuting's honesty in not pocketing the money demonstrated his honesty and integrity, which was commendable. He was given a major merit award as a reward.</p>

<p>Escaping Due to Small Hands and Large Cuffs</p>
<p>Admits to Robbery Without Hesitation</p>
<p>Li Linfa, from Wuxi, had repeatedly committed major cases of armed gang robbery of merchants and civilians' property. On April 15th of this year, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Police Station managed to capture the ringleader. After capturing the leader, they immediately pursued the stolen goods. Li confessed that he had pawned them at the Tongji Pawnshop on Zhejiang Road, etc. The next day, the detectives escorted him to the pawnshop to retrieve the goods. Unexpectedly, he dared to seize the opportunity to struggle, and the handcuffs were instantly destroyed, allowing him to escape like a rabbit. Detective Fang Qing, who had been credited with capturing the thief, was subsequently reprimanded for negligence. Recently, Chinese Constable No. 547 learned that the escaped thief was hiding in the Jisheng Inn on Nanjing Road. The patrol chief specially dispatched Detective Inspector Wei Jinfu, Mao Yiwen, and Detective He Xiaozhi to the capital, where they worked with the Public Security Bureau to secretly arrest Li at the inn. They then transported him back to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Nanjing train. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for investigation. According to Li's confession, his hands were small, and the cuff openings were wide, so he was able to remove the handcuffs himself, thus escaping. He first went to Yantai, then to Nanjing, changing his name to Li Dongsheng and residing at the Jisheng Inn for only six days before being recaptured. Li also admitted without hesitation that he had previously robbed several households on Tianjin Road and other places. Judge Ge ordered him to be detained and interrogated again at a later date.</p>

<p>Declares Provisional Execution</p>
<p>Appeal Already Filed</p>
<p>He Gengxing, a comprador for the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co., issued a promissory note from the Tongsheng Qianzhuang for goods owed to the company, amounting to over 147,000 taels of silver. When the note matured, He had already fled, and Tongsheng had also gone bankrupt. Mitsui Mamoru-nosuke, the manager of the company, and others, sued Yao Weirong, Zhang Xingchu, Hong Cangting, He Gengxing, shareholders of Tongsheng, and Zhang Chunlai, the manager, at the Special District Local Court. The various aspects of the case have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the case was pronounced by Judge Ying of the Special Court the day before yesterday. The defendants were ordered to repay the plaintiff 147,429 taels, 3 mace, and 8 fen of silver in proportion to their shares, along with interest at an annual rate of 5%. The litigation costs were to be borne proportionally by the plaintiff and defendants. After Judge Ying finished the judgment, he immediately declared the permission for provisional execution. However, Chen Tingrui, the lawyer for the defendants Yao Weirong and others, declared in court on behalf of his clients that they were not satisfied and would file an appeal within the statutory period.</p>

<p>Siblings Sues Each Other</p>
<p>Debate Concluded</p>
<p>Sun Xunqiu, a silk merchant from Wuxi, died in the 17th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1928). His estate of over 500,000 yuan had already been divided by his sons, Sun Jingyao and Sun Jiawei, and others. However, Sun Jinghua, Xunqiu's married daughter, was dissatisfied with not receiving a share. She hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against her brothers in the Special District Local Court, demanding a re-division. The various hearings have been reported in this newspaper. The debate continued the day before yesterday. The plaintiff was absent, and the defendant's representative lawyer, Wang Fuchang, submitted a copy of the draft account book to prove that the estate had been divided in the 14th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1925). After Xunqiu's death, a re-division agreement was established, at which time the plaintiff did not make any claims and had also been given 1,000 yuan. Therefore, she had no right to retroactively pursue a re-division. After the defendant's lawyer finished his argument, the plaintiff's lawyer rose to respond, stating that the draft account was not a legally binding document for distribution, and that at the time of establishing the agreement, the law granting inheritance rights to married daughters had not yet been promulgated, so the plaintiff could not make a claim. The 1,000 yuan given was to supplement the plaintiff's dowry, which should be deducted from her share of the inheritance in the future and cannot be considered as a received distribution. Subsequently, Judge Zhou announced the conclusion of the debate and that the judgment would be announced at a later date.</p>

<p>Sun Zhangshi Found Not Guilty and Released</p>
<p>Zhang Jinbao and Dai Jinfa, from Huzhou, rented a stove shed at No. 1530 West Jiaxing Road to secretly manufacture counterfeit national currency. On the night of the 29th of last month, Sun Yunqing, a detective from the Harbin Police Station, went to arrest them and found them working. A woman, Sun Zhangshi, was sitting by the bed watching, and was also arrested. Manufacturing equipment, chemical powders, and the manufactured counterfeit coins were seized and handed over to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. The police station feared that Zhang and others had equipment, so they requested the court to extend the investigation period. However, nothing was found. Judge Ge proposed a continued hearing the day before yesterday. Zhang Jinbao still confessed that the equipment was actually deposited by his Anhui friend, Shen Afa, and Li Tongsheng before they left, and that they also made the counterfeit foreign coins. He only acted as their sales agent, selling them for 25 yuan per hundred. He also admitted that he had been punished twice by officials in the past for mixing counterfeit small foreign coins. Dai Jinfa confessed that he specifically went to Zhang's place to demand debt repayment, and the rest of his words were evasive. Sun Zhangshi confessed that she was employed by someone on Haining Road and that she went to Zhang's place that night because she had kinship with Zhang and had no involvement in the manufacturing of counterfeit coins. Judge Ge reviewed the confessions and, finding Sun Zhangshi not guilty, ordered her release. Zhang Jinbao was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Dai Jinfa was sentenced to one year and three months of imprisonment. The seized counterfeit coins, totaling 159 yuan, and real coins, totaling 5 yuan, along with the equipment, were confiscated according to the list.</p>

<p>Issue of Identity Arises</p>
<p>Investigate the Cause of the Injury</p>
<p>The young woman Gu Yaoshi (age 21) previously hired a lawyer to file a case in the public court against Gu Alian, Gu Dingcai, and the Gu family, accusing them of assaulting and insulting elders, requesting investigation and prosecution. An order was given to await further verification. An summons was issued again the day before yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff had previously married Gu Ande (age 60 this year), the father of the defendants, as his second wife. Unexpectedly, after entering the family, she was resented by the defendants and was beaten and seriously injured last month. There is now a medical certificate to prove the injury, and the defendant's father, who is also the plaintiff's husband, is in court to testify that the defendants did indeed commit the crime of assaulting and insulting elders under Article 293, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting severe punishment. At this point, Gu Ande entered the court to testify. Gu had a beard that was a foot long, and although he was over sixty, he was still energetic. However, due to his old age and deafness, answering questions was inconvenient, so he had prepared a brief summary in advance and presented it to the court, recounting the wrongdoings of his sons. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that, in short, regarding the crime of assaulting and insulting elders, the plaintiff had accused them of, can the plaintiff prove her own identity? Since she cannot provide evidence to confirm that she is indeed Gu Ande's second wife, the accusation cannot stand. Moreover, the injury suffered by the plaintiff was due to her jumping over the wall herself and was not caused by the defendants' beating. He requested a clear investigation. Judge Zhu ordered them to withdraw and await verification and judgment.</p>

He decided to send his wife to his younger brother, Li Liangchen, first, and then come back to collect the luggage. Unexpectedly, he met his fellow townsman, Shi Binglian, on the road, who asked the reason. Shi expressed his distress on his behalf and volunteered to guard the woman while Li went home to fetch the luggage for convenience. Li did not suspect him. To his shock, when Li returned with the luggage, both of them had disappeared. Li was horrified, realizing that he had been deceived.

<p>Of these four steps, the first step is of course the fundamental method, and the first step, the standardization of the company, is something that the company must do for its own benefit. Because without standardization, there can be no mass production; without standardization, there can be no scientific management; without standardization, consumption cannot be eliminated. And mass production, scientific management, and eliminating consumption are all the most beneficial tasks for the company. Therefore, standardization is inseparable from the company. I will now briefly discuss the procedures for standardization within a company. Standardization is closely related to research in the laboratory. For example, the quality of materials, new manufacturing methods, and new inspection methods all come from research. Therefore, to implement standardization, there must be testing. Once there is a testing laboratory, the next step is to draft purchase specifications. All supplies, tools, machines, components, materials, parts, etc., must be specified in detail as the standard for purchase. These specifications are drafted by engineers and must solicit the purchasing department's opinions, because engineers only know the scientific needs, while the purchasing department can consider the market supply situation. In addition to the purchase specifications, there must be inspection specifications. Whether the purchase is made through bidding or other fair methods, after the seller sends the sample, the engineer will begin the inspection according to the inspection specifications to determine whether to accept it. There is often a tolerance limit during this process. If it does not exceed the limit, it can be reluctantly adopted. There are separate inspection specifications for self-manufactured products and must be inspected item by item. As for the standardization of manufacturing methods, it must first be based on the degree of standardization of the equipment before it can be implemented. All letter paper, envelopes, pencils, ink, paper strips, invoices, checks, instructions, etc., must have standards, and standard tools and measuring instruments are fundamental needs in the factory. Because the tools and machines are standardized, and with proper factory layout, continuous manufacturing can be carried out from one level to another, from one method to another. The maximum efficiency of all machines depends on the average speed and orderly methods of manufacturing, so that the interaction between various parts and components has minimal change and minimal resistance, while there is a continuous addition of raw materials, continuous sequential manufacturing, and continuous completion of products. If the equipment is standardized, then the manufacturing methods only need detailed standard instruction manuals to enable workers to understand how to use machines and materials to achieve the desired results, and there must be standard safety rules to prevent workers from any danger. With this, the so-called time study and motion study in scientific management to determine work standards can also have a basis for implementation. The standard of the product is sometimes very difficult to determine and should be based on market research and cost accounting and carefully determined. However, orderers often have purchase specifications to follow. In addition, parts and small items can be standardized. Canned goods, cement, bricks, tiles, nails, doors, and windows are all examples. Some may say that in our country today, the standards of weights and measures set by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce cannot be implemented, so how can we talk about industrial standardization? Little do they know that the standards of weights and measures are one thing, and industrial standardization is another. They can be carried out in parallel without conflict. The standards of weights and measures must be implemented, and there is no reason to wait until the standards of weights and measures are implemented before industrial standardization can be carried out. Moreover, standardization is too important to industry. If our country does not want to revitalize industry, then so be it. But if our country wants to revitalize industry, what other way can it go without standardization? There is another method in rationalization called combination. Combination has two types: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal combination is the combination of an industry with the same industry, such as the combination of the steel industry with the steel industry. Vertical combination is the combination of an industry with related different industries, such as the combination of the steel industry with coal mines and iron mines, or with the machine manufacturing industry. Combination has been practiced in Europe and America for decades and is a feature of modern economic organization. However, the public is quite opposed to it, such as the anti-trust laws in the United States. But in recent years, from experience, it has been gradually realized that combination can make selling prices lower and market conditions more stable, which is indeed beneficial to society. Therefore, the attitude of opposition has changed and tacitly recognizes the need for its existence. For example, the Balfour Committee's 1929 report on industry and commerce in the United Kingdom stated clearly the opinions of the public. The International Economic Conference, organized by labor, capital, and economists, has also included horizontal and vertical combinations in rationalization. It can be seen that combination is a product of industrial development, a worldwide trend that cannot be stopped. I have often traced the reasons for the establishment of combination, and there are three types: (1) The development of machinery. The invention of the steam turbine, the improvement of the engine, the development of the electric motor and the transmission of its high-voltage power, the simplified transportation system and division of labor, and the sufficient standards all enable the work to be expanded and the cost to be reduced. Therefore, the old machines in small factories cannot compete with them and are relegated to the position of elimination. There is no other way except to merge and reorganize to seek survival. (2) The vastness of the market. Large-scale production requires a large-scale market to absorb it. Since the development of railways, highways, sea routes, telegraphs, and telephones, the distance of thousands of miles has been reduced, and transportation and information are extremely convenient. Since the market has become vast, the competition and contact between the same industries have become increasingly apparent. Only through mergers can these be eliminated and the benefits of large-scale production and large-scale distribution be obtained. (3) The emergence of scientific management. With excellent machinery and a vast market, if management is not done properly, mergers will only lead to disputes and will not be beneficial in practice. Therefore, scientific management in the United States has emerged. It does not care about human relationships, but only uses scientific methods to analyze, measure, research, and test to obtain results and implement them. No matter how large or complex the organization is, it is always beneficial. This is also one of the elements that promotes combination. As for the implementation of mergers, valuation methods are often used to jointly estimate the prices of the inventories, machinery, and tools of each party, and then a general management office is organized to direct everything. The staff of this general management office should be selected from the most outstanding talents, and management and machinery should be improved and expanded. Moreover, due to the increase in scale, a testing laboratory can be established for research. These are all advantages of combination that cannot be ignored. In the United States in recent years, the progress of combination has been accelerating, such as public utilities, retail stores and wholesale stores in distribution, banks and financial enterprises, film and game businesses, steel plants, machine plants, manufacturing plants, etc., are too numerous to count. The United Kingdom and Germany also have similar trends. Our country is in the midst of this trend. If we want to develop industry, I am afraid that we cannot be immune. However, there are several things that should be paid attention to when carrying out mergers, which I will record here (1) When various industries are in a state of depression, mergers cannot save them. (2) Mergers cannot salvage the industry in unprofitable years. (3) If the economic organization after the merger is in an unmanageable situation, so that the fixed expenses are greater than the minimum income, then this merger is inappropriate and cannot obtain the benefits of new opportunities, and will undoubtedly fail. (4) The key to merger is good management. I hope that industrialists in our country who adopt mergers will consider these points in advance. In the rationalization carried out in Germany, there is an organization called Cartel, which can be translated as the Industrial Association. The meaning of this is very difficult to determine because the size of its organization and the complexity of its tasks vary with the industry. Now I translate its most approximate definition as [A cartel is an association of producers or distributors that controls market conditions in certain respects.] The control of the market may be solely on production to make the quantity suitable for the elements, so that its price can achieve a satisfactory balance, or it may be strictly regulated solely on the selling price, regardless of the production situation, and production can naturally be limited by the price and the required quantity without the drawback of oversupply, or production and price can be managed simultaneously to make the corresponding supply and demand more secure. Sometimes a whole industry has only one cartel, sometimes the production and price of a whole industry each have a cartel and are all under the management of a general association. Sometimes each part of an industry has a cartel, and there are cooperations and non-cooperations between them. Sometimes many cartels jointly control production and have the right to stipulate how much each factory ships. There is also a central association that stipulates the price for everyone to abide by. The various methods are very different. The purpose of all of them is to eliminate competition, eliminate overproduction, stabilize the market, and obtain high profits. At the same time, in foreign trade, they also increase the strength of business and stand in the best position. Looking at the most developed and most efficient industries in Germany, such as the coal mining industry, the steel industry, and engineering, the organization of cartels in these industries is also the most complete. I will now choose the most complete organization among the cartels as an example to explain it, so that we can know the internal methods. The German Rhine Brown Coal Association (Rheinische BvaunkohlenSynbikat) is in the form of a trading company and has a central sales office. Members, i.e., shareholders, must sign a contract to transfer their produced coal to the sales office. The contract is valid from 1915 to the end of March 1930. The purpose of this cartel is to control the market, control the production and consumption of various mines, and its purpose is to sell coal and allocate the sales components of each mine (Quota). Its nominal capital is 2,122,000 marks, but it does not seek profit itself. Its expenses are paid by collecting ten fenning (one mark is equal to one hundred fenning) for each ton of coal sold to pay it. There is also a compensation fund used to compensate the members' losses, which is also collected in the selling price of coal. If stored, it should not exceed five fenning per ton of briquettes. When voting, the distribution of voting rights is distributed to each member according to the percentage of coal sold, and is modified by the heat value. For example, one ton of briquettes is considered equivalent to two and a half tons of brown coal from the Rhineland (Ｒｈｉｎｅｌａｎｄ) province or two tons of brown coal from the State (Ｓｔａｔｅ) province. There are 26 members in this association (nine belong to government-run companies, eleven belong to mines, and six belong to limited liability companies). The percentage of coal sold is 76.93 for nine members, 12.28 for one member, and 10.9 for six members. Anyone who violates the contract will be heavily fined. The work in the association is divided into four parts (A) Control of production. The role of this association is to make supply and demand correspond to avoid overproduction and price wars. The output of all companies in the association must be handed over to the central agency for distribution according to the prescribed composition. As for technical support in production, each company still handles it independently, but the association provides funding for public research and development. The association has also built 1,230 houses for miners. (B) Control of price sales and market. Selling coal is the exclusive right of this association. All orders from customers are supplied by which company, and the association handles the issuing of invoices, the arranging for shipping to the customer, and the transferring of funds to each company. Moreover, the association decides on the average increase or decrease in the output of each company according to the prescribed components based on market conditions. The components can also be bought and sold, but they must be linked to the designated mine, otherwise they are invalid. Members can request a re-revision of the components every three years. At the end of each year, each member should report the remaining amount that can be supplied outside of the components to the association, so that when demand increases, it can be re-allocated according to the proportional components for supply. The coal used by each company in the association itself is not counted within the components (other associations calculate it separately), that is, the coal used by its affiliated factories, such as chemical plants and steel plants, can also not be counted, but it must be approved by the association, and the so-called affiliated factories must have more than 81% of the shares in the company. The association still has to collect a small amount of fees on all coal that is not counted as components to fill office expenses and prevent fraud. (C) The organization for selling coal has several distribution companies established under the central sales office. Each company has its own sales area, which is delimited according to the location of the railway station. The coal mines near the railway station should be designated to supply the needs of the area. (D) The setting of prices. The association calculates the cost of production in the coal mine, including depreciation, profit, taxes, association expenses, and the income of distributors, and then sets the standard selling price. However, it must be approved by the provincial coal association (Coal Association), and the procedures must be recognized by the provincial government. The price of coal sold by wholesalers should add transportation costs to the standard price at the unloading force. The amount of this increase is regulated by the local coal merchants' association and must allow wholesalers to receive a considerable profit. The above is the method of the Rhine Brown Coal Association. Most other coal industry cartels are similar. Even the cartels of potassium carbonate, cement, and other raw material industries are mostly similar. German law not only allows cartels but also protects them. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has a cartel court to resolve all disputes. All members of the cartel or the public directly affected can file a complaint against the cartel's contract or resolution, but if the reasons are insufficient, they will be dismissed. The ruling of the court is, in fact, the final ruling. Therefore, the cartels in Germany stand on a solid foundation. However, in recent years, horizontal and vertical combinations have greatly expanded, and cartels are inevitably slightly affected. But the trusts in various countries are now organizing international cartels to control the world market, using scientific methods everywhere. Its success can be established and awaited, but the people of our country are still living in a drunken dream, oblivious to everything, is it not very sad? Compatriots, in this tense state of economic invasion, we should wake up and turn back, resolve to strive on our own, unite our strengths, and be of one mind. I dare to offer two strategies for governing the fundamentals and governing the symptoms. The fundamental cure is to vigorously implement industrial rationalization. The symptomatic cure is to vigorously implement tariff protection policies. The two must be carried out simultaneously and cannot be neglected. In addition, training workers, educating specialists, etc., are all things that should be done in rationalization, and finance, transportation, etc., can also adopt rationalization everywhere to seek their improvement and development. Great is the effect of rationalization! Some say that the result of promoting rationalization in Europe and the United States has caused two problems: one is overproduction and the other is unemployment. So far, there is no solution. Little do they know that these two problems are not the result of rationalization. Rationalization is not responsible for them. Overproduction is known because of the implementation of rationalization. It was not known before. In the past, there were countless products stored in the hands of merchants. Since the implementation of rationalization, direct sales to consumers are often adopted to eliminate the profits of intermediaries and make prices lower. As a result, these remaining items are not scattered in the hands of many merchants but accumulated in the hands of a few factories. No wonder they are all alarmed, thinking that there is overproduction. And simplification, standardization, and scientific management often make the inventory of stores reach the smallest number, so the inventory of factories is even more increased. Therefore, overproduction did not start today, but it is only today that the truth can be fully known through the clear revelation of rationalization, so that production and the market can be properly coordinated, and countless amounts of stagnant capital and its associated consumption can be saved. This is exactly the greatest contribution of rationalization, and it is used to blame it instead. What in the world is more unjust than this? (To be continued)</p>
