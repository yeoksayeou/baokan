<h3>各國政府之弱點</h3>
<p>於今世界有名之國其政府無不暴其弱點如日本則有海軍新國防案及緊縮案之難關如英國則有救濟失業案與印度事件之難關如美國則有倫敦海約之特别會難關及新稅則之爲人攻擊如德國則有萊因分立之擾亂如法國則亦以避免政潮之故國會决意提前休會此皆各國政府暴露弱點之現狀也</p>
<p>大抵國家當承平之時諸事易於處置即遇反對者之攻擊亦必用正正堂堂之氣概舉之相抗即或失敗亦無弱點之暴露至若國步艱難所事每左支右絀一受攻擊即用敷衍苟且之法以求暫時過去故其國政府而有弱點之暴露即其國家先有弱點之存在國家而有弱點則其弱點决非一政府所能消弭故一政府倒而别一政府復來其弱點仍爲人攻擊明知不能以人我之故而有所損益則攻擊與辯護皆爲表面但用敷衍苟且之法以苟延其政權雖露弱點而亦非所惜也</p>

<h3>新披露之</h3>
<h3>石藍協約（二）</h3>
<p>予第一次與藍辛氏談話之要點如下</p>
<p>予曰「吾人今旣共同加入協約國方面參與大戰愼勿令敵人獲有少許離間各協約國之機會敵人大約將利用移民問題與中國問題以離間日美兩國移民問題今彼技已窮當防其專力於中國問題以達其離間日美之目的」</p>
<p>藍氏曰「尊論與予實相吻合但予屢聞貴國欲趁世界各國忙於戰事之際在遠東作自私之企圖近者外間復謠傳日本在華採行覇權政策使中國領土完整之保存與開放門户之政策成爲空談若日美兩國政府今能發一共同宣言重申開放門户政策在華機會均等及保全中國領土之完整則匪特足止敵人之反宣傳並足使日美國民了解時局之眞相」</p>
<p>予曰「照目下情形觀之共同宣言猶不足收效至於保存中國領土之完整及開放門户與機會均等主義已於一九○八年日美所訂之羅特高原條約中特别聲明日本復於日英條約及日俄條约中一再聲明此種政策今若重加聲明日本人民殊不介意更可慮者反將引起日本人民之誤解美政府疑及日本對華之志願欲壓迫日政府作此聲明日政府殊不願採此行動以引起誤會職是之故予以爲此種宣言非時勢所宜宣言中應加入新生之事從日本方面觀察日本在華有特殊關係非其他各國所能及在租借地中尤甚正如美國在西半球具有特殊關係其對墨西哥曁中美洲各國尤甚此種情形大槪因各國地理上之關係而起又如門羅主義無須世界其他各國承認日本之在中國具有特殊地位亦猶是也有時得其他列强承認此種地位不無裨益但日本前已於日英日俄及日法協約中聲明日本在華之特殊地位矣是以兩國除宣布保存中國領土之完整曁開放門户機會均等主義外且應另發一關於中日兩國具有特殊關係之宣言如此辦理則虚僞宣傳如尊意（指藍氏）所指者當可止其流行并可免去日本人民之誤解同時又可澄清遠東不良之空氣」</p>
<p>藍氏曰「吾儕之談話已具嚴重色彩鄙意以爲宜再從容從長計議」</p>
<p>予與國務卿藍辛氏第一次談話原屬泛論一切然結果竟直達本題予之直率勇敢之態度似已使藍氏爲之驚訝也</p>
<p>予覺藍氏對於本問題態度殊爲冷淡但</p>
<p>予於前數日内曾與美總統威爾遜談話</p>
<p>予之希望已寄於威氏之態度矣</p>
<p>嗣因日本政府之回訓遲遲未到予乃赴紐約踐市長曁紐約歡迎會之約至第二次與國務卿談話須俟予歸來爲之</p>
<p>予至紐約承各方歡宴予則乘機多方解釋日本對華所取之政策并聲明日本極願採取門户開放政策以促進日本對華貿易又聲明日本對此政策之希望予并用最直率之言語討論在遠東有一主義與西半球之門羅主義性質正復相同紐約人士對於予所言者均加以友好注意予在紐約所演講者當然均已達於美總統及國務卿之耳予信自予到美以來於袪除美總統對於日本對華政策所抱之疑慮多所盡力」</p>

<h3>倫敦將有</h3>
<h3>英國新式足球</h3>
<p>倫敦厚華德企業組合素以辦理振興運動著名現擬介紹六人制之新式足球準備於月内在藜頓先試古臘頓之比賽亦已有成議並與白市及溫布利大運動場各關係者接洽積極進行普及斯技</p>
<p>此新式足球每隊以六人組織守門一後衛二前鋒三比賽時全員及裁判線審均帶假面且擬提供獎金俾得引誘一流選手參加現欲使用球塲四個舉行錦標會以一千英磅爲决賽之懸賞金藉以吸收觀客之興味</p>
<p>各隊擬以搏克紙牌爲代表名稱假使溫布利之接洽成議則溫布里名爲“Ａｃｅ”白市爲“Ｋｉｎｇ”古臘頓爲“Ｑｕｅｅｎ”而藜頓則爲“Ｊａｃｋｓ”每隊輪流相交比賽球場長八十碼闊六十碼比賽時間普通爲九十分鐘則劃分爲十五分鐘但射門只限由罰球界限内攻入如遇兩隊不分勝負則以踼角球數之多賽而定之</p>
<p>據唱導此新式足球之厚華德氏談話現已有多數明星願意參加初次試行各員雖戴假面日後當露現其本來眞相云</p>
<p>惟足球恊會定規球員於季節完結後不得參加六人制之表演賽若有違犯者則受放逐除名之懲罰至於唱辦此新式游戲關係者聲明自信可徵求一流球員絕延藉屬任何球隊且現已有多數明星報名効勞隨時可以舉行比賽堅信此六人制之新式足球將來定必發展成功云</p>

<h3>大蝦蟆考（繡君）</h3>
<p>蝦蟆視蟾蜍較小亦蛙屬也吾讀清癯君重可五斤之大蝦蟆一作爲洒然異之酉陽雜爼所述之金背蝦蟆恐亦無此龐大焉繼而考之是物固有大如盤大如鼎大如牀者重可五斤尙未足爲大也述如下</p>
<p>舊唐書五行志云神龍中渭河有蝦蟆大如一石鼎里人聚觀數日而失是歲大水漂溺京城數百家唐書五行志云先天二年六月京師朝堂磚下有大蛇出長丈餘有大蝦蟆如盤而目赤如火相與鬥俄而蛇入於大樹蝦蟆入於草又舊唐書五行志云李揆作相前一月有大蝦蟆如牀見室之中俄失所在占者以爲蟇天使也有福慶之事</p>
<p>綜上所述論之自入草外一則俄失所在一則數日而失詎蝦蟆亦能變化不測耶信也何以解於婁東某鄕人獲一重可五斤之大蝦蟆乎</p>
<p>吾人參稽所及尙有一至奇之事爲亘古所未有者則以蝦蟆在柱中作聲也附述之唐懷州凝眞觀東廊柱已五十餘年道士往往聞柱中有蝦蟆聲不知的處後因柱朽壞易之廚人斫以爲薪柱中得一蝦蟆其柱先無孔也見五行記夫廊柱無孔蝦蟆何由而入即云柱已五十餘年然道士聞蝦蟆聲時柱完好如故也向非因柱朽壞而易或無廚人斫以爲薪則奚從而知柱中有一蝦蟆乎此事較重可五斤之大蝦蟆尤爲奇特可見宇宙之大何奇蔑有此亦理之不可究詰者矣</p>

<h3>歐洲作家新著鳥瞰兩兄弟（曼如）</h3>
<p>法國柏萊伏斯特作小說</p>
<p>莫洛懷（Ｍaurois）新近說過這様的話「預言是一件危險的事情然而我還是來預言一下我要告訴你三個年紀不到三十歲的作家底名字這三個人假使我的猜測不錯將來會在法國文學上佔據很重要的地位這三個人是盎得萊向松（Ａndre　Ｃhanson）盎得萊馬爾祿（Ａndre　Ｍalraux）和若安柏萊伏斯特（ＪeanＰrevost）」現在我們要談的就是最後的一個柏萊伏斯特因爲他新近出版了一部小說（Ｌes　Ｐreres　Ｂouquinquant）</p>
<p>柏萊伏斯特是一個矮胖子黄頭髮藍眼睛腦門迭人臉兒像一個海盜是一個很熱心的運動家又是一個拳術好手他在高等師範學校讀書而這所學校對於一個著作家却是有益又危險的有益的是它能夠使它的學生得到很透澈的敎育危險的是它會使它的學生終身脫不了引經據典咬文嚼字的迂腐脾氣</p>
<p>幸而柏萊伏斯特他自己有一種可驚的精力和高超的趣味他克服了一切能損壞他天才的成分因此成爲法國文壇底新興人材他到現在已經寫了兩部書都是非同凡品的著作第一部是Ｄix　hiotieme　Ａnnee極綦忠實誠懇地描畫出正當歐洲大戰以後的一個抱着進步觀念的法國青年學生底生活這是一篇自供又是一部自傳第二部剛才出版的就是Ｌes　Ｆreres　Ｂoubuinquant是一部寫民衆生活的長篇小說優點甚多</p>
<p>情節是很平常的情節差不多在警察署底擋案中就可以找到的記得（Ａndre　Ｇide）就很愛用這様的情節故事是說到一個少年的機匠在一隻賽因河上的大駁船裏做了他嫂嫂的情人後來他因爲他哥哥打他的嫂嫂他就殺了他哥哥事情發覺了的時候那女人承認這殺人罪是她犯的這様她總算救了她的情人而她的情人也只好接受了她的犧牲情節大略如此但故事底本身並不重要重要的是作者描寫勞動者的新頴手法和特殊作風大多的作家們寫勞動者底生活都是站在外面觀察本人並不了解所以往往未能眞確譬如左拉（Ｚola）底人物雖然有史詩般的壯美可是並不切合現實柏萊伏斯特却不同了他的書是充滿着眞實他寫出了他們的性格底繁雜他使我們明的民衆底道德標準往往是和資產階級底不同不過他們的情慾却是一様的這一本小說眞可以說是寫盡了法國民衆底心理</p>
<p>柏萊伏斯特對於他這部小說是很抱負不凡的他的心願是要把他這部小說寫得像囂俄的「哀史」（Ｌes　Ｍiserablcs）這自然是誇張了一點但是這青年作家底志向却由此可以看出了</p>
<h3>羅蒂雪亞（曼如）</h3>
<p>法國約洛作小說</p>
<p>在現今的巴黎文學界很少有人能像愛特蒙約洛（Ｅdmond　Ｊaloux）那様地出名的第一他是Ｌes　Ｎouvelles　Ｌitteraires底批評家聲譽極好他介紹過許多外國文學作品給法國的讀者這些作品生出了很好的影響第二他向來肯帮助青年作家所以他的人緣很好第三他是第一個介紹新德意志文學的法國人和霍夫曼司特爾等都很有交情</p>
<p>但是約洛並不祇是一個批評家他也是一個小說家尤其是他是一個眞有才學的人物他那充滿學識智慧敏感談話是非常有誘惑力的初次和他會面的人看了他那沉靜的容顏緩慢文雅的聲音總覺得他是一個恬靜克實的人物但是過了不久就會發現他是一個充滿着神秘情緒和愛詩趣的人物約洛底書和他的談話一様在他的書裏和他的談話裏最可愛的就是那種眼前若有一個更美的世界般的感覺而這更美的世界者是全由他所讀過的書底記憶所組成是文學家底幻想世界底綜合</p>
<p>他的所著「羅蒂雪亞」（Ｌoetitia）就是用了這様的詩情寫的它講到女郎羅蒂雪亞底故事羅蒂雪亞愛上了一位偉大的德國詩人瓦脫格勞爾（Ｗalter　Ｇraul）然而她並不認識他從没有和他見過一面格勞爾底爲人很像兩位大詩人他所作詩底品格像里克（Ｒilpe）他的需要有一位女性做伴像雪萊（Ｓhelley）每一個女人在他没有和她同居以前他都看作天仙菩薩但是一到他和她同居而且發現她亦不過是一個凡人而已的時候他就非常不滿意立即毀滅了他自己的偶像羅蒂雪亞亦就和别的女人一様這様地被毀滅了</p>
<p>這様短短的幾句話是不能說出這本小說底魔力的約洛寫這部小說彷彿愛倫城底寫「厄處家之敗亡」（Ｆall　of　theHouse　of　Usker）把這件美麗的戀愛底敗亡歷史籠罩在神秘隱約的氛圍氣使讀者不能自主地起了抑鬰悽切的感覺</p>

<h3>青年應該努力的戲劇運動（季平）</h3>
<p>戲劇運動近來似乎已經引起社會的注意了一般從事這個運動的人都是很熱烈地在想望牠的成功這自然多少可以給他們安慰的不過在實際上牠的内容究竟是些什麽呢牠給我們的印象又是怎様呢這却不能不使我們感到一個巨大的危機</p>
<p>在上海現存的劇團連各學校的小規模組織大槪有數十個在這幾個月内我們看到了藝術劇社的前後兩次公演辛酉劇社的「狗的跳舞」戲劇協社的「威尼斯商人」以及最近南國社的「卡門」和復旦社的「西哈諾」在這幾次公演的過程中我們可以看出一般對於劇塲和實演兩方面似已有了相當的注意然而「最重要的劇本」却都使人很感失望地搖頭這些劇本除了藝社劇社的「西線無戰事」「阿珍」等含着充分的宣傳意味做政治的工具外其餘大都可說是偏於浪漫的男女愛戀一類事情而主要在享樂的意義上這些實是受了現社會的制約即是現社會的一般所好是如此爲迎合心理不能不如此但是這様的結果我們覺得除了對於青年的性的暗示之外别無什麽這種别無什麽的結果是我們戲劇運動的主旨麽</p>
<p>戲劇是一種綜合的藝術牠是以音色彩及動的立體即是以時間及空間來直接表現人之生活的藝術以一切感覺的綜合爲基礎而使人感受的牠的藝術的表現様式是最複雜而最接近於人的生活様式因之牠是爲多數人所要求而有着深廣的侵入於多數人底特殊力在古代社會裏戲的發生是很早的事牠是民族的產物民族文化的表現在宗敎的國家尤都成爲敬神的典禮但是到了專制的封建社會裏却大都成了帝王用來麻醉多數人的工具而戲劇的内容也就只是「上京求名」「鋤奸除惡」這一類把戲到現在這種舊劇還保存在鄕村和都市被感染的過去的感情和情緒依然很豐富在戲劇界這様的一個情形之下我們起來把這一種流毒克服而建設新的戲劇成爲必要這必要便產生了戲劇運動戲劇運動旣是成爲一種運動自然不只是自然的發生而是目的性的意識的努力但是這個努力到現在已有了相當的時期牠的結果是些什麽呢這不能不使我們失望因爲舊的流毒非但未能克服而所謂新的建設也只是同様含有毒質的東西像上面說過目前這一運動的中心内容除了作爲某種宣傳外都是一些浪漫的東西這種東西的結果只有削弱青年英勇的志氣造成萎靡頽廢的態度而這個傾向現在方興未艾地進行着這還不是一個巨大的危機麽</p>
<p>這個危機非但是戲劇運動本身的抑且是關係着民族的前途因此我們必須要來克服而這個克服又是怎様呢</p>
<p>第一確立中心意識我們覺得過去的進來呢·還是出去（讀餘攝）</p>
<p>戲劇運動對於舊劇的揚棄固然似已盡了相當的力量但是對於新的建設却只知一味求新没有一個中心意識來决擇結果只是販賣一些外國作品來迎合低級趣味的心理而支離破碎毫不能給人向上的暗示更說不了什麽民族文化所以要求這一個運動在實際上眞眞能荷負起偉大的使命只有樹立中心意識作爲其礎才能系統地進行在羣衆中發生眞實的力量而成爲民族文化的最高表現</p>
<p>其次民族主義的建設中心意識的確立成爲目前戲劇運動急切的需要這在理論上是再無疑義的事了但是什麽才是眞眞可以作爲中心意識的呢這自然只有在着社會客觀事實中决定了我們知道戲劇原是民族的產物自然牠的最高價値只有從發揚民族精神擁護民族利益這一點上來估定換句話說牠的最大的任務是在促成民族的進化現在中國民族是怎様呢無疑地牠是困頓在不能獨立的次殖民地的地位而過去封建意識的遺留以及目前這様的萎靡不振都是足以破壞民族的力量而趨於更困苦的境遇因此在我們今日的戲劇運動的中心意識必然地只有民族主義的建設從這個出發我們來排除一切忸忸怩怩淫亂頽廢有害於民族的東西而喚起民族的意識激勵民族的朝氣美化民族的生活集中民族的力量一致地爲民族而爭鬭這様才能展開戲劇本身的意義這様才能完成這一運動所具的使命</p>
<p>復次組織有力的劇團上面一般地戲劇運動的危機和克服的方法理論地指示出來了但是主要還在實踐的意義什麽才是實踐的意義呢那自然只有組織有力的劇團來刻苦地爲這主張而奮鬥我們知道在上海現存的劇團固然很多球戰（讀餘攝）</p>
<p>但都祇有消極的力量且爲這一運動的病根所在因此這個有力的劇團的組織實爲必要而且必須是要克服其他劇團不健全的理論和行動而站在領導的地位做一個新的運動的中心</p>
<p>總之過去的戲劇運動隨着歷史的進展已漸漸失去其所有的意義而陷入了一個巨大的危機現在正是突破這危機展開新的局面的時候而這一個新的局面根據着客觀社會的需要陪隨着最近文藝運動的傾向必然地是民族主義的而負起這一個責任的也必然地是有爲的青年因爲戲劇的人才是多方面的牠需要活潑和熱情眞摯和進化······種種感動的力量而這力量只有青年是具備的同時在目前中國民族的解放都寄托在青年身上而解放運動的工作尤先在喚起民族的覺醒戲劇是最能感染人的因此戲劇運動在解放運動的整個過程中實是重要而且有力的一部青年只有與個運動目的性的結合起來從目前這種危機中解放出來堅確地站在民族主義的立塲上來打開一條血路實踐戲劇運動所具的意義完成青年應有的使命</p>

<h3>Praising the Forward Troops</h3>
<p>Nanjing National Government telegraphed forward troops, stating that on the 9th of this month, the 4th anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath Ceremony was held, and the masses were excited and the revolutionary atmosphere was unusually tense. Recalling the expedition fifteen years ago, planning the overall situation from a corner of Guangdong, with hundreds of times the difficulties and obstacles, now in a short time, the southeast has been established and the northwest has been taken. This is indeed due to the invincibility of the doctrine, and also due to the spirit of the entire army obtaining talented people, striving and sacrificing, which is enough to inspire the masses. It is also due to the loyalty, bravery and unwavering advance of our officers and soldiers. Although there are many obstacles in the revolutionary process, it is expected that the cleaning and sweeping can be done in a short period of time. However, the hardship of the troops in the hot summer cannot be expressed enough. We hope that all officers and soldiers will be concerned about the hard work of offense and defense, and we also hope to convey our condolences on our behalf. Recalling the glory of the past and predicting the final victory, the foundation of the country will be permanently consolidated. (Eleventh Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Eleventh day, the National Government issued telegrams commending the 48th Route Army. (1) To Commander-in-chief He Jian of Changsha: This time, Zhang Gui's army launched a full-scale attack on Hunan. The commander-in-chief prudently responded to the enemy, and all officers and soldiers were loyal and unyielding, finally stopping the fierce attack and laying the foundation for Hunan. This is deeply commendable. All meritorious officers under his command should be commended by order to encourage their merits, and it is still hoped that he will urge his troops to eliminate the remaining rebels as soon as possible. (2) To Director He of Changsha, forwarding to Division Commander Tan Daoyuan: Zhang Gui planned to attack Hunan and move eastward. The division commander rushed to aid day and night, eliminating the rebellious plot with our prestige and consolidating the upper reaches. This is very commendable. All meritorious officers and soldiers should be commended by order to comfort their hard work. (3) To Director He of Changsha, forwarding to Division Commander Li Yunheng: Zhang Gui's remaining rebels disturbed Hengyang and Xiangxiang. The division commander rushed to aid day and night, working very hard. The prestige established by his voice made the rebellious enemy flee and Xiangxiang restored peace. This is very commendable. All meritorious officers and soldiers should be commended by order to encourage them. It is still hoped that he will urge his troops to quickly destroy the rebellious bandits and achieve complete success. (4) To Commander-in-chief Chen Jitang of Guangzhou, Commander-in-chief Jiang Guangnai, Division Commander Cai Tingkai, Division Commander Li Yangjing: Zhang Gui's rebellious army窜湘余焰独张. Relying on the commander-in-chief and the commander to supervise the army to aid and divide the fierce rebels, the division commander and others relied on their loyalty and bravery to eliminate the stubborn enemy. The spirit of the officers and soldiers under their command, who did not avoid hardships and sacrificed for the country, is indeed the glory of the revolutionary war history, which is deeply commendable. All should be commended by order to encourage meritorious service, and it is still hoped that the rebellious bandits will be cleared as soon as possible to prevent them from fleeing to other places and ensure the peace of the country. This is what we hope for. (Eleventh Day Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Weaknesses of Governments of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Today, all famous countries in the world have exposed their weaknesses in their governments. For example, Japan has the difficult hurdle of the Navy's New National Defense Plan and the Austerity Plan. The United Kingdom has the difficult hurdle of the Relief for the Unemployed and the Indian Incident. The United States has the difficult hurdle of the London Naval Treaty Special Meeting and the New Tariff being attacked. Germany has the disturbance of the Rhine separation. France also decided to adjourn the parliament early to avoid political turmoil. These are all current situations of governments exposing weaknesses in various countries.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when a country is in peacetime, everything is easy to handle. Even if it encounters attacks from opponents, it will definitely use a fair and aboveboard attitude to resist. Even if it fails, there is no exposure of weaknesses. As for when a country is in difficult times, everything is often stretched and overwhelmed. When attacked, it will use perfunctory methods to seek temporary passage. Therefore, if the government of a country exposes weaknesses, it means that the country first has the existence of weaknesses. If a country has weaknesses, then its weaknesses will definitely not be eliminated by one government. Therefore, one government falls and another government comes, and its weaknesses are still attacked. Knowing that it cannot be improved by personal reasons, the attacks and defenses are all superficial, but perfunctory methods are used to extend its regime. Even if it exposes weaknesses, it is not something to be sorry about.</p>

As Gandhi's unconstitutional movement is still in progress, the government will naturally not invite Gandhi to participate in the Round Table Conference to be held in London.</p>

He also said, "You can set fire to schools or smash them to powder, but don't talk to me about business." This is because the businessmen in Bombay said that the anti-British movement will destroy Bombay's business, so Mr. Badaner expressed this view. (World)</p>
<p>The British Conservative Party Holds</p>
<h3>The Resolution to Overthrow the Government</h3>
<p>George's Fickle Actions</p>
<p>Only Provoke the Labor Party's Disgust</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: The Liberal Party leader George advocated voting for the financial bill in the House of Commons last night, almost causing the government to fail. Today's Daily Express mocked his fickleness. George's actions have aroused the anger of the government party and caused disputes within the Liberal Party itself. Moreover, his talks with the government on the unemployment issue will be obstructed. George initially said that he had no intention of overthrowing the government and only wanted to help the unemployed. Therefore, Liberal Party members believed that George would not propose a vote. After he proposed a vote, Liberal Party members took different stances. Four voted in favor of the government and twenty-five voted against. However, many people did not vote. It is found that among those who did not vote were Samuel and McLellan, all important figures in the Liberal Party. The Conservative Party voted as a whole, showing their determination to overthrow the government. Furthermore, the Conservative Party hid fifty of its members in the club. The Liberal Party saw that the government party in the chamber was more than the opposition party and thought that the government would not fail anyway. They did not know that when the vote was announced, the fifty Conservative Party members all crowded out of the tunnel and entered the chamber. The government would undoubtedly fail if it did not get four papers of approval votes from the Liberal Party.</p>

<h3>Russian Government Plans</h3>
<h3>To Fill the Tatar Strait</h3>
<p>So That Northern Sakhalin Island Is Connected to the Asian Continent</p>
<p>Vladivostok Becomes a Year-Round Open Port</p>
<p>Moscow News: The Tatar Strait separates Russia's Northern Sakhalin Island from the coastal state. The shortest distance between them is only two miles and the water is shallow. As early as twenty years ago, many scientists proposed filling the strait to connect Ping Sakhalin Island to the mainland, but it was only a scientific suggestion and the Russian government authorities never intended to implement this plan. It has recently been rumored in political circles that the Soviet government intends to implement this plan in order to make Vladivostok a year-round open port and is studying its feasibility. It is said that because the strait is shallow, it is possible to realize it.</p>
<p>Also, Tokyo News: According to a member of the Russian Embassy, the embassy has not received official news regarding the filling of the Tatar Strait, so it cannot confirm its accuracy. Even if this plan is realized, the benefits can only be known by a scientist, and it is quite difficult for ordinary people to understand. However, it can be asserted that the current in that area will change greatly after the strait is filled, and the fishery around Sakhalin Island will also be affected.</p>

<p>Washington, 10th (Associated Press) - A political secret has been revealed today: President Hoover's refusal to release part of the documents relating to the Kellogg-Briand Pact is due to the fact that they contain documents from the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Dawes, criticizing certain important European figures, which are not suitable for publication. Dawes is known for his outspokenness, and part of the documents contains his reports directly pointing out the flaws of political figures in London and Europe. Therefore, Hoover is unwilling to disclose them as materials for the press to cause diplomatic disputes.</p>
<h3>Italian Anti-Fascist Party Sneaks into Switzerland</h3>
<p>Guards Fired Shots to Stop Them but Failed</p>
<p>May Cause International Negotiations</p>
<p>Bern, 10th (National News Agency) - A group of Italian anti-Fascists attempted to sneak into Switzerland at night. Italian border guards fired shots to stop them. The anti-Fascists returned fire. Eventually, they were pushed to the border. Although a few were arrested, most of them escaped across the border. Two Italian soldiers were killed and several were injured. It is expected that this incident may lead to negotiations between the two countries. Italian anti-Fascists often try to flee the country. Although the Italian military police are heavily guarded, every few days some manage to escape into Switzerland. On the other hand, if a group of tourists accidentally wanders into Italian territory in a remote area, it often causes a great deal of trouble.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Decides to Adjourn Early</h3>

<p>Paris, 10th (National News Agency) - The French cabinet has decided that the parliament will adjourn before the Democratic Memorial Day on Monday.

Prime Minister Tardieu recently said that he would resolve them all before the recess. Now the government has suddenly made this decision in order to avoid political turmoil. Prime Minister Tardieu's position has weakened significantly due to repeated failures in parliament, and the left wing has shown more active opposition. Therefore, they want to close the parliament early.</p>

<h3>Japanese-Russian Fishing Conflict Incident</h3>
<p>Under Serious Protest</p>
<p>Bypassed Replying to Upper House Members</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Den-tsu) - Two members of the Kosei-kai of the Upper House, Kuroda Nagakazu and others, visited Foreign Minister Shidehara last night and questioned him, saying that Japanese fishing boats have been fired upon by Soviet monitoring ships recently, which is clearly hostile to Japanese fishing boats. What are the government's countermeasures? The Soviet Union plans to lay a railway in the oil fields of Sakhalin. Will the Japanese government tacitly approve of this? The Soviet Union is using huge sums of money to promote communism in Japan. Doesn't this violate the treaty? The Foreign Minister replied that the incident of Soviet monitoring ships firing on Japanese ships is currently under serious protest and that such illegal acts will not occur again in the future. The truth about the Sakhalin oil field railway is currently under investigation. There is no such thing as Soviet embassy officials promoting communism.</p>

<h3>Tragedy of the German Coal Mine Explosion</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (National News Agency) - In the coal mine explosion accident near Hashtaf, Upper Silesia, more than 150 people died. It is the biggest tragedy in the history of German mining. The president and major government officials have donated large sums of money to provide relief to the bereaved families. The first mine shaft has been cleared of earth and rocks, and eighty bodies have been found one after another. Fifty-six people have been rescued alive. About eighty people are buried inside the second mine shaft. Because the passage is blocked and carbon dioxide is still spewing out, it is impossible to carry out construction. Moreover, it is expected that these people are unlikely to survive, so the search work has been temporarily suspended. However, the families of the workers are still crying around the mine office all day long, which is extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>Newly Disclosed</h3>
<h3>Stone-Lansing Agreement (II)</h3>
<p>The main points of my first conversation with Mr. Lansing are as follows:</p>
<p>I said, "Now that we have jointly joined the Allied side in the Great War, we must not allow the enemy to gain any opportunity to alienate the Allied countries. The enemy will probably use the immigration issue and the China issue to alienate Japan and the United States. The immigration issue is now exhausted. We must prevent them from focusing on the China issue to achieve their purpose of alienating Japan and the United States."</p>
<p>Mr. Lansing said, "Your opinion is in line with mine, but I have repeatedly heard that your country wants to take advantage of the fact that countries around the world are busy with the war to make selfish attempts in the Far East. Recently, there have been rumors that Japan is adopting a hegemonic policy in China, making the preservation of China's territorial integrity and the open door policy empty talk. If the governments of Japan and the United States can now issue a joint declaration reaffirming the open door policy, equal opportunities in China, and the preservation of China's territorial integrity, it will not only be enough to stop the enemy's counter-propaganda, but also allow the people of Japan and the United States to understand the truth of the situation."</p>
<p>I said, "Judging from the current situation, a joint declaration is not enough to be effective. As for preserving China's territorial integrity and the principle of open door and equal opportunity, it has been specially stated in the Root-Takahira Agreement signed by Japan and the United States in 1908. Japan has repeatedly stated this policy in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the Russo-Japanese Treaty. Now, if we reaffirm it, the Japanese people will not mind it. What is more worrying is that it will cause misunderstandings among the Japanese people. The US government suspects Japan's ambitions towards China and wants to force the Japanese government to make this declaration. The Japanese government is unwilling to take this action to cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I believe that this kind of declaration is not suitable for the times. The declaration should include new things. From the Japanese perspective, Japan has a special relationship with China that other countries cannot match, especially in leased territories, just as the United States has a special relationship in the Western Hemisphere, especially with Mexico and the countries of Central America. This situation is probably due to the geographical relationship of each country. Moreover, the Monroe Doctrine does not require the recognition of other countries in the world. Japan's special position in China is also the same. Sometimes, the recognition of this position by other powers is not without benefit, but Japan has already stated its special position in China in the Anglo-Japanese, Russo-Japanese, and Franco-Japanese Treaties. Therefore, in addition to announcing the preservation of China's territorial integrity and the principle of open door and equal opportunity, we should also issue another declaration on the special relationship between China and Japan. If we do this, false propaganda, as you (referring to Mr. Lansing) pointed out, can be stopped from spreading, and the misunderstandings of the Japanese people can be avoided. At the same time, it can also clear up the bad atmosphere in the Far East."</p>
<p>Mr. Lansing said, "Our conversation has taken on a serious color. I think it is appropriate to discuss it further."</p>
<p>My first conversation with Secretary of State Lansing was generally about everything, but as a result, it directly reached the topic. My frank and courageous attitude seemed to have surprised Mr. Lansing.</p>
<p>I felt that Mr. Lansing's attitude towards this issue was very cold, but</p>
<p>I had spoken with US President Wilson in the past few days</p>
<p>My hopes were pinned on Mr. Wilson's attitude.</p>
<p>Later, because the Japanese government's response was delayed, I went to New York to fulfill the mayor's and the New York Welcome Committee's appointment. The second conversation with the Secretary of State would have to wait for my return.</p>
<p>I went to New York and received banquets from all parties. I took the opportunity to explain the policies that Japan has adopted towards China and stated that Japan is extremely willing to adopt an open door policy to promote Japan's trade with China. I also stated Japan's hope for this policy. I also discussed in the most frank language that there is a doctrine in the Far East that is exactly the same in nature as the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere. The people of New York paid friendly attention to what I said. Of course, what I said in New York had reached the ears of the US President and Secretary of State. I believe that since my arrival in the United States, I have done my best to dispel the doubts that the US President has about Japan's policies towards China."</p>

<h3>He Jian Returns to Changsha from Hengzhou</h3>
<p>Farewell Dinner for He Yingqin on the Evening of the 6th</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The military affairs of Hunan Province have come to an end. Yesterday, on the 5th, Liu Wendao came to Hunan by plane on the North Persian, representing General Commander Chiang to express his condolences to He Yingqin and He Jian and to discuss all the aftermath. Liu brought a letter from Chiang to He Jian, which said, "Brother Yunqiao, I salute you. In this campaign against the rebels, your department sacrificed everything to be loyal to the Party and the country, and your achievements are great. It adds glory to the history of the revolution. Zhongzheng is also honored. Brother Chensu came here and learned about the situation at that time. I am especially grateful. I hope that you will lead your troops to destroy this chief before you eat, so as to secure the Party and the country. I have specially asked Brother Chen to come to discuss everything in person and to express my condolences. Sincerely, Chiang Kai-shek, July 4th, 5:00." At that time, He Jian was still directing the various departments in Hengzhou. Upon hearing that Liu Wendao had come to Hunan as a representative of General Commander Chiang and that He Yingqin had to return to Wuhan, he took two cars from Hengzhou back to the province at 6:10 pm on the 6th. He arrived at the Xiaowumen train station in Changsha at 5:40 pm, where more than 100 people from the Party, government, and military circles welcomed him at the station. He immediately boarded a chartered car and went straight to the large living room of the provincial government, where he had light refreshments with the welcoming people and reported on the situation at the front. Those who returned to the province with He included only Secretary-General Liu Pengnian and Wen Susong, a senior staff officer of the Wuhan Headquarters. That evening, He prepared a Western dinner in the large flower hall of the provincial government to entertain He Yingqin and all the staff of the headquarters to show his farewell. Figures from the Party, government, and military circles accompanied the dinner, and the only foreign guests were Liu Wendao, Zhang Buxian, the representative of Guizhou Province, Huang Xingyi, the representative of Jiangxi Province, and several pilots. During the dinner, He Jian reported on the course of the battle. Then, He Yingqin gave a speech, generally stating that the greatest reason for achieving a great victory in the shortest possible time was that all the generals and soldiers were able to follow the plan set by the headquarters and work together to implement it, and secondly, that all the troops had a spirit of hard work and sacrifice, and thirdly, that the weather was very good and our aircraft were able to achieve great results and inflict heavy losses on the enemy. Finally, he reported on the situation of the battles on the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan lines, and that Yan and Feng would be annihilated sooner or later. However, the current focus should be on the disturbances caused by the communists in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, which is not a simple military problem. He hoped that the Party, government, and military would unite and share the responsibility of finding ways to eliminate them so that the people could look forward to peace and alleviate the hidden worries of the Party and the country. Liu Wendao then gave a speech reporting on the situation he had observed on the Longhai and Pinghan fronts recently. Then, they toasted each other until 10:30 pm before they dispersed.</p>
<h3>Competition Between Hantieh and Northeast Railway</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) system has always used the gold standard. All passenger and freight fares are officially collected in gold certificates. In the midst of rising gold prices and falling silver prices, they still maintain their old position without any changes, intending to take advantage of the situation and seize profits for themselves. However, this was discerned by our Northeast transportation authorities, who specially implemented price reductions and combined transportation on state-owned railways, reducing freight rates to 50% and reducing customs duties to 30%. For those going to Goubangzi, customs duties are completely waived. In terms of passenger tickets, those who hold reclamation farmer certificates are only charged 30% of the price, and ordinary passenger tickets that hold three-line intermodal transport tickets are also reduced by 20% to 30%. The above are all based on national currency, and two yuan of national currency is equivalent to one gold certificate. Due to the low freight rates of state-owned railways, which are very different from Mantetsu, domestic merchants have shifted their transportation trends. Mantetsu has been greatly impacted and its revenue has fallen sharply. However, the Japanese did not reflect on themselves and reduce freight rates to plan for the future of Mantetsu. They only blamed our transportation for not reducing transportation prices. This is truly unreasonable. Recently, the Japanese merchants in Sipingjie, an extraterritorial area only a short distance from Shenyang, witnessed that various commercial groups in the special zone transported products to Yingkou, Tianjin, and Guannei through the national road, with three or four cars being shipped out every day. Mantetsu, on the contrary, regarded this as a very serious problem and held a citizens' assembly for three days to study countermeasures against the competition of the Chinese railway and ways to save it. The first issue was the 50% reduction in freight rates on the Datong line. The final strategy was to arouse the popular propaganda of the entire Japanese opinion circle so that all the Japanese people would pay attention and enable the leaders of the Mantetsu headquarters to save it. Whether it can be effective depends on how it is implemented. Now, the comparison between the freight prices of each car on the state-owned railway three-line intermodal transport and Mantetsu shows that the difference is huge as follows: (1) The freight for one car of soybeans starting from Sipingjie Station, passing through the four Tao, Datong, Beining, and three lines connected by intermodal transport to Yingkou is 377.15 yuan in national currency. (2) The freight for one car of soybeans starting from Sipingjie Station directly from the Mantetsu line to Yingkou is 293.7 yuan in gold certificates, which should be converted to 564.8 yuan in silver dollars at a 52% discount. Therefore, it can save 188.65 silver dollars per car to reach Yingkou via the state-owned three-line road. Therefore, the Chinese people abandoned Mantetsu like discarding it, and there was not a single car loaded. Not only did the freight from Sipingjie to Yingkou decrease, but also the passenger tickets for passengers from Heilongjiang Province and west of Zhengjiatun who passed through Tianjin and Yingkou were all going down west. Therefore, the Japanese studied the reduction of fares on the Datong line by 50% to counter our state-owned railway. However, alleviating the economic suffering of some people, we do not hate the speculation of the Japanese and hope that they can realize it as soon as possible. (7th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Inspects the Naval Fleet</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: According to people from Huludao on the 5th, it rained heavily all night on the 3rd. Zhang Xueliang stayed on the island in the fourth floor of the railway club. On the morning of the 4th, the rain cleared. At 3:00 pm, Zhang, accompanied by Hu Ruoyu, Zhu Guangmu, Gao Jiyi, Yang Zhengzhi, and more than ten attendants, inspected the Northeast Navy fleets on the Hongji ship, accompanied by Shen Honglie. When Zhang arrived at the ship, all the ships raised flags and fired 17 salutes. The entire fleet performed the welcome ceremony on the ship. Shen Honglie and Ling Xiao, commander of the First Fleet, led Zhang into the commander's office for a short rest. All officers above the rank of deputy captain and chief engineer were promoted in turn. After the officials withdrew, they began to review the various forms. Next was the inspection of personnel and internal affairs. Then, they watched the joint fleet exercise on the deck of the Haiqi ship. The fleet exercise assumed that the Haiqi and Haishen ships were the A army, commanded by Ling Xiao, the captain of the Haiqi ship, and the Yongxiang and Chuyu ships were the B army, commanded by Liu Tianfu, the captain of the Zhenhai ship. All the soldiers cooperated, and the situation was very tense. For a time, the sound of cannons, the sound of orders, and the sound of military reports were heard, and planes circled in the sky and fired downwards and dropped bombs. The bombs fell into the water and emitted black smoke, which disappeared after two minutes. Gong Runxing, the deputy team leader of the Haiqi ship, who sank the Russian flagship in the Battle of Jiang, also participated in the exercise. The two sides fought fiercely until 5:40 pm before they stopped. Zhang praised all the soldiers. At 6:00 pm, Zhang had not yet left the ship to land. According to reports, the Haiqi ship is the largest cruiser in China, more than 420 feet long, with more than 20 large and small cannons and 5 torpedo cannons. More than 1,200 soldiers also participated in the actual exercise. Zhang is still on the island. It is rumored that Mr. Zhang went to Beidaihe for summer vacation after inspecting the navy on the afternoon of the 4th, but that statement is not accurate. (6th)</p>
<h3>Record of the Huludao Port Opening Ceremony (Continued)</h3>
<p>It was heard that the Port Authority was planning to visit the head of the office, Ning Mengyan, at the No. 1 office building on the seaside to discuss matters. Upon arriving at the No. 1 office building, it was discovered that it was the Dutch port management company. When asked about the Port Authority, the Chinese staff replied that it was at the No. 4 office building in Dongshan, already far away in the deep mountains. As the sun was setting, there would be no way to proceed if refused. Therefore, it was thought that the Naval Police School was closer to the No. 1 building, so a change of plan was made to go there. The principal, Wu Lixian, and the Dean of Education, Yang Changhou, were met, and they kindly agreed to arrange accommodation. According to Mr. Wu, the Naval Police School had been established for five years and was the first naval education institution in the Northeast. The first class of navigation and the second class of marine engineering had both graduated and been assigned to various coastal and river defense ships for training and service. The third class was also a navigation class and would not graduate until next year. This year, due to the Navy Department's order for the Bohai Fleet to take charge of Qingdao's coastal defense, the Naval Police students were transferred to Qingdao to study. Currently, the school only had a few dozen recruits left. Naval work was inherently difficult, and promotions were more difficult than in the army, but the pay was better. Sailors had to undergo four years of training before being promoted to Petty Officer Third Class, and being promoted to Sergeant First Class was already not easy. Although there were special merits that could lead to promotion to Lieutenant, such cases were rare. If there were vacancies for officers on the ships, they should be filled by the most outstanding students in service and academics. The school's annual expenses were about 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. The school site was borrowed from the Port Authority, and now, due to the urgent need for construction, it had to be relocated. Commander Shen planned to build a new school building in Dongshan, but the plans were still in progress. The Northeast naval system was divided into coastal defense and river defense groups. Zhang Xueliang concurrently served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bohai Fleet, and Shen Honglie was the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. There were a total of seven warships: Haiqi, Haichen, Zhaohao, Tongan, Zhenhai, Yongxiang, and Chuyu, with Haiqi being the largest, serving as an aircraft carrier. These seven warships were not enough to fulfill the responsibility of consolidating national defense, and there was an urgent need to add new ships. However, the Northeast's financial resources were insufficient, and with the rising price of gold, the current price of building ships was about 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per ton. Building a 10,000-ton warship would cost no less than 10 million yuan. The Northeast Navy's annual expenditure was more than 3 million yuan, which was not a small amount, but it was still far less than the Northeast Army's annual expenditure. Commander Shen, because Commander-in-Chief Zhang was attending the opening ceremony, led the Haiqi and other five ships from Qingdao to the island the day before. Tonight, there would be a banquet for Zhang at the school, after which he would board the Haichen warship because Zhang was going to observe naval anti-aircraft exercises tomorrow morning. Originally, it was scheduled to guide the guests to visit the warships immediately after the opening ceremony today, but the wind and waves were too strong, and it was quite dangerous to carry people in sampans, so it was canceled. Tomorrow's anti-aircraft plan was that Zhang would board the Haiqi warship at 5:00 AM, and Shen would order the Haichen to sail out of the port as an enemy warship. At this time, Zhang would inspect the Haiqi's internal affairs and the officers' and soldiers' duties. After 6:00 AM, the Haiqi dispatched two seaplanes, one for reconnaissance and one for bombing. More than ten minutes later, the reconnaissance plane returned to the ship and reported that an enemy warship was found more than ten nautical miles away. Upon receiving the report, the Haiqi immediately engaged the enemy. After the two sides approached, they began anti-aircraft exercises. Bombers soared over the enemy warship and dropped bombs. Reconnaissance planes frequently reported the enemy warship's movements to the home ship. At 11:00 AM, the enemy warship retreated, and the Haiqi returned to port in formation. The exercise was then completed. It was heard that Zhang was scheduled to visit Beidaihe on the fourth and then return to Liaoning.</p>
<p>After sunset, the Haiqi and other five ships emitted searchlights to inspect the entire island. The Naval Police School frequently used light signals to report that the island was safe. The station's lights were as bright as a picture. From the club to the foot of the mountain, several gasoline lamps were added. There was no power plant on the island yet. The station's lights were temporarily prepared by the railway bureau. The generator transported by the port management company had not yet been installed. At this time, taking off my coat to face the wind, the weather felt like late autumn. Listening quietly to the sound of the pines like rain and the chirping of insects like singing, the rushing sound of the waves and the barking of village dogs were also carried by the wind. Looking up at the crescent moon and the twinkling stars, one suddenly felt like transcending the world. Suddenly, a soldier shouted a password, which made one shudder. After 10:00 PM, the searchlights of the ships stopped, and the four large characters "Opening Ceremony Commemoration" formed by electric torches were displayed. Principal Wu, because it was late, sent Assistant Instructor Tao to guide me to rest at Captain Liu's residence.</p>
<p>On the third day, I woke up in the dim morning light. The rising sun had just appeared on the horizon, its color as red as a fireball. The sea water, reflecting it, shot out rays of light. The myriad green mountains seen yesterday were now shrouded in white clouds. The morning breeze felt refreshing. I toured the entire island to visit everything. Since the start of construction, the island had been showing a vibrant scene. More than 3,000 workers were engaged in the work of blasting mountains and filling the sea. There were more than a dozen earthen houses north of the station, all newly built, selling food, but there were no hotels yet. The post office and telegraph office had only been open for two days, and the stationmaster was still working on the train. There were three radio stations, two shortwave and one longwave, all under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Transportation Committee. The island's passenger train ran four times a day in each direction. The island's telephone was also temporarily installed by the port management company to facilitate office work. Most of the guests attending the ceremony were from the silver and business sectors, followed by the industrial sector. Most of these people wanted to take the opportunity of the ceremony to assess the situation and plan to buy land in preparation for future business operations. Upon arriving at the island, they realized that the 30 li of land had already been bought by the Port Authority. Now, it was only for rent, not for sale. The regulations for temporary land rental stipulated that the monthly rent was six yuan per mu for first-class land, five yuan per mu for second-class land, and four yuan per mu for third-class land. If the island's commercial market did not develop, that would be fine, but if it did, the land price would be monopolized by the Port Authority. Therefore, some people had already created an atmosphere, claiming that Huludao was not suitable for building commercial shops and should only be developed as a residential area, and that a commercial area should be developed in Lianshan. There were no bedbugs or mosquitoes on the island, but there were too many flies. The outer layer of each mountain was yellow sandy soil two or three feet thick, and inside was stone, so only green grass was seen, and there were no shady trees. There were some old trees that were leaning and slanting, no more than ten feet tall, which was the biggest shortcoming in terms of scenery. A few days ago, when the port management company was excavating Banlashan by the sea, a thousand-foot cliff was cut, overlooking the sea. Seven workers climbed bravely, but suddenly encountered a rock collapse, resulting in two deaths and five injuries. This was the third opening of the port. The first time, the injured had been admitted to the temporary hospital for treatment, and the dead had been buried. It was not known how the compensation would be handled, and there had been no news yet. There was also a major drinking water problem on the island that urgently needed to be solved, because the sea water was salty and bitter, and even after being filtered by sand, it was still unclean. Wells had recently been dug, but they only maintained the current situation. If the port developed in the future and the population increased to hundreds of thousands, there would be no way to solve the problem. Currently, the port management company planned to build natural reservoirs on the mountain tops, but this method had to go through three to five years of testing the natural rainfall before the drinking water supply standard could be determined. They were also afraid that this method would fail, so they also asked well-digging experts to survey the underground water sources in order to dig large wells. Ning Wu, courtesy name Mengyan, the head of the Huludao Port Authority, was the Chief Adjutant of the Northeast Border Defense Army Commander-in-Chief's Office and was very close to Gao Jiyi, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau. According to Mr. Ning, the main tasks of port construction were breakwaters, wharves, and sea walls. The breakwater was 7,600 feet long, the wharf was 4,600 feet long, and the sea wall was 2,360 feet long. The water depth at the wharf was 30 to 33 feet, which could accommodate ships of more than 50,000 tons. Currently, ordinary merchant ships were only 5,000 to 6,000 tons, with the largest being 12,000 tons. However, the Suez and Panama canals were only 27 feet deep, and large Western merchant ships were restricted by the two canals and could not come east. Therefore, the port's water depth of 33 feet was sufficient. The port area with a depth of 30 feet or more was 8 million square feet, which could accommodate 13 merchant ships of more than 5,000 tons at the same time and load 1.5 million tons of cargo per year. The first phase of port construction was leveling mountains and filling the sea, from May 1st to the end of June, which was the preparation period for the project. July 1st was the official start of work. The port management company had prepared cranes, rock drills, dredgers, locomotives, ships, dormitories, offices, factories, and hospitals and had made some progress. The earth-filling project had completed 60,000 cubic yards, and the wharf had completed more than 90 feet. Currently, they were blasting the rocks of Gaoliangduo Mountain and Banlashan. The first phase of the project was expected to take about one year. The second phase of construction was the wharf. The land-based construction, such as stations, railways, warehouses, and municipal planning, was all handled by the port staff, who were currently surveying and drawing. As soon as the drawings were completed, they would start planning and construction in sequence. The reporter, having completed his task, took a train to Lianshan on the same day and transferred to train No. 102 at 6:00 PM to enter the pass. He arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM on the fourth and recorded this to comfort the readers. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>Han Merchants Procure Sichuan Rice to Relieve Famine</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Recently, rice prices here have soared, greatly affecting the people's food supply. Rice merchants in Hankou are willing to raise funds themselves to procure rice from Wanxian, Chongqing, and other places in Sichuan, transport it to Hankou, and sell it at a fair price. They have submitted a request to the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce to notify General Liu in Chongqing, Commander Wang in Wanxian, and the two chambers of commerce in Chongqing and Wanxian to issue permits for transportation to avoid difficulties along the way. The Hankou Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving the request, praised the merchants for raising funds to procure Sichuan rice to relieve the famine and specifically notified the Sichuan side with a letter that read, "We are writing to inform you that we have recently received a stamped request from rice merchants in Hankou, including Yu Maoqian, Xin Tai, and Xie Changxiang, stating that the source of rice is scarce, the price is rising, and the people are having difficulty obtaining food. They request permission to procure Sichuan rice, transport it to Hankou, and sell it at a fair price to help the people's livelihood. We have learned that Wuhan's rice supply has always been sourced from Hunan and Jiangxi, but the source has been interrupted, and the price has suddenly risen, causing great difficulty for the people's food supply. The merchants, in view of this, are willing to raise funds themselves to procure 5,000 shi of Sichuan rice from Wanxian and Chongqing, transport it to Hankou, and sell it at a fair price. They fear that the truth may not be clear in the area, causing obstruction. Therefore, they request that the Chamber of Commerce issue a letter to notify the two chambers of commerce in Wanxian and Chongqing, as well as General Liu, Commander of the 21st Army in Chongqing, and Commander Wang of the Wanxian Command, to allow transportation and issue passports to avoid difficulties along the way and help the people's livelihood and maintain the people's food supply, which is a public good. The Wuhan people's food supply is already showing signs of famine, and the merchants' plan to raise funds to procure Sichuan rice is a matter of urgency. In addition to issuing separate letters, we are writing to request that you investigate and provide passports if the merchants come to Sichuan to procure rice to ensure and alleviate the neighboring famine. We would be grateful." The Hankou General Chamber of Commerce, in order to relieve the rice famine and suppress the price of rice, had resolved to procure 1,000 shi of Xiaojiao rice from Shanghai and sell it at a fair price in Hankou. It has been implemented since the sixth, and about 1,000 bags have been sold in the past three days. The two directors, Wang Linfu and Li Dezhai, personally supervised everything. The price was 760 yuan per sheng, which was less than 16 yuan per shi. For those who bought whole shi, it was 16 yuan and 5 jiao. According to the cost in Shanghai, each shi was losing more than one yuan. The rice was about the same quality as the third-grade rice from machine rice mills. The fair price sale was from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM. It was heard that 2,500 bags of rice had arrived, and at least 10,000 bags were still to come. If the price could not be stabilized, procurement would have to continue.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express Letter</h3>
<p>This morning at 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life held a memorial meeting for the fourth anniversary of the Northern Expedition of the 79th Revolutionary Army at the Song and Dance Theater on Zhongshan Road. More than 200 representatives attended. The chairman of the Municipal Party Committee reported on the Revolutionary Army's suppression of reactionaries and completion of the National Revolution, as well as the process of launching the Northern Expedition. He also said that the Revolutionary Army was still continuing to eliminate counter-revolutionary work and hoped that the people would unanimously support it. All organs and groups stopped working, and all stores in the city closed for one day to celebrate, as announced by the General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Anhui Finance Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance recently stated that the remittance of funds from various likin bureaus was too delayed, and it would be difficult to improve tax revenue without fundamental rectification. It was decided to convene a meeting of likin bureau chiefs on the 21st of this month. Yesterday, telegrams had been sent to the 37 likin bureau chiefs in Anhui, instructing them to attend the meeting in Wuhu on time and without delay.</p>
<p>Sun Gongming, the magistrate of Wuhu County, received an order from the province to clean up all public properties in the county. Sun has convened various groups in the county to organize a public property cleanup committee, which is scheduled to be established on the 14th to clean up separately.</p>
<p>Small steamships operating in Wuhu, Neihe, Nanling, Xuanzhou, and other places are now experiencing higher water levels than in previous years due to the backflow of the river tide and the influx of mountain floods. The dikes along the river are in imminent danger. All small steamships have successively suspended operations in compliance with customs restrictions.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Tongji Ferry Company, recognizing that there are thousands of people traveling between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River in Wuhu every day, and that small boats are dangerous due to the wide river surface, purchased small steamships to start a ferry service. Previously, a dispute arose with the "Zhenjie" rowing gang, and the ferry service was suspended again. Later, the Municipal Affairs Office convened several meetings and decided that the ferry company would subsidize the interests of the rowing gang before the service was peacefully restored. However, yesterday, the pontoon of the ferry's north bank dock was suddenly destroyed, causing the ferry service to stop again. The Municipal Affairs Office, which had been collecting municipal donations from passengers since the ferry service was established, was obliged to mediate. (9th)</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Goods Touring Group Arrives in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao City Holds National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: This national goods exhibition in Qingdao is unprecedented in North China. The Shanghai National Goods Touring Group, with more than 100 members, also arrived in Qingdao a few days ago to prepare for participation. At 10:00 AM today (the 7th), party and government organs and representatives from all walks of life gathered at the Qi Yan Hall to hold the opening ceremony of the National Goods Exhibition Hall and the National Goods Exhibition. The presidium consisted of Mayor Ge Jingen, Municipal Steering Committee member Yang Xingqin, Social Affairs Bureau Director Yang Jin, General Chamber of Commerce member Ding Jingchen, and Shanghai National Goods Touring Group Chairman Chen Pengru. After the opening meeting, Chairman Yang Jin reported first, stating that the National Goods Exhibition Hall was reorganized from the former Commodity Exhibition Hall and had been in preparation for several months. The opening could not be held earlier because the national goods solicited from various places had not arrived completely. Although the exhibits had not all arrived, they were mostly ready. As for the National Goods Exhibition, it was scheduled to be held once a year according to the regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, on the one hand, to let the public know how many national goods there were, and on the other hand, for the government to reward them. But the current exhibition was a kind of national goods mobile exhibition. This kind of exhibition had been held in Jiangsu Province several times, and the results were very good. The first was the "China Exhibition" held in Shanghai by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce the year before last. The largest was last year's "West Lake Exhibition," and the most recent was last month's "Nanjing Silk Exhibition." Henan, Hunan, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Hangzhou had also held exhibitions. Because of historical reasons, Qingdao City was flooded with foreign goods and had few national goods, so it was urgent to promote them. After this exhibition, the Chinese people would know the benefits of national goods and would use national goods, which would not be in vain for today's meeting. Then, Committee Member Yang and Mayor Ge gave speeches. Finally, Shanghai National Goods Touring Group Chairman Chen Peng reported that the group had originally planned to go to Guangdong first, but because they received a letter from the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau inviting them to Qingdao, they decided to come to Qingdao first to participate in the promotion. He was grateful for the guidance of all parties. Regarding manufacturing, he would strive for excellence after returning to Shanghai to meet the expectations of the people. The significance of this tour was to conduct practical investigations into the needs of the people in various places and then seek the development of national goods. After the closing meeting, the entire group went to the National Goods Exhibition Hall together to hold the opening ceremony, then went to each exhibition room to visit various national goods samples and take photos as souvenirs. At that time, the number of people who came to view and shop had already been unceasing. It was found that a total of 36 factories had come to Qingdao this time. The names of each factory and the types of products were investigated as follows: Shengde Weaving Factory (silk fabrics, artificial ivory chopsticks), Gongzu Footwear Factory (silk socks), Zhenhua Pottery Factory (Yixing pottery), Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory (cloth), Ruyi Xiang Factory (silverware), Dahua Industrial Factory (thread crepe silk), Liyong Pottery Factory (Yixing pottery), Peide Tie and Shirt Factory (shirts and ties), Huadong Manufacturing Factory (Huadong crepe), Yao Chuanhong Lacquerware Factory (art lacquerware), May 30th National Goods Company (Hangzhou paper umbrellas), Guangshengyuan Food Company (candies and food), Wuzhou Guben Medicine Soap Factory (cosmetics and medicines), West Lake Tea Factory (tea and lotus root flour), Brothers Industrial Society (cosmetics), Senyuanxiang Jewelry Factory (jewelry), Yuan Zhenhe Silk Factory (silk fabrics), Chen Yuanxing Comb Factory (Changzhou combs), Longxingxiang Copper Factory (copperware), Chunhua Silk Factory (silk fabrics), Lin Rattanware Factory (rattan willow ware), Dacheng Weaving Factory (cotton silk fabrics), New World Umbrella Factory (umbrellas), Zhenhua Paint Company (Flying Tiger paint), Xiangtai Manufacturing Factory (silk undershirts, socks, and pants), China Celluloid Factory (tableware), Qida Silk Weaving Factory (silk woven scenery), Nanyang Tobacco Company (cigarettes), Qiming Dyeing and Weaving Factory (cloth), Yapuer Electric Bulb Factory (light bulbs), China Enamel Factory (enamelware), Taikang Food Company (canned food), Meixia Silk Factory (silk fabrics), Samsung Cotton Iron Factory (cotton fabrics, towels), Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory (cloth), Dazhong Towel Factory (towels), Baofa Sauce Essence Factory (soy sauce essence), Wuhe Manufacturing Factory (cotton fabrics) (July 7th)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Express Letter</h3>
<p>Serious bandit alerts have been repeatedly reported in Jiande County, and rumors are rampant. Several hundred people from the county have come to Hangzhou to seek temporary shelter. The province has dispatched the third regiment of the Security Team, led by Zhu, to suppress the bandits. They have departed in batches over the past few days.</p>
<p>Lanxi, in eastern Zhejiang, is a region specializing in ham and cured meat production. The Department of Finance has proposed to increase the donation rate. Industry colleagues have elected representatives from Yuanfa to telegram a request for exemption in order to alleviate business difficulties. Yesterday, a reply was received stating that ham and cured meat are not essential foods, as everyone knows, and are classified as semi-luxury goods. The added tax is very small. If the industry can pay attention to improving the quality of products and sell them overseas, they will be welcomed. There is no need to worry about the encroachment of American and Japanese hams. Please advise and explain in detail, and do not hesitate and wait and see.</p>
<p>There are fourteen banks in Hangzhou, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Local Bank, Industrial Bank, Xingye Bank, Huidi Bank, Chufeng Bank, Dianye Bank, Savings Bank, Daoyi Bank, Salt Bank, Continental Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and Central Bank. The industry originally established a guild, which was canceled long ago. Now, the Bank of China, Local Bank, Huidi Bank, Xingye Bank, and other banks have initiated the legal organization of a trade association, which is currently in preparation.</p>
<p>The Department of Finance received a telegram from the Jiaxing Unified Donation Bureau requesting instructions on whether Minfeng Paper Company's machine-made Western-style paper goods could be exempted from donations. It was found that Minfeng Paper Factory was established on the old site of Hefeng and Jincheng factories, and the paper produced was machine-made and imitated Western goods. It should be handled in accordance with the previous case of Hefeng and Jincheng factories, allowing exemption from donations. The waste paper from raw materials can also be exempted from donations in accordance with the previous case of Jincheng Factory. The Ministry of Finance will also be consulted for instructions.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Summary of County Government County Administration Meeting: The County Government held its 65th County Administration Meeting yesterday, chaired by County Magistrate Jin. Matters discussed: (1) The Public Security Bureau submitted a case stating that the drum towers in the four cities were old and dilapidated and would collapse, requesting demolition to avoid danger. It was decided that the county magistrate should order the Construction Bureau to investigate and estimate the demolition costs and the price of old materials to offset the profits and losses and submit a report for review. (2) The Construction Bureau proposed that the city gates of the four cities were old and dilapidated, severely corroded, and difficult to open and close. Now that the barbican has been demolished, it should be repaired urgently to strengthen the city's defenses. All the construction costs are planned to be offset by the wood from the barbican city gate. If there is a shortfall, it will be supplemented by the bricks and stones from the demolition of the barbican. Is it feasible to ask for a public decision? It was decided that the county magistrate should order the Construction Bureau to estimate the price and submit a report for review.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Association Limits Price for Fair Sale: The Rice Merchants Association of this city was previously advised by the county government to limit the price and sell at a fair price. Later, out of consideration for public opinion and the poor, they all agreed to automatically sell at a fair price. Yesterday, a meeting was held at the County Chamber of Commerce to first vote on which method was more appropriate, fair price or rice distribution. It was unanimously decided to sell at a fair price. It was then decided that the limited price of Du rice should not exceed 21 yuan per shi, and Xiang rice should be sold at a price reduction of two yuan per city price. A total of 4,000 yuan was allocated to open sales in the three temples of Dongmen, Cangqiao, and other four bureaus. Each person could buy from one jin to ten jin without needing a certificate to maintain the livelihood of small artisans. The fair sale was held at the same time as the government-regulated fair price period. After the general discussion, a committee meeting was held today to discuss the detailed rules of the affair and was named the Songjiang Rice Merchants Association Fair Price Office, which has already been prepared and is in progress.</p>

<p>Mother and Son Killed by Train: Yesterday (the 11th), the first express train from Shanghai to Beijing drove to Yangqiao outside Qimen. A mother and son, whose names were unknown, were walking on the bridge and could not avoid being hit by the wheels and falling into the river, where they were injured and killed. The local Bao of the area immediately reported to the local court to send someone to inspect.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Stolen Ancient Paintings Recovered: Xu Wuqi, a former gentleman in Dongtang Street in the city, had a large collection of Yuan and Ming ancient paintings. Last month, more than ten ancient paintings were suddenly stolen by thieves. The value was huge. He immediately reported to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation. Wei, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, learned that the ancient paintings were stolen by Yao Gengquan, a carpenter in the case. He immediately sent detectives to arrest him. The criminal had already fled after hearing the news. Yao's father, Longhai, was arrested for the case. According to his confession, he was instigated by two Wu brothers who were at large. According to his confession, Chief Wei immediately presented Yao to the county government on the tenth and continued to strictly arrest the Wu brothers who were at large and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Another Kidnapping Case in Qidun Township: At about 1:00 AM the night before last, two bandit ships suddenly arrived at Taojiaqiao in Qidun Township of the County Bureau. There were more than ten bandits on board, each with guns and weapons. After landing, they entered Chen Yushu's house and kidnapped Chen's two grandsons from the bed without asking why and took them to the ship. They then went to Xu Jianxian's house and kidnapped Xu, declaring that they needed to prepare 10,000 yuan to redeem them at a certain place. The bandit ship passed through Nantangdun Village and kidnapped two Yao children. Afterwards, each master reported to the fourth district chief, Zhu Wenyuan, requesting him to forward the report to the county government for strict arrest.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Passenger Dies of Heat Stroke at Wharf: Zhao Baochang, a 46-year-old from Huzhou, Zhejiang, came to Jiang from Shanghai a few days ago to visit the family members of his former master, Qian Gang. He stayed at the Hongan Hotel on Beizha Street. On the morning of the ninth, Zhao Chenzhou went to the Beimen wharf to return to Huzhou.

<p>Change of Police Chief: Huang Zhenbai, the Wuxi County Police Chief, has served since his appointment for almost five months. Recently, due to the overwhelming workload of handling wounded soldiers' reception, and the various criticisms arising from the conscription of laborers, Huang specifically submitted a request to the county government, which was forwarded to the provincial government, firmly requesting to resign from his post.

He requested the dispatch of police to arrest them. Chief Mao, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered detective chief Ni Gusheng to lead detectives to investigate. When they arrived at the location, they saw three fishing boats and knew they were not good people.

<p>Carpenters' Strike: Wuyi County carpenters demanded a 30% increase in wages from shop owners due to the rising cost of living, referencing the precedent set by the bricklayers. The carpenters' original wages were 60 cents per day, and a 30% increase would bring it to 78 cents. The shop owners only agreed to add 10 cents per day for rice subsidies. After repeated negotiations, both parties submitted requests to the county government and the Construction Bureau for review. The carpenters, seeing no decision made by the 10th, went on strike.</p>

Suddenly, on the evening of the 7th, more than ten bandits armed with guns and speaking with a Henan accent broke into the door. Xu knew something was wrong and escaped to the back. The bandits went inside and arbitrarily searched and looted all the clothes, rice, and other items. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the same bandits came again and went straight in through the front door to the bedroom and fired two shots. Xu knew he could not avoid it, so he came out from behind the curtain and knelt down, begging repeatedly, and took out 50 yuan in banknotes and handed it over. The bandits then fired a warning shot and left.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob in Broad Daylight: Shen Anbao, a resident of Fancun in the southwestern countryside of Wuxing, had been cutting trees for others in the mountains of Heping. On the 8th of this month, he was carrying a bag of clothes home. At about 2 PM, about three miles away from Hejiabu, he suddenly encountered two bandits in short clothes blocking his way.

Recently, due to a major case, the victim's family and business associations have filed complaints with the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Department of Civil Affairs. It is now reported that the Department of Civil Affairs has ordered the Jiaxing County Government to investigate and report back for review.

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Disturbances Caused by Forced Donations by Village Farmers' Associations: The farmers' associations in the four townships of Xiaoshan have recently been collecting membership fees, ranging from four cents to one dime per person per month. Recently, they have been adding special donations of five or ten yuan to those who appear to be better off. The farmers cannot bear the burden. At this busy time for farmers, they often borrow the power of the farmers' associations to intimidate them. Their evil methods are even worse than the previous forced rice collection by evil landlords. Such extortion has been discovered in Dongcaodun, Shu, and other villages. It is reported that farmers have sent representatives to the provincial government to appeal for help. It is unknown how the provincial government will support the farmers.</p>
<p>Investigation and Punishment of Illegal Activities by Two Village Chiefs: Xu Nailian, the village chief of Wutu Village in Xiaoshan, illegally collected report fees of two dimes and two cents per mu when handling land reports, which violated provincial orders. After Sun Yuanshun and others filed a complaint with the provincial and county governments, County Magistrate Du sent someone to secretly investigate and found that it was true. He has been handed over to the court for prosecution. Xu Bingkui, the village chief of Xuanling Village, was dismissed and investigated by the county government for fraudulent low-price grain sales.</p>
<p>Arrest and Public Display of Thieves Who Kidnap and Steal Low-Price Grain Coupons: Since the opening of low-price grain sales in Xiaoshan on June 5, some kidnappers and thieves have been deceiving women and children to seize their profits.

The villager reported to the police, who arrested him near the motor road. He was immediately displayed to the public at the low-price grain bureau, paraded through the streets for a day, and then released.</p>

<h3>Japanese Swimming Making Great Strides</h3>
<p>Two Years of Preparation and Hard Training</p>
<p>The Sole Purpose is World Hegemony</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent) The Japanese Aquatic Sports Federation held a board meeting on July 5 to prepare for this year's championship. The meeting concluded that, in light of recent surprising progress, such as reducing the 1500 meters to 19 minutes, the 400 meters to 5 minutes, and breaking 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the 200 meters, and with a number of emerging talents, it is optimistic about winning the 1500-meter and 800-meter relay swimming championships at the World Olympics to be held in two years. As for the Olympic men's swimming events, which are the 100-meter, 400-meter, 1500-meter freestyle, 100-meter backstroke, 200-meter breaststroke, and 800-meter relay, the United States specializes in freestyle and backstroke, but the breaststroke is not as good as Japan's, Germany's or the Philippines', so Japan is determined to work hard to encourage the old and new to train diligently. There is great hope of seizing world swimming hegemony. With ambitious aspirations thundering, the next competition is a golden opportunity. They advocated two years of training preparation with the Olympics as the primary goal. In the future, various competition events will focus on the World Championship events. The entire venue unanimously decided to actively work hard and forge ahead.</p>
<h3>World Heavyweight Boxing</h3>
<p>Controversy Over the Championship</p>
<p>The British Boxing Board of Control declared that it does not recognize Schmeling's acquisition of the world heavyweight championship. German sports circles were surprised. The British claimed that Scott, who was previously defeated by Sharkey in a decision, should be honored with the championship.</p>
<p>According to referees, notaries, and spectators, Sharkey completely defeated Scott, so the British statement seems to be an exaggeration to support their own athletes and to hype up the upcoming match between Scott and Stubeling on July 18 to attract more spectators and ticket sales.</p>

<h3>Japanese Athletes Depart for the World Women's Games</h3>
<p>Six Female Generals to the Czech Republic on July 25th</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent) The Japanese team selected six representatives for the third International Women's Games to be held in Prague, Czech Republic this year. Details have been published in this newspaper on the 9th of this month. It is now known that the athlete team has appointed the former Far East famous sprinter Tani Mitsu as the person in charge of guidance. They have been camping and practicing at the Miyoshi sports field in the United States for more than a month. Their spirit of hard work and diligence is unmatched even by our country's male athletes. On the 26th and 27th of last month, they held tryouts to record the final records, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>100 meters Hitomi 12.4 seconds</p>
<p>Watanabe, Nakanishi 13 seconds</p>
<p>Muraoka, Honjo 13.1 seconds</p>
<p>Hamasaki 13.4 seconds</p>
<p>60 meters Hitomi 8 seconds</p>

<p>High Jump 1.40 meters</p>
<p>Javelin 23.50 meters</p>
<p>According to Coach Tani, during this 40-day training period, all the female athletes were very serious and obedient to the guidance, so the posture and running method have been corrected one by one, and the results have greatly improved compared to before. Hitomi can often break 12 seconds in the 100 meters, and each person can also create a record of 13 seconds at their best. Hitomi has the experience and qualification of attending two sessions, and she is experienced. She is quite confident in winning the 200 meters, long jump, and heptathlon. Hitomi's three events have broken her own world record of 217 points with 239 unofficial points. Although the other athletes are newcomers, the same is true for all countries. If Japanese women can show their spirits and work hard when they arrive at the conference, they will definitely achieve a satisfactory result and exhale for the women's world in East Asia.</p>

<h3>Chinese Expeditionary Soccer Team Departs Hong Kong for Singapore</h3>
<p>Hundreds of People Send Off... Liang Rongde Selected to Join the Expedition</p>
<p>This Trip Fulfills the Wish to Conquer Europe... We Will See a Different Team Upon Their Return</p>
<p>(Hong Kong News) The expeditionary soccer team, composed of our country's soccer players to compete abroad, departed from Hong Kong on the 5th to head to Southeast Asia. The players on this expeditionary team are composed of athletes from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Java. By measuring talent and using it, it can be considered satisfactory. However, many athletes who are skilled and talented were unable to participate in this event due to obstacles. It is regrettable that this team is also very strong in combat power and will not be diminished due to those who were unable to attend. It is expected that this trip will leave a good impression on European and American people and increase glory in international sports. After the Yuehua players arrived in Hong Kong, they held a meeting in Hong Kong and made preparations for the journey. There was a sense of impending departure. When the players were selected in Hong Kong, it was decided that Cao and Chen would go together on the wings. In the end, after deliberations, in addition to Sun, Cai, and Chen, there were few materials for midfielders to replenish. Liang Rongde from South China was willing to follow the expedition, so another strong member was added. After the team was properly prepared, it was sent off on the Guamanara liner at noon on the 5th. On that day, hundreds of people, including the Nan Hua, Chung Wah, and other sports organizations, as well as relatives and friends of the players, and the entire student body of Sacred Heart College, sent them off. Mr. Liang Rongde is a teacher at Sacred Heart College. The students of the school believed that Liang's efforts in international sports would bring glory to the school, so they all sent him off. The reporter also wishes the team success on this trip and hopes that they will not only pioneer a new era in the history of our country's soccer but also learn from others' strengths to make up for their own weaknesses and return to irrigate the country's people to jointly move forward on the road to sports development.</p>
<h3>London Will Have</h3>
<h3>New Style of British Football</h3>
<p>The London Howard Enterprise Group, known for its efforts to promote sports, is now planning to introduce a new style of six-a-side soccer and is preparing to test the match between Leyton and Galston in Layton next month. An agreement has also been reached, and they are actively working with the relations of the White City and Wembley stadiums to promote this skill.</p>
<p>This new style of soccer is organized with six players per team, one goalkeeper, one defender, and three forwards. During the match, all members, referees, and linesmen wear masks and plan to provide bonuses to attract top players to participate. They now want to use four courts to hold a championship with a reward of 1,000 pounds for the final to attract the interest of the audience.</p>
<p>The teams plan to use playing cards as their representative names. If the negotiations with Wembley are successful, Wembley will be named "Ace", White City will be named "King", Galston will be named "Queen", and Layton will be named "Jacks". Each team takes turns playing against each other. The field is 80 yards long and 60 yards wide. The match time is usually 90 minutes, which is divided into 15 minutes. However, shots are only allowed to be scored from within the penalty line. If the two teams are tied, the winner is determined by the number of corner kicks.</p>
<p>According to Howard, who promotes this new style of soccer, many stars are now willing to participate. Although the members wear masks for the first test run, their true identities will be revealed in the future.</p>
<p>However, the Football Association stipulates that players are not allowed to participate in six-a-side exhibition matches after the end of the season. Those who violate this will be subject to exile and removal. As for those who promote this new game, they claim that they are confident that they can solicit first-class players and will never extend their membership to any team. Moreover, many stars have signed up to serve at any time, and the competition can be held at any time. They firmly believe that this new style of six-a-side soccer will definitely develop and succeed in the future.</p>

<p>Group C Champion: Cheng Zhen Hua</p>
<p>Challenge Match to be Held Next Friday</p>
<p>The YMCA-sponsored Shanghai Singles Handball Championship was divided into three groups (A, B, and C), with enthusiastic participation. Hong E Qing, Gu Yong Zhao, and Zhu Kuan were appointed as committee members, with Ling Xi Tao as the general secretary. The event concluded successfully, with players displaying spirited and persistent efforts throughout the competition. The final matches for each group were held at the YMCA handball court yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, drawing a large and enthusiastic crowd. Hong Yu Kui defeated Sun Dao Sheng to win the Group A championship, Hong Ru Lin defeated Lu Ai Bai to win the Group B championship, and Cheng Zhen Hua defeated Luo Shun Da to win the Group C championship. The results of each group are summarized below:</p>
<p>Group A: Hong Yu Kui Defeats Sun Dao Sheng</p>
<p>11-1, 11-9, 11-9</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, Hong and Sun of Group A took to the stage. Both players were highly skilled. Sun, the veteran, played aggressively, winning the first game 11-1, seemingly poised to seize the championship. However, his stamina waned, and he became fatigued. Hong, young and strong, with vigorous energy, attacked from both sides, overwhelming Sun. Hong won the next two games 11-9, 11-9, reversing the situation to win the championship. Sun's loss was due to a lack of physical strength, not a lack of fighting spirit. The referees were Zhu Kuan and Ling Xi Tao, and the recorder was Chen Yu Zhang.</p>
<p>Group B: Hong Ru Lin Defeats Lu Ai Bai</p>
<p>22-20, 21-9</p>
<p>After the Group A match, the Group B match began, featuring Hong Ru Lin against Lu Ai Bai. Hong is the brother of Group A champion Hong Yu Kui and is also highly skilled. He maintained momentum after the game started. Lu Ai Bai showed some resistance, however, the tension of the hard game continued to mount. Hong won the first game 22-20. In the second game, Hong's momentum increased, and he became unstoppable, while Lu's form deteriorated, losing 21-9. Hong Ru Lin won the championship 2-0.</p>
<p>Group C: Cheng Zhen Hua Defeats Luo Shun Da</p>
<p>21-14, 21-3</p>
<p>Cheng Zhen Hua won the Group C championship effortlessly. Cheng's skill is so advanced that he could easily stand out even in Group B. His opponent, Luo Shun Da, although defeated, fought hard and persevered until the end. The scores were 21-14, 21-3.</p>
<p>Challenge Match Next Friday</p>
<p>General Zhu Kuan to Compete</p>
<p>A Challenge Contest will be held next Friday. General Zhu Kuan will compete against Group A champion Hong Yu Kui. Group A runner-up Sun Dao Sheng will compete against Group B champion Hong Ru Lin. Group B runner-up Lu Ai Bai will compete against Group C champion Cheng Zhen Hua. It will be a clash of talents, a battle of equals, promising a grand spectacle and a new era for handball in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>City Amateur Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Despite the hot weather yesterday, the amateur tennis tournament at the City Public Stadium proceeded on schedule. The results of yesterday's matches and the schedule for this afternoon and tomorrow morning are listed below:</p>

<p>Referee Hou Shang Xiong</p>
<p>Fang    Tang Zhi Ming defeats He Er Kun    2-6, 7-5, 6-2</p>
<p>Referee Zhang Long Hai</p>
<p>The match between Hu Hua Qin and Gong Zhen Yi lasted the longest, as both players were skilled at defense but weak at offense. Many rallies went back and forth before a point was decided. They were both persistent and ran tirelessly, so the match lasted more than 5-7 volleys before a set could be determined. The game started at 5:30 PM the day before and continued until dusk, with each player winning one set. The deciding set was played yesterday afternoon. Initially, the score was tied 2-2, but then Hu went on a roll, winning four sets in a row. By the end, he was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>Wang Yuan Yin and Liu Quan Zhou are newcomers to the tennis world, with limited experience, but they have made rapid progress. Their technique is improving daily, and they are skilled at both forehand and backhand, and attacking and defending from all positions. Yesterday's match was particularly exciting, drawing praise from the audience. Liu was not at his best due to a lack of recent practice, leading to Wang's victory with scores of 6-2 and 6-3.</p>

<h3>National Hangzhou Art College to Japan for Study</h3>
<p>The National Hangzhou Art College's delegation to Japan for the study of art education has sent a special letter back to China reporting on their activities in Japan. They arrived in Nagasaki on the 28th, and in Kobe the next day, taking a train to Tokyo that evening. Officials from the Cultural Affairs Department and the Japanese Embassy hosted the group. Dozens of reporters took photographs and interviewed the members, keeping them busy. They stayed at the Japan-China Association that night and visited various places the next afternoon. The results were very satisfactory. Clippings and photos from Japanese newspapers were sent, showing the grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Summer School Opens</h3>
<p>The Anhui Summer School started classes on the 8th and held an opening ceremony on the 9th. A total of 267 people registered: 148 in the elementary education group, 93 in the educational administration group, and 26 in the physical education group. The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 AM on the 9th, with several members of the provincial government and party committee, as well as guests, attending. Cheng Tianfang, Chairman of the Provincial Party Committee, and Jin Weixi, among others, gave speeches. One or two instructors also gave speeches. The ceremony ended with a photo session at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Strictly Limits Private School Registration</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has clearly set deadlines for the registration of private schools at all levels in all regions and has issued instructions for compliance. The Ministry has instructed education departments in each province and municipality to investigate the large number of private schools at all levels in their areas. The Ministry has repeatedly ordered these schools to register according to regulations. Some schools have submitted registration applications, but others are waiting to see what happens. This delay is unacceptable and should be strictly addressed by setting clear deadlines to ensure compliance. The deadline for registration of private schools at all levels in the capital is the end of this summer vacation, i.e., before the start of the first semester of the 19th year of the Republic, as previously ordered by the Ministry. The registration deadline for all other private schools should be determined by the education departments of each province and municipality, taking into account the specific circumstances. The deadline should be no later than the end of the next summer vacation, i.e., the day before the start of the first semester of the 20th year of the Republic. Schools that fail to register by the deadline should be ordered by the education departments of each province and municipality to suspend enrollment or close down. However, private schools in military, disaster, or remote areas that are unable to register on time due to special circumstances may have their deadlines extended by the education departments of each province and municipality with the approval of the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Recovering Education Rights in Concessions</h3>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government to Find Ways</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau previously petitioned the Ministry of Education to request the recovery of education rights in concessions. The Ministry of Education forwarded the petition to the Executive Yuan and sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now replied to the Ministry of Education, stating that it would be easier to recover education rights in concessions if the Shanghai Municipal Government negotiated with the concession authorities to find remedies. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>County Education Bureau Plans to Increase Education Funding for This Year</h3>
<p>Plans to Add a Percentage from Salt Price Increase</p>
<p>The plan is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau believes that the county's land tax has already been increased to 16 cents per mu, imposing a heavy burden on farmers, and that further increases are difficult. However, increased education funding is necessary. It is proposed that the county, together with nearby counties, request an additional percentage of the salt price increase for education funding this year. Other possible sources of funding are being explored. The plan is currently under discussion and will be submitted to the provincial authorities for approval after a decision has been made.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Elementary School Entrance Exam Results Announced</h3>

Overall, the results appear to be improved compared to last year. Graduation certificates should be collected from the bureau by the principals of each school.</p>
<h3>Strict Enrollment at Wuben Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>The Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School has a long history and a high reputation in society. The current principal is Wang Xiaoying. At the beginning of the school year, the entrance examination for new students is very strict. Graduates of the school's elementary and junior high schools with academic performance in the top grade can directly enter the corresponding grade. All others must undergo the same examination procedures as new students. The percentage of continuing students is generally 27%, while the percentage of new students is 73%. The school hopes to achieve uniform academic standards and practical learning within three years. Seven or eight hundred people applied for the exam this time. The exams for the first and second grades of junior high school were completed in one day, and the exams for the first and second grades of senior high school were held over two days. Yesterday was the first day of the new student exams. There were six examination rooms, all sealed, with strict invigilation and a solemn atmosphere. Although the weather was hot and candidates were sweating profusely, their spirits were high as they competed for this one day. The results will be announced after evaluation. The second examination period is expected to be in mid-August.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Registration for Shanghai High School Summer School</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Provincial High School Summer School is scheduled to begin on July 12th. Since registration began, the number of students registering has been quite high. In the last day or two, the school has been particularly crowded. As of noon on the 9th, over 400 people had paid their fees, and students continued to register in large numbers. It seems that the capacity of the junior high school may not be enough to accommodate everyone.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>A Word of Insight·Long</p>
<p>Sunday, a day for indulging and rampant vices for Chinese people, rarely has any meaning of rest.</p>
<p>People only know the good of "having a son makes everything complete," but rarely know the freedom of being debt-free.</p>
<p>Living on loans is no better than drinking poison to quench thirst, because the interest generates more interest, inevitably leading to greater debt and no hope of repayment.</p>
<p>In the past, people read to understand principles, so there were sages in every generation. Nowadays, people study to become officials, leading to a decline in morality.</p>
<p>If our country's officials and merchants could turn their methods of deceiving compatriots to dealing with foreigners, the country's strength might have some hope of revival.</p>
<p>The psychology of fashionable women is like the unpredictable weather of the plum rain season.</p>
<p>To know if the war news reported in the newspaper is accurate, one must wait until the internal conflicts are resolved. So, during this period, it's better to read Free Talk to relieve boredom.</p>
<p>Misses wear high-heeled shoes to elevate their status and because they are troubled by their short height, trying to compete with mesdames in height.</p>
<p>If everyone wants to find someone more talented and beautiful than themselves as a companion, it will be in vain even with a lantern, because even if you find someone better than you, they will also turn a blind eye to you because they are looking for someone better than them.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of the Chinese Exhibition and Fair During the Belgian Independence Anniversary</h3>
<p>Hu Danqing, from Liege, Belgium</p>
<p>China's participation in the Belgian Centennial Independence Exhibition officially opened on the 16th of this month in Liege, Belgium. The exhibition is beautifully arranged, with vermilion columns and yellow palace lanterns all around. The exhibits are divided into five sections: one section for the Siku Beiyao (Complete Library in Four Sections) and writing tools and books, one section for embroidery and silk, one section for cloisonné and jade porcelain, and one section for silkworm cocoons and plant specimens. The central hall features a portrait of the Premier and the party and national flags. The hall is furnished with rosewood furniture, and the walls are decorated with embroidery. The area occupied by our exhibition is small, but it is dazzling, beautiful, and captivating, drawing praise from all who see it.</p>
<p>That evening, Chu Minyi hosted a banquet for the representatives of various delegations and Belgian celebrities. After the banquet, a fair was held at the Jardin d’Acclimation. The program included a flag presentation and the singing of the national anthem, clear singing of "The Civet Cat Prince for a Baby" by Ms. He Liangnan and Mr. Liu Xiutong, tai chi ball and tai chi stick performance by Chu Minyi, "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom" by Shen Chenglin, Chen Zhaoyu, Jin Yuzhang, and Zhuang Zhengbang, "Dumu Pass" by Chu Minyi, piano performance by Hu Shengfu, "Daiyu Burying Flowers" by Ms. Yang and Ms. Ma, "Daiyu Burying Flowers" by Ms. Xu Shiqi and Ms. Tong Xiuman, Jian Tzi performance by Shen Chenglin and Wu Peilang, "Sparrow and Child" by Ms. Qian Xiuling and Ms. Zhang Yuzhen, French song by Mr. Zhao Meibo, tai chi chuan and sword dance by Chu Minyi and Mr. Jin Shoufeng. Due to other engagement, Ms. Ma and Yang were unable to come to Liege. The committee telegrammed Yuan Xingjie and Yuan Xingci, two sisters from Paris who were traveling in Beijing, to sing Kunqu opera. Before each performance, Dr. Tian Enpei provided explanations and introductions, adding to the audience's interest. About forty or fifty Chinese students participated in the event, assigned by Chu to serve as temporary hosts or performers, all well-organized and spirited. This fair can be said to be China's first artistic contribution abroad. Although prepared in a short time, the results were very successful and not easy to achieve. I am writing this down to share with my compatriots.</p>
<h3>Appreciating Snuff Bottles (Jun Mei)</h3>
<p>Snuff was once popular a decade or so ago, with nobles and dignitaries all having a bottle in hand, but now it has gradually faded away. Our country's refined scholars are always fond of collecting things, such as paintings, calligraphy, antiques, and other objects. Even if they are incomplete or flawed, they are willing to acquire them at great expense. My cousin, Danlu, enjoys collecting snuff bottles, and over the years he has searched extensively and spent a lot of money, accumulating no less than one hundred different types of bottles. Some are shaped like teapots, some like wine cups, some like today's light bulbs, and some like ancient tripods and vessels. Some are as small as ink boxes, some as large as brush holders, some as flat as silver dollars, and some as long as bamboo tubes. The gourd shape is the most common, followed by the oval shape. Yesterday I went to visit him, and he graciously showed me several types, describing them in detail as if they were his own family treasures. Therefore, I am writing this down.</p>
<p>The jadeite bottle is shaped like a teacup, with a wide mouth and a small bottom, and a handle for carrying. It is carved from jadeite, and the carved flowers and birds are delicate and lifelike. The color is lustrous and flawless, with no nail marks on the bottom. There is a small seal on the bottom with four seal characters, which I could only identify after close examination as "Respectfully Presented by Tong He". My cousin said that this bottle was obtained by my late father from a eunuch when he was touring Beijing as an official. At that time, it was exchanged for one hundred silver dollars. When the Empress Dowager Cixi was in power, she was very fond of snuff, so the princes and dignitaries presented her with extraordinary gifts. The Empress Dowager was particularly fond of this bottle. During the Boxer Rebellion, when she fled in panic, the treasures in the palace were lost and stolen beyond counting. This bottle was also obtained at that time.</p>
<p>The purple stone bottle is shaped like a gourd, with a color like purple clay. The exterior is covered with white and green flowers, which are brilliant and dazzling. The slightly convex parts are decorated with delicate patterns. The bottom is purplish-blue. When illuminated in sunlight, the bottle reveals hidden erotic images of the Tang Palace. My cousin said that this bottle once belonged to Mr. Wei in Shanghai, but was later stolen by his servant and eventually came into my hands. The beauty of this bottle lies in the rarity of its stone. The figures that faintly appear in the bottle are actually painted on the inside. Only a local craftsman in Nanchang, Jiangxi, could do this, and the technique has now almost been lost. Therefore, this bottle is particularly precious.</p>
<h3>A Record of the World's Heaviest Woman, Zoli (Huang Yingdai)</h3>
<p>The arrival of Zoli, the world's heaviest woman, in Shanghai has caused quite a stir. Here are the details based on Western newspaper reports:</p>
<p>Ms. Zoli is an American, and her body weight is measured at 520 pounds, which is approximately 390-odd catties in Chinese weight. She is the heaviest woman in the world. She came to Shanghai last Tuesday aboard the Empress of Canada steamship, with the intention of touring the Far East. It is said that when she returns to her country, she will have to land in Shanghai for a second time. It is reported that Ms. Zoli is not only the heaviest woman in the world, but also that the weight of her entire family of seven is double that of ordinary people, totaling 3,137 pounds, with an average weight of 450 pounds per person. Her brother even weighs 721 pounds.</p>
<p>Ms. Zoli is only twenty-one years old this year. When she was born, she already weighed eighteen pounds. At the age of six, she reached 120 pounds, at twelve, 245 pounds, at eighteen, 457 pounds, and currently, she weighs 520 pounds. Looking at the records over the years, there is still the possibility of further development. Such obesity is truly unique and rare.</p>
<p>Given Zoli's great weight, when she walks, she moves with ease and without any difficulty. She has a good appetite on weekdays, and her health is unprecedented. She is also good at dancing, and she enjoys participating in various recreational activities and gatherings with a competitive nature. Long journeys are often difficult for her, but on this trip, Zoli came up with all sorts of interesting games to amuse herself and her fellow passengers. Her natural intelligence and witty remarks often caused people to burst into laughter. Having such a heavy woman on the journey greatly reduced travel weariness.</p>
<h3>An Examination of Toads (Xiu Jun)</h3>
<p>Toads are smaller than frogs and also belong to the frog family. I read an account of a large toad, weighing five catties, described by the Qing Scholar, which I found astonishing. I suspect the golden-backed toad described in *Youyang Zazu* wasn't this large either. After further research, I found that these creatures can indeed be as large as a plate, a cauldron, or a bed. Weighing five catties is not that large. A description follows:</p>
<p>The *Old Book of Tang, Treatise on the Five Elements*, states: "During the Shenlong era, there was a toad in the Wei River as big as a stone cauldron. The people of the village gathered to watch for several days, and then it disappeared. That year, there was a great flood that swept away hundreds of families in the capital." The *Tang Book, Treatise on the Five Elements*, states: "In the second year of Xiantian, in the sixth month, a large snake, more than ten feet long, emerged from under the bricks of the court hall in the capital. There was also a large toad as big as a plate with eyes as red as fire, fighting each other. Suddenly, the snake entered a large tree, and the toad entered the grass." Furthermore, the *Old Book of Tang, Treatise on the Five Elements*, states: "A month before Li Kui became Chancellor, a large toad as big as a bed was seen in his room and then suddenly disappeared. The diviner interpreted this as the Toad Celestial, indicating an event of good fortune."</p>
<p>In conclusion, from the above, aside from the one entering the grass, one suddenly disappeared, and the other disappeared after several days. Could it be that toads can also transform unpredictably? If so, how can we explain the large toad weighing five catties caught by a villager in a certain village in Loudong?</p>
<p>Based on what we have researched, there is also one extremely strange event that has never happened before: a toad making sounds inside a pillar. A supplementary account follows: In the Ningzhen Temple in Huaizhou, during the Tang Dynasty, the eastern corridor pillar had been there for over fifty years. The Taoist priests often heard the sound of a toad inside the pillar but did not know its exact location. Later, because the pillar was rotten, it was replaced. The cook chopped it up for firewood and found a toad inside the pillar. The pillar had no holes beforehand, according to the *Records of the Five Elements*. How could the toad have entered the pillar without a hole in the corridor pillar? Even if the pillar had been there for fifty years, the Taoist priests heard the toad sound when the pillar was intact as before. If it had not been replaced because the pillar was rotten, or if the cook had not chopped it up for firewood, how would anyone have known there was a toad inside the pillar? This matter is even more extraordinary than the large toad weighing five catties. It shows how vast the universe is, and there is no end to wonders. This is also a matter that cannot be fully understood.</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Trip to the East (4) (Qian Hua)</h3>
<p>Giant Cauldron at Chongfu Temple</p>
<p>The reporter and Mr. Huang disembarked and began their tour. As soon as they left the pier, they were surrounded by dozens of rickshaws, each vying for their attention. They respectfully offered their services, claiming to take responsibility for guiding the tour of the entire city for only one and a half yen per day. Their words were sincere, and there was no sign of the exorbitant demands often made of foreign visitors. Finally, they settled on a price of one yen and twenty sen per rickshaw. Their first destination was Zepfang Park, supposedly Nagasaki's only scenic spot. The road wound up and down, and the rickshaw moved very slowly, as slow as walking. As the saying goes, "walking is as good as riding," but in this case, "riding is as good as walking." After about ten minutes, they arrived at the park gate. The flowers were blooming in profusion, and the ancient trees towered overhead, creating a refreshing atmosphere. The rickshaw pullers led the way, and as they passed each point of interest, they explained and pointed, their words flowing incessantly, which made the experience even more engaging. Zepfang Park is named after Zepfang Mountain and covers a wide area with excellent facilities. There is a public library and a museum, showing the Japanese people's attention to public entertainment venues. At the top of the mountain is a tea room selling various drinks and food, decorated with delicate cleanliness and served by beautiful women, accompanied by the melodious sounds of radio. Sitting in the room, one cannot help but be captivated. Looking down from the window, the entire panorama of Nagasaki is clearly visible. Further ahead from the tea room is the Zepfang Shrine, which is like a Chinese temple. The architecture is also similar. In front of the stone steps of the main hall, the guide, the rickshaw puller, stood upright, clapped his hands, and closed his eyes in silence for about a minute, saying that it was the Japanese way of showing respect to the gods, like kneeling and bowing in our country. Leaving the shrine gate, they descended the steps directly to the park gate and then boarded the rickshaw again to visit the Chinese Chongfu Temple. Chongfu Temple is located on Mount Shousheng, about a li from Zepfang Park. It is a Zen monastery founded by pure Chinese. In recent years, the presiding monk passed away and was replaced by the Japanese. The reporter, due to the limited time, did not have time to investigate its origins, otherwise, it would have been an extremely interesting historical material. The architecture of the temple also imitates the Han style, quite grand. The plaques and couplets are all in Chinese, such as "The Dharma is vast," and so on. Above the main gate, the four characters "Chongfu Zen Temple" are written in bold, with elegant calligraphy, undoubtedly the work of a famous writer. There are no monks in the temple, and it is managed by a certain Japanese person. Upon entering, it was completely silent, but everything was still intact. In the main hall, various Buddha statues are sculpted, but the gold leaf has peeled off, and inches of dirt have accumulated, indicating the desolate state of incense. In the left corner of the hall is a huge iron cauldron, surrounded by a rice fence. The top of the fence is covered with Japanese paper strips, almost entirely, looking like talismans. On the cauldron, it is written in green ink: "The Giant Cauldron for Porridge Donation at Mount Shousheng Chongfu Zen Temple, Made in the Renxu Year, Second Month of the Tianhe Era." According to the rickshaw puller, about three hundred years ago, Nagasaki suffered a great famine, and people in the city ate each other. A certain Elder of Chongfu Temple was greatly compassionate and urgently sent his disciples to use Buddhist Dharma to transport a hundred dan of white rice from China, along with this giant cauldron, to cook porridge in the temple and provide relief, saving the lives of hundreds of villagers, who were grateful for it. The villagers specially preserved this cauldron as a memorial, and it is said that China and Japan have always been like lips and teeth. Speaking of Nagasaki, the relationship is especially close. Although the rickshaw puller's words are mythological, they are not without foundation. The giant cauldron was transported from China, but at that time, there was definitely no such thing. It must have been cast locally, but it is also commendable. It was already four o'clock in the afternoon, and they dared not linger any longer, hurriedly ordering a return.</p>
<h3>Correspondence from the East (10) (1) (Wu Xiaohou)</h3>
<p>(4) Hygienic Testing Laboratory The Hygienic Testing Laboratory is also an important facility in health administration. Currently, it is responsible for specialized investigations and research on various aspects of hygiene in Tokyo City, as well as microscopic, microbiological, medical-chemical, physical, and hygienic examinations, the issuance of certificates for pharmaceutical products, physical examinations, health clinics, preventive vaccinations, and the promotion and dissemination of hygienic knowledge and the preparation of preventive medicines for infectious diseases. According to statistics, the total number of tests conducted throughout the year in Showa 3 was 5,853 for Tokyo City's water quality testing, 2,699 for sewage and other special tests, 6,294 for tests commissioned by various related bureaus and departments of the city, and 11,047 for tests commissioned by other general citizens, totaling 25,893 tests. The main projects undertaken by the laboratory are roughly divided into four categories: (1) hygiene consultation, (2) hygiene education, (3) pharmaceutical preparation, and (4) commissioned testing.</p>
<p>(5) Overview of Commerce, Industry, and Encouragement of Industry in Tokyo City Although Tokyo City is a political district and not an industrial area like Osaka, Yokohama, or Kobe, the development of its production in recent years has made it one of the industrial hubs of Japan. Therefore, an independent Commerce and Industry Section is established directly under the Second Assistant to the Mayor. The prominent commercial and industrial facilities are two:</p>
<p>(1) Commercial and industrial facilities are roughly divided into three types: (1) Encouragement of industry, divided into five categories: (1) Expositions and fairs, with 22 locations, and the city's subsidy amount is more than 84,000 yen. (2) Commercial and industrial consultations, namely commercial and industrial visits, introductions, and mediation activities. (3) Industrial organizations, namely trade associations, with 91 groups and 67,671 members, and 163 quasi-associations with 36,593 members. (4) Industrial surveys, namely surveys of businesses and factories, important industrial products and special products, freight collection and distribution, and ship traffic, as well as the actual situation of small and medium-sized businesses. (5) Industrial friendly gatherings, namely gatherings of the entire city's industrial community for friendly conversations to exchange opinions and refine and improve all facilities. (2) Finance, divided into six categories: (1) Credit unions, (2) financing and repayment methods, (3) construction assistance, (4) financing of working capital for small and medium-sized businesses, (5) payment of subsidies, and (6) surveys of popular finance. (3) Weights and measures control: In Showa 4, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (like our country's Ministry of Industry and Commerce) stipulated a nationwide unified system of weights and measures. The Commerce and Industry Section follows the stipulated laws and regulations to carry out unified control throughout the city.</p>
<p>(2) Market facilities: Tokyo has five municipal vegetable markets: (1) Sanweixian Small Retail Market, (2) Central Wholesale Market, (3) Tsukiji Fish Market, Kanda Produce Market, and (5) Koto Produce Market. In addition, for the sake of meat hygiene and economic relations in the city, a slaughterhouse is also set up. On this day, the reporter visited each market and returned to the Jihua Society. There, he received a letter of introduction from Yunnan Provincial Committee member Zhang Chunou to the Tokyo Municipal Investigation Committee, sent by Huang Jingwan from Shanghai. Also, Jiang Bohan, the supervisor of students studying in Japan, and the Fujianese students Lin Zongxi and Qiu Bizhen and his wife visited one after another and enjoyed chatting. After the visitors left, the barking of dogs and the night wind and rain filled the window, preventing sleep. Dressed, he got up to play dominoes and wrote three poems to send home, saying: "Thousands of mountains and rivers, each in our own corner of the earth. I frequently tell the dominoes, longing with an eager eye. Every day I dream of you, do you dream of me? The wanderer is as thin as a yellow flower under the sea and sky." Also: "Traveling East again, guest poems sent. I count the days of return, not yet fixed. The wind and rain are merciless, adding to my hatred. What is most difficult to dispel is the sorrow of separation." Also: "How many times have I lingered under the green banana window? On the fifteenth of the month, I remember old times." (My wife sent a poem with the line "I still remember the moonlit night last winter.") The sound of dogs barking prevents sleep. I light a lamp and remotely recall the ancient stone heads.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market's Movement Is Erratic</h3>
<p>The changes in the morning and afternoon markets... were in inverse proportion.</p>
<p>Floating and unsteady, as if languid. Yesterday, the attitude toward standard gold was floating and inconsistent. The morning market appeared strong despite weakness, with fluctuations of nine taels. The afternoon market turned from strong to weak, with advances and delays of six taels. The situation was chaotic and unpredictable, ultimately resulting in a decline. The foreign exchange market was starkly different, with the posted rate increasing by half a point. Internally, because the banks' appetite was not bad, they were still able to stand firm. Buying and selling among dealers was very tight, with buyers seeming to be active. Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, Fuchang, and Yongfeng all bought in, while Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Chunyuan Yong, etc., all sold. Since the silver market continued to rise in the morning, it opened very weakly and broke the 590 tael barrier. Afterwards, large players rose up and chased, because the exchange rate gradually strengthened and rose step by step. By now, it had risen by eight or nine taels. It stabilized at noon. Later, Zhifeng Yong, Yongfeng, Jin Da Yongtai, Kangrun, etc., all sold off, while Shunli, Yuankangxiang, and Fuchang bought in. Initially, the atmosphere seemed good because there were many buyers, but the selling pressure increased as the exchange rate rose, and it turned downward, falling five or six taels. Subsequently, it reached slightly above 592 taels. Yesterday, the British silver increased by a quarter, and American silver increased by three-eighths.</p>
<p>First reversed, then upstream. The gold price for August opened with a decrease of three taels, to 590 taels and 8 qian. The gross price once fell to 88 taels, but then rebounded by two or three taels. Buyers were seen to be numerous, and short sellers slightly covered. The banks bought British gold at 6 pence 4375 for September and 3125 for the near term. When the shilling was revealed, it rose to 91 taels and 56 qian, with the posted rate increasing by 125, American gold increasing by 25, and Japanese gold decreasing by 1 fen, resulting in 90 taels and 5 qian. After entering, the banks absorbed the current Japanese gold at 1 tael 3 qian 3 fen. Then, they absorbed 6 pence 275 for the September shilling. Yuan Heng and Yongfeng, etc., competed to purchase, and the market was boosted, gradually rising five or six taels, with lively trading. Around 11 o'clock, it roared to 97 taels. Afterwards, there were swings of two taels. At 11:30, there were slight sales on the table, so it retreated slightly by one tael. The closing price at noon was 95 taels and 4 qian, and the listed price changed to 553 taels and 4 qian. The listed price of Japanese gold decreased by a small 1 fen. Initially, it was suppressed by a small 62 or 3 taels, but at noon, it was suppressed by 57 or 8 taels.</p>
<p>Finally retreated. The afternoon market opened at 97 taels and 3 qian, followed by 7 taels and 7 qian. The goods opened high (reaching 7 and a half taels), and the market was firm. Afterwards, the Indian exchange rate was seen to increase, and the sellers were diligent, gradually declining sharply by four or five taels. However, there were still fluctuations of one or two taels. British gold was also seen to weaken. The near term was traded at 6 pence 1875 and can be closed at 6 pence 3125 for September. By 3:30, it had fallen to 92 taels and 8 qian. It was heard that the Indian exchange rate had increased again, and the popularity suddenly weakened. Then, it returned to slightly above two taels. After 3:30, Tian Fayong and other firms successively competed to sell, and the storm became even tighter, shedding another two taels or more. After 4 o'clock, it was 91 taels and 6 qian. Soon, it rose one tael and then decreased one tael, with mutual fluctuations until the closing at 4:30, at 592 taels and 4 qian, a decrease of one tael and 4 qian compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The final listed price was suppressed by 60 taels and 0. According to the check, the maximum price of the day was 597 taels and 7 qian, and the minimum price was 588 taels, with a difference of 9 taels and 7 qian. The listed price was changed to 553 taels and 4 qian, initially suppressing 62 or 3 taels, and finally suppressing a small 60 taels and 0. The registration was 93 taels for July and 95 taels for August. The water replenishment was 93 taels. The afternoon was 90 taels. The goods opened in the morning at 91 taels and 3 qian, closed at noon at 96 taels, opened in the afternoon at 7 and a half taels, and closed at 92 and a half taels.</p>
<p>Most of the transactions were squared. The supply and demand of each firm varied. Fuchang, Chengfeng Yong, and Hengxing, etc., had divergent entries and exits. Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, Yuanheng, Yu Da, Fuxing Yong, and Jin Da Yong all entered. Dadecheng, Chunyuan Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Fuyu, and Yuancheng Yong, etc., all sold. Zhifeng Yong, Yuancheng, Yongfeng, Taikangrun, Tian Fayong, Chunyuan Yong, and Jin Da Yong sold out in the morning, while Fuchang, Yuankangxiang, Shunli, and retail investors, etc., bought in. The Dalian gang sold 300 to 400 bars in the morning and bought 1,000 bars. In the afternoon, only about 4 million were traded, mostly squared. The Guang gang also broke even, estimated at about 2,000 bars.</p>
<h3>Erratic Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC posted rate for foreign exchange was increased by half a point due to the continued increase in the British and American silver markets. British gold increased by 125 to 1 shilling 6 pence, American gold increased by 25 to 36 and a half yuan, Indian increased by 75 to 100 rupees 75 francs, French increased by 7 yuan to 927 yuan, German exchange increased by 2 yuan to 154 marks, and the Japanese yen increased by half a yuan to 90 and a half shields. Hong Kong decreased by 25 to 85 taels, slope exchange decreased by one tael to 154 and a half taels, and Japanese gold decreased by one fen to 1 tael 3 qian 5 fen 5. However, the bank's internal position was still firm. From a flat start in the morning, the British and American tobacco companies continued to close, and the market strengthened. The bank's appetite was very good, and the situation became tight. The afternoon seemed easy to falter, but the gold market first rose and then fell, ultimately declining slightly, with fluctuations of nearly 10 taels. Chinese speculators sold off 200,000 pounds of British gold, which was taken in by Mitsui, Huabi, Mcali, Yezhu, and Sumitomo East Asia. However, Shanghai Huabi sold off slightly. Also, the trading between banks was not as much as the previous day, only a few tens of thousands of pounds. As for American gold, 100,000 yuan was closed. As for Japanese gold, Dalian gang sold to Erjing Korea for tens of thousands of yuan for near-term Dalian notes. It was heard that the notes were delivered in Dalian and the silver was received in Shanghai. However, dealers were still waiting and watching because the hedging was not satisfactory. As a result, the comparison of each exchange rate showed that the shilling slightly shrank by 0625 and the American gold shrank by 125, which is described as different shades, but only the Japanese gold was slightly suppressed by half a point, no different from a market with transactions but no prices.</p>
<p>The internal plate of the British exchange rate was up and down by 125. In the morning, the price for July was 1 shilling 6 pence 25, August 3125, September 375, and October 4375. The buying price was increased by 0625. The noon close was 6 pence 125 for July, 1875 for August, 25 for September, and 3125 for October. The buying price was 375. In the afternoon, the closing price was 6 pence 1875 for July. The entry price was 25. The forward rate increased by 0625 per month. The price for October was 375. The entry price was 4375.</p>
<p>The internal plate of the American exchange rate fluctuated by 25. Since early morning, the price for July was 37 yuan and the entry price was 7 yuan 125. The price for August was 7 yuan 125, September 25, and October 375. The entry price was 7 yuan and a half. The noon close was 36 yuan 75 for July, 875 for August, 37 yuan for September, and 37 yuan 125 for October. The entry price was increased by 125. In the afternoon, Mitsui sold 50,000 yuan for August at a price of 37 yuan. The closing price was 36 yuan 875 for July and the entry price was 37 yuan. The price for October was 37 yuan 25 and the entry price was 375.</p>
<p>The internal plate of the East exchange rate fluctuated between one fen. The extension period was still 375, and the entry price was suppressed by a small half point. Chinese businessmen were hesitant to take action due to unsuitable hedges. From the early market, the price for July was estimated to be about 1 tael 3 qian 3 fen 5, 3 fen 125 for August, 2 fen 75 for September, and 2 fen and a half for October. Korea initially entered the existing Dalian for a large 10,000 yuan at a price of 1 tael 2 qian 2 fen 375. After 9:30, Mitsui absorbed 100,000 yuan at 1 tael 3 qian 3. Therefore, the gold price broke through 91 taels. Afterwards, trading was light. The noon close was 1 tael 3 qian 4 for July, 3 qian 3 fen 625 for August, 3 fen 375 for September, and 3 fen for October. The closing price was 1 tael 3 qian 3 fen 5 for July, 3 fen 125 for August, 2 fen 75 for September, and 2 fen and a half for October. The entry price was suppressed by half a point.</p>
<h3>British, American, and Indian Silver Markets Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>According to the London telegram, the price of standard silver continued to increase, breaking through the 16 pence barrier. The near term increased by 25 to 16 pence 0625, and the far term also increased by 25 to 16 pence. Chinese buyers were satisfied, and the market was flat. According to the New York telegram, the price of American silver also increased by 375, with the spot price being 34 and a half cents. The British-American exchange rate increased by 03125.

<h3>Stock and Bond Prices Still Fluctuating Greatly</h3>
<p>August futures for disarmament hit the limit down in the morning</p>
<p>Futures for reorganization also fell back 2 yuan 1 jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market and futures market were still buoyant in the morning. In the afternoon, the procedures for the previous market's account were not complete until after 3 o'clock when trading began. Therefore, there was only one market in the afternoon. Only the reorganization saw more activity, while other issues remained clear. As for the trends in each bond price, the turbulence was still huge. When trading opened in the early morning, the purchase transactions were still strong, and the prices continued to rise, continuing the trend of the previous day. Customs futures had continued to rise by more than 2 yuan. Post-war reorganization also rose quite a bit. However, in an instant, the buying interest waned, and the selling increased. August disarmament even fell back to the limit down. It leveled off slightly later.

<h3>The Dilemma of Cotton Yarn Market: A Delicate Balance Between Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>The current sales of cotton yarn are still smooth, and the Cantonese merchants' intention to purchase is quite strong, with high enthusiasm. They are even purchasing at higher prices from various factories, so the market trend is still firm. However, people's minds are still calm, and there is no sign of extreme firmness. This is because the news about the current situation is not good, and other merchants' attitudes are calm, so it is indeed necessary to remain calm. Moreover, various factories still have inventory, so some people are still indifferent. Although the price of Osaka Three Grades yarn has risen, the impact of the exchange rate decline is relatively small. Furthermore, Japanese yarn coming to Shanghai has not been completely cut off, so it is difficult for the yarn market to rise, and it is not easy to rise either.</p>
<p>The distant month's human bid is slightly soft, at 3-4 mace. In the previous market opening, the human bid was firm due to the rise in American cotton, rising by 3.4 mace. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was good demand for spot yarn, and the atmosphere in the market was slightly firm, rising by 1, 2, and 4 mace. The total transaction volume for the day was 5,800 bales. The sellers were Da Ji, Tai Xing, Shen Yu Tong, Chang Feng, Xie Sheng, Tai Sheng, Kang Shen, and Chang Mao Ji, ranging from 200 to 700 bales. The buyers were Gong Tai, Yi Chang, Tian Chang, Yuan De, Da Chang, and Cheng, ranging from 200 to 850 bales. The closing prices of the human bid are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Still Lacks Change</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and the rumors in the market have subsided. The Hubei merchants took advantage of the rise to sell in large quantities, and the Indian cotton merchants were dumping their goods at relatively low prices. Several thousand pieces were traded yesterday and today, and they arrived in Shanghai on the same day. However, the atmosphere in the American cotton market is relatively tight, with signs of a rebound, but the actual sales are too sluggish, and there is no big bullish trend in the market.</p>
<p>Shen Chang was the sole seller of 5,000 dan of Hubei cotton. In the morning opening, the number of sellers in the market increased, so although there were scattered buyers in the near month, the sellers in the distant month poured in. In the second and third sessions, the near month fell sharply, and Heng Da sold the first grade, falling by 5 fen to 1 qian. In the afternoon, Heng Da still sold to close out this month, falling by nearly 1 qian and rising by 5 fen to 1.5 qian in the distant month. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,600 dan. According to statistics, Shen Chang sold 5,000 dan, Heng Da sold 2,000 dan, and Chang Feng and Tong Xing sold 700 to 1,000 dan. The buyers were Rui Da, Da Chang Cheng, Da Ji, Tian Long, Xie Sheng, Yuan Da, and Jin Feng, ranging from 800 dan to 1,500 dan. The closing prices of Hubei cotton are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot sales of Indian cotton are aggressively invading the market. A large amount of Indian cotton is taking the opportunity to come to the market, and the local cotton is being invaded by it. The source of Yao cotton is 100 bales.</p>
<p>White Lo Area 39.00 Da Feng Factory purchased 1,000 pieces and is now loading them onto ships for delivery to the factory.</p>

<p>Shaanxi Cotton 36.75 Shanghai Factory purchased 100 pieces and is delivering the spot goods to the factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton and Three Grades of Japanese Yarn Show Good Signs</h3>
<p>There is a report of drought in American cotton. Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to the drought report, strong Wall Street support, and short covering. The futures rose by 8 to 26 points, and the spot rose by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 8 to 10 points, and the spot rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 25 points. Indian cotton merchants purchased, and traders sold. The Plungar fell by 3 rupees, and the forward month fell by 2 rupees. Aum La fell by 4 rupees in both near and distant months. White Lo Creek fell by 6 rupees, and the forward month fell by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (10th telegram).</p>

<h3>Slight Transactions in the Grain and Rice Market</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were a total of two or three rice boats from various routes. Among them, there was still no japonica rice, and they were all scattered indica rice and other goods. This street has slightly purchased and made some adjustments. Special top-grade goods opened at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, and top-grade Yangjian opened at 20 yuan, 0 jiao, and 5 or 6 jiao. The market transaction was extremely small, and the various goods showed a slightly firm trend. There has been some sampling and negotiation for the japonica rice in the warehouse, but no transaction has been made. The situation may be transferred for sale. Again, there are rumors that some rice shops directly purchase japonica rice in the mainland, according to various sources. It is feared that it will be difficult to verify. I implore Mr. Huang to avoid any contact with rice shops regarding his batch of japonica rice boats.</p>
<p>There was a slight arrival of goods in the river area of South Shanghai, and there were not many transactions in the market. The northern japonica rice is still in short supply, and the indica rice has also become quiet. Only white yuan is slightly transacted. High adjustment yuan is 19 yuan, and Guan Zuo Yin yuan is about 18 yuan and a half. The market situation is stable. The sale of hanging broken rice is mediocre, and the foreign rice market has stabilized. The merchants from the inner roads are temporarily watching, and the transshipment merchants are slightly inquiring. The price is the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Markets Decline in Unison</h3>
<p>Foreign wheat is quoted at 4-5 jiao less.</p>
<p>The current stock of wheat in this port is 60,000-70,000 bags.</p>
<p>The flour market is closed for sales to the north, and many bulls are returning. Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the flour market showed a uniform downward trend. Because the quotation for foreign wheat has decreased by 4-5 jiao, the northern copper market has completely stopped due to the closure. The sales volume of other merchants is not very large. Therefore, although the factories' inventories are not crowded (such as the recent spot goods, they all have to wait for the next shipment, and the current batch is still added by 1 or 2 fen according to the standard), the downward trend is a fact. Therefore, a part of the mainland bulls are returning strongly, and the market is unstable. In the afternoon, the various sectors are trimmed due to the small wheat in the current period, and people's minds are even more depressed. The factories' short sellers still have a few sales, resulting in a drop of 1 fen and 7 li and a half in the near and distant months compared to the morning. The eighth month fell by 2 fen, the September fell by 1 fen and 7 li and a half, the October fell by 1 fen and a half, the November fell by 1 fen and 7 li and a half, and the December fell by 2 fen.</p>
<p>The wheat market continued to weaken due to stagnant factory demand. Yesterday, the wheat market in the morning and afternoon showed a sluggish trend. This situation is due to the excellent weather at the moment, and the early rice harvest in various places is generally expected to be abundant, so most people's minds are inevitably changing. Moreover, flour sales are not smooth, and the factories' demand for wheat is naturally shortened. Major households on the standard side, which belong to the factories' short sellers, are stubbornly holding on, resulting in a general increase in the number of floating sellers, and the market is gradually declining. As a result, the current month is smaller than 5 fen, the eighth month is smaller than 3 fen, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh months are smaller than 2 fen, and the twelfth month is smaller than 4 fen. In the spot wheat market, the factories are still mutually exclusive, and the inventory is already more abundant. It is estimated that the goods stored in Shanghai have reached 60,000-70,000. Although there are trades in Hankou wheat, it is still difficult for merchants to match the factories. Therefore, people's minds are even softer, and the opening prices of various sectors are also smaller by 3 fen or so. A total of more than 5,000 packages of old wheat from Hankou, Bao Ying, Yi Zheng, Pukou, and Xuzhou were opened by various factory offices.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Opens with a Large Volume of 30,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Planned Market Suffers Setback</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received a telegram from the producing area: the spot price of Cuban sugar was 1.3125, an increase of 0.0625 from the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures for September was 1.32, and for February it was 1.40, both increasing by 2 fen. The price for March next year was 1.50, and for May it was 1.57, also increasing by 3 fen each. The spot price of Java sugar was 8.75, the price for August futures was 8.50, and the price for September was 8.375, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous price. The public market auction for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white market was even weaker, with the price reduced to 7 taels and 7 qian and a half. After it was sparsely received, the market price was 7 taels and 7 qian, with a few slight transactions, and the number of sellers decreased, but the buyers were still active, and the market was particularly firm. The medium sand white market also declined, but the transaction was very quiet. Japanese sugar, with the factory plate of Meiji Sugar delivering in August, opened with 10,000 bags, the YT mark price of 6 taels, 4 qian, and 1 fen new standard plus tax. Also, the Minghua Factory opened with 20,000 bags for delivery in July and August, the YRO mark price of 7 taels and 6 qian and a half, the YT mark of 7 taels and 9 qian and a half, and the YP mark price of 8 taels and 1 qian and a half. Although all were sold, the city was not surprised because the planned market for spot sugar suddenly suffered a setback, and the demand was even more scarce. The YRO mark had a slight transaction with a price of 7 taels and 9 qian. The market was generally tired and sluggish.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Common Longan Meat Price Rises by Half a Tael</h3>
<p>The price of common longan meat had previously fallen from 30 taels to 29 taels due to sluggish sales. Recently, the market has gradually become active, but the source has become scarce because the land price is difficult to delineate. According to the investigation, only a dozen or so pieces were shipped in the previous day, and the price has already risen by half a tael compared to the previous price. However, in terms of cost, it is still necessary to lose money, and it is feared that it will be difficult to see an increase in future arrivals.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Are Difficult During Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>European Merchants Offer Surprisingly Low Prices... Chinese Merchants Refuse to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port lacked progress. Green Sea Canteen Silk Weaving Factory and other types have stopped for summer vacation, and the need is even more reduced. The various silk factories in Shanghai also only work half a day in the morning due to the hot summer, and the silk production is also small. Moreover, the European merchants' offers are surprisingly low, and the Chinese merchants' losses are too great, making it even more difficult to sell. Yesterday, Qian Li entered 40 bales of middle body B grade top number 13 to 22 strands, evenness of 82 points, Shanghai factory price of 1,080 taels.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Summer Cocoons Are of Poor Quality</h3>
<p>Thin Skin Is Predominant... Not Suitable for Silk Reeling in Factories</p>
<p>The amount of summer silkworm feeding in Wuxi various cities and villages this year is not weak. Unfortunately, the weather has repeatedly changed, and 80-90% of the silkworm ants have been lost. The cocoon production is limited, and only one cocoon shop is open for weighing. Seeing that the goods arriving in the market were of poor quality, they refused to weigh and collect them. The cocoon body is very thin, not suitable for silk reeling in factories, and can only be sold as raw materials for local silk. Cotton stripping merchants from Hangzhou are now going to Wuxi to collect and handle them. This year, there is almost no market for Wuxi summer cocoons.</p>
<h3>Needle Eyebrows and Fine Eyebrows Sales Continue to Be Smooth in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British merchants, Jinlong, Tongfu, Tianxiang, and Fushi, etc., on the roads of the local village, still had a strong intention to purchase green tea such as needle eyebrows and fine eyebrows. The market was also slightly firmer than before. Zhenmei trading in Wuyuan High Village was not quiet. Xiehe Foreign Firm in Tunxi also made purchases. However, the selling plate has already fallen to within the hundred tael range. It is currently difficult to predict whether the Russian merchants will need Zhenmei in the future. There are already more than 30,000 boxes stockpiled in the market, and the future is very worrying.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Garden Lead Wire Soars</h3>
<p>Garden lead wire has been in great demand recently due to the military needs of the front line. Yesterday, the spot goods in the market were almost completely purchased, and the market price soared as a result. The current price is estimated at 10 taels, 0 qian, and 7 and a half per lot. It is heard that more than 4,000 lots of forward month goods from other roads were also purchased, but the price was only 10 taels and 0 qian and 2 and a half per lot.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance</h3>
<h3>Encouraging Export Goods</h3>
<p>Regardless of Whether They Are Locally Made, Machine-Made, or Imitation</p>
<p>Only Collect Export Tax Once</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs Superintendent Office received an instruction from the Ministry of Finance, which read: "In order to address the issue of the decline in exports due to the preciousness of gold and the cheapness of silver domestically, this Ministry has decided to encourage the export of goods. All merchants who transport and sell overseas products, regardless of whether they are locally made, machine-made, or imitation, shall only pay export tax once at the nearest customs office. After passing through various customs offices, they will only be inspected against the list and will no longer pay tax. Please comply with this instruction and inform your subordinates to comply as well." Furthermore, it is learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has also received the above-mentioned order to instruct its subordinate donation bureaus that they shall not cause difficulties for locally made and imitation goods that have already paid export tax, and should promptly verify and release them to show encouragement.</p>
<h3>Foreign Company Registration</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Announces Measures</p>
<p>The Principle of Reciprocity is Adopted</p>
<p>Since the case of the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. was filed, the problem of foreign companies registering as legal entities was raised by Chinese lawyers, and it was once noticed by the legal and various circles. This matter was decided by the 334th meeting of the National Government, and the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan were ordered to revise and promulgate it. The following is an excerpt from the letter from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Shanghai Merchant Association: "The members of the Shanghai Merchant Association are hereby informed that foreign companies setting up companies in China, whether head offices or branches, shall apply for registration in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations in order to obtain the status of a legal person. However, it has been found that the policies adopted by various countries for the registration of foreign companies are different. Some treat foreign companies the same as companies established by their own citizens, while others adopt the principle of mutual recognition, with the prerequisite that the other country allows companies of their own country to register in their country. Still others, in addition to mutual recognition, set various other restrictions. In view of China's current situation, being too lenient with the registration of companies from various countries would easily lead to abuse, which is not acceptable. However, too strict restrictions would in fact be difficult to implement. It seems appropriate to adopt a compromise approach. It is proposed to adopt the principle of mutual recognition, and the approval or rejection of a company's registration should be conditional on whether the other country allows companies of our country to register in their country. A slight restriction should be added to equal treatment. After detailed discussion by the National Government, it has been decided that the registration of foreign companies should be based on the principle of reciprocity, with the prerequisite that the other country allows companies of our country of the same type to register in their country, except where there are legal restrictions. Accordingly, this letter is recorded and communicated to the merchants of the city to avoid many disputes. Sincerely, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry and Commerce."</p>
<h3>Silver Reserves in This Port Decrease Again</h3>
<p>Imports of Silver Dollars Disappear</p>
<p>According to an investigation yesterday, silver reserves in this port decreased by more than 1.67 million this week, among which the decrease due to the disappearance of Mexican silver dollars was particularly large. The actual decrease was 1,349,000 taels of silver and 450,000 yuan of silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Arrives Smoothly and Vigorously</h3>
<p>Import Prices Have Fallen by 5 Jiao</p>
<p>In recent days, the arrival of foreign indica rice imported from abroad has been very smooth and vigorous. About 200,000-300,000 bags of new goods have arrived, and a large number of orders are about to arrive. At present, the accumulated foreign rice in the market has reached about 700,000-800,000 bags. Therefore, the rice market has fallen from 17 yuan and 7 jiao to 16 yuan and 2 jiao. If the inventory is sold as it arrives and is not hoarded or sold for a better price, the price of rice this month is expected to fall.</p>
<h3>International Radio Station Established Within the Year</h3>
<p>International Communication is of Utmost Importance, and Shortwave Wireless Radio is the Latest Invention and the Only Useful Tool for International Communication. Therefore, European and American countries are currently using it. It is heard that the International Radio Station that China is building in Shanghai will also adopt this new type of radio. Therefore, its scale is unusually grand. According to Engineer Zhu Qiqing of the Shanghai Wireless Radio Administration, this type of radio is divided into three parts: receiving, transmitting, and central remote control. The receiving station is in Liu Xing, the transmitting station is in Zhen Ru, and the central station is in Sassoon's foreign house in Shanghai. There are electric wires connecting the various departments, and all telegrams can be remotely controlled, received, and sent at the central station in Shanghai with the help of a special automatic motor, without having to be sent to Zhen Ru or Liu Xing. Therefore, it is unusually sensitive. At present, the receiving station and the central station's motors have been gradually completed. The construction of the transmitting station is the most extensive and complex. However, it is being actively carried out in recent days. This week, Engineer Zhu personally went to Zhen Ru and saw that the transmitting pole to be used for reporting was about to be completed, towering into the clouds and extremely spectacular. Therefore, it can definitely be completed between September and October this year and will soon be tested with European and American countries. In any case, it can be implemented for reporting within the year. The report on the previous day reported that the reporter of the Guowen News Agency said that the implementation of reporting would be in January and February of next spring. This is a mistake. It is specially noted here.</p>
<h3>Two Percent Donation in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaolin and Others Strive to Cancel It</p>
<p>Fardel is Willing to Submit it to the Meeting Again</p>
<p>The issue of the two-percent additional donation in the French Concession has been a matter of concern since Fardel, the superintendent of municipal affairs of the French Municipal Council, sent a letter inviting Chinese taxpayers in the French Concession to participate in the meeting. After the letter was sent to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, an emergency meeting was convened at 7 pm on the 10th. At the meeting, Cheng Zhusun, Chairman of the Taxpayers Association, Shang Mujiang, and Chen Dezhang, were elected to attend. Yesterday, they went to the French Municipal Council with Chinese Director Zhang Xiaolin to discuss the cancellation of the two-percent additional donation with Superintendent Fardel. They discussed each other for a long time. The representatives firmly insisted that the announcement of the 16th year of the French Municipal Council and the mediator must be taken into consideration. If the two-percent additional donation is not cancelled, the credibility of the municipal council will be greatly affected in the future. Superintendent Fan was very accommodating and agreed to submit it to the Municipal Council for approval, which can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hankou Air Mail Can Be Delivered on the Same Day</h3>

<h3>The Japanese Envoy to China Changes</h3>
<p>However, the Date of Handover Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to transfer ambassadors and ministers to various countries due to changes in its diplomatic policy. The acting minister to China, Shigemitsu, will also be promoted to director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The position of minister to China will be succeeded by Arita Hachiro, the original director of the Asian Bureau. Although the formal appointment has not yet been issued, the matter has been confirmed. The news was telegraphed to Shanghai the night before. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited the office of the Japanese Embassy and met with Deputy Consul General Miura, as Shigemitsu was busy with official duties. According to him, the report in yesterday's newspaper that Shigemitsu would be promoted to director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was indeed true, and the official appointment could arrive in Shanghai within days. It is heard that Shigemitsu has been very successful in his relations with both the government and the people in China since he took office as consul general in Shanghai. He was ordered to concurrently serve as minister and handled various Sino-Japanese negotiations and signed the Sino-Japanese Tariff Treaty, which made him highly respected by people in both China and Japan. He was planning to continue handling Sino-Japanese legal negotiations to complete his work. However, he was suddenly transferred, and he could not help but feel depressed. Therefore, he is still considering whether to take up the new position. People in both China and Japan are also regretting it. As for the new Minister to China, Arita Hachiro, the original director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, graduated from the Department of Law of Tokyo University and passed the diplomatic examination as a senior talent. He has served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a long time and has served as a first-class secretary at the Embassy in the United States, assisting in various important world conferences. He served as a first-class secretary when Ambassador Arasawa was stationed in China, and was later transferred to the post of Consul General in Tianjin. He has been in China for a long time and is familiar with the Chinese political situation. This appointment as the official Minister to China is indeed a very suitable talent. He is currently being transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Ambassador Wang to seek consent, and the date of arrival has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Two Railways Oppose the Newly Promulgated Salary Increase Regulations</h3>
<p>Requesting the Withdrawal of the Order</p>
<p>Also Requesting Rice Subsidies</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Railways promulgated the new salary increase regulations for employees, the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways have found that their current salaries are already insufficient to cover their monthly expenses due to the high cost of living. If the new regulations are implemented, the amount and level of salary increases will be lower than before, which is not a blessing for employees who are in a situation of high gold and expensive silver and high prices for everything. Therefore, they have presented to Director Liu Weichi of the bureau to forward to Minister Sun, requesting the withdrawal of the order and instructing to nominate representatives to meet with Director Liu today to present everything in person. At the same time, they will request rice subsidies. According to the railway employees, the railway and postal services are the same state-owned transportation agencies. The postal service not only continues to increase salaries according to the old regulations, but also temporarily provides each person with a certain amount of rice subsidies every month, which will be cancelled when rice prices and other items return to their original state. Therefore, railway employees should also submit a request to the superior agency for appropriate subsidies to maintain their livelihoods under the same circumstances.</p>
<h3>French Trolleybuses Were Attacked Again Last Night</h3>
<p>A Total of Four Vehicles Were Damaged</p>
<p>At 8:15 pm last night, about a hundred people resembling workers, all hiding stones beside them, entered the French Concession from Nanyang Bridge and headed north along Min Ti Niyin Road. When they arrived at Pi Shao Nai Road, a trolleybus No. 160 on Route 18 was coming from the north. The crowd immediately threw stones at the vehicle, smashing three sides of glass. The crowd then went from Pi Shao Nai Road to Xiao Beimen and turned to the corner of West Xinqiao Street and Ningbo Road, and destroyed three trolleybuses No. 12, 19, and 8 on Route 5. However, vehicle No. 8 was more severely damaged, and the electrical box was completely destroyed. When the police heard the alarm, they ordered detectives to rush to the scene, but the crowd had already dispersed.</p>

<h3>Central Explanation of the Law on the Organization of Industrial and Commercial Associations</h3>
<p>Not Restricted by the Organizational Procedures of People's Organizations</p>
<p>The organization of industrial and commercial associations in this city has always followed the organizational procedures of people's organizations stipulated by the Second Plenary Session, which requires the endorsement of more than 50 initiators with residences in the local area and the permission of the party headquarters before applying for registration. Since the promulgation of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Guilds, Article 3 of which states that the establishment of an industrial and commercial guild requires the initiation of more than seven companies and firms before applying for establishment, the Municipal Social Bureau, in view of the obvious conflict between the two laws and regulations, specifically presented to the Municipal Government and forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for explanation. It is heard that the Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan to separately transfer the matter to the Legislative Yuan and the Central Executive Committee for verification and instruction, as it involved legal and party affairs. Subsequently, the Commercial Law Drafting Committee checked and verified the explanation of the Training Department, stating that the organization of chambers of commerce and industrial and commercial guilds is based on the premise of public guilds and shops as units, and companies and firms as units, which is different from other types of people's organizations that are based on individuals as organizational units. The initiators of the organization can be exempted from the restrictions of the organizational plan of people's organizations and should still be handled in accordance with the regulations of the respective laws. Moreover, in accordance with legislative practice, the application of special laws takes precedence over ordinary laws and can be followed accordingly. The Municipal Government has ordered the Social Bureau to forward the notification to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for separate notification.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Urges Chairman Xu to Take Office</h3>
<p>Various Trade Associations Unite in Criticism</p>
<p>Since being elected, Mr. Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, has repeatedly declined the position. Although all the executive and supervisory committee members visited him to urge him to take office, he has not yet attended the meetings. In order to prevent the suspension of the chamber's affairs, the Executive Committee convened a meeting again yesterday and resolved to have all the executive and supervisory committee members try to persuade him to take office. However, the standing committee members, considering that the chairman has not yet taken office and it is not appropriate to act as chairman for a long time, decided to resign en masse. Now, various trade associations, considering that this port is a place of international attention and that it has fallen into a state of suspension shortly after its establishment, which has a significant impact on the interests of various industries and the commerce of this city, have sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council, criticizing it. It is reported that all the executive and supervisory committee members of the council have been visiting Chairman Xu in recent days to urge him to take office immediately. Furthermore, the various trade associations, concerned about their own interests, will also send representatives to urge him. If he still does not take office, it is said that further measures will be taken.</p>

<h3>Sale of the Telephone Company</h3>
<p>The Company Authorities Decide to Hand Over at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that although the National Government and civic groups have repeatedly opposed the sale of the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company to the International Telephone Company, the Board of Directors of the company is determined and the majority of shareholders have expressed their approval. It has been decided to implement the transfer in accordance with the passed resolution, and there is no hope of reversing it. Subtleties of details are being consulted these days and the implementation must occur at the latest at the end of this month. Most noteworthy is that according to the announcement of the company's shareholders' meeting yesterday, Chinese shareholders who supported the sale accounted for the majority when the special meeting discussed the tender offer last time. The detailed numbers of the Chinese and foreign shareholders voting are supplemented as follows: (1) In favor: 9.975 foreign shareholders, 3.402 Chinese shareholders; (2) Against: 387 foreign shareholders, 948 Chinese shareholders. Statistics show that foreign shares account for 53% of the votes in favor and Chinese shares account for 47%. However, statistics based on the total number of Chinese shareholders show that as many as six out of ten are in favor of selling to the International Company.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce States the Evils of Parcel Post Tax</h3>
<p>A Telegram Is Sent Requesting Submission to the Tax Reduction Committee for Abolition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, saying: "We have checked the file and received a joint announcement from the Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Staff Union stating that the parcel post tax is something that did not exist in the past. During the era of warlord separatism, some provinces used the excuse that parcel post did not pay the likin tax and created this type of tax in order to collect money and expand their military. However, there was no complete organization. After our National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Ministry of Finance followed the old examples and reorganized and expanded it, establishing special offices to supervise the matter. General bureaus were set up in each province, and branch offices were established in counties and cities. The system of parcel post tax was thus established. However, since its establishment, more than two years have passed, and the resulting malpractices have been unbearable. We would like to briefly state them for your review: Parcel post parcels sent to commercial ports must pass through customs for inspection and payment of regular taxes and sundry taxes such as child tariff, wharf, and Qingpu taxes, which are already quite substantial. Then, the Parcel Post Tax Bureau adds a 2.5% tax, and when the parcel arrives in the interior, the local Parcel Post Tax Bureau levies another 2.5% tax. In this way, one item is taxed multiple times, and each tax is levied. The suffering of the merchants is self-evident. The inconvenience of the cumbersome procedures of repeated inspections by customs and tax bureaus when sending parcels is another matter. According to an article in the May issue of the British Chamber of Commerce Magazine, we would like to translate it to provide proof. The original text says: 'Finance Minister Song said that the parcel post tax is not a new tax, but a type of likin tax. However, the likin tax does not apply to parcels coming from abroad, nor does it apply to parcels going to Chinese commercial ports, nor does it apply to parcels going to the interior and passing through a commercial port. Now, all are taxed. The only parcels not taxed are those sent from abroad to China. Furthermore, this parcel post tax does not follow the customs valuation method, so it is always higher than the customs tax rate. The likin tax only collects its due, while the parcel post tax collects both the origin and destination. For example, if there is silk weighing one hundred pounds sent from Shanghai to Beijing, the tax payment comparison is as follows: (1) Sent by parcel post: postage 6.6 yuan, customs tax 41.4 yuan, parcel post tax 9 yuan, totaling 57 yuan; (2) Sent by railway passenger car: freight 3.94 yuan, likin tax 17 yuan, totaling 20.94 yuan; (3) Sent by railway freight car: freight 0.22 yuan, likin tax 17 yuan, totaling 17.32 yuan. If such a bad method is not abolished, the fastest and most reliable postal transportation in the country will disappear from now on.' Currently, many parcels are abandoned by the post office and sent through other channels because other transportation agencies charge much lower taxes for carrying the same type of goods via the same route, and the procedures are also simpler. As a result, the number of parcels received by the post office has gradually decreased. Taking Shanghai as an example, before the establishment of the Parcel Post Tax Bureau, the number of parcels received by the post office increased year by year. After the establishment of the bureau, the result was the opposite. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the post office received 1,013,240 parcels, while in March, April, and May of this year, it only received 192,079 parcels. Parcel post has always been the main source of income for the post office, but the obstruction of the parcel post tax has caused the economy to be cut in half and expenses are not covered. The post office is a profit-making enterprise for the country, and the Parcel Post Tax Bureau is a tax revenue agency for the country. They are both under the jurisdiction of the government, so why should they be divided? It is only because it is beneficial to finance that they forget the harm to transportation. It is like cutting flesh to mend a sore on the arm. It is a mistake of the wise. From this, it can be seen that the parcel post tax is indeed harmful to merchants and people and severely burdens the post office. It was originally intended to compensate for the likin tax, but it is nothing more than a disguised form of likin tax. The central government has already declared that it will abolish the likin tax from October 10th of this year, and the Ministry of Finance also plans to convene a meeting on the abolition of the likin tax on the 10th of this month. Therefore, this disguised form of likin tax, the parcel post tax, should be abolished uniformly in order to completely abolish the bad tax system and abolish redundant agencies at the same time. The matter concerns both tax and postal administration and cannot be ignored. We must unanimously urge the government department to include the parcel post tax in the agenda of the tax reduction meeting and resolve to abolish it in order to alleviate the post office's difficulties and alleviate the merchants' suffering." The chamber considered this matter a commercial hardship and sent letters to relevant industry groups to solicit opinions on the abolition of the parcel post tax, detailing the meetings and forwarding the cases. According to a reply from the Shanghai Silk Industry Group Consolidation Committee, the case was submitted to the fourth Consolidation Committee for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that this parcel post tax is indeed a kind of disguised likin tax that harms merchants and people, and the silk industry suffers the most. The telegrams from the Postal Workers' Union have already explained it in detail. The former Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Silk Industry Branch, the China National Silk Shanghai Relief Association, and the Silk, Cigarette, Match, and Soap Industry Federation have all previously submitted cases to the government authorities requesting abolition. Now that the Ministry of Finance's tax reduction meeting has opened, your chamber should submit it to the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan, ordering the tax reduction committee to include this parcel post onerous tax on the agenda and resolve to abolish it in order to alleviate the suffering of the silk industry. In view of this, the chamber believes that the parcel post tax is a disguised likin tax that has been publicly recognized by all sectors. Since its establishment and collection, there have been many malpractices and it has been criticized by all merchants. According to the British Chamber of Commerce Magazine, for example, the cost of transporting silk weighing one hundred pounds from Shanghai to Beijing by post is more than twice as high as by road. The disadvantages have long been understood by your Excellency. Moreover, since the parcel post tax became popular, the post office's parcel income has sharply decreased. Both are national tax revenue agencies, but this surplus and that deficit have little increase in tax revenue. At this time when tax reduction is about to be implemented, the Postal Workers' Union and the Silk Industry Group's application for the abolition of the proposal is indeed the only requirement to improve the tax law and eliminate commercial difficulties. In view of the above-mentioned circumstances, we should telegraph your ministry to review and approve the proposal to resolutely abolish it in order to avoid onerous taxes and demonstrate the restoration of prosperity. This is a public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>Cultivating Talents for International Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>Chen Tianjun, Section Chief of the Naval Department's Political Affairs Division, previously believed that in order to develop China's nascent shipping industry, it was necessary to train maritime talents as a prerequisite, and that practical training was an important subject for maritime studies. Since China has no ships operating on international routes, it is not easy to visit foreign countries. Therefore, last year, after taking office, Section Chief Chen sent letters to various foreign shipping companies requesting them to arrange for Chinese trainees on their ships. The British Company and the Likmao Company replied and agreed. Section Chief Chen has repeatedly contacted the Shanghai Shipping Association, Wusong Merchant Marine School, Fisheries School, and various groups to guarantee the trainees and send them to serve on ships. The fees are low and the results are effective, and the shipping companies are deeply in favor of it. Recently, Section Chief Chen received a letter from the German Henburg Company agreeing to send trainees on board for practical training and has sent letters to various groups related to the shipping industry to send trainees again.</p>
<h3>New Information on Pacific Shipping</h3>
<p>China and the United States Add New Ships: Within the Sino-American Pacific route this year, Britain, the United States, Japan, and Norway have all increased the number of new ships, competing with full spirit on speed. Generally, the horsepower of the new ships must travel at least 17 nautical miles per hour, and the battle between the mail ships is even fiercer, with some increasing to 19 knots and some increasing to 20 knots. The fast ship fever of the Atlantic shipping world has become prevalent on the Pacific route. The British Smith Shipping Company has never had Sino-American liners. This time, it has specially dispatched more than ten new-style cargo ships of 10,000 tons to Shanghai to open up a new Sino-American route. The route is from Shanghai to Houston in the United States and via Japan. Houston is a concentration point for silk going to the United States and an important port for the export of American cotton. Ships such as Seattle City, Wengu City, Victoria City, and Atlantic City have been dispatched to Shanghai. In the Far East, Xiangtai Foreign Firm has been entrusted with the management. From now on, there will be another British shipping company on the Sino-American route, together with the original Japanese, American, Norwegian, and British shipping companies, making a total of 19 companies operating. The total number of ships has exceeded 200.</p>
<p>The Price of Lake Silk Shipping Is Negotiated To Increase: After the recent silver drop and gold rise, the shipping prices of all routes have increased. Only the Lake Silk freight on the Sino-American route has not been able to increase since the price was reduced due to the disturbance of the Japanese shipping companies. This is because most of the shipping companies have contracts with the customers. However, the price from Shanghai to Hoboken, which was originally US$4 per 100 pounds, has now increased to US$4.20. The shipping companies also plan to slightly increase the freight from Shanghai to San Francisco and other places, which is US$1 per 100 pounds, otherwise the losses will be too great, and the meager US$1 is not enough to cover the cost of the wharf. It is currently being negotiated with the various companies.</p>
<p>Rikuju Maru Is Also Completed: The second new ship built by Nippon Yusen Kaisha on the Seattle route, the Rikuju Maru, is a sister ship to the Hikawamaru, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Both are fast ships of 11,000 tons. It has also been completed and is being equipped with passenger seats, scheduled to start the first voyage on August 23.</p>

They arrived in Shanghai last night and landed at the Huangpu Wharf. Captain Johnson also came with them. Kailuan is now first inquiring about the truth of the accident and then planning the salvage and arbitration.</p>

It is also heard that Director Wu will personally come to the scene to supervise the work at that time to show his solemnity. It is estimated that the work can be completed and the call can be made in one week.</p>
<h3>Two Leather Factories in Zhabei Call for Protection</h3>
<p>The Tongliyuan and Chengfa leather factories on Zhangqiao Road in Zhabei sent a letter to the Guangzhou-Zhao Guild Hall, the Overseas Chinese Federation, and the Yueqiao Federation, saying: "Dear Sirs, we are writing to you. Our factories are located on Zhangqiao Road in Zhabei. The two factories are connected, but because the location is remote and extremely desolate, there has never been a guard post set up in the nearby miles to protect it, and there are no police patrols because it is far from the city. As a result, local hooligans and bandits often dismantle and steal from our factories. For example, on the night of May 1 and June 24 of this year, the fence of our Chengfa Leather Factory was pried open by these people, and they broke into the factory and stole a total of 13 pieces of cooked Hu green buffalo hide in two times. It has been reported to the third branch of the fifth district for investigation, and the stolen goods have not been recovered. The representative of the Lingnan Tongqun Litiyu Association also presented a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to strictly arrest the perpetrators. However, the ink was not dry and the case has not been closed. On June 28, at 6 pm, two bandits dismantled the Tongliyuan Leather Factory and tried to steal the buffalo hide. Manager Dai Ying came out to negotiate and was beaten. They then gathered hundreds of bandits to the Tongliyuan Leather Factory, smashed the door, and swarmed in, beating anyone they saw and destroying the leather-making equipment in the factory and robbing property. More than ten innocent factory workers were beaten. Such rampant behavior is truly fearless of the law. If no measures are taken to protect them, the consequences will be unbearable. Although the Public Security Bureau captured a few perpetrators at the time, there are still many fugitives who should be strictly arrested and brought to justice in order to curb the banditry. Our colleagues have been engaged in the buffalo hide business in Nanyang. Due to the bullying of foreigners, we have returned to China together to revitalize the industry and open leather factories to do our best to love the country. However, we have paid the merchants' obligations such as police fees and room donations. If the protection is not thorough, where can we enjoy the right to local peace? Therefore, our factories often suffer from hooligans and bandits dismantling and stealing. The pain of being beaten by these people on the afternoon of June 28 is that we want to close down the business, but the previous efforts are in vain and the capital is gone. If we continue to do business and the local hooligans and bandits destroy it, if we do not plan for a good aftermath, the suffering in the future will be worse than today. We are forced to ask your guild hall to ask the municipal government to transfer the municipal public security bureau to set up a real guard post near our factory and send more police patrols to protect it. Please send a letter to the local court to handle the case impartially and severely punish the criminals and hooligans involved in the case, and strictly arrest the remaining accomplices so that the bandits cannot escape justice and our factories can be at peace. Thank you. The Tongliyuan Leather Factory and Chengfa Leather Factory in Zhabei, Shanghai, sincerely submit."</p>

<h3>Former Fudan Queen Zhang Aila</h3>
<h3>Sues Editor of "Chinese Students"</h3>
<p>Listed alongside Huang Baiying... Said to have entered the dance halls.</p>
<p>Zhang Aila believes she has suffered a major insult.</p>
<p>Zhao Jiabi is willing to reconcile... Negotiating out of court.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Pinlan's alias "Aila," the meaning of which is unknown, acquired the title of "Queen" while studying at Fudan University because of her excellent writing and unparalleled beauty. Later, after Miss Zhang left Fudan and joined the Jianghai Customs Service, the "Chinese Students" magazine, Volume 2, Issue 2, No. 14, published by Liangyou Publishing House on North Sichuan Road, contained an article by Wang Yuanxing entitled "An Analysis of the Incident of Female University Students Entering Dance Halls," which stated that Miss Zhang Aila and Miss Huang Baiying, who recently made headlines throughout the city for being forced to take poison, had entered Shanghai dance halls as dancers, and included Zhang's portrait in the article, placing it alongside Huang Baiying's photo. Zhang believes that the magazine's editor, Zhao Jiabi, intentionally insulted her by publishing this entirely untrue text, which also concerned her personal reputation. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Zhao. Yesterday morning, Judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Special District Court presided over the hearing in the Fifth Tribunal and summoned the defendant Zhao Jiabi, who also hired lawyer Qian Baohe. The plaintiff's lawyer first presented the magazine as evidence and had Zhang Pinlan describe the untruths in the article and the damage to her reputation. She stated that the photo of her published in the magazine was one she had previously lost. Her minimum demand of the defendant was that the magazine publish an apology with the same prominence as the insulting text. In addition, apologies must also be published in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers in conspicuous places, and the defendant must also formally send a letter expressing his apology. The defendant Zhao Jiabi agreed to most of the plaintiff's demands, but was initially unwilling to publish apologies in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao because the cost was too great and beyond the financial capacity of the defendant's company. However, Judge Cheng advised him not to haggle further and hinder the reconciliation. Zhao then obeyed the court's order, but stated that publishing in the two newspapers could not be forced and must be a certain position. Judge Cheng then adjourned the case to the following Thursday, instructing both parties to negotiate a settlement out of court. If a settlement is not reached by the deadline or if a settlement is reached but then reneged, the case will be summoned for hearing again.</p>
<h3>Tragic Incident of Driving with Prostitutes</h3>
<h3>The Chauffeur is Blameworthy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, he was prosecuted in court by the police.</p>
<p>The driving speed exceeded the normal limit.</p>
<p>Prostitutes and their patrons rode in a car to enjoy the moonlit night in the suburbs, and a car accident occurred in Beixinjing. Three prostitutes died, and one or two were injured. The patrons and the chauffeur were also injured. The details of the incident have been reported in this newspaper. The Jing'an Temple police investigated the incident and determined that the disaster was caused by the chauffeur, Wang Chunfu. Although Wang was also injured, he could not escape the blame for negligence. Yesterday morning, when Wang's injuries had slightly decreased, he was brought to the Special District Court and prosecuted under Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for interrogation. According to the police lawyer Li Zhishan, the police investigated the scene of the accident and found two sets of tire tracks: one was the track of the wheels when driving, and the other was the track of the wheels when stopping. The two places were 85 feet apart, which showed that the speed of the defendant's car at that time was actually above 35 yards. The Xujing police then reported the investigation process. According to the defendant Wang Chunfu's testimony, he was a chauffeur at the Lanji Auto Company at No. 126 Zhengjia Wood Bridge. That night, the Tiannan Hotel on Changbang Road called to rent a car. At about 11 p.m., I drove car No. 12577 to the front of the hotel. Two men and three women boarded the car and ordered me to drive to Beixinjing for a drive. When passing Chenjia Bridge on Hongqiao Road, my car was traveling east to west when I suddenly saw two cars in front of me traveling east to west at a very high speed. Moreover, the two cars were driving side by side, each with its high beams on, almost as if they were racing. Suddenly, my eyes were dazzled and I could not see clearly. I quickly turned the wheel to avoid them, causing the car to crash into a tree. The five men and women in the car and I were all injured. At that time, my car was not very fast, only about 30 yards, and so on. He also hired a lawyer to defend him and requested permission for Wang Chunfu to be released on bail for medical treatment. Judge Wu ruled that the case involved casualties and that bail should be difficult to approve and ordered the defendant to be held for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhongshan Road</h3>
<h3>Bridge Project Completed</h3>
<p>Vehicles and other traffic can pass without hindrance.</p>
<p>The Zhongshan Road, newly built from Zhenru to Longhua in western Shanghai, had its entire road surface completed last winter. However, because the bridges over the small rivers in the middle and the Dayang Bridge over the Suzhou River had not yet been built, it was still not possible to pass through. It is now learned that the small bridges on the entire road have been completed successively this year. The Dayang Bridge over the Suzhou River west of Fanhangdu has been under construction since last winter for more than half a year and has now been fully completed. Vehicles and other traffic can now pass, so the entire Zhongshan Road is open, which is very convenient.</p>
<h3>French Concession Health Department</h3>
<h3>Preventing the Outbreak of Epidemics</h3>
<p>Implementing free vaccination for prevention.</p>
<p>The Health Department of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, in view of the hot weather since the beginning of summer and the ease with which epidemics can spread, has launched free vaccinations to prevent the outbreak of cholera and to protect the safety of residents within the concession. Two clinics have been established, one inside the Grand Self-Sounding Bell Police Station and one at the Xujiahui Road Health Center. In recent days, the Health Department ambulance has been stationed at various intersections, and doctors have been administering free vaccinations.</p>
<h3>Lu Genrong's Reply</h3>
<p>After the prosecutor appealed the case in which Lu Genrong in the Huang-Lu case was declared innocent, Lu's defense lawyer submitted the following reply:</p>
<p>Criminal Reply (Respondent: Lu Genrong) Defense Lawyer: Song Mingxun Regarding the case in which the respondent was sued for theft, and the plaintiff official disagreed with the judgment made by the Second Retrial of the Jiangsu Higher Court, an appeal was filed. A reply is hereby submitted in accordance with the law, as follows:</p>
<p>Upon review of the original case, the first section of the plaintiff official's appeal stated, "Although a comprehensive review of the entire file cannot prove how the defendant Lu Genrong assisted Huang Huiru at the time of the theft, it is difficult to dismiss his responsibility for transporting the stolen goods," etc. The problem of the innocent verdict of the alleged theft part of the original trial is no longer within the scope of the appeal. As for the point of disagreement, it only concerns whether or not the stolen goods were transported. The appeal arguments are hereby defended. It is necessary to base criminal proof of facts on evidence. If the evidence is insufficient, or there is no conclusive proof of the crime, the defendant should be acquitted based on the suspicion of a crime that cannot be proven. This is the principle of criminal procedure law. In this case, whether the respondent has a suspicion of transporting stolen goods or not, the gist of the Second Retrial of the Final Court was that if the respondent transported the goods stolen by Huang Huiru to the Quxingtai Woodshop after Huang Huiru's theft, he could not be exempted from criminal responsibility, etc. The point to be noted in the instructions is whether the respondent ever deposited the items in the Quxingtai Woodshop. It is now found that this one thing has been clearly and definitely determined by the original trial, and the allegations of the complainant Huang Zhu are false and cannot be believed. Then, the respondent is naturally not responsible for any crime under the criminal law regarding suspicion of transporting stolen goods. According to the plaintiff official's appeal arguments, they are divided into two points: (1) Point A: The only thing the plaintiff official considered relevant here is the extraction of Huang Huiru's statement in the first instance: "The things were taken out on the afternoon of the twelfth. Lu Genrong came out on the twelfth." All the other statements by Huiru in the entire file stating that things were taken out by me on the thirteenth are all ignored. In this regard, the Final Court also recognized it as a suspect in the respondent's crime, but in fact, it is still necessary to seek further confirmation. The judgment in the Second Retrial had already been instructed clearly. Now, the original trial investigation shows that there is absolutely no other confirmed business in the facts, and the second point in the reasoning column of the original verdict has been explained in detail in the case, so it is naturally not allowed to be involved in further inferences. Furthermore, the plaintiff official said, "Huang Huiru's statements have been for the defendant's explanation everywhere," and again cited the car as a proportion. The car's hiring is part of the relationship between harmony and temptation, and is not within the scope of the theft part. I will not list the discussion for now. If it is said whether Huiru's statements are for the respondent to absolve, unless you ask Huiru, it is impossible to prove it. Others are never allowed to freely presume. As for the fact that Huang Zhu beat Huiru on the twelfth, according to Huiru's statement in the file, it is true that Huang Zhu beat her on the twelfth night, but she absolutely denied the phrase "Lu Genrong took it out." Moreover, there is a phrase in her statement, "The things were placed in the downstairs study on the twelfth night." The plaintiff official used Huiru's beating as a presumption to prove that the things had been taken out on the twelfth. How can one have not yet consulted the details of Huang Huiru's statements in the entire file? This statement is inevitably close to conjecture. Secondly, it is based on the statements of the Public Security Bureau. The statements of the Public Security Bureau were not in a question-and-answer format at the time, but were compiled after the fact. Just looking at the four words "carried valuable" in the record, it is definitely not the text that should be in the oral statement. Moreover, the description is based on the phenomena after the case was solved. It is not possible to associate the respondent with suspicion based on this. Moreover, the interrogation of the bureau is not an investigation in the direct trial of the court, and cannot be used as a basis for a decision. The former Dali Temple has a precedent. Therefore, although the intent of the Final Court also recognized this section as a criminal suspicion, it still needs to seek further confirmation in the facts, and it was also explained in detail in the judgment of the Second Retrial. However, the plaintiff official still cited it as proof of transporting stolen goods, which is really out of the realm of reason. This point A cannot be established. (2) Point B: This point is divided into three paragraphs. The first paragraph said that the crime was only a means, and the purpose was to seek wealth. This paragraph traces Huang Huiru's theft to the cause and effect of the crime before adultery. It is impossible to link them together and is not an issue that should be discussed legally in this theft case. There is no value in replying. Second paragraph: This paragraph is the most complex in the plaintiff's argument and is refuted point by point as follows: (Zi) It is said that Huiru and the respondent agreed to escape. The day before, they handed the leather box to Lu to secretly transport out, and they cannot deny that they had no plans, etc. According to this section of the tone, it is no different from the plaintiff official having already determined that Huiru did hand over the things to the respondent and took them away on the twelfth, but it is found that Huang Huiru and the respondent both stated in their statements that the things were taken out by Huiru herself on the thirteenth, and the statements of the two are consistent with each other, which has been described in detail in the first point of the reasoning column of the original verdict, and the plaintiff official completely ignored it and made a judgment. He also attached the words "plans", but he did not know what to base it on. (Chou) It also said that referring to the fact that the things were transported out first on the twelfth and a car was hired to pick up people on the thirteenth, it is undeniable that they were colluding with each other. The car hiring problem is not within the scope of theft and has been explained above. The plaintiff official used this to pull in as collusion in the theft, which seems to be out of the question. (Yin) And said that the defendant stated in the Public Security Bureau that he carried valuable ornaments, etc., not only knew that there were ornaments hidden in the box, but also knew that their value was valuable, etc. The statements narrated by the Public Security Bureau were compiled after the fact and are insufficient to be taken as evidence, as has been explained above. In the end, it is impossible to prove whether the respondent knew that there were valuable ornaments hidden in the box before the Public Security Bureau solved the case. The plaintiff official based his word on this presumption, which is inevitably too ideal. (Mao) It is further said that the defendant served as a teahouse in Huang Zhu's for a long time and knew the family affairs deeply. Huang Zhu was in charge. Suddenly, when they agreed to escape, he handed over the valuable ornaments to him to transport out first, and the details of his escape were obvious. He must not say that he had no foresight. According to this statement, it is even more bizarre. The respondent served as a teahouse and was in charge of external affairs. How did he know how much family wealth Huang Zhu had? The plaintiff official said that the respondent could foresee it when he served as a teahouse. I don't know where he imagined it from.</p>
<p>The third paragraph said that Huiru and the respondent moved back and forth between Suzhou and Shanghai, changing their residences several times, and also pawned the ornaments and ate together. How could they not know the origin of these ornaments? It was found that the things Huiru sold were sold by herself and had nothing to do with the respondent. As for the eating problem after running away, it is not related to theft. The plaintiff official even attributed the eating to the respondent and must know the origin of the ornaments. This statement is not only conjecture, but also inevitably bordering on arbitrariness. Looking at the above points B and C, they first said plans, then said collusion, then said foresight, and finally said how could they not know the origin. It is nothing more than all kinds of speculation. The language in the intention of the Final Court to send the same and retrial to seek other confirmation is just the opposite. This point B cannot be established either. In summary, the ornaments in this case were taken away by Huang Huiru herself on the thirteenth and were not handed over to the respondent for transportation. Huang Huiru has stated this clearly in her statements, and also told him (referring to Lu Genrong) that he only knew that he was wearing ordinary clothes and did not know that there were jewelry, etc. It is credible and unambiguous that the respondent not only suspected of transporting Huang Huiru's theft, but also did not know the facts. The original trial recognized that it was obvious and could not prove the crime, and the judgment of innocence was extremely appropriate. The plaintiff's official's appeal is difficult to say that it is reasonable. Based on the above arguments, I respectfully request the court to review and request to invoke Article 408 of the Criminal Procedure Law to make a judgment rejecting the plaintiff's official's appeal. Respectfully, to the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>News of the French Democratic Memorial Games</h3>
<p>In previous years, fireworks were often set off for the French Democratic Memorial, but the results were poor due to rain, and it was not easy to get new and strange products in Shanghai for a while, so this year, they will not be set off again. Other various games will still be held as usual.</p>
<h3>New Owner of Dahua Hotel</h3>

The new owner, the British Business Guang Company, is mainly engaged in real estate, and the hotel business is not its concern.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Plague Hospital opened yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society Tianjin Road Plague Hospital officially opened yesterday. The opening ceremony was held at 3:00 p.m. There were more than 80 people from the military, political, business, and academic circles, as well as the president Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Wen Lanting, and Wang Peiyuan. Dr. Wang Peiyuan, the president of the hospital, led Chinese and Western guests to visit the various departments of the hospital. The Western guests included Miss Nie Guosi, head nurse of Renji Hospital, Miss Du Tao Baiers, Mr. Sheris, health official of the French Public Works Bureau, Mr. Labai, director of the Health Department, Mr. Tan Chen, president of the Public Concession Fire Brigade, and Mr. Yanalai, dean of the Aurora Medical College. They all praised the hospital's precision and practicality in treating plague instruments. The Western guests criticized the treatment of the plague for being valuable in experience rather than specializing in drugs and equipment. The doctors and nurses of the hospital are all veterans who were the first to treat the plague and hold important positions in medical affairs, so their results in saving lives can occupy an advantage. Later, Wang Xiaolai, a member of the executive committee of the association, generously donated 200 yuan to the hospital's expenses.</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<h3>Initiation of a Temporary Plague Hospital</h3>
<p>The area north of Zhabei Station is vast and densely populated, especially with many civilians. They suffer from epidemics and have no suitable local hospitals. Sending them to distant places takes time and often leads to no rescue. Therefore, local party members and businessmen believe that the establishment of a temporary plague hospital is an urgent task. Yesterday, more than 50 people, including party members Jiang Jizi, Li Henglin, Li Youtang (Western medicine), businessmen Lin Jianyuan, Shi Rentai, Wang Chengdong, Ye Qichang, and Chinese medicine Yu Zhende, initiated the organization of preparations to discuss the implementation of the method. There are many clues, and it will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Abolish Bad Funeral Customs in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Joint Proclamation by the Social and Public Security Bureaus</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau and the Public Security Bureau jointly issued a proclamation stating that it has been found that in the rural areas of Gaohang, etc. in this city, whenever a family encounters a funeral, residents nearby, old and young, carry paper money and flock to the funeral home for meals on the occasion of the fifth and seventh days. Even from a distance of four or five miles, they come in groups. Each time, there are as many as three or four hundred seats, and at least eighty or ninety seats. There are many people and mixed voices, and the order is chaotic. The owner is exhausted to cope, and the cook is exhausted to run around. The rich families feel pain in their spirits and bodies, and the poor borrow money and pawn everything, even selling fields and selling property. This kind of bad habit is not commensurate with ability, does not care about people's difficulties, and does not care about people's livelihood, which damages the society more than this. In addition to the Public Security Bureau ordering its subordinates to investigate and ban them at any time, it will also order the municipal commissioners of various rural areas to find ways to guide them to abolish them automatically. In addition, it is specially issued to the citizens of various rural areas, reminding them that material resources are difficult, and funeral etiquette should be called the family's existence or absence. It is natural for neighbors to condole, but they must measure the financial resources of the mourning family. How can they go in groups like beggars? After the proclamation, the citizens of various rural areas should change it if they have it, and encourage them if they don't, in order to frugality and promote thrift. If they still deliberately violate it, they will be severely punished and not pardoned once they are found out. This is specially announced.</p>
<h3>Hot Weather</h3>
<h3>Each Silk Factory Only Works Half-Time</h3>
<p>Every year when the hot summer arrives, the silk factories in this city have the practice of temporarily suspending the summer vacation. Recently, the silk market in foreign villages has been sluggish, and the humid heat has invaded people. In the past few days, the temperature in the workshop after noon has often been above 100 degrees Celsius. All the silk reeling female workers are sweating like rain, so they are specially following the example of holding a summer vacation, only working half-time in the morning and stopping work in the afternoon. The full-day work will be resumed after the weather is slightly cooler.</p>

<h3>City Public Works Bureau Bans Dog Racing Ads</h3>
<p>The City Public Works Bureau, considering dog racing to be a form of gambling, has strictly prohibited the posting of dog racing advertisements to prevent them from poisoning society and causing endless harm. It previously sent a letter to the French Tramway and Electric Light Company instructing them to remove dog racing advertisements posted on French trams. The company replied that the advertisements were only posted on trams within the French Concession and that they had notified the British company not to display them on trams operating in the Chinese area. However, it has recently been found that French Route 6 trams are again carrying dog racing advertisements in the Chinese area, which is considered a violation of the ban. Therefore, another letter has been sent to the French company requesting that they remove the advertisements immediately to uphold the law.</p>

<h3>A Husband's Immorality Leads to Divorce Through Mediation by Both Families</h3>
<p>Xu Zuquan, a resident of Nanxujiawan, Wusong, has a daughter named Xiuling, 21 years old. She is intelligent, beautiful, and virtuous. Zuquan loves her very much. In the autumn of last year, he arranged for her to marry Zhang Songbao's son, Lin Geng, from Yinxiang District. After the marriage, the couple was initially harmonious, but recently Lin Geng's behavior changed drastically. He neglected his business, frequented brothels, and paid no attention to his family, treating his wife like a thorn in his side. He also pawned all of Xiuling's dowry and ornaments. When Xiuling kindly advised him, she was beaten. This spring, she attempted suicide by drowning but was rescued by neighbors and survived. Zuquan then sent Xiuling back to her parents' home. However, Xiuling, due to her husband's immorality and repeated beatings, was constantly in tears and lamented her misfortune. She repeatedly attempted to hang herself to end her life, but her mother always detected it beforehand and persuaded her. Recently, Lin Geng pretended to repent and went to his in-laws' house to lure Xiuling back, intending to sell her. Xiuling found out and fled back to her parents' home to tell her father. Zuquan was furious when he heard that his son-in-law was so vicious and that it would be impossible to live together. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he invited relatives and the matchmaker from both sides to Xu's house for a major negotiation. As a result, Lin Geng wrote an agreement, and both parties dissolved the marriage relationship and severed their marital ties.</p>

<p>Li Hua, the 22-year-old wife of Li Dezhang, a native of Funing who resides at No. 11 Hengkang Lane, Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, is a simple and honest woman from the countryside. On May 20th of this year, a man was beaten to death in a latrine in Siping Lane, causing a sensation in the neighborhood. Li's cousin, Yang Li, also went to Li's house and accompanied Li Hua to watch the event. Unexpectedly, she never returned. Since his wife's disappearance, Li has inquired about Yang Hua, but she has also avoided him. Just yesterday, Li encountered Yang Li on the north side of the railway and took her to the Fourth District Police Station, asking her to hand over his wife. They were instructed to hand her over to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Female Hostess Cohabitates with Customer</h3>
<p>Wild Ducks Caught Together</p>
<p>Jin Mei, a 23-year-old hostess at the Sincere Company Amusement Park, is a native of Cixi, Ningbo. Her mother's maiden name is Sheng. Nine years ago, she married Chu Jishun, thus becoming Chu Sheng. Chu Jishun is a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, and runs a clothing store at No. 27 Yong'an Lane, Bair Road, Taiping Bridge, in the French Concession. However, as Jin Mei is a hostess, she naturally entertains both new and old customers. Yang Chunxi, a native of Wenzhou, who works as a "runner" at the rice boat dock in the South City, often visits the Amusement Park. Every time he comes, he always asks Jin Mei to make tea. He is generous, so he comes every day and gradually becomes familiar with her. They develop feelings for each other, and their love blossoms. They agree to rent a small house together at No. 43 Xinmatou, South City, and live together. But when Chu heard about it, he gathered a group of people and went to catch the pair of "wild ducks" at 12:00 AM the other night. They called the police, who arrested them and took them to the First District Police Station. Yesterday, they were sent to the local court for interrogation and detention.</p>
<h3>Woman Accuses Husband of Bigamy and Abandonment; Verdict to be Announced</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuan, a woman, sued her husband, Zhang Miaolin, in the local court for bigamy and abandonment, requesting a divorce. The court has held two hearings, but the defendant has failed to appear, preventing a final resolution. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held, and both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared as summoned. The plaintiff, Zhang Yuan, testified that she was 33 years old, a native of Sha, and currently resided at No. 98 Yuan Yu Lane, opposite the Sanxin Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. She said that the defendant beat her and committed bigamy with Zhang, which is why he drove her out. She returned to her mother's house on May 4th of this year. (Question) When did you marry? (Answer) We were married in October of the 11th year of the Republic [1922]. (Question) Did he injure you when he beat you? (Answer) Yes, I was injured. I reported it to the police station at the time, but they said it wasn't their concern. After Zhang entered the family, the defendant ordered me to move to the back building, which I refused to do, so he abused me. (Question) Why didn't you sue him for bigamy at the time? (Answer) I didn't understand. (Question) Why don't you sue him now that you know? (Answer) I am mindful of our marital relationship and took a step back, so I didn't file a lawsuit, etc. Next, Zhang Miaolin testified that he was 31 years old, a native of Nanhui, and ran the Zhang Guoji Red Gang Clothing Store at No. 6 Tianlin Lane, Tiantong'an. He said that the plaintiff was his legal wife. (Question) Why did you beat her? (Answer) I didn't beat her. (Question) Why did you marry Zhang again? (Answer) Zhang is her little sister; she is not a wife. (Question) If she is not a wife, why did you order the plaintiff to move to the back building? (Answer) I didn't move her. (Question) You are an artisan who already has a wife and still wants to take a concubine. Do you know that you are breaking the law now? (Answer) It was the plaintiff's suggestion. I treated the plaintiff very well. She was walking on the road with a shop worker on April 6th of this year, which I witnessed, etc. The judge asked the plaintiff, "You have been married for many years. Is it still possible to reconcile?" The plaintiff answered, "I must divorce him to protect my life." The judge then questioned the defendant, "Zhang was married in February of this year. How can she have a child who is about to have a full moon?" (Answer) We knew each other for a long time. The official said, "If Zhang does not leave, then the plaintiff cannot be with you." (Answer) Divorce is possible, but I spent 1,400 yuan to marry her, which should be returned." The official said, "How about an unconditional divorce with no returns?" The defendant said, "I don't want to." Then the arguments began, with lawyers for both sides debating each other. The defendant's lawyer claimed that the plaintiff had cohabitated with clothing craftsman Lu Xigen in a rented house on North Sichuan Road and that the landlord could prove it. Prosecutor Lei then came to the court to express his opinion. The judge then announced that the debate was over and that the verdict would be announced at 10:00 AM on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>A Reprehensible, Frivolous Young Man</h3>
<p>Teasing a Female Worker in a Vacant Lot</p>
<p>Huang, the 17-year-old daughter-in-law of Chen Jiaming, a native of Tongzhou who resides at No. 44 behind Yangjing Temple in Pudong, is petite and pretty and works in a yarn factory in West Shanghai. She goes out early and returns late, as usual. Huang left work at 6:00 PM the other night and was walking past the factory gate when she was suddenly accosted by two young men who were smiling and making advances. She ignored them and walked with her head down. As she approached the Pudong side and boarded the ferry, the two young men followed her onto the ferry and followed her all the way. At the vacant lot of Xiaoshichiao in Yangjing Temple, it was already dark. One of the men suddenly rushed in front of Huang and blocked her way, teasing her and intending to commit indecent acts. In her panic, she shouted loudly and was pushed to the ground, injuring her hands and ribs. Fortunately, she was not far from home. Her father-in-law, Chen Jiaming, heard the shouting and rushed out. Seeing that things were not going well, the two young men fled in different directions. One of them was caught and taken to the Third District Public Security Bureau for questioning. The man confessed that his name was Zhang Chengxiang, 22 years old, a native of Tongzhou who worked as a factory worker at No. 34 Xujiazha. He claimed that he saw Huang arguing with another man on the road and that he stepped forward to mediate and did not tease her, etc. He was ordered to be detained for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Wife's Misconduct</h3>
<p>Two Months' Imprisonment Suspended</p>
<p>Husband Takes Her Back and Disciplines Her</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongwen, who resides at No. 97 Min Ti Ni Yin Road in the French Concession, hired lawyer Yao Zhaodi yesterday to represent him in the French court's criminal court, alleging that the plaintiff had married Wu as his wife more than ten years ago, and they had children. At first, they lived in harmony, but last year, Wu suddenly changed her behavior and had an affair with a Wang. She successively took out ornaments and sold them for use more than once. This time, on the 27th of last month, she ran away from her husband without permission and was taken away with gold jewelry worth more than 3,000 yuan. The plaintiff searched everywhere to no avail until he learned the other day that Wu and Wang were cohabitating at No. 8 Pushi Lane, Baishi Road. He immediately reported it to the police and sent detectives to arrest her and confiscate the stolen goods and a folding fan and ring belonging to Wang. However, Wang was on the run and had not been apprehended. The defendant was so restless and asked for severe punishment and that Wang be sent to court for interrogation. Zhang Zhongwen, the plaintiff, also claimed that his wife had run away once before, and he had taken her back after his brother came to persuade her, hoping that she would repent and start anew. Unexpectedly, she relapsed recently. He asked for an investigation and the return of the stolen goods. When questioned, Zhang Wu confessed that her husband had changed his mind after taking a concubine and often abused her. On the 27th of last month, when her husband came home late, she asked him, but he became angry and beat her again. That is why she left in anger and lived elsewhere and dared not have an affair with Wang. Judge Zhu Cheng sentenced Wu to two months in prison suspended for five years and ordered her to be taken back by her husband for discipline. The property inside No. 8 Pushi Lane was allowed to be taken back by the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Zhu Suzhen Accuses Kong Jingqing of Neglecting Support</h3>
<p>The identity issue will be determined before further questioning.</p>
<p>Zhu Suzhen, a young woman from Kunshan who resides in Chengji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, recently accused her husband, Kong Jingqing, of neglecting her support. The case was heard in the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear. According to Zhu, she was a prostitute before the defendant became a customer. Later, because they were both happy, they talked about marriage. At the end of the 14th year [1925], she married him as a concubine. At the end of the 15th year [1926], the defendant took her to the Ping'an Small Hotel on Edward Road, claiming to take her back to his hometown in Ningbo, and left her in the hotel. The defendant never came back. At that time, she was four months pregnant. Later, because she had been waiting for a long time and did not see the defendant, she rented a place to live alone and has been living on borrowed money ever since. What she is asking for now is to order the defendant to pay her support money of 8,000 yuan, etc. The defendant's lawyer argued that the plaintiff was initially the defendant's concubine, but she has been separated from him for four years. The child she gave birth to cannot be recognized by the defendant. Because they have been separated for a long time and have nothing to do with each other, the defendant did not appear in court today, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the defendant currently works for a foreign company and that his father-in-law is a compradore for the company. The defendant is deeply afraid that this matter will be known to his father-in-law, which is also a reason for the abandonment. In addition, the defendant once forced the plaintiff to borrow 10,000 yuan from her sister. Because the plaintiff's sister is married to a wealthy merchant, the plaintiff had no choice but to ask her sister for a loan, but she was refused. Seeing that the loan was unsuccessful, the defendant also denied the biological child. In fact, the child is indeed the defendant's and there is evidence to prove it. If the defendant were to appear in court today, he would probably be saddened by the plight of the plaintiff and her son, who are helpless, etc. Judge Yang instructed that the identity issue of the plaintiff should be determined before further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wang Mengnian Sentenced to Ten Years for Counterfeiting Currency</h3>
<p>In addition to a fine of 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Wang Mengnian, a native of Jiangbei, has been punished by the authorities twice before for counterfeiting currency. He did not repent and secretly set up a counterfeiting machine for auxiliary coins in a house at No. 455 Edward Road, disrupting the financial system. Han Peisheng, a detective of the exchange company, found out about it and secretly searched the house at 5:45 PM the other day, confiscating 971 counterfeit double dimes, 34 single dimes, and more than 20 battery molds. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for investigation. Wang confessed that it was done by two Xu who are on the run. Judge Wu verified the confession and sentenced Wang Mengnian to ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan. If he is unable to pay, he will be imprisoned for an additional year. The counterfeit coins were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Child's Body Drowned Due to Careless Swimming</h3>
<p>At 12:10 PM yesterday, the body of a boy was found in the Suzhou River near the Wusong Wharf. He was about twelve or thirteen years old and had no clothes on. It is likely that he fell into the river due to careless swimming and drowned. The Chinese police of the No. 14 Water Patrol Station recovered the body and sent it to the Salvation Bureau for collection.</p>
<h3>Xu Gengshou Drowned in the River</h3>
<p>Xu Gengshou, a native of Changshu, earned a living by steering wharf boats. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, Xu was contracted to load 200 bags of white rice from Dingtai Company in Pudong and transport them to the Santai Wharf in Puxi for transshipment to Taizhou native Liu Zhenfu's Jiangbei boat for transport to other ports. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the wharf, Xu was about to transfer the rice bags to Liu's boat. Because of the hot weather, Liu refused to start the transshipment and agreed to postpone it until evening. Xu refused because he did not have time, which led to an argument between the two that escalated into a major conflict. As a result, Xu lost his balance while standing on the rice bags, slipped, and fell into the river. By the time they managed to rescue him onto the boat, Xu was already dead. Xu's wife, Lu, arrived after hearing the news and took Liu Zhenfu to the Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau to demand punishment. After questioning by Team Leader Xu during the preliminary hearing, Liu confessed that he was 34 years old and that the deceased Xu Gengshou was flirting with his sister on the boat at the time. When he saw it, he scolded him. Xu was ashamed and angry and cursed back, jumping around between the rice bags and accidentally slipping into the river. He did not beat him, etc. The team leader, considering that the case involved a human life and was important, ordered that the original complaint be prepared and that the parties be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse Run Over by a Car Found at the Huacheng Road Intersection</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, a pedestrian run over by a vehicle was found at the intersection of Huacheng Road, Yangshupu. The victim was about 30 years old, looked like a worker, and was wearing a white cloth shirt, blue cloth pants, bare feet, and straw sandals. His skull was broken and covered in blood, a tragic sight. Street police No. 2704 arrived and transported the body to Tongren Hospital and then to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Teahouse Worker Killed After Being Hit By Car</h3>
<p>Zheng Qingfang, 39 years old, a native of Ningbo who worked as a teahouse worker at the Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road, was walking near Dongyouheng Road at 7:00 AM yesterday when a No. 5397 cargo truck from the Tailong Flour Company suddenly drove by. Zheng tried to avoid it but was knocked to the ground, his left leg crushed. The scene was too gruesome to bear. Police No. 2570 checked and found a hired car to send him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the wound was too large, and he bled excessively. He died at 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Two Boats Collide, Child Falls into the Water</h3>
<p>The Father Was Saddened</p>
<p>Xun Laosi, a native of Yancheng, was engaged in boating. Yesterday, he docked his boat near the Fuxin No. 7 Factory on the Suzhou River when Zhang Xingsheng's boat, a dock foreman, raised the anchor of Xun's boat because it was close to the beach. At that time, Zhao Xinli, a native of Qingpu, was driving a boat and accidentally collided with Xun Laosi's boat. Xun's young son, who happened to be standing at the bow of the boat, lost his balance and was shaken into the water, drowning. The Water Patrol Team sent police to take the group to the team for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fire at Tiande Road, Fortunately No Injuries</h3>
<p>Details of the major fire at the Tiande Road shack the night before were reported yesterday. According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau, none of the affected households were injured or lost family members. However, those who lost their homes were sheltering on the roadside in a miserable state.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Raises Positions of Secretaries, etc. in Various District Offices</h3>
<p>The district offices of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau handle prohibited cases on a daily basis. Each district office has one or two secretaries and scribes who specialize in writing reports and preparing documents, which are carried out under the supervision of the district chiefs. Director Yuan believes that the territory under the jurisdiction of each district office is vast, and the population is increasing daily. All daily prohibited cases are extremely complicated. It is impossible for anyone with mediocre talent and knowledge to handle the work of the secretaries and scribes in each district office. He now plans to carefully screen and raise the positions, renaming the position of secretary to document officer and the position of scribe to clerk. A notice has now been issued to the captains of the various district offices to conduct strict assessments and submit them for review.</p>
<h3>Three Lawyers Move to New Offices</h3>
<p>Lawyer Cai Ni Peijun's business has grown, and the original location is no longer sufficient. Starting from the other day, he and lawyers Shen Zhaojiu and Shi Qinghua moved to No. 565, West, Baike Road (i.e., at the intersection of Da Tong Road). The telephone number is 31234.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Kodak Service Center</h3>
<p>Photography services in our country have rarely paid attention. Now, photographers Zhang Ruijian, Gong Zhefu, Chen Jingkang, and others have launched the Kodak Service Center, specializing in serving travelers and patrons. When ships and trains arrive every day, special personnel are sent to receive travelers' film and develop it for them. The same day, new film can be exchanged to save travelers from having to run around, saving time and convenience, and charging low prices. In this sweltering heat, this service center will be of great convenience to many travelers. This kind of organization is still a pioneering effort in our country. If ladies in this port have any photos, they can also have them developed at any time. For the sake of ordinary family movies, there is also a free screening service. It is hoped that all circles will not miss this opportunity. If you want to watch the movie for free, you can call and come to the screening at any time. The service center is now located at No. 25 Nanjing Road (inside Watson's Pharmacy). The telephone number is 18000.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introductions</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of New Works by European Writers: Two Brothers (Manru)</h3>
<p>A novel by the French writer Prévost</p>
<p>Maurois recently said, "Prophecy is a dangerous thing, but I will still make a prediction. I will tell you the names of three writers who are not yet thirty years old. If my guess is correct, these three people will occupy very important positions in French literature in the future. These three people are André Chanson, André Malraux, and Jean Prévost." Now we want to talk about the last one, Prévost, because he recently published a novel (Les Frères Bouquinquant).</p>
<p>Prévost is a short, fat man with yellow hair and blue eyes. His forehead is lined, and his face is like a pirate. He is a very enthusiastic athlete and a good boxer. He studied at the École Normale Supérieure, which is both beneficial and dangerous for a writer. It is beneficial because it can provide its students with a very thorough education. It is dangerous because it can make its students unable to get rid of the pedantic habit of quoting scriptures and chewing words for life.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Prévost himself has an amazing energy and a superb taste. He overcame all the elements that could damage his talent, thus becoming a rising talent in the French literary world. He has now written two books, both of which are extraordinary works. The first one is Dix-huitième Année, which very faithfully and sincerely depicts the life of a French young student holding progressive ideas right after the European War. This is a confession and an autobiography. The second one, which was just published, is Les Frères Bouquinquant, a novel about the life of the masses with many advantages.</p>
<p>The plot is very ordinary. The plot can almost be found in the archives of the police station. Remember (André Gide) loved to use this kind of plot. The story is about a young mechanic who became his sister-in-law's lover on a Seine barge. Later, he killed his brother because his brother beat his sister-in-law. When the matter was discovered, the woman admitted that she had committed the murder. In this way, she saved her lover, and her lover had no choice but to accept her sacrifice. The plot is roughly like this, but the story itself is not important. What is important is the author's novel approach and special style of depicting workers. Most writers write about the lives of workers by observing from the outside, without understanding the people themselves, so they often fail to be accurate. For example, Zola's characters, although epic in their grandeur, are not realistic. Prévost is different. His book is full of reality. He writes out the complexity of their character. He makes us understand that the moral standards of the masses are often different from those of the bourgeoisie, but their desires are the same. This novel can be said to have exhausted the psychology of the French people.</p>
<p>Prévost has great ambitions for this novel. His wish is to write this novel like Hugo's "Les Misérables." This is naturally an exaggeration, but the ambition of this young writer can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Loti Sheya (Manru)</h3>
<p>A novel by the French writer Jolo</p>
<p>In the current literary world of Paris, few people are as famous as Edmond Jaloux. First, he is a critic of Les Nouvelles Littéraires with a very good reputation. He has introduced many foreign literary works to French readers, and these works have had a very good influence. Second, he has always been willing to help young writers, so his interpersonal relationships are very good. Third, he is the first Frenchman to introduce new German literature and has a very good relationship with Hofmannsthal and others.</p>
<p>But Jolo is not just a critic, he is also a novelist, especially a truly talented person. His knowledge, wisdom, and sensitive conversations are very tempting. People who meet him for the first time see his calm face and slow, elegant voice and always think he is a quiet and pragmatic person. But after a while, they will find that he is a person full of mysterious emotions and poetic interests. Jolo's books are like his conversations. In his books and in his conversations, the most lovely thing is the feeling that there is a more beautiful world in front of you, and this more beautiful world is entirely composed of the memories of the books he has read, which is the synthesis of the literary fantasy world.</p>
<p>His book "Loetitia" is written with this kind of poetry. It tells the story of the girl Loetitia. Loetitia fell in love with a great German poet, Walter Graul. However, she does not know him and has never met him. Graul's personality is very similar to two great poets. The quality of his poems is like Rilke, and his need for a woman is like Shelley. Every woman, before he lives with her, he regards as a celestial bodhisattva. But once he lives with her and discovers that she is just an ordinary person, he is very dissatisfied and immediately destroys his own idol. Loetitia, like other women, was destroyed in this way.</p>
<p>These few short sentences cannot express the magic of this novel. Jolo wrote this novel as if Allan Poe was writing "The Fall of the House of Usher," shrouding the failure history of this beautiful love in a mysterious and vague atmosphere, making readers involuntarily feel depressed and sad.</p>
<h3>The Wilderness Society Establishes a Publishing Department</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wilderness Society at 34 Ferren Road has been established for one year.

<p>Juhai Market</p>
<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>Of the domestic plain, wide, tight, pure wool camel hair sold on the market, only the products of the Xinda, Shengda, and Weilun factories are the best. This is because these factories were the first to invent domestic camel hair. Although other small factories have appeared recently, the quality of their products is far inferior to that of the three factories. The quality and materials of the products of the three factories are durable, and the colors are bright and trendy, so the cost is higher. However, the factories do not seek immediate benefits but seek the application of society, so the price is extremely low. It is reported that the three factories, in order to jointly promote domestic goods, are contacting customers inside and outside the local area. If you want to purchase the goods of the three factories, you can contact any of the three factories, and a large number of samples are available to be mailed upon request.</p>
<p>The Changsha Wanyuan Xiang Embroidery Shop, located at the west end of Huajin Lane, Sanma Road, claims that the products of this shop are of excellent quality and the prices are fair. It has always been praised by Shanghai people, and the business is very prosperous. Recently, a large number of embroidery products have been transported from the Changsha factory. The patterns are novel, gorgeous, and elegant, making them the most suitable gifts for society. This shop sells them at a special low price to welcome customers.</p>
<p>The Miaoji Department Store on North Sichuan Road claims that the company, in view of the recent abnormal heat, has rushed to handle a large number of wool men's and women's swimming suits and summer Western-style children's shirts and jackets. All sizes are available, and the patterns are novel and trendy. During the nine-week anniversary period, swimming suits are sold at a discount of 1.8 yuan to 8 yuan per piece, and children's shirts and jackets are sold at a discount of 1 yuan to 1.35 yuan per set. In addition, lottery tickets are still given away. The weather has been hot in recent days, and buyers have been extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The Quanqiu Shoe and Hat Shop on Dongmen Road claims that the shop has been open for two months and the business is booming due to fair prices and careful selection of materials. From now on, there will be a reduction in sizes and the gift of Shente factory artificial chopsticks will continue to be given to thank the patronage of everyone.</p>
<p>The Tongchang Xiabu Shop on Beishi Road claims that since June 16th, when various xiabu, ramie yarn, feather yarn, foreign textiles, foreign gauze, foreign yarn, and all other summer clothing materials were sold at a 10% discount, both retail and wholesale have been very successful. There are only four days left in the price reduction period (that is, it ends on the 15th).</p>
<p>The Longji Trading Company claims that since the company was established, the business has been very developed. Manager Yang Liangbi, assistant manager Li Yanhui, and business director Li Yueting are all rising stars in the business world and have extensive social connections. Recently, the original Fujian Road address was not enough for the office, so they rented a new house at 92 Niuzhuang Road. The decoration has been completed and they moved to the new house a few days ago. The scale is grand, and new and old customers have come one after another. Manager Yang plans to hold a new house moving anniversary in the near future.</p>
<p>Lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang claims that the Supreme Court has special contract lawyers to handle third-instance cases from various provinces and regions, so that they can appear in court to handle everything. This is similar to the so-called public defender and state lawyer in the Criminal Procedure Law. The number of lawyers ranges from four to eight. A few days ago, the Supreme Court sent a letter to the lawyer at 10 Songshan Road, enclosing case rules and inviting him to be a contract lawyer for the court, with the consideration of public interest and willingness to take on the role. The lawyer replied that he would agree to take the position because it was his duty.</p>
<p>The American Quaker Oats Company claims that the company's Old Man brand Quaker Oats is the most nutritious food and has long been famous throughout the world. Since it was promoted in China, it has been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. In order to facilitate public recognition, from the 7th to the 12th of this month, the company will publicly demonstrate and explain various cooking methods in the canned food section on the lower floor of the Wing On Company, and will provide oatmeal for people to try for free. In recent days, inquiries and tastings have been extremely enthusiastic. The deadline is approaching. If there are still those who have not yet learned about the true value of Quaker Oats, please do not miss the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Publishing News</h3>
<p>The Beijing Pictorial has been published for five years. It was changed from a daily to a monthly publication the year before last. The content is beautiful and complete, and the sales volume has increased daily. Now it is known that the newspaper has been greatly expanded since the 24th of last month (that is, the 89th issue) and changed to a three-day publication. The paper and printing are particularly exquisite, and the pictures and text are even richer than before. A subscription for fifty issues costs only 2.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>Doctor Shao Yiqun has been running a clinic on Menala Road. Because the houses there are about to be renovated, he moved the clinic to the east end of the Great World on Adowa Road yesterday, and moved the residence to 243, south of Weihaiwei Road, South Chengdu Road. In addition to seeing patients at the clinic from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, he is also available at the residence at other times.</p>
<p>Professor Yin Benqiang of the Nanyang and Southeast Medical College claims that the doctor invented a kind of filamentous fungus in 1926, which was deeply appreciated by experts when he spoke at the Japanese Medical Association and was published in various newspapers. Now, the Japanese government, in view of Yin's great contribution to the academic world, has specially awarded him a doctorate in medicine. Although there are many Chinese students studying in Japan, very few can obtain the highest degree. The doctor is a specialist in dermatology, venereology, and urology, and is also proficient in X-rays. He has served in the Tokyo Imperial University Hospital for many years and has been highly valued by Professor Dohi and Professor Toyama. His knowledge and experience are unique. This time, he was hired by Nanyang to take up a teaching position. In addition to teaching, he sees patients at 24 Songshan Road, French Concession, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Qingyun Road World Grand Theater in Zhabei claims that the theater has received requests from all walks of life to re-release the complete "Orphan of the Valley," which was negotiated with the Mingxing Company and has now been approved. The film stars Zhang Zhiyun, Yang Naimei, and others. The plot is excellent and the purpose is profound. It has long been known to people from all walks of life and need not be repeated. It is said that the film has a total of twenty episodes and will be shown all at once. It is also heard that the theater, in order to give preferential treatment to the audience, is giving away a cigarette case with a portrait of the movie star Hu Die with each ticket.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Dongfang Sound Film Theater claims that Mr. Guo Ziyi, a film entrepreneur in Shanghai, and Mr. Shao Shuji, a senior member of the film industry, recently realized that sound films can provide the ultimate in audio-visual entertainment and are a good form of recreation for society. Although sound films have flourished in Shanghai, a prosperous city like Suzhou does not yet have a sound film theater for men and women to enjoy, which is somewhat regrettable. Therefore, they went to Suzhou to invite comrades Song Ye and others to organize the Dongfang Film Company. While building a new-style theater, they first rented the original site of the Guanqian Grand Stage to establish the Dongfang Film Theater, which specializes in screening famous American film companies such as Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, and Fox. The interior decoration and the installation of projectors and microphones have been fully equipped by Western technicians from Shanghai, and everything has been renewed. The seats are comfortable and the prices are low. It is now scheduled to open three times a day and night on the 14th of this month, that is, next Sunday. The first film is Paramount's famous song and dance blockbuster, "The Magnificent Prince," followed by "The Broadway Melody of 1929" and other great films.</p>
<p>The Zhongshan Theater claims that the Xinya Technical Troupe is performing amazing and rare stunts at the theater, such as bottle juggling, table balancing, magic balls, the world in the air, and beautiful women walking on tightropes, which surpass the Jingu Skills Troupe from Japan that came to Shanghai the year before last. Therefore, the number of spectators has not decreased due to the hot weather. In order to popularize the eye-opening experience for those who have not yet visited the theater, the theater has specially retained the troupe for one more day today.</p>
<p>The Empire Theater announced on the 11th that the theater has been showing Tianyi's new film "Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage" starring Chen Yumei and Sun Min since yesterday. This film is extremely realistic in its portrayal, and there are many insertions of rural flavors in the film, such as folk festivals with red men and green women passing by, as well as the flirtation in the tofu shop and the depiction of the dark life in the Qiantang County government. They are all able to be close to and intriguing. At the same time, the various dances and the vaudeville of Liu Chunsan and others are both erotic and comical, and are also wonderful and worth seeing. Therefore, all three shows were sold out yesterday.</p>
<p>The Wuchang Grand Theater claims that the films starring George O'Brien, the star of "The Flood," have all been praised. "The Prison Couple" is his latest masterpiece, and the scene of the prison being burned in the film is particularly exciting. The film will be shown at this grand theater from today. The theater gives away exquisite round fans with each ticket every day, so business has been fairly good in recent days.</p>
<p>The Fudan Film Company claims that the company's large-scale production "The Forty-Eight Heroes of the Jianghu, Part 1: Burning the Seven-Star Tower" has been praised as a martial arts film with unique interest since it was premiered at the Central Theater last month. The photographer Wang Shizhen used many bizarre and varied photography methods in this film, which can arouse the audience's interest. The film will be shown at the New Central Theater from today. When the film was shown at the Central Theater, it was extremely crowded every time. It is predicted that the New Central Theater has fewer seats and will be more easily sold out. Those who want to get good seats are requested to come early.</p>
<p>The Jinan Company claims that the company has received much praise from all walks of life since the premiere of "The Twenty-Four Heroes of the Jianghu." The company does not dare to be complacent and is extremely willing to improve. This film was started in the autumn of last year and has been in production for a long time. The talents, scenery, and photography in the film have all been considered for a long time, so the results are very satisfactory. Now that the film is being premiered at the Central Theater, in order to provide a cool summer for old customers, the company has specially invited the Asia Circus Troupe, which has just returned from Sumatra, to perform various novel techniques, including the aerialists on stage and the aerial hoop jumping, which are the most difficult and can be called rare. At that time, it is hoped that all circles will arrive early to avoid missing out.</p>

<h3>The Dramatic Movement That Youth Should Strive For (Ji Ping)</h3>
<p>The dramatic movement seems to have recently attracted social attention. Generally, those engaged in this movement are eagerly hoping for its success. This naturally provides them with some comfort. However, what exactly is its content in reality? What kind of impression does it give us? This cannot but make us feel a huge crisis.</p>
<p>There are probably dozens of theater groups in Shanghai, including small-scale organizations in various schools. In the past few months, we have seen the two public performances of the Art Theater Society, the "Dog's Dance" of the Xin You Theater Society, the "Merchant of Venice" of the Drama Association, and the recent "Carmen" and Fudan Society's "Cyrano." In the process of these performances, we can see that there has been considerable attention paid to both the theater and the actual performance. However, "the most important scripts" make people shake their heads in disappointment. Except for the Art Society and the Drama Association's "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Ah Zhen," which contain sufficient propaganda meaning and serve as political tools, most of the rest can be said to be biased towards romantic love affairs, mainly for the meaning of enjoyment. These are indeed constrained by the current society, that is, the general preference of the current society is such, and in order to cater to the psychology, it has to be so. However, as a result, we feel that apart from sexual hints to young people, there is nothing else. Is this nothing else the main purpose of our dramatic movement?</p>
<p>Drama is a comprehensive art. It is an art that directly expresses human life with sound, color, and moving three-dimensionality, that is, with time and space. Based on the synthesis of all senses, it makes people feel. Its artistic expression style is the most complex and closest to the style of human life. Therefore, it is required by the majority of people and has a profound and broad intrusive special power into the majority of people. In ancient societies, the occurrence of drama was very early. It is a product of the nation and a representation of national culture. Especially in religious countries, it has become a ceremony to respect the gods. However, in the autocratic feudal society, it has mostly become a tool for the emperors to anesthetize the majority of people, and the content of the drama is only "going to the capital to seek fame" and "eliminating evil and evil." This kind of old drama is still preserved in the countryside and cities, and the past emotions and emotions that have been infected are still very rich. In such a situation in the drama world, it is necessary for us to rise up to overcome this kind of toxic and build a new drama. This necessity has produced the dramatic movement. Since the dramatic movement has become a movement, it is naturally not just a natural occurrence, but a purposeful and conscious effort. But this effort has been going on for quite a period of time. What are its results? This cannot but disappoint us, because not only has the old toxic not been overcome, but the so-called new construction is just the same toxic thing. As mentioned above, the central content of this movement at present, apart from being used as some kind of propaganda, is some romantic things. The result of this kind of thing can only weaken the heroic ambition of young people and create a decadent attitude, and this tendency is now flourishing. Isn't this still a huge crisis?</p>
<p>This crisis is not only about the dramatic movement itself, but also about the future of the nation. Therefore, we must overcome it, and how is this overcoming done?</p>
<p>First, establish a central consciousness. We feel that in the past, the drama movement has seemed to have done a considerable amount of effort to abandon the old drama, but for the new construction, it only knows to pursue innovation blindly, and there is no central consciousness to choose. As a result, it only sells some foreign works to cater to the psychology of low-level tastes, and it is fragmented and cannot give people upward hints, let alone what national culture is. Therefore, in order to require this movement to truly shoulder the great mission in practice, it can only be carried out systematically by establishing a central consciousness as its foundation, generate real power in the masses, and become the highest expression of national culture.</p>
<p>Secondly, the construction of nationalism and the establishment of a central consciousness have become the urgent needs of the current dramatic movement. There is no doubt about this in theory. But what is it that can truly serve as a central consciousness? This can naturally only be determined in the objective facts of the society. We know that drama is originally a product of the nation. Naturally, its highest value can only be estimated from the point of view of promoting the national spirit and upholding national interests. In other words, its greatest task is to promote the evolution of the nation. What is the Chinese nation like now? Undoubtedly, it is trapped in the position of a semi-colonial country that cannot be independent, and the legacy of past feudal consciousness and the current depression are enough to destroy the power of the nation and tend to a more difficult situation. Therefore, the central consciousness of our dramatic movement today must be the construction of nationalism. Starting from this, we must eliminate all things that are coy, obscene, decadent, and harmful to the nation, and awaken the national consciousness, inspire the national vigor, beautify the national life, and concentrate the national strength to fight for the nation in unity. Only in this way can the meaning of the drama itself be unfolded, and only in this way can the mission of this movement be completed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, organize a powerful drama troupe. The crisis and the method of overcoming the general dramatic movement have been theoretically indicated above, but the main thing is still the significance of practice. What is the significance of practice? That can only be the organization of a powerful drama troupe to work hard for this proposition. We know that there are indeed many drama troupes in Shanghai now.</p>
<p>But they all only have negative power and are the root cause of this movement. Therefore, the organization of this powerful drama troupe is necessary, and it must be to overcome the unsound theories and actions of other drama troupes and stand in a leading position as the center of a new movement.</p>
<p>In short, with the progress of history, the past dramatic movement has gradually lost all its significance and has fallen into a huge crisis. Now is the time to break through this crisis and open up a new situation. And this new situation, based on the needs of objective society and accompanying the recent trend of the literary and artistic movement, is inevitably nationalistic. And those who bear this responsibility are inevitably promising young people. Because the talents of drama are multi-faceted, it needs the power of vitality and enthusiasm, sincerity and evolution...and this power is only possessed by young people. At the same time, the liberation of the Chinese nation at present is entrusted to the youth, and the work of the liberation movement is especially to awaken the national consciousness. Drama is the most infectious, so the dramatic movement is an important and powerful part of the whole process of the liberation movement. Only when young people are combined with the purposeful nature of this movement can they be liberated from the current crisis and stand firmly on the stand of nationalism to open up a bloody path, practice the significance of the dramatic movement, and complete the mission that young people should have.</p>
