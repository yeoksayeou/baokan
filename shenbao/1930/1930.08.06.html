<h3>香港中華南遊足球隊將起程</h3>
<p>本月十二首程丨九月中旬返港</p>
<p>先到安南西貢丨再赴南洋羣島</p>
<p>一行二十二人丨領隊葉九臯君</p>
<p>（七月三十一日香港通訉）中華體育會足球隊名震遐邇國人以虎隊之號賜之以其威之不可侮也該隊自春間正式足球賽會結朿後鑑於南邦華僑對該隊久存景仰之心擬乘此機會派隊南遊得在青草綠茵之足球場上與南邦華橋相見而以促進體育之發達此其蓄意之由來也自月前南華足球隊承星洲華人體育會之請拔隊南征當時中華本欲跟踪前往不令南華專美於前消息傳播後舉港人士莫不大加注意因以南華先行中華後繼旣屬空前壯舉抑亦欽羡彼方人士眼福之不淺也但該隊當時因種種關係事未就緒成行與否未便宣揚雅不欲外界加以揣度之辭記者對該隊南遊消息根據星洲方面來訉雖屢紀之但疑雲陣陣莫衷一是且有將不成行之說此乃當時中華對於此舉未有切實表示故予人以疑竇之故耳乃近數日間該隊南征復活之消息甚爲囂鏖記者以事關重大亦各界所急欲明瞭者特向該會辦事人探訪據云此事久蓄本懷前此未便宣佈者以各事籌備未妥耳今經委員會將此事再加討論巳决定派隊南遊並定八月十二日首程若是則該隊與南邦華僑見面之緣爲期不遠矣</p>
<h3>定名意義</h3>
<p>前者中華體育會所擬定祇欲派隊赴星嘉坡故日前所擬定之名稱亦不過赴星足球隊現在各委員之意以爲此次派隊南遊目的是志在得球藝上之揣摩俾下届尋常獎杯足球比賽再作第四届之奪取錦標又創出新紀錄（中華連得三届尋常獎杯巳是新紀錄耳）查南方諸島藏有足球好手甚多固不祗限於星洲一埠故趁此次南遊將一併遄赴其他各埠因之名稱上遂不得不改變昨晚决議改爲中華體育南遊足球隊也</p>
<h3>南遊行程</h3>
<p>計昨晚該委員會所議决派隊南遊各案除恊訂名稱外更有其他事項且定南遊隊於下月十二號啟程乘法國邦船大德能號前往其路程是先赴安南西貢諸埠在該埠或有數場比賽然後再南行赴南洋一帶如星洲山打根泗水爪哇等埠現在預定行期以一月爲限大約九月中旬便可返港以應一九三零至一九三一年之本港尋常足球賽會也</p>
<h3>積極練習</h3>
<p>至於南遊足球隊隊員名單則刻下未能宣佈因球員中或有事未能前往也一行約共二十二人據記者昨晚調查所得該會足球部辦事人務以最强勁之隊伍前往以求於比賽時得有良好之表演際兹升火待發之時巳積極奮練云又領隊人物亦由各球員推舉出來咸屬意於葉九臯君云查本年本港球隊南遊者初有南華足球隊繼而起者又有中華足球隊居兩者之間更有上海樂華體育會所組織之華人遠征球隊（此隊南華與中華均有球員被選參征）南邦華僑愛慕國中足球隊者得此良好機會誠空前未有之盛舉也</p>

<h3>大中輪船失事之真相</h3>
<p>地點在關東灣之復州</p>
<p>委托滿鐵船塢任打撈</p>
<p>本埠恒安公司大中輪船在途失事巳誌本報兹悉該輪失事地點　係在復州並非閩省福州兹將昨得續訊分誌如下</p>

<h3>損失情形</h3>
<p>今次大中輪失事據船主俄人周倉FTsdhann來電報告謂係被大風之冲激以致不能駕駛前船身爲風送上暗礁頭艙在礁石内中艙與後尾尚未套入礁石故在潮漲時前船身約四十尺沉水中後艙則尚可浮起水面約十九尺但前水艙及頭水艙辦倫台夾底等均巳洞破漏水入船而最關切要之船底則未穿漏故猶可設法援救</p>
<h3>拖救辦法</h3>
<p>恒安公司得到船主報告後巳電大連分行向南滿鐵道會社船塢磋商打撈之策昨據電告滿鐵船塢巳派騐船師到失事處勘騐謂可以希望打撈該行復電即令從速撈救自船主以下全部人員均留輪助救滿鐵巳派工程師水鬼等到摩起遜島開始工作每日拖救費言定七百五十元據滬行語記者大中輪載重二千三百淨噸此次係空輪失事尚未裝煤可望將其救出也</p>

<p>銀洋收解頻繁…滙拆巿况荒凉</p>
<h3>市場概况</h3>

<h3>厘拆價格</h3>
<p>「洋厘」早巿厘價爲七錢二分八厘七毫半午巿爲七錢二分八厘六毫二忽半結果與前日早巿依舊相同而交易狀况亦遂不如前形勢殊爲淡漠至於去胃中梗宜乎有疲弱之象「銀拆」早午巿仍爲二分鬆濫狀態一仍其舊劃頭及拆牌均無行巿</p>

<h3>期麥一再高騰</h3>
<p>現貨到稀亦好三四分</p>
<p>昨日期麥巿面上下午各月份巿面一致激漲不巳究其原因初則爲洋麥提漲致激動大部分之人心在根本上言以目下之存麥約祇五萬包左右且中次居多高貨甚缺更因内地劃價迄未大廉一般囤户因進價關係非守到價划時不願脫手因此交易所之標準前途殊足爲經營者所考慮也積此情形故近期雖良好遠期則更甚也結果本月份較前日漲七分九月份漲八分十月份漲九分十一月份漲八分十二月份漲一錢一月份漲四分現麥巿况因標準又復飛騰到貨又薄故各檔開價較好三四分開瑶灣宿遷江西汕巿漢口麥五千餘包由福新辦去云</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>新發明之汽車掛車</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>内設廚房臥室餐室</p>
<p>現在汽車事業的進步的健全是無庸疑義的了然而發明儘管發明滿足終還是不易譬如說現在的汽車不宜於長途旅行何以呢因爲裏面地方太小旣不能煑飯又不能睡覺不是狠顯明的缺點嗎爲了要解决這個問題於是平新發明了一件東西這是什麽呢便是一節掛車附在汽車後面的（如圖）製造人是地屈勞臥車公司價值三百八十五元</p>
<p>這一節掛車六尺半闊九尺長六尺四寸高裏面的佈置是合廚房臥室爲一車身是用堅木做的底盤却是堅固的鋼板四壁木板有調劑氣候的功用冬天可以避寒夏天可以郤署在冬天還有汽油火爐可供取暖這種車子最適宜於游獵家附車的車頂和汽車車頂的一樣的質料不畏雨不易損壞的而且上面可以安放一只小船全節車有五只玻璃窗兩只床都是彈簧墊子這節車的重祇有汽車的四分之一上山以及高速度它都可以因此異常利便</p>
<p>詳細的佈置大概如下床四尺闊六尺長兩頭各有一窗有冰箱二可儲冰二十五磅水桶容績爲五加侖不但供給飲料並且要洗衣煑飯電燈由一電池中供給灶是汽油燈的有兩只鍋一只桌可以四人聚餐和打牌兩只椅子也是備休息時用的</p>
<p>裏面的佈置是淡青與奶色如果另行配色的那麽再加十凶便可以這種車的好處在救濟汽車之窮一般遠游客餓了便可以自巳煑飯吃夜了便了安睡人雖在客中與在家一般的舒適現在人家購用附車的巳狠多不時可以卸下非常便利</p>
<p>有人說有了掛車之後速率一定要降低了其實却又不然因爲道車下面也與前車的引擎相通的所以速率毫不受影響登山也不受重大的顛蕩因爲它有一種彈簧來維持勢力均衡的</p>
<h3>發展交通之先决問題</h3>
<p>— 曲紫</p>
<p>處今日之中國欲謀交通發展以言築鐵道必先籌集鉅資經年累月始克通車以言辦航空則飛行安全尚不能取信於人而票價之貴又非社會大多數人力能勝任者故二者一時均無從發展度情論勢惟有修築汽車路較爲輕而易舉耳</p>
<p>嘗調查美國現有公路在每方英里面積内平均有公路一英里我人苟從舊金山乘公共汽車可跨美洲而直達紐約計路長約三千英里一路供給膳宿初不讓火車此項公路路面極堅實極平坦汽車每小時速率大約可繼續駕駛在五六十英里之間路局有鑒於此亦有兼備公共汽車運貨車往來各鄉接送旅客至鐵道幹綫所在者</p>
<h3>加德比築路機器之一種</h3>
<p>我中國向有之道路大多爲行人道祇可通小車以及黄包車欲通行公共汽車及運貨車則車輛本身之重量巳足壓壞路面而有餘遑論載客運貨矣故今日中國需要之公路正欲如美國所有者須堅實而平坦又便於洩水則四季可用而車輛之速率行旅之舒適等問題胥迎刃而解也</p>
<p>近有美國加利佛尼亞州加德比乃汽車公司駐華代表史外波君於上星期四在上海扶輪社聚餐會席上演講加德比乃新式築路機器之功用據云此項築路機器祗需工人二人每天可築路三英里每英里築路費不過十元而巳若以完全人工築路所需費用當十倍於此講後並又開映在平津長途汽車道表演此項築路機器工作之情狀或掘或犁或剷或軋極巧妙之能事爰爲介紹如右儻亦爲關心道路事業者所樂聞歟</p>
<h3>道路車輛管理問題</h3>
<p>— 甲</p>
<p>近年汽車日多路上行駛之管理方法頗費研究美國本薛凡花州大學政治學敎授馬克唐納曾著一書細論此問題之解决方法兹擇其大要以爲滬上路政之參考資料</p>
<p>路之寛度應照路面車輛多少爲標準造路切勿太窄太短路交叉處之管理燈及各項指示或警告符號文字不可太小顔色必鮮明字句必簡易地位必顯殊入夜尤宜注意終以自遠而近一望而知爲宗旨</p>
<p>路面放寛固爲調劑車輛擁擠之唯一上策惟繁盛街道地價太貴收賣改造須費鉅費不如改行過道長足癤式即將原有行人道併入馬路而於如屋造時第二層之居面液進六尺至十尺爲行人道以層以上仍照原地面積加造（按上路法大馬路巳仿此式）</p>
<p>管車之紅綠燈究與汽車之進行有無害處此節經許多專家考慮僉以綠燈忽改紅燈車必立停及紅燈改綠燈車必爭先</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>衝紅綠之間改　太連每易肇禍有主張加用一琥珀色燈介乎紅綠之間爲一種預備符號又燈光之時間亦爲一問題目下汽車最多之第屈洛脫（Detroit）城（世界汽車業之大本營）近在試騐二種新式路行車燈一俟有効當令各地仿行熱閙街上汽車速度最適當爲一小時十五英里太快則車與車之距離加多深恐前後相撞因之路面之容車量不能充分利用城外大道車輛較少速度自可加高閙巿祗可十五英里</p>
<p>停車塲最佔路面大城巿管理汽車最不易解决之一事停車時間之長短亦隨地方情形而不同有時路面不敷應用大工廠與大商店應自動供給雇員停車空地惟熱閙街道之商店較易戲院尤易良以閙巿地價昻貴且不易得如許空地補救之法祗有特造中央停車大屋以容納之目下一等大城有此式車塲者尚在少數云</p>
<h3>長途汽車行車之規程</h3>
<p>— 李吉</p>
<p>道路爲一國之命脈交通之基礎商業之利器歐美各國莫不以築路爲重任每年財政預算内所費至鉅建設計劃亦最完美我國近鑒於此對於築路工作積極進行不遺飶餘力造成之國道巳有二萬餘里成績頗爲可見</p>
<p>今我國各省均有省道内地亦在開闢長途汽車事業亦同時發展城鄉間之交通因之極感便利在此長途汽車初興時期各地當局雖於交通應事鼓勵然於行車規程亦宜加注意以免發生危險而使建設有所阻碍</p>
<p>美國乘坐公共汽車者每年納逾一薏五萬萬人駛車之慎疏有關民生與社會之安寗美國全國長途汽車聯合會爲保障地方人民與乘客之安全計新訂行車規程一通頗有價值可供我國汽車界之參考研究兹錄其全文於後</p>

<h3>Fourth Route Army Recaptures Changsha</h3>
<p>Occupied the Entire City After Crossing the River from Yuelu Mountain</p>
<p>Bandit Communists Fled Towards the Southeast Gates</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Official sources received a telegram this morning from the naval vessels stationed in Changsha, stating that the Fourth Route Army, which had come to reinforce from Yuanjiang and Yiyang, launched an attack on Changsha by crossing the river from Yuelu Mountain between 1 AM and 5 AM on the 5th. Both sides exchanged heavy fire. The communist bandits retreated while fighting, mostly fleeing out of the city through the southeast gates. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Naval Headquarters News: Upon learning of the fall of Changsha, the Naval Headquarters immediately dispatched the Yongsheng gunboat and the Xianning warship to move as far upstream as possible. The Yongsheng 31 braved danger and went straight to Changsha, ultimately defeating the enemy in a fierce battle upon arrival. The communist bandits were immediately repelled. The Xianning arrived at the Changsha river surface on the 1st and joined the Yongsheng in the defensive mission. The bandits, fearing the power of the naval guns, fled outside the city. Later, as the bandits were not pursued, they adopted a stubborn resistance attitude, firing at the Xianning and Yongsheng warships from time to time. The two warships continued to return fire with artillery. The remaining bandits soon collapsed and fled. In summary, from the 1st to the 4th, the Xianning and Yongsheng warships patrolled the Changsha river surface. At 2 AM on the morning of the 5th, they further provided cover for the army to cross the river from Yuelu Mountain and return to Changsha to take over the defense. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek was very pleased with the Yongsheng's recapture of Changsha and personally sent Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan warm congratulations on the 3rd and issued an order to commend the officers and soldiers of the Yongsheng. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Naval Headquarters received a wireless report from the Xianning warship from Changsha on the morning of the 5th, stating that the communist bandits who had seized Changsha were fleeing towards the southeast gates this morning after being subjected to fierce artillery fire from the Fourth Route Army and the Xianning and Yongsheng warships. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Yongsheng warship has advanced to Xiangxiang Wharf, and the Xianning warship has moved into the vicinity of Shuiluzhou Island. The department has submitted reports to the central government and the Executive Yuan. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>

<h3>Hankou</h3>
<p>Military News: The Fourth Route Army has repeatedly launched attacks across the river from Yuelu Mountain against the communist army for several days. The artillery fire is extremely fierce.

<h3>Hankou</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Changsha, the troops of He Jian, covered by artillery fire from the warships Yousheng and Xianning, launched a second general offensive starting at 9 PM last night and forcibly crossed the river. The communist army was unable to withstand the attack and was repeatedly defeated. At 3 AM this morning, He's troops arrived by boat at Changsha on the opposite bank. At 7 AM, the main force successively landed and entered the city of Changsha, engaging in fierce street fighting for about two hours. At 11 AM, He's troops had completely recaptured Changsha. The majority of the communist bandits fled outside the city of Changsha. Small units, each numbering several hundred, are still lurking in the hills around Tianxin Pavilion south of the city. He's troops are currently pursuing them. (5th Electric Communications Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>

<h3>Hankou</h3>
<p>He Jian's army launched the second battle to recapture Changsha at 9 PM last night, forcibly crossing the river and launching a fierce attack with guns and artillery, repeatedly pressing the communist bandits.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Great Strike in France</h3>
<p>Neither the Indian movement against British rule nor the great strike in France can be resolved in a short time. The Indian movement is a conflict between the liberation of the colony and British interests, so it is not surprising that it cannot be resolved in a short time. However, the great strike in France is merely a domestic labor-capital dispute, which often occurs in various countries. Why can't it be resolved in a short time either? It is not known that domestic disputes must be viewed in light of the national character of the country. Sometimes, due to the national character, the resolution is even more difficult than that of foreign disputes. The French national character tends towards stubbornness. Once there is a dispute, it is impossible to reconcile it in a short time. Moreover, with the global commercial recession as it is today, the capitalist side has no room for concessions, and the labor side has no room for compromise. Then, how can it be easily resolved in a short time? With the trend of the global industrial and commercial world being what it is, merely trying to compete between the labor and capital sides to seek to reverse this decline is absolutely impossible. By extension, trying to compete between countries to reverse this decline is also absolutely impossible. This is because the decline of industry and commerce today has reached a point where it cannot be salvaged. The various countries of the world and the labor and capital sides of each country have all fallen into this predicament and will be indistinguishable from each other. Otherwise, why would countries like Britain, America, Japan, and Germany already be suffering from the panic of commercial recession and increasing unemployment, while France is also experiencing a large-scale strike at this time?</p>

<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Liu Zhi telegraphed from Yanzhou to the capital on the 4th: After our army defeated the enemy near Qu and Yan on the 1st and 2nd of this month, the rebel armies Fu Zuoyi and Li Shengda retreated to the Yaoshankou area north of Sisui, while Zhang Huizhao's troops increased their forces in the Dongping and Wenshang areas, intending to rely on fortifications to resist our army. Because our army was waiting for the arrival of follow-up troops, they confronted the enemy for more than ten days. The rebel enemy then used the dark of night to launch attacks, but they were all repelled and suffered many casualties. On the 29th of last month, our army's deployment was completed, and on the 30th, they began to attack the enemy in the afternoon. The rebel enemy relied on fortifications and resisted stubbornly. Our officers and soldiers bravely advanced and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, fighting fiercely for five days and nights, which was extremely intense. Our right wing braved the rain and advanced fiercely, finally defeating Qin Shaoguan's two brigades of the enemy southeast of Tai'an, at Dianzi, capturing more than 1,000 enemy soldiers and seizing more than 800 rifles. The rebel enemy retreated and defended Luzhuang. Cai's division has already surrounded the enemy and can be resolved soon, and will then occupy Tai'an. The Chen and Dong divisions of our Central Army defeated the enemy in the vicinity of Nanbei Xuzhuang and Zhuangli on the 1st and 2nd, and captured more than 1,000 enemy soldiers, seized two enemy small cannons, four machine guns, and more than 1,000 rifles, and are pursuing them towards Dawenkou. Xia's division of our Central Army broke through the enemy in front of them at dawn on the 2nd, advanced to the enemy positions at Xiema Pavilion, Jiushan, and Geshidian, and captured more than 20 cannons. They are currently pursuing the enemy towards the Nanliao train station. Ma's troops occupied Ningyang on the 2nd and are pursuing them towards Maicheng. The Feng and Qian divisions of our left-wing army broke through the enemy south of the Wen River on the 1st, killing many enemies, crossed the Wen River to the north bank at night, defeated the enemy at Zhangcheng, Nanshaxia, Nanbeiyi, and Ren, immediately occupied it, captured hundreds of prisoners, seized hundreds of rifles, two mountain guns, and four machine guns, and are currently pursuing them towards Feicheng. Our left-flank column broke through the rebel enemy near Fangjia Lukou north of Yuncheng on the 1st, capturing one rebel enemy deputy brigade commander, one deputy regimental commander, and 300 soldiers, and seized 200 rifles. There is still a remnant of the rebel army defending Wenshang City. Our army is currently besieging them and can confiscate their weapons soon. Having suffered this major defeat, the rebel army has lost its elite forces, and its soldiers are demoralized due to the lack of supplies and pay. They are all willing to surrender and unwilling to fight again. The local people in various places are also resisting and responding to our army everywhere by organizing local militias because the rebel army has requisitioned grain, drafted laborers, and committed rape and plunder wherever they have gone. It is now clear that the rebel army's fate has reached its end, and the time for its destruction is at hand. Respectfully reported, Liu Zhi, respectfully stamped. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Nanjing</h3>

(5) The population is too small. (6) External defense is not easy. (7) Transportation to the interior is inconvenient. The benefits of opening Huangpu Port are: (1) There are six years of planning.

<p>The Japanese Cotton Cloth Industry Shows Signs of Revival</p>
<h3>Large Imports from the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Tokyo News: The export of Japanese cotton cloth has recently been stagnant, but exports have resumed. According to a survey by the Japan Cotton Textile Export Association, the export volume in mid-July was 16.03 million square yards, worth 581,000 yuan, an increase of 23% in quantity and 25% in value compared to the previous ten days. Statistics since January show a total of 98,737,000 square yards, worth 59,640,000 yuan, a decrease of 12% in quantity and 33% in value compared to the same period last year. The recent increase in exports is due to the stability of silver prices and the Japanese exchange rate, as well as the entry into the demand season. There have been considerable imports from the three northeastern provinces, and there have been continued transactions with the Chinese side. India also intends to purchase fine cloth, and there have also been transactions in the Near East and Southeast Asia. The Japanese cotton cloth export industry is gradually showing signs of revival.

<h3>Military Situation on the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>Central Army Will Launch General Offensive Within Days</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Central armies on the Jinpu Line have now been completely concentrated and are awaiting the general offensive. According to military sources, the Central forces have been actively advancing on both flanks since the 31st, and there is no definite news of engagement on the front. The enemy's deployment seems to be concentrated mainly in Tai'an, with defenses set up south of Tai'an. In total, the enemy forces on the Jinpu Line are approximately the troops of Fu Zuoyi, Sun Chu, Yang Xiaoou, Guan Fu'an, and Feng Pengzhu. There is news that Yan Xishan will arrive in Jinan, but the Yan army's offensive power is very weak. The Central Air Force, under the command of Yin Huichang, has been launching attacks on enemy positions and rear areas for days, causing heavy losses to the enemy. The armies of Han Fuju, Li Yunheng, and Jiang Guangnai on the Jiaoji Line are also attacking Jinan and Tai'an. It is expected that after the Central forces advance on both flanks, the enemy on the front will retreat without being attacked. (August 3rd)</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Forces in the Nanxun Area</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Civil Affairs Department Announces Command of Bandit Suppression in Twelve Districts</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The 9th Route Army Headquarters believes that Zhu Mao's invasion of Nanchang and its vicinity this time is a full-scale attack and is very fierce. Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province and is very important to the Yangtze River. Therefore, it is temporarily taking a defensive posture to consolidate the rear. Solid fortifications have been built along the Nanxun Railway, the Niuxing Station, the Zhangjiang River, and the vicinity of Nanchang City, and electric grids have been installed with strong currents to ensure safety. The entire 18th Division and the 2nd Garrison Regiment of the Provincial Government are now defending the suburbs of Nanchang and Niuxing Station. On the Jiujiang front, there is a regiment sent by the Central Government under Deng Shuren, a regiment sent by Director He under Guo Rudong, and a brigade from the 50th Division under Tan Daoyuan. In total, there are more than 15 regiments of troops in the Nanxun area, which is more than sufficient for defense. Regarding the communist bandits, according to various reports, most of Zhu Mao's troops are still in Gao'an, presided over by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Puppet Military Commission, and Zhu De, Commander of the Puppet 4th Army. The right-wing bandit troops that attempted to attack Nanchang were defeated by the 浔阳 gunboats in Shengmi Town (30 miles from the province) and retreated to Fanjia Mountain, where they remain. The bandit troops that attempted to attack Niuxing Station previously invaded Changtou稜 (10 miles from Niuxing Station) but were also defeated by the 53rd Brigade and retreated to Qingshan Cao Mountain. Yesterday, the bandit troops in Fanjia Mountain retreated northwest from Gao'an via Fengxin due to our army's shift to the offensive. It is reported that the Zhu bandits extorted tens of thousands of dollars in Gao'an and Shengmi and kidnapped many men and women as hostages. The following is a summary of the Provincial Government's notification: (1) The bandits in Gao'an Fanjia Mountain were attacked by our Dai and Wang brigades, and the entire line was shaken and collapsed to the northwest. (2) President Tan telegraphed that Chen, Vice Minister, has been ordered to bring the Jiang鲲 ship to Nanchang to assist in the battle. (3) The miscellaneous bandits who attempted to attack Jiujiang via Ruichang were also defeated by Deputy Brigade Commander Hong. (5) Shangrao has been recovered by the police force, but the county office's grain receipts and documents have been burned. Post-disaster work is underway.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department previously divided the 81 counties in the province into 15 bandit suppression districts to concentrate forces for searching and suppressing bandits. It has now been changed to 12 districts, each with a commander in charge of commanding, coordinating, and training the local defense forces in the district. The commanders of each district have been announced and are concurrently held by the county magistrates. Their names are as follows: Peng Fusu, Magistrate of Qianshan County, concurrently Commander of the 1st District; Jiang Boxiang, Magistrate of Poyang County, concurrently Commander of the 2nd District; Wang Zhenhuan, Magistrate of Linchuan County, concurrently Commander of the 3rd District; Wang Kaiyuan, Magistrate of Ganxian County, concurrently Commander of the 4th District; Cai Wantang, Magistrate of Nankang County, concurrently Commander of the 5th District; Peng Xueyou, Magistrate of Ji'an County, concurrently Commander of the 6th District; Xiao Jiaxiu, Magistrate of Wanzai County, concurrently Commander of the 7th District; Wang Huan, Magistrate of Fengcheng County, concurrently Commander of the 8th District; Tang Yingguo, Magistrate of Tonggu County, concurrently Commander of the 9th District; Liao Chonglong, Magistrate of Jiujiang County, concurrently Commander of the 10th District; Zhu Yuzhong, Magistrate of Hukou County, concurrently Commander of the 11th District; and Che Fu, Magistrate of Gao'an County, concurrently Commander of the 12th District.

<h3>Wuhan Garrison Command Executes Communists</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Wuhan Garrison Command previously received a report from the Wuchang Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau that they had captured two communist leaders, Cheng Zhiqi and Meng Shangde, and two followers, Cheng Runwu and Song Mingde, and one suspect, Ren Yuzhong, and Liu Weiruo, a member of the school board, at a primary school in Hankou. Liu, etc., were indeed a misunderstanding and were immediately released on bail. Cheng, etc., were handed over to the military court for trial. The court sentenced Cheng Runwu and Song Mingde to six years of imprisonment for their following and supporting actions. Ren Yuzhong was found not guilty and released on bail. Cheng Zhiqi and Meng Shangde were convicted of counter-revolution and sentenced to death. Yesterday, on the 3rd, they were executed by beheading near the Hankou Primary School in Special District 3. In the past, communists in Hankou were executed by shooting. This is the first time that execution by beheading has been carried out. The following is the announcement of the Garrison Command: The case is based on the report of Su Shian, Director of the Wuchang Municipal Public Security Bureau, that Cheng Zhiqi and Meng Shangde, two communist leaders who were gathering crowds for riots, were captured in Yi Sanli, Hankou, and handed over to the headquarters. The military court was ordered to try them and conduct a thorough investigation. It was confirmed that Cheng Zhiqi and Meng Shangde had gathered more than a hundred party members and forcibly invaded Hanyang No. 3 Middle School, forcibly expelling the workers of the school, and continued to coerce the students of Yi Sanli Primary School in Hankou to leave the school. They also served as chairman and recorder, respectively, and resolved to launch a major riot in Yiyuan on a scheduled date, and shouted reactionary slogans. At a time when the reaction is tense and people are panicked, the criminals dared to carry out such a riot in an area full of soldiers and police, with the intention of subverting the party and the country. Their fierce flames of disregarding the government and the rules can be seen. If they are not punished to the fullest extent of the law, there will be no way to curb the revolt and suppress the chaos. Cheng Zhiqi and Meng Shangde should be sentenced to death in accordance with Articles 5 of the Martial Law and Articles 2, 1 and 2 of the Provisional Law for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, respectively, in order to serve as a warning. In addition to signing the order to bring the criminals to the execution ground to verify their identities and execute them, it is urgently announced for general knowledge. Cheng Zhiqi, 27 years old, from Qichun; Meng Shangde, 27 years old, from Zhuxi. (August 4th)</p>
<h3>Military Progress in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>The Six Detained by Lu are Still Safe</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The military operations in Fujian Province are progressing. The 56th Division's troops on the western front have altered their original plan to advance directly along the river. Instead, they will proceed through Da Xiao Xie to Dahu, nearing the Minqing border. The northern route has crossed Beiling and Cailing, advancing towards Gutian. The southern route was originally under the command of Lin Shouguo, the 2nd Brigade Commander of the Marine Corps. However, due to Gao Weiguo and Chen Guohui vying for the defense of Quanzhou, and Gao's troops clashing with the local militia, Yang Shuzhuang specifically ordered Lin to Quanzhou to mediate. Meanwhile, Chen Guohui's troops were ordered to concentrate in Yongchun, awaiting further orders, while Gao Weiguo's troops were to retreat to Huian for their original defense, handing Quanzhou over to Lin's brigade to quell the dispute. Yesterday, Lin telegraphed the province, stating that he had transferred Chen Mingyang's regiment to Quanzhou for defense. However, the long-standing animosity between the militia and Gao's troops is on the verge of erupting, and the local order has not yet been restored after the battles, requiring suppression. Temporarily, it is feared that they will not be able to return to the province. The provincial authorities, in their military campaign against Lu's forces, have requested that the Lin Bingzhou regiment stationed in Nangang be responsible for the southern route, advancing from Yongtai. Yesterday, Liu and Huang responded to the call and entered the province to receive operational plans and replenish military supplies. Ying Zhen, the liaison officer dispatched by the headquarters to Fujian, has gone to southern Fujian to contact Zhang Zhen and Fang Shengtao to coordinate everything. Furthermore, Yan Er'ai, the Deputy Commander of the 56th Division, also returned to the province on July 26th, bringing with him 3,000 Northwestern Army prisoners of war. The division has assigned them to various regiments to participate in the operations. Fang Shengtao, the Special Military Commissioner for the southern Fujian front, has established the Special Military Commissioner's Office in Quanzhou and was inaugurated on the 26th. Currently, Zhang Zhen's division, Wang Zuqing's regiment, and Xiao Shuxuan's regiment of the provincial defense forces have assembled in Tong'an. Chen Guohui's brigade of the provincial defense forces has assembled in Yongchun, ready to advance towards Dehua and Datian. Lu Xingrong considers Dehua and Datian as the rear of Youxi. If there are any changes, it will inevitably shake the foundations, so he must vigorously resist. Therefore, on one hand, he colludes with local bandits in the two counties, including Xu Feilong, Xu Feifeng, You Cifu, and Huang Qilan, to guard the key passes. On the other hand, he deploys Jin Handing's division of rebel troops and Wei Chu's unit to serve as the first line of defense. However, it is reported that Lu's troops have switched from offense to defense. Furthermore, the two counties of Zhenghe and Songxi, previously occupied by Lu's troops in collusion with the bandit He Jinbiao, have been attacked by the provincial government, ordering Liu Zongyi of the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Police to lead troops to advance from Shouning and Ningde. Currently, Liu has recovered the county seat of Zhenghe, and He's bandits are retreating towards Songxi. Yesterday, Liu telegraphed the province, requesting assistance with ammunition for the advance and pursuit. Since the outbreak of war near the Fujian border and the retreat of Lu's forces, conflicting reports have been circulating here regarding the fate of the five provincial commissioners and one bureau chief detained in Youxi and Yanping. Recently, British and American consuls brought missionaries from their respective countries from Yanping to the province, but they only stated that they had not heard any news of the six's deaths, which is not sufficient to be considered conclusive evidence. Upon investigation, on the 19th, Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Naiyuan, Xu Xianshi, and others sent letters from Youxi to their families, stating that the six were still in the Sanshan Guild Hall and Nanjun Guild Hall in Youxi. The letters were sent to a Mr. Chen at the Surveying Bureau for forwarding. However, Chen Naiyuan's letter stated that the weather was hot, and his old illness had recurred. The previously sent digestive and bowel cleansing medications had been used up. He hoped that the hospital director of the Boai Hospital would be consulted to prepare the medications and send them by express mail. He feared that transportation delays might prevent swift delivery. This seems to prove that the six are not dead. (July 29th)</p>
<h3>Likouyi Iron Mine to be Exploited</h3>
<p>The iron ore from the Likouyi Iron Mine in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, has been verified by chemical analysis experts to have a composition of over 65%. However, due to inconvenient transportation, its exploitation has been delayed. Recently, it was heard that Zhao Weishu, the General Manager of Lihua Iron Mining Company, has signed a long-term transportation contract with the railway authorities and is jointly investing in cooperation with the Road and Mining Department of Xinghua Bank, located at No. 48 Sichuan Road, Shanghai. On the 30th of last month, Lu Duyong, the General Manager of Xinghua Bank, signed various contracts for investment and ore sales with Zhao Weishu in the capital. Subsequently, the purchasing rights for the iron ore produced by the mine will be exclusively handled by Xinghua Bank, and mining operations have already commenced. This year, the initial output will be 100,000 tons, which will be shipped overseas in the near future to alleviate the shortage of gold and low value of silver.</p>
<h3>First Examination for County Magistrates in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The second examination for county magistrates in Jiangsu Province was held today (the 5th) at Zhenjiang Middle School. The circumstances of the examination site are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Entrance</h3>
<p>Around 5:00 AM, test-takers thronged the entrance of the Provincial Middle School at Gulougang, shoulder to shoulder, approaching in the dim morning light. Ye Chucang, the Chief Examiner, had stayed overnight at the site the day before. He rose before dawn and, accompanied by the Administrative Director (Secretary-General of the Provincial Government) Jin Baoguang, inspected the premises. At 5:45 AM, the bell rang for assembly.</p>
<h3>Roll Call</h3>
<p>A platform was set up in the center of the assembly hall's stage. Chairman Ye, wearing a silver Chief Examiner badge and a white summer cloth gown, stood upright in the center, holding a red cinnabar pen.

The test paper was rectangular with a red border. On the left was written "Examination Paper, Jiangsu Provincial County Magistrate Examination Committee." A rectangular floating ticket with the number was attached to the lower center, sealed where it met the paper. A white floating slip on the right corner indicated the exam number, test room number, and seat number. There were four papers: (1) Three Principles of the People, (2) Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, (3) Strategies of National Reconstruction, and (4) History of the Chinese National Revolution.

Twenty-three clerks from the Provincial Government were assigned as invigilators to monitor each room.</p>
<h3>Arrangement</h3>
<p>A bamboo and cloth plaque reading "Jiangsu Provincial County Magistrate Examination Site Roll Call Area" was hung over the examination site's main gate. The examination rooms were simply the original classrooms with a paper strip added, indicating the room number. The administrative office was located downstairs in the Qianjin Building. The Chief Examiners' and court supervising officer's rest rooms were upstairs. Armed guards were stationed by the Public Security Bureau from Qianqiu Bridge to the school gate. Inside the gate, in addition to the Provincial Government guard, there were more than ten members of the Provincial Public Security Team on duty. Each officer's badge or symbol was of one of five types: (1) Chief Examiner, silver badge; (2) Supervising Officer, yellow silk symbol; (3) Invigilator, red silk symbol; (4) Staff, white silk symbol; (5) Duty, blue cloth symbol.

<h3>District Office Investigates Suspected Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>The county government previously reported a case based on information from Chen Jinfa, the chief of the Eighth Precinct, that Fang Bokang, the ringleader in the kidnapping of a Lu family member in Zhuangxing, had identified He Guichan, also known as Yao Jun, as an accomplice. The precinct dispatched a secret agent to apprehend him, but he was unexpectedly intercepted and released by Yang Xingsheng, the chief of the Second Platoon of police stationed in Zhuangxing, in front of the platoon headquarters. Despite repeated negotiations, Yang has only promised to return him, with ongoing prevarications. County Magistrate Shen deemed the case significant and found it necessary to investigate He Guixiang's potential involvement. Consequently, he instructed Zhang Fengtai, the chief of the Eighth District, to conduct an impartial investigation. The report states that after the Lu family kidnapping occurred in the Pandian Township of the district, the family received a letter from the kidnappers demanding a ransom. Lu Ziyun, the clan elder, entrusted He Guixiang, a local who currently serves as a captain of a smuggling suppression vessel, to negotiate in Shanghai. However, the negotiation failed due to a disagreement over the price, and the police also ordered him to purchase informants, but to no avail. Ultimately, the capture of the notorious bandits on July 8th was due to a confidential report from the Shanghai Security Corps, assisted by Yang, the platoon leader. While He Guixiang's involvement in the case cannot be fully clarified, the Lu family did entrust him to contact the kidnapper Liu Boxian, also known as Fang Bokang, once. It is possible that the kidnappers mistakenly believed him to be the informant, leading to resentment and complications. However, the Lu family has repeatedly stated that He had no connection to the case after that one contact and is willing to vouch for him. Therefore, the precinct's claim that he is a wanted criminal is unfounded. The allegation that Platoon Leader Yang intercepted and released him is even more speculative. Since He Guixiang was not involved in the case, the platoon leader had no reason to detain him at the platoon headquarters. There was no interception, let alone release. If the Eighth Precinct believes he is connected to the case, they should have dispatched police to escort him. However, according to the platoon headquarters, only one agent arrived at the time and did not explicitly state anything. As everyone saw it, it does not seem to be a false claim. Therefore, the platoon leader could not have known. In conclusion, the main culprits in the Lu family kidnapping have been apprehended, and the truth is known to all. No innocent people should be implicated, lest those who handle the case become discouraged. It is now understood that County Magistrate Shen has reviewed the district's report and, except for dismissing the allegations against Platoon Leader Yang, has ordered He Guixiang to voluntarily surrender himself for questioning, as his involvement falls within the scope of the judiciary.</p>

<h3>Misunderstanding Involving Police Officer and Local Militia</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of August 1st, two patrol boats from the Fifth Water Police Team were sailing from Songjiang back to Jiading, passing through Chonggu Town in the county. They moored in the South Market for the night. Five or six plainclothes patrol officers, including Lu Akun, went ashore for leisure. Li Xueyu, a militiaman from the town's security corps, encountered them while on patrol and, considering their behavior suspicious, questioned them. The police officers refused to explain and resorted to violence, beating Li, who was outnumbered, until he was injured and fled back to the corps headquarters. When Zhou, the corps commander, learned of this, he dispatched the entire corps, armed with live ammunition, to apprehend the officers. The townspeople mistakenly believed that bandits had arrived, causing great chaos. Just as panic was spreading, Officers Wang and Hu learned of the situation and went to the corps headquarters to mediate. Only then did the truth come to light. However, militiaman Li Xueyu's injuries were quite severe, so he was hired a boat that night and sent to the city hospital for treatment. The corps also submitted a report to the county government, requesting a decision.</p>
<h3>Business Competition Leads to Dispute</h3>
<p>Yichangfu Clothing Store in Chonggu Town has been in business for over a decade. Recently, to expand its business, it began selling silk and foreign cloth, leading to intense business competition with Guangfengyi Silk and Foreign Goods Store across the street. A few days ago, a Mr. Dai purchased a Zhang of gauze from Guangfengyi but returned it because he did not like the pattern. Guangfengyi immediately accused Yichangfu Clothing Store of instigating the return, leading to a dispute. The town's chamber of commerce dispatched members to mediate and hold a meeting. The result was that Guangfengyi had no evidence and should not have falsely accused Yichangfu, and formally apologized to Yichangfu Clothing Store.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Construction of New Prison</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court, in order to improve the prisons in each county, dispatched Shi Zeren to Qingpu for inspection. As a result, it was determined that the prison could be improved to a certain extent, but the detention center needed to be completely rebuilt. The court consulted with the county government and local agencies to discuss solutions. They decided to first organize design and fundraising teams to carry out everything. All district chiefs in the county are ex officio members of the prison construction committee, and Zhu Hua, Shen Yansheng, and Yang Lucun were appointed as members of the charter drafting committee. It is said that the construction cost is about 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Solution to Changing Qingpu-Shanghai Route</h3>
<p>The long-distance bus route from Qingpu to the airfield was started in the spring and could have been completed long ago. However, the airfield authorities intervened, stating that the land was within a military area and subject to frequent curfews, so the route had to be changed. After submitting a request to the provincial authorities, negotiations with the Ministry of Military Affairs were unsuccessful. The route has now been changed and the measurement has been completed. It only crosses into Shanghai City, but it is reported that the construction bureau chief has made an informal contact with the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau, so there should be no problems.</p>

<h3>Haining Traveler's Suicide Attempt Foiled</h3>
<p>The defenses of this city have recently been tightened. Zhu Huanbo, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, personally patrols late at night, paying particular attention to out-of-town travelers to prevent bandits from sneaking in. Yesterday (the 4th) around 11:00 PM, Chief Zhu was patrolling Liaodong Hotel and found Zhu Mianzhen in Room 3 acting suspiciously. There were two bottles of sleeping pills, "Medina," on the bedside table, further arousing his suspicions, as well as a letter to his sister. He learned that Zhu had only taken one pill and was not in serious danger. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation. Zhu confessed that he was 21 years old and from Haining. He had been working in a silk factory in Shanghai but had lost his job and was destitute, so he decided to commit suicide. He has a mother and sister at home, etc. The gist of his suicide letter was that he was unlucky, had suffered many setbacks, and voluntarily took poison to commit suicide. His letter to his sister, signed Meizhen, said that she was a virtuous sister and he could not handle the entrusted matters, so please handle it yourself. He could not repay her kindness in this life and would repay her in the next. However, the wording was unclear, so it seems that he was from the working class and was suffering from economic oppression. Chief Zhu, out of concern for human life, ordered him to be detained at the bureau and requested the Haining Public Security Bureau to notify his family to pick him up to prevent him from taking his own life again.</p>
<h3>Auction of Clothing and Jewelry Looted from Sijing Pawnshops</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the looting of Sijing Town by lake bandits, it is now known that the clothing and jewelry looted from Qingyuxiang and He two pawnshops were previously sealed by the county committee, etc. Having been approved for auction, they were transported to Songjiang yesterday and auctioned at the Pawn Industry Association under the supervision of the County Chamber of Commerce, the Sijing District Office of the Chamber of Commerce, and members of the County Government. The jewelry was won by Rifeng and Defeng Silver Shops, and the cloth clothing was won by Xiangtai.</p>

<h3>Detailed Account of Water Police Repelling Lake Bandits</h3>
<p>Lin Guoliang, the temporary commander of the Taihu bandit suppression, opened fire on bandits at Nanku Xinkai Road, across from Hengjing Maoqi Port, at 11:00 AM on the 4th. The fierce battle lasted until around 5:00 PM, when it subsided. At that time, Wang Wusheng, the captain of the 8th Team of the Water Police, patrol officer Huang Renmin, and one hostage were rescued. The details of this have already been reported in yesterday's special telegram section. The details at the time will be recorded again as follows: At about 9:00 AM on the 4th, Commander Gong received a report that more than 300 lake bandits were gathering on more than 30 boats in the Nanku Xinkai Road area, planning to flee to Zhejiang Province. After receiving the report, Gong immediately ordered the distribution of each team to pre-deploy defense lines and design encirclement and suppression. The 6th and 10th teams of the Second District Water Police blocked Tingzi Port, the 7th team was stationed in Hengjing, the 8th team guarded Dongshan, the 15th team of the Third District and the guerrilla team were stationed in Caogang, the 12th team guarded the Yangcheng Lake pass, and the 13th team was stationed at the Changshu Guanpu estuary to block pirates from entering the country. Commander Gong himself led the 11th and 14th teams to advance on the central road. Once all arrangements were in place, he ordered the 14th Team Leader Huai Zongbang, the 15th Team Leader Lu Shangzhong, and the guerrilla team leader Fang to carry out a three-way encirclement. At about 11:00 AM, the bandits were already surrounded. Gong led the 11th Team from the central road to the destination and ordered them to fire on the bandits. The bandit leaders ordered the members to fight back, and the fierce battle lasted for six hours. At about 5:30 PM, the bandits were overwhelmed and fled. In this battle, two bandit ships were shot down and the hostage, the son of Wang Wusheng, the captain of the 8th Team, patrol officer Huang Wangmin, and Chen Huimin, the head of the Dongshan Security Corps, were rescued. Three bandits were captured and one banner of the bandit was shot down, with the words "Jiangsu-Zhejiang Taihu Guerrilla Team of the Navy, Army, and Air Force" written on it, and a large character "Woman" in the center. A number of firearms and more than ten bandits were killed or wounded. After the lake bandits fled, one road fled to Yichangxing and one road fled to Yanmu. Seeing that the bandits had escaped, Commander Gong rescued the hostages and arrived at Hengjing that night to contact local people and convened the 11th Team Leader Xu Boying, the 14th Team Leader Huai Zongbang, the 15th Team Leader Lu Shangzhong, the 7th Team Leader Li Jianxun, and the guerrilla team leader Fang to plan the second step of the encirclement and suppression. He still ordered each team to block the key passes and telegraphed the district office. Moreover, the gentry of Dongshan and Hengjing met with Commander Gong yesterday morning, stating that Captain Wang Wusheng was already out of danger, but there were still 27 hostages who had not been rescued. They requested that Commander Gong actively rescue the other hostages. In addition to comforting them, Commander Gong also promised to do his best to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Re-examination of Death-Uncertain Lawsuit Scheduled</h3>
<p>The case of the death of Han Jinshi, the daughter-in-law of Han Gunong in Gejialong, Guomen Nei, was reported in February of this year by her relatives Han Guoduo and Han Guolin, who claimed that Han Jinshi's death was planned by the treacherous servant Shi Junqing and Chen Lishi. The prosecutor's office of the District Court exhumed the body and examined the bones. As Han Jinshi had no evidence of wrongdoing, Han Guoduo and Han Guolin were sentenced to imprisonment for the crime of attempting to extort money, and Shi Junqing and Chen Lishi were released without charge. Han Guoduo and his brothers expressed dissatisfaction and appealed to the High Court. The High Court approved the appeal and scheduled a hearing for 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>Accelerated Construction of Huanhu Avenue</h3>
<p>The Jiang-Zhejiang Provincial Governments initiated the construction of the Huanhu Avenue. The Construction Department sent personnel to Wuxi to survey and decided to build the Huanhu Avenue from Xucang in this county along the shore of Taihu Lake directly to Yixing. Recently, Construction Department Director Sun sent the highway bureau survey team leader Sun Baoqin, a local, with more than ten team members by car to Wuxi from the province yesterday afternoon to remeasure the route in order to promote the realization of the road.</p>
<h3>Suspect Arrested in Gun Loss Case</h3>
<p>At the township of Shiqiwan, District 16 of the county, a rice sale was held on the 4th, and buyers were very crowded. The local merchant corps sent members to maintain order. A member of the corps placed a Mauser pistol in his pocket and hung it on the wall during lunchtime. When he went to retrieve it after the meal, the gun and clothing were gone. He immediately searched around and arrested Tang, a suspect, in Qianzhou township, District 15, and recovered five bullets, which were indeed bullets for the gun. However, the gun has not been recovered and is still being investigated.</p>
<h3>Chen Lunkuai Transferred to County for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Chen Lunkuai, a resident of Anzhen, Huaixia Township, District 8, was re-arrested and transferred to the bureau for interrogation. Xie Weikang, a communist suspect, was also arrested. It is heard that Xie is a native of Zhenjiang who lives in Anzhen and runs a teahouse, and Chen Lunkuai often visits him. The reason for Chen's re-arrest is that Chen was wanted for communist activities in this county. When Chen was arrested and sent to the court in Rugao, the High Court found that Chen had not committed a crime in Rugao, but did not revoke the local files for verification, so he was acquitted and released. Recently, Chen returned to Wuxi and was secretly ordered by County Magistrate Sun to have Chen arrested and investigated by the Anzhen Public Security 16th Branch Bureau. Yesterday, Public Security Bureau Chief Xu presented Chen and Xie to the county government. Tang Yiqin, a member of the backlog clearance committee, opened a court hearing. Chen Lunkuai's confession was vague. Xie Weikang confessed that he had not joined the Communist Party. At the end of the interrogation, Chen Lunkuai was ordered to be transferred to the Jiangsu High Court for interrogation, and Xie Weikang was temporarily detained for investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Pays Attention to Local Security</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government's bandit suppression measures have recently shown signs of progress, and the organization of an eight-county joint defense has also been planned. As for the bandit problems in the Huaihai area, the provincial government has planned for the bandit suppression methods in detail because the area is remote and beyond reach. The source of the bandits in the area is probably due to the people's difficult living conditions, and the coastal fishing industry has recently failed, resulting in more and more fishermen becoming thieves. In view of this, the provincial government is planning for fishermen relief methods and formulating various fishing industry protection regulations to prevent the failure of the fishing industry, fundamentally prevent fishermen from becoming pirates, and avoid increasing the strength of other bandits. On the one hand, the Security Department will concentrate its forces to do its best to suppress the bandits. Regarding the communist bandit problem in Jiangnan, the provincial government has ordered that they be jointly and severely suppressed for the sake of stabilizing the defense in response to the Xiang-Gui bandit riots and the lurking rebellion in various places.</p>
<h3>Disputes over Public Property in Four Counties</h3>
<p>The test site of Liyang County, which is public property of four counties including Jintan, Danyang, and Zhenjiang, was previously seized by local ruffian Wang Zhenchen. Representatives from the four counties held a meeting to investigate and requested the Department of Civil Affairs to allocate all the property as a fund for education and relief institutions. This was already approved by the provincial government meeting. Yesterday, another meeting was held at the county party headquarters to discuss countermeasures. The representatives resolved the following measures: (1) State the reasons why the public property belongs to the four counties, and submit them separately to the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, requesting reconsideration and revocation of the original proposal to establish public undertakings for the four counties. The petition will be drafted by the representative of Danyang County. (2) Each county will send one representative to the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters to make representations.</p>

<h3>The Department of Education's Attitude Towards the County's Education Budget</h3>
<p>Most of the teachers and staff in the urban area of this county believe that the budget for the 19th year compiled by the county's Bureau of Education is not satisfactory, so there was a collective resignation some days ago. However, after receiving the budget, the department believed that it exceeded the standard too much and was inconvenient to accommodate. Yesterday, a section of the department sent a letter to Director Chen, inviting him to go to the province for a face-to-face discussion. It is said that Director Chen plans to cross the river early tomorrow (the 5th).</p>
<h3>Inspection Office Arrests Suspicious Passengers</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 3rd) at 3:00 AM, the patrol team of the joint military and police inspection office of this city arrested a guest named Jiang in Room 7 of the Luyang Inn on Xinsheng Street. Jiang claimed to be a staff member of the Confidential Office of the Xu, Huai, and Hai Guerrilla Headquarters. The team asked him what his mission was in Yangzhou. He said that he was going to Xiannv Town to guard the funds of You, and to handle the slaughter tax of this county. He also claimed to know Shao Yaoqing, who is currently a slaughter tax official. Shao lives in Beixiaojie in this city. The team then went to arrest Shao and took him to the office together. Less than two hours later, another Jiang, who also claimed to be an adjutant of the Guerrilla Headquarters, came. He had gone out for business, and when he returned, he learned that the former had been arrested. He took a car to the inspection office to inquire and was also detained. The inspection office has now telegraphed the Guerrilla Headquarters to inquire about the truth, and a decision will be made after receiving a reply.</p>

<h3>Frequent Bandit Cases, Plan to Add Police Squad</h3>
<p>The county government meeting was held yesterday and decided on important cases. Due to the frequent bandit cases in the county and the weakness of the current forces, it is proposed to add a temporary police squad to strengthen defense. It was decided that the police squad should be established immediately in view of the actual needs. However, the annual cost of the squad is about 7,500 yuan, which cannot be raised for the time being. It is proposed to request the province to allow the temporary borrowing from the agricultural mu tax for improvement, and then raise funds to compensate. As for the firearms, the Finance Bureau was ordered to raise an additional 1,000 yuan in accordance with the previous county government resolution for the purchase.</p>
<h3>Using Labor Unrest to Commit Crimes, Sent to High Court</h3>
<p>The workers Ren Ruisheng and Li Junsan, who were involved in the case of using the May 30th yarn factory labor unrest to commit crimes, were interrogated repeatedly. Because of their involvement in reactionary relations, they were escorted to the Suzhou High Court on the 5th by police officer Chen for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Half a Day of Disturbances, Fortunately Calmed Down</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, eight or nine gangsters speaking Hakka dialect were arguing with the guards at the county government site. They then went to the Taidong and Jiaotong hotels outside the north gate to cause trouble. The joint military and police inspection team went to stop them, but a box cannon and bullets were snatched, and the squad leader was injured in the head with a bowl. Several of the rioters fired the snatched box cannon along the road from Zhongshan Gate, causing chaos in the Dongda Street area. A large team of military and police rushed to the scene, and the rioters took rickshaws to the south gate. Another large team of military and police surrounded the south gate and recovered the stolen gun, capturing four rioters. The detective team captured four people on Xida Street, and County Magistrate Li captured four people in Nan Suo Lane and other places. All were taken to the Gendarmerie Company Inspection Office. Local agencies and Commander Yang of the fortress telegraphed their superiors to handle the matter. During the disturbance, Dongda Street and the front of the county government were under special guard, and traffic was cut off. The situation was tense until about 6:00 PM, when the guards were lifted.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Robbery in Yu Hui Town</h3>
<p>It is said that in Yu Hui Town, which belongs to this county, more than 30 bandit ships sailed in from the eastern countryside at noon yesterday (the 3rd). Some refugees and vagrants mixed in and robbed by force, extorting 1,800 yuan. The local people could not cope and only raised 400 yuan. The bandits were dissatisfied and threatened to rob the whole town. According to reports from the escapees, the 8th Squadron of the water police has gone to intercept and suppress the bandits, who have already sailed southwest. The 7th Squadron has sent a team to assist in the suppression. Xitang and Fengjing, which are nearby, have been properly guarded.</p>
<h3>Arrested Bandits Escorted to the County for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Yao Zhuang Bridge Town Security Corps of Shan County arrested two bandits, Zhang Er and Shen Lanchun, during a midnight patrol some days ago. They were immediately escorted to the county government, where they were interrogated by County Magistrate Liang before being transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Ting Wu Accusation Case Transferred to Hangzhou for Trial</h3>

<h3>Robbery Case in Yanjiacun</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, four bandits scaled the wall of Yan Shaoji's house in Yanjiacun, Maiqiao, in the western countryside of Yin County. Lin Agen, the housekeeper of the Yan family, noticed them and escaped through the back door to sound the alarm. The villagers took up farm tools and searched everywhere. At this time, the sky was already dawning, and the bandits fled in panic. Agen chased after one bandit and hit the bandit's foot with a hoe, causing the bandit to fall into the river. The bandit then took out a wooden-cased gun from the water and shot Agen dead. After killing Agen, the bandit saw the villagers standing on both banks and knew that it was difficult to escape. He also drowned. The bandit was about 24 or 25 years old, wearing a black jacket and trousers, with a wooden gun hanging in front of his chest, a knife, and a small knife. There were 12 yuan in silver dollars and some cents in the pocket of the jacket. There were no wounds on the body. The public security branch reported the case to the court for inspection. The remaining bandits all escaped.</p>
<h3>Director of Finance Bureau Resigns Again</h3>

<h3>A Sudden Search for Firearms</h3>
<p>Some days ago, eight or nine people who looked like soldiers and carried long guns suddenly came to the home of Lian Yanchen in Shanghutou, Songxia. Led by a person wearing a gray military uniform, they searched all the rooms upstairs and downstairs. Then, when they heard the sound of gongs in the village, the leader ordered his accomplices to raise their guns and ammunition and spread out in various places to defend themselves. Then, they forced Cao Mengshan, a resident of Zhanghu Bridge, to act as a guide and took the whole team to the Yangshan boat they had parked in advance before releasing Cao. Afterwards, the villagers speculated that Lian Yanchen had always been law-abiding, so where did the firearms come from? Some said that Lian's sister, Qian Chen (the owner of Ma Zhu Cai Zhang), had once come to her uncle's house. The person in military uniform was actually a disguised kidnapper who hoped to use this as an excuse to kidnap Chen for ransom.</p>
<h3>Robbery at the Home of Zhang Xiaxu</h3>
<p>At about 9:00 PM the night before last, more than ten robbers broke into the home of the late Zhang Xiaxu in Zhang Lu Village, Songxia, by breaking through a wall. They climbed upstairs and robbed the family, losing a total of two or three hundred yuan. Zhang had two sons, who had all taken their families elsewhere for business. Only the old, weak, women, and children were left in the house.</p>

<h3>Graduation of the Second Class of the Index Practice Institute</h3>
<p>The Commercial Press strongly advocates student vacation services. This year, it specially used the summer vacation to open the Four-Corner Indexing Method Index Practice Institute. The details of the first and second classes have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday (5th), the second class held a graduation ceremony. The attendees were Li Bake, Manager of the Press, Xiao Fang, Chief of the Confidential Section, Zhuang Baiyu, Yang Ji, Director of the Institute, He Bocheng, Li Bojia, Publishing Minister, Xu Baode, Lin Baohui, Chen Zixin, Cao Yikong, Mao Songgan, Zhao Jingyuan, Zong Youze, Cai Lufu and more than 200 interns. The chairman was Li Bake, the master of ceremonies was Zhao Jingyuan, and the recorder was Zong Youze. The ceremony was as follows: First, the chairman, Li Bake, delivered the opening speech and presented awards. Then, Director He Bocheng reported the interns' performance. Zhuang Baiyu gave a speech, and Li Bojia gave a farewell speech on behalf of the instructors. After refreshments, the meeting adjourned. The first class of the institute had 205 interns representing 103 schools, and the second class had 172 interns representing 104 schools. The two classes had a total of 377 interns representing 209 schools. According to the location of the interns' schools, there were a total of 14 provinces. It is said that the interns' indexing performance this time was excellent, and the speed of the four-corner indexing also broke the highest record of the previous sessions. In 1928, the fastest time to index a character was 2 seconds. This year, the fastest time for the first class was 10.4 seconds, and the fastest time for the second class was 8.9 seconds on average.

<h3>The Hong Kong Chinese Nanyang Football Team Will Depart</h3>
<p>Departure Early This Month / Return to Hong Kong in Mid-September</p>
<p>First to Saigon, Annam / Then to the Nanyang Islands</p>
<p>A Group of Twenty-Two / Led by Mr. Ye Jiugao</p>
<p>(July 31st, Hong Kong Dispatch) The Chinese Sports Association Football Team is famous and admired, and the people of the country have bestowed upon it the nickname "Tiger Team" because of its unassailable prowess. Since the end of the official football tournament in the spring, recognizing the long-standing admiration of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang for the team, it is planning to take this opportunity to send a team to tour Nanyang, to meet with the overseas Chinese on the green football fields, and to promote the development of sports. This is the reason for their intention. Since the South China Football Team accepted the invitation of the Singapore Chinese Sports Association to send a team to the south a month ago, Chinese football had originally wanted to follow suit, not allowing South China to be solely beautiful at the forefront. After the news spread, people in Hong Kong paid great attention to it, because South China going first and Chinese football following suit was not only an unprecedented feat, but also admired the good fortune of the people there. However, the team was unable to proceed due to various reasons at the time, and it was inconvenient to announce whether or not it would happen, so as not to allow the outside world to speculate. The reporter has repeatedly reported on the news of the team's southern tour based on dispatches from Singapore, but there have been doubts, and there have even been rumors that it will not happen. This is because Chinese football had not made a definite statement on this matter at the time, which caused people to have doubts. However, in recent days, the news of the team's revival for the southern expedition has been very clamorous. The reporter, considering the importance of the matter and the eagerness of all parties to understand, specifically inquired with the person in charge of the association, who said that this matter has been a long-cherished wish, and that it was not convenient to announce it earlier because the preparations for various matters were not yet ready. Now, after the committee has further discussed this matter, it has been decided to send a team to tour the south, and the first leg has been set for August 12th. If so, the opportunity for the team to meet with the overseas Chinese in Nanyang is not far away.</p>
<h3>Meaning of the Name</h3>
<p>The Chinese Sports Association originally planned to only send a team to Singapore, so the name originally planned was also only the Singapore Football Team. Now, the committee members believe that the purpose of sending a team to tour the south this time is to seek the study of football skills, so that in the next ordinary trophy football competition, they can win the championship for the fourth time and create a new record. (Chinese football has won the ordinary trophy for three consecutive times, which is already a new record.) It has been found that there are many football masters hidden in the southern islands, not just limited to Singapore, so taking advantage of this southern tour, they will also travel to other ports. Therefore, the name had to be changed. Last night, it was decided to change it to the Chinese Sports Nanyang Football Team.</p>
<h3>Southern Tour Itinerary</h3>
<p>It is estimated that in addition to agreeing on the name, the committee also decided on other matters regarding the sending of a team to tour the south last night. It was also decided that the southern tour team will depart on the 12th of next month on the French ship D'Artagnan. The route is to first go to Saigon and other ports in Annam, where there may be several matches, and then travel south to the Nanyang area, such as Singapore, Sandakan, Surabaya, and Java. The scheduled period is one month, and they can return to Hong Kong around mid-September to participate in the 1930-1931 ordinary football tournament in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Active Practice</h3>
<p>As for the list of players for the southern tour football team, it has not been announced yet, because some players may not be able to go due to circumstances. The team will consist of about 22 people in total. According to the reporter's investigation last night, the person in charge of the association's football department will send the strongest team to ensure a good performance during the competition. Now that the team is ready to go, they are actively training. It is also said that the leader of the team has been elected by the players, and they all have their eye on Mr. Ye Jiugao. It is found that this year, the Hong Kong teams touring the south will first have the South China Football Team, followed by the Chinese Football Team. In between, there is also the Chinese Expeditionary Team organized by the Shanghai Lehua Sports Association (players from both the South China and Chinese football teams have been selected to participate in the expedition). The overseas Chinese in Nanyang who admire the national football team have this good opportunity, which is an unprecedented event.</p>

<h3>Hurricane Outside Wusongkou Last Night</h3>
<p>Coastal Dikes Were Destroyed</p>
<p>Waves Rushed In</p>
<p>A hurricane suddenly arose outside Wusongkou last night, and it was quite fierce. The coastal dikes of Shitou Sha and Dingxing Sha were destroyed by the turbid waves, causing houses and sheds in the vicinity to collapse and all objects to float in all directions. Men, women, old and young, fled in succession, and the cries were deafening. The tide began to recede at dawn yesterday, but the losses were huge. Yesterday, the public groups of these sands discussed relief measures to reassure the people.</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui, the commander-in-chief of the 15th Route Army, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 5:30 PM on the Fengtian Maru from Qingdao. Accompanying him were Secretary-General Feng Dingcheng, Councilor Qiu Jiecun, Yao Ruilin, and more than a dozen others. A reporter from Guowen News Agency went to the residence to interview Mr. Ma. He was suffering from a headache and abdominal pain due to the heat along the way and had already sought medical treatment. He received the reporter with difficulty. He said that this trip was to inspect the direct troops along the Jiaoji Railway Line. He himself had gone to Gaomi, where Commander-in-Chief Han Xiangfang (Fu Ju) was stationed. The advance troops had already advanced and surrounded Zhucheng. He did not know when he would go to Beijing. On the table was a telegram from the headquarters of the 15th Route Army sent from Yanzhou at 7:00 PM on the 4th, reporting the military situation on the Jinpu Railway Line. Mr. Ma agreed to give a copy to the reporter and said that everything could be known from this. The reporter, thinking that Commander Ma needed to rest, then bid farewell. The original telegram is as follows: (1) No changes on the Longhai and Pinghan lines. (2) The right-wing army of the Jinpu line has arrived in the vicinity of Tai'an. The enemy in the Xiemating area of Ningyang has been defeated and is retreating north. The Central Army is pursuing in the vicinity of Tai'an from Nanyi.

<h3>Three Countries Send More Warships to China</h3>
<p>Recently, the British added two first-class destroyers, No. 7 and No. 59, from Hong Kong to Shanghai. They immediately sailed to Nanjing to prepare to go to Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places if necessary. The United States also increased the number of destroyers sent to Shanghai from Little Luzon by four. The USS Shefferson and USS Panay arrived yesterday, and another ship will be sent to the Yangtze River today. In addition, Japan dispatched the 24th Destroyer Squadron, the Yanagi, Hinoki, Momo, and Kashi ships, from Sasebo, which telegraphed Shanghai yesterday that they had left Japan and would arrive in Shanghai today. One ship, the Atami, has been dispatched to the Daye area, and 300 marines will arrive in Shanghai today. A small team will be sent upstream to protect navigation and foreigners.</p>
<p>Decline in Yangtze River Shipping</p>
<h3>Hunan Goods Returned to Hankou</h3>
<p>Since July 25th, Hunan has not traded goods. Most of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Hunan have been turned back midway. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson received a telegram from Hankou stating that a large batch of goods bound for Changsha was loaded by the Hankou-He wheel on July 25th and brought several large iron barges full of various goods into Hunan to above Yuezhou, then immediately turned back to Hankou and remained on the ship, waiting for the situation in Hunan to stabilize before being transported again.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Goods Are Hit Hard</h3>
<p>The import and export business of the Yangtze River ships of the Shanghai Six Companies has been hit hard recently. All goods above Wuhu have virtually stopped. In the past week, except for sugar and salt, which are occasionally loaded, most of the other miscellaneous goods are being loaded in. In recent days, the British and Japanese giant ships on the Yangtze River line, which could transport more than 10,000 pieces of export goods in half a day, are now only loading more than 1,000 pieces. The decline in business is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>New British Ship Delays Opening</h3>
<p>The Baohe, a Yangtze River oil engine express ship being built by Jardine Matheson at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, is the same size as the Taikoo's new ship Wuhu and is also on the Shanghai-Yichang route. It was originally planned to leave the factory and be launched on the 15th of last month, but due to the current situation, the project has not been completed, so the opening date has been delayed. The comprador has assigned Shi Yuzhang to fill the position, and it is estimated that the ship will be launched and start sailing soon.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Da Zhong Ship Accident</h3>
<p>Location: Fuzhou in Kwantung Bay</p>
<p>Entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Shipyard for Salvage</p>
<p>The Da Zhong ship of Heng'an Company in this port had an accident on the way, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the location of the ship accident is in Fuzhou, not Fuzhou in Fujian Province. The following is a breakdown of the latest information obtained yesterday:</p>
<h3>Location of the Reef</h3>
<p>It has been found that the Da Zhong ship left Zhenjiang for Liaoning Fuzhou on July 26 to load coal to be transported to Shanghai and then unloaded at Jiangyin. The ship encountered a hurricane on the sea after leaving. By July 30, when the ship arrived in Fuzhou in the east, between Murchison Island and Milne Island at 121 degrees 12 minutes east longitude and 39 degrees 06 minutes north latitude, it was hit by a large storm. Around 1:00 AM on the 31st, the ship was hit by wind and waves and ran aground on a hidden reef on the island. The head cabin of the ship was driven by the waves to run aground on the reef stones for 40 feet. Fuzhou is a coast on the Liaodong Peninsula and an important coastal port in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Loss Situation</h3>
<p>The ship owner, Russian Zhou Cang, reported in a telegram that the Da Zhong ship accident was caused by the impact of strong winds, which made it impossible to steer. The front of the ship was blown by the wind onto the hidden reef. The head cabin was in the reef stones. The middle cabin and stern were not yet in the reef, so the front of the ship was about 40 feet under water during high tide, and the stern could still float 19 feet above the water. However, the front water cabin and the bottom of the steering platform were broken and leaking water into the ship. Most importantly, the bottom of the ship was not leaking, so it was still possible to find a way to rescue it.</p>
<h3>Towing and Rescue Measures</h3>
<p>After Heng'an Company received the ship owner's report, it telegraphed the Dalian branch to discuss salvage plans with the South Manchuria Railway Company Shipyard. According to a telegram yesterday, the South Manchuria Railway Company Shipyard sent experienced ship masters to the accident site to survey and said that salvage was possible. The company telegraphed back to order them to salvage as soon as possible. All personnel from the ship owner and below remained on the ship to assist in the rescue. The South Manchuria Railway Company has sent engineers and water ghosts to Murchison Island to begin work. The daily towing and rescue fee is set at 750 yuan. According to the Shanghai Xing reporter, the Da Zhong ship has a net tonnage of 2,300 tons. This time, it was an empty ship accident and had not yet loaded coal, so it is hoped that it can be rescued.</p>
<h3>Japanese Committee Member Replaced in the Sino-Japanese Nanjing Incident</h3>
<p>Shimada Takes Over</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Nanjing Incident Investigation Committee has been investigating the losses of the Nanjing Incident. Because the Japanese side's demands were not supported by any evidence, it has not been resolved so far. The Japanese committee members handling this case were Consul Shimizu and lawyer Murakami. Now, Consul Shimizu has been ordered to be dismissed and has returned to his country. The Japanese committee vacancy has been officially announced by Consul General Shigemitsu yesterday, appointing Shimada, the deputy consul of the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing, to take over. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reference, Committee Member Shimada has already come to Shanghai to receive the case files in preparation for continuing negotiations and resolving the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Finance Bureau Discussed the Distribution Method of Collection Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the allocation of collection fees, such as Mangcao, to be used as funds for township offices. The meeting was attended by the district chiefs of the six districts of the county, Wu Jingqing, Peng Liren, Yang Fulin, Bi Huan, Ge Xiusheng, and Wang Chengyao, as well as Shen Zhou, the deputy director of the Property Management Office, and Zhang Pengfei, the chief of the general affairs section of the bureau, and Lu Dingxin, the chief of the collection section, totaling more than ten people. Bureau Chief Wang Li (Zhang</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Pengfei acted as chairman). Tao Chungu recorded the minutes. After the meeting began with customary formalities, the case was discussed in detail, and the following was resolved: the collection fees should be fully public, with actual expenses and actual sales. If there is a surplus, all of it will be allocated to township offices. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Denial by the Anti-Smoking Association Regarding Opium Export from China</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Inquiry to Various Departments for Investigation and Reply</p>
<p>The Central Anti-Smoking Committee, based on a report in the July 16th edition of the "North-China Daily News," stated that a large amount of opium had recently been transported to India. The Indian government had specially dispatched three commissioners to China and Japan to investigate. It was claimed that the opium was manufactured in Japan, with China serving as the central point for transshipment. The committee, considering that if the report was accurate, the harm to China would be immense, regardless of whether it was true or not, believed it had a duty to thoroughly investigate and clarify the situation. It was learned that the committee yesterday specially consulted the Ministry of Finance, ordering all customs houses to strictly investigate and seize, and consulted the provincial governments of Guangdong, Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu to conduct thorough investigations. It also consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send letters to the authorities of various concessions along the coast for a reply.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong Donates a Large Sum for Famine Relief in Qufu</h3>
<p>Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi, upon seeing the appeal for donations for famine relief in Qufu published by the Relief Committee, specially donated 2,000 yuan. Zhao Jinqing delivered the donation by letter to the Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road. Mr. Zhao's original letter stated (omitted above): When Yonggong celebrated his crystal wedding anniversary last year, he received generous gifts from relatives and friends and intended to prepare a feast to express his gratitude. However, due to the unstable situation, this was delayed. Now, considering the famine situation in Qufu, he is allocating 2,000 yuan of national currency, originally intended for repayment, to be used for famine relief, thereby fulfilling his duty and benefiting all relatives and friends.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Wusong and Baoshan Authorities Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the authorities of Wusong and Baoshan specially held a joint meeting at the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. Those in attendance included Yu Zhen of the Fifth Division Supplementary Regiment, Dong Mengyi and Zheng Dong, members of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, Tang Chengzong, a municipal councilor, Zhang Hangong, the district police chief, Yin Gong of the district party committee, Gu Weizhang of the Seventh District Party Committee, Zhang Jiguang and Dai Guosheng of the Seventh Public Security District, Li Huchen, the head of the anti-smuggling brigade, Ding Fan, the head of the water patrol, Shen Jing, the head of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Jingshi, a standing committee member of the county party headquarters, totaling over twenty people. Yu Xia was elected as chairman. Representatives reported on recent developments, and then they began discussing the case on the 3rd of this month, where Director Yang of the Seventh Public Security District, due to the fact that the Hai Bin Hotel in Paotai Bay had tourists inside playing mahjong, suddenly dispatched a large armed police force to surround the hotel, causing panic among the residents. It was resolved that Director Yang had made a mountain out of a molehill and that his actions were inappropriate. The chairman would send a letter of warning. Regarding the case of water police colluding with bandits to rob Dingxing sand and stone boats outside Wusongkou and kidnap people for ransom, it was resolved to request the Garrison Headquarters to send a team to join the water police in searching for the bandits and attempting to rescue the kidnapped victims.</p>
<h3>Record of the Mass Meeting of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union</h3>
<p>Resolved to Elect Eight Representatives</p>
<p>To Negotiate with Factory Management This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union held a general strike rally at the Public Sports Field. Over one thousand workers attended, with representatives from various unions. The city party headquarters specially sent Zhang Yunqing to provide guidance. The Public Security Bureau sent Inspector Gao from the Second District with police officers to maintain order. The key resolutions passed at the meeting and the declaration against the French Concession Police's unwarranted arrest of striking committee members are detailed below.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Xu Amei reported with great sorrow on the events of the strike in recent days. He then reported that the arrest of strike committee member Wang A'gen was a plot by the French imperialist capitalists to completely trap and harm the leaders of our striking workers so that our strike force would disappear. Since they have already arrested Wang A'gen, they certainly want to arrest all of our striking committee members. We must know that the more severely our strike struggle spirit is suppressed, the more fiercely we will struggle. It is hoped that all striking workers will work harder and fight desperately to achieve our ultimate goal. Subsequently, Zhang Amao, Chen Puai, and others gave speeches that were extremely tragic and indignant, and the atmosphere of the strike was extremely tense.</p>
<h3>Key Resolutions</h3>
<p>The chairman proposed a motion for the masses to discuss, and it was immediately resolved to send eight representatives, including Chen Puai, to the company this morning to directly inquire about the conditions and negotiate a solution to the strike to avoid the risk of labor and management not speaking face to face.</p>
<h3>Declaration Issued</h3>
<p>The assembly immediately passed a declaration against the French Concession Police's unwarranted arrest of strike committee member Wang A'gen and others (omitted above). Yesterday (the 4th), strike committee member Wang A'gen and worker Su Jianliang were walking along Route Lafayette, standing by the roadside resting, when a large number of detectives suddenly surrounded them with great force, searching their persons but finding nothing. They then accused them of being rioters, and then accused them of conspiring with others in whispers and arrested them. Who are the other people, and what are they conspiring about? How can the words "whispering" be used to falsely accuse and point them out as rioters? The capitalists' conspiracies and vicious plans to arrest our workers without cause are not only completely exposed but also use the three words "perhaps it is" to frame the workers. How can all our striking workers, while still breathing, allow others to be falsely accused? We can only vow to oppose it and ask all sectors of society to uphold justice. We are now shouting slogans: (1) Oppose the French Concession Police's unwarranted arrest of workers! Oppose the capitalists' conspiracy to frame them! (1) Oppose the French imperialist capitalists bribing the police to wantonly persecute them! (1) Oppose the French Concession Police falsely accusing Wang A'gen and Su Jianliang of being rioters! (1) Oppose the French Concession Police creating unwarranted miscarriages of justice! (1) All striking workers unite to oppose it! (1) We will never give up until the arrested workers are released!</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Schedules Meeting to Discuss Telephone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Director Wu of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau sent an official letter to the district chiefs of the first, second, third, and sixth districts of Puxi in the county, stating: "Regarding the establishment of long-distance telephone lines within the county, the county government meeting previously approved and instructed this bureau to plan and implement the project. Currently, the section in Beiqiao has been fully equipped, and the section in Tangbei is also under planning. However, partial implementation takes a long time and costs more. Both economy and time are wasted. It is neither a quick solution nor a way to comprehensively plan the overall situation. Moreover, only communication between sections is possible, and it is not possible to communicate with the city of Shanghai, so its effectiveness is quite limited. This bureau, seeing this, has consulted with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and reached an agreement that after the establishment of telephone lines in each district of Puxi is completed, they will be allowed to connect for mutual benefit. This matter is of great importance to the construction of each district, so a special letter is sent to invite you to come to this bureau at 2:00 PM on the 8th of this month to discuss the implementation."</p>
<h3>National Anti-Smuggling Conference</h3>
<p>The National Anti-Smuggling Conference was still reviewing motions at the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, the third morning at 9:00 AM. From 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the official meeting was held, and over forty proposals were passed. After the discussions are completed, the conference can be closed on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Results of the Examination for Verification Staff by the City Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters Training Department's preliminary examination for verification staff trainees sent to the training institute was held on the 3rd of this month. The examination covered four subjects: Party Principles, Education, Mathematics, and Chinese. The examination papers were graded on the 4th, and Hou Jiahe and Xia Huan were admitted. Once the procedures are completed, a letter will be prepared to send them to the Central Committee for review.</p>
<h3>City Propaganda Department Propaganda Meeting</h3>
<p>The Fourteenth Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters Propaganda Department held its fourteenth city propaganda meeting at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. Those in attendance included Chen Dezheng and Xu Xingchu of the city propaganda department, and Huang Xianggu, Shen Ding, Shen Yu, Feng Xiancheng, Diao Qingen, Wu Xiqin, and over ten other district propaganda committee members. Department head Chen Dezheng presided over the meeting, with Zhou Hanmei taking notes. The meeting began with the usual formalities. First, the chairman reported, stating: "Today is the fourteenth city propaganda meeting. There are several matters to inform comrades of. First, the weather has been unusually hot recently, but the work of the city propaganda department is even more tense than the climate and cannot be relaxed. Currently, the department's efforts are focused on propaganda against the rebel, Wang Jingwei. Wang Jingwei followed our party leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in the revolution for nearly twenty years. Thanks to Dr. Sun's constant instructions, he avoided falling into error. Comrades in our party praised him for his promising youth and hoped that he would benefit the party and the country and not disappoint Dr. Sun's earnest teaching. Who knew that after Dr. Sun's death, he would act as the leader, first colluding with his party and attempting to sell out our party, which Dr. Sun had painstakingly built, and then colluding with rebels Zhang Fakui and Tang Shengzhi, causing the tragic changes in Guangzhou and Hubei. While the pain of our people has not yet healed, Wang Jingwei not only did not close his door and reflect deeply but instead intensified his actions, colluding with warlord Feng, the Western Hills Conference faction, and the Communications Clique and Anfu Clique, and even colluding with warlords Qi Xieyuan and Sun Chuanfang, whom our party had already overthrown, creating a corrupt and evil group to overthrow the party and the country and reenact the warlord rule before 1926. Our party's Central Committee, upholding Dr. Sun's teachings and bearing the heavy responsibility of building, governing, and saving the country, should combine revolutionary force with the force of the people to directly attack the reactionary forces' lair and eliminate the heads of the traitors who harm the country. Over the past few months, the reactionary forces' strength has been almost completely destroyed, and their day of demise is not far off. However, the crimes of their betrayal of the party, harming the country, and harming the people should still be vigorously propagandized and exposed to the people of the entire country. Therefore, how to expand the propaganda against the rebels needs to be discussed in detail today. Second, the communist bandits in various places have become increasingly rampant. They previously captured Jingdezhen and recently captured Changsha. Although both have been recaptured, the pain suffered by the people is needless to say. Under the party's rule today, the more suffering the people have, the more responsibility our party has. In view of this, the guilt of our party comrades is deep, and how should our party comrades intensify their work to comfort Dr. Sun in the afterlife and save our people from misery? Subsequently, the district propaganda members successively reported on recent work. Then they began discussing (1) how to expand the propaganda against the rebels. It was resolved that (1) the City Propaganda Department should be requested to print a large number of posters and slogans and distribute them to party headquarters at all levels for posting, (2) the City Propaganda Department should be requested to publish special issues on propaganda against the rebels in Party Voice and Times, (3) the City Propaganda Department should be requested to order all districts to publish special issues on propaganda against the rebels in their regular publications, (4) the City Propaganda Department should be requested to hold an expanded memorial week next Monday to report on the latest situation in the fight against the rebels, and (5) the City Propaganda Department should be requested to order permanent propaganda teams in all districts to go out and spread propaganda. (2) The plan to improve the city's speech meetings was finalized. It was resolved to revise and approve it (the resolutions are very long, omitted here). The meeting was adjourned."</p>

<h3>Sixth Anniversary of the National Anti-Drug Society</h3>
<p>Declaration Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Anti-Drug Society of China was founded on August 5, 1924, by over thirty public organizations from all walks of life in Shanghai. It has reached its sixth anniversary. Its years of struggle have been praised by people at home and abroad. Today, on the sixth anniversary of the society's founding, it has issued the following declaration: "Our country has suffered from the harm of opium for over a century. Those with knowledge all know that the harm of opium is sufficient to destroy the country and exterminate the race. It is more than just ruining oneself and destroying one's family. Over the years, repeated foreign defeats, the decline of national reputation, the poverty of people's livelihoods, and the encroachment of famine, and even the daily deterioration of public morals and the collapse of social customs, are all directly proportional to the harm of opium. The harm of opium deeply penetrates society and is closely related to the survival of the nation. Without combining the strength of the whole people to carry out an eradication movement, there is no way to save this endangered national destiny. The National Anti-Drug Society of China was born to shoulder this arduous mission, advocating a drug-resistance and nation-saving movement from the position of pure civilians, with the sole purpose of eliminating opium seedlings at home and stopping the import of drugs from abroad. Its working strategy is to use propaganda and education as the vanguard and promote smoking cessation as relief, hoping to create a strong public opinion with the public's consensus, internally to urge the government to implement prohibitive laws, and externally to use national diplomacy to connect with sympathetic groups in various countries to jointly limit the world's drug production. Scientific and medicinal uses are considered a long-term plan to address the root causes. Based on this scope, we have been working hard, with no political colors or factional effects, and without taking advantage of opportunities to seek anything. Since its establishment, we have been diligent and self-disciplined for six years, as if it were just one day. The people of the country are observing us. Colleagues are always vigilant, as if walking on thin ice, so as not to fail the public's trust and violate the purpose of eradicating opium. However, the devil is one foot taller than the Tao, which is true in ancient times and even more so today. Today, the scourge of drugs is rampant, increasing rather than decreasing, and the environmental situation is deteriorating day by day. The past achievements of this society, however small, all rely on the support of the people of the country. What we hope for from the people of the country in the future is even more cooperation. However, this society is not a judicial or administrative organ and has no power to enforce prohibition against the planting, transportation, trafficking, and smoking of opium, nor does it have the right to judge and punish. These powers are related to the central and local governments and cannot be overstepped by civil society groups. The Central Anti-Smoking Committee is an administrative organ. People from all sides do not understand the truth and often confuse it with this society. Some people are dissatisfied with the handling of previous opium cases and repeatedly question this society. It must be known that this society has no power and can do nothing. This society has always put forward opinions on the authorities' opium prohibition measures and urged them from the sidelines. Whether the propositions put forward are adopted and implemented depends entirely on the public opinion as a backing. Today, imperialists have not abandoned their opium policy, colonial governments still rely on tobacco taxes as their main source of income, and the remaining warlords and shameless bureaucrats still protect planting and trafficking for their own benefit. As for the local traffickers and opium merchants, they have great power, colluding with treacherous officials and bribing police detectives to do private business. All of these are in front of us. If we do not expand our organization and unite our strength, how can we curb this rampant flow and guide opium prohibition onto the right track? The success of alcohol prohibition in the United States relies entirely on the fifty years of unremitting struggle by people's groups. Our country's opium scourge is even worse than America's alcohol scourge. To achieve final success, it is necessary for the people of the entire country to contribute their spirit and strength to this great movement of humanity. It must be known that our enemies are united and have strong and well-organized organizations. If we do not cooperate, how can we overthrow the other side's power? As the military strategist said, 'Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle.' The anti-drug movement is also the same. This society has been fighting hard for many years and only knows that drug resistance is absolutely non-negotiable. We dare not change this will and have not changed our commitment. Success or failure is not what we care about. From now on, we must continue to uphold the entrustment of the people and work hard. We must ensure that this society exists for one day without changing. Now, on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of this society, and at the beginning of the implementation of the second five-year movement plan, we solemnly publish our vows in this declaration."</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Chinese Institute of Engineers Annual Conference</h3>
<p>The thirteenth annual conference of the Chinese Institute of Engineers has long been decided to be held in Shenyang from August 16th to 22nd. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The preparations for this annual conference are being carried out separately by the annual conference committee, the proposals committee, and the thesis committee. A brief description of the approximate situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3>I. Regarding Proposals</h3>

<h3>Declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Workers' Union Federation</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Workers' Union Federation issued a declaration yesterday, stating: (omitted above) "The state emphasizes upholding legislation, and labor movements are difficult and rely on solidarity. We, the members of the association, are humble and deeply ashamed of our lack of knowledge. The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Workers' Union Federation has been entrusted with a heavy responsibility by the city party headquarters to prepare for this federation. We are deeply afraid of being overwhelmed. At the beginning of this appointment, we are mindful of the future and cannot help but speak out. We respectfully state this to all sectors of society and to our fellow workers in this industry. In recent years, the state-run cigarette industry has been declining due to the impact of the gold standard order and the monopoly of imperialists. This is undeniable. Its decline has affected not only itself, but also directly impacted the livelihoods of our fellow workers in this industry. To seek remedies, the government's awards, promotion, and support are crucial. However, the unchanging guidance from all sectors of society, as well as the survival and prosperity of all our fellow workers, are also the only conditions. It is hoped that we will uphold this spirit, open our hearts, and cooperate with this association to develop the industry together. This is the first priority. If the skin is gone, where can the hair attach? To hope for a temporary exploration will also be futile. As for the mission of this association, its special responsibility is to prepare for the federation, and its core element is to unite the industry and build the foundation for the national revolution. This is something that we, the members of this association, should encourage ourselves with. Our fellow workers in this industry should also strive together with us. We should urgently weigh the rights and interests, resolve doubts, and choose between public and private interests. We should calmly abandon impetuosity and walk the path of prosperity together. We should not hesitate to sacrifice and strive to build the industry. We should take the entire organization as the premise and regard corruption and deterioration as shameful. As for the reorganization and division of existing groups and the organization of workers who have not yet been organized, this is also the sole task of this association. Shanghai is a place where people from all over gather, and traitors are lurking in the concessions, scheming to subvert the government. Although they are just petty clowns, they are irrelevant to the overall plan. However, past events prove that this is a crisis for our labor community. All our fellow workers should firmly adhere to their will, forever not forget, and take the Three People's Principles as a model to build a strong barrier and expect self-improvement. Those who are willing to sabotage or even sell workers as commodities will be condemned and abandoned by all sectors of society. We also wish to abandon them together with all our fellow workers. This declaration is made with sincerity."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Investigates the Total Capital of Various Shops</h3>
<p>In Order to Collect Membership Fees Proportionately</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various industry associations yesterday regarding the collection of membership fees based on the total capital of various shops. The letter stated: "According to Article 30 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the expenses of the Chamber of Commerce are divided into the following two types: (1) Administrative expenses shall be borne by members in proportion to the number of representatives they send and their capital amount. When the former Preparatory Committee for the Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of member representatives on June 21, it drafted a proposal to collect fees in proportion to the amount of capital, which was incorporated into Article 42 of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Constitution. This was discussed, revised, and approved by the member representatives at the meeting on that day and submitted to the Social Bureau for review. Since the use of the amount of capital as the standard for membership fees has already been stipulated in Article 30 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, it is necessary to investigate and clarify the total capital amount of the shops belonging to the group members and the capital amount of the company and shop members in order to provide a basis for collecting fees in proportion to the amount. Special letters are sent to inform you of this. It is hoped that your association will investigate and clarify the approximate total capital amount of the shops under your jurisdiction and reply to this association within two weeks for processing. If you fail to report within the deadline, this association will send personnel to investigate on its own in order to avoid delaying the process. We must first declare that the fees paid before the June 21 meeting of member representatives refer to the membership fees that should be added for each additional representative, which is different from the situation of investigating the amount of capital this time to determine the standard for collecting the basic membership fee that should be charged for sending one representative. If your association only sent one representative at that time, then after the amount of capital is clarified this time, the standard for collecting fees will be determined, and we will calculate whether you should receive a refund or pay an additional fee at that time. We are afraid that you have not examined this in detail and mistakenly think that this investigation is a duplicate collection of fees, so we will explain this in detail. Please also explain this to your association and handle it promptly."</p>

<h3>Litigation Jurisdiction at the Border of the Chinese and Foreign Concessions</h3>
<p>Accusation Against the Star Socks Factory</p>
<p>Rental Concession Number Affixed in Front</p>
<p>Location Within the Chinese Territory</p>
<p>Special District Court Declines Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The Star Socks Factory on North Szechuan Road was originally located in Chinese territory, but the road in front of it belonged to the concession. The factory's number, 482, was also assigned by the Municipal Council. This time, the factory was sued by the Stamp Office for not affixing stamps on invoices in accordance with stamp tax regulations. The Municipal Council notified the Special District Court to prosecute. Previously, its manager, He Zhongwen, was ordered to appear in court to await trial, but He did not appear. When the court opened again yesterday, He surrendered himself and declared that the socks factory was located in Chinese territory and not subject to the Special District Court's jurisdiction. Judge Luo Renji ruled that since the defendant was not under jurisdiction, the case should not be accepted. He then dismissed the charges. The detective lawyer had no objection to this decision. In recent years, there have been disputes between the police and Chinese authorities over jurisdiction in the area where the Chinese and foreign concessions meet on North Szechuan Road. Although these incidents have been short-lived and have not caused major disturbances, the future is long. If fundamental solutions are not found, the aftermath of foreign aggression is a cause for concern. Judge Luo's decision not only clarifies the jurisdiction of litigation but also deeply upholds the spirit of defending the country.</p>
<h3>Over 300,000 Losses Due to Carelessness at Jardine Matheson Warehouse Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Warehouse No. 8 Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Cause of Fire Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Warehouse No. 8 in Pudong's Lan Ni Du suddenly caught fire due to carelessness at around 2:00 AM yesterday, causing losses of approximately 300,000 in goods and the warehouse itself. A detailed investigation is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Fire</h3>
<p>The company is located on the Pudong waterfront of Lan Ni Du, covering an area of over one hundred acres, with four large and small wharves, fourteen warehouses, and several offices for Chinese and Western personnel. Twelve petition police officers and one inspector from the Municipal Police Department's Third District were stationed inside the warehouse to provide protection. Unexpectedly, at 2:35 AM yesterday, Song Yulin, the night patrolman, smelled a burning odor near Warehouse No. 8 on the north side. He then saw thick black smoke coming out of the window seams of the warehouse. Knowing it was a fire, he immediately blew his whistle and reported to Inspector Jiang Jiming, who informed the Jardine Matheson Main Warehouse and used the telephone to alert various firefighting agencies on land and water.</p>
<h3>Glimpse of Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>Soon, the internal burning intensified, and after about half an hour, it broke through the roof. The fire was raging, reaching high into the sky, and a red glow could be seen from afar. At this time, the Public Concession Municipal Council and the Customs Water Patrol Police sent firefighting boats to dock outside the warehouse and connected long hoses to pour water inside to extinguish the fire. By 5:00 AM, the fire gradually weakened, and after a while, the flames were extinguished. However, there were many items destroyed by the fire, which could not be completely extinguished easily. Yesterday morning, thick smoke was still visible, so the firefighting boats continued to work hard to draw water and spray it. Until the afternoon and evening, it had not stopped. Water flowed all over the fire scene inside and outside.</p>
<h3>Embers of Jardine Matheson Warehouse No. 8 (Photo by This Newspaper's Photography Department)</h3>
<h3>Number of Losses</h3>
<p>In this fire, in addition to the complete destruction of the burning Warehouse No. 8, an estimated 8,000 pieces of paper (each worth about eight taels of silver), 3,800 bags of soybeans (each worth about five taels of silver), 3,400 pieces of tea bricks (each worth about fifty taels of silver), 2,250 bags of wheat flour (each worth about two taels and five qian of silver), and three pieces of tobacco leaves were burned. The above goods were stored in the warehouse by various merchants, most of whom had fire insurance. It is reported that the total value of the losses, including the warehouse, is approximately 300,000 gold fire notes.</p>
<h3>Cause Unknown</h3>
<p>The company's warehouses open at 6:00 AM and lock at 5:00 PM every day. They employ warehouse specialists to manage the keys. No one lives in the warehouses, and smoking is prohibited when loading and unloading goods. The prevention is extremely strict, so the cause of the fire is still unknown. It is said that a handyman during the day may have accidentally dropped a cigarette butt into the pile of goods, which gradually burned and, after a long time, became a prairie fire, but this is not certain.</p>
<h3>Police Patrol</h3>
<p>When the fire started, Zhang, the district chief of the Third District of the Pudong Public Security Bureau, reported that strict precautions should be taken within the current martial law period. He immediately joined forces with Zhu, the captain of the Fourth Police Squad, to lead all police officers and distributed them around the warehouse to patrol back and forth to maintain order until dawn when they all returned to their teams.</p>

<h3>Blind Young Woman Sues for Inheritance</h3>
<p>Plaintiff is a Prostitute's Daughter</p>
<p>First Investigate Identity Relationship</p>
<p>Zhang Bao'bin (i.e., Xiang Zhang), a blind young woman, recently hired two lawyers, Liu Hui and Yao Xian, to file a lawsuit against Zhang Yingxin for seizing ancestral property and inheritance, requesting analysis, etc. The petition stated that the late father, Zhang Xiaomei (i.e., the defendant's father), and the late mother, Xie Wenxiu, lived together (the late mother opened a brothel). After the father died in 1921, the defendant recognized the late mother as his adoptive mother. Because the plaintiff was blind, the defendant managed all family affairs. In October 1927, the mother died. The plaintiff sacrificed her blindness for her mother for seventeen years. In March 1928, the plaintiff married Xiang Huaiqing. Unexpectedly, after getting married, the defendant treated her as a stranger. It is found that the late mother's inheritance is about 200,000 gold, and the plaintiff should get 20,000 gold, etc. The defendant, Zhang Yingxin, hired Yan Yinwu as a lawyer to file a defense. Zhang Bao'bin falsely claimed to be the daughter of the late father, embellished the petition, and requested dismissal. He stated that the late father had two sons and two daughters. The plaintiff falsely claimed to be the defendant's sister, hoping to usurp the inheritance. The plaintiff is the daughter of a prostitute and wants to recognize the late father as her father, hoping for something inappropriate. The plaintiff speaks wildly and makes arbitrary fabrications. The plaintiff's husband, Xiang Huaiqing, repeatedly borrowed money from the defendant, but unexpectedly borrowed and did not repay. Therefore, when they refused, they fabricated the story. The facts are there and should be dismissed, etc. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Zhang Jinjian opened the Fifth Court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Zhang Bao'bin, testified that she was 27 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at No. 44 Chengxin Lane, Hongzhen (Q). How do you request (A). Request to distribute the late mother's inheritance (Q). What is the relationship between you and the defendant (A). Brother and sister, but each of the mothers. The former's late mother, Xie Wenxiu, opened a brothel. Father's name is Zhang Xiaomei. My father died when I was nineteen (The defendant's lawyer, Yan Yinwu, stood up and said, "Please note that the plaintiff claims that her mother is a prostitute.") (Q). What is the relationship between your mother and Zhang Xiaomei (A). Because my mother runs a brothel, Xiaomei often comes to visit, so they recognize each other. They live together for more than ten years. Xiaomei is the director in the brothel. My mother does not live in Zhang's house. My mother, Xie Wenxiu, died on September 11, 1927 (Q). Is your mother Xiaomei's mistress or concubine (A). It is a mistress (Q). How much inheritance is there and how much do you want to distribute (A). The inheritance is about 200,000 yuan. I request to analyze 20,000 yuan. Its industry such as the West Gate has more than eleven bungalows such as land and cash gold ornaments (Q). Has the defendant come to your home (A). Yes, he calls my mother "Mom," etc. Next, the defendant, Zhang Yingxin, testified that he was 40 years old, from Ningbo, and lived on Beile Road for exchange business. My father, Zhang Xiaomei, died at the age of 55 and has been dead for ten years. My biological mother is Shi (Q). What do you call the plaintiff's mother (A). I have called him "Mom" since I was a child (Q). When did Xie die (A). He died in 1927 (Q). How many houses are there in total (A). There are four rooms in the front row and three rooms in the back row, all bungalows, and land in Hongzhen, etc., which is not worth the price (Q). You request to analyze the production of the plaintiff. What do you mean (A). He has no reason at all. It is completely fabricated (Q). Do you have relatives (A). Yes, such as aunts and cousins, etc. After the interrogator got the testimony, he instructed the lawyers of both parties that the identity relationship should be studied first in this case. The debate will not be opened today. The hearing will be adjourned to another date. Then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>A Pitiful Prostitute's Life</h3>
<p>Husband Died, Sold into a Brothel by Uncle</p>
<p>Soliciting Customers Every Night, Suffering Unspeakably</p>
<p>At about 8:40 AM yesterday, a young woman with fashionable clothes, about 20 years old, with a cropped haircut, was seen wandering and weeping on the road in Caojiadu Town, Jishiwei Road, West Shanghai. Her expression was very flustered, as if she had great worries. The passers-by stopped and watched. A member of the Fourth Team of the Songhu Security Regiment in the town saw her and immediately questioned her. Her words were vague and abnormal. Because her behavior was suspicious, she was taken back to the team headquarters. After questioning by the team leader, Li Meiqing, the woman claimed to be named Wang Liying, 20 years old, from Tangxi, Zhejiang, and lived at No. 8 Chengdeli, Touji Bridge, Public Concession. She married Chen Yuqing from the same village at the age of 17 through a matchmaker. After marriage, the couple's feelings were very close. Unexpectedly, good things are often ground down. After more than a year and a half, her husband suddenly died of illness. The woman was lost after losing her husband at a young age. She thought about making a living on her own and expressed her intention in conversation with others. Unexpectedly, it was heard by her husband's brother, Maoqing, who took the opportunity to lure the woman, falsely claiming that she could work in Shanghai and live without worry. He had acquaintances to introduce the woman. The woman believed him to be true and entered his trap. In mid-July last year, she came to Shanghai with her husband's brother, Maoqing. After staying in a hotel for a few days, he took the woman to Yuan's house at No. 8 Chengdeli and falsely claimed that she would learn peacefully here. He disappeared. When she saw that there were five or six women in the Yuan's house, she was surprised. The woman (i.e., the procuress) explained to the woman that you have been sold here by your uncle for 300 yuan. This place is a brothel and you must go out at night to receive customers. You must not be lazy, etc. The woman suddenly realized that she had been deceived. Therefore, regardless of sunny or rainy days, she must stand on the road at night to solicit customers and do this flesh-and-blood business. If there is any negligence, she will be whipped by the patrolmen on the outside and abused by the procuress inside all night without sleep. The procuress's abuse is really unspeakable. She wanted to jump out of the fire pit, but the surveillance was so strict that she could not succeed. Because of this, she was depressed and emaciated and her body was skinny and the sores on her lower body were severely inflamed, like suffering in hell. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, she happened to receive a guest surnamed Jin and stayed in Room 24 of the Zhongshan Hotel. Fortunately, the guest got up and left at 6:00 AM. The woman took this opportunity to escape. She was unfamiliar with the road and ran to this place. Her brain was really dizzy. She was grateful to be rescued, etc. After hearing the confession, Team Leader Li thought that the woman was deceived to Shanghai and sold as a prostitute and suffered abuse. Her life was really pitiful. He immediately sent a letter and sent someone to send the woman to the Zhabei Charity Group for support.</p>

<p>Reconciliation Achieved in Court</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Reunited</p>
<p>Wu A'mao, a native of this county, lives in Xin Jiekou, Lan Ni Du, Pudong. He hired Lawyer Qu to file a lawsuit for cohabitation with the local court.

The defendant was originally a woman who became involved in the lawsuit due to a misunderstanding. After the court persuaded her, the suspicion was cleared. Wu Yu was allowed to live in her parents' home for ten days and return home. The defendant must not scold her, and the plaintiff must also abide by the way of women and not quarrel for no reason. Both parties promised without objection and considered the reconciliation established. The lady returned during the Dragon Boat Festival last year to spend time together until July, when she returned to Ning and did not return home. She was invited to return during the Qingming Festival this year, but she did not return. The husband and wife have the obligation to cohabit. The lady admitted that she would return home to spend time together, so how could she repent and never return after the incident? On July 9 this year, she entrusted her lawyer to send a letter agreeing to return home and live together peacefully within five days of receiving the letter. After more than ten days, there was still no news. She had no choice but to file a lawsuit requesting approval to check the original case and order the defendant to cohabit with the plaintiff, etc. The defendant, Wu Yu, also hired Zhu Fang as a lawyer to file a defense. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Zhao Zhenhai opened the Fourth Court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Wu A'mao, testified about the previous situation.

<h3>Jin Sanbao Seduces, Abducts, and Sells</h3>
<p>Zhu Sanyuan Grossly Deceived</p>
<p>Zhu Mao, wife of Zhu Sanyuan, a villager from Zhujiaqiao, near Benniu in the western suburbs of Changzhou, is 29 years old. Though past her prime, she is still attractive, and the couple's relationship is quite harmonious. In the past two years, due to losses in silkworm farming (the western suburbs regard silkworm breeding as an important side business), they have accumulated a large debt, and the couple is constantly worried. A neighbor from the same village, Jin Sanbao, 26 years old, who works as a cook in a Shanghai mansion, returned to the village in May on some business. Seeing Zhu's family constantly harassed by creditors, and Zhu and his wife looking worried, he seized the opportunity and told Zhu that the factories in Shanghai were booming and lacking female workers. He said that if his wife went to Shanghai to work in a silk factory, she could earn a monthly salary of twenty or thirty yuan. If he was interested in his wife working in a factory, he would be able to secure an excellent job for her at the silk factory owned by his boss with a single word. Zhu was moved by his words and discussed it with Mao. Mao had also heard of Shanghai's prosperity and longed to visit, but had no opportunity. Seeing Jin’s willingness to introduce her to a job, she immediately agreed. They made preparations and left with Jin, while Zhu repeatedly entrusted her to Jin's care. On May 21, she traveled to Shanghai with Jin, carrying a bundle of clothes. Jin, however, was unemployed and had no place to live in Shanghai. He and Mao checked into a room at a small hotel on Rue Edouard, telling her that he needed to explain the situation to his boss before she could enter the factory. That night, he used all sorts of seductions, eventually raping her. The next day, Jin left and returned, telling Mao that his boss had gone to Putuo to burn incense and would return in a few days, so she would have to wait a little longer. They spent the room rent and used up all the clothes she had brought. Mao asked Jin daily whether his boss had returned, but Jin always gave excuses and delayed, saying that his boss would not return for a while, and he would have to recommend her to work as a helper in a wealthy family until his boss returned. Mao had no money for daily expenses and wanted to return to the village, but had no travel money, so she had to let him do as he pleased. Jin recommended her to work in a salted meat shop in Zhujiaqiao. In the beginning, the madam treated her well, but did not pay her any wages. Then she forced her to receive guests and engage in prostitution. Mao refused and asked the madam for wages, intending to take a car back to the village. The madam said that Jin Sanbao had pawned her to her, taking 50 yuan and stating that it was for a one-year term. If she wanted to leave, she would have to repay the 50 yuan. Mao was terrified and secretly sent a letter to her husband Zhu at a fortune-telling stall. Zhu came to Shanghai a few days ago and went to the salted meat shop to negotiate with the madam. He learned that he had been deceived by Jin and searched everywhere for Jin, but could not find him. He has now repeatedly pleaded with the madam, who has agreed to allow him to redeem his wife for 25 yuan. Therefore, Zhu has returned to his hometown to raise money to redeem his wife.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Second District to Issue Medical Assistance Certificates</h3>
<p>Peng Liren, the head of the Second District of Shanghai County, recognizing that diseases are prevalent between summer and autumn and that poor people cannot afford medical treatment, urgently needs to find ways to provide relief. The previous system of setting up clinics required fixed dates, preventing timely diagnosis and treatment. Both doctors and patients had to travel long distances to the clinic, which was inconvenient. Therefore, he intends to change to a certificate system. The district office will print medical assistance certificates and issue them to various township offices. Poor patients can go to the nearest township office to obtain a certificate and then consult a doctor at their home. This method is more convenient. He invited all the district doctors to a meeting yesterday to discuss the proposal, and it was unanimously approved. The medical assistance certificates have been sent to Shanghai for printing and will be distributed soon.</p>
<h3>Director Cao Solves a Case and Captures Criminals</h3>

Cao Chengbing, the director of the precinct, immediately led Patrol Leader Liu Qingyun and patrolman Zhang Congsi to investigate. It was verified that the team had been robbed and looted unsuccessfully. After the verification, they returned to the precinct and carefully investigated the route taken by the criminals. Near Chenjiatou, they smelled the odor of opium and traced it to the Wu Gengsheng Teahouse at No. 7. They apprehended one set of smoking paraphernalia and two liang of opium on the spot and confiscated a Browning pistol containing seven rounds of live ammunition. Witnesses were also apprehended and taken to the headquarters for investigation.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item I saw in your esteemed newspaper about the 7th Executive Committee meeting of the National Medical Association, specifically point five of the matters discussed by the association, concerning the Central University Medical College sending Mr. Reiss, a Chinese representative, to attend the International Medical Congress, which concerns the dignity of our country's scholars, and the association urgently needing to express its views. The resolution was to send a letter warning the Central University Medical College, instructing it to consider the national interest, promote academics, and re-appoint a Chinese scholar as a representative. If it is difficult to choose, it is better to be absent. If a foreigner is the representative, the association should send a telegram to the International Medical Congress to deny it, and so on. Upon investigation, Dr. Reiss Luo has always been an associate professor of dermatology at our college. This time, he is going back to his country on leave to participate in the International Dermatology Congress in The Hague in a personal capacity. Our college has not entrusted him with the appointment of a representative, and the association does not have an explicit invitation to send a representative. Our college also has no need to appoint a representative. The various sections discussed by the Executive Committee of the National Medical Association are completely inconsistent with the facts. For the sake of the reputation of our college, in addition to sending a letter to the Medical Association to correct the facts, this is a solemn statement, requesting your esteemed newspaper to publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" section. Thank you very much. Please give my regards to the editor.</p>
<p>National Central University Medical College, August 5th</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Upon reviewing today's (August 5th) local news column in your esteemed newspaper, regarding "Chongsha Shipping's Mediation of Tidal Disputes Breaks Down," the fact that the mediation of this case failed to reach a settlement is indeed true, but other records contain many errors. I am writing to you urgently to request a correction to clarify the situation and show the friendship of the public. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Shipping Association Editorial Department of the Shen Bao, 1985.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in yesterday's newspaper about the German Constitution Day anniversary, which stated that the German Consulate General in this city will hold a commemorative ceremony at the consulate from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 11th of this month, and will host foreign guests from various countries. After investigation, the reception for guests on that day will be from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM, not 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM. This is specially reported and it is hoped that it will be corrected. Respectfully addressed to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao, German Consulate General in Shanghai, August 5th.</p>

<p>Girl—Why do you always walk so far away and don't want to be with me every night when we go out for a walk?</p>

<h3>A Brief Stay at Mogan Mountain (4)</h3>
<p>— Jingbo</p>
<p>The famous scenic spots in the mountains can be visited almost entirely if one plans the itinerary by day. However, climbing the mountains to escape the summer heat should be done with leisure and pleasure. Following where the spirit takes you, taking a leisurely stroll with a walking stick, there is no need to rush to every mountain peak and generate startling sweat. I stayed in the mountains for several days, living quietly in the lodge. The bamboo shadows fill the steps, and the rich greenery pleases the eye. Looking out the window at a corner of the green mountains, this small amount of pure pleasure is enough. The corridor on the upper floor of the railway hotel is very wide. The sofas and other furnishings are neatly arranged. After dinner, I sit for a while, and the mountain breeze blows continuously. The joy is infinite. From the high eastern terrace, I can look down on the mountains as if they are under my feet. The winding road from Sanqiaobu to Yucun is like a long snake, also leisurely in sight. The day after climbing the mountain, mountain rain was about to come. Clouds and fog filled the sky, a vast expanse. The mountains suddenly disappeared. Standing in the precarious building, it was as if I were on a ship sailing rapidly in the vast ocean. After a while, the rain stopped, and white clouds flew like tattered cotton. The mountain scenery also changed unpredictably, sometimes hidden, sometimes visible, sometimes bright, sometimes dim. When the clouds cleared, the bamboo shadows and mountain mist rushed to the eyebrows again. The changes between sunny and rainy days are instantaneous. I sigh at the sight.</p>
<p>Mogan Mountain has ten mountains, such as Pao Tai Mountain, Shangheng Mountain, Yin Mountain, Gangtou Mountain, Gangtou Dun, Zhonghua Mountain, Luhua Dang, Jinjia Mountain, Mantou Mountain, and Ta Mountain. Pao Tai Mountain is the gateway to the mountains via the old road. Shangheng Mountain has a small market. Yin Mountain is the most prosperous place in Mogan Mountain because its terrain is flat and it is located in the center of the mountains, making transportation convenient. Lodges, banks, bookstores, and shops in the mountains are all clustered here. The old church is also in Yin Mountain. Now that the new church is completed, the Westerners have sold the site of the old church to the Shanghai Bank and the Commercial Press. The time for the transfer of the house is next year. This is also a small vicissitude in the mountains.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Strange Tales from Mingguang</h3>
<p>— Jiefei</p>
<p>The Last Life and Death: A Mr. Wang lives a few dozen miles from the town, earning a living as an old gardener. His nephew was studious and hardworking when he was young. When he grew up, he became a monk, wearing straw sandals and carrying a begging bowl, visiting various mountains. Recently, he traveled north to Mount Wutai and returned to visit his uncle. That evening, he fell seriously ill. The uncle hurriedly bought a thin coffin in the market. When the coffin arrived, the monk recovered. The uncle was sick and dying, so he was placed in the coffin.</p>
<p>Airplane Sight Becomes Blindness: Zhang Da Duzi, who lives east of the town and makes a living by gardening, is known to everyone as an old and sincere person. He first came to Mingguang alone and worked hard. Now his children and grandchildren are around his knees, and the onions and chives fill the ridges. Although he is eighty years old, he is still healthy. A few days ago, a national army airplane flew north along the Jinpu Line. In the shadow of the clouds, Zhang Lao's eyes were dim. He stared at the clouds and suddenly fell to the ground and died. It can be said that he was blinded by one sight.</p>
<p>Three Women Give Birth to Eight Children: Near the north street of the town, three women gave birth to eight children one night: two boys and one girl, one two girls and one boy, and one one boy and one girl. The news spread quickly, and women from all over the town formed teams to watch, calling it a miracle.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Ji Ya</p>
<p>If one is on the battlefield, bathed in blood and the stench of war every day, and does not personally go to the front line to witness the situation, how can one know how those with broken arms and pierced chests came to be? Wouldn't that be a great regret? I have had this ambition for a long time, but I have never had the opportunity. I met Zhao Guantao, the commander of the Sixth Division, who wanted to go to the front line to observe the position. The day before, he sent his adjutant, Xu Shipu, to ask if I would like to go. I immediately said yes. The division headquarters was about ten miles away from the front line. Two trucks were taken, one for the officers and one for the guards. They drove quickly in the green gauze tent, and the dust covered the eyes, making it impossible to see the sky. In an instant, the car stopped, and they got out of the car and walked to the regimental headquarters of the 35th Regiment for a short rest, slightly eating melons and plums to relieve the heat. Then they divided into teams to go, because they were afraid that a large group of people would be shelled by the enemy. After walking less than a mile, short walls were arranged horizontally like the Great Wall. Commander Zhao said that this was a defensive work. The wall was built with earth, only as high as a person and about three feet thick. Under the wall was a deep ditch, with an outer trench on the outside and a communication trench on the inside. About ten steps outside the trench, there was barbed wire and two rows of wooden stakes, with the wire wrapped around like a net. At intervals of a few steps between the nets, there was a kerosene bag, and a sentry was assigned to guard it. If the enemy approached, the sentry would light the kerosene bag, illuminating it as if it were daytime, and the guard could use it to aim and shoot. There was an underground room in the ditch for the guards to rest in shifts. It was high enough to stand upright and wide enough to lie down. Wood was erected above to support the earth, level with the ground, so it was not easily invaded by artillery fire. Residents near the front line often imitated this to avoid danger. The side of the village's houses facing the enemy was regarded as a natural fortress, with holes pierced in the walls as gun holes and walls broken to make doors for easy transportation. If the enemy broke through the barbed wire and attacked the outer trench, there were also field bunkers for flanking attacks. The shape of the bunker was like an underground room, with gun holes all around, located between the outer trenches, and could be fired in all directions. With such deep trenches and high walls, even if the attackers suffered great sacrifices, they would not be able to do anything. Ji Hongchang's troops were the elite of Feng's troops, known for their bravery. They had repeatedly launched fierce attacks, but so far almost all of them had been killed or injured. There was even a mutual warning not to invade the Sixth Division's defense zone, and the Sixth Division's strict defense was as solid as ever. While visiting, a bullet came from the enemy and landed without exploding about a hundred steps away from us. The bullet weighed about sixty or seventy pounds. Commander Zhao said that this was a heavy mortar, and its explosive power was very strong. I said that if it had exploded, we would all have been crushed to pieces, and I couldn't help but feel frightened. Before long, the sound of crackling sounded like a string of beads, as if we were the target. A certain company commander's hat brim was suddenly pierced by a bullet, and it almost hit the top of his head. The enemy was less than a mile away from the position. If there were no sorghum stalks to separate them, their movements would be clear to each other, and those nearby could even hear their laughter. According to the sentries, the enemy often used tricks to confuse people, sometimes setting off firecrackers, red and green, in front of the position, or holding large lantern parties inside the defense zone. Sometimes they raised their voices and shouted, "Folks, we have no pay, we are starving and freezing, we really can't stand the hardship. We are willing to surrender." Although their words were sweet, their hearts were very cunning, and they were never moved by them. The Sixth Division's defense zone was almost thirty miles long. What I observed that day was less than one-fifth. Although I didn't get to see the whole picture, I could infer the rest from what I saw. This trip was with Zhao Guantao, Chief of Staff Zhou Bi Yan, 17th Brigade Commander Fan Songfu, 18th Brigade Commander Chen Shiji, and various regimental and battalion commanders of the Sixth Division.</p>
<h3>A New Invention of a Car Trailer</h3>
<p>— Chuan San Cao Tong</p>
<p>The number of cars in the world is increasing every day, and the roads in Zhejiang are the most developed area in China. The yellow sand roads are winding and endless, extending in all directions, almost all over the territory, making transportation extremely convenient. The recently built lines, in addition to the Beijing-Hangzhou Road, such as the Hang-Chang, Hang-Ping, and Hang-Hu lines in this province, have all been opened to traffic one after another. Therefore, the Road Bureau recently needs to purchase a large number of public cars for application. However, due to the soaring price of gold and the surge in foreign goods, the price of these cars has also increased. Therefore, Mr. Wu Zhuozhi, the chief of the car service of the bureau, carefully planned and invented a car trailer in the shortest possible time. It is economical and can carry more passengers and luggage. It is truly rare in the world. Moreover, the car body is stable, flexible, and extremely easy to tow without any hindrance. A few days ago, Chairman Zhang of the provincial government and his wife personally test-drove the car, passing through Hubin, Guanxiang, Baoyoufang, and the Sanlang Temple section. At that time, the onlookers along the way were very crowded, and everyone marveled. Although the scorching sun was like fire, the car had already left, but the onlookers were still reluctant to leave, all looking up and wanting to chase after it, because it was an unprecedented creation.</p>
<p>As for the structure of the car, except for the tires, axles, and certain parts, the rest are self-made, so it is exceptionally economical. It costs about 1,000 yuan to make one, which saves a lot compared to buying foreign goods. Since the invention of this car, it can also reduce the cost of drivers and gasoline when driving on the highway. It is now heard that Chairman Zhang has ordered the bureau to rush to make more vehicles and use the Gongsan section as a test site. It is expected that after the completion of the trial, the results will be satisfactory, and the world will imitate it, making travel convenient and bringing happiness to the people.</p>
<h3>Heart Shadows of Eastern Travel (25)</h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, tram lines are popular all over the city, and the fare is seven cents for a one-way trip and one dime and three cents for a round trip, regardless of distance, and can be accessed everywhere. Public buses charge one dime for a one-way trip. In addition, there are long-distance trams traveling to various parts of Tokyo Prefecture. They depart every five minutes from the station, and the fare starts from one dime, depending on the distance. Families in the middle and lower classes find housing prices in Tokyo City expensive, so they live in Tokyo Prefecture and commute by long-distance tram. It takes more than ten minutes and there is no inconvenience. In the morning and evening, long-distance trams are extremely crowded, as residents of Tokyo Prefecture come and go. For the sake of embellishing civilization, Tokyo City built an underground railway from Asakusa to Manseibashi, with a total of four stations. It was opened to traffic on January 1st of this year. The fare is one dime. It is safe, fast, and convenient for travelers. There are very few rickshaws, which have been naturally eliminated. Travelers from afar who do not know the streets find it difficult to take trams and have to hire cars. The fare in the city is one yuan per day for a one-way trip, and two dimes are added for each additional person, so the car fare is especially expensive every day. There are 13,968 cars in Tokyo City, and 70% of them are commercial vehicles. Most of the rickshaw pullers of the past have changed their ways and learned to drive cars. After learning, they either rent from car companies or borrow money at high interest rates to buy cars. The average daily income is about forty or fifty yuan. After deducting gasoline, rent, and other items, the net profit is about twenty yuan per day. The monthly income is six hundred yuan. The grooms are usually their children and nephews, and their salaries are only a little decoration, which is especially economical. Therefore, the car driver is the most popular occupation in Tokyo's labor force. Most of the commercial vehicles are new-style sedans, luxurious and magnificent, no different from the consulate's cars. Some old covered cars can be ridden for five dimes for a one-way trip. Most of the car drivers hired by car companies are poor Koreans, otherwise, those who are slightly able would not bother to do it. Simple cafeterias are the only restaurants for ordinary people. They are everywhere in the streets, and the interior is very clean. Most of the meals are set meals. The so-called set meal is a fixed dish and rice that cannot be changed. The breakfast is usually two dimes, including soup, pickles, rice, and a small bucket. Lunch is divided into five dimes and three dimes, including a fish, a vegetable, and a soup. Dinner is the same as lunch. If the rice is not enough, you can add a little. In addition, there are noodles, etc., for one or two dimes per bowl. Students, workers, and others all eat here, and the business is extremely developed. They are also supervised by the health police, who often come to check. The reporter has eaten there several times with friends, and the taste is extremely clean and delicious. It is truly the most economical restaurant in Japan. Most of the Chinese students in our country, except for a small part who eat at the Chinese Youth Association in Kanda District (the Youth Association has Chinese cooks who provide meals for four dimes per meal), also use simple cafeterias for their meals. The dormitories are all in Tokyo Prefecture, and the room fee is about ten yen per month. Usually, the most frugal students need fifty yen per month, which is equivalent to one hundred yuan in national currency, which is really difficult to make a living. This time, the players from our country stayed at the Japan Youth Hall, and the laundry and other matters were handled by the laundry company at a special discount. Washing a pair of socks cost one dime, a shirt cost four dimes, and a pair of white twill cloth suit pants cost one yuan. The representatives were speechless. In order to save money, the coaches told the players to wash the small items themselves, but the laundry expenses were still very considerable. Also, the four Indian players who went to Japan for the first time stayed in Shanghai for a short time. When the reporter visited them, they said that the prices in Shanghai were the cheapest, and the food and accommodation were extremely comfortable. Compared with Tokyo today, there is a world of difference. The life in Tokyo can be seen in a glimpse.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (248)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Sows Fortune and Gets a Diamond Ring? Only This Fate Has the Heart to Sing of Golden Threads</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said that was very good. Although I don't understand calligraphy, painting, or antiques, you should also buy a few tickets when you issue that kind of lottery ticket. Shi Guanping smiled and said, "Have you tasted the sweetness? You should buy more of our lottery tickets. To say something superstitious, your luck is very good. Taking advantage of this time of good luck, you won a second prize with the fortune ticket. Who knows, maybe you will win a first prize with our lottery ticket? All things that are close to gambling depend on luck. Let's take the most superficial game of mahjong as an example. If you are in good luck, even if you are a novice, you will win with a big hand, isn't there a saying in Suzhou that says, 'Even a novice can win with a good hand'? If you are in bad luck, even if you are an expert, luck will go against you. You yourself listen to the three, six, and nine bamboos and you can't win a peaceful hand, but the upstream family covers the six bamboos and wins. Then it becomes 'A robber fights a lawsuit and always loses.' At that time, you can only avoid the wind and be sensible. You are in very good luck now, so you can buy more tickets. After the tickets are printed, I will distribute them to you." Zuo Shichen said, "I suspect that the fruits and melons you donate are not very good things, but broken copper and rotten iron. Although I am an outsider and don't understand calligraphy, painting, or antiques, I have seen those collectors and antique dealers, and they are reluctant to show off a fine piece easily. When people want to see it, they always procrastinate. How can they be willing to part with it and donate it to the charity association?" Shi Guanping said, "You are right about that. Many collectors have this habit. They think they have a secret to themselves when they have a good thing, and they won't even let people take a look at it, as if they have married a beautiful concubine. They keep her hidden in a golden house and lock her in a jade pass. But now that things are more open, even if they have married a beautiful concubine, they often take her out to show off. There is no such thing as keeping her deeply hidden. But some people have such a temperament, and it is impossible to force them. However, collectors also have a kind of suffering. I think that if they encounter a generation of knowledgeable connoisseurs, collectors are extremely welcome. There is no way that they would not be willing to let them see their things. Moreover, they are honored by having a certain connoisseur look over their calligraphy and paintings, and they also ask him to write inscriptions. For other antiques, they also ask him to do research. But if they encounter that kind of fake connoisseur, who doesn't understand anything himself, but wants to blindly criticize others, saying that you are fake when it is indeed genuine, and after seeing it, he will spread rumors and spread rumors outside, no collector is willing to let him see it. Moreover, antiques can be explained to the knowledgeable, but it is difficult to explain them to ordinary people. Therefore, antiques are called antiques, and those who don't understand will always be separated. Furthermore, those antiques are probably not able to endure much suffering. There is no benefit in letting too many irrelevant people see them, not to mention the damage."</p>

<p>Gold Market Softens</p>
<h3>Psychological Anxiety, Market Shape Hesitant, Finally Retreats</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the attitude of the gold market on the 5th was secretly sluggish, but it contained unpredictable fluctuations. It was firm in the morning, tired at noon, and mediocre in the afternoon. The range of the daily fluctuations totaled nine taels, and it broke the 80 taels level again. As for the exchange rate, it remained stable. There were no large transactions in the market. The psychology of various dealers was hesitant, sometimes buying and sometimes selling. Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Xingyong, etc. all bought in, while Yuancheng, Yongheng, Yuancheng, Yongxiang, Yuwansheng, etc. mostly sold out. In the morning market, the previous day's large contract was reduced, and it opened high.

<h3>The Opening Was Still Pretty, but Later There Was a Big Setback</h3>
<p>The opening price of gold in September increased by two taels and one qian to 82 taels and seven qian for the gross price.

As for Japanese gold, Mitsui and Sumitomo absorbed nearly one tael, three qian, one point, and two five in Dalian. Then they stopped buying and the sellers in the market were active. At around 9:20, it was 81 taels and six qian, and then it went up about two taels. The announcement was not changed when it was posted first, and the time was 83 taels and six or seven qian. In an instant, Xiangyu, Hengxing, etc. sold out one after another, and it fell by four or five taels. At around 10 o'clock, it broke the 80 taels level and became 77 taels and eight qian. After entering, the buyers seemed to see the opportunity to buy, and it was raised by three taels. At 10:30, it was 81 taels, but the exchange rate was loose and the market sentiment was restless, so the price was difficult to support and it was in a tired state. It slowly retreated, falling a total of five or six taels. Until after 11:30, it suddenly fell to 75 taels and one qian. At that time, Hengxing slightly bought in and raised it by one or two taels.

At 3 o'clock, it was 75 taels and nine qian. Suddenly, it was raised by more than three taels to 79 taels and three qian, which was actually due to the instability of people's hearts. At 3:30, Yongheng, etc. sold out again, and it fell by two taels. However, there was a difference of one tael, and the market was turbulent and at a loss. At about 4:20, it was 76 taels and nine qian. At 4:30, it was spun up from 77 taels and one qian at the close. Compared with the 2nd (last weekend), it fell by three taels and a half.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market: Yarn Sales Exceptionally Strong</h3>
<p>The standard market is becoming increasingly strong.</p>
<p>The actual sales of cotton yarn are exceptionally brisk. The Cantonese merchants are becoming increasingly eager to collect supplies. The Xuzhou and Yunnan merchants are following suit, but mostly buying futures. The main reason is that this year's harvest is expected to be abundant, and there will definitely be a large demand in the future. Therefore, various merchants are taking precautions. The coarse yarn from several factories for October, November, and December has already been purchased, and the Japanese yarn for February and March of next year has all been sold. Therefore, the current market situation is extremely strong. The amount of goods dragged in by fellow merchants and customer merchants is very large. If spot sales do not go smoothly in the future, there will be drastic changes in the market. However, it is difficult for the current market price to fall, and the standard yarn for 10-count coarse yarn is becoming increasingly tight. Therefore, buyers must watch for 60 taels for customs clearance.</p>
<h3>Human Trademark Surges by Nearly Half a Tael</h3>
<p>The opening market for human trademark yarn was still strong, with all months rising by 4 or 5 qian. Later, as the number of sellers increased, it fell slightly. As a result, it rose by 1, 2, and 3 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was good, and the price of third-grade yarn rebounded, making the market even stronger. All months rose by 2, 3, 5, and 7 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,250 bales. Yongchang sold the most, at 1,000 bales. In addition, Taisheng, Kang Hanfeng, Lichang, Zhenda, Shenji, Dachang, Chengyi, and Chang sold between 300 and 800 bales. Tianchang bought the most, at 1,800 bales. In addition, Chongyu, Daji, Tianlong, Xiesheng, Shengtail, Daji, and Senkang bought between 400 and 950 bales. The closing prices of human trademark yarn are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Quiet and Unchanged</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm. American cotton is trending upward, and people's hearts are firm. Sellers are relatively scarce, and most are watching for American cotton to rise strongly in the early days. Therefore, buyers are increasing their purchases, and the market is rising relatively. However, spot cotton sales are exceptionally quiet. Various factories have no intention of buying, so transactions are cut off. The situation of new cotton in various places is still good. It is difficult to predict the weather in the future.</p>
<h3>Hankou Trademark Sellers are Relatively Scarce</h3>
<p>The opening market for Hankou trademark yarn rose by 2 qian following foreign cotton. Later, as the number of sellers increased, it fell. As a result, it rose by 5 fen.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm. Later, due to lack of rain in the drought areas and the activities of short sellers covering their positions, it suddenly turned strong. Futures rose by 17 to 25 points, and spot prices rose by 25 points. The English and Indian cotton markets were closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th dispatch):</p>

<p>Food: Dongxin Japonica Rice Continues to Rise by Half a Yuan</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, few boats arrived inland. Sales of Beigeng rice varied. Retail shops and going-out merchants were still lively, so the overall price rose by about 2 jiao. It was found that high-quality goods were recently scarce. The reason for the transactions was that middle and upper-quality goods were all listed at top prices of 21 yuan. Therefore, this increase was most sufficient for ordinary Japonica rice. The inquiry for old rice was less. The market situation was sluggish, but the price followed. Dongxin Japonica rice was still scarce, so the selling sentiment was calm. The price reached 20 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of half a yuan compared to before. The arrival and sales of thin indica rice were balanced, and the market was also strong. Medium-quality goods were also seen to rise in price. Currently, the situation for Japonica and thin rice is exceptionally stable. The price of white yuan suddenly turned stable, and the going-out route felt weak. The price has no immediate upward trend.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South</h3>
<p>Only two or three boats arrived at the river. Buying intentions in the street were weak, and the market situation turned calm. Changshu and Xixi machine-milled Japonica rice was rarely seen and stable. The higher grade of Suchang white Japonica rice was still strong, while the medium and lower grades seemed soft. The price varied by 1 jiao. Dongxin Japonica rice was still 20 yuan in this area, with few transactions, mainly due to lack of goods. The southern merchants' thin early indica rice was sometimes available and sometimes not, leading to a lack of standards in the market. The overall situation was stable. Yangdu pointed rice was also scarce, and the market situation shifted with the foreign rice. Yuan's sales were still not expanding. Although arrivals were not strong, prices were slightly revised.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Consistently and Wildly Rises Near and Far</h3>
<p>Foreign wheat rises rapidly... Existing stocks are weak... Sharp increase of more than four fen</p>
<p>After the opening of the vermicelli market yesterday morning, the prices for various months continued to rise sharply. Due to the rapid increase in the price of foreign wheat by 1.12 yuan to 1.14 yuan, people's hearts were agitated. The opening price was immediately raised by about 1.5 fen compared to the previous day. Afterwards, as major factories became increasingly reluctant to sell and off-market short sellers also aggressively covered their positions, and it was rumored that Tianjin would ship wheat to the Yangtze River area, but before the political situation was settled, there would be no smooth arrival, so near-term was tight due to inventory, while far-term increased wildly due to foreign wheat. Although small and medium-sized factories still took advantage of the situation to offer goods, the buying sentiment was strong, so the more they sold, the higher the price rose. If the factory's attitude does not change in the future, and if the timing is right, the upward trend is still considerable. As a result, August, September, and January rose by 3.75 fen each compared to the previous day, and October to December rose by 4.5 fen each.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>Spot goods are scarce and also good at 3-4 fen</p>
<p>The wheat futures market yesterday showed a consistent and sharp increase in the market for all months in the morning and afternoon. The reason for this was initially that the increase in foreign wheat prices stimulated the hearts of most people. Fundamentally speaking, the current stock of wheat is only about 50,000 bags, and most of them are of medium quality, with very few high-quality goods. Furthermore, the domestic shipping price has not been greatly reduced, and most hoarding households, due to the relationship of the purchase price, are unwilling to sell unless they hold to the target price. Therefore, the future of the exchange's standards is very worthy of consideration by operators. Due to this situation, the near-term is good, but the far-term is even better. As a result, this month rose by 7 fen compared to the previous day, September rose by 8 fen, October rose by 9 fen, November rose by 8 fen, December rose by 1 qian, and January rose by 4 fen. The spot wheat market is good because the standard has soared again and the arriving goods are thin, so the opening price of each grade is good at 3-4 fen. It is reported that Fuxin has bought more than 5,000 bags of wheat from Yaowan, Suqian, Jiangxi, Shantou, and Hankou.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Turn Dull to the North</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed another soft and flat situation. Although the ban on northern ports had been lifted, the northern merchants' appetite was very weak, disappointing many people. Many hoarding households did not dare to buy more, and some sold out due to disappointment, so the market showed a downturn. Yesterday, only the Tianjin merchants bought a few hundred bags of large and small sizes. No one else inquired. Inland merchants bought 2-3,000 bags of brown rice, Saigon, etc. The street also had some dealings, leading to a tired market that turned stable. It is estimated that 200 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were sold at a price of 16.95 yuan, and 1,000 bags of No. 2 rice were sold at a price of 14.1 yuan. 1,500 bags of small-sized rice were sold at prices of 15.4 yuan and 14.9 yuan. 2,000 bags of large-sized rice were sold at high prices of 14 yuan and ordinary prices of 12.8-9 yuan. 2,000 bags of small-sized brown rice were sold at a price of 12.5 yuan, and lower grades at 11.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Dried Cocoons: Daily Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>After our country's new cocoons are on the market, Japanese firms in recent years have been purchasing dried cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang and transporting them to Japan to supplement raw materials. This year, both our country's spring and summer cocoons have been in short supply, while Japan's harvest has been very abundant. Silk sales have been sluggish, and there is overproduction. In addition, our country's silk cocoon merchants have restricted the transportation of cocoons to Japan due to a lack of raw materials. Therefore, the daily sales of dried cocoons have been stagnant for a long time. In the past two months, no silkworm cocoons have been transported from our country to Japan.</p>
<h3>American Firms' Silk Sales Quietly Await Telegrams</h3>
<p>The transaction of futures silk by foreign firms in this port: The sales of American silk have begun to take action last weekend. As Chinese silk merchants believe that the price of silk is not cheap and European firms' opening prices are not high, the result of the negotiations is that the booking can only be completed after receiving a telegram from overseas. It remains to be seen. Yesterday, only Velon, etc., took in 20 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Samsung, etc., took in 15 packages of yellow coarse silk. The prices were all firm.</p>
<h3>Land Firms' Tea Arrivals: Over 140,000 Cases</h3>
<p>Land firms' green tea is produced from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, Suian, Dexing, and various other routes. It is also an important commodity in the foreign firms' tea market. Last year's output was estimated at over 320,000 cases. The number of teas from various routes this year has been greatly reduced. The reason for this is that the sales in the Shanghai market have been greatly sluggish, and the tea-making firms have taken a cautious approach and have stopped purchasing goods one after another. In the tea-producing areas, no one has been harvesting summer tea, and most of the spring tea has been sold as grain. Currently, the amount of land firms' tea that has arrived at various tea shops is two-thirds of the total, and the estimated amount is no more than 140,000 cases. The survey is divided as follows: Hongyuan Yong 26,833 cases, Shenyuan 19,820 cases, Yongshengchang 19,409 cases, Yuanfengrun 17,197 cases, Gong Shengyong 16,804 cases, Shengchang Sheng 11,427 cases, Yongxinglong 10,198 cases, Zhongxin Chang 8,816 cases, Rende Yong 4,732 cases, Yuancheng Yong 3,822 cases, Qianji 1,286 cases, for a total of 140,344 cases.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Pingchuan Firms Eagerly Purchase Suit Sets of Woolen Cloth</h3>
<p>Recently, Pingchuan firms have been continuously requesting samples and making inquiries about woolen cloth and hair goods to be sold at the autumn market. There is a particularly high demand for suit sets of woolen cloth. There are transactions of both scattered piece goods and whole cases. Scattered piece goods are mostly sent by post, while original cases are declared for export. However, goods from Beiping must have the original permit and original marks. These two firms have already shipped a large number of goods in the past few days. It is reported that dozens of items are still under negotiation.</p>
<h3>Public Auction Prices Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Tuesday, was the usual auction date for various fabrics by the British-owned Public Auction Company. A total of 81 lots, totaling 3,190 pieces, were scheduled for auction. 76 lots, totaling 2,960 pieces, were successfully auctioned. Among them, various weights of Liuhaishi cloth were not successfully sold due to price disagreements. Compared with the previous session, there were 6 fewer lots and 290 fewer pieces scheduled for auction. Guest firms only made small purchases in the Yangtze River area, and sales to the north were sluggish. As for prices, they generally trended downwards. This was mainly due to the unstable political situation, making it difficult to expect prices to improve. Only white foreign yarn rose by 2 qian per piece, and feathers silk was flat. The rest saw declines. The detailed numbers for each type of cloth are recorded below: Feather silk 11 cases, 360 pieces; Taixining silk 6 cases, 180 pieces; Yuan velvet 1 case, 20 pieces; Taixi satin 25 cases, 750 pieces; Foreign yarn 1 case, 50 pieces; City cloth 7 bales, 350 pieces; Bleached cloth 25 cases, 1,250 pieces.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Sheets Sold to Tianjin and Liaoning Firms</h3>
<p>18-gauge black iron sheets are a crucial necessity for winter. Northern firms inevitably purchase them during the summer and autumn. Large quantities have already been purchased in the previous week. It is reported that this is the second transaction, with the number of transactions reaching 8-900 bundles. It is found that the Liaodong and Tianjin firms purchased them. Although there were inquiries from Beiping and Qingdao, the actual transactions were limited. It is assumed that they also have orders locally. The price per bundle (100 pounds) is 11.5 taels. In addition, due to the favorable trend of 18-gauge sheets, 3-gauge to 13-gauge sheets with a size of 36 inches are also selling well, with a price of 9.3-4 taels.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Golden Lily Buds are Already Cheap and Suitable</h3>
<p>Prevent price increase later</p>
<p>Since the release of new golden needle vegetables, there have been quite a few arrivals before and after, and the stocks on the market are also thick. Therefore, the market price has gradually turned down, reaching as much as four or five taels. However, the trend seems to have reached a considerable level at this point, and it is now gradually stabilizing. Therefore, the purchases of various helpers have become lively again, and the number of plates are also being opened one after another. Ordinary goods are not more than twenty taels, which can be said to be extremely cheap. If the price increases again in the market, it will inevitably increase.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Star Film Company announces that its director Zheng Zhengqiu is skilled at creating delicate and poignant works, and that his recent films have made immeasurable contributions in the area of emotions, further enhancing his reputation.  The "Peach Blossom Lake," which he wrote and directed, has even deeper contributions.  Filming is nearing completion, and the Peach Blossom Lake scene was filmed yesterday.  Originally, it was intended to be filmed using natural scenery, but after considering the angle of photography, the position of the filming, and the beauty of the light, it was deemed more appropriate to use artificial sets. Therefore, the company's set design and art departments collaborated to set up the scene at the outdoor filming location.  The lake area is very large, and hundreds of peach trees are decorated with bright and vibrant peach blossoms, shining brilliantly and reflecting the light of the lake water, creating extreme beauty.  Coupled with soft and pleasing electric lights, the actors in the play, Hu Die, Xia Peizhen, and Zheng Xiaoqiu, produce a supreme beautifying effect.  This set, along with the original Kulun snow scene and the modernly decorated Miss's bedroom and the luxurious piano room, are rare scenes in the development of domestic films.</p>

<h3>Newly Invented Automobile Trailer</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>With Kitchen, Bedroom, and Dining Room</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the automobile industry is progressing and developing soundly. However, it is never easy to satisfy inventors, no matter how much they invent. For example, the current automobiles are not suitable for long-distance travel. Why? Because the space inside is too small; one cannot cook or sleep. Isn't this a very obvious shortcoming? In order to solve this problem, a new invention has been made. What is it? It is a trailer attached to the back of the car (as shown in the picture). The manufacturer is the Didjilao Auto Company, and the value is $385.</p>
<p>This trailer is six and a half feet wide, nine feet long, and six feet four inches high. The interior layout combines a kitchen and a bedroom. The body is made of solid wood, but the chassis is made of sturdy steel plates. The wooden boards on the four walls have the function of regulating the climate. In winter, it can ward off the cold, and in summer, it can keep out the heat. In winter, there is also a gasoline stove for heating. This type of car is most suitable for hunters. The top of the trailer is made of the same material as the top of the car. It is not afraid of rain and is not easily damaged. Moreover, a small boat can be placed on top. The weight of the entire trailer is only one-quarter of the weight of the car. It is very convenient for going uphill and at high speeds.</p>
<p>The detailed layout is roughly as follows: the bed is four feet wide and six feet long, with a window at each end. There are two refrigerators that can store 25 pounds of ice, and a water bucket with a capacity of five gallons, which not only provides drinking water but also is used for washing clothes and cooking. The electricity for the lights is supplied by a battery. The stove is a gasoline stove with two pots. A table can accommodate four people for dining and playing cards. Two chairs are also available for resting.</p>
<p>The interior layout is light blue and cream color. If other colors are desired, then an additional ten dollars will be charged. The advantage of this type of car is that it can alleviate the limitations of the general automobile. Long-distance travelers can cook their own meals when they are hungry and sleep peacefully at night. Although one is traveling, it is as comfortable as being at home. Currently, many people have purchased trailers, which can be easily detached.</p>
<p>Some people say that with a trailer, the speed will definitely decrease. However, this is not the case, because the bottom of the trailer is also connected to the engine of the front car, so the speed is not affected at all. It does not suffer major shocks when climbing hills, because it has a kind of spring to maintain balanced force.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites for Developing Transportation</h3>
<p>— Qu Zi</p>
<p>If we want to develop transportation in China today, building railways requires raising large sums of money and taking years to complete. If we talk about operating airlines, flight safety has not yet gained the trust of people, and the high price of tickets is beyond the means of most people in society. Therefore, neither of the two can be developed for the time being. Considering the situation, it is easier to build automobile roads.</p>
<p>I have investigated that the United States currently has an average of one mile of highway in every square mile of area. If one takes a public bus from San Francisco, one can cross the Americas and reach New York directly. The length of the road is about three thousand miles, and the accommodations and meals provided along the way are not inferior to those on a train. The road surface of this highway is extremely solid and extremely flat. The speed of the car is approximately 50 to 60 miles per hour continuously. The road administration also has buses and freight vehicles going to and from various villages to pick up passengers and take them to the railway trunk lines.</p>
<h3>A Type of Road Building Machine from Gadby</h3>
<p>Most of the roads in China have always been pedestrian paths, which can only accommodate small carts and rickshaws. If we want to allow the passage of buses and freight vehicles, then the weight of the vehicles themselves is already sufficient to damage the road surface, let alone carrying passengers and goods. Therefore, the highways that China needs today are exactly like those in the United States: they must be solid and flat, and convenient for drainage, so that they can be used in all seasons, and problems such as the speed of vehicles and the comfort of travelers will be solved easily.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Shi Waibo, the China representative of the California-based Gadby Motor Company, gave a speech at a luncheon at the Rotary Club of Shanghai last Thursday on the functions of the new Gadby road building machine. According to him, this road building machine only requires two workers and can build three miles of road per day. The cost of building one mile of road is only ten dollars. If road construction is done entirely by hand, the cost would be ten times higher than this. After the speech, a demonstration of the operation of this road building machine was shown on the Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) long-distance highway, showing its extremely skillful abilities to dig, plow, shovel, and roll. It is hereby introduced on the right, perhaps to the delight of those concerned with road construction.</p>
<h3>Road Vehicle Management Issues</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of automobiles has increased daily, and the method of managing their movement on the road has been the subject of much research. Professor MacDonald of political science at Benxifan University in the United States has written a book detailing the solution to this problem. Here are the main points as reference material for Shanghai's road administration.</p>
<p>The width of the road should be based on the amount of traffic on the road surface. The road should not be too narrow or too short. The traffic lights and various signs for management at road intersections should not be too small. The colors must be bright and the wording must be simple. The location must be conspicuous, and special attention should be paid at night, so that it can be recognized at a glance from far and near.</p>
<p>Widening the road surface is the only way to alleviate traffic congestion, but in prosperous streets, the land price is too expensive, and the cost of buying, selling, and reconstruction is too high. It is better to change to a longer aisle, that is, to incorporate the original pedestrian road into the road and, when building the house, to advance the second floor of the residence by six to ten feet as a pedestrian road, so that the area above the floor remains the same as the original area. (According to the road law, Dama Road has already imitated this style.)</p>
<p>Is the red and green light for traffic control harmful to the movement of automobiles? After much consideration by many experts, it is generally believed that if the green light suddenly changes to a red light, the car must stop immediately, and when the red light changes to a green light, the car must rush forward.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Changing between red and green lights too quickly is prone to causing accidents. It is advocated to add an amber light between the red and green lights as a kind of preparatory signal. The timing of the lights is also a problem. The city of Detroit (the world's automobile industry base), which currently has the most automobiles, has recently been testing two new types of road traffic lights. Once they are effective, they will be implemented in various places. On busy streets, the most appropriate speed for cars is fifteen miles per hour. If it is too fast, the distance between cars will increase, and there is a deep fear that they will collide with each other, so the capacity of the road surface for vehicles cannot be fully utilized. Outside the city, where there are fewer vehicles, the speed can be increased. In busy cities, only fifteen miles per hour is allowed.</p>
<p>Parking lots occupy the most road surface. One of the most difficult things to solve in managing automobiles in large cities is the length of parking time, which varies depending on the local situation. Sometimes the road surface is insufficient. Large factories and large stores should automatically provide parking spaces for employees. However, shops on busy streets are easier to move out of the way and theaters are even easier, because land prices are high in busy cities and it is not easy to obtain so much space. The only way to remedy this is to specially build a central parking building to accommodate them. Currently, there are still few first-class large cities with this type of parking lot.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Long-Distance Bus Travel</h3>
<p>— Li Ji</p>
<p>Roads are the lifeline of a country, the foundation of transportation, and the tool of commerce. All countries in Europe and the United States attach importance to road construction. The cost in the annual financial budget is huge, and the construction plan is also the most perfect. Our country has recently learned from this and is actively carrying out road construction work, sparing no effort. The national roads that have been built already have more than 20,000 li, and the results are quite visible.</p>
<p>Now that each province in our country has provincial roads, and the interior is also opening up. The long-distance bus business is also developing at the same time, which makes the transportation between cities and towns extremely convenient. In this early stage of the rise of long-distance buses, although the local authorities encourage traffic, they should also pay attention to the driving regulations to avoid accidents and hinder construction.</p>
<p>In the United States, passengers who take public buses pay more than 1.5 trillion people a year. The caution and carelessness of drivers are related to people's livelihood and social peace. The National Long-Distance Bus Association of the United States has newly formulated a set of driving regulations for the safety of local people and passengers. It is quite valuable and can be used for reference and research by the automobile industry in our country. The full text is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Elephant Trunk Almighty</h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>Rose is a famous elephant in the American circus. She is intelligent, docile, and agile. Her daily operations are no different from those of humans. She can even refuel and fill water. The illustration shows Rose opening the water tank cap of a Chevrolet six-cylinder car and pouring clear water. This kind of work is a daily routine, so her owner cherishes her very much.</p>

<h3>Rare Automobile News from Around the World</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The success of car shock absorbers: German Captain Franz Karl Schleiff has recently invented a car shock absorber that can prevent passengers from being injured in car accidents. Mr. Schleiff recently tested this device three times in New York with great success. Initially, Mr. Schleiff drove a sports car at a speed of 26 miles per hour and crashed into the back of another sports car. The second time, the car was traveling at 18 miles per hour, and Mr. Schleiff drove the car towards a steel-concrete pillar and crashed into it. The third time, the car was traveling at nearly 30 miles per hour and crashed into a small car parked on the side of the road. The small car that was hit was destroyed. In these three tests, Mr. Schleiff was unharmed, but only suffered minor injuries during the last collision. During the test, Mr. Schleiff's crash absorber was installed on the sports car, and an electrical meter was used to record the car's speed at the time of the collision. This shock-absorbing crash device is shaped like an ordinary steel bumper bar. There is also a three-inch rubber plate that is parallel to the machine body and connected by steel scissors. When the car collides with the car, the rubber extends outward and the steel scissors also open, so the force of the collision is divided to the left and right, so that it is not related to the machine body. This device has special sales rights in Europe and the United States. The manufacturing location is in Germany.</p>
<p>General Motors' passenger car production: In 1929, the number of passenger cars registered in the United States was 22,599,701, of which 6,356,901 were produced by General Motors, that is, 28.13% of the registered number of various cars were produced by General Motors Corporation. This number is the same as the number of cars registered in the United States ten years ago. General Motors Manager Xuan Lesi said that this is a reward from customers for their satisfaction with General Motors cars.</p>
