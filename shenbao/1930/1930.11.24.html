<p>四中全會朱家驊於『請設立編譯專處編譯各國學術書籍以期普及新智識於國民而與各國作學術上之溝通案』議决原則通過交國府飭敎育權關斟酌辦理茲錄原提案如下</p>
<p>一切事業皆以學術爲其根本各國學術修明所以百度振興中國學術窳敗所以各項建設不易完善書籍爲學術之表現研究之階梯各國學術書籍汗牛充揀中國則寥若晨星亟宜設立編譯專處總領譯事以促進學術之研究茲分述正面及反面理由如下</p>
<p>中國研究人才固甚缺乏即欲從事研究亦苦無書可讀其原因凡有三端（一）散見各國搜集不易（二）各國文字不同通甲國文字者未必通乙國（三）外國書價值太昻不易購置日本人有鑒於此以編譯西書爲最初着手之辦法世界上每一較爲重要之書籍出版無不立刻譯成日文不但在文字上可以普及於其本國人民而其書價較之原書亦復廉省不少所以能引起其本國學者之興趣而更作高深之探討</p>
<p>反對者或以日本譯書大都是私家自動繙譯並非全由政府主持現在中國坊間繙譯書籍時有出版祇要有研究之需求自然有繙譯之供給何必由政府特設專處以辦理此不急之務此說似是而實非試觀坊間新出刋物學術書籍與非學術書籍二者孰多商人以營利爲目的祗知迎合潮流不知提倡風氣專門學術書籍在中國現在情形需要較少亟宜由政府積極提倡不可待其自然發達此即吾黨宗旨所謂學外國要從頭趕上去不可隨後學步也</p>
<p>辦法一·中央設立編譯處並附設圖書館除購備各國舊有名着外並隨時購買或交換凡新出關於學術之刋物務期搜集詳盡毫無遣漏二·應行繙譯之書籍除由本處自譯外並得指派國内各大學敎授協助譯事三·各私人譯述可送由本處審核以後從優出貲購買以示鼓勱四·責令各省各地普遍設立圖書館購備本處出版書籍公開閲覽以期普及五·本處出版書籍祇可酌收印刷工本以期售價低廉普及民衆六·本處隨時審定學術名詞俾着譯者所用名詞可以整齊劃一以上所陳理由及辦法是否有當敬請公决提議者朱家驊連署者陳立夫</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yan Xishan Considers a Path to Leave the Country <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yan Ding Departs Wutai Today</p>
<p>Zhang Yinwu Voluntarily Resigns</p>
<p>Rong Honglu Returns to Taiyuan</p>
<p>Sources from Beiping state that preparations for Yan's departure are complete, with only the route remaining undecided. It is believed that if Zhang Xueliang can provide firm guarantees, he will depart through Tianjin or Beiping; otherwise, he will have to travel through Suiyuan and Mongolia, heading to Siberia. As there are many bandits in Suiyuan, his trusted confidant Wang Jingguo's troops have been ordered to prepare to secure the roads in Suiyuan and Mongolia as a possible route. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sources from Beiping report that the Jin faction is most concerned about Jiang and Zhang attacking Shanxi with mercenary troops. Therefore, many generals hope Yan will leave soon. Yan has ordered Dai to formally notify all agencies that all official documents and military reports should be sent to the Jin-Sui Garrison Headquarters and that the name of the Third Route Army Headquarters should no longer be used. He has ordered Zhou Shilian's unit to be disbanded, Guan Fu'an's unit to be merged into Yang Chengyuan's unit, and has allocated private funds of 10,000 yuan each to Wang Jingguo and other generals with troops as parting gifts, in preparation for the future. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rong Honglu has returned to Taiyuan and met with Xu Shang to report on the negotiations in Nanjing. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>A certain consulate in Tianjin received a wireless message from Taiyuan stating that the central government's minimum condition for the aftermath of the Shanxi army is for Yan to leave. After persuasion from Xu Yongchang and Shang Zhen, Yan has agreed to leave Hebian Village on the 24th for Gansu, or possibly leave the country via Tianjin, although this has not been announced. (23rd)</p>
<p>Yan Ding left Wutai on the 24th. (23rd)</p>
<p>Zhang Yinwu has voluntarily resigned because he is not favored by either the Jinan or Jinbei factions. Both the Left Wing Army and the Fourth Route Army headquarters have been abolished. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Central Government Plane Arrives in Taiyuan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan: Central government planes have been coming to Shanxi for days but none have arrived in Taiyuan. One plane arrived at noon on the 23rd and dropped two bombs, which did not explode. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Talks by Zhao Shouyu, the Central Government's Pacification Commissioner for Shanxi</p>
<h3 id="e3">Resolving the Shanxi Situation Is Not a Problem <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Shanxi Pacification Commissioner Zhao Shouyu told reporters: (1) The Pacification Commissioner's temporary office will be set up in Xi'an. The internal organization and official office location will be decided after Chiang Kai-shek approves. All pacification measures will also be implemented after instructions are received. (2) The Northwestern aftermath problem can be completely resolved if Yan and Feng leave the country. On the 22nd, Shang Zhen, Fu Zuoyi, and Yan himself sent telegrams to their representative, Lu Xian, requesting that he forward them to the central government. Yan is willing to accompany Feng to leave the country immediately. The central government has already decided on detailed measures for the Shanxi aftermath and has reportedly discussed them with Zhang Xueliang several times. In general, it has been decided that resolving the Shanxi situation is not a problem. (3) While political education in the Northwest should be actively reorganized, transportation is particularly urgent. When I passed through Xi'an on the 20th, I met with Yang Hucheng, who said that Shaanxi's administration would prioritize transportation, followed by other matters. Work has already begun on reorganizing the Xi'an-Tongguan road and bridges, which is expected to be completed in six months. There are also plans to establish an airline between Xi'an and Zhengzhou. All plans will be implemented after being approved by the central government. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Control Yuan Is Being Organized</p>
<h3 id="e4">Scheduled to be Established on January 1st <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The position of President of the Control Yuan has been decided at the Fourth Plenary Session to be held by Yu Youren. It is reported that Yu has already begun preparing. The number of members is set at 19 to 29, all of whom will be senior officials. They will be selected by the central government from appointees from various provinces, which has not yet been decided. It is expected that the Control Yuan will be formally established on January 1st of next year. At the same time, the Audit Council will be closed and reorganized into an Audit Department, reporting directly to the Control Yuan. (23rd)</p>
<p>Three Pacification Commissioners to be Sworn in Today</p>
<h3 id="e5">Pacification Regulations to be Announced Soon <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Liu Zhenhua, Zhang Zhijiang, and Li Mingzhong are scheduled to be sworn in at the National Government on the 24th. The pacification regulations have been drafted by the headquarters and consist of 28 articles, which will be announced soon. The regulations stipulate that the Pacification Commissioners are appointed by the National Government and are under the direct command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. All security and local police forces within the pacification zones are under the command of the Pacification Commissioners. The bandit suppression period is temporarily set for four months, with two months dedicated to suppression and two months dedicated to rural clearing. The suppression method emphasizes encirclement to eliminate roots and never incorporates bandits. The organization of the Pacification Commissioner's office includes six main departments: staff, secretariat, military affairs, adjutant, logistics, and military law. The office locations for the three provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi are temporarily set in Luoyang or Tongguan, for Henan, Anhui, and Hubei in Xinyang, and for Jiangsu in Yangzhou. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Zhang Zhijiang is scheduled to be sworn in as Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner at the National Government on the morning of the 24th. He has submitted requests to the central government, the National Government, and the headquarters to oversee the oath. The internal personnel will be announced soon and organizational work will begin. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Japan's Unemployment Bonds <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese government has long prided itself on a policy of not issuing bonds. Even in the face of recent severe financial difficulties, it still loudly proclaimed that it would never issue bonds, no matter what. However, in reality, various projects could not be stopped, and unemployment was increasing day by day, so it could not sit idly by. Thus, it began to shift the burden from the central budget to local governments, allowing them to issue local bonds to carry out relief projects, thereby maintaining the central government's facade of not issuing bonds. But in fact, this method only transfers the name of national debt to local governments and burdens local finances. In reality, it cannot hide the failure of its non-bond policy and is not a good strategy. Therefore, today it has no choice but to openly abandon its policy and resolutely implement its bond plan. According to Japanese news reports, the unemployment bonds that the government has decided to issue will be jointly issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministries of Communications, Agriculture and Forestry, and Railways for 49 million yuan. Combined with the 56.6 million yuan planned to be issued by the special accounting, the new bonds for the next year will total over 100 million yuan, which is not a small amount. Those who attack the Seiyukai say that when the current cabinet was in opposition, it opposed the Tanaka policy with the theory that public debt would lead to the downfall of the country and loudly proclaimed a non-bond policy. Now that it has formed a cabinet, it has abandoned its non-bond policy. Those who defend the government say that this is by no means the result of abandoning the non-bond policy. I think all this is unnecessary to argue. Public debt is not absolutely unissuable. It only matters whether the debt raised can be effectively and fully used for the designated project. If today's Japanese debt can be effectively and fully used to relieve unemployment, then in this helpless situation, there is no harm in abandoning the past policy. If it cannot be fully used to relieve unemployment and is secretly transferred to other unnecessary projects, then even if it is defended by not abandoning the policy, how can it cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the country? If the government's policy benefits the people, then even if they oppose it today, they will welcome it in the future. If it is not beneficial to the people and is even harmful, then even if they welcome it today, they will oppose and criticize it in the future. I use this to observe the results of the Japanese government's bond issuance.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Japanese Government's Bond Issuance Plan <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Breaks Through 100 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Abandoning the Non-Bond Policy</p>
<p>Opposition Party Criticizes Heavily</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Japan Allied Press): In order to solve the current unemployment problem, the government has decided that the Ministry of Internal Affairs will issue 30 million yuan in unemployment bonds for the following purposes: (1) National highway improvement projects: 15 million yuan; (2) Prefectural and county road improvement projects: 10 million yuan; (3) General relief funds subsidy: 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Dentsu News Agency): In addition to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the unemployment bond issuance plan also includes: (1) Ministry of Communications' subsidy for long-distance sea routes: 5 million yuan; (2) Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's subsidy for drainage improvement projects: 4 million yuan; (3) Ministry of Railways' new railway bonds: 10 million yuan. If all proposed issuance plans are approved, the total amount will reach 49 million yuan. Combined with the already planned issuance amount of 56.6 million yuan for special accounting, the total amount of new bonds for the next year will reach 105.6 million yuan. The government's savings department and the Bank of Japan will underwrite all of these bonds, but the bond market will inevitably be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Dentsu News Agency): Finance Minister Inoue stated regarding the government's unemployment bond issuance plan: "The number of unemployed people has increased due to military reduction and reorganization. The relief for this situation cannot be solely entrusted to local autonomous bodies. Therefore, it has been decided to issue unemployment bonds for a limited period of one year. This does not imply a policy shift. Although the Ministry of Communications requested the issuance of seafarer relief and shipping route subsidy bonds, this needs to continue until next year and beyond, so it is difficult to approve. I believe that the recession will not continue for a long time."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Dentsu News Agency): Regarding the government's unemployment bond issuance plan, the House of Peers stated: "The opposition party may criticize the bond issuance and make a big show of it, but in reality, the bond issuance is already too late. The current increase in unemployment is to be expected." The Seiyukai stated: "When the Minseito party was in opposition, they advocated that public debt would lead to the downfall of the country. Now, they have abandoned their non-bond policy, which is evidence of the current government's policy flaws. If the government continues to adopt a passive approach, the recession cannot be resolved. Although bond issuance can muddle through for a while, it will not ultimately reduce unemployment." They severely criticized the instability of the current government's policies.</p>

<p>Houses Collapsed</p>
<p>Traffic Disrupted</p>
<p>Los Angeles, 22nd (Associated Press) - Today, a strong northeast wind blew along the Pacific coast. Southern California suffered severe damage, with five people killed and many houses collapsing. Navigation was temporarily suspended in ports such as San Pedro, and many small boats were destroyed. In some places, wind speeds reached as high as 106 miles per hour. At Altadena, an aircraft was destroyed, and all airline flights were grounded. Along the coast, the wind stirred up sand, making it difficult for drivers to see, and many car accidents occurred as vehicles were blown around and lost control. In the San Bernardino area, roads were covered with high drifts of sand, completely halting traffic. During the height of the wind, several fires broke out, and the flames spread rapidly due to the strong gusts. In one location, over a thousand people were involved in firefighting efforts. Altadena was the hardest hit, with forty shorelines blown down, blocking roads. It took a hundred workers to clear the debris. Losses from broken glass alone reached several thousand U.S. dollars.</p>

<p>New York News - The era of practical application of robot-piloted aircraft has arrived. Recently, Eastern Air Transport has launched a transatlantic air route using robot-piloted aircraft for the last several weeks. Experts state that the use of robot pilots for passenger transport is sufficiently safe. The results of practical experiments on two or three important mail routes have shown success, using three-engine military aircraft from Detroit to Dayton, Ohio, and from there to Washington, D.C., with no deviation in direction and without the assistance of a pilot except during landing. This success is due to the installation of a gyroscope that constantly maintains the same altitude and attitude of the aircraft. Aviation experts predict that in the near future, robots will be used in all air transport, and the use of robots will allow for safe travel even in heavy fog or darkness. Eastern Air Transport plans to fly 10,500 miles daily with robot-piloted aircraft. (World News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e62">Account of the Defeat of Communist Bandits in Jin and Feng <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>He Long, Kuang, and others Flee to the Hubei Border</p>
<p>Sichuan and Hunan Troops Pursue in Separate Routes</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence - Following the withdrawal of He Long, Kuang Jixun, and other communist bandits from Nanhua, they infiltrated Jin City and attempted to attack Feng City. The troops of Chen Quzhen, the First Garrison Commander, and the troops of Dai Huiyuan, the Hunan-West Bandit Suppression Commander, in conjunction with the Sichuan army of Zhang Ying's division, launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression, recovering Jin City on the 11th of this month. At the same time, Chen's troops, who had been defending Feng City, attacked the bandits outside the city, and the siege of Feng was lifted. The bandits fled north of Feng to Zhangjia Factory, Mengxi City, and Zhoujiadu, scattering towards the Gong'an and Songzi areas on the Hubei border. They are currently being pursued in separate routes. The reports from various armies are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan Army Division Commander Zhang Ying reported the operational situation before the recovery of Jin City: "According to a report from Brigade Commander Ma (Kunshan) from Xujiapu at Shen hour (3-5 PM), (1) My Zhou regiment engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in the west bank area. Our officers and soldiers actively and fiercely attacked the bandits, fighting for about two hours, killing nearly a thousand bandits, including a fake bandit regiment commander and over ten company, platoon, and squad leaders. We occupied Baiyangdi, Wu Gongdi, and the area along the river at 3 PM and are still engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits. (2) My Yin and Duan regiments occupied Nanpankou and then pursued the bandits in separate routes. The bandits resisted at every step, but our officers and soldiers were extraordinarily brave. After fierce fighting for about an hour, we occupied the Xujiapu and Hongmiao lines. The bandits are fleeing to the Xiaodukou area and are holding the line along the river. We are currently attacking to seize the crossing. (3) It is reported that after the communist bandits were fiercely attacked by us, a small part has fled to the Mengxi City and Zhougongdu areas, seemingly intending to return to Gong'an and cause trouble in Hubei again. Furthermore, according to my scouts returning from Jin, when the bandits were engaged in fierce fighting with our troops in the Wangyougang area, they were already hurriedly building fortifications along the river in Jin City. I have decided to launch a general attack at dawn on the next day, setting a time limit to recover Jin City and eradicate the villains. Respectfully submitted, Zhang Ying, engraved at Chen hour (7-9 AM) on the next day."</p>
<p>Hunan-West Garrison Army Corps Commander Chen Yunbian and others telegraphed from Linli: "(1) I heard the densest gunfire around Baiyangdi in Jin City at Si hour (9-11 AM) on the Zhen day (likely 11/11/1930). I immediately dispatched the elite soldiers of the first, second, and third battalions of my regiment to cooperate with the elite soldiers of Liu camp of Dai's regiment (Ji Tao), pushing back the enemy outside the east gate and pursuing them to the vicinity of Renhepu, killing many bandits. We then defeated the bandits at Renhepu, and the bandits fled north to Mengxi City. At 1 PM, I, Chen Yunqi, advanced into Jin City with friendly army Zhang's division. I am currently supervising my troops and Liu's camp of Dai's regiment to clear out the bandits outside the city. Ji Tao is currently leading his troops to release families and cross the river to assist in the suppression, aiming to eliminate them. The bandits destroyed the telegraph lines outside the city yesterday afternoon and are currently being repaired. Chen Yunqi, Dai Jitao, and Tan Zhenhua bow and stamp truthfully. (2) The crowd of bandits besieging Feng City was fiercely repelled by my brothers dividing their troops and leaving the city on the Zhen day. I already telegraphed to the commander-in-chief on the Zhen afternoon. As for the supporting troops from various sides, Ma's brigade of the Sichuan army occupied Jin City on the Zhen You hour (5-7 PM). Li Weichen and Xiang Zhenchu's troops arrived at Feng City with Ji Tao's regiment at 3 PM on the Wen day (likely 11/12/1930). We have heard that the bandits have the appearance of fleeing upwards. Li, Xiang, and Dai's troops have already split up and are pursuing them this morning. Another small group fled south across the river from Xin'an Ferry. Our pursuing troops have split up and are tracking them down. I am also telegraphing this to you and hope you will forward it to the commander-in-chief as a prayer, Chen Yunqi bows in the Yuan seal. (3) Tao's troops forcibly crossed the Liu Jiahe River at 1 PM on the Zhen day and attacked the bandits outside the south gate. The bandits have already fled to Luoxi City and Qingni Gang. We are currently meeting with friendly armies and pursuing them. Further details will be reported later. Dai Jitao bows in the Wen seal." (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Situation in Suiyuan Gradually Tense <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Division Commander Guo Fengshan Flees from Suiyuan</p>
<p>Zhao Chengshou Leads Troops into Suiyuan for Garrison</p>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence - Recent external reports claiming that Suiyuan Chairman Li Peiji had attached himself to the surrendered troops were all rumors and misunderstandings. This is because Li had long relinquished military power and held little value for affiliation, merely signing a pro forma resignation without approval. However, Division Commander Guo Fengshan, who had been stationed in the Suiyuan region for a long time, had indeed fled, and his destination remains unknown. The reason for his flight was due to a major military issue involving his subordinate Chen Yujia, the chief of the military police inspection office, and Jia Youchuan, the commander of his direct regiment, who was subsequently detained by Zhao Chengshou. Chen Yujia and local military officer Chen Desheng were executed one after another, causing widespread panic. Furthermore, former committee members of the Provincial Party Department, Ji Yifan and Chen Guoying, were all placed under surveillance. The outcome remains uncertain. The circumstances were complex due to various factors, both military and political. Strict secrecy was maintained, making it difficult to ascertain the details at the time. After Guo Fengshan fled, a small portion of his troops mutinied, but Zhao Chengshou used swift and decisive measures to prevent a major upheaval. However, the rumors had already caused considerable unrest.</p>
<p>The Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters was renamed the Suiyuan Border Defense District Garrison Headquarters, with Zhao Chengshou as the commander. Zhao recently deployed more than one division of troops, dividing the garrison area into two sectors: (A) the bandit suppression zone, covering the counties in the heart of Suiyuan Province; and (B) the border defense zone, covering the areas near Datong and Wuyuan. Large groups of bandits scattered upon hearing the news, while small, vicious elements continued to attack villages and towns from time to time. Fortunately, Zhao's suppression efforts have been somewhat effective, and the four rural districts remain relatively peaceful. However, the establishment of the border defense district headquarters in the Public Welfare Goods Warehouse, along with its military law, military supplies, armaments, staff, adjutant, and secretarial sections, has created a sense of unease. Moreover, the addition of more than one division of troops has placed a heavy burden on supplies, and the counties are showing signs of distress. The current authorities have announced that all supplies will be offset against the land tax, but with limited granaries, the people fear that they will face the risk of starvation again after enduring famine.

<p>Shanxi Currency Totaled 100 Million Yuan in Circulation</p>
<h3 id="e64">Taiyuan Currently Discussing Five Measures to Maintain Currency Value <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - The paper money disaster in Shanxi has now become an unmanageable crisis. Before going to Mount Wutai, Yan Xishan repeatedly convened meetings for six days to study various measures to maintain the currency's value, but to no avail. Before his departure, he repeatedly urged Chairman Shang Zhen to find a way to maintain it and prevent it from becoming worthless paper. Xu Yiqing, the president of the Provincial Bank, followed Yan to Mount Wutai and then immediately returned to Taiyuan to implore Shang to help, with extremely earnest words. If the Shanxi currency truly becomes worthless, the 20 million people of Shanxi will suffer the same fate, and Yan and his confidants will also be affected. Shang had long known the difficult measures to maintain the Shanxi currency, but since he had taken over the provincial government, he could not shirk his responsibility. In recent days, he frequently convened representatives of chambers of commerce from all counties in the province (two from each county chamber of commerce) who had arrived in Taiyuan, along with managers of various branches, to discuss rescue measures. As a result, five measures were decided upon: (1) Starting from the 16th, the issuance of new banknotes will be stopped. (2) The land tax throughout the province will be increased by one yuan per tael (the total land tax in Shanxi is 5.5 million taels), specifically for maintaining the market price of the Shanxi currency and not for other purposes. (3) All kinds of taxes and levies will be collected in cash and not in Shanxi currency. (4) Another one-time donation will be levied from all counties in the province, with a quota of 6 million yuan, not in grain or fodder, but in cash. (5) An order will be issued to all merchants and people in the province to conduct transactions without discounting the Shanxi currency below the minimum market price of 2.5 yuan per silver dollar. It is still unknown whether these five measures can be implemented one by one after the decision, because the second measure, increasing the land tax, has already been implemented once this spring due to military circumstances (at that time, it was an increase of two yuan per tael). Now, increasing it again may exhaust the people's resources and cause serious opposition. It is said that this matter was not Shang Zhen's original intention, but Xu Yiqing's plan. After the above resolution was announced, Xu and others declared that the total amount of Shanxi currency issued was only 50 million yuan and that with the current effective maintenance measures, it would not be difficult to recover the value of the banknotes. However, according to reliable investigations, the amount of Shanxi currency issued has reached 100 million yuan. The detailed figures are as follows: from January of the Republic of China year 8 to the end of October of the Republic of China year 19, the Shanxi Provincial Bank issued and circulated various banknotes: 1.27244692 yuan in one-jiao banknotes; 2.0282395 yuan in two-jiao banknotes; 1364065 yuan in five-jiao banknotes; 14.65017 yuan in one-yuan banknotes; 6.8287 million yuan in five-yuan banknotes; 19.22319 yuan in ten-yuan banknotes; 2.79635 yuan in fifty-yuan banknotes; 38900 yuan in one-hundred-yuan banknotes. The total of the above silver dollar banknotes is 47.0144094 yuan. In addition, the copper coin notes are: 911364 diao and 800 wen in ten-coin notes (each coin is 10 wen, so ten coins equal 100 wen); 1.3003673 diao and 350 wen in twenty-coin notes; 230676 diao in fifty-coin notes; 687221 diao and 300 wen in one-hundred-coin notes; 25500 diao in three-hundred-coin notes; 800 diao in five-hundred-coin notes. The total of the above copper coin notes is 3.159235 diao and 100 wen. (According to the market price, every four diao is equivalent to one silver dollar.) This is equivalent to 78980877 yuan. As of the end of October, the amount stored in all branch banks was 19.0499224 yuan, and the amount stored in the Taiyuan head office was 27.770753861 yuan. The above recorded figures for the number of banknotes issued and the amount stored in the head and branch offices are all from the reports of friends at the Taiyuan head office and are naturally reliable. In addition, it is also heard that during the military emergency in June and July of this summer, Yan borrowed large sums of money from the bank on four separate occasions to cover military expenses, totaling more than 23.5 million yuan. Of this amount, 6 million was in cash, while more than 17.5 million was entirely in banknotes. Therefore, combining the previously mentioned issued amount with the current amount stored in the banks, the total is nearly 96 million yuan, not far from 100 million yuan. (November 19th)</p>
<p>Xiangshan Orphanage Walking Petition Group Passes Through Jinan on Their Way to Beijing</p>
<h3 id="e65">Appealing for Prompt Allocation of Funds <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Due to financial difficulties at the Xiangshan Orphanage in Beiping, students have elected ten representatives to depart from Beiping and walk to Beijing to petition. They arrived in Jinan at 10:00 AM today (21st). The ten representatives are Guo Chunxi, Peng Sichun, Ma Zhishuo, Wang Wenqing, Lei Dong, Shen Liansen, Xiao Yuelan, Zheng Dairu, Hou Bing, and Wang Changnian. Due to the long journey, their faces were covered in dust. According to the representatives, they departed from Beiping on the 28th of last month, traveling seventy to eighty li each day. At first, their feet were sore, but in the past two days, they have no longer felt the pain. When they reached the Hebei shore, fearing danger on the Yellow River Bridge, they took a car from Dezhou to Jinan. Since there are Shandong students in the orphanage, they must petition the Education Department in Jinan. After three to five days, they will continue walking south. The representative group is carrying an official letter from the orphanage, which they are presenting to various organizations along the way. The letter reads: "Respectfully, the students of our orphanage have elected representatives Guo Chunxi, Peng Sichun, Ma Zhishuo, Wang Wenqing, Lei Dong, Shen Liansen, Xiao Yuelan, Zheng Dairu, Hou Bing, and Wang Changnian to form a walking petition group to go to Nanjing to petition the central government for the allocation of funds. They started on foot from Beiping and are traveling more than two thousand li southward along the Jinpu Railway. Fearing that they may be unfamiliar with the local customs and encounter difficulties, they respectfully request that the military, police, political, and academic organizations in Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces treat them kindly, provide guidance, and assist them in ensuring their safety along the way. Please affix an official seal to the end of the letter for verification. With deepest respect, the Xiangshan Orphanage." In addition, there is an official letter from the orphanage's Teacher-Student School Maintenance Association, a declaration from the orphanage's student walking petition group, and a speedy mail representative describing the orphanage's difficult situation and requesting that the government promptly allocate the supplementary fees and the outstanding months of funding in accordance with the established plan to ensure its survival.

<p>Bengbu Correspondence - Su County in northern Anhui has been affected by years of war and chaos, and bandits have gathered into gangs, causing great harm. The various districts are currently engaged in a major suppression of these bandit gangs. However, recently, more than a thousand defeated troops of Sun Dianying suddenly emerged in the border areas of Linhuan and Baishen in the northwestern townships of the county, fleeing from Yongcheng in eastern Henan and engaging in rampant looting. Upon receiving the report, the county government immediately telegraphed Bengbu to report the situation to the provincial Bandit Suppression Command and the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting that they send a large army to quickly suppress the bandits and maintain local security. Wei Zhanyuan, the magistrate of Su County, had gone to Suixi to suppress bandits and had not yet returned. Magistrate Tang, acting on his behalf, consulted with Director Ma of the Seventh Division Training Office stationed in Su County, who dispatched a team to suppress the bandits. He also ordered the troops stationed in Yongcheng to come east and flank them. A reply was sent to Magistrate Wei, requesting him to quickly lead his troops from Suixi to join the militia for a three-pronged encirclement and suppression, in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible.

<p>Guangzhou Captures and Executes 20 Communist Bandits</p>
<p>N雄 and Shaoguan Successively Uncover Five Organizations</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - Since the large-scale suppression of communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi, the Guangdong authorities have also ordered the military and police in various regions to secretly implement a state of alert, strictly guarding against communists, and inspecting gun permits. In Guangzhou, the Public Security Bureau recently uncovered a communist organization in a certain area, capturing 20 young communist bandits. After strict interrogation, they were sentenced to death. At around 5:00 PM on the 15th, the bureau dispatched two armored prison vans to escort them to the Honghuagang execution ground. Dozens of security team members were deployed along the way in cars for escort, and one supervising officer rode in a car at the rear. The situation was extremely serious. However, more than ten young male prisoners and several female prisoners in the prison vans sang songs along the way. Upon arriving at the execution ground, the security team members were divided to guard the area, and the prisoners were brought out one by one for execution by firing squad. The execution was completed at around 6:00 PM, and the team withdrew. In the Beijiang area, communist organizations have also been uncovered in N雄 and Shaoguan. Recently, Wu, the magistrate of N雄 County, reported that communist elements were hiding in Datang and Guozhu in the county. He immediately sent troops to search the villages near the area and found a large bundle of reactionary propaganda materials and several documents in the village houses. Several communist bandits were arrested on the spot and taken back to the county. The magistrate immediately telegraphed the provincial authorities for instructions. The authorities telegraphed back, ordering that the evidence against the confirmed criminals be executed on the spot, and the seized propaganda materials be sent for filing. Furthermore, the Third Independent Regiment of the Shaoguan garrison also uncovered several communist organizations in Shaoguan at the beginning of the month. Previously, the regimental commander received intelligence that the general communist organization in Dongjiang had sent dozens of elements from Wuhua and Xingning to Beijiang to collude with local communist bandits and take the opportunity to mobilize disreputable soldiers, plotting a riot on Sun Yat-sen's birthday. In addition to ordering strict precautions, the regiment secretly ordered its subordinates to play along, catching all the bandits at once. On the 8th, communist bandits arrived at a certain company headquarters in Shaoguan to mobilize more than ten soldiers, and a total of seven or eight communist bandits held a secret meeting in the company. The regiment headquarters discovered the meeting and immediately dispatched troops to surround the area, arresting more than twenty people and taking them to the regimental headquarters for interrogation. It was learned that the general communist organization was located at the Shaoguan North Gate Slaughterhouse. The next day (9th), the Third Independent Regiment again searched the address and found a large number of reactionary propaganda materials and more than thirty handguns at the general organization, arresting more than twenty criminals. After interrogation, it was learned that the communist bandits were sent by Dongjiang to incite soldiers and collude with local communists to seize a corner of Beijiang to respond to the Zhu and Peng factions in Hunan and Jiangxi. The regimental commander and the soldiers of the regiment remained calm and dispatched troops again the next day to disarm the machine gun company. On the 11th, another communist organization was uncovered at the South Gate, and the party's proposals and many anti-insurgency banners were found. A total of four organizations were uncovered in the past few days. Five principal offenders were arrested and executed outside the North Gate of Shaoguan City on the 14th. More than twenty remaining arrested bandits and more than ten suspects are still under interrogation, and efforts are being made to capture the fugitives to eliminate the roots. (November 18th)</p>
<p>The Trend of Relaxing the Ban on Silver Exports in Shantou</p>
<h3 id="e69">Inside Story: Originated from Speculation in Singapore Currency Notes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Last year, due to the remittance of silver by overseas Chinese in Nanyang, various banks in Shantou transported a large amount of cash from Shanghai for the purpose of exchanging silver notes. This year, due to the high gold prices, cash from rural areas has been absorbed and transported out, amounting to more than one thousand taels of silver per day. The use of cash has therefore become more widespread. The remaining cash in Shantou City is nearly ten million. The situation changes with the times, and things are not always abundant. As the prices of Nanyang rubber and tin have fallen, the exchange of notes in Shantou has sharply decreased. The cash hidden among the people is also almost exhausted. However, this large amount of cash is still in the Shantou market. There are more than three hundred silver exchange firms in Shantou, which, in addition to lending money at interest, also buy and sell Singapore notes, Hong Kong notes, and central bank notes. Recently, the trend of speculating in Singapore notes has become very popular, and the market is like a drunkard. Guangxing Zhuang is the leader of the buyers, and Jiacheng Zhuang is the leader of the sellers. The daily trading volume reaches more than one million yuan. The buyers benefit from rising prices, while the sellers benefit from falling prices. Each side tries its best to manipulate the market due to their conflicting interests. The lifting of the ban on silver exports is a quick way to succeed in selling Singapore notes. Because exporting silver to Hong Kong and Xiamen can bring a profit of twenty yuan per thousand yuan, the cash in the market is depleted, and the daily interest rate can be increased. Since the ban was lifted, the daily interest rate has risen from eight percent to twenty-four percent in just a few days. After the silver supply is shaken, many merchants sell notes to be exchanged elsewhere, and the price of the notes will inevitably fall, which is another benefit for silver firms. As the price of notes falls everywhere, the price of Singapore notes will inevitably decrease, and the buyers will suffer significant losses. The advantages and disadvantages of commercial warfare are such that anyone with basic economic knowledge can see it, but the authorities are ignorant and do not understand. Therefore, since the ban was lifted, Jiacheng, Yucheng, Hongkang, Jiade, and other firms have been exporting hundreds of thousands of yuan every day. More than ten merchants selling Shantou, Suzhou, Guangdong, northern and southern seafood have sent telegrams of opposition, and newspapers have published articles criticizing them. Many silver firms secretly laugh because they have achieved great success within a dozen days of the ban being lifted, and it does not matter if the ban is reimposed. Seeing that the trend of exporting silver is like a river flowing downhill, Luo Zongmeng, the Customs Superintendent, has ordered that anyone transporting more than five thousand yuan of silver must obtain a passport before being allowed to export it, slightly restricting it. The rise of these trends and opposition from the southern economic community is very significant and cannot be ignored. (17th)</p>
<p>British Sailing Ship "Corley" Encountered Danger</p>
<h3 id="e70">Ran Aground Outside Shantou Harbor <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<h3 id="e71">Two Englishmen Rescued by Fishing Boat <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Europeans and Americans are brave and curious. Anyone who has read "Robinson Crusoe" or "Newspaper Reporter" can understand this. Last month, a wealthy British merchant from Tianjin named Moore-Murong, with tens of millions of assets and nearly ancient age, with gray hair and beard, still wanted to brave the waves and explore the Chinese coastline. Mr. Moore specially made a large sailing ship named "Corley." The ship was forty-six feet long and twelve feet wide, with two masts that could hoist sails and sail along the coastline. The ship was divided into six cabins, storing sufficient food and supplies. The entire ship was manufactured to be extremely sturdy and skillful. On October 1st, he set off from Tianjin with a navigator (also British). On the 20th, he arrived safely outside Wusongkou, Shanghai. On the 23rd, he departed from Shanghai and headed south, intending to reach Guangzhou Bay or Guangzhou as the final destination. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at the Xiamen sea area, the rudder was suddenly damaged by the waves, but it could still barely support sailing. On November 5th, he sailed into the Xingyu area of Shantou's territorial waters. This area is surrounded by mountains with hidden reefs, which have always been the location of shipwrecks. The "Corley" could not avoid this, and the ship's hull hit sharp reefs, and the entire ship sank. Fortunately, there were fishing boats fishing in groups in the area, and the two Englishmen were rescued by the fishermen. On the 9th, they were brought to Shantou. Moore-Murong and the other were exposed to the wind and sun, their faces were dark, their beards were messy, and their clothes were torn. Those who saw them almost thought they were beggars. Moore and others went to see the Customs Commissioner of Shantou Customs and told him the situation. The Customs Commissioner then learned that he was a giant merchant with courage and bravery. He then helped them stay at the Wolong Hotel in front of the Customs and telegraphed their firm in Tianjin to remit money to Shantou to welcome them back. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Recent Situation and Preliminary Plans for the Longhai Railway (Continued) <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Work Status (1) Status of the Project: The completed route extends from Dapu in the east to Lingbao in the west, a total of 825 kilometers. Due to the incomplete equipment during the construction period and the frequent turbulent situation over the years, the project has been greatly affected. The project funds are insufficient, and the materials are lacking. The condition of the tracks is deteriorating day by day. The 88 kilometers from the 452nd kilometer east of Xin'anzhen to Dapu have not yet been laid with ballast. The rails and sleepers are directly laid on the soil base, which has been for more than four years. The sleepers are extremely easy to rot, and there is a danger of driving. It has been delayed until now and urgently needs to be rectified. In addition, the protection dike project between the Grand Canal and Haizhou has not yet been carried out. Moreover, since the 15th year of the Republic of China, there have been very few replacements of sleepers along the road. According to the latest survey, there are about 210,000 decayed sleepers on the entire line, accounting for 25% of the total number of sleepers. Although the current driving speed is strictly limited, the possibility of danger still exists and needs to be planned. (2) Equipment along the Road: The equipment on this line is simple due to the unfinished project. The signal shapes and turnout signals that should be available at each station have not been installed. The equipment for locomotive water supply is also incomplete. Water supply is already lacking in peacetime, and military transportation is even more difficult. The equipment such as mileage and gradient signs along the road is even more irrelevant. (3) Damage from the War: Since the Northwest Army retreated from Xishan west to Luoyang in May, more than thirty large and small bridges along the line have been bombed. Only more than ten small bridges have been officially repaired. The rest are temporarily built with temporary detours or supported with sleepers and wooden frames to facilitate traffic. During this campaign against the rebels, fighting has been going on along the line for more than six months, from February 8th to October 10th. Seventy-six bridges have been bombed. The number of rails, sleepers, and turnout devices at various stations that have been dismantled and bombed along the way is even more difficult to count. About a dozen houses have been destroyed along the way, and the houses at Minquan Station have been completely destroyed. The amount of damage and the size of the loss are estimated to be over one million. (4) Preparation and Restoration of Engineering Materials: The materials for this line were extremely scarce. As soon as the current military affairs began, an engineering train was organized to load all the required materials and tools, and a hundred experienced workers were selected and led by the supervisor to advance with the army. On the one hand, it was negotiated with the Jinpu Railway to transfer 15,000 sleepers. Later, funds were raised to purchase 9,560 sleepers from Mitsui Yangxing. Finally, Jinpu was entrusted to purchase 10,000 foreign pine sleepers. Fortunately, this material repair project was not delayed. Steel rails, turnouts, and other items were temporarily borrowed from the Western Route Engineering Bureau to meet emergency needs. The remaining scattered materials were either purchased locally or self-made by the road in order to avoid delaying the repair project. (5) Situation of Repair: The engineering train organized by this line has always been advancing with the army. Any damage is repaired immediately. Sometimes, even under the line of fire, they work at night and without stopping, never delaying military affairs. All bombed rails and turnouts have been replaced. The destroyed bridges are temporarily supported with sleepers. Steel beams that hinder traffic are either sawed or dismantled to ensure that traffic can be restored in the shortest possible time. The repairs between Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are even faster. Two or three hours after the recapture of Zhengzhou, the engineering vehicle repaired along the road in the rain of bullets and bombs, and bravely advanced, so it was able to reach the station first. Now the rails and bridges between Zhengzhou and Lingbao have also been repaired and will be open to traffic immediately.</p>
<p>Vehicle Operations (1) Situation in the Initial Period: In February of this year, all the vehicles on this line were seized by Han Shiren's and other departments, and less than twenty vehicles could be freely used. After repeated negotiations, about 280 vehicles were returned one after another. In addition to those requisitioned by the Transportation Headquarters for military use, the most for this line's business was about 100 vehicles, and the least was only 20 to 30 vehicles. On average, about 50 to 60 vehicles were used to maintain operations for several months. (2) Situation of Military Transportation: Military transportation lasted only nine months from February to October. The return of the army must be completed in November, which is not yet included. During wartime, due to strategic relations, whether advancing or retreating, the busyness of transportation is indescribable. In August and September, the number of military trains reached more than 490 times. In total, from February to the end of September, a total of 2,667 military trains were operated, totaling 227,619 train kilometers. (3) Situation of Passenger Transport: The first and second passenger and freight trains between Xuzhou and Dapu have been operating normally since February. Only two third-class passenger cars are attached, and a number of freight cars are attached to facilitate the flow of goods. The order in this section is still good because there is no war. The third and fourth passenger and freight trains west of Xuzhou opened to Neihuang in February, to Minquan in March, to Dangshan in April, and to Shangqiu from May to September. From October 7th, they resumed their original status and opened to Zhengzhou. From October 14th, the fifth and sixth passenger and freight trains between Zhengzhou and Luoyang operated as usual. However, since military transportation has not yet completely ended, it is difficult to accurately determine the train schedule. In total, passenger transport revenue from February to the end of September was about 120,000 yuan. (4) Situation of Freight Transport: Since the outbreak of the war, traffic has been blocked, and the source of goods west of Shangqiu has been cut off. The maintenance relies on the export of wheat, peanuts, and other miscellaneous grains from Dangshan, Huangkou, Tongshan, Xuzhou, and other stations. The imports are miscellaneous goods from Dapu. The salt from Huaibei is transported by sea to Nankou and then transported by the Jinpu Railway to Bengbu. In order to facilitate merchants, a method of transporting salt directly to Bengbu was planned and approved by the Ministry. Since the implementation of this method, it only takes twenty hours from Haizhou to Bengbu, and merchants praise it. In total, from February to the end of September, 128 full freight trains were operated, 16 trains of Zhongxing coal were operated, and 23 trains of salt were operated, totaling 27,884 train kilometers, with a revenue of about 800,000 yuan. (5) Matters that Urgently Need to be Rectified and Equipped: This line has huge debts and simple equipment. After this period of military affairs, the trauma is even deeper. If we do not urgently seek to rectify and increase revenue, how can we fund the injection? On the vehicle operations side, the current plans include: 1. Restoring the special express train between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou and the passenger and freight trains on the entire line. 2. Unblocking accumulated goods and absorbing new goods, focusing on eliminating malpractices and providing convenience. 3. Rectifying and equipping the telegraph and telephone lines on the entire line. 4. Installing electric and gas line signs to ensure traffic safety. These are all symptomatic treatments. As for the fundamental method, the plan will be determined after the overall plan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Regulations of the Anti-Opium Association on the Method of Burning Opium <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Central Anti-Opium Committee previously approved a letter from the Jinling Customs Salt Supervision Office stating that from October 1st to November 4th of this year, a total of 4,980 taels of opium and 128 taels of fake opium drugs were seized. It was decided to publicly burn them at Xiaguan on November 8th and requested to send personnel to supervise. The committee then sent staff member Yang Shusheng as a representative to supervise. According to the reply, the representatives of various agencies weighed the opium in person on that day and found that the opium was genuine. The genuine opium, including the wrapping, weighed 345 catties, excluding 15 catties, the net weight of the opium was 330 catties, equivalent to 5,280 taels, which was more than 300 taels more than the above number. There was deep suspicion, and the representative of the customs was immediately asked. According to the statement, the customs estimated that the weight of the wrapping was about 4,980 taels when it was seized, checked, weighed, and estimated by the customs. It was found that this kind of estimate has no fixed standard and is very likely to cause malpractices. The committee believes that the opium seized in various places is usually checked, weighed, and sealed by the responsible personnel before being publicly burned to show fairness. The customs' method of estimating the removal of packaging has no fixed standard and is prone to malpractices. Therefore, yesterday, a letter was sent to the Jinling Customs Superintendent requesting that the seized opium should be weighed, sealed, and stored by the responsible personnel without estimating the removal of the paper skin to show the truth. When it is scheduled to be burned, the representatives of various agencies will check the seal, open it, supervise the weighing, and then burn it to show great trust.</p>

<p>The bandit forces in Xiongyuan and other places are secretly growing. Xiongyuan Town in Punan is located in the border area between Songjiang and Jinshan counties. In the past, the Communist bandits were entrenched here and emerged to cause trouble, making the people in nearby villages uneasy. Later, they were wiped out and pacified by the Provincial Police Brigade, together with the local naval and land police. Although the Communist bandits have now converged, the bandits are still active. According to custom, farmers are exempted from several taxes when they pay rent at the time of returning rent and opening warehouses to show encouragement. The time for opening warehouses this year has arrived. It is heard that bandits are looting everywhere, claiming to be bandits flying to limit the rent that farmers should pay. The bandits have learned about it clearly. The bandits openly notified household by household to pay in the Xiongyuan area, and looting has been happening from time to time in recent days. The victims dare not report it, not only because they are afraid of the bandits' retaliation.</p>

<p>Holding the Third National Goods Mobile Exhibition: The Suzhou National Goods Relief Association and other three organizations have launched the Third National Goods Mobile Exhibition, inviting national goods factories in Shanghai to participate in Suzhou. It is scheduled to be held on December 1st. The Suzhou Chamber of Commerce has submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to issue free transport orders so that the factories in Shanghai can transport exhibition items. However, these transport orders have not yet been issued, so the National Goods Relief Association has sent a special envoy to Beijing to negotiate with the factories in Shanghai as the opening date is approaching. The Shanghai manufacturers have jointly recommended Tu Jiean and Chen Yiting to come to Suzhou immediately to negotiate everything. But in fact, the opening date of December 1st may not be possible and may have to be postponed for ten days. As for the participating factories, there are about 50 factories in Shanghai and about 30 factories in Suzhou.</p>

<p>Robbery on a Boat at Gaoqiaokou:范迪训, a resident of Yanqiao Town, Fifth District (Tianshang City), needed to go to Luoshe on urgent business the night before. He took Chen Jiquan's barge from the town. While passing Gaoqiaokou, in the Panfeng area, they were suddenly approached by a boat from which seven or eight robbers jumped, brandishing pistols and flashlights, and ordered them to stop. Chen Jiquan, fearing an accident, had to stop the boat. The robbers immediately boarded the boat and searched it thoroughly, but found nothing. Enraged, the robbers drove Chen Jiquan, the boatman, Zhu Jinbao, and the passenger, Fan Dixun, ashore, declaring that they would borrow the boat and return it there at dawn. Otherwise, they would kill them. With that, the robbers sailed the boat towards Wujin.</p>
<p>Siyi Road Regular Conscription Labor Begins: The Siyi Road construction project, undertaken by the county's Construction Bureau Director Yao Xinyi, is actively preparing plans and budgets.

<p>Soil Traffickers Detained and Fined, Then Released: Huangtiangang Port, outside the North Gate, is a key thoroughfare for the Yangtze River, both upstream and downstream. The trafficking of opium is an open secret. Several seizures have been made this year, totaling 1400 catties, all transported to various ports in Jiangsu Province. The other day, Zhou Furong and Liu Kunsheng, stewards on the Dehe Steamer, transported 900 catties of opium intending to unload it in Nantong. However, several Jiangyin traffickers wanted to unload it in Cheng County. The stewards, wary of repeated incidents in Jiangyin, refused. The traffickers paid over 1,000 yuan in guarantees, and the stewards dumped the opium into the river. The ship sailed to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the opium was discovered near Qiyu Port by a small vessel (affiliated with an unspecified organization). The traffickers were powerless to resist. Liu Fulao and others from the Dehe Steamer in Shanghai learned the news and came to Cheng County on the 18th to demand the opium from the traffickers, including Ge Laosi. On that day, a group of traffickers from other regions were gambling at Ge's house in Hexi when Cui Siping, chief of the First Public Security Precinct outside the North Gate, learned of it. He sent police to search Ge's house for opium but found nothing. He then took Ge Laosi and Chen Laoliu (both traffickers) to the precinct. After intervention from Shen Rongzhi, Cui fined the traffickers, 周福榮, etc., 55 yuan each, and Chen Laoliu 30 yuan each, releasing them on the night of the 19th. The matter was kept secret, and the Public Security Bureau and the County Government only learned of it yesterday. An investigation is planned.</p>
<p>Escaped Prisoner Apprehended in Shanghai and Escorted to Cheng County: Wu Biao of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team learned on the 13th in Yongxing Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, that Zhu A'si (alias Wu Hongmou, also known as A'wu) and Xie Peizhi (alias Chun Geng) and two women, Jiang Jiaojiao and Zhu Shundi, from Zhulangzhong Bridge, Xixiang, Jiangyin, were hiding there. Zhu had committed a counter-revolutionary crime, robbing a cattle merchant of silver dollars and killing him, and was imprisoned but escaped on January 31st. This year, he participated in the Hong Kong robbery and assault on a police officer, and plotted to attack Cao Xiang, the chief of the Sixth District. Detective Wu immediately coordinated with the Fourth District Public Security to arrest them and escort them to the main bureau. He telegraphed the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau, and Detective Team Leader Yang Bingwei took a warrant to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. According to Jiang Jiaojiao and Zhu Shundi, they were kidnapped by Zhu A'si and others in Zheng Dashu, Changzhou. They were sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for temporary care and the Wujin County Government was notified to investigate and summon the families of the women to the bureau to claim them. Zhu A'si and Xie Peizhi were handed over to Team Leader Yang and escorted to Cheng County on the 20th. Yang saw Xu Yourong, who was involved in the Jiangyin bandit case, at the North Station and also escorted him to Cheng County on the 21st. Today (the 22nd), they were separately handed over by the Public Security Bureau to the county for secret interrogation by Judge Yang Cheng and then ordered to be detained.</p>

<p>County Police Team Captures Bandits and Seizes Weapons: Chen Qingxun, the captain of the Second Police Platoon stationed in Luzhuang County, led a team on patrol in the area of Dongxi Yanzhuang and Shangfang Shuidongkou.</p>
<p>According to a secret report, the large bandits from Jiangyin were secretly active in the area. The team immediately apprehended the four members of the bandit army's Red Guard: Mei Bohong (artilleryman), Sun Wanlin (artilleryman), Shen Mingjun (transportation committee member), and Zhang Zhushan (communist party organizing committee member) near Shangfang Shuidongkou. They also seized two Mauser pistols, six homemade cannons, and three bicycles. Afterwards, a public lecture was held at Dongxi Yanzhuang, explaining why the Communist Party could not stand under the banner of the Kuomintang. The people immediately became aware and expressed their willingness to surrender, handing over 226 small knives and six broadswords. In the afternoon, the team returned to the garrison and interrogated the captured bandits. They confessed to secretly returning from Jiangnan to plot an uprising and to be responsible for various tasks for the bandit party. On the afternoon of the 19th, the team captain handed over Sun Wanlin and the other bandits, along with the homemade cannons and Mauser pistols, to the county brigade headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Issue of Reorganizing County Roads: Nantong County's roads have a total length of over 600 miles. In recent years, they have not been repaired for a long time, and the roadbeds have collapsed and many bridges have become dilapidated. The County Administrative Conference decided that the Construction Bureau should immediately invite the relevant district chiefs to discuss the matter. The County Government specially ordered Director Yao to handle the matter. Local circles expressed great dissatisfaction that the Construction Bureau has as many as fifty employees but has not immediately repaired the county roads.</p>

<p>Decision to Convert Field Rent at Market Price: This autumn, the conversion of rent payments by tenants in this county was initially determined by the party-government talks to be nine yuan per picul. Later, as the market price suddenly soared, the party-government meeting reduced the price to eight yuan. However, the market price has gradually increased again, and according to the annual custom, the rent price has never been reduced. Therefore, the landlords have repeatedly requested the county government to reconsider. As a result, the county government has not issued a formal announcement, and the landlords' rent collection has also been inconsistent, causing many tenants to wait and see. Yesterday (the 21st), the county administrative conference decided to comply with the instructions of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Since the rent regulations already stipulate that the rent should be converted at the market price, there is no need to add any restrictions. Based on this clause, it was decided to convert the rent at the market price. An official announcement was issued and sent to the County Party Department for reference.</p>
<p>Preparations for County Middle School Games Almost Lead to Tragedy: The county middle school in this county will soon hold its own sports meet. A track was hastily built on the school playground. The school allocated 80 yuan to the physical education instructor, Shen Zhongguang, to purchase cinders and pave the track. The school also borrowed a heavy iron roller from the Construction Bureau to level the track. On the afternoon of the other day, during physical education class, Zhong Jizhong, a boarding student from Mao Village, and others were pushing and pulling the iron roller for fun. Instructor Shen immediately grabbed the iron handle along with student Zhou and ordered more than ten students to push it from behind. As they approached the wall, they needed to retreat. Suddenly, the students in front exerted too much force, and those retreating could not move quickly enough. Zhou Jizhong hesitated slightly and was tripped. The iron roller rolled over Zhou. The iron roller, which was used by the Construction Bureau for building provincial roads, weighed about a thousand pounds. Fortunately, it tilted slightly, so it only injured Zhou's head and buttocks. A hole was torn in his head, and blood flowed non-stop. Someone reported to the principal, Xu Yunyuan, who rushed the student to Jishan Hospital for treatment. The head injury was reported to be more serious than the buttock injury. Fortunately, his life was not in danger. The school games were originally scheduled for the 19th, but after this incident, the school authorities announced that the games would be temporarily suspended and rescheduled.</p>

<p>Former County Public Security Bureau Chief Accused: Judgement in Case Announced: Xu Ajin, a servant at Nanyuan Hall in Jiaxing, was previously forced to serve as a porter by the police, causing his family to starve. After being released by the army upon request, he accused Qiu Zeshen, the current chief of the Second Public Security Precinct, Mo Runxun, the former chief of the County Public Security Bureau, and Fang Zhuangyou, the former secretary of the County Government, of ordering the police to use violence to force people to perform involuntary labor. The High Court designated the Hangzhou Court to hear the case, and the court summoned witnesses for questioning multiple times. Xu Ajin specially hired lawyers Gu Shaoming, Cao Tinglan, Wu Shufang, Chen Dexin, Yu Linquan, and others to represent him pro bono. The debate was concluded a few days ago, and the verdict was announced yesterday. The Hangzhou Court, considering that the defendants were somewhat hasty but not entirely at fault, acquitted them. However, Xu Ajin was very dissatisfied after the hearing and prepared to appeal after receiving the judgment.</p>
<p>Robbery Occurs Outside the North Gate: At around 10 p.m. on the 22nd, a group of six or seven bandits armed with weapons suddenly broke into the home of Shi, a monk, in Shijia Bang, Taiping Bridge, outside Jiaxing's North Gate. They tied up Shi, the monk, and severely beat his son, then looted the place at will. The area is very close to the city. Someone reported the incident to the Third Public Security Precinct, which relayed the information to the military and police agencies. The Second District Department, the Shui Guan County Public Security Bureau, the patrol police brigade, the business association and other armed forces rushed to pursue them, but the bandits had already left without a trace.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Ministry of Education Stipulates Distinct Names for Schools <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to all provinces and municipalities stipulating the names of schools jointly run by several counties. The original order stated:</p>
<p>It is necessary to clearly distinguish school names based on the source of funding and the nature of the school. However, recent investigations have revealed that in addition to the four types of public schools – National, Provincial, Municipal, and County – there is also a type jointly established by several counties, with funding allocated by several counties or from shared property rentals. This type of school is not solely owned by one county and should not be called "X County Public." To clearly distinguish it, a distinct name should be stipulated in addition to the four types of public school names: National, Provincial, Municipal, and County. It is now stipulated that this distinct name will be "Jointly Established." In the future, all schools jointly established by two locations will be called "XX (abbreviation of the two locations) Jointly Established X School." If the school is jointly established by three or more locations, the first character of the school name can be taken to summarize the locations involved. After this stipulation, all previous names such as "XX United County Public School" or "XX Several County Public X School" should be uniformly corrected.</p>
<p>In addition to issuing separate orders, it is also urgently ordered that each county investigate the schools under its jurisdiction that need to have their names corrected and order them to make the corrections and report them to the Ministry. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session Approved the Establishment of a Specialized Translation Bureau to Translate</p>
<h3 id="e91">Academic Books from Various Countries <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>At the Fourth Plenary Session, Zhu Jiahua proposed the "Motion to Establish a Specialized Translation Bureau to Translate Academic Books from Various Countries to Popularize New Knowledge to the Nation and to Promote Academic Communication with Various Countries," which was approved in principle and submitted to the National Government for consideration by the Ministry of Education. The original proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>All endeavors are rooted in academics. Academic excellence in other countries is the reason for the revitalization of all aspects. Academic deficiencies in China are the reason why various construction projects are difficult to perfect. Books are the expression of academics and the stepping stones to research. Academic books in other countries are abundant, while in China they are scarce. It is imperative to establish a specialized translation bureau to oversee translation work in order to promote academic research. The positive and negative reasons are outlined below:</p>
<p>China is indeed lacking in research talent, and even those who wish to engage in research have few books to read. There are three reasons for this: (1) They are scattered in various countries and difficult to collect. (2) Different countries have different languages, and those who know one language may not know another. (3) Foreign books are too expensive to purchase easily. Recognizing this, the Japanese made translating Western books their initial approach. Every relatively important book published in the world is immediately translated into Japanese. Not only can it be popularized among the people of their country in writing, but its price is also much cheaper than the original book, which arouses the interest of scholars in their country and encourages them to engage in more in-depth exploration.</p>
<p>Opponents may argue that Japanese translations are mostly done by private individuals on their own initiative and are not entirely controlled by the government. There are now occasional publications of translated books in Chinese bookstores. As long as there is a demand for research, there will naturally be a supply of translations. Why should the government set up a special office to handle this non-urgent matter? This argument seems valid, but it is not. If we look at the newly published materials in bookstores, which are more numerous, academic books or non-academic books? Merchants are profit-oriented and only know how to cater to trends and do not know how to promote trends. Specialized academic books are less needed in China now. They should be actively promoted by the government and should not be allowed to develop naturally. This is precisely what our party aims for: when learning from foreign countries, we must catch up from the beginning and not follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>Measures: 1. Establish a translation office in the central government and attach a library. In addition to purchasing old famous works from various countries, purchase or exchange new academic publications at any time to ensure that they are collected in detail without any omissions. 2. In addition to being translated by the office itself, professors from domestic universities may be designated to assist in the translation of books to be translated. 3. Private translations may be submitted to the office for review, and high prices may be paid to purchase them to show encouragement. 4. Order provinces and regions to establish libraries universally and purchase books published by the office for public reading in order to promote widespread dissemination. 5. Books published by the office may only charge printing costs in order to keep prices low and make them accessible to the public. 6. The office will regularly review and determine academic terms so that the terms used by translators can be standardized. Are the above-mentioned reasons and measures appropriate? Please make a public decision. Proposer: Zhu Jiahua Co-signer: Chen Lifu</p>

In places where consulates have been established, the seals of registered Chinese schools should be issued by the consul and reported to the Ministry for the record in order to ensure uniformity and convenience. In addition to issuing separate orders, the Ministry hereby orders you to be informed and to instruct your subordinate schools to comply.

<p>The National Jinan University's studies on the Three Principles of the People have been repeatedly advocated by Principal Zheng in recent years. However, due to the need for meticulous preparation of a concrete organization, the process has been slightly delayed. Now, the steps for implementation have been finalized, and group studies are divided into: A. Three Principles of the People Group, B. Psychological Construction Group, C. Material Construction Group, D. Social Construction Group, E. Nation-Building Outline Group, F. Other Groups. Detailed regulations exist for the organization, meetings, and publication methods of each group. Furthermore, a display room for books on the Three Principles of the People has been designated in the library. Also, the school's October salary checks have been issued, and all departments are proceeding in an orderly manner, showing great discipline. However, the middle school department still needs improvement. This morning, during Memorial Week, Principal Zheng visited the school and delivered an address, also reporting on plans for improvement to thoroughly implement the school's mission of educating overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>Lehua Still Lost Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e104">Lost to Lakers Zero to Two; Better Morale Than Before <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<h3 id="e105">With Cao Guicheng and Chen Yutian Joining <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Lehua soccer team had Cao Guicheng and Chen Yutian joining yesterday, marking a renewal of spirit, completely unlike before. Although the result was a 0-2 loss to Lakers in the Group A match, their actual strength was not far apart.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Cao Guicheng's Reputation Well-Deserved <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Cao Guicheng of South China is the only right-winger of talent in our country. This time, he came to Shanghai on business and happened to encounter the Lehua vs. Lakers match. He played as an experienced team member to serve the fans in Shanghai. Admiration for his name had been long-standing, and once the news spread, spectators flocked to Shen Garden in numbers rarely seen before. When Li Huitang and Cao Guicheng walked onto the field, the applause was deafening and the welcome was intense, as one can imagine. Mr. Cao lived up to his name. In the intense battle of ninety minutes, he was very effective, almost never failing to make an impact, becoming a dangerous figure among Lehua's forwards. The enemy feared him as if facing a fierce tiger, avoiding his attack. After swapping positions with Chen Yutian, he was also able to handle it with ease. His teammate Chen Yutian was also an outstanding talent. The opportunities created by both were not capitalized upon due to insufficient support from the midfield; otherwise, Lakers' goal would have been hard-pressed to avoid being breached.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Lu Zhong'en Gets His Wish <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the battle, Cao Guicheng, showing his mettle, was eager to try. The enemy, having heard of his name long ago, feared him like a tiger. Whenever he dribbled forward, they would kick the ball out of bounds, rendering the hero useless. Within five minutes, an opportunity suddenly arose, and Lehua gained a corner kick. Cao kicked powerfully, landing the ball in front of the goal. The goalkeeper caught it but lost it again. With no one else around, it was safely cleared. Then, Lakers' right-winger, Matt, shot at the goal. Lu Zhong'en calmly caught the ball and kicked it to Li Huitang, who passed it again to Chen Yutian. The three passed the ball to Cao Guicheng, who fiercely attacked the goal. Several midfielders crowded in, and goalkeeper Roberts leapt up to punch the ball out, averting the danger for Lakers. But Lehua's danger reappeared, as Lakers took advantage of the internal weakness of Lehua, and five tigers pounced. Lu Zhong'en, seeing the opportunity, decisively left the goal from afar, hoping to turn the tide. A long shot from thirty yards away saved the day, fulfilling his wish.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Simon's Shot Breaks Through <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Lakers' siege had taken shape. The five forwards either attacked from the left and right flanks or directly from the center, causing Lehua's internal defense to be stretched in all directions, creating a dangerous situation. The second corner kick was safely defended. Subsequently, left-winger Jackson crossed the ball, and center forward Simon lifted his foot, shooting with full force. Lu Zhong'en met the shot with one hand, but could not stop it from rolling into the goal, and the goal was breached. This occurred twenty-five minutes into the game. Cao and Chen made several excellent crosses, but unfortunately, the midfielders on the left were not very effective, making the efforts futile. Li Huitang kicked a free kick, but the goalkeeper caught it. Zhang Baoluo charged and fell to the ground, and no one followed up, resulting in a missed opportunity. In the next ten minutes, Lehua was subjected to even greater pressure. It was a great storm, but fortunately, no danger was encountered. Soon after, Lehua launched a counterattack, with repeated advances being blocked. Chen Yutian penetrated deep into the flank and lifted his right foot, landing the ball right in front of the goal. Yang Renwei headed the ball, but it went high above the goal, causing the audience to sigh in disappointment. In the first half, Lakers led with a score of 1-0.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Li Huitang's Amazing Shot <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>As the second half resumed, Cao Guicheng became very active. Within two minutes, he had passed the foul line and entered the danger zone. The entire Lakers team lost color, behaving coarsely and being penalized for fouls. Li Huitang took the free kick from about twenty-five yards from the goal. He shot directly at the goal, and with a loud bang, the ball missed by only a foot, startling everyone. Lakers reorganized and counterattacked fiercely, probing the goal twice. One attempt was blocked by Lu's body, and the other went high behind the goal. Li Huitang provided strong support, and Chen Yutian rushed forward again on the right. He chipped the ball over inside defender Wu Jianhai, facing an empty goal. Who knew that the handling would be improper, turning all hope into smoke.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Tommy Gets It Without Effort <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Lehua's main player, Li Huitang, realizing that the attack force of the forwards was uneven on the left and right, changed the formation, personally taking the central forward position, while Wu Jianhai was moved to left midfielder, and Wang Jihua was reassigned to central defender. The forwards subsequently made several amazing moves. However, the opportunities for counterattack were minimal, and the internal defense was chaotic due to the loss of a pillar. Half of the team's territory was ravaged by others. Fortunately, Lakers' shooting technique was poor; otherwise, even with Lu's good defense, Lehua could not have guaranteed avoiding trouble. In the final five minutes, Lakers' Matt chipped the ball to the center. Wang Shusen kicked the ball against the goalpost, and it bounced back in front of Tommy, who headed it into the net. Lehua redoubled its efforts, hoping to recover a goal or two, but the situation was irreversible, and time was running out. As a result, Lehua lost to Lakers 0-2. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing.</p>

<p>Zhenru won against Qingnian (Middle Group). The Zhenru team is very strong and has high hopes of winning the Middle Group championship. However, the Qingnian team is also a rising force, formed by players from both Fudan and Shanghai-Jiangnan Universities. Players like Hu Minteng, Qu Hongde, and Yu Shunzhang are quite well-known. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the two teams faced off at the Chinese baseball field, with He Chunhui as the referee. Qingnian's momentum was extremely strong, invading Zhenru's area, charging left and right, with sharp offense. Right-winger Zhu Xiaorong's passing was effective, and left-winger Yao Yongbing relayed from the middle to right forward Zhou Shaowen, who lifted his foot and scored, opening the scoring. Zhenru quickly counterattacked, questioning the opponent, and a dangerous situation formed in front of Qingnian's goal. Zhenru's center forward, Luo Haixian, got the ball and scored, and the momentum grew stronger. After a few minutes, Zhenru's Luo Haixian scored a second time, making the score 2-1 in Zhenru's favor in the first half. At the start of the second half, Qingnian tried to retaliate, but Zhenru also showed no weakness. After a short stalemate, Zhenru suddenly became courageous, surrounding Qingnian's goal. Qingnian's defender, Qu Hongde, became the target of attack, struggling to cope. Fortunately, he was agile and able to defuse the danger. Qingnian then launched an invasion, but Zhenru was well-prepared and impenetrable. After more than twenty minutes, Zhenru's left forward, Cai Rongrui, on the left wing, sent a long ball in front of Qingnian's goal, unexpectedly breaking through and scoring, causing the spectators to laugh. In the next ten or so minutes, Zhenru's Luo Haixian scored two more goals. Qingnian's disorganized defense failed to achieve anything. As a result, Zhenru won 5-1.</p>
<p>Zhendan drew with Baota (Middle Group). The Zhendan team consists not only of Chinese players but also several Western players. The team fought Baota yesterday at the track and field, and the two teams were evenly matched and difficult to separate. After an intense battle, neither side scored. The referee was Tang Zhongguang.</p>

<p>Vice-Commander Zhang Also Scheduled to Go North at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui went to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss important official matters. He returned to Shanghai only the morning before yesterday. As reported yesterday, reporters visited him and learned that Chairman Chiang's trip to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits is expected to take place at the end of this month. He is scheduled to stay for two weeks and then return to Nanjing to handle affairs. Vice-Commander Zhang is also unable to leave Nanjing for the time being because the issue of incorporating the remnants of Yan and Feng's forces still needs to be thoroughly discussed with Chairman Chiang. Therefore, his trip north is also expected to be around the end of the month.</p>
<p>National Calendar Settlement Issues</p>
<h3 id="e125">Various Industries Request Assistance from the Financial Sector <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Settling accounts at the end of the National Calendar year is inevitable. However, various industries such as soybean, rice, and native products are facing difficulties in collecting debts due to the inability of debtors to repay. Meanwhile, debts owed to the financial sector must be repaid in accordance with government orders. Furthermore, in order to meet sales targets and social demand, more goods must be prepared outside of the National Calendar year. As such, working capital is inevitably strained. Therefore, many advocate requesting that banks and money shops, after the settlement of accounts at the end of the National Calendar year, allow repayment of current accounts but also provide additional short-term loans (i.e., one or two months) for turnover. It is reported that the money shops find this request reasonable and may consider it.</p>

Upon his return to Nanjing this time, his first step will be to negotiate with him on the recovery of the French Concession Tribunal, and after making some progress, he will proceed with other negotiations.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Letters Were Sent Out</p>
<p>Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>The Central Bank Temporary Exchange Bondholders' Association sent letters yesterday to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Shops Association, the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, the Chambers of Commerce of various provinces, cities, and counties, and various organizations, requesting their unanimous sympathy and assistance. The letter stated: "To all whom it may concern, the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, with the approval of the National Government on August 26 of the 15th year of the Republic of China, entrusted the Political Affairs Bureau and the Treasury of the General Headquarters to issue Central Bank Temporary Exchange Bonds worth 5 million yuan in silver dollars. The bonds were divided into denominations of 1 yuan, 5 yuan, and 10 yuan, and were stamped with the seal of the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army and the official seals of the Director of the Political Affairs Bureau and the Treasurer. The General Headquarters formulated regulations and promulgated them, instructing that they be fully accepted and used. These exchange bonds once circulated in Shanghai, but were suddenly suspended from redemption, causing significant losses to merchants and civilians. Today, four years have passed, and merchants and civilians have repeatedly appealed to the government to recover and redeem them, but no appropriate solution has been found. The issuance of these exchange bonds was originally intended to subsidize the Northern Expedition, which was beneficial to the military affairs of the Northern Expedition. The National Government should recover and redeem them as soon as possible to alleviate the people's difficulties. Now that the military affairs have ended and the country is unified, the central government is striving to govern with diligence and renewing the country with the people. Domestic and foreign public debts are being consolidated as a whole, the country's prestige is increasing day by day, and the people's recovery is expected. The significance of the Central Bank Temporary Exchange Bonds is as important as stated above, and its nature is absolutely different from other domestic debts and cannot be compared with them. Therefore, the government must recover and redeem them in full as soon as possible.

<p>Petition to the Ministry of Finance to Recover National Treasury Bonds</p>
<h3 id="e128">Telegram to the Central Government <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The National Treasury Bondholders' Association of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government sent a petition yesterday to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "The Ministry of Finance, in order to subsidize the national treasury and regulate finance, issued National Treasury Bonds worth 9 million yuan on June 30 of the 16th year of the Republic of China. The bonds were divided into denominations of 1 yuan, 5 yuan, and 10 yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%. The Ministry of Finance formulated regulations and ordered their promulgation, issuing them in three installments over three months, with 3 million yuan issued each month. The bonds were to be redeemed by the national treasury six months after the date of issuance, and the bonds were marked with the words 'can be redeemed at the Central Bank of each province upon maturity.' These treasury bonds were fully issued and circulated, but time has passed, and they are now overdue by three years. Merchants and civilians holding the bonds have received neither principal nor interest, which has had a severe impact on people's livelihoods. Now that the situation is stable and the country is unified, the Ministry of Finance should promptly reorganize these national treasury bonds and order the Central Bank of each province to redeem them immediately to uphold government orders and maintain credibility. We humbly submit this petition and hope that you will consider and implement it, for the benefit of both the public and the people."</p>

<h3 id="e130">Unprecedented Bumper Harvest in Decades <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province May Have a Surplus of Six or Seven Million Shi</p>
<p>Next Year's Food Supply for the People is Expected to Be Worry-Free</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday presented a report to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, stating that the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, had forwarded a report from the Food Committee. After hearing the news of the bumper autumn harvest, the Committee instructed representatives of the food industry and various committee members to conduct investigations at any time for reference. According to the report from the food industry committee, all producing areas have reported a bumper harvest this year. In Jiangsu Province, areas that usually yield less than two shi per mu can yield three shi this year. Areas north of the Yangtze River that usually grow miscellaneous grains have also switched to rice cultivation this year. The situation in northern Huaihe is the same. Currently, the best japonica rice in Shanghai sells for 15-16 yuan per shi, which is 5-6 yuan lower than during the lean season this year, and there is still potential for further decline. Dujian rice sells for only a little over 10 yuan. Jiangxi indica rice sells for only 10.2 yuan per dan. One dan of milled white rice, which weighs 224 jin, costs only 5 yuan. Anhui rice production costs at most 8 yuan, and Hunan rice costs only 6 yuan. Furthermore, areas such as Si'an and Jiashan are blocked and have no place to sell their produce. Tianjin also had a good early rice harvest, which is estimated to be one million dan higher than in previous years. It is estimated that Jiangsu Province may have a surplus of six or seven million shi of rice. In addition, several rice ears were sent for inspection, and the largest ear had up to 209 grains, and the next largest had 170 grains. In addition to instructing them to continue investigating in the producing areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, it is believed that the committee members' reports are based on communications from firms in the producing areas and cannot be considered entirely accurate. However, based on rice prices and the rice ears sent for inspection, it is estimated that what they say is not entirely false. In ordinary years, a rice ear usually has 120-130 grains, and it is rare to see more than 140 grains. This year, the number of grains is not only more than that, but also up to 200 or more, which is a good omen. Because agricultural affairs in our country are not well-developed, the harvest depends entirely on the weather. It cannot be compared to farmland that uses scientific methods, where each ear can have 240 grains. At a time when the forces of warlords have been cleared and the overall situation of unification has been completed, it is even more gratifying to have this unprecedented bumper harvest in decades. It is appropriate to submit this report along with photos of the auspicious grains to the Municipal Government and the Executive Yuan of the National Government for review and implementation for the convenience of the public. Based on this, the report that the autumn harvest is the best in decades and that the people's strength is reviving is gratifying. In addition to submitting the report and issuing instructions, it is appropriate to submit one photo of the auspicious grains along with this report for your review and for the convenience of the public.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received a report from Wu, the chief of the first district, stating that 4.5 yuan per shi is still owed for the advance borrowing of winter grain transport. According to previous orders, 9 jiao per shi should be repaid from the 19th year until it is cleared in the 23rd year. Therefore, a request was made to retract the order to defer repayment to alleviate the people's difficulties. The county government forwarded the request to the Jiangsu Department of Finance for review. The department ordered, "The advance borrowing of winter grain transport was approved by the Provincial Government Committee, and the deferral of repayment was originally intended to address the provincial budget deficit and provide relief. It should be understood by those who are concerned and love the country. The request to retract the order concerns a general issue and cannot be approved." County Magistrate Yan issued an order yesterday, instructing the township and town chiefs of the district to comply with the order.</p>

<p>The five counties of Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanqiao, Fengxian, and Qingpu have convened multiple meetings regarding joint defense at Shangmei and Songjiang. The date for the current regular meeting was set for November 30th, and it was supposed to be convened by the Nanhui County Government. However, the Shanghai County Government received a letter from County Magistrate Kong of Nanhui stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has already made separate provisions for the division of county joint defenses. The letter asks if the five-county joint defense should continue to meet or be temporarily suspended. After receiving the letter, County Magistrate Yan believed that it was appropriate to convene the current meeting of the joint defense for discussion and decision. Therefore, he sent a letter to Nanhui County for their reference.</p>

<p>Dispatching New Police to Assist in Protection</p>
<p>Negotiating Joint Defense with the Concessions</p>
<p>Recently, Yuan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, considering the arrival of winter and the unrest caused by bandits, has been making winter defense a priority. All defense measures were thoroughly discussed at the previous bureau meeting with the heads of various districts and teams. Several winter defense measures were formulated and circulated to all districts and teams for compliance. As the implementation date approaches and the jurisdiction is vast, bordering the concessions in all directions, the police force is thin and insufficient for deployment. Director Yuan has specially instructed the newly expanded Sixth Police Company Commander to supervise the newly recruited police officers (i.e., the police recruits who graduated from this year's police training school) to intensify their training in preparation for dispatch to assist in defense in various districts in the north and south. Regarding the issue of joint defense between the Chinese and concession territories, personnel have been dispatched to negotiate with the British and French Concession police chiefs and inspectors. In the event of bandit alarms, they will cooperate regardless of jurisdictional boundaries to prevent hiding and avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Submit Urgent Request for Public Bonds</p>
<h3 id="e134">To Survive the End of the Year and Avoid Bankruptcy <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai silk factories, due to the slump in European sales of white filature silk, have suffered substantial financial losses and are unable to sustain operations. A general meeting was held to elect representatives to go to the capital to petition for the issuance of 10 million yuan in public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, along with representatives from Zhejiang and Wuxi who were temporarily added. The petition results were quite satisfactory. The Executive Yuan agreed to instruct the relevant ministries to deliberate, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry also agreed to make every effort to maintain the industry. It has been learned that the petition representatives returned to Shanghai half a month ago, and some silk factories have already resumed operations with encouragement to maintain the livelihood of workers. However, due to the lack of funding and the increasingly sluggish overseas silk sales, the financial community is wary of offering loans against dry cocoons due to concerns about labor unrest, and they dare not hand them over to factories for reeling. The work remains difficult to sustain. Moreover, with the end of the year approaching, silk cocoon pledges cannot be repaid, and bankruptcy is imminent. Recently, the owners of various silk factories have approached Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Silk Industry Association, requesting him to find a way to submit an urgent request to the Executive Yuan to issue public bonds within the year to survive the end of the year and avoid bankruptcy.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Zhejiang Provincial Association Pleads for Silk Merchants <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Silk Cocoon Tax</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Association telegraphed Chairman Chiang on behalf of silk cocoon merchants: "To His Excellency Chairman Chiang of the National Government: Since the cessation of European sales of Chinese silk, merchants have suspended their business, workers have lost their jobs, and the dry cocoon raw materials in the interior, due to the stagnant silk market, cannot find buyers even at reduced prices. Therefore, those who were once considered well-off in the silk cocoon industry will soon become impoverished. The current decline in the silk market only affects the silk cocoon merchants and the male and female workers associated with the silk factories. If this continues without remedy, the farmers in the dry cocoon raw material producing areas will suffer the most. Zhejiang is the most prosperous region for sericulture, producing millions of piculs of cocoons each year. The influx of foreign capital is substantial, and the general population relies on this to pay rent, taxes, and support their families. Once this source of income is cut off, the livelihoods of farmers will be in dire straits. If we revert to reeling native silk, the various silk weaving factories that are now barely surviving will be oversupplied, and they will not be able to absorb the excess. Fertile sericultural land will turn into barren land, and we are deeply apprehensive about the future. The reason for the decline of Chinese silk is the pressure from Japanese silk, which is selling at discounted prices. Japanese silk is backed by government subsidies, so it can continue to lower prices without harming individual businesses. The cost of Chinese silk is higher, and the commercial strength is weaker. Selling at discounted prices will lead to bankruptcy, resulting in the current stalemate. Therefore, the only way to remedy Chinese silk is to find ways to reduce costs. We propose that Your Excellency, mindful of the importance of sericulture to the livelihoods of the people in the southeast, instruct the Ministry of Finance to carefully review and deliberate, and order all customs bureaus to exempt all taxes and levies on raw silk exports and on dry cocoons, so that the future of silk cocoons may be improved. If the cocoon tax is exempted, the cost of raw materials will be lower; if the export tax is exempted, the cost will be even lower, and the price will be even lower. Merchants, appreciating the government's willingness to sacrifice national funds, will strive to improve the quality of their products. If this is done, Chinese silk can still compete with Japanese silk. Otherwise, the irreversible phenomenon will be difficult to reverse, and the European and American markets may no longer see Chinese silk. However, given the current inadequate national finances, the silk cocoon tax revenue is a significant source of government revenue, and a sudden request for exemption may seem alarming. We are aware that silk and tea are treated equally and are major Chinese exports. The government, mindful of the tea industry's failure in recent years, has reduced or exempted tea export taxes for four years. As machine-made foreign goods are already exempt from taxes under the Ministry of Finance's explicit order, it seems not excessive to request that raw silk, also a machine-made product, be granted the same exemption. Fortunately, customs autonomy, tariff reduction, and tax increases are imminent, and the opportunity can be used to revise the tariff schedule and appropriately increase import taxes to offset the loss. The various artificial silks, silk fabrics, wool fabrics, etc. imported from various countries are all enemies that plunder our country's silk industry, and their imports have been increasing year by year. If the tariffs are specially increased to offset the silk cocoon tax revenue, there should be no fear of insufficient national revenue. This is a well-rounded plan that takes both commercial sentiment and national interests into account and can protect domestic production. Currently, with the closure of all silk factories in Shanghai, the association has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting a reduction or exemption of the silk cocoon tax and has proposed both fundamental and temporary solutions to help alleviate the crisis. Now that the crisis of silk cocoons is becoming more urgent and the dangers of sericulture are surrounding us, the association, as a collective organization of Zhejiang people in Shanghai, is deeply concerned about our homeland and spares no effort to speak out repeatedly on behalf of the tens of millions of farmers in Zhejiang. This is not only to seek relief for silk cocoons, but also because silk cocoons are an important national product of our country, and agriculture, industry, and commerce are all directly related. Saving merchants is saving workers and also saving farmers. At a time when the whole country is eagerly looking forward to good governance, we urgently appeal to Your Excellency to implement these measures. We are submitting this urgent telegram in the hope that you will take note. Zhejiang Provincial Association prostrates itself."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Bamboo Industry Federation Strives for Tax Laws <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Bamboo Tax Rate was previously requested by the Jiangsu-Shanghai-Changshu Bamboo Industry Federation to the Finance Bureau for approval. The tax rate for moso bamboo was 1.6 yuan per post, while other light bamboo, bundle bamboo, thin bamboo, bamboo poles, and various utensils were exempted from taxation. The federation notified all colleagues to comply with the payment of taxes. Recently, it was heard that the Wuxi Special Tax Bureau had included light, thin bundle bamboo in the assessment for miscellaneous bamboo taxation. The colleagues in Wuxi reported this to the association. As a result, a meeting was convened to discuss the matter. It was unanimously believed that the Wuxi Special Tax Bureau was clearly defying the law, affecting the industry. Therefore, a notice was printed and sent to all raft owners yesterday stating that if the above situation occurs, they can immediately report to the federation, which will be responsible for negotiating. Subsequently, the name of the association was changed to "Jiangsu-Shanghai-Changshu-Yukun-Wuxi" Bamboo Industry Federation to strengthen the unity of the organization.</p>

<p>Chinese Insurance Policies Prepared for Actual Stamping</p>
<p>Sales Representatives to Discuss Procedures Regularly</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax of the Ministry of Finance launched the promotion of stamp duty in special zones, the results have been excellent. The insurance industry has specially appointed Mr. Wang Yanxiang to be responsible for the promotion of stamp duty. An office has been set up at No. 372 Minyong Lane, Nanjing Road, in the Public Concession, and preparations are well underway. The Chinese insurance industry has already complied with the regulations and actually stamped the policies. However, due to the restrictions of unequal treaties on the foreign merchants' side, negotiations have been held several times. Recently, the Consular Corps has acknowledged that all Chinese insurance policies should be stamped in accordance with the regulations. However, fearing that it would be difficult to understand at the beginning, Mr. Wang, a sales representative of the Bureau's insurance industry, has scheduled a tea party at the Atlantic Restaurant at 3:00 p.m. on the 26th to invite Chinese managers of various foreign insurance companies to discuss all stamping procedures.</p>

<p>The Chunshen Pond waterway in western Shanghai extends from the Huangpu River to Songjiang County, spanning dozens of miles, and is an important waterway for the Shanghai and Songjiang counties. Recently, due to years of sedimentation, the relevant agencies and local people have discussed dredging it. Subsequently, the Municipal Port Authority and the Construction Bureaus of the two counties of Shanghai and Songjiang dispatched personnel to survey the accident site. At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a meeting was specially held at the Shanghai County Construction Bureau to discuss the project. Wu Wenhua and Sun Shengzeng, the directors of the Construction Bureaus of Shanghai and Songjiang counties, Dai Erjing, a technician from the Municipal Port Authority, Gong Maoxing, the chief of the Technology Section of the Shanghai Construction Bureau, and Gu Qi, Yang Songshi, Yang Xinzheng, and others from the Chunshen Pond Dredging Committee attended the meeting. After a long discussion, the following resolutions were immediately made: (1) Regarding the proposed width of the dredged Chunshen Pond waterway and how the bottom width and deepening should be stipulated, it was resolved to divide it into two types: township river and city river. (A) Township River: the width of the surface should be 20 meters and the width of the bottom should be 6 meters. (B) City River: the width of the surface should be 16 meters and the width of the bottom should be 6 meters. (C) The deepening should be 1.8 meters from the deepest point.

All the shops used candles and kerosene lamps instead. The French Electric and Gas Company then sent workers to repair it, which took about fifteen minutes before the lights were restored. After about ten minutes, the lights went out again. The police chief of the jurisdiction, fearing that bandits might take the opportunity to rob, sent Chinese and Western armed detectives to patrol the area until 8:20 p.m. when the lights were finally restored and shone brightly.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Letter from Xiao Xinan Overseas <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Xiao Has Maintained Her Innocence Throughout</p>
<p>Upon Returning to the Country, She Can Request a Famous Doctor for Examination</p>
<p>Expressing Profound Gratitude for the Assistance of Fellow Chinese</p>
<p>Striving to Improve to Repay the Kindness of Compatriots</p>
<p>Original Text of the Apology Letter from the Java Company</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Ms. Xiao Xinan being insulted, this newspaper was the first to report on it, detailing the situation of compatriots from various places rising up to support her. Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Ms. Xiao from the Anbon Chinese Pei De School, describing everything in detail. We are now recording it for the readers' pleasure.</p>
<p>To the editor of Shenbao newspaper,</p>
<p>Your esteemed newspaper was the first to speak out for my injustice, causing compatriots across the country to rise up and help, for which I am deeply grateful. The situation of the incident has been reported in your newspaper, and the progress of the negotiations has also been recorded. Now, I will tell you what has not been mentioned. After the incident, Consul Tao negotiated with the shipowner on one hand and telegraphed Consul Wang in Makassar on the other to handle the matter. When the ship arrived in Makassar, I was taken to the Immigration Hall by the port police for questioning without any hindrance, which proves that I am not mentally ill (logically, those who are mentally ill would be sent to the hospital). After the questioning, I went to the consulate with my guarantor. An official came out to meet me and said that the ship had called to invite me to board the ship for negotiations. I then boarded the ship with my guarantor and his son. When we arrived at the pier, we were stopped by the police. I had to wait for a while before a Chinese crew member came down from the ship. I asked him to notify Consul Wang to come and take me on board. Soon after, Consul Wang and Consul Tao came down and said that the shipowner wanted to negotiate without publicizing it. I also agreed to their request, so when various groups and newspaper reporters came to inquire, I politely declined to answer. After several days, I only received a written apology and one person was punished. When the overseas Chinese in the South heard about it, they were even more indignant and informed me of the feelings of the overseas Chinese in the South and the power of the consulate to handle matters. I then publicized the negotiations to avoid future troubles for my compatriots. After the announcement, the Xiao Case Support Association was organized to unite various organizations to support Consul Wang. Schools and community groups in various places sent telegrams asking Consul Wang to negotiate to the end. Now I read in the Xinbao newspaper that the Java Batavia head office replied that they have agreed to dismiss the chief mate and issued a written apology to me, saying that the second mate had no evidence to confirm the charges and could not handle it. Recently, the Ambon government has received a document from a higher official asking me to investigate. I was interrogated at the government office yesterday and today with the principal of this school. I will continue to report on future situations. I respectfully wish you good health,</p>
<p>Xiao Xinan</p>
<p>P.S. I have enclosed a letter asking you to forward it.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Xiao Xinjing's Message <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>To the fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and sisters of the nation:</p>
<p>This time I came south because I was introduced by the Education Bureau of the capital city of the motherland to start a business. I am eager to return home, and I especially cannot break faith with the authorities. I will not allow myself to do anything for any group that I do not agree with, but once I agree, I will never turn back. This is my nature, and I believe it is the spirit that one should have as a human being. Thinking back, I was displaced twice in Jiangbei during the war and lectured three times under artillery fire, but I never encountered any danger. This is known to my relatives and friends. Therefore, after falling into a lonely situation, there was no turning back, so I resolutely embarked on the journey. However, I had not been to the coast for eight years, and I had never seen a sea vessel. Before boarding the ship, I did not know anyone, and after boarding the ship, I lacked deep friendships. I encountered danger along the way and had no way to complain, so I could only find ways to protect myself and struggle with the thugs to avoid harm, first to comfort the heart of family education, and second to repay the cultivation of the motherland. Unexpectedly, the thugs took an inch and wanted a mile and even forced me to death. Fortunately, I relied on the long coat covering my head as a衬, wearing a long shirt and pants tied around my waist for protection, to avoid reaching their ultimate goal, leaving this innocence to comfort my compatriots. I am a woman who has not been sexually assaulted. In the future, when I return to my country, I can ask a famous doctor to examine me to prove it. After the pain in my heart, this is the only thing that can comfort my family and relatives. If I continue to endure this in the end, I am afraid that I will cause trouble for my compatriots, and I also believe that there is no guilt in my heart, so I do not need to be afraid to speak. I am willing to sacrifice everything to announce the truth to encourage people. Recently, I read in the newspaper that compatriots in the motherland heard the news and rose up to help me, which is very fortunate. Yesterday, I read in the Xinbao newspaper that the Java Batavia head office replied that the chief mate had agreed to be dismissed and issued a written apology to me, saying that the second mate had no evidence to confirm the charges and could not handle it. I am a person who studies education. Now that modern science is flourishing, I sincerely hope to use psychological experiments to clarify the truth about their actions that are upside down and bury their conscience, and negotiate to the end. I deeply hope that all sectors of the motherland will help me find a world-renowned hypnotist and hand over these two thugs to the Java Company for experiments. Recently, I read an advertisement in the Shenbao newspaper column that the hypnosis of the China Spiritual Research Association on Xihaining Road, Beisichuan Road, Shanghai can explore the right and wrong of crimes effectively. I also hope that compatriots who care about my case will inquire about it. In the unlikely event that the negotiations can be achieved, I will return my carefree life from this sad remaining life, work hard to fulfill my responsibilities, save a little money, and then go to various countries to investigate education, hoping to return to my country in the future to make a small contribution to repay the kindness of compatriots across the country. I only wish that things would be as I hope, but the world is full of vicissitudes and human affairs are unpredictable, which is worrying. And I ask my relatives and friends not to be concerned about my personal misfortune. From now on, work hard for the country to increase its strength and reduce internal strife and external insults. This is what I hope. I will wait for the sadness to subside a little and record in the newspaper the experiences and feelings of this trip, the common sense of the waterway experienced by a woman alone, and the attitude to respond to danger and the things to prepare for danger, so as to avoid compatriots from following in my footsteps. As I write, I am sad and cannot express all my feelings.</p>
<p>Xiao Xin</p>
<p>Original Apology Letter Java Company's apology letter to Ms. Xiao is translated as follows: "Ms. Xiao, c/o Chinese Consul, Makassar.

<p>After Jiang Weiqiao Was Kidnapped</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Process of Contacting the Bandits <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Bandits Sent Three Letters</p>
<p>Arranging Negotiations in a Hotel</p>
<p>The Victim Went as Agreed</p>
<p>But There Was No News</p>
<p>Jiang Weiqiao, the owner of the Jiang Xiangxing Slaughterhouse Company on Xijiaotong Road, Zhabei, was kidnapped on the evening of the 23rd of last month at 6:30 PM when he boarded his own cargo truck to go to the distribution point on Kangnuot Road. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. A month has passed and he is still in danger. Yesterday, this newspaper reporter happened to meet a close relative of Jiang's at a banquet, who described the process of contacting the bandits in detail. Now, I will record what the relative said.</p>
<p>The First Letter The relative said (the following is all the relative's words): After Jiang was kidnapped on the 23rd of last month, the whole family was extremely anxious, especially Jiang's brother, Weibin (also known as Taikang). For almost ten days, the bandits had no response and there was no news. It was not until the 29th that a letter came directly to Jiang Weibin. The envelope was addressed to "Mr. Jiang Taikang, 16 Fengtian Road, American Concession, Shanghai." It was signed "Yue Jian." Inside, in addition to a piece of paper written by the bandits, there was also a ransom note in the victim's handwriting. The letter stated that the victim was chained in the bandit's den, suffering from dysentery, and urged his brother to quickly prepare the full ransom of 300,000 yuan to redeem him.</p>
<p>Demanding 300,000 Yuan The bandit's letter stated: "Your brother (referring to the victim) is being treated very well here, but because there are many colleagues in our department and the economy is exhausted, we plan to temporarily borrow 300,000 yuan from you to meet our urgent needs." It also stated: "If you sincerely want to negotiate, please publish the advertisement on the first page of Shenbao according to the following draft, with the number representing 10,000. For example, if you agree to 300,000 yuan, then publish 300 yuan." Therefore, on the 1st of this month, a missing person advertisement was found in the second advertisement of this newspaper. The original manuscript is recorded below: "Missing Person Yesterday, a black leather bag was lost on the way, containing several important documents and a round seal with the篆文character Yue Xiang. If anyone finds it, please send it to (Room 84, Jue Lu Hotel). A reward of 15 yuan will be paid immediately, and we will never go back on our word. Yue Xiang"</p>
<p>Second Warning After the victim's brother, Jiang Taikang, published the advertisement as ordered, the so-called reward of 15 yuan meant agreeing to a price of 150,000 yuan. Two days later, the bandits sent another letter stating: "After reading the report, we know that the agreed price is too different and there is no possibility of negotiation. Your Excellency (referring to Weibin) must not be sincere. We are sending another letter as a warning, hoping that you will reconsider and publish the lowest price as a reply to make a final decision." After Taikang received the letter, he published another advertisement asking the bandits to arrange a date and time to contact him directly at Jiang's residence at 16 Fengtian Road.</p>
<p>No News From Then On After Taikang published the advertisement for the second time, another week passed and the bandits sent a third letter stating: "Since you want to negotiate face-to-face, please open a room with the largest telephone at the New World Hotel on Nanjing Road tomorrow. The name on the passenger list at the door must be Hu. Someone will come to contact you then." The letter also included a note in the victim's handwriting, generally asking his brother to quickly find a way to rescue him. Jiang's family prepared as instructed, but no one came that night.

<p>The Father Gave All He Had to Marry Off His Daughter</p>
<p>The Daughter Refused to Help Her Father at All</p>
<p>Filled with Extreme Hatred, He Tried to Kill Her with a Knife</p>
<p>Wu Maomao, a villager in Zhoujiaqiao in West Shanghai, makes a living growing flowers. He had a daughter, Wu Shi, who married Gao Shidao, the son of Gao Shaoqing, who lives in Gaojiahang, south of Zhoujiaqiao, two years ago. Wu Maomao wanted to save face, so the dowry was especially rich, so that he spent all his savings and even mortgaged the base land for money. This is the harm of vanity. Wu had no rice to cook, so last year he and a friend ran a flower shed to make a living. Wu complained to his daughter, asking her to speak to her parents-in-law and husband to borrow one or two hundred yuan as capital, and he would repay them with interest. If not, then twenty or thirty yuan would also be fine to start a small business. He expected a reply in about a week, but the daughter was indifferent and did not reply. Wu went to inquire and was ridiculed by Gao Shaoqing and others, which was extremely embarrassing. He was very resentful in his heart. This year, because of various unsatisfactory things, the flower shed run by his friend was very prosperous. Wu thought that if his daughter had a little human heart and helped him, he would not be as prosperous as others and his own life would be so desolate. He hated her so much that he had the idea of killing her. Yesterday morning, he knew that his daughter would definitely go to the yarn factory to work, so he waited on the road with a sharp knife. When his daughter passed by, he grabbed her and stabbed her hard in the ribs. The daughter cried out for help. Gao and others rushed out and grabbed Wu, snatching the knife, but the daughter had already been stabbed in the waist, bleeding all over her body, and was seriously injured. They then ordered the police to come and arrest Wu at the Sixth District Police Station, and sent the injured person to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. In the afternoon, the district transferred the two parties to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Defendant Du Ke Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fine</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that Du Ke, the deck engineer of the American ship Ai Wuwa, was drunk and disorderly in a bar on Broadway last Sunday, stabbing the English constable Qin Jinsheng. The case was reopened in the American consulate on Saturday. Qin Jinsheng was first called to testify that he went to the bar for a drink last Sunday morning and met his friend Mo Le. While they were standing and talking, the defendant, who was already drunk, joined in with slanderous words. He pushed him aside, and the defendant stood between the two of them again and spoke rudely. He then lightly struck his nose and continued to talk to Mo Le as before. Not long after, Mo Le was suddenly punched in the back of the head, and he also felt that he had been hit from behind. He immediately fell to the ground, and Mo Le saw blood on his clothes and realized that he had been stabbed and injured. He was sent to the hospital, and the defendant had already disappeared. After describing the events, he presented the bloody clothes as evidence. Mo Le was then called to testify and gave the same account. The defendant Du Ke also admitted to being drunk and disorderly, but said that he could not remember the situation at the time. Finally, the prosecutor argued that although there was no concrete evidence to prove who stabbed Qin Jinsheng, all the witnesses pointed to the defendant. The judge then sentenced Du Ke to 60 days in prison and fined him $100.</p>

<p>Traffic Blocked for Twenty Minutes</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at 6:35 PM, a Route 5 trolleybus traveling from the West Gate to the North Railway Station derailed its rear carriage when it reached the Stealing Chicken Bridge station on North Zhejiang Road. The wheels rolled on the road, scattering sparks. The passengers on the carriage were panicked. The driver quickly stopped the bus, and the passengers jumped off one after another. They then tried to drag it back onto the track, but half of the wheel suddenly fell into the adjacent track, making it even more difficult. As a result, more than twenty trolleybuses traveling to and from Nanjing Road to the Garbage Bridge were unable to move forward. For a time, the onlookers gathered and the traffic was blocked. After twenty minutes, the carriage was driven back onto its original track, and the buses gradually moved and returned to their original state.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Xin Case Support Association Hosts Press <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Last night at six o'clock, the Xin Dingxiang Tragedy Support Association hosted news reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in this port at the Fuxing Garden on Simalu (Four Horse Road). During the event, Chairman Cheng Zhiliang, Ni Yaoxian, Cai Xiaohe, and Yang Yiqing, among others, reported on the details of the tragedy, stating that the Xin case had occurred several days ago, and the French imperialists had shown no sincerity in resolving it. This demonstrates their disregard for China. For the sake of national survival and to protect national sovereignty, Chinese people should vow to fight for the Xin case. It is hoped that the press will advocate for humanity and justice, widely publish the French's reliance on strength and their brutal actions, so that people around the world can know the true face of the French. Subsequently, Guan Jiu'an, a reporter from the Republican Daily, was publicly elected by the press to deliver a response. The event concluded at nine o'clock.</p>
<p>The Seven Major Labor Unions, including the local Postal Workers' Union, the Commercial Workers' Union, the Chinese Electrical Workers' Union, the China Merchants Bureau Workers' Union, the Press Workers' Union, and the British-American Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, issued a declaration yesterday regarding the Xin Dingxiang Tragedy. The text is recorded as follows for the public to see: Fellow compatriots across the country, French imperialists, with their gunboat policy, run rampant in our country, treating us as a second-class colony. Our entire nation is like meat on a chopping board. Thinking of this, we are filled with pain and resentment. This time, a French warship, the "Waldeck-Rousseau," had a sailor who, when hailing a sampan to return to the ship, was asked by the sampan operator, Xin Dingxiang, to pay the ferry fare. Unexpectedly, the sailor brutally assaulted Xin and pushed him into the river, causing him to drown. When the news spread, the whole country was indignant. After serious negotiations by the Tragedy Support Association, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Gan Gelin, replied to the Municipal Government, stating in the document that the murderer had been severely punished by the naval authorities. The wording was vague, and it was just empty words to shirk responsibility. The French authorities' lack of sincerity in resolving the matter is already clear. French imperialists have invaded our sovereignty, insulted our national integrity, and slaughtered our people. They have been doing this for a long time and it has only gotten worse. Our union believes that unless we rely on the strength of the government and the support of the people to engage in serious and uncompromising negotiations with the French authorities, we will not be able to deter the arrogance of the French imperialists. In addition to the Support Association continuing to petition the government to protest seriously, we must be sure to achieve the goal of punishing the murderer according to the law, paying compensation and pensions, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. In addition to our union providing support, we also hope that the entire nation will unite and rise up together to carry out the movement to recover concessions, abolish consular jurisdiction, withdraw the naval and land forces of all countries stationed in China, and abolish all unequal treaties. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>Child Kidnappers Rampant</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been increasing reports of child abductions in various parts of the Chinese and foreign concessions in this city. The daughter of a Ma family from Taixing, named Zhao Di, just six years old, disappeared after playing outside their door at No. 4, Lane 2, Huaizhen Street, Jiumu area. Her family searched everywhere but found no trace of her. Similarly, a Chen family living at Chujia Bridge on Mintini Road also lost their second son, named Didi, seven years old, at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. He was playing with neighborhood children by the roadside when a man in a black cloth long gown infiltrated the group of children and enticed Didi to follow him to watch airplanes and offered him candy. The child, being innocent, followed him north. Fortunately, his family came out to search and caught up with him. When they questioned the child, the man fled. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a Gao family girl from Ningbo, just six years old, disappeared from a coal shop on Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. Her mother was doing laundry inside, and the child was sitting at the door. In a blink of an eye, she was gone. Her mother is a widow and only has this one daughter, so she was extremely distraught after her disappearance. Her neighbors are helping her search, but it is unknown whether she will be able to find her daughter.</p>
<h3 id="e175">False Accusation of Communist Party Sabotage <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Chun Kai Failed to Appear in Court</p>
<p>Ma Wenlin's Power is Extremely Strong</p>
<p>The dismissed police officer Ma Wenlin and his apprentice Yu Renbiao previously falsely accused Jiang Chunkai from Tongzhou of being a communist party member intending to extort 800 silver dollars. The police station detained Ma and Yu and brought them to the Special District Court for interrogation. This matter has been reported in previous newspapers. The case was continued by Judge Feng the day before yesterday. The plaintiff, Jiang Chunkai, did not appear in court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the plaintiff was lured to Jiangwan by Ma's henchmen and identified as a communist party member, and the Public Security Bureau there detained Jiang. Therefore, he could not appear in court today. He requested that a letter be sent to the Public Security Bureau to transfer Jiang. The defendant, Ma Wenlin, has extremely strong power, with over a thousand followers. The police searched his home and found Ma's business card, with the meeting time engraved on the back. This is evident and the card was submitted as evidence. Subsequently, witnesses Wang Fanshi, Zhao Sunshi, and others separately testified that Ma and Yu went to Jiang's residence that day, accusing Jiang of being a communist party member, intending to extort money, and assaulting Zhao Sunshi, injuring her. Ma denied that the business card was engraved by him. As for his actions of extorting money from Jiang that day, his testimony was similar to the previous one, constantly shirking responsibility. Yu Renbiao testified that he was forced to go by Ma. Judge Feng ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and a letter to be sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to inquire about the reason for Jiang Chunkai's detention. The case was adjourned for review.</p>

<p>Shen, the District Chief of Qutang District in Taixian County, learned that Zhu Diao and Wang Ruzhou, two important communist party fugitives who were wanted by the county government for the large-scale riots in Tong, Rutai, and other counties in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic and the fierce battle between soldiers and bandits in Sunjiazhuang in Taixian County and the Red Army's attack on Lujia Lane this spring, had secretly come to Shanghai a month ago. He immediately ordered his staff to take a document to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance in capturing them. Director Yuan immediately dispatched personnel to cooperate. Yesterday, Zhu was arrested on the way in Zhabei. He was immediately taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, Wang had already escaped to Jiangxi, and his whereabouts were unknown.</p>

<p>Zhao Guangbi, an investigator from the Yangshupu Police Station, married Ms. Gong San last year, but he still could not sever his relationship with Wang Deng, whom he had known before. He also abused Ms. Gong. When she argued with him, Zhao wrote a letter of repentance and was willing to give Ms. Gong living expenses every month, but he soon went back on his word, leading Ms. Gong to file for divorce in the Special District Court. Judge Xu Wenrong summoned both parties for interrogation and concluded the case the day before yesterday, announcing a judgment granting the plaintiff a divorce from the defendant. The defendant should compensate the plaintiff for room and board expenses of 146 yuan and pay the plaintiff alimony of 1,700 yuan. The plaintiff's other claims were rejected.</p>

<p>Underage</p>
<p>Wait Until Next Year to Sue Again</p>
<p>Yang Shouzeng, a partner in Yuyuan Qianzhuang, was engaged to Feng Jiafen by his father, Yang Cangsheng. At the time, both Yang and Feng were only fourteen years old. Now, they are both nearing adulthood. Feng, because her parents did not seek her consent at the time of the engagement and she is not yet formally married, believes that she can still remedy the situation. She came to Shanghai from her original home in Cixi, temporarily residing at her uncle's house at No. 412, Xintangjia Lane, to negotiate the termination of the engagement. However, Yang Shouzeng strongly opposed it. Feng then sued in the Special District Court, requesting that the engagement be terminated based on the principle of freedom of marriage. Judge Ying Shiting opened the court the day before yesterday and summoned the defendant, Yang Shouzeng, who did not appear. The plaintiff, Feng Jiafen, then stated:</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>I am now twenty years old. This engagement was arranged by my parents, and I knew nothing about it beforehand. Therefore, I am unwilling to marry him, so I filed a lawsuit. Judge Ying then inquired when she was born, since she claimed to be twenty years old. Feng replied that her birthday was May 11th. The defendant's lawyer then stated that the civil law stipulates that one must be twenty years old to be considered an adult, and only adults have the capacity for legal action. Otherwise, legal actions must be represented by a legal guardian. The plaintiff's age is actually only nineteen, and she does not have the right to sue according to the law. Judge Ying agreed that the defendant's lawyer's statement was reasonable and advised the plaintiff: You are not yet of legal age. If you want to sue, you must be represented by a parent. However, the engagement you are requesting to revoke was permitted and established by your parents, so they will not agree to revoke it. In order to protect your legal interests, you should withdraw the case for now and file a lawsuit in this court again on May 12th of next year, when you turn twenty. Feng Jiafen was deeply grateful for the judge's kindness in considering both law and reason and authorized her lawyer to withdraw the lawsuit in court.</p>

<p>Master Ordered to Pay Compensation of 100 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Ding Shijun from Anhui previously hired a lawyer to represent him in the French court, claiming that the plaintiff's mother had been working in the defendant Zhou Mingji's house as a maid and was accused by a fellow maid, A Cai, of stealing items, causing her to commit suicide out of anger. Before the suicide, the madam of the house had treated her improperly. Afterwards, when he asked for money for a coffin, he was ignored, showing that he had committed intentional homicide. He requested an investigation. The defendant also hired a lawyer to handle everything. The court ordered them to await judgment. The day before yesterday, the police summoned both parties to the court. Judge Zhu ruled that the evidence presented by the plaintiff of intentional homicide was insufficient to establish the case. Considering that the plaintiff was poor, the defendant Zhou Mingji was ordered to pay compensation of 100 yuan. The court fees were to be borne by the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Sometimes a Wife, Sometimes a Daughter, Mentally Disturbed</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at one o'clock, a young woman with a pretty face checked into the Rongsheng Inn in the Qiu Xinqiao area of the South City. The inn, because she was a single woman, feared that there might be something else going on and did not provide lodging. A dispute arose between the two parties. The watchman of the 26th post, Ma Shuxuan, heard about it and came to investigate. He found the woman's behavior suspicious and took her back to the First Section of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation by the head of the section, she said that her name was Zhang Zhushi, 19 years old, from Taixing. After speaking, she suddenly fell silent. When questioned again and again, she claimed that she was not yet married and her parents were dead. She only had an older brother and sister-in-law. This time, she came to Shanghai alone by boat because she disagreed with her sister-in-law and often quarreled, so she was extremely angry and willing to leave this evil family, and so on. Then, she burst into tears. The head of the section observed that the woman's mental state was deeply stimulated, resulting in incoherent speech. He ordered a document to be prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that she be placed somewhere.</p>

<p>Riya Bank Is Not a Pharmacy</p>
<p>Kidnapped to Pudong, Case Cracked by Police</p>
<p>Li Yuebao, a 14-year-old girl from Jiading, had a pretty face and loved to be fashionable. She was very close to Zhang Zhao, a neighboring woman. Recently, Zhang Zhao suddenly became blind and planned to come to Shanghai with her son, Zhang Guohua, for medical treatment. Li Yuebao also planned to come to Shanghai to play and serve her. With the consent of Yuebao's parents, they came to Shanghai and stayed at the Hui'an Hotel on Zhejiang Road. They had a lot of fun treating the illness and playing. Unexpectedly, Li Koutu, a man from Tongzhou who had worked as a craftsman in Jiading Hongmu, encountered Zhang Guohua and asked him why he had come to Shanghai. Zhang replied that he was treating his mother's illness. Li Koutu then took Qu Longchang, also from Tongzhou who had also worked in Jiading Hongmu, to the hotel and invited Zhang Guohua and others to play together. Li Yuebao wanted to return home because a neighbor had asked her to buy headache medicine. She begged Zhang Guohua to take her to a pharmacy. So they went together. Because the country people were unfamiliar with the way, Qu Longchang pointed to Riya Bank as a pharmacy. Because there were many vehicles, Qu Longchang and Li Yuebao stood at the north end of the bank waiting for Zhang Guohua to go south alone. When Zhang reached the bank, he inquired and found that it was a bank, not a pharmacy. He had to turn back, but he did not see Li Yuebao and Qu Longchang. He was quite shocked and searched everywhere without success. He had to return to the residence and tell Zhang Zhao. Zhang Zhao was planning to ask someone to report to the police and search for them when Qu Longchang suddenly came to the door. Zhang asked where Li Yuebao was. Qu replied that she was now in Pudong. If he wanted to get her back, he would have to pay 150 silver dollars. Zhang replied, "Where would I get so much money?" Qu actually punched him. Then, he left angrily and went to a friend named He at Sanmaoge Bridge. Zhang immediately tracked him down with his mother. Zhang Zhao grabbed Qu Longchang and refused to let go, shouting for the French police to bring the group to the police station. According to Qu Longchang's confession, he had kidnapped Li Yuebao to Pudong, but he was questioned by a patrolman from the Third District, and Li was detained while he escaped. The French police determined that the incident occurred in the Chinese Concession and transferred the defendant to the Second District First Section yesterday afternoon at about 4:00 PM. Chief Qian interrogated Qu Longchang and determined that he had committed the act of kidnapping and selling a good family's daughter. He was sentenced to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a young woman with a bun and wearing a local factory striped cloth shirt and apron was found near the Sanwan Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, with a sad face and constantly crying. The patrol officer asked her, and she said that she had been kidnapped and lost her way. He immediately took her to the Lan Nidu Public Security Bureau's Third Section for interrogation. The woman said that her name was Gan A'si, 14 years old, from Jiading. Her father's name was Gan Mengfu, and he was a local guarantor. Her grandfather's name was Gan A'chun, and he was working at the Caojiadu Fire Brigade in Shanghai. Three days ago, she followed a blind old woman from her neighborhood to Shanghai to see a doctor. They stayed in a small inn. Today, she went out from the hospital because the road was crowded and she was separated from the old woman. Then, she asked for directions to Caojiadu to find her grandfather. On the way, she met two young men who tricked her into taking a ferry to Pudong and wanted to take her to live in a shack. She realized that she had been deceived, so she refused to go with them. Just then, the police came to investigate, and they fled in different directions. The district chief verified her statement and determined that the woman had been deceived and almost raped by bandits. He ordered an investigation and ordered that the woman be temporarily detained in the district while her family was notified to claim her.</p>

<p>Wu Zhaogan from Tengxian County, Shandong, 55 years old, was a worker in the arsenal and lived at No. 2727, Longhua Road, behind the Weibaotuan in Jijiawan. A fellow villager named Duan opened a small cigarette and paper shop there. Recently, Duan and Wu had disagreements and often slandered each other. Yesterday, Wu went to question Duan, and there was a big conflict. Wu broke all the items on the counter in Duan's shop and returned home angrily. The anger had not subsided, and at the same time, he felt that breaking other people's property would not end well if the police were reported. The feelings of anger and fear were intertwined, so he felt that it was better to commit suicide. He secretly bought opium at a nearby cigarette shop and swallowed it. By the time the poison took effect, no one knew, and his husband came home from work and found out, but it was too late to save him. He was greatly saddened and twisted Duan to the local police station and sent him to the Sixth District Third Section for submission to the Public Security Bureau. In addition, the local guarantor Xu Jinliang reported to the local court for an autopsy. Zhao, the prosecutor, and others came to the scene to examine the body and determined that it was suicide by swallowing opium.

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 8:00 PM, a lost boy about seven or eight years old was crying on the side of Hudong Road in West Shanghai. He was brought back to the Sixth District Second Section by patrol officer Shi Wenjin. He was asked his name and address, but he did not know much. He seemed to have a Jiangbei accent. He was wearing a black hat, a printed cloth shirt, black cloth pants, patterned socks, and black shoes. Because no one claimed him, he was sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for custody, waiting for his family to claim him.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, four thugs came to No. 315, Shanxi Road, Public Concession. Two of them were holding pistols and threatened the victim, robbing him of clothes and jewelry estimated to be worth 170 silver dollars. The victim reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 4:30 AM, a Mr. Jia, riding in a rickshaw, was robbed while traveling on Xinzha Road. A thug emerged from the alley, and two of them, carrying axes and one holding a pistol, blocked the road and searched him. Unfortunately, there was nothing of value in his pockets, only a few copper coins. The clothes he was wearing were also not worth much, causing the robbers to be disappointed. They injured him in two places with an axe. The robbers then escaped empty-handed.</p>

<p>— Yì Nóng</p>
<p>I came from Fujian to Zhejiang, passing through the Ao River, crossing the Feiyun Ferry, and arriving at the Ou River, also known as the Rong River. It is named Rong River because the mountains and waters of Yongjia are beautiful and the residences are elegant. Every family has a small garden planted with hibiscus. Around the Double Ninth Festival, when the flowers bloom, they are white in the morning, pink at noon, and red in the evening, changing color three times in one day, hence the name "Three Drunkennesses." Although it is not as prosperous as it used to be, there are still tall hibiscus plants towering above the clouds in people's fences and ancient temples. The abundance of flowers and the beauty of the colors are the most brilliant scenery in the autumn. Xie Kang Le said, "The hibiscus in the early sun," he must have seen something and said that. This is the origin of the name Rong River. In the river, the solitary island is charming, and the twin pagodas compete for beauty. There is a temple in the middle called Jiangxin Temple. Monk Dixian once presided over this temple. Above is Haoran Tower and Chengxian Pavilion. Next to it is the Wen Tianxiang Shrine. The couplets on the pillars and the inscriptions on the walls are beautiful beyond words. The hermit of Taihe Mountain has a couplet that says, "Floating clouds and solitary islands change with the tide, and the barren tombs in the evening rain enter the cold dream." This is a realistic record. To the east of the river, adjacent to the city, there is Feixia Cave, where Liu Gen of the Song Dynasty cultivated himself. Above is the Woshu Tower. Below the tower is a camphor tree that can be embraced. It protrudes diagonally through the window, and its winding shape is like a sleeping tree, hence the name Woshu Tower. Climbing this tower, one can see the overlapping green mountains in the distance and the green fields in the vicinity. With nearby water and distant mountains, there are endless poetic thoughts. At the foot of the mountain is Xie Gongyan, which used to be a place for Xie Gong to relax. The Taoists in the cave planted peaches for their own enjoyment. The tour paths are winding and graceful, although it is not a paradise outside the world. However, a few years ago, due to carelessness, the fire burned the tower and scorched the trees, and now it is half withered. Thinking of the past and the present, one cannot help but sigh. To the south of the river is Huagai Mountain, with Daguan Pavilion, Jigu Pavilion, and Zifu Temple on it. They were all famous scenic spots in the past. Today, a wide road has been opened to build Zhongshan Park. Leaning against the mountains and surrounded by water, the scenery is beautiful. Gentlemen and ladies stroll around, their hairpins and clothes fragrant, chatting and drinking tea to relieve their mood. The construction of the park was planned by the poet Zheng Jiangmen, and it has become a magnificent sight. At the foot of the mountain is Huangye Village, where there is a Ou Society, a place where poets and lyricists gather to recite poems and compose verses, created by the lyric master Lin Tiezun. Today, friends are scattered, and the sound of chanting is silent. To the west of the river, adjacent to the city, there is Yifeng Pavilion. Although this pavilion is only a few bows wide, its architecture is exquisite. Overlooking the river and admiring the mountains, its scenery is particularly charming. The sails and sand crows fluttering between the distant shores of the setting sun are like painting a natural picture. Recently, the autumn sky is clear and the water and trees are bright, and all things are quiet and secluded. Friends in Ou led me to Yangyuan to admire the chrysanthemums. The owner of the garden is Yang Yuanfeng and Danfeng, two hermits who live a simple life and use growing chrysanthemums as their livelihood. They carefully study irrigation and cultivation methods for decades. When the flowers bloom, they invite friends to recite poems and drink wine to appreciate them. Their colors are clear and beautiful, their fragrance is secluded and far-reaching, and their varieties are unique and elegant. Not only does Ou Zhong have no such good varieties, but there are also varieties that chrysanthemum artists in Shanghai have never seen. Yangyuan is the best place for chrysanthemums in Ou Zhong. The poems and verses of singing and harmonizing have filled the chest. I said that the Yang brothers' happiness cannot be exchanged even for a king facing south. As for the accumulated green of Songtai, the clarity and openness of Jiushan, and the pleasant garden of the Zeng family and the Yu garden of the Lü family, although each has its own pleasing scenery, I was unable to visit them all one by one due to busy matters, and I still feel nostalgic in my heart. Only by paddling a small boat and touring the Hualiu Pond and the Qianhu area did I see the hibiscus on the shore still reflecting in the setting sun. The splendor of the scenery is different from that of the early sun, with a rich and beautiful appearance that makes people forget their fatigue when they see it. Returning home, I had nothing to do, so I moistened my brush and wrote a record of it. I have three poems to record its victory, which are attached below: The scenery of Rongjiang is naturally quiet and secluded, and the heavens give poets free rein. The autumn colors fill the river, and the early sun is beautiful. The tourist has been famous for thousands of years. The happiness of growing chrysanthemums in Yangyuan is a natural pleasure. The cold beauty and secluded fragrance remind me of the righteous and famous scholars of the Jin Dynasty. The poet's feelings and the hero's wine are used to appreciate the flowers every year. The guest's home is at the end of the Cang River. Every time the flowers bloom, I still love the flowers. After parting, my feelings are melancholy. Looking at the Yingying autumn water, I hope for Jianjia.</p>

<p>— Thin Gull</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors outside that the photographer Mr. Lin Xuehuai and the movie star Ms. Hu Die have broken up. Most of the words are speculation and cannot be believed. Gull and both parties are old friends and know the details quite well. I dare to give readers a truthful report.</p>
<p>Xuehuai has recently made a lot of profit in the gold business. However, people in the gold business often like to gamble, so Xuehuai also indulged a little. Miss Die knew about it and was not happy. Xuehuai was also a little concerned that Miss Die often liked to go out at night. Last Sunday, they had a verbal conflict. This is just a normal state of children and there is no so-called breakup. Currently, friends are acting as Lu Zhonglian, hoping to clear the clouds and see the moon again.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Rare News from the Theatrical World <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Master of the Plum Blossom Pavilion</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang and Yang Xiaolou to Arrive in Shanghai Simultaneously</p>
<p>Rumors of Mei Wan-hua [Mei Lanfang], owner of the Zhui Yu Xuan studio, coming to Shanghai have been circulating for a long time. Now, we have received confirmation. We are delighted to hear that Mr. Mei is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 25th of this month, and no later than the 27th. This is because the 28th is the 70th birthday celebration of the mother of Chairman Chen Tiaoyuan. It is rare for a person to live to seventy years old, and his colleagues have specially initiated a grand theatrical performance to celebrate Madam's birthday. A month ago, Mr. Chen had already sent someone to Peiping to invite Mei to Shanghai to perform on stage as scheduled. Wan-hua originally had plans to visit Shanghai, so he happily agreed. The reason why he must arrive by the 27th is because there was an early agreement with the Chen residence that could not be changed.</p>
<p>The Chen residence originally intended to invite the three giants, Mei (Lanfang), Yang (Xiaolou), and Yu (Shuyan), for the theatrical performance. However, when the representative of the Chen residence arrived in Peiping, Little Yu was weak and ill and firmly refused to risk the trip. Although efforts were made to persuade him through various connections, the result was still negative. After Yang Xiaolou returned to Peiping from Lotus Mountain, he was in good spirits. Upon introduction by someone, a deal was made for 18,000 yuan. However, during the negotiations, Xiaolou made two conditions: (1) The performance period was set for three days, and no additional days could be added temporarily. He must return to Peiping after singing for three days. (2) He would not perform in any charity performances. The Chen residence should provide a firm guarantee that if there were any difficulties, the Chen residence would be responsible for handling them and politely decline any refusals. The representative of the Chen residence fully agreed to both requirements, and the agreement was concluded. This is a rough account of Xiaolou's arrival in Shanghai. It is also rumored that Xiaolou's arrival in Shanghai will be around the same time as Wan-hua's.</p>
<p>Kun actress Xue Yanqin performed at the Tiansheng Stage for more than a month and gained a great reputation. Her performance period has expired and she took a boat north on the 20th.</p>
<p>Kun actress Du Liyun's reputation rose sharply after going to Peiping the year before last. Under the careful guidance of Wang Yaoqing, her art has also improved day by day. She is currently performing in rotation at the Kai Ming Theater and Harbin Film Theater in the old capital, and both are sold out every day. It is now heard that a theater in Shanghai has sent people to Peiping to repeatedly invite Du, but Du has repeatedly declined with humility, and it is expected that she will come to Shanghai next autumn.</p>
<p>Musical Notes: The Pingsheng Music Society of this city has been promoting Kunqu opera for 20 years. In addition to regular monthly meetings, they also hold joint performances. The third joint performance this month will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at 1 p.m. on the 23rd. All the supporting roles are members of the society, which is not easy. The program for the day is as follows:</p>
<p>Daytime Performances: (The Story of the Pipa) Appreciating the Lotus, Cutting Hair, Selling Hair, Sweeping Pine; (Romance of the Western Chamber) Visiting the Temple, Making a Racket, Sending a Letter, A Good Time; (Lu Lin); (Legend of the White Snake) Burning Incense, Water Duel, Broken Bridge, Reunion.</p>
<p>Evening Performances: (The Peony Pavilion) Encouraging Agriculture, School, Strolling in the Garden and Praising Flowers, Piling Flowers, A Startling Dream, Searching for a Dream, Flower Judge; (Mistakes of the Kite) A Startling Ugly Face, First Relatives, Later Relatives, Tea Gathering.</p>
<p>News from the Publishing World: The novel "Miss Xue Ping" by Huo Xueming has been published by Jinwu Bookstore. It extensively explores the topic of love and expresses his personal views. Mr. Huo has also recently published "Understanding Love," a collection of essays priced at 25 cents, and "Goose," a collection of short stories priced at 35 cents. Both can be ordered by mail from the Shanghai Xiaodongmen Hunan Correspondence Society without postage.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments and Introductions: Mr. Wei Juezhong, who plans to travel the world by bicycle, has traveled all over Southeast Asia. Recently, he published a book in Shanghai called "Southern Wilderness Peoples," which is sold by the Oriental Bookstore at 306 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and the Beijiao Bookstore at 32 Sandeli, Baoshan Road. The book records very strange things, but they are indeed the author's personal experiences and notes taken at any time. We received a complimentary copy yesterday and would like to express our gratitude and introduce it.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Returning with Daoist to Lin Baohua's place at the Oriental Printing Company in Chinatown to visit Master Wan Hui. Master Wan is the younger brother of the literary figure Xie Wu-liang. He studied in India for twelve years, learned Sanskrit, and now teaches Chinese at Yangon University. He is proficient in English and Sanskrit and became a monk early on, using science and literature to connect Buddhist Zen. Many Westerners admire and learn from him. In the afternoon, Master Wan came to Lin's place, and his discussion of his learning was very profound and difficult to understand at once. He is truly a rare gem among Eastern scholars and deserves the respect of humans and gods. Master Wan said that Buddhist studies are in meditation, not like the empty talk of the Middle Kingdom. He studies English and Sanskrit to compare world languages and wants to create a new character that integrates Eastern and Western civilizations. If the country and society are strong, should they not help this great talent to accomplish an immortal career?</p>
<p>On the 28th, I woke up in the morning and saw many yellow-robed young monks walking around the street, holding alms bowls in their right hands. Many of them had beautiful faces. Occasionally, there were elderly monks, and I almost thought that Ananda and Kashyapa were everywhere. I got a poem:</p>
<p>Yellow robes come and go, Ananda is seen, holding an alms bowl and begging for a cold meal from door to door. Overthrowing the country is truly a strong man. Who says that dragons and elephants have withered?</p>
<p>Myanmar monks differ from Chinese monks in many ways. First, Myanmar monks are masculine and promote revolution. Their leader is U. Ottama, who traveled to Japan and recently returned due to illness. It is a pity that after he passed through Xiamen, no Chinese knew to contact him. There are 100,000 Myanmar monks, and it is said that there are many in the old capital of Mandalay. There are monks holding knives and sticks in front of the masses, and the British are also afraid of them.</p>
<p>On the 29th, there was a blind monk who said he had walked from Yunnan and was from Hubei. The blind man had no money and traveled thousands of miles but could not return home. However, it is strange that he was able to come. Chinese monks also wear yellow robes in Myanmar, but the Burmese do not respect them very much because they know that their precepts are not as good as Myanmar monks. And Chinese monks sometimes do very unseemly things. There is a Gao Wanbang here who is very respectful of monks. When a certain monk came, Gao put in a lot of effort to raise a lot of money, getting 5,000 yuan. Later, the monk married a Burmese woman and still did not leave. Gao was very embarrassed and regretted it. From then on, even if the monks were adulterous, he would not treat them politely. The Daoist said that the reason for their marriage was because the Burmese had a custom of touching their feet with their hands. However, it is said that the behavior of Myanmar monks, though said to be perfect, is only because the Burmese are devout in their belief in monks, even if they have it, they do not say it and do not change their belief. Master Wan said that Myanmar monks are clean and noble and rarely commit adultery, able to adhere to the rules left by Sakyamuni. If you go to a Myanmar monastery, it is common to see women there, but you should not suspect them of having other relationships, as they are often their family members. The reason why Burmese Buddhism has maintained the faith of its people to this day is because the monks can keep the precepts.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 15: Tears Stream Down in All Directions, Red Feelings of Sorrow; Hearts Open in One Place, Lingering Green Thoughts</p>
<p>The word "fate" in Buddhism is truly an unbreakable term. Whether it is a good fate or a bad fate, once it gets a hold of you, it is difficult to break free. Even the smallest thing has a fate within it. As the saying goes, "Those who are destined will meet across a thousand miles, while those who are not destined will not meet face to face." Zuo Shichen and Green Thoughts seem to have a little bit of fate. Even he himself does not understand where this fate comes from. Is it because Green Thoughts is like Ruiyun, and he appreciates Green Thoughts in memory of Ruiyun? But after becoming familiar with Green Thoughts, he felt that Green Thoughts was Green Thoughts and definitely not Ruiyun. Did he get a new interest and new love for Green Thoughts? But there are also more beautiful singing girls than Green Thoughts. Why does Zuo Shichen have a little bit of concern in his heart only for this little girl? Isn't this about the word "fate"? Moreover, later on, he gradually discovered that Green Thoughts had two quirks in her demeanor. One quirk was that she often used the tip of her tongue to lick her cherry lips. At least two or three times in every mirror scene. Zuo Shichen asked her why she did this. Was it because her lips were dry, so she used that fragrant saliva to moisten them? She said that she didn't even notice that it had become a habit of nature. But she also knew that she had this quirk and couldn't change it for a while. She hated herself deeply. According to her mother, she had been like this since she was a child. Sometimes, she would pinch the tip of her tongue because of this quirk, but she could never change it. A friend said that Green Thoughts's previous life must have been as snake reincarnated. When asked what the basis for this was, he said that he had once heard a famous storyteller named Wu Xigeng say in a book called "The Legend of the White Snake" that the white snake spirit transformed into a peerless beauty and came to repay her gratitude. The storyteller, famous for his subtlety, described the demeanor of the peerless beauty, the White Maiden, as also saying that her clove-like tongue sometimes stretched outwards. He also said that this was a kind of original appearance of a snake. Isn't a snake's tongue frequently stretched outwards? Based on that kind of nonsense, that friend also said that Green Thoughts was a snake reincarnated. That was originally a joke, but Zuo Shichen's heart was clouded, but he didn't say that she was ugly. Instead, he felt that it increased her charm. He argued that there are three things in the world that hate mediocrity the most: one is landscape, the second is writing, and the third is beauty. You want a thousand cliffs and ravines, flying waterfalls and dangerous cliffs, to show the world's majesty. If it is flat, wouldn't it be better for nature to create this world without mountains and water, just a flat plain? As for writing, it is the same. If you give it a comment saying that it is flat and flawless, then there is no need to write this article to waste ink. The ancient saying "Writing is like looking at mountains, it does not like flatness" cannot be said to be meaningless. As for beauty, he also has an argument.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Precious Metals Market Spiked Last Week <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The trend of the precious metals market last week was sharp, but with many changes. It was difficult to grasp the situation due to confusing and uncertain news, which made people feel alienated. The fluctuations were between three or four taels or six or seven taels per day. As for the rest of the market and exchange rates, there was a slight rotation. On Monday (November 17th), the large silver bars continued to rise, so the spot price for the current month was slightly lower, opening at 77.5 taels. After that, it fluctuated by more than one tael. In the afternoon, it was suddenly reported that Hamaguchi's injuries were critical, and Yuanxing, Yongyuan, Chengyong, Hongli, and others dumped their holdings, causing a sudden drop to 76.5 taels. As a result, it rebounded by one tael and closed at 77.6 qian, slightly lower than last Saturday. On this day, the fluctuation was only around three taels, and the exchange rate was still stable. The next day, the silver market contracted, and the exchange rate was reduced by half a point. The internal market was also strong, with Chinese merchants buying, so the precious metals market stepped onto the blue clouds and suddenly broke through the 80-tael mark. The opening was 80.08 taels. It was said that the United States was inclined to buy silver bars, and it was also heard that Hamaguchi was fine, especially Hengxing and Shengda, who traded heavily. Around noon, it rose to more than 85 taels. Cuita, Jiutai, Fuxingyong, Yuda, Yongfeng, and others came to buy. In the afternoon, it was also heard that banks in the United States had collapsed to prevent large silver bars from falling, and the exchange rate in Mumbai repeatedly reported small amounts. Therefore, the major players in the market competed to buy, and it actually rose to 87 taels. The difference between the high and low prices of the market was more than six taels. On Wednesday, the silver market continued to fall, and the exchange rate was reduced by half a point. Chenfengyong, Yongfeng, Wupin, and others competed to buy, causing a sudden surge to 90.2 qian during the expansion. The Indian conference was feared to raise the silver market, and Xieyu, Fuchang, Lichang, and others successively dumped their holdings, and then immediately broke through the 90-tael mark. In the afternoon, the other party was still mostly only 83.4 taels. The closing price was 84.2 qian, which was a reaction against the trend of the previous day, falling by 2.7 qian. On this day, the difference between the high and low prices was nearly 7 taels. The situation was almost one of a clear tightening and a hidden loosening, and the drifting of the market conditions was really difficult to guess. The next day, the market conditions changed slightly by three or four taels. In the morning, the market was still stable due to the rise in large silver bars, and the opening price was still at 84 taels, but then it went down by two taels due to Xinxing selling. Afterwards, rumors spread that the Sino-American loan had failed, and the market was boosted, rising sharply to 86 taels. However, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others came out again to sell, and Hengxingshengda also had sales, so the closing price was within 84 taels, down 3 qian from the previous day. Although the Xianling listed price was up by half a point, the difference between the clear and hidden prices was vast. Chinese merchants still had buying, so the internal market seemed strong. The next day, the large silver bars rose again, and Xianling did not change. However, the internal market was slightly tight, and each gold shop continued to buy without stopping. Therefore, the precious metals market had rebounded by more than two taels. The major players all entered from 84 taels in the morning to 88.5 taels in the evening. However, in the end, Yuanxingyong, Fuchang, and others competed to sell, and in an instant, it fell by more than two taels to close at 6.1 qian, which was still up 2.2 qian from the previous day. On Saturday, the large silver bars rebounded, and Xianling shrank by half a point. The internal market was also strong, and the precious metals market rose early due to the United States' inclination to sell copper coins. The market was high, and then rose to 88.9 qian. There were many buyers. Xieyu and Yuanheng then sold, and it fell by two taels. Afterwards, the price rose and fell between 87 and 88 taels. By noon, it was 89 taels, and the closing price was 89 qian, which was up 2.8 qian from the previous day. The difference between the high and low prices in half a day was 2.1 qian. The market atmosphere was still favorable. However, the transactions of each shop were very different. Here are the high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as the listing prices of exchange rates:</p>

<p>Yesterday (Sunday), there were no reports from the foreign exchange market. However, according to the London telegram, there was no change in the price of large silver bars. The near-term price was still 16 pence 625 (equivalent to British gold 1 shilling 7 pence 6875), and the far-term price was still 16.5 pence. The market situation was stagnant. Also, according to the New York telegram, the price of American silver fell by 0.125, with the spot price being 35 and 75/100 cents. The ratio to the Mexican dollar was still 4 dollars 8 and 532/1000 cents. The American-British exchange rate fell by 0.0625 to 4 dollars 8 and 556/1000 cents. The Japanese-American exchange rate was still 49 and 625/1000 cents yuan. The British-British exchange rate was still 2 shillings 0 and 17/32. The Shanghai Xianling short fell by 0.0625 to 1 shilling 7 pence 3125. The Mumbai spot price was still 47 rupees 07.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the banks were closed as usual, but the interest rate market made various prices. The Yangli continued to fall repeatedly. The early market Yangli was 7 qian 2 fen 4 and half li, which was down 3 hao 7 and half li from the previous day. The noon market fell slightly by 7 hao and half li to 7 qian 2 fen 3 and 7 and half li hao. As a result, it fell by more than 1 li compared to the previous day. The silver interest rate in the morning and noon markets was the same, 1 qian 8 fen, which was up 8 fen from the previous day. However, the market atmosphere was very calm, and there were no special signs. The Yangkuan transaction in the early market was only 255,000 yuan, and the noon market was only 220,000 yuan. The banknotes were only 20,000 yuan in the noon market. The outside banknotes were only 40,000 yuan in the early market. The Yanggong single received more than 3.9 million yuan from Qianzhuang, and the silver public single received more than 33 million yuan. The transaction of small Qianzhuang was more than 300,000 yuan. The Jiangnan Xiaoyang was 6 qian 4 fen 3 li in the morning and noon. The transaction in the early market was 3,000 jiao, and the noon market was 1,500 jiao. The Guangdong Xiaoyang was 6 qian 4 fen 1 li 7 hao and half li in the morning market and 6 qian 4 fen 1 li 6 hao in the noon market. The transaction was 110,000 jiao in the early market and 75,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins rose slightly, with 500 wen being 382,500 wen. The transaction was 34,500 strings.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Cause and Effect of High Interest Rates and Low Yangli <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver interest rate suddenly tightened, which attracted the attention of various businesses. Here is what I have heard. The reason for the loose silver in the past was due to the National Lunar Year closing issues and watching. Now, it is heard that the industries are generally consistent in ending the National Year, and Qianzhuang expresses sympathy to it. At present, they can engage in collecting arrears, and those who lack a share will inevitably be requested. In addition, yesterday was Sunday, and the banks closed, and the lining could not circulate, resulting in this result. As for the fall in Yangli, it was purely due to stagnant digestion and pressure from the tight silver. The banks did not dare to buy more, and there was no news of the foreign line going to the stomach. A reactionary impression suddenly arose in the market, and the result was a fall of thousands of miles, becoming yesterday's decline.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Securities Market: The Bond Market Was Booming Last Week <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The prices were firm and strong…Transactions totaled more than 63 million yuan</p>
<p>The bond market in this city last week saw a slight increase in spot transactions compared to the previous period, but trading was still sparse. The total turnover for the week was 132,500 yuan, including 45,500 yuan for reorganized and demobilized soldiers, 12,000 yuan for finance, 29,000 yuan for the 19 Customs, 10,000 yuan for the 96 bonds, and only a few thousand yuan for other bonds. Futures were better than the previous week, and daily transactions were quite active. The first day of the week reached more than 16.4 million yuan, and the next two days were around 1 to 2 million yuan. On Thursday, it was also more than 9.1 million yuan, and on the last two days of the weekend, it was about 7 million yuan each. The total turnover for the week was 62,825,000 yuan, which was more than 9 million yuan more than the previous week. The 9-year Customs was similar to the previous week, totaling 5,565,000 yuan for November and 10,099,000 yuan for December. The 96 reorganized and demobilized soldiers were more active than the previous week, totaling 4,440,000 yuan for November and 10,515,000 yuan for November. The reorganized and demobilized soldiers totaled 3,950,000 yuan for November and 8,060,000 yuan for December. The reorganized soldiers totaled 3,965,000 yuan for November and 7,970,000 yuan for December. However, other bonds remained quiet. The whole 6 Aftermath 19-volume and other bonds were clearer than before. The whole 6 bonds totaled 730,000 yuan for November and 1,770,000 yuan for December. The 19-year cigarette bond totaled 655,000 yuan for November and 495,000 yuan for December. The Customs bond totaled 1,420,000 yuan for November and 2,430,000 yuan for December. The Aftermath bond totaled 410,000 yuan for November and 25,000 yuan for December. The Financial bond totaled 100,000 yuan for November and 260,000 yuan for December. The 7-year 50,000 yuan bond and the continued 2 and 5 were calculated at 10,000 yuan. There was no market for the continued volume. The market situation of each bond in December was much more active than in November because the futures transactions in November were approaching settlement, and each was engaged in swap settlement. In the past week, the price trend of each bond was very good due to the increasing stability of the current situation and the reorganization of domestic and foreign debts, which was welcomed by general investors in government bonds. Therefore, the bond market environment was very good, so the price continued to rise compared to the previous period. As a result, only the reorganized and demobilized soldiers, 96 finance, and Aftermath bonds were only a few jiao higher than the previous week, and the 19-volume bonds were higher than before. The 19-volume and reorganized and demobilized bonds were the most in demand, continuing to rise by 2 to 3 yuan, and the Customs and whole 6 bonds rose by 1 yuan. The current price of the 96 and 19-year Customs government bonds has exceeded 6 yuan. The situation in the bond market is very good. The high and low price statistics and fluctuations of each bond in the past week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e202">Cotton Yarn Market Weaker After Initial Strength Last Week <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was still strong at the beginning of the week because raw cotton had a squeeze on the near month. The Yunnan gang was more active, which boosted morale. However, the actual demand was not sustainable, and each gang was lifeless. Moreover, the bottom goods inevitably increased. The five blessings and shepherd cotton yarn were particularly heavily stocked, and the trend became more sluggish. Therefore, the other party's attitude was calm, and in fact, the overall situation was more pessimistic. Because of this, people's hearts were scattered. Midway through the week, a certain manufacturer adopted a negative attitude and successively sold off the long positions. The market plate was even more loose. The trading on the floor was also deserted throughout the week. The demand for current cotton yarn was bleak. If the spot sales could not be sustained for a long time, the future would still be difficult to secure.</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Near Month of Hankou Standard Cotton Tended to Be Squeezed Last Week <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the cotton market saw too many November transactions, and the retail investors were short, anticipating that there would be insufficient delivery, so the buying side had the idea of squeezing the near month. Therefore, the near month was tight and not released, and the far month was agitated. This month, the far month has seen as high as 32 taels and 2 and a half qian, but in fact, there has been no improvement. Therefore, Japanese merchants sold off. Not long after, the US financial sector experienced a major panic, and the US cotton fell slightly. The atmosphere suddenly became vacant, and the market suddenly fell by 5 or 6 qian. However, the Ningbo gang and the Shanghai gang were still reluctant to let go of their purchases due to the harassment of Hankou Road by bandits, which made the source still scarce. However, in terms of the world situation, Indian cotton is cheap, and Chinese and foreign factories have large orders for days. Chinese cotton transactions have completely occupied it, and future changes may not be small. US cotton fell by 25 pounds compared to last week, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Foreign Cotton Market Slightly Recovered <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was firm. Initially, it was firm due to short covering, and later due to profit-taking by some longs. Futures prices fluctuated by one to five points. Spot prices for American cotton remained unchanged. English cotton futures rose by two points, while spot prices fell by two points. Spot prices for Egyptian cotton remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market saw Japanese merchants buying both near and far-term Pingguoer futures. Bai Luo and Han futures both fell by one point. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 22nd).</p>

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the supply from the inland gradually decreased because the continuous sharp decline in this port had caused significant losses to traders, leading them to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The producing market initially followed the situation in Shanghai, but the downstream market then turned firm due to inquiries from merchants. The number of rice boats heading to Shanghai decreased. However, at the start of the morning market, the shops in this street were eager, and the new japonica market became active. Prices rose sharply by ten cents. The price of Zhongguan rice had to rise by as much as forty cents. Special top-grade japonica rice rose to about fifteen yuan and thirty cents. Unfortunately, such goods were very scarce in the market. The Bo Tao market was slightly tight. The Yang Xian followed the japonica market, rising by twenty cents. Du Jian rose by one and a half to two and a half cents. The price increase was extremely loose because after frequent fatigue, once the trend improved, the reaction was bound to be intense. The supply of good-quality rice in this port was scarce and stable. Special high-quality rice opened at about twelve yuan and sold well. Chang Jin and Dao Yuan rice both reached fifteen yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the supply from the river area started sluggish, then became active. Chang Bang white rice initially continued the momentum from the previous day, and selling was very strong. Prices showed a downward trend. Later, upon receiving news from the north that prices were rising, the situation became active. However, the market had already fluctuated by one or two cents. Special top-grade high-quality japonica rice opened at fourteen and a half yuan, and the retail sales of various Jiangsu and Tong japonica rice were slightly active. Prices showed little gain or loss. Those with high prices still had hope for improvement. In the South Bang area, the wholesale volume of Tao Wu was quite sufficient at noon, then slightly stabilized. Top-grade goods hovered around thirteen yuan. This product market was the least active. There was a lack of high-quality Yang Du Xian rice, and rural sales continued. The market was stable, and the Yuan Exchange went well. New arrivals were gradually being connected to large-scale purchases, and all were showing firm sales.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Silk and Tea: Last Week's Silk Market Was Dull and Lifeless <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Overseas silk sales almost came to a standstill. Domestic silk mills' sales were not smooth.</p>
<p>Yokohama raw silk prices fell even more drastically. The future of the silk market is increasingly bleak.</p>
<p>Last week, although the party strife in the New York market subsided, it was followed by natural disasters: heavy snow and strong winds, with unusually cold weather. Major floods in Lyon were disastrous, and the economy was generally unstable. The number of silk mills that suspended operations increased daily, and raw silk sales decreased. Factory sales were stagnant, and silk prices continued to weaken. In Yokohama, sales at the three silk exchanges were halted, and prices fell even more drastically. In Shanghai, the white silk factories could not transfer to foreign firms via European telegrams, and completely stopped. Only on the weekend did inland silk mills have a slight need for medium- to low-grade yellow and white silks, but the volume was limited. The labor unrest in all Shanghai silk mills had just subsided, and only about thirty single and double palace silk mills were barely resuming work. Because the cost of silk itself was not loose, and the prices from Europe and the United States differed by two or three hundred taels, the future of the silk market became even more tragic. The entire week only saw the transaction of just over one hundred packages of Sichuan dried silk, and the price was also low. Current silk exports were just over seven hundred packages. Overseas silk prices all fell. Here is a list of the Hua silk prices in the US and French markets at the end of last week (New York price per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: French francs):</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Lyon Silk Type New York Lyon</p>
<p>High-Grade Shanghai Silk 2.75 286 Top-Grade Dried Silk 2.00 72</p>

<p>Production prices continue to rise by four or five yuan.</p>
<p>Another telegram: The inventory of marine stagnant production areas is sufficient, and the market is difficult to turn around. Another ship with more than 20,000 packages will be shipped directly to Shanghai and is expected to arrive around the 10th of next month.</p>
<p>Telegram from Hong Kong: Pepper. According to the Le production market, it has risen by 3 shields and 75 cents compared to before.</p>
