<h3>上海的一般</h3>
<p>— 志靜</p>
<p>洪佩青編　光明出版部發行　大光真美善各書店代售</p>
<p>上海是神秘的神秘得變化萬端使人難以捉摸上海亦是偉大的偉大的支配力可及於全中國非單全中國或許更要廣遠些總之上海是上海上海是佔全世界最大都巿的第六位土海就值得注意了何况我們又是日夕在上海的區域裏和上海所包羅的一切的一切而斡旋着</p>
<p>上海即就是我們現在所立足的上海我們到外灘南京路上一帶去就可以看到矗立着的高大洋房到黄浦江濱去還可以看到許許多多的外國商船和外國兵艦在巨大的外國商船和兵艦的旁邊或許還可以找到次幾等的而毫無威風的船隻以及裝着幾尊好像是砲的樣子的兵艦那就是我們中國的商船和兵艦在馬路上我們又可以看到流梭不息的電車·汽車·自由車·黄包車·以及各種的車游龍似地飛駛着更有熙熙攘攘的行人也似乎是都有要事在身似地飛跑着走過假使你有功夫的話請到南京路自然不單祇是南京路你肯從今天這時起站到明天的這時止總不會得使你失望總會給你不停一分一杪的時間都能看到來往的車輛和行人總之一切的一切都是和别的地方不同比别的地方點綴得美麗裝璜得好看佈置得華貴好的比别的地方多壞的也比别的地方多文化比别的地方發達而同時一切的病態的現象也就比别的地方特别的來得多這就是神秘的上海亦就是偉大的上海</p>
<p>但我們所能看到的只是上海的實現即就是上海的現實也夠我們的調查採訪了不過上海還有一件最值得注意的上海是畸形發展的這種畸形發展的歷史更是值得我們的探討因畸形發展的結果弄成「一國三公」的狀態萬惡的社會事實也就在外人的羽翼下滋張着中國行政權司法權行使的阻礙也就在外人侵佔勢力中成了無法執行的恥辱因之就種下五卅慘案的遠因從五卅慘案發生後一般民衆也就漸漸地覺悟了要爲民族獨立而奮鬥急切的問題就是要求收回租界</p>
<p>「上海的一般」的目的也就是這樣的他在「總說」中明白地告訴我們上海是西洋人强占中國一塊土地去硬造成功的一個都巿所以上海的發展是畸形的發展因之上海的一切也無一不是畸形的這種畸形的結果就給中國一個莫大的致命傷給我們中國人一種莫大的笖辱爲發展上海計爲洗滌我國的恥辱計作者也在本書中高喊着非收回租界不可就希望全上海的巿民都致力於租界的收回</p>
<p>本書的内容就是依照他的目的來講述上海的沿革以及其現狀使我們知道上海的一個大概情形認識上海的活動的一個輪廓全書分八篇從上海略史講起直說到上海一切的社會現象</p>
<p>枉住在上海多年的我倘使有人問起我關於上海的歷史以及所以發展的原動力我定會瞠目不知所答「上海略史」一篇就解决了我這個問題他從宋熙寗七年距今巳有八百六十餘年了的時候談起那時的上海還祗稍有人家祗不過是一個小鎮後來漸漸地變成爲縣漸漸地被外人注目漸漸地被外人侵佔漸漸地訂爲通商口岸更漸漸地漸漸地就一了現在如是這般的上海中間外人的得寸進寸得尺進尺的伸張以致施無憚忌而加之我國從前官吏的無能國人的漠不關心讀之真會令人傷心痛絶</p>
<p>「上海的文化」一章尤爲全書中值得注意的一章上海旣是畸形的發展上海的文化也就當然的是畸形的發展上海又是洋人的世界所以上海的文化也就帶着十足的洋臭味所謂中國受文化的侵略最顯著的自然也就在上海本篇抓住了這個中心意識所以關於外人所組織的文化團體以及文化上的設施特别地調查得精密特别地說得詳盡他非單是揭穿外人文化侵略的野心他更揭穿了中國人在文化侵略下其自甘做奴才的劣根性受着這種影響所及弄得在中國人自巳的談話間也會應用着英語忘却自巳是中國人忘却中國是還有中國話的真是不知是何心肝文化侵略的可怕我們自然可以覺悟了本篇最後的一節是講「言語與輿論」上海言語的種類多而複雜真夠可觀了但作者同時又告訴我們說假使你是什麽話都不會說得你亦可以在上海生活得非常適意他以事實來證明寫得很滑稽而有趣這亦可見上海的神秘了</p>
<p>還有一篇「上海的病態」告訴我們上海是萬惡社會的淵藪因之上海的病態也就要比别的地方特别的來得多而且花樣也特别地巧妙而調查的結論中又告訴我們關於盜刦和綁票的案件都是租界内要比華界來得多租界的内幕究竟是怎樣更是究竟怎樣地保障人民那就值得我們的玩味了單就某月份調查的結果自殺竟有二百三十七件盜案竟有一百十三件綁案計十四起還有許多没有調查得到的呢這是都麽可怕的上海呵</p>
<p>本書中還滿載着照片和吳友如等諸畫家的作品占全書一半有餘每幅裏都襯着照片或畫片在這許多照片畫片中更使我們可以認識過去的上海現在的上海以及將來上海的趨勢我們深深地認識上海是有偉大的革命史蹟其次我們又能看到上海這許多偉大的建築都是從中國各地源源不絶地榨取着金錢來造成的百同時亦都就是外人咀吸我們中國人血液的塲所我們該深深地認識了我們該深深地覺悟了吧再不是我們可以沉醉於繁華享樂的上海的時候了這就是我看完「上海的一般」的感想也就是要介紹給閱者的用意</p>
<h3>民間文藝</h3>
<p>— 湯增敭</p>
<p>彚刋第一册</p>
<p>國立中山大學語言歷史學研究所出版</p>
<p>在我們中國一般學者對於最可寳貴的最偉大的「民間文藝」素所忽視如果說是加以深刻的研究更其是罕若所聞在不久之前曾經有少數學者漸漸地注意於「民間文藝」的探討與徵集這實是在中國學術界可以算是一種極良好的現象他們能夠從民衆的口述演進到書本上記載遺留於今後使一般愛好文藝的人都有機會來鑑賞這真正的民間文藝真的「在東西各國對於民間文藝的研究都巳有許多的專書而目前對於中國的民間文藝如歐美人士之採集神話傳說日本學者之研究謡諺謎語也都有宏篇鉅製的成績發表這實在使我們汗顔而且要加倍努力的因爲我們對於自巳伯救兄弟諸姑姊妹的生活·思想·文藝反没有外人知道的詳悉啊」這是彚刋中「爲民間文藝敬告讀者」的一段話使我們讓了是多麽應該激起發奮的心對於我國的「民間文藝」須毫不遲疑地加倍的努力起來</p>
<p>民間文藝周刋是國立第一中山大學語言歷史學研究所同人努力「民間文藝」一種成績的結晶這種研究民間文藝的毅力委實值我們特異的讚美現在他們把創刋號起至十二號止彚刋起來使我們獲得系統的觀察</p>
<p>内容極形豐富有各地的山歌關於梅縣的採集尤多其它如屬於東莞·撞人·等等不易獲見的歌謡亦有少許的徵集這等鄉壤裏的民間作品實屬分外的珍貴關於河南的謎語富春的民諺濡須的農歌江山的童謡蛋户的蠻歌象縣的兒歌閩謡以及廣州的巫歌都有收集又有潮州傳說中國古代幾個鳥的傳說羊石傳說白鵝潭傳說陳夢吉的傳說等都有詳盡的刋載還有灶神故事林大欽的故事鳥的故事古人中的故事英台山伯與南一士子的故事呆女婿的故事與及惠州塔的神話漣水塔的神話…差不多屬於民間文學的如歌謡·謎語·笑話·傳記·神話·故事等等都有儘量的蒐集成爲民間文藝的寳藏並且關於英語的童歌間亦有所譯述藉此使我們可以把國外的「民間文藝」與我國的作一個比較的研究這種介紹的工作真是異常的偉大所以他們曾經這樣的說</p>
<p>在我們的眼眶中歌謡·諺語·的價值不亞於宋詞·唐詩·故事傳說的重要不下於正史·通鑑·寓言·笑話·不讓於莊生東方的滑稽小曲·唱書·不劣於崑腔樂府的美妙因爲這是民族精神所寄託這是平民文化的表現我們爲此而徵集·發表·整理·研究中國全民族的各種文藝這也就是本刋所負的唯一使命</p>
<p>由此我們可以知道該所同人發印本刋的旨趣固然是以研究「民間文藝」爲前提使人我們明瞭「民間文藝」在文學上所佔的重要位置實超過從文人手裏所創造出來的文學同時該所同人研究「民間文藝」是以發揚民族精神爲出發點的他們所負的使命是探討中國全民族的各種文藝這種富有民族思想的概念委實使我們欽佩讚美</p>
<p>他們在整理方面也盡了不少的力有如刋載一首「狼獞謡歌」在篇末旣加上了詳細的脚註在篇首又有具體的以研究的心得而添上正確的說明這種嚴肅的研求的態度也是他們所具有的唯一的優點關於各地的戀歌這裏面收集亦不少但這種戀歌决不像一般頽廢文人所作感傷成分很濃厚的戀歌因它完全是屬於熱情的流露今錄幾首於下以便愛好文藝者的探討</p>
<p>象縣戀歌</p>
<p>鳥也不知魚在水</p>
<p>魚也不知鳥在山</p>
<p>妹也不知哥想妹</p>
<p>誰知想妹斷肝腸</p>
<p>包袱雨傘上了肩</p>
<p>回頭望妹涙漣漣</p>
<p>情哥願食斷腸草</p>
<p>不願分離各一邊</p>
<p>合浦民間戀歌</p>
<p>心裏戚戚肚裏孤</p>
<p>夜睡空牀蓆無敷</p>
<p>三魂七魄跟妹走</p>
<p>問姊夜睡見郎無</p>
<p>八月十五望月光</p>
<p>家中無米望禾黄</p>
<p>十八小姑望日子</p>
<p>單身小弟望成雙</p>
<p>在這兩首戀歌裏可以看出有的是懇切地要求得異性的表示有的是入了初戀時期的渴慕從心泉中流出的愛之歌音同時可以看出合浦鄉間的人們底性情實是兩首優美的歌又如</p>
<p>昨日前日妹回調</p>
<p>剩隻脚跡在沙洲</p>
<p>見隻脚跡無見妹</p>
<p>眼涙猶如江水流</p>
<p>這是表示青年情侣别離的情景很自然的流露出這樣的真情語並不像一般文人所寫的詩詞那樣的感傷關於這一點又不得不推崇「民間文學」的偉大其價值由此也可明白一斑了</p>
<p>其餘值得歌頌的戀歌實不在少數並且有許多關於文丐的傳說大都是屬於珍貴而不易得這裏因爲篇幅的關係未能一一徵引出來以共同好實憾事也</p>
<p>最後我們要曉得民間文藝的内涵是何等的豐富」有許許多多的重要材料可以供給社會學·人類學·歷史學·語言學·民俗學·宗敎學·敎育學·心理學各種學者的專門研究」在文藝的方面講民間不知道埋没過多少具有天才的無名文學家他們有許多艶歌妙語閒情逸事不住的在流傳着倘能將此採輯之後加以整理以供大家欣賞實有無上的意義方面的</p>
<p>「民間文藝」是代表民族的文藝在現今我們應該急切地提倡起來使一般愛好文藝的青年向這方面來發掘這册」民間文藝彚刋一是巳發現的民間文藝的寳藏委實值得推荐的</p>

<h3>Central Army's Great Advance on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line</h3>
<p>Left Wing Army Pursues to Feicheng</p>
<p>Right Wing Army Presses Near Laiwu</p>
<p>Tai'an Encircled on Three Sides</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianren, Head of the First Propaganda Brigade, Cables the General Political Training Department: (1) Since our army launched a general offensive on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, braving strong winds and rain, we have advanced bravely, successively capturing three lines of enemy defense. In five days, we crossed the Dawen River, occupied the line of Xintai, Liulilou, Dezhangxia, and approached Tai'an. The enemy is collapsing in disarray, and Tai'an is within easy reach. (2) Our army had surrounded Tai'an on three sides by 6:00 PM. The enemy fled towards Jinan via Daxiaowan. Our left wing army has pursued to Feicheng, and our right wing army has pressed near Laiwu. The air force is bombing the routed troops in shifts all day long. Many prisoners have been captured in this battle, and the annihilation of the Jin army is imminent. (7th)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Chief of Staff's Office of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, Ma Youliu, Cables Beijing: After our armies suppressing the rebellion on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line converged between Qufu, Yanzhou, Jining, and Ningyang, they began their attack on the eastern front on the 1st. The enemy initially relied on fortifications in the area of ​​Nanyang and Nanyi to resist fiercely. After our officers and soldiers fought bravely and fiercely, they broke through the enemy's forward positions and followed closely, pressing closer step by step. After engaging in close combat, by the 3rd, they completely broke through the enemy's main line of defense. The rebel army's front line collapsed. On the 4th, our armies had advanced to the vicinity of Tai'an, Feicheng, and Pingyin. Countless people drowned in the water due to the rain and the sudden rise of the Wen River. The situation of their defeat was extremely embarrassing. It has been verified that in this battle, the rebel army's Zhang Huizhao's troops, Fu Zuoyi's troops, Zhou Kangjian's division, and Ye Qijie's division were captured by our left wing army, totaling over 6,000 people, and over 30 artillery pieces and over 2,000 rifles were seized. The two divisions of Li Shengda's army, Huo and Duan, were captured by our central army, totaling over 5,300 people, and over 50 artillery pieces and over 4,000 rifles were seized. Feng Yuxi's security division and Chen Changhan's division of Li Shengda's troops were captured by our right wing army, totaling approximately 8,000 people, and 43 mortars and over 5,000 rifles were seized. After this heavy blow, the rebel troops on the Tianjin-Pukou front have suffered heavy casualties. Now, in addition to the various divisions on the front line continuing to pursue the victory, two divisions of troops have been dispatched to advance along the river from Pingyin, directly attacking the flanks of Jinan, determined to annihilate all the enemies south of the Yellow River in a short period of time.

Our army has intercepted countless military supplies and captured countless prisoners. The Longhai rebel army, in order to coordinate with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, has launched desperate attacks yesterday and today. According to a telephone call from the front, the rebel enemy suffered a major setback last night, with corpses piled up in front of the trenches, emitting an unbearable stench. The rebel enemy has no more courage to come again. The rebel army on the Jiaoji Railway attacked the Wei River yesterday and has been defeated by the Han army.

The two divisions of Sun Liangcheng's troops, Liang Guanying and Cheng Xinming, were almost completely wiped out. The rebel army's so-called Iron Army, Ji Hongchang's troops, also suffered two-thirds casualties. (2) After the general offensive on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, we braved strong winds and rain and advanced fiercely, successively capturing three enemy defense lines. On the 1st, we occupied the line of Xintai, Gonglilou, Dexia and Zhang. (3) On the 5th, our central army had encircled Tai'an. The left wing crossed Feicheng, and the right wing took Laiwu.

<p>Military News: (1) On the 6th, the enemy's Qin Shaoguan's troops on the right wing of Tai'an engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with our Jiang Guangnai's division, resulting in many casualties on both sides. Jiang's division had extremely strong combat power, and the enemy army was also quite stubborn, falling and rising again, with men and horses lying on top of each other. In the end, our division broke through the enemy's position and withdrew from Guanluzhuang, fleeing towards Tai'an. (2) After occupying Gongli in the central route, Chen Cheng's division engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy Zhang Huizhao's troops in Loudi Town. The enemy, due to being constrained by all sides, had withdrawn from the town. Our army took advantage of the victory to advance towards Xiaoquan and Lianhuayu. (3) Xia Douyin's and Ma Hongkui's divisions have been advancing rapidly on the front for several days. The enemy has abandoned the defensive positions south of Tai'an and retreated under cover. Our front has already connected with the left wing army and is jointly attacking Tai'an. A part of Liu Zhi's troops is responsible for wiping out the remaining rebels.

<p>Someone went to the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railway lines to inspect the battle situation. According to a return, on the Tianjin-Pukou front, the Central Army launched a general offensive on the 1st, occupying the northern heights of Nanyi. On the 5th, they advanced to the Wen River, with the main force marching towards Ningyang and Feicheng on the left side of the railway to prevent the Northern Army from approaching Tai'an. There has been heavy rain in the area for several days, making it inconvenient to advance, but the situation of the Central Army is indeed favorable. The strength of the two sides in that area is five divisions of the Jin Army and ten divisions of the Central Army. On the Longhai Line, the front line is on a straight line in the east of Jiukaocheng, Minquan County, Suixian County, and Taikang. One hundred regiments of the Jin Army and one hundred and twenty regiments of the Central Army are facing each other, but the battle situation in this area remains unchanged.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Indian Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>The rise and fall, survival and death, of a nation and a people are separated by only a slight margin. Next to flourishing is decline, and next to survival is death. Conversely, next to death is survival, and next to decline is flourishing. Therefore, when a country and a people are struggling to survive, they will inevitably gather thousands of hardships and difficulties to oppress them. If they do not overcome this oppression, they will certainly not survive and will perish. If they can overcome this oppression, they will not only not perish, but they will also move away from the path of decline and enter the path of flourishing. Moreover, if a country and a people can struggle to survive, even if there are thousands of hardships and oppression, they will ultimately survive more and perish less. Therefore, a country and a people struggling to survive do not need to worry about the number of hardships and difficulties. Why? The more hardships and difficulties there are, the more unwavering the spirit is. In the eyes of ordinary people, their success is more difficult, but in reality, it is easier. Why? With single-minded struggle and no desire for luck or help, their success can already be assured. Moreover, after success, they stand on extremely solid ground and have no future worries. Looking at the rise of various countries and peoples in the world, it is all due to this.</p>
<p>The hardships and difficulties of India's current anti-British movement can be said to be extreme. In addition to anti-British sentiment, there is also the religious conflict between Hindus and Muslims, and the great flood has added to the suffering. Natural and man-made disasters have occurred simultaneously, but to this day, the spirit of independence has not diminished in the slightest. This is why we know that it will inevitably succeed.</p>
<p>National Important Telegrams Two</p>
<p>Hunanese Refugees Petition, Tan Yankai's Response</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Wu Yanji and other representatives of Hunanese refugees who fled to Hankou have been petitioning in Beijing in separate groups for several days. On the morning of the 7th, they met with Tan Yankai and told him that although Changsha has been recovered, He Jian's military strength that can be mobilized to suppress the Communists is less than ten regiments. In addition to the two regiments sent by the headquarters and the headquarters' branch, there are only over 10,000 people in total. On the Communist side, there are over 30,000 people with guns and spears. Although they have withdrawn from Changsha this time, if a large army is not dispatched to thoroughly suppress them, I am afraid that the disaster will not end. Therefore, many refugees who have fled abroad do not dare to return to Hunan. Tan said that the unprecedented tragedy that Changsha has suffered this time is heartbreaking. The central government has decided on a concrete plan and will appoint He Jingzhi to be responsible for suppressing bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The issue of rehabilitation is very important. At present, many people are attacking He Jian for the loss of Changsha to Zhang Guizai and then to the Communists. Because He Jian has always been negligent, he has made mistakes. The responsibility for guarding the territory is unforgivable. However, the current situation in Hunan cannot be settled without He Jian. Because the Communist flames are growing daily, no one but the existing military force can handle it. Therefore, the premise must be to suppress the Communists, save Hunan, and appease the displaced people. Other issues cannot be discussed yet. What should be paid special attention to is that during this time when the Communists entered the city, ignorant people either supported them from within or were forced to join the riots. If they are not distinguished and are all implicated, not only will it be impossible to punish them all, but it will also easily force them to take a wrong path and give the Communist Party an opportunity, which is very dangerous. A detailed investigation is especially needed. Those who are confirmed to be Communists should be killed without mercy. Those who were coerced into blindly following must be given an opportunity for self-renewal. This point should be led and carried out by the party department. The people of Hunan must quickly realize that those who have money should contribute money to buy guns and ammunition, and those who have strength should contribute their strength to serve as militia. Those with experience should preside over the matter. In the event of a bandit disaster, they can suppress it themselves without relying on external forces. There are many clues regarding rehabilitation matters, and I, as a member of Hunan, will assist the central government in planning as much as possible. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>U.S. Navy Department Expands Air Plans</p>
<p>Creating One Thousand Aircraft in Five Years</p>
<p>Proposal Under Consideration</p>
<h3>Washington, Associated Press, 6th</h3>
<p>According to today's news, the U.S. Navy Department is considering a proposal requesting congressional approval to proceed with a new plan to build one thousand aircraft in five years. The estimated cost is approximately US$85,000,000. The original aircraft construction plan was established in 1925. This proposal aims to supplement that plan. It is expected that President Hoover, although recently striving to reduce government expenses, may approve this case because it is necessary to establish the U.S. air force's armaments in comparison with other powers.</p>

<h3>The German President's Statement</h3>
<p>Only Seeking Political Stability</p>
<p>Not Concerned with Party Politics</p>
<h3>Berlin, National Society, 6th</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from this agency who is close to the German President, if the results of this congressional election do not meet the President's expectations, the President has no intention of resigning, nor has he ever considered it. The President's daily wishes and sincere hopes are only for political stability, so that the economy and social life can be stabilized accordingly. As for how to combine parties to realize this wish, the President has never put his heart into it. Moreover, the President's position in the Constitution is detached, and he should not be concerned with party politics. All current rumors that do not conform to this basic concept are not true.</p>
<h3>American Food Soars</h3>
<p>Speculators Active</p>
<p>Drought Still Inevitable</p>
<h3>New York, Reuters, 6th</h3>
<p>Farmland east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States is greatly affected by severe drought. Speculators on Wall Street, etc., have received this news and have abandoned the securities and other commodity markets and gathered at the food exchange. As a result, the price of sorghum has soared, setting a new record for this year. Wheat and rye have also risen to their highest prices this year. The Chicago wheat market is extremely enthusiastic. May wheat is selling for one dollar per bushel. The prices of other months have also risen accordingly. Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture today released a drought report stating that areas where agricultural operations are progressing smoothly are now also desperately in need of rain. The areas affected by the disaster are very wide, and various plants that are currently developing have been greatly damaged. People in Washington believe that the situation is serious, and President Hoover may have to cancel his plans to leave Beijing for rest and stay in the capital to deal with the situation.</p>
<h3>Washington, Reuters, 6th</h3>
<p>Railway personnel have reported to President Hoover that they are willing to cooperate in implementing any government plan to relieve the drought.</p>
<h3>Chicago, Associated Press, 6th</h3>
<p>The lack of rain in the midwestern United States means that the drought cannot be avoided. Agricultural leaders are not pessimistic, saying that the problem of overproduction can now be solved by the poor harvest. With reduced production, farmers can get higher prices. At present, the food market has seen great activity due to the drought.</p>

<h3>Military Council Submits Reply, Hamaguchi Refuses to Present</h3>
<p>Kurafuchi Makes Second Request</p>
<p>Ratification of Naval Treaty Likely to be Delayed</p>
<h3>Tokyo, Den Tsushin, 7th</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi met with Kurafuchi, the Speaker of the Privy Council, yesterday afternoon and refused the request to present the response from the Military Council and other information. The Prime Minister's statement can be summarized into four points: (1) The government cannot, in good conscience, request understanding for the Privy Council's request to present the Military Council's response. (2) Questions regarding the intentions of the Navy's leadership should be explained in general by the Minister of the Navy. (3) The specific content of the national defense replenishment plan has not yet reached the stage for explanation due to budget constraints, but it can be clearly stated that all efforts will be made to complete it. (4) Although the memorandum prepared between the Chairman of the Military Council and the Minister of the Navy is not related to the government, the government will never refuse to answer questions when questioning the Minister of the Navy. Given the situation, the Privy Council may give up on the request to present the response, and instead listen to the intentions of the Navy's top leadership, or the Privy Council itself may petition for an imperial audience to present the response. One of these two options must be chosen. Upon receiving this news, the Chief Secretary immediately went to Karuizawa. The scheduled designation of examination committee members on the 5th and 6th will also be postponed, and the treaty review will be suspended for a time. It is most noteworthy what methods Prime Minister Hamaguchi and others will use to promote ratification.</p>
<h3>Tokyo, Den Tsushin, 7th</h3>
<p>Speaker of the Privy Council Kurafuchi visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi at his official residence at 9:00 this morning, hoping to be presented with the government's military force replenishment plan as reference material for the Privy Council's review of the treaty. The Prime Minister replied that he would do his best to facilitate it.</p>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>Reports on the Internal Situation of the Communist Party</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 2:00 p.m. on the 7th. Fu Qixue, the chair, reported that the Changsha incident was the second largest riot by the Communist Party. The public seems to be in a state of panic, but whether the Communist Party can continue to disrupt China is questionable. Reactionaries in the north, such as Wang Jingwei, are paying attention to the Communist Party on the surface, but in reality, they are most eager to use them. The internal situation of the Communist Party has always been very secretive. The Department has recently obtained many secret documents. The Communist Party changes and adapts according to the changes in Soviet Russia. Since the failure of Dostoyevsky, the Chinese Communist Party has also split into two factions. The Stalin faction is led by Li Lisan and Zhou Enlai, and the Dostoyevsky faction is still led by Chen Duxiu. The Communist Party's actions have always been directed by Soviet Russia and Borodin. All revolutionary paths of the Chinese Communist Party are decided by Soviet Russia. Chen Duxiu strongly opposes this method. The reason why the Communist Party is divided into two factions is that the Stalin faction believes that the high tide of the Chinese revolution has arrived, taking the Shanghai people's riot as its objective evidence and Zhu Mao as an example of the peasant revolution. Therefore, they advocate for various activities to broadly implement destruction. Chen Duxiu and others disagree, saying that the Shanghai riot was not done by the people and only sacrificed party members. They should not deceive themselves and should only work hard to organize the working class, and only then will there be a way. As for Zhu Mao, they believe that their actions are thuggish and can only exist because of inconvenient transportation, and they don't pay much attention to them. Once attention is paid, they will certainly not be able to exist. Since the opinions of the two factions are fundamentally different, the Stalin faction expelled Chen from the party, and Chen and 54 others issued a declaration. Those listed include Peng Shuzhi, etc. Since the opinions of the two factions are so conflicting, they attack each other until they are completely wounded. Observing this situation, the past riots in Guangzhou and the current riot in Changsha are actually methods for the Communist Party to dig its own grave, and there will be no room for activity in the future. Once the Communist Party riots, it exposes its sins and gives the people a deeper understanding that it will never achieve anything. Wang Jingwei in Beiping has also expressed considerable views on the Changsha incident, but Wang's contact with the Communist Party is a fact. The Communist Party and Wang have always used all means to win over anyone, which shows the extreme shamelessness. We are all the more heartbroken by Wang's collusion with the Communist Party this time. After the founding of the Republic, Wang was not responsible in our party until the thirteenth year when he went north with the Prime Minister. Although he was responsible in Guangzhou for a year, he was still under Borodin's command. Recently, he has not hesitated to collude with warlords and the Communist Party, which is truly unforgivable. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Hunanese Compatriots in Beijing Petition for the Suppression of Communists</h3>
<p>Saving Hunan is the Same as Saving the Party and the Nation</p>
<p>After the emergency meeting of the Hunanese Compatriots Association in Beijing resolved to request the government to send troops to suppress the communist bandits, they submitted petitions to the Central National Government and the Executive Yuan. The National Government has telegraphed He Yingqin to be responsible for the suppression and has sent Adjutant Peng Xinmin to Wuhan by plane on the morning of the 6th to urge the matter. The document of the Association to the government is recorded as follows: "The Association has been receiving reports from displaced compatriots in Beijing for days, stating that Changsha was captured by the communist bandits under Peng Dehuai on the evening of the 27th. The provincial army was unable to resist and fled in panic. The provincial capital was occupied by the bandits, who burned, killed, and looted day and night. The fires lit up the sky, and the sounds of crying shook the earth. As of the evening of the 30th, all the government offices, schools, public places, and prosperous markets in the city were reduced to ashes. Tens of thousands of people, including Hu Yuantan, the president of Hunan University, Luo Xiankai, the director of the Provincial Militia Bureau, Wang Zhengshi, the magistrate of Changsha County, and Wang Hanchuan, the director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, were brutally killed. Many other gentry and civilians were tied up and extorted, and their lives are uncertain. Furthermore, there has been no news since the 30th, and the devastation must be deepening, the nets must be tightening, and there is no way to escape or die. The Hunanese compatriots in Beijing are all suffering the same pain and have no tears to shed. Therefore, the Association convened a compatriots' meeting on the 4th of this month to discuss rescue measures. According to Zhang Kailian, the provincial secretary who escaped, the Communist Party's plan was seized in Hunan. The Soviet Russian government is using its strength to assist the Chinese Communist Party, directing them to seize the territories of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi as a base for establishing a Soviet. Therefore, the communists from all over have concentrated in Hunan and Jiangxi and are vigorously attacking Changsha and Nanchang, intending to seize Jiangxi and Hunan and then attack Wuhan. The Association's members have combined the communist news obtained before and after and compared it to the current situation. The Soviet Russian government, based on its aggressive ambitions, is doing its best to harm our party and subvert the government, using China as its third international branch. The Changsha incident is a critical juncture and recognizes that saving Changsha at this time is the same as saving Hubei and Jiangxi, and saving Hubei and Jiangxi is the same as consolidating the center, which is the same as saving our party and saving China. Moreover, they cannot bear to see the tragedy of Changsha continue in Nanchang and Wuhan, or even spread to the entire country. Moreover, they cannot bear to see Hunan's demise as a prelude to the demise of Hubei, Jiangxi, and China. Weighing the urgency of the situation, this fiery and all-consuming momentum is even worse than Yan and Feng, and the crisis of national subjugation and racial extinction is pressing. If this is not addressed, there will be no time to address it in the future. After deliberation at the meeting, three key measures were decided: (1) Request the government to send troops to Hunan to suppress the bandits and rescue the people from fire and water. (2) Request that the incompetent and negligent Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, He Jian, be severely punished. (3) Request the government to allocate a large sum of relief funds to relieve the disaster in Hunan. The Association believes that the situation is extremely urgent and brook no delay. In addition to having already elected representatives to petition the government, they have also urgently telegraphed General Commander Chiang of the front lines, Director He of the Wuhan camp, and the Hunanese generals to quickly find ways to provide assistance. The matter is presented to your government departments for review and approval. We implore you to approve the requests and quickly take action to eliminate the red scourge and save the people."</p>

Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, Yin A-yu, a worker from Xiangshan, volunteered to step on the stones by the well and descend to dredge the mud. Unexpectedly, the worker accidentally fell into the bottom of the well. The water was not deep, but he sank deep into the mud and was immediately poisoned and lost consciousness. Yu A-xiang, a shareholder of the shop, entered the well to save Yin and also fell into the water and was poisoned by the well mud.

<p>The Chinese Expeditionary Football Team's Difficulties in Java</p>
<p>One-to-One...Draw with Bandung Players</p>
<p>Yu Hengzhi...Returns to Singapore by Plane to Seek Support</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome in Batavia...Changes in the Competition Schedule in Java, Grand Arrival in Batavia</p>
<p>Various Groups Arrive to Welcome</p>
<p>(Batavia Dispatch, 20th) The Chinese Expeditionary Football Team departed from Singapore on July 18th at 2:00 PM for Java and arrived in Batavia on the morning of the 20th. Members of the Qunli Reception Committee arrived at the pier before dawn while the ship was still offshore to greet them. Reporters from various newspapers, representatives from various organizations, and individuals who came to welcome them also followed suit. At around 6:00 AM, the White Wave ship slowly approached the shore. The Chinese athletes were seen standing on the deck, waving and tipping their hats to the welcomers on the shore. After the ship docked at 6:30, the welcomers boarded the ship and shook hands with each athlete, exchanging greetings. Photographers also came forward to take group photos on the deck. After taking the photos and checking their luggage, they disembarked in an orderly fashion. After disembarking, the photographers took another photo of the Chinese athletes by the ship as a memento. After that, they left the pier, passed through customs, and boarded more than a dozen special cars prepared by the Reception Committee in an orderly fashion, entering the city via Anxu, Raojiang, and Hongqiao, arriving at the Ganjiang Javanese Qunli venue at Manggo Boetal. It was only half past seven when the bell rang, before the scheduled time of the day, resulting in incomplete tea and snack preparations and the absence of the military band. They had no choice but to accompany all the Chinese team members to the opposite Republican Hotel for a temporary rest.</p>
<p>Welcome Reception by the Qunli Association</p>
<p>After the venue was fully arranged and the military band had assembled, a special envoy was sent to invite all the team members to the venue. The military music was magnificent for a time. After the music stopped, everyone took their seats. Yang Hengxiang, chairman of the Qunli Association, gave a speech, first apologizing to the guests, stating that the association had prepared some tea and snacks for the Chinese athletes upon their arrival in Batavia, but due to limited seating, some overseas Chinese were unable to find a seat, for which he apologized and hoped for their understanding. Following that, Hong Junyuan gave a speech in Mandarin, stating that the Lehua team's performance last year had been a great success, and the athletes' artistry was unforgettable. The name Lehua had been deeply imprinted in the minds of people in Nanyang. Today, it was fortunate to see the athletes' artistry again. However, this time, the Lehua team members had joined forces with the elites of Honghua, and their performance was bound to be even better, adding much honor to the overseas Chinese. Afterward, Yu Hengzhi, the leader of the Chinese team, gave a speech of thanks, saying that the Lehua team members were very honored to be reunited with the overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Coming back to their old haunts felt like returning home, and the joy was indescribable. The proposal for several teams to tour Europe was made three years ago and has only now been realized. The team members will definitely work harder to promote the spirit of sports in their country, and the outcome of the matches is not a problem. Later, Mr. Gasten, the representative of the Siqiu Lashi team, gave a speech in English, mostly praising the Lehua athletes and cheering three times. Finally, Mr. Zhong Wensheng, the vice chairman of the Qunli Association, gave a humorous speech in English and then distributed the gold sharp pens presented by the Liu Zhen Company to each player. The tea and snacks were served, and the atmosphere was lively for a time. After the tea and snacks, Yu, the leader of the expedition, led all the team members in cheering three times, and then the meeting was adjourned. Each team member returned to their hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Banquet by the Huaan Company</p>
<p>The Huaan Hequn Insurance Company of the city hosted a banquet at the Datong Restaurant in Banjilan to welcome the Chinese Football Expedition Team. Consul General Zhang and representatives from various overseas Chinese organizations and reporters from various newspapers attended the meeting, totaling sixty to seventy people, a grand occasion indeed.</p>
<p>Guo Tianru Gives a Speech</p>
<p>At a quarter past nine, the banquet began. First, Mr. Guo Tianru, general manager of Huaan Hequn Insurance Company, expressed his welcome. Then, Mr. Yu Hengzhi, the leader of the Chinese team, rose to express his gratitude, saying that when he came here last month to make arrangements, he found it difficult due to unfamiliarity with the people and place. Later, he received great help from Mr. Guo Tianru, who ran errands on his behalf, for which he was privately grateful. He was still unable to repay the favor, and now he was hosting a banquet to entertain him, which made him even more ashamed. He still remembered that when Lehua came to Nanyang last year, Huaan Company was the first to host a banquet to welcome them. This time, Huaan Company was also the first to treat the Chinese team with great kindness, which showed Mr. Guo's enthusiasm and protection for the sports community in China. Consul General Zhang also rose to express his opinions, saying that the Chinese Expedition Team's trip to Nanyang and Europe and the United States represented the sports community in China in its interactions with the world's sports community. Its value was extremely precious, and its significance was the most profound. Moreover, the team members were composed of the elites of the three major forces of Nanhua, Lehua, and Zhonghua, and it was predictable that they would increase the glory of the country. However, he hoped that the members of the Chinese Expedition Football Team would not only interact with the European and American sports communities but should also investigate the social conditions and the political, industrial, educational, and other facilities wherever they went. In particular, they should pay special attention to the national character of the people of each country and conduct detailed observations, as this was the foundation of a nation and was even more important than sports events.</p>
<p>Speeches by Lu Weichang and Others</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Lu Weichang, the representative of the Chinese Circus, was also present. Mr. Lu was originally the founder of the Lehua Football Association and had also been an employee of the Hong Kong Nanhua Association. He expressed his immense joy at the arrival of the team members. Therefore, his words were extremely sincere and heartfelt. A brief description of his speech is as follows: "It is a great honor for me to participate in the grand occasion of the Huaan Hequn Insurance Company hosting a banquet to welcome the Chinese Football Expedition Team tonight. I have been an employee of the Nanhua Sports Association and the Lehua Sports Association, and I have a close relationship with this expedition team. Therefore, my hope that the team members will work hard to bring honor to the country is even more pressing. This expedition team is composed of teams from Nanhua, Lehua, and Zhonghua to form a large Chinese team. This is taking the country as a unit and striving to face the outside world. Therefore, what needs to be paid special attention to at this time is that all the team members should temporarily eliminate their awareness of belonging to Nanhua, Lehua, and Zhonghua and unite as one to become an "indestructible" elite team. Only in this way can they speak of facing the outside world. If, unfortunately, there are still points of misunderstanding among the team members, the will will be inconsistent, and the strength will inevitably be dispersed. How can they overcome the enemy?" Later, Mr. Liu Chengcan, Mr. Li Jifu, Mr. Chen Fuchen, and others all gave passionate speeches. The guests and hosts dispersed in joy at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Changes to the Competition Schedule</p>
<p>The Chinese Expeditionary Football Team is scheduled to have its first match with the Bandung team on the afternoon of the 22nd. On the 23rd, it is said that all the overseas Chinese in Wanlong plan to lead the entire team to visit places of interest. On the 24th, they will compete with the Indonesian League. On the 25th, they will return to Batavia.</p>
<p>The Batavia competition dates</p>
<p>were originally fixed, but there were slight changes on the opponent's side. The opponent originally scheduled for the 26th against the Qunli team has now been changed to the European team of Batavia. The Qunli match has been changed to August 10th. The Siqiu Lashi match has been changed to August 10th.</p>
<p>The dates for the Manchon and Surabaya matches were originally set for the 30th and 1st of August in Manchon and the 3rd and 7th of August in Surabaya. Due to some reasons, they have been slightly moved forward. The Manchon matches have been changed to July 29th and 31st, and the Surabaya matches have been changed to August 2nd and 6th.</p>
<p>In Manchon, the original opponents were the Manchon team on the first day and the Yogyakarta team or the Manchon League on the second day. Now, neither team has been selected, and instead, the Chinese team from Central Java will be used, composed of the elites of the Chinese teams from Manchon, Yogyakarta, and Garangan.</p>
<p>Departure from Batavia to Bandung for Matches</p>
<p>(Bandung Dispatch, 21st) The Chinese Expeditionary Football Team departed from Batavia by train for Bandung at 6:00 AM on the 21st. They will take the field to fight on the 22nd.</p>

<p>First Match in Bandung</p>
<p>One-to-One...Draw with Bandung Players</p>
<p>(Bandung Express, July 22nd) The Chinese Expeditionary Football Team played its first match in Bandung today. The opponent was the Bandung team, and there were nearly 10,000 spectators. The result was a 1-1 draw, which was very disappointing. Details will be reported later.</p>
<p>Seeking Reinforcements by Plane</p>
<p>Yu Hengzhi from Java to Singapore</p>
<p>(Singapore Dispatch, 25th) Due to the strong enemy encountered by the Chinese Expeditionary Football Team in Bandung, in order to consolidate its strength and maintain its reputation, it has specially sent Mr. Yu Hengzhi, the leader of the team, to Singapore by plane to borrow strong players from the Nanhua Football Team. It is said that the three gentlemen he intends to invite are Li Tiansheng, Ye Beihua, and Feng Jingxiang. It is learned that the three gentlemen are originally strong players from Nanhua, and the three gentlemen are also on the team for this expedition to Europe and the United States, but they have not yet joined the team. After arriving in Singapore today (the 25th), Mr. Yu immediately took a fast train to Kuala Lumpur because the Nanhua team was still fighting in northern Malaysia. He contacted the Nanhua team members. If the three gentlemen, Li, Ye, and Feng, had no other commitments, they would take a plane to Java during the day. However, it is still unknown whether they will be able to fulfill their wishes. Further reports will be published later.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau Managed by the Provincial Education Department</p>
<p>Because Guangzhou was changed to a general city.</p>
<p>Because the Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau, Lu Yougang, inquired in a letter in his personal capacity about the powers of the Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau, the Ministry of Education replied in a letter stating that the Executive Yuan had decided in a meeting to follow the city's organizational law and designate it as subordinate to the Guangdong Provincial Government. The powers of the various bureaus in Guangzhou Municipality are naturally different from those of the various bureaus in Shanghai Municipality, which are directly subordinate to the Executive Yuan. In the future, all matters relating to private secondary schools and above in Guangzhou Municipality should be transferred to the Guangdong Provincial Education Department for management. All instructions from the Ministry will also be issued to the Provincial Education Department for notification. The Ministry will no longer directly correspond with your Bureau.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Approves the Establishment of Lingnan and Nantong Schools</p>
<p>Nantong University changed to Nantong College.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved the establishment of Guangzhou Private Lingnan University and Nantong Private Nantong College. In addition to instructing the Guangdong Provincial Education Department to notify the Provincial University, it also instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department: The application for the establishment of Private Nantong University has been inspected by personnel. The university's organization currently has three departments: Agriculture, Medicine, and Textile. However, according to the University Organization Law, there is no Textile College, which does not meet the requirement that a university must have three colleges or more. It should first be approved for establishment under the name "Private Nantong College." After it has three colleges and is submitted to the Ministry for approval, it will be restored to its old name. Please instruct compliance. It is said that the school plans to expand the Textile Department into a College of Engineering after the summer vacation and add related engineering departments.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Guangdong Traders Are Actively Seeking Coarse Yarn</p>
<p>Human Standard Slightly Lifted in Afternoon</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Sales Are Unusually Active, with Guangdong Traders Becoming More and More Diligent. It Is Reported That Several Factories' Coarse Yarn Has Been Exhausted by Their Purchases. It Is Noted That This Group's Purchases Have Been Particularly Smooth Recently, with Most of the Goods Still Stored in Warehouses and Not Yet Shipped Out, While Daily Purchases Continue Uninterrupted, Which Is Quite Perplexing. However, Guangdong Traders Have Always Been Known for Their Strong Financial Resources, and It Is Likely That They Are Preparing for the Peak Sales Season in the Autumn, and This Year's Harvest Is Expected to Be Abundant. However, Most Major Yarn Dealers and Peers in This Port Are Not Interested in Speculating, with Their Minds Being Relatively Calm. The Rise and Fall of the Yarn Market Is Generally Driven by the Smoothness of Actual Demand, and With Such a Large Sales Volume Currently, It Seems Difficult for the Situation to Change in the Short Term. However, It Is Reported That There Are Many Who Are Selling Short in the Forward Market. Recently, Human Standard Prices Have Become More Balanced.</p>
<p>Human Standard prices in the morning market were weaker due to profit-taking, with prices falling by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that there was a strong demand for spot yarn, and the price of third-grade yarn rose, causing increased tension. Prices rose by 0.1 to 0.5 qian in all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,050 bales. Among the sellers, Dafeng sold the most, with 150 bales of first-grade yarn. Maoji, Changji, Tongyu, Zhenda, Taixing, Tianchang, Lichang, Yilong, and Hengchang sold 300 to 650 bales each. Among the buyers, Gongtai bought the most, with 1,000 bales. Tiancheng, Yiyu, Xincheng, Shenchang, Ruida, Qinfeng, Tongxing, and Yichang bought 200 to 950 bales each. The closing prices for Human Standard are listed below, with changes and inventory.</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Prices, Change, Inventory</p>
<p>August: 1695, Down 0.3, 189,50</p>
<p>September: 1594, Down 0.3, 248,00</p>

<p>January: 1394, Unchanged, 4,050</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales remained strong. The total volume of spot and futures yarn purchased by various groups was 3,621 bales. Peers purchased 75 bales. Prices rose by 0.55 to 0.75 qian. Guangdong traders bought the most from the customer groups, totaling 2,160 bales. In addition, Shantou purchased 55 bales, Wuhu purchased 55 bales, Sichuan purchased 425 bales, inland purchased 45 bales, Tianjin purchased 450 bales, Xuzhou purchased 120 bales, Yunnan purchased 211 bales, and miscellaneous groups purchased 100 bales. Factories opened 2,000 bales.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Without Major Changes</p>
<p>The cotton market was relatively stable. Private estimates for American cotton seemed to favor buyers, and most people were optimistic, coupled with good yarn market conditions and uncertain weather. There was a fear of storms, so bullish forces were stronger, and some short sellers were covering their positions, making the market even tighter. However, actual business remained quiet. Japanese factories, which used to make large purchases of futures at this time of year, were quiet because the Indian cotton situation was sufficient. The condition of new cotton production was still quite good.</p>
<p>Tianchang Sold 5,300 Dan of Hankou Standard Cotton</p>
<p>The opening price for Hankou Standard Cotton in the morning market was slightly weak due to an increase in sellers, with prices falling by 0.1 to 0.2 qian. Later, large traders covered their short positions, causing a slight rebound, resulting in a final decrease of only 0.05 qian. In the afternoon, Ruida covered their short positions, causing prices to rise by 0.05 qian in all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 32,800 dan. Among the sellers, Tianchang sold the most, with 5,300 dan. Yuda, Shenda, Xinhua, Yilong, and Qinfeng sold approximately 1,200, 1,500, and 1,400 dan each. Among the buyers, Ruida bought 3,500 dan. Shenxin, Hengyi, Tongxing, Yichang, and Gongtai bought 1,100, 1,300, and 1,900 dan each. The closing prices for Hankou Standard Cotton are listed below.</p>

<p>No Spot Factory Transactions Heard</p>
<p>The spot cotton business was sluggish, and the market maintained its stable state. People were waiting to see the US government's estimate report and the development of the weather. Factories had no intention to trade, with only Guangdong traders buying 400 bales of Yao cotton. There were 824 bales of Yao cotton available. The sales prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Yao Cotton: 34.0 to 34.2, Guangdong Traders Bought 400 Bales</p>
<p>Warehouse Transactions Showed Uniform Rebound in Yarn and Cotton, with American Cotton Initially Weak Then Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to good weather, but then became firm due to short covering and unfavorable forecasts in the west. Futures rose by 12 to 18 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. English cotton futures fell by 5 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by brokers, with Pingguoer rising by 3 rupees, Aomula rising by 2 rupees, Bairoxi rising by 1 rupee, and forward contracts rising by 3 rupees.

<p>Grains, Anhui New Xian Rice Arrives in Shanghai and Sells Well</p>
<p>Anqing Goods Open at 15.5 Yuan…Jing Rice Raises, Second to Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday, only five or six boats arrived from various groups. Sales were high, and second-grade Bei Jing rice, if high-quality, opened at 21 yuan. Mid-grade prices rose slightly, but top-grade goods inevitably rose beyond the limit. The Jing rice market as a whole showed a trend of rising prices for second-grade goods. Due to the lack of demand, second-grade goods fell in price, and no one was interested. Dongxin Jing still opened at 21 yuan, but the overall trend had softened, so the market today and tomorrow may experience small fluctuations.</p>
<p>There was little inventory of thin rice, and sales were slow. The market lacked accurate estimates. New customer Xian rice had arrived in Shanghai, with goods from Anqing and other places opening at 15.5 yuan, totaling over 100 shi. At this price, shippers could still make a profit. Transactions became tight, and the market rose another 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Hu Nan</p>
<p>There were few sources of river goods, and sales on the street were sluggish. Changbang machine Jing rice prices were high, and second-grade prices were cut. Su Tong machine Jing rice prices could not rise due to continued factory goods. Therefore, only high-quality Jing rice prices rose. The middle and lower grades were consistent. Dongxin Jing was the same as the Zhabei market. There was a shortage of thin rice and Yangjian rice in this area. The large Wei rice price was depressed, and Baiyuan sales remained active. Domestic goods declared higher prices to Shanghai, so the Shanghai market unanimously rose. The top price here reached 18.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Sales Were Sluggish and Continued to Fall</p>
<p>Tianjin Shipping Was Again Banned</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was very sluggish. Local sales totaled over 1,000 bags. There was no demand from the North, the Yangtze River, or the provinces of Zhejiang. The price fell by about 3 jiao. The overall market only opened with 1,000 small jiao bags at 14.7 yuan to 14.8 yuan, 200 Saigon bags at 16.8 yuan to 16.5 yuan, and 200 small jiao rough bags at 11.4 yuan. 500 large jiao bags were opened and then returned, with a price of 12.5 yuan to 12.1 yuan. Tianjin and other northern ports were banned for three days, with less than 10,000 bags loaded and less than 5,000 bags newly traded. Yesterday, a northern gang reported that loading had suddenly been banned for the second time. Tianjin and other ports had already independently decided to dispose of foreign rice. The sluggishness was not greatly affected by the ban, but the frequent changes in government orders caused merchants to complain.</p>
<p>Flour Market Plunged in Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices rose uniformly for all months. August and September rose as high as 2 liang 5 qian 4 fen, and December and January rose to 2 liang 5 qian 5 fen. People were generally stable because it was rumored that the northern transport of flour had been understood by the Ministry of Finance and Customs, and it was said that the tax-reporting quota was set at 1 million. Therefore, many speculators were shaken and rushed to cover their positions, making the market better than the previous day. In the afternoon, the market proved that the rumors were baseless, and many speculators sold flour. News also came from the Tianjin gang that Japanese flour was scheduled to arrive, causing the market to collapse. The closing price for the current month was only 2 liang 5 qian 1 fen 25, a decrease of 2.5 fen from the previous day. The next month was down 1.25 fen, October was down 0.075 fen, November was down 0.05 fen, and December and January were up 0.075 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Rose and Fell Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the wheat market opened in the morning, factories' appetite for spot wheat was very strong, with spot wheat still opening at 5 liang. There was little spot wheat arriving, and sales were active. Buyers' interest in futures wheat was also strong, so prices rose by several fen when they opened. Later, after foreign wheat was reported to rise and then fall, and flour sales weakened, prices fell back uniformly in all months. The closing price for the current month was down 0.029, October was down 0.05, November was down 0.04, and December was down 0.01. January was unchanged. There was little spot wheat arriving, and factories' appetite remained strong. The overall market opened with 5,800 bags, with Gao Che wheat at 5.4 liang 9 qian 5 fen, and mid-grade at 4.78 qian to 5.6 qian, purchased by Fuxin and others.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea, Italian Silk Prices Rose in New York</p>
<p>As the weather in New York gradually cooled, silk weaving factories were steadily increasing orders and opening production lines. The economy was showing signs of stability. Sales of raw silk were gradually rising, and silk prices were rising. Italian special grade silk opened at $5.45 per pound on Tuesday, special grade at $5.12, and top grade at $4.8 (USD), an increase of approximately $0.10.</p>
<p>Factory Sales Were Gradually Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai gradually became firmer. New York factory reports showed continued transfers to Shanghai. Unfortunately, the opening prices did not rise much. Only Qianli and others transferred 70 bales of Shanghai white silk, and Dachang and others transferred 50 bales of Huang silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<p>Road Traders, Zhenmei French Sales Slightly Moved</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai tea market saw slight activity in Zhenmei green tea from Lulai Road traders to French traders. British merchants Jinlong, Tongfu, Xiehe, Yongxing, and other firms all began to purchase core tea, with top-grade opening at 235 taels. However, the selling price of ordinary goods remained low. Yesterday, several large Wuyuan traders continued to open sales, with prices ranging from 46.5 to 56 taels, a decrease of 3 taels from the previous day. Other goods such as Zhenmei and Gongxi remained unchanged. British and Russian traders made no purchases of Qining black tea yesterday, and the market remained sluggish.</p>
<p>Hardware, Large Bar Lead Market Prices Fell Back</p>
<p>The price of large bar blue lead in the market recently saw a shortage of sources from Xiang lead, and there was hope for a rise. However, sales were scarce, and the incoming prices were frequently loose. Therefore, people were terrified, and the market price fell back. It currently sells for 15.5 taels, a decrease of 0.03 taels compared to the previous day. However, actual transactions by buyers were still scarce, and the market felt very idle. It was heard that the inventory of colored products such as Indian lead had recently become very depleted, so the standard was slightly firmer than other colors, selling for 16 taels. Transactions, such as those from northern traders, were still frequent.</p>
<p>English Tinplate Has No New Arrivals in Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding ninety-pound English tinplate, yesterday, foreign firms reported that the factory had recently produced little and owed many futures contracts to various parties. Therefore, it was feared that there would be no spot goods arriving in Shanghai within the next one or two months. Upon receiving this news, local traders were all firm and raised their standards, so each box had to be sold for 14.5 taels. In recent days, traders from Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and other places have purchased large quantities, causing most of the spot goods in the circulation market to be purchased. Investigations showed that over 1,300 to 1,400 boxes had been shipped out, and many people continued to purchase them. A survey of the entire market showed that there were only 400 to 500 boxes left, which was not enough to meet the needs of several customers, so the market situation was likely to rise again. There was also little initial supply of one-hundred-pound goods, and the price was also estimated at 15.5 taels.</p>
<p>North-South Goods, New Dried Longan Meat Is Scarce and Prices Are High</p>
<p>A few pieces of new dried longan meat arrived at the Guangdong traders the day before, and the color was still bright red. Because the quantity was limited and it was the first time new goods had been seen, the opening price was very good, exceeding the price of old goods by 15 to 16 taels. If more goods arrived in the future, the price would likely fall. Ordinary old dried longan meat opened at around 29 taels, and the market situation was normal.</p>

<h3>A Detective Was Assassinated on Rue du Lieutenant Petiot Last Night</h3>
<p>Rue du Lieutenant Petiot has a lot of bloodstains.</p>
<p>The deceased's cash was untouched.</p>
<p>The body was discovered by French soldiers.</p>
<p>Speculation on the cause of the assassination.</p>
<p>Last night, at around 8 p.m., an assassination occurred at the entrance of a building numbered 40 at the intersection of Rue du Lieutenant Petiot and Rue Pichon in the French Concession. The deceased was an investigator from the Sixth District, 23rd Squad of the River Police. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Discovery by French Soldiers</p>
<p>At around 8 p.m. last night, four French soldiers were patrolling near the intersection of Rue du Lieutenant Petiot and Rue Pichon and discovered the body of a man who had been shot with a handgun in front of number 40. The corpse was approximately 27 or 28 years old, dressed in a white silk long gown with a large floral pattern, short homespun trousers, floral socks, black satin shoes, and a flat-topped white straw hat. At that moment, a car passed by, and the four French soldiers loaded the body into the car and sent it to the Baojian Road Police Station.</p>
<p>Symbols and Photos</p>
<p>Subsequently, the police chief examined the corpse and discovered four gunshot wounds: one in the right forehead, one in the right waist, and one each in the right leg and left foot. Inside his small shirt pocket, they found a piece of paper with the words "Jiangsu River Police, Sixth District, 23rd Squad Investigator, Ye Miaoji." There was also a photo that matched the deceased's appearance, fifty dollars in cash, ten small coins, a gold watch, and a cigarette holder. Nothing else was found. After the examination, the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>Speculation on the Cause</p>
<p>Last night, a reporter from this newspaper went to the scene to investigate. Rue du Lieutenant Petiot is extremely desolate, with very few pedestrians after 8 p.m. There were many bloodstains on the ground in front of number 40. The building across the street is the residence of a foreign customs officer. According to the gatekeeper, at around 8 p.m., he suddenly heard several loud bangs, which he recognized as gunshots. Because he had no weapons, he did not dare to go out and only closed the iron gate. He knew nothing else. People in the police station speculated that it might be related to the case a few days ago where the chief detective of the Sixth District of the River Police broke up a bandit den in Zhabei and rescued a kidnap victim. The kidnappers held a grudge and committed this act.</p>
<p>Mei Fei and Hu Yongquan Jointly Accused of Criminal Charges</p>
<p>Tan Meiying Mourns Her Husband's Indulgence</p>
<p>Fearing the Family Fortune Would Be Squandered</p>
<p>Sues for Encroachment of a Single Automobile</p>
<p>Neither Defendant Appeared Yesterday</p>
<p>Mei Fei (real name Chen Junxia), a prostitute from a singing house, and Hu Yongquan have recently been sued in the Special District Court by Ms. Tan Meiying through lawyers Lu Qi and Zhao Zuwei on criminal charges of encroachment of a single automobile, forced signing of documents, forgery of private seals, and conspiracy to defraud. Ms. Tan only married Zhao Guangzu, a wealthy young man from Baoshan, on January 18 of this year and lives with him at 139 Route Cardinal Mercier. Zhao is only 23 years old.</p>
<p>It is said that frequent visitors always frequent Pipa Lane. According to Ms. Tan's lawsuit, Gu Jingan led Zhao Guangzu to Mei Fei's place last summer, where he was seduced by Mei Fei and not allowed to return home day and night. At that time, Mei Fei posted a notice at Le Yu Li, Guangxi Road, and then rented a small house at 41 Yong'an Li, Ningbo Road. In less than half a year, Guangzu spent over ten thousand dollars at Mei Fei's place and was introduced by Mei Fei to Hu Yongquan, who was known in the brothels as a "pillar." From then on, the three of them went in and out together without any sense of shame. By the end of the year, relatives were concerned that Guangzu, who had lost his parents early and was young, was easily led astray. They strongly advocated marrying the plaintiff in January of this year, hoping that she could persuade him from the sidelines or that he might repent. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the wedding, he was summoned by Mei Fei, and the small house was moved overnight to 243 Yulin Li, Guling Road. Then, at the end of May of this year, Mei Fei suddenly encouraged Guangzu to buy a new car,</p>
<p>claiming that Hu Yongquan's old carriage could be sold and a new one bought in a few days. She persuaded him to offer 2,400 taels, with the old car valued at 400 taels. He paid 1,000 taels in cash on the spot, and the remaining amount was agreed to be paid later. Hu Yongquan signed the contract. Unexpectedly, the defendant claimed the next day that the money could not be delayed and had to be found quickly. The next day, she instigated Guangzu to return home and secretly take out four property deeds from the ancestral home at 93 Que Lane, Jiangwan Road,</p>
<p>totaling over 21 mu, as well as a deed for a property on Baoding Road and an insurance policy, and hand them over to Hu Yongquan to mortgage. Hu wrote a receipt, and Mei Fei asked Guangzu to give her 2,000 yuan for pocket money after the mortgage was obtained, and a written agreement was also made. After the plaintiff discovered the situation, she rushed to negotiate, but the defendant insisted that because the car price was not available, she was preparing to mortgage it.</p>
<p>The plaintiff argued that the property could not be disposed of by the defendant alone and that there was no need to mortgage it, and insisted on returning it. However, Yongquan claimed that the car had already been mortgaged to the Unified Bank and would be detained unless the price was paid to redeem it. The plaintiff had no choice but to borrow 2,000 taels from Yitai Bank and paid 1,600 taels to redeem the car, plus over 100 taels in interest. The defendants then handed over all the title deeds of the property on Baoding Road. As for the four deeds of Jiangwan Road, Hu Yongquan said that they had been mortgaged elsewhere. The plaintiff was shocked and repeatedly negotiated severely.</p>
<p>Hu initially promised to redeem them in three to five days, and then promised to find a way to redeem the original deeds within half a month. When the deadline arrived, he ignored the reminders. She then entrusted lawyer Ye Fukan to send a letter of demand. Hu suddenly entrusted lawyer Liu Zuwang to falsely claim that the property deeds had been mortgaged by Guangzu through him, and that they were stamped with Guangzu's seal. Guangzu usually used a copper monkey-shaped seal made by the Printing Bureau,</p>
<p>but he had been spending lavishly recently, and the plaintiff had been collecting and keeping it safe. It had never been used outside. How could there be a stamped mortgage? It is clear that the defendants forged private seals and conspired to defraud. It should be known that mortgage procedures should have a clear record. How can they fabricate facts out of thin air? Once interrogated, the truth will surely come to light. Now, the defendants not only conspired to defraud and treated the property deeds as their own, but also dared to forge private seals, fabricate mortgage documents, design a conspiracy to defraud, and dare to pass off fakes as genuine, openly claiming creditors' rights.</p>
<p>Guangzu was surrounded by Mei Fei's charms, indulging in pleasure all day long, his mind was confused, and his judgment was completely lost. Therefore, he was trapped in a heavy siege and did not realize he was being harmed to this extent. The inheritance on which the plaintiff's family relied for livelihood had been halved in just one year, and she even asked the plaintiff for a divorce</p>
<p>in order to achieve her cunning scheme to destroy the family. It should be requested to summon the case and punish them separately. As for all the encroached Jiangwan Road property deeds and a car, it is also requested to issue a private suit to order the return of all forced documents and forged private seal contracts to be revoked, etc. The case was opened yesterday morning. The defendants Mei Fei and Hu Yongquan were both absent. According to their lawyers, Hu had gone to Hankou to request a postponement, while Mei Fei's lawyer presented a doctor's certificate stating that Mei Fei was ill.</p>
<p>However, Judge Sun ruled that since the plaintiff had arrived, the trial should begin immediately. The plaintiff's lawyer briefly stated the case, and then the plaintiff Tan Meiying testified that she was 22 years old and from Suzhou. The following was similar to the indictment. At the end, she said that one day she went to room 309 of the Great China Hotel to find her husband, but she did not find him. She accidentally opened the drawer of the desk in the room and found a paper package containing a woman's photo,</p>
<p>a business card, and sentences on it suggesting that he wanted a divorce from her. She was very shocked that the person she depended on was prostituting himself outside and she had never interfered, but he wanted a divorce from her. She had no choice but to file a lawsuit. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the plaintiff initially asked Hu to return the property deed through lawyer Jiang Baoli. Lawyer Jiang was also invited to testify.</p>
<p>Then Zhao Guangzu was interrogated. Zhao's testimony about his relationship with Mei Fei, his acquaintance with Hu through the prostitute, and the purchase of the car and mortgage of the property deeds were all the same as the original indictment. However, he said that the property was all inherited from his ancestors and was managed by him. After he married his wife, relatives claimed that he was wasting money and advocated that the management rights be handed over to his wife. Because he still had a 17-year-old younger brother, the property was not his alone. Mei Fei insisted on marrying him before buying the car</p>
<p>and wanted to obtain part of the family property management rights. Therefore, he took out the property deed and handed it over to her, which led to it being mortgaged by the two of them. Then lawyer Jiang testified about the process of being entrusted by Zhao Guangzu to ask Hu for the property deed, saying that he had invited Hu to meet and talk. Hu admitted that he had four property deeds, but said that the land was not worth much and that he had previously mortgaged one property deed for 1,700 yuan on behalf of Zhao. If Zhao wanted to redeem the three property deeds of Jiangwan Road, then the previously mortgaged one should also be redeemed. This was the situation at the time of the conversation.</p>
<p>He didn't know anything else. The plaintiff added that after discovering that all the property deeds had been taken away by her husband, she planned to sue the police station. Her husband did not want her to and handed over another property deed for her to manage. Judge Sun interrogated to this point and ordered a postponement of fourteen days, instructing the defendant to bring the property deed to the case for further questioning.</p>
<p>The You Family Lawsuit</p>
<p>Dispute Over Family Property for Inheritance</p>
<p>You Jiang, a woman from Wuxi, recently hired lawyer Qian Shusheng to file a self-complaint in the criminal court of the local court against You Lianceng, You Rong, You Tingkun, Xia Guangwen, Yu Tao, etc. for jointly forcing others to perform non-obligatory acts and injury, requesting a thorough investigation, etc. The complaint stated that Ms. You (the first plaintiff) is the mother of You Guilin and You Maolin. You Xinbai, the brother of Ms. You's husband, died without children in 1924. All the family property was temporarily managed by his adopted son, Lianceng. In July of this year, Gao, Xinbai's wife, and the clan chief You Yisheng, etc., chose Ms. You's son Guilin as Xinbai's adopted son and drew up a will, notifying Lianceng to hand over the family property. However, after receiving the notice, Lianceng first hired lawyer Shen Jian to mediate. Because the conditions could not be agreed upon, on the afternoon of July 28 of this year, after 8 p.m., he first took his wife Le and son Tingkun to Maolin's house and used deceitful means to take Maolin and Ms. You into a car. Then, at the intersection of Chongqing Road, he went to the house of Han Arong, a porcelain shop owner, and took Guilin into the car. They drove to the Dafugui Restaurant in the city for dinner. After dinner, Lianceng firmly agreed that the three of Ms. You's family would go to his house, saying that family affairs could be discussed together. Ms. You, etc., did not guard against his treachery and went together. When they arrived, they saw the clan chief You Yisheng, lawyer Shen Jian, and Wang Linfu, Yu Tao, etc. already there. After Ms. You, etc., arrived, Lianceng invited his nephew You Xichang over. Lianceng instructed Yu Tao to draft a document, the content of which was roughly to cancel the inheritance document held by Guilin and firmly order everyone present to sign, otherwise they would not be allowed to leave. Therefore, Yisheng and Jinchang all signed. Ms. You's family was not invited. Xia Guangwen, a shop assistant from Lianceng's shop, held the document and forced Guilin to sign it many times, but he never agreed. Then Maolin made an excuse to urinate and escaped first. It was already 2:30 a.m. Guilin managed to escape at 3 a.m. It was already the second half of the night. Only Ms. You was left in his house, suffering his many pressures. Helpless, Ms. You thought that since her sons had not signed, even if only she signed, and it was under duress, it might not be effective. Ms. You, being old and weak, signed reluctantly in order to escape the danger. In this way, they treated the law as a joke and seized the inheritance. Guilin, who was eager to escape at the time, was dragged and injured his wrist, causing the skin to break and swell. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit, requesting an examination of the injuries, summoning witnesses, and a judgment according to law. The defendants You Lianceng, etc., also hired lawyers Ye Fukan and Shen Jian to submit a reply. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Judge Qian Chengjun specially opened the Fifth Court to hear the case. First, You Lianceng, 52 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 4 Youche Street, oil bean industry, testified. You Rong, 51 years old, from Wuxi (Lianceng's wife), residing at the same address, Xia Guangwen, 30 years old, from Nantong, oil bean industry, testified.

(Question) Who is You Yisheng? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Who is the clan chief? (Answer) There isn't one, because they (referring to Xinbai's wife) wanted my son to be his son. (Question) Which son did they want? (Answer) Guilin to be his son. (Question) What is Xinbai's wife's maiden name? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) When did this happen? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) This is not allowed. You can't just casually and muddledly file a lawsuit. According to you, do others know that your son was adopted? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Who knows? (Answer) I don't remember. (Question) Why are you fighting a lawsuit? (Answer) I don't know. The judge said, "You are too confused!" (Question) Have you ever ridden in a car? (Answer) Yes, my nephew invited me to talk about family affairs. (Question) What family affairs? (Answer) Just this document. (Question) What is this matter? (Answer) They asked me to sign something. At that time, my two sons had already left. (Question) Were you willing to sign? (Answer) What's not to be willing to? (Question) If you were willing, there would be no need to file a lawsuit.

(Question) After You Xinbai died, did you ever wear mourning clothes? (Answer) I never wore mourning clothes. Now, because You Gao is old and doesn't get along with Lianceng, the current inheritance document was drawn up for me to sign because my aunt (You Gao) asked me to be her son, and the clan chief signed it. Afterwards, Lianceng asked me to publish a statement in the newspaper denying that I was Xinbai's son. (Question) Why are you suing them? You should explain separately. (Answer) I am suing Yu Tao because he drafted the document, and I am suing Xia Guangwen because he forced me to sign it. They said that our family would recommend me to a good business.

My brother and I did not sign, only my mother signed, etc. The official asked again, "Why are You Lianceng and Tingkun not here today?" (Answer) Tingkun has gone to Jiujiang for trade, so he is not here. The official said, "The next time the court is in session, they must be ordered to appear." Again, (Question) Who is Yu Tao?

You Gao is my concubine mother. As for the signing, etc., I know nothing about it, etc. You Rong also testified that on the third day of the intercalary month of this year, Guilin's family came and said they would not agree to be You Gao's adopted son. (Question) Did you drag Guilin's arm and injure it? (Answer) No, the injury on his arm, according to Guilin himself, was that he was burned by charcoal fire while smoking in Yanzi Nest, etc. Xia Guangwen testified that after lawyer Yu wrote the draft, he gave it to Guilin to look at and said it was correct.

<p>A Woman's Head Was Split by an Axe</p>
<p>No One Knows Who Her Husband Is</p>
<p>Yang Mingfang Committed the Murder to Vent His Anger</p>
<p>At about 6 a.m. yesterday, at the end of Changan Road, Zhabei, in front of the Yutong Road Baolun</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>Silk Factory, just as female workers were entering the factory one after another, a strong, burly man with a dark complexion, carrying a sharp axe in his hand, pushed his way through the crowd. When he approached a woman, he suddenly raised the axe and struck the woman three times, hitting the left side of her eye, neck, etc., penetrating deeply, about an inch into the flesh and bone. Blood gushed out like a spring, and she fell to the ground on the spot, barely breathing. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the murderer turned to flee, but the 11th patrol guard of the 2nd branch of the 4th district had already heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, immediately arresting the murderer and taking him to the police station. After a while, a man claiming to be the injured woman's husband also turned himself in, asking for an investigation. Director Li questioned the man who turned himself in, who gave his name as Cao Zicai, from Funing, 33 years old, living on a boat at Chadaijiao. The injured woman, Zhu, is 30 years old and is now my wife. The murderer is her former husband. About four months ago, Zhu met me, and we were attracted to each other and willing to spend our lives together. Since my house was lacking a wife, we lived together. However, suddenly a person (the murderer) came forward to negotiate with me, saying that Zhu was his legal wife and he had to take her back to her hometown. However, she firmly refused to go, so we filed a lawsuit in court. I was ordered to pay 150 yuan to formally marry Zhu as my wife and separate from her former husband (the murderer). A divorce certificate was on file. Unexpectedly, a month later, this morning, Zhu was on her way to work at the factory when she was suddenly hacked and her life was in danger. Judging from the circumstances, it is a case of marital jealousy. I request a strict investigation, etc., and presented the divorce certificate for inspection. The murderer confessed that his name was Yang Mingfang, from Funing, 42 years old. Zhu is indeed my concubine. Her husband is still registered in her hometown. Last year, she disliked her husband's poverty and began an affair with me. Later, her husband found out, and this spring she secretly came to Shanghai with me, swearing that she wanted to be with me forever. How could she abandon the old and welcome the new, and have an affair with Cao? We once filed a lawsuit, and the judgment was for each to reconcile. However, Cao forged a divorce certificate, pretending to borrow money and asking me to sign as a witness. I am illiterate and fell for his trick. Now they are living together, like a loving couple. I am unwilling, so I grabbed an axe and killed her to vent my anger. Director Li reviewed the confession and said that the case was complicated. It was unclear who Ms. Li was the wife of. After investigation, the truth would surely come to light. He ordered that Cao and Zhang be sent to the police station for interrogation first. It is said that Ms. Li is currently being treated at Baolong Hospital. Because the injuries are all in vital areas, it is feared that she will not survive.</p>
<p>This Newspaper Is Found Not Guilty in Lawsuit</p>

The defendants were summoned to continue the hearing, and the lawyers for the defendants and the lawyer for the Industrial Bureau debated. At the end, Judge Xu immediately declared that this newspaper was found not guilty and declared innocent. The case against Shanghai Bao was postponed to next Tuesday for sentencing. Yu Dexiong of Waijing Bao and Zhang Yumen of Robin Hood Bao were each fined 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Another Large Real Estate Transaction</p>
<p>Sofa Trading Company Sells to a Chinese Capital Group</p>
<p>Damei Evening News reported that another large real estate transaction was completed in Shanghai on Tuesday afternoon. The location was at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Tenant de la Tour, totaling 63 mu of land. It was sold by Sofa Trading Company to a capital group composed of four Chinese for a total price of 1,354,500 taels, valued at 21,500 taels per mu. It was said that someone had been willing to buy it for 21,000 taels per mu a few days ago, but the deal did not go through. This time, the price increased by another 500 taels, which can be said to be a good price. The purchaser paid the deposit that day. It is said that the formal handover will take place soon. It is reported that the land is part of the New Kang property, totaling over 100 mu. Most of it was sold this time, and the remainder is still managed by the Sofa brothers. It is not yet known what the Chinese capital group plans to do with the purchased land. It is expected to be used for building houses, as the location is excellent for building Western-style apartments and houses.</p>
<p>American Tourist Group Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>American Community Scheduled to Host Banquet Tonight</p>

Many American residents came to welcome them. The members of the group disembarked one after another and exchanged brief greetings with the greeters. Then they boarded more than 20 cars and went to the designated location to rest. The American community is also scheduled to hold a grand welcome party tonight at 8 p.m. to entertain the entire group. Starting tomorrow, they will visit various scenic spots in Shanghai. On the 10th, they will go to Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places to travel.

<p>Ticket Sales All Day at Major Beijing-Shanghai Railway Stations</p>
<p>One Hour Earlier at Smaller Stations</p>
<p>Since the Beijing-Shanghai Railway administration was thoroughly reorganized by the Ministry of Railways, business has become more prosperous. Third and fourth-class carriages have also been improved and refurbished. Each carriage has also reduced the number of seats by 20, so it feels more spacious. Passengers all praised the convenience. However, the ticket sales time at major stations along the route began only 20 minutes before the train arrived, which caused general passengers to rush and crowd, especially women and the elderly who felt the most inconvenience. In order to eliminate this pain for passengers, the Ministry of Railways yesterday instructed the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administrations to change the ticket sales at major stations along the line, such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and Shanghai South Station, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Zhakou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, to all-day ticket sales. The remaining smaller stations will all start selling tickets one hour earlier. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administrations have ordered all stationmasters along the line to comply with the Ministry's orders.</p>
<p>New Auxiliary Ferries Added to Wusong River Ferry Crossings</p>
<p>Since the 12 Wusong River ferry crossings were thoroughly reorganized by the Municipal Public Works Bureau last year, all new ferries have been built and put into operation according to the prescribed style, making them safe and comfortable for travelers. Later, due to the crowding of passengers every morning and evening, one boat was not enough to transport them. The bureau temporarily allowed the old boats to be renovated and added to the service, but ordered new auxiliary ferries to be built and completed by the end of July of this year. Now that the deadline has expired, the ones that have been built and passed the bureau's inspection and been issued licenses are Hanzhong Road, Tongji Road, Guangzhao Road, Maigen Road, Tanzawan West Ferry, Panjiawan West Ferry, Xiaoshadu, and other seven locations. The remaining Yongyu East Ferry, Tanzawan East Ferry, Tanjia Ferry, Changan Road, Meiyuan Road, and other five locations were delayed by the shipyard and could not be completed as scheduled. It is said that the bureau, in consideration of the difficulties of the merchants, has reset the deadline and ordered them to be completed and reported for inspection by August 10. Failure to meet the deadline will result in punishment without leniency.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department Recruits Inspectors and Probationary Inspectors</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette, since the publication of Notice No. 3953, the Bureau has received a total of more than 1,200 application letters.

<p>The Second Bus Route in Zhabei Has Slightly Changed</p>
<p>The Fare Has Also Been Set</p>
<p>The second route of the Chinese-owned bus company, which originally ran from North Sichuan Road to Hengfeng Bridge, has been in operation for two years, but the number of passengers is still small. The company submitted a request to the authorities to change the route the year before last, but it was not approved because the route runs across Zhabei and is important from a transportation perspective. However, the company believes that its capital is at stake and its business has not improved, so it has submitted another request to slightly change the route. It has now been approved and will be implemented by the end of this month, changing from North Sichuan Road to Jingjiang Road, then turning to Gonghe Xinza, heading north into Zhongxing Road, the Shanghai-Tai Long-distance Bus Company, then out of Datong Road to Xinzha Bridge. The fare is as follows: Xinzha Bridge to Gonghe Xin Road, 8 cents; Shanghai-Tai Station, 11 cents; Qiujiang Road, 14 cents; Song Park Road, 17 cents; Entrance of the Fifth District Second Police Station, 20 cents; North Sichuan Road, 23 cents.</p>

<h3>Zhu Mao's Intrusion into Northern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Central Government Has Dispatched a Large Army to Jiujiang to Defend and Suppress the Bandits</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province Has Also Dispatched Troops to Join in Suppressing the Bandits in Eastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that the communist bandits Zhu Mao this time mobilized their entire forces to invade eastward, occupying Gao'an and attempting to invade Nanchang. However, due to the Eighteenth Division's tight defense, they found no opportunity and have already fled northwest from Fengxin. Yesterday, Zhang Huizan reported at the Provincial Party Headquarters' memorial week that "When the communist bandits advanced from Gao'an to Shengmi this time, Zhu Mao convened a military conference of the bandit troops at the Wanshou Palace in Xishan (sixty li from the province), deciding to divide their forces and attack Nanchang directly. Later, Zhu De personally went to the forefront, the Changtouleng area, to survey the terrain. Seeing that our fortifications were solid and the deployments were meticulous, leaving no opening, he changed his strategy and fled to northern Jiangxi, hoping to disrupt the Nanxun Railway and invade Jiujiang. However, Jiujiang's military strength is substantial, so the communist bandits' plan is just a pipe dream." According to military sources, the communist bandits who previously occupied Luojiashan are now retreating from Gao'an towards Fengxin and Jing'an. There are no traces of bandits east of Xishan. The main forces are fleeing northwest towards the Nanxun Railway. Lu Diping, considering northern Jiangxi as the gateway to Jiangxi, has ordered the Twelfth Brigade to proceed to De'an and Tujiapu on the Nanxun Railway yesterday to protect the safety of traffic on the line. Regarding the Jiujiang area, in addition to Deng Shuren's and Guo Rutong's units, the Central Government has recently dispatched the Third Teaching Division's Wen Brigade to Xun to be stationed there. This brigade, consisting of three regiments, arrived in Xun on the 3rd of this month and will soon coordinate with Deng's and Guo's units, as well as the Nanxun Railway and provincial troops, to encircle and suppress the bandits. Furthermore, in eastern Jiangxi, the communist bandit Fang Zhimin recently captured Shangrao, Dexing, Wannian, and other counties for the second time, devastating them. The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that eastern Jiangxi borders Zhejiang, has decided to dispatch troops to assist in the suppression. In addition to dispatching a regiment to station in Hekou, it plans to dispatch a large force through Changshan and Yushan to station in the Shangrao area to cooperate with the Jiangxi army in suppressing the bandits.

<h3>Japanese Warships Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Osaka reports that since the communist bandit disturbances in Changsha, Japanese residents in various ports along the Yangtze River have been sending telegrams to their government, requesting that it take this opportunity to increase the strength of the Japanese navy along the river and demanding that marines be sent to Hunan to protect Japanese residents. After deliberation, the Japanese government first transferred 200 marines from Shanghai to land in Changsha and immediately ordered the four destroyers, "Momo," "Yanagi," "Hinoki," and "Kashi," stationed in the Sasebo naval port, to set sail, carrying a large number of marines who will disembark in Hankou. The number of Japanese warships along the Yangtze River has recently suddenly increased to as many as sixteen, all under the command of Commander Yonei. The deployment locations of the warships have recently been announced by the Japanese Navy Ministry as follows:</p>

<h3>Yan Xishan's Headquarters Moves to Ji'nan</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Ji'nan reports that Yan Xishan's special train arrived at Ji'nan station at 9:30 this morning (the 2nd), departing from Yancheng at 8:30 am. The train consisted of locomotive number 303, five blue steel cars, two third-class cars, and eighteen boxcars, flatcars, and gondola cars for the guard battalion, which was equipped with three automobiles. Only after the train stopped was it learned that Yan was not on the train. Only Yang Hou, the deputy director of the General Headquarters' Staff Office, led personnel from various departments of the General Headquarters to Ji'nan. Chief of Staff Gu Renfa came to Ji'nan the night before and did not travel on the train. After the train arrived, he immediately went to the train to conduct business. When this reporter sought an interview, Senior Staff Officer Shen Mingge acted as the representative. According to him, Yan had already left Yancheng by special train northward at 4:00 pm on the 1st. Personnel from various departments of the headquarters have been ordered to move to Ji'nan. Yancheng is now empty. After Yan's departure northward, it is uncertain whether he will come south to Ji'nan or remain stationed in Yancheng. Military affairs on the southern front remain in a stalemate in Nanyi with little change. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Reorganizes Fujian Politics</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou reports that Yang Shuzhuang's mission in returning to Fujian this time is to strengthen the provincial government and resolve the two issues concerning Lu Xingbang. The Finance, Education, and Construction Departments under the provincial government have all had committee members appointed as acting heads. However, the position of the Director of the Civil Affairs Department and the Secretary-General of the provincial government are still vacant. Therefore, a few days ago, Chen Peikun was urged again to immediately assume the position of acting Director of the Civil Affairs Department in accordance with the decision of the National Government and to recommend Chen Zuwang, the secretary of the Navy Department who accompanied him back to Fujian this time, to act as the Secretary-General of the provincial government. This will likely be realized within a few days. Since returning to Fujian, Yang himself has been staying in the provincial government, reviewing documents and clearing accumulated cases, which is a stark contrast to his previous leisurely attitude in the province, spending time between Mawei and Gushan. Yang is now planning to abolish redundant agencies, such as the Budget Committee and various consumption tax bureaus, requiring them to close by the end of July. He also plans to eliminate redundant personnel to reduce expenditures and reorganize taxes to increase revenue. The first step is to start with the salt tax, deciding to abolish the official monopoly system and switch to a merchant-based system, allowing merchants to directly go to the salt fields to buy salt. Government offices will collect taxes at the fields, and then merchants will be free to transport and sell the salt in various places. According to this method, the monthly salt tax revenue can be doubled to about 1.5 million yuan (currently only over 700,000 yuan is collected). A few days ago, he convened a meeting at the provincial government with provincial government members Chen Peikun, Finance Special Commissioner He Gonggan, Salt Transport Envoy Shen Jinmian, Salt Bureau Secretary Chen Erlv, and Audit Office Manager Li Zhiyu to discuss this method. It has already been decided, and Shen Jinmian, Chen Erlv, and Li Zhiyu have been tasked with drafting a plan to take to Shanghai and consult with Finance Minister Song. Once finalized, it can be implemented. He has also ordered the heads of other important national taxes, such as tobacco, alcohol, and stamp taxes, to draft reorganization proposals and submit them to the provincial government for discussion and improvement. According to Yang's opinion, the lack of progress in the province's politics is entirely due to the lack of financial resources. For example, the education sector requires 1.5 million yuan in funding annually, which was originally planned to be allocated from salt surtaxes. However, due to the salt tax deficit, only 40,000 yuan can be provided each month, resulting in the accumulation of over two months' worth of unpaid school expenses throughout the province, leading to shutdowns. Furthermore, construction projects are also unable to proceed due to a lack of funds, so projects such as dredging rivers, waterworks, hydroelectric plants, machinery manufacturing plants, and iron bridges, although the plans have been completed, cannot be carried out. Therefore, Yang is eager to fundamentally solve the financial problems. (July 28th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Higher Court's Plan to Improve Prisons Throughout the Province</h3>
<p>Lin Biao, the President of the Jiangsu Higher Court, has drafted a plan to reorganize the new and old prisons in Jiangsu Province and improve them, which has been submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review. An excerpt of the plan is as follows: Jiangsu Province only has four main prisons in Jiangning, Shanghai, Wuxian, and Nantong, as well as a branch prison and a temporary detention center in Wuxian. In the remaining 57 counties, except for Qidong, which was recently established and has not yet established a prison, there are 56 old prisons. These old prisons</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>are all remodeled from prisons of the previous Qing Dynasty. The houses are dilapidated, and the equipment is simple, which is completely unsuitable. Thorough renovation is essential for improvement. It is planned to expand and renovate the old prisons in various counties into new-style prison buildings on a yearly basis, or to select new sites for construction. It is tentatively planned to carry out one phase per year for ten years. The first phase, in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), will renovate the old prisons in Tongshan, Huaiyin, Jiangdu, Songjiang, Qidong, and Wuxi.

The third phase, in the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), will renovate the old prisons in Wujin, Baoshan, Kunshan, Gaoyou, Wujiang, and Huaian. The fourth phase, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), will renovate the old prisons in Yixing, Chuansha, Haimen, Donghai, Guanyun, and Ganyu. The fifth phase, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), will renovate the old prisons in Funing, Taicang, Changshu, Rugao, Dongtai, and Taixian. The sixth phase, in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), will renovate the old prisons in Xiaoxian, Fengxian, Baoying, Peixian, Fengxian, and Suqian. The seventh phase, in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), will renovate the old prisons in Taixing, Xinghua, Siyang, Lianshui, Dangshan, and Shuyang. The eighth phase, in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), will renovate the old prisons in Pixian, Nanhui, Jinshan, Jiangpu, and Jurong. The ninth phase, in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), will renovate the old prisons in Jintan, Lishui, Gaochun, Liyang, and Luhe. The tenth phase, in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), will renovate the old prisons in Qingpu, Suining, Yizheng, and Yangzhou. The plan to add new prisons is even more important. However, due to the current lack of funds, it is difficult to build all the new prisons in the province at the same time. It is also planned to carefully consider the situation in convenient and central locations in the province, selecting key locations to add eight new prisons, one new branch prison, expand one existing new prison, and build one new re-education facility for counter-revolutionary criminals, proceeding in eight phases, one phase per year. The first phase will add the First Branch Prison in Jiangning, with a capacity of 500 people, to house criminals from Jiangning, Jiangpu, Luhe, Jurong, Lishui, Gaochun, and other counties. Another 5th Prison will be built in Zhenjiang, with a capacity of 1,000 people, to house criminals from Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Danyang, Jiangyin, Yixing, Jintan, and Liyang. A re-education facility will be established in Suzhou, with a capacity of 500 people. The second phase will build the 6th Prison in Huaiyin, with a capacity of 1,000 people, to house criminals from Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Siyang, Yancheng, Funing, Baoying, and other counties. The third phase will build the 7th Prison in Jiangdu, with a capacity of 1,000 people, to house criminals from Jiangdu, Yizheng, Dongtai, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Taixian, Jingjiang, Yangzhou, and other counties. The fourth phase will build the 8th Prison in Tongshan, with a capacity of 1,000 people, to house criminals from Tongshan, Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Pixian, Suining, Suqian, and other counties. The fifth phase will build the 9th Prison in Taicang, with a capacity of 600 people, to house criminals from Taicang, Kunshan, Jiading, Changshu, Baoshan, and other counties. The 4th Prison in Nantong will be expanded, adding housing for 200 more people, to house criminals from Nantong, Haimen, Chongming, Rugao, Taixing, and other counties. The sixth phase will build the 10th Prison in Songjiang, with a capacity of 800 people, to house criminals from Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengxian, Nanhui, Jinshan, Chuansha, Wujiang, and other counties. The seventh phase will build the 11th Prison in Donghai, with a capacity of 600 people, to house criminals from Donghai, Guanyun, Ganyu, Shuyang, and other counties. The eighth phase will build the 12th Prison in Chongming, with a capacity of 500 people, to house repeat offenders from the entire province. Inmates already sentenced from this county are to be transfered to the 4th Prison in Nantong for execution. After each of the new prisons are gradually established, all the existing prisons in the counties will be uniformly converted into detention centers to improve order and appearance. In addition, the addition of inspectors and technicians specializing in inspecting, investigating, and supervising the construction of prisons, the establishment of prison schools, and the addition of new prison trainees to cultivate talent, and the establishment of juvenile prisons, reformatories, and ex-offender protection associations will all be gradually promoted and implemented in stages.</p>
<h3>Major Food Crisis in North China</h3>
<p>Local Production Fails to Meet Demand</p>
<p>External Sources Have Been Cut Off</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the provinces of North China are the richest wheat-producing regions. Flour mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces all purchase wheat from Hebei and Shandong provinces. From 1912 to 1916, the highest price for top-quality flour was $2.50 per bag, and the lowest price was $2.00 per bag. In 1917, due to the major flood in North China, the harvest decreased, and the price exceeded $2.50 per bag. The following year, with a good wheat harvest, the flour price fell back below $2.50. Since 1922, the flour price has been rising year by year. The reasons are: (1) Repeated internal wars have drastically increased military demand. (2) Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces have suffered from drought, floods, or insect plagues, resulting in a sharp decline in harvests. (3) Various exorbitant taxes and levies have been increasing. Therefore, since 1922, Shanghai flour has been imported from Dagu at an average of 400,000 to 500,000 bags per month due to its lower cost. After 1924, flour from the United States and Japan was also imported in large quantities, slightly squeezing out Shanghai flour. However, imports still averaged 200,000 to 300,000 bags per month. The selling price of Shanghai flour and Japanese and American flour in Tianjin was always two to three jiao cheaper per bag than local flour. Due to cost factors, Tianjin flour mills could not reduce their prices, resulting in a drastic decline in business and leading to their closure. Only two mills barely managed to survive. This year, since the price of gold went up, Japanese and American flour imports have ceased to Tianjin because increased costs have rendered them unprofitable. Two months ago, the Shanghai Customs House banned the shipment of rice and flour to northern Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Dagu, cutting off external sources, causing market prices to skyrocket. Fortunately, Hebei and Shandong provinces had a good wheat harvest, and the wheat price plummeted from over $12.40 per stone to $9.60-9.70, leading to the reopening of two flour mills. If there were no unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating prices, and wheat was calculated at $10 per stone, the flour price would have fallen below $3 per bag. However, not only did it not fall, but it rose to over $4. The price of unpolished rice also rose from $18 to $24. The newspapers have been reporting on the food panic for about a month, slightly alerting the municipal authorities, who telegraphed Yan Xishan, ordering all troops to refrain from buying rice and flour in Tianjin. According to the Bureau of Social Affairs' investigation, the rise in rice and flour prices was indeed caused by the cutoff of external sources and unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating prices. Tianjin itself requires over 40,000 bags of flour per day, and Beijing and Baoding also rely on Tianjin for supplies, totaling 100,000 bags per day. Even though Tianjin's four flour mills are operating day and night, they only produce over 20,000 bags. Yan Xishan's prohibition on troops buying rice and flour in Tianjin cannot be strictly enforced because Shandong province's flour production capacity is limited and cannot meet demand, making it necessary to purchase in Tianjin. Otherwise, hundreds of thousands of troops would face starvation. Zhang Yinglin, a counselor from the Taiyuan General Headquarters, came to Tianjin to investigate and decided that the best-quality flour produced by each flour mill would be sold for civilian consumption, while second- and third-quality flour could be purchased by the military. Thus, the four flour mills' daily output can only supply less than 10,000 bags for civilian consumption. According to the Special Wheat Flour Tax Bureau's investigation, from January to May of this year, 800,000 bags of Shanghai and American flour were imported each month. After deducting consumption, Tianjin currently has a minimum of 500,000 bags and a maximum of 800,000 bags in stock. Even without external flour imports in the next three months, North China will not face a food shortage. However, a panic is unavoidable after three months. Therefore, it is hoped that the war will end quickly to maintain the people's livelihood. Suppressing grain prices is currently the most important issue in alleviating the people's livelihood. Because rice and flour prices have already risen, the prices of coarse grains have also risen accordingly. Today, one yuan can only buy 16-17 jin of corn flour, whereas last year it bought 26-27 jin. The price of flour has reached $4.30 per bag, and small merchants are even adulterating it with stone powder and white corn flour, which is even more reprehensible. The Bureau of Social Affairs has recently joined forces with the Public Security Bureau, the Health Bureau, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Port Authority, and the eight agencies of the First, Second, and Third Special Districts to organize a Food Price Evaluation Committee. It is expected to be established on the 5th, after being approved by the Municipal Council on August 1st. Before the establishment of the Evaluation Committee, the Municipal Government is first requested to issue a notice prohibiting the raising of grain prices. According to those familiar with business conditions, the rise and fall of rice prices are entirely controlled by the Tianjin Milling Association and the Rice Shop Association. When the new wheat came on the market at over $11 per stone, they agreed not to buy it, repeatedly driving down the price to a few jiao over $9 per stone, and then bought it in large quantities. Now the wheat price has risen again to a few jiao over $11, so each flour mill can earn a net profit of $3,000 to $5,000 per day. The flour sold by the flour mills is priced at $4 per bag, but the large and small grain shops, knowing that the supply of rice and flour cannot meet demand, have also raised market prices to as much as $4.30-4.40 per bag. It is expected that after the establishment of the Evaluation Committee, it will be able to restore the value to what it was before the new wheat came on the market, that is, between $3.90 and $4 per bag. Even so, the flour mills have already purchased large quantities of wheat at low prices, and even if the flour price is suppressed, they will still make a substantial profit. It is suspected that the milling companies and rice shops will secretly manipulate the price of wheat, and the Evaluation Committee may be helpless. (July 31st)</p>
<h3>Zhu Maocheng's Talk Upon Passing Through Harbin</h3>
<p>The International Labor Conference's Proceedings</p>
<p>There Were Four Important Resolutions</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin reports that Zhu Maocheng (Director of the Department of Industry and Commerce), the Chinese government representative who attended the International Labor Conference in Geneva, returned from Europe yesterday. He is staying temporarily at the Grand Hotel for a few days to investigate Harbin's industrial and commercial situation before leaving Harbin and returning to Beijing. At 10:00 a.m. today, Zhu held a reception for Harbin reporters at the hotel to report on the proceedings of the conference. The following is a summary of his talk:</p>
<p>The Chinese government sent a total of two representatives to this session of the Labor Conference. The first representative was myself, and the second representative was Wu Kaisheng. The government also appointed a representative from the business sector, Wu Qingtai, the manager of the Shanghai Cement Company, and labor representatives, Fang Juehui and consultant secretaries, for a total of ten people. The government, business, and labor representatives together formed a full delegation. Since the International Labor Conference began, China has officially sent a full delegation only three times, including this session. Various countries have paid considerable attention to China's competition for an international position. China also has a representative office of the International Joint Conference in Geneva, with Wu Kaisheng as the director. This conference was attended by representatives from 51 countries, totaling 140 representatives and over 200 experts. Fortunately, the Chinese representative was elected as the vice-chairman of the conference. Representatives from Poland and Japan also served as vice-chairmen. China held the position of first vice-chairman, so it was three times the chairman of the meeting. So the position was also very appreciated by other countries. There were four important resolutions at the conference: (1) The Abolition of Forced Labor Resolution. This issue was proposed at the Twelfth Conference but did not achieve results. The Board of Directors submitted it for discussion at the conference. First, it was discussed in groups. This forced labor system originally violated humanitarianism. For example, Chinese laborers were forced to work during the European War, and various countries conscripted laborers during wartime. Although they were paid wages, the labor was still forced. Overseas Chinese workers have been subject to this kind of restriction. During the discussion, most countries supported the abolition except for colonial countries. Countries with backward economies, such as Germany, Portugal, and the Netherlands, did not openly oppose it for fear of appearing inhumane, but hoped to extend the deadline and not abolish it immediately. The Chinese representative actively advocated abolition based on humanitarianism. As a result, the majority supported the abolition, and it was decided to "abolish the labor system in the shortest possible time." A draft convention was established to solicit approval from various countries. To ensure future implementation, a conference will be convened again in five years to review the issue. We believe that the establishment of this resolution indirectly frees the eight to nine million Chinese workers abroad from bondage, so we are deeply gratified. After group discussions, it was submitted to the conference and passed by a two-thirds majority, and the original plan was implemented. (2) Regulations on Working Hours for Shop Employees. This resolution was discussed but unresolved at the Eleventh Conference. Eleven years ago, the First World Labor Conference held in Washington decided on an eight-hour workday, which most countries have already implemented. However, this has not yet been stipulated for shop employees who perform physical labor, so they requested to enjoy the same treatment. It was also discussed in groups. Due to various reasons, China greatly supported this eight-hour workday system, but at this time, it could not make an active statement. Therefore, this attitude was expressed in advance. As a result, this resolution established a draft convention and sent it to various countries for approval. (3) Regulations on Working Hours in Coal Mines. This resolution was of a very urgent nature and was proposed by the United Kingdom on a temporary basis. This resolution had two purposes: (1) Coal-producing countries and major coal mining industries requested to resolve the unemployment panic among coal industry workers and to alleviate the drop in coal prices. In recent years, the number of coal-producing countries and unemployed coal industry workers has been increasing, while coal sales have been decreasing. If the eight-hour workday system continues, it will be impossible. Therefore, it is intended to shorten the working hours to six hours, which will reduce the amount of coal produced, increase prices, and employ more workers. (2) Coal workers in various countries requested to shorten working hours. This matter was most actively advocated in countries such as England and Germany, but countries without coal worker unrest strongly opposed it, so the debate was the most intense. England and Germany requested to shorten working hours to seven and three-quarters hours, which was also impossible. Therefore, this resolution did not achieve results and was postponed for further discussion next year. (4) Internal Administrative Issues of the International Labor Conference. China advocated that China must occupy a seat when the directors are re-elected next year. After contacting representatives from various countries, various countries also believed that China's efforts in the international competition were commendable and attached great importance to the fact that China's entrance into the international arena was far too late. There are a total of twenty-four labor conference directors, twelve of whom are government representatives from various countries and twelve of whom are business and labor representatives (six each). Now the major industrial countries such as England, Germany, France and Italy all have one seat. When I gave a speech, I said that China has 2 million new workers, 8 million old workers, and 70 million farm workers. It is not a problem for England and France to be directors, but compared to Belgium, China's workers are already several times the number of its entire population, but China is not as qualified as Belgium to be a director, which is unfair. Various countries considered that the reasons presented by China were justified. At this conference, China was able to become the vice-chairman, which allowed it to have many opportunities to speak and be noticed, so the results were very good. Zhu also represented the government at the Berlin World Power Conference and the Brussels International Labor Vacation Conference. Due to his urgent need to return to Beijing, he parted ways with the other representatives and returned to China. (July 31st)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<h3>Reports of Joint Suppression by Lianfang in Southern Pudong</h3>
<p>Liujia Weir and Kongjia Que and other places bordering Jinshan County and Songjiang County are places where bandits gather. They cause trouble wherever they go. Recently, armed bandits have personally sent letters demanding money by a certain deadline, with no consideration for anything. The rampant nature of the bandits can be seen in this. Taibao A Shu is still hiding in the area. It is learned that the newly appointed Captain of the First Water Police Team, Fan Zhicheng, the Captain of the Third Anti-Smuggling Detachment, He Zikui, the Captain of the Fourth Anti-Smuggling Detachment, Pan Baozhong, and the Captain of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police Team, Xu Pucheng, have agreed to jointly suppress the bandits. They encountered the bandits in Kongjia Que and other places and are in the process of suppressing them. The patrol officer of the 15th Sub-station of the Caobing Precinct, Wu Zongchen, recently arrested a long-time bandit, Pan Axiang, in Shanyang. He had previously been sentenced to prison for a case and escaped. He recently relapsed. He has already been sent to the Songjiang court for trial.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Auctions Ferry Tugboats</h3>
<p>Bidding on August 12th</p>
<p>When the Municipal Public Works Bureau took over the Pujiang Ferry two years ago, the Municipal Government's Pudong Office transferred one public security ferry, seven tugboats, and two rowboats. The public security ferry has already been auctioned off. Tugboat No. 5 and rowboat No. 9 were allocated to the Bureau of Social Affairs' Parks and Fields for use. Tugboat "Gongdao" is being used by the Zhabei Shipping Office. Rowboat No. 8 was destroyed by a typhoon a few days ago. There are still five tugboats remaining. Since the new ferries have been put into service, they have been idle for a long time. It has been approved by the Municipal Government to auction off the remaining tugboats, "Gongji," tugboat No. 6, and three canopied tugboats, except for "Gongli" and tugboat No. 7, which will be kept in reserve. The announcement is as follows: Announcement: It is hereby announced that the city's ferry currently has one "Gongji" tugboat, tugboat No. 6, and three canopied tugboats, which have been approved by the Municipal Government for public auction.

<h3>O'Wen of the Dredging Bureau is Returning to His Country</h3>
<p>O'Wen, the foreign engineer and chief engineer of the Construction Department of the Dredging Bureau, was robbed and shot in May and sent to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. He has now recovered and been discharged from the hospital and has reported to the Bureau. It is reported that Engineer O'Wen's medical expenses cost about 5,000 taels, which were paid by the Bureau. Now, the directors of the Dredging Bureau believe that although Engineer O'Wen has recovered from the gunshot wound, he should be given eight months of leave to return to his country for recuperation due to the trauma, and a consolation payment of 1,000 taels to soothe his nerves. It is heard that Engineer O'Wen is scheduled to set sail on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Case of Social Bureau Investigator Obstructing Official Duties</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council bears responsibility</p>
<p>The court ruled the investigation concluded</p>
<p>Yunhua Silk Weaving Factory, No. 1088 Weituoma Road, dismissed its employee Ma Zongsui last month. Ma was dissatisfied with the dismissal and complained to the Social Bureau of the Municipal Government, requesting assistance. The Bureau Director, Pan Gongzhan, dispatched the Bureau's investigator, Mr. Zhu, to Yunhua Factory to investigate the reason for the dismissal. Mr. Zhu also tried to persuade the factory manager, Chai Bingkui, to re-employ him or, if dismissal was necessary, to provide generous compensation to cover losses. The wording was somewhat lacking in tact. Chai immediately reported to the relevant police station by telephone. The police chief ordered the detective, Jin Yangwu, to rush to the factory. After an inquiry, he invited both parties to the police station. The police chief then telephoned the Social Bureau and learned that Mr. Zhu was indeed an investigator dispatched by the Bureau. The Bureau also sent a staff member, Mr. Gu, to the police station to declare Mr. Zhu's mission to Yunhua. The police chief then ordered both parties to leave. The matter was thus put to rest. Now, Mr. Zhu suddenly filed a complaint with the Special District Local Court, accusing the detective Jin Yangwu and Yunhua Manager Chai Bingkui of obstructing official duties. The Procuratorate issued summonses, and yesterday morning, Jin and Chai were summoned. The prosecutor, Xu Mei, opened the court for investigation. The Municipal Council dispatched legal counsel, attorneys Bo Liang and Ru Baoyi, to court to argue the plaintiff should not sue Jin and others. The general argument was that if the Social Bureau sends personnel to the concession to perform duties, it should first notify the Municipal Council Police Department to assist. In this case, Mr. Zhu did not go to Yunhua Factory with prior notice. The Municipal Council originally intended to sue the investigator, but considering the current cooperation between the Chinese and concession authorities, it did not want to haggle over minor procedural errors, causing ill feelings. Therefore, after the Social Bureau sent someone to the police station to explain the misunderstanding, Zhu and others were allowed to leave. Furthermore, Yunhua's report to the police station was not in Chai's name, and detective Jin's investigation was also dispatched by the police station. The responsibility for the plaintiff's accusation of obstructing official duties should be borne by the Municipal Council, not the two individuals. Afterwards, Prosecutor Xu questioned Jin and Chai and ruled the investigation concluded. Jin and others were dismissed to await a decision.</p>
<h3>Record of Investigation into the Explosion at Nine Mu Di</h3>
<p>Ji Huoting and Shen Shiyou both released on bail</p>
<p>The Nine Mu Di Liu Wen Lane Sanhe Yong Copper and Tin Shop bought explosive materials, resulting in the death of two people and injuries to five others. The victims filed a complaint with the Local Court Procuratorate, which ordered the shop owner, Zhou Zhenqian, and Ji Delin Woodenware Shop owner, Ji Huoting, to appear. Both failed to do so. Yesterday, another order to appear was issued. At 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Zhao opened a preliminary hearing. The plaintiffs present were Lu Daxin, Zhu Desan, Wang Shenglin, Tang Xilin, Yan Dengshan, and others, five in total. All were scorched and battered. Some had their lower bodies blown apart, walking with difficulty. Some had the skin of their faces, hands, and feet blown off, resembling fiery ghosts, a truly horrifying sight. The defendants present were Ji Huoting and Shen Shiyou, representing Zhou Zhenqian to litigate. After Prosecutor Zhao's preliminary hearing, he ordered that Ji Huoting and Shen Shiyou both be detained pending bail, and Zhou Zhenqian himself was still strictly summoned to appear to clarify responsibility and investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Autumn Insect Falls into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>A lodger fought and rolled into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Ye A Yao did not die but must face official charges</p>
<p>At the Ning Shao Wharf in the South City, a porter, Ye A Yao, and another of his kind, named Autumn Insect, were sleeping in the open at the wharf the night before last. It is unknown how the two sides began to brawl and roll on the ground. Unexpectedly, they rolled into the Huangpu River. At that time, many people were enjoying the cool air and joined in the rescue. Ye A Yao was pulled out alive, while Autumn Insect became a companion of the river god. The water patrol officers arrived and arrested Ye and took him to the station. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Local Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Continued Capture of the Bandit's Wife</h3>
<p>Zhang Lianshan escapes without a trace</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Luo Jinzhang, a detective from the Sixth District of the Jiangsu Water Police Bureau, reported to the Third Sub-Station of the Fifth District and dispatched police officers to Hongzhen to rescue a five-year-old boy, Lü Yongchang, from Gaoyou Township. They also arrested nine suspects, including Li Weicai. At about 7:00 PM, they went to the Sixth District Police Station on Guangfu Road and dispatched police officers to a grass shed next to the Dafeng Factory, where they arrested the bandit's wife, Zhang Wang, and the bandit's child, Huang Hongzi, and searched for firearms and ammunition. This has been reported yesterday. It is now known that the bandit's wife, bandit's child, firearms, and ammunition were all seized by Hu Lizhong, the patrol chief of the Sixth District, and taken back to the Sixth District Police Station. After interrogation by the District Chief, Zhang Wang, the bandit's wife, confessed that she was 30 years old, from Yangzhou. Her paramour, Zhang Lianshan, had now fled and was indeed the mastermind behind the abduction of the Lü boy. The bandit's child, Huang Hongzi, was six years old and was born to her paramour's former wife. Since the abduction of the Lü boy in May, her paramour had taken her and others to Shanghai and hid them at No. 150 Shunjin Lane, Hongzhen North Street, where Yao Hecai, Shi Caiming, and others took turns guarding the hostage. Later, fearing leaks, her paramour moved again to this grass shed on June 15th of the lunar calendar. She and Hongzi lived there, while her paramour only stayed a night or two occasionally. Therefore, the firearms and ammunition were all hidden here. She claimed to know nothing about other circumstances, but she was very frightened of this matter, so she surrendered the firearms and ammunition as soon as she was arrested. After obtaining this confession, District Chief Ren deemed it a major case of kidnapping. Yesterday, he prepared a document and sent the bandit's wife and bandit's child, together with the one handgun, fifteen rounds of ammunition, nineteen pieces of clothing, two mattresses, two books, one bamboo box, and two strings of copper coins seized at the time, to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Five-Year-Old Child Suddenly Disappears</h3>
<p>Zhang Herong and Wan Qinkeng Carry Him Away</p>
<p>Xu Debiao, 43 years old, from Anhui Province, resides at No. 12 Yongting Lane, Zhong Shi, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, and is engaged in commerce. He has a son named Jin Gou, who is only five years old. He is plump and clever and is greatly loved by Xu. Yesterday morning, at about 8:30 AM, the child was walking and playing in the lane outside the door. His family was inside and did not pay attention. Suddenly, the child disappeared. Xu was alarmed and asked the neighbors everywhere. Only then did he learn that someone had glimpsed him being carried away by Zhang Herong and Wan Qinkeng, two people he knew from Changzhou. Xu then searched everywhere, but found nothing. Xu then filed a report with the Sixth District Police Station, requesting investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Gao Bingjiang Accused of Seducing a Virgin, Abandoning Her After Getting Her Pregnant</h3>
<p>Recently, a woman, Wang Lu, filed a lawsuit in the criminal division of the French Concession Court, accusing the defendant, Gao Bingjiang, of seducing a virgin and abandoning her after getting her pregnant, requesting investigation. The general idea was that the woman's daughter, who is 18 years old this year, was seduced and seduced into sexual relations by Gao Bingjiang, with whom she lived, in March of the year before last. At that time, the defendant promised to marry her as his wife, but unexpectedly, the defendant ignored her afterwards. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting investigation. The judge approved it and summoned the defendant yesterday, but he did not arrive. The plaintiff complained about the previous situation and claimed that Chen Ziqing, an important witness in the case, was present because Chen was about to leave Shanghai. Please summon him for questioning first. The judge approved it and immediately ordered Chen Ziqing to be summoned. According to Chen, in March of the year before last, the defendant Gao Bingjiang had an affair with the plaintiff's daughter. After the plaintiff found out, she reasoned with the defendant. At that time, the defendant knew he was wrong, so he promised to marry the plaintiff's daughter as his wife. However, the defendant already had a wife, so he agreed to marry her as his second wife. After the agreement was reached, he asked a businessman to act as a ready-made matchmaker. However, the businessman did not know how the defendant and the plaintiff's daughter were seduced. It was the truth. The plaintiff's daughter was questioned and said that in March of the year before last, the defendant seduced the woman to a certain inn under the pretext of playing mahjong and then raped her. Afterwards, the defendant agreed to marry the woman as his wife. The official asked how many times she had slept with the defendant. She replied about ten times. Judge Zhu ordered her to leave and wait for the defendant to be summoned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Police Officer Scheme to Steal Mauser Pistol</h3>
<p>Liu Furong is extremely bored</p>
<p>Shen Qian dismissed from his job</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Police Department reported that on the 18th of last month (July), the 27th freight train departing from the Zhakou Station to Shanghai was escorted by Chen Songshou and Hu Ziwen, railway police officers dispatched by the Police Chief Zhuang of the Hangzhou Section Police Department. Unexpectedly, Liu Furong, a dismissed police officer (formerly a patrol officer in the security team on both lines), asked Shen Qian, a police officer from the Shanghai Section Police Department, to ask Chen Songshou and Hu Ziwen, the escorting police officers from the Hangzhou Section, to have Liu Furong board the 27th freight train to Shanghai from Hangzhou. However, when the freight train passed between Jiaxing and Jiashan, the escorting police officers Chen and Hu were tired. The dismissed police officer Liu Furong then had the idea to steal Chen Hangshou's Mauser pistol and clothes. When the train passed between Fengjing and Songjiang, the dismissed police officer Liu Furong took advantage of their unguardedness and stole the items, jumping off the train to escape. After the train arrived in Songjiang, the two police officers Chen and Hu realized that Liu had stolen the Mauser pistol and clothes and escaped. They immediately reported to the Songjiang Station Police and rushed to the Shihudang area to pursue him, and joined forces with the anti-smuggling and road protection team to arrest Liu Furong and escort him to the Songjiang Anti-Smuggling Camp for detention. The next day, Police Chief Lou of the South Station Police Department prepared a document and dispatched detectives to the Anti-Smuggling Camp to bring Liu Furong, the dismissed police officer who had stolen the railway police's firearms and clothes, and Chen Songshou and Hu Ziwen, the escorting police officers from the Hangzhou Section, back to Shanghai. The South Station Police Department received the report and, according to Liu Furong's confession, he was 20 years old, from Jiangsu. After being dismissed from the security team, he went to the Songjiang Anti-Smuggling Camp as a service soldier. Because he stole the secretary's money, he was dismissed. He then went to Shanghai and lived in a small inn near the Haichao Temple. Because he could not find a job in Shanghai, he wanted to go to Hangzhou, but he had no money to buy a ticket, so he asked his former colleague Shen Qian to ask Chen and Hu, the escorting police officers from the Hangzhou Section, to take him to Hangzhou. After arriving in Hangzhou, he still could not find a job, so on the evening of July 18, he still went to the Hangzhou Station and begged Chen and Hu to take him back to Shanghai. After I got on the train, I shared a carriage with the two of them. After the train passed Jiaxing, I saw that they were a little tired, so I had the idea to steal his things. After the train arrived between Fengjing and Shihudang, I took advantage of their unguardedness and stole Chen Songshou's rattan basket containing firearms and clothes and jumped off the train to escape. I really wanted to use these firearms to rob people. After questioning by Police Chief Lou, he submitted it to the two-line police tax section for handling. Previously, the two-line police chief forwarded the situation to the Management Bureau for instructions and ordered that the case of the dismissed police officer stealing the cypress weapons and clothes, which was related to robbery, should be immediately transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for review and handling, and that Chen Songshou and Hu Ziwen, the escorting police officers from the Hangzhou Section, should be sent to the Hangzhou Section Police Department for disposition. Shen Qian, the Shanghai Section Railway Police, was also immediately dismissed and ordered to be handled separately by the South Station Police Department. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Police Chief Lou of the South Station Police Department prepared a document and dispatched police to escort the dismissed police officer Liu Furong to the Longhua Division for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Mahjong Game Turns into a Bloody Battle</h3>
<p>Started from a single copper coin</p>
<p>Hu Cai, a local old woman, 53 years old, lives at No. 6 Yanjia Lane, Zixia Road, outside the Dadongmen Gate. Yesterday afternoon at about 4:00 PM, she specially gathered Wang A Bao and Fan Xingling from Tongzhou and others to play mahjong. She happened to win alone, and the others all lost. Therefore, there were only two or thirty copper coins left on the table. As a result, she won another hand. Wang claimed that the money had been paid out, but Fan did not admit that he had paid out. I still have one copper coin left. It was decided to continue the battle. Seeing this situation, Ms. Hu refused to continue. Because of this, a disagreement arose and a conflict broke out. At first, the mahjong tiles were thrown randomly at the heads and faces, and then chairs were wielded to strike, as if facing a formidable enemy. Wang, who was over the age of destiny, was unable to resist and was struck in the head and other places, bleeding profusely. He fell to the ground in extreme pain, gasping for breath. Hou Rongsheng, the guard police officer of the 11th post there, heard about it and came to inquire. Because of the gambling, he brought Ms. Hu, Fan Xingling, and the injured person back to the Third Sub-Station of the First District, waiting for Director Jin to conduct a preliminary hearing and then review the case.</p>

<p>Guo, an eight-year-old adopted daughter of Zhang Lafai, a Nanjing native living at No. 33 Guanyintang, Tanjiachiao, Zhabei, was playing at the door the day before yesterday afternoon. Unexpectedly, a freight car driven by Shi A Er came speeding from Dachang back to Shanghai and knocked Guo down. The wheel ran over her neck and she died instantly. Zhang Ming, a police officer, arrived and arrested Shi and his car and took them to the Fourth District Police Station. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Local Court for trial.</p>

<h3>Li Landi Denies Aiding Thieves with Weapons</h3>
<p>Li Landi, a local, was sipping tea at the Xi'an Teahouse, No. 410 Xinzha Road, at 9:00 PM the night before last when he was arrested by Mao Yiwen, Shen A Fu, and Sun Dehui, detectives from the Hongkou Police Station. It was found that he was an accomplice of the thieves Wang A Lin and others who were captured at the Tongle Hotel on Aiduya Road a few days ago, and Li had dragon tattoos on both arms, making him easy to identify when he was arrested while shirtless. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court and interrogated by Judge Ge. According to the police station's lawyer, Li specializes in supplying firearms to thieves, and the investigation is still needed. Zhou Caigen, a thief in custody, testified that on the first day of this month, A Si asked me to borrow a gun from Li. Li said that the ship had not arrived, so he did not borrow it this time. If he could get a gun that day, he planned to rob a wealthy family in the lane next to the Baolong Hospital. When questioned, Li denied aiding thieves with weapons and said that Zhou's statement was completely untrue. The court ordered Li to be detained and tried together with Wang A Lin and others.</p>

His grandfather's name is A Cai Sheng, etc. The head of the station believed that the child's address was unclear and there was no way to inform his family, so he prepared a document and sent it to the General Bureau to appeal for recognition yesterday.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you in response to a news item entitled "Bomb Fails to Explode" in the local news section of your newspaper on July 29th. The news item described a conflict between the guard brigade platoon leader and the accompanying military police officer, including an account of soldiers throwing bombs. However, this account does not accord with the facts. The truth of the matter is that Zhong Wenjiang, the head of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's Shanghai-stationed transport section, has ordered Wang Zhitong, the conductor of the 4th train on that day, to investigate. The report stated that the second-class seats in the first and second-class carriages of the 4th train were full when the train was about to depart. There were more than a dozen passengers without tickets who had occupied the seats. The conductor asked Xia Jingyu, the military police squad leader accompanying the train, and three military police officers to negotiate with the soldiers and ask them to move to the third-class carriages. They refused. When the train was about to reach Fan Wangdu, the soldiers even wanted to make things difficult for the military police officers. The military police officers then forced them to get off at Fan Station. After the conductor's best efforts to persuade them, they finally agreed to move to the third-class carriages. The train was delayed at Fan Station for three minutes. There was no bomb thrown. I am writing to you to request that you publish this letter in the letter column to correct the record and avoid misunderstandings. I look forward to your cooperation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Transportation Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway</p>
<p>August 6th</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor-in-Chief:</p>
<p>I am writing to you in response to an article entitled "Life as Transient as Morning Dew" published in the news section of your newspaper on August 4th. There are some inaccuracies in the news item. The patient, Chen Gendi, is 31 years old and was sent to our hospital from Tianlu Shoe Store on Shanxi Road on July 28th for treatment. The disease he suffered from was fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. After medical treatment, the fever subsided and the diarrhea stopped, but the vomiting did not stop. In the afternoon of the third day, he suddenly had cold hands and feet. The doctor knew that it was a change of symptoms and tried to save him, but the medicine was vomited out and he was on the verge of death. He died at midnight on that day. The facts reported in your newspaper are inaccurate. I am writing to you to request that you correct the record.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Generalities of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhi Jing</p>
<p>Edited by Hong Peiqing, Published by Guangming Publishing Department, Sold at Daguan, Zhenmei, and Shan Bookstores</p>
<p>Shanghai is mysterious, so mysterious that it changes endlessly, making it difficult to grasp. Shanghai is also great, its great influence reaching all of China, perhaps even further. In short, Shanghai is Shanghai. Shanghai ranks sixth among the world's largest cities, making it worthy of attention, especially since we are constantly operating within the region of Shanghai and everything it encompasses.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the very Shanghai we stand on right now. If we go to the Bund or Nanjing Road, we can see tall foreign buildings. If we go to the Huangpu River, we can see many foreign merchant ships and warships. Beside these huge foreign merchant ships and warships, we might find inferior ships without any power, as well as warships that look like they have cannons—those are our Chinese merchant ships and warships. On the streets, we can see trams, cars, bicycles, rickshaws, and various other vehicles flowing like dragons. The bustling pedestrians also seem to be in a hurry. If you have the time, please go to Nanjing Road—but not just Nanjing Road. If you stand there from this moment until the same time tomorrow, you will not be disappointed. Every second will give you a view of the traffic and pedestrians. In short, everything is different from other places. It is more beautifully decorated, better furnished, and more luxuriously arranged than other places. There is more good than in other places, and more bad as well. Culture is more developed than in other places, but at the same time, all kinds of morbid phenomena are particularly prevalent. This is the mysterious Shanghai, and also the great Shanghai.</p>
<p>But what we can see is only the realization of Shanghai, which is to say the reality of Shanghai, and that is enough for our investigation and interviews. However, there is one thing about Shanghai that is most worthy of attention: Shanghai is abnormally developed. The history of this abnormal development is even more worthy of our exploration. Because the result of this abnormal development is a state of "one country, three administrations." All kinds of evil social realities are growing under the wings of foreigners. The obstruction of the exercise of Chinese administrative and judicial power has become an unexecutable disgrace within the spheres of influence occupied by foreigners. As a result, it has sown the distant cause of the May 30th Massacre. After the May 30th Massacre, the general public gradually became aware of the need to fight for national independence. The urgent issue is to demand the recovery of the concessions.</p>
<p>The purpose of "Generalities of Shanghai" is just that. In the "General Overview," it clearly tells us that Shanghai is a city forcibly created by Westerners occupying a piece of Chinese land. Therefore, the development of Shanghai is abnormal, and as a result, everything in Shanghai is abnormal. This kind of abnormality has given China a great fatal wound and given us Chinese people a great humiliation. For the sake of developing Shanghai and washing away the shame of our country, the author is also shouting in this book that the concessions must be recovered, hoping that all the citizens of Shanghai will devote themselves to the recovery of the concessions.</p>
<p>The content of this book is based on its purpose, telling about the evolution and current situation of Shanghai, so that we can know a general situation of Shanghai and recognize an outline of the activities of Shanghai. The whole book is divided into eight chapters, starting from a brief history of Shanghai and going straight to all the social phenomena of Shanghai.</p>
<p>If someone asked me, who has lived in Shanghai for many years, about the history of Shanghai and the driving force behind its development, I would definitely be at a loss for words. The chapter "A Brief History of Shanghai" has solved this problem for me. It starts from the seventh year of Xining in the Song Dynasty, more than 860 years ago, when Shanghai was just a small town with few households. Later, it gradually became a county, gradually attracted the attention of foreigners, gradually was occupied by foreigners, gradually was designated as a treaty port, and then gradually became the Shanghai of today. In the middle, foreigners expanded inch by inch and foot by foot, unscrupulously. Coupled with the incompetence of our country's former officials and the indifference of the Chinese people, it is really heartbreaking to read.</p>
<p>The chapter "The Culture of Shanghai" is particularly noteworthy in the entire book. Since Shanghai is abnormally developed, the culture of Shanghai is naturally abnormally developed. Shanghai is also a world of foreigners, so the culture of Shanghai is full of foreign stench. The most obvious case of China being subjected to cultural aggression is naturally in Shanghai. This chapter grasps this central idea, so it conducts a particularly detailed and meticulous investigation of the cultural organizations and cultural facilities organized by foreigners. It not only exposes the ambition of foreign cultural aggression, but also exposes the inferior nature of the Chinese people who willingly become slaves under cultural aggression. Affected by this, even in their own conversations, Chinese people will use English, forgetting that they are Chinese and forgetting that China still has the Chinese language. It is really unknown what their intentions are. We can naturally be aware of the horror of cultural aggression. The last section of this chapter talks about "Language and Public Opinion." The types of languages in Shanghai are many and complex, which is quite impressive. But the author also tells us that if you can't speak any language, you can still live very comfortably in Shanghai. He proves it with facts, writing in a humorous and interesting way. This also shows the mystery of Shanghai.</p>
<p>There is also a chapter "The Morbidity of Shanghai" that tells us that Shanghai is the breeding ground for all kinds of evil societies. Therefore, the morbidity of Shanghai is particularly prevalent compared to other places, and the patterns are also particularly clever. The conclusion of the investigation also tells us that cases of robbery and kidnapping are more common in the concessions than in the Chinese area. What is the inside story of the concessions, and how exactly do they protect the people? This is worthy of our contemplation. Just based on the results of a certain month's investigation, there were as many as 237 suicides and 113 robbery cases, as well as 14 kidnapping cases, and there were many more that were not investigated. What a terrible Shanghai!</p>
<p>This book is also full of photographs and works by painters such as Wu Youru, occupying more than half of the book. Each picture is lined with photographs or paintings. In these many photographs and paintings, we can better understand the past Shanghai, the present Shanghai, and the future trends of Shanghai. We deeply recognize that Shanghai has a great revolutionary history. Secondly, we can also see that these many great buildings in Shanghai are all made by continuously extracting money from all parts of China, and at the same time, they are also places where foreigners suck our Chinese people's blood. We should deeply recognize this. We should deeply awaken. It is no longer a time when we can indulge in the prosperous and enjoyable Shanghai. This is my feeling after reading "Generalities of Shanghai," and it is also the intention to introduce it to the readers.</p>
<h3>Folk Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>Collected Publications, Volume 1</p>
<p>Published by the Institute of Language and History, National Sun Yat-sen University</p>
<p>Generally, Chinese scholars neglect the most precious and greatest "folk literature and art." It is even rarer to hear of any in-depth research on it. Not long ago, a small number of scholars gradually began to pay attention to the exploration and collection of "folk literature and art," which is a very good phenomenon in Chinese academia. They were able to evolve from oral accounts of the masses to written records, leaving them for future generations so that those who love literature and art can have the opportunity to appreciate this true folk literature and art. Indeed, "in various countries in the East and West, there have been many specialized books on the study of folk literature and art. At present, regarding Chinese folk literature and art, such as the collection of myths and legends by Europeans and Americans, and the research on ballads and riddles by Japanese scholars, there have also been published grand and voluminous achievements. This really makes us feel ashamed and requires us to redouble our efforts, because we do not know the lives, thoughts, and literature and art of our own uncles, brothers, aunts, and sisters as thoroughly as foreigners do." This is a passage from "A Respectful Notice to Readers of Folk Literature and Art" in the collected publications. It should arouse a sense of urgency and inspire us to redouble our efforts without hesitation for our country's "folk literature and art."</p>
<p>The Folk Literature and Art Weekly is the crystallization of the efforts of colleagues at the Institute of Language and History of National First Sun Yat-sen University in "folk literature and art." The determination to study folk literature and art is indeed worthy of our special praise. Now they have compiled the issues from the inaugural issue to the twelfth issue, allowing us to gain a systematic observation.</p>
<p>The content is extremely rich, with mountain songs from various places, especially the collection from Meixian. There are also a few collections of songs from Dongguan, the Zhuang people, etc., which are not easy to obtain. These folk works from the countryside are particularly precious. There are also collections of riddles from Henan, folk proverbs from Fuchun, farm songs from Ruxu, children's songs from Jiangshan, barbarian songs from the Dan households, children's songs from Xiangxian, Fujian songs, and witch songs from Guangzhou. There are also detailed publications of Chaozhou legends, legends of several ancient birds in China, legends of Yangshi, legends of Bai'etan, and legends of Chen Mengji. There are also stories of the Kitchen God, stories of Lin Daqin, stories of birds, stories of ancient people, stories of Yingtai Shanbo and a scholar from Nan, stories of a foolish son-in-law, and myths of the Huizhou Pagoda and the Lianshui Pagoda... Almost all folk literature, such as songs, riddles, jokes, biographies, myths, stories, etc., have been collected as much as possible, becoming a treasure trove of folk literature and art. In addition, there are also translations of children's songs in English, which allows us to make a comparative study of foreign "folk literature and art" and our own. This kind of introductory work is truly extraordinarily great, so they once said:</p>
<p>In our eyes, the value of songs and proverbs is no less than that of Song lyrics and Tang poems. The importance of stories and legends is no less than that of official history and general mirrors. The importance of fables and jokes is no less than that of Zhuang Sheng. The beauty of Eastern humorous short tunes and storytelling is no less than the beauty of Kunqu opera and Yuefu ballads. Because this is where the national spirit is entrusted, and this is the expression of civilian culture. We collect, publish, organize, and study all kinds of literature and art of the entire Chinese nation for this purpose, which is the only mission undertaken by this publication.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that the purpose of the colleagues at the institute in publishing this publication is naturally based on the premise of studying "folk literature and art," so that we can understand the important position that "folk literature and art" occupies in literature, which actually exceeds the literature created by literati. At the same time, the colleagues at the institute study "folk literature and art" with the starting point of promoting the national spirit. The mission they undertake is to explore all kinds of literature and art of the entire Chinese nation. This concept full of national thought is truly admirable and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>They have also put in a lot of effort in the area of organization. For example, when publishing a "Wolf Dog Ballad," they added detailed footnotes at the end of the article, and at the beginning of the article, they added concrete and correct explanations with the insights of research. This kind of serious research attitude is also the only advantage they have. There are also many love songs collected here from various places, but these love songs are definitely not like the decadent love songs made by general literati with strong sentimental elements, because they are completely an outpouring of passion. Now I will record a few of them for the exploration of those who love literature and art.</p>
<p>Xiangxian Love Song</p>
<p>The bird does not know the fish in the water</p>
<p>The fish does not know the bird in the mountain</p>
<p>The younger sister does not know that the elder brother misses her</p>
<p>Who knows that missing her breaks his heart</p>
<p>The baggage and umbrella are on the shoulder</p>
<p>Looking back at my sister, tears streaming down</p>
<p>My lover is willing to eat broken-hearted grass</p>
<p>Rather not be separated on each side</p>
<p>Hepu Folk Love Song</p>
<p>My heart is desolate, my stomach is lonely</p>
<p>Sleeping alone on an empty bed with no mat</p>
<p>Three souls and seven spirits follow my sister</p>
<p>Ask my sister if she saw my lover when she slept at night</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, I look at the moonlight</p>
<p>There is no rice at home, I look at the yellow paddy</p>
<p>The eighteen-year-old girl looks forward to the days</p>
<p>The single younger brother looks forward to getting married</p>
<p>From these two love songs, we can see that some are earnest expressions of desire for the opposite sex, and some are love songs flowing from the heart when entering the initial stage of love. At the same time, we can see that the temperament of the people in the countryside of Hepu is really two beautiful songs. Also, for example:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the day before yesterday, my sister returned</p>
<p>Leaving only footprints on the sandbar</p>
<p>Seeing the footprints but not seeing my sister</p>
<p>Tears flow like the river</p>
<p>This expresses the scene of separation of young lovers, naturally revealing such true feelings and words, not like the sentimental poems written by general literati. Regarding this point, we have to praise the greatness of "folk literature," and its value can be clearly seen from this.</p>
<p>There are really not a few other love songs worthy of praise, and there are many legends about literary beggars, most of which are precious and not easy to obtain. Due to the limited space here, I cannot cite them one by one to share with everyone, which is a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>Finally, we must understand how rich the content of folk literature and art is. "There are many important materials that can be provided for the specialized research of scholars in sociology, anthropology, history, linguistics, folklore, religious studies, education, psychology, and various other disciplines." In terms of literature and art, folk literature does not know how many talented unknown writers have been buried. They have many beautiful songs, wonderful words, leisure stories, and anecdotes that are constantly circulating. If we can collect and organize them for everyone to enjoy, it will have unparalleled significance.</p>
<p>"Folk literature and art" represents the literature and art of the nation. Today, we should urgently promote it and encourage young people who love literature and art to explore this aspect. This "Collected Publications of Folk Literature and Art" is a treasure trove of folk literature and art that has been discovered and is truly worthy of recommendation.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (184)</h3>
<p>— Written by John Macy of America, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 48: American Essays and History</p>
<p>Thoreau was less a naturalist than a moralist. Although he sought genuine joy in the external world, he was particularly interested in the internal world, his soul, and his conscience. He wrote to please himself and to complete himself, just as he lived. He was not a misanthropic recluse, but rather a gentle and highly educated figure whose heart was full of the essence of books. Whether paddling a canoe or planting beans, he commented on books. In a sense, he was the least literary of writers, doing his narratives in a casual and offhand manner, and not worrying about the reception given to him by readers, either materially or spiritually. In another sense, he was a literary man with a keen feeling for style, the purest of all, and a master of style who was not at all strange or eccentric, yet individual. The section on style in "A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers" is, with the exception of Wordsworth's beautiful essay, the best little essay I have seen on that subject. The increasing conservatism of New England inevitably suppressed or reduced the revolutionary aspect of Thoreau's thought and strengthened his outdoor life. Nevertheless, he was a political rebel, and when the government was organized oppression, it was the duty of an upright man to resist it, etc., with this as the central idea. His essay "On the Duty of Civil Disobedience" is one of the classics of radical revolutionary thought. Once, Thoreau tried a passive resistance by refusing to pay taxes that he thought the government was using for criminal purposes. He was sent to jail, but because a friend paid the taxes for him, he was only detained in jail for one day. This is where his rebellion ended. When Thoreau died, Emerson thought that the world had yet to discover how great a man he was.</p>
<p>Daniel Webster, as a figure in public life, still has memorable value. It seems to us that he maintained his life through his literary style, through his spoken style, which he spoke in its original form. He was a speaker who held a position in a school that is now completely abandoned, and there is no one who can continue that task—even the most eloquent member of Congress today would be quite ridiculous to try to do so. Many of the issues of Webster's time have become dead matters. Only researchers of history are willing to dig them out. However, two or three of his speeches still have life, such as the speech at Bunker Hill, which should become part of the education of American youth.</p>

<p>The Huiluo Company on Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road declared that the current large-scale price reduction of the company is due to the accumulation of inventory, so the price is lower than in previous years. Not only is there no such low-priced goods in the market during this period of expensive gold and cheap silver, but even compared with last year's prices, it is much cheaper. This kind of loss-making bargain sale sacrifice of the company can be called unique. Among the low-priced goods, especially various fashionable and beautiful yarn before, which were sold at two yuan and five jiao to two yuan and seven jiao and five fen per yard, are now only sold for one yuan and five jiao. The diamond-studded glass yarn, which is five feet wide, used to sell for four yuan and five jiao per yard, but now it is only sold for one yuan. Other daily utensils, men's suits, children's clothing, art paintings, mirror frames, etc. are all discounted for sale, so the number of people visiting and buying goods at the company has been very high in recent days. The company has also hired educated Chinese girls to serve as receptionists for the convenience of Chinese gentlemen and ladies.</p>
<p>The Zhongqihua Company on Nanjing Road declared that the company's foreign goods department has just arrived with various timely goods, especially selling them at low prices. Especially the flower crepe cloth is six yards per yuan, the Russian flower cloth is six yards per yuan, the new striped bamboo cloth is four yards per yuan, and various flower linen yarns are from one jiao to one jiao and one fen and one jiao and two fen per foot. There are also flower Huaer yarn, etc., at low prices, and customers are crowded, which can be said to be unprecedented.</p>
<p>The main store of the Zhongxi Pharmacy on Simalu declared that the pharmacy has invented a kind of miraculous medicine for treating malaria, called P瘧 Ten-Pill Pill. It is said that no matter how mild or severe the malaria is, taking ten pills will cure it, so it is named this. It has been submitted to the Trademark Bureau for registration and has now been issued Registration Certificate No. 1696. The pharmacy plans to widely publicize and vigorously promote this medicine.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Youlian Film Company declared that the company first advocated the martial arts film "A Heroine's Love Affair," which has been welcomed everywhere since its premiere. Now the fourth episode has been filmed, and the plot is tortuous but not complicated. Although there are martial arts scenes, it still focuses on expressions. The Thirteenth Sister, played by Fan Xuepeng, is heroic and dignified, which is enough to add color to this film. It is currently engaged in editing and will be released soon. In addition, the third and fourth episodes of "The Wild River Heroine," written by Gu Mingdao, are also being worked on day and night to rush production.</p>
<p>The Hongshe Box Office declared that for the summer medical consultation and medicine distribution, the box office will hold a performance at the Grand Theater on August 9 (Saturday) to raise funds.
