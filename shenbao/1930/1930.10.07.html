<p>凡時會所至往往其事發於一處。而盛行於各地。此世人所謂潮流。蓋人之心思。每因有所感觸而發。又因多所欣羡而成。故凡一飲一食一衣一飾一居一室之微。　有所謂時尚。合其流則爲新奇。反其流則爲陳腐。日用之物如是國家之組織。政治之施行。亦復如是。工商業足以興盛國家則羣趨於工商業議會制勝於專制。則羣趨於議會制。捧喝黨成功於意國。則世界之有捧喝黨者。接踵而起。資本集中法。成功於美國。則世界之商業類多資本集中。更以最近之事實而論。南美之共和國。一有起而革命者。於是其他之共和國亦多革命。人類之相應相效。固有不知其所以然而然者。非可强爲非可强制也不但人事如此有時人世災惠之臨。亦復如是。舉凡大風大雨大寒大熱。以及地震疾疫之有牽連或波及之關係者。固不必論。至若英愛爾一零一號之飛船遇禍。喪失生命多人。而由德赴奥之運客飛機。亦因失事而致喪九人之生命。是乃近年以來航空界進步以後稀有之事。而乃接踵而起。一若潮流之所趨者。是又何故也。</p>

<p>外部一部職員暫留威</p>
<p>王氏定今日晨車赴都</p>

<p>接收經過　威埠係於一日晨接收、該地全部財産、以及關務鹽務司法郵政電報、均已接收完竣、即由余分别移交與各主管機關派赴威埠之接收人員、英國駐威海衛大臣莊士敦、及駐威海衛劉公島英海軍即於二日下午全埠離去、以各項事務叢雜、現外部歐美司帮辦朱世全、科長葛祖爌及方祖寶等、暫留威埠十日、協助管理專員徐祖善辦理一切、</p>
<p>英人市政　威埠租借與英國、巳達三十二年、面積二百八十一萬方英尺、人口在三十萬左右、經英人之銳意經營、市政極爲可觀、全埠房屋土地、毫無窳敗不整潔情形、居民衣着樸實、不眩耀富麗、亦無衣衫襤褸之輩、人民安居樂業、構訟之事極少、即相見法庭、亦不難解决、該埠諺語有「原告傳被告、被告一定到」、一語、詢之事實誠然、蓋凡發生訟事、法官先訊之原告、即將傳票交原告送達被告、被告準時能出庭、更者威埠無瘦弱之馬匹、馬車最多不得乘三人、凡有發現馬匹瘦弱、警察即牽之入官、每日給料　養期以十日、使之肥碩、由原主給值每日五角領去、如逾期不領、則以此馬拍賣、拍賣所得、除十日所費共五元外、餘欵仍給之主人、鷄鴨則無倒提之事、必挾於脅下入市、過去之市政如此、故居民之對莊土敦、咸感激涕零、彼輩幼稚、缺乏國家觀念、亦直接生活上之感受所致、</p>

<p>威民請願　威埠英人本設有海關、凡進出口貨一律值百抽一、故附近各地貨物、如山東山産之落花生等、商人取巧、均趨該埠出口、自此次接收、總稅務司署即派定稅務司、偕同財部關監督到埠、於二日張貼上月二十九日之佈告、調查全埠存貨、市民即推舉代表、向余請願、並要求威埠如中山港之闢爲無稅口岸、當經余解釋說明、稅收全國一律、中山港因香港、胡蘆島因大連·競爭關係、稍異於各地、威埠附近、則靑島烟台、均國人所經營、故不能厚於此而薄於彼、如於稅</p>
<p>則逐漸增高一層、當可代向中央致意、市民認爲滿意、</p>
<p>劉公島上　劉公島遜清海軍提督丁甲山、曾殉難其地、故該地尚不少曩時遺制、然經英人之經營、土地亦出資收歸公有、已成一片樂土、此後於署期中、仍允許英人及英軍避暑、機關如英海軍俱樂部、醫院旅館、仍由英人經營、</p>
<p>一艦留威　此次派軍艦赴威埠、原恐當接手時、發行滋擾、或干涉市政事、故派艦赴該地鎭攝、現海琛巳載余返靑島、鎭海及一部陸戰隊、則仍駐威、秩序甚佳、本人定明晨（即今晨）返都復命云、</p>

<p>線人報告係綁票</p>
<p>捕房猶未能確定</p>
<p>自來水筆手槍可怕</p>
<p>濃烟一陣令人昏迷</p>
<p>移徒定期綁票　匯山捕房華探目蘇應根、於本月四號、得線人報告、謂有某帮匪徒、欲至匯山路桃源里綁架某姓居户、蘇探目得報、即禀明捕頭、協同華探長張芝卿·蘇長生·包探楊璽臣·李連川·劉學成·陳連經·石寶瑛·等通班中西探員、分别化裝、至桃源里附近四散埋伏、至下午五時許、即有二○八五號汽車駛來、在桃源里弄口（按該弄弄口共有七處可通）繞行四次、約二十餘分鐘、始停於匯山路舟山路、</p>
<p>在此守候首領　車中跳下三人、立於路旁、喁喁私語、而探員李連川適立於三人之旁、聞彼等言、今日附近巡捕頗多、恐不易得手、不如明日再來、　並向李探謂汝係何人、李答係同志在此守候首領、（按此次該匪等組織頗爲複雜、故自己同黨、尚不認識）等語、</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑  海客　　甲—你覺得這香烟的味兒怎麽樣要是吸滿了一千枝。將紙殼兒送到烟公司去就可奉贈一隻旅行用的皮箱。　　乙—算了吧呌我一口氣吸一斤枝香烟。那我就用不着皮箱。還是送我一口棺材吧。　　母（在電車中）—孩子。你快快立起來。將這座位讓給他老人家坐。你不見他弔在皮帶子上。很吃力麽。兒—母親父親是最喜歡皮帶子的。不見他在家裏時。常常拿着皮帶子揪我麽。如今給他弔在皮帶子上。正是投其所好。　　主婦（吩咐伊家的一個呆僕）—阿王。你到弄口肉店裏去問那大胖子老板。有没有猪脚。　　呆僕—太太知道了。我立刻去看。（過了一會。空手回來。）　　主婦—怎麽樣你看有没有猪脚啊。　　呆僕—太太。我曾子細看過那大胖子老板的一雙脚。見他正穿着皮靴子。看不出猪脚來。因此也不敢問他。　　妻—親愛的。這一件新斗籩。你看上去以爲如何。　　夫—我看上去似呼是我半個月的薪水。蕭案感言  趙鼎銘　　蕭信庵女士此次應聘往南洋安汶島孟加錫服務華僑培德學校。受荷蘭渣華輪公司大二副的侮辱。種種經過以及荷屬僑胞和國人同聲憤慨。已經本報盡情披露。我人對於蕭女士以孤子一身航海泛洋的熱心僑敎。一定是以爲不可多得。伊在船中悲凉的况味。非親身經歴其境的旅人。是不會體貼到的。但伊的受窘的情景。我人假如易地而想。當能禮會到伊那種恐怖惶急的一二。而引起同情之　。下邊是鄙人個人對於蕭案的感言。　　蕭女士的面貎。我似乎於一天在東方圖書出版社。碰見黄警頑先生拿大批赴南洋的女敎師護照上附黏着的照片上看見。不過因熱心社會事業的黄君。慌慌忙忙地邊談邊走的當兒。我也依稀比較了下子。蕭女士的丰儀。似乎比别的幾位英氣勃勃些。但在伊們一致儉樸的裝束。和個個興奮的態度上觀察。令人不由不欽佩伊們爲僑敎而這樣犧牲的精神。并且發心祝福伊們。但當伊們八月十四日出航後還不滿一月。報上就看到被阻上岸。原船駁回的二三位赴南洋的女敎師來。有血性的人們看到。能不憤慨嗎。九月廿六廿八兩日各報一律迭次刊載關於蕭案的種種。我想這條身子凡是黄帝族的血統。天天會走動的。對於蕭女士所受的侮辱。同樣的會奮激的吧。蕭女士不顧自己的心之重創。和個人一時的顔面。毅然决然一五一十的道出。同時各會團各學校紛紛通電後援。并督促國民政府嚴重向荷國交涉。我想凡是有理性的國度。總該主持公道。而蕭案也不難得到完滿的解决的。但是我看到蕭女士致友人函有「生在人間。有何樂趣。信之生命不足惜。惟念上有老母。將何以安其心。偷生數日。不過爲此而已。」等等的消極口吻。深望蕭女士。今後不惟不可悲觀。而且不必悲觀。應當將這等大無長的精神。晚加發揚光大。將服務社會的本能。更加表現。要說這點白璧微玷。是掩不了至高無上的品質的。　　再一方面盼望中華全民族的男女靑年。個個覺悟。一致聯合足來。站在靑天白日旗幟籠罩之下的陣綫上。向前進展。不然種種的恥辱。是會一重重一次次追襲來的。觀潮小誌  壽秋情　　錢江潮音。聲聞中外。桂子香時。尤爲大觀。載諸史籍。傳之人口。未見者固以一睹爲快。曾經者亦屬百觀不厭。潮形不一。有大有小。有整有缺。咸如疊雪。或似排山。月夜觀潮。尤多佳趣。錢塘潮之膾炙人口者。實具此莊嚴奇偉之相。非他處所能及。聞今秋潮汛極大。十餘年來所未有。朋友相見。輒以此資談助。惟予自庽杭以來。觀潮者屢矣。高者不過四五尺。小者無論已。雖極潮湃之能事。未臻奔騰之化境。自歎緣吝。因之遲遲。日昨飯後。游興忽動。偕次兒英威步行至江干。爲時尚早。坐第一碼頭之浮船上。聞人談江上什事。頗堪發噱。而英威不復能耐。乃登岸啜茗於觀海樓憑欄小望。江水泱泱。惜樓高漢遠。潮來或不能切觀耳。旋聞人言。西興潮較江干爲高大。最高一日。竟及汽車站之腹部。一般臨江候渡者。幾至箱籠盡濕。予始憬然。今日仕女渡江者較往日爲多。蓋有由也。西興江邊。與三郎廟相隔不過十里。頃刻可達。挈英威登輪南渡。抵岸觀者已蟻聚。浮橋之盡處。被潮冲塌一大塊。塘邊積水猶存。浪大可想。環行車站一周。則渡頭紅旗已舉。汽笛不鳴。知潮將來矣。恐遭波及。乃擇高地而不碍視綫者竚立而待。時人聲驟起。羣噪潮來。萬目睽睽。盡注江心。遠望天水間。白綫一縷。出没烟波。漸上漸大。漸大漸近。如卷畫軸。如披雪練。空中隱隱若有雷鳴。由微而小。由小而動。此時天地之氣。人物之形。不期而肅。轉瞬間。潮已如千軍萬馬捲地迎來。雪浪排空。横江十里。風起雲涌。心駭目眩。大地爲之震驚。江河爲之攣色。岸高數丈。浪猶攫人。一瀉百里。水自天來。奔騰激越。水嘯雷鳴。嗚呼。壯哉。此潮誠天下之大觀也。亦吾生第一之創見。私幸見機。得廣心眼。最妙者。潮至橋邊壁立數丈激越飛流。頓成奇觀。立塘邊者。猝不及防。相顧失色。踞橋上欄杆者。衣履盡濕。狼狽不堪。驚魂甫定。不覺相對自笑。大膽婦女。同嘗滋味。面紅耳赤。亦觀潮聲中一趣聞也。潮去水漲。高與塘平。聲隆隆然。猶有餘威。披襟立浮橋上。放眼四觀。茫茫蒼蒼。别有天地。非復舊觀。快哉。快哉。豈平日夢想所能及也。還抵南星巳萬家燈火時矣。此行雖稍覺勞頓。然心臆之快。得未曾有。今日追記。猶覺潮聲在耳。錄寄自由談。以告同好。六足牛考  繡君　　日前道經花花世界。見有請看六足奇牛之旗幟。心異之。以赴友人之約。未遑入覽也、歸而冥心臆測似此鮮明之揭　。高懸於南京路中。詎委巷流傳游談無根者比海上各大報余强半瀏覽。未見有奇牛之記載。抑又何也之六足之奇牛。不識來自何方。正思檢最近之各報。以資參證。適見本談載定　君誌異牛一則。始知自滇省農民李仲山家來也。駢　枝指之見於古籍者。展笈紛如。獨六足牛。則殊不多觀。嗜博愛奇如余者。烏能不遠討遐搜。以貢獻於愛閱本談諸君前。惜腹笥所陳。時鄰弇陋。不足爲考古者參稽之助耳。茲就記憶所及排比如下。　　舊唐書五行志云。貞元四年二月。太僕寺郊牛生犢六足。太僕寺卿周皓白幸相李泌。請上聞。泌笑而不答。元史五行志云。至正二十八年五月。東昌聊城縣錢鎭撫家。牛生黄犢六足。前二後四。湖廣通志云。嘉靖三十九年。鍾祥民家牛生六足。同治上海縣志云。萬曆二十八年庚子。創側民家生水犢。兩手六足。前四後二。　　萬曆上海之六足牛。二申野錄亦載之。庚子距今已三百三十年。今始再見滇省之六足牛於花花世界芝蘭室。不可謂非異聞也。暇當躬往參觀焉。若夫武后元年。有獻三足牛者。見朝鮮僉載。北齊後主武平二年。并州獻五足牛。見隋書五行志。萬曆二十九年。三山民家。牛生一黄犢七足。見江南通志。天啓三年。辰州府民家牛産犢。四目四耳八足兩尾。見湖廣通志。俱足與六足牛參互考證也。爰附述之。以備采摭。趙鐵橋先生行述（三）  趙光祖　　袁時。京津黨人千數百。各自爲戰。無統一組織。先君與汪黄等組織京津同盟分會。京津黨人多入會。未幾而斃良弼。炸袁世凱張懷芝。　　州。燒北京城。攻天津。殉難者多分會烈士。而彭家珍先生最著。創刊天津民意報。汪總編輯。先君任發行。與上海民立報爲國中兩大日報。溥儀遜位。兩報與分會之力爲多。　　袁世凱受任臨時大總統。先君知二次革命不可緩。與黄復生謝慧生諸先生組「俠團。」購掘地機。掘地道。欲炸天津督署。舉兵討袁。袁之軍政執法處誣爲「血光團。」捕殺二十三人。布其罪。有「匪首趙鐵橋」之語。先君逃上海。而宋遯初先生被刺。湖口起兵。先君與陳英士張靜江諸先生謀攻上海製造局。兵敗。天津民意報封。先君亡日本。聞北京殺黨人三千餘。投其屍于南下窪。慟哭曰。「此清末黨人集會必經之地。何圖清亡而袁世凱殺吾黨數千人于此。」民國四年。孫總理任先君爲中華革命黨四川支部長。兼籌北方討袁軍事。袁世凱死。先君再至北京。　　民國六年。川滇黔軍相攻。先君歸成都調解之。熊錦帆先生奉總理命誓師重慶。約滇黔軍北伐。召先君參軍事。七年。任先君爲四川靖國各軍總司令部財政處處長。八年。四川省長楊滄白先生任先君爲濬川源官銀行總理。九年。川戰起。先君來上海。十一年。集股辦上海雙輪牙刷公司。川中革命軍將皆舊交。輒牽率而爲之奔走。十二三年間。國民黨改組。先君數至廣州。謁總理。陳川中黨務軍政。頗蒙嘉納。十四年。候總理疾于北京。參國民軍軍事。與第三軍軍長孫禹行先生過從尤密。總理殁。先君還上海。熊錦帆先生被禁虎門。先君走廣州。南昌。南京。白其寃而迎之于虎門。曰。「頗憶成都假入獄否。今眞出獄矣。吾爲救六君子至北京。後一年。迎汪黄出獄。於今十餘年而又迎君。往事如何可說。願自今忘之。」因相與一笑而俱來上海。莘友姑丈聞錦帆先生已出獄。亦自四川來。居數月。歸。前年病死。自鹿生姑丈出獄後數月死于合江滇軍。至莘友姑丈之死。六君子者喪其五。永寗三傑。惟先君在。今又爲局事死矣。天之于黨人。何其酷也。　　先君諱鐵橋。初諱猷。一諱式金。發行民意報時。諱鐵。以民國紀元前二十五年四月十日生。年十歲。叔父鐵椷生七月。遭先祖母之喪。依先曾祖母及先祖以養以敎。以至於成年。出入生死危難之中。先曾祖母及先祖雖甚憂之而勿禁也。民國六年。先君兄弟姊妹十一人。存者四人。皆來成都。迎祖就養。未十日而先祖棄養。八年。迎養先曾祖母。逾二年而先曾祖母亦棄養。先君常哀痛之。光祖等于先君之生也。未有一日之養。乃今靦然在憂服之中。而莫知殺父之仇。其尚得爲人也邪。天乎。痛哉。心上温馨（二八九）  包天笑　　第十四回　翠涙竹斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離　　左詩晨道。給人裝烟是最壞的事。往往有許多人。以爲給人裝裝是不要緊。弄弄白相相。久而久之。連裝烟的人。也吸上了　。吸烟的人。他自己吸了烟還敎人裝。當然是個舒服朋友。裝烟的人。吸上了癮。可就難了。最初自然揩揩吸烟的人的油。到了後來。你的生死之權。操在吸烟人的手中了。你要自己吸烟呢。没有這筆錢。你要不吸呢。癮上來了。眞是難過。因此就有打嗎啡針的。吞紅丸的。從此性命也給送掉了。翠筠道。那我倒不至於上這個當。我裝了好幾年烟。自己從來不吸一口。偶然空鎗呼呼。也覺得苦的搭。點没有什麽意思。我眞不懂人家爲甚的沉溺在鴉片烟中。以至弄得身敗名裂。家破人亡呢。所以我想我横竪自己不碰一碰的。便給伊裝裝也嘸啥。就是再卑屈一點。我也可以將就。不想他們佔了第一步。便想佔第二步。到後來踏上了你的頭上來。不許你出頭了。我要是不出來。再没有兩三年。我只好死在他家了。就像我一個小姊妹。喚做洪蓮香的。生生一條性命。不是斷送在那殷家嗎。這件事閙到了做文明戲。二少在報館裏。總應該知道的呢。左詩晨道。洪蓮香這個名字好熟。怎樣一件事。我巳記不清楚了。旣然是你的小姊妹。你總知道這事的底細了。怎樣一條性命。送在人家手裏。翠筠道。講起那件事。眞正可憐。洪蓮香是我一個頂要好的姊妹。伊比我小兩歲。不用說。伊的面孔身架。一切都比我好。人又文靜。從來不聽見伊喉嚨響一響的。伊本來是個好出身。伊的父親。聽說還是一位老秀才。在人家處館敎書。無奈運氣不濟。命途蹭蹬。憂憂鬱鬱的死了。死了以後。身後更是蕭條。一個母親。就生下他們姊弟二人。伊的兄弟年紀還小。連讀書之資也無所出。眞是天天過大年夜。到後來。走向了末路。蓮香便墮入平康了。伊的身世。比我還要苦。我本來是鄉下人。父親不過是一個鄉下銀匠。原是小人小家。伊却比我不同了。父親是個秀才。伊的祖上。什麽舉人翰林都有。雖說是窮。也是一家書香人家。却不想到他們那一代。女兒吃堂子飯。從前我在普慶里的時候。和蓮香在一個門口。要算我們兩人是最要好。伊和我講起伊家中的事情。常常淌眼涙。</p>

        <h1>1930.10.07</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Chiang Kai-shek Proposes Convening the Fourth National Congress <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>First, Hold a Plenary Session of the Executive Committee (Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek submitted a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, which read: "To the esteemed Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the current war to suppress rebellion is fundamentally aimed at establishing lasting peace within the country and serves as the true foundation for national unification. During the military operations to quell the rebellion, the Central Government has received strong support from the people nationwide. As the military campaign concludes, it is imperative to meet the expectations of the people. In my opinion, the most pressing task is to convene the Fourth National Congress as soon as possible to determine the agenda for convening a National Assembly, set the date for promulgating a constitution, and formulate a provisional constitution applicable during the period of political tutelage before the constitution is enacted. I humbly submit my humble observations to the esteemed committee. Our party, following the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, implements the nation-building program and temporarily adopts a one-party rule, aspiring to serve the public good and expedite the convening of the National Assembly, which was clearly instructed in the late Premier's will and should be diligently followed. However, since unification has just been achieved and the evil habits of warlord separatism have not been completely eradicated, I am deeply concerned that the convening of the National Assembly may be marred by reliance on military force, coercion of elections, bribery of politicians, and fabrication of public opinion, which could lead to disputes and hinder national reconstruction. Therefore, we first engaged in disbanding conferences to seek the actual elimination of warlords. Unexpectedly, this provoked rebellions by fake revolutionaries and real warlords, and the Central Government had no choice but to launch a punitive expedition. After this war, with the warlords completely eliminated, all politicians, bureaucrats, traitors, dregs, and corrupt elements will have no means to carry out their plots to harm the country. With discipline restored and morals renewed, there is hope for unified thought and stability for the nation. Therefore, the National Assembly becomes both possible and necessary to convene. Moreover, during this war, the rebel forces gathered all reactionary factions from across the country but ultimately could not avoid defeat. Therefore, after this war, no warlord will dare to undermine unification or rebel against the party and the nation. Thus, our party can solicit the public opinion of the people nationwide and prepare to return state power to the people so that they can jointly take responsibility for building our nation based on the Three Principles of the People. The date for promulgating the constitution, as well as the previously established guidelines for political tutelage, should be formally decided by the National Assembly. The assembly should also be jointly responsible for preparing the constitutional drafting conference. Before the constitution is enacted, if it is necessary to formulate a provisional constitution applicable during the period of political tutelage, so that the guidelines for political tutelage and the political program in the declaration of the First National Congress can be better understood by the people, it can also be discussed and decided by the National Assembly. However, this matter is of great importance. All decisions to convene the National Assembly and prepare proposals to be submitted to the National Assembly should be made by the National Congress of our party to demonstrate seriousness. I hereby propose that the Fourth National Congress of our party be convened early, three months from now. If the esteemed committee does not deem this inappropriate, please convene the fourth plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of this term as soon as possible to decide on this important issue, so as to meet the expectations of the people nationwide. I humbly submit this proposal and await your decision." Chiang Kai-shek kowtows, Jiang (Special telegram of the 6th).</p>
<h3 id="e2">National Government Orders Delay in Implementing the Abolition of Likin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Will Pilot a Business Tax (Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 6th, stating: "Upon examination, all likin and taxes similar to likin nationwide were previously ordered to be abolished from October 10th of this year. Now, according to the report from the Ministry of Finance, the military campaign has not yet concluded, and a delay of two months is requested for implementation, etc. This should be temporarily approved for delay. However, preparations must continue actively to ensure implementation before January 1st, 1931. The Executive Yuan is directed to instruct the Ministry to earnestly comply with this order." (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to prepare for compensatory measures after the abolition of likin, the Ministry of Finance issued a general order to the finance departments of all provinces yesterday to prepare for a pilot business tax before the abolition of likin is implemented. The tax rate is set at 10 per mille. If the pilot is successful, it can be designated as a form of compensation for likin. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Central Army Occupies Zhengzhou Railway Station <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Yang Hucheng's Troops Approach Luoyang The Pinghan Railway Reaches Xuchang Directly (Nanjing) Guizhou telegram: After the Central Army captured Zhongmou, it advanced to Baisha and occupied Zhengzhou Railway Station. The enemy in Zhengzhou City retreated to the northwest in confusion. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng's troops advanced on the 5th at noon, with the left wing moving from the north mountain front and the right wing crossing the Tiexie Ferry, 15 li from Luoyang. It is reported here that Luoyang City was captured at dawn on the 6th. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 52nd Division telegraphed Nanjing: "We captured Zhongmou at Chen [7-9 AM] on the 4th and are now pursuing the enemy towards Zhengzhou. The vanguard has reached the vicinity of Baisha Town. Zhengzhou can be taken any day." (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hankou telegram on the 6th: The Central Army has occupied Xinzheng and is approaching Zhengzhou. The Pinghan Railway express train will run directly to Zhengzhou starting today. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: Zhang Weixi's Third Division and the troops of Kong Fanlin and Deng Baoshan fled north through Xinxiang and were intercepted by our army. Surrounded on all sides, the enemy is now entrenched in Xinxiang City and the northern villages, fighting like trapped beasts. The soldiers are disintegrating and surrendering one after another. A complete resolution is expected soon. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Central Army captured Kaifeng, the center of the war shifted to Zhengzhou. In addition to the existing troops in Zhengzhou, Liu Maoen and Hao Mengling from Zhengdong, and Fan Xiji and Mao Bingwen from Zhengxi, have all rushed to the factories east and west of Zhengzhou, within a range of four or five li. Zhengzhou is in a desperate situation. Previously, Feng Yuxiang, seeing that the situation was hopeless, handed over military affairs to Lu Zhonglin and went to Taiyuan to meet with Yan Xishan to discuss the aftermath. Now that Zhengzhou is likely to fall at any moment and Shaanxi is on a dead end, almost cut off, he is deeply afraid that the loss of Zhengzhou will make it impossible to recover. Therefore, he temporarily handed over military affairs to Sun Dianying to maintain. Lu, on the one hand, telegraphed Feng for instructions, and on the other hand, summoned senior military officers to discuss countermeasures and aftermath strategies. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: The 20th Division, Xu Kexiang's troops, moved from Dongming to Lanzhou and dispatched a regiment of troops to Zhuju Township to search for the remnants of the enemy. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Seventh Army Staff Office telegraphed that the remnants of the enemy south of the Luo River have been completely cleared. Our main force has crossed the Luo River. The left wing is approaching Xinan and has occupied Tonglezai, Jinguyuan, and the West Luoyang Railway Station. The right wing has occupied Tieshudu from Baima Temple. Luoyang can be recovered soon. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hubei Garrison Brigade captured 4,000 prisoners in Xuchang and transported them to Hankou for resettlement on the 5th. The New Tenth Division also received 2,000 people from Jie Xie. The Pinghan express train runs directly to Xuchang, and ordinary trains still reach Yancheng. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Longhai telegram: The Central Army has reached the suburbs of Zhengzhou. Various mercenary troops and former Feng-Yan troops, as well as the Red Spears, have expressed their support for the Central Government and requested immediate reorganization. It is believed that the enemy has been completely annihilated, etc. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Northwestern Army gathered in Zhengzhou generally completed its withdrawal on the 5th. The Central Army occupied Zhengzhou on the Mid-Autumn Festival, fulfilling Chairman Chiang's bold statement of spending the Mid-Autumn Festival in Zhengzhou. Chiang Kai-shek is scheduled to go to Zhengzhou from Kaifeng on the 6th. (Special telegram of the 6th by the Tongxun Agency) (Shenyang) He Chengjun's representative, Wang Jinyu, arrived in Shenyang at 3:40 PM on the 5th. Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and others were at the station to greet him. That evening, he met with Zhang Qun and others to discuss strategies for managing the current situation with Zhang Xueliang. Wang carried Chairman Chiang's personal letter, so the meeting that evening was quite important. As a result, Zhang Xueliang may assume the position of Deputy Commander on the Double Tenth Festival. (Special telegram of the 5th by the Tongxun Agency)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Beiping, stating that the political organs in Beiping and Tianjin were informed by the representatives of Zhang and Wu of the telegram from the Central Political Conference and Chairman Chiang, entrusting Zhang Xueliang with full responsibility for all military and political affairs in the Beiping and Tianjin area. Then people were dispatched to take over the various political organs. Foreign groups say that Zhang's full authority to take over the military and political organs in Beiping and Tianjin was granted by the Central Government and was not initiated by the Northeast itself.

<h3 id="e5">Liaoning Army Takes Over Defense of Daming <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) Sun Tongxuan telegraphed the headquarters from Dezhou: The first cavalry brigade of the Liaoning Army, led by Guo, arrived at Sangyuan on the 3rd. About one regiment arrived at Sanlie on the 4th. After disembarking, led by regimental adjutant Liu Qingtian, they headed west to Daming. Sun sent staff officer Ye Cang to negotiate joint defense, and the result was satisfactory. The Sang regiment still only stationed one company. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Feng Yuxiang's Army Retreats Across the Yellow River <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang to Go to Jiaozuo</p>
<p>(Hankou) Military news: Part of Feng Yuxiang's army in Zhengzhou crossed the river towards Jingshui Town, and another part fled north along the Yellow River Bridge. Pang Bingxun and Zhang Weixi both sent representatives to Xuchang to surrender. Lu Zhonglin also advocated aligning with the Central Government and urged Feng to step down. Currently, there are about five divisions of Feng's army near Xinzheng, and about three divisions of mercenary troops north of Xuchang. Liu Zhi and others are separately receiving and reorganizing them, and surrounding them to disarm them. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xinxiang telegram: Feng personally led 30,000 men across the river and will go to Jiaozuo to set up a headquarters. Feng seems to still be at Zhongyi Station in Hebei. Liu Ji arrived in Xinxiang to see Shi Yousan and requested leave to go to Jiaozuo. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhengzhou said: Feng's failure was not due to military affairs, but because he played petty tricks at the wrong time. For example, he told Fu Zuoyi that our army had occupied Mamuji and Guide, and hoped that your army would quickly advance towards Yanzhou. In fact, Feng's army did not advance at that time. He also told Shi Zhenqing, Deng Baoshan, Liu Chunrong, and Shi Yousan about how his army was developing and hoped that all armies would work together. In fact, Feng's army was still concentrated south of Zhengzhou. Therefore, the mercenary leaders were very angry afterwards, saying that it was okay to exaggerate external propaganda, but it was not right to deceive friendly armies. Therefore, they agreed not to fight and let Feng's troops bear the brunt. Therefore, the Central Army led by Liu and Yang was able to occupy Gongluo and cut off Feng's army's retreat, inflicting heavy blows on Feng's general reserve force. Now, Pang Bingxun, who was initially the most vocal advocate of fighting in Taiyuan, was the first to submit to the Central Government. Ji's troops were originally from Gansu and listened to Ma Fuxiang's orders, which was expected. Currently, there are not many remnants of Feng's army. Last month, they sent conscription officers to various counties in central Henan, requesting 3,000 from large counties, 2,000 from medium counties, and 1,000 from small counties. Each county only used the old and weak to make up the numbers, and obtained more than 10,000 untrained soldiers, who have not yet been enlisted. The counties in central Henan paid money to avoid conscription, so the result was not many soldiers but a lot of money. Feng's troops used to have very good discipline, but this time in Henan, they were even more brutal than the mercenary bandits. The elders of central Henan can be asked. (Special telegram of the 6th) (Beiping) Ji Hongchang also telegraphed Beiping, saying that Feng deceived friendly armies and falsely reported the number of subordinates. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today's rumors from abroad say that Feng was detained by Shi's troops at a certain station in northern Henan. Special telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jingbao special dispatch: The Northwest Army withdrew from Zhengzhou at 10:00 AM on the 5th. At the same time, Xu Yongchang telegraphed from Zhengzhou, ending military operations. (Special telegram of the 6th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) The ninth train from Tianjin arrived in Jinan at 11:45 PM on the 5th. On the same day, the tenth train departed from Jinan to Tianjin. Transportation between Tianjin and Jinan has been fully restored. People from Tianjin said that one regiment of the Liaoning Army is stationed in Cangzhou, and one company is stationed in Lianzhen and Sangyuan, not interfering with road administration.

<h3 id="e19">The Trend of World Affairs <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Wherever the times go, things often originate in one place and prevail everywhere. This is what the world calls a trend. People's thoughts are often triggered by something felt and are formed by admiration. Therefore, in everything from eating and drinking to clothing, decorations, living, and housing, there is what is called fashion. Conforming to the trend is new and strange, while going against the trend is old and stale. Things used daily are like this, and so are the organization of the state and the implementation of politics. If industry and commerce are enough to prosper the country, then people flock to industry and commerce. If the parliamentary system is better than autocracy, then people flock to the parliamentary system. If the "cheering party" succeeds in Italy, then those with "cheering parties" in the world follow one after another. If the capital concentration method succeeds in the United States, then most businesses in the world concentrate capital. Moreover, to discuss the most recent facts, once a republic in South America rises in revolution, then other republics also often revolt. People's corresponding and imitating each other is inherent, without knowing why, and cannot be forced. Not only are human affairs like this, but sometimes the disasters and benefits that befall the world are also like this. It is not necessary to discuss the relationships of involvement or repercussions of great winds, great rains, great cold, great heat, and earthquakes and plagues. As for the accident of the British Airship R101, which lost many lives, and the passenger plane from Germany to Austria, which also caused the death of nine people due to an accident, these are rare events since the progress of the aviation industry in recent years, but they happened one after another, as if driven by a trend. What is the reason for this?</p>

<p>Burst Water Tank Allows Two Engineers to Escape</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th The German government has sent condolences to the British government regarding the British airship disaster. The directors of the Socialist Party have also sent condolences to the British Labour Party. Dr. Eckener, the captain of the German Graf Zeppelin airship, was shocked to hear the news of the British airship disaster in Leipzig because many of the deceased were his friends. According to Dr. Eckener and other German aviation experts, the British airship was inevitably overweight.</p>
<p>Pacific, Paris, 5th The President has sent a telegram to the King of England expressing condolences. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have separately expressed their sorrow to Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson.</p>
<p>Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 6th The British airship R-101, which exploded in the air near Paris this time, was built by the British government in October 1924 for the purpose of opening up air routes within the British Empire. It held an air launch ceremony at the Cardington Shipyard last October. On October 18th, it flew 1,000 miles in 30 hours and 35 minutes. When the ship and the R-100 were engaged in commercial aviation between Britain and India, it was further improved in the factory to increase its buoyancy. Its overall length was 780 feet, 40 feet longer than the R-100, its total weight was 170 tons, its maximum diameter was 131 feet 8 inches, its gas volume was 5 million cubic feet, and its speed was 70 miles per hour. To avoid the danger of fire, it was equipped with Grotoil engines, and the ship was filled with hydrogen gas instead of helium wood. Major Scott, who was operating the R-101, had driven the R-100 back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean and was the first operator in England. This explosion is a major event since the American airship Shenandoah disaster in September 1925.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 5th The formal investigation of the R-101 disaster will be handled jointly by British and French experts. Engineer Ridge, one of the survivors, said that when the ship encountered a strong wind in Beauvais, he happened to be in the cockpit. The ship was pitching badly and moving very slowly. He did not know the altitude at the time, but he tried his best to resist the wind. He then felt the heavy pressure of the rain, so he ordered the motors to be turned on to increase the altitude. Unexpectedly, disaster struck suddenly. The bow of the ship hit a small hilltop violently after falling twice, and the ship exploded. He was blown against the wall by the force of the explosion and tried to escape from the fire. Although he was burned, he was fortunate to escape death. Two other engineers, Pinks and Bell, also survived. It was initially thought that there was no hope of survival, but the ship's water tank broke, and the two of them happened to be under the tank, soaking all over. They were then thrown out of the ship by the force of the explosion. Because their clothes were wet, they were not burned.</p>
<p>Reuters, Beauvais, 5th It has now been ascertained that when the British airship R-101 crashed, twelve crew members were working, and the rest were sleeping. One engineer in the engine room was almost burned to ashes and was still holding measuring tools in his hand, which shows the suddenness of the ship's accident. The corpses are now properly placed in coffins. Some of the bodies have shrunk very short after being burned. The number of onlookers is gradually increasing. More than a dozen airplanes are soaring in the air, inspecting downwards. When the airship passed Beauvais, the gale roared, and the flight was very low. The sound of the engine was grinding and breaking people's dreams. Before long, the ship exploded, shaking the houses about four miles away from the scene of the accident. Then a yellow light was seen rising, which lasted for five minutes. Whether this airship was damaged first and then exploded is a question. Some structural components of the ship have now been found at a distance of two miles from the scene of the accident, which is something that should be paid attention to. According to the survivors, the airship fell and rose twice, and the speed at that time was about 55 miles per hour. Finally, it fell from a height of 1,000 feet to the ground, nose first, followed by an explosion. The whole ship was on fire. The explosive was hydrogen gas, not heavy oil fuel, because the gas pipes were all broken.</p>
<p>Reuters, Beauvais, 6th A representative of the British Aviation Department issued a formal statement saying that the cause of the R-101 airship disaster is not yet known for certain, but it is expected that the ship hit the ground first and then exploded. According to survivors, there were a total of 58 people on board when the ship left Cardington, but now, in addition to the eight survivors, only 47 bodies have been found, and the whereabouts of the remaining three are unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th The British Aviation Department stated that the number of casualties reported by Beauvais for the R-101 airship accident is inconsistent with the number announced by the British Aviation Department. The reason for this is probably that the number reported by the French is based on the reports of the survivors, and the survivors may not know exactly how many people were actually on board.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th The Chief of the Air Staff, Samaan, accompanied by the Director of Aviation Technology Development, Hoyt, flew to the scene of the R-101 airship accident this morning. Before long, another nine experts, including R-100 Captain Boots, also flew from Croydon to France to assist in gathering information about the accident. Chief of Staff Samaan and Payne, the aviation attache of the British Embassy in Paris, paid their respects to the deceased after arriving in Beauvais, but many of the bodies were so blurred that they have not yet been identified. The Aviation Department said that the Aviation Council plans to arrange a public investigation into the cause of the ship's accident, which will be held in Britain, but it must cooperate with the French government.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th It is reported that the bodies of the R-101 victims will be transported back to the United Kingdom as soon as possible and are currently displayed in the church of Arronie. At least several people can be identified today. The ship's oil tank was still burning at 9 pm last night, and the fire illuminated the surrounding area. Although the whole country is now mourning the brave martyrs of the R-101, the shock has gradually subsided. The first question in the minds of the people is whether airships lighter than air are suitable. All newspapers unanimously expressed their condolences to the martyrs who died tragically, and on the one hand, they discussed whether airships can be relied on after this disaster, and at the same time, they demanded a thorough investigation into the cause of this accident, and also considered the problem of airships heavier than air.</p>

<p>Inukai Attacks the Government's Austerity Policy Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th The Seiyukai Kanto Convention was held in Maebashi City on the afternoon of the 5th. President Inukai presented five major political programs at the meeting. Regarding financial policy, he spoke for more than an hour, stating that the economization of the military has been the party's claim for many years. The reason why our party reviewed the Washington Naval Treaty so particularly closely was to see whether the results would enhance international peace and substantially reduce the burden on the people. However, the current government, when responding to the previous parliament on the issue of command authority, asserted that it had already considered the military's claims and that the military's agreement was not required for the resolution on military strength, but in the Privy Council, it instead claimed that it had obtained the military's agreement, resulting in a deterioration of relations with the military and sowing the seeds of disaster for the future. Furthermore, it is unwilling to clearly announce the supplementary plan. It is because the government, while putting on a tough front on the surface, is actually trying to seek understanding in private, a very ugly sight. Our party resolutely opposes the expansion of armaments in the name of military reduction, so it is under serious surveillance that the London Treaty will not become a means of military expansion. Since the current cabinet was established, an unprecedented recession has invaded Japan, and bankruptcies and unemployment continue to occur. The people's suffering is unbearable. The government merely attributes it to the world's recession and does not discuss any appropriate measures to alleviate it. It believes that in order to overcome the current unfavorable situation, it is necessary to first abandon the erroneous consumption-saving and austerity policies of the Hamaguchi cabinet and establish a production-enhancing and enriching policy, that is, an unemployment countermeasure. The government is also only making local authorities responsible, which is a confusion of priorities. Our party intends to increase production and at the same time reorganize the administrative, financial, official industry, and official property, etc., that our party has been advocating for years, as well as the economization of military equipment, to be used for a tax reduction of 50 million yuan, in order to overcome this difficult situation. As for the non-debt-raising doctrine, it is not the only policy for saving the country and saving the people. Depending on the market conditions, there is no harm in issuing public bonds at times. Because in today's difficult situation, political parties must conduct thorough investigations of government affairs and implement the policies they have announced in order to complete the function of parliament.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Commemorative Week at the Central Government and the National Government <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters On October 6th, at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the 80th weekly memorial service for the late Premier in the main auditorium. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Chen Yaoyuan, and other departmental staff and guests, totaling about six to seven hundred people, attended. Chairman Ye Chucang, after commencing the ceremony, gave a report, stating that everyone was likely already aware of the current situation of the Central Party and government, as well as the victories of the anti-rebellion military campaign, so he would not repeat them. However, the central government needed to investigate the current situation of Party affairs and administration in various provinces at any time, and those responsible for the local affairs of each province also needed to report to the central government on the current situation of Party affairs and administration at any time. Jiangsu, with Nanjing as its capital, benefits from the central guidance, making the implementation of Party affairs and administration a focus of both the central government and various local authorities. He would take this opportunity to briefly report on the Party affairs and politics of Jiangsu Province. The Jiangsu Provincial Government had been established for five months. Whether the administration was clean and bright, whether local security was guaranteed, whether the burden on the people had been reduced, and whether the troubles between the Party and the administration had been eliminated could be summarized by saying that none of these had been achieved. He felt that the biggest cause of disputes between the Party and the administration was the protection of subordinates by government offices and the protection of Party members by Party departments. If local officials neglected their duties, higher-level government offices should have noticed it early and punished them according to the law. It felt less than satisfactory when punishment was only meted out after the Party department filed a complaint. If, after the complaint, not only was there no thorough investigation and handling, but there was also a feeling of discomfort, then it would be extremely difficult for both sides to get along, and how could there be any cooperation? He initially thought that by doing things with a clear conscience, some results could be achieved. However, based on the experience of the past few months, he realized that employing people and administering affairs cannot achieve the desired effects solely by relying on conscience. The corruption in handling public security in various counties of Jiangsu Province was truly indescribable. Not only was it not beneficial to the locality, but it also caused much harm to the people. Most counties experienced financial difficulties to pay the police. However, the police station inspector in these places without funds felt that it was even more to his liking, and the behind-the-scenes dealings were imaginable. Therefore, he often felt that it would be better to abolish these corrupt police agencies altogether, but the difficulty was that the regulations did not allow it. Also, for example, the construction land tax in each county had a maximum annual revenue of no more than 4,000 yuan, but the county government had to set up a construction bureau, and the salaries and public expenses of its director, technicians, and other personnel would amount to 3,600 yuan per year. With the remaining 400 yuan, how could construction be discussed? He also felt that it was unnecessary to set up a special bureau and that the county government could appoint technicians to be responsible for handling it, in order to save expenses and free up funds for construction needs, but this was also not allowed by the regulations, so he hoped that attention would be paid to this and that some flexibility would be left in the agency organizational regulations. As for the employment of personnel, it was even more difficult. He used to be not very confident in the ability of the elderly to handle affairs, fearing that they would be old-fashioned, but now he was also not very confident in the ability of young people to handle affairs. There were many excellent young people, but there were also many corrupt ones. Before having a job, they would look everywhere for work, but once they had a job, they would become discouraged and lazy due to some slight difficulties. It was extremely difficult to find truly talented people. With the higher civil service examination not yet completed, it was difficult to find standards for appointing officials. Often, when appointing a county magistrate, they would speak eloquently during the meeting, but after taking office, their performance would be the complete opposite of what they had said. The gathering of talented people was the fundamental condition for a clean administration. Without proper screening, entrusting them with power would inevitably lead to failure, so he also hoped that the policy on the employment of personnel would be determined as soon as possible in order to remedy this. There were many bandits in Jiangsu Province, and they were widespread, even more so than before May, which was truly distressing. The local security forces consisted of only one regiment, which could only cope with the bandits and fulfill the responsibility of defending the territory for the country. They could not talk about suppressing the bandits and relieving the people from their suffering. During this anti-rebellion period, Jiangsu Province was fortunate not to have experienced any major incidents, which was due to the strength of the central garrison forces in the rear, which was enough to deter them. The local forces in Jiangsu Province could not share even one-tenth of the credit. Although the Jiangsu Provincial Government had a plan to establish four security regiments, there was no timetable for its realization, so he still hoped that the central government would send heavy troops to suppress the bandits on a large scale at the end of the anti-rebellion campaign, first clearing the lurking bandits in the vicinity of the capital in order to maintain the order of Nanjing. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>National Government On the same morning at 10:00 AM, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Ruiheng, Zhu Lühe, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Li Jinlun, Mu Xiangyue, Zhu Jingnong, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Xiqian, and more than two hundred staff members from the two departments of civil officials and military advisors of the National Government attended. Chairman Gu, after performing the ceremony, heard Secretary Zhu Wenzhong give a political report as follows: In terms of military affairs, the progress in military affairs during this week has been very rapid. Since the central army bravely advanced on the 30th of last month and captured Lanfeng, which the enemy had stubbornly defended for several months, it also captured Qixian and other places on the same day. On the 1st of this month, it captured Zhuxian Town Chenliu, on the 2nd it captured Heshang Bridge Xuchang, on the 3rd it captured Kaifeng, and on the 4th it occupied Zhongmu. It is now besieging Zhengzhou and Luoyang, and it is expected that Zheng and Luo can be captured within a day or two, completely eliminating the remaining forces of the enemy on the Longhai and Pinghan railways. At this time, Feng Yuxiang already knew that his own life was coming to an end, so he created an atmosphere of resignation and going abroad, hoping to save his life. Past facts tell us that Feng Yuxiang's resignation and going abroad have been mentioned several times, but the result was still rebellion and still dreaming of overthrowing the Party and the country. Therefore, what he says now is not only not believed by bystanders, but even his own subordinates are mostly suspicious of each other. Because of mutual suspicion, everyone wants to find a proper way to survive in the future. The ancients said that those who obey Heaven will survive, and those who defy Heaven will perish. Heaven is the natural trend, which means that only by following the natural trend can one survive, and those who defy the natural trend will perish. Feng Yuxiang has repeatedly rebelled, nothing more than wanting to maintain his feudal power, or even go a step further and taste the taste of Hongxian the second and third. This erroneous thinking is completely incompatible with the modern natural trend of democracy. Based on the principle that those who obey Heaven will survive and those who defy Heaven will perish, his demise is inevitable and his survival is impossible. Therefore, his current defeat was already in our budget. This rebellion by Yan and Feng can be said to be the last glimmer of all feudal remnants. After this final suppression by the central government, we believe that there will be no possibility of a resurgence. Before setting off for the front, Chairman Chiang once said that the sooner the counter-revolution breaks out, the sooner the revolution will succeed. This sentence has actually become a reality now, and we should congratulate the Party and the country on its future. The day before yesterday (the 3rd), Chairman Chiang sent a telegram from the front, proposing that the government issue a clear order after the military situation is stabilized, or on January 1, 20, to pardon all political and military criminals, cancel the wanted notices, restore their freedom, and allow them to enjoy the rights that ordinary citizens should have, in order to appease the dissidents, stabilize people's hearts, eliminate the source of chaos, and consolidate the foundation of the country. This proposition of governing people with virtue is completely consistent with the spirit of generosity of the late Premier. Originally, using heavy punishment to govern a chaotic country was only a temporary expedient method. The fundamental plan for the long-term peace and stability of the country should naturally not exceed the two words of benevolence and love mentioned by the late Premier. After this military situation is stabilized, the government will definitely be able to follow Chairman Chiang's proposition and vigorously practice the two words of benevolence and love, in order to implement the great spirit of the late Premier's generosity and all-inclusiveness. In terms of finance, the national likin tax was originally scheduled to be abolished uniformly on October 10th of this year. The Ministry of Finance had already sent personnel to prepare and convened financial personnel from various provinces and economists to hold a meeting to discuss and plan compensation methods, hoping to implement it as scheduled. Unfortunately, after this military incident occurred, the impact affected various provinces, some of which became war zones or had bandit problems. If changes were made now, many malpractices would inevitably occur, which would be harmful and not beneficial to the country and the people. The government, in view of this, decided to postpone the implementation for two months, but it was limited to implementation before January 1, 20, and could not be delayed any further. It can be seen that the government has long been determined to abolish the national likin tax. No matter how difficult it is, it will eventually abolish it completely within this year. In terms of diplomacy, Weihaiwei was officially taken over by our country on the 1st of this month. All takeover procedures have been properly handled. The previous report on the Xiamen British Concession stated that it was recovered on the 17th of last month. On the 1st of this month, Weihaiwei was officially taken over again. Within two weeks, two concessions were recovered. The progress in diplomacy cannot be said to be slow. If we can continue to strive in this spirit, we believe that we will definitely be able to follow the late Premier's will, abolish all unequal treaties in the shortest possible time, and restore our country's inherent position in the international arena. In terms of legal system, recently, the Legislative Yuan has passed the first to fifth parts of the Civil Procedure Law, the National Funeral Law, and the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law. Among them, the most noteworthy is the National Funeral Law, which the government promulgated last Friday. The first article states that "citizens of the Republic of China who have made special contributions to the country shall be given a state funeral after their death in accordance with the provisions of this law." According to this provision, all citizens of the Republic of China, as long as they can make special contributions to the country, can enjoy the honor of a state funeral after their death. All the class characteristics in the previous laws have been completely broken. This is the equalization of laws, which is the true spirit of legislation based on the Three Principles of the People, and it is very worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Wang Shuchang of the Second Northeast Army Enters the Pass <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Accompanied by New Appointees to Various Agencies in Peiping and Tientsin Shenyang Correspondence: Wang Shuchang, the newly appointed Chairman of Hebei Province and Commander of the Second Northeast Army, set off at 1:10 PM on the 24th to enter the Pass. A special train of twenty-three cars was specially prepared by the Railway Bureau and arrived at the new station platform at 10:30 AM that morning. At the same time, personnel from the Second Army Headquarters and various personnel who were traveling on the special train to take up new positions in Peiping and Tientsin gathered successively on the platform, and well-wishers from all sides also filled the platform. A band from the Border Defense Headquarters also arrived at the station to play music to see them off. When the special train was arranged by the adjutant's office of the military headquarters and arrived at the new station from Huanggu Village Station, Zhang Xueming immediately arrived. The directors and secretaries of various departments of the Border Defense Headquarters, the chairmen of the provincial government and various provincial committees, and the leaders of various military, political, legal, and团bodies in the provincial capital all arrived at the station. Zhang Zuoxiang, the Chairman of Jilin Province, Wan Fulin, the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and Tang Yulin, the Chairman of Rehe Province, also sent representatives to the station to see them off. It is estimated that there were more than three hundred well-wishers. At 12:45 PM, Wang Shuchang arrived at the station and got off the train, first greeting the well-wishers and exchanging greetings with Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Zang Shiyi, and Wang Shuhan (Secretary-General of the Border Defense Headquarters) for a long time. He did not board the train and head west until 1:00 PM. Wu Tiecheng and Fang Benren also took a car to the new station to see him off. However, when they arrived at the station, Wang's special train had already departed. Wu and Fang then boarded the car again and chased to the old station to bid farewell. It is heard that Wang plans to arrive in Tianjin on the 2nd, organize the military headquarters, and then go to Peiping to assume the post of Chairman of the Provincial Government. However, Commander Zhang Xueliang believes that Hebei Province is burdened with many affairs, and governance is difficult. Wang Shuchang has little administrative experience, and he fears that there may be negligence after he takes office. It has been found that Liu Haiquan, the former Governor of Liaoning Province and the current member of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, has rich administrative experience, and it is proposed to appoint Liu as a senior consultant to the Hebei Provincial Government to assist Wang in handling government affairs. It should be announced soon. Liu must wait until Wang takes office as Chairman of Hebei Province before he can enter the Pass. The order of distribution of Wang's special train to Tianjin is as follows: (1) Locomotive, (2) One official car, (3) Three third-class passenger cars for provincial and municipal personnel and military headquarters luggage cars traveling to Peiping and Tianjin to take up new positions, (4) Dispatch and liaison vehicles for various troops, (5) Vehicles for provincial and municipal personnel and various attendants traveling to Peiping and Tianjin to take up new positions, (6) Vehicles for provincial and municipal personnel traveling to Peiping and Tianjin to take up new positions, (7) Vehicles for company-grade officers of the military headquarters, (8) Vehicles for field-grade officers of the military headquarters, (9) Vehicles for directors of various departments of the military headquarters, (10) Military headquarters dining car, (11) Vehicle of Army Commander Wang Shuchang, (12) Vehicle for Zhang Xueming's attendants, (13) Vehicle of Zhang Xueming, (14) Four flat cars carrying military supplies, (15) Three covered cars carrying cars, etc., (16) One lookout car. As for the infantry second, fifth, and twenty-fifth brigades under Wang Shuchang's command, which were heading to the Pass to take over the defense, they have advanced one after another. It has been decided that the Fourth Artillery Regiment and a part of the Third Regiment of the First Army will advance from the defense zone Jin County Goubangzi within the next few days. According to reliable information from the military headquarters, each unit is stationed in Junliangcheng. The communication team, baggage train, and engineering team company have departed from Goubangzi, Xinmin County, and Xingcheng County at noon on the 30th and are stationed in Tianjin. In addition, Guo Xipeng, the commander of the First Cavalry Brigade of the Northeast stationed in Tongliao, has been ordered to set off on the 30th and head to Sangyuan Station on the Jinpu Line to be stationed. The brigade is divided into three regiments, with Liu Zhonglin, the commander of the Second Regiment, originally stationed in Kailu, Ming Qing, the commander of the Fifth Regiment, originally stationed in Daodeyingzi, and Dong Wenge, the commander of the Seventh Regiment, originally stationed in Liaoyuan. On the side of Yuguan, the authorities have sent Zhang Tingchu, the commander of the 12th Infantry Brigade stationed in Jin County, and He Zhuguo, the commander of the 3rd Brigade stationed in Yixian Beipiao, to take over the defense. The movement of all county garrison troops into the Pass and the local defense are also extremely important. The authorities have formulated joint defense measures between military police to maintain local public security and issued a circular to all subordinate garrison troops, county magistrates, and public security bureau chiefs to comply with them.

<h3 id="e59">Supreme Court's Judgment on Gao Ying's Opium Trafficking Case <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Gao Liao Shi sentenced to four years of imprisonment and a fine of four thousand yuan. Nanjing Dispatch: The Supreme Court, regarding the case of appellants Gao Ying, Gao Liao Shi, Sun Yuan, and others for the crime of selling opium, etc., who appealed against the second instance judgment of the Jiangsu High Court, hereby renders the following judgment according to law:</p>
<p>Main Text: The original judgment is revoked. Gao Liao Shi, with intent to sell, possessed opium and is sentenced to four years of imprisonment, along with a fine of four thousand yuan. The number of days of pre-trial detention shall be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If the fine is converted into imprisonment, it shall be calculated at a rate of three yuan for one day, but the imprisonment period shall not exceed one year. The two cans of opium are confiscated and burned. The Gao Ying and Sun Yuan parts are sent back to the Jiangsu High Court for retrial.</p>
<p>Facts: Gao Liao Shi is the wife of Gao Ying, the vice-consul of the U.S. Consulate General in San Francisco. Gao Ying and Gao Liao Shi both reside in San Francisco and are well aware of international practice, where the luggage of consulate personnel and their families can be imported without inspection. Therefore, they took advantage of this opportunity and colluded with Chinese residents in San Francisco whose names are unknown, Shou Nan Ruo Yun, and Hong Kong merchants Wen Yu Xian and Shen Guang, etc., to return to China in January of the 18th year of the Republic of China, and went to Hong Kong to carry 2,299 cans of opium for Wen Yu Xian and Shen Guang, divided into eleven boxes. All boxes were affixed with seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and signatures from the San Francisco Consulate General, and declared as their own luggage. In June of the same year, they took the Tianyang Maru steamer to the United States. On July 5th, the ship arrived in San Francisco. At that time, the U.S. Customs had already detected the situation and immediately detained the luggage carried by Gao Liao Shi, opened the boxes for inspection, and found opium and letters entrusting the delivery of opium, etc. The U.S. court then arrested Gao Liao Shi and others and handed them over to Minister Wu stationed in the United States for extradition back to the country, where the Jiangning District Court Procurator filed a public prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: This case should be explained separately. 1. Gao Liao Shi’s part: It has been verified that Gao Liao Shi's suitcases carried from China to the United States contained 2,299 cans of opium. The boxes were affixed with seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and signatures from the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco. U.S. Customs inspectors Harris and Manager Smith searched out the aforementioned opium in her boxes and issued certificates attached to the file. Although Gao Liao Shi argued, "The boxes containing opium were entrusted by Mr. and Mrs. Chen, and I did not know what was hidden inside. They only said that someone would come to pick them up when they arrived in San Francisco," Gao Liao Shi has consistently refused to disclose Mr. Chen's address, making it doubtful whether it is true. Moreover, four letters were found in Gao Liao Shi's own box, all of which were photographed and submitted to the case. One was a letter from Wen Yu Xian and Shen Guang to Sun Yuan, which stated, "Now I hand over a foreign box to the person coming." The second was a letter from Shen Guang to Ruo Yun, which stated, "Now I hand over nine foreign boxes to Mr. Gao." The third was a letter from Yu Xian and Shen Guang to Shou Nan, which stated, "Now I hand over two foreign boxes to the person coming." The fourth was a letter from Wen Yu Xian to Sun Yuan, which stated, "Brother, please open the foreign boxes yourself and check the numbers before handing them over." These letters and the keys to the boxes storing opium were found in Gao Liao Shi's box. Harris and Smith have indeed provided separate proofs, and Gao Liao Shi also admits that there is no difference. If Gao Liao Shi did not know what was stored in the box, why were the letters sent by Wen Yu Xian, etc., stored in her own box? Why would Wen Yu Xian and Shen Guang entrust the opium, which is worth a huge amount, to Gao Liao Shi? How could Gao Liao Shi not investigate the matter and immediately regard the box as her own luggage and fill it in on the luggage list? In reference to Gao Ying's telegram to Minister Wu stating, "The boxes contain a small amount of drugs, which my wife was persuaded to bring," it is even more evident that Gao Liao Shi knew beforehand that she was carrying opium, and the matter is very obvious. Furthermore, the letter from Wen Yu Xian and Shen Guang to Shou Nan stated, "150 branches of K-character Korean ginseng, each branch costing 85 yuan, and each branch paying 10 yuan for labor. 280 branches of Chang-character Korean ginseng, each branch costing 70 yuan, and each branch paying 5 yuan for labor." It also stated, "Please telegraph back for peace and price when receiving the goods." As evidenced by the seized opium cans, there are indeed two types, K-character and Chang-character, which shows that the Korean ginseng mentioned in the letter is a euphemism for opium. The so-called labor and price refer to the original transportation fee and selling price. What is stated in the letter is a comprehensive plan prepared for sale. Reviewing Gao Liao Shi’s behavior, although it has not reached the level of selling, there is no room for argument about her intent to sell and possession of this opium. Before Gao Liao Shi sold it, she carried the opium to the United States for Wen Yu Xian, etc., which is a direct and important act of helping with possession and cannot be convicted of selling. However, the original judgment considered it as attempted assistance in selling, citing Article 6 and Article 12 of the Anti-Smoking Law and Article 44, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, which is obviously a misunderstanding and should be corrected by this court according to law. 2. Gao Ying’s part: It has been verified that the opium suitcases carried by Gao Liao Shi were affixed with seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and signatures from the San Francisco Consulate General, which the San Francisco Consulate General photographed and submitted to the case. These seals and signatures are necessary items for secretly hiding opium and avoiding inspection. Gao Ying is the vice-consul of the Consulate General, and these seals and signatures happen to be affixed to Gao Liao Shi’s suitcases. When Gao Liao Shi’s luggage was detained by U.S. Customs, Gao Ying repeatedly telegraphed Minister Wu, stating, "For the sake of preserving national dignity, it is absolutely imperative not to open and inspect." He also stated, "I implore your honorable consulate to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance and immediately telegraph the Customs to stop opening and inspecting, otherwise the consequences will be unimaginable." He and Sun Yuan went to the Customs to negotiate for exemption from inspection and release. From all these aspects, Gao Ying’s suspicion of being an accomplice is indeed significant. However, the signature of the consulate does not have a seal, and it is doubtful whether it belongs to the San Francisco Consulate and was issued by Gao Ying. Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seal is not pre-issued to each consulate for backup, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied that this is on record. Even if the seal used by Gao Liao Shi was indeed obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gao Ying is far away in the United States, and it cannot be said that he is related to Gao Ying. As for Gao Ying’s initial contact with Sun Yuan at the Customs and his subsequent telegram requesting Minister Wu to negotiate for exemption from inspection and release, his repeated attempts to cover up whether he was trying to avoid his own crime or whether he acted to protect Gao Liao Shi are worthy of investigation. The original trial did not conduct a thorough investigation and hastily convicted him, which is somewhat rash. Furthermore, Chen Yi sent repeated letters to Gao Ying, stating that there were four Chinese laborers going to the United States and asking him to help them land, promising him a generous reward. When the Chinese laborers Mei Guang, Mei Geng, Wu Zhuo, and Lu Huan arrived in the United States, it was discovered that their passports had been altered and that they had misused the name of the revoked Mexican consulate, so the Chinese laborers were sent back. Not only did Chen Yi clearly state this, but Gao Ying also admitted that there was no difference. Reviewing Chen Yi’s letter to Gao Ying, it stated, "Now there are three or four people who want to go to the United States. Can I take a diplomatic passport on behalf of my brother? Can you help them land? If so, I will reward 3,000 yuan per person, and I will take one-fourth." Another letter replying to Gao Ying stated, "Before receiving the telegram, they had already boarded, so they had to go back to Shanghai. The letter received said that the Mexican name cannot be used. Fortunately, only one person used it. I don’t know what the result will be. The money could have been 3,000, but it was changed to 2,400, and I have asked them to add 2,600." Observing these two letters, it is clear that Chen Yi sent Chinese laborers to the United States, requesting Gao Ying to help them land. Gao Ying not only did not refuse but also said that the Mexican name could not be used, instructing them on how to go to the United States. When the Chinese laborers arrived in the United States, Gao Ying falsely claimed that two of them were his personal servants and asked the Consul General to find ways to help them. Gao Ying also clearly admitted this, and Sun Yuan vividly stated how he profited from it. It is clear that Gao Ying and Chen Yi agreed on a reward to help Chinese laborers land, and the evidence is conclusive, leaving no room for argument. The original trial considered that helping Chinese laborers land was an act within the scope of consular duties, and Gao Ying, as the vice-consul, agreed on a reward for his duties, which should constitute the crime of agreeing to a bribe under Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, which is not without merit. However, Article 1, Item 1 of the Consular Officer Duty Regulations states that resident consuls general, consuls, and vice-consuls in the jurisdiction of the country where they are stationed have the duties of developing the country's commerce and comforting overseas merchants.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Whether Gao Ying’s assistance in landing the Chinese laborers Mei Guang, Mei Geng, Wu Zhuo, Lu Huan, etc., is within the scope of his duties is questionable. Although Article 8 and Article 9 of the same regulation state that consular duties are not limited to commercial matters, and the official letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the first instance stated that the consular duty is to protect overseas Chinese, so although there are no explicit regulations on arrival and assistance, such matters are also necessary if there is an actual need. However, whether Gao Ying’s assistance in landing Mei Guang, Mei Geng, Wu Zhuo, Lu Huan, etc., falls within the scope of actual necessity, in addition to the original letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whether there are other orders or events in the Ministry that can confirm that assisting Chinese laborers in landing is a type of consular duty, is worth investigating. The original trial did not conduct a detailed investigation and used only the official letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the sole basis for conviction without explaining how Gao Ying’s assistance in landing Chinese laborers fit the situation indicated in the original letter, and hastily made a judgment, which is inappropriate. The intention to appeal regarding that part is not entirely without reason. 3. Sun Yuan’s part: It has been verified that the letter from Wen Yu Xian and Shen Guang to Sun Yuan contained in Gao Liao Shi's box stated, "Now I hand over foreign boxes to the person coming, a total of nine boxes from number one to number nine, for Ruo Yun to receive. Also, two foreign boxes for Shou Nan to receive. But when you arrive, please first send the foreign boxes to Brother Ruo Yun and Brother Shou Nan according to the letter, so that the foreign boxes can be handed over. Please telegraph back for peace." In addition, Wen Yu Xian sent another letter stating, "Brother, please open the foreign boxes yourself and check boxes number two and number eleven and hand them over to Brother Shou Nan. Please give the rest to Brother Fu." The numbers are inside the box and will be seen as soon as it is opened. It can be generally seen that Sun Yuan and Wen Yu Jia have a close relationship. However, according to Sun Yuan's defense, "I do not know Yu Xian, Shen Guang, Shou Nan, or Ruo Yun, and I know nothing about Gao Liao Shi carrying opium." If this is true, how dare Wen Yu Xian and Shen Guang entrust him to deliver the opium, which is worth a huge amount? Moreover, since Wen Yu Xian, Shen Guang, etc., entrusted Gao Liao Shi to carry the opium, if they had not contacted Sun Yuan beforehand, Gao Liao Shi could have directly handed it over to Shou Nan and Ruo Yun. It is clear that the various claims presented by Sun Yuan are unreasonable. It has been verified that when Gao Liao Shi's ship arrived in San Francisco, Sun Yuan personally greeted her at the pier. When Gao Liao Shi's luggage was detained, Sun Yuan introduced Gao Ying to negotiate with Customs, which Sun Yuan himself clearly admitted. By comparing and verifying, Sun Yuan’s suspicion of committing a crime is indeed not insignificant. The original trial used this to determine the facts, which is not without merit. However, a review of the litigation records shows that Sun Yuan consistently denied conspiring with Gao Liao Shi to commit a crime, and an examination of the letters sent by Wen Yu Xian, etc., also does not provide evidence of prior conspiracy. Whether Sun Yuan conspired with Gao Liao Shi beforehand to carry opium to the United States this time, and whether his presence at the San Francisco pier and introduction of Gao Ying to negotiate with Customs can be regarded as acts of sharing responsibility for the crime should all be thoroughly investigated. The original trial did not thoroughly investigate the circumstances before and after and hastily made a judgment, which seems to be insufficient to fulfill the ability to investigate. It should all be sent back for retrial to form a credible conviction. Based on the above arguments, it should be the same as Article 409 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 410, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 2 and Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, Article 9 and Article 44, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, the latter half of Article 64, Article 55, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 4, Article 14 of the Anti-Smoking Law, and Article 413 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Bandit Atmosphere on the Border of Jiangsu and Shandong <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Rizhao County suffers devastation. Qingdao Correspondence: Rizhao County is located on the border of Shandong and Jiangsu. Residents along the eastern coast live by fishing and salt production. The northwest is mountainous, and residents rely on firewood and grazing for a living. The land is barren, the people are poor, and there has never been banditry. In recent times, although bandits are everywhere, the residents of the county are still able to live and work in peace because of its coastal location. Even if bandit alerts occur, they are only caused by local unscrupulous ruffians. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of last month, about four or five hundred bandits suddenly arrived from Yizhou and Mengyin, entrenched in the southwest of Jufeng Township in the county, killing, setting fires, and devastating dozens of villages. The Qingdao native association of the county, aware that the banditry in the county is becoming increasingly urgent, specially convened a meeting of natives today (3rd) to discuss ways to quell the banditry. It was decided to elect representatives to go to Qingdao and Jinan to request the military authorities to send troops to suppress the bandits. It is also heard that the navy has agreed to send marines to intercept nearby as soon as the provincial troops arrive, in order to eradicate them in one fell swoop. (October 3rd)</p>

<p>Water police arrest five bandits. Fan Guozhong, the first team leader of the first district of the Songjiang Water Police Provincial Public Security Team, said that the junction of Songyi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang is riddled with bandits. In recent months, he arrested three bandits, including Zhang Xiaodi, i.e., Xiao Lin, and seized four long and short guns. Later, the local area was slightly quieter. Yesterday, in Shanghai, Fangjia arrested five notorious thieves, including Yu Guixiang, Wan Ruiyun, and Chen Caiqin, the main leaders of local thievery who hid their loot. They have already confessed to more than ten cases of kidnapping and theft, such as Jiaodiao Bay. The crimes are obvious and have been sent to the Songjiang County Government for legal processing.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Arrests Corrupt District Chief: Chen Ziwen, the chief of the ninth district, was previously accused of corruption in grain distribution. The county government reported to the provincial office and ordered his immediate dismissal and retention for investigation. County Magistrate Jin, in addition to appointing Zhu Qianxian, a staff member of this government, to take temporary custody, also sent staff member Liu Meichu to the district to immediately detain him. However, when they arrived at the district, they only saw assistant clerks and other personnel. After inquiring, they learned that he had left the office on the 29th of last month and his whereabouts were unknown. After Liu returned to Songjiang to report, County Magistrate Jin, considering that the district chief's family lived in Caojing, sent political police chief Dong Futang to investigate and arrest him with a warrant.</p>

<p>Citizens Request Exemption from Provincial Road Diversion: The original route of the Zhenhu Provincial Road ran westward from the west gate of Jiading through Beishi, Waigang Town, then northward through Gelong Town, and into Taicang. Recently, the Construction Department suddenly ordered the route to be diverted south of Muduhang, directly impacting the center of Waigang Town and requiring the demolition of more than one hundred public and private houses in the town. The local citizens, upon learning of this, were alarmed and petitioned the county government and the Construction Bureau to exempt the change. It is now heard that the county bureau and the Construction Bureau have telegraphed the situation to the Construction Department, but it is not known whether they will be granted permission.</p>
<p>Refugees Escorted Out of the County: On the 3rd, more than two hundred refugees arrived in Nanxiang, a town in the county. The town's Public Security Bureau dispatched police to maintain order, and Town Mayor Fei Meishan distributed rations and ordered them to leave the county. Unexpectedly, the refugees were unwilling and fled towards Sijing. The Public Security Bureau then dispatched police to chase them down and, together with the Sijing Security Regiment, escorted them to Nanxiang Railway Station and forced them onto the train to Kunshan. It is heard that the refugees are from Huangmei County, Hubei, and had harassed Yinxian County, Zhejiang, and were escorted to Shanghai, from where the Shanghai Public Security Bureau escorted them to Jiading.</p>

<p>Market Property Tax Receipts Issued by the Bureau: The market property tax in the towns and streets of this county is used for local public patrol and police expenses. Therefore, the tax receipts issued have always been issued by the local sub-bureaus. Later, although the collection of taxes was changed to the Financial Bureau, the tax receipt format was still printed and issued in the old style, resulting in inconsistent styles and separate registration. Now, Wang Zhuofu of the Financial Bureau, in order to eliminate fraud and clarify the plan, has specially revised the procedures for collection and also issued a general order that from this month onwards, all tax receipts will be made and issued by the bureau and will have the bureau's seal stamped on the seams to show seriousness.</p>

<p>Robbery in Shishe Village: The family of Liu Rusheng, a farmer in Shishe Village, Shitang Town, Hengjing, was suddenly visited by eight or nine bandits last night. Two box cannons and iron rulers were used to first bind and injure the 70-year-old grandmother and Liu's mother. More than 300 yuan and clothing were robbed. When leaving, they also kidnapped the victim across the Lian Bridge in Shitang and threw him down only when they reached Huangyong.</p>
<p>Gong Guoliang Dismissed: Gong Guoliang, the district chief of the Third District of the Water Public Security, was dismissed yesterday (6th) by an order from the Civil Affairs Department. The vacancy was filled by Shen Weikuai (Gao Chen (from Wuxian)). After receiving the order, Gong immediately ordered the department to sort out the accumulated cases and all documents in preparation for the handover. It is heard that Shen will take over on the Double Tenth Festival after being appointed.</p>
<p>Acting Team Leaders Ordered Back: Huai Zongbang, the team leader of the Fourteenth Team of the Water Public Security stationed in Wujiang, and Du Jingwu, the team leader of the First Squad, died one after another. The district chief appointed guerrilla captain Fang Yue to act as the team leader of the Fourteenth Team, and the pioneer officer of the district headquarters, Shi Zhen, to act as the team leader of the First Squad. Yesterday, after District Chief Gong was dismissed, he immediately ordered Captain Fang and Pioneer Officer Shi to be transferred to Suzhou.

<p>Xiliang Ferries Robbed at Jiuligou: In recent years, the ferry business between Wuxi and Liyang has been very prosperous. Five companies operate daily. On the morning of the previous day, four ships departed from Liyang to Wuxi at the same time. One was Xin Jiangcheng of the Changli Line Yangxian Company, one was Guoshan, which passed through Liyang from Zhangzhu to Wuxi, and the other two were Yonggu and Zhonghua, of the Xili Line Yonggu Zhonghua Company. Xin Jiangcheng and Guoshan departed half an hour earlier than Yonggu and Zhonghua. They passed Pinquankou, a key route from Wuxi, Changzhou, and Yixing through Liyang. After passing this, they exited Jiuligou, a key point for Liyang along Taihu Lake. The area is extremely remote, with very few residents and reeds growing on both sides. While the two ships were sailing, gunshots were suddenly heard, and bullets flew past. The whole ship was terrified. At that time, five or six dozen bandits with long guns on the shore shouted for the ships to stop. The ships had no choice but to stop. Many bandits boarded the ships and robbed passengers on both ships, and no one was spared. It is estimated that a total of five or six thousand yuan was lost, and ten people with more ornate clothes were kidnapped. At this time, the Yonggu and Zhonghua, which were sailing behind, had already sailed more than half a mile away. The bandits immediately lowered the tugboat of the Xin Jiangcheng and chased directly, frequently firing shots to show off their power. The Yonggu and other two ships sped up and fled for their lives, but the bandits chasing on the shore were also forced to a small bay and could not cross it, so they were able to escape. After arriving in Xushe, they reported to the local police and security regiment to investigate and strictly investigate the whereabouts of the stolen goods and kidnappings. The Xin Jiangcheng small ferry that was driven away by the bandits has not yet returned.</p>
<p>Wuxi Silk Factories Unanimously Decide to Close Down: The Wuxi Silk Factory Trade Association convened a temporary members' meeting the other day to discuss important issues such as opposing public quantity inspections. Twenty-seven members from thirty-three factories attended, and Qian Fenghao was publicly elected as chairman. The conference situation is as follows: (1) The chairman reported that the Shanghai-Wuxi counterparts had previously decided to stop work in all factories when it was absolutely necessary due to opposition to public quantity inspections. Now the silk market is sluggish, and factory losses are even greater, and they are unable to maintain it. Most factories in Shanghai have closed down, and some workers have voluntarily reduced wages and canceled bonuses in order to reduce costs. What should the factories in Wuxi do? After discussion, it was decided that the issue of public quantity inspections has not been resolved, and silk sales are becoming increasingly stagnant. Each factory can no longer maintain it. The factories in this city decided to temporarily close down from today onwards in accordance with Shanghai's methods. Those involved in silk unwinding may close down together after the silk unwinding is finished. (2) Shanghai Yongyu Silk Factory sent a letter reporting that the Shanghai silk industry had decided to request the government to issue funds to maintain it because of excessive losses and inability to maintain it. The factories in Wuxi have the same joys and sorrows. How should they handle it? It was decided to unite with the factories in Shanghai and request the government to allocate funds for relief.</p>
<p>Cold Waterfront Port Robbed in Broad Daylight: A local mountain goods store in this city specially sent a shop assistant to hire a boat to the countryside to collect debts for the approaching old Mid-Autumn Festival. Yesterday (6th), they returned to the city. At 11:00 a.m., the boat arrived at the Lengdugang area of the Second District (Jingyun City). Unexpectedly, five bandits dressed in tattered uniforms, resembling scattered soldiers, suddenly shouted loudly and forced them to stop. Seeing that the situation was not good, the debt collection boat immediately set sail. The bandits then saw a fishing boat parked nearby and immediately jumped on board, ordering the boatman to row and chase after them. They were caught up. The bandits then swarmed aboard and robbed them at will, and took out weapons, threatening them to remain silent. After half an hour, they left the boat after a full robbery. Upon inspection, it was found that 40 yuan in debts had been robbed. At the same time, a manure boat was also passing by and was also boarded and robbed by the bandits, who only robbed them of one silver yuan.</p>

<p>Using Counterfeit Bills and Committing Opium Crimes: Xiao Lu San, who lives in Chujiawan, west of the county, asked the mother of a Chen woman, a concubine of the Shuyuan Lane, to use many counterfeit banknotes from a certain bank in a cigarette paper shop. Two of them had already been used. When using the third one, he was caught by the shop and sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. He confessed that Xiao Luo San had asked him to use them. The Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched police to arrest Luo San and also arrested an opium addict, Chen Yisheng (i.e., Chen the Monk), and immediately sent them to the county. Yesterday (4th) afternoon, the court opened the trial. The old woman confessed that Luo San asked her to use the bills on his behalf and that she did not know they were counterfeit, and asked for leniency. Xiao Luo San confessed that the three counterfeit bills were all obtained at a certain large gambling house in Shanghai. The official then asked about the opium case, and Luo San confessed without hesitation. He then interrogated Chen the Monk, who confessed that he had been smoking for 20 years. As a result, the old woman and Luo San were each fined 300 yuan, and those who could not pay were sentenced to 300 days of detention. In the opium case, Xiao Luo San was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, and Chen the Monk was sentenced to one month.</p>

<p>Telephone Price Increase Must Be Implemented: The Zhenjiang Telephone Bureau previously notified all users that it would increase the monthly fee by one yuan. The users believed that it should not be increased repeatedly and publicly requested the Chamber of Commerce to repeatedly telegraph the Ministry of Communications to dispute the matter. The Ministry acknowledged that it would be implemented from January next year. Now the Ministry believes that this case involves government orders and is not easy to change. Yesterday, it specially telegraphed the Zhenjiang Telephone Bureau to notify all users that they would still be charged from September and ordered the Chamber of Commerce to persuade all users to comply with the order.</p>
<p>Liuhe County Representatives Come to the Province to Request Troops: In recent days, banditry has been rampant in the various townships of Liuhe County. Kidnapping, extortion, arson, killing, and burning are all being carried out. Merchants and citizens are unable to sleep peacefully, and even the ripe crops in the various townships do not dare to harvest. The people are in extreme panic. Representatives were publicly elected to come to the province to meet with Chairman Ye at the provincial government to personally present all the circumstances and request that troops be sent to the county to suppress the bandits. Chairman Ye agreed to send troops for suppression in the shortest possible time. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Liuhe today.</p>
<p>Dingfengxiang Silk Factory Has a Dispute: Since the new cocoons came on the market, the Dingfengxiang Silk Factory in Zhenjiang has only worked for 57 days, with the rest of the time spent in shortage and stagnation. The female workers, because the factory has not started work for a long time, have had several labor strikes. After mediation, it was agreed that the car would be restarted at the end of the month. Now, due to the relationship between the old festivals, the female workers have asked the factory to issue the original wages and each borrow another three yuan. In order to maintain the lives of the workers, the factory agreed to the request. However, the female workers in the cocoon copying room were not given the same treatment. Therefore, the female workers in that room gathered at the entrance of the factory this morning (5th) to ask the factory owner to refuse, which led to mutual quarrels and a big dispute. It is still unknown how it will be resolved.</p>

<p>District Chief Extortion Case: Second Trial Record: The previous case of Wu Kai, the district chief of the 8th district of this county, being sued in the county government by villager Shen Dejiu and others for intimidation and extortion, was re-examined yesterday (the 3rd) at 5:00 PM. Fan, the police inspector, and Zhang Sixin were summoned to court for further questioning of the defendant, Wu Kai, and the witnesses. Neither the defendant, Wu Kai, nor the witnesses were present. According to Zhang Sixin's testimony, Wu Kai used an official letter on the 15th to borrow police officers from my station. I lent him two officers at the time. At 9:00 AM on the 16th, he sent villager Shen Dejiu to my station. At that time, I was outside having tea and was called back by my orderly. Wu Kai then said to me, "Detain villager Shen Dejiu here." That afternoon, I went to the city to attend a police affairs meeting. As for the court hearing in the countryside and the release of Shen Dejiu and others, I know nothing about it.

<p>Prisoners Compete for Increased Rations: There are a total of 140 to 150 prisoners detained in the Huaiyin County Prison and the detention center, including over 80 criminals and over 60 individuals detained for military purposes or held by the High Court branch. The prison official in charge and head of the detention center, Zhu Bao, previously, due to soaring rice prices, found that the funds allocated for prisoner rations were insufficient to cover expenses. Therefore, he added kidney beans to the prisoner's meals to reduce costs. However, recently, with the sharp drop in rice prices, the prisoners in the prison or the detention center were still being served meals with kidney beans. As a result, the prisoners rioted in the prison. For a time, outsiders were unaware of the situation. Everyone was concerned. After Acting County Magistrate Xiong Wenmin, judge Shen Shouling, and Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao Zhenhua arrived at the prison to quell the unrest, two representatives were selected from among the prisoners, Pan Bingqing and Shi Weigao, to speak to Acting County Magistrate Xiong and others. They stated that the daily ration for each prisoner was insufficient based on the amount of rice stipulated by the High Court (20 taels of rice), and kidney beans were being added, and requested that the deducted rice be returned in full to prevent the prisoners from starving. Finally, the matter was resolved when Director Zhu agreed to stop adding kidney beans to the prisoner's meals starting on the 5th, and the situation subsided.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3 id="e73">Letter from Wang Jiwu, Magistrate of Jingjiang County <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>I recently read the Jingjiang correspondence in your newspaper issue of September 29th, which contained an item about a conflict between our county magistrate and Judge Yin, and the Jiangyin correspondence in the October 4th issue, which mentioned County Magistrate Li retaining Judge Yang. Both of these are inconsistent with the facts. I now provide a summary of the events and inaccuracies below. On September 25th, our government, based on a report, apprehended a man named Xia Yilong (not Liu Yaofang) for a smoking offense. Judge Yin sentenced him to four months of imprisonment and a fine of thirty yuan. The next day, the director and deputy director of the Funds and Property Office came to the government office, requesting bail for Xia, stating that he was seriously ill. Judge Yin ordered him to pay a bail of 300 yuan. Our county magistrate believed that since Xia's original sentence was only a fine of thirty yuan, and he was now granted bail due to illness, demanding a bail ten times the amount of the fine would not only be beyond the offender's means but also provide ammunition for those who like to stir up trouble. Unexpectedly, Judge Yin had other intentions and insisted on his own opinion, speaking with a stern tone. Our county magistrate, being responsible for his duties, could not help but reprimand him slightly. Judge Yin, in a fit of anger, left for Suzhou on his own without obtaining permission from the High Court or the consent of our county magistrate. When our county magistrate went to the court, Chief Judge Lin instructed him in person that Judge Yin's actions were inappropriate and had already been reprimanded, and Yang Junying had been appointed to replace him. He also instructed our county magistrate to supervise him strictly in the future. Our county magistrate, believing that Judge Yin had already been transferred, generously let bygones be bygones and did not report his past work or the fact that he had been repeatedly accused in detail. This is the situation regarding the replacement of our county judge. As for what your newspaper reported on the 4th of this month, that disputes repeatedly arose over the distribution of fines, and that over five hundred citizens of the county, including Jiang Huanmin, accused our county magistrate of embezzling over 50,000 yuan in public funds, all public funds in Jingyi are managed by specialized agencies. Our county magistrate has never handled a single penny other than for supervision. If the reference is to fines from smoking cases, since our county magistrate took office, the total has been no more than 10,000 yuan. After purchasing stamps in accordance with regulations, the remainder has been used as rewards for informants and those who assisted in the capture of offenders, such as the Public Security Bureau, the legal department, and the police, in accordance with regulations. Monthly reports are submitted to the court and the Civil Affairs Department and published in the county government gazette. There have never been any disputes, let alone embezzlement. A thorough search has revealed that there is no such person as Jiang Huanmin in Jingyi. This must be the work of someone harboring private grudges. Once we receive instructions from the court, we will submit a request to investigate the matter strictly in accordance with the law. Fearing that false information will be spread and confuse listeners, I am writing this letter to request a prompt correction. Sincerely, Wang Jiwu, Magistrate of Jingjiang County, October 5th.</p>
<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Past and Present of the Rural Normal School System <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>However, those following the instructions of the University Council in August of the 17th year are temporarily allowed to continue as before. The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, stated that the student admission qualifications and length of study specified in the resolution plan of the Second National Education Conference differ from the normal school system promulgated by the former University Council. It requested separate verification and instructions to be followed. The report stated briefly that the former University Council promulgated the normal school system and ordered its affiliated institutions to comply, limiting the establishment of one rural normal school in each area before August of the 18th year, which is on file. In May of this year, the Ministry ordered that rural normal classes should be operated in accordance with the resolutions of the Second National Education Conference, namely (rural normal schools enroll three types of students: (1) graduates of junior high school receive three years of training, (2) those with a high school education and an age of 15 or older receive six years of training, (3) those who are currently rural elementary school teachers and have an equivalent level of education to junior high school receive three years of training. The Ministry also ordered that two-year and three-year rural normal classes run by provincial normal schools should be operated with reference to the plan for establishing various teacher training institutions passed by this National Education Conference. It is noted that the methods for enrolling students and the length of study listed in the plan for establishing various teacher training institutions passed by the Second National Education Conference differ from the normal school system promulgated by the former University Council. However, the resolution plan of the Second National Education Conference has not yet been formally promulgated, and the normal school system established by the former University Council has not been explicitly abolished. Currently, rural normal schools in various regions that are operating in accordance with the previous system should not be ordered to change to the methods specified in the plan. All students in each school who have completed their studies and passed the examination should be allowed to graduate as before. As for students enrolled in the 18th academic year, who have completed one academic year, how should their admission qualifications and length of study be specified? It is appropriate to submit a request for verification and compliance. Furthermore, the length of study for rural normal schools specified in the resolution plan of the Second National Education Conference is six years for those entering after graduating from elementary school and three years for those entering after graduating from junior high school, which is the same as the length of study for the senior high school normal科 of normal schools. Considering the situation, students taking the examination are more likely to enter normal schools and the senior high school normal科 rather than rural normal schools. If the methods specified in the plan are followed, it is feared that it will not be possible to promote them without hindrance. Should the enrollment of students and the length of study for rural normal schools in the 19th academic year still follow the previous system, or should they be changed to operate in accordance with the plan? It is requested that a unified decision be made. The Ministry of Education instructed that the report be acknowledged. Students in rural normal classes enrolled by middle schools and normal schools in the province, whose admission qualifications and length of study are in accordance with Instruction No. 539 of the former University Council in August of the 17th year, are temporarily allowed to continue to operate as before until the new system is promulgated.</p>

<p>Eleven New Committee Members Appointed</p>
<p>Plans for Careful Management and Expansion</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northeast Three Provinces Museum is located at the former site of the Shenyang Imperial Palace. Initially, the provincial authorities appointed Chou Yuting as the director to prepare for everything. When 文选主 served as the head of Liaoning Province, he appointed seven members of the preparatory committee, with Jin Liang as the chairman, to assist in the preparations. Over the past two or three years, the artifacts stored in the Forbidden City have been displayed and opened to the public, achieving considerable success. Recently, Provincial Chairman 　Shy Shi-yi believed that the museum was of great importance to the old culture of the three northeastern provinces and should be vigorously expanded to facilitate development. Furthermore, since the museum's preparatory period had passed, it should be officially opened. Therefore, the provincial government separately stipulated the museum's regulations, implemented a committee system, and appointed eleven new committee members. The committee consists of one chairman and two standing committee members, who are responsible for the museum's affairs. As for the museum's facilities, in addition to the old artifacts, hundreds of types of old palace-collected woodblock-printed books and old Manchu archives have been completely organized, displayed, and opened for reading. Therefore, the museum's affairs are divided into two departments: artifacts and books. Recently, the provincial government has appointed the new committee members. The chairman is still Jin Liang. The committee members include Wu Jiaxiang, the director of the Department of Education; Mu Yuanzhi, the provincial government counselor; Chou Yuting, the former director of the museum; Zhao Jingqi, the former director of the Department of Administration; Dai Yuhuang, the former director of the Weights and Measures Bureau; Ji Zhenduo, the current president of the Education Association; Wang Huayi; Li Xianggeng, the secretary of the chief executive's office; Bian Hongru, the director of the provincial library; and Jin Kuijun, a famous scholar in Shenyang. Jin Kuijun has been appointed as the standing committee member of the Artifacts Department, and Bian Hongru has been appointed as the standing committee member of the Books Department. Yesterday, the committee members held their first meeting to discuss and formulate plans for organizing and expanding the museum. Each committee member is responsible for planning and implementing the plans separately.</p>

<h3 id="e87">North China Games <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Postponement Possible Due to Cold Weather: Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang, attaching importance to the North China Games, recently appointed Liu Fengzhu and others as members of the committee to prepare for the North China Games to be held in Liaoning. At 4:00 PM on September 30th, the preparatory committee members held a meeting at the Xinggong Education Association to discuss the arrangements. Those present were Wu Jiaxiang, Liu Fengzhu, Feng Yong, Sun Guofeng, Wang Zhaochu, Yao Jinsheng, Wang Huayi, Wang Zhuoran, Hao Gengsheng, Li Mengxing, Yan Yuheng, Chen Liyang, Li Shutang, and Li Jingcheng, totaling fourteen people. First, Wu Jiaxiang proposed that the North China Games should cooperate with the First Northeast Four Provinces Joint Games, but due to the cold weather and time constraints, it was not possible to hold them separately. Then, Wang Zhuoran proposed that this North China Games be suspended due to insufficient preparation time. Then, Wang Huayi proposed that the North China Games be added to the Northeast Joint Games and that the provinces be notified to participate. Those who have participated in the National Games can join the senior division. Then, Feng Yong proposed that due to the cold weather, accommodation, and curriculum issues, it could be considered to hold them in two phases. Then, Liu Fengzhu proposed that the name be changed to the Northeast Four Provinces Sponsored North China Games. Then, Yao Jinsheng proposed that the education departments of the North China provinces be telegraphed to instruct the schools to join the First Northeast Four Provinces Joint Games. The above proposals were discussed by the committee members due to time and type constraints, and five measures were formulated to request instructions from Zhang Xueliang: (1) The North China Games should be postponed due to the cold weather, short time, and lack of preparations, such as if the two sports meetings in the Northeast and North China are held together, it will delay the students' curriculum too much, it is best to postpone the North China Games. (2) If two meetings are held, the name is difficult to determine and disputes are likely to arise. Even if both parties negotiate, it is not possible to resolve it in a short period of time. (3) If the meeting is postponed for a week, it is feared that the education in the provinces will not be able to notify the schools in time, and the athletes have already set off. (4) If the superiors must order the holding of the China Games, the Northeast Joint Games will send a letter to Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, inviting them to join the performance. (5) If the Northeast Joint Games are held first and the China Games are held a week later, it will greatly affect the students' studies and be economically difficult. The above five measures were recommended by the committee members to Feng Yong, Wu Jiaxiang, and Wang Huayi to meet Zhang Xueliang at 8:00 PM that night to request instructions on how to proceed.</p>

In the Junior Group, there are Guaner, Shiguang, Ertong, Qunshi, and Suiguang, totaling five teams. Originally, the registration deadline was set for the 5th of the month, after which the order would be determined, and notices would be sent to each team to begin the competition. However, due to the National Day celebrations and the field being used for a grand rally, and the sports event being held on the 19th, the start of the competition would be frequently interrupted, which would inevitably undermine morale. Therefore, it is proposed to start the competition after the sports event. The registration deadline will also be extended to the 14th of this month to increase the number of participating teams and make the competition more interesting. It is hoped that small football teams, especially in the Junior and Athlete Groups, will enthusiastically participate.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Shanghai Third National Goods Movement Fair <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held at 2 PM Today</p>
<p>Fashion Exhibition on the 9th</p>
<p>Preparations for the Shanghai Third National Goods Movement Fair:</p>
<p>As reported in previous newspapers, the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 2 PM today at the National Goods United Department Store on Nanjing Road (formerly the site of the Municipal Government). The association has notified all sectors in advance to enthusiastically participate and contribute to the grand event. This fair is expected to be more enthusiastic than the previous two, with a superior location, many guests, shocking and inspiring displays, and excellent entertainment performances scheduled daily.</p>
<p>Value of Foreign Goods Imported (Customs Taels) Import Surplus (Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 16 (One year before the National Goods Movement Fair in this city) 1,128,405,829  105,060,526</p>

<p>This clearly tells us that the value of imported foreign goods has been increasing in recent years. Let's further analyze what these large quantities of foreign goods are:</p>

<p>Comparing Years 17 and 18, imports increased for cotton goods, cotton, flour, chemicals, metals, minerals, machinery, lumber, synthetic indigo, dyes, and colors. Imports decreased for wool fabrics, silk fabrics, kerosene, candles, coal, meat products, tobacco, and cigarettes. This shows that our country's industry is progressing in an orderly manner, hence the increased imports of machinery, metals, lumber, indigo, and dyes, with machinery being particularly prominent. However, cotton and flour still heavily rely on foreign countries, and cotton imports remain above 200 million yuan annually, which is cause for some pessimism. The sharp decrease in imports of tobacco leaves, cigarettes, meat products, wool fabrics, and silk fabrics, especially silk fabrics, indicates that the Chinese people are living more rationally, which can be attributed to the National Goods Movement. We should continue to work hard to promote and advance the movement. We do not necessarily hope for a complete shift from import surplus to export surplus, but we hope that daily necessities and items that we already produce will no longer rely on imports. For example, replacing the 200 million yuan worth of imported foreign cloth with domestically produced cotton or silk fabrics is a deep hope for the near future. Performances will be held to add to the enjoyment, and famous people will give speeches to awaken the public. In addition, the National Goods Fashion Exhibition at the Dahua Hotel on the 9th is an unprecedented event in Shanghai. Many socialites are enthusiastically participating, and there will be a men's fashion show to enhance the event. During the preparation period, the association collected many contemporary writings and compiled a fair publication, which is bound into a volume, beautifully printed, rich in content, and of great research value. It will also be distributed to guests at the venue today. Details of each aspect are listed below:</p>
<p>Fair Declaration: Time does not stay, years pass like water. The Shanghai National Goods Movement Fair is now in its third session. Looking back over the past three years, the call to promote national goods has spread throughout the country, which is gratifying to those who participate in this event. However, in reality, no one can give a definitive answer to the questions of how much the production of national goods has increased and by how much the consumption of national goods has expanded. A review of customs trade registers reveals evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Net Value of Imported Foreign Goods (Customs Taels) Import Surplus (Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Today's National Goods Movement has even greater significance. Since the trend of expensive gold and cheap silver, the world economic situation has formed two trends. Countries using gold, especially those with developed industries, face fears of commercial decline and increased unemployment, and are urgently seeking to develop foreign markets to save their domestic crises. Countries using silver, especially those with nascent industries, suffer from rising prices and the hardship of living, and must be diligent and thrifty, develop their industries, and maintain a balance of foreign trade to survive. Today, among the silver-using countries in the world, who else but our country, with its vast territory and large population, can be exploited by capitalism? The so-called Far East Economic Survey Group is expected to arrive in droves, and the surplus goods of England, America, and Japan will compete fiercely in our country's market. If people are planning against us so thoroughly, then how should we plan for ourselves? In the past six months, the sharp fall in the price of silver has caused drastic changes in the national economy. Alarming words have arisen like bees, causing panic and astonishment. The people's concern and the government's dedication have never been greater. From top to bottom, we are united in seeking to restore the price of silver. Although there are different opinions and plans, repeated debates, and irresolvable questions, one point is unanimously agreed upon: to save on the waste of life in order to increase the happiness of individuals and society. In other words, to use national goods and reject luxury in order to develop our country's industry. All obstacles to the elimination and development of industry, such as the complete abolition of transit taxes, convenient transportation, and labor-management cooperation, are being formulated and gradually implemented by the central government's competent departments. The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association was also established in Shanghai at this time and will seek to rationalize the industry in terms of production technology and organization, in order to supply the market with a large quantity of inexpensive and high-quality goods, and increase the standard of living for the people. However, this matter is of great importance and requires the cooperation of the entire society. So, where does cooperation come from? Mr. He Jingzhi, in his speech on the frugality movement at the Central Party Headquarters on February 3 of this year, said, "...Developing industry cannot be achieved in a short time, so now we can only adopt passive methods to resist, and frugality is the only practical and effective method. All imported luxury goods should be rejected, and daily necessities that can be saved should be saved as much as possible. If there are national goods that can be substituted, then national goods must be used. In this way, the sales of foreign goods in China will be blocked, and imperialism will inevitably be greatly hit." His words are simple and easy to implement, and the great cause of saving the country lies within them. The association held its first meeting in July of the seventeenth year and declared to control waste and increase production, and called for economic hardship and a national salvation movement. Today, the crisis is a hundred times greater than it was the year before. Fellow patriots, repeat Mr. He's words, practice them diligently, and make them known to every household. Parents encourage their children, siblings, sisters-in-law, and daughters-in-law encourage each other, never forgetting them. Difficulty can revitalize the country. This is a golden opportunity to eliminate economic aggression and develop domestic industry, which will be fleeting and regrettable. The rise and fall of the country depend on this one move. As the third National Goods Movement Fair opens in this city, I offer a few words to the people:</p>
<p>Inscriptions by Celebrities: "The Shanghai Municipal Government will hold the Third National Goods Movement Week and the National Goods Fashion Fair at the same time during the Nineteenth National Day, and will issue a special publication, seeking words from me. I believe that Shanghai is a major trading port in our country, with railways and roads converging, and scholars and women gathering. The temporary habits are related to the views and hearings of all directions. Now, in the midst of promoting national goods, a fashion exhibition will be held. There is a saying that, 'The city likes high buns, and all directions are one foot high. The city likes high eyebrows, and all directions are half an inch high.' It will be seen that the tools for dressing and the items for decoration do not value foreign objects, but compete to admire national products. Changing customs, the country will follow, which is not difficult to predict at this meeting. Therefore, I will write a few words to express my praise, 'In the suburbs of Shanghai, bustling with activity, this grand event is a national glory. Collecting the best, displaying the finest, using it as a model, and collecting fashion widely, establishing a reputation, broadcasting it far and wide, the grand plan is covered, the people are prosperous and healthy, the duties are to benefit, and the expectations are great, the words are to celebrate, and Meng Jin is boundless, October of the Nineteenth Year, Kong Xiangxi.'" "Chinese national products, surpass the world, study and improve, and develop this plan. To save the rights and interests, the key lies in self-reliance. Promote and guide, awaken the masses, Fang Jiaobo wrote." "If the skin does not exist, where will the hair be attached? If the country is not strong, who will protect the home? How can people compete to admire strange things, without knowing the foundation of prosperity? Therefore, to love national goods is to love the country. Alas, do not be mistaken again, Lin Kanghou wrote."</p>

<h3 id="e98">Wang Jiazhen Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>A section official will temporarily remain in Weihai.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is scheduled to depart for the capital by train this morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jiazhen, the Permanent Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was appointed as the commissioner for the reception of Weihaiwei, departed from Shanghai on the 27th of last month to Weihai to handle the reception matters. Having completed the task, he returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon aboard the Dalian Maru, accompanied by his staff, including Guang Lin and Cui Cunlin. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at around 3:00 PM yesterday, but due to the sudden death of a passenger onboard, customs inspection at the entrance of Wusong delayed its arrival until around 4:00 PM. A reporter from the New Sound Society visited Mr. Wang at his residence on Route Massenet last night, and the following is a record of Mr. Wang's remarks:</p>
<p>Reception Process: The port of Weihai was received on the morning of the 1st. All properties in the area, as well as customs, salt affairs, judicial, postal, and telegraph services, have been completely received. I have separately handed them over to the receiving personnel dispatched by the respective responsible authorities to Weihai. The British Minister to Weihaiwei, Johnston, and the British Navy stationed on Liu Gong Island, all departed from the port on the afternoon of the 2nd. Due to the complexity of various affairs, Zhu Shiquan, Assistant of the European and American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and section chiefs Ge Zukong and Fang Zobao, will temporarily remain in Weihai for ten days to assist Commissioner Xu Zushan in handling all matters.</p>
<p>British Municipal Administration: Weihai port has been leased to Britain for thirty-two years, covering an area of 2.81 million square feet, with a population of about 300,000. Through the British's determined management, the municipal administration is quite impressive. All buildings and land in the port are free from dilapidation and uncleanliness. The residents are plainly dressed, not flaunting wealth or luxury, nor are there any raggedly dressed people. The people live and work in peace and contentment, and there are very few lawsuits. Even when they meet in court, it is not difficult to resolve matters. There is a saying in the port, "The plaintiff summons the defendant, and the defendant will surely arrive." Inquiring about the facts, it is indeed true. In the event of a lawsuit, the judge first hears the plaintiff and then delivers the summons to the plaintiff to be served on the defendant. The defendant can appear in court on time. Furthermore, there are no weak horses in Weihai port, and horse-drawn carriages are not allowed to carry more than three people. Whenever a weak horse is found, the police immediately take it into custody and feed it for a period of ten days to fatten it up. The original owner then pays five jiao per day and takes it away. If it is not claimed within the deadline, the horse is sold at auction. The proceeds from the auction, minus the five yuan for the ten days of expenses, are still given to the owner. Chickens and ducks are never carried upside down; they must be held under the arm when entering the market. The municipal administration in the past was like this, so the residents are all grateful to Johnston. They are naive and lack a national concept, which is also due to their direct experience in life.</p>

<p>Weihai People's Petition: The British originally established a customs office in Weihai port, and all imports and exports were taxed at a rate of one percent of their value. Therefore, merchants cleverly transported goods from nearby areas, such as peanuts produced in Shandong, to be exported through the port. Since the reception, the Inspector General of Customs has dispatched a customs officer to the port, along with the customs supervisor from the Ministry of Finance. On the 2nd, they posted a notice dated the 29th of last month to investigate the inventory of the entire port. The citizens then elected representatives to petition me, requesting that Weihai port be opened as a tax-free port like Zhongshan Port. I explained that tax collection is uniform nationwide. Zhongshan Port differs slightly from other places because of its competitive relationship with Hong Kong, and Huludao because of Dalian. Weihai is near Qingdao and Yantai, which are operated by Chinese, so it cannot favor one over the other. If the tax</p>
<p>rate is gradually increased by one level, I can convey this to the central government on their behalf. The citizens were satisfied.</p>
<p>On Liu Gong Island: Liu Gong Island is where Ding Jingshan, the naval admiral of the late Qing Dynasty, died for his country. Therefore, there are still many relics from that time. However, after the British operated it, they also invested in acquiring the land for public ownership, and it has become a paradise. In the future, during the hot season, the British and British troops will still be allowed to take refuge there. Institutions such as the British Naval Club, hospitals, and hotels are still operated by the British.</p>
<p>A Ship Stays in Weihai: The dispatch of warships to Weihai port was originally out of concern that disturbances might occur during the takeover or interference with municipal affairs. Therefore, warships were sent to the area to provide a deterrent. Currently, Hai Chen has carried me back to Qingdao. Zhen Hai and a part of the Marine Corps are still stationed in Weihai, and the order is very good. I am scheduled to return to the capital tomorrow morning (that is, this morning) to report my mission, he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Hu Ruoyu, the Mayor of Qingdao, set off for Qingdao on the Fengtian Maru at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 5th) at the Whangpoo Wharf.

<h3 id="e100">Telegram of Victory Received by the Garrison Department <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Commander Xiong of Shanghai, for your information, our army has occupied Kaifeng, Jiang Yin respectfully informs you.</p>
<p>(Omissions) Our army began a general offensive against the rebellious enemy on the 5th of last month. The rebel Feng mobilized the main force and deployed it in the areas of Xuchang, Xinzheng, Changge, Zhengzhou, Rongyang, Mixian, Yuxian, and Luoyang, constructing solid fortifications to stubbornly resist. Our army, due to the courageous advance of the various subordinate columns, broke through the dangers and penetrated deeply. After more than ten days of fierce fighting, it had reached the vicinity of Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Rongyang, and Longmen Street south of Luoyang. The rebel enemy still relied on the fortresses, hoping to defend to the death. The morale of our various columns was a hundredfold, and the attack became even more urgent. According to reports, our troops on the railway front had defeated the troops of Tian Jinkai and Zhang Weixi on the morning of the Eastern date and occupied Xuchang. Approximately 40,000 troops under Song Tiancai and Jiao Wendian have surrendered one after another. Our army also captured a part of the rebel enemy's battalion of pistol teams, over a thousand rifles, and over a hundred pistols. Our Third Column has occupied the villages and fortresses seven or eight miles west of Zhengzhou, and the Fourth Column has occupied the area north of Rongyang Station. Our Fifth Column occupied Xicaodian on the Jiant day, and on the Eastern date, it occupied Baimasi east of Luoyang and Longmen Street south of Luoyang. The vanguard reached the vicinity of the western palace of Luoyang. The railway east of Luoyang was destroyed by us, and we are currently besieging Luoyang, which can be taken soon. Our Sixth Column is intercepting the defeated enemy to the north. At the same time, our Ninth Column occupied the areas of Caomiao, Maxuedian, and Mengzhuang, destroying the railway between Zhengzhou and Xinzheng. Our Second Column also occupied the areas of Changge and Heshangqiao, intercepting the return route and capturing two armored vehicles of the enemy. All columns have killed countless enemies one after another and captured many prisoners. It has been found that this battle was extremely fierce, lasting for ten days. Although the rebel enemy set up defenses at every step, resisting with all their might and holding on to the fortresses, they were eventually encircled and bravely defeated by our army. After this major blow, their hearts were filled with fear, and those who surrendered with weapons were still coming in an endless stream. At this moment, our various columns are still fiercely attacking Zheng and Luo, and the remaining enemies in Henan will be completely eliminated soon. I am submitting this report in advance. Liu Zhi, winter day.</p>
<p>Urgent, Commander Xiong of Longhua, for your information, I have received a telegram from Wu Cheng, the commander of the first district of my department, stating: "(1) According to reports from Battalion Commander Li Jingshan and Team Leader Fan Gongchun, on the dawn of the third day, we led our troops to Longtingkou and launched a fierce attack. The bandit forces were unable to withstand it and fled to Xiaosu Village to resist. After our severe suppression, 37 bandits were killed on the spot, 11 were wounded or killed, 3 rifles and 2 pistols were captured, and 21 hostages were rescued. The remaining bandits fled north, and Team Leader is currently leading his troops to pursue them." "(2) According to reports from Regiment Leader Ji, the bandits who fled to Matou Mountain were severely suppressed by us and fled south again. I went to Bantaji on the Eastern date to pursue and suppress them." I am reporting these circumstances to you. In addition to ordering the commander to separately order the troops to continue tracking down and searching for the remaining bandits to eliminate them completely, I am submitting this report to you. Wei Lihuang respectfully informs you, Zhi Shen Yin.</p>
<p>Urgent, Commander Xiong of Longhua, for your information, I have repeatedly received telegrams from Zhang Haizhou, the magistrate of Sixian County, and various public organizations and agencies, stating that the bandit forces in Zhao Zhuang of the county are rampant and the county seat is in danger. In addition to telegramming Commander Wu Cheng to send troops to suppress them overnight, my department has also dispatched Battalion Commander Wang Shuming of the Special Service Battalion to lead the entire battalion and two platoons of machine guns to severely suppress them. After they left, I received a winter telegram from Battalion Commander Wang Shuming, stating that he led his troops to Wangxu in the northeast of Sicheng on the Eastern date afternoon and consulted with Magistrate Zhang on the plan for suppression. At 6:00 AM on the winter day, they departed from Wangxu and raided villages such as Hanxu and Zhaoxu. After about half an hour of fighting, the bandit forces were unable to withstand it and began to retreat to Guirenji in Su Su. They retreated for more than ten miles to the border of Su when it was too late to pursue them. In addition to ordering the battalion commander to strictly arrest the remaining bandits and eliminate them completely, I am reporting to you. Wei Lihuang respectfully informs you, Zhi Wu Yin.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Continuing Efforts in Anti-Drug Week <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Strengthening the Race and Enriching the Country...Must First Reject Drugs</p>
<p>Today and yesterday are the last two days of the 7th National Anti-Drug Campaign Week. The situation is even more enthusiastic than before. Reports from provinces, cities, and counties across the country indicate that many people are actively participating in the movement. For example, in over four hundred places such as Changhua, Xiaoshan, Danyang, Changzhou, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Huzhou, Taixian, Ningbo, Nantian, Yixing, Chongde, Jiashan, Shanwu, Dinghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, etc., in each city and county, the number of participating people often reaches several thousands. Detailed information about the enthusiastic activities in various places has been published in local newspapers, which shows the firm determination of our people to reject drugs. The situation of the past two days is summarized as follows: (1) Methods for Strengthening the Race Day A. Significance: In this era of the survival of the fittest, the survival of a race is determined by its prosperity or decline. The suffering of our country from opium poisoning is obvious and outrageous. The reason why our race is poor and weak today, and why we cannot ensure our survival from morning till night, is none other than the harm of opium. Therefore, if we want to revitalize the race, restore our original vigor, and strive to reject drugs, it is an urgent plan. B. Purpose: Anti-Drug Strengthening Race Day is to awaken compatriots to work hard to eliminate opium and narcotic drugs. Its purpose can be divided into three types: (A) To eliminate the planting, selling, and smoking of opium in the country; (B) To prevent the smuggling and sale of foreign opium and narcotic drugs; (C) To abolish the opium monopoly system specifically targeting overseas Chinese by colonial governments in Southeast Asia. C. Methods (1) Conduct a survey of narcotic drugs; (2) Publicize the tragic situation of international drug disasters in China; (3) Recruit individual members; (4) Organize anti-drug propaganda meetings; (5) Expose the opium monopoly policy of colonial governments in Southeast Asia that harms overseas Chinese; (6) Hold a grand anti-drug oath ceremony.</p>
<p>(2) Outline for Strengthening the Race Day Propaganda In recent years, our country's diplomacy has failed, internal affairs have not been properly managed, the national system is poor and weak, and people's lives are impoverished. The root cause is the spread of opium addiction, which is getting worse every day. If we continue like this without seeking remedies, it will inevitably lead to national subjugation and racial extinction. Since the opening of the sea ban, European, Near Eastern, and Japanese countries have continuously imported opium and all kinds of narcotics into our country, carrying out a planned invasion movement in the hope of achieving their goal of destroying our country and our race. Some people in our country are aware of their intentions, but without the support of the masses, their abilities are weak, and they cannot resist this aggressive force. Huang Juezi, a pioneer in rejecting drugs, submitted a memorial discussing the evils of opium, saying: "First, use the useful wealth of China to fill the endless ravines overseas; use this harmful thing to gradually become a national worry. Day after day, I don't know when it will end. Upon investigation, opium smoke is made in England, which strictly prohibits its own people from eating it, and specializes in enticing people from other countries to make them weak. They have already used this to take Ge Liuba, and now they want to entice Annam. Annam strictly prohibits it and it has finally been eliminated. Now it is spreading in China, estimating human figures, ruining people's wills, and losing people's wealth. It is a great disaster that has never been seen in the history of living beings. Its disaster is more severe than floods and wild beasts." His words are poignant and awaken people. The past poison of opium is a fact that exists. Now, let's add one or two more for our reference. The recent excessive manufacture of narcotics exceeds the use of medical drugs by thousands of times. According to the report of the British representative Mr. Malcolm at the International League's Opium Committee last spring, a certain Dutch pharmaceutical factory in Liaofa manufactured 955 kilograms of morphine, 3,040 kilograms of heroin, and 90 kilograms of cocaine, while the amount transported into our country was as much as 760 kilograms of morphine, 1,316 kilograms of heroin, and 40 kilograms of cocaine. This large amount of medicine is enough to poison more than 10 million people. A small fact can prove the fierceness of the drug disaster. There are currently more than 130 factories in the world that manufacture narcotic drugs, engaging in large-scale production to meet the needs of the Eastern market. The opium addiction in the country has already had a significant impact on national health. Can we tolerate the fact that in the Northeast and the Yellow River basin, foreigners are still engaged in drug trafficking? At present, the masses are being ravaged by drugs and are on the verge of death. The number is alarming. This is indeed a major problem facing our nation and cannot be ignored. Everyone knows that opium and narcotic drugs harm the human body, but without careful investigation and research, we will never know the extent of the harm. According to Dr. Du Congming, smokers shorten their lifespan by an average of 20 years. Most medical experts have proven that morphine addicts can die in 105 years, and heroin addicts can die in two years. Now the drug disaster is spreading and intensifying, and addicts are all over the country. How can the nation not be weakened? Colonial governments in Southeast Asia take aggressive measures against Chinese people. They strictly prohibit people of other races from smoking opium, and their purpose is not only in taxation. If we study it slightly, we can know that behind this aggressive action, there is actually a conspiracy to exterminate the race, which must be paid attention to. According to accurate statistics, in the British Malay Archipelago (including the Straits Settlements and the Malay Federation), at least 20% of overseas Chinese are addicted to opium. That is, among the 2 million overseas Chinese, 400,000 are addicted. The most affected are the working class. Most of the Chinese workers in the factories smoke opium. Similar phenomena also exist in the Dutch East Indies. The situation is more tragic than this. Most of the overseas Chinese only become addicted to opium after going to Southeast Asia. Those who bring it from China account for only two or three tenths. This fact was clearly announced by the Malay Government Opium Committee, and its authenticity is known. However, the British government, on the one hand, allows overseas Chinese to smoke opium, and on the other hand, prevents indigenous and European and American people from enjoying this right. There is nothing stranger than this. The British Malay government and the Dutch East Indies government both have clear orders prohibiting other people from buying opium except for Chinese people. What is the intention? According to the opinion of a representative at the Malay Opium Committee meeting (1923-1924), opium can poison other races, but if used in appropriate amounts, it will not poison Chinese people. According to medical experts related to the British government, opium is a good medicine for preventing and treating malaria and can prolong human life. This kind of specious and absurd argument is not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. We must know that the governments of various Southeast Asian colonies only allow Chinese people to smoke opium. Their purpose is not only in taxation, but also contains a conspiracy to exterminate the race. The facts are obvious and cannot be concealed. If we want to strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the race. If we want to strengthen the race, we must first get rid of this poisonous substance that exterminates the race. The goals of today's movement are: (1) Rejecting longevity to strengthen personal physique is the fundamental key. A race is formed by gathering individuals. Only when everyone is healthy can we create a completely healthy nation. (2) Rejecting drugs is to increase the health of people in society. A healthy society can move upward and not degenerate. (3) Rejecting drugs is to improve the ability of the nation to survive and struggle, so as not to be eliminated by nature. (4) Rejecting drugs is to eliminate all evil customs that harm the body and corrupt morals, and to protect the nation so that it can have the virtue of strength and health. (5) Rejecting drugs is to increase the production of materials and nature, so as to increase the food necessary for national health. (6) Rejecting drugs is to eliminate all obstacles that hinder national health.</p>
<p>(3) Holding Anti-Drug Speeches during Commemoration Week Yesterday was the day when various agencies and organizations held Commemoration Week. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association had requested the Municipal Party Headquarters to notify party headquarters at all levels to add anti-drug speeches and oaths during the Commemoration Week. The association specially distributed various publicity materials to party headquarters at all levels in the city for use in the event. The association also directly distributed the materials to various administrative agencies and organizations and requested them to handle the matter.</p>
<p>(4) Petitioning the Government to Issue a General Order for Annual Routine Anti-Drug Week The National Anti-Drug Campaign Week has been held in various places for seven sessions. In the first three sessions, it was purely a separate movement of the masses. In the latter four sessions, most local government agencies participated one after another, especially during this session, which was even more intense. This is because at this time, the prohibition of opium was being relaxed. The people in various places were determined to hold anti-drug campaigns, and enthusiastic groups in various places also regarded the importance of the opium prohibition issue, so most of them also participated. This is indeed a good phenomenon in the anti-drug campaign. In the future, this spirit should be expanded and continued to make compatriots in various places understand the importance and urgency of the opium prohibition administration. The anti-drug campaign should be regarded as a necessary auxiliary movement for the masses in the process of implementing opium prohibition. Not only should they take the lead in advocating it, but they should also hold it together with the local people on the scheduled date of Anti-Drug Week. In order to encourage administrative personnel in various places, the Ministry of Interior should formulate a national examination method. The association specially decided to submit a petition to the Ministry of Interior, ordering the civil affairs departments of various provinces to forward it to the governments of various cities and counties, from October 1st to 7th every year, to routinely carry out Anti-Drug Campaign Week according to the regulations of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, and to conduct practical assessments for rewards and punishments, and to publish this anti-drug date in the calendar to mark it and not forget it.</p>
<p>(5) Methods for the Enriching the Country Day Campaign (A) Significance: A rich country has strong people, and a poor country has weak people. This is a matter of course. The opium poison has harmed our country, ravaged the race, and hindered construction, causing the foundation of the country to shake and the people's lives to be in distress. The money lost by our country every year due to opium poisoning is countless. If this financial resource is used for construction, it will benefit the country in unlimited ways. Today, the fundamental remedy is to remove the obstacles to construction and quickly fill the leaks. Then the country's future may be saved. (B) Purpose: The purpose of the Anti-Drug Enriching the Country Day is to unite compatriots, unanimously reject drugs, promote domestic construction, and resist foreign poisons. (C) Methods (1) Hold anti-drug speeches at school morning meetings; (2) Student teams go out in four directions to promote anti-drug; (3) Hold student anti-drug speech or debate competitions; (4) Hold student anti-drug essay competitions; (5) Hold student anti-drug amusement galas; (6) Hold competitions to promote the sale of monthly publications; (7) Organize student anti-drug propaganda meetings; (8) Hold anti-drug oaths.</p>
<p>(6) Outline for the Enriching the Country Day Propaganda Opium and all kinds of narcotic drugs have harmed China for more than a day. It is not only a matter of economic deduction, but also the biggest reason for the increasing poverty of people's lives. From the middle of the Qing Dynasty to today, for more than a hundred years, the British have continuously transported a large amount of Indian and Persian opium into China, exchanging it for tens of thousands of taels of silver to go. If we estimate that China buys foreign goods for 25 million taels every year, then in the past 100 years, it has been 2.5 trillion taels. China has suffered this huge loss in the recent 100 years of national poverty and financial exhaustion. How can we imagine the impact on the national economy? In the past 20 years, in addition to opium, there have also been narcotic drugs transported from various countries in the East and West, such as morphine, heroin, cocaine, red and white pills, etc. The value is ten times that of opium. The amount is even more immeasurable. The country's consumption is increasing and the leaks are getting bigger every day. This is something to be noted. (1) Nearly 8 million overseas Chinese live on islands in Southeast Asia. The families of these overseas Chinese remit money every month to support their lives. However, for many years, the powers have vigorously implemented a drug policy in the islands of Southeast Asia and Indochina, enticing overseas Chinese to become addicted to drugs and collecting huge taxes every year. It is pitiful that ignorant overseas Chinese have since fallen into the black register from which they can never recover. The income from hard work every day is used for food, clothing, and smoking, and they are still worried that it is not enough. Let alone remit money back to the country and mail it to their relatives. If we estimate that 30% of all overseas Chinese are smokers, then the money that should be remitted back to the motherland every year is swallowed by the colonial governments of the powers. How can the amount not be surprising? The impact on the national economy can be imagined. This is something to be noted. (2) Since the fifth year of the Republic of China, wars have been frequent and the opium prohibition in various provinces has been extremely chaotic. Corrupt local bullies have risen up to deceive rural farmers and plant poppies. In the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, and recently in northern Anhui and southern Fujian, opium seedlings are all over the ground and are endless. Farmers already know the benefits of growing opium, so they have followed each other in abandoning grain and planting this poisonous substance, resulting in frequent famines in the provinces along the river in northern Jiangsu. There is no grass in the fields, and the five grains are not harvested. The disaster of civil unrest and the dead bodies of refugees are everywhere, and the red earth is thousands of miles. The seriousness of the disaster and the magnitude of the impact can be told by anyone who pays a little attention to current affairs. The southeastern provinces, which are known for their wealth, have always transported rice and grain to East Asia. In recent years, there has been a shortage of grain. They have had to buy rice and grain from Siam and Annam. The amount of leakage every year is unimaginable. Although the reasons for this are not the same, the planting of opium in many provinces is indeed a step towards disaster. Its direct and indirect impact on the national economy is extremely large. This is something to be noted. (3) In the past 20 years, the drug situation has gradually expanded. There are farmers who plant opium, workers who manufacture opium, merchants who sell opium, smugglers who transport opium, and smokers who smoke opium. Recently, there are also officials who specialize in opium, military police who crack down on smuggling, local gentry who contract donations, and local tyrants who protect rural farmers. All of the above, in various forms, rely on opium for their livelihoods. They even use illegal powers to collect money as the opium prohibition is opened. If we count the people who are directly and indirectly related to opium, there are probably tens of millions in the country. Most of the families of these tens of millions of people have fallen into the black box. This is also an expected event. These tens of millions of useful people do not engage in legitimate occupations, but use illegal poisonous substances to collect money. How can the impact on the national economy be imagined? This is something to be noted. (4) In this eventful century in which China is located, the national industry and commerce has been in a state of depression due to foreign economic aggression. Moreover, due to the direct and indirect squeeze of opium and narcotic drugs, the people's livelihood has fallen into a desperate situation. This is indeed something that must be paid attention to. China was originally an economically backward country, so how can it permanently follow this disaster? For the plan now, all of our people and anti-drug comrades should know that enriching the country is the only way to save the people's livelihood in China. The phenomenon of today's stagnation is caused by opium. If we can rise up and unite all the people in the country to reject drugs and eliminate all opium and narcotic drugs, and use the money spent on opium to construct the country, such as revitalizing education and developing transportation, then the people's livelihood can become increasingly prosperous, and the wealth of China can be expected. Opium and narcotic drugs were originally a drug policy implemented by the powers against us. If we do not think of vigorously resisting it, what will be the consequences? Rejecting drugs is a necessary method for enriching the country. There is no doubt about it. I hope that all the people in the country will pay attention to it three times.</p>
<p>(7) Promoting the Construction of the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall During the commemoration of the national humiliation agreement on June 3rd this year, all sectors of Shanghai decided to build the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall in Shanghai to trace the past and encourage the future. A preparatory committee has been formed to be responsible for the preparation and progress of the work, which has been reported in previous newspapers. The association intends to promote the early success of the memorial hall during this Anti-Drug Week. The memorial hall preparatory committee has decided to proceed with various plans as soon as possible, and to establish the Shanghai Memorial Hall as soon as possible so that provinces, cities, and counties can continue to hold activities.</p>
<p>(8) Proposal to Establish an International Anti-Drug Alliance In recent years, our country has suffered from the harm of domestic opium planting and the tea poison of foreign narcotic drugs. The situation is tragic and unbearable. Since its establishment, the association has done its best to fight, and has achieved many results. Judging from today's situation, domestic opium prohibition has not been effectively implemented and does not rely on public opinion. The manufacture of foreign drugs cannot be stopped by our country alone. As for the concessions and leased territories, as well as foreign rogues, they are all obstacles to our country's opium prohibition. It is impossible to deal with this difficult and complex problem without the strength of countries that sympathize with the national system. Sympathetic groups in European and American countries have repeatedly requested cooperation from the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, requesting that the people of our country, who have suffered the most, initiate the establishment of an International Anti-Drug Alliance to strengthen momentum and increase strength. At the association's fifth annual meeting, the Combined National Body Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association made the same suggestion. Considering the situation, the anti-drug movement will either advance or retreat. It is difficult to achieve good results without further planning. The proposed methods are as follows, and are submitted for public decision: 1. The association will send letters to solicit opinions from European and American anti-drug groups, sympathetic groups, and enthusiastic leaders; 2. International groups, such as Christian churches, Catholic churches, women's alliances, and the Red Cross, should be contacted; 3. The association should send letters to foreign ambassadors and overseas Chinese leaders and groups to engage in assistance and advocacy in their resident countries in advance; 4. The association should send representatives to European and American countries to contact comrades and initiate the organization of this plan. The executive committee discussed the plan submitted by the secretariat and generally approved it. It was decided to appoint Wang Jingqi, Wu Liande, Ding Shujing, Cai Rudong, Guo Baoyi, Zhong Keto, Huang Jiawei, etc. to form a review committee to pass a detailed plan to be drafted by Wang Jingqi and Huang Jiawei.</p>
<p>(9) Foreign Groups Send Letters Requesting Cooperation The American White Cross Anti-Drug Association, knowing that our country's 7th National Anti-Drug Week is being held this year, has sent a letter expressing its willingness to cooperate. The letter reads in part: "I have read the letter from Chief Secretary Huang of the Shanghai Chinese National Anti-Drug Association. The association is working hard to reject drugs and attaches importance to international work. It is very willing to expand the scope of this movement and cooperate with foreign groups. Our colleagues will follow and work hard." Other groups, such as the anti-opium association founded by the Dutch in Batavia and the World Anti-Drug Education, have also sent many letters with similar meanings, which will not be repeated.</p>
<p>(10) Airplanes Distribute Leaflets The Navy dispatched airplanes to distribute more than 200,000 leaflets in the air. For a time, snowflakes flew. The leaflets were rectangular and contained a picture of a life-and-death juncture, the date of the 7th Anti-Drug Week, and an oath. It is said that if the oath form of this leaflet is filled in with the name and a four-cent postage stamp is mailed to the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, a copy of the excellent anti-drug publication will be presented. (11) Recent Statistics on the Opium Disaster Among Overseas Chinese In British Malaya, in 1929, the total number of imported opium was 3,843 boxes. The total weight of opium sold to Singapore was 3,037,272 taels. There were a total of 65 opium selling places, including 31 in Singapore, 20 in Penang, 12 in Malacca, 1 in Nakan, and 1 in Christmas Island. The total consumption of opium for the year was 1,152,196 taels. The total income was 14,804,769 yuan (more than 14 million yuan). 1,857,536 taels were transported from Singapore and Penang to the interior of the Malay Federation. As for the number of registered smokers, it was 40,956. Among them, foreign smokers accounted for 93 Indians and 40 Malays. The remaining 40,823 were overseas Chinese from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong in our country. The total income from opium was 12,938,721 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Cancellation of the Jin Song Qing Ping Bandit Suppression Temporary Command Post <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The bandit leader Tai Bao A Shu has fled to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Xiong Shihui, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces, previously appointed Hu Zhengji as the temporary commander of bandit suppression in Jin (shan), Song (jiang), Qing (pu), and Ping (hu), and ordered the suppression to be completed by the end of September. The establishment of the temporary command was originally intended to specifically suppress the bandit Tai Bao A Shu. Recently, because the bandit leader has been repeatedly suppressed by the military police of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in the Taihu, Dianshan Lake, Dazheng Mountain, and Xiaozheng Mountain areas, they have all fled. Therefore, the temporary commander Hu Zhengji submitted a special request to the general command headquarters the day before yesterday to temporarily cancel the bandit suppression temporary command headquarters. His original request stated in part: "Your department was ordered to suppress bandits, and has supervised the army and police day and night to search and suppress in separate routes. Recently, it was found that after the bandit Tai Bao A Shu was suppressed, his entire bandit gang has indeed been dispersed. A small number have fled back to the Jinping area and have also changed their tactics, decentralizing themselves and hiding in rural villages to avoid the eyes and ears of the government. With such a small number of vagrant bandits, it is not only difficult for the military police to capture them, but even the local people do not know their whereabouts. Moreover, the counties are holding a cleaning campaign, so the bandit suppression temporary command headquarters can be temporarily cancelled. The bandit suppression troops, with one company stationed in each of the two counties, assist the water police in searching and suppressing and handling the cleaning campaign," etc. Now Commander-in-Chief Xiong has approved the cancellation.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Request to Revoke the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Rice Export Ban <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government submitted a document to the Executive Yuan. The Municipal Government submitted a document to the Executive Yuan stating: "It is submitted for consideration. According to the report submitted by Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, the Rice Food Committee of the city submitted a report stating: At the 18th regular meeting of your committee, Commissioner Cai Yukun made a temporary motion that because the export of Zhejiang rice is banned, the price of rice is lower than that in Shanghai. Farmers will have difficulty selling their new rice at a good price and will inevitably be disappointed. Moreover, because Jiangsu and Zhejiang are intertwined, it is appropriate to allow circulation. Please forward the matter for handling. It was decided to forward the matter to the National Government to reiterate the ban on hoarding rice and allow free circulation in various places, but strictly prohibit private exports overseas to feed the people. Please review and forward," etc. In view of this, the domestic rice circulation has already been governed by the National Government’s General Order. This Zhejiang province rice export ban, we assume, is because Zhejiang rice has never been self-sufficient and should leave a surplus to prepare for a shortage. Also, they may be afraid that after the rice is exported, it will be smuggled overseas. Its aim is probably similar to the ban on the export of Jiangsu rice. However, Jiangsu and Zhejiang are interconnected and intertwined. To transport Zhejiang rice into Zhejiang, it must pass through Jiangsu territory. To transport Jiangsu rice into Jiangsu, it must pass through Zhejiang territory. If each other issues a ban, they will lose the benefits of circulation. Farmers are eager to sell goods, but they are afraid of congestion. Merchants take advantage of their failings to suppress their values. Although there is a reality of a good harvest, the gains are no different from a famine year. At this time, silver has fallen and all things are expensive, but agricultural products are uniquely cheap. How can farmers survive? To prevent smuggling overseas, it is necessary to jointly enforce the sea ban and rectify customs. It is not the business of various provinces to obstruct the flow of rice between themselves. Therefore, to maintain the people's food supply in the present situation, we must first transfer the surplus to the deficit to maintain a reasonable price of rice and grain, so that farmers do not damage their capital and merchants do not lose their profits. Only then can the treacherous merchants have no hope for illegal gains from smuggling overseas. If the price of rice falls due to the blockade of the territory, the treacherous merchants will come up with all sorts of tricks. The ports of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are different, and the sea ban is slightly sparse. Smuggling is inevitable. If there is a consideration of the pain of foreign rice imports and the outflow of money in past years, we should think about a rainy day and plan for the safety of the people's food supply in the country. We should follow the legacy of Changping to restore warehousing. The fundamental plan is nothing more than this. Prohibiting exports will only make matters more complicated. It is difficult to expect a good result. It will only make farmers and merchants miserable and will not benefit the people's livelihood. Given the previous situation, may we ask your government to forward the matter to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to revoke the order banning the export of rice and grain and jointly strictly prevent smuggling at the seaports? Or may we forward the matter to the Executive Yuan for review and instruct them to comply? We submit this document for your review and instructions for compliance." In view of this, smuggling rice and grain overseas should be strictly prohibited. As for the provinces, if the export of rice is uniformly prohibited and circulation is mutually obstructed, not only will farmers and merchants be困, but also the future of the people's food supply will be greatly affected. The matters reported by the bureau are not without merit. In addition to the instructions, we submit this document for your review and prompt instructions to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to revoke the measures banning the export of rice, and at the same time, we should pay more attention to preventing smuggling at the seaports to feed the people, which is indeed a public convenience.</p>

<p>A Kidnapping Case Cracked on the Songshan Maru</p>
<p>The Songshan Maru steamer docked at the Yangjiadu pier in Pudong the day before yesterday. Kidnapper Gu A Da and others were found to have kidnapped three boys, intending to sell them in Xiamen and Hong Kong. Before the boat had set sail, a detective from the First District of the Water Police Force received a report from an informant and went to investigate. The kidnappers Gu A Da, Jiang Guo Ren, Ji Lan Sheng, Zhou A Mao, Tian Xiao Heshang, Wang Rui Rong, Gu Han Lin, and a woman Xu Zhou Shi were caught on the spot, along with the kidnapped boys Du Lin Fang, Li Zhan Fang, and Hua A Di. They were immediately sent to the First District Headquarters. After interrogation, they confessed to the kidnapping and trafficking without denial. Zhou A Mao, only nineteen years old, was also a kidnapper, specializing in acting like a child and luring children into their trap. Zhou also confessed that Zhou A Gen, living at No. 195 Runde Lane, Huanghe Road in the French Concession, provided the kidnappers' hideout. The district immediately dispatched detectives accompanied by the police to arrest Zhou A Gen and rescued two more kidnapped boys, Zhu You Quan and Wang Xiao San, who were taken to the headquarters. The case has been clarified, and the kidnapped boys will be kept for their families to claim them. If there are no family members, they will be sent to the relief association for care. The gang of kidnappers was sent to the local court for investigation yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Sinks Stone Boat</p>
<p>The Ryusbo Maru, a Japanese merchant ship of the Nisshin Company, was importing goods into Shanghai from overseas at 6:45 p.m. the night before last. As it approached the Pudong surface near the China Merchants Bureau's Central Pier, it encountered a pier boat owned by Dai Kai Fa, loaded with 52 tons of stones, sailing downstream. The Japanese ship was traveling very fast, and due to careless steering, it crashed head-on into the stone boat, causing it to rupture and sink to the bottom of the river along with its cargo. Eight boatmen fell into the water at the same time. Six were rescued with great effort, but two remain missing and are presumed drowned. It is reported that the loss of the boat and cargo is significant, and the cargo owner is preparing to negotiate with the offending shipping company to claim compensation.</p>
<p>Died from Taking Poison Due to Poverty</p>
<p>Zhang Cheng Quan, a 37-year-old man from Wuxi, made a living selling smoked sausages. He and his wife rented a garret at No. 8 Dongxin Lane, Maidie An Road (formerly Xinjie) in the French Concession. His wife suffered a difficult childbirth a month ago and was sent to the Maternity Hospital. After the doctor performed a surgery to deliver the baby, Zhang's wife died due to weakness. Zhang managed to arrange the funeral. On the 5th of this month, which was the seventh week after his wife's death, Zhang, due to poverty and gambling losses, became despondent and took his own life by swallowing raw opium in the morning. After taking the poison, he lay down to die. When the poison took effect and he moaned, his roommate Chen Bing Rong and the sub-landlord found out and took Zhang to Renji Hospital. However, the poisoning was too severe, and he died at 2 p.m. that afternoon. The hospital notified the Grand Self-Ringing Bell Police Station, which sent detectives to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. The detectives found that the deceased had no family. The detectives reported this to the head detective and are awaiting an autopsy today. The deceased's friends are preparing clothing and a coffin and will arrange for burial after the examination.</p>
<p>An Elderly Man Died of Anxiety from Unsuccessful Debt Collection</p>
<p>Zhu Chun San, the owner of the Zhu Chun Ji Rice Shop outside the South City Bund in this city, was nearly sixty years old. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, he went to Nanjing with his son to collect debts. Unexpectedly, a debtor owed over five thousand taels of silver and went into hiding. Because Zhu could not collect the debt, he was extremely anxious and burst into tears. He became ill due to anxiety, and his son helped him onto a train to Wang Zi Ming's house, his relative in Nanguang outside the North Gate of Wuxi, to rest temporarily and seek medical treatment. However, Zhu was old and weak and could not bear the worry and anxiety, and he died the day before yesterday. His son urgently telegraphed his mother in Wuxi yesterday to take a train to Wuxi to arrange the funeral. This is truly a tragic incident amidst the debt collection at the end of September.</p>
<p>A Madman Laughs and Cries</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3 p.m., a man suddenly appeared in the Dongjiadu area of the South City, walked near the Bund, and jumped into the Huangpu River when people were unprepared. Li Chang Yong, a guard on duty at the 16th post, saw this and rushed to rescue him, saving his life. When asked why he jumped into the river to die, he spoke incoherently, as if mentally disturbed. He was taken back to the First Section of the First District Police Station. When the section chief interrogated him, asking his name and address, he suddenly laughed up to the sky, and when asked why, he suddenly lowered his head and cried incessantly. Since he seemed to be a madman, there was no way to investigate further. He was instructed to prepare a document to report to the Municipal Police Bureau to request placement.</p>
<p>An Ungrateful Friend and a Shameless Wife</p>
<p>Li Zhen Fu Repaid Kindness with Evil</p>
<p>Li Zhen Fu, a 33-year-old man from Haizhou, worked as a laborer and lived on Wanyu Street in the South City. His wife, Zhang, was 21 years old and had a reputation for being flirtatious. Li had a friend, Zhou Ke Shun, a 29-year-old man from Siyang, who was unemployed and struggling financially. He was also suffering from illness. Li took pity on him and allowed him to stay at his home temporarily, providing food and lodging for him to recuperate. Yesterday afternoon, Li went out on business. Around 2 p.m., he suddenly returned home to get something. Unexpectedly, he stepped into the bedroom and saw Zhou Ke Shun and his wife, Zhang, both naked in bed. Li was extremely angry at this situation, as he had shown kindness only to be betrayed. He immediately rushed forward to restrain them. The man and woman had already realized they were discovered and jumped out of bed to put on clothes and try to escape. Li ran out and called for help from Liang Jin Hai, a guard on duty at the 8th post, who took both of them to the First Section of the First District Police Station. After a preliminary interrogation by the section chief, they were ordered to be detained separately for further investigation.</p>
<p>Ruan Wu Shao Receives an Extortion Letter</p>
<p>Ruan Mu Bo, also known as Ruan Wu Shao, a native of Jiangdu residing at No. 13 Huanlong Lane, West Messerti Road, French Concession, is the direct grandson of the former Qing Dynasty Yangzhou Grand Tutor Ruan. He is known for being sociable, generous, and charitable. Everyone in the Huaiyang area knows Ruan Wu Shao. Li Jing Lin, the former Zhili Governor, was one of Mr. Ruan's sworn friends. (Mr. Ruan is the fifth child, and people respect him by calling him Wu Shao.) Although he is over sixty years old, due to his wide social circle and lack of permanent property, he is always busy running a business to make a living. Unexpectedly, he recently received an extortion letter demanding 5,000 yuan. The words in the letter were extremely aggressive. Mr. Ruan laughed it off. Yesterday, he mentioned it to friends and relatives, and onlookers were outraged and strongly urged him to report it to the police for a thorough investigation. However, Mr. Ruan is naturally kind and stopped them, hoping the perpetrators would reform. It is reported that he vacated the house in Huanlong Lane yesterday, auctioned off the furniture, and returned to Jiangdu to recuperate.</p>
<p>A Young Woman Swallows Opium for a Gold Ring</p>
<p>Dies from Lack of Medical Treatment</p>
<p>Zhang A Feng, a 17-year-old young woman from Ningbo, lived at No. 12 Songbai Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession. Her husband worked for a tobacco company. Yesterday afternoon, she wanted to exchange a gold ring, but her husband refused, causing an argument. Depressed, she secretly swallowed raw opium. When people noticed, she was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the opium poison attacked her heart, and she died around 8 p.m. due to lack of treatment.</p>
<p>Kunshan Painting Theft Case</p>
<p>The victim Xu Wu Qi, who lived at the Laifu Hall on Dongtang Street in Kunshan, was a well-known local gentry and a lover of antiques and famous paintings. Xu passed away this spring. During the funeral in March, Wu Meng Chang and Wu Kang Hou, brothers from Taiping Bridge in the same county, conspired with Yao Long Hai's son, Gen Quan (a carpenter), to steal over a hundred pieces of valuable paintings and antiques from Xu's house. Among them were Tang Yin's "Hundred Birds Worshipping the Phoenix" and Wang Shigu's "Ten Thousand Miles of Yangtze River," worth about ten thousand taels of silver. The thief Yao Gen Quan hid the stolen goods in Wu Kang Hou's house without anyone knowing. After many days, someone secretly informed the Xu family, who immediately checked and found that the items had indeed been stolen. They immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, requesting an investigation. Team Leader Wei Xu Chu immediately dispatched the entire team of detectives to arrest the suspects at their addresses. However, the thieves Yao Gen Quan and the Wu brothers had already fled with the stolen goods after hearing the news. Only Yao Gen Quan's father, Yao Long Hai, was arrested. The main suspects in this case are the Wu brothers, and Kang Hou has considerable savings, claiming to have a hundred thousand taels. He is a shareholder in a sock factory on Main Street in the county and has sock factories in the British and French Concessions in Shanghai. Therefore, the Wu brothers fled to the Shanghai Concessions. The Public Security Bureau ordered Detective Team Leader Wei Xu Chu to prepare a document and send detectives Wang Yun Shan to Shanghai in July to cooperate with the Concession Police in the arrest, but they were not found. Later, Wu Kang Hou asked someone to mediate with the victim and returned ten famous paintings. However, half of the other items had already been sold and could not be returned, so the case was delayed until now. Unexpectedly, the Wu brothers are hiding in the Concessions, evading the law. It is recently heard that they have sold the paintings to a Westerner, and they have fallen into foreign hands. Therefore, the Xu family has again petitioned the Public Security Bureau to send detectives to Shanghai to investigate. It has been bought, and the line is being pursued.</p>

<p>Li Shi Zeng, a member of the Central Committee, took the night train to Beijing last night to visit Chairman Jiang and discuss important matters.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Responds Regarding the Date of Dismissal of Shop Employees</p>
<p>Should Be Handled in Accordance with the Gregorian Calendar for Closing Accounts</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of submitting a draft of measures for the dismissal of employees in various industries in accordance with the order for review and approval. We found that we previously received Instruction No. 813 from your Bureau, instructing us to conduct a detailed investigation into whether there were any obstacles after changing the hiring and dismissal of shop employees in various industries to be in accordance with the Gregorian calendar and to draft implementation measures to be reported for approval. After forwarding this to various industry guilds for review and reply, we subsequently received replies from over forty guilds, including those for miscellaneous grains, oil cakes, bean rice, silk fabrics, sauce gardens, Chinese medicine, liquor, and pawnshops. The majority requested that, in accordance with past customs and the Gregorian calendar, the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December be the dates for closing accounts for the three festivals, which would also be the dates for dismissal of employees in various industries. Although there were occasional cases where the standard was the peak or off-season of business, or dismissals occurred in February, August, May, or December, or only once at the end of each year, these were only a minority. We submitted the habits of various industries in their replies to the Labor-Management Issues Research Committee of the Association for detailed review. The review results indicated that the old habits of employee hiring and dismissal were generally based on the three festivals each year. Now that the Gregorian calendar is being implemented, the majority opinion of various industries should be followed, with the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December of the Gregorian calendar each year being the dates for the dismissal of employees. However, in the event of major incidents, temporary dismissals may be made. The Pen and Ink Industry Guild raised concerns about calculating the delayed dismissal of employees by one month according to the Gregorian calendar, as ordered. We believe that this proposed delay is specifically for debt contracts, and it seems inappropriate to apply it to employee hiring and dismissal. The closing of accounts for shops is inherently linked to the hiring and dismissal of employees. If the calculation is changed to be delayed by one month according to the Gregorian calendar, the shop's profit and loss and business expansion and contraction would mostly become things of the past, and there would be no need to hire or dismiss employees. From the perspective of the employees themselves, the dismissal date would have passed, and the hiring and dismissal of employees in various shops would have been finalized, making it impossible to switch to other shops. Both parties would feel inconvenienced, and there is indeed room for correction." This was raised for discussion at the 14th Standing Committee meeting of the Association on the 2nd of this month. It was deemed that the results of the review took into account laws, customs, business conditions, and other aspects and could serve as an appropriate method of dismissal after the adoption of the Gregorian calendar. It was resolved to submit this to your Bureau for review and instruction. It is appropriate to prepare a document to submit for review and to be given instructions to follow, as it would be in the public interest.</p>
<p>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Grain Statistics</p>
<p>January to August</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau released grain statistics for this year, stating that the rice price this year increased from February after poor harvests in various regions last year. The price even reached over ten yuan the following month, and the average price of japonica rice reached 20 yuan and 5 cents. Starting in May, the Bureau began registering rice boats and evaluating prices. When there was a shortage of goods, the average price of high-priced rice was distributed to various rice shops to avoid competition and eliminate hidden discounts. In July, new grain entered the market, and a bumper harvest was expected, and the price gradually fell. In September, new rice flooded in, and the decline will be even more drastic. Amidst the high rice prices, the Bureau presented to the Municipal Government to implement flat pricing and distributed rice at more than ten locations. The small people who eat grain received significant benefits. The harvest of small grains this year was mediocre. After the new wheat entered the market, the price of flour and wheat failed to fall significantly and was subject to manipulation by speculators. After repeated investigations of the accounts, the price gradually declined from July. The price statistics for rice and wheat flour from January to August of the 19th year are listed below.</p>

<p>Thoughts on the Xiao Case by Zhao Ding Ming</p>
<p>Ms. Xiao Xin An accepted a position at the Pei De School for Overseas Chinese in Ambon Island, Makassar, in the South Seas. The insults she suffered from the second mate of the Dutch Java Line, the various experiences, and the shared indignation of the Dutch Overseas Chinese and the people of the country have been fully disclosed in this newspaper. We must regard Ms. Xiao's enthusiasm for overseas Chinese education as an exceptional case of a lone woman sailing overseas. The melancholy mood she experienced on the ship cannot be appreciated by travelers who have not personally experienced it. But if we put ourselves in her shoes, we can imagine the kind of terror and anxiety she felt and arouse sympathy. Below are my personal thoughts on the Xiao case.</p>
<p>I seem to have seen Ms. Xiao's face one day at the Oriental Bookstore when Mr. Huang Jing Wan was looking at a large batch of photos attached to the passports of female teachers going to the South Seas. However, because Mr. Huang, who is enthusiastic about social work, was talking and walking in a hurry, I only vaguely compared them. Ms. Xiao's appearance seemed to be more heroic than the other women. But observing their uniformly simple attire and the excited attitude of each, one cannot help but admire their spirit of sacrificing themselves for overseas Chinese education and wish them well. However, less than a month after they set sail on August 14, the newspapers reported that two or three female teachers going to the South Seas were prevented from landing and sent back on the original ship. People with backbone cannot help but feel indignant. On September 26 and 28, various newspapers repeatedly published various reports about the Xiao case. I think that everyone with the blood of the Yellow Emperor race would feel the same excitement about the insults Ms. Xiao suffered. Ms. Xiao, disregarding the heavy damage to her heart and her personal reputation, resolutely revealed everything in detail. At the same time, various associations and schools sent telegrams of support and urged the National Government to seriously negotiate with the Netherlands. I think that any rational country should uphold justice and that the Xiao case should not be difficult to resolve satisfactorily. However, I saw that Ms. Xiao's letter to a friend contained such negative language as "What is the joy of being alive? Life is not worth cherishing. Only my old mother makes me worry about how to reassure her. I am living a few more days only for this." I sincerely hope that Ms. Xiao will not only not be pessimistic in the future, but also not need to be pessimistic. She should promote this great spirit and further express her instinct to serve society. This minor flaw cannot hide her supreme qualities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I hope that all young men and women of the entire Chinese nation will become enlightened and unite to stand on the front line under the banner of the Blue Sky with a White Sun and move forward. Otherwise, all kinds of humiliation will come one after another.</p>
<p>Small Record of Watching the Tide by Shou Qiu Qing</p>
<p>The sound of the Qiantang River tide is heard at home and abroad. The time of the osmanthus fragrance is especially a great sight. Recorded in history books and spread by word of mouth, those who have not seen it are eager to see it, and those who have seen it are never tired of watching it. The shape of the tide is not uniform, some are large, some are small, some are complete, some are missing, all are like overlapping snow, or like rolling mountains. Watching the tide on a moonlit night is especially interesting. The Qiantang River tide, which is well known, has this majestic and wonderful appearance, which cannot be matched by other places. It is said that the autumn tide this year is extremely large, the largest in more than ten years. When friends meet, they often use this as a topic of conversation. However, since I have been in Hangzhou, I have watched the tide many times. The highest is no more than four or five feet, and the smallest is irrelevant. Although it is the most powerful tide, it has not reached the realm of rushing. I sigh that I am unlucky, so I hesitate. Yesterday, after dinner, my interest in traveling suddenly moved. I went to Jianggan with my second son, Yingwei. It was still early. I sat on the floating boat at the first pier and heard people talk about Jiangshang's affairs, which was quite funny. But Yingwei could no longer bear it, so he went ashore to drink tea at the Guanhai Tower and looked out over the railing. The river was vast, but it was a pity that the building was high and the distance was far, and the tide might not be able to be seen closely. Suddenly, I heard people say that the tide in Xixing was higher and larger than in Jianggan. The highest day was as high as the abdomen of the bus station. The general people waiting for the ferry by the river were almost completely wet. I suddenly realized that there were more ladies crossing the river today than in the past. This is probably the reason. The Xixing River is only ten miles away from the Sanlang Temple. It can be reached in a moment. I took Yingwei on the ferry to the south bank. When I arrived at the shore, the viewers were already crowded like ants. At the end of the pontoon bridge, a large piece had been washed away by the tide. There was still water accumulated on the edge of the embankment. The waves must have been huge. I walked around the station, and the red flag at the ferry had already been raised. The whistle did not sound. I knew the tide was coming. Fearing being affected by the waves, I chose a high place that did not block the view and stood waiting. At this time, the people's voices suddenly rose, and the crowd shouted that the tide was coming. All eyes were focused on the heart of the river. Looking into the distance between the sky and the water, there was a wisp of white thread, appearing and disappearing in the mist. It was getting bigger and bigger, and getting closer and closer, like a rolled-up scroll, like a snowy practice. There was a faint thunder in the air, from small to small, from small to moving. At this time, the atmosphere of heaven and earth and the shape of the characters were unconsciously solemn. In a blink of an eye, the tide was like thousands of troops and horses rolling in, welcoming them. The snow waves were emptying, crossing the river for ten miles, the wind was rising and the clouds were surging, the heart was shocked and the eyes were dizzy. The earth was shocked by it, and the rivers and rivers were twisted. The shore was several feet high, and the waves were still grabbing people. The water was coming from the sky, rushing and leaping, the water was screaming and the thunder was roaring. Alas, how magnificent. This tide is truly a great view of the world. It is also the first original vision of my life. I am privately happy that I seized the opportunity and gained a broad vision. The most wonderful thing is that the tide reaches the edge of the bridge and becomes a cliff of several feet, rushing and flying, forming a strange sight. Those who stand on the edge of the embankment are caught off guard, look at each other and lose color. Those who sit on the railings of the bridge are wet with clothes and shoes, and are in a state of embarrassment. When the frightened souls have just settled down, they can't help but laugh at each other. Bold women taste the same taste, their faces are red, and they are also interesting stories in the sound of the tide. When the tide recedes, the water rises, as high as the embankment. The sound is rumbling, still with a lingering power. Standing</p>

If urgent relief measures are not taken, silk factories fear complete bankruptcy. The Silk Factory Association held a special emergency meeting of all factory owners and resolved to petition the government to issue 5 million yuan in silk industry bonds to rescue the silk factory industry in Shanghai. Chairman Shen Huachen and other committee members visited Zhang Shouyong, the Vice Minister of Finance, to personally explain the depressed state of the silk market. Vice Minister Zhang agreed to consider the matter further after receiving a detailed plan for issuing silk industry bonds and repayment methods. It is now learned that silk factory owners in Wuxi,</p>
<p>Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other cities all believe that this year's silk industry slump is unprecedented and fraught with danger. Silk factories in all regions are facing the same difficult conditions and should jointly appeal to the government along with Shanghai merchants. Representatives are now being sent to Shanghai to discuss cooperation with the Silk Market Relief Committee organized by the Shanghai Silk Factory Association and decide on a joint petition to the National Government's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting the issuance of 10 million yuan in silk industry bonds to provide widespread support. It is reported that representatives from silk factory owners in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places have formed the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Factory Industry Relief Committee in Shanghai to jointly plan action.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Aiding Silk Weaving Workers <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, eight labor unions, including the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Union, issued a declaration to aid the striking silk weaving workers of the Shanghai Silk Factory, saying: The hideous face of Japanese imperialism has become all too familiar to Chinese laborers. The bloodstains of the May 30th Massacre were entirely instigated by them. Without them, the assassination of Gu Zhenghong under iron hooves would not have led to the bloody events of May 30th. Tracing the source, the ferocity of Japanese imperialism is ultimately more harmful and malicious than others. This time, the silk weaving workers of the Shanghai Silk Factory, unable to endure their oppression, had no choice but to protest, leading to this strike. In fact, in this difficult living environment, we workers are already groaning and suffering beyond measure, and the evil Japanese capitalists are stirring up trouble, frequently adding oppression, reducing the original wages of the factory's workers by forty percent while increasing the workload by more than half. Such actions treat us laborers worse than cattle and horses. Their disregard for our nation is evident. The silk weaving workers of the Shanghai Silk Factory have been on strike for half a month. Although the superior authorities have mediated, their (the capitalists') attitude is very tough and they refuse to compromise. On the one hand, they are making empty promises, and on the other hand, they are using reactionary forces to force workers to return to the factory. In fact, their strategy is simply to make the workers yield. Our union, standing with the workers, cannot bear to stand idly by, like Qin Yue Ren ignoring the thin and weak, letting fellow laborers be oppressed and leaving a disgrace on the Shanghai labor movement. Therefore, we loudly appeal, hoping that all sectors will show sympathy, so that the hundreds of pitiful workers in the silk weaving department of the Shanghai Silk Factory can achieve final victory. Rather be a shattered jade than a whole tile, we vow to fight against the Japanese imperialist capitalists. Let all sectors be aware of this. In addition to jointly petitioning the superior authorities, we hereby declare, Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Union, Cleaning Industry First Special District Labor Union, Yutong Silk Weaving Union, Minsheng Yarn Factory Union, Huazhuang Binding Special District Labor Union, Bookstore Industry Union, Hongzhang Textile Union, China Industrial Silk Weaving Factory Union.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Concession Police Arrest a Large Group of Bandits <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Informant Reports Kidnapping</p>
<p>Police Unable to Confirm Yet</p>
<p>Fountain Pen Pistol Is Terrifying</p>
<p>A Puff of Smoke Causes Unconsciousness</p>
<p>Planned Kidnapping: Su Yinggen, a Chinese detective in the Concession Police, received a report on the 4th of this month from an informant, stating that a group of bandits intended to kidnap a resident surnamed in Taoyuan Lane on Huisan Road. Detective Su reported this to the police chief, who, along with Chinese Detective Chief Zhang Zhiqing, Su Changsheng, Patrol Detective Yang Xichen, Li Lianchuan, Liu Xuecheng, Chen Lianjing, Shi Baoying, and other Chinese and Western detectives on duty, disguised themselves and scattered around Taoyuan Lane to lie in ambush. At around 5:00 PM, a car with the number 2085 drove up and circled the entrance of Taoyuan Lane (there are seven entrances to this lane) four times for about twenty minutes before stopping at the intersection of Huisan Road and Zhoushan Road.</p>
<p>Waiting for the Leader Here: Three people jumped out of the car and stood by the road, whispering to each other. Detective Li Lianchuan happened to be standing next to them and heard them say that there were many patrols nearby today, so it would not be easy to succeed. They should come back tomorrow. They also asked Detective Li who he was. Li replied that he was a comrade waiting for the leader here (the organization of these bandits was quite complex, so they did not recognize their own comrades).</p>
<p>Three Bandits Arrested Shortly After: Soon after, the three were about to get back into the car and leave when they were captured by the detectives lying in ambush. The car was also seized and taken to the police station. Under questioning, the three bandits identified themselves as Qian Xingsheng, He Wenqing, and Zhou Rucai. Detective Chief Su searched the car and found three pistols and twenty bullets near the engine.</p>
<p>Leader's Wife and Children Apprehended: He also revealed that their leader was Wu Junling, from Anhui, who lived at No. 313 Kunming Road. The pistols and car belonged to Wu. Chinese and Western detectives went to No. 313 Kunming Road to arrest Wu, but Wu had already fled. Only his wife, Jin, his son, Peigong (also known as Peiyun), and accomplices Jin Lilin (also known as Lielin), Wu Shikui, Wang A Jin, and Wang Tong were arrested.</p>
<p>Fountain Pen Pistol: Many Communist Party commission documents appointing Wu as some kind of commander were found in the house, as well as a fountain pen-style pistol. The pistol was similar to a fountain pen, but slightly larger. It had a mechanism on top and contained a bullet. However, the bullet could not kill a person. It was filled with poison. Simply triggering the mechanism would shoot out the poison, which would turn into a puff of smoke. Anyone who inhaled it would become unconscious and would not wake up for half an hour. Wu's possession of this gun was intended to make the kidnap victim lose consciousness after being kidnapped so that they could not call for help along the way. His thoroughness shows that he is experienced in this matter. The detectives then took them all to the police station.</p>
<p>More Bandits Apprehended Later: The police also ordered detectives to wait in the house. Later, they successively arrested Zhu Shiping, Su Baorong, Yu Ruili, Zhou Junchao (Zhou is the principal of a school in Huzhou). The detectives also continued to arrest Xie Desheng, Ma Wencai, Xie Zheng, and three others at No. 996 Taopeng Road and brought them back to the police station.</p>
<p>Fresh Ink on the Sign: Wu Peigong confessed that his father had a Xinxin Paper Factory at the end of Taopeng Road. Chinese and Western detectives went to the paper factory to arrest him. When they arrived at the factory, they saw that the sign had been changed to Minghua, but the ink on the sign was not yet dry, indicating that it had not been changed for long. They then took the manager of the paper factory, Song Guangfu, and the sign back to the police station and detained them separately.</p>
<p>Leader Has Repeatedly Committed Major Crimes: Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case and said that the leader of this gang of bandits, Wu Junling, had repeatedly committed major crimes in the past. The former Provisional Court and your court had issued arrest warrants. There were as many as four arrest warrants. The police had not yet determined whether the defendants' actions were kidnapping or robbery, so they were temporarily prosecuting them under Article 161 of the Criminal Law for the crime of forming a gang of bandits. They would revise the charges after the investigation was clear.</p>
<p>Rescheduled for Special Hearing: Today, the case could not proceed based on the situation. A request was made to reschedule it for a special hearing in the afternoon. The defendant Wu Jin and Wu Peigong hired Fan Gang as their lawyer. Judge Feng Shide briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled for a special hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Another Principal Offender in the Embezzlement of Large Sums of Money Arrested <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Chen Jianji and His Wife</p>
<p>Chen Used the Alias Tang Baoshan</p>
<p>Visited the East Asia Hotel in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Recognized Only After Seeing the Photo</p>
<p>Banknotes Found in the Soles of Shoes</p>
<p>Chen Jianji and Bai Rishuan, the accounting officer and deputy accounting officer of the German-owned Lide Foreign Firm in Sha Ji, Guangdong, recently colluded to embezzle 33,000 yuan of the firm's money and fled to Shanghai. The firm's principal found out and telegraphed the German Consulate in Shanghai, which forwarded the matter to the General Police Station for investigation. On the night of the 3rd of this month, Chinese detectives Pang Ruiqing, Feng Zhiming, Wang Chengying, Feng Shuofu, and Western Detective Chief Baideng from the General Inspection Office arrested Bai Rishuan and He Rong, a tea server at Lide Foreign Firm, in Room 320 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. Chen had escaped. After Bai and He were escorted to the Special Court for preliminary hearing, the court ordered that Bai and He be handed over to Public Security Bureau detectives for transfer to the Guangzhou Court for trial. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now it is learned that the police, after Bai and others were arrested, still sent Chinese and Western detectives to wait in the room. At 5:30 PM on the 4th (Saturday), Chen Jianji, who had fled, under the alias Tang Baoshan, and his wife, Chen Tang, under the alias Tang Huang, visited Room 320 of the East Asia Hotel to inquire about Bai. The Chinese and Western detectives took out photos, and after checking them, they knew that he was Chen Jianji. They arrested Chen and his wife and took them to the police station. Under questioning, Chen still denied being Chen Jianji and claimed to be Tang Baoshan. The police chief then telephoned the Municipal Public Security Bureau and brought Bai and He back to the police station. Chen was mixed among the crowd of criminals and Bai was asked to identify him. Bai immediately pointed out Chen, and Chen bowed his head and said nothing. A 2,000 yuan note from the Deda Money Shop was found on Chen. Chen Tang was also searched by a female investigator, but nothing was found. Chen was ordered to be detained and Tang was sent to the women's detention center of the Special Court. Upon further searching, more than 3,000 yuan in Hong Kong HSBC banknotes, each worth 500 yuan, were found in the soles of her shoes. However, some of the banknotes had been torn by Tang. Yesterday morning, Chen and his wife were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Judge Zhou Hanting took the bench and interrogated them. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, presented the case and requested that the two defendants be transferred to the Public Security Bureau so that they could be transferred to the Guangzhou Court for interrogation along with Bai and the others. However, a 2,000 yuan note found on the defendant could be taken away by the German Consulate upon presentation of a receipt, because the police's case was based on the report of the German Consulate and the German Consulate had the qualification to represent the plaintiff. Wang Shenqing, an investigator from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, then submitted a document requesting transfer. When questioned, the defendant Chen Jianji confessed, "This matter was done by me alone and has nothing to do with Bai. I left my job on the 25th of last month and obtained 2,100 yuan in cash and a 25,000 yuan check from the company at that time. On the 4th of this month, I arrived in Shanghai with my wife and stayed at Room 3 of the Hongkou Hotel on North Sichuan Road. I went to the East Asia Hotel yesterday to visit Bai Rishuan after he was arrested. Bai's reason for coming to Shanghai was to open a gambling table, so the 2,000 yuan note confiscated by the police was remitted from Xiamen to Shanghai and could be exchanged for money. The money was entrusted by a friend for me to receive, so that it could be used as capital to join Bai's gambling table." When questioned, Chen Tang confessed, "I know nothing about this matter. This time, I came to Shanghai with my husband to travel. The more than 3,000 yuan in banknotes that were confiscated were also entrusted to me by my husband to carry on his behalf." After Judge Zhou checked the confessions, he ordered that the two defendants be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the Guangzhou Court for interrogation along with Bai and the others. The banknotes and notes would be temporarily kept in the police station for verification. The two defendants were then taken down by detectives. As soon as they left the courthouse door, Chen Tang suddenly said, "I carried a total of 10,000 yuan this time. The money was obtained by selling a house in Xiamen when we set off. Now that more than 3,000 yuan has been confiscated, there is still more than 6,000 yuan, but I don't know where it was lost." The Chinese and Western detectives were surprised to hear this, thinking that there might be other circumstances involved, so they took her to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Chinese Experts Establish New-Style Machine Factory <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Small, Genuine Diesel Engines Appear: Most of the machines used in China are imported, and with the high price of gold, the leakage is increasing. It is urgent to reverse this situation. Now, many machine experts have set up factories to manufacture them themselves in order to meet the needs of the times. The factory is named the Shanghai Machine Factory and is building factory buildings and installing new German-style machine tools on Danyang Road in Yangshupu. They will first manufacture four-horsepower diesel engine water pumps, rice milling machines, flour mills, etc. Because of the high price and large horsepower of foreign goods, it is difficult for ordinary people to use them, and most of the domestic-made machines with less than eight horsepower are kerosene engines. Now that kerosene prices have soared to four times the price of diesel, it is extremely uneconomical. Therefore, a small engine is specially made that uses genuine diesel as fuel and is not imitated from foreign goods, but a product of many years of research and ingenuity. The machine body is strong, easy to move, and has sufficient horsepower, equivalent to the work of more than twenty people. The cost is reduced, requiring only five or six cents a day. The efficiency is equal to that of foreign goods, and the price is lower than that of any other country. The founders and staff of the factory are all engineering experts who have studied in Europe for many years and have served in the domestic industry for a long time. They are determined to adopt a rational management method to achieve the purpose of high-quality goods, low prices, and small profits but quick turnover. Many types of goods have already been released for people to choose from, and the opening day will be chosen soon.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Baoming Electric Company Feeds Electricity to Zhabei Water and Electricity Company <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Public Utility Bureau Unifies Power Plants</p>
<p>First Step of the Plan Completed</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utility Bureau, in order to achieve economic power generation, has stipulated a plan to unify the city's power plants. The first step is to urge small power plants to stop generating electricity and purchase electricity from large power plants for resale. This has been actively carried out in recent years. Various electrical companies are also well aware of the benefits, so they are happy to comply. For example, the Zhenru and Xianghua Electric Companies have already implemented feeding electricity to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company one after another. The Pudong Electric Company has also signed a feeding electricity contract with the Huashang Electric Company and will soon stop generating electricity. The scale of the Baoming Electric Company is small, with only two violet oil generators with a total capacity of only about 230 kilowatts. Recently, the demand for electricity has gradually increased, and the maximum load is already above 200 kilowatts. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the equipment. The Public Utility Bureau believes that it is not as economical for small power plants to generate their own electricity as it is to purchase electricity from large power plants for resale, and the new Zhabei Jiansong Bridge Power Plant is about to generate electricity and is very close to Baoming Company, making it extremely convenient to connect the lines and power. Therefore, it instructed the company to stop expanding and negotiate with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to feed electricity. Subsequently, the two companies drafted a feeding electricity contract and submitted it to the Bureau for review. After correcting any inappropriate points, it was formally signed on September 15th and approved by the Bureau for record. It is learned that this contract will be implemented from January 1931. The first step of the plan for the two Public Utility Bureaus to unify the power plants has now been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Fine of 15 Yuan for Printing Obsolete Calendars <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Tang Yunji Bookstore in Siwen Lane on Datong Road, Huachang Printing Shop on North Chengdu Road, and Pei Zhang Bookstore on South Chengdu Road were all found by Inspector Ge Jingxuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to have printed obsolete calendars and almanacs, which violated the prohibition order. He reported this to the Special District Court, which issued a search warrant to the Xin Zha Police Station to send detectives. The three bookstores were found to have a large number of obsolete calendar books, which were sent to the Special Court. A summons was issued, but the owners of the bookstores did not arrive, so the court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent the bookstore owners Tang A gen, Hua Wenbin, and Wang Shaoshan to the Violation of Regulations Court. After questioning by Judge Shen Shumu, Tang, Hua, and Wang were each fined 15 yuan and the books were confiscated.</p>
