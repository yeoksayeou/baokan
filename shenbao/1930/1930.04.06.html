<p>今後世界大戰之惟一利器。人皆知爲空軍之飛機。海陸軍將退居於輔助之列。故誠欲希望實现和平。尤應於空軍上加以限制。歐洲各國於大戰後。在凡爾賽和約中。曾規定於一定時間内禁止一切飛機之建造與購買飛機塲亦須毀滅大半。蓋其時已知飛機之爲禍於戰爭甚烈。惟旋又經長時期之協</p>
<p>商。復允取銷前議。是此以後。戰敗之國。原氣稍復。即致力於競造軍事戰鬭飛機。而戰勝之國。更急急努力擴張。故空軍之進歩。一日千里。實可令人驚駭昨日美電。謂美陸軍航空隊飛機一百六十架。今日在空中操演。规模之大。爲太</p>
<p>平洋沿岸從來所未有。且不久將有太平洋各埠國防飛機大會操。盛况將遠過於今日。今日日電。則謂日海軍方面。爲塡補此次軍縮後减少兵力之缺陷。擬要求政府於五年内支出經費六千萬元。增造海軍常備飛機一千架以維持對美同等勢力。在此英美日三國協定成立聲中則以空軍示威一則亟增空軍勢力。以示對抗。此種消息不能不令人聞驚異也　　夫軍縮之意義。各减少自已之戰鬭力。以示不欲攻人之實信。限制海軍造</p>
<p>艦僅爲减少戰鬭力之一種。固將由海軍而及於陸空軍。漸次以逹軍縮之目的也。若於海軍方面。限制競爭造艦。而於陸空兩軍。仍自由競爭擴張。一若與軍縮無關則殊失軍縮之目的矣。此倫敦之海軍會議。千辛萬艱。日美間始稍有妥協之望。乃觀空軍方面之競爭如此。則妥協之结果不幾等於零乎。日内瓦國際聯盟原定六月中召集之海陸空軍縮减準備會議今據電訊行將展期。亦可以觇軍縮前途之趨勢矣。</p>

<p>白里安即日回巴黎一行</p>
<p>三國恊定大綱成立</p>
<p>日本擬增海軍常備飛機</p>
<p>▲路透社四日倫敦電　連日所抱關於五强海會之樂觀、今日已銷滅殆盡、聞三强協定氣象甚佳、但五强協定則無多大希望、今日英相麥唐納與外相漢德森將與法外長白里安共餐、以便討論法國公式、日前海會唯一希望、即在此耳、英國官塲發言人否認巴黎傳來英人已拒絕法國公式之説、並謂報紙所載意　外相格蘭第對外相而發之言論、亦屬傳言失實云、現從意代表方面探悉、格蘭第近日在談話時曾發海會當前之主要問題、乃軍縮而非政治一語、意外相離羅馬已十一星期、政務叢集、急待處理、但意外相不欲使事棘手、故迄未部署行裝、客有以海會之法意問題相詢者、意代表方面答稱、今不復爲意國要求同等之問題、但爲法國要求優勢之問題云</p>
<p>▲路透社四日倫敦電　聞美代表團以爲五强協定已屬無望、定四月二十二日乘輪返美、大約海會結果將爲英美日之三國協定、及五强間若干次要事件之協定而已、</p>
<p>▲路透社五日倫敦電　每日郵報稱、保守黨對於英法代表繼續討論一種公式、以迎合法國因海會而起之要求一事、大爲惶惑、將於星期一日在下院向首相提出種種詰問、如答語不能使人安心、則將要求辯論、將來辯論後之投票、如不利於政府、將使政府辭職云、每日驛報稱、英法談判成功之希望甚微、昨晚法外長白里安以無線電話與巴黎總理泰狄歐談話、二人皆斷定大局無望、</p>

<p>▲路透社五日東京電　聞海軍省現議要求將因英美日三國海軍協定所省下之費、移其一部分擴張海軍空航隊、由目下之十七隊增至二十八隊、共約飛機千架、需費日金六千萬元、藉以塡補因縮减潛艇噸数國防上所受之損失、消息靈通各界</p>
<p>皆視此説根據於有智識者之預料、惟首相今日對報界中人發言、謂政府尙未考慮此種性質之任何建議、但海軍次官確曾建議以三國協定所省下之費之一部分、用经增厚海軍武器之實力云、一般人士現信如協定果能簽定、每年可省日金一萬萬元以上、其大部分將用减輕捐税、救濟失業、餘欵或將用以增厚海軍天空防務、</p>
<p>▲路透社五日倫敦電　法外相白里安今晨與英首相麥唐納及英外相漢徳森聖哲木斯宮會談後宣稱、英法兩政府之見解今已視前接近、今晨已獲大進步、白氏定今日午後回巴黎、下星期二日再至倫敦、</p>

<p>▲楊行賄罪不成立</p>
<p>▲改科販運鴉片罪</p>
<p>濟南通信、前滋陽縣政府科長楊景春向民政廳秘書長寗坤、賄買縣長一案、先經濟南地方法院判决、楊處徒刑三月、檢察官不服、上訴於山東高等法院、昨該院已判决楊徒刑二年、但係販賣鴉片罪、其行賄罪認爲不成立、而爲介紹行賄之王士豪、則以詐欺未遂罪判處徒刑二年、因之一般與論對於該案判决、頗生疑賓、認爲投鼠忌器、茲錄判决書原文如下、</p>
<p>主文　原判决關於楊春王士豪宋景玉之部分撤銷、楊景春共同意圖販賣運輸鴉片罪、處有期</p>
<p>徒刑二年、裁判確定前　押日數、以二日抵徒刑一日、王士豪詐欺未遂罪、處有期徒刑二年、裁判確定前　押日數、以二日抵刑一日宋景玉及楊景春其他部分無罪、</p>
<p>事實　緣楊景春前充滋陽縣政府科長、經該縣縣長杭　呈准省政府及民政廳、以縣長存記錄用、遂來省寓新華公司、守候牌委、嗣見民政廳秘書長寗坤、聞有預備一語、因以詢問民政廳秘書處科員王士豪、則吿以許是人情之意并有一千元太少、非三千元不行等語、楊景春遂宋景玉帮需欵項、一面以新華公司見條付洋二千七</p>
<p>百元期條一紙、函送寗秘書長、請發表縣長、寗秘書長遂向民政廳朱廳長舉發、由廳將楊景春王士豪先後呈送省府、復由省府委員審查後、連同楊景春陳述與永昌漆店賈老八購買烟土各情形、一併報吿省府、函送本院檢察處、轉令濟南地方法院檢察官偵察起訴、該院審理判决後、檢察官不服、向本院上訴、查檢察官上訴意旨、（一）</p>
<p>略謂楊景春行賄一罪、僅處徒刑三月、量刑未免較輕、及楊景春述明同在逃之賈子玉、意圖販賣而運輸烟土、行至商埠靜安里、被不知姓名搜獲等語、認爲係自由陳述、應屬可信、（二）略謂王士豪於楊景春行賄之際、解釋預備二字即是人情意思、并稱送秘書長一千元之禮太少、大概得三千元、與王士豪供稱代楊景春轉求秘書長快發表縣長、及楊景春致寗坤原函内稱、深知某君係鈞台素信者等語、認爲有重要帮助（三）略謂宋景玉代楊景春介紹朋友、出錢運動縣缺且楊景春寄寓於新華公司、而二千七百元之期條、及載明該公司見條即付等語、認爲有帮助嫌疑、原審一并諭知無罪、殊欠允當云云、</p>
<p>理由　查刑法第一百二十八條第二項之規定、係以對於公務員關於職上之行、爲行求期約、或交付賄賂、或其他不正利益者、爲成立犯罪之要件、縣長之委用、須民政廳長提出省政府委員會議通過後、始能發表、非民政廳秘書長職務上之行爲、楊景春交付民政廳寗、坤秘書長二千七百元期條、請求發表縣長、是對於非其職務之公務員行求賄賂、顯與上開規定不符、原審以該條項判楊景春以有期徒刑三月、究屬錯誤、楊景春向無委用縣長職權之寗秘書長行求賄賂、旣不成立犯罪、則帮助楊景春籌措行賄欵項之宋景玉、自無刑事實任之可言、惟王士豪對楊景春解釋預備爲人情意思、并言一千元恐秘書長不在意、大概得三千元云云、致令楊景春大膽以二千七百元期條、用函交付寗秘書長、王士豪之行爲、實與意圖爲自已或第三人不法之所有、以詐術使人將本人或第三人所有物交付者、情形相合、特寗秘書長自已舉發事敗垂成、應以未遂論、至碭景春同賈子玉運輸烟土一節、檢閲省政府委員審查報吿、内有楊景春曾介、紹與永昌漆店賈老八、（即賈子玉）購買烟土三百兩、行至商埠靜安里内、被便衣四名、各持手槍、聲稱檢查、楊景春及賈老八因免被捕難看、遂自行散支烟土被便衣拿去、此項購買烟土之欵、即欲用之以付支票等語、楊景春與賈老八共同意圖販賣、而運輸鴉片烟、旣經自行陳述、事實决非處搆、自應成立販運鴉片烟罪、</p>
<p>據以上論結、本案上訴意旨、應認一部爲有理由、合依刑事訴訟法第三百八十五條第一項、將原判中關於上訴之楊景春王士豪宋景玉部撤銷、更爲判决、楊景春共同意圖販賣而運輸鴉片烟、與王士豪詐欺未遂、及宋景玉帮助行賄、特依禁烟法第六條、刑法第四十二條第六十四條第三百六十三條第一項第三項刑事訴訟法第三百十六條、判决如主文、本案經本院檢察官李琴鹤法庭執行職務、審判長推事趙之騤、推事李法先、推事潘康國、書記官蘇漢傑、</p>

<p>對英督提出十四條</p>
<p>否認外人之旣得權</p>
<p>世界新聞社云、印度不合作運動首領甘地氏於此次出發宣傳之前、曾發表一文、説明其宗旨、并提出對英要求十四條、茲從印報譯布如左、</p>
<p>「在多年祈禱及多年誠懇慮此問題之後、余已勸吿我同胞、於吾人爭獨立之奮鬥中、用不合作之法以反抗英人、但余同時力圖求得一種方案、俾依此方案、可得充分之規定、避免再有巧拉事件發生、致引起猛烈之舉動擾亂、（按甘地所指巧利巧拉事件、發生於一九二二年甘地提倡非武力不合作運動之時、巧利巧拉係印度合衆省之一村、是年二月一號、甘地所屬義勇隊團糾察一市集、被警吏所阻、同月四號、市集復開、義勇隊襲擊警署、放火焚燒、署中人員、除工人外、悉遭　斃、并焚其屍、綜計警察及保甲被殺者二四人、此事出後、甘地持餓齊五日、以資懺悔、對人言、彼認此爲上帝對於不合作運動實施太早之一種警誡、并爲彼之奇恥大辱云、）</p>
<p>預想將來印度與英國以武力相見之時、或終不免其來、印度如背牆而立、難可覓得一有效而無弊之方案、在今日之形勢、以印度國民大會之名、而行不合作運動、或不可能、不必印度國民大會之正式參加、而行個人的不合作運動、或爲必要、兩者均不可知、蓋今日印度之一切、尙在胚胎狀態中、然依現狀、印度國民大會若參加於所擬議之印度諸領袖與；英總督間之會議、則有害益、可斷言、</p>
<p>欲印度國民大會參加於此會議、則至少須有一條件、此余敢言者、即英政府須預先聲明、此會議不談鞭他計畫、而專談使印度獨立之切實計畫、同時履行適宜於此項會議之條件、如是則國民會議之諸領袖、將樂於鄕應、</p>
<p>此種會議必有其產生之因缘、或出於英國之善意、或出界與論之壓迫、或出於吾人方面之壓迫、而吾人希望其出於吾人之壓迫、苟吾人能發展充分之力量、則可得此結果、其時機成熟之遲早、全在吾人之自爲、</p>
<p>余更贊助否認某種印度國債之主張、須知前之以印度權利讓渡於外人、完全不計印度之國民利益、此乃人人所知、則此等國債安能期望、又安敢期藉口所謂旣得權利之濫調、而要求一獨立和印度之承認耶、</p>
<p>英國報紙及吾人之英人主治者肆言恫嚇、謂吾人之不合作運動者、與武力的反抗者、皆將遭厲害之土報復、此乃徒然無益、蓋不合作運動者與武力反抗　者雖手叚不同、目的則一、均曾計算其代價、甘受苦痛、非威力所能懾伏也、</p>
<p>茲將余之計畫、記之於此、是可謂余之十四條、其内容與襄提出於李丁貴族（前印度總督）者同、今復提出於歐文貴族、（現任印督）願彼與英内閣自動實行之、</p>
<p>（一）完全禁酒、（二）羅比與鎊之比率、從一先令六便士减至一先令四便士’（三）</p>
<p>地税至少减百分之五十、歸立法議會管理、（四）廢止盬税、（五）軍費至少開始减數、或不及半數、藉减少税率相應、（七）對進口外布征保護主義之關税、（八）</p>
<p>通過沿海公地條例、（九）釋放政治犯、但犯殺人或企圖殺人罪者除外、（十）撤回一切政治上之控吿、（十一）廢止刑律中之煽亂部分、一九一八年條例等、（十二）准許一切驅逐去國之印人回印、（十三）撤除刑事檢查科、或歸公家管理之、（十四）發給自衛用火器之執照、歸公家管理之、</p>
<p>以上不過最急迫需要之事項、此外應興</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>應革、難以枚舉、今姑請總督滿足印度此等極簡單急迫之需要、果總督能允此等要求者、則不合作運動之主張可止息、國民大會對於凡可由發表意見提出要求之任何會議、亦樂於參加矣、」</p>

<p>▲華輪已先復班</p>
<p>太古怡利日清捷江等各外輪、因長江上游領港要求增薪、便同盟停航、使川河交通阻斷、更欲令各領　受經濟壓迫之恐慌、自動打消加薪之請求、同時又通令我華商、亦一致加入、以遂其壟斷上游航權之計、茲經各華商窺破其用意、不受其利用、已各恢復營業、亟將此事詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>▲領江增薪條件　我國各路領港、惟川　　河全用國人、其任職在太古·怡和·日清·捷江·等各洋商輪船者、薪水分一二三等歷來受洋商不平等待遇、轉不及中國船所給者爲大、而且壓制升級、致各領港以所受之痛苦已深、遂於上月下旬、提出增薪條件、計二二等領港請加五成、三等領港請加四成、須逐年遞增、一等領港以加至五百元爲度、二等加至四百元爲度、三等加至二百元爲度、而每月一二三等領港須各給伙食费五十元·四十元·三十元、乃太古日清等立主拒絶接受、並將上江各輪全部停開、表示無妥協餘地、而川河交通乃斷、</p>
<p>▲華輪全部復航　各領港　提出條件後、對中國輪公司、表明此回行動、純係對外要求、謀得一生活上之保障、惟各外輪同盟停航時、曾命上游十一家華商輪、亦責令一律停班、經各華商拒絶簽字、而英日商即目爲破壞同業、向上海各總行辦交涉、經各公司婉言謝絶、從本月一日起、三北·渝江·等各輪公司、以維持川漢滬商運起見、對領港方面、每人認加給火食費三十元、照常服職、自三號起、華商輪吳興·渝江·九江·合江·萬安·定遠·等六船、已先復行、川滬交通已復、上海運川貨、亦可裝往矣、</p>
<p>▲捷江各輪亦開　當華輪開行之始、宜昌海關洋員、曾代英日航商張目、禁止華輪運貨、後經華商抗議乃止、美商捷江公司、在上江有六輪、鑒于中國船之開班、該行亦單獨承認領港之要求、每个人分等級、各加薪金三十元、又各貼伙食三十元、故亦于前日起、照常復航矣、惟太古怡和日清等三家、仍堅不允增薪、寗可受停業之犧牲、不肯接收條件、查該三公司、現在共有十八輪停班矣、</p>
<p>▲派兵駐船護航　宜昌上游近來匪徒蜂起、截刦商輪、已數見不鮮、今次各華輪復業、爲保護往來之安全計、除裝避彈鋼武板外、特公請二十軍郭汝棟部、每船派武裝兵士十二名駐船随護、以防亂匪襲撃云、</p>
<p>▲營業清衰减價　近來雖外輪停班、船舶减少、但川中客帮、以時局紛亂、多不敢辦貨、以致上下貨均缺乏、運川貨中、以棉紗爲最多、近日各輪公司、擬將運紗水脚再跌、每件自八兩减至六兩、業在會商中、不久可以實行矣、</p>

<p>流光如駛、大會開幕後、昨日已爲第五日、而天氣放晴、春意濃郁、又爲舊節清明、是觀衆較往日爲多、節目中全能運動、有十一項之多、球類均係次賽　故各塲看座、均無隙地　每當各塲競賽激烈之時、拍掌喝好、歡聲雷動、各運動員均精神百倍、尤以各球塲戰門最烈、除各項成績專欘紀載外、茲將會塲消息、分誌如下、</p>
<p>▲秩序整肅</p>
<p>大會秩序、連日加以整頓、故愈見愼密、各出口仍由軍警邏守、會塲外之四週馬路、由公安局警察、指揮交通、維持秩序、塲内各運動塲、由鹽務中學第一團黨章軍負責維持、並會同市立病院司救護之責、各塲秩序得以并然、</p>
<p>▲交通便捷</p>
<p>大會交通、除各處可以人力車直逹外、城站新市塲兩處、並由公路局特放專車、以載乘客、昨間費用、均甚經濟、自城站之大會、僅需洋角半、新市塲至大會一角、每十分鐘開行一次、每次往返、乘客滿座、</p>
<p>▲參觀團體</p>

<p>▲大有錦標希望</p>
<p>▲遼寗已獲十分</p>
<p>五日全能運動各團體得分滬十二分、遼十分、湘粤各四分、東特北平各二分、預料全能錦標、滬最有希望、但按昨十項前半部成績、遼張齡住第一、得二五零五分、遼蕭鼎華第二、得二三一五分、滬曹裕第三、得二二三七分、滬　明第四、得二二三二分、倘今結果亦二席仍屬遼、而八百米接力、滬隊不獲冠軍、則全能錦標、又將發生問題、</p>

<p>錦標在逐鹿中</p>
<p>棒球競賽中、以上海天津香港最有希望、鼎足三立、將來錦標未知鹿死誰手、最近形勢、香港於初複賽中、因江西北平均未派隊參加、不勞而獲决賽之權、同時上海以十一比零勝湖南、與天津以湖北隊未到之故、均獲複賽、定於今日下午二時比賽、勝利之一隊將於八日與香港决賽、定本届錦標、上海對於此項錦標、抱破釜沉舟之志、健將劉逹成羅觀祥决來參加云、</p>

<p>第三湖南：：：：第四東特</p>
<p>昨日下午二時男子千六百米替換跑决賽、與賽者僅上海遼寗湖南東特四隊、天津北平廣東浙江各隊、均未出塲、聞天津隊因連日運動，過疲、且預備參加今日之八百米替換賽、故未加入、觀衆最注目者、爲上海遼寗二隊、蓋實力等、究不知鹿死誰手也、滬隊陣線以朱瑞洪跑第一圏何德寳跑第二圏、蘇祖卿跑第三圏、王建吾殿軍、遼隊陣線、以蔡芳圃跑第一顧世榮跑第二圏郎大奎第三圏　短跑怪傑劉長春殿軍、</p>
<p>▲滬隊佔先</p>
<p>槍聲起處、遼寗蔡芳圃健步衝出、領導前進、上海朱瑞洪第二、東特第三、湖南第四、至半圏時、朱瑞洪追趧甚力、與蔡相距約一米、至三百米時、朱蔡已並駕齊驅、最後朱竟獲第一、遼蔡第二、　相距約數步、東特仍第三、湖南第四、</p>
<p>▲相距三米</p>
<p>第二圏中、滬隊何德寳努力衝跑、遼隊世榮緊緊相隨、二人均能維持固有位置、但至最后之半圏中、何德寳較龐稍優、第一第二距離、已有三米之隔、東特第三、湖南第四、</p>
<p>▲第三圈中</p>
<p>至第三圈時、滬隊蘇祖卿益爲奮勇、遼隊郎大奎亦不示弱、拼命相追、卒以接棒時、滬隊較速、至是相距更遠、逹終點時、第一第二相距約五米、均以爲滬隊之得冠軍、毫無疑義、遼寗雖狠、莫可染指矣、不料結果、殊有出人意料者、</p>
<p>▲怪傑施威</p>
<p>第四圏中　滬隊王健吾知勁敵在后、非特别努、不足以竟全功、奮門殊力、但遼隊殿軍怪傑劉長春、持棒猛進疾如奔馬、跑至二百時、相距僅三米、跑坙三百米、滬遼已相並、三百二十米、時、完全追出、一片鼓掌聲震動耳鼓、至終點時、劉長春與王健吾、相距約三米、造成三分四十二秒五分新紀錄、（按全國紀錄爲三分四十五秒五分之二）遼隊之獲冠軍者、完全怪傑之力、非怪傑亦不能超出王健吾之七八米也、時湖南亦追出　東特得第三、東特第四、</p>

<p>（二）廣東戰勝江西</p>
<p>▲十二與○之比</p>
<p>▲獲勝頗容易</p>
<p>▲上海與湖北之戰</p>
<p>上海隊濟濟多士、稱雄滬濱、已非一年、其球工藝之優良、全國人士、有口皆碑、無須記者之介紹、湖北隊技術平凡、以新成之軍、當被百戰之師、其不敗者幾希矣、觀昨日之戰、湖北隊自始至終、努力奮門、絶不以失敗而灰心、看定比賽爲切磋技術之機會、此種精神、實爲運動界所不可多得、該隊亦足以自慰矣、湖北隊其勉旃</p>
<h3 id="c156">上海獲球太多 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>下午時、二隊開始接觸、上海隊步步爲營、湖北隊陣容非常散漫、故致一落千丈、開始時湖北隊尙能維持、惟以後上海　隊鋒芒漸露、湖北隊乃益形落後、鬥志全無招架尙難、遑論還兵、上海隊以所勝已多、隨便周旋、故入後形勢鬆懈、無精采足述、觀衆未及濱畢、早陸續星散矣、</p>

<p>上半時競爭頗烈、上海第一球在開賽後五分鐘時、由右童榮文打進、第二球爲王雍劼射中、第三球爲符和萱傳中、童榮文衝入、上半時遂爲三與零、易陣後、戰約三分鐘、陳家球打進一球、上海隊連取四球後、湖北隊方開記錄、此球爲湖北隊右内鋒乘上海内鋒疏怱時打入、第五球由陳家球踼進、童郁文打進第六球第七第八第九三只、均爲陳家球連續射進、此二球中、首先一球係得力於童榮文之傳遞、後兩球則爲中三人互相恊助之力、結果遂成九比一、裁判員樂秀榮、</p>

<p>▲廣東與江西之役</p>
<p>廣東足球隊昨以十二與○之比戰勝江西、此爲足球次賽第二日之第一幕、廣東全隊平均、攻守俱佳、江西隊則中衛較優、前鋒少合作傳遞、實爲該隊致敗之根由、兩軍陣容如左、</p>
<p>險象又臨、陳光耀得中鋒之助、在人業中射進一球、右翼高爲跌下盤進一球、廣東聲勢大盛、最後又連續攻進四球、上半小時　　的與○、</p>
<p>▲下半時</p>
<p>戰事再起、廣東健兒、益吿奮勇、傳送巧妙、前後呼應、陳光耀遠射一球、左内鋒飛步捏上、一舉</p>

<p>足砰然一聲、球已入門、又建功續、江西奮勇有爲五分鐘後、陳光耀又以中的聞、江西隊此時、陣線愈鬆懈、前鋒旣志不得逞後、方亦無從佈防、廣東節深入、江西門前、四面楚歌、成爲衆矢之的、一轉瞬間又負一球、是球由陳耀傳中、左内鋒莊甲民射進、江西至此、乃奮發精神努力反攻、奈廣東内衛桿衛有方、每能化險爲貴無懶可擊、已而江西内衛以手觸球、被罰十二　、陳光主踢又進、廣東再接再厲、最後五分鐘、又射進兩球、總結果十二對零、廣東勝、裁判員何春輝、</p>

<p>與江蘇相遇於第二遇賽中、江蘇實力、亦頗不弱戰其能以四十對二十七戰勝頑强之廣東、軍容整齊、可以想見、十二時後、球塲四週之看台、已無處嚴、短欄四傍、站立觀者、不下千餘人、熱閙情形、問此次籃球塲未有新紀錄　　▲天津首先得勢</p>
<p>笛聲起處兩隊健兒、疾步飛奔、天津首先得勢、魏蓬雲縱之、又未能如願以償、江蘇見風勢不佳、竭力防範、内衛任星傑觀得對方傳球、正擬大擊反攻、奈天津用五人聯防法、圍得鐵　相似、各路不通、江蘇不能進攻、乃在自已地盤内傳遞、引誘對方出戰、即乘隙而入、奈天津無論如何不爲稍動、各守防地、母稍鬆懈、</p>
<p>▲江蘇防禦嚴密</p>
<p>未幾江蘇犯規受罰天津得二分、江蘇趙從衍亦得一分、成二與一之比相持十分鐘之久、天津又大得其勢、鐵閘李國琛王錫良、濳入敵地、屢　建奇功、上半時結果、僅十一對四、比數之接近、</p>
<p>可見江蘇防禦之嚴密、</p>
<p>▲易地再戰　天津改變戰略、陣線更動、姚恩漢代魏蓬雲、姚勇猛過人軍心爲之一振、寳堃出没籃下、捉摸無定、得分獨多、江蘇後禦任傑星救出險球不少、趙從衍亦多可取之點、惟全隊聯絡功夫、未及天津之精深耳、結果、爲三十四與十三之比、天津獲勝、</p>

<p>兩隊實力、可稱旗鼓相當、槍聲起處、但粤佔首位、至第三跑畢時、粤與東特相距約二米、粤仍爲第一、經孫桂雲努力追趕、逹終點時、幾將劉有慶趕上裁判員亦無從分别第一第二、遂議决定今日下午一時、東特區廣東重賽一次、規定第一第二、查女子田徑成績除二百米替換賽外、第一爲廣東共二十分第二爲東特區共十七分、替換賽規定第一十分第二六分、第三四分第四二分、倘今日東特得第一、則總分爲二十七分、廣東得第二、則總分爲二十六分、相差一分、東特區得女田徑錦標　否則即被廣東所得、故今日二百米替換賽、關係之重大、實非等間、想二隊定有一番極激烈之競爭也、至第三昨已定爲湖北、第四爲遼寗、不重賽、東特區代表曾向裁判員提出交涉、認東特區爲第一、不允重賽云、</p>
<p>女二百米替換賽東特粤並行第一、東特不服裁判交涉頗久、經戴季陶調解、始允今日續賽、</p>

<p>▲二與○之比</p>
<p>▲粤隊前線佳</p>
<p>五日上午九時、粤蘇相遇於次賽、廣東隊久負盛名、在此次錦標比賽中、亦具有冠軍之資格、而蘇隊这隊員、完全爲華南之人士、對於此道、素所擅長、實力亦頗不弱、但與廣東相較、尚覺稍邂一籌、由昨賽形勢之觀察、粤隊前二排陣綫、組織非常嚴密、進攻之力甚强、惟後排防絮較差、蘇隊之得分、往往因能命中後方而得手、當開始遂鹿之際、粤隊來勢洵洵、銳不可當、陳從超發球、連得八分之多、蘇隊爲之威攝、以後戰爭、極形劇烈、蘇隊亦間有所獲、上半局粤先以十一比二佔優、易陣後、蘇隊併力反攻、曾爭得六比十二之局面、粤見形勢不佳、即速振作精神、托壓極見精彩、壓擊之球、多能隨心應手、乘虚而入、觀其高壓方法、恒俟球高於網不及一尺時、即飛虫力擊、故球落迅而有力、成一斜直綫、使對方最難救護、足爲粤隊取勝之要訣、因此連佔勝利、以二十一比十二勝得第一局、續賽中、粤隊乘勝進取、再接再厲、江蘇更形不支、未幾、又以二十一比二獲勝、結果二比○裁判員吳邦偉、二隊陣綫列左、</p>

<p>東特四女士</p>
<p>昨日二百米女子替換賽跑、哈爾濱方面、爲孫桂雲·劉靜貞·王淵·吳梅仙四女士　茲將其小史分述於後、</p>
<p>孫桂雲女士、山東人、十六歲、劉靜貞女士、吉林人、年一十歲、王淵女士、江蘇吳江縣人、年十六歲、吳梅仙女士、江蘇宜興縣人、四女士幼即友好、感情綦篤、始僅相共、切磋學問　課餘偶作戶</p>
<p>外運動耳、及民十七年、結伴赴奉參觀東省聯合運動會、因自稔缺之經騐、未敢參加、及見會場内之女子田徑賽成績、亦無轉殊紀錄、遂以來賓參加、而競賽之結果、各項成績、實超以前女子之各項紀錄、　名擂三省　退而練習益勤、先後加入特區聯合會、亦負盛名、孫女士且以個人得田徑賽轉分第一、并學校總分第一、去歲又加入華北運動會、以孫女士之努力　本可獲總分第一惟以報名之際、手續不符、致减十分、勉列第二、又加入中日德三國之運動會　孫女士輿日人賽、日選手以百米十二秒打破世界紀錄、孫女士亦以十三秒七獲第三、實開我國女子運動史之新紀元、平日女士聯袂運動、終年不　每黎明即起　苦志精研、課暇無肯稍耗、　刻、故能獲有如此成績、孫女士芳齡尙幼、體力未充　已能若此、將來再精進努力、定能執吾國女子田徑賽牛耳、至如劉王吳三女士、亦均可造之材、與孫女士可謂相得益彰、勉之哉、</p>
<h3 id="c181">花花絮絮 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>▲努力前程</p>
<p>江西選手、因田徑賽連日失利、籃球敗於津、排球又隙於浙　故該隊以無其他紀錄、一部分業於昨日離杭返贛矣、</p>
<p>▲始終如一</p>
<p>萬米賽跑、最後者爲浙江寗波第四中學邵文龍在衆人跑完之後、邵君尙有兩圈米跑、此時廣塲中、萬目睽睽任彼一人獨跑、而邵君意態自若從容遇進、卒逹終點、會長戴季陶氏當萬米賽至中途時即聲言、如有能始終跑完、雖最後一人、個人當以獎贈品以爲始終如一者勉、</p>
<p>▲女子厄運</p>
<p>男子運動時期、除臨塲外傷及内症外、任何時間都有運動之可能、獨女運動員當因天癸突至苟强迫其運動、其受創或十倍於天然疾病、此次大會各省市參加之女運動員、竟有因天癸而臨塲未能參加、或因處境而强迫運動、致其成績多數落伍、是誠女運動員之厄運也、</p>
<p>▲害人不淺</p>
<p>女子短跑飛將軍孫桂雲、自獲得五十百米决賽第一後、一般同行健兒、咸向之致賀、並要求請客、孫女士亦自喜氣洋洋、卒允所請、昨果大請其客、一時傳開、健兒咸知、凡獲第一者、羣向要求、例須請客、甚之獲得第二第三者、亦不能免　故會塲健兒往還、一片請客之聲、到處可聞、獲中者謂孫桂雲害人不淺、</p>
<h3 id="c182">一萬米起賽之情形　王開攝 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>▲孫小姐洒淚</p>
<p>昨日女子二百米接力賽跑、裁判員忽宣吿第一二名不分、廣東與哈爾濱等、今日須重賽、孫桂雲女士　聞之下、急得淚流滿面、只喊「氣死我了」、不頋再賽、晚間聞亦未進膳、一般人頗爲担憂、蓋女士已一哭二餓、深恐做到其他步驟、裁判員担不了這大責任了、</p>
<p>▲松節油奇效</p>
<p>哈爾濱選手孫桂雲女士、風頭出足、閲者只知成績超然、尙不知其來有自、蓋女士第一次出塲時、　黄警頑爲其兩腿上塗松節油、呆、果獲第一、感謝黄氏不置、以後每次必照例請黄氏塗油、而歷騐不爽、黄氏等前同後、效勞周至、且自詡爲女士塗油有效、爲無上榮幸、年來在交際場中以此事爲最愉快云、</p>
<p>▲也來玩套</p>
<p>昨日午第一次足球賽下半小時開始時、江西陣也　忽來黄色之狗、隨球追逐、左右奔馳、一般球員之前進、遂致大爲阻礙、一時鼓掌之聲、震動全埸、</p>
<p>▲騎牆派心理</p>
<p>會場内各分場　有相通者、有隔絶者、凡隔絶之場、非購總票者、不能通行、須另行購票、但各場坐台上之最高級從甲場可望到乙場、巧者多以爭得此項位置爲快、可以一舉兩得、據　筋　敏者之推測、此種人心理作用、多屬於騎牆派者、</p>

<p>大會開幕時。國府要人畢集。如蔣主席戴傳賢褚民誼吳稚老等。各有演詞。而以蔣主席演詞尤爲懇切。一再陳述。聲如洪鐘。至力竭聲嘶而止。足見其重視本會使命也。各選手咸爲動容。神户遼寗之遠道參加者。亦鼓掌深表歡迎云。</p>
<p>全體女選手中。皆剪髮挺胸。惟遼寗一女子。獨垂一辮。爲衆人注目。稱全塲怪傑。</p>
<p>塲中有小販兜售紙杯冰淇淋者。當此春寒料峭之際。諸選手力疲之餘。如痛飲幾杯。恐易致疾。似於衛生不合。深願當局有以改善之也。</p>
<p>女子選手。雌威懔懔。不讓鬚眉。預料結果必不惡。而田徑賽中。哈爾濱王淵最有希望。蓋預選已一再獲得錦標矣。姑拭目以觀其後。</p>
<p>往來公共汽車。可直逹會門。且取價亦廉。惟第一日因預備夜間在大禮堂歡迎全體選手。故多輛汽車。留不載客。一般非健兒。皆呌苦連天矣。</p>
<p>杭市商業。今年於香市之外。特來大批旅客。無不欣然色喜。均謂黨治後之好現象。博覽會後。此其第二次盛會矣。</p>
<p>塲中除男女健兒各獻好身手外。奔走最忙者。當推一般攝影記者。一聲開槍。即爭先恐後。爲第一二名攝影片。快郵分投滬報。其熱心勇敢。至足欽偑云。</p>

<p>曩偕友人游常熟之虞山。或問余曰。虞山又稱牛山。子亦嘗聞之乎。余曰。孟子言牛之木嘗美矣。此齊國之山。當在今山東省。常熟虞山。不聞亦有是名也。或又曰。有之。虞山以仲名。牛山則言其形象也。牛頭則言子墳也。牛角則辛峰方塔也。牛後則老石洞也。又有牛尾。爲秦皇一鞭擊斷。今遺蹟猶存。是牛龐大。乃指常熟一城。爲飯牛之桶。其語絕類滑稽。常熟士人。類能言之。余聞是言。未之敢信。後見崑山胡石予先生有虞山謠一首。蓋紀游詩。油印以示友人者。虞山謠其一也。讀之可與上述相證印。詩云。虞山雖小名寰區。幾曾聞以牛易虞。今乘筍輿繞山行。輿人喋喋乃聒余。其言離奇本不經姑妄言之姑妄聽。云此山以形名牛。牛頭高墳言子游。一城承之飯牛桶。辛峯方塔雙角聳。牛後出矢老石洞。尻下忽斷應負痛。在昔秦帝始皇氏。驅牛西湖牛不起。（尙湖亦號西湖）舉鞭大吼力千鈞。直下一擊斷其尾。其尾稍遠一小邱。至今没入荒榛裏。盍往觀之吾言信。前行不過一二里。齊東野人語殊妙。余亦謾言幾失笑。琴川七水風冷冷。日對牛兮彈古調。</p>

<p>第十回　赤燄鰧天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>那齣不如歸中。這個扮演主角浪子夫人的人最緊的。不是説他們青柳社中。有兩個善於扮演妙龄女郎的。一位姜小霞。一位歐雨青嗎。可是姜小霞此刻還在日本。没有回國。他是學美術的。有志於到法蘭西一行。法國是歐洲美術的源泉。他要預備他們的美術專門學校。就是眼睛裹多看看。也增長智識不少。歐雨青却是回國以後。還家鄕去了。原來他是湖南瀏陽縣人。在戊戍政變的時候。瀏陽出過了兩位烈士。一位譚瀏陽。一位唐瀏陽。人傑地靈。把小小的瀏陽也出了名了。歐雨青的父親。也是仕途中人。他也是個世家子弟。回國以後。不能不回鄕省親一次。所以也不在上海。可是這齣不如歸中扮演浪子的。却已經有了一位特定人物。此人姓馬號絳友。要論起姿容扮相來。那馬絳友不及姜小霞歐雨青兩人。可是他有個特點。因爲他善於演悲劇。並且那不如歸中的女主人浪子是有很深的肺病的。馬絳友也有很深的肺病。他的一隻面孔。天然的帶着蒼白而没有血色。連化妝都用不着化妝。自然而然的一副肺癆病的面龐。因此他做這齣戲中的女主角。最爲合適。就只他的聲音。不大尖俏。微帶一點哭音。在别齣戲固然很不相宜。在這齣悲劇中。却没有大碍。他在東京同學演劇的時候。表演過一次。很得着好評。他們現在到了上海。所以選擇了表演這一齣不如歸。也是因爲姜小霞和歐雨青都不在上海。只有馬絳友在這裏。所以選定這戲。其次便商量到地點問題。那時候上海所謂改良戲劇之聲。囂然塵上。他們稱那班没有鑼鼓絲竹的白話劇。謂之文明戲。又謂之文明新戲。這上頭加上文明兩字。可見那舊戲是不大文明的了。但是從一般略有知識的人眼光看來。所謂文明戲者。也文明得有限。不拘麽人。一點没有習練。跳上台去。就亂喊亂跳。懂得一點皮毛的人。對於觀衆們就是一場演説。好像是敎訓人家一般。其餘的就是前言不搭後語。連他自已也不明戲情。也不知道到底是怎麽一回事。。像那種戲院。上海不是没有。。也有什麽種種的布景。更有旋轉的戲台。他們往往用「大轉舞台」登出大字的廣吿來。要想推動一班太太小姐們來看。</p>

<h3 id="e2">National Government Orders Punishment of Yan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Usurping a Province Without Achievements</p>
<p>Insidious and Cunning, Insatiable in Extortion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sixth hour after the 5th, the government order is as follows: The rebel Yan Xishan has always been cunning and deceitful. During the Xinhai Revolution, he encountered a favorable opportunity and usurped a province without achieving anything. Even though Yuan Shikai did not tolerate him, the Premier still supported him to secure his position. When Yuan Shikai betrayed the country, this rebel harbored desires for wealth and power, turning against his benefactor to serve the enemy. He first declared his withdrawal from the Kuomintang party membership, and then requested the dissolution of the Kuomintang in order to curry favor with Yuan Shikai. When Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, this rebel took the lead in urging him to advance and requested the establishment of the Hongxian Empire. He was praised and rewarded by Yuan Shikai, and thus received the false title of First Class Marquis, which this rebel accepted without shame. He has long been unfit to be a citizen of the Republic of China. When the parliament was dissolved, the military governors revolted, and Zhang Xun restored the monarchy, this rebel equivocated, believing that those who could serve Hongxian could also serve Puyi as emperor. At that time, the Premier raised troops to suppress the rebels. All messengers traveling to and from Shanxi were rejected. Therefore, throughout the Premier's life, there was no record of this rebel assisting the revolution. Instead, he celebrated its downfall. When our National Revolutionary Army advanced to the Huai and Ji rivers, this rebel finally surrendered. The government, with its magnanimity, forgave his crimes and valued his potential. It intended to use his talents as a lackey, believing his claws and teeth could be useful, and thus granted him the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Not only did he achieve nothing, but he was also insatiable in his extortion. Last year, the chaos of Li, Bai, Feng, and Tang was largely instigated by this rebel in secret. On one hand, he secretly requested the government to denounce and punish Feng. On the other hand, he secretly allied with Feng to threaten the government. All sorts of insidious and cunning schemes were concentrated in this rebel. Recently, he has also gathered various anti-revolutionary military personnel and politicians to attempt to make a final stand. The government follows the late Premier's teachings and promotes political construction. Now that this rebel is disrupting party discipline and creating national difficulties, why should we continue to tolerate and nurture him, waiting for a suitable time? What about the party? What about the country? Yan Xishan should be immediately removed from all his current positions. All government authorities and armies, both inside and outside the capital, should strictly apprehend him and bring him to justice, in order to warn the treacherous and uphold the law. This is the order. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Disarmament and the Air Force <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The only effective weapon in future world wars, as everyone knows, is the airplane of the air force. The navy and army will retreat to auxiliary roles. Therefore, if we sincerely hope to achieve peace, we should especially restrict the air force. After the Great War, the European countries, in the Treaty of Versailles, stipulated that the construction and purchase of all aircraft should be prohibited within a certain period, and most of the aircraft fields should also be destroyed. At that time, they already knew that airplanes were very harmful to war. However, after a long period of negotiation, they agreed to cancel the previous agreement. Since then, the defeated countries, having recovered their vitality, have devoted themselves to competing to build military fighter aircraft, while the victorious countries have urgently expanded their efforts. Therefore, the progress of the air force is advancing rapidly, which is truly alarming. Yesterday's American dispatch said that 160 airplanes of the U.S. Army Air Corps were conducting exercises in the air. The scale of the exercise was unprecedented on the Pacific coast. In the near future, there will be a grand air defense exercise in various ports of the Pacific Ocean. The spectacle will far exceed today's event. Today's Japanese dispatch stated that the Japanese Navy intends to request the government to spend 60 million yuan over five years to increase the number of naval standing aircraft to 1,000 in order to make up for the reduction in military strength after this disarmament and maintain equal strength with the United States. Against the backdrop of the establishment of this Anglo-American-Japanese agreement, they are either demonstrating with the air force or urgently increasing air force strength to show confrontation. This kind of news cannot but make people feel surprised. The meaning of disarmament is to reduce one's own fighting power in order to show the sincere belief that one does not want to attack others. Limiting naval shipbuilding is only one way to reduce fighting power. It will naturally extend from the navy to the army and air force, gradually achieving the purpose of disarmament. If, on the naval front, competition in shipbuilding is limited, while the army and air force still freely compete to expand, as if it has nothing to do with disarmament, then the purpose of disarmament will be largely defeated. At the London Naval Conference, with great difficulty, the United States and Japan initially had hopes for compromise. However, observing the competition in the air force like this, wouldn't the result of the compromise be almost zero? The League of Nations, originally scheduled to convene a preparatory meeting for the reduction of naval, land, and air forces in Geneva in mid-June, will now, according to telegrams, be postponed. This can also give us a glimpse into the future trend of disarmament.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Jiang Sends Telegram to Soldiers Nationwide <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Success or Failure Determined by Right and Wrong</p>
<p>Fortune or Misfortune Determined by Obedience and Rebellion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang sent a telegram to the soldiers nationwide on the 5th: (Titles omitted) All of you should be aware that what China urgently needs at present is unity and peace. What the central government has consistently strived to achieve is also unity and peace. Therefore, all those who love the country and obey the central government should support the policy of unity and peace and promote its realization. However, the rebels Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang harbor feudal mentalities and have the ingrained habits of warlords. They deeply fear that unity will be detrimental to their ambition to carve out territory, and peace will eliminate their opportunities to create chaos. Therefore, they have painstakingly tried to undermine unity and disrupt peace. Yan Xishan is cunning and treacherous at heart, and his nature is sinister. He always wants to sacrifice others while placing himself in an invulnerable position. Although he outwardly shows obedience to the central government, he instigates rebellions in the local areas, engaging in manipulation and sowing discord by any means possible. In the past year, successive rebellions, from the Guangxi warlords' rebellion to Tang Shengzhi's rebellion, have all been instigated by Yan Xishan. The facts are there for all to see. The central government has been patient and accommodating, showing leniency and tolerance in the hope that they would repent and open a path for self-renewal. However, they have acted recklessly and become increasingly lawless. Recently, because the counter-revolutionary warlords they manipulated and utilized have been gradually pacified, they have been driven to desperation and are willing to brazenly engage in rebellion, usurp false titles, and harbor traitors in an attempt to make a final struggle. As for Feng Yuxiang, he has repeatedly defected and rebelled, narrowly escaping punishment, and his wanted status is still in effect. His wild nature has resurfaced, and this time he is protected by Yan Xishan and attempting to revive himself. He is gathering troops in Tongguan and invading Zhengzhou and Luoyang, joining forces with Yan Xishan to engage in counter-revolution. Such willful wickedness is unforgivable. In order to implement the policy of unity and peace and maintain faith in human relations, the central government has reluctantly sent troops to suppress the Guangxi and Tang Shengzhi reactionary warlords. Since the Guangxi and Tang Shengzhi reactionary warlords have been eliminated in the past due to rebellion, will Yan and Feng be exempt from destruction due to rebellion? Success or failure is determined by right and wrong, and fortune or misfortune is determined by obedience and rebellion. Zhong Zheng has repeatedly proclaimed this to our soldiers in successive campaigns to suppress rebellion. Past facts have also proven that those who are right succeed and those who are wrong fail; those who are obedient prosper and those who are rebellious suffer. Yan and Feng's rebellion cannot escape the common law of success, failure, fortune, and misfortune. Furthermore, Yan and Feng's current rebellion, on the one hand, is recruiting politicians from all factions, from the Anfu Clique to the Reorganization Clique, to bolster their power. On the other hand, they are coercing the Northwest armies to serve as their sacrifices. The more they recruit, the more their unity weakens. It is clear that those who have different interests and different wills are included and tolerated. It is obvious that each will prioritize their own interests and wills. Conflicts of interest and differing wills will inevitably lead to discord. Our anti-rebellion armies take the survival of the party and the country as their own survival, the safety of the central government as their own safety, and the success or failure of the revolution as their own success or failure. Our interests are common, and we have long been trained in ideology, possessing the spirit and will of the revolution. Therefore, the anti-rebellion armies will be of one mind and united as one. The enemy is divided and lacks unity, while we are of one mind and united as one. Using an army of one mind to attack a crowd of discord, we will be able to defeat them one against ten, and a hundred against a thousand, and destroy the bandits as if crushing dry weeds. Therefore, as soon as the banner of righteousness against rebellion is raised, the overall victory or defeat has been decided. Yan and Feng's destruction can be counted. However, Zhong Zheng has something to tell our soldiers: The task of the anti-rebellion army is to suppress bandits and quell chaos. The purpose of suppressing bandits and quelling chaos is to save the people. Wherever the army goes, it should always have the heart to love the people and do things to defend the people. Discipline must be strict, and disturbances should be strictly prohibited. Do not allow social order to be disrupted by the army, and do not allow the security of the neighborhoods to be affected by the war. When fighting, actions must be swift and steps must be consistent. There must be detailed reports and reliable communication between the armies. If one army is in danger, other armies should rush to its aid. If one army attacks, other armies should advance together. Only in this way can we use the entire army to attack their rabble. All soldiers must know that this battle is the last struggle of the feudal warlords and also the last act of the revolutionary war. Let each be loyal, brave, and determined to destroy this dynasty and complete the revolutionary feat and lay the foundation for the country to be forever secure. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek.

<h3 id="e13">The Workers' Strike at the Heji Factory in Xiaguan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Situation Deteriorates</p>
<p>Students Demonstrate in Support of Workers</p>
<p>The Authorities Are Trying to Mediate</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The workers' strike at the Heji Factory in Xiaguan was mediated by the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and a treaty was signed by the union and the factory. All workers were to be employed with the consent of the factory through the introduction of the union. However, when the factory resumed work on the 3rd, it did not fulfill this treaty, causing a conflict between the workers who went to work and the unemployed workers. Several workers were injured at the time. After hearing the news, the schools in Beijing organized the "Fourth Third Incident Support Association" to express their support. On the morning of the 5th, the unemployed workers gathered again near the factory to hold meetings and give speeches, demonstrating to the factory. In the afternoon, more than 500 students from various schools in the city, each holding flags, lined up to leave the city to support the workers. They also gave speeches in front of Heji. The Westerners in charge of the factory, realizing that the situation was serious, intended to request Japanese sailors to land for protection. When the 11th Police Precinct heard the news, it immediately sent officers led by Shen Liqun to mediate. They invited student representatives and representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau to talk and jointly find a proper solution. The result of the conversation was that the incident was entirely caused by the factory's violation of the first provision of the resumption agreement. This provision stated that the workers used by the factory should be introduced by the union, and the worker's card issued by the factory should also be handled by the union. However, when work resumed, the factory gave the work method to the foreman for distribution. The foreman was able to manipulate this, causing most of the workers to lose their jobs and fight each other. This tragedy arose from this. The following solutions were decided: 1. Please ask student representatives to guide workers and students to stop all activities and wait for the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and student representatives to negotiate with the factory on the 6th. 2. Representatives should negotiate with the factory to ensure that the work permit is issued by the union. The student representatives then reported the process to the students and workers, who all agreed. They then formed a team and dispersed. When the students of the schools passed along the river bank, they saw a large number of Japanese warships parked in the river, and shouted slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism" and "Drive the Japanese warships out of the country." Because the police were suppressing them along the way, no incidents occurred. On the 5th, the police authorities, fearing incidents when students from various schools went to Xiaguan to support the unemployed workers of Heji, specifically instructed the 10th and 11th bureaus to send personnel to persuade the students. At 2:30 PM, when some students were traveling to Xingzhongmen, Wang Zuo, the patrolling officer, advised them in vain, causing a conflict. Wang was beaten and injured on the spot. At that time, the guards closed the city gate because of the disturbance. Later, when the chief of the 10th Bureau heard the news, he rushed to explain to the students in many ways before opening the city gate. The students also formed a team and went to Heji. The Ministry of Education received a report from Gu Shusen, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, at about 4 o'clock. Jiang Menglin immediately went to Xiaguan with the director of education to inspect. After returning to the ministry, he immediately summoned the universities to talk to the ministry. Except for Zhongda, all the principals arrived. Jiang personally instructed the schools to do their best to stop the students and not to have any more marching demonstrations. The government will have a proper solution to the Heji Foreign Company's labor strike in the shortest possible time. Please ask the principals to explain. The Municipal Education Bureau summoned the principals of public and private middle schools and made the same instructions. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Another Turning Point in Anglo-French Negotiations</p>
<p>Briand to Return to Paris Immediately</p>
<p>Agreement on the Outline of the Three-Power Accord Established</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Increase Naval Aviation</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th – The optimism of recent days regarding the Five-Power Naval Conference has largely vanished today. It is said that the atmosphere for a Three-Power Accord is very good, but there is not much hope for a Five-Power Accord. Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson will dine with French Foreign Minister Briand to discuss the French formula. The only hope for the Naval Conference rests on this. A British official spokesperson denied reports from Paris that the British had rejected the French formula and stated that the comments attributed to Italian Foreign Minister Grandi by newspapers were also inaccurate rumors. According to sources from the Italian delegation, Grandi recently stated in a conversation that the main problem facing the Naval Conference is disarmament, not politics. The Italian Foreign Minister has been away from Rome for eleven weeks, and there is a backlog of pressing matters to be dealt with, but the Italian Foreign Minister does not want to complicate matters, so he has not yet made preparations for departure. When asked about the Franco-Italian issues at the Naval Conference, a representative of the Italian side replied that it is no longer a question of Italy demanding equality, but rather a question of France demanding superiority.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th – It is reported that the U.S. delegation believes that a Five-Power Accord is hopeless and is scheduled to return to the U.S. by ship on April 22nd. The result of the Naval Conference will likely be a Three-Power Accord between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, as well as agreements on some minor issues among the five powers.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 5th – The Daily Mail reports that the Conservative Party is greatly alarmed by the continued discussions between British and French representatives on a formula to accommodate French demands arising from the Naval Conference. They will raise various questions to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on Monday. If the answers are not satisfactory, they will demand a debate. If the vote after the debate is unfavorable to the government, the government will resign. The Daily Express reports that the hope for success in the Anglo-French negotiations is very slim. Last night, French Foreign Minister Briand spoke with French Premier Tardieu in Paris via wireless telephone, and both concluded that the situation was hopeless.</p>
<p>▲Rengo, Tokyo, 5th – An agreement on the outline of negotiations between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan has been established. When a special committee decides to review Japan's reserved items, the Japanese plenipotentiary will again consult with the government regarding the form of the reservations, and the agreement will be established upon the government's approval. Regarding the form of the reservations, Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki intends to proceed with a unilateral statement, that is, a statement of not abandoning the 70% claim will be left in the minutes. Therefore, the imbalance between Japan and the United States after 1926 is not unconditionally recognized, and the United Kingdom and the United States recognize Japan's right to demand an appropriate ratio. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said that although the reserved items declared by Japan have no legal binding force, based on the private meetings held between the four plenipotentiaries Wakatsuki, Matsudaira, Stimson, and Reed, it can be seen that the United States has clearly recognized the substantial effect of Japan's reservations.</p>
<p>▲Rengo, Tokyo, 5th – In order to compensate for the deficiency in military strength after this disarmament, the Navy plans to increase the number of naval aircraft, which are always ready, by about 1,000 over five years, requesting the government to spend 60 million yuan. In this way, it will be possible to maintain equal power with the United States' air force.</p>
<p>▲Rengo, London, 4th – The general meeting of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan Special Committee was held at St. James's Palace at 5:00 PM on the 4th. The Japanese committee explained the number of light cruisers and destroyers built to replace the old ships during the effective period of the treaty, as well as the number built each year, the year of commencement, the year of completion, and the method of decommissioning old ships. The United Kingdom and the United States indicated that these complex figures needed further study, and it was decided to reconvene at 3:00 PM on the 7th. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – It is reported that the Navy Ministry is now discussing a request to transfer a portion of the funds saved due to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan Naval Agreement to expand the naval aviation corps, increasing it from the current 17 squadrons to 28 squadrons, totaling about 1,000 aircraft, requiring 60 million Japanese yen to compensate for the losses suffered in national defense due to the reduction in submarine tonnage. Well-informed sources believe that this statement is based on the expectations of knowledgeable individuals. However, the Prime Minister stated to the press today that the government has not yet considered any proposals of this nature, but the Vice Minister of the Navy did suggest using a portion of the funds saved by the Three-Power Agreement to increase the strength of naval weapons. It is now generally believed that if an agreement can be signed, more than 10 million Japanese yen can be saved annually, most of which will be used to reduce taxes and relieve unemployment, and the surplus funds may be used to increase the naval air defenses.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 5th – French Foreign Minister Briand stated this morning after meeting with British Prime Minister MacDonald and British Foreign Secretary Henderson at St. James's Palace that the views of the British and French governments are now closer than before, and great progress has been made this morning. Briand is scheduled to return to Paris this afternoon and will return to London next Tuesday.</p>

<p>To Implement the Anti-Salt Tax Movement</p>
<p>The Anti-Revolutionary Party Requests a Postponement</p>
<p>A Team of Armed Police Arrives Near the Coast</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Bombay, 5th – Gandhi and others have arrived in Dandi. Representatives of the All-India Anti-Revolutionary Party have also arrived in Dandi, intending to request Gandhi to postpone the anti-salt tax movement and instead focus on opposing the injustices against Hindu followers. The Bombay Textile Merchants Association has decided not to buy foreign cloth for the next three months.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Calcutta, 5th – This morning, the Swaraj Party newspaper made no mention of the armed resistance scheduled to begin tomorrow. The headline reads, "Eve of the Struggle." Calcutta's focal point for this movement will be in Contai, a coastal town where hundreds of people will be making salt. A meeting was held here yesterday, chaired by Mayor Sangputa, which passed a motion against the police's abuse of firearms against livestock haulers on the Howrah Bridge on Tuesday, and urged trade unions to prepare for a general strike.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>▲Reuters, Bombay, 4th – Nationalist leader Gandhi, leading about 80 followers, will stay tonight about three miles from Dandi. Gandhi set off from Ahmedabad towards the coast on March 12th and will complete the hundred-mile journey. After arriving in Dandi, Gandhi plans to take salt from the sea, disregarding the government's salt monopoly. This is the beginning of civil disobedience. At the same time, a team of armed police has arrived near the coast.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Dandi, 5th – Gandhi told a Reuters representative this morning, "With God's blessing, the first stage has been completed happily. This action, at least from my personal point of view, is the final struggle for freedom. The government has adopted a policy of complete non-interference with my journey. I must express my gratitude."</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Bombay, 4th – Outside Victoria Station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway today, striking railway workers gathered and caused trouble. The police had no choice but to open fire, resulting in thirty people being wounded and sent to the hospital. Among the injured were one woman and three Europeans, one of whom was a policeman. Initially, two thousand strikers rushed into the station, demanding to board trains to Byculla, a place in the northeast of Bombay. The station staff refused their request, and the crowd was furious, tearing down posters and obstructing passengers. The police arrived after receiving the alarm, and the crowd threw stones at them. The police then opened fire, and the crowd dispersed. The station is currently still guarded by the police.</p>

<p>Assuming Allied Forces of Two Countries are at War with the U.S.</p>
<p>Under Pressing Circumstances</p>
<p>Coping with the Enemy in Three Stages</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, San Francisco, 4th – The U.S. Army Air Corps will begin field exercises today after yesterday's aerial review. According to its pre-arranged program, new aircraft combat tactics will be practiced, as will methods for protecting Pacific coast ports from the air. The program outline was drafted by Assistant Secretary of War Davison and communicated to Major General Harons, commander of the exercises. The content is almost a mock war. Nearly four squadrons, including pursuit, bombing, combat, and reconnaissance, with 350 aircraft, will participate. The exercises will last three weeks, until the 24th. The design assumes that allied forces of several countries are at war with the United States and will attack the coast six months later. It is assumed that the Panama Canal has been destroyed by enemy aircraft assault teams and cannot be repaired for several months. The Pacific Fleet has been blockaded by the enemy in San Francisco harbor, and the southern California region has been occupied by enemy forces. The Atlantic Fleet is fighting enemy forces occupying Pennsylvania and is unable to provide assistance. At this time, only these squadrons of aircraft, assisted by army infantry and artillery, can resist the enemy's advance while awaiting reinforcements.</p>
<p>The only major task is to protect Pacific coast cities from attack. Therefore, on the fourth day, exercises will be conducted on how to protect San Francisco from enemy naval attacks, which is the most important part of the entire field exercise. By April 17th, the exercises will enter the third stage, assuming that the U.S. military has begun attacking enemy bases in Stockton and Petaluma. The aircraft will then practice how to attack these locations and defend against enemy aircraft attacks and other activities. In the final stage, there will be a complete team performance of all aircraft.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 4th – At its first meeting today on the new tariff bill, the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee first discussed whether all amended tax rates should be made public first.

<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 4th – At its meeting this afternoon, the Joint Committee resolved to set the tax rate for peppermint at 50 cents per pound, thereby compromising on the differences between the House and Senate versions. The Senate set it at 30 cents, while the House set it at 75 cents. The crude camphor tax was also revised to one cent per pound, while mixed camphor was set at five cents. Soybean oil was also compromised at three and a half cents per pound, but the actual price should not be less than 45 percent.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th – Conservative Party leader Baldwin announced today that safeguarding industry and unifying the imperial economy will be the Conservative Party's platform for the next election. Baldwin also stated that the Conservative Party has always regarded protectionist policies as a perfect solution. The current Chancellor of the Exchequer, Snowden's, view of abolishing sugar taxes and preferential taxes is contrary to the Conservative Party's intentions. If overseas autonomous colonies want to use the collection of foreign food taxes as an exchange, then the Conservative Party, when it regains power, will propose a treaty to be decided by a national vote. The Conservative Party does not want to ask the people to vote on food taxes in the next election. The policy announced by him at the central executive meeting of the National Association of Conservative and Unionist Associations on March 3rd was approved by the Conservative Party. Baldwin had previously stated that when the Conservative Party regains power, it must economize on national financial resources and encourage industry. This measure must rely on the thorough implementation of protectionist policies in order to be realized, and protectionist policies are a more effective tool than ordinary protectionism.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Melbourne, 4th – Since Australian Prime Minister Scullin announced the new customs regulations to ban the import of luxury goods, the local automobile and whiskey industries have welcomed it, but shipping companies say that many ships will no longer sail to Australia, and Australia will feel the difficulty of exporting its raw materials due to a lack of shipping. The new regulations prohibit the import of many commodities, such as eggs, candy, dried fruit, leather, etc. The import quotas for cigars, cigarettes, tobacco, alcohol, and automobiles will be reduced compared to last year. Although beer and matches are allowed to be imported in reduced quantities, they must be subject to a 50% tax.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Chen Hanzhang's Troops Recapture Hongjiang <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>▲Li Guojun Flees to Zhijiang ▲Chen Hanzhang is Still Alive</p>
<p>A Changsha dispatch on the 3rd stated that Li Guojun of the Second Regiment of Chen Hanzhang's troops in western Hunan rebelled in Yuanzhou, attacking Hongjiang. After three days of fierce fighting with Chen Wo, commander of the First Regiment of Chen's troops, Chen Wo was defeated and led his troops to retreat to Anjiang on the 27th of last month. Hongjiang was then occupied by Li's regiment. On the 29th, Chen's regiment gathered its troops and launched a large-scale counter-offensive towards Qianyang Hongjiang, driving back Li's regiment on the 31st and recapturing Hongjiang. Li's regiment fled towards Yuanzhou. Chen's regiment is now pursuing them in different directions. Xiong Pinjun's regiment of Chen's troops is also moving towards Hongjiang Qianyang to assist in the suppression. As for Chen Hanzhang himself, the provincial government previously received news that he had died of his injuries. However, the provincial government suddenly received a telegram from Chen Hanzhang yesterday, reporting on the handling of the rebel troops and stating that he had returned to Hongjiang on the 31st. From this, it seems that Chen is still alive. The provincial government has now telegraphed Hongjiang to inquire. The text of Chen Hanzhang's telegram is recorded below: 1) "It is with great regret that my Second Regiment Commander Li Guojun inexplicably rebelled, stabbing me in the abdomen. Taking advantage of the fact that my First Regiment and Special Service Battalion were stationed in the county and the Third Regiment was participating in the campaign against Gui (Guangxi clique), he cut off the telegraph lines and suddenly entered with the strength of a regiment and five bandit brigades, besieging the few defending troops in Qianyang for several days and nights. In order to avoid being surrounded and defeated one by one and to concentrate our forces to annihilate the rebel troops in one fell swoop, I temporarily retreated to Anjiang at noon. Soon, the First Regiment and the Special Service Battalion were mobilized and led by Chen Wo, the deputy brigade commander (and commander of the First Regiment), to attack Qianyang on a clear day. When the rebel Li Guojun heard the news,</p>
<p>He led the rebel troops from Hongjiang to reinforce Qianyang. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, our troops fought bravely and decisively, defeating the main force of the rebel troops. The rebel Li Guojun was wounded in the chest, and the rebel brigade commander Zeng Chunting was killed. More than a hundred rifles and one machine gun were captured. The remnants fled towards Yuanzhou Jiangxi Street Tuokou and other areas. I returned to Hongjiang on the 31st, and the people's hearts have been calmed. It was discovered that the rebel Li Guojun was originally a bandit with an arrest warrant. I was afraid that he would disrupt the local area, so I incorporated him. However, his bandit nature was difficult to reform, and he was fickle. When he passed through Qianyang, he raped and pillaged, and no woman over the age of twelve was spared. He extorted 60,000 yuan from the Hongjiang Chamber of Commerce, and many wealthy families were robbed. I was negligent in prevention beforehand, and it is too late to regret it. All units have now been assembled and will immediately pursue and suppress them to eliminate the root cause. In addition to submitting a report to the Fourth Route General Headquarters to be forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief for arrest, I respectfully report. Chen Hanzhang, Brigade Commander of the Independent Eighth Brigade, bows to Dong Yin." (2) A thrift telegram sent from Shupu by the director of the Changsha Independent Eighth Brigade's office in the province, Xi Yi, reads: "1. Chen Wo's regiment thriftily attacked Qianyang's flank and rear via Taiping and Shuangqiao to relieve the siege of Qianyang City. 2. The rebel Li combined with bandits Yao Fengting and Tang the Great King, totaling about 4,000 men. On a clear day, they left a portion in Qianyang and extorted 60,000 yuan from the Hongjiang Chamber of Commerce. On the 30th, they left a portion stationed in Hongjiang, and the remaining troops attacked Qianyang in the morning. They were severely attacked by Chen's regiment, and both Li and his false brigade commander Zeng Chunting were wounded and fled in disarray towards Zhijiang and Tuokou. 3. When Li's rebel regiment was in Qianyang, they raped and pillaged, sparing no one over the age of twelve. Complaints filled the air. The people assisted our troops in defense, so the isolated force of three companies was able to hold out for six days and nights without falling. 4. In addition to sending pursuit teams to pursue them relentlessly to eliminate the root cause, I also reported to the Commander-in-Chief. I respectfully report. Chen Hanzhang, the seal of the world."</p>

Most of the department members are transferred from the Fuzhou Executive Office of the Naval Commander-in-Chief. The Executive Office was abolished on March 31st, and all documents were transferred to the General Command Headquarters. However, the Finance Special Envoy Office owed the Executive Office 400,000 yuan in military pay. Now, due to the closure, it is urged that the Special Envoy Office first raise 100,000 yuan within a month for payment. The Special Envoy Office stated that it is currently in a very difficult situation and cannot raise such a large amount of money at once. It is negotiating with Chen Jiliang to raise 60,000 yuan first, to be paid in three months. From then on, the military pay and expenses of the Marine Corps and the garrison troops will be handed over to the General Command Headquarters by the Special Envoy Office on a monthly basis for distribution to the various units. Now, all the military and naval power of the province has been concentrated in Chen's hands. Therefore, it has been rumored in the provincial capital that Chen will be a member of the new provincial government and concurrently act as chairman. It is also said that the Fujian situation has been completely resolved after several contacts between Chen, Liu Heding, and Lu Xingbang. Judging from the recent trends, this may be true.

<h3 id="e63">Judgment of the Yang Jingchun Case <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yang Not Guilty of Bribery</p>
<p>▲ Convicted of Trafficking Opium</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case of Yang Jingchun, former section chief of the Ziyang County Government, bribing Ning Kun, Secretary-General of the Department of Civil Affairs, to buy the position of county magistrate, was initially judged by the Jinan District Court, sentencing Yang to three months in prison. The prosecutor disagreed and appealed to the Shandong Higher Court. Yesterday, the court sentenced Yang to two years in prison, but for the crime of trafficking opium. The bribery charge was deemed unfounded. Wang Shihao, who introduced the bribery, was sentenced to two years in prison for attempted fraud. As a result, public opinion on the judgment of the case is quite suspicious, believing it to be a case of "hesitating to throw the rat for fear of breaking the vase." The original text of the judgment is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: The original judgment regarding Yang Chun, Wang Shihao, and Song Jingyu is revoked. Yang Jingchun is found guilty of conspiring to sell and transport opium and is sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The number of days in custody before the judgment is finalized will be counted as one day for every two days of imprisonment. Wang Shihao is found guilty of attempted fraud and is sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The number of days in custody before the judgment is finalized will be counted as one day for every two days of imprisonment. Song Jingyu and other parts of Yang Jingchun's case are acquitted.</p>
<p>Facts: Yang Jingchun was previously the section chief of the Ziyang County Government. He was approved by the county magistrate Hang to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs for recording. He then came to the Xinhua Company in the provincial capital to wait for the announcement of the appointment. Later, he saw Ning Kun, Secretary-General of the Department of Civil Affairs, and heard the word "preparation." He inquired about it from Wang Shihao, a clerk in the secretariat of the Department of Civil Affairs, who told him that it meant "gifts" and that 1,000 yuan was too little, and 3,000 yuan was needed. Yang Jingchun then asked Song Jingyu to help raise funds and sent a note for 2,700 yuan to Secretary-General Ning, requesting the publication of his appointment as county magistrate. Secretary-General Ning then reported to Zhu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, who sent Yang Jingchun and Wang Shihao to the provincial government one after another. After review by the provincial government committee, they were reported to the procuratorate of this court along with Yang Jingchun's statements about purchasing opium from Jia Laoba of Yongchang Paint Shop, and a letter was sent to the Jinan District Court Procuratorate to investigate and prosecute. After the court tried and judged the case, the prosecutor disagreed and appealed to this court. The prosecutor's appeal (1) stated that Yang Jingchun's bribery crime was only sentenced to three months in prison, which was too light, and that Yang Jingchun stated that he and the fugitive Jia Ziyu intended to sell and transport opium. When they arrived at Jing'an Lane in the commercial port, they were searched by an unknown person, which was considered a free statement and should be credible. (2) stated that Wang Shihao explained that "preparation" meant "gifts" when Yang Jingchun was bribing, and said that a gift of 1,000 yuan to the secretary-general was too little, probably 3,000 yuan, and that Wang Shihao confessed to asking the secretary-general to quickly announce Yang Jingchun's appointment as county magistrate on behalf of Yang Jingchun, and that Yang Jingchun's original letter to Ning Kun stated that he knew that "someone" was trusted by the secretary-general, which was considered to be of great help. (3) stated that Song Jingyu introduced friends to Yang Jingchun to raise money to seek a county vacancy, and that Yang Jingchun was staying at the Xinhua Company, and that the 2,700 yuan note stated that the company would pay upon receipt, which was considered to be suspicious of helping, and that the original trial was inappropriate to acquit them all.</p>
<p>Reason: According to the provisions of Article 128, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the essential elements for the establishment of a crime are seeking, promising, or delivering bribes or other improper benefits to a public official in connection with his duties. The appointment of a county magistrate must be proposed by the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and passed by the Provincial Government Committee before it can be announced, which is not an act within the duties of the Secretary-General of the Department of Civil Affairs. Yang Jingchun delivered a 2,700 yuan note to Ning, Secretary-General of the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting the publication of his appointment as county magistrate, which is an act of seeking bribes from a public official who is not within his duties, which is obviously inconsistent with the above provisions. The original trial sentenced Yang Jingchun to three months in prison under this article, which was a mistake. Yang Jingchun's request for a bribe from Ning, the Secretary-General, who has no authority to appoint county magistrates, does not constitute a crime. Song Jingyu, who helped Yang Jingchun raise funds for the bribe, has no criminal responsibility. However, Wang Shihao's explanation to Yang Jingchun that "preparation" meant "gifts" and that 1,000 yuan was probably not enough for the secretary-general and that 3,000 yuan was needed led Yang Jingchun to boldly deliver a 2,700 yuan note to Secretary-General Ning by letter. Wang Shihao's actions are consistent with the intention to illegally possess the property of himself or a third party and to use fraud to cause others to deliver the property of himself or a third party. Secretary-General Ning exposed the matter, and the attempt failed. It should be considered an attempted fraud. As for the section on Dang Jingchun and Jia Ziyu transporting opium, the review of the report of the Provincial Government Committee stated that Yang Jingchun once introduced Jia Laoba (Jia Ziyu) of Yongchang Paint Shop to purchase 300 taels of opium. When they arrived at Jing'an Lane in the commercial port, they were searched by four plainclothes officers with handguns. Yang Jingchun and Jia Laoba, in order to avoid being arrested, voluntarily scattered the opium, which was taken away by the plainclothes officers. The money for purchasing the opium was intended to be used to pay the check. Since Yang Jingchun and Jia Laoba voluntarily confessed to conspiring to sell and transport opium, the facts are not contrived, and the crime of trafficking opium should be established.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, the prosecutor's appeal should be considered partially justified. In accordance with Article 385, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the original judgment concerning the appealed Yang Jingchun, Wang Shihao, and Song Jingyu should be revoked, and a new judgment should be made. Yang Jingchun conspired to sell and transport opium, Wang Shihao committed attempted fraud, and Song Jingyu helped with bribery. In accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, Article 42, Article 64, Article 363, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Criminal Law, and Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is made as in the main text. This case was executed by Li Qinhe, Prosecutor of this Court, and presided over by Judge Zhao Zhiqi, Judge Li Faxian, Judge Pan Kangguo, and Clerk Su Hanjie.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Reorganization of the Northeast River Defense Navy <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲ Salvage of Various Ships Has Been Completed</p>
<p>▲ New Ships Are Being Negotiated for Purchase</p>
<p>▲ Yin Zuyin's Unruly Removal as Fleet Commander</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The salvage of ships at the Sanjiangkou Naval Base has been completed. The Jiangping warship was hit in the abdomen by a cannon, and the hull was broken. Although it has been salvaged, it is useless. The hull of the Lijie warship is still intact, but the internal damage is quite severe. The Jiangtai and Jiangping warships were damaged at the bow and stern. These three ships have been treated with cement to stop the leaks. After the river opens, they will be transported to Harbin for repair at the Northeast Shipyard. The Lichuan and Jiangting warships were self-sunk and not severely damaged. However, the hulls are high and the draft is deep, making it difficult to sail back to Harbin for repairs. A German firm, Kongshi Foreign Firm, has been contracted to modify them at Fujin for a labor cost of 9,000 yuan per ship, which will reduce the height and water absorption and increase the drainage rate. These ships are expected to be restored to their former appearance around July. After the Lisui is repaired, it will be put into service with the Lijiang, Jiangqing, and Jiangtong warships. After the river opens, they will sail to Fujin Yilan to defend the area. The Jiangtong and Jiangqing ships were originally transport ships and need to be converted into gunboats. Recently, naval defense fleets have transported steel cannons to be installed on the ships. With these four ships maintaining defense after the river opens, there should be no unexpected accidents. The budget for adding river defense warships to the Northeast has been approved at the recent Northeast Supreme Military Conference. Currently, the naval authorities are negotiating with a German firm to install equipment, with each ship requiring a budget of 400,000 to 600,000 yuan. The hulls are low, the engines are slow, and the rudders are modeled after new designs, hidden under the ships, and fueled by both oil and coal, with the intention of building nine ships. Construction is expected to begin in the summer. As for the sailors of the sunken ships, they have been organized into a naval supplementary battalion, commanded by Colonel Yin Zuogan, the captain of the Jiangting, with the captains of the Jiangping, Jiang'an, Jiejiang, and Jiangsu serving as company commanders. They train all day in the Harbin naval barracks. When the hulls are repaired, they will return to their respective ships. As for the Marines, the naval authorities have decided to organize three battalions, which are currently training in Qingdao and will be sent to Harbin after the river opens. Yin Zuyin, the commander of the River Defense Fleet, has repeatedly requested to be relieved of his duties. The authorities have approved his sole responsibility for managing the Navy River Transportation Department (in Harbin), and the position of captain has been reassigned to Xie Zhizhou, Major General Staff Officer of the Naval Headquarters. Xie is scheduled to come to Harbin in early April to take over. (March 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Rampant Banditry in Fanchang County, Southern Anhui <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fanchang and Wuwei Counties Have Sent Troops to Suppress</p>
<p>Wuwei Correspondence: Wuhua Mountain in Fanchang County, Southern Anhui, has always been a nest for bandits. Small groups of bandits from various places, whenever the official authorities tighten their pursuit, flee into it for cover. Although there have been several large-scale encirclements and suppressions, there are still more than 200 people gathered, with more than 130 rifles, not to mention other box cannons. Neighboring counties have been disturbed. Recently, they have been active near the urban area of Fanchang County from Pinggoupu, extorting and robbing, doing everything. Fanchang is adjacent to Wuwei, a commercial port on the Yangtze River and the premier area of Anhui Province. At this time of emergency in local defense, County Magistrate Sun Gongming, in addition to sending the Self-Defense General Regiment to patrol Shituo Town, also consulted with Yu Mingxun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and sent the Third Detachment of the Public Security Brigade to assist in blocking. Ning, the magistrate of Fanchang, also assembled the county's police</p>
<p>force and self-defense corps, selecting hundreds of strong men and recruiting twenty daredevils, and personally led them to suppress the bandits the day before yesterday. He also offered a reward of one hundred yuan each to those who could kill a bandit and seize a weapon. The bandits stubbornly resisted in a dangerous position on Qiangjia Mountain in the southern countryside. The two sides fought fiercely for six hours. Finally, the daredevils charged up the mountain at the risk of their lives, defeating the bandits and capturing Jin Laoxiao, an important member of the bandits. His head was cut off and carried around to show the public. More than 30 bandits were killed or wounded, and one box cannon and one pistol were seized. Eighteen kidnapped men and women were rescued, and five bandit houses were burned. One police officer was killed and several were injured. The remaining bandits, led by Yang Tulaosi, fled to Jingxian Wuwei. The public security team sent by Wuwei has not yet withdrawn in order to prevent the scattered bandits. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">New Naval Construction in Xiangshan Port <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Xiangshan military port in Zhejiang Province is not only related to provincial defense, but its situation and area are also very important for national defense. Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Minister of the Navy, had the idea of building a naval school in Xiangshan Port when he led the fleet on patrol. Later, due to the budget of at least one million yuan, there was no such large sum of money at that time, so it was shelved indefinitely. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Shaokuan inspected the port and believed that the port was indeed necessary to establish a naval school. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately instructed Deputy Minister Chen to draw up a plan for the construction of the naval school. According to news from the Zhejiang Army Survey Bureau, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressed his approval after reviewing the plan. The first phase of funding, estimated to be around one hundred yuan, has been promised to be allocated by the Ministry of Finance immediately after arriving in Nanjing. On the other hand, the naval authorities have appointed a commissioner to set up an engineering office in the port to carry out the work separately. The survey work will be assisted by the Zhejiang Army Survey Bureau. It is expected that this matter will be realized soon.</p>

<p>▲ The Jiangsu Provincial Government used to have an office in Nanjing and sent a team of guards. Now, the provincial government has abolished this agency due to the implementation of austerity policies. It was completely closed yesterday. Lin Bin, the leader of the guard detachment, also led the team back to the province.</p>
<p>▲ The Second General Team of the Provincial Police has now been organized and established. Captain Jiang Chaoxiong announced his assumption of office yesterday and put the official seal into use.</p>
<p>▲ Ge Jianshi, Ni Bi, Gu Ziyang, and others, former members of the Provincial Party Department, have now been granted bail pending trial by the High Court. Ni has returned to his hometown. Ge came to the province at 9 pm yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ The Jiangsu Provincial Women's Association believes that cases of forced marriages or forced remarriage of widows occur from time to time, which is an insult to women's rights and a violation of freedom. It has specially submitted a request to the Provincial Party Rectification Committee to ask the Provincial Government to order the county governments to strictly prohibit it.</p>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government, according to the report of citizen Jia Zi, believes that Yang Pengshan is an important transportation route and should not be designated as an execution ground. Yesterday, it specially instructed the Department of Civil Affairs and sent a letter to the court to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Gandhi's Declaration Before Departure <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Presented Fourteen Demands to the British Governor</p>
<p>Denied the Acquired Rights of Foreigners</p>
<p>World News Agency reports that before embarking on this propaganda tour, Gandhi, the leader of the Indian Non-Cooperation Movement, published an article explaining his purpose and presenting fourteen demands to the British. The translation from the Indian newspapers is as follows:</p>
<p>"After many years of prayer and many years of sincere consideration of this issue, I have advised my compatriots to use non-cooperation to resist the British in our struggle for independence. But at the same time, I have tried to find a plan that would provide adequate provisions to avoid the recurrence of the Chaura incident, which would cause violent actions and disturbances. (Note: The Chaura Chauri incident referred to by Gandhi occurred in 1922 when Gandhi advocated the non-violent non-cooperation movement. Chauri Chauri is a village in the United Provinces of India. On February 1st of that year, a volunteer team of Gandhi's followers inspected a market and was blocked by police officers. On February 4th, the market reopened, and the volunteer team attacked the police station, setting it on fire. All personnel in the station, except for the workers, were killed, and their bodies were burned. A total of 24 policemen and militiamen were killed. After this incident, Gandhi fasted for five days to atone. He told people that he regarded this as God's warning that the non-cooperation movement was implemented too early, and it was his shame.)</p>
<p>Foreseeing that the time when India and Britain will meet in force may eventually come, India, standing against the wall, can hardly find an effective and harmless plan. In today's situation, it may not be possible to carry out the non-cooperation movement in the name of the Indian National Congress. It may be necessary to carry out individual non-cooperation movements without the formal participation of the Indian National Congress. Both are unknown, because everything in India today is still in its infancy. However, as it stands, it is harmful for the Indian National Congress to participate in the proposed meeting between Indian leaders and the British Governor. It can be asserted.</p>
<p>If the Indian National Congress wants to participate in this meeting, there must be at least one condition. This I dare to say is that the British government must declare in advance that this meeting will not discuss the Whippet plan, but will focus on a concrete plan to make India independent, and at the same time fulfill the conditions suitable for this meeting. If so, the leaders of the National Congress will be happy to respond.</p>
<p>This kind of meeting must have its cause, whether it comes from the goodwill of Britain, the pressure of world opinion, or the pressure from our side. We hope it comes from our pressure. If we can develop sufficient strength, we can achieve this result. The timing of its maturity depends entirely on our own efforts.</p>
<p>I further support the claim to deny certain Indian national debts. It should be known that the transfer of Indian rights to foreigners completely disregards the national interests of India. This is known to everyone. How can such national debts be expected, and how dare we ask an independent India to recognize them by invoking the cliché of so-called acquired rights?</p>
<p>British newspapers and our British rulers speak out and threaten that our non-cooperation movement and those who resist by force will suffer severe retribution. This is futile and useless. Although those who non-cooperate and those who resist by force have different methods, their goals are the same. Both have calculated the price and are willing to suffer pain, which cannot be suppressed by power.</p>
<p>Here, I record my plan, which can be called my fourteen points. Its content is the same as that presented to the Lords Lieutenant (former Governor-General of India). Now it is presented to the Earl of Irwin (current Governor-General of India), hoping that he and the British Cabinet will implement it voluntarily.</p>
<p>(1) Complete prohibition of alcohol, (2) the ratio of the rupee to the pound is reduced from one shilling and six pence to one shilling and four pence, (3)</p>
<p>The land tax is reduced by at least 50% and managed by the Legislative Assembly, (4) abolition of the salt tax, (5) military expenditure is reduced by at least half to reduce the tax rate accordingly, (7) protective tariffs are levied on imported foreign cloth, (8)</p>
<p>Passage of the Coastal Public Land Regulations, (9) release of political prisoners, except those who have committed murder or attempted murder, (10) withdrawal of all political accusations, (11) abolition of the sedition part of the criminal law, the 1918 regulations, etc., (12) permission for all deported Indians to return to India, (13) removal of the criminal inspection department, or public management of it, (14) issuance of licenses for firearms for self-defense, which are publicly managed,</p>
<p>The above are just the most urgent needs. In addition, there are</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>should be reformed, which are too numerous to mention. Now, I would like to ask the Governor-General to satisfy India's simple and urgent needs. If the Governor-General can agree to these demands, the proposition of non-cooperation can be stopped, and the National Congress will be happy to participate in any meeting where it can express its views and make demands."</p>

<p>False Alarm in Zhujing Last Night: Zhujing Town, Jinshan County, thirty-six miles from Songjiang, urgently called Songjiang last night (4th), requesting assistance. The troops recently deployed from Shanghai were asked to dispatch a team to provide assistance. The Public Security Bureau was instructed overnight to recruit guides to lead a company of troops to Zhujing to suppress the bandits. The First Team Headquarters of the Songjiang Water Public Security Bureau also reported the situation to the Minhang District Office and sent a team to suppress the bandits. Unexpectedly, the request for assistance from Zhujing was because several ships were seen sailing straight towards Zhujing. After ordering them to stop, it was learned that they were incense-burning boats returning from the Lianxuitang temple fair. After verification, the people of Zhujing were relieved. It is reported that the troops stationed in Songjiang, considering that Qingpu is also a place where lake bandits appear, also dispatched a company to Zhenshe</p>
<p>Recovery of Stolen Goods from the World English Hall and Arrest of the Main Criminal: After the ancient clock in the World English Hall in front of the old lifting department disappeared, County Magistrate Jin immediately ordered Inspector Yin to strictly investigate and arrest the culprits. It is now learned that a sand Ah Chang, who stole the clock, has been arrested and confessed to giving the stolen goods to Dai Tongxing. He has been transferred to the county government for questioning.</p>
<p>Zhangyan Town Has Not Yet Reopened: Since Zhangyan Town, Jinshan, was looted by bandits, the shops and residents have either lost all their property or their family members have been kidnapped. The sound of crying is unbearable to witness. To this day, the whole town is closed, and the scene is desolate. For example, Zhang, a physical education teacher at Liuxi Elementary School, had no family property and relied entirely on his meager salary to make a living. He was also kidnapped. His family only has an elderly mother. Losing this beloved son, she is in extreme pain. When the robbery occurred, the county magistrate received a telephone report but did not send police to rescue them. He also did not personally investigate the situation afterward, so the aftermath of the town has not yet been resolved. Extortion by bandits is also impersonated. Fengjing, which belongs to the county and is very close to Zhujing,</p>
<p>has been affected by Zhangyan in recent days, and rumors are rampant. The local regiment police are on high alert day and night. Small groups of local bandits in the villages near Fengjing, in groups of three or five, or more than ten people together, in addition to robbery, also extort money, almost every day. There are also those who lurk in sheds, rush out to intercept pedestrians, or strip them of their clothes. It is said that in the Bainiu Dang area north of Fengjing, people dare not walk alone even in broad daylight. It can be seen that bandits are everywhere, and thorns are all over the road. As for the act of extorting money, recently, in Linjiatang near the Land Temple, seven or eight bandits with iron rulers came a few days ago and extorted money from the families in the village who were slightly better off. Those who could not offer it on the spot were allowed to come and collect it on time, and some even wrote notes. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the third day, bandits came to collect the promised money, which was roughly from 30 to 200 or 300 yuan. Farmers carrying rice</p>
<p>to sell or scraping together their meager savings to meet the promised payment. However, not long after the bandits collected it, other bandits came to extort it, saying that they had just taken it away. They said that they were impostors and did not recognize it at all, causing endless disturbances. The villagers could not cope, so they smashed furniture and stoves to vent their anger and left disgruntled.</p>

Fully equipped with firearms, they were extorting funds and seizing ships in nearby villages, spreading rumors of an impending raid on Zhujie Pavilion Town. Upon hearing the news, the town's water and land police forces immediately telegraphed the county government, requesting additional police units for joint suppression. Simultaneously, they dispatched teams to intercept the bandits. Upon receiving the report, the county government promptly sent a portion of the security regiment and telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to request military assistance in the suppression. Yesterday, a company of infantry arrived from Shanghai to join forces with the police.</p>
<p>Shen Xiuwu Requests Divorce - A Court Hearing Record: Shen Xiuwu, a woman from this county, retained a lawyer to petition the county government, accusing her husband, Zhi Shangjiu, of abandonment and neglect, requesting a division of property and alimony of three thousand yuan for educational expenses. Yesterday, Judge Shen conducted a court hearing. Both the plaintiff and defendant were present. First, Shen Xiuwu was questioned. She stated that she was twenty-nine years old, a native of this county, and worked as a teacher. (Question) When did you marry Zhi Shangjiu? (Answer) September 25th of the fifteenth year of the Republic. (Question) Who was the matchmaker? (Answer) Initially, the defendant's family entrusted Chen Qizhou to make the introduction. Later, the defendant and I exchanged correspondence and formalized our relationship. The defendant personally proposed marriage multiple times before I agreed. Chen Qizhou served as the matchmaker for the engagement. (Question) Why did he abandon you? Does he not provide for you? (Answer) Since I married him, I have never been supported by him. I have always supported myself through education. Last October, he began to show signs of abandoning me. He stayed at a hotel during the New Year holiday and did not come home. Even when I encountered him on the road several times and tried to talk to him, he ignored me. Moreover, his mother did not allow me to stay at home and drove me out. The judge then questioned Zhi Shangjiu, who stated that he was twenty-seven years old, a native of this county, and worked as a teacher. (Question) The plaintiff said that you showed clear signs of abandoning her last October. (Answer) There was no act of abandoning her. (Question) Why didn't you go home during the New Year holiday last year? Why did you stay at a hotel? Did the plaintiff encounter you on the road and try to talk to you, but you ignored her? (Answer) Last year during the New Year holiday, I happened to bring the basketball team to Qingpu for a competition, so I stayed at a hotel. After the competition, I returned to school. The plaintiff's statement that she encountered me on the road and I ignored her is not true. (Question) Where did you stay during the winter vacation last year? (Answer) I stayed at home. She stayed at her parents' home and did not return. (Question) Why didn't you call her back since she didn't return? (Answer) Because on October 29th last year, the plaintiff and her father came to my school, insulted me, and cursed me.</p>
<p>That's why I didn't call her back. (Question) Now the plaintiff wants to separate from you, are you willing? (Answer) I am not willing. (Question) She is asking for three thousand yuan for educational expenses after the separation. (Answer) I have no money. At this point, the judge questioned Shen Xiuwu again. (Question) Now the defendant is unwilling for you to separate. You have been husband and wife for many years. Would it be better to remain together? (Answer) There have been many instances of his abandoning me, so I can only separate from him. The judge then instructed both parties to invite Chen Qizhou, Yang Lucun, and relatives to mediate. If an agreement cannot be reached within half a month, the case will be heard and judged again.</p>

<p>Armed Clash at Luoshe Xiangfan: During the Xiangfan festival in Luoshe Town, Wan'an City, 16th District, villagers from various villages pooled funds to put on operas to honor the gods. This year, it was held as usual and was quite lively. However, around 7:00 PM yesterday, Zhou Xianglin from Fengzhuang had a quarrel with a certain Jia from Duanjiaqiao over a trivial matter, which led to a fight. Zhou was outnumbered and injured all over his body. He immediately fled back and gathered many people, each holding broadswords and iron weapons, to seek revenge. The two sides engaged in an armed clash on the open space next to the Luoshe Weicheng Silk Factory. As a result, Xu Acai and Jiang Jinrong from Duanjiaqiao were wounded in the head by broadswords wielded by people from Fengzhuang.

<p>Petition to Change Regulations for Wood Transportation and Distribution: Various types of timber sold by the Wuxi Timber Industry are imported from Liyang Nandao and Shanghai, with full taxes paid at the first tax checkpoint. Tax receipts are held, and the timber is transported to Wuxi for retail distribution to various villages. In the past, there were no inspections or additional taxes at the tax checkpoints. However, since the establishment of a special bureau for timber tax, the regulations have suddenly changed. Now, the timber industry must exchange import tax receipts for distribution permits, which are valid for three months. If the deadline is exceeded, additional taxes must be paid. In the past month, disputes have frequently arisen between the special tax bureau and various firms in the industry, with endless arguments. The industry convened a general meeting and unanimously agreed that since the county has no timber products of its own, they must be transported from other provinces. The timber is bulky and slow-moving, and imports cannot be easily evaded like other goods. It takes a long time to sell, often a year and a half to clear the stock. Since the implementation of the new regulations, it has not only been difficult to operate but also the tax checkpoints often take the opportunity to create difficulties and extort money. It is requested that the new regulations be changed as soon as possible to comply with the principle of "one tax per item." Yesterday, the industry submitted a petition to the County Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the authorities, hoping to achieve the goal of revocation. The Chamber of Commerce forwarded a letter to the General Branch of the Special Tax Bureau, requesting that the new regulations be changed as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.</p>

<p>▲Few Rice Shipments</p>
<p>▲Prices of all rice have fallen slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau still sent cadres to investigate the situation in the rice market in the north and south city rivers. In the south city, the prices of old Songjiang rice, rice from Chefang, Qingpu, and Langxia have all fallen by three or four jiao. However, since the Social Affairs Bureau set a price limit on rice from Tongli, the number of ships arriving has decreased sharply. Even if one or two ships arrive, the price is still required to be 18 yuan. Although the price of rice can be lowered, the deliberate holding up of rice from Tongli has some slight impact. Also yesterday afternoon, Fu Changbang, a dealer from the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Chengxian, came to the bureau for questioning, reportedly about the matter of six or seven ships of Changbang rice being held up for sale. After investigation, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered that the price limit should not be used as the standard. The market has declined, and prices should be reduced according to the market. In the north city, southern rice is still priced at 18 yuan, and there are still no buyers. The highest quality white japonica rice is 19 yuan and two jiao, and only a few transactions have been made. The market has eased, and the future market is still expected to decline. On the production side, seeing that the Shanghai market is sluggish, prices are also falling step by step, falling more than one yuan compared to the highest price.</p>

<p>Motions of the Health Committee Meeting</p>
<p>▲ Mass Vaccination Against Cholera and Smallpox</p>
<p>The Health Committee of the French Concession of this city held a meeting at 5:00 PM on March 21st of this year in the council chamber of the Municipal Council. Mr. Li Rong was elected as chairman. Attendees included committee members Baron and Gubier, Superintendent of the Municipal Council Wei Zhiren, Director-General Truelle, Director of the Health Bureau, Doctor of Medicine Anhe, and Chief of the Health Department, Bogaert. Based on the recommendation of the former Ministry of Health of the Chinese National Government, a Cholera Prevention Health Committee meeting was convened in this city on March 1st of this year. Representatives from the Municipal Government of this city and the two concession Public Works Departments attended and participated. The purpose of the meeting was to guide the residents of Shanghai to understand the methods of preventing the spread of cholera. At the meeting, the report of Dr. Stommens, Chairman of the International Quarantine Committee, was read first. The representatives from the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the two concession Public Works Departments discussed the various proposals to be adopted from May 1st. As a result, they were generally approved. The proposals are as follows: (1) Post advertisements, distribute leaflets, and, to the extent possible, produce films to show the audience, so that they all know the general principles of hygiene. (2) Provide free vaccination against smallpox to prevent residents from being infected with cholera, which is especially important in densely populated and easily infected areas. The Health Committee of this concession believes that the various policies agreed upon by the three municipal authorities contain the nature of gradually educating the public. In the opinion of the three municipal administrative authorities, establishing a printed advertising agency to carry out thorough publicity so that residents know the methods of preventing cholera would be even more effective. The anti-epidemic propaganda films distributed and screened by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government should be vigorously promoted. The French Municipal Council is willing to sacrifice a large sum of money each year for the cleaning and hygiene of this concession, and cannot be stingy in resisting this particularly dangerous cholera epidemic. Therefore, the Committee proposes to add an item of expenditure to the unexpected expenditure column of the Municipal Council's budget table for the establishment of an epidemic prevention medical office on May 1st. The medical office plans to employ three doctors, two nurses, and three assistants to form three shifts to take turns inoculating cholera vaccines. The above-mentioned mobile medical office will circulate within the concession area during the specified period, so that the residents of this concession can easily receive free vaccination against cholera. In winter, the medical office can also inoculate vaccines against smallpox and measles. These preventive measures will be very effective, so it is hoped that residents will understand the intention of the Municipal Council and ensure that this public welfare undertaking does not go to waste. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Subsequently, the Municipal Council meeting of the French Municipal Council approved the cholera vaccination measures proposed by the above-mentioned Health Committee meeting. The Board of Directors also resolved to open another expenditure item in the unexpected expenditure column of the budget table for the organization of the vaccination office, materials, and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Second Joint Meeting on Overseas Chinese Postal Rate Increase <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation, the National Federation of Commerce, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association, Jinan University, the Nanyang Culture Department, the Nanyang Students Association, and other organizations, in order to fight for the overseas Chinese postal rate increase case, organized a joint meeting and elected Chen Zhiying, Xu Jigong, Chen Chunan, Zheng Qizhong, Lin Jingxian, Zhu Xiajiu, Shan Wuchu, and other seven people as general representatives to prepare for all matters related to the case. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the general representatives held a second meeting. Situ Shangshen, Standing Committee member of the Overseas Chinese Federation, also attended and participated. A letter was sent in advance inviting Lin Bao, Director-General of the Postal Administration, to attend and participate. The Postal Administration was unable to attend and dispatched Yu Xianglin, Director of the General Affairs Department, and Xu Yingzhi, a member of the committee, to explain the situation of the case and report that the Ministry of Communications had sent a winter telegram stating that the postage for domestic overseas Chinese mail sent to Nanyang had been reduced to five cents per twenty grams, and that the British Postal Bureau in Nanyang had been contacted to discuss the matter. They also reported on the progress of establishing special postal agency offices. The general representatives stated that the five cents for domestic mail sent to Nanyang and the six cents for foreign mail sent back to China were requested by the Overseas Chinese Congress in Singapore and there would be no objection. However, they requested that the official letter from the Postal Administration be sent to the meeting so that it could be forwarded to organizations in Singapore and Shantou and Xiamen. Director Yu agreed to do so, and the meeting was adjourned. The Overseas Chinese Federation immediately telegraphed Singapore to report the progress of the postage reduction.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Foreign Shipping Companies Refuse Pilot Wage Demands <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Ships Have Resumed Service</p>
<p>Taegu, Yili, Nisshin, and Jiangjiang and other foreign steamship companies have collectively suspended navigation due to the upstream Yangtze River pilots demanding a wage increase. This disrupted the traffic on the Sichuan River. They also intend to cause economic pressure and panic among the pilots, leading them to voluntarily abandon their wage increase requests. At the same time, they also issued a notice to our Chinese merchants to join in solidarity, so that they could monopolize the upstream navigation rights. Now that the Chinese merchants have seen through their intentions and refused to be exploited, they have resumed their businesses. The details of this matter are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Pilot Wage Increase Demands</p>
<p>Among our country's various pilots, only the Sichuan River uses all Chinese pilots. Those employed by foreign merchant ships such as Taegu, Yili, Nisshin, and Jiangjiang, receive unequal treatment in terms of wages compared to Chinese ships. Moreover, their promotions are suppressed. The pilots have suffered deeply from this mistreatment, and at the end of last month, they proposed wage increase demands. Second-class pilots requested a 50% increase, and third-class pilots requested a 40% increase, with gradual annual increases. The wage for first-class pilots should be increased to $500, second-class pilots to $400, and third-class pilots to $200. Furthermore, first-class, second-class, and third-class pilots should each receive a monthly food allowance of $50, $40, and $30. Taegu and Nisshin and others strongly opposed accepting these demands and suspended all upstream ships, indicating that there was no room for compromise. As a result, traffic on the Sichuan River was disrupted.</p>
<p>▲ All Chinese Ships Resume Service</p>
<p>After the pilots put forward their demands, they clarified to the Chinese shipping companies that their actions were purely aimed at external demands and seeking a guarantee for their livelihood. When the foreign ships collectively suspended navigation, they ordered the 11 Chinese shipping companies operating upstream to suspend their services as well. The Chinese merchants refused to sign the agreement, and the British and Japanese merchants immediately accused them of disrupting the industry and negotiated with the Shanghai headquarters of each company. The companies politely declined and, starting on the 1st of this month, companies such as Sanbei and Yujiang, in order to maintain the commercial traffic between Sichuan, Hankou, and Shanghai, agreed to add a food allowance of $30 per person to the pilots and continue to work as usual. Starting from the 3rd, six Chinese ships, including Wuxing, Yujiang, Jiujiang, Hejiang, Wan'an, and Dingyuan, have resumed their service, and traffic between Sichuan and Shanghai has been restored. Goods from Shanghai to Sichuan can now be loaded and shipped.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangjiang Ships Also Resume Service</p>
<p>When the Chinese ships began to operate, foreign officials at the Yichang Customs Office spoke on behalf of the British and Japanese shipping companies and prohibited the Chinese ships from carrying goods. This was stopped after protests from the Chinese merchants. The American merchant Jiangjiang Company, which has six ships operating upstream, also acknowledged the pilots' demands independently and increased the salaries of each person by $30 according to their rank and provided a food allowance of $30. Therefore, they also resumed their service as usual from the previous day. However, Taegu, Yili, and Nisshin and other three companies still firmly refuse to increase wages and would rather suffer the sacrifice of suspending operations than accept the demands. It is known that these three companies have a total of 18 ships suspended.</p>
<p>▲ Soldiers Dispatched to Ships for Escort</p>
<p>In recent times, bandits have been rising upstream of Yichang, intercepting and looting merchant ships. This has been a frequent occurrence. In order to protect the safety of the Chinese ships that have resumed their service, in addition to installing bulletproof steel plates, they have publicly requested Guo Rudong's 20th Army to dispatch 12 armed soldiers per ship to provide escort and prevent attacks by bandits.</p>
<p>▲ Business Declines and Prices Reduced</p>
<p>Recently, although foreign ships have suspended operations and the number of ships has decreased, many merchants in Sichuan dare not ship goods due to the chaotic situation, resulting in a shortage of both upstream and downstream goods. Among the goods shipped to Sichuan, cotton yarn is the most common. Recently, various shipping companies have planned to further reduce the freight rate for yarn from $8 per piece to $6 per piece. This is currently being discussed and will be implemented soon.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Suggestions for Rectifying City Telephone Services</p>
<p>▲ Ten Points Listed</p>
<p>▲ Consultation with the Ministry for Adoption</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities considers telephones as one of the most important municipal facilities, closely related to the development of municipal industries, the maintenance of municipal public safety, the advancement of municipal transportation, and the progress of all other municipal affairs. It has been found that there are many aspects of the city's telephone system that need rectification. Although there have been plans, they could not be implemented before the jurisdictional issues of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau were resolved. However, for the benefit of the citizens, the Bureau cannot ignore the situation. Therefore, it has formulated opinions on several major areas that are considered urgently in need of rectification and submitted them to the Municipal Government for consultation with the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry is requested to instruct the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to implement these measures effectively to benefit the municipality. The rectification opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Amend the business regulations. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau stipulates that the business scope of the Nanshi area extends north to the French Concession, east and south to the Huangpu River, and west to the Rihui Port. The area west of Rihui Port is considered to be the "rural line" area. The installation of telephones within five li west of Rihui Port requires a monthly rental of eight or ten yuan (compared to five or six yuan in non-rural areas), plus a line connection fee of two yuan per pole span. In areas where lines have not yet reached, an additional pole fee of five yuan per pole is required. Similar regulations exist in other areas, such as Zhabei and Jiangwan. This approach unduly restricts the use of telephones by residents in slightly remote areas, hindering development to a significant extent. It is urgently necessary to reform this and establish new regulations to ensure that all citizens within the same urban area enjoy equal treatment, so that telephone services can gradually become more widespread, and the Telephone Bureau's business can develop and its revenue can increase.</p>
<p>(2) Change or abolish the charging method for Sino-foreign calls. Currently, Chinese telephone subscribers who wish to speak with telephones in the concessions must first pay a fee for registration before they can make calls at any time. The same applies to concession subscribers calling Chinese areas. In reality, very few telephone subscribers register, which severely limits communication between Chinese and concession telephones, causing great inconvenience to citizens. Furthermore, a charge of five cents per call is too high. If it is possible to eliminate the call charge or reduce it to one or two cents per call, it would be beneficial to the development of the telephone business.</p>
<p>(3) Establish public telephones. All major cities in Europe and America have public telephones. Even within the concessions of this city, such facilities exist. Their convenience to the public is the same as rental cars and public water taps. This allows citizens who cannot afford to install private telephones to enjoy the convenience of telephones at a minimal cost. At the same time, the Telephone Bureau can increase its income. It is urgently necessary to install them widely, such as in prosperous locations such as Zhabei Baoshan Road, Datong Road, Hengfeng Road, Mongolia Road, Xinjiang Road, and Hubei Xiaodongmen, Xinbeimen, Laoximen.</p>
<p>(4) Recover the Songyang Telephone Company. Wusong is an important area of this city, and its future development is immeasurable. Its telephone business requires careful planning and improvement. The Songyang Telephone Company in that area is currently unable to improve due to lack of responsible personnel and excessive losses. It should be recovered at a fair price to facilitate rectification and unified authority.</p>
<p>(5) Establish a Pudong branch. The Pudong area is gradually prospering, and the need for telephones is very high. The few original Sino-foreign telephones that were installed have already expired and should be dismantled. Therefore, the establishment of a branch is truly urgent. Although it is heard that the Ministry of Communications also has this plan, it is not known when it will be realized.</p>
<p>(6) Establish more branches. Each telephone line is connected to only one machine. Therefore, to save materials and reduce malfunctions, it is advisable to establish more branches. Given the size of this city, there are only the Hubei Main Bureau, the Zhabei First and Second, and four branches in Jiangwan and Wusong. This is not economical in terms of materials. Furthermore, this city is developing very rapidly, and the original overhead wiring method is becoming difficult to cope with. In the future, it will be necessary to switch to underground lines. However, adopting underground lines will require even more branch stations. Although it is said that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau also plans to add a branch in the new western district, it is not known when it will be realized. Moreover, it is not only the new western district that needs it, but also suitable locations in Zhabei and Pudong should have more branches.</p>
<p>(7) Add trunk lines. The trunk lines between Nanshi and Zhabei and between them and the concessions have not been added for a long time. Currently, the number of calls is gradually increasing and is insufficient to meet demand. (For example, the number of Sino-foreign calls in 1927 was 623,000, and in 1929 it was 918,400.) As a result, when both parties call, it is often not possible to connect immediately due to the lack of available lines, which is extremely inconvenient. It is urgently necessary to add trunk lines to meet the needs.</p>
<p>(8) Rectify the lines. It is undeniable that there are many malfunctions in the Chinese telephone system in the city. The reason for this is often due to the poor quality of the line materials or poor construction. Even during major storms, other utility poles are not affected, but telephone poles and lines are the first to be damaged. Therefore, from a technical point of view, to rectify the Chinese telephone system in the city, it is advisable to first inspect the telephone lines and repair or renovate them separately, so that users do not frequently experience unreliable calls.</p>
<p>(9) Recover Sino-foreign telephones. The installation of Sino-foreign telephones in Chinese areas not only hinders the unification of the telephone business but also harms national sovereignty. Now that the contracts have expired, they should be recovered as soon as possible. Although the Ministry of Communications has said that it will lay lines as soon as the line materials are purchased and negotiate the recovery, the contracts have been expired for a long time, and no progress has been reported.</p>
<p>(10) Ban and recover foreign telephone companies on both sides of the road beyond the border. The installation of telephones by foreign merchants on both sides of the roads built beyond the border is as detrimental to national sovereignty as the supply of water and electricity by foreign merchants on both sides of the roads built beyond the border. Although the city's water and electricity business is commercially operated, after the Bureau urged them, the supply of water and electricity to foreign merchants on both sides of the roads built beyond the border has been gradually recovered for existing installations, and new installations are prohibited. However, the city's Chinese telephones have always been operated by the government, and no measures have been heard to ban and recover foreign telephone companies on both sides of the roads built beyond the border. It is urgently necessary to imitate the water and electricity measures to ban and recover them to protect sovereignty and maintain interests.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Request to Reduce Export Tax on Zhongshan Ge <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>▲ Submission from the Shanghai Silk Industry Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shengjing Silk Industry Association yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Finance, stating that Sheng Chou Zhongshan Ge has suffered a sharp decline in sales due to the harsh taxation by the Shanghai Customs. They request a swift review and reduction of the customs export tax to seek relief and maintain the silk industry. Shengze in Suzhou has long been a major producer of Zhongshan Ge, which is entirely woven from rayon and cotton. This represents a painstaking effort to imitate foreign goods and recover rights. It is sufficient to resist the invasion of foreign goods from Japan and other countries externally, and to maintain the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of industrial and commercial workers internally. In recent years, it has suddenly been subject to valuation and taxation by the Shanghai Customs, and the valuation is arbitrary, even exceeding the cost. Currently, the tax on one load of Zhongshan Ge has reached as high as 18 or 19 taels of silver. The increased costs make promotion difficult, production and sales are declining, and the livelihoods of workers are threatened. Thousands of merchants are closing businesses and workers are stopping machines. It is truly unbearable to describe. The customs export tax for textiles made of real silk and rayon or real silk and cotton is uniformly 5 taels and 5 mace per load. Now, the tax on textiles made of rayon and cotton is so harshly levied, how can the industry survive? Furthermore, the import tax on Japanese foreign goods is only 12.5% of the value, allowing them to be sold in various domestic trading ports. Due to the different tax rates and the disparity in costs between imported goods and domestic textiles, it is no wonder that foreign goods are increasingly flooding the market, while domestic goods are declining day by day. It is impossible to compete and resist.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the silk tax rate levied on Zhongshan Ge before it is exported, which is also quite substantial. For example, when rayon is imported from Shanghai, it is subject to an import tax of 12.5% of the value. When it is transported from Shanghai to Shengze, it is subject to a Likin tax of 5% of the value in Shengze. When it is woven and transported to Shanghai, it is subject to a production and sales tax of 5% of the value in Shengze. If we add the Shanghai Customs export tax of approximately 19% of the value, the tax on Zhongshan Ge in this province has reached a staggering 31.5% of the value. When transported to other provinces and countries, it is subject to taxation everywhere, an unparalleled burden. It is truly shocking to hear. In comparison, foreign silk is taxed once and can be sold throughout the country, regardless of the vast distances. If the tax rate on Zhongshan Ge is not reduced, there will be no way to resist foreign goods, and the silk industry will have no way to escape danger. This is directly related to the livelihoods of industrial and commercial workers, which is extremely important and significant. It is also indirectly related to the national treasury's tax revenue, which is also substantial. Therefore, we respectfully submit a request for a review of the reasons for reducing the customs export tax on Zhongshan Ge. We respectfully request that your ministry, in accordance with the utmost intention of promoting national goods, and mindful of the fact that our industry is in imminent danger, approve the customs export tax on rayon and cotton woven Zhongshan Ge to be taxed in the same way as rayon and real silk or real silk and cotton woven products, in order to show balance and maintain the silk industry, and await instructions for compliance, which will truly be for the public convenience.</p>

<p>▲ Huang Manyi Visited Graves with Family</p>
<p>▲ Driving Over the Sports Association Road Bridge</p>
<p>▲ Collision Between a Car and a Bus While Avoiding a Small Vehicle</p>
<p>▲ Eight People in the Car Were Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Qingming Festival, and people were traveling to the countryside to sweep graves in an endless stream. Those who lived far away hired cars for their convenience. It was not uncommon to see cars speeding along Jiangwan Road. A Cantonese man named Huang Manyi (who worked for China Travel Service) took his family, relatives, and friends, a total of seven people, to the Shanghai Public Cemetery in Jiangwan early yesterday morning to bury and sweep graves. They also used a car as transportation. When they drove to the bridge on Xitiyu Association Road, another car came head-on. In the urgency, they could not avoid it, and they collided. All eight people in Huang Manyi's car, including the driver, were injured. Three of Huang's female relatives were seriously injured. The car was also badly damaged. It was truly an unexpected disaster. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Two Cars Collided. Huang Manyi, a Cantonese, lives at No. 2 Wenyuanfang, Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road. At around 5:30 yesterday morning, he, together with his relatives Lu Huang, Zheng Zhou, Huang, Huang Chen, Chen Yuexuan, Huang Yuan, and others, hired a car from Jiangwan Gongji Automobile Company at No. 15 Depeliri, East Yokohama Road, to go to Jiangwan to sweep graves. The car number was Shi 963, driven by Gu A'xiao, a native of Liuhe. Huang and the other seven people were crowded into the car, carrying offerings for their ancestors. When the car reached the Xitiyu Association Road bridge on Jiangwan Road and was going downhill, a car with the number Shi 953 (Concession 17580), driven by Yu Bingyan, a native of Yangzhou and a driver for the Tian Tian Automobile Company on Baek Road, suddenly came rushing towards them. At that time, there was a small car slowly moving forward in front of the car. Car No. 953, in order to move forward, went around the small car and drove forward in a semi-circular line. The car No. 963 on the bridge was already going downhill and wanted to avoid it, but the two cars collided. The people in the car were suddenly shocked, leaning forward and backward, and were instantly uneasy. At the same time, the car windows shattered, and their heads and faces were seriously injured.</p>
<p>▲ Eight People Injured. There were no passengers in car No. 953, and no one was injured. All seven passengers in car No. 963, including the driver, were injured. The names are as follows: Lu Huang, 35 years old, injured in the head; Li, 26 years old, injured in the face; Zheng Zhou, 52 years old, injured in the head, face, and abdomen; Huang Chen, 47 years old, injured in the head; Huang Manyi, 27 years old, injured in the mouth, waist, and legs; Chen Yuexuan, 62 years old, injured in the top of the head; Huang Yuan, 23 years old, injured in the chest. All were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Among them, Lu Huang, Li, and Zheng Zhou were more seriously injured.</p>

<p>▲ A Tragic Scene on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>▲ A Westerner Driving Carelessly</p>
<p>▲ Finger Severed and Tendons Pulled Out on the Gear Wheel</p>
<p>▲ Sent to the Hospital in Life-Threatening Condition</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, there were crowds of vehicles and horses and endless streams of pedestrians at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road. At that time, a Westerner came speeding along on a motorcycle, his speed so fast that he seemed to disappear in an instant. The Westerner saw the green light shining brightly and was about to speed through when suddenly a red light appeared on the utility pole. The Westerner did not dare to violate the rules and immediately braked. However, the motorcycle was small, and the sudden braking caused the vehicle to swerve, and the Westerner fell to the ground. At the same time, his right thumb was caught in the chain of the wheel. The leather glove he was wearing was crushed. The Westerner tried to use his remaining strength to right his vehicle, but unexpectedly, the tendon in his thumb rotated with the wheel, got caught in the engine, and was pulled out for more than two feet. The Westerner could no longer endure it and immediately fainted, his face pale and blood flowing like a fountain. For a moment, pedestrians scrambled to watch the excitement. Nanjing Road was crowded with people. The police, fearing that there would be more trouble, dispersed the crowd and sent the Westerner to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment in a police car. According to the doctor, his injuries were dangerous and his life was in danger. Because the Westerner was too seriously injured, he could not speak, so his name was not known in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Four-Year-Old Incident: Abducting and Selling Women into Prostitution in Pukou <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>▲ Seducing and Eloping a Few Months Before Marriage</p>
<p>▲ Falling into Unhappiness after Being Sold into Prostitution in Pukou</p>
<p>▲ Only Returned to Shanghai in May Last Year</p>
<p>▲ Foes Meet and Handed Over to Police</p>
<p>The night before last, after 8:00 PM, a Yangzhou woman handed over Jiangbei woman Cai Longyu to the police on Yalu Road, taking her to the Harbin Police Station and accusing her of abducting and selling her into prostitution. The next morning, the police summoned the woman who filed the complaint and escorted Cai to the Special District Local Court. Judge Luo Renji opened the court for inquiry. According to the woman's statement, her name is Du A'bao, 23 years old, and she currently lives in her grandmother's house on Wuzhou Road. Her parents passed away many years ago. She used to work at the Yuncheng Silk Factory in Hujiaqiao, where she met the defendant. When she was 19 years old, she was betrothed to Liu, a fellow villager, as his wife through a matchmaker. They chose December 24th of the following year for the wedding. However, a few days before the wedding, the defendant told her that Liu was the son of a poor man and his family had no standing. If she married him, she would live a life of poverty. She was seduced by the defendant. On the evening of December 21st of that year, she followed her and fled to the North Railway Station. The defendant told her to take a car to Zhenjiang. At first, she refused, but the defendant took out a pistol from his side and threatened her sternly. There was also a man who spoke privately with the defendant. Fearing his ferocity, she had to board the car with the defendant, but the man did not go with them. After arriving in Nanjing, she was taken to the city and lodged in a Lv-owned inn, who referred to her as his sister. After about three months, the defendant sent a letter summoning the man, who also arrived at the Lv-owned inn. One day, under the pretense of going on a car trip together, the car arrived at Xiaguan and they changed boats to cross the river. After arriving in Pukou, she was sold to a Chen-owned brothel there. The defendant received 400 yuan in silver and signed a sales contract. From then on, she fell into prostitution, and her cries for help were ineffective. It was not until May of last year that she managed to seize an opportunity to ask someone to send a letter to the owner of the Lv-owned inn, asking them to forward it to her grandmother to find a way to pull her out of the mire. Her grandmother received the letter and went to Pukou, but the prostitute had been moved by the madam to Yangzhou and hidden. After entrusting Director Zhou there to send a letter to Yangzhou, her niece was sent back to Pukou and handed over to her. The night before last, she passed by Yalu Road and unexpectedly met the defendant, so she handed her over to the police to be arrested. She requested punishment, etc. Then, Du A'bao's grandmother, Chen Du, arrived and testified that her niece had suddenly disappeared a few days before her wedding, and there was no news of her. Later, she received a letter from Lv, stating that she had been abducted and sold to a Pukou brothel. She went to Nanjing and begged Mr. Lv to go to Pukou to inquire at the Chen brothel. However, she was hidden by the madam in Yangzhou again. After entrusting Director Zhou there to send a letter to Yangzhou, her niece was sent back to Pukou and handed over to her, etc. When questioned, the defendant Cai Longyu stated that she and A'bao met while working in the silk factory. At the end of November the year before last, she heard that A'bao had eloped with her lover and was not abducted by her. The current statement is all false, etc. She also hired attorney Fu Kang to defend her. Judge Luo stated that the statements of the two parties were completely contradictory. The truth should be investigated. The defendant was ordered to be remanded in custody and the hearing was rescheduled to investigate the matter further.</p>

<p>▲ Adulteress Still Trying to Deny Her Wrongdoings</p>
<p>▲ Husband Was Furious and Tried to Kill Her with a Knife</p>
<p>Chang Jinlong from Hebei lives in a thatched shed in Yu's Temple, Pudong. His wife, Chang Ji, is in her prime. She is from Jiangyin. She went out to do business the day before yesterday morning. Because it was raining, she returned home to get her leather shoes and saw a man in bed with his wife, their necks entwined. When he pulled back the covers, both of them were naked. He recognized the man as Ding Kaifa, a tinsmith from Wujin who lived next door. He was so consumed by jealousy that he grabbed a knife and slashed wildly, injuring Ding's wrist. Ding ran away naked, without even having time to put on his pants. At that time, the neighbors were all shocked and gathered. Chang then held a knife to kill his wife, but was stopped by the neighbors. Chang then reported the incident to the First Precinct of the Third District and accused her, presenting Ding's clothes, shoes, and socks as evidence. The police were dispatched to arrest Ding and the woman. The woman stated that when her husband went out, she had not gotten out of bed and was still in a good dream. She did not know how Ding Kaifa got into bed or how she was raped. She was only awakened when her husband came home and tried to kill her. The precinct chief said that unless someone was dead, it was impossible for someone to get into bed and commit adultery without her knowing. He ordered her to be detained. Ding Kaifa was asked and claimed that he had been having an affair with the woman for only a month and that this was only the second time they had engaged in adultery. The precinct chief reviewed the statements and determined that the case was clear. He ordered them to be sent to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for examination and ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Abducted for Half a Year</p>
<p>On September 21 of last year, the Japan Mail Line's Osaka Company was robbed at sea off Shantou, losing tens of thousands of yuan. Before leaving, the pirates abducted four passengers on board for ransom. One of the four passengers was Xu Houyu, an employee of a British trading company in Shanghai, who was traveling to Xiamen on business and was abducted by the bandits. After the incident, the British Consul negotiated with the Guangdong provincial authorities for rescue. Xu's family also sent people to inquire in all directions. It was not until November that they received a ransom letter from the bandits. They also sent two representatives to Hong Kong to negotiate with the hostage's family, agreeing on 12,000 yuan. Later, the Guangdong-sent naval and police forces discovered the bandit's den on March 15th and attacked. After a fierce battle with the bandits for three days, the bandits were defeated and fled in all directions. Xu Houyu, who was held in the bandit's nest, and Taiwanese hostage Huang took advantage of the fact that the bandits had gone out to fight and there was no one guarding them, and risked their lives to escape amidst the hail of bullets. At that time, they were not familiar with the roads and were worried about being captured by the bandits again, so they hid during the day and traveled at night. They were without food for three days. Xu Huang ate potatoes and grass roots to fill their stomachs. After escaping from the bandit's den, they traveled on mountain roads for eight days and eight nights before finally finding a village. The two had fainted for several hours on the way. Fortunately, they were rescued by villagers who gave them food and water. They arrived in Hong Kong on March 27th. Huang stayed in Hong Kong to go to Taiwan, while Xu took a boat to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In total, he had been abducted for half a year and imprisoned in the bandit's den for about three months. In the first two months, he was moved by the bandits every night, so his hands and feet were covered in calluses and he suffered terribly. It is now heard that after returning home, he will go to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>▲ Initial Symptoms Were Vomiting Blood</p>
<p>▲ Soon Collapsed and Died</p>
<p>Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th Detachment of the 4th District of the Jiangsu Water Police, took the Pingyang Battleship to patrol the waters of Chongming and Qidong counties. The ship was near Xiaheisha at around 3 PM the day before yesterday when suddenly a water policeman on the ship fell ill, vomiting blood. He immediately collapsed on the deck and soon died. Shortly afterwards, several policemen contracted the same illness, vomiting blood one after another and collapsing on the ship. One of them was unconscious, while the others were still conscious. Captain Gong immediately sent a doctor to treat them, who observed that the symptoms were sudden and severe, and determined that it was an acute infectious disease, which was extremely dangerous. However, he did not know what kind of epidemic it was. The ship then sailed to Chongming yesterday morning and took the sick to Chongming Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the entire ship was disinfected to prevent the spread of the epidemic.</p>

<p>▲Changed to Connect to Chinese Territory Tap Water</p>
<p>Yuxin Li, located on Kunming Road, Dixiwei Road, Zhabei, was previously supplied with water by the Shanghai Waterworks Company. Due to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's ban on Chinese residents connecting to tap water from the concession, the owners of the two li voluntarily declared to the Shanghai Waterworks Company that they would switch to water from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. However, at that time, there were no Zhabei water pipes in the area, so it could not be implemented. Recently, the company completed the laying of pipes in a section of Oujia Road. The owners of the two li then fulfilled their previous promise and turned to the company for drinking water, it is said.</p>

<p>Banning the Burning of Paper Ingots During Qingming Festival</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) was the traditional Qingming Festival. Some women carried paper ingots, grass, etc., to guild halls to burn and pay respects. Yuan, the director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau, noted that there were numerous guild halls and public offices in the areas south of the Shanghai city and in Zhabei. The burning of paper ingots by the people not only wasted useful money, but also posed a fire hazard due to the densely packed thatched houses, which are dry and easily ignited. Once a fire breaks out, it could repeat last year's incident in Pudong, greatly hindering local security. At a time when superstitions are being eliminated, it is necessary to strictly prohibit such activities. Yesterday, he issued a special order to the 2nd, 4th, and 5th districts and all sub-bureaus to dispatch additional police officers to the various guild halls and public offices within their jurisdictions, such as those in the south of Shanghai, Siming, Huining, Hunan, Hubei, Dongting, Dongshan, Jinting, Jiangxi, Chao Hui, etc., and in Zhabei, Xijin, Huaiyang, Jianghuai, Wujiang, Wujin, Haichang, Guangzhao, Yanxu, Huzhou, etc., as well as places where coffins are stored. Police officers were stationed at each location throughout the day to maintain order. Those who encountered stubborn and ignorant people should be persuaded with kind words to eliminate superstition, it was said.</p>

<p>▲The Ship and Three Helmsmen Were Taken</p>
<p>▲Crew Members Shot and Driven Away</p>
<p>The Shandong Nuguo sand junk named "Guo Changhe," which was carrying cotton cloth and yarn from Yuren Gong and other firms, was sailing on the Qingkou Sea on the 27th of last month when it was suddenly attacked by a large group of pirates. The pirates arrived in two stolen ships, carrying weapons, and ordered the "Guo Changhe" to stop. Upon seeing this, the "Guo Changhe" tried to escape, but the pirates opened fire, wounding three crew members. The crew members, panicked by the situation, allowed the pirates to do as they pleased. The pirates swarmed onto the ship and searched everywhere. Finding no large amount of silver, the pirates became angry and, after beating the shipowner, forced him to sail to the foot of a mountain by the sea. They then drove the more than twenty crew members on board ashore and seized the ship, leaving three helmsmen on board to navigate.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The two pirate ships followed closely behind and sailed towards the east coast. The crew members who had been driven ashore walked for a day and night before reaching Nuguo, where they reported the incident to the goods firms. The shipowner and the three wounded crew members were sent to a hospital. One crew member died from his injuries. The ship's boss, accompanied by half of the crew members, took a steamer to Shanghai to report the incident to Yuren Gong and other firms. The firms have now telegraphed the local naval and land authorities to strictly suppress the pirates. It is reported that the goods on board the ship were worth more than 50,000 taels of silver, and the Nuguo firms have been telegraphed to investigate the whereabouts of the ship, it was said.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Report of the Tragic Disaster Situation in Yuxian County <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xiaofan, the representative of the Henan Provincial Government Relief Association stationed in Shanghai, recently received a report from the Yuxian County Chamber of Commerce Cao Jinming and the executive committee member of the county party headquarters, Hou Zhenting, regarding the disaster situation in the county. The report stated that Yuxian County is a famous county in Henan Province, a gathering place for drug merchants, and has always been known for its prosperity. Since the city was captured by the huge bandit Bai Lang in May of the Republic, and a large-scale plunder was carried out, the city and rural merchants have lost all their wealth. Since then, bandits have been as numerous as hairs, burning, killing, looting, and there has been no peaceful day. In the autumn of the 13th year, Cao Shiying, the Shaanxi army, led thousands of undisciplined soldiers to garrison in Yu, using their power to demand more than 500,000 yuan in supplies and military pay, and colluded with the bandits to disturb the four villages. The people of Yu were on the verge of bankruptcy. In the spring of the 14th year, the brigade mutinied for no reason, looting, burning and killing, which was extremely miserable. In the spring of the 15th year, the brigade withdrew westward, and then Li Zhenya led tens of thousands of bandits to Yu to eat, demanding more than 70,000 yuan from merchants and civilians every month to pay for their military pay, and separately demanding firewood, grass, rice, and noodles worth tens of thousands of yuan per day. The army was stationed for more than a year, demanding a total of 1.5 million yuan, and their officers and soldiers were all from the green forest, colluding with the bandits, so the banditry in the four villages increased day by day, and the private losses were even greater than the levies. In the 16th year, after the Second Army Group defeated the bandit troops, the famous bandits Li Geng and others rose up at the time, with 6,000 to 7,000 bandits, killing everyone they met and burning every house they saw. All the villages in the four villages were attacked and broken, and the farmers who had not been killed all fled. The villages and fields were turned into wasteland. The villages dozens of miles west of the county were uninhabited. The banditry was at its worst. Unfortunately, in the 17th year, there was another severe drought, and there was no grass in the fields. The victims searched for food and stone flour to fill their hunger. They often ran around all day without getting anything. They were truly unable to protect themselves in the morning and did not know where they would die in the evening. There were suicides due to starvation everywhere, and it was even more difficult to count the exact number. When the rain fell in the summer of last year, the autumn crops could be planted. When the people of Yu were celebrating that there was already a chance of survival, unexpectedly, a flood broke out, and residents along the Ying River were washed away, and good land was turned into sand and gravel, with losses estimated at more than 5 million yuan. Before the flood had subsided, the huge bandit Wei Zhi and others led more than 10,000 followers to rob the villages in the southeast of the county, from a few miles outside the city to the Huangyu Store, Southwest Wang, and other villages 60 miles southwest of the county, and the towns of Shen etc. All the villages in the town were robbed. Therefore, the whole county was a place for the bandits to gallop around. The houses in large and small villages were almost burnt down. Those with a little property were taken away, and those who were poor and had no money were often massacred. The villagers were terrified and fled into the county town to beg for food, filling the streets and lanes. They could only rely on begging and could not live. There was no place where people were starving to death on the streets. Alas, the people of Yu suffered so much that they were in such a miserable situation. They only hoped that the years would be peaceful and the fields would be bountiful, which could make up for the losses by one in ten thousand. Suddenly, more than 100,000 central troops suddenly arrived in the county, and then fought with the Northwest Army in the western half of the city for more than ten days. The supply of vehicles and fodder was exhausted. As soon as the war subsided, Liu Guitang's army, the 4th Division of the newly compiled army, stayed in the county town, and the county people were ordered to apportion all the military pay and supplies. If there was any delay, they would be forced to act freely. In the county for more than a month, a total of 424,000 yuan was levied. Last month, when the army was about to leave, the city was closed for several days, and every household was searched. All the soft rice and food of the merchants and people were emptied, and their value was about 60,000. The people who were dying were subjected to another severe robbery. The deep water and fire could not be described their suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Continued Request for Spring Relief from Representatives of Langxi County <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to the reports from Anhui Langxi County representatives Niao Huinan, Wang Jing, and others, the spring disaster was severe, and there was no way to survive without relief. Now, according to the continued report from the representatives, the 10,000 famished victims in the county were displaced, and the whole family of several people poisoned themselves and died, and the thieves and bandits were even more committed to robbing and dividing the spoils, only to get one or two pieces of meat and thousands of copper coins, and they were immediately executed by the officials, and the suicides were increasing in an endless stream, and the offenders were increasing one after another, so they would not do that if they were happy. Now the wheat is half-frozen to death due to too much rain and snow, and even the seedlings are eaten by the victims, and those who planted seeds have nothing to gain, and the autumn harvest is difficult to expect. With 200,000 victims, if they don't die, they will be thieves and bandits. Some people know that your association is relieving Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, and taking care of them is not against the law, but our county is severely affected, and the area is not large, so less relief money will be more effective. In this shortest period of time, if we can allocate 30,000 yuan in cash to relieve the planting, we can still do it. If we miss the time, there will be no effect in spring and autumn, even if it is a huge sum of 100,000 or 200,000 yuan. We sincerely ask you to show your sympathy and lend a helping hand, and we will be waiting for your order.</p>

<p>A certain shoe and hat shop at 748 North Zhejiang Road, opened by a Ningbo native named Ye Xiaolin, reported that yesterday morning, his apprentice, Wang Qiyou, 15 years old, went out to buy foreign satin. While walking under the sidewalk, a freight truck from the North Railway Station suddenly came. Wang did not avoid it and continued to walk forward, intending to cross the road, and was struck by the car. He fell to the road and was injured by the rear wheel of the vehicle. Officer No. 2301 took Wang to Tongren Hospital, but he died of his injuries yesterday afternoon. The hospital reported this to the Mixed Court, which ordered detectives to take Wang's body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning at 10:45, the Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo Wei to the scene to conduct an examination. The French detective explained the situation and stated that the driver of the car, Lu Jianian, was not present for questioning. According to Lu Jianian's statement, there were four workers in the car that day, and he was sitting in the front. The child was hit by the side of the car, and he did not see it. Later, he heard the workers say that a child had been injured. When he stopped the car, it was too late. He has been a driver for a year and a half. Ye Xiaolin stated that after Wang was hit, he immediately wrote a letter to his hometown, asking his parents to come to Shanghai. Therefore, he cannot make decisions about Wang's burial alone and must wait for his parents to arrive. After reviewing the statements, Prosecutor Guo announced that the hearing would be postponed to Monday next week.</p>

<p>▲Wei Gengsheng Violates Ethical Principles</p>
<p>Yan Xiaobao from Gaoyou had a sister who married Wei Gengsheng, a fellow villager. After a few years, the sister passed away. Later, Wei came to Shanghai to work at the power plant and lived at 117 Haichang Road in Zhabei. Last year, Wei returned to his hometown. Yan entrusted his biological daughter, Cui Bao (Wei's niece, 21 years old), to Wei to take to Shanghai to find work and supplement the family income. After Wei brought Cui Bao to Shanghai, he found her attractive and did not find her work but instead had sexual relations with her. This was discovered by Wei's mistress, Ms. Xu, leading to jealousy and forcing Wei to kick Cui Bao out and forbidding him from seeing her. Wei had no choice but to flee with Cui Bao to a workshop in Caojiadu in western Shanghai. They both worked in a yarn factory, living together like husband and wife. Wei's mistress was furious after Wei hid away. Cui Bao's father, Yan Xiaobao, came to Shanghai to look for Cui Bao because he had not heard from her since she arrived. He met Wei's mistress, Ms. Xu, who revealed that Wei and Cui Bao were having an affair and had fled. Yan was outraged that his uncle-in-law had committed incest with his niece, violating ethical principles. He searched everywhere and learned from a fellow villager that Wei and Cui Bao were working at a yarn factory in Caojiadu. He went there yesterday and waited outside the factory.

<p>▲Both Sides Engage in a Major Brawl</p>
<p>Wang Youyu, a native of Gaoyou, rented a place near the Sanjing Pier in Pudong and worked as a stevedore. Wang had a 19-year-old daughter who worked in a cigarette factory, leaving in the morning and returning in the evening, as usual. Unexpectedly, she disappeared on the sixth day of last month and has been missing for over a month. Wang's wife, Chen, suspected that Huang Kaitai, the son of their neighbor Huang Si from Changzhou, had abducted her. Yesterday, Wang's wife questioned Yang, Huang's wife, and a disagreement led to a conflict. Then, more people arrived on both sides, wielding weapons and fighting. As a result, both sides suffered minor injuries, but Wang had blood all over his face and was seriously injured. Officers from the Third Precinct of the Public Security Bureau arrived and arrested ten people, including Wang Si and his wife Yang, Wang Kaitai, Wang Youyu, Wang Chen, Zhang Huairen, Tang Lanxi, Wang Yang, Wang Si's son, and Wei Huang. After questioning by the district chief, the case was deemed criminal and referred to the District Court for prosecution in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Chen Bingjin Certainly Died by Suicide <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Chen Bingjin, a Jiangbei native, who died across from the World Cinema on Qingyun Road in Zhabei, his uncle Chen Zihong noticed rope marks on the back of the deceased's neck, different from those caused by hanging, and suspected foul play. He requested the District Court to conduct an examination, as reported yesterday. It is now known that the result of the examination by Prosecutor Lei and the coroner was that Chen died by suicide. Although there were marks on the back of his neck, they were caused when he hanged himself by wrapping the rope twice around his neck, resulting in the marks being higher in the front and lower in the back. If he had been strangled, the marks would have been the same shape in the front and back. The family accepted the findings. It is said that Chen Bingjin committed suicide because he was beaten after losing money gambling.</p>

<p>▲City Government Orders Public Safety and Social Affairs Bureaus to Investigate and Strictly Prohibit</p>
<p>The City Government considers the issuance of lotteries to be a form of gambling, disrupting finances and harming society. The Central Government has issued a clear order to prohibit them. However, some merchants and ruffians take advantage of the concessions, disregard the law, and continue to issue them to deceive the public. The Shanghai Executive Committee sent a letter to the City Government yesterday, stating that it had received a letter from Wang Lianqing, claiming that the Hubei Limin Lottery was a complete scam. Upon receiving the letter, the City Government immediately instructed the Public Safety Bureau to work with the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and strictly prohibit it.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 6:00 a.m., a man jumped into the river from the Baidu Bridge outside the Suzhou Creek mouth. He was spotted by Officer No. 24 of the Water Police, who rescued him. He claimed to be Xu Jigen, 45 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 39 Tongkang Lane, Holy Mother's Church Road. He has a 15-year-old daughter, and his wife, Zhu, works as a helper. He used to work as a laundry delivery man for Wang Zhangji Laundry on Jupiter Road. Because he only has a daughter, he leaves early and returns late. However, the owner has no way to make a living, so he committed suicide by jumping into the river. The head detective, after hearing his statement, ordered detectives to inquire at Wang Zhangji Laundry to see if Xu had been fired. The owner said that Xu's work had always been accurate, and he had not been fired. The detective reported this to the head detective, who then summoned his wife, Zhu, to the station. She said that her husband had the mindset of a child and would do pointless things if things did not go his way, like a fool. Since his wife had arrived, the head detective released Xu to her.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00, a fire broke out in the upstairs厢房 of the residence of lawyer Fei Guoxi at 47 Shengsun Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. Sparks flew and smoke filled the air. However, Fei and his family had left Shanghai a few days ago and had not returned for two days. The door was locked, and the maids were all downstairs, so they did not notice. The neighbors noticed and exclaimed that there was no one upstairs, so where was the fire coming from? Looking into the courtyard, it was already raging. They panicked and were at a loss. Fortunately, fire trucks from the Chinese and foreign concessions arrived and the firefighters rushed upstairs, broke down the door, and threw the burning clothes trunks and other items out the window and cut off the power lines, preventing further damage. The remaining fire was extinguished, and the patrolling police reported to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>▲New New Company Workers' Union Cries of Unemployed Workers To all dear compatriots, our capitalist, New New Company, took advantage of the Lunar New Year to fire 43 of our fellow workers without any reason. We are all old employees who entered the company when it opened, especially those who came from Sincere and Wing On. The original intention was to earn a few more dollars, but who knew that we would suffer from internal disputes within the company, resulting in economic losses. However, we always felt that the cost of living was high and it was not easy to make a living, so we always kept calm and held on to our jobs during these years. Not to mention that we have made contributions, we feel that we have not made any mistakes. However, the company, without asking right from wrong, used its usual trick to treat workers and fired us in large numbers. We are citizens under the clear blue sky and white sun, protected by the party, and we cannot bear to be trampled on by capitalists as in the warlord era. Therefore, we reported the capitalist's unreasonable dismissal to the party and government agencies for assistance. Unexpectedly, the capitalist used the concession as a protective charm, listened to the instigation of one or two people, and ignored the government's orders. The Social Affairs Bureau convened three mediation sessions, but he ignored them all, regardless of our livelihood panic and the shame of our poverty. Today, in the autumn of expensive rice prices and difficult living, those who pay attention to social conditions are worried about the increasing number of unemployed people. New New capitalist, with huge assets, has a special intention to take advantage of this opportunity to fire a large number of workers, hoping to create social unemployment terror and trap workers in a desperate situation. We don't know what his intention is. We have been unemployed for more than two months, and our living difficulties are unbearable. We can only beg for help from all walks of life, hoping that the public will give us a fair judgment, so that the future of the labor movement can still be saved. Signed by 43 workers fired by the New New Company Workers' Union at the end of the year, April 5.</p>

Request a public decision. Resolved: Inform all factories that in the future, the union will issue a temporary certificate for all important matters or investigations. Anyone without a certificate will be considered an imposter. (4) Comrade Mei Guozhen, representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, gave detailed criticisms, which are omitted.

<p>▲Result: 3 Minutes, 42.5 Seconds</p>
<p>First: Liaoning::::Second: Shanghai</p>
<p>Third: Hunan::::Fourth: East Special District</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2 PM, the final of the men's 1600-meter relay race took place. Only four teams participated: Shanghai, Liaoning, Hunan, and East Special District. Teams from Tianjin, Beiping, Guangdong, and Zhejiang did not compete. It was heard that the Tianjin team was too fatigued from consecutive days of competition and was preparing to participate in today's 800-meter relay race, hence their absence. The audience's attention was focused on the Shanghai and Liaoning teams, as their strengths were considered equal, and it was uncertain who would emerge victorious. The Shanghai team lineup was Zhu Ruihong in the first leg, He Debao in the second leg, Su Zuqing in the third leg, and Wang Jianwu in the anchor leg. The Liaoning team lineup was Cai Fangpu in the first leg, Gu Shirong in the second leg, Lang Dakui in the third leg, and the sprinting prodigy Liu Changchun in the anchor leg.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai Takes the Lead</p>
<p>At the sound of the starting gun, Cai Fangpu of Liaoning sprinted out, leading the way. Zhu Ruihong of Shanghai was second, East Special District third, and Hunan fourth. By the halfway point, Zhu Ruihong was making a strong effort to catch up, closing the gap with Cai to about one meter. By 300 meters, Zhu and Cai were neck and neck. Eventually, Zhu took first place, with Cai of Liaoning second, a few steps behind. East Special District remained third, and Hunan fourth.</p>
<p>▲A Three-Meter Gap</p>
<p>In the second leg, He Debao of the Shanghai team ran hard, with Gu Shirong of the Liaoning team closely following. Both maintained their positions. However, in the final half of the lap, He Debao had a slight advantage, with a three-meter gap between first and second place. East Special District was third, and Hunan fourth.</p>
<p>▲During the Third Leg</p>
<p>In the third leg, Su Zuqing of the Shanghai team became even more spirited, while Lang Dakui of the Liaoning team did not show weakness, chasing hard. Ultimately, Shanghai was faster during the baton exchange, further widening the gap. By the time they reached the end of the leg, the distance between first and second was about five meters. Everyone believed that Shanghai would undoubtedly win the championship, and Liaoning, despite its ferocity, could not touch it. Unexpectedly, the result was quite surprising.</p>
<p>▲The Prodigy Displays His Power</p>
<p>In the fourth leg, Wang Jianwu of the Shanghai team knew that a strong opponent was behind him and that extraordinary effort was needed to complete the mission. He pushed hard, but Liu Changchun, the sprinting prodigy in the anchor leg for Liaoning, advanced fiercely, swift as a galloping horse. By the time he ran 200 meters, the gap was only three meters. By 300 meters, Shanghai and Liaoning were side by side. At 320 meters, he completely overtook, and a burst of applause shook eardrums. At the finish line, Liu Changchun was about three meters ahead of Wang Jianwu, creating a new record of 3 minutes and 42.5 seconds. (Note: The national record is 3 minutes and 45.4 seconds.) Liaoning's victory was entirely due to the prodigy's power. Without the prodigy, it would have been impossible to surpass Wang Jianwu by seven or eight meters. At the time, Hunan also overtook, East Special District took third, and East Special District fourth.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Game Results</p>
<h3 id="e155">Soccer <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Second Round, Group Two</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Overwhelms Hubei</p>
<p>▲A Score of Nine to One</p>
<p>▲Hubei, Though Defeated, Deserves Honor</p>
<p>Li Huitang Did Not Play</p>
<p>(2) Guangdong Defeats Jiangxi</p>
<p>▲A Score of Twelve to Zero</p>
<p>▲Victory Comes Quite Easily</p>
<p>▲The Shanghai vs. Hubei Match</p>
<p>The Shanghai team has many talented players and has reigned supreme in Shanghai for more than a year. The excellence of their soccer skills is widely praised by people throughout the country, requiring no introduction from reporters. The Hubei team's technique is ordinary. As a newly formed team facing a battle-hardened force, their chances of not being defeated were slim. Watching yesterday's game, the Hubei team strived hard from beginning to end, never losing heart due to setbacks, and regarded the competition as an opportunity to hone their skills. This spirit is truly rare in the sports world, and the team can take pride in it. Hubei team, keep up the effort!</p>
<h3 id="e156">Shanghai Scores Too Many Goals <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>At the afternoon hour, the two teams began contact. The Shanghai team advanced steadily, while the Hubei team's formation was very scattered, leading to a complete rout. Initially, the Hubei team was able to hold on, but as the Shanghai team's prowess gradually emerged, the Hubei team increasingly lagged behind, losing all fighting spirit and finding it difficult to defend, let alone counterattack. The Shanghai team, having won by a large margin, simply went through the motions, so the situation became lax later on, with nothing exciting to report. Spectators began to leave one after another before the game was even finished.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The First Half Was Quite Competitive <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The first half was quite competitive. Shanghai's first goal was scored by right winger Tong Rongwen five minutes after the start of the game. The second goal was shot by Wang Yongjie, and the third was a cross from Fu Hexuan, with Tong Rongwen rushing in. The first half ended with a score of three to zero. After switching sides, about three minutes into the game, Chen Jiaqiu scored a goal. After the Shanghai team scored four consecutive goals, Hubei finally opened their account. This goal was scored by Hubei's right inside forward, taking advantage of Shanghai's inside forward's carelessness. The fifth goal was kicked in by Chen Jiaqiu. Tong Yuwen scored the sixth, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth goals were all scored consecutively by Chen Jiaqiu. Among these two goals, the first was thanks to Tong Rongwen's passing, while the latter two were the result of mutual assistance from the three midfielders. The result was a score of nine to one. Referee Yue Xiurong.</p>

<p>▲The Guangdong vs. Jiangxi Match</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Guangdong soccer team defeated Jiangxi by a score of twelve to zero. This was the first act of the second day of the second round of soccer matches. The Guangdong team was well-rounded, excelling in both attack and defense. The Jiangxi team, on the other hand, had a superior center back, but the forwards lacked cooperative passing, which was the root cause of the team's defeat. The lineups for the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Danger emerged again, Chen Guangyao scored with the help of the center forward in a crowded area, the right wing Gao Wei fell to dribble a ball in. Guangdong's momentum was strong, and scored four consecutive goals at the end, with a score of to in the first half</p>

<p>A Score of Thirty-Four to Thirteen</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Team's Basketball Skills Are Not Weak Either</p>
<p>The Tianjin basketball team has high hopes for a championship in this tournament. In their first match, they overwhelmed Jiangxi with a score of one hundred and fifty-three to four, creating great momentum. They seemed confident that the basketball championship would be theirs. Yesterday at 1 PM,</p>
<p>they met Jiangsu in the second round. Jiangsu's strength was also quite formidable, as they had defeated the resilient Guangdong with a score of forty to twenty-seven. Their organized formation was evident. After 12 o'clock, the stands around the court were packed, and no fewer than a thousand spectators were standing along the short railings. The lively atmosphere was an unprecedented record for this basketball tournament. ▲Tianjin Takes the Lead First</p>
<p>At the sound of the whistle, the athletes of both teams sprinted and rushed. Tianjin took the lead first. Wei Pengyun jumped up, but his attempt was unsuccessful. Jiangsu, seeing the unfavorable situation, tried its best to defend. Inner guard Ren Xingjie saw the opponent passing the ball and was about to launch a major counterattack, but Tianjin used a five-man zone defense, surrounding them like an iron fortress. All paths were blocked, and Jiangsu could not attack, so they passed the ball within their own territory, trying to lure the opponent out to fight, and then seize the opportunity to enter. However, Tianjin remained unmoved, each guarding their defensive positions, without the slightest slack.</p>
<p>▲Jiangsu's Defense Is Tight</p>
<p>Before long, Jiangsu committed a foul and was penalized, giving Tianjin two points. Jiangsu's Zhao Congyan also scored one point, making the score two to one. After a stalemate of ten minutes, Tianjin once again gained momentum. The iron gates Li Guochen and Wang Xiliang sneaked into enemy territory and repeatedly performed remarkable feats. The result of the first half was only eleven to four. The closeness of the score</p>
<p>showed the tightness of Jiangsu's defense.</p>
<p>▲Switching Sides and Fighting Again: Tianjin Changes Strategy, and the Lineup Shifts, Yao En'han Replaces Wei Pengyun, Yao Is Brave and Unsurpassed, and the Morale of the Army Is Boosted, Bao Kun Appears and Disappears Under the Basket, Making It Impossible to Predict, and Scoring the Most Points Alone. The Jiangsu Defensive Player Ren Jexing Saves a Lot of Dangerous Balls, and Zhao Congyan Also Has Many Commendable Points, But the Whole Team's Liaison Kung Fu Is Not As Refined As Tianjin's. As a Result, With a Score of Thirty-Four and Thirteen, Tianjin Wins.</p>

<p>▲The Athletics Championship Rests on This One</p>
<p>Third: Hubei, Fourth: Liaoning Have Already Been Decided</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3 PM, there were six teams in the final of the women's 200-meter relay: East Special District, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Beiping, and Liaoning. The most promising teams were, of course, East Special District and Guangdong. The lineup for East Special District was Liu Jingzhen in the first leg, Wang Yuan in the second leg, Wu Meixian in the third leg, and Sun Guiyun in the anchor leg. The lineup for Guangdong was Situ Wei in the first leg, Huang Shuwei in the second leg, Zheng Li in the third leg, and Liu Youqing in the anchor leg.</p>
<p>The strengths of the two teams can be said to be evenly matched. At the sound of the starting gun, Guangdong took the lead. By the end of the third leg, Guangdong was about two meters ahead of East Special District, and Guangdong was still in first place. After Sun Guiyun's hard chase, she almost caught up with Liu Youqing at the finish line. The referees were unable to distinguish between first and second place, so they decided to rerun the race between East Special District and Guangdong once at 1 PM today to determine first and second place. According to the women's track and field results, other than the 200-meter relay race, Guangdong was in first place with a total of 20 points, and East Special District was in second place with a total of 17 points. The relay race is worth ten points for first place, six points for second place, four points for third place, and two points for fourth place. If East Special District wins first place today, then their total score will be 27 points. If Guangdong wins second place, then their total score will be 26 points, a difference of one point. East Special District will win the women's track and field championship; otherwise, it will be won by Guangdong. Therefore, today's 200-meter relay race is of great importance. It is expected that the two teams will have an extremely fierce competition. The third place has already been determined as Hubei, and the fourth place as Liaoning; there will be no rerun. Representatives from East Special District have lodged complaints with the referees, claiming that East Special District was first and not agreeing to a rerun.</p>
<p>East Special District and Guangdong Tied for First Place in the Women's 200-Meter Relay Race. East Special District Disagreed with the Referee's Decision and Lodged Complaints for a Long Time. After Dai Jitao's Mediation, They Finally Agreed to Continue the Race Today.</p>

<p>Shanghai's Chen Yingrui Joins the Battle</p>
<p>Building So Much Individually</p>
<p>After the men's Tianjin-Jiangsu game ended, the Tianjin and Shanghai women's basketball teams took the stage one after another, stretching their muscles and trying out the baskets. Referee Shu Hong and inspector Gao Zi discussed and decided on the battlefield. Shanghai was in the south, and Tianjin was in the north. With the sound of the silver horn, the fierce battle began. Shanghai, Guangdong, and other teams have great hopes for championships in this tournament. After Shanghai arrived, because the first game was scheduled against Fujian, and Fujian was absent, Shanghai won without any effort. Today is the first time they are playing, and people in Hangzhou are vying to see them as soon as possible. The audience is more crowded than before. Shanghai's attack is quite fierce, and the passing of the forwards is truly like dragons and tigers. Chen Xinyuan's long shot missed, but Tianjin snatched the ball. Before long, Tianjin</p>

<p>Li opened the record. Shanghai, after this setback, how could they be willing to give in? Chen Xinyuan was awarded one point, and Shao Jinying also scored three points in a row. After a two-minute break, the game continued. Shanghai's forwards had excellent shooting skills, but unfortunately, luck was not on their side, and they only scored one goal. The result of the first half was six to three, with Shanghai taking the lead.</p>
<p>In the second half, Shanghai sent Chen Yingrui to join the battle. Chen is the star of women's basketball in Shanghai, and her basketball skills are extraordinary. Single-handedly, she feints and attacks, building so much individually. The defender Yu Qiying, stealing the ball and defending people, made great contributions that cannot be buried. The final score was twenty-one to six. The scores for each quarter were four to two, one to one, nine to zero, and six to two.</p>

<p>▲A Score of Two to Zero</p>
<p>▲Guangdong Team's Front Line Is Good</p>
<p>At 9 AM on the 5th, Guangdong and Jiangsu met in the second round. The Guangdong team has long been famous and is also qualified for the championship in this tournament. The Jiangsu team's players are all from South China and are skilled in this sport. Their strength is also quite good, but compared with Guangdong, they are still slightly inferior. From observing yesterday's game, the Guangdong team's front two rows of formations were very tight. The attack was very strong, but the back row defense was poor. The Jiangsu team's points were often scored by hitting the back area. At the beginning of the competition, the Guangdong team's momentum was strong and unstoppable. Chen Congchao served and scored eight points in a row, intimidating the Jiangsu team. The subsequent battle was extremely fierce, and the Jiangsu team also gained some points. In the first half, Guangdong took the lead with eleven to two. After switching sides, the Jiangsu team made a concerted effort to counterattack, once gaining a six to twelve situation. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Guangdong quickly cheered up, and the lifts and spikes were very exciting. The spiked balls were often able to hit the mark at will, entering the weak spot. Observing their spiking method, they always waited for the ball to be less than a foot above the net before jumping and hitting hard. Therefore, the ball fell quickly and powerfully, forming a diagonal straight line, making it most difficult for the opponent to defend, which was the key to the Guangdong team's victory. Therefore, they continued to win, winning the first set with twenty-one to twelve. In the continued match, the Guangdong team took advantage of the victory to pursue, intensifying their efforts. Jiangsu became even more unsustainable. Before long, they won again with twenty-one to two, resulting in a score of two to zero. Referee Wu Bangwei.

<p>The team had an organized lineup, with better coordination. The second and third rows could make good use of the three-hit attack to defeat the enemy. The Zhejiang team had a scattered layout, and the return ball often used both hands, which was light and weak, and the direction was even more difficult to be accurate. Therefore, comparing the two, the gap was too great. In the first game, the Zhejiang team had good spirit, but the strength was weak. The two</p>
<p>The position of the standing row was too far away, which often gave the opponent a chance to take advantage of the situation. After a long battle, Tianjin won by twenty-two to three. In the second game, the Zhejiang team's situation was even more scattered, with no power to fight back. Moreover, many people stood still and hit back casually. The spirit was decadent.

<p>Shanghai Jia Women's Volleyball Team, who won over Beiping B in the preliminary round, Hubei Province belonged to the bye. At 3 PM on the 5th, the two teams held the second round match. Shanghai Jia's volleyball skills are outstanding, and they were admired by the audience in the previous competition. Hubei Province is located in the interior, and women's sports are relatively late in development. They have little experience in volleyball. If they compete with the Shanghai team, they will certainly be far behind. Watching the competition on this day, because the strength of the two teams was too far apart, there was nothing exciting to say. The two games only lasted about ten minutes. The Hubei team's formation was scattered and disorganized. They had no contact at all. That is, they did not understand the method of receiving and returning the ball at all. Shanghai's attack was effortless. They only needed to send the ball over the net to win. The first game was twenty-one to three. The second game was twenty-one to four. As a result, the score was two to zero, and Shanghai won. Referee Li Feiyun. The lineup is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Brief History of Athletes <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Four Ladies from the Eastern Special District</p>
<p>Yesterday's 200m Women's Relay Race, from the Harbin side, are the four ladies Sun Guiyun, Liu Jingzhen, Wang Yuan, and Wu Meixian. Their brief history is described below:</p>
<p>Ms. Sun Guiyun is from Shandong, 16 years old. Ms. Liu Jingzhen is from Jilin, 18 years old. Ms. Wang Yuan is from Wujiang County, Jiangsu, 16 years old. Ms. Wu Meixian is from Yixing County, Jiangsu. The four ladies have been friends since childhood and have a deep relationship. They initially only studied together and occasionally did outdoor sports after class. In 1928, they went to Fengtian to visit the Eastern Provinces Joint Games. Because they felt they lacked experience, they did not dare to participate. However, after seeing the results of the women's track and field events in the venue, there were no particularly special records, so they participated as guests. The results of the competition showed that their performance in each event actually exceeded the previous women's records. They became famous in the three provinces and practiced even harder after returning. They successively joined the Special District Federation and also gained a great reputation. Ms. Sun also won first place in the track and field event and first place in the overall school score. Last year, she also joined the North China Games. With Ms. Sun's efforts, she could have won first place in the overall score, but due to non-compliance with the procedures when registering, ten points were deducted, barely ranking second. She also joined the Sino-Japanese-German Games. Ms. Sun competed with the Japanese athletes, and the Japanese athlete broke the world record with 12 seconds in the 100m. Ms. Sun also won third place with 13.7 seconds, truly opening a new era in the history of women's sports in our country. On weekdays, the ladies engage in sports together, all year round, getting up at dawn to study hard, and never wasting any time after class, which is why they have achieved such results. Ms. Sun is still young and her physical strength is not yet fully developed, but she is already able to do so. If she continues to improve and work hard in the future, she will definitely take the lead in women's track and field in our country. As for Ms. Liu, Wang, and Wu, they are all promising talents and can be said to complement Ms. Sun. May you all strive hard!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Odds and Ends <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>▲ Strive for the Future</p>
<p>The Jiangxi athletes have suffered consecutive defeats in track and field events, lost to Tianjin in basketball, and were defeated by Zhejiang in volleyball. Therefore, the team, with no other records, had already left Hangzhou and returned to Jiangxi yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Consistency</p>
<p>In the 10,000m race, the last one was Shao Wenlong from Ningbo Fourth Middle School in Zhejiang. After everyone else had finished running, Mr. Shao still had two laps to go. At this time, in the square, thousands of eyes were on him as he ran alone. However, Mr. Shao remained calm and unhurried as he advanced, eventually reaching the finish line. Chairman Dai Jitao said when the 10,000m race was halfway through that if anyone could finish the entire race, even if they were the last one, he would personally award a gift to encourage their consistency.</p>
<p>▲ Women's Misfortune</p>
<p>During men's sports, except for injuries on the field and internal illnesses, there is always the possibility of exercise. However, if female athletes are forced to exercise when their period suddenly arrives, the damage they suffer may be ten times greater than natural illnesses. In this conference, some female athletes from various provinces and cities were unable to participate due to their period, or were forced to exercise due to their circumstances, resulting in most of their results falling behind. This is truly the misfortune of female athletes.</p>
<p>▲ Harming People</p>
<p>After the female short-distance running general Sun Guiyun won first place in the 50m and 100m finals, fellow athletes all congratulated her and asked to treat them. Ms. Sun was also beaming with joy and finally agreed to their request. Yesterday, she treated her guests, which spread quickly. The athletes all knew that anyone who won first place had to treat others, and even those who won second or third place could not avoid it. Therefore, athletes in the venue were constantly asking for treats, and the sound could be heard everywhere. Those who were hit said that Sun Guiyun was harming people.</p>

<p>▲ Miss Sun Sheds Tears</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the women's 200m relay race, the referee suddenly announced that the first and second places were indistinguishable, and Guangdong and Harbin, etc., had to rerun today. Ms. Sun Guiyun burst into tears upon hearing this, shouting "I'm so angry!" and refusing to race again. It was also said that she did not eat dinner that night. People were quite worried, as the lady had already cried and starved herself. They were afraid that other steps would be taken, and the referee could not bear this great responsibility.</p>
<p>▲ Turpentine Oil's Magical Effect</p>
<p>Harbin athlete Ms. Sun Guiyun has been in the limelight. Readers only know that her results are outstanding, but they do not know where it comes from. It turns out that the first time the lady appeared on the field, Huang Jingwan applied turpentine oil to her legs. As a result, she won first place. She was very grateful to Mr. Huang. From then on, she would always ask Mr. Huang to apply oil as usual, and it never failed. Mr. Huang and others followed her before and after, serving her diligently, and prided themselves on the effectiveness of applying oil to the lady, considering it a supreme honor. In recent years, they have considered this the most enjoyable thing in social situations.</p>
<p>▲ Playing Along</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, when the second half of the first football match began, a yellow dog suddenly appeared in the Jiangxi camp. It chased the ball and ran left and right, greatly hindering the progress of the players. The sound of applause shook the entire field.</p>
<p>▲ Fence-Sitting Psychology</p>
<p>The venues inside the conference are either connected or separated. Those in separate venues cannot pass through unless they purchase a general ticket and must purchase another ticket. However, those in the highest-level seats in the grandstand of each venue can see from Venue A to Venue B. Clever people often try to get this position as quickly as possible, which can kill two birds with one stone. According to the speculation of those with keen minds, the psychology of such people mostly belongs to those who are fence-sitters.</p>

<p>▲ Third Session Results</p>
<p>The first two sessions of the conference did not have specific rules regarding various competitions, participating groups, and scoring methods. The Third National Games, held in Wuchang, Hubei in 1924, can be considered the official National Conference. Xiong Bingsan was the chairman, and Zhang Boling was the chief referee. Except for swimming and baseball, which were overseen by Westerners, the rest were managed by Chinese personnel. Participants included the East China, North China, Central China, and South China regions. The Overseas Chinese Youth Association of Little Luzon also sent a basketball team to participate. All sports followed the rules of the Far Eastern Games. The results of the competition were as follows: East China won football, baseball, and tennis doubles; North China won track and field, basketball, and tennis singles; Central China won swimming; and South China won volleyball. Based on the above calculations, East China and North China each won two and a half championships, with the same results. According to the regulations of the Far Eastern Games at the time, when the results were the same, the team that won the track and field overall championship would be the overall champion of the conference. Therefore, in the Third National Congress, North China was first, East China was second, Central China was third, and South China was fourth.</p>

<p>The volleyball team sent by Fujian to participate in the National Games this time, with the private Fujian Academy as the basic representative team, has excellent skills. When the team arrived in Hangzhou, it had several friendly matches with the Zhejiang team, the Liaoning team, and the Tianjin team, and won all of them. As for the Shanghai team (i.e., the Fudan-based representative team), it was defeated by the Fujian team. Today, the Fujian team officially played against the Tianjin team (Nankai-based), which had won the Zhejiang team with scores of 21 to 3 and 21 to 7 (second match). The Tianjin team was also defeated by the Fujian team, with scores of 21 to 13 and 21 to 5. From this observation, the Guangdong team, which has caused a national sensation, will compete with the Fujian team on the 8th of this month (semifinals). Both teams can be called strong rivals.</p>

<p>Biological Research Institute Enters Sichuan to Collect Specimens</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Biological Research Institute of the China Science Society has achieved remarkable results. This spring, Director Bing Nongshan specially dispatched a collection team to enter Sichuan on a large scale to collect specimens. The team is divided into animal and plant groups. The plant group is led by Mr. Fang Wenpei, and the animal group is led by Mr. Xu Xifan. Mr. Fang is a graduate of Southeast University with a degree in agriculture and has a lot of research on plant taxonomy. He is also from Sichuan and has been sent by the institute to collect plants in Sichuan twice before, so he is very familiar with the situation in Sichuan. Mr. Xu is a graduate of Xiamen University with a degree in science and has discovered five new species of parasitic roundworms, a new species of jellyfish, and a new subspecies of armored turtle. He has also been sent by the institute to collect in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal areas of Fujian twice, so his knowledge and experience are also very suitable. The Ministry of Education highly approves of this move by the society. In addition to issuing passports, it also informed the Sichuan Provincial Government to instruct the troops stationed in various parts of Sichuan Province to provide practical protection for the collection team. It is also heard that all sectors of the military and political circles in Sichuan have always admired the society's undertakings, so this time they will provide financial assistance to the collection team to enable the team to achieve greater results. The Ministry of Health of the National Government, the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Central Research Institute, the Lin Yuan Committee of the Premier, and the Xiaozhuang Rural Normal School have all made special commissions to the collection team and provided them with financial assistance of 500 yuan each. The Beijing Jingsheng Biological Survey Institute has also specially dispatched two collectors from the institute, Mr. Tang Jin and Wang Fazan, to join the collection work. It is heard that the plant group of the collection team has already entered Sichuan two weeks ago, led by Mr. Fang Wenpei. The animal group only set off yesterday to enter Sichuan because Mr. Xu Xifan had just returned to Beijing from collecting in Fujian.</p>

<p>▲ Participating in the National Boy Scout Grand Review in Nanjing</p>
<p>Fujian Jimei School has always been known at home and abroad for its boy scout training. It is now learned that the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee is convening a national boy scout grand review. The school will send 60 representatives from its naval and land boy scout troops to participate in Beijing. They are scheduled to depart from Xiamen in early April, led by the school's Boy Scout Corps Leader Yuan Zheng Lai, instructor Leng Xueqiao, and trainee instructor Chen Meiqing to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, they will stay for a short period before joining boy scout representatives from other parts of Fujian to go to Beijing. The boy scout circles in this city, upon hearing this news, are already preparing to welcome them, etc.</p>

<p>The Newspaper Staff Children's School, since its opening, has achieved remarkable results. In less than three years, it already has 330 students, divided into nine classrooms. Currently, during the spring break, it is implementing off-campus guidance. The academic director Ye Yunhua and various teachers are leading all the students on a trip to Longhua, and also visiting the orphanage, where teachers Yang, Zheng, and Jin are providing hospitality. The internal layout is very perfect. The boys' section has rattan, bamboo, woodworking, and shoemaking departments, while the girls' section has cooking, sewing, and embroidery departments. The achievements in all these areas are extremely excellent and truly admirable. Finally, they also went to the Hundred Steps Bridge Catholic Church Garden. They departed at 1 p.m. and returned to school at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>▲ A Fierce Wife — You say the man goes out at night. Is it really a person or a ghost?</p>
<p>A Henpecked Husband — I'm unlucky to be a person. If I were a ghost, you'd be afraid of me.</p>
<p>▲ Woman A — Oh my, why is your house in such a mess? It seems like you're missing quite a few things. Are you moving soon?</p>
<p>Woman B — No. My daughter is getting married soon. She thinks many things are hers, so she's packing them all up.</p>
<p>▲ Woman — No matter how beautifully you speak, how much you say you love me, I don't want to marry you. The husband I want to marry must be upright and generous.</p>
<p>Man — Then you might as well marry the redwood Eight Immortals table left by my great-grandfather. Nothing could be more upright or more generous.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Detailed Record of the World Tour Group's Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Regarding the news of this world tour group arriving in Shanghai from the United States, although various newspapers have published it briefly, they were not detailed. Now, based on Western newspapers, I record the details to enrich this talk.</p>
<p>The tour group, traveling the world on the German-American Hamburg Company's Resolute ship, arrived in Shanghai at 9 a.m. on April 1st. The number of people was as many as 383. After arriving in Shanghai, they first traveled by car through the International Settlement, and then by rickshaw to tour various parts of the city. After the tour, after 12 p.m., they went to the Astor House Hotel for lunch. That night at 8 p.m., they set sail for Qinhuangdao to tour, etc.</p>
<p>The leader of the group is Captain Cruise, a famous traveler who has traveled around the world as many as ten times. His experience in traveling is self-evident. Since the departure of this tour group, it has passed through as many as thirteen countries, such as Canada, Argentina, Spain, Brazil, Cuba, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, Austria, Germany, and Romania, etc., all of which have been visited. The members can represent twenty-nine states and seventy-nine cities and towns in the United States. The number of people is truly rare.</p>
<p>When the tour group was in Shanghai, although the time was limited, when these people were dining at the Astor House Hotel, the hotel specially set up a temporary shop to display various rare items and antiques for the members to choose and purchase. When these people passed through Nanjing Road, the stores were immediately filled with customers and became extremely busy, especially silk and embroidery shops, which were particularly busy, because most of the tour group liked to buy these items.</p>
<p>This tour group departed from New York on January 6th. The majority of the members were Americans, totaling 330. There were 16 Germans, 12 British, 12 Argentinians, 3 Swiss, and one or two each from Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Rosenberg, the Netherlands, Romania, and Spain. From now on, they plan to go to Beijing, Seoul, Kobe, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Osaka, Honolulu, San Francisco, Los Angeles, the Panama Canal, and return to New York on May 27th. In addition to the scheduled itinerary, if convenient, they also plan to visit islands, famous people's tombs, and the Himalayas in various places.</p>
<p>Among these 383 people, 224 are male and 159 are female. If we statistically calculate the age of each person, the average is 49 and a half years old. The youngest is Miss Bai Long, who is only seven years old, and the oldest is Mr. Bai Lunga, who is 78 years old this year. The difference between the old and the young is 71 years, and they are also two important roles in the tour group.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Anecdotes from the National Games <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yaguang</p>
<p>When the Games opened, important figures from the National Government were all present, such as Chairman Chiang, Dai Chuanxian, Chu Minyi, and Wu Zhihui, each of whom gave a speech. Chairman Chiang's speech was particularly earnest, repeatedly stating his points in a voice as loud as a bell, until he was exhausted and hoarse. This showed his emphasis on the mission of this conference. The athletes were all moved, and those who had come from afar, such as Liao Ning, also applauded to express their welcome.</p>
<p>Among all the female athletes, they all had short hair and stood up straight. Only one woman from Liaoning had a single braid, which caught everyone's attention and was called a "maverick" of the whole field.</p>
<p>There were vendors in the field selling paper cup ice cream. At this time of chilly spring, if the athletes drink a few cups after being tired, it may easily lead to illness, which seems to be unsanitary. I sincerely hope that the authorities will improve this.</p>
<p>The female athletes are fiercely majestic and do not yield to the men. It is expected that the results will not be bad. In the track and field events, Wang Yuan of Harbin is the most promising, as he has repeatedly won championships in the preliminary selections. Let us wait and see.</p>
<p>The public buses can directly reach the entrance of the venue, and the price is also cheap. However, on the first day, because they were preparing to welcome all the athletes in the auditorium at night, many buses stayed and did not carry passengers. The general public, who were not athletes, were all complaining.</p>
<p>The merchants in Hangzhou, this year, in addition to the incense market, have a large number of tourists. Everyone is happy, saying that this is a good phenomenon after the Party's rule. After the exposition, this is the second grand gathering.</p>
<p>In addition to the male and female athletes showing off their good skills, the busiest in the field are the general photographers. At the sound of the gun, they rush to take pictures of the first and second place winners, and quickly mail them to the Shanghai newspapers. Their enthusiasm and courage are truly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Phoenixes Fly Together to Western Shores <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Yu</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Shiqi from Shexian, Anhui, is a talented and extraordinary young man, an expert in fine arts. His wife, Ms. Yang Manhua, is beautiful and intelligent, with calligraphy and painting skills that match her husband perfectly. They are truly rare talents from our hometown. Mr. Xu recently works in the Ministry of Health of the National Government and has been specially sent by the Ministry as an inspector to Europe, and also serves as a solicitation committee member for the National Exposition Representative Office. He will set sail on April 5th. Mrs. Manhua has aspirations for a grand tour and will accompany him to see the sea. In the future, when they return, they will surely add weight to the motherland. The twin phoenixes in the clouds will fly to the West. All friends are competing to give them a farewell feast.</p>
<p>▲ Against the Wind. On March 27th, maritime celebrities such as Ge Gongzhen hosted a public banquet for Mr. Xu at the Dahua Hotel, celebrating his mission to a foreign country and his wife's accompanying him to study fine arts. They knew that I was not a casual friend of Mr. Xu, so they sent invitations to share the grand occasion. However, I had to go to Hangzhou for business and returned to Shanghai that afternoon at 4 p.m., unable to join the feast. Although I will invite Liang Meng to Jinlong Restaurant tomorrow to make amends, the crime of arriving late is unforgivable.</p>
<p>▲ Sincere Gifts. Mr. Xu, feeling that he will be leaving the country soon and will not return for more than a year, invited ten close friends, both male and female, to a dinner party at his residence on Xin Zha Road on the 31st. The food and wine were certainly abundant, but Mei Qu believed that the guests were all the best of their time, and the two hosts were sincere and refined, like a first draft of the Huangting Sutra, just right, the flavor was truly beyond the food and wine. Mr. Xu and his wife had a collection of collaborative calligraphy and painting, which they had solemnly presented to me the day before. The sincerity of the gifts was at its peak.</p>
<p>▲ Why Envy Immortals. This was what Mei Qu said to me after the gathering on the 31st. Mei Qu had only met Mr. Xu once, more than three years ago. This time, Mr. Xu solicited paintings to prepare for participation in the exposition, and unexpectedly obtained a portrait of a lady by Ms. Mei Qu's son, Yunhua. Mr. Xu said, "She was my top student when I taught at the Meizhuan in the past. At that time, she only studied Western painting, but now she studies national quintessence. Such rapid progress is admirable. Therefore, I also admired Mei Qu's literary talent and asked me to send her a local invitation to the meeting that day. Mei Qu admired the elegant and peerless couple, their art and talent surpassing the crowd. She said to me, "Can you not write a poem for the two beauties, Xu and Yang, based on the line 'I only envy mandarin ducks, not immortals'?"</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Comedy of Yushan Also Being Called Niushan <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chu</p>
<p>I once traveled to Yushan in Changshu with a friend. Someone asked me, "Have you ever heard that Yushan is also called Niushan?" I said, "Mencius said that the trees on Niushan were once beautiful. That mountain in the state of Qi must be in today's Shandong Province. I have never heard of Yushan in Changshu having that name." Someone else said, "It exists. Yushan is named after Zhong, while Niushan refers to its shape. Niutou (cow's head) refers to Ziyou's tomb. Niujiao (cow's horns) refers to Xinfeng Pagoda. Niuhou (cow's rear) refers to the Laoshi Cave. There is also a Niuwei (cow's tail) that was broken off by Qin Shi Huang's whip. The relics still exist today. The cow is so huge that it refers to the entire city of Changshu as a barrel for feeding the cow." These words are extremely humorous, and Changshu scholars can all say them." I heard these words and dared not believe them. Later, I saw a Yushan Ballad by Mr. Hu Shiyu of Kunshan, which was a travel poem, printed in oil and shown to friends. Yushan Ballad is one of them. Reading it can verify the above. The poem says, "Although Yushan is small, its name is known throughout the world. I have never heard of replacing Yu with Niu. Now I ride a bamboo sedan chair around the mountain, and the chair carriers chatter and bother me. Their words are strange and baseless, let us just say it and just listen to it. They say that this mountain is named Niu after its shape. Niutou refers to Ziyou's high tomb. The entire city carries it as a barrel for feeding the cow. Xinfeng Pagoda stands tall like two horns. Niuhou expels arrows at Laoshi Cave. The tail below is suddenly broken off and should feel pain. In the past, the Qin Emperor Shi Huang drove the cow to Xihu (West Lake), but the cow would not rise. (Shanghu is also called West Lake) He raised his whip and roared with a thousand pounds of force, striking down and breaking off its tail. Its tail is slightly distant and forms a small hill, which is now submerged in the wilderness. Why not go and see it to prove my words? It is only a mile or two ahead. The words of the rustic men of Qi are wonderful. I also casually spoke and almost lost my laughter. The wind on the seven waters of Qinchuan is cold, and I face the cow and play ancient tunes."</p>
<h3 id="e196">Casual Talks in the Capital <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shuwen</p>
<p>Over the years, driven by hunger, I have wandered aimlessly, drifting like tumbleweeds, and struggling in hardship. Recently, I left Hangzhou and entered the capital, where I plan to stay for a while. What I have seen and heard has given me mixed feelings. I am writing this with a pen, and the article starts and ends by itself. I am not making a fuss about nothing, nor am I seeking to develop a great work. I write when I am inspired, and I do not continue at a fixed time. I do not dare to be different, but I want to preserve the truth. I am writing casual talks.</p>
<p>Those who talk about the lack of repair in the capital's municipal administration often attribute it to the incompetence of the authorities. If we discuss it fairly, with such a large and dilapidated urban area and the current financial constraints of the city treasury, it is not easy to talk about construction. Let alone wanting to imitate London and New York in an instant. However, without a definite plan, no事业(shi4 ye4) can be achieved. The chaotic and unsorted state of the capital's urban area cannot be reformed and improved in a short period of time. If we can assess the situation and establish a long-term plan for a hundred years, and with the efforts of the authorities and the assistance of the people, we can improve things in order of urgency, then after a few years, there will be a significant change. And the key to the grand plan should be to decide on the road system first. Otherwise, if orders are changed in the morning and evening, and decisions are uncertain, the people will doubt and hesitate and dare not invest. Even if the authorities can make efforts, what will it help the development of the city? The road system in the capital has been planned several times and has only recently been decided. It was officially announced the day before yesterday. From now on, there will be a path to follow and hope for construction. The investors of the people will also have a guarantee of safety. Is this not beautiful? I deeply hope that after the authorities have made a decision, they will be able to abide by it permanently and not make any more changes. Then New York and London will have a day to emerge in the East. I feel that the announcement of the trunk road system by the Capital Construction Committee is a great event for the capital, and I record it as such.</p>
<p>Among the famous scenic spots in the capital, the ones in the city are not as good as the suburbs. In the city, places like Mochou and Qinhuai are either ruined and dilapidated or have become noisy markets. Jiming and Beiji are also ugly due to poor decoration. Those that are worth climbing and glancing at are all outside Stone City. The depth of Qixia Mountain, the seclusion of Yanziji, the majesty of Zhongfu, and the simplicity of Houhu (i.e., Xuanwu Lake) are the most famous. Others, such as Niushou Mountain, Yuhua Terrace, Longtan, and Shizishan, are all worth seeing and can be used for sightseeing. However, apart from these, there are still places that are extremely secluded, particularly charming, and have not been noticed by people, such as Xinglin outside Taipingmen. The place is located at the foot of Zijin Mountain, three miles away from Taipingmen. There is a vast expanse of flat land, with apricot flowers lining the road, interspersed and meandering. Following the slope into the mountain, near the third month of spring, the jade-like apricot flowers are in full bloom, covering the mountain and creating a magnificent view. At the end of the apricot flowers, it is right at the陰(yin1) of Zhongfu. The deep valleys and high mountains are inaccessible to birds. Walking with Laiyi, scooping up泉水(quan2 shui3) and drinking it, whistling and wandering in it, all worldly worries are cleared away. I went there with Wu Zicheng and sighed at the beauty.</p>
<p>▲ Correspondence. In the "Free Talk" published on April 3rd, there was a section called "Female Chicken Turning Male," signed Fei Gongzhi. Is this the same Xiang who was in Hangzhou and tested養氣(yang3 qi4) with Dahe at Zhang Gongci and gave me a silk painting of a lady? I have not seen him for thirty years and miss him very much. If he is an old friend, please forward the address through Shou Juan. Thank you very much. Chen Diexian.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Blazing Flames Reaching the Sky, A Filial Daughter on the Balcony; Red Carpet on the Ground, Meeting Famous Actors on the Spot</p>
<p>In that play "Worse Than Going Home," the most important person playing the leading role of the prodigal wife is... didn't they say that in their Qingliu Society, there are two people who are good at playing young ladies, one is Jiang Xiaoxia and the other is Ou Yuqing? But Jiang Xiaoxia is still in Japan at the moment and has not returned to China. He is studying fine arts and aspires to go to France. France is the source of European fine arts. He wants to prepare for their fine arts academy, so even just looking at it with his eyes will increase his knowledge a lot. But Ou Yuqing went back to his hometown after returning to China. It turned out that he was from Liuyang County, Hunan. During the Reform Movement of 1898, Liuyang produced two martyrs, one was Tan Liuyang and the other was Tang Liuyang. Talented people were born in the land, and the small Liuyang became famous. Ou Yuqing's father was also an official. He was also from a scholarly family. After returning to China, he had to return to his hometown to visit his relatives once, so he was not in Shanghai either. But in this play "Worse Than Going Home," there was already a specific person playing the prodigal son. This person's surname is Ma, and his style name is Jiangyou. When it comes to looks and acting, Ma Jiangyou is not as good as Jiang Xiaoxia and Ou Yuqing. But he has a special feature, because he is good at acting in tragedies. And the heroine of "Worse Than Going Home," the prodigal wife, has a very deep lung disease. Ma Jiangyou also has a very deep lung disease. One side of his face naturally carries a pale and bloodless look. He doesn't even need makeup. He naturally has a face of tuberculosis. Therefore, he is most suitable to play the heroine in this play. Only his voice is not very sharp and has a bit of a crying tone. It is very unsuitable in other plays, but it is not a big obstacle in this tragedy. He performed it once when he was studying drama in Tokyo and received a lot of praise. They have now arrived in Shanghai, so they chose to perform this play "Worse Than Going Home" because Jiang Xiaoxia and Ou Yuqing are not in Shanghai. Only Ma Jiangyou is here, so they chose this play. Secondly, they discussed the issue of location. At that time, the voice of so-called reformed drama in Shanghai was loud. They called those vernacular dramas without gongs, drums, or strings "civilized dramas," also known as "civilized new dramas." Adding the word "civilized" above shows that the old dramas were not very civilized. But from the perspective of people with a little knowledge, the so-called civilized dramas are also limited in civilization. No matter who it is, without any practice, they jump onto the stage and shout and jump around randomly. People who understand a little bit of the superficialities give a speech to the audience, as if they are teaching people in general. The rest is incoherent and he doesn't even understand the plot. He doesn't even know what's going on. There are such theaters in Shanghai. There are also all kinds of scenery, and there are even rotating stages. They often use "Large Rotating Stage" to publish large-character advertisements to promote a group of ladies to come and see.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Gold Standard Continues to Fall <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold standard continued to fall, but the highs and lows changed suddenly by two taels. Fellow merchants bought and sold according to their own needs. Hengxing, Yuxingyong, Shunli, and others all made purchases. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Yu Da, and others all sold. Foreign exchange showed a slight easing, with listed prices returning to their levels. The early morning market saw large bars lengthening, opening low, but buyers were strong. Datong and other firms absorbed spot standards, so prices rose leisurely by two taels. At noon, sellers flocked in, pushing the market down by more than two taels. Exchange rates weakened, but ultimately the short sellers covered slightly, raising prices again by a little more than one tael. Sentiment remained uncertain. In the afternoon, the market closed as usual for the weekend.</p>
<p>▲ Opening fell by 1.7 qian. British silver bars have returned a quarter, and silver prices have risen by half. The initial opening price for the May gold standard was 500 taels and 0.08 qian, down 1.7 qian. Gross profit immediately rose by more than one tael, to nearly two taels. Buyers were numerous. Banks bought spot goods, and foreign exchange initially weakened but later stabilized. The Bank of Japan bought 1.053125 taels and bought June British gold at 11 pence 25. The shilling rose by .25, the American dollar increased by 5 jiao, and the Japanese yen was listed at .0125 lower. The market was able to hold, with prices at 502 taels and 2.2 qian. Internal exchange rates were stable. Datong and Huayi did a June Citibank at 47 yuan. Later, Dalian gangs bought in, and the spot goods were actively digested, so prices rose again by two. By about 10:30, it was at 2.9 qian.</p>
<p>▲ At noon, various firms disposed of their holdings, falling to the lowest level of .03 qian. Yuanmaoyong and others offered limited-price silver bars for sale, and various firms also disposed of their holdings. Forward-month British gold saw Sumitomo buying at 11 pence 3125, and Datong selling near-term at .125, so gold prices fell sharply, dropping 2.56 qian to 500 taels and 0.03 qian at 11:30. Selling began to subside, Datong and others continued to buy spot, and prices rose again by 1.0 qian to 1.34 qian. The price was then suppressed by 4.5 qian, but at noon, the market closed at 501 taels and 1.4 qian, down 1.1 qian compared to yesterday. The maximum price in half a day was 502 taels and 2.9 qian, and the minimum price was 500 taels and 0.03 qian, with a difference of 2.6 qian. The listed price was changed to 511 taels and 8, due to the Japanese yen listing lower by .0125. The listed price was about 10 taels lower, and the accounting and water replenishment were both 501 taels. The opening price of goods was 501 taels, and the closing price was 501 taels and 1.4 qian.</p>

Guangdong merchants bought more and sold less, seemingly increasing their positions. Other firms had irregular buying and selling, but there were no large quantities, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Weekend Shanghai Tael Market Slightly Improves <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>▲Market Overview: The day before yesterday, due to abundant sources and dwindling demand, coupled with sluggish bank sales, buying and selling were moderate, causing the tael market to turn downward. People's sentiment was unusually weak. Yesterday, there were still outgoing paths to the outside world, although not many, which was enough to attract attention. As a result, people's sentiment slightly improved, and transactions became slightly more frequent. Banks' appetite also slightly strengthened. However, Saturday afternoon is the routine closing day, so it was slightly lackluster.</p>
<p>▲Tael Exchange Rates: The "Foreign Tael" opened at 7 qian, 2 fen, 0 hao, 1 hu, and 2.5 si in the early market, and at 7 qian, 2 fen, and 0 hao, and 2.5 li in the afternoon market. Compared to the previous morning price, it was roughly 3 hao and 7.5 si better. However, the current appetite is not strong and transactions are particularly lax, so the tael price is unlikely to rise suddenly. The "Silver Discount" opened at 1 pi in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was 2 fen higher than the previous day. The dividing numbers remained unchanged and marked in white.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan Small Dollars opened at 6 qian, 1 fen, and 7 li and a half in the early market, which was half a li lower than the previous day. The afternoon market fell another 1 li, reaching 6 qian, 1 fen, and 6 li and a half. The transaction volume was 3,000 jiao in the early market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong Small Dollars opened at 5 qian, 9 fen, and 7 li in the early market, and 5 qian, 9 fen, and 7 li and a half in the afternoon market. As a result, it was only 2.5 hao lower than the previous day's early market. The transaction volume was 130,000 jiao in the early market and 55,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 3,000 wen, reaching 395,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds": Yesterday was Saturday, and bank receipts and settlements were routinely scarce. Chinese merchants' receipts and settlements of paper money were over 1.6 million, foreign merchants' receipts and settlements of paper money were 1.23 million. Receipts and settlements of various freight, tax, and miscellaneous funds were also small, only over 6 million. Telegraphic transfer funds were over 400,000, and outgoing warehouse funds were 1.4 million. Japanese banks' receipts and settlements of various funds were over 3.1 million, and outgoing warehouse funds were 300,000. Money shops and silver public houses' receipts and settlements were slightly more due to the fifth-day comparison period, totaling over 33.3 million. Head-splitting funds receipts and settlements were over 3.4 million, and receipts and settlements of funds from various routes were over 800,000, and cash receipts were over 1 million. "Foreign Funds": Remittances and paper money transactions in the early market amounted to 1.32 million, and banknotes were 10,000. Remittances and paper money transactions in the afternoon market amounted to 870,000, and banknotes were 30,000. In addition, over-the-counter banknotes were 45,000 in the early market and 133,000 in the afternoon market. Spot dollars were 52,000 in the early market and 75,000 in the afternoon market. (Both British dollars and new coins are included, because it is impossible to investigate and analyze them separately, so they are recorded together.) Bank transactions amounted to 550,000 in the early market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. Receipts and settlements between foreign accounts of various banks were over 1.2 million, and banknote inflows and outflows were over 1 million. Money shops' foreign public house receipts and settlements were over 4.5 million, and foreign head-splitting funds receipts and settlements were over 800,000. Foreign currency lending was over 900,000, and small money shops' transactions were over 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Reasons for the Stagnant Sale of Foreign Funds <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>This year, the inflow and outflow of foreign funds from other ports has been extremely quiet, far less prosperous than in previous years. The main reason for this is mostly due to the impact of the current situation and the obstruction of transportation. In the northern route, due to military relations, commerce has invisibly stagnated, and there is naturally no need for purchases. Even if there are outgoing shipments, they are nothing more than military supplies. In the southern port, due to sluggish exchange and consumption, the use of foreign funds has also felt delayed. What is currently being shipped is purely British dollars and two types of new coins, just to embellish the market scene and to supply the demand for Hong Kong dollars in the relaying ports. In past years, the Hankou port should have been in the peak season for all kinds of goods, and the use of funds would have been most frequent. Unexpectedly, it is now in the scope of war, so it cannot be launched. Therefore, the current source and demand are minimal. Yesterday, only over 200,000 arrived from the Yangtze River, 300,000 were shipped from the northern route, 300,000 were shipped from Hankou, 200,000 new coins were still shipped from the Guangdong gang, 30,000 British dollars, and 150,000 spot dollars were shipped to the interior, prepared as rice funds.</p>

<p>The yarn market trend is relatively stable and firm, so people's sentiment is slightly better. However, overseas cotton yarn market prices are declining, and few people are gathering in the business district. In the afternoon, the market was closed due to customs restrictions. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 630 bales throughout the day, with 100 bales coming from fellow traders. Prices rose by 2 qian and a half. Among the customer gangs, the Guangdong gang bought 100 bales, Xiamen 40 bales, Xuzhou 25 bales, Niuzhuang 125 bales, Wuhu 20 bales, Jiangxi 120 bales, Shantou 40 bales, the interior 20 bales, Ningbo 20 bales, Tianjin 130 bales, Zhenjiang 20 bales, and Hankou 10 bales.</p>

<p>▲English Indian Cotton Slightly Rebounds Firmly</p>
<p>▲American Cotton Ends Lower: Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to buying by the same industry, but then fell due to profit-taking. The futures price fell by 18/32 pound-tones. English cotton futures rose by 15 to 19 points, spot prices rose by 11 points, and Egyptian cotton rose by 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but then softened due to local short selling. The near-term and long-term price of Pingguoer rose by 3 rupees. The near-term and long-term price of Aomula rose by 2 rupees. The near-term and long-term price of Bailuoxi rose by 3 rupees. The original telegraph recording is on the left. (4th telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e205">Oil Market: White Tung Oil from Hankou Drops Continuously <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The rise and fall of white tung oil depend on whether there are transactions from foreign firms. This has been the custom for nearly ten years and has not changed slightly. This time, however, it slightly deviates from the norm. Half a month ago, the transaction volume of foreign firms was originally not large, and domestic sales also stopped due to the end of spring sales. The market was silent and there was no possibility of development. However, it suddenly rose sharply like a dragon from the sky. The reason is that although there was continuous rain this spring, the spring water upstream of the Yangtze River did not rise, resulting in a gradual decrease in the source in Hankou. Therefore, a slight transaction can easily trigger a price increase, and the lack of inventory everywhere can also lead to an increase. At that time, domestic sales were slightly prepared for inventory everywhere, and the business in Hankou saw the situation of rising prices due to the thin inventory. The transaction of foreign firms was handled up to 26 taels and 7 qian according to foreign regulations, but only dozens or hundreds of tons. Domestic sales in Hankou also sold up to 21 taels and 6 qian according to foreign regulations. After this increase, the prices in Zhejiang also increased to 34 yuan and 8 jiao and 35 yuan per dan for river delivery. However, the increase was not at the right time, it was just a flash in the pan. In the recent three or four days, a telegraph from Hankou came, saying that tung oil had arrived, and the market immediately turned flat and weak. Yesterday, the telegraph reported that a foreign firm sold 500 tons of May futures oil for 25 taels, 7 qian, 5 fen and 7 qian, which had already fallen by about 1 tael. According to the arrival of more goods, it is also expected that it will fall again. If the mountain in Shandong collapses, the bell in Luoyang will respond, and it is feared that it will be difficult for Zhejiang oil to maintain its price.</p>

<p>New Sichuan mustard tuber has now been launched. The first batch of over 700 jars arrived yesterday, but the samples have not yet been seen. It is expected that the initial market price will be high, but it should be relaxed later. The existing stock of old goods is not thick. The current market price is 35-36 yuan, and the secondary ones should be reduced accordingly. The trend is flat.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Sugar Market: Raw Sand and White Market Have Turned Flat <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegraph indicated that the current price of Cuban raw sugar was still 1.875, the May price of New York futures sugar was 1.67, which was 2 points lower than the previous telegraph, the September price was 1.77, the December price was 1.84, and the March price next year was 1.89, which were all unchanged from the previous ones. The current price of Javanese raw sugar was 10.625, and the May and June futures prices were both 10.875, which were also unchanged from the previous ones. In the public market, the atmosphere of 24th grade raw sand white sugar from the Netherlands turned flat, and the buying atmosphere was even more silent due to Saturday. The market was asking for 7 taels and 2 qian and a half, and the 20th grade medium sand white was 7 taels and 1 qian, both of which were rarely handled. Although finely ground white sugar was traded slightly at 7 taels, 3 qian and 2 fen and a half, the market was also flat and weak. Japanese sugar transactions were also very desolate, and the market situation was also depressed. N Mark was 7 taels and 8 qian, YT Mark was 7 taels, 6 qian and 2 fen and a half, YP Mark was 7 taels and 8 qian, and J Mark was 8 taels, 0 fen and 3 fen and a half. The demand was very scarce. The number plate only opened 33 packages of domestic cotton lake red at 7 taels and 6 qian per yuan. Because the market stock was very thin, the market situation still felt stable and beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Silk and Tea: Thin Stock of Dry Cocoons, Prices Tend to Rise Further <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>▲The Upper Body Goods Must Be Pulled at 1,156 Taels Net</p>
<p>The stock of dry cocoons in this port has long been unable to continue to be new. Now, the demand for high-quality A-grade silk from England and France is quite strong. However, the upper body dry cocoons on the Shanghai stock are increasingly scarce, so the asking price is rising. The cost of spring dry cocoon silk from Hangzhou and Shaoxing is 1,156 taels per bale, plus about 1,400 taels for reeling workers, making it difficult to sell. Although the foreign exchange rate rose yesterday, the price of silk was not high. Chinese merchants were very reluctant to sell. Only Mitsui and others imported 50 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, Lianna imported 20 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and Samsung imported 10 bales of yellow silk. The price is still firm.</p>

<p>The tea market in this port has recently been in a state of silence. Both the British and French firms have too much of the precious eyebrow and beautiful eyebrow goods purchased last year, which is difficult to sell out, and they are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Although Russia has been negotiating on Gongxi green tea these days, the recognized price is only 24-25 taels, which is less than half of the cost. Even if Chinese tea merchants want to sell it painfully, it is quite difficult to comply.</p>

<p>The trade association in this port was originally the only group of foreign firms' tea business internally and externally. Since the National Army established its capital in Nanjing, various industry groups have gradually corrected themselves. In order to comply with the regulations for the correction of commercial groups promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the association has decided to change its name to the Shanghai Foreign Firm Tea Trade Association from this month.</p>

<p>▲Xie Liheng is Good at Treating Measles: Last winter was very cold, and now spring is still chilly. The toxins of coal smoke and fire stoves are breathed into the body and are difficult to expel, so there are many measles in children, which are both serious and dangerous. Dr. Xie Liheng from Ningli, North Zhejiang Road, is famous for his good treatment of measles. Whenever he encounters a dangerous case, he often comes up with a unique method to turn danger into safety. For example, the granddaughters of the world-renowned Ren Yixu Xiaoxu, Weng Yousan, an employee of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, and Liu Baisheng, the captain of the Sanbei Company, all recovered completely from dangerous and severe measles.</p>

<p>Ms. Hu Suying and Ms. Wang Huali: Anyone who has seen the 25th anniversary parade of China Public School will surely notice a pair of roles performing a double act. One is a lively, cute, and interesting Fengyang woman, played by Ms. Hu Suying, and the other is a dull and earthy Fengyang old man, played by Ms. Wang Huali. Ms. Hu has never participated in any school activities. Somehow, she actually performed on stage at the parade that day. Her lively figure, her skillful performance, her fluent lines, her clear throat, and her interesting makeup, even her every move, every word, and every smile, all aroused the audience's cheers. When she performed to the right place, the entire audience held their breath and there was no sound, like the quiet atmosphere of the believers in the church listening to the pastor's etiquette report, which also showed the amazing art of Ms. Hu. The Fengyang old man played by Ms. Wang was crude and stupid. From her makeup of the figure-eight beard and her dull and rude expression, we cannot see that she contains the slightest identity of a daughter. Her humorous wit, her wonderful dialogue, and Ms. Hu just made an excellent foil. The two ladies have indeed made considerable achievements in the study of art.</p>
<p>The Establishment of the Women's Basketball Team: Since the China Public School basketball team participated in the Jiangnan Six University standard competition, it won the battle against Jiaotong University and then won the battle against Chizhi University. Therefore, the China Public School basketball team, which was known for its awkwardness, began to be noticed by the general public in society. Recently, the school authorities, feeling the silence of the female students' sports, organized a female basketball team this semester. A few days ago, the newly organized China Public School female basketball team held its first establishment meeting in the school's gymnasium. Lei Yueqin was elected as the team leader, and Li Hanyanwen was elected as the clerk. From then on, whenever the evening sun sets and the evening breeze is cool, we often see a group of female generals wearing red and green, flying skirts and dancing sleeves, performing their best skills on the female basketball court. How strong is their interest! (Jiang Ping)</p>

<h3 id="e216">The Mock Court of Great Xia University <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Universities with law departments should naturally have mock court practices as part of their curriculum; it's not some particularly novel or unique initiative. However, although our university, Great Xia, has had a law department for several years, this is our first attempt at mock court practice. This semester, after hiring Mr. Jiang Zhensan to teach a practical course in civil procedure, he used his extensive experience to diligently prepare for the court session and ultimately achieved his goal. It is said that the audience was particularly enthusiastic when the mock court opened on that day, and all parties were fully prepared, engaging in eloquent debates, creating a grand scene. Those who were present even forgot that it was a mock court, and the excellent results in the future are certainly to be looked forward to. Regrettably, the author was unable to personally attend the grand event due to other matters on that day, and still feels regretful when thinking about it.</p>
<p>The case heard by the mock court on that day was determined in advance by the professor in charge. It involved three brothers, Zhang Yi, Zhang Bing, and Zhang Jia. Zhang Yi was adopted into another family as a child. Later, Zhang Yi had no son, and before his death, he established Zhang Jia's only son, Zhang Geng, as his heir. The inherited fertile land of three thousand acres, a residence, and a city property were all inherited and managed by Zhang Geng. Zhang Bing's eldest son, Zhang Wu, claimed that Zhang Geng's inheritance as the only son to continue the lineage was illegal, as he had three brothers and should inherit Zhang Yi's lineage. The inheritance should also belong to him, so he filed a lawsuit in court. Zhang Geng also argued that his inheritance was based on the fact that he was of the same lineage and could inherit multiple ancestral temples, and that Zhang Wu had borrowed one of the city properties left by Zhang Yi and should return it to him. All parties presented their cases to the court, and the question was how to judge the case.</p>
<p>In addition, the characters in the court on that day and those who played the roles were also assigned in advance by the professor in charge from among the students. The list is recorded below: Judge Wu Linkun, Judges Chen Xinghua and Yan Hanqing, Clerk Tu Kunfan, Prosecutor Yang Huilong, Court Officers Ban Guihua and Lu Jingyuan, Plaintiff Lawyers Wen Dairong and Liu Zhiquan, Defendant Lawyers Wang Shuxun and Shen Ergu, Plaintiff Li Yanpan, Defendant Qiu Zhendong, Interested Parties Zhang Jia, Qian Langxi, Zhang Yi Zheng Tigan, Witnesses, Witnesses in the Plaintiff's Inheritance Document, Zhou Zhengli, Lin Mingzhong, Zhu Dihua (Zhi Jing)</p>

<p>Golden Theater Premieres "Buddha's Enlightenment" - The Golden Grand Theater announced that the film "Buddha's Enlightenment" depicts the compassionate deeds of Buddha Shakyamuni's life on the one hand, and denounces the extravagance and licentiousness of the Sadohan Royal Palace in India on the other. It is truly a good remedy for the prevailing frivolity, indulgence, and shamelessness of recent times. The Golden Theater has been premiering this film for several days, perhaps also out of concern for the declining state of the world's morality, it is said. ▲ Wei Lie Film Company Goes to Hangzhou to Shoot News - Wei Lie Film Company announced that its manager, Mr. Hong Weilie, led a team of assistants to Hangzhou a few days ago to shoot news footage of the National Games. They will return to Shanghai for processing in about a week, so that it can be supplied to various cinemas for screening, it is said. ▲ "The Three Great Heroes" Has Been Filmed - Xifan Film Company announced that its twelfth production, "The Three Great Heroes," is directed by Mr. Hu Zongli and stars the up-and-coming female martial arts star Wang Feijuan. The play is a martial arts romance drama, and Wang's martial arts and performance are remarkably impressive. The play features flying swords and scientific electric light battles, and the filming techniques are quite novel and unexpected. The interior and exterior scenes of the play have been filmed, and the company is now rushing to produce subtitles and editing, and will be ready for a preview screening soon, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ South Palace Drama Society Established - The South Palace Drama Society announced that it held its founding ceremony yesterday at the Baixing Xilai Society. Sixty members attended, a mix of men and women, making for a very lively occasion. The entertainment segment in the program added a lot of color, especially Ms. Xin Ruiying's lullaby, which was sung with a beautiful voice, like a new oriole emerging from the valley. Mr. Pan Shiju's "Cinnabar Mole" had accurate articulation and clear pronunciation. Mr. Yang Deyong's portrayal of a beggar was also excellent, imitating the "Mao Mao" tune with humorous lyrics, making the audience laugh. By the time the meeting ended, the city was ablaze with lights. The committee members of the society have been selected as Mai Mengxia, Mao Bixin, Xiao Jianqing, Pan Shiju, and Yu Fengzhi, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Flying Girl Song and Dance Troupe to Hold Inaugural Performance - The Flying Girl Song and Dance Troupe announced that it was organized by Mr. Wang Junwuqi and will hold its inaugural performance on April 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th at the Guanghua Grand Theater at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Messena. The troupe will also perform new songs, including "Her Heartless Serenade," it is said.</p>
