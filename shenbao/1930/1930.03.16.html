<p>前昨兩日之海會。形勢確已險到極處。吾人所冀一線轉機之望者。全繫乎各國能臨機覺悟之一念。以今日消息觀之。似已有共圖轉圜之象。或亦即覺悟一念之發現歟。</p>
<p>當海會初開時。一般輿論。均料日美間之爭執。爲該會最大之危機。蓋其時日本堅持七成之說。早已宣傳於世也。迨開會以後。兩方始終執持堅决態主。並未稍露接近之點。乃於今日會議將告破裂時。而日美間交涉忽有發見妥恊曙光之說。即爲力圖轉圜之一證。倘果能因此曙光。而得解除日美之爭點則該會太平洋方面之難關已過。不可謂非意外之幸。但日本外交政策與海軍當局主張。向不一致。如海軍方面。不肯犧牲七成主張。以遷就幣原外交之意見。則轉圜仍將無望也。</p>
<p>至歐陸方面最大之難。關爲法意間之爭持。前日法代表白里安以會議已無希望聲言將即日離英。但至今日。非特未離英。且與意代表作一度會談。可信法意間亦有力圖轉圜意。惟會談之結果。法代表尚不願發表。意代表則微露未有進步意。是法意間之爭點。能否銷釋。亦尚未可必也。</p>
<p>美總統胡佛今日發表宣言。謂深信倫敦會議已在設法進行中。亦是表示希望共圖國圜之意。蓋使此會議而果决裂者。則影響於世界前途甚大。危機所伏不可究測故於該會議將瀕絶境之際。各國要人。必能轉念及此。於是此共圖轉圜之機運以生。實可謂爲初步之覺悟。然此共圖轉圜之機運。最後能否成功。則又視各國覺悟之程度何如。懸崖勒馬而不遲廻。前途庶乎有望矣。</p>

<p>日美交涉有新進展</p>

<p>路秀社十五日倫敦電、泰晤士報稱、海會美日代表已獲美滿諒解、現有理由可信日本八吋砲巡艦噸數、可以十萬八千四百噸爲限、而美國八时、砲巡艦、則爲十八萬噸、但日本海軍在潛艇與驅逐艦上、可得更大的比較力量、約及美國所需要者百分之七十至八十、以八吋砲巡艦言、美國可有十八艘（即十八萬噸）英國可有十五艘（即十五萬噸）日本十二艘（即十萬八千四百噸）、東京覆電一星期後可到、但可望日政府同意云、</p>
<p>電通十四日倫敦電　日本要求補助艦對美七成、爲日美交涉之焦點、此次美國提出新案、其内容如下、（一）八吋砲一萬噸巡洋艦、美國始終主張維持十八萬噸、即十八隻、意欲日本佔六成、（二）關於補助艦總括的七成、美國則稍稍讓步、已到接近七成之程度、（三）對於保有潛水艦現有勢力七萬八千噸之要求、則提議以六萬噸爲度、蓋對輕巡艦及驅逐艦、承認比較的多額之比率、以期接近總括的七成、對八吋砲大型巡艦、則固持當初六成之意見、對潛水艦數字上表示若干之讓步、而與日本主張之主要點、仍大懸隔、雖爲日本所不滿、然垂已接近到相當之距離、不能拒絶、目下暫觀會議全體之形勢、隨謀善後之法、惟美國方面屢催日本决定態度、李特全權於十三四兩日三訪若槻松平兩全權、日本則須愼重考慮、尚未表示意思、正電政府請訓、總之會議漸有轉機、</p>

<p>第二件新加坡新總督金文泰解散國民黨支部事現在這件事已經引起全國國民的注意、同時英國國會裏對此亦提出質問、足見此事性質的重大了、查新加坡總督金文泰、於二月二十日、請新加坡總支部第二屆執監委員、到督署談話、他認爲國民黨部的存在、有礙英國的主權、限一月以内、將新埠的黨部、一律撤銷、外交部接到報告以後、就立刻電達駐英公使施肇基、和駐新加坡總領事唐榴、分别提出嚴重抗議、現在英國外交部已經致電金文泰查詢、並對該督辦理此事未先呈報認爲不合、此事不久當可望解决、關於荷屬南洋靨迫黨員事、外交部已經電令駐爪哇總領事、積極交涉、</p>
<p>第三是交涉撤消荷屬蘇門答臘强迫華工事、查荷屬南洋的法律、對於東人本有强制工役的規定、從前各地都有此項規定、近來爪哇各島、已經取消、惟蘇門答臘各地尚未取消、把東地方有所謂强迫救火制、凡屬華僑、由地方當局、指定遇有該地火災、應到塲救火、如果不到、須科二十五盾以下的罰金、或二十五天以下的拘禁、在拉哈地方、華僑每年應納十五盾的修路稅及打更稅、否則施以强迫苦工、現在修路稅等、經我國領事的積極交涉、已經取消、至於把東的强迫救火制、外交部已經令駐巨港唐領事、積極交涉、不久也可希望取消、</p>
<p>第四是修約的問題、中國古巴間的友好條約、現在由駐古巴公使凌冰、與古巴政府積極接洽中、外交部已經呈請國民政府、任凌公使爲簽訂友好通商條約全權代表、中希條約、希臘政府已經批准、中日關稅協定、已經王外長宋財長與日本代辦重光在薩家灣外交官舍、議定草案、俟請示兩國政府後、即可正式簽字、至於報載協定的内容、並不確實、關於收回威海衞租借地問題、英公使蘭浦森、已將協定草案、寄倫敦請示、英政府的訓令、尚未接到、等訓令到後、協定就可正式簽字、關於中美公斷條約、現在已經期滿、由駐美伍公使與美接洽續訂、日前伍公使將續訂條約草案、寄部審核、外部以條文上尚有不妥地方、曾電令令公使與美政府接洽修改、現在伍公使已有電來、謂美政府已同意修改各點、外交部接到報告後、已電伍公使、命彼進行簽訂手續、第五中美懸案兩起、已經正解决、這兩件完全是民國十二年的事情、一件是十二年五月間美兵在河北省　縣槍殺苦力張林、經外交部迭次交涉、犯兵已經美國軍事法庭判决監禁終身、賠償被害家屬美金一千元、另一件是十二年二月美兵在漢口打靶、流彈誤殺童子湯煥牙、現賠償被害家屬美金一百元、這兩筆欵、已經由美國公使詹森交由外交部轉發被害家屬、這兩件表面上看、似已延遲太久、其實美國政府對於預算、十分注意、無論多少格外的開支、必須經過國會的通過、然後才能撥付、因爲周轉的手續太多、所以遲延至最近、才告結束、</p>
<p>第六關於保護在華外僑問題、最近發生幾件狠不幸的事情、一件是芬蘭傳敎士三人、在廣東被土匪綁去、一件是荷蘭傳敎士在安徽被刦、一件是廣亦龍州法國領事爲共匪架走、外交部除已分電各該省主管當局、極力營救外、已經轉咨軍政部、請通令全國各軍師、以後務須注意外人生命財産之安全、加以格外保護、軍政部現已據情轉令各省駐軍遵照辦理、</p>
<p>第七現在外交部和司法行政部已經進行收回上海法租界會審公堂的交涉、關於這個問題、外交部已經照會法公使、大約不久就可正式討論收回的辦法了、此外關於中國在國際方面的活動、亦值得報告一下、外交部接到國聨會秘書處的通知、謂國際仲裁保安委員會、已定本月二十四日在日内瓦開會、請中國派代表出席、我國的代表現在尚未派定、第十四次國際勞工大會、已定六月十日在日内瓦開會、中國亦將派代表參加、駐法使館呈報國際微菌學第一次大會、定本年七月二十日在巴黎開會、該會秘書長已正式函請我國屆時派正式代表出席、外交部已致函衞生部核辦、法國航空宣傳委員會長利屋德、正式通知我國駐法公使高魯、謂該會定今年十二日在巴黎召集第一次國際航空安全大會、討會科學上實施上航空之安全、世界各國將被邀出席、並請我國贊助、現外交部正與軍政交通兩部核議辦法、國際統計會議定本年九月在日本開會、已正式函請我國派代表出席、屆時我國當由主管統計機關派員參加、捷克斯拉夫代表照會我國、請我國派代表參加第一次國際刑罰會議、現在外交部已經請司法院核議、」</p>

<p>青市建設事業、席德日兩國經營之遺礎、宜若有成績可觀、乃自接收以迄現在、不惟無進步可言、即維持現狀、亦因經費拮据、而呈江河日下之勢、茲就青市之水道林業及馬路工程三項、調查其年來建設之概况、報告如下、</p>
<p>（一）水道　查德人於一八九八年租借青島後、即開始經營自來水工程、日人繼管青市、仍續行開闢水源、安置水道、迄我國接收時、共有水源地三處、計一李村水源地、每日可製水六千餘噸、二白沙河水源地、每日可製水六各噸、三海泊河水源地、每日可製水九百噸、水管一項、全市均安置普遍、滄口四方等處、亦能流通、故市民對用水一項、極稱便利、近年人口增加、市炎局又新在白沙河下游另闢水源地一處、刻正在裝置機器、預計每日可製水三千噸、即屆春旱之時、亦不致用水缺乏、惟德人所置之水道機器、迄今已三十餘年、其水道鐵管之壽命、祇有十三年、水源地機器之壽命、只有四年、現在爲未雨綢繆計、自應設法預儲欵項、以爲更換新管及機器之用在民國十六年時、曾擬年儲二十五萬一千一百元、爲更換新管經費、卒以經費支絀、未能實行、聞更換德置機器水管、共需一百四十萬、日置機器水管共需一百八十五萬元、</p>
<p>（二）林業　青島以童秃不毛之山、經德人以全力造林之結果、蓊鬱青葱、遂以風景佳麗名於世、計德人投資於青市林業者、爲一百五十二暪金馬克、有官林三萬七千三百餘畝、農田三百五十餘畝、公園十六處、民林五千九百餘畝、森林之布置植造、實足爲我全國模範、日管時代、每年撥欵三十餘萬日金、繼續擴充、尚稱進步自吾國接收後、因絀於經費、僅能維持現狀、而每年用於農林之費、祇五萬九千餘元、故農林事務所雖屢有擴充計劃、未能實行、聞該所擬於今年在勞山造林一百五十畝、並將於總理逝世紀念日先添造三十畝、以事提倡、</p>
<p>（三）馬路工程青市馬路工程、極爲精進、而市内各路、尤爲整齊清潔、現在市内馬路約計共三百餘里、合一百八十萬平方米達、内柏油路面者三十三萬平方米達、市外通勞山李村沙子口滄口等處之馬路、約計亦在三百華晨以上合八十七萬平方米達、接收以後、新築阿斯法油馬路十四萬平方米達、沙石路一萬餘平方米達、每年馬路工程維持費、約十二萬餘元、青市之建設事業、惟此項比較的尚有成績、而現在僻遠各路、亦正在計畫添築也</p>

<p>王部長訓詞　吾國地大物博、甲於全球、而生産事業、比較各國落後、實因國内資本缺乏之故、蓋資本缺乏之原因、約有三種、（一）未能建立國家資本、（二）未能調劑社會資本、（三）未能集中個人資本、如果能將國家資本、社會資本、人民資本、交互集合、則各項事業、定必發達、現值訓政時期、生産有利事業、實最切要、客歲、本部考察專員、前赴歐美日本、見各國之版圖人口、類不及我國遠甚、而國民經濟之發達、實有一日千里之概、即以郵政儲金匯兌一事而論、亦採近人萪學上分工原則、設立專局、悉心辦理、故與郵政全體事務、相輔並行、其進展發達、遂無限止、於是採集成規、反復討論、經奉國民政府曁行政院核准、而始有斯局之設立、籌備迄今、垂三個月、始得開幕、又承各界人士寵賜宏文、並承日本等國貯金匯業總署、先後函賀、贈送儲匯資料、以供參考、曷勝榮幸、溯吾國設立郵政、垂三十餘年、其初隷於海關、迨前清末葉、方離海關而獨立、遂有長足之進展、此次儲匯設立專局、亦爲郵政開一新紀元、將來與郵政分工合作、前途未可限量、此可爲預期者一也、郵政機關、遍設於各地、辦理儲匯、自易普及、將來提倡得法、足引起一般民衆之儲蓄心、而養成其儉德、此可爲預期者二也、吾國幣制、向未統一、整理財政、極感困難、郵政勢力、散在各省、對於各省内地幣價匯兌、日常處理、較爲明晰、故於將來政府統一幣制之工倂上、本局當有絶大之貢獻、此可爲預期者三也、本局人員、皆愼選銀行專家、合原有郵政經騐人員充任、關於金融之挹注、業務之拓展、當較有把握、將來與歐美郵政事業、並駕齊驅、亦意中事、此可爲預期者四也、不過我國辦事、往往易趨於官僚化、本局業務進行、宜用科學方法、力求商業化、社會化、此最宜注意者也、凡辦一番新事業、莫不由艱艱締造而來、吾人當具堅苦卓絶之精神、以爲奮鬭、實踐秘生主義、此則伯羣與在事諸君、所當共勉者也、</p>
<p>劉總辦答詞　今日爲本局開幕之期、蒙部長親臨訓誨、書蕃等異常感激、竊惟郵政儲金匯業總局之設立、關係極爲重要、嚮者中國每興一事、常恃外資以爲挹注、馴至權利喪失、負擔增加、國家經濟、瀕於破産、而中國人民固有之資財、反寄存於外國銀行、言之可爲慨歎、此種現象、固由國民愛國心之薄弱、然亦吾國無穩固機關、足使人民信任、遂至於此、郵政之設、普及各地、其性質亦極永久、地球不没、而郵政亦必存在、以營業機關而論、郵政最爲穩固、果能因勢利導、其進展殊未可限量也、此次本局設立之目的、舉其大者、約有三事、（一）使人民與政府生連鎖之關係、人民以血汗之資、託之國家機關保管、國家之休戚、即人民自身之休戚、則一切内爭外侮、皆無自而興、（二）打破民衆信任外國銀行之觀念、郵政擔保、旣經確實、而辦理方法、尤當力求完善、將來挽回利權、定必不少、（三）聚全國散財、助國内實業之發展、所有外資、悉皆不用、爲利之溥、何可勝言、凡此皆全國郵政人員、共抱目的、務求達到、以副我國家曁部長殷殷之希望焉、</p>
<p>林總辦祝辭　頃間聆聽部長訓詞、及劉總辦答詞、對於設立郵政儲金匯業總局之目的·及籌備之經過·十分詳盡、鄙人於此有兩點感想、（一）郵政局設全國今以專局辦理儲金匯兌事務可以集中全國資本、發生生産事業、並可調節民生、實是實現總司民生主義的重要建設、（二）可以提倡人民儲蓄之興趣·及儉約之美德、以蘄合此次三中全會决議案之精神、蓋國家旣設立一可以信任的機關、人民就敢放心儲蓄、從前鄙人在西北時、親見人民將銀或埋地下·或藏櫃中·甚至消費殆盡、此皆因無穩靠儲蓄機關、有以致之了、設立郵政儲金匯業之目的、旣在分工合作、故郵局同人·與儲匯局同人、應當共同努力、彼此本是一家、自無畛域、能就合作途徑、切實進步、則我郵政全體之發達、寗有限量、各國郵政的情形、便是明證、今日爲郵政儲金匯業總局開幕之日、希望兩局同人、能本此精神做去、以副政府曁部長之望、謹祝、</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑  海客　　子丨父親。今天學校中修身敎師對我們說。我們到這世界中來是帮助别人的。　父丨是啊。這句話一些也　不錯。子丨那麽别人到這世界中來又是幹甚麽的呢。　　修琴匠丨先生。我是修琴的。特來瞧瞧你的批亞那壞在甚麽地方。主人丨我的琴並没有壞。我又没有喚過你。修琴匠丨先生。是你珮兩隔壁的高隣喚我來的。　　甲丨你夫人昨天分娩了。生的是男呢還是女。乙丨不是田就是女。不是女就是男。未必會生下一頭畜生來呢。　　妻丨我們的孩子呆頭呆腦的。目前不該給他娶妻。夫丨天下娶妻的人都是呆頭呆腦的。妻丨你今天回來時。帶一個捕鼠機回來。人丨我前天不是已買一隻麽。妻丨但是已有一頭鼠子夾住在内了。甲丨請你借機個錢給我吧。我們已相識了五年了。乙丨恕我不能借給你。甲丨爲甚麽。乙丨就爲的相識了五年。我已知道你的脾氣了。記汽車環游全世界之一對法國夫妻  黄影呆　　最近有法國年輕夫婦。用汽車周游全世界。業於日前抵滬。妻名杜西斯Ｏdette　Darthys。夫名萊可爾Ｒoger　Lacor。之二人者。乃法國著名之藝術家及運動家也。法國各地人民。殆莫不知此夫婦之大名。上星斯五。夫婦乘麥迪生總統號來滬。擬轉道往日本。抵日後。將用汽車周游日本各地。以完成一部分大陸之旅行。杜西斯乃著名藝術家。此次以汽車周游全世界。並非完全出於即奇之心。蓋一方在考察全世界之陸路行程。俾將來對於藝術界方面。得以有相當之貢獻。萊可爾爲駕車能手。年僅二十四歲。其在汽車競賽會中。不知曾造成多少新紀錄。而其中最足引入注意者。厥惟在一九二七年至一九二八年由賽哈拉至巴黎之長途旅行。此盛大之汽車競賽會。乃由法國汽車俱比部所主持者。當此夫婦抵滬之日。上海泰晤士報記者。即前往訪問。據云夫婦二人。對於此次汽車周游世界。得以有如此之成績。深表滿意。蓋彼等自去年七月九日。與巴黎汽車俱樂部同人宴别後。所經路程。已有數千英里。所有各種危險。確已經過不少。即人跡絶罕之地。亦已經過多處。如以彼等所經之地而言。則自法蘭西出發後。經意大利。巨哥斯拉夫。保加利亞。土耳其。西里亞。卑路支。達馬士喀。巴夫德。印度。印度支那等國。彼等至美國後、。萊可爾將略事逗留。而杜西斯則已應好來萊塢某影片公司之聘。將攝製一有聲影片云。到南翔去  蘭茜　　時光過得眞快。去年總理逝世四週紀念路局舉行樹樹典禮於眞茹。曾幾何時。現在又已是五週紀念了。　　今年也像去年一樣。備有專車一列。載我們到南翔去。南翔比眞茹遠了一點。要跑三十分鐘才到。　　因爲天雨關係。參預者只有一二百人。就在南翔站上。懸着總理遺容及其他種種標語。哀樂奏過後。花圈獻過後。我們聽着。幾位先生循例的演說。還是那篇哀感頑艶的祭文讀得動人心絃。使人神經興奮而欷歔愁嘆。　　晦冥天地。風雨凄其。在這一種陰沈緊張的空氣中。每一個人都憑弔着我們這位爲中前途而犠牲一切私人的幸福的總理。我儀悵懐着。總理逝世已五週年矣。後死者曾對於國家有過什麽貢獻。新舊軍閥們還是蠢蠢思動。國民生計日見艱苦。得不着些兒慰情。總理在天之靈。也該非常悽惶而不安吧。然則。今日的微雨。點點滴滴或都是來自總理的雙眸間的了。　　我們於悲戚之中。請勿忘我們每一人的應有的天責而黽勉自勵。而努力革新吧。　　今年種的是冬青樹。泥士鬆潤。不像去年那般堅硬。有幾位女職員。還是扭扭揑揑地種了幾株。一方面又怕着脚下的爛泥沾污了伊們的黑漆皮鞋子。那眞是有趣的點綴。　　天雨致不能攝影。十點餘鐘我們重復上車。茶役們忙於應付茶點之分配。遂把飲食間演成一齣道地的滑稽劇。請你看吧、幾十位平素甚爲「斯文」的先生們。在這時便左手把牛奶之杯。右手握雞蛋之餅。猝狼吞虎嚥。快其朶頣。不幸者。給人家倒得滿身牛奶。乒乓一聲。又去了一個玻璃杯。接着又是一聲「慢慢着」。小小一個車廂。直把現社會的一切生活盡態極妍地顯現由丨他們都要奪取麵包和水啊。　　不久。車已到上海。大家各作鳥獸散。面上堆着一副似笑非笑的神態。敎我没法爲之狀其一二。女后薈萃之滬江  絜　　日昨訪友楊樹浦滬江大學。談笑之餘。訊得瑣聞數則。錄之於後。　　女權極形伸張　滬大男女同學有年。校中各種團體組織不乏女生職員。本學期女同學尤占學生自治會中重要位置。本屆自治會全體代表大會主席及執行委員會副主席並言論部部長等職。均屬女同學擔任。惟聞代表大會主席鄭女士。以事務繁多。有無暇就職之勢。已呈請辭職云。　　皇后薈萃之區　申浦各著名女學生多升學於滬大。故該校竟成爲海上各校女皇后薈萃之區。現肄業於滬大者。有崇德皇后。晏摩氏皇后。清心皇后。羣后爭長。而滬大之皇后。究屬何人。質之滬大學生亦啞然也。　　五百年前是一家。滬大同學。集李氏同姓者。組一李氏大同盟。不分省别。無論山東李河南李浙李兩廣李聚首一堂。哥哥姊姊弟弟妹妹。儼然一大家族。前日外交次長李綿綸先生到校。李氏大同盟。竟以其姓李大開歡迎會。亦可謂實行五百年前是一家之佳話也。（却酬）人皮裝訂簿面之日記  國新　　美國波士頓藏書樓中。有一最名貴之書一冊。其書之名貴處。非因内容之可寳貴。而在其書之裝訂。裝訂維何。即書面之包皮。係人皮所製也。　　相傳有愛倫Ｊames　Allen其人者。在一八二五至一八三五年中。爲大盜。往來於新英吉利Ｎew　Wngland與麥塞邱賽茲州Ｍassachusetts兩地。受其蹂躪者、以萬計。當道竟莫如之何。至一八三六年。始被獲下獄。即於翌年瘦死獄中。死後身畔有遺囑一紙。及自記其生平之日記簿珮冊。遺囑略謂。一介匹夫得威震數百里。横行十餘年。死何足惜。留有日記兩冊。雖不足流芳。然亦可遺臭。死後可將吾皮囊剥下。用作此日記兩冊之封皮云云。典獄者以此旣爲死者之願。遂從之。此書原爲兩冊。現祇遺一冊。其他冊則已不知去向矣。南洋游記（八）  靈花　　下午至一華人基督會。參與禮拜。鄭牧師云。此地有華人自立敎會三處經費自籌。聽一美人講道。能說粤語。云世界無一處無廣東人。上海十年前有十萬廣東人。今有二十萬矣。所以我多年專學廣東話。也成廣東人。在滬辦一廣東敎會學校。有學生四五百人。今天講的最要便同爲人類。同爲兄弟姊妹。天下一家。切不可說我是外國人。我也不說你們是外國人。只是一愛字而已。但我想孔子云。四海兄弟。天下一家。在二千前究竟是玄學。非用科學組織。將國界種界消去。勞資公平調和。方能實現。否則在敎堂說是一家。出去還是實行階級戰爭。國家吞食。兄弟之言。不過猿猴撈月而已。吾甚望凡熱心宗敎者。須了解近無科學社會主義之方法。而不爲玄學鬼也。　　四時。焦校長以汽車二輛邀游七畫公園。車行約二十分而到。車價一元半。經過法人所立中學。云安南人可入。望之規模亦可觀。七畫者。人名也。公園規模不小。大于上海法公園。可三倍。内有河流。小輪游行。園公開不收費。但我南京公園自公開不收費後。内面反不潔凈。亂人自由出入。反不如從前收費八銅元。尚可限制下等雜人。蓋立法之寛嚴。亦視乎辦法耳。園内老樹高大。綠樹陰濃。夕陽西下。法人士女熙熙。行樂於此。而土人來者。不見甚多。惟拉車者不少。汽車亦自由行於園中。轉驚游客矣。有大象二。尚不如萬牲園之大。有馬猴甚兇猛。黑熊不數頭。其畜法以斯門汀爲窩。有洞有木架。從一面可發自來水。洗其穢爲最要也。鶴鷺小鳥小猴不少。可怪者未見鸚鵡。尚不如萬牲五色鸚有數十架之盛矣。有一虎。頭果有黑痕。似王字。其畜法圍于期門汀牆中。牆上有尖釘。牆亦不甚高。可一丈五尺。虎不時向衆張牙而不屈。英雄末路。拿破侖之囚于大西洋孤島中。殆此類乎。心上温馨（一四九）  包天笑　　第九回　諸名士閧笑捉迷藏　一嬌娘任情施擁護　　這個時候。便發生了一個問題。在甄翠霞以爲我已捉到了一個人。他的義務已盡。至於老太婆小娘唔。他可不管了。他早已拉下了紮没眼睛的手巾。在許多人。以爲老娘姨不在我們這個捉迷藏團體以内。而且伊的推門進來。是突如其來。出於我們的不意。捉住老娘姨是不算數的。要甄翠霞重捉。還有一個滑稽提議。說是旣捉住了這個老娘姨。就敎這老娘姨來捉。也不要緊。老娘姨聽見發急了。說阿呀。你們在這裏捉盲盲嗎。我是四五十年不曾捉過盲盲了。又有人提議。這是素君家的老娘姨。應該敎素君來代替。素君當然不肯。說這關我什麽事。又有人說。素君不肯。敎鄭七少來代替素君。鄭七少自然也提出抗議。後來時觀平說道。儘捉下去。也没有什麽意思。敎老娘姨捉。這是一個滑稽議案。當然只好撤消。敎素君和鄭七少代替。這個議案不免太苛。甄翠霞終算捉到了一人。暫告休息。諸君興猶未盡。可以再捉兩回。若是興致已盡。也可以憂然而止。現在天也漸漸夜下來了。素君不是已有堂唱來了嗎。其餘他們也都要回去。重行化裝一番。照常的做他們夜間工作。我們也可以適可而止了。大家都也覺得興致已盡。說不必再捉了吧。只有怡情老四撅起了嘴唇。說算我倒霉。我倒捉得很吃力。你們却就此不捉了。嚴一塵道。這捉迷藏的事。也就是你引出來的。你說捉迷藏怎樣的起勁。所以請你先試捉一回咧。這時一髮牽而全身動。因爲素君有堂唱要去。伊跟了那來喚伊的老娘姨先去了。許多姑娘們。也紛紛要回去。從這一天上。便約定了他們來拍小照。那個金釵十二圖。不久也便拍成了。那時光已近初夏。西商賽馬的日子。也就在這幾天裏。明鏡俱樂部正對着跑馬廳。正四月清和綠肥紅腴的時光。望過去一片綠油油的草地。好似由大自然的手裏。織成了一幅全綠的大地罽。鋪在那裏。人家天衣無縫。它正是地衣無縫。這個景致。看看也覺得賞心悅目。有人說綠的顔色。最足以養目。現在從明鏡俱樂部的二層樓上。推窗一望。很可以資游矚。偶然有幾個西商。在草地騎着馬馳行。正是金勒馬嘶芳草地。玉樓人醉杏花天。到了賽馬的日子。自然越加熱閙。</p>

<p>Yan Has the Intention of Staying in Shanxi to Continue Responsibility</p>
<p>(Beiping) The government announced a telegram from Shang Zhen and twenty-three other generals on the 13th, preventing Yan from going abroad and awaiting punishment in the army. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Taiyuan stated that Yan, due to the earnest support of his subordinates, indeed intends to stay in Shanxi and continue to take responsibility. The direction of progress will be discussed in the coming days. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wen Shouquan went to Shengyu to explain the key public matters on Yan's orders. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaogu came to Beiping from Shanxi. Yan additionally sent Liu Duoquan, a staff member of the headquarters, to Shenyang to meet with Zhang. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The World Evening News reported that Yan and others would arrive in Beiping in about a week, and the Northwest Army is expanding towards the Longhai and Pinghan railways, with six divisions being transferred out of Tongguan. It also reported that Chen Gongbo had arrived in Tianjin, and Wang Zhaoming would be coming north, and so on. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters received a telegram from Zhengzhou, stating that Yan falsely claimed to be going abroad to deceive the people of the country. Confirmed reports from various sources indicate that he convened a meeting of senior military officers in Shanxi and decided to gather his troops and advance southward along the Pinghan and Longhai railways. The previous withdrawal of troops to Shandong and Henan was a conspiracy to gather forces and plan a counterattack. Recently, he allowed Feng to enter Shaanxi and command the Northwest Army, urgently recruited eight security divisions in Chahar and Suiyuan to expand his strength, and sent personnel to Shanghai to order large quantities of flour, secretly deploying spies in various parts of Beijing and Shanghai, all of which prove his preparations for war and resistance. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Official telegram from Beiping: (1) Yan, lately aware of the perilous environment, and with various parties sending letters and telegrams questioning his dispatch of troops, has decided to withdraw the Shanxi troops heading south and will withdraw them to Shijiazhuang in the shortest possible time. (2) The generals of the Northwest Army held a genuine military conference, with the majority advocating for the support of the Central Government, saying that China is full of thorns and that if they break away from the Central Government and side with reactionary elements, it would only prolong the internal strife and increase the suffering of the people, and that the glory of the Northwest Army's efforts for revolution would be swept away. (3) Yan's representative, Zhao Pilian, went to Shenyang to meet with Zhang Xueliang to report that Yan had ordered the northern withdrawal of the Shanxi army heading south, and would retire and go abroad, determined not to cling to power, and asked Zhang to mediate everything with the Central Government on his behalf.

<h3 id="e5">General Headquarters Quartermaster Meeting <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Headquarters Quartermaster Meeting held its opening ceremony and first general meeting at the Quartermaster School on the morning of the 15th. The first group meeting was held at 2 PM. Chiang personally gave a speech, stating that the three essential elements of the army are command, sanitation, and management, with management being particularly important. All quartermasters must bear corresponding responsibility and should not be like the accountants of warlord times. Now there is a revolutionary government above and revolutionary soldiers below. If there are corrupt and dishonest officials in the middle, they will certainly not be able to exist and will be overthrown. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Wu Chaoshu Arrives in The Hague <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from The Hague on the 13th, reporting that he arrived in The Hague on the 7th and had already instructed Xie Weilin of the French Embassy and Liang Yunli of the American Embassy to serve as expert commissioners to assist in attending the conference. He requested that they be dispatched accordingly and that Wang Nianzu and Xue Shouheng of the Dutch Embassy be transferred as secretaries. The conference is opening today, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' position paper has not arrived. He will uphold the points advocated in the Party Headquarters' telegram, and regarding nationality, he intends to declare that the naturalization procedures of various countries should be limited to punish a certain country's abuse of registering Chinese people for naturalization. He will also declare that the existence of unequal treaties makes it doubly difficult for China to protect foreigners. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Prelude to the Mongolian and Tibetan Conference <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Mongolian and Tibetan Conference being prepared by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, April 1st was originally set as the opening date of the general assembly. I recently met with a certain gentleman responsible for the commission, who said that since the arrival of the Mongolian delegation leader Heling and others in Beijing last year, they had been in contact with the central government for a long time on the political issues of Mongolia, but due to various obstacles, the results obtained were limited. Therefore, in order to understand the actual situation on the border in order to set a standard for governance, and for the various Mongolian leagues and banners to communicate with the central government so that all political issues can be satisfactorily resolved in order to improve the welfare of the Mongolian people, the large-scale conference was convened, which is of great significance. However, initially, due to the changes in the Northwest Army, representatives from Qinghai and other places were unable to travel. Subsequently, due to military incidents between China and Russia, traffic in the Northeast was blocked, causing representatives from Hulunbuir and other places to be unable to pass through. Therefore, the conference has been postponed repeatedly. At the moment, the various leagues and banners of Tibet have already held a preparatory meeting and formulated a complete plan, which will be brought by the representatives for discussion at the general assembly. The majority of representatives from the various leagues and banners of Eastern Mongolia have already arrived in Beijing and Beiping. If traffic on the Pingpu Railway is unimpeded, they will travel south by train. If the train is obstructed, they will come south by sea. As soon as the number of representatives reaches fifty, which is enough to form a quorum, the conference can be held as scheduled. Even if it is postponed, it will not be more than ten days or half a month away. If Chairman Zhao Daiwen is unable to come to Beijing at that time, Deputy Chairman Ma Fuxiang will be responsible for presiding over everything. It will definitely not be affected or stalled by the situation, so as not to disappoint the Mongolian people. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Report of the Railway Ministry Advisor's Inspection of the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Menter, advisor to the Ministry of Railways, reported on the current state of the Pinghan Railway and the points that should be improved for the ministry's reference. 1. The railway is in arrears of more than 92.74 million yuan in loan reorganization fees and wages, and it is quite difficult to maintain. This is actually because warlords have controlled the railway administration over the years, arbitrarily appointing people with no commercial or economic knowledge as directors, and it has often been affected by military disasters, so it has been impossible to develop. In the future, if we want to reorganize, we must adopt strict measures in management, appoint railway employees impartially, and strictly abide by the railway administration regulations. If this is done, after two or three years, the railway can collect 40 million yuan annually. After allocating half of this amount to the reserve fund and depreciation items, there will still be a surplus of 20 million yuan each year for reform, so there is no need to worry about insufficient funds. 2. The road maintenance works on the railway are extremely deficient. Only 9% of the sleepers can still be used for another five years, and the remaining 91% are mostly damaged. The steel rails are also mostly curved and unstable, often causing train derailments. These must be replaced successively within these five years to avoid accidents. The Yellow River Bridge project will be difficult to accomplish during these five years, but it must be maintained extremely carefully and repaired carefully so that locomotives with lower traction can pass safely and slowly. Most of the locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars of the railway have flowed into other routes. There are currently 65 locomotives in existence. These vehicles are extremely old and mostly damaged, and their load capacity is also very limited. 75% of them (accounting for a load capacity of 25,346 tons) should be discarded immediately, and new vehicles should be purchased to increase transport capacity.

<h3 id="e14">The Sea Conference Attempts to Turn the Situation Around Together <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Sea Conference of the past two days has indeed reached an extremely dangerous situation. The only glimmer of hope for a turnaround that we expect is entirely dependent on the ability of all countries to realize the situation at the opportune moment. Judging from today's news, there seems to be a sign of jointly attempting to turn the situation around. Perhaps it is the discovery of this moment of realization.</p>
<p>When the Sea Conference first opened, general opinion was that the dispute between Japan and the United States would be the biggest crisis of the conference, because at that time, Japan's insistence on the 70% ratio had already been widely publicized. However, after the conference began, the two sides consistently held firm positions and did not show any signs of rapprochement. Today, when the conference is about to break down, there is suddenly news that the negotiations between Japan and the United States have shown a glimmer of compromise, which is proof of an attempt to turn the situation around. If this glimmer of hope can indeed resolve the dispute between Japan and the United States, then the Pacific obstacle of the conference has been overcome, which can be considered an unexpected stroke of luck. However, the diplomatic policy of Japan and the views of the naval authorities have always been inconsistent. If the naval authorities are unwilling to sacrifice the 70% ratio to accommodate the opinions of Kijūrō Shidehara's diplomacy, then the turnaround will still be hopeless.</p>
<p>As for the biggest difficulty on the European continent, it is the contention between France and Italy. The other day, French representative Aristide Briand declared that the conference was hopeless and that he would leave England immediately. But today, not only has he not left England, but he has also held a meeting with the Italian representative. It is believable that France and Italy are also trying to turn the situation around. However, the French representative is unwilling to publish the results of the meeting, and the Italian representative vaguely revealed that there has been no progress. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether the dispute between France and Italy can be resolved.</p>
<p>US President Herbert Hoover issued a statement today, saying that he firmly believes that the London conference is already trying to proceed, which also expresses the hope of jointly turning the situation around. Because if this conference were to break down completely, it would have a great impact on the future of the world, and the crisis that it would entail would be impossible to fathom. Therefore, when the conference is on the verge of collapse, the key figures of various countries must be able to think about this and thus, this opportunity to jointly turn the situation around arises. This can be said to be a preliminary realization. However, whether this opportunity to jointly turn the situation around can ultimately succeed depends on the degree of realization of each country. It is not too late to rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff and not hesitate. The future may be promising.</p>

<p>Franco-Italian Meeting Inconclusive</p>
<p>New Developments in US-Japan Negotiations</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - French Foreign Minister Briand and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi met alone for an hour today, which has attracted much attention, as the most important issue at present is the deadlock between France and Italy. After the meeting, Grandi declined to answer questions from reporters, while Briand admitted that no progress had been made.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - The Times reports that the American and Japanese representatives at the naval conference have reached a satisfactory understanding. There is now reason to believe that the tonnage limit for Japan's 8-inch gun cruisers can be set at 108,400 tons, while the US limit for 8-inch gun cruisers will be 180,000 tons. However, the Japanese Navy can obtain a greater comparative strength in submarines and destroyers, approximately 70% to 80% of what the US requires. In terms of 8-inch gun cruisers, the US can have 18 (i.e., 180,000 tons), the UK can have 15 (i.e., 150,000 tons), and Japan 12 (i.e., 108,400 tons). A reply telegram from Tokyo is expected in a week, and it is hoped that the Japanese government will agree.</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 14th - Japan's demand for auxiliary vessels to be 70% of the US's level is the focus of US-Japan negotiations. The US has proposed a new plan, the content of which is as follows: (1) For 10,000-ton cruisers with 8-inch guns, the US has consistently insisted on maintaining 180,000 tons, i.e., 18 ships, intending Japan to take 60%. (2) Regarding the overall 70% for auxiliary vessels, the US has made slight concessions, approaching the 70% level. (3) Regarding the demand to retain the existing strength of 78,000 tons for submarines, the US proposes a limit of 60,000 tons, because it recognizes a comparatively larger ratio for light cruisers and destroyers, in order to approach the overall 70%. For large 8-inch gun cruisers, the US adheres to its initial opinion of 60%. While making some concessions on the number of submarines, it is still far from the main points advocated by Japan. Although Japan is dissatisfied, the gap has narrowed considerably and cannot be rejected. The current situation is to observe the overall shape of the conference and then seek a solution. However, the US has repeatedly urged Japan to decide its attitude. Minister plenipotentiary Mr. Hugh Gibson has visited both plenipotentiaries Wakatsuki and Matsudaira three times on the 13th and 14th. Japan must consider carefully and has not yet expressed its intentions, and is currently requesting instructions from the government. In short, the conference is gradually showing signs of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th - In the stalled London Conference, it seems that the US and Japan have found a point of compromise. Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki has telegraphed the content to the government for instructions. As a result, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara will discuss and send back instructions in a telegram within today or tomorrow. At the same time, the Ministry of the Navy also convened an emergency important meeting, with all the leaders, including Chief of Naval General Staff Kato and Vice Minister Yamanashi, attending. The meeting started at 9:00 AM and showed no sign of ending. Vice Minister Yamanashi, when leaving to attend the Military Police Conference midway, told people that the US-Japan negotiations could be decided within one or two weeks. Although Japan hopes for the success of the conference, it will never concede on its minimum demands, which should be clearly noted. It seems that the US-Japan negotiations have progressed to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - Major newspapers have issued special editions, saying that according to news from London, the US and Japan have reached a preliminary agreement, allowing Japan to have 70% of the tonnage the US requires on auxiliary vessels. Official circles have not yet received confirmation of this news, but the atmosphere is more optimistic regarding the outcome of the negotiations, which is already evident.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th - The Japanese authorities have adopted a policy of secrecy regarding the attitude towards the disarmament conference. However, a part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs leaked the theory of softening the 70% demand, which has become the center of discussion. Today, all newspapers in Tokyo carried this matter and commented on it in editorials. Hochi Shimbun carried that regarding Japan's fundamental policy, the opinions of the Navy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs differ. The Navy authorities strongly advocate the 70% demand as absolute. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the spirit of disarmament lies in establishing world peace and reducing the burden on the people, so some concessions are inevitable within this scope. Chugai Shogyo Shinpo carried that hoping for the establishment of a disarmament agreement, they do not hesitate to make the greatest sacrifices. Facing the difficult hurdle of 70% with the US, the Japanese government has shown 100% sincerity for the sake of international peace. The Japanese government has not officially announced the 70% claim to the US. The highest figure on the surface is normal for any country. A part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has slightly revealed this intention. Tokyo Asahi Shimbun carried that the unresolved issue is the problem of large cruisers. The US has already made considerable concessions. For the success of the conference, Japan may also make some concessions. This is also a compromise theory within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kokumin Shimbun carried that regarding disarmament, there are different opinions within the government. The Foreign Ministry supports the theory of softening the demand, while the Navy authorities insist on adhering to the principle. Will there be a breakdown or a compromise? The crossroads of whether disarmament will succeed depends on Japan's response to the final concession to the United States, but the time for Japan to express its attitude is imminent. The following are excerpts from the editorials of each newspaper: Chugai Shogyo Shinpo said, if the attitude of Britain and the United States is high-handed, the disarmament conference will ultimately fail. Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun said, the London Conference has become a stalemate. The last ray of hope must not be extinguished. Is the official optimism in London a sign of reflection by Britain and the United States? We sincerely hope so.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th - There are rumors within the Japanese government that it will concede on its demand for 70% of the US's level. The Navy leadership immediately held an important meeting today to discuss this matter. Afterwards, Vice Minister Yamanashi was sent to see Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara to inquire whether the news was true. The Foreign Minister completely denied this. Vice Minister Yamanashi also understood and took his leave.</p>

<p>French Proposal Accepted</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 14th - The Tariff Truce Conference is now trending towards a compromise solution, as British Board of Trade President Graham has decided to accept the French proposal to continue the existing trade agreements for one year, with the addition of a clause prohibiting tariff increases during this period unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary to add tariffs, an opportunity for negotiation must be given before the new tariffs are implemented.

<p>Associated Press, Washington, 14th - Since the New Progressive Party occupied the main force in the US Senate, the long-pending New Tariff Bill may be indefinitely delayed again. Although there was hope that this bill would be passed immediately a few days ago, the situation has greatly changed today. Even those familiar with the situation in the Senate dare not make any assertions, determining when it can be passed. After the failure of the Democratic Party and the Republican factions in the western agricultural regions, the entire bill may be greatly revised as a result. The result of the revision may be to increase all tariff rates.</p>
<h3 id="e46">English Channel Tunnel Construction Plan <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - The report of the English Channel Tunnel Investigation Committee has now been published, advocating the construction of a test pilot tunnel at a cost of £5.6 million. If the test is successful, a pedestrian tunnel will be built at an estimated cost of £25 million. It also proposes that this project should be undertaken by private individuals and financially supported by the government. The committee expressed its opinion that the construction, maintenance, and operation of such a tunnel would be economical, and that opening a new route would increase trade, which would be economically beneficial to the UK. The cost of this project should be recovered from passenger and freight charges that are no more expensive than current Channel crossing ferry fares. This project can employ 1,000 British workers for five years and 6,000 workers for three years, so it can provide relief for unemployment. The estimated annual maintenance cost is no more than £500,000. However, Lord Ebisham, a member of the committee, dissented, opposing this plan based on economic reasons.</p>

<p>Larger than Earth and Smaller than Uranus</p>
<p>Attracts the Attention of Astronomers Worldwide</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - The Lowell Observatory in Arizona, USA, has discovered a new planet beyond Neptune, larger than Earth and smaller than Uranus. After Professor Shapley announced this on Thursday, renowned British astronomers paid close attention to it, considering it the most important astronomical event in the last hundred years. Another telegram from the US estimates the diameter of this new planet to be 19,000 miles, its position being between Earth and Uranus. The Royal Astronomical Society of Britain said that for many years, many astronomers have assumed that there is a planet beyond Neptune. This star is extremely difficult to see and cannot be seen with the naked eye. Currently, this star is in the direction of the Milky Way. According to the president of the association, Crommelin, this discovery may affect Halley's Comet, changing the period of each return of the comet by two days.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Opening of the National Training Conference <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The National Training Conference held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 15th in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. Present were Central Committee members, representatives from party headquarters in various provinces and special municipalities, general branches overseas, special party headquarters of various armies and railway bureaus, officials from various central departments and councils, and representatives from various courts and ministries, totaling approximately six to seven hundred people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided. After the ceremony, Vice Minister of Training He Yingqin reported (Minister Dai Chuanxian was receiving medical treatment in Shanghai due to illness), stating that the Party bears the mission of leading the masses in various tasks, and training is particularly important. In the past, there were inevitable errors in the training of the masses, which caused mass organizations to deviate from the right track. Therefore, based on the plan decided by the Third National Congress, this conference was convened to study good guidelines and seek to improve facilities during this period of political tutelage, to improve the livelihood and education of the masses, to strengthen the belief in the Three Principles of the People, and all factual needs, to plan in detail and serve as a guide. Therefore, the conference has great significance: (1) to understand the work status of party headquarters at all levels; (2) to remedy the shortcomings of past work and seek comprehensive and sound training, so that the Party and the masses have a spirit of unity, and are not scattered. For example, spiritual education should enable young men and women to have correct beliefs, so as to cultivate the moral abilities necessary for the people during the period of political tutelage, or vigorously carry out cooperation and thrift movements to improve the social economy, so as to consolidate the foundation of the Three Principles of the People. These are all the most important plans at present. It is hoped that based on the plan of the Third Plenary Session and referring to the experience of more than a year, the conference will gather together and achieve good results, so that all levels of party headquarters and the masses can communicate and unite, respond in a chain, and all soldiers in the armies can understand the spirit of the Party, promote hard work, and focus on their work. I am deeply honored. Then, Chiang Kai-shek, representing the Central Committee, gave an instruction, stating that the Party's strength has already spread throughout the country, but reactionary forces still continue to arise. Party members in various places cannot use their work efficiency to promote the elimination of the reactionaries. This must be attributed to the shortcomings in training, which must be examined and remedied. Before the Qing Dynasty, when the Party could not be public, there was not much training, but the party members received a few instructions from the Premier, or a few articles, and they were able to imprint them in their minds and fight to the death. Later, the party affairs were made public, the scope became larger, and there were more party members, and training became more difficult. Generally, young people have many misunderstandings about revolutionary theory, and the Communist Party and all the reactionaries are also mixed in, confusing the public, causing the people to not know what to do. Now, it is urgent to concentrate talents and carefully study how to make the people's faith firm and not be incited by the reactionaries, so that the foundation of the Party will not be shaken. The most important points in training work: (1) It is necessary to follow a certain step, starting on a small scale and gradually seeking to expand it. If the party headquarters in each province train 200 cadre party members each year for each county and district party headquarters to be responsible for training the masses in each county, the effect will definitely be great. (2) The orders and slogans of the Central Party Headquarters must be implemented in the coal departments at all levels and the general public, so that they can be jointly observed. If the party headquarters is equal to the yamen, the committee member is equal to the official, and the party member is equal to the gentry, it will flow into corruption, and the future of the Party will be unimaginable. (3) Training should be based on party education as a principle, so that the military and civilians are all affected. Therefore, training in schools and troops should be more emphasized than ordinary training. If the party and the military and the people can be consistent in spirit, then even if there are a small number of reactionaries who are making trouble, it will not be difficult to make them eliminate themselves, etc. Then, Education Minister Chiang Meng-lin finished his speech, the ceremony was completed, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Reports Recent Diplomacy <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon (the 14th), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Bao Jing'an to the Central Broadcasting Radio Station to report on recent diplomacy. The report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"There are several diplomatic matters this week that are worth reporting. First, let's talk about the Sino-Russian issue. Since the Boli Preliminary Conference decided to mutually release prisoners of war and overseas Chinese, China released all the Russian overseas Chinese who were previously detained in the Songbei Detention Center in Harbin. However, the Soviet Union has not yet fully fulfilled its obligations. According to a recent report from the German Embassy, there are still 45 overseas Chinese detained in Vladivostok who refuse to be released. At the same time, the German Foreign Ministry also received the same report, and stated that the overseas Chinese who have been released have also been subjected to abuse, their assets have not been returned, and they have been subjected to various difficulties in issuing exit passports, causing our overseas Chinese to suffer all kinds of hardships. The German Foreign Ministry has telegraphed the German Ambassador to Russia to actively negotiate, etc. It is most regrettable that Russia disregards international credibility. The German Embassy now believes that the German consul in Vladivostok is too busy to represent China's interests for a long time, and hopes that we will send personnel to Vladivostok as soon as possible to handle matters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Xu Xiong, the Consul General stationed in Vladivostok, to return to his post immediately. As for the date of the formal Sino-Russian conference, it will have to wait until our plenipotentiary representative, Mo Dehui, arrives in Harbin and contacts the Russian side before it can be decided.</p>
<p>The second matter is the dissolution of the Kuomintang branch in Singapore by the new Governor-General of Singapore, Clementi. This matter has already aroused the attention of the national people, and questions have also been raised in the British Parliament about this matter, which shows the seriousness of the matter. On February 20, the Governor of Singapore, Clementi, invited the second executive and supervisory committee members of the Singapore General Branch to the Governor's Office for a discussion. He believed that the existence of the Kuomintang branch hindered British sovereignty and gave a deadline of one month to abolish all party branches in Singapore. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed the Minister to the United Kingdom, Shi Zhaoji, and the Consul General to Singapore, Tang Liu, to file a serious protest separately. The British Foreign Ministry has now telegraphed Clementi for inquiries, and believes that it is inappropriate for the Governor to handle this matter without first reporting it. This matter can be expected to be resolved soon. Regarding the suppression of party members in the Dutch East Indies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the Consul General in Java to actively negotiate.</p>
<p>The third is the negotiation to abolish the forced labor of Chinese laborers in Dutch Sumatra. According to the laws of the Dutch East Indies, there are regulations on compulsory labor for Easterners. There were such regulations in various places in the past. Recently, the islands of Java have been cancelled, but the various places in Sumatra have not yet been cancelled. In the Eastern region, there is a so-called compulsory fire fighting system. All overseas Chinese are designated by the local authorities to go to the scene to fight the fire if there is a fire in the area. If they do not go, they will be fined no more than 25 guilders, or detained for no more than 25 days. In the Raha area, overseas Chinese should pay 15 guilders per year for road repair tax and night watch tax, otherwise they will be subjected to forced labor. Now the road repair tax, etc., has been cancelled through the active negotiations of our country's consuls. As for the compulsory fire fighting system in the east, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Consul Tang of Jukang to actively negotiate, and it can be hoped that it will be cancelled soon.</p>
<p>The fourth is the issue of treaty revision. The Treaty of Friendship between China and Cuba is now being actively negotiated by Ling Bing, the Minister to Cuba, with the Cuban government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has presented a request to the National Government to appoint Minister Ling as the plenipotentiary representative for signing the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce. The Greek government has already ratified the Sino-Greek Treaty. Wang Zhengting, the Foreign Minister, and Song Ziwen, the Finance Minister, and Shigemi Mitsuru, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, have agreed on a draft of the Sino-Japanese Customs Agreement at the diplomatic residence in Sakae-Wan. After consulting the governments of the two countries, it can be formally signed. The content of the agreement reported in the newspapers is not accurate. Regarding the issue of recovering the leased territory of Weihaiwei, the British Minister Lampson has sent the draft agreement to London for instructions. The instructions from the British government have not yet been received. After the instructions arrive, the agreement can be formally signed. Regarding the Sino-US Arbitration Treaty, the term has now expired. The Minister to the United States, Wu Chaoshu, is negotiating with the United States to renew it. A few days ago, Minister Wu sent the draft renewal treaty to the Ministry for review. The Ministry believed that there were still inappropriate places in the articles, and telegraphed the Minister to negotiate amendments with the US government. Now, Minister Wu has telegraphed that the US government has agreed to amend the points. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Minister Wu, ordering him to proceed with the signing procedures. Fifth, two Sino-US pending cases have been resolved. These two cases occurred entirely in 1923. One was that in May 1923, American soldiers shot and killed a coolie, Zhang Lin, in Ji County, Hebei Province. After repeated negotiations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the offending soldiers were sentenced to life imprisonment by the American military court, and the victim's family was compensated with US$1,000. The other case was that in February 1923, American soldiers were target shooting in Hankou, and a stray bullet accidentally killed a child, Tang Huan. The victim's family has now been compensated with US$100. These two sums have been handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the American Minister Johnson for forwarding to the victim's family. These two cases seem to have been delayed for too long on the surface. In fact, the American government pays great attention to the budget. No matter how much extra expenditure, it must be approved by Congress before it can be allocated. Because there are too many procedures for turnover, it has been delayed until recently before it was concluded.</p>
<p>Sixth, regarding the issue of protecting foreign nationals in China, several very unfortunate things have happened recently. One is that three Finnish missionaries were kidnapped by bandits in Guangdong. One is that Dutch missionaries were robbed in Anhui. One is that the French consul in Longzhou, Guangxi, was taken away by the Communist bandits. In addition to telegraphing the responsible authorities in each province to do their best to rescue them, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also transferred the matter to the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that all armies and divisions in the country must pay attention to the safety of the lives and property of foreigners in the future and provide extra protection. The Ministry of Military Affairs has now transferred the matter to the garrisons in each province to comply with the instructions.</p>
<p>Seventh, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Judicial Administration are now negotiating the recovery of the Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court. Regarding this issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already notified the French Minister, and the method of recovery can be formally discussed soon. In addition, China's activities in the international arena are also worth reporting. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a notification from the Secretariat of the League of Nations, stating that the International Arbitration Security Committee has scheduled a meeting in Geneva on the 24th of this month, and has invited China to send a representative to attend. Our country's representative has not yet been appointed. The 14th International Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva on June 10th, and China will also send a representative to participate. The French Embassy reported that the First International Microbiology Congress is scheduled to be held in Paris on July 20th this year. The Secretary-General of the Congress has formally sent a letter to our country, inviting us to send an official representative to attend at that time. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a letter to the Ministry of Health for review. Livide, the head of the French Aviation Propaganda Committee, formally notified Gao Lu, our Minister to France, that the Committee has scheduled to convene the First International Aviation Safety Congress in Paris on December 12th this year to discuss the scientific and practical safety of aviation. All countries in the world will be invited to attend, and our country is invited to sponsor it. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now reviewing the plan with the Ministry of Military Affairs and Communications. The International Statistical Conference is scheduled to be held in Japan in September this year, and we have formally sent a letter inviting our country to send a representative to attend. At that time, our country will send personnel from the competent statistical authority to participate. The Czechoslovak representative notified our country, inviting us to send a representative to attend the First International Criminal Punishment Conference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now asked the Judicial Yuan to review it."</p>
<h3 id="e55">Gu Zhutong Leads Troops to Arrive in Ji'nan <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Jinan, 12th: According to reports from Jinan, the Central Army's Second Division has now deployed six regiments to Jinan, with the remainder still en route. The division's supply stations and rear hospitals have also arrived. Gu Zhutong, the Sixteenth Route Army Commander-in-Chief, arrived in Jinan by special train from Xuzhou at 12:05 PM today (the 12th), along with the heads of the eight departments of the General Headquarters. When the special train entered the station, military police were on high alert in the vicinity. Chen Tiaoyuan dispatched Ruan Zhaochang, commander of the Fifty-fifth Division, and Zhao Jingshi, the mayor of Jinan, to welcome him at the station. Before Gu's arrival, the Sixteenth Route Army General Headquarters had already been set up in the Jinan commercial district's Chamber of Commerce. After disembarking, Gu went directly to his headquarters to rest, and then to the General Headquarters of the Punitive Expeditionary Army's General Reserve Force to meet with Chen Tiaoyuan for a long discussion. It is said that after Gu's troops arrive in Shandong, they will be stationed between Jinan and Tai'an. Currently, the Fourth Brigade and Sixth Brigade have arrived in Jinan. The headquarters of the Fourth Brigade is located at the Gongshun Inn on Dama Road, and the headquarters of the Sixth Brigade is located in Xinzhuang. The Seventh Regiment of the Fourth Brigade is stationed in Duandian, the Eighth Regiment in Zhangzhuang, and the Ninth Regiment in Shierliqiao.

The Fourth Brigade's medical team is stationed at the western end of Duandian, and the Sixth Brigade's field hospital is located at the Dechang Factory on Weiliu Road in the commercial district. It is reported that the headquarters of the Fourth Branch of the General Supply Station is located at Tianqiao. It is said that a comprehensive deployment will be made after all of Gu's troops arrive.</p>
<p>Another report from the Central News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Although Yan Xishan has announced his resignation, Fu Zuoyi's troops in the Cangzhou and Lianzhen areas have not yet withdrawn. To strengthen the defense of Shandong, the Central Government has specially dispatched Gu Zhutong's Second Division to assist the Shandong Army. As of today (the 10th), five trains of Gu's troops have arrived. The first train carried Wang Jingjiu, commander of the Ninth Regiment of the Fourth Brigade of the Second Division. The entire regiment arrived in Jinan at 6:45 AM on the 9th, disembarked immediately, and marched to Luokou, then to Shierliqiao on the south bank of the Yellow River. The second train arrived in Jinan at 7:30 AM, carrying the entire Seventh Regiment of the Fourth Brigade of the Second Division, led by Commander Hou Kesheng.

After disembarking, they marched to Wangguanzhuang on the south bank of the Yellow River in Luokou to garrison. The remaining units of Gu's division are continuously departing. Gu Zhutong himself will also arrive in Jinan soon. It is said that after Gu was appointed by the Central Government as the Commander-in-Chief of the Sixteenth Route Army, the Second Division of Gu, the Fifty-second Division of Ye Kaixin, and the Provisional Third Division of Liu Zhendian were placed under the command of the Sixteenth Route Army. Currently, more than three regiments of Gu's troops have arrived in Jinan, and the remaining troops and Ye Kaixin's division are in Xuzhou, preparing to depart. After receiving orders, Liu Zhendian, in addition to leaving a portion to defend Yantai, will concentrate the remaining troops in Huimin and Putai to await further instructions. The Sixteenth Route Army General Headquarters will be located in the former Foreign Affairs Office on Xiaowei Erlu in Jinan. The army will be responsible for the defense between Jinan and Tai'an. Ruan Zhaochang, the commander of the Fifty-fifth Division, recently returned to Jinan to consult with Chen Tiaoyuan, the chairman of the provincial government. He stated that the division currently has only Yue Shengxuan's 163rd Brigade stationed in Yanzhou and Wenshang, while the remaining brigades, such as Li Songshan's 164th Brigade, are stationed in Pingyuan and Yucheng, and Zhang Bin's 165th Brigade is stationed in Jinan. Therefore, the division headquarters must be moved to Jinan for convenient command. This was submitted to the Central Government for approval. Today, Xu Weimin, the chief of staff of the division, has returned to Jinan from Yanzhou with all the staff of the division headquarters. The division headquarters will be temporarily located in Jinan, and its future destination has not yet been determined. The defense of the Yanzhou and Lincheng areas has been filled by Chen Xiaosi's Second Security Brigade.</p>

<p>Announces the Qingdao Municipal Plan</p>
<p>Ge Jing'en, the mayor of Qingdao, hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 4:30 PM on the 11th, with over forty people in attendance. Ge announced the Qingdao municipal operation plan, saying, "I should have visited everyone upon my arrival in Qingdao, but due to the busy schedule, I have invited you all here for a talk. Please forgive any shortcomings. Since I arrived in Qingdao, several reporters have asked about the Qingdao governance policy. I was unable to respond at the time, and I have no personal policy. All municipal facilities will be handled in accordance with the municipal policy set by the Central Government. However, there are several aspects of the current municipality that need to be carried out and improved. I would like to take this opportunity to talk to you about them. First, Qingdao's finances are currently in deficit. This phenomenon must be remedied. It has now been decided to cut redundant agencies and overstaffed personnel to ensure that expenditures are within the limits of income, so as not to waste public funds. The second is construction. Qingdao was just a barren peninsula thirty years ago, and it was only through the efforts of foreigners that it developed to its current state. Since our country took over, it has gradually declined, which is very bad. In the future, we will actively engage in construction, such as expanding waterworks and building more docks. At present, the Central Government is in extreme financial difficulty. If we want to take money from the Central Government to expand Qingdao's construction, it is impossible. I will only use Qingdao's income in Qingdao and not divert it to other uses. The third is culture and sports. Although Qingdao's material construction and industry and commerce are developed, and the population has increased to more than 300,000, culture and sports are very backward and undeveloped. As far as schools are concerned, there are too few. In the future, we will pay special attention to promoting culture and sports to promote their advancement. The fourth is labor and labor unrest. Before I came, I knew that Qingdao's labor unrest was very turbulent last year. After arriving in Qingdao, I have been talking to the Municipal Party Department about labor issues for days, and four methods have been agreed upon: (1) If workers have demands on the capitalists, the Municipal Government and the Party Department will negotiate with the factory on their behalf, except for minor matters. (2) The occurrence of strikes in factories is very bad. The Municipal Government and the Party Department will jointly inform all workers that they must not strike in the future and must work hard. (3) The government will provide appropriate placement for unemployed workers who are good. (4) Bad workers will be punished according to the law. Finally, I would like to ask you to give your advice from time to time. If there is anything wrong, please feel free to criticize and correct it." At this point, it was already after 6:00 PM, so tea and refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Overview of Qingdao's Construction <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao's construction industry is based on the legacy of the German and Japanese operations. It should have considerable achievements. However, from the time of takeover to the present, not only has there been no progress, but even maintaining the status quo has been declining due to financial constraints. The following is a report on the construction of Qingdao's waterworks, forestry, and road engineering in recent years, based on investigations:</p>
<p>(1) Waterworks: After the Germans leased Qingdao in 1898, they began to operate the waterworks. The Japanese continued to develop water sources and install water pipes when they took over Qingdao. By the time China took over, there were three water sources: (1) Licun water source, which can produce more than 6,000 tons of water per day; (2) Baisha River water source, which can produce more than 6,000 tons of water per day; and (3) Haibo River water source, which can produce 900 tons of water per day. The water pipes are installed throughout the city, and water can flow to Cangku and Sifang, making it very convenient for citizens to use water. In recent years, the population has increased, and the Municipal Government has opened a new water source downstream of the Baisha River, which is currently installing machinery. It is expected that it can produce 3,000 tons of water per day, so there will be no water shortage even during the spring drought. However, the waterworks machinery installed by the Germans has been in use for more than 30 years. The lifespan of the water pipes is only 13 years, and the lifespan of the machinery at the water source is only 4 years. Now, for the sake of preparedness, we should try to reserve funds for the replacement of new pipes and machinery. In 1927, it was proposed to save 251,100 yuan per year for the replacement of new pipes, but it failed to materialize due to insufficient funds. It is reported that the replacement of German-made machinery and water pipes requires a total of 1.4 million yuan, and the replacement of Japanese-made machinery and water pipes requires 1.85 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Forestry: Qingdao, with its barren mountains, was transformed into lush greenery through the German's full-scale afforestation efforts, making it famous for its beautiful scenery. The Germans invested 152 million German marks in Qingdao's forestry, with 37,300 acres of official forest, 350 acres of farmland, 16 parks, and 5,900 acres of private forest. The arrangement and planting of forests can truly be a model for the whole country. During the Japanese occupation, more than 300,000 Japanese yen were allocated annually to continue the expansion, which was still progressive. Since our country took over, it has only been able to maintain the status quo due to financial constraints, and the annual expenditure on agriculture and forestry is only more than 59,000 yuan. Therefore, although the Agricultural and Forestry Office has repeatedly had expansion plans, it has failed to materialize. It is reported that the office plans to afforest 150 acres in Laoshan this year and will add 30 acres on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death to promote afforestation.</p>
<p>(3) Road Engineering: Qingdao's road engineering is very advanced, and the roads in the city are especially neat and clean. Currently, there are approximately more than 300 li of roads in the city, totaling 1.8 million square meters, of which 330,000 square meters are asphalt roads. The roads outside the city leading to Laoshan, Licun, Shazikou, Cangku and other places are also more than 300 Chinese li, totaling 870,000 square meters. Since the takeover, 140,000 square meters of new asphalt roads and more than 10,000 square meters of gravel roads have been built. The annual maintenance cost of road engineering is about 120,000 yuan. Qingdao's construction industry is relatively successful in this area, and the addition of roads in remote areas is also being planned.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Survey of Women's Occupations in Jinan <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the success of the revolution and the emancipation of women, the number of women with jobs has gradually increased, even in Jinan. Many women are working in Party affairs, and women are also gradually appearing in administrative offices. Among them, the increase in the education sector is particularly obvious. Due to various reasons, the status of women's occupations in industry, commerce, and other classes has not progressed. The following is a record of the number of women in various fields and the comparison with the number of men, based on the survey:</p>
<p>Administrative Agencies: Provincial Government: 131 men, 8 women; Department of Civil Affairs: 94 men, 0 women; Department of Finance: 115 men, 0 women; Department of Construction: 70 men, 0 women; Department of Education: 35 men, 1 woman; Department of Agriculture and Mining: 40 men, 0 women; Department of Industry and Commerce: 41 men, 0 women; Municipal Government: 43 men, 2 women; Municipal Finance Bureau: 41 men, 0 women; Municipal Social Affairs Bureau: 37 men, 0 women; Municipal Public Works Bureau: 40 men, 0 women; Municipal Public Security Bureau: 88 men, 0 women; River Affairs Bureau: 53 men, 0 women;</p>
<p>Party Affairs Agencies: Provincial Party Department: 60 men, 7 women; Provincial Women's Association: 11 women; Municipal Party Department: 25 men, 0 women; County Party Department: 23 men, 1 woman; County Women's Association: 4 women;</p>
<p>Education: Senior High School: 36 men, 5 women; First Middle School: 36 men, 1 woman; Girls' Middle School: 11 men, 4 women; First Vocational School: 26 men, 0 women; Girls' Vocational School: 15 men, 3 women; First Normal School: 46 men, 0 women; Girls' Normal School: 15 men, 12 women; Mass Education Center: 37 men, 9 women; First Experimental Elementary School: 15 men, 10 women; Second Experimental Elementary School: 22 men, 6 women; Third Experimental Elementary School: 9 men, 22 women; Fourth Experimental Elementary School: 13 men, 8 women; Fifth Experimental Elementary School: 10 men, 7 women; (The above is based on the statistics of staff and teachers in various schools in the second half of the 18th year of the Department of Education.) Girls' Normal School Affiliated Elementary School: 8 men, 13 women; First Normal School Affiliated Elementary School 1: 11 men, 11 women; First Normal School Affiliated Elementary School 2: 6 men, 4 women; Beiyuan Normal School: 9 men, 0 women; Rural First Normal School: 14 men, 0 women; Rural Normal School Center Elementary School: 5 men, 1 woman; Zhengyi Middle School: 30 men, 1 woman; Zhengyi Affiliated Elementary School 1: 7 men, 2 women; Zhengyi Affiliated Elementary School 2: 4 men, 1 woman;</p>
<p>Business: There are the fewest women in the Jinan business community. Those completely operated by women include the Girls' Commercial Firm on Xiaowei Liu Road and the Girls' Photography Studio, but they are very small in scale. There are also not many female employees in other stores, only in a few places such as the Yinguang Theater.</p>
<p>Industry: Larger factories in Jinan that are easy to investigate include: Lufeng Yarn Factory, with more than 1,200 female workers; Zhengye Match Factory, with more than 200 female workers; Dongyulong Tobacco Factory, with 50 female workers; Tailong Foreign Firm Hairnet Factory, with 600 female workers. Other small hairnet factories, hat factories, and household women's handicrafts, such as pasting matchboxes, are difficult to count at once, but are estimated to be only more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Hospitals: There are only one or two female doctors in Jinan. There are also not many female nurses in hospitals. The Republican Hospital has about 30 people, the Jinan Hospital has 8 people, and the Wanda Hospital, Dehua Hospital, and Sanmin Hospital each have only one or two people.</p>
<p>According to the population statistics of the Jinan Public Security Bureau, there are more than 250,000 men and more than 150,000 women. The difference between men and women is as many as 100,000 people, and only a few thousand of these 150,000 women are employed. Nine out of ten are buried in the family. This is because the organization of Chinese cities is centered on men. This is something that those who are enthusiastic about the women's movement should pay attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Japanese Postal Service in South Manchuria <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Among the Japanese economic aggressions, the South Manchurian postal service has nearly 200 general bureaus, branch bureaus, and agency offices established in the three northeastern provinces. The airmail service has also achieved considerable results, with annual revenue of more than 6 million. In addition, telegraph and telephone lines and radio waves are like a net that surrounds and covers the southern part of Northeast China. The investigation is as follows:</p>
<p>History and Evolution: The Japanese postal rights in our Northeast have no basis in treaty and have not been recognized by us. They were obtained entirely by plunder. Initially, during the Russo-Japanese War, 94 military post offices were established as military communication agencies. After the war, they took advantage of the situation to expand, and in 1906 (the 22nd year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty), all military post offices were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Kwantung Government-General. From then on, it was completely organized as a postal service, and postal and telegraph offices were established to manage it. After the necessary reorganization, there were 36 post offices and 8 branch offices at that time. Afterwards, they were added year by year. By the 9th year of the Taisho era, there were more than 200 post offices, branch offices, and agency offices. In that year, a major reform of the postal system was carried out, and the Postal and Telegraph Office was renamed the Communications Management Bureau. All telegrams, telephones, radio, and airmail services were placed under its</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>management.</p>
<p>Expansion over the Years: Since the Japanese seized our postal rights out of thin air, they have been actively expanding them several times, making steady progress and sparing no effort. After the Pacific Conference, all countries withdrew their post offices in China, but Japan still stubbornly maintained its postal service in the Northeast and refused to return it, because it had already tasted great benefits and would not give up halfway. The following is a table showing the postal progress over the years:</p>
<p>Increase in the Number of Ordinary Postal Items</p>

<p>Meiji 39 (1906)　22,821,242　13,014,613</p>

<h3 id="e61">Postal Route Mileage <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>

<p>Meiji 40 (1907) | Railways &amp; Waterways | 705 | 2,167</p>
<p>Taisho 1 (1912) | Railways | 691 | 1,067,820 | Waterways | 580 | 72,732</p>

<p>Showa 3 (1928) | Railways | 1,365 | 5,867 | Waterways | 1,875 | 2,899</p>
<p>The volume of mail listed in the table above, except for Showa 1, where regular mail and parcels suddenly decreased, has increased in all other years. The magnitude of this increase is truly astonishing. In contrast, our country's postal service is showing signs of decline everywhere. According to the Shenyang Postal Workers' Union, "In recent years, our country's postal service has not only made no progress, but has also shown a tendency to shrink. For example, the length of postal routes has now been reduced by more than 13,000 li..." This situation, compared to the postal service operated by Japan in our Northeast, is truly concerning.</p>
<p>Current Situation: Since the reform in Taisho 9 (1920), the postal service has developed rapidly, with increasing establishments each year. To date, there are more than 200 Japanese postal institutions in southern Manchuria. The frequency of increases and the current numbers are listed below:</p>
<p>Year | Post Offices | Postal Branch Offices | Postal Agencies | Postal Commissioned Agencies</p>
<p>Meiji 39 (1906) | 36 | 8</p>
<p>Taisho 1 (1912) | 30 | 14 | 10 | 70</p>
<p>Taisho 5 (1916) | 30 | 16 | 10 | 74</p>
<p>Taisho 10 (1921) | 42 | 13 | 6 | 75</p>
<p>Showa 1 (1926) | 40 | 8 | 16 | 146</p>
<p>Showa 2 (1927) | 41 | 8 | 17 | 159</p>
<p>Showa 3 (1928) | 42 | 9 | 18 | 40</p>
<p>The figures listed above are as of the end of Showa 3 (1928). (The 17th year of the Republic of China) There were already 218 post offices, branch offices, commissioned agencies, etc. The number of establishments increased in the past two years are not included in these figures. The post offices are mostly located in larger towns, followed by branch offices and postal agencies. As for the commissioned agencies, they are set up at small stations along the railway lines and in various villages and settlements within the Japanese leased territories. The locations are listed below:</p>
<p>Along the South Manchuria Railway: Lushun, Dalian, Xiaogangzi, Shahekou, Yingshu, Piziwo, Jinzhou, Pulandian, Wafangdian, Xiongyue, Gaiping, Dashiqiao, Haicheng, Qianshan, Anshan, Lishan, Shoushan, Liaoyang, Yantai, Sujiatun, Shenyang, Fushun, Xintaizi, Tieling, Kaiyuan, Changtu, Shuangmiaozi, Sipingjie, Guojiadian, Gongzhuling, Fanjiatun, Changchun, Andong Line: Andong, Dadonggou, Fenghuangcheng, Qiaotou, Caohekou, Lianshanguan, Benxi, Yanji, Longjingcun, Xinmin.</p>
<p>Among the post offices listed above, Andong, Changchun, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Yingkou, Tieling, Dalian, and Sipingjie are eight exchange offices that exchange mail with our country's post offices. Among them, the busiest post offices along the railway line, in addition to Changchun and Shenyang, are Fushun, Anshan, Kaiyuan, Yapingjie, Benxi, and Liaoyang. On average, each receives and sends 110,000 to 140,000 pieces of regular mail daily, and 500 to 1,100 parcels. The amount of postal savings is also considerable. In Showa 3, the total savings of Japanese people in the Northeast amounted to more than 18.9 million yuan. In Showa 4, it is said to have exceeded 20 million yuan, an increase of more than 12 million yuan, which is a huge sum.</p>
<p>Airmail: The Japanese Aviation Law was promulgated in June of Showa 2 (1927). In August of the same year, an imperial ordinance was issued to apply the law to the leased territory of Kwantung. Therefore, the experimental flight of the Japan Aviation Company in September of Taisho 15 (1926) was revived, and there was an air transport plan between Dalian and Japan. In Showa 4 (1929), with government subsidies, the Japan Air Transport Company established flights on the Dalian-Tokyo route, implementing the transportation of mail, goods, and passengers between Dalian, Pyongyang, Keijo (Seoul), Ulsan, Okayama, Osaka, and Tokyo. However, goods such as alcohol, tobacco, textiles, corrosives, and flammable materials were not accepted for transportation. The volume of goods was limited to no more than 2.3 Japanese feet in length, and no more than 1.3 Japanese feet in width and thickness. The frequency of flights and postage rates are listed below:</p>
<p>Tokyo-Dalian Route</p>
<p>Round Trip Weekly | Round Trip Weekly</p>
<p>Tokyo-Osaka: 1-2 times | Osaka-Fukuoka: 6 times</p>
<p>Fukuoka-Keijo: 6 times | Keijo-Dalian: 6 times</p>
<p>Postage Rates | Dalian-Korea | Dalian-Korea-Japan</p>
<p>Sealed Letter (weight limit 4 taels) | 18 sen | 33 sen</p>
<p>Unsealed Letter (weight limit 10 taels) | 17 sen | 33 sen</p>
<p>Postcard | 8.5 sen | 16.5 sen</p>
<p>Parcel (limit 200 taels) | 1 yuan 12 sen</p>
<p>Registered Parcel (same limit) | 1 yuan 12 sen | 2 yuan 45 sen</p>
<p>Note: For express mail sent from Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Keijo, etc., an additional 8 sen postage is required.</p>
<p>Although airmail has been in operation for less than a year, and there are no reliable statistics on its transportation volume, it appears from the surface that the transportation of goods and letters is very active. It is said that newspapers sent from Osaka can reach Harbin in three days, and the same is true for letters. Our country's newspapers from Tianjin and Beijing are lagging behind. The current Liaoning authorities plan to open an air transport service with 20 airplanes. If this can be realized, it will be a somewhat encouraging event.</p>

<p>Rogue Extortion Leads to Discovery of Opium: A man named Jia from Zhaotun Bridge in Qingpu, nearly 50 years old, and a young woman, returned from Shanghai on the 11th of this month. They got off the Beijing-Shanghai train at Anting Station, carried their belongings, and walked home. When they passed the Caotang Village area, they were spotted by local rogues Shao Abing, Agen, and others, who suspected them of abduction. They were intercepted and questioned, and more than ten packs of opium, of considerable value, were found in their luggage. Shao and others threatened them extremely, intending to embezzle the opium. Jia's attempt to bribe them was unsuccessful. Then, a man named Ding intervened and persuaded them to divide the opium equally, and hired a boat for Jia to send him back. Unexpectedly, Shao and others started a fight over the division, which was heard by the local policeman Gu Fushan, who reported it to the Eighth District Office for thorough investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>Impersonating Representatives Exposed on the Spot: In Anting Town, of this county, two men named Zhang Shusheng and Xu Weikang, claiming to be representatives of refugees from Zhangde, Henan, and carrying a passport issued by the Public Security Bureau of that county, requested repatriation from the District Office on the 13th of this month. When District Head Qian asked about the number of people, they replied that there were more than 300 people stationed in the Baihejiang Temple. Qian suspected that most of these representatives were impersonating, and that the Public Security Bureau had issued an order to investigate, detain, and send them. He instructed Zhang and Xu to wait temporarily, and sent Chen Yusheng, the squad leader of the security corps, to investigate, but found no trace of them. It was clear that they were impersonating for fraud. He ordered Chen to bring them back and detain them, and prepared a document to send them for handling. Zhang and Xu, realizing that they had been exposed, prostrated themselves and begged for mercy. Qian then rebuked them and sent them away.</p>

<p>Record of Interrogation After the Capture of Bandits: Yang Chasheng, the head of the second police detachment of Zhuangxing, previously cracked the bandit den at Daijia Bridge and had already transferred the three bandit leaders to the county government. Yesterday afternoon, County Magistrate Hong interrogated them. Chen Shusan (also known as Bái Tóu (White Head)), confessed that he lived in the eleventh ward of Songjiang County. On the 24th night of the lunar new year, his accomplices from Shanghai, Li Tingyang, Li Guijie, Yang Xiaoli, Gu Xingcai, Luo Jincai, and Wu Ati, an unknown man from Shanghai, totaled twelve people. They carried several Mauser pistols and gathered at the Tang residence every night at 9 o'clock. They successively led the gang to rob fourteen families, including Zhang Huan's. Chen Shusan would act as lookout with a carrying pole. Afterwards, the Li surname would distribute the loot. Since he didn't know how to use a gun, he only got twelve thousand copper coins and a quilted blanket. He originally had two blankets, but his eldest son, Agen, had been assassinated last autumn. Dai Xiaocai confessed that he was also an accomplice of Li and others. During this robbery, there were also Chen Ad, Tang Huanxiang, Zhang Meitou and several others. The loot was divided into thirteen shares by the Li surname at Chen Shusan's house. They robbed gold rings, gold hairpins, pearl circles, silver coins, banknotes, woolen cloth, clothes, salted chicken, and cured pork legs, totaling more than two hundred items. The Li surname transported all of them to Shanghai. Another bandit gave a similar confession. County Magistrate Hong considers the Tang and Li gangs to be well-known communists and that they are also related to the arson case in Zhuangxing. Therefore, in addition to ordering their detention for further investigation, he also ordered that they be wanted within a time limit and brought to justice.</p>

<p>The Urgent Need to Eliminate Lake Bandits: The Taihu Lake basin is a crucial area. Since recently, lake bandits have been rampant, with the Longwang Temple in Wujiang being looted. The Shanghai-Changshu passenger ship has been robbed four times in a week. In addition, small passenger ships and villages and towns along the lake in Pingwang (Suzhou), Jiaxing, and other places have been harassed. This not only disrupts public order but also hinders waterway transportation. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram on New Year's Day, ordering General Commander Hu to quickly lead his troops stationed in Suzhou and Wuxi to suppress the bandits immediately according to the original plan. General Commander Hu, upon receiving the telegram, dispatched the 25th Regiment of his troops from their defense area in Suqian to Suzhou the day before yesterday. The heads of the various departments of the regimental headquarters and the artillery battalion arrived in Wuxi yesterday (the 15th). The 30th Regiment of the brigade also arrived in Songjiang at the same time. The 28th Regiment is also scheduled to be stationed in the lakeside area of Wuxi within the next few days. Once the anti-bandit troops from all directions have completed their deployment, they will join forces with the police forces from Suzhou and Zhejiang to suppress the bandits on land and water on a selected date.</p>

<p>Communist Murders Villager in Tianshang Market: Chen Jida, a villager from Chenxiang Shangxiang near Zhang Village in Tianshang Market, makes a living as a farmer. He has a modest household. However, because Chen Jida had always been strongly anti-communist, the communists in the village harbored deep resentment. At around one o'clock in the afternoon the day before yesterday, Chen was shopping on Zhang Village Street when he was unexpectedly ambushed by two communists, You and Cao, who grabbed him and stabbed him four times in the right leg with a sharp knife. Blood flowed freely, and he rolled around in agony. The two bandits, You and Cao, then left. Chen cried out for help, and someone ran to inform his family. Chen's mother, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene, first helped her son home, called a doctor to treat him, and then went to the public security sub-bureau to request a manhunt.</p>
<p>Tragic Murder Case Occurs at Huangbudun: Wu, a resident of house number 10 near Huangbudun, outside the North Gate of this county, was from Zhenjiang, aged 47.

<p>Dispute Among Doctors After Cai's Autopsy: The body of Cai Lianbao, the adopted daughter-in-law of Liu Tonghuai of Shanxiang Lane in the city, was autopsied by Chen, a trial officer of the county government, along with ten Western doctors, including Gu Yuanhao, Zhou Guanwen, Gu Jianshan, Zhou Mansun, Zhou Tianmai, Shao Yufan, Xie Tang, Wu Juncheng, and Gu Zhihe. The next day, Xie Tang sent the autopsy record to the doctors present for signature. Unexpectedly, Gu Yuanhao, a doctor at Jishan Hospital, refused to sign, citing three reasons: (1) He had never heard of using concentrated nitric acid to test gastric fluid. (2) He had doubts about the cut duodenum, fearing that the part cut was actually the small intestine. (3) The brain and spinal cord he had extracted were still being cultured and had not yet been tested. He also claimed that the nine people present did not express any concerns at the time, so he did not raise any objections. If the part cut was indeed the small intestine and not the duodenum, would he not be laughed at if he signed the document? The nine doctors who had signed the document learned of this and held a meeting of the Medical Association at the First District Office on the 13th to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they raised four questions for Gu Yuanhao and sent a letter to Gu requesting a response: (1) According to the doctors present during the autopsy, Zhou Mansheng and Gu Jianshan, the section of the duodenum (approximately three inches) that was cut was approximately three inches from the stomach, close to the jejunum. (Since the duodenum is approximately ten inches long, the section cut should undoubtedly be the duodenum. If the bile duct opening was not retained, it should be clarified. This is the first question to be addressed.) (2) Testing the stomach contents is a research-oriented matter, and it was stated at the time that it would not be used as evidence. Therefore, there is no report in the expert opinion. It is thought that your hospital has considerable experience in testing opium addicts and has accurate methods for detecting opium reactions. This is the second question to be addressed. (3) Before the autopsy, there was a meeting at the county government where it was decided that only the stomach, intestines, liver, lungs, heart, urine, and stomach contents needed to be taken. You were also present and agreed. If you believed that it was necessary to extract the bladder and uterus for testing, why did you not state so at the time? This is the third question to be addressed. (4) The county government summoned the doctors to the autopsy site to gather ideas and benefit from everyone's wisdom. You were also present. If you believed that the procedures were not in accordance with regulations, why did you not provide guidance at the time? Why did you refuse to sign the document afterwards? What exactly was your intention? These are the four questions listed for clarification. As for the county government, it extracted the stomach contents, lungs, liver, heart, intestines, and other vital parts from Lianbao's body, along with urine, sealed them in bottles, and sent them by police on the early morning Suzhou boat to the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court on the morning of the 14th to request a designated hospital to test for toxic substances for further investigation.</p>
<p>Electricity Bill Issue Resolved: The Electric Utility Users Association and the Electric Utility Company had been in dispute over improving treatment and electricity bills for a long time and had not yet resolved the issue. At noon on the 12th, six representatives of the Electric Utility Users Association, along with mediators Xiang Juecheng and Gui Junan, and Electric Utility Company manager Yu Qihan and director Zhou Jiongru, met at the New Hotel to discuss the matter for a long time. The Association insisted on an electricity rate of 26 cents per kilowatt-hour, while the Company insisted on 28 cents. The mediators attempted to mediate at 27 cents, but it was unsuccessful. They then attempted to mediate at 27.5 cents, but the Electric Utility Company insisted on 27.8 cents, and the discussion was suspended. On the afternoon of the 13th, the three parties met again at Yao's residence in Jicui Garden, and finally reached an agreement at 27.6 cents. The Electric Utility Company and the Electric Utility Users Association signed an agreement with eight clauses, each holding a copy, and submitted them to the county for record.</p>

Therefore, yesterday, it urgently urged the members of the branches in various counties to redouble their efforts to solicit the full amount of bonds and deliver them to the treasury as soon as possible, obtain receipts for verification and registration, and then submit them for assessment and evaluation for rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Police Forces of Five Counties: The Department of Civil Affairs stated that the police forces of Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, Taixian, and Jingjiang counties were ineffective in suppressing bandits and had been negligent in their organization, which was insufficient to defend against banditry. Therefore, yesterday, it specially ordered Li Changjiang, the Captain of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Corps, to immediately go to the counties to work with the county magistrates to effectively reorganize the police forces. Li Changjiang was also ordered to report the reorganization status at any time. Furthermore, Director Miao of the Department of Civil Affairs stated that banditry was rampant in various counties of Jiangsu Province recently, and the provincial police force was insufficient to handle the situation. He specially ordered Captain Li to immediately recruit 500 provincial police officers and send them to Zhenjiang for training as soon as possible to defend against and suppress bandits and communists.</p>

The department has persuaded him to stay. Currently, the number of people cared for in the various institutions is gradually increasing, while the price of rice is high. The original funding is insufficient to cover expenses, and educational aspects cannot be implemented as desired. Therefore, he has repeatedly requested to resign.</p>

<p>Bandits in Upper and Lower Shamen Annihilated: Wang Xiaolan, a notorious bandit in Guankeng Village, Nanxiang, Linhai, brutally murdered soldiers of the Township Defense Corps in Nara Creek while publicly reporting on land. He then colluded with over 300 bandits from Xian County and gathered in Shangshamen, Xiashamen, Pingkeng, Guankeng, and other places in this county. Military forces once attempted to suppress them, but were unsuccessful due to the rugged terrain. Upon hearing the news, the Zhejiang Provincial Government dispatched Regiment Commander Zhu of the Fifth Regiment stationed in Jiao (Haimen, a district of Taizhou) to mobilize 700 troops with a large number of guns and cannons to encircle and suppress them.

<h3 id="e82">General Post Office Savings and Remittances Bureau <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Post Office Savings and Remittances Bureau, located at 5 Fuzhou Road, officially opened yesterday. Important figures from various sectors of the Party, government, business, and education in this city attended to offer congratulations. The gifts presented were numerous and splendid, making it a grand occasion. Minister of Communications Wang Boqun delivered a speech, followed by a response from General Manager Liu Shufan and a speech by Director-General Lin Shi of the General Post Office. The official opening was at 9:00 AM. The bureau's facilities are very well-organized, and the organization is also very perfect. It is said that the savings and remittance procedures have been substantially improved to strive for the convenience of customers. Therefore, many customers came to the bureau that day to open savings accounts, and the staff were extremely busy. To commemorate the opening, the bureau prepared wallets to distribute to new depositors. In addition, the General Bureau manages postal remittances throughout the country, so post offices everywhere are its remittance agencies. According to statistics, there are a total of 2,125 post offices nationwide, and its remittance capacity is very strong. This method of establishing a special bureau is modeled after the successful practices of various countries, and the past achievements of various countries are very impressive. Therefore, this is not only fortunate for the new business of the post office but also marks a new era for the entire postal service of our country.</p>
<p>Minister Wang's Address: Our country is vast and rich in resources, excelling globally, but the production industry lags behind other countries, which is due to the lack of domestic capital. The reasons for the lack of capital are threefold: (1) failure to establish national capital, (2) failure to adjust social capital, and (3) failure to concentrate individual capital. If national capital, social capital, and people's capital can be combined, various industries will surely develop. Now, during the period of political tutelage, production and beneficial industries are most important. Last year, the inspection commissioner of this department went to Europe, America, and Japan and saw that the territory and population of each country are far less than ours, but the development of the national economy is progressing rapidly. Even with postal savings and remittances, the principle of division of labor is adopted to establish special bureaus and handle matters with great care. Therefore, it complements the overall postal affairs, and its progress and development are unlimited. Therefore, integrated rules were adopted, repeatedly discussed, and approved by the National Government and the Executive Yuan, which led to the establishment of this bureau. Preparations have been underway for three months, and the opening was finally achieved. We have also received congratulations from people from all walks of life, as well as congratulatory letters and savings and remittance materials from the savings and remittance bureaus of Japan and other countries for reference, which is a great honor. Tracing back to the establishment of the postal service in our country, it has been more than 30 years. Initially, it was under the Customs, and it was not until the end of the Qing Dynasty that it separated from the Customs and became independent, which led to substantial progress. This time, the establishment of a special bureau for savings and remittances also marks a new era for the postal service. In the future, it will cooperate with the postal service and the prospects are limitless. This can be expected. Postal agencies are located everywhere, and handling savings and remittances is easy to popularize. In the future, if promotion is effective, it will arouse the savings mindset of the general public and cultivate their frugality. This can be expected in two ways. Our country's currency system has not yet been unified, and it is extremely difficult to organize finances. The postal force is scattered in various provinces, and the daily handling of currency prices and remittances in the interior of each province is clearer. Therefore, in the future, the bureau should make a great contribution to the government's work on unifying the currency system. This can be expected in three ways. The staff of this bureau are carefully selected bank experts and original postal experienced personnel. In terms of financial investment and business development, there should be more confidence, and it is expected that in the future it will be able to compete with the postal industry in Europe and the United States. This can be expected in four ways. However, it is often easy for our country to become bureaucratic. The business operation of this bureau should use scientific methods to strive for commercialization and socialization. This is what should be paid attention to most. All new businesses are created through hard work. We should have a spirit of perseverance and struggle and practice the principle of "people's livelihood first." This is what Boqun and all those involved should encourage each other to do.</p>
<p>General Manager Liu's Response: Today is the opening day of this bureau, and I am extremely grateful for the minister's personal instruction. I believe that the establishment of the General Post Office Savings and Remittances Bureau is extremely important. In the past, China often relied on foreign capital for every undertaking, which led to the loss of rights, increased burdens, and the national economy was on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the inherent assets of the Chinese people were deposited in foreign banks, which is regrettable. This phenomenon is due to the weakness of the people's patriotism, but also to the lack of solid institutions in our country that can make people trust, so it has come to this. The establishment of the postal service is widespread, and its nature is also extremely permanent. The earth will not be destroyed, and the postal service will surely exist. In terms of business organizations, the postal service is the most solid. If it can be guided by the situation, its progress will be unlimited. The purpose of the establishment of this bureau is roughly three things: (1) to establish a chain relationship between the people and the government. The people entrust their hard-earned assets to national institutions for safekeeping. The well-being of the country is the well-being of the people themselves. Then, all internal strife and external insults will have no place to rise. (2) To break the public's perception of trusting foreign banks. Postal guarantees have been confirmed, and the handling methods should be improved. In the future, the recovery of rights will surely be significant. (3) To gather wealth scattered throughout the country to help the development of domestic industries. All foreign capital is not used, and the benefits are immeasurable. All of this is the common goal of the national postal staff, and they must strive to achieve it in order to live up to the earnest expectations of our country and the minister.</p>
<p>Director-General Lin's Congratulatory Speech: Just now, I listened to the minister's instructions and General Manager Liu's response, which were very detailed about the purpose of establishing the General Post Office Savings and Remittances Bureau and the preparations. I have two impressions here: (1) The postal bureaus are located throughout the country, and now the special bureau handles savings and remittance affairs, which can concentrate national capital, generate productive enterprises, and adjust people's livelihood. It is an important construction to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of people's livelihood. (2) It can promote the people's interest in savings and the virtue of frugality, so as to conform to the spirit of the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. When the country has established a trustworthy institution, the people will dare to save with confidence. In the past, when I was in the Northwest, I personally saw the people bury silver underground, hide it in cabinets, or even spend it all. This was all because there was no reliable savings institution, which led to this. The purpose of establishing the postal savings and remittance industry is to cooperate through division of labor. Therefore, postal colleagues and savings and remittance bureau colleagues should work together. We are all one family and there is no boundary. We can take the path of cooperation and make solid progress, then the development of our entire postal service will be limitless. The situation of postal services in various countries is a clear proof. Today is the opening day of the General Post Office Savings and Remittances Bureau. I hope that the colleagues of the two bureaus can do it in this spirit in order to live up to the expectations of the government and the minister. I wish you all the best.</p>

<p>Three Commissioners Including Lin Zhiyuan Not Yet Escorted to the Province</p>
<p>Yang Went to Nanjing Last Night with Chen Shaokuan</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang, Minister of the Navy and Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai aboard the Pu'an warship from Mawei, accompanied by Secretary-General Shen Jinmian, Secretary Wu Shan, Adjutant-General Jiang Zhizhuang, and Secretary Lin Xi. The ship arrived at the Wusongkou at midnight yesterday morning. The Navy Disbandment Office, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched Adjutant Wang Jun, Commander Jiang Luzhuang, and Staff Officer Feng Tao to Wusong to welcome them. After landing, Yang and his party took a car to his private residence on Avenue Joffre to rest.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Visited: At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Zhang Qun of the Special Municipality visited Yang's residence. They discussed the Fujian Bureau dispute in detail for a long time. Later, Acting Minister Chen Shaokuan, Practice Fleet Commander Chen Xunyong, and Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Ren Guangyu and others visited him one after another.</p>
<p>Yang Not Feeling Well: Yang was feeling unwell due to the fatigue of the journey. He took medicine for treatment while on the Pu'an warship. Yesterday afternoon, this newspaper's reporter went to visit him. Yang sent Adjutant-General Jiang Zhizhuang to meet the reporter. According to Jiang, the detained provincial commissioners Cheng Shixuan, Xu Xianshi, and Wu Shu have been sent from Yanping to the province and are being temporarily detained in the arsenal. Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Naiyuan, and Zheng Baoqing are still in Youxi. By the time Chairman Yang left Fujian, they had not yet been escorted to the province, and no telegrams had been received recently.

<h3 id="e84">Japanese Decide on Countermeasures to Reclaim Navigation Rights <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Secretly Increase Ships</p>
<p>Preparing for the Future</p>
<p>Reclaiming navigation rights and opposing mutual Sino-Japanese navigation are the greatest desires of Shanghai's Chinese shipping merchants. After issuing declarations and electing representatives, they presented requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that it would never allow foreign ships to obtain coastal and inland navigation rights, and the Ministry of Communications sent the Navigation Affairs Department to Shanghai to discuss with Shanghai's Chinese ships the preparatory plan for reclaiming navigation rights, such as increasing routes, building more ships, and organizing new shipping companies. This is to avoid the lack of shifts and the disruption of transportation when foreign ships are withdrawn, which will hinder transportation and commercial transport. The Navigation Affairs Department has discussed this matter with Shanghai shipping merchants several times. As the military situation has not been settled, most of the Chinese ships have been suspended, so this case has also been stalled and has not been carried out. Now, the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty is being discussed, and the Japanese side has also taken some action on the reclamation of navigation rights. To the best of our knowledge, they are recorded as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h3 id="e85">Japanese Ships Urgently Seek to Add More Shifts: Sino-Japanese Renegotiation of New Treaty <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese also know that our country will do its best to fight for coastal and inland navigation rights, which is inevitable. Since the Chinese oppose mutual navigation, it is difficult to find a win-win solution, and they have to rush to prepare countermeasures. According to reliable information from the Japanese side, the Japanese shipping merchants in China have secretly held several meetings specifically for this matter. It is reported that the Japanese shipping industry has decided on a method to extend the shipping industry in China. Taking advantage of the renegotiation of the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, the Japanese shipping companies have decided to secretly increase ships in advance. For example, if the Yangtze River has ten regular scheduled ships, then add four or five more. The same is true for the coastal routes. After increasing the number of ships, it will be a countermeasure to our country's reclamation of navigation rights. If we raise this demand, they will sell all the ships to us at a high price to make it difficult for us, and then use the excuse of withdrawing ships in stages, which will increase the number of ships and extend the withdrawal period, so that they will have no losses in practice.</p>
<p>Dalian Actively Increases Ships: The Dalian Steamship Company will actively expand its Chinese shipping business this year. A larger new ship will be added to the Shanghai-Dalian-Qingdao route, which is larger than the Dalian Maru and Fengtian Maru, with a net load of 5,000 tons. The ship has been named Qingdao Maru and is reportedly nearing completion. The passenger seats and cargo holds have been enlarged. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of August and sail on the Shanghai-Qingdao-Dalian route. At the same time, the Sakaki Maru will be replaced and a new route will be opened to Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangzhou. In addition, three ships will be added, which will be completed in September this year and used to expand the business within the South China Shipping Company. In addition, Showa Shipping has opened three routes this year, namely the North and South Ocean routes and the Yangtze River route. Recently, due to the large amount of goods in Wenzhou, in addition to the Lushan Maru, another ship, the Dongyang Maru, has been transferred to Shanghai to increase the Shanghai-Oujiang line. Since February of this year, the number of Japanese coastal ships has gradually increased, which has become a natural common rule.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Further Report on the Multiple Deaths and Injuries from Boat Collisions <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Huangpu Ship Causes Six Deaths of Men and Women</p>
<p>Yesterday's report mentioned that Longshan Steamer of Sanbei Company and Huangpu Steamer of Taikoo Dockyard encountered accidents in the Huangpu River due to strong winds and tides. Numerous boats were damaged, and there were deaths and injuries. It is now learned that before the Huangpu Steamer had the accident, it sank a wooden boat in the Gaomiao section of the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, drowning five women, a very tragic scene. The circumstances of the two ship accidents are reported in detail below.</p>
<p>What Was Learned After the Longshan Steamer Accident: The time of the Longshan Steamer accident was around 11:30 AM. The affected section of the river extended from the Nisshin Company at Laobaidu in the north to the southernmost wharf of Nanyi Taixing in the south, a distance of about one li. More than 20 wooden boats in that section of the riverbank were damaged, and about 10 or more sank. Most of the boat owners have already towed the sunken boats to the beach. Among them, Sun Yugao's sailboat, carrying 21 tons of coal, is still sunk outside the Yitaixing wharf, with the mast protruding above the water. Xiao Chongming, a crew member on Bao A-xiu's foreign-style boat, saw the Longshan Steamer approaching his boat and tried to escape ashore, but was too late and was injured in the head. Afterwards, the water patrol police sent him to the Puxi Chinese Hospital for treatment. According to the boat owners there, a Ningbo Baiguan boat of a certain surname sank to the bottom of the river. All seven people on board fell into the water, and in the chaos, none were rescued. However, when inquiring with the water patrol authorities, they said that they had not received a report, so the truth remains to be verified. Others who were injured either went to the hospital or stayed at home, and the boat owners had scattered yesterday, making it impossible to investigate. It is estimated that the loss of boats and cargo due to the Longshan accident is at least tens of thousands of gold. After the collision between the Nisshin Company's Lushan Maru and the Longshan Steamer, the company unloaded all the cargo from the Lushan Maru yesterday for repairs. The export date of the 16th has been canceled. In addition, the stern of the Yangtze River steamer Dafu Maru, which was docked at Nisshin's No. 3 wharf, was also damaged when the anchor chain was broken when the Lushan Maru was hit. Fortunately, Nisshin Company sent workers to repair it overnight, and it was able to depart as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Details of the Two Accidents Caused by the Huangpu Steamer: The Huangpu Steamer caused two accidents upon entering port, resulting in the deaths of six men and women. The details are as follows: (First Accident) At around 10 AM, the Huangpu Steamer was sailing into the Wusongkou when it reached the Gaomiao area of ​​Pudong. At that time, a Jiangbei boat belonging to Gu Rulong, carrying seven tons of Shanhe soil, was sailing upstream. There were eight people on board: Gu and his wife, two sons, and four daughters. The Huangpu was unable to avoid it in time and violently overturned the boat, causing all eight people to fall into the water. Personnel from the Mobil Oil Company in Pudong saw this and immediately dispatched a gasoline boat to rescue them. Gu and his two sons were rescued on the spot, but Gu's wife and four daughters had already sunk and disappeared. Shortly after, Gu's wife and his eldest and second daughters suddenly floated to the surface. The crew members on the Mobil boat immediately rescued them separately, but they had already died. The three corpses were transported to the Yinxianggang Wharf in Puxi. Gu's third and fourth daughters' bodies drifted away and their whereabouts are unknown. It is reported that the deceased Gu's wife, Liu, was 43 years old and from Jiangbei. Gu's eldest daughter, Guizhen, was 23 years old, his second daughter, Lao Er, was 10 years old, his third daughter, Xiao Lao San, was 7 years old, and his fourth daughter, Si Xiao Mei, was only 3 years old. Gu suffered this great tragedy of family loss and had nowhere to live that night, so he borrowed space in the Yangshupu Water Patrol Police Station. The three bodies recovered were sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall by Detective Zhu Yuncheng from the police station yesterday. The local court sent personnel to examine the bodies and then instructed the family members to collect them for burial and then file a lawsuit. (Second Accident) After the Huangpu Steamer caused the accident in the Gaomiao area, it continued to sail inward. Because the tide was high and the northwest wind was strong, it sailed to the Yangjiadu China Merchants Wharf upstream. It was about to drop anchor and turn around, but the hull was hit by the tide and there was no way to turn around. It crashed into the China Merchants Wharf, damaging the wharf. Several wharf boats docked outside the wharf were also crushed. Among them, Wu Zhangsheng's wharf boat, carrying 100 bags of white rice, was crushed. The cook on the boat, Li Genhe (46 years old, from Changshu), was about to run to avoid danger, but it was too late. His head was immediately crushed, and he fell unconscious on the boat. Several dock workers carried the injured person to the Pudong Hospital for treatment, but he died on the way. The hospital refused to admit him, so the workers carried him back to the dock. The body was exposed overnight until 4 PM yesterday, when no one had collected it for burial. The water patrol police sent Detective Cheng Yongnian to urge the family members to collect the body for burial. It is reported that the affected boat owners have asked the Taikoo Dockyard authorities to compensate for the losses and provide compensation for the innocent victims so that they can handle the funeral.</p>

<p>The Joint Conference of Silk Weaving Mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang recently sent a telegram to silk industry organizations in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Suzhou, Shengjing, Shengze, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jiashu, and Shanghai regarding the issue of reciprocal tariffs between China and Japan, requesting them to jointly appeal. The text of the telegram stated (above omitted): "Reports indicate that the Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity agreement involves preferential tariffs on Japanese manufactured goods in exchange for Chinese raw materials. This means that Chinese manufactured goods shipped to Japan and Korea will not receive the benefits of preferential tariffs. This will severely harm our silk industry. It is imperative that preferential tariffs be applied equally to both Chinese and Japanese manufactured goods, or to raw materials on both sides, in order to be fair and just. In addition to the efforts of this conference, the National Products Preservation Association, the Korean Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and other organizations to strongly appeal to the National Government (telegrams already published in various newspapers), we urge your organizations to immediately respond and jointly appeal to save the silk industry and protect national products. We also hope that you will send a copy of the telegram to this conference." (signed) Jiangsu and Zhejiang Joint Conference of Silk Weaving Mills</p>
<h3 id="e89">Tariff Agreement Unrelated to Secured Loans <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday’s Unofficial Statement from the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>Recorded Here Pending Factual Verification</p>
<p>There have been misunderstandings in various circles regarding the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement draft, specifically regarding the case of securing Japanese old debts due to the ambiguous wording. Some have even suspected that future tariff revenues will be used as collateral for Japanese debts. The Japanese Embassy's office yesterday issued an unofficial statement to clarify these misunderstandings. The statement briefly stated that tariff autonomy in the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement draft pertains solely to tariff rates. In other words, the agreement applies only to tariff matters and does not involve other issues. Loan agreements are governed by their own provisions and are entirely separate from tariff treaties. Even if loan consolidation requires separate collateral, it will not interfere with the tariff treaty. In summary, the tariff treaty regarding tariff autonomy is one issue, and the consolidation of Sino-Japanese loans is another. Any concerns that the two are intertwined are unwarranted.

<h3 id="e95">Labor-Management Dispute Handling Law During the Transition Between New and Old <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>New Law Not Yet Promulgated</p>
<p>Old Law Should Remain Temporarily Effective</p>
<p>The trial period for the Labor-Management Dispute Handling Law expired on the 9th of this month. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and requested the Municipal Government to forward a request to the Central Government to extend the trial period temporarily before the new law is promulgated to avoid a lack of legal basis for action. Yesterday, the Bureau received Municipal Government Instruction No. 3691, ordering them to acknowledge the State Council's telegram stating: "The Labor-Management Dispute Handling Law should remain effective temporarily under the old law until the new law is promulgated." The original order stated: "This government previously telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan to request instructions on whether the trial period for the Labor-Management Dispute Handling Law should be extended and whether the arbitration committee could meet in the absence of an arbitrator. The State Council's original telegram stated: 'Regarding the requests for instructions, the President has instructed that the Labor-Management Dispute Handling Law has been revised by the Legislative Yuan and will be promulgated once submitted to the government. Before the new law is promulgated, the old law should remain temporarily effective. As for arbitrators, according to Article 15 of the current law, they represent each party separately. It is not appropriate to hold a meeting in the absence of one person.' This order is hereby issued to the Bureau for their information."</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Pharmaceutical Industry Dispute Remains Unresolved <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of placing unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry, a mediation meeting was scheduled for 1:00 PM yesterday at the Bureau of Social Affairs. However, the employers' association was unable to hold a general meeting and could not send representatives to the Bureau, causing the labor representatives to waste their time. The mediation was thus aborted. Both sides are arguing with each other in the newspapers, and the debate is becoming increasingly heated, making a resolution unlikely in the short term. The latest news from yesterday is summarized below.</p>
<p>The Workers' Union's Intentions Are Firm: The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union continued to hold a general meeting of members yesterday to discuss important cases. Their intentions are very firm. After the meeting, they went to the Bureau of Social Affairs to await the representatives' response. The number of people was more than 500, and the discipline was extremely strict. There was no shortage of people from various circles who came to express their sympathy.</p>
<p>The Association's Meeting Failed to Take Place: The Pharmaceutical Industry Association was scheduled to hold a general meeting of city-wide members at the National Federation of Pharmaceutical Associations at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. A large number of members attended. Just as they were about to start the meeting, a representative from the City Party Headquarters' Civil Training Committee arrived with an order stating that the meeting had not been approved by the Party Headquarters and could not be held. The attending members immediately obeyed the order and dispersed. The Bureau of Social Affairs had scheduled a mediation committee meeting for 1:00 PM yesterday and had ordered the association to send representatives. However, because the general meeting could not be held, the association could not send representatives. Therefore, the association appointed an employee, Mr. Wang, to the Bureau to explain everything to avoid any misunderstandings on the part of the Bureau. At the same time, they plan to follow the association's procedures and submit a request to the Party Headquarters for approval before notifying and convening a general meeting to discuss and resolve everything.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Chinese Medicine Association: The Chinese Medicine Association sent a letter to the Workers' Union offering to mediate and willing to act as Lu Zhonglian. However, the Workers' Union declined, stating that they would wait for the higher authorities to handle the matter. The association also submitted a request to the City Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, asking them to quickly resolve the difficulty of patients purchasing medicine.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Twists and Turns After the Resolution of the Xihe Yarn Factory Dispute <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Conduct Investigation</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the incident at the Japanese-owned Xihe Yarn Factory in Litanjiadu, where the factory arbitrarily reduced workers' wages, causing a labor-management dispute, was mediated by Tang Liqing, director of civil training in the Third District Party Headquarters. As a result, the factory fully accepted all 14 conditions put forward by the labor side, which the labor side considered satisfactory. Therefore, the dispute has ended. Unexpectedly, yesterday, some reactionary elements, seeing that the factory dispute had subsided and unable to cause further trouble, spread rumors that although the factory had agreed to the conditions, it had not posted a notice, making it difficult to trust. They incited the workers to resist with a strike. Some workers did not investigate the details and followed suit, causing a strike yesterday morning around 9:00 AM. The factory believed that the workers' conditions had been accepted in advance, and that the workers' unjustified strike followed, leading to misunderstandings. It was even rumored that the factory had announced a closure. The Third District Party Headquarters detected the incident and immediately launched an investigation by Tang Liqing, director of civil training. Section Chief Duan Wengong of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau was also investigating the factory. They consulted each other and held talks with both labor and management. It is reported that there is considerable evidence regarding the instigators of this dispute, which is believed to be the work of a few reactionary elements. It is planned to mediate immediately so that the majority of good workers will not be innocently affected.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Provincial Order to Implement Grain Storage <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the grain storage affairs in Shanghai County, the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department previously sent personnel to Shanghai to urge rectification. The county government also submitted the suspected grain storage assets to the Civil Affairs Department for review. It is now learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that some counties only store money instead of grain for grain storage, and this method easily allows unscrupulous people to misappropriate funds, creating loopholes. However, local grain storage is originally intended to prepare for famine and provide disaster relief and should be implemented seriously. Therefore, it has ordered the Civil Affairs Department to have all counties comply. The Shanghai County Government received the order and yesterday sent a letter to the Property Supervision Committee and the Property Department to implement it seriously.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Another Batch of Foreign Currency Arrived Yesterday <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>A large batch of foreign currency from India and Saigon arrived in Shanghai. The third batch of 8 million yuan of foreign currency was transported to Shanghai yesterday by a ship dispatched by a local bank to Wusongwai. Because it could not be transferred in one day, it was transported to Shanghai in two days. Therefore, there is still a batch of imports today, all landed at the Jianghai Customs Wharf, and then withdrawn and stored in the warehouse by a certain foreign bank.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Two Kidnapping Cases Solved Simultaneously Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Both Committed by Notorious Bandits from Jiangbei</p>
<p>The Old Case Involved Abduction and Rape of a Woman in Funing</p>
<p>The New Case Recently Occurred in Pengpu Township</p>
<p>More Than Ten Criminals Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>Liu Zhongyan, a local resident who works as a doctor, lives in a bungalow on the east end of Pengpu Bridge in Pengpu Township. Around 6 PM on Wednesday last week, he was suddenly robbed by Cao bandits, who also kidnapped his four-year-old granddaughter, Huizhen. Liu immediately reported the case to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. Chief Jin believed that this case involved both kidnapping a young child and robbery, which was extremely illegal. He immediately ordered patrol officers to lead the police and cooperate with all the detectives to solve the case quickly. They first arrested a suspected neighbor and then conducted investigations in all directions, sparing no effort. The day before yesterday, a Funing resident named Qiu Yinbiao reported to the station that his fellow villager, Hong Yinyuan, was a notorious bandit from Jiangbei. Two years ago, he kidnapped his sister, Xu Qiu, and his niece, Xiao Yatou, and secretly came to Shanghai to hide, raping his sister and making her his wife. It has now been discovered that the bandit Hong Yinyuan lives in Tanjiabao. He requested that police be dispatched to arrest him immediately. Upon receiving the information, Chief Jin immediately ordered detectives to go to the address and arrest Hong Yinyuan, along with Xu Qiu, Xiao Yatou, and three others. Xu Qiu finally saw the light of day after two years of suffering and described Hong Yinyuan's various illegal activities in detail. She also said that she had heard that Hong had kidnapped a four-year-old girl in the past two or three days, but she did not know where she was hiding. Chief Jin immediately interrogated Hong Yinyuan strictly, and he confessed to the kidnapping of Liu Zhongyan's four-year-old granddaughter, Huizhen. Thereupon, patrol officers, police, and detectives were mobilized overnight and searched the hiding places of Hong's accomplices, arresting more than ten criminals. Finally, at around 11 AM yesterday, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station in the Public Concession, they safely rescued the four-year-old hostage, Xu Huizhen, in a shack on Meizhou Road. Both the old and new kidnapping cases were solved simultaneously. What is particularly noteworthy is that the arrest of the bandit leader, the search for the accomplices, and the recovery of the hostage were all achieved without firing a single shot or injuring anyone. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Robbery and Kidnapping: Around 6 PM on the 12th of this month, that is, Wednesday last week, Liu Zhongyan and his guests were having dinner when six or seven bandits dressed in short clothes and speaking with a northern accent broke into the house through the back door to rob them. Because Liu's eldest son, Yinsheng, had just returned from Shanghai in his own chartered car, the bandits waited outside the house and were able to follow him inside. At that time, they took out their pistols and forbade anyone from making a sound. The bandits in the yard kidnapped Liu's four-year-old granddaughter, Xiao Huizhen, who was being held by his daughter-in-law, Guo. They also robbed the house of fox fur robes, fox fur jackets, gold rings, gold bracelets, and cash, worth a total of hundreds of yuan, and escaped. Afterwards, Xu immediately reported the incident to the Taiyangmiao police station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. The Pengpu Township Defense Corps also arrived at the scene to arrest the bandits, but the bandits had disappeared without a trace. However, that night, the four suspected neighbors, Lu Zhengxuan, Lu Jinyun, Lu Zhengbao, and Lu Zhou, were detained at the station. The chief ordered detectives to work hard to investigate and solve the case as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Abduction and Rape: One day later, on the afternoon of the 10th, a Funing resident named Qiu Yinbiao reported to the station that his sister, Xu Qiu, had been kidnapped by the notorious local bandit Hong Yinyuan on the 10th day of the second month of the lunar calendar in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). His nine-year-old niece, Xiao Yatou, was also abducted at the same time. The sister's husband, Xu Yinshan, who made cakes for a living, escaped, but his house was burned down by Hong and he was left homeless. After kidnapping Qiu and Xiao Yatou, Hong Yinyuan secretly came to Shanghai at the end of the ninth month of the lunar calendar last year and committed rape. At first, he hid in Sanyang Road and later moved to the current address, Tan Ding Lane. Qiu Yinbiao came to Shanghai once last year and found out about it, but he did not dare to act rashly because he was isolated and weak. This spring, he came to Shanghai again with his sister's husband and found that Hong had moved to Tan Jia Lane. After a long period of research, he finally found him and asked the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to send police to arrest him.</p>
<p>Overnight Arrests: Police and detectives went to Tanjiabao and brought Hong, Xu Qiu, Xiao Yatou, and others to the station. Xu Qiu revealed all the details of what had happened. She also said that Hong did not return home on the 13th. The next morning, Hong's daughter-in-law visited and said that Hong Yinyuan had kidnapped a four-year-old girl somewhere, but it was not clear where she was hiding. When Hong Yinyuan was questioned, he initially denied it, then said that the matter was done by someone else and he did not know where she was currently hiding. After repeated questioning, he finally said that the hostage was now in Yangshupu, and then said that she was in Shenxinli, Sanyang Road Sanyangli, and other places. Police and detectives went to each of these addresses to arrest several accomplices. They also confessed that the hostage was hidden near Tanjiabao, or in a shack on Hutai Road, or in Jinxiuli on Guangzhao Road. They ran around all night, but there was still no news. They went to Yangshupu and other places two or three times or more.</p>
<p>Hostage Rescued: It was not until 11 AM yesterday that the real location of the hostage was discovered. Patrol Officers Gong and Xia, along with Detective Liu and Chief Police Jiang Zhuxian, went to the Yangshupu Police Station and explained the situation. They joined forces with Chinese and Western detectives from the station, fully armed, and rescued the hostage in a shack in the wilderness behind the Shuyuan on Meizhou Road. At that time, there were two old women watching the hostage, and there were also men and little girls at the door and in the room. When the police and detectives entered the door, Xu Huizhen was sleeping on the bed. The bandits seemed to have no defense, so the hostage was safely rescued and taken back to the station to be handed over to the victim. After interrogating the arrested bandits, they will be sent to the Judicial Section for review. The solving of these two old and new cases was extremely swift.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Case of a Maidservant's Poisoning: Master Accused of Murder <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Suicide or Beaten to Death?</p>
<p>Plaintiff Requests Forensic Examination by a Western Doctor</p>
<p>Witness Claims Beating Over One Dollar</p>
<p>Master Recounts the Events Leading to Poisoning</p>
<p>Wang Wangshi, a 26-year-old woman from Anhui Province employed as a maidservant by Wang Senchang at his lumberyard on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, had been working for only half a month when she allegedly committed suicide by poison on February 5th of this year. Wang reported the incident to the police, who transported her to the hospital, where she died. Her body was taken to the morgue. Upon reporting to the French Court, Judge Zhu arrived to inspect the body. The deceased's father, Wang Xunzuo, claimed that his daughter-in-law had been beaten to death by her employer. An order was issued for a forensic examination by a Western doctor. Furthermore, Wang Xunzuo claimed that he was too poor to afford a coffin and burial. The Tongren Fuyuantang charity was ordered to provide a coffin and arrange the burial. Wang Xunzuo then retained lawyer Li Shirui to draft a formal complaint to the French Court, criminally accusing Wang Senchang of murdering the maidservant and seeking compensation. Yesterday, a summons was issued. The plaintiff's lawyer, Fei Xizhen, argued that according to the deceased's family, the woman was beaten to death by Wang Senchang and his wife. Whether she committed suicide by poison or was beaten to death could only be determined by a detailed examination by a Western doctor. If the examination revealed suicide, the case would be closed. However, if it proved she was beaten to death, the defendant should be held criminally responsible and liable for damages. Witness Wang Deshun testified that the deceased was his younger brother's wife. Last December, he visited her and learned that the employer had held a gambling party, and a certain gambler won, giving the deceased one silver dollar. At that time, the employer's wife scolded her for keeping it all to herself and said she should share it with the nanny. The deceased was then beaten several times. He knew nothing else. Wang Senchang testified that the deceased had been working as a maid for only half a month. On February 5th, witness Wang Deshun arrived and went out with the deceased. They returned at 9:30 PM, and she went to bed. Around midnight, he heard groaning from her room. He became suspicious and knocked on the door. Seeing her pale face, he suspected something was wrong. He reported it to the police, who took her to the hospital, where she soon died. A Western doctor examined the body and concluded that she had committed suicide by poison and had not been murdered. He denied beating her and pleaded for a fair investigation. Judge Zhu dismissed the case and adjourned it for a future hearing.</p>

<p>Harassment on the Road</p>
<p>Gathering a Crowd to Assault</p>
<p>Agreeing on a Time for Revenge</p>
<p>Multiple Arrests</p>
<p>A 15-year-old daughter of a man named Qian, residing at Zhu Jiajiao in Tangjiexi, Xujiahui, worked at a silk factory in Caojiadu, commuting daily. Recently, she was harassed on the road by a group of thugs on Haig Road. The daughter reported this to her father and brothers, who went to reason with the thugs. After mediation, the matter was settled. However, on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, at about 7:00 PM, Qian's daughter was returning home from work when the thugs drove up from behind in a rented car near Ligongmiao and slapped her several times. Unable to resist, she cried and went home. Considering the matter had been resolved, her brother felt it was wrong for her to be beaten again. Thus, on the previous evening (the 14th) at 8:00 PM, both sides gathered hundreds of people, armed with weapons, to discuss the matter at the Changchunlou teahouse in Xujiahui. Fortunately, the French police discovered this and sent detectives to arrest several individuals and confiscate numerous weapons. At the same time, the Second Precinct of the Sixth District also arrested a dozen or so people, while the rest scattered and fled.</p>

<p>Sailors Pulling Rickshaws in Public</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Seated Grandly</p>
<p>Collision with a Car Leads to Negotiations</p>
<p>Paying All Their Money and Apologizing</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, on Thursday evening, two foreign sailors on Avenue Edward VII suddenly had the idea of having rickshaw pullers sit grandly while they pulled the rickshaws themselves, parading through the streets. They were followed by dozens of curious onlookers. When they reached the vicinity of the Great World entertainment center, the rickshaw's shaft collided with a car in front, damaging its headlight. The car belonged to a French citizen, who became enraged and demanded satisfaction. The sailors repeatedly apologized, but the Frenchman refused and insisted on compensation of five dollars. The sailors emptied their pockets and found only eight dimes and ten copper coins. They were then taken to the French Concession police station. After much arguing, the Frenchman reluctantly accepted the apology and left with the eight dimes and ten copper coins. The sailors also returned to their ship, frustrated and no longer wishing to pull rickshaws.</p>

<p>Sentenced to One and a Half Months of Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, a group of young people calling themselves the "Propaganda Team of the China Art Vocational School" set out in formation with banners to give speeches in support of the unemployed workers of the Xiangchang Cotton Mill in the French Concession. The banners were made of paper and bore the words "Propaganda Team of the China Art Vocational School." They also carried two types of printed materials: a declaration from the general assembly of the students of the China Art University in support of the Xiangchang tragedy and a declaration from the representatives of all sectors of the Zhabei District in support of the Xiangchang tragedy. They distributed these materials along the way. As the team passed North Sichuan Road in the concession, a Japanese policeman from the 58th precinct of the Disweilu (Dixwell Road) station happened to be passing by on a tram. Seeing them from the window, he got off the tram and summoned Japanese policemen numbers 110, 128, and 93, etc. They arrested Zhang Wei from Guizhou, Zhou Tongren from Shandong, Luo Yiling from Hubei, and Huang Zheng and Zhang Yiming from Jiangsu, a total of five people. They confiscated six paper banners and one hundred leaflets and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Detective Wang Jie and Western Detective Esui escorted them to the Provisional Court, where Judge Wang Jianzu interrogated them. The police charged them with sedition under Article 103 of the criminal law. First, the Japanese policemen testified about the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants and presented the banners and leaflets as evidence. The defendants all stated that they were out raising donations to help the workers. After reviewing the leaflets, Judge Wang informed the defendants that they contained propaganda against the Three Principles of the People and were contrary to the policies of the National Government, thus violating Article 103 of the criminal law. He sentenced each of them to one and a half months of imprisonment and ordered the confiscation of the banners and leaflets.</p>

<p>Patrol officers from the First Precinct of the Second District arrested Chen Ziqing and Zhang Daquan near Fangbang Bridge in Ximen on the anniversary of March 8th for distributing reactionary leaflets in public. They confiscated thirteen leaflets of two kinds and took them to the police station. It was discovered that the leaflets were printed by the Communist Party, and the language was absurd, inciting strikes. The defendants confessed that they were from Taixing and were hired to distribute these leaflets starting from Taixing in December of last year and all the way to Shanghai. The case was clearly reactionary and was reported to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, they were transferred to the District Court for a preliminary hearing, and an order was issued for their detention pending submission to the High Court for review.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government's Committee for the Construction of Civilian Housing is handling the construction of civilian housing. Previously, the First Civilian Housing project, consisting of one hundred units and a community hall, was built on Quanjia'an Road in Zhabei. The committee also designated the vacant land at the intersection of Xietu Road and Luban Road on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau property in Nanshi as the site for the Second Civilian Housing project. Recently, for overall planning purposes, the committee selected four suitable locations in other districts of the city based on the number of shantytowns and the needs of the population: (1) south of Zhongshan Road, north of Zhonghua Xin Road, west of Changxing Road, and east of the Shanghai-Taicang Automobile Road in Zhabei; (2) north of the Suzhou Creek in Caojiadu and south of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway; (3) north of the Wusong Yunzaobang River and west of the North Sitang River; (4) east of the Caonitang River in Pudong. These six locations, including the existing First and Second Civilian Housing projects, have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.

The bureau has already issued notification forms to the rickshaw trade association and the North Shanghai Rickshaw Merchants Association, instructing them to properly allocate donation quotas and inspection dates and distribute them accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Conclusion of the Fang Family Inheritance Dispute Hearing <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Discrepancies in the Testimony Regarding the Amount of Gold Pounds</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 24th</p>
<p>Fang Dacang, son of the deceased Fang Danchi, claimed that after his father's death, the certificates of deposit worth over 200,000 yuan and gold pounds and gold leaves worth over 4,000 yuan were stolen by his father's concubine, Deng, in collusion with her father, Deng Guannan, and Wang Shutang, among others. He retained lawyer Zhan Jifeng and filed a complaint with the Provisional Court, which issued summons for Deng and her father. Wang also surrendered to the court. After several hearings, all of which were reported in this newspaper, Judge Luo Renxiang held another hearing yesterday afternoon. First, Wang Shutang, the owner of Jufeng Lumber, was questioned about purchasing a coffin for Fang Danchi. Wang said he used gold pounds as temporary collateral for the coffin price and later redeemed the gold pounds with cash. Then, Zhang A'gen, a tea server at the Hongkou Hotel, testified that the hotel's Room 19 was booked by a Deng surname, who went into the room with Fang and a child. The window of the room faced the street. Fang occasionally went out at night and did not return. The room had only one couch, and Deng also went out frequently, acting freely and without restraint. Judge Luo then questioned Deng about the number of gold pounds she possessed. Deng stated that her husband gave her eighty small gold pounds. After her husband's death, Fang Fengchi took away forty-four of them, so she previously stated that she had thirty-six. Fang Fengchi then entered the witness box and vehemently declared to the court that Deng's testimony was entirely false. He also recounted Wang Shutang's deceitful behavior during the funeral. He said that Wang had become friends with his brother and should not have acted in such a way before his brother's body was cold. He added that last October, Wang came to his house, and he sternly rebuked him, to which Wang remained silent. Then, Fang Dacang stated that Deng had told him after his father's death that she knew his father had a deposit of 30,000 yuan in the Siming Bank and 30,000 taels in the Meifeng Bank, proving that there was indeed an inheritance. Judge Luo questioned Deng, who said that she had mentioned the 30,000 yuan, but the certificates in the safe were taken away by Fang Hechi, who was now in Hankou. The court advised Deng that if she had concealed any property, she should hand it over, otherwise she would be held accountable if it was discovered in the future and could not continue to embezzle it. However, Deng insisted that she had not taken a single penny. Lawyer Zhan then stated that Deng had also told Bao Lingfeng about the deposit and could call Bao as a witness. Bao, who was present in the audience, immediately testified that Deng had indeed said at his home that there was a deposit of 30,000 yuan in Siming and 30,000 taels in Meifeng. She said that she wanted him to ask the Fang family for a share of the inheritance. She also said that the Siming certificate was red and the Meifeng certificate was green. The court then ordered the start of the debate. First, lawyer Zhan stated that Deng's statements were full of contradictions. For example, she initially claimed to have thirty gold pounds, then thirty-six, and finally eighty. This alone was enough to prove her dishonesty. As for the gold leaves, she never mentioned them. Wang Shutang's relationship was even more evident from his arrival in Shanghai this time. As a young widow, she did not stay with Fang's relatives but at Wang's home, which was self-evident. Furthermore, Wang Shutang's accounts did not match, and the Jufeng's accounting books were also suspicious. Deng Guannan appeared flustered when he met the plaintiff on the ship coming to Shanghai. Therefore, except for Wang Dahan, who had not yet been brought to court, the defendants in this case were guilty of joint theft and should be punished according to law and ordered to hand over all the account books. Next, the lawyers for Deng and her father argued that the plaintiff had not presented any evidence. If Deng had indeed stolen anything, she would not have returned to Huanggang. Finally, lawyer Jiang Yiping defended Wang Shutang, saying that Wang was only temporarily keeping the items and had already returned them, so there was no question of collusion in theft. After the arguments, Judge Luo announced that the sentence would be pronounced on the afternoon of March 24. Deng and her father and Wang Shutang were released on bail by their lawyers. Then, the lawyers for the Fang and Deng parties debated the cases of Fang accusing Deng of false accusation and Deng accusing Fang of obstructing freedom. Judge Luo granted lawyer Zhan's request to withdraw the false accusation case and set the sentencing date for the Deng case for the afternoon of March 24.</p>

Just as Wei was anxious, a Shandong man named Yin Baode, who cooked at the Public Security Bureau, came to Wei's house early this month and said that his daughter was now in Nanshi and that she could be found if a certain amount of silver dollars was paid. Wei immediately suspected that since he knew where his daughter was, he must have been the one who abducted her. He immediately turned him over to the police station in the Sixth District. After separate interrogations by Section Chief Duan, it was determined that Yin was suspected of extortion and was turned over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.

<p>Accused of Raping and Injuring a Young Girl</p>
<p>With a Doctor's Certificate</p>
<p>Xu Xiangsheng, from Songjiang, and his wife worked in Shanghai, living at No. 1436 Zhangjiashe, Gordon Road. On November 4th of last year, A'fu, the brother of Xu's second landlord, Zheng Jinfu, took advantage of Xu and his wife being out at work and lured Xu's eight-year-old daughter, Jvdi, to the kitchen. He made her lie on a stool and committed a heinous act. When Xu and his wife returned home, their daughter told them that her lower body had been violated. They negotiated with A'fu, who promised to pay for the medical expenses, so they tolerated it without saying anything. However, A'fu later broke his promise. Xu filed a complaint with the Gordon Road police station. The police chief said that it had been too long and there was not enough evidence, so he did not accept the case. Xu was not satisfied and sent his daughter to Baolong Hospital for an examination. The doctor confirmed that the girl's hymen had been damaged, her vagina was swollen and red, and there was also swelling next to the pubic bone. There was also inflammation in the bladder. The doctor gave Xu a diagnostic certificate. Xu then retained lawyer Fan Gang to accuse Zheng A'fu of raping a young girl in the Provisional Court, requesting that he be punished according to law to maintain social mores and punish the wicked. A warrant was issued, but the defendant fled to avoid punishment. A warrant was then issued, and Chinese constable No. 2221 from the Huishi police station discovered that Zheng was hiding in Luodian. He reported it to the Luodian Public Security Bureau, who sent police to arrest him and bring him back to the police station. He was escorted to the court yesterday morning for investigation. The defendant also retained a lawyer to defend him, claiming that the defendant's surname was actually Jin and that the address was also incorrect, so he did not receive the summons. He also claimed that he was falsely accused in this case. When the defendant was questioned, he stated that his name was Jin A'fu, 40 years old, and that he worked as a bricklayer for the Municipal Council. The court asked him if he had any defense against the charges. Jin denied everything. Judge Zhou ordered the defendant to post bail of 150 yuan and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Submits a Request to Support the US Senate Proposal</p>
<p>Commissioner Wang Yiting of the Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee has repeatedly received telegrams from Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui and other provinces reporting on the disastrous situation, which is extremely severe. Representatives from Henan, Zhou Xiwen, Zhang Lie, Qu Wanshan, Song Guoliang, and Chen Linren, representative of the Henan Disaster Relief Association in Beiping, have also come to Shanghai to personally describe the disaster situation in various locations, almost tearfully. Commissioner Wang, being charitable and committed to relief, previously, together with Chairman Xu Jingren, repeatedly requested the government to continue issuing 10 million yuan in disaster relief bonds to facilitate spring relief efforts in various provinces. However, the Ministry of Finance stated that the bond fund was not available and could not be issued, and the committee had no large amount of funds to raise, causing deep anxiety. Seeing in the newspaper that the US Senate proposed allocating 25 million yuan to purchase relief grain for transportation to China for disaster relief, he wrote to Chairman Jiang yesterday, first stating the importance of spring relief and requesting the government to support the US proposal to allocate US dollars to purchase and transport wheat flour to China for disaster relief, to promptly bring the matter to a meeting and realize it as soon as possible. On the one hand, he requested that the Ministry of Finance allocate a large sum of money from nowhere to purchase seeds for distribution to various provinces for planting, in the hope of a promising autumn harvest. He also requested that the disaster victims in Henan Province be relocated to Liaoning and Ningxia provinces to cultivate wasteland and work as laborers, etc., as a fundamental plan for famine relief. In recent days, Commissioner Wang attended the Hua Yang Joint Relief Association, the Chinese Jisheng Association, and the Red Cross Relief Conference, and announced the severity of the disasters in Shaanxi and Henan provinces to the public, requesting the collection of funds for relief. The Hua Yang Joint Relief Association has allocated 120,000 yuan and remitted it to Henan Province for distribution by the association's branch. The Jisheng Association also plans to raise funds for relief in Henan, it is said.</p>

<p>The Jisheng Association recently received a letter from the Henan Provincial Relief Committee reporting that the disaster situation in Henan Province is worsening, and the number of refugees is increasing daily. Currently, nearly 100,000 disaster victims are gathered in Luoyang, Zheng County, Kaifeng and other places, fleeing across the river. Because Xin, Mian, Luo, Yi and other counties still have roads to exit, while the traffic in Shaan, Ling, Wen, Lu, Bao, Yi and other counties is blocked, and about 5 million people are trapped and waiting to die. In addition, they have suffered from war, and more than 40 local counties, extending over 1,000 miles, have had their houses burned, grains and materials looted, with wails everywhere, food cut off, and deaths following one after another. Rescue is urgently needed, and we ask to appeal on behalf of the millions of disaster victims in Henan Province, to provide relief grain and relief goods to save their remaining lives, etc. The severity of the disaster in Shaanxi in recent years is unprecedented, and the current situation of the disaster in Henan is no less than that in Shaanxi. Millions of disaster victims are begging to appeal, hoping that charitable and benevolent people will broadly extend universal relief to save people's lives in the event of a disaster.</p>

One section of it, approximately 1,580 zhang long, is particularly heavily silted and requires urgent dredging. According to the Port Authority's estimate, the cost of the project is approximately 7,000 yuan. In addition to the 2,000 yuan raised by the people in the district, the remaining 5,000 yuan has been approved by the Municipal Government, ordering the Finance Bureau to allocate the funds.</p>

<p>A meningitis epidemic has occurred in Yangxing Township, Baoshan County, and many people have died. This newspaper has reported on it.

Wei Bin, Dean of Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, has been ordered by the Ministry of Health, and on the afternoon before last, together with doctors Wang Xun and Dong Shi, went from the province to Bao to investigate the epidemic situation, in order to find ways to provide relief.

Dean Wei said that Baoshan does not have a specialized hospital or excellent doctors, and epidemic prevention work will definitely be difficult. Therefore, Doctor Wang was specifically sent to stay in Baoshan temporarily to preside over the handling of epidemic prevention affairs. On the one hand, the county government and local gentry and businessmen will find ways to set up specialized hospitals, so as to obtain a one-time and permanent solution.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tennis and volleyball performances were excellent.</p>
<p>The situation today at the six venues for swimming, soccer, basketball, and other events.</p>
<p>The 15th was the third day of the Shanghai Special City Games. The ball game competitions included volleyball and tennis, held in separate venues, from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Discontinuation of Group Tickets</p>
<p>The purpose of selling tickets for this Games is to subsidize the expenses of sending representatives to the National Games. This measure was originally a last resort.</p>
<p>The first two days of the Games focused on track and field events. The organizing committee believes that the Chinese people do not pay much attention to track and field events, which have repeatedly failed in the Far Eastern Games. Many</p>
<p>ate glutinous rice balls and left disappointed. Therefore, for this type of event, schools and organizations were specially allowed to visit to promote it. From yesterday onwards, without track and field events, all non-participating athletes and staff members must purchase tickets to enter the venue, so as to match the budget.</p>
<p>Not Many Visitors</p>
<p>Yesterday's volleyball and tennis matches were all preliminary rounds, which were less attractive. In addition, at 3:00 PM, Lehua and Xibu competed in soccer at the China Baseball Field. Many spectators abandoned this venue for that one. Therefore, those sitting upright in the stands were quite sparse. According to the statistics, the total number of people throughout the day was no more than a thousand.</p>
<p>Order Still Good</p>
<p>The task of maintaining order at the venue was still undertaken by the Guanghua Boy Scouts. Because there were few spectators, the work was not as tense as the previous two days. It is said that starting tomorrow, the Huaguang Boy Scouts will not be able to attend due to preparations for school midterms. The order at the venue will be maintained by the East Asia Physical Education College Boy Scouts. Yesterday's volleyball results:</p>
<p>Men's Volleyball Match</p>
<p>(1) Fudan defeated Jiaotong with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, the volleyball teams of Fudan and Jiaotong Universities competed at the China Track and Field Stadium. Fudan has always been famous, and Jiaotong is also a strong opponent. When they took the field, Fudan took the lead step by step, taking the lead with a score of 11-5. After switching sides, Jiaotong's momentum suddenly became fierce, and the score increased repeatedly, but there was ultimately no chance to surpass. Fudan won the first game with a score of 21-9. When the second game started, Jiaotong's vigor was strong, and Fudan defended in every possible way, quite busy. The competition became extremely fierce. Jiaotong suddenly took the lead with a score of 6-1. After that, Fudan suddenly gained momentum. Cao Tingzan exerted great force to kill, making it impossible for the opponent to recover. The score gradually approached, and suddenly exceeded, taking the lead to reach 11. When switching directions, Jiaotong only had 8 points. After that, Fudan's momentum was stronger than Jiaotong's. Jiaotong's formation was flustered and declined. Fudan then won the second game with a score of 21-13. Fudan's front-row fighters still lack strength, and the defense is not good. Cao Tingzan's spikes can be used in any position, and the strength is very sufficient, making it extremely difficult to save. He is truly an outstanding talent. As for Xie Baochang's serve and Li Fujun's pass and defense, they are all very skilled. On Jiaotong's side, Li Xinbiao, the backbone, is the most outstanding, and the others are also average. The formations of the two teams are as follows: (2) Fudan defeated Zhonggong again with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Starting at 1:00 PM, Fudan took advantage of the victory and competed with Zhonggong again. The momentum was unparalleled. Zhonggong took the lead, and the serve was not effective, while Fudan's Cao Tingzan stood firmly in the center, jumping up to kill, and defending left and right. His hands and eyes were both agile and strong. The elegant name of Flying General is undoubtedly worthy of him. However, Zhonggong is not comparable to a clown. The talents are well-organized, and the formation is strict. Chen Baoqiu's interception and kill of the incoming ball is particularly skillful. The result was 2-0, and Fudan won. The scores were 21-15 in the first game and 21-14 in the second game. The referee was Li Feiyun. (3) Hujiang defeated Daxia with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Starting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Hujiang began to fight with Daxia. Although the fighters in this game were brave, there were very few highlights, because both sides were not skilled enough. The first game was 21-6, and Daxia won. The second game was 21-7, and Hujiang won. The situation was very bland. The third game was the key to victory or defeat. The fighters on both sides naturally worked harder. When exchanging positions, it was 11-10, and Hujiang was only one point ahead. However, Hujiang moved forward bravely, and Daxia lingered without progress, and finally lost again with a score of 21-11, resulting in a score of 2-1. It is a pity. The referee was Chen Deming. Women's Volleyball Match</p>
<p>(1) Wuben defeated Liangjiang with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00 AM, the women's volleyball teams of Wuben and Liangjiang met at the China Track and Field Stadium and fought fiercely. As a result, Wuben won with a score of 2-0. It is found that Wuben was the champion of last year's city volleyball competition, and its strength is very sufficient. Overcoming Liangjiang seems not difficult. Moreover, Liangjiang's players have been out of practice for a long time, and they are not enough to compete. However, although the strength is weak, the players still strive to fight and are unwilling to show weakness, so the situation is quite spectacular. In the end, Wuben won two games in a row with scores of 21-7 and 21-14. (2) Minli defeated Feixing with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Starting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Minli and Feixing teams began to contact. Feixing just emerged, and although they fought bravely, they were generally correct. However, it is inevitable that they were flustered on the spot and the formation was scattered. Moreover, the enemy team was the Minli team, which has been famous in Shanghai for a long time. Once they fought, they fell apart, which was also expected. Therefore, they lost the first game with a score of 0-21. The serve only reached four. After the people's hearts were settled in the first game, the formation became strict. Although Minli finally won again with a score of 21-16, it took a lot of effort. Judging from the situation of yesterday's battle, Minli's technology seems to have made little progress compared to the past. At 1:30 PM today, they will have a final with the up-and-coming Wuli team. Who will win is really difficult to predict. Although Feixing is a newly formed team, its spirit of perseverance is commendable. With a considerable period of training, it will not be difficult to become a strong team. Yesterday's tennis results:</p>
<p>Only Men's Singles</p>
<p>The results of the men's singles tennis match on the 15th are as follows:</p>
<p>Yan Rongsheng defeated Yang Zhuoping with a score of 6-2, 6-1</p>

<p>(1) Basketball Finals</p>
<p>East-West vs. Qingguang</p>
<p>8:00 PM, Basketball Gym</p>
<p>The Qingguang and East-West teams are the two outstanding teams in the Shanghai basketball world. Since the opening, they have been invincible in the preliminary and semi-final rounds. The abundance of talents and the excellence of skills on both sides have long been admired. At 8:00 PM tonight, they will meet in the final game. They are irreconcilable and determined to win. A fierce battle is undoubtedly expected. Those who love to see the skills of both sides should come early, because the China Basketball Gym has limited space, and it will be difficult to find a seat if you are late. The referee is Zhang Guoxun.</p>
<p>Also, starting at 7:00 PM, there will be a women's game between Southeast and Liangjiang. Although the outcome has nothing to do with the championship, because the skills of the two schools are skilled and the strengths are balanced, there will also be an exciting competition. The referee is Song Junfu. (2) Volleyball Finals</p>
<p>Minli vs. Wuben</p>
<p>The game starts at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Men's game postponed to tomorrow</p>
<p>The preliminary and semi-final rounds of the men's and women's volleyball groups have been held in order yesterday. The teams that won the right to the final in the men's group are Fudan and Hujiang Universities. Now, Hujiang cannot play on Sunday due to school regulations, so the final will be postponed to 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The teams that won the right to the final in the women's group are Minli and Wuben. They will still follow the original schedule and compete for the final victory at the China Track and Field Stadium starting at 1:30 PM this afternoon. The referee is Jiang Xiangqing. This battle seems to be worth seeing. (3) Soccer Preliminary</p>
<p>Huale vs. Youyou</p>
<p>3:00 PM, Baseball Field</p>
<p>The teams that joined the soccer championship include Jiaotong, Youyou, Jinan, and Huale. The knockout system is adopted for the competition, and all games will be held at the baseball field. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Huale vs. Youyou, 3:00 PM today, Referee: Le Xiurong</p>
<p>(2) Jiaotong vs. Jinan, 3:30 PM tomorrow, Referee: Li Silian</p>
<p>(3) The final between the two winning teams, 4:00 PM on the 18th, Referee: Le Xiurong. The skills of Jinan and Jiaotong have long been famous in Shanghai and need not be described. The Youyou team has also been slightly expanded, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper. What outsiders do not know is the content of the Huale team. Huale is based on Lehua, removing the players from Jinan and Jiaotong Universities, and combining with the athletes from Shanghai University who won the China Association championship this year. The basic team members include Zhou Xianyan as the goalkeeper, Li Ning and Li Shouhua as the defenders, Sun Sijing as the backbone, Xi Qiaosheng as the right wing, and Li Huitang (captain) as the left inside forward. The distribution of other positions is roughly as follows: "Forward Line": Hu Minteng, Zhuang Song, Ouyang Yongyuan, Lin Guangxing "Forward Line": Qian Jingfu (left wing), Liu Xinghua (inside forward), Huang Jiaoyan (center forward), Pang Panfang (right inside forward), Wang Jihuai (inside forward), Chen Qi (inside forward), Lu Wenxiang (wing). It can be said that there are many talents. With this lineup, competing against Youyou will definitely have a good performance, giving the audience a new experience. A grand occasion can be predicted. (4) Tennis Match</p>
<p>Men's Singles</p>
<p>(1) Rong Yansheng vs. Wu Shaoxiang, 10:30 AM</p>
<p>(2) Li Huitang vs. Zheng Guangyuan, 9:30 AM</p>
<p>(3) Yu Tianguang vs. Shen Meizhen, 9:30 AM</p>
<p>(4) Qian Yaobin vs. Zheng Zhaojia, 10:30 AM. Women's Singles</p>
<p>The women's singles was originally scheduled to start on the afternoon of the 18th. Now, because there are enough tennis courts, the preliminary round is specially advanced to today. Also, according to accurate inquiries, the previous article that Ms. Li Yun from Java defeated Liang Guansong was a mistake for Ms. Li Lian, the younger sister. Yunhua is not the best among the four sisters. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chen Xinyuan vs. Qiu Fumin, 1:30 PM</p>
<p>(2) Li Lian vs. Kuai Shuping, 1:30 PM. (5) Baseball Match</p>
<p>Jiaotong vs. Fudan</p>
<p>10:00 AM, Baseball Field</p>
<p>Only Jiaotong and Fudan are participating in the baseball game. The game will be held at the China Baseball Field at 10:00 AM today. Umpire: Zhang Guoxun, Base Umpire: Li Baojun, Recorder: Le Xiurong. Also, the old members of the Shanghai China team who are willing to attend the National Games competition are hoped to come to the field for individual practice for the selection of the committee. Because the strength of this delegation is weak, the committee hopes to have veterans to form the team. Baseball Committee members Liu Dasheng and Huang Wenjian are also hoped to be present to discuss various matters with Zhang and Li. (6) Swimming Competition</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 PM tonight</p>
<p>China YMCA</p>
<p>The swimming competition will be held at the China YMCA swimming pool on Sichuan Road starting at 6:00 PM tonight, under the full authority of Ling Xitao. All staff members and guards must attend on time. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>Shanghai Wins Championship in International Basketball Men's Tournament</p>
<p>Defeated the United States 42-27 last night</p>
<p>Jews defeated Korea 41-36</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Basketball Championship, which was rumored for a while, saw the Chinese and American teams defeat Korea, Jews, Portugal, etc., and met in the morning after last night to compete for this year's championship. As a result, China defeated the United States 42-29 and won this year's championship. The excellence of the performance and the fierceness of the competition between the two teams can be said to be unprecedented. The solid formation, beautiful connection, and rapid movements of the Chinese team, as well as the bravery of Lu Zhongen, were applauded and praised by more than a thousand spectators. Another group, Jews defeated Korea, 41 to 36. Captain Lu's Hard Work and High Achievement</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, the captain of the Chinese team, commanded the whole team and was concerned in every way, which can be said to be meticulous. He also monitored Shi Guiya, so that Shi had no chance to connect. As a result, the strength of the United States was reduced and they could not use their skills. Lu observed where the emptiness was, and immediately rushed to help, repeatedly seeing miraculous achievements. He scored more than 20 points alone, which was not easy. The amount of scoring is not enough to discuss heroes, but Lu's performance is excellent, and the four words "outstanding talent" are worthy of him. Hard work and high achievement are commendable. Members of the Chinese Team Connect with Each Other</p>
<p>Among the whole team, center He Tong and left forward Liang Guoquan were slightly weak. When he came on the court, He was quite brave, but in the end, he was weakened by lack of strength. Right forward Wei Haiqing showed great skill and was invaluable. He also monitored the opponent's defender Sullivan, so that Sullivan had no chance to carry out secret operations. Defender Li Baojun moved like a rabbit and was as quiet as a virgin. He deserved to be an old general on the battlefield and monitored Smith without leaving an inch. Therefore, Smith's score was very low. The United States relied on Smith's accurate throwing of the basket. Yesterday, after being supervised by Li, he was unable to do anything. The American Team Lacked Throwing Opportunities</p>
<p>On the American team's side, because the two brave generals, Shi Guiya and Smith, were closely guarded by Lu Zhongen and Li Baojun of our team, the American team lost its center of gravity. Center Hannes was also entangled by A Liang. The defenders Euler and Sullivan were no less brave than before, but because our team had good connections, ran through left and right, and were extremely difficult to block, there were gaps everywhere. In addition, Sullivan had few opportunities to throw the basket, and Euler's distant throw was inaccurate, so he made few achievements. The most obvious point between the two sides was the opportunity to throw the basket. The United States lacked the opportunity to throw the basket under the basket, and the Chinese team gradually won. There were very few long shots. From this point, we can know that the Chinese team's precautions were strict and the formation was wonderful, which was better than the American team. The Final Result Was a Difference of 13 Points</p>
<p>The overall situation was that our team was indeed better than the American team. The maximum difference in scores in the first half was 9 to 2. Our team only lagged behind twice with 9 to 11 and 12 to 13. The score in the first half was 16 to 15, and our team won by one point. In the second half, the United States only won the first time with 18 to 16. After that, the score became farther and farther apart. The maximum difference in the middle was 31 to 21 and 38 to 25. The final result was still a difference of 13 points. Taking the Initiative Gave Us an Advantage</p>
<p>When the two teams took the field, our team launched a fierce attack, like a hungry tiger pouncing on a sheep, using excellent passing. Lu Zhongen scored first. In a short time, He Tong also hit a ball, taking the lead with 4 to 0. Seeing that the situation was not good, the American team quickly caught up. Shi Guiya hit a ball. After that, our team's momentum increased, He Tong added another ball, Lu Zhongen made a free throw, and then Wei Haiqing also got a ball. The score Luo took the lead with 9 to 2. Taking the initiative, the momentum was like a broken bamboo. The cheers of the audience were deafening. The Difference in the First Half Was Only One Point</p>
<p>The American team suffered this setback, so they suspended the time to reduce our team's vigor and plan countermeasures and offensive methods. When the battle started again, the ball situation turned smoothly, Shi Guiya and Smith hit each other, Xie Liwen also added one point by taking the opportunity of a free throw, and Smith added two more balls. The score jumped ahead and surpassed our team with 11 to 9. Therefore, the audience was panicked and cheered hard. The spirit of the athletes was invigorated, and the score suddenly took the lead again with 12 to 11. Unfortunately, it was like a flash in the pan. Shi Guiya of the United States added two more points and the United States regained its advantage. The score was 30 to 12, but our team was not willing to fall behind. A Liang hit in front, and Li Baojun made contributions in the back. The score became 16 to 13. After holding for a short time, Hannes of the United States scored 16 to 15, and the first half ended here. China won with 16 to 15, with a difference of only one point. The American Team Lost Momentum and Fell Apart</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Smith made a free throw first, making it a tie with 16 points. Hannes made a distant throw and took over our team with 18 to 16. It didn't take long for our team's momentum to increase again. Lu Zhong made 18 to 18. At this time, the American team was quite reluctant and it was not easy to suppress our team's vigor, so they suspended the time again, but it was in vain. Our team never slackened, Lu Zhongen dribbled the ball to the basket to shoot, Shi Guiya was unable to block it, and even fouled. In addition to Lu throwing a ball, he also made two consecutive free throws, adding four points at once. The American team was stimulated, and from then on, it fell apart. The momentum of our team became even stronger. Working Hard to Fight for the Championship</p>
<p>From then on, our team was all smooth sailing and invincible. The score gradually surpassed the American team, surpassing by 31 to 21, with a difference of more than 10 points. The American team continued to work hard to recover, and added 4 points to make it 32 to 25. This was the closest score in the second half. At this time, Shi Guiya of the United States was exhausted and had no chance to move, so he was replaced by Huo Shoupi, but there was still no improvement. Our team worked hard to fight, and when the game was over, they won by 13 points, with a score of 42 to 29. Referees: Zhang Guoxun and Smith.

<p>41 to 36</p>
<p>Also, Korea and Jews, the two teams were equally matched and the competition was extremely fierce. In the first half, Korea had a good situation, taking the lead with 22 to 14. In the second half, Korea was still able to maintain the situation, taking the lead all the way. However, in the last few minutes, the Jewish offensive was extremely strong and the scores were tied many times, and then finally defeated Korea with 41 to 36. Referee: Shao Ji. Women's Teams from Britain and the United States Win</p>
<p>In the International Basketball Women's Group, two groups started at 5:00 PM yesterday at the YMCA in the West: (1) Britain defeated China, 27 to 16, (2) The United States defeated the Federation, 47 to 24. The competition situation is as follows: (1) Britain Defeated China</p>
<p>Result: 27 to 16</p>
<p>The Chinese Team's Formation Was Disorganized</p>
<p>China's Defeat Was Due to a Lack of Guidance</p>
<p>China's defeat to Britain was surprising. The British team's skills were mediocre, as seen in the last game, but the talented Chinese team was greatly hit by it. To push its reasons, we have to say that the instructor had no knowledge. The inferiority of the formation was obvious and it was bound to fail. The forwards were Guo Xiaoping and Wu Peihua, and Chen Yingrui was assigned. As a result, Chen Yingrui was as if there was no one. The forwards were weak and the guards were tight. The instructor Qian Bu'en changed the forwards and moved the guards greatly. The change of the guards, this person came out and that person came out, three or four times in five minutes, which has never been heard of. It was a serious mistake to use the entire Southeast team to deal with the first half. It was even more incomprehensible to abandon Shao Jinying and Chen Xinyuan in the first half.</p>
<p>It Was Not Easy to Reverse After Losing Badly First</p>
<p>When the two armies came into contact, only British women were seen galloping on the Chinese field. Ma Sa made a free throw and opened the record with one point. The arrogance was high and the Chinese women could only sigh. Until the British army scored nine points, the Chinese team scored two points by Wu Peihua. The first quarter ended with 14 to 2. The Chinese team was far behind. Although Guo Xiaoping scored again in the second battle, they were still dejected. Therefore, Chen Xinyuan replaced Chen Yingrui, and Chen added two points in one fell swoop. In the first half, the British won with 17 to 6. In the second battle, the instructor Cai replaced Guo Wu with Xi Jun and Shao Jinying, and the formation suddenly opened up. Although they gradually caught up, after all, they lost too many points in the first half, and it was not easy to reverse. The result was 27 to 16. Referee: Smith. (2) The United States Defeated the Federation</p>
<p>A Ratio of 40 to 34</p>
<p>Both Teams Were Excellent</p>
<p>The battle between the United States and the Federation was a rare and wonderful performance in women's competition. The United States took advantage of its tall stature and was better than others. The Federation's formation was new, and the sisters of the West Women's Youth Center were assigned to the left and right forwards, and the center forward of Jie Hansheng. The configuration of the forward was excellent and unparalleled for a while. The two armies could not be distinguished, two points for each, and one ball for each. The accuracy of the throwing and the speed of the passing were amazing. The first quarter was 11 to 11. The Federation's tactics were slightly lacking in the second quarter, so the United States took the opportunity to win the first half with 25 to 18. In the second half, the Federation slightly changed its formation, and the Ma sisters switched forwards and guards. The momentum of the United States suddenly fell. The first quarter each scored eight points, making it 33 to 26. In the last quarter, the Federation followed closely, making it 36 to 34. People had the hope of victory, but the United States added four points, and the Federation gave up hope. The result was 40 to 34. This kind of result is only seen in women's basketball. Jie Hansheng's wonderful throwing must be praised. Referee: Shao Ji. Lehua Defeated West Police</p>
<p>The Result Was 2 to 0</p>
<p>The Lehua football team defeated the West Police team 2-0 at the China Baseball Stadium yesterday. This was a scene of the West's soccer league's A division. About 7,000 or 8,000 spectators attended the sunny spring day. It was a warm and sunny day. It was a time for the athletes to show off their skills, and it was also a great time for us to appreciate art. However, the performance of both sides was not excellent and the interest was reduced. This was a shortcoming. The Jiangsu Provincial Games Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhenjiang's Sports Are Unprecedentedly Lively and Grand</p>
<p>The Achievements of Various Sports Are Better Than Last Year</p>
<p>New Records in Long Jump and Shot Put Female High Jump Is Also Good</p>
<p>Suzhong Warehouse, Zhongnan Nantong Women's Normal School Rank at the Top Venue Arrangement The arrangement of the Jiangsu Provincial Games venue is very perfect. The main entrance faces south, and a memorial archway several feet high is newly built at the entrance. The exterior is painted with water cement and the top is blue. It stands upright, majestic and magnificent. Facing the venue is the command platform. Various prizes are arranged on the platform, dazzling. To the left of the platform is the military music pavilion, where the provincial government military band plays, the melodious and beautiful, extremely beautiful. The 200-meter diameter kneeling road is located at the entrance of the venue, and the Tutianchang Pagoda can be admired from the entire venue without missing anything. This kind of embellishment is really rare in previous conferences. There is a soccer field, three basketball courts, and volleyball and tennis are all available in the venue. If the ball courts are not enough, they will be held at Zhenjiang Middle School or the public sports venue. The surrounding stands are all newly built with a ladder, which is very suitable. The Jiangsu Provincial Consumer Cooperative is attached to the entrance, selling various supplies and food, which is very convenient. Opening Situation</p>
<p>Salute Report</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 15th, the weather cleared, the northwest wind was very strong, there was sand and dust in the sky, the venue was mobilized, and the athletes from various schools gathered in front of the command platform. Chairman Chen Hexuan (1) The whole body stood in awe and faced the center of the playground (2) The Boy Scouts raised the flag, (3) Bowed three times to the party national flag and the Prime Minister's portrait, (4) The chairman respectfully read the Prime Minister's will (5) The chairman's report briefly said that today's weather is very good. In addition to preparing to participate in the National Games, the purpose of our conference is to seek health. "Health" is a sound physical education. "Kang" is to have full physical fitness. The mission we bear is to build China, and it is the health of the majority of the people in the country that can succeed, not the victory of a few people. Therefore, in addition to swimming, all other sports in this sports meeting have everything, and a health competition has been added. It is to use scientific methods to test the degree of health of each participating player, and hope that we will pay attention to physical education at all times in the future. We live in this world of struggle. Without a healthy body, we will not be able to contribute to the society, the country and the world. I hope everyone will work together.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong's Speech Then Secretary Zhu Jingnong of the Education Department gave a speech, briefly saying that physical education is for health, and health is for fulfilling the obligations of the people to the country. Let's take a look at how the German youth are doing with physical education now. Germany used to be a country with military education. They are now restricted by the allied countries and cannot have military training opportunities. Their general youth usually pay special attention to personal physical training. Therefore, the result is not only not regressing compared to the past, but the national people's ability to endure hardship is several times more powerful than before. Not only men but also women can gather 50,000 young women in one place to practice gymnastics. Can our Chinese youth be as good as them? Not only are they not as good as Germany, but they are probably not as good as Japan. How dangerous is this, gentlemen? Today's participation in this conference, please do not forget the good example of German youth.</p>
<p>Zhang Daofan's Speech The second Zhang Daofan's speech, briefly said, everyone, are we not shouldering the Prime Minister's will to seek freedom and equality for China? Have we achieved it now? How can we defeat imperialism if we are physically weak and lifeless? Not only can we not carry a gun, but we can't even walk. How can we talk about being better than Germany? I want everyone to take the initiative to promote it, and don't start practicing when the conference is held. Jiangsu is a province with a developed culture. If we promote sports, we can maintain the permanent health of the culture.</p>
<p>Yang Xingfu's Speech The second Yang Xingfu's speech, briefly said, we want to talk about freedom and equality to the outside world, but we must first talk about our own body being free and equal. Our body is weaker than others, which means that our body cannot be equal. Now we have feet that cannot move and hands that cannot lift. We cannot command our own five senses, which means that our body is not free. Gentlemen, if you want freedom and equality for China, please first seek physical education to seek the freedom and equality of your own body. Not only that, but in addition to paying attention to physical education, there is also moral education and group education, which must be obtained in physical education. Where can the moral education and group education in physical education be found? It is found from the meaning of not being afraid of death. The physical education of a nation that is afraid of death is only superficial. Gentlemen, I don't hope that you will get the first, second or third place today. I want you to run to the end one by one. Don't give up halfway when you see that the first, second and third places are not available. If you see that the wind is not right, turn your head and go down. Sports are not for prizes. The purpose of sports is to be sports for the sake of sports and revolution for the sake of revolution.</p>
<p>He Yushu's Speech The second He Yushu's speech, briefly said, Jiangsu is a province with a developed culture, and now it is the province where the capital is located. If it can show its martial spirit, it will not be reduced to the discussion of being weak in literature. Therefore, not only can we not give up our unique history, but we must also promote and express the spirit of sports and be the advocate for all provinces. After the meeting was adjourned, the members walked around the field for a week, and then the sports began. Yesterday's Track and Field Games (1) Men's A and B Groups Preliminary Round</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>I recently read a news article in your newspaper's local news section titled "Shanghai Tea Workers' Union: Tea Worker Drunk and Gnaws on Finger." After investigation, our Standing Committee member Hong Zhonghe was injured yesterday while trying to mediate, and the incident is indeed true. However, it was not our Union that held the election for executive and supervisory congress at the Xingjiang Dunzhitang Hall, but rather the Xingjiang Dunzhitang Hall itself held the election for executive and supervisory committee members. However, Standing Committee member Hong Zhonghe was our Union's representative and attended the meeting. Now the report says that the Shanghai Tea Workers' Union held the election for the executive and supervisory committees at the Xingjiang Dunzhitang Hall, which is likely a misunderstanding. I hereby request a correction. Respectfully, Shanghai Tea Workers' Union, March 15th.</p>
