<h3 id="c5">法内閣又到 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>法國歷來之内閣雖易倒。然未有若此次夏丹内閣之速者。其實法國制度内。閣成立後。須經議院投一度信任票。方爲確定。此次之夏丹内閣。以投票失敗而倒。雖視爲未成立可也</p>
<p>吾人觀察此次法政黨之情勢。誠如路透電所言。純粹左黨内閣尙未至在國會内得到多數之時機。惟若欲調和其間。合左右兩派。而成一混合内閣恐亦難於永久。微論左派之急進社會各黨。未必遽肯合作。即能勉强合作。而主義不同。易起衝突。即以此次夏丹内閣論。社會黨向主減縮軍備以輕人民負担者。昨社會黨領袖白倫氏。旣發表一文。以表示反對泰狄歐軍縮之主張。今日夏氏宣布軍縮意見。雖言遵守前閣政策。然實含有不妨修改以企成功之意是亦反對泰狄歐之主張者。但其他各黨。則多反對夏閣主張。觀於今日投票結果。多表示歡迎泰狄歐。即右知兩派主義不同。斷無融洽餘地。况乎政黨每喜借問題以攻擊他黨作爲政爭工具。姑勿姑勿論此次夏閣之倒爲左右派政爭而倒抑爲海軍政策不同而倒。均有難於復合勢矣</p>
<p>至以影響於倫會方面。論因法内閣更動未定。擱代表出席之時間。使倫會不能速議其影響尙小若因更動内閣而并更動内閣軍縮之主張。則關係較大吾人姑觀其結果可也</p>

<p>少年印度今非昔比</p>
<p>已不復以劣弱自居</p>
<p>英失業問題嚴重</p>
<p>决不敢與之挑釁</p>
<p>云界社譯	Ｃ　Ｆ　Ａndrewsrn氏所寫論文云、六閱月來、印度政局、波瀾疊起、嗣印督宣布英政府擬以自治地位給予印度、並在倫敦召集會議、政潮乃告一段落、今日凡在印度有思想之人、皆覺英國因國内有失業問題、故其對印度殊感棘手、蓋印度係英之最良主顧、此際决不敢與之挑釁、試觀英對中國之新態度、其故不亦大可思哉、</p>
<p>少年印度已感覺其自已之新力量、不復自居於劣弱、國民黨中之少壯派、力主完全脫離英國、對於自治地位、尙不以甘受、彼等公認之領袖奈白魯氏、曾對報紙宣稱、「當英政府正向吾人宣戰之時而開會討論和平、乃無可想像之事、此種會議、必須以終止目下類於作戰的壓迫方法爲前提、英政府必須明白表示、以印度國民黨之要求爲基礎、出而媾和、不得徒事敷衍、甘地氏對英國之宣言、亦曰、「任何此等會議、必須如羅馬凱撒大帝之妻、一無可疑而後可、」但甘地願依某種條件接受在倫敦開會之提議、旋召集各政黨各敎派之領袖開大會、記者曾見其名單、確爲一種代表性質、左派代表有奈白魯氏、右派代表有史利聶伐沙氏、會議結果發表一全體通過之宣言於報紙、要求三事、（一）倫敦會議於和平空氣中行之、（二）舉行政治大赦、（三）參加倫敦會議之印度人民代表、須以印度國民大會之會員大多數充任、</p>
<p>以上三點、應無甚難行之處、然宣言中又請印督對於彼等對印督宣言意義之解釋、予以承認、以免誤會、據彼等之解釋、倫敦會議自身應將印度自治憲法之形式、提出於英國會、如是印督之宣言有兩層、一爲以自治地位爲目的、一爲舉行一種會議、而印度各派領袖、則認自治憲法即由會議决定之、迄今據印度種種報告、各派領袖對此解釋、未嘗發生異議、而英國各報則多未作此同一解釋、且在印度之談判已進行至起草自治憲法之一點、英國報紙亦皆猶昧昧焉、要之、一九二一年所頒行之改良憲法、缺點滋多、實不適用、英政府旣以負責政府給予印度、必須使其完全負責、若右手予之、左手取之、則非光明政治之手腕、亦且無益而有害也、</p>

<p>方本仁之近支親屬方丹池、去秋在滬逝世、所遺動産、約二十萬金、此外復有金葉金鎊等、亦値四千餘元、均不翼而飛、嗣經丹池之子達燦、查係父妾父鄧氏及僕役王達漢竊交其父鄧冠南、轉交與父執王樹棠、共同吞没、向索不還、後因扶柩回籍、無暇繼續追究、迨至去臘、鄧冠南突然由漢赴滬、達燦恐彼來申、或爲提取銀行存欵、故隨之來、未幾其女鄧氏、亦由漢至滬、達燦遂延詹紀鳳律師向臨時法院控告鄧氏父女及兩王偷竊遺産、並爲預防鄧冠南逃避起見、乃與鄧同寓虹口大旅社、詎鄧氏竟向虹口捕房報告方達燦有綁票行爲、經捕頭派探將方逮捕、迨經說明原委、已無端被覊數小時、故方又委其代理律師詹紀鳳、加控鄧氏父女揑詞誣告、而鄧冠南亦由代理律師具狀、控方達燦及方之五叔方鳳池、與胡漢卿·周善邦、等私自監禁妨害自由等情、業已一度傳審、</p>
<h3 id="c144">方達燦所控竊盜案 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>不能常入病室　昨日午後、届續訊之期、被告王樹棠自行投案、並延江一平律師辯護、其餘被告中之王達漢·胡漢卿·周善邦·則皆未到、旋羅人驥推事升座第十四法庭、宣告兩造互控之案、共計三起、應先審方達燦所控之竊盜案、當據自訴人方達燦訴稱、我父患病以後、鄧金離間我父子感情、我遂不能常入病室、僅由鄧氏及王達漢在我父側、</p>
<p>偷竊金鎊金葉　去年七月二十一日至八月初三日、父病危殆之際、彼等遂將鐵箱内金鎊金葉與皮包内一切存摺簿據偷竊、該項金器、由鄧氏携至樓下其父鄧冠南室、交由冠南携往鮑靈峯家、交與王樹棠取去、</p>
<p>生前三十餘萬　繼據方鳳池證稱、胞兄逝世時、我在漢口得信、於八月初六日到滬、我兄弟七人、迄未分析家産、係屬共有、由丹池管理、各項活期定期存欵、約二十餘萬、連不動産不下三十餘萬、</p>
<p>死後僅數百金　乃丹池故世後、則僅有存摺四扣、存欸祇三四百元、餘皆烏有、丹池病時、取用欵項、多由鄧氏·王達漢·經手、</p>
<p>存欵殊難調查　我到滬得悉家無現欵、而喪事需資、擬取金鎊金葉、遂開鐵箱、詎已不見、詢係鄧氏取去、及將烟葉提單、挽王樹棠抵押、一面調查存欵、奈我兄平日多係用他種名義存儲、故難調查云云、</p>
<p>保管金鎊金葉　又由證人鮑靈峯之姪鮑振鵬證稱、去年八月初五日午後一時王樹棠先來我家、旋鄧冠南亦來、將金器交王、託其保管、當經檢點、計金鎊八十枚、金葉一包、約有十兩、此係目覩、餘無他物云云、</p>
<p>金鎊押棺材店　質之被告王樹棠、供與丹池爲友、彼病故之日、其家眷請我前去爲之代購衣棺、次日、鄧將金鎊八十八枚及金葉携至鮑家、託我保管、至是月十一日、因購棺之欵四百五十五元未付、我權將金鎊向出售棺材之南市新碼頭聚豐木行暫押、至十二日、烟葉押欵做成、仍將金鎊取回、交還鄧氏父女、其金葉亦同送還、至該金器究係丹池贈與鄧氏、柳鄧氏私取、則非我所知、</p>
<p>金鎊事可調查　詹律師隨即提出各種字據賬單購棺發票、證明王樹棠所供不能憑信、並稱該項金鎊金葉、實無向聚豐暫抵之事、儘可調查云云、</p>
<p>丈夫給我金鎊又據鄧氏供、金器係丈夫於去年五六月間所給、因其前將我之金飾變賣、我與爭吵、故以金鎊等給我、及丈夫逝世、而六叔鶴池、欲索該項金器、達燦且欲搜索、故我與父送往鮑家、託王保管、嗣王仍將原物交還、鄧冠南對金器一節、所供與其女略同、</p>
<p>卡片病中親筆惟方鳳池以鄧氏等供伊兄變賣該氏之首飾數語、認爲完全不確、提出證據、證明彼時其家活期存欵甚多、其兄斷無變賣首飾之舉、並提出卡片一張、謂卡片上係丹池病中親筆、所寫各處存欵之數共有六萬餘金、又稱鄧氏前次供金鎊三十六枚、而今則云八十枚、究竟若干、請求查究、</p>

<p>父女控我綁票次訊方達燦控鄧氏父女誣告案、由方訴稱、二月七日、鄧氏投虹口捕房控我綁票、致被中西包探前來逮捕、並加刑具、初拘至虹口捕房、旋解匯司捕房、經我說明、才得釋放、鄧氏於未報捕之前、曾至虹口大旅社、與其父會面、故實係父女串同也、</p>
<p>捕房包探證明又由虹口捕房十七號包探到案證稱、當時鄧氏係與其代表律同投房捕房報告後、我詢該律師、謂所控係私自監禁、遂往將方逮捕、當時未聞綁票之語、</p>
<p>報捕綁票問題質之鄧氏供、伊投捕房、係指控達燦將我父私自監禁、且事前從未與父相商、而鄧冠南則稱我女來申、係我函召、但其報捕之舉、我初未預聞、時詹律師以鄧氏報捕、確曾言綁票、請調查該捕房紀錄、庭上准之、</p>
<h3 id="c146">鄧冠南控妨害自由案 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>到滬監視行動末訊鄧冠南所控妨害自由案、據鄧述到滬後、被方氏叔姪及胡漢卿·周善邦·搜查行李、取去盤費及監視行動等情、而兩方對彼所控、槪以毫非事實、逐層答之、</p>

<p>巡捕竟棄職潛逃繼據甘律師稱自拘捕各被告後、均覊押捕房、而有一八三一號華捕、代被告陳德山私通信息、經捕頭察悉、即往陳家搜查、抄出當票數紙、現該捕已棄職潛逃云云、</p>
<p>顔案牽涉唐文藻又據陸長慶供認、因程德泉之介紹、代薦唐文藻赴馮姓（即程克明）處爲開車、不知綁票之事、捕房甘律師又稱、去年顔子章被綁後、捕房已獲案犯李阿福等兩名、供出開車者爲唐文藻、後捕房曾發出通緝單飭拿、迨唐逮捕、彼在捕房亦承認分得洋一千五百元、現有證人到案、惟顔子章今日已赴香港、不能到庭、</p>

<p>你的愛人設使動怒時。你切勿和伊談話。因爲你們這時談話。雙方的感情。最容易破裂的。</p>
<p>女子愛美性。比較男子較爲濃厚。其實男子愛美的心理。還要超過女子。</p>
<p>情塲上最可怕的女子。是抱浪漫主義的婦女。因爲伊們是最歡喜玩弄男性的。</p>
<p>離婚的事情。雖然是夫婦雙方同意。其實一百件離婚案中。有若干件夫方或妻方。是出於被動的。</p>
<p>牢獄中的生活。顧名譽與顧道德的人們。是嘗試不到的。</p>

<p>— 玉簫</p>
<p>發現藏金之事。報章恒見之。類多不實不盡。今吾所記。則殊信而有徵。蓋談者乃親目所覩也。其事距今猶未遠。發生於湖州之衣裳街。初。自訓政開始。各大名城。莫不從事於市政之建設。湖州亦然。特將城内外街道。加以修築。並一律放寬以利行人。因而街面商肆及住宅。什九須拆讓若干尺。築路工人。無慮數百。邪許之聲大作。是役也。歌頌者有之。嗟怨者有之。此爲地方大政。無與於本題。可母多贅。當記其發現藏金之異。衣裳街有一布肆曰正豐者。其店面亦在讓進之列。即在正豐店面故址。某工人舉鋤下掘。忽爲一硬物所硬。檢視之乃一泥團。去其外垢。則燦然現黄金色。元寳也。不禁大喜欲狂。其他工人皆聞聲麕集。彼此傳觀。果屬赤金元寳。以爲决不止一個。更就其處發之。竟陸續掘出銀質者十六個。又金質者十二個。均重數十兩。其上並刻有「元豐」字樣。不稔何年遺物。工人輩驟獲此意外横財。羣思佔有。互相攘奪不止。幾釀大禍。幸有魯仲連出而調停。按名支配。始各欣然分享了事。按藏金之發現似可異而實不足奇。蓋必有人埋藏於先。而後有人發現。非爲無中生有也。唯迷信家或視爲財神所賜。因此而媚神愈至。事之益虔。焦思竭慮。冀有所獲者。實則歷史上屢生變亂。富室第每於避難之前。藏埋財貨。眞所謂無地蔑有。發現之機會。要亦可遇而不可求耳。以湖州衣裳街發街現金銀元寳後。同時在别街築路之工人。頓生妄想。故連類釋之。</p>

<p>— 夢綺</p>
<p>俗語說得好。「在家千日好。出門一時難。」的確。出門眞不是件容易事。下面一件事。是我親身經歷的。寫來也許可以作未上當諸君的殷鑑。</p>
<p>當長江輪到上海的時候。我們忙着下船。因爲同行的有幾個人。所以約好將行李箱籠。放在一起。到了碼頭忽然間闖進一個某客棧的接客的。他也不問人同意不同意。拿了東西便跑。手裏給了一個銅牌。說憑此牌到旅館裏取東西吧。東西旣然被他拿去。也没有方法。祇好聽他。他又叫我們坐了一輛馬車。直到那一家客。</p>
<p>棧。我們爲要行李。也祇得任其擺佈。到了旅館。看看被難同志。却也不少。曉得這筆竹槓。敲下來一定不少的。有一位帶了兩件東西。竟要十二塊。後來總算五元了結。我們看看不好。而且出錢還不打緊。東西却慢慢不來。急得像熱鍋上的螞蟻。但已經做了砧上肉。祇好一任宰割了。後來一位朋友。覺得太豈有此理。偷偷地出外叫到兩位巡捕。由巡捕一一問明。將價錢大形减削。客棧中一見巡捕。心却慌了。東西也來了。所開的價錢也低些了。但是嘴裏却大駡不已。幾乎要動武。結果我們也出了五塊錢。纔算逃出虎口。　　因此我覺得凡是乘江輪到上海的。到岸時。千萬不可把門開了。門一開。弊竇就來了。最好等一會。待人散散。然後從容出去。不然。出了寃枉錢。還要被人笑呢。</p>
<h3 id="c188">西泠書畫社春季雅集參觀記 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 王梅璩自杭州寄</p>
<p>書畫爲吾國國粹。自歐風東漸。字仿蟹行。畫重水彩及鉛筆油繪。而篆。隸行楷。寫生設色之舊模範。或幾乎息矣。杭州有西泠書畫社之組織。吾女藴華。近爲環境所迫。暫就母居。撫兒之暇。得母命。從師學書畫。半年以來。所學篆體及士女花卉等作品。大致楚楚。得入該社爲社員。二月十六日爲該社第七届春季雅集之期。先二日承社中耆舊王潛樓陸藹堂兩先生折柬邀余夫婦前往參觀。婦病初起。不可以風。余乃獨往參觀所得。略誌於後。</p>
<p>社之歷年及社址是社經杭之耆宿名流。悉心組織今已七年。社址暫設直箭道巷十九號。參觀之際。社友申石伽先生告余曰。每年春季。必將社員作品陳設展覽一次。現幸社員日益增多。社中領袖。方將積極以謀擴大之發展。即社址亦思遷地爲良也。</p>
<p>是日雅集之盛况是日以上午九時開幕。下午四時聚餐攝影而散。男女社員一百四十餘人。到者六十餘人。以社中陳列塲所稍隘。社員書畫各件。未能一一懸掛。而即席書畫合作者如王潛樓陸藹堂申石伽朱景廬胡亞光吳劍華等。及女社友何浣薇范石厂方淑卿傳磊靑諸女士。書備四體。畫宗前賢。對客揮灑。始皆謙遜。及其奏技。實各當仁不讓。吾女藴華亦效步趨於其間。並携其所書篆字立幅。及工筆七子圖。頗爲社中師友所許。參觀者亦無貶辭。又承師命。足成申石伽所題梅谿山水合作之柳梢靑詞下半闋。諸女士亦均有可誦可讀之作。</p>
<p>聚餐之興會是日男女社友曁來賓蹌濟一堂。假座社友家中之廣厦。分席酬酢。男女賓及社友各以類從。並不雜坐。來賓頌美。潛樓藹堂石伽均答以謙辭。藹堂曾有一日之雅。文章政事。索所服膺。潛樓初次識荆。敝屣尊榮。怡情書畫。山水尤精。石伽英年銳進。出入於米顚摩詰間。與傳磊靑女士之書法。胡亞光先生之西畫。皆未易才也。而全體社員又皆無懈可擊。吾女附庸風雅。亦云幸矣。</p>
<p>來函頃讀本刊載有杭州市新聞一則。指謂諸曁西鄉之十三都黄家湖村相近鷄冠山。有巨虎一隻。被村民黄百有等登山捕獵。運杭求售。旋爲大井巷胡慶餘堂出價一千三百元買去等詞。循之餘。以事實歧異。有失眞相。鄙人世居諸曁縣屬定靑村。素恃狩獵爲業。茲於本年廢曆正月初九日。困距離本村天洞山麓。發現巨虎足跡。究諸虎體碩大無比。兇猛異常。似非數人得能就捕。乃邀約同業十五人。分頭跟踪追獵。始於十一日黎明冒險捕獲。嗣經運至杭州。售於望仙橋直街葉種德堂藥號。計得實價洋三百五十元。回里公同平均分配利益。不意日昨因貴報誤載該虎脫售價値。計洋一千三百元。以道遠言略。卒至以誤傳誤。而同獵者咸懷疑竇。羣起究詰。認定經售人見利頓忘患難之義。侵蝕代價以肥已。雖經百般解釋。終難得當事者之諒解。第以夙仰貴報記載素崇翔實。見聞尤重實際。用特耑函聲叙詳情。擬請迅予更正。俾明眞相。冀免糾紛。無任感盼。手此即頌大一筆先生惠鑒鄙人蔣鼎文趙阿廷同殷。二月二十一日。</p>

<p>春節以來。平中劇界風氣之一變。實行男女合演。上座極佳。以故各名伶紛紛邀約坤伶合作。如楊小樓言菊朋與新秋之在開明戲院。郝壽臣吳鐵庵與章過雲之在華樂園。即久未獻身紅氍毹上之余勝蓀。亦與賀舜琴出演於三慶園。由滬返平之馬連良。又擬約杜麗雲。尙小雲亦改弦易轍。正從事物色一坤伶出演云。　　各班旣開男女合演之先例。而城内東安市塲之吉祥園。首先打破男女分座之新紀錄。按平中舊慣。左男右女。絶不淆雜。今得批准男女合座。大得其所。於是吉祥園日夜均告滿座。</p>
<p>上燈後一夕。開明戲院楊小樓之安天會、言菊朋新艶秋之探母回今。擁擠不堪。八時客滿。惟新艶秋於台上帶令時。致將令箭遺忘。旋又一轉身喊檢塲者。遂飽受一滿斱塲倒好。聞新艶秋下塲後嚶啜泣不止。平中顧曲。每多苛求。其實區區小疵。無關大體。責者不覺。而受者難堪。鬻藝歌塲。良非易易。</p>
<p>雪艶琴學今是坤伶中之最紅人物。大家閨閣。多所往還。連日出演於吉祥。上座以女客佔十分之六。昨有某局長之七姨太。特煩演花田錯一劇。獨定廂十餘。遍請其姊妹行。雪艶琴之魔力亦不弱矣。</p>

<p>— 吳孝侯</p>
<p>者厠身國自治界並社會敎育事業十數載。於本年八月中遊。此行任務。專以考察日本各大市市政兼社會敎育爲目的。然以忝爲江蘇全省報界聯合會監委之一。且受本報　理史量才先生之函訂爲駐日特約通訊專員。除參觀日之市政並社敎各機關外。兼及報社學校並歷史風景名勝各處所。茲以爲有統糸之糺載起見。爰將赴日考察親往之長崎。東京。横濱。名古屋。西京。大阪。神户。各大市市政。並社敎機關參觀所得爲綱。兼及報社學校並歴史風景名勝等處所。以考察地之先後。順序紀載。俾有條不紊。一覽了然。藉他山之之石。供國内觀摩。倘亦閱者。</p>
<p>所樂聞歟。</p>
<p>（一）起行前回顧記者厠身國内自治界並社會敎育事業十數載。民十一之秋。曾由江蘇省署特派赴山西考察自治行政。旅晉兩月。周歷三道十一縣。歸以考察所得。編著山西自治行政實察記。書經再版行世。未敢自封。早擬出國考察市政。以期集思廣益。原定作歐美之行。適以西遊費鉅。一時不易籌集。嗣晤本報總理史量才先生。荷示以東鄰日本。步武歐美有年。自强不息。曷不先往觀摩。途近費省。較易實現云云。爰摒擋一切。决志東遊。當荷内政部趙前部長給文成行。並荷外交部亞洲司長周師二爲函介吾華駐日汪袞甫公使指助一切。爰於八月中乘上海丸東渡同行有前上海新華藝術大學畢業之杜懷榮女士。並日本帝國大學文學士毛秋白君二人。上海丸例定晨九時起椗。七時登輪。是日昧爽五時即起。六時趨車赴輪埠。來客甚少。一肩行李。蕭然遠征。鳥聲送客。草色牽裾。迨起椗出口。則大雨忽來。雲水蒼茫。扁舟行幸無風浪。習晨上午十二時即抵長崎。下椗後。詢悉輪於下午五時開行。舟行一日夕。悶坐良苦。旣有五小時之空間。光陰竇實貴。乃偕杜女士上岸午餐後。謁晤吾華駐長崎林哲卿領事。當荷特倩領館主事孫理甫偕赴長崎各市政并社敎機關參觀。下午四時三十分偕林主事回輪。林領事并來輪埠相送。握别依依間。汽笛一聲。遂鼓輪向神户前進矣。</p>
<p>（二）長崎之考察。</p>
<p>（甲）市政自長崎領館偕孫主事并杜女士赴長崎市役所。（即市政廳）適市長富永氏。因公外出。由副市長玉置省吾氏接見。詢悉日本各市市長。均爲民選制。另設市議會。以議决市範圍内之事件。議員亦由民選。與吾華現行之各特别市普通市市長。係行政任命。並無市議會之市制不同。惟各市役所下。亦分設敎育。土木。社會。財政等局。受市所管轄。處理市區内本管之事務。則與吾華市下之各局。大致相同。至市長雖爲民選。而在縣則受縣知事之監督。在府則受府知事之監督。（日本行政組織。有東京。西京。大阪。二府。另長崎兵庫縣等四十三縣。府設府知事。縣設縣知事。另北海道。及樺太廳。各設長廳長一人。台灣。朝鮮。及關東旅大。三領域。則各設總督一人。南洋屬地。則有國際聯盟巴黎和會所委任統治一人。）與吾華市縣或特市與省平行者有别。該市現計户數有三萬九千五百零三户。人口有二十四萬八查百四十七人。歲入金。二百五十八萬四千一百五十六元。歲出金經常部。一百四十萬二千八百三十元。臨時部一百十八萬一千三百二十六元。合計如歲入之數。歲出門内。分水道費。港灣費。住宅費。造林基本財産。敎育基金。同胞救濟基金。町有金。煤災損害塡補并市債償蓄積金。公會堂建設基金。等九項。全市華僑。約有一千二百人。以商工業爲多。間有爲僧侶者。斯地逼近吾國。爲由華來日之第一埠。在該國且列爲要塞之一。市衢整潔。房屋新建築者尙少。仍多日之舊式矮屋。因長崎屬普通市。不能與東京。横濱。名古屋。西京。大阪。神户。六大嫓美也。</p>

<h3 id="c210">最近的荷蘭文壇荷蘭女小說家底新著 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 曼如</p>
<p>從古以來、文學就是生活的鏡子、這是大家都公認的、但是文學不僅照出了生活、而且多少能夠影響生活、所以我們可以接着說、生活影響文學、文學也影響生活在現代尤其如此、我們如果要知道某國民生活狀况、民族心理、最好的辦法就是去看那一國底文藝作品、我們從這種作品中所得到的認識、往往會比游歷一趟所得到的見聞來得眞確扼要、</p>
<p>因爲荷蘭近來所出的書籍一大半都是講到性的問題、婚姻的失敗、離婚、自由戀愛的試騐等等、所以我們可以結論說、在荷蘭、現在也起了這樣的疑問—現存的婚姻律法是否適當的呢、男子與女子是否眞是一夫一妻制的動物呢、這樣的疑問在最近的荷蘭小說中是很多的、而且有的還加以解答、由此可以看出、性愛與婚姻現在正是荷蘭人最注意的問題呢、</p>
<p>荷蘭雖然不是一個大國、而且作家並不多、但是女作家却很不少、尤其是在小說方面、女作家底成績極好、最近、有四位女作家發表了四部長篇創作、這確是近來荷蘭文壇上一件很値得注意的事情、内中有三篇都是以戀愛問題婚姻問題家庭問題爲叙述的焦點的、從這三篇我們可以看出荷蘭的女性對於這些問題的態度·意見·辦法等等、我們現在就來談談這四部小說底内容、</p>
<p>第一位女小說家是安麥古勒夫人）Ｖan　Ammers　Kuller)她在她最近的作品、「丹塔勒司」（Ｔantalus）裏、講到一對有了三個孩子而且看似幸福的夫婦底故事、這部小說之所以題名「丹塔勒司」者、是因爲那個丈夫很像希臘神話裏的丹塔勒司、按丹塔勒司本是宙斯之子、住在天宮、後來因爲驕狂過度、觸怒衆神、打入地獄、浸在糊中、口渴要喝水則水忽然淺了、肚饑要採食頭上的果子、則果子忽然升高、所以他永遠是看着可望而不可即的東西、永遠是饑渴着、我們的這位男主人翁、亦就是這樣的一個人物、他的妻雖然是美柔忠實、他却總覺得不滿足、總覺得很饑渴、不幸他又徧徧像那個倒霉的丹塔勒司、看見水想喝時、水却淺退了、看見果子想吃時、果子却避開了、這樣的痛苦、他忍受了好久、但始終不死心、因此、當後來他又碰到了好吃的果子、而且這果子自已塞到他嘴裏要他吃、這時他就趕快呑吃了、却不料吃的是壤果子、那個少婦是不懹好意來引誘他的、於是這年已四十頭髮都有點灰白的男子把自已弄成了一個笑柄、而且、除了肉體上的滿足以外、他是深深地感到失望了、</p>
<p>這是一部優美的小說、尤其是因爲她描寫妻底悲哀和絶望、描寫得很好、而且没有太過和不足的弊病、這部小說雖然不及她的傑作「反叛的一代人」（ＴhejRabelGenration)、但是能像她那部傑　那　　　裏　出現代人底　念一生活底狀　、以及被慾望所引起的不幸等等、沉靜地客觀地寫了出來、却並不說出補救的方法或是解决的辦法、</p>
<p>「丹塔勒司」的故事只是引起了一個問題—夫對於妻做了不正當的事情以後、他們還是離婚呢還是繼續同居、作者並没有給我們一個解答一但「女兒們」却不然了、它不但寫出離婚、而且實獻了一個解决的辦法、「女兒們」是特及特（Carl　Van　Lidth　Jeude)著的、她所注意的不是離婚問題、而是離婚對於子女的悲慘的結果、當父母們自行其是、隨意離合的時候、子女們底幸福被摧殘了、他們將來所要受到的不幸、做父母的人是没有顧及的、在作者看來、這是一種很慘痛的事情、所以她把這樣的情狀做中心、寫出了一部正經實在的小說、而且在小說之中、她還對於這問題、給了一個解答、</p>
<p>故事中的一對夫婦是離婚了的、他們的女兒們也就分居了、一個跟着父親、享受着繼續求學的絶對自由、一個跟着母親和外祖母、過着家居的生活、然而她的母親是致力於慈善事業和社會事業的、所以不大去管敎她、因此她是過着自由自在的生活的、像那種離了婚的女人、個個都是自由的、經濟獨立的、可是個個都找不到幸福、外祖母冷眼旁觀、注視這一班新女子、和她們底新性格、她覺得這晚一輩人底生活速度是快些了、行動是自由些了、觀念是進步些了、可是、…她覺得、骨子裏一切都還是一樣、没有什麽改變、</p>
<p>一個女兒出嫁了生了孩子、但是忽然發現她的丈夫在跟一個少女調情、她覺得這是不可容忍的、就决定和他分離、另一個女兒呢、後來却愛上了一位有婦之夫、年紀比她大二十歲、並且早已有了孩子、但是他情願和他和妻離婚來娶她、到這裏、故事底情節錯綜起來了、這時又有兩批的小孩子要被逐出家庭了、但是忽然來了一個大轉變、兩女兒之中、有一個突然明白了這件將要發生的事情、於是這兩個姊妹一同到外國去、在淸新的山頂空氣中、她們把這個問題徹底地談了一談、她們的結論是、做父母的人不可以太自私自利、應該爲兒女着想、所以爲兒女而犧牲的事情是不妨做做的、她們想出解决辦法之後就回去了、一個仍舊去跟丈夫和好、竭力去寬恕他、挽回他的愛情一個呢、拒絶了她的情人、</p>
<p>這個辦法當然就是作者給我們的答案、但是這個答案對麽、這是很難說的、不過、各個國度底情形不同、各個時代底情形不同、各個人底情形不同、宜於此者往往不宜於彼、如果碰到有這種問題的時候、最好的辦法當然是、各人去造出各人底答案、作者所說只是作者底答案而已、</p>
<p>梵·白羅根（Calry　Van　Bruggen）在「夏娃」裏說到一個名叫夏娃的女人的故事、夏娃經歷過人生所能發生的一切、但她對於人生總還是覺得莫明其妙、她始終不了解人生、在少女的時候、她覺得她和别的少女們不同、然而她又不敢與人立異、她愛美、愛家庭、尤其是愛她那攣生兄弟、但是她常常在她自已的夢幻世界裏過生活、怕接觸到成人底秘密、到了調情和性的覺醒的時期、她是更加的莫名其妙了、當一個少年在夜間口裏吹着小調要她出去時、她不情願聽、然而她却走出去會他、當他在一個黑暗的小園裏、和她接吻的時候、她又忽然充滿了狂喜、但當他粗莽地接觸她時、她却逃走了、不過、她現在明白了、少女們爲什麽都愛到黑暗的花園裏去、這種事情是對的呢、還是錯的呢、她狂熱地匆匆忙忙讀了好些書、想要從書中發現、戀愛底另一方面到底是什麽、於是她找到梵依譚（FrederikVan　Eeden)荷蘭最偉大的詩與散文作家之一）底解答、梵依譚說、</p>
<p>祇有那在最高的喜悅之中、比靈魂　　底其想一切都要强烈的、戀愛、　能使得肉慾美麗、如果没有那種最高的喜悅、一切的肉體的慾望都只是污穢的、卑鄙的、不道德的淫亂、這句話她奉爲金科玉律、以後她在生活裏、從來不忘記這句話、她結婚了、生了兒女、覺得她自已是一個母親、而不是一個妻子、所以當她的丈夫告訴她、說他愛了别一個女人的時候、她們像朋友地分離了、她旣有了兒女、她是非常滿意了、但是、她又莫明其妙起來、她不知道她在生活中所佔的地位是什麽、她是被排入「尊貴的中年太太們」之列、但她自已却覺得旣不是尊貴、也不是中年、也不是太太、於是、正當她相信自已有了兩個長大的孩子以後、是從此結束了一切荒唐的事情的時候、她忽然發現她自已是平生第一次、而且祇有這一次、眞眞愛上了一個男子、直到現在她才明白在戀愛之中是没有恐懼和羞慚的餘地的、在戀愛中是祇有熱情和勇敢的、直到現在她才明白梵依譚底理論是誤謬的理論、</p>
<p>這確是一部非常的作品、而且和作者以前的作品不同、作者以前的作品往往是細緻而帶哲學氣味的、但「夏娃」却是在一時的奮發中寫成的、没有風格的散文、不過雖然如此、這部小說却是很活躍很流暢、並且它分析一個女人底心理分析得很精妙、又很誠摰、再則這部小說又可以說是這位女小說家底自傳、她本是荷蘭底「現代少女」的先鋒、剪「童化」、不戴帽子在街上走路、她是頭一個、那些知道她的過去生活的人、在這部小說裏是不難找出她本人底踪跡的、</p>
<p>以上這三部部是以婚姻與戀愛爲中心的、但是梵巴倫（Mathile　A　Van　BＪＬaen)底「健忘島」却和這三部全然不同了、這是荷蘭前次懸賞募集的小說中的得獎之作、在二百多部不署名送入的作品之中、這部小說奪了第一、可是、不幸得很、它的作者在懸賞未發表以前就去世了、還是個年輕的女作家呢、</p>
<p>這是一部寫戰後生活的小說、顯然是因爲作者目睹了許多戰後慘狀而寫的、書中大略說一個醫生在英屬印度得到一種秘藥、服之服使人失去記憶、這善良的醫生因爲有許多人忘不掉過去的悲劇而心靈受盡苦痛、所以想用此藥使他們忘却一切、他後來居然找到好些的這種苦人兒、（書中說出他們各人底故事）帶他們到一個荒島上、大家同時喝下這種藥汁、藥力果然有效他們忘盡了過去的一切、不再記得他們的悲哀、那末、他們以後的生活應當是快樂幸福的了、但是並不、他們的思想力還存在、他們逐漸的詫異起來、急於要明白他們是從那兒來的、後來他們知道他們是吃過一種藥了、於是大家覺得、眞實即使可怕、總比暗中摸索茫無所知好得多、因此他們强迫那醫生給他們吃些解藥、使他們回復原狀、醫生對付他們不了、幸虧他有解藥、就給他們吃了解樂、這些人從此以後就又墮入悲哀之海了、</p>
<p>這部小說立意是很新頴的、只可惜技巧差些、風格也嫌枯燥拙笨、而且這藥底能力顯出破綻、不容易引起讀者底相信、這是作者才力不足之處、雖然全書頗有農厚的時代性、</p>

<p>— 日葵</p>
<p>爲少男少女鳴不平</p>
<p>我已經活過了十六歲了、我要老了、我已經活過了兩個最美麗的年齡了、在無論那一個人的生活史上、所謂靑春的妙齡、祇有十五歲與十六歲這兩個年紀吓、</p>
<p>啊、爲什麽社會上一般做父母師長的、都要把正届妙齡時代的少男少女、錮鎖起來、關閉在匣子般的世界裏呢、爲什麽要强逼他們遠離自然界、遠離森林、遠離幸福呢、爲什麽要嚴禁他們與異性的靑年來往交際呢、</p>
<p>爲什麽只敎　他們以沉悶枯燥的無用課程、而不把有興味的與有益處的文學與藝術、或關於生理上　健的常識、來啓示一般少男少女呢、</p>
<p>爲什麽只替他們娓娓不倦地說明數學的方式、哲學的原理、對於那一去不復回的靑春有密切關係的戀愛方式、婚姻原理、爲什麽反而一字不提呢、</p>
<p>你們以爲靑春的時代不足珍愛、以爲靑春過去了會再回來的嗎、以爲人類可以有兩次的十六歲嗎、請你讀下面這兩句討吧、</p>
<p>十五歲、是女人脫離孩子的年齡、脫離了造化者的手、多麽地天眞瑩潔、</p>
<p>請問你讀了有什麽感想、你們不是要問心自愧嗎、啊、你們的妙齡、已經给你們的執法者蹂躪盡了、你們現在雖深悔、或者怨艾、但是光陰一去不復回、已經來不及了、</p>
<p>爲什麽要用性别來隔離靑年們呢、爲什麽要禁阻他們社交呢、最後我要問你們、爲什麽一定要先使他們結了婚、才後肯放任少男去結交少女、或使少女結交少男呢、</p>
<p>啊、世界是如此美麗、人類是如此聰敏、造化者把少男少女厮混在一起、會呌他們從朝到夜、從夜到朝、互相戀愛、互相喜悅、他們倆中一方的一個注視、就能使對方得到幸福、只消一束頭髮、就能保存到十年之久、只消一個接吻、就貢獻了全部的生命、這眞是多麽佳妙、多麽美麗、多麽香艶的甜夢吓、這好像是有類在靑春時代所可享受的種特殊權利吓、</p>
<p>可是、社會人士土偏要從中破壞、說什麽「這些孩子們的戀愛、不能維持長久的、應該需要矯正他們萬萬不可放縱他們戀愛下去、」於是人家就把他們隔離起來、把他或她獨人關閉在一間凄凉的臥室或　房裏面、用盡方法來摧殘他們倆的靑春、男的叫他讀書、女的呌她　告、人家給少女們所讀的書本都是無關購　緊要的修身敎科書類、一直要等到她嫁了丈夫以後、才對她說、「從此以後、你可以隨便看什麽了、」那麽伊就自然而然也揀小說看了、伊最喜歡看的、是左拉與莫柏桑的作品、</p>
<p>天吓、假使我能夠和一個與我年歲相同的少女共同生活、有一個可踪崇拜的少女、一個情人、我眞是多麽有幸福吓、我甘心情願終生抱住她的頸項、我的頭倚在她的胸懷、我的嘴唇貼在她的頣頰、她的頭髮掩没我的眼睛、……</p>
<p>啊、女人、女人、　　我已經十七歲了、没有嘗過一個愛情的接吻、没有聽過一句情話、没有看過一個微笑、啊、我要燃燒起來了、我要燃燒起來了、</p>
<p>啊、每到黄昏、我一個人睡在床上、輾側不能安眠、我每次幻想我身伴睡着我夢中的戀愛少女、大家偎倚在一起、我愛撫她、她温慰我、毫不含惡邪的思想、啊、我只看見她的臉、她的頭髮、她的頭頸、其餘只是一團模糊的影子、我們大家情話綿綿、從她身上發出愛情的香味、我沈醉了、…我的床就變成了伊甸樂園、　　但是第二天朝上醒來、我只是一個人、比以前覺得更爲寂寞孤獨、心兒緊壓、舌頭乾燥、精神憂傷、啊、請你們不要笑我、你們中也一定有人與我同病的吓、　　啊、當我現在執筆寫這幾行字的時候、我的心神還没有安寗、或許有一位芳齡十六可愛的少女、也正在她的日記簿上、寫着與我同樣的煩悶與寂寞、她正渴想去尋一個像我這樣的一個少年男子、</p>
<p>也未可知……</p>
<p>咳、咳、我不能再寫下去了、我要哭了、</p>

<p>女太太們上小菜塲好像上戰塲一樣、小菜塲裏的菜販們、自然都是「嚴陣以待」的、爲了幾個銅子或者幾棵菜而起爭執、並不是希奇的事、伊們對於菜蔬的選擇、魚肉的揀剔、不厭繁瑣、不怕費事、眼睛鼻子手指頭、都是相互並用、以求最後的决定、至於價錢方面、那是比較物質還來得重要、顧客們互相探問價錢、竟和探聽軍情相仿、菜販向顧客討價、又像下戰書挑撥一樣、唇槍劍舌、閙個不了、等到東西買到手、精神也就差不多了、在上市的時候、没有一個小菜塲裏、不是閙得震天價響的、大約就是這個原因罷、</p>
<p>當你走過小菜塲的時候、你不妨放慢了脚步、作五分鐘的觀察、菜販們立在自已的攤後面、眼睛不是對顧客的籃裏望、就對着自已的筐裏看、嘴裏一面喊着、手裏還要聯貫的動着、這無非是推銷和招徠的意思罷了、譬如賣蘿蔔的菜販、他要常常翻動那菜筐、揀最大而肥白的蘿蔔、拿在手掌裏抛動着、魚灘上的魚、多半没有氣息的了、魚販們還要捲起了衣袖、伸手在水裏撈動、其實伸手到水裏一撈、至少可得兩三尾魚、他却在水桶裏兜上幾個圈子、然後緊緊握住了一尾魚、好像魚要跳走的樣子、出水的時候、還在那裏灑動着、這無非是示意顧客、魚是「活」的實則魚販嘴裏的「活龍活跳」意思就是「不弄不跳」罷哩、</p>
<p>至於買小菜的顧客們、他們臉上的氣色、就有種種不同樣的變化、譬如一位女太太要買竹筍、伊走過筍攤的時候、脚步就慢了、眼睛望在筍筐裏、打量了一會、纔後問價錢、這時她的臉色至少含有希望的表示、筍販所討價錢、如果過大或者奇賤、臉上的表示又要一變、價錢講妥了、就開始揀選、如果那一只筍的頭太長太老、照例要叫筍販削去、筍販因爲削去得多了、份量就要减少、不能多買錢、於是薄薄的削掉一角、女太太不同意、必定要他多削、這時候她的臉上就有重大的變化、因爲經濟的原理最簡單、人家便宜就是自已的吃虧、當然不能不愼重其事、最後一步便是給錢、銅子好像子彈、决没有虚發一顆的道理、</p>
<p>從早上六七點鐘直到上午九十點鐘、小菜塲裏的人、進進出出、忙個不停、鮮艶的顔色和腥臭的氣味、同時送到人面前來、那裏面有悅目的靑紅色、有自然的泥土氣、有可怕的血肉、有不和協的腥臊氣味、小菜塲的地上、十天總有十一天是潮濕的、裏面的空氣混濁的時候較了淸淨的時候多、灘菜的木架、陳菜的筐籮、都是小菜塲裏唯一的用器、當天還没有亮的時候、深黄的燈光下、就有許多的菜販、挑了他們的貨物、趕上菜場去、不多</p>
<p>一刻工夫、枯瘦骨立的架子上、就堆將了</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>不少的肉魚、以後越聚越多、木架子漸漸的隐藏起來了、　到吃過中飯、那一副一副的架子、仍舊露骨的向着人、</p>
<p>除了有菜市的時候、小菜場裏就一點没有趣味可言、冷淸淸的水門汀上、東一塊濕、西一塊乾、四周除了一根根柱子以外、毫没有裝飾、不過在早上就大不同了、一樣一樣的東西陳列起來、横擺的、竪放的、堆起的、平舖的、一種種都不同、樣、有的一個人管理七八隻筐籮、有的除了一堆葱薑以外、復有别的東西、至於附帶的賣賣買家用品的小販、也有借了小菜塲做大本營的、此外漕坊·南貸舖·火腿店等、更有不少開設在菜塲的附近、因了小菜塲而附帶産生的店舖、一時也說不盡、不過薦頭店的開設在小菜塲附近、間接之中實然含了直接的意思、想來决不是偶然的、</p>
<p>上海全市所有的小菜塲、計算起來、總不下三四十處、單就公共租界而論、就有虹口·新閘·愛而近路·匯山·東虹口·馬霍路·百頓路·北福建路·梧州路·松盤路·楊樹浦·等十三四處、菜攤的數目全數在四五千左右、工部局每年在各小菜塲所微徵收的攤捐、將近二十萬元、其數也其甚可觀了、普通的菜塲祇　平歴、規模較大的就有一層或者兩層樓房、大都爲水泥建築、南京路的鐵房子小菜塲、一部份賣「生的西菜」、虹口小菜塲裏面花色最多、告訴我們國際口味的地方不少、</p>
<p>小菜塲裏的情况、四時不同、菜疏魚肉也有時令的關係、小菜塲告訴吾們氣候的變換、同時也告訴吾們社會的情况、至於市政的良窳、居民的習常、小菜塲更時一個絶妙的「問訊處」哩、</p>

<p>Chiang's Earnest Final Counsel by Telegram</p>
<p>Yan's Respectful Telegram Criticizing the Third National Congress</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Yan Xishan again on the 26th, saying: "To my esteemed brother, Deputy Commander Yan Baichuan, with respect, I have received your confidential telegram. I have repeatedly explained in detail why you should withdraw your request to retire. The revolution is not yet complete, and it is not appropriate to withdraw into seclusion. The people's hearts are not settled, and I fear it will lead to war. It is deeply regrettable that you do not understand. I did not stop Huanzhang from going abroad. Because you insisted at the time that the reorganization would be completed in three months and that you would go together, I asked you to delay for a while. You said that Huanzhang is free in Shanxi, which is very good. Now, please allow Huanzhang to leave Shanxi and provide him with funds to go abroad. Your approval and prompt action will be appreciated. The implementation of reorganization, which is to reorganize the Second Group Army according to the original plan of the reorganization conference after Huanzhang goes abroad. The reorganization situation of the Third Group Army that you mentioned, if true, you said that it is difficult to implement unless all military power is returned to the Party. How can you contradict yourself to this point? Military power was originally given by the Party. If there is no act of betraying the Party, there is no need to feel ashamed. I have explained this in detail in my telegram. Regarding the All-Party Congress, Mr. Hui, as well as the three presidents of the Legislative, Supervisory, and Executive Yuans, have all explained clearly. Designating and selecting representatives was first created by the First National Congress. The Second National Congress also followed this example. The method for producing representatives for the Third National Congress was decided by the Standing Committee of the Second Central Executive Committee. The designated or selected representatives were also submitted to the Standing Committee and decided by public vote. You say that the Third National Congress is my Third National Congress, and that reorganization and suppression are no different from my personal orders. This is not only a serious slander against me personally, but also a serious slander against the Second Central Executive Committee and all Party members. The Party and the country are in crisis because of disgruntled and ambitious people who collude and stir up trouble, associate themselves with legal principles, and destroy Party discipline. Those who now oppose the method of producing representatives for the Third National Congress may have vigorously advocated designation and selection at the time. Unexpectedly, they are now using this to denigrate the Central Committee. You are picking up their leftovers. Moreover, you yourself were elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. If you were dissatisfied with designation and selection, why did you never object, nor did you refuse to be elected? Suddenly today, you are coercing me to retire with you, and you are speaking so grandly. Is this truly loving the Party and the country? No wonder commentators say that you have ulterior motives and are only using this as an excuse to incite chaos. In short, you do not understand the principles of the revolution, nor do you know the history of the Party. You first divide Party affairs and state affairs into two separate entities, wanting to overturn the Premier's advocacy of governing the country by the Party. In your mind, you do not know that there is a Party. Then, you hold the heterodox view of voting and deciding by all Party members, not hesitating to destroy the Party's general charter. In your mind, you still do not know that there is a Party. With someone who does not know that there is a Party, you are talking grandly about the Party's main body. I cannot but fear for the Party and the country. Most strangely, you say that the Premier's concession to Yuan was forced by power. You have no understanding of the Premier's public spirit and his fearless spirit. You think that even the Premier was forced to retreat by force, that force can still be used to force people. Then, you have not only lost the spirit of the revolution, but also slander the Premier's revolutionary personality. Those who once persuaded Yuan to advance are now probably trying to take Yuan's place and force people with force. If so, why talk about revolution? Why talk about the Party and the country? I still hope that you will not go this far. Therefore, I am not afraid of trouble and will give you my final advice, end the useless debate, stop the ominous actions, rein in at the edge of the cliff, and maintain peace. This is the great fortune of the Party and the country. Chiang Kai-shek bows to you, (26th Special Telegram)"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters announced Yan Xishan's reply to Chiang Kai-shek on the 24th, saying: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing, with respect, I have received your confidential telegram. I reply to your two points as follows: (1) The intention to withdraw can be cancelled by your intention to withdraw. The intention to withdraw by Xishan cannot be cancelled. (2) Xishan and Huanzhang's going abroad was forcibly stopped by you. Huanzhang is originally free in Shanxi and there is nothing to reply. As for the implementation of reorganization, Xishan has made every effort to implement it, reducing a total of thirty-six regiments of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The inspection committee's report is on file. Now, if we want to implement reorganization again, Xishan has investigated the situation and believes that it is difficult to implement unless the military power of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Group Armies is completely returned to the Party. This is my reply to you. The two points stated in Xishan's telegram, the All-Party Congress is the highest organ of the Party and the country and cannot be used as an excuse. We must find a way to eliminate it. The Party and the country take the Party as the main body, and the personal center of military force is an obstacle to the Party and the country. It should be returned to the Party all at once, and then reorganization should be implemented. In Xishan's humble opinion, this is confirmed as the key to the safety of the Party and the country. Therefore, I dare to ask for your instructions. You regret the Premier's humility and concession. Xishan believes that the Premier's concession to Yuan was forced by power. Our return of military power to the Party is a return to justice. The two are not necessarily related. Xishan has something that he does not need to say to you. Of the 406 representatives of the Third National Congress, 211 were designated, 122 were selected, and only 73 were purely elected. Those who believe in your reasoning believe that reorganization and suppression are carried out in accordance with the Party's resolutions. Those who do not believe in you believe that the Third National Congress, in which more than half of the representatives were designated, is not the National Party's Third National Congress, but your Third National Congress. Reorganization and suppression are no different from your personal orders. The crisis of the Party and the country began here. It is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep. I hope you will observe this and beg for your reply. Respectfully, Yan Xishan."</p>

<h3 id="e5">Another French Cabinet Falls <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>French cabinets have historically been prone to collapse, but none have fallen as quickly as the Chautemps cabinet this time. In fact, according to the French system, after a cabinet is formed, it must pass a vote of confidence in the parliament to be confirmed. The Chautemps cabinet failed to pass the vote and fell, so it can be considered that it was never formed.</p>
<p>Our observation of the situation of the French political parties this time is as the Reuters telegram said. The time has not yet come for a purely leftist cabinet to gain a majority in the parliament. However, if one wants to reconcile the two sides and form a mixed cabinet of the left and right, it may also be difficult to maintain it permanently. Not to mention the radical socialist parties on the left may not readily cooperate. Even if they can barely cooperate, their doctrines are different and conflicts easily arise. Take the Chautemps cabinet this time as an example. The Socialist Party has always advocated reducing armaments to lighten the people's burden. Yesterday, the Socialist Party leader, Mr. Blum, already published an article to express his opposition to Tardieu's disarmament proposal. Today, Mr. Chautemps announced his views on disarmament, although he said that he would abide by the previous cabinet's policies, but in fact it contained the intention of modifying them to achieve success. This is also opposed to Tardieu's proposal. However, other parties mostly opposed the Chautemps cabinet's proposals. Looking at today's voting results, many expressed welcome to Tardieu. It is known that the doctrines of the two parties are different and there is no room for reconciliation. Moreover, political parties often like to borrow issues to attack other parties as a tool for political struggle. Leaving aside whether the fall of the Chautemps cabinet this time was due to the political struggle between the left and right or due to differences in naval policy, it is difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>As for the impact on the London conference, because the French cabinet has changed and is not yet settled, the time for the representative to attend has been postponed, so the impact on the London conference cannot be discussed quickly, which is small. If the change of cabinet also changes the cabinet's disarmament proposal, then the relationship is greater. Let us observe the results.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Ephemeral French Radical Party Cabinet <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Parliament Dissatisfied with New Policies</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Majority Voted No Confidence</p>
<p>Since the Establishment of the Third Republic</p>
<p>This Cabinet's Lifespan is the Shortest</p>
<p>Tardieu Will Rise Again to Form a Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 25th - Chautemps announced the new cabinet's policies in the Chamber of Deputies today, stating that regarding the London Five-Power Naval Conference, it would abide by the naval policies of the previous cabinet and would strive for successful negotiations within the scope of not hindering national security, as a necessary start to the Disarmament Conference. The Chamber of Deputies will vote on the new cabinet's confidence vote tonight.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 25th - The French government was defeated by 292 votes to 277 and will resign immediately. Its failure was due to the cabinet's policy statement. Another telegram stated that after the Chamber of Deputies voted, Chautemps went to the Presidential Palace to submit the cabinet's resignation. This is the shortest-lived cabinet since the establishment of the Third French Republic. When the results of the vote were announced, the Chamber of Deputies responded with cries of "Long live Tardieu!" and the crowds outside the parliament also echoed the same cries. Judging from this result, it is now clear that there is no majority for a purely left-wing government in the current Chamber of Deputies. Public opinion believes that the only true and powerful government that can be formed will be a mixed cabinet without the participation of the extreme right wing or the Socialist Party. However, whether the Radical Party is willing to cooperate is highly uncertain. Another option would be Tardieu's second cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 26th - After the fall of the Chautemps cabinet, Tardieu was summoned to the Presidential Palace this morning. Tardieu told the President that there are currently four major international issues to be resolved: the London Naval Conference, the Geneva Conference, the implementation of the Young Plan, and the troop deployment negotiations in the Saar region. He believes that Poincaré is most capable of organizing a stable cabinet and is very willing to cooperate with him. The President later explored Poincaré's intentions. Poincaré replied that he could not bear the heavy responsibility of forming a cabinet due to his weak health. Tardieu is currently trying to form a new cabinet.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The French Political Situation Affects the Progress of the London Conference <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th - The failure of the Chautemps cabinet has made the status of the London Conference even more complicated. The leaders of the delegations from the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, and Japan will meet this afternoon to discuss whether to suspend the meeting for several more days to wait for France to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - A British spokesperson stated today that the idea of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan signing a treaty to resolve the disputes at the London Conference has never been considered. The London Conference does not have any disputes. Although there has been much discussion about concluding a Locarno Treaty for the Mediterranean, there has been no special proposal. Furthermore, the issue of freedom of the seas has not been raised at the conference.</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - A telegram from London states:</p>
<p>Experts from various countries gathered at 5 p.m. on the 25th to discuss the issue of restrictions on the use of submarines, in an informal exchange of opinions. The French side proposed applying the same rules as for surface ships, acknowledging restrictions on the use of submarines. The U.S. delegate advocated for the revival of the Washington Treaty, but the countries had no objections to Articles 1 and 2. The experts' meeting is now concluded. Further discussions will be held by the submarine experts' committee in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Philippine Independence Convention <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Boycott Movement is Still Underway</p>
<p>Opinions on the Method of Independence Vary Greatly</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 25th - The Philippine Independence Convention held its fourth plenary session today. The assembly resolved to propose a motion tomorrow declaring that if it is discovered that American and foreign merchants oppose Philippine independence, their goods will be boycotted. Initially, the convention only intended to instill the idea of freedom in the minds of the Filipino people. Now that it sees the U.S. government appearing to deny the Filipino people this freedom, it is taking further action. However, the leaders now have widely divergent opinions on the method of independence. Some advocate for a neutral position, enjoying preferential commercial rights for ten years, while others advocate for complete separation from the United States and independence.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Downward Trend in Japanese Politics <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Bribery Cases in This General Election Have Increased Sharply</p>
<p>Bureaucracy Has Turned into Mammonism</p>
<p>Tokyo Special Dispatch - In recent years, a new trend has gradually emerged in Japanese politics. The various so-called "scandal cases" that occurred last year triggered a major political crisis, which is clear evidence that bureaucracy has further evolved into mammonism. This trend is even more undeniable in this general election. At the beginning of the general election, the Ministry of Justice and the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court sent investigators to various places to investigate the truth about the election. According to their investigation results, bribery cases have increased significantly compared to the first general election. More than 270 people have been prosecuted by the Prosecutor's Office for violating the election law. In the previous general election, the number of people who violated the election law was only 165, an increase of more than 100 this time. Furthermore, in the previous general election, there were few cases involving money. This time, bribery cases account for the majority. The sordidness and corruption of Japanese politics are increasingly trending downward, which can be seen in general. The details of the cases are recorded as follows: bribery, 219 people; election violence, 3 people; election interference, 1 person; visits to households, 12 people; interference with election of officials, 1 person; written propaganda, 5 people; other, 36 people.

<h3 id="e61">Indian Independence is Inevitable <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Young India is Not What It Used to Be</p>
<p>It No Longer Considers Itself Inferior</p>
<p>The UK's Unemployment Problem is Severe</p>
<p>It Dares Not Provoke India</p>
<p>Translated by Yun Jieshe C.F. Andrews wrote in an article: "Over the past six months, the Indian political situation has been turbulent. After the Governor-General of India announced that the British government intended to grant India dominion status and convened a conference in London, the political turmoil came to an end. Today, all thoughtful people in India feel that the United Kingdom is particularly concerned about India because of its domestic unemployment problem. After all, India is the UK's best customer, and it dares not provoke it at this time. Looking at the UK's new attitude towards China, is the reason not also highly thought-provoking?</p>
<p>Young India has felt its own new strength and no longer considers itself inferior. The younger generation of the Kuomintang strongly advocates for complete separation from the UK and is not willing to accept dominion status. Their recognized leader, Nehru, once declared to the newspaper, 'It is unimaginable to hold peace talks while the British government is waging war against us. This kind of meeting must be premised on ending the current oppressive methods that are similar to warfare. The British government must clearly express that it will base the negotiations on the demands of the Indian National Congress, and must not just prevaricate.' Gandhi also said regarding the British declaration, 'Any such meeting must be like Caesar's wife, beyond all suspicion.' However, Gandhi is willing to accept the proposal to hold a meeting in London under certain conditions. He then convened a conference of leaders of various political parties and religions. The reporter has seen the list, which is indeed representative. The left-wing representatives included Nehru, and the right-wing representatives included Srinivasa Sastri. The conference results released a unanimously passed declaration in the newspaper, requesting three things: (1) The London Conference should be held in a peaceful atmosphere; (2) A political amnesty should be granted; (3) The representatives of the Indian people participating in the London Conference should be mostly members of the Indian National Congress.</p>
<p>The above three points should not be too difficult to implement. However, the declaration also requested the Governor-General of India to acknowledge their interpretation of the meaning of the Governor-General's declaration to avoid misunderstandings. According to their interpretation, the London Conference itself should submit the form of the Indian self-government constitution to the British Parliament. As such, the Governor-General's declaration has two levels: one is to aim for dominion status, and the other is to hold a kind of meeting. The leaders of all factions in India believe that the self-government constitution should be decided by the conference. So far, according to various reports from India, the leaders of all factions have not disagreed with this interpretation, while most British newspapers have not made the same interpretation. Furthermore, negotiations in India have progressed to the point of drafting a self-government constitution, and British newspapers are still unaware. In short, the reformed constitution promulgated in 1921 has many shortcomings and is not suitable. Since the British government has given India responsible government, it must make it fully responsible. If it gives with the right hand and takes back with the left, it is not a bright and aboveboard political tactic, and it is also useless and harmful."</p>
<h3 id="e62">United States Intends to Intervene in the Dominican Republic's Troubles <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 25th - The committee sent by the U.S. President to inspect the Republic of Haiti has just departed today, while at the same time, the Dominican Republic is reported to be experiencing a serious revolution. The Santo Domingo Treaty, signed in 1924, stipulates that customs receivers should have adequate protection when necessary to exercise their duties. Therefore, if the turmoil in that country continues unresolved, it is expected that the United States will temporarily intervene based on this treaty. "Another telegram from Port-au-Prince (Haiti) states" that according to American tourists who arrived here today, there was an attempted uprising in the Dominican capital, resulting in three or four injuries. The reason for the sudden revolution in that country is that President Vasquez intends to be re-elected after his term expires this year, causing dissatisfaction among the people, who rose up to attack him. In addition, the economic decline after the coffee and sugar industry trends is also a reason. "Another telegram from Santo Domingo" states that the revolutionary army has occupied the San Cristobal Fortress in Santo Domingo and is now advancing here. President Vasquez and the Vice President have resigned to Congress, and an executive will be elected in the coming days to form a provisional government. "Another telegram" states that the Dominican President told the Associated Press reporter today that he has not resigned and that it is difficult to leave his post without authorization in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.</p>
<p>Haiti Island is smaller than Cuba and is the second largest island in the West Indies. It is home to two republics, Haiti and the Dominican Republic (Domingo in yesterday's report). The Dominican Republic occupies the eastern part of Haiti Island. It became independent from Spain in 1844 and has a population of 600,000, mostly Spaniards and mixed-race people.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Central Political Conference <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The 217th Meeting</p>
<p>The Central Political Conference held its 217th meeting this morning (26th) at 8 a.m. The attending committee members were Lin Sen, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Ye Chucang, Wang Chongxian, Tan Yankai, Li Yuying, Zhang Renjie, He Yingqin, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, and Shao Liz. The observers were Li Wenfan, Fang Juehui, Jiao Yitang, Enhebatou, Wang Zhengting, Liu Jiwen, Chen Lifu, Zeng Yangfu, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Kong Xiangxi, Liu Luyin, and Liu Wendao. The chairman was Tan Yankai. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) The Economic Group reported that the request from the Executive Yuan to interpret and determine the limits of central and local authority in the third item regarding transportation was submitted for review. Land and water routes, and other transportation, that pass through more than two provinces are to be developed and operated by the central government; those that connect more than two counties are to be developed and operated by the provincial government; and those within the jurisdiction of a city or county are to be developed and operated by the city or county government. The phrase "land and water routes and other transportation" was reviewed and interpreted to mean that the land and water routes and other transportation businesses mentioned in the third item of the limits of central and local authority refer specifically to ordinary boats, vehicles, roads, canals, bridges, and other items that do not have a nationally consistent nature. However, urban telephones also fall under the scope of local transportation matters. Those that have already been handled by the Ministry of Communications should continue to be handled by the ministry. If local governments are unable to operate them but are capable of doing so, they may operate them themselves with the approval of the Ministry of Communications. If local governments are unable to operate them, they should still be operated by the Ministry of Communications. Whether this is appropriate is still subject to public decision. It was resolved to pass the interpretation proposed by the Economic Group. (2) The Legislative Yuan sent the draft of the Organization Law of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for review and implementation. It was resolved to submit it to the Economic Group, Financial Group, and Political Reporting Group for review. (3) It was resolved that the Wuhan Provisional Commercial Court should be closed immediately upon the expiration of its term. All files should be transferred to the local court of that area, and the seals and instruments should be transferred to the Hubei Provincial Government. The closing expenses should be reviewed and issued by the Ministry of Finance. The question of whether the debt settlement standards applied by the court should continue to be valid was submitted to Committee Member Wang Chonghui for review. (4) It was resolved that the request from Zhu Shouguang, Political Vice Minister and Acting Minister of Political Affairs, to resign from all his concurrent positions be approved. The resignation of Zhu Shouguang from his concurrent position as Acting Minister of Military and Political Affairs was approved, and He Yingqin was specially appointed to concurrently serve as Minister of Military and Political Affairs. (5) It was resolved that the resignation of Wang Jinyu, Committee Member and Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, be approved, and Ma Fuxiang was appointed as Committee Member and Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government. (6) It was resolved that Ma Fuxiang, the Mayor of Qingdao Special Municipality, should be relieved of his post because he has another appointment, and Ge Jingen was appointed as the Mayor of Qingdao Special Municipality. (7) It was resolved that Wu Jiaxiang should fill the vacancy of Wang Yugui, Committee Member and Director of the Department of Education of the Liaoning Provincial Government, due to illness. (8) The Secretariat of the National Government stated that the 60th State Council meeting resolved to appoint Deng Yanhua, Fan Qiwu, and Lin Yunhai as members of the Guangdong River Management Committee, requesting retroactive approval. It was resolved to grant retroactive approval.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Ministry of Industry and Commerce Requests Allocation of Boxer Indemnity Funds to Establish a Special Bank <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Implementing the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Handling International Exchange</p>
<p>Since the gold-expensive-silver-cheap trend began, the National Government has instructed the Ministries of Industry and Commerce and Finance to carefully devise thorough relief measures. The Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has now drafted a plan to request the allocation of Boxer Indemnity funds to establish a special bank, with the aim of implementing the gold standard and international exchange. Minister Kong has reviewed it and forwarded it to the ministry's council for review. After that, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The reasons and methods proposed are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons: (1) The silver cheap trend is sweeping the world. The use of gold coins is almost unanimously advocated by the people of our country. In January of this year, the National Government even issued a clear order to collect customs duties in gold units. Following this trend, it is undoubtedly true that our currency will advance to either a real gold standard or a virtual gold standard. However, once the standard is planned to be in gold, regardless of whether it is real or virtual, it is essential to prepare a large sum of money as the basis for reform, and it is especially necessary to have a great and stable financial institution to mediate in the middle. Japan's use of gold relied on our country's reparations; Germany's use of gold utilized French reparations. Our country certainly has no hope of benefiting from other countries' reparations, but the refund of reparations to our country should be specially utilized. According to the Boxer Indemnity, since 1930, after France designated other uses, the principal and interest of the seven countries, Russia, Britain, Japan, the United States, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, still have more than 370 million silver dollars remaining. However, the remaining silver dollars must be allocated by the customs in installments each year. Now, it is planned to issue a certain number of customs gold unit bonds in proportion to this huge amount, and use the funds raised to organize a special bank, called the Gengjian Bank. From then on, when the state adopts the gold standard, all international exchange, gold storage, and gold coin minting will be handled by the bank. If there are concerns about its capabilities, consider that when Liang Qichao, the director of the Currency System Bureau, discussed reforming the currency system in 1916, there was a proposal for a loan from the United States for the currency system. If the Gengjian Bank is successfully established, then in the future, the currency system loan can be directly entrusted to the bank, which may be easier than in 1916. If this opportunity is missed, the Boxer Indemnity funds will be used up, the bank will not be able to be established, and currency reform will not easily raise huge sums of money. If the silver cheap trend continues to worsen, when will the harm to the national economy and people's livelihood stop? This is the first reason why it is necessary to allocate Boxer Indemnity funds to establish a special bank to promote the gold standard. (2) The most advantageous aspect of the sharp decline in silver prices for our country is to promote direct overseas trade. However, to promote direct overseas trade, it is necessary to establish a stable and solid international exchange institution. According to the 1928 customs report, the value of goods exported from our country was approximately 140 million yuan, of which 100 million yuan in value relied solely on bank exchange. Previously, most of the native products exported overseas were controlled by foreign merchants using the power of their own national financial institutions (such as HSBC, Credit Lyonnais, Citibank, and Yokohama Specie Bank), resulting in domestic merchants being monopolized and oppressed by them for decades. For example, silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and tea from Hunan and Hubei, were all exploited by foreign merchants and could not be revitalized. The reason why they cannot be directly sold to international markets is simply because the strength of domestic financial institutions is too weak. If the Gengjian Bank is established in a timely manner and set up in major commercial ports around the world, then taking advantage of this silver cheap opportunity, all domestic goods that can be sold overseas will rely on the bank to circulate, collect as much as possible, promote sales overseas, and absorb the world's cash back into our country, even reaching the hope of offsetting exports and imports. It can also establish a solid foundation for direct overseas trade in the future. This is the second reason why it is necessary to allocate Boxer Indemnity funds to establish a special bank to promote international exchange. (3) The seven countries that refunded the Boxer Indemnity originally had specific designated uses. However, the repayment period for Russia, Belgium, and the Netherlands ends in 1940, while the period for Britain, Japan, and the United States ends in 1945. Only Italy ends in 1948. In other words, the Boxer Indemnity funds relied upon for various purposes have only eleven years remaining for Russia, Belgium, and the Netherlands from 1930, and sixteen years for Britain, Japan, and the United States. Italy only has nineteen years remaining, all of which are less than twenty years. With such a huge sum of money being sacrificed at once, there is no continuous nature in more than a decade. How about a miraculous plan to create something from nothing? Establishing a special bank, separately gathering people from various Boxer Indemnity committees, managing its affairs, and allocating the annual profits to each Boxer Indemnity committee according to the original amount of Boxer Indemnity from each country, and allowing them to spend according to the agreement. In one shift, what was previously paid with silver is now the interest generated by the silver. What was abruptly terminated in twenty years is now extended indefinitely, and the time limit is just right. This is the third reason why it is necessary to utilize the remaining huge amount in the future to establish a special bank for the Boxer Indemnity itself. (4) Premier Sun Yat-sen's railway plan once set the national goal at 100,000 li. Last year, the remaining amount of the Boxer Indemnity was originally proposed to be used as a fund, with two-thirds for road construction and one-third for river management. However, according to this method, the achievements of road construction and river management using all the remaining funds are limited. Moreover, overall planning of the country's basic industrial and commercial business is not limited to road construction and river management. If this name is used to first organize a special bank, then all previously decided road construction and river management projects, such as those that need to be advanced or raised through bond issues, can now be undertaken by the bank without any changes. When the bank undertakes such national business, such as railways, if it is asked to advance funds, there must be considerable collateral within the railway area. If it is asked to issue bonds, there must be formal bonds for the road. In addition to the interests of handling fees, the standard for issuing or not issuing bonds can be determined based on the bank's own financial activity. When finances are active, they are deposited in the warehouse and eat the interest on the debt. When finances are exhausted, they should be issued to European and American or domestic trading markets to absorb cash. In the past, when our country discussed building railways, foreign silver companies competed to handle the matter. Road A was like this, and roads B, C, and D, to the point of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's plan for 100,000 li of railways, were all handled in this way. It's not just railways. Extending this to river management, as long as the benefits are stable, they are happy to engage in it. Therefore, with this great financial institution, in one shift, industrial and commercial industries have a revolving basis, and the national economy is also invigorated. Vagrants are eliminated, and society is stabilized. This is the fourth reason why it is necessary to allocate Boxer Indemnity funds to establish a special bank to expand road construction and river management and develop various national industries.</p>
<p>Methods: (1) Allocate the remaining balance of the Boxer Indemnity funds from Russia, Britain, Japan, the United States, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands after 1930, approximately 370 million yuan in national currency, as collateral, and issue 220 million yuan of customs gold unit bonds, named the "1930 Seven-Percent Boxer Indemnity Bonds." (2) After raising the bond funds, a certain amount will be retained to repay the originally designated uses of each related country in full for the initial years, and the remainder will be allocated to the bank's fund. (3) The purpose of the business is to handle international exchange. However, all reforms of the currency system, construction of large ports, laying of national railways, development of water conservancy and mineral resources, and various national social production projects can also be specified in special chapters and mortgaged for loans. (4) The bank, according to its special organization, shall have the right to issue gold notes. (5) The head office shall be located in the government seat or the largest and most prosperous commercial port in the country. Branches shall be established in various provinces and cities, depending on the necessity of the business, and branches may also be established in important commercial ports overseas. (6) The property rights of the bank shall be owned by all the people of China. In addition to repaying the originally designated uses of each related country in full on schedule, the remaining business profits shall be used as public reserve funds. (7) To prevent any eventuality, within the repayment period of the Boxer Indemnity, a certain amount shall be allocated and stored from the government and customs revenue, and the principal and interest shall be declared guaranteed. However, when the bank has public reserve funds, the public reserve funds shall be used to make up for any deficiencies. (8) The issuance of bonds is scheduled to be amortized over seventeen years. The principal and interest reported for each year's redemption of bonds shall be paid from the Boxer Indemnity funds due from the customs for each period. Any shortfall shall be made up from the bank's public reserve funds. (9) The bank's management shall consist of a president, vice president, directors, and supervisors. Before the Boxer Indemnity is fully repaid, they shall be appointed by the government after being jointly elected by the Boxer Indemnity committees of each related country, the founders, the Education Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of the National Banking Association. As for how the bank is organized, how the business is operated, how the bonds are issued, and how the Boxer Indemnity funds are paid, Department Member He Xikang has previously written a book entitled "Opinions on Establishing a Gengjian Construction Bank," which is attached for reference. Whether the above is appropriate, I respectfully hope for a decision. (Riri News)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Tight Security on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the telegraph from Yan Xishan was sent, He Chengjun, the director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters and the commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army, believing that Hubei Province is located in the center of the country and is a hub for both north and south, has paid special attention to the security of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway and northern Hubei for the sake of consolidating the overall situation. On the 23rd, he received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, ordering that all troops of the Second Route Army in Hubei and Henan, as well as the newly formed divisions and independent brigades, and the entire Fifth Route Army under his direct command, be under the command and dispatch of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, and that the security of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway and northern Hubei also be the responsibility of the Provisional Headquarters. After receiving the order, He Chengjun redeployed the troops and made careful arrangements. Commander-in-Chief Chiang previously replied to Yan Xishan, saying that he had spied on Xiangwan to the south and went straight to Wuhan. There were also rumors that the remnants of Zhang Weixi's Shaanxi army were concentrating in Baihe to go out of Jingziguan again. At that time, in the midst of the changing situation, Hubei Province was not without considerable influence. Now, heavy troops have been deployed and key positions are being defended. Even if there is reaction on the side, they will not dare to try lightly. Furthermore, yesterday, Chen Guangzu, chief of staff of the Fifth Route Army Headquarters, was appointed chief of staff of the Provisional Headquarters; Zhu Chuanjing, chief of staff of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, was appointed senior staff officer; Xu Chengxi, director of the office; Bao Zhun, secretary; and Hua Jueming, confidential secretary, to be responsible for the work. As for the Fifth Route Army Headquarters, it will not be restored for the time being, and will be reorganized when necessary. (February 24th)</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Zhang Zhen's troops stationed in southern Fujian received an order from the central government on the 16th to transfer to Chaozhou and Meizhou in Guangdong to assist the local government in suppressing bandits. Wang Chengyun, the commander of the first regiment of Zhang Zhen's troops, arrived in Shantou on the 17th aboard the Fulong and Xing Lion ships. The second and third battalions immediately left for Chao'an. The regimental headquarters was located in the Huangjia Ancestral Hall in Xuecuo Lane. The troops were stationed in Nijia Ancestral Hall, Wujia Ancestral Hall, Xiguan Academy, Zhangjia Ancestral Hall, Linjia Ancestral Hall, etc. Tang Bangzhen's regiment of Liu Heding's division was originally stationed in Chao'an City. After Wang's regiment arrived, it was decided to leave Chaozhou and return to Fujian today (the 20th). The Chao'an County Party Department and people from all walks of life held a banquet at the Hutian Restaurant on the 18th to bid farewell to Tang's regiment. After Wang Cheng's regiment arrived in Shantou, it sent a battalion to Jieyang on the 18th to suppress bandits in Puning and Huilai. Recently, bandits from Haifeng and Lufeng sneaked into Huilai. On the 16th, they broke through the Donggang Township Police Guard Office. Lin Qin, chairman of the Public Security Council, and several staff members were kidnapped. The bandits have been destroying the East Road Highway cars for days. The section from Yunluo to Kuitan has stopped traffic because the passenger cars were destroyed and several passengers, including a Ding, were kidnapped. Zheng Daji, the leader of the communist bandits in Motian Stone, Puning, and others gathered hundreds of bandits on the 16th, disguised as merchants and civilians, and sneaked into the pass of Huzizhai Township in Yunluo Market. The Yunluo Guard immediately went to intercept them. After an hour of fighting, six bandits were killed on the spot and more than ten bandits were injured. Four guards were killed and seven merchants and civilians were kidnapped by the bandits. The 16th regiment stationed in Chaoyang has sent troops to suppress them.</p>
<p>Jin Handing, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, stationed his troops in Changting last month to suppress Zhu and Mao. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters was located in Changting. On the 16th, Commander Jin received a telegram from Chairman Chiang to attend the Nanjing Division Commanders' Conference. He set off from Ting, passed through Wuping, Shanghang, and Dapu, and arrived in Chao'an on the evening of the 19th. He was accompanied only by a platoon of guards and Chief of Staff Cun Xingqi.

<h3 id="e74">The Boundary Issue between Jinan City and County <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jinan Municipal Government began to draw a map of the urban area, the scope of which was to completely include the area within twenty li of Jinan City into the urban area. The representatives of the various circles of Licheng County held a meeting and decided to oppose it. As a result, there was the issue of the boundary between the city and the county. Representatives of the county government and the county party department initially met with Zhao Jingshi, the mayor of Jinan, to exchange opinions. The city side argued that the urban area was set within twenty li around, based on the Jinan garrison area in the past, which is now the scope of the Public Security District, and not to seek expansion outside the scope. The county side reasoned that if it is set within twenty li, it must be east to Lengshui Ditch, west to Yinma Village, south to the Watershed Ridge, and north across the Yellow River to Balidian. There would be little remaining in Licheng County. Moreover, the western boundary to Yinma Village will even be within the territory of Changqing County. Although the Jinan garrison area was within twenty li in the past, it did not conflict with the administration of the county. If the urban area is now within twenty li and the county area is outside twenty li, there are many villages within twenty li that are included in the urban area, which has made the county administration and party affairs inconsistent. The tax revenue will be greatly affected. Therefore, it is requested that the urban area should still be within the scope of the city gate and commercial port. The talks did not resolve the issue at that time. It was only agreed that the city and county sides each appoint four representatives to hold another meeting. On Saturday and Sunday, the county representatives Wu Zizhen, Zhao Tongyuan, Li Rongfu, and Shen Kunfei went to the municipal government and met with the city representatives Cheng Qibao and Zhang Hongjian. After some discussion, although there was a close hope, there was still no concrete solution. It is said that the city representatives advocated submitting a request to the provincial government for a decision. (21st)</p>

<p>Young Monk Loses Both Wife and Money: Zhao Xiaoheshang, a farmer from Lingjia Village in Qingpu, works as a carpenter. His mother, seeing that her son had come of age, asked someone to act as an intermediary. This matter was learned by Dai, a Jiading native who was accustomed to acting as an "ant matchmaker" (engaging in illicit matchmaking).</p>
<p>Dai colluded with an accomplice named Gu and went to Zhao Xiaoheshang's house, pretending to go to a lottery gathering together and visit along the way. Afterward, they often visited Zhao's house to chat, pretending to ask where his sister-in-law was. The mother replied that she was currently asking someone to act as a matchmaker, hoping they would pay attention to any suitable families. Dai readily agreed and left. Several days later, Dai came and told Zhao Xiaoheshang's mother that there was a Zhang woman, a native of Huzhou, whose parents had both died and who lived with her brother in a neighboring village. She needed a betrothal gift of 150 gold yuan, as well as gold jewelry and clothing worth about 200 yuan. The mother replied that she did not have such financial resources. Finally, they agreed on a bride price of 100 yuan and a matchmaking fee of 20 yuan to marry the woman. After she entered the house, the couple was still harmonious, but she was lazy and unwilling to work. Her son still went out to work, leaving in the morning and returning in the evening, as was his custom. Unexpectedly, the Zhang woman took advantage of her husband's absence the other day and ran away with her clothes and jewelry. When Xiaoheshang returned home, he did not see his wife. He opened the box and found that all the valuable clothes and items had been taken away, worth about 100 yuan. He immediately rushed to Dai's place to inquire, but Dai was also gone. Zhao Xiaoheshang realized that he had been the victim of an "ant matchmaker" and went to confront Gu, the accomplice. It is unknown what the outcome was.</p>

Xue Zhu heard Gu return and panicked. She shouted, "You're back!" to signal Zhou to escape quickly. Gu, seeing this, became suspicious and rushed upstairs to his own room, but did not see his wife. He immediately turned around and went downstairs to search Xue Zhu's room. Sure enough, he saw his wife, Yang, and Zhou lying on Xue Zhu's bed. The two were putting on their clothes. Gu was enraged and tried to catch them in adultery, but was instead pushed to the ground. Zhou and Yang took the opportunity to escape. Gu chased after them, but could not find them. He later negotiated with Xue Zhu to demand the return of his wife, but it is said that Yang has not yet returned home.</p>

<p>The Truth About the Murder of the Quartermaster of the Military Police Regiment: Liang Changhua, the quartermaster director of the First Regiment of Military Police stationed in Zhenjiang, was ordered to go to Beijing to receive funds for the January military pay. When he was about to leave, Wen Xiaoxiong suddenly came and went with him. Liang did not suspect him because Wen was a classmate from the fourth term of Huangpu. Therefore, they went to Beijing by the same car. After arriving in Beijing, Wen invited Liang to stay at the Asia Hotel, saying that he had already booked a room. Two days later, Liang received 4,000 yuan in military pay from the Weiwu Command. The next morning, Quartermaster Liang was found brutally murdered with his head broken and bleeding, and the military pay he had received and Wen were both missing. The First Police Bureau, together with the local court, conducted an inspection. After the news spread, it was reported to Wei Yingshan, the director of the Beijing garrison office, by the First Regiment of Military Police. Chen Xiufeng, the regimental commander in Zhenjiang, received the news via long-distance telephone and took soldiers to Beijing. He immediately ordered Chen Xiwu, the captain of the intelligence team, to request the First Police Bureau and the local court to open the coffin for a second examination. The regimental commander and his followers confirmed that the deceased was Quartermaster Liang Changhua. The murderer is now being strictly pursued and brought to justice.</p>

<p>Refugees Steal Items and Are Escorted Out of the Territory: A large number of refugees arrived in Gongjiafan in the western countryside on the afternoon of the 22nd, and divided into teams to beg for money and rice from various residences. In the home of the wealthy Yin Hu Gong Xingpu, more than ten male and female refugees suddenly broke in. At that time, Xingpu was lying in bed due to illness. First, six men surrounded the bed and begged for help. At the same time, six or seven female refugees slipped into the kitchen and asked Xingpu's two daughters-in-law to provide relief. The two daughters-in-law each agreed to give three silver yuan and solicit donations from the neighbors for assistance. Amidst the commotion, three or four companions came in and said that the villagers had given them 18 silver yuan and some food. They then called the female refugees out and left the village in formation. Xingpu's eldest daughter-in-law (wife of Zhao Lin) suspected that the female refugees' disregard for the promised silver was suspicious, so she went upstairs to search the boxes and cabinets. Unexpectedly, nine gold rings, one gold hairpin, one gold pick, one gold lock, and one pair of gold bracelets (weighing more than 30 taels in total) hidden in the clothes were all gone, leaving only a pearl butterfly that had not been stolen. She then sent someone to follow the refugees to find their residence, and reported the theft to the county government for recovery of the stolen goods. The county government, based on the situation, immediately ordered the county defense team and many police officers from the Public Security Bureau to go to the Dongyue Temple, three miles away from the city, and take the refugee leaders Wang Zhaolin, Wang Jindong, Wang Yongqing, and five others to the county. They were interrogated in court on the morning of the 23rd. They claimed to be from Huangmei County, Hubei, and arrived in Shangyu from Ningbo via Shaoxing on the 21st, and did not admit to any theft. However, after examining the passports, it was found that there were as many as 214 people registered, but only 134 people remained after checking. After repeated questioning, they firmly refused to confess. An order was issued to escort them and wait for instructions from the province. As for the hundred and several dozen refugees living in the Dongyue Temple, four fast boats from Fenghu, Mazhu, and Lianghu were sealed off on the morning of the 24th and ordered to leave the territory. The refugee side proposed conditions that they would not leave Shangyu unless the county released the five people who had been arrested. Finally, the county government presented the five refugee representatives, including Wang Zhaolin, who were detained, added instruments of torture, and prepared a document to be sent to the Yuyao County Government for transfer to the Ningbo Local Court for legal handling. The remaining refugees were escorted onto the ship by a large team of soldiers and police and also went to Yuyao.</p>

The county government has previously provided relief, but the amount of porridge was small and the monks were many, making it difficult to sustain. The village chiefs' joint meeting decided to recommend Zhang Songlou, Wei Ao, and others as representatives to go to the county to petition for continued relief funds. It is said that there are currently more than 7,600 disaster victims in the three townships, which is really not enough to distribute the relief funds.</p>

<p>Sanhe Merchant Corps Repels Lake Bandits: The Sanhe Town Merchant Corps of Feinan, consisting of more than 30 members, escorted more than 200,000 yuan of cash to Wuwei and hired civilian boats. On the 20th, when passing through the southern part of Chaohu Lake on their way back, they were suddenly surrounded by three bandit boats full of bandits who shouted to surrender their weapons. A certain captain of the Merchant Corps immediately fired a pistol, shooting a bandit in black clothes into the lake. The bandits then fired their guns in unison, and the Merchant Corps also resisted as a whole, firing with machine guns. The bandits gradually became unable to withstand the attack. Just then, the Chaohu Water Police heard the sound and sent two patrol boats to assist. The battle lasted until dusk, and the bandit boats fled into the darkness. Two members of the Merchant Corps were shot in the legs and were taken to the city for treatment.</p>
<p>Joint Suppression of Bandits by Hefei and Lu'an Counties: The bandit atmosphere is rampant in the area where Ma Ji, Taiping Ji, Jin Qiao, and Guanting intersect between Hefei and Lu'an counties. Travelers are hesitant to travel, and transportation is cut off. County Magistrate Wang telegraphed County Magistrate Gao of Lu'an yesterday, scheduling to personally lead the team to suppress the bandits on the 25th. Lu'an was also requested to send a team to block and suppress the bandits in the Jin Qiao area in order to eliminate them in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Japan's Cultural Aggression in Our Northeast</p>
<p>Specially Compiled Textbooks for Public Primary Schools</p>
<p>To Anesthetize the Will of Our Country's Youth</p>
<p>Promote the Ambition of Japanese Children to Invade Manchuria</p>
<p>(Dalian News) Japan's cultural aggression in our Northeast is meticulous. Therefore, the South Manchuria Railway has information investigation departments, and the Kwantung Government also has various facilities. As for newspapers, there are as many as 27, and magazines are as many as 133. This is common. In addition, it has especially used its anesthetizing skills on our young people with weak wills. Within the territory of Lushun and Dalian, there are two types of schools established by the Kwantung Government: ordinary schools (four grades, etc.) currently number 109, and public schools number 10 (six grades). The South Manchuria Railway Company has also established ten public schools along the South Manchuria Railway. For the teaching materials of these public schools, the Kwantung Government and the South Manchuria Railway Company jointly established a South Manchuria Textbook Research Institute, researching Japanese school textbooks on the one hand, and researching the teaching materials of public primary schools on the other, so as to promote the ambition of Japanese children to invade Manchuria and Mongolia, and eliminate the national outlook and national character of Chinese youths. It is heard that the research institute has recently compiled a special textbook for public primary schools, which is more advanced than before, so as to thoroughly enslave the weak-willed little citizens. The textbook is scheduled to be used this semester. As for its content, I will report it in a later issue. (20th)</p>

<p>The Education Program Compilation Committee of the Ministry of Education held a standing committee meeting at the Ministry of Education from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on the 25th. Committee members Yu Ziyi and Tao Xuan, as well as the Vice Minister, Directors, and Counselors of the Ministry of Education, were present. They first discussed the social education program (the most important part of this program is mass education, such as citizen literacy training, which has been incorporated into the adult remedial education plan), and a general decision was made: (1) to determine the goals and implementation methods of social education; (2) to plan vocational remedial education for farmers, workers, and merchants, as well as domestic affairs education; (3) to promote and reward art education methods; (4) to draft education methods for national independence movements from the perspective of social education; (5) to stipulate matters related to social education and school education (such as social education institutions attached to rural primary schools, etc.). The above items will be implemented separately within six years, with varying degrees of urgency. Also, (1) to promote public sports and implement the physical education law promulgated by the National Government; (2) to plan for the improvement of social customs and public entertainment (such as improving opera, drum storytelling, shadow plays, establishing model theaters, public tea rooms, etc., and methods for supervising and guiding social education institutions established by public and private organizations), which are planned to be implemented within one or two years. Also, (1) to plan for the establishment of central and provincial music halls, etc.; (2) to plan for the establishment of central and the promotion of provincial libraries, and to compile popular reading materials and various popular publications, which are planned to be implemented within three or four years. Also, (1) to plan for the establishment of central and provincial museums, and to formulate matters for the preservation of documents and antiquities; (2) to plan for special education for the mentally and physically disabled, and the rehabilitation education of criminals, which are planned to be implemented within five or six years. Although these were the opinions discussed at the time, it was generally agreed that the popularization of social education within six years should depend on economic capacity, and it should be carried out either in stages or simultaneously. Around 2:00 PM, because the full text of the social education program was very long, Director Chen presented the main points, and after discussion, a general decision was made. As for the content of the program, Vice Minister Liu will later designate a committee to slightly revise the wording, and it will be considered finalized. Then, the Mongolian and Tibetan education program was discussed. Counselor Wu Meixuan of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (who is the director of the Mongolian and Tibetan group of the program committee) attended and reported the main points of the Mongolian and Tibetan education program. Then, a detailed discussion was held on the brought program, such as the higher education and general education programs for Mongolia and Tibet, and solutions were discussed for each. The most important thing is to plan to establish three middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools within six years as a step towards promoting Mongolian and Tibetan education. The discussion continued late into the night. Regarding the Mongolian and Tibetan education program, except for the two items of educational administration and social education, which Counselor Wu will continue to send to the Ministry for review and signing by the committee members, the rest were passed. The Ministry of Education has been holding program meetings for days, and the Vice Minister, Directors, Counselors, etc., have been holding meetings during the day and reviewing official documents at night, which is extremely busy. At this point, the program meeting came to a brief conclusion, and normal work was resumed.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Current Situation of Education in the Special District of Eastern Provinces <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Paying Attention to the Education of Naturalized White Russian Children</p>
<p>The education sector in the Special District of Eastern Provinces has made considerable progress in recent years. There are currently eight male middle schools, two female middle schools, one industrial high school, more than seventy primary schools, and three specialized schools (medical, fine arts, and normal), but not including universities. All schools below the specialized level are directly under the jurisdiction of the Education Department. There are also more than thirty schools for children of Soviet railway employees and more than sixty Russian侨schools, which are also under the jurisdiction of the Education Department. The current Director is Mr. Zhang Guochen, who has only been in office for one year and has worked hard to govern, making much progress in educational facilities. Within the Department, he has organized various committees to discuss matters of reform. Important ones include the Committee for Revising Regulations, the Committee for Reviewing the Education of Naturalized Children, the Committee for Clearing the Education Funds in Arrears for the Seventeenth Year, the Committee for Reorganizing Russian僑Schools, the Committee for Literary and Artistic Review, and the Committee for Planning School Buildings, not to mention the Administrative Conference, the Education Conference, and the Joint Conference of Principals. Among the various committees, the Committee for Reviewing the Education of Naturalized Children is the most valuable. Most of the White Russians in the Special District have been naturalized as Chinese citizens, but in the past, no attention has been paid to the education of their children. Often, the father is a Chinese citizen, but the children still attend Russian侨schools, and although they are nominally Chinese, they do not know Chinese, and remain alienated from the Chinese. This is very different from the original intention of allowing them to naturalize. Mr. Zhang organized the committee to discuss reforming this malpractice. However, due to various difficulties, the result of the discussion was to start with the young, that is, the naturalized children who have just reached school age. From this year, they will all be required to enter Chinese schools and will not be allowed to be admitted or transferred to Russian僑schools or other schools. Those who have already entered other schools and are younger and in lower grades will also be transferred to Chinese schools, with the aim of gradually making naturalized children (i.e., those who have become citizens) receive complete Chinese education. This measure not only concerns the education of naturalized children, but also brings unlimited benefits to the Northeast, especially along the Eastern Railway, in the future. In terms of schools, those newly established last year include the Fine Arts Specialized School, the Eighth Male Middle School, the Second Female Middle School, and the Twenty-Fourth Primary School in the First School District, as well as the recovery of the Normal School run by Russian僑schools, the establishment of a Russian Language Normal College, and the addition of more than twenty grades to various primary schools. This year, two more primary schools will be added in Shuangchengpu and Erdahezi, and it is planned to add ten more primary school grades, all with funding, and work has begun.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Jiangsu Education Department Issues Circular Stipulating That Education Fees Must Not Be Changed <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department issued instructions to the directors of the education bureaus of sixty-one counties, saying: It is hereby notified that increasing education funding and guaranteeing its independence are included in the political program. Most of the education funding in various counties of the province is dedicated funds. Whether the name has been clearly designated as education fees, or the name is not education fees, but it has long been designated as education fees and has been included in the budget for many years, it must not be arbitrarily changed. The previous Central Executive Yuan has repeatedly ordered various counties to comply with this. However, recently, it has been found that Dongtai, Taixing, and other counties have proposed to divert the funds for local chronicles and rural administration, which have long been designated as education fees, to other uses. It should be that violating the established plan hinders education fees. After consultation with the Finance Department and the dispatch of personnel for investigation, it has been strictly ordered not to allow it. At the beginning of political tutelage, it is extremely important to vigorously promote the popularization of education. Education funding is being increased year by year in order to gradually expand the undertaking and achieve the goal of popularization. If the inherent funding that has been decided can be arbitrarily overturned, not only will the existing undertaking be affected, but education funding will also lose its guarantee, which is contrary to the party's emphasis on education. It is hereby reiterated that all education funding that has been decided in various counties, whether the name has been corrected or not, and has been allocated as education fees in fact, must not be changed without authorization. In addition to submitting a request to the provincial government to issue a circular to all counties to comply with this, and issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered to be notified. This order.</p>

The Department has now formulated six provisional standards for the effective period of certified primary school teachers in Jiangsu Province and announced them for implementation. In the future, matters concerning requests to extend the effective period will be handled in accordance with these standards. The standards are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Abolishing the University Preparatory System</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau submitted a document to the Ministry of Education yesterday, saying: A document is submitted to request the abolition of the university preparatory system for inspection and verification. It is believed that the establishment of a university is originally intended to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents. Its students must have a foundation in learning and be of appropriate age to be able to receive university education. Recently, it has been found that many universities in the country have preparatory departments attached to them, recruiting students who do not have the qualifications to enter the university, or even setting a preparatory period of three years and recruiting students who have just graduated from junior high school, nominally preparing for entering the regular department, giving young people the opportunity to study, but in fact disrupting the academic system and reducing the level of students. The original term of study for high school is three years, and the university preparatory is also set at three years, which is already inappropriate, such as only two years or one year, then the distinction is even more inappropriate. This is the first aspect that is not suitable in terms of academic programs. University training and management are relatively relaxed in all aspects in fact. Students must be of a certain age to avoid abuses. A junior high school graduate is only about fifteen years old. The age difference is too large. Studying in a school is not suitable for management. This is the second aspect that is not suitable. Moreover, according to the University Organization Law and the University Regulations, there is no provision for a preparatory department. However, domestic universities still set up preparatory departments, and private universities take this opportunity to widely recruit. All young people with shallow academic abilities flock to them for vain reputation, supply and demand correspond to each other and are used by each other, and the level of universities is declining day by day, and middle schools cannot be managed. The relationship with national education is very great. The bureau of directors sees the inappropriateness of the preparatory department, and in order to seek rectification, it specifically submitted the 136th bureau affairs meeting for resolution, requesting your department to issue a clear order to abolish the university preparatory system within a time limit. If it is necessary to establish a preparatory department, such as medical and engineering colleges that need to make up for German, and the connection method for students who have graduated from the old system of middle schools, please also order to comply with it. It will be beneficial to the students' study and self-cultivation. Is there anything appropriate? It is submitted for inspection and instructed to comply with it, which is in the public interest. Respectfully presented to Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Education, Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e105">A Record of the Opening Ceremony of Jianguo Middle School <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Principal Chen Gave Earnest Instructions</p>
<p>Jianguo Middle School on Zhiyuan Road in Zhabei, this city, has long been open. The first memorial week of this semester was held a few days ago, and the opening ceremony was held to make up for it. About 150 teachers, staff, and students attended. The ceremony was presided over by Mr. Chen Dezheng, the principal of the school. After the ceremony, Principal Chen gave a report on current affairs. After the report, he gave an earnest speech, mainly divided into the following three points: First, students must strictly abide by school rules, not only must they rectify order, but they should also work hard to study. Studying is not for fame and profit, but a necessary condition for survival. Therefore, all fluke thoughts should be eliminated. Second, students should study diligently and abide by the rules. Teachers and staff should set an example and be a model for students. The teachers and staff of this school are purely knowledgeable people, and students will benefit a lot from their teaching. However, there may be those who neglect to teach due to negligence. It has been instructed that the academic affairs department should pay close attention to this. If a teacher is absent from teaching once, the school will give a warning. If a teacher is absent from teaching twice, in addition to a serious warning, an appropriate punishment will be given. If a teacher is absent from teaching more than three times, another teacher will be hired immediately. The reason why the school advocates such strictness is entirely to respect students' studies. Therefore, students should follow school rules, respect teachers, and work hard at their studies. Third, co-education of men and women has become a major problem in education, but we still need to test it. During this test period, male and female students in our school must respect each other. Except for classes and self-study, male and female students must not joke with each other, nor may they enter each other's boarding places. Those who violate this will be immediately expelled and must leave the school within five minutes. This issue is not only related to students' studies, but also to the future of co-education of men and women. After the speech, the meeting adjourned.</p>

However, Comrade Wu is unable to come to the school often due to his heavy workload in the municipal department. Therefore, the general affairs director, Comrade Zhou Yongnan, is also the substitute for the director of moral education. The director of academic affairs, Comrade Huang Zaoxiong, is in charge of rectifying student discipline. Every afternoon, he also convenes students to give a lecture in the role of director of moral education. The language is earnest, and the students are moved by it. In addition, in order to rectify physical education, a teacher-student ball game team has been organized.

<p>Flour Association Telegram to Nanjing Executive Yuan President, Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, and Industry and Commerce Minister: Our country's industry and commerce are bound by tariff treaties and have no room for development. However, reports state that the Sino-Japanese Tariff Treaty Reciprocal Agreement will exchange raw materials for manufactured products. In terms of the flour industry, Japanese flour will be imported as much as possible, and the sales in the three northeastern provinces will be completely occupied. Japanese wheat has no seeds for Chinese factories to use. Reciprocity is an empty word, and Chinese factories will suffer real harm. We urge you to insist that Japanese flour be excluded from the reciprocal treaty and request that the full text of the treaty be disclosed before signing to show great faith and comply with public opinion. We await your orders with anticipation. Shanghai Machine Flour Company Association Chairman Gu Lugui, Sun Jingxi, Rong Zongjin, respectfully.</p>
<p>Machine Federation Telegram to Nanjing National Government, sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, and Finance: Reports state that a new Sino-Japanese treaty is being drafted, and more than 100 types of goods with reciprocal tariff rates have been determined between China and Japan, including cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The Japanese imports are all industrial re-manufactured products, and the Chinese exports are all raw materials. The current situation of the Chinese cotton textile industry is in a critical period. The establishment of this reciprocal treaty will condemn the cotton textile industry to death. It is greatly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Please pay attention to maintain the lifeblood of domestic goods and prevent other countries from following suit. Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, You.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Japanese Ship Causes Another Disaster <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Damaging Chinese Ship. The cargo ship Kakomaru of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, Shanghai-New York route, with a deadweight of over 6,500 tons, departed from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. On the way, due to heavy fog at sea, the ship continued to sound its whistle while sailing and did not stop. On the 24th, the fog at sea had not completely cleared. The Kakomaru ship, in this heavy fog, arrived at the port of Fuzhou, where a Chinese ship named Dongyu was coming. The Japanese ship collided with the hull of the Dongyu ship. Because the Japanese ship was huge and the Dongyu ship was small, the Japanese ship was only slightly damaged after the collision, while the damage to the Chinese ship was very severe. The Japanese ship Kakomaru has now returned to Hong Kong. The Japanese Mail Steamship Company has received a telegram from the ship stating that it needs to be slightly repaired in Hong Kong. As for the details of the damage to the Dongyu, there has been no report by telegram, so it is not clear. A telegram was sent here yesterday to inquire.</p>
<p>Overturning a Civilian Boat The Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Moji-Yokohama route ship Mikasasanmaru, having loaded cargo in Shanghai, set off for Japan. When leaving the port, the company sent a small tugboat, the Jinlingmaru, to tow it out of the port. At that time, there were four cargo barges crossing the bow of the Mikasasanmaru. One of the cargo barges collided with the starboard side of the Mikasasanmaru, and the civilian boat immediately overturned, the cargo was lost, and the boatmen fell into the water. The Japanese ship rescued the people in the water. The Japanese maritime officer stationed in Shanghai agreed to repair the damaged civilian boat and immediately ordered the Mikasasanmaru to continue its voyage to Japan as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Municipal Port Authority Rectifies the Pudong Coastline <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Port Authority has submitted a report to the Municipal Government to rectify the Pudong coastline: "The submission is to report the investigation of the Pudong coastline in this city and to propose rectification methods, requesting review and approval. It is found that only the area of the southern part of the city south of the Huangpu River has previously stipulated rectification methods. The rest of the area north of Puxi is within the concession area and is not easy to start with for a while. The Wusong River coastline is narrow and not suitable for rent, which hinders traffic. However, the Pudong coastline has a very wide area and is under the jurisdiction of this city. Investigation and rectification are urgent. This bureau once sent staff member Wu Zhiyi and surveyor Yuan Baoyan to investigate and measure. After the survey was completed, the survey situation was reported in writing, and a list of Pudong coastline users and a percentage table of the coastline occupied by Chinese and foreign merchants were attached. After reviewing the staff member's report, the Pudong coastline stretches from Zhoujiadu to Qingning Temple, with a total length of 15,460 meters. There are more than 70 merchants, including 31 merchants from British, French, American, and Japanese groups, occupying 66% of the entire coastline. The land used by each merchant is dozens of acres or more, each with its own walls and guards, and there are no roads for passage. The businesses operated by each merchant are mostly wharves, warehouses, docks, shipyards, oil factories, and storage areas. According to Article 12 of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty of the eighth year of Xianfeng in the former Qing Dynasty, British people were allowed to rent land to build houses and warehouses in the trading ports. In addition, Article 6 of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in the 28th year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty stated that China agreed to set up more customs warehouses in the trading ports to store foreign goods. The treaty chapters of the United States and France also stipulate that merchants of those countries can set up warehouses in the trading ports. From the above treaty chapters, it seems that foreign merchants have the possibility of building warehouses in the trading ports. However, the Shanghai British and French Concession Land Regulations state that land rental within the boundary clearly mentions the words 'within the boundary', which means restricting areas outside the boundary. Therefore, foreign merchants should limit themselves to the concession area when building warehouses in trading ports. As for the navigation treaty, the phrase 'China agrees to set up more customs warehouses' indicates that foreign merchants are not allowed to operate their own warehouses, so they requested the establishment of more warehouses in the treaty, which is very clear. The treaty chapter does not specify the wharves. However, the regulations for ships sailing in the inner harbor only allow foreign merchants to rent warehouses, and wharves cannot be built by foreign merchants themselves. Now the Pudong area is not a concession. According to the treaty chapters, foreign merchants are not allowed to build wharves and warehouses. However, illegal construction has become a fact. The only way to remedy this is to manage it and make it comply with the laws and regulations of this city, and then formulate a plan for recovery. The bureau intends to issue the current regulations for citizens renting the coastline separately. All those who have set up wharves and warehouses along the Pudong coast and use the coastline must comply with the regulations. The bureau will sign contracts and collect coastline rental and deposit fees to rectify the situation. In the future, citizens who request to set up warehouses, wharves, and rent the coastline must apply to the bureau for approval. In this way, the past can be rectified and the future can be restricted, and the coastline fee can also increase the city's revenue by about 100,000 yuan per year. All the reasons for the investigation of the Pudong coastline and the proposed rectification methods, along with a copy of the report, a list of Pudong coastline users, a percentage table of the coastline occupied by Chinese and foreign merchants, and a transcript of the full text of each treaty chapter, are hereby submitted to the mayor for review to determine whether they are appropriate. Waiting for instructions. It is heard that after receiving the report, Mayor Zhang instructed the bureau: 'The report is fully understood. The proposed rectification methods for the Pudong coastline can recover sovereignty and increase revenue, so they should be approved. The relevant bureaus should be asked to cooperate and carry out the work diligently. However, the situation of the coastline, as stated in the last item of the report and the last item of the coastline list, regarding Hefeng and Hexing, are clearly different. Please clarify whether this is a typographical error and report back.' This order."</p>

<p>A Total of Three Groups</p>
<p>After a group of overseas Chinese went to Japan on the 5th of this month to seek a living and were expelled back to Shanghai by the Japanese, Chinese people who went to Japan from then on regarded it as a dangerous path. Unexpectedly, in the past few days, there have been three consecutive incidents of the Japanese authorities expelling Chinese people. One group was Chen Shoutong, Lu Haoran, Wu Zuosheng, Zhou Yuanlong, and others who went to the islands under Yokohama Prefecture and Asakusa, etc. One group was Wu Peichuan who went to Nagoya, and one group was Lin Zhongxin, Weng Yizhen, Chen Shimei, and others who went to Moji and Asakusa. Among them, some were prevented from landing because they claimed to be ill, and others were rejected from landing because they did not comply with the entry regulations. All of them have been escorted onto Japanese ships and sent back to Shanghai. Among them, there are people from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, and most of them are in the catering and barber industries.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Vice Commander-in-Chief Yan: "Nanjing Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Taiyuan Vice Commander-in-Chief Yan, reports state that you two have exchanged telegrams, urging each other with righteousness. Although your political views are different, your love for the country is the same. However, rumors arise from nowhere, and gossip spreads, claiming that war is imminent, causing panic and stagnation in commerce, presenting a turbulent situation. Our country has been plagued by disasters for years, and the people's suffering has reached its extreme. Fortunately, you two have worked together to maintain the overall situation. If misunderstandings and rumors become reality, it would not be your original intention. The provinces affected by disasters in recent years are in urgent need of relief, and they are currently requesting funds to rush to carry out spring relief. Planting and cultivation are the only hope for farmers this year. If war breaks out, it will affect all provinces, and if cultivation is missed, the autumn harvest will be hopeless, which will inevitably lead to the whole country becoming disaster areas and all people becoming disaster victims. Even with relief funds, how can we start? Moreover, at a time when the financial situation is chaotic and the whole country is on the verge of bankruptcy? We earnestly request you two to pay attention to the people's livelihood, follow the people's will, work together, and quell the war, so that the dying life of the people across the country will not be extinguished along with the great calamity. We take the liberty to make these statements, filled with trepidation. Please consider it.

<h3 id="e129">Case of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Opinions For and Against Both Sides</p>
<p>Minister Wang's Talk</p>
<p>Minister Wang of the Ministry of Communications, regarding the</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>establishment of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, spoke with reporters from various newspapers, saying: The reporter asked, when will the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau be established? What is the original intention of its establishment and what business will it operate in the future? Can the Minister tell us? The answer is: The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is scheduled to open in Shanghai on March 15. After the establishment of the bureau, the post office will continue to handle matters related to reserve funds and remittances as before. However, the bureau will be specifically responsible for the design, management, supervision, etc., of special savings and remittances. In essence, it is just to introduce banking science into postal savings and remittance affairs. The reason why the government has specifically established a bureau to manage this matter is because the history of postal service in our country, although it has been more than 30 years, and there are already thousands of post offices in the interior, and the annual amount of remittances has exceeded tens of millions, the annual expenditure on remittance discounts alone is as high as more than three million yuan. Although these discounts can be slightly offset by remittance fee income, the postal remittance locations are so extensive that, even if we only consider the domestic remittance part, if we use banking specialization and science for management, the aforementioned expenditure of more than three million yuan, even if it cannot be completely eliminated, can still be reduced to some extent. If managed properly, it can even generate a surplus. The foreign exchange part is even more complicated due to the difference in gold and silver standards. At a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, it cannot be handled well without the participation of banking experts. As for the savings part, in terms of the amount received in the past ten years, there has indeed been some progress. However, if the personnel who have been handling postal savings and remittances are supplemented with the planning of banking experts, its development can be even more limitless. Modern economic undertakings have reached the degree of specialized division of labor and scientification. Postal specialization is not something that only those with banking knowledge can understand, and banking specialization is also difficult for postal personnel to master. The reason why postal services in various countries must specifically establish bureaus for the savings and remittance industries and employ specialized personnel to assist in management is not without reason. In the past 20 years, our country's postal affairs have increased tenfold, and economic surplus and deficit are so subtle, and their changes are extremely drastic. Therefore, the system of post offices concurrently handling savings and remittances is also not allowed by the times. Although a special bureau is established this time, the implementation of savings and remittance affairs still requires the transfer of experienced personnel from post offices to participate in the management, which is also to integrate postal experience and banking experience, so that the postal service can have hope for full development. According to its principle, it is nothing more than adopting the spirit of division of labor economy and scientific economy to adapt to the needs of the times. It is not just copying the established methods of various countries, regardless of the domestic situation. The reporter asked, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union still has doubts about the Savings and Remittance Bureau. Has the Minister read it? The answer is: The Postal Workers' Union's presentation was read in the newspaper before it was submitted to the Ministry. Its content is roughly divided into five points: (A) The post office's savings and remittance business has not yet developed, and there is no need to establish a special bureau. (B) Savings and remittance affairs will be separated from the post office, and management and governance will not be specialized, which will inevitably lead to both sides losing. (C) The Savings and Remittance Bureau has no gold reserves or fund allocation. (D) If remittance and transfer affairs imitate banking methods, it will inevitably cause difficulties for inland post offices. (E) The selection and employment of personnel are not in accordance with the regulations of the postal service. I have carefully read it and am very disappointed. From the first point, savings and remittance affairs cannot be managed without banking specialization, as mentioned above. Handling savings is not just about receiving and paying savings. How to adjust the interest rate, how to distribute the types, and the advantages and disadvantages of its use must all be based on the national economic capacity, market economic trends, and commercial economic conditions for management. Remittance business is not just about issuing remittances. The layout of remittance lines, the consideration of the height of the exchange rate, and the pre-adjustment of the amount of remittance must also be those who are familiar with the market situation and familiar with the domestic and foreign economic and financial conditions to be able to consider surplus and deficit and plan ahead. The achievements of the post office in concurrently handling savings and remittances have also been developing in recent years. If banking experience and financial theory are combined to proceed, there is an immeasurable hope for development. Now it is said that since savings and remittance affairs have not yet developed, there is no need for banking specialization. This is like people in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi years saying that since the affairs of letter offices have not yet developed, there is no need to establish post offices. It is equally ridiculous. From the second point of view, the union obviously misunderstood. After the establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, the business of savings and remittance, in addition to the head office having special responsibility for management, design and operation, is still handled by the post office. Therefore, the Savings and Remittance Bureau and the post office are actually one body. Why is it called separation? Savings and remittance affairs already have a head office to specialize in its responsibility. Why is it called non-specialized governance? Not only that, the profit of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is the profit of the post office, and the budget and final accounts of the Savings and Remittance Bureau are also the budget and final accounts of the entire postal service. The Savings and Remittance Bureau and the Post Office General Bureau are both directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. From the government's perspective, they are both part of handling postal affairs. To say that these affairs were previously managed concurrently by the Post Office General Bureau and could be developed, but now that the Savings and Remittance Bureau is in charge, it cannot be developed, is really incomprehensible. Moreover, the benefits of division of labor and cooperation are recognized by economists. Now it is said to be a situation where both sides will lose, which is unheard of. From the third point of view, the Savings and Remittance Bureau is only handling the affairs of postal savings and remittances. Its funds are still the assets of the entire postal service, which is no different from the time when savings and remittance affairs were subordinate to the Post Office General Bureau. This kind of statement by the union is similar to the result of the separation of the post office and the Savings and Remittance Bureau. The post office and the Savings and Remittance Bureau have not separated, as can be seen in the regulations of the bureau. Article 9 of the Postal Savings Regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government also states that the repayment of postal savings principal and interest is guaranteed by the postal service. The guarantee of postal savings has always been certain. After the establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, there has been no change to this regulation, and there has never been any intention to change it. I don't know why the people in the union are shooting without a target. As for the expenditure of the head office, the annual budget is no more than 100,000 yuan, while the annual discount for postal remittances used to cost up to more than 300,000 yuan. After the establishment of the bureau, if it can reduce this expenditure to one-tenth, it will reach more than 300,000, which is more than enough to cover expenses. Why worry about wasting public funds? From the fourth point of view, domestic remittances, although limited in various circumstances, are unavoidable, but banks often restrict remittances and sometimes even refuse to remit. Now it is said that once a special bureau is established, there will be no restrictions on large amounts of remittances, causing difficulties for inland post offices. It is a misunderstanding of banking economics. Moreover, the personnel who handle remittances in the future will have general planning, coordination, and consideration methods, so there is no need to worry about it. From the fifth point of view, it is more about postal administration, and the union should not make wild guesses. As mentioned earlier, savings and remittance affairs should be managed by banking specialization and postal personnel to assist. Therefore, we have to solicit additional talent. In addition to most of the personnel being transferred from the post office and still receiving postal treatment, those newly hired are not postal personnel. How can we use postal regulations to discipline them? In short, I am in charge of transportation and have the responsibility to innovate the system and benefit the people for all the affairs under my jurisdiction. At the same time, I also value the history of our country's postal service and will never ignore it. The establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is to make postal affairs develop doubly and strive to compete with Europe, America, and Japan. The personnel of the Postal Workers' Union have been serving in the post office for many years and should cherish the cause they are engaged in. Even if there are opinions due to unfamiliar circumstances, they should explain the truth to the Ministry. Now they have published it in the newspaper first, and now they have submitted a presentation to the Ministry, requesting to forward it to the National Government for reconsideration and cancel the previous order. Such interference in administration is really incomprehensible. The Ministry has now criticized it based on reason, and I cannot help but feel sorry for this.</p>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union's Letter to All Circles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union's Letter to All Circles Regarding the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau says: To all compatriots from all walks of life: Our China Post has been in operation for more than 30 years. It has been difficult to create, and it has relied on the efforts of our postal workers to revolutionize and recover the entire postal rights from the hands of imperialism. Only then can we have today's achievements. In China, where all industries are declining, the post office should be the first to win glory for the nation and support the face of the country. However, domestic construction has not been developed for many years, and political changes have not been settled, which has affected the reduction of postal routes, and the number of bureaus in the interior has decreased rather than increased. The scope of the current bureaus has been reduced, and the treatment of workers has been delayed in improving. All these are great obstacles to the development of postal affairs, and tens of thousands of postal workers are racking their brains to find a way out to pray for the bright future and live up to the trust of their compatriots. Unexpectedly, in recent years, all the conspiracies to destroy the post office have been like a spring tide, and they will not stop until the entire post office is submerged and destroyed together. There was the previous traitorous and postal contract of Sino-American Aviation. In the end, our postal workers expressed their indignation, and all circles of society were deeply aware of the righteousness and rose up to awaken. The authorities dared to move and order the cancellation. Now, the ink of opposition has not dried, and the bad news of destruction has arrived again. What is this? It is the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, which will open on March 15. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is named to develop savings and remittances, but in fact it is a butcher's knife for ambitious people to destroy the post office. Compared with the Sino-American contract, although the main body is different between China and foreign countries, the result of destroying the post office is even more cruel and sharp. As for planning the development of savings and remittances, what else can our postal workers say? It is exactly what we are bowing our heads and seeking. However, the way of development should be urgent first and then slow, and it is appropriate to consolidate the foundation first, and then flourish the branches and leaves. Our country's savings and remittance business has not yet developed, so we must first seek improvement and gradually seek development, so that the scope will be expanded day by day and the foundation will be consolidated. Then, for the convenience of management, divide the management and determine the number of bureaus to be established according to the size of the business scope. All countries in Europe, America, and Japan are the same. At the beginning, how should we first seek improvement from the business itself, which is the way to first consolidate the foundation? If we are ignorant of the construction procedures, but only to Europe, America, and Japan, which have been created by decades of hard work, Huang Huang is eager for success and is curious, and wants to reach it once in China, which is very poor, this person is either very stupid, or has another intention. It will be seen that the roots are not firm, and the branches, leaves, and tree itself are withered. The day when the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is established is the day when the great post office will be destroyed. The lesson of the past of Sino-American Aviation can be learned. Can we not be horrified? According to today's newspaper, the Minister of Communications told people that the Savings and Remittance Bureau is only responsible for special savings and remittance design, and ordinary savings and remittance business is still handled by the post office, etc. If we want to separate the Savings and Remittance Bureau, why not transfer all the savings and remittance affairs to the head office? This kind of makeshift problem is self-evident, and false words are used to cover up. Now, I tell the authorities that if you do not want the post office to be destroyed, please stop the establishment, so as not to repeat the same mistakes as the Sino-American Aviation contract. If you must go your own way and act arbitrarily, then Chairman Chiang's strict order to reduce the over-needed organs has just been issued, and the party discipline is strict, and the national law is unavoidable. At this time, please do not make the dream of stealing the country again. The association is anxious and distressed, sad and screaming, for the post office and for the country, and does not care about it. I would like to sincerely announce it, and hope that all compatriots from all walks of life will pay attention to their interests and rise up to plan it together. Sincerely, Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, February 26.</p>

<p>French Consul General Gangelin officially replied to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the stamp tax, saying: On the 8th of this month, I received your letter regarding the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau's plan to promote stamps in the French Concession. After checking, if this matter is in accordance with the regulations stipulated in the letter from the leader Consul General to the former Jiangsu Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs on November 7 last year, there is no obstacle to promoting stamps in the concession. In addition to the fact that this Consul General is now planning to determine the necessary measures with Mr. Wang (translation), I will promote it again. This is to inform you for your reference.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Municipal Health Bureau Strictly Prohibits Illegal Gratuities <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has discovered that shops have the illegal practice of giving gratuities to health inspectors. In addition to sending the health inspectors who received illegal gratuities to the Public Security Bureau for investigation according to Wang's law, it also issued a public notice yesterday, roughly saying: (1) The bureau's field staff and health inspectors are only responsible for abiding by the scope and undertaking investigation or guidance matters. The investigation or guidance situation must be reported back to the bureau. If the matter is more important, the bureau will send personnel to review it separately. If the public is not harmed, the bureau will never be demanding. The investigation or guidance personnel have no possibility of covering up or making things difficult. If you try to do so with illegal gratuities or bribes, it will not only be completely in vain, but also lose your personality because of such base behavior. (2) Even those who should be detained and punished out of necessity, the bureau must notify the competent district of the Public Security Bureau with an official document for execution, or take them to the bureau for interrogation. The bureau's field staff has no right to dispose of it freely. In addition, the fines received by the bureau or the various districts of the Public Security Bureau, no matter how much, must be filled out with an official receipt with the official bureau seal and given to the person being fined. If this official receipt is not filled out, it is illegal. You can report it to the Public Security Bureau and its districts or to this bureau to prevent Changming's extortion and facilitate the investigation of various agencies. (3) If anyone pretends to be a health official and demands money from the public, please be responsible for reporting it or handing it over to the guard police, and report it to the bureau immediately for investigation according to law. (4) This bureau has always taken corruption as a major taboo for its staff. If dereliction of duty is found, it will never be shielded. I hope the public will report it at any time based on the facts and be careful not to slander, so as not to violate Article 180 of the Criminal Law of false accusation. (5) Both giving and receiving bribes are illegal acts. Articles 128 and 129 of the Criminal Law have clearly stipulated the crimes. In the future, if anyone gives illegal gratuities or bribes to the personnel of this bureau, they will be reported to the court for punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Instruction to Abolish the Baojia System <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government previously received an order from the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, stating that the Baojia system in various counties in Jiangsu Province has more disadvantages than advantages. We should immediately verify whether it should be abolished. The former County Chief Lu, because the procedures for land measurement and valuation in this county have not yet been completed, and it is difficult to abolish it at present, presented it to the Civil Affairs Department for review. Now, Minister of Civil Affairs Miao found that the counties have different opinions on the preservation and abolition of the Baojia. He immediately submitted it to the Provincial Government Committee meeting for approval. It should be abolished uniformly. All the original duties of the Baojia should be managed by the township chief's office, etc. The Shanghai County Government has already received instructions from the Civil Affairs Department to the county, ordering immediate compliance with the abolition. Therefore, County Chief Leng has already instructed the County Finance Bureau and all districts to comply with it.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Unification of the Value of Foreign Coins for Tram and Bus Fares in the North and South Municipalities <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The trams and buses in the Chinese and Concession areas of this city have slightly suppressed the price of foreign coins according to the market price. The transportation companies in the North and South Municipalities have different prices for foreign coins, which are not uniform. A few days ago, the Municipal Executive Committee and the Jiangwan Branch of the Businessmen's Association sent letters to the Municipal Public Works Bureau one after another, asking them to transfer the order to the Chinese Public Bus Company to charge passengers with double coins or auxiliary coin coupons at market prices, and not to deliberately suppress them. The bureau then divided and ordered the companies concerned to discuss a unified method and submit it for approval. Subsequently, the China Merchant Electric Company, the China Merchant Public Bus Company, and the Hুনan Public Bus Company jointly replied with the reasons why coins and auxiliary coin coupons could not be used at market prices, which were roughly: (1) Most of the trams are short-distance, and less than 10% of passengers buy tickets of more than ten points. The highest fare for buses does not exceed two coins. The fares are trivial, and the time is short. If all passengers use copper coins to buy tickets, the ticket sellers are already overwhelmed. If coins are added, they need to find copper coins and identify the silver color, which is difficult to handle. Moreover, the stations are close to each other. To avoid missing tickets, it will inevitably delay the journey, which is detrimental to public transportation companies and business. Therefore, lowering the price of coins is a passive remedy, aimed at reducing the use of foreign coins, which is completely different from deliberately suppressing the price for trickery. (2) Recently, counterfeit lead coins are rampant. It is still the second thing that the ticket seller is negligent and deceived during the hasty receipt. It is especially worried that this will cause disputes, such as disputes over authenticity and errors in delivery. These are all worthy of consideration. Moreover, according to the average calculation of the fare, if one out of ten passengers buys a ticket with double coins, the fare paid by the other nine passengers is only enough for one person to find. If coins are used at market prices, passengers will use coins to buy tickets to avoid the trouble of carrying and exchanging copper coins. The burden is great. Moreover, the market price varies, and disputes are inevitable. (3) Trams have been running in the Chinese area for more than ten years, and buses have also been around for many years. Passengers have been accustomed to preparing the fare copper coins in advance when taking the bus. Moreover, there are many money shops in this port, and they are close to the stations, which are eye-catching and very convenient for exchange. Therefore, passengers have not felt the pain of suppressed prices or any difficulties in fact. It is also said that the price of coins on the concession tram is the same as in the Chinese area, and the length of the line and the number of passengers are twice that of the Chinese area. The reason why no one has risen up to question is that they all know the difficulties of the transportation business and the special circumstances and understand and sympathize with each other. Based on these reasons, the company and others publicly planned to fix one coin at 20 copper coins and one auxiliary coin coupon at 24 copper coins, so as to meet the purpose of collecting fewer coins. It is now learned that the bureau has verified that the reason is legitimate and the price is fair. It has approved it for record and has sent letters to the Municipal Executive Committee and the Jiangwan Branch of the Businessmen's Association to inform them.</p>

<p>Distributed to Attending Representatives of the Sixth Municipal Congress</p>
<p>The Sixth Municipal Congress of this city is scheduled to be held on the 31st of this month. A few days ago, the Municipal Government approved a letter from the Municipal Executive Committee requesting the submission of the Municipal General Report for the 18th year and the policy guidelines for this year's administration to the Congress. Instructions have been issued to the various bureaus under its jurisdiction to prepare them by a specified date. It is now learned that the Municipal Government has compiled and printed the municipal report into a booklet, and has also included working reports from various bureaus, various attached tables, and municipal government gazettes and other printed materials, which will be distributed to the attending representatives for review and correction, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e137">American Residents Plan to Contest for Board of Directors of the Public Works Department <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Proposed to Hold a Mock Election First</p>
<p>The Ta Wan Pao reports: Since Ms. Smith, the American Commercial Commissioner, was nominated as a candidate for the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, it has stirred up a political competition among the expatriates in the Public Concession. When the news of Ms. Smith's candidacy was announced last Saturday, the American residents of this port were shocked by this unprecedented news of a woman running for election in Shanghai, as if by a sudden thunderclap. After recovering from the shock, in addition to the originally nominated Mr. Carney and Reverend Burden, they further nominated Mr. Tucker, the longest-serving broker in Shanghai, as the third male candidate to compete against her. How the election will ultimately turn out is difficult to predict at this point. However, it is heard that there is an organization among the American residents that intends to find a way to inform all concession voters of their two preferred candidates. If this is not done, it is feared that nine out of ten of the four American candidates will be defeated. Therefore, these people intend to hold an informal vote first, which is scheduled to take place at the meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in the American Club on Friday. The two candidates who receive the most votes will be considered the people that the American residents prefer to be elected. Then, they will disclose this to the newspapers to indirectly inform the voters of all countries. Otherwise, the two candidates with fewer votes will automatically withdraw from the election. Apart from this, there is no other way to save them from defeat. Because there are already eight British candidates and two Japanese candidates. If the American residents nominate four more candidates, it is feared that none of the four will be able to be elected in the future.</p>

<p>To All Newspapers: In the counties of Shan, Jianbao, and Luoyang in western Henan, we have suffered years of drought, coupled with banditry, resulting in countless people starving, displaced, and dying. Those who are fortunate enough to survive are also in extreme distress beyond words. Last winter, we were fortunate to have the Red Swastika Society establish porridge kitchens, which allowed us to barely survive. However, the disaster area is vast and there are many disaster victims. Even with the efforts of one association, it is ultimately difficult to reach everyone. Therefore, we humbly request all the great philanthropists in various ports to show great compassion and generously provide disaster relief, so that the remaining lives of the fortunate survivors will not end up in the realm of hungry ghosts. The merit and virtue of this act are immeasurable. We also earnestly request the newspapers to appeal on our behalf. We are overcome with gratitude and humbly beseech you.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Inheritance Dispute After the Death of Fang Danchi <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Many Gold Leaves and Gold Pounds Involved</p>
<p>Both Sides Sue Each Other in Three Cases</p>
<p>The Three Cases Have Progressed One After Another</p>
<p>Fang Danchi, a close relative of Fang Benren, passed away in Shanghai last autumn. The movable property he left behind is estimated to be worth about 200,000 gold. In addition, there were gold leaves and gold pounds, worth more than 4,000 yuan, which had disappeared without a trace. Later, Danchi's son, Dacheng, found that his father's concubine, Deng, and servant, Wang Dahan, had stolen them and handed them over to Deng Guannan, his father's friend, who in turn gave them to Wang Shutang for joint embezzlement. He demanded their return, but they refused. Later, because he had to escort the coffin back to his hometown, he had no time to continue the investigation. Until last December, Deng Guannan suddenly came to Shanghai from Hankou. Dacheng feared that he had come to Shanghai to withdraw money from the bank, so he followed him. Before long, Deng's daughter also came to Shanghai from Hankou. Dacheng then hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to sue Deng and his daughter, as well as the two Wangs, in the Provisional Court for stealing the inheritance. To prevent Deng Guannan from escaping, he lived in the same Hongkou Hotel as Deng. Unexpectedly, Deng reported to the Hongkou police that Fang Dacheng had engaged in kidnapping. The detective chief sent detectives to arrest Fang. After explaining the situation, he was detained for several hours for no reason. Therefore, Fang also entrusted his agent lawyer Zhan Jifeng to further accuse Deng and his daughter of fabricating false accusations. Deng Guannan also, through his agent lawyer, filed a lawsuit accusing Fang Dacheng and Fang's fifth uncle, Fang Fengchi, as well as Hu Hanqing, Zhou Shanbang, and others, of illegal detention and obstructing freedom. The case has already been heard once.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Fang Dacheng's Lawsuit for Theft <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Unable to Enter the Sickroom Frequently Yesterday afternoon, the scheduled hearing continued. The defendant, Wang Shutang, surrendered himself to the police and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. Wang Dahan, Hu Hanqing, and Zhou Shanbang, the other defendants, did not appear. Soon, Judge Luo Renji ascended to the 14th Court and announced that the three lawsuits filed by both parties should be heard, starting with Fang Dacheng's lawsuit for theft. According to the plaintiff, Fang Dacheng, after my father fell ill, Deng Jin alienated the relationship between my father and son, so I was unable to enter the sickroom frequently. Only Deng and Wang Dahan were at my father's side.</p>
<p>Stealing Gold Pounds and Gold Leaves From July 21 to August 3 last year, when my father was critically ill, they stole the gold pounds and gold leaves in the iron box and all the passbooks and vouchers in the leather bag. Deng took the gold items to the room of her father, Deng Guannan, downstairs, and Guannan took them to Bao Lingfeng's house and gave them to Wang Shutang to take away.</p>
<p>More Than 300,000 Gold During His Lifetime Fang Fengchi testified that when my brother passed away, I received a letter in Hankou and arrived in Shanghai on August 6. There are seven brothers in my family, and we have not yet divided the family property, which is jointly owned and managed by Danchi. The various current and fixed deposits amounted to about 200,000 yuan, and the real estate was no less than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Only a Few Hundred Gold After His Death After Danchi's death, there were only four deposit books with deposits of only three or four hundred yuan. The rest was gone. When Danchi was ill, Deng and Wang Dahan handled most of the withdrawals.</p>
<p>It Is Difficult to Investigate the Deposits When I arrived in Shanghai, I learned that there was no cash at home, and funds were needed for the funeral. I planned to take the gold pounds and gold leaves, so I opened the iron box, but they were gone. I asked Deng, who said she had taken them. I also had Wang Shutang mortgage the tobacco leaf bill of lading. I also investigated the deposits, but my brother usually stored them under other names, so it was difficult to investigate, and so on.</p>
<p>Keeping Gold Pounds and Gold Leaves Also, Bao Zhenpeng, the nephew of the witness Bao Lingfeng, testified that Wang Shutang came to my house at 1:00 PM on August 5 last year, and then Deng Guannan also came and gave the gold items to Wang, asking him to keep them. After inspection, there were 80 gold pounds and a package of gold leaves, about 10 taels. This is what I saw, and there was nothing else, and so on.</p>
<p>Mortgaging Gold Pounds to a Coffin Shop When asked, the defendant Wang Shutang confessed that he was a friend of Danchi. On the day of his death, his family asked me to buy clothes and a coffin for him. The next day, Deng took 88 gold pounds and gold leaves to Bao's house and asked me to keep them. On the 11th of this month, because the 455 yuan for the coffin had not been paid, I temporarily mortgaged the gold pounds to the Jufeng Wood Shop at the Xin Matou in Nanshi, which sold the coffin. On the 12th, the funds from the tobacco leaf mortgage were made, and I took back the gold pounds and returned them to Deng and his daughter. The gold leaves were also returned. I do not know whether the gold items were given to Deng by Danchi or taken privately by Liu Deng.</p>
<p>The Gold Pounds Can Be Investigated Lawyer Zhan immediately presented various documents, bills, and coffin purchase invoices to prove that Wang Shutang's confession could not be believed, and said that the gold pounds and gold leaves were not temporarily mortgaged to Jufeng. This can be investigated, and so on.</p>
<p>My Husband Gave Me the Gold Pounds Deng also confessed that the gold items were given to her by her husband in May or June last year because she had sold her gold jewelry before and she had argued with him, so he gave her the gold pounds, etc. When her husband passed away, her sixth uncle, Hechi, wanted to claim the gold items, and Dacheng even wanted to search for them, so she and her father sent them to Bao's house and asked Wang to keep them. Later, Wang returned the original items. Deng Guannan's confession about the gold items was roughly the same as his daughter's.</p>
<p>A Card Written in His Own Hand While Ill Fang Fengchi believed that Deng and others' statements that his brother had sold the lady's jewelry were completely inaccurate. He presented evidence to prove that his family had a lot of current deposits at that time, and his brother would never have sold the jewelry. He also presented a card, saying that the card was written in Danchi's own hand while ill, listing the amount of deposits in various places, totaling more than 60,000 gold. He also said that Deng had previously confessed to 36 gold pounds, but now she said 80 gold pounds. He requested an investigation to determine the exact number.</p>

<p>The Father and Daughter Accuse Me of Kidnapping In the second hearing of Fang Dacheng's lawsuit accusing Deng and his daughter of false accusation, Fang stated that on February 7, Deng reported to the Hongkou police that he had kidnapped her, which resulted in Chinese and Western detectives coming to arrest him and inflict torture on him. He was first detained at the Hongkou police station and then escorted to the Huisi police station. After I explained the situation, I was released. Before reporting to the police, Deng had gone to the Hongkou Hotel to meet with her father, so it was actually a conspiracy between the father and daughter.</p>
<p>Police Detectives Testify A detective from the Hongkou police station, No. 17, testified that Deng and her representative lawyer went to the police station to report, and I asked the lawyer, who said that the accusation was illegal detention, so I went to arrest Fang. I did not hear the word kidnapping at the time.</p>
<p>The Question of Reporting to the Police and Kidnapping When asked, Deng confessed that she reported to the police that Dacheng had illegally detained my father, and I had never discussed it with my father beforehand. Deng Guannan said that my daughter came to Shanghai because I summoned her in a letter, but I did not know about her reporting to the police at first. At that time, lawyer Zhan said that Deng had indeed mentioned kidnapping when reporting to the police. Please investigate the records of the police station. The court approved it.</p>

<p>Monitoring His Actions After Arriving in Shanghai In the final hearing of Deng Guannan's lawsuit for obstructing freedom, Deng stated that after arriving in Shanghai, Fang's uncle and nephew, as well as Hu Hanqing and Zhou Shanbang, searched his luggage, took away his travel expenses, and monitored his actions. The two parties denied all of his accusations and responded to each accusation.</p>
<p>The hearing had lasted for six hours. Judge Luo ordered the defendants to continue to be released on bail by their lawyers and adjourned the hearing to March 5.</p>

<p>Tang Wenzao, a Member of the Kidnapping Gang</p>
<p>Related to the Yan Zizhang Case</p>
<p>Yan Went to Hong Kong and Did Not Appear in Court</p>
<p>The Case Was Adjourned Again for Retrial</p>
<p>Yang Kuihou, a native of Huzhou, residing at No. 821 North Zhejiang Road, was a compradore at the Andar Bank on Jiujiang Road. On the night of the 10th of last month, Yang went to the home of a prostitute named Hua Xiangrong in Qunyu Lane, Yunnan Road, for entertainment. After leaving, he took his own car, No. 804, to go home. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly threatened by several kidnappers with weapons, who drove the chauffeur down and drove Yang away, intending to demand a large ransom. Later, Jin Yangwu and Ma Xiaozhi, Chinese detectives from the General Investigation Department of the General Inspectorate of the Patrol Police, and Western detectives Bai and Tan, arrested the kidnappers Wang Caixi, Lu Weiting, Chen Deshan, Han Xiaowuzi, Zhang Yaosheng, Cheng Dequan, Lu Changqing, Tang Wenzao, and the women Wang Lu, Song Xiaomei, Deng Li, and others at No. 905-and-a-half Yongqin Lane, Kader Road, and Room 454 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, respectively. They also rescued the hostage Yang Kuihou at the house of Deng Li on Kader Road and confiscated guns and ammunition. They were escorted to the Provisional Court for interrogation, as reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>The Police Further Accuse Tang Wenzao Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Zhou Xianjue ascended to the First Court for a continued hearing. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, presented the case and stated that they were now further accusing Tang Wenzao of being involved in the case of the kidnapping of Yan Zizhang, the owner of the Zhenxiang Candy Store on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession, by a gang on July 17 last year. Please investigate.</p>
<p>Cheng Dequan's Confession The plaintiff, Yang Kuihou, hired lawyer Song Mingdong. The defendants also hired lawyers Fan Gang, Wu Zhiping, Liu Hongyu, and others to defend them. Chief Judge Zhou then called the defendant Cheng Dequan to testify. Cheng Dequan said that he was working on the Zhaoshangju Xinmin steamboat. Cheng Keming told me that he had just bought a car and wanted to hire a chauffeur. I asked Lu Changqing to go, but Lu did not go, so I asked Tang Wenzao to go instead. Later, I was arrested at Cheng Keming's place, Room 454 of the Huizhong Hotel.</p>
<p>The Patrol Police Abandoned Their Posts and Fled Lawyer Gan then said that after the defendants were arrested, they were all detained at the police station. A Chinese patrol officer, No. 1831, secretly communicated information to the defendant Chen Deshan. The detective chief discovered this and searched Chen's house, confiscating several pawn tickets. The patrol officer has now abandoned his post and fled, and so on.</p>
<p>The Yan Case Involves Tang Wenzao Lu Changqing confessed that he recommended Tang Wenzao to Feng (i.e., Cheng Keming) to drive because of Cheng Dequan's introduction. He did not know about the kidnapping. Police lawyer Gan also said that after Yan Zizhang was kidnapped last year, the police had arrested two suspects, Li Afu and others, who confessed that the driver was Tang Wenzao. The police had issued an arrest warrant for Tang. When Tang was arrested, he also admitted to receiving 1,500 yuan in foreign currency at the police station. There is now a witness in court, but Yan Zizhang has gone to Hong Kong today and cannot be present.</p>
<p>An Incident After Returning from the Dance Hall Zhu Shiwei testified that he was an employee of the Zhenxiang Candy Store. Yan Zizhang, I, and Miss Qi were sitting in car No. 10086, returning from dancing at the Paris Restaurant on Yuyuan Road. When passing the entrance of the Datong Hotel, three bandits suddenly jumped into the car, threatened us with guns, and drove us down. Yan was then kidnapped. However, we were all drunk at the time, so we could not identify the faces of the kidnappers.</p>
<p>Tang Wenzao Denies Driving Tang Wenzao also testified, whose nickname is Tao Xiaolaoji. On that day, I met a Cheng (i.e., Dequan) wearing a leather coat on Kader Road, who asked me to drive an empty car to the No. 101 workshop on Aiwanyi Road. Kidnapping</p>
<p>It was not me who drove at the time, and so on. Chief Judge Zhou verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody separately and adjourned the retrial to a later date.</p>

<p>Detectives Negotiate on the Phone</p>
<p>All Extortion Letters Are Delivered by the Bandits Themselves</p>
<p>How Do the Bandits Know Song Shuying?</p>
<p>Her Cousin Is Involved</p>
<p>Yao Yinfo, a native of Huzhou, residing at No. 208 Chunhua Lane, Meibaige Road, is a clerk at Zhu Sifu's law firm. He has been married to Ms. Song Shuying for more than ten years. Since the 19th of this month, he has received a series of letters from bandits, a total of five, some addressed to Yao and some to Song, and the content is all about demanding 1,000 yuan. Yao then sent the letters to the Xin Zha Police Station, which had jurisdiction over the area, and asked them to investigate. Because the letters he received were all sent to the door by bandits and thrown through the door slits, he expected them to continue to do so. Therefore, the police chief sent detectives Zhou Guisheng and Ma Zhonglai to Yao's house on the 24th of this month to station there. That afternoon, the telephone at Yao's house rang loudly. Detective Ma picked up the phone. At first, he heard the other party asking if the person on the phone was Song Shuying. Ma said yes. He also asked if the previous letter had been received. Ma knew that it was the bandit on the phone, so he replied that it had been read. Then, he began to negotiate. Ma told him that the family was not wealthy and could only afford three or four hundred gold, otherwise it would be difficult to raise the money. The person on the other end said that if they were sincere in negotiating, they could put a red paper with the amount written on it on the door of their house, and there would be a letter the next day to arrange a meeting place. After saying this, the phone rang again, and the conversation ended. Ma ordered Yao's family to do as agreed and reported back to the police station. On the 25th (the day before), at 8:00 AM, Ma went to Yao's house again and learned that the bandit had thrown a letter there, which stated that they would talk again in the afternoon, and so on. Waiting until 6:30 PM, another letter was thrown through the door slit of Yao's house. Ma immediately opened the door and saw one</p>
<p>person running away. He chased after him. Detective Zhou Guisheng and Detective Zong Weiting also arrived to assist in the chase. The person fled to Taiping Lane and went straight into the house at No. 10. He was chased and captured by Chinese patrol officer No. 127 of the Third Squad and Western patrol officer No. 242 and taken to the police station. He confessed his name as Xu Er, a native of Shanghai, and was taken into custody. It was then learned that Xu did not know Yao's address at first, so his initial extortion letters were mistakenly thrown into the house of Zhao Xu, a woman at No. 209 Qingdao Road. The woman's family was poor and knew that they were not qualified to be scammed, so she ignored it. Later, because she received three consecutive letters, she had to take the letters to the police station to report them. Ma and others verified that the handwriting was the same as that on the letters received by Yao, and the names were also the same. Therefore, it was suspected that the bandit had thrown them by mistake. Yesterday morning, Xu and the letters were escorted to the Provisional Court. Judge Luo Renji conducted a preliminary hearing. After the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, presented the case, he requested an adjournment. Then, Yao Yinfo and his wife came to court to testify about what had happened. Yao also said that his wife's name was Song Shuying, which few outsiders knew. How the bandit knew it was difficult to figure out, and so on. When asked, Xu Er confessed that I was studying at a certain school. This matter was initiated by a cousin of Song Shuying, and I wrote the letters and delivered them four times on his behalf. Judge Luo ordered the defendant to be held in custody and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Li Zhaoquan Sentenced to Seven Years</p>
<p>Li Jingnan Sentenced to Nine Years for Two Crimes</p>
<p>After the robbery at the home of Li Zhaobing, a Cantonese native at No. 2017 North Sichuan Road, Feng Qi, a detective from the Hongkou police station, arrested the victim's nephew, Li Zhaoquan, and the Cantonese natives Li Jingnan and Xu Er, and escorted them to the Provisional Court for investigation, as reported in the previous newspaper. According to the investigation by Detective Feng and Deputy Western Detective Bailisi, Li Zhaoquan was only involved in this case, while Li Jingnan was also involved in the armed robbery of a certain family at No. 768 Wuchang Road by a gang on November 20 of last year. A search was conducted at Li Jingnan's house, No. 18 Gongjiazhai, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and a pistol and 116 bullets were confiscated. Two leather jackets and a gold-inlaid jade bracelet were also retrieved from the Baohe Pawnshop on North Sichuan Road, which Li Zhaobing identified as the original stolen goods. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to court for a continued hearing. The police lawyer stated that there was no relationship with Xu Er and requested permission to withdraw the charges against Xu. However, Xu was ill and had been sent to the hospital for treatment. When asked, Li Zhaoquan confessed that he accompanied the gang to rob his uncle's house and that he was a lookout outside the door. Li Jingnan admitted that he received 120 yuan in foreign currency for the two cases. As for the guns and ammunition, he said that they were stored by a friend. Judge Tan sentenced Li Zhaoquan to seven years in prison and Li Jingnan to nine years in prison for two robbery charges and one charge of illegal possession of firearms. The guns and ammunition were confiscated, and the stolen goods were returned to the original owner. Xu Er was released because he was not involved.</p>

<p>A Dispute Leads to a Homicide</p>
<p>A villager named Feng Jincai from the 80th Tu of the 21st Bao in the southwest township of Benyi was strolling outside his door a few days ago when he suddenly saw a young woman leading a six- or seven-year-old girl and a one-year-old boy crying as they passed by. Feng then struck up a conversation. The woman said that she had quarreled with her husband and had left home and did not want to go back. Feng then had inappropriate thoughts. Since he did not have a wife, he invited her to live in his house. Three days later, Xu Asi from Minhang came and claimed that he lived in the Xiaozhi Yangquan area of the Xu family in northern Minhang and that the woman was his wife. He accused Feng of abduction. Feng defended himself, saying that she had come on her own. Xu ordered him to hand over the abducted person and left after a dispute. However, Xu did not take his wife away. Unexpectedly, before the dispute was resolved, the woman suddenly vomited and had diarrhea the night before and died. Feng Jincai was greatly alarmed because one thing had not been resolved and another thing had happened. He reported it to the District Office, which ordered the local bailiff Cao Yunsheng to report it to the Local Court for inspection.</p>

<p>Two Women Die by Poisoning</p>
<p>A prisoner died of illness in the hospital attached to the Tilanqiao Western Prison in Hongkou. On the 25th, at 2 p.m., one prisoner died of illness. The Xinzha Police Station, which originally handled matters at the hospital, dispatched officers to carry the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Avenue Foch, and reported to the Provisional Court. Judge Ge Sixun was commissioned to arrive at the office at 11 a.m. yesterday for examination and official investigation. According to the complaint filed by the Deputy Chief of the Xinzha Police Station, the deceased, named He Peiqing, was arrested for writing threatening letters and extortion. After being interrogated by the court, he was sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment. He had been in custody for about two years and recently contracted tuberculosis. He died on the afternoon of the previous day. No family members were found. Upon hearing the report, Judge Ge determined that the deceased had indeed died of illness. As no family members were found, the body was handed over to the Pushan Public Charity for coffin and burial.</p>
<p>Death by Smoking Opium</p>
<p>Wu Hu, the wife of Wu Shengzhi, a native of Anhui residing at No. 597 Xing Shun Li, Hejian Road, Yangshupu, committed suicide by swallowing opium because of financial difficulties on the afternoon of the previous day. Wu discovered this and was trying to find a way to save her when Chinese Constable No. 1649, who oversees the area, learned of it and reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. Police officers were dispatched to transport Wu Hu by vehicle to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but she died. The hospital notified the police station, who carried the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Avenue Foch. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Provisional Court, and Judge Ge Shixun arrived to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased had indeed died from swallowing opium. After the official investigation began, Wu Shengzhi testified that he was from Anhui and had always studied, but failed to find employment in Shanghai. He was in financial difficulties, and his wife's work was not enough to make a living, so she committed suicide. He had no money for a coffin and burial and would need to seek help from his fellow villagers. Upon hearing the report, Judge Ge instructed Wu to sign a pledge to claim the body for coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Ma Guisheng, a 30-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 32 Gaoshou Li, Haining Road, was employed at the Reiss &amp; Co. on Rue de Ningpo. His wife, Wang, was 23 years old, also from Suzhou. The couple had a quarrel over trivial matters the previous morning. Ma then went to his office. After work, he saw his wife lying in bed. She did not eat that evening. Ma thought that family disputes were common, so he ignored it. They slept in the same bed that night. However, Ma woke up at midnight and heard his wife moaning and vomiting. Ma turned on the light and saw that his wife looked pale. When the landlord and others arrived after being alerted, they questioned her and learned that she had swallowed a box of matches. They hired a streetcar to take her to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, the poison had penetrated deep into her organs, and treatment was ineffective. She died at around 5 a.m.</p>

<p>"Ci Pu" (詞譜), in 40 volumes, was officially compiled in the 54th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. It includes more than 820 tunes and 2,300 forms, arranged in order of the number of characters. The punctuation and rhyming are indicated in small characters below the words. The tones of each character, whether level or oblique, or whether level or oblique are allowed, are marked with symbols next to the characters. The origins of the names of various lyrics, the level and oblique tones of melodies, the differences in sentence structure, and the suites of large pieces are all researched extensively and authoritatively. This allows scholars to follow the rules and provides a comprehensive collection of Ci poetry. If we can use this to determine the rules of Ci poetry and discuss the musical modes, we may be able to obtain the lost musical chapters and restore the old music of Dasheng. Therefore, those who write Ci poetry today must follow the words and sentences determined by the score, distinguish their level and oblique tones, and further divide the level tones into those replaced by entering tones and those replaced by rising tones, and divide the oblique tones into those suitable for rising, falling, or entering tones. Only then can it be considered a complete Ci poetry that can be scored for musical instruments, harmonizing with jade flutes, red teeth, Qin zithers, and Yan reeds in singing and dancing venues. However, this book is rarely circulated and cannot be obtained for less than 200 yuan. Now there is a lithographic edition, priced at only 10 yuan per copy. If you want to view a sample, please send a letter to the Medical Bookstore at No. 121 Meibai Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>If your lover gets angry, don't talk to them. Because when you talk at this time, the feelings of both parties are most likely to break down.</p>
<p>Women's love of beauty is more intense than that of men. In fact, men's love of beauty even surpasses that of women.</p>
<p>The most terrifying woman on the stage of love is a woman who embraces romanticism. Because they most like to play with men.</p>
<p>Although divorce is agreed upon by both husband and wife, in fact, in one hundred divorce cases, there are several cases where the husband or wife is passive.</p>
<p>People who value reputation and morality cannot experience life in prison.</p>
<p>Only when the body becomes frail does one realize the joy of a strong and healthy time.</p>
<p>In court cases involving human life, apart from theft and robbery, most are cases of adultery between men and women. This shows the harm of lust.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Discovery of Hidden Gold in Huzhou <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiao</p>
<p>The discovery of hidden gold is often seen in newspapers. Most of them are untrue or incomplete. What I am recording now is particularly credible and substantiated. The person speaking is an eyewitness. The event is not far from today. It happened on Clothing Street in Huzhou. Initially, since the beginning of the Political Tutelage, all major cities have been engaged in municipal construction. Huzhou is no exception. It specially renovated the streets inside and outside the city, and uniformly widened them to facilitate pedestrians. As a result, nine out of ten shops and residences on the street had to be demolished and moved back a few feet. There were hundreds of road construction workers. The sounds of shovels were loud. This work was praised by some and complained about by others. This is a major local policy, which is unrelated to this topic, so I won't say too much. I should record the unusual discovery of hidden gold. There was a cloth shop called Zhengfeng on Clothing Street. Its storefront was also in the demolition zone. On the original site of the Zhengfeng shop, a worker dug down with a hoe. Suddenly, he hit a hard object. Upon inspection, it was a mud ball. Removing the dirt, it revealed a glittering golden color. It was a Yuanbao! He couldn't help but be overjoyed. Other workers all gathered upon hearing the sound. They passed it around and looked at it. It was indeed a pure gold Yuanbao. They thought there must be more than one. They dug further at the spot. They successively dug up sixteen silver ones and twelve gold ones. Each weighed several dozen taels. They were all engraved with the words "Yuanfeng." It is unknown what year they were lost. The workers suddenly acquired this unexpected windfall. They all thought of taking possession. They kept fighting each other. It almost led to disaster. Fortunately, there was a Lu Zhonglian who came out to mediate. He distributed them according to their names. Only then did they happily share the loot and finish the matter. The discovery of hidden gold seems strange but is not surprising. It must have been buried by someone first, and then discovered by someone later. It is not creating something from nothing. Only superstitious people might regard it as a gift from the God of Wealth. As a result, they become even more flattering to the gods. They think hard and try their best, hoping to gain something. In fact, in history, there have been many rebellions. Rich families often buried their wealth before fleeing from disaster. It is truly a case of "no place is without treasure." The opportunity to discover it is also something that can only be encountered and not sought. After the discovery of gold and silver Yuanbao on Clothing Street in Huzhou, workers constructing roads on other streets at the same time suddenly had delusions. Therefore, I explain it by analogy.</p>

<p>— Meng Qi</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's hard to go out for even a moment." Indeed, going out is not an easy thing. The following is something I personally experienced. Writing it down may serve as a warning to those who have not yet been deceived.</p>
<p>When the Yangtze River steamer arrived in Shanghai, we were busy disembarking. Because there were several people traveling together, we agreed to put our luggage together. When we arrived at the pier, a tout from a certain inn suddenly rushed in. Without asking for permission, he grabbed our belongings and ran away. He gave us a copper tag, saying that we could use this tag to retrieve our belongings at the inn. Since our belongings had already been taken away, there was no way to stop him. We had no choice but to listen to him. He then called a carriage for us and took us to the inn.</p>
<p>We had to let him do as he pleased in order to get our belongings back. When we arrived at the inn, we saw that there were quite a few fellow sufferers. We knew that this would be a big rip-off. One person who brought two items was charged twelve yuan. Later, it was settled for five yuan. We saw that things were not good. It wasn't just about paying money, but our belongings were slow to arrive. We were as anxious as ants in a hot pot. But since we were already at their mercy, we had no choice but to let them slaughter us. Later, a friend felt that this was outrageous. He secretly went out and called two patrol officers. The patrol officers asked about everything in detail and greatly reduced the price. When the inn saw the patrol officers, they panicked. The belongings were brought over, and the price they asked for was lower. However, they kept cursing under their breath. They almost became violent. In the end, we paid five yuan before we could escape from the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that anyone arriving in Shanghai by Yangtze River steamer should never open the door upon arrival. Once the door is opened, problems will arise. It's best to wait a while and let the crowd disperse before going out leisurely. Otherwise, you'll end up paying unfairly and being laughed at.</p>
<h3 id="e177">A Visit to the Spring Gathering of the Xiling Painting and Calligraphy Society <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Meiqu From Hangzhou</p>
<p>Painting and calligraphy are the quintessence of our country. Since the eastward spread of European styles, writing has imitated crab-walking, and painting has focused on watercolors and pencil oil painting. The old models of seal, clerical, running, and regular script, as well as realistic color painting, have almost disappeared. Hangzhou has an organization called the Xiling Painting and Calligraphy Society. My daughter, Yunhua, has recently been forced by circumstances to temporarily live with her mother. In her spare time from raising children, she was ordered by her mother to study painting and calligraphy with a teacher. In the past six months, her works in seal script, figure painting, flowers, etc., have been quite decent. She was admitted to the society as a member. February 16th was the date of the seventh spring gathering of the society. Two days earlier, I received an invitation from two elders of the society, Mr. Wang Qianlou and Mr. Lu Aitang, inviting my wife and me to visit. My wife was just recovering from an illness and could not be exposed to the wind. I went alone to visit and recorded what I saw below.</p>
<p>The Society's History and Address: The Society has been carefully organized by Hangzhou's elders and celebrities for seven years. The society's address is temporarily located at No. 19 Zhijian Road Lane. During the visit, Mr. Shen Shijia, a member of the society, told me that the society displays the works of its members once every spring. Fortunately, the number of members is increasing day by day. The leaders of the society are actively seeking to expand its development. Even the address of the society is being considered for relocation to a better place.</p>
<p>The Grand Occasion of the Gathering on That Day: The gathering opened at 9:00 AM and ended at 4:00 PM with a dinner and photo session. More than 140 male and female members of the society attended, with more than 60 people present. Because the society's exhibition space was a bit narrow, each member's calligraphy and paintings could not be hung up individually. However, those who collaborated on painting and calligraphy on the spot, such as Wang Qianlou, Lu Aitang, Shen Shijia, Zhu Jinglu, Hu Yaguang, Wu Jianhua, and female members He Huanwei, Fan Shichang, Fang Shuqing, Chuan Leiqing, and others, were proficient in the four styles of calligraphy and followed the former sages in painting. They were all modest at first when they waved their brushes to the guests. When they showed their skills, each was truly unwilling to yield. My daughter, Yunhua, also followed suit, bringing her standing scroll of seal script and meticulous painting of "Seven Sons." She was praised by the teachers and friends in the society. The visitors also had no derogatory words. She also completed the second half of the "Willow Shoots and Green Clouds" poem written by Shen Shijia in collaboration with Meixi Landscape under the teacher's order. All the ladies also had works that were worthy of being recited and read.</p>
<p>The Joyful Gathering at the Dinner: On this day, male and female members of the society and guests gathered in one hall. They were seated in the spacious house of a society member and toasted each other in separate seats. Male and female guests and members of the society were seated separately. The guests praised. Qianlou, Aitang, and Shijia all responded with humble words. Aitang once had a day of elegance, and he admired articles on political affairs. I revered Qianlou for the first time, and he abandoned his glory and indulged in painting and calligraphy, especially landscapes. Shijia is a young and promising talent who enters and exits between Mi Dian and Mo Jie. The calligraphy of Miss Chuan Leiqing and the Western paintings of Mr. Hu Yaguang are also not easy to come by. All members of the association are impeccable. My daughter is fortunate to follow the refined arts.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor: I recently read a news item in your publication about Hangzhou City, which stated that a large tiger in Huangjiahu Village, Thirteen Du, Xixiang, Zhuji, near Jiguan Mountain, was captured by villagers Huang Baiyou and others while hunting in the mountains and transported to Hangzhou for sale. It was then purchased by Hu Qingyutang in Dajing Lane for 1,300 yuan, etc. After checking, I found that the facts were different and not true. I have lived in Dingqing Village, Zhuji County, for generations and have always relied on hunting for a living. On the ninth day of the first month of this year, according to the old calendar, I discovered the footprints of a large tiger at the foot of Tiandong Mountain, a distance from my village. After studying them, the tiger's body was incomparably large and unusually ferocious. It seemed that a few people could not capture it. So I invited fifteen colleagues to track and hunt it separately. We started on the eleventh day at dawn and captured it at risk. Later, it was transported to Hangzhou and sold to Yezhongde Tang Pharmacy on Wangxianqiao Straight Street, receiving a real price of 350 yuan in silver. We returned to the village and divided the profits equally among ourselves. Unexpectedly, yesterday, due to your newspaper's misreporting of the tiger's sale price as 1,300 yuan, due to the long distance and brief words, it led to a misunderstanding. My fellow hunters were all suspicious and questioned me, believing that the seller had forgotten the meaning of shared hardship in the face of profit, embezzling the price to enrich himself. Although I explained it in every possible way, it was still difficult to obtain the understanding of the parties concerned. However, I have always admired your newspaper for its realistic reporting and emphasis on actual events. I am writing this special letter to explain the details, hoping that you will quickly correct the record to clarify the truth and avoid disputes. I am eternally grateful. With this letter, I salute you, Mr. Da Yi Bi. Your humble servants, Jiang Dingwen and Zhao Ating, together with Yin. February 21st.</p>

<p>— Guo Xin</p>
<p>Rome, Italy, February 21st (Special Telegram): The headquarters of the Italian Fascist Party has announced the style of women's clothing for the coming year in Italy. Long skirts, narrow collars, and long sleeves that reach the hands are very similar to the ancient clothing of the fourteenth century. The colors will exclude bright and beautiful colors and focus on green and gray. From now on, Italian women's clothing will be completely unaffected by the new fashions of other countries.</p>
<p>Translator's note: The Fascist Party is the political party formed by the great modern politician, Italian Prime Minister, and dictator Mussolini.</p>

<p>— Liu Henwo From Beiping</p>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, one of the changes in the Peking Opera circle in Pingzhong is the implementation of co-starring by men and women. The audience attendance is very good. Therefore, all the famous actors have invited female actors to cooperate. For example, Yang Xiaolou and Yan Jupeng are co-starring with Xin Qiuzhi at the Kaiming Theater. Hao Shuchen and Wu Tiean are co-starring with Zhang Guoyun at the Hualeyuan. Yu Sheng Sun, who has not dedicated himself to the red velvet for a long time, is also performing with He Shunqin at the Sanqingyuan. Ma Lianliang, who returned to Ping from Shanghai, also plans to invite Du Liyun. Shang Xiaoyun has also changed course and is looking for a female actor to perform.</p>
<p>Since the classes have set a precedent for co-starring by men and women, the Jixiangyuan in Dong'an Market in the city was the first to break the new record of separating men and women. According to the old customs in Pingzhong, men were on the left and women were on the right, and they were never mixed up. Now, it has been approved to have men and women sit together, which is very popular. Therefore, the Jixiangyuan is full day and night.</p>
<p>One evening after the lanterns were lit, Yang Xiaolou's "An Tian Hui" and Yan Jupeng's and Xin Yanqiu's "Visiting Mother and Returning Home" at the Kaiming Theater were extremely crowded. The theater was full at 8 o'clock. However, Xin Yanqiu forgot his command arrow when he was leading the order on stage. Then, he turned around and shouted for the inspector. He was severely heckled by the entire audience. It is said that Xin Yanqiu sobbed incessantly after leaving the stage. The critics in Pingzhong are often demanding. In fact, a small flaw is not a big deal. The critics are unaware, but the recipients are embarrassed. It is not easy to sell art on the singing stage.</p>
<p>Xue Yanqin is the most popular female actor among the kun actors. She often visits the boudoirs of noble families. She has been performing at Jixiang continuously for days. Female customers account for six out of ten of the audience. Yesterday, the seventh concubine of a certain director specially requested a performance of "Flower Field Wrong." She reserved more than a dozen boxes and invited all her sisters. Xue Yanqin's magic is not weak.</p>

<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>I have been involved in the spheres of national self-governance and social education for over a decade. This year, in August, I embarked on a journey. The purpose of this trip is solely to investigate the municipal administration and social education of major Japanese cities. However, as I am also one of the supervisors of the Jiangsu Provincial Newspaper Association and have been commissioned by Mr. Shi Liangcai, the manager of this newspaper, to serve as a special correspondent stationed in Japan, I will not only visit Japanese municipal administration and social education institutions but also report on newspapers, schools, historical scenic spots, and other places. For the sake of systematic and organized reporting, I will use my personal observations from visiting Nagasaki, Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe as the framework. This will include the municipal administration and social education institutions of these major cities. I will also cover newspapers, schools, historical scenic spots, and other places, recording them in chronological order of my visits. This will provide a clear and organized overview. I hope to use the experiences of others to provide insights for our country. I hope that the readers find it interesting.</p>
<p>(1) Retrospective before the journey</p>
<p>I have been involved in the spheres of national self-governance and social education for over a decade. In the autumn of the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], I was specially dispatched by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Shanxi to investigate self-governance administration. During my two-month stay in Shanxi, I traveled through three prefectures and eleven counties. Upon my return, I compiled my observations into "A True Record of Self-Governance Administration in Shanxi," which was published and circulated in multiple editions. I have never dared to be complacent. I had long planned to travel abroad to investigate municipal administration, hoping to gather diverse perspectives. Originally, I intended to travel to Europe and America. However, due to the high cost of traveling west, it was difficult to raise the funds in a short time. Later, I met Mr. Shi Liangcai, the manager of this newspaper, who suggested that our eastern neighbor, Japan, had been emulating Europe and America for many years. By striving continuously, they had achieved great things. Why not go there first to observe and learn? The journey would be shorter and less expensive, making it easier to realize. Therefore, I prepared everything and resolved to travel east. I was grateful to Zhao, the former minister of the Ministry of Interior, for providing a letter of introduction, and to Zhou, the director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for writing a letter to our ambassador to Japan, Wang Gunfu, to assist me in everything. In August, I took the Shanghai Maru eastward. Accompanying me were Ms. Du Huairong, a graduate of the former Shanghai Xinhua Art University, and Mr. Mao Qiubai, a Bachelor of Arts from the Imperial University of Japan. The Shanghai Maru was scheduled to set sail at 9:00 AM. I boarded at 7:00 AM. That day, I woke up at 5:00 AM and went to the wharf by car at 6:00 AM. There were very few visitors. With only a shoulder bag, I set off on a solitary journey. The sound of birds bid me farewell, and the color of the grass seemed to hold me back. As we set sail, a heavy rain suddenly came. The clouds and water were vast and misty. Fortunately, the small boat sailed without wind or waves. We arrived in Nagasaki at 12:00 PM the next morning. After anchoring, I learned that the ship would depart at 5:00 PM. The sea journey was tedious. With five hours to spare, time was precious. So, I accompanied Ms. Du to have lunch ashore and then visited Mr. Lin Zheqing, our consul in Nagasaki. He kindly asked Mr. Sun Lifu, the chief officer of the consulate, to accompany us to visit various municipal administration and social education institutions in Nagasaki. At 4:30 PM, I returned to the ship with Mr. Lin. Consul Lin came to the wharf to see us off. As we bid farewell, the ship's whistle sounded, and we set sail for Kobe.</p>
<p>(2) Investigation in Nagasaki</p>
<p>(A) Municipal Administration</p>
<p>Accompanied by Mr. Sun and Ms. Du from the Nagasaki consulate, I went to the Nagasaki City Hall (i.e., the Municipal Government). Mayor Tominaga was away on official business, so Deputy Mayor Tamaki Shogo received us. I learned that the mayors of Japanese cities are all elected by the people, and there is a city council to decide on matters within the city's scope. The councilors are also elected by the people. This is different from the current system in China's special and ordinary cities, where mayors are appointed administratively and there is no city council. However, under each city hall in Japan, there are also separate bureaus for education, civil engineering, social affairs, and finance, which are under the jurisdiction of the city and handle matters within their respective areas. This is generally the same as the bureaus under Chinese cities. Although the mayor is elected by the people, he is supervised by the prefectural governor in the prefecture and by the governor of the prefecture in the prefecture (Japan's administrative organization includes the two prefectures of Tokyo and Kyoto, and the forty-three prefectures of Nagasaki and Hyogo, etc. Each prefecture has a prefectural governor. Hokkaido and Karafuto each have a director. Taiwan, Korea, and Kwantung Leased Territory each have a governor-general. The South Pacific Islands are under the mandate of the League of Nations' Paris Peace Conference). This is different from the parallel relationship between cities and provinces or special cities and provinces in China. The city currently has 39,503 households and a population of 248,447. The annual income is 2,584,156 yen. The annual expenditure is 1,402,830 yen for regular expenses and 1,181,326 yen for temporary expenses, totaling the same amount as the annual income. The expenditure items include waterworks fees, harbor fees, housing fees, afforestation basic property, education funds, compatriot relief funds, town-owned funds, coal disaster compensation, city bond repayment accumulation funds, and public hall construction funds, totaling nine items. There are approximately 1,200 Chinese expatriates in the city, mostly engaged in commerce and industry, with a few monks. This place is close to China and is the first port of entry from China to Japan. It is also one of the country's strongholds. The city streets are clean, but there are few new buildings. Most of the houses are still old-fashioned Japanese low houses. Because Nagasaki is an ordinary city, it cannot be compared with the six major cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe.</p>

<p>[P Financial Market Remains Slightly Buoyant&gt;</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's trading of silver dollars was strong in the banks but scarce in the money shops. This is because the banks have a large number of securities to settle at the end of the month, and the daily transactions are also frequent, so the transactions are abundant. Although the money market is still loose and abundant on the surface, the content is slightly changing. Therefore, there was a margin lending rate yesterday.</p>
<p>Margin Rates: The early morning margin rate for "silver dollars" was 7 qian 2 fen 0.5 li, the same as the afternoon rate of the previous day. The afternoon rate rose by 0.25 hao to 7 qian 2 fen 0.75 hao. Silver margin rates in the early and afternoon markets were still considered borrowing. There was no problem with bank rates. The margin lending rate was 2 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Early morning price for Jiangnan small silver coins remained at 6 qian 1 fen. The afternoon price continued to decrease by 1.5 li to 6 qian 0.85 li. Trading volume was 4,000 jiao in the early morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. The early morning price for Guangdong small silver coins remained at 5 qian 9 fen 4.75 li, the same as the afternoon rate of the previous day. The afternoon price increased slightly by 0.5 li to 5 qian 9 fen 5.25 li. Trading volume was 125,000 jiao in the early morning and 95,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at the integer of 400,000 cash, with a trading volume of 34,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver" deposits at banks yesterday: Chinese merchants deposited over 1.6 million, foreign merchants deposited over 1.1 million, and remittance, customs duties and miscellaneous payments amounted to over 8 million. Deposits to warehouse were 800,000. Japanese banks deposited over 2.5 million in various payments and withdrew 400,000. Money shops and silver firms deposited over 24 million, overdraft deposits were over 2.7 million, and remittance deposits were over 800,000. Cash payments were tens of thousands. "Silver dollar" remittance and draft payments were 505,000 in the morning market and 580,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes only traded 5,000 in the afternoon market. Off-market trading was 72,000 in the morning and 44,000 in the afternoon. Interbank trading was 1.1 million in the morning and 750,000 in the afternoon. Foreign exchange transactions between banks amounted to over 1.1 million, and banknote inflows and outflows exceeded 1 million. Money shops and foreign exchange firms deposited over 3.5 million, and silver dollar overdraft deposits were over 1.22 million. Small money shops exchanged banknotes and sold remittances for over 660,000.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Gold Price Hits 500 Taels <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Soars: Yesterday's rise in the gold price was especially fierce, reaching a peak of 500 taels. The foreign exchange rate initially stabilized and then strengthened. All firms were settling sales. However, the market opened low in the morning due to a slight reduction in large bars, which dampened confidence. Later, buyers became active, and the exchange rate also tightened, rising by more than two taels. The forward East Asian exchange rate needed to be settled at 1.034375 taels. Buying and selling varied among firms. Wanxing, Shunli, and Shengda were all selling short positions. Taixing, Yuanxiang, Yuanmaoyong, and Zhifengyong were intermittently entering and exiting. Later, the market rose even higher. Because it was Wednesday, there was no foreign exchange market. However, hedging firms were all scrambling to buy. Shunli, Wanxing, and Taixing were still selling. However, market sentiment was strong, almost soaring a thousand feet, once breaking through the 500 tael mark, reaching a new high of 500 taels and 0.001 qian. The price eventually fell by 1 tael. Overall, there was a difference of five taels and several qian before and after. The market price still needs to fluctuate, but the high peak is not expected to be broken for the time being.</p>
<p>Initial Low Opening Gradually Peaks After Ten O'Clock: Yesterday, the London silver bar had shrunk by 1/16, the silver price had shrunk by 1/8, and the exchange rate had not changed. The opening price for the April gold contract was 494 taels and 5 qian, which had been reduced by 9 qian. The gross market fluctuated by more than 1 tael, falling from 95 taels and 56 qian to 4 taels and 45 qian. The exchange rate was still flat. Sanjing, etc., bought the April Japanese gold at 1.03375 taels. Mitsubishi bought the May US gold at 47.75 yuan. The spot British gold was bought by McCalle at 11 pence and 5 shillings. When the shilling was quoted, it was around 95 taels. The posted price did not move, and the internal rate was fixed. Dalian Bank mutually traded at 1.0325 taels. The forward Zhengjin absorbed over 1.031875 taels. Taiwan offered April at 1.03375 taels, and the gold price was outside of 95 taels. At 10:30, buyers were quite active, and the price gradually peaked, rising by 1 tael and 56 qian. Subsequently, the exchange rate rose even more. Sumitomo bought the spot Dalian gold at 1.035625 taels. Shanghai and Korea mutually traded May British gold with Tonghui and Sumitomo at 11.5 pence, so at 10:45, it was 96 taels and 89 qian. Afterwards, small investors sold, and McCalle and Industrial and Commercial Bank sold June British gold at 11.5625 pence, so it was reduced by slightly more than 1 tael, to 95.5 taels after 11:00. Afterwards, the buyers recovered and raised the price by 1 tael again. At noon, the closing price was 96 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<p>Hedgers Scramble to Buy, Closing Price Rises by 4.3 Taels: The post-market opened high, at 98 taels and 2 qian, because the goods had already opened at a high price. It then went to 8.5 taels. However, Taixing and Shengda sold, and it fell slightly to 7.5 taels. At 2:30, it gradually rose, and all firms were chasing the price, rising again to above 98 taels. At 3:30, it became even fiercer, with Dadecheng, Yuanxingyong, Yu Da, and hedgers scrambling to buy. For a time, the market was rising rapidly. Supply on the surface was scarce, and confidence was extremely strong. After 4:00, it reached 500 taels and 0.001 qian. Afterwards, small investors sold off because they could make a profit, so the price returned to within 500 taels, at 499 taels and 45 qian. Then, it fluctuated by several qian. At 4:30, the closing price was 499 taels and 7 qian, a decrease of 4.3 qian compared to the 25th. This has been repeated, totaling over 10 taels. Gold jewelry was limited to a rise of 70 yuan and 5 jiao. The maximum price during the day was 500 taels and 0.001 qian, and the minimum price was 494 taels and 4 qian, with a fluctuation of 5.7 qian. The quoted price was still 504 taels and 6 qian, a reduction of 8.9 taels. The book price was 97 taels to 96 taels, and the supplementary fee was 97 taels. The afternoon supplementary fee was changed to 500 taels, and the quoted price was only a small 5 taels. Gold jewelry in jewelry stores has increased by 0.5 yuan, totaling 70.5 yuan. The spot goods opened at 94 taels and 7 qian in the morning, closed at 6.6 qian at noon, 7.8 qian in the afternoon, and 8.8 qian at the close.</p>
<p>Dalian Bank Sells Over 3,000 Bars: Trading was quite active in various firms, but inflows and outflows varied. Yuanshengyong, Chengchang, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanmaoyong, and Juchang generally bought, while Dadecheng, Wanxing, Shunli, Shengda, and Fuchangyuan Yuyong all sold. Yongkang, Zhifengyong, Taixing, Yuantai, Yichang, and Yu Da bought after selling. The Dalian gang was still short, selling over 2,400 bars and buying 400-500 bars. The Guangdong gang only sold 400-500 bars. In the afternoon trading, Taixing, Shengda, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, and Yuantai all sold, while Yu Da, Yuanxingyong, Dadecheng, Yuansheng, and hedging firms all bought. Only general small investors (speculators) had varying inflows and outflows. The Dalian gang continued to sell 1,200-1,300 bars and bought only 100-200 bars. Hengxing of the Guangdong gang had a small number of inflows and outflows. Shengda sold about 700-800 bars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. Large bars of silver slightly contracted. The exchange rate did not change. However, the Indian exchange rate telegram decreased by 0.25 to 49 rupees and 25. The Yokohama and Kobe markets were still quiet and without change. As for the local foreign exchange market, the domestic market seemed weak in the early morning, but then tightened, due to the tendency for the gold price to rise from low. Because it was Wednesday afternoon, silver was usually closed, so there was no market situation. However, Chinese merchants bought and sold speculative tickets in small amounts. The Dalian and Guangdong gangs had some inflows and outflows, which were used to hedge gold prices. Shengda and others sold 30,000-40,000 pounds of British exchange. Banks like McCalle and Sanjing absorbed some. Various firms settled 40,000-50,000 pounds of McCalle exchange. Various banks mutually traded 60,000-70,000 pounds. Trading in US exchange was limited. A small number of Chinese merchants sold. 1 million yuan of Japanese exchange was also sold. The banks' appetite was not weak. Sumitomo, Sanjing, Mitsubishi, and Zhengjin all absorbed the May-June contracts. The settling volume was about 1 million yuan. Shanghai, Sanjing, and Sumitomo sold. However, people's confidence seemed hesitant, with no definite course of action.

<p>Yesterday, the public debt April futures market opened for trading. Debt prices suddenly rose again. Buying and selling became more active. The market sentiment was slightly revived. Various bonds were calm in the early morning due to the supply and demand. The price fluctuation was very slight. Although the secondary market was slightly firmer, the trend was still stable. The buying sentiment in the market suddenly turned active in the afternoon, and the demand surged. The price rose sharply. The Post-War Recovery continued to increase by more than 1 yuan for the March contract. Customs Duty Continued 25 also rose by about 1 yuan. Other bonds also uniformly firmed. Spot goods alone tended to be weak and sluggish. The total daily spot goods trading was only 11,000 yuan, while futures reached over 4.4 million.

<h3 id="e187">Glimmer of Hope in the Cotton Yarn and Cotton Market <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is slightly tight, but the trend is still flat. This is because the bottom goods are relatively thick, so most people are bearish, but a certain yarn factory's attitude is still calm and does not intend to loosen up. It independently absorbed the February goods, and most of the spot goods are now in its hands, tightly held and not sold. If actual sales can develop, there may be a period of rebound. The overseas cotton yarn market shows a slight turnaround, so some people took the opportunity to cover shorts, and the market rose by more than one or two points.</p>
<p>The human bid profited and covered shorts, rising by more than two points. After the market opened low for the futures cotton yarn, it triggered profitable short-covering, so the market turned upward. However, some small investors were still bearish. As a result, a large number of 51, 36, and 17 contracts were shorted, and the market was slightly firm. Each month rose by 9 qian to 1.1 qian. The human bid situation was still firm in the afternoon. The second and third rounds of rises were fierce. The closing saw 58 contracts sold. Some said that the situation was not good and would fall back by 3-4 qian. As a result, each month still rose by 1, 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total daily trading volume was 17,850 bales. The human bid closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>Spot Sales Still Good, Market Slightly Firm: Spot yarn was purchased by various gangs for 1,150 bales throughout the day. 1,700 bales were imported within the industry, and the market was slightly firm. Among the out-of-town gangs, the Qingdao gang had the strongest appetite, accounting for 520 bales. In addition, the Sichuan gang imported 250 bales, the mainland 50 bales, Jiangxi 80 bales, Guangdong 110 bales, Wuhu 35 bales, Anqing 40 bales, Niuzhuang 25 bales, Zhenjiang 30 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 60 bales.

<p>The cotton market turned upward. Because US cotton rebounded yesterday, the local confidence was slightly restored. The Hubei gang still bought, and the sentiment to go long was very strong. Moreover, the land prices in Hankou are still high, and there is an extreme lack of standard similar goods in the local area. Therefore, there is a squeeze on purchasing this month's contract. However, sellers sold in the distant months because the price of Indian cotton was low, and the market was relatively weak.</p>
<p>Retail Cotton Short-Covering Rebounded: The Human Bidding Market opened in the morning, with the rebound in foreign cotton, retailers short-covering, and the bag volume was very large. Each month rose by 2 qian to 2.5 qian. In the afternoon, 34 large amounts of short covering, totaling 6,400 piculs, each month rose by 1.5 points to 5 points. 38,700 piculs were traded throughout the day.

<p>American Cotton Rebounds, British and Indian Continue to Fall. Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to favorable news from Liverpool, then weakened due to profit-taking by bulls, and finally strengthened again due to short covering. Futures rose by 18 to 23 points, and spot prices rose by 20 points. British cotton futures fell by 1 to 3 points, and spot prices fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but later rebounded due to profit-taking by shorts. Ping-guo-er fell by 1 rupee, forward prices unchanged.

<h3 id="e190">Grain and River Rice Market Turns Stable <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday's arrivals tended to be scarce, sales remained sluggish. Northern japonica rice prices rose due to reports of high production costs in inland areas, and rumors of merchants from Changzhou and Wuxi actively buying, leading to upward pressure on market prices. However, this was inconsistent with Shanghai customs prices, and the Shanghai prices had been frequently lowered due to sluggish sales, resulting in reduced source supply. River-stored cargo merchants unanimously refrained from selling, so although central japonica rice prices were affected by sluggish sales, they were better than the previous day, with the downward trend largely stabilized. Transactions in thin-husked rice remained weak, and the market trended flat. There were a few customers inquiring about foreign indica rice, and the market was active, but prices did not fluctuate. Due to the low price of foreign rice, Du-bu indica rice showed no improvement in small-lot sales, and the overall market went from weak to stable. The various grades of "Lian Yin Yuan" rice saw gradually improving buying interest, and recent arrivals were not sufficient, leading to active liquidation at favorable prices. Overall, the volume of goods traded throughout the day remained low, with a total of less than 3,000 piculs.</p>
<p>South Shanghai River rice arrivals were being received, but street sales were not smooth. It was difficult to reduce prices for Changzhou and Northern japonica rice, and merchants in villages of Suzhou and Tongzhou also did not want to increase their holdings. Buyers wanted to reduce prices, resulting in a stalemate and sluggish transactions between both parties. The digestion of arrivals of thin-husked rice from the southern merchants continued sluggishly. Prices of better qualities remained stable, while those of lower qualities were still being evaluated. Demand for Yang-Du indica rice was dull, but because of the thinness of both stored and new rice, prices did not rise or fall. Both lower and better qualities of Bai-Yuan rice had some movement, and the situation had turned around, with the market trending tighter.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Foreign Rice Futures Improve by Three or Four Points <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was weak in the morning, with spot rice slightly declining by small fractions. In the afternoon, due to tightening futures prices, spot prices also strengthened. Foreign rice futures were supported by the belief among foreign firms that production costs were high, and they were reluctant to sell, with few recycled goods being offered. Near and far terms of Western rice improved by three or four points in small fractions, but trading volume was not high, with a total of only several thousand bags. Spot rice saw only small fractions, with 1,500 bags traded at prices ranging from 13.32 to 13.17 yuan. Other types were not actively traded. However, two ships carrying Saigon rice and other varieties are expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow, one of which is the "In-Ren-Maru," carrying over 20,000 bags, which has already arrived at the Songkou port.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Flour Market Plummets and Slightly Recovers <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month exhibited a pattern of sharp decline followed by a slight recovery. At the beginning of the month, because of the slight decline in the price of imported wheat, the lowest price reached 2 taels, 4 qian, and 8 and a half fen, down another small fen from the previous day. However, for March and later months, although the opening prices were also lower, speculators covering short positions and mainland merchants believed that the current market value had already fallen by 1 qian and 3 or 4 fen, or 1 qian and 6 or 7 fen, from the highest point. In terms of the extent of the decline, it was already considerable, and in terms of market value, it should be able to hold its ground. Therefore, buying interest revived, and the market stabilized. When the afternoon session opened, the prices for March through May were generally fluctuating, but the market sentiment had turned stable. For new flour for June and July, because manufacturers were not selling, the sentiment of outsiders was quite good, and the prices were particularly strong. If there are no special changes in imported wheat and the situation returns to peace, this kind of market value should not fall excessively. As a result, the price for the current month recovered by 2 li and a half from the previous day, March improved by 5 li, April by 7 li and a half, May by 1 fen and 7 li and a half, June by 1 fen and a half, and July by 1 fen and 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Wheat Futures Decline Slows Slightly <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, the price of imported wheat still declined slightly for each month, both in the morning and afternoon. However, after several days of large declines, market sentiment seemed to stabilize slightly, so although the market was still weak throughout the day, the decline was not very strong. However, according to industry insiders' speculation, because arrivals from the mainland were abundant and the combined price was only around 5 taels, if flour sales remain sluggish, it will be difficult for the wheat market to hold its ground. As a result, March arrivals entered the market at 5 taels, a small decrease of 2 fen from the previous day, April had no change, June decreased by a small fen, and July decreased by 2 fen. The spot market was extremely desolate, because manufacturers unanimously refused to purchase. Therefore, although over 1,300 bags were reluctantly offered yesterday, the offering price was incomparable to the prices of a few days ago. Only high-quality goods fell by a small 3 qian. Therefore, excessively high prices are likely to plummet. Speculators should pay attention. Haizhou wheat opened at 5 taels and 5 fen, and Nansu wheat opened at 5 taels and 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Piece Goods, Fine Cloth, and Fine Twill Fall Short of Demand <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The market is uniquely strong… while the rest are declining.</p>
<p>Yesterday, our factory's cotton cloth market saw a gradual decline in coarse cloth. 11-pound Three Rabbits and Three Deer had fallen to 4 taels and 6 qian and a half, 9-pound Cat Eagle to 4 taels and 1 qian and 7 and a half fen, and 13-pound Flying Bear and Four Peace Lotuses also plummeted by about 1 qian. This was because of stagnant sales to merchants, and manufacturers' inventories continued to accumulate, leading to a downward trend. However, fine cloth and fine twill are showing a flying and prosperous trend, and the factory's output cannot meet the demand. Yesterday, there were no spot goods for Colorful Ball and Trumpet Boy in fine cloth, and for Yang Crane in fine twill. Blue Chicken is also gradually becoming scarce due to the search and acquisition by Jiangxi and Ningbo merchants.</p>
<p>Although the exchange market for eastern and western piece goods tightened again yesterday, it was difficult to expect prices to improve. The reason was that most merchants stopped due to the instability of the situation, and the continuous decline made them more timid. Yesterday, fine Biji, printed cloth, satin, and other eastern goods continued to decline, with Yang Hongbiao down by a small 2 fen and a half, Guang Xie down by a small 5 fen, and Cute Beauty gray opening at 4 taels and 4 qian and 7 and a half fen, Yang Lan at 4 taels and 6 qian. Among the merchants, only the Yangtze merchant added goods, and the rest had no energy. The strips of silk from the Western goods were very active on the street yesterday, with over 50 pieces transacted. Taihe Fire Mountain was at 2 qian and 2 fen and a half, and Heji Peony Pavilion was at 2 qian and 4 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Hardware Borax Spot Goods Will Soon Be Exhausted <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Among the hardware, borax is an essential item for machinery manufacturers. Last year, because merchants were inactive, there were very few purchases, so imports are currently very scarce. Now, the business of the Geng Bing Arsenal, shipyards, and yarn factories has suddenly become prosperous, and merchants exporting to the Yangtze River area, Tianjin, Qingdao, and the three northeastern provinces all have a very strong appetite. As a result, the bottom goods have been bought, and it is almost exhausted. Affected by the environment, the market price is gradually rising. Currently, white goods are opening at 15 taels per dan, an increase of about 2 taels compared to the red plate, and yellow goods are at 19 taels, an increase of 5 qian from the previous offer.</p>

<p>Recently, peach meat prices in Hancheng have repeatedly fallen back, and the trend is very weak. Yesterday's telegram said that it had reached 18 taels, a decrease of about 3 taels compared to the previous market. Although the inventory in the local market is not thick, the market is not good, and the selling price has also dropped from 24 taels to 21 or 22 taels. Currently, only the mainland local street has some transactions, and it will not be easy to turn around for a while.</p>

<p>The inventory of building ice is getting thinner as it is sold, and the market price is tightening. Yesterday, I heard that Da Lai Hao arrived at more than one hundred boxes of tongshou ice. The various lines heard the news, and scrambled for it immediately, and the price was 6 taels 3 qian, which was 1 qian higher than before. According to the news, Wufu's ice has also been loaded and will arrive today. The market looks tighter again.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Recent Dutch Literary Scene: New Works by Dutch Female Novelists <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>--Manru</p>
<p>Since ancient times, literature has been the mirror of life. This is universally acknowledged. However, literature not only reflects life, but also has some influence on it. Therefore, we can add that life influences literature, and literature also influences life. This is especially true in modern times. If we want to know the living conditions and national psychology of a certain country, the best way is to look at the artistic works of that country. The understanding we gain from such works is often more accurate and concise than the impressions we get from traveling there.</p>
<p>Because most of the books published in the Netherlands recently deal with issues of sexuality, failed marriages, divorce, and free love experiments, we can conclude that the question of whether the existing marriage laws are appropriate and whether men and women are truly monogamous beings has arisen in the Netherlands. Such questions are common in recent Dutch novels, and some even offer answers. This shows that sex, love, and marriage are currently the most important issues for the Dutch.</p>
<p>Although the Netherlands is not a large country and does not have many writers, it has quite a few female writers, especially in the field of novels. The achievements of female writers are excellent. Recently, four female writers published four full-length novels, which is a noteworthy event in the recent Dutch literary scene. Three of them focus on love, marriage, and family issues. From these three, we can see the attitudes, opinions, and solutions of Dutch women towards these issues. Now, let's talk about the content of these four novels.</p>
<p>The first female novelist is Mrs. Van Ammers Kuller. In her latest work, "Tantalus," she tells the story of a couple with three children who seem to be happy. The novel is titled "Tantalus" because the husband is like Tantalus in Greek mythology. Tantalus was the son of Zeus and lived in the heavenly palace. Later, because he was too arrogant, he angered the gods and was thrown into hell, immersed in a lake. When he was thirsty and wanted to drink, the water suddenly became shallow. When he was hungry and wanted to pick the fruit above his head, the fruit suddenly rose. Therefore, he was always looking at things that were desirable but unattainable, and was always hungry and thirsty. Our male protagonist is also such a character. Although his wife is beautiful, gentle, and loyal, he always feels unsatisfied and hungry. Unfortunately, he is like that unlucky Tantalus. When he sees water and wants to drink it, the water recedes. When he sees fruit and wants to eat it, the fruit moves away. He endured such pain for a long time, but never gave up. Therefore, when he later encountered delicious fruit, and the fruit was stuffed into his mouth by someone who wanted him to eat it, he quickly swallowed it. But he didn't expect to eat rotten fruit. The young woman didn't have good intentions in seducing him. Thus, this man, who was already forty and whose hair was a bit gray, made himself a laughing stock, and besides physical satisfaction, he felt deeply disappointed.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful novel, especially because it depicts the wife's sorrow and despair very well, without being excessive or insufficient. Although this novel is not as good as her masterpiece "The Rebel Generation," it can still calmly and objectively depict the mentality, life, and misfortunes caused by desires of modern people, without suggesting remedies or solutions.</p>
<p>The story of "Tantalus" only raises a question: if a husband does something wrong to his wife, should they divorce or continue to live together? The author does not give us an answer, but "Daughters" is different. It not only writes about divorce, but also provides a solution. "Daughters" is written by Carl Van Lidth Jeude. What she focuses on is not the issue of divorce, but the tragic consequences of divorce for children. When parents act selfishly and divorce at will, the happiness of their children is destroyed, and they do not consider the misfortunes that their children will suffer in the future. In the author's opinion, this is a very painful thing. Therefore, she uses this situation as the center and writes a serious and realistic novel. Moreover, in the novel, she gives a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>The story involves a divorced couple, and their daughters live separately. One follows her father and enjoys absolute freedom to continue her studies. The other follows her mother and grandmother and lives a domestic life. However, her mother is devoted to charity and social work, so she does not discipline her much. Therefore, she lives a free life. Like those divorced women, everyone is free and financially independent, but everyone cannot find happiness. The grandmother watches coldly and observes this group of new women and their new personalities. She feels that the pace of life of this younger generation is faster, their actions are freer, and their ideas are more progressive. However... she feels that everything is still the same in essence, with no change.</p>
<p>One daughter gets married and has children, but suddenly discovers that her husband is flirting with a young girl. She feels that this is intolerable and decides to separate from him. Another daughter, however, falls in love with a married man who is twenty years older than her and already has children. However, he is willing to divorce his wife to marry her. At this point, the plot of the story becomes complicated. At this time, there are two more groups of children who are about to be driven out of the family. But suddenly there is a big turning point. One of the two daughters suddenly understands what is about to happen. So the two sisters go abroad together, and in the fresh mountain air, they thoroughly discuss this issue. Their conclusion is that parents cannot be too selfish and should think about their children. Therefore, sacrificing for the sake of children is something they should do. After they come up with a solution, they return. One still goes back to reconcile with her husband, trying to forgive him and win back his love. The other rejects her lover.</p>
<p>This solution is of course the answer that the author gives us, but it is difficult to say whether this answer is correct. However, the situations in different countries are different, the situations in different eras are different, and the situations of different people are different. What is suitable for one is often not suitable for another. If you encounter this kind of problem, the best way is to create your own answer. What the author says is just the author's answer.</p>
<p>Calry Van Bruggen, in "Eve," tells the story of a woman named Eve. Eve has experienced everything that can happen in life, but she still finds life mysterious. She never understands life. As a young girl, she feels different from other girls, but she does not dare to be different. She loves beauty, loves family, especially her twin brother. But she often lives in her own fantasy world, afraid to touch the secrets of adults. When she reaches the period of flirting and sexual awakening, she is even more confused. When a young man whistles to her at night to ask her to go out, she is unwilling to listen, but she goes out to meet him. When he kisses her in a dark garden, she is suddenly filled with ecstasy, but when he roughly touches her, she runs away. However, she now understands why girls all love to go to dark gardens. Is this kind of thing right or wrong? She frantically and hastily reads a lot of books, wanting to discover from the books what the other side of love is. Then she finds the answer from Frederik Van Eeden (one of the greatest Dutch poets and prose writers). Van Eeden says,</p>
<p>Only that love which, in the highest joy, is stronger than all the ideals of the soul, can make carnal desire beautiful. Without that highest joy, all physical desires are merely filthy, despicable, immoral licentiousness. She regards this sentence as the golden rule, and she never forgets this sentence in her life. She gets married, has children, and feels that she is a mother, not a wife. So when her husband tells her that he loves another woman, they separate like friends. She is very satisfied to have children. But she becomes mysterious again. She does not know what place she occupies in life. She is ranked among the "noble middle-aged ladies", but she feels that she is neither noble, nor middle-aged, nor a lady. So, just when she believes that she has ended all absurd things after having two grown children, she suddenly discovers that she has truly fallen in love with a man for the first time in her life, and only this time. Until now, she realizes that there is no room for fear and shame in love. In love, there is only passion and courage. Until now, she realizes that Van Eeden's theory is a fallacious theory.</p>
<p>This is indeed a very unusual work, and it is different from the author's previous works. The author's previous works were often delicate and philosophical, but "Eve" was written in a moment of inspiration, with unpretentious prose. However, even so, this novel is very active and fluent, and it analyzes a woman's psychology very exquisitely and sincerely. Furthermore, this novel can also be said to be the autobiography of this female novelist. She was the pioneer of the Dutch "modern girl", cutting her hair short and walking on the street without a hat. She was the first one. Those who know her past life can easily find traces of her in this novel.</p>
<p>The above three are centered on marriage and love, but Mathile A Van BJLaen's "Island of Forgetfulness" is completely different from these three. This is the winning novel in the previous Dutch prize-winning competition. Among the two hundred or so anonymous entries, this novel won first place. However, unfortunately, its author passed away before the prize was announced. She was still a young female writer.</p>
<p>This is a novel about post-war life, obviously written because the author witnessed many post-war tragedies. The book roughly says that a doctor in British India obtains a secret medicine, taking it causes people to lose their memory. Because many people cannot forget the tragedies of the past and suffer pain in their hearts, this kind doctor wants to use this medicine to make them forget everything. He later actually finds some of these poor people (the book tells their individual stories), and takes them to a desert island. Everyone drinks this medicine juice at the same time, and the medicine is indeed effective. They forget all their past and no longer remember their sorrows. Then, their life should be happy and happy, but it is not. Their thinking power still exists. They gradually become surprised and eager to understand where they came from. Later, they learn that they have taken a kind of medicine. So everyone feels that the truth, even if it is terrible, is always better than groping in the dark without knowing anything. So they force the doctor to give them some antidote to restore them to their original state. The doctor cannot deal with them, but luckily he has an antidote, so he gives them the antidote. These people have since fallen into the sea of sorrow again.</p>
<p>The idea of this novel is very novel, but unfortunately the technique is worse, the style is also dry and clumsy, and the ability of this medicine shows flaws, which is not easy to cause the reader to believe. This is the author's lack of talent. Although the whole book is quite era-specific,</p>

<p>Central to Screen Famous German Film</p>
<p>The Central Company declares that German films tend to emphasize ideals, especially the pursuit of material civilization in the future, unlike American films, which focus solely on love without any basis, and intentionally attack the weaknesses of foreign countries. The Central Company has not seen this in German films. For example, German film works during the European War had no political odor. Most works adopted the essence of mythology and art. Therefore, knowledgeable people in various countries also praised the German film industry for its contribution to improving humanity through art. Recently, the most valuable films screened in Shanghai are "Scientific World" and "Absurd Love". The former has a religious background, and the latter has an ethical background, and the key is the mystery of artificial humans, and the creator temporarily loses his ambition and wants to deceive the created person. Eventually, he is harmed by the created person. Its punishment of evil and warning to the world are one and the same. The grandeur of the background in the film and the exquisite coloring and engraving are especially praised by the art world. It is said that this film will be continuously screened at the Central Grand Theater for three days starting from March 1.</p>
<p>Paris Premiere of "Iron Heel Red Dance" a Sensation</p>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater declares that yesterday, the first day of the world-shaking Russian Revolution love epic "Iron Heel Red Dance" premiered at this theater. All three shows, day and night, were sold out upstairs and downstairs. Many people were turned away due to late arrival. The plot and scenery of the drama can be called unparalleled, and the American socialite's stage performance of "Red Dance" is very sensual, and the audience is very satisfied.</p>

<p>— Sunflower</p>
<p>Speaking out for Young Men and Women</p>
<p>I have lived past sixteen years old, I am getting old. I have lived through the two most beautiful ages. In anyone's life history, the so-called wonderful age of youth is only the two ages of fifteen and sixteen.</p>
<p>Ah, why do parents, teachers, and elders in society generally lock up young men and women who are at the age of wonderfulness, and confine them in a box-like world? Why force them to stay away from nature, away from the forest, away from happiness? Why strictly forbid them from interacting with young people of the opposite sex?</p>
<p>Why only teach them boring and useless courses, but not enlighten ordinary young men and women with interesting and beneficial literature and art, or common sense about physiological health?</p>
<p>Why only tirelessly explain the methods of mathematics and the principles of philosophy, but not mention a word about the methods of love and the principles of marriage that are closely related to the youth that will never return?</p>
<p>Do you think that the age of youth is not worth cherishing, that youth will come back after it is gone, that human beings can have two sixteen-year-olds? Please read the following two sentences:</p>
<p>Fifteen years old is the age when a woman leaves her childhood, leaves the hands of the creator, how innocent and pure.</p>
<p>What do you think after reading this? Aren't you going to examine your conscience? Ah, your wonderful age has been ravaged by your enforcers. Although you now deeply regret it, or resent it, time will never return, and it is too late.</p>
<p>Why use gender to separate young people? Why forbid them from socializing? Finally, I want to ask you, why must you first make them marry before you are willing to let young men associate with young women, or let young women associate with young men?</p>
<p>Ah, the world is so beautiful, and human beings are so intelligent. The creator puts young men and women together, calling them to love and rejoice with each other from morning to night, from night to morning. One look from one of them can make the other happy. Just a lock of hair can be preserved for ten years. Just one kiss contributes the entire life. This is truly a wonderful, beautiful, and fragrant sweet dream. This seems to be a special right that can be enjoyed in youth.</p>
<p>However, social figures insist on destroying it, saying something like "These children's love cannot last long, and they should be corrected, and they must not be allowed to indulge in love." So people isolate them, closing him or her alone in a desolate bedroom or study, using all means to destroy their youth. The man is told to study, and the woman is told to sew. The books that people give to young women to read are all unimportant moral cultivation textbooks, until she marries a husband, then they say to her, "From now on, you can read whatever you want." Then she naturally chooses to read novels. Her favorite things to read are the works of Zola and Maupassant.</p>
<p>God, if I could live with a girl of my age, have a girl to worship, a lover, how happy I would be. I would willingly hold her neck for the rest of my life, my head resting on her chest, my lips touching her cheeks, her hair covering my eyes...</p>
<p>Ah, woman, woman, I am already seventeen years old, I have never tasted a kiss of love, never heard a word of love, never seen a smile. Ah, I am going to burn, I am going to burn!</p>
<p>Ah, every dusk, I sleep alone in bed, tossing and turning unable to sleep. Every time I imagine that my dream lover is sleeping next to me, everyone cuddling together, I caress her, she comforts me, without any evil thoughts. Ah, I only see her face, her hair, her head, the rest is just a blurry shadow. We talk lovingly, and the scent of love emanates from her body. I am drunk... My bed becomes the Garden of Eden. But when I wake up the next morning, I am just one person, feeling more lonely than before, my heart is tight, my tongue is dry, and my spirit is sad. Ah, please don't laugh at me, some of you must have the same illness as me. Ah, when I am now writing these lines, my mind is still uneasy. Perhaps there is a lovely sixteen-year-old girl who is also writing the same boredom and loneliness as me in her diary. She is thirsting to find a young man like me.</p>
<p>It is also unknowable...</p>
<p>Ahem, ahem, I can't write anymore, I'm going to cry.</p>
<p>Excerpted and translated from "Secret Diary" by Pierre Louÿs (Diary of October 10, 1887)</p>

<p>(3) Going to the Vegetable Market</p>
<p>Everyone, directly or indirectly, has some relationship with the vegetable market, from simple meals of rice and greens to elaborate banquets with delicacies. From entering the throat to the stomach, and then from the stomach to fertilizer, in this great cycle, you can't escape the process of the vegetable market. In the vegetable market, we can see all kinds of flora and fauna, such as vegetables, fish, meat, shrimp, crabs, shellfish, etc. Different things have different colors and inconsistent smells. Green, yellow, red, white, black, sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty, everything is available, all-encompassing. The vegetable market is like a miniature society, intricate and complex, with the most members, and different in price and distinct in class. Those who study social science must have a deep understanding of the economic organization and material distribution in society in order to understand the origin of various realities in society. We go to the vegetable market, and we want to study the philosophy in the vegetable market.</p>
<p>For women, going to the vegetable market is like going to the battlefield. The vegetable vendors in the vegetable market are naturally "waiting in battle." It is not surprising to argue over a few copper coins or a few vegetables. They are meticulous and not afraid of trouble in choosing vegetables and picking fish and meat. Eyes, nose, and fingers are used together to make a final decision. As for the price, it is more important than the material. Customers ask each other about prices, just like inquiring about military intelligence. The vegetable vendors bargaining with customers is like issuing a challenge, with verbal battles and endless noise. By the time things are bought, the spirit is almost gone. That's probably why there is such a loud noise in every vegetable market when it opens.</p>
<p>When you walk through the vegetable market, you may as well slow down and observe for five minutes. The vegetable vendors stand behind their stalls, their eyes looking either into the customers' baskets or into their own baskets, their mouths shouting, and their hands moving continuously. This is nothing more than the meaning of promotion and attracting customers. For example, the vegetable vendor selling radishes often turns the vegetable basket, picks the largest and fattest radishes, and throws them in his palm. Most of the fish on the fish stall are out of breath. The fish vendors also roll up their sleeves and reach into the water to fish. In fact, reaching into the water can at least get two or three fish. However, he circled several times in the water bucket, and then tightly grasped a fish, as if the fish was about to jump away. When it came out of the water, it was still splashing around. This is nothing more than indicating to customers that the fish is "alive." In fact, the meaning of "lively" in the fish vendor's mouth is "no action, no jump."</p>
<p>As for the customers who buy vegetables, the expressions on their faces have various changes. For example, a woman wants to buy bamboo shoots. When she passes the bamboo shoot stall, she slows down, looks into the bamboo shoot basket, and asks the price after a while. At this time, her expression at least contains a sign of hope. If the price asked by the bamboo shoot vendor is too high or surprisingly cheap, the expression on her face will change again. Once the price is agreed upon, she will start to pick and choose. If the head of a bamboo shoot is too long and too old, she will usually ask the bamboo shoot vendor to cut it off. Since the bamboo shoot vendor cuts off too much, the weight will be reduced, and he cannot buy more money. So he cuts off a corner thinly. The woman disagrees and must ask him to cut off more. At this time, there is a major change on her face, because the principle of economics is the simplest, and other people's cheapness is her own loss, so she must be cautious. The last step is to pay. Copper coins are like bullets, and there is no reason to misfire one.</p>
<p>From six or seven o'clock in the morning until nine or ten o'clock in the morning, people in the vegetable market are busy coming in and out. Bright colors and fishy smells are sent to people at the same time. There are pleasing green and red colors, natural earthy smells, terrible flesh and blood, and discordant fishy smells. The ground in the vegetable market is always wet for ten out of ten days. The air inside is more turbid than clean. The wooden shelves for displaying vegetables and the bamboo baskets for storing vegetables are the only utensils in the vegetable market. When it is not yet dawn, under the deep yellow light, many vegetable vendors carry their goods and rush to the vegetable market. Not much</p>
<p>In a moment, the thin and bony shelves will be piled</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Quite a lot of meat and fish. Later, more and more people gathered, and the wooden shelves were gradually hidden. After lunch, those pairs of shelves still exposed their bones to people.</p>
<p>Except when there is a vegetable market, there is no fun in the vegetable market. The cold cement floor is wet in one place and dry in another. There is no decoration around except for the pillars. However, it is very different in the morning. Different things are displayed, placed horizontally, placed vertically, piled up, and laid flat, each different. Some people manage seven or eight baskets, and some have other things besides a pile of shallots and ginger. As for the hawkers selling household goods, they also borrow the vegetable market as their base camp. In addition, there are many pawn shops, southern goods stores, and ham stores opened near the vegetable market. There are so many shops that are incidentally produced by the vegetable market that it is impossible to say them all at once. However, the opening of matchmaker shops near the vegetable market indirectly contains a direct meaning, which is definitely not accidental.</p>
<p>There are no less than thirty or forty vegetable markets in the whole city of Shanghai. Taking the public concession alone, there are thirteen or fourteen places such as Hongkou, Xinzha, Avenue Edward VII, Huishan, East Hongkou, Rue Marco Polo, Boone Road, North Fujian Road, Wuzhou Road, Songpan Road, and Yangshupu. The number of vegetable stalls totals about four or five thousand. The stall donations collected by the Municipal Council in various vegetable markets every year are nearly 200,000 yuan, which is quite considerable. Ordinary vegetable markets are only on flat ground, and larger ones have one or two floors, mostly cement buildings. The iron house vegetable market on Nanjing Road sells some "raw Western vegetables". The Hongkou vegetable market has the most variety, telling us that there are many places with international flavors.</p>
<p>The situation in the vegetable market varies in four seasons. There is also a seasonal relationship between vegetables, fish, and meat. The vegetable market tells us about the change of climate, and also tells us about the social situation. As for the merits of the municipal administration and the habits of the residents, the vegetable market is an excellent "information center".</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, as of the end of June last year, the number of chicken farmers in Japan was 3,438,622, a decrease of 31,178 households from the previous year. There were a total of 48,257,620 chickens, worth 44,316,358 yuan. The total output in the year before the end of June last year was 253,172,9569 eggs, worth 88,904,450 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Fastest Flying Insect <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Liang Xiongwan</p>
<p>In the world, if there really is an insect that can fly 850 miles per hour, it must be able to make long-distance flights without having to stop midway. At four o'clock in the morning, it can leave New York, fly around the earth in a week, and still be able to fly back to New York at nine o'clock that night. Is there really such a capable insect with such rapid flight in the world? Yes, there really is. Dr. Charles Townson recently discovered this insect, called Cehonomyia. There are very few of this kind of insects in the world, because of its rapid flight, it is indeed a difficult task to collect this kind of insect, and the number of Cehonomyia that have been collected is only a few. Multiple trials have confirmed that its rapid flight is indeed as described above. If such a rate can be obtained from artificial machinery, the speed of transportation will have an astonishing improvement. For example, if an airplane can fly 850 miles per hour, we can leave New York at four o'clock in the morning, have breakfast in Reno, have lunch in Beijing, have a snack in Constantinople, have dinner in Madrid, and may be able to fly back to New York at nine o'clock in the same afternoon.</p>
<p>This Cehonomyia insect can fly around the earth in a week in seventeen hours. Its body is as big as a large bee, and its speed per hour is three times the speed of an ordinary airplane.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Germany's Passion Play <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Bi Tian</p>
<p>Speaking of the Oberammergau Passion Play in Bavaria, Germany, it is extremely famous in Europe. This kind of Passion Play has been staged for 300 years, but it is not staged every year. The custom is to perform it once every ten years, and there is only a preview in ordinary years. This year happens to be the year of performance. In Europe, such news must have been very noisy.</p>
<p>This Passion Play is entirely performed by ordinary people - merchants, farmers, workers and people of all classes. However, because there is a preview once a year, the skills of the actors have also been tempered to a considerable extent, but it is naturally different from professional actors. The performance is full of plainness, purity, and piety, and can hold the audience's hearts. The roles of Jesus and the Virgin Mary are determined by the general villagers' vote. The time is from May to August, twice a week, and there are a total of thirty-two performances. The theater is an extension of the original theater, with about 5,200 seats. Seat reservations have probably been booked, and about 80% of the total number is occupied by Americans.</p>
