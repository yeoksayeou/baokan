<p>說明風潮眞相校長人選標準「擾亂情形」</p>
<p>中大全體學生會與中大學生會之暗潮前日中大全體學生開會對於校長問題有所建議同</p>
<p>時並制止現在中大學生會之一切活動另組特别委員會辦理大會一切决議本甚合法惟中大學生會認爲全體大會决議第四案以下會場人數不足决議爲非法引起雙方之爭論即對外宣言亦各别中大學生會昨日（七日）並推代表呈請市黨部制止中大學生會體大會主席團劉世超唐自泉涂鉅堯之活動茲將雙方宣言記述如下</p>
<p>第一次學生全體大會宣言</p>
<h3 id="c95">（一）此次風潮發生之經過 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>自國民政府奠都南京本校改組以來於今三年此三年之中本校校名曾幾度改變本校經費會幾次動搖本校行政系統亦曾因大學組織法之修改而有數次之改組時至今日始終未離草創時期在此時期一切行政未入軌道所獲成績實與預期相去頗遠本校同學固深知理想大學决非二三年内所能成就此種現象實爲國内一般大學草創時代所不能然感於社會期望之殷切怵於自身使命之重大無時不深自警惕三年以來本校同學對外無日不謀本校根基之穩固對内更無日不備校務之進展此次改進校務運動之始意也</p>
<p>數星期前同學涂鉅堯等六百餘人發起校務改進運動所涉問題雖甚繁多對於一二　職職員雖有指摘要無非激於愛校之𤍠忱實能代表全體同學努力進取之心理即其所取手段亦毫未越出範圍本校同學以爲此種正當之要求必能蒙學校之接受故提出要求後即靜待學校答覆絶不　風潮至於擴大乃忽有許自誠等以　應涂等之建議書徴求同學簽名而翌日許等於呈送校長建議書中則别增條欵且事有涉及個人者於是已簽名於許等建議書諸同學以其與簽名原意不合紛紛聲明否認於是同學間整個一致之意見忽呈歧異現象翌日張校長即因是辭職赴滬一面裁併原有敎務　書三處合爲總務處以黃曝　氏任總務長本校全體同學及敎授咸以爲未經敎務會議正式通過遽行變更學校行政組織已多未妥且此不倫不類之總務處更與大學組織法根本衝突遂堅持反對而黃氏復不顧　情貿然就職於十月二十七日紀念週禮畢黃氏報告時同學紛起質問黃氏不能答覆遂宣布以後對於中央大學不再負責此次風潮經過之大概也</p>
<h3 id="c96">（二）我們現在的熊度 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>本校在此風雨飄搖之中雖幸免於渙散但政府旣一時無解决辦法野心者復欲乘機利用於是假借名義之傳單常發現於校内别具心腸之攻訐更紛起於校外淆亂是非莫此爲甚本校全體同學鑒於時機之危迫不可不予以明白正確之糾正爰於十一月五日舉行全體大會一致議决下列諸點作鄭重之表示（一）在校長問題未解决</p>
<p>前本校務雖有院長合議暫時維持學生方面亦應組織特别委員會負責處理大會一切决議凡遇去及今後未經大會正式承認之團體如前次之護校運動委員會救校鋤奸委員會等對外發</p>
<p>表之意見吾人爲保持學府尊嚴計爲防免奸人利用計一概予以否認（二）我全體同學深悉自身所負之使命現正安心上課校長問題惟有靜待我政府之會理的解决對於繼任校長人選亦幾經討論深覺有提出下列標準之必要一學問道德素孚衆望而無官僚習氣者二能專心任事而有發展中大之决心及能力者（三）辦理高等敎育有成效者（四）在黨國有相當歷史者吾校全體同學認定上述各條實爲大學校長應備之最低標</p>
<p>準吾人當以十分决心促其實現凡合於此項標準之繼任校長吾人誓竭前力擁護之凡不合此</p>
<p>等標準之校長吾人誓竭全力反對之吾全校同學對於私人無所愛惡惟對於學校前途之發展則抱有最大之决心</p>
<h3 id="c97">（三）對於社會人士及政府之希望 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>本校現已人於千鈞一髮之際全體同學深知社會人士政府當局因對本校期望過殷責備彌切流言人耳或以爲本校校風腐敗思想龐雜甚或以爲國家主義派與共產黨之角力場我全體</p>
<p>同學今欲宣告於社會者即本校年來施行三民主義敎育未敢後人全校同學任重道遠頗知自勵自本校風潮發生一月以來我全體同學及敎授皆照常安心上課期往政府合法解决絶無如外界所謠傳之事實吾人深信政府當局若</p>
<p>具遠大之眼光必能本提倡學術之意充分採納吾人所提出之校長人選標準爲迅速而賢明之處置我中央大學位置首都觀　中外我全體同學誓以十二分之决心和毅力努力其前途之發展更希望社會人士政府當局與此决心毅力以深切之扶持謹此宣言</p>

<p>日郵社之歐洲班輪白山丸係該社之甲級郵船凈載理一萬三百五十噸今次由歐返日經過上海詎自滬赴東洋在神户發生撞毁情事旅客亦死亡一名茲將該社昨得消息分誌如下</p>
<p>撞碰情形查白山丸自四號離滬至六日下午三時三十五分行至神户之和多岬第三突堤之際適有腦威貨輪丹麥號（凈載量五千五百噸）從神户開出兩船行近大致水激風大不及互讓致丹麥號輪之船頭猛向白山丸擱腰撞擊幸白山丸船主加籐美知急打倒車退讓未被截成兩段但在煤艙外舷已撞一大洞海水冲浸艙内白山丸船身即向海傾斜幾致翻沉經船主急令駛擱淺灘保持船體</p>
<p>旅客救出在撞碰之時震力極大船内旅客由歐赴日者頗多由上海下船到日本者計有陳正業·吴連山·方國運·葉萬興·及日人通口伊籐·齊籐·茂勇·等十名竸奔艙面圖逃生命有一六十八歲之英籍神父在船跌斃船主念命水手先放小划將船内大小旅客一律載送上岸其時船已半傾海面人不能立昨午本埠接到來電謂在船乘客均皆救出安全無不云</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>三十以下的男子常會費去了寳貴的光陰去幹一種鹵莽而又愚蠢的事三十以上五十以下他們就設法悔懺五十以後則反以靑年時所幹的事爲可慶而不絶地自加誇奬</p>
<p>假使男子們對於女人能明瞭地表示了一種準確不易的標準後人類原生活一定可以比較的簡單比較的甜蜜比較的和平</p>
<p>女人是一種掘根到底善於設問的動物伊對一個男友要間他是否愛伊得着了「是」的回答後伊又要問他爲什麽道理愛伊男子們就在這地方得到了勝利或是失敗</p>
<p>女人之對於男人常喜歡發問而盤問着理由可是男子們却最怕人發問而其行爲却多無理由可說兩者之間似乎天生的有點矛盾然而男女相戀决不因此而稍衰這其中自有不可思議的魔力在</p>
<p>當一個小孩子在以泥石搭墻的時候他不希望别人來帮他的忙否則就會失去了樂趣同樣的當一個男子愛上一個女子的時候也不要任何人來助以一臂之力</p>
<p>男子們像一隻貓只要讓他自由自在他有時也會很忠心地服從着你女子們像一隻狗只要你不絶地同伊玩給東西伊吃伊就會很馴服地聽你的話了</p>
<p>一個男子可以失去他电後的一根頭髮最後的一個朋友和最後的一塊洋錢然而設非最後的熱忱失去了以後他心上的熱火决不會消滅</p>
<p>「你爲什麽結了婚」這名簡單的問句十個男子中有九個不能加以回答而十個女子中有九個不肯加以回答</p>

<p>皓首之評判員　先期該會請有評判員數位皆邑中名人競賽日評判員又公推鳴鶴塲翁瑞慶君爲評主席翁年已古稀鬚眉皓然白髮漸秃矣然猶振作精神秉公評判可見其對於運動豪興不减靑年</p>
<p>山路峙嶇難行　各選手平日練習均在操塲平坦廣袤自易騎行不料競賽地點規定爲崎嶇難行之伏龍山荆棘當道碎石阻礙車輪所越奔騰竄躍非唯臀部發生疼痛甚且傾跌流血焉</p>
<p>小學生獲錦標　錦堂校初級四年生邵某年纔十四向住伏龍山麓此次亦參全隊三十人能及半山已不多得獨邵</p>
<p>此山駕輕就熟其獲錦標也宜矣</p>
<p>女敎員畏難　是日本有二三女敎員亦擬大獻好身手詎一見路徑頓畏困難遂臨時取消與賽敗興而返</p>

<p>歐游通訊（八十四）</p>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡游意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（四）</p>
<p>第二日鬥獸塲君士坦丁帝凱旋門加拉加拉共同浴塲地下敎堂第二天我們在悠久的躊躇以後就去訪問羅馬諦鐸Rius大帝時代的遺物世界現存最大的建築物的鬥獸塲了</p>
<p>在烈日之下瞻望這兀突於靑空中的鬥獸場眞像一個大髑髏一層層的殘缺的穹門像是髑髏上的窟洞不論是誰看了它都要想起爲甚麽緣故而建築起這樣奇怪的東西我從不曾想到羅馬鬥獸塲會有這樣宏大嚴峻的面目它雖然蒙着滿身的傷痕樑折壁圯非復原形然追想昔日那種最殘忍的鬥技的歷史以及敎徒慘死的情景眞是使人悚然發怔</p>
<p>在一千八百數十年前諦鐸帝造起這可容萬人廣厦的劇塲如今已經變了慘淡的廢墟了走進了裏面好幾百層斑剝殘缺的石級密密的排列着一直到巍巍的頂巔再朝下一望盤錯地排列着不少地窖有很深的有淺的這就是昔日蓄着猛獸的塲所我推想着當日許多獅虎和惡獸從這地窖中躍出來撲人的光景不覺打了幾個寒噤</p>
<p>希臘藝術對於這種穹窿的建築并没有給羅馬人以一個先例希臘化的東方雖然懂得穹窿但是没有用之於這樣大的建築鬥獸塲的穹窿爲往昔所未見精壁和穹窿接成一氣而無分裂的痕跡可尋每一個穹窿裏面點綴着石頭的雕像全部的形具有一種安定之感可惜這多雕刻現在已經毁壞很多了殘留着的也已經移到各美術館去了鬥獸塲是羅馬第一個能保存至今的大建築這種建築法旣經濟而又迅偼一個這麽大的鬥獸場只化十年的工夫惟是因此又鑄成了許多缺點後來許多建築家都批評說它只是一個裝飾的門面所以不能　之久遠但是文藝復興期的建築家也有意蹈上了這種覆轍</p>
<p>建於鬥獸塲的附近在蓊　葱翠的　樹之間屹然立着一座斑爛的白石的碑坊而顯着純粹模仿希臘的浮彫映入我們的視線裏面來這就是四世紀之初君工坦丁大帝Conslantinns於戰勝Maxence之後年建的凱旋門這是羅馬最大的凱旋門它是後來文藝復興時代一切藝術家晝家或彫刻家所崇拜的目的物它那浮雕的構圖興線的對稱的美實爲近代繪晝的先驅這白茫茫的似乎不易辨認的浮雕在殘缺中隱現着永久的生命成了羅馬彫刻史中唯一的建物而爲後人所景仰</p>

<h3 id="c240">路威士 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 謝富蘭</p>
<p>一九三○年諾貝爾文學奬得者</p>
<p>本月五日路透社從瑞典京城發來的電訊告訴吾們一九三○年的諾貝爾文學奬金决定奬給美國小說家路威士（Sinclar　Lewis）這筆獎金的數目共爲六千五百金鎊照目下匯價計算約値華幣十二萬元</p>
<p>路威士是一位風刺小說的著名作家在他的作品中把美國人分做好多類人們一經他的品評便覺確切不移雖則他在出版一部「大街」（Main　Streer）之</p>
<p>靠這後來一部的小說用他殘酷的筆描寫小城鎭裏的心理維妙維肖因此得在現代文學界上嶄露頭角</p>
<p>繼「大街」之後出版的便是「Babbit」時在一九二二年自這部書出就替那些在成功的知足的軌道上生活着的人們創造一個新名詞他對於人類譏諷的烙痕照現代的美國話講來正和　瀆神聖一般五年之後他又發表了一部「ElinerGautry」這一來無異予牧師團以當頭一棒不論那一位牧師和福音宣傳者都被這部書駡得狗血噴頭但是他對於文學上最有價値的供獻也許要推那部一九二五年出版的「箭匠」（Arrowsmibt）</p>
<p>這是一部叙述科學上的努力和掙扎的故事在這裏面路威士並不暴露科學家的愚行和弱點却是對於他們的工作和生活致一種眞誠的敬禮此外作品像「這位認識柯立芝的人」（The　Man　who　knews　Coolidge）「人阱」（Man　trap）及「Dodsworth」等也都傳誦衆口</p>
<p>路威士於一八八五年生於美國米内索太（Rinnesota）州的一個小城一九○七年在耶魯大學畢業得有文學士學位便在一家報館做訪員此後歷應「New　Hawen　Journal　&amp;　Couril」「San　Francisco's　Aulletin」以及聯合通訊社的聘請擔任這一類的工作再後他便成民「Tranglanric　Tales,　Volta　Roran　Frederich　A'Stokes　Co.　Adventure　Publisber's　Syndiclicate」的助理編輯並「George　H.　Doran　Co的編輯他的第一部小說發表於一九一四年題爲「吾們的連先生」（Our　Mr.　Hrenn）此外他並擔任許多短篇小說雜誌的選述他曾寫過一種劇本題爲「Hobohemai」於一九一九在紐約出版</p>
<p>路威士的作品在今日美國人間傳誦最是普徧當然討論他的人也是最多</p>
<h3 id="c241">德國劇壇漫話 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>今日的萊因哈德</p>
<p>略研究到舞臺的學問的怕没有人不知道這位大師的名字罷近代劇上阿比亞和戈登格雷和他三人實在留下了很大的功績但這位大師他目前還正從</p>
<p>事着甚麽工作呢</p>
<p>他自一九二二年爲經營上的困難辭去德意志劇塲的職務過後長時間息影在他查爾茲布克豪奢的别莊裏在他這擬聲息影靜窺劇壇形勢的中間他曾在維也納約遮夫斯塔多劇場導演過一回歌德的「斯蒂娜」這次的導演在維也納的演劇壇上得到非常値得紀念的成功同時給了奥大利劇壇以很大的影響</p>
<p>在這次的「斯蒂娜裏」他没有「活屍中的寫實主義也没有「坦東」中的民衆主義他離開代表狂暴與煩瑣的柏林的陰　的劇壇走進那今日一般旅行者尙想像地做十八世紀的都城的維也納在他心裏飽浸着這古風的國都的美這新發見的國都的堅實與優雅實吸引了他的心做北方人的他又難忘記那意大利式的（謝肉祭）的美因此他用他北方古典的質樸來調和那南國無邪氣的温柔的色彩使（斯蒂娜）的舞臺像古典的風的舞臺和他導演的「威尼斯商人」中間所表現的意大利仲夏夜的優　的情調一齊做了這方面成功的舞臺的代表演出這中間很看得出他一個轉換就是表示他天才的情緖已經浸入了莫查得的音樂的世界</p>
<p>兩年以來就傳着他要建一所劇塲來實現他這新的抱負經過一些波折他果然實現了他這劇塲的建築在落成這一天在包箱裏歡迎來了國務總理馬克司和外務交總長斯托勒惹茫這劇塲就在這天開了幕</p>
<p>萊因哈德存心要他劇塲裏復活那十八世紀的社交劇塲的形式他想使他主持的劇塲在柏林成一個優美的理想的新的社交劇場這劇塲内部的特包是在天井嵌着閃電一樣的薔薇色的管狀電燈廊下全是大紅的絨氈劇塲全體很小全部只容五百人中部可容三百人周圍二叚的包箱可容二百人製圖的建築師是在柏林建築過六所小劇塲的有名的奥斯開考弗滿</p>
<p>這劇塲全體的意匠是跟着萊因哈德的意見計書出來的最特色的是他那逹到社交劇塲的目的的小包箱劇塲内部絨氈垂幕舞臺的幕和椅子的塗色全是正紅的是月是草一樣的薄色到受了電燈的光都仿佛變成白色的時候這上部和下部恰成了兩個極端相反的顔色生出一種新奇的趣味每個包箱是只容四人的小室在小室外還附有一個小小的休息室</p>
<p>天井描着細細的金色的花紋正中垂着意匠着藤花的玻璃電燈中部的客席只月有十幾列舞臺對面的包箱位置着管弦樂隊觀客從正面觀劇却從背後或旁面聽音樂這都是塲内給人映象很深的特點</p>
<p>這全劇塲鮮明色彩的對照的配置最得到一般的好評包箱上下在薄卵色的壁上還繪着赤褐色的壁書瀟洒地點綴些中世紀風的熊飾和月光夜曲覆面之女武士等古風的故事的（Sketch）到處帶着維也納的情調中間採取了一點表現派的模樣這一切都充滿着輕快與微笑詼諧與優麗就是那萊因哈德在他成熟的藝境裏所持有的情操</p>
<p>萊因哈德給他這劇塲喧名呌「喜劇劇塲」</p>
<p>萊因哈德主持了這新的美的小劇塲造出那新的輕快的笑與明朗的優麗的雾圍怕這是德國戰後藝術復興中最値得人泩意的一個藝術復興罷</p>
<h3 id="c242">狂颷劇塲 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>民國九年十年中間正是德國表現主義在戲劇方面運動最猛烈的時候這中間最博人歡迎的連夜滿塲的戲劇是柏林國民舞臺托勒的「羣羣人間」的上演這</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>劇的背景及其他演出都完全是表現　的東西不久霍甫特曼的「白的聖者」的上演上面的墨西哥的背景也完全用的表現派的那種帶刺的山和樹這樣的裝置一直流行到别的裝飾上去像柏林郊外凡這地方的夏季游園地「路拉怕克」裏在滑走鐵道一帶裝置的山　正是這塗上色油的帶刺的劍一樣的山蜿蜒在那蒼茫的夏日的夜空裏像影繪一樣地聳着確是當地一個新奇的偉觀</p>
<p>在柏林街上月有表現派風的珈琲店與影戲院又有幾個跳舞塲在書店中間有標着「狂颷」的小書店在他裏面那常設的表現派或未來派繪書的常設展覧會是很動人耳目的在他的貨窗中間不消說陳設着很多很多的表現派書籍</p>
<p>「狂颷劇塲」就是由拿這書店做中心的文士書家產生的第一次出演的是此派重鎭的洛秦兒修來爾的「人間」公演的一日全塲滿座但一般人對這極尖端的表現派的演劇只是抱着驚異却不見得有十分的理解</p>
<p>這要轉換「德意志的悲哀」的表現主義使人從個人主義奮鬥的「超人世界」覺醒喊着「Der　Mensoch」（人道）來做這帶了充分的社會意識的藝術運動在演劇上收到此一切還成熟的效果「狂颷劇塲」極尖端表現派演劇的努力總不算是廢的罷（素）（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c244">法政學院光明社努力文字工作 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>大多數人都慣會這樣責駡靑年說「空口講白話」這在另一方面何嘗没有理由我們試看各學校的學術團體有多少是眞正把力量表現在實際工作上的什麽社什麽會一個一個如雨後春筍般發起可是工作呢除在開會時論爭着要怎樣怎樣地去進行外一下來就各顧西東單管着自已的玩意兒去了有的也只弄弄低徊趣的牆報作爲尋開心的生意經這種眞是表現了中國靑年的缺少紀律性啊也就是我們靑年的莫大恥辱</p>
<p>但現在法政學院光明社諸同學都不然完全一反了那病態先以以實際工作的表現爲初步着手本來從前我們並没有　見過有怎麽光明社也從没有看見過他們的一張宣言或佈告乃竟在法政學院組織小團體的蓬勃聲中突然發現了那張「光明半月刊」怎不使一般同學驚奇而旦在上海各學校中的小團體有能出版像這種利物的以我所知只有法學院法學研究會的法光了法政學院有這「光明」的刊物我想也未始不替本校增加體面的吧</p>
<p>在思想方面這張「光明半月刊」還能把握於正確的範圍中在「開塲白」中知道他們發行這張小小刊物的旨趣和伍務第一他們感覺得目前整個靑年界危險的現象正不知犧牲了多少𤍠血的靑年正不知有多少𤍠血的靑年做着醒獅夢開着倒車以自掘墳墓尤其是受到内戰匪禍以及金貴銀賤的影響一般的經濟地位起了動搖之象靑年失業和失學的兩重恐慌日形擴大因之整個的靑年界因着思想的不堅定除走上反動之路只看見徬徨頽廢以至於墮落於是他們認定這點的不滿意想來討論了靑年的一切本身問題第二他們感覺到目前的社會科學運動和文藝運動之流於畸形進展之病熊中實是異常的危險「我們萬不能提倡階級鬥爭以自致民族於死命因此我們惟有努力於民族主義的文藝運動消極的以反抗普羅文學積極的以喚醒民族意識促民族主議的實現而謀逹到整個民族自由平等的目的」第三個是牽涉到本身問題了</p>
<p>「我們覺感到諾大的法政學院從秋季開學以來爲時二日還很少見到任何學術的文藝的團體的刊物的發行實在空氣太沉悶了在生性好靜的同學們有圖書館自修室可作他們的樂園也許感受不到沿寂在已找到性的對象的同學們有公園戲院可供他們的狂歡蜜語也許不會感覺到苦悶可是此外一般的同學在這不甚流動的空氣裏總免不了感覺到沉寂和苦悶吧我們想借本刊的微弱的力量來扇動一動全院的空氣希望繼本刊之後有好多種價値的刊物出現」</p>
<p>這就是他們的光是的態度了他們在這樣光明的普照之下前進着</p>
<p>關於内容他們都是以嚴謹的態度來寫作的朱劍白的「學生自治會大綱質疑」是把中央所頒布的學生自治會大綱第六條規定「學生自治會之權力機關爲會員大會在會員大會閉會期間爲代表會在代表會閉會期間爲幹事會」依據法理法例事實三方面加以討論認爲是不甚適合的這種討論條例的文字我以爲很有價値的楊志剛的「對於親屬法的意見」是專討論學術的文字對於親屬法發揮得很精詳這篇是很長的長篇論文椿森的小說「一封信」本期祗載一些但在這一些中已表現得似乎太傷感一些了他的前記是說這封信係他的一個友人的這或許確實因爲我想椿森决不會再去寫這種傷感的文字的吧這篇大概是描寫舊禮敎掙扎下的一對戀人的事故希望下面的能稍趨於意志的鬥爭方面此外有朱愛人的詩「時代靑年」以及漢彬的「流氓與書獃子」萬邦的「婚姻戀愛等都値得一談以後逐步改進眞是一個有力的刊物呢</p>
<p>他們在發行後即分贈各敎職員同學頗受一般的讚賞云</p>

<h3 id="e2">Yan Still Controls Shanxi Politics <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Advises Feng Yuxiang Not to Leave Taiyuan</p>
<p>Concluding Various Military Agencies</p>
<p>Beiping: According to a telegram from Taiyuan, Yan went to Hewobian Village in Wutai yesterday at dawn. All telephone and communication agencies are operating as usual. Yan is still controlling Shanxi politics under the guise of resigning. Prominent figures in Tianjin believe that Feng's departure from the team and not going abroad is irrelevant. If Yan remains in Shanxi, he is still a dangerous political element. They suggest that the Northeast advise Yan to go abroad, and then Feng will naturally not stay in Taiyuan. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Sources from Taiyuan said that Yan visited Feng at the Chuanggong Temple a few days before leaving, asking Feng not to leave Taiyuan, saying that they had both issued statements about resigning and leaving the team, and it would not be too late to go abroad after the National Assembly is convened. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Foreign groups say that noteworthy points in Yan's resignation telegram include: first, he obeyed his father's order to return to the fields. Yan's father had also warned him against using troops before the war, so why didn't he listen then and only talked about obeying his father's order to return to the fields after his great defeat? Also, the statement "This commander-in-chief does not want to use force again" means that Yan has taken responsibility for this war. The phrase "lightly handing over the power of seven provinces to the provincial government" is a casual way to deal with a matter of national importance. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Pessimism Regarding the Disarmament Preparatory Committee <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Disarmament negotiations have lasted for five years, and this preparatory meeting is only the first step towards achieving perfect ideals, and if conflicts arise as soon as this meeting to achieve the first step towards ideals opens, then the fate of disarmament can be greatly predicted. Preparing for disarmament includes land, sea and air forces. Previously, the London Conference only partially solved naval affairs, and it was even more difficult to achieve the complete disarmament plan today. Everyone knows that the opinions between France and Italy on the naval issue are not compatible, but the opinions of various countries on land and air issues are still hidden and not obvious. Previously, when the League of Nations conference was held, Germany, Austria and Hungary did not vote on the disarmament plan because they did not specify the date of the conference, which was a slight revelation of their opinions. Now, when the preparatory meeting opened, the German representative stood up and made an impassioned speech, and the Russian representative also made a loud statement against meaningless talks. The situation in the meeting suddenly became tense. Although the Japanese representative mediated, there was no break, but their incompatible opinions became more obvious. As countries increasingly discuss disarmament, they become more suspicious, and as they debate more, their opinions become more divided. Germany and Russia are just starting to blame, and other countries with different views and wanting to express them will inevitably follow. Then, it is impossible to achieve a satisfactory result from this first step towards ideal, let alone to advance to the realization of this ideal in reality. The German representative said that now is not the time to deceive the world with empty words. I believe that the great powers may not necessarily have the intention of deceiving the world, but not treating each other with sincerity is indeed a major obstacle to the future of disarmament.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams II</p>
<h3 id="e10">Zhang Shusheng Sends a Telegram Advising Feng Yuxiang to Resign <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Zhang Shusheng recently published a telegram satirizing Feng Yuxiang's resignation. The full text is as follows: "Yuncheng, Shanxi, inquire about Mr. Feng, Second Brother Huanzhang. I bid farewell in late spring, and in the blink of an eye, it is autumn. How can the lush scenery suddenly change into a desolate scene? Contemplating the past and thinking about the present cannot help but make people cry bitterly. Brother, when I was imprisoned in Xiaoyi for six months, I read the Four Books of Confucius and Mencius every day. Every time I read that those who gain the Way receive much help, and those who lose the Way receive little help, and that with much help, the world will obey, and with little help, even relatives will betray, I don't know what it means. When I read that there should be no presumption, no arbitrary conclusion, no obstinacy, and no egoism, I don't know what it means even more. Alas, my stupidity is known only to you, brother, and my stubbornness is understood only by you, brother. Brother, although I don't understand the books of Confucius and Mencius, how dare I forget the name of filial piety and righteousness? But my parents are deceased, so what is the use of filial piety? Since brothers have no righteousness, what is the point? Alas, brother, my beloved brother, like a compatriot, since there is no place for filial piety and righteousness, and now it is the cold weather, it has been three years since I left you, I have not held an official position, and my house is bare, how can I survive the winter? Alas, brother, my brother with whom I have shared hardships for a long time, if today's weather is winter, will tomorrow's weather still be winter? If the weather north of the equator is winter, will the weather south of the equator also be winter? I am sure that this will not be the case. I deeply hope that you, brother, will temporarily sacrifice your political views for the sake of loving the people, and take me abroad to escape this winter and travel to spring places. If you grant me your kind consent, I will do my best to support you. I send this telegram in tears, not knowing what I am saying. I respectfully wish you good health and ask you to consider. Your brother, Zhang Shusheng, bows to you. Yu." (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting received newspaper reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs auditorium at 11:30 a.m. on the 7th and reported on the latest diplomatic situation as follows: (1) The French ambassador is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the 14th and will present his credentials after Chairman Chiang returns to Beijing. (2) Regarding the Tianjin Belgian Concession Agreement, according to Belgian sources, it is already on its way and will arrive in Beijing within days. It will be implemented after the exchange. (3) External speculation about the Sino-Russian conference is not true. Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Mo's representative saying that he is still continuing informal contacts with Karakhan, but there has been no significant development, so contacts are still ongoing. (4) The extraterritoriality issue is the biggest issue in Chinese diplomacy. If the extraterritoriality issue can be resolved, all other issues can be easily resolved. Therefore, whether China can be free and independent in the future is based on extraterritoriality. In the past, the progress of this matter was slightly slow due to military issues. Now, thanks to the spirit of the late Premier and the efforts of comrades in the front and rear, the rebellion of Yan and Feng has been suppressed. This is the time for diplomatic development. Therefore, if the extraterritoriality issue can be resolved, China's sovereignty can be completed. Recently, Ambassador Wu in the United States originally planned to return home to attend the Fourth Plenary Session because there was an opportunity for the extraterritoriality issue to develop. He has now decided to suspend his return home and consult with the U.S. Department of State. As for diplomatic development, it is determined by whether the country can be unified. In the final analysis, it still requires the people to unanimously advocate. (5) According to reports, Japanese police have withdrawn from the Wulongjing Village incident, but no official telegram has been received. The meeting ended. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Chairman Prevents the Russian Representative from Reading a Paper</p>
<p>News Reporters Unanimously Leave the Meeting to Protest</p>
<p>The Disarmament Negotiations Show No Progress</p>
<p>World Hopes Have Long Been Lost</p>
<p>German and Russian Representatives Sing the Tune of Active Disarmament</p>
<p>Geneva, June 6 (Guomin): The Preparatory Committee meeting for disarmament unfortunately turned out as expected. At the first meeting today, there was a fierce debate, and even the entire foreign press corps unanimously left the meeting to protest the Chairman's repeated refusal to allow Russian representative Litvinov to speak in French. Before this incident, the first fierce debate was caused by British representative Lord Cecil's motion not to approve any further discussion on the outline of the disarmament issue, requesting that the various items discussed in previous sessions be resubmitted and discussed one by one. Then, German representative Count Bernstorff came forward to protest, pointing out that the committee meetings often deviated far from the originally set principle of actually reducing armaments, saying that if this principle was not achieved, Germany would not accept any agreement. He also said that now is no longer the time for empty talk to deceive the world. The disarmament negotiations have been going on for five years without any real progress. The hopes initially cherished by countries around the world have long been lost. He also asked the audience to pay attention to the fact that the agenda of this session listed a German motion requesting the complete and public disclosure of the actual state of armaments of various countries. Now, he is also under the instruction of his government to request that the final disarmament conference be convened as soon as possible, because the current unrest in the world's human hearts is mostly due to the lack of agreement on disarmament. Russian representative Litvinov also opposed any further meaningless talks, claiming that Russia demanded that all countries realistically reduce their existing armaments by 50%, and that the wording "limitation of armaments" in official documents should also be changed to "reduction of armaments." After this debate, the unprecedented act of news reporters leaving the meeting occurred. Afterwards, based on the motion of Japanese representative Sato, it was resolved to first discuss the issues that had not been discussed, and then to discuss the entire draft disarmament treaty in detail, one by one, before adjourning the meeting until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Geneva, June 6 (Reuters): The Armaments Preparatory Committee held its seventh session today, chaired by Dutch representative Loudon. The preparatory committee decided not to make broad discussions but to focus on the articles of the disarmament convention. Russian representative Litvinov disobeyed the preparatory committee's decision and began to read a lengthy paper on disarmament. The Chairman ordered him to follow the order and did not allow his speech to be translated into French. The attending news reporters then withdrew from the meeting en masse. The UK proposed that if a country that has signed a disarmament convention is harmed by an organized rebellion, it may temporarily increase its peacetime armaments beyond the prescribed military strength, but must obtain the consent of the League of Nations Administrative Council. The UK also proposed the establishment of a permanent disarmament committee, which should be independent of the government and should inspect the work of the conventions and report to the League of Nations once a year. British representative Lord Cecil predicted that the preparatory committee would create revolutionary changes in the world, but advocated that there was no need to proceed too hastily and that there should be compromises on contentious points. Shortly thereafter, Russian representative Litvinov and Chairman Loudon clashed again over the failure to translate the Russian representative's nine-page speech into French. It was found that the Russian representative gave the speech in broken English, reiterating Russia's advocated active disarmament proposal. Because the paper was too long, it was not translated into French.</p>
<p>Geneva, June 6 (Reuters): The Executive Committee of the International Association of News Reporters has filed a protest with Loudon against the failure to translate the Russian representative's speech into French.</p>
<p>Rome, June 7 (Guomin): The newspapers here today have commented extensively on the debate in Geneva yesterday at the disarmament preparatory meeting, and have made various predictions about the success of the final disarmament conference next year. However, they all unanimously advocated that Italy should demand the amendment of the peace treaty and the uniform status of armaments. The Italian Popolo newspaper stated that the only obstacle to the convocation of the disarmament conference and the amendment of the peace treaty is France. It is important to know that consolidating the national foundation is not the prerogative of France alone. Other countries also have the right to properly protect their borders. Most of the victorious countries of the European War, such as the UK, the US, and Italy, unanimously maintain the request of Germany, Hungary, Austria, and Bulgaria to reduce their troops in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, but France has repeatedly violated its regulations, which in fact amounts to rendering it invalid.</p>
<p>Berlin, June 7 (Guomin): The newspapers here have greatly praised Count Bernstorff's advocacy at the Geneva conference for the early convocation of the final disarmament conference and for the prompt expression of opinions on disarmament by various countries. They have also unanimously supported the German representative's suggestion that various countries must reveal their actual troop reductions. The Berlin Daily News stated that the disarmament issue has entered a critical period. If it does not succeed, it will fail. There is no room for further procrastination. The German-Swiss Telegraph stated that all plans that can promote disarmament only need to be proposed to France.</p>

The speech was not discussed further, and the meeting adjourned. Furthermore, in the congressional break room, many Social Democrats questioned Emile Derode, the main writer of the nationalist newspaper "Liberté," for writing an article attacking Socialist leader Blanc, ultimately causing Derode to escape through a window. Two congressmen were injured by the broken glass.</p>

<p>Paris, June 6 (Reuters): The Adan Bank, one of the oldest banks in France, with over a hundred branches in northern France, has recently closed, shaking the market. French Prime Minister Taddéio is now personally trying to minimize the damage caused by this. Boulogne is the most affected, as its residents all have savings in the bank, resulting in a hundred fishing boats now temporarily suspended because the owners are unable to obtain funds to pay the crew. It is heard that the bank's assets are sufficient to cover its debts, and there is currently a proposal to liquidate the bank's assets. Several banks have also temporarily closed due to being implicated. The Rollet Province Bank has closed for liquidation, but it is heard that it has received assistance and may reopen tomorrow. This afternoon, the Austerlitz Bank, with a capital of 100 million francs, also closed. The spread of this news has increased public panic.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Hebei Provincial Government Implements Move to Tianjin <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since Wang Shuchang took office as Chairman of Hebei Province, the province has been at a standstill for many days because the provincial capital must be moved from Beiping to Tianjin. Although the Civil Affairs Department has already moved from Beiping, the other departments are scheduled to move to Tianjin today. The locations of the departments were previously decided to be the original sites of the provincial government in Tianjin. Currently, because most of the original sites of the departments have been occupied by troops and the houses have been severely damaged, there are no funds to repair them for a while. Therefore, new sites have been found again. The Finance Department has found the Liu Family Garden on Hebei Yuwei Road. The Construction Department has found the old site of the Electric Light Company along the river in Special District Two. The Agriculture and Mining Department plans to temporarily borrow the Russian Consulate in Special District Three. Since the Russian flag was lowered and the property handed over to the German Consul stationed in Tianjin after the Middle East Road incident, it is not yet known whether it can be borrowed. The Education Department has found the old site of the Zixin College on Ping'an Street, but the department has not yet completed the takeover, so it cannot come with the other departments today. Most of the department chiefs are in Tianjin, and they have sent their confidants to receive the assets in Beiping. Only 30-40% of the old personnel will be retained. Beiping has therefore added a large number of disaster officials. Most of the bureau chiefs and section chiefs of the collection agencies who were appointed during the Jin army era were dismissed and placed under surveillance for corruption. More than ten of the directors and section chiefs under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau have been dismissed and placed under surveillance by the new Director Zhang Xueming, accounting for about half of the total number of district heads. As many as seventy or so low- and mid-level patrol officers have been arrested. Provincial Government Chairman Wang Shuchang went to Shenyang with Finance Department Chief Yao Hong in the same car on the 17th of last month to report to Zhang Xueliang on the takeover of Beiping and Tianjin and to ask for instructions on future administrative policies. He only returned to Tianjin yesterday. His family and Chief Yao also came together, with three baggage cars behind the 102nd passenger train on the Beining Road. The train was delayed for up to ten hours due to being blocked by wind and snow along the way. After Wang got off the train, I inquired about the details of his trip to Zhang for instructions and the political and financial issues of Hebei Province. Wang replied that Zhang Vice Commander believes that the relationship between the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin is important and intends to decide on the candidates for mayor immediately, but it is not convenient to disclose who they are at this moment. Zhang has allowed for a moderate exemption of the various exorbitant taxes and levies in Hebei Province, but it must be decided after investigating the nature of each tax. As a result of the petition to Zhang by the representatives of the citizens of Beiping regarding the Chongwenmen Customs in Beiping, it is also hoped that the customs will be abolished. However, the customs revenue is mostly designated for Beiping education funding. Therefore, funds for education must be raised before the abolition can be implemented. As for the time and place of Zhang's meeting with Chairman Jiang, I had not yet decided when I left. (November 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Recent Situation of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Severe Shortage of Rolling Stock</p>
<p>Employees Urge Payment of Back Wages</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Communication: Since the Central Army successively captured Lanfeng, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang, on the Pinghan Line, one ordinary train runs daily between Zhengzhou and Hankou. A special express train departs from Zhengzhou every Monday and Wednesday, and from Hankou every Tuesday and Friday, each running twice a week. The Longhai Line suffers from a severe shortage of locomotives and passenger cars, with only one ordinary train running daily between Xuzhou and Luoyang. However, on the Zhengzhou-Luoyang section, Military Train No. 360, which departed eastward from Luoyang yesterday (30th), fully loaded with a certain division's troops, derailed at the west gate of the Yanshi station at 1:00 PM, damaging one locomotive, three vehicles, several railway tracks, and dozens of sleepers, causing a temporary interruption of traffic. The No. 6 passenger train bound for Zhengzhou was unable to depart. Currently, the railway bureau has dispatched personnel to rush to repair the damage, and it is expected that normal service will be restored soon. Due to the recent war lasting seven or eight months, many locomotives and rolling stock on both lines were seized by various armies, and many were damaged, resulting in a severe shortage of rolling stock. In most cases, factory vehicles are used as temporary replacements. The one or two tarp-covered vehicles available are also dilapidated and unable to provide adequate shelter from the wind and rain. Moreover, with few vehicles and many passengers, there is no room to stand after each train departs. Consequently, some passengers climb onto the locomotive, others cling to the footboards, and still others sit around on the roofs of the carriages. During rainy days, all passengers are drenched to the bone. At night, they suffer even more from the biting cold due to frost and dew. This is a common complaint among travelers who deeply lament the difficulty of traveling. Furthermore, the Zhengzhou-Xinxiang section has been opened to traffic. Li, a councilor from Sun Lianzhong's troops stationed in Hebei, was dispatched by the Zhengzhou Military Headquarters to inspect troop conditions and returned to Zhengzhou by train from Xinxiang yesterday (30th) due to the completion of his inspection duties. It is also reported that preparations are underway to fully open the Pinghan Railway for north-south traffic, and it is expected that this will soon be realized.</p>

<p>He Jingwu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, and Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, have both concurrently served as Transportation Commanders for their respective railways. With the end of military operations, preparations are underway to transfer all military transport matters on both railways back to the management of the railway bureaus. However, the Longhai Railway Bureau and the Zhengzhou Pinghan Railway Workers' Union report that railway employees and workers have been in arrears with their salaries for half a year, resulting in extremely difficult living conditions. Employees of the Longhai Railway Bureau fear that excessive accumulation of salary arrears will make it difficult to recover them, and have established a Salary Arrears Liquidation Committee to demand compensation from the railway bureau. In addition, the Pinghan Railway Workers' Union, due to the inability of workers to maintain their livelihoods, recently submitted a document to He Yingqin, head of the Zhengzhou Military Headquarters, requesting assistance. It is reported that He has forwarded the original document to the railway bureau for proper handling. (October 31st)</p>
<p>&lt;Cao Fulin Supervises Troops Heading East&gt;</p>
<p>Monitoring Sun and Gao's Troops for Demobilization and Reorganization</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Military affairs in Shandong have long concluded. Although there are still a few bandit gangs sporadically looting in various counties of eastern Shandong, the local garrisons are sufficient to suppress them, and there seems to be no need to mobilize large forces. However, the other day, Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu suddenly ordered Cao Fulin, commander of the 14th Army, to lead troops eastward to pacify the bandit troubles in Jiaodong. He also ordered the 22nd Division, 29th Division, 73rd Division, and 74th Division to be under Cao's command and dispatch, and they departed overnight as if facing a major enemy. Feeling that the matter was sudden, I took a train to Jiaoxian yesterday (3rd) to visit Commander Cao and inquire about the reason for this dispatch of troops. The details of my interview are recorded below:</p>
<p>Troop Deployment: Cao's troops are heading east in two routes. The 73rd Division, commanded by Zhan Shutang, disembarked at Gaomi and proceeded to the Zhucheng area. The 22nd Division, commanded by Gu Liangmin, and the directly subordinate units of the 14th Army disembarked at Jiaoxian and proceeded to Rizhao and other places. Earlier, a unit of Zhan's division stationed in Jiaoxian was ordered to depart from Jiaoxian to Gaomi on the night of the 1st, and followed the army. At 6:00 AM on the 2nd, a train full of soldiers from the 65th Brigade of the 22nd Division arrived in Jiaoxian. After a short rest, they were led southward by Brigade Commander Tang Yaoxun. At 10:00 AM, another train arrived, led by Commander Cao, carrying directly subordinate units, including a cavalry battalion, an artillery battalion, and a pistol battalion. After Cao disembarked, he took a car into the city and temporarily resided in the 14th Army headquarters. The cavalry and artillery battalions immediately proceeded forward. The pistol battalion remained in Jiaoxian to maintain defense. The "Taishan" armored train followed behind and was expected to arrive in Jiaoxian around the night of the 3rd.</p>
<p>Resolving Gao's Troops: At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, I visited Commander Cao, but Cao was out. Wang Yabo, a staff officer from the army headquarters, received me in his place. I asked what the mission of the army's eastward deployment was. Wang said that the army came because there were unsettling rumors about the remnants of Gao Jianbai's troops stationed in Rizhao. Chairman Han specifically ordered the army to go and resolve Gao's troops. Tang's brigade has already advanced southward from Jiaonan to the Haizhou area, and the 26th Army, commanded by Chen Yaohan, has been ordered to intercept them to prevent them from fleeing south. They have now received a telegram from Gao's troops expressing their willingness to obey the provincial government's orders for demobilization and reorganization. This matter is expected to be resolved peacefully. I also asked if Commander Cao was going south. Wang replied that Commander Cao plans to temporarily reside in Jiaocheng and has telegraphed Chairman Han about the handling of the situation. Whether he goes south will be determined after receiving the Chairman's telegram. I also asked if the personnel from the Eight Grand Bureaus had come as well. Wang replied that personnel from various bureaus had brought a part of the assistance, including Chief of Staff Wang Shiqi, Chief of the Staff Department Su Erchang, Adjutant Cao Jinming, and Military Law Director Li Xiuren. Wang solemnly declared that there were many misunderstandings outside regarding this dispatch, which they did not understand. During this period of military conclusion, if bloodshed can be avoided, it will be a blessing for the people. If various miscellaneous troops can repent and surrender, Chairman Han will never blame the past to show leniency.</p>
<p>Readjusting Sun's Troops: It is heard that this time Cao's eastward deployment is not only to resolve Gao's troops but also to supervise Sun Silang's troops stationed in Zhucheng. Sun's troops were originally reorganized from the Jiaoxian bandit army led by Ji Xiaoxi. After Ji was executed, the troops were commanded by Sun, numbering about a thousand people, and stationed in Zhucheng. Recently, Chairman Han ordered Sun's troops to proceed to Jinan to await demobilization and reorganization, but Sun delayed in complying. Therefore, Chairman Han ordered Cao to lead troops to supervise their departure. Now, Zhan's division has successively arrived in Zhucheng territory. Knowing that resistance is impossible, Sun's troops have expressed their willingness to go to Jinan to await demobilization and reorganization. It is also reported that a unit has already arrived at the Gaomi station to wait for trains to go west, and the rest are successively departing. It is heard that Commander Cao will transfer the divisions back to their original defenses after Gao and Sun's troops have actually undergone demobilization and reorganization, and return to the province to report on his mission (October 4th).</p>
<p>Hunanese Urge the Completion of the Yuehan Railway</p>
<p>Raising Civil Shares in Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces</p>
<p>To Be Returned to the Central Government After Fifteen Years</p>
<p>Changsha Communication: The Yuehan Railway spans over two thousand li and is crucial to the commerce of Hunan, Guangdong, and Hubei provinces. Among them, the Zhushao section (from Zhuzhou in Hunan to Shaoguan in Guangdong), measuring eight hundred and ninety li, remains unfinished. Furthermore, over eight million yuan in principal and interest of civil shares (i.e., rice and salt public shares) owed to the Hunan section have not been repaid. Four-fifths of the Zhushao section lies in Hunan, so the Hunanese are the most affected and the most eager to complete it. As the Fourth Plenary Session is scheduled to open on the 12th of this month, the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee has specifically requested the prompt completion of the Yuehan Railway to develop production in the southeast. At the same time, the Hunan branch of the Yuehan Railway Promotion Association has also formulated a plan to complete this road. The plan proposes that the people of Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces temporarily raise shares to build it, and after fifteen years, the government will prepare funds to recover it for direct management, so that the principle of railway nationalization is not contradicted, and the road can be completed early with the help of the people. The method of raising funds jointly borne by the three provinces has been drafted and submitted to the Fourth Plenary Session for adoption and implementation yesterday. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the Guangdong and Hubei branches of the Yuehan Railway Promotion Association, requesting consistent support. The proposed methods for completing the railway through civil shares and for raising funds are recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Temporary Methods for Completing with Civil Shares: (1) Designate the people of Hunan, Guangdong, and Hubei provinces to raise shares. The Central Government will send one or two experts in engineering to supervise the project and its materials. According to the unfinished line, only Hunan and Guangdong provinces are responsible. According to the benefits of completion, all three provinces will benefit. Hunan already has nearly 10 million yuan of rice and salt public shares as a base. Merchants in Guangdong and Hubei are wealthy. Raising over 30 million yuan will be as easy as turning one's hand. (2) Set a deadline of four or five years for completion. (3) Stipulate that fifteen years after the completion and opening of traffic, the road will be returned to the central government for direct management (returning it at the shortest possible time limit). This can avoid capitalists from monopolizing it from the middle, which does not hinder the capital restriction program. Moreover, after fifteen years, the central government will obtain this road without labor, which is not only indistinguishable from nationalization but even better than nationalization. (4) Quickly return the rice and salt public shares to Hunan Province to serve as a fund for the Hunan section. (5) Please allocate a few tenths of reliable central funds to supplement the insufficient strength of the people as government capital.</p>
<p>(B) Methods for Raising Funds in the Three Provinces: (1) The total cost of the entire line, the Zhushao section, which is 445 kilometers long, equivalent to 890 Chinese li, regarding engineering materials, construction, and other expenses, is set at 45 million yuan. Calculated on the basis of completion in five years, 9 million yuan is needed each year. (2) The approximate amount allocated to the three provinces is calculated annually. Guangdong will bear 2 million yuan, totaling 10 million yuan in the above numbers. Hubei will bear 2 million yuan, totaling 9 million yuan in the above numbers. (Note: The Guangdong section is shorter than the Hunan section, but the allocated amount is greater than Hunan's because Guangdong is a wealthier area and fulfillment is easier. Moreover, the commerce of Hubei merchants will receive equal benefits once this road is open, so they cannot but have the obligation to take shares.) (3) Hunan's fundraising methods: I. Under the port tax, Taiwan, Sichuan, Huai, and Guangdong salt taxes are calculated to yield about 400,000 yuan annually. (Note: This donation originated at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The prescribed use was to build the Yuehan Railway. Later, the road was not built and the donation was not stopped. All the annual income was transferred to the central government for other uses. The central government should approve the recovery of the original port tax. Moreover, the salt tax surcharge is no less than 400,000 yuan per month, all of which goes to the central government. It should be appropriate to slightly transfer it.) II. Under the public shares, the principal of the long-owed rice and salt public shares should have been returned long ago. Last year, the Yuehan Railway Promotion Association submitted a request to the provincial government to forward it to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications for repayment to replenish the Hunan road fund. It was once approved for repayment. Later, after investigation, the number of public shares actually received and owed was only over 8 million yuan. Although the government is unable to repay the full amount, repaying 200,000 yuan per month from the national treasury should be within the possible range. A total of 2.4 million yuan can be obtained annually, and the full amount can be repaid in three years. III. Under the additional items, an additional 2.7 million yuan can be collected annually from land tax, likin, and miscellaneous taxes. (Note: This fund was originally designated for the construction of the highway. Now that the road bureau has been reorganized and incorporated into the province, this fund has been discontinued. It is proposed to extend it for two years and transfer it to Yuehan Railway shares, but the extension is stipulated from the start of construction to the fourth year, when the rice and salt public shares have been fully repaid.) IV. Under the designated items, the provincial government will designate 50,000 yuan per month, totaling 600,000 yuan annually. (Note: If Hunan's taxation is seriously rectified and the long-standing malpractices are eliminated, an additional 500,000 to 600,000 yuan can be collected annually, which is also expected. Designating this number is also negligible.) V. Under the fundraising items, Hunan's commercial circles, such as the Changsha, Hongjiang, Changde, Jinshi, Hengzhou, Xiangtan, and Yiyang chambers of commerce, and mining merchants and Huai merchants, can raise 500,000 yuan annually if they entrust road shares. The completion of this road will not only avoid the losses from the Communist bandits' donations, but also the development of commerce will surely yield several times the benefits. They will enthusiastically transport and strive to be the first. Calculating the above items only on the Hunan side, over 4 million yuan can be obtained annually in the first two or three years, and over 3.67 million yuan can be obtained annually in the fourth and fifth years, which is more than a million yuan or six or seven hundred thousand yuan more than the original quota. Listing this number is to prevent insufficient coverage, in order to use it as a supplement. Guangdong is a wealthy area and Hankou is a commercial center. Raising the number of shares allocated annually is easier and requires no other consideration. Therefore, the above is omitted. In short, no matter where the funds are collected from, stocks will be issued uniformly. How to give interest each year, how to distribute dividends per share, and how to end the central government's recovery at a price after fifteen years will be planned after the company is established, and regulations will be formulated for compliance (November 4th).</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Andong Customs House is Destroyed by Ronin <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Reason Originated from Investigating Tax Evasion</p>
<p>Customs Officer Mr. Yang is Severely Injured</p>
<p>Andong Communication: Andong port has the reputation of being a hub for tax evasion, known throughout the world. Adjacent to the border of Korea, separated only by the Yalu River, tax evasion is extremely convenient and difficult for customs to investigate. There are also so-called "affiliated territories" that are beyond the reach of Chinese administrative police power. Japanese ronin take advantage of this special region to secretly organize tax evasion groups, employing thousands of Korean coolies to specialize in smuggling goods in and out of Andong and Sinuiju. Every night, countless small boats smuggle fabrics and silks from Sinuiju to Andong, numbering around a hundred small boats. According to customs officers' investigations, countless small boats full of piece goods are seen departing from Sinuiju in the evening, and by the next morning, they have all disappeared without a trace. The boats transport the empty goods after the night when the customs patrol ships return to port and land on the seven islands in the affiliated territory in Andong, then transport them to the inland for sale. Customs Superintendent of Andong Pilasolak determined that the customs losses were too great, and not only transferred additional inspectors from other ports to Andong for severe inspection this year but also recruited more than a dozen customs inspectors to help patrol. The Japanese tax evasion group then slightly curbed its activities. However, these ronin not only did not repent but harbored resentment. In July of this year, they threw customs officer He into the Yalu River to vent their anger. Fortunately, Mr. He was well-versed in swimming, so even though he drifted for forty minutes, he was able to escape. Recently, because the market price of gold bars differs greatly from the exchange rate, the group smuggled gold bars out of the country to profit from the difference. However, because the opportunity was not hidden, the customs seized several cases a month ago, totaling more than 1,300 taels. These ronin then resented the customs to the bone and instigated the Japanese police station in the affiliated territory to interfere, arresting the customs officer in the police station on the false charge of carrying weapons and violating the treaty. The Japanese Consul then came out to protest, prohibiting customs personnel from exercising their duties in the affiliated territory. Unexpectedly, the Customs Superintendent Pilasolak not only did not show weakness and submit but declared that he would transfer this case to the central government for resolution through diplomatic means. Thus, their plan failed again. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ronin became even more ferocious. A few days ago, when the customs seized gold bars, a sudden mob of hundreds of people completely destroyed the windows, glass, and furniture of the Chinese customs house. The Japanese police station stood by and watched. The other day, when the customs seized another batch of gold bars and were inspecting them, a sudden mob of hundreds of people came with steel knives, sticks, bricks, and stones, indiscriminately beating any customs officers they saw. Some customs officers escaped, some had swollen heads and broken skin, and Mr. Yang Shuqi was brutally cut off his right hand by a thug. At that time, blood flowed like a fountain and he fainted on the ground. Seeing that they had caused a disaster, the mob scattered in a riot. Mr. Yang is now in the hospital in critical condition and it is difficult to predict whether he will survive. At the time, several Japanese policemen were on the scene and deliberately avoided going when they saw the thugs approaching. After seeing that the man had been killed (because Yang fell to the ground and they all said he was dead), they came out to disperse the mob and capture the murderers. However, the local Japanese newspaper does not acknowledge that the murderer has been caught. They are afraid that if Yang dies, they will have to go through the motions of handling a few years of imprisonment under the law. It is better to insist that the murderer is at large, so they don't have to go through the motions at all (November 2nd).</p>

<p>Unreasonable Trouble by Wounded Soldiers: There are approximately several hundred wounded soldiers receiving treatment at the 17th Rear Hospital in Huqiu, Suzhou. Yesterday (7th) morning, wounded soldiers in the hospital, dissatisfied with the quality of the meals and vegetables, used this as an excuse to cause trouble for Director Xu, demanding improved treatment, resulting in an uncontrollable conflict. Director Xu telegraphed Jiang Xiaoxian, commander of the 4th Garrison Regiment in Fengqiao, Suzhou, requesting that a team be dispatched immediately to suppress them. Commander Jiang immediately dispatched military police. Unexpectedly, the wounded soldiers continued to cause trouble unreasonably. The military police opened fire with more than ten rifles, and the wounded soldiers finally calmed down. At 4:00 PM, the military police arrested 16 wounded soldiers who were the ringleaders of the disturbance and escorted them back to the regimental headquarters for disposition.</p>
<p>Execution by Strangulation of a Parricide: Wang Jinbao, a resident of Jiading, 32 years old, was sentenced to death for killing a member of his senior family and killing an unknown soldier.

<p>A Robber Who Snatched Jewelry is Arrested on the Spot: A female worker named Chen Xiaomei worked at a silk factory outside the South Gate. The other day (afternoon), Xiaomei finished work at the factory and was going home when she suddenly encountered a robber named Dai Awun stopping her on the road at Caobu Bridge, snatching a gold ring from Xiaomei's hand. At that time, Xiaomei immediately shouted for help and was slapped several times by the robber, causing her face and other places to be bruised, swollen, and bleeding. Afterwards, Xiaomei reported to Wang, the head of the Third Public Security Bureau in charge. After receiving the report, Wang immediately dispatched armed police officers to pursue and arrest the robber Dai Awun and bring him to the bureau. Head Wang opened the court for a preliminary hearing. The suspect Dai provided cunning words and firmly denied the robbery. Yesterday, a document was prepared and submitted to the Branch Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>An Investigation is Requested for Fraudulent Acquisition of Wealth: The locals Long Yunzhang and Huang Cangyu had a deep friendship and both worked in the National Road Construction Association, distributing books and newspapers in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. All accounts were handled by Huang Cangyu. This summer, Long Yunzhang suddenly fell ill and immediately handed over 400 yuan of promotional book fees under his personal name to Huang Cangyu for transfer to the Shanghai General Association's Book Department under Long Yunzhang's name. Unexpectedly, Huang was ill-intentioned and remitted all the money under his own name. It wasn't until August that the General Association asked Long for the money that Long realized he had been deceived. He then pursued Huang Cangyu for the previous money, but Huang did not admit that he had previously owed the money. Long Yunzhang was weak and helpless after being repeatedly deceived. Yesterday, he submitted a report to the county government requesting investigation.</p>
<p>A Shocking Incident of Robbery, Kidnapping, and Extortion: The fifteenth district (Qingcheng City), Lianrong Town, North Qifang area is densely populated with shops, and transportation is very convenient. There is a slightly resident Hua Jinhan, who previously served as a city director of Qingcheng City and a prefect of Taizhou. He has a wealth of property, owning four to five thousand mu of good land. His residence is a five-bay facade house facing north, and he also has a huge house under the Liulong Bridge in the city. Hua is now eighty-one years old and has a wife and a concubine. His wife died long ago, and his concubine Xue is fifty years old. His wife bore two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Zhongfan, is forty years old and currently runs a Yuanfengsheng grocery store in Beiqifang, which is doing well. The second son, Rongsheng, is thirty years old and previously served as a secretary in Zhu Zhijun's Public Security Bureau. Both brothers are married. Hua's eldest daughter, Xiangying, also known as Miss San, is over thirty years old and has not yet married. Rongsheng often lives in the main house under Liulong Bridge in the city. However, Hua Jinhan has been suffering from dementia for many years and is unable to move. The silver and money in the house are all managed by his daughter Xiangying. Unexpectedly, around ten o'clock on the night before last (6th), twenty to thirty bandits speaking the Jiangyin dialect suddenly came. They were wearing long and short clothes, resembling rural people, and each was holding a pistol, box cannon, knife, stick, electric flashlight, and other weapons. After arriving in the town, they dispersed guards to prevent pedestrians from passing through and cut the telephone lines connecting the town, cutting off communications. The rest of the bandits went to Lian in the east and struck Hua Jinhan's house hard door. At that time, there was a thief stealing the cabbage planted by Hua's family. The bandits immediately grabbed him and forbade him to speak out. Since Hua's door was closed, the bandits used a bamboo pole to climb over the wall from outside and enter the courtyard and immediately fired a few shots to show off their power. At that time, Hua Jinhan had already been awakened from his dream and was in a state of panic. Xiangying and the fourth lady immediately fled to a neighboring house of the same clan to hide in the attic. After entering, the bandits immediately went through the rooms and searched everywhere and chased them to Jinhan to tell the location of the hidden ocean. They were robbed of 200 yuan in cash, and the clothes and jewelry in the boxes and kitchens were all robbed, totaling a loss of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>In addition, Tandan's deeds (which are mortgaged to the Hua family) and bank-books were all robbed. Unexpectedly, the bandits were still not satisfied after being full, so they tied up Hua's concubine Xue. At the same time, they found that Hua Xiangying's sisters were hiding next door, so they immediately went to look for them and used an electric flashlight to light them up. See Xiangying and drag her upside down and tie her away. When the bandits were leaving, they said to the principal Hua Jinhan: Prepare 20,000 yuan in cash and come and pick it up. When you contact us, we will have a letter to notify you within these three days. After speaking, they opened the door and went out to fire shots as a demonstration, shouting and going to Zhangcun浜 on the border of Wuxi and Cheng, and escorted Hua Xue and Hua Xiangying into the bandit ship and drove towards Jiangyin. It was also heard that the bandits originally planned to bind Hua Jinhan, but after asking Hua's concubine Xue to beg for help, she was willing to replace her husband with herself, so the bandits tied up Xue and Xiangying and left.</p>
<p>The Liyang Old String Embezzlement Case will be Transferred to the Court for Investigation: The Liyang County Bureau's Old String Embezzlement Case involves members of the party department and local bullies. There are already eleven people who have been arrested and sent to the province. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Rectification Committee discussed the arrest of Shi Taorong, Shi Qinglian, and Hu Jinghua, who are in custody in Liyang County. After the arrest, it was proposed that the three men were suspected of major offenses in the case. After discussion, it was decided to suspend the party department's position. Although Shi and others submitted two documents, they have been trying to defend the case, but the documents have not been approved. On the afternoon of the 6th, Qian Jiaxiang, section chief of the Provincial Government's Third Section, went to the Provincial Public Security Bureau with a staff member to interrogate Shi Taorong and others. Shi and others cited past participation in the revolutionary work, and asked the provincial government to investigate the matter in detail and punish the embezzlement personnel to prove that they did not pay bribes. After an hour of research, there were no results. Wang Pingling, the whistleblower in this case, arrived in the town a few days ago, and representatives of the Liyang Township Association in Beijing, Xie Pengnian, Zhang Dasan, and Huang Huaizhen, went to the provincial government to petition, requesting that the case be thoroughly investigated and severely punished to purify the palace, and listed the eleven people who were arrested and in custody in three categories: (1) Pan Bin, Shen Zhiqing, and Huang Xingan are suspected of embezzlement; (2) Zheng Chengyuan, Cao Qingzhi, Di Zhen, Shi Taorong, Shi Qinglian, and Hu Jinghua are suspected of bribery; and (3) Ren Shuchun and Zhou Shi are suspected of knowing the situation, and requested that the above persons be transferred to the judiciary for thorough investigation and strict interrogation to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Please Extend the Canal Dredging Route: The budget for dredging the Wujin section of the canal by the Wuyi Construction Bureau is 300,000 yuan. The original route starts from Benniu and ends at Qishuyan, with a length of over fifty li. All facilities have been determined, and bidding for the project will be invited on the 15th of this month for construction to begin. Yesterday (6th), merchants and farmers from Henglin jointly submitted a request to the county government for construction, requesting that the dredging route be extended from Qishuyan to east of Henglin. Their reason is that the canal dredging is called Wujin section, and Henglin is also within the scope of Wujin section, and the river is shallow, and they have the same obligation for water conservancy funds. How can they be alone?</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the county bureau will submit it to the Canal Dredging Committee for review and decision.</p>

<p>In Xiyang Town, Fushan District of this county, which borders the Yangtze River, bandits appear and disappear unpredictably. The locals have become accustomed to it and are not at all vigilant. Unexpectedly, around 12 o'clock the night before (the 5th), more than twenty pirates landed from the riverbank and swarmed into the home of traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhang Chengqi, demanding silver dollars. Zhang replied that he had no money, and if they insisted, he requested that they set a date and address so he could have time to raise the funds and pay them the full amount. The pirates refused and immediately began looting, obtaining only a little over twenty silver dollars and some clothing.</p>
<p>The pirates, still unsatisfied, then kidnapped Zhang. Upon exiting the Zhang residence, they saw the house of Zhang Baoqi, a farmer on the opposite bank, which looked quite good, and mistakenly assumed it was a wealthy household. They went around to the other side of the river, broke down the door, and ransacked the place, only to find a few dozen copper coins. Thereupon, they kidnapped the sixty-four-year-old farmer Zhang Baoqi and his six-year-old son as well.</p>
<p>Next, they went to the home of Qian Yongkang in town, who ran a cotton business. He had recently returned from Donglai Town in the Nansha District with over nine hundred silver dollars worth of goods, which were all stolen. Afterward, they went to the home of a Qiu surname, stealing over two thousand silver dollars in total.</p>
<p>Seeing that there were no more homes to rob, the bandits took their hostages and returned to the riverbank. They encountered three sentries from the port's customs patrol boat. The pirates rushed forward and bound the sentries. The sentries begged and pleaded before they were released, but their firearms and ammunition were all taken. Then, the pirates boarded their boat and headed north.</p>
<p>After the incident, according to townspeople, before the pirates arrived in town, they had sent several men to pry open the public telephone to prevent the news from leaking. Furthermore, the fishermen guarding the crab weirs said that when the pirates came, Zheng Yushan, a migrant from Wangshi Town, held an electric torch and led the way.</p>
<p>Currently, the victims have reported the matter to the Fushan District Office and have also telegraphed the county government requesting a rescue of the hostages.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Explaining the Truth of the Turmoil and the Standards for Selecting a President "Disturbing Situation" <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The undercurrents between the National Central University Student Union and the National Central University Student Association: The students of National Central University held a meeting the other day to make suggestions regarding the presidential issue and to prevent all activities of the current National Central University Student Union, forming a special committee to handle all the resolutions of the general assembly, which was deemed legal. However, the National Central University Student Union believes that the number of people present at the fourth and subsequent resolutions of the general assembly was insufficient, making the resolutions illegal, causing a dispute between the two sides. Separate declarations were also made externally. The National Central University Student Union also sent representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday (the 7th) to request the cessation of the activities of the presidium of the National Central University Student Association general assembly, Liu Shichao, Tang Ziquan, and Tu Juyou. The declarations of both sides are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Declaration of the First Student General Assembly <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<h3 id="e114">(1) The Course of the Current Turmoil <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and this university was reorganized, three years have passed. During these three years, the name of this university has changed several times, the funding of this university has been shaken several times, and the administrative system of this university has been reorganized several times due to the revision of the University Organization Law. To this day, it has not left the initial stage. During this period, all administrative matters have not been on track, and the results obtained are far from expectations. The students of this university deeply know that an ideal university cannot be achieved in two or three years. This phenomenon is inevitable in the initial stages of general universities in the country. However, feeling the ardent expectations of society and the importance of our own mission, we have always been deeply vigilant. For three years, the students of this university have sought to strengthen the foundation of the university externally and have prepared for the progress of the university internally. This is also the initial intention of this movement to improve university affairs.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, students Tu Juyou and others initiated a movement to improve university affairs with the backing of more than six hundred students. Although the issues involved were very numerous, and there were criticisms against one or two staff members, it was nothing more than a manifestation of their love for the university and their desire to work hard and make progress, which could represent the psychology of all students. Even the means they took did not exceed the permissible scope. The students of this university believed that this legitimate request would be accepted by the university. Therefore, after making the request, they waited quietly for the university's reply and did not expand the turmoil. However, Xu Zicheng and others suddenly responded to Tu and others' proposal by soliciting student signatures. The next day, when Xu and others submitted the proposal to the president, they added additional clauses, and some matters involved individuals. Therefore, students who had signed Xu and others' proposal declared that it was inconsistent with their original intention of signing, and the unanimous opinion among the students suddenly became divergent. The next day, President Zhang resigned and went to Shanghai, merging the original three academic affairs offices into the General Affairs Office, appointing Huang Pu as the Director of General Affairs. The entire student body and faculty of this university believed that changing the administrative organization of the university without formal approval from the academic affairs meeting was inappropriate, and this incongruous General Affairs Office fundamentally conflicted with the University Organization Law, so they insisted on opposing it. Huang disregarded the situation and rashly took office on October 27th. During Huang's report at the memorial week ceremony, students questioned him, and Huang could not answer, so he announced that he would no longer be responsible for National Central University. This is the general course of the current turmoil.</p>
<h3 id="e115">(2) Our Current Attitude <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Although this university has been spared from disintegration in this precarious situation, the government has no solution for the time being, and opportunists are trying to take advantage of it. Therefore, leaflets under false pretenses are often found on campus, and malicious attacks with ulterior motives are rising outside the university, confusing right and wrong. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the entire student body of this university had to give it a clear and correct correction. Therefore, on November 5th, a general assembly was held, and the following points were unanimously resolved as a solemn expression: (1) Before the presidential issue is resolved, although the university affairs are temporarily maintained by the joint agreement of the deans, the students should also organize a special committee to be responsible for handling all resolutions of the general assembly. All groups that have not been formally recognized by the general assembly, such as the previous committee to protect the university movement and the committee to rescue the university and eliminate traitors, should be denied the right to express opinions to the outside world in order to maintain the dignity of the university and prevent exploitation by villains. (2) All the students of our university deeply know the mission they bear and are now focusing on attending classes. The presidential issue can only be resolved by waiting for the reasonable solution from our government. After several discussions, we also feel that it is necessary to propose the following standards for the successor: First, someone who is respected by the public for their academic and moral standing and has no bureaucratic habits; second, someone who can focus on their duties and has the determination and ability to develop National Central University; (3) someone who has achieved success in running higher education; (4) someone with a considerable history in the Party and the country. The entire student body of our university believes that the above provisions are the minimum standards that a university president should have. We will make every effort to achieve them with determination. Any successor who meets these standards, we will vow to support with all our strength. Any president who does not meet these standards, we will vow to oppose with all our strength. The entire student body of our university has no personal preferences, but we have the greatest determination for the development of the university's future.</p>
<h3 id="e116">(3) Hopes for Social Figures and the Government <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>This university is now in a critical situation. The entire student body deeply knows that social figures and government authorities are criticizing us because of their excessive expectations for this university. Rumors are spreading, some believe that the university's academic atmosphere is corrupt and its ideology is mixed, and some even believe that it is a battleground for nationalists and communists. The entire student body now wants to declare to society that our university has not dared to lag behind in implementing the Three Principles of the People education in recent years. All students know their responsibilities are heavy and are aware of self-encouragement. Since the turmoil at our university began a month ago, all students and faculty have attended classes as usual, waiting for a legal solution from the government, and there are no such facts as rumored by the outside world. We firmly believe that if the government authorities have a long-term vision, they will fully adopt the standards for the selection of a president that we have proposed in order to promote academics and make a prompt and wise decision. National Central University is located in the capital and is observed by China and foreign countries. The entire student body vows to work hard for the development of its future with twelve points of determination and perseverance and hopes that social figures and government authorities will provide deep support for this determination and perseverance. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Declaration of the Student Union <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<h3 id="e118">Executing Legal Proposals in the Resolutions of the General Assembly <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<h3 id="e119">Denying Illegal Proposals After the Quorum of the General Assembly Was Lacking <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, since disputes arose over university affairs, the school has been full of crises and dangerous situations. The newspapers have been noisy, and the public has been panicked. However, our students have remained calm in the face of chaos with a genuine love for the school, so the sounds of music have not been interrupted, and villains have not been able to succeed. Since President Zhang telegraphed his firm resignation, the school has been in a state of panic due to the lack of anyone responsible. In view of this, the student union has repeatedly asked the government to resolve the presidential issue as soon as possible to avoid neglecting studies. The general assembly on the 5th of the month was also intended to concentrate the will of all students to jointly seek the safety of the school. More than eight hundred people attended the assembly, which was a legally constituted formal assembly. The assembly passed (1) not expressing an attitude on President Zhang's resignation; (2) four criteria for the new president: (A) Someone who is respected by the public for their academic and moral standing and has no bureaucratic habits; (B) someone who can focus on their duties and has the determination and ability to develop National Central University; (C) someone who has achieved success in running higher education; (D) someone with a considerable history in the Party and the country. During the discussion of the fourth proposal, attendees withdrew one after another, because the nature of the proposal was insinuating and seemed to have another purpose, and the few speakers were strong-willed and eloquent, with ulterior motives. Subsequently, students successively discovered the "quorum" issue (only about two hundred people at this time). In accordance with Section 23 of Sun Yat-sen's Preliminary Principles of Democracy, the chairman (Liu Shichao) was asked to stop the discussion and declare the meeting adjourned. However, Liu Shichao was not familiar with the Preliminary Principles of Democracy and intended to manipulate the meeting, so he ignored the request and continued the discussion. Therefore, those who accused the chairman of being昏庸 continued to withdraw one after another. Afterward, there were only fifty or sixty people in attendance. In order to promote Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the union should deny the illegal proposals (from the fourth proposal onwards) after the general assembly found a lack of quorum. On the one hand, we request the Party Headquarters to stop Liu Shichao and others from implementing the unworkable and unfounded proposals from the fourth proposal onwards in order to demonstrate justice. As for the proposals before the third proposal, they have been resolved by the public opinion of our majority of students. The union sincerely accepts and has executed them to comfort the expectations of our students and lay the foundation for the new life of the school. There is also something that must be declared: The union did not hold a re-election because the representative council secretary, Ti Dong, did not follow the charter. The union repeatedly urged the secretariat, but the secretariat made excuses and delayed again and again. The intentions are obvious, and the responsibility lies there. The union is entrusted by all students and only knows how to act according to the will of all students. Success or failure, profit or loss, we do not know the work. If it benefits all students or is the will of all students, we will not hesitate to go through fire and water. Conversely, anything that harms the students or is not the will of the majority of students will be treated with hatred. Wherever justice lies, reason has no regrets.</p>
<p>Respectfully announced, hoping for your clear understanding. November 8th.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office Describes the Education Funding Situation <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<h3 id="e121">To the Jiangsu Education Funding Committee <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office sent a letter to the Jiangsu Education Funding Committee, stating that the office had previously received a letter from principals of provincial middle and primary schools, including Zhang Tong, severely questioning the arrears in various expenses. It has sent a detailed reply clarifying the methods of raising and distributing funds for July and August and the extreme difficulties of the education funding situation, and requested the prompt dispatch of an accountant to audit the office. These exchanges of official letters have been published in the education columns of various newspapers on November 3rd. It is assumed that everyone has read them and is aware of the outline. Recently, the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Provincial Schools issued a serious declaration with phrases such as "Education funds are by no means exhausted" and "Who are you trying to deceive with false claims of shortages?"</p>
<p>The source of education special funds is limited to the slaughter tax and tooth tax and busy canal special funds. There are no newly opened tax sources, but expenditures have been expanding year by year. The budget lists a subsidy of 500,000 from the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Finance. On the surface, it appears that revenue and expenditure are in balance, but in reality, there are inevitable situations of虚收实支. It is already insufficient to cover expenses. In addition, due to natural disasters and banditry in previous years, tax revenues have sharply decreased, making it impossible to cope with the situation. The detailed situation has been disclosed in the reply to the Education Department and does not need to be repeated.</p>
<p>As for the claim that the salaries of the office staff are paid every half month, it is not known that payment requires a notification form to be audited by the Audit Committee. If payments are made twice a month, it is inconsistent with the methods of various schools. How could the Audit Committee approve such absurd claims? This is not worth a knowing person's smile. However, it is said that there are layers of obscurity in the office, and the economy has not been made public. If we remain silent, outsiders who do not know the content may inevitably be doubtful. Therefore, it is necessary to defend ourselves. Since the independence of education funds in March of the 14th year, there has been concern that there may be abuses in the income. Therefore, the Education Gold Treasury of the China Communications Jiangsu Three Banks was established. All counties remit funds directly to the Education Gold Treasury, which issues formal and deputy treasury receipts. The treasury receipt is stored by the fund-remitting agency. The formal treasury receipt is sent to the Management Office for inspection, clarification, and registration. The Management Office never directly receives cash. No agency directly delivers cash to the Management Office. This is how the income is handled.</p>
<p>Again, fearing that the expenditure is not verified, the Audit Committee was organized. The committee meets twice a month to audit the accounts. All payments are made only after a notification form is filled out, reviewed, approved, and stamped by the Audit Committee, and then stamped by the Education Department and the Director of the Management Office. The fund-receiving agency then goes to the Gold Treasury to collect the funds. They cannot make payments on their own, and they cannot withdraw funds independently. This is how the expenditure is handled.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the power of income is controlled by the Education Gold Treasury, and the power of expenditure is controlled by the Audit Committee. The Management Office is only in a management position. Where do the obscurities come from? Even in the case of the slaughter tax, which is most competitive, the Management Office adheres to its principles, firmly adheres to the established regulations, and treats all committee-recognized merchants with equal standards, regardless of the amount offered, and requires all to pay 20% deposit in advance. There is no room for flexibility and no obscurities. Furthermore, at the end of each month, the income and expenditure are compiled into a report and printed and sent to all schools and agencies for public inspection. How is it that these faculty and staff have never seen it? Why do they say that the economy has not been made public? This is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Currently, the funds for July and August are being raised, either by borrowing busy canal funds from various counties or by borrowing cash from banks. The slaughter tax deposit should be refunded when the merchants' recognition period expires. Reluctantly, all funds are being transferred and used as資. It is already竭泽而渔. Even so, the principals and faculty of various schools still suspect that the funds will not be issued and falsely accuse us of obscurities. We should ask the esteemed committee to borrow from the Education Department for verification of the previous letter and promptly send an accountant to the office to audit the accounts to dispel suspicions and clarify the truth. However, various schools need funds every month, and the treasury is empty. The busy canal tax has not yet been征. In this difficult time, we are at a loss. The esteemed committee is responsible for the overall planning of education funds for the entire province. At this critical juncture, when bankruptcy is imminent, please promptly convene a meeting to discuss rescue methods and agree on opening up new taxes so that the office can follow and the various schools can rely on to maintain themselves. We await your orders with great anticipation.</p>
<p>There is also something more to ask. Apart from the slaughter tax, which is managed by the committee or recognized merchants, and the Management Office has full power to rectify, the remaining tooth tax and busy canal special funds are managed by the finance bureaus or magistrates of various counties, who can arbitrarily transfer funds. The Management Office has no power to remove them and has repeatedly urged them, but they disregard us. The misuse of busy canal funds, which are levied as an attachment, is even more serious. Previously, the 21st meeting of the esteemed committee resolved to ask the Education Department to consult with the Provincial Government and the Finance Department to order the finance bureaus of various counties that no matter what expenses are related to education funds, they are not allowed to be transferred, and the busy canal funds should be divided. With this proposal, we thought we could proceed accordingly, but the finance bureaus of various counties nominally divided the busy canal funds but still misused them. Despite the serious negotiations by the supervisors, many were still outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant and unwilling to earnestly implement the division and store the funds in banks. In such a situation, even the original education special funds will be greatly affected. We also hope that the esteemed committee will review the previous case and again ask the Provincial Government and the Finance Department to strictly order the finance bureaus of various counties to earnestly implement the division and separate storage of the busy canal funds and not transfer or default in any way. Any non-compliant officers should be dismissed and ordered to clear the funds and return them. This will be enough to demonstrate deterrence. We still hope for a reply. This is addressed to the Jiangsu Education Funding Committee.</p>

<p>In addition to posting slogans and printing leaflets, the promotion department is compiling a chronological table of Sun Yat-sen's life, printing delicate cards, and distributing them to the public. The content begins with Sun Yat-sen's birth on November 12th of the 5th year of the Tongzhi reign in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County, Guangdong Province, and describes his brief history year by year until his death on March 12th of the 14th year of the Republic of China.

Inside the building, the exhibition department and the citizen's library are planning a memorial room. Photographs of Sun Yat-sen's life and his involvement in the revolutionary movement, as well as his lifelong works, are being collected and displayed in two rooms: (1) the Party Ideology Department of the Citizen Education Exhibition Room; (2) the Library Reading Room. It is currently being prepared and decorated. Anyone who wishes to commemorate Sun Yat-sen's great history and fully understand the meaning of the Kuomintang can go there for reference.</p>

<p>Recounts his ordeal</p>
<p>Cheng Shih-kuei, member of the Fujian Provincial Government and concurrently Minister of Education of the province, was detained in Youxi along with Lin Chih-yuan and others in January of this year for challenging Lu Hsing-pang over the province's education budget. Except for Chen Nai-yuan, who died, the other five provincial officials were fortunately spared. It was only recently that the reporter learned that Mr. Cheng and the others arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Mr. Cheng and learned the full details as follows: Soon after being detained, Mr. Cheng and the others were taken to the Youxi Command Headquarters, where the three officials lived together in a small room. All meals and daily life took place there. Normally, they were only allowed to read leisure books, and all newspapers were forbidden. All correspondence had to be collected and forwarded by Secretary Wang, but whether or not the contents were delivered depended entirely on the whims of the guards. During the detention, they were repeatedly on the verge of death, but the officials had long put their lives aside. Now, they were fortunate to regain their freedom, like a second life. After being released, they attended a welcome rally held by local people in Fujian, and then, together with Chairman Yang Shu-chuang, Lin Sen, Hsu Hsien-shih, Cheng Pao-ch'ing, and Wu Shu, they took the Yongjian warship to Shanghai. They arrived at Wusong at eleven o'clock the night before last and arrived here yesterday morning. Mr. Cheng is currently residing at No. 85 Jingxiu Road, Ximen. It is said that he intends to rest for a while before going to Nanjing to report everything. It is also said that Mr. Cheng wrote two volumes of diary during his detention, which may be printed into a booklet in the future to leave a trace.</p>
<p>Yu Yu-jen Resolves to Take Office as President of China National University</p>
<h3 id="e128">Expression to Tsai Yuan-pei and Students <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency) The issue of the presidency of China National University in Wusong has attracted much attention in society. After the school board approved Ma Chun-wu's resignation and appointed Yu Yu-jen as his successor, most students were eager for Mr. Yu to take office as soon as possible. However, because Mr. Yu was slow to respond, the welcoming atmosphere seemed superficially quiet. A small number of students took the opportunity to campaign for Mr. Ma to return. At this time of transition, the school has fallen into a state of anarchy. It is now learned that Mr. Yu has decided to comply with the wishes of the school board and succeed as president. Recently, the student body has organized a student association to resolve the student unrest and issued a declaration requesting the school board to promptly implement the resolution and urge the successor to take charge of the school. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tsai Yuan-pei Urges Mr. Yu to Take Office On the third of this month, Tsai Yuan-pei personally went to urge Mr. Yu to take office as soon as possible. Mr. Yu said that he originally did not intend to interfere, but seeing the complex situation within the school in recent days, he would not decline the position. However, the date of taking office has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Yu Yu-jen Expresses Responsibility On the evening of the fifth of this month, because the school was in a state of panic and urgently needed a new president to take office, the students separately sent eight representatives to visit Mr. Yu at his private residence to urge him to take office as soon as possible to appease the public and to inquire about the exact date of taking office so that a grand welcome ceremony could be held. Mr. Yu earnestly expressed to the representatives that he was a founder of China National University and, although he had been somewhat estranged from the school's situation, he had always been very concerned. This time, the school board asked him to be the president. He originally declined due to his declining strength, but the school board has already expressed its intentions and the situation within the school is becoming increasingly complex. If this delay continues, it would harm the school's future and the students' studies. He would take full responsibility for the party and the school to satisfy them. Mr. Ma would definitely not return to be the president. Currently, everything needs to be prepared, and there will be a satisfactory statement soon. It is late, and Wusong is far away. They can go back to school with peace of mind. He would not disappoint them. It is now heard that the students are actively preparing for a welcome ceremony, and it is said that Mr. Yu will take office before attending the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee.</p>
<p>Nine Organizations Hold Joint Meeting The student associations of China National University from Sichuan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Wujin, and the pre-second grade association, and other nine organizations held a joint meeting the day before yesterday afternoon and resolved the following important matters: (1) Organize the China National University Student Alliance to Resolve the Student Unrest; (2) Send representatives to visit Chairman Tsai to report on the actual situation within the school and expose the inside story of the illegal delegation; (3) Request the school board to promptly implement the resolution; (4) Issue a declaration to the outside world; (5) Issue a notice internally. It is also heard that the representatives sent by the joint association went to contact various parties yesterday.</p>
<p>Students Host Press The entire student delegation hosted reporters from major newspapers and news agencies in Shanghai at the Atlantic Hotel at 8 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 6th). First, Pang Mengfei, a representative of the delegation, detailed the remote causes and effects of the unrest, and then expressed that the will of more than a thousand students would not stop until the goal of retaining Ma was achieved.</p>

<p>The details of the student unrest at Nanyang Medical College in this city, which led to the expulsion of the president, have been reported in various newspapers.

<p>Only Three New Records Were Created Due to the Absence of First-Class Athletes</p>
<p>Masaru Hisatomi (Men's 800m), Tatsuo Saitsu (Decathlon)</p>
<p>Sadako Yamamoto (Women's 800m)</p>
<p>October 27, Osaka Dispatch The 17th National Games, organized by the Japan Association of Athletics Federations, was held at the Osaka Municipal Stadium on the 25th and 26th of this month. On the first day, due to the rain, the records of each event were not very special. On the second day, the weather finally recovered, and the athletes showed their skills and created three new records. One was Masaru Hisatomi's 800m, Tatsuo Saitsu's decathlon, and Sadako Yamamoto's women's 800m, all of which broke Japan's recognized records. Before the meeting, according to general predictions, at least seven or eight new records would be created this time. However, because Japan's first-class athletes did not participate, there was less excitement. For example, Kimura, who holds the high jump record, Nishida, who is second in the world in the pole vault, Oda, who won the world triple jump championship, Kudo, who runs the 10,000m, and Yoshioka and Nakajima, who run short distances, all announced their withdrawal because they wanted to give opportunities to newcomers. The audience on both days was very crowded. The records of men's and women's events, except for the 100m, were all very high. Compared with the results of our country's National Games, it is inevitable that they are far behind. The results of each event are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e144">Full Text of the Review Report of the Second Group <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Encourage Overseas Chinese to Ship Red and Green Tea Overseas</p>
<p>Discontinue Ordnance Factories and Remodel New-Style Agricultural Tools</p>
<p>Develop Export Industries in the Northeast</p>
<p>41. Concerning the proposal to request the establishment of overseas industry and commerce investigation offices (Tang Changfeng): This proposal provides very detailed planning for overseas industry and commerce investigation matters. It is proposed that the General Assembly approve it and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce adopt it.</p>
<p>42. Recommendation on maintaining egg trade with the United States (Tianjin Xinji Trading Company, etc.): The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has just recovered the inspection of foreign personnel handling inspections in China. If the proposed method is followed, it seems inappropriate. However, resolving foreign trade disputes is of great importance, and it is proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce promptly formulate other relief measures. 43. Proposal that state-owned railways promptly establish warehouse operations, vigorously implement responsible cargo transportation, and issue custody receipts and shipping receipts to regulate the economy of merchants and the people (Ding Jingchen, Zhong Weichen): The matters raised in this proposal are all things that should be done. It is proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce consult the Ministry of Railways to adopt and implement them.</p>
<p>44. Because of the decline of Chinese tea and the hardship of the people's livelihood, it is proposed to persuade overseas Chinese to try to ship red and green tea overseas, promote domestic goods, and relieve the people's livelihood (Yu Duwei): The proposal advocates maintaining the tea industry and is consistent with the opinion of the eighth case in the previous review report of this group. It is proposed that they be merged and handled.</p>
<p>45. The government should give special encouragement and protection to foreign trade (</p>
<p>Lu Chengchang): The methods listed in this proposal are all appropriate. It is proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce adopt them.</p>
<p>46. Please implement an incentive policy to develop the export trade of the Northeast (Lu Guangji): This proposal involves the reduction of freight rates and tariffs, which concerns the Ministries of Finance and Railways. It is proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce forward it to the Ministries of Finance and Railways for consideration.</p>
<p>47. Establish a temporary specialized committee to investigate the main export goods of the country in order to increase production, improve quality, and develop foreign trade (</p>
<p>He Lian, Fang Xianting): This proposal advocates setting up a committee to investigate the main export products in order to develop foreign trade, which is of great importance. It is proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce adopt and implement it. 48. Establish overseas commercial counselors to promote international trade (He</p>
<p>Lian, Fang Xianting): This proposal is consistent with the first item of the first proposal. It is proposed that it be referred for joint study.)</p>
<p>49. Proposal to convert the discontinued ordnance factories and mints into industrial factories and give priority to manufacturing new-style agricultural tools (He Cen): This proposal proposes to convert the discontinued ordnance factories, mints, and other factories into industrial factories, which is a very good intention. It is proposed that it be passed and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce consult the competent authorities in each province to conduct thorough investigations and promote the conversion.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Each Proposal Passed Through Discussion <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>After the report, the chairman asked if there were any objections to the above nine proposals. If there were no objections, they would be considered passed. The entire assembly had no objections and decided to pass them.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Third Review Report of the Third Group Passed <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Next, the third review report of the third group was discussed, and Yan Zhuang reported as follows:</p>
<p>Case 34 (Qian Chengxu, etc.): The case is about the proposal to amend Article 18 of the Factory Law. After review, this case falls within the scope of legal interpretation and does not need to be submitted for amendment.</p>
<p>Case 35 (Wang Yunwu): The case is to request that all industries and factories be ordered to stipulate work standards in order to increase production and reduce labor-management disputes. After review, this case should be discussed together with Case 31 of this group.</p>
<p>Case 36 (Liu Kai): The case is about stipulating minimum wage measures. After review, the measures in this case should be revised as follows: "First, establish wage committees in industrially developed areas, organized by representatives from the government, labor, and management, to stipulate the minimum wage rates for each industry based on local living conditions and submit them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (or a separately organized central wage committee) for approval and implementation." And request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to handle the matter (passed).</p>
<p>Discussing Scientific Management</p>
<h3 id="e147">Principle Passed <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>In addition, there is the scientific management method proposal submitted by the Zhejiang Construction Department, which was reported by Wang Yunwu. This case was merged from the scientific management method cases and the industrial rationalization cases into this case. The third group designated Liu Hongsheng and himself to be responsible for reviewing it and submitted this case as follows:</p>
<p>Proposal to promote scientific management methods in order to achieve industrial rationalization</p>
<p>(Explanation) This case is based on the Proposal to Promote the Scientific Management of Industry submitted by the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, the Proposal to Promote Scientific Management Methods submitted by the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau, the Request to Implement Scientific Management Methods in National Industry and Commerce submitted by Chen Ting'an, the Proposal to Request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Order All Industries and Factories to Stipulate Work Standards to Increase Production and Reduce Labor-Management Disputes submitted by Wang Yunwu, the Proposal to Plan to Establish Industrial and Commercial Management Personnel Training Institutes submitted by Xu PeiHuang, and the Proposal to Establish a Central Industrial Rationalization Research Association and Establish Research Branches in Various Provinces and Cities submitted by the Zhejiang Construction Department. The Proposal to Promote Rationalization to Establish the Foundation of Industry and Commerce submitted by Mu Junde and the opinions of member Wang Yunwu were merged to form this case. (Reason) Scientific management methods are methods to promote production, eliminate consumption, and eliminate labor-management disputes. They originated in the United States and France and spread to countries around the world. Industrial rationalization (is a whole plan for the national economy, which originated in Germany and was decided by the International Economic Conference, hoping that countries around the world will adopt it together. The former is a means, the latter is a goal, the former has a narrower meaning and is suitable for an industry or an institution, the latter has a broader meaning and is suitable for an entire profession or the entire country. Although their sources and meanings are slightly different, they are no different in their suitability to the current needs of our country. Because our country's industry is fragile, and the number of people surpassing it each year is as high as tens of thousands of yuan. To resist foreign economic aggression, it is impossible to develop domestic industry without success. To develop industry and make the quality, quantity, and value of domestic products sufficient to compete with foreign goods, there is no other way than to strictly implement scientific management methods. Also, there are many labor-management disputes at present, which have caused the embryonic industry to be destroyed again. However, after studying the reasons, most of them are due to the inadequacy and unfairness of labor remuneration. Scientific management methods can obtain the maximum production with the minimum labor and the lowest</p>
<p>Consumption, the result is the possibility of making labor remuneration adequate. Scientific management methods stipulate work standards according to objective methods, and the result is the possibility of making labor remuneration fair. Therefore, scientific management methods are undoubtedly an essential plan for our country's industrial sector. As far as industrial rationalization is concerned, the current economic chaos in our country is no different from that of Germany after the war. Germany used industrial rationalization to make the national economy a whole plan to save the country's fortune. Therefore, our country also needs to learn from it. (Measures) (A) Regarding scientific management methods (1) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce should issue an order to the provincial and municipal governments to supervise industrial and commercial administrative</p>
<p>The organs convene industrial and commercial leaders to organize branches of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association to study the implementation plan of scientific management methods (2) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce should order all industries and factories to stipulate work standards within a possible scope and give bonuses to workers who exceed the standards on a regular basis (3) The National Industry and Commerce Conference should issue a declaration unanimously supporting the research and implementation of scientific management methods (B) Regarding industrial rationalization (1) The central government should set up a National Industrial Rationalization Research Association (2) The National Industrial Rationalization Research Association should aim to study the entire plan of the national economy (3) The National Industrial Rationalization Research Association should be organized by the following organs and groups (A) The central organs in charge of and related to industrial administrative affairs, such as the Construction Committee, the Ministry of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Mining, Communications, and Railways (B) Academic groups such as the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association, the China Science Society, the China Engineering Society, the China Economic Society, and the Chinese Agricultural Society (C) National vocational groups such as the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, etc. Those who have not organized a national association shall temporarily be replaced by vocational groups in important cities such as the Shanghai Bankers Association (D) Representatives of labor groups (4) The organs and groups in the preceding article shall separately appoint several representatives as basic members (5) The basic members shall elect several experts who do not belong to the organs and groups in Article 3 to form the National Industrial Rationalization Research Association Committee with the basic members (6) Several subcommittees shall be established</p>
<p>The personnel of the organs and groups in Article 3 shall organize them, but they do not belong to this</p>
<p>Personnel of item organs and groups may also join (7) The National Industrial Rationalization Research Association shall set up a fixed administrative department and a research department (8) The National Industrial Rationalization Research Association shall be allocated funds by the central government (9) The National Industrial Rationalization Research Association shall be designated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to appoint members and hire experts as preparatory members for preparation</p>
<h3 id="e148">Discussion Situation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>After Wang Yunwu's report, Bi Fangjiaobo said that Wang's report was detailed and the methods were very appropriate. He requested the chairman to put it to a vote. The chairman said that the above four proposals could be combined and put to a vote. Zheng Hongnian said that under the "various academic organizations" item in the third proposal, "various universities" should be added and not just individuals. The chairman said that scientific management should not waste time, energy, or materials; only when the above three points can be implemented does it conform to the principles of scientific management.</p>
<p>Yang Xifo said that regarding the organizations researching industrial rationalization, besides the various universities, there is also the Construction Committee, etc. However, the equipment, talent, etc., of research associations across the country may not be able to bear this significant responsibility. He proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce organize an industrial rationalization research association, using national financial resources to gather national talent to conduct research. Wang Yunwu explained that the seventh proposal called for a fixed secretariat and research department to be established in the rationalization research association to be responsible for research, and that it did not include convening all national talent, as that would be difficult to achieve in practice.</p>
<p>Zhu Maocheng said that the situations of industrial rationalization research associations vary in different countries, and their purpose is to invent new methods of rationalization. China's industrial rationalization research association is indeed urgently needed at present.</p>
<p>Shi Ying advocated soliciting research from domestic organizations and individuals separately, so he proposed that the principle of this proposal be passed first, and then the implementation methods be reviewed and handled by the Ministry of Industry. A representative from Zhejiang Province said that the purpose of proposing this proposal should be to request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to establish a research association to collect specialized talent to engage in research and publish the research results to the industrial and commercial sectors for them to learn from. Therefore, the importance of this proposal is not something that empty academic research organizations can fulfill. A member proposed to stop the discussion and put it to a vote.</p>
<p>The chairman announced the end of the discussion. The principle of this proposal was passed, and the detailed methods were handed over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review and handling. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Condolences to Chairman Chiang</p>
<h3 id="e149">Approved Telegram Text <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Next, Hu Shuhua read the telegram from the conference to General Commander Chiang. Zhu Maocheng suggested not adding the "building a memorial tower" clause and instead using the funds to build other construction projects. The chairman said that the memorial methods had already been passed yesterday and should not be changed, but the funds for building the memorial tower should be shared by the attending members. The entire assembly had no objection to the draft telegram, which was passed as follows:</p>
<p>Most Urgent to Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Fenghua, and please forward to all armed comrades at the front: The recent Yan-Feng Rebellion has caused turmoil throughout the country. Fortunately, Your Excellency has upheld the late Premier's teachings with a spirit of fearlessness, leading armed comrades to serve the country, thereby quelling the rebellion, removing obstacles, and allowing our industrial and commercial circles to see the light of day again. Gathered in the capital under a unified and consolidated government, we can calmly discuss all construction issues. In terms of the Party and the Nation, this is regarded as a harbinger of better times after adversity. From the industrial and commercial standpoint, it is especially recognized as a new opportunity for survival and revival. The conference proposes to support the Central Government in quelling the rebellion, consolidating peace and unity, and protecting industry and commerce to develop the economy. Please circulate this telegram throughout the country to clarify the justice of right and wrong and to offer condolences to General Commander Chiang and the armed comrades at the front. The proposal lists three measures: (1) This conference will send telegrams to General Commander Chiang and the armed comrades at the front to offer condolences and circulate a telegram throughout the country to analyze the right and wrong, and to establish national policy. (2) This conference will raise funds to build a memorial tower in the capital to commemorate the quelling of this rebellion. (3) The chairman of this conference will lead the entire body in standing in silence for three minutes to express mourning for the soldiers who died in the front lines. The entire assembly unanimously passed the resolution to stabilize the situation and support the endangered, deeply moved by the virtue of your arrival. We pledge to exert our utmost efforts to support you with sincerity. This telegram is respectfully submitted for your consideration. Sincerely, all members of the National Industrial and Commercial Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Second Report of the Fourth Group <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The commercial tax section of the fourth group has been handed over with fifteen draft proposals for the second time, and seven draft proposals transferred from other groups. After review, opinions are as follows: Case No. 64: The Ministry of Railways should abolish railway freight donations and various miscellaneous donations. (Review Opinion) Railway freight donations and various miscellaneous donations are similar to transit taxes and should be abolished. The National Government has already issued a clear order to implement this on a fixed schedule, and it should be included in the abolition of transit tax cases.</p>
<p>Case No. 68: Wang Jiean of Yaoming Mast Light Factory requests tax exemption to receive equal treatment with Daming Company. (Review Opinion) Whether to exempt taxes on imitation foreign goods should be treated the same across the board. It should be resolved by the meeting and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for review and handling.</p>
<p>Case No. 69: Hui Shu Kong's additional tax is too high. Please thoroughly cancel it to level the appraisal. (Review Opinion) This additional salt tax hinders sales and should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for verification and handling.</p>
<p>Case No. 74: Tianjin Social Bureau requests a special import tax on cotton yarn to subsidize commercial cotton yarn factories. (Review Opinion) Whether the special tax on cotton yarn is uniform for both Chinese and foreign cotton yarn, or only levied on imported cotton yarn, is currently unknown. If it is uniform for both Chinese and foreign cotton yarn, then the subsidy method mentioned in the original proposal may be difficult to implement. It should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for consideration.</p>
<p>Case No. 76: Tianjin Social Bureau pre-collects public welfare donations from merchants when purchasing local goods. (Review Opinion) The so-called public welfare donation seems to be establishing a separate item in addition to the regular tax. Once this precedent is set, various exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes will inevitably be retained under various pretexts, and goods will still inevitably suffer heavy levies. This proposal should be rejected by the conference.</p>
<p>Case No. 80: Deng Yanhua requests that foreign machinery that cannot be manufactured domestically be exempted from taxes or reduced to the minimum to reduce the cost of manufactured goods. (Review Opinion) The domestic machinery industry is still in its infancy, and the tax rates should be reduced to develop industries. It should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for appropriate reduction when revising import tariffs.</p>
<p>Case No. 81: Beijing General Chamber of Commerce requests the abolition of the Chongwenmen tax. (Review Opinion) The Chong Customs has already been resolved by the Executive Yuan to be abolished, so the conference does not need to discuss it.</p>
<p>Case No. 82: Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce requests the abolition of freight donations along the Ping-Sui Railway. (Review Opinion) The same as Case No. 64, it should be resolved by the conference and included in the abolition of transit tax cases.</p>
<p>Case No. 83: Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce requests a reduction or exemption of the excessive porcelain tax. (Review Opinion) The Hebei transit tax mentioned in the original proposal should be included in the abolition of transit tax cases. As for the excessively high Jiangxi special tax rate, it should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for appropriate reduction.</p>
<p>Case No. 84: Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce requests that the Hebei Province unified tax is too high, please restore the old 1.25 system. (Review Opinion) After the implementation of the abolition of transit taxes, all Hebei Province unified taxes are being separately reorganized and abolished. At present, the province's unified tax is too high and repeatedly levied, and it should be resolved by the meeting and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities to quickly reduce or exempt it.</p>
<p>Case No. 86: Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce: The cessation of redemption of Zhili Provincial Bank banknotes is detrimental to merchants and residents. It is proposed to consult and transfer to the Hebei Provincial Government to maintain the original agreement to use reed salt production donations for reorganization. (Review Opinion) The reed salt production donation was originally designated specifically for the Zhili Provincial Bank's cash redemption, which concerns financial credit and cannot be ignored. It should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to earnestly consult the Hebei Provincial Government to handle it according to the old plan, and not to divert it for other purposes to alleviate merchants' difficulties.</p>
<p>Case No. 87: Beijing Shuanghesheng requests that all foreign wines in concessions be uniformly affixed with stamps. (Review Opinion) The original proposal states that the stamp tax burden on foreign wines in concessions and domestically produced imitation wines is uneven, which is indeed the case. It should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities to handle it to ensure that the burden is equal.</p>
<p>Case No. 88: Hangzhou National Goods Factory Joint Association requests exemption from national goods advertising donations. (Review Opinion) Advertising is indeed an exorbitant tax and miscellaneous tax that hinders the promotion of merchants' goods. Please resolve by the conference and consult with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for exemption. In addition, if other provinces have such exorbitant donations, they should be handled uniformly.</p>
<p>Case No. 89: Shanghai Cosmetics Trade Association requests an increase in import finished goods tax and exemption of raw material tax. (Review Opinion) The necessary foreign raw materials should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to verify that they are raw materials that cannot be produced domestically, compiled into a case, and reduced or exempted. The import tax should be discussed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce with the competent authorities when revising the tax rules.</p>
<p>Case No. 90: Li Zuban, etc., proposes measures to address customs discrimination against national goods. Check the original case regarding foreign goods…after paying the full tax once…national goods…after paying the full tax one and a half times…If the abolition of transit tax is implemented, then the export tax from this port to that port and the re-import half tax should all be… included in the abolition of transit tax cases and should be handled accordingly. Before the abolition of transit tax is implemented, please resolve by the conference and request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities to first exempt the re-import half tax. As for the unequal treatment of Chinese and foreign goods mentioned in Items B, C, and D, please resolve by the conference and request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities and thoroughly investigate and revise them.</p>
<p>Proposal moved by the first group to earnestly implement the exchange law, strictly protect exchange tax revenue, and revise the exchange tax rate, that is, to use the increased tax revenue to handle basic cases. (Review Opinion) The original proposal still lists various methods, the main purpose of which is (1) to dispatch supervisors to crack down on improper profits of brokers and protect exchange revenue; (2) to revise the tax regulations of the exchange, not based on net profit but on total revenue calculated by total assets; and (3) to store the increased revenue in a special fund to establish industries. The exchange tax is still a legitimate source of tax revenue, and revitalizing industry is an urgent task at present. The methods listed in the original proposal seem feasible, and it is proposed to resolve by the conference and request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult with the competent authorities for review and implementation.</p>
<p>Case No. 20 moved by the fifth group proposes to clearly define firecrackers as not being superstitious items and to reduce the tax on their manufacturing raw materials. (Review Opinion) The proposed reduction in the tax on manufacturing firecracker raw materials refers to the currently levied saltpeter and sulfur tax in Guangdong Province. It should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for review and handling.</p>
<p>Case No. 8 moved by the sixth group is the Industry Relief Case. The original proposal concerning this group has two points: (1) Exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes should be eliminated; (2) Financial undertakings should be maintained. (Review Opinion) The first point should be included in the transit tax abolition case. The second point advocates that old public bonds should be reorganized and that internal debts that do not benefit production should not be issued in the future, which are insightful. It should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities to pay attention.</p>
<p>Case No. 9 moved by the sixth group proposes that the most important cases for industrial relief should first start with manual labor in silk reeling, cotton weaving, and silk weaving, and has drafted two methods for emergency relief and long-term solutions. (Review Opinion) Silk fabrics are heavily taxed with cocoon tax, silk tax, silk fabric tax, and product donations, which are truly the reasons for the decline of silk fabrics. For the various proposed methods, the tariff and commercial tax parts should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities to provide assistance. As for the terms and interest funds of the National Goods Bank loans, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should determine the methods.</p>
<p>Case No. 11 moved by the sixth group is the urgent matter of commercial relief. The original proposal concerning this group has two points: (1) Public bond interest should not be too high, and tariffs should adopt protectionism. (Review Opinion) Both of the above points are insightful and should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for appropriate handling.</p>
<p>Case No. 14 moved by the sixth group is the Industry Relief Case. (Review Opinion) The original proposal to reduce the tax rate on domestic cotton, cotton cloth, and foreign cotton so that daily necessities are not expensive is beneficial to people's livelihood and should be resolved by the conference and requested by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the competent authorities for handling.</p>
<p>Case No. 21 moved by the sixth group is the relief of major industries such as silk, matches, flour, cigarettes, and silk weaving, which is divided into three items: (A) issuing relief public bonds, (B) reducing various tax rates, and (C) reducing transportation costs.</p>
<p>(Review Opinion) It should be resolved (A) by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who should investigate and devise methods to implement it; (B) and (C) by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who should consult the competent authorities for handling.</p>
<p>The Financial Affairs Section of the Fourth Group's Proposal on Industrial and Commercial Banks The original proposal was not received by August 20th, 1922. The case was re-submitted for review and reported that financial industries and industrial and commercial industries are interdependent. To develop industrial and commercial industries, it is impossible to succeed without establishing large-scale financial institutions. Therefore, the establishment of industrial and commercial banks is the current urgent need. The above-mentioned cases for establishing industrial and commercial banks list specific methods. It should be requested that the majority of the departments work together with the Ministry of Finance to adopt and implement them. However, before it is held, it should still be requested that the majority of the departments transfer the consulting to the Ministry of Finance, instructing the National Goods Bank and various banks to fully assist and organize warehouses to promote mortgage business, and order the banks to strictly prohibit speculation.</p>
<p>The Passage of Various Cases</p>
<h3 id="e151">Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau Should Exempt National Goods Advertising Tax <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Dian finished the report and put it to discussion.</p>
<p>Zhang Zilian said that although the national goods advertising tax has already been submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Executive Yuan to order the national tax exemption, the Shanghai Finance Bureau does not comply. Please ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to reissue an order for compliance. Also, regarding Case No. 80, reducing taxes on machinery that cannot be manufactured domestically will hinder the progress of imitation and should increase its tax.</p>
<p>The chairman said that this point can be submitted to the Tariff Committee for reference and attention. The chairman put the entire review report of the fourth group to a vote, and the majority passed it.</p>
<p>(Unnumbered) Regulations on rewarding domestic products</p>
<p>"Resolution": "Item 1" please the Ministry of Industry and Commerce handle as appropriate. "Items 2 and 3" handle according to the Special Industry Encouragement Law. "Item 4" please the Ministry of Industry and Commerce consult with the Ministry of Finance to handle the supplementary explanation "Proposal to establish a production craft guidance institution" (Chu Xiaoshi Huang Gong Huaiying) (Method) The central government establishes a production craft guidance bureau under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Each province and city establishes a production craft guidance institute under the Department of Industry and Commerce, specializing in its affairs. (Organization) Divided into two departments: administrative and technical. The administrative aspect is divided into three sections: farmers' sideline craft section, pending craft section, and modern craft section. The technical aspect is staffed by people proficient in mechanical chemistry and art specialized craft talents and assisted by talents with special skills. As for the guiding steps, first start with farmers' existing handicrafts (such as textiles, cotton cloth, thread, rattan ropes, umbrellas, straw sandals, etc.), old-style inherent factories (such as porcelain, pottery, lacquerware, cloisonné, etc.), and new craft rudimentary factories (such as toys, stationery, printed silk cloth, clocks, etc.). Manual guidance and training will allow them to profit, and the general public will naturally imitate them, and then gradually expand the scope so that all production crafts can be established in sequence. Supplementary explanation Please the Ministry of Industry and Commerce consult the Ministry of Education or have industrial and commercial institutions raise funds to establish a craft vocational school (Chu Xiaoshi Huang Huaiying)</p>
<p>(Method) First establish craft vocational schools in the two education centers of Beijing and Ping, and attach practice factories and reference books that must be prepared first. Establish research departments within the school to train creative and inventive talents, and attach Class A schools and supplementary schools to popularize craft education and train talents at all levels. The subjects are temporarily divided into pottery, dyeing, printing, metalworking, woodwork, lacquer, precision machinery, patterns, etc. The above departments are currently lacking in industrial schools across the country, and these crafts are used daily and foreign goods are increasing. If measures are not taken to remedy this situation as soon as possible, there will be no day to maintain domestic goods and recover rights. (All of the above industries were resolved and passed)</p>
<p>Discuss opposing the establishment of separate customs laws</p>
<p>Zhou Dian reported that the review committee received a telegram from the Guangzhou Provincial Wuzhou Chamber of Commerce yesterday opposing the establishment of separate customs laws.</p>
<p>Resolution: The telegram will be handed over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for deliberation and handling</p>
<h3 id="e152">Passed the Fourth Group's Financial and Commercial Tax Proposal <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Checked that the second handover for review totaled twenty-seven proposals, and the group resolution was still divided into financial and commercial tax sections for discussion. In addition to the report on commercial tax matters in another case, there were a total of eleven cases related to finance. The ones with the same nature as the previous report were reviewed together, and the remaining cases were reviewed separately. The various opinions are reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the reorganization of subsidiary coins (1) Case No. 79 (proposed by Xie Zhongfu) As copper coins flood the market, affecting commerce and hindering people's livelihood, the government should issue a notice to all provinces to temporarily suspend minting uniformly and prohibit the import of copper to maintain the status quo. (2) Case No. 85 (proposed by the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce) The national subsidiary coins are chaotic. It is proposed to quickly order a subsidiary coin system to maintain legal currency. It is necessary to rectify the subsidiary coins proposed in the above-mentioned cases. From the late Qing Dynasty to the present, there has been indiscriminate issuance and unrestricted issuance, and the people have suffered unspeakable pain. The majority of the departments should be consulted with the Ministry of Finance to speed up the reorganization to relieve the people's distress. (2) Regarding the savings promotion proposal Case No. 65 (proposed by Mou Junde) The savings promotion creates a capital case. The methods set out in the case (1) Supervising the savings institutions to preserve the security of the funds is important, but the Ministry of Finance has already set a method and will be announced soon (2) There is no doubt that lottery savings should be banned. The group will submit the case of banning the International Savings Association extracted by the Yunnan Construction Department to the conference for unanimous approval and implementation. (3) (4) The two items are related to the lives of workers and partners and should be promoted with all efforts.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Silver Syndicate original book Case No. 78 (proposed by Liu Kuida) The principle case of concentrating funds to organize the Silver Syndicate. There is no need to repeat that finance is the pivot of industry and commerce, and the concentration of capital and the consolidation of finance are the trends of modern times. The main idea of the case is to be more necessary for official-business cooperation in practice, but if the facilities are correct, not only can the industry's profits and losses be adjusted, but the country's finance can also be stabilized. Please urge the majority of financial institutions to recognize the principles of the case so that various industries can rely on it.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the proposal to establish an industrial and commercial bank (1) Case No. 66 (proposed by Yang Zaizhe) It is appropriate to quickly establish a large-scale industrial and commercial bank managed by the state to support domestic industry and commerce. (2) Case No. 67 (proposed by the Henan Construction Department) Provinces urgently need to prepare to establish industrial banks to promote industrial development. (3) Case No. 73 (proposed by Li Kui) Establish an industrial and commercial bank to concentrate national capital and use foreign capital to run industries and develop industry and commerce. (4) Case No. 70 (proposed by Liu Bingyi Zhou Xingtang) Organize state-run insurance to promote compulsory savings, implement centralized finance to regulate unemployment and seek economic development. (5) Case No. 71 (proposed by Liu Bingyi Zhou Xingtang) It is proposed that the government establish an enterprise bank to promote industry. Most of the cases have specific methods, but the implementation takes time. Before it is held, the majority of departments should be requested to instruct the National Goods and Communications Banks to do their best to support and promote industry and commerce to facilitate the process. As for the use of foreign capital under the principle of equality, it was mentioned in the eighth item of the first review report on fundraising and industry. (5) Regarding the Central Bank proposal Case No. 77 (proposed by Shui Zi Niu Zaikun) Please promote state-run financial undertakings in Gansu, Ning, and Qing provinces to develop Northwest industry and commerce. The case should be merged into the fourth item of the first review report, which is similar to the Central Bank proposal. To develop Northwest industry and commerce, the majority of the departments should check the proposal and consult the Ministry of Finance as soon as possible with the local authorities to start the work to develop.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the reorganization of industrial and commercial finance proposal Case No. 75 (proposed by Chen Duan) proposes to prepare for the establishment of a bill market to promote the credit system to circulate gold (finance development industry and commerce. The nature of the case is the same as the sixth item of the first report regarding the company securities and commercial paper proposals. Please ask the majority of departments to order the Banking Association and Exchange Federation to jointly study and commission methods for review and taking to facilitate implementation. The opinions of the colleagues in the group on the above review cases are briefly described on the right. Now specially submitted to the conference for discussion and should be resolved by public resolution and passed by a majority vote.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Adoption of the Motion to Establish a Rayon Factory <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The next discussion involved the Fifth Group's Cases 62 and 57 regarding the motion to establish a rayon factory, which was unanimously approved. The report is as follows: Upon investigation, the import of rayon has been extremely large recently, truly a major loss. People covet its smoothness and low price, and society has widely adopted it. Even natural silk fabrics cannot increase their price and benefit sales without being mixed with rayon. The people of the country are drinking poison to quench their thirst, which is undeniable. However, prohibiting imports is impossible. It is better to rise up and start manufacturing it ourselves in order to resist. It can be seen that those who proposed this motion have deep concern. However, the domestic silk industry is currently in a disastrous state. Now, advocating rayon seems like kicking our domestic natural silk when it is down. In fact, this is not the case. Because Chinese silk fabrics in today's society cannot survive without being mixed with rayon. We only need to make efforts to maintain and improve natural silk, making its quality and patterns increasingly exquisite. Then, there will be no time to export it in the future, so why worry about the status of our own country? Japan widely uses rayon, and at the same time, its natural silk still has made considerable progress. Now, it has defeated Chinese silk and holds the world's dominance, which can be further proof. Therefore, when reviewing this case,</p>
<p>Things can be changed to manufacture other types of medicines for military needs.</p>

<p>Discussion of temporary motions</p>
<h3 id="e161">Five Motions Adopted <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Deliberating on Resolving the Current Difficulties of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Authorities to Return Detained Vehicles and Not Detain Them Again</p>
<p>(1) The motion proposing the organization of an industry and commerce conference resolution promotion committee and the selection of a date for the general industry and commerce conference to realize cooperation between officials and the people and promote national production (Movers: Wu Yunqi, et al.) "Review Result": The proposal to organize an industry and commerce conference resolution promotion committee is feasible. As for whether a general meeting should be convened once a year, it should be discussed and decided by the general meeting.</p>
<p>During the general meeting discussion, some believed that the number of resolutions of this conference was extremely large, and whether they could be implemented simultaneously due to economic and other factors needed to be considered. Ma Chaojun argued that the method of supervision should be that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should submit a report on the implementation of the previous resolutions at the next industry and commerce conference to show the achievements. Others argued that this motion should not be established, but a friendly, strong association could be established after the meeting to jointly promote industrial and commercial undertakings. (This motion was not adopted.)</p>
<p>(2) The motion requesting the government to issue a clear order promulgating a policy to protect industry and commerce to be announced nationwide. It is believed that this industry and commerce conference is taking place at a time when unification has been completed and construction is in full swing. Industrial and commercial circles from all over the country were summoned to Beijing. At the beginning of the general meeting's opening, they respectfully read the instructions of Chairman Chiang of the National Government, announcing industrial and commercial viewpoints. Negatively, obstacles are removed; positively, incentives and promotions are emphasized. It is especially hoped that industrial and commercial circles will strive to help each other, and officials and the people will cooperate unanimously. At the same time, they respectfully listened to the opening speech of Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the major aspects of protecting industry and commerce and promoting people's livelihood. The plans were thorough, and the framework was clear. It is evident that our government has sincere intentions of nurturing and protecting industrial and commercial undertakings, and all gentlemen from all over the country have spared no effort to travel to the capital, expressing their candid views and jointly seeking construction. This is also sufficient to demonstrate the people's eager desire for governance. However, industrial and commercial undertakings are extremely complex. They rely on the government's maintenance and protection in various aspects, and they also rely on the unanimous efforts of the people of the country. At this time of military pacification and everything waiting to be rebuilt, promoting the development of industry and commerce, establishing an economic foundation, and consolidating peaceful unification are indeed urgent and cannot be delayed. The government's viewpoint of maintaining industrial and commercial undertakings is not only admired by the participating colleagues, but also the compass for industrial and commercial undertakings throughout the country. If the government can issue a clear order promulgating a policy to protect industry and commerce to be announced nationwide, the effectiveness of promoting the future development of industry and commerce will be even greater. Is it appropriate? Please wait for public decision. (Adopted)</p>

<p>(4) Please request the government to organize, adjust, and subsidize existing Chinese labor investigation and statistical organizations and encourage future work on the above items (Mover: Chen Zongcheng).</p>

<p>Agencies and Schools Hold Meetings</p>
<h3 id="e170">Must Follow the Rudiments of People's Rights <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Received an Order from the Executive Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Forwarded to Subordinates for Information and Compliance</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received an instruction from the Executive Yuan yesterday, saying: In order to comply with the order, the National Government's Instruction No. 577 stated: "The Central Executive Committee's Letter No. 16746 stated that training the people in the exercise of the four rights at the beginning of the period of political tutelage is the party's most important task today. The prerequisite for exercising the four rights is to make the people familiar with the rudiments of people's rights. All agencies, schools, and organizations should first be familiar with the rudiments of people's rights so that they can fulfill their responsibility to set an example for the people in exercising the four rights. Recently, it has been found that many agencies and schools under the government's rule have held various meetings that can follow the rudiments of people's rights, but there are also many that have not mastered the order and are chaotic, not only wasting time and reducing efficiency but also indirectly hindering the completion of the period of political tutelage. For this reason, in addition to notifying party departments at all levels to pay attention, a special letter is sent for your reference. It is hoped that all agencies and schools in the country will follow the rudiments of people's rights when holding meetings in order to train and achieve practical results." Therefore, we should comply. In addition to issuing orders and sending letters in reply, we hereby order your hospital to immediately comply and also instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly. It is heard that the instruction has been issued to the various bureaus under its jurisdiction for information.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Vigorously Implements Local Autonomy</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun Appointed Concurrently as Director of the Local Autonomy Training Institute. The Municipal Government, considering Shanghai as a place where people from all walks of life gather and has a large population, believes that the most important task to uphold during the current period of political tutelage is to vigorously implement local autonomy so that it can start anew with the people and live up to the central government's efforts to govern. Since the promulgation of the Municipal Organization Law on May 28 of this year, it has been working hard on the foundation to promote it step by step and see its success as soon as possible. The Municipal Government has divided the original 17 districts of South Shanghai, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Yangjing, Pusong, Tangqiao, Fahua, Yangsi, Caojing, Luxing, Gaohang, Wusong, Yinxing, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Gaoqiao, and Zhenru, according to the latest population statistics totaling 355,648 households, into districts, neighborhoods, and lanes as stipulated by the Municipal Organization Law, and established a Municipal District Division Committee to implement the district division work. It has also divided them into general affairs and investigation groups to be responsible for statistics, mapping, and investigation matters and will delineate autonomous regions in the shortest possible time. The Municipal Government also considers cultivating talents as the fundamental plan for handling local autonomy. Now that the district division work is about to be completed and the autonomous organs should begin to be set up, all candidates below the district chief before the elected district chief is realized must have considerable knowledge and ability to be competent and happy. Therefore, at the beginning of the district division work, it simultaneously prepared to set up a local autonomy personnel training institute, and the organizational preparatory committee actively prepared to train autonomous talents below the district chief. Each term enrolls 200 students, divided into two classes: a special class for those with local autonomy experience, who will be issued lectures by the institute to study on their own and will be gathered for regular examinations; and an ordinary class for those who have been admitted to the institute for training, both with a three-month training period, teaching the Premier's will, the outline of local autonomy, the outline of municipal administration, the outline of social science, and the outline of statistics. After the end of the term, the graduates will be tested, and those who pass will be assigned to various district autonomous organs for three months of practice, and those who pass the best of the grades will be awarded certificates, and those who fail will be ordered to make up their studies. Now, preparations are gradually being made for the institute. Yesterday, the Municipal Government specially appointed Secretary Yu Hongjun to be the director of the institute and ordered him to open it quickly in order to cultivate autonomous talents, he said.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen Going to Beijing This Morning</p>
<p>Said There is a New Plan to Suppress the Communist Bandits. The Handling of the Lu Department Still Awaits Detailed Discussion of Measures.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen, Commander of the newly organized First Division, is scheduled to take a car to Beijing this morning with Secretary Lin Peiran and others. This reporter visited Mr. Zhang's residence yesterday to interview him. According to him, he is coming to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee with the qualifications of a candidate for the Central Executive Committee member. The military affairs in Fujian Province have come to an end, but the Communist bandits in western Fujian are extremely rampant. The most important work after this should be the suppression of the Communist bandits. The disaster of the Communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is the most serious, but today there is a trend of becoming Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong. I have drafted a new plan for thoroughly suppressing them, which can be decided after meeting with Chairman Chiang. I met with Zhu Shaoliang the other day, and the dispatch of Zhu's department to Fujian to suppress the bandits also needs to be discussed with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Outside rumors that the provincial government appointed Lu Xingbang as the commander-in-chief for suppressing bandits in western Fujian were not mentioned when I met with Chairman Yang this morning (7th). In short, the handling of the Lu department will be decided after careful consultation by all parties, he said.</p>

<p>The Local News Censorship Has Not Yet Been Ordered to Be Cancelled</p>
<h3 id="e171">Talk by a Staff Member of the Censorship Office <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Central Standing Committee has resolved to end the anti-rebellion military affairs and stop news censorship. Propaganda Minister Liu Luyin also talked about stopping news censorship immediately. This reporter went to the News Censorship Office yesterday to inquire about when the local news censorship will be cancelled. According to the staff member of the office, news censorship is a work of hard work and dedication. Due to the different subjective positions of individuals and the differences in positions, newspapers must record everything they hear and strive to publish as much news as possible. Censors, on the other hand, are cautious in their work and strive to avoid mistakes. Therefore, there are times when newspapers and the censorship office have different views, which is unavoidable. All colleagues in this office are willing to be relieved of this duty as soon as possible. The Garrison Headquarters telegraphed the Headquarters last year to ask whether the censorship could be cancelled. With the end of this war, Commander Xiong again presented it to the Headquarters for cancellation. Because whether to cancel it or not, the Central Government needs to make a whole discussion, not limited to Shanghai, so the approval has not yet been received, nor has any order been received. The Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>The News Censorship Office was established by order of Commander-in-Chief Chiang two years ago. As soon as a cancellation order is received, the censorship will be stopped immediately, he said.</p>

<p>The National Internal Affairs Conference is scheduled to be formally convened on January 15, 20th year.

After receiving the order, the bureau considered that the municipal public debt was originally earmarked for various construction projects, but the various projects were still being carried out according to the original plan, and the municipal treasury had advanced more than 400,000 yuan, so it should step up the continued raising of municipal public debt to enrich the municipal treasury and complete the various construction projects as soon as possible. It has issued a circular to all subordinate collection offices for compliance with the Municipal Government's order, and at the same time, it is investigating the households that purchased municipal public debt at the collection offices but did not pay, and is urging them to pay by a certain date, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Liu Zhi Telephonically Requests Expedited Delivery of Pay for the 20th Route Army <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Jiangnan Provincial Government Chairman Liu Zhi urgently telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the 31st of last month, requesting the swift dispatch of pay for the troops under the command of Zhang Fang, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army. An excerpt of the telegram is as follows: Urgent delivery is required; no delays are permitted along the way. Addressed to Commander-in-Chief Chiang at Fenghua: I, your subordinate, have thoroughly investigated the matter. Since the various units under the command of Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fang of the 20th Route Army were successively formed in August, September, and October, the pay received has been meager, with each soldier receiving only three or four yuan, totaling less than one month's worth. I am well aware of their immense hardship. The units in southern Henan have been reorganized into one division and three brigades by Director He. The units in western Henan have not yet been fully inspected. However, the sustenance for these divisions has not been disbursed for a long time, and the provision of cotton clothing is also lacking. Currently, the weather is cold, and the soldiers lack clothing and food, suffering from hunger and cold. If assistance is not provided promptly, it will be difficult for the starving troops to endure. I earnestly request that you instruct the management office to swiftly disburse the clothing and food expenses for the one division and three brigades in southern Henan, and also provide funds for the ongoing maintenance of the units in western Henan to alleviate their immediate crisis. The route army urgently needs 50,000 sets of cotton military clothing. Due to the continuous rain and cold weather, further delays are unacceptable. I earnestly request that they be dispatched in full and transported to Henan day and night for distribution. This matter concerns the suffering of the route army and the security of the region, so I dare to report it directly. I await your instructions on how to proceed. Your subordinate, Liu Zhi, respectfully bows. World Seal.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Ma Hongkui Went to Nanjing Last Night <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui, Commander-in-Chief of the 15th Route Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force, originally intended to wait in Shanghai to personally present important matters to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. However, upon receiving a telegram from Liang Guanying stating that he would be entering Beijing on the 7th of the month and requesting an immediate meeting in Beijing, Ma decided to go to Nanjing to await Commander-in-Chief Chiang, hoping to meet with Liang first to discuss everything. Accordingly, he departed last night (the 7th) at 11:00 PM, accompanied by Secretary-General Feng Chengyuan and a party of more than ten people, on the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express train. It is also reported that Liang Guanying's troops have already departed from Guide towards Jiangsu Province and will be stationed in Huaiyin, Jiangdu, Tongzhou, and other places, under the command of Zhang Zhijiang, who is in charge of handling the affairs of clearing the countryside and suppressing bandits. Other news is also recorded below: (1) Due to natural disasters and human suffering in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan, many young children from various places have been rescued and sent to Beiping by charitable organizations.

<p>China Merchants Bureau Convenes a Meeting with Employees</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Employees' Improved Treatment</p>
<p>Employee Representatives Extremely Satisfied</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Commissioner Li Zhonggong convened a meeting with employees of the five docks at the bureau yesterday. Representatives of the employees' union, Yu Xianting, Zhang Yuanqi, Shen Shouru, Tang Zhiyun, Shan Xishou, etc., were present. First, Mr. Li announced the gist of the meeting, stating that since assuming the position of commissioner, Zhonggong has exerted all his efforts to maintain and reorganize the China Merchants Bureau, which everyone knows, and has paid particular attention to guaranteeing the position of employees and improving their treatment. For more than two months since taking office, he has not wanted to make hasty changes to the employees of the five docks, nor has he used a single private individual. This can also serve as proof. As for the dismissal of the three employees, Zhou, Yang, and Li, during the tenure of the late Chief Zhao, officials are currently being instructed to thoroughly investigate the matter, striving to uphold impartiality and ensuring that the bureau's discipline, laws, and the order and public interest of the employees are not harmed. The representatives are also members of the employees' union, that is, servants of the organization. In the future, if there are opinions to be presented that are beneficial to the China Merchants Bureau, a state-owned shipping enterprise, they will be accepted sincerely. Subsequently, employee union representative Yu Xianting and others spoke, declaring that they represented all employees in supporting the National Government's policy of nationalizing the China Merchants Bureau and the meaning of Commissioner Li's talk. They did not inquire further about Chief Zhao's arrears in salary and other matters. After speaking, the representatives left with satisfaction, expressing their satisfaction.</p>
<p>Canada's Harsh Treatment of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>A Letter from the Vancouver Chinese Benevolent Association</p>
<p>Please Seriously Negotiate with the Canadian Trade Mission</p>
<p>The Vancouver Chinese Benevolent Association of Canada sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that Canadian merchants are visiting China, hoping to seize our country's commercial rights. We respectfully request that your chamber take this opportunity to tell the Canadian merchants about the injustices of the Canadian people's harsh treatment of our overseas Chinese. The National Chamber of Commerce of Canada has selected fifty Canadian merchants to travel together to China. They set sail from this port on the 16th of October aboard the Canadian Pacific Company's Empress of Russia, landing in Japan first and then arriving in Shanghai, scheduled to arrive at the port on the 10th of November. Their declared aim is to promote friendly relations between Chinese and Canadian businessmen, but their real purpose is to introduce Canadian goods and sell them in our country, with timber, wheat, grains, fish, and milk being the main items. Trade and commerce are recognized as legitimate actions by all countries today, which is originally nothing strange. However, the Canadians seek to sell Canadian goods in China, absorbing our people's wealth and resources, not hesitating to travel thousands of miles, lowering their heads and humbling themselves to please our people. At the same time, the Canadians in their own country, officials and civilians alike, regard finding ways to harshly treat Chinese overseas Chinese as their only important task. Even bureaucrats and politicians often use anti-Chinese policies as a shortcut to advancement, resulting in an endless stream of anti-Chinese regulations that are constantly updated. Since the Canadian government implemented the 43 harsh immigration regulations against China on June 30, 1923, all types of Chinese people other than Chinese government personnel have been refused entry into Canada. Also, for example, the constitution of British Columbia does not allow Chinese people born in the country the right to vote. Their intention is to prevent Chinese people born in the country from having the right to vote. If they find out that someone usually advocates anti-Chinese policies, they will reject him when it comes to elections, and not elect him, because they want to get a majority of the votes, so they have something to worry about and dare not advocate anti-Chinese policies. Another example is the regulations to ban agricultural produce markets, the minimum wage regulations, the regulations to limit the working hours of workers, the factory inspection regulations, and the case of restricting overseas Chinese from hiring Western women to work. The above-mentioned harsh regulations are specifically designed for our overseas Chinese. This is the main point, clearly revealed. Other minor details are nitpicking, and the harshness is countless. Our overseas Chinese are bound and oppressed by various harsh regulations and are suffering every day. They are in a state of upside-down waiting for relief. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity of Canadian merchants coming to China to seek friendly relations between China and Canada, we humbly request that your chamber, when meeting with these merchants, bring up the cruel methods of the Canadians' harsh treatment of overseas Chinese, which greatly violate humanity and disregard justice, and tell them, hoping that they will return to their country and promote and explain to their people, realize something, abolish the harsh regulations, and adopt a treaty of equal treatment in commerce. We have always admired your esteemed chamber's concern for overseas Chinese and your unwavering attention to them, and we will be happy to rescue overseas Chinese from fire and water and put them on the agenda. We are truly grateful for your kindness. Sincerely, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Wuhu Chamber of Commerce Requests Extension for Closing Accounts</p>
<h3 id="e181">Set the End Date as February 15th of the Following Year <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: Since our chamber received the government's announcement of the implementation of the national calendar last year, we immediately notified all businesses to comply. Since summer, there has been no objection. However, the rampant bandits have been rampant for years, and the harvests in the past five years have not been good. This year's wheat season was poor, and rice was scarce and expensive. The launch of peace and industry has been depressed, and financial resources have been blocked. The summer festival's collection of accounts has not been completed. Although this year we were fortunate enough to have an autumn harvest, the grain prices hurt farmers, and financial resources are still sluggish. The autumn festival's collection of accounts is less than 20%. If the accounts of the two festivals are like this, then the collection of accounts for the New Year will definitely not be completed on time. Moreover, the period at the end of December is very close to the end of September. Agricultural products have not yet been converted into money to pay off debts. How can the accounts of stores be closed? Since the accounts of stores cannot be closed, how can the funds used by Wuhu money houses be settled? If one party only knows to abide by the closing date and strictly urge the payment of debts, and the debtors cannot comply, they will inevitably sue to the law. A single hair moves the whole body. Not only will there be endless disputes in Wuhu stores, I am afraid that the places involved in wholesale accounts will also be overturned. Stores and money houses will suffer the same harm. We cannot but take care of both sides. Yesterday, the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees decided to invoke Executive Yuan Order No. 4158 of the 18th year to postpone the New Year's closing of accounts by one month to provide relief. After the New Year's holiday, stores will only collect debts and not release debts. At that time, agricultural products have entered the market, and financial activity will be limited for one month. The accounts can be completed. In addition to submitting reports to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Anhui Provincial Government for filing, we should also telegraph to inquire and hope that you will immediately notify your city's banks and money houses that all Wuhu's annual accounts will end on February 15th of the following year to avoid squeezing and achieve dual benefits. Sincerely, Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. After receiving the letter, the city has notified both the Silver and Money Houses.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News of the Mishap of the Japanese Ship Hakusan Maru</p>
<p>Shanghai Passengers Have All Landed</p>
<p>Now Grounded on a Shoal in Kobe Unloading Cargo</p>
<p>The Japanese Mail Company's European liner Hakusan Maru is the company's first-class mail ship with a net registered tonnage of 13,350 tons. This time, it was returning to Japan from Europe via Shanghai. Unexpectedly, on its way from Shanghai to Japan, it had a collision accident in Kobe. One passenger also died. The news received by the company yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Collision Situation: It was found that the Hakusan Maru left Shanghai on the 4th and was heading to the 3rd Pier of the Hatoba Promontory in Kobe at 3:35 PM on the 6th. It happened that the Norwegian freighter Denmark (net registered tonnage 5,500 tons) was departing from Kobe. When the two ships were approaching, the water was turbulent and the wind was strong, making it impossible for them to give way to each other. As a result, the bow of the Denmark struck the waist of the Hakusan Maru. Fortunately, the captain of the Hakusan Maru, Kato Michi, quickly reversed and retreated, avoiding being cut in two. However, a large hole had been punched in the outer hull of the coal bunker, and seawater flooded into the cabin. The Hakusan Maru immediately tilted towards the sea, almost capsizing. The captain urgently ordered the ship to run aground on a shoal to maintain the hull.</p>
<p>Passengers Rescued: The impact force was extremely strong at the time of the collision. There were many passengers on board traveling from Europe to Japan. Passengers disembarking in Japan from Shanghai included Chen Zhengye, Wu Lianshan, Fang Guoyun, Ye Wanxing, and Japanese nationals Tongguchi Ito, Saito, and Moyu, a total of ten people. They rushed to the deck trying to escape. A 68-year-old British priest fell and died on the ship. The captain ordered the sailors to first release small boats and carry all the passengers on board, large and small, ashore. At that time, the ship was half tilted and people could not stand on the sea surface. Yesterday afternoon, the local port received a telegram stating that all the passengers on board had been rescued safely. Everyone praised it.</p>
<p>Rescue Situation: After this incident occurred, the captain telegraphed the head office for help. The company dispatched more than ten iron barges and small boats to the scene. First, the mail and important cargo were unloaded. The Kobe Customs also sent a small boat to the scene of the accident to assist and protect the ships. The company is now planning to extract as much of the cargo as possible and then tow the ship into the shipyard for major repairs. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Shanghai office received a telegram from the head office stating that the dangerous period for the ship had passed, but the cargo in each cabin had suffered considerable water damage.</p>
<p>Notice to Passengers: Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai branch immediately issued a notice stating that the Hakusan Maru had collided with the Denmark in Kobe, and all passengers had been rescued without injury. Repair work is now underway. The ship was originally scheduled to depart on its 18th voyage to Europe next month on the 15th. Now, it is impossible to make a decision and the trip will be vacant. Passengers who have booked seats on the ship have been instructed to take the Hazuna Maru to Europe instead.</p>
<p>Responsibility Question: The question of responsibility for this collision between the two ships is still unclear at the moment. It must be investigated on the spot together with the Denmark side before it can be determined. The bow of the Denmark was also damaged, while the damage to the hull of the Hakusan Maru, the water damage to the cargo, and the losses due to the missed voyage are very large, amounting to at least hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p>

<p>Su Bo Lie Fu Returns to Shanghai after Cycling Around the World</p>
<h3 id="e183">Su Bo Lie Fu Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Departed from Shanghai Two Years Ago</p>
<p>Welcomed by the Russian Youth Association</p>
<p>Russian youth Su Bo Lie Fu, who set off from Shanghai two years ago, has returned to Shanghai after successfully completing his journey around the world by bicycle, traversing three continents and traveling more than 34,000 miles. He arrived in port yesterday aboard the Nagasaki Maru from Japan. When Mr. Su set off, he only carried a few photos, a set of clothes, and twenty yuan in silver. After arriving in Hong Kong and Bangkok, he was fortunate enough to receive assistance from local people, who gave him a new bicycle, allowing him to continue his journey. He then traveled through India, England, and various European countries before crossing the ocean to America and traversing the American continent. Now, he has returned to Shanghai from America. The local Youth Association specially sent representatives to the pier to welcome him and held a meeting at the association's headquarters at 311 Hualong Road to celebrate his success.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Su, he left Shanghai with his bicycle on November 7th of the previous year. After arriving in Hong Kong by boat, his travel expenses ran out and difficulties arose due to his nationality. Fortunately, a Norwegian shipowner took pity on him and offered him a free ride to Bangkok, the capital of Siam. However, at that time, his funds were exhausted and he was almost like a fish stranded in a dry rut. Fortunately, the British press in Bangkok provided assistance, allowing him to continue his journey. Mr. Li Anjun of Bangkok even gave him a new bicycle, which was even more timely. At that time, a certain young overseas Chinese also had grand ambitions and was riding his bicycle together. Unfortunately, he was bitten by a snake a few hours after departure and died. Mr. Su was fortunate enough to escape unharmed. Afterwards, he continued to travel alone, spending 24 days in the wilderness of Siam. He relied solely on coconuts and milk for food and drink. The bread and clean water he carried had long been used up. The people along the way treated him very well. When he arrived at the Straits Settlements border, the British refused him entry and sent him back to Bangkok by train. Later, the British Consul in Bangkok made an exception and gave him an entry permit, allowing him to re-enter the Straits Settlements. From Penang to Singapore, he traveled 508 miles in five days. After arriving in Singapore, he used the money he earned from selling photos along the way to buy a motorized bicycle and traveled with a German companion towards Rangoon. Before long, the German encountered danger and returned. Mr. Su continued to travel alone to Burma, passing through Rangoon to Butwan to see its chief. He then passed through Bombay and Delhi and arrived in Lahore. After the Afghan authorities refused him entry, he decided to pass through Ben Ze Bai and traveled 787 kilometers across the desert in 16 days to reach Karachi. He was favored by the local British officials and given a new motorized bicycle. He then entered Persia and was shot at by Kurdish bandits, but managed to escape by driving fast, fortunately without injury. He then passed through Tehran to Baghdad, crossed the Arabian Desert, and arrived at Dama Yi. This was the most difficult part of the whole journey. After arriving in Dama Yi, he continued to Palestine. In Jerusalem, he visited the 103-year-old Greek Orthodox Church bishop and was presented with a Jesus cross. He then went to Jaffa and took a boat to France, landing in Marseille. From there, he went to Rome via Paris, entered Yugoslavia</p>
<p>He then went to see King Alexander I. Then he turned back to the northwest and visited Dr. Eckener in Germany, who presented him with a Graf Zeppelin commemorative medal. Then he went to Belgium and then to England. The British treated him very well and he was given free food and lodging in a hotel, as well as a boat ticket to the United States. In the United States, he passed through New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle before entering Vancouver, Canada. He then took a boat back to Shanghai via Japan, passing through twenty countries and traveling more than 34,000 miles.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Principal of Zhongshan Public School in Makassar Expelled and Sent Back to China <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Dutch Authorities Suppress Party Affairs Propaganda</p>
<p>Treat Overseas Chinese with Extreme Harshness</p>
<p>(Huadong News Agency) Feng Han Yue, the principal of Zhongshan Public School in Makassar, Nanyang, was originally sent by Ding Weifen, the training minister of the Central Party Department, to reorganize the overseas Chinese education in Nanyang. Mr. Feng went to the Netherlands in February of last year and has been there for a year and a half. He has spared no effort in reorganizing overseas Chinese education. As a result, the number of students in the school, which originally had only more than 130 students, has now increased to more than 300. While he was working hard to reorganize, he unexpectedly suffered the jealousy of the local Dutch authorities. The Dutch authorities have always strictly suppressed Chinese in the Netherlands, and especially hated propaganda related to party affairs. Since Zhongshan Public School is presided over by the branch of the Kuomintang stationed in the area, the authorities have been constantly vigilant against the school. If there is a minor incident, Mr. Feng will be summoned for questioning. In total, he was</p>
<p>summoned more than thirty times this year. On September 27, Mr. Feng was suddenly detained by the local authorities and then ordered to be deported back to China. Mr. Feng had no choice but to stumble back to his country and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. According to Mr. Feng, the Dutch authorities' actions towards Chinese are extremely harsh and outrageous.</p>

He led inspectors Tang Jian, Liu Shaokui, Wu Changkai, police officers Wang Chengying and Bao Tan Zhang Shaoqing, Xie Futang, Yin Zhanqing, and West Inspector Tan Er Fou to North Xizang Road, Arabers Trail, and arrested the thief Dong Yushu. Then, they went to No. 227 nearby and successively arrested Yu Ansheng (aka Ziqing), Wang Fusheng (aka A San), Shen Xingda (aka Xingsheng), Shen Yonglin, Sun Chansheng, Xia Jintang, Zhang Rongfu, Zhu Xiangting and nine other accomplices.

They also went to No. 24 on the same road and found a handgun and five</p>
<p>bullets. They were all taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. The lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, stating that the police had not yet investigated the criminal behavior of the defendants, so he requested a postponement of the hearing for fourteen days. The guns and bullets were presented to the court. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the evidence and questioned the defendants, ordering them to be returned to custody and scheduled to be re-examined on November 21.</p>

A couplet was hung at the entrance of the field, which read: "Rely on a good time for the exhibition, it is good to be idle and quiet, and have less fun; take advantage of the chrysanthemum festival and discuss how to promote the urbanization of the city and the countryside." Entering the gate, there are winding streams and corridors, bamboo forests, and rocks stacked to form a mountain. The mountain has a small pond with a sprinkler tube and goldfish. The rocks on the mountain are decorated with chrysanthemums, and green potted plants are mixed in between, adding a unique elegance. There are two extremely high chrysanthemum mountains in the courtyard, one woven from yellow chrysanthemums to form the four characters of the Three Principles of the People, and the other stacked into a character shape, demonstrating the propaganda of the doctrine and the ingenuity of the layout. The flower rooms and greenhouses in the field are newly built this year. The mounds are cultivated into mounds at the Songgou winding, and a thatched pavilion is built on top. Climbing up, you can overlook the ferry across the Huangpu River. Mr. Zhu Futian plans to build a small pavilion here to climb and overlook, this move of the field is to commemorate the predecessors and to fulfill Mr. Zhu's unfinished ambition. At the secluded place of the exhibition, a special refined room is opened to display pens and ink, and dozens of pages of jade paper and ruler pages decorated with porcelain green are named Juying Hongti, which means that they want to get the poems of poets, recluses, famous scholars, and painters, and leave traces of snow and mud.</p>

<p>Ni Xiuzhen sues Zhu Haisheng</p>
<h3 id="e190">On Grounds of Luring and Abandonment <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Ni Xiuzhen, a woman residing at No. 108, Hongqing Lane, Xin Zha Road, recently hired lawyer Gu Jirong to sue Zhu Haisheng, a foreman at the Rui Rong Iron Factory in Yangshupu, for crimes of luring and abandonment, among others, at the Special District Court. The main points of her complaint are as follows: The plaintiff's father passed away early, and she lived with her mother. In March of the sixteenth year of the Republic (when she was only seventeen years old), Zhu Haisheng lured her in every possible way, forcibly engaging in ambiguous cohabitation, falsely claiming to be unmarried and vowing lifelong commitment. The plaintiff, young and naive, was ultimately violated and then lived with him at No. 9 Qingdao Road. Last year, she gave birth to a child who died within a few months. The plaintiff, based on the defendant's prior promises, urged him to quickly complete the marriage ceremony. The defendant repeatedly used excuses such as not having raised enough money, but the defendant’s monthly expenses were eighty yuan. The plaintiff treated him with utmost care as if he were sincere, causing her to delay for more than two years. Unexpectedly, in December of this year, the defendant became increasingly distant, cutting off the monthly allowance and eventually disappearing from the plaintiff's residence. After much investigation, it was discovered that the defendant had built another home on Huade Road, in Shende Lane, abandoning the old for the new and forgetting to return. When the plaintiff demanded living expenses, she was beaten. The plaintiff cried and complained, but her mother, Ms. Qian, was also at a loss. Attempts to reason with the defendant were also rejected, leaving the plaintiff in a dilemma, unable to become a wife and without a way to support herself, feeling a sense of hopelessness. Nothing in the world is more cruel than this. Considering that the plaintiff is a young and weak girl with an unstable will, mistakenly trusting a scoundrel and being abused in this way, even though it can be said that the calamity was self-inflicted, what else can be said? But the plaintiff's future is bleak, with no hope for the future. How can this be tolerated by natural justice, human emotions, law, and morality? Therefore, she petitions the court to sentence him under Article 257 of the criminal law for enticing a woman under twenty years of age to leave the guardianship of a person with parental rights, and to award her alimony of five thousand yuan. Yesterday, Judge Cheng Shangfeng held a court session to collect testimony. As a result, the court ordered a postponement of one week for further interrogation. The defendant, Zhu Haisheng, was absent due to being out of town. Lawyer Ye Kang appeared in court on his behalf, stating that the plaintiff's accusation under Article 257 of the criminal law was inappropriate. The plaintiff, Ni Xiuzhen, and her mother appeared in court, stating that she has a mother, a younger brother, and a grandmother. Zhu lured her, and after giving birth to a child, Zhu neglected her, hence the lawsuit. Judge Cheng asked Ms. Xiuzhen's mother a few questions and then ordered a postponement to summon Zhu Haisheng for further questioning.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhenxin, a resident of No. 3, Tianfu Lane, Tiande Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Hongkou, usually works abroad. His family consists only of his elderly mother, Zhang Ma, and his wife, Zhang Deng. Since her husband is not often at home, Zhang Deng is lonely and inevitably leads a dissolute life, making friends with younger women and spending days and nights out, making it a habit. Zhang Ma reprimanded her, but she did not listen. The other day, Zhang Zhenxin returned home, and Zhang Ma told her son everything about his wife. Zhang Zhenxin rebuked his wife. Zhang Deng then made trouble with her mother-in-law, arguing verbally. Zhang Deng lost her temper and smashed a bowl, breaking Zhang Ma's head and causing bleeding. Zhang, a police officer, arrested his wife and detained her at the Third Sub-District of the Fifth District. Yesterday, she was taken to court for investigation and handling.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Judgment in the Old Fire Stove Case <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Chen Laijin from Suzhou, Liu Jiajun from Anhui, and Ren Heibao from Nanjing were making noise and beating Liu Yukang at the old fire stove run by Liu Yukang at No. 805, Pingliang Road, around 4:00 PM the day before. Liu reported to the nearby patrolling police officers Nos. 2438 and 1940 that they were extorting him for twenty yuan. The two Chinese constables arrested Chen, Liu, and Ren together and took them to the Yangshupu Police Station. Five yuan in banknotes were found on Chen. The police chief ordered their detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the case originated from a seven-year-old child from Wuxi, a neighbor of the old fire stove, who went to the plaintiff to get water and started crying after being beaten. His mother went to negotiate, and they argued with each other. The defendants, dissatisfied, also beat the plaintiff. The police station is now charging the defendants with assault, as there is insufficient evidence of extortion. Then, the plaintiff Liu Yukang testified that the three defendants extorted twenty yuan and slapped and punched him. Yang Luo also testified that she sent her young son Yongxing to the plaintiff to get water, but he was beaten and cried. She then went to reason with him and was slapped, kicked, and verbally abused. Therefore, the three neighboring defendants felt injustice and negotiated with him. The testimony of the three defendants was the same as hers, and there was no mention of extorting money. Judge Ge Zhiqin examined the statements and ruled that Chen Laijin, Liu Jiajun, and Ren Heibao would each be fined twenty yuan as a warning.</p>

<p>Callously Watches an Old Woman Die</p>
<p>You Shen, a 63-year-old woman from Suzhou residing at No. 147, Sande Lane, Chenjiabang, is usually devout in her Buddhist faith, worshipping Buddha and respecting gods. Her son, You Runsheng, works as a clerk in a foreign firm and is very filial to his mother. She suddenly suffered from asthma and coughing last month, unable to sleep at night. Her son urgently hired Chinese and Western doctors for diagnosis, but she was too old and weak, and the treatments were ineffective. She superstitiously consulted a male witch from Suzhou residing on Meierjin Road, who claimed to be the "Great Lord of Suzhou." He said that she was haunted by tuberculosis ghosts and afflicted by the Iron Snake and White Tiger constellations and needed to invite more than a dozen Taoist priests to perform rituals to ward off evil spirits, including a packet of incense ashes and a bowl of sacred water, instructing her to sincerely drink them, saying that earthly doctors were useless and that she should rely solely on the Great Lord's treatment, which would reduce her illness by half in three days. Believing this to be true, she and the male witch agreed to invite Taoist priests to perform rituals for three days, including warding off evil spirits, offering sacrifices to heaven, at a cost of sixty-two yuan. The male witch came to her house once a day, charging six yuan eight jiao each visit. Her son burned incense day and night, sincerely asking the Great Lord to heal his mother's illness. However, the Taoist priests performed rituals in the male witch's house, in front of the Great Lord's altar, with loud gongs and drums, from the 5th to yesterday (the 7th), three days of rituals were completed. However, after refusing treatment from Chinese and Western doctors and drinking the sacred water and incense ashes, her condition worsened day by day. Yesterday evening, as the male witch led the Taoist priests to her house to thank the kitchen god and see off the spirits, she died at that moment. The whole family cried loudly. Seeing that things were not going well, the male witch took the opportunity to leave with the Taoist priests without even completing the ritual. The harm of superstition is evident here.</p>

<p>This Year's Business Conditions on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway</p>
<h3 id="e198">Revenue of More Than Seven Million in Seven Months <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has always had more developed passenger and freight transport revenue than the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway because the Shanghai-Nanjing line is longer, runs through more large cities, and is the main route to and from the capital. In recent years, revenue has increased even further. Last year, the total annual operating revenue reached 12,039,881.9 yuan. This year is even better than last year. From January to July of this year, total operating revenue has already reached 7,008,806.7 yuan. Compared to the revenue from January to July last year, this year's revenue has increased by 87,830 yuan. It is expected that the year-end settlement this year will exceed last year's results.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Continued Report on Foreign Ship Seamen Demanding Pay Raise <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Dockworkers Demand Pay Raise; Chinese Seamen on Foreign Ships Demand a Pay Raise Following the Example of Chinese Ships. Negotiations on the case of Chinese seamen on foreign ships demanding increased wages, following the precedent of Chinese ships, have been ongoing for a long time and are about to reach a conclusion. However, the salaries of the dockworkers on each ship are extremely low and have not increased in recent years. Taking advantage of the seamen's pay raise, they also submitted a request to the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin shipping companies to increase their wages across the board. The Seamen's Union is also representing them in this request. Yesterday, the Union received a reply from Taikoo stating that the dockworkers are hired by the Chinese compradors and have nothing to do with the company. In the past, the company gave the Chinese compradors 100 taels of silver per ship for the dockworkers' wages, but now it has increased to 500 taels. The Union believes that since the compradors have increased their income, the dockworkers' wages should also be increased, which is very unreasonable. Union committee members Tang Hesheng, Lu Yongzhi, Ma Zhongxian, and others, representing the dockworkers, went to Shanghai yesterday to contact Mr. Chen, the comprador of the Taikoo Yangtze River ship Poyang, and asked him to increase the wages of the dockworkers. Chen had just left work and came to Shanghai to discuss a raise. The comprador of the Huangpu ship also heard this news and quickly offered to increase the wages by one or two yuan. However, the dockworkers did not agree and insisted on a six-yuan increase across the board. The dockworkers on the Jardine Matheson and Nissin ships have also unanimously started demanding an increase.</p>
<p>Small Dispute Over Seamen's Pay Raise; Taikoo has signed a contract with the labor side regarding the seamen's pay raise, but in the contract, Taikoo only agreed to increase the wages starting in November. The seamen's side requested that the increase start in September. Special Union representative Wang Yongsheng consulted with mediator Yu Qiaqing at Sanbei. Yu said that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily. However, the contract also included the phrase "no more pay raises forever," which the seamen opposed. They requested that this phrase be removed, otherwise, the seamen's side would have to add the phrase "another pay raise in March of next year" to counter it. Yu agreed to discuss this.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Yu Pond Dredging Preparatory Committee held its eighth preparatory meeting at 2:00 PM on the 6th at the Beiqiao Third District Office. Chairman Yang Fulin passed the following resolutions: (1) Discuss the proposal to change the course of the North Bay section of the Qian Pond outlet to the Jinjia River. It was resolved that, based on water conservancy considerations, the channel should be straightened and diverted to the Jinjia River, and the committee should submit separate reports to the county bureau for record. (2) Discuss when to start dredging the Yu Pond. It was resolved to start building the dam on November 30th. (3) Discuss how to raise funds for the dredging expenses before the collection is completed. It was resolved to request the county government to instruct the Finance Bureau to advance 5,000 yuan first, and the remaining amount will be raised separately by each district. (4) Discuss whether the committee should be terminated on a regular basis and whether a river works committee should be established to take charge. It was resolved that a river works committee should be organized in accordance with Article 10 of the Provisional Regulations for Dredging Rivers in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province, and that the committee should be terminated after the river works committee is established. (5) Discuss how the river works committee should be established. It was resolved that the committee should notify the relevant districts to elect reputable individuals as members of the river works committee and report to the committee by the 10th of this month for submission to the county government for record. (6) Discuss when the river works committee should be established. It was decided that the inaugural meeting would be held at 10:00 AM on the 13th of this month at the Third District Office.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Plans to Build a Freight Yard at Ganlu Port</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Railway Bureau Submits a Request to the Ministry of Railways for Approval <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Gentry and merchants in Gaozi Township, Zhenjiang, recognized that the river channel next to the freight yard at the Zhenjiang Jiangbian Station was becoming increasingly silted, and despite repeated dredging, there was no significant improvement, making it difficult to load and unload goods. Therefore, they proposed moving the freight dock to Ganlu Port, west of the station. However, the cost is enormous, so they plan to issue shares to raise funds. The Ministry of Railways has considered the potential for increased revenue and agreed to accept the proposal and submit it to the Ministry of Railways for approval. They are currently extending the station's freight car tracks to the Zhenjiang Jiangbian Customs.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee Discusses Relief Work in Henan <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Foreign Famine Relief Committee received a report from the Kaifeng Henan China Foreign Famine Relief Committee on November 2, which is transcribed as follows: "Since Henan Province has been plagued by drought, locusts, hail, and bandits in recent years, the people have suffered beyond endurance. This spring, war clouds suddenly arose, pervading the Central Plains, and countless people have died in the rain of bullets and artillery fire. Now, after the ravages of war, fertile fields have been transformed into ditches, and huts have been turned into mounds. The displaced refugees have no homes to return to and no land to cultivate. The tragic situation of displacement cannot be fully described even by the Zheng Xia map. Witnessing this suffering, our committee is deeply saddened and urgently seeks to provide relief. The most serious disaster is in eastern Henan. After discussion, it was decided to allocate 30,000 yuan from the committee's existing funds to build the Kaiyong highway to provide relief through work. However, this route only passes through a few counties and does not cover even one-tenth of the disaster area, making it difficult to extend the relief efforts. We have long admired your committee's assistance and enthusiastic commitment to Henan relief. Therefore, we have entrusted our chairman, Liu Hailou, to go to Shanghai to present the details and appeal for help. We have recently received a telegram from Chairman Liu stating that he has already met with your honorable office and that you have shown great concern for the disaster in Henan. He has asked us to formally submit a letter describing the relief measures so that they can be submitted to the meeting. The disaster situation in Henan is difficult to describe. The war in eastern Henan, the natural disasters in western Henan, the banditry in southern Henan, and the defeated soldiers in northern Henan have all contributed to a catastrophe that has not been seen in centuries. There is no way to reverse the situation or provide effective relief. As winter approaches, the dying survivors have no choice but to turn to ditches for shelter. Our committee currently plans to start relief work in the relatively stable areas and is organizing relief through work, including the Kaiyong Road, as well as the Kaixu, Kaikao, and Kaizhou roads, which are all in the war zone. If we can continue to repair these roads, the disaster victims can make a living. However, the project is huge and beyond our capabilities, and the work relief only reaches able-bodied men, leaving the elderly and weak in need of assistance. Therefore, urgent relief measures such as soup kitchens and flat boats should also be planned and maintained. A cup of water can hardly put out a cartload of burning firewood. If your committee can provide strong assistance and allocate funds for the project, then we will gratefully lead the millions of disaster victims in Henan Province to bow our heads and pray." It is heard that the committee believes that, given the cold weather and the fact that the entire province of Henan has been turned into a disaster area with countless people facing starvation, the above plans and winter relief are extremely appropriate and have been submitted to the relief division for discussion in the hope of early implementation.</p>

<p>The Yixing Alumni Association Sends a Telegram to Jiangwan Road, Shanghai Law School: The Yixing Alumni Association of Shanghai Law School sent a telegram yesterday to various newspaper offices and the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reads: "Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a native of our hometown, was invited to teach at the Peide School on Anbon Island in the Dutch East Indies. On the way, she was forcibly raped by the first and second mates of the Java Company's ship. This barbaric act is not only a disgrace to Ms. Xiao personally, but also a disgrace to the entire Chinese nation. Moreover, it is not only a national disgrace but is being used as a tool of Dutch imperialism, treating our people as cattle and horses to be arbitrarily trampled upon. This is not merely a personal matter but a major issue concerning the rise and fall of our national dignity. We humbly request your ministry to base its actions on public opinion and lodge a serious protest. Not yielding to power or letting emotions lead us astray, ensure that the Dutch who despise our nation's barbaric acts are turned into morning dew on the execution ground. Then, our nation may still have the qualification to survive in the world with dignity. If not, how can your ministry face the people of the country, and how can you face the nations of the world? The honor and disgrace of our nation depend on this one action. May Zhang Guoyan emphasize national humiliation and send an urgent telegram filled with grief. Yixing Alumni Association of Shanghai Law School, Yu."</p>
<p>Citizens of Harbin Send a Telegram to the Overseas Chinese Federation: The Overseas Chinese Federation received a telegram from Cheng Ying and more than forty other citizens of Harbin, which reads: "Having read the reports and learned of the outrage in your telegram regarding the rape of female teacher Xiao Xin'an by the first and second mates of the Java Company's ship "Zhibade," we are filled with righteous indignation. If the first and second mates are not given the most severe punishment, how can we deter others in the future and how can we wash away this shame? Ms. Xiao, as a weak woman, is under the pressure of the Dutch. Having been falsely accused, she cannot live and cannot die, satisfying the lust of the first and second mates and bringing shame to our entire nation. Who does not have sisters or families? If we do not provide assistance to Ms. Xiao, how can we ensure that our own sisters, wives, and daughters will not be treated the same as Ms. Xiao, as instruments of pleasure for the Dutch? All our compatriots should immediately implement the federation's proposal to sever all ties with the company, not travel on the company's ships, not ship goods on the company's ships, and not post advertisements on the company's ships, as well as their import and export news. At the same time, we should petition the government to lodge a serious protest, demanding that the Dutch government severely punish the first and second mates and issue a formal apology to our government. The people here will fully support your federation. The telegram is sent with utmost indignation."</p>
<p>The Seamen's General Union Sends a Telegram: "Xiao Xin'an, a woman, is a citizen of China and a teacher in our culture. Her origin is so great, her status is so high, and her body is so precious and dignified. Yet, she was seduced by the Dutch first and second mates of the Java Company's ship "Zhibade," and when they failed, they raped her. They even dared to strangle her neck and poke her chest, strip her pants and force her to die. Afterwards, the ship's doctor even fabricated a story about her being mentally ill to cover up their crime. This is all because they rely on the power of their imperialism to bully our great country, China, thinking that there is no one to stop them. Therefore, they dare to indulge their lust, commit rape and murder, and then spread rumors and arbitrarily slander her. Nothing in the world is more tragic than this, and no injustice is more unjust than this. If we allow such people to go unpunished, I fear that this trend will continue, and all our virtuous and dignified women who travel by sea for a living will be like meat on the chopping block, fish in a pot. The system and prestige of our Republic of China will also be swept away. All of us Chinese people, sisters of the same Chinese Han race, and those who have been oppressed and trampled upon by imperialists and their running dogs, now witness her shame and pain, and are forced to commit suicide. How can we not be filled with grief and come forward to help? The club is taking revenge for Miss Xiao and considering the reputation of our China. In addition to formally submitting a serious protest to the central government and sending personnel to announce a boycott of the company's ships and seamen, we dare to send a telegram to the whole country, respectfully requesting that all circles unite to strive for a victory and must put forward the following conditions: (1) Legally handle the rape and injury of the first mate, etc. (2) Compensate Miss Xiao for her reputation, medical expenses, etc. (3) The government of the country concerned must formally apologize to our national government and declare that such incidents must not happen again in the future. The club is willing to lead the entire 800,000 seamen to act as vanguards, striving to achieve the goal of victory before. With utmost indignation and pain, I respectfully look forward to your wise judgment. The Organizing Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation pays homage."</p>

They did not witness the beatings. The Head Western Detective reported that a Western doctor had confirmed Mei Bao's death was due to beatings. He requested a verdict. Cao Qiu admitted to minor reprimands, but otherwise evaded the questioning. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that the evidence proved Cao Qiu's guilt and sentenced her to one year in a women's prison as a warning to others.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Xiaonan was a prominent member of the Revolutionary Party.

<h3 id="e220">Xie Liheng's Message to Shanghai's Chinese Medicine Community <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Xie Liheng, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, Addresses Shanghai's Central District:</p>
<p>A public notice to the Shanghai Chinese Medicine community: The Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association was jointly organized by the China Medical Union, the China National Medical Association, and the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Society to unite Chinese medicine practitioners in the city and protect their professional interests. Now, the People's Training Committee has ordered the merger of the three medical groups into the Association, clarifying that disunity should be replaced by unity, which is in line with the initial intent of combining the various medical groups. Unexpectedly, the leaders of the medical groups have responded by publishing notices to withdraw from the Association. If there are deficiencies in the Association's content and management, you should work together to rectify them, eliminate the bad and preserve the good, so that the Association can develop further. If everyone engages in withdrawing from the Association and undermining its foundation, then the hard work of combining in recent years will be in vain. Not only will the thousands of registered Chinese medicine practitioners in Shanghai lose legal protection, but it will also increase ridicule from the outside world. I personally believe that this is inappropriate. I hope you will consider this carefully, safeguard the overall situation, and enable the Chinese medicine community to have a formal and positive unity, so that we can progress in our careers. This is what I hope for.</p>

<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>Men under thirty often waste valuable time engaging in reckless and foolish acts. Between thirty and fifty, they try to repent. After fifty, they boast about the things they did in their youth, praising themselves incessantly.</p>
<p>If men could clearly express a precise and unchangeable standard for women, human life would be simpler, sweeter, and more peaceful.</p>
<p>A woman is an animal that digs to the root and is good at asking questions. If she gets the answer "yes" from a boyfriend to the question of whether he loves her, she will ask him why he loves her. Men either win or lose at this point.</p>
<p>Women often like to ask men questions and interrogate them for reasons, but men are most afraid of being questioned, and their actions are often unreasonable. There seems to be a natural contradiction between the two. However, love between men and women does not diminish because of this. There is an incredible magic in it.</p>
<p>When a child is building a wall out of mud and stones, he does not want anyone to help him, or he will lose the fun. Similarly, when a man falls in love with a woman, he does not want anyone to help him.</p>
<p>Men are like cats. As long as you let them be free and comfortable, they will sometimes obey you very faithfully. Women are like dogs. As long as you constantly play with them and give them things to eat, they will obey you very docilely.</p>
<p>A man can lose the last hair on his head, his last friend, and his last dollar. However, unless his last enthusiasm is lost, the fire in his heart will never be extinguished.</p>
<p>"Why did you get married?" Nine out of ten men cannot answer this simple question, and nine out of ten women refuse to answer it.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Cibei Education Circle's Bicycle Race <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Jieyu</p>
<p>The teaching staff of over twenty schools, including Cibei Xianzheng, Qiu Shi, and Jintang, jointly organized a bicycle race in the foothills of Mount Fulong. A friend sent a letter describing the small details of the event, which are excerpted below.</p>
<p>The White-Haired Judges: Several judges were invited, all prominent figures in the county. On the day of the race, Mr. Weng Ruiqing from Minghe was publicly elected as the chairman of the judges. Mr. Weng is old and his beard and eyebrows are white, and he is gradually balding. However, he still mustered his energy to judge fairly, showing that his enthusiasm for sports has not diminished with age.</p>
<p>The Mountain Road is Steep and Difficult: The contestants usually practice on the flat and expansive playground, which is easy to ride. Unexpectedly, the race location was set on the steep and difficult Mount Fulong. Thorns blocked the way, and gravel obstructed the wheels. The riders bounced and leaped, not only causing pain in their buttocks, but also causing them to fall and bleed.</p>
<p>Elementary School Student Wins the Championship: Shao, a fourth-grade student at Jintang School, is only fourteen years old. He lives near the foothills of Mount Fulong. This time, he participated in the race with a team of thirty people. Few were able to reach halfway up the mountain. Only Shao was familiar with the mountain, so it was fitting that he won the championship.</p>
<p>Female Teachers are Afraid of Difficulties: Two or three female teachers also intended to show off their skills. However, when they saw the path, they immediately became afraid of the difficulties and canceled their participation, returning in disappointment.</p>

<p>— Zhao Dingming</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Peiyi, also known as Zhenhou, is skilled in photography. He and his associates Hu Boxiang and Lang Jingshan founded Huashe, the only photography organization famous at home and abroad, and organized with Mr. Guo Xiqi, Wang Dafo, Zhu Shouren, Hu Bozhou, and others. On November 1st, at the Zhenxin Club in Zhenxin Lane, Dongxin Bridge, South Shanghai, he celebrated the marriage of his talented son, Yingchao. Mr. Yingchao likes photography, calligraphy, and painting, and is especially good at sculpture, a budding artist. The bride, Ms. Yu Liying, is good at poetry. She studied at Zhirenyong Girls' School and was known as a female poet.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, I and Mr. Hu Bozhou went to congratulate them. Looking around the four walls, we saw congratulatory scrolls and silk banners everywhere. The ink calligraphy and congratulatory couplets sent by Wang Yiting, Zhang Shanzi, Xu Yongqing, Hu Boxiang, Jiang Xiaojian, Yang Qingjing, Fang Xuegu, and other painters, writers, and photographers were the most elegant and refined. The stone sculpture of Cupid presented by the artist Zhang Chenbo was the most precious.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, Ms. Zhou Hufeng, Ms. Lang Lei Peizhi, and Mrs. Wang Dafo arrived in droves. Congratulatory guests poured through the door. Subsequently, more than forty foreign male and female guests arrived one after another. Mr. Zhenhou shook hands with them one by one, with the utmost courtesy. The foreign guests also expressed their congratulations. Yingchao saw this and rushed forward to shake hands and bow. He bowed hastily to the newly arrived relatives and friends. The Western women laughed out loud when they saw this, which was due to the difference in Chinese and Western etiquette. However, it was also because Yingchao was tall and bowed 120 degrees to everyone, which easily attracted attention.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, the wedding ceremony began with the sound of drums and music. The bride, Ms. Yu Liying, was exquisite, petite, graceful, and beautiful. Her height only reached the groom's chest. The guests were surprised because the bride and groom were both nineteen years old and their birthdays were only five days apart. Mr. Shen Lianfang officiated the wedding. Mr. Xie Zhonghe and Mr. Pan Digong were the introducers, and Mr. Li Changjue was the master of ceremonies, all filled with joy. First, the officiant gave a speech, followed by congratulatory speeches from the guests. Mr. Yan Duhe and Mr. Zhou Shoujuan gave speeches that were extremely humorous and witty. The ceremony was completed at four o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Cheng Yanqiu and Chen Liqing <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Chuan</p>
<p>Shi Nai'an's *Water Margin* is a supremely excellent work under heaven, and Jin Shengtan long ago included it in his list of books for talented scholars. However, strictly speaking, the latter half is somewhat lax compared to the concise and moving first few dozen chapters. Yu Zhonghua of Shanyin wrote *The Pacification of Bandits*, and many ridiculed him for being like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, overestimating himself. Yet, the first half of his work, depicting the personality and behavior of Chen Liqing, establishes a unique style beyond the 108 heroes of the former book, making the reader feel as if a charming and lively young woman is about to leap from the pages. The meticulous planning, careful management, layout, and writing are all masterful, the crystallization of the author's efforts. I have often said that *Water Margin* encompasses countless Beijing operas and Kunqu operas, a natural source of material for playwrights. The first half of *The Pacification of Bandits*, before the establishment of the Yuanbi stronghold, is also excellent dramatic material. The veteran performer Yu Yuqin (i.e., Yu She) once staged *The Pacification of Bandits*, starting from "Strolling Through the Temple" and ending with "Anle Village." The scene of burning and looting Anle Village was particularly intense and lively, especially the fighting scenes, which were superb. She was once praised as "Female Changpo." Recently, Yanqiu has been rehearsing *Chen Liqing*, based on Yuqin's version but with revisions and insertions, truly perfecting it. The main part, from the father-daughter argument to escaping from Tokyo, is slightly different from Yuqin's version. The role of Chen Liqing in this play is extremely difficult to portray. She is sometimes rebellious and sometimes… it is necessary to hold fast to the three qualities of (ingenuousness), (heroism), and (chivalry). Her obedience and submissiveness to Chen Xizhen, revealing the natural bond and true feelings between father and daughter, is greatly beneficial to the world and people's hearts today. Her affected manners and forced smiles towards Gao Yanei are entirely depicted in reverse, to emphasize the venom of the arrow pavilion beating the horse. Her ability to hit the target with one shot revitalizes the audience. Yanqiu has pondered this play for a long time and is comfortable and skillful with it. However, she is unwilling to show it lightly and has never performed it even in ordinary times. It is said that rehearsals are underway and it will soon be staged. Those who love watching Yanqiu's plays must not miss it, and those who enjoy reading *The Pacification of Bandits* should especially not miss it.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Impressions of West Lake (II) <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Huijian</p>
<p>From the Broken Bridge, I boarded a boat, passing along Bai Causeway and through the Brocade Belt Bridge, venturing into the Outer Lake and temporarily anchoring at Gushan. From Baoshi Mountain, I captured a scene with Baochu Pagoda at its center. The setting sun bathed the mountain in colors like rose quartz, and the northwestern part was ablaze with vibrant clouds. The beauty of the evening scene is beyond the power of words to describe. After admiring it for a long time, the boatman urged me to depart, so we proceeded west along Gushan, passing the Crane Release Pavilion, Lin Hejing's Tomb, and Feng Xiaoqing's Tomb, stopping at Xiling Bridge. We went ashore to visit Su Xiao's Tomb. A lone pavilion, adorned with vulgar couplets, offered nothing of interest. Next to it was Wu Song's Tomb, repaired by Tu Minshi, oval in shape and bearing a stele inscribed with the names of Huang, Zhang, and Du from Shanghai. A marker was carved on the tomb stating, "Wu Song's spirit never dies," which everyone found amusing. Further on was Qiu Jin's Tomb, a Western-style structure built ten years ago. I had often heard that Su Manshu's tomb was also located here, but despite searching everywhere, I could not find it. I asked the boatman and Banxia, but they were both bewildered and unable to answer. I lingered by the roadside, lost in thought, forgetting where I was. Banxia, Lao Lan, and others urged me to leave, so we slowly made our way to Yue Temple. Looking at my watch, it was almost 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Entering Yue Temple, I was pleased to find that the visitors had mostly dispersed as it was getting late. The guard was about to lock the gates, but after offering him two small silver dollars, he happily agreed to be our guide. In the main hall, a few candles were still burning. Passing through the hall, we entered Qizhong Shrine and reached Yue Fei's Tomb. By then, it was completely dark, and the trees rustled in the evening mist, creating a desolate and lonely atmosphere. While inspecting the iron statues of Qin Hui and his wife, Banxia jokingly remarked that Qin's wife's drooping breasts showed the beauty of ancient sculpture. Everyone chuckled. Upon exiting Yue Temple, children were hawking scented beads of various qualities, claiming they came from Taizhou, and some were even using nanmu to pass off as sandalwood. I bought a few strings; the price was very low. We then boarded the boat again and sailed from Yue Temple back to the front of Gushan. By then, the lights were ablaze, and a silvery-white full moon rose in the east. The scene on the lake became even more serene and tranquil. We proceeded slowly along the southern shore of Gushan, passing Yu Lou (Yu Quyuan's villa), and went ashore for dinner. West Lake is famous for its sweet and sour fish and water shield soup, but I found it rather mediocre. Perhaps the choice of restaurant was not ideal.</p>
<p>After dinner, we boarded the boat again and turned south, reaching Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. Under the cool moon, the candlelights illuminated the water, and the rising mist filled the lake with an ethereal light. The boats on the lake, slender as bamboo leaves, were rowed swiftly back and forth by two oarsmen like water birds. I lay back and looked at the sky, unknowingly falling asleep. Lao Lan shook me awake, and we had reached Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. As it was the Mid-Autumn Festival that evening, there were hundreds of boats, and the teahouses on the pools hung large gasoline lamps, their bright lights dimming the moonlight. The three pagodas in the pools were originally hollow structures made of stone. The locals pasted red and green paper on the stones and placed a candle inside, so from a distance, they looked like paper lanterns. Lao Lan, seeing this for the first time, insisted on touching them as a souvenir. We went ashore beside the pools, sat and drank tea for a while, but felt the night air was too chilly to bear. Banxia, slightly drunk and dizzy, also expressed a desire to return. So, we asked the boatman to take us back to the eastern shore. Far from the pools, the bustling market could no longer be heard. "Floating clouds in the eternal cold, the moon filling the boat," Banxia recited poetically. I gazed at the moon, lost in thought, savoring the beauty of West Lake.</p>
<p>European Travelogue (84)</p>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Diary of a Tour in Italy</p>
<p>(III) Ten Days in Rome (IV)</p>
<p>Day Two: The Colosseum, the Arch of Constantine, the Baths of Caracalla, and the Catacombs. On the second day, after much hesitation, we visited the Colosseum, the largest remaining building in the world and a relic of the era of Emperor Titus of Rome.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, gazing at the Colosseum, looming against the blue sky, it truly resembled a giant skull. The layers of dilapidated arches looked like the holes in a skull. Anyone who saw it would wonder why such a strange structure was built. I never imagined that the Roman Colosseum would have such a grand and austere appearance. Although it was covered in wounds, with beams broken and walls collapsed, far from its original state, recalling the history of the most cruel gladiatorial contests and the tragic deaths of Christians filled me with a chilling dread.</p>
<p>Emperor Titus built this theater, capable of holding tens of thousands of people, eighteen hundred and several decades ago. Now it has become a desolate ruin. Walking inside, hundreds of layers of mottled and broken stone steps are densely arranged, stretching to the towering peak. Looking down, many cellars are scattered below, some deep and some shallow. These were once the places where ferocious beasts were kept. I imagined the scene of lions, tigers, and other beasts leaping out of these cellars to attack people, and I involuntarily shivered.</p>
<p>Greek art did not provide the Romans with a precedent for this type of arched structure. Although the Hellenized East understood arches, they did not use them in such large buildings. The Colosseum's arches were unprecedented. The walls and arches were seamlessly connected, without any trace of division. Each arch was decorated with stone statues, giving the entire structure a sense of stability. Unfortunately, many of these carvings have now been destroyed, and the remaining ones have been moved to various museums. The Colosseum is the first large building in Rome that has been preserved to this day. This architectural method was both economical and fast. Such a large Colosseum only took ten years to build. However, this also created many shortcomings. Later architects criticized it for being merely a decorative facade, which is why it could not last for a long time. However, architects of the Renaissance also intentionally followed this path.</p>
<p>Built near the Colosseum, standing majestically among the lush green trees, is a mottled white stone arch, showing a purely Greek style of bas-relief, entering our field of vision. This is the Arch of Constantine, built by Emperor Constantine in the early fourth century after his victory over Maxence. It is the largest triumphal arch in Rome, and it became the object of worship for all artists, painters, and sculptors during the Renaissance. The composition of its bas-reliefs and the symmetry of its lines are truly the forerunners of modern painting. These seemingly difficult-to-distinguish white bas-reliefs, appearing and disappearing in the ruins, have become the only building in the history of Roman sculpture that has been admired by later generations, bearing an eternal life.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Gold Market Shows Signs of Rising Again <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Although silver bars are long, gold prices are rising again. Yesterday, the trend in the gold market was mediocre. The difference between the opening and closing prices was only about two taels. However, there was underlying upward momentum. Exchange rates, however, remain unchanged. Banks were slightly buying, but brokers in the market were not making large transactions. Only Shunli, Yuda, and hedge funds were buying. Yongfeng, Yongheng, Yifeng, and other firms were mostly selling. As for silver bars, although they are long, there are still many problems. The gold market, on the other hand, is tending towards stability. In the future, due to the differences in trading among various firms, there may be fluctuations of more than one tael, moving between 83 and 84 taels. Later in the day, Wanxing, Zhifeng, Yong, and other firms bought slightly, while Yuda and smaller accounts sold. However, the overall situation remained lukewarm, and there was little expectation of a short squeeze. According to industry forecasts, the price of silver bars may contract slightly this morning, or there may be no major changes.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Slightly Higher, Afternoon Closing Higher. The opening price for December gold in the morning was slightly higher by two mace, at 583.3 taels (gross price about 4 taels, plus an additional 3 taels). Silver bars rebounded by one-sixteenth. The silver price remained unchanged, but sentiment was not weak. However, after Yongheng, Yongfeng, and other firms sold, the price fell to 2.6 or 2.7 mace. Suddenly, hedge funds bought in, and Zhifeng and Yong bought back in, causing the price to rise to 84 taels. Later in the day, the price briefly reached 0.6 or 0.7 jian, then 3.3 or 3.4 mace. The Eastern Exchange remained stable. Zhengjin and Mitsui had both been buying in. The current price of 1.2625 taels per tael for December should be posted without further changing the price. At 83.8 taels, it fell back slightly by 3 or 4 mace, reaching 3.4 mace at around 9:50. However, the volume of trading in the market was small, and Sumitomo bought 1,743.75 English gold contracts for December. Citibank mutually traded 39.25 yuan in the current month. Then, Mitsui bought 1.2625 taels of spot gold in Dalian and hedged back the bill from Dalian, pushing the price up 10 points to 84.3 taels. Later in the day, Yongheng and retail investors sold, because Mitsui had sold 1,743.75 English gold contracts for January, which had now plummeted by about 2 taels. Around 10:30, the price was only 82.4 taels. After that, hedge fund bills came in, while Yifeng, Yong, and retail investors sold. Therefore, the price hovered around 83 taels. Foreign exchange rates showed no significant changes. After 11:00, the market seemed to improve, with supply becoming scarce. It was difficult to meet demand for larger quantities. When Da Decheng and other firms bought in, the price jumped 1.7 or 1.8 mace. As the closing time approached, the price reached 84.4 taels, then fell back slightly by 3 or 4 mace to 4 mace. At noon, the closing price was recorded as 4.3 mace, then fell again by a few qian, remaining between 4 mace. The listed price was still 619.8 taels, indicating a premium of 36 taels.</p>
<p>Bills were lacking and hedging was more active. The closing price for the afternoon was 84 taels, with fluctuations of 4 or 5 mace. Retail investors sold slightly. At 2:30, the price was 3.5 mace, then about 4 mace. At 3:00, sellers appeared to be active. Yuda and a certain speculator came to sell off, so the price was dragged down by one tael. At 3:20, the price was 83 taels. English gold was stable, with banks mutually trading contracts for both December and January at 1,743.75. China Bank and Citibank mutually traded 39.375 yuan for January. Subsequently, Zhifeng, Yong, and Da Decheng bought in, causing the price to rise by 7 or 8 mace to 3.7 or 3.8 mace at 4:00. The price fluctuated between 2 and 3 mace, eventually hovering around 3.5 mace. As the market closed, some short sellers slightly covered their positions, and sentiment remained firm due to the shortage of bills. The closing price at 4:30 was recorded as 84 taels, and it was subsequently quoted at 3 or 4 mace higher, recorded as 4.3 or 4 mace. Compared to the listed price from yesterday, it was up 9 mace. The maximum price for the day was 84.4 taels, and the minimum price was 82.4 taels, a difference of 2 taels. The listed price showed a discount of slightly less than 36 taels. The recorded price for November was 93 taels, for December 84 taels, and the premium was 93 taels. The morning closing price for spot goods was 3.3 mace, the afternoon closing price was 4 mace, and the afternoon closing price was also the same.</p>
<p>Trading on the market was not heavy, and transactions among firms were scattered. Shunli, Yuda, Yuanmao, Yong, and other firms were buying spot goods. Yongheng, Yongfeng, Fuchang, Yifeng, and Yong were selling. Zhifeng, Yong, Taikang, Runda, Da Decheng, Wanxing, and other firms had mixed buying and selling. In the afternoon, Zhifeng, Yong, Wanxing, and Taifengcheng bought, while Yuda, Changsheng, Yong, and retail customers sold. However, the quantities were limited. The Dalian gang bought 800 to 900 bars and sold 600 or more bars. The Guangdong gang remained quiet.</p>

Dalian sold 100,000 yuan to Sumitomo. A small number of firms settled until the daily rate, with several firms selling hundreds of thousands of yuan to Mitsui and Zhengjin.

<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the market atmosphere was extremely sluggish, with no vigor. Trading was limited to interbank transactions, and there was little demand from actual users. Whether silver or foreign currency, the market outlook was gloomy. The need for silver was declining, and the financial sector had been in a long-term slump, with interest rate subsidies being common. Therefore, there was no hope for a rise in prices. There was also little activity in auxiliary currencies, with only copper coins showing slight fluctuations.</p>

The early morning price for Guangdong small silver coins was 6 qian, 3 fen, 6 li, and 7.5 hao.

<p>The Rally in 96 Bonds Intensifies</p>
<h3 id="e236">Afternoon Closing Hits Limit Up <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in spot government bonds was very sparse, while trading in futures was more active than before. Throughout the day, buying and selling were very lively for the 19-year Consoldidated Tax Bonds and the 96 Bonds, with large transactions being made on all sides. The Disbandment and Demobilization Bonds also saw relatively good activity. As for the trends in the various bonds, buying pressure dominated in the 96 Bonds due to market rumors that they might be restructured, and bond prices rose sharply. At the afternoon close, the November contract hit the limit up of four yuan compared to the recorded price from the previous day. However, compared to the closing price from the previous day, it only rose by 3.6 yuan. The December contract rose by as much as 4.8 yuan, almost hitting the limit up. Although it fell slightly afterward, it still increased by 3.45 yuan compared to the previous day. The other bonds remained stable, with fluctuations limited to 2 or 3 jiao, except for the Disbandment futures, which rose by 7 jiao.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market was calm, showing a slight weakness due to sluggish sales of spot yarn and thick inventory. The Chaozhou gang was bearish, with no intention of short selling. However, a certain manufacturer was providing support by buying when prices fell, supporting the market. Overall, given the weak spot demand, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>The American Cotton Futures market opened lower in the morning, falling by more than 10 pounds. However, because factories bought in the market yesterday, sentiment was still firm. Prices for each month only fell by 2 or 3 qian in the first half, then rose by 6 or 7 qian, and fell again at the close. As a result, prices for each month rose or fell by 0.02, 0.05, or 0.04 yuan. The market atmosphere remained flat in the afternoon, rising by 2 or 3 qian. The total volume of trading for the day was 21,400 bales.

<h3 id="e238">Continued Quiet in the Cotton Market <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm. The American cotton market remains weak, but local sentiment remains firm. This is due to the weak supply from Hankou and the high cost of land, so people dare not recklessly sell short. The supply is tight, but factories still have no need for spot goods. In short, the overall situation is not good. Currently, the lack of goods is being used to keep prices high, but there may be changes in the future.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard: Continuing Firm</p>
<p>The Hankou standard closed slightly higher in the morning session, as American cotton prices fell again, easing market sentiment somewhat. In the second and third rounds, due to a lack of sellers, prices for various months rose by five fen to one qian and a half. In the afternoon, the situation was flat, with little fluctuation in prices for various months. The total transaction volume for the day was 50,300 dan. It was found that Dayuan sold 3,400 dan, Yichang 6,400 dan, Lichang 2,400 dan, and the remaining 1,246 dan. Shenchang bought 2,100 dan, Shenyu 2,600 dan, Rongxing 2,300 dan, and the remaining 1,470 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>Quiet Spot Sales</p>
<p>Spot cotton business remains quiet, but Indian cotton is taking the opportunity to arrive. The source is estimated to be 920 bales of Yao flower and 500 bales of Tong flower.

<p>American Cotton Continues to Fall by More Than Ten Pounds</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were weak due to a lack of major buyers, weakness on Wall Street, and profit-taking by bulls. Futures fell by 5 to 13 points, and spot goods fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 10 points, and spot goods fell by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.

<p>New York, 6th of the month: The American Cotton Receiving Office's estimate for the current year's new cotton production is 14,574,000 bales, an increase of 115,020 bales compared to the previous estimate (October 6th). The amount already ginned is 11,014,000 bales. Gebert &amp; Co.'s estimate for the current year's new cotton production is 14,750,000 bales, an increase of 150,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (October 6th).

<p>Grain and Rice Market: Rising Trend Intensifies</p>
<h3 id="e240">Top Grade Japonica Reaches 16.30 Yuan <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, fewer than ten boats arrived at Zhabei, and sales were brisk. Due to the limited supply of new japonica rice and continuous rain, sales were especially strong, and prices rose sharply by 0.60-0.70 yuan. Top grade rice reached 16.23 yuan. Thin-husked rice also followed, rising by 0.30 yuan. Customers inquired about Yangxian rice, with prices opening high at 13.80 yuan, up 0.40 yuan. The supply of Du Jian rice is gradually decreasing, with prices rising by 0.50 yuan. Top grade rice reached the 14 yuan mark. Local Xian rice prices also rose by about 0.30 yuan. Top grade rice was priced at 13.20 yuan. All day, both japonica and xian rice were eagerly purchased by various customers.</p>
<p>This caused sellers to arbitrarily increase prices, further driving up prices. Baiyuan rice also increased by 0.40-0.50 yuan, with the highest price reaching 16.50 yuan. Diao Pi (inferior) rice was also very active.</p>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai South, only six or seven boats arrived from inland areas, and business was extremely brisk. Prices for new japonica rice from Changbang continued to rise, with top grade rice opening at 15 yuan, an increase of 0.30-0.40 yuan, reflecting the shortage of top grade japonica rice in this area. Suzhou Tong japonica rice sales were quite strong, with various parties rushing to purchase it, and top grade rice reached around 14 yuan. Southern early thin-husked rice was universally rising in price. Yongshao stores, retail sales, and customer sales were all actively purchasing, and demand exceeded supply. Prices were expected to rise by 0.50 yuan, reaching as high as 15.30 yuan. The buying interest for Du Jian rice was active, and prices also tightened by 0.30 yuan, with top grade rice opening above the 13 yuan mark. The market for Yangxian rice was extremely tight, with top grade rice opening at 12.50 yuan. Bianyuan rice remained quiet, with prices gradually increasing by 0.20-0.30 yuan, opening high at 15.23 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Foreign Rice Follows Du Rice Upward <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of customer Xian rice was not high, and sales were excellent. The market did not see any improvement, and various types of machine-milled Xian rice continued to rise by 0.05-0.12 yuan. Jiangxi machine-milled early rice opened at 2,000 bags, handled by the Xiamen gang. The local market focused on foreign rice, with not much Xian rice being handled. The Tianjin gang handled over 200 bags of Hunan machine-milled Yuan rice, priced at 15 yuan. Jiangxi machine-milled early top grade rice opened at 11.25-11 yuan, and middle grade rice opened at 10.09-10.06 yuan, even more popular than top grade rice. Anqing machine-milled rice opened at 140 bags, priced at 10.055 yuan. Nanjing machine-milled rice opened at over 400 bags, priced at 10.085-10.095 yuan.</p>
<p>The inventory of foreign rice is not large, and it has been selling well for some time. However, yesterday, due to the increase in Du rice by 0.50 yuan, middle to lower grade Xian rice rose by 0.10-0.12 yuan. The local market frequently focused on rice, with a total of over 40 bags being sold at retail prices of 0 yuan and wholesale prices, priced at 10.065-10.055 yuan, also an increase of 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Flour Market Turns Favorable</p>
<h3 id="e242">Short Sellers Compete to Cover... Inland Gang Absorbs <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, market sentiment for various months was not as weak as before due to better quotations for foreign wheat, with differences of 0.20-0.30 yuan. The current month's spot goods from factories, such as standard flour, still require 0.30 yuan, and medium-grade brands also require 0.27-0.28 yuan. Mama brand, due to its particularly high quality, still opened at 0.33-0.34 yuan. Therefore, realistically speaking, standard flour has fallen to its lowest price, which is unacceptable to customers. The dissatisfaction of customers is that the factories failed to consider the usual practice of not allowing cash withdrawals, which prevented standard flour from establishing itself. Throughout the day, due to short sellers competing to cover and absorption by the inland gang, market sentiment returned to favorable. However, future gains and losses still depend on the factories' attitude. As a result, the current month increased by 0.015 yuan compared to the previous day, December increased by 0.0175 yuan, January increased by 0.025 yuan, February and March increased by 0.02, and April increased by 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Wheat Market Shows Slight Rebound <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, various months showed a firm trend. Due to better quotations for foreign wheat, with differences of 0.20-0.30 yuan, both bulls and bears were quiet. However, after the large drop, a portion of the short sellers actively covered. Furthermore, with the market falling to this level, neither bulls nor bears have a clear target to pursue. Their direction is based on the overall environment. If flour sales become more active in the future, the wheat market may show a slight rebound. As a result, the current month increased by 0.04 yuan compared to the previous day, December increased by 0.03 yuan, January and February increased by 0.04 yuan, March increased by 0.03 yuan, and April increased by 0.02 yuan. The spot wheat market for top grade goods remains quiet, while medium to lower grade transactions are still stable. Factories handled over 1,800 bags, and over 3,000 bags of Xianghe Hankou wheat remained in the hands of merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Silk and Tea: Ping Shui Big Bang, American Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American sales of Huzhou Ping Shui Big Bang were slightly active. The total city transaction was 2,166 boxes, with sales prices ranging from 35.225 to 38 taels, about 1-2 taels lower than before. Zhenmei Lucha, along with Tongfu, Tianxiang, Duder and other firms, had some buying interest, and the market showed a slight improvement. The Association had a strong interest in Qimen black tea and Gongxi green tea, but each tea market lost no less than 30 taels per dan, which Chinese tea merchants found extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Fall and are Weak</p>
<h3 id="e245">Japanese Car Sugar Continues to Open at 50,000 Bags <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from Cuba stated that the current sugar price was 1.375, a slight decrease of 0.0625 from the previous telegram. New York futures sugar rebounded again, with December priced at 1.44 and March of next year at 1.53, each rising by 0.07. May at 1.60 and September at 1.73, each rising by 0.08. Both Java futures and spot sugar prices showed no increase or decrease. The Association's raw and white sugar buying interest remained quiet, with a transaction price of 7.8 taels and limited transactions. Fine milled white sugar was at 7.85 taels. No. 20 medium white sugar was at 6.9 taels, with few buyers. Japanese sugar N mark was at 7.75 taels, J mark at 8.0375 taels, SH mark at 7.45 taels, Minghua YR mark at 7.325 taels, YT mark at 7.65 taels, YP mark at 7.925 taels, and Meiji goods at 7.9375 taels. Import and export was also slack. Factory plates: Minghua sugar continued to open at 20,000 bags, priced at 5.85 Japanese yen. Meiji sugar opened at 30,000 bags, priced at 4.6 yuan. Merchant interest remained strong. Dumping: Raw and white sugar prices fell by 0.05 yuan. Huaxinhao first sold 600 tons, priced at 5.9 yuan, and then continued to open at 200 tons at the same price. Jiecheng Foreign Firm also followed, selling 200 tons. The number of buyers was slightly scarce, and the market outlook remained weak. Huaxinhao also sold open road Wanjing at 2 taels per ton, priced at 5.4 Dutch guilders, and the market was relatively firm.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern Goods: Orchid Peanuts Inventory Dwindling Daily</p>
<h3 id="e246">Plate Price Suddenly Rises by One Taels <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Because the number of orchid peanuts shipped this time was not high, land prices have repeatedly increased. It was found that only 30 boxes were transported on the boat arriving from Xiamen the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the color and luster were still considered yellow and bright, and the quality was also average. Because the market inventory was low and the cost was high, customers were unwilling to sell immediately. Therefore, the transaction was only completed after adding 1 tael to the original price, which was notified by various firms.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Exploring the Reasons for the Plunge in the White Tung Oil Market <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Since the autumn, the white tung oil market has repeatedly fallen to the lowest price in more than a decade. The reasons are approximately three: (1) Overseas competition has led to a sharp decrease in exports. The United States is the largest importer of our country's tung oil. In the first half of this year, only 5,987,000 pounds were exported to the United States, a huge difference compared to the 46,635,000 pounds in the same period last year. Only 1,465,000 pounds were exported to Europe. (2) Because Hunan, the main tung oil producing area in our country, has had a bumper grain harvest and rice prices have plummeted, villagers who used to hoard tung seeds are now storing grain in anticipation of better prices. All tung seeds in the producing areas are being dumped on the market, and the market is flooded with spot goods. (3) Domestic sales are weak. The war in North China has just ended, and the area is devastated, so there is no possibility of development. Various gangs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang also prefer to use Hongyou because it is cheaper, leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which is why the market has plummeted.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Sinclair Lewis <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Xie Fulan</p>
<p>1930 Nobel Prize for Literature Winner</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, Reuters sent a telegram from the capital of Sweden telling us that the 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to American novelist Sinclair Lewis. The amount of this prize is a total of 6,500 British pounds, which, calculated at the current exchange rate, is worth about 120,000 Chinese dollars.</p>
<p>Sinclair Lewis is a famous satirical novelist. In his works, he categorizes Americans into many types, and once people are assessed by him, it feels undeniably accurate. Although he published a "Main Street,"</p>
<p>Relying on this later novel, he used his cruel pen to describe the psychology of small towns with subtle accuracy, thus gaining prominence in the modern literary world.</p>
<p>Following "Main Street," he published "Babbitt" in 1922. Since this book was published, it has created a new term for those who live on the track of contented success. His satirical mark on humanity, in modern American terms, is akin to blasphemy. Five years later, he published another book, "Elmer Gantry," which was tantamount to hitting the clergy head-on. Every minister and evangelist was slandered by this book with scathing criticism, but his most valuable contribution to literature may be "Arrowsmith," published in 1925.</p>
<p>This is a story about scientific effort and struggle. In this, Sinclair Lewis does not expose the follies and weaknesses of scientists, but pays a sincere tribute to their work and life. In addition, works such as "The Man Who Knew Coolidge," "Man Trap," and "Dodsworth" are also widely circulated.</p>
<p>Sinclair Lewis was born in 1885 in a small town in Minnesota, USA. He graduated from Yale University in 1907 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and worked as a reporter for a newspaper. After that, he successively accepted invitations from "New Haven Journal &amp; Courier," "San Francisco's Bulletin," and the Associated Press to take on this type of work. Later, he became an assistant editor of "Transatlantic Tales, Volta Roman Frederick A' Stokes Co. Adventure Publisher's Syndicate" and an editor of "George H. Doran Co." His first novel was published in 1914, titled "Our Mr. Wrenn." In addition, he also served as a selector for many short story magazines. He wrote a play titled "Hobohemia," which was published in New York in 1919.</p>
<p>Sinclair Lewis's works are most widely circulated among Americans today, and of course, there are also the most people discussing him.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Random Notes on the German Theater Scene <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Reinhardt Today</p>
<p>Anyone who has studied the art of the stage is probably familiar with the name of this master. In modern drama, Appia and Gordon Craig, along with him, have indeed left great achievements, but what is this master currently engaged in?</p>
<p>Since resigning from the Deutsches Theater in 1922 due to operational difficulties, he has been out of the spotlight for a long time. In his luxurious villa in Charlesbrook, during this period of seeming seclusion, quietly observing the theater scene, he directed Goethe's "Stella" at the Josefstadt Theater in Vienna. This direction achieved a very memorable success in the Vienna theater scene and had a great impact on the Austrian theater scene.</p>
<p>In this "Stella," he had neither "realism in the living dead" nor the "populism" in "Tanton." He left the somber theater scene in Berlin, which represented violence and triviality, and entered Vienna, the capital that tourists still imagine to be from the 18th century. His heart was filled with the beauty of this ancient-style capital. The solidity and elegance of this newly discovered capital really attracted his heart. As a Northerner, he could not forget the beauty of the Italian-style (Carnival). Therefore, he used his Northern classical simplicity to reconcile the innocent tenderness of the Southern country, making the stage of "Stella" like a classical wind stage. The elegant mood of the Italian midsummer night expressed in his direction of "The Merchant of Venice" together made a representative performance of success in this regard. From this, one can see a transformation, which means that the emotions of his genius have been immersed in the world of Mozart's music.</p>
<p>For two years, there have been rumors that he would build a theater to realize his new ambitions. After some twists and turns, he did realize the construction of this theater. On the day of its completion, State Chancellor Marx and Foreign Minister Storerzeman were welcomed in the boxes. The theater opened on this day.</p>
<p>Reinhardt intended for his theater to revive the form of the 18th-century social theater. He wanted to make the theater he presided over a beautiful, ideal, new social theater in Berlin. The special boxes inside the theater had lightning-like rose-colored tubular electric lights embedded in the ceiling, and the corridors were covered in bright red velvet carpets. The theater was very small overall, with a total capacity of only 500 people, 300 in the middle and 200 in the surrounding two-story boxes. The architect who designed it was the famous Oscar Kaufmann, who had built six small theaters in Berlin.</p>
<p>The entire design of this theater followed Reinhardt's ideas. The most distinctive feature was the small boxes that achieved the purpose of a social theater. The velvet curtains, stage curtains, and chair colors inside the theater were all bright red. They were as thin as the color of grass, and when exposed to electric light, they seemed to turn white. The upper and lower parts formed two extremely opposite colors, creating a novel interest. Each box was a small room for only four people, with a small lounge attached outside.</p>
<p>The ceiling was painted with delicate golden patterns, with a glass lamp designed with wisteria flowers hanging in the center. The seats in the middle had only a dozen rows. The orchestra was positioned in the boxes opposite the stage. The audience watched the play from the front but listened to the music from behind or the side. These were all distinctive features that left a deep impression on people in the theater.</p>
<p>The contrasting configuration of bright colors throughout the theater was well received. The boxes, up and down, also had reddish-brown wall paintings on the thin egg-colored walls, tastefully decorated with medieval-style bear decorations and ancient-style stories (sketches) such as moonlight nocturnes and Valkyries with masks. They all carried a Viennese mood and adopted a bit of expressionist style. All of this was full of lightness and smiles, humor and elegance, which was the sentiment held by Reinhardt in his mature artistic realm.</p>
<p>Reinhardt named his theater the "Comedy Theater."</p>
<p>Reinhardt presided over this new and beautiful small theater, creating a new, light-hearted laugh and a bright and elegant atmosphere. Perhaps this is one of the most noteworthy artistic revivals in Germany after the war.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Hurricane Theater <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>The years 1920 and 1921 were the peak of the expressionist movement in German drama. Among them, the most popular play, which was sold out night after night, was the performance of Toller's "Masse Mensch" on the Berlin National Stage. The background and other performances of this play were completely expressionistic. Soon, Hauptmann's "The White Savior" was staged, and the Mexican background above also used expressionist mountains and trees with thorns. This kind of installation continued to be popular in other decorations. For example, in the summer garden "Lurapark" outside Berlin, the mountains installed in the sliding railroad area are exactly this kind of sword-like mountains with painted oil paint. Winding in the vast summer night sky like shadow puppets, they are indeed a novel and magnificent view.</p>
<p>On the streets of Berlin, there were coffee shops and cinemas with expressionist style, as well as several dance halls. Among the bookstores, there were small bookstores labeled "Hurricane." Inside, the permanent exhibition of expressionist or futurist paintings and books was very touching. Needless to say, many expressionist books were displayed in his shop windows.</p>
<p>The "Hurricane Theater" was produced by writers and calligraphers centered on this bookstore. The first performance was "Human" by Lothar Schreyer, an important figure in this school. The entire venue was full on the day of the performance, but most people were only surprised by this extremely cutting-edge expressionist drama and did not necessarily have a complete understanding.</p>
<p>This transformation of "German sorrow" is expressionism, awakening people from the "superhuman world" of individualistic struggle, shouting "Der Mensch" (humanity) to do this art movement with full social consciousness. Achieving all mature effects on the theater, the efforts of the "Hurricane Theater" in extremely cutting-edge expressionist drama should not be considered wasted. (Su) (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e271">The Bright Society of the College of Law and Politics Strives in Written Work <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Written by:</p>
<p>Most people are used to blaming young people, saying they "talk big but do nothing." On the other hand, isn't there a reason for this? Let's see how many academic groups in various schools truly express their strength in practical work. Societies and associations spring up like mushrooms after a rain, but what about the work? Apart from arguing about how to proceed during meetings, once they're over, everyone looks after their own affairs and only cares about their own fun. Some only create wall newspapers with a low-spirited interest as a business for seeking pleasure. This truly shows the lack of discipline among Chinese youth, and it is the greatest shame for us young people.</p>
<p>But now, the students of the Bright Society of the College of Law and Politics are different. They have completely reversed that morbid state, starting with the performance of practical work as a preliminary step. Originally, we had never seen or heard of any Bright Society, nor had we ever seen any of their declarations or announcements. Yet, in the midst of the vigorous formation of small groups at the College of Law and Politics, that "Bright Bi-Monthly" suddenly appeared. How could it not surprise the general student body? Moreover, among the small groups in Shanghai schools, only the "Fa Guang" of the Law Research Society of the Law College can publish such beneficial materials, as far as I know. I think the publication of this "Bright" magazine by the College of Law and Politics may not be without its contribution to the school's reputation.</p>
<p>In terms of thought, this "Bright Bi-Monthly" can still be grasped within a correct scope. In the "Opening Remarks," we know their aim and purpose in publishing this small magazine. First, they feel that the dangerous phenomenon in the current youth community is that countless passionate young people are being sacrificed, and countless passionate young people are dreaming of waking the lion and driving backwards to dig their own graves. In particular, affected by the internal wars, banditry, and the preciousness of gold and cheapness of silver, the general economic situation has shown signs of unrest. The dual panic of youth unemployment and being unable to study is expanding daily. As a result, the entire youth community, due to the instability of thought, is only taking the road of reaction, only seeing hesitation and decadence, and even falling into depravity. Therefore, they believe in this dissatisfaction and want to discuss all the issues concerning the youth themselves. Second, they feel that the current social science movement and literary movement are flowing into abnormal progress, which is extremely dangerous in reality. "We must never advocate class struggle to bring the nation to its death. Therefore, we can only strive for a nationalist literary movement, negatively resisting proletarian literature, and positively awakening national consciousness to promote the realization of nationalism and achieve the goal of national freedom and equality." The third is related to their own problems.</p>
<p>"We feel that in the huge College of Law and Politics, since the autumn semester began two months ago, there have been very few academic or literary groups or publications issued. The atmosphere is really too dull. Students who are naturally quiet have the library and self-study room as their paradise, and perhaps they don't feel the silence. Students who have found their objects of affection have parks and theaters for their wild revelry and sweet words, and perhaps they won't feel the boredom. But besides these, the general students in this not very fluid atmosphere will inevitably feel silent and bored. We want to use the weak power of this magazine to stir up the air in the entire college, hoping that after this magazine, many kinds of valuable publications will appear."</p>
<p>This is their bright attitude. They are moving forward under such bright illumination.</p>
<p>Regarding the content, they all write with a rigorous attitude. Zhu Jianbai's "Questions on the Outline of the Student Union" is based on legal principles, legal precedents, and facts to discuss the sixth provision of the student union outline promulgated by the central government: "The power organ of the student union is the general assembly of members, the representative assembly during the adjournment of the general assembly, and the executive committee during the adjournment of the representative assembly." He believes that it is not very suitable. I think this kind of text discussing regulations is very valuable. Yang Zhigang's "Opinions on Family Law" is a text dedicated to discussing academics. It elaborates on family law in great detail. This is a very long article. Chun Sen's novel "A Letter" only contains some in this issue, but in these few, it seems to be too sentimental. His preface says that this letter belongs to one of his friends. This is perhaps true, because I think Chun Sen will never write such sentimental texts again. This article probably describes the story of a pair of lovers struggling under the old etiquette. I hope that the following can be slightly inclined towards the struggle of will. In addition, there are Zhu Airen's poem "Youth of the Era" and Han Bin's "Rogue and Bookworm," and Wan Bang's "Marriage and Love," etc., are all worth discussing. Gradually improving, it is truly a powerful publication.</p>
<p>After the publication, they immediately distributed it to various faculty members and students, and it was well-received by the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e272">The Guanghua Literary Society <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Written by:</p>
<p>The Guanghua Literary Society is a group that studies literature. Membership is not limited to students of any department or major. Anyone who is interested in new literature can join.</p>
<p>The first general meeting of the semester was held shortly after the start of the semester. Although there were only forty or fifty members, the spirit was exceptionally vibrant. They all hoped to do some small work together this semester and no longer be as silent and unknown as the literary society of the past.</p>
<p>The society adopts a committee system, divided into seven departments: chairman, secretary, accounting, library, speech, general affairs, and editing.</p>
<p>The work of the library department is as follows: On the one hand, it collects borrowed books from members, numbers them, and issues a book catalog for members to borrow. On the other hand, it arranges a classroom called the research room for members to read.</p>
<p>The speech department is purely for inviting literary figures to give lectures at the school to enhance the knowledge of members. Initially, it was set at once every two weeks, and Mr. Zhu Yingpeng and Mr. Zhao Jingshen were invited to give lectures. However, members have a particularly high interest in listening to lectures, so it will be changed to once a week in the future, which will be more beneficial for enhancing knowledge.</p>
<p>The work of the editorial department is as follows: It publishes a wall newspaper in the school once a week, publishing some short works and reporting the news of the society's progress. Outside the school, it will publish a monthly magazine and series of books. The supply and arrangement of those manuscripts are probably the responsibility of the members. The monthly magazine is in contact with various bookstores, so it cannot be carried out immediately. As for the series of books, that is not a matter of overnight. As long as members have collections of works, they will be included in the series for publication. According to the latest news, a poetry selection will be published. If members have good works, they can submit them. It is expected to be published during the winter vacation. The deadline for submissions is the end of November.</p>

<p>A contribution from the Shanghai office of the Liuhegou Coal Mine Company states that contemporary art giants Sun Changhuang and Gong Youzhen, in view of the needs of the times, have organized a large-scale Shanghai Applied Art Society, setting up three groups: commercial patterns, industrial patterns, and decorative design. For example, trademarks, advertisements and other patterns, storefronts and showcase decorations, dyeing, weaving, ceramics, furniture and printing patterns, residential clothing accessories design, and film, drama, photography and other scene settings, all modern life applied art matters will be complete. As for the industrial and commercial circles, there are even more contributions. The society is located at 66 Sichuan Road, second floor.</p>
<p>The Hanli Company declared that the United States lacked Chinese printing houses, and the printing industry was controlled by foreigners at very high prices. Overseas Chinese documents mostly used Japanese mimeographs, but the printed words were blurry and irreplaceable. At the National Goods Exhibition held by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco, the company sent several Zhongling printing machines for display, and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Deng Zuyin, tested and promoted them. Overseas Chinese in the United States visited the machine with great results. The printed words were simple, clear, and suitable for printing both Chinese and Western characters. At the same time, more than 200 companies placed orders. Now, the Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed to order 300 printing machines. At the same time, the managers of Saigon, Batavia, and the Philippines have also come to purchase machines. The company is in great demand and the inventory is not much. It is working day and night to add to the manufacturing.</p>
<p>Jiufutang, located on Zhejiang Road and Dai Gou Bridge, declares that the company's silk satin, calligraphy screens, and couplets are at great discounts and with great gifts. Silk banners start at two yuan or more, and a pair of real silk stockings is given as a gift for purchasing a festive banner for four yuan or more. Recently, there have been many weddings, and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically placing orders.</p>
<p>The Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Road is holding a grand sale for the second anniversary of the completion of its new building. The discounts on various goods are very low, and the gifts are very common. It is said that the first and second prize winners are heard of every day, and it is difficult to count the winners of other prizes. As a result, customers are like clouds, and the business is booming.</p>
<p>Guanshengyuan Food Company, located on South Sixth Road, declares that the restaurant department on the upper floor of the company's main store has recently agreed with Xiaoguanyuan in Jiangwan to sell various famous chrysanthemums, with no fewer than five or six hundred varieties. The department has specially used wooden frames to pile up chrysanthemums into mountains, with colorful and fragrant aromas filling the seat. Being in it is like being in a sea of fragrances. In order to meet the occasion, the department has specially sent a commissioner to search for a large number of authentic hairy crabs in the Yangcheng Lake area for all walks of life to come and hold crabs and admire chrysanthemums. In the past two days, the sales of both crabs and chrysanthemums have been very prosperous.</p>

<p>The Xifan Film Company declares that the second collection of the company's great production, Golden Rooster Ridge, is Blood Splattered on Golden Rooster Ridge, which is the proud work of the famous director Hu Zongli, starring the martial arts female star Wang Feijuan. This film was previewed last night and the results were better than the first collection. Ms. Wang also has amazing performances in the film. The drama was adapted by Ren Jinpin from Qing Dynasty sword fairy martial arts stories, and the plot is tortuous and interesting. The photography also has the latest contributions, which can fully exhaust the magic of illusion.</p>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater declares that the latest production of the Niaofa Company, Hell on Earth, will be screened at the theater today. The film stars the female lead of Floating Earth, Camiran; the male lead of Lustful Sea and Passionate Sky, Flori Hsu; and the male lead of Prodigal Son's History, Warwick Huai. Not only is the plot tortuous and the performance profound, but the meaning is also alarming and thought-provoking. It is truly a masterpiece that contributes to the world. The interpolations, such as the grasshopper dancing and the ants working, are especially novel spectacles on the screen.</p>
<p>The Audian Company declares that since the appearance of The Love Parade, there is no one who does not know the peerless beauty McDonald. McDonald was a stage actress who was famous for her singing, and her beauty was especially loved by the world. Therefore, she had already become famous in stage plays and was called a peerless talent. Only the film audience did not know her, so they were indifferent and did not pay attention. After the advent of sound films, the great director Lubitsch used his intelligence and directed The Love Parade with all his heart, using McDonald as the female lead of the film. Thus, this unparalleled beauty jumped to become a film star. The film was completed with the beautiful singing voice, the brilliant appearance, the supple body, the elegant demeanor, the profound performance, and the alluring beauty. It was admired by audiences all over the world, and almost everyone wanted to worship her. She became the great screen lover in the dreams of men. Now, her starring role in "Let's Go Native" has come to Shanghai and has been purchased by the company at a high price. It is scheduled to be screened at the company's newly established Xinguang Grand Theater. The film's vivid depictions and wonderful plots tell a tortuous story and showcase beautiful scenes. Everything is unusual, and the deep meaning and taste are especially unique. The comedy performances, the wonderful dances, and the clear and beautiful songs are not comparable to other sound films. It is expected that when this film is screened at the Xinguang Grand Theater, McDonald's name will become even more prominent.</p>
<p>The Zhabei Qingyun Road Corner World Grand Theater declares that the theater will change to the Shangwu fighting machine film Black Knight starting today. The film is the latest production of the Jinan Film Company, starring Ye Juanjuan, Huang Yunzhen, and others. It takes chivalry as the warp and love as the weft, and the performances of the actors all match the plot. It is the most valuable masterpiece produced by the company.</p>
