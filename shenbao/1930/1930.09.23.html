<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之預算難</h3>
<p>日本政府對於倫敦海約之難關。雖已過去。而對於新預算案之編成。則又甚難者。此其故雖由於商業不振。稅收之减少。官營事業之銳减。而其原因仍亦由於倫敦海約之被人反對。因倫敦海約被人反對。而政府乃不能不自認於國防有缺陷。因自認於國防有缺陷。乃不能不謀補救。因國防謀補救。乃不能不於海軍上所縮减之費用。仍用之於軍備。旣不因之而减稅。更何能因歲入不足。從而加稅。此日本新預算之難以編成。仍由於倫敦海約。被人反對之故也。</p>
<p>是故一國中而有兩種勢力。可以左右國是者。其結果必至使國事陷於進退維谷之勢。因一至於難之時。必多方遷就。以求一時之得以過去。而不知此暫時過去。日後之爲難依然仍在。如患病然。由甲部而移諸乙部。由當時而延諸他日而已。其之病在其身。一也。</p>

<p>甲女　我常聽你說對於密司脫。並無情感。有時且還討厭他。</p>
<p>乙女是啊。我當眞如此。</p>
<p>甲女但你怎麽肯嫁給他呢。</p>
<p>乙女那一天大雷雨時。我們一同在野外走。他帶着傘。我郤没有帶。他趁此求婚。我倘不答應他。他就不給我撑傘。而我那一件新花絨的旗袍不免要犧牲了。所以只得答應了他。</p>
<p>求助者太太你可能帮一下忙。給我三角錢。使我們一家骨肉圑聚麽。</p>
<p>慈善的太太（給了他三角錢）可憐的人。這三角錢的好事。當然是好商量的。但你家裏的人可流落在那裏啊。</p>

<h3>譚延闓遊西樵山軼聞</h3>
<p>— 李慶多</p>
<p>西樵山在廣東南海縣。離廣州百餘里風景甲於全省。前有東江。後臨官山。形勢壯麗。重巒疊嶺。崇峻千仞。山巓平坦。高人隱士多卜居於此。村落井然。耕樵漁收。悉如平地。不啻世外桃源。山上有七十二峯。下有白雲洞。循洞而入。雲泉仙館在焉。館之前。爲應潮湖。離湖數武爲三湖書院。及其他亭閣。茂林修竹。幽雅絶俗。國府行政院長譚組庵氏。　時在粵。慕此山之勝。乃偕同幕僚數人。由省垣雇輪往游。高登峯巒。遠眺江海。皆歎爲大觀。山麓有瀑布。清泉自山巓淙淙。向下傾濺。如白銀瀉地。名爲曲水流觴。游者至前。仰對飛流千尺。清芬之氣。盡滌塵襟。譚氏悉皆領略無遺。盤桓數日。始興盡言歸。雪泥鴻爪。此山從此又多一勝蹟。其名當益著。與粵省府主席陳銘樞氏不時賞玩之廣州東郊白雲山。適可相映成趣。然西樵勝景。猶過白雲。此譚氏所以樂於登臨也。近聞譚氏微疾纏擾。健步稍遜於前。未悉尚有登山之閒情逸致否耳。</p>
<h3>幻廬見佛記</h3>
<p>— 氷心</p>
<p>秋雨初過。斗室晨寂。吾友沈子幻廬來訪。坐甫定。即曰締交經歲。猶未一過吾廬。已囑山荆略備盤餐。屈君作半日聚可乎。余欣然應諾。問有他客否。曰滬居湫隘。不能容多客。且邀客亦不易也。乃驅車至滬南。里居偏僻。無塵囂氣。扣門入室。迎面見一佛像。朱衣跌坐。低眉合掌。繪法古拙。有玉壺筆意。上懸短額曰幻廬。諦視之。書畫皆幻廬所作。而佛即幻廬小影也。幻廬别署曰釋伽尊者。今始知其命意。夫人呂石儔女士。挈二子出見。以龍井茶虎爪筍餉客。幻廬呼其長公子令獻技公子甫七齡。竟握拳透爪。作猴拳單打式。活潑矯捷。頗有可觀。余大驚異。旋布席入座。小飲即進膳。肴饌不多。味皆清腴。而白　墩鷄。荷葉包肉尤美。飯後啜苦茗。引入東廂圖書滿架。彛鼎爛斑。幾不知身在蜃市。幻廬乃出其所藏字畫金石。飽我眼福。尚有册頁一種。庋書架上。余請一讀。幻廬曰。是不足觀。石儔夫人亦爲之齒粲。余好奇。强自取之。絹本工筆。都十二頁。頁頁皆佛。即頁頁皆幻廬。或華服作頤指氣使狀。或搖膝作郊寒島　狀。或盛衣冠。乘金根車。而導從之人。蟻聚雲屯。或貌蓬垢坐破廟外。而簞瓢在旁。衣鶉捫　。其尤奇者。忽幻出崑劇中跪池一齣。夫人飾季常而幻廬作獅吼態也余笑曰。夫人清艷。辱爲季常不稱。君美如城北。亦不似河東之悍。或者閨中影事。適成反比例耶。皆軒渠不已。其末頁則天空一輪皓月。白雲拱之。别無色相。余合十曰。一切窮通顯晦。貪嗔痴愛。胥歸寂滅。幻廬果佛化身。果是釋伽尊者。入世度人。其長公子儳言。謂爺尚能打少林拳。幻廬喝之止。然午前雛鳳之舞。固已知幻廬好身手矣。日晡辭歸。瞑想移時。作幻廬見佛記。</p>
<h3>游艇半日記</h3>
<p>— 林志鵬</p>
<p>自余來滬上。垂兹十年矣。足之所履。身之所臨。宜可以歷其大觀。然且孤陋不如鄉里之人。蓋余性好靜。凡劇塲歌館紛華綺靡之區。人所樂趨者。皆甚厭之。且少時負笈讀書。課務冗繁。不能游。稍長習商賈。困於錙銖之事。不獲游。及今歲改入上海墾業銀行。公務之繁。倍甚於前。雖有星期一日之暇。而公私叢脞。蝟於一身。故益不寗息而不遑游已。九月某日。中華圖畫雜誌第二期將次出版。王君大佛創爲水上宣傳之舉。擬於所置麥墾船上。張布額一。上書中華圖畫雜誌第二期某日出版。以船南向至董家渡。北上楊樹浦一帶。往來濱浦徐行。使兩岸觀者皆可望見。議定。由陳君鶴卿爲籌備。四明書家袁明山先生書額。皆竣。王君招余語曰。事雖爲中華宣傳。余等亦可作半日游乎。余喜諾之。時王君母太夫人方來滬。其夫人産已彌月。亦挈其子女傭僕與偕。陳君鶴卿亦至。王君乃携攝影機一。琴二。花數瓶。水電池一。小電燈泡無數。命庖人具果品食物。治酒肴。隨往游。一行十餘人。乘汽車先後出發。至舢舨廠機船處。遙見布額高懸艙上。字大如斗。筆力蒼勁。中華圖畫雜誌數字。臨風飄飄。若將凌天空而周海内者。麥墾船大可容數十人首尾長約三丈許。廣幾盈丈。艙前圍短欄。鋪錦氈。可恣游眺。中艙設几椅。緣梯而下。有小門可通。門旁置槍架。可司守衛。内設庖廚浴室厠所寢具之屬皆備。上貫電線。以小電泡綴之。通以電流。一船皆明。旁舷闢小窗。以瓶花懸之。船動時掩映生姿。下午二時解維。穿白渡橋。其上方經電車。軌聲隆隆。於橋下聽之。如萬雷齊發。至外灘公園旁稍停。即出浦行。於時秋風甚厲。江流洶湧。巨浪衝擊船身。震盪大作。王母及夫人等均出前艙。觀浦中風帆出没。艙内坐者。惟王君陳君及余三人而已。於是或調絲竹。或奏鳴琴。憑舷而眺。引吭而歌。與船外濤聲如相應和。於艙中窺外灘房屋。列次櫛比。如岡嶺起伏。屏立環抱。其海關。匯豐。沙遜諸厦。高齊入雲。又如奇峯拔起。壁立千尋。自疑此身。固在山水間。余謂滬上地值日貴。重樓疊屋。緇塵若霧。苟得與二三子常居此船。嘯歌海上。我將願終。此老矣。相與拊掌。時船已在和平神像下。江中浪濤益巨。逆流益急。船身徘徊。幾不能進。乃於旁岸稍泊。聞海關大鐘已報四下。此去董家渡尚遠。恐時已晏不欲復往。遂命船夫返棹。庖人已出杯盤。陳酒肴。以其半分前艙。三人置酒相對。且談且飲。不覺又止公園旁。一輪玉盤。隱上浦右。隔船炊烟。繚繞四起。旁岸燈火齊明。倒映水中。若貫珠然。蓋已日之夕矣。王君乃出前艙攝晚景數幅。將爲中華取材之處。並爲諸人留影畢。命船駛泊原處。遂歸。計是日船之所經。不及預定征程之半。而岸上過者。望見此船。莫不駐足而觀。於中華宣傳之責。可謂能盡之矣。余等因此而得江上半日之游。雖未能歴五湖。浮滄海。脫身市塵之外。蓋亦悠然遠矣余又安得泛浮生之舟。常游天地之蒼茫耶。</p>
<h3>聆陳德霖唱片</h3>
<p>— 菊花</p>
<p>青衣當年之好角。如胡喜祿時小福余紫雲等。余生也晚。均未及見。陳德霖則常聆之。其腔之圓潤。如鶯囀上林。鸝鳴翠柳。不必聽其字。即聽其聲。亦足以解愠滌慮。蓋得中和之聲也。絲不如竹。竹不如肉。信然。自此而後。青衣一變。變化固爲進步之階。而原板原拓之足以證明其變化之跡者。彌覺可貴。今陳德霖死矣。祇可於戲片聆之。昨聆高亭公司唱片陳唱之孝感天。彩樓配。孝義節。虹霓關各片。先正典型。不同凡響。哀怨清新。各有其妙。配以孫老元之胡琴。可稱雙絶。孫年已古稀。爲胡琴内行第一。其琴音之清剛嘹喨。人所難及。在片中聽之。恰似鸞笙鳳管。和鳴鏘鏘。其技神矣。陳唱四劇。以虹霓關。彩樓配最佳。胡琴亦然。極精品也。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（五六）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>吾又屢見甲龜爬于乙龜之背上。而乙龜或承認或否。有時乙龜避匿。大致爲雄求雌性之運動。亦無第三者之妬忌。猶之余居太原博物館觀鴿羣數千。余觀察至數矣。其雌雄間甲乙鴿在一羣中行配對。餘鴿在旁。如無知覺也者。何嘗若倮蟲爭風相殺之厲哉。由此以觀。龜子飲食雌雄間之寡欲不爭。無怪乎其爲東方易哲學大師也。</p>
<p>讀者或疑吾此言瑣屑者。乃大錯誤。吾希望讀者凝心考查一切動物爭鬬之條理。來爲人社會借鏡。取其宜者師之。而避其不宜者。昔逹爾文五年航海。結果由其報告。定物競生存之說。以造成今日世界大亂。四十年來乃得俄克魯海金動物同類互助生存說。以救濟之。而克氏乃用甚久之功。遊歴亞東蒙古以至東三省。觀察各動物社會。結果得友人俄彼得堡大學敎務長動物學者。克司勒氏互助說。ProfessorthewellknowzoologistdeanofthestpetersbergUniversity乃同開始反對逹氏觀察之錯誤。由此乃創造互助說。以開人性向善之新紀元。故知世界生殺之機。其機甚微。實關乎一二學者之研究與推斷。則學者可不愼乎。故我觀察動物多矣。即注意其鬬性條理一點。爲甚重要也。</p>
<p>博物家柯定礎君謂余曰。本草動物門有腽肭獸（即海狗腎之海狗）者。其臍人樂甚貴。此物雄性鬬爭極烈。如有一百腽肭獸。一雄者必盡殺其九十九雄者。而盡占据其一百雌者。此言果不虚。可證明一切戰爭罪惡根本。本自雄性生理而出。而今一般雄性之互殺。諉罪階級爭鬬云云。乃非其實矣。只是雄性狂暴本性之表現耳。夫治病者必拔其本。不求制止戰殺來源。而欲以殺止殺。無有是處。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二八三）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>從來太太們。對於發現老爺在外面討了人以後。第一個政策。就是設法把外面討了的那個人。搬到自已家裏來。倘然那件事辦得到。伊的工作。可以算成功了一半。有種太太們。知道老爺外面有了小房子。率領僕婦丫頭頭。浩浩蕩蕩。殺奔前去。大演其打出手。上海灘上。那也是很多的。但這種近於無智識。而且是下陷級的太太們幹的事。那種踉蹌粗暴的工作。在敵方固然是坍了台。在自已也不見得有什麽威風。武力解决的事情。那裏抵得過文化侵略。所以賢明的太太們。不取那種手段的。第一步便是耍誘之使來。好似專制國的君主。對於武臣。寗可崇其官階。不讓他專閫在外。伊想到他們的小房子。不知恙樣的窩心。也許有的地方。小公館比了大公館。還要闊綽。甚而至於汽車夫男女傭人。也呼伊爲太太。名器不可以假人。天無二日。民無二王。這如何死得。但是他們在小公館裏耀武揚威。我們如何知道。抓又抓不着。搭又搭不彀。想着了也有些難過。這又有什麽辦法呢。難道自已可以降尊紓貴。天天到他們小房子裏去嗎。倘然在耳目切近之地。可以實行監察。便是自已不能監察。自已的部下。也可以代行監察。使他們也不敢放肆了。因此章乙青的那個女人。就用此計。章乙青覺得外面討了人。已經有點對不佳伊。伊現在提出這個要求。似乎再不能不答應了。便說旣然如此。我們便商量把小房子取消。搬回來住。原來章乙青也漸漸覺得兩面奔波。非常忙碌。把外面應酬的空工夫也没有了。把他們兩人併了宅。自已又可以騰工夫來應酬。到了翠筠那裏。就把這話說了。歌功頌德。又說得那邊如何如何的好。翠筠起初當然有點不愿意搬回去。可是當人家姨太太的另有一種心理。伊以爲在外面借小房子的配偶。好像是一種私窠子。又好像是外交圑體不曾承認的政府。尤其是瞞了家裏的。不能正式披露。儘管關門做皇帝。自已的用人。太太奶奶儘管呌得應天俗響。可是出不得相。終究像一個姘頭。到了大公館裏去。雖然是姨太太。可是名正言順。總長是總長。次長是次長。好似出了官。不用那們躱躱藏藏了。旣然那邊如此賢惠。做人家的妾。也只好屈就點吧。</p>

<h3>關於印象畫派先驅辟沙羅百年祭</h3>
<p>— 陳德明</p>
<p>今年是印象畫派先驅辟沙羅（CamillePissaro生於一八三○年）的百歲誕辰法國洛羅揑里美術館（MuseeLOrangerie附屬於魯佛美術館）特爲之舉行百年祭現代法國藝術批評大家戴白朗（Tabarant）編輯紀念刋物在他所作的引言中說這個舉動是法國政府第一次正式對印象主義所表示的敬禮對於辟沙羅個人則爲國家的封謚</p>
<p>法國政府對於辟沙羅表示這樣隆重的敬禮是十二分應當的辟沙羅是那一圑印象派戰士中年紀最長享名最晚而在某幾點上面是他們之中最偉大的人物辟沙羅的所以晚成正是因爲他有幾個使仰特别偉大之點這幾點就是深刻單純和不喜誇耀他不遷就低級的趣尚和收藏家的偏見一般</p>
<p>印象主義繪畫是法蘭西民族的藝術印象主義者的奮鬬是比他們之前和他們之後的種種運動都堅苦而且奮鬥的時期也最長印象主義運動是澈底地革命的它改變了繪畫的整個性質創造出法蘭西的現代藝術一八七四年第一次印象派展覽會舉行這個日子是現代藝術的誕辰這些印象主義先驅中奮鬥最苦的要算辟沙羅一八七四年那年他已輕是四十四歲此後二十年之中他無日不在凍餒中過生活而他在藝術的戰塲却是苦戰不稍懈怠二十年後他終于戰勝了一切的困難而得稍度安易的生活而且因爲生活稍爲安易了些他的藝術的園地也更拓展了開去現在我們把辟氏的藝術分下列數段來講着</p>
<p>（一）辟氏藝術的要點</p>
<p>辟沙羅的藝術的要點就是他在生命與大自然這些東西裏面找到感興這些東西的本身是遠比那默想它們或表現它們的人來得偉大換句話說就是感興的源泉比表現感興的東西爲偉大這一種態度在畫家中是不多見的而在近世的畫家中尤屬罕見但是那倒是偉大的藝術創作所必須具有的要素十七世紀荷蘭大畫家倫白蘭（Rembrandt）具有這種態度十九世紀英國畫家沙勤脫（Sargent）就因爲没有這種熊度故雖有過人之才而不能成爲超等的畫家</p>
<p>辟沙羅的感覺與内心觀察非常深刻這種深刻的感覺與内心觀察不是那種取悅於一般人的流利的畫法所能表現出來的他嚴格地把繪畫當作一個逹到目的的方法他的技巧是恰恰適合表現他的直覺的晚年他的觀察力感深他的技巧也就愈複雜而愈巧妙在印象派畫家中如果各個比較起來孟納（Monet）的畫中有一種嫵媚的韻姿能夠取悅於人可是孟納的藝術是比較淺薄不足以表現辟沙羅的深刻的思想孟納專繪光與空氣的幻變辟沙羅却比他深刻辟氏　愛物的本身物的主要特性和物的永久質素</p>
<p>印象畫家中受人歡迎最早的是孟納理由已經在上面講過此外薛士雷（Sisyl）和雷諾爾（Renoir）也相繼得名因爲他們的畫上都有一種動人的韻姿辟沙羅的藝術比較他們都素樸一時難受人們賞識可是到了一八九二年的時候風勢終究轉了他的藝術上的價值開始爲人所認識可惜他這時已經是一個六十二歲的衰老之人没有過着幾年安易的日子就謝世而去夕陽無限好祗是近黄昏正可爲辟氏詠也</p>
<p>辟沙羅又注重表觀法蘭西鄉土的情調他的幾幅傑作是畫農民的畫他親近本國鄉村中農人深深的了解他們他用寫實的眼光繪畫法蘭西的農村生活與彌勤用道德的眼光繪畫農民異趣至於他所畫的巴黎景色和生活的繪畫初亦不比他的農村生活畫弱了一些他描寫巴黎的景色具有一種眞誠柔婉的感覺他這種熱情的看法使他的作品裏面更充滿了一種靈感</p>
<p>（二）辟氏藝術發展的各時期</p>
<p>辟氏藝術的發展可分幾個時期來講</p>
<p>（一）早期　當辟沙羅初從他的誕生地荷屬西印度羣島來到巴黎的時候他深愛着風景畫大家柯祿（Corot）與寫實主義鼻祖古佩（Courbet）的影響此外他在這時期所仰慕的作家是德臘克洛亞（Delacroix）彌勒和其他屬於巴比戎派（Barbizan　Scbool）的作家這數種影響在他早期的作品中巧妙地結合着同時加上他的個性表現這些早期作品中最顯著的一點就是那種直截的精神不過這些作品尚還是一種事物的實錄不像他後期的作品乃是一種深刻的情感表現了</p>
<p>二留英時期一八七○年法國發生戰事氏遠游至英在倫敦住下了從事繪畫佛像孟納一樣受了英國風景畫大家透納（Turner）與康斯台博（Constable）的影響從這時起他的畫面呈了一種澄明清朗之氣同時他的技巧也漸漸改變因爲他那種新的色感需要一種新的方法來表現着在這時期之中他替他的小兒女們畫了許多肖像這些肖像畫裏面顯出一種異常敏銳的感覺而表現的方法適足以把這種感覺曲曲傳出</p>
<p>（三）描寫市場景色的時期從一八八二年起辟沙羅開始描寫市塲景色市塲景色本是一般畫家所常畫的可是辟氏的描寫方法是獨出的他那些市場景色畫上有一種親近（Intimite）之感這種親近之感是他一切作品的要素和特點</p>
<p>（四）點描時期　一八八八年辟氏開始嘗試點描（Pointillisme修拉Seurat和西湼克Signac兩人是純粹的點彩主義畫家）於是他的技巧就有更進一步的發展不過這單是一種發展而不是更變點彩畫法增加了他的色彩上的變化和價值不過這種方法是太機械式的不配他那種富於感應力的人格他的感覺是須直接移交到畫布畫紙上去的和他的表現之間有一種密切的關係不是用那些做作的駁雜的手續所能獲得結果的點彩畫法嘗試的效果在辟氏一八九○年的作品中最看得出來從這時候起他的作品了入最豐富最成熟的時期不過這僅是說他的觀察更深入罷了實則他各時期的作品都有極高的地位而無分軒輊也</p>
<p>（五）末期　一八九○年氏重到倫敦去繪畫兩年之後他開始製作那一串驚人的描寫第伯（Dieppe）魯昻（Roueno）勒哈佛（Le　Havre）和巴黎的城市生活的連作把那些名勝之區的街衢花園和海濱的景色描寫殆遍這串連作無論在光和空氣上面充分表現優美的情調</p>
<p>（三）辟氏藝術的影響</p>
<p>辟沙羅的堅拔底精神誠懇底態度和高超的藝術吸引了許多人去請敎和師事他後期印象派鉅子古根（Zougin）和塞尚也時常到他即裏來請益　都非常的崇拜他氏可以說是印象主義與印象主義以後的藝術中間的一條大橋</p>

<h3>野獸派的藝術</h3>
<p>— 昌溪</p>
<p>在近來各國中都幾乎把野獸派開創者畢加梭（Picasso）的名字拿來稱謂現代的法蘭西藝術雖然野獸派是二十餘年前的事但是繼承他的運動的還有新野獸派的作家所以他們在法蘭西藝術中還是佔着很重要的位置</p>
<p>今年美國紐約的近代藝術館特别出了重金去收集法國野獸派現存的二十五個畫家的作品來展覽在作品的總目上說</p>
<p>馬笛斯（Matisse）德恩（Derain）凡勒門克（Valminck）布雷苦（Braque）盧特（Rouaut）在非（Sufy）非雷色（Fiesz）是一羣勇敢軒昻光耀的朋友有熱情的表現驚人的魄力他們是第一個很重要的發見十九世紀荷蘭後期印象派畫家谷訶（Vau　Gogh）和十九世紀法國反對新印象畫派巨子古根（Paul　Gouguin）藝術之用法的而且是首先感覺到幾不能了解的後期印象派之父塞尚奈（Pane　Cezanne）的力量的一羣而且同時從中世紀的嵌鑲工玻瑙畫木刻近東的繪畫與詩尼格羅人的雕刻加卜提克的題村兒童初期的繪畫等取得了感興使他們煥蔚成爲光耀世界的藝術他們打破傳綂的習氣自然的描摹最重要的兩點是表現繪畫的目的和獨特的感情由一羣不覊的野獸的畫家造成了一個新的局面</p>
<p>但是年輕的野獸之羣的人們是到了中年結果失掉了許多勇敢而狂野的精神只有德劯和馬笛斯是繼續的向上勇進在現在我們覺得在生存中的只有半打最偉大的藝術家了德恩是充滿着生命之力智慧而勤勉繼續的在我們的眼目中認爲他是復興的大師馬留斯也同樣的具有力量在他的色度和模樣中没有一個人可以及得上他的卓越</p>
<p>這一個引言很可以把野獸派這個名家的精神表出在這次的出品中美國人却更因引言的提示而對他兩人發生狂熱的歡迎了他俩和着畢加梭同被世界認爲近代法蘭西民族繪畫中的大師新近在倫敦的德恩個人畫展開幕時愛卜（TW.　Earp）在新政治家雜誌上評論道德恩在三大大師中是少有感覺的而且幾乎可以說是少有因感覺而起的相感的憐憫的氣味他决不曾竭力的去激奮而且也是不願意他第一是對於心的控訴而不是對於神經和意識的控訴這種批評又是屬於另一方面的了</p>
<h3>勤學的雪萊</h3>
<p>雪萊是個讀書家又是用功家他差不多没有放手過書籍無論在食堂裏寢室中甚至在走路的時候</p>
<p>霍格說我還没有看見過這樣會讀書的人二十四小時中說有十六小時是在讀書的</p>
<p>雪萊在牛津大學時是個極端的無神論者他極力攻擊基督敎終于寫了一本呌做論無神論的必然的書一方面分送朋友同時也登廣告出賣</p>
<p>此種意見在當時的英國是帶着非常反抗性而一般目爲驚人的議論一八一一年三月二十五日他受了牛津大學的開除處分這也可知此書的影響了</p>
<p>他是和前記友人霍格同時被逐于學校的他一些不顧父親之激烈反對祇是向自已的所信走去（平）</p>

<h3>北行印象（二）</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>海行</p>
<p>記得在童年的夢中看見過海青碧的波濤濺起白色浪花那是因爲白日裏母親對我講了一次關於海的故事這個印象在我的記懷裏非常深刻所以去年的夏天曾幾次到吳淞去看一看海作了幾張海的油畫然而那吳淞所能看到的海實在並没有童年夢中的海那們偉大這我應該很後悔一次朋友們旅行普陀作畫我没有跟他們去</p>
<p>好了這回不是夢中了全幅的海的景色展開在我的眼底呀蒼茫地四面尋不着邊際在空的天之穹窿底下只有蒼碧的波濤滾着在波與波衝激的時候濺起碎細的白色的浪花與白沫如果不是自已所乘的海輪的機器的振響的話聽波濤相衝激浪花澈落奔流急蕩的聲音這是多們神秘而空靈的自然的加拿大呢</p>
<p>海呀我的靈魂由緊張而鬆擴地對着空虚呌喊了一聲我欲張開兩臂如果不是投入這濤浪去之後就會死的話我想將我渺小的靈魂與肉體去受一受偉大的浸洗</p>
<p>雖然空氣這樣的寒冷而海風又這樣的刺人但我總不願意回到污濁的空氣與多量的炭氣所充集的三等艙裏去可是同行的陳君却不然從上了船進到艙裏之後没有出來在甲板上散步過一次</p>
<p>水手們在忙亂着我倚在鐵欄上低下頭凝望猛濺的濤花仰起頭悵望空擴的蒼窮平着視線遠望無際的天與海的邊線這偉大而悠久的自然給予我無限神奇空靈的啓發</p>
<p>在我眼底的自然並不像英國海洋畫家所描寫的多霧的海的迷濛的景色也不如果根畫面上的熱帶的海這實在像中世紀文學作品上所描寫的海於是我想像起海盜的生活駕一葉風帆行駛於碧綠的浪濤之上或囂聚在一黑色的艦上縱横於一無涯際的大海中的浪漫的情調</p>
<p>夜色漸漸地籠入海面天空經過一次血色霞光消逝後便變成了蒼冥空氣也更清冷星星的閃爍只有顯得更渺小黑綠的浪濤上泛着灰色的泡沫機輪好像更加增了震響船身似更有力地駛進</p>
<p>海夜的冷氣呌我不得不回到艙裏來</p>
<p>由一位同艙的健談的女士我得知道北方的一個輪廓並且增加了我北行的興趣她說在哈爾濱是多們的富于異國的情調她說那裏的俄國人怎樣地可以供給你作畫的模特兒她說</p>
<p>這時陳君在用速寫簿作斯開去那邊的日本人在閙着一架留聲器唱着日本戲實在聽得討厭</p>
<p>許是起了大風否則即是這段海程的浪濤較大所以船身忽然搖蕩起來我防備要暈船作嘔便靜靜地睡去隱約地還聽得那位健談的女士的尖銳的聲音</p>
<p>朦朧中我入了夢</p>
<p>我駕着小艇蕩在碧綠的海中用一根柳枝於浪花作戲一隻海鳥的灰色的影子從帆旁掠過</p>

<h3>Tan Yankai Passed Away Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>He was participating in a horse-viewing event when he suddenly suffered a stroke. He was rushed back to his private residence but was already unable to speak. Medical treatment proved ineffective, and he passed away yesterday morning. Arrangements are being made to purchase a coffin, with the encoffining scheduled for tomorrow morning. The National Government has issued an order for a state funeral for Tan. Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin have both sent telegrams of condolence. All government organizations have been ordered to fly flags at half-mast and suspend entertainment and banquets for three days. Hu Hanmin will act as Chairman of the National Government, and Song Ziwen will act as Premier of the Executive Yuan. Tan Yankai, Acting Chairman of the National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government, passed away at 9:30 this morning due to a stroke. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Since this spring, Tan had been suffering from illness, and his spirits were very low. During meetings and speeches, he spoke very little. Many important figures in the Party and the state were concerned about Tan's poor health, but no one expected his death to come so quickly. On the morning of the 21st, Tan was still chatting and laughing with his family at his residence and even personally composed a poem with a certain staff member of the National Government. Around 1 PM, he went to Xiaoying to view horses. In addition to his guards, his daughter and son-in-law accompanied him. Upon arrival, Tan got out of the car and stood in the sunlight to watch the event. However, because he stood for a long time and was exposed to the sun, he felt unwell and left the venue. He went with his entourage to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to rest. As the car passed the Central Hospital, he was still able to talk with his companions about the construction of the hospital. When they arrived at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, his companions noticed that his mouth and nose were slanted and knew that he had suffered a stroke. They immediately asked the driver to drive back to his residence on Chengxian Street. On the way, Tan was unable to speak. Upon arriving at the residence, he was carried into the room by guards. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were immediately called in for treatment, and doctors were also urgently requested from Shanghai. In the afternoon, important figures such as Tan Sun and Gu Mengyu came to the residence to inquire about his condition. Three German doctors from the Executive Yuan and other German doctors examined him. At that time, his blood pressure was found to be extremely high, exceeding 220 degrees. All agreed that bloodletting was necessary. After the surgery was performed, his blood pressure decreased slightly, but he remained unconscious. This morning (22nd), his blood pressure rose again. At that time, the doctor from Shanghai arrived and, after examination, determined that he was suffering from cerebral hemorrhage and still required bloodletting. After an injection was administered, the condition became extremely critical, and there was no way to save him. He passed away at 9:50 AM. Upon receiving the news, the National Government consulted with Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, and Gu Mengyu, the Secretary-General, after the memorial week to discuss matters related to his funeral. All agreed that Tan was a founding hero of the Party and the state, and his passing was deeply regrettable. They immediately telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report the situation. It was decided that the government would allocate 10,000 silver dollars for funeral expenses and appoint Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance; Niu Yongjian, Minister of Interior; Wei Daoming, Mayor of Nanjing; He Yaouzu, Chief of Staff of the National Government; Lü Bicheng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; and Chen Rong, Director of the Political Affairs Department, as special commissioners to prepare for the funeral. The funeral preparation office was established immediately. The government issued a commendation order and telegraphed all provinces and cities to fly flags at half-mast and suspend entertainment and banquets for three days. As for the funeral arrangements, it was decided to hold a state funeral, but a formal order would be issued only after a resolution by the highest Party authorities. After 11 AM, Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, and other important figures went to Tan's residence to express their condolences to Tan's family. The funeral preparation office has scheduled its organization for the afternoon and telegraphed Ministers Song and Niu in Shanghai to come to Nanjing. It is said that before Chiang Kai-shek returns to Nanjing, Hu Hanmin, President of the Legislative Yuan, will act as Chairman of the National Government, and Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, will temporarily act as Premier of the Executive Yuan. The State Council may make a decision on Friday. The Nanjing Municipal Government has notified all shops to fly flags at half-mast and ordered all amusement parks to suspend operations for three days. This has been implemented since this afternoon. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Nanjing National Government recently issued an order stating: "Tan Yankai, Member of the National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan, possessed profound virtue and far-reaching plans. During the Xinhai Revolution, he made significant contributions in Hunan, supporting Hubei and achieving the victory of restoration. Later, in the campaigns against Yuan Shikai and the protection of the Constitution, he upheld justice and integrity with unwavering resolve. During the years of Renxu and Guihai, he led the Hunan Army to follow Sun Yat-sen into Xiangyang. His strategies and contributions were instrumental in advancing our cause. Since the establishment of the National Government, he has been making decisions and resolving doubts day and night, contributing to overcoming difficulties and stabilizing the situation. He calmly sat in charge, and his political achievements were evident. Now that the great turmoil is gradually subsiding, the country relies on veteran statesmen. Unfortunately, his grand plans were not completed due to incurable illness. Heaven did not grant him a longer life, and the people have lost their protector and teacher. We are deeply saddened by the news of his sudden death. The Ministry of Finance is hereby ordered to allocate 10,000 silver dollars for funeral expenses and appoint Song Ziwen, Niu Yongjian, He Yaouzu, Wei Daoming, Lü Bicheng, and Chen Rong to attend to the funeral. All commendation ceremonies must be carried out with utmost honor to show the government's respect for his veteran contributions." This order. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Nanjing National Government instructed all agencies: "In order to comply with this order, Tan Yankai, Member of the National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan, passed away due to illness at 9:55 AM on the 22nd of this month. All agencies in Nanjing should fly flags at half-mast for three days starting from today, and all agencies outside Nanjing should fly flags at half-mast for three days starting from the date of receiving the telegram. All entertainment and banquets are to be suspended to express our condolences. In addition to distributing this order, you are hereby ordered to comply and instruct all subordinates to comply accordingly." This order. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>From the front lines, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Tan's family, saying: "I extend my deepest condolences upon learning of the passing of your father, Tan Yankai. It is a great misfortune for the Party and the country. Those who survive can only strive to continue his legacy and comfort his soul in heaven. I sincerely hope that you will not grieve excessively and will assist in managing the important affairs. Chiang Kai-shek." He Yingqin telegraphed: "Secretary-General Lü Bicheng of the Nanjing Executive Yuan forwarded your message. I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of your father today. The passing of such a veteran statesman is deeply mourned. In addition to dispatching Vice Minister Chen and Deputy Supervisor Zhou to pay their respects, I hereby send my condolences and wish you well." He Yingqin. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>The coffin for Tan, made of Phoebe nanmu, has been purchased in Shanghai and will be transported on the 23rd for encoffining at 3 AM on the 24th. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tan's remains will be dressed in the style of Sun Yat-sen's passing, with a blue robe and a dark blue jacket. Tang Kai, an aide of the National Government, has been dispatched to Shanghai this afternoon to purchase the coffin and travel by special train for transportation. It is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 23rd for encoffining on the evening of the 23rd or the morning of the 24th. The mourning ceremonies will be held on schedule. Before the mourning ceremonies, all funeral arrangements will be handled by the family. After the mourning ceremonies, matters relating to the commendation ceremony are of great importance and will be decided by the Central Party Headquarters. The funeral preparation office established by the National Government will be established within one or two days. Several dozen staff members from the National Government's Executive Yuan are currently at Tan's residence, handling temporary document, general affairs, and reception matters in three groups. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to those close to Tan, the seeds of his illness were sown two years ago, and the symptoms have become more apparent in the past year. Although his spirits were not strong, he became even more responsible and devoted to his duties. When Shi Yousan's troops mutinied in Pukou, a close friend from Shanghai personally came to Nanjing to advise him to go to Shanghai for recuperation. Tan angrily said that the situation was so critical, and those responsible in the central government could not leave their posts and disregard the survival of the Party and the country. People would criticize him. He would rather die in office than leave due to illness. Also, when the Communists ravaged Changsha, representatives from Hunan came to Nanjing to petition. Tan was even more emotionally affected by the tragedy in his hometown. While receiving the Hunan representatives, his hands trembled, as if containing endless pain. Throughout his life, he was skilled in calligraphy and studied the calligraphy styles of the Sanxitang copybooks and Yan Lugong's steles. The requests for his calligraphy were constant. He has two sons, the elder son, Tan Boyu, is a Doctor of Engineering from Germany and currently serves as the Dean of Academic Affairs at Tongji University. The younger son, Tan Jifu, is currently studying at Jiaotong University in Shanghai. He has three daughters, the eldest is married to Yuan Zhongyi, the others are unmarried. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>The British Minister expressed his condolences to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd regarding Tan's passing. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>The regular meeting of the Central Executive Committee scheduled for the afternoon of the 22nd was canceled due to Tan's passing. The administrative meeting on the 23rd was also canceled. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>After Tan Yankai's death, the Central National Government separately telegraphed the party headquarters and governments of various provinces and cities to fly flags at half-mast for three days starting today to express condolences. The Executive Yuan will suspend office for three days. Consuls from France and Japan personally went to Tan's residence to offer condolences. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>With the passing of Tan Yankai, Acting Chairman of the National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan, the National Government held an emergency meeting this morning and resolved: 1. Tan's funeral will be held as a state funeral; 2. Hu Hanmin will be recommended to act as Chairman of the National Government; 3. The Police Department will be ordered to fly flags at half-mast throughout Nanjing for three days to express condolences. An order was then issued to Vice Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, who was in Shanghai, to rush back to Nanjing to act as Premier of the Executive Yuan. Tan's death does not seem to have a major impact on the overall situation. (22nd Dispatch from Electric Communications Agency)</p>
<p>Tan Yankai, Premier of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, rode his horse to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum yesterday afternoon and showed no signs of abnormality. Afterwards, he went to bed due to a headache, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. Chinese and foreign doctors were called in to perform surgery, but to no avail. He passed away at 5 AM this morning due to cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 55. Tan was currently acting as Chairman of the National Government and overseeing national affairs. The National Government has not yet officially announced the mourning. His position as Premier of the Executive Yuan will be temporarily filled by Vice Premier Song Ziwen. He has been a widower for more than ten years and remained single until his death today. (22nd Dispatch from Electric Communications Agency)</p>
<p>Tan Yankai's Brief Biography: Tan Yankai, who passed away in Beijing yesterday morning, was named Zu'an and was born in Chaling, Hunan Province, during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1876 AD). He was the son of Tan Zhonglin, the Governor-General of Huguang during the Qing Dynasty. He was known for his literary talent from a young age and achieved the title of Zhuangyuan at the age of 25. Soon after, he was awarded the position of compiler in the Hanlin Academy. He then returned to his hometown to serve local public welfare. In the second year of Emperor Xuantong's reign, the Qing court established provincial assemblies in various provinces. Tan was elected as the Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly and made many achievements as a leader among famous figures. In the autumn of the Xinhai Revolution, Tan succeeded Jiao Dafeng as the Minister of Military Affairs of the Hunan Military Government. In the second year of the Republic of China, he was reassigned as the Military Governor and concurrently Provincial Governor of Hunan. In October of the following year, the Second Revolution failed. Tan resigned due to suspicion of joining the Southern forces and went to Qingdao. In the fourth year, when Yuan Shikai's imperial system issue arose, Tan strongly opposed it and returned to Shanghai. In the fifth year, after Yuan Shikai's death, Tan resumed his duties in Hunan. Two years later, Duan Qirui took office as Prime Minister and appointed Chuan Liangzuo to succeed Tan. Later, when the Jiangxi Army attacked Hunan, Chuan was forced to leave office. The Southwestern Constitutional Protection Government then appointed Tan to take charge of military and political affairs in Hunan. In the ninth year, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, and Zhang Jingyao joined forces to attack Hunan and captured Changsha and Yuezhou. Tan was forced to leave Hunan. In April of the same year, after Zhang Jingyao's defeat, Tan was ordered to resume military and political power in Hunan. In June of the eleventh year, after the First Zhili-Fengtian War, Yan Huiqing's cabinet appointed Tan as the Minister of Internal Affairs, but he declined. Messengers came repeatedly, but he remained unmoved. In the spring of the twelfth year, Tan led the Hunan Army to Guangdong to assist Sun Yat-sen in protecting the Constitution. He initially served as the Secretary-General of the Generalissimo's Office and later became the Minister of Construction. In the thirteenth year, when the Northern Expedition began, Tan led the Hunan Army into Hunan but was defeated by Zhao Hengti's army. He was then besieged by Lin Hu's army, which attacked his flank. He returned to Guangdong and continued to command the Hunan Army as the Commander-in-Chief. He was later elected as a Central Executive Committee member and Political Committee member in the First and Second National Congresses of the Kuomintang. In the fourteenth year, Chiang Kai-shek reorganized the National Revolutionary Army and reorganized the Hunan Army into the Second Army. Tan also served as the Army Commander. In July of the fifteenth year, Chiang led his troops on the Northern Expedition. Tan stayed in Guangdong as the Chairman of the Central Party Headquarters. After the Revolutionary Army gained control of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, the National Government moved to Wuhan. Tan came to Wuhan. In the winter of the fifteenth year, he attended the Nanchang Military Conference and participated in the key decisions of the Northern Expedition. Tan, along with Zhang Jingjiang and others, stayed in Nanchang to oppose the Wuhan faction. In March of the sixteenth year, he went to Wuhan to attend the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee. In that month, he was re-elected as a Standing Committee member of the Central Executive Committee, Chairman of the Political Committee, and Chairman of the Military Committee. In the same year, when the Nanjing-Wuhan split occurred, Tan stayed in Wuhan. In June, he mediated the successful cooperation between Nanjing and Wuhan. Later, in Nanjing in February of the seventeenth year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held. Tan was elected as a Standing Committee member of the Central Executive Committee, a member of the National Government, and a member of the Military Affairs Committee. When the system of the five Yuans was established, Tan served as the Premier of the Executive Yuan. When Chairman Chiang led his troops to fight against Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, Tan served as the Acting Chairman, overseeing all political affairs. He was 54 years old.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Budget Difficulties</h3>
<p>Although the Japanese government has overcome the difficulties of the London Naval Treaty, it faces even greater difficulties in formulating a new budget. Although this is due to factors such as sluggish commerce, reduced tax revenue, and sharp cuts in government-run enterprises, the underlying cause is still the opposition to the London Naval Treaty. Because of the opposition to the London Naval Treaty, the government cannot but recognize the deficiencies in national defense. Because it recognizes the deficiencies in national defense, it cannot but seek remedies. Because it seeks remedies for national defense, it cannot but use the funds reduced in the navy for military equipment. It does not reduce taxes as a result, nor can it increase taxes due to insufficient revenue. The difficulty in formulating Japan's new budget is still due to the opposition to the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>Therefore, when there are two forces within a country that can influence national policy, the result will inevitably lead the country to a difficult situation. Because when a difficulty arises, there will be many compromises in order to overcome the temporary difficulty. But they do not realize that this temporary passing will not solve the problem in the future. Like an illness, it is transferred from one part to another, from the present to the future. The disease is in the body, and it is one and the same.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 21st: German Foreign Minister Curtius delivered a speech on wireless telephone in Geneva today regarding Germany's attitude towards the League of Nations. The content of his speech reiterated the current declaration in the League of Nations Assembly, believing that although the League of Nations is not without disappointing aspects for Germans, it should occupy a complete and independent part of German foreign policy. Germany must seize every opportunity to urge it to fulfill certain obligations. Then, regarding the European Federal Plan, he stated that what Germany demands is that the current political situation in Europe should not be allowed to exist permanently, and it should be reorganized on the basis of fairness and equality. Finally, regarding the issue of disarmament, he said that although its progress is extremely slow, it has not completely stopped. The fact that British Foreign Minister Henderson and Italian representative Scialoja have publicly accepted Germany's theory of disarmament shows that there is still progress.</p>
<p>Pacific Press, Lyon, 21st: Former French Prime Minister Herriot delivered a speech on the League of Nations at a meeting of electors. He said that the principle of a European Federation has been recognized by all parties. What is unknown is whether the European Federation will be implemented economically or politically. Even in terms of economics, European countries have the same needs, but their material resources are very different, and the difficulties ahead are numerous. This is something we must not forget.</p>

<h3>International Transport Conference Opens</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Not Represented</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: The International Transport Workers' Federation conference, held every two years, opened this morning in Kirksteld. Representatives from 35 countries attended, including representatives from India and Palestine. Of the European countries, only Soviet Russia was not represented. The conference is being held in the United Kingdom for the first time since the European War. Chairman Cream Pull said in his speech that the best way to improve the working class is through internationalism rather than nationalism.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Compile New Japanese Budget</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The compilation of the government's budget this time has encountered unprecedented difficulties. Although the total amount of the estimated standard amount for the sixth year of Showa planned during the compilation of this year's actual budget was 1.572 billion yen, due to the poor financial situation, tax revenue, and official industry revenue have sharply decreased, and the expected decrease in revenue is 140 million yen. According to the Ministry of Finance's observation, the total revenue is 1.43 billion yen. The Ministry of Finance has decided to conserve established funds to compensate for this revenue reduction. However, the conservation of established funds has been distributed to various provinces in accordance with the decline in prices. The Army and Navy have requested the most conservation, but the Army and Navy often refuse the budget reduction request with strict words under the pretext of national defense. Therefore, the biggest difficulty in compiling the budget is filling the revenue reduction with budget cuts. In addition, supplementary planning and tax reduction issues are also difficult issues.</p>
<h3>Unabated Storm in the English Channel</h3>
<p>Pacific Press, Port Apul, 21st: The wind disaster in the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean is even more severe than before. According to an official report from Folkestone, England, the wind speed has reached 133 kilometers per minute. Ships currently in flight have been delayed, and ships in the port have not dared to set sail. Three large French fishing boats were blown ashore and destroyed. Ten Atlantic liners have been delayed due to avoiding the storm. Two sailors were swept away by waves.</p>
<h3>Berlin Radio Exhibition</h3>
<p>200,000 Visitors</p>
<p>Manufacturers Make Large Profits</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 21st: This year, no fewer than 200,000 people visited the radio and telephone exhibition. During last year's exhibition period, there were only 130,000 people. The public's enthusiasm for radio is far greater than before, so manufacturers have made large profits as a result of the exhibition. Most companies have not only sold out all the exhibits but also accepted large orders.</p>
<h3>Performing Flight Technology, Stertegg Dies in Accident</h3>
<p>Reuters, Yville, Belgium, 21st: Today, there were many spectators watching the performance of flight technology here. One performer, named Stertegg Jiwski, who was performing the technique of descending with an umbrella, fell to his death. Stertegg was connected to three parachutes and took off in an airplane. When he reached a height of 3,000 feet, he jumped out of the plane and fell several hundred feet. He urgently pulled the parachute rope, and the first parachute opened. Then he drifted down slowly. Stertegg then abandoned the first parachute and released the second parachute. When he descended to 1,500 feet above the ground, Stertegg abandoned the second parachute and pulled the third parachute rope. Unexpectedly, the third parachute did not open, and Stertegg fell from above to the ground and died on the spot.</p>

<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>On the 22nd at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held its 78th weekly memorial service for the late Premier at its auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Yu Jingtang, Miao Peicheng, legal advisor to the National Government, American Lin Baike, and approximately 500 staff members from various central departments and commissions. Chairman Chen Guofu presided over the ceremony, followed by a political report from Shao Yuanchong, who stated that recent military victories against rebellious forces were very successful, and the desire of various reactionary factions to expand their personal territories would soon be completely eradicated. The second step would be to focus on political construction and permanently eliminate the source of future chaos. In the past, due to the impact of military affairs, achievements in party affairs, political education, and other construction efforts had not met the expectations of the people. From the party's perspective, party members should not be a special class but should stand with the masses, constantly seeking their interests, relieving their suffering, resolving all their difficulties, and fulfilling their leadership responsibilities without any bureaucratic tendencies. Party comrades working in reactionary areas should be responsible for uniting with the people to eliminate the reaction. If elimination is impossible, they should report to the central government for disposition. Abandoning work and leaving the people is a dereliction of duty. Although the hundreds of comrades working at the Central Party Headquarters are busy, most of their work involves paperwork. Very few are engaged in activities among the people, guiding and training them. As a result, the people's faith in the party is difficult to fully establish. In the future, efforts should be concentrated on practical work so that the people's seven major movements can be led and developed. Politically, repeated rebellions have hindered the implementation of administrative affairs by the Examination and Control Yuan. Most of the national finances are used for military expenses, making it impossible to carry out various administrative tasks. Now that the rebellion is about to be quelled, there is no room for delay in internal affairs construction and officialdom rectification. Education is closely related to party and political construction. Any national construction requires qualified personnel. If there are not enough qualified personnel, construction cannot proceed. Those in charge of education should comprehensively plan based on the policies decided by the central government to adequately cultivate the number of construction talents needed by the country and society to provide an appropriate supply. The cultivation of talents for production construction is particularly urgent at present. Appropriate allocation should be sought in academic disciplines according to local conditions. For example, coastal areas can develop the benefits of fishing and salt, mountains can create forests, and plains can engage in animal husbandry. By taking advantage of local natural resources to cultivate talents suitable for these careers, there is no fear that the national economy cannot develop. Next, Lin Baike reported on his impressions of visiting Jiang at the front, saying that Commander-in-Chief Jiang is the successor to the late Premier, and his goal is to seek peace. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Attendees included Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Sun Ke, Zhang Nanxian, Wang Jiazhen, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Lühe, Qiu Ao, Li Jinlun, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, and a total of over two hundred staff members from the National Government's civil affairs and military affairs offices. Chairman Gu Yingfen presided over the ceremony, followed by a political report by Secretary Zhu Wenzhong as follows: 1. Yan Xishan's Telegram Announcing His Retirement: Last Friday, the government received telegrams from the front lines stating that Yan Xishan had announced his retirement in Shijiazhuang on the 15th because Deputy Commander Zhang from Shenyang had dispatched troops to Pingjin to support the central government. On the same day, Deputy Commander Zhang from Shenyang sent a telegram advising Yan and Feng to immediately cease hostilities and await the central government's arrangements. He also simultaneously issued a mobilization order, commanding Wang Shuchang and Yu Xuezhong to lead the First and Second Armies to approach Pingjin. Wang and Yu's troops arrived in Tianjin the day before yesterday and stationed in Peiping yesterday. The rebel forces on the Longhai and Pinghan lines have retreated northward. Wang Jingwei, Xie Chi, Zou Lu, and others have long fled Peiping in panic. All the pseudo-government's affiliated institutions and expanded meetings were closed on the 20th, and personnel fled. The reactionary forces in the north have completely collapsed. This result was expected and can be said to be a law of counter-revolutionary failure. Whoever opposes the revolution cannot escape this law. Especially this time, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's rebellion involved promoting an anti-party movement claiming party affairs should be resolved by party members and national affairs by the people, while also colluding with the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party to oppose the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, they dreamed of restoring the feudal forces of the Beiyang faction and inheriting Yuan Shikai's legitimacy, gathering the Anfu clique, the Transportation clique, the Research clique, the Political Studies clique, and the meritorious officials of the Hongxian monarchy, the remnants of the imperial system, Qi Xieyuan, Sun Chuanfang, Zhang Zongchang, etc., into a large-scale counter-revolutionary group in an attempt to resist the entire revolutionary force. They did not realize that China has undergone forty years of revolutionary baptism by the late Premier and has become an entirely Three Principles of the People-ized nation under the leadership of the Kuomintang. Those who oppose the party will fail, those who oppose the Three Principles of the People will fail, and those who oppose the revolution will fail. These three principles have become the sacred and inviolable laws of modern China. No one can escape or deny them. Moreover, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang not only opposed the party and the Three Principles of the People but also represented all counter-revolutionary forces, possessing all three counter-revolutionary qualifications. Their failure and collapse were, of course, expected and not surprising. However, it is hoped that the people of the country will take Yan and Feng's failure as a final lesson and that there will be no more Yan and Fengs in the future, no more anti-party, anti-Three Principles of the People, and counter-revolutionary events. Especially, it is hoped that the confused and misguided youth will wake up and turn back, so that China can concentrate its manpower, financial resources, and all its strength to jointly embark on the path of construction of the Three Principles of the People. 2. Deputy Commander Zhang's Dispatch of Troops to Shenyang: Deputy Commander Zhang's dispatch of troops to Pingjin on the orders of the central government was a pre-planned move. However, before Deputy Commander Zhang telegraphed his dispatch of troops, Yan and Feng and other rebels妄想設計誘惑 to fulfill their dream of becoming emperors behind closed doors. They did not realize that there is no possibility of cooperation between revolution and counter-revolution. Deputy Commander Zhang, having pledged loyalty to the party and the country, was determined to eliminate the counter-revolutionary Yan and Feng. Previously, due to environmental and procedural reasons, he could not immediately issue a mobilization order, and Yan and Feng mistakenly believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of. Now, Deputy Commander Zhang has followed the central government's orders and, with lightning speed, commanded Wang and Yu's troops to station in Pingjin, while telegraphing to advocate that all issues be resolved by the central government. This proves that Deputy Commander Zhang's heart of loyalty to the party and the country has remained consistent. All previous rumors and conspiracies have been refuted. 3. Full-Time University Presidents: Education is the lifeblood of the country, and national universities are the highest institutions of the country. The lack of specialization in the responsibilities of the president has a significant impact on the country's educational future. Recognizing this, the central government decided at its 94th State Council meeting last Friday to approve the resignations of the presidents of National Peking University, Jiaotong University, and Labor University from their concurrent positions. The president of National Sun Yat-sen University was also appointed full-time last week, with Comrade Zhu Jiahua taking over. From now on, with the specialization of the responsibilities of the presidents of each university, the planning and implementation of school affairs can be accomplished with less effort and greater results, which will naturally greatly benefit the future of education. 4. Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: On the 16th of this month, the government announced the Regulations for the Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. At its 94th State Council meeting last Friday, the government decided to appoint Zhang Qun, Li Zhonggong, and seven others as members of the National Government Reorganization Committee of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, designating Zhang Qun as chairman and appointing Li Zhonggong as a special commissioner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's General Management Office. The late Premier said that food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the four major needs of the people's livelihood. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has a history of decades in China's transportation and is an important enterprise in the four major needs of the people's livelihood. Its future success or failure is of great importance. We firmly believe that the comrades who are responsible for the reorganization this time will certainly be able to follow the late Premier's teachings, carry out the central government's intentions, and, based on the needs of China's transportation, be truly responsible and thoroughly reorganize it. Not only will the business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company prosper from now on, but they will also certainly find ways to make the domestic shipping industry adapt to the needs of water transportation in order to establish a foundation for recovering all domestic shipping rights. 5. Foreign Affairs: Recently, there are two points regarding foreign affairs that can be reported. First, regarding the Sino-British issue, the Amoy British Concession was signed and exchanged on the 17th of this month and recovered by our country. Other issues, such as the handover of Weihaiwei, the Sino-British and Sino-French rights issues, and the Boxer Indemnity issue, are also under negotiation and will soon have a satisfactory resolution. Second, the Sino-Japanese telecommunications conference has been held twice in Beijing on the 17th and 18th of this month. All issues have been discussed in detail. The third meeting is scheduled for next month. The results will certainly be in line with the principles of international equality and national sovereignty. In short, the late Premier told us that to abolish all unequal treaties, we do not need to ask what the other party will do, but first ask ourselves if we have the determination.</p>
<h3>Min Army Conquers Dehua in Campaign Against Lu</h3>
<p>Amoy Correspondence: Fang Shengtao, the special commissioner for the Minnan military campaign against Lu, originally planned to have Chen Guohui's Provincial Defense First Brigade attack Dehua first, and then use its full force to attack Datian and flank Youxi after Dehua was taken. Xu Feilong's troops under Lu's command relied on the dangerous terrain to defend stubbornly, and Chen repeatedly failed to conquer it. Fang Shengtao went to Yongchun at the end of last month to transfer the newly formed First Division's First Regiment under Wang Zuqing to join the battle. Chen Guohui's six battalions were assigned to the front, Wang's regiment to the west, and the First Division's supplement regiment under Lin Qinglong to the north, totaling about 4,000 men. Xu defended the forts and strategic passes. The attack began on the first of this month. Initially, artillery was used to destroy the positions. On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, aircraft from the Amoy Naval Aviation Department flew to Dehua daily for reconnaissance and dropped bombs. In addition to using artillery to destroy the forts, the operations also involved covering infantry charges. On the 9th, Chen Guohui occupied Caopuweizi, cutting off the traffic between Dehua City and Xu Feilong's lair, Sanban. On the same day, Lin Qinglong of the western route occupied Xidun and Moshiling, cutting off the traffic between Dehua's north gate and Jiaoxi. On the 11th, Wang Zuqing's regiment occupied Tangzhai outside the west gate and then attacked Tangzhai. By then, the key passes outside Dehua City had been lost and the city was surrounded. However, Xu still defended Tangzhai outside the north gate. On the night of the 13th, Fang Shengtao's headquarters launched a general attack on Dehua City, ordering the attack to begin at midnight and continue until about 4:00 AM. Wang Zuqing's regiment occupied Tangzhai. As a result, the remaining isolated city was defended by Xu's troops. Chen Qingru's battalion defended the west gate, Xu Feifeng defended the south gate, and Xu Feilong and his battalion commander Li Kui defended the northeast gates. After Tangzhai fell, Wang's regiment took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack. At about 5:00 AM, the fort on the Gongding of the west gate was destroyed by the First Division's artillery again. Xu's troops could not resist and rushed to break through the north gate and flee to Jiaoxi and Sanban. At 6:00 AM, Wang's regiment occupied the north gate. At 6:20 AM, the entire team entered the city. Subsequently, Chen Guohui's and Lin Qinglong's troops entered the city one after another, seizing more than 500 rifles and three cannons, capturing more than 100 prisoners, and capturing Xu's chief of staff Su Xuekui and battalion commander Chen Qingru, who were escorted to Yongchun headquarters on the same day and executed by firing squad in Yongchun on the 15th. After the fall of Dehua City, Fang Shengtao telegraphed the provincial government and various military agencies in the province to report the victory. Currently, they are searching for the remaining enemies in Dehua and will launch an attack on Datian soon. The deployment of the troops for the attack on Datian has been decided: Lin Qinglong will be the vanguard, Wang Zuqing will be on the left flank, Chen Guohui will be on the right flank, and the Second Detachment of the Teaching Regiment will be the reserve force. The First Detachment will remain in Dehua and Yongchun. The above troops will set off for Datian soon. If Liu's troops in the upper reaches capture the mouth of the river, they will attack Youxi, and Youxi, being Lu's lair, Yanping will definitely not be able to hold it either. (September 18th)</p>
<h3>New Deployment of Japanese Garrison in South Manchuria</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: According to a recent message from the Japanese Consulate in Andong, Mr. Hishikari, Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Lushun, has been ordered to come to South Manchuria to take up his post. He plans to reorganize the defense area. It has now been determined to divide it into seven areas, roughly as follows: 1. Lushun-Wanjing: Independent Garrison First Battalion, 720 infantry. 2. Wanjing-Sujiatun: Independent Garrison Second Battalion, 780 infantry. 3. Sujiatun-Pulandian: Independent Garrison Third Battalion, 600 infantry. 4. Pulandian-Andong: Independent Garrison Fourth Battalion, 600 infantry. 5. Tieling-Kaiyuan: Independent Garrison Fourth Company, 300 infantry. 6. Yingkou-Haicheng: Independent Garrison Third Company, 300 artillery. 7. Shenyang-Qianjinzai: Main force of the 14th Division Regiment, 2,000 troops. The above seven areas have a total force of 10,220 troops, and the police in the affiliated areas along the line are not included in this number. It has been found that the main goal of the Japanese in operating the South Manchuria Railway and developing Manchuria and Mongolia is to use economic strength as a precursor. Although the strength of the troops stationed along the line is limited by the treaty, they have not been able to fully deploy troops. In reality, they are sufficient to strengthen the security. However, due to the frequent transfers of all Japanese troops along the line and the constant changes in the defense area, the exact number of troops stationed is unknown. The number issued by the Japanese side is as above, which gives a glimpse. According to news from the South Manchuria Railway, the recent survey by the Kwantung Government of the total number of veterans (i.e., retired soldiers) along the South Manchuria Railway is more than 7,500. On average, all types of soldiers are available, including 63 military police, 2,500 infantry, 200 cavalry, 500 artillery, 400 engineers, 150 airmen, 1,400 supply troops, 100 quartermaster troops, 150 medical troops, 6 veterinary troops, and 10 band members. The veterans in each area are planned to be organized into a division regiment to guard the line and make up for the shortcomings of the active troops. When the training is completed in the future, in the event of an emergency, it can be summoned to one place within ten hours at the latest. (September 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Secretly Enter Xita Temple in Shenyang to Excavate Hidden Gold</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: At about 4:00 AM on the 15th of this month, four Japanese police officers, accompanied by a Japanese woman and leading more than ten Chinese laborers, suddenly arrived at the Xita Lama Temple in three heavy-duty trucks. At that time, the temple gate had not been unlocked. The Japanese police officers immediately led the Chinese laborers to jump over the wall and enter the courtyard. The Japanese police officers, holding a map in their hands, followed the map and ordered the Chinese laborers to dig under twelve stone bricks in front of the temple hall. The Japanese police officers also threatened the affairs lama in the hall with guns and forbade him to make any noise. When the lamas in the temple inquired about the situation, they learned that the Japanese police officers had come to excavate hidden gold. At that time, the words of the Japanese police officers were heard by a young lama in the back hall, who sneaked out from behind the temple to report to the Second Branch of the Commercial Port. The director of the branch, upon receiving the news, immediately reported to the headquarters by telephone and led more than ten police officers and some members of the Public Security Team to the temple to stop them. The Japanese police officers were quite tyrannical, but since the place was Chinese territory, they had no right to excavate and could not argue. They then led the workers and others to withdraw. According to the Japanese police officers, 33 years ago, during the Russo-Japanese War, a certain Russian commander, after being defeated in Shenyang, buried 40 boxes of Russian gold pounds in the temple courtyard. He drew a map. Later, the commander was captured by the Japanese army. The Japanese commander treated him favorably and married his daughter. This daughter obtained the map from the commander and came to Shenyang to request the Japanese police to excavate it. The Japanese police officers then secretly went to excavate with the Japanese woman, hoping to take advantage of the early morning hours when our police officers were unprepared to excavate and leave. However, the plan was suddenly exposed. Currently, the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau has dispatched more than 20 police officers to guard the vicinity of the temple day and night to prevent the Japanese police officers from taking the opportunity to come again. This issue has attracted much attention from all parties. However, it is still impossible to determine whether the hidden gold exists. (September 16th)</p>
<h3>East Road Electrical Rights Changed to Teleconference</h3>
<p>Both sides have the same opinion</p>
<p>But disputes are inevitable</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The electrical rights conference has been suspended for more than a month after Li Deyan returned to Liaoning for instructions. Recently, he suddenly came to Harbin again. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has received the transfer from the Board of Directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Russian Director General Yamshana夫 has allowed the three unresolved issues in the electrical rights issue, such as the amount of sovereignty fee, the inspection of outbound telegrams, and the payment for interconnection, to be openly discussed by the Chinese and Russian directors of the board in accordance with the principle of mutual rights. The Chinese and Russian members can continue to hold a conference on the telephone section. The Ministry of Communications believed that such handling was still acceptable, so it ordered Li to come to Harbin again to continue the conference. The Ministry of Communications had no proposal to submit for this conference because the operation of the telephone by the Chinese Eastern Railway was an illegal infringement. Not only is it justified for us to take it back, but it is also not excessive to find out if there is any surplus in the previous accounts that needs to be paid. Therefore, Li Deyan has indicated to the Russian side that the Russian side must first submit the proposal and hand it over to the Chinese side for review, but the Russian side wants the Chinese side to submit the proposal first and then the Russian side will add its opinions. This is just a matter of the proposal procedure and research, and it is probably not a problem. However, the real intention of the Russian side is not here. Since the telephone section is not listed in the Sino-Russian electrical rights contract, the Russian side has no basis for negotiation. However, it still intends to complicate matters and demand that the Chinese side compensate for the property cost of the Harbin automatic telephone. Therefore, in practice, the telephone issue is still unlikely to have a smooth conference. (September 17th)</p>
<h3>Banditry Rampant in the Suburbs of Harbin</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Bao Wenwei, the director of the Special Police Management Office, left Harbin for Liaoning almost a month ago. Since there is no suitable person to be responsible for the special police administration, the banditry in the suburbs has become rampant and the harassment has become more severe. A group of bandits, numbering about six or seven hundred, has gathered near Baomachuan, more than ten miles west of the port, near the upper reaches of the Songhua River. The passage of sailing vessels has also been cut off for the past ten days. The Navy's River Defense Fleet Department had no choice but to send the Jiangtong warship to suppress them. However, without the assistance of the special police, the banditry is still rampant. However, the bandits only temporarily evade when the warship goes. At Fengjiawazi, twenty miles east of the port, there is a group of bandits from Jiujiang, numbering more than four or five hundred. The place is located at the junction of Binjiang and Acheng counties, and there is no one responsible for suppression, so the bandits are becoming increasingly rampant and wreaking havoc in more than ten villages in the eastern suburbs. On the 15th of this month, a small team of bandits from the Jiujiang gang invaded Baijiawopu, about three miles outside the city, causing panic in the city. The Binjiang Garrison Commander dispatched the 11th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 61st Regiment of the 18th Brigade to suppress them. At noon on the 16th, they encountered the bandits. The 11th Company bravely pursued them. At 1:00 PM, they were lured by the bandits to Fengjiawazi. The Jiujiang gang led its entire force of bandits to meet them and trapped the soldiers of the 11th Company in the center of the encirclement. Company Commander Zhang Yuwu was shot and killed in battle. More than half of the soldiers were killed or wounded. The rest made every effort to break through and retreat back to Baijiawopu, sending people to urgently report to the Garrison Headquarters. After the Garrison Headquarters redeployed the entire 3rd Battalion to suppress them, they set off at 6:00 PM that evening and clashed with the bandits at Fengjiawazi at 8:00 PM. After a night of fierce fighting, more than ten bandits were killed, and the bandits began to flee towards Acheng County. (September 17th)</p>
<h3>Devastating Water Damage in Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The area affected by the floods in Liaoning Province this time is so wide, and the disaster is particularly severe. Previously, due to traffic disruption, the true situation was unclear, making it impossible to provide a systematic report. Now that the Emergency Flood Relief Association has been established and personnel have been dispatched to various locations for sequential investigation, the situation in the disaster areas is extremely detailed. Jin County, Suizhong, Xinmin, Panshan, Heishan, Beizhen, Yixian, Liaoyuan, and other counties have been the most severely affected. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jin County: Since August 10th, heavy rains have fallen. The water level of the Daling River, the Nuer River, and hundreds of other rivers has surged. On the 11th, the water level rose sharply, and all four gates outside the city became a flooded area. Many houses collapsed, and many people were washed away. Among the city gates, the West Gate suffered the most damage, with over three thousand houses collapsing. The water depth is still over ten feet. Over a thousand houses were destroyed in the North Gate. Most of the people here are coolies and commoners. They were suddenly hit by the flood, and not a single tile remained. They set up sheds and slept in the open, or sought shelter under willow trees or on high sandbars, barely shielding themselves from the wind and sun. On rainy days, the leaks were unbearable, making for a truly miserable sight. The water depth in the East Gate also reached ten feet, and about a thousand houses collapsed. A general investigation of the disaster situation in the county shows that Districts 6, 7, and 8 are the most severely affected, Districts 2 and 4 are less affected, and Districts 3, 5, and 9 are only lightly affected. The area affected in Districts 7 and 8 accounts for approximately one-half of the county's total area. All refugees have no clothes, no food, and no shelter. They are exposed to the wind and sun during the day and sleep in the rain and dew at night, suffering from hunger and cold. Many are sick. The corpses of humans and animals that have drowned are everywhere, and no one buries them. The stench is overwhelming. The flesh is mostly eaten by wild dogs, and the bones are scattered everywhere. There are 50,000 to 60,000 people waiting for relief. Driven by hunger, some dig up moldy sorghum from the ground, bake it, and eat it. The color is black, the taste is sour, and the smell is burnt and unpleasant. Others eat at the porridge pots set up by various institutions (there are twenty-five porridge pots in the county's urban and rural areas). Their faces are pale and they look like they haven't eaten vegetables, and they are led by the old and accompanied by the young. The situation is extremely pitiful. The most tragic situation is in the southeastern part of District 7 and the southern part of District 8, where fertile fields have been covered by white sand and completely filled the riverbed. The landowners' decades of hard work have been washed away by the sand. When they talk to people about it, tears stream down their faces.</p>
<p>Suizhong County: The Liugu River in the east and the Wangbao River and the Heishui River in the west experienced flash floods from upstream mountains on August 4th. The river water rose sharply and entered the city in an instant, reaching a depth of ten feet. By dawn on the 5th, the water level had receded slightly. On the 6th, it began to recede gradually. An investigation revealed that only the county government street and the area around the Drum Tower, about half a square mile in area, were spared from the flood due to the higher terrain. The rest of the houses were destroyed, and men and women were washed away. In the urban and rural areas, about three thousand households of merchants and residents were affected, and about two thousand people died. Over thirty-seven thousand houses collapsed, and over ten thousand market houses collapsed. As for the four townships, Districts 7 and 8 are located upstream of the river, and Districts 1, 2, and 3 are located downstream of the river. The damage they suffered was even worse than that of the urban and rural areas. In total, more than half of the seventy-plus villages in the county, over thirty villages, were completely destroyed, with all houses and people gone. The affected area is about forty to fifty li wide from east to west and about one hundred li long from north to south. Currently, corpses are piled up along the roads in the city's four gates, in narrow places and near the Xiangfang Village and Hanjia Wazi Village, etc. The air is filled with a foul odor. The surviving refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, with pale faces, wander along the roads, their cries of grief echoing everywhere, making for a truly unbearable sight.</p>
<p>Xinmin: This year, the county has experienced a total of four major floods. The most severely affected areas are Districts 1, 4, 5, and 6, covering an area of 150,000 to 160,000 mu. There are over 60,000 refugees (including over 40,000 able-bodied men and over 20,000 women and children). This flood was caused by flash floods in Mama Mountain and Gaotaizi Mountain in Rehe Fuxin County. The water rushed straight down, and the tide head was over ten feet high. Whatever was in its path was swept away. The water washed away a very thick layer of white sand, accumulating to a depth of several feet or even ten feet. Even the tall willows within the area, over ten feet high, were buried, with only the treetops exposed. All the houses were either level with the ground or completely buried. The fields were covered with sand to a depth of seven or eight feet or more. It will be impossible to cultivate them again in the future, and they have become barren land. Now, many of the wealthier people have been affected by the disaster and have sought refuge with relatives and friends in other places. Those who are poor and have nowhere to go, or who are attached to their remaining houses, are finding it difficult to get enough to eat each day, waiting for relief with empty stomachs.</p>
<p>Panshan: Panshan County consists of eight districts. Only District 3, near Shaling, was spared from the flood due to the construction of over twenty li of earth dikes. The remaining districts were flooded one after another due to continuous heavy rains from August 4th to 8th, causing the Daling River, Raoyang River, Gan River, Yu River, etc. to overflow. In addition, the water from Zijing Mountain washed down, collapsing houses and washing away livestock. The sorghum and beans were all submerged, making it impossible to harvest a single grain. The exact number of people who died is still unknown. Currently, 100,000 disaster victims are seeking food from wealthy households and in the county town, crying and begging, their situation extremely tragic. The water has not yet receded. The people in each district are lying on rooftops and in trees, holding on for dear life. The Emergency Relief Association is allocating and hiring boats every day to transport grain and distribute it, so that they can barely survive.</p>
<p>Heishan: After the flood, it was difficult to travel by boat in deep water and by people and horses in shallow water, making the investigation extremely difficult. According to the county's general report on the disaster situation, twenty-eight villages in the first district were flooded, submerging over 8,000 mu of land and 5,600 houses, creating 3,900 refugees. In the second district, one hundred and fourteen villages were affected, destroying over 130,000 mu of land and 4,700 houses, drowning over ten people and creating 4,100 refugees.

In the ninth district, thirty-three villages were affected, covering 5,200 mu of land with sand and washing away 6,070 mu of land, washing away 875 houses and collapsing 2,025 houses, creating over 2,100 refugees. Except for the relatively light damage in Districts 7 and 8, the land flooded in Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 is approximately 141,845 mu, and over 34,300 houses were washed away. The number of people drowned has not yet been tallied. Approximately 25,000 refugees are without food. The number of donkeys, horses, pigs, sheep, and other livestock is countless.</p>
<p>Beizhen: Flash floods in Dashi Fort washed away over thirty households, including people and livestock, along the West Street of the village. In addition, Gaotaizi Village and nine small villages nearby in District 3 were turned into a flooded area. Over three thousand refugees, old and young, from Qingduizi, Dayangtai, Sijiazi, and other villages and nearby small villages are without clothing, food, or shelter. Over 2,100 houses in Zhong'an Fort were washed away, affecting over 300 households. Makeshift reed sheds are densely packed together, stretching as far as the eye can see. The air in the city is filled with a foul odor, and it is feared that the refugees will die from starvation or disease if they do not die from the water. It is estimated that a total of 128 men and women drowned in the county, 4,679 houses collapsed, and 77,994 mu of farmland were destroyed.</p>

All the crops were lost, creating 485 refugees. In Pucaopao, 83 houses were washed away and 2,250 mu of farmland were washed away, including 500 mu that have become rivers.

<p>Liaoyuan: From mid-July, heavy rains fell, and the fields were flooded. From August 3rd, heavy rains fell again for three days and nights. On the 11th of the same month, heavy rains fell again without stopping, causing about one-third of the houses of merchants and residents in the county town to collapse. All the earthen courtyard walls completely collapsed. All the schools, police stations, and county government offices suffered the same damage. The riverbank along the river in the county collapsed. After the first heavy rain, a breach of ten zhang occurred at Shijiafen. After the three heavy rains, a breach of over forty zhang occurred at Wudaogangzi in the north of the city. Although the area of the breach is smaller than the farmland, there is no major harm, but the accumulated water is two or three feet deep, and soybeans, grains, etc. are completely submerged and cannot be harvested. Only half of the sorghum is exposed on the water surface. The county predicted a bumper harvest this year, but it has been reduced by 50% (12th).</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The Yuan Committee Reinvestigates the Case of Unauthorized Killing of Fugitives: After receiving reports from local people about the case of the unauthorized killing of escaped prisoners in the county, the High Court immediately sent Committee Member Yao Guozhang to Fengxian to investigate. At the same time, the county government submitted a detailed report on the circumstances to the government. It has now been learned that the High Court has again commissioned Judicial Investigator Shi Zechen to come to Nanqiao yesterday to conduct a reinvestigation. The files related to the case have also been reviewed and investigated. According to his statement before leaving, although the two escaped prisoners were indeed guilty of being shot according to the law, failure to follow legal procedures will inevitably result in appropriate punishment in the future. Case of Arresting Gamblers, Assaulting Police, and Injuring Doctors: The 6th Public Security Bureau dispatched plainclothes detectives to patrol Nantaichiri Bridge on the 18th night. They saw that the gambling business in the Deyilou Restaurant on South Street was very prosperous, so they entered to ban it. The gamblers, seeing that the police were not in uniform, mistakenly believed they were robbers and resisted, causing minor injuries to Patrol Captain Zhou Zhaonan and Constable Huang Ying. The next day, they reported to the General Bureau for inspection. Director Li approved the investigation. It has now been learned that the business community in the town believes that the matter was entirely a misunderstanding, so they advocate a peaceful resolution. Representatives were dispatched to Nanqiao today to negotiate an agreement for the town to subsidize medical expenses, and the tea houses in the town jointly issued a pledge that there would be no more gambling, in order to settle the case.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Shanghai Murderer Sent Back for Retrial: Zhang Huairen, who lived near Sanguantang on Huining Road in Shanghai, had an affair with Yu, the wife of his neighbor Fang Jianwen, last spring. They plotted to kill Zhang and abandon his body in the garbage dump next to the Huining Road Cemetery. The police officers of the 2nd Public Security District under the jurisdiction of the district investigated and arrested Zhang Huairen and transferred him to the Shanghai District Court, which sentenced him to death. Zhang refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court. The High Court concluded the trial on June 18 last year and rejected the appeal. Zhang still refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Criminal Court of the Supreme Court, headed by Judge Xia Qin, has already issued a judgment yesterday (22nd) to send the case back to the High Court for retrial.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Continues to Request Postponement of Telephone Rent Increase: The Suzhou Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications received an order from the Ministry to increase the telephone rent by two yuan starting in September. The Suzhou Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, requesting a postponement of implementation. The Ministry of Communications replied that it was not approved. The General Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of representatives from various industries on the 19th to discuss that the telephone services in Changzhou and Changshu counties are commercially operated, and the rent is cheaper than the original rent of the Suzhou Ministry of Communications telephone service. Government-operated telephones should be cheaper than commercially operated telephones. If the price increase is implemented this time, it will be no different from Shanghai telephones. However, Shanghai's expenses are more frequent than Suzhou's, so it telegraphed the Ministry of Communications again yesterday (22nd) requesting a postponement of the increase.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Wujiang Section Budget Submitted to the Province: The Construction Bureau of the county has now sent personnel to measure and calculate the plan and budget for the bridges, culverts, road surface, and ditch pipes of the Fuhe Road Wujiang to Beizha section.

The Housing of the Tan Tax Collector is Returned to the County: Tan Zhaocheng, the tax collector of Zhenze in the county, absconded with 18,000 yuan of public funds. The Finance Bureau petitioned the county government to seal up his house. The 5th District Office requested the county to return the house and order the landlord to sign a guarantee to take it back, because the house was rented from the Wu family and was not owned by Tan. This has been approved and the Wu family has taken it back.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Shooting between Soldiers and Bandits at Wangting North Bridge: On the 19th, thirty or forty boats of the Liuhe Gang salt smugglers arrived near Tangmen, Jiari, 14th District (Kaihua Township), to sell smuggled salt. The 7th Anti-Smuggling Brigade stationed nearby went to surround and suppress them. The salt smugglers scattered and dared not resist, so they fled. Two smuggling boats were seized on the spot, one empty and the other containing dozens of dan of smuggled salt and forty thousand copper coins. The smugglers on the boat had already escaped into the river. The next day, the boats were escorted to the city. The salt smugglers were very angry because they found out that the four patrol boats of the Anti-Smuggling Team in Sanguantang near Wangting North Bridge, 13th District (Xin'an Township), were being repaired on the shore. On the morning of the 20th, they gathered over ninety smuggling boats and went to harass them. At noon, the 7th Anti-Smuggling Brigade stationed in Sanguantang received a report from a villager that a large number of smuggling boats were coming in formation. The patrol officer of the team immediately ordered the team members to be on strict alert. At that time, a patrol boat of the Anti-Smuggling Team stationed in Suzhou was patrolling outside and passed by Wangting. It was invited to stop by the local tax card and informed of the harassment. The patrol boat immediately sailed to South Bridge and saw over twenty smuggling boats sailing. It followed behind to observe their movements. At 8:00 p.m., the smugglers landed at North Bridge and used flashlights to shine on Sanguantang. The soldiers stationed in the temple saw the light and knew they were bandits, so they opened fire from inside the gate. The smugglers on the bridge also opened fire (the guns were nine-ringed Mauser rifles). The two sides exchanged fire fiercely. One of the bandit leaders blew a whistle to gather the bandits, who used a large number of firewood to burn the anti-smuggling patrol boat next to Sanguantang. The officials of the Wangting Tax Card went to pour water to extinguish the fire. After the smugglers burned the boat, they stormed the headquarters of the Sanguantang Anti-Smuggling Team and looted it. The Anti-Smuggling Team fought back bravely. The two sides fought fiercely for two hours. The bandits could not withstand the pressure and fled to their boats and sailed towards Yangcheng Lake, north of the railway. That night, the military police stationed at the Wangting Railway Bridge also opened fire to pursue them, but were unsuccessful. As a result of the shooting, many smugglers were injured. On the Anti-Smuggling Team side, a patrol officer was shot in the corner of the eye, and a soldier was shot in the leg, with the bullet piercing a large wound. A cook was kidnapped and three pistols were stolen. A house in Sanguantang was also destroyed. All the belongings of the soldiers were looted, causing heavy losses. Yesterday, the injured patrol officers and soldiers were brought to the Puren Hospital for treatment. It is reported that their injuries are not serious. Annual Meeting of the China Economic Society: Yesterday was the third day of the 7th Annual Meeting of the China Economic Society. Over two hundred members and their families attended. Papers were read in the morning, a meeting was held in the afternoon, and the party and group held a banquet in the evening. Robberies and Injuries Occur in Two Cities and Villages: At about 1:00 a.m. last night, over a dozen bandits suddenly came to the home of Zhou Genbao, a resident of Zhouxiang Shang Township, 13th Map, Qingcheng City, under the jurisdiction of the county. Two bandits, armed with guns, climbed over the back door and ransacked the house. They robbed three yuan in silver and twelve jiao in small coins. The bandits were not satisfied, so they beat people. They went to the home of Zhou Genbao's brother, Zhou Shunbao, next door, to rob. At that time, Shunbao heard the alarm and went out to check. He was shot in the right leg by the bandits and immediately fell to the ground and cried for help. His eldest son, Xichen, heard the sound and went to check. He was also seized by the bandits and forced to tell them where the silver was hidden. They fired a shot that hit Xichen below his left breast, and he immediately bled profusely and fell to the ground and died. The bandits then looted the house and left. In this incident, over one hundred and ten yuan in autumn cocoon money was robbed. The incident has been reported to the county and the bandits are being investigated. Also, last night, bandits broke into the home of Xu Peirong, a resident of Tengtianli, Shitou Township, Tianshang, and robbed over twenty yuan in silver and one hundred and twenty yuan in silver that others had deposited there to sell their fields.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery Occurs in Xiaoqiao Bay: On the 21st night, Chang Yangzi, a doctor from Mashanbu, Chang Yangzi, drank tea at the Ronghualou Restaurant outside Cangqiao in the west gate of Wuyi City. He then took a rickshaw into the city and passed through Tang Xiaozizhi in Xiaoqiao Bay. Suddenly, three bandits came. One bandit stepped forward and ordered him to stop the car and pointed a gun at him. The other bandit stepped forward and searched Chang Yangzi and robbed him of all one hundred and seven yuan of silver he had hidden. He fled into a small road towards Shengjiaqiao. Chang then took the original car home.</p>
<p>Huanghezhong Village Set on Fire by Bandits: After the suppression of bandits in Wucheng, it was thought that the bandit situation could be slightly weakened. However, Huanghezhong Village, which is five or six li away from Wuyi Yutang (belonging to Cheng County), was attacked by a large number of bandits, two or three hundred in number, who came by boat at about 12:00 p.m. on the 20th night. After they went to the village, they set fire to it. Forty or fifty villagers scattered and fled. As a result, fifty or sixty houses were burned down by the bandits and several heads of livestock were burned to death. Fortunately, no one was injured. The bandits then looted silver and clothing and sailed the boats to the north of the Yangtze River.</p>

Unexpectedly, over ten bandits, each carrying guns, came to Li Hengqin's house the night before to collect the ransom. Since no one was home, they swarmed to Chen Liansan's house to rob. Since they did not find much, they set fire to the house and fired guns and left.</p>
<p>Bandits Robbed Jiajiaxia: Over ten bandits suddenly came to Jiajiaxia in the county the night before. They had black ashes smeared on their faces and spoke in the local dialect.

<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Rural Police Arrest Gamblers and Resist Arrest: Police from the Shaoxing Lizhu Public Security Bureau went to Nanchishan Wharf to arrest gamblers on the night of the 19th. Because they were not wearing uniforms, it caused a misunderstanding, which led to resistance. The two sides fought each other and suffered minor injuries. The police, because there were only ten people, were outnumbered and fled back to report to the branch director for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Kidnapper Guo Shizhi Sentenced to Death: Kidnapper Guo Shizhi was from Xinyang, Henan. On September 28 last year, he and the bandit leader Kong Kuaizi and six or seven others hired a civilian boat from Wang Ada outside the North Gate to go to Dongqian Shuangqiao. They each carried box cannons and kidnapped Zhu Xiaochun, the owner of the Zhu Hengsheng store. On November 22, he escaped home because the bandit gang fought each other. Afterwards, the Security Team's 2nd Group sent detectives to arrest Guo Shizhi and sent him to the Wuxing Local Branch Court for repeated interrogation. Guo Shizhi confessed to jointly kidnapping and was identified by Zhu Xiaochun as correct. Judge Yu of the court recently sentenced him to death according to law.

<p>Reorganizing the Hangfu Road: The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau has repeatedly planned in detail the problem of traffic on the Hangfu Road and the development of the road's business. Since the road was taken back in the seventeenth year, the entire line of construction has been poorly built and destroyed. In order to fundamentally reorganize the road, a complete reorganization project plan has been drafted, with a budget of over 145,000 yuan. After the entire line is reorganized and leveled, the business will naturally develop gradually. Repairing Gongbu Road: The Hangzhou Municipal Engineering Bureau stated that Gongbu Road has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in a Kangzhuang Avenue that resembles a mountain path. Since the area is a commercial port in Hangzhou where Chinese and foreigners gather, it is bound to be laughed at by foreigners. Public funds should be allocated to order workers to repair it to facilitate transportation, so the engineering expenses have been calculated in order to be submitted to the city government for investigation and repair.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>The Rampancy of the Red Spears Society in Fengtai: In recent years, Anhui Province has been affected by military affairs, and the people of various counties, for self-defense, have mostly joined the Red Spears Society to practice talisman spears to resist banditry. Recently, the power has gradually expanded, and the Red Spears Society in Fengtai County is particularly fierce. The newly編Third Brigade of Zhao Qinglian, stationed in the county, was ordered to go to Yixian County, Shandong Province a few days ago. On the 15th, the officers and soldiers of the Third Battalion of the Eighth Regiment of the brigade set off eastward from Fengtai on several civilian boats. When they arrived at Shitoupu, Ping Xiangjiu, the leader of the local Red Spears Society, led nearby members to block the river, declaring that they could not pass without surrendering their guns. Seeing this, the battalion commander, fearing a misunderstanding, stopped the soldiers from firing and informed the Red Spears Society members that they were Central Army troops passing through, and urged them not to act rashly. Before he could finish speaking, the members swarmed onto the boats and stabbed wildly with their spears. Seeing that there was no way to reason, the battalion commander ordered the soldiers to hand over their weapons to the society. The entire battalion had a total of 284 long and short guns, more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 7,000 yuan in provisions, all of which were looted. The officers and soldiers of the battalion arrived near Bengbu Railway Station on the 18th and immediately reported to the brigade headquarters. Brigade Commander Zhao Qinglian immediately telegraphed General Commander Chiang for instructions.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Letter from the Fourth Brigade of the Suzhou Customs Anti-Smuggling Department:</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, your newspaper's Jinshan communication reported that our brigade searched and suppressed bandits at Qianjiawei South Shejiao Bridge and immediately captured a bandit named Wu Azhao. He confessed to having many accomplices and pointed out where they were hiding. Therefore, we went to the home of bandit Chen Caigen north of Liujiawei Bridge and arrested Chen Caigen and Dai Kechang together, and confiscated eight guns and ammunition. At that time, Wu Azhao was shot and killed as a warning. Chen Caigen was interrogated briefly and sent to the county for punishment. However, Dai Kechang was released after showing some kind of symbol specially issued by Taibao Ashu, etc. After investigation, our brigade captured Wu Azhao and Chen Caigen, and one Mauser pistol. In addition to Wu Azhao being killed on the spot for resisting arrest with a gun, we also seized one Mauser pistol and more than ten rounds of ammunition. Chen Caigen was sent to the county for interrogation. However, the report that eight guns were seized and that Dai Kechang was not captured but was released because he showed some kind of symbol specially issued by Taibao Ashu is not true. This matter concerns the reputation of our brigade. Please correct it. Respectfully, the Fourth Brigade of the Suzhou Five Districts Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Department, 9/20.</p>

<p>Principals of Primary and Secondary Schools Took an Oath Yesterday</p>
<p>Please Issue the July and August Education Fees</p>
<p>Assistance to Principal Xiao Mingqin of Suqian Middle School</p>
<p>Doubts About Being Re-Hired as Appointed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Primary and Secondary Schools started this academic year with the Education Department re-hiring them as appointed. Schools across the province opened one after another. In order to attach importance to education in Jiangsu Province, the Education Department specially ordered the principals of various primary and secondary schools to come to the province and take an oath of office today (22nd) in the auditorium of the Education Department. The provincial government members also held a public banquet this afternoon. The auditorium of the Education Department was newly decorated in advance, and the ceremony was grand. The principals of various schools arrived in Zhenjiang one after another on the 20th. That afternoon, they held a meeting in Zhenjiang Middle School in the name of the Secondary School Education Research Association. Regarding the excessive accumulation of education funds and the misfortune of Principal Xiao Mingqin of Suqian Middle School in Qingjiang, there was a general resignation resolution. It was announced that night that whether to take the oath of office and request assistance was also mentioned. At 4 pm on the 21st, the principals of various middle schools met again in Zhenjiang, and the principals of various primary schools met in Zhenjiang Shixiao. On the middle school side, Ren Min of Zhenjiang, Wang Xiacai of Huai'an, Xiao Mingqin of Suqian, Zhou Cheng of Beiyangzhou, Zhu Lu of Zheng Xigu, Chen Shu of Shanghai, Tao Xuan of Jiang Xuezhuyu Zhongchao, Liao Jianan of Su Nong, Zhang Jingdai Chen Gu, Cen Han of Yanmen Huai Nong, and Shen Zhensheng Ren Zhongmin (representative) were present.</p>
<p>Regarding the resignation, assistance to Principal Xiao, and urging the issuance of funds, reorganizing the fund management office, and whether the oath ceremony today would be held simultaneously or in sequence, opinions differed. Some advocated resigning immediately, while others advocated not resigning but requesting a postponement of the oath. The reasons were: 1. No funds; 2. No solution to the Xiao case, no guarantee of official duty; 3. Doubts about being re-hired as appointed. Ren Zhongmin, Wang Xiacai, Zheng Xigu, and Zhou Cheng were elected as representatives to meet with Director Chen of the Education Department. However, it was a weekday and they were received by Secretary Yao Yuanxu and Section Chief Duan Yuhua, and they did not get to the point. The middle school principals returned to their residences to discuss, and opinions were even more divided. Some said that assistance to Principal Xiao and requesting the issuance of funds could not be confused with resignation, and that the principals had come specifically for the oath ceremony, and it would be inappropriate to request a postponement. Also, whether to doubt being re-hired as appointed should be considered before accepting the appointment. Now that the principals have all arrived at their posts, classes have started, and there are still doubts, which seems contradictory. As a result, it was decided that at 9 am this morning, a joint meeting would be held with the principals of primary schools in Xizhong to make a final decision on whether to take office.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang, 22nd special telegram: The Jiangsu Primary and Secondary School Principals took an oath in the Education Department this morning. The ceremony was grand. Thirty-six principals attended. He Yushu supervised the oath. Yang Xingqin gave a speech on behalf of the Provincial Party Department. They had lunch together. At 2 pm, a discussion meeting was held. At 5 pm, they visited the Public Education Hall. On the 23rd, they went to Nanjing to request the issuance of arrears from the Fund Management Office.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary School Principals</h3>
<p>Many Discussions on the Issue of Funds</p>
<p>From 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm on the 22nd, the principals of the Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary Schools gathered at Zhenjiang Shixiao to hold the second principals' meeting.

Xie Shouxian presided, Shi Renfu recorded, and the ceremony was as usual. First, the chairman reported on the request to the Education Department to increase the funds of each school by 20%. Then Ma Ketan reported on the current situation of the auditing of education funds in Jiangsu Province by the Education Funds Audit Committee: A. The funds for July and August of this year have not been issued. The Fund Management Office currently has about 100,000 yuan in savings. It has been requested to convene a meeting of the Funds Committee as soon as possible to solve all the problems, but it has not been possible to convene a meeting so far. B. The Audit Committee has resolved to request the Funds Committee to ask an accountant to thoroughly investigate and organize the accounts of the office. C. The Education Funds Management Office has many objections to the budget proposal for education funds in this province for the 19th year.</p>
<p>Resolutions: 1. The funds of each school have been in arrears for three months, making it impossible to maintain them. How should we try to recover them? The resolution method is roughly the same as the resolution of the middle school principals' meeting yesterday, except that: (1) Regarding the request to the Funds Committee to reorganize the Funds Management Office, add several specific opinions on reorganization.

(6) The above cases should be carried out jointly with the middle school principals, and Xie Shouxian, Ma Ketan, Li Banghe, and Shi Renfu are appointed to contact the middle school principals first. 2. Discuss the special business expenses of each school. Resolution: A. Send a letter to the Education Funds Committee to maintain the budget proposal for the 19th year and express opinions on the Management Office's reply to the Education Department's official letter. B. Request the Education Department to quickly approve the local education instructors recommended by each school. 3. Urge the Education Department to quickly allocate the temporary expenses for this year. Resolution: Request the Education Department to quickly allocate them. 4.

<h3>Dean Wang Shengshan of Jiaoda Mechanical Engineering College Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Shengshan, an expert in railway mechanical engineering and the current dean of the Mechanical Engineering College of Jiaotong University, represented the Ministry of Railways and Jiaotong University in early April of this year to attend the International Railway Association Congress held in Madrid, Spain, and the World Power Conference held in Berlin, Germany, and was responsible for inspecting the famous industrial countries of Europe and America. The mission has now been completed. He took the Empress of Japan back to the country from the United States and arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (21st). It is also learned that Wang suffered a great tragedy during this trip. His respected father, Mr. Wei Qi, whose courtesy name is Ji Zhen, was a revolutionary pioneer. In recent years, due to his weak health, he has been recuperating in Shanghai. Although he felt old and sick, he still urged Wang to make the trip to serve the country. At the time of his death, he instructed his family not to send a telegram to inform him so that he could complete the mission he was responsible for. Therefore, Wang only received the bad news after arriving in Shanghai. The right side is a recent photo of him.</p>

<p>Pay Attention to the Issue of the Successor President</p>
<p>People Intended to Be Selected are Yang Xingfo and Two Others</p>

Now, because all the important figures in the central government who concurrently served as presidents of national universities have been relieved of their concurrent presidential positions, Yi was also approved to be relieved of his concurrent position at the State Council meeting the day before yesterday. However, the candidate for successor has not yet been determined. The students of the school, believing that the school affairs cannot be without a president at the beginning of this autumn semester, specially convened a general meeting yesterday (22nd) morning initiated by Zhu Shuxian and others. Sun Letao, Yuan Zhe, Sun Kexing, and Sun Zhaoqian were elected as the chairman group. The standards for the candidate for president were set as follows: 1. Have a position in the academic and social circles; 2. Recognize and support labor education; 3. Have experience in managing higher education; 4. Be able to concentrate on managing the school. Then, it was decided that the candidates would be Yang Xingfo, Yu Youren, and Hu Shuhua. It is heard that they will immediately submit a request to the central government to hire them.</p>

Meiji's Ii and Nakamatsu, and Teikyo University's Ryobashi and Kobayashi, all have famous players. In particular, Teikyo University's Takahashi pitcher has the best pitching skills, making Meiji's level of Matsui, Iiyama, etc. unable to do anything. It is expected that Takahashi's skills will be fully utilized in the game against Waseda University, and all parties are praising it. As a result, this battle succeeded in Teikyo University's revenge match with 2A, and the interest in the third battle is even greater. The scores and results of each attack by the two armies that day are as follows:</p>

<h3>The Health Team Wins Two Consecutive Games</h3>
<p>The Score Difference is Very Large</p>
<p>Children Should Not Be Underestimated</p>
<p>Since the Health Children's Basketball Team was reorganized and practiced regularly, the team's skills have improved day by day. The day before yesterday afternoon, the team met with the Nancang team, which won the amateur basketball league Group A championship in the city's first gymnasium last year, and showed even more power. It is said that the Nancang team members are all veterans, and the addition of the famous player Ni Shiming this time should make their strength even stronger. Unexpectedly, the Health's front line connected the left, right, and center forwards in a continuous attack, with both speed and skill. Nancang initially resisted desperately, but later became increasingly difficult to advance or retreat. It is also surprising that a once-famous elite army was defeated by children. The score was 44 to 13, a difference of 31 points. Yesterday afternoon, Health again played against the Nanshi Mixed Team. Before a few rounds could be played, the strong team formation gradually became scattered and barely supported, eventually collapsing. The score was 75 to 24, Health won by 55 points. The battlefields were all in the city's first public gymnasium.</p>

After a fierce battle, the two Wangs won by six to four and then six. In the afternoon, they were planning to compete again in separate venues, but the merciless autumn rain forced them to postpone. Also, there are 20 double matches that were postponed due to the rain the day before yesterday. The association has divided the groups and arranged the order of the makeup matches, notifying members to arrive at the venue on time.

<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Two Telegrams Sent the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Responding to Zhang Xueliang's Urgent Telegram from Liaoning</p>
<p>Urging Yan and Feng to Step Down</p>
<p>To Uphold the Overall Situation and Achieve Unification</p>
<p>The municipal government received an urgent telegram from Zhang Xueliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast, the day before yesterday. It immediately sent a reply telegram and a circular telegram that evening, which are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Reply Telegram (Urgent): To Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang of Shenyang, esteemed sir. I have received your urgent telegram. I deeply admire your love for the Party and the country, your love for the people, and your advocacy for unification and peace. All measures that stabilize the overall situation and satisfy the people's aspirations should await the Central Government's clear and just arrangements. Your noble words are deeply appreciated by all my comrades. Since Yan and Feng started the war in the Central Plains, the generals have been coerced and the soldiers have been abducted, reviving the ashes of warlords and spreading the remnants of feudalism. For months, the people of Henan, both north and south of the river, have been plunged into misery. They even established a false government to undermine the Party and the country, colluding with communist bandits and burning and looting Hunan. Our people have suffered a terrible calamity. The Central Government, to eliminate violence for the people and quell the rebellion for the country, has reluctantly launched a military campaign as a last resort. Therefore, even after recovering Jinan and defeating the rebel armies of Longhai, Pinghan, and Jinpu, we still showed compassion and did not rejoice, repeatedly admonishing them in the hope that they would repent and return. All this demonstrates our sincerity in seeking a compromise and not resorting to aggressive warfare, but only to consolidate unification, guarantee peace, maintain the Party and the country's discipline, and complete the revolutionary cause. Now that political tutelage has just begun, the people are suffering and awaiting relief, and we are striving to govern in every way. The Central Government's punishment is limited to the ringleaders. The officers and soldiers on the other side are also our own people. If Yan and Feng release their military power and leave their so-called defense zones, the Central Government will be lenient and will not punish those who were coerced. If they have not strayed too far and repent and surrender, the Central Government will treat them equally. The distinction between obedience and rebellion is clear, and the opportunity for safety or danger is imminent. You, sir, are concerned about the people's suffering and are mindful of their hunger and drowning. We hope that you will display your great talent, uphold justice, urge Yan and Feng to step down, release the people from their distress, maintain a public heart to await the Central Government's arrangements, and establish a great cause of upholding the overall situation and achieving unification, transforming the atmosphere of war into peace and security, and establishing the country on a solid foundation. The Party and the country will be fortunate, and the world will be fortunate. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Circular Telegram (Urgent): To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, and the various Yuan, Departments, and Committees; to the Party Headquarters of the various Provinces and Cities; to the Governments of the various Provinces and Cities; to the various Commanders-in-Chief, Commanders, Division Commanders, Brigade Commanders; to the various Legal Organizations and Newspapers: I have received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang of Shenyang, which reads: "Urgent: To Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang of Shenyang, esteemed sir (same as above)." I hereby send this telegram for your careful consideration. All my comrades, please uphold justice, maintain the public heart of Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang to await the Central Government's arrangements, and unanimously advocate urging Yan and Feng to step down to alleviate the ravages of war and stabilize the overall situation. Do not act on wishful thinking. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

Cai Yuanpei also arrived on the same ship with his family after attending the annual meeting of the China Science Society in Qingdao. They arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. Those who went to Huangpu Wharf to welcome them included Wu Zhihui, Yang Xingfo, Qian Xinzhi, Chang Yaokui, Chen Jiannan, Qi Yunqing, Xiao Wenxi, and Li Xixian. After disembarking, Li shook hands with each of the welcomers and immediately took a car with Chang Yaokui, the general manager of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and others to his residence. Cai disembarked at 2:30 PM, shook hands with Wu Zhihui, Yang Xingfo, and others, exchanged greetings, and then returned to his residence with his family. Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, Wei Daoming, Mayor of Nanjing, and Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, were all waiting at Li's residence on Ferguson Road. Wu Zhihui also arrived at Li's residence and chatted with them. At 5:30 PM, Li Shizeng and Wu Zhihui went to Zhang Jingjiang's residence to meet with him because Zhang had arrived in Shanghai from Beijing as the Chairman of Zhejiang Province. During the voyage, Li Shizeng spoke with a reporter from the New Voice Society as follows: "How is the situation in the Northeast?" He replied, "Completely loyal to the Central Government." "When will Commander-in-Chief Zhang take office as Deputy Commander?" He replied, "In the shortest possible time." "Is Zhang Yuejun planning to travel south?" He replied, "He will return to Shanghai after Commander-in-Chief Zhang takes office." "What is the news about the Japanese? Is it true that the Central Government has appointed Wu Tiecheng and Fang Benren to take over the military and political organs, and that they will go to Peiping to discuss it with you?" He replied, "I had not heard about this when I left. Their trip is also uncertain." "Are there still representatives of Yan and Feng remaining in Shenyang?" He replied, "They have all left; there is no one left." According to his secretary, Mr. Ma, the Beining Railway was open to Luzhou the day after Li's departure. After the urgent telegram was published, Yan and Feng's representatives, Jia Jingde and Xue Dubi, were very frightened and wanted to return but could not. It is said that they have now arrived in Peiping and plan to return to Dalian by sea. According to Cai Yuanpei, "I went to Qingdao to attend the China Science Research Association. The association was held from August 13th to 17th, lasting five days. In addition to presenting several papers, I also discussed association affairs. After the closing meeting, I stayed in the area to escape the summer heat."</p>
<h3>Financial Conference Concluded</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Returned to Nanjing Last Night</p>
<p>A Solution for Abolishing Likin Has Been Discussed</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, held a financial conference in Shanghai for several days to discuss streamlining national finances and abolishing likin. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he held a final meeting at the Ministry of Finance's office in the Central Bank building. The directors of the various departments of the Ministry of Finance and other important officials attended. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM, and a conclusion was reached on the various proposals. A solution for abolishing likin was also determined. Song Ziwen returned to Nanjing by overnight train last night. A reporter from this newspaper specially went to interview him. He said, "I am going to Nanjing to offer condolences on the death of President Tan. This financial conference in Shanghai was to discuss various issues related to streamlining national finances. Special attention was paid to the abolition of likin, and this has now come to a conclusion. A solution for abolishing likin has also been discussed. I originally intended to discuss it with President Tan after returning to Nanjing so that it could be implemented, but now that Tan has passed away, it will have to be delayed for a while." When asked whether he would be temporarily acting as President of the Executive Yuan, Song said that he had not heard anything about it and would decide after returning to Nanjing and consulting with all parties.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>Government Funds Must Be Requested</p>
<p>Committees Formed to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>The export of raw silk is our country's largest foreign trade. In the past three years, it has been subjected to environmental pressures and has entered an unsustainable state. Since the rise of the labor movement, the burden on silk factories has increased dramatically. In addition, the raw material harvest has been poor, increasing costs. Japan has implemented economic policies to defeat Chinese silk, sparing no expense to suppress prices and compete for sales. The Japanese government has repeatedly allocated large sums to help its domestic silk merchants. The first loan was for 5 million yen. When the price of silk fell to 800 yen, the Japanese government ordered the national bank to allocate funds to accept stored silk as collateral, at a rate of 1,200 yen per picul. As a result, the bank accepted 200,000 bales of stored silk as collateral. Subsequently, the price of silk continued to fall to over 600 yen. The Japanese government specially raised the price of silk to purchase 80,000 bales to maintain it at all costs. Chinese silk factories are small businesses with weak capital. They have neither the strength to compete with them nor the means to sustain themselves. The government has been preoccupied with wars for years and has not been able to provide economic assistance. As a result, nine out of ten silk factories are losing money and cannot maintain themselves. The Shanghai Silk Factory Association has repeatedly received reports from its members, all claiming that they are exhausted and in a precarious situation. They strongly request that appropriate relief be planned quickly to restore the position of raw silk in foreign trade. Shen Huachen, chairman of the association, saw this dangerous situation and, believing that there would be a collapse without relief, specially convened a general meeting of members on the afternoon of the day before yesterday for a detailed discussion. All agreed that this matter concerns not only the silk factory industry. Taking the city as an example, the number of loans from the banking industry to silk factories is about 30 to 40 million. If a shutdown occurs, it will not only affect social finance, but also international exchange rates, which will have a profound impact on national taxation and finance. If we want to maintain the future of the silk industry, we must actively request that the government allocate funds for relief in order to protect national finance and social stability. It was unanimously decided that the Shanghai Silk Factory Association Committee would request relief from the government and appoint Chairman Shen Huachen and Standing Committee members Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinfan, Wu Shenbo, Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Yunsheng, and Huang Jinchen to handle the relief matters. Yesterday afternoon, Chairman Shen invited the Standing Committee members to a meeting at Yizhixiang to discuss the implementation plan and decided to appeal to the government for relief within days to maintain the silk industry and avoid bankruptcy.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Dutch Inclusion Tax Case</h3>
<p>Another Request for Negotiation to Cancel</p>
<p>Telegram from the Overseas Chinese Federation</p>
<p>Implementing Revolutionary Diplomacy</p>
<p>Striving for Equality Between China and the Netherlands</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the day before yesterday, saying, "Regarding the Department's No. 246 telegram, we have learned about the Guangyuan telegram and have telegraphed the Consul General in Java to verify and negotiate. A reply has been sent, etc." We are deeply grateful for your concern for the suffering of overseas Chinese. After the Consul General verified and negotiated, we do not know if he has reported back. If the Dutch government has agreed to cancel it, our countrymen will always remember their great achievements. Otherwise, the revolutionary diplomacy advocated by our Party must be implemented to inform the world. We urge the Department to take decisive action and telegraph the relevant envoys and consuls to continue to strive for it. We also formally notify the Dutch government in writing that if it does not cancel the Dutch East Indies Colonial Council's resolution to increase the immigration tax for immigrants from the Far East to 150 guilders, our government will also levy the same amount of immigration tax on Dutch overseas Chinese coming to China in order to strive for equality, and they will not be able to enjoy the most-favored-nation treatment enjoyed by other countries that do not levy immigration taxes on overseas Chinese. The number of overseas Chinese going to Dutch territories is greater than the number of Dutch overseas Chinese coming to China. Counteracting the tax levy is indeed unfavorable to our side. However, it is better than being slaughtered and having no resistance. Moreover, the purpose of international tax retaliation is not entirely economic, but also for the sake of justice. When the United States added new tariffs, various countries immediately changed their heavy tariffs on the United States to retaliate, not necessarily balancing every penny, but also to show the authority of each independent country and the equality of their status with each other. Our country's cowards often use the excuse that weak countries have no diplomacy, allowing various countries to bully and humiliate us, which is what the 400 million people hate most. Taking a step back and saying that it is difficult to resist the strong, the Netherlands is a small country whose territory is less than a province of our country. Why are we so afraid of it and listen to it abusing us in every way, daring not to look at it squarely? Is our country really the weakest in the world? Even a small country like the Netherlands thinks it is a strong country that we cannot do anything about? If this is the case, then our country, which is large but useless, is truly ashamed and has no way to justify itself. The slogan of overthrowing imperialism that we have been shouting is only ridiculed by the five continents and ten thousand countries. We are by no means despising the Netherlands. We are only seeking to be equal with small countries like the Netherlands first, in order to achieve the goal of the first step of revolution. If it is said that the Dutch increase in immigration tax is a matter of internal affairs and foreign countries cannot interfere, then this is another seemingly correct but actually wrong argument. Internal affairs involving foreigners contain diplomatic qualities, and those harmed have the right to request their country to protest. For example, if our country wants to universally levy immigration tax on foreigners, apart from the retaliation against the Netherlands, there would be no problem, but would it not cause protests from other countries? Time is passing, and time waits for no one. The implementation period of the tax increase in 1931 is approaching in an instant. Waiting for it to be implemented and then fighting for it will be difficult and twice as difficult as today. Why not negotiate as soon as possible? The Governor of the Dutch East Indies has superior privileges and can cancel the resolutions of the colony's colonial council. The overseas Chinese in the Netherlands can also rely on the government's revolutionary diplomacy to slightly reduce the pain of the extra burden. The timing is urgent, and we beg you to send a telegraph to the relevant envoys and consuls as soon as possible to strive for the cancellation of the case. We sincerely plead and express our sincere prayers. The Overseas Chinese Federation kowtows.</p>

<h3>Do Not Increase the Price of Tap Water Before Auditing the Accounts</h3>
<p>Letter from the Real Estate Association to the Taxpayer Association of Shanghai: We are writing to you regarding the Shanghai Waterworks Company's increase in water prices. We are grateful that your association, representing the interests of the residents, has actively negotiated to cancel the increase. Although there has been no immediate result, the Shanghai Waterworks Company has sent a letter requesting that your association and our association send representatives to audit the accounts. Before we are convinced that there is sufficient reason for the price increase, the increase will naturally not be implemented. We believe that your association shares this sentiment. We plan to send a letter to the Shanghai Waterworks Company before sending representatives to audit the accounts, requesting that they promptly send us the company's annual operating reports since its establishment for our study. This is a matter of common interest, so we are writing to you specially to inform you. We would be grateful if you could inform us of your association's progress on this matter. Sincerely, the Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association, the Shanghai Real Estate Association.</p>
<p>Notice from the Taxpayer Association Convening the Executive Committee: The Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association has received a letter from the Shanghai Waterworks Company requesting the selection of representatives to inspect the company's net profit accounts. It has specially convened the Executive Committee to discuss the selection of representatives and other issues. The following notice was sent to the various members of the association yesterday: We are writing to inform you that we have scheduled a meeting of the Executive Committee to be held at 4:00 PM on September 23rd (Tuesday) at the association's building at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to discuss the Waterworks Company's request to send representatives to audit the accounts and other issues. In addition to sending separate notices, we are writing to inform you specially and request that you attend the meeting at the scheduled time.</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Solution to Resist Japanese Cocoons</h3>
<p>Is to Request Government Tax Exemptions and Export Subsidies for Chinese Silk. The other day, the Zhejiang General Association sent a letter to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association proposing ways to resist the import of Japanese cocoons. Yesterday, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association replied to the Zhejiang General Association, defending the need to alleviate the shortage of raw materials in Shanghai silk factories. The Zhejiang General Association's main goal is to solve the fundamental problem of silk cocoons by requesting government tax exemptions for silk cocoons and subsidizing the export of Chinese silk, following the Japanese model. If this goal can be achieved, then it will not be difficult to resist the import of Japanese cocoons. The draft of the Zhejiang General Association's reply to the Silk Cocoon General Association is excerpted below: We have received your reply. The issue of purchasing Japanese cocoons is viewed by your association as a way to alleviate the shortage of raw materials in Shanghai silk cocoons, while the people of Zhejiang view it as fueling the Japanese ambition to invade Chinese silk. Different people have different opinions, so there is no need to discuss it further. The reason why our association is still taking the trouble to speak is that the decline of Chinese silk has reached its extreme. The urgent telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting tax exemptions for Chinese silk exports is a fundamental solution. We hope to rely on your association to unite the silk cocoon merchants of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to jointly advocate and appeal for the purpose of achieving tax exemptions, reducing the cost of Chinese silk, and promoting sales. We have long known that your association has been trusted by the government. Last time, you requested a reduction in the import tax on Japanese cocoons and were able to get approval. Today, you are pleading for the silk cocoon merchants of our country, and you will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. We have heard that the Japanese government subsidized the export of Japanese silk last year, spending tens of millions from the national treasury. If we rely on your association's strong support to follow the Japanese model and request that the government grant subsidies as appropriate, so that silk factories will not have to suspend operations midway and hundreds of thousands of workers will be able to obtain relief, then the stored cocoons in the interior can also be sold smoothly without hindrance. The silk cocoon merchants will be deeply grateful. Jiahu, Hangzhou, and Shaoxing in Zhejiang are the most prosperous areas for silkworm rearing. The livelihoods of millions of households are at stake, which is different from the situation in the few counties in Jiangsu and Anhui that produce silkworms. The reliance is deep, so we cannot help but expect it to be urgent. It is not that the people of Zhejiang like to meddle in things. We also hope that your association will take pity and plan for it. Our association will be very fortunate, and the people of Zhejiang will be very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Japanese Expulsion of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The Qingtian Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai telegraphed the diplomatic authorities yesterday, saying: To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Minister Wang of the Embassy in Japan, and various newspapers: Xu Qu, a business representative who was expelled from Japan and returned to China, has detailed the expulsion process to our association, which is outrageous. The scope of expulsion was previously limited to laborers, but now it extends to businessmen. The excuses they use are increasingly picky. In the past, they looked for trouble and falsely accused people of being guilty of filth and gambling. Now, they have become even more unscrupulous, even accusing playing chess of gambling. A slight difference in the name or an occasional forgetting of the date of landing is falsely accused of smuggling. In July of this year, small-scale Chinese merchants in Otaru, Sapporo, Kutchan, Nayoro, and Obihiro in Hokkaido were arrested and detained for no reason. A Japanese police officer from the Otaru Maritime Police Station publicly stated that because the Japanese industry was in a severe recession, all small-scale Chinese merchants had to be deported back to their country. The situation was fierce and unreasonable. The Chinese merchants, intimidated by their accumulated power, dared not argue, but politely requested a grace period to end their business and settle their accounts before voluntarily returning to their country. The Japanese police officer refused to accept and immediately forced them to sign pre-prepared statements and put their fingerprints on them. There were two types of statements: one confessed that as a result of the recession, business was difficult and they wanted to return to their country, but they had no travel expenses and asked the station to provide assistance and repatriation out of the spirit of being of the same ethnicity; the other confessed to stealing items and violating police regulations. The Japanese police officer gave the first type of statement to those who were neatly dressed and forced them to sign immediately. At that time, those Chinese merchants who did not understand Japanese were ordered to sign as if their lives depended on it. However, those who understood Japanese slightly refused to obey because the slander was too much and the humiliation was too great. But with the slightest hesitation, the Japanese police officers would beat them with fists and feet and threaten to kill them. The Chinese merchants, intimidated by their power and unable to endure the pain, had no choice but to swallow their tears and endure the humiliation of signing. With the statements in hand, the Japanese police officers released all the Chinese merchants and sent them back to their country. At the same time, they instructed the Hokkaido Times newspaper to publish news, saying that as a result of the general recession in Japan, the lives of overseas Chinese were also greatly affected. Yesterday, the Otaru Maritime Police Station negotiated with a shipping company to reduce the passenger fare from 35 yuan per person to 20 yuan. Fifty Chinese merchants, including those who were repatriated earlier by the Dairai Maru, cheered all the way. This kind of self-deception and counter-propaganda can be said to be hypocritical and shameless to the extreme, and the cruelty and insidiousness of Japanese imperialism, disregarding good faith, has been fully exposed. We request that the government sternly lodge a protest, and the public groups unanimously condemn it. The number of Japanese residing in our country, engaging in agriculture, industry, and commerce, is dozens or hundreds of times that of the number of Chinese overseas Chinese staying in Japan. The economic benefits that they have plundered from our country are not insignificant. Our government spares no effort to protect Japanese overseas Chinese. Even in the past, the Nanjing and Jinan incidents, in which Japanese overseas Chinese property was accidentally damaged during the war, caused serious protests, even to the point of bombarding our cities and occupying our land, and still demanding compensation from us. Now, the Japanese are using this kind of inhumane private torture and false accusations against our overseas Chinese in a time of peace, then what do they think of our Chinese nation? We want to cry but cannot. If we still remain silent about this, then will our Chinese nation have any descendants in the future? We deeply hope that our compatriots will rise up and work together to plan the way forward, and we especially hope that our government will argue with reason and not show any weakness. Our association will be very fortunate, and the country will be very fortunate. The Qingtian Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai kowtows.</p>

<h3>Du Yuesheng Generously Raises Funds for the Liaoxi Famine Relief</h3>

<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng has, over the years, provided substantial relief to various provinces suffering from floods and droughts. His perseverance and enthusiasm are admired by society.

Du, with his inherent compassion, plans to hold a three-day fundraising performance, aiming to raise 100,000 yuan to be directly remitted to the Liaoxi Flood Relief Association, which is affiliated with the Northeast Cultural Society.</p>
<h3>Residents of Qingyun Lane Petition for Assistance</h3>
<p>A Petition to the National Government</p>
<p>A petition from the residents of Qingyun Lane to the National Government for assistance states (title omitted): "Respectfully submitting this petition because the landlord, the British company Sassoon &amp; Co., is illegally pursuing eviction, inciting Russian thugs to wantonly destroy property, injure people, and loot belongings, and we earnestly request swift protection to safeguard national dignity and protect the lives of the people. We, the members of the association, consisting of over 400 households, have been renting houses in Qingyun Lane from Sassoon &amp; Co. The houses were last renovated only 13 years ago, are still in good condition, and there is absolutely no need for reconstruction. However, the company, greedy for the hefty bribe offered by the Great China Company for excavation and rental rights, intends to evict all the residents in the lane and suddenly issued a notice in June, ordering them to move out and hand over the houses by the end of August so that construction can begin. It is generally accepted that houses must be at least 20 years old before they need to be rebuilt. Therefore, tenants are willing to invest substantial funds to decorate and renovate the houses, expecting to live there for at least 20 years to recoup their investment. Moreover, at the beginning of the lease, the landlord demanded various fees, such as small rent payments, which cost several hundred taels of silver for each house. The expenses are several times higher for those who use the houses as shops. Regarding the rent, the landlord has special privileges to arbitrarily increase the rent burden on the tenants. If there is no fixed period for construction and renovation, and the landlord can arbitrarily bring tenants in and send them away, then the tenants are truly in a difficult situation. Moreover, at a time when finances are tight, the market is sluggish, and prices are soaring, people are struggling to survive, and this sudden and unexpected loss is an unbearable burden for weak merchants and civilians. Furthermore, there are very few empty houses in Shanghai, making it difficult to find a place to move. Unfortunately, they are being forced to face bankruptcy and unemployment. All the residents in the lane are in a state of panic and have repeatedly sent letters and dispatched representatives, and finally entrusted lawyer Chen Tingrui to send a letter, earnestly appealing to the company to withdraw its decision. However, the company is driven solely by profit and has no compassion. It has resorted to harsh measures, such as cutting off electricity and water, to control the lives of the residents in the lane. Fortunately, the electricity and water companies understand the situation and were not deceived. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have upheld justice and sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting them to handle the matter impartially, promptly stop the company's illegal actions, and notify all police stations not to dispatch officers to assist the company in its wrongdoing and prevent any trouble from arising. Subsequently, we received a reply from the Council, stating that this dispute should be resolved by the court and that the police would only maintain order and enforce court orders, except for executing court orders. The company, having failed in its repeated cunning schemes, has become even more reckless. On the morning of September 10, it hired over 200 White Russian thugs who swarmed in like a swarm of bees, without any demolition permits from the relevant authorities. They acted like bandits, climbing onto the roofs and forcibly demolishing them, throwing bricks indiscriminately, injuring people, and looting belongings. Three residents, Miao Shelai, Li Achang, and Ye Chenglin, were injured, and their clothes, money, and household utensils were looted, resulting in substantial losses. All the residents in the lane were subjected to destruction and were unable to resist. They immediately went to the police station to request protection. It was not until the police dispatched officers to stop them that order was restored. Sassoon &amp; Co. is a large merchant from a civilized country and should not resort to such illegal violence. Their intention is to oppress the weak and small ethnic groups and despise the Chinese. Such disregard for the law is a disturbance of public order. The Municipal Council is responsible for maintaining public order and protecting citizens and should prosecute the company for its deserved crimes. Furthermore, the Russian thugs are greedy, cruel, and lawless and are prone to seeking profit. Allowing them to reside in the country for an extended period and be used by others will endanger the security of our country. We, the members of the association, are in a helpless and precarious situation. In addition to petitioning the various party and government organs in Shanghai, we are submitting this petition to Your Excellency, requesting swift protection. We also request that the local diplomatic authorities file a serious protest and stop the other party's illegal actions, seek legal avenues to resolve this dispute, and rescue the over 400 citizens in the lane from the fire and water. We also request that all the Russian thugs be expelled from the country to safeguard national rights and protect the lives of the people. Otherwise, we Chinese citizens in the concession will inevitably be helpless and left at the mercy of the landlord, the big landowner, Sassoon &amp; Co. The situation is urgent, and we humbly submit this petition, pleading for Your Excellency to consider the plight of the over 400 citizens who are desperately seeking rescue and approve our request and swiftly implement it, which would be a great act of kindness. Respectfully submitted by Tang Huilian, Gao Jieyuan, Zhou Ganchen, Wan Peiyuan, and Lu Tingsheng, citizens of Qingyun Lane, Hongkou District, Shanghai Special District."</p>
<h3>Another Housing Dispute</h3>
<p>Fuxing Lane on Maigen Road to be Renovated Without Cause</p>
<p>The Fuxing Lane Tenant Association on Maigen Road received a letter on the 2nd of this month from the landlord, Wing On Real Estate Company, stating that the houses in the lane would be renovated starting from the end of this month, and all tenants in the lane must move out before the end of this month. Upon hearing the news, the more than 400 families in the lane were extremely surprised. The landlord did not provide the three-month notice for demolition as is customary in Shanghai and refused to waive three months' rent. They immediately hired lawyer Gan Lin and sent a letter requesting a postponement of the renovation. Yesterday, the Fuxing Lane Tenant Association received a reply from lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing Wing On Real Estate Company, through lawyer Gan, stating that the renovation of the houses must be approved by the end of this month and that they must move out. Currently, all the tenants in the lane believe that Fuxing Lane was not built long ago and that the proposed renovation is unjustified. They have heard that they will publish an announcement in the newspaper to appeal to all sectors of society and seek legal protection as a last resort.</p>

We look forward to your cooperation."</p>
<h3>Departmental Approval for Revised Hide Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Red-Tanned Hide Trade Association yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, we received your letter of August 26, stating that the import tax rates for red-tanned hides are inappropriate and requesting that they be reclassified and taxed according to grade and that the tax rates be reduced. We forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for review and processing. On the 20th of this month, we received approval No. 10971 from the Ministry of Finance, which stated: 'We have received and reviewed the submitted letter and the previous request from the association. We have learned that the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce previously requested a reduction in import tax rates for red cowhides imported from Southeast Asia. The current import tariff already has different tax rates for cowhides. If it is believed that the tax classification is not fair, the merchant should submit samples to the Customs office at the port of entry for review and processing, and the Ministry will issue instructions accordingly. In addition to instructing the National Tariff Commission to consider and revise the tariffs during the revision of the tariffs to maintain the interests of overseas Chinese merchants, we have also issued instructions to inform you.' We are sending this letter to inform you. Please check and comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Railways</h3>
<p>Issue of Affixing Stamps to Delivery Orders</p>
<p>The Traffic Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administrations yesterday notified all station managers: "It has been found that the case of exempting railway delivery orders from stamp tax was previously notified in a circular from this department on August 4 of this year. Recently, the Railway Administration issued a telegram from the Ministry of Railways, stating that the Ministry of Finance had repeatedly sent officials to the Ministry to negotiate and consult on the case of exempting railway delivery orders from stamp tax. The result was that the Ministry agreed to forward the Ministry of Finance's consultation to the railway, but stated that the railway cannot handle or assist in affixing stamps to delivery orders. Stamp tax officials are not allowed to use the railway's offices to conduct business, and the railway bureau does not need to order merchants to affix stamps. If the stamp tax bureau uses other methods to make merchants affix stamps, the railway bureau does not need to interfere. Please inform the Traffic Department accordingly." Furthermore, Instruction No. 4913 from the Financial Department states: "For compliance matters, the Ministry of Finance's consultation states that the consultation from your ministry regarding the case of exempting delivery orders from stamp tax on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus has been copied and sent to each railway for compliance. It is difficult to change the instructions. The current temporary regulations on stamp tax, which have been decided by the Central Political Council, stipulate that stamps should be affixed to delivery orders. Merchants on both railways have been following these regulations for a long time without any objections. It seems inappropriate to suddenly stop it. We are consulting your ministry again to ask you to inform the railways and request a reply." The Ministry of Finance consulted on the aforementioned reasons, and the Ministry of Railways consulted on the issuance of stamps to merchants and the railway bureau should not interfere. This order is issued for compliance. The current stamp tax law is too harsh and detailed, causing hardship to merchants. It has been heard that knowledgeable people will take this opportunity to make suggestions.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>Reactions to Tendering for Fushun Coal</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: "The Procurement Committee of the Ministry of Railways previously published an advertisement for the purchase of national coal and notified coal merchants to bid. After reading the newspaper, the National Coal Production and Sales Joint Association of the Republic of China in this city sent a letter to the Procurement Committee, requesting it to forward the matter to the Ministry of Railways and find a way to allocate cars to transport national coal out of the mines to promote its application. The Coal Association then received a reply from the Procurement Committee stating that it could be handled according to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways. Yesterday, local newspapers in this city again published an advertisement from the Procurement Committee of the Ministry of Railways tendering for Fushun coal. It is found that the Fushun Coal Mine is located about six miles east of Tieling Province. The mine area is about 30 miles long from east to west and about 6 miles wide from north to south. It was occupied by the Japanese army on April 1, 1907, and was later transferred to the South Manchuria Railway Company for operation. Its scale and architecture are unmatched by any other mine in China. Our country has suffered countless losses. It is unexpected that the Procurement Committee is advertising for the purchase of Fushun coal operated by the Japanese, abandoning national coal and using foreign coal. It has been heard that the Joint Association will write to the Procurement Committee to stop tendering for Fushun coal and earnestly promote national coal to prevent leakage."</p>

<h3>Doctors Suffer Multiple Robberies</h3>
<p>Lu Mujun is Scared and Extorted</p>
<p>Meeting Agreed Upon on Yuanfang Road, Hongkou</p>
<p>Victim Must Carry a Newspaper as a Signal</p>
<p>Detectives Disguise Themselves and Ambush in Secret</p>
<p>Thief Falls and is Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where people from all over gather, and good and bad are mixed together. Therefore, kidnappings, robberies, and strange cases occur frequently. Although the military and police authorities are strictly investigating, the bandits are numerous and cunning. Even kidnapping cases occur almost daily, so that those with modest wealth are often the target of extortion. The other day, the famous doctor Zhu Ziyun was kidnapped in Hongkou. Unexpectedly, Lu Mujun, a pediatrician in Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, was also threatened with extortion. Lu has many patients every day and his income is quite good. His spending has also increased accordingly. A month ago, he received an anonymous letter from extortionists with strong wording, wanting to borrow 3,000 yuan in cash and arrange to meet in a certain place in the French Concession. Lu did not respond because he did not have enough money at the time. Recently, he received another letter from the bandits with a strong tone, saying that they would not give up until they achieved their goal, otherwise they would resort to the final means and put Lu to death. However, the letter did not contain a meeting place, and Lu laughed it off. Unexpectedly, another letter arrived the other day, urging Lu not to be stubborn and not to report it to the police, and agreeing to a meeting place on Yuanfang Road, Xi'an Road, Hongkou. They agreed to meet at 5:00 PM yesterday and instructed him to carry a newspaper in his hand. After receiving the letter, Lu Mujun had no way to deal with it, so he reported it to the Zhabei Police Station and requested them to arrest the bandits. The police chief learned that kidnapping and extortion cases had been emerging one after another recently, and the bandits dared to agree on a meeting place in broad daylight and set a time limit for paying the money. If they were not investigated, Shanghai, which claims to be a civilized area, would be uninhabitable. He immediately ordered detectives Chen Ruhai, Qiu Sijiu, Ye Yuxi, and Weng Hongxun to disguise themselves as best they could and go with Lu's representative, an old man, to wait on Yuanfang Road in Hongkou. On one side, the representative held the newspaper and stood on the road. The detectives were lurking in a nearby small hotel. After a while, a young man wandered on the road, apparently sent by the bandits to make contact. However, he did not meet with Lu's representative. The detectives had to let him go. Later, seeing that there was no one around, the young man waved to the old man, signaling him to come and negotiate in the alley. He said that it was raining today and they had sent him to talk. Seeing this situation, the detectives knew that the man was definitely not a good person. For the sake of serious public duty, they ignored the rain and the slippery road and bravely rushed up. Fearing that he would be caught, the bandit tried to escape desperately. The four detectives, Chen, Qiu, Ye, and Weng, gave chase at the risk of their lives. At the turn, the bandit lacked racing experience and fell. The detectives immediately caught him and brought him back to the police station. According to his confession, his name is Tang Linsheng, he is only 19 years old, and his native place is Wuxi. He is currently being held in the police station. The detectives are still investigating his accomplices so that they can be handed over to the court for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>An Old Woman Greedily Watches a Ship</h3>
<p>Tragically Run Over by a Car and Killed</p>
<p>An Old Woman from the Countryside Comes to Shanghai to Burn Incense</p>
<p>The Gods Do Not Protect Her, and She Dies Tragically</p>
<p>An old woman from the countryside in Suzhou, surnamed Mei Zhang, about 40 years old, recently accompanied a dozen neighboring women on a boat to Shanghai to burn incense to seek divine protection. They arrived in Shanghai on the 15th. The next morning (the 16th), they went to the City God Temple to burn incense. They planned to go to Longhua and then take a detour to Pudong. Walking out of the city, passing the French Concession Xiaodongmen Police Station, the women, having never been to Shanghai, admired the prosperity of the city. They stopped on the Huangpu Bund Road to watch the ships in the Huangpu River with fascination. A cargo truck of a certain company was driving by, and the old woman Mei was unable to avoid it and was hit, injuring her leg. The police took the injured person and the car to Renji Hospital. Due to the severity of the injury, the treatment was ineffective, and she died the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. It was heard that the driver of the car fled the scene. The police have ordered detectives to investigate. The family of the deceased was notified by their companions in the countryside and came to Shanghai yesterday to report to the Vehicle Management Office to await an autopsy today.</p>
<h3>Honey Exports Flourish</h3>
<p>In recent years, the beekeeping industry in our country has developed rapidly thanks to the promotion of a few people. As a result, honey exports are also increasing day by day. According to a recent survey, from January to August of this year, a total of more than 30,800 boxes, totaling more than 527,000 yuan, were transported from various places to Moji, Japan, for transshipment to various places.</p>
<h3>German Merchant Shi Lehuai Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>The Great Beauty Evening News reports: "German cotton exporter Shi Lehuai has an office in the Peace Foreign Firm at No. 4 Beijing Road. He usually arrives at the office at 7:00 AM to work. Today (the 22nd), he had not arrived at the office by 7:30 AM. The staff suspected something was wrong and sent someone to his residence on Fuzhou Road to check. He was found dead in the bathroom with a gunshot wound to the head. A pistol was left beside him. Shi was about 40 years old. According to his friends, he had been living alone in Shanghai for the past few years and had been unusually depressed recently. He died in the bathroom, and the door was tightly locked until the patrolmen arrived and broke down the door. It is clearly a suicide. His body will be inspected by the Special District Court tomorrow before being coffined and buried. He left behind a wife who is currently living in Germany. His assets in Shanghai have been temporarily managed by Mr. Jun Quhuofu, appointed by the German Consulate."</p>
<h3>Rice Prices are Gradually Falling</h3>
<p>Recently, the rice markets in the north and south of this city have seen a gradual increase in the supply of new japonica rice, and market prices have gradually fallen. Yesterday, the selling prices in the northern market fell due to the increasing amount of river accumulation and sluggish sales. Top grade broken rice was priced at 19.30 yuan per picul and 19 yuan. West new rice was priced at 19.60 yuan per picul, and Bian rice was priced at 18.50 yuan per picul, a decrease of 4 or 5 cents compared to the previous day. According to people in the rice industry, at this time of transition between the old and new crops, the supply of goods has gradually increased. With abundant harvests in various villages, it is expected that the market price will gradually fall. As a result, the general public is overjoyed.</p>
<h3>Friend's Voice Society</h3>
<p>The Result of Promoting Walking</p>
<p>The Friend's Voice Travel Society of this city has spared no effort in promoting various kinds of travel on weekdays. Recently, in view of the great benefits of walking to physical and mental health, it organized a Friend's Voice Hiking Team. The last long-distance hike to Kunshan was of great interest to the participants, but it was temporarily suspended due to the heat of summer being unsuitable for long trips. Now that the autumn is high and the air is crisp, the healthy walking team members are eager to try to see their progress, so they decided to walk to Songjiang on the 21st of this month. More than 23 people joined. It was agreed that they would gather at the North Station at 4:45 in the morning and depart at 5:00. Later, because the team members were not all there, the departure was temporarily changed to 5:10. All those who signed up participated without delay. The stationmaster signed and certified that they were full of energy and high spirits all the way. The stationmasters at each station also signed and certified. The first people to arrive at Xin Zhuang Station were Zhou Yu Yu, Hou Gen Ren, and Wang Ming Zhi, at 8:30. They took a short rest next to the station. The other team members also arrived one after another. When the clock struck nine, they continued on their way. However, south of this point, the road was mostly paved with bricks and stones, and the sunlight was also strong. The team members were sweating and walking quickly, and many had broken shoes and toes, which was very difficult. However, they were all brave and unconcerned. The staff in the team took a slow train to greet them, sticking their heads out of the window to observe and record the journey. At 11:25, Hou Gen Ren was the first to arrive in Songjiang, looking energetic and not tired at all. If he had not been well-trained, how could he have achieved this and set a record and won the championship? Then, Wang Mingzhi arrived and won the second place. Cai Songyan arrived and won the third place. Subsequently, Cao Qiyun, Mao Wenjie, Zhou Yuyu, and Lin Yuting arrived one after another. Finally, all the team members arrived, so they took a short break, had a meal, and went out to play together. At 8 o'clock, they took a train back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Meeting Minutes of the Kangzang Hiking Team</h3>
<p>Since the Kangzang Hiking Team moved to No. 7, Lianzhi Lane, Baoshan Road, the team's work has been progressing rapidly. Yesterday, the association held a team meeting. The chairman, Zhang Yuan, said that the team's personnel had been determined and that the document would be submitted to Beijing in the near future. Half of the team members should remain at the office to serve. Before departure, please seriously examine your own bodies and all your hobbies. You should also practice walking. You should especially study all books about Tibet. Wang Jin Yuan proposed that in the past two days, one or two comrades have not been serving because of family affairs or worldly matters, which is a great obstacle to the team. Because the trip will last two years, trekking through thousands of miles of deep mountains and swamps, wilderness and jungles, everything will be different. They have not yet set off, but they already show the feelings of children. It is appropriate to announce that everyone must report for service before the 24th of this month. Otherwise, they will be considered to have withdrawn and substitute reserve team members will be added to facilitate the team's work. The entire body approved. Mr. Wang also said that although the selection of personnel is complete, people are still sending letters and applying for membership in an endless stream. Moreover, the letters are full of people who are determined and courageous. It is not possible to reject them simply because the quota is full. A satisfactory method should be used to respond to them. It was decided to temporarily retain them for further decision. They also studied the order of the steps to be taken. The meeting adjourned at half past five.</p>
<h3>Swindling after Liang Shuxian's Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Claiming to be an Adjutant, Finally Arrested</p>
<p>Liang Shuxian, the chief revenue and expenditure officer of the Two-Roads Management Bureau, absconded without a trace after embezzling 200,000 yuan of public funds. Up to now, he has disappeared without a trace and has not yet been captured. At that time, the Two-Roads Police Investigation Office offered a reward of 3,000 yuan to capture him as soon as possible. Last Wednesday, a soldier in military uniform suddenly came to visit the office and asked what was the matter. He claimed to be an adjutant of a certain department in the capital. Because he had learned that Liang Shuxian was currently living in a certain place in the capital, he could lead the arrest. His description was vivid and seemed quite certain. At that time, he also wanted to collect the 3,000 yuan reward immediately. However, the staff of the office did not allow it because the fugitive had not yet been captured. The office dispatched Deputy Chief Investigator Fan Chaolan to make the arrest. After Fan received the order, he immediately accompanied Li to the capital by car and temporarily stayed at a certain hotel. At that time, in order to be cautious, he first ordered Li to investigate the matter thoroughly in order to catch him in one fell swoop. However, Li seemed to have complete confidence. He stayed at the hotel, talking and laughing freely. He required very expensive meals for every meal to eat his fill. Fan, for the sake of arresting the important criminal, also allowed him to eat. After two days in the remote inn, Li still did not mention the matter. Fan was quite suspicious of him. When he asked when he could go to arrest him, Li did not hesitate and went out with Fan, saying that he could catch him in one fell swoop immediately. When passing a certain headquarters in the capital, Li suddenly said to Fan that a friend of his was now working here and wanted to meet him. Please wait a moment. Fan believed him and stood by the door. Unexpectedly, after Li entered the door, he was never seen going out. When he asked the soldiers by the door if there was such a person as a certain adjutant, they denied it. Thereupon Fan was very suspicious and immediately told the matter. He searched for Li in the headquarters, but he had already left through the back door. At this point, he knew that he had been deceived without a doubt. Crestfallen, he returned to Shanghai, intending to report to the office. Who knew that something unexpected happened? Li, who claimed to be an adjutant, also arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. As soon as he arrived at the North Station, he hurriedly went out and was spotted by Fan. It was a narrow road for enemies. He was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. He claimed that he had intended to defraud, but he had not received the 3,000 yuan reward in advance, so the original plan had not been fulfilled. This arrest was really due to the long arm of the law, he said.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhanen</h3>
<p>Extortion Case Tried Yesterday</p>
<p>Dr. Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai University, was recently threatened by gangsters in a letter. It was reported in the newspapers that after Liu received the threatening letter, he reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation because the school was located in the Chinese territory. Unexpectedly, on the 19th, he received another letter from the gangsters, scheduling a meeting at the Central Hotel on Hubei Road on the afternoon of the previous day, and asking Liu to book a room and fill in the name "Huang Zhongxia" on the hotel's guest list for easy access. Liu immediately sent the original letter to the Public Security Bureau and sent Chen Zhizhang to the Central Hotel to book two rooms, No. 310 and No. 314. The bureau also sent a certain patrol leader to the General Patrol Room to request assistance, and then accompanied the Chinese and foreign detectives of the General Inspection Office, Liu Shaokui and Baideng, and the detective Pang Ruiqing to wait in room 310. After a while, a person wandered around the entrance of room 314 and suddenly disappeared. Not long after, Chen received a phone call. After questioning each other, they learned that it was from the gangsters, who said that it was very inappropriate to negotiate in the Central Hotel and asked them to move to the Pingqiao Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to negotiate. Everyone realized that the person wandering in the room was a gangster scout. Chen immediately went to Pingqiao with the Chinese and foreign detectives. When passing the intersection of Hubei Road and Guangdong Road, they encountered the gangster scout and captured him on the spot. After questioning, they learned that his name was Zhou A'mao. They also took him to Pingqiao and ordered Zhou to write to verify the handwriting of the threatening letter. They felt that they were very similar. Later, because no gangsters arrived until the evening, they took Zhou to the police station and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for trial by President Zhou Hanting. The lawyer of the police station, Ru Baoyi, stated that although the plaintiff lived in the Chinese territory, the defendant was arrested in the concession, so the court could also accept the case. If the Public Security Bureau insisted on transferring the case, he requested the court to verify it, etc. The plaintiff, Liu Zhanen, did not arrive, and his wife, Ms. Wang Liming, represented him in court. She stated that she had received a threatening letter and reported it to the Public Security Bureau, and sent someone to the hotel to find out what happened. President Zhou questioned the defendant, who completely denied sending the letter of extortion. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and the trial adjourned to another day.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Kidnapper</h3>
<p>Chen Baolin Arrested in Shanghai</p>
<p>Handed over to the Hangzhou Detective Team Leader to be brought back</p>
<p>Chen Baolin (Chen Damao) from Jiangbei was involved in a kidnapping and ransom case in Hangzhou on May 24 of this year. He fled after the incident. Recently, the Public Security Bureau of Zhejiang Province arrested his younger brother, Chen Ermao, who confessed that his brother was hiding in the Wuzhou Hotel on Guangdong Road in the Shanghai Public Concession. The director prepared a document and specially sent Tang Shifu, the leader of the first detective team, to Shanghai. He went to the Yizhou Hotel to investigate, but Damao had gone out and was not seen. At 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, Damao was walking near the corner of the old Garbage Bridge North Pier. The patrol police station in charge of the area sent many detectives to inspect the area and saw that Damao's appearance was suspicious. They searched him and found many pawn tickets on his body. After questioning at the police station, they learned that he was a major bandit wanted by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and arrested him. Tang, the team leader, was still reporting to the superiors when he learned that Chen had been arrested. He went to the police station to confirm that it was correct. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Chen to the Special District Local Court. Tang also went to the court to submit an official letter requesting the transfer of the case. Judge Wu then ordered the bandit to be brought to court for questioning. According to his confession, he used to be an accomplice of Shi Zhizhong, a detective of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau. One day, Shi suddenly brought a child and asked me to hide him. I have not committed any other crimes, etc. Judge Wu concluded the preliminary trial and handed Chen over to Tang to be brought back to Hangzhou to be tried.</p>
<h3>Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>Robbery of More Than Ten Thousand Gold</p>
<p>At about 3 p.m. yesterday, four robbers suddenly came to No. 1599, Avenue Edward VII, in the Public Concession. Two robbers, armed with pistols, threatened and intimidated the owner of the house and the servants into being imprisoned in a room. The robbers then searched the house at will for about half an hour before carrying away the loot and fleeing far away. It is estimated that the loss of jewelry, gold and silver, and clothing amounted to more than ten thousand yuan. The owner of the house immediately reported the loss to the police station and asked them to investigate.</p>
<h3>Clerk of Section Chief</h3>
<p>Stealing Gold to Spend Lavishly in Shanghai</p>
<p>Redeemed a Prostitute for 800 Gold</p>
<p>Deposited 1,000 Yuan in the Bank of China</p>
<p>Liu Jisheng (also known as Zhang Huanwen), a servant of Cai Zhe, the section chief of a certain agency in Anhui Province, stole his master's passbook on the 5th of this month and secretly withdrew 2,800 yuan to escape to Shanghai to gamble and prostitute. He became inextricably linked with Wang Yueqin, a prostitute at No. 29, Qinghe Lane, and redeemed her for 800 gold to rent the surplus room at No. 310, Guangdong Road, and lived together. He also bought gold watches and gold rings as gifts. Liu had only been in Shanghai for ten days, but he had already spent 1,800 yuan. He deposited the remaining 1,000 yuan in the Bank of China. Cai learned of Liu's whereabouts and took a boat from Anhui to Shanghai and reported it to the Old Gate Police Station. The police station sent people to arrest Liu and the prostitute Wang together and found a gold watch, three gold rings, a thousand yuan passbook from the Bank of China, and 62 yuan of unused cash. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court. Cai also came to court and requested to be allowed to take the servant back to Anqing for trial. After President Zhou questioned him, he ordered the two defendants to be detained separately and the trial adjourned to another day.</p>
<h3>Still Walking on the Streets Late at Night</h3>
<p>A Pistol Found on His Person</p>
<p>Detained at the Police Station for Investigation</p>
<p>A man named Qin Hengheng, who claimed to be a doctor and lived on Difeng Road in West Shanghai, was still walking on the road at 4:15 a.m. yesterday when the east was just beginning to dawn. When Qin was walking to the intersection of Menala Road and Danshui Road, Chinese and foreign detectives from the New Gate Police Station passed by on patrol and checked him. They found a self-loading pistol with five live rounds on Qin's body and took him to the police station for questioning. He confessed that he did not have a gun license. At 9:30, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for trial by Judge Wu. According to Qin, he had previously encountered bandits on the way and robbed him of two pieces of clothing. He began to carry a pistol with him for self-defense, but he did not register it. He also stated his address and occupation. Judge Wu ordered him to be detained at the New Ang Police Station to investigate whether his confession was true and whether he had committed any crimes. The trial was adjourned for seven days.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Transporting Military Supplies Exposed</h3>
<p>Three Mauser Pistols</p>
<p>Five Browning Pistols</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Public Concession Bureau detectives Xu Rongqi and Hai Tian received a secret report from an informant that many bandits were secretly transporting prohibited items to a certain place by rickshaw, please investigate thoroughly, etc. At about 3 p.m. yesterday, they went to various places to patrol. When they arrived near the Wanyu Wharf, they suddenly saw a rickshaw (No. 2327) pulled by a man coming towards them, looking flustered and suspicious. The detectives rushed forward and ordered him to stop. After checking, they found a rush bag under the cushion of the car. When they opened it, they found that all the items inside were military supplies, including three Mauser pistols, five Browning pistols, 500 bullets, and ten magazines. They took the rickshaw puller and the seized firearms together to Zhang Jichun, the guard of the eighth post in the area. When Director Xu of the first sub-station of the area interrogated the case, the rickshaw puller confessed that his name was Zhang Xuefu, 28 years old, from Tongzhou, living in the Xiecheng Rickshaw Company on Tongzhou Road in Beishi. A friend entrusted him to take the rush bag to a certain place, and he did not know that the military supplies were hidden inside, etc. Because the case involved privately transporting a large number of firearms, which violated the regulations, they ordered him to prepare a document and report the evidence to the third section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Involved in Lawsuit Limited Time for Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Qu Shunxiang and Zhou Jianren were fighting over an ancestral grave in the local court. During the court hearing, a lawyer insulted another lawyer. Gu Yongquan, the lawyer hired by Zhou, insulted Wang Chengkuan, the lawyer on Qu's side, in court as a disgrace to lawyers. Wang Chengkuan was still unwilling to give up and hired Tao Jiachun as his lawyer to file a private prosecution against Gu Yongquan for defamation with the criminal court of the court. Gu also hired Zou Yu as his lawyer to file a defense. A court hearing was held but no conclusion was reached. The court ordered the parties to reconcile out of court. As previously reported, it is learned that the case was continued yesterday morning in the third court specially opened by Judge Zhao. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, lawyer Zou claimed that the case was currently being mediated out of court and requested an adjournment, etc. Lawyer Tao also claimed that lawyer Zhang Zhengxue was currently acting as the mediator, and Wang Chengkuan's intention was that if Gu Yongquan had already realized his mistake, he would not go too far. If Gu requested an adjournment, Wang would also express his sympathy. Then, according to Wang Chengkuan, if Gu sincerely reconciled, the plaintiff would not object. According to Gu Yongquan, he originally intended to hire lawyer Zhang Zhengxue to appear in court to defend him and file a counterclaim. However, Zhang believed that it would be better to mediate the case out of court, so he was willing to come out and mediate, etc. The judge then ordered the two lawyers to reconcile out of court within a week, otherwise the trial would be continued and the case would be judged according to law, etc. After the judge finished speaking, he adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Son Sues Mother Case Hearing for Witnesses Continued Trial</h3>
<p>Ye Deming, a native of Tongzhou, recently hired lawyer Zhu Xiyun to sue his own mother, Ye Tao, in the local court for listening to slander and infringing on his freedom, requesting release, etc. The petition stated that his mother, listening to the slander of his sister-in-law's father, Tao Miaogan, etc., sent the plaintiff to the Songhu Reformatory on Song Park Road in Zhabei in March of this year for more than a month, and sold the Tongtaixing Velvet Line Shop on Xingsheng Street outside the New North Gate to Jin Yusong for 12,000 yuan, forcing the plaintiff to sign in order to be released. On the 8th of this month, the plaintiff was sent to the Caohejing Migrant Training Center for six months. Because of illness, he was sent to the New Puyu Hall for treatment. His mother, etc., infringed on the plaintiff's physical freedom, which was inappropriate. Please inform the Caohejing Migrant Training Center to release the plaintiff, etc. The defendant, Ye Tao, hired lawyer Ye Fukan to file a defense. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the second court for trial. The plaintiff, Ye Deming, did not arrive (he has now recovered from his illness and is still detained in the Migrant Training Center). Lawyer Zhu represented him in court and stated the intention of the lawsuit, requesting permission to be released, etc. According to the defendant, Ye Tao, 49 years old, from Tongzhou, living at No. 2, Yangjia Lane, Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, Ye Deming, the plaintiff, is my biological son, 23 years old this year. I have two sons and one daughter. The eldest son is Deming, the second son is only eight years old, and the daughter is seventeen years old. Deming got married on January 21 of the year before last. On February 29 of the same year, my husband died. However, Deming did not think about learning and smoking opium, gambling, and doing nothing. The first time was because he set fire at home, and the neighbors were dissatisfied, so I advocated asking the security team to send Deming to the Zhabei Reformatory for a month, hoping that he would repent. Unexpectedly, he still did not change and pawned all the clothes and bedding of his daughter-in-law (Deming's wife). He even snatched his daughter-in-law's pants and pawned them for money. I really have no way to manage him, etc. According to Tao Miaogan, 34 years old, living on Xihua Road, the testimony is the same as above. After lawyer Ye stated it once, the judge said to the defendant Ye Tao, "Today, the plaintiff has not arrived. We will wait for the investigation to see if the son has set fire and summon the witnesses to hold another hearing to verify and decide," and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Romantic Woman Hanged Herself</h3>
<p>Yang Guo, a woman from Hangzhou, was 28 years old. Her parents opened a mao bamboo shop in Hangzhou. She was still unmarried after her prime, so she had a passionate relationship with Yang Ruzeng, a Jinan man and a shop assistant. In the year before last, she was instigated by Yang to abscond. Ms. Yang was so infatuated that she took more than 1,000 yuan of valuables and fled with Yang to Shanghai, where they lived together happily like lovebirds and a united branch. Her parents swore never to recognize her because she had ruined the family's reputation. Ms. Yang only knew pleasure and did not think about her parents' kindness. However, Yang had no job and was just sitting around eating. When the money ran out, the pitiful couple rented a room in the Yongyu Yarn Factory workers' quarters at No. 27, Tanjiadu, West Shanghai. To make matters worse, they were recently involved in a lawsuit, which resulted in the loss of money and mental distress. As a result, they failed, and Yang Ruzeng was even more afraid of being implicated in the official business, so he abandoned Ms. Yang and fled. Ms. Yang was already in a desperate situation and had no choice but to commit suicide. She hanged herself the night before last. Her roommate discovered it and reported it to the Sixth District Police Station, which ordered the local bailiff to report it to the local court for inspection. The prosecutor confirmed that there were no family members, so the hall collected the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Man Who Took Poison in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>At around 9 o'clock last night, Chinese police car number 927 from the Jing'an Temple Police Station sent a man, about 40 years old, wearing a striped cloth shirt and pants, a black Yangzhigong wool long gown, white socks, black shoes, and a shaved head, unconscious and barely breathing, to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was confirmed that he had taken opium poison. Injections and medications were given to try to save him, but his life was in great danger.</p>

<p>All Died of Illness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office received a report from the Sixteenth Pier that a passenger, about 40 years old, from Chongming, had died on the Hongxing steamboat bound for Chongming.

The Pier also reported that a young man, about 20 years old, died at the Dada No. 3 Wharf at noon today. He was a poor man with no family and unknown name. The Land Bailiff of the Twenty-fifth Bao and Twelfth Ward reported that a man had come to the Nan City Tram Company begging during the day and sleeping in the iron pipe of the water company at night. This morning, a supervisor from the Public Security Bureau discovered the body in the water pipe, which was the same person. The Land Bailiff of the Twenty-third Bao and Sixteenth Ward reported that a male corpse was suddenly found in an empty house belonging to a certain surname in Qichang Stockade in Pudong. He was about 20 years old and his clothes were ragged, a typical image of a poor man in despair. The above four cases were all inspected by Prosecutor Yang and the inspectors, who confirmed that they all died of illness and ordered the land bailiffs to collect the bodies for burial.</p>

<h3>Japanese Man Detained for Taking a Pistol</h3>
<p>The Great America Evening News said that on the 17th of this month, the Japanese ship Kasaoki Maru arrived in Shanghai with several boxes of goods to be delivered to Takaoka, a Japanese merchant at No. 76, Desiewei Road. The goods were unloaded and declared by the Imamura Transport Company. On the 20th, a Japanese man named Shiotani went to the customs warehouse to pick up the goods.

<h3>Transportation Companies Must be Inspected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Police Office issued a notice yesterday and posted it at the South Station, which stated that there are dozens of transportation companies at the South Station. Most of them are law-abiding, but there are also some who seek profit and pervert the law. If strict inspections are not carried out, the root causes cannot be eradicated. In addition to ordering the police detectives of this section to conduct strict investigations, a special notice is hereby issued to all transportation companies to abide by the following: In the future, when transporting goods, no matter the boxes, if they are suspicious, they must be inspected by the police detectives of this section before they can be loaded and transported. All companies must abide by this notice.</p>
<h3>Provisional Seizure of Zhang Huichong's Equipment</h3>
<p>Zhang Opposes and Demands Responsibility</p>
<p>Film actor and water escape magician Zhang Huichong was about to go to various ports in Nanyang to perform magic before being informed by creditors Zhong Caiji and Xie Qinglong that Zhang owed more than 1,300 yuan for ordering magic materials, 1,000 yuan for the salary of the Water Margin film shot by the Star Company, and 300 yuan advanced by the Tianyi Company, totaling more than 3,000 yuan. On the 13th of this month, he applied to the Fifth District and Second Sub-district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to notify the Baixing Grand Theater to detain all of Zhang's magic equipment, as reported in this newspaper. It is learned that the plaintiff's lawyer has now applied to the Shanghai Local Court to approve the seizure of all of Zhang Huichong's assets (referring to magic equipment) to offset the various debts. The court has approved the request. Yesterday, the court sent a process server to clarify Zhang's magic equipment and temporarily seal it up. However, Zhang believes that this equipment is necessary for performing magic and the current detention has caused considerable losses. He has also hired a lawyer to present reasons demanding that the plaintiff bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<h3>Opium on a Boat in Rihui Port</h3>
<p>More Than Fifty Taels</p>
<p>Shi Liangchen and other team members of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team were patrolling the river at the Rihui Bridge around 3 pm yesterday when they spotted a boat moored there. They inspected the boat and found two paper-wrapped packages hidden inside a small mesh basket in the cabin, which were about fifty taels of opium. The owner of the goods was detained, and the seized opium was brought back to the team. The team leader interrogated the owner, who confessed that his name was Chen Longsheng, 46 years old, from Qingpu, and his occupation was boating. The mesh basket was entrusted to him by Wang Arsheng, the brother of a man named Arer whom he knew, to take it to Qingpu and hand it over to a certain person. He did not know that the opium was hidden inside and was thus deceived. He asked for understanding. Because the case involved privately transporting prohibited items, he was ordered to prepare a document and report the evidence to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Please Prohibit the Abolished Lunar Calendar and Cessation of Work to Demand Compensation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the bookbinding industry workers, submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Citizens' Training Council regarding the voluntary cessation of work and demand for compensation during the abolished lunar calendar. The original petition stated: "Regarding the matter of how to abolish the automatic cessation of work and compensation for workers in the bookbinding industry during the abolished lunar New Year, we hereby request instructions. On the 20th of this month, the Shanghai Bookbinding Trade Association submitted a petition stating that members such as Wang Yuji had reported that national holidays and festivals have been officially designated as holidays for workers with wages paid as usual. Members have strictly complied with this, and workers receive appropriate treatment during national holidays. The lunar New Year festivals should be actively abolished. However, many workers do not understand the proper calendar and treat national holidays as an unexpected benefit to enjoy, while still insisting on cessation of work during the lunar festivals. During the Beginning of Summer, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and other festivals, they automatically cease work and demand banquets from employers (under the pretext of celebrating holidays). Around the 20th of the lunar December, workers again automatically cease work, pack their bags, and return home for the New Year, returning to work after the beginning of the lunar year. They insist on five days of feasting, otherwise causing disputes. Furthermore, the wages lost due to their unauthorized cessation of work during the lunar festivals cannot be deducted by employers. If this continues, employers will suffer losses twice, during both the national and lunar calendars. If this is not promptly rectified, it will only encourage such behavior, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. We request detailed instructions on how to rectify this matter so that we can follow them." The association investigated and found that workers' actions during the abolished lunar New Year, Beginning of Summer, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, New Year's Eve, and other festivals were indeed as described. Therefore, it submitted a petition to your council, requesting that you forward it to the municipal party headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for instructions, so that the Mid-Autumn Festival of the current abolished lunar calendar can be properly handled. The implementation of the national calendar and the handling of workers' holidays and wages have been clearly stipulated by the central government. All industrial and commercial labor-management parties should strictly comply and have no reason to use the abolished lunar calendar. The fact that bookbinding workers still automatically cease work and demand banquets during the abolished lunar Mid-Autumn Festival and other festivals is unreasonable. Therefore, we request your review and strict prohibition to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3>Please Increase Stevedore and Seamen's Salaries</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Association yesterday sent letters to various shipping companies and comprador groups in Shanghai, stating: "According to a report from our Shanghai branch, the stevedore offices of the China Merchants Bureau, the New Taikoo Jianghai Shipping Stevedore Club, the Liyi Xuan Dormitory, and the Yi'an Company Dormitory have reported that the monthly salaries of stevedores have been meager for a long time and have not been increased. With the current high cost of living, it is increasingly difficult to make ends meet. The aforementioned offices are preparing to appeal to your association to find a way to provide relief. It has been reported that stokers, stewards, and other seamen have already had their salaries increased by four yuan per month, starting from August 1st of this year, and another two yuan will be added from March 1st of the 20th year. Stevedores are also seamen and should receive the same treatment. Furthermore, the salaries of stevedores are even lower than those of stokers and stewards, so they should be given an increase as soon as possible to maintain their livelihood. Therefore, we jointly request that your association follow the example of the stokers, stewards, and other departments and strongly request that the capitalists increase the salaries of stevedores to avoid being left behind. We await your urgent instructions." After investigation, the association found that the reported meager monthly salaries and the current high cost of living making it difficult to make ends meet are indeed true. It is appropriate to increase their salaries. We request that you approve the case and negotiate with the capitalists to increase the salaries of stevedores to alleviate their difficulties and maintain their livelihood. The Shanghai stokers, stewards, and other seamen have indeed had their salaries increased through negotiations between our association and the Shanghai Shipping Association, and an agreement has been signed and distributed to various shipping companies for reference. The stevedores are also seamen, and due to the high cost of living and meager salaries, it is necessary to increase their salaries as well. Now, based on the aforementioned situation, in addition to sending separate letters, we also inform your company, hoping that you will investigate and convene your affiliated shipping compradors or appoint representatives to discuss increasing the salaries of stevedores to avoid bias. We look forward to your reply."</p>
<h3>American</h3>
<p>Dispute Over the New Plan for the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Proposed by Reverend Patton</p>
<p>Approved by the American Consul General</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reports that the Municipal Affairs Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce of this port, in view of the fact that only one American candidate was elected to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council this year due to the dispersal of votes among the four American candidates, has proposed a plan to have the American community conduct its own election before each election of the Board of Directors. If there are more than two candidates, a vote will be held to determine the two candidates with the most votes to be the publicly recommended American candidates for the Board of Directors. This plan was proposed by Reverend Patton, chairman of the committee, and was unanimously approved by the committee. It was then sent to various American organizations last week to solicit their consent. It is reported that five organizations have already responded with letters of support and willingness to be bound by it. If all seven American organizations agree, the opinions of individual Americans will be sought as the final decision. It is reported that American Consul General Cunningham has formally approved it, and it is expected that the majority of Americans in this port will also support it, believing that its implementation in the future will guarantee that Americans will steadily occupy two seats on the Board of Directors.</p>

Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 716 and the lowest was 685. On the same day last year, the highest was 874 and the lowest was 554.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Traveler</p>
<p>Female A: I often hear you say that you have no feelings for Mr. So-and-so, and sometimes you even dislike him.</p>
<p>Female B: Yes, that's really how I feel.</p>
<p>Female A: But how could you agree to marry him?</p>
<p>Female B: That day, during a heavy thunderstorm, we were walking in the countryside together. He had an umbrella, but I didn't. He took this opportunity to propose. If I didn't agree, he wouldn't give me the umbrella, and my new velvet qipao would be ruined. So I had to agree to him.</p>
<p>Beggar: Madam, can you help me out with three cents so that my family can reunite?</p>
<p>Charitable Madam (gives him three cents): Poor man. These three cents can certainly help. But where are your family members stranded?</p>
<p>Beggar: Thank you, madam. They are at the Great World Amusement Park watching a civilized drama, waiting for me to go.</p>
<p>Customer in a Dim Sum Restaurant (wipes his face and shows the towel to the waiter): Friend, your towels are too dirty.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes about Tan Yankai's Visit to Mount Xiqiao</h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>Mount Xiqiao is located in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province. It is more than a hundred miles away from Guangzhou and its scenery is the best in the province. To the east is the East River, and to the west is Mount Guan. The terrain is magnificent. Numerous peaks and ridges rise thousands of feet. The top of the mountain is flat, and many hermits live here. The villages are well-organized, and farming, wood gathering, and fishing are like on the plains. It is nothing less than a paradise. There are seventy-two peaks on the mountain and the White Cloud Cave below. Following the cave, one finds the Yunquan Immortal Hall. In front of the hall is Yingchao Lake. A few steps away from the lake is the Sanhu Academy, as well as other pavilions. The lush forests and tall bamboos are secluded and elegant. Tan Zu'an, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, was in Guangdong at the time and admired the beauty of this mountain. He hired a steamer from the provincial capital and went to visit with several staff members. Climbing high peaks, looking far into the rivers and seas, they all praised it as a great spectacle. At the foot of the mountain is a waterfall. Clear springs gurgle down from the mountain peak, like white silver pouring down the ground, called the Winding Water Stream. Visitors come to the front and face the thousand-foot waterfall. The fresh air cleanses all worldly thoughts. Mr. Tan experienced it all. He lingered for several days before returning home with satisfaction. His footprints added another scenic spot to this mountain. Its name should be more famous. It is comparable to the Baiyun Mountain in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, which is often enjoyed by Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. However, the scenery of Mount Xiqiao surpasses Baiyun. This is why Mr. Tan enjoys climbing. Recently, it has been heard that Mr. Tan has been troubled by a slight illness and is not as healthy as before. It is not known whether he still has the leisure to climb mountains.</p>
<h3>A Record of Seeing the Buddha in Illusion Cottage</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>After the autumn rain, the morning was quiet in the small room. My friend Shen Zihuanlu came to visit. As soon as he sat down, he said, "We have been friends for a year, but I have not yet visited my cottage. I have already asked my wife to prepare some food. Can you join us for half a day?" I happily agreed and asked if there were other guests. He said, "Living in Shanghai is narrow and cannot accommodate many guests. And it is not easy to invite guests." Then we drove to southern Shanghai. The neighborhood was remote and free from the noise of the city. We knocked on the door and entered the room. A Buddha statue was seen facing us. The Buddha was sitting in a red robe with his eyes lowered and his palms together. The painting style was simple and ancient, with the artistic intention of 玉壺 [Jade Pot]. A short plaque hanging above said "Illusion Cottage." Upon closer inspection, both the calligraphy and painting were done by Huanlu, and the Buddha was Huanlu's self-portrait. Huanlu's other signature was 釋伽尊者 [Sakyamuni]. Now I knew his intention. His wife, Ms. Lu Shichou, led out their two sons to meet us. She served us Longjing tea and tiger claw bamboo shoots. Huanlu called his eldest son to show off his skills. The young man, who was just seven years old, clenched his fists and showed his claws, performing a monkey fist single strike. It was lively and agile, and quite impressive. I was very surprised. Then we set the table and sat down. After a small drink, we started the meal. There were not many dishes, but they were all light and delicious. The white-cut chicken and lotus leaf-wrapped meat were especially good. After the meal, we sipped bitter tea and were led to the east wing. The room was filled with bookshelves, and there were bronze tripods with mottled patterns. I almost didn't know where I was. Huanlu then took out his collection of calligraphy, paintings, and bronzes to feast my eyes. There was also a kind of album on the bookshelf. I asked to read it. Huanlu said, "It is not worth seeing." Mrs. Shichou also smiled. I was curious and took it myself. It was a silk book with fine brushwork, with twelve pages in total. Every page was a Buddha, and every page was Huanlu. Sometimes he was wearing luxurious clothes and gesturing imperiously, sometimes he was shaking his knees and looking like a poor scholar, sometimes he was wearing formal clothes and riding in a golden carriage, with followers crowding around him. Sometimes he looked disheveled, sitting outside a broken temple, with a bamboo basket beside him, wearing a tattered coat. What was even more strange was that he suddenly conjured up a scene from the Kunqu opera 跪池 [Kneeling by the Pool]. His wife was dressed as 季常 [Ji Chang] and Huanlu was in a lion's roar posture. I laughed and said, "Madam is beautiful and pure. It is not fitting for you to be 季常. You are as beautiful as someone from the north of the city, and you don't look like a shrew from Hedong. Perhaps the inside story is the opposite." Everyone laughed heartily. The last page was a bright moon in the sky, surrounded by white clouds. There was nothing else. I clasped my hands and said, "Everything, poverty and prosperity, fame and obscurity, greed, anger, ignorance, and love, all return to stillness. Huanlu is indeed the incarnation of the Buddha. He is indeed Sakyamuni, coming into the world to save people." His eldest son chimed in, saying that his father could still do Shaolin boxing. Huanlu stopped him from speaking. However, from the dance of the little phoenix in the morning, I already knew that Huanlu had good skills. At sunset, I bid farewell and returned home. I meditated for a long time and wrote a record of seeing the Buddha in Illusion Cottage.</p>
<h3>Half a Day on a Yacht</h3>
<p>— Lin Zhipeng</p>
<p>It has been ten years since I came to Shanghai. I should have traveled to all the great sights. However, I am even more ignorant than the people in my hometown. Because I am quiet by nature, I am disgusted by all the theaters, singing houses, and other extravagant places that people like to go to. Moreover, when I was young, I was burdened with my studies and had no time to travel. When I grew up a little, I learned to be a businessman and was trapped by the details of business. I did not get to travel. Now, I have changed my job to the Shanghai Reclamation Bank. The official duties are even more numerous than before. Although I have one day off on Sunday, I am burdened by public and private matters. Therefore, I am even more restless and have no time to travel. One day in September, the second issue of the "中華圖畫雜誌" [China Pictorial Magazine] was about to be published. Mr. Wang Dafo came up with the idea of ​​aquatic propaganda. It was planned to put a sign on the 麥墾 [wheat垦] boat that he had set up. The sign said, "The second issue of the "中華圖畫雜誌" [China Pictorial Magazine] will be published on a certain day." The boat went south to Dongjiadu and north to Yangshupu. The boat traveled slowly along the Bund so that the viewers on both sides could see it. It was decided that Mr. Chen Heqing would be responsible for the preparation. Mr. Yuan Mingshan, a calligrapher from Siming, wrote the plaque. Everything was completed. Mr. Wang invited me and said, "Although the event is propaganda for "中華圖畫雜誌" [China Pictorial Magazine], can we also take a half-day tour?" I happily agreed. At that time, Mr. Wang's mother and wife had just come to Shanghai. His wife had given birth a month ago and also brought her children and servants with her. Mr. Chen Heqing also arrived. Mr. Wang then brought a camera, two musical instruments, several bottles of flowers, a wet cell, and countless small light bulbs. He ordered the chef to prepare fruits, food, wine, and dishes. We traveled together. A group of more than ten people set off one after another by car. Arriving at the sampan factory and machine ship, we saw the sign hanging high in the cabin from a distance. The characters were as big as buckets and the brushstrokes were strong. The numbers of the "中華圖畫雜誌" [China Pictorial Magazine] fluttered in the wind, as if they were about to fly into the sky and surround the country. The wheat垦 boat was large enough to hold dozens of people and was about three feet long from end to end. The width was almost one zhang. The front of the cabin was surrounded by short railings and covered with brocade felt, so that you could enjoy the view. In the middle of the cabin, there were desks and chairs. Going down the ladder, there was a small door that could pass through. Next to the door, there was a gun rack that could be guarded. The inside was equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and bedding. The wires were connected to small light bulbs. Connecting to the current, the entire boat was bright. There were small windows on the sides of the hull, with potted flowers hanging in them. The flowers swayed when the boat moved. At 2:00 PM, we untied the cables and passed through the Baidu Bridge. There were streetcars passing by above, and the sound of the tracks rumbled. Listening to it under the bridge, it was like ten thousand thunders roaring together. We stopped briefly by the Bund Park and then went out to sea. At that time, the autumn wind was strong and the river was turbulent. Huge waves hit the hull of the boat, causing a great shock. Mr. Wang's mother and wife came out to the front cabin to watch the sails rise and fall in the sea. The only people sitting in the cabin were Mr. Wang, Mr. Chen, and me. Then, some played silk and bamboo instruments, some played the musical instrument, leaning on the railing and looking out, and singing loudly, in harmony with the sound of the waves outside the boat. Looking out from the cabin, the buildings on the Bund were lined up like ridges, surrounding the boat. The customs, HSBC, Sassoon buildings, and other buildings were high and reached into the clouds, like strange peaks rising up, standing thousands of feet tall. I suspected that I was in the mountains and rivers. I said that the land value in Shanghai is expensive, with high buildings stacked on top of each other, and dust like fog. If I could live on this boat with two or three friends and sing on the sea, I would be willing to spend my old age here. We clapped our hands together. At that time, the boat was already under the statue of peace. The waves in the river were even bigger and the current was even faster. The boat swayed and could hardly move forward. So we docked on the side. I heard that the customs clock had already reported 4:00 PM. It was still far from Dongjiadu. Fearing that it was already late, we did not want to go again. So we ordered the boatman to return. The chef had already brought out the cups and plates, and arranged the wine and dishes in the front half of the cabin. The three of us sat opposite each other, drinking and talking. Before we knew it, we had stopped by the park again. A round jade plate was hidden on the right side of the Bund. Smoke from cooking rose from the boat, winding up. The lights on the side were all bright, reflecting in the water like a string of beads. It was dusk. Mr. Wang then came out of the front cabin to take several evening scenes, which would be used for the "中華圖畫雜誌" [China Pictorial Magazine]. He also took photos of everyone as a souvenir. He ordered the boat to be parked back where it was and then returned. Counting the course of the boat that day, it was less than half of the scheduled journey. But the passers-by on the shore, seeing the boat, stopped to watch. We can say that we have fulfilled our responsibility for the publicity of China. We were able to take a half-day trip on the river. Although we were unable to travel through the Five Lakes and float on the vast sea, we have been far away from the dust of the city. Where can I get a boat of floating life and often travel in the vastness of heaven and earth?</p>
<h3>Listening to Chen Delin's Records</h3>
<p>— Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>In the past, the best performers of Qingyi roles, such as Hu Xilu, Xiao Fuzi, Yu Ziyun, etc., I was born too late to have ever seen them. I often listen to Chen Delin. Her voice is as round and smooth as an oriole singing in the imperial garden, or a warbler chirping amidst green willows. You don't even need to listen to the words, just listening to the sound is enough to dispel worries and anxieties. This is because she achieved the sound of harmony. Silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as the human voice, this is truly the case. From then on, Qingyi roles underwent a transformation. Transformation is certainly a step forward, but the original recordings and original rubbings are enough to prove the traces of this transformation and are therefore even more valuable. Now that Chen Delin is dead, we can only listen to her through opera records. Yesterday, I listened to Gao Ting Company's records of Chen singing "Filial Piety Moves Heaven," "Matching the Embroidered Ball," "Filial Piety and Righteousness," and "Hong Ni Guan." These are models of the past, extraordinary in every way. The sorrow and freshness each have their own unique charm. Accompanied by Sun Laoyuan's erhu, they can be called a perfect pair. Sun is already in his seventies and is the best in the erhu profession. His erhu's clear, firm, and loud tone is unmatched. Listening to it in the records, it is just like the harmonious and resounding sounds of phoenix flutes and luan reeds. His skill is divine. Of Chen's four operas, "Hong Ni Guan" and "Matching the Embroidered Ball" are the best. The same goes for the erhu. They are extremely fine works.</p>
<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (56)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>I have also often seen tortoise A climbing on the back of tortoise B, and tortoise B either acknowledges it or not. Sometimes tortoise B avoids it. Generally, it is the male seeking the female. There is also no jealousy from a third party. It is like when I lived in the Taiyuan Museum and observed several thousand pigeons. I observed them countless times. The male and female, pigeon A and pigeon B, pair up within the flock. The other pigeons are on the side as if they are unaware. How is this as fierce as naked insects fighting for wind and killing each other? From this perspective, the tortoise's few desires and lack of contention in terms of food, drink, and male-female relationships are no wonder they are great masters of Eastern philosophy of Yi.</p>
<p>Readers may suspect that I am being trivial with these words. This is a big mistake. I hope readers will focus on examining the logic behind all animal fights to learn from them for human society. Adopt what is appropriate and avoid what is inappropriate. In the past, Darwin sailed for five years, and as a result, his report established the theory of survival of the fittest, which caused great chaos in the world today. Forty years later, Kropotkin's theory of mutual aid among animals was established to remedy this. Kropotkin spent a long time traveling through East Asia, Mongolia, and even the three northeastern provinces, observing various animal societies. As a result, he obtained the theory of mutual aid from his friend, the registrar of the University of St. Petersburg and animal scholar, Kessler. Professor, the well-known zoologist, dean of the St. Petersburg University, then began to oppose Darwin's observational errors. From this, the theory of mutual aid was created to open a new era of human nature towards goodness. Therefore, it is known that the mechanism of life and death in the world is extremely subtle and is actually related to the research and inference of one or two scholars. Therefore, scholars should be cautious. Therefore, I observe animals a lot, and paying attention to the logic of their fighting nature is very important.</p>
<p>Naturalist Ke Dingchu told me, "The 'Materia Medica' animal section has the wotun animal (i.e., the sea dog of the sea dog kidney). People greatly value its navel. The males of this animal fight extremely fiercely. If there are one hundred wotun animals, one male will definitely kill the other ninety-nine males and occupy all one hundred females." These words are indeed true. This can prove that the root of all war crimes comes from male physiology. And now, the mutual killing of ordinary males, blaming class struggle, etc., is not the real reason. It is just the manifestation of the inherent violent nature of males. Those who treat diseases must remove the root. Without seeking to stop the source of war and killing, and wanting to stop killing with killing, there is no such thing.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (283)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears Stain Her Broken Heart, Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Woman's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Since always, for mistresses, after discovering that their husbands have a mistress outside, the first policy is to find a way to move that person from outside into their own home. If that can be done, her work can be considered half successful. Some mistresses, knowing that their husbands have a small house outside, lead their servants and maids, in a mighty way, to rush over and put on a big show of fighting. In Shanghai, there are many such cases. But this kind of thing is close to being ignorant and is something that mistresses of a lower level do. That kind of staggering and rude work, even if the enemy is defeated, does not necessarily bring any prestige to oneself. Things that are resolved by force cannot compare to cultural infiltration. Therefore, virtuous mistresses do not take that kind of approach. The first step is to induce them to come, just like the monarch of an autocratic country towards military officials, preferring to raise their ranks, rather than letting them specialize in external affairs. They thought of their small houses and how cozy they must be. Maybe some places, the small mansion is even more luxurious than the big mansion. Even the chauffeur, male and female servants, also call her "Mistress." Names and titles cannot be given to others. There cannot be two suns in the sky, nor can there be two kings for the people. How can this be allowed? But how can we know how they show off in the small mansions? We can't catch them or get close enough to them. It is a bit sad to think about it. What can we do about it? Can we lower our dignity and go to their small houses every day? If they are in a place that is close to our eyes and ears, we can implement surveillance. Even if we cannot supervise them ourselves, our subordinates can do it for us, so that they dare not be too presumptuous. Therefore, Zhang Yiqing's mistress used this plan. Zhang Yiqing felt that having a mistress outside was already a bit unfair to her. Now that she is making this request, it seems that he can no longer refuse. He said, "Since that's the case, let's discuss canceling the small house and moving back to live with us." Originally, Zhang Yiqing also gradually felt that running around between two places was very busy and that he had no time for external socializing. By combining the two houses, he could free up time to socialize. When he arrived at Cuiyun's place, he told her about this, praising the virtues of the other mistress and talking about how good things were over there. At first, Cuiyun was certainly a little unwilling to move back. But there is another kind of mentality among concubines. She thought that being a mistress in a small house outside was like being in a private den or like a government that is not recognized by the diplomatic corps. Especially if it is hidden from the family, it cannot be officially disclosed. Even if you close the door and act like an emperor, and your servants call you "Mistress," you cannot show your face. After all, you are like a kept woman. When you go to the big mansion, even though you are a concubine, you are there legitimately. The director-general is the director-general, and the vice-director is the vice-director. It's like taking office and not having to hide anymore. Since the other side is so virtuous, as someone's concubine, she might as well condescend a little.</p>

<p>The Gold Market Changes in an Instant</p>
<p>The market situation changed repeatedly yesterday, the 22nd. The gold price situation was unusually complex, with changes occurring constantly, making it difficult to restrain. People were uneasy and it was difficult to grasp. The front and back markets both had twists of five taels, while foreign exchange was relatively stable. The bank's receipts and disbursements were inconsistent. Transactions among peers were not small, but the supply was not constant. In the front market, Yuan Mao, Yonghengxing, and others all had buying intentions, while Zhifeng, Yongfuchang, and others had already sold. Large households such as Yu Dayong, Chengchang, Taikang, Runyuan, Chengyong, etc., supplied and then demanded. The early morning was slightly trending upwards, probably because the big silver bar from the day before continued to fall. Later, it was learned that the French foreign minister was assassinated by the Italian stick party, causing a major dispute between the two countries, etc. Therefore, people were inexplicably afraid, so the price suddenly broke through the 40 tael mark, then dropped sharply by five taels to only within 36 taels. Afterwards, the buyers bravely turned upwards and went beyond the 40 tael mark again. In the after-market, due to poor air, the trend weakened and the turbulence arose. Zhifeng, Yong, Yu Da, etc. tended to sell. Now it has fallen by more than four taels. Only Yuan Mao, Yongxieyu, etc. all have been pursuing. Afterwards, the Indian exchange rate fell repeatedly, especially as each firm had a competitive purchase, and it suddenly rushed to the clouds again and has potential to go beyond 40 taels. In short, the market atmosphere is chaotic and disordered, which is really the effect of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Initially Strong, Then Weak, Then Excellent Again: The November morning opened at 540 taels, plus four qian. Next was 1 tael, 2-3 qian. The day before, the silver bars and silver prices each shrank by one-eighth. The exchange rate did not change. Then, due to reports of tense Franco-Italian negotiations, in case of war, the silver market might rise. Therefore, people's hearts turned downward and immediately cut off more than three taels to 38 taels. The first order was announced and did not move, at 38 taels and up to 39 taels. The internal market exchange rates were flat. Mitsui absorbed near-term Dalian at 1 tael, 2 qian, 2 fen, 6 hao, 2 li, 5 si. Afterwards, Zhifeng, Yong, Yongchengchang, Yuanheng, etc. all had sales. Exchange bills were also loose. Sumitomo issued November English gold at eight pence, and it had already fallen by more than three taels to 35 taels, 7 qian at 10:20 AM. After that, it gradually returned to more than one tael. Yuancheng, Yong, Yu Da, Yuan Mao, Yong, issued and then purchased. In addition, speculators took this opportunity to pursue buying and also strengthened the exchange bills. Mitsui, etc. ate up November English gold at eight pence, six hao, two li, five si. Sumitomo and Zhongfu did recent trading at 40 yuan, two li, five si for Citibank. The market situation suddenly showed an excellent appearance. Continue to add more than three taels. However, from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, there was a twist of one tael. It was nearly 11:45 AM that it reached 40 taels, six qian. When it immediately retreated by one tael, three qian, four qian. By the time the noon closing rose again to 40 taels, two qian.</p>
<p>The After-Market Went From Weak to Strong: The after-market opened slightly lower by two or three qian, at 39 taels, 9 qian. Then it went to 40 taels. Suddenly, rumors spread in the arena that France and Italy were about to start a war. The atmosphere suddenly turned bad and the waves surged. It fell by four taels to 35 taels, 8 qian at 2:30 PM. There were still many sellers on the stage. In a short time, due to the Indian exchange rate reporting a small number of four annas and Yuancheng, Yong, etc. buying, it rose by two taels and several qian to 38 taels, 4-5 qian at 2:45 PM. However, Zhifeng, Yong, Yu Da, etc. still had sales. Moreover, the English full eight pence, one li, two si, five hao in January could not be sold. Then it was bought by Taiwan Wah Bi at one li, eight hao, seven li, five si. The gold price then fell again to 36 taels and a half. After that, Yuan Mao, Yong, Yu and Yong, as well as hedgers, had already purchased. And the exchange bills were mostly stable, causing the gold price to rise leisurely. It rose by more than four taels to 40 taels, eight or nine qian after 4:15 PM. Then, retail investors sold out, returning one tael. At 4:30 PM, the closing price was 539 taels, 5 qian, which was only one qian less compared to the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Closing Price: About 60 Taels. The maximum price of the day was 41 taels, 3 qian, and the minimum price was 35 taels, 7 qian, with a difference of 5 taels, 6 qian. The price fluctuations for the morning and afternoon were the same, with a range of 57-58 taels to 61 taels. The final was more than 57 taels. The registered prices for this month were 52 taels, next month 44 taels, and November 40 taels. The make-up water for the morning and afternoon was 52 taels. The spot goods opened at 40 taels in the morning, closed at 40 taels at noon, and the afternoon opened at 39 taels, 7 qian, closing at 39 taels.</p>
<p>The Trading Intent is Very Uncertain: The firms involved in trading included Yuan Mao, Yonghengxing, Yuan Da, Yongchunyuan, Yong Jun, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuancheng, Yong, Yu Da, Da Decheng, Yuanxingyong, etc., which had receipts and disbursements from time to time. Yiyu, Zhifeng, Yongfuchang, Xinxing, etc., generally sold out. In the afternoon, Yuan Mao, Yuancheng, Yongyu, Xingyong, Yongfeng, and Xieyu all entered. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, and Zhifengyong had inconsistent entries and exits. Yu Da, Shunli, Yuancheng, etc. all exited. Taikang, Run Da, Da Decheng, and Fuchang had unstable receipts and disbursements. Hedgers bought and sold at random and were inconsistent. The Dalian gang had a flat entry and exit, totaling more than 2,000 taels. The Guangdong gang entered 4-500 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Was Seemingly Stable But Actually Tight</h3>
<p>The internal market ultimately trended firm. Yesterday, the HSBC foreign exchange rates were unchanged. Overseas silver markets were slightly lower than the day before, but the market situation was flat. English and American exchange rates were slightly soft. Japanese and American, and English and Japanese did not change. Reuters' reports also showed no rise or fall. As for the internal market exchange rates of local banks, they slightly fluctuated and ultimately seemed firm. Compared to last Saturday, English gold shrank by six hao, two li, five si, American gold shrank by one li, two si, five si, and Japanese gold increased by two li, five si. However, the gold price market was agitated by the atmosphere, changing suddenly. As a result, it was flat at 39 taels. Chinese merchants, speculators, and gold traders had active transactions. In the front market, each firm had contracted to enter 50,000 to 60,000 pounds of English gold. HSBC, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Mai Bank, etc. all had sales. Afterwards, tens of thousands of pounds were once sold. Sumitomo, Wah Bi, and Mitsui absorbed it. In the afternoon, Fuchang, etc. sold 40,000 to 50,000 pounds. Zhejiang, Taiwan, Sumitomo, etc. took it in. Mostly, hedging was done on the gold price. American gold was traded among banks for more than 100,000 yuan. Chinese merchants bought 100,000 yuan. Maclary had some sales. Japanese gold was traded in small quantities. Mitsui bought and Korea sold. The market atmosphere seemed to be spinning and people were dazed and uncertain.</p>

Yesterday, the trading situation of various public bonds in the local securities market was sparse for spot goods, such as the previous futures were still good. Buying and selling continued to be lively in the front and back markets. As for the changes in the bond prices, after the initial opening in the morning, the supply and demand were still flat, with little fluctuation compared to the previous weekend. Subsequently, the selling pressure in the market turned smooth and the buying situation was slightly scattered. As a result, the bond prices suddenly turned weak and fell step by step. The military reduction fell more sharply. The fluctuations in the front and back markets exceeded two yuan, which was a decrease of about two yuan compared to the previous week. The consolidation of the customs futures was also quite weak, falling by one yuan and several jiao compared to the previous weekend.

<h3>Yarn Flower, Yarn Market Reacted Violently</h3>
<p>The situation is peaceful and merchants in the mainland are all buying</p>
<p>The three grades have rebounded and the situation for local yarn has suddenly turned good</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm and the rise is sharp. It is based on the view that merchants in the mainland are all buying and retailers are showing panic, so the market atmosphere is very good. At the same time, the spot yarn client gangs are actively searching for purchases and many have turned from short to long, so this has evolved into a fierce reaction. However, Japanese factories took the opportunity to release about 2-30,000 bales, which were all absorbed by peers and foreign firms. Osaka's three grades of yarn soared by 3-4 yuan in the afternoon. According to Nisshin Foreign Firm, Chinese merchants have purchased more than 10,000 bales in these days, so the rise is even stronger. As a result, the local yarn market is becoming more and more bullish. The current situation is extremely chaotic. According to some, most of the yarn bought by various gangs is still speculative in nature and will still be based on the general sales for advances and retreats.</p>
<h3>The Marked Yarn Rises Two Taels and More</h3>
<p>The Exchange People's Marked Price: When the early market opened before the auction, the market atmosphere was tight and each rose by 7-8 qian. The more the second and third rounds of bidding rose, the thicker the buying atmosphere in the venue, and each month rose by 8-9 qian to 1 tael and 2 qian. In the afternoon, the three grades of yarn trended up by 2-3 yuan and each month rose by another 5-6-8-9 qian. The total turnover for the whole day was 32,550 bales. The sales were: Gongtai 1,450 bales, Ruidda 2,650 bales, Guangfeng 950 bales, Shenchang 3,200 bales, Daji 950 bales, Senkang 850 bales, and the rest were 450-500 bales. The purchases were: Dafu 2,400 bales, Rongxing 2,300 bales, Yiyu 1,150 bales, Lichang 1,600 bales, Xincheng 2,500 bales, Yongfeng 900 bales, and the rest were 350-450 bales.

<h3>Spot Yarn Sales Are Active</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales have been more active than the day before. It is estimated that the total spot and futures purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 4,810 bales.

<h3>The Cotton Market Presents a Flourishing Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The weather is bad and Hankou is experiencing wind and rain</p>
<p>The high price of the yarn market is pulling in quite a few people</p>
<p>The trend of American cotton is still flat and weak. However, the local cotton market has risen due to bad weather and wind and rain in Hankou. In addition, the yarn market is soaring and outsiders are seeing an improvement in the yarn market and are pulling in quite a few people for cotton. Also, the three grades of yarn are rising and it is expected that American cotton will rebound. As a result, the market atmosphere is getting more and more bullish. However, the actual situation is still difficult to be optimistic because the various factories have absorbed enough Indian cotton and the prices are cheaper, so the silver cotton transactions are still silent. The Hankou gang and Japanese merchants are selling when the price rises. Japanese merchants have to look at one jiao, but the bad weather can temporarily rise.</p>
<h3>The Hankou Mark Rose As High As Five Qian</h3>
<p>The Hankou mark opened in the early market with a flat and weak market atmosphere. Although the yarn market rose, retailers bought and rose by two or three qian. In the afternoon, the three grades rose and a large household bought empty without limit, so each month rose by another two or three qian. The total turnover for the whole day was 59,700 dan.

The purchases were: Ruidda 5,000 dan, Yongfeng 3,400 dan, Daji 4,100 dan, Xincheng 2,100 dan, Xiesheng 2,500 dan and the rest were 1,000-150 dan.

<h3>Japanese Factories Purchased 10,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Last Week</h3>
<p>English Cotton Spot Sales Quite Strong</p>
<p>Bombay's market prices last week fluctuated slightly. Business was slow, and sales were mostly short positions covering their losses. Spot goods demand was excellent, and European buyers completed transactions for Pingguoer Flower and Pilar Flower. Japanese manufacturers purchased 10,000 bales within the week. Chinese demand was sluggish. Cotton district reports indicated that cotton production in various regions was generally satisfactory.

The Egyptian cotton market is uneven and stagnant.</p>
<h3>Grain: Major Decline and Minor Rebound in Rice Market Downriver</h3>
<p>Yesterday in Zhabei, over thirty boats arrived from inland. Sales were somewhat active due to the overcast weather, so sellers' intentions softened, unwilling to accept price cuts. Therefore, prices across the board showed a major decline followed by a minor rebound. Broken japonica rice was scarce and remained at a fixed price, with very little trading. Western new japonica rice generally declined and stabilized. Newly arrived Changbang high-quality rice opened at 19.6 yuan; this batch was of exceptional quality. The remaining upper and middle-grade rice hovered around 19 yuan. The market situation was relatively stable. Eastern new japonica rice opened at 18 yuan, similar to previous trading. Throughout the day, japonica rice prices were slightly firmer due to the overcast weather. New Yangjian rice opened at 13.5-13.6 yuan for ordinary quality, high-quality Duzi indica rice at 15 yuan, Guanwai Xinbu Jian at 13.3 yuan, and Kejian at 13 yuan or more. Interest in various indica rice types was only about 5 to 10 fen better than the previous day. In recent days, the decline in new indica rice prices has been very sharp. Yesterday, due to the slightly smaller arrivals, sellers were cautiously watching the market. If the weather clears up, prices will still need to decline further. Baiyuan saw a small decline of two jiao, opening at 18.7 yuan. The market situation softened due to slow arrivals and sluggish sales. About twenty boats arrived at the Shanghai South River, with moderate sales. Broken japonica rice was weak in the morning but stabilized in the afternoon. Result rice opened at 19.3-19.4 yuan. New japonica rice prices initially declined and then stabilized. General rice was 17.5-17 yuan. Yangjian and Duzi indica rice all remained weak, opening at 13.2-13.3 yuan. Jiaobai indica rice followed the same trend as new Jian rice, also trending towards stabilization. Currently, conditions here still shift with the Zhabei market.</p>
<h3>Kejian Suddenly Plunged Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>New Duzi Japonica Rice Has Entered the Market, Sales Very Slow</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market for foreign rice. Kejian rice, however, plummeted by as much as half a yuan. Duzi rice also fell by a small fraction. This was mainly because various types of indica rice were being launched on the market, and early rice was also plentiful. Local mainland Ke Bang no longer had any need for it. Jiangxi rice was arriving at a rate of several thousand bags per day, with only this street taking it in, making it difficult for the market to sustain itself for long. Furthermore, the influx of Zhejiang Duzi rice caused even more instability, resulting in yesterday's sharp drop of half a yuan. It is estimated that 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed early rice were traded at a price of 11.9-11 yuan, and 100 bags of machine-processed Yuan rice were traded at 17.5 yuan. 100 bags of Hunan indica rice were traded at 11 yuan. Aside from Tianjin Bang buying a hundred or so bags of machine-processed early rice, all was taken in by the same street.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Constrained by Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the various months once showed signs of vigor. With the political situation in Tianjin stabilized, the shipment of southern flour to the north was naturally no longer a problem. This caused some inland customers and many speculative short sellers to fear that actual sales would drive up the standard, so they rushed to cover their positions. Therefore, the highest price for the current month reached 2 taels, 4 mace, and 8 fen. October reached 2 taels, 4 mace, and 4 and a half fen. November reached 2 taels, 4 mace, and 1 fen. December all reached 4 mace and 1 guan. However, after the second round of trading, prices gradually softened again. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat was still very low, and it was heard that mainland factories had ordered 30,000 tons of foreign wheat, while local factories had ordered over 40,000 tons, there was no fear of a shortage of raw materials in the future. The possibility of a significant rise in the standard was therefore reduced. As a result, those engaged in selling were still very enthusiastic. In the afternoon, the various trading rounds still saw a return of sellers, and the various months uniformly fell back, differing by as much as two or three fen from the morning's peak. As a result, the current month and October were down by a small 7 and a half li compared to the previous week, November was down by a small 1 fen and 7 and a half li, and December to February were down by a small 1 fen and a half li.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Sees a Decline of Three or Four Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market presented an initial firming followed by weakness in the morning. The current month initially saw some firmness because there was still a plentiful supply of spot goods on the market. Although sales were not brisk, the standard used for delivery was generally合格, and slightly higher grades could be 可可升格. Therefore, those short sellers with physical goods had a solid mindset, and the distant months also rose slightly. However, in the afternoon, the quotation for foreign wheat continued to be small, and the amount of foreign wheat ordered by factories was already considerable. If the standard was to rise again, those who were selling would undoubtedly increase. Therefore, the various months began to decline again. As a result, the current month was down by 2 fen compared to the previous day, October and November were down by 1 fen, December was down by 3 fen, January was down by 4 fen, and February was down by 3 fen. There was a lot of inventory in the spot wheat market. 福新 wheat company chose to purchase 3,000 packages of Shandong Haizhou Shashi Yao wheat, and the price was not very different compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Standard Yellow Beans Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard Dalian Yuan beans futures market turned weak again. Reports of short sales were frequent. Mainland traders were not eager to buy because the new soybean harvest in Anhui province was abundant this year. Only oil mill traders showed some interest. Therefore, in the afternoon, the price fell back to 5.03 taels, down more than half a qian. The January futures opened at 5.02 taels, with little trading. The market outlook was generally weak.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Sugar Opened with a Relatively Good Tone</h3>
<p>Dutch White Sugar Trading Remains Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from producing regions, Cuba, New York, and Java, were silent. The association's market pricing for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white saw quiet buying interest. The asking price of 8 taels saw little interest. New goods at 8 taels and 1.5 qian saw some trading. The market situation was flat. Finely ground white sugar was 8 taels and 1 qian. No. 20 medium granulated white was 7 taels and 7.5 qian, with sluggish trading. Japanese sugar trading remained bleak. Meiji YP mark was 8 taels and 2 qian, YRO mark was 7 taels and 8 qian, and Minghua YP mark was 8 taels and 1.5 qian. YT mark was 7 taels and 9.5 qian, mark was 8 taels and 2.5 qian. The market was in decline. Traders selling Dutch sugar included Huaxin brand, offering immediate delivery of No. 3 dregs ice at 10 taels and 9 qian per bag, with weak demand. Zhenxiang brand offered several hundred bags of Cuban 洋百 at 6 taels and 9 qian per bag. Jinfang brand offered 2,000 bags of spot No. 9 Dutch red sugar at 6 taels and 2 qian per bag, all of which were sold at a firm price.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Prices for Xinghua Longan Have Been Set</h3>
<p>A significant amount of new Xinghua longan has arrived, but the cost is not low. Therefore, the industry has convened various trade associations to determine the selling price as follows: 正牌正二定 is set at 51 taels, 秃秃 at 55 taels, 桶全 at 54 taels, 兴及 at 28 taels, and 兴开 at 25 taels. This price is limited to inland river traders. Street and export traders will add or refund as usual.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Kelp Abundant Harvest, Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>Arrivals Flood In, Transactions Lack, Opening Prices Drop. Demand for Kelp Has Been Exceptionally Slow Recently. It is difficult to sell the goods that have arrived previously. A survey of the inventories held by the 行号 companies shows that there are still about 20,000 packages in stock across various shops. Although the companies are willing to lower prices to sell them off, there are few inquiries. Furthermore, according to telegrams from Japanese merchants, the harvest of new goods in various places this year is abundant. The arrival of subsequent goods will inevitably be overwhelming, so people are even more afraid. When customers encounter transactions, they dare not rush to purchase. Therefore, the market is even more tired. The prices of old Gen Shitsu kelp being peddled are 5 taels and 7 qian, and Hama Nakagawa Road Atsugishi, etc., are 5 taels and 3-4 qian. 9,137 packages of new goods were previously transported by the Japanese ship Chikuzen Maru to various shops. Because the firms have no intention of buying in, formal trading prices have not yet been set. It is heard that the Wusong Maru will arrive within a few days, carrying about 10,000 packages or more of new kelp.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Cables Still Fresh, Transferred to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, the overseas silk market has been exceptionally quiet. Shanghai factories are嫌價昂, and Shanghai manufacturers take a passive attitude because of this. Yesterday, 纬成 brand 蚕医牌 Grade 13 to 22 raw white factory silk, 20 packages, were only priced at 945 taels.</p>
<h3>Chang'an Autumn Dried Cocoons Eagerly Awaiting Transport</h3>
<p>The railway bureau lacks locomotives, and 8,000-9,000 cocoon packages are accumulated. The autumn cocoon market in Chang'an, Haining, and Xiashi has ended. The silkworm cocoons collected by silk merchants have been dried, stored, and are awaiting transportation at Chang'an Station. However, the railway bureau lacks locomotives, and the station has accumulated 8,000-9,000 cocoon packages. Silk merchants are preparing to hire ships for transportation.</p>
<h3>Xiūméi Tea's Sales are Still Good</h3>
<p>The Russian Assistance Association is About to Open</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in Shanghai turned sluggish. There were no large transactions for Zhenmei needles and eyebrow etc. sales of Xiumei tea were still active. However, tea prices are very low. There is no market for large brands such as Gongxi. However, the Russian Assistance Association is about to open, so there seems to be a glimmer of hope. As for Qining black tea, because the British market is filled with Indian tea, it remains sluggish and is unlikely to be cleared this year.</p>
<h3>Textiles: The Textile Market After the Restoration of Peace</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth from this factory and Dongzhigong呢 are being vigorously sought by Northern buyers. Prices are gradually rising as trading opens, and the market is thriving. The cotton market in this factory is fairly stable, with most goods rising and few falling. The fine cloth that had softened at one point yesterday was being held by holders who refused to sell, so it is difficult to see prices falling in the short term. Fine twill is becoming increasingly hard. Yesterday, Sichuan buyers were seeking Blue Double Fish cloth, so spot goods are scarce. There is a strong demand from Northern buyers for coarse cloth. Hubei Tianzi cloth has already cleared customs at 8 taels. Yesterday, it opened at 8 taels and 7.5 fen, the highest price this year. Luzi cloth is 7 taels and 8 qian. 11-pound cloth with three deer or three cats is the most sought after. Southern Guangdong buyers have been purchasing heavily in recent days.

<p>Western and Eastern Textiles: Western goods are quite scarce this year, so they are quite quiet. Yesterday, only Gongping line offered 100 pieces of 放鲤直贡呢 at 2 qian, 4 fen, and 2 li. Eastern goods are exceptionally lively. Since the restoration of peace, Northern buyers have been seeking them heavily. Yesterday, Tianjin and Qingdao buyers were again vigorously seeking 直贡呢, so 猎雁慕秋 requires 3 qian, 2 fen. Moganshan requires 3 qian, 1 fen, and 7 li. Shuangtonglu requires 2 qian and 8 and a half fen. But the prices offered by traders must be raised by one fen further. Fine Flannel is also soaring. Baoqiu opened at 3 qian, 2 fen. Gucheng Hui opened at 3 qian, 2 fen, and a half fen. Huxinting opened at 2 qian, 7 fen, and 2 li. Zijinshan opened at 2 qian, 6 fen, and 7 li to 2 qian and 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Medium and Thick Flannel in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Medium and thick dark blue flannel have been selling well in the market recently. Tailors in native 客 bang need a lot of it. The market atmosphere is very strong.

<h3>On the Centennial of Camille Pissarro, Pioneer of Impressionism</h3>
<p>— Chen Deming</p>
<p>This year marks the centennial of Camille Pissarro (born in 1830), a pioneer of Impressionism. The Musée de l'Orangerie in France (affiliated with the Louvre Museum) is holding a centennial celebration for him. Tabarant, a leading modern French art critic, edited the commemorative publication. In his introduction, he said that this move is the first official tribute to Impressionism by the French government, and for Pissarro personally, it is a national honor.</p>
<p>It is entirely appropriate for the French government to pay such a solemn tribute to Pissarro. Pissarro was the oldest of that group of Impressionist warriors, gained fame the latest, and in some respects, he was the greatest among them. Pissarro's late success was precisely because he had several particularly great qualities, namely profoundness, simplicity, and dislike of ostentation. He did not cater to low-grade tastes and collectors' prejudices in general.</p>
<p>Impressionist painting is the art of the French nation. The struggles of the Impressionists were more arduous and lasted longer than any movements before or after them. The Impressionist movement was thoroughly revolutionary. It changed the entire nature of painting and created the modern art of France. The first Impressionist exhibition was held in 1874. This day is the birth of modern art. Among these Impressionist pioneers, the most arduous struggle was Pissarro's. In 1874, he was already 44 years old. In the next 20 years, he lived in poverty every day, but he fought hard in the art arena without slackening. Twenty years later, he finally overcame all the difficulties and was able to live a slightly easier life. Because life was a little easier, his artistic garden expanded even further. Now, let's discuss Pissarro's art by dividing it into the following sections:</p>
<p>(1) Key Points of Pissarro's Art</p>
<p>The key point of Pissarro's art is that he found inspiration in life and nature. These things themselves are much greater than those who contemplate or express them. In other words, the source of inspiration is greater than the thing that expresses inspiration. This kind of attitude is rare among painters, especially among modern painters. However, it is a necessary element for great artistic creation. Rembrandt, the great Dutch painter of the 17th century, had this attitude. Sargent, the 19th-century British painter, could not become a superior painter because he did not have this attitude, despite his extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>Pissarro's perception and inner observation were very profound. This profound perception and inner observation cannot be expressed by the fluent painting style that pleases the general public. He strictly regarded painting as a method to achieve a goal. His technique was perfectly suited to express his intuition. In his later years, his observation became deeper, and his technique became more complex and skillful. Among Impressionist painters, if each is compared, Monet's paintings have a charming rhythm that can please people, but Monet's art is relatively shallow and not enough to express Pissarro's profound thoughts. Monet specialized in painting the illusion of light and air, but Pissarro was more profound than him. Pissarro loved the things themselves, the main characteristics of things, and the permanent qualities of things.</p>
<p>Among Impressionist painters, Monet was the earliest to be welcomed, for reasons already mentioned above. In addition, Sisley and Renoir also gained fame successively because their paintings had a moving rhythm. Pissarro's art was simpler than theirs and was difficult for people to appreciate at first. However, by 1892, the trend finally turned, and the value of his art began to be recognized. Unfortunately, he was already a 62-year-old man at this time, and he passed away after only a few years of easy living. The sunset is infinitely beautiful, but it is near dusk, which can be used to describe Pissarro.</p>
<p>Pissarro also emphasized expressing the sentiments of the French countryside. Several of his masterpieces are paintings of farmers. He was close to the farmers in his country's villages and deeply understood them. He painted French rural life with a realistic eye, which differed from Millet's painting of farmers with a moral eye. As for his paintings of Paris scenery and life, they were initially not weaker than his rural life paintings. He depicted the scenery of Paris with a sincere and gentle feeling. This passionate view made his works more full of inspiration.</p>
<p>(2) Various Periods of Pissarro's Artistic Development</p>
<p>The development of Pissarro's art can be divided into several periods:</p>
<p>(1) Early Period: When Pissarro first came to Paris from his birthplace, the Dutch West Indies, he deeply loved the landscape paintings of Corot and the realistic founder Courbet. In addition, the writers he admired during this period were Delacroix, Millet, and other writers belonging to the Barbizon School. These several influences were cleverly combined in his early works, along with the expression of his personality. The most prominent point in these early works was a straightforward spirit. However, these works were still a record of things, unlike his later works, which were a profound expression of emotion.</p>
<p>(2) Period in England: In 1870, France was at war, and Pissarro traveled far to England and settled in London to engage in painting. Like Monet, he was influenced by the great British landscape painters Turner and Constable. From this time on, his paintings presented a clear and bright atmosphere, and his technique gradually changed because his new sense of color required a new method to express it. During this period, he painted many portraits for his young children. These portraits show an exceptionally keen sense, and the method of expression is sufficient to convey this feeling in detail.</p>
<p>(3) Period of Depicting Market Scenes: From 1882, Pissarro began to depict market scenes. Market scenes are often painted by general painters, but Pissarro's method of depiction was unique. There is a sense of intimacy in his market scene paintings. This sense of intimacy is the element and characteristic of all his works.</p>
<p>(4) Pointillist Period: In 1888, Pissarro began to experiment with Pointillism (Seurat and Signac were pure pointillist painters). As a result, his technique had further development. However, this was only a development and not a change. Pointillism increased the changes and value in his colors. However, this method was too mechanical and not worthy of his responsive personality. His feeling must be directly transferred to the canvas or paper, and there is a close relationship between his expression and the results that cannot be obtained by those contrived and mixed procedures. The effects of the pointillist experiment can be best seen in Pissarro's works of 1890. From this time on, his works entered the richest and most mature period. However, this only means that his observations became more in-depth. In fact, his works from each period have a very high status and are not different in quality.</p>
<p>(5) Late Period: In 1890, Pissarro returned to London to paint. Two years later, he began to produce that series of amazing depictions of city life in Dieppe, Rouen, Le Havre, and Paris, depicting almost all the streets, gardens, and seaside scenery of those famous areas. This series fully expresses the beautiful mood in terms of light and air.</p>
<p>(3) Influence of Pissarro's Art</p>
<p>Pissarro's firm spirit, sincere attitude, and superb art attracted many people to seek advice and learn from him. Gauguin and Cézanne, the giants of Post-Impressionism, often came to his residence to seek advice and greatly admired him. Pissarro can be said to be a major bridge between Impressionism and post-Impressionist art.</p>
<p>Literary and Art Talk</p>
<h3>The Art of Fauvism</h3>
<p>— Changxi</p>
<p>Recently, in various countries, the name of Picasso, the founder of Fauvism, has been used to refer to modern French art. Although Fauvism was more than 20 years ago, there are still neo-Fauvist writers who have inherited his movement, so they still occupy a very important position in French art.</p>
<p>This year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York specially spent a lot of money to collect the works of 25 surviving French Fauvist painters for exhibition. The catalog of works says:</p>
<p>Matisse, Derain, Valminck, Braque, Rouaut, Sufy, and Fiesz are a group of brave, heroic, and radiant friends with passionate expression and amazing魄力(pòlì- spirit, daring). They were the first very important discovery of the artistic usage of the late 19th-century Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Van Gogh and the 19th-century French opponent of the Neo-Impressionist giant Gauguin, and were also the first to feel the power of Cézanne, the father of the almost incomprehensible Post-Impressionism. At the same time, they obtained inspiration from medieval inlaid glass paintings, woodcuts, Near Eastern paintings, Negro sculptures, Coptic topics, and early children's paintings, which made them shine into a world of radiant art. They broke the traditional habits and natural depictions. The two most important points are the expression of the purpose of painting and unique emotions. A new situation was created by a group of unruly Fauvist painters.</p>
<p>However, the young Fauvist group reached middle age and lost much of their courage and wild spirit. Only Derain and Matisse continued to move upward bravely. Now we feel that there are only half a dozen of the greatest artists alive. Derain is full of life force, wisdom, and diligence, and continues to be regarded by our eyes as a master of revival. Marius also has the same power. No one can match his excellence in color and appearance.</p>
<p>This introduction can express the spirit of Fauvism. In this exhibition, Americans became more enthusiastic about the two of them because of the introduction's prompts. They and Picasso are both recognized by the world as masters in modern French national painting. Recently, when Derain's solo exhibition opened in London, T.W. Earp commented on Derain in the New Statesman magazine, saying that Derain is one of the three great masters who has little feeling, and can almost be said to have little smell of sympathy arising from feeling. He never tried his best to excite, and he is also unwilling. He is first and foremost an accusation to the heart, not to the nerves and consciousness. This criticism belongs to another aspect.</p>
<h3>Diligent Shelley</h3>
<p>Shelley was a book reader and also a hard worker. He almost never let go of books, whether in the dining hall, bedroom, or even when walking.</p>
<p>Hogg said, "I have never seen such a book reader. He spends sixteen hours out of twenty-four reading."</p>
<p>Shelley was an extreme atheist when he was at Oxford University. He vigorously attacked Christianity and finally wrote a book called "On the Necessity of Atheism," which he distributed to friends and advertised for sale at the same time.</p>
<p>This kind of opinion at that time in England was carrying a very rebellious nature and was generally regarded as shocking. On March 25, 1811, he was expelled from Oxford University, which shows the influence of this book.</p>
<p>He and the aforementioned friend Hogg were expelled from the school at the same time. He ignored his father's fierce opposition and just walked towards what he believed in. (Ping)</p>

<p>A Word of Concern about Small Printing Presses</p>
<p>The more civilized the world, the more complex the undertakings. The more complex the undertakings, the wider the application of writing. The wider the application of writing, the more urgent the need for duplication. Therefore, from copying to engraving, from dullness to gathering treasures, lead, stone, zinc, and copper have emerged vigorously. The outlines of Ke Luo are ingenious and stacked. It is also disliked that manual labor is slow, and the use of mechanical force, wind, coal, water, and electricity is updated daily. However, this is beneficial to broad formats of thousands, but clumsy to small works of hundreds. There are also carbon copies, typewriters, mimeographs, and gelatin plates to alleviate their poverty, but there are frequent shortcomings and mutual benefits. They are either blurred and rough, or they can only be used for a small number of parts. They can be learned but not drawn. They are suitable for reading but not for charts. Or the writing is only beneficial to the horizontal writing of Europe and the West, but not to the vertical writing of China. Or the paper is only suitable for foreign goods of wood and cloth, but not for the national products of cotton and paper. Therefore, the advanced countries of material things in the West still lack good structures. Since serving as an accountant, Shiwen has often needed multiple copies of documents and tables, which is painful and time-consuming. Bureau of the market printing on behalf of then waste again see reported year earlier Cantonese gentleman Chung invention of Chung Ling Printing machine, claimed production exquisite, very like lithography, while plate-making printing easy hundredfold, but small, delicate, carrying very convenient, that is to buy a used device, under which the gram characters said, while the inventor not complacent, more elaborate with original product there are shortcomings, willing to have been thrown capital end to publication, repeatedly improved, near the beginning announced its success, that of the original draft of the remainder, then plate-making one or two times who now the time of day are unlimited number, since the pen stroke a long time and either coarse rises changed shape, word performance since too thin and either off hidden blurred who can now be permanently unchanged, since the glass version because of the force uneven and or depression machine box, as a result of force too much and or breakage who can now be long-term protection of flatness</p>

<h3>Jinan University Emphasizes Moral Education</h3>
<p>In the past, National Jinan University did not pay much attention to moral education, especially in the university department. Overseas Chinese who have returned to China for a long time have not been influenced by Chinese culture, so it is not appropriate to strictly control them. However, the academic atmosphere has become slightly decadent, leading to unfortunate incidents this year. The Jinan University authorities, in view of this, believe that the lack of moral education is the reason for the decline of the academic atmosphere. Therefore, it has been decided that starting from this semester, moral education will be greatly strengthened. In the university department, Tang Demin, the former executive member of the Shanghai Municipal Government, has been hired as the director of moral education, with Pan Hua as the deputy, and Rao Shuliang, Zhang Shaoliang, Guo Shuliang, and Chen Zhongfu as instructors, and Xu Minyi as the general affairs officer. In order to facilitate the implementation of moral education in universities and middle schools, a joint committee of universities and middle schools has been organized, and the chairman is also Tang Demin. The matters of moral education are divided into several items, such as party righteousness, moral education, homework examination, and conduct examination. Each week, the moral education department recruits students in classes to study party righteousness. A morning meeting is held every day, and the director of moral education teaches the students the true meaning of orderliness and discipline, as well as the school's prohibitions. He also explains the shortcomings of the school's student moral education recently and hopes to improve the disputes that occur temporarily. The moral education department also handles matters impartially. The department sends staff to each classroom and each place every day to check whether the students are diligent in their homework, whether the interactions between classmates are legal, and whether the students have violated any rules. A report is submitted to the department for review. From now on, the academic atmosphere of Jinan University will be revitalized.</p>

<h3>Impressions of the North (II)</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>Sea Journey</p>
<p>I remember seeing the sea in my childhood dreams, with blue waves splashing up white waves. This was because my mother told me a story about the sea one day. This impression was very deep in my memory, so last summer I went to Wusong several times to see the sea and made several oil paintings of the sea. However, the sea that can be seen in Wusong is really not as great as the sea in my childhood dreams. I should regret that my friends traveled to Putuo to paint, but I did not go with them.</p>
<p>Well, this time it is not a dream. The full view of the sea is unfolded before my eyes. The vast expanse is boundless in all directions. Under the dome of the empty sky, there are only blue waves rolling, and when the waves collide with each other, they splash up fine white waves and foam. If it were not for the vibration of the machinery of the ship I was on, listening to the sound of the waves colliding, the waves falling, and the rushing torrents, this would be a mysterious and ethereal natural Canada.</p>
<p>Sea, my soul shouted out in a relaxed and expanding way to the emptiness. I wanted to open my arms. If I would not die after throwing myself into these waves, I would like to have my small soul and body washed by the greatness.</p>
<p>Although the air is so cold and the sea breeze is so piercing, I am always unwilling to return to the dirty air and the third-class cabin filled with a large amount of carbon dioxide. However, Mr. Chen, who was traveling with me, was not like this. After boarding the ship and entering the cabin, he did not come out. I only saw him walk on the deck once.</p>
<p>The sailors were busy. I leaned on the iron railing, lowered my head to gaze at the splashing waves, raised my head to look up at the vast sky, and looked far into the boundless horizon of the sky and the sea. This great and long-lasting nature gave me infinite magical and ethereal inspiration.</p>
<p>The nature in my eyes is not like the misty scenery of the sea depicted by English marine painters, nor is it like the tropical sea on Gauguin's paintings. It is really like the sea described in medieval literary works. So I imagined the life of pirates, sailing on a blue wave with a sail, or gathering on a black warship and galloping in a boundless sea with a romantic mood.</p>
<p>The night gradually enveloped the sea, and the sky turned dark after a bloody glow disappeared. The air was even colder, and the twinkling of the stars only seemed smaller. Gray foam floated on the black-green waves, and the wheels seemed to have increased the vibration even more. The ship seemed to be sailing more powerfully.</p>
<p>The cold air of the sea night called me to return to the cabin.</p>
<p>From a talkative lady in the same cabin, I learned an outline of the north and increased my interest in going north. She said that Harbin is very rich in exotic atmosphere. She said that the Russians there can provide you with models for painting. She said...</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Chen was making sketches with a sketchbook. The Japanese on the Skai side were making noise with a record player, singing Japanese opera, which was really annoying to listen to.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because a strong wind had risen, or perhaps it was because the waves on this section of the sea voyage were relatively large, so the ship suddenly swayed. I was afraid of seasickness and vomiting, so I quietly went to sleep, vaguely hearing the sharp voice of the talkative lady.</p>
<p>In the dimness, I fell into a dream.</p>
<p>I was driving a small boat and swaying in the blue sea, playing with the waves with a willow branch. The gray shadow of a seabird swept past the sail.</p>
<h3>Daxia Wanbai Literary Society</h3>
<p>— You Pei</p>
<p>Since the official establishment of the society on March 11th this spring, there have been more than 50 members. Their combination is based on reason and emotion, so they can understand and encourage each other. The spirit of kindness and sincerity is something that other groups in Daxia cannot match. In the past semester, their achievements have been quite remarkable. For example, the publication of Wanbai Publications is intended to awaken national consciousness with the power of literature and art in a difficult era. The rich content has been praised by students and professors. The Wanbai team's competition results were one win against the Sanxiang team, another win against the Auoi team, and consecutive wins against the Tongfu team and the East Asia team outside the school. These many news items have been published in this column and the Daxia Weekly, so I will not repeat them here. Due to the summer vacation, the society also temporarily suspended work. Now that the school has started, the new and old groups in Daxia have been actively preparing for work. According to a conversation with the chairman of the society, Mr. Xu Zexiang, dozens of new and old students plan to join the society. It is expected that the number of members in this semester can increase to more than 100. It is now scheduled to hold an executive committee meeting at the new campus of Daxia in Fanwangdu this Thursday (25th) to resume work and discuss the society's work direction and development plan. The society's future will definitely have a new look.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Caoye Hangzhou Branch</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Caoye Society at No. 34 Feilun Road, it has been two years, and the society's affairs have been very developed. There are also many kinds of books published. The weekly magazine "Caoye," which is published every week, aims to connect members and promote nationalistic literature and art. It has also been published to Volume 3, No. 8, and has a wide circulation. The Hangzhou Caoye Branch was officially established on the 15th of this month. The address of the branch is No. 21 Damalong, Chenghuang Archway, Hangzhou City. The director is Fan Dajun, and the staff members are Guo Chengping, Wu Shousong, and Zhu Yaoshu. Bookstores and newspaper vendors in Hangzhou who want to sell Caoye Society's books and newspapers on consignment can contact the Hangzhou Branch. At the beginning of the establishment of the branch, members are recruited for one month. During the recruitment period, the membership fee can be reduced by 50 cents. Because students from various schools have sent letters requesting that the Shanghai Caoye Society specifically recruit students to join the society, it will also hold a recruitment of members from today to October 10th, but it is not limited to students.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Develops Overseas Chinese Education</h3>
<p>National Jinan University has an important mission for overseas Chinese education. It has specially organized the Southeast Asian and American Cultural Affairs Department to be responsible for the development of overseas Chinese education. Over the years, the development of the business has become a central agency for studying overseas Chinese affairs and consulting at home. After the start of the semester, the Cultural Affairs Department held its first departmental meeting and decided on many cases for the development of overseas Chinese education. First, a training class for overseas Chinese affairs will be set up to cultivate specialized talents for the development of overseas Chinese education and culture. Preparations will be made immediately to organize and start classes. All students are overseas Chinese who have returned to China to study at the school and have achievements and aspirations to develop overseas Chinese culture. The quota is 30 students, and the quota has already been filled. It is estimated that 10 students are from the Southeast Asian class, 10 students from various regions of Australia, 5 students from Canada, and 5 students from Europe. The quota is determined according to the number and needs of overseas Chinese in each region. The period is one year. After graduation, Jinan University will consult the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to send them to various regions to handle overseas Chinese education. It is said that the classes are held for more than eight hours every day because the deadline is short. The courses taught are practical, and special attention is paid to reading materials that promote Chinese nationalism, so that they can be sent to various regions to promote the national consciousness of overseas Chinese. Other subjects, such as Chinese, English, law, politics, economics, education, psychology, and social sciences, as well as physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences, are also available. Second, the department will send personnel to investigate the status of overseas Chinese education in Southeast Asia. It has been decided to organize an inspection group with a fixed number of ten members, led by Mr. Liu Shimu. It is scheduled to depart for Southeast Asia after the National Day. The scope of the investigation includes: 1. The number of schools and their content in each region; 2. The total number of overseas Chinese students and their ages; 3. The treatment of overseas Chinese schools by the governments of each region; 4. Testing the level of schools at all levels, especially their knowledge of Chinese and Party principles. The scope of publicity includes: 1. Publicizing Jinan University's facilities and content; 2. China's current cultural progress; 3. The smooth progress of military affairs. In general, the mission of the group is very important for overseas Chinese education. After returning home and compiling various reports, it can be made public to the people of the country for reference by those who study overseas Chinese education, and it can also serve as an important standard for the implementation of teaching in the school's overseas Chinese training class. It is said that the inspection period is set for one or two months, and the cost is approximately more than 4,000 yuan. The Cultural Affairs Department has requested the president to transfer the funds to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee for disbursement (Mian).</p>
