<p>電通社十七日東京電　本日之樞府精查委員會僅樞府方面委員出席於午後一時開會二時五十分散會對於諮詢案舉行最後討論之結果滿場一致决定附以嚴重之警告通過條約案</p>
<p>電通社十七日東京電　政府方面對樞府擬採[審議不能]之態度益表示強硬即樞府部內亦有相當之異論無論伊東委員長如何頑強其統率之委員會亦幾無法統制即在本會議付表决時樞府方面亦難得勝利伊東委員長有見及此考慮失敗時之面目問題對於審議不能之舉似已斷念擬以何等方法謀妥協之策此由伊東委員長容納倉富議長之意見與二上翰長協議之結果即命二上氏於十六日歷訪久保田荒井山川河合黑田各顧問官題聽取意見故有此形勢之轉換今日之委員會將拋棄審議中止之方針僅協議條約之可否伊東委員長所持妥協案之內容有二一用巧妙之文字婉曲轉圜二附以嚴重之警告通過條約案將於二者之中擇一行之而以用後者之說為稍有力政府方面亦以樞府政府正面衝突之結果將於憲政史上起重大之危機砦為憂慮故急欲得元老之諒解江木鐵相於昨日午後赴鄉殿場訪西園寺公報告並說明委員會之經過及政府之决意叩詢老公之意見並要求諒解政府方面已確信得元老重臣等之支持决始終照旣定方會進行</p>

<p>電通社十七日東京電　伊東委員長翩然變計不再堅持[不能審查]態度突然豹變故難局今已豁然開朗軍縮條約已定附驚告可决其致此經過除各顧問之奔走外伊東委員長亦於今朝招審井男至其私宅提示其赴本日委員會腹案乞其諒解平沼欲議長亦招至河合大將有所商酌倉富平沼正副議長伊東委員長二上翰長四人更於十一時半在樞府事務局會合作最後協議於此成為問題者即樞府警告之形式及內容在政府以為樞府之警告倘將引起將來政治上波動自不能囫圇承受惟以樞府旣觀風色豹變態度想不致再有如是固執比較頗持樂觀伊東委員長意固欲附以嚴厲警告帶有彈劾政府意味惟委員及委員外顧問官中難免有持反對者故伊東委員長之意見仍恐不易實現結局樞府將成為完全讓步也</p>
<p>電通社十七日東京電　伊東委員長之態度豹變原因由不能支持樞部內統一亦屬一因而尤重要者厥為西園寺公牧野內府等元老重臣表示反對因而屈服據元老等意見以日本刻財界經濟界正直罹危機無故引起政變非國家之利對於樞府之強硬態度有所制肘故云</p>

<p>華人</p>
<h3>遠征足球隊有返國說</h3>
<p>聞已由星啓程北返</p>
<p>中止赴歐有兩原因</p>
<p>丨對南華不合作亦有表明丨</p>
<p>樂華組織之華人遠征足球隊滿擬橫掃南洋再探歐洲之虛實不料最近聞有由新加坡返國之說且已在途中云云蓋此次遠征樂華基本隊員僅九人此外邀請香港南華中華兩會之球員加入以厚實力惟南華中華方面忽背前議不與合作以致樂華十分為難且樂華為上海西人足球會之會員而該會章程中凡會員欲往地處比賽者須得本會　許可一條此次樂華出國並未通知西人會西人會亦未加可否但遠征隊赴歐比賽因之發生障碍云</p>
<h3>南華隊之表白</h3>
<p>（八月二十五日新加坡通迅）此次南華隊員之不加入中華遠征足球隊値得吾國體育界之注意故記者曾多方刺探以告國人前次已有南華副領隊余巨言君之談話寄滬詳述南華不參加遠征之表明是手續不合經濟無保障及有職業關係三項想閱者尚能記憶故遠征隊回叻時記者特前往該隊寄住之南天酒店訪問余衡之君惟余君之意此乃過去之事不欲多說經記者之固請彼乃云隊員之用度自屬隊中供給無論任何隊員茍欲半途回國者該隊均可押準備金其回國故云經費不足時隊員無水脚回國一層實不成問題至於職業嫌疑一語更不成問題云云記者又問余衡之君曰彼向南華借隊員加入遠征而南華隊謂其手續不合究竟如何余君云遠征隊事前得葉北華李天生馮景祥之同意事後亦有函致南華體育會記者遂問其有覆信否余君曰至今尚未得覆云云記者方再欲作其他之問答時而在旁之隨軍醫士關健安君高聲曰[先生豈以為香港隊員是絕對高明而上海隊員全是笨伯嗎]記者乃不再多問遂興辭退</p>
<p>惟此簡單之消息自然不能以實余稿故翌晨往訪其隊員作閒談於無意中得悉南華隊員個人）即葉馮李三君以前確同意前往歐洲者即服裝費亦已領去是李葉馮三君之不成行或許為南洋會之阻吾國體育界之意見不一致値得吾人之研究也</p>
<p>又前日中華隊到叻時遠征隊隊員陳光耀君（彼之母隊為中華隊）亦前去歡迎記者適與彼同車故與彼作簡單之談話余問陳君與曹桂成何以獨願加入遠征隊（因陳曹二君本為中華隊之一對　也陳君云吾人做事應該放大眼光豈可因一會之關係而消滅個人之志乎我之加入歐行實欲多識世故觀光全球人生幸事也云云余更問其此行遠征隊有否津貼等給予隊員陳君云吾人此行除舟車費外不受隊中給予任何金錢亦無所謂冿貼故有人疑吾人或受職員之嫌疑者可以無慮須知吾人何時不欲參加何時可以回國身體絕對自由云云</p>
<p>又此次遠征隊回新嘉坡已不在班斯吧讓胡文虎別墅居住因該隊以中華隊已到兩隊同居自然不便故寄居華人旅店首屈一指之南天旅店三樓矣</p>
<p>隊員行動亦未見有特別可以告讀者因新嘉坡天氣太熱故隊員於日間多在旅內書寫信件等工作惟周賢言與陳虞添兩君則終日埋頭整理其相簿以消晷夏夜間則隊員各約二三同志游玩街道與外界已無多大應酬蓋遠征隊此時已非新客矣（現洋稱新到之僑胞曰新客）</p>
<p>隊員膳食早餐則各隨所好有吃魚生鷄粥者有食麵者不一而足中飯則在旅館內開飯惟晚飯則在珍珠山下之食物攤用膳該地為廣籍人賣飯之惟一地盤下午方開市所有紅燒火肉白斬鷄燒鴨義燒之類以該處為獨優旣經濟又美味故遠征隊趨之在赴吉隆坡前一晚共開兩桌計共五元多些惟小菜已滿席矣較之在胡文虎別墅所享用者又是一翻風味誠有趣也</p>

<p>日本與兩路之賽因日本隊對於中文通告未甚明瞭以致時間　會　鐘指九下始見該隊翩然蒞臨主事者因情有可諒决於延期再戰旋因旣來之則必報以餘趣乃興飛馬作友誼比賽結果飛馬以五對二獲勝</p>
<p>球藝略評精毅與青星之戰精毅大都係日本郵船同人所組織如方克平克強阮耀輝等均係久戰之將抽守均能實力雄厚在本屆香檳中頗有第三四之希望青星係青年會會員所組織雖如羅宅仁張德才等日夜練習然終成立未久出戰經騐尚少故比賽時與平時練習時技術大遜如能加工努力將來大有希望飛馬自日前失敗於紗布後大加討論擊法果然昨晚與花旗銀行乒乓隊戰時各個玩藝大有精彩竟以七對0獲勝</p>

<p>進出品額　查八月分日貨之輸入上海者總額値四千七百萬元而本埠之對日輸出額値三千七百萬元以去年同時期比較輸入為五千三百五十萬元輸出三午八百七十萬元兩相對照則本年日貨來滬不迨去歲矣</p>

<h3>北遊印象（一）</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>飛雪中北行</p>
<p>冬日晨陽的嫩光撫摸着尚在睡眠的上海我們的一輛汽車濺着昨夜的積雪從勞働者們的忙碌中穿過馳往江邊去就在這樣的一瞬中我是和上海握別了</p>
<p>連年被運命搬弄着這回的北行又何嘗不是被運命的搬弄呢雖然我並不是一個運命的屈伏者</p>
<p>在差不多一個月前就接到兩封召我北去的信因為過去飢苦的連績不幸的遭際之襲擊雖然將要飄流到遼遠的關外而那地方正是恐怖着中俄戰爭的近着國邊的區域但為着存了一個希望的憧憬我是下了這冒危險而長征的决心</p>
<p>後來又因為一個最大的原因阻止了我從上海到哈爾濱的路費需要一百元才足夠這個可怕的數目我是沒有法子籌得出</p>
<p>這樣我總以為北行是不能實現了我到南京去尋飯碗誰知一封航空信又把我從南京趕回到上海來原來一位朋友要北歸邀我同行並借給我路費</p>
<p>似乎運命是這樣注定了我不我是在與運命抗爭着啊</p>
<p>靈你應該到北方去這是給你自已去創造的一個很好的機會你不可失了這機會你在南方的連續的愁苦於你自身上有着很大的損失……」朋友們對我這樣說</p>
<p>是我是這樣想着而且决心北行雖然北去後的現象如何我不敢預料是的一個月前老丁來信召我去但他卻不寄路費來現在已經距隔一個月的時期了他也沒有來信也許北方的現象不好不我不應該這樣想此次我能獲得一個旅行的機會不也是一件很高興的事嗎在北方有黑森林有空的沙漠山嶺是永久白色的空中常年飛着雪片……這些將會給我的靈魂以無限偉大的感發並且到那裏我可以比在南方更好更切近的機會去觀察赤俄對於我們民族橫肆焚掠和一切殘暴的情形……</p>
<p>這回我是走了上長征的路了當人們圍着爐消度這顫慄在寒冬的歲尾我正往寒帶長征到常年飛着雪的北方去</p>
<p>我撒脫了謝君與羅君的手沉默地立在舢板上在一次嗚鳴鑼之後輪機開始嚮動船身漸漸地離開碼頭</p>
<h3>悠游在大自然的懷抱裏</h3>
<p>— 華攝</p>
<p>別了上海別了黃浦灘頭友人別了……</p>
<p>碼頭上的人羣漸漸在我的視綫上模糊了上海漸漸地我離開他遠去我拉着陳君（同行的朋友）沈默地走回艙內凝望着那兩件曾跟我在江南流浪數年過在破行裝</p>
<p>遠征開始了我要把你們帶到塞外去那裏沒有被南內吹墜的桃花瓣會跌落到你們的背上那裏是常年飄着雪片啊</p>

<h3>The Anglo-American Plan to Raise the Price of Silver</h3>
<p>Because of the decline in commerce, countries around the world are experiencing economic difficulties and increased unemployment, leading people to attack their governments. This is futile. The opposition party takes this opportunity to engage in political struggle, which easily gains the sympathy of the people. However, even if the government falls because of the attacks and the opposition party takes power, the stagnation of commerce, economic difficulties, and increase in unemployment will remain the same. Why? Because the root cause lies elsewhere. The reason for increased unemployment and economic difficulties is the decline in commerce, which is fundamentally due to the increasing sophistication of machinery and the increased output of goods, while the need for human labor decreases daily. Therefore, regardless of the item, supply exceeds demand. The secondary reason is the high price of gold and the low price of silver. Because most markets for selling goods use silver, the high price of gold and the low price of silver implicitly increases the price of goods, making buyers even less able to afford them. Therefore, the world is already in a time of commercial decline, and the addition of a high price of gold and a low price of silver further exacerbates the decline. Now, Britain and the United States have seen this and want to raise the price of silver to save commerce, which is more effective than simply attacking the government. However, it can only be temporarily reversed and is not a fundamental solution. Unless other avenues are explored for machinery and labor to create new opportunities, instead of focusing solely on manufacturing goods, the future of commerce will inevitably become increasingly dire.</p>

<h3>Supplementary Council of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Representatives of Guatemala, Norway, and Ireland Elected</p>
<p>China Deemed to Have No Preemptive Right</p>
<p>Committee Formed by Member State Representatives</p>
<h3>Researching the Pan-European Plan</h3>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Special dispatch from the Guomin News Agency): China's attempt to secure a seat on the Council of the League of Nations has failed. The three vacancies in the Council left by Cuba, Finland, and Canada have been filled by Guatemala, Norway, and Ireland. Portugal was also among those eliminated, receiving only thirty votes. The vote counts for the three countries were: Guatemala, forty-one votes; Norway, thirty-eight votes; and Ireland, thirty-six votes. The maximum vote count for each election is limited to fifty-two votes. Before the League of Nations convened this morning for the voting, the question of whether China was qualified to be a candidate was raised because China's term on the Council would not expire for another year. The assembly first decided on this issue. At that time, fifty-two countries were present, and twenty-seven countries voted in favor of China's eligibility to be elected. Because this number did not reach two-thirds, the assembly immediately decided that China had no right to request preemptive election. After the Council election concluded, the assembly passed an important resolution on the Pan-European Federation plan. It was agreed that the committee considering France's proposal, in addition to the twenty-seven countries in Europe and the non-member Soviet Russia and Turkey, should also invite several countries outside of Europe to join. Chairman Titulescu also declared that all member states of the League of Nations have the right to participate in the work of this committee and wished the assembly to pay special attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Reuters): This morning, the Assembly of the League of Nations convened to elect non-permanent members of the Administrative Council. In the vote, China received twenty-seven votes, which was less than the required two-thirds majority, so it was not elected. Guatemala, Norway, and the Irish Free State were elected, each for a three-year term. Guatemala received forty-one votes, Norway received thirty-eight votes, and the Irish Free State received thirty-six votes. Portugal received only thirty votes, and according to the rules, it needed thirty-five votes to qualify. The Assembly of the League of Nations then elected a replacement for Hughes as a judge of the International Court of Justice. Kellogg, the Secretary of State during President Coolidge's term, was elected with thirty votes out of forty-seven. The Assembly of the League of Nations then unanimously approved a committee organized by representatives of the European members of the League of Nations to study the Pan-European plan. It invited all European members of the League and the Secretariat of the League to study French Foreign Minister Briand's proposal and advocated that all non-European countries that had joined the League and European countries that had not joined the League should be consulted.</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Reuters): French Prime Minister Briand's proposal for a European Federation has now entered an interesting phase. The twenty-seven European countries attending the discussion of the proposal have submitted a draft resolution requesting the Assembly of the League of Nations to convene all European countries and the International Secretariat to further study the French Prime Minister's proposal and advocate that all non-member European countries and member non-European countries should be consulted. These twenty-seven countries believe that the proposal should be drafted as soon as possible for submission to next year's Assembly of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Reuters): The general discussion of the League of Nations Assembly concluded this evening. The Indian representative, Piganar Maharaja, and the Polish Foreign Minister, Chai, and the Romanian Foreign Minister, Mironescu, all delivered speeches. A total of fourteen speakers today spoke about disarmament, security, and international goodwill. In the afternoon, the French representative submitted a proposal regarding the European Federation plan. Its intention was merely to postpone Briand's plan until the next Assembly, but the wording was cautious, expressing gratitude for the efforts of European countries in realizing this plan and authorizing countries outside the League of Nations, namely Soviet Russia and Turkey, to negotiate detailed plans and create a concrete plan. It is worth noting that this year's proposal did not include the provision of last year's proposal that the European Federation must adhere to the principles contained in the League's charter (i.e., the territorial integrity of each member state and the immutability of treaties). This proposal will be voted on in the general assembly tomorrow morning, and according to the rules, approximately two-thirds of the votes are required for passage.</p>
<p>News reporters attended the usual luncheon for key figures of the Administrative Council, including Henderson, Briand, and Courtius. Henderson and Briand both gave speeches praising Courtius's speech in the morning. Henderson further praised Briand's tireless dedication to peace and stated that there were no differences of opinion between Britain and France. Briand then rose to speak, briefly stating that representatives of various countries had been working diligently in Geneva and that no one had asked them to disregard the best interests of their own countries. Briand then turned his gaze to Courtius and said, "Dr. Courtius is both French and loyal to our country. I, with the culture and history of France, dare to guarantee that I will never seize any concessions from my colleague Courtius that would be contrary to German interests." Briand then praised the achievements of the late German Chancellor Stresemann and called on politicians of all countries to combine all national interests into international interests, as only this could maintain lasting peace.</p>

<p>Breaking Through the Current Difficulties</p>
<p>Privy Council Review Committee</p>
<p>Final Discussion Results</p>
<h3>Decision to Pass the Treaty Bill</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric News Agency): Today's Privy Council Review Committee was attended only by the Privy Council members. It convened at 1:00 PM and adjourned at 2:50 PM. As a result of the final discussion on the consultation, it was unanimously decided to pass the treaty bill with a serious warning attached.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric News Agency): The government has become increasingly adamant about the Privy Council's intended stance of "unable to deliberate." There is also considerable dissent within the Privy Council. No matter how stubborn Chairman Ito is, his command of the committee is almost impossible, and even when the matter is put to a vote at this meeting, the Privy Council is unlikely to win. Chairman Ito, seeing this, is considering the issue of his public image in the event of failure and seems to have abandoned the idea of not deliberating. He intends to seek a compromise through some means. This is the result of Chairman Ito accepting Speaker Kuratomi's opinion and consulting with Chief Secretary Futakami. Futakami visited advisors Kubota, Arai, Yamakawa, Kawai, and Kuroda on the 16th to solicit their opinions, hence this shift in the situation. Today's committee will abandon the policy of suspending deliberation and only discuss whether the treaty is acceptable. Chairman Ito's compromise proposal has two parts: 1. To use clever wording to subtly change the situation. 2. To pass the treaty bill with a serious warning attached. He will choose one of the two options, with the latter being slightly more likely. The government is also concerned that the result of a direct confrontation between the Privy Council and the government will create a major crisis in constitutional history, so it urgently wants to obtain the understanding of the elder statesmen. Minister of Railways Eguchi visited Prince Saionji in Gotemba yesterday afternoon to report and explain the committee's progress and the government's determination, seeking the elder statesman's opinion and requesting understanding. The government is confident that it has the support of the elder statesmen and influential figures and is determined to proceed with the established policy from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric News Agency): Regarding the Privy Council Review Committee's consultation on the disarmament treaty, according to subsequent confirmed information, the Privy Council has decided to approve it unconditionally and wants to avoid adding a warning, only inserting phrases that the Privy Council hopes for in the conclusion of the report.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric News Agency): Chairman Ito's sudden change of plan, no longer insisting on the "unable to review" attitude, suddenly turned the difficult situation into a clear path. The disarmament treaty has been set to be approved with a warning. The reason for this development, in addition to the efforts of various advisors, is that Chairman Ito also invited Vice Minister Ide to his private residence this morning, presented him with the internal plan for today's committee, and asked for his understanding. Chairman Hiruma also invited General Kawai to consult. Speaker Kuratomi, Vice Speaker Hiruma, Chairman Ito, and Chief Secretary Futakami held a final meeting at the Privy Council Secretariat at 11:30 AM. The issue became the form and content of the Privy Council's warning. The government believes that if the Privy Council's warning causes political fluctuations in the future, it cannot accept it wholesale. However, since the Privy Council has changed its attitude, it is unlikely to be as stubborn, and a more optimistic view is held. Chairman Ito intended to attach a severe warning with the implication of impeaching the government, but some committee members and external advisors inevitably held opposing views, so Chairman Ito's opinion is still feared to be difficult to realize. In the end, the Privy Council will make a complete concession.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric News Agency): The reason for Chairman Ito's change of attitude is that he could not maintain unity within the Privy Council, which is also a factor. More importantly, the elder statesmen such as Prince Saionji and Marquis Makino expressed opposition and thus yielded. According to the opinions of the elder statesmen, Japan is currently facing a crisis in the financial and economic circles, and causing political change for no reason is not in the interest of the country. They restrained the Privy Council's strong attitude.</p>
<p>Warsaw Labor Unions</p>
<h3>General Strike for 24 Hours</h3>
<p>Protesting Government Arrests of Opposition Party Members</p>
<p>City Enters Martial Law State</p>
<p>Warsaw, 16th (Special dispatch from the Guomin News Agency): Labor unions in the capital of Poland today announced a general strike of twenty-four hours to protest the government's mass arrests of key figures in the opposition party. Except for streetcar and city business workers, all others have obeyed the strike order. For a time, the entire city entered a state of martial law, with patrols carrying guns shuttling through the streets to disperse striking workers gathered on the roadside. The situation is very tense. Although this general strike is only for twenty-four hours, it has greatly surprised the authorities because they believe that the masses are powerless and that they can meekly accept the dictator's orders after their leaders are removed. They also believe that the left-wing parties have no courage to actively oppose the military government except for empty words. Unexpectedly, there was a general strike.</p>
<h3>Russian Coal Miners Riot</h3>
<p>Attempts to Improve by Hiring German Workers</p>
<p>Sparks Jealousy, Workshop Destroyed</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th (Special dispatch from the Guomin News Agency): Coal miners in the Donets region, greatly dissatisfied that five hundred German workers received better treatment, were given special workshops to live in, and their wages and food were superior to those of local workers, suddenly rioted and destroyed the workshops. Twenty-one German workers were injured. These German workers are all communist party members who were newly recruited from Germany to improve coal mining methods and increase production. When they first arrived last month, all the workers warmly welcomed them, calling them revolutionary comrades. Unexpectedly, the enthusiasm of welcome quickly turned into jealousy, eventually leading to the destruction of the workshops. The German workers are now protected by the Red Army, but whether they can continue to work is uncertain.</p>
<h3>German Cabinet Decides to Remain in Office</h3>
<p>To Proceed with Handling Various Cases</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Reuters): The Bruning cabinet has unanimously decided to remain in office and will proceed with its procedures for handling economic, financial, and social issues. It will submit proposals regarding these matters when the new cabinet convenes on October 13th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Special dispatch from the Guomin News Agency): The German cabinet has unanimously decided not to resign and has obtained the president's approval. It will determine its course of action after observing the situation in the new parliament. It has ordered various ministries to compile the government's economic, financial, and social policies into proposals to be submitted to the new parliament immediately after it opens on October 13th. Although this method is unconventional, it does not directly conflict with the constitution, and most newspapers have expressed support, viewing it as a good omen for Chancellor Bruning's determination to persist and implement the necessary reforms for the country. It is also heard that the cabinet's resolution has left sufficient room for Bruning to consult with the Social Democrats to join the cabinet or provide substantial support to maintain the cabinet's position in parliament. A certain party newspaper commented on the election, saying that the parliamentary re-election cost the country and various parties a lot. Assuming that the election expenses paid by the national treasury this time are the same as the previous election, they will reach 1,556,800 marks. Most parties do not disclose their expenses. Only the Social Democrats published their election expense accounts. It was found that the party spent a total of 2,569,612 marks in the previous election, averaging 0.27 marks per vote and about 16,500 marks per seat. In addition, only the Center Party has the powerful support of the Catholic Church, and its election expenses may be slightly more than the Social Democrats. It is unlikely that the German National People's Party will spend less than the Social Democrats. The Nationalist Party used an average of 0.60 marks per vote in a certain election in the past, and the Democratic Party used as much as 1.25 marks. Based on this estimate, the total cost of this election should be several million.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Special dispatch from the Guomin News Agency): The stock market here suddenly plummeted yesterday after the election results were announced, but most stocks have rebounded today. It is expected that they will fully recover to their original state in two or three days. Moreover, since the foreign market is not competing to sell German stocks, it is expected that various stocks will easily regain their original credit.</p>

<p>Bombay, 17th (Reuters): Criminal Investigation Department personnel simultaneously searched nine offices of the Red Flag Association and the Young Workers' Union this morning. The residences of Miss Chedubaia, the principal of a Bombay girls' school, and Mrs. Nambiar were also among them. Chedubaia is the sister of Mrs. Naidu, who is currently imprisoned.

<h3>Canadian Relief for Unemployment</h3>
<p>Ottawa, 16th (Reuters): The Canadian House of Commons passed the third reading of a bill to allocate $20 million to relieve unemployment, to be used for public works and emergency relief. As for the government's bill to crack down on the flooding of foreign goods, which aims to reduce unemployment, it has now passed its first reading. This bill involves an increase in tax rates, especially on textiles, agricultural implements, copper and ironware, and heating and electrical appliances. Britain is affected by taxes on cotton and woolen goods, but the original regulations stipulating that goods with 50% British products and labor are eligible for preferential tax rates have been amended to reduce the percentage to 33 and 1/3, so Lancashire yarn is not severely affected. Imports from the United States and other European countries are taxed more heavily than British goods. This tax must be implemented, but goods that have not yet been cleared or are in transit are exempt from the tax increase.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Development of the Battle on the Pinghan Railway Line</h3>
<p>Distribution of the Fifth Column</p>
<p>He and Liu Serve as Commanders</p>
<p>The battle on the Pinghan Railway Line: Since the Central Army established contact with the Longhai front, the situation has gradually unfolded, and the attack began on the 11th. Initially, after the Central Army captured Jinan, the Longhai line also took advantage of the momentum to advance. The Pinghan line is a key area for both sides to compete for victory. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek has visited Luohe twice to inspect the front line and deliberate on the situation. He decided to adopt a new strategy to change the deployment of the army on that road, dividing it into five columns and a central column, with Liu Zhi and He Chengjun serving as commanders. Before the 11th, they had all separately completed their concentration. After the 11th, the entire line was mobilized. Except for the central route, where progress was slightly delayed due to military relations, both the left and right wings made rapid progress. According to successive reports of victory from the headquarters, the first column has captured Fugou, and Liu Guitang's troops have been completely disarmed. Zheng Dazhang and Sun Lianzhong's troops have also suffered extremely heavy losses. This column is now advancing towards Kaifeng. The second, third, and fourth columns are stationed in Xihua, Lingying, and Xiangcheng, advancing towards Xuchang, Xinzheng, Zhengzhou, Rongyang, and Gongxian. Feng Yuxiang's troops Deng Baoshan and Ren Yingqi have also been defeated. The fifth column advanced from the area of Linru, Dengfeng, and Yuxian, approaching Longmen and advancing towards Luoyang. Many of Feng Yuxiang's troops, including Song Zheyuan and Sun Liangcheng, have been disarmed. In addition, most of the first aviation squadron is concentrated on the front, with squadron leader Zhang Yougu dispatching aircraft to Xuchang and Zhengzhou every day to drop bombs. The fifth armored train squadron, the Xiping Minsheng and Lianghao armored trains, commanded by squadron leader Gu Maolin, protects the army along the railway. The Feng Yuxiang army on the left and right wings is trying to defend firmly, and the central route is also taking a defensive posture. Strong fortifications have been built from Xuchang to Zhengzhou, and orders have been issued to all generals not to abandon Zhengzhou unless absolutely necessary. However, with the Central Army surrounding Zhengzhou and Xuchang on the left and right wings, the Zhengzhou and Xuchang area will be difficult to defend. (September 16th)</p>
<h3>Committing Hunan Communist Bandits Fleeing Towards the Jiangxi Border</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang jointly invaded Hunan this time, launching a major offensive against Changsha. After half a month and seven or eight fierce battles, they were all defeated by the National Army. Zhu De was seriously injured and near death, and there were rumors that Peng Dehuai was also killed by an airplane bombing. Furthermore, their ammunition was running out and food supplies were insufficient (especially salt). The bandits held divergent views and disagreements, and desertions from their ranks increased daily. Starting from the 13th, the bandits began to flee southeast from areas near Changsha. The majority of them advanced along the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang Railway, attacking Liling in an attempt to flee to Pingxiang, Jiangxi. The National Army has dispatched forces to search and advance, and there are no large groups of communist bandits within thirty li of the fortress. Approximately half of the peasants who were coerced have taken the opportunity to escape. The following is an excerpt from the reconnaissance report of the air force team on the 14th, which can provide a glimpse of the situation: (1) Zhang Yuheng and Wu Xingjian, the squadron leaders of the 5th Aviation Team, along with pilots Zhu Hongfei and Yang Xiaolin, flew the Caise No. 3 and Dallas No. 2 aircraft to the Liling area on the afternoon of the 14th to scout the bandit situation. They observed that the bandits who had fled to Longtoupu the previous day were scattered along the lines of Shijiaxia, ​​Meiziyuan, Zhiqianqiao, Fenglinshi, and Huangdazui, fleeing towards Huacaoqiao and Fengshuqiao. Their vanguard had reached Fengshuqiao, while a small detachment split off from Longtoupu and fled towards Zhuzhou, apparently to cover the retreat of the bandits at Fengshuqiao. The planes immediately tracked them and dropped dozens of bombs and incendiary bombs, all of which hit their targets, killing many and littering the roads with corpses. The remaining bandits were terrified and panicked. (2) Qin Zongfan, the squadron leader of the 1st squadron of the 5th Team, and pilot Li Lingyun, flew the Caise No. 4 aircraft from Hankou to the provincial capital on the morning of the 14th. After 3:00 PM, they flew from Xinhae Airport to Fengshuqiao and Liling to inspect the situation. They observed that 30,000 to 40,000 bandits had moved out from Fengshuqiao and were fleeing towards the Jiangxi border. They immediately dropped bombs to attack them fiercely. As the plane moved forward, they saw about 2,000 bandits advancing towards Liling City from Wulipai. The remaining thousands of bandits fled along the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang Railway towards Pingxiang. Their vanguard had reached Fuchongpu and Yingtaoling, moving hastily without stopping. They appeared extremely disorganized. (3) Squadron Leader Zhang Yuheng and others twice flew the Caise No. 3 and Dallas No. 2 aircraft to Yijiawan, Muyunshi, Laodaokou, Langlishi, Dongshan, Baiyanpu, and Tiaomajian to inspect the situation. They found that all areas were quiet and no trace of bandits was found. However, it appeared that a few remnant bandits were lingering in Pujishi, possibly farmers and laborers who had been coerced and were hesitating on the crossroads, wanting to escape from the fiery pit. It is also possible that (4) Squadron Leader Qin Zongfan twice and Squadron Leader Zhang Yuheng three times flew to Liling to continue reconnaissance. They confirmed that there were no bandits north of Longtoupu. The bandits from Fengshuqiao to Yingtaoling were running frantically, one after another. It is said that the bandit party learned that our Jiangxi army had cut off their return route, the provincial capital garrison was preparing to attack, and the central government had dispatched three more divisions to reinforce. The bandits were like ants on a hot pot, suffering from the hardship of having nowhere to go, and had to flee madly to seize the road to escape to their old nest in order to prolong their lives. (5) Squadron Leader Zhang Yuheng flew the Caise No. 3 aircraft to Yijiawan and Tiaomajian on the morning of the 13th to侦炸. He threw multiple incendiary bombs at the location of the bandit military headquarters in Baiyanpu Yangjia Ancestral Hall. He immediately saw the walls of the bandit military headquarters collapsing, the houses catching fire, and the bandits inside fleeing in a chaotic manner. The plane then descended to a low altitude and opened fire with machine guns. Few of those who escaped from the bandit military headquarters survived. The next day, a small vendor selling red peppers came from Dongshan and said that the bandit party was spreading rumors that Peng Dehuai was indeed killed by the bombing of the military headquarters. Therefore, the Red Bandits, upon hearing the news, fled towards Liling in an extremely disorganized manner. (September 15th)</p>
<h3>Tang Shengming and Others Again Show Loyalty to He Jian</h3>
<p>He Orders Them to Move to Dong'an to Await Orders</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The remnants of the Guangxi clique, including Tang Shengming, Li Zemin, Yan Renyi, and Feng Tianzhu, took advantage of the concentration of the Fourth Route Army in Changsha to suppress bandits and the emptiness of southern Hunan to flee into Hengbin. He Jian immediately dispatched Duan Heng's brigade from Hengzhou to intercept them, and also dispatched Zhang Liangji's brigade of the Sixteenth Division to strike from the side in Baoqing. On the 10th, Qiyang was recaptured, and the pseudo-brigade commander Chen Dunhe and regimental commander Tang Shenghan were killed. Tang Shengming's remnant forces fled towards Yongzhou. Yesterday, Tang and others sent a telegram from Yongzhou to express their loyalty and request that the Fourth Route Army incorporate them. The telegram stated that they only asked that their troops be reorganized into three regiments so that the soldiers would have a place to belong, and that they themselves had no ulterior motives. Whether Tang and others were sincere in this telegram or whether it was a delaying tactic is still unknown. However, for the sake of peace in southern Hunan, He Jian replied in a telegram, allowing Tang and others to withdraw from Yongzhou and move to Dong'an, and then send personnel to the province to discuss the matter. The telegram was signed by Division Commander Tang Shengming, Yan Renyi, Brigade Commander Wang Yi, and Chief of Staff Chen Bishu. Therefore, He Jian's reply was only addressed to Tang and the other four. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: [Urgent Telegram to Dong'an, Yongzhou to Tang Jifeng (Shengming), Yan Bogang (Renyi), Chen Bishu, and Wang Zhuangbo (Yi), Esteemed Sirs: I have received your telegram with great joy. Previously, you brothers sent several telegrams from Wugang and sent representative Zheng Shaohou to the province with a letter, expressing your unanimous determination to eliminate the communists and not take the opportunity to cause trouble. I replied with praise and entrusted Mr. Zheng to convey my appreciation. Unexpectedly, the ink was not yet dry, the messenger was on the way, and the alarm arrived that Yongqi had fallen and Hengbao was in urgent danger. At that time, our army was fighting a bloody battle with the communist bandits in the suburbs of Changsha. Everyone in the country thought that you brothers were taking advantage of the danger to create chaos and colluding with the communist bandits from afar, blaming He for not taking care of both. Although He loves you brothers, he really cannot but love the local area, and even more cannot but love the people. Therefore, he sent troops from Hengbao to barely defend it. Now, I read your telegram and still say that you have no ulterior motives. He has always treated people with sincerity and is willing to let you brothers realize this as soon as possible. I dare to ask you to quickly lead your troops to retreat to Dong'an and send a suitable person to the province. If He can be responsible for you brothers, he will do his best. A special reply from He Jian with the official seal] (15th)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Hubei Provincial Security Office</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The preparation for the Hubei Provincial Security Office has been underway for a long time. The establishment was delayed due to financial difficulties. After the Three Provinces Pacification Conference, the suppression of bandits and the clearing of villages became the immediate priority.

<h3>Guangzhou: Restaurant Closures Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Three Arrested Restaurateurs Released</p>
<p>Authorities Still Do Not Intend to Revoke Joint Receipt System</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangzhou restaurant industry has been unanimously suspending business since the 6th in protest of the joint receipt system implemented by the donation merchants, awaiting a decision. On that day, a total of more than 250 restaurants were closed in the city. On the second day (the 7th), more than 20 Western restaurants and other establishments joined in. On the third day, even those who specialized in catering without retail storefronts closed their doors one after another. Only five or six flower banquet restaurants in Chentang were not unanimous in suspending business due to special circumstances. However, the strike trend has become unstoppable. In order to maintain contact, the restaurant owners, including Chen Fuchou, the manager of Nanyuan, Lin Ji, the manager of Wenyuan, and Ye Shaogu, the manager of Moshan Pavilion, held a banquet meeting at the Yongchun Lou Yongyu Hall in Chentang at 10:00 PM on the 7th to deal with the donation merchants. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was discovered by the donation merchants, who reported to the special task force of the Department of Finance, accusing the restaurateurs of inciting the strike. That evening, the special task force dispatched a team to surround Yongchun Lou and arrested the three men, detaining them at the Department of Finance for interrogation. After Chen, Lin, and Ye were detained, all the restaurant owners who had already suspended business fled, fearing for their safety. They believed that Chen and others were innocent and should not have been arrested arbitrarily. Therefore, each store sent one representative, totaling more than 200 people, to the provincial government at 3:00 PM on the 8th to petition and jointly elect District Someone and others as the five people responsible for meeting with Chen Mingshu, the chairman of the provincial government. Chen was unable to meet due to other business, so he sent Secretary Lei Jiyun to receive the restaurant representatives. The restaurant representatives explained that the restaurant strike was due to the joint receipt system implemented by the donation merchants, which the entire industry considered to be harsh and difficult to implement, and that the unanimous strike was out of public opinion. Now that Chen and others had been suddenly arrested by the Department of Finance, it was unjust, and they requested that they be released to redress the injustice. If the government could immediately revoke the joint receipt system, the restaurant industry would resume business. Secretary Lei promised to convey the situation to the chairman and reassured them before sending the petitioning group away. On the same day, the provincial authorities instructed the Department of Finance to interrogate the three merchants who had been detained and release them after they had given a written guarantee. Around 5:00 PM that evening, the interrogation section of the Department of Finance brought the three men up for interrogation. Each of them strongly denied inciting the strike. The official said that if they had not incited the strike, the restaurant owners related to the detainees should resume business first to show their sincerity. Chen and others immediately agreed and personally provided a written guarantee with their seals, acknowledging the resumption of business. Around 6:00 PM, Chen and others were finally released. Earlier, when the petitioning group returned from the provincial government, they stated that the joint receipt system case would be submitted to the provincial affairs meeting for resolution on the 9th. However, during the 111th meeting on the morning of the 9th, only reports were given, and the joint receipt system case was not included in the agenda. Only Fan Qiwu, the director of the Department of Finance, reported on the handling of the joint receipt system case and explained the reasons for the dispute. The chairman said that now that a strike had occurred, it was best to resolve it as soon as possible. If the restaurant industry was willing to suspend business, the government would only have to wait for them to come to their senses. However, if there were any threats to suspend business, the government would have to deal with them severely. The result of the discussion was that the entire case was still handed over to the Department of Finance for handling. According to sources from the Department of Finance, the financial authorities do not seem to intend to revoke the original plan. Therefore, the restaurant industry plans to petition various agencies again today. (September 10th)</p>
<h3>The Turmoil of the Tianjin Customs' Seizure of the Boxer Indemnity</h3>
<p>Used to Fund Eight Schools</p>
<p>Gillis Opposes Seizure</p>
<p>Simpson Rashly Seizes Funds</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After Simpson took over Tianjin Customs on June 16th, a strike broke out on the 21st. The Chang Customs also took similar action. The diplomatic corps attached great importance to this. Later, Simpson handled the matter properly, and the diplomatic corps also understood that the 5% ad valorem tax levied by the Sea Customs and Chang Customs was still remitted to the Inspector General of Customs and did not affect the fund for foreign debts, so they took a wait-and-see attitude and did not intervene. However, the more than 200 Chinese staff members of the Sea Customs were paid monthly by the Inspector General of Customs. Every day, they had almost nothing to do except go to the club to play billiards. Everyone was very anxious. Former Customs Commissioner Bile went to Shanghai to ask the Inspector General of Customs to transfer him to other customs stations. As of now, only four academically excellent people have been transferred, one to Harbin, one to Qingdao, and two to Shanghai. As for the Chang Customs, the strike lasted for two days. After persuasion, all the workers resumed work. Customs Commissioner Bi Luo was dismissed by Yan Xishan, and Ge Jingyou was appointed to replace him. Later, it was found that Ge was in contact with the South, so Ge was transferred to the Taiyuan headquarters as a senior civil servant, and Lu Jinli was appointed to replace him. Time flies, and more than two months have passed. The new customs officers hired by Simpson have been trained and practiced for two months, and everything is on track. Unexpectedly, recently, the Ministry of Education in Nanjing has not paid the expenses of the eight schools in Beiping for several months. Simpson wanted to ingratiate himself with Yan Xishan, so he suggested that 350,000 yuan be withheld from the Tianjin Chang Customs every month to fund the eight schools. Yan immediately agreed and telegraphed Simpson to do so. This happened on September 5th. On the 6th, Simpson telegraphed the Shanghai Inspector General of Customs, stating that the expenses of the eight schools in Beiping were not available, and that he was ordered to allocate 350,000 yuan per month to fund the expenses. If there were any objections, please reply within three days. Otherwise, he would implement the plan as scheduled. Former Deputy Customs Commissioner Gillis received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing and the Shanghai Inspector General of Customs on the morning of the 9th, opposing the seizure of the Tianjin Customs' regular taxes to fund the eight schools. In the afternoon, Gillis visited Simpson. Simpson had gone to Beiping and not returned. He visited again on the morning of the 10th and, on behalf of Nanjing, issued a written warning to Simpson, with strong wording. The main points are translated as follows: (1) Since the abolition of the Sino-Russian Boxer Indemnity Committee, the power to dispose of the Boxer Indemnity is not in the hands of the Inspector General of Customs, but in the hands of the legitimate government of the Republic of China, which is recognized by all countries in the world. It is a fundamental mistake to consult the Inspector General of Customs. (2) The Boxer Protocol stipulates that the indemnity belonging to Russia is paid from the 5% ad valorem tax levied by all Chang Customs (including Tianjin Chang Customs). However, the amount that Tianjin Chang Customs should pay to Russia every month is less than 350,000 yuan. If you want to withhold 350,000 yuan every month, you will have to embezzle the 5% ad valorem tax of the Sea Customs to make up for it. This matter has exceeded the scope of the Boxer Protocol, and you should be held responsible for destroying the customs precedents. (3) According to the Sino-Russian Conference Treaty of 1924, the use of the portion of the Boxer Indemnity returned by Russia is only for the purpose of running Chinese cultural enterprises, and it does not specify that it should be allocated to the expenses of the eight schools in Beiping, nor does it specify the amount. There is no basis for you to withhold 350,000 yuan every month. (4) The 5% ad valorem tax levied by the national customs is not enough to repay foreign debts. Now you want to withhold the Boxer Indemnity from the Chang Customs and infringe on the customs' regular taxes, making the fund for repaying foreign debts even more insufficient. You should be held responsible for shaking the foundation of the foreign debt fund. Simpson also refuted each point the next day: (1) The Inspector General of Customs has no right to dispose of the Russian Boxer Indemnity. I know this well, so the telegram I sent was a notice, not a request for instructions. I am handling the procedures under the order of the Northern government, and there is nothing inappropriate. (2) After the Sino-Japanese War at the end of the Qing Dynasty, China borrowed a lot of money. The regular customs revenue was not enough to repay foreign debts, and there was a monthly difference of more than 2 million. Therefore, it was decided that all the banknote customs (later renamed Chang Customs) within 50 miles of the customs所在地 should be under the jurisdiction of the customs, and all the revenue should be used by the customs to repay foreign debts. If we now forcibly divide them, there is a lack of reason. (3) The decision to allocate the Boxer Indemnity to the expenses of the eight schools every month was made by the Nanjing government. Now that the Nanjing government is not paying the expenses, the Northern government should continue to allocate it in order to maintain the life of education. (4) Whether the national customs revenue is not enough to repay foreign debts is another matter. This time, the monthly deduction of 350,000 yuan from the revenue of the Chang Customs for the expenses of the eight schools will not actually affect the customs' regular taxes. Moreover, I am handling it under orders, and the Northern government is responsible for it. On the 12th, Gillis received another telegram from Nanjing, instructing him to continue to protest. Gillis immediately summoned important officials to discuss the matter. At first, he advocated publishing a notice in Chinese and foreign newspapers to deny Simpson's seizure of customs duties to fund the eight schools. Later, because the advertising fee was too high, he changed to sending the warning letter to Simpson to the major Chinese and foreign newspapers for publication in the form of news. However, most of the Chinese newspapers in the city did not publish it in its original form. Only the English-language North China Star and the Tianjin Times published it. Now the faculty and students of the eight schools are helping Simpson, so Simpson's attitude is very firm. From last Thursday to this Thursday, the regular taxes that the Sea Customs and Chang Customs should have remitted to the Inspector General of Customs, about 300,000 yuan, have been stopped in preparation for allocating them to the expenses of the eight schools next Tuesday. However, although Simpson is　anticipating, he is also very apprehensive, given Gillis' strong attitude, fearing that he will overreact and cause a diplomatic incident. Therefore, he took a train to Beiping on the evening of the 12th to discuss a stable plan with Zhu Hexiang and the faculty of the eight schools. Zhu also declared to the press in Beiping that the expenses of the eight schools in Beiping are paid monthly by the Inspector General of Customs from the Russian Boxer Indemnity, and 350,000 yuan is transferred to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing. Now the ministry has not transferred it for four months, causing the eight schools in Beiping to stop. In order to maintain the life of education in the eight schools, Yan Xishan decided to order the customs to withhold 350,000 yuan every month, and at the same time ask the Inspector General of Customs to transfer an account. The amount withheld in Tianjin is the same as the amount paid by the Inspector General of Customs to the Ministry of Education every month. The payment of foreign debts by the Inspector General of Customs is not affected in any way. It is natural that withholding it in Tianjin will not affect it either. This principle is very clear, etc.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that Gillis asked Jameson, the British Consul General in Tianjin, to stop Simpson from withholding the customs duties. Jameson said that if there is something inappropriate about Tianjin Customs withholding funds, the diplomatic corps should protest and negotiate. The consul is not in a position to intervene before receiving instructions from the British Minister due to his official powers. Judging from the current situation of both sides, Gillis' verbal opposition is more likely to fail, and the North is also apprehensive, fearing that he will alarm foreigners and cause them to intervene, which will inevitably lead to a deadlock and make it impossible to step down.

<h3>Large Quantity of Opium Seized on the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Beining Railway had previously uncovered two opium smuggling cases, both within the trains. Unexpectedly, on the 11th of this month, a batch of opium was again seized on Express Train No. 104 departing from Shanhaiguan for Shenyang. It started when a police officer accompanying the train, Officer Wu, noticed three wicker packages boarded from Xingcheng, followed by another three wicker packages boarded from Baimiaozi. All packages had luggage tags, but the wicker packages were suspiciously heavy. When the train arrived at Jin County Station, the police officer immediately reported to the Jin County Police Section Chief, who then had the wicker packages unloaded from the baggage car for public inspection. The packages were found to contain a total of 937 catties of opium. Investigation revealed that Liang Yuguang, the train guard, was involved in the case. Liang and the opium were taken into custody. Telegrams were dispatched to the Beining Railway Bureau, Tianjin General Bureau, and the bureau's Shenyang office. Subsequently, a telegram from Shenyang instructed that Liang and the opium be transported to Shenyang. The Jin County Police Section then dispatched officers on the 12th to escort them to the Beining Railway Bureau's Shenyang office for interrogation. (12th)</p>
<h3>400,000 Flood Victims in Western Liaoning</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Jinghui, Chief Executive of the Harbin Special District, has shown great concern for the floods in Western Liaoning. On the 8th of this month, he telegraphed the Liaoning Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stating that he had convened representatives from all sectors of the special district to raise funds for disaster relief, with a target of 200,000 yuan. The funds are currently being collected, and upon completion, they will be transferred to the Liaoning Provincial Emergency Relief Association for distribution. He requested a detailed report on the severity of the disaster in each affected county and the number of disaster victims in each county. Chen Wenxue, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, received the telegram.

<h3>Harbin Tram Network Plan</h3>
<p>To be completed throughout the city within twelve years</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Harbin Electric Company, formerly a joint government-business venture, was reorganized this year into the government-run Electric Bureau. The director remains the previous general manager, Li Tieshan, whose management has been quite successful. As a result, both the Japanese Denki K.K. (Electric Joint-Stock Company) and the French Yong Sheng Electric Company have lost their competitive edge. Although North Manchuria (Bei Man) intends to cede its assets to the Electric Bureau, negotiations have repeatedly failed due to significant price differences, and they are still struggling. The electric lighting company on the Daowai Binjiang County border was acquired by the bureau last autumn, and a branch office was established for operation. Thus, the Harbin electric power industry has achieved a unified trend. As for the tramway operated by the bureau, it is currently scheduled to complete the city's tram network within twelve years, constructing one station each year. With Qinjiagang as the center, it will extend in all four directions: Daoli, Daowai, Xiangfang, and Gu Xiangtun New Anbu. The second phase, from Daoli Shitoudao to Daowai Xu Highway, has been delayed because the Dongtie Hengdao Kou culvert has not been repaired. The general plan for each phase is as follows: Phase 1, the main line from Majiagou General Factory to Daoli Police Street and the branch line connecting from Nangang corner to the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, completed on Double Tenth Day in 1927. Phase 2, adding a double track from Nangang to Majiagou, completed in the spring of 1928. Phase 3, from Nangang Hospital Street intersection to Daowai Zhengyang Street intersection, completed in the winter of 1929. Phase 4, from Daowai Zhengyang Street intersection via Daowai Old Jiangdi to 16th Street, scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. Phase 5, from Majiagou Tongdao Street to Xiangfang, scheduled to be open to traffic in 1931. Phase 6, if the Kan Tieyi eight-station culvert is built, the road from Daoli will be built first; otherwise, the Xiangfang road will be reserved for modification. Phase 7, from Daoli East Police Street, extend west to Paodui Street, enter Xiewen Street, and fold back to Xincheng Avenue intersection, scheduled to be open to traffic in 1933. Phase 8, from Xiewen Street to Xin'anbu, 1934. Phase 9, from the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau to Gu Xiangtun, 1935. Phase 10, from Daowai 16th Street, two lines will go uphill from Jile Temple via Dajing Street to Qiulin, scheduled to be completed in 1936. Phase 11, from Daowai 16th Street, extend east to Binjiang Park, scheduled to be completed in 1937. Phase 12, from Daowai South 16th Street, turn into Taigu Street and enter Nanma Road, scheduled to be completed in 1938. (12th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Transfer of the Water Police Detachment: The first detachment of the first district of the Shanghai Provincial Public Security Water Police was previously stationed in various locations from Minhang, including Tinglin and Zhu Jing. In case of emergencies, they would be dispatched for patrols. Now, gentry and merchants from Jinshan County point out that bandits can easily appear and disappear along the branching waterways of the county. They believe a stationed detachment is necessary for defense. Therefore, they petitioned the provincial authorities to transfer Detachment Leader Fan of the first detachment to Zhu Jing to guard against bandits, and to transfer Gong Guozhen's detachment to Songjiang as a replacement. It is heard that the provincial authorities have approved this and will implement it next month.</p>
<p>Embezzlement in the Ninth District's Rice Sales: Chen Ziwen, the district chief of the ninth district (Little Kunshan) of the county, was tasked with managing the government-subsidized rice sales upon taking office.

It is heard that the points of embezzlement discovered include: the subsidized rice sales in the district were stopped on the 25th of last month, and the district chief issued a notice. However, on the 26th, he reported to the Bureau that he had continued to purchase 360 bags of Xian rice. Also, 18 bags of unsold subsidized rice were found hidden in the home of the former Administrative Bureau Chief, Zhu. Another five bags were sold by the district to the Beihuitong Rice Shop in this city, with accounting records to prove it. The rice hidden in Zhu's home has been retrieved and handed over to the Little Kunshan Public Security Sub-Station for safekeeping, pending handling by the county government. In addition, the meeting decided to transfer the case to the county for strict punishment to deter corruption. It is heard that the county government intends to impose a severe punishment to maintain discipline.</p>

<p>The Bandit Ships Left: The day before yesterday afternoon, a large number of bandit ships suddenly sailed into the Jiaodiao Bay area and anchored. The merchants in the town were alarmed and rushed to put up barricades, but were stopped by the bandits, who claimed they were there for fair trading and did not allow police assistance. The bandits on guard carried sharp weapons. After several hours, they cooked their meals, and then raised anchor and sailed away. It is heard that the temporary posting of guards in this city at 5 pm yesterday is also related to this incident.</p>

<p>Reorganization of Zhuangnan Chamber of Commerce Invalid: The recent reorganization of the Zhuanghang and Nanhui chambers of commerce was approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. However, the applicable regulations cited at that time treated the reorganization as a re-election, leading to fundamental errors in the procedure. The County Party Branch has raised objections, and in addition to suspending activities, it has been decided at a joint Party-government meeting to convene the old members of the two chambers of commerce together with the county government to reorganize them in a legal manner.</p>
<p>Sixth Sub-Bureau Captures Bandit Leader: The Chief of the Sixth Public Security Sub-Bureau, Chen Xue-zhu, according to reports, is aware that bandit leader Zhou Zixiang, who is related to robbery cases along the Huangpu-Fengnan border, has returned and is planning to cause trouble.

<p>Bu Te-wu's Wrongful Accusation Exonerated: In the recent case of a revolt by a small number of undesirable elements in the county police force, the county government considered the matter to be of great importance and has transferred the perpetrators to the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Headquarters for review. It was alleged that Bu You-chang, a special agent of the Second Detachment, was involved. However, his colleagues claimed that the allegation was based on the confessions of the arrested Zhou and Meng, who said that Bu was introduced by Squad Leader Mao, but he did not want to appear in person, so everything was handled by Mao. However, Mao claimed that if Bu was involved, why would he need to ask him to represent him? After repeated questioning, he consistently denied it. At the same time, judicial investigation found no other supporting evidence. It is heard that the Garrison Headquarters has sent him back to Fengxian to be placed under temporary custody by the police headquarters pending investigation. Now, the police officers of the team and local people, seeing Bu's correct conduct and his advanced age and declining energy, all vouch for his lack of any wrongdoing. They jointly submitted a petition to the authorities to guarantee his exoneration.</p>

<p>Anonymous Extortion: Tang Zhengzhi, a resident of Futang Bridge in the fifth district, recently received an anonymous threatening letter along with a bullet, demanding 3,000 yuan.

On the evening of the 5th, he sealed old paper as a money package and sent someone to place it in the graveyard specified by the bandit. At the same time, armed detectives sent by the Public Security Bureau ambushed in the nearby cotton field, waiting for the bandits from sunset until dawn, but saw no movement. The investigation has not yet yielded any clues.</p>
<p>Youth Robbed of Funds: Cheng Anzhi's son, Tongchen, 22 years old, a resident of Anting Town South Street, works as a clerk at Guangxiang Grocery Store in the French Concession of Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 11th, he intended to take the 4:30 Shanghai-Changzhou train home, carrying 112 yuan entrusted to him by his colleagues. When he arrived at the station, the train had already left. While waiting in the waiting room, a Mr. Jia, who seemed familiar, struck up a conversation with him, claiming that he had also gotten off the train at Anting and was feeling bored waiting. He suggested going out for a chat, speaking very earnestly. Tongchen, seeing that he was well-dressed, did not suspect anything and went with him to a restaurant not far from the station. They opened a bottle of wine and talked animatedly. After three cups, he suddenly felt dizzy and lost consciousness. On the morning of the 13th, he regained consciousness slightly and found himself lying on a couch in a room. Mr. Jia was nowhere to be found, and the funds were also missing. An old woman brought him a bowl of noodles. Realizing that he had been robbed, he left in disappointment and took a train back home. He was still extremely tired and his speech was still unclear.</p>
<p>Further News on the Murder Case at the Train Station: In the murder case that occurred at the Anting Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in this county, the county government has taken the station porter Lu Jinzhang into custody for interrogation. The station chief Zhou Dunchen was also implicated. County Magistrate Chen sent a letter to the Railway Administration and dispatched Zhu Shou, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, to facilitate interrogation. The reason the station chief was implicated was based on a prior report from the defense corps requesting the arrest of Qiao (A'er) and Zhou (Peirong). Since the complete arrest of the murderers has not been achieved and the ringleaders are still uncertain, the county government yesterday (the 15th) sought the original letter from the Eighth District Office to clarify the truth. District Chief Zhang has complied with the order and submitted it.</p>

<p>Construction Bureau Approves Demolition of Xuanmiao Temple Screen Wall: The demolition of the screen walls on both sides of the Xuanmiao Temple mountain gate has been a point of contention between conservationists and merchants in the area. It has now been learned that merchants such as Xu Xunru received a Construction Bureau order on the 16th, approving the demolition and issuing palace-style municipal blueprints for reconstruction. After receiving the order yesterday (the 17th), Xu Xunru and others paid a special visit to County Magistrate Huang and Construction Bureau Chief Wei, requesting the start of construction soon to facilitate the project. County Magistrate Huang and Construction Bureau Chief Wei stated that they had not yet received instructions from the Construction Bureau and the provincial government and could not execute the order hastily. Furthermore, the screen wall is temple property and must be demolished by workers hired by Abbot Yan Juecang of Xuanmiao Temple.</p>
<p>Investigation into the Case of False Accusation of Subversion: Lu Chengzhang, Wang Shuzhen, and others from the Tongsheng Paper Mill in Hengmian Town, Nanhui County, owed the shop dozens of yuan for paper and small materials. The shop owner, Wu Haisheng, demanded payment from Lu and Wang. Lu and Wang claimed that they had misrecorded the accounts, leading to a conflict. On the morning of August 12th, when Wu happened to be out of the shop, Shao Kang brought a subversive leaflet and threw it into Tongsheng shop, and then ran to report it to the eighth branch of the public security bureau in charge. The bureau ordered a police officer to go and search for the subversive material and then arrested Wu and interrogated him on suspicion of subversion and transferred him to the county government. After Wu was detained, dozens of shops in the area, including Lu Wansheng, jointly petitioned the county government for his release. The county magistrate, being unwilling to interfere, transferred the case to the county high court the other day. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhu opened the court for investigation.</p>
<p>Verdict in the Case of Stolen and Sold Kerosene: The Shanghai Texas Oil Company had 600 boxes of Happiness Kerosene stolen in July by boatman Wu Fuyuan, who took them to Suzhou, where Xu Dianyuan, Zhang Jiantang, and others stole and sold them for profit. After investigation by the Public Security Bureau's detective team and the Shui-gong'an third district detectives, Xu Dianyuan, Zhang Jiantang, Wu Fuyuan, and others were apprehended and sent to the Wu County Local Court. The verdict was reached the other day (the 15th). Wu Fuyuan, intending to illegally profit himself, was sentenced to eight months imprisonment and a fine of 100 yuan for jointly appropriating property held in the course of business. Xu Dianyuan and Zhang Jiantang, intending to illegally profit themselves, were sentenced to four months imprisonment and a fine of 100 yuan for jointly appropriating the property of others. Zhang Jiantang was fined an additional 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Committee Member Rewarding Wounded Soldiers Robbed: The evening before last (the 15th), two staff members of the 61st Division's Nanjing Office, Zhong Junxiu and Peng Jiu, arrived in Suzhou from Nanjing. They were carrying over 1,300 yuan in cash to be distributed as rewards to the wounded soldiers of the division at the Maple Bridge 15th Rear Hospital. As it was already late, they decided to distribute the money the next day. However, when they were walking through Phoenix, they were suddenly attacked by more than ten people wielding wooden sticks, who injured Zhong's head and snatched the black leather bag containing the 1,300 yuan in cash. Zhong reported the incident to the Public Security Third Branch, which immediately sent him to Suzhou People's Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning (the 17th), the leather bag was discovered in the Maple Bridge Hanshan Temple river, and a soldier-like corpse was floating in the river. The local security guard reported it to the local procuratorate, which sent Prosecutor Lü Yihou to inspect the scene. The examination revealed that the skin of the deceased was rotting. The bag contained 100 yuan of the stolen money, a passport of Zhong Junxiu of the 61st Division's Nanjing Office (located in the Liangguang Guild Hall in the capital), and a reward ordinance. The examination revealed that the deceased's skin was decayed. The bag contained two dice, thirty-one copper coins, and eleven small coins. There was also three tokens (1) Zhu Zhengjin, First Division, Second Brigade, First Regiment, Second Battalion, Seventh Company (2) Zhu Zhengjing, 15th Rear Hospital (3) The new token of the 15th Rear Hospital.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Causing Disturbances: Most residents of Kaiyuan Township in Wuxi County make a living by raising fish. Fish ponds line the area from Xianli Mound along Five Mile Lake to Rong Lane. Recently, groups of three to five wounded soldiers have been bringing equipment to fish in the ponds. The villagers rely on the fish for their livelihood throughout the year, and whenever wounded soldiers arrive, the women and children plead with them, but to little avail. Helpless, they appeal to the district chief, Shi Tang, who forwards the complaint to the county government, but to no avail. Yesterday morning (the 17th), more wounded soldiers arrived in the township to fish, but this time the number swelled to over a hundred. The villagers tried to dissuade them to no effect, and a conflict almost broke out. They reported it to the ninth branch of the public security bureau, which in turn reported it to the county government, the public security bureau, and the military police corps, which sent military police to suppress the situation. The wounded soldiers demanded rewards. After repeated persuasion, a resolution was finally reached. The other day, eight representatives of the wounded soldiers went to the county chamber of commerce to demand rewards. County Magistrate Pan and Public Security Bureau Chief Xu attended the meeting and persuaded them for two hours, finally promising to give them a satisfactory answer within three days. They then dispersed. The county government has telegraphed the provincial civil affairs department to request instructions.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Suddenly Arrive in Shitouwan: Yesterday morning, about 300 Jiangbei refugees of all ages, both male and female, suddenly arrived at Shitouwan Town in the 16th District (Wan'anshi). They arrived in several civilian boats and went ashore to demand food from shops and residents. The town's commercial corps, seeing the situation, feared something might happen and immediately came out to maintain order and provide food. The refugees spent the night in the town, and the next day, the commercial corps escorted them towards Wujin.</p>
<p>Old Woman Dies Suddenly at Chong'an Temple: Yesterday, an old woman of about fifty years of age, from the countryside, was walking through Chong'an Temple in the city when she suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness. She died shortly after. The local ward head reported it to the county government, which sent an inspector to the scene. The inspection revealed that she had died of illness. The ward head was ordered to prepare a coffin and bury her in a temporary altar, so that her family could claim the body.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>The Case of Gu's Arrest is False: News of the much-circulated arrest of Gu has spread as if it were true. According to Gu's neighbors, the case is entirely false. It is true that a gunboat went to Zou's, and a suspicious Mr. Jia was arrested on the opposite bank, but he was soon released after interrogation. Do-gooders then exaggerated and spread rumors, leading to this unfounded rumor.</p>

The provincial security corps is currently coordinating with the warships Bo Xian and Jun He, as well as the water patrol team, to suppress them. The provincial government has telegraphed the Haimen County Government to build a motor road and install military telephones in the shortest possible time to facilitate the defense and suppression efforts of the military and police.</p>

<p>Bandits Attempted Robbery at Lotus Bridge: Last night (the 15th) at 10:00 PM, four bandits suddenly pushed open the door and entered the home of Tan Yinglou, resident of No. 7 Lotus Bridge. Intending to commit robbery, they were discovered by Officer Yang of the First Public Security Sub-Station, who immediately led police officers to encircle and arrest them. Nearby merchants also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Seeing the situation, the bandits fled in a panic. It is reported that the family only lost two pieces of silver jewelry.</p>
<p>Assault Caused by Jealousy, Request for Inspection: The landlady of a certain clothing store in Daru Fang had been having an affair with her neighbor Xu Baoshan for some time. The landlady recently had a relationship with Bi Songfa, inside Tianyi Pool Bathhouse on this street. When Xu found out, the two fought with each other. After mediation, nothing happened, but Xu Baoshan was still not willing to give up. Yesterday (the 15th) afternoon at 5:00 PM, taking advantage of Bi's absence, he used an iron bar to hit him in the head, causing a large wound. The two then fought to the courthouse, where a prosecutor inspected the wounds and took Xu into custody. He was also immediately sent to the Popular Salvation Hospital in Gengzi Street for treatment. According to the doctor, his brain was severely injured, and it is impossible to say whether he is in danger.</p>

<p>Cixi Public Security Bureau Apprehends Many Bandits: Seeing that robbery cases have been occurring frequently, the Cixi County Public Security Bureau dispatched police detectives to conduct strict inspections of travelers at various inns in the city on the 13th and 14th of this month. As a result, they apprehended robbers Ying A'san, A'er, A'jiao, Zhou Xiaomei, Wang A'er, and other seven bandits related to the robbery of Cai Jiaqiao, Hongjia, Su Feng, and other places at Xiangxing Inn in Lower Heng Street. The haul included thirty to forty pawn tickets, a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, a watch, and two bundles of women's clothing.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Meixiang's Home Robbed: Xuan Meixiang, a wealthy household in Dingzhai Street, Southern Township, was once kidnapped by bandits in the autumn of the year before last and redeemed for 3,000 yuan. Xuan then closed her doors to guests and lived in seclusion. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM the other night, more than ten bandits with a foreign accent arrived again at her home. They ransacked the place for over an hour and stole a lot of red and soft clothing, causing losses of about five or six hundred gold.</p>
<p>Bandit Gang's Attempted Kidnapping Fails: Shen Lanxiu, a farmer from Lihai, Western Township, had a daughter married to a wealthy Zhang family in Yuyao. Recently, due to unrest in the countryside of the county, Shen brought her son and his mother to her home for temporary refuge. Unexpectedly, the bandit gang discovered this and gathered eight or nine people with flashlights and pistols at midnight the other day to knock on Shen's door. They falsely claimed that her father-in-law was seriously ill and they were ordered to pick up his mother and son. Shen, suspecting something was wrong in the middle of the night, did not open the door at first. Peeking through the crack in the door, she recognized them as bandits. Shen's mother quickly hid her grandson in the cotton industry outside the back door. The bandit gang broke down the door, forced their way in, and searched wantonly without success, before leaving in disappointment.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Lawyer Zhou Jia of Jiaxing's Letter</h3>
<p>To the respected editor, after reading the article titled "Problems with the Succession of the Lu Family of Pinghu" in the Local Correspondence section of your newspaper on September 13 of this year, it is quite inconsistent with the facts. My aunt Lu Zhou passed away with a will that bequeathed her property to her daughter Lu Yulin. The will was used as evidence. On the 11th of this month, Lu Zhou was buried and then Lu Lanbo colluded with Lu Chengqing to forcefully inherit, in an attempt to seize property. My lawyer acted in good faith and Lu Lanbo was at a loss for words. I present the actual situation at the time. Inheritance is a mandatory regulation and does not allow the parties to change it with their will. So can it be forcefully continued if the goal is to seize the property? A lawsuit has been filed and should wait for the legal solution. There is no need to defend ourselves. We are afraid of rumors and hereby write to request that your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section for clarity. Zhou Jia, Lawyer, September 16</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders Primary Schools</p>
<h3>To Perform No More Than Twice a Year</h3>
<p>And orders publishing houses to add the New System of Measurement to Arithmetic textbooks</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 17th: The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all publishing houses that future arithmetic textbooks should adopt the new system of weights and measures. Published textbooks should be supplemented with loose-leaf teaching materials for remediation. Furthermore, in light of the prevalent practice of primary schools performing song and dance dramas, which interferes with regular classes, the Ministry issued a special circular restricting each school to no more than two performances per year.</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee, based on the suggestions of the Special Party Branches of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, has approved the Ministry of Education to review the issue of songs, dances, and dramas taught in primary and secondary schools being suitable for physical education without interfering with regular classes.</p>
<h3>Education Ministry Order for the Adoption of Reviewed Books</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has issued an order stating that all books reviewed and approved by the Ministry may be freely adopted. Local educational administrative organs may not make separate selections or request the adoption of books based on submissions from publishing houses. Special instructions have been issued to the educational departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities. Upon investigation, it has been found that the review of educational textbooks should be handled uniformly by the Ministry. Previous orders from the former University Council and the Ministry have been issued and recorded. Recently, it has been found that some local educational administrative organs are still independently selecting textbooks and ordering schools to adopt them, which clearly contradicts previous orders. Furthermore, some are hastily ordering schools to adopt books based solely on eloquent submissions from publishing houses, even including books that have not been reviewed, without making any distinctions. Such violations of the order are highly inappropriate. The Ministry hereby reiterates its intentions regarding the review of educational textbooks as follows: All educational textbooks reviewed and approved by the Ministry and the former University Council, as well as those permitted for publication, have been successively published in the Ministry's and the former University Council's official gazettes. Educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities should pay attention to copying and distributing these to all schools so that the schools can freely adopt them. They must not organize review committees or the like to make selections. Schools must not be ordered to adopt specific books. If any publishing houses submit requests for the adoption of certain educational textbooks, these should be strictly rejected and not used as a basis for issuing orders, in order to prevent encroachment and the creation of malpractices. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance by the relevant departments.</p>

<p>Cai Yuanpei's Visit to Wuxi Scheduled: For the first day of the Society's annual meeting, Cai Yuanpei, Dai Jitao, and Shao Yuanchong were originally invited to give keynote speeches. However, due to Mr. Cai's trip to Qingdao, it was feared that he would not be able to arrive in Wuxi in time. Therefore, the scheduled speaking time was allocated to Mr. Dai and Mr. Shao, who were asked to speak for an additional 15 to 30 minutes each. Now, the Society has received a telegram from Mr. Cai in Qingdao confirming that he will depart on the 19th and arrive in Wuxi on the 22nd. At that time, Mr. Cai will be invited to speak during the meeting. In addition, Shanghai industrial magnate Liu Hongsheng will also attend and speak.</p>

<p>Reception by Educational Organizations: The Jiangsu Provincial Wuxi Education Institute, the Provincial Xizhong Elementary School, the Education Bureau, the Education Association, the County Girls' Middle School, the Junior Middle School, the Private Xizhong School, the Furen Middle School, and the National Studies College, recognizing the great contributions of the Society's members to the improvement of China's economy, and in order to enhance academic exchange and emotional connection, jointly designated representatives from the above organizations to hold a welcome reception at the Provincial Xizhong School.

<h3>Recent Situation of West China Union University</h3>
<p>West China Union University, a church university located outside the South Gate of Chengdu, Sichuan, was established by five church groups: the American Methodist Episcopal Church, the English Methodist Church, the Friends Church, the Baptist Church, and the Anglican Church. The entire campus covers approximately 1,000 acres and includes specialized classrooms and a library for the faculties of arts, sciences, medicine, dentistry, and education. The various buildings are exceptionally magnificent and adopt a Chinese palace style, similar to the campus of Yenching University in the East. Founded 20 years ago, it is located in a remote area, so it is less well-known. More than 200 students have graduated. Medical and dental students have made significant contributions to the three southwestern provinces. Each church has its own athletic field, and all five churches share a common athletic field. Students practice diligently on weekdays, so physical education is well-developed, and the university often holds the leading position in the province's sports circles. The principal, Dr. Beech, an American, founded the university single-handedly and endured many hardships. Recently, due to fundraising matters, he returned to the United States. Principal Zhang Linggao is handling affairs effectively and is currently working hard on the registration issue. There are currently more than 500 students, including 50 female students. The school atmosphere is quite pure and rarely interferes with external affairs. Therefore, despite the years of war in Sichuan Province, the school's academic activities have continued uninterrupted. Recently, the school's affairs have been developing increasingly well, so it has attracted a lot of jealousy. Dr. Su Zhepu, a professor at the school, was assassinated on campus. As a precautionary measure, the school built a short wall to enclose it, in order to prevent idlers. However, some people misunderstood this as the school building a fortress for self-defense, which was considered unreasonable, and led a large group of people to demolish the short wall. However, according to the school, the construction of the wall had been approved by the Chengdu authorities.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Education Association Prepares for Re-election</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Association held its tenth executive committee meeting on the 14th of this month at Beiqiao Elementary School, chaired by Zhang Jingye. The most important resolutions included scheduling the re-election meeting for all county members at Tangwan Elementary School at 10:00 AM on September 28th, and sending letters to the County Government, the County Party Headquarters, and the County Education Bureau to send representatives for guidance. In recent days, the executive committee members have been settling accounts and compiling the association's work report for distribution to all members at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Liangjiang School After Completion of New School Building</h3>
<p>The new school building of the Liangjiang Girls' Physical Education School in this city, located on Daji Road, was completed earlier and opened on September 1st, with formal classes starting on the 8th. There are over 300 new and old students. Because this exceeded the projected student enrollment, the new school building was not sufficient for all the programs, and some students were still studying in the old school building on Fangxie Road. Now, three new buildings are being constructed to house a library, the Liangjiang Cooperative, and a storage room. The vacant space behind the school building is the planned location for a gymnasium and ball fields. The architectural drawings for the gymnasium have already been finalized and construction will begin soon. Each classroom will accommodate a maximum of 40 students, so each grade will have two classes. Principal Lu Lihua, recognizing the lack of well-built swimming pools built by Chinese people, which makes swimming a rarity, considers this a major deficiency for a physical education school. He also plans to build a swimming pool in the near future. Mr. Lu believes that the school's current facilities are only part of the ideal and that gradual progress will continue until perfection is achieved.</p>

<p>Qiu Lin's Ambitions</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai to Go to Europe at the End of This Month, Lin Baohua to Go to America Next Spring</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai participated in various tennis championships in Shanghai this summer, earning a stellar reputation. His participation in the lawn tennis club's singles competition is sure to earn him a championship ticket. Mr. Qiu's trip to Europe has attracted much attention from all walks of life. It is recently learned that Mr. Qiu will leave at the end of this month, first going to Singapore for a few weeks before going to Europe. The cost of travel is rumored to be funded by a wealthy businessman, Mr. Chen, of this city.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua, who won various singles championships in Shanghai last year, will only participate in various doubles competitions this year, and perhaps not participate in the singles championships, as he does not want to monopolize the awards and wants to give others a chance. Mr. Lin is young and strong and an all-around tennis player. If he can further his studies, his future is limitless. Mr. Lin does not dare to be complacent and, recognizing the lack of well-known players in the country for him to learn and explore with, intends to go abroad to practice with the help of Mr. Ye. He will go to America next spring. America is the home of many of the world's best tennis players and offers many opportunities for in-depth study.</p>
<p>China vs. England This Saturday</p>
<h3>Robber Cup Final</h3>
<p>The China-England international Robber Cup doubles tournament has been decided, with both countries winning the right to compete in the final after defeating the United States last week. The game is scheduled for Saturday afternoon at the French Chamber of Commerce. China has the strong duo of Lin and Qiu, while England has Whittaker and Stokes. Judging by their strength, England should not be an enemy of China, and the championship will surely be won by China.</p>
<h3>Lawn Tennis Club Men's Singles Tournament</h3>
<p>Four Out of Eight Participants are Chinese</p>
<p>Only eight people participated in the Lawn Tennis Club Men's Open Singles Tournament, but Chinese players accounted for half of them, including Qiu Feihai, Jiang Daozhang, Yu Tianguang, and Liu Keng. Zheng Zhaojia has not yet recovered from his foot injury and was unable to participate. Lin Baohua, last year's champion, has temporarily retired to give others a chance, which is also a kind intention. The competition will begin soon.</p>
<p>Chinese</p>
<h3>It is Said the Expedition Football Team Has Returned Home</h3>
<p>Heard that they have already left Singapore to return north.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for stopping the trip to Europe.</p>
<p>丨An Explanation for Non-Cooperation with South China丨</p>
<p>The Chinese expedition football team organized by Lehua originally planned to sweep through Southeast Asia and then explore Europe. However, it has recently been rumored that they have returned to the country from Singapore and are already on their way. The Lehua team only had nine basic members. In addition, they invited players from the South China and China teams of Hong Kong to join them to strengthen their team. However, the South China and China sides suddenly went back on their previous agreement and did not cooperate, making things very difficult for Lehua. Moreover, Lehua is a member of the Westerners' Football Club of Shanghai, and the club's charter states that any member wishing to compete in another location must obtain the club's permission. Lehua did not notify the Westerners' Club of this trip abroad, and the Westerners' Club did not give its approval, so the expedition team's trip to Europe was hindered.</p>
<h3>South China Team's Explanation</h3>
<p>(Singapore Correspondence, August 25th) The fact that the South China players did not join the Chinese expedition football team is worthy of attention from the Chinese sports community. Therefore, the reporter has made many inquiries to inform the people of the country. Last time, there was a conversation from the deputy leader of South China, Mr. Yu Juyan, which was sent to Shanghai in detail, explaining the three reasons for South China's non-participation in the expedition: improper procedures, no economic security, and occupational relations. Readers should still remember this. Therefore, when the expedition team returned to Singapore, the reporter went to the South Sky Hotel where the team was staying to interview Mr. Yu Hengzhi. However, Mr. Yu's intention was that this was a matter of the past and he did not want to say more. At the reporter's insistence, he said that the team was responsible for the expenses of the players. Any player who wanted to return home halfway through the trip could have their deposit refunded. The reason for returning home was not a lack of funds. It was not a question of team members not having enough money to return home. The phrase "occupational suspicion" is even less of a problem. The reporter then asked Mr. Yu Hengzhi, "They borrowed players from South China to join the expedition, but the South China team said that the procedures were not in order. What exactly does that mean?" Mr. Yu said that the expedition team had obtained the consent of Ye Beihua, Li Tiansheng, and Feng Jingxiang in advance, and also sent a letter to the South China Sports Association afterwards. The reporter then asked if he had received a reply. Mr. Yu said that he had not received a reply to this day. As the reporter was about to ask other questions, Guan Jianan, the military doctor accompanying the team, said loudly, "Sir, do you think the Hong Kong players are absolutely brilliant and the Shanghai players are all fools?" The reporter did not ask any more questions and resigned.</p>
<p>However, this simple news could not complete the reporter's draft, so the next morning I visited the team members for a casual chat. Inadvertently, I learned that the South China team members (i.e., the personal opinions of the three gentlemen Ye, Feng, and Li) confirmed that they had agreed to go to Europe before, and even received clothing fees. The reason why Li, Ye, and Feng were unable to go may have been due to the obstruction of the Nanyang Association. The disagreement of opinions in the Chinese sports community is worthy of our research.</p>
<p>Also, when the China team arrived in Singapore the day before yesterday, Chen Guangyao, a member of the expedition team (his home team is the China team), also went to welcome them. The reporter happened to be in the same car with him, so I had a brief conversation with him. I asked Mr. Chen why he and Cao Guicheng were the only ones willing to join the expedition team (because Mr. Chen and Cao were originally one pair in the China team). Mr. Chen said that we should be broad-minded in our work and should not eliminate our personal ambitions because of the relationship with one association. By joining the European trip, I really want to learn more about the world and visit the world, which is a fortunate event in life. The reporter then asked if the expedition team provided any subsidies to the team members on this trip. Mr. Chen said that in addition to travel expenses, we did not receive any money from the team and there were no so-called subsidies, so people should not suspect that we are staff members. You must know that we can participate whenever we want and return whenever we want. We have absolute freedom.</p>
<p>Also, this time when the expedition team returned to Singapore, they did not stay at Hu Wenhu's villa in Banksba Rang because the China team had arrived and it was inconvenient for the two teams to live together, so they stayed on the third floor of the South Sky Hotel, one of the leading Chinese hotels.</p>
<p>There was no special action by the team members that could be reported to the readers, because the weather in Singapore was too hot, so the team members spent most of the day writing letters and working in the hotel, while Zhou Xianyan and Chen Yutian spent the whole day sorting out their photo albums to pass the summer. In the evenings, the team members would go out in groups of two or three to stroll the streets. They didn't have much social contact with the outside world, as the expedition team was no longer new to the area (foreigners now call newly arrived overseas Chinese "new customers").</p>
<p>The team members' meals consist of a breakfast of their choice, with some eating fish porridge or chicken porridge, and others eating noodles. Lunch is served in the hotel, but dinner is eaten at the food stalls under Pearl Hill. This is the only place where Cantonese people sell food. It only opens in the afternoon, and all kinds of roasted pork, sliced boiled chicken, roast duck, and barbecued pork are especially good there. It is economical and delicious, so the expedition team flocks to it. The night before going to Kuala Lumpur, they opened two tables with a total cost of just over five yuan, but the side dishes filled the table. It was a different flavor from what they enjoyed at Hu Wenhu's villa and it was very interesting.</p>
<h3>News from the China Football Association</h3>

<p>The match between Japan and Lianglu was postponed because the Japanese team did not understand the Chinese announcement clearly, so the team did not arrive until 9:00 pm. The organizers decided to postpone the match out of consideration for the situation. Then, since they had already come, they decided to add to the interest by having a friendly competition with Feima. As a result, Feima won by five to two.</p>
<p>Brief Review of Skills: In the battle between Jingyi and Qingxing, Jingyi is mostly organized by Japanese Yuyusen colleagues. Fang Keqing, Keqiang, Ruan Yaohui, etc. are all veterans. Their defensive and offensive skills are strong. In this year's Champagne Cup, they have a good chance of winning third or fourth place. Qingxing is organized by members of the YMCA. Although Luo Zairen, Zhang Decai, and others practice day and night, they have not been established for long and lack competition experience. Therefore, their skills are much worse in the competition than in practice. If they can work hard, they will have great hope in the future. Feima, after failing at gauze the other day, discussed their hitting methods in depth. Sure enough, when they fought the Citibank ping pong team last night, each player showed great skill and won by seven to zero.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Doctor to a sick rich woman: Listen to me, this bottle of medicine must be taken every two hours, one teaspoon each time is enough.</p>
<p>Rich woman: Sir, don't be too economical with me. As long as I get better, spending more money doesn't matter. I want to take it once an hour, one bottle each time. What do you think?</p>
<p>A: Old Bing asked to borrow fifty yuan from me. Do you think he's reliable?</p>
<p>B: As long as he has collateral, you might as well lend it to him.</p>
<p>A: Do you know what collateral he has that I can ask him for?</p>
<p>B: A pair of pants and a rope.</p>
<p>Husband: Oh dear! What should I do? What should I do?</p>
<p>Wife: What's the matter, why are you making such a fuss?</p>
<p>Husband: There's a huge rat in the rice bucket!</p>
<p>Wife: That doesn't matter. Lock it inside and let it starve to death.</p>
<p>Teacher: Children, do you know how the net for playing ping pong is made?</p>

<p>Old gentleman: Child, what do you plan to do when you grow up?</p>
<p>Child: I plan to have a son and call him by my father's name so I can beat him up every day.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Autumn Lamp</h3>
<p>— Li Shuping</p>
<p>A few boring tales picked up on an autumn night, recorded urgently for the reference of biologists.</p>
<p>Birds change their habitats due to climate change, often wintering in the tropics and summering in cold regions. In Europe, there is a bird called the "Western Mud Nest" that is produced in Denmark. No one has ever paid attention to its whereabouts when it comes and goes in spring and autumn. Recently, a biologist, wanting to explore how far it migrates, caught countless birds and tied iron rings to their feet before releasing them. Unexpectedly, when winter came, all the ringed birds were found in Sicily and the southernmost part of Africa, a distance of 240,000 kilometers from their hometown. It is the bird that migrates farthest.</p>
<p>The island of Bogoroth is full of volcanoes. Since the explosion, there have been few people there. Recently, a soldier and explorer passed through the area and climbed to the mouth of a volcano to investigate. Suddenly, he found millions of bird eggs in the cave. At first, he was extremely surprised, but upon entering the cave, he felt a warm temperature. Only then did he realize that seabirds were using natural heat to incubate their eggs, which would surely accelerate the process.</p>
<p>Although rats are violent, they are good at knowing the situation. When we design traps to catch them, if a rat falls for the trick, all the rats will flee and dare not approach again. Even more extreme is the fact that there are more rats than people in Aslo, Europe. According to a survey, there are already 6 million rats. They steal and bite, and there is no peace at night for the residents. Recently, a chemical company manufactured 15,000 tons of poisoned bait and planned to pour it all over the city to kill them all. Unexpectedly, two days before the bait was laid, the rats gathered in groups of hundreds and thousands and fled, as if a great disaster was about to befall them. This is also strange.</p>
<p>A hunter in the forests of California recently captured a monster. It looked like a fox with two bat-like wings. It was 40 centimeters long, and its wingspan was one meter. Biologists cannot name it and are currently studying it.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Chess Competitions</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>For the sake of promoting legitimate entertainment, the Dongtai County People's Education Center held a chess competition this autumn. For a time, 33 people signed up, most of them well-known people, so that there were hundreds of spectators for each game. After three days of fierce battles, Hu Tianmin finally won. The scene of the competition was quite amusing. Recorded here to elicit a smile.</p>
<p>Spectators Form a Screen: The center set up six matches for the preliminary round in the auditorium at 2:00 pm on September 9. Dozens of spectators surrounded each match, forming six natural meat screens. There were even more spectators on the second day of the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Disorderly and Noisy, Spectators Take Over: During the match, spectators would whisper and discuss every move. Then, they would speak and gesture loudly, and the referee had to stop them.</p>
<p>Millions of Sighs and Long Exhalations: There were even more spectators on the third afternoon of the competition. The center drew a large chessboard on the wall of the stage. Lu Xu and Hu Tianmin, who won the right to compete in the finals, played against each other. Every time a piece was moved behind the stage, it was copied on the stage. If they were winning, they would praise each other. If they made a mistake, there would be sighs and exclamations. Although the noise was not very loud, there were no less than three or four hundred spectators in front of the stage, which was almost like a boiling pot. Because they were far from the stage, it did not disturb the players' clear thinking.</p>
<h3>Miss He Xiangning's Secretary</h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>Former Central Committee member He Xiangning has long been an important figure in the women's community for her dedication to party and national affairs as a woman. She has sponsored women's movements extensively, hoping to raise women's rights, and has also vigorously promoted women's employment to seek a path for women. Ms. He is skilled in calligraphy and painting, and since leaving Beijing the year before last, she has devoted herself to writing. She has published a collection of her paintings and distributed it to various comrades. Ms. He has a wide circle of friends, and she often engages in correspondence. She especially enjoys writing in her spare time, and she is quite busy with her writing and calligraphy. Therefore, she has hired a female secretary to assist her with everything. I met her at a friend's place yesterday and learned that the female secretary's name is Jin Peiyao, the younger sister of Jin Yanwen, an important figure in the Guangdong naval community. She is a very capable person with excellent literary skills. She has served as a staff member of the Guangzhou Finance Department and the Central Party Headquarters, so she is well-known in political circles as a rare talent in the women's community. It is no small thing for Ms. He's office to have her assistance.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the Weile Garden</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The Weile Garden opened at 9 p.m. on the 13th. More than 500 Chinese and foreign guests attended the event, and no less than six to seven thousand people from all walks of life came to watch the races. The seats around the perimeter were almost all occupied. The garden owner hosted a grand banquet to entertain the distinguished guests and leaders of the sports community, who were dressed in formal attire and chatting happily. The McInnes military band also came to perform, adding to the elegant atmosphere. After the meal, the competition began with ten events. At that time, the electric lights illuminated the scene as if it were daytime. There were wireless reports of the news in the arena. Seventy-odd jockeys from Chinese, Japanese, and Annamese teams each carried their bicycles and circled the track once, and then competed in order. The result was that the Chinese team won the championship. The speed of the bicycle on the inclined track was extremely fast, traveling at 300 miles per hour, comparable to the speed of an airplane. However, if one is not careful, falling from such a height can easily lead to danger. There was also a motorcycle contest, which was even faster. Flying around the track was dazzling and astonishing.</p>
<p>The garden is located to the left of Haig Road, covering an area of twenty acres. The entrance is a tunnel, and further in is a plaza. In the center is a dance floor, and on both sides are special seats that can accommodate 400 people, furnished with tables and chairs for guests to dine. Around the perimeter is a wooden track shaped like a sycee, about one mile in circumference and two zhang in width. The steepest part forms a 45-degree acute angle, which is quite smooth. Outside the field are four high platforms, each of which can accommodate a thousand people. The entire building is exquisitely grand and was designed by the French architect Taifaner and completed in more than half a year.</p>
<p>According to Weile Garden staff, there are currently more than 300 members, five of whom are of Chinese nationality, and the others are Japanese, Russian, Annamese, and Korean. There are more than 100 people who have received competitive training, and 57 of them are qualified to compete. In addition to bicycle and motorcycle races, the scheduled performance types also include Jai Alai, Chinese boxing, handball, and dancing, but bicycle races are its main purpose. Famous bicycle manufacturers from the United States, France, and Austria use this to promote the sturdiness and durability of their bicycles and expand their sales. Therefore, merchants in Shanghai who operate this business are more enthusiastic about bicycle races. It can be said that foreigners' efforts to compete in trade with China are profound and far-reaching.</p>
<h3>Ramblings on Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Meilang</p>
<p>Peking Opera is named because the old capital was its place of origin, hence the name "Jing" (Peking) opera. However, since the political reforms and the relocation of the national capital to the south, this name has been abolished. It would be more appropriate to change the name to "Ping" (Beijing) opera, following the example of renaming Beiping. However, that sounds too awkward and does not flow well. As for calling it "national opera," there are many types of opera in our country, so using this one term to encompass all the others seems somewhat inaccurate.</p>
<p>Chen Delin, the leading figure of Qingyi (female role) acting, has recently passed away. Wang Yaoqing alone remains, like a surviving spiritual light of the Lu Temple. In the old days, his ingenious and unique creation of new vocal styles brought about a great change in the style of female roles. The Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang generations followed suit and further developed it. As times changed, it became a global craze. Those with a Zhou Yu-like appreciation immediately felt refreshed, and ancient beauties such as the weeping Qing in "Burying Flowers" and the Hongfu in "The Runaway Bride" have since become ubiquitous on singing and dancing stages.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai opera scene has mostly called upon consecutive stage plays. Although their novel costumes and magical stage settings are not favored by those who appreciate the nuances of music, their emphasis on showing off and creating novelty is enough to attract the attention of the contemporary public. These people have no choice but to do so for the sake of business, so it is not too critical.</p>
<p>However, there are still quite a few members of the community who are passionate about this art form and meticulously adhere to the models of the past. Perhaps this is an example of seeking what is lost in the countryside. Taking a corner of the city as an example, the number of amateur opera troupes is like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The rising star, the Mingxing Opera Troupe, has been gaining increasing renown since its two rehearsals. It was previously reported that they were seeking sponsoring members, and in less than two months, they raised a huge sum of 6,000 gold. The community's expectations for the troupe and their strong interest in Peking Opera can be seen from this. It is also heard that the troupe's third rehearsal will be held soon, with completely new costumes recently purchased. This is another example of perseverance in the amateur community. We should look forward to witnessing the performances of famous operas and satisfying our eyes.</p>
<h3>New Knowledge for the Family</h3>
<p>— Tianshu Wosheng (Compiled)</p>
<p>Pure honey essence should only use refined glycerin (Glyceine) that has been distilled through bone charcoal to remove sacrificial substances such as sulfuric acid. It is best not to add any impurities. However, the common problem of manufacturers is always to cut corners to reduce costs, either by adding some water or mixing in some syrup. Its effect is also changed. Because the purpose of applying glycerin on the skin is to absorb moisture from the air to moisturize the skin. Now that water has been added to it, what will it absorb? Moreover, glycerin applied on the skin can remove the brown pigment in the skin caused by sunlight and make the skin white and tender, and prevent wrinkles. If syrup is used to replace it, what use is it? Therefore, people who are generally discerning must buy foreign goods to use. In fact, the pure honey essence of the Invincible brand is as good as foreign honey. Just try to compare it: (1) Turn the glass bottle sideways to see how fast the bubbles inside move. (2) Dip a piece of paper in it and burn it to see what happens. (3) Apply it to the palm of your hand to see if it is oily. These three methods are the simplest. If water has been added, the bubbles will move very quickly and disappear in the blink of an eye. If syrup is mixed in, it will turn into charcoal when burned. If syrup and water are applied to the palm of the hand, it will only be sticky and not oily. Applying powder will turn it into a pile that cannot be smeared evenly. That is a disfiguring product, not a beauty product. We should be aware of this. (Lord of Kan Yun Lou)</p>
<p>(Attached note) Invincible brand pure honey essence is available in all department stores. The label clearly states "Invincible Brand Pure Honey Essence." The large bottle (6 taels) is priced at 60 cents, the medium bottle (4 taels) is priced at 45 cents, and the small bottle (2 taels) is priced at 30 cents. There is also an 8-tael bottle of the highest-quality honey essence, priced at one yuan per bottle. For mail orders of half a dozen or more, no additional postage will be charged.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Southeast Asia (52)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, I took a public bus to the zoo, which was founded by the monk Fakong of the Kek Lok Si Temple. The admission ticket was 40 cents, but I was given a free pass. Inside, there were African crowned cranes, guinea fowl, Indian Peng birds, and a Malayan earthworm that was two feet in diameter and one and a half feet wide, with long hair like clothes, which was quite a spectacle. The African ghost king monkey was given a banana, but it bared its teeth and snarled at people, both frightening and disgusting. The white-bearded monkey and the long-tailed monkey were very tame. Although they are all monkeys, their nature is not equally good or bad. The white-bearded monkey has a beard under its chin, and its tail is longer than its body. Its fur is five-colored. The white monkey and the five-colored monkey each cost over a thousand yuan, which is very expensive. They are not very big. They are all monkeys, but it is expensive. I do not understand such inequality. The Indian black lion monkey is quite elegant. There are also white-eyed and white-mouthed monkeys, with white circles around their eyes and mouths, like clowns in a play. All of them are tame. There are also yellow-eared and yellow-mouthed monkeys. There are over a hundred species of monkeys, with varying degrees of ferocity and tameness, differences in size, and variations in fur color. Some bare their teeth at each other when given food, some are greedy and dissatisfied, and some are content with little. I was moved by the differences in the nature of the monkey species and sighed at the extreme inequality in human nature, physiology, psychology, strength, weakness, good, evil, tameness, violence, male, and female. Is it not contrary to reality to treat people as uniformly equal? If monkeys cannot be equal, how can people be equal? I would like scholars of anthropology and sociology to answer this question. Chu Bawang was born with a stuttering voice, and Yan Ying was born less than seven feet tall. Emperor Wen of Han was kind and amiable, while Dou Yuejiao of Chu was born with the appearance of a bear and the voice of a jackal. How can those who are born bad and harm society be equal? Therefore, Confucius said, "Only the wise and the foolish do not change." I see the inequality among monkeys and sigh at the fact that the theory of human equality is not in line with reality. It is said that Rousseau advocated equality in the 18th century, while his friend Voltaire opposed it. Voltaire (1654-1778) Rousseau believed in popular revolution, while Voltaire ridiculed it, saying that if equality wins, freedom is lost. Voltaire and Rousseau were both key figures in promoting the French Revolution, but they differed fundamentally. The socialist Saint-Simon also opposed the idea of equality. Saint Simon. Even Marx, whom Russia believes in, did not believe in equality. Therefore, Lenin openly used an autocratic system of execution. A friend of the philosopher De Witts said that numbers cannot produce wisdom, and the masses are difficult to reason with. Socrates was killed in Athens because of the inequality of the parliament, and he was very saddened by human opinion. Jesus was crucified in Judea because it was decided by the Pharisees. Alas, I see the inequality in monkey society and am very saddened by the difficulty of aligning mankind. In the past, Ban Gu's Table of People divided people into nine grades, while Mr. Sun Yat-sen divided people into eight grades, with distinctions between the wise, talented, mediocre, and foolish, as well as the equality of flat heads and the equality of flat feet. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong revolutionary goal was to seek freedom and equality for mankind, and that was how he explained equality. Then, can people not deeply consider the meaning of equality and act blindly?</p>
<p>A pair of large white swans are extremely beautiful in the White Tao River. This is the bird praised in Kropotkin's theory of mutual aid, which has a highly moral group nature and can feed blind birds in its group. Confucius's Great Harmony first emphasized supporting the elderly, but now the elderly are despised. Are we really inferior to these swan birds?</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (279)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Sheds Tears, the Beauty's Heart is Broken; Red Lotus Loses Its Fragrance, a Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Cuiyun thought that her body had been sold. Unless she could pay back his money, but in the current situation, she could not pay back the money. What other options were there to consider? The only option was to endure. She hoped that Zhang Yiqing would treat her well and just get by, considering it a settled marriage. There was no talk of love, but compared to drifting outside, it was better. In these three months, it could be said that she had temporarily maintained the status quo. Because the other woman did not know about this small family. He went to Hankou by boat once a day, always for ten days. During these ten days, he spent all his time with Cuiyun. The woman at home was easily deceived because the elderly people at his old home would only get up when the sun was setting. However, calculating from a month, the other woman still got two-thirds of his time, while Cuiyun only got one-third. But this situation could not last forever, like lotus leaves wrapping water chestnuts, it could not be wrapped forever. As time went on, the secret would gradually leak out. One day, a steward on the Yangtze River steamer did not know their secret because that steward was recommended by this wife. Recently, he had been doing very well, just by bringing local products, he could earn dozens of dollars every month. So he specially bought some bronzeware in Hankou and some porcelain in Jiujiang to show his respect to the recommending benefactor. Without knowing it, he caused a problem. The steward's name was A Tu, born with some simple-mindedness. He knew that this wife got up late. In the evening, he presented what he had to offer like a Persian offering treasures. In addition to receiving his gifts, the wife casually asked what time your ship arrived today. A Tu said that the ship arrived the day before yesterday in the morning. Because there was something to do yesterday, I brought a little something today to visit the lady. The wife thought that the ship had already arrived the day before yesterday, so why didn't Yiqing come home yesterday? This matter was a little suspicious. She asked the comprador if he had seen him on the ship. A Tu said no, if the comprador was on the ship, we would definitely know. For example, when it was time to eat, we would eat with the second and third compradors. The wife said that he did not say that he took your ship to go and take your ship to come back? If A Tu was a little smarter, he would have known that they had other affairs. But this steward was a friend who [only bought bricks and not tiles] and insisted that the comprador was not on the ship. Not only was the comprador not on the downstream trip, but he was not on the upstream trip either. Fortunately, there was a maid beside the wife who prepared her smoking set, fearing that the master also had an affair with her, so she defended him, saying that maybe there was something going on in Hankou and the master stayed in Hankou to wait for the next shift. The wife said that even if he was waiting for the next shift downstream, he clearly said that he was taking this ship upstream.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Gold Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Unpredictable fluctuations of ten taels. Yesterday, the 17th, the gold price continued to weaken. The market was sluggish and fluctuating, with variations of two or three taels being common. However, the entire market had a ten-tael swing, hovering around 40 taels from morning to night. The market was unpredictable and volatile. As for foreign exchange, it eased slightly, and banks made some purchases. Because the swap period had just passed, there were no clear figures. In the early market, Yongfeng and Yuanheng, etc., made some purchases, while Yuanmao, Yongyuan, and Shengjin, etc., had already sold. However, the demand for supply varied among the firms, and there was no sign of bold action. The early market was peaceful because silver bars remained unchanged. Later, rumors spread that there was internal strife in Japan and that opposition to the cabinet was very strong. As a result, people became fearful, and all parties were inclined to sell, suddenly breaking through the 40-tael mark and plummeting by about ten taels. The situation was turbulent, and the market seemed to be in a downward spiral. Furthermore, because buyers were diligent and the exchange rate turned flat, it was pulled up by three taels. Afterwards, the firms sold vigorously at first, but then chased to buy. However, because there was no market for bills of exchange on Wednesdays, and the gold price suddenly fell to 27 taels and 5 mace. Finally, it exceeded the 40-tael mark again. It was found that the low cost of this swap period was actually due to the abundance of cash. Fuchang used to hold a long position, but now it has intensified, turning more to short selling. It is estimated that the October period is still short more than 5,000 contracts. Before the swap date, they prepared to settle in cash because the spot goods collected in September could be sold off. Yesterday, some retail investors who were long also hurriedly dropped out, but the shorts refused to swap, so there was talk of a flat drop.</p>
<p>The market opened peacefully in the morning, then suddenly dropped sharply. The opening price for November was slightly down by 7 cents, totaling 547 taels. The silver price rose slightly by one-eighth, but without much impact. The gross price fell from 47.5 taels to 42.5 taels. The sellers were particularly bold, especially the large firms, who saw a rebound and first announced a price of 43.45 taels, but did not change the listing price. The internal market was still stable. HSBC and the Mai Bank bought British gold for December at 8 pence and for November at 7.9375 pence. Then, they increased the price by two taels to 44.67 taels. After 10 o'clock, the situation deteriorated further due to rumors that the Japanese cabinet might be unstable, causing extreme fear among the general public. Moreover, major firms competed to sell. Dadesheng and Yuancheng, etc., sold heavily, so the price plummeted. Shortly after, it broke through 40 taels and fell to only 38 taels at 11 o'clock. However, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels, and the exchange rate was also weak. The China-Belgium Bank bought one tael and two mace and two fen and two five Japanese gold for the current month. Sumitomo bought eight pence and one eight seven five for the forward period. Afterwards, it seemed to ease, and those who had previously sold then bought back in. And the banks' appetite for British gold was still good, so it pierced through 40 taels to 42.67 taels at 11:30. When the market closed at noon, the price was 41.4 taels, and British gold for this month could be sold at 7.8125 pence, and for December at 8 pence. The announced price was still 603 taels, with a discount of 60 to 65 taels. The noon closing price was over 61 taels.</p>
<p>The market recovered after a dangerous fall of 7.2 taels. The afternoon market opened at 41.3 taels, then at 2.1 taels. Afterwards, the market sentiment weakened due to the heavy selling by Yuda, etc., and fell by more than 4 taels. It was also heard that Indian remittances had also increased to 3 o'clock, suddenly dropping to 37.5 taels (the lowest price yesterday). After that, Zhifengyong and retailers chased to buy, raising the price by more than 3 taels.

However, the exchange rate fell by 7.2 taels compared to the day before due to the suspension of the market on Wednesdays. It was found that the maximum price throughout the day was 47.5 taels and the minimum price was 37.5 taels, a difference of more than 10 taels. The volatility of the market was difficult to grasp. The announced price was still discounted by 62-63 taels, and the recorded prices were 53 taels for September, 45 taels for October, and 41 taels for November.

<h3>Foreign Exchange: Flat at First, Then Looser</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Sell Short to Hedge Gold</p>

However, American silver rose slightly, and the market did not change much. The exchange rate between the British and American continued to rise. The exchange rate between the Japanese and American remained unchanged, while the exchange rate between the British and Japanese increased by 0.09375. It was rumored that the British and American governments were maintaining the price of silver, so major banks would not fall too low. As for the domestic interbank market in this port, the various exchange rates were still stable and peaceful. After stabilizing in the morning, the market weakened as the gold market was sluggish and broke through the 40-tael mark. By noon, the market rebounded, and when the market closed, it was 0.0625 higher for British gold, 0.125 higher for American gold, and 0.0625 lower for Japanese gold compared to the day before. Because it was Wednesday afternoon, and there was no market according to the precedent, Chinese speculators tended to sell short to hedge bars. However, the banks' appetite was not weak. It is estimated that more than 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded. China-Belgium, HSBC, McCarley, Sumitomo, and Zhenjin, etc., made purchases. American gold transactions were stagnant, and only a small number of Japanese exchange transactions were made. Korea sold, while China-Belgium bought. The market was mediocre. It was found that Chinese merchants held short positions in British and Japanese exchanges. They generally hedged into bars.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Booming and Continuing to Rise</h3>
<p>The total turnover for the day reached 15.5 million yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures market for various government bonds was extremely prosperous. Among them, the demobilization transactions were the most lively, with large transactions among major firms. Tariff consolidation and demobilization were also more prosperous than the previous day. Aftermath and 19th-year cigarette bonds were mediocre. Other bonds remained sluggish, and the spot market remained weak. As for the changes in the prices of various government bonds, because they had already risen quite sharply on the previous day, although the buying sentiment continued to be strong, the prices continued to strengthen. However, the demand for supply has been somewhat flat, and the trend is more moderate than before. It is estimated that the total spot market transactions for the day were only 10,000 yuan, and the total futures market transactions amounted to more than 15.52 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower Yarn Market Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>The rise in the yarn market was mainly due to the continuous decline in previous days, which led some profit-takers to cover their short positions. Various factories, burdened by thick inventories, were eager to find outlets, and prices were willing to concede. This attracted buyers from Sichuan and Luzhou, who purchased over 2,000 bales at favorable prices, which were two to three taels lower than the previous purchases. This deal greatly boosted market sentiment. Some manufacturers still limited the purchase price to 9.8 taels, maintaining the opening price of 10.11 taels of the previous market. 1,600 bales were bought in the morning. In the afternoon, demand was active, and retail investors covered their positions, causing the market to rise, but its progress still depended on actual sales.</p>
<p>The human-mark buying interest is still strong. Due to the sluggishness of American cotton, the opening price of the human-mark market was still limited to 8 taels by Hengda manufacturers. Some bulls, due to margin requirements, broke through the 8 taels mark. Hengda bought 1,600 bales, and retail investors bought in the second and third sessions, resulting in a sudden increase. The price of each month increased by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot sales were good and buying interest was tight. Each rose 7, 8, and 9 cents to one tael. Currently, the struggle between bulls and bears is fierce. The total transaction volume for the day was 23,950 bales. It was found that Heshun sold 1,150 bales, Hanfeng 2,100 bales, Yiyu 1,500 bales, Tianchang 1,700 bales, Tianjiang 700 bales, Dachangcheng 800 bales, and the rest 300 to 550 bales. Yiyu bought 3,000 bales, Hengda 1,600 bales, Huanji 1,050 bales, Guangfeng 1,150 bales, Ruida 2,200 bales, Hengde 850 bales, and the rest 300 to 550 bales. The closing prices of the human mark are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Cheap prices and strong spot demand. Spot yarn sales are active due to cheap prices and strong customer demand. It was found that the total purchases from various groups for the day amounted to 3,170 bales, with 140 bales purchased by peers. Among the customer groups, Sichuan bought the most, totaling 1,225 bales, Luzhou purchased 1,220 bales, Guangdong purchased 225 bales, the interior purchased 85 bales, Xuzhou purchased 50 bales, Anqing purchased 50 bales, Niuzhuang purchased 170 bales, and miscellaneous groups purchased 145 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Rebound Due to Rain</h3>
<p>The overall cotton market situation remains flat and sluggish. Because the trend of American cotton is still soft, people's hearts are still uncertain. Spot demand is sluggish, and Indian cotton prices have fallen by another 5 cents. This is due to the easing of exchange rates. Hanbang throws out the goods, and some three merchants limit prices to purchase. As a result, retail investors are also buying to cover their short positions, and the market rebounded. There were even fewer transactions in local cotton. Hankou and Shashi cotton cost 32 taels to reach Shanghai, and the quality is above standard. However, the price of the same type of Huoji new goods as the standard is 32 taels and 2.5 cents, which can still be sent to the factory, because inland merchants are worried that the harvest will be damaged due to bad weather, so they buy it and do not let go.</p>
<p>Most Hanbiao factories maintain. The opening of the Hanbiao market was dull due to the flatness of American cotton and the extremely low price of foreign cotton. There was a lack of buyers and the market atmosphere was loose. However, because a certain factory limited the price of bulls to 2 taels, it slightly increased by 5 cents. In the afternoon, retail investors covered their short positions, and the stock rose sharply by 2 cents. The result was a rise of 1 to 2 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 51,600 dan. It was found that Tianchang sold 3,300 dan, Lichang 3,100 dan, Shenchang 2,300 dan, Ruida 1,900 dan, Xiesheng 1,600 dan, and others 1,200 to 1,100 dan. Gongtai bought 4,700 dan, Xincheng 2,400 dan, Yikang 2,400 dan, Shenchang 1,300 dan, Hengchang 1,800 dan, and the rest 1,200 to 1,500 dan. The closing prices of Hanbiao are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Spot sales are bleak and dull. Spot cotton transactions are flat. Due to the cheap price of foreign cotton, various factories have no intention of large-scale procurement. 2,110 bales of Yao cotton and 300 bales of Tong cotton have arrived, and the sales list is on the left.</p>

<h3>Grain Rice Market in Hexia Slightly Firm Due to Cloudy Weather</h3>
<p>Xin Yangjian Soars by Five or Six Jiao</p>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups was around the 10th. Changbang machine-milled japonica rice suddenly lacked arrivals in Hexia, with only dozens of stones. The price opened at 20 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The arrival of Western Xin japonica rice was also scarce, and the market was calm. The opening price was high at 20 yuan and 5 jiao. Although the inventory of Eastern Xin japonica rice in this port has dried up, the market is still 20 yuan. Xin Yangjian rice soared by 5 or 6 jiao due to cloudy weather. High-quality goods reached 15 yuan and 7 jiao. Xin Dujian rice was quite tight, and street sales were brisk, with the price opening at 16 yuan and a half. Xin Kejian rice also rose by 2 or 3 jiao, and the price reached 14 yuan and 1 or 2 jiao. Zhongguan Xi arrived at 13 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. Bai Yuan's situation was flat, always hovering between 18 yuan and 8 or 9 jiao.</p>
<p>Hunan There were few arrivals in Hexia, and sales were still acceptable. The Northern group's broken japonica rice was also seen to be dwindling, and the accumulation in Lilu was minimal. Therefore, arrivals at the port were unusually deserted. All of the medium and broken japonica rice shops had a wait-and-see attitude, so prices did not develop. The same was true for the Southern group's thin rice. There were only sporadic goods from sailing ships. Therefore, both the japonica and thin rice markets here showed a scarce and slightly tight situation. The buying interest for Xin Yangjian and Xin Jian rice was ordinary, and prices followed the Northern market. The source of goods here was still connected, and if the weather was clear, prices might fall back down. It was not surprising that the price of Bian Yuan rice had a slight increase, and the situation was mediocre. The special top market was on the left side of the 19 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Machine Early Price Slightly Lower by One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer indica rice market was even more sluggish, because both the Hunan and Jiangxi routes had sporadic arrivals, and passenger transport was completely stopped. The street's appetite was flat, and the entire market only opened with 1,500 packages of Jiangxi machine early rice. The market was nearly a corner smaller than the previous day, with prices of 13 yuan and 5 cents, 13 yuan in the middle range, and 12 yuan and 7 or 8 cents to 4 cents and a half. More Jiangxi machine yuan rice arrived, and 327 packages were also traded yesterday at a price of 17 yuan and 8 jiao and a half to 17 yuan, which was also softer than the selling price a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Saigon Rice New Transaction of 500 Tons</h3>
<p>No. 1 rice will be shipped out immediately... Price 7 taels, 5 qian, and 7 fen.</p>
<p>The floating stock of foreign rice on the market has long been sold out. The remaining stock is only the goods left over from rice shops and cheap sales. Recently, due to the lack of high-quality indica rice arrivals and stocks in the market, high-quality foreign rice has the potential to command high prices. Therefore, yesterday, Shanghai merchants and firms again ordered 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon immediate shipment rice from Shunquan Jiang Foreign Firm at a price of 7 taels, 5 qian, and a half per hundred catties of Shenyin. It is expected to arrive at the port on the 2nd of next month.</p>
<h3>Stencil Powder Market Continues to Be Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market in the morning, although the market for each month rebounded once, because the quoted price of foreign wheat rebounded by 4 or 5 jiao and 7 or 8 jiao respectively, and because the spot powder from Tianjin could be loaded and shipped again, people's hearts soared for a while. However, later it was reported that spot goods still could not be declared for loading, and small and medium-sized factories unanimously sold off endlessly, so the market atmosphere recovered. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market for each month still gradually softened. Because the attitude of the factories at the moment was that they were unwilling to abandon the industry due to the cost-effectiveness of foreign wheat, and outsiders sold off quite smoothly, with a depressed outlook for the future. People's hearts were still weak. It was observed that the future was not very related to the export problem, because the general trend was inevitable. As a result, the current month was still small by 5 li, October was small by 2 and a half li, November was small by 1 fen, and December to February was small by 7 and a half li.</p>
<h3>Dumping Wind Prospers and the Wheat Trend Softens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market was momentarily brisk due to the rebound in the quoted price of foreign wheat, which was 3 or 4 fen better than the previous day. However, a certain large short seller (who was close to Qingjia) took the opportunity to throw out goods step by step. Therefore, after the second session, the market turned soft again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the sentiment of the large households was still unabated. The only basis for this was that the price of foreign wheat was only 4 taels and 8 qian, and the factories were still unwilling to throw out the goods. The weakness and depression of people's hearts was certainly not without reason. As a result, the current month fell by 3 fen compared to the previous day, October fell by 5 fen, November fell by 6 fen, December fell by 6 fen, January fell by 4 fen, and February fell by 3 fen. The spot wheat market was slightly better due to the improvement in factory affairs, and the quotations for each grade were slightly better. A total of 7,000 packages of Shashi, Shandong, Haizhou, Taierzhuang, Yaowan, and Haimen wheat were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Thai Yuan Ice Available on Demand</h3>
<p>The market is quite firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's producing area telegram said that the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.125, a drop of 3.125 compared to the previous telegram. The New York futures sugar price for September was 1.11, up 1 point from the previous day; the price for December was 1.18; and the price for March of the next year was 1.29, all up 2 points; the price for May was 1.38, also up 3 points. The current price of Javanese sugar was still 8.625. The price of futures sugar for this month was 8.375, a drop of 1250 from the previous day; the price for October was 8.25; and the price for November was 8.125, all without any increase or decrease. The Association's market divided the price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar into 8 taels for new goods, 8 taels and 2 qian for new goods, and 7 taels and 8 qian for old goods. The import and export was particularly sluggish, and the market situation was calm. No. 9 Dutch red sugar was 6 taels, 3 qian, and 7 and a half fen, and finely ground white sand was 8 taels and 1 qian. Transactions were also scarce.

<p>Shanghai City Fundraising for the 19th Year</p>
<h3>Measures for Customs Treasury Bills</h3>
<p>Borrowing Rent for Two Months</p>
<p>Divided into Two Instalments</p>
<p>Implemented on October 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, under orders to raise short-term Customs Treasury Bills for the 19th year, organized the Shanghai City Fundraising Committee for the 19th Year Customs Treasury Bills to carry out the fundraising. A meeting was held at the Municipal Government Staff Recreation Club on Weihaiwei Road. Attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiyuan, Qin Runqing, Ye Huijun, Wang Yiting, Shen Lianfang, Wang Binyan, Zhang Xiaoliang, Xu Fu, Huang Jin, Shen Tianshen, Yu Hongjun, Yuan Liang, Tang Naikang, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Yi, Zhu Yan, Hu Hongji, Xu Yuanfang, Zhu Hao, and more than 30 others. Chairman Yu Hongjun and Recorder Wang Shaoqi reported that the central government's military victories at the front were expected to end soon, but military supplies and government expenses urgently needed replenishment. Therefore, 50 million yuan of short-term Customs Treasury Bills for the 19th year were issued. The Shanghai Municipal Government was ordered to raise 1 million yuan. As a central government agency, the Municipal Government had a duty to promote the treasury bills. After discussion at the municipal affairs meeting, a fundraising committee was organized, and the mayor appointed the attendees as members. As Chairman Jiang's telegrams had been repeatedly received, urging payment, there was no time to delay. Therefore, the attendees were asked to discuss fundraising measures together. Many of the attendees were local elders, closely linked to the Municipal Government. It was hoped that they would provide strong support to raise the required amount to meet urgent needs. Then, Tang Naikang reported on the process of receiving orders for fundraising. Subsequently, members such as Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Qin Runqing, Ye Huijun, and Shen Tianshen expressed their opinions. It was then decided to borrow rent in exchange for treasury bills. The detailed measures for borrowing rent would be formulated and implemented by the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government then presented the temporary municipal affairs meeting, which approved it and appointed Councilor Xu, Director Tang, Director Pan, Director Zhu, and Director Yuan to discuss the detailed measures for borrowing rent together. A number of proposed measures were then reported (1) The Municipal Government should widely announce the resolution of the Fundraising Committee. (2) The Finance Bureau should be ordered to handle the borrowing of rent and formulate various regulations and budgets. (3) The Public Security Bureau should be ordered to assist the Finance Bureau in borrowing rent. (4) The Public Security Bureau should announce a crackdown on rent arrears and earnestly implement it. All of the above items have been reviewed and approved by the Municipal Government, and orders have been issued to the Finance and Public Security Bureaus for compliance, along with an announcement and publication of the regulations, which are specially recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>Announcement regarding the fundraising for the 19th year short-term Customs Treasury Bills in this city. The matter has been submitted to the 164th Municipal Affairs Meeting of this government. It was resolved to organize a fundraising committee for the 19th year Customs Treasury Bills to raise the required amount on schedule. It was also resolved to borrow rent for two months in exchange for treasury bills and to formulate and implement 12 interim regulations. In addition to distribution, a public announcement is hereby made to all citizens, who should each act with a sense of public spirit and contribute to this endeavor. It should be known that the livelihood of the people and the national economy are closely related, and every citizen has a responsibility for the security situation. The issuance of treasury bills by the central government is originally intended to regulate surpluses and deficits. The guarantees are extremely secure, and the interest rates are also very favorable. The borrowing of rent in this city is also a balanced and responsible obligation. Moreover, the burden is not excessive. In this time of national crisis, the people of Shanghai should naturally not yield to others in generously contributing and always take the lead. Furthermore, this plan is being implemented in various provinces and cities, and Shanghai is widely expected to enthusiastically subscribe, so how can we lag behind others? It is hoped that the citizens will understand that the government is sincere and striving to meet the central government's expectations. It is the sincere hope of this government to commend the citizens and also to protect the legitimate interests of landlords to the greatest extent possible. Rights and obligations are inherently balanced, and public and private interests will naturally benefit both. Treasury bills are no different from savings, and purchasing them is not the same as reckless spending. However, the deadline for treasury bills is approaching, and the government's need for funds is urgent. It is hoped that subscriptions will be made quickly so that reports can be made in time. No delays or wait-and-see attitudes should be taken, as this would delay important needs. The matter is imperative, and there is no room for evasion. You are expected to comply. This is an announcement.</p>

<p>China-Germany Aviation Corporation</p>
<h3>General Manager and Deputy Appointed</h3>
<p>Future Europe-Asia One-Way Only 3.5 Days</p>
<p>News from transportation circles: The China-Germany Aviation Corporation convened a meeting of representatives from both sides in Beijing on the 11th of this month. It was decided that the position of General Manager would be held by Wei Yizhen, the Deputy Minister of Transportation, with the German representative Schmidt as the Deputy. The heads of various groups have also been internally designated. Currently, Schmidt has arrived in Shanghai and has departed for Ping to pick up his family and actively prepare.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the company has now adopted a flexible approach through agreement by both parties, reducing the scope and with the German side solely investing 300,000 yuan as preparatory funds. The opening of the route is still distant, as aircraft must first be dispatched to inspect various routes, arrange aviation stations, etc. In the future, the latest model aircraft will be used, each costing over 100,000 yuan, with settings inside that are sure to satisfy and comfort passengers. A one-way trip from Shanghai to Berlin will only take three and a half days.</p>
<h3>All Circles' Comfort Supplies Bound for Beijing</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Pieces of High-Quality Sanitary Undershirts</p>

It has recently raised tens of thousands of yuan. Considering that the military situation at the front is progressing steadily and the soldiers are working hard, the Association has decided to purchase over 10,000 pieces of high-quality sanitary undershirts, which will soon be shipped to the front. It is heard that half of the funds raised by the Association will be allocated for disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Labor Dispute Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nine Resolution Measures Signed</p>
<p>Resumption of Work on the 22nd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau mediated the strike dispute at the Pudong Sino-Japanese Cotton Mill. As of September 16th, the two sides had reached a deadlock at the mediation table due to a dispute over the bonus issue in the second clause. At that time, the mediation chairman, Guo Yongxi, had also instructed both parties to apply for arbitration according to the law. However, yesterday, the labor and management of the factory voluntarily negotiated a settlement and jointly signed nine settlement measures at the Social Affairs Bureau, thus resolving the dispute. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Course of Events: The Social Affairs Bureau initially worked with the Municipal Civil Training Association to send personnel to mediate repeatedly without success. The Municipal Government then ordered another mediation meeting to be convened according to law. Therefore, a mediation was started on September 12th, and continued on the 15th and 16th for a total of two mediations, but the sides were still not close to agreement.</p>
<p>The Process of Settlement: On the mediation table, the Social Affairs Bureau mediation chairman, Guo Yongxi, inquired about the reasons for the reconciliation of labor and management at the factory.</p>
<p>(1) The labor representatives replied that after yesterday's mediation broke down, they returned to convene various representatives for discussion and unanimously believed that at a time of emergency in the front-line military situation, the rear's security was extremely important. If the work stoppage was prolonged, it would inevitably disrupt social order, and the workers' livelihoods would be difficult after two months of striking, and they would be unable to maintain themselves if work was not resumed. However, the condition for resuming work was to exchange the dismissal of four people by the factory: Fei Wanqing, Ding Zhuo, Ni Chenglu, and Zhang Hanhui. Therefore, they are now requesting a settlement and signing. If the factory continues to keep these four people working at the factory, there will inevitably be many disputes in the future, so their dismissal is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>(2) The management representatives replied that there was no permission to dismiss the four people during yesterday's discussion. However, before the investigation is completed, the four are not allowed to enter the factory to work. The chairman said that since the two sides voluntarily settled, the date of resumption of work should first be determined. The labor representatives stated: (A) The daily worker who repairs the motors can enter the factory on Friday. (B) Due to time constraints, all workers are allowed to resume work on Monday of next week (the 22nd). However, there are two conditions to be included in the contract after this resumption of work: (1) The wages deducted for errors by workers in each workshop shall not exceed five points. (2) Workers shall not be dismissed without reason after resumption of work. After the chairman consulted the management's opinions and repeatedly persuaded them, they finally yielded and signed the settlement agreement.</p>
<p>The Provisions of the Settlement: The provisions of the settlement measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The workers of the Ri-Hua Cotton Mill asked the factory to increase the rice subsidy, which will not be discussed for the time being. Starting from September, the factory will pay each person a monthly bonus of eight dimes until the end of October (according to the summer bonus method).</p>
<p>(2) The factory must award one day's wages to each worker who works a full half month. Those who work a full week of day work and a week of night work within half a month will be awarded two days' wages. The original two cents of silver dollars for each night worker's dinner subsidy is canceled. The factory agrees to give one day of bonus pay for those who have not worked for two full weeks before this strike.</p>
<p>(3) Wages must not be delayed if the work is not sufficient.</p>
<p>(4) The Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to investigate and verify the case of the factory dismissing Yu Qixiang and other seven people for review and handling.</p>
<p>(5) Fei Wanqing and other four persons agitator of the labor unrest case are not allowed to enter the factory to work before the investigation is clarified.</p>
<p>(6) Wages will be paid for four days during the strike period (not paid to those who do not report for work within ten days after resumption of work).</p>
<p>(7) All workers must resume work at 9:00 AM on the 22nd of this month. The repairers and the daily workers of the motor manager are allowed to go to work first at 2:00 PM on the 18th.</p>
<p>(8) The wages deducted for errors by workers in each workshop shall not exceed five points.</p>
<p>(9) Workers shall not be dismissed without reason after resumption of work.</p>

<h3>Japanese Trade Report with China</h3>
<p>Recent Situation and Expansion</p>
<p>Japan attaches the utmost importance to foreign trade, and it is making every effort to promote Japanese goods in the Chinese market, especially in Shanghai. The business of importing and exporting in Shanghai in August was affected by the current situation, and most of them showed a declining trend. However, the situation in Sino-Japanese trade within this month was not bad. The Japanese authorities in this port compiled and investigated the Sino-Japanese trade in August and obtained the following overview:</p>
<p>Import and Export Volume: The total value of Japanese goods imported into Shanghai in August was 47 million yuan, while the value of exports from this port to Japan was 37 million yuan. Compared with the same period last year, the import was 53.5 million yuan and the export was 38.7 million yuan. In contrast, this year's Japanese goods arriving in Shanghai are not as good as last year.</p>
<p>Sugar Sales: Japanese sugar sales in our country are very large. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, when mooncakes are put on the market, the amount of Japanese sugar transported to our country is always greater than usual. Japanese sugar merchants expect to sell one million bags before the Mid-Autumn Festival, of which 300,000 bags will be sold in the Yangtze River area, 300,000 bags in the French Concession, 200,000 bags in the North and South Oceans, and 200,000 bags in other ports. Currently, there are 300,000 bags of Japanese sugar stored in Shanghai, so recent Japanese sugar imports are being rushed.</p>
<p>Ship Berthing: In August, the shipping industry was the most sluggish. The reason was that transportation in various places was affected by the current situation, and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were harassed by Communist Party disturbances. Therefore, there were 22,000 tons of ships berthed at this port, totaling 3,000 to 5,000 tons of ships that suspended operations in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Cotton Textile Industry: The factories in Shanghai have recently been affected by strikes for more than 45 days, so their business has suffered considerable losses, especially the textile industry.</p>
<p>Meeting and Expansion: The Japanese authorities in Shanghai, in order to discuss the development of trade with China, gathered important Japanese merchants last Saturday to hold a meeting to discuss how to proceed. The details of the discussion are being kept secret and will not be announced.</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Bans Buildings</h3>
<p>Director Wu of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau stated that as the commerce of various areas, cities, and towns in the county is becoming increasingly prosperous, there is no regulation of buildings, etc., resulting in uneven streets and haphazard construction projects. In order to protect the safety of residents and facilitate transportation, he has drafted regulations to be followed. In the future, people must obtain a permit before starting to build houses.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Shipping Special News</h3>
<p>Wuhu Resumes Service: Taikoo &amp; Co.’s newly built oil-powered Yangtze River ship, the "Wuhu", is the newest and fastest ship on the Yangtze River.  After starting service in July, it only ran once due to improvements in the machinery and boilers, and then underwent major repairs. The cabins of all classes on the ship have been further renovated, and the cargo hold at the pilot's platform and the officer's cabins have been completely redecorated, making them more beautiful than before. It has now been completed and is scheduled to officially join the Shanghai-Yichang route starting on the 22nd of this month. The trip will be two days faster than ordinary Yangtze River ships. This is the first Yangtze River diesel fast ship, and Jardine Matheson is also rushing to build the new "Baohe" ship in order to compete, and plans to start sailing in early October, also on the Shanghai-Yichang route.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Ship Alert: In the past half month, the Yangtze River ships "Xiangze", "Shengjing", "Yunyang", "Gonghe", "Changyang", "Dang".</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>"Yiyang", "Taishun", and "Jianguo" have been shot at by bandits in Fuchi, Haoxue, Xinhekou, Qichun, and Wuxue. Recently, the Japanese ship "Dongming Maru" was also shot at by bandits in Daye. The British, Japanese, and American foreign ships have agreed that in addition to sending troops to guard the ships from Yichang to Hankou and from Hankou to Jiujiang, the British, American, and Japanese sides will also send one or two Yangtze River defense gunboats to each location to escort the ships starting on the 14th.</p>
<p>"Yushun" Detained: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Yushun" ship was ordered to sail to Nanjing this time. Yesterday, a telegram from the Wuhu Customs stated that the ship was detained because the rice transport documents did not match. The matter has been telegraphed to the Ministry of Transportation. Since this matter is not related to the Bureau, it should be negotiated by those in charge of military grain.</p>
<p>"Wuxing" Released: Sanbei Company’s "Wuxing" ship was detained in Wanxian after private soil was found on board. The principal offender of the smuggling case was fined 11,000 yuan. After several weeks of repeated negotiations and a telegram from the Shanghai Bureau to Chongqing requesting Liu Xiang to transfer it to Zhou Sheng San to release the ship, a telegram was received yesterday stating that the ship was released on the 14th and is now sailing to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Various Real Estate Companies</p>
<h3>Joint Letter Sent to the Five Chinese Directors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Concerning Water Company Coercion</p>
<p>Various real estate companies in the Public Concession jointly sent a letter yesterday to Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Mengjia, and other Chinese directors of the Public Concession, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of increasing the water price by 25%, we are very pleased with the efforts of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Concession and the efforts of your directors. At 4 PM this afternoon, the board of directors of the Municipal Council proposed a review, which is greatly appreciated by all residents. However, the Shanghai Water Company is inevitably coercing new users to acknowledge the price increase and sign contracts before connecting the water. Water is a necessity for residents, like holding someone by the throat and demanding money. The situation is serious, so we are sending a special letter to request your directors to ask the Municipal Council to instruct the Shanghai Water Company not to coerce new users to acknowledge the increase before connecting the water, etc.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Administrative Meeting</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Government held a county administrative meeting at 1 PM yesterday. Qiu Mingjiu chaired the meeting, and Zhang Ruyu recorded the minutes. The resolutions were as follows:</p>
<p>Item 1: Director Qian of the Construction Bureau proposed that the urban area of this county is too small, and the streets are not marked with names, and the house numbers are not numbered. In the future, the promulgation and implementation of various regulations on banning buildings and widening roads must rely on the clear designation of street names and house numbers to facilitate judgment. It is very important to the construction. It is proposed to immediately survey detailed maps of the streets in the city and start investigating and numbering house numbers as the basis for urban construction. Once the urban area is successfully managed, it will be extended to other areas. As for the implementation method, it is expected that a brief regulation will be drafted and submitted to the county for approval. The case was resolved that the Construction Bureau will draft detailed measures in advance, formulate rules, and then submit them to the meeting for review.</p>
<p>Item 2: The county-run farm presented the method of purchasing and promoting cottonseeds and retaining good seeds for rolling and requested discussion. The case was resolved to be forwarded to the Department of Agriculture and Mining for instructions.</p>
<p>Item 3: Each district reported that the continuous rain this year has resulted in a very poor autumn harvest, requesting an on-site survey. The case was resolved that the County Government Finance Bureau will send personnel to conduct a joint on-site survey and submit a summary before the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Item 4: The Finance Bureau presented the resolution of deducting 335.44 yuan for the 16th year of uncompleted busy canal silver from the amount collected in August, and it is proposed to distribute the roster of individual fees and subsidies to the bureaus and farms for one month each. The surplus will be temporarily deposited in the County Government, and the amount collected in September will be merged for disposal. The case was resolved to pass.</p>
<p>Item 5: The Civil Affairs Department ordered the payment of overdue school police subsidies and clothing fees. How should they be raised? The case was resolved to be forwarded to the Public Security and Finance Bureaus for investigation and resolution.</p>
<p>Municipal Port Authority</p>
<h3>To Take Over Dada Wharf Within Days</h3>
<p>Leasing and Other Matters Will Be Handled by the Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Port Authority is preparing to recover the wharves in Nanshi at a price. It is now known that the evaluation committee for Nanshi wharves has assessed the value of Dada Shipping Company's eight wharves at 162,900 yuan, with an additional 100,000 yuan in compensation for losses. All procedures have been completed, and the Municipal Port Authority will take over starting on the 19th of this month. From now on, all matters such as leasing wharves will be handled by the Municipal Port Authority.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Request to Re-Examine Trade Regulations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday regarding the issue of trade compliance with industry regulations, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the presentation, on the 16th of this month, Instruction No. 1820 from your Bureau was received, opening the case. Instruction No. 5624 from the Municipal Government was received, and it contains Instruction No. 3225 from the Executive Yuan:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of acting on the order: The Chairman issued document No. 4552 from the Civil Service Office of the National Government, stating that the trade regulations presented by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce after the resolution of the members' representative assembly and approved for registration by the trade association should be regarded as special regulations for the industry issued by the government. All trades not entering the association should also comply, which is essential to remedy the dissolution of the national system. The case was transferred to the Executive Yuan for review. In response, a copy of the original document was enclosed for reference and handling. The Municipal Government's document No. 235 was copied and forwarded, requesting a review. The case was transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied that trade regulations are not laws and cannot be enforced, and the trade regulations set by various industries often contain monopolistic characteristics or violate good customs. The supervisory authority is not aware of the industry's situation, and even if it is filed, it is still difficult to ensure that there will be no abuses. Such bad regulations, in legal terms, are difficult to protect even if taken to court. Why should trades be forced to comply with them? Therefore, regardless of the content of the regulations, all regulations approved by the government, whether entered or not, must be complied with, which not only does not help but also causes disputes. The statement in the presentation that trades not entering the association should also comply with the regulations is not appropriate. The review and reply from the Ministry are acceptable. In addition to instructing and recording the case and replying to the Civil Service Office for submission, the Municipal Government should be instructed to investigate and handle the case.</p>
<p>In this case, the Bureau previously forwarded the presentation to the Municipal Government after review and informed it. Before receiving the order, the association was ordered to investigate and handle the case and forward the information for notice. Underneath, it says that the official authority’s responsibility is to handle industrial and commercial affairs within the area under its jurisdiction. If the regulations requested for registration by various industries have monopolistic implications or violate good customs, it is difficult to approve them easily. All cases of rejection can be investigated. The order of the department states that even if it has been filed, it is still difficult to ensure that there will be no abuses. The official management seems unlikely to be so careless. It also states that this type of bad industry regulations is difficult to protect even if filed in court. If such a statement is established, even if trades entering the association file lawsuits in order to protect their interests, they will not be guaranteed. The association has stated that all industry regulations are not enough to bind those who are not members of the association and even the members of the association, the association has no binding force, not to mention the welfare and benefits of the trade. The country's permission to establish trade associations is clearly recognized as being for the maintenance of public interest and to correct business abuses. If the regulations approved for registration by various trade associations are denounced as "often containing monopolistic characteristics and violating good customs", then the establishment of trade associations is tantamount to creating a monopolistic organization for the trade. If this is true, wouldn't merchants file lawsuits and wouldn't the authorities dissolve these trade associations? The focus of the departmental order is that most of the industry regulations do not conform to good customs and that the authorities have not been able to review them in detail, so even if they are filed, it is difficult to ensure that there are no abuses. This level should be explained by the authorities in detail without redundant statements from the association. However, since the departmental order states that the supervisory authority should still carefully review the industry regulations with reference to good commercial practices in order to reduce disputes, and that if the content of the regulations does not violate good commercial customs, after careful review and approval by the government, it is tantamount to a recognized business practice of the industry. If the scope of travel is limited to member of the association, those who are not members of the association will take advantage of personal interests, and the members of the association will withdraw one after another, the association will collapse like a tile and will only exist in form. It is not an empty talk. The operating practices of an industry that do not conflict with commercial laws and regulations have the effect of supplementing the legal effectiveness of the practice. The agreed filing of industry regulations is actually the written commercial customs. It cannot be said that it has no compulsory effect in terms of the common example of supplementing laws and regulations with customs, and the order for non-member trades to comply is indeed necessary according to the facts and is not without a basis in law. Therefore, it is appropriate to submit a document to the Bureau for your review and approval of whether to continue to submit a request to the Municipal Government, or to the Ministry or the Executive Yuan, to ask them to re-examine the matter. The Bureau's decision will be awaited with anticipation.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<h3>Explanation of Union Membership Qualifications</h3>
<p>Previously, the Chinese and Foreign Cotton Industry Workers' Union had presented a request to the Municipal Council due to ambiguities in the Trade Union Law regarding the qualifications for union membership. The Municipal Council then forwarded the request for interpretation. The Bureau's instruction, which had been received, stated (above omitted). Now, Municipal Government Instruction No. 5655 states: "Upon reviewing the aforementioned request from the Chinese and Foreign Cotton Industry Workers' Union for an interpretation of the qualifications for union membership as stipulated in the Trade Union Law, this request was forwarded and presented for compliance. It has been instructed by the Executive Yuan that the Bureau is to be informed. Executive Yuan Instruction No. 3209 states: 'The Ministry has submitted a response stating that regarding the original request: (1) If a worker, having obtained membership qualifications according to Article 1 or 2 of the Trade Union Law, is subsequently appointed as an employer or their agent in the same occupation or industry, does their membership still exist? According to the proviso of Article 2 of the Trade Union Law, employers or their agents are not included. Therefore, employers or their agents are not qualified to join a union as members. Consequently, when a member is appointed as an employer or their agent, their membership should cease to exist. (2) If a union member loses their membership due to being appointed as an employer or agent in a different occupation or industry, and later returns to being a worker, is their membership automatically restored, or must they apply for union membership again? Obtaining union membership requires applying for membership, and the continuation of membership should follow the same procedure to be compliant. Therefore, if a member loses their membership due to being appointed as an employer or their agent in the same occupation or industry, they must reapply for union membership upon returning to work as a worker to regain their membership. (3) If a worker possesses the qualifications in Article 1, Sections 1 and 2, of the Trade Union Law and joins a union in a different occupation or industry, can they then join a union in the same occupation or industry as a member? According to Article 19 of the Trade Union Law, a worker may only join a union in the same industry or occupation. The fundamental principle of this law is that one worker can only join one union. A member who has already joined a union in a different occupation or industry cannot join another union until they withdraw from the first union. (4) If a worker in location A requests a transfer of membership to a union in the same occupation or industry in location B due to a change in work location, can the union in location B charge a membership fee and require them to fill out a union application form, or can the union in location A transfer their membership fee and application form to the union in location B? Although the unions in location A and location B belong to the same industry or occupation, their organizations are not connected and remain separate entities. Therefore, if a member of the union in location A requests to join the union in location B due to a change in work location, it should not be regarded as a transfer of membership, and the membership continuation procedure should be followed accordingly.' Upon receiving and reviewing the Ministry's response, it is deemed appropriate. In addition to instructions, the Municipal Government is hereby ordered to investigate and handle the matter accordingly." Following this order, the Bureau is hereby ordered to comply and instruct compliance. Following this order, the Union is hereby ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Petitions from Various Trade Unions</p>
<h3>Abolish Old Practices of Dismissal</h3>
<p>Various trade unions in the city, because the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau had announced that the dismissal of employees would temporarily follow the old practices of various industries, believing this hindered the original labor-capital contracts and caused many labor-capital disputes, jointly petitioned the Municipal Training Council to request the Municipal Government to order the Social Affairs Bureau to revoke Announcement No. 146. The petition stated: "[Petition for the revocation of Social Affairs Bureau Announcement No. 146 by order of the Municipal Government to uphold the labor movement. We, the unions, believe that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Announcement No. 146 of August 8, which allows the temporary use of old industry practices for the hiring and firing of employees, and the news reported in various local newspapers on August 26 regarding the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's investigation into industry dismissal practices, have caused widespread anxiety. It is clear that various industries in this city have established legal group organizations, and most have signed labor-capital contracts with articles stipulating dismissal methods. Why should there be any further changes or a need to continue using old, outdated practices? This is why we are requesting the revocation of Social Affairs Bureau Announcement No. 146. Firstly, the various trade unions in this city have been legally organized, and the existing labor-capital contracts they have concluded should be jointly observed by both labor and capital. In the past, the Social Affairs Bureau has issued clear statements during holidays and festivals, stating that employers in various industries must not use old practices to dismiss employees without reason. This is why we are requesting the revocation of Social Affairs Bureau Announcement No. 146. Secondly, it has been possible to maintain peace and stability when the industries have stipulated that employees cannot be dismissed without reason. If the old dismissal practices of the three sections are allowed to be used, there will be unlimited hiring and firing of employees, and the rights of the original contract will inevitably be stripped away. The number of unemployed workers will increase in our backward industrial and commercial nation, and social order may be disrupted. This is why we are requesting the revocation of Social Affairs Bureau Announcement No. 146. Thirdly, in the past, labor-capital disputes have arisen because workers were dismissed without reason, leading to the escalation of labor unrest that was difficult to resolve. The disputes were only resolved after party and government agencies repeatedly convened meetings to mediate and sign contracts. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau has clearly announced that employers can use the old dismissal practices of the three sections, which will only lead to more disputes and be of no benefit to employers, causing social unrest. This is why we are requesting the revocation of Social Affairs Bureau Announcement No. 146. Fourthly, in summary, Announcement No. 146 of the Social Affairs Bureau has a significant impact on the future of the labor movement and social order. We are compelled to express our concerns and request that your Council swiftly forward this petition to the Municipal Government, ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to revoke the aforementioned announcement immediately. The labor movement will be fortunate, and the party and nation will be fortunate. Respectfully submitted (below omitted).]"</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Pre-Orders Japanese Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>Ordering 80,000 Silkworm Egg Cards</p>
<p>To Prevent a Cocoon Shortage Next Year</p>
<p>The production of summer and autumn cocoons in this city and other areas has not been very smooth, and the quality is relatively poor, which has caused considerable concern among silk factories. Previously, Japanese cocoons were purchased and imported as a temporary remedy. However, due to opposition from various parties, this could not be continued. Yesterday, it was learned that the silk industry is planning to contact Japan to pre-order silkworm eggs in order to prevent a cocoon shortage next year and improve the quality. Contact has already been made, and it is planned to ship as many as 800 cards of silkworm eggs to China next spring. The Japanese government, in order to encourage the export of silkworm eggs to China, plans to issue certificates of conformity to prove their quality.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Request for Thorough Investigation of Tax Card Detention of Yarn</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council sent a letter to the Special Commissioner of Finance for Jiangsu Province, stating: "On the 15th of this month, according to a letter from the Local River Steamer Association of this city, a member of our association, Xie Xing Steamer Bureau, reported that on September 7, their steamer Xie Feng towed a cargo ship to Changshu. As usual, they declared and submitted their tax tickets at the tax card checkpoint in Taipu Temple. However, the yarn tax inspectors claimed that the yarn tax was incorrect. The ship's escort declared that the ten pieces of yarn loaded from the Huacheng Cloth Factory in Jiangyin today had the same tax tickets and were not incorrect. They requested that the inspectors check and verify the tickets to avoid delay and prevent the ship from falling behind schedule. However, the inspectors were stern and insisted that there must be an inconsistency and that five pieces of yarn must be deposited before the ship could be released. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the ship's escort had no choice but to instruct the crew to delay departure and report back to the bureau. After learning about the situation, the bureau immediately dispatched six colleagues to Zhou Temple to meet with Mr. Xu and Mr. Shen of the yarn tax inspection office, requesting that they re-verify the tickets and confirm that there were no inconsistencies. They were immediately released, but this incident caused a delay of more than twelve hours. The steamer waited with its fires burning, consuming a large amount of coal, and the arrival was inevitably delayed. Passengers and cargo owners complained, resulting in a loss of credit and money for no reason. The situation is truly unbearable. Our bureau has never engaged in the practice of underreporting taxes. Now, the inspectors intentionally created difficulties, neither checking the packages nor making a prompt decision. If this continues, the consequences will be dire. We have no choice but to submit a letter detailing the events of that day, requesting that the Council forward it to the Jiangsu Provincial Special Tax Bureau for a strict prohibition against future detentions of ships under false pretenses, and to impose appropriate punishment on the inspectors in order to maintain navigation and facilitate transportation." Upon receiving the letter, the Council believes that the ten pieces of cotton yarn were not a large quantity and could have been easily checked. However, the inspectors ignored the facts and made false accusations, creating difficulties intentionally. It is feared that the inspectors would not be able to justify their actions. Therefore, we are submitting this letter to request that the Council forward it to the Jiangsu Provincial Special Tax Bureau for a thorough investigation and appropriate punishment to maintain navigation and deter improper practices. Upon review, the Tax Bureau should handle its affairs fairly, emphasizing both taxation and consideration for merchants. The Xie Feng Steamer Bureau loaded ten pieces of cotton yarn and passed through the Zhou Taipu Temple. If the tax card checkpoint suspected that the tax tickets were incorrect, it was within their authority to check the items. Since the number of items was small, it would have been easy to verify the tickets without hindering taxation or navigation. This would have been the proper way to handle the situation. However, the tax card checkpoint did not immediately verify the tickets but insisted on depositing the yarn as collateral, knowing that the steamer bureau would be held responsible by the customers for delivering fewer pieces of yarn. This unnecessary procedure was intentionally used to cause trouble for Xie Feng. By the time the bureau sent personnel to plead for a re-verification and the tickets were confirmed to be correct, the ship's departure had been delayed by more than twelve hours. The responsibility for the wasted coal and the losses incurred by cargo owners and passengers due to the delayed arrival should be borne by whom? If the blame lies with the steamer bureau, then Xie Feng Steamer had neither over-declared nor underreported the yarn and had repeatedly requested a verification of the yarn. The tax card point had no cause to make a false accusation and should follow the order to examine the cargo, so there was no reason to delay the shipping by 12 hours. Therefore, in this case, the fault lies with the tax card. Given the aforementioned situation, we are requesting that your office inform the Special Tax Bureau to investigate the personnel responsible for the delay and punish them accordingly to serve as a warning and prevent future occurrences. This will truly uphold public interests. Addressed to the Branch Office of the Special Commissioner of Finance for Jiangsu Province, Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Request for Relief for Victims of the Shaanxi-Sichuan Disaster</h3>
<p>Report from the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee yesterday received a disaster relief letter from the Pucheng, Shaanxi branch of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, which is recorded below: "We are deeply grateful for your previous appeals, which have greatly benefited us. Unfortunately, the disaster situation in our Pucheng is compounded. Since the hailstorm in 1927, the land has been barren for more than three years, and no crops have been harvested. This year, there was still hope for an autumn harvest, but locusts have successively caused disasters, stripping and devouring all the autumn seedlings. The disaster is even more severe than before. If it were not for the relief efforts of various philanthropists, the ordinary victims would have no means of survival. Among the most tragic are the orphans and vulnerable women. Since the disaster, the strong have fled to all directions, and the old and weak have fallen into ditches. Those who remain are homeless children wandering about. The sound of their wailing is unbearable to hear, and their miserable state is unbearable to witness. Now that autumn is approaching and the weather is getting colder, if we do not set up a method to help them soon, they will inevitably die of cold and hunger. Our Association cannot bear to stand idly by, so we are planning to set up an orphanage and educational institution so that homeless children can enjoy both education and care. On the one hand, we will cultivate useful talents for the country, and on the other hand, we will live up to the enthusiasm of the various philanthropists who have provided relief. We know that the gentlemen of the sea are happy to do good deeds and will surely provide their support." The Association also received letters from Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Su Minsheng, and Mr. Zhang Yuquan reporting on the Chongqing disaster as follows: "We have just received a telegram from the Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan, stating that a huge disaster has occurred, resulting in a great calamity. On the day in question, a fire broke out at Chuqimen in Chongqing due to negligence. The strong winds caused the fire to spread into the city, branching out and spreading north to Sanpai坊, west to Daliangzi, south to Jinzimen, and down to Taipingmen, turning everything into scorched earth. The suburbs are densely populated by the poor, and the city is a gathering place for commercial warehouses and merchants. The fire was finally extinguished at 10 p.m., covering an area of several miles and affecting more than 10,000 households. The victims were burned and scarred, and their cries shook the sky, creating an unprecedentedly tragic scene. We witnessed the tragedy and were heartbroken. In addition to supervising the various gangs of water dragons to put out the fire at the time, we inspected the rubble afterwards and saw endless piles of rubble and victims eating in the open air and waiting to be fed. We are now preparing emergency relief to provide temporary assistance, but the disaster area is too large and the need for relief is immense. Chongqing has suffered from years of military affairs and commercial difficulties, coupled with this year's severe drought. Just as it was beginning to recover, it suffered a major disaster. We can only send a telegram appealing to all parties, institutions, legal entities, merchants, philanthropists, and charitable people in all regions to have compassion for the severity of the disaster and to provide generous relief, so that not only will the tens of thousands of victims receive kindness, but the entire Chongqing people will be deeply grateful." Upon receiving this telegram, it was determined that the disaster in Chongqing was extremely severe, affecting tens of thousands of victims. Living in the open air during these autumn nights with autumn winds and rain is truly pitiful. Moreover, winter is approaching, and without food, how will they survive the year? Therefore, we are forwarding the telegram on their behalf, earnestly requesting that you quickly take steps to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Botched Kidnapping, Three Die Tragically</h3>
<p>Bandits Kill Chauffeur</p>
<p>Police Shoot Dead One Bandit</p>
<p>Infant Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Another Kidnapper Captured Alive</p>
<p>At around 10 a.m. yesterday, a kidnapping occurred suddenly at Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. The bandits first robbed the hand pistol worn by a Chinese constable on duty at No. 186 on that road and then forced their way onto the victim's car, holding guns to watch over them. The bandits then expelled the chauffeur from the car. With a bandit at the wheel, attempting to start the car, the engine would not turn over as the driver had cut it off. This angered the bandits, and one fired three shots in succession, hitting the driver in the right chest, right rib and left leg. He fell instantly to the ground, dead with a pool of blood. The bandits abandoned the victim and scattered south in flight. At that moment, Detective Gao Xinfa, No. 50 of the French Concession Police, was patrolling nearby. On hearing the alarm he bravely rushed forward, catching one bandit and bringing him to the police station. Simultaneously, Chinese constable No. 98, hearing the alarm, rushed up to pursue a fleeing bandit, who was running south and firing back at the arresting officer. The Chinese constable returned fire, pursuing the robber as far as Dapu Bridge in the Chinese Settlement. There, with the help of police from the local area, they surrounded the bandit, who then bolted into a grass shack at No. 75 on the street and fired outwards, resisting arrest. By this time, the Lokawei Police Station had received a telephone call from patrolman No. 186, and Chief Beaulac, Detective Inspector Jin Jiu, Lee Chung, Detective Lee Yaolong, and detectives Guan Jinsheng, Guo Bingquan and others sped to the location and surrounded the building. The bandit was shot dead inside the shack. When the bandit ran into the shack he saw a baby and because it cried out loud he shot and killed it. The police then had the body of the dead chauffeur taken to the Tung Jen Fu Yuan Tang Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. According to Zhao Xiangbao, from Shaoxing, the captured bandit, the bandit killed in the Chinese area was named Yang Cai. He unhesitatingly confessed to conspiring and organising the kidnapping. District Chief Wang of the Second District then ordered the summoning of the local police chief and asked the court, along with the family of Wang Lianfu, the owner of No. 75, to examine the body of the two-year-old baby Xiao Sanzi.</p>
<p>Outside the Port of Wusong on Various Islands</p>
<h3>Sea Bandits Appear and Disappear Without Fixed Pattern</h3>
<p>Water Police Conduct Search in Different Directions</p>
<p>Public Notice for Citizens to Assist in Investigation</p>
<p>Of late, in the waters off Si礁, Huanglong 石首, Shengshan 嵊山 and other islands outside the Port of Wusong, there have been large groups of sea bandits gathering in the waters or entrenched on the islands. This has caused merchants to hesitate and residents to flee. Chen Xin, the captain of the 16th Detachment of the 4th District of the Wusong Water Police and commander of the Overseas Self-Defense Corps, yesterday ordered all his squads and self-defense corps to strictly search for and suppress the bandits separately. At the same time, a notice was issued to the residents of the flood-stricken area to assist in the investigation of the bandits' trail, so as to facilitate the suppression and arrest of the bandits. Do not knowingly remain silent, lest you be suspected of harboring bandits. Do not cause trouble without reason. We should all work together to clear the area and live in peace.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Execution of Pan Zhi</h3>
<p>Criminal Convicted of Murdering an Englishman</p>
<p>Corpse Claimed After Post-Mortem Examination Today</p>
<p>Pan Zhi, a Cantonese man, was employed as an assistant to Mr. Greattree, an Englishman and customs official serving as a chief clerk. Seeing Mr. Greattree's luxurious lifestyle, Pan Zhi conceived a malicious plan to rob and murder him. On July 19th, at 1:00 AM, he took advantage of Mr. Greattree's deep sleep in his bedroom on the third floor of 859 North Szechuan Road. He broke into the room wielding a kitchen knife, killing his employer on the spot. He was immediately apprehended and sentenced to death by the Shanghai Special District Court. The sentence was submitted to and approved by the provincial government for execution by hanging. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Special District Court ordered that the prisoner Pan be brought forth for identification. After confirming his identity, he instructed the concession police to escort the prisoner to the District Court for execution. The District Court appointed Prosecutor Yang Qi as the execution supervisor. Mr. Yang, along with Secretary Li Dingpan and Examiner Tong Zhiming, and ordered Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Officer Chen Xihui, and selected executioners Gu Hanqing, Xue Bingzhang, Zhu WanYuan, and assistant Hu Xianglin, rushed to the Caohejing Second Prison execution ground. The prosecutor, together with Warden Dong, ascended to their official positions. The prisoner was brought forth and stated that he was 30 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong, and had no fixed address in Shanghai. When asked if he had any last words for his family, he replied that a dying man had no need to trouble himself. The prosecutor immediately ordered the execution. Under the direction of Police Chief Yang, the executioners bound the prisoner as prescribed to a wooden stake, wrapped a rope around his neck, and slowly tightened it. The process lasted an hour. After the examiner confirmed the death, the secretary affixed a seal to the execution rope, to be examined again today before the body is claimed.</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Counterfeit Twenty-Cent Coins</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Coins, a Considerable Number</p>
<p>Mixed into Circulation, Causing Significant Harm</p>
<p>Hongda Money Shop Arrests Three People</p>
<p>Hongda Fuji Small Money Shop, located at 208 Shandong Road, specialized in privately selling counterfeit twenty-cent and ten-cent coins. They sold them at a price of two silver dollars for fifteen counterfeit twenty-cent coins. Small cigarette and paper shops, solely for their own private gain, would purchase these counterfeit twenty-cent coins and mix them with genuine ones, passing them off. As a result, the number of counterfeit twenty-cent coins circulating in the market has been increasing daily, disrupting the financial system and causing significant harm. The most affected were various peddlers, who, after a day of hard work, if they unknowingly received one or two counterfeit coins, would see their day's earnings vanish. The General Inspectorate of the General Police Station had heard rumors of this and dispatched Detective Feng Shuofu to investigate. Only recently did they discover that the small money shop was the source of the counterfeit coins. They sent Chen Jixiang to purchase fifteen counterfeit coins, obtaining evidence. On the morning of the 10th, Chief Detective Lu Liankui, along with Detectives Pang Ruiqing, Feng Zhiming, and Officer Wu Hanzhang, rushed to Hongda Money Shop. A search revealed two thousand counterfeit twenty-cent coins and one hundred and forty-two counterfeit ten-cent coins, a considerable amount. The accountant, Shen Jinliang from Wuxi, and associates Dai Weixin from Zhenjiang and Wu Wuchang (also known as Wu Fuqi) from Yangzhou, were arrested. The owner of the shop was not found. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Shanghai Special District Court, where Judge Zhou Ting questioned them. The police's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the police's investigation into the matter and requested a thorough interrogation. Shen and the other two claimed that the ten-cent coins were received as payments and that their silver content was slightly inferior, so they planned to send them to a silver smelter to be melted down. They hired lawyer Wang Fuchang to defend them. The court ordered the defendants to be held and investigated for seven days before further questioning.</p>
<h3>Paper Pistols</h3>
<p>Indistinguishable from Real Ones in the Dark</p>
<p>Used to Scare and Extort Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>Cai and Zhu Arrested Together</p>
<p>Cai Youlin and Zhu Jinde, both from Jiangbei, hired a rickshaw driven by Chen Chishi of the Huguangxing rickshaw company at around 1:00 AM yesterday in front of the Wing On Company on Nanjing Road, saying they were going to Yuezhou Road. As they passed Peng Road and Kunshan Garden, Officers No. 691 (Chinese) and No. 375 (Western) of the Hongkou Police Station were patrolling the area. Seeing Cai and Zhu traveling late at night and acting suspiciously, they ordered the rickshaw to stop for inspection. Cai suddenly threw something away and fled. The officers first apprehended Zhu and then chased and caught the fleeing Cai. They picked up the object Cai had discarded and saw that it was a pistol made of stiff cardboard. The cardboard was painted black, and when held in the hand in the dark, it was indistinguishable from a real pistol. They then searched Zhu and found another paper pistol hidden on his person. They immediately took them to the police station. At 9:00 AM, they were sent to the Shanghai Special District Court, and the two rickshaw pullers, Chen and Hu, were summoned to court to testify. Judge Feng questioned them about the purpose of carrying the objects. Cai confessed that due to prolonged unemployment and financial difficulties, he specially made the paper pistols and hid them on his person to scare and extort money from fellow rickshaw pullers from the same hometown. Last night, he and Zhu first hired two rickshaws and went to secluded places like Zhujiamuqiao, where they used the fake pistols to extort sixteen small silver coins and fourteen copper coins, which they split with Zhu. They then hired Chen's rickshaw and were about to use the same trick. He said the fake pistol was made by Zhu. Zhu admitted to making the fake pistol from cardboard and did not deny it. However, he claimed this was the first time they had used this method of extortion. It is deplorable that in these times, human hearts are not what they used to be and there are endless scams. The judge, fearing that Cai and Zhu might have committed other crimes, ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Flower Gambling is Deeply Harmful</h3>
<p>Addiction to Flower Gambling Leads to Economic Hardship</p>
<p>Unmarried Couple Dies Together</p>
<p>Guo Changqing (28 years old) from Shaoxing and his fiancée, Ms. Li (24 years old), were addicted to flower gambling. Recently, due to economic hardship, both had suicidal thoughts. At 8:00 PM, they checked into a room at the Fachang Inn in Weixiang Lane on Avenue Dubail and simultaneously swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. The next day at noon, the tea boy, Jin Guiyuan, noticed that Guo and his fiancée were still lying in bed. He knocked on the door but received no response. He climbed over the partition wall and saw that Guo was barely alive and Ms. Li was already dead. The inn reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to transport Guo to Renji Hospital for treatment. A letter was found on his person detailing the events and flower gambling slips. Ms. Li's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuantang for a post-mortem examination. As no relatives were found, the French Concession Police Criminal Division reported the case to Judge Zhu of the French Court. At 2:30 PM, Judge Zhu arrived at the morgue and confirmed that the deceased had committed suicide by poisoning. He ordered photographs to be taken and the court provided a coffin for the burial. It was reported that Guo died in the hospital at around 9:00 PM last night due to severe poisoning, despite attempts to save him.</p>
<h3>Yu Qingyu's Appeal; Trial of Wu Jianguang et al. Opens</h3>
<p>Judgment Scheduled for the 23rd</p>
<p>Wu Jianguang, Wang Yonghai, Wang Zhenhai, and the two sons of the deceased Chai Wenzhong, Cai Fa and Cai Gao, were previously sued by Kuomintang member Yu Qingyu for deceiving the public with superstitious talk and obtaining money through fraud. The Shanghai Special District Court concluded the trial and declared Wu and the others not guilty. This newspaper reported on this previously. Yu was not satisfied and appealed to the local court of the same court because it was a preliminary case. The court specially convened a collegial panel, headed by Judge Xu Jiashi and including Judges Ge and Sun. Wu and the two Wangs were brought to court and all claimed that they earned a living by fortune-telling. The Chai brothers stated that although their father was an astrologer, they had taken up other occupations since his death and that the two Wangs were their father's students, with no other relationship. Yu stated that he passed by Tibet Road and saw many astrology shops. Thinking that these people were dedicated to deceiving the public and should be punished, he entered Chai Wenzhong's fortune-telling shop, where Cai Fa greeted him. He told him that he wanted a fortune told, and Cai Fa said that he needed to pay a registration fee of six jiao first, which he paid. Cai Fa gave him a receipt. Wang Yonghai then told his fortune, and when Yu asked about a friend's illness, Yonghai said the divination was very ominous and that he needed to perform a ritual to ward off the bad luck, which would take two days and cost 176 yuan. He also gave him a bill. Wang Yonghai stated that because the divination was ominous, Yu asked if there was a way to resolve it. He replied that it was possible and asked Yu how much money he would need. He stated between forty to fifty yuan a day, totaling one hundred yuan for two days. Yu then asked him to add an introduction fee of sixty yuan and transportation costs of sixteen yuan to the bill, which is why the bill was for 176 yuan. Yu denied asking Yonghai to add an introduction fee and transportation costs. Wu Jianguang and the others then successively testified, and their statements were similar to those at the initial trial. After the testimony, the lawyers for both sides debated. The court ordered that a judgment be announced on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case of the Murdered Daughter-in-Law of Constable Li Qingfu</h3>
<p>Li and Chen's Statements Continued Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Qingfu Still Threatens People</p>
<p>Li Qingfu, a native of Anhui, was a Chinese constable No. 615 at the Gordon Road Police Station. He lived with his wife, Chen, his eldest son, Yu Long, and his second son, Yu Kun, at No. 660 Gordon Road. On the evening of the 27th of last month, they allegedly strangled his daughter-in-law, Zhang (Yu Long's wife), to death. The case was investigated by Chinese Detective Shao Jingfan of the police station, who arrested Li Qingfu and the other three and sent them to the Shanghai Special District Court. Except for Li Chen, who fainted in court during questioning and was sent to the hospital for treatment and therefore was not questioned, Li Qingfu and the other two had been questioned and ordered to be held for further investigation. This newspaper has reported on this three times previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi took his seat in the Second Criminal Court to continue the hearing. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police stated that since the last court hearing, the police had conducted a detailed investigation and discovered new evidence. Since Zhang died suddenly in the middle of the night on August 27th, the third defendant, Li Yu Kun, went out on September 1st to look for a house to move into. He rented the remaining rooms of Zhou Wenhua's house at No. 87 Mingyuanfang, Huade Road, and paid a deposit of one yuan. The next day, Li Chen and Li Yu Long also went to see the house and moved two trunks there. The detectives opened the two trunks, one of which was empty and the other full of the deceased's clothes. Also, on September 5th, a train ticket was found on Yu Kun. This situation is suspicious. However, Zhou Wenhua, the second landlord of Huade Road, was asked to testify in court, but he did not arrive today. Detective Shao Jingfan complained that according to the defendant Li Qingfu, after his daughter-in-law died, he pawned her clothes the next day to prepare a coffin, but the pawnshop said that Li pawned the clothes on September 2nd, not on August 28th. Another point is that when the defendant Li Chen rented the house on Huade Road, she borrowed the living room from the second landlord and falsely claimed that her brother had recently died of illness and that the first seven days of mourning had passed and that she wanted to do the second seven days of mourning. The landlord agreed. This fact can be proven when the second landlord, Zhou Wenhua, arrives at court next time. The Judge Wu then questioned Li Chen, who stated that she lived at 666 Gordon Road with three families. Her daughter-in-law, Zhang, lived in the pavilion room upstairs. On the evening of the 27th of last month, at around 7:00 PM, she and her daughter-in-law had a quarrel during dinner, and she scolded her. After a neighbor persuaded them to reconcile, her daughter-in-law went upstairs to take a bath. She was cooling off at the door. About half an hour after she went to sleep, she heard a thud upstairs. She went upstairs to check and saw her daughter-in-law hanging herself on the door with a cloth she usually used to bind her feet. The thud was the sound of the small stool she was standing on when she hanged herself falling over. She quickly tried to save her and helped her onto the bed. At that time, she was still breathing but could not speak. She then massaged her. Her husband also heard the sound and asked what was happening upstairs. She falsely said that her daughter-in-law had a heatstroke. Her husband went out to look for someone to scrape her back and buy heatstroke medicine. After a while, she saw that her daughter-in-law's breath was getting shorter and she died at dawn. Because her daughter-in-law's suicide occurred after her quarrel with her, she was afraid of being blamed, so she claimed that she had heatstroke. This is the truth and there are no lies. Judge Wu asked her about the marks on the deceased's upper and lower teeth and two teeth fell out, and there was a purple-black mark under her tongue and a mark on her right shoulder and had marks, and if she claimed that her daughter-in-law had hanged herself, where did these injuries come from? She replied that she did not know and that she had never beaten her daughter-in-law before and asked for a clear judgment. Li Qingfu, Li Yu Long, Li Yu Kun, and the witness, Ms. Pan Wu, successively testified. Their testimonies were the same as the last time and have been reported in the newspaper, so they will not be repeated here. However, Ms. Pan Wu only stated that when the defendant Li Qingfu was detained in the waiting room today, he said to her through a small hole in the door that she should not incriminate him when she testified in court, implying a threat. She was very afraid because she was afraid that he would seek revenge on her after he was released from prison. Judge Wu reviewed the testimonies and, seeing that the witness Zhou Wenzhang had not arrived, ordered the four defendants to be detained separately and to continue the hearing on the afternoon of September 25.</p>
<h3>Misfortunes Never Come Singly; Zhu Mintang Arrested</h3>
<p>The Color Ticket Scheme of Guanghua Company</p>
<p>Zhu Mintang Involved in Criminal Case</p>
<p>Although Zhu Xiangjie, aka Zhu Mintang, has been personally negotiating with Zhao Xiuzhen in the case of inducing sexual relations by Zhao Xiuzhen, the result of repeated face-to-face negotiations to recover the spilled water and withdraw the private prosecution, the issue of lawyer's fees has been raised separately. After Zhang Chongding, a lawyer, repeatedly urged Zhao to fulfill his agreement to pay the attorney's fees, Zhao stated that although the matter had been settled amicably, the attorney's fees should be borne by Zhu. The two sides negotiated for several days until a compromise was reached for an attorney's fee of 300 yuan, but it had to be delayed for a few days. However, one wave was not over and another wave rose. The French Concession Guanghua Silver Company's criminal involvement in the color ticket matter involved Zhu Mintang. Zhu was taken away by detectives from the French police, and Zhu's family was running around trying to rescue him. At the same time, someone accused him of issuing a bad check from a certain bank for more than 1,070 yuan, which was returned upon maturity and unpaid. The French Court has reportedly issued a warrant for his arrest and detention.</p>
<h3>Case of Unpaid Rent for Five Days</h3>
<p>Hardoon Sues Guan Wuzhou</p>
<p>Judge Luo of the Seventh Court of the Special District Court recently heard a case of a foreign landlord oppressing a tenant. The lawyers for both sides debated for two hours. The audience paid close attention to the case. The houses at Nos. 243 and 244 Shandong Road, Block D, are the property of Hardoon Company and have been rented to Fan Tongsheng for the Guan Wuzhou Hat Shop for a monthly rent of 149 taels of silver, which has always been calculated according to the lunar calendar. Although the tenant requested that the calculation be changed to the solar calendar, the foreign company did not comply with current laws and regulations. Recently, the hat shop has been in a slump and has been closed for liquidation, and a takeover person has been found and a takeover price of 4,000 taels has been agreed upon, but it has not yet been completed. Unexpectedly, Hardoon Company posted a printed notice on the door of the house stating that the house was being taken back for rent, causing the takeover person to dare not take over. Hardoon Company's manager, Shen Licheng, sued in the Special District Court for two months of rent owed, totaling 298 taels of silver, claiming that it was rent owed for August and September according to the solar calendar. Judge Luo summoned the plaintiff and the defendant to court for a hearing. The plaintiff, Hardoon's manager Shen Licheng, arrived at court with lawyer Ye Fukang, and the defendant was fully represented by lawyer Zhu Xiyun. The plaintiff argued that he demanded to recover the rent for August and September and said that the posting of the rental notice was requested by the defendant. The defendant's lawyer argued that the plaintiff had always collected rent according to the lunar calendar and presented a letter from the plaintiff demanding rent for the leap June, which was sufficient to prove that it was undoubtedly the lunar calendar. Now, he is suing for rent owed for August and September to avoid violating the National Government's regulations that all rents should be calculated according to the solar calendar. However, if calculated according to the solar calendar, twenty-one days should be deducted, or at least nine days should be deducted. The plaintiff posted a rental notice on August 14, indicating that he would take back the house. According to this date, nine days should be deducted and only five days of rent are owed. Since the plaintiff posted a rental notice on the shop door, the defendant's already agreed-upon takeover had been canceled, causing significant losses (this matter will be reserved for further discussion). The landlord's oppression of the tenant forced the defendant to entrust the items in the shop to Yizhong Auction, but the plaintiff came out to stop him when he was removing the items. So he went to the General Police Station. The case has been accepted by the court and is awaiting court proceedings. The plaintiff's successive oppressions have forced the defendant to a dead end. The plaintiff's rent for August and September should be calculated according to the plaintiff's calculations for rent not yet lived in. How can he sue for it in advance? Today is the 15th, but the lawsuit was filed before the 15th. I am afraid there is no such reason in the world. Therefore, I request that the plaintiff's request be rejected. The plaintiff continued to say that the rent was paid in advance and there was a rent ticket stipulation. The defendant's lawyer said that this rent ticket was the standard of the landlord's oppression of the tenant. How could the tenant request a change? In short, he only owed five days of rent and wanted to sue for it. Is this not oppression? As a result, Judge Luo ordered an attempt at reconciliation. If it was unsuccessful, a judgment would be scheduled for a later date.</p>
<h3>Red Pills More Harmful Than Opium</h3>
<p>French Police Find Three More Cases</p>
<p>Because red pills are more harmful than opium, the French Concession authorities have instructed all detectives to strictly investigate and arrest those involved. The French police detectives recently discovered that Jiang Wenqing's house at No. 36 Deshan Lane on Avenue Dubail, the house of a woman named Chen Lao San at No. 28 in the same lane, and the house of Cao Wang at No. 183 Caishi Street, etc., had privately set up lighting to provide poor people to eat red pills inside and violated the prohibition, so they went to each place and seized the lighting and a number of red pills, brought them to the police station and ordered them to provide bail. Yesterday, they were summoned to the French Court to be investigated. First, the Western detective chief reported the previous situation and questioned the defendants, who admitted to privately selling red pills for people to eat under the lights. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced the three defendants to a fine of 200 yuan each and confiscated the items as a warning.</p>
<p>Lou Kenzai Kidnapping Case</p>
<h3>Accomplice Du A'ge Apprehended</h3>
<p>Lou Kenzai, the seventeen-year-old son of Lou Xunru, the president of the Qungong Bank, was studying at Qianye School on Peng Road. On the morning of November 4th last year, Kenzai was kidnapped by bandits on his way to school from his residence at No. 12 Mendelan Road. His family redeemed him for 10,000 yuan. Detective Wang Debiao of the Huishi Police Station arrested two kidnappers, Zhou Kui and Fan Xibo, who were interrogated and sentenced to death by shooting according to law. However, accomplice Du A'ge, also known as Du Pinxiang, from Tongzhou, escaped after the incident and disappeared. After an investigation, it was learned that the bandit was hiding in the house at No. 37 Kaifeng Road. The Chinese and Western detectives Zhu A'san, Wang Jinshou, and Wei Linsheng of the Huishi Police Station secretly went there and arrested Du on the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday, he was sent to the Shanghai Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi questioned him. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police stated that the police still needed to investigate everything about the bandit and requested a postponement. Judge Wu questioned the bandit Du briefly and ordered him to be detained and rescheduled for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Preventing Theft</h3>
<p>Shops Must Pay Attention</p>
<p>Police Authorities' Opinion</p>
<p>Recently, there have been increasing reports of theft and impersonation of goods, which has attracted attention from all sectors. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, the police authorities alone are not enough to achieve results without the assistance of various shops. All shop owners and managers should be especially careful and pay attention when unfamiliar customers ask to be billed or claim that they will have the goods delivered to a certain place to collect the money. There are also thieves who take the opportunity to steal things during transactions. They go to the store pretending to buy goods, picking and choosing harshly, so that the shop assistants are distracted and unable to pay attention, and then use their skills to hide valuable items on their bodies and leave. Shop assistants should also pay attention to this situation at all times.</p>
<h3>Founding of the Charity Property Organization Committee</h3>

Then chairman Committee member Feng Liutang gave a reply speech, concluded the ceremony and dispersed. The committee held its first standing meeting yesterday to discuss the rules of procedure, detailed rules of procedure, and various tasks and organizational cases.</p>
<p>Labor Hospital</p>
<h3>The Epidemic Department Continues to Provide Consultations and Medication as Usual</h3>
<p>The Epidemic Has Not Been Eliminated and The End Date Postponed</p>
<p>Since its opening in early July, the Shanghai Labor Hospital Epidemic Department has provided countless consultations and medications. Because the epidemic has decreased the fifteenth of this month was the intended closing date, but since the beginning of autumn, more than ten cases of cholera have been discovered in the city. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter requesting this condition, as the department's duty is to provide relief to workers suffering from epidemics. Given that the bacteria has not been completely eliminated, the responsibility cannot be easily shirked. Department Director Li Runxiang, after consulting with Hospital Affairs Committee Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Vice Presidents Wang Jingyang and Wei Shouyuan, decided to postpone the closing date in order to better cope with the situation and maintain the health of the workers.</p>
<h3>The Murder of the Chinese and Foreign Engineer Case</h3>
<p>The Defendant Changed His Testimony at Yesterday's Trial</p>
<p>Witness Testimony Awaits Adjourned Trial</p>
<p>On May 30th of this year, Chinese and foreign engineers of the Dredging Bureau distributed wages on the Lifly steamer at Yangshupu when bandits robbed more than 2,000 yuan and shot and killed the engineers. The Xinzha Police Station arrested the defendants Zhang Gengshi, Feng Qing, and Yao Zucheng, and sent them to the Shanghai Local Court. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zhen opened the court. The defendants all changed their testimonies, denying the claims and claiming that the testimonies they previously gave at the police station were obtained through torture. The judge then questioned Xu Zheng, A'zhang, and Shen A'jiang, who stated that they ran small motorboats at the Huangpu Steamboat Bureau. On that day, two people came to hire their boat and agreed on a fare of three yuan. They first sailed to the Taidong Wharf and stopped. Then eight or nine people came down. At that time, one of the people who hired the boat was Zhang Genfu, and Feng Qing was also among the people who later came to the boat, but Yao Zucheng was not seen. After about half an hour, they were ordered to sail to the Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu and then to the Huangpu Wharf. They went to the Lifly steamer. They ordered them to sail the two people on their ship to Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. The official said that he still needed to summon witnesses and ordered the defendants to be held for further trial.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Tiantong Road</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 PM on the previous evening, three robbers speaking with a Jiangbei accent broke into No. 5 Tiantong Road, Hongkou. All had handguns. One person stood guard at the door while two broke into the upstairs, forbidding anyone to make a sound, overturned boxes and cabinets, and searched at will. Gold jewelry and clothing were stolen, estimated to be worth about 796 yuan. The robbers left with the loot. The robbers fired a shot as they left, but fortunately no one was injured. The victim reported the incident to the police station and requested that they be apprehended.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Refugees Passing Through Hongqiao Town</h3>
<p>Three Hundred and Eighty Men, Women, and Children</p>
<p>At around 2:00 PM on the previous afternoon, three hundred and eighty refugees, men, women, and children from Xinhu, Hunan, led by Tan Zhiqin and Fang Yusheng, arrived at Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai from QibaTown, Songjiang. After arriving at the town, they extorted supplies from the local community. Fortunately, Pan Xuezeng, the chief of the Sixth District First Branch Police Station, learned of this and led the police to maintain order and guide them to settle down in nearby places such as the Anguo Temple Lianchang Temple, so the merchants did not suffer any losses. He immediately reported to the Beixinjing Town Sixth District First Branch Police Station. The head of the station, Wang Xixiang, and Inspector Li Cunzheng supervised the entire armed police force to suppress them and stated that this was the jurisdiction of the urban area and they were not allowed to stay here to avoid causing trouble. Then the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to allocate more than one hundred dollars, and yesterday morning the entire group set off to the northwest toward the Jiwang Temple.</p>
<h3>Banning Russian Beggars</h3>
<p>Ordering the Districts in the City to Immediately Expel Them</p>
<p>Recently, several Russian beggars have often appeared in front of the Small World gate in the city, forming gangs, dressed in rags, and with ferocious faces, blocking our young women and forcibly begging. The police on duty ignore them and do not interfere. Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was informed.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Having learned that these Russian beggars had previously engaged in forcibly pulling passers-by and committing violence in the Qujiang Road area of Zhabei, an order had been issued to strictly ban them. Unexpectedly, they recently dared to run rampant in the downtown area, and the police did not stop them, allowing them to forcibly beg and extort money, which was extremely inappropriate. Yesterday, he strictly ordered the district offices in charge to instruct the police on duty to immediately expel these Russian beggars if they were encountered. Those who disobey will be detained and sent to Russian charitable organizations for care to avoid causing trouble and ensure public safety.</p>

Of this amount, 1,000 yuan was guaranteed by a certain gentleman, and the remaining 2,000 yuan was secured by a Ford car, with an agreement to return the car upon repayment. However, the defendant repeatedly delayed and ignored the obligation. Furthermore, the car was repossessed by the car dealership due to the defendant's failure to pay the purchase price. The plaintiff contends that the defendant's actions constitute fraud and requests an investigation, prosecution, and appropriate punishment.  Hu admitted to owing the money but claimed to be temporarily unable to repay it and requested an extension. Judge Zhu, presiding over the case, ordered the defendant to provide bail and settle the matter within seven days.</p>

<p>Zhabei Unions: Declaration regarding the Tiancheng Silk Weaving Factory's suspension of raw material supply, hindering work: The Tiancheng Silk Weaving Factory, while strengthening union efforts to develop production, is forcibly reducing wages, suspending the supply of raw materials, and dismantling machinery, cutting off workers' livelihoods. Our unions have repeatedly received appeals for assistance from Tiancheng Union representatives and must provide sympathetic support. Since its establishment in 1925, Tiancheng Factory has grown from eight to forty-five machines, with annual profits reaching hundreds of thousands of yuan. Its rayon fabrics can be said to be at their peak today. However, the factory is not considering production progress and is forcibly reducing workers' wages and suspending the supply of raw materials, making it impossible for workers to work. It is also dismantling machinery and adding hundreds of foreign machines, causing the factory's workers no peace. The factory's wages are based on piecework, with a price of 42 cents per foot. Now the factory is forcing the union to reduce this to 28 cents, while the workers are willing to reduce it to 38 cents. After arbitration by the authorities, the price was set at 33 cents, but the factory has since suspended the supply of raw materials, dismantled machinery, and added foreign machines to implement a wage reduction plan. Fortunately, the workers have recognized the factory's scheme and have collectively resisted its implementation. Given the actions of the Tiancheng Factory's management, our unions, as part of the same front, deeply hate the factory's authorities. In addition to jointly submitting a petition to the Party and government authorities for prompt action and being willing to support the Tiancheng Union, we urge all Shanghai workers to pay attention to prevent other factories from imitating these actions. This declaration is jointly issued by the Shanghai Commercial Press Union, the Huayang Printing Union, the Huashang Public Bus Workers' Union, the Huazhuang Binding Zhabei District Union, the Jingyi Niushang Leather Factory Union, the Western Clothing Union, the Tea Box Union, the General Affairs Office Staff Union, the Zhabei Cleaning Workers' Union, the Coal and Wood Workers' Union, the British-owned Zilai Yanxing Union, the Wenwei Union, the Huayang Cloth Industry Staff Union, the Lithographic Gum Paper Union, the Bristle Union, the Tea Processing Union, the Zhufeng Union, the Eighth Silk Factory Business Union, and others.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>In this morning's edition of your newspaper, under the local news section, an article titled "Wife of a Sailor" mentions "[actually took a fancy to Hu Yongkang, who was selling Jakelin medicine on the road]". After investigation, Hu Yongkang is not an employee of our company, nor is he a seller of Jakelin medicine. Even if he were selling Jakelin medicine, it would certainly be counterfeit medicine, as such counterfeit medicines are rampant in the market. Therefore, we kindly request a correction.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Journey (1)</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>Traveling North in Flying Snow</p>
<p>The tender light of the winter morning caresses Shanghai, still asleep. Our car, splashing the snow accumulated last night, speeds past the bustling workers and heads towards the river. In that instant, I bid farewell to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Having been tossed around by fate for years, this journey north is also at the mercy of fate. Although I am not one to succumb to fate.</p>
<p>Almost a month ago, I received two letters summoning me to the north. Due to past hunger, suffering, and unfortunate circumstances, even though I am about to drift to the far outside the pass, and that area is close to the terrifying Sino-Russian War zone, I have made this decision to brave danger and embark on a long journey for the sake of hope and longing.</p>
<p>Later, the biggest reason that prevented me from going from Shanghai to Harbin was the 100 yuan needed for travel expenses. I could not find a way to raise this terrible amount.</p>
<p>I thought I could not realize the northern journey. I went to Nanjing to look for a job, but a airmail letter drove me back to Shanghai again. It turned out that a friend who was returning north invited me to travel with him and lent me travel expenses.</p>
<p>It seems that fate has destined me. I am fighting against fate.</p>
<p>Ling, you should go to the north. This is a great opportunity for you to create for yourself. You must not miss this opportunity. Your continuous sorrow in the south has caused great losses to you..."" my friends told me.</p>
<p>Yes, I am thinking like that and determined to go north. Although I can't predict what the phenomenon will be after going north, it is a very happy thing that I can get a chance to travel this time. There are black forests and empty deserts in the north. The mountains are permanently white, and snow is flying in the sky all year round... These will give my soul infinite great feelings, and there, I can better than in the south. Closer opportunities to observe the red Russ rampant looting and all brutal circumstances on our nation..."</p>
<p>This time, I am on the road of the Long March. When people spend this shivering end of winter around the stove, I am marching to the cold zone and to the north where the snow is flying all year round.</p>
<p>I left Xie Jun and Luo Jun's hands silently and stood on the sampan. After another humming gong, the engine started to sound and the ship body gradually left the dock.</p>
<h3>Wandering in the Embrace of Nature</h3>
<p>— Hua She</p>
<p>Goodbye Shanghai, goodbye the friends at the Bund, goodbye...</p>
<p>The crowd on the dock gradually blurred in my sight. Shanghai gradually left him far away. I pulled Chen Jun (a friend who was traveling with me) and walked back to the cabin silently, gazing at the two pieces that had been with me in the south for several years. Lived in broken luggage.</p>
<p>The expedition began. I want to take you to the outside of the Great Wall, where there are no fallen peach petals that have been blown by the south wind will fall on your back. There is snow flying all year round.</p>
