<p>近數年來歐陸各國因經濟日趨於衰敗而謀所以合作議設經濟同盟者久矣前之關稅會議即此經濟同盟之先聲也白里安之歐洲聯邦計劃其重要目的亦即在經濟同盟今國際聯盟會議中又羣以速立關稅同盟爲望其名雖異而實皆不外以經濟合作抵禦勁敵而已前此美國頒布新稅則歐人曾一度奮興督促關稅同盟之速成今俄國以農産品賤售操縱各國市塲歐人又將奮起以促關稅同盟之速成世界經濟之大戰爭殆將由斯而開始歟</p>

<p>兩船均受傷</p>
<p>祥泰已入塢</p>
<p>招商局長江船江新輪於滬運貨赴漢行至吳淞口被英輪祥泰號碰撞損壞船身外舷而祥泰頭部則受重創兹將此事詳情查記如下</p>
<p>碰撞情形招商局江新輪於二十三日晨離滬上駛至吳淞口時正值上午九時許循依航道開駛出口而祥泰洋行長江班輪祥泰號係由漢口下水來滬至吳淞口内兩船相值行入一綫其時早潮方漲該處水流湍急江新輪見祥泰</p>
<p>輪直向左側而行不意水急潮巨祥泰輪於轉瞬間已迎面撞來江新輪立打倒車幸趨避較捷正面未被撞碰而右舷外已遭祥泰輪船頭猛撞一下鐵板破壞船身受損矣</p>
<p>損壞狀况查江新輪載重較祥泰爲巨船身鋼板亦較祥泰爲堅當祥泰輪猛撞之際幸江新乘倒車之退讓故外舷損壞處在水平綫以上無妨行駛至祥泰輪在撞碰江新之時以潮激不能制止船主賴奇斯亦打倒車但卒不能免碰擊兩輪均係重儎當塲祥泰之船頭部毁壞甚巨鐵板亦破不能行駛幸旅客船員均已起身故未傷人嗣後祥泰則拖靠碼頭江新仍離開上海</p>
<p>修理消息江新輪以班期攸關損壞在吃水綫以上故仍赴漢其撞損處命在船工人隨行隨修以俟下班還滬時騐勘後再行修理至於祥泰輪即行拖泊碼頭將船内來貨赶卸上棧由船主報告海關及滬行騐明船頭毁壞情形後昨日午刻已由小火輪拖入瑞鎔廠大修矣至於兩船相撞之責任問題雙方須實地調查後再行交小</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>南滿路與中東路</p>
<p>清晨我們上了南滿車繼續北行</p>
<p>南滿車的構造很漂亮三等車廂可與京滬車二等車比</p>
<p>從車窗往外一看景色自然是北方的風光了積着雪的山野一叢一叢灰色的空林小河冰着一座一座矮小的土屋屋頂嬝着黄色的烟……完全呈現出寂靜而慘淡的情調頗像一隻中世紀遺留下的古獸僅僅在微微地嘆息着啊</p>
<p>尤其是那些矮小的土屋的奇特那型像好像我們所乘的車廂稍稍弧形的屋蓋周圍完全用土泥成透着很小的窗洞從屋頂吐出烟因爲裏面燒着火坑由這些如陳列着一個一個的中國式的棺材一樣的土屋我們可以想到關外鄉村民衆生活的簡陋了</p>
<p>車經過撫順　從車窗我們能夠看到這關外的都市的一個糢糊的輪廓似乎房屋无全是土紅的顔色在全部的城市的上面充着迷濛的黄烟</p>
<p>在夜晚車到長春了由陳君的領導在車站附的的一家客棧住下這客棧在長春也算很有名了但裏面一點也不能使旅客們舒適不也許我不習慣北方的生活的原故吧當你走進屋内去裏面便有多量的水蒸汽湧出那會把你悶得不容易呼吸好像走進了公共浴池</p>
<p>我們在一張很大的坑（？）上憩下那坑已經進化了不燒火而用熱水管</p>
<p>這旅館裏的人們眞太客氣從茶房堂役一直到老板經理（北方人呌掌櫃的）甚至老板娘都要一一的來問我們的好眞把我弄得應接不暇了但我覺得這類虚僞的客氣對於旅客只有無益的攪擾</p>
<p>從長春到哈爾濱的最後一段路是我一個人獨行了</p>
<p>中東路車顯然同南滿路車是一個粗重與一個精小的對照汽笛發出一聲刺耳的怪呌之後笨重的車身蠕動了在靜冷的夜氣中更加地顯得車身震響的沉重有如一隻龐大而線長的魔怪在黑夜巡行</p>
<p>我一上車就躺着也不知道車開到了什麽地方我就入夢了雖然車身是不住地震動着</p>
<h3 id="c260">還鄉 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 黛</p>
<p>從這次重返故鄉的經歷中使我確切地深信故鄉還依然在荒凉悽慘的狀態中</p>
<p>我想象這七載的闊别或許會給故鄉以改進的機遇於是故人從遠方歸來燦爛地呈出光明的景象一切都會如朝日之初昇但是失望了在高低不平的崎嶇路上我茫茫然瞻顧四週没有一處有動人的建築更没有一處有新鮮的創設我想這是七載離别後的故鄉嗎本來從旁面底觀察我已明瞭故鄉並無何種改進</p>
<p>人依舊是人我遇到了不少故親他們是熱烈的歡迎我</p>
<p>「多麽奇怪喲喂遠來的客人」於是我便被他們包圍在一處他們問我這樣又問我那樣我幾乎有應接不暇之勢了自然在我寂寞的環境中添加了不少的熱閙和趣味然而我總有些討厭他們糾纒著有什麽作用呢這正表示故鄉人士之少見多怪</p>
<p>幾位年紀不很少的先生們他們赤著膞手裏揑著水烟管子靜靜地聽我講話有時也便加進來說一二句但不論如何他們臉上總充滿著驚奇的色彩與懷疑的態度似乎是贊成又似乎是反對</p>
<p>「這是有新鮮意味的過我們的年齡太高了」他們擠著鬍子說在我這是不覺得什麽的不過我於說話時確曾刻意地注意在我身旁包圍著幾位姑娘她們從來不曾與年紀彷彿的男性談過話或和男性在一處默坐我細細觀察他們雖然因爲我嚴重而大方的氣魄遏止了她們畏懼和羞恥的表演但仍時時露出不如意的態度</p>
<p>「她們爲什麽不想攫得應有的自由呢」我問</p>
<p>她們互相笑了一笑一這「個原因是我所不知道的」</p>
<p>其實也是出乎我的意料我還以爲這沿海的一個重要商埠數年來受新潮流的震蕩必然地會把舊式一切不利于兩性間的障礙消去但是不然她們告訴我本地的禮敎是怎樣嚴密女子怎樣不能有一上的行動權在一般眼光中見來兩性諦結正當的友誼是最無人格最可恥的事</p>
<p>我曾跑進了一個人家主人是我義兄這個屋子我一見之後理大吃一驚因爲經年不修殘敗而頽廢的景象正暗示未來底不安没有一處是比較完整些破毁了而且傾斜這小上的屋子住了五家一個不像樣的客廳只有兩張不完全的桌子早晨中午晚間的餐食必然一家家輪流孩子是多極了一歲至四五歲的最多赤裸着整日號哭變成一個哭聲的世界男主人瘦得如一根柴有些不得意便把小孩痛打於是哭聲愈弄愈大了女人比較好些但一種疲乏不堪的表示顯露出她們毫没有一些振作的精神</p>
<p>這是一個慘淡的世界街路上除去一二聲小販的呼喊外沉沉如靜睡一般全縣市民恍如在夢中他們迷朦著雙眼雖然有强烈的刺激但是無用一直沉睡著老年是過去了他們自已承認已經逹到墳墓的時候不必再來作一番麻煩的工作中年者套了老年的話以爲在少年時代没有充分的涵養過暫時逍遥罷中來的少年他們只曉得在黑暗的地獄來鑽動前面開闢着莊康的大道他們認爲是蛇毒之所而不屑向前移動一步</p>
<p>「没有人出來負改造的責任嗎」我問表姊</p>
<p>「這不是表面問題」表姊回答「假如你一觀察僅僅是形或上的頽廢那麽很容易設法但這個古怪的社會似乎毒汁已流入衆人的肉體内頑固的頭腦驅使他們毎天只在簡陋的生活中討求安全他們情願這樣是的懶惰性深入後是無法補救的於是你用新的理論去灌輸時結果只是莫名其妙」</p>
<p>表姊的話是對的我在悽愴的街道上徬徨了十餘天毎天望若殘敗的屋宇和茫無頭緒的人羣他們會喊</p>
<p>「喂遠來的客人好嗎託福我們都無恙」</p>
<p>但是遠來的客人悲傷地彈出他的弦琴</p>
<p>朝日朝西方去了這海</p>
<p>獪如我寄駐時地展闊</p>
<p>歡迎啊船上的旅子</p>
<p>失望着故鄉永更改</p>
<p>淪入沉夢中的精神渙衰</p>
<p>你荒坵也曾經過七載</p>
<p>前時我望你你尙存神采</p>
<p>今朝默默地如悠久的屍骸</p>

<p>— 湯增敭</p>
<p>前鋒周報第十一｜三期</p>
<p>文藝批評的種類甚夥因爲所批評的是從題材上的同和方法上的不同譬如從題材上作批評的起點處理史實的則呌作歷史批評處理科學上或哲學上的種種問題的則呌作科學批評或哲學批評文學批評（literycriticism）當然也不能出乎這個範圍之外不過它是用文學爲批評的題材這就是說是用文學的作品及問題爲對象的批評再若從方法上作批評的目標根據歷史底研究方法的則呌作歷史底批評根據科學上的原理及科學上的研究方法的則呌作科學底批評根據哲學上的原理及研究方法的當然呌作哲學底批評了關於此文學批評的方法及材料（Methods　andmateriaksofkiterarycriticism的著者蓋雷（Gayley）及斯各脫（Sootts）曾依照上述的那樣把從題材上作批評的觀點應用到文學的作品上來換一句話說即是用文學的作中及問題爲對象的批評則呌作文學批評（Literarycrit）tcism）但在方法上這「文學批評」又可以分爲兩種一是裁判的批評（judicialcritcism）一是歸納的批評（lnductivecriticism）在文學批評的派别上說當然還有許多種類這種文學批評的派别是隨着創作上的派别而産生的各種批評的方法有如古典主義（classicism）盛興的時期所謂因襲的批評（Tradtionlc</p>
<p>riticism）便適應着這作品而産生了其它的都可以根據此例來推想不用贅术由此足以能夠明白批評在某種文學産生的時候是不能缺乏而且它底重要在文學範疇也與其它的詩歌或小說是佔了同樣重要的位置近代文學論者說文學批評也是文學範疇上的一種這話在歐美各國的文藝理論已經確定是無别的文學根據而加以否認實際上文學批評還能輔助文學作品的展進這就要牽涉到文學批評底作者了</p>
<p>一個所屬民族的文藝盛興大部份的功效是依靠着文學批評家底鼓勵匡導「中國文藝之所以未能走上正確的軌道固然最大的原因是由於文藝作者之缺乏正確的中心意識但同時因於没有能把握住正確的中心意識的文藝批評家爲之匡導這也是顯然的事實」這樣看來文藝批評家是何等的重要尤其是在中國的文藝界最近在文藝思潮的突進中我們中國必然地産生了種民族主義的文藝在理論上它早已有確定的基礎是無有疑義的不過民族主義的文藝創作正在運生的時期當然要適應創作而産生的是民族主義的文藝批評家同時在批評的論斷須有一種正確的估量關於這一點襄華君的這篇「民族主義的文藝批評論」一文是發揮了深切的見解確立了文藝批評家的論斷民族主義的文藝創作底新方法也可以說是民族主義的文藝批評的水準值得分外注意的這文的産生對於民族主義的文藝創作是有絶大的影響依照這個批評法條來衡量作品的價值是可以使具有民族中心的創作得到突異的進展這是必然的事實</p>
<p>在「民族主義文藝批評底方法」裏作者說明了以往所産生的文藝批評的種類一在毎一種文藝批評的本質上來研究它底批評方法的標準以及它底紛歧雜亂的根由當然大都是屬於「互相排斥」的一類而各派的批評都没有完美的批評方法所缺乏中心的意識更其顯明在此作者將探討的結果發揮着一段正確的精密的論斷「我們所需要的首先是要能以民族主義文藝的原則來觀察創作進一上我們要把作品分柝出來是否是有利於民族或是有害於民族的同時更要顧到作品的時代與環境並注意它的形式的完美和内容的充實而下正確的判斷决不能忘却集圑的立塲而憑個人的趣味的評價爲轉移而階於以往的個人主義的文藝批評的覆轍」這便是民族主義的文藝批評的法原現代文藝批評家須根據這個法則來估民族主義的文藝創作的本身價值始不會所有歧誤</p>
<p>在此方法論之前作者是以精密的眼光檢探了「我們目前紛歧錯雜的中國文壇」同時又說明了在這種情形之下需要具有正確的中心意識的文藝批評家是更爲迫切在民族主義的文藝創作産生的時期正如聖柏夫（saintebeuve）所說「一個文藝創作家應有一個文藝批評家爲之匡導」民族主義的文藝創作家當然也是一樣其次解剖中國人之缺乏批評的精神與及歧誤的概念更是針針見血可算是極其高超的定論例如</p>
<p>本來中國人一向是缺乏批評精神的所以一切的進展也就異常的遲緩在文學方面批評尤不爲人重視我們倘從文學史上去追尋批評的遺骸有的無非是一般腐儒高唱的「文以載道」或是以道家的思想滲合起來鬧着「神」與「氣」的把戲所以簡直可以說中國一向便没有文藝批評家有的也不過是戕害文藝的劊子手</p>
<p>這是多麽可恥的事原來「文藝批評」這名詞在近年來才隨着新文藝的萌芽漸漸地有人提及其它關於批評家種種匡導的責任究竟負了没有所努力的成績又是怎樣我們是不言而知但在本文的作者也有詳盡的說明和指摘至於「民族主義文藝評底目的」一段也是依據斯各脫和蓋雷合著的「文學批評的方法及材料」一文所舉的關於一文藝批評底目」的綱領而應生出「民族主義的文藝批評底目的」計有九則亦即文藝批評的法條實可注意</p>
<p>最後是解說「民族主義文藝批評當前底任務」此叚非常重要現略引於下作者是依據「文藝批評底目的」所發揮出來的議論</p>
<p>民族主義文藝的當前任務是决不能忘記民族的民主精神絶對地擁護一般民衆的文藝創作要發展民族向上的意志排除一切阻碍民族進展的思想表現民族奮鬥底歷史在民族主義的文藝批評當中他必需把握住他的批評方法認清他的目的和使命對文藝作品加以嚴密的分析和判斷一切的封建思想頽廢思想和出世思想的作品與那爲蘇俄摇旗呐喊懷着欲亡中華民族的隂謀與那欲以階級意識來破壞民族意識的普羅作品應用全力去剷除同時是合乎我們民族主義的文藝批評的目的和使命的作品亦必盡力發楊尤其是對於新作品與新作家應以全力來扶助指示他們以正確的中心意識匡導他們向這方發展</p>
<p>這實是明確地斷定「民族主義文藝批評的當前的任務」誰也不能否認總之在建設民族主義文藝創作的現今像作者這樣不空泛的巨論是切迫地需要</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Repercussions of the Soviet Union's Sale of Agricultural Products at Reduced Prices <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The sale of Soviet agricultural products at reduced prices has not only attracted great attention from various European countries, but also has had an impact on the United States. American congressmen have even proposed banning the import of Russian wheat and other products. This shows that competition in the world market today is not only in industrial products, but also in agricultural products. Moreover, the methods of competition in the world market are becoming more sophisticated, the means are becoming more ruthless, and the measures for resisting and retaliating are becoming more intense. Agricultural products are more essential to people's daily lives than other manufactured goods, and they are also more urgent for national interests. Taking the European countries as an example, according to the current Austrian ambassador to Czechoslovakia, the emerging countries that were divided from Austria-Hungary are suffering the most from the pervasive global agricultural panic. Other agricultural countries are also fearing the decline of agriculture. Therefore, the agricultural problem today is serious. The Soviet Union suddenly used its forced labor policy to harvest huge amounts of grain and sell it at low prices in the markets of various European countries. The European countries, suffering from this great pressure, could not help but be shocked and eager to seek ways to resist and retaliate.</p>
<p>In recent years, European countries, due to the increasing economic decline, have sought to cooperate and discuss the establishment of an economic alliance for a long time. The previous tariff conference was the precursor to this economic alliance. The important purpose of Briand's European Federation plan was also to establish an economic alliance. Today, in the League of Nations conference, the rapid establishment of a customs union is also widely hoped for. Although the names are different, they are all aimed at resisting strong enemies through economic cooperation. Previously, when the United States promulgated new tariffs, Europeans once rose up and urged the rapid formation of a customs union. Now that Russia is manipulating the markets of various countries by selling agricultural products at low prices, Europeans will rise up again to promote the rapid formation of a customs union. The great economic war of the world is about to begin.</p>

Dr. Wu Chaochu, the Chinese representative, stated that China has not ratified the Geneva Opium Convention because it believes that this treaty is a regressive measure in some respects. Dr. Wu proposed that countries investigate this difficult problem within their own borders. Mrs. Hamilton, the British representative, said that if there were any meetings to limit drug manufacturing, the United Kingdom would be willing to cooperate, as this type of meeting is a practical first step towards solving this difficult problem.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Financial Committee Studies Gold Problem Report <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Reuter's, Geneva, 24th - The League of Nations Financial Committee's report on the gold problem states the impact of the world's decreasing gold production on various prices. It estimates that gold production this year is worth a total of 80 million British pounds. Gold production is decreasing year by year, and will decrease to 74 million pounds by 1940. The decrease will be even greater thereafter, as the South African gold mines are gradually being depleted. Although the low price of silver may lead to more purchases of cash, India does not need much gold due to the current economic depression, and China may use gold coinage due to the disadvantage of using silver. The report also states that if measures are not taken in time, serious events may occur in the future when trade recovers. The report welcomes domestic currency systems that do not use gold coins and advocates an international agreement to reduce the statutory minimum amount for preparing banknote exchange with a coordinated and stable currency policy. It also advocates that countries that have not yet consolidated their currency systems adopt the gold standard.</p>

<p>Inciting Armed Rebellion</p>
<p>Overthrowing the Current Constitution</p>
<p>Court Opens Hearing, Many Spectators</p>
<p>Party Leader to Testify</p>
<p>Reuter's, Leipzig, 23rd - The case of three junior army officers, Schlienger, Rudingen, and Wind, accused of disobeying orders from superiors and colluding with the National Socialist Party to incite lower-ranking officers to overthrow the current constitution through armed rebellion, opened today. There were many spectators, given the National Socialist Party's victory in this congressional election. The court was heavily guarded by police, and spectators had to be searched before being allowed to enter to prevent the carrying of weapons. It is estimated that 130 people were allowed into the audience. When the defendants entered the court, an army officer named Mengel shook hands with them, expressing great friendship. The audience was surprised. It is said that the defendants were able to select comrades to defend themselves because they were army officers. The defendant's lawyer was also Dr. Frank, a member of the National Socialist Party, who is also the legal advisor to the Socialist leader Hitler. The defendants paid respect to Frank with the party's salute. There were Communists and National Socialists among the spectators. The president of the court seriously warned the crowd not to take any demonstrations, saying that he would never allow the court to become a bear garden. The defendants did not plead guilty, saying that the junior army officers did not want to rebel, but had to make their superiors aware of the fact that young people in the army were dissatisfied with the government's actions under the pressure of the Treaty of Versailles. The court has approved the defendant's lawyer's request to summon Hitler to testify on Thursday.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 23rd - Reports say that the prosecutor has begun investigating, and it is expected that the results will lead to party leaders Hitler and Goebbels being accused of high treason.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Leipzig, 23rd - Three German army officers accused of attempting to organize cells of the National Socialist Party in the army and committing treason were tried in the Supreme Court today. It was decided to summon National Socialist Party leader Hitler to court to question his relationship with the defendants and the party's goals and methods. Hitler is expected to testify on Thursday.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 24th - Information has been obtained regarding the accusation of Hitler and Goebbels, leaders of the German Nationalist Party, which is about a thesis that appeared in a certain newspaper a year ago which was considered to damage military discipline.</p>

<p>National Forces Sufficient to Curb Rebellion</p>
<p>Financial Markets Already Affected</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - The German government issued a public statement this evening stating that representatives of several North American newspapers and news agencies repeatedly asked President Hindenburg to express his attitude towards the alarming news circulating in the country in recent days. Although the Prime Minister does not usually respond, he was authorized by President Hindenburg yesterday when he met with Prime Minister Brüning to declare that the President's opinion is completely consistent with the opinions expressed by the Prime Minister to people during successive talks after the election. He firmly believes that there is absolutely no danger of civil unrest in any part of the country. Even in the event of an accident, the troops under the jurisdiction of the government can easily restore law and order in the shortest possible time. The President also told the Prime Minister that he fully agreed with the Cabinet's determination to strive to carry out its reform program for the benefit and welfare of the country, so as to achieve successful results. The President relied solely on the clear consciousness of the people of the country. Although the country's internal and external affairs are in a very difficult situation, he deeply hoped that this major goal could be achieved under the organization of the current constitution.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - The financial market has been greatly affected by rumors following the election. Foreign currencies, especially the French franc, have been purchased one after another, and the amount is quite large. In order to stabilize the hearts of the European banking community, the National Bank has decided to transport gold to France and has recently stored it in the French National Bank.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Paris, 23rd - Young Plan exchange rates have fallen by about 13 percent. Yesterday, the Exchange Council here reiterated the words of the German Minister of Finance to calm the situation. The Minister issued a declaration on the occasion of the signing of the debt conditions set forth in the Young Plan, stating that the principal and interest of this debt and the special funds designated for the repayment plan are all related to German credit. The German government should unconditionally repay the bondholders. The Young Plan began to be implemented on May 17 of this year. Germany has taken the necessary measures to continue its implementation without interruption.</p>

<p>Caused by Soviet Dumping Manipulation</p>
<p>Farm Relief Plan Fails</p>
<p>U.S. Senators Prepare to Report Reconsideration Bills</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 23rd - The wheat market continues to decline. The House Committee on Soviet Propaganda and the Chicago Board of Trade are now preparing to investigate the claim of Soviet dumping manipulation and are scheduled to begin reviewing it tomorrow. It is reported that the first witnesses to be summoned are the managers of three brokerage firms that sold 7.5 million bushels of distant Russian wheat. Wall Street and the international banking community all say that this matter is the work of the Red Party. Business newspapers say that the government will find it difficult to explain the failure of its farm relief plan.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Chicago, 23rd - There was panic news today that the Canadian wheat merchant joint venture is currently in a difficult position. After this news was released, wheat prices fell further to the lowest price since 1906. The September wheat price was 77 and 7/8 per bushel.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 23rd - Senator Ward today declared here that he intends to submit a resolution to the next Congress prohibiting the import of several Soviet products, including tung, coal, forest materials, pulp, and wheat. Ward is also said to be planning to suggest prohibiting Russian merchants from making direct or indirect transactions in the U.S. wheat exchange. Ward's move is due to the recent sale of goods by the Soviet Union at reduced prices in the Chicago market, especially wheat. Recently, the U.S. authorities discussed prohibiting a batch of Soviet pulp from being imported because it was made through forced labor, but stopped due to a lack of evidence. Now, if Ward's bill is passed, any goods shipped by the Soviet Union will be banned and it will no longer be questioned whether they are the product of forced labor. Ward has extensive experience in U.S. natural resources, so he pays special attention to protecting the sales channels of U.S. products to counter Soviet competition. Reuter's, Chicago, 23rd - The president of the National Association of Capitalists expects that U.S. losses due to bankruptcy in 1930 may reach 100 million yuan. In the past few years, this loss has been 75 million yuan.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 23rd - The Austrian cabinet has been shaken for a long time, and it is expected that it will reach a critical period at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. However, friends of Prime Minister Scobel still believe that Scobel will be able to find a solution to safely overcome the difficult situation.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Vienna, 23rd - The government and various factions within the party have recently deviated from each other on personnel issues, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The cabinet assistant minister recommended the Minister of Railways to the Prime Minister and insisted on not yielding. If he does not obtain the position and resigns, the Minister of Agriculture will also inevitably follow suit due to party ties. According to a newspaper report, the Prime Minister will do everything possible to maintain the current political situation and will not resign until the assistant minister refuses to compromise. European newspapers expressed confidence in the Prime Minister, saying that being able to overcome this difficult situation, the results of the German elections have already disturbed people's hearts, and if the Austrian political situation changes again, the impact will be very serious.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Indian Situation Report <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd - The Indian government's report on the Indian situation for the week ending September 20 is the most interesting document on the Indian political situation. It is said that the general public has no doubt about the future outcome. The impression created by the propaganda of the National Congress is now rapidly dissipating. The significant losses suffered by Indians due to the boycott of foreign goods are now gradually causing the middle class to lose its sympathy for the National Congress. The trend of public opinion making the non-violent resistance movement ineffective is now more obvious. The National Congress's activities regarding the parliamentary elections are another clear demonstration of interference with individual rights. The National Congress is now planning to use people from the lowest class as candidates for the legislative bodies, with the goal of undermining the credibility of the legislative bodies, but this move has appropriately aroused the anxiety of ethnic minorities and strengthened their opposition to the National Congress. Although it cannot be said that the National Congress has exhausted its wisdom and strength, there is indeed reason to be optimistic about the future. However, the efforts of the authorities must not be relaxed.</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 23rd - The British government sent a dispatch to France protesting the French government's repayment of the principal and interest of French bond notes purchased by British people with paper francs, because they are only worth one-fifth of the gold franc. It also cited the precedent of the Hague Court ordering Brazil and Yugoslavia to repay the French who purchased bond notes at the price of gold coins. British newspapers attach great importance to this negotiation.</p>

<p>Casualties Estimated to be in the Hundreds</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Port of Ahur, 23rd - The storm continues. Many French fishing boats are drifting in the English Channel and French waters. The navy has dispatched eight light cruisers to rescue them. Although many ships have entered the port, many crew members have been swept away by the waves. A coastal ship has run aground off the coast of Scotland and sent out a distress signal. Lifeboats have been sent to rescue it. Another Belgian ship has also run aground, and another ship has sunk, but its crew members have been rescued.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 23rd - The losses of French fishing boats on the Atlantic coast during this storm are the greatest ever seen. Currently, there are still 500 missing, and casualties are estimated to be in the hundreds. Although torpedo boats are searching the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, progress is greatly hindered by the heavy fog. The French cabinet is now planning to allocate a large amount of money for relief.</p>

<p>Budget Preparation Becomes More Difficult</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - Army military and political reform was one of the ten political programs declared by the Minsei Party when it formed the cabinet. Now that a year has passed since the cabinet was formed, neither an investigation committee has been established nor any substantive plan has been obtained. Moreover, when the 1931 budget was being prepared, it was expected that revenue would decrease by 130 million yuan, and it was extremely difficult to fill the gap. Minister of Finance Inoue decided to uniformly reduce the established expenses of various ministries according to the rate of price decline, and also intended to require the army to save 20 to 30 million yuan in the established expenses of the budget. However, the Army Ministry has firmly refused. The government has not solved the difficulties with the navy, and has also had a disagreement with the army. It is worth noting that one wave has not subsided and another has risen again.</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Process of Liaoning and Zhang's Announcement of Circular Telegrams <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Two armies have been organized to take over defense of Peiping and Tientsin</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Some days ago, Zhang Xueliang, upon his return to Shenyang from Beidaihe, immediately telegraphed the leading figures of the northeastern provinces and regions, ordering them to gather in Shenyang within a limited time to attend a cadre meeting to discuss the policies for dealing with the current situation. This was because the Northeast's current position had implications of utmost importance both domestically and internationally. For several months, representatives from various parties had been traveling back and forth, causing much difficulty in dealing with them. Moreover, the floating public opinions and rumors fabricated by foreign newspapers were enough to affect social security. Therefore, in order to stabilize public sentiment and avoid the entanglement of lobbying representatives, it was decided to issue a circular telegram to express his attitude. On the 15th, leading figures from various provinces and regions, such as Zhang Zuoxiang, Tang Yulin, Wan Fulin, and Zhang Jinghui, had arrived at the Beiling Villa one after another. The cadre meeting was immediately convened to carefully study and discuss the matter. As a result, it was decided to adhere to the Dongdian (Eastern Telegram) proposal, calling on all parties to cease hostilities. The draft telegram was prepared by Wang Shuhan, the secretary-general of the Chief Executive's Office, on the 15th. For the sake of prudence, it was meticulously studied and revised until the 18th before it was decided to send it out. During this period, the draft telegram was once sent to the telegraph office on the 17th but was later withdrawn for delayed release. It was not until 7:30 AM on the 18th that it was sent to the telegraph office again and officially released (note that the text of the telegram has already been published in previous reports). Although this circular telegram was only sent on the 18th, the decision had been made several days earlier. Although the wording may have been revised, the general outline remained largely unchanged. The representative of Yan Xishan stationed in Shenyang received the news on the 15th and immediately telegraphed Yan, who then issued a telegram announcing his retirement. After the telegram was issued, representatives from the North, seeing that the Northeast authorities had made a clear statement, had no room to maneuver in staying in Shenyang. Kong Fanwei took the No. 102 train of the Beining Railway at 9:45 AM on the 18th to return to Peiping and then to Shijiazhuang. Jia Jingde and Xue Dubi also left Shenyang for the customs on the morning of the 19th. Currently, the Jin army in the Peiping and Tientsin areas has begun to withdraw. Due to the urging of various parties, the Northeast has decided to send troops to the customs immediately to peacefully take over the defense. The troops currently being prepared are organized into two army corps. The first army is commanded by Yu Xuezhong, the commander of Yuguan, and its subordinate units are the 23rd Infantry Brigade stationed in Yuguan (formerly Ma Tingfu's troops) and the 27th Brigade stationed in Lulong (Liu Naichang's troops), and the 1st Cavalry Division stationed in Liushouying (Zheng Zesheng's troops). The second army is commanded by Wang Shuchang, the director of the Military Affairs Department of the Border Defense Command, and its subordinate units are the 4th Brigade stationed in Xingcheng (Liu Yifei's troops), the 2nd Brigade stationed in Dahushan (Ding Xichun's troops), and the 25th Brigade stationed in Gaoqiao (Yao Dongfan's troops). In addition to the First Army Headquarters being organized at the discretion of Commander Yu Xuezhong, the organization of the Second Army Headquarters is entirely staffed by personnel transferred from the Border Defense Command. Chen Qinruo, the deputy director of the Military Affairs Department of the Border Defense Command, has been appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Second Army, and Wang Dexin, the chief of the First Section of the Military Affairs Department, has been appointed as the Director of the Staff Office. Liu Mingyun has been appointed as the Director of the Adjutant Office. Other military officers and adjutants of the army headquarters are being appointed and dispatched in succession in recent days. They will enter the customs in the coming days. As for the military station, which is related to the march of the army, the Sixth Section of the Border Defense Command has been tasked with the responsibility of preparing it. It has been decided that the general station will be located in Shanhaiguan, and the warehouse will be located in Huanggu Tun. Two sub-stations will be set up to accompany the first and second armies to handle the food and supplies for the personnel and horses. Wang Lie has been appointed as the chief of the general station, and Wen Runfang has been appointed as the deputy chief. They have started setting up the station since the 17th. Gao Jiyi, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, has been ordered to go to Shanhaiguan on the evening of the 18th to coordinate military transportation. The sale of tickets for the through train between Peiping and Shenyang has been suspended since the afternoon of the 19th, and only tickets to Leizhou are being sold. It is reported that Yu Xuezhong's troops have advanced towards Leizhou and will be waiting for orders in Junliangcheng. In the future, the first and second armies will take Peiping and Tientsin as their destinations. The first army will take over the defense of Peiping, and the second army will take over the defense of Tientsin. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Circumstances of the Northeast Sending Troops to Peiping and Tientsin <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Advocated an Early Decision in Beidaihe</p>
<p>The Reasons Why the Yan and Feng Factions Misunderstood Zhang's Telegram</p>
<p>Tientsin Correspondence: Since the Yan and Feng factions initiated the war, the conflict has lasted for six months. After Yan's defeat and return from the Jinpu Railway, he sought to replenish military funds by issuing banknotes of the Zhonghua National Bank on a large scale. Many merchants dared not accept them, and larger stores closed down on various pretexts. Recently, the banknotes of the Shanxi Provincial Bank have fallen to 60% of their face value, causing social and economic chaos. Therefore, the people of the North are extremely eager for a quick end to the war and place their hopes on Zhang Xueliang, who can sway the situation with a single move. In fact, Zhang Xueliang's policy and plan for using troops against the Yan and Feng factions had already been decided during his stay in Beidaihe. According to key members of Zhang's staff, the meetings after Zhang's return to Shenyang were merely discussions on the deployment of troops and the strategy of warfare. After Zhang Zuoxiang and others arrived, the entire plan for using troops was finalized. The 16th was the wedding day of Zhang Zuoxiang's son. While everyone in Shenyang was congratulating him, Zhang Xueliang personally drafted the mobilization plan and deployment orders, appointing Yu Xuezhong as the commander of the First Army, with the four mixed brigades under Liu Naichang, Yao Dongfan, Li Zhentang, and Zhao Zhixiang as the advance troops, and adding the two brigades under Liu Yifei and Dong Yingbin. Yu Xuezhong, the commander of the First Army to take over the defense of Peiping and Tientsin, was to have his troops embark on trains at Shanhaiguan and other defensive areas on the 19th, and occupy Tientsin by the early morning of the 21st. When this reporter drafted this letter, he thought that the army was already preparing. Gao Jiyi, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, personally coordinated the transportation of the troops. Several days ago, he secretly transferred vehicles from within the customs to outside the customs, assembling over 800 vehicles. It is said that 13 trains were used for Yu's troops to depart. Gao Jiyi has arrived in Shanhaiguan and is scheduled to come to Tientsin with the army. It is also reported that Wu Tiecheng, a representative of the Central Government, will also come to Tientsin with the army, while Zhang Qun will temporarily stay in Shenyang as the supervisor for Zhang Xueliang when he takes the post of deputy commander of the army, navy, and air force. After occupying Tientsin, Yu's army will simultaneously advance towards Peiping and recover the entire territory of Hebei. Zhang Xueliang also appointed Wang Shuchang as the commander of the Second Army and Hu Yukun as the commander of the Third Army. After Yu's troops occupy Peiping and Tientsin, he will order Wang and Hu to lead their troops into the customs and advance towards the Jinpu and Pinghan lines, with the aim of completely eliminating the Yan and Feng forces. It is said that the Yan army is now preparing to retreat.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's telegram arrived in Tientsin on the evening of the 18th and was initially detained by the Jin army. After reading it among themselves, they all thought that the wording was peaceful and did not contain any clear accusations against the Jin side. They all believed that Zhang was merely expressing his opinion on the current situation, similar to the nature of the Dongdian he issued in March. The next morning, it was distributed to various newspapers for publication. After receiving the telegram, a certain newspaper discussed it with the Jin side, who said that it could be published. Therefore, it was published in the newspaper on the 19th. It is said that the Jin side had always mistakenly believed that Zhang had a good impression of them and never expected that his telegram would be followed by the arrival of a powerful army. After Zhang's telegram arrived in Tientsin, the Peiping and Tientsin press simultaneously received a telegram from Yan, which roughly stated that the central air force had repeatedly dropped bombs and that he was willing to retreat in order to save the people's lives. This telegram came after Zhang's telegram, so it was generally concluded that it was a prelude to Yan's resignation. However, if Peiping and Tientsin were occupied by the Northeast Army, even if he wanted to resign, there would be no place for him to do so.</p>
<p>As for why the Yan and Feng factions had always believed that the Northeast would not resort to military force against them, there were two reasons: one was the subtlety of the Northeast's handling of the situation, and the other was the failure of the representatives of the Yan and Feng factions to ascertain the other party's true intentions. It is said that Jia Jingde and Xue Dubi were ordered to go to Shenyang, and it was not until the third day after their arrival that they were able to meet with Zhang. After meeting, they did not first inquire about Zhang's intentions, but instead ramblingly stated that Yan hoped that the Northeast would participate in the new government, and that Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Jinghui, and others could be given positions as government commissioners and ministers, with the number of positions to be decided by the Northeast. They tried to use the positions of commissioners and ministers as bait. Zhang listened with great displeasure and did not say a word in reply. Jia and Xue left without understanding his intentions. The second meeting was at Zhang's public banquet for representatives from various parties. Apart from polite conversation, no substantive matters were discussed. The last meeting was after Zhang issued the telegram. They merely explained the meaning of peace to them and asked them to report back to their masters. Therefore, they never understood Zhang's true intentions. (September 19)</p>

<p>Central Army to Cross the River and Pursue the Enemy Within Days</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The battle situation on the Longhai and Pinghan lines has taken a sharp turn for the worse in recent days. On the Jinpu Line, the enemy troops on the opposite bank of Luokou have also loaded supplies and ammunition onto trains and are transporting them to Dezhou in preparation for retreat. The Central Army will cross the river and pursue the enemy within two or three days. Han Fuju, the commander-in-chief of the First Army Corps, has sent Wei Jinglu, the captain of the second team of the first battalion of the second transportation corps, to expedite the transport of the materials originally unloaded from the Luokou Bridge from Nanjing, and has appointed Wei to be responsible for planning the repair of the bridge with Hu Shenghong, an engineer from the Jinpu Railway. Currently, the iron bridge materials have been transported to Yanzhou Station and will arrive in Jinan in the next day or two. It is reported that engineer Hu plans to request the Nanjing Railway Bureau to allocate more materials in addition to the materials that were originally unloaded, as it is not easy to find a solution for those destroyed by the Jin army. According to Mr. Hu, if the materials are available, the bridge can be repaired within two or three days. The Central Army's crossing of the river to pursue the enemy is expected to occur within three to five days. (September 22)</p>

<p>The Communist Party Still Attempts to Invade Nanxun</p>
<p>The 18th Division Advances from Tongwan to Suppress the Communists</p>
<p>All Sectors Petition the Central Government for Troops</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, Lin, and Li and their respective forces, under the orders of the Third International, intend to seize political power in Hunan and Jiangxi. However, since their defeat in Changsha, they have shown signs of fleeing towards Jiangxi. According to reliable military sources, the Communist bandits are fleeing into Jiangxi in two routes. Peng and Huang's bogus Fourth Army is entering the Zhutan Bridge area of Wanzai via Pingliu, only dozens of miles away from Wancheng. Zhu and Mao's bogus Third Army is heading towards Yuanzhou and Shanggao via Lizhuping (Xiang) and Lian (Hua), with the intention of advancing towards Nanxun. However, since the Communist bandits retreated into Hunan, this province has been closely guarded. Currently, there are four or five regiments of the 18th Division on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi. Brigade Commander Dai, believing that the mountainous terrain of Wanzai is not suitable for combat, has concentrated his troops in the Shanggao, Yuanzhou, and Gaoan areas to lure the bandits deep into the area so that they can be wiped out on the plains. All the strategic locations in Yuanzhou, Shanggao, and Gaoan have trenches and defensive fortifications. However, when the 104th Regiment withdrew from Wanzai, the residents, unable to stop them from leaving, cried bitterly and followed the army with their elderly and children. In addition to sending personnel to Wuhan to consult with Director He about the plan for attack and defense and requesting that the Fourth Army and the Gongluo Divisions enter Jiangxi to assist in the suppression of the bandits, the Ninth Army Headquarters is also continuing to carry out defensive works in the provincial capital. Temporary command posts have been set up for the outer trenches (outside the electrified fence) and earthworks near the provincial capital. Yu Zizun, the battalion commander of the 18th Division's engineering battalion, is responsible for the area west of Zhangjiang, including the Niuhang Station. Wang Ge, the chief of the First Section of the provincial government, is responsible for the earthworks in the old urban area east of Zhangjiang. Each household in the city is assigned two workers to rush to build day and night. More than twenty blockhouses are planned to be built near Nanchang, each three zhang high and four zhang long and four zhang wide, built with bricks and cement. Moreover, more than ten locations, including Shengmi (30 li from the province) upstream of the Gan River, Qilijie downstream, Niuhang Station on the Nanxun Road, and Liantang on the Nanzhang Highway, are also being contracted to build blockhouses, which can be completed soon. Once these blockhouses are completed, the firepower can reach more than 100 li. Even if the Communist bandits are cunning, they will not be able to succeed.</p>
<p>Some days ago, General Commander Lu received a large batch of bullets from the Nanjing General Headquarters and a map of the three provinces suppressing the bandits from the Wuhan Headquarters, which were successively distributed to various departments yesterday. At the same time, multiple copies of Zhu De's photo were printed and ordered to be strictly investigated by his subordinates. Due to the tense situation of Zhu and Mao fleeing to Jiangxi, all sectors in this province, in addition to the General Chamber of Commerce sending a telegram to General Commander Chiang requesting that the two brigades of the 50th Division on the front line be transferred back, the instructors of the industrial, commercial, and academic groups in this city also held a joint meeting at the city government on the 22nd to discuss ways to request troops. It was decided to send a telegram to General Commander Chiang and Director He requesting that several more divisions be dispatched to Jiangxi immediately to avoid repeating the mistakes of Hunan and causing the people to suffer. At the same time, they also telegraphed Liu Zhi and Xiong Shihui to request that they forward their request to the Central Government on their behalf to save the critical situation.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Yingqin, the director of the Wuhan Headquarters, recently received a telegram from the Central Government stating that the 104th Standing Committee of the Central Committee resolved that the Communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are rampant and that during this period of suppression, a propaganda brigade should be organized to expose the crimes of the Communist Party as much as possible. After receiving the order, Mr. He immediately began preparations and appointed Liu Guang as the brigade commander, ordering him to organize the brigade and set off for propaganda as soon as possible. Today (22nd), he started working in the Wuhan Military, Police, and Academic Research Association and will set off for Changsha and then Jiangxi to carry out his work. Today, the first brigade affairs meeting was held and several cases were decided. It has been learned that the organization and work plan of the brigade are as follows:</p>
<p>Organization Overview: The brigade is currently provisionally divided into three detachments, each with one detachment leader and seven propagandists. Wu Yue is the leader of the first detachment, Li Zhizhuo is the leader of the second detachment, and Cheng Shuofu is the leader of the third detachment. On the 22nd, Liu Guang, the brigade commander of the brigade, presented a request to the headquarters to add more propagandists, who will be selected from the graduates of the political science department of the military academy. 19 of them have already arrived in Hankou, and the rest are also students from the third term of Whampoa and later, who will hold various positions.</p>
<p>Work Plan: The brigade is divided into three detachments. It was originally planned to station one detachment in each of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. However, because the Communist atmosphere in Hunan is the most rampant and the propaganda work is also more important, it has been decided that the entire brigade will set off for Changsha first. The brigade headquarters will temporarily follow the headquarters of the Fourth Route Army, and each detachment will set off with the Communist suppression troops. In the recovered areas, they will comfort the people and explain the Communist Party's conspiracies and crimes to the masses. At the same time, they will also be responsible for training soldiers. After most of the Communist bandits in Hunan are suppressed, they will work in Liling, Youxian, Liuyang, and Pingjiang, and then transfer to Xiushui, Tonggu, and Wanzai in Jiangxi for propaganda. As for Hubei, because the Communist Party's power is weak and the garrison troops are strong, it is easy to suppress them, so the propaganda work will be postponed. (September 22)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Liaoning Province Seals Up French Merchant Machine Factory <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Factory's Repeated Resistance to Orders and Private Manufacture of Firearms</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The French merchant Feilong Machine Factory was previously found by our side to be privately manufacturing firearms. The Liaoning Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiated with the French Consul and ordered the factory to stop work on the 12th of last month. However, the factory manager, Bao Keshu, outwardly complied but inwardly disobeyed. On the 16th of this month, he gathered many craftsmen at the factory to resume work and privately manufacture rifles. This was discovered by the Commercial Port Public Security First Bureau, which immediately sent police to the factory to stop them and arrest the craftsmen. The craftsmen at the factory, upon seeing this, immediately jumped over the wall and escaped. Only Wang Yao, a supplier of gunpowder, was caught. According to his confession, he was forced to work by Bao Keshu. More than ten newly manufactured rifles were found in the factory. After receiving the report from the Public Security Bureau, the Foreign Affairs Office immediately lodged a serious protest with the French Consul. It also went to the provincial capital with the Public Security Bureau and sent police to seal the factory at 4:00 PM on the 17th. All the public and private debts owed by the factory to the Chinese side must still be negotiated with the French Consul for repayment. As for the large batch of firearms hidden by the factory in Laoguabao, after the Shenyang County Public Security Bureau was ordered to inspect and seize them, the Military Affairs Office of the Chief Executive's Office ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly monitor them and wait for disposal. It is now reported that the authorities intend to confiscate the firearms. (September 19)</p>

<p>The Wounded Soldiers of the Tenth and Twenty-Sixth Rear Hospitals Originally Located in Datong</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>In the past, there was a conflict between the troops and police in Datong due to a misunderstanding, and there were deaths and injuries on both sides. After counting, the recovered wounded soldiers have been transported back to their teams. There are still four to five hundred people in the hospital. The hospital director, Feng Yu, feels that it is difficult to maintain the hospital in Datong because there are no garrison troops there. He has decided to move the hospital to Wuhu. Yesterday, he came to Wuhu with military doctors to find locations such as the Yuwang Palace and Da'an in Henan as hospital sites.</p>
<p>Wang Zhijue, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, came to Wuhu for a tour last time and has not returned to the province. Last night, Sun Shengwu, the Director of the Department of Finance, arrived in Wuhu from Anqing to urge Wang to return to the province to sort out government affairs. It has been decided that he will return to Anqing this afternoon.</p>
<p>The banditry in Wuhua Mountain, Fanchang, Southern Anhui, has recently been almost completely suppressed. However, the banditry in Guangde is still rampant. The Sixth District Bandit Suppression Command dispatched the third battalion of the Weishu Regiment, Feng Jinghai's troops, which were originally sent to Fanchang, to Wuhu yesterday and will be transported to Xuancheng via special train today to suppress the bandits in Guangde.</p>
<p>Farmers in Wuhu Wanchun圩 and other places have experienced rent resistance. The county government has found that someone has been inciting them and carrying the banner of the Farmers' Cooperative to promote rent resistance everywhere. In addition to sending personnel to the countryside to investigate, it also ordered all district self-defense corps yesterday to arrest anyone involved in the above situation. (September 23)</p>

<p>The Township Chief of the Tenth District Kidnapped: Shen Renru, the township chief of Xiaogang Township in the tenth district of the county, has a family that is not particularly wealthy but can barely make ends meet. However, he was coveted by bandits. At 12:00 on the night of the 18th, more than a dozen bandits speaking the local Hakka dialect suddenly came with guns and broke into his house. They dispersed into various rooms and ransacked them, causing considerable losses. Before leaving, they kidnapped Shen Renru, escorted him onto a bandit boat, and took the loot westward. It is said that before leaving, the bandits told his family that they would have to pay 2,000 yuan for his ransom. The district chief has reported this to the county government and requested that the bandits be apprehended and the hostage rescued.</p>
<p>60% of District Administrative Expenses Granted: The county government previously received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs to reduce the administrative expenses of the district offices, stating that the administrative expenses should not exceed one-third of the original budget. The county government allocated the surtax in accordance with the instructions of the Department. All the district chiefs presented the difficult situation of the district's heavy administrative burden to the county government and requested to maintain the original situation. After discussion at the 63rd county administration meeting, the county government decided to allocate 60% of the original budget and submitted it to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. It is now learned that the Department has instructed that Jin County Chief has wired the First District to inform all districts to comply. From September, the monthly administrative expenses for Grade C districts will be 150 yuan, and for Grade D districts, it will be 120 yuan.</p>

<p>Young Woman Commits Suicide Due to Inability to Endure Abuse: Gu Zhenxiang, the second son of Gu Shiqing of Dong Taiping Lane in this county town, is currently studying at Jinling University in Nanjing and will graduate next year. Zhenxiang married Cai Dehua (22 years old), the daughter of Cai Yunkang from the same county, as his wife last winter. The couple's love for each other was very deep after their marriage. Gu and Cai originally married out of free love. However, Zhenxiang's mother, Xu, was very opposed to this. Since Cai entered the door, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had disagreements. Xu often interfered with her daughter-in-law's actions. Whenever Dehua had something to go out, Xu would order her younger daughter, Liwen (currently studying at the Zhihe Midwifery School), to secretly follow her, fearing that she would do something out of line. She also often received scolding from her aunt-in-law. As a result, Dehua was depressed and had long harbored the idea of committing suicide. She had sent valuable items and jewelry to her own mother to wait for a later day. The other day (the 21st), she was scolded by her aunt-in-law for some unknown reason. She secretly went out to buy two bottles of sleeping pills and several boxes of Red Head Matches. She swallowed the sleeping pills on the way, crying as she walked, and suddenly encountered two patrol officers, Zhou Shousong and Li Yongsheng, of the Fourth Sub-Precinct near the entrance of Taiping Lane. The patrol officers saw that she had a depressed look on her face and asked her what was wrong. Dehua did not answer, but threw the small bottle into the trash can and left. The patrol officers knew that something was wrong and used a flashlight to shine on the trash can and discovered the small bottle of sleeping pills and a visiting card. Because the police station was near the Gu family and he was familiar with Cai Dehua, the patrol officer immediately went to the Gu family to report. Her father-in-law, Gu Shiqing, did not pay attention at the time. After Dehua returned home, she wrote two letters of suicide, one to her husband and one to her parents, instructing them to pay off the debts of the various stores and attach the 500 yuan passbook of the Bank of China to her mother. After finishing writing, she swallowed eight boxes of matches and went to sleep. The next morning (the 23rd), when Dehua was seen, her face and limbs were showing signs of abnormality. She was called but did not respond. Sleeping pills were found on the table, and it was known that she had committed suicide by taking poison. A Western doctor was called for emergency treatment. He said that she had taken too much poison and that her life was in danger. Currently, Cai's family has negotiated with the Gu family and telegraphed to Beijing to invite her husband, Zhenxiang, to return home to find a solution.</p>

<p>Another Robbery Case Reported in Tuntian Village: Xu Peixiu, a villager in Tunshiangsang Village near Shitouzhen, a small prosperous village in the Fifth District (Tianshang City), is a farmer who lives a modest life. However, at 12:00 the other night, more than a dozen bandits speaking the local dialect and armed with air guns, knives, clubs, and flashlights broke into his house. They dragged Xu Peixiu and others out of bed, tied them up with ropes, and then ransacked the house at will, looting for an hour before carrying the loot away. After the incident, it was checked and found that 153 yuan in paper money, as well as leather wallets, clothes, gold and silver jewelry, etc., were robbed, totaling more than 1,000 yuan in losses. Dozens of field deeds were also robbed. Yesterday, the victim Xu Peixiu and the head of the village, Pan Wenyin, reported to the county government and requested that the police be sent to investigate and recover the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Prisoners Attempt to Escape from the County Jail Unsuccessfully: Prison guard Xia Xueqin found the other day that four prisoners in rooms 1 and 2, Zhu Jinsheng (not yet sentenced), Zhang Aiyi (sentenced to seven years), Shen Yunqing (eight years, transferred from Shanghai for confinement), and Cai Heyuan (seven years), were digging a tunnel under the floorboards of Cai's room in an attempt to escape through the prison wall. He immediately ordered the police to strictly confine the above-mentioned prisoners and telegraphed County Chief Pan to inform the trial office. Trial Officers Zhou and Yu led the police to inspect the scene and found a tunnel dug under the floorboards of the room, with a small knife and a spatula left next to the tunnel. After questioning, it was clarified that the prisoners had been working at night for five days and used the floorboards to cover the tunnel during the day. Fortunately, three days ago, Gong Jinbao, Chen Shenggu, Yun Jinsheng, and other sick prisoners in the same room reported to the head and deputy directors of the guards, Wang Weizheng and He Shaolin. After detailed investigation and strict precautions, the escape was unsuccessful. Zhou and Yu then interrogated all the above-mentioned people and the four prisoners, Zhu, Zhang, Shen, and Cai. They then ordered the four prisoners, Zhu, etc., to be shackled with large double shackles, confined separately, and closely monitored while awaiting legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Record of a Serial Robbery and Murder Case: Near Nan Shuangmiao Town in the Fifteenth District: Zhou Haojin (also known as Zhou Renbao) and his brother Zhou Genbao were robbed and shot to death.

Zhang then harbored resentment and robbed them. Therefore, Zhang was very suspicious. He requested detention of the case. Yesterday, Supervising Trial Officer Yu and the police went to the countryside to investigate and found that Zhou Xuechen had been shot in a vital part and died, Zhou Genbao's injuries were still minor, and Zhou Haojin's leg bone had been broken by a bullet and his injuries were very serious. Zhu Peisheng and Zhang Fuquan were immediately detained for interrogation. After a thorough interrogation, Zhu Peisheng was ordered to post bail, and Zhang Fuquan was detained pending investigation.</p>

<p>Two Kidnapping and Robbery Cases Occur in One Night: Wang Chunmao, a resident of Quezuicun, Songxia, west of the county, runs a bamboo yard at home. An elder brother is a businessman in Shanghai. He lives with his younger brother Chunnuan, and both are married. The two brothers usually farm, and their hard work has accumulated some savings, leading to the envy of bandits. On the night of the 19th, around 11:00 p.m., more than twenty pirates broke into the house, searching for property and robbing. When the wives of Mao and Nuan pleaded with the bandits, the bandits took out wooden-cased guns to intimidate them and beat them, causing injuries. Before leaving, the bandits kidnapped both Chunmao and Chunnuan, leaving a note demanding a ransom of 15,000 yuan to be contacted at a certain lane in a certain hotel in Shanghai. They then fired shots and whistled, boarding the Dan boat docked in the back sea and leaving. They released Chunmao midway, telling him to raise the ransom to redeem his younger brother. After the villagers learned of this, they gave chase but were shot back by the bandits.

The remaining funds were deposited in the Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank and the Shanghai China Bank, which will soon purchase government bonds and be used in accordance with the foundation's charter.</p>
<p>Resolved Matters: Li Quanshi argued that the allocation of the Society's Sixth Fund should prioritize publishing expenses. After the chairman obtained the consent of the members, it was submitted for discussion and resolved to be handled by the board of directors. The agenda was then discussed item by item. The meeting proceeded as follows: 1. The board of directors proposed that the Society should add sponsoring members. As this involved amending the Society's charter, in accordance with Article 11 of the Society's charter, the charter must be amended with the consent of at least two-thirds of the votes. After the chairman put it to a vote twice, the votes for and against both failed to reach two-thirds, and it was decided to retain the original proposal. 2. The board of directors proposed that membership qualifications should be restricted. Those who have no economic works or have not made contributions to economics studies should not be admitted to the Society. 3. Zhu Bin Yuan proposed that the Society should promote the establishment of branches, and members should be divided into groups to study economic problems to strengthen the spirit of unity and promote academics. All were resolved to be adopted as proposed. 4. Zhu Bin Yuan proposed suggesting that the government quickly establish banking regulations to consolidate the national financial organization. The chairman explained that the National Government's Legislative Yuan has already begun drafting banking laws, and the Society does not seem to need to make further suggestions. The original proposer, Zhu Bin Yuan, stated that he would withdraw the proposal. 5. Li Quanshi proposed that members should strive to make economic science independent and economic books Chinese. It was resolved to be adopted as proposed. 6. Already discussed in advance. 7. Ma Chonggan proposed that the Society should hold more lectures in major ports and publish articles to serve as a reference for society when major economic problems occur in society. 8. Liu Dajun proposed that the chairman of this year's conference should appoint three or five members of the lecture conference committee to consult with members from various places to pre-schedule the lecture conference agenda for the year in various places. The agenda must specify the meeting period, topic of the paper, and the name of the person in charge, and be announced before the general meeting. The above two proposals were resolved to be sent to the board of directors for implementation as originally proposed. 9. Jin Guobao proposed that the Society should promote the development of the Chinese commercial paper market. It was resolved to be adopted as originally proposed. 10. Lin Wei proposed suggesting that the government quickly formulate a national official accounting system. Wei Tingsheng argued that the Ministry of Finance recently organized an accounting committee to improve the accounting system. At the same time, the Central Political Conference also decided to establish a Comptroller Office with separate budget, accounting, and statistics bureaus to rectify revenue and expenditure and improve the accounting system. This proposal does not seem to need to suggest to the government. As a result, it was resolved to publish the original proposal in the Society's quarterly.</p>
<p>Temporary Proposals: Member Gu Tingsheng temporarily proposed that Article 6 of the Society's charter regarding the re-election of directors should be revised and proposed amendments to the charter. After discussion by the public, Article 11 of the charter stipulates that the amendment of the charter must be notified to the members one month before the meeting. The temporary proposal to amend it did not comply with the above provisions. It was resolved that Wei should solicit the endorsement of the members and submit it for discussion and amendment at the next general meeting. Next, Fang Jiaobo, a member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, was introduced by the chairman.</p>
<p>Fundraising: Next, the chairman reported on the fundraising process of the Society, stating that the Society's fund has raised 40,000 to 50,000 yuan through a year of effort and obtained the assistance of Jin Guobao, a member of the Society and the former director of the Nanjing Special Municipality Finance Bureau, to purchase five acres of official land in the old Wangfu of the capital. The land is located in the center of the capital's banks and large companies and is very important. According to market prices, it should be worth more than 10,000 gold. It is now purchased at an official price of more than 2,000 yuan. However, the Society's fund is scheduled to raise 100,000 yuan, and the current amount is still far from the quota. The speaker believes that members should work together to raise funds and propose methods to follow the methods of the National Tsing Hua University Construction Alumni Association to raise 100 yuan of funds from each graduate, which will be accumulated for six years. Each share of interest is also far from 100 yuan, and the principal will be cleared separately to use the interest for construction. The alumni association is very wealthy and has repaid all the borrowed funds. This is indeed the best way to raise funds that can be used as an example. The Society can also imitate each person to raise 100 yuan each. Those who are willing to recognize more can listen. There are more than 400 members in the entire Society, that is, at least 40,000 yuan can be obtained. If it is profitable for seven years, 40,000 yuan of interest can be obtained. At that time, the principal will be repaid separately, and the interest will be used as the Society's fund. Is it feasible to discuss the results of the public decision to pass all the staff to be implemented by the board of directors</p>

<p>Preparing Branches: Finally, the chairman reported that the Society originally had a branch in Shanghai, but because the General Society's board of directors often held meetings in Shanghai, the branch was withdrawn. Now the Hangzhou branch has established a branch due to the large number of members. It seems necessary to restore the organization of the Shanghai branch. After public discussion, it was resolved that one place with more than ten members can write to the General Society to organize a branch; two, the General Society should be stationed in Nanjing, and the Council of the General Society should stipulate that meetings should be held in Beijing; three, the Shanghai branch should actively seek a location and restore the organization.</p>
<p>Next Annual Meeting: Next, the chairman proposed again to discuss and decide the location of the eighth annual meeting to be held next year. After the public expressed their opinions one after another, the following six locations were proposed by each member: Hangzhou, Ningbo, Table Island, Liaoning, Beiping, and Suzhou. The board of directors will consider the situation and select one place as the venue for the next annual meeting.</p>
<p>Elected Directors: The results of the elected directors were announced as follows: President Ma Yinchu, Vice President Liu Dajun, Directors Zhu Bin Yuan, Li Quanshi, Wei Tingsheng, Pan Xulun, Jin Guobao, Xu Jizhi, Liu Binglin</p>
<p>Group Reception: On the 22nd, seven groups, including the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, silk, yarn, flour, silver, and dyeing groups, hired five boats and four sailing boats to entertain all the members to visit Meiyuan, Xiaojishan, Yuantouzhu, Jichang Garden, and Huangbudun. They enjoyed a banquet on the boat from 8:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. before returning.</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Process of Taking Office in Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The principals of Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools took the opportunity to go to the province to swear an oath of office. In advance, they gathered at Zhen Middle School to hold a principals' meeting to discuss funding and other issues. At first, they were unwilling to take the oath, which ultimately led to obedience. This has already been reported in this newspaper. The twists and turns before taking office this time are roughly recorded as follows: After the middle school principals arrived in the province on the 20th, they held a meeting at Zhen Middle School on the same day. Most of the principals believed that they had served as principals for several years and had taken oaths of office in the past. Administrative authorities should separately stipulate dates and send personnel to each school to swear an oath and give speeches to show solemnity. This gathering in the province to hold the ceremony is an innovation that is quite boring and only wastes time and travel expenses. But since they have come, they may as well do as usual, so the first day's meeting decided to resign collectively to the Department of Education after the inauguration ceremony. During the second meeting on the afternoon of the 21st, it was felt that it was too ridiculous to take office first and then resign, and because of excessive arrears in funding, it was difficult for each school to maintain itself. The Department of Education also "hired" the principals as "directors" (and the headmaster of Suxu Middle School was arrested for no reason) and the rights of the principals of the provincial middle schools were too unprotected. Therefore, Zhou Xingbei, Zheng Xigu, Wang Xiacai, and Ren Zhongmin were elected as representatives to go to the Department of Education to seek a delay in holding the oath of office ceremony. Chen and Yao, two members of the Department, agreed to convey this to the director. That night, Chen Hexian returned to Zhen and learned of the principals' meeting. He immediately summoned Wang Xiacai and Ren Zhongmin to his residence for a conversation. Chen told Wang that the oath of office ceremony in the Department had already been prepared and could not be stopped. As for the funding and assistance to the headmaster of Suxu Middle School who was arrested, the Department of Education would do its best to do so. Wang then conveyed this intention to the principals. As a result, the opinions of the middle school principals suddenly diverged. Some insisted on complying with the resolution and resolutely postponing the inauguration for the sake of preserving the resolution and the principals' credibility. Others said that the resolution was to ask four representatives to go to the Department of Education to negotiate a postponement, not not to hold it. Now that the Department of Education has difficulties, it is natural to still comply with the Department of Education's notice and go to the Department on time to take the oath. Some had no opinion at all and were good at observing the situation. Their attitude was neutral. The middle school principals' meeting was divided into four, which was difficult to continue. Finally, it was decided to hold another meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd before going to the Department to take office, and to review the resolution of the previous day. As for the elementary school principals' meeting, the issue of taking office was not discussed when it was held on the 21st. Upon learning of this divergent opinion on the middle school side, the elementary school principals gathered all the principals at the Zhen Middle School Elementary School at 8:30 a.m. yesterday (the 22nd) to discuss the results of the discussion and sent a letter to the Middle School Principals' Association. The original letter stated that the elementary school's collective discussion decided to act in concert with the middle school. The joint meeting of middle and elementary school principals (the middle school principals had the idea of holding a joint meeting with the elementary school principals on the evening of the 21st) seems unnecessary. Please show the middle school principal's record of the day's decision. At the same time, all the elementary school principals waited quietly for the middle school principals' reply at Zhen Middle School Elementary School in order to act in concert. At 10:30 a.m., they received a reply from Zhou Xingbei, chairman of the Middle School Principals' Association, stating that the middle school principals had unanimously decided to go to the Department of Education to take the oath of office immediately. The elementary school principals had no preconceived notions about this, only looking to the middle school principals for guidance and immediately went to the Department to take the oath of office. Most of the middle school principals who initially advocated postponing the inauguration had already arrived at the Department. This is the process before the principals took office.</p>

<p>Ends at the end of this month</p>
<p>New teachers hired by municipal elementary schools in Shanghai should be qualified registrants. The Municipal Bureau of Education fears that various schools are hiring teachers indiscriminately, so it implemented temporary registration before the start of school. It has been three months and should end now. The Bureau has now announced that those who have already registered and submitted certificates but have not passed the oral examination, and those who have already registered and passed but have not yet claimed their certificates, etc., must come to the Bureau to collect them before the end of this month. Do not make a mistake.</p>

<p>Prior to the separation of the city and county of Shanghai, many private schools in rural areas were subsidized by the county education bureau, nominally as substitute elementary schools. After the municipal government took over, this practice continued. The municipal education bureau has now found that the private school subsidy regulations stipulate that only private schools that have been approved for registration can apply for subsidies. As these substitute elementary schools have not applied for registration in accordance with private school regulations, all originally issued subsidies should be stopped to comply with regulations. It is reported that all schools have been notified to stop subsidies immediately.</p>

<p>The schools in the six districts of Shanghai County were originally divided by the County Education Bureau into three school districts, each assigned with one supervisor and two education committee members for rotational inspection. The bureau now considers this approach to be inadequate and has decided to change it from this year onward to eastern and western districts. Districts one, three, and six (formerly the four townships of Minhang, Beiqiao, Maqiao) will be the western school district, while districts two, four, and five (formerly the three townships of Tangwan, Sanlin, Chenxing) will be the eastern school district. However, since each school district has too many schools, making thorough inspections difficult, it is planned that the central school districts will distribute schools, and the central school principals will be responsible for inspections, which will be submitted to the bureau for review. All administrative responsibilities will still be borne by the education committee members.</p>

<p>Since the Fifth Normal School was reorganized into Yangzhou Middle School, the original alumni association has been virtually suspended, and alumni are scattered in all directions, with little communication. A recent survey found that more than 30 alumni are living in Shanghai.

<p>Husband: My dear, don't forbid me to smoke cigars. You should know that most of the great figures in the world smoke cigars. Wait until you become a great figure and then smoke. You are not allowed to smoke now.</p>
<p>Judge (asking a young woman who wants a divorce): Madam, how old are you this year?</p>
<p>Young woman: This year I am twenty-five years old. Judge: Huh? Why are you always twenty-five years old? I remember you said the same thing when you asked for a divorce the year before last.</p>
<p>Young woman: You should know that I am a person who doesn't like to talk nonsense at all. How I said it before is how I say it now.</p>
<p>Old gentleman: So, you want to be my son-in-law? Young man: I dare not, I dare not. But in order to marry your daughter, I have to reluctantly do so.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Postscript of Madame Chiang's Comfort Visit to the Front Lines <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Old Farmer Tian Yu</p>
<p>My friend Huang Junji Yan Yu has been in business in Guide for many years. Yesterday, he sent a letter describing in detail the victories of the national army and Madame Chiang Song Meiling's visit to the front lines to comfort the soldiers. I have specially recorded it in the Free Talk. (The following are all Huang Jun's descriptions in the letter)</p>
<p>After Madame Chiang Song Meiling set off from Xuzhou, she immediately telegraphed the temporary personnel and the key people of the front-line troops to wait for a welcome. When she arrived at the station in the evening, military music was melodious, and the welcomers bowed in salute. Madame smiled and thanked them one by one, and then walked to the camp (the camp was in the train). Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek was already standing next to the road under the poplar tree. Madame hurriedly stepped forward to shake hands and sat on the grass to inquire about the current military and national affairs and the progress plan, and reported the current situation of the National Government and the sincerity of comforting the front-line soldiers. Then she asked about Chiang's hard work in supervising the army and his health. Chiang said with a smile that he was very confident in the military progress and that the elimination of Yan Feng was just around the corner. As for his health, the environment was excellent and he felt more happy mentally. Although he only slept three or four hours a day, his appetite had increased greatly, which was comforting. Those who were sitting around were all solemn and respectful because Madame earnestly encouraged them with national affairs and did not mention personal matters. That night, they stayed in the camp train. The next morning, accompanied by the counselor, secretary, and guards, they went to the front line to inspect everything, inquire about the sufferings of the soldiers, and encourage them with great righteousness. Whenever there was an injured person, Madame would press the wound with her hand and ask about the circumstances when he was hit by the bullet, just like a loving mother treating an infant. She also advised the officers to love the soldiers and share their joys and sorrows. Then there was a thunderous cheer, and they were extremely grateful and vowed to die to repay Madame. Madame thanked them one by one, saying that when she returned in triumph in the future, she would personally celebrate with you all. She then inspected the trenches for a week and saw that the trenches were deep and wide, with electric nets and strict defenses, and the ammunition was abundant. She then said goodbye to the officers and returned to the camp. After talking with Chiang for a while, she took a special train back to Xuzhou and headed south. In recent days, the front-line progress has been rapid. It is said that the soldiers are grateful for Madame's kindness and are not afraid to sacrifice themselves and vow to die to repay her. If so, then Madame will be powerful when she returns in triumph in the future.</p>

<p>The other residence of a certain Mr. in the west of Nanjing city has an area of more than ten acres. There is a pond in the center, which is as clear as a mirror. The surrounding pavilions and terraces are exquisitely structured. When the willow wind comes and the plum blossoms moon up, it is a natural painting. The owner is fond of elegance and has set up an incense community on the pond to worship the wandering immortals. Every morning and evening when the flowers bloom and the moon rises, he gathers famous people to practice divination and chanting. It is customary. My friend Liu Jun Hanbi and the owner are good friends. A month ago, he went to Ning for business and stayed in this garden. He was also invited to join the community. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek was supervising the army on the front line, and there were rumors that he was injured and various other unfavorable news. Liu Jun then asked the altar. The divination pen circled for a long time and then wrote three place names in the capital: Jiangshan (i.e., Zhongshan), Zhengzhong Street, and General An Lane, and then retreated. The crowd was puzzled. Later, after carefully examining the first characters of the names, they realized that it was Chiang Kai-shek An. In early May, Liu Jun returned to the old place and went to the altar to ask how the north and south would win or lose. The divination pen wrote three place names in the capital again: Jiangshan, Zhengzhong Street, Dashengguan, and then retreated, indicating the meaning of Chiang Kai-shek's great victory. In less than ten days, the prediction was fulfilled. Although the matter belongs to superstition and is not enough to be relied on, my friend said it was true and definitely not unfounded. I will just tell it casually, and you can listen to it casually.</p>
<h3 id="e108">On Leaving the Government <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Since the Revolution of 1911, there have been many wars that have never been thoroughly resolved. It's just that one or two leaders leave the government. I, a foolish little Confucian scholar, do not know current affairs and dare not talk nonsense. Today, I will only study the two words "leaving the government" for the purpose of quibbling. According to the mountains and wilderness, the grass and wilderness are relative to the halls and pavilions of the imperial court. The term "leaving the government" is passed down from Japan. When the Emperor of that empire orders the cabinet to be formed, the cabinet ministers who leave their posts are called "leaving the government." It is justified. If our country only has the National Government, only government officials, and no cabinet to enter or court to go to, how can there be wilderness to leave? "Leaving the government," "leaving the government," people say it, and others also say it. It is not only ignorant but also violates the national system. It should be prohibited. If it is prohibited, there must be an appropriate term to replace it. I think that no term is more appropriate than "going to sea." Why is it true? Historically, those who leave the government all go abroad. Instead of twisting and turning to say going abroad, why not frankly call it "going to sea"? Or some people think that the two words "going to sea" are made up. According to my research, Cai Zhuangyuan repaired the Luoyang Bridge, and Xia Dehai made it into Xia Dehai. Therefore, this play is called "Going to Sea". Also, in "Dream of the Red Chamber", Miaoyu was robbed, and this group of robbers instead lit official lanterns and left the city to join the gang at sea. It can be proved that "going to sea" is not made up. Or some people think that actors and robbers are too undignified. According to my research, during the Shunzhi and Kangxi periods of the Qing Dynasty, when troops were used in Taiwan and Penghu, there was an edict that the people of the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang should be moved inland, and fishing boats were not allowed to go to sea. It can be found in the court reports and strategic plans, which are more dignified than the words "leaving the government" under the teeth and spit. Furthermore, the rise and fall of the official sea is the most uncertain. For example, those who were called "leaving the government" in the past often moved for a while to revoke the wanted order and came to be officials again, but there was no appropriate term. Now, it is called "going to sea". If there is a former situation, it can be called "Shanghai" from the evolution of the official sea. There is a classic saying as evidence: "Spring and Autumn Classic, the Western Palace has a disaster." Gongyang Zhuan said: "If there is a Western Palace, then we know that there is an Eastern Palace." Now, according to its example, if there is "going to sea", then we know that there is "Shanghai" too. However, the words "up" and "down" here are verbs, not nouns. In other words, Shanghai is not a concession. Those who go abroad often do not go, or they sneak into the concession, so it is almost impossible to replace "going to sea" with "Shanghai" as a "leaving the government" theory.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Remembering John Bengtsson, Who Died in a Bicycle Accident <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>

<p>Bicycle racing has long been popular in Europe and the United States, but it has never been heard of in China. This time, since the opening of the Weile Garden, Chinese people have been able to see the art of bicycle racing. The news of the opening of Weile Garden has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers, but a tragic incident occurred before the opening. The details of the incident are believed to be known to readers, so there is no need to repeat them. However, there are few descriptions of the facts of the victim himself, so I will describe what I know.</p>
<p>John Bengtsson was the training director of Weile Garden bicycles and was from Sweden. He was 24 years old. He received higher education in Sweden. After graduating, he engaged in navigation. In 1924, he was transferred to the Shanghai Water Patrol Team and then entered the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to the Chinese in the Municipal Council, Bengtsson had no foreign temper at all. Usually, he treated colleagues in the bureau equally, regardless of their rank, and treated people with courtesy. Therefore, colleagues, regardless of Chinese or Western, were happy to associate with him. One day, the Western servant hired in his apartment suddenly suffered from an acute illness. Bengtsson personally took him to the hospital for treatment by car. When getting on and off the car, the patient was unable to move, and Bengtsson personally carried him into the car. This kind of philanthropy is really worthy of our imitation.</p>
<p>Bengtsson was usually known for his athletic skills. When he was in Europe, he won many championships, and his art of riding a bicycle was especially amazing. This time, Bengtsson was one of the initiators of the opening of Weile Garden. He resigned from his position in the Municipal Council before the event and worked day and night for several months to plan the layout of the venue and train the riders. Therefore, Bengtsson contributed half of the effort to the opening of Weile Garden. It was a pity that an unfortunate tragedy occurred a few days before the opening. One day, a Westerner in the venue who was good at driving a motor bicycle was practicing driving, and he was driving quite fast. Bengtsson couldn't help but want to show his skills, so he bravely boarded the car and sped around the venue, thinking of breaking his record. However, although Bengtsson was good at riding a bicycle, he lacked experience in riding a motor bicycle. When driving fast, he accidentally drove out of the track and fell off the road with the car and broke a leg. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment but eventually died. Those who heard about it all mourned and regretted it.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Good News for the People of Hangzhou <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>The people take food as their heaven, so grains are indispensable to us every day. Only the people of Jiangnan eat rice, while the people of the north mostly eat wheat, which is slightly different. My relative, Mr. Wu, has just returned from Wulin and said that the price of rice in Hangzhou has plummeted, which is not without good news for the people's food. Therefore, I will briefly summarize the reasons for the sudden drop in rice prices, which I believe will also be welcome to those who care about the food issue.</p>
<p>According to various counties in Zhejiang Province, such as Zhu, Sheng, Chang, and Yu, they are originally abundant rice-producing areas. There is an old saying that "the fields in Zhu and Ji are ripe, and the whole world eats a bowl of porridge." However, in recent years, there have been years of poor harvests, coupled with good merchants smuggling and hoarding, which has led to a continuous increase in rice prices. It was previously heard that the price of rice in Shanghai was as high as tens of dollars per stone. Alas, the people really have the feeling of cooking with a few grains of rice. This year, the weather has been good, and the fields in Hangzhou and other counties have had bumper harvests. The villagers are all happy. Near the time of the autumn harvest, the farmers in the four villages have been transporting them to the province for sale, and the rice shops are filled with goods, and they cannot be completely accepted. However, the villagers are eager to sell their goods, so several rice merchants who have closed their businesses have seized the opportunity to raise funds to purchase them, and they also sell them at a lower price because the purchase price is low. When the rice shops saw this, they had to immediately cut prices in order to compete for business. It was heard that on the most violent day, the reduction was as much as two yuan. Now, the top rice is only sold for more than eleven yuan per stone. Vegetables, food, and other items have all fallen in price due to the decline in rice prices. This is indeed good news for the citizens of Hangzhou.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>May 27th, a report said that French Academy scholar J. Barthelemp's new school of law advocated leaning towards dictatorship and not focusing on the masses. I have not read the content of his thesis, but based on my years of research, I use the Chinese Doctrine of the Mean to evaluate the facts, and I believe that focusing on dictatorship and focusing on the masses are both biased views. French people recently felt the dictatorship of Russia on the one hand and the dictatorship of Mussolini in Italy on the other. Dictatorship can make the national strength strong, so jurists also advocate dictatorship, but not focusing on the masses in fact has long lost the Doctrine of the Mean. To solve human problems, wisdom, benevolence, and courage are indispensable. If you want to solve problems in electrochemistry, you must be a person who understands electrochemistry. If millions of laymen gather and vote on it, none of them will be correct. In the past, we relied solely on autocracy, and today we move with the roar of the masses. The former way is to bully the weak, and the current way is to use the majority to oppress the minority, which is not the Doctrine of the Mean. My research results show that human nature does not have equality for one day, so it is only possible to do as Mozi said: "How to be a virtuous person? Those who have strength should quickly help others, those who have wealth should strive to share with others, and those who have morality should diligently teach others. If so, the hungry will get food, the cold will get clothes, and the chaos will be governed." (Shangxianxia) Therefore, it must be guided by the wise and knowledgeable before it can be brought into the right track. The Republic of Socrates in ancient times advocated the system of virtuous people, so he was opposed by Anytus and Meletus, who advocated the system of the masses at that time, and was killed, and Socrates' death was decided by a vote of five hundred people. Recently, Spanish philosopher George Santayana 1 3—compared the results of all academic studies and still advocated that the Republic of Socrates may be a system of open access for all classes of men and women, but it must use culture and knowledge, not blindly follow the majority, because the emotions and knowledge of the masses are difficult to rely on. Because numbers cannot produce true right and wrong, world revolutions and extraordinary great causes are mostly created by the unique knowledge of those who leave the number and act alone. However, its plan must be beneficial to the masses. China has followed the ancient Tao of Yao and Shun, which is to advocate virtuous governance and not value autocracy.</p>
<p>May 28th, the Guanghua Daily here suddenly received a government order to suspend publication for three months, which was said to be due to the May Day labor holiday text. A few days ago, the Singapore Republic Daily was also suspended for two months by the government's order because the Japanese consul protested to the British government for publishing the Jinan Massacre. During the suspension period, it was heard that all expenses were still not saved, and the penalty was not small. There are four newspapers here, and Guanghua is the leading one. There is also an English weekly. There are six newspapers in Singapore. Regarding the situation of the Nanyang press, there is an excerpt in the anniversary album published by the Singapore Daily as follows:</p>

<p>Shiba Park. Shiba Park is named because it is located in the Shiba district. In the beginning, most of it was the site of the Zojoji Temple on Mt. Sanyuan. In the sixth year of Meiji, according to the announcement of the Grand Council, Ueno, Asakusa, etc. were changed into parks. Half of the park is the plateau of Akasaka and Azabu. The terrain of Shibaura in the east is extremely low, and this park is located at the protruding end. The undulating hills and old trees are verdant and lush. The total head temple of the Kanto Jodo sect, Zojoji Temple, is located in the center of the park, which is the mausoleum of the Tokugawa family and the Toshogu Shrine. There is a main road running north and south from Omon to Shibaen Bridge. To the east of it are temples and residential areas with park facilities. Electric trains pass through it. Other major roads lead from Omon up Ginkgo Slope, pass in front of the Red Leaf Waterfall, and pass through the Zhaobian Tiantou pond and circle around the roads inside Shibaen Bridge and under the Maruyama and in front of the mountain gate. The main road in the park is divided into twenty-five districts, with the center point of Zojoji Temple and Orei Hall as the first district. To the west of it is a gourd-shaped large ancient tomb, famous for its five-storied pagoda and Maruyama old cedar pavilion, which stand covering the sky and the sun. It is truly a natural forest park. To the south of Maruyama is Toshogu Shrine. There is a large ginkgo tree twenty-one feet high. The plum grove continues to the shrine and autumn grass is planted along the roadside. From the bottom of Maruyama to the south to the Old River, there is a large sports field with a width of 4,000 tsubo. Black pine trees are planted on the mounds along the Old River to create a Japanese garden scene and form a series of hills. To the west of the field is a plum grove, which is called the Silver World. To the west of the grove is Myoteiin. The entrance between the courtyard and the Akahane Bridge is a sports field equipped with various sports equipment. There is a Benten Pond in the depression under the northwest cliff of Maruyama, which is truly a secluded scenic spot. There is an elegant natural stream flowing downstream under the pond, which surrounds the foot of Maruyama and reaches the side of Toshogu Shrine. To the west of the pond is a main road leading directly to Iikura. There is a large azalea garden between the banks of the stream, and the banks are lined with evergreen trees, so the sun cannot be seen during the day, which is very secluded. There is a waterfall on the cliff, so it is commonly called Red Leaf Waterfall. Near the waterfall is a small fairyland. The end of the stream is long and thin, irrigating Benten Pond. The slope to the west of the waterfall is called Red Leaf Slope. Climbing up, there is Sanrokudo, originally the site of the Noh theater. To the west of it is the famous Kondi-in. During the Tokugawa era, it was the office of the head of the green company, and Monk Honko (Soden) moved here from Edo Castle. The area near it is called Red Leaf Mountain, because there are many maple trees on the mountain. From the Red Leaf Hall, the valley roads along the Iikura area are lined with old trees, which are very reminiscent of deep mountains and valleys. Along this road is a small forest spring, which was formerly the garden of Rurikoji Temple. It has recently been purchased as a park. If you reach the highlands of No. 25 in the north, you can see most of the city. The area from Ginkgo Slope to Omon is called Matsubara Region. Square old pine forests stand, and the same is true in front of the mountain gate. It reaches Shibaen Bridge and points at the pines to accumulate fresh air. Central history and natural scenery are the true natural forest park. After visiting the park, Mr. Uchida and Ms. Shakae with whom I went together, took an automatic camera and took a photo together in front of the fountain in the park to commemorate it.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Financial and Gold Market Trends Are Sensitive and Active <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The trend seems to be forward-moving. Yesterday, the 24th, the gold market seemed to show a solid interest, with the intention to increase. However, there were fluctuations of two taels at times. Throughout the day, there were differences totaling more than five taels, but ultimately, an upward trend was seen and the market was sensitive and active. As for foreign exchange, the trend was firm. There was no lack of interbank trading, with buyers being the majority. Yuanxing, Yongyuan, Yuancheng, Yongyu, Dada, Decheng, etc., had unsettled receipts and payments. Yuanmao, Yongzhi, and Fengyong sold items for hedging, while Taikangrun, Hanheng, etc., mostly bought in. From the early market, the opening was high, breaking through the 40-tael mark, as it was rumored that Japan had shipped cash to Citibank. Upon hearing this news, those in the industry were excited. Later, due to the active selling, there was a brief softening, but the buyers were persistent, and those covering short positions also came in droves, causing a sudden jump of more than four taels. In addition, drafts became increasingly tight. Later, the market strengthened and then weakened, with a fluctuation of about three taels, likely because Yuanmao, Yong, etc., turned from buying to selling, which caused some confusion in the market. However, due to it being Wednesday, there was no market for drafts. The final gold price was 43 taels.</p>
<p>The morning market fluctuated. In November, the opening price in the morning rose by 2 taels and 1 mace to 542 taels. Large bars were not improved, as there was talk that Japan was planning to ship cash to Citibank, which caused the market to rise. Later, there was a fluctuation of more than one tael, reaching over 40 taels and 6-7 mace. Especially since the British gold for the next month had been sold by Sumitomo at 7 pence 9375 to the shilling, the announcement was not moved, and it had already returned to over one tael, calculated at 42 taels and 4 mace. Then, a drop of one tael was seen, as Dada, Decheng, Yu, Dazhifeng, Yong, etc., sold. Also, China Bank made a pair of December U.S. dollars at $40.06875. Therefore, after 10:15, the price was 40 taels and 5 mace. After that, it gradually moved forward, with a slight rotation of one tael. Shillings were also excellent. Mitsui bought October at 7 pence 9375. McCalle bought December U.S. dollars at $40.0625. Mitsui bought January British gold at 8 pence 125. Then, 125 for December could be sold. Yuancheng, Yongyuanmao, Yong, and items were eagerly seeking to buy. After 11:00, it had broken through to 44 taels, with a fluctuation of several mace. After 11:25, it reached 44 taels and 89 mace. After a while, it fell back several mace, calculated at 44 taels and 12 mace, which was the short side suppressing the small account. The drafts were stable. At noon closing, 44 taels and 3 mace rose again by 6-7 mace, as the items had not yet been entered and had been pulled up. The indicated price was 597 taels, with a small press of 55 taels to 52-3 taels. The registered price was 58 taels for this month, 48 taels for the next month, 44 taels for November, and a water supplement of 56 taels. Items were 2 taels in the early morning, 5 taels at noon, 4 taels and 7 mace in the afternoon, and 3 taels at closing. The receipts and payments of the various numbers were divergent.

<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's Shanghai silver market trading atmosphere was slightly better than the previous few days. Most people were not very enthusiastic. As a result, the situation turned soft. However, according to the current market atmosphere, there is indeed a possibility of an upward trend, and eventually it will be too low. After several days of increasing, the silver basis also leveled off yesterday. However, judging from the situation, there may be special changes in the day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot trading of public bonds continued to be scarce, and the futures market was slightly more prosperous than before. The market situation was still firm in the early morning. Customs tariff consolidation and dispatch were slightly smoother than the previous day. After the rise, due to the fact that people's hearts were more vain, selling accounted for the majority, and the price turned weak. As a result, troop reduction and dispatch both fell quite sharply. Dispatch futures fell by about one yuan, and troop reduction fell by one yuan and four and a half cents in October. Spot goods for dispatch and troop reduction fell by as much as two yuan and eight cents each. Other declines were very slight.

<p>The cotton market is trending firm. However, the decline in American cotton is not yet stable, and new low prices are gradually being discovered. Most people in this port are optimistic because the yarn market is rising and the cotton market is still flat. The purchase of goods in various townships and inland areas is firmer, so the bulls are tightening and still not letting go. Moreover, a part of them are buying more. The market is rising from this. However, various factories are currently importing Indian cotton, and various firms are eager to find a way out and are extremely accommodating to Japanese factories. The more they buy, the greater the number of long-term yarns opened by Japanese factories, and they do not handle local cotton and buy Indian cotton instead.</p>
<p>Piao Zhun The market is trending upward. At the opening of the Han Label market in the previous market, the selling households were lacking due to the firm yarn market, and the market rose by two cents to five cents. In the afternoon, there were also large households buying in, and the market atmosphere was still firm. Although American cotton fell, people's hearts were still rising.

<p>More than 30 ships arrived at Zhabei yesterday, and the market was even more sluggish. The decline in new japonica rice was even more dramatic. The top-quality goods were seen to have fallen by six or seven cents and only opened at 18 yuan and two cents, while the middle pass had to be fiercely cut by one yuan, three or four cents. The middle and secondary prices fell back to the 15-yuan mark. In total, the price has fallen by as much as 3 yuan in these few days. Dongxin japonica suddenly fell by one yuan to a large amount of 16 yuan and a half, but the buying interest was still not strong. The high-quality New Sheep Tip opened at 13 yuan and four cents, and the Du Tip opened at 14 yuan and four cents. The secondary price to 12 yuan and a half or more has been reduced by two or three cents to four or five cents. The passenger tips and port tips are all at 12 yuan, eight or nine cents as the highest, while the average is only 12 yuan, three or four cents, and the middle and secondary prices have been reduced to 11 yuan and a half. In total, it is about three cents shorter than the previous day. The whole day's indica situation has returned because the arrival of goods is slightly thin, and the japonica market is collapsing wildly. Bai Yuan has decreased by half a yuan, and the top-quality goods opened at 18 yuan. The market situation is even more sluggish. Two or thirty ships arrived in the south of Shanghai, and the sales were large. Because the gate market has been collapsing repeatedly, the buying interest is very quiet, and all prices have fallen sharply. The Changbang top new japonica opened at 18 yuan, the Sutongbang new japonica opened at 17 yuan to 16 yuan and a half, and the South Road new japonica opened at only 16 yuan above. The top-quality new japonica opened at 18 yuan, the Sutongbang new japonica opened at 17 yuan to 16 yuan and a half, and the South Road new japonica opened at only 16 yuan and a half above.

<p>Jiangxi Rice Yesterday, Jiangxi rice continued to arrive, and people's hearts were softer. There was an image of falling step by step after the market opened. Fortunately, the Tianjin gang purchased 500 bags of Jiangxi machine early in the market, and the market was able to support it, but it was a corner and a half less than the previous day. Because this street has Du Xian on the market, the intention to enter Jiangxi rice is also weakening. The total market transaction was 700 bags of Jiangxi machine early, priced at 11 yuan, three cents and a half to 10 yuan and eight cents, and 87 bags of machine late, priced at 13 yuan, and 20 bags of machine yuan, priced at 16 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Hunan Rice Hunan Rice Because the production area has too many donations and taxes, and Hankou has to add taxes, and the bandits and communists are rampant, merchants dare not try to handle it, which leads to a long-term lack of arrival. There are still 12,000 bags of Zhongguan goods remaining in the destination, and they have not been sold. Wuhu Nanjing rice is transported by train, but most of them are coarse rice purchased by Shanghai rice factories. There is very little white Xian transport, which is especially rare. Yesterday, another batch of Wuji rice arrived and was sold on the market. 70 bags of machine rice were priced at 10 yuan and seven cents, which was also more than one yuan less than the price sold a few days ago.</p>

<p>Foreign wheat reports small... Initially soft, the factory maintained... then rose</p>
<p>Yesterday, the noodle market had a rise or fall of three or four points. The reason was that at the beginning of the morning market, a small telegram of eight cents to one yuan was received for foreign wheat, and various foreign firms sold foreign noodles and foreign wheat very closely. Therefore, the market was very soft and the selling atmosphere was extremely strong. This month, it fell by three points, and there was a great tendency to return to two taels and four cents, while various futures were also slightly smaller by one or two points, etc. When a certain large factory opened the market in B City, it came to see that the noodle price had turned down, and it was slightly touched. However, the number of entries was very small, so the market price rose slightly by a few points. Then, when B City opened the market, a large factory entered the recent period to maintain the downward trend, so it tried its best to raise the price. Therefore, the floating air suddenly panicked, and the price was raised by two or three points in unison. The various distances were also raised by half a point. However, the purpose of the factory was to raise the price and wait for the due date to sell the distant period, so the result of the closing was that the recent period was firm and the distant period was weak. The difference from the initial opening in the morning was three points larger. Compared with the previous day, September was one point larger, October was two cents and a half larger, November and December were both one point and two cents and a half smaller, January was seven cents and a half smaller, and February was half a point smaller.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Trend in the Futures Wheat Market Is Declining <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the inland gangs had quite a few outgoing contracts, and the quoted prices of foreign wheat were frequently small. The multi-party were mainly closing, so although there were a few numbers to maintain, the market situation was always depressed. The price of the current month had fallen to four taels and seven cents. Then, due to the transfer of noodle news, the buying sentiment was slightly turned up, and the market situation gradually became firm. After the opening of the afternoon market, the near and distant periods only had a rotation of one or two points, and they could not follow the noodle market to move upward. The reason was that the northern routes such as Niuzhuang had recently arrived in Shanghai one after another, so this cargo customer changed to throw into the standard due to the factory's unfavorable stomach. Also, the current month was about to stop trading and delivery, so it was unusually appropriate to throw down at this time. Therefore, the wheat price was not easy to see better, and the distant months were affected by foreign wheat and the spot price was flat. The noodle price was also very ordinary, so it fell to the 60-cent mark. As a result, compared with the previous day, the September period was two points smaller, the October period and the January period were three points smaller, and November, December, and February were all four points smaller.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Dalian futures soybean market was reported to be firm and the inland gangs moved slightly, causing the market to fall sharply and recover slightly. Therefore, the market was still firm due to the continued entry of passenger gangs after the market closed. The December opening was five taels and seven cents, which was estimated to be six or seven cents better.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market still lacked the possibility of turning smooth. It was found that the Chinese silk merchants were eager to sell because they needed to transfer money during the Mid-Autumn Festival and their silk inventory was increasing day by day. Taking this situation into account, European and American hoarders have been unrelenting in suppressing prices and there have been few transactions. Only China General and other companies have entered 30 packages of Shanghai White Factory, and Qianli and other companies have entered 30 packages of White Dry Warp, and the prices have been flat and weak.</p>

<h3 id="e187">City Government Organizes Relief for Liaoxi Flood Yesterday <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Temporary Change to Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>Successful and Joyful Conclusion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, deeply concerned about the severity of the Liaoxi flood and the urgent need for relief, convened representatives from various sectors of the city to discuss relief measures and organized a fundraising committee to actively carry out the work, as reported previously. It is now learned that the Municipal Government invited leaders from various Party, government, commercial, and community organizations in the city to a discussion meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant on Sima Road at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss relief efforts. Over three hundred people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Wang Yiting. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Change to Discussion Meeting: The Municipal Government originally intended to hold a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant when sending out invitations the day before. However, due to a central government order to suspend entertainment banquets for three days following the death of Acting Chairman of the National Government, Tan Yankai, the event was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting. A letter was sent to community leaders stating: "Regarding the relief efforts for the Liaoxi flood, we previously sent an invitation to you to attend a meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant on the 24th of this month at 6:00 PM to discuss implementation methods. However, due to the death of Acting Chairman of the National Government, Tan Yankai, we have been ordered to suspend entertainment banquets for three days. As the matter concerns disaster relief, it is inconvenient to postpone the event, so we have changed it to a discussion meeting at the same location. Your presence is requested."</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the meeting commenced, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating: "Gentlemen, Mayor Zhang has asked me to invite you here today to discuss relief measures for the Northeast flood. We are honored that you have accepted the invitation. Mayor Zhang himself is in Shenyang and unable to return to Shanghai, so he has asked me to represent him. I will briefly report on the situation of the Liaoxi flood. As you have likely seen in the newspapers, the affected area spans approximately six to seven hundred li wide and two to three hundred li long. The death toll is already five to six thousand, and hundreds of thousands are homeless. The weather is getting colder, and the disaster victims are suffering greatly. As winter approaches, their suffering will be even more unbearable. Mayor Zhang, having witnessed the situation in Shenyang firsthand, is deeply saddened and has repeatedly instructed us to request your enthusiastic support for relief efforts. Shanghai has always been known for its generosity and has never lagged behind in providing relief to disaster areas, earning the admiration of other regions and bringing glory to our city. The Liaoxi flood is exceptionally severe, and we must uphold the principle of benevolence and actively strive to be the first to help. I have previously met with community leaders at the Gongyu Club and decided to organize a Northeast Flood Relief Committee to actively carry out the work. However, the success of this effort depends on the collective strength of everyone. We hope that you will contribute generously and provide ample guidance so that the hundreds of thousands of starving disaster victims can be quickly relieved of their suffering. This is not only what Mayor Zhang hopes for, but also what the entire population of Shanghai hopes for."</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: Ye Huijun spoke next, stating: "Today, Mayor Zhang entrusted Secretary-General Yu to invite everyone here to discuss relief measures for the Liaoxi flood. Based on my understanding of the suffering of the Liaoxi disaster victims, the citizens of Shanghai should work together and contribute generously." Wang Xiaolai then spoke, stating: "Secretary-General Yu has clearly explained the purpose of this gathering tonight. Shanghai is much more comfortable than other places, so we should make even greater efforts to provide relief to the Northeast flood. Shanghai is a model for the whole country. In the past, whenever there was a disaster anywhere, we were always the first to provide relief. We hope that everyone will be charitable and contribute generously to this Liaoxi flood. As for fundraising methods, we can hold variety shows or direct fundraising." Zhang Xiaolin spoke next, stating: "Today, as we discuss fundraising methods, I have four suggestions: First, we can raise funds through opera performances, with Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Mr. Du Yuesheng in charge. Second, we can have dances, with Ms. Zheng Yuxiu in charge. Third, we can organize games and activities, and I suggest the Municipal Government contact them. Fourth, we can have on-the-spot donations. I hope that everyone will discuss these four methods." Xu Shiying then spoke, stating: "The Liaoxi flood is extremely serious. The chairman and Mr. Zhang have all mentioned several fundraising methods. I am the chairman of the Relief Committee, and today I would like to say a few words in my personal capacity. In the past, Shanghai has always been the most generous in providing relief donations to various provinces. I strongly support everyone's enthusiasm in fundraising and proposing various methods, and I hope that everyone present will make on-the-spot pledges, whether it is one dollar, one thousand, or ten thousand dollars. In short, every extra dollar donated will benefit the disaster victims." Yu Qiaqing spoke next, stating: "I deeply agree with Mr. Xu Shiying's remarks. The disaster victims in the Northeast are displaced and suffering, and they are in urgent need of rescue. Moreover, the Northeast authorities are doing their best to support the central government, making the central government more stable and ensuring the security of the rear. All of us in the rear should emulate the Northeast authorities' dedication to saving the country and the people and contribute as much as we can to alleviate the suffering of the Northeast disaster victims. The government has already prepared 200,000 yuan. If Shanghai can raise a considerable amount, then many more disaster victims in the Northeast will be saved. I hope that everyone present will donate as they see fit, the more the better."</p>
<p>On-the-Spot Donations: Community leaders expressed their strong support for on-the-spot donations and immediately made pledges. The Municipal Government pledged 10,000 yuan, and various organizations and leaders pledged a total of more than 16,500 yuan, totaling more than 26,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Successful Conclusion: After community leaders and merchants made their pledges, the results were deemed very satisfactory, and everyone dispersed happily. It was already past 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Tang Shaoyi Comes to Shanghai on a Mission <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>To Discuss Matters Related to Zhongshan Port</p>
<p>Dalu Bao reported that Tang Shaoyi, a senior advisor to the National Government, returned to Shanghai a few days ago after spending three months in Guangdong. When a reporter visited Mr. Tang yesterday, he said that the rumors circulating that the Northern faction had sent someone to contact him to form a government were completely unfounded. He had not even heard of these rumors until he arrived in Hong Kong on this trip to Shanghai. He immediately issued a statement to foreign newspapers to clarify the matter. The main purpose of his return to Shanghai was to discuss the construction of Zhongshan Port with the central government. The construction of the port is currently progressing rapidly, but due to the scale of the project, it cannot be completed in a short time. The port will be a free trade port for the next sixty years, but it will not affect Hong Kong. Hong Kong's foundation is solid, and it has a good government to administer it. He believes that the opening of Zhongshan Port may actually make Hong Kong and Guangzhou more prosperous. He will go to Nanjing soon to discuss port affairs with government officials. When asked if he intends to accept the invitation from US President Hoover to visit the United States after he took office, Mr. Tang replied that he would very much like to have the opportunity to reminisce with President Hoover. He may be able to give a definite answer on this matter after his trip to Nanjing.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Xiangtai and Jiangxin Collide at Wusong Port <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Both Ships Damaged</p>
<p>Xiangtai Already in Dock</p>
<p>The Jiangxin, a Yangtze River ship belonging to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was damaged when it collided with the British ship Xiangtai while transporting goods from Shanghai to Hankou at Wusong Port. The bow of the Xiangtai was severely damaged. Details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Collision Details: The Jiangxin of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company left Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd and was sailing towards Wusong Port at about 9:00 AM, following the shipping channel. The Xiangtai, a Yangtze River ship of the Xiangtai Shipping Company, was sailing downstream from Hankou to Shanghai. The two ships met inside Wusong Port, heading in the same direction. At that time, the morning tide was rising, and the current was rapid. The crew of the Jiangxin saw the Xiangtai heading straight towards the left side. Unexpectedly, the current was strong, and the Xiangtai collided head-on with the Jiangxin in an instant. The Jiangxin immediately reversed, narrowly avoiding a head-on collision, but the right side of the hull was struck by the bow of the Xiangtai, damaging the iron plates and the hull.</p>
<p>Damage Condition: The Jiangxin is larger than the Xiangtai, and its steel plates are also stronger. When the Xiangtai struck, the Jiangxin managed to reverse, so the damage to the outside of the hull was above the waterline and did not affect navigation. When the Xiangtai collided with the Jiangxin, it could not stop due to the strong tide. The shipmaster, Mr. Richee, also reversed, but could not avoid the collision. Both ships were heavily loaded. The bow of the Xiangtai was severely damaged, and the iron plates were broken, making it impossible to navigate. Fortunately, the passengers and crew were already up, so no one was injured. Afterwards, the Xiangtai was towed to the dock, and the Jiangxin left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Repair News: The Jiangxin's schedule was tight, and the damage was above the waterline, so it continued to Hankou. The damaged part was repaired by the crew en route. It will be inspected and repaired further when it returns to Shanghai. The Xiangtai was towed to the dock, and the goods were unloaded. The shipmaster reported the damage to the customs and Shanghai authorities. The bow was severely damaged, and it was towed to the Ruirong Shipyard yesterday at noon for major repairs. The responsibility for the collision will be determined after an on-site investigation by both parties.</p>
<h3 id="e195">News from the Shipping Industry <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Approval Fee to Increase: The Jianghai Customs has increased the application fee for import and export cargo loading and unloading night work by 80% at the request of various shipping companies. Shanghai shipping merchants held two public consultations and jointly requested the Tax Bureau to consider the difficulties of the shipping merchants and waive the increase. The Tax Bureau rejected the request. The previous day, another letter was sent appealing the decision. Yesterday, it was learned that the Customs had replied that the approval fee was set 50 years ago, and now that material costs have increased, it is not possible to maintain the original tax rate. The approved 80% increase will be implemented from August 16th. The request for exemption was rejected.</p>
<p>Straw Hat Fee Ordered to be Reduced: The Lian'an Shipping Company on the Shanghai-Taiwan route increased the freight rate for straw hats from the three counties of Linhai, Zhejiang. Wang Chongde, a representative of the industry's labor union, appealed to the Ministry of Communications to stop this practice, stating that the company controlled customs and shipping and repeatedly increased the straw hat freight rate from one li to eight li. Straw hats are one of the country's export goods, which is contrary to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's policy of encouraging industry, providing financial assistance, and facilitating transportation. The Ministry of Communications has ordered the company to reduce the freight rate immediately to avoid monopolizing shipping.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Singaporean Organizations Petition for Lower Postal Rates for Overseas Chinese Letters <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Will Join Forces to Appeal Again</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China received a petition from various Singaporean organizations to reduce postal rates for overseas Chinese letters. A letter from Lin Jindian, chairman of the delegation representing the Singaporean Overseas Chinese Congress, states: "To the Overseas Chinese Federation: Our association has submitted a document to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications, requesting that they approve the previous request to establish special regulations based on international postal treaties to maintain the overseas Chinese practice of sending remittances and letters. The overseas Chinese postal service is crucial to the livelihood of overseas Chinese families. We have repeatedly appealed over the years, and while we are grateful for the understanding shown in reducing postal rates and revoking the suppression order, the request to establish special regulations with the British postal service has not been approved. Last month, we received a reply from the Ministry of Communications stating that the Postal Administration believed that special regulations were not necessary and might cause disputes that would be detrimental to the private postal service. Moreover, the existence of private postal services in our country makes it appear that our postal system is not unified, which is inconvenient in the international arena. The Nanyang Islands are British and Dutch territories, not independent countries, so rejection would be detrimental to the national image. Therefore, it is appropriate not to propose special regulations. We were shocked and worried to hear this. We do not know on what basis the Postal Administration made these claims. We convened a meeting to discuss the matter in detail. Everyone believes that the Ministry of Communications understands the hardships of overseas Chinese and cares for them greatly. However, the Ministry has instructed that the Postal Administration's proposal be followed, rejecting the overseas Chinese request, which is regrettable. We believe that the Postal Administration may not have international common sense or may be disregarding the overseas Chinese. We will rebut the Postal Administration's claims to the Ministry of Communications: (1) Private postal services at home and abroad were established for overseas Chinese to send remittances and letters to support their families. The matter is of utmost importance. Over the years, the Chinese government and local governments have issued suppression orders. The overseas Chinese have appealed and requested the preservation of the service, and then requested a reduction in rates. To permanently protect the service and provide a thorough solution, we requested the establishment of special regulations. However, the Postal Administration believes that special regulations are not necessary. We do not know the reason for this. If the British government resumes its suppression, how can we reject it? This is incomprehensible. (2) Negotiating special regulations is to avoid suppression and eliminate disputes, which is essential for the protection of the private postal service. However, the Postal Administration reverses the argument, saying that special regulations might cause disputes that would be detrimental to the private postal service. This is an unimaginable statement that leaves overseas Chinese in a state of confusion. Will special regulations cause disputes and be detrimental? What kind of disputes and what kind of harm will be caused? This is not clearly explained to us, and this is also incomprehensible. (3) The Postal Administration states that the Nanyang Islands are British and Dutch territories, not independent countries, so rejection would be detrimental to the national image. Therefore, it is appropriate not to propose special regulations. If so, if overseas Chinese in other regions encounter other major events, the Chinese government will also use the same excuse that the region is not an independent country, rejection would be detrimental to the national image, and allow overseas Chinese to be trampled on and abused. This will leave overseas Chinese in Nanyang without any protection. It is painful to say and brings tears to think about. This is also incomprehensible. Negotiating special regulations is based on the international postal treaty. Postal treaty countries have the right to negotiate with each other. Why would it be rejected? Moreover, we have not yet proposed it, so how do we know that the other party will reject it? Furthermore, last year, when negotiating with the British postal service about increasing postal rates, why was the issue of independent countries not considered? Why was there no fear of rejection? Why was the national image not considered? Is it because tax revenue is more important? The Singaporean private postal service has been operating for 70 or 80 years. The local government issued a license and approved its operation, which is a confirmation of its existence. The recent approval of the request to reduce postal rates was automatic, without the need to seek the opinion of international postal treaty countries, and there were no restrictions on the type of case. This clearly shows that the processing of individual special postal items between Nanyang and our country does not violate the international postal treaty and is not subject to interference by international postal treaty countries. To maintain the livelihood of families, special regulations are essential to prevent suppression of the private postal service. Therefore, we have unanimously decided to appeal again, earnestly requesting that the Postal Administration be instructed to negotiate special regulations with the British government to maintain the overseas Chinese practice of sending letters and remittances to support their families. We urgently await your reply. When private letters arrive in Xiamen and are transferred to the interior, and when return letters are sent from the interior to Xiamen, the Xiamen Post Office still requires additional postage stamps. We previously requested that this be cancelled, but it was not approved. We have decided to allow letters to be taken to the Xiamen Post Office and other inland post offices for inspection and stamping, and then resealed and delivered by the post office to avoid smuggling. We urgently request that you approve this request and cancel the additional postage to alleviate the hardship of overseas Chinese." The petition from the Singaporean organizations requesting a reduction in postal rates for overseas Chinese letters was submitted by Lin Jindian, chairman of the delegation representing the Singaporean Overseas Chinese Congress. The Overseas Chinese Federation believes that it is their responsibility to appeal again to the transportation authorities to approve the request of the overseas Chinese Congress to facilitate the sending of remittances and letters by overseas Chinese and to maintain the livelihood of millions of overseas Chinese families.</p>

<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported on Japan's refusal to allow Chinese people to enter. Due to the contraction of various factories in Japan this year, over five hundred Chinese laborers who were working in Japan have been laid off and sent back to China in succession. Recently, forty-five Chinese workers from Yokohama, Japan, all from WenZhou and Qingtian counties in Zhejiang province, were also dismissed and unable to make a living in Japan. They were repatriated to Shanghai by the Japanese authorities and are now in a very distressed state. After arriving in Shanghai, some of these laborers have returned to their hometowns, while the rest, lacking a livelihood, are staying in small inns in the Nanshi area. In addition, more than ten Chinese people from the Kobe area have also been expelled and sent back to China.</p>

<p>Zhou Dabang and Son Flee</p>
<p>At around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, a young female corpse suddenly floated up in the Xiaohang Pond in front of the Nunnery in the West Market of Jiangwan, causing a sensation far and wide. Everyone was talking about it, but no one knew where the corpse came from. It was not until dusk that a woman named Yu Zhang came out to identify the body as her daughter. The details of the case are extremely strange, as the deceased is suspected of being murdered by her fiancé. The murderer has now fled. The details of this case are as follows:</p>
<p>Yu's Family Background: Yu Zhang, a woman residing in a northern house on Wan'an Road, Jiangwan, is originally from Wuxi. She is forty-three years old. Her husband, A San, is fifty-three years old. He used to be a groom at the Shanghai Racecourse but is now unemployed due to old age and weakness. They have two sons and two daughters. The eldest daughter, Xingmei, is already married. The second daughter, A Mao, is twenty-eight years old and beautiful. She is the murdered daughter. The two sons are Zhao Da, eleven years old, and a younger brother only five years old. Zhang makes a living by renting several acres of land for farming, which is enough to keep the family warm and fed.</p>
<p>A Mao's Child Betrothal: Yu Zhang's second daughter, A Mao, was promised in marriage to Zhou Yusheng, the youngest son of Zhou Dabang, a wealthy man in Dongtangjiaqiao, North Township, Jiangwan, through a matchmaker since she was a child. For the sake of saving expenses, A Mao was brought into the family as a child bride at the age of thirteen. However, Yusheng, who was nine years older than A Mao, had already had his first stirrings of love and wanted to take advantage of her, but he was unsuccessful because his fiancée was too young.</p>
<p>Forced Marriage Fails: Zhou Yusheng's father, Zhou Dabang, and his wife, Yan, had two sons, the eldest, Yinsheng, is thirty-one years old, and the second, Yusheng, is twenty-five years old. Both are workers in the Huafeng Yarn Factory, earning a meager living. Dabang longed for a grandson and wanted to marry his son as soon as possible, but he could not afford it due to economic constraints. He thought that his unmarried daughter-in-law was already in the house, so if they married early, he could avoid all the expenses. On the twenty-seventh day of the seventh lunar month, he forced A Mao to sleep with his son, but A Mao refused, resulting in her being scolded by her father-in-law. A Mao was extremely angry and fled to her mother's house that night, crying and telling her the whole story.</p>
<p>Sending the Daughter to Her Death: Although Yu Zhang hated Zhou Dabang's improper behavior, she feared that it would cause further trouble. The next morning, she accompanied her daughter back to Zhou's house and comforted her before returning home. However, two days later (the day before yesterday), on her way home from the fields, she heard people say that a woman had drowned in the Bingtang Pond, and that her appearance and clothes were similar to her daughter's. She went to see it out of curiosity and could not help but burst into tears. The corpse was indeed her daughter, A Mao.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Authorities: Yu Zhang believed that her daughter's death was strange, so she reported it to the Fifth Precinct, Fifth Station, claiming that her daughter had been mistreated by her father-in-law and had returned home. She had personally sent her back, but now she had suddenly died in the river, which was suspected to have been murdered by her father-in-law. She requested that the case be investigated. The station, considering the seriousness of the case, immediately ordered the patrolman to go to Dongtangjiaqiao to arrest the murderer, but Zhou Dabang and his son, Yusheng, had fled and could not be found. Zhou's wife, Yan, and her eldest son, Yinsheng, were arrested and interrogated, but they both claimed that they knew nothing. Yesterday morning, a document was prepared to send Zhou Yan and her son to the judicial department for further investigation. The police were also ordered to strictly arrest Zhou Dabang and Zhou Yusheng who are at large in order to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>

Later, the remaining nine boxes were all opened and inspected, and it was found that each box contained ten handguns. Including the previous ones, a total of ninety-five handguns were seized.

<p>Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th team of the 4th district of the Wusong Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team, received a tip the night before last night around 9 p.m. that a large group of pirates aboard more than 20 pirate ships were robbing merchant ships in the Xiaomiao Hongyang waters outside Wusong Port. After receiving the report, Captain Gong immediately led a platoon of water police aboard the Pingyang warship and ordered Gong Yaozu, the captain of the Jinghai gunboat under his command, to proceed in separate directions. After searching for two hours, the two ships did not find any trace of the pirates. The Jinghai gunboat then sailed to the shallow beach on the Xigang waters and found two sailboats anchored there. Initially, they thought they were pirate ships and immediately inspected them, but they were empty ships with no one in charge. The two empty ships were then towed back to the team headquarters. After investigation, it was found that one of the ships was the No. 3 cargo ship of the No. 2 factory of Dasheng Yarn Factory, and the other belonged to Zhu Fuchang, a boatman there. Both ships had been robbed by pirates near Shangmiao Hong the day before yesterday. After confirming the facts, Captain Gong has already notified the shipowners separately to claim them yesterday and reported them to the district headquarters.</p>

<p>Sister, Thinking of Her Kin, Voluntarily Withdraws the Case</p>
<p>Crime Upon Crime, Unpardonable</p>
<p>Shen Bangchao, a forty-four-year-old man from Gaoyou, residing at No. 11, Zhilu, Youche Street, Nanshi, married a woman from the same hometown, Ji, as his wife and had a daughter named Qiaoyun, who is six years old. Ji's younger brother, Xinglou (thirty-six years old), is a rascal. On the twenty-ninth day of the seventh lunar month of this year, Xinglou actually lured his niece, Qiaoyun, to Pudong and sold her to someone surnamed Mou at Nanmatou to be a daughter, agreeing on a price of 20 yuan and falsely claiming that Qiaoyun was his own daughter. Because his wife had recently passed away and there was no one to take care of his young daughter, he sold her. Mou trusted him deeply. Unexpectedly, Qiaoyun was still childish and kept calling him uncle, which aroused Mou's suspicion. After repeated questioning, she finally told the truth. Mou was afraid of being implicated and immediately sent her to the Third Division of the Third District. After the station chief learned the truth, he sent police to Puxi to summon Qiaoyun's father, Shen Bangchao. Shen was out, so Ji went instead. After Xinglou repeatedly begged, Ji, thinking of their kinship, was unwilling to pursue the matter excessively, so the Third Division of the Third District sent a statement to the local court stating that Qiaoyun had been taken away by Xinglou and voluntarily withdrew the case. He was released yesterday. Unexpectedly, Bangchao has a cousin named Shen Fengzhu (thirty-five years old) who lives in the same house. His son, Hongxizi, nine years old, also disappeared on July 17th of this year. After searching everywhere without success, he heard of Xinglou's actions and suspected that he was also involved. After repeated strict investigation, they went to the house of someone surnamed Mou in Nanchujiaqiao, the French Concession, and found Hongxizi. At the same time, Xu Derong (fifty-three years old), an old man from Xinghua residing at No. 15 Youche Street, whose granddaughter had also disappeared the month before, also rushed to question him. Unexpectedly, Xinglou became angry and scolded Xu. Xu then called the police from the area to the First Division of the Third District. After a detailed interrogation by Station Chief Jin, he was charged with repeated kidnapping and immediately prepared a document to be sent to the court for verification.</p>

If you agree, please order your subordinates to pay attention and strictly enforce the ban. Director Yuan has ordered all his subordinates to comply.</p>

<p>Zhao's Heart is Too Cruel</p>
<p>Shao Xiao'di, a 28-year-old villager from Changzhou, has always made a living farming in his hometown. His wife, Zhao, is currently 27 years old. They have been married for over six years and have one child each year, all of whom are young. The couple's feelings were originally very harmonious. However, since nearly two years ago, Shao has neglected farming and devoted himself to wandering and gambling, resulting in a difficult life for his elderly mother and several family members. Zhao repeatedly tried to persuade her husband, but to no avail. Zhao then changed her mind and suddenly abandoned her husband and children in the first month of this year, secretly fleeing. Shao searched everywhere but could not find any trace of her. Subsequently, Shao's children cried incessantly, his elderly mother became depressed and ill, and his livelihood was on the verge of collapse. He regretted his actions but it was too late. Confined to his home, he soon developed a mental disorder, with suicidal thoughts frequently expressed in his words. Now, he suddenly received a report from a fellow villager stating that his wife, Zhao, had become involved with someone in Shanghai and was working in a Japanese-owned yarn factory. Shao borrowed money from relatives and came to Shanghai alone this month. Initially, he temporarily resided with a friend in the French Concession's Xiaobeimen area. Later, after learning that his wife was living in the western part of Shanghai, he went to the Chen family's residence in Rongqingli, Laobaosheng Road, in western Shanghai on Sunday to stay temporarily. He waited and searched in front of various Japanese yarn factories every day. Unexpectedly, at around 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, Shao was wandering near the Xiaoshadu inside and outside yarn factories when he saw his wife leaving the factory. Shao immediately grabbed her, but she was not panicked. She spoke gently and told her husband not to pull and tug. Since they had met, she said it was best to talk things over. Shao then released her and asked her to return home with him. Zhao repeatedly agreed. It was already dark. As the two walked to the entrance of Yinghuali, Zhao said, "Wait here for a moment while I go inside to get a bag of clothes." Shao stood there for a long time but did not see her come out. Knowing that she had planned to escape, he went inside and saw rows of houses. He asked everywhere but could not find her. From then on, he was dejected and developed a desire to end his life. He immediately went to a deserted area near his friend's residence, untied his belt, and hanged himself from a bamboo fence. Fortunately, a resident of the area saw him, cried out in alarm, and people rescued him. He was lucky that it had not been long and he was revived. He was then escorted back to his friend Chen's residence.</p>

<p>Order to Eliminate Superstition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order to its district offices yesterday, stating: "The Municipal Party Department has sent a letter stating that the Ninth District Branch has requested the Municipal Public Security Bureau to effectively ban shamans and Taibao in order to eliminate superstition and maintain the lives of the people. The central government has already issued a clear order prohibiting shamans and Taibao, giving them three months to change their professions. However, these people believe that their days are numbered, so they make false claims, saying they can see ghosts and cure diseases, and draw talismans to prolong life, which causes foolish men and women to listen attentively. Some even seek help from shamans and Taibao for their children's illnesses instead of seeking medical treatment, and hope for talismans to prolong life instead of medicine and treatment. The result is that they die in vain and regret it endlessly. Therefore, in view of this, please request the bureau to effectively ban them in order to break superstition, etc. Upon approval, it is hereby ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit them, and not to procrastinate or neglect responsibilities."</p>

The operating room was extremely busy, so the number of clothing staff and emergency service personnel was increased. A total of 2,654 X-rays were taken that year, 300 more than the previous year. The hospital spent a total of 70,000 yuan on the poor and sick that year. Most of these people suffered from acute illnesses and were sent by the patrol room, such as those injured by vehicles, suicides, bullet wounds, and beatings. The hospital is currently in need of empty medicine bottles, clean old clothes, toys, and other items needed by patients. It would be greatly appreciated if charitable people could donate to the hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Organization of Trade Associations <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to merchants in the city to organize trade associations in accordance with the law. The notice stated: "Article 7 of the amended Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that 'the term "trade without a trade association" refers to trades within the same region with fewer than seven businesses. When there are seven or more businesses, they may not join the Chamber of Commerce as businesses.' There are quite a few businesses in this city whose trades have seven or more businesses, but currently do not have a trade association. Their requests to join this Chamber of Commerce as business members cannot be accepted due to the restrictions of the regulations set by the Ministry. If this state of disunity continues, the common interests of the trades will inevitably not be guaranteed. In addition to this Chamber of Commerce sending personnel to investigate and urge them to organize trade associations, this notice is specially published to urge them to organize trade associations in accordance with the law and establish them within this year. If there are any ambiguities regarding the procedures for organizing a trade association, please go to the organization section of the commerce department of this Chamber of Commerce for guidance."</p>

<p>The anti-drug comrade associations organized by provinces, cities, and counties in the past have been reorganized into anti-drug propaganda associations by the Standing Committee of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association in order to facilitate propaganda and easily control the propaganda associations. The organizational content of the propaganda associations is simple and not prone to abuse. There are strict regulations on the reorganization steps and the scope of work that the propaganda associations should do. In addition to conducting on-site propaganda for the anti-drug movement, they are not allowed to interfere in other matters. At the beginning of the reorganization of the propaganda associations, the seventh National Anti-Drug Movement Week is being held. The association is taking this opportunity to observe the efforts and achievements of the anti-drug propaganda associations in various places in order to identify those who should be retained and those who should be eliminated, and to award prizes accordingly. In addition to notifying them to make efforts to contact party and political organs and groups to prepare for the event on the spot, it issued another notice yesterday asking the anti-drug propaganda associations that are being reorganized to pay attention. The notice is extracted as follows: "Over the years, many anti-drug comrade associations in various places have been well-run, but there are also many that have achieved little. In order to seek a close-knit organization and make long-term considerations, this association has decided to reorganize all anti-drug comrade associations and branches that have not been formally approved into anti-drug propaganda associations. At the time of the preparation for the seventh Anti-Drug Movement Week, we will first start to sort out the preparations for the reorganization, and hereby notify all national anti-drug groups to hold Anti-Drug Movement Week from October 1 to 7 (delayed for one week in remote provinces) in accordance with the previously promulgated plan, focusing on anti-drug propaganda, and submit a report to this association one week after the event. This will be used as the standard for identifying those who should be retained and those who should be eliminated. If there are other reasons, please report them separately. This matter is of great importance to the future of anti-drug efforts, so please do not delay and hinder the progress. All fees paid previously will continue to be valid. We hereby attach this notice. We hope you will take note of it. Chinese National Anti-Drug Association."</p>

<p>A fire broke out in the cloth room and machinery of the Tiānzhāng Paper Mill in Lùjiāzhái, Pǔdōng, at 1:10 PM yesterday. It was caused by a mechanic forgetting to add oil, which resulted in sparks igniting the cloth. Workers rushed to put out the fire, but it was already too intense and spread to the floorboards above. Workers upstairs panicked and fled down the ladder, but fortunately, they were not injured. The factory separately used telephones to alert the water and land authorities. Soon, a customs firefighting boat sailed to the factory's Bund, anchored, and connected a long hose to vigorously spray water into the burning room. It took about half an hour to extinguish the fire, but the floorboards were completely burned. Only the lead sheeting prevented objects from falling from above for the time being. Workers both upstairs and downstairs have temporarily stopped working.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</p>
<p>Yuè native Lǐ Yìmín falsely impersonated an official from the Public Works Bureau and suddenly went to the Xìnchéng Nánhuò Store at No. 440, Bàzǐ Road, on the first of this month. He claimed that the store's newly installed stove was too large and needed to be registered with the Public Works Bureau, otherwise it would be illegal and he would report it to the authorities. He then asked the store owner, Chén Yàotíng, for several hundred yuan to help him settle the matter. Chén refused and reported it to the Public Works Bureau. A foreigner told him that if he saw him again, he could report it to the nearest police station. Lǐ went to the store again the other day and said that a certain store on Wǔchāng Road had also asked him to find a way to settle the matter because of the large stove, and that it only cost 300 yuan. He said that if Chén continued to delay, he would inevitably be punished under Article 352 of the Criminal Code and the store would be sealed. At that time, Chén Yàotíng was out accounting, and Yú Qǐ, who came early, was informed by the store owner, so he was not fooled. He pretended to agree, and secretly sent someone to report to the police, who sent detectives to the store and arrested Lǐ. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for investigation. The police lawyer presented the forged letter written in Western language, which was found on the defendant. After questioning by Judge Féng, Lǐ was sentenced to three months in prison and the letter was confiscated.</p>

<p>The autumn harvest in Shànghǎi County this year is generally considered abundant, but the cotton harvest is slightly poor. The county has a total of six districts: (1) Mǐnháng, (2) Tángwān, (3) Běiqiáo, (4) Sānlín, (5) Chénháng, and (6) Mǎqiáo. In the first district of Mǐnháng, heavy rain and hail in the previous month caused the cotton buds that had already formed to be completely destroyed. Therefore, they replanted three times, and the last time they encountered rain, most of the cotton buds that had bloomed were blown off. The cotton buds that had not bloomed were damp for too long, causing them to mold and rot. Although the other districts were not destroyed by hail, the yield per mu was only about 30 catties. In terms of rice, the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts have about 60% to 70% of the harvest, which is enough for the farmers to survive the winter. The second district, Tángwān, has a higher terrain and a better harvest than other villages.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Li Yunliang Discusses Infringed Chinese Navigation Rights <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society was held in the auditorium of the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce at 9 AM on the day before yesterday (September 23rd). Mr. Li Yunliang, a local member with a master's degree, gave a public academic lecture on "Infringed Chinese Navigation Rights." Mr. Li has worked in the navigation industry for many years. This time, he elaborated in detail on the issue of Chinese navigation and the recovery of navigation rights. The following is a verbatim record of the speech by Mr. Xu Shishen from the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am an economics student who has been working in the shipping industry for the past few years and have paid relatively close attention to the issues in the industry. I have benefited greatly from following the colleagues of the Economic Society to your area to tour. I take this opportunity to talk to you about the issue of navigation rights, which is related to the survival of the nation. I dare not call this an academic lecture. The topic I will be discussing today is "Infringed Chinese Navigation Rights," which I will divide into four sections. The first is the state of Chinese shipping under foreign powers' infringement. The second is the process of losing navigation rights. The third is the impact of the infringement. The fourth is the method of recovering navigation rights. Transportation is the lifeblood of a country, and railways and ships are the two major tools of transportation. However, even now, our country only has 8,000 miles of railways. On average, every 100 square miles accounts for one-sixth of a mile, and 400,000 people have only one mile of railways. Of course, this is not enough for application. Therefore, most of the transportation now still relies on shipping. The foundation of shipping lies in the coast and rivers. China's coastline, from Dadonggou at the mouth of the Yalu River on the border between China and Korea in the north, passes through Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong to Beihai in the Gulf of Tonkin on the border between Guangdong and Saigon in southern Guangdong. It is a total of 13,000 miles. Compared with an area of ​​34.9 million square miles, every 2,600 square miles has only one mile of coastline. It is indeed very short. However, because the coastline is too short and there are relatively few harbors, we should pay special attention to protecting them. As for China's rivers, there are 12,000 miles that can be navigated by large ships and 34,000 miles that can be navigated by small ships, for a total of 46,000 miles. There are also 81,000 miles that can be navigated by civilian ships. Among them, the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and Heilongjiang River are the largest. In the north, the Heilongjiang River has 4,100 miles that can be navigated. In the south, the Pearl River has 1,800 miles that can be navigated. In the central area, the Yangtze River is one of the best rivers in the world and is China's treasure, with 4,900 miles navigable. There are also many tributaries, tens of thousands of miles, that can be navigated by small boats and civilian ships. Therefore, there are indeed many channels for China's shipping industry. However, over the years, due to the constraints of unequal treaties, navigation rights have been lost and foreigners have taken over. Now, foreign ships are even more developed than Chinese ships. China today has only 529 ships, totaling 400,000 tons. Calculated by population, each person only has two pounds and 1,000 people have only one ton. Taking a few of the most important companies as an example, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has 25 ships, totaling 56,000 tons, operating on the Yangtze River, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Minjiang, North and South Pacific routes, and has a history of 56 years. The wharves in various places occupy important areas, but because there are too few ships, there has not been much progress over the years. On the contrary, it is under the control of foreign merchants. The second largest company is Sanbei, with 22 ships, totaling 35,000 tons, operating on the Yangtze River, Ningbo, and Minjiang routes. The third is Zhengji Company, with 22 ships, about 27,000 tons, which is the mainstay of coastal shipping. Most of the ships sail to Andong, Dalian, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangdong. The remaining larger ones include the Northeast Shipping Bureau, which is the only shipping agency in the Northeast, operating on the Songhua River and Yalu River, competing with Russia and Japan for navigation rights. However, Heihe is still controlled by the Russians. Zhaoxing Company originated in Yingkou, with 9 ships, operating in Yingkou, Dalian, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places. Recently, it has also sent two or three ships to the Yangtze River and is acting as an agent for the shipping affairs of various small companies in the north. Ningshao Company has 4 ships operating in Ningbo and the Yangtze River and is a rising star. There are also many companies that are mostly less than 3,000 or 4,000 tons. Looking at the situation of China's shipping industry, although the number of ships is not small, most of the ships are too old (averaging 300-400 tons) and too old, so the coal consumption is high and the speed is slow, and they are not economical everywhere. Of course, it is not easy to compete. In recent years, due to military relations, the government often requisitions them, and they cannot operate normally, resulting in greater losses. Not only can they not progress, but they may not be able to maintain the status quo. Therefore, China's shipping industry is riddled with holes and is already on the verge of bankruptcy. Foreign ships operating on the Chinese coast, taking only the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Dalian four companies as examples, already have 161 ships totaling about 360,000 tons. Among them, the two British companies, Taikoo, account for 154,000 tons, and Jardine Matheson accounts for 98,000 tons. They occupy an advantageous position on the North and South Pacific and Yangtze River routes. The two Japanese companies, Nissin, have 50,000 tons and pay the most attention to the Yangtze River, and have ships sailing to Guangdong. Dalian, an affiliate of South Manchuria Railway, has 98,000 tons operating on Dalian, Qingdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other routes and is a strong force in the North Pacific. Recently, it has even expanded to the South Pacific and Hong Kong and Guangdong. The American-owned Jiangjiang Company specializes in sending shallow-water ships of less than 1,000 tons directly to Yichang and Chongqing, which is easy to operate and profitable and is a new force in the Yangtze River. Although I have not made detailed statistics of other companies, they probably total 200,000 tons. From this perspective, the power of foreign merchants is indeed more powerful than that of China's shipping industry. This year, there are about 70 million tons of ships in the world. The United Kingdom accounts for one-third, the United States accounts for one-fifth, and Japan accounts for one-twentieth. China's registered ships are only 320,000 tons, which is about four thousandths. Popularly scolding someone for being useless is "two hundred and five". Our country's shipping industry is less than "two hundred and five", only one two-hundred-and-fiftieth. It is obvious that China's shipping industry is controlled by the United Kingdom and Japan. Let's cite the customs statistics as proof. In the fifth year of Tongzhi (1864), there were a total of 6.6 million tons of shipping in and out throughout the year, and the United Kingdom actually accounted for half of it. Thirty years later, in the nineteenth year of Guangxu (1893), the tonnage of shipping increased to four and a half times, with 29 million tons. Foreign ships had 22,500 tons, and the United Kingdom accounted for 65% of the total, Japan 5%, and Chinese ships only 7 million tons, about 23%. More than 30 years later, last year, there were a total of 15,000 tons of ships in and out of the country. The British flag accounted for 37%, the Japanese flag accounted for 27%, and the Chinese flag only accounted for 23%. On average, there were 830 tons and 510 ships sailing every day, totaling 420,000 tons. Among them, the average foreign ship was 1,200 tons and there were 275 ships, totaling 340,000 tons. The average Chinese ship was 350 tons and there were 226 ships, totaling 80,000 tons. This is the general situation of Chinese and foreign shipping. Suzhou is not very developed in commerce. Among the 3,600 ships in and out of the customs last year, 900 were British and American ships, accounting for four-tenths of the total tonnage. Furthermore, in terms of inland port shipping, there are a total of 3,000 registered ships, but 550 of them fly foreign flags. Foreign ocean routes are completely controlled by foreign merchants. Except for the West Port and Hong Kong, our country does not have a single ton of shipping. From these many figures, it can be seen that China's shipping industry has been completely taken over by foreigners. Therefore, although the number of Chinese ships has gradually increased over the years, and on the surface it seems to have progressed, in reality it is just a painful history of the development of economic aggression by the powers on China's waters. The United Kingdom has a longer history of infringement and the greatest power. Japan is second, and other countries such as the United States, Norway, Germany, and France also have considerable power. They not only control our foreign ocean shipping, but also inland coastal, river, and port shipping has been infringed to the point of being incomplete. Everywhere, we only see the fluttering of foreign flags, coupled with the invasion of foreign warships into our country's territory, penetrating deep into the hinterland to show off their power. Anyone with blood would not be angry, if this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? How could this phenomenon have been created? (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>In the early morning, we boarded the South Manchuria train and continued northward.</p>
<p>The structure of the South Manchuria train is very beautiful. The third-class carriages can be compared with the second-class carriages of the Beijing-Shanghai train.</p>
<p>Looking out of the train window, the scenery is naturally that of the north. Snow-covered mountains and fields, clumps of gray empty forests, icy small rivers, and rows of short earthen houses with yellow smoke curling from their roofs... completely presenting a quiet and bleak atmosphere, much like an ancient beast left over from the Middle Ages, only sighing softly.</p>
<p>Especially the strangeness of those short earthen houses. The shape is like the carriages we are riding in, with slightly curved roofs, completely made of earth and mud, with very small window holes and smoke coming out of the roof because there is a heated kang inside. From these earthen houses, which are like Chinese-style coffins displayed one by one, we can imagine the simplicity of the lives of villagers in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The train passed through Fushun. From the train window, we could see a vague outline of this city outside the pass. It seemed that the houses were all the color of earthen red, and the entire city was filled with hazy yellow smoke.</p>
<p>At night, the train arrived in Changchun. Under the leadership of Mr. Chen, we stayed at an inn attached to the station. This inn is also very famous in Changchun, but inside it cannot make the travelers comfortable at all. Perhaps it is because I am not used to the life in the north. When you walk into the room, a large amount of water vapor gushes out, which will make you feel suffocated and difficult to breathe, as if you have walked into a public bathhouse.</p>
<p>We rested on a very large kang (?), which has been upgraded to not burn fire but use hot water pipes.</p>
<p>The people in this hotel are really too polite. From the tea boy to the handyman to the boss and manager (the northerners call them shopkeepers), and even the landlady, they all have to ask us how we are doing one by one, which really makes me overwhelmed. But I think this kind of hypocritical politeness only causes useless disturbance to the travelers.</p>
<p>The last leg of the journey from Changchun to Harbin was a solo trip for me.</p>
<p>The Chinese Eastern Railway train is obviously a contrast between a coarse and heavy one and a fine and small one. After the whistle made a piercing and strange cry, the heavy body of the train wriggled. In the cold night air, the train body seemed even heavier as it shook and rumbled, like a huge and elongated monster patrolling in the dark night.</p>
<p>As soon as I got on the train, I lay down and didn't know where the train had gone. I fell asleep, even though the train body was constantly shaking.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Returning Home <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>From this experience of returning to my hometown, I am firmly convinced that my hometown is still in a desolate and miserable state.</p>
<p>I imagined that this separation of seven years might give my hometown an opportunity to improve. So when I came back from a faraway place, a bright scene was brilliantly presented and everything would be like the rising sun. But I was disappointed. On the uneven and rugged road, I gazed blankly around. There was no touching architecture, nor was there any fresh creation. I thought, is this the hometown after seven years of separation? Originally, from observing from the side, I had already understood that my hometown had not improved in any way.</p>
<p>The people are still the same people. I met many old relatives. They welcomed me warmly.</p>
<p>"How strange, oh, the guest from afar!" So I was surrounded by them. They asked me this and that, and I was almost overwhelmed. Naturally, a lot of excitement and fun were added to my lonely environment. However, I always found it a little annoying to be entangled by them. What's the use? This just shows that the people in my hometown are seeing something new.</p>
<p>Several gentlemen who were not very old were bare-armed and held water pipes in their hands, quietly listening to me talk. Sometimes they would add a sentence or two, but no matter what, their faces were always full of surprise and doubt. It seemed that they agreed and it seemed that they opposed.</p>
<p>"This has a fresh meaning, but our age is too high," they said, squeezing their beards. I didn't feel anything about this, but when I spoke, I did deliberately pay attention. Around me were several girls. They had never talked to a male of their age, or sat silently with a male. I carefully observed them. Although they were restrained from fear and shame by my serious and generous aura, they still occasionally showed an unsatisfactory attitude.</p>
<p>"Why don't they want to seize the freedom they deserve?" I asked.</p>
<p>They smiled at each other - "The reason is something I don't know."</p>
<p>In fact, it was also beyond my expectation. I still thought that this important commercial port on the coast would inevitably eliminate all the old-fashioned obstacles that were not conducive to relations between the two sexes after years of being shocked by the new trend. But it wasn't. They told me how strict the local etiquette was and how women could not have any upper-class rights to act. In the general view, establishing a proper friendship between the two sexes is the most impersonal and shameful thing.</p>
<p>I ran into a person's house. The owner was my brother-in-law. When I saw this house, I was shocked, because the dilapidated and declining scene after years of disrepair was suggesting future anxiety. There was no place that was more complete. It was broken and tilted. Five families lived in this small house. The living room was unlike anything. There were only two incomplete tables. The meals in the morning, noon and evening were inevitably taken in turns by each family. There were so many children, mostly one to four or five years old, naked and crying all day long, turning into a world of crying. The male owner was as thin as a stick. When he was a little upset, he would beat the child severely, and the crying would get louder and louder. The women were better, but a kind of exhausted expression showed that they had no spirit of revitalization.</p>
<p>This is a bleak world. The streets are as quiet as if they are asleep, except for a few cries from hawkers. The citizens of the whole county seem to be in a dream. They are dazed with their eyes. Although there is a strong stimulus, it is useless and they are still sleeping. The old people have passed away. They admit that they have reached the time of the tomb and there is no need to do any more troublesome work. The middle-aged people repeated the words of the old people and thought that they had not had enough cultivation in their youth and were just having a temporary good time. The teenagers only knew how to move around in the dark hell. They thought that the broad and healthy avenue that had been opened up in front of them was a place of snake venom and did not bother to move forward.</p>
<p>"Is there no one coming out to take responsibility for the transformation?" I asked my cousin.</p>
<p>"This is not a superficial problem," my cousin replied. "If you only observe the metaphysical depravity, it is easy to find a solution. But this strange society seems to have the poison flowing into everyone's flesh. The stubborn minds drive them to only seek safety in a simple life every day. They are willing to do so. Yes, after laziness penetrates, it is impossible to remedy. So when you use new theories to instill, the result is just inexplicable."</p>
<p>My cousin's words were right. I wandered in the sad streets for more than ten days, looking every day at the dilapidated houses and the confused crowds. They would shout</p>
<p>"Hey, guest from afar, how are you? Thanks to God, we are all well."</p>
<p>But the guest from afar sadly plucked his zither.</p>
<p>The morning sun goes west, to the sea</p>
<p>I reside here, wide and vast</p>
<p>Welcome, travellers on board</p>
<p>Disappointed, my hometown will never change</p>
<p>The spirit that falls into a deep dream declines</p>
<p>You barren hill has been through seven years</p>
<p>When I looked at you before, you still had vitality</p>
<p>Now silently, like an ancient corpse</p>

<h3 id="e263">Nationalist Literary Criticism <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>Avant-Garde Weekly, Issues 11-13</p>
<p>Literary criticism has many varieties, because the objects of criticism differ in subject matter and method. For example, if the starting point of criticism is based on subject matter, dealing with historical facts is called historical criticism; dealing with various scientific or philosophical issues is called scientific criticism or philosophical criticism. Literary criticism (literary criticism) is naturally no exception to this scope, but it uses literature as the subject of criticism, that is to say, it uses literary works and issues as the object of criticism. Furthermore, if the goal of criticism is based on method, then criticism based on historical research methods is called historical criticism; criticism based on scientific principles and scientific research methods is called scientific criticism; criticism based on philosophical principles and research methods is naturally called philosophical criticism. Regarding this, the authors of Methods and Materials of Literary Criticism, Gayley and Scotts, once applied the perspective of criticism based on subject matter to literary works in the same way as mentioned above. In other words, criticism that uses literary works and issues as the object is called literary criticism (Literary criticism). But in terms of method, this "literary criticism" can be further divided into two types: judicial criticism and inductive criticism. In terms of schools of literary criticism, there are naturally many types. These schools of literary criticism arise with the schools of creation. Various methods of criticism, such as the so-called traditional criticism (Traditionlc</p>
<p>riticism) during the flourishing period of classicism (classicism), arose in response to these works. Other examples can be inferred based on this, without the need for further explanation. From this, it is sufficient to understand that criticism cannot be lacking when a certain kind of literature arises, and its importance in the literary category is of the same importance as other poetry or novels. Modern literary theorists say that literary criticism is also a kind of literary category. This statement has been established in European and American literary theories and is undoubtedly denied by literary foundations. In fact, literary criticism can also assist in the development of literary works. This involves the authors of literary criticism.</p>
<p>The prosperity of a nation's literature and art largely relies on the encouragement and guidance of literary critics. "The reason why Chinese literature and art have failed to embark on the correct path is certainly largely due to the lack of a correct central consciousness among literary authors, but at the same time, it is also an obvious fact that there are no literary critics who can grasp the correct central consciousness to guide them." From this perspective, literary critics are of utmost importance, especially in the Chinese literary world. Recently, amidst the surge of literary thought, our China has inevitably produced a kind of nationalist literature and art. In theory, it already has a definite foundation and is beyond doubt. However, during the gestation period of nationalist literary creation, nationalist literary critics must arise in response to creation. At the same time, there must be a correct assessment in critical judgments. Regarding this point, Mr. Xiang Hua's article "A Nationalist Literary Criticism" elaborates deep insights and establishes the judgments of literary critics. The new methods of nationalist literary creation can also be said to be the standards of nationalist literary criticism, which deserve special attention. The emergence of this article has a great influence on nationalist literary creation. Measuring the value of works according to this critical criterion can inevitably lead to outstanding progress in creations with a national center.</p>
<p>In "The Method of Nationalist Literary Criticism," the author explains the types of literary criticism produced in the past. By examining the essence of each type of literary criticism, the standards of its critical methods, and the roots of its diversity and disorder, it is clear that they mostly belong to the category of "mutual exclusion," and that no school of criticism has a perfect critical method, and that there is a lack of a central consciousness. Here, the author expresses a correct and precise judgment based on the results of his exploration: "What we need first is to be able to observe creation from the principles of nationalist literature and art. Furthermore, we must analyze whether the work is beneficial or harmful to the nation. At the same time, we must also consider the era and environment of the work, and pay attention to the perfection of its form and the richness of its content, and make a correct judgment that can never forget the standpoint of the group and be swayed by personal tastes, thereby repeating the mistakes of past individualistic literary criticism." This is the legal basis of nationalist literary criticism. Modern literary critics must base their estimates of the inherent value of nationalist literary creation on this principle in order to avoid all errors.</p>
<p>Before this methodology, the author examined "our current diverse and complex Chinese literary scene" with a precise eye. At the same time, he also explained that it is even more urgent to have literary critics with a correct central consciousness under such circumstances. During the period when nationalist literary creation is produced, just as Sainte-Beuve said, "A literary creator should have a literary critic to guide them." The same is true for nationalist literary creators. Secondly, the dissection of the Chinese people's lack of a spirit of criticism and their erroneous concepts is even more incisive and can be regarded as an extremely brilliant conclusion, for example:</p>
<p>Originally, the Chinese have always lacked a spirit of criticism, so all progress has been exceptionally slow. In literature, criticism is especially not valued. If we trace the remains of criticism in literary history, all we find is the general singing of "literature carries the Way" by corrupt scholars, or the mixing of Taoist thought and the playing of "spirit" and "qi." So it can be simply said that China has never had literary critics; those who exist are nothing more than executioners who harm literature and art.</p>
<p>This is such a shameful thing. Originally, the term "literary criticism" has only been gradually mentioned with the budding of new literature in recent years. As for the various guiding responsibilities of critics, whether they have been fulfilled and what the results of their efforts are, we are silent about it, but the author of this article also has detailed explanations and criticisms. As for the section "The Purpose of Nationalist Literary Criticism," it is also based on the outline of "The Purpose of a Literary Criticism" mentioned in "Methods and Materials of Literary Criticism" co-authored by Scott and Gayley, and it gives rise to "The Purpose of Nationalist Literary Criticism," which has nine points, that is, the critical criteria of literary criticism, which are worth noting.</p>
<p>Finally, the explanation of "The Current Task of Nationalist Literary Criticism" is extremely important. The author's argument is based on "The Purpose of Literary Criticism":</p>
<p>The current task of nationalist literature and art must never forget the national democratic spirit, absolutely support the literary creation of the general public, develop the nation's upward will, eliminate all thoughts that hinder national progress, and express the history of national struggle. In nationalist literary criticism, he must grasp his critical method, recognize his purpose and mission, and conduct a rigorous analysis and judgment of literary works. All works of feudal thought, decadent thought, and otherworldly thought, as well as those that wave the flag for Soviet Russia, harbor conspiracies to destroy the Chinese nation, and pro-labor works that seek to undermine national consciousness with class consciousness, should be eradicated with all their strength. At the same time, works that are in line with the purpose and mission of our nationalist literary criticism must be vigorously promoted, especially for new works and new writers, they should be supported with all their strength, guiding them with a correct central consciousness and guiding them to develop in this direction.</p>
<p>This is indeed a clear determination of "the current task of nationalist literary criticism," which no one can deny. In short, in the present day of constructing nationalist literary creation, such a non-empty grand theory from the author is urgently needed.</p>
