<h3>德政局新波瀾</h3>
<p>國家銀行總裁突辭職</p>
<p>各報議論　起</p>
<p>國會二讀楊格案</p>
<p>國民社七日柏林電今日德意志銀行</p>
<p>董事會議時、總裁沙樞博士忽以不贊成海牙會議最後議定書爲理由、宣吿辭職沙氏此舉、恍如向荆天棘地之政局中擲一炸彈、因其卸職後、必不甘静默、從事政治活動貫澈其主張也、</p>
<p>國民社七日柏林電德政界對於德意志銀行總裁沙樞博士突然辭職之動機與結果、議論纷起、惟銀行所發報吿、僅稱沙氏因不贊成海牙會議最後議定書、以故引退、而德政府公佈、亦祇證實沙氏之辭職、與否認將贈以巨額慰藉金之謡傳而已、德報則意見大殊、保守派報紙謂此舉益足見政府與黨之接受楊格計劃、未免忽視其經濟結果、反之自由派各報、則謂沙氏今日之辭職、乃日前在海牙反對國際銀行談判之天然結果、並料法理財家奎斯奈之辭去國際銀行總董、或將爲其最後變化、</p>
<p>國民社七日柏林電今日德國會二讀楊格案、財長摩登霍爾語及沙樞博士之辭職、極力否認政府曾施壓力於銀行之説、謂余對沙氏政治才能、雖另具見解、但認其確合總裁之職、故曾私人請其勿萌退志、至政府並無企圖削滅國家銀行及其總裁獨立權之意、外傳皆是謡諑、且沙氏此舉、益可爲政府等重其獨立權之明證、</p>
<p>路透社七日柏林電德國家銀行今日開董事會議、總裁沙赫脱（前譯沙樞）博士聲稱、渠已設法辭職、按沙赫脱任職合同、尚有數年期限、今未届期、遽行辭職、董事咸爲訝異、而銀行界與證券事場亦爲之震動、沙赫脱博士説明其解職原因、謂渠對於楊格計畫之態度、始終未變、自第二次海牙會議以來、亦未發生可使渠變更初意之事件、但總裁一席、未得替人以前、渠可暫留視事云、查沙赫脱博士去年十二月曾與德政府衝突、當時沙氏發表説帖、其文頗長、斥責政府不即整頓德國財政、並反對德政府及債權國政府增損楊格計畫中辦法之舉動、且聲明如有關係國不尊重楊格計畫中之辦法、則渠不負履行楊格計畫之責云、德政府旋答稱、財政部將在國會提出財政改良程序、</p>
<p>並請國會投信任票云、沙氏後以國會投信任政府票、遂聲明願接受德政府理財辦法、但終覺意見不投、故現有辭職之舉云、</p>

<p>日聯社七日倫敦電本日舉行之第一委員會、於關係制限外艦艇之日内瓦會議之恊定草案、加二項之修正、凡六百噸以下之艦艇全部及該當左記各項之六百噸以上二千噸以下之戰鬥用與非戰鬥用海軍船艦、均作爲制限外艦艇辦理、（甲）一、戰鬥用艦艇有六吋以下之砲者、一、有三吋以上之砲四尊以下者、一、無放射魚雷之設備者、一、速力在二十節（每小時行二十海里）以下者、（乙）一、無非戰鬥用裝甲者、一、無敷設機械水雷之設備者、一、無飛機着艦裝置者、一、飛機出發裝置合計不過二架者、一、雖有飛機射出裝置、而搭載飛機、不逾三架者、關於特種艦艇意見一致之點如左、一、爲國内徵税目的、而用快速武裝艦艇、一、使用射擊標的船、一、保存練習艦、定十一日下午四時四十五分再開第一委員會、</p>

<p>電通社七日倫敦電若槻史汀生兩首席全權、於本日午後三時半、在美國全權團宿舍之利資旅社會見、談至五時二十分、内容嚴守秘密據聞關於美國提案之大型巡洋艦建造、英已與美國以諒解、史汀生因特會見若槻、有所接受、</p>
<p>電通社七日倫敦電英首相本日语記者曰、軍縮會議大半四月中旬、可以閉會</p>
<p>電通社七日倫敦電據美國方面可靠消息、美國李逹全權向松平全權提示之新案六吋大型巡洋艦建造問題、英國初對此　有反對之意、後竟承該案係曰蘭地少將所提唱者、如得六吋大型巡洋艦、則八吋巡洋艦十五隻亦可、此係美國所表示者、但八吋巡洋艦減至十五隻、恐不能得上院之承認、結局美國之十八隻保有、將仍照舊保留、英國所以承認者、以美國之十八隻保有案、要僅權利而已、最少到一九三六年、可以限定爲十五隻、故與以諒解、即本日若槻史汀生之會見、史對若槻專求諒解此點無疑、惟日本全權態度、迄不明瞭、日美交涉、正達最高潮雙方全權之一舉一動、爲各國新聞記者團注視之的、又日本四全權於史汀生若槻會見後、午後六時半、集於若槻住室、恊議對美交涉、</p>

<h3>美國失業問題</h3>
<p>胡佛總統發表宣言</p>
<p>國民社華盛頓七日電胡佛總統今日發表一宣言、詆責一班人員藉失業爲口實、以與政府方爲難、謂此次失業之情形、其重要較一九○七與一九二二年時僅及二分之一或三分之一、故至多六十日至三十日、即可安渡難關、據商部及勞工部之報告、失業狀况之最劇烈者、不外十二州、他處則均係受暫潮流影響、本人所主張之全國建築大計劃、實爲補救失業之唯一良策、且關係建築無論何種房屋、目下儘有現欵放出、取息則較市爲低、故總現下之一切趨勢觀之、失業之災、不久可無形消滅、加以各界一致襄助政府挽回此不幸、故殊無用杞憂爲也、</p>

<p>羅塞米埃子爵之意見</p>
<p>路透社七日倫敦電與庇佛白羅克爵士發起帝國統一黨之羅塞米埃子爵、今日發表一文、在報紙披露、言帝國統一黨之事業、謂國人入黨者有十七萬三千人、該黨目的之一、現已逹到、即保守黨已正式採納其所主張之帝國自由貿易政策、但該黨工作不因一個目的之逹到而遂中止、仍將竭其全力、以期實現其他四個目的、其中較帝國自由貿易更爲重要者、至少有三、所謂其他目的者、即（一）立即對於各種製造品徵收高率進口税、而對於農業、予以充分津貼、（二）積極的减政、（三）對印度不再讓步、（四）對俄政府絶交、渠希望、保守黨採用帝國統一黨之全部政黨、以免有對抗之必要云、另一發起人庇佛白羅克爵士見此文後、聲稱、羅塞米埃子爵之意見、與帝國統一黨之原來目的完全不同、羅子爵現儘可自由發展其個人政見、渠雖與羅私交不易、然未便附和云、帝國統一黨基本金保管員現宣佈已决定將所有捐欵全部退還原主、</p>

<p>我嘗於前日滬江金陵球戰紀中謂金陵球員資質均佳惟患在動作緩慢、昨日表演、較前大佳、進退迅速内外一致於是東吳受其控制以致失敗正將五人、各有勳績詢一人才平均之球隊也</p>
<h3>東吳陣勢疏散</h3>
<p>東吳球隊、集合蘇滬二校好手而成、惟雙方素無會合訓練之機會宜乎各自爲政而無合作之可能就各個成績論其中數人亦可與金陵並駕齊驅、故在最初十分鐘時雙方累次平數、相持不下堪稱勢均力敵旗鼓相當迨至陣勢疏散、乃一敗不可收拾矣</p>
<h3>雙方劇戰經過</h3>
<p>金陵先下强手一鼓作氣凃鐘琦李造二人、先後力功東吳奮發有爲前鋒三人左右環進不久造成五五平數雙方分數似在水平線上同時進展、東吳雖每能先人一著、但金陵如影逐形緊隨於後、忽而東吳内外紛亂、陣勢疏散金陵乘此大進分數扶摇直上、越居於前上半時金陵二十三東吳十七、再戰聲中東吳首先獲分精神一振惟是烏合之軍多抱自私心理東吳安能避免大好機會每多錯過因此金陵勢盛時見大軍壓境、出其敏捷手腕、展其合作工夫、多方取奪不遺餘力、然東吳有時亦憑各固實力、相與周旋故雖受挫相差尙近、比賽結果、四十八比二十八、金陵勝、</p>

<h3>中日關税交涉昨午繼續開議</h3>
<p>定明晨再召集會議後</p>
<p>中日關税全部可議定</p>
<p>選定互惠貨品恊商中</p>
<p>中日關税交涉、昨日下午三時三十分、繼續在情報處舉行會議、列席者、我方爲外交部長王正廷·財政部長宋子文·歐美司司長徐謨、日方爲日本代理公使重光葵·書記官堀内干城·横竹商務官·議至七時十五分、始行散會、茲將會議經過、詳誌於下、</p>
<p>互惠貨品　昨日所討論者、仍關於互惠貨品之選定、將前日所議定之各條、加以整理、及修改文字、互惠品之種類、凡關於奢侈品等均不列入主要部份爲棉紗等數種、日方最初提議時、多至數百種、經我方一再抗爭、現已减至數十種、我方仍刀持須　爲縮减、大約最低限度爲十種至二十種、然對於中日關税恊定之全體、經昨日之磋商、雙方意見已歸一致、正式解决之期、業已不遠、</p>
<p>明晨續議　會散後、王正廷氏語本報記者云、本日會議、較前已大月進步、對互惠貨品選定問題、　在本會内解决、不再交專門委員會辦理、定十日晨、仍在此處繼續討論、預料彼時、當可將中日關税恊定全部議定、告一段落、俟重光請示日政府核准後、即可正式簽字、</p>
<p>互址税率　王氏又謂、外傳互惠税率、與迭次向日方所討論者、意義微有不同、所謂互惠税率者、即在特定互惠貨品範圍以内、應减納關税若干、但現在所討論中日關税恊定中、所謂互惠貨品、並非减納關税、乃特定一種税率、兩國共同遵守云云、</p>
<p>財宋談話　財政部長宋子文、昨語本報記者云、本日所討論之各點、雙方意見已漸趨一致、至互惠税率、英美亦有此項恊定、不足爲奇、各國亦决不至援例要求、日本因未簽定關税自主、故情形亦微有不同、在互惠税率實質上言、日本似較各國稍佔便宜、互惠貨品、我方力主竭力縮减、尙在恊議中、記者又詢以新税則何日實行、據答、據最近海關統計、進口貨品税减、故新税則之實行、尙須加以考慮云云、</p>

<p>來賓演説　陳德徵代表許性初演説、略謂、今日時間未到到會者已甚衆可見各位熱心婦運、過去婦運有許多弱點、第一爲祇注重於上層婦女而忽略下層階級的勞動婦女、第二、爲祇注重個人活動、而忘記婦女羣衆普遍利益、第三爲祇注意外面社會活動、而忘記了家庭内部重要工作、從此三點、可以歸結到此後婦女運動之出路、最重要的、爲（一）　受中國國民黨的領導、（二）注重下層勞動婦女的實際解放（三）注重女子敎育之普遍的擴大（四）注重女子經濟生活共同的獲得獨立未又對現在之家庭生活痛下針、希望頭腦清新之婦女、能自已加意修養、增進家庭生活、並注重婦女本身思想解放與軀體解放、希望生活合理化、及提倡（天乳）運動、此外尙有市政府代表陳克成、一區黨部代表朱樹鑑、相繼演説、詞長從略</p>

<p>黨部代表訓詞　市執委會代表潘公展致訓詞、略謂、世界的婦女、自從一九零九年的三月八日以來已逐漸開始解放了、中國的婦女、因在中國國民黨的領導之下、同樣地開始解放了、雖然不能澈底的解放但是已經逐漸在趨向解放之路上、這是事實、譬如關於法律的女子承繼財產權等已實行了婦女如其要澈底的解放自然必須要婦女自已起來、繼續努力、並且中國婦女應當注意就是中國的婦女運動·與中國民族解放運動的國民革命運動、有相連的關係、中國的革命成功、即中國婦女的解放、所以中國的婦女、應當與全體民衆、共同致力於國民革命、其次就是婦女解放的先决問題、便是敎育問題因爲經濟獨立等、完全基於婦女受充分的敎育、和有充分的智能云云、次由市民訓會代表許也夫訓詞、（從略）</p>

<h3>大夏敎授馬博士珍聞</h3>
<p>— 許晚成</p>
<p>前任工商部敎育部司法部長暨北平國立工業大學上海大夏大學校長。現任大夏敎授馬君武博士。廣西桂林人。名振學界。聞人也。大夏大學有此成績。博士實有大功焉。</p>
<p>博士在日留學時。艱苦卓絶。簞食瓢飲。而勤讀不輟。致病肺近視。百病叢生。後赴德留學。注意衛生。始獲健全。博士學問淵博。皆從刻苦勤習中得來。中國人而得德國博士學位者。馬爲第一人。</p>
<p>博士闪前在平任司法部長。其母對曰。「任司法部長。恐多寃屈事。造孼堪憂。」故爲時近十日。博士遽爾引退。聞者異之。不知其皆因老母之一言也。</p>
<p>博士現在大夏講授「經濟政策上之幾個重要問題。」與「學術與思想」兩學程。按時講授。循循善誘。從無缺課。聽者满座。其得學生信仰可知。</p>
<p>博士工書法。字體奇偉。獨樹一幟。課</p>
<p>餘辄爲學生揮毫潑墨。得者珍之。博士自謂「課外作業」云。</p>
<p>博士之名。謂與英國「逹爾文」！！（譯名）相巧對蓋「逹」字可作羔羊解也。亦云趣矣。</p>
<p>博士隱居寳山楊行鄉。有良田七十六畝。敎讀之餘。耕作其間。怡然自樂。頗有不知有漢。無論魏晋之概。前年夏。歐副校長。因公往謁。親見博士戴笠赤足。持锄墾植云。蓋博士淡名利。務實學。超然塵世。游諸物外。前雖任國内要職。仍兩袖淸風。無有積储。布衣蔬食。不减當年境况。聞去春長公子赴美留學。一切費用。借貸他人。并與質補湊云。其廉潔之風。於此可見。</p>
<h3>從劇旨歌説到璇宫豓史</h3>
<p>— 劉碩甫</p>
<p>記得近來的影片。情節稍佳的。都有一種題旨歌。如「雷夢娜」。「安琪兒」等。風行一時。差不多什麽人都會唱。一年裹出版多少新影片。就平添多少新歌曲。自然這許多歌曲不見得曲曲都好。但是十分曼妙的。却也着實很多。我所喜歡的。如「紅皮膚」。「天堂」。「我夢中的莎梨。」「羅曼麗。」等等。雖然是小結構的歌曲。却是很動聽。我想也許是多數人。以爲影片必須配以優美的音樂。舊有的老譜音樂。人所熟知。拿來配合新出的影片。一來時代不相合。二來戲情不相合。看的人聽了。總不免有些感覺到陳腐。所以題旨歌之受人歡迎。也是電影與音樂不能分離的一種證明。至於説到有聲電影。原來也有人不贊成。他説影戲本有一種幽默的趣味。一到了人人説話。豈不失了影戲的眞趣。但是我的意見。覺得有聲影片。也有它的優點。因爲現在的有聲影片。大致是分類。一類是純粹歌舞的如「百老匯之歌舞」。「羣芳大會」「明星大集會」等。是把新編的歌曲。加以跳舞。再稍爲配上一點情節。看了那些酣歌軟舞。彷彿到了百老匯的舞臺一様。一類是有很好的劇本。而劇材方面。又恰有可以加入音樂歌唱的地方。於是便特意編成一種題旨歌如「可泣可歌」中的「小兒子」等曲。「歌塲孝子」中的慈母曲。「紅豆相思」中的「我夢中的莎梨」等等。都是劇以歌名。歌以劇傳的。一類是關於殺人犯法的案件。利用聲音。來表現行兇時的慘怖。和偵查時的語言形態。如「水落石出」「睡鞋之秘密」等。一類是將劇情中的時候唱出。如「麗娃栗妲」。「美人腿舞」等。都是此類。雖屬影戲。却不脱歌劇的原旨。各種有聲影片。要以這一類爲正宗。最近所看的「璇宫艷史」也是這一類。但是劇情。表演。聲音。方面。處處能予觀衆以十二分的满意。本劇大意。是説南美洲一個錫爾凡尼亞女主國。因派伯爵某人到法國去。後來伯爵因性喜拈花惹草。做出許多風流事來。以致貽誤公事而撤回。女王正在懷春之際。於是也愛上了這位風流伯爵。便下嫁於他。但是他們雖发戀愛而结婚。總免不了君臣的份際。伯爵却很不满意這種不自然的形式。便利用種種愛情上的手段。屈伏了這位望尊威大的女王。終於伉儷和好。共同當國。扮女王的名叫琪奈特麥克陶。原來是位舞臺優伶。伊的聲音的高亢淸越。和表演的細膩熨貼。可算獨絶。尤其伊飾女王態度的凝重而安詳。却是難能可貴。扮伯爵的是著有盛名的馬利司希佛利。神情活潑瀟洒。歌喉圓潤動聽。眞不愧大家叫他做「國際傀儡」。本劇</p>
<p>中有「歡唱歌」。「巴黎依舊」。「願生民間」。「喁喁曲」。「無人用之」。「夢裏情人」。「以娱皇后」。「行軍曲」。等歌。音調極爲和諧悦耳。再末了一句話。就是本劇是劉别謙導演的。凡是此公導演的片子。都是無一處不精警。從頭到尾没有一點懈處。劇</p>
<p>情好。演員好。歌曲好。還有什麽</p>
<p>再説的呢。</p>
<h3>美國人之健談</h3>
<p>— 國新</p>
<p>佔世界第一位</p>
<p>詩家谷通訊云。據施密流氏在無綫電話改良會所發表之談話計算。謂全球各國。以美國人爲最喜談天。施氏曾將各國毎年所用電話之次數造成一比較表。按表。則談話之次數。最多者首推美國。雖將設有電話之各國。所用電話之次數。綜合計之尚不及美國通話次數之半。即此可知美人之健談矣。據施氏之表所統計。美國人民。常年通用電話之次數。共爲二百二十五萬次云。（二二五○○、○○○、○○○次、）</p>
<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>甲—一個人倘能遵守時間。自已决無損失。</p>
<p>乙—不過常須損失半小時。等候别一位不遵守時間的人。</p>
<p>主婦（向女僕）—這一個月中。你所打碎的碗盤已和你的工錢相抵了。以後該怎樣的防止這回事。</p>
<p>女僕—太太。只有　一個辦法。下個月把我的工錢加起來。那就抵不過了。</p>
<p>父—你今天爲甚麽回來得這般遲。　　子—先生留我在學堂中。不許我回來。　　父—爲甚麽事。　　子—完全是出於誤會罷了。　　父—怎樣的誤會。我可发給先生解釋。　　子—上地理課時。我把大西洋誤會做太平洋。</p>
<p>主人（向獃僕）—你到火車站去看。今天上蘇州去的夜班火車甚麽時候開。　　獃僕—好的。待我去看。過了六小時方始回來。　　主人—你怎　麽挨到這時候纔回來。　　獃僕—主人喚我看夜班火車甚麽時候開。所以我看它開了纔回來。</p>
<h3>最近之徐浦間交通情形</h3>
<p>— UB</p>
<p>自石部發生事變。津浦交通中斷者幾兩月餘。上月通車始恢復。愚於此一月中。數度往返徐浦間。故關於該路之交通情形。頗爲稔悉一二。記之以爲讀者告。</p>
<p>該路車輛無多。故乘客擁擠。尤不能按時到站。沿路停頓。名曰特别快車。實較普通慢車尤爲擔延。計由浦至徐祇七百餘里。長不及滬寗路線。而按車行時刻規定。已須十五小時。實際上則最速爲十六小時。最後則在二十四小時以上。普通俱在二十小時上下。一則兵車絡繹。二則沿途橋樑多毀壞。如沙河集橋。橋垜毀去後。僅以枕木堆疊河中。以略事支撑。車行非用最低度之速率以行進不可。此外又有一因。則據愚旅行經騐所得。站員之不負責。及辦事無方。尤爲最要之原因。愚等返浦之日。車停明光站不進者幾逹四小時。詢之車長則諉爲未發路簽。詢之站員則稱前站無信號。不能開行。然前站何以無信號至。則無人能言其故矣。乘客無不躁急萬狀。待至五小時後。見有三數鄉人自軌道中行來。有向詢前站情形者。據云渠等係乘北上車至前站。因橋壞不能進。捨車徒步云。此時站長亦接到電話。謂橋壞須俟修復始能開行云。站長宣佈後不逾半小時。北上車忽至站。與余等　南來車交錯而過。僉就來車詢問橋壞已否修復。則據來車負責人員稱。橋壞之事爲莫須有。祇以渠等久停前站。係余等之北來車不至。故冒險逕開。不料渠等在前站候我車之際。即我車在明光候彼車之時。兩方互相等候。兩方俱不至。倘非彼車開來。則吾等雖待至明年。尚未開行云。</p>
<p>徐浦三等價六元八角。較滬寗昂一倍餘。而路線較滬寗短百餘里。</p>
<p>徐浦之三等車。窗門殘缺。冷氣侵入。不但無煖氣管。且無電燈。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一四四）</h3>

<h3>南洋游記（一）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>十九年二月八號。從上海外虹橋招商總局上法郵船GeneralMetinger梅辛格將軍。重一萬六千噸。李師母雲陜送行。劉仁宣劉士木均上船。尚有黄警頑郎靜山張明慈等。以時間未及到船爲憾。</p>
<p>九點半開向香港。風平浪靜。同行張煊君。（俞人廣東大埔人）老革命而學佛。願同到南洋宣傳。遇一缅甸商。云在缅華僑十餘萬人。英政府待遇頗好。並不虐待。其在缅營玉石數世矣。彼家滬。一年去一次。缅距雲南甚近。惜不交通。須繞新加坡方到。言缅女爲主。男爲客。女可休夫。如中國之休妻。佛敎盛。僧權大。供養僧用肉。過午不食。入寺脱鞋。曾有一英爵士謁僧。堅不脱鞋。以刀砍其首。避刀乃削去其鼻。致千萬人與英政府抗。乃已。愚謂缅俗可謂自然坤化矣。南人云。缅以信佛敬女。男弱不能革命。故難與英爭。然近有僧人握字氏通英法語文。屢謀抗英。下獄數次。今聞往俄云。其弱男之策。乃大同法。若國爭則不適。有國在却須以女和男。不必弱之也。　　十號過廈門。問談商人終日講基督敎。同人半。揶揄之。余念今後宗敎價値。已不如社會科學之重要。若欲保存之。必須采社會科學納入其中。方免淘汰。否則只可自慰。與社會無益矣。</p>

<p>美棉狂跌之原因</p>
<p>新棉田縮减無切實發展</p>
<p>世界美棉銷費估計减少</p>
<p>出口少需求淡疋頭仍呆</p>
<p>農務局之援助仍有所待</p>
<p>廠商套賣多頭失望了结</p>
<p>但期貨實際地位有進步</p>
<p>七日紐約電告一週間之棉市狀况云、新棉田是否將有充分縮减、人心不能無疑、加以美棉世界氏銷費數有估計較小之趨勢、農務局須俟棉田問題解决後、始可予以積極援助之説、現漸爲人所信、積此數因、賣風乃大熾、本週五月期棉價每磅竟跌至一角四分半之下、此外尚有促起賣風之一原因、即一般物價不爲人信任是也、棉價落、則同業與空頭吸收賣出、但價漲則需求欲</p>
<p>跡、農務局業於棉市之政策、未聞有何變動、棉田景象亦無切實之發展、但有若干方面、以棉田頗佳、植棉籌備與平時無甚差異、期貨之實際上地位、現已大有進步云</p>
<p>又孔、多方未　了结、　期　實其所有之棉貨與棉花、出口不多、　　　實料减　、　内疋轉交易進　、現棉需求不冷淡、政府機關之意思依然未定云云、附錄週末統計如左、（單位千包）　　　　　　　　　　　前週　　　　　上週</p>

<p>糧食河下米市上漲</p>
<p>閘北昨日各帮到貨陸續、河下存積在三百號以上、本街消化甚殷、惟貨客因内地産區有禁運之訊、而本埠市價、在陰雨前兩市頗有修削、本因産價堅昂、成本加重、遂一致扳售、非增漲不脱、於是各店方如存貨不充而亟須添辦者、勢必放盤、是以北粳上午見漲兩角之譜、半貨船底約堤一角、薄稻則隋粳而向榮、但銷路有限、羊杜埠秈則轉挺定之局、大盤續加半元、白元平穩、雖有少數賣户喊高、然買方無意加價、交易欠爽、</p>
<p>滬南河下來船見接、走銷平平、常錫北粳買氣不旺、無北市之俏式、行情略好近角、蘇同白粳仍呆定、鄉莊胃口不暢、價徵升而已、南帮薄早稻河存轉稀、來貨不多、市盤向上角左、羊秈趨穩、惟杜秈因有客帮採購步緊、通變陰化今亦覺活、吊坊與客户均動、數雖不多、市則見佳、</p>
<p>遠月粉傾向下游</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午各月份呈近穩遠疲之局、本月份因實銷尚形活動、故人心頗穩、遠期則以洋麥報價、又見徵小二角左右、且一般外行投機多頭、鑒於上月份之狂跌、差度遠一錢外、此時若再根據小麥之不豐、儘力購買抬高、則意外之風波、彷彿或須發生、故局勢雖大致看高、而落手者則甚寂寞、固此市面反見下勢、六月份以下之新粉、因天氣已佳、人心亦軟、结果本月份不動、四月份小五厘、五月份小一分二厘半、七月份小七厘半、七月份小七厘半、八月份小一分云、</p>
<p>環境造成之麥市軟狀</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午各月份市面、因洋麥及報價微小、更以日來長江及江北一帶、雖不能謂爲旺盛、但確亦陸續到埠、且三四月份之需要、除廠家外、餘若行家及客家、均不敢囤積、故交易所市塲、如廠家不動、市面即呈不穩、要亦事實上所不得已也、結果本月份小三分、四月份小二分、六月份小三分、七八月份各小四分、現貨市面、以廠家辦胃又多觀望、商貨以變方意不接近、昨無見交、祇中次貨略有交易、惟市値已無形中小去二三分矣、開沙市麥五兩零一分、安慶麥五兩一錢、鎭江麥五兩零七分、計一千包、由阜豐辦去云、</p>
<p>南北貨泡圓昨由泉裝出</p>
<p>泉州大泡桂圓、自上月中旬開過後、迄今尚無續到、市上各行存底除二三家手貨較多外、餘均斷缺、然有貨者恃有前進低價貨、售盤仍未照增、不過號盤已爲抬高、致地價頓升五六元、超出申市之上、倒懸局勢已成、昨據電訊、地頭已裝出、不日即可到申云、</p>
<p>疋頭條子色汀趨勢轉硬</p>
<p>疋頭交易、昨因久雨乍晴、加以時局轉機、人心活動、東貨之條子色汀俱漲二釐半、莫干山大得利均開一錢、、七分二釐半、紫巾山新條一錢七分、孝得實·紫巾山·寒山寺一致售一錢六分七</p>
<p>釐半、兒孫福仍一錢六分二釐半至六分半、惟新花因到貨日多、走銷已不若以前之暢、形勢較軟、昨大得利格子售二錢一分至一錢九分、訪友圖二錢餘者自一錢八分半至二錢、前售之二錢二三分之貨、絶鮮走動矣、客銷川帮仍有添辦、成交細嚜嘰、冲花羽綢·毛絲布等百餘件、長沙·江西等帮略形見靜、本街昨在公會進三百餘件、就中西貨亦不少、素府綢秃白安福貨開四錢五分半、安利貨四兩六分、裁記五錢二分半、均有成交云、</p>
<p>雜訉函館電、干具因銷滯呆、各檔市價轉跌五六元、</p>
<p>港電金山蝦尾産市跌五元、後船有一百十件裝途、</p>
<p>紐約義絲市價因受銀市滯鈍之影響、毎磅傾跌一二角、</p>
<p>怡和昨進滬白廠經廿包、開利進中身魯黄廠經二十包、中和進白乾經十包、</p>
<p>糖業公會　盤、昨已轉穩、即行售南規價格、亦略形扳高、不若先前之貶價待售、</p>
<p>大連豆市急轉直下、因東省官銀號將大批多項出售、連日運申之貨甚湧、本埠平格連元昨又回下近　、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Colonies of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Every nation that has ever established a state, once it loses its nation and becomes a colony of another country, if its people are not completely ignorant, will have the concept of establishing an independent state. No matter how oppressed or restrained, it cannot stop the tide of independence.</p>
<p>Looking at recent times, Annam under French rule, Korea under Japanese rule, Fiji under American rule, and India under British rule have all experienced acts of resistance. If the concept of national independence is not born, then it is over. Once this idea is born, who in the country would not be willing to be loyal to their motherland and escape the restraints of other countries? Therefore, no matter how a country handles its colonies, whether it uses gentle or harsh methods, it cannot defeat the love of the colonists for their motherland.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when a force is at its peak, any opposition is ineffective. But when it declines, it cannot even maintain its position. Before the European War, the forces of imperialism were at their peak. As a result, small and weak countries were often annexed by the strong and became colonies of the strong. When the power of imperialism was broken by the European War, the oppressed people of the colonies naturally rose up in response. Although it has not yet reached the point of complete liberation, the trend of it getting closer day by day is clearly visible. Therefore, the resistance in colonies is just beginning and will definitely not stop here. Therefore, today, the</p>
<p>the colonial question, along with the unemployment question, are things that major powers hesitate about and can do nothing about.</p>

<h3>New Waves in German Politics</h3>
<p>Sudden Resignation of the President of the National Bank</p>
<p>Newspaper Discussions Commence</p>
<p>Second Reading of the Young Plan in Parliament</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, National News Agency - During today's board meeting of the Deutsche Bank, President Dr. Schacht abruptly announced his resignation, citing his disapproval of the final protocol of the Hague Conference as the reason. This move by Schacht is like throwing a bomb into the thorny political situation, as he will certainly not remain silent after leaving office, but will engage in political activities to implement his ideas.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, National News Agency - In German political circles, discussions have erupted regarding the motives and consequences of the sudden resignation of Dr. Schacht, President of the Deutsche Bank. However, the bank's announcement only stated that Schacht resigned because he disagreed with the final protocol of the Hague Conference. The German government's announcement also only confirmed Schacht's resignation and denied rumors of a large severance payment. German newspapers have widely divergent opinions. Conservative newspapers say this move further demonstrates that the government and the party, in accepting the Young Plan, have neglected its economic consequences. On the other hand, liberal newspapers say Schacht's resignation today is a natural result of his opposition to international banking negotiations at The Hague, and they expect the resignation of Quesnay, the French financial expert, as the last development.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, National News Agency - Today, the German Parliament held the second reading of the Young Plan. Finance Minister Moldenhauer spoke about Dr. Schacht's resignation, strongly denying that the government had put pressure on the bank. He said that although he has different views on Schacht's political abilities, he believes that Schacht is indeed suitable for the position of president, so he had privately asked him not to consider resigning. The government has no intention of diminishing the independence of the National Bank and its president, and all rumors are false. Moreover, Schacht's move is further proof of the government's respect for its independence.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, Reuters - The German National Bank held a board meeting today, and President Dr. Schacht (formerly translated as Sha Shu) stated that he had taken steps to resign. According to Schacht's employment contract, there are still several years left, but he resigned before the term, which surprised the board members, and the banking and securities markets were also shaken. Dr. Schacht explained the reasons for his resignation, saying that his attitude towards the Young Plan has never changed, and no event has occurred since the Second Hague Conference that could make him change his initial intention. However, he can stay in office temporarily until a replacement for the president is found. It is noted that Dr. Schacht had a conflict with the German government last December. At that time, Schacht issued a long statement criticizing the government for not immediately reforming German finances and opposing the German government and creditor governments from adding or subtracting methods in the Young Plan, and stated that if the related countries do not respect the methods in the Young Plan, he will not be responsible for fulfilling the Young Plan. The German government then replied that the Ministry of Finance would submit a financial reform program to the Parliament and ask the Parliament to vote for confidence. Schacht then stated that he was willing to accept the German government's financial management methods because the Parliament voted for the government's confidence, but he ultimately felt that his opinions were not aligned, so he has now resigned.</p>
<h3>Plenary Session of the London Conference</h3>
<p>Discussing the Report of the First Committee</p>
<p>All Representatives are Optimistic about the Future</p>
<p>Top-Level Talks Between the US and Japan</p>
<p>The Contents are Kept Strictly Confidential</p>
<p>The Conference will Conclude in Mid-April</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Reuters - This morning, the chief representatives of various countries gathered at St. James's Palace for two hours to discuss the report of the First Committee on general issues. British Prime Minister MacDonald later told reporters that he was confident that the Five-Power Naval Conference would definitely conclude a clear treaty based on the Five Powers, around April 14th, before the budget day. The British Prime Minister refuted the claim that the Naval Conference had fallen into the hands of naval officers, and said that the treaty to be concluded in the future must contain a concrete procedure for representatives to engage in practical research. All representatives are now optimistic about the Naval Conference. The British side believes that there will be no more battleships built before 1936, which is now undoubted.</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Japan Allied Press - The First Committee, held today, added two amendments to the draft agreement of the Geneva Conference on the restriction of non-restricted warships. All warships below 600 tons and naval vessels for combat and non-combat purposes between 600 tons and 2,000 tons that meet the following requirements shall be treated as non-restricted warships: (A) 1. Combat warships with cannons below 6 inches; 1. Those with no more than four cannons of 3 inches or more; 1. Those without torpedo launching equipment; 1. Those with a speed of 20 knots (20 nautical miles per hour) or less. (B) 1. Those without non-combat armor; 1. Those without equipment for laying mechanical mines; 1. Those without aircraft landing devices; 1. Those with no more than two aircraft launching devices in total; 1. Even if there is an aircraft launching device, the aircraft carried shall not exceed three. The points of consensus on special warships are as follows: 1. Fast armed warships used for domestic taxation purposes; 1. Using shooting target ships; 1. Preserving training ships. The First Committee will reconvene at 4:45 p.m. on the 11th.</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Electric Communications Agency - The plenary session of the chief representatives of various countries convened at 12:45 p.m. today. After approving the matters decided by the First Committee submitted to the special committee, they exchanged opinions on the unresolved issue of the single-ship tonnage limit for light cruisers. Various countries had considerable discussions but could not reach an agreement. As a result, it was decided to instruct the First Committee to conduct further research. At the same time, regarding the essential issue of the actual numbers of holdings of various types of warships, countries must seek to approach opinions as soon as possible. After the meeting, Wakatsuki told reporters that the meeting lasted almost one hour, and in general, the issue of the maximum single-ship tonnage of light cruisers was discussed, with various opinions and arguments, but there were no results.</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Electric Communications Agency - Wakatsuki and Stimson, the chief plenipotentiaries of Japan and the United States, met at the Ritz Hotel in the dormitory of the US plenipotentiary delegation at 3:30 p.m. today, and talked until 5:20 p.m. The contents are kept strictly confidential. It is rumored that Britain has reached an understanding with the United States regarding the US proposal for the construction of large cruisers. Stimson specially met with Wakatsuki to seek acceptance.</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Electric Communications Agency - The British Prime Minister told reporters today that the disarmament conference could be closed in mid-April for the most part.</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Electric Communications Agency - According to reliable sources in the United States, the new proposal for the construction of 6-inch large cruisers presented by US plenipotentiary Reed to Japanese plenipotentiary Matsudaira initially met with opposition from Britain, but later Britain admitted that the plan was advocated by Admiral Jellicoe. If 6-inch large cruisers are obtained, then 15 8-inch cruisers can also be obtained. This is what the United States has indicated. However, reducing 8-inch cruisers to 15 may not be approved by the Senate. In the end, the US holding of 18 ships will remain the same. The reason why Britain has agreed is that the US holding of 18 ships is only a right, and at least until 1936, it can be limited to 15 ships, so an understanding has been reached. That is, at today's meeting between Wakatsuki and Stimson, Stimson specifically sought Wakatsuki's understanding on this point without a doubt. However, the attitude of the Japanese plenipotentiaries remains unclear. The negotiations between Japan and the United States have reached a climax. The actions of the two plenipotentiaries are the focus of attention of the news media from various countries. Also, after the meeting between Stimson and Wakatsuki, the four Japanese plenipotentiaries gathered at Wakatsuki's residence at 6:30 p.m. to discuss the negotiations with the United States.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Designates March 8th</h3>
<p>Civilian Peaceful Strike</p>
<p>Patel Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</p>
<p>This Move is to Celebrate Patel's Imprisonment</p>
<p>Bombay, July 7th, Reuters - Patel, the brother of the Speaker of the Indian Legislative Assembly, a leader of the National Party, and an important figure under Gandhi, was sentenced to three months in prison and fined 500 rupees today for disobeying the government's ban on public speeches. If he does not pay the fine, he will be imprisoned for another three weeks. After receiving a telegram that Patel had been detained, Gandhi declared that such news should be very welcome. He also said that he could change his plan to send the first batch of volunteers, just as he could issue an order to depart tomorrow or Sunday. Gandhi today asked all factory owners, factory workers, shopkeepers, partners, and all civilians to make March 8th a day of peaceful and complete strike to celebrate the imprisonment of the uncrowned monarch of Gujarat (referring to Patel).</p>

<h3>League of Nations Health Committee</h3>
<p>Passed Two Resolutions</p>
<p>Both Related to China</p>
<p>Geneva, July 7th, Reuters - The Health Committee of the League of Nations has completed its study of the Chinese government's proposal to work with the League's health organization today, and passed two resolutions. The first article is related to the joint work on public health requested by the Chinese government, and the second article is related to the quarantine of ships at Chinese ports. Dr. Yan, Director of the Medical Administration Department of the Chinese Ministry of Health, thanked the Health Committee of the League of Nations for its careful study of the Chinese government's proposal, and stated that the joint work to be established between China and the League of Nations will definitely be close and effective.</p>
<h3>US Unemployment Problem</h3>
<p>President Hoover Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Washington, July 7th, National News Agency - President Hoover issued a statement today, criticizing a group of people for using unemployment as an excuse to make things difficult for the government, saying that the importance of this unemployment situation is only one-half or one-third of that in 1907 and 1922, so at most 60 to 30 days, the difficult situation can be safely overcome. According to reports from the Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor, the most severe unemployment situation is in no more than twelve states, while other places are all affected by temporary trends. The national construction plan I advocate is the only good strategy to remedy unemployment, and regardless of the type of construction involved, there is currently cash available for disbursement, and the interest rate is lower than the market rate, so from the current trends, the disaster of unemployment will soon disappear invisibly, and with the unanimous assistance of all sectors to the government to save this misfortune, there is no need to worry about it.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Advocates</h3>
<p>Negotiating an Opium Agreement</p>
<p>Criticizes Britain for Holding Opium Monopoly</p>
<p>Plans to Authorize President Hoover to Convene a Conference</p>
<p>Washington, July 7th, National News Agency - Congressman Serovich, a New York physician, gave a speech in the House of Representatives today, criticizing Britain for holding the world's opium monopoly and providing interest-free loans to opium poppy growers to encourage opium production. Britain has informal personnel scattered all over the world to supply opium to addicts. Poppies are mostly produced in Asian territories belonging to India, Egypt, Persia, and Turkey. Most of the world's poppy production is made into opium in the British Isles. Serovich proposed a bill to authorize President Hoover to convene a conference in Washington next year to negotiate an opium agreement with various civilized countries. During his speech, Serovich also said that America's prohibition has driven many weak-willed people to drug addiction. Serovich advocated allocating US$36 million annually to cover the expenses of strictly enforcing anti-narcotics laws. He also said that one ounce of opium sells for fifty cents in Europe, but can sell for one hundred and fifty dollars when transported to the United States. According to statistics, the amount of opium needed per person in various countries is one grain in Britain, twice that of Britain in Germany, twice that of Germany in France, and twice that of France in the United States. Mr. Pult had previously proposed a bill to establish another agency to strictly enforce anti-narcotics laws, and Serovich expressed deep sympathy. However, Pult believed that the United States is not the country with the highest opium consumption, and the remarks made by specialized reformers seemed to be exaggerated.</p>
<h3>US Wheat Relief to China Bill Expected to Pass</h3>
<p>Washington, July 7th, National News Agency - The proposal made by Mr. McMaster to purchase US$25 million of American wheat and transport it to China for disaster relief has attracted much attention from farmers and politicians.

The proposer Mr. McMaster told people today that this proposal has a good chance of passing.</p>
<h3>Discussions on the British Imperial United Party's Cause</h3>
<p>The Opinion of Viscount Rothermere</p>
<p>London, July 7th, Reuters - Viscount Rothermere, who co-founded the Imperial United Party with Sir Beaverbrook, published an article today, disclosing the cause of the Imperial United Party in the newspaper, saying that 173,000 people have joined the party. One of the party's goals has now been achieved, that is, the Conservative Party has officially adopted its proposed policy of imperial free trade. However, the party's work will not end due to the achievement of one goal, and it will continue to do its best to achieve its other four goals, at least three of which are more important than imperial free trade. The so-called other goals are: (1) Immediately levy high import tariffs on various manufactured goods and provide full subsidies to agriculture; (2) Actively reduce government spending; (3) No longer make concessions to India; (4) Sever diplomatic relations with the Russian government. He hopes that the Conservative Party will adopt all the policies of the Imperial United Party to avoid the need for confrontation. After seeing this article, Sir Beaverbrook, another co-founder, stated that Viscount Rothermere's opinion is completely different from the original purpose of the Imperial United Party. Lord Rothermere is now free to develop his personal political views. Although he has a good personal relationship with Rothermere, he cannot agree with him. The treasurer of the Imperial United Party's basic fund has now announced that it has been decided to return all donations to the original donors.</p>
<h3>British Air Ministry Budget Expenses</h3>
<p>London, July 4th, Reuters - The Air Ministry's budget for 1930 is £17,850,000. The final account for 1929, including additional expenses, was £16,960,000, so the increase in 1930 compared to 1929 is £890,000. According to Air</p>
<p>Minister Thomson's attachment to the aviation budget, it is stated that, according to the procedure for 1930, the increase in the air force is very noticeable, and its aim is to express the British government's enthusiasm for avoiding the cruel competition of air force armaments.</p>
<p>Accusation Case of Japanese Minister of Education Kobashi</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 8th, Electric Communications Agency - The procedures for the prosecution of former Minister of Education Kobashi have already been submitted for approval. Minister of Justice Fubien said that the prosecution policy of the prosecuting authorities will not be given administrative instructions. The facts of the prosecutor's investigation are clarified by legitimate methods only. And the government on this, only said that the accusation of Minister of Education Kobashi is very regrettable. As for the claim that Prime Minister Hamaguchi appointed the wrong person, Minister of Education Kobashi has already resigned, and the content of the accusation is also a matter before the establishment of the current cabinet. This is not known to the current cabinet, so Prime Minister Hamaguchi is not directly responsible.</p>
<p>This is intended to silence the mouths of those who want to blame him. However, the suspected person is among the cabinet members. The pure responsibility theory regarding this point cannot be avoided. Therefore, in addition to the opposition party Seiyukai in the Lower House, a part of the Upper House will also decide on the responsibility of the government and the Prime Minister in this matter. Therefore, this issue will definitely be the source of disputes between the upper and lower houses. The government must be prepared to deal with it. Seiyukai Secretary-General Mori is quite pleased with this matter, saying, "Where is Prime Minister Hamaguchi's grand speech now?" The Seiyukai is determined to ask the government and the Prime Minister for responsibility from the people.</p>

<p>Financial Report for the 17th Year</p>
<p>The First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee reviewed this financial income and expenditure report, which was prepared based on the fiscal year, from July of the 17th year to June of the 18th year. The income and expenditure figures for the most recent six months have not yet been compiled, so a brief account of what is available is given first, for your consideration. Since the summer of the 17th year, after the Northern Expeditionary Army recovered Beiping, the whole country was unified in form, and administrative power was unified in fact. However, from the perspective of national finance, the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Qin, Long, Shanxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and the three eastern provinces, except for customs revenue, were not actually within the scope of the Ministry of Finance. As for Hunan and Guangdong, they only began to be completely recovered after the suppression of the Gui faction in the spring and summer of the 18th year. The provinces of Shandong and Henan were also subordinate to the central government only after the Japanese troops and Feng Yuxiang's army withdrew in the summer of the 18th year. These are just the most prominent provinces; there are also several other provinces that were directly under the jurisdiction of the central government only at the end of the accounting year, and the collection and compilation of data was difficult. Therefore, it is factually difficult to fully collect statistics for this report. Now, based on a mixed reporting method, the main points are summarized as follows: (1) the total income and expenditure of the central government for one year, and (2) the total income and expenditure of various provinces and regions after they were successively brought under the central government's control. As for those areas that are not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and cannot be listed, they are generally omitted. (The overview of the income and expenditure statement of the National Government for the 17th year has already been seen in the important telegrams, so it is omitted.)</p>
<p>Internal disasters and chaos occurred one after another, bandits rose in droves, and the economic organization was not yet sound. The government, in order to make up for the shortage of party, government, and military expenses, had no choice but to issue public bonds and treasury bills, borrowing 80 million yuan from the people (excluding the 30 million yuan of the Central Bank's fund). However, this unavoidable method has one main reason: (1) At the beginning of the year and for most of the accounting year, although the government bore the responsibility for the whole country, only the finances of five provinces were under the control of the central government, and (2) during this accounting year, the government launched three large-scale expeditions for the sake of peaceful unification. However, compared with the previous year, the situation in the 17th year has greatly improved. In the previous year's expenditure, about three-quarters of the amount was borrowed from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for several months. However, if the income and expenditure were announced at that time, it would inevitably cause panic among the people and be detrimental to the progress of the Northern Expedition. Therefore, it was delayed until the compilation meeting in January of the 18th year that the total income and expenditure was announced. Tax revenue for the accounting year of the 17th year has indeed improved because the central government's political power has been expanding day by day during this year, and the tax system has also been improving day by day. When calculating income and expenditure in the 18th year, it was roughly able to offset each other, and it was almost possible not to rely on debt. The bad habit of living on debt for the past ten years has now been hoped to be resolved. Unfortunately, it has deteriorated again in recent months, with internal strife breaking out everywhere. The ambitious warlords have once again sent their henchmen to intercept the treasury, and expenses are increasing day by day, while tax revenues are decreasing day by day without end. However, the principles that have been clarified during the 17th year should not be abandoned. It is hoped that the people of the country will tend towards peace and maintain order, so that domestic tax revenues can increase sharply, and the income and expenditure budget will not be difficult to offset. As a result, national wealth will increase, construction projects can be carried out, and domestic and foreign credit can also be restored smoothly. If the government's financial plan is fundamentally sound, the effect will be immediately visible once peace is realized. I will now present the categories under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance as follows: Customs affairs: After the government and various countries (except Japan) signed treaties on tariff autonomy, they implemented the new tariff rules from February 1st of the 18th year. These rules were only implemented for five months in this year. The original 5% ad valorem tax and the 2.5% surtax were replaced by the new tariff rules. According to the above-mentioned 2.5% surtax, a portion was directly collected by the central government, and the remaining portion was originally collected by various provinces and regions. The righteousness of this top surtax and its collection agency has been done and must be implemented, but it was only realized after going through great difficulties in procedure. The result of the implementation of the new tariff rules is generally satisfactory. Unfortunately, due to gold prices, a considerable portion of the increased revenue was spent on the exchange of foreign debts and indemnities. Recently, the price of silver has fallen, resulting in a daily increase in the trend of imports, which has led to a sharp reduction in customs revenue in recent months. The government, on the one hand, pretends to protect customs revenues and not to be too low, and on the other hand, to remedy the debt gold exchange rate and not to suffer too much loss, decided to change the public import tax to a gold unit system, which has already been implemented from February of the 19th year. When the 5% tax was implemented, the motivation for tax evasion was relatively small. Since the implementation of the new tax rules, tax evasion has become a major problem. Nearby Hong Kong is the main camp, only a river away, and there is no control over ships coming and going. Our country is constrained by unequal treaties, and the territorial waters between Hong Kong and the mainland are also invaded by the Hong Kong government. Therefore, general merchants are unscrupulous and use Hong Kong for tax evasion. The Hong Kong government, although not intentionally condoning it, has not taken measures to stop it. Under these circumstances, it seems that unless the government and the Hong Kong government properly remedy the situation and pay attention to suppressing smuggling, Hong Kong will forever be reduced to the refuge of tax evaders, and the country's tax revenue will suffer losses that are not insignificant. In the summer of the 17th year, the customs system, in name, was managed by the Beijing Customs Office, but in reality, the office was no different from a branch. The Chief Inspector of Customs, Silas, ran between the government and the East 交民巷 (Embassy Row), probing and receiving instructions, humiliating the country and forfeiting its rights. It was not until July of the 17th year that the government abolished the Customs Office and transferred customs affairs to the Customs Administration, which was directly under the Ministry of Finance. Since then, although the administration and service of the customs have remained the same, in terms of responsibilities, in addition to inheriting government orders and specializing in the collection of customs duties, they must absolutely not interfere in matters involving politics and other areas. Therefore, the status and reputation of the customs have gradually increased, and its effectiveness has also increased greatly. There is also an unequal situation that is now being improved. For fifty years, Chinese employees serving in the customs have never been promoted to the position of Customs Officer. Now, a method of treating Chinese and foreign employees equally has been revised, and promotions are determined based on their qualifications and seniority. In the future, the hiring of foreign customs officers will be limited to technical and health aspects and must be specially approved by the Minister of Finance. At the same time, the customs has also adopted a strict examination system, recruiting high-level talents of Chinese nationality, and selecting customs officials who have graduated from domestic universities and have considerable experience to be sent to the UK and the US for on-site inspections. This talent is to lay the foundation for future customs reforms. Since the implementation of the government's new policy, the current Chief Inspector of Customs has been able to abide by it. It has been found that there is already one Chinese employee who is a Customs Officer, seven who are acting Customs Officers, one who is a Deputy Customs Officer, and eight who are acting Deputy Customs Officers. Chinese and foreign employees are all able to work together harmoniously. Just look at the fact that from February of the 18th year, the simple 5% tax was suddenly changed to a complex tiered tax, and the degree of difficulty has not been heard of any objections, which is enough to show the soundness of customs administration. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Internal and Educational Departments Plan</p>
<p>Alternative Measures for Traditional Lunar Festivals</p>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Education, considering that all traditional lunar festivals are now abolished, plan to formulate equivalent alternative festivals for the people to rest and enjoy themselves. They have specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which will then be submitted to the National Government for approval and implementation. The submission is as follows: The abolition of the lunar calendar has been strictly implemented this year, and all traditional lunar festivals have also been eliminated as a result. However, considering that changing customs and habits should be done gradually and with better methods, and that it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons of what to eliminate and what to retain, or what to promote and what to curtail, and to make appropriate changes in order to ensure smooth implementation, the officials of this ministry believe that at this time of removing the old and establishing the new, it seems appropriate to formulate equivalent alternative festivals for the people to rest and enjoy themselves. Now, we respectfully present the reasons and methods as follows: It has been a long-standing custom for the people to celebrate the Lantern Festival, the Shangsi Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival, the Qixi Festival, the Zhongyuan Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Double Ninth Festival, and the Laba Festival. These festivals have always been used as periods of rest or entertainment. The Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival are especially valued by the general public. This is because, in our country's social habits, except for public institutions and organizations, the weekly rest system has not yet been fully adopted. If the general public works hard throughout the year without setting certain dates for rest and entertainment during a reasonable period, in order to adjust themselves, life will become too mechanical, and work efficiency will also be unsatisfactory. The National Government's clear order to announce holidays last year seems to be appropriate for rest and entertainment dates. However, except for the two commemorations of the death of the Premier and the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs, when the whole country should mourn, there are only four commemorative days that can be used: the founding of the Republic of China, National Day, the oath-taking of the National Revolutionary Army, and the birth of the Generalissimo. Moreover, the above-mentioned days are all revolutionary commemorations, and all parties must pay attention to publicity. Therefore, only the New Year holidays can be used, but the period is only two days, and the opportunity for rest and entertainment is limited. It is questionable whether it can adjust the hard work of the whole year. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to abolish the Lantern Festival and the Shangsi Festival abruptly in the future. However, the calculation of these festivals has always been based on the lunar calendar. If we still follow the old customs, it would contradict the laws and regulations prohibiting the use of the lunar calendar. It would be more appropriate to formulate equivalent alternative festivals and promote them throughout the country. Many parties are now making this request. The officials of this ministry have recently considered the facts and consulted with the people. We respectfully propose the following methods: (1) Except for the Mid-Autumn Festival, all lunar festivals should be converted to the national calendar month and day calculation, that is, January 1st of the national calendar should be the New Year's Day, the 15th should be the Lantern Festival, March 3rd should be the Shangsi Festival, May 5th should be the Dragon Boat Festival, July 7th should be the Qixi Festival, the 15th should be the Zhongyuan Festival, September 9th should be the Double Ninth Festival, and December 8th should be the Laba Festival. As for the Mid-Autumn Festival, it should be changed to the nearest full moon on the autumn equinox (the earliest is September 9th and the latest is October 7th). All customs of lighting lanterns, spring cleaning, dragon boat racing, begging for skills, worshipping ancestors, enjoying the moon, and climbing heights, which were used by the people when using the lunar calendar, should be allowed to be held on time. In this transition, the idea of appropriately changing old customs is still implied in the promotion of the national calendar. Abolishing and establishing, promoting and curtailing are considered together. It seems to be in line with the principle of gradual decline and gradual victory. Moreover, after the festivals are changed, if the party departments at all levels, together with the local governments and local organizations, do their best to promote and hold various timely entertainment activities, they can shift the public's attention from this point on and no longer be attached to the lunar calendar. It is not impossible to help promote the national calendar. (2) It seems inappropriate for government agencies at all levels and schools at all levels to use these festivals as holidays. The holiday standards should still be based on the holiday schedule for various agencies and schools promulgated by the National Government. It seems that there is no conflict. (3) The newly formulated alternative festivals are planned to be printed on the national calendar for the 20th year, and they should be indicated separately under the month and day of the national calendar, so as to have a new view and avoid disputes. Some say that since the lunar calendar has been abolished, all related old habits should be abolished to avoid leaving traces. Others say that moving the lunar festivals to the national calendar is inevitable forced and that it does not match the original date, and it also loses the meaning of various commemorations. Regarding the former, the officials of this ministry believe that as long as it does not go against the party's doctrines and does not harm customs, public order, and social security, there is no need to eliminate it broadly. For example, the celebration of the New Year and the commemoration of Confucius have been clearly stipulated by the National Government. This is a clear example. Regarding the latter, the officials of this ministry have investigated that the National Government has changed the commemoration of the seventy-two martyrs and the birth of Confucius to the same month and day in the national calendar. Since its implementation, no one has doubted it as forced. Using this as an example, there seems to be no need to worry. In addition, as everyone knows, the Dragon Boat Festival commemorates Qu Yuan, and the Cold Food Festival commemorates Jie Zitui. However, it is only rumored that Qu Yuan drowned himself on the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Cold Food Festival varies with each year's Qingming Festival. There is no fixed date when using the lunar calendar, but it does not lose the meaning of its commemoration. Moreover, the calendar and the first month of our country have been changed repeatedly in successive dynasties. From Jianzi and Jianhai to Jianyin, the date of the Dragon Boat Festival has also changed accordingly, so the latter does not become an issue. Furthermore, since Japan changed to the solar calendar, it has also moved the old festivals to the solar calendar. The implementation has been very convenient for a long time and can especially provide a reference for our country. The case has been discussed back and forth by the officials of this ministry, and the opinions are the same. It is reasonable to submit it to your esteemed council for consideration and then submit it to the National Government for approval and implementation. It is truly fair and convenient.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>Standard for Applying the Committee System</p>
<p>The committee system was originally one of the ways of organizing politics. When applied properly, it has the benefit of gathering ideas from various sources and combining the strengths of all. When applied improperly, it has the disadvantages of unclear responsibilities, wasting time, and missing opportunities. In recent years, the tendency to abuse the committee system in party and government agencies at all levels has been very obvious, and its malpractices are enough to reduce administrative efficiency and waste national funds. In order to remedy this undesirable trend, the standard for applying the committee system is hereby determined as follows: (1) The committee system is only applicable to the following three types of institutions: A. Deliberative institutions, B. Design institutions, and C. Consultative institutions. (2) The affiliation of the committee system is divided into the following three types: A. Those set above the chief executive of the executive agency, B. Those set beside the chief executive of the executive agency, and C. Those set below the chief executive of the executive agency. (3) In all committees belonging to administrative agencies, the chairman of the committee shall not set up standing committees. (4) Administrative agencies shall, in principle, not adopt the committee system. (5) When design or consultative institutions adopt the committee system, they shall not set up a complex committee system within the same institution, that is, no committees shall be set up under the committee, but deliberative institutions are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>Proposal for the Government to Establish Large Factories in Various Provinces to Accommodate Unemployed People</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal, there are many unemployed people in various provinces now.</p>
<p>From a negative point of view, it is enough to create social instability. From a positive point of view, it also violates the late Premier's intention to promote the Principle of the People's Livelihood. The countries of the world all have state-owned large-scale factories, concentrating national capital and accommodating a large number of workers, in order to regulate people's livelihood and promote industry, which is very effective. Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and goods are stored in the ground, but due to economic relations, they cannot be developed, causing many people to be unemployed and creating a precarious situation for people's livelihood. Looking ahead, we are very worried. For this reason, it is proposed that the government establish large-scale factories in various provinces and regions, and the management methods should be based on private business operations, and people should be temporarily allowed to invest shares to facilitate the process. However, this is a major undertaking and cannot be achieved overnight. It is planned to select appropriate locations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces first, start operating, and gradually extend it to various provinces. In this way, the non-productive elements in society will not only be reduced day by day but can also be turned into productive elements, which will benefit both the national economy and people's livelihood. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await your decision. Proposers: Jiao Yitang, Chen Qiying.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Will Establish Reformatory</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Rectification Committee previously believed that among the reactionary elements captured by the courts and administrative agencies of various counties in the province, there were quite a few who were suspected but had no concrete material evidence. If they were to be convicted of reaction, there would be many difficulties in fact. If they were to be released altogether, it was feared that these people would easily have the mentality of playing with the law. The only plan is to establish a reformatory and impose moral influence, so as to avoid injustice and eliminate reaction. After submitting this idea to the central government for approval, the reply from the Central Secretariat has now been received, which briefly stated that after the Central Standing Committee approved the National Government to handle the matter, the National Government then replied that the case had been approved by the Chairman to be handled by the Executive Yuan. It is thought that the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Reformatory will not be far off.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Continuation of the Assassination of Liu Lianyi of the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The situation surrounding the assassination of Liu Lianyi, a member of the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee and Director of the Organization Department, was briefly described in yesterday's letter. Now, I will further elaborate on the details as follows: Liu is twenty-seven years old and hails from Louxia County in this province. Recently, he has also been serving as the Director of the General Affairs Section of the Party Affairs Workers Training Class. Therefore, he goes to work every afternoon and is exceptionally busy. The Training Class is located behind the Preparatory Committee of Qingda University, and the student dormitory building is also there (formerly part of the dyeing field of the Industrial School). For convenience, they use the newly opened gate at Ma Paoquan instead of going around the old gate on Zhengjuesi Street. Mr. Liu always comes by car, parking it outside the gate. On the afternoon of the fourth, at five o'clock, Mr. Liu finished his work and wanted to leave. Although he had three attendants with him, they were all waiting in the car. Mr. Liu came out of the office alone. Just as he exited the round gate, while many students were playing ball in the field, two people, seemingly lying in wait for Mr. Liu, took advantage of the crowd's inattention. Before Mr. Liu had taken a few steps out of the round gate, the assailant fired a pistol at Liu from behind with two loud bangs. One bullet passed through Liu's clothes and trousers, and the other entered from the lower back, exiting through the lower abdomen. At this time, the field was thrown into chaos by the gunfire. In the confusion, the assailant was seen fleeing backward (not towards the main gate, but seemingly towards the dormitory building). Mr. Liu initially turned around in surprise upon hearing the gunshots, unaware of being injured. Attendants and police outside the gate, and police from Qingda University, rushed in to check. Mr. Liu asked others where the gunfire came from. Someone said whether it was Comrade Liu's pistol misfiring (Liu always carried a pistol). Mr. Liu checked himself, and the pistol was as it was. It was not until people saw small holes in his clothes, front and back, and pointed them out to him, that Mr. Liu began to feel a slight pain. After a while, he reported to the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the Public Security Bureau by telephone. Zhang Jinjian, of the Provincial Reorganization Committee, rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. He first directed the police to cut off traffic and inspect all parts of the school. Mr. Liu then got into the car and went to Jinan Hospital. The school's internal investigation revealed that a pistol was found on student Qu Yuqing (from Yanggu County, Jinning Reorganization Committee), and two suspects who came to visit were also detained. All three were taken to headquarters for investigation. However, Qu was usually peaceful in his actions, and the pistol found did not match the shell casings, so the evidence was deemed insufficient. The other two are still under investigation. The school was only released from alert at noon on the fifth, but classes have not yet resumed. After Mr. Liu arrived at Jinan Hospital at six o'clock, Chen Tiaoyuan sent Huang Yaodong, the Director of the Army Hospital, and Zhao Jingshi, the Mayor of Jinan, also arrived. By this time, the hospital had already closed, and President Xu Changdao and the Chief of Surgery, An Jincheng (Japanese), were temporarily gathered to examine him. According to them, surgery was necessary. He Siyuan, the Director of Education, and Zhu Xi, the Director of Finance, immediately rushed to the scene. After discussion, it was decided to ask the hospital to perform surgery. Until ten o'clock in the evening, Mr. Liu was still talking as usual. The surgery began at ten o'clock, and it took a lot of effort because the small intestine was severed. It was completed at twelve o'clock and he was sent to the Special Ward Xuan character room. Liu was still not in much pain, and was still conscious at two o'clock at night. Four o'clock was the most painful period. As of today (the fifth), his condition is gradually improving. According to the doctor, the night of the fourth was the most dangerous, with only one-tenth of hope. Today, there is already five-tenths of hope. If there are no other changes, he can be expected to recover soon. After this case occurred, the Provincial Party Department has reported to the Central Government by telegram and offered a reward of 10,000 yuan for the capture of the perpetrator. (March 5th) The Funds for the Yongding River Project are Still Not Settled</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The breach of the Yongding River could not be blocked and repaired due to funding problems. Recently, the Central Construction Committee sent a telegram to the Hebei Provincial Government, stating that the construction funds could be temporarily borrowed from the increased price of Changlu salt, and that the Ministry of Finance had ordered the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy to comply. However, the Construction Department inquired with the Changlu Salt Transport Office, and they stated that they had not received an order from the Ministry and could not comply. Now that the Jingzhe season is approaching, the period before the major flood is near, and blocking and repairing the breach cannot be delayed any longer. The Construction Department is therefore extremely anxious. Yesterday, they jointly drafted a telegram with the Finance Department, requesting the Provincial Committee to send it to the Central Government to urge the construction funds again. The telegram stated that they received the telegram from the Construction Committee stating that the Ministry of Finance had ordered the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy to comply with the case of temporarily borrowing construction funds from the increased price of Changlu salt to block and repair the breach of the Yongding River, and instructed to consult with the Salt Transport Envoy to discuss the method of appropriation, etc. They had already ordered the Finance and Construction Departments to consult with the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy, who stated that they had not received an order from the Ministry and could not comply. Now that the Jingzhe season is approaching, and the major flood is imminent, the Yongding River blocking project is extremely urgent, and the need for funds is more urgent than fire. If huge sums can be allocated quickly in the near future, the project may be completed in time. Otherwise, if the opportunity is missed, it will inevitably be impossible to save. It is requested that the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy be telegraphed quickly to allocate the 1 million yuan of additional tax on Changlu salt approved by the Central Government as soon as possible for application, so as not to delay important projects, and hope to reply by telegram, etc. It is heard that it will be submitted to the Provincial Government meeting for approval today (the 4th) and sent immediately. The people along the river are now facing the imminent flood, and the time is tight. If it is not repaired in time, and the spring water rises soon, not only the collapse of the Yongding River is worrying, but other rivers such as the Daqing River will inevitably be affected, overflowing and collapsing. The survivors of last year's disaster will be wiped out. Therefore, more than 100 representatives were sent from Xiong County, Xinzhen, Xincheng, Ba County, Yuncheng, Wen'an, Dacheng, Jinghai, Yongqing County, and Zhuo County to Beiping to petition. The representatives went to the Construction Department to petition yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Department Chief Wen Shouquan and Director of the Yongding River Affairs Bureau Feng Heming received them separately and promised that no matter what, they would submit it to the Provincial Government Committee meeting today and try their best to find a solution. The representatives were satisfied and left. (4th) Establishment of the Gengxu Uprising Commemorative Association</p>
<p>Aims to Commend the Martyrs</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: On the third day of the first month of the Gengxu year, the Guangdong New Army, resenting the dictatorship of the Manchu chieftains, and under the guidance of Sun Yat-sen, swore an oath at the foot of Baiyun Mountain and launched an uprising at Niuwangmiao. At that time, the troops who went out to fight included three battalions of infantry, two battalions of artillery, one battalion of engineers, and one battalion of logistics, a total of seven battalions of about a thousand people. Unfortunately, the reinforcements were insufficient, and the ammunition was exhausted, and the success failed. At that time, more than 300 people died in battle, were captured and killed, or avoided being pitied in various villages and starved to death. The corpses were displayed in the wilderness without coffins. After the establishment of the Republic of China, in memory of the previous merits, a Loyal Martyrs Shrine was built in Niuwangmiao to leave a memorial. In recent years, due to changes in the political situation, those in charge did not have time to pay attention to this, which caused the lonely shrine of the martyrs to be dilapidated, the tombs to be covered with weeds, and the wheat rice to be unavailable for worship. The descendants were out of school. Now, those who participated in this campaign specially gathered comrades to organize a memorial association in Taikangli, Guangzhou, to handle the main tasks of repairing the shrine, building the tomb, compiling history, and holding public sacrifices. The association has been established, and the Guangdong Provincial Government and all walks of life have assisted with 10,000 yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Government and Zhang Jingjiang, Li Jishen, etc. have also donated to help. The association will immediately proceed actively, and also send Zeng Gongyu as a representative to Beijing to petition the Central National Government and various ministries and courts for the allocation of funds to support the righteous cause and to commend the martyrs. Enclosed is the declaration of the Guangdong New Army Gengxu Uprising Comrades Commemorative Association as follows: "The Republic is completed, and the autocracy is overthrown. Many say that the success is due to the Wuchang Uprising in Xinhai. However, tracing back to the previous merits of the revolution, they are all due to the leadership and advocacy of the late Premier, who was unyielding, and made the national foundation of the Republic of China finally successful. However, in the last years of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, at the turn of Gengxu and Xinhai, the success of the national revolution was like a thousand pounds hanging by a thread, which was fleeting and dispersed if it was relaxed. If there had not been the Battle of March 29, then the Wuchang Uprising would not have been so quick and effective in responding. If there had not been the Guangdong New Army Uprising in Gengxu, then the Battle of March 29 would not have been so strong and great in prestige. The Wuchang Uprising was difficult to make, with the army as the foundation, and the Gengxu Uprising was also based on the army as the main force. The reason why it inspired the national army, the ideology was mutual, and the voice was connected, enough to promote the great cause of the Wuchang Uprising and the pregnancy of the Republic of China. The importance of its relationship, the greatness of its merits, and the immeasurable limits, are extremely impressive and magnificent. Alas, on the third day of the first month of the Gengxu year, the comrades of our Guangdong New Army first rose up in Guangzhou. In this battle, more than 300 martyrs, including Ni Yingdian, Li Shijie, Huang Hongkun, Qiu Suyi, Shi Liguangtai, Li Baohe, Xiang Zuobang, Zhao Guogui, Peng Zhaoqing, and Chen Wenkun, were martyred. It was only because the reinforcements were insufficient and the ammunition was exhausted that they suffered defeat. The comrades scattered in the villages, their clothes were tattered, and they could not eat for several days and nights. They would rather starve to death than damage a single grass or tree of the people, and would not accept a single grain of millet from the villagers. The villagers were moved to tears and could arouse many people to express sympathy for the revolutionaries. There is still much to say about the dispatch of this battle. This kind of persevering spirit can be a model for revolutionary soldiers. The noble character and high moral character were spread and sung in those years. In the history of the revolution, who does not know the importance of the meaning and value of this battle? However, since the establishment of the Republic of China, the people of the country have not expressed anything about this, and they have not commended the martyrs. At that time, the events have also been buried. The lonely shrine of the martyrs is dilapidated, the tombs are covered with weeds, and the wheat rice is not supplied for worship. The revolutionary deeds of the past were grand and equal to extinction. The worship and reward are not heard, and the post-disaster is not provided. How can we comfort the dead and how can we encourage the future? It has only been more than ten years, and it has been completely forgotten. If we go beyond hundreds of years, will we not be destroyed? The comrades in the year of the battle are ashamed of being dead, and they see this seclusion, but they do not think about it, and they are really vigilant. Therefore, we unite with all comrades to organize the Guangdong New Army Gengxu Uprising Comrades Commemorative Association, to handle the building of shrines and repairing tombs to properly accommodate the heroic spirits, compile credible history to illuminate the documents, organize public sacrifices to enhance the feelings, and set up schools to teach the orphans. Now we plan to persuade comrades from the military, political, commercial, and academic circles to donate money, and do our best to start the industry. It has been carried out in order, and it will be completed in time. Only our comrades who have survived the war should not forget the great significance of the martyrs' sacrifices for the revolution when the memorial association was founded. And the people of the country should not forget the Guangdong New Army in Gengxu when commemorating the Battle of March 29 and the Wuchang Uprising. It is the pioneer of the national army's revolution. It is clear that the success of the republic was directly achieved in Xinhai, and indirectly in Gengxu. Then we know that its merits are worthy of record and must be recorded. As for the future revolutionary achievements of our comrades, all that continues the legacy of the Premier and inherits the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs, and we will not be discouraged and will not give up, and will go all out. Then the former emblem will not fall, and the reputation will be guaranteed. The establishment of this association will not be there. This is a declaration." The Process of Establishing a Special Commissioner's Office in Jilin by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Zhong Yu has been appointed</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The negotiation officers of the provinces of Ha, Chang, and Yan in this province were ordered to be abolished at the end of August last year. All foreign affairs are temporarily handled by the municipal preparatory offices of each place. The special commissioners of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in various provinces were abolished at the end of December last year, and the order of the Ministry has been implemented. However, the situation in remote provinces is different, and the Northeast is in a special position. The chief officials Yuan Ning and Zhang telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to delay the abolition of the special commissioners of the three provinces. After repeated back and forth, it was decided to set up a special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Liaoyang and Harbin to handle foreign affairs nearby. At that time, the Jilin provincial authorities agreed that the diplomacy of Harbin was important, and that it was appropriate to set up a special commissioner. However, Jilin was the diplomatic hub of the province, and the negotiations with Japan in Changchun were frequent, and the situation in the Yanbian area was even more special. The diplomacy of the two places of Yanbian and Changchun has always been instructed by the provincial government, and special commissioners should be sent to Jilin to hold everything. A telegram was sent to the Northeast Political Committee to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was not approved. A few months ago, Mo Dehui went to Beijing. Governor Zhang entrusted Mo to discuss the solution with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs planned to move the special commissioner of Harbin to Jilin. However, the Jilin provincial authorities stated that the purpose of the discussion was not that Harbin did not need to set up a commissioner, but that Jilin should also be set up in addition to Harbin, so as not to be out of reach. Therefore, a telegram was sent by Mo again to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Subsequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to consider both comprehensively, planned to set up a special commissioner in Liaoyang and Harbin, and the name of the agency would be the office of the special commissioner in a certain place. The special commissioner of Liaoyang would appoint a director to station in Jiang, and the special commissioner of Harbin would appoint a director to station in Jilin to coordinate. However, the Jilin provincial authorities still did not agree with this method and insisted on the original proposal. Now it is heard that it has been understood by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and agreed to set up a special commissioner in Jilin. Zhong Yu has been appointed on the seventeenth, and ordered to go to Beijing to contact everything. Zhong has asked the provincial government for instructions and is preparing to go to Beijing.

<p>Northeast Shipping Merchants Strive for Navigation Rights</p>
<p>Petition the Transportation Committee to Forward to Mo Dehui</p>
<p>Refute the Russian Proposal on Navigation Rights</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Northeast shipping merchants, the former director of the shipping department of the East Railway Bureau suggested three items to the Russian government: recovering the old ships of the East Railway, operating on their own, exchanging the navigation lines of the Songhua, Heilongjiang, and Wusuli rivers, and Russian merchant ships freely sailing the Songhua River. The Russian government has already prepared to submit it to the official Sino-Russian conference. The shipping merchants heard about this and believed that it was of great concern to the interests of Chinese shipping, so in addition to Shen Honglie's previous personal presentation in Harbin, begging him to explain the pros and cons to the relevant parties and pay attention to it, the full assembly of shipping merchants recently decided to telegraph the Northeast Transportation Committee, put forward several points, and asked to forward them to Mo Dehui, who attended the Sino-Russian conference, so as not to be unable to cope with the meeting. The main points of the presentation are as follows: (1) Requesting the Soviet Union to allow Russian merchant ships to sail on the Songhua River. The Songhua River is the lifeline of our Northeast shipping industry. In the 24th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, Russia was only allowed to build roads in the three provinces of the East. Later, the project was urgently needed, and the Songhua River was temporarily used to transport materials, and the expediency was to become the root of self-destruction. Moreover, the East Railway negotiation has not reached a formal level, and it is difficult to talk about extra-railway issues. This should be resisted with efforts. (2) Requesting the return of nine confiscated merchant ships. When the Soviet Union was in the midst of revolution and riots in Moscow in 1919, it adopted the principle of not being able to care about the East, so it signed the Sino-Russian Feng-Russian Agreement with us and sold the merchant ships to us uniformly. The original ship names were (1) Ivan A. Berlin, now Haicheng, (1) Lebak, now Yixing, (1) Siberiak, now Aihui, (1) Aikonomu Nai, now Shenyang, (1) Linok, now Huagai. The total price was 3,022,051.50 rubles. All of them were contracted in 1919 through the Soviet Consul Bulaikov, and the price was paid in full. As for the Hongtai ship, Wang Youhai purchased it from Russian merchants in Heihe. Some of the Yu Tongfeng Weitong Haichang and other ships were manufactured in Harbin by merchants in recent years, and they are now detained. If the Soviet Union refers to them as confiscated items, it is even more deliberate. This should be resisted with a consistent effort. (3) Requesting to exchange the navigation lines of the Songhua, Heilongjiang, and Wusuli rivers and to formulate new chapters. The navigation rights of the three rivers are now only completely owned by the Songhua River. As mentioned above, in the eighth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, the navigation of the Heilongjiang and Wusuli rivers was limited to China and Russia. In the tenth year of Xianfeng, the area east of the Wusuli River was ceded to Russia. Moreover, these treaties were all forcibly signed, and they are already unequal. Our people are seeking to move unanimously to overthrow them, and they are afraid of being in a hurry. If we allow the charter to exchange navigation rights, it will not only lead the wolf into the house, but also make our Northeast shipping industry unbearable. Such a policy of gradualism should be resisted desperately. In summary, the facts are all there, and it is difficult to let them speak indiscriminately, or refer to the near evidence to refute, or refuse sternly based on reason, in order to emphasize national rights. (February 28th) Liaoning Province is Preparing for the Municipal Administration of Various Counties</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning Civil Affairs Department, in view of the importance of municipal administration, recently issued a circular to various counties, earnestly preparing for municipal administration, in order to revitalize the ground. The circular is as follows: (It is found that the municipal administration is related to the development of local undertakings, which is very important. Since the establishment of this department, it has repeatedly ordered various counties to earnestly handle them according to their financial resources, distinguishing between urgency and slowness, in order to revitalize the ground. It is also found that the matters to be handled by the municipal government do not require a special agency. The decision was made through the Provincial Committee to cancel all the municipal agencies established in various counties and let the county government be responsible for handling them. Subsequently, Gaiping, Liaoyang, Dongfeng, Xi'an, Fushun, Taonan and other counties successively stated that the ground was prosperous and there were many municipal affairs, and they requested to add a third section to be in charge. They were also approved in the record. However, those who have added sections have special responsibilities. The progress of municipal administration should have a detailed plan. Although the situation of handling affairs in those who have not added sections cannot be compared with those who have added sections, it is a matter of important policy and should also formulate the direction of progress within the scope of their capabilities. However, the counties that have added sections, except for Gaiping County, have already proposed a phased plan for municipal administration, which is still detailed. The counties of Dongfeng, Xi'an, Liaoyang, Xifeng, Taonan, and Fushun have either reported without details, or only reported the management of streets, the suppression of construction, etc., or did not report at all. The counties that have not added sections have mostly rejected and procrastinated, perfunctoryly reporting, treating it as a done deal. In this situation, it is not only a waste of public funds, but also a neglect of government orders. How can we plan the progress of municipal administration and expect the development of the ground? For this reason, all counties that have added sections should formulate a detailed plan for the municipal administration to be handled this year. Those who have not added sections should also check the situation of the county and propose the matters to be carried out for verification, in order to emphasize the municipal administration. (March 1st)</p>

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Refugees Pass Through and Cause Disturbances More than 300 refugees from Hunan Province arrived in Qishuqihui Township on the previous day. They scattered to the villages and forcibly demanded money and goods. The head of the township, witnessing this situation, was afraid of causing trouble.

<p>Anxious to Get Married, but Turns into a Stalemate Xu, a resident of a certain town in Qingpu, is already in his sixties. His wife has been dead for many years, and he has a son and a daughter. His son, Di Chang, is already a young man. In the year, he was engaged to the daughter of Shen, who lives in the same town, by the neighbor as a matchmaker. Since the engagement, Di Chang has been in contact with his fiancée, and their love has reached the boiling point. However, his father believes that there is a lack of economy, and he will be able to marry only after two years. Di Chang could not bear it. In the winter of last year, he went to his father-in-law's house alone and asked to get married hastily within the New Year. Shen was furious when he heard the words and wanted to break the previous agreement, and did not allow him to meet his daughter. Di Chang knew he was disappointed, so he secretly agreed with his fiancée to take a boat to Shanghai. However, he did not expect the opportunity to be kept secret. Shen discovered it and gathered many people to chase to the boat port and led the girl back. He now plans to file a formal lawsuit for termination of the contract.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Dispute Over Feast Donations Continues: Qian Zhongliang, the head of the First District Office, is levying autonomous feast donations within the district based on the Township Autonomy Implementation Law to supplement the district's township autonomy expenses. However, Lu Renshou, the head of the county's Education Bureau, believes this overlaps with the bureau's plan to collect feast donations, and has intervened. This has led to ongoing disputes between the two parties that remain unresolved. Yesterday, more than ten people, including Wan Boying, the deputy head of the Zhen (township), and Yao Ganshi, the Zhen's secretary, from the First District Office, submitted a petition to Director Chen of the Provincial Department. They cited a newspaper report regarding the Education Department's approval of the district's collection of autonomous feast donations, which contained language such as "(under the pretext of delineating boundaries, attempting to seize authority and disrupt the administrative system, order the county to stop it)." They requested that the director withdraw the restraining order, allowing local autonomy to be realized.</p>
<p>Lake Bandit Huang Dezhang Arrested and Brought to Wuxi for Trial: A large-scale robbery and kidnapping by lake bandits occurred in Xueyanqiao Township, at the border of Wuxi and Changzhou, last winter.

<p>The Problem of Whether to Abolish the Local Security System: The provincial government has decided to abolish the existing local security system in all counties. Chen Liangdong, the head of the Finance Bureau of this county, was ordered to implement this decision. However, although the district heads of this county have been selected, the neighborhood chiefs have not been fully appointed. Abolishing the local security system at this time would undoubtedly affect the collection of land taxes. After assessing the situation, it seems necessary to temporarily postpone the abolition. Yesterday, he specifically explained the difficulties in a petition to the Department of Civil Affairs and Finance, requesting instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Funding Secured for Dredging the Canal: Various organizations in Wujin County plan to dredge the Wujin section of the Tuyang Canal, along with the South Canal and the Menghe River, to improve transportation.

<p>Bandit Suppression Unit Arrests Bandit Spy: Zhang Hanbing, a bandit spy from Sheng County, was found in possession of two pistols and 107 rounds of ammunition by soldiers of the Fourth District Bandit Suppression Command on the Yong-Shao railway at the end of last month.

He initially made a living by stealing, but joined the bandit party last year to work as a spy.

<h3>Ministry of Education Reports on the Handling of Resolutions from the Second Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Central Executive Committee's Third Plenary Session convened on March 1st. All resolutions regarding work during the Tutelage Period passed by the Second Plenary Session should be reported by the responsible organizations for statistical review. The following is a summary of the Ministry of Education's report on the handling of the resolutions:</p>
<p>(1) (Strictly Enforce National Compulsory Education and Adult Literacy Education) Regarding the strict enforcement of national compulsory education, a plan for implementing compulsory education has been drafted. It is proposed to establish 1,500 compulsory education pilot districts in cities and villages within the next five years, so that important counties across the country can begin small-scale experiments in compulsory education. It is also planned to implement four years of compulsory education nationwide in the twentieth year, so that 40 million children across the country can receive education. Adult literacy education is divided into civic literacy training and vocational training. A preliminary plan for implementing adult literacy education has been drafted, with the goal of completing civic literacy training within the six-year Tutelage Period. An order was issued on July 1, 1930, announcing that all citizens must complete the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Reader by the end of December 1936. Compulsory implementation will begin in cities, towns, and villages of the capital on January 1, 1931. Compulsory implementation will begin in cities, towns, and villages of provincial capitals on January 1, 1932. Compulsory implementation will begin in cities, towns, and villages of first-class and second-class counties on January 1, 1934. Compulsory implementation will begin in cities, towns, and villages of third-class counties on January 1, 1936. The preliminary plan will be completed by the end of December 1936. As for vocational training, an implementation plan will be formulated after the National Education Conference approves the National Education Plan, referring to the vocational education sections of the secondary education and social education plans.</p>
<p>(2) (Consolidate and Develop Education) 1. Regarding the convening of the National Education Conference, the Ministry organized the Education Plan Drafting Committee in October 1929 to draft the National Education Plan. After several meetings and discussions, ten draft plans have been prepared, covering party doctrine education, compulsory education, adult literacy education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, social education, normal education, overseas Chinese education, and Mongolian and Tibetan education. The drafts are currently being compiled for submission to the National Education Conference. In January of this year, the Ministry appointed preparatory committee members for the National Education Conference and organized a committee to handle the preparations. It has been decided that the National Education Conference will be convened on April 15th of this year. 2. Regarding the establishment of an Education Hall in the capital, the Ministry drafted the General Outline for the Organization of the Central Education Hall in September 1929 and designated the Chaotian Palace as the site of the Central Education Hall. People were sent to survey and map the area in preparation for construction. However, the estimated cost is quite large. Due to ongoing military conflicts and insufficient treasury funds, the national financial resources do not seem to be available at this time, so the project could not be completed as scheduled. However, efforts are still being made to collect educational achievements and educational books and supplies from home and abroad for display.</p>
<p>(3) (Terminate the Pilot University District System) Regarding the termination of the pilot University District System, the Ministry submitted the proposal to the Executive Yuan meeting in July 1929. It was proposed that the Peking University District and Zhejiang University District be terminated during the summer vacation, and the Central University District be terminated by the end of 1929. The proposal was approved and ordered to be implemented. Subsequently, the president of the Peking University District replied that the district would be terminated on July 1st. The president of the Zhejiang University District reported that the district would be terminated at the end of July. The president of the Central University District reported that the district would be terminated on September 1st. The University District System has been completely abolished.</p>
<p>(4) (Regarding the Resolutions on Mongolia and Tibet, (3) Establishing a Department in the Ministry of Education Specifically Responsible for Mongolian and Tibetan Education) The Ministry established the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department in November 1929, specifically responsible for Mongolian education affairs. The Mongolian and Tibetan Education Survey Form has been prepared and sent to Qinghai, Ningxia, Xikang, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, and various Mongolian and Tibetan leagues and banners for detailed investigation and reporting. After the results of this survey are submitted to the Ministry, the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Plan drafted by the Education Plan Drafting Committee and various implementation plans will be used to implement the plan in stages, taking into account local conditions. In addition, the Ministry has ordered the Central University to establish Mongolian and Tibetan classes starting in 1930, so that outstanding Mongolian and Tibetan students can pursue advanced studies. The Ministry is also working with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to establish the Nanjing Mongolian and Tibetan School, the Kangding Mongolian and Tibetan School, and the Tibetan Student Remedial School attached to the Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing. All of the above work is currently in active progress.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Education Appoints Representatives to Attend the National Education Conference</h3>
<p>Lu Dianyong, Chief of the Education Section of the Hangzhou Municipal Government</p>
<p>The National Education Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Beijing on April 10th. However, due to insufficient preparation and the fact that representatives from various provinces have not yet been fully appointed, it has been postponed to April 15th. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has decided to appoint Lu Dianyong, Chief of the Education Section of the Hangzhou Municipal Government, as the general representative of all cities and counties in the province. Lu will leave for Beijing on April 12th, carrying proposals to attend the conference.</p>
<h3>Measures for the Exchange of Publications Between China and Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the measures for the exchange of publications between China and Czechoslovakia, stating that: "Last December, this ministry approved your ministry's letter forwarding a letter from the representative of the Czechoslovakian government, stating that the Oriental Institute was seeking publications and statistical bulletins on the economic, agricultural, commercial, and social conditions of China, and inquiring whether Chinese social organizations were willing to exchange publications with the institute. After this ministry forwarded the letter separately, the Academia Sinica replied that it should directly contact the Academia Sinica's International Exchange of Publications. This ministry has already informed them of this. Now, the replies from various universities, academic institutions, and organizations, such as National Tsinghua, National Jinan, private Jinling, Xiamen University, Shanghai University, National Peking Research Institute, Chinese Scientific Society, Chinese Forestry Society, and Academic Research Association, all indicate their willingness to exchange publications with the institute. However, the exchange procedures are inconsistent, with some preferring direct exchange and others requesting this ministry's assistance, which is not appropriate. This ministry proposes to follow the measures for the exchange of publications between China and Poland in your ministry's letter No. 9, that is, to designate the International Exchange Office of the Academia Sinica in Shanghai as the official agency for receiving and sending publications between China and Czechoslovakia. First, your ministry should inform the representative of the Czechoslovakian government and instruct the institute to send the publications they wish to exchange directly to the Academia Sinica in Shanghai for mutual exchange. If your ministry deems this feasible, please reply so that this ministry can entrust the Academia Sinica and inform various universities, etc."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education Outlines Popular Lecture Program</h3>
<p>The dropouts among Shanghai citizens, in addition to farmers and coolies, mostly come from workers from various places, and the younger siblings of workers. According to the statistics of dropouts from various municipal schools in the seventeenth year, job seekers accounted for more than a quarter of them. It can be seen that there are many dropouts. The Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education is seeking to remedy the dropouts of citizens, with supplementary schools and literacy campaigns, but dropouts regard time as gold. Supplementary school cannot provide literacy. Therefore, there is an organization of popular lecture groups, and the plan is drawn up as follows: (1) This plan is based on the lecture outline of the bureau's popular lecture group. It seeks to give citizens a considerable understanding of the important common sense in daily life. (1) In addition to the members of this group, lecturers will be requested by the director to order the faculty, staff, and students of various municipal schools to join this group and take turns giving lectures. The rotation schedule will be set separately. (1) The lecture period is divided into fixed and temporary. In addition to Saturdays as the fixed lecture period, if temporary problems occur, this group will notify each school to send out lecturers. (1) The lecture locations are in 15 districts in the Hubei South Zhabei area, which are specified at any time, limited to villages and towns, and rotated each time for general coverage. (1) In addition to the materials provided by this group at any time, each school may formulate its own, but it must be limited to the outline of the lectures of this group. (1) If you want to arouse the interest of the audience during the lecture, you can use movies, phonographs, or add performance to weaken the lecture, etc. (1) The lecturer's attitude towards the audience should be based on gentleness and sincerity. (1) After each lecture, a report on the actual situation of the lecture must be filled out and reported to this group. If a lecture manuscript is to be prepared, the original outline must be sent to this group. The actual situation form will be set separately.</p>

<p>Telegram Received: The Peiping Sports Federation has telephoned the National Games Preparatory Office, stating: "The meeting date is approaching, the Peiping Municipal Government has no preparations, and the schools in the city have not received your office's notice, causing many excellent athletes to be unable to participate, which is regrettable.

<h3>(4) Zhejiang Police Academy Prepares to Participate</h3>

<p>International Basketball Game</p>
<p>Women's····Federal 24 vs. 17 Victory over China</p>
<p>Men's····United States 76 vs. 17 Victory over Korea</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, the Shanghai International Basketball Tournament featured one women's and one men's game. In the women's game, the Federal team played against the Chinese team, starting at 6 p.m. The Federal team won with a score of 24 to 17. The referee was Mr. Smith. In the men's game, the United States played against Korea. The United States won overwhelmingly with a score of 76 to 17. The referee was Mr. Smith.</p>
<h3>Federal Wins Over China····24 to 17</h3>
<p>The most prominent difference between the two teams' basketball skills lies in the quality of their coordination and the speed of their movements. The outcome of the game depended on this. Although the Chinese team had good players, they lacked coordination, especially the guards who appeared flustered. The Federal team fought bravely. Miss Jie Hansheng, the center, was extraordinarily agile and rarely seen. Under pressure, the Chinese team only had the upper hand twice, at 4-2 and 7-6. Otherwise, they were always inferior to the Federal team. The closest score was 19-17 in the second half, with only two points behind, showing a great momentum to rise. Unexpectedly, the Federal team's momentum was overwhelming, and the Chinese guards were negligent. The Federal team took the lead again. The Chinese team was unable to rally, and the Federal team won with a score of 24 to 17. In the first half, the Federal team scored 13 points, and the Chinese team scored 11 points. The scores for each quarter were 6-5, 7-6, 6-2, and 5-4, with the Federal team leading in each quarter.</p>

<h3>Four Universities Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>Jinling Won Over Soochow Yesterday</p>
<p>Result: 48 to 38</p>
<p>Soochow vs. Shanghai University Tomorrow at 4 PM</p>
<p>Shanghai University is Likely to Secure This Year's Championship</p>
<p>The Four Universities Basketball Tournament was held yesterday afternoon at 3 PM in the Shanghai University gymnasium. The teams competing were Jinling against Soochow. The referee was Zhang Guoxun. The result of the game was 48 to 28, with Jinling winning. Tomorrow at 4 PM, Shanghai University will play against Soochow in the final match. The referee will be Mr. Smith.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University is Likely to Secure the Championship</h3>
<p>Before the start of this year's triangular basketball tournament among the four universities, the athletes of all three schools were actively preparing, hoping to win the championship and bring glory to their alma mater. The different mentalities of each team led to varying observations. Although Shanghai University had the highest expectations, there were concerns due to the injury of Captain He, which would inevitably reduce their chances. Moreover, Jinling had a long-standing reputation, and Soochow had a talented team. It was uncertain who would emerge victorious. However, after Shanghai University's decisive victory over Jinling, their ambition to win the championship again was ignited. With Jinling's victory over Soochow yesterday, it seems almost certain that this year's championship will still belong to Shanghai University. After the two matches, the strength of each team is clear, and the winner of the championship is also implicitly known. Therefore, there is no need to wait for the final match between Shanghai University and Soochow.</p>
<h3>Jinling Has an Average Team</h3>
<p>In my previous report on the Jinling-Shanghai University basketball game, I mentioned that the Jinling players have good qualities, but their movements are slow. In yesterday's performance, they were much better than before, with quick advances and retreats, and internal and external coordination. As a result, Soochow was controlled, leading to their defeat. All five players in the starting lineup contributed, making them a truly average team.</p>
<h3>Soochow's Formation is Dispersed</h3>
<p>The Soochow team is composed of talented players from the Soochow and Shanghai schools. However, the two teams have had no opportunity for joint training, so it is appropriate that each team acts on its own and there is no possibility of cooperation. Judging from the individual performances, several players can be compared to Jinling. Therefore, in the first ten minutes, the scores were repeatedly tied, and the teams were evenly matched. However, when the formation was dispersed, the team suffered an irreversible defeat.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Intense Battle Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>Jinling took the lead with a strong attack. Tu Zhongqi and Li Zao scored successively. Soochow fought back vigorously. The three forwards attacked from the left and right. Soon, the score was tied at 5-5. The scores of both sides seemed to be advancing on the same level. Although Soochow was able to take the lead first, Jinling followed closely. Suddenly, Soochow's internal and external formations were disrupted, and the formation was dispersed. Jinling took this opportunity to advance greatly, and the score soared, taking the lead. In the first half, Jinling scored 23 points, and Soochow scored 17 points. In the second half, Soochow scored first, boosting their spirits. However, a group of uncoordinated troops often have selfish motives. Soochow was unable to avoid missing opportunities. Therefore, when Jinling was at its peak, they displayed their agile skills and cooperative efforts, doing everything possible to win. However, Soochow also relied on their individual strength to cope. Therefore, although they were defeated, the difference was still close. The result of the game was 48 to 28, with Jinling winning.</p>

<h3>The Danish Crown Prince Can Arrive Today</h3>
<p>Can Arrive at the New Customs Wharf at 4 PM</p>
<p>Chinese and Danish Officials Prepare to Welcome with Courtesy</p>
<p>The Danish Crown Prince, Prince, Princess and others, a party of seven, are traveling to China on the Feivonia steamship. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9 a.m. this morning, the steamship was delayed due to fog. The Danish Consulate General in Shanghai received a wireless report from the ship yesterday stating that the journey would be delayed until 3 or 4 p.m. today before arriving in port and still landing at the New Customs Wharf. China's reception ceremony is quite grand. The Songkou warship will fire a salute when the steamship enters the port. The military band of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters will play music at the New Customs Wharf when the Danish Prince disembarks.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Tariff Negotiations Continued Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Meeting Scheduled to be Convened Again Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>All Sino-Japanese Tariffs Can Be Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Negotiations on Selected Reciprocal Goods</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese tariff negotiations continued yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. at the Information Office. Those present on the Chinese side were Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, and Xu Mo, Director of the European and American Affairs Department. Those present on the Japanese side were Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, Secretary Horinouchi Kanjō, and Commercial Officer Yokotake. The meeting adjourned at 7:15 p.m. The details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reciprocal Goods The discussions yesterday were still about the selection of reciprocal goods, and the various articles agreed upon the previous day were sorted out and the wording was revised. All types of luxury goods were not included in the main part of the reciprocal goods. The main parts were several types of cotton yarn. When the Japanese side initially proposed it, there were as many as hundreds of types, but after repeated protests from the Chinese side, the number has been reduced to dozens. The Chinese side still insists on reducing it to a minimum of ten to twenty types. However, as for the entirety of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, after yesterday's consultation, the opinions of both parties have converged, and the date of formal resolution is not far away.</p>
<p>Continued Discussion Tomorrow Morning After the meeting adjourned, Mr. Wang Zhengting told our reporter that today's meeting was a big step forward compared to the previous ones. The issue of selecting reciprocal goods was resolved within this meeting and will no longer be handled by a special committee. It is scheduled to continue to be discussed here on the morning of the 10th. It is expected that the entire Sino-Japanese tariff agreement can be agreed upon and brought to a close at that time. After Shigemitsu asks the Japanese government for approval, it can be formally signed.</p>
<p>Reciprocal Tariff Rates Mr. Wang also said that the meaning of the reciprocal tariff rates, which have been repeatedly discussed with the Japanese side, is slightly different. The so-called reciprocal tariff rates refer to the amount of tariff reduction within the scope of specific reciprocal goods. However, in the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement currently under discussion, the so-called reciprocal goods do not have a tariff reduction, but rather a specific tariff rate that both countries jointly abide by.</p>
<p>Discussions Between Finance Minister Song Ziwen, yesterday told our reporter that the opinions of both parties on the points discussed today have gradually converged. It is not surprising that there are also such agreements on reciprocal tariff rates with the UK and the US, and other countries will definitely not request to follow the example. Japan's situation is slightly different because it has not signed tariff autonomy. In terms of the substance of reciprocal tariff rates, Japan seems to have a slight advantage over other countries. The Chinese side insists on reducing the number of reciprocal goods as much as possible, and negotiations are still underway. When asked when the new tariff rules will be implemented, he replied that according to recent customs statistics, import tariffs have been reduced, so the implementation of the new tariff rules still needs to be considered.</p>
<h3>March 8th Women's Day</h3>
<p>Commemoration Meeting Record</p>
<p>Yesterday was International Women's Day. The Municipal Women's Association held a commemoration meeting at the Chamber of Commerce Assembly Hall at 2 PM. Over two thousand representatives from all walks of life, including Tang Demin and other women, gathered together, making for a grand occasion. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Organizations: Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, District Party Headquarters, District Women's Associations, Women's Relief Society, Women's Temperance Society, District Court, Provisional Court, Chamber of Commerce Assembly, Franco-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai County Government, Garrison Headquarters, First District Public Security Bureau, Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, Women's Reformatory, "Cultural China Monthly" magazine, Rongchang, East District, Zhenhua, Jinghu Railway, Hunnan Sanitation, British American Tobacco, Construction Industry, Xiehou, Wharf, Zhabei Silk Factory and other labor unions, Anhui Shanghai Youth Association, China Four Prohibitions Association, Liangjiang, Peiming, Renhe, Wuben, Aiqun, Yude, Pengpu, Huiqiao, Shangwen, Xinmin, Chamber of Commerce, Qiying, Zhicheng, Bowen, Minsheng, Tangwan, Haishan, Jiangjing, Bide, Shuji schools,</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) Opening, (2) All Stand, (3) Sing the Party Song, (4) Pay the Highest Respects to the Party's National Flag and the Portrait of the Premier, (5) Respectfully Read the Premier's Will, (6) Silent Mourning, (7) Chairman's Speech, (8) Speech by Representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, (9) Speeches, (10) Sing the March 8th Commemoration Song, (11) Shout Slogans, (12) Entertainment, (13) Adjournment,</p>
<p>Meeting Staff: Chairman Lin Kecong, Recorders Shen Jingcun, Hu Yanyun, Master of Ceremonies Chen Zhenquan, Head of Reception Zhang Shufei, Deputy Head Huang Daping, Head of Affairs Huang Mali, Deputy Head Xu Lanying, Head of Entertainment Ma Zhiying, Deputy Head Lu Yunsheng, Head of Arrangement Zhou Lihua, Deputy Head Peng Yongjie</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Lin Kecong delivered the opening speech, roughly stating: Since the liberation movement demanded by American women on March 8th, eleven years ago, women in various countries have gradually begun to be liberated. In China, Chinese women, influenced by this trend, have gradually gained liberation due to their awakening, but the majority of peasant women and female workers are still trapped in the shackles and oppression of feudal patriarchal forces and backward production and insecure living conditions. When we commemorate March 8th, we should strive for the liberation of all women. This is the first meaning of our commemoration. In the world, since March 8th, 1909, women have gradually been liberated in name, but in reality, only a part of the upper-class women, the majority of working women, are still in a state of oppression. When we commemorate March 8th, we must advance the liberation of all women in the world. This is the first meaning of our commemoration.</p>
<p>Guest Speakers: Chen Dezheng delivered a speech on behalf of Xu Xingchu, roughly stating that as the meeting was not scheduled to begin until today, many attendees have already arrived, which shows everyone's enthusiasm for the women's movement. In the past, the women's movement had many weaknesses. First, it only focused on upper-class women and ignored the working women of the lower classes. Second, it only focused on individual activities and forgot the common interests of the women's masses. Third, it only paid attention to external social activities and forgot the important work within the family. From these three points, we can conclude the future direction of the women's movement. The most important thing is (1) to be under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, (2) to pay attention to the actual liberation of the lower-class working women, (3) to pay attention to the widespread expansion of female education, and (4) to pay attention to the common attainment of independent economic life for women. He also sharply criticized the current family life, hoping that women with clear minds can cultivate themselves, improve family life, and pay attention to the ideological and physical liberation of women themselves, hoping to rationalize life and promote the (natural breastfeeding) movement. In addition, Municipal Government Representative Chen Kecheng and First District Party Headquarters Representative Zhu Shujian also delivered speeches successively. Details are omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Meeting Proposals: (1) Female workers should rest during the production period for (four) weeks with full wages paid. (Resolution) Submitted to party and government agencies. (2) Please ask all agencies to employ female staff as much as possible. (Resolution) Passed. (3) Expanding the women's movement proposal. (Resolution) Submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters for submission to the Central Government.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans: (1) Commemorate the glorious and great March 8th. (2) Women, under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, unite. (3) Eradicate feudal patriarchal forces. (4) Down with imperialism.</p>
<p>Speech by Representative of the Party Headquarters: Municipal Executive Committee Representative Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, roughly stating that the women of the world have gradually begun to be liberated since March 8th, 1909. Chinese women, under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, have also begun to be liberated. Although they cannot be completely liberated, they are gradually moving towards the path of liberation. This is a fact. For example, women's right to inherit property, etc., has been implemented in law. If women want to be completely liberated, they must rise up themselves, continue to work hard, and Chinese women should pay attention to the fact that the Chinese women's movement is related to the Chinese national liberation movement and the National Revolution. The success of the Chinese revolution is the liberation of Chinese women. Therefore, Chinese women should work together with all the people to devote themselves to the National Revolution. Secondly, the prerequisite for women's liberation is the issue of education, because economic independence, etc., is entirely based on women receiving full education and having sufficient intelligence, etc. Next, a speech was given by Xu Yefu, representative of the Citizen Training Association (omitted).</p>
<h3>Disturbances on March 8th</h3>
<p>Trolleybus Windows Smashed</p>
<p>More Than Ten Youths Detained in Police Station</p>
<p>Yesterday was the International Women's Day. The Chinese and concession areas stepped up their precautions in advance, but some people still distributed leaflets and smashed tram windows in the concession. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau and the police force were able to provide effective protection, and they were soon dispersed and more than ten ringleaders were arrested.</p>
<p>Chinese Area: Yesterday at about 11:00 AM, near Nanyang Bridge, young men, holding reactionary leaflets, distributed them along the way. At the same time, gunshots were heard. Wang, the director of the Second District Public Security Bureau, ordered the police to go and disperse the crowd after receiving the news. However, because the situation was quite urgent, the police also fired three shots into the sky, and the young men fled to the concession area. Zhang Guohui, Lin Hanchang, Li Zutang, Gu Jinji, and other four people were arrested by the police. However, when the young men fired their guns, the overcoat of Yang Daocen, a patrolman of the Second District Public Security Bureau, was hit by a stray bullet on the left lapel. There were two bullet holes at the bottom. Fortunately, the flesh was not injured. After Zhang, Lin, and other four people were arrested, the Songshan Road Police Station in the French Concession sent Shi Dejun and Gan Xing to the Public Security Bureau. It is said that they were also related to the disturbances. Among them, Gan Xing was shot in the left leg. He claimed that he was shot while walking to the intersection of Avenue du Billet in the French Concession. The age and origin of each person arrested are as follows: Zhang Guohui, 19 years old, from Guangdong; Lin Hanchang, 18 years old, from Guangxi; Li Zutang, 18 years old, from Guangxi. The above three people all claimed to be studying at China Public School in Wusong. Gu Jinji, 25 years old, from Haimen, works as a rickshaw puller. Shi Dejun, 17 years old, from Xuzhou, claims to be studying at an art university. Gan Xing, 18 years old, from</p>

The Old Gate Police Station dispatched police immediately to disperse the crowd. Near Fujian Road and Avenue Edward VII, three people were arrested. However, two trolleybus windows were smashed by the crowd during the disturbance. Later, the police and others continued to arrest several people at the corner of Fujian Road and Jiujiang Road and on Tibet Road. Those who fled into the French Concession were also arrested. At about 10:45 AM, someone was distributing leaflets in the area of Avenue Edward VII and Tibet Road again.</p>
<h3>External Telegram Reply to the National Products Maintenance Association</h3>
<p>There are No Reciprocal Provisions for Sino-Japanese Tariffs</p>
<p>The Chinese National Products Maintenance Association had previously telegraphed the ministry, arguing that the Sino-Japanese Reciprocity Agreement was detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and urged it not to be signed hastily. Now, the association has received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reads: Shanghai Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, We acknowledge receipt of your telegram. After investigation, the draft agreement proposed by our side in the current Sino-Japanese revision conference does not contain any reciprocal provisions regarding tariff matters. As for the full text of the new treaty, it is still under negotiation and cannot be copied and sent at this time. Reply, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (seal).</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Federation Strives to Prevent Japanese Oppression of Chinese Goods</h3>
<p>Please Government Pay Attention to the Revision of Sino-Japanese Tariffs</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China previously received a telegram from the Korean Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, stating that Chinese goods were subject to heavy tariffs by Japanese customs and various abuses by customs officials. Yesterday, the association sent telegrams to the National Government, requesting them to make every effort to negotiate during the Sino-Japanese tariff revision. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, We recently received a telegram from the Korean Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, which reads: (Omission). Accordingly, Japanese customs impose heavy taxes on Chinese goods transported to Korea. At the 17th National Congress of Chambers of Commerce, the General Chamber of Commerce, etc., submitted a proposal, which was resolved and approved, and submitted to your government for joint handling by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Now that Sino-Japanese tariffs are being negotiated, if serious negotiations are not proposed at this time, we fear that Chinese goods transported to Korea will always be subject to heavy taxes and will inevitably disappear, which is extremely important to the national and international industry and commerce. The previous report is hereby telegraphed, and we request your government to investigate and verify, and earnestly request you to conduct serious negotiations based on reason, one is to abolish the heavy tax on Chinese goods transported to Korea and restore the old tariff rate before the ninth year of the Republic, and the other is to protect Chinese residing in Korea, whether they are studying, doing business, or traveling, and their travel and residence shall be absolutely free and shall not be subject to harsh treatment outside of treaties and laws. This case is a matter of life and death for Chinese residing in Korea, and we earnestly request your attention and strive to achieve the goal. We are extremely eager to await orders. The Japanese Customs Heavy Tax Table is attached. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Yu Guangxu, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, etc. Koutou, Yu Yin.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Association's Opinion on the Far East Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Hope Not to Be Used by Ambitious Countries</p>
<p>Stop Opium Monopoly in Various Parts of the Far East</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency said that the Far East Investigation Team had come to Shanghai. Yesterday, Chinese and Western newspapers reported that the chairman of the team, Mr. A克斯, stated that the reason for this trip was that it was not invited by our country in advance and that our country's opium situation was untuned. The reporter thought that this matter was related to the international community and was very important. He specially visited the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association to ask what its position was on this statement. The following is a record: (Question) Is the Far East Investigation Team's statement that it will not investigate China the result of our government and your association's opposition in the past? (Answer) When the British representative proposed this organization in the League of Nations, our representative did not refuse to include China in the investigation. Our position (1) The personnel of the investigation team should be participated by Chinese representatives, (2) The investigation area should not be limited to the Far East (3) The scope of the investigation should include narcotic drugs, not only opium. This time the team came to China and stated that it would not investigate China or it was caused by not obtaining our country's consent. (Question) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the team's statement that it will not investigate our country for our country? (Answer) Our country is not not advocating not being investigated. The reasons have been said before. If the investigation team conducts an investigation without our country's consent, the result will inevitably be a false statement that our country's ban on smoking is ineffective, and will falsely cover up the facts in order to deceive international hearing. The opium imperialists will then be able to base this absurd theory on extending the opium monopoly policy of various subordinates. Now that it is not being investigated, all the unfounded reports to the League of Nations regarding the opium problem in our country will naturally avoid the situation of the above-mentioned false accusations, and the opium imperialists will have no excuse. (Question) The members of the team are all from neutral countries in the area of opium, that is, they are appointed by countries that have a very significant relationship with opium. Will the results of their investigation in areas other than our country not be biased? (Answer) The team has already investigated India, Annam, Ceylon, Malaya, the Philippines, Hong Kong, etc., or are opium producing areas or opium monopoly areas. The colonial governments of the Nanyang Islands collect opium tax, which is known to the world. The cruelty of overseas Chinese being poisoned is also a very clear fact. The investigation team is a representative of a neutral country and has visited the countries during this period. It will definitely be able to report the actual situation in various places to the League of Nations in a just and humane manner. Regarding this point, we also very much hope that the team will pay special attention to the results of the team's investigation in various places and be able to control the opium monopoly in various parts of the Far East without being used by ambitious countries to extend its opium policy. (Question) Will you have any comments on going to Dalian and other places in the future? (Answer) This association has previously sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation of the Japanese leased land in Dalian and other places. The Japanese manage the opium monopoly. The association has obtained a lot of materials, which should be contributed to the team for reference during the investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Consults with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Eradicate Meningitis</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate the outbreak of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in Baoshan and Songjiang near the city. It has immediately distributed various printed materials for prevention and lectures and propaganda, and carried out preventive injections in Xinzhuang. Details have been reported in previous reports. It is reported that the Baoshan and Songjiang county district offices have sent letters to the bureau requesting them to send personnel to carry out preventive injections. The bureau has already assigned all the current personnel to work within the city, and cannot transfer them. Moreover, the original funding is limited and has already been allocated for use, and there is no way to transfer it. Due to factual limitations, it is impossible to take care of everything. A report has been submitted to the Municipal Government for instructions. The Municipal Government believes that epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis is extremely contagious, and if it is not eradicated as soon as possible, the spread is worrying. It has reported the situation to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and requested that it immediately order its subordinates to send personnel to eradicate it.</p>

<h3>Pu Song District Police Regiment Intercepts a Large Gang of Bandits</h3>
<p>Successively Capturing Twenty-Two Bandits</p>
<p>Seizing Nine Pistols and One Stolen Boat</p>
<p>The Pu Song District Defense Corps, after cooperating with the Public Security Bureau to capture a large gang of bandits the night before last, learned that bandits were lurking near the district. The corps then issued orders to all teams and defense posts to advance their patrols, to conduct close investigation at all times, and to prevent any remaining bandits from causing trouble. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau notified all police stations.</p>
<p>After receiving orders to arrest suspects, the Zhang Jiang Du defense post of the Defense Corps's first team immediately advanced its patrol. At 6 PM on the previous day, the team was patrolling on Beiyasi Road when they suddenly saw more than ten people coming from the east. The team members, finding them suspicious, prepared in advance. Unexpectedly, the bandits appeared timid when they saw the team members, which made the team members even more suspicious. They immediately went forward to question them, but the bandits, becoming frightened, fled. Five of them were caught and escorted to the Corps headquarters by Squad Leader Xu. After questioning by the Corps Commander, one, He Yuren, one, Wang Yiren, one, Liu Yucai, one, Yu Tongrong, and one, Wang Zhifu, offered cunning alibis. The Corps, believing they were related to the previously captured bandits, handed them over to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>
<p>Municipal Committee Member Commands After arriving at the home of Wang Yifu, second platoon leader of the third team of the Defense Corps in Zhuangjiajing, Pu Song District Municipal Committee Member Chen Ya Fu was attending a wedding there yesterday afternoon. As he arrived, he heard gunshots everywhere. He quickly learned that the police corps at Futian Temple in the north and Huacao Ferry in the south were exchanging fire with bandits. After hearing the alarm, the committee member immediately summoned Platoon Leader Wang to lead the local Defense Corps in assisting in the arrest. The committee member personally went to direct the operation. Seeing that they were being attacked by the Defense Corps from the middle, the bandits scattered and fled. As a result, the Huacao Corps police captured fifteen people, and recovered a stolen boat in the Wu Song River, inside of which they found eight pistols and over one thousand rounds of ammunition. The corps police collectively sent them to the No. 1 branch of the No. 6 District Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Second Corps Jointly Arrests After receiving orders, the fourth team of the district Defense Corps dispatched Team Leader Qian Haibo and special assignment Squad Leaders Zhang Dazhong, Yao Shaobo, Liu Shunqing, and others at approximately 4 PM yesterday to lead several team members to patrol the Wu Song River area. When they arrived at Xianglangdu, they saw suspicious figures passing by on the south bank in groups of two or three. They immediately questioned them from across the river. Unexpectedly, the bandits on the opposite bank suddenly produced Mauser pistols and fired repeatedly. The squad leaders and others immediately crossed the river and surrounded them. The bandits retreated while firing. The team members courageously pursued them for over ten miles. The bandits crossed seven or eight rivers, nearing Zhuzhai. The third team of the Defense Corps in that area arrived after hearing the alarm and worked together with the team leader Zhu Qinyuan and others to capture them, resulting in the capture of one bandit, and recovered a six-inch pistol and three rounds of live ammunition. Team Leader Zhu Qinyuan of the third team prepared a document and dispatched Jin Xihua and Sun Yamei to escort them to Corps headquarters. At the same time, Squad Leader Zhang Dazhong captured one person near Xinjianong. Subsequently, team member Zhang Yutian encircled from the south, met with Squad Leader Pan Shenggui of the first detachment of the third team, and jointly captured a bandit boat with the Public Security Bureau. The bandit captured by the fourth team yesterday morning was escorted to Corps headquarters by Team Leader Qian. After a joint interrogation by Corps Commander Shen and Deputy Corps Commander Hou, one, Wang Gongchun, from Yangzhou, had gunshot wounds, and one, Lü Wenlian, from Jiangbei, confessed to having a major relationship with the captured bandits. Wang Gongchun could not deny that a pistol had been found on him. Corps headquarters is currently preparing a document to submit to superiors for punishment.</p>
<p>Joint Defense Notice We respectfully inform you that a large gang of bandits has recently appeared in this district. Although they have been successfully cracked down on in advance, the escaped bandits are scattered, ambushes are frequent, the remaining evildoers have not been eliminated, and future troubles are concerning. If we do not strengthen our defenses, it will be insufficient to maintain peace. In view of this, our office has specially decided to hold a meeting at 1 PM on March 10 at the Municipal Committee Member's Office to discuss joint defense measures. We hope that you will take time out of your busy schedule to attend and jointly plan for peace. This is of utmost importance. Addressed to all agencies, organizations, and directors. Jointly issued by the Pu Song District Municipal Committee Member's Office, the No. 1 branch of the No. 6 District Public Security Bureau, and the Pu Song District Defense Corps Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Gun Murder Case on Song Park Road</h3>
<p>The Deceased Was a Detective's Associate</p>
<p>Shot Eight or Nine Times</p>
<p>The area around Song Park Road in Zhabei is extremely desolate, and assassinations occur from time to time. Yesterday morning, another male corpse was found in the wasteland north of Yongxing Road on Song Park Road. He was about thirty years old, wearing a navy blue fake worsted camel hair robe, a black cloth long gown on the outside, worsted pants, worsted shoes, rubber overshoes, and a black duckbill cap. He was initially discovered by a passerby, who reported to the No. 2 branch of the No. 5 District Public Security Bureau. The Bureau ordered the local bailiff Wang Shaoting to report to the local court for an inquest. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Wang arrived at the scene for an inquest. He saw two gunshot wounds to the left temple of the deceased's head and seven or eight gunshot wounds to his waist and legs. It was determined that he had been shot to death before his death. According to knowledgeable sources, the deceased was Fan Longfu, who had served as an associate for a certain detective in the concession police force. This assassination was likely due to a long-standing feud. It was also said that the time of the murder was probably midnight, as villagers heard many gunshots.</p>
<p>Cohabitation Lawsuit Becomes Unconditional Divorce</p>
<p>Better to Divorce Than Force Cohabitation</p>
<p>Both Parties Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>Settlement Reached in Court</p>
<p>Lu Jianian, currently employed at the Jiangnan Shipyard, recently hired lawyer Ye Shengchao to file a lawsuit for cohabitation in the local court. The suit stated that on April 12 of the lunar year before last, Lu married Feng Lianwen, the daughter of Feng Runtin from Zhoupu Town in Pudong. They initially lived in harmony, but since Feng returned to Ningbo, she repeatedly refused to return to the shared household. Lu had no choice but to sue according to the law. The defendant, Feng Lianwen, also hired lawyer Zhu Fang to file a defense. Several hearings were held, but because there was still a need to call witnesses, the case was not concluded. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held by Judge Ge. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court as summoned. Feng Lianwen's father, Feng Runtin, testified that he strongly supported his son-in-law's request for cohabitation. Feng Lianwen stated that cohabitation was possible, but that she required a monthly allowance of eighty yuan for living expenses. The plaintiff stated that his monthly salary was less than that amount and that he could only afford a monthly allowance of about ten yuan. The judge said to the defendant, "You don't need that much for your personal expenses." The defendant replied that this was the minimum. At this point, the plaintiff interjected, stating that when the defendant returned to Ningbo, she took two pearl hairpins, a gold Wenming bracelet, a gold base inlaid with jadeite buttons, and a gold pin. He requested that the court order her to bring them back. When questioned, the defendant stated that she only took one pearl hairpin, which she pawned for fifty yuan to pay for her studies. The judge observed that the two sides were at odds with each other and heading in opposite directions. The difference between them was too great for reconciliation. He then said to both parties, "It is better to divorce than to force cohabitation. It will save both parties from further altercations." The judge suggested an unconditional divorce, with neither party paying alimony. The plaintiff stated that divorce was possible, but that the jewelry she took must be returned. He stated that one of the large pearl hairpins had over two hundred pearls and was worth a considerable amount. Now the defendant denies taking the gold bracelet and other items, which shows that she had planned to embezzle them from the start. The defendant said, "After a divorce, the man can remarry, but how can the woman marry again?" The judge said, "That's not a problem. It's a trend now, and divorce is not unusual. Besides, you are both still young, so there's no need to worry about not finding a spouse." The judge repeatedly advised the plaintiff, who finally complied and waived the claim. Thus, a settlement was reached: an unconditional divorce. Both parties signed and left the court. Unexpectedly, the defendant started an argument as soon as she left the court. The defendant had borrowed several cheongsams and other items from the plaintiff's sister, which she had not returned for a long time. Seeing that the judge had granted the divorce, the plaintiff's sister asked her to return them. After a long dispute, the defendant agreed to return them after she returned home. The conflict finally ended.</p>
<p>A Humorous Western Romance</p>
<p>Sixteen-Year-Old Daughter Has a Lover</p>
<p>Father Resolutely Interferes</p>
<p>Two Sides Act Out Cohabitation of Love</p>
<p>Father Sues After Being Beaten During Visit</p>
<p>The Evening Post reported that Graham, a Danish caretaker at the Jiangbin Wharf General Association, was preventing his sixteen-year-old daughter from choosing her own husband. As a result, his daughter's lover, Max, hit him over the head with a beer bottle and was sued in the British Police Court this morning (8th). The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant, Max, was an employee of HSBC and was deeply in love with the plaintiff's daughter and vowed to marry her. However, under Danish law, parental consent is required for marriage, and the plaintiff refused to give his consent. The plaintiff also stated that his daughter had disappeared in January and was cohabitating with the defendant. He went to HSBC to question the defendant about his daughter's whereabouts. The defendant initially feigned ignorance but then agreed to accompany him. However, he made an excuse to get a hat and sneaked out through a side door, leaving him waiting for three quarters of an hour. Later, he was informed by others of his daughter's hiding place. He went with his wife to find her. After knocking on the door for about an hour, the daughter finally answered, but said that she only wanted to see her mother and not her father. Eventually, the mother and daughter came out together. He called for the defendant to open the door, but the defendant did not respond. He became angry and kicked down a door panel, and poked his head in. The defendant suddenly hit him over the head with a beer bottle, causing him to bleed profusely and almost die. He supported himself against the wall and went out into the road. Fortunately, a passing woman hired a car to take him to the hospital. He then passed out in the hospital for two hours. That afternoon, he reported the incident to the consul and issued a warrant for the defendant's arrest. This happened on February 22. Later, his daughter disappeared again. It was not until yesterday (7th), when the defendant was arrested at the Wu Song West Hotel, that he learned that she was cohabitating with the defendant again. The defendant's lawyer disputed the charges. The plaintiff admitted that he had severely beaten his daughter on one occasion, but did not know that his daughter was injured and hospitalized. He also denied borrowing a handgun from the defendant's neighbor to threaten him on the day of the incident, saying that he only wanted to enter the house and beat the defendant. The judge then ordered the defendant to post a bail of 500 yuan and find two British citizens to each post a bail of 250 yuan. The hearing was adjourned until the 11th.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Public Bus Company</p>
<p>Adds Special Buses for Arbor Day</p>
<p>From Laoximen to the Municipal Government Station</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, because the Municipal Government will hold an Arbor Day ceremony on March 12, the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, and a large number of people from various agencies and organizations will participate at that time, has ordered the South Shanghai Public Bus Company to dispatch special buses from 1 PM to 5 PM that afternoon, to travel back and forth from Laoximen to the Municipal Government building to meet this temporary need. It is reported that the company has decided to dispatch two special buses to pick up and drop off those participating in the Arbor Day ceremony, with Laoximen as the starting station, via Xieqiao, the Nanzhe Road intersection, and Guoriyun Bridge, to the Municipal Government. There are four stops in between, with each stop costing six cents and the entire line costing twenty-four cents. This special bus service is different from the regular bus service, so the previously established reduced-fare and free-fare preferential measures do not apply. This has been submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for approval and implementation. It is also reported that the Bureau has also consulted with the French Tram and Electric Light Company about the fact that all Route 21 buses will travel to Fenglin Bridge starting at 1 PM that afternoon, and will also add more vehicles to accommodate passengers.</p>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Plans to Install Traffic Lights</p>
<p>Traffic in this city is becoming increasingly complex, and the number of vehicles traveling in various prosperous streets and markets is increasing daily. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has long had a plan to install traffic lights. However, the use of these traffic lights is not to direct pedestrians and rickshaws, but to regulate the speed of vehicles. Otherwise, they may cause traffic chaos and be of no practical benefit. In order to determine the number of vehicles passing through each key intersection so as to plan the installation, the Bureau dispatched personnel to record the number of vehicles traveling through the Laoximen, Xiaodongmen, and Binshan Road intersections every day from 6 AM to 8 PM, starting on the 10th of last month. This has now been completed. The survey statistics are as follows: The total number of vehicles traveling through Laoximen each day averages 15,000, of which 3,600 are motor vehicles, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the total. The total number of vehicles traveling through Xiaodongmen each day averages 11,000, of which 2,100 are motor vehicles, accounting for approximately one-fifth of the total. The total number of vehicles traveling through the Binshan Road intersection each day averages 13,000, of which 2,000 are motor vehicles, accounting for approximately one-sixth of the total. Based on the above statistics, it is necessary to install traffic lights at these three locations. The Bureau's plan is to use three colors: red to indicate stop, yellow to indicate prepare, and green to indicate go. The installation location should not be too high, as the ones installed in the Special District are easily overlooked by drivers because they are too high. Also, the whistles used by traffic monitors in the Special District sound similar to those used by trams, which easily causes confusion. Therefore, the Bureau plans to use special whistles to distinguish them. It is reported that the Bureau is actively preparing for traffic lights and hopes to implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Songhu Branch Line Motor Vehicle to be Put into Service Soon</p>
<p>In order to facilitate passenger traffic on the Songhu Branch Line of the Jinghu Railway, steam motor vehicles are being used instead. Details of the situation have been reported in previous newspapers. The current state of the construction of the vehicle and the date of entry into service was inquired at the Wu Song Railway Factory and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Installation Status A total of five vehicles were purchased from the United Kingdom and shipped to China. After arriving at the factory, they were installed separately. Originally, each vehicle had one car with the engine installed at both ends, similar to a tram. However, it was later felt that there were too few seats, so it was changed to two cars per vehicle with the engine installed at the front of each car, so there is still no need to turn around.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Delay The vehicle project could have been completed earlier, but various materials needed internally were not available for a time, and the seat style was changed several times, so it was slightly delayed. In addition, the vehicle project was quite expensive, because the outside of the vehicle was not painted, but instead, lead was sprayed first and then steel was plated, so the color was white as silver and dazzling. The engine takes up one-quarter of the space, and the first-class and second-class seats are more comfortable than the old-fashioned cars.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Go into Service The exterior of each vehicle has now been completed, and the interior is being rushed day and night in order to complete it as soon as possible. All the parts in the car and the driving schedule, driving rules, etc., are clearly stated in the car, which is very detailed. It is said that there are currently the most of these vehicles in India. Now, the construction of one vehicle has been completely completed and is scheduled to be driven on the 12th of this month. The remaining four vehicles will be put into service one after another after the project is completed.</p>
<p>Arrangement of Stations In order to facilitate the operation of up and down trains after the vehicle goes into service, in addition to adding double tracks and building opposite platforms at the Tiantong'an, Zhanghuabang, and Yunzao stations, gatehouses will be added to the four important roads of Jungong Road, Yunzao Road, Tongji Road, and Taixing Road to prevent danger to pedestrians.</p>
<p>Huzhou Guild Hall Ordered to Rectify</p>
<p>Because the Board of Directors Has Not Been Re-Elected for Six Years</p>
<p>The Shanghai Huzhou Guild Hall has not yet registered in accordance with the regulations and has convened meetings and elected committee members without authorization. The Social Affairs Bureau has previously sent personnel to stop it and ordered the Guild Hall to register in accordance with the regulations within a specified period. Later, according to the application for registration by the directors of the Guild Hall, the Social Affairs Bureau reviewed and considered that, according to the regulations, the directors should be re-elected every year, and the current directors have not been re-elected for six years, which has legally lost its effect. The bureau immediately issued instructions, stating that after reviewing the articles of association, there were many inconsistencies with the current laws and regulations, and the term of office of the directors had long expired and had not been re-elected. The articles of association should be revised and the directors should be re-elected as soon as possible in order to promote the process, but according to the articles of association, the directors had lost their effectiveness and should no longer preside over guild hall affairs. The bureau deeply believes that the guild hall is a public undertaking of the people of Huzhou and should not be allowed to stagnate for a long time. It has now appointed Wang Yiting, Zhou Xiangling, Shen Lianfang, Yang Kuihou, Chen Aishi, Zhu Bangsheng, and Shen Tianhua, seven people from Shanghai, as members of the rectification committee of the guild hall to organize a rectification committee and designated Wang Yiting as the chairman of the committee to convene a meeting as soon as possible to revise the articles of association and submit them to the highest party headquarters in this city for permission to establish the guild hall. The bureau will approve and file it for record and then prepare for re-election in accordance with the new articles of association, which should be completed within three months. During the rectification period, the affairs of the guild hall will be the responsibility of the rectification committee, in addition to the distribution. At the same time, the mayor was reported, and it was heard that the bureau had received instructions to approve the filing for record, and had now sent another letter to Wang Yiting and other members of the rectification committee of the guild hall, asking them to convene a meeting as soon as possible to revise the articles of association and follow the procedures of the social organization to first apply for permission to establish a party and then report to the bureau for registration. The Huzhou Guild Hall, which had been lifeless for a long time, should have hope of improvement in the future.</p>

<p>Judge Wang Jianzu Exonerates Yin Keqin</p>
<p>Yin Was Accused of Suspicion of Theft</p>
<p>Sobbing Silently in Court</p>
<p>Declared Innocent After Repeated Study</p>
<p>Wang Jinsheng Sentenced to One Year in Prison</p>
<p>Wang Jinsheng, a Jiangbei native, was caught by the Hongkou Police Force on Broadway on January 29 with a pistol and eight bullets hidden on his person. Yin Keqin, a fellow villager of Wang, was arrested as a suspect of being an accomplice.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Subsequently, they were sent to the Provisional Court, accusing Wang and Yin of armed robbery of a resident on Yangshupu Road, number 1372, of property worth 150 yuan. They were interrogated and detained pending further investigation and review. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Jianzu proposed to continue the hearing. Wang Jinsheng confessed that the pistol and bullets were given to him by a friend to carry on his behalf, but strongly denied the robbery. When Yin Keqin was questioned, Yin lowered his head and remained silent, only sobbing frequently. Judge Wang found his situation pitiful and repeatedly asked him if he had committed the robbery, saying that he could state it directly. Yin then said that the statements he made at the police station were not of his own free will. Judge Wang then appointed lawyer Gao to defend the two defendants and then announced the verdict: the crime of robbery could not be established. However, Wang Jinsheng was found to have illegally possessed firearms and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and the firearms and ammunition were confiscated. Yin Keqin was found not guilty.</p>
<p>Prostitution House Water Heater Explosion Case Heard Yesterday</p>
<p>Awaiting Consultation with the Court for Review and Judgment</p>
<p>In the case of the explosion of a water heater in a prostitution house in Guian Lane on Glok Road in the French Concession on December 25 of last year, which killed a customer and a prostitute, causing a sensation at the time, the police force summoned Wu Mingchun, the owner of the prostitution house, and Zhu Shengji, who installed the water heater, to the French Court for questioning. The court ordered them to wait for further investigation and review. Yesterday, they were summoned again. First, Wu Mingchun, the defendant, hired lawyer Bahe as his representative, stating that the case had been thoroughly investigated by the employees of the Public Works Bureau and that his client was not involved in the case at all. He requested that the defendant Wu Mingchun and the employee Wang Guoyi be released, and that the right to private prosecution be reserved. Zhu Shengji was also defended by a lawyer, stating that when Zhu Shengji installed the water heater, he installed a venting mechanism. Later, Wu Mingchun, finding the sound of the venting to be loud, instructed him to remove it. In addition, there was a water meter on the water heater, and it was feared that it had been overheated, causing the disaster. This was entirely the fault of the other party and had nothing to do with his client. He requested a review. Then, the lawyers for both parties argued for a long time. The Chinese and Western officials ordered them to withdraw and wait for consultation with the court for review and judgment. Thief steals copper basin, basin copper broken, thief is exposed.</p>
<p>Pu Dong woman Yang Zhang, who lives at No. 72 Lotus Pond, South City, had a copper face basin stolen from her home at about 1 PM yesterday. After lunch, the parlor was unguarded. A thief from Yangzhou, Gao Changfu, took the opportunity to steal a copper face basin placed on the table and attempted to steal other items. Unexpectedly, he suddenly heard footsteps, and in a moment of panic, he ran out. The copper face basin he had stolen accidentally fell, causing a clanging sound outside. Ms. Yang heard the sound and went out to see what had happened. She saw a stranger picking up the copper face basin on the ground and running away. Realizing that she had been robbed, she immediately chased after him and shouted, "Catch the thief!" Fortunately, a patrolman from the No. 1 Precinct of the No. 1 District was returning from delivering official documents by bicycle when he heard the commotion. He rushed up and apprehended the thief, bringing him back to the police station to await preliminary interrogation and handling by the chief of the station.</p>
<p>Human Trafficking Case Found on Tongzhou Steamer</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent incidents of human traffickers luring women and children from good families and trafficking them for export. Yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, two female traffickers, Yao Wang and Chen Yuebao, lured two girls, Lu Jinyuan (16 years old) from Suzhou and Zhu Xingyuan (19 years old) from Changshu, onto the Taikoo Company's Tongzhou steamer in the French Concession, intending to take them to Tianjin to be sold into prostitution. As the steamer was about to set sail, investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang of the Women and Children Rescue Association boarded the steamer and arrested them together with the two girls, bringing them to the water patrol police station. After questioning, the female trafficker Yao Wang confessed that she was 42 years old, from Suzhou, and lived at No. 205 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road. Chen Yuebao confessed that she was 24 years old, from Huzhou, and lived at No. 16 Zhengping Lane, Songshan Road. They both claimed that Zhu Xingyuan was mortgaged by her father to Tianjin for 300 yuan to work as a prostitute for two years and a season, after which she could be redeemed. The police chief, after verifying the confessions, considered that the two women had lured innocent girls into prostitution, which was extremely illegal. He ordered Detective Cheng Yongnian to transfer them to the local court for disposal.</p>
<p>Public Wharf in Nanshi Being Planned The representatives of shipping companies, Xing Zhigang, and others, previously stated that all of the Pu shoreline in the South City was taken over by the Port Authority and leased to various shipping companies. They feared that if all the wharves were leased, there would be no public wharves left, and other ships would have difficulty docking. Therefore, they specially petitioned the Port Authority to first determine the location and width of each public wharf on the Nanshi shoreline to reassure shipowners and travelers. It has now been reported that the representatives have received a reply stating that the Bureau is currently planning all public wharves in Nanshi for the convenience of merchants and that there should be no problems with the existing wharves, so there is no need to worry. Forced Marriage of a Widow Thwarted</p>
<p>Huang Yingxi, a native of Suqian who was over thirty years old, was a soldier who came to Shanghai after being discharged from the army. He rented a place near the Lu Family Ancestral Hall in Yangjiazhai, Pudong, and worked as a laborer at a British-American tobacco factory. Huang died of illness in October of last year, leaving behind his wife, Ms. Ma, 31 years old, a native of Suzhou, and two sons: Chang Guiying, 8 years old, and Ci Gengying, 6 years old. Ms. Ma earns a living by picking out flowers at the Longmao Wharf. Huang's sister, Sun Huang, planned to remarry Ms. Ma to a certain Yu in that area for a bride price of 80 yuan. Ms. Ma was furious when she learned of this and vowed not to remarry. Sun Huang, seeing that her plan had failed, sent a letter to Huang Xiaoshi and Huang Huaizhi, nephews and other relatives of Huang Yingxi, ten days ago, asking them to come to Shanghai and force Ms. Ma to take her two children back to her hometown. Ms. Ma refused to comply because her hometown was poor and she would have no way to make a living, resulting in a major conflict and brawl. The patrol police arrived and took Huang Xiaoshi, Huang Huaizhi, Sun Huang, and Huang Ma to the Public Security Bureau's Third District for questioning.</p>
<p>Zhang Naiqiu Unwilling to Pay Alimony</p>
<p>Zhang Binghui, an old man from Ningbo who was the owner of the Qianmingjitang Pharmacy on Donggongguanma Road, Jingxin Bridge, French Concession, had a deceased wife of many years and married Shao as his second wife, who was thirty-nine years old. After Binghui died of illness last year, his son Naiqiu, now 19 years old, was responsible for managing the store. The stepmother Shao was unwilling to stay in the house and had an affair with Sun Xinyou, with whom she was cohabitating. Last September, Naiqiu reported the situation to the Dazimingzhong Police Station, and the parties signed a settlement on the spot after being brought to the police station. This year, Shao petitioned the French Court, accusing his son Naiqiu of failing to provide alimony. The court summoned the parties on February 21 and ordered the defendant to repay Zhang Shao 1,600 yuan and to pay 20 yuan in alimony each month. The defendant was dissatisfied with the judgment and requested a retrial.</p>
<p>Assassination Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Lu Gengsheng, a detective of the Huishan Police Force, Detective Shi Baoying, etc., arrested three Ningbo men, Chen A Gen, Zhang Decai, and Wu A Yu, in a small teahouse at No. 667 Dongyouheng Road on the morning of the day before yesterday. They found a pistol with seven live rounds on Chen. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Provisional Court, accused of plotting to assassinate Ningbo native He Rongtang (aka "Crutch Rongtang"). Judge Ge opened the court for interrogation. According to He Rongtang, "I used to live on Zhaofeng Road and was acquainted with Zhang Decai as a neighbor. I don't know Chen and Wu at all, and I have no grudges against them. Zhang Decai was charged with assaulting someone before, and I testified in court. Zhang was sentenced to imprisonment, perhaps he harbored a grudge against me for this and wanted to harm me." When questioned, Chen A Gen confessed that a friend surnamed Xu told him that Zhang Decai wanted to harm Crutch Rongtang and asked him to borrow a gun, agreeing to hand it over at the teahouse. Yesterday morning, I arrived at the teahouse first. Soon, Xu arrived and stuffed the pistol into my pocket, telling me to hand it over when Zhang Decai arrived. Xu left immediately. In an instant, the detectives suddenly arrived and arrested me. Zhang Decai confessed that Chen A Gen's confession was all untrue and that he did not know him. Yesterday, he was drinking tea at the teahouse with a friend surnamed Zhou and was also arrested. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Wu A Gen confessed that he was arrested by mistake. Judge Ge ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<p>Chen Zixun Imprisoned and Ill</p>
<p>Family Requests Bail Denied</p>
<p>Doctor Certifies No Danger</p>
<p>Chen Zixun, a native of Guangdong who worked at the American Express Bank, embezzled more than 120,000 yuan and was sued by the bank in the Provisional Court. He was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and sent to prison. After only a few months, Chen became ill in prison due to his weak body. The Western prison official transferred him to the Public Works Bureau Hospital for treatment. Chen's wife, Chen Lianzhen, who did not live in Shanghai, came to Shanghai after hearing the news and petitioned the Provisional Court to grant bail, considering that her husband's illness was hematochezia, which posed a life-threatening risk, in order to receive treatment. After receiving the petition, the court considered that it was necessary to inquire with the doctor about whether the prisoner's illness was dangerous and summoned Dr. Smith, a Western doctor who treated Chen, to the First Court yesterday morning. The Western doctor testified that he was a doctor at the Public Works Bureau Hospital and treated Chen's illness. His initial condition was quite severe, but after treatment, he had improved slightly. Further treatment in a few days would be even more effective. It would take three to four months to return to his original state of health, but the dangerous period had passed and there was no risk to his life. He was very comfortable in the hospital. Judge Gao then said to Chen's wife, "The purpose of your request is to have your husband released on bail for treatment. According to the doctor, there does not seem to be any danger, and it is even more beneficial to receive treatment in the hospital. Why do you need to go through this procedure?" The court specifically ruled that the request for bail was denied. Chen Lianzhen continued, "Since my husband's illness is hematochezia, his blood is already poor. If he develops other illnesses, his weak body will not be able to resist. Can you please order the doctor to administer blood-tonifying medication so that he can recover as soon as possible? And can I be allowed to visit him in prison at this time, as I am about to leave Shanghai and return home?" Judge Gao said that the prison regulations stipulate how family members may visit prisoners and instructed Lu Lian</p>

<h3>Resolution Methods for Disputes at the Xiangchang Factory</h3>
<p>City Civil Training Committee Settles Three Items</p>
<p>Guomin News reported that the Xiangchang Cloth Factory had implemented a factory shutdown at the end of the lunar year of Jialu last year due to poor business. Although the Social Affairs Bureau repeatedly mediated and the Municipal Government convened arbitration to resolve the dispute, the labor side still considered the results unsatisfactory. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, all the male and female workers of the factory crowded into the factory. Unexpectedly, the factory immediately summoned patrol officers from the French Concession police to suppress them, leading to great disorder. Because the police officers saw the surging crowd and the crowd was directing blame at the police officers, the order became chaotic, fearing other incidents. Therefore, shots were fired into the sky, but unexpectedly, a worker was accidentally injured. One male worker has died, and several police officers have also been injured, and three firearms have been damaged. It is now heard that the Municipal Party Department is taking the case very seriously and has decided to handle it strictly in order to thoroughly resolve it. The resolutions of the City Civil Training Committee on the handling of the case are recorded as follows: (1) Because the factory is losing money, the Arbitration Committee has approved the shutdown of the factory, and the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union is ordered to consult with the labor side and send representatives to request further travel subsidies from the capital side to show consideration. (2) The workers of the factory were injured or killed due to misunderstandings during the request, and the association, together with the Social Affairs Bureau, should send personnel to negotiate with the factory to provide compensation for the injuries and deaths, and provide medical and injury expenses for the injured. (3) A letter should also be sent to the Municipal Government to seriously negotiate with the police.</p>
<h3>Various Labor Unions Submit Petitions to Revoke the Standards for Handling Labor-Capital Disputes</h3>
<p>The Huayang Printing Labor Union and others submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating that the standards for handling labor-capital disputes are clearly articles that oppress labor, and earnestly request the withdrawal of the order to appease the public. It was discovered that on the 7th of last month, a report stated that the 13 standards for handling labor-capital disputes drafted by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau had been approved by your office and forwarded to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for instructions on amendments for record, and attached the full text of the 13 articles. The affiliated associations, etc., carefully discussed the articles and were deeply worried. After careful research of these standards from the first to the third article, which states "shall not request subsidies and supplies from the capital side as public places," it is its intention to make the unions that are organizing and developing lose their financial support and unable to survive economically, and thus quickly perish. And the established unions that have obtained this benefit from the capital side can use this as an excuse to cancel it. Its tone is no different from representing capitalists to make it impossible for the unions to operate. The fourth item stipulates that unions are only allowed to represent all members, not all workers, which is clearly intended to create room for a part of the so-called non-member workers to hinder the unions, which is very obvious. And the fifth article stipulates that the contract should not stipulate that non-members are not allowed to be hired, and similar articles. And the sixth article, the contract should not stipulate that only union members must obtain union consent, and similar articles. The seventh article, the contract should not stipulate that if the union expels workers from membership, the capital side must also dismiss them from their jobs, and similar articles, etc., are clearly giving the biased party the ability to arbitrarily dismiss the responsible personnel in the union on the one hand, and on the other hand, they can arbitrarily use spies and stooges to disperse the power of the union, eliminate the function of the union, and undermine the discipline of the union. In short, it is actually intended to make the union ineffective and unable to survive, which is fundamentally contrary to the party's program of protecting labor groups and assisting their development. If this is done, it would be better to simply close all unions with one order, which would be more straightforward. Why use the roundaboutness of the standards for handling labor-capital disputes to make the union groan and die without actually dying? It truly makes the future of the labor movement bleak and painful. Moreover, the eighth article of the standard stipulates that the contract should not stipulate a regular method for generally increasing wages. The principle of union organization is mostly to protect workers with low wages so that they can stabilize their livelihood, and a general increase is particularly fair. If the contract does not stipulate that the capital side can arbitrarily give or take away, then those with low monthly salaries will never have the hope of a raise, and in the future, workers will have no room to demand to improve their lives. Article 11 stipulates that the issue of profit sharing in the contract should be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations. If there are no laws and regulations to follow, it should be handled in accordance with the customs of each industry. The surplus created by labor must still be arbitrarily controlled by the capital side, and it is not known where to place the labor's pursuit of liberation. Article 12 stipulates that working hours should be handled according to the customs of each industry, then the customs are twelve hours, or even fifteen or sixteen hours. This life, which is not as good as cattle and horses, will also be allowed to follow the natural course of custom without improvement, directly regarding revolution as troublesome or even inhuman. Article 13 stipulates that wage increases should be based on the price index and the capital side's operating conditions in the most recent three years. The capital side can use excuses to refuse everywhere, directly combining with the article that does not allow general increases to form a triple constraint. The affiliated associations, etc., carefully examined each article and found that they are completely one-sided and unfair standards, giving the capital side supreme benefits. Considering the handling principles, how can it be called balanced? It was investigated that in the 13th year, when the President was serving as the Grand Marshal in Guangzhou, the union regulations he promulgated stipulated that administrative agencies should only be responsible for investigation and arbitration in the event of conflicts between employers or workers in non-public utilities, and should not enforce compulsory judgments. Today, the labor-capital handling standards set by the Social Affairs Bureau use the words "not allowed" everywhere to forcibly decide and make the contract between labor and capital unequal, which not only easily breeds sour disputes but also greatly destroys the labor movement, which is completely contrary to the principle of the people's movement determined by the Third National Congress that the national farmers and workers have already obtained considerable organization, and in the future, the party must assist them. Especially state my humble opinion, sincerely request that you review and approve the withdrawal of the order, the labor movement is fortunate, the party and the country are fortunate. Presented respectfully by the Huayang Printing Union and 186 other labor unions.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Trade Association Discusses Matters to be Handled by the Employment Meeting</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Pharmaceutical Trade Association convened a temporary emergency meeting the other day to discuss the issue of unemployed workers that the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union should handle the employment of. More than 50 committee members and colleagues attended the meeting, and Zhang Meian was publicly elected as chairman. The letter from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union was read out, setting a deadline of three days for a concrete response on the unemployment issue, otherwise mandatory employment would be implemented. After discussion, everyone agreed that the association had already received separate instructions from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau regarding the pharmaceutical industry's unemployment issue, stating that if employers added employees, they must give priority to hiring the unemployed workers, and the unemployed workers' issue had been resolved on record. This time, the union's mandatory employment was illegal, and the colleagues should abide by the instructions and refuse to accept mandatory employment. The following response measures were decided: (1) Representatives will be publicly elected immediately and a document will be prepared to report everything to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the union's actions be corrected in accordance with the previous instructions and that the capital side be effectively protected. (2) The Public Security Bureau is requested to send police to be stationed permanently at pharmacies in the Chinese Concession to prepare for emergencies. (3) The pharmacies in the Concession will jointly send a letter to request that the police department be responsible for protection. (4) The propaganda that the association and the Municipal Government have approved to force employment in the printing industry by the labor union will be printed, the same industry unanimously decides, to refuse to obey the slogan. (5) The meeting will be held once a day in the near future to facilitate joint discussion of response measures. (6) If the situation is tense and changes occur, the colleagues will use all their strength to take passive countermeasures. (7) More than a dozen special officers were temporarily elected to take charge of preparatory work. The meeting adjourned at 7 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Koreans An Chang-ho and Wu Mai Hold Farewell Banquet</h3>
<p>Wu Mai took the Dalian Maru on the 8th, passing through Yingkou from Shanghai to Liaoning for propaganda. An Chang-ho, the leader of the Korean Independence Party, and others, specially held a farewell banquet for Wu and his secretary Li Fengchu at the Jinling Restaurant on the evening of the 7th. After taking their seats, An delivered a speech, saying that Mr. Wu has always been committed to the anti-imperialist movement, and I admire him very much. China and Korea have close relations. If Korea is independent, then the Japanese imperialists will never dare to invade the Northeast. I hope that Mr. Wu will pay attention to the relationship between China and Korea in the future. I believe that Mr. Wu's trip to the Northeast will definitely achieve the greatest effect. I wish you success. Wu replied, briefly saying that your two countries are as closely related as lips and teeth, and I deeply believe that a simple revolution in China is not easy to take effect. It is necessary to unite all small and weak nations and fight together to succeed. The President's instructions to our party comrades are very clear in their meaning. Therefore, in the shortest period of time, we must unite the oppressed nations and attack the imperialists together in order to be liberated, etc. Then Mr. Li also gave a speech, and the banquet ended in joy.</p>
<h3>Silk and Cocoon Groups Discuss Relief Methods</h3>
<p>Spring Banquet to Be Held Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Association of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk and Cocoon General Association has recently seen sluggishness in the foreign silk market since last winter. In addition, each time the silk factories deliver silk to various foreign firms, the silk packages are often stolen by bandits en route, and there are various losses such as weighing losses. Manufacturers have long wanted to convene various industry associations to discuss relief methods, but there is a risk of absenteeism at each meeting. It is now specially scheduled to hold a spring banquet at the Yizhixiang Western Wheat Restaurant at 12:00 noon on the 9th (today). All Shanghai factory owners and regular managers are invited to a joint meeting to discuss remedies. The association has sent separate notices to all silk factories in the city for reference.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Promotes Long-Distance Telephone</h3>

<h3>Anecdotes of Dr. Ma Junwu, Professor at Daxia University</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>Former Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minister of Education, Minister of Justice, President of the National Industrial University of Beiping, and President of Daxia University of Shanghai. Currently a professor at Daxia, Dr. Ma Junwu, a native of Guilin, Guangxi, is a renowned figure in academic circles and a well-known person. Daxia University's achievements are largely due to Dr. Ma's great contributions.</p>
<p>When Dr. Ma studied in Japan, he lived a life of hardship and simplicity, eating from simple bamboo containers and drinking water from gourds, but he studied diligently without stopping. He became ill with lung disease and nearsightedness, suffering from various ailments. Later, he went to Germany to study and paid attention to hygiene, and finally regained his health. Dr. Ma's knowledge is extensive, all obtained through hard work and diligent study. Ma was the first Chinese person to obtain a doctorate degree from Germany.</p>
<p>Before Dr. Ma served as Minister of Justice in Beiping, his mother said to him, "Serving as Minister of Justice, I fear there will be many cases of injustice. Creating evil karma is worrying." Therefore, after only ten days, Dr. Ma abruptly resigned. Those who heard about it were surprised. They did not know that it was all because of his old mother's words.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma is now teaching two courses at Daxia: "Several Important Issues in Economic Policy" and "Academic Studies and Thought." He lectures on time, guiding students patiently and earnestly. He has never missed a class. The audience is full, which shows his students' faith in him.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma is skilled in calligraphy. His script is unique and original. After class, he often wields his brush and ink for students. Those who receive his work treasure it. Dr. Ma calls it "extracurricular activities."</p>
<p>Dr. Ma's name is said to be cleverly matched with the English name "Darwin"!! (transliteration). The character "Da" can be interpreted as lamb. It is also said to be interesting.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma lives in seclusion in Yanghang Township, Baoshan. He owns seventy-six mu of good farmland. In addition to teaching, he cultivates the land, happily enjoying himself. He has the air of not knowing there was a Han dynasty, let alone the Wei and Jin dynasties. In the summer of the year before last, Vice President Ou visited him on official business and personally saw Dr. Ma wearing a bamboo hat and barefoot, holding a hoe and cultivating. Dr. Ma is indifferent to fame and fortune, devoted to practical learning, and detached from the mundane world, wandering outside of material things. Although he held important positions in the country before, he remained incorruptible and had no savings. He wears simple clothes and eats simple food, no different from his situation in the past. It is said that last spring, his eldest son went to the United States to study, and all the expenses were borrowed from others, and he even pawned clothes to raise money. His integrity can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>From Theme Songs to the Glamorous History of the Revolving Palace</h3>
<p>— Liu Shuofu</p>
<p>I remember that recent movies with slightly better plots all have a theme song. Such as "Ramona," "Angel," etc., were popular for a while. Almost everyone could sing them. How many new movies are released in a year, and how many new songs are added. Of course, not all of these songs are good, but there are indeed many that are very beautiful. The ones I like are "Red Skin," "Paradise," "Sally of My Dreams," "Roman Holiday," etc. Although they are small structure songs, they are very catchy. I think perhaps most people believe that movies must be accompanied by beautiful music. Old sheet music is well known, but to use it to match new movies, firstly, the times don't match, and secondly, the plot doesn't match. People who watch and listen will inevitably feel a bit stale. Therefore, the popularity of theme songs is also a proof that movies and music cannot be separated. As for sound movies, some people originally didn't approve of them. He said that movies originally had a humorous interest. Once everyone speaks, wouldn't it lose the true fun of movies? But my opinion is that sound movies also have their advantages. Because the current sound movies are generally classified into one category, which is purely song and dance, such as "The Broadway Melody," "The Great Revue," "The Hollywood Revue of 1929," etc., which adds dancing to newly composed songs and also adds a little plot. Watching those singing and dancing scenes is like being on a Broadway stage. Another category has a very good script, and the material also has a place where music and singing can be added. Therefore, a theme song is specially compiled, such as the songs "Little Son" in "Cryable and Singable", the "Loving Mother Song" in "Filial Son of the Stage", and "Sally of My Dreams" in "Red Bean Lovesickness," etc. The drama is named after the song, and the song is spread by the drama. Another category is about murder and crime cases, using sound to express the horror of the crime and the linguistic form of the investigation, such as "Water Will Always Find Its Level" and "The Secret of the Slipper." Another category is when the situation in the plot is sung, such as "Lila and Lelita" and "Beautiful Leg Dance". These are all of this type. Although they are movies, they do not escape the original meaning of opera. Various sound movies, this category is the most authentic. The most recent movie I saw, "The Love Parade," is also of this type. But the plot, performance, and sound can give the audience twelve points of satisfaction. The general idea of the play is that a count named Earl is sent by a queen in a country of South America to France. Later, the count made a lot of romantic affairs because he liked to flirt with women, which delayed official business and was withdrawn. The queen was in the midst of love, so she also fell in love with this romantic Earl and married him. But although they married for love, they could not avoid the status of monarch and subject. The Earl was very dissatisfied with this unnatural form, so he used various romantic means to subdue this respected and powerful queen. Finally, the couple reconciled and jointly ruled the country. The actress who plays the queen is named Jeanette MacDonald. She was originally a stage actress. Her voice is high and clear, and her performance is delicate and appropriate, which can be considered unique. In particular, she plays the queen's attitude with solemnity and composure, which is rare. The Earl is played by the famous Maurice Chevalier. His expression is lively and suave, and his singing voice is round and pleasant. He is truly worthy of being called the "international puppet" by everyone.</p>
<p>The play has the following songs: "Paris, Stay the Same," "Let's Be Common People," "Whispering Song," "Unused," "Lover in Dream," "Entertainment of the Queen," "Marching Song." The tone is very harmonious and pleasant. Finally, the last sentence is that this play is directed by Ernst Lubitsch. All the films directed by this man are without any warning, from beginning to end there is no slack.</p>
<p>The plot is good, the actors are good, the songs are good, what else</p>
<p>to say?</p>
<h3>Talkativeness of Americans</h3>
<p>— Guoxin</p>
<p>Ranks First in the World</p>
<p>A communication from Poetry Valley states that according to the speech given by Mr. Smith in the Wireless Telephone Improvement Association, Americans are the most fond of talking in the world. Smith has created a comparative table of the number of times telephones are used each year in various countries. According to the table, the most talkative country is the United States. Even if the number of telephone calls used by all countries with telephones is added together, it is less than half of the number of telephone calls in the United States. This shows how talkative Americans are. According to Smith's table, the number of telephone calls commonly used by Americans all year round is 225 million times. (225,000,000,000 times)</p>
<h3>Take It With a Smile</h3>

<p>Maid — Madam, there is only one way. Increase my wages next month, and then it won't offset.</p>
<p>Father — Why did you come back so late today? Son — The teacher kept me at school and wouldn't let me come back. Father — What for? Son — It was all a misunderstanding. Father — What kind of misunderstanding? I can explain to the teacher. Son — In geography class, I mistook the Atlantic Ocean for the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market After the Period of Financial Volatility</h3>
<p>Retreating into a Level Path</p>
<p>Hesitant and Unsure, Speculators in the Trade Vary. Yesterday, the gold market on the 8th was relatively stable, showing resilience amidst weakness, with fluctuations of only four taels. Hovering around the 500 tael mark, the sentiment among traders seemed uncertain. In the market, actual buying was strong, with companies like Heng Yu, Sheng Da, Yuansheng, and Hongli all making progress. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yong Shengchang, and Shunli, among others, had already sold off. As for foreign exchange, it appeared slightly stable and firm, though the listed rates had been extended by one increment. The morning market saw an initial rise in large bars, followed by a slight decline. Later, buying exceeded selling, and drafts were particularly favored, briefly surpassing the 500 tael mark. However, selling activity pushed the price back down, breaking through 500 taels again and showing a weak trend. Ultimately, the price managed to hold around the 500 tael level. Observing the situation, the future still seems to involve some degree of maneuvering. The afternoon market was closed due to Saturday's routine, and recent London silver bars rose by 5/16, with long-term bars rising by 1/4. The price of silver also increased by 5/8, and exchange rates remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Lingering Around the 500 Tael Mark. The April gold fixing opened low at 498 taels, down 9 mace. Gross prices fluctuated by more than one tael as traders entered and exited, circling around the 98 tael level. Drafts saw minimal fluctuations. April-May British gold at banks traded at 11 3125 pence. Huabi sold recent US dollars at $47.1875. When the prime rate was announced, it had increased by .25, US dollars by 5 jiao, and Japanese gold was listed down by a small fraction. Consequently, the price dropped from 99 taels to 98 taels and 23 qian. However, internal conditions remained uncertain. Shanghai absorbed June British gold at 11 375 pence, and released May at 11 3125 pence, which immediately rose to 99 taels and qian. Soon after, sellers slightly increased, and Japanese gold for forward settlement could reach 1 tael and 04125 fen, returning to 98 taels and 5 qian. Around 10 o'clock, the wind suddenly shifted, and companies like Yu Da and Hongli were eager to buy. Drafts also tended to be firm, and banks traded June British gold at 11 25 pence and April gold was taken in by Zhengjin at 11 25 pence.</p>
<p>Suddenly Escaping the 500 Tael Mark, Eventually Reaching 501 Taels and 6 Qian.</p>
<p>After a while, it fell by about two taels, and at 10:30 it was 500 taels and 005 qian.</p>
<p>Yu Da and others sold off again, but buyers on the trading floor were relentless, and arbitrageurs suddenly entered the market. At one point, the price jumped to 501 taels and 9 qian. At this point, Wan Yu, Shunli, and speculators took advantage of this peak to sell, and the market sentiment suddenly reversed sharply, plunging more than two taels. At 11:45, it was only 499 taels and 34 qian. In an instant, it rose more than one tael again, to 500 taels and 0056 qian, while recent British gold settled at 11 125 pence, forward at 25, recent Japanese gold at 1 tael 0475 fen, and forward was suppressed by a small .375, but transactions were not heavy. By the noon closing, it was calculated to be 5 taels, an increase of 1 tael and 1 qian compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The final settled price was suppressed by a small two or three taels. The highest price in the morning was 501 taels and 9 qian, and the lowest price was 498 taels, a difference of 3 taels and 9 qian. The announced price was changed to 522 taels and 6 qian due to Japanese gold being listed down by a small fraction, initially suppressed by a small 24 taels, then only suppressed by about 21 taels, and finally calculated to be suppressed by a small 22 or 23 taels. The ledger records 499 taels for this month, 500 taels for next month, and a make-up of 499 taels. Goods opened at 497 taels and 8 qian in the morning and closed at 99 taels and 7 qian at noon. In inter-dealer trading, Heng Yu and Sheng Da bought several thousand bars, while Hongli, Yuansheng, Kunhe, and Wan Yu, in addition to Da, all made purchases. Yuanheng, Fuchang, Shunli, Yong Chengchang, Yiyu, Fuyu, and Cheng Fengyong all sold. Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Tai, Yuan Yu Yong, and Yichang occasionally bought and sold. Small retail investors made slight purchases. Dalian bought 1,000 bars and sold 1,200 to 1,300 bars. Hedging bars were initially sold and then bought.</p>

At noon closing, compared to the previous day, shillings decreased by .0625, US dollars decreased by .125, and Japanese gold increased by .125, presenting a scene of apparent looseness but actual stability. Chinese merchants and speculators made minor transactions. Sheng Da and others pursued 50,000 to 60,000 pounds, while banks like Mitsui, Shanghai, and Cheng Fengyong Gold Shop sold some. There were also occasional sales of 40,000 to 50,000 pounds, while Sumitomo, Shanghai, and Zhengjin, among others, took in. Banks traded 50,000 to 60,000 pounds among themselves. US dollars also saw transactions of about 200,000 yuan, with Huabi entering and exiting, and Dongya selling slightly. Transactions in Japanese exchange were rare and small, with only Mitsui having transactions of several hundred thousand yuan. The market sentiment was relatively stable.</p>

<p>Customs Duty Soars by Three Yuan</p>
<p>Other Increases Also Significant... Transactions Total 9.6 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market in this port generally remained flat in the morning, but the situation became tense again in the afternoon. Selling activity became more heated again, while the spot market remained relatively quiet. The extent of the bond price increase was alarming. Due to the optimistic political situation, investors were very interested in buying, and buyers consistently held a dominant position in the market. This was especially evident yesterday. The market was initially stable when it opened in the morning, but the upward trend was strong in the second session. In the afternoon, the buying force from all sides increased, and prices became even more bullish. Next month's futures for domestic customs duties nearly rose by four yuan, hitting the limit price and halting trading. As a result, customs duties rose by approximately three yuan compared to the previous day, while others also rose by one or two yuan. Only the 96 Series was up by a good four jiao. The direction of the bond market is still difficult to grasp.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Presents a Clear and Bright Picture</p>
<p>The rising trend in the yarn market is strong due to optimistic news about the political situation. There are almost no new sellers entering the market, and most profitable sellers are taking the opportunity to short. At the same time, real sales to customers are expanding, and transactions in 10-count coarse yarn are particularly brisk. The yarn market currently has a stable outlook, but overseas cotton yarn is still trending downwards.</p>
<p>Human Bidding Sees Active Buying. The human bidding market opened with a slight softening of sentiment due to the further decline in American cotton. Retail investors sold, and prices for each month fell by four or five qian. In the second and third sessions, due to the favorable political situation, major players took the opportunity to cover their short positions in large amounts. Prices for each month rose steadily, and as a result, each month rose by 1, 2, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that sales of Yunnan-made coarse yarn were brisk, and buying interest increased further, making the market even tighter. Each month rose by 9 qian to 1 tael and 12 qian. It was found that there were more buyers in the market, and the total turnover for the day was 21,000 bales. The closing prices are recorded below: Human Bidding, gains, losses, and remaining balance</p>

<p>May 1140 10 31,400 August 1141 1 8,450</p>
<p>Existing Yarn Sells Quickly. Existing yarn is selling very well. The Yunnan group is showing great interest and high prices. It was found that the total purchases by various groups for the day totaled 3,235 bales. 1,100 bales were traded among colleagues. Prices rose by 5 qian to 7 qian and 5 fen. Among the customer groups, the Yunnan group was the most active buyer, purchasing 900 bales. In addition, Qingdao purchased 450 bales, Guangdong 215 bales, Sichuan 550 bales, Niuzhuang 30 bales, Hankou 60 bales, Shantou 120 bales, Xiamen 40 bales, Jiangxi 100 bales, Inland 460 bales, Tianjin 105 bales, Anqing 70 bales, Gaoyang 50 bales, Bang 100 bales, and Factories opened 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>The Cotton Market: Weak at First, Strong at Last</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton trended downwards, reaching 1 jiao and 5 fen. Chen Line also broke through. The trend in this port was stable and not affected. Due to the lack of bottom goods, the source of each road is not prosperous, and the Mo group is always long, pulling strongly and not letting go, so the market did not fall. Spot cotton sales are quiet, and most factories are purchasing Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Mo Bidding Continues to Rise. The futures cotton market opened with a slight fatigue as American cotton fell again and retail investors sold. Prices for each month fell by one or two qian. In the afternoon, as the yarn market rose, short covering surged, and prices for each month rose by another two qian. Total turnover for the day was 27,600 dan. The closing prices for Han Biao are recorded below. Han Biao Closing Price Gain/Loss Remaining Balance</p>

<p>American Cotton Plunges by More Than 30 Pounds</p>
<p>Recent Months Are Near the 1 Jiao 4 Fen Mark</p>

Futures fell by 33 to 38 pounds, and spot fell by 35 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 9 points, and spot rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 10 points. Indian cotton was strong due to purchases by Japanese merchants. Ping Guoer and Aomu La rose by 2 rupees for both near and far terms, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 1 rupee for both near and far terms.

<p>Reasons for the Sharp Drop in American Cotton Prices</p>
<p>No Substantial Development in Reducing New Cotton Fields</p>
<p>Estimated Decrease in World American Cotton Consumption</p>
<p>Fewer Exports and Weak Demand; Cloth Heads Remain Stagnant</p>
<p>Assistance from the Agricultural Bureau Still Pending</p>
<p>Manufacturers Short Selling and Bulls Disappointed in Profit Taking</p>
<p>But the Actual Position of Futures Has Improved</p>
<p>A New York telegram reported on the cotton market situation for the week of the 7th, saying that there were doubts about whether there would be a sufficient reduction in new cotton fields. In addition, there was an estimated smaller trend in world consumption of American cotton. It was said that the Agricultural Bureau must wait until the cotton field problem is resolved before providing active assistance. These factors have gradually been believed, and the selling trend has greatly intensified. This week, the price of May futures even fell below 1 jiao and 4.5 fen per pound. Another reason for the selling trend is the general lack of confidence in prices. When cotton prices fall, colleagues and shorts absorb the sales, but demand disappears when prices rise. The Agricultural Bureau's policy on the cotton market has not been changed, and there has been no substantial development in the cotton field situation. However, some areas have good cotton fields, and planting preparations are not much different from normal. The actual position of futures has now greatly improved.</p>
<p>Kong, many parties have not settled, the period is the cotton goods and cotton that it owns, and exports are not many. The actual material is reduced, the domestic cloth is turning to trade, spot cotton demand is not cold, and the government's intentions are still undetermined.

<p>Grain: River Rice Market Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, goods from various groups arrived in Zhabei one after another. River stocks totaled more than 300 numbers. Sales in this street were very high. However, due to news of transport bans from inland producing areas, and the city prices in this port, both markets had undergone revisions before the rainy weather. This was due to high production prices, increased costs, and then a unified selling strategy. Only when the increase is not achieved will it be released. Therefore, each store, such as those with insufficient inventory who urgently need to add goods, must release the goods. Therefore, northern japonica rice saw a price increase of two jiao in the morning, with the bottom of half a cargo ship increasing by about one jiao, and thin rice followed the japonica rice. However, sales were limited. Yang Du Bu Xian rice turned to a stable situation, with major boards continuing to add half a yuan. White yuan was stable, although a few sellers called for higher prices, but buyers were unwilling to increase prices, and transactions were sluggish.</p>
<p>Coming from the River in South Shanghai Ships were taken, and sales were flat. Changxi Northern Japonica's buying interest was not strong and had no style in the northern market, and the market was slightly better near Jiao. Su Tong White Japonica was still stable, with no good taste in the countryside, and the price rise was only a sign. The Southern Helper's thin early rice in the river and storage was turning scarce, and the number of incoming goods was not large, and the market was up and up. Yangxian tended to be stable, but Duxian, because there was a tight step for customers to purchase, and the circulation changed and the yin turned and now felt alive, diaofang and customers were moving, although the number was not large, but the market was good.</p>
<p>Distant Month Flour Tends to Flow Downstream</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, the prices for all months in the morning and afternoon showed a trend of near stability and distant fatigue. The current month was stable because actual sales were still active, and therefore people's minds were quite stable. Distant terms, however, were priced against foreign wheat, and they were seen to be about two jiao smaller. Additionally, a large number of non-industry speculators were afraid of the crazy fall of the previous month, a difference of more than one qian from the period. At this time, if they relied again on the poor wheat harvest and tried their best to buy and raise prices, then an unexpected storm might occur. Therefore, although the overall situation was bullish, those who actually took action were very lonely, and therefore the market showed a downward trend. The new flour from June onwards softened the mood due to better weather. As a result, this month's price was unchanged, April's price was lower by 5 li, May's price was lower by 1 fen and 2.5 li, July's price was lower by 7.5 li, July's price was lower by 7.5 li, and August's price was lower by 1 fen.</p>
<p>The Soft State of the Wheat Market Created by the Environment</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat market, the prices for all months in the morning and afternoon were slightly influenced by small foreign wheat and quotations. Furthermore, the needs in March and April, apart from factories, meant that traders and customers did not dare to hoard as they continued to arrive at ports along the Yangtze River and north of the Yangtze River, although not vigorously. Therefore, if the factory didn't move, the exchange market would be unstable. This was also a de facto necessity. As a result, the price for this month was lower by 3 fen, the price for April was lower by 2 fen, the price for June was lower by 3 fen, and the prices for July and August were lower by 4 fen each. In the spot market, factories' offices were watching a lot, and merchants' goods were not close in changing intentions. There were no transactions yesterday, only some secondary goods were traded, but the market value had invisibly gone down by two or three fen. Kaisha City Wheat was 5 taels and 01 fen, Anqing Wheat was 5 taels and 1 qian, and Zhenjiang Wheat was 5 taels and 07 fen, totaling 1,000 bales, which were handled by Fufeng.</p>
<p>Dried Fruits: Pao Round Longan from Quanzhou Shipped Out Yesterday</p>
<p>Quanzhou's Da Pao Longan, after being opened in the middle of last month, has not continued to arrive to date. The bottom stocks in each bank on the market are mostly out of stock except for two or three homes with more hand-goods. However, those who have goods still have low-priced goods that have advanced, and the selling price has not been increased. However, the number board has been raised, causing the land price to rise by 5 or 6 yuan, exceeding that of the Shanghai market. The situation of upside-down has already formed. According to the telegram yesterday, the land head</p>
<h3>Dormitory No. 3 SH</h3>
<p>Miss Li faced the inverted mirror on the wall, energetically applying snow-white fragrant powder to her face with a powder puff. The powder clung to the snow cream she had just applied.</p>
<p>At the intersection of her nose and cheeks, there was often an excess of oily sebum, so the powder was applied especially thickly.  How annoying, they still haven't turned on the lights at this hour. The light bulb remained calmly hidden in the darkness. She moved her face closer to the mirror, the tip of her nose outside the mirror connecting with the tip of her nose inside. She carefully adjusted her face again with both hands and frantically rummaged on the table. "Where's the lipstick?"</p>
<p>Miss Huang, wearing a tight-fitting cotton jacket, was bending over, rummaging through her suitcase. "It's on the table, why don't you look for yourself. I don't know why, but I can't find a white silk scarf. I remember putting it in this suitcase. Did I take it out sometime? How annoying. And the lights aren't on. What are those rice buckets in the office doing? Don't they know it's dark?"</p>
<p>"No, where's the lipstick on the table?" Miss Li was getting frantic. Just then, the light suddenly turned on. Miss Li picked up a soggy rag from the corner of the table, and the lipstick fell out of it at the same time. "Oh, here it is." Only now do they turn on the lights. The rice buckets must have woken up from their nap.</p>
<p>Miss Huang glanced at the light, pulled open a suitcase, and untied the straps.</p>
<p>"Miss Li, there's a guest outside." The doorman came in with a meaningful smile, handing over a warmed-up business card, placing it on the table. His eyes, under a casually tilted peaked cap, stole a glance at Miss Li's newly reddened lips, then slid over to Miss Huang's white waistband, barely concealed by her short jacket. Then he stepped out. "Who is it?" Miss Huang, holding a cheongsam, turned her body to look at the name on the card. "Ah, what a coincidence, it's him! Huang, if he had come half an hour later, we would have both missed him." Miss Li tightly grasped the card and showed it to Miss Huang. The corners of her slightly small mouth were far apart, and her two bright gold teeth shone in the electric light.</p>
<p>"That's great," Miss Huang said coldly, still looking for the scarf.</p>
<p>"What do we do? My hands aren't washed, and I'm not dressed. Tell him to wait a while." She hurriedly put down the card and plunged her hands into the basin, full of powder and soap, quickly washing them. Water spilled out of the basin, wetting the cover of a novel.</p>
<p>"Huang, hurry up, what are you still looking for?" "You have a guest, why do you want me to hurry? It's infuriating. Ah, after searching for so long, it was in the corner of this suitcase." Miss Huang smiled falsely as she pulled out a scarf.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to accompany me to see him? Now that he's come first, isn't it the same if we go together? Hurry, hurry."</p>
<p>Miss Li threw a wrung-out washcloth on the table and busied herself buttoning the cheongsam, the buttons sparkling more brightly than her gold teeth. She then put on a cape, the white fur collar tightly wrapped around her fleshy, powdery skull. "The dress is on, Huang." Miss Li leaned against the table, helplessly watching Miss Huang put on her shimmering brocade fur coat and wrap the scarf around herself.</p>
<p>"I don't have a coat. It's really not good to go out. No matter what, I have to find a way to make one. Look, Li, this just doesn't look right." Miss Huang looked at her own clothes and then heavily glanced at Miss Li's white fur collar.</p>
<p>"Don't hesitate, let's go. I've been telling you to get one made. You thought the one we saw on Avenue Joffre yesterday was too expensive." "That's because I..." The two walked out the door, and the entire dormitory fell silent. Only the sound of turning pages could be heard. On the bed in the right corner by the window, someone was silently lost in thought.</p>
<h3>English Lady Rowland Wins Poetry Prize</h3>
<p>Chang Xi</p>
<p>Recently, the Hymn Society, presided over by Ms. Carolin B. Parkei of New York, USA, offered a reward of twenty-five gold pounds for a hymn. The main idea had to be carefully considered, regarding international relations, peace, and, importantly, contain Christian spirit. This would qualify for the award. Finally, they also sacrificed twenty-five gold pounds for a beautiful musical score for this hymn. At the same time, they announced that the winner for 1929 was Mrs. Many Rowland of England, who won the prize for expert hymns, and Dr. Tweedy of Yale Divinity School in the United States won the prize for church hymns. Because both England and the United States are Christian countries, many poets are working hard to create hymns, hoping to leave a lingering charm on people's lips, so that they can become famous through this. The deadline for this prize essay was set on May 1st, and all texts were also decided to be in English.</p>
