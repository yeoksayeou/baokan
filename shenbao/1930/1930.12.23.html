<h3>世界軍縮之新消息</h3>

<p>其一爲美國前國務卿羅特現充卡尼其國際和平基金委員者發表一文謂列强於大戰後誘引德國减縮軍備且允各自减縮及今宜從速踐行此約勿稍延緩實爲列强至要之義務美國亦當在内全世界宜注重此節云云此乃追遡以往歷史而有此軍縮之警告也其二爲英國薛西爾子爵由國際聯盟同志會發出軍縮之請願謂第一次世界軍縮大會大約可於一九三二年初開幕者究竟是眞是僞將繫於一九三一年内輿論之運動苟此大會不能使各國締結一約以停止各種軍備之競爭使之受有效力之限制而促成軍備之大减縮則國際和平之全部結構行將動摇矣云云此乃推測將來之危險而有此軍縮之警告也有此兩番警告軍縮一事之於明年必不至寂寂無聞依然如故也</p>

<h3>歐游通訊（九十一）劉海栗</h3>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（十四）</p>
<p>六月四日大伽藍聖彼得梵諦剛敎皇宮西施庭敎堂</p>
<p>這聖彼得大寺經過了勃萊曼特DONATOBRAMANTE深文周内的設計米克朗琪羅MICHELANGELO雄奇瓌偉的想像最後則由勃尼尼BERNINI斟酌安排築以兩側的圓頂和門外的廊柱他用巧妙的透視法使人瞻仰的時候覺得正面比實際更形宏壯崇高就是那前面一片廣塲也因爲這無數巨大石柱的環供在人們的感覺上倍感廣大並且他更利用聳立中央的大穹窿給建築全體以統一的機能所以我們無論從那一方面觀看總覺得處處是（美）是（大）像這個莊嚴宏大的詭異的建築物才可配得上說是文藝復興和宗敎改革的象徴物也可以配得上說它是足以代表文藝復興期的文化類型</p>
<p>這大伽藍裏面還珍藏着一件文藝復興期的瓌寳我幾乎將它忘記了就是米克朗琪羅二十四歲那時候所作的呌做LAPIETA的那個雕像這雕像是表現聖母對於基督死體之憐憫的情緒那種作風是與他後來的傑作摩西像或梅諦西陵墓上的雕像是絶然不同的這是米克朗琪羅的初期作品在他全部作品中的最靜穆而深刻的一個米克朗琪羅後年的發揮便是始基於此其特點在於能將聖母的慘容深刻地表出同時又不失其間的尊嚴之儀範藴蓄之深令人低徊肅默向没有宗敎信仰而性格崛强的我在這個石像之下不禁帖然這是宗敎的感人還是藝術的感人</p>
<p>這裏的大建築很多不止是聖彼得伽藍在左面還有許多巍然峙立着的建物像做聖彼得伽藍的屏障似的這便是世界最有名的梵諦剛敎士宮我從前時常想我倘能倘徉於道個爲藝術寳藏的敎土宮我就是獲得人世的尊榮現在我進了敎王宮其欣快的情形當然非筆墨所能形容的了這敎王宮是五世紀已開始經營其後隨時增築一直至現代崇高偉大的建築並列於連續之中内包含着博物院西施庭敎堂等的是世界無比的寳藏</p>

<h3>生理胎産學與病理胎産學陳保勤</h3>
<p>楊元吉著</p>
<p>我國素稱爲世界人口最多的國家這一點或者是中華民族可以自豪的地方其原因當然是由於我國幅圓廣大歷史久長的確是現代任何國家所不可及的可是因爲中國民族性缺少研究與發展的精神事事總是抱着因襲和傳統的思想所以到了現在雖然是數千年文化早開的古國反而不如幾百年的新進後起的國家因之可以自豪的人口第一也將發生動摇我國人口率在最近百年間據中山先生說幾無所增加所以我國邊界的地方至今仍有地廣人稀之患例如邊蒙西藏關東各地遂逐漸爲外人侵占蠶食將有完全變爲他們殖民地的趨向這是多麽值得我們注意的一件事天然的土地森林自已不去開墾種植反將富源讓給外人中國今日的窮困誰能否認不是一半由於民族的不善經營呢近年國務會議上對於蒙藏問題未嘗不加以切實的討論但實際上總不免有鞭長莫及之苦那有實力去阻止他們不侵占呢考各國人民之所以不惜艱苦䟦涉山海來到中國的邊界以及其他荒僻之地的原因無非是爲生計所迫和他們民族之富有勇敢性土地的生産力是有限定的像他們人口增加的速度這樣快本國内天産物當然供不能應求了跟着生存競爭的自然現象祇有向着可以謀生存的地方去謀生存因此在政治方面他們執政的人也就利用這種自然的趨向實施擴張版圖的政策所以有獎勵生育課稅獨身的條文我國不用說是事事落後加以中原各省天産豐富供不應求的時候是很少的因以人民的就慣享其成了那裏還肯去吃那辛苦開墾邊界呢可是現在的潮流已經到了危險的時期你不去開墾别人就去開墾了你不去經營别人就去經營了你自已不把脚步站得穩别人就要來推倒你了拿最近情形來說因爲我們近年來人口少有增加别國人增加得這樣快所以在中國的外國人比任何國家全要多這已是中國將陷爲各國殖民地的前驅症狀這種現象除非先知先覺的孫總理久經察覺之外是很少被人注意到的</p>
<p>中國人口爲什麽增加得這樣慢呢牠的原因就是因爲科學太不發達醫學太不科學化了並且明明屬於醫學範圍的産科學裏的助産一職竟委諸毫無知識的穩婆之手殊不知這是關係二命存亡不有充足的産科學識和經騐的人是萬難負此責任中國醫學不知注意及此所以爲生産而死於非命的寃魂正不知有多少呢這樣一來對於人口率要不要降低呢在没有醫學知識的人以爲是天命其實與助産的人缺少産科學識與之有</p>
<p>直接關係</p>
<p>最近數年中國醫學已有發達的現象因此對於産科一門也特别加以重視起來專門人才的培養在上海已有幾處學校設立可是産科學敎本在醫學不發達的中國當然是很不容找到看外國書不免又要感覺文字上的不便楊君有鑑於此乃搜集平日的敎材着成這兩本産科的專書其中備述姙娠前後正常與異常的現象以及應施的術雖然是産科醫生所必讀的書籍同時也是婦女以及一般人所應具知識因爲生育一事差不多是任何人所不可免的難道一個做丈夫的不担心着自已妻子分娩時候的危險麽有了相當知識之後庶可防患於未然同時也關係於民族盛衰問題我們更應該注意了</p>

<h3>Inauguration of Ministers of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Hu Hanmin Bestows Seals</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui Presides Over the Oath</p>
<p>Nanjing - The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan Wang Zhengting, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Minister of Transportation Wang Boqun, Minister of Railways Sun Ke, Minister of Industries Kong Xiangxi, Acting Minister of Interior Zhang Weihua, Political Vice Minister of Education Li Shuhua, Permanent Vice Minister Chen Bulei, Member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Ma Fuxiang, and Chairman of the Opium Suppression Commission Liu Ruiheng, held their swearing-in ceremony at the State Council Memorial Week on the morning of the 22nd. Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Enkebatu, Li Wenfan, Niu Yongjian, He Yaozu, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Yi, and representatives of various agencies and staff of the State Council, totaling over 300 people, attended. After Chairman Hu Hanmin performed the ceremony, the seal bestowing ceremony was held first. Hu Hanmin bestowed seals to Wang Zhengting, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Wang Boqun, Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Weihua, Ma Fuxiang, and Liu Ruiheng, who successively received the seals. Next was the swearing-in ceremony, where each minister and chairman of the commission raised their right hand to take the oath, presided over by Wang Chonghui, who gave a brief address stating that the esteemed members have been working in various ministries and commissions for a long time and have been able to work hard. Now, due to the reorganization, they continue to serve and should be able to competently and happily fulfill their duties. The Executive Yuan has been established for more than two years, but the counter-revolutionary elements have repeatedly sabotaged the National Revolution, so that various administrative plans have not been fully implemented. Now that the counter-revolutionary elements have been completely eliminated, the esteemed members should be able to realize the plans of the past few years based on past experience. The government has now scheduled a National Assembly and is determined to carry out rectification, which are all good signs for the country's future. However, now that the military affairs are over and unification is achieved, the responsibilities of the esteemed members are even greater than before. It is hoped that the esteemed members will implement the existing plans as soon as possible and formulate new plans as soon as possible. The esteemed members have either followed the Premier for many years or have contributed to the Party and the country. In the future, they should take the Premier's spirit of "everything for the public" as their spirit and the Premier's will as their will, strive to carry out their work, and complete the Premier's legacy. Today, I wish you all good health. Next, Chairman Hu Hanmin gave a brief address stating that in the past, the people had many demands on politics, but due to time and space limitations, they could not be fulfilled. However, we have set the period of political tutelage for six years, and two years have already passed. In the next four years, we must strive for the happiness of the people and cultivate good habits of the people under constitutional government so that they can fully enjoy civil rights. In the past, the administrative organs were repeatedly obstructed by warlords and counter-revolutionaries, and all politics could not be fully developed, but they勉强勉强maintained or responded to emergencies. It was not easy to promote politics in difficulties. Now that the military affairs have been settled and the Fourth Plenary Session has resolved to revitalize politics, the esteemed members can proceed according to the established plans and programs to comfort the people and the government's hopes. Next, Song Ziwen gave a representative answer, stating that the colleagues were very grateful for the understanding of the central government that they had not been able to work effectively in the past due to various reasons. This time, they sincerely accept the resolution of the Party and the instructions of the two commissions to work hard. Since 1919, there has not been a day without war. Now there is an opportunity. If we do not work hard, we will not only be sorry for ourselves, but also for the Party and the country. From now on, we will be determined to abandon old habits, revitalize our spirits, and work hard. We hope that the committee members and colleagues will guide us from time to time. The ceremony ended at 11:30 a.m. with music and dismissal. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>New News on World Disarmament</h3>
<p>Since the signing of the London Naval Disarmament Treaty, the world has long been indifferent to the matter of disarmament. Even if there are those who speak of it, they only express their dissatisfaction with the fact that disarmament has achieved nothing. Unexpectedly, at the end of the year, there are those who are revisiting the old topic, which shows that there are still those in the world who cannot forget the matter of disarmament.</p>
<p>One is that former US Secretary of State Root, who is now a member of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, published an article stating that the great powers induced Germany to reduce its armaments after the Great War and promised to reduce their own armaments. Now, they should implement this agreement as soon as possible and without delay. This is the most important obligation of the great powers, and the United States should also be included. The whole world should pay attention to this point. This is a warning about disarmament based on a review of past history. The other is that Viscount Cecil of Great Britain issued a petition for disarmament from the League of Nations Association, stating that the first World Disarmament Conference is expected to open in early 1932. Whether this is true or false will depend on the movement of public opinion in 1931. If this conference cannot enable the countries to conclude an agreement to stop the competition of various armaments, limit them effectively, and promote a large reduction of armaments, then the entire structure of international peace will be shaken. This is a warning about disarmament based on the prediction of future dangers. With these two warnings, the matter of disarmament will not be silent and unchanged next year.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Prevents Tax Thugs from Causing Trouble</h3>
<p>Nanjing - The Ministry of Finance presented a report to the Executive Yuan on the 22nd, stating that abuses must be prevented at the beginning of the implementation of the rectification, because most of the tax thugs have not disappeared.

The self-defense ability of ordinary cargo customers and boat households is inherently weak, and they will inevitably suffer greatly, which will greatly hinder the future of eliminating the chaff policy. It is requested that the provinces be ordered to order the county officials to be responsible for supervising the public security police to strictly investigate and arrest them at any time.

<h3>International Telegram Trunk Line Fee</h3>

<p>Important Foreign News</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Failure of the Spanish Revolution</h3>
<p>Seemingly Inadequate Preparations</p>
<p>Part of the Army Certainly Harboring Doubts</p>
<p>Two Socialist Leaders Arrested</p>
<p>Franco Plans to Flee to South America</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 21st: Today's "Times" carries a dispatch from Madrid stating the reasons for the failure of the Spanish revolution. It is claimed that Colonel Pengjialan's uprising in Jekai was three days earlier than planned, and because of Mr. Peng's negligence, the government learned of it and was prepared. Furthermore, the workers in Madrid had already received weapons and ammunition, and were originally scheduled to revolt in response to the arrival of revolutionary aircraft in the capital. However, the final order to revolt failed to reach the workers' leaders. It is also said that although the army supported the government this time, many sympathized with the revolutionaries. For example, the army aircraft ordered to pursue the aircraft carrying the revolutionary Franco and others deliberately allowed them to escape, and the artillery teams sent to bomb the army airfield near the capital and the mountain paths near Jekai deliberately missed, with the shells flying over the heads of the revolutionaries. This is all clear evidence. Moreover, the government's secret agents knew nothing of the revolutionary leaders' ability to organize such a national movement, which also shows the direction of public opinion. Therefore, although the government was able to quickly put down the rebellion, its actual position is not very solid.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 21st: Today, the Spanish police arrested the two socialist leaders, Caballero and Rius, and three military officers involved in the Jekai uprising. In addition, 84 people were arrested in the Pierre Bao area. There have been no reports of unrest in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 21st: Today's special meeting of the Portuguese cabinet decided to grant exit passports to Spanish revolutionary officers fleeing into Portugal. Major Franco and a military officer have received passports to France, Germany, Argentina, and Uruguay. It is rumored that they plan to go to South America first and then return to Europe.</p>
<h3>The Status of the French Steeg Cabinet is Gradually Becoming More Solid</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 22nd: Judging from the two partial elections on Sunday, the national trend has shifted towards the right wing. This is indeed a good omen for the Steeg cabinet. Mr. Steeg is also actively reorganizing the internal structure of the cabinet. It is rumored that there will be slight changes in personnel selection. Interior Minister Mr. Liggs will be transferred to be the Minister of the Navy, and the vacant position of Interior Minister will be filled by Mr. Salart. In short, the Steeg cabinet is much more solid than it was a few days ago.</p>
<h3>British Viscount Cecil Petitions for the Promotion of Military Reduction</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: British Viscount Cecil, speaking on behalf of the International League of Comrades, issued a petition for military reduction today, stating that 1931 will be an urgent year for the League of Nations. The first World Disarmament Conference is expected to open in 1932. Whether it is true or false will depend on the movement of public opinion in 1931. If this conference fails to enable countries to conclude an agreement to stop the competition of various armaments, to subject them to effective restrictions, and to promote a large reduction in armaments, the entire structure of international peace will be shaken. The draft disarmament treaty is not perfect, but it can serve as the basis for an effective disarmament convention. If public opinion can be created in 1931 to focus on the need for overall disarmament, it will be of great value, because public opinion can enable the governments concerned to propose the lowest figures at the conference for inclusion in the convention.</p>
<h3>The 19th Japanese Diet to be Convened Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: The procedures for the establishment of the 59th Japanese Imperial Diet have been decided as follows: On December 24th at 9:00 AM, members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will gather to elect their respective leaders and declare the Diet established. At 11:00 AM on the 26th, the Emperor will visit the House of Peers to hold the opening ceremony. The House of Representatives will convene at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. On the 27th, the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will elect committee chairmen, standing committee members, and resolve the reply to the Emperor, and then adjourn. As usual, the end-of-year Diet will be merely formal and should proceed smoothly without incident. However, the Seiyukai may use the name of emergency questions to question the government on whether Prime Minister Hamaguchi is allowed to attend the Diet, with only Acting Prime Minister Shidehara and Interior Minister Adachi responding, hoping to stir up a wave. However, since government cabinet members do not attend the end-of-year Diet, and the Speaker is not allowed to change the schedule, the Seiyukai's plan may be difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>Division of Factions in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: According to an announcement by the Secretariat of the House of Representatives, as of December 21st, the division of factions in the House of Representatives is as follows: Minseito 267 members, Seiyukai 171 members, Kokumin Doshikai 6 members, Kakushin Club 3 members, Shakai Minshuto 2 members, Taishuto 2 members, Rōnōto 1 member, neutral 5 members, unaffiliated 3 members (including the Speaker and Vice-Speaker). Vacancies: 6 members. Total: 466 members.</p>
<p>Anti-Government Atmosphere Strong in the House of Peers</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: The focus of interest in this Diet is not in the House of Representatives, which has an absolute majority with the ruling party, but in the House of Peers. Now, let us examine the attitude of each faction in the House of Peers towards the Diet. The Research Society, an anti-government faction, will attack the government on the Tainan Incident and the unemployment problem. The Koseikai will argue that the Musha Incident was caused by the erroneous pacification policy of the Governor-General of Taiwan, and Yoshiro Murai will raise questions. Also, Nagayasu Ikeda will raise the issue of the naval disarmament treaty and question Foreign Minister Shidehara. However, the association still has members such as Yoshiro Sakatani who have goodwill towards the government and can mediate and avoid taking an attitude of impeaching the government. The Koyukai has the strongest anti-government color and will do its best to attack the government's misgovernment, especially Nagaoka, who will raise his most proud social policy to attack Interior Minister Adachi. The Dowakai is the opposite of the Koyukai, and most of its members are from the ruling party and will support the government, with Izawa Takio and others as the center, and will help the government seal the mouths of opposing Diet members. The Kayokai is a group of dukes and marquises, and the result is the strongest, and everything will follow the lead of the leader. The diplomatic policy towards China, the Musha Incident, and the closure of the Joseon Bank are all regarded as new materials and should be paid attention to and may also throw a stone and cause waves.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi, Ailing, Meets with Party Leaders</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: It has been 39 days since Prime Minister Hamaguchi was attacked. Today, he was allowed to meet with political figures for the first time. At 2:00 PM today, he met with Acting Prime Minister Shidehara and Chief Cabinet Secretary Ki. After Acting Prime Minister Shidehara reported on government affairs, he asked for his instructions regarding the replacement of eight vacant seats for Imperial-appointed members, and also mentioned countermeasures for the Diet. The attending physician hoped that the meeting time would be within 5 minutes, so it was not very deep. At 11:00 AM on the 23rd, he will meet with Interior Minister Adachi and General Secretaries Tomita, Hara, and Sakurauchi. On the 24th and 25th, he will meet with President Sengoku of the South Manchuria Railway for consultations.</p>
<p>After Interior Minister Adachi reported on party affairs, he received instructions regarding the re-election of officials. Also, President Sengoku hopes that Foreign Minister Shidehara will continue to act as Prime Minister so that Prime Minister Hamaguchi can fully recuperate. The attending physician temporarily prohibits anyone other than those mentioned above from meeting with him.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Adjourns</h3>
<p>Finally Passes Emergency Relief Funding for Unemployment</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st: Congress passed $311 million in emergency relief funding for unemployment and then passed $150 million to continue funding the Agricultural Bureau to maintain agricultural product prices. It then adjourned today for half a month. The Agricultural Bureau's funding had been approved by Congress for $500 million, and two batches totaling $400 million have now been approved.</p>

<p>Three Earthquakes in Tainan</p>
<p>Hot Springs Emerge in the City</p>
<p>Ground Cracks and Houses Collapse</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tainan, 22nd: At 7:50 this morning, Tainan was hit by another strong earthquake. The citizens, who had not yet recovered from the previous earthquake, all fled outdoors. At 8:08 and 8:26, there were two more shocks, causing considerable shaking. Roads cracked, and many houses collapsed. In Uchimachi in the city, hot springs suddenly emerged. Although the water volume is not large, it continues to gush out. The epicenter seems to be in the mountains near Anping. Many houses have collapsed, and the losses seem quite large.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: The rumble was continuous during the Tainan earthquake. It is now known that a total of 12 people were injured, 72 houses were completely destroyed, 328 were partially destroyed, and 4,700 were damaged.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Saving Silver from its Low Price from the Erfen Trust Company</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th: The Erfen Trust Company expressed its opinion in its semi-monthly commercial report that among the difficulties facing global industry and commerce, the one that can be solved is the silver problem. It stated that the unrest in India and the economic panic in China are mainly caused by the low price of silver. If this is the case, then the impact of this situation has not yet been realized. The facts have clearly pointed out the nature of the required relief methods. It is now hoped that if Western countries do not want to plunge the East into deeper suffering, then short-sighted nationalism and theoretical discussions on bimetallism will not obstruct a kind of legislation that is absolutely necessary. If the treasuries of the major Western commercial countries buy millions of ounces of silver each year to increase the silver content in their coins and issue silver subsidiary coins to replace banknotes, then beneficial effects can be produced. The Gold Delegation of the League of Nations has expressed concern that within a few years, the supply of gold will be insufficient to maintain the gold standard and increasing debt. Now, to reduce this concern, there should be an agreement on how countries that have not yet adopted the gold standard should carefully handle it and not hastily apply the gold standard to half of the world's population, who regard silver as currency rather than as a commodity. Ignoring this point would be a major psychological and political mistake. To improve the current situation, it is not necessary to act solely out of altruism. Helping our Eastern friends is helping ourselves, because stopping the decline in the price of silver is to initiate a force that can raise general prices and strengthen international commerce. If Europe and the United States promote the use of silver in coins, the gold standard can be greatly consolidated, and the comparative stability and permanence of the gold standard can also be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>London Engulfed in Dense Fog</h3>
<p>Collisions and Groundings Occur Repeatedly</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: Dense fog engulfed London today and spread to eastern and southeastern England, causing severe traffic disruption and many collisions and groundings. The most serious of these, according to a Reuters reporter in Hamburg, was that the Danish gasoline tanker "Malaya" (8,654 tons) collided with the steamer "George Washington" at the mouth of the Elbe River yesterday and immediately ran aground. It was initially reported that the "Malaya" was fully loaded with soybeans and that water saturation threatened to rupture the hull. Today, it was learned that the cargo had been unloaded, and the ship was safe.</p>
<h3>Three Disturbances in Berlin in One Day</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 21st: As Christmas approaches, the public's attention to political parties and the parliament is gradually decreasing. Unexpectedly, three serious disturbances suddenly occurred in Berlin today. First, countless working-class women went to the major vegetable markets to demonstrate, demanding price cuts for daily necessities. In some places, they rushed into the vegetable markets to snatch meat, vegetables, and bread. The police had difficulty stopping them. At the same time, Republican pacifists staged demonstrations in western Berlin, opposing the historical film "Frederick Rex" and denouncing its excessive militarism. They nearly clashed with nationalists. Fortunately, the police intervened and arrested many people, preventing a major accident. Finally, in the evening, communists vandalized the windows of the Greek consulate, throwing stones wrapped in leaflets protesting the death sentences of two Greek communist soldiers. By the time the police arrived, the communists had already dispersed. Regarding the death sentences, the great scientist Professor Albert Einstein had also telegraphed the Greek Prime Minister to protest. The Greek Prime Minister did not give a sympathetic reply.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Broadcasts to the U.S.</h3>
<p>Outlining Steps Toward Peace</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: British Foreign Secretary Henderson broadcast a radio message to the United States today, outlining the steps towards peace in 1930. He said that the events in China that year allowed one to hope that internal strife in China had been permanently ended. He considered this the most promising scene and an indication that Western countries would soon be able to agree on various outstanding issues with China and seek mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: The protective tariffs on gloves, scissors, razor blades, etc., expired today, and the government's policy against protectionism took effect. According to this morning's protectionist newspapers, ships fully loaded with the above-mentioned goods will arrive at British ports within a few days.</p>

<p>Official Telegrams</p>
<h3>Telegram from Hankou</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: I have received a telegram from Director Gong Bingfan of the New 7th Division from the commander-in-chief. It states that the communist bandits have occupied the Donggu headquarters for many years. Director Wang of my department led troops in two routes to attack and engage in fierce fighting. Thanks to your virtuous power, we captured it at noon, killing many bandits, including Mao Zedong, and seizing countless rifles, mortars, swords, and spears. The remaining bandits are fleeing towards Longshan and are being pursued. As Donggu is the general headquarters of the communist bandits, the terrain is extremely dangerous, and many bandits are gathered there. This time, thanks to the divine power of the commander-in-chief and the soldiers' lives, we were able to sweep away the cave and annihilate the ringleaders. The demonic atmosphere has been cleansed and can be achieved in a short time. I am specially telegraphing this victory to you. Respectfully, Yang Yin, Department of Political Training, Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Nanjing</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: I have received an order from the National Government to appoint Shao Yuanchong as Chairman of the Examination Commission, and so forth. I was sworn in on the 20th of this month. I believe that governing a country begins with talent, and the examination is the way to seek talent. As I am of meager talent, I have taken on this heavy responsibility. I am deeply concerned about the new creation of the scale and my ability to fulfill it. I hope to receive your support so that I can use my strength. I am sending this special telegram to you. Respectfully, Shao Yuanchong.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Memorial Weeks of the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, the Central Party Headquarters held the 91st Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Great Hall. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Chu Minyi, Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Ma Chaojun, Chen Yaoyuan, Yu Jingtang, etc., and staff members of various departments and guests, totaling about 500 to 600 people, attended. After Chairman Hu Hanmin performed the ceremony, Chu Minyi reported on his participation in the Belgian Centennial Exposition and the election of the League of Nations. He stated that China's industry and commerce are still in their infancy. If they are used to represent the national culture to compete with the world's industrial and commercial countries, it will not be easy. When soliciting exhibits this time, manufacturers and shops were concerned that the exhibits would not be returned after the competition, and they were worried about the loss, so the collection was very difficult. The Organizing Committee then collected in various ways and was responsible for stating that there would be three types of collections: (1) items for sale would be valued; (2) items not for sale would be returned; and (3) gifts to increase advertising efficiency. The exhibits were divided into three categories: agriculture, industry, and education, totaling 208 boxes. As a result of the competition, 337 medals were won, but most of the exhibits were handmade, and there were few mechanical products. Due to the narrowness of the site, the display was inevitably crude and simple, and the new inventions of science only had specimens and lacked on-site experimental personnel, making it difficult to attract people's attention. Therefore, the results obtained were still a fluke and should not be considered satisfactory. It is felt that there is little connection between China's occupation and education. Often, what is learned is not what is used, and what is used is not what is learned. Moreover, the banks and shipping industries on which industry and commerce rely are far inferior to the development of other countries. Foreign-operated banks and shipping companies in China are increasing daily, while Chinese banks and shipping companies rarely promote themselves overseas. If the economy does not lag behind, how can this be achieved? If we can catch up and strive together, there will be many opportunities for progress in the future. The Chicago Exposition will be held in the United States in 1933 (the 22nd year of the Republic), and the Brussels Exposition will be held in 1935 (the 24th year of the Republic). China must participate. During these three to five years, it is hoped that domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce will be improved day by day, and future glory will be sought. If foreigners can improve our inventions and surpass us, why can't we imitate the inventions of foreigners first and then study the improvements to surpass foreigners? As for the fact that our country failed to be elected to the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, it was not because the representatives could not work hard, but because the international competition was very complicated. Our country's position was not dominant due to insufficient combined strength, and our country's large expenses to the League of Nations also had an impact. In particular, the frequent domestic rebellions and the lack of political unity were enough for foreigners to seize on. Fortunately, the reorganization of the International Court of Justice resulted in Wang Liangchou being elected as a judge (a total of 15 judges). The position of this judge is very important. All legal disputes between countries must be resolved in this court. This is Wang's honor and the country's honor. It can be said that it was half failure and half success. In the future, as national politics gets on track, diplomatic strength will inevitably increase, and the international position can be expected to increase. The next election of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations will definitely have great hope. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>The National Government held Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:30 AM on the same day. Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, Enkebatu, He Yaoguzu, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Zhengting, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Wang Boqun, Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Ruiheng, Li Shuhua, Chen Bulei, Zhang Weihua, Lin Xiang, Zhu Lühe, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, and staff members of various departments and committees of the National Government, totaling more than 300 people, attended.</p>
<p>After Chairman Hu Hanmin performed the ceremony, Mr. Hu lectured on the evils of the likin system and the Central Government's determination to abolish likin, as well as plans for future fiscal reorganization. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Request Guanwai to Assist Jinpu Railway with Cars</h3>
<p>Sun Hegao Arrives in Tianjin to Negotiate</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In recent years, due to the impact of the war, the business of various railways has declined. The Jinpu Railway is particularly the worst. The railway administration is controlled by the military, who only know how to use the vehicles without protecting them. As a result, more than 3,000 original passenger and freight cars have been mostly damaged, and only more than 500 remain. The monthly income is less than one million. The main line of the railway is 2,700 kilometers long, and the income is so low that it can be described as extremely dismal. After the war, the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan Railways held a meeting in Xuzhou to sort out the vehicles of each railway, but no results were achieved. As a result, the Jinpu Railway's plan to increase the number of train services could not be implemented. At present, not only is freight transportation hindered, but passenger transportation cannot meet the needs of passengers. Direct train services are only available every other day, and the crowding situation is rare. Not only is there no room to insert a foot inside the car, but also passengers are standing on the platform outside the car. In the face of the piercing wind, they often lose consciousness due to freezing. The railway authorities recently intend to ask Guanwai to return some of the unused and discarded cars for repair and use by the railway. Sun Hegao, the director of the railway bureau, came north on the 16th to inspect the situation along the railway and met with Deputy Commander Zhang and Gao Jiyi, the director of the Bei Ning Railway Bureau, to discuss the issue of borrowing cars. He arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 18th. According to Sun, in addition to inspecting the northern section of the railway, he also planned to discuss with Gao Jiyi the issue of assisting with vehicles to facilitate transportation. Gao Jun has generously agreed to find a way. He will stay in Tianjin for a few days and then go to Beiping to return south before the lunar new year. He also said that the Jinpu Railway had more than 3,000 old passenger and freight cars. Over the years, the railway has been the starting point for wars, so it has suffered the most. Since taking office last year, he has repeatedly repaired, collected, and newly purchased ten locomotives. The number of passenger and freight cars has gradually recovered to more than 1,400. Unexpectedly, during the Shi Yousan Incident, a large number of cars were taken away. Then, during the campaign to suppress Tang, the Jinpu Railway was relied upon for transportation, and the cars were gone without return.</p>
<p>By this year's Central Plains War, the damage was even more severe. To this day, the total number of vehicles is no more than 600, and the damaged ones still account for half. There are still more than 500 cars detained by other troops. Although there are no obstacles to transportation at present, the difficulty of vehicles falling short of demand is really a pity. It is now planned to do our best to reorganize and operate skillfully. It is hoped that the monthly income will be 1.4 million yuan. If 400,000 yuan is deposited monthly, more than 2.4 million yuan can be obtained in half a year to purchase new cars and gradually increase income. If the original state of 1,400 tons can be restored, a monthly income of 3 million yuan can be earned, and the railway administration may have hope of progress. (18th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Inner Harbor Holds Groundbreaking Ceremony</h3>
<p>Government and Business Advance Funds to Build Harbor, Contract Signed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The construction of the embankment project to open up the inner harbor at Zhou Tou Zui in Henan, Guangzhou, has been underway for two months. The plan is scheduled to be completed in 21 months, requiring an engineering cost of approximately 2 million yuan. Four warehouses and 12 wharves are planned to be built in the inner harbor for foreign merchant ships to load and unload and store goods. The first phase of the project is to build a river embankment along the river, which began in February. Once the embankment is completed, the construction of wharves and warehouses will follow, as well as the buildings in the inner harbor. The first phase of the harbor construction cost is 640,000 yuan, of which 320,000 yuan will be allocated by the Guangzhou Municipal Works Bureau and 320,000 yuan will be borrowed by the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce. The contract between the government and business has been signed after several discussions until the 14th of this month. At the same time, the groundbreaking ceremony for the inner harbor was also held on the 17th of this month. Prior to the ceremony, a large shed was built in front of the Tongren Hospital in Zhou Tou Zui, Henan, as the ceremonial stage, with the party and national flags and the portrait of the Premier hanging above. Four painted boats were arranged in front of the shore as a place to receive guests, and four electric boats were used for transportation. On that day, those who attended the ceremony included Deng Yanhua, Director of the Construction Department, the heads of various bureaus of the Municipal Government, representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of various institutions and organizations, totaling several hundred people. Chairman Lin Yun was absent due to business, and Cheng Tianguo replaced him. The groundbreaking ceremony was held at 2:00 pm. The music was played in turn, the party song was sung, and the reasons for the meeting were announced. Then the cornerstone was unveiled. The cornerstone was inscribed with the words (Groundbreaking of the Inner Harbor of Guangzhou, November 12th, 19th Year of the Republic of China, Lin Yunhai, Cheng Tianguo, Stone Erected), etc. Then representatives of the provincial government, the municipal party headquarters, and the chamber of commerce delivered speeches one after another. The cannon was fired and photos were taken at 3:30 pm, and the ceremony dispersed. The original text of the contract between the government and business to build the port is attached as follows: (Article 1) The Guangzhou Municipal Works Bureau is planning to build the inner harbor of Zhou Tou Zui in Henan. In order to seek cooperation between the government and business, the Municipal Government has approved the embankment construction cost of 640,000 yuan. The government and business will each raise an average of funds. The Guangzhou Municipal Works Bureau will allocate 320,000 yuan from its own funds, and the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce will borrow 320,000 yuan. (Article 2) Both parties will allocate 19,000 yuan each month for this embankment construction funding, starting from the start of the project in June of the 19th year. Thereafter, both parties will allocate funds according to the completion of each section of the inner harbor construction project. (Article 3) The Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce has appointed three representatives to be responsible for supervising the various projects of the construction of the embankment and allocate daily funding. The representatives will report on a regular basis. If the funds are to be paid, they will be allocated accordingly. If the project fails to proceed according to the regulations, the funds will be suspended. The funds borrowed by the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce each month shall not exceed 19,000 yuan. The amount borne by the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce itself shall not exceed 320,000 yuan. (Article 4) The Guangzhou Municipal Works Bureau has been approved by the Municipal Government to hand over each wharf and land lot in the inner harbor to the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce for public bidding at any time in order to repay the funds obtained.

<h3>Jinan Telephone Company Appeal Hearing</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case between the Jinan Telephone Company and the Japanese-owned Dongtuo Company has been litigated. The telephone company filed an appeal against the judgment of the local court to repay the debt. Yesterday (the 19th) at 2:00 pm, the Shandong Higher Court summoned both parties to hold a hearing. The judges in court were Ding Yikui, the clerk Yan Huaqi, and the translators Jiang Yisheng and Pan Yi. The appellant's agents were Yan Chenghan (lawyer) and Jia Rongqing (lawyer). The appellee's agents were Yoshida Chen (defense lawyer) and the translator Ugaji Takaomi. The judge asked the appellee's agent and translator for their names and ages, and then immediately ordered the appellant's agent to express his opinion.</p>
<p>The appellant's agent, Yan Chenghan, expressed his opinion, saying that the case should first study the law and then state the facts. (1) It is not yet certain whether the seal of the director on the contract for the appellee to lend 440,000 yuan to the telephone company is true or not, and it is not necessary to discuss it. Even if it is assumed that the director's seal and Ma Guanhe's guarantee are true, the telephone company cannot be held responsible. The company's scope is its business, and the directors and managers have no other rights outside the scope of business. According to the company regulations, the manager is not allowed to hold company bonds, and Article 199 stipulates that the company bonds shall not be raised without the resolution of a special board of directors, and the amount of the bonds shall not exceed the amount of capital. This provision is to prevent the directors and managers from acting without authorization. In civil and commercial law, it can be analogized and extrapolated. Dongtuo lent the Jinan Telephone Company 440,000 yuan. Ma Guanhe was the manager and had no right to borrow money. Even if the director seals the contract, it violates the company regulations. The Japanese Company Law Article 190 also has the same provision. The appellee is a Japanese and is a company. He should know that the huge amount of 440,000 yuan should not be authorized by the director. The above is about the principal debt, and the telephone company is not responsible for repayment. (2) Regarding the guaranteed debt (that is, the subordinate debt), the directors and managers have very strict restrictions on holding company bonds, so they naturally have no right to guarantee loans. Furthermore, the loan contract should be studied. The borrower is Jinan Commercial Port, the guarantor is Jinan Telephone Company, and the following six people include the manager Ma Guanhe and the director Ma Huijie (that is, Ma Guanhe). Among the borrower and the guarantor, seven people include three who are the same person. This is in terms of form. In terms of content, no matter what the clause is, the contract specifies that the telephone company is the guarantee, and the telephone company's assets are also used as the guarantee. In this way, the appellee believes that the telephone company is the borrower, and it can be said that the telephone company borrowed money, but the borrower wrote Ma Guanhe. The appellee already knew that the director and manager had no such authority, so he ambiguously and cleverly made this malicious contract. It is clear at a glance at the terms. Moreover, this loan clearly contains political effects. It is thought to take the telephone company as stipulated in the contract, and continue to borrow money in the future. If a foreign accounting technician is used, he must be recommended by Dongtuo. If an electric unified company is established in the future, Dongtuo must borrow money. If a foreign accountant is used by the unified company, Dongtuo must also recommend it. If the company is transferred to others in the future, it must first consult with Dongtuo, etc. The term "colonial development" has the meaning of a colony. When the Qingdao Jiaoji Railway was still in the hands of the Japanese in the tenth year of the Republic of China, Dongtuo had the possibility of taking over the telephone company. At that time, if the loan was made in the name of the company, a shareholders' meeting must be held, and this harsh contract would not be approved. Therefore, a contract was made that was not a telephone company loan in form, but a telephone company loan in content. Its intention to take over the telephone company is obvious and should be noted by your court.</p>
<p>Next, the appellant's agent, lawyer Jia Rongqing, supplemented his opinion, saying that the original judgment had two points. (1) The telephone company is jointly and severally liable as the guarantor on the contract, and the telephone company is the debtor of the subordinate debt. (2) The borrowed money is used to expand the telephone company and is naturally responsible, so the telephone company is the debtor of the principal debt. The judgment did not distinguish between the debt of the principal debtor and the subordinate debtor, and it was vaguely judged. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the contract is true or false. The hard judgment is even more unreasonable. Now, assuming that the contract is true, the telephone company cannot be jointly and severally liable because the contract says that the director has sealed it. The company director is the legal representative of the legal person and has a limited power of attorney, that is, the laws of all countries stipulate that the director has the power of attorney for the company's business, and there is no power of attorney outside the scope of business. In terms of the first point of guaranteed debt, the telephone company is not a guarantor for others, and it is certainly not responsible for the loan and the telephone company has no interest in it. The position of the director is equivalent to the manager of an ordinary business. According to the precedent of the Dali Court and the precedent of the Supreme Court, the manager cannot borrow money except for money merchants. The second point of the principal debt cannot be responsible either because the contract is completely malicious to the telephone company, and the agent colluded with Dongtuo to plot the telephone company and the contract is not legally effective. Article 5 of the contract lists the machines, real estate, etc. of the telephone company in the list of mortgages. According to Article 9 of the Regulations on Private Telephone by the Ministry of Transportation, machines and real estate cannot be mortgaged. Now the agent is brazenly doing it, which is a violation of the law. The telephone company cannot repay the debt. (The above words were all translated by the translators Uga and Yoshida) Judge Ding asked how many directors did the telephone company have in the tenth year of the Republic of China? Yan Chenghan replied, An Shan, Zhuang Yu, Zhao, Ma Guanjing, and Ma Guanhe. There are now eleven people. Uga asked Yoshida if the agent in court did not understand Chinese law, could he entrust a Chinese lawyer? Judge Ding replied that he could, but Dongtuo must entrust a lawyer, and the agent cannot entrust a lawyer again. He also asked Yoshida if the original loan was brought. He replied that it had been brought and should be taken out. Next, Judge Ding asked Zhao Li's agent, Li Wenxuan, if Zhao had signed the loan contract and knew about it? Li Wenxuan replied that Zhao told me that he did not know about the signing. He also asked Zhuang Yu's agent, Xu Xiangkun, if Zhuang had signed the contract and knew about it? Xu Xiangkun replied that Zhuang did not know about it because Zhuang went to Tianjin in the ninth year of the Republic of China and only returned to Jinan in the fifteenth year. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to First Abolish the Regular Customs in Various Places</h3>
<p>And Request Postponement of Issuance of Jiangsu Construction Public Bonds</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xuzhou Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, requesting that before the implementation of the business tax, the regular customs and various special tax bureaus in various places should be abolished along with the lijin, and after the lijin is abolished, no disguised inspection agencies should be established to avoid harming merchants. Also, Xuzhou is in a military area, and the merchants and people cannot bear the burden. Please postpone the issuance of the Xuyi Construction Public Bonds. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce all know that the central government has created a business tax, abolished lijin, reduced the burden on merchants and people, and adhered to the Premier's legacy law. The law is perfect. Jiangsu Province has increased the burden on merchants and people by conducting business registration before the abolition of lijin is actually implemented. As a result, merchants and people in various places have requested postponement of the abolition of lijin. The fact that the implementation of the business registration has been suspended shows that you cherish our people. The inland regular customs are similar in nature to lijin. They should also be abolished before the implementation of the business tax, which is in line with the original intention of abolishing lijin. The various special tax bureaus abstracted from lijin goods should also be abolished along with the lijin. It is also hoped that no disguised inspection agencies will be established after the implementation of the business tax to avoid the pain of using public resources to demand bribes and harming merchants. If this is the case, the domestic goods of our country will be free from the burden of lijin, and those who have been unable to advance due to lack of legs will now flow smoothly throughout the country. This will not only benefit merchants and people, but also promote domestic goods. We hereby telegraph this respectfully and hope that you will review and approve it. We are waiting for your order with great anticipation and gratitude. All members of the Xuzhou Tongshan Chamber of Commerce bow down together. (2) To the National Government of Nanjing, we believe that the issuance of construction public bonds and the implementation of construction affairs in Jiangsu Province is a major event during the tutelage period. We, the people of Tong, should enthusiastically subscribe to fulfill our responsibility as citizens. However, in recent years, military affairs have repeatedly occurred, and Tongshan has been in the middle of the conflict. The people of Tong have not only suffered from the ravages of war, but also the impact of military affairs has made commerce even more depressed. The number of shops that have closed down is innumerable. Fortunately, Chairman Jiang has dispatched his troops effectively, and the armed comrades have bowed their heads to obey orders. Therefore, Yan Feng and the rebellious traitors have been brought to justice. The people of Tong are celebrating that they can finally rest. The tariff treasury bills will also be held one after another. The people of Tong are suffering from not being able to bear the burden. Jiangsu Province is also issuing construction public bonds. Upon hearing this, we are extremely frightened. We respectfully request the government to take into account the situation below and instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department to postpone the issuance of construction public bonds for Tongshan so that the crucian carp in distress can be slightly relieved. Then we will be grateful without limit. The telegraph is urgent and we are waiting for your order with great fear. The Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations bow down.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Holds Conscription to Build Roads</h3>
<p>Provincial and County Roads Start Construction at the Same Time</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Xuzhou is well-connected in all directions, and provincial and county roads meet in Xuzhou. In addition to the original eight branches of main roads, the provincial roads passing through Xuzhou, recently stipulated by the province, are Guayu Road (from Guazhou to Yutai in Lu), Xusu Road (from Xuzhou to S宿zhou in Wan), and Xuhai Road (from Xuzhou to Haizhou). The county road Xuxiaopei Road is also to be built. The old eight branches of highways should also be repaired. Therefore, the implementation of conscription to build roads has been completed by the Construction Bureau Chief Zhu Zhengxue. County Chief Yang Wei ordered the section chiefs to conscript workers. A groundbreaking ceremony was held at Zhengji at noon on the 19th. Representatives from various agencies went to participate. Zhengji is fifty miles away from the city and is transported by car back and forth. Yang Wei reported the significance of conscription to build roads. Zhu Zhixue reported the preparations. After the province approved the plan in September, the first step was measurement, the second step was budget, and the third step was construction. Conscription is only for building roadbeds and bridges. The Construction Bureau plans to equip the roads. The segmentation and length of each road are as follows: The Tongfeng section of Guayu Road is 50 kilometers long and is divided into four sections for construction. The Tong section of Guayu Road is 53 kilometers long and is divided into three sections for construction. The Tongxiao section of Xusu Road is 17.7 kilometers long and is divided into two sections for construction. The Xuyi section of Xuhai Road is 53 kilometers long and is divided into four sections for construction. The Xuxiaopei Road is 75.6 kilometers long and is divided into three sections for construction. The land along the way will be guided and repaired by the section chiefs assigned by the district chiefs. In addition, the old county roads will be repaired at any time through various places. It is estimated that it will take eight months to complete. (20th)</p>
<h3>Four Tao Road Robbery Case, Police Officers Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: At about 5:00 pm on the 9th of this month, the second passenger train on the Fourth Tao Road from Taonan to Siping Street was robbed by bandits at the junction of Lishu County and the Shanzuizi area north of Chuanjiatun Station. It was found that the bandits had first tied up all the road workers in the workshop and searched them. They also took out the tools for repairing the railway and demolished a section of the railway tracks. Some bandits pretended to be passengers and ambushed in the passenger car. When the train traveled to the area and derailed, the bandits responded from inside and outside, causing the robbery. It was reported that the train carried a transfer officer from the Taonan Jiaotong Bank with 10,000 yuan and thousands of yuan in public funds transferred by the railway bureau. The bandits seemed to have detected the details in advance, so they first robbed the large sum of money after getting on the train. As for the passengers in the third-class carriage, the bandits did not have time to search their luggage and parcels in detail, so there were few robberies. There were more than 200 passengers on the train, including one Westerner and three Japanese. In addition, eight railway police officers escorting the train were robbed of their firearms. One railway police officer was injured and has unfortunately died. It was fortunate that no one was kidnapped. After the incident, a passenger ran to the Sanjiangkou Station to report everything. The station immediately reported to the relevant parties by telephone. Jin County Chief of Liaoyuan County Government immediately led the Public Security Team to rush to the rescue and requested the Sixth Regiment of the garrison to send a company of soldiers and the Cavalry Guard Battalion to send a company of soldiers by train. The railway also sent 40 railway police officers from Siping Street to the rescue. However, when the police arrived, the bandits had already fled. County Chief Jin ordered the Public Security Team to protect the passengers and sent a cavalry team to pursue them. He also telegraphed the Provincial Government and ordered the 54th Squadron of the Public Security Force stationed in Qikeshu in the Fourth District to pursue them. However, the bandits seemed to have fled to the Boqi area in the west, so they were not found. Bao County Chief of Lishu County reported to the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government that there were only 30 bandits, while the Railway Bureau said that there were about 100 bandits, all carrying guns. It is now reported that the authorities believe that this action of the bandits must have been organized in advance. The local police team was completely unaware and was negligent in prevention on weekdays. In addition to strictly ordering the garrisons and police teams in the nearby counties to track down and suppress this group of bandits, the police officers in charge will be severely punished as a warning to those who neglect their duties.

<h3>Japanese News Agency Harbin Reporter Spreads Rumors</h3>
<p>The Situation Has Become Serious</p>
<p>Japanese Reporters Defend Spreading Rumors</p>
<p>Our Side Will File a Protest</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Binjiang Third Prison specially invited Zang Benyingming, the secretary of the Japanese Consulate, and Ben Qiaoshu, a special correspondent from the Japanese Telegraphic Communication Agency stationed in Harbin, to the prison on the 10th of this month to apologize and issue a correction because Ben Qiao sent a telegram falsely claiming that prisoners had been abused to death. Unexpectedly, a newspaper run by some Japanese ruffians in Harbin thought that Japan had yielded too much and damaged the authority of the rumor-mongering reporter of its empire. They forced Ben Qiao not to admit that he had apologized and made a correction. The Japanese newspaper also expanded its propaganda, saying that it would announce the prison's abuse and killing of prisoners at the Pan-Pacific Conference and the League of Nations. The prison side is also preparing to protest this matter, which has now become serious. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ben Qiaoshou's Apology Process: On the 10th, the Third Prison invited Chinese reporters and Japanese Consulate officials to visit. After the visit, the prison made four requests to the Japanese Consulate official, Zang Benyingming. Zang Ben replied that he had no right to answer and promised to reply on the 11th. At 10:00 am on the 11th, the Third Prison received a call from Zang Ben, saying that he would go to the prison with the telegraphic reporter Ben Qiaoshou at noon to apologize and discuss a satisfactory solution. At 11:40 am, Zang Ben and Ben Qiao rode in the Japanese Consulate's No. 120 car to the prison to meet with Shan Zuoshan, the warden of the Third Prison. After Zang Ben translated, Ben Qiao apologized, saying that he had not been able to come to inquire when the news broke, causing the rumors to be untrue. He sincerely hoped to issue a correction telegram to avoid expanding the problem. At that time, he seemed to be overwhelmed with shame. He then drafted a correction telegram, the original text of which is as follows: (The previous report that 60 prisoners in the Jilin Third Prison were on strike in the same prison and that one of the leaders was frozen to death, etc., has been visited by the authorities and investigated from all sides, and there is no such thing. The previous news was absolutely wrong. Japanese Telegraphic Communication Agency, Harbin Special Telegram, December 11) After the telegram was drafted, Shan invited Ben Qiao and Zang Ben to visit each prison number to explore the truth. Ben Qiao himself said that the previous transmission was a misunderstanding and there was no need to visit again. He knew that there was definitely nothing wrong. The two only left at 2:00 pm. Shan thought that although he had not achieved the purpose of the four requests, it was okay to end the matter like this, so he did not ask for more.</p>
<p>Japanese Secretary Suddenly Sends Two Letters: On the 12th, the Harbin Daily revealed the resolution process of this case. Japanese reporters generally believed that Ben Qiao and Zang Ben were too weak in handling the matter and should not be so kind to the Chinese. At the same time, they encouraged Ragi, the Japanese Consul, to deny that Zang Ben had been sent as a representative to apologize as reported by the Chinese newspapers. Therefore, Zang Ben visited Shan Zuoshan on the morning of the 13th, asking him to correct the section in the Chinese newspapers about his apology as a representative of the consul. Because Shan was not in the office, he left a letter. Later, because Shan did not reply, he sent another letter on the 15th and another paper to various Chinese newspapers on the 16th, requesting correction. One of the two letters to Shan is recorded as follows: (Recently, I read the newspapers of your country in this port on the 12th, which contained much that was inconsistent with the facts about Mr. Ben Qiao, a special correspondent from the Japanese Telegraphic Communication, visiting Your Prison on the 11th. Because the records have a great impact on my younger brother, I originally went to Your Prison alone and visited with Mr. Ben Qiao entirely out of personal friendship. On the 11th, Mr. Ben Qiao originally went alone, but because of the inconvenience in language and the relationship between my younger brother and you, I mediated to provide various conveniences. I did not formally represent Consul General Ragi or the consulate to apologize. Mr. Ben Qiao has kindly sent a telegram according to the situation. The content has been approved by you. I think I need to study more and spend more time. I am afraid that I will not be able to do it and will not live up to your trust. I still hope that you will make a decision on how to handle it and show me the reply.)</p>
<p>Japanese Reporters Issue Declaration: The background of Zang Ben's two letters was that the Japanese reporters' words did not take effect. The Japanese reporters held a meeting on the 15th and issued a declaration fabricating some facts, strongly pointing out that the prison had indeed abused and killed prisoners. Their declaration and the intention of the League of Nations and various related institutions and organizations around the world's ambassadors stationed in China were to expand the news of spreading rumors, undermine our country's recovery of extraterritorial jurisdiction, and insult our country's judicial dignity. They also demanded that the Japanese consul protest to our country against the Chinese newspapers in Harbin that published the news of Ben Qiao's apology, vainly attempting to use the official order to correct it. They especially demanded that the International Cooperation News Agency correct the correction position to be the size of the social commentary position. At noon on the 16th, Ragi, the Japanese leader, visited our country's negotiator Zhong Yu again and sent a declaration of the Japanese reporters, indicating that it was not necessary to interfere in the dispute between the two sides of the news industry, and it would be okay to continue like this.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>News Summary</p>
<p>Zhong did not give a clear answer, probably because he was afraid that if we did not protest, the Japanese reporters would really spread the declaration to the world and people would mistakenly believe that we acquiesced in the truth. Therefore, negotiator Zhong decided to file a protest after the prison sent the materials. The prison plans to ask the negotiator to protest on the one hand and report to the Judicial and Administrative Yuan to directly negotiate with the Japanese ambassador on the other hand. It has adopted the principle of not giving up easily on this matter. The Harbin Newspaper Association believes that the Harbin Japanese newspapers insulted all of our news industry and decided to hold a meeting on the 18th to discuss the main countermeasures.

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Huangjiafen Bandit Robbery Case: More than ten bandits suddenly came to Huangjiafen, about half a li outside the north gate of this city, in the middle of the night the other day and broke into Huang's house to rob. They robbed more than ten dan of brown rice, silver, clothes, etc., causing losses of several hundred yuan. After the robbery, they loaded Huang's boat to capacity and sailed it to Maohejing, about three li away from the city, before putting the rice and scattered items on the bandit boat and sailing away. The Huang family's boat was abandoned in the Maohejing River and was retrieved by the owner the next day.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>In order to redress a wrong, an inquest was requested regarding the communal bandit riot that occurred near Fengjing in the winter of the 16th year [of the Republic], which resulted in the tragic slaughter, arson, and general panic; the resident army, led by Commander Zhao, severely suppressed the riot, capturing numerous bandits, who were all punished according to the law. However, Yuan Shizhao, who was in charge of this operation, was consistently identified by the captured bandits as having escaped without a trace, which was a source of regret for the people of Fengjing. Later, Yuan was apprehended during activities outside the area and escorted to the Suzhou Higher Court for interrogation. When this became known to the various groups in Fengjing, they immediately gathered evidence and jointly telegraphed the Higher Court to request an investigation. A local villager named Li Fuqin also went to Suzhou to file a case and provide evidence because his father, Quan, had been brutally murdered by Yuan. Now, upon seeing the report that Yuan and others had been escorted to the Suzhou Provincial Military Law Joint Trial Office for trial, and fearing that they would use cunning to deny their guilt, he has specially submitted a petition to the county government, requesting that it be forwarded to the province, strongly requesting to appear in court to provide evidence in order to avenge his father's wrongful death and eliminate the evildoers. It is reported that County Magistrate Jin has agreed to forward the petition according to the situation.</p>
<p>A Cooperative Guidance Institute is being organized. The Department of Agriculture and Mines has appointed a cooperative business instructor to come to Songjiang and establish an office attached to the county government to provide guidance. This has been ongoing for several months. Now, the Department of Agriculture has also dispatched instructor Jiang Zhaogang to Songjiang to organize and guide the institute in order to develop cooperative businesses. Everything is currently being planned, and the institute is expected to be established in January of the 20th year [of the Republic].</p>
<p>Change of District Head in the Eleventh District. Chen Zhankui, the former head of the Eleventh District (Fengjing), was removed from his position because he was leading the security force to search for and suppress bandits when the area was unstable, and he had not yet been promoted to the provincial training. Xu Yunyao has now been selected by the county government and approved by the province to succeed him. The handover has been completed, and he has taken office.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery at Yuanjia Village, Chen Tomb. At 1 AM yesterday morning (the 22nd), a group of over thirty lake bandits suddenly arrived at Yuanjia Village, Chen Tomb, in six or seven boats. They landed and robbed more than twenty farming families, taking the loot onto their boats and heading towards Dian Shan Lake.</p>
<p>Joint Suppression of Lake Bandits by Jiangsu and Zhejiang Water Police. Following the defeat of a gang of bandits by the Suzhou-Wuxi Water Police, bandits were spotted in the areas of Mingwan, West Mountain of Dongting, and Wu County. It is now reported that these two gangs of lake bandits have fled to Zhili in Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, led by bandit leader Wu Huaizhen. In addition to requesting the Wuxing County government to dispatch the Public Security Bureau's patrol brigade to pursue and suppress the bandits, Luo, the chief of the town's Public Security Sub-bureau, has also coordinated with the 4th and 8th companies of the 2nd Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Forces to jointly suppress them. Furthermore, the 3rd District of the Nanxun Water Police has also sent a letter to the 2nd and 3rd Districts of the Suzhou-Wuxi Water Police, requesting them to dispatch teams to intercept the bandits.</p>
<p>A threatening letter scares Han Hefeng to death. Han Hefeng, a 55-year-old resident of No. 251 Pishi Street, father of Ms. Han Su'ying, suddenly received a threatening letter from the post office on the 25th of last month, demanding 500 yuan and setting a six-day deadline for payment. The letter threatened to use cruel methods if the demand was ignored. After receiving the letter, Han Hefeng was filled with fear, lost sleep and appetite, and suddenly collapsed and suffered a stroke on the 30th of this month, dying on the same day. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 21st of this month, the Han family suddenly received a second threatening letter, stating that "the first act of tragedy has ended. If you still do not fulfill the conditions of the previous letter, the second act of tragedy will continue to occur." The Han family felt helpless and reported the matter to the First Sub-bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>A pair of mandarin ducks tragically killed. Ma Shui’fa, a villager in the 56th tu of the 19th du of Weiting Township, married a woman surnamed Zhu several years ago. After their marriage, the couple had a very good relationship. Ma worked as a weaver, but recently, the weaving industry declined sharply, and his income could not cover his expenses. Forced by livelihood, Ma came to the city to seek a living. After her husband left, Zhu, unable to bear the loneliness of sleeping alone, committed adultery with Zhu Jinsheng from the same village. Ma lived far away in the city, and news was slow to reach him. In June and July of this year, Shi Baosheng, Wang Fuchang, Zhu Linquan, and others discovered the affair between Zhu Jinsheng and Zhu, and extorted five yuan from the Song family. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 20th) at 9 AM, Zhu Jinsheng went to Zhu's house again for adultery. Shi Baosheng and others learned of this and went to Zhu's house with Wang Fuchang, Zhu Linquan, and others to catch them in the act. At that time, Zhu Jinsheng and Zhu heard the commotion and climbed out of bed naked, rushing out of the door to escape. In their haste, they fell into the river and drowned. Shi Baosheng and others, seeing that they had caused a disaster, fled together. By the next morning, neighbors spotted the floating corpses in the river and reported the incident to the 11th Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau through the village head, Zhou Huilian. The Public Security Bureau immediately reported the incident to the local court yesterday, requesting that officials be dispatched to the countryside for an examination. The prosecutor's office immediately dispatched officials to supervise the examination according to the law after receiving the report. It is also heard that Zhu was six months pregnant.</p>
<p>Her tragic death is indeed lamentable.</p>
<p>National Products Exhibition Scheduled. The Suzhou National Products Relief Association has invited the Shanghai National Products Maintenance Association and the Factory Federation to hold a National Products Promotion Exhibition in Suzhou.

The Suzhou Relief Association has received a telegram from Shanghai stating that all products from various factories in Shanghai will be shipped to Suzhou today (the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Pawnbrokers' Representatives Conference held in Wuxi. The pawnbroking industries in Wuxi, Dongtai, Wujiang, and other counties received the new Jiangsu Provincial Pawnbroking Regulations, Article 16, from the Provincial Pawnbrokers' Association. The article stated that if the redemption of pawned items is delayed by more than five days, half a month's interest will be reduced, and if it is delayed by more than fifteen days, one month's interest will be reduced, starting on January 1st of the 20th year [of the Republic]. The pawn industries in various counties successively petitioned the province for a solution, but no action was taken. Therefore, they initiated the convocation of a Jiangsu Provincial Pawnbrokers' Representatives Conference to discuss a settlement method. The conference location was decided to be the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday was the date of the conference, and over one hundred and twenty representatives from various counties attended. The conference began at 2 PM. Qin Zhuoru and Qian Sunqing, representatives from Wuxi, and Cao Decheng, a representative from Taixing, were publicly elected as temporary chairmen. The chairman first reported the purpose of the conference, and then the discussion began on the proposal to reduce half the interest starting on January 1st of next year. It was resolved to submit a petition to the Provincial Government's Department of Construction, pleading for consideration of the difficulties of the businesses and requesting that Article 16 of the newly promulgated Jiangsu Provincial Pawnbroking Regulations be temporarily suspended in order to maintain business operations. It was also resolved to organize a Jiangsu Provincial Pawnbrokers' Temporary Joint Office to handle this case. The office will be temporarily located in Wuxi. For counties that have not sent representatives to attend, the pawnbrokers will communicate separately. The expenses of the Joint Office will be five yuan per pawnbroking establishment. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>A Prominent Figure from the Legal Community Visits Wuxi. Lin Biao, President of the Jiangsu Higher Court, was drawn by the beautiful scenery of our city. Yesterday, he traveled by car from Suzhou to Wuxi, accompanied by Huang Yunchen, the County Magistrate of Wuxian, Wen Bingzhong, the former Superintendent of the Suzhou Customs, Zhong Ziyuan, the former Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, and others. After getting off the car, the local resident Tang Xinghai hired Xie's painted boat and sailed to Taihu Lake to visit the famous scenic spots such as Meiyuan and Yuantouzhu. It was drizzling, but President Lin and others were very enthusiastic about their visit. They returned to the city at 5 PM and drove back to Suzhou at 6 PM.</p>
<p>Measures to Remedy Local Finances. The county government previously received an order from the Department of Finance to remit the entire amount of five jiao per two yuan of the winter grain tribute surcharge to the provincial treasury. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Pan believed that the five jiao retained by the county was intended for local autonomy funds, but after the entire amount was remitted to the province, local finances would be greatly affected, and local projects could not be sustained. Therefore, he proposed three remedial measures and submitted them to the Department of Finance for approval. Later, the Department of Finance rejected the measures and ordered him to devise other remedial methods. County Magistrate Pan now plans to levy an additional one fen per yuan of the tax on field and house pawn purchases as an autonomy fee to make up the deficit. It is estimated that the income from this tax can reach 800,000 yuan annually. If an additional one fen is levied, 8,000 yuan can be obtained annually. Yesterday, County Magistrate Pan prepared a document and submitted it to the Department of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Zhou Shuiping Case. The Zhou Shuiping case, which had been pending for a long time, was resolved. Last month, the perpetrators of the Zhou case, Zhang Chongzhi and others, returned to the village. The county party headquarters reported them to the county for arrest, but they escaped again. It is now known that this case has been resolved through thirteen party-government talks. (1) In order to expedite the conclusion of this case, Sha Bingyuan and 38 others were tasked with contributing 2,000 yuan each, and 50,000 yuan was designated as a fund for the Zhou Shuiping Memorial Elementary School, with the remaining 26,000 yuan used for tomb repair and compensation. (2) After this disposition of the case, all those who participated in accusing Zhou will be exempt from arrest, and their seized property will be unsealed, and all those who were detained will be granted bail. This case has been approved by the 75th resolution of the Provincial Reorganization Committee, and the Jiangyin County Party Reorganization Committee has been instructed to comply. The long-pending Zhou case has thus been resolved.</p>

Lu Tingbao and others from the same village, eager to become officials, were also swindled of hundreds of yuan. Bao Hanwen was reported by Ma Yuncheng in Jingjiang. Bao confessed that he was 29 years old, worked as a teacher in a private elementary school in Zhenjiang, and that Chen Xiujun had studied English with him, so his sister asked him to help and guaranteed his room and board.

<h3>Vice Ministers Li and Chen of the Ministry of Education Arrived at the Ministry Yesterday to Take Office</h3>
<p>Li Shuhua advocates actively correcting the psychology of young people and rectifying academic conduct.</p>
<p>Chen Bulei hopes that ministry staff will provide more guidance so that work will be more effective.</p>
<p>Staff changes have already been announced; farewell dinner for Vice Ministers Liu and Zhu last night.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday, the newly appointed Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Education, Li Shuhua and Chen Bulei, arrived at the Ministry to take office. It coincided with the Ministry's memorial week, and they were led by former Vice Minister Liu Dabai to participate in the ceremony, with Liu still presiding.</p>
<h3>Liu Dabai's Report</h3>
<p>Liu reported that Vice Ministers Li and Chen arrived at the Ministry today to take office. Vice Minister Li previously managed educational administration in Beiping, and Vice Minister Chen recently oversaw educational administration in Zhejiang Province, both with remarkable achievements. It is extremely fortunate that Chairman Chiang, who also served as the Minister, has been ordered to transfer them to the Ministry. When the Ministry staff bid farewell to former Minister Chiang, Minister Chiang told his colleagues that although the Minister of Education has changed, the policy of the revolutionary government's Ministry of Education and the internal organization law will not change with the change of leadership. He also quoted a certain foreign newspaper's editor-in-chief who changed his post, but the newspaper's advocacy and employment of personnel were not affected by it. He said that from now on, under the leadership of Minister Chiang, who also serves as the Minister, and Vice Ministers Li and Chen, it is inevitable that the educational administration will be more effective. Chen finished his speech and introduced Li Shuhua to speak.</p>
<h3>Li Shuhua's Speech</h3>
<p>Li said that China has been running education for decades, but the effectiveness has not been significant. The number of illiterate people still accounts for the majority. In higher education, students studying abroad and university graduates have still not been able to make enough efforts for the society. There are often things in society that cannot be done by the right people. Recently, the general young people have been lured by reactionary thoughts, leading to distorted thinking and out-of-line actions. The university is in chaos, that is, the middle school students' writing is not fluent, and the basic knowledge is not sufficient, and there are often student tides. It is the most worrying thing for the future of the party and the country. Recently, the Executive Yuan has ordered the rectification of the national academic style, and Chairman Chiang has also published a book admonishing students across the country. The Ministry of Education should follow the orders of the Executive Yuan and Chairman Chiang's proposal to admonish students to actively correct the psychology of young people across the country and rectify the academic style to put it on the right track. Many of you have served in the Ministry of Education for a long time and have specialized knowledge. The country's administrative employment of people is based on talent as the standard. We must all be at ease in our work. At the end,</p>

This time, he was suddenly ordered to transfer to the Ministry of Education. He thought that Premier Sun's will had said that individuals have no freedom, so he had to follow Chairman Chiang's instructions and Vice Minister Li's leadership to try to do the job. Some of you are old friends, and some of you have also learned a lot during the National Education Conference. Moreover, education is the most important cause of nation-building. All things only need to be done with enthusiasm, and there is nothing that cannot be achieved. He hopes that you will give him more guidance so that the cause of educational administration will be more effective.</p>

<p>Shanghai College 52 vs. 20 Win Friendship (Group B2)</p>
<p>Labor University 28 vs. 20 Win Qing Guang (Group A)</p>
<p>The Western Qing Basketball Association held three group matches last night. Qing Guang's defeat to Labor University in Group A was unexpected. Qing Guang's performance lacked coordination, and the main player Tan Dahua seemed discouraged. As a result, their skills could not be improved. The results were: (1) Xia Guang defeated Rowing 19 to 16; (2) Shanghai College defeated Friendship 55 to 20; (3) Labor University defeated Qing Guang 28 to 20.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter Seafarer</h3>
<p>Wife: I have to prepare dinner myself tonight.</p>
<p>Husband: Why? Where did the cook go?</p>
<p>Wife: I don't know. She suddenly resigned this afternoon, without expressing any dissatisfaction beforehand.</p>
<p>Husband: Oh, I remember. She did express something to me. When I left home this morning, she said to me, "Young master, bring back some digestive pills tonight." That was her way of indicating that she was about to quit and you would be preparing dinner.</p>
<p>Girl (very earnestly to her lover): Marriage is really impossible because there are too many obstacles. I need you to forgive me for this.</p>
<p>Boy: My disappointment has reached its extreme.</p>
<p>Girl: Don't be disappointed. We can be like siblings. I'll be your little sister, okay?</p>
<p>Boy (after thinking for a moment): That's good too. There can be no restraint between siblings. I'm the big brother, you're the little sister. Tonight, you can sleep with big brother.</p>
<p>Old Lady (asking the captain on the ship): Captain, why is our ship sailing so slowly today?</p>
<p>Captain's Wife: It's because of the bad weather. Don't you see the heavy fog? It's very inconvenient to proceed.</p>
<p>Old Lady: But look, the sky above is very clear.</p>
<p>Captain's Wife: Unfortunately, our ship is not sailing up there, unless the boiler explodes.</p>
<h3>Record of the Establishment of the Women's Association for the Promotion of National Products Sun Choucheng</h3>
<p>The Women's Association for the Promotion of National Products, initiated by prominent women in this city, held its founding meeting on the 20th of this month at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. I also went with my wife that day to see and hear what was happening. Since my observations were rather accurate, I will record the details that the newspapers did not cover. I believe this will be welcome news to those who love national products.</p>
<p>The venue that day was the regular meeting room on the third floor. A red silk banner with gold letters reading "Founding Meeting of the Shanghai Women's Association for the Promotion of National Products" was hung. Next to it were plaques presented by three national product organizations. The Shanghai National Products Factory Association presented a plaque with the four characters "Striving Together." The Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products and the China National Products Maintenance Association presented two phrases, "Leaders in Practicing National Products Use Among Women" and "The Vanguard of National Salvation," respectively. The seating was arranged in a format of one horizontal row and four vertical rows, covered with white tablecloths. Tea and refreshments were provided by Guanshengyuan. Each person's seat had printed materials such as the association's origins, declaration, and membership oath. All propaganda slogans promoting national products were made of enamel. The walls were covered with artistic pictures and slogans. Next to the image of Dr. Sun Yat-sen were pasted two sheets of paper, one with the meeting agenda and the other with the oath of the committee members. The receptionists wore light blue satin ribbons and were dressed in national silk cheongsams. The signature books were divided into two types: one for guests and one for members. The names signed in the member book were all elegant and tidy, with no exceptions. In the guest book, there was still one name written in a cursive style that occupied two or three spaces, demonstrating that women are more meticulous than men. I arrived at half past two. The first to arrive were all in the reception room, where the scent of perfume and elegant hairstyles created a scene that had never been seen at previous meetings of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Pan Gongzhan asked if Madam Yan E'sheng had arrived. Yan said she was getting an air injection at the hospital, which made those who heard him burst into laughter. When Wang Xiaolai arrived, he asked why the meeting hadn't started yet. Wang Yansong jokingly said to him, "Because we borrowed the Chamber of Commerce for the meeting, and we didn't dare to start before the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce arrived." When taking seats, the five minutes that it took for the recommended master of ceremonies to stand straight at the entrance took a long time. The military band was a gift from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, totaling twenty-six people. The music was played on the balcony, which was more than two zhang away from where the master of ceremonies was standing. The women's voices were soft, so the military band didn't hear the first call to play the music. Wang Xiaolai had to relay the message in a loud voice. The singing of the party song was like a singing lesson in a girls' school, clear and melodious, which was not present in other meetings. In terms of gender, men accounted for only one-sixth of those present. In terms of clothing, most of the men wore robes, while the women all wore cheongsams. Among the women, only one had her hair in a bun, while the rest all had short hair. Those wearing glasses accounted for about two-tenths of the attendees. When the chairman reported on the preparations, he listed the names of those who had contributed, always connecting the names of "Madam So-and-So" and "Ms. So-and-So." For those who were not yet married, he only reported their names. Zhu Yakui, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, sat next to me. In his speech, he emphasized two key points: "Setting an example and never changing" and "Working hard to publicize so that everyone knows." When Mayor Zhang gave his speech, he said that he was appointed as a consultant by the association. He had come to the meeting today to prepare to advise and question. Director Pan said in his speech that China is not unique to men and women should share the responsibility of saving China. He compared it to carrying a load on a pole, saying that only when the weight is evenly balanced on both ends can the load be carried away. Ye Huijun's speech called the women's world Kunfang and the men's world Qianfang. He said that in the past, only Qianfang was in charge of promoting national products, but now that Kunfang has also formed an organization, the future is limitless. He also described in detail the good feng shui of Shanghai, calculating that a certain gentleman spoke of Kunfang twenty-four times and Qianfang eighteen times, which can be said to be a great talk about Qian and Kun. Mayor Zhang, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and others sat next to him and watched this stiff face and listened to the humorous speech. They all laughed uncontrollably. The women all listened attentively and clapped their hands in approval. Wang Xiaolai said that women are the heads of families and that it is up to women to decide whether to buy national products for daily use. Therefore, the promotion of national products should be initiated by women, which will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Wang Yansong compared the establishment of the association to the birth of a child and hoped that it would be well-cared for so that it can grow up and serve the society. Shu Huizhen said that women have always been behind in doing things. Now that the association has been established, they should work hard to wash away old habits, bravely move forward, and win glory for women. San Jie Anxiang recounted her experience of promoting national products in Beijing, urging people door-to-door. There were many couples who went together that day. The husband gave the speech and the wife applauded, which can be said to be practicing the four characters of "husband sings and wife follows." When electing the executive and supervisory committee members, in order to save time, one person recommended and everyone approved the candidates. Dozens of jade arms were raised at the same time, which was a beautiful sight to behold. The recommendation voices were gentle and moving. By the time the meeting adjourned, the clock struck five.</p>
<h3>A Brief Record of the Banquet in Weitang Wang Cen</h3>
<p>Zhang Shanzi and Daqian's mother celebrated her seventieth birthday at Daqian's residence in Weitang. Many colleagues from Shanghai went to celebrate. The mother was a skilled painter and a believer in religion. She did not need a cane and her legs and feet were healthy. She had five sons and seventeen grandchildren, most of whom were proficient in literature and art and were well-known at the time. Her great-grandson Zhaoji was born on the seventieth day of the year. Yellow birds sang in the garden, and fragrant orchids surrounded the steps. The walls were covered with paintings and calligraphy, all the works of famous Shanghai artists. Paintings included Yiting's plum blossoms, Binhong's blessed land, Wuchang's Yueding Ci Yun, Hongwei's chrysanthemums and birds, Manqing's cypress lion, Xin Hu's landscape, and Zhan Zhi's Haiwu Tianchou, all of which were excellent works of the time. Ge Yi's painting was particularly magnificent, with a paper that was over one zhang long and strong. My own small landscape painting, which was less than two feet in size, was also unconventional. I have always been unable to paint and have repeatedly violated the wishes of Shanzi and Daqian. I initially painted a long scroll of pine and orchids, with the orchids actually added by Hu Tinglu of Wuxi. Shanzi immediately praised them, saying that someone knew his hero like the one who touches up paintings by the bedside. Later, I created a small landscape painting, gathering the usual writing styles of Wuchang, Daqian, and Manqing, which was disorganized and chaotic, and did not resemble a painting. How dare I show such a foolish thing to anyone? However, the old lady smiled. There were many elegant couplets that could be recited. Qiangcun Shiyue said, "Xuanwen Jiangwei, female ancestor's model, Xi Mu's green hair, long life expected." Su Kanxiansheng said, "Walking with integrity and living in peace, the sun is long and bright, good plans give birth to blessings, Qilinzi Fenghu." Zhu Zhenchang Shiyue said, "Jizhang's great year, Ci Yun's good shade, honorable vessels and blessings, paintings and trees, long spring." Pan Lanshi Xianyang said, "Ci Bamboo's long spring, green, opening the painting curtain, Lingmei's first release, red spots coming on clothes." Xie Wuliang Xianyang said, "Ci Yun in the sea has many blessings and longevity, the famous paintings of Yizhou are difficult for brothers." Qian Zhenduo Xianyang said, "Longevity is like Song Qiao's banquet, happiness and joy, protecting my gold and jade brightness." Jianxiang Luo Geng Xiong said, "The old man in the South Building ties the sun with a long rope, the young master of the West Garden's strong brush soars the clouds." Wang Lipei Xianyang said, "The talents of the three Shu are compared, one door soars to the sky."</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (108)</h3>
<p>Entering the cities of Burma, I saw that most of those who held the counters and managed the money were women. Many of them were single and did not want to cooperate with men, so they operated their own businesses for life. This is because males are inconstant and often have bad habits, which can affect their families, such as smoking and gambling. Therefore, if female intelligence develops, the selection of men becomes stricter, and unworthy men are eliminated and cannot pass on their genes. This is also Darwin's example of female elimination of males. However, the relationship between females and society is by no means only within the confines of the question. How can people only know Marx and forget Darwin? Marx focuses on the material history to explain social change, while Darwin focuses on sex to explain social aberrations. The value is the same, but instead of using Marx's example to explain from the outside, it is better to use Darwin's example to explain from the inside. A recent example is that after the development of female intelligence, morality, and power, inferior males must be eliminated and unable to pass on their genes. This is also acknowledged by eugenics. In the past, a friend told me that women are almost natural anarchists, so they often avoid cooperation with males and are particularly impatient with males' rascal demands. There are many female teachers in Burmese schools, and recently there was a female doctor who graduated from the UK. The custom of marriage between men and women in Burma often involves escape, that is, when men and women are deeply in love, they suddenly escape together for two weeks or more than a month to show their respect for both families. After this period, they return to the woman's family, apologize, and perform the ceremony. The two families then recognize the marriage.</p>
<p>The two major problems in Burma are monks and women. I used to comment on the problem of life in the Dream of the Red Chamber, which is these two things. The problem of escaping the world is for monks, and the problem of entering the world is for women. Both are not only major problems, but also contain mysterious meanings that are difficult to judge arbitrarily. Therefore, I will record what I know and understand for now.</p>
<p>Qing Ke Cheng Mu Huan Yu Zhu Ruzhen Xianyang said, "Jin Guo's high-age banquet, the sea algae in the hall, Seng Yao's wonderful brush, reflecting the gailandan." Tan Zekai Xianyang said, "Xuan Pavilion's old age, Xia cup benefits longevity, Lan Ermiao's skillful brush, inheriting joy." Both are dignified and practical. Zhang Danfu Xianyang said, "The old lady enjoys Kangning's longevity, the two young masters are famous calligraphers and painters." Qing Lian said, "There are several talented sons in Shu, may the mother see her sons' old age with lasting taste." The language is clever, but it is a pity that the upper couplet is weaker. Gongsun Changzi Xiong said, "Having sons, half of them are famous and talented, it is possible to live a long life. I bow to my mother, I alone am close to this grandson." The old friendship of Zhou is beyond what we can reach. Other couplets from gentlemen such as Wang Bingsan, Yang Xizi, Yu Zhishao, Wei Ruosou, Wang Raosheng, Ma Zonghuo, Zhu Dake, Wang Qiu Mei were extremely good, but it is a pity that they cannot be remembered. After the spring wine was offered, the guests visited the tomb of the Mei Taoist and took a photo, enjoying themselves to the fullest before returning. I record this to ensure that I will never forget it.</p>
<h3>Zhou Lang Listens to Music Talking About Stars Ju Yin</h3>
<p>Southern branches herald the blossoming of plum blossoms on the ridge. When the Wanhua Nan comes, it is just in time. This time, the performances are mostly song and dance dramas. The music lovers of Shanghai are all excited, listening to songs all day long without any sign of fatigue. When I went to listen to the Farewell My Concubine drama the other day, I met my old friend Zhou Jianyun. After a brief greeting, he happily told me about the recent situation of the Star Opera Troupe. The troupe has been established for a year and has rehearsed three times with excellent results. Its reputation has spread throughout Chunjiang. It is all thanks to your leadership. This is what I have long admired and respected. During our conversation, I learned that the fourth rehearsal has been scheduled for January 1st and will continue. The beautiful dances and clear songs are eagerly awaited. The artistic advancement this time is even more impressive than the previous rehearsals. Zhou said that rehearsals in the company are like building a car behind closed doors. In the future, it is planned to hold public performances in theaters or to schedule them once every two months. Talented people are gathered, costumes are fully prepared, and performances can be staged at any time. The special issue of this issue includes works by famous writers such as Yuan Hanyun, Lin Lao Zhuo, Zhang Henshui, and Yu Kongwo, which is quite exciting. As he spoke, he showed me a list of the programs, which I would like to transcribe for your enjoyment.</p>

<h3>European Travel Correspondence (91) Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>Italian Pilgrimage Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (14)</p>
<p>June 4th, St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican, Sistine Chapel</p>
<p>This great St. Peter's Basilica, after the profound and meticulous design of DONATOBRAMANTE, the magnificent and extraordinary imagination of MICHELANGELO, and finally the careful arrangement by BERNINI, was built with domes on both sides and a portico outside the door. He used clever perspective to make people feel that the facade is more magnificent and sublime than it actually is. Even the large square in front of it feels even larger in people's perception because of the surrounding of countless huge stone pillars. Moreover, he used the towering central dome to give the entire building a unified function, so no matter from which aspect we look at it, we always feel that everywhere is (beautiful) and (grand). Only this solemn and grand, strange building can be worthy of being called a symbol of the Renaissance and the Reformation, and it can also be worthy of being said that it is sufficient to represent the cultural type of the Renaissance period.</p>
<p>Inside this great basilica is also treasured a rare treasure of the Renaissance period, which I almost forgot: the statue called LAPIETA, made by Michelangelo when he was twenty-four years old. This statue expresses the Virgin's emotions of pity for the dead body of Christ. This style is completely different from his later masterpieces, such as the statue of Moses or the sculptures on the Medici tomb. This is Michelangelo's early work, the most serene and profound of all his works. Michelangelo's later development was based on this. Its characteristic lies in its ability to profoundly express the Virgin's sorrowful face without losing the dignity and demeanor within it. The depth of its accumulation makes people linger in silence. I, who have no religious beliefs and a strong personality, cannot help but feel subdued under this stone statue. Is this the touching power of religion or the touching power of art?</p>
<p>There are many large buildings here, not just St. Peter's Basilica. On the left, there are many towering buildings that seem to be a barrier to St. Peter's Basilica. This is the world's most famous Vatican Apostolic Palace. I used to often think that if I could wander in the Apostolic Palace, which is a treasure trove of art, I would have gained the glory of the world. Now that I have entered the Papal Palace, the joy I feel is naturally beyond description. This Papal Palace began to be built in the 5th century, and has been expanded ever since until the present day. The lofty and magnificent buildings are lined up in succession, containing museums, the Sistine Chapel, etc., which are unparalleled treasures of the world.</p>

<h3>Gold Bar Financial Market Has Strong Rebound Force</h3>
<p>Many Fluctuations, Rapid Decline Rate, Yesterday, December 22, Gold Bar Turned</p>
<p>Good, the declining trend was very strong, but the changing power was still extremely severe. At times, there were advances and retreats within a few taels. The total fluctuation throughout the day was more than twelve taels, making it extremely difficult to predict. Dealers were hesitant to buy and sell, and there was great confusion. Previous market participants, such as Yuan Mao, Yong Heng, Xing Tai, and Kang Run, all sold. Xin Heng, Tong Tai Chang, and hedgers bought. There was no good or bad news from the overseas silver market the day before. The opening price was high because buyers seemed to be active in the market. Later, it was learned that the United States had loaned a large sum of money to Mexico to save the declining silver market, which caused panic. Various firms tended to sell, and the market situation suddenly weakened, deteriorating rapidly. It fell by more than ten taels in a waterfall-like manner from sixty-four or five taels to fifty-three taels. The foreign exchange listing price remained unchanged, and the domestic market tended to be tight. Speculators and hedgers sold. Around noon, the market situation recovered slightly, pulling up four or five taels. The market winds and waves became more turbulent, and weakness was the main force. Afterwards, it was still weak. Overall, the state was permeated with a chaotic situation that was not easy to grasp. In particular, the Indian exchange rate rose repeatedly, and it was predicted that the big bars should have an upward trend. Finally, it was between fifty-four taels.</p>
<p>The current high market fluctuated wildly. The opening price of the February gold bar in the morning was 664 taels and 8 mace, an increase of 3 taels and 4 mace (gross market 62 taels to 6 taels, then 5 taels, buyers unwilling). The big bar was not changed by private telegrams either. This was because the market should have been bullish last Saturday but failed, so dealers were psychologically bullish. A moment later, Bing Xing, Da De Cheng, Yong Feng, Shun Li, etc. came to sell. Suddenly, it was heard that the United States had a rumor of rescuing the silver price, so people's hearts suddenly turned weak and plummeted six or seven taels, only counting fifty-eight taels. Yong Feng, Xin Heng, and small households came to buy, and then jumped more than four taels, totaling about sixty-two taels. The foreign exchange was flat, and the near-term and far-term British gold was bought by Zhi Jin, etc. at 1.54375. Sumitomo bought US dollars at 35.25. When the shilling was announced, it was one tael and three mace and four cents. Soon after, it fell to sixty taels and five cents. Mitsui sold March US dollars at 35.1875, and then the Dongya, etc. bought March British gold at 1.54375, and then it was sixty-two taels and seven or eight cents. The prices offered by various firms were inconsistent. Later, the sellers prevailed, and Zhi Feng, Yong Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong Heng Xing, and Japanese banks all sold, breaking the sixty-tael mark. The foreign exchange was tight. Sumitomo and Zhi Jin bought this month and March British gold at 1.5 half. Then, the banks did each other at 1.55625. At present, Toyo can only sell at one tael, three mace, nine cents, one-two-five. The market has a tendency to plummet. Until 11:15, it suddenly became fifty-two taels and four cents. Only one or two taels of fluctuation were counted in between. Later, Xin Heng continued to buy, and Yong Feng also dragged away. Dehua and Huayi did each other for April British gold at 1.55625. In just half an hour, it soared five taels, totaling seven taels and four cents. However, small households took this opportunity to sell. Unfortunately, in this turbulent situation, selling meant a small loss. At noon, the market closed back to five taels and seven cents, and then it was suppressed to taels. Zhi Feng Yong, etc. sold. The listed price was still 691 taels and 8 mace, a small reduction of about 30 taels. Later, there was another reduction of ten taels, noon 36 taels.</p>
<p>Compared with the previous drop of seven taels and four. The afternoon market opened at fifty taels and four cents, three. The remaining energy from the afternoon, and it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had increased by ten annas. Then, there were slightly more buyers, totaling four taels and seven or eight cents, then suddenly reduced to fifty-three taels. Later, Yuan Heng, Yuan Cheng, Yong Yu, Da Ju Chang, Tai Kang Run, and hedgers all came to buy. Suddenly, the price advanced. Mitsui bought March British gold at 5625 to 1.5 half. January 1.54375. Then the gold price rose by more than seven taels. At 3:10, it was as high as sixty taels and five cents. After that, the Indian exchange rate increased by two or three annas, and Zhi Feng Yong Cheng, Feng Yong Yu Da Yuan Mao Yong, etc. bravely sold. For a time, a storm arose and the market fell into a slump, plummeting by more than seven taels. At 4:20, it was 53 taels and 1 mace. The market was so chaotic that it was difficult to cope with. At 4:30, the market closed at 54 taels, a decrease of 7 taels and 4 mace compared to last Saturday. It was raised by one tael, totaling five taels, which was replenished by small households and shorts. The maximum price during the day was 64 taels and 8 mace, and the minimum price was 52 taels and 4 mace (referring to the listed price), a difference of 12 taels and 4 mace, which can be said to be huge. The morning market for goods was 64 taels and 9 mace, noon closed at 55 taels, noon 55 taels and 2 mace, the market closed at 54 taels and 3 mace. The listed price was reduced by about 37-38 taels to 32 taels. In the end, it was still reduced by 38 taels, registered at 53 taels to 56 taels, and the water replenishment was 53 taels to 51 taels.</p>
<p>The number of entries and exits was extremely chaotic. Among the transactions between dealers, Yong Feng Da De Cheng Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Cheng, Shun Li, Wan Xing, etc. had erratic entries and exits. Xin Heng Tong Tai Chang both entered two or three thousand strips. Heng Xing Bing Xing sold one thousand several hundred strips. Yuan Mao Yong Tai Kang Run all exited goods from time to time. In the afternoon, Yuan Cheng Yong Shun Li, Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, Heng Xing Xu Chang all entered. Yu Da Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Cheng Feng Yong had inconsistent entries and exits. Tai Kang Run exited and then entered. Yi Feng Yong Yuan Cheng sold at around 60 taels. Yuan Tai Tong Tai Chang had occasional entries and exits. The goods were entered by the Dalian Gang, totaling more than 3,000 strips, and 2,000 strips were sold. The Guang Gang sold one thousand strips in the morning market and chased up several hundred strips in the afternoon market, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Also Shows Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Are Selling Off, Big Bars Are Expected To Rise Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC listing prices for all exchanges did not increase or decrease, as the British and American silver markets were also uneventful the day before. As for the bank's internal market, it was initially flat and then weak. The gold market rose and fell again, plummeting by ten taels. The reason was that the United States had loaned a large sum of money to Mexico to save the silver shortage. As a result, the market atmosphere changed and weakened. The exchanges followed suit. By the time the market closed, British gold had increased by 25, US dollars had increased by 5625, and Japanese gold had decreased by 2.25 compared to last Saturday. Among the Chinese gold businesses, those who tended to sell sold approximately 300,000 pounds of British gold. The bank's buying appetite was still active. Zhengjin, Taiwan, Dongya, WahBi, Sumitomo, and Mitsui all absorbed the gold. The banks did 100,000 pounds of gold with each other. In addition, more than 100,000 US dollars were traded. Chinese merchants entered and exited differently, with a total turnover of 4 to 500,000 yuan. Sumitomo and Mitsui only entered and exited each other on the bank side. Also, the Dalian Gang appeared in the Dalian market with more than 1,000,000 yuan. The Japanese banks absorbed the gold. The market atmosphere was weak. The big bar of silver may be released today.</p>
<p>The internal market for British exchange fluctuated by 25. In the morning, the quoted prices for near and far terms were the same: one shilling, five pence, two-five bid, three-one-two-five. Zhengjin first absorbed 10,000 in March, priced at 4375. Taiwan bought 5,000 in January. Later, Dongya WahBi entered 15,000 in March, priced the same as Zhengjin, and entered 5,000, priced at 1.5 half. Sumitomo bought 5,000 in December, priced the same. China and Shanghai Zhengjin did each other for 20,000 in April, priced at 5625, and also did each other with China-US for 10,000, priced the same. WahBi bought 5,000 in March, priced the same. The noon closing price was 4275 bid, half a pence. In the afternoon, Mitsui Huai entered 20,000 for March and April, priced at 5625. Zhengjin also entered 5,000 in April at the same price.

<h3>Year-End Approaching, Surcharges Are Stagnant</h3>
<p>Market Overview Yesterday, as it was Monday, the bank's collection and settlement seemed more complicated, but the settlement amounts were particularly large. As the year-end approached, it was customary to engage in settlement, which was not surprising. However, the current weakness of both silver and foreign prices is probably unprecedented. The reason is that this year's business is not prosperous, and there is no way to develop silver, which has led to this situation.</p>
<p>Tax rate prices (Foreign Cents) The early market was 7 mace, 2 cents, 4 li, 2 hao, and a half. The noon market was 7 mace, 2 cents, 4 li, and a half. As a result, the market situation was slightly worse than the previous day (Silver Rebate) The early market was 4 points and the noon market was 5 points, slightly better than the previous day by one point. The scratching head is still white, and the bank's listing price has been without a market for a long time.</p>
<p>The subsidiary coin market situation: Jiangnan small ocean early market was still 6 mace 5 points, noon market changed to 2.5 li, which is 6 mace 5 points 2.5 li, and the transaction was made in the early market for 2,000 horns, and the noon market was 3,000 horns. The Guangdong small ocean early market was 6 mace 5 li and the noon market was 6 mace 5 li 6.7 hao. Transactions were made for 110,000 horns in the early market and 45,000 horns in the noon market. Copper coins inexplicably shrank greatly, 6,000 wen was 367,000 wen. The reason is that the spot goods on the market were released and shipped to other ports, resulting in insufficient allocation of circulating chips. The small money shops that specialize in copper coins were also unable to cope with the situation for a while.</p>
<p>Silver Ocean entries and exits (Silver notes) Yesterday, the bank's collection and settlement were larger, with a total of more than 4 million. Chinese merchants collected and settled more than 4.6 million, foreign merchants 2.9 million, deposit settlement more than 1 million, special funds collected and settled more than 2 million, and various goods, exchange taxes and other items collected and settled more than 9 million. Out of the warehouse 1.3 million. The Japanese bank collected and settled various items 4.4 million, settled 2 million, and entered the warehouse 500,000. The money shop Silver Public collected and settled 43 million, scratched the settlement 540,000, and various remittance funds collected and settled 1.7 million, and collected cash tens of thousands (Ocean notes) Remittance bills were traded for 1.25 million in the early market and 900,000 in the noon market. There was no transaction in both banknote markets. Over-the-counter banknotes traded 185,000 in the early market and 65,000 in the noon market. Bank transactions: inter-market 450,000 in the early market and 600,000 in the noon market. Various banks' foreign accounts received and settled more than 1.1 million, and the amount of banknotes collected and issued was 160 to 170,000. Money shop Foreign Public collected and settled 7.4 million, and ocean transfer funds settled more than 200,000. Ocean notes were borrowed for 120,000, and small money shops traded more than 50,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Traded Over Five Million</h3>

The total trading volume in the front and rear markets was 5.11 million yuan, of which the 19 customs bond accounted for 1.2 million yuan, the 96 troop reductions accounted for 950,000 yuan each, and the reorganization, disbandment, and 19 reconstruction bonds accounted for 700,000 yuan each.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Situation Greatly Improved</h3>
<p>Customer Sales Excited, Rebound More Intense</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending stronger, and the upward wind is fierce. In fact, due to the factory tax issue, general retail households are vying to buy. At the same time, spot sales in the customer market are gradually showing excitement. As a result, people's hearts are quite bullish. In short, the bottom plate is too dry, and the rebound is more intense. However, the Japanese and Chao gangs still maintain a calm attitude and have no intention of shorting. However, most retail households believe that several yarn factories have increased their bottom goods due to poor yarn sales, and there are rumors of shutdowns. Therefore, they have been working hard to buy in recent months, so the upward force in January is even more intense, and it is currently difficult to take advantage of the low price for a while.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Retail Households Cover Shorts</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm and bullish. Because the US cotton market atmosphere is stable and the yarn market is rising, people's hearts are good, and the bull's pulling force is particularly strong. General retail households painfully cover their shorts, and the market situation is becoming more and more firm. However, the amount of spot cotton handled by each factory is even more stagnant. However, a part of the yarn factories say that because several yarn factories have poor business and some are temporarily shut down, there is no need to collect raw materials. Many people are still shorting in the far month.</p>
<p>Han Standard Rose Three Mace and a Half. The Han Standard opened in the morning market with a slight rise in US cotton, and the atmosphere remained firm. Each rose by 2 or 3 mace.

<p>Southern Market White Japonica Rice Falling Even More</p>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, domestic arrivals numbered 50 to 60, and sales in all directions were greatly stagnant.

<h3>Flour Market Fell Sharply Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Affected By Low Foreign Wheat Quotes</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, each month saw a sharp drop again. The price of foreign wheat fell by another 3 or 4 corners. The recent quotation for Canadian wheat reached a record low of 5 corners and 2 points, which affected most people's hearts. Although this month is close to the settlement date, the big factories are still adhering to the price, while the small factories are still offering goods. The customer gangs are also observing the situation and pressing tightly, so the price is softening again. The distant months, because of the low price of foreign wheat and the spot, the small and medium-sized factories have been selling out layer by layer from January onwards. Therefore, people's hearts are very empty, and the selling is very smooth. This situation of falling is ultimately tied to the overseas quotes. It is feared that there will still be problems in the future.

The number of deliveries was about 30 truckloads, of which more than 20 truckloads were self-delivered. It was heard that only 4 truckloads were officially delivered and collected by the Shenren Factory. The distant months were initially stable, and then, because the shorts inside and outside the industry saw that the environment was still bad and the price of foreign wheat continued to fall, the market turned bearish again. The price of gold fell back and the exchange rate was extended, which led to more selling pressure. New shorts also made frantic sales, or because the end of this month is far from the crushing high, it is inevitable that there will be a retaliatory psychology. The so-called "everyone is fighting for skill", but the more they fight against the facts, the further away they get. As a result, January fell by 1 mace and 1 point compared to the previous week, February, March, and April each fell by 9 points, and May fell by 7 points.

<h3>Gate North Public Bus Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau Mediated</p>
<p>The Year-End Bonus is Calculated as Twenty Days</p>
<p>Winter Uniforms Will be Discussed at a Later Date</p>
<p>The Striking Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty people, including ticket sellers, drivers, inspectors, and engineers from the No. 1, 2, and 3 bus lines of the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company, went on strike at 7:00 AM the day before yesterday because the company refused to grant year-end double pay and winter uniforms. Passengers did not have to buy tickets. At 6:00 AM yesterday, the company manager, Lei Zhaopeng, stopped the buses from running. All employees then entered the factory and went on strike, not taking the responsibility for interrupting traffic. The company then reported to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Party Department to request mediation. The employees also sent representatives to the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and other agencies to state the process of the strike and request protection of their safety. At 2:00 PM, the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau sent people to mediate and ordered the striking workers to resume work first. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Strike At 6:00 AM yesterday, employees from all departments</p>
<p>Entered the factory as usual, intending to drive the buses out and continue the strike in the same way as the day before, with passengers not having to buy tickets. Company Manager Lei Zhaopeng (from Guangdong) estimated that the loss from the previous day, including ticket prices and gasoline, was about 1,200 yuan. If the strike continued in the same way, the loss would be even greater. At 5:30 AM yesterday, he instructed bus dispatcher Liang Bingheng not to allow any of the 26 buses in the factory to leave the factory. The employees heard the news and all entered the factory to drive, sell tickets, and inspect tickets. Everyone sat on their respective buses, waiting for news from the company and not taking the responsibility for interrupting traffic. Therefore, from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM yesterday, no public buses appeared in Zhabei, and rickshaws suddenly did several times more business.</p>
<p>Petition Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the union sent representatives Liang Guoming and Liu Shouchun to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for mediation. They also sent representatives to the Public Security Bureau in the Fifth District of Baoshan Road to state the strike and request protection of the safety of the employees. The traffic was stopped because the company refused to allow the buses to leave the factory, so the employees were not responsible. A notice was posted at the intersection of Baoshan Road, saying: "Because the employer's treatment is very harsh and the employees' request for improvement has been severely rejected by the employer, we should actively deal with it. However, due to traffic relations, we operated as usual yesterday. This morning, the employer prohibited the buses from leaving the factory, obstructing traffic, and the employer should bear the responsibility. In addition to reporting to the higher authorities for judgment, we hereby declare to let you know the truth. The Chinese Public Bus Workers' Union." The company also reported to the Garrison Command, the Municipal Party Department, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other agencies to request mediation.</p>
<p>Mediation Results At about 11:00 AM, An Zhongrui, Director of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Third Section of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, and Wu Zhenhai, Director of the Investigation Section, went to the Chinese Public Bus Company at 1 Jiaotong Road to investigate everything for reference. At 2:00 PM, Zhou Funong, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Bing, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the company to convene representatives from both labor and management to implement mediation. The following attended: (1) Three labor representatives: Liang Guoming, Ouyang Jian, and Liu Shouchun; (3) Three management representatives: Lei Zhaopeng, Huang Zhongwen, and Wu Hongshu. The result of the consultation was that the representatives of both labor and management agreed to sign a settlement agreement as follows: (1) The company will issue a year-end bonus of 20 days to each person; (2) It will be issued in two installments: the first time on the 28th of this month, and the second time on January 20th of the 20th year; (3) The company will deduct one day's salary from each person's year-end bonus to compensate the management for the losses during the strike. Therefore, all employees resumed work at 2:30 PM, and the company immediately dispatched vehicles. Therefore, traffic on all roads was restored to its original state.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Workers Resumed Work in Full Yesterday</h3>
<p>The pawnshop strike workers were ordered by the union the night before last to resume work in full at 8:00 AM yesterday. The strike committee and all its departments were abolished at the same time, and it was announced that the strike was a victory entirely due to the strong unity of the workers. Hereafter, all members should abide by the rules of the union and obey the discipline of the union. Therefore, all pawnshops in the city opened at 8:00 AM yesterday and operated as usual. The whole incident has come to an end. After the workers' representatives reached a mediation agreement with the Party Department at 9:00 PM the night before last, they returned to the union with more than 200 petitioners to hold a victory meeting, shouting slogans such as "Victory of the Strike" and "Support the Union". All the slogans about various strikes in the meeting place were torn off. The union has completely returned to its original state yesterday.</p>
<h3>After the Liquor Industry Strike</h3>
<p>A Telegram Was Sent to the Provincial Bureau Requesting the Removal of Li Guangzhen</p>
<p>According to Hua Dong News, the liquor industry and workers in this city opposed Li Guangzhen, the director of the Second District Tax Collection Office, who arbitrarily formulated harsh laws and harassed business. They went on strike the day before yesterday and sent representatives to negotiate with the office, but there were no results, causing the labor unrest to expand. The details of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Workers' Congress The workers' union held a general membership meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Gu Jiren was elected chairman and presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported that negotiations between the management and the office had broken down and that everything was waiting to be resolved. Then, the following were discussed: (1) A motion to request the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to provide effective assistance and seek relief was passed. (2) A motion to send representatives to the industry association to report was passed, and Hu, Xu Ziyi, and Wang Ade were elected to attend.</p>
<p>Industry Meeting The industry association held a general membership meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Huang Yuming was elected chairman and presided over the meeting. First, Hu Guchun, the representative of the workers' union, reported the labor's attitude and requested a general strike, etc. Then, the following were discussed: (1) How should we express our opinion on the fact that Li Guangzhen, the director of the tax collection office, arbitrarily formulated regulations and harshly collected taxes? It was resolved: (A) A telegram should be sent to the Provincial Bureau and the Second District to immediately stop and investigate. (B) Li Guangzhen should be informed by letter that he should be fully responsible for the losses caused by the strike. (C) A notice should be published to announce Li Guangzhen's crimes. (2) A motion that the association should petition the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance was passed. (3) A motion to set preconditions for negotiation was resolved: (A) The stamp should be cancelled immediately. (B) Licensed liquor should not be detained. (C) The licensing time should be from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. (D) Compensation should be paid for the losses during the strike.</p>
<p>Petition for Relief Yesterday, separate petitions were submitted to the Municipal Training Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "We are reporting the reasons for the current strike and requesting assistance and relief. Li Guangzhen, the director of the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Public Sale and Tai Jia Alcohol Tax Collection Office in Jiangsu, has been in office for more than a year. He has hired many inspectors who are spread everywhere. He detains liquor at every opportunity and punishes at every detention. He arbitrarily formulates harsh regulations that violate the law and destroy business, oppressing workers. As if that were not enough, he has recently become even more excessive and will add a time stamp to the issued licenses. If the time on the license is exceeded, it will be detained and heavily punished. As a result, the companies do not dare to deliver the goods, and the people are indignant. The whole body of workers is on strike. After several negotiations, there has been no result, and a general strike is bound to be triggered. We are submitting this document to your committee (bureau) for approval and effective assistance and relief, which would be a great help."</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce The Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying: "We are writing to inform you that Li Guangzhen, the director of the Second District White Liquor Public Sale Tax Collection Office in Jiangsu, has been in office for more than a year and has imposed various harsh and indiscriminate penalties. Now, he has become even more excessive and has distorted the public sale regulations, limiting the time on the fully public sale licenses and severely punishing violations, which has triggered a strike by all the companies. It has been five days, and there has been no solution yet. In addition to sending a telegram to the Provincial Bureau in Nanjing and the Second District Sub-Bureau to immediately instruct the tax collection office to follow the original plan, we hereby send this letter to request that your chamber of commerce uphold justice to ensure commercial peace and maintain order. The Shanghai Liang Liquor Industry Association bows in salute." Also, the Industry Association and the Workers' Union sent a similar telegram to the Yellow Director of the Second District Sub-Bureau, which is omitted.</p>
<p>Letter to Li Guangzhen The Industry Association sent a letter to Li Guangzhen, the director of the White Liquor Tax Collection Office, saying: "We are writing to inform you that the companies have had difficulty working due to your office's arbitrary decision to add a time stamp to the licenses, and they have gone on strike. In addition to requesting that you cancel it in writing, we have not received a satisfactory reply. Therefore, we have sent representatives to consult with you, but you have avoided meeting them and only sent Wu Songquan to reply that the situation is imperative. We believe that there is no possibility of consultation, and all the companies are still on strike. If there is a storm or unexpected losses, you must bear full responsibility. We hereby send this letter for your information."</p>
<p>Strike Declaration Dear workers of the city, we have gone on strike due to the oppression of Li Guangzhen, the director of the Second District White Liquor Tax Collection Office. This strike is entirely voluntary and is a strike for our livelihood. Li Guangzhen, the director of the Second District White Liquor Tax Collection Office, has contracted the tax collection business of the Second District White Liquor Public Sale with the qualifications of a city monk. Since taking office, he has used urban means to exploit tax revenue and has hired 60 or 70 inspectors, including voluntary inspectors, probationary inspectors, ordinary inspectors, first-class inspectors, assistant inspectors, special inspectors, foreign firm inspectors, assistant inspectors, and chief inspectors, who are spread everywhere and harassing people. He detains liquor at every opportunity and punishes at every detention. The inspectors' salaries are also appalling. Shanghai is a major commercial port, and the cost of living is very high. The formal inspectors of the office are not provided with food and lodging and only receive 12 yuan per month, so they are harassing people at every opportunity and detaining liquor. The director's intention is to accumulate wealth, so he punishes at every detention. In the past year and a half, the fines imposed on our industry by the office for no reason have reached 30,000 yuan. He has also created various names as tax supplements and penalty slips, without issuing a single tax ticket, encroaching on state funds and treating the law like a shoe. He has also strictly set inspection regulations, requiring each person to have at least five official duties per month, with rewards for more and dismissal for less. Recently, the director suddenly had a strange idea and ordered each company to add a time stamp to the license when leaving the factory, with detention and severe punishment for violators, treating our companies like machines and cattle and horses. If this example is followed, our companies will inevitably violate the regulations and be fined endlessly. Our companies have left their homes to go to Shanghai, hundreds or thousands of miles away, carrying burdens and walking to earn some hard-earned money to support their families. Now, Li Guangzhen has arbitrarily formulated regulations, creating an evil precedent that has never existed in the country, to oppress our industry. Our companies must do their best to resist as long as they have a breath. In addition to petitioning the higher authorities to investigate and deal with the matter impartially, we also hope that our dear workers in the city will give us their sympathy and assistance. We are very grateful and look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the National Lawyers Association on Amnesty</h3>
<p>Those who are Guilty Due to Political Environment</p>
<p>It Seems that it Should Not be Excluded from the Scope of Amnesty</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association believes that the amnesty to be granted on New Year's Day next year has been drafted by the Judicial Yuan together with the Executive Yuan. The scope of the amnesty is limited to political prisoners. All those who are not heinous criminals, incorrigible communists, or those who have committed treasonous acts are within the scope of the amnesty. The method is to reduce or exempt the punishment according to the severity of the crime, etc., which is considered imperfect and proposes suggestions to the National Government. The main points are excerpted as follows: (1) Amnesty includes general amnesty and special amnesty. General amnesty can eliminate the effect of the sentence, while special amnesty can exempt the entire execution of the sentence. If it is already stated that all political prisoners who are not heinous criminals, incorrigible communists, or those who have committed treasonous acts are within the scope of the amnesty, then the effect of the sentence should be fundamentally eliminated for those political prisoners who have been sentenced and who are within the amnesty list. Those who have not been sentenced are the same as those who have not committed a crime. What is the remaining space for reducing or exempting the punishment according to the severity of the crime? Reducing or exempting the punishment according to the severity of the sentence can only be called commutation of sentence and cannot be called general amnesty or special amnesty. (2) Ordinary criminals with strong criminal tendencies, such as genuine homicide and robbery offenders, are undoubtedly guilty, but it is also pitiful that they are trapped in prison due to objective political instability. Now that the Party-State has been re-established and is proclaiming that all should participate in the renovation, and those who have caused political disturbances due to errors in political views can still be forgiven. It seems that those who are unfortunately guilty due to the influence of the political environment should not be excluded from the scope of amnesty.</p>
<h3>Dun Jingluan's Request to Investigate and Recover the Remains of Martyr Cai</h3>
<p>Reclaiming Jinan is Indeed Difficult</p>
<p>Rebuilding the Martyr's Memorial Shrine</p>
<p>Martyr Cai Gongshi died a national hero in the May 3rd Massacre in Jinan, and his remains were concealed by the Japanese. The Jinan case has not been resolved to this day, and his remains have not been found. Recently, it was heard that the site of his martyrdom (the former Shandong Negotiation Office in Jinan) was secretly leased by the Japanese through the house owner Zhang Duheng to the Japanese merchant Xiang Jiang Liusaburo for the Huakang Foreign Firm in an attempt to obliterate the traces of the May 3rd bloodbath. The Shandong Licheng Party Department exposed this and requested the Shandong Provincial Government to reclaim the land and rebuild the martyr's shrine. Madam Cai, Guo Jingluan, was deeply saddened by the news, fearing that Martyr Cai's remains would be moved and destroyed by the Japanese. In addition to sending a letter to the Shandong Provincial Party Department to push for their demands, she also submitted separate petitions to the Central Party Department and the National Government, requesting that they strictly order the Shandong Provincial Government to immediately reclaim the land, investigate and recover the remains for burial. It is also said that Madam Cai intends to go to Jinan to negotiate as soon as she recovers from her illness. The text of her petition is recorded below: The petition is to implore that the Shandong Provincial Government be ordered to reclaim the site where Martyr Cai Gongshi died in Jinan, and to investigate and recover his remains for burial to appease his loyal soul. I, Jingluan's late husband, Martyr Cai Gongshi, died a national hero in the May 3rd Massacre at the former Shandong Negotiation Office in Jinan. His remains were concealed by the Japanese, and their whereabouts were unknown despite extensive searches, which was extremely painful. Later, Jingluan visited Tan Yankai, the former President of the Executive Yuan, to petition for a method to seek their return for burial. He instructed that it was heard that the remains were buried in the rear garden of the office, and that they must wait for the Jinan case to be resolved before they could be investigated and recovered. She also visited Wang Zhengting, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to reiterate her previous request. He instructed her to temporarily restrain her grief and wait for an appropriate time, when he would immediately inform her. All the ways he comforted her were comprehensive. Jingluan could only feel grateful. However, not being able to properly bury her late husband's remains, there was not a day that she was not in pain. Later, Jingluan wanted to seek eternal commemoration of Martyr Cai's tragic history of martyrdom, to awaken the people of the country to never forget the national shame of May 3rd, and was determined to establish Gongshi School. Because there were no funds for the school building, she went to the Nanyang Islands to solicit donations for more than eleven months. Fortunately, overseas Chinese, such as Mr. Chen Jiageng, all knew that to avenge the national shame, schools must be established to constantly warn them. They generously donated, and the funds were somewhat successful. Jingluan returned to China this year. Because the school site had not been allocated in a suitable location, she first established the middle school section in Shanghai, the cultural center. Her intention was to ensure that the people of the country would not forget the bloodbath of May 3rd even for a single day. For several months, she worked hard and exhausted her mental and physical strength. Fortunately, the middle school section was established. Jingluan, originally a weak woman, has suffered from pain and overwork, and dare not be negligent. Yesterday, in her sickbed, she read a newspaper report that the site where Cai, the late martyr of Jinan,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>died in the May 3rd Massacre was actually leased by the house owner Zhang Shuheng to the Japanese merchant Xiang Jiang Liusaburo as a warehouse for the Huakang Foreign Firm after the May 3rd Massacre. This was reported by the Chengxian County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee to the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, which sent a letter to the Shandong Provincial Government, ordering the Jinan Municipal Government to find a way to reclaim the land and rebuild the Martyr's Memorial Shrine. The municipal government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and deal with it. Jingluan received the news and was heartbroken, not knowing where her tears should come from. Thinking that the Jinan case is still pending, she does not know how the traitorous merchant Zhang Shuheng was bribed by the Japanese to dare to rent the house to the enemy country. His crime should be equated with treason. The Japanese have a hundred ways to cunningly plan to obliterate the remains of the late martyrs in the name of Japanese merchants in order to eliminate the traces of the May 3rd Massacre. This is especially expected. It is appropriate to implore your government to immediately order the Shandong Provincial Government to immediately reclaim the house, rebuild the Martyr's Memorial Shrine, severely punish the traitorous merchant Zhang Shuheng, and at the same time investigate and recover the remains of Cai, the late martyr, and others. As soon as Jingluan's sick body is able to move, she will rush to Jinan to collect the remains for burial to appease the loyal soul, and strive to promote the realization of the Martyr's Memorial Shrine. She poured out her heart in this petition and hopes that it will be reviewed and implemented. Both the dead and the living will be grateful. Respectfully presented to Jiang Gong, Chairman of the National Government, Cai Guo Jingluan, Principal of Shishi School.</p>

<h3>Weihaiwei Business Community Petition Delegation Hosts Press Dinner Last Night</h3>
<p>The Weihaiwei Commercial Port Chamber of Commerce delegation hosted a dinner for reporters from various newspapers and news agencies at the Pacific Western Restaurant last night. Dozens of people, including Xie Fusheng, attended. During the dinner, representative Li Yizhi reported on the situation in Weihaiwei after the takeover and the purpose and results of the petition. His report is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the first day that businessmen from our Weihaiwei Commercial Port have met with the press in Shanghai, and it is also the first day that our colleagues have contacted the press during this petition. We are very honored that the senior figures from the press have come despite their busy schedules. Because our colleagues live in the north and have been in the British concession for a long time, there is indeed no suitable opportunity to enjoy a drink and chat with the press. However, we know for sure that Shanghai is the center of the press in our country, and we also know for sure that all the gentlemen who have come here today are the seniors of the press in our country. We have taken the time to invite you gentlemen, and we are very sorry that the hospitality is so inadequate. Therefore, we will explain the status of Weihaiwei, the situation after the recovery of Weihaiwei, and the purpose and process of our petition below: (1) The situation of Weihaiwei. Weihaiwei is located on the northern half of the Shandong Peninsula. The bay is good and does not freeze in winter. During the Qing Dynasty, it was the same as Lushun Port on the north bank as the northern military port of the Beiyang Navy. It was the gate of our country. It was occupied by Japan during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. It was then forcibly leased by the British in the 24th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty for a period of 25 years. It was only recovered this year after 32 years. It will undoubtedly still be our country's military port in the future. (2) The situation after the recovery of Weihaiwei. Weihaiwei was known as a naval port more than 30 years ago and was still a fishing village. During the 30 years of the British lease, such as the mutual communication of roads in transportation construction and the prosperous business in the countryside and commercial port due to the tax-free policy in commerce, it also has a prototype in industry. All income is used to support local expenditures. The national government sent Mr. Xu Zusheng, the special commissioner for the management of Weihaiwei, to investigate this summer, and on October 1st, Wang Jiazhen, the vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was appointed as the receiver commissioner, and Mr. Xu Zusheng was appointed as the management commissioner. The Marine Corps soldiers were transferred from the Northeast Fleet to maintain local security. When Commissioner Xu took over, he told the local people that he would be able to maintain the status quo at the very least. As of now, the local area is still considered to be safe. However, the establishment of customs and other collection agencies has had a significant impact on local industry and commerce. It is reported that more than 30 merchants have closed down after the establishment of customs. (3) The purpose and process of this petition. After the recovery of Weihaiwei, in theory, it should bear the same tax obligations as the general public. However, Weihaiwei does have special circumstances today. During the British lease period mentioned above, Weihaiwei was a tax-free port. There is still considerable prosperity in industry and commerce, with more than 200 merchants and about 4,000 to 5,000 male and female workers who directly and indirectly depend on it for their livelihood. The sudden increase in the burden of national taxes is like a person encountering wind and snow in the summer. Industry and commerce will inevitably plummet, and workers will inevitably lose their jobs and their livelihoods will be unsustainable. Foreigners will have an excuse to influence the state's policy of recovering its leased land. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce, thinking about this, specially ordered our colleagues to go to Beijing to appeal to all parties for a petition, requesting that Weihaiwei be temporarily designated as a tax-free port before the establishment of a military port, or that the tax rate be temporarily reduced and gradually increased to promote the prosperity of industry and commerce and maintain the status quo, so as to avoid foreigners from having an excuse. The contact with all parties has gained the help of Mr. Xie Fusheng. Fortunately, the Central Executive Committee understood and believed that it was necessary to consider it and handed it over to the Central Political Council for detailed deliberation and discussion, and also summoned Commissioner Xu to Beijing for a face-to-face inquiry and instructed our colleagues to return to Weihaiwei to wait quietly. Today, we met in Shanghai on the way, fearing that the outside world would not understand the truth or that our colleagues would be criticized for being unreasonable, and sincerely asked the senior figures in the press to publish the above-mentioned details in the newspapers and explain everything. We are extremely grateful. Today, we are in a hurry and have prepared a simple meal to wish you all good health.</p>
<p>Finally, Xu Chihen and Xie Fusheng, representatives of the press, gave a reply. They dispersed happily at 10:00 p.m. It is said that the representatives are scheduled to return to Weihaiwei on the Fengtian Wheel of the Taikoo Company today (23rd).</p>
<h3>Report of Representatives of the Sino-Dutch Association and the Overseas Chinese Federation Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Feng Hanyue, the representative of the Sino-Dutch Foreign Relations Support Association and the Overseas Chinese Federation, went to Beijing a few days ago to urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the details of the negotiations on the cases of supporting Xiao and opposing the Netherlands. Minister Wang was out, so Hu Zhanzhi, the section chief of the International Department, received him and replied: (1) Regarding the defilement of the Xuxin Temple, a serious protest has been lodged with the Dutch Minister in Peiping. (2) Regarding the Dutch consular treaty in Lishi, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will propose a proper solution after careful deliberation. (3) Regarding the negotiation on the revision of Article 109 of the Dutch regulations (Chinese people assimilate to indigenous people), the unequal regulations will be negotiated and revised. However, this matter must be agreed to by the Dutch government, so the process will take time. (4) Regarding the negotiation on the cancellation of the Dutch colonial council's decision to increase the entry tax to 1,550 shields per person and the dock tax of 75 shields per person for supplemented contract Chinese laborers, the acting representative and the consul general in Java have been repeatedly telegraphed to negotiate seriously. (5) Regarding the revocation of the provisional passport law, it has been decided to reduce the passport fee and the new method will be announced in the near future. (6) Regarding the negotiation on restoring the Kuomintang's public activities in British Malaya and allowing Zheng Luosheng and others to go to British Malaya again, the British government has been telegraphed to negotiate and it should take effect in the near future. (7) Regarding the negotiation on the revocation of the harsh laws of the Dutch government prohibiting the holding of Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week and banning the Three People's Principles textbooks, and the cruel examples of the Immigration Bureau of the country treating overseas Chinese immigrants, negotiations have been conducted many times with little effect. Finally, Section Chief Hu said to Mr. Feng that all the matters requested by the Overseas Chinese Federation are what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should do and should be responsible for. I hope that the overseas Chinese community will not misunderstand. Mr. Feng replied that the Overseas Chinese Federation has absolutely no misunderstanding, but many of the negotiations requested have not been satisfactorily resolved, which inevitably raises suspicions. I hope that the items requested will be completed in advance. Section Chief Hu said that he can be responsible for handling them and will present them to the Minister, etc.</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Took Over the Agricultural Product Inspection Institute Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fertilizers are Inspected as Usual</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat Will be Handled Separately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau previously received a telegram from Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry, ordering it to take over the Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Institute established by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and scheduled to send personnel to take over on the 22nd of this month. The bureau specially sent Secretary Zhang Qiwen, Director of the Office Li Wen, Director of the Cotton Inspection Office Ye Yuanding, Director of the Chemical Inspection Office Zhang Weiru, and staff members Liu Jianxiong, Zhang Mengping, Lu Chongrong, etc. to the Agricultural Product Inspection Institute yesterday to handle the handover. The former Deputy Director of the Institute, Cai Wuji, and the Chief of the First Section, Yu Qianshan, supervised the staff to divide the documents and instruments into four groups and handed them over clearly. The handover was completed from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It is reported that after the takeover, fertilizers will be inspected as usual, and the import of cotton and the import and export of wheat will be handled separately. The original Jiangbei Branch and the inspection offices and offices attached to various counties will be abolished uniformly after the Ministry approves the report. In terms of personnel, the bureau will implement a tight policy and give priority to the employment of seven necessary staff members from the former inspection institute. In addition, no additional personnel will be added to show thrift. Fertilizer inspection will be merged into the Chemical Inspection Office, and cotton and wheat inspection will be merged into the Cotton Inspection Office.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Imported Passports</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Period Will be Extended</p>
<p>Regarding the inspection of passports for foreigners entering the country, the Central Executive Yuan had previously announced the regulations on August 22 and scheduled to implement them in accordance with the regulations after a month. Each local government will handle this separately. The area in this city will be handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The four-month preparation period according to the original plan has expired yesterday. However, according to the news from the Public Security Bureau, the preparation is not enough and it will submit a request to the Municipal Government to extend the period in the next few days. It will probably take another six months to implement. During this extended period, it will begin to revise various procedures and rules for passport inspection.</p>
<h3>Dredging Bureau's Dredger Launched</h3>
<p>Built by Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant</p>
<p>The "Hailong" dredger ordered by the Dredging Bureau at the Jiangnan Shipyard has been completed and the launching ceremony was held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Those who participated in the ceremony included General Tax Commissioner Meierhe, Dredging Bureau Director Song Ziliang, Jianghai Customs Commissioner Mei Weiliang, Dredging Bureau Chief Engineer Jiadlai, Jiangnan Shipyard Director Chen Shaokuan, and representatives from the Municipal Government and various bureaus. After the daughter of Mei Weiliang performed the bottle-breaking ceremony, the ship was launched in cheers and applause. Chen Shaokuan entertained the guests and thanked Ms. Mei, presenting her with a bouquet of roses and several stationery items. He also gave a speech, saying: (Today is the day for the launching of the dredger built by our plant for the Dredging Bureau. We are honored that Director Mei, his daughter, and guests from all walks of life have come. Since the opening of our plant, we have built many ships, from large passenger ships to warships and various ships from various countries, to small steamships. Dredgers are the first record this time, which adds another page to the shipbuilding history of our plant, which is very glorious. Moreover, during this construction period, the Dredging Bureau's move is timely, because opening ports and engaging in commerce is in line with our President's plan, which is especially admirable. The Dredging Bureau's business is to make Shanghai a large-scale commercial port, which is not only beneficial to our country, but also of great benefit to shipping merchants from various countries coming to China. I am very happy that you have come here to attend the ceremony. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Jiangnan Shipyard and take this opportunity to congratulate you on the festival. At that time, Song Ziliang had already left, so Mei Weiliang replied and dispersed. The Hailong is 150 feet long, 34 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and has a dredging depth of 45 feet.</p>
<h3>Starting to Recover the Navigation Rights of Wuxue</h3>
<p>Remove Japanese Ship Hulks for Chinese Merchants to Use</p>
<p>Please Government to Prohibit Foreign Ships from Going to Wuxue Again</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company restored Yangtze River navigation last month, it has been striving to revitalize national ships and recover the navigation rights of the Yangtze River. Coincidentally, a dispute occurred at the Japanese ship dock in Wuxue. The company took the opportunity to actively recover the lost navigation rights of Wuxue. Li Yunliang, the director of the Hankou branch, went to Wuxue to negotiate in person because the matter concerned national sovereignty. At the same time, he asked the head office to request the central government to prohibit foreign ships from going to the port again. This matter is in progress. The reporter went to various parties to investigate the situation and recorded it as follows: The origin of foreign ships stopping in Wuxue. Wuxue is above Jiujiang and is neither a commercial port nor an open port. Foreign ships should not stop there. However, in the second year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, the Japanese Daizhenmaru transported Japanese soldiers to the Yangtze River and transshipped them in Wuxue. A barge capsized and many passengers drowned. Local gentry and merchants raised funds to set up a hulk on the river bank exclusively for Chinese river ships to berth. At that time, it was the Xinhai Revolution. Chinese ships stopped sailing, and foreign merchants such as Taikoo and Nisshin ignored the violation of the treaty and stopped in Wuxue. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, a third hulk was added and became exclusively for Japanese ships. At that time, Guo Dingcun of the Lizhi Company, who was in charge of this matter and introduced foreign ships into the interior, said that it was to facilitate transportation, but he did not expect it to become the situation of taking over the owner's place today. The shocking loss in 20 years. Wuxue Port is a place where ramie is produced, and the annual export is 200,000 dan. The second is tobacco leaves, cotton, tung oil, and miscellaneous grains, about 50,000 to 60,000 pieces. The water feet alone account for more than 200,000 taels per year. Imported goods are mainly cotton yarn, piece goods, and sugar. The loss of transportation and the overflow of passenger fees in the past 20 years is at least five to six million yuan. All taxation procedures for goods loading at the port are handled by the Jianghan Customs.</p>
<p>Chinese ships first recovered the third hulk. The outflow of rights and interests in the past 20 years cannot be delayed. The third Lizhi Company hulk, which was exclusively used by Nisshin Company, caught fire a few days ago. Both the hulk and the goods were destroyed by the fire, resulting in huge losses. Lizhi Company filed a negotiation with Nisshin Company, demanding compensation for reconstruction, but the Japanese were cunning and ignored it. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company learned of the news and believed that it was the best opportunity to recover the navigation rights of Wuxue. It ordered the Hankou branch to negotiate with Guo Dingcun of Lizhi to take over the No. 3 hulk and stop giving it to Japanese merchants for berthing. Director Li went to Wuxue in person. After various negotiations, he finally completed the matter and submitted a request to the government to issue an order prohibiting Japanese ships from using the hulk exclusively. The hulk is now under the control of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and has signed a contract with Lizhi. Director Li of the branch believes that Taikoo, Nisshin, and others have no treaty basis for berthing in Wuxue. It was Lizhi's mistake that led to the loss of rights and insults to the country. Although the No. 3 hulk has been taken over by the bureau, Japanese ships still refuse to give up the rights of the port, and British ships continue to stop as usual. Unless national power is used, they cannot be expelled. Therefore, the bureau has submitted a request to the National Government to immediately order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the British and Japanese governments to prohibit the Yangtze River ships of their respective countries from berthing there again in order to recover the navigation rights. Director Li of the branch came to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday to discuss the progress with General Manager Li Zhonggong.</p>
<p>The Chinese ships of Tuanfeng also go to Tuanfeng Town, which is more than 100 miles downstream of Hankou. The annual exports of goods such as medicinal materials and staple grains are worth 20 to 30 million yuan. The Shangzhou Chamber of Commerce is requesting the Shanghai Chinese Ship Company to add a ship port in Fangbu to facilitate transportation and recover the outflow of Yangtze River freight. The Sanbei Company in this port has already accepted the request of the Tuanfeng merchants and is about to include Tuanfeng Town in the two new Yangtze River ships Hongli and Hongzhen for upstream and downstream navigation lines.</p>
<h3>Navigation News</h3>
<p>Tianjin is Frozen. Yesterday, the shipping companies in this port received a telegram from Tianjin saying that the Baihe River had ice yesterday due to the severe cold weather. All ships to Tianjin must use an icebreaker to guide them into Tangzhan Port. Chinese ships without icebreakers can only berth at Tanggu Port. If the ice does not melt after the new Ming Wheel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company returns to Shanghai this time, it will stop sailing to Tianjin. Jianghua is Towed Out. The Jianghua Wheel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was stranded in Zhenjiang. It was reported in this newspaper yesterday. It was heard that the ship was towed out by a small wheel sent by the Zhenjiang branch after the tide rose. The ship has been launched and is going to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Railway Freight Rate Conference Postponed</h3>
<p>Postponed to March 1 Next Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a telegram from Ma of the Ministry of Railways yesterday saying that the National Railway Freight Rate Conference was originally scheduled to be held on January 15 next year. Recently, it was claimed from various places that the originally scheduled date was very pressing and they were afraid that they would not be able to rush to complete it. The ministry has changed the date to March 1 next year in order to allow sufficient time for investigation and preparation. Please check. Seal of Ma of the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Railway Commercial Conference by Feng Yunchu</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, in view of the stability of the situation on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, and in order to reorganize railway affairs and develop commercial transport, has scheduled a commercial conference for the two railways on January 5th of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1931]. Prior notice has been given to relevant agencies, businesses, banks, and transportation companies along the routes to send representatives to the conference and to solicit opinions widely for practical results. It is learned that Feng Yunchu, Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Transportation Association and General Manager of the Da Zhonghua Transportation Company, is also preparing to participate in the conference. He has prepared a summary of his opinions, and the original text is recorded below for your respectful consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted: Your Bureau's notice states that due to various obstacles in recent years, the transportation of goods on the two railways has not been fully developed, causing difficulties for both businesses and the railways. Now that the military situation has stabilized, it is imperative to find ways to reorganize the freight transport on the two railways. In addition to the internal affairs that your railway is planning and improving, the conference should discuss and thoroughly improve any difficulties faced by the shipping companies, in order to achieve the benefits of cooperation. Therefore, it is proposed to convene a business conference in the near future, inviting responsible representatives from relevant agencies, businesses, banks, and transportation companies along the routes to discuss and study the matter, and to send responsible representatives to the conference before January 5th. If there are any opinions, please send them to the Bureau for discussion one week before the meeting. We admire the Bureau's intention to widely solicit opinions in order to achieve practical results in developing freight transport. In addition to replying separately and sending a responsible representative to attend the meeting, the following are our sincere opinions:</p>
<p>The transportation industry, on the one hand, facilitates the transport of goods and the circulation of finance for the convenience of merchants and the people. On the other hand, it assists the railways in developing their business. The relationship between the two is extremely close. However, due to frequent military conflicts in recent years, traffic on various routes has been blocked, business has declined, and it has been difficult to maintain operations. Fortunately, traffic on various routes is gradually recovering, and the Bureau is urgently seeking to reorganize and improve the transportation of goods. We are deeply grateful for your plans. Upon investigation, the biggest difficulty for shipping companies is the scarcity of wagons, which we believe is already being addressed in the Bureau's plans. In addition, the following should be improved at present:</p>
<p>(1) In recent years, vehicles on the two railways have often been used for military purposes, resulting in commercial goods arriving at the depot often taking three to five days or more to load. As a result, the bulk commodities of rice, wheat, grain, cotton yarn, cloth, and silk cocoons originating from Suzhou, Wuxi, Ningbo, and Zhenjiang are now mostly shipped by small steamers or civilian boats, which arrive on time and involve less transfer and damage. The cargo ships on the inland rivers are almost like shuttles. All of this was once the profit of the railways. In the future, the railway should provide as many cargo wagons as possible for commercial transport, even if there are occasional military uses, a portion must still be reserved for commercial transport so that commercial goods are not delayed. In this way, the goods from Suzhou, Wuxi, Ningbo, and Zhenjiang can all be converted to rail transport, and the railway's revenue will increase daily.</p>
<p>(2) The Beijing-Shanghai Railway only allows people with affixed photos to ride without a ticket, which is inconvenient for transportation companies to solicit passengers and goods. It is requested that the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's method of canceling the affixed photos be followed, so that companies can send more experienced staff to various places at any time to solicit goods. This will not only help the transportation companies' business, but also have a relationship with the railway's revenue.</p>
<p>(3) Very few vehicles arrive at the North Station for import, and all export vehicles rely on the Maigen Road Station for supply. The empty wagons from Maigen Road Station to the North Station arrive early or late, in large or small quantities. If there are few wagons at the North Station, passengers and goods cannot be transported smoothly, and the coolies at the North Station also suffer from the uneven distribution of idle and busy work. For example, if there are no wagons from Maigen Station in the first half of the day, the coolies have no work to do. When import vehicles arrive at the North Station and the vehicles from Maigen Station also happen to arrive, the coolies are not dispatched evenly. Therefore, complete wagons of goods cannot be transported smoothly, and less-than-carload shipments are even more difficult. Moreover, if passengers and goods are congested, the warehouse cannot accommodate them, resulting in road blockages and traffic inconvenience. If it can be stipulated that Maigen Station should send ten or twenty empty wagons to the North Station every night to stay overnight, and load the wagons from Maigen Station first the next morning, and then load the import heavy wagons after they are unloaded in the afternoon, then everything will be convenient and easy.</p>
<p>(4) The warehouses at the North Station are in a row. Although the import and export areas are separated, after the import wagons are unloaded and sent to the export warehouse for loading, it takes a lot of time to wait for the locomotive to move them. Moreover, the platform of the export warehouse is extremely short, and the two railways are loading at the same time, which is extremely crowded. If the empty wagons are parked on the second track of the warehouse road, there is no platform to rely on, and it is dangerous when shunting. It is possible to add a warehouse at the original unloading platform for cattle, and stack the import and export goods in two places, which will make loading and unloading more convenient.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to the stipulated loading and unloading fees, the coolies at each station often invent various names and extort money. Many passengers are afraid to speak out. It is hoped that the railway will find a way to rectify this situation in order to facilitate operations.</p>
<p>(6) In recent years, there have often been shortages in the number of pieces of goods transported by rail. The losses are worrisome. It is requested that the railway police be instructed to strengthen prevention and protection of passengers and goods in order to protect merchants.</p>
<p>(7) At present, river and sea vessels are fiercely competing for freight transport. In the past, goods arriving from the sea route to Xuzhou were transferred to the Jinpu and Beijing-Shanghai lines to Shanghai. Now, however, most are transported to Dapu and then shipped to Shanghai by boat, resulting in a gradual decrease in the amount of goods from the Jinpu line on the Beijing-Shanghai line. It is requested that the railway take the overall situation into account so that goods from the sea and Jinpu lines do not go through Dapu, in order to increase revenue.</p>
<p>The above items are all easy to implement. Therefore, we submit our opinions and prepare a summary for your selection. We sincerely hope that you will review and approve them for discussion.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>Feng Yunchu, Representative of Da Zhonghua Transportation Company.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Recent Events Compilation</h3>
<p>Year-End Bonus Paid as Usual: It is the practice of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration to propose a certain percentage of profits for distribution to employees as a reward at the end of each year, depending on the business situation. It is now learned that this year's bonus will be paid as usual, and the relevant salary slips are being prepared by various departments.</p>
<p>Changes in Freight Inspection: The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, in order to promote freight transport, has specially promoted He Jingchong, head of the Inquiry Office at the North Station, to be the Freight Inspector of the Eastern Section. It is said that He is a graduate of the Railway Management Science Department of Jiaotong University and is very familiar with railway affairs, and will make great contributions to commerce in the future.</p>
<p>Letter of Thanks from Northeastern Military Officer for Safekeeping Luggage: Shen Ruikun of the Northeastern Border Defense Aviation Headquarters took the first express train from Shanghai to Beijing a few days ago. When the train arrived at Zhenjiang, the special express train arrived one after another. Shen, in a hurry to go to Beijing, changed to the special express train and immediately moved his luggage. Unexpectedly, before he could finish moving his luggage, the train started. He had to take the express train to Beijing. Fortunately, the conductor noticed the luggage that had been moved to the special express train and took care of it, so it was not lost. Therefore, after Shen arrived in Beijing, he sent a letter of thanks to Liu and Zheng, the heads of the Traffic Department, for their effective supervision and the diligence of the railway staff.</p>

<h3>Xie Liheng, Zhang Meian, et al. Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>To Negotiate Matters Concerning the Central National Medical Center</p>
<p>The Nanjing Central National Medical Center will be officially established on January 15th of next year. The Shanghai National Medical and Pharmaceutical Groups Joint Federation previously decided at its first standing committee meeting to hold a grand and enthusiastic celebration on the day of the Center's establishment. In addition to Shanghai, which has already been initiated and prepared by the General Federation in conjunction with the Shanghai National Medical Association and the National Pharmaceutical Association, medical and pharmaceutical groups in various places will hold celebrations separately in accordance with the celebration methods set by the General Federation. However, the General Federation believes that the significance of this celebration of the establishment of the National Medical Center is very far-reaching, and the methods are extremely grand. There are actually matters that need to be properly negotiated with the National Medical Center beforehand. In addition, medical and pharmaceutical groups in various places attach great importance to the content and organization of the National Medical Center, and letters and telegrams are constantly inquiring and requesting instructions. Therefore, the General Federation yesterday decided at its second standing committee meeting to delegate Standing Committee Members Xie Liheng and Zhang Meian to go to Beijing as representatives to request instructions on all matters from the Central National Medical Center in order to facilitate the process. It is heard that Xie and Zhang left for Beijing by overnight train last night after being delegated. Accompanied by Jiang Wenfang, Director of the Secretariat of the General Federation, and Zhang Shisheng, Director of the Construction Department. They will return to Shanghai as soon as their mission is completed.</p>

<h3>Yang Xingfo Wants a Divorce</h3>
<p>Asks Lawyer Wu Jingxiong to Sue</p>
<p>His Wife Says She Doesn't Want to Divorce</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Xingfo, Vice President of the Academia Sinica, decided to divorce due to severe insult and abuse from his wife, Ms. Zhao Zhipo. A week ago (the 14th), he flew to Shanghai and asked lawyers Wu Jingxiong, Yu Chengtiao, and others for legal assistance. The lawyers immediately sent a letter to Ms. Zhao on behalf of Mr. Yang, proposing an amicable divorce. Subsequently, they received a reply from Ms. Zhao denying the insult and stating that she did not want a divorce. In order to calm the matter, Lawyer Wu, in his capacity as a friend, once sent a letter to Mr. Yang, asking if he could recall the past and reconcile. He also advised that marital psychology is very complex and cannot be fully understood by outsiders. Moreover, a strong wind does not last all morning, and a sudden rain does not last all day. How can the estrangement between husband and wife last long? And a moment of separation or reunion is related to a lifetime of joy or sorrow. As the saying goes, clothes are better new, but swords are better old. It seems that one should not be so resolutely determined. However, Mr. Yang's determination to divorce is extremely firm. Yesterday, he replied to Lawyer Wu, saying that he appreciated his prudence and forbearance. However, he has suffered the pain of marriage for twelve years, and his lung disease and hemoptysis have repeatedly brought him to the brink of danger. This is not a simple estrangement between ordinary couples. He has always known how to love himself and is also brave enough to sacrifice. If he is not forced to do so, he will never resort to divorce. Now that he has started, he must fight to the end. A Western proverb says, "Give me liberty or give me death," which is the slogan for this marriage. Observing the above situation, one party is determined to divorce, while the other party is determined not to divorce. It is now heard that Mr. Yang fears that this matter cannot be resolved without legal procedures, and is prepared to file a lawsuit soon.</p>
<h3>Russian Gambling Den Uncovered on Avenue Foch</h3>
<p>Appears to be a Club on the Surface</p>
<p>But Actually Engages in Various Gambling Activities</p>
<p>The Owner Takes a Considerable Cut</p>
<p>Many Gamblers of Different Nationalities</p>
<p>The Shanghai United General Association at 306 Avenue Foch, established by Russians and headed by Ying Sipeike, Li Lifu, and others, appears to be an entertainment venue for Russian expatriates in Shanghai. In reality, it is a disguised gambling den. There are approximately two types of gambling: "Lotto" and "Salon de Quine," both of which are foreign gambling products. The method of gambling with "Lotto" is as follows: a round copper ball with beads numbered inside is placed on the table. There is also a thin board, approximately one foot long and four inches wide, with red numbers written in black. This board is nailed to the wall, and the numbers are all connected to electric lights. Gamblers first pay their bets and purchase a certain number. The ball shaker, after the gamblers have placed their bets, activates the mechanism, and the beads inside the ball fall out of the hole. If it is number one, the electric light on number one on the black board goes out. Then, the shaking is repeated until all the electric lights on the numbers on the wall are extinguished, which is considered the end of the game. The number that goes out first is the winning number, and all bets placed on that number are returned to the winner as the prize money. The owner of the gambling den then orders the winner to pay a certain amount of money, called "head money." The method of gambling with "Salon de Quine" is simpler than "Lotto." A gambling device with a mechanism is also placed on the table, and paper cards are placed inside. The cards have black dots to count the numbers. Gamblers sit around the table, and the machine operator, after the gamblers have placed their bets, shakes the machine, and the cards are released one after another from the opening. The banker distributes one card each in order, face down, to each person. The banker's card is the last to be distributed. The machine is activated again and another card is issued to each person. This card must be placed face up, and everyone counts the points of the two cards. If the number exceeds nine, it is considered a loss. If it is exactly nine points, or seven or eight points, and the gambler's score is less than seven or eight, the banker wins the entire game. This method is similar to the popular "circle of warmth." The General Association was originally located at 5 Weihai Road and moved to Avenue Foch last winter. When it applied to the French Municipal Council for a General Association license, it only stated that it was a club for Russian expatriates. Members were all Russians, and foreigners and Chinese were absolutely not allowed. The French Municipal Council believed that its rules were strict and that there were no drawbacks, so it signed the notification and sent people to investigate from time to time. At first, because its members were very few and there were no illegal activities, it did not interfere. But recently the number of people has suddenly increased. The method of attracting people is to engrave the name of the association on cards and distribute them to Chinese and foreign gamblers. If they want to gamble, they only need to take this card to the association and they will be immediately invited in. Otherwise, they will be turned away. Once a gambler enters the gambling den, they become a natural member of the association, so the membership roster already has more than 1,790 people. However, there are still many who have not been registered, because the membership procedures are not as strict as before, regardless of nationality. With so many people, gambling games are held frequently, and the wins and losses every night are considerable. The owners of the den collect a commission daily, as little as one or two hundred yuan and as much as a thousand yuan. Therefore, the two owners employ nine assistants, all of Russian nationality, who are responsible for various matters and are paid high salaries. The clerk receives a monthly salary of 120 yuan, the member registrar receives 75 yuan, and the people who record the numbers, report the numbers, arrange the seats, and the four accountants each receive 60 yuan. The people who manage the gambling equipment receive slightly less. The magnitude of its scale and the vastness of its expenses can be seen. Recently, someone reported the secrets of the gambling den to the Xinzha Police Station. The night before last, at midnight, West Inspector Deng, along with Chinese and Western detectives, rushed to investigate. When they entered the building, they heard the sounds of gambling. Both upstairs and downstairs were very noisy. They directed the detectives to prevent escape and began the arrest. A total of 32 gamblers were captured in one room downstairs, and 46 gamblers were captured in two rooms upstairs, along with Ying Sipeike, Li Lifu, the two heads of the gambling den, and the nine employees. All the gambling equipment was taken back to the police station for interrogation one by one. The 78 gamblers were of British, Russian, Portuguese, and other nationalities. Each was ordered to deposit a certain amount of cash to be released on bail. Ying Sipeike and the other eleven people were detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Luo Renji conducted the preliminary hearing. Tu Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, accused Ying and the other two of running a gambling den, and accused the nine employees of aiding and abetting the running of a gambling den. He also presented the details of the raid and the two gambling methods in great detail. Then he presented the copied account books as evidence, proving that the gamblers were not all members of the association and that the owners of the gambling den made a huge amount of money every day. The defendants then hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and others to defend them. Judge Luo adjourned the hearing because it was already noon and he did not have time for a detailed interrogation. He ordered that the defendants be detained and that the hearing be rescheduled for Wednesday. As for the 78 gamblers, because they were of different nationalities and some had consular jurisdiction while others did not, the police station had to investigate and then prosecute those without consular jurisdiction in the Special Court. The hearing is also scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Westward Has Suspicion in the Assassination of Foreign Employees</h3>
<p>Arrested and Interrogated by the 7th District Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Zhu Bielin (transliteration), a Brazilian national and general manager of the Jiangpu Bureau's repair shop at Zhanghuahama, Wusong, was walking from the bureau to the Zhanghuahama train station at about 2:30 p.m. on the 20th when he was suddenly ambushed and shot by a thug hiding by the roadside at the back door of the He Poshi Office. The bullet hit the vital point of the temple, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The body was inspected by the local court on the afternoon of the 21st, and Prosecutor Yang was sent to the scene of the incident. It was found that the deceased was indeed shot and killed by someone during his lifetime. It was ordered that the body be placed in a coffin by the family members pending the arrest of the murderer. It was learned that Chen Guangming, the servant hired by the deceased during his lifetime, accompanied the deceased out of the Jiangpu Bureau repair shop before the incident. When the deceased was shot, Chen went to the Zhanghuahama train station alone and took a train to Shanghai. An acquaintance of Chen sat with him in the train and did not mention the fact that Mr. Zhu was shot. The 7th District Public Security Bureau believes that Chen is highly suspected, so he has already been arrested. After interrogation, his confession has many contradictions, but there is no conclusive evidence at this time.</p>
<h3>A Child's Head Was Found in a Rush Bag</h3>
<p>Is It a Torn Ticket or Asking for a Flower Meeting?</p>
<p>A small rush bag was found abandoned on a vacant lot at 637 Rue Lafayette in the French Concession at 10 a.m. yesterday. A passerby caught a glimpse of it and went forward to open it. To their horror, the bag contained the head of a child, approximately five or six years old, who had been dead for seven or eight days. A crowd gathered nearby to watch. The patrolman reported to the Lukiawan Police Station and sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The police determined that the skin of the head was rotten and blurred, making it impossible to identify. They notified the Tongren Fuyuantang to send a staff member to carry the body to the examination room. The police chief ordered photographs to be taken pending investigation and verification. Some people speculate that it may be a member of the flower meeting who cut it from a corpse coffin and took it back to ask for a flower meeting before discarding it, or that it may be a kidnapping gang who tore up the ticket and cut off the head to discard it.</p>

<h3>Bandit Leader from Suqian Arrested in Shanghai</h3>

Later, he was severely suppressed by the bandit suppression army. Zhu and his followers resisted arrest, and the government troops were unable to break through. Therefore, they set fire to his nest. Zhu escaped over the wall and was wanted. Now, a victim, Ji Xiaochuan, ran into Wang Jinsheng, Zhu's mother's brother, in Suzhou. He reported the crime and was arrested by the Wuxian Local Court for interrogation. He confessed that Zhu was hiding at 11 Xirongqing Road, Roberts Road, Shanghai West.

The patrol leader sent police officers to summon him, but Wang Yougen had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Gao Yougen and Zhao Heshang were taken back to the First Branch of the Sixth District for questioning. According to Zhao Heshang's statement during the preliminary hearing conducted by Director Wang, he denied the matter. Gao Yougen admitted that he had impersonated a narcotics inspector, but that what he found was not opium, but red pills, which are now stored at Zhang Fengqi's place. After obtaining the confession, Director Wang believed that the case involved impersonating a public official and privately investigating narcotics, which was a major matter. He immediately prepared a document and sent it to the bureau for review.</p>

<h3>Arrest and Prosecution for Fraudulent Acquisition of Property</h3>
<p>Builders, Be Careful</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent cases in the city of people posing as employees of the Public Works Bureau to extort money from those building houses. However, most citizens are afraid of trouble and, even if they know they have been deceived, are unwilling to come forward to report it. As a result, officials, although wanting to investigate, often lack evidence and cannot take action. It was recently learned that in the Hanjiazhai area of Yangjing Town in Pudong, a resident named Li Miaoquan added two more buildings next to his house last month, contracted by Han Linsheng, a foreman from the neighborhood. The foreman, seeing that Li Miaoquan was kind and easily deceived, claimed that he could handle the construction without needing to obtain a permit from the Public Works Bureau. Li Miaoquan, thinking he could save money, was very grateful. Unexpectedly, when the house was nearing completion, two men claiming to be employees of the Public Works Bureau arrived, saying they were there to check the permit and that without a permit, there would be a fine of two hundred yuan. At the time, Li Miaoquan was unaware of the trap set by Han Linsheng and still regarded Han as a confidant, seeking his advice to reduce the fine. Han Linsheng pretended to mediate and suggested that Li Miaoquan pay forty yuan to settle the matter. It is said that Li Miaoquan, unwilling to be deceived, is willing to testify, and the Public Works Bureau has confirmed the matter and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to arrest Han Linsheng and send him to the local court for legal prosecution to deter others from following suit.</p>

He was shot three times, once in the wrist and twice in the chest. The murderer fled the scene. His family sent Wang Baozhan to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road, where he died. The Xinzha Police Station, because the hospital is within the concession area and according to concession regulations, requires an autopsy by the coroner, transported the body to the coroner's office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, accompanied the forensic doctor to the office to examine the body. According to Wang Kuai, the wife of the deceased, and Wang Xianggu, the lawyer son of the deceased, who submitted the case, stated the circumstances of Wang Baozhan's assassination and requested to claim the body for coffin burial. Xu approved it and ordered the body to be handed over to his wife for coffin burial. It is reported that the deceased was very diligent in his work in the rickshaw guild and was deeply trusted by the guild.

<h3>Anti-Drug Association Requests Prohibition of New Drugs</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association recently discovered that the most famous narcotic drug manufacturer in Basel, Switzerland, HOFFNANNLAROCHE, has recently produced two new drugs, one named PANAOPON and the other ALLONAL. Their harm is no different from that of morphine and heroin. The association is taking measures to transport them to China. To prevent this from happening, in addition to a letter from Dr. Wu Liande, the executive member of the association, to the Customs Commissioner, requesting attention to suppression, the association has also sent a letter to the Central Anti-Opium Committee, requesting strict investigation to prevent the spread of narcotic drugs even further. The original letter is excerpted as follows (to whom it may concern: According to reports, the most famous drug manufacturer in Basel, Switzerland, HOFFNAPON, has ALLONAL. Although the factory claims that these drugs do not cause addiction like opium, their harm is actually no different from that of heroin and morphine. The US government has strictly prohibited these drugs and has not listed them in the prescription book. Many people use them for suicide or to poison others, which proves that the harm of these drugs is the same as that of opium and other narcotics. If they are not prohibited as soon as possible, I am afraid that they will cause endless harm, etc. Accordingly, we hereby send a letter to your committee to strictly investigate and eliminate the source of the disaster. We are extremely fortunate to be able to refuse drugs. Sincerely, Anti-Opium Committee).</p>
<h3>Insurance Policies Should Comply with Regulations and Affix Stamps</h3>

<h3>Qu Shao Yi Lectures at the Global Student Association</h3>
<p>Current Law and Modern Society</p>
<p>The Global Chinese Student Association invited Mr. Qu Shao Yi to lecture on the topic of "Current Law and Modern Society" the previous night at 7 p.m. Mr. Zhu Shaoping chaired the meeting. In his speech, he stated that the relationship between law and society can be divided into two theories. One is that law creates society, meaning that legislators do not need to consider the current state of society, but only need to base the law on legal principles. The other is that society creates law, meaning that law should be based on the state of society. Both theories have their reasons. Since the establishment of the National Government, China's laws have gradually been perfected. For example, the principles of striving to protect the weak and striving for gender equality can gradually promote social evolution. Unfortunately, it is inevitable that the legislation is too strict and the enforcement is too lenient. Therefore, I believe that the law cannot completely agree with the current society, but it cannot be separated from the current society.</p>
<p>I think it should be introduced slowly, he said. After the speech, the audience stood up and thanked him and dispersed.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper reported that the China Motor Bus Company appointed Ren Zuojun as a representative to negotiate with the employees. This news is slightly inaccurate. According to me, I was invited to mediate at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month by Fan Yifeng, the standing supervisor of the labor side, and Lei Zhaopeng, the capital side. Therefore, I was actually in the position of a third party and not representing the capital side. During the mediation, I only kindly advised the labor leaders not to go on strike and promised to do my best to mediate. If the two sides cannot resolve the issue, they should first ask the Social Affairs Bureau for a decision without resorting to this urgent method, which would hurt their feelings. The labor side wants to accuse me of going on strike, which is really disheartening. Therefore, I hereby send a special letter requesting immediate correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Ren Zuojun, December 22</p>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper published on the 21st that the French Concession Market intends to establish a Joint Association. There is no such association in the French Concession. There is only the French Concession Market Road Market Stallholders Association, but the French Consulate has not approved the establishment. Therefore, we hereby request correction. Sincerely, French Concession Police Department</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Physiology of Pregnancy and Obstetrics and Pathology of Pregnancy and Obstetrics by Chen Baoqin</h3>
<p>Written by Yang Yuanji</p>
<p>Our country has always been known as the most populous country in the world. This may be a point of pride for the Chinese nation. The reason, of course, is due to China's vast territory and long history, which is indeed unmatched by any modern country. However, because the Chinese national character lacks a spirit of research and development, always clinging to inherited and traditional ideas, even though it is an ancient country with thousands of years of culture, it is not as advanced as new and emerging countries with only a few hundred years of history. Therefore, the point of pride in having the largest population is also about to be shaken. According to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, China's population rate has hardly increased in the last hundred years. Therefore, China's border areas still suffer from vast land with sparse population. For example, the border regions of Mongolia, Tibet, and Northeast China are gradually being invaded and encroached upon by foreigners, and are about to become their colonies completely. This is something that deserves our attention. We ourselves do not cultivate and plant natural land and forests, but instead allow foreigners to exploit our resources. Who can deny that China's poverty today is not partly due to the nation's poor management? In recent years, the State Council has not failed to earnestly discuss the issues of Mongolia and Tibet, but in reality, it is inevitable that it is difficult to reach them effectively. How can we have the strength to prevent them from invading? Examining the reasons why people from various countries spare no effort to travel across mountains and seas to the borders of China and other remote areas, it is nothing more than being forced by livelihood and the bravery of their nations. The productivity of the land is limited. With their population increasing so rapidly, the natural resources of their own country are naturally unable to meet the demand. Following the natural phenomenon of survival competition, they can only seek survival in places where they can make a living. Therefore, in politics, the people in power also use this natural trend to implement a policy of expanding territory, so there are clauses that reward childbirth and tax single people. It goes without saying that our country lags behind in everything. In addition, the central plains provinces are rich in natural resources, and there are few times when supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, the people are used to enjoying what they have. How can they be willing to endure the hardship of cultivating the borders? But the current trend has reached a dangerous stage. If you do not cultivate, others will cultivate. If you do not manage, others will manage. If you do not stand firm, others will push you down. Taking the recent situation as an example, because our population has increased little in recent years, while the population of other countries has increased so rapidly, the number of foreigners in China is more than in any other country. This is already a precursor to China falling into the colonies of various countries. This phenomenon, except for the far-sighted Dr. Sun Yat-sen who has long been aware of it, is rarely noticed by others.</p>
<p>Why has China's population increased so slowly? The reason is that science is too underdeveloped and medicine is too unscientific. Moreover, the position of midwife, which clearly belongs to the field of obstetrics, is actually entrusted to ignorant midwives. Little do they know that this is related to the survival of two lives. It is extremely difficult for people without sufficient obstetric knowledge and experience to bear this responsibility. Chinese medicine does not pay attention to this, so how many innocent souls have died in childbirth? In this way, should the population rate be lowered? Those without medical knowledge think it is fate, but in fact it is directly related to the lack of obstetric knowledge of the midwives.</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese medicine has shown signs of development. Therefore, special attention has also been paid to the field of obstetrics. Several schools have been established in Shanghai to train specialized talents. However, obstetric textbooks are naturally very difficult to find in China, where medicine is underdeveloped. Reading foreign books will inevitably feel the inconvenience of the language. Mr. Yang, in view of this, collected his usual teaching materials and wrote these two specialized books on obstetrics. They describe in detail the normal and abnormal phenomena before and after pregnancy, as well as the techniques to be applied. Although it is a book that obstetricians must read, it is also knowledge that women and the general public should have, because childbirth is almost unavoidable for anyone. Does a husband not worry about the danger of his wife giving birth? With sufficient knowledge, precautions can be taken, and it is also related to the prosperity and decline of the nation. We should pay more attention to it.</p>
