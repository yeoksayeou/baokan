<p>查本埠江海關所搜獲之海羅英此爲第二次其第一次則在香港所獲先是意國郵船公司之海關達號輪從奧國開來上海船抵香港　尙在上月下旬輪内裝有從奧國曲禮亞司德ＴＲＩＥＳＴＥ上船運入上海之貨物四十九箱註明二十八箱由滬起餘往大連灣提卸分作三張提單其提單上書明爲葡萄乾與其他之食物經香港關員啓箱看騐乃發覺盡是嗎啡海羅英等毒物代價至巨至少須五六十萬元立即將此貨扣留係因提單上未註明提取客家乃無從知其購運者乃該輪由港到滬不意船中尙留下三箱未被港關搜到在抵滬後即被私購者提去然已受損不淺矣</p>
<p>二次在上海查出第二次由奧裝出大致發貨處尙未得到香港失風電也查二批貨運來滬與第一次相距不過半月二次裝來者計二十六箱（昨誤三十六箱）仍由君士坦丁轉運到華得其中分作兩批一爲二十箱一係六箱即交意郵船可爾狄蘭那號ＣＯＬＤＥＬＡＮＡ運申船尙在七號進口其經過香港時係在本月四號港關本欲扣提當時因時間不及迨關員上船欲查而輪已開出遂未能扣獲即發密電至滬命江海關注意迨至江海關派員往輪搜索而該貨業已提上公和祥碼頭棧房矣而兩批中有六箱已先由承辦者提去故祗得搜抄出二十箱其提單箱面仍書葡萄乾及經起視赫然大宗海羅英也而僅此二十箱中「已有二千二百個基羅之重量矣因提單無受貨人海關一面將此貨提存關棧一面追究私運人</p>
<p>三次昨日又運到第二批方由海關查去不意昨日意國公司又到克拉可維亞號一輪ＣＲＡＣＯＶＩＡ裝來貨物無多因其專誠搭客故僅有數百件進口貨不意各貨中又發見與上二次同樣裝箱同係君士坦丁轉來不具收貨人名之貨物四批計三十三箱共有三千五百五十九個基羅此貨到滬意郵公司首先發覺已令該輪將此來貨暫且提存公和祥棧並將提單等號碼檢出料江海關必然得知或將扣留開騐記者昨往叩詢時知此貨猶未經海關開騐也惟旣係原公司裝來箱中可預料其必係有毒物也</p>
<p>私運毒物之客家此次私運來滬之大批毒物總計連香港没收者有三批共一百十一箱内中被提去計九箱總共重量三批有二萬另六百六十五個基羅在奧國裝出時代爲報運者係ＴＲＡＮＳＰＯＲＴＬＮＴＥＲＮＡＴＩＬＮＡＵＸ公司而上海方面提取者據記者調查所得似爲某國人因兩次先來提去九箱均係用ＭＥＩＳＨＬＣＯ名義此似某國商行名稱而地址則不詳也至於昨日第三次運來之三十三箱上有書葡萄乾有書ＣＬＡＮＳＩＮＧＭＡＴＥＲＩＡＬ其三十三箱中注明有十九箱須轉到天津大連兩埠綜計三批海羅英其代價至少在一百二三十萬元此誠近來大批毒品流入上海之最巨額也</p>

<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>第十八九期</p>
<p>前鋒周報這兩期的内容除湯冰若的民族主義的詩歌論爭波譯的兩個孤兒續稿外尙有襄華的血跡（隨筆）管理的安金姑娘（創作）錦軒的書報批評兩篇（一）小說月報七月號（二）前鋒月刋創刋號與及錦軒的談鋒「没有」這都是不可多得的力作在這樣的一個小刋物上能夠談到異常精密的文藝理論與創作眞可算是難能可貴别開生面的了現在以文藝的眼光將它分析一個大槪於下</p>
<p>冠在兩期之前的「民族主義文藝詩歌論」在形式上看來還是未曾刋完的長篇巨論但是我們讀了這兩段已深深地知道作者這篇文章的立論正確與及内容的充實了作者在民族主義的詩歌底意義裏是對於此項诗歌更有詳盡的分析與解說即如他在開首便這樣的說「我們可以知道民族主義的詩歌在中國的最古代已經包孕着豐滿的肧胎並不是提倡民族主義文藝運動的現今始而在事實上我們知道無論那一種文藝思潮的發生都有它底悠久的歷史背景和現社會客觀環境的需要成爲最高藝術表現的詩歌它在原始時代已極富有民族的意識即目前的中國受着帝國主義雙重的壓迫民族萎蘼至於斯極由着客觀的要求民族主義的詩歌是必然地應該應運而生了」像這樣一類具有深刻見解的話的確是有偉大的意義但是每一句一字都根據着史的事實决非其它的空論可比擬的其次是臚列古今中外各派的對於诗歌的認識同時在每一家所下的定義之後加以槪括的解說並且用了民族主義的觀點來作嚴正的批判最後是綜合起對於民族主義的詩歌底意義而取得明確的昭示確定了民族主義的詩歌應具的幾種要素（甲）民族底一般的意識（乙）促使民族向上發展的一般的思想（丙）民族的民間實際的生活（丁）自由韻律的原則作者所精密地所提出的這四點雖然不能算是什麽確定的定義但是民族主義的詩歌應具的條件却已給我們解答了</p>
<p>其次是述民族主義的詩歌内容作者也是根據詩歌中重要的原素而加以詳盡的說明如思想（Thought）感情（Emotion）想像（Imagination）等在民族主義的詩歌底内容上最重要的當然是思想所以作者在說「詩歌的内容最重要的當然是思想但是表現民族主義的詩歌對於一切阻礙民族向上進展的思想尤其是所謂那些不正確的普羅意識都在應該排除的一例此外如出世思想宗敎思想感傷思想頽廢思想浪漫思想封建思想等等統不該把文裝入我們的詩歌裏」我們祗須看這一小節所論思想方面的便能明白作者以下關於情緖與想像方面底發揮了最末作者述民族主義詩歌的内容是三種東西所構成的（一）民族主義的中心思想（二）民族意識的感情這裏又分爲二種（甲）社會的情緖（Social　Emotion）（乙）民族的情操（National　Sentiment）（三）民族主義的創造的想像這確是一篇民族主義詩歌的基本的重要的巨論</p>
<p>襄華的隨筆「血跡」却充滿了深沉的詩意作者的藝術手腕是異常的幽默在簡短的文字中實給予我們無上的深味内容是描寫友人所贈送的一張圖囑他（指作者自己）珍貴地保存着因爲這是我們先進者遺留下的戰績所蓄之意作者在此便已向我們告詔了但是以下所寫是有許多精采的獨到之處含有無限的深意眞使我們咀嚼着美味的橄欖一樣讀過此文之後自然而然地憶起了我們先進者遺留下來的戰績一血跡</p>
<p>「先進者在含笑地向我招着手我踏着他們的血跡向着那堅固的堡壘衝去」</p>
<p>「我願在這鮮明的血跡圖上加上言麽一點」這是作者最後的描寫可以觀照全文所具所力量了眞的「血跡」是一篇極形幽默的隨筆</p>
<p>管理的短篇「安金姑娘」同樣的値得我們底重視在這一篇創作裏我們還可以看出民族主義文藝底題材已探取到其它被壓迫民族的社會層裏實際這也是給予曲解侮蔑盲駡與不懂得文藝思潮的人一種重要的解釋這當然比用基礎理論來解釋還明白些</p>
<p>安金姑娘是個朝鮮被壓迫民族的女性年紀並不大約模念二三歲的光景但是好反抗日帝國主義者而努力於民族運動却有十年之久同時她底父母親的慘死更是使她加緊於民族運動的速率結果終於在喚發着鼓舞歌聲中而與可憐的朝鮮民衆長辭了作者描寫的手腕很强一枝生花的筆專集中於安金姑娘一人的身上所以她被那班日帝國主義者很迅速的拖到屠塲上的時候還刻畫着她所暴發的强有力的呼聲「起來被壓迫的民族轉結起來朝鮮的民族…」槪括地說像這種題材在我們中國實在非常的需要因爲我們中國民族也是被壓迫的全文很緊凑的確是一篇佳構</p>

<h3 id="c198">觀日本兒童畫展後所感 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 陳抱一</p>
<p>日前在吳淞路木村公司（美術用品文房具店）樓上舉行的「日本全國兒童優秀畫展覽會」我曾去看過兩次所陳列的作品以克來帕斯畫（詳後）蠟筆畫水彩爲主雖則在那狹小的展覽會場裏在不甚妥善的陳列之中那些由幼嫩的心和手所作成的畫確也大大地激發了我的興味同時也得以窺見近年日本小學兒童藝術觀念發達之點</p>
<p>原來這個展覽會在日本已曾開過這是第四回全國兒童畫展覽會乃由王樣商會及櫻商會所主開的每年徵集全國兒童的作品舉行爲常例</p>
<p>這次的作品在日本徵集了十二萬一千九百零五點中入選畫僅有一千六百點其選擇之嚴也可以見到這回運來上海舉行的只屬一部分是僅在一千餘點之中所選取的一百二十三點而已這次是原爲使在上海的日本兒童得有比較研究其國内兒童畫的成績之機會起見故特運來展覽的</p>
<p>雖則是兒童畫他們對於鑑查上之處理却是異常愼重故審查上是堂堂委託美術界及圖畫敎育界一流名家從事</p>
<p>審查員即山本鼎中川紀元石井柏亭足立源一郎木村莊八鍋井克之原田隆諦作井彌三郎山形寛大竹拙三石川寅治板倉贊治横井曹一郎板垣繁樹佐籐平太郎諸氏</p>
<p>而且每一幀作品下附有標紙上面見有各審查員的蓋章並於優秀作上都寫上審查員的感想或批語以示其審查之責任主開團體於作品中之優秀者都給與相當的賞贈以資奬勵的</p>
<p>兒童畫展近年在日本時常見有舉行主開者是各方面都有敎育界自身以外如新聞社及其他文化團體都熱心地幹着據說單是王樣商會（圖畫用品的公司）最近已曾徵集過二十三萬點以上的兒童畫只此一層也足窺見其情形的旺盛</p>
<p>却說我在這次畫展所見的多是克來帕斯畫蠟筆畫水彩畫等全部之中優作繁多這里不能一一細錄只能叙述其大體傾向</p>
<p>雖則是小學生的成績然而却是天眞爛漫地明澈地表現出來的「兒童世界的展示」有描寫運動會的有小朋友的遊戲有兵隊的行列有街上所見的景象有村莊四園的風物有家庭中的人物和生活學校的情景雪村的景色市道建築花菓等等題材都是用極自由的描法以很明麗的色彩一鮮黃色赤色碧藍濃綠茶褐色桃紅色黑白作品很有變化的色調而鮮明地表出他們的世界的印象尤其見得他們小小的手腕所巧妙地運用出來的克來帕斯畫獨特的描法是非常有趣</p>
<p>「克來帕斯」一乃日本近年間所創製的一種顏料筆其性質並有「彩色蠟筆」及「帕斯推爾」（彩色粉筆）兩種東西的特長也可說是近科固形的油畫顏料的一種東西形如帕斯推爾圓管狀用法自由便利却勝於從來的色鉛筆及蠟筆等這種克來帕斯可作出如下的幾種效果一</p>
<p>裕潤的線條</p>
<p>濃淡隨意的渾化</p>
<p>自由的混色</p>
<p>暗色上面可加上明色</p>
<p>又可以松節油等相和調開而作出種種雜多的色調</p>
<p>這次所見的畫中有些是在濃厚地塗出的克來帕斯色上面刮鏤出細線作成花紋的這我覺得於圖案或裝飾的描寫上却顯出異常趣緻的效果</p>
<p>綜觀這次的日本兒童畫有幾點很使我嘆賞的便是其印象之鮮明的表現直接根據兒童自身的觀感而自由地表現的題材於表現手法的驅運上的「自由」和「饒裕」之點這確可證明近年日本小學圖畫敎育之進步</p>
<p>但是其所以能趨於這傾向而發達過來的並非無故推究其原似乎不得不回溯到十年前洋畫家山本鼎氏所提倡「自由畫運動」了</p>
<p>原來當時日本各小學校所行的仍是範本敎育小學生習圖畫都照着範本臨摹其實這方法只能使兒童死練筆技而不能啓發兒童對於「自然」表現的觀感其中雖則也間有寫生的課程然是依據從來的呆板的敎法至多能照模範描到十足而却不能使照兒童自身的觀感個性的地所創作上有所發表山本氏當時痛切地指摘了種種弊病而極力唱導改革的運動一時共鳴者固有許多反對者也示其相當的聲勢當時敎育界中頗惹起種種議論然究竟這事是關於藝術敎育前途的死活問題的故他們不辭勞苦力排困難而册本氏曾寫一長文對於諸反對者一一加以明透的辯駁當時與片上伸岸邊福雄北原白秋長原孝太郎谷好夫金井正山越　去藏等諸氏組織了「日本兒童自由畫協會」後來又發行了「藝術自由敎育」的雜誌力圖於兒童藝術研究的方法上加以革新當時反響的地諸大新聞社都給與異常的聲援並在各方舉行展覽會以促進這運動</p>
<p>最初試行的「自由畫展覽會」是在大正八年（即一九一九年）四月開於山本氏的故鄉小縣郡神州村神川小學校未久南北信州東京丹波九州大阪等各地都連續地由共鳴者開了好幾個展覽會當時東京日日新聞社主開了一日本兒童自由畫展覽會」隨後大阪朝日新聞社也主開了「世界兒童自由畫展覽會」而且朝日新聞社利用夏期的講學曾在日本全國共三十五處實行展覽演講而努力宣傳其美好的意旨這是當時的情形」</p>
<p>不到幾年這個現實已在日本全國小學敎育上自然地發現起來了以來都常見有兒童自畫展的舉行但現在這「自由畫」三字似乎已無須說到而人們都知道要啓發兒童的藝術觀感這方法是純正而合理的了</p>
<p>看到現在他們的成績也便不能不想到山本鼎氏的功績這事雖有許多人不甚注意然於兒童的藝術敎育上已給與很大的貢獻這是未可否定的山本氏原是美術家而不是小學的辕畫敎員但關於這事即圖畫敎育的改革上他確是一個先覺者一面洋畫發達得有良好影響給與小學的藝術敎育於此也可以窺見</p>
<p>這里試錄當時山本鼎氏提倡「自由畫」的趣意書（大正侂年三月下旬）之一部分</p>
<p>從來在各小學間所行的兒童繪畫敎育大抵是「臨畫」和「寫生」兩種方法這里我所謂「自由畫」的是指包含寫生記憶想像等而言就是不藉臨本而却要兒童直接的表現</p>
<p>據從來的敎導看來兒童模寫那種經過粗劣印刷的大人畫之時間却比之直接從「自然」吸取形或色彩的時間更多這我以爲是不對的何以故因爲譬如臨本上所表着的一條無意味的線却會如同一條美而活的樹木之線一樣的力量發生作用於兒童的頭腦裏的緣故他們無論什麽理西都會去正直地模倣的」所以若把萎枯的臨本給他們模寫則兒童的眼和手也將會變成一樣的萎枯了若誘導兒童的眼目朝向豐富的「自然界」則他們的心和手自會活潑起來的這只要看學齡期前的兒童的圖畫大槪都是活躍生動的也很能證明這事</p>
<p>要之在兒童的繪畫上要奬勵使有如大人一樣的觀照力却是誤謬對於兒童非得使其開放不可尤其於美術上的敎養前應得如此</p>
<p>「美」若只賴師傳的培植是終會墮落的從那種似乎　臨本粉本所　成的舊式的美術家手中把將來的日本美術及美術工藝全然收回却是我們的任務究竟在小學校裏與算術地理等一共敎授文章繪畫音樂的是爲着什麽</p>
<p>一這可不待言的乃是爲要與知識一並涵養高尙的有如人然的「美」之情操起見假如人類都有着强悍的體力明快的容貌充分的智識和適應的事業豈不是顯赫的現象嗎兼且假如無論誰何更於其情致上都是詩人是美術家是音樂家那就眞是天國了這樣的天國雖則在今日我們當中有如「痴人之夢」但是却也没有一個人寗願向着反對的方面走去的這好比無論什麽人都不情願走向貧窮方面的一樣</p>
<p>要之人是不絶地在欲求着「產生」和「育成」於這兩者極其順潮地進展之處不得不感到得以建設健實的文化</p>
<p>我志在使我們的美術及美術上藝成爲最順潮的東西而感到這事眞的非從兒童的繪畫敎育起始不可</p>
<p>如前面所述的一般我以爲非得把大人專抄粉本兒童專摹臨本的弊風一掃不可與其把臨本給兒童模倣總</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>不如自由地放牧於「自然」而非使他們產生不可這事在大人也自會感到興味在兒童却也有意義的兒童們在與「自然」相對之間大約一面直接創出繪畫一面會獨自領略到「美」吧「美」委實是這樣性質的東西猶如性慾不給與臨本也自會於少年的胸膛裏暗示着的一樣這却是自然的機密是深邃的神明的智慧」（下略）</p>
<p>此外尙有種種關於自由畫敎育的文獻有一篇山本氏的「自由畫敎育之要點」說得異常明澈當於下次的機會再行介紹</p>
<p>至於近年我國小學圖畫敎育的成績如何這事我自然不能有確實的判斷因爲也從未加以研究</p>
<p>但關於這方面的情形也可以根據曾經見過多少小學生的圖畫成績並據直接在敎授小學生的友人所傳來的關於小學圖畫課的情形又二三年前我曾在某大學的附屬中學担任過幾個月的圖畫敎課因而也可以推知近年圖畫成績之一面據這情形看則知道我國多數小學依然是臨臨範本敷衍着一二小書而且學校對於這課程似乎很不注重又因爲所制定的時間及設備上敎授上等關係似乎不能使學生感到有什麽興味</p>
<p>據我所直接看見的那附屬中學的圖畫課情形而說那中學雖然也備有幾具石膏像模型但也很奇怪却没有一間圖畫敎室學生方面對於極簡單的寫生尙且從未有過一些修養問題他們以前在所經過的學校裏如何習畫的他們說以前先生只敎我們臨臨範本或敎我們抄摹一些雜誌上所截下來的圖畫而已他們只有如此的經騐故在每星期内一時間的圖畫課要他們從新習起寫生來倒是很不容易便在學生方面也愈到異常困難而對着實物便無從下手了其中曾有一個看見寫生的實物而說「這樣敎我們怎樣畫先生何不在黑板上畫出來等我們照樣臨摹」這話除了表明他在小學以來的模倣習性之外没有别的我也並不覺爲特異因爲他們在小學以前的預備中確也未曾有過圖畫敎課上有益的訓練有的只是敷衍一二小時的臨摹而已故他們非據有臨畫帖便一些都繪不成了這種習慣似乎是普遍着在我國的小學裏這原也不足怪因爲多數小學對於圖畫課程也似乎是照例排出至於爲什麽要啓發兒童的「美的觀感」如何去啓發他們對於美的觀感之表現似乎他們從未考慮及的也似乎還本知道這考慮之必要所以許多學生對於這課程也隨便敷衍而已而學校當局者對於無論如何情形都不加以批評而以爲就是通信一般的情形</p>
<p>本來學校的圖畫課目的固不在養成兒童爲專門的藝術家而設的其宗旨無非在啓發兒童的「美的觀感」也就是要使他們對於現象咸形色的美的眼和心醒悟起來使他們照着各自的觀感去感悟去表現以誘發其「創造的心情」而已這原不是要去養成爲畫家的</p>
<p>雖然如此但是臨本敎法究竟對於這目的能發生多少效力我以爲臨本只能無條件地使兒童描摹一些筆跡而其形象並不是從描摹者的兒童自己的興味發出的東西無論如何描摹得好（或像）也不足證明是兒童自身美的觀感中的經騐大約他也發見不出一些是他自己所觀感的東西故些毫都表露不出他對於現象觀感的情緖故臨摹只能使學生習染起模倣的根性而不能使學生發生創造的嘗試力所以這里便有圖畫範本不能充作辕畫敎導的理由良好的圖畫範本至多也只能充作學生的參考而不可直拿來給學生臨摹的</p>
<p>兒童自有兒童的感情和觀察敎授者只可善導的給與指示和說明而使其觀感力得以啓發而不可使其盲從敎師或範本的作品總之直接去試練而啓發學生的觀感力便是使學生把握到一種力量的故直接對着實物（或實在的現象）使其依照自己的觀感自由地描寫便是使這種力量自然而擴大的</p>
<p>這方法並非在奬勵他們的描寫趨於怪異而要之在啓發他們個自所有的觀感力非使其自然地照着純情去表現不可</p>
<p>我國的中小學間大約也有若干對於圖畫課也眞實地處理的學校但似乎只屬僅少之數從來我國的敎育者多數對於圖畫一課都認爲可有可無的東西故成績如何似乎更不是他們所欲問的而且也有許多人看見兒童繪畫便只認爲消耗時間而不想到繪畫的修習於兒童的美的觀感上有何等重大關係這些情形也因爲我國的敎育界對於「藝術敎育」一事還未以誠心去注意的原故我很希望直接在圖畫敎育上努力的諸位今後於這方面加以革新以使其發達</p>
<p>末了附帶的預告一段消息就是最近上海日本人方面也鑒於在上海的兒童缺乏藝術的環和涵養特爲鼓吹他們繪畫創作起見現由「上海每日新聞社主開「全上海兒童自由畫展覽會」定本月（十一月）十五十六兩日於該社（吳淞路北首湯恩路角）樓上會堂舉行第一回展（收集作品自五日起十日截止審查由日本畫家小川安東氏等担任）其成績固未可預料但我希望注意兒童藝術敎育的人們都可以在這機會得到一些參考</p>

<h3 id="e4">Review Committee Meeting Details <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The five review committees held meetings at the Central Party Headquarters at 2:00 PM on the 13th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Education Group had all review committee members present. Chairman Li Shizeng submitted the five proposals of this group for review one by one. The review was completed at around 5:00 PM, and a report has been submitted to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>All members of the Party Affairs Group were present. Chairman Ye Chucang merged and reviewed the sixteen proposals of this group. However, due to the large number of proposals and the complex content, the review could not be completed until 5:30 PM. The meeting was adjourned, and it was decided to continue the review after the General Assembly tomorrow.</p>
<p>All review committee members of the Military Affairs Group were present. Chairman He Yingqin merged and reviewed the four proposals. The review was completed at around 5:00 PM. Due to insufficient time, two-thirds of the proposals will be reviewed again after the General Assembly on the 14th.</p>
<p>All review committee members of the Political Group were present. Chairman Wang Chonghui had a total of twenty-seven proposals, among which Chiang Kai-shek's proposal for political reform was the most important.

The review results will be reported to the General Assembly for discussion at the second General Assembly on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<p>All members of the Economic Construction Group were present, except for Wu Tiecheng, who could not attend due to the simultaneous review of the Political Group. Chairman Sun Ke had a total of nine proposals in this group. The merged review was adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

<h3 id="e5">Second General Assembly This Morning <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The General Assembly Secretariat notified all committee members at 13:00 on the 13th that the second General Assembly would be held at 8:00 AM on the 14th, and the afternoon would still be for review meetings. At the same time, all committee members were notified that, as instructed by the Presidium, all original proposals and review reports on Party Affairs and Politics would not be published before they had been discussed and decided by the General Assembly, and all committee members were instructed to pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Key Points of the Central Standing Committee's Proposals <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(A) Proposal to Establish the Party Members' Work Objectives during the Tutelage Period: 1. Tutelage is the Party's greatest mission from now on, and all work of the Party must be aimed at completing tutelage. 2. In order to achieve the goal of completing tutelage, the specific work of Party departments at all levels must proceed according to the following guidelines: 1. It is necessary to foster the Party's foundation in various social undertakings and organizations in order to enhance the people's knowledge and ability to use the four powers and develop various social undertakings. 2. It is necessary to integrate the Party's doctrine with all educational undertakings in the country in order to guide the youth of the country on the path of the Three Principles of the People. 3. It is necessary to effectively publicize, guide, and urge local people to engage in local self-government in order to establish the foundation of democratic politics. 3. The methods of carrying out the above-mentioned guidelines will be detailed by the Central Executive Committee with reference to the Plan for Party Affairs during the Tutelage Period as resolved by the Second Plenary Session, the Plan for Promoting Party Affairs as resolved by the Third Plenary Session, and the Plan for Party Affairs during the Tutelage Period. (B) Proposal to Amend the Internal Organization of Provincial, County, and Municipal Party Departments: Regarding the changes in the organization of provincial, municipal, and county Party departments, it is necessary to concentrate will and promote Party affairs. The principles are as follows: 1. Unify the power to decide and command Party affairs in order to tighten its organization, strengthen its power, and avoid as much as possible all forms and procedures used by political organs. 2. All sections of affairs should carry out their work under unified command in order to avoid the situation of decentralization due to division of labor and the isolation of people due to decentralization of power. 3. The appointment and deployment of staff must be able to adapt to the needs of reducing paperwork and focusing on practical work. (C) Standards for the Reorganization of Local Party Affairs: 1. For formally established provincial and municipal Party departments, the Central Government will send personnel to conduct assessments. The assessment standards are whether the subordinate Party departments of the provincial and municipal Party departments are well-organized, whether the work is practical, whether the Party members' thinking is pure, and whether they can implement the Central Government's orders and work hard on the work stipulated by the Central Government. Reorganization measures will be determined according to the circumstances. 2. For provincial and municipal Party departments that have not been established, but whose functions are exercised by the Guidance Committee or the Reorganization Committee, all departments will be suspended, and the Central Government will send preparatory committee members to guide the preparation in districts, and a deadline will be set for the establishment of formal Party departments. It is also stipulated that anyone who serves on the preparatory committee shall not be elected as a member of the formal Party department in order to correct the past abuses of using power to compete in elections. 3. For county or district Party departments that have been formally established, the preparatory committee will assess their work performance and decide whether to reorganize or change their organization. (D) Proposal for the Reform of the Party's Finances: It is advocated that the Party's finances should be based on the principle of taking from Party members and using for the society, and to correct past wastefulness. 1. Immediately abolish all taxes levied in the name of Party fees. 2. Gradually remove the expenditures listed as Party fees in the central, provincial, and county budgets. 3. Revise the methods of subsidies from higher-level Party departments to lower-level Party departments, and determine that performance is the standard. 4. Strive to be frugal in the Party's internal expenses and expand business expenses. As for the sources of Party fees, it is planned that: 1. Central Party fees will be charged from the income of personnel in various institutions directly under the Central Government. 2. Provincial Party department expenses will be charged from the income of personnel in the provincial government and its subordinate institutions. 3. County Party department expenses will be charged from the income of personnel in various institutions under the county government and one-quarter of the income of all Party members in the county, and will be subsidized by the provincial Party department based on performance. 4. District Party department expenses will be charged from one-quarter of the income of all Party members in the district. 5. District branch expenses will be charged from one-quarter of the income of Party members and stamp fees. 6. The business expenses of special Party departments will be subsidized by the Central Government based on performance. 7.

<h3 id="e8">The Strange Disaster in Lyon, France <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>France is known as a land of pleasure in Europe. Except for the previous man-made European War, which caused turmoil, natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and earthquakes are rarely heard of. This time, due to heavy rain, there was a tragedy of collapsed houses and land subsidence, with more than 100 deaths. The disaster victims being taken in filled the pits and valleys. This is truly unexpected by the French people and is one of the natural changes in the world.</p>
<p>France suffered greater losses on the ground during the European War than other countries. Therefore, since the European War, its voice in the peace conference has been stronger than other countries, and it has also received more reparations than other countries. This is because it is reasonable to compensate for its actual losses. However, from today's situation, the war resulted in many deaths and injuries and a decrease in population. The reparations received were used to restore the areas destroyed during the war. There is work to be done domestically, and the number of unemployed people is less than in any industrial country. This is indeed a rare opportunity for misfortune to turn into a blessing for the world. Now, the harm of a rare natural disaster has been discovered again. Although it is not very large and does not damage the overall situation, it is also unexpected by the French people.</p>
<p>The changes in human affairs have reached their extreme today, not only in one continent or one country, but almost all over the world. However, the changes in nature on the earth often deviate from the norm, and there are many things that people cannot predict. Is this the so-called way of interaction between heaven and man?</p>
<h3 id="e9">Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>He submitted eleven proposals: (1) To reorganize lower-level Party departments. (2) To strictly prohibit the incorporation of bandits and promote Party indoctrination to enlighten those who have been misled into the Communist Party. (3) To concentrate talents and strengthen central cadres for construction. (4) To allocate national taxes and issue large-scale relief bonds to help disaster areas in various provinces. (5) To reorganize field taxes, it is necessary to first implement land surveys and correct taxes. (6) To reduce the property tax on domestic goods to enrich the people's livelihood. (7) To implement the allocation of autonomous funds to prepare for local autonomy. (8) To establish a Yellow River guidance plan and raise special funds for implementation in order to promote water conservancy. (9) To issue a nationwide order to register barren mountains and wastelands and stipulate afforestation deadlines. (10) To complete the Longhai Railway and extend it to Qinghai and Xinjiang to facilitate transportation and strengthen the border. (11) To establish a special Yellow River Basin forestry directorate to manage river control and afforestation, increase production, and prevent floods. Yangfu submitted two proposals: (1) To reorganize Party affairs. (2) To implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session and previous central resolutions, with the Central Supervisory Committee responsible for strict supervision. The Central Standing Committee submitted four proposals: (1) To establish the Party's work standards during the tutelage period. (2) To revise the internal organization of provincial, municipal, and county Party departments. (3) Standards for the reorganization of local Party departments. (4) The Party's financial budget. Cai Yuanpei submitted one proposal: To issue 10 million yuan of educational and cultural construction bonds guaranteed by the interest of the British Boxer Indemnity and the balance of the Russian Boxer Indemnity in order to establish a foundation for tutelage. Zhu Jiahua, Dai Chuanxian, Li Shizeng, and Wu Jingheng jointly signed the above proposals. The above proposals have been compiled by the Secretariat and divided into five categories: Party affairs, politics, military affairs, education, and economic construction, totaling sixteen cases in Party affairs, twenty-seven cases in politics, five cases in military affairs, five cases in education, and nine cases in economic construction. As of the evening of the 13th, there were a total of sixty-two proposals. In addition, there were twelve proposals from Party departments at all levels and five letters of opinion, all of which have been compiled into huge volumes and distributed to each committee for review and consolidation before being submitted to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Proposal for Designating Embassy Addresses <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting submitted a proposal to the General Assembly to have the government designate multiple unconnected addresses in the capital city for various countries to build embassies. The general idea is that the National Government has been based in Nanjing for more than three years, and many embassies are still staying in Beiping. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged them to move, most of them are still waiting and watching. Their excuse for not moving south is that it is difficult to find houses or that the facilities are incomplete. In order to eliminate this excuse, it is requested that multiple addresses be designated, each designated for one country to build an embassy. Once construction begins, completion can be expected, and the excuse of difficulty in finding houses will be difficult to justify. Road lines should be designated near each address to develop transportation, and all modern material conveniences should be provided as much as possible. In this way, even if the embassies want to stay in Beiping, they will have no excuse to refuse. However, when designating addresses, they should be separated and not connected. After the above methods are prepared, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will notify the embassies of various countries to move to Beijing. All old embassies in Beiping will be fairly valued by our country, and either cash or bonds will be issued for complete recovery and allocated for use as school buildings. The governments of various countries can also use the funds they receive to build new embassies in the capital.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Proposal for Educational and Cultural Bonds <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Jiahua, Dai Chuanxian, Li Shizeng, Wu Jingheng, and others proposed to the General Assembly to issue 10 million yuan of educational and cultural construction bonds guaranteed by the interest of the British Boxer Indemnity and the balance of the Russian Boxer Indemnity in order to establish a foundation for tutelage. The original text is as follows: It is secretly investigated that education and culture are the foundation of a country, and scientific research is the foundation of all undertakings. The Prime Minister of our Party introduced the theory of knowing is difficult and acting is easy to the world, and was finally able to realize the national revolution. Now that the national military has ended and tutelage has begun, all constructions related to the national economy and people's livelihood should be carried out in order, and the training of specialized talents and the strengthening of research institutions are particularly urgent. In recent years, universities and research institutes in various countries have been affected by military affairs, and all expenses have been difficult. Coupled with the trend of high gold and low silver, the cost of all imported books, instruments, and building materials has increased by about 50%. Even if the budgeted funds can be obtained, considering the price of gold, it is equivalent to a 60% discount. Therefore, although the call for domestic construction is high, schools and research institutions are showing signs of depression and distress. If you do not seek true knowledge, how can you come to reality? At the beginning of this tutelage construction, it seems that we should carefully plan construction funds for universities and research institutes in various countries to promote the application of science and the training of experts, so that the foundation of tutelage can be established. According to the Prime Minister's instructions and the Party's platform, the Boxer Indemnities returned by various countries should be allocated as educational funds. Apart from the specially designated uses, the Russian and British Indemnities have an annual surplus of about 6 million yuan for the Russian Indemnity and an annual amount of at least 2 million yuan for the first batch of the British Indemnity allocated for railway construction, assuming a minimum interest rate of 5%. It is now proposed to draw 5 million yuan of cash from the above two indemnities each year to guarantee the issuance of 10 million yuan of educational and cultural construction bonds, which can be fully repaid within three years. This bond will be used exclusively to subsidize national universities and research institutes for the purchase of books, instruments, and the construction of houses and buildings. The issuance of bonds and the management of funds will still be presided over by the Ministry of Finance. The distribution of bonds will be undertaken by a committee organized by the Ministry of Education. In this way, the burden on the national treasury will not increase, and universities and research institutions can have considerable construction and development in the shortest possible time. The plan for cultivating people and encouraging learning for a hundred years must be renewed in the eyes and ears of the world. Is it appropriate to respectfully request a public decision?</p>
<h3 id="e12">Wu Chaoshu's Two Proposals <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Wu Chaoshu proposed two proposals to the General Assembly: One is a proposal to convene a National Assembly, stating that convening a National Assembly is what the Prime Minister urged. Now that the military has ended and tutelage has begun, it should be held as soon as possible to establish the foundation of national politics. The second is a proposal to reduce the size of provinces and regions, stating that the provinces of our country are vast, transportation is obstructed, local customs are different, and the views of different regions are very deep, which is conducive to the military's division. Therefore, it is requested to reduce the area, dividing each province into two or three provinces. The French Revolution changed forty provinces into eighty-seven states, which is an example.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Proposal to Reorganize the National Army <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>He Chengjun proposed the Proposal to Reorganize the National Army. It is secretly maintained that the number of soldiers is too large, and without reorganization, it is impossible to seek sufficient military expenditure and eliminate internal strife before it sprouts. Military discipline is chaotic, and without reorganization, it is impossible to become an elite army to bear the heavy responsibility of national defense. The Reorganization Conference in the 17th year became Feng Yan Li Bai and other rebellious subordinates who nominally obeyed but secretly disobeyed. Therefore, at that time, in addition to the disbandment of more than 200,000 troops directly under the central government, the remaining groups not only did not eliminate a single soldier, but secretly increased recruitment, which led to frequent rebellions and heavily burdened the central government's suppression. Now that the great chaos has been suppressed and the rebellious troops have been disintegrated one after another, in terms of the current number of soldiers, there is no need to specifically talk about reorganization. However, the military system has not been unified, and the strength, weakness, good, and bad of its contents vary. Moreover, after a long period of war, education, discipline, management, hygiene, etc. are particularly lax. In terms of reorganization, there is a real need for urgency. Although internal strife has been suppressed, border defense is still urgent, so we must also consider both. I humbly present the following points within my humble vision: 1. The titles of wartime commander-in-chief and army commander should be abolished uniformly, and the division commander should be changed to a specially appointed position. 2. The performance of each division should be examined, and the weak should be eliminated and the strong retained. 3. Personnel should be sent to verify each division and a clear order should be issued prohibiting recruitment. 4. The funds for each division should be determined and issued by name every month. 5. Find a way to place the dismissed generals. 6. Reorganize clothing and food factories. 7. Expand ordnance factories. 8. Rectify military discipline to achieve cooperation between the military and the people. If the above articles are approved, please order the government to organize a National Army Reorganization Committee and at the same time order the abolition of the Reorganization Conference to unify opinions and facilitate implementation. The Reorganization Committee should be composed of the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, the Chief of the General Staff, the Director-General of Training, the President of the Military Advisory Council, and specially appointed government officials.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Proposal to Relieve Disaster Areas in Various Provinces <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed to allocate national taxes and issue treasury bonds and relief bonds to relieve disaster areas in various provinces. It is investigated that the duration of the rebellion and the involvement of local communists, the depth of the damage, the magnitude of the losses, and the extent of the disaster area are unprecedented in history. Now, the remaining people are crying for food. We should consider the severity of the disaster in each province and region and either allocate national taxes or issue large-scale relief bonds, with the central government designating a fund and stipulating methods. The purpose is to use half for relief to comfort the victims and half for post-disaster reconstruction needs in order to achieve practical results and eliminate the people's suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Key Points of the Proposal to Reorganize Military and Political Affairs <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu proposed the Key Points of the Proposal to Reorganize Military and Political Affairs as follows: (1) Abolish the wartime military group organization and the titles of commander-in-chief and army commander. (2) The division should be the highest unit of the national army. The existing divisions and teams directly under the central government's jurisdiction and supply should be merged, streamlined, rectified, and strengthened. (3) Determine the organization of the division, eliminate various attached units and titles outside the organization. (4 Establish reserve officers).</p>
<p>Transfer and train the dismissed ignorant people and active military officers in rotation. (5) Preferential treatment should be given to the old and weak officers and soldiers for their retirement and lifelong support. (6 Military needs are independent). (7) Delineate military regions. (8) Implement relocation, transfer, exchange of jurisdiction. (9) Military officers should not hold political positions concurrently.</p>

The pirates used their old trick of boarding the ship disguised as passengers in Swatow (Shantou). Upon a signal, they attacked the wheelhouse and engine room. The ship was undefended and the crew, caught off guard, were forced to obey. As the pirates rushed towards the wheelhouse, a Chinese waiter happened to come out of the kitchen and was shot, but not seriously injured. The pirates then forced the crew to steer the ship to English Hai and Mills Bay. Upon arriving at the destination last night, they searched the crew and passengers for valuables. At dawn, they took the loot ashore and kidnapped the head comprador and the third comprador for ransom. The Europeans on board consisted of only Captain Petterson and his wife and five other crew members. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Twenty-Two Houses Collapse; Over One Hundred Casualties</p>
<p>Paris, 13th (Agence Nationale) - A flood occurred in the city of Lyon today, collapsing twenty-two houses. The known death toll is eighty, but the total number of casualties is estimated to be over one hundred. In recent days, Lyon has experienced continuous heavy rain, and residents have been fearful of the Rhone and Saône rivers overflowing. As expected, at 1:00 AM this morning, the river water collapsed a surrounding wall and came crashing down like a landslide. Houses and livestock were unable to escape in time and were swept away and drowned. Cries for help arose everywhere, and warnings were issued continuously. The police force rushed to the scene and tried their best to block the flood. While rescue work was underway, landslides suddenly occurred, and twenty-two houses collapsed instantly. Twelve firefighters, seventeen police officers, and two doctors at the scene were tragically crushed to death. Troops stationed throughout the city have now been dispatched to the disaster area to try their best to prevent the disaster from spreading, and to assist nearby residents in relocating to temporary shelters. Churches and schools are sheltering the displaced people, who are overflowing with crying women and wailing children, which is unbearable to witness. Some say that the tragic scenes of the European war have reappeared today.</p>
<p>Lyon, 13th (Reuters) - At 1:00 AM this morning, a wall collapsed on a street in this area. The fire department and police rushed to the rescue, but two more houses collapsed in succession, burying the rescuers under the rubble. It is reported that at least sixty people were killed and forty injured. The exact numbers cannot be determined immediately. A subsequent dispatch stated that at least ten six- or seven-story residential buildings collapsed on a street in the Saint-Jean district of this town. At present, firefighters, police, and volunteers are risking their lives to rescue those buried. A subsequent dispatch stated that houses continued to collapse, and thirty bodies have been recovered so far. Except for five people, all of them were rescuers, including the fire chief and deputy chief, eighteen firefighters, and five police officers.</p>

<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - The British Prime Minister, as chairman of the Indian Round Table Conference, delivered an address stating that the people in attendance shoulder the responsibility of rewriting new history that is currently coming into existence. The British monarch and governing officials have repeatedly declared that Britain's work in India is solely to prepare India for self-government. Now we gather here to register in an agreement that India has reached the crucial points in its constitutional process, a fact that is acknowledged. However, differing opinions still need to be resolved, and conflicting interests have yet to be reconciled. This conference should resolve to address and overcome these difficulties, which is not impossible. Have we not encountered various difficulties in the growth and development of constitutional freedom? However, no matter the obstacles, we will ultimately unite. This is because we have the ability to reconcile differences through reasonable mutual forgiveness. We are now before the British monarch and should be aware of the strong and resilient chain that links the entire British Empire to a common oath of loyalty to the sovereign. The participation of representatives from the overseas dominions in this conference is proof that the sister nations of the British Empire will observe our work with goodwill and attention. The unprecedented gathering of the Indian princes and representatives of the people of British India is also a sign that India is gradually merging into a single entity. The representatives of British India, who come from different ethnic groups, religions, and interests, are well aware of this. However, they also remember the unifying forces that naturally arose after India's contact with Britain and the desire for a unified India held in the hearts of Indian philosophers and emperors before the first British merchant arrived in their territory. We sit around this table with the sole fixed purpose of enhancing India's position in the British Empire. This is a simple fact, and this alone is an undeniable sign of progress towards this goal. It is hoped that those in attendance will ensure that this conference is worthy of the British Empire's people's superior political talent.</p>
<p>Jamu and the King of Kashmir stated that the Indian princes, as allied states of the United Kingdom, deeply desire to be connected with Britain, and as Indians, deeply desire to enjoy honor and equality in the British Empire. The representative of Hyderabad, Haitari, stated that no one wants to sever the chain connecting the British monarch and the princes. At the same time, the princes are prepared to work with the people of British India in harmony to achieve the realization of a unified and great India. The Muslim representative, Jinnah, stated that India now hopes that the declaration of the Viceroy of India on October 31st, which stated that the natural result of India's constitutional progress would be the acquisition of dominion status, will become a reality and be implemented. We are very pleased that representatives from the overseas dominions have come to participate in this conference, as they are here today to witness the birth of a new dominion in the British Empire (the audience applauded loudly). The Burmese representative, Ba Bo, stated that he hopes that Burma will soon be an equal partner with other dominions in the British Empire.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Disarmament Conference Continues Debate on Limiting Land Warfare Equipment <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from Britain, France, and the United States Propose Draft</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (Agence Nationale) - After a long period of intense debate, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee's discussion on the issue of limiting land warfare equipment has been adjourned until Thursday for further deliberation. The Japanese representative Sato, the French representative Mai Sheni, and representatives from Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and other countries all opposed direct limitations. Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Soviet Russia supported direct limitations. The Soviet representative Litvinov also requested indirect limitations in the budget in addition to direct limitations.</p>
<p>Geneva, 13th (Reuters) - The Disarmament Committee resumed its discussion today on methods for setting land armament restrictions. Lord Cecil, on behalf of the British, French, and American delegations, put forward a draft in three parts. First, it supports the principle that all countries acceding to the current convention should exchange information on armaments as much as possible. Second, it records the committee's desire to seek a consistent method of limiting war materiel in a more definitive state than mere publication. Third, it recognizes the majority opinion of the committee that the most appropriate method of limiting land armaments is budgetary restrictions. Others believe that a more effective method is direct restrictions and categorization, and some advocate using both methods. After discussion, the committee verbally amended and adopted the first and second items, and decided to discuss the third item again on the 14th to allow British and German representatives to negotiate verbal amendments.</p>

<p>National Service Army Term Reduced to One Year; Total National Army Strength Planned at 520,000</p>
<p>Paris dispatch: The law, approved by the French Parliament the year before last (1928), to reduce the compulsory military service period for conscripts to twelve months has been implemented since November 1st of this year. This is the first such instance since the French Revolution. According to this law, the national army will be reduced by over ten thousand men. Since Germany was bound by the Treaty of Versailles to reduce its army, it has adopted a strategy of elite troops, based on the principle that a small number of well-trained soldiers can be rapidly mobilized and launched an attack. Former German Army Commander Seeckt once said that he believed this was the most suitable military strategy for future wars. French military authorities, recognizing Germany's success, decided to follow suit and began to reorganize the original army organization law on a trial basis. However, this aroused opposition from nationalist factions, who said that Germany's threat was becoming increasingly clear, while France was still talking about reducing its army, which was absurd. They did not understand that the authorities were reducing the size of the army without impairing its quality. The military budget in the 1931 budget increased by 75 million francs compared to the previous year, so although the number of personnel has decreased, the army's strength has only increased. The determination of French Minister of War Maginot to reform the system stemmed from the large-scale exercises held in the border regions of Germany and Italy in the summer and autumn of this year. The total number of people who participated in these exercises reached about 100,000, and it was deeply felt that the large number of people made command difficult and maneuverability inflexible, lacking the value of surprise in attack. Therefore, it was decided to reform the system. The budget for the number of soldiers serving one-year terms nationwide was reduced to 523,769, which is not much different from the 556,000 announced by Briand at the League of Nations in Geneva. Compared with the 810,000 at the outbreak of the Great War, this is a reduction of 41 percent. The organizational content is: conscripts (French) 240,000, North African native troops 95,000, other colonial native troops 84,000, and professional soldiers 16,000. According to Maginot's plan, 200,000 men are to be used as vanguard troops, and the remaining 300,000 men as rear defense troops. In addition, France has built numerous solid defense projects at the borders with Germany, Italy, Belgium, and other countries. Construction began two years ago and is expected to be completed within seven years, with a total cost of approximately 7 billion francs (approximately 70 million US dollars). National defense can be said to be extremely thorough, but opponents of a small army still maintain that German troops are actually stronger than French troops in terms of combat power. Although the peace treaty stipulates that only 100,000 troops are allowed to defend the eastern border, Germany's armed police force nationwide reaches 150,000, and they are well-trained and can be deployed for external operations at any time. France, on the other hand, only has 106,000 professional soldiers, and only 46,000 are stationed in France. As for conscripts, only 90,000 are combat-ready in a given period. Therefore, compared to Germany, it is only a ratio of 136,000 to 250,000. However, this reason is not sufficient, as most of the French soldiers stationed abroad are in North Africa, and it only takes two days to return to their homeland in case of emergency. Furthermore, French military authorities are paying close attention to the latest killing techniques using scientific methods. According to experts, France is still far behind Germany in this regard.

<h3 id="e68">Austrian Social Democratic Party Marches and Demonstrates to Celebrate Election Victory <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>National News, Vienna, December 12: More than 60,000 members of the Socialist Party held a large demonstration today on Lin Street, the most famous street in Vienna, to celebrate the victory of the Socialist Party in Sunday's general election. The Social Democratic Party, which had always held the second-largest number of seats in Parliament, has now risen to first place. Unfortunately, Major Pabst, the leader of the quasi-fascist Heimwehr organization, who had previously been expelled from Austria by the Austrian government, has now had this order rescinded by Internal Affairs Minister Steinhauser, the leader of the Heimwehr, and has returned from Italy, where he was warmly welcomed by the leaders of the group. The masses now fear that this matter will lead to serious developments, as Steinhauser had declared before the election that regardless of the outcome of the election, the Heimwehr would not give up the power it currently holds in the government.</p>

<p>Rival Factions Confront Each Other with Pistols</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, December 12: A riot broke out at the University of Berlin today, which was not quelled until the police intervened. Initially, Social Democratic students disagreed with leaflets distributed by the National Socialist Party. National Socialist students were greatly angered and, ignoring the advice of the principal, attacked students who appeared to be Jewish. Immediately, students from both the Social Democratic and National Socialist factions gathered in the open space on campus for a major battle, even firing several shots. As a result, many male students and one female student were injured. When the police arrived at the school and wielded batons, they were able to disperse the crowd, but shortly afterward, another conflict arose due to the refusal to release seven key members of the National Socialist Party who had been arrested.</p>

<p>National News, Oslo, December 12: It is officially confirmed that Norway has signed a treaty with Canada relinquishing sovereignty over the Sverdrup Islands. These islands, located west of Greenland, were discovered by Norwegian Sverdrup during the Second Fram Expedition. The treaty must be approved by Parliament, but the Norwegian Parliament is not expected to object, as Canada will still allow Norwegian whaling ships and fishing boats to use the islands as fishing grounds and will award Sverdrup, who is currently seriously ill, 30,000 yuan as compensation for his discovery.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Zhang Xueliang passed through Jinan early this morning (the 11th) amidst a grand welcome from all sectors. On the evening of the 10th, Jinan received a telegram from Tianjin stating that Zhang's special train departed from Tianjin in the afternoon, with a total of three trains. The first train was a guard train, which departed from Tianjin at 5:25 PM and was expected to arrive in Jinan at 4:30 AM on the 11th. The second train was Zhang's special train, which departed from Tianjin at 6:55 PM and was scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 6:30 AM on the 11th. The third train was a staff train, which departed from Tianjin at 7:30 PM on the 10th and was scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 6:30 AM on the 11th. All sectors immediately began preparing for the welcome. The train station and various government agencies were decorated with pine branches, and the entire city was hung with national flags and various welcome slogans. The pistol brigade, public security bureau, and security team were deployed around the station and nearby areas to provide security. All representatives from various sectors were not allowed to enter the station unless they held a temporary pass issued by the provincial government. From 3:00 AM this morning (the 11th), welcoming personnel began to arrive at the station in droves. By 5:00 AM, the provincial government chairman Han Fuqu, Central Committee member Ding Weifen, National Arts Museum Director Li Jinglin, Education Department Director He Siyuan, Construction Department Director Zhang Honglie, Finance Department Director Wang Xiangrong, Jinan Mayor Chen Weixin, Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee member Zhang Weicun, Jiaoji Railway Committee Chairman Sa Fujun, Salt Transport Envoy Wang Zhanghu, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xin Zhujiu, 94th Army Commander Cao Fulin, Pistol Brigade Commander Lei Taiping, 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin, Cavalry Division Commander Wang Guide, 1st Army Corps Chief of Staff Li Zongbi, and representatives from various sectors, news reporters, and others, totaling about one hundred people, had arrived. After 5:00 AM, a telegram was received from Dezhou stating that the guard train departed from Dezhou at 2:50 AM, Zhang's special train departed from Dezhou at 3:40 AM, and the staff train departed from Dezhou at 4:10 AM. When Zhang's special train passed through Dezhou, it stopped for an hour to refuel and water, but did not meet with the welcoming personnel. Subsequently, a telephone call was received from Yucheng stating that Zhang's special train passed through Yucheng at 5:30 AM and was expected to arrive in Jinan around 7:00 AM. At 6:15 AM, the first guard train arrived in Jinan, consisting of locomotive No. 166, two Jinpu third-class carriages, one Beining second-class carriage, six third-class carriages, two iron boxcars, one flatcar, one factory car, one Jing Sui third-class carriage, and one guard car, totaling fifteen cars carrying a squad of guards, four cars, and one car. The commander was Liu Duoquan, commander of the guard of the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office. At 6:55 AM, Zhang's special train arrived in Jinan, and the military band played loudly. The soldiers on the platform saluted. The atmosphere inside the station was solemn. Zhang's special train locomotive was Beining Road No. 163, consisting of three third-class carriages, two second-class carriages, one first- and second-class mixed carriage, one special private car No. 51, four private cars, one dining car, three first-class carriages, one lounge car, one official car, one flatbed car, and one guard car, totaling twenty cars. Zhang was riding in private car No. 51. The special trains of He Yaozu, Zhang Qun, and others also came from Tianjin, attached to Zhang's train. Li Shuchun, Wang Fangting, and other representatives sent by Han Fuqu to Tianjin to welcome him also returned to Jinan on the same train. Accompanying Zhang were Central Committee members Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Ji, Central Representatives Liu Guang and Wang Shuhan, He Fenglin, Director of the General Affairs Department Zhu Guangmu, Chief Secretary Ye Biliang, Chief of Staff Bao Wenjie, Adjutant Chief Huang Xiansheng, and Chief of the Military Supply Department Su Quanbin. Mr. Zhang was wearing a yellow wool military uniform, had a short beard, and looked energetic, but his face was slightly yellow and slightly dusty. After the train stopped, the welcoming personnel presented their cards and paid their respects. Zhang immediately invited Han Fuqu, Ding Weifen, and Li Jinglin to board the train for a discussion, and the adjutant extended the invitation to all the welcoming representatives to the first-class private car No. 101. Zhang talked with Han, Ding, and others for about fifty minutes before entering the first-class private car, where he was introduced to the welcoming personnel by Han Fuqu. Zhang stood up and spoke briefly, saying that the weather was too cold and he was ashamed that everyone had come here. He said that the armed comrades of the Third Route Army, under the guidance of Xiang Fang, had fought hard for more than half a year and finally ended the military campaign, pacified the local area, and suppressed the bandits. He said that this kind of perseverance was admirable. He said that he had only had correspondence with everyone in the past, but he was very happy to meet them today. He was sorry that he could not get off the train to have a pleasant conversation with everyone because the journey was urgent and he had to rush to Nanjing to attend the birthday celebration of the Prime Minister. He said that if he had some free time after returning from Beijing, he would be happy to get off the train and stay in Jinan.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Zhang Weicun, a member of the Provincial Reorganization Committee, delivered a welcome speech, saying that Deputy Commander Zhang had been stationed in the Northeast for several years, consolidating border defense, dealing with Japan and Russia, and preserving China's territorial sovereignty, which was already a great effort. In addition, in the recent punitive expeditionary war, the Deputy Commander supported the Central Government and eliminated the rebels, which enabled the military campaign to be resolved at an early date, which was a merit to the Party and the country. The people of this province were particularly impressed and grateful. Zhang replied, saying that Xueliang was young and his knowledge was shallow. He had been greatly favored by the Party and the country, and he felt that the responsibility he had fulfilled was not enough to repay the favor of the Party and the country. He could only try his best to fulfill his responsibility as a citizen. He hoped that everyone would not hesitate to give guidance so as to avoid making mistakes. Zhang Weicun also said that he wanted to invite the Deputy Commander to the Party headquarters to guide everything, but he was afraid that there would not be enough time. Zhang said that Xueliang was a layman in Party affairs and was only a mediocre Party member, so he did not dare to accept the invitation. At this point, Zhang accompanied Han Fuqu back to the private car, and the representatives left the car one after another. At 7:25 AM, Han Fuqu and Li Jinglin got off the train, and Zhang's special train left Jinan for the south. Central Committee member Ding Weifen and Liang Lieya, director of the Shandong Telecommunications Administration Bureau, also took Zhang's train to Beijing. The guard train departed for the south earlier at 7:00 AM. At 7:30 AM, the third staff train arrived in Jinan, consisting of two Beining third-class carriages, one first-class carriage, one Jinpu first-class carriage, one communications train of the communications battalion, one iron boxcar, one flatbed car, one baggage car, and one dining car. At 8:00 AM, the welcoming personnel left the station and dispersed. (November 11)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Qingdao Negotiations to Recover Japanese Fisheries Association <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Party and Government Are Studying Methods</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Japanese Fisheries Association was established during the Japanese occupation era. At that time, the association's rules were formulated by the Japanese military headquarters, which provided subsidies totaling more than 20,000 yuan. Japanese individuals, including Nakazato Masuki, etc., gathered funds to undertake the business, with a total capital of about 40,000 yuan. They also established a fish market and financial association at the Xiaogang Wharf. According to recent investigations, the association owns more than 50 fishing boats, including steamers and sailboats, large and small. The annual sales of fish are about 300,000 yuan. All Chinese and foreign fishermen who land fish must pay a commission of 10%. The association also designated 20 Chinese people to serve as brokers. All sales, purchases, and loans of gold pounds by Chinese fishermen are controlled by these brokers, and non-members of the association are not allowed to engage in fishing. This seriously infringes upon China's sovereignty. Therefore, after the recovery of Qingdao, Chinese merchants and civilians established the Fisheries Association and the Fisheries Federation to try to resist it, but the business failed due to poor management. The government also successively formulated regulations on banning fisheries, paying license fees, and collecting fishing taxes, but due to successive changes in leadership, they were unable to implement them thoroughly. After the establishment of the municipal government, it repeatedly sent personnel to conduct informal negotiations with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side used its vested rights as an excuse and said that according to the provisions of Article 2 of the Annex to the Shandong Case Agreement, the issue of vested rights should be clarified by China and Japan through appropriate means. According to Article 3 of the Fisheries Regulations published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, those who obtain fishing rights in territorial waters and public waters should apply to the government for registration in accordance with the law, but the applicant should be a Chinese citizen. The international practice is that only nationals can engage in fishing and coastal trade in territorial waters, which is consistent with the purpose of the article. Today, the Japanese Fisheries Association arbitrarily catches fish in the Qingdao coastal area, which not only infringes upon China's sovereignty but also violates international practice. It should be negotiated to cancel it in order to safeguard maritime rights. It is heard that the Municipal Guidance Committee has sent a letter to the municipal government requesting it to negotiate with the Japanese consul to recover the association. After the municipal government approved the letter, it is studying appropriate methods and will submit negotiations in the coming days. (November 11)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Public and Luo Divisions Recapture Xinyu and Fenyi <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Xinyu's Losses Are Around 4 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the general attack on the 5th by the 123rd columns of the 9th Route Army, the first team, Zhang Huizan's division, has moved upstream along the Gan River from Zhangshu and has already recaptured Qingjiang and Xingan. Yesterday, more than 200 bandit guns were seized in Xingan. The second team, Tan Daoyuan's unit, stopped at Qingjiang Gaoan. The third team, Gong Bingfan's division, concentrated on Gaoan and advanced towards Xinyu. Luo Lin's division concentrated on Shanggao and advanced towards Fenyi. Gong's Wang Maode brigade arrived at Hexia, Xinyu, on the 9th, repelled the bandit He Changgeng's force, and recaptured Xinyu County. The 77th Division, Luo Lin's unit, also arrived at Fenyi on the 9th. Commander-in-Chief Lu received good news from Gong and Luo divisions yesterday. Commander Zhang also sent a telegram from Zhangshu to the province reporting the bandit pursuit situation, which is recorded as follows: (1) Gong Bingfan's telegram: "My division's advance unit, Wang Maode brigade, arrived at Hexia at 9:00 AM today and engaged in a fierce battle with the bandit He Changgeng's force of more than 2,000 people for two hours. The bandit stubbornly resisted relying on the mountains. Later, my Liu Zhenhan regiment joined the left wing and encircled the bandit from Qianqiu Ridge, and the bandit began to retreat to Xinyu County. Wang Brigade immediately tracked and pursued and attacked the city directly at 1:00 PM, and after three hours of fierce fighting, the Liu regiment took over the North Second Pass. The bandit crowds scattered in the direction of Luofang Yueqiao. My division recovered Xinyu County at 4:30 PM. In this battle, the pseudo-captain Kong Yibao was killed, more than 120 bandits were killed, more than 20 were captured alive, and 45 long guns, more than 300 knives and spears, and many flags and propaganda materials were seized, and gentry were convened to properly plan for the aftermath." (2) Luo Lin's telegram: "My division arrived near Fenyi on a good day and engaged in a long and fierce battle with the bandits, killing countless bandits. In addition to sending teams to pursue, I also ordered my troops to continue to advance. There are now no bandit traces in Fenyi County, and the county will be recovered soon." (3) Zhang Huizan's phone call: "Since Zhu Brigade of my division conquered Xingan, it has been tracking and pursuing the bandits. On the border between Xingan and Xiajiang on Sunday, the bandits were defeated again, and more than 200 long and short guns were seized."</p>
<p>As for the disaster situation in Xinyu, according to reports from those who fled from Xinyu to the province, as follows (omitted above). On October 1st of this year, the large bandit forces of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang captured the county seat and occupied it for many days. The looting, arson, and killing were more severe than in neighboring counties. On the first day of this month, a large number of bandits from Xiajiang and Xingan folded to Yaoxu in the county (plotting to attack Shanggao Gaoan), and the situation was very fierce. The burning and killing were extremely tragic. According to refugees who detoured to Shanggao and Gaoan to the province, when the bandits concentrated in Xinyu, they divided into three detachments to attack: one detoured from Xiadong Yaoxu in the county to Huangtuzhan and Gaoan's Huibu in Qingjiang, and the Mengshan area in the county; one crossed the river from Shuikou in Henan in the county and detoured to Jieqiao Sanglin in Fenyi; and one attacked the county seat directly from Luofang in the county, and distributed them to Shuibei Jiangdong Guanchao Ouli and other places. Now, bandits are everywhere, looting and killing, and no one is spared. Moreover, they even allowed peasant bandits to seek revenge and retaliation in the villages every day, and colluded with local hooligans to set up township and district Soviet governments and peasant associations everywhere. They implemented a three-for-one and five-for-two system for able-bodied men to serve as Red Guards and vanguards. What is even more tragic is that the villagers of Hebei 48 in the county have always been known to be strong and fierce. They hated the bandits' rampage and repeatedly gathered to defend themselves, killing many bandits. The bandits hated them to the bone and retaliated extremely viciously. They would catch people and rob things when they saw them, and burn houses that were slightly new. From the first day of last month to November 5th, it is estimated that more than 2,000 houses were burned down, more than 5,000 men, women, old and young were looted, and more than 1,000 people were killed on the spot. The total local loss is about 4 million yuan, and the vitality is exhausted. It is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. To this day, the large bandits have not completely retreated, and the small bandits are even more rampant. Xinyu has been devastated, and it is not known to what extent it will stop.

<h3 id="e78">Private Planting of Tobacco Seedlings in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province; Provincial Government Has Strictly Ordered Prohibition <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Committee recently received reports that more than 20 villages, including Luoshang Village, Bianquetang, and Puzhao Society in Qingyang District, Jinjiang, and more than 10 villages, including Lingshui, in Anhai District, have already planted tobacco seedlings. The tobacco seedlings are everywhere on both sides of Quanan Road, which has not been seen in the past three years. It has been found that the chief culprit of tobacco planting in this session is the 13 villages in Maping District. The reason why the district dared to plant first was because it saw that the previous strict prohibition orders and the pressure of the army had resulted in the harvest of more than 200,000 yuan of tobacco juice, and the huge profits were unprecedented in the warlord era. This year, due to the resumption of competition for leased land, they sowed seeds one after another. They specially requested the Provincial Government to order the Ministry of Civil Affairs to first dismiss Chen Renjie, the county magistrate of Jinjiang, and select personnel to take office immediately, and to go to the same garrison to eradicate them, and to order the Provincial Defense Army Teaching Corps to send teams to assist in handling the matter. The Provincial Government has approved the order and ordered the Ministry of Civil Affairs to comply with it. (November 8)</p>
<h3 id="e79">News of Eastern Hunan Communist Bandits Fleeing South <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yizhang Legal Groups Request Guangdong to Send Troops to Suppress</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Zhu Mao Communist bandits have been fleeing on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi, sometimes gathering in southern Hunan and western Jiangxi, and sometimes spreading to western Jiangxi and eastern Hunan. Previously, due to the tense situation in the north, the authorities had no time to take care of them, so the bandit forces were able to grow and hide in western Jiangxi. Recently, the central government, seeing that the war in the north has ended, has sent large forces to Hunan and Jiangxi to suppress them. The bandits, hearing this news, have resumed their nomadic looting life. This area received a telegram from He Jian yesterday reporting on the bandit situation and requesting interception as appropriate. According to He's telegram, the various Communist forces of Zhu, Mao, Peng, Hu, and Kong, totaling about 10,000 people, suddenly crossed from western Jiangxi to eastern Hunan at the end of last month, mixed with scattered soldiers from various parties. On the 3rd of this month, the Hunan army Wang Shi Hou Brigade was ordered to go to Pingjiang to intercept them. After a day of fighting, the bandits suffered many casualties. On the 4th, they killed hundreds of bandits in Zhusha Ao Genglou. On the 4th and 5th, a large number of Communist bandits passed through Changshou Street, about 10,000 people, and continued to advance towards Pingjiang. Now the Hunan army Wang Division is deploying defenses in Pingjiang, and Tao Division is preparing to strike a heavy blow in Liuyang. It is deeply feared that once the bandits scatter and flee south, Guangdong authorities have recently taken strict precautions and ordered local officials in the northern Guangdong area to pay attention to the bandit traces at any time and report them immediately to eliminate hidden dangers. Recently, this area suddenly received a telegram from legal groups in Yizhang County, southern Hunan, stating that a group of Communist bandits had the appearance of fleeing to Chaling You County, and requesting Guangdong authorities to consider sending strong troops to station on the border of Beijiang. Yizhang in southern Hunan and the various counties of Pingshi Lechang Rucheng and Renhua in Guangdong are deeply connected. If there is an emergency in southern Hunan, then the Guangdong border will also be restless. Therefore, Hunan and Guangdong pay special attention to each other's border defenses.

<p>More Than a Dozen Suspects Arrested in Panyu's Pingshan Village</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Unlawful elements in Guangdong Province often establish private mints to produce counterfeit currency for illicit profit. Although private currency forging is strictly prohibited by national law, unscrupulous individuals, enticed by the potential for immense gain, disregard the risks. Following the dismantling of a paper currency counterfeiting operation led by Cui某 last year, authorities subsequently uncovered several private mints producing copper coins in areas like Shang Panyu and Henan. Recently, another massive private mint was discovered and dismantled in Pingshan Village, Panyu County. Earlier this month, a scholar, Mr. 某, secretly reported to the Finance Department that a local tyrant in Pingshan Village, Panyu, was secretly forging counterfeit currency on a large scale, guarded by armed personnel, making it difficult to apprehend without deploying armed forces for encirclement. Upon receiving the report, the Finance Department immediately dispatched Special Agent Chief Gao Dingrong leading a team of sixty special agents, along with Commissioners Xiao Songyou, Xiao Hanbin, and Chen Gongjie, accompanied by Inspector He Mingong from the Public Security Bureau, carrying a warrant from the Finance Department Director. The warrant stated: "Based on intelligence, Jian Bang, a local tyrant in Pingshan Village, Panyu County, is operating a factory there, illicitly forging counterfeit currency, which is highly illegal. You are hereby ordered to dispatch a team to investigate thoroughly, apprehend the suspects, and notify the local police to avoid misunderstandings. This is of utmost importance." Upon receiving the order, the officers convened at the Traffic Hotel, Room 50, on Changdi at 2 PM on the 7th to devise a plan for the raid. Given the strong security surrounding the private mint and the confusing network of small roads, the sixty special agents were barely enough to cover the area, requiring careful pre-planning and the recruitment of machine workers to dismantle the equipment. After finalizing the arrangements, they boarded small motorboats late on the night of the 7th and set off for their destination. By 4 AM on the 8th, with only a faint moonlight illuminating the sky, the soldiers landed and were immediately met with resistance. The guards on the watchtower, spotting a large group of strong men in the dead of night, sensed something amiss and opened fire to resist arrest. The special agent soldiers then divided into teams and surrounded the bandit's compound in Pingshan Village from all sides. Jian Bang, a local ruffian in the village, brazenly directed his men to resist the government forces. Initially unaware of the bandits' numbers, the government forces were unable to approach due to the bandits' heavy gunfire and were forced to return fire in an attempt to gain the upper hand. After holding their ground until dawn, it was discovered that the bandits numbered only about forty. The government forces then launched a full-scale assault, infiltrating the compound through side routes. The bandits, losing their fortifications, abandoned their weapons and fled. Government forces captured more than ten people on the spot, wounding two. The main culprit, Jian Bang, disguised himself among the bandits and escaped, evading capture. However, his wife, Jian Han氏, was apprehended in Jian's mansion. Six mint locations were discovered nearby, yielding approximately twenty loads of private minted silver coin machinery and thousands of counterfeit coin blanks, along with large baskets of copper sheets. More than forty laborers were hired to transport the goods back to the provincial capital. Additionally, more than ten bandits were escorted to the Finance Department. The suspects included Jian Han氏, 30 years old, from Panyu; Zeng Funian, 45 years old; Yuan Chi, 35 years old; Ye Rong Sheng, 21 years old; Liang Yao, 27 years old; Liang Run, 41 years old; Chen Ying, 32 years old; Lin Jin Gu, 20 years old; Lin Xitian, 28 years old, all from Panyu; Liang Sen, 20 years old, from Shunde; and Chen Tian, from Kaiping. Fan Yi, 31 years old, from Panyu, sustained a gunshot wound; Zhou Xian suffered a facial gunshot wound and fell heavily from the roof, sustaining severe injuries that may be life-threatening. Additionally, two gentry members suspected of harboring the criminals, Huang Bachen and Jian Jianmin, were also apprehended. The group was escorted to the Finance Department at 4 PM on the 8th for interrogation by the trial division. (Evening of November 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">National Government and Northeast China Dispatch Special Commissioners to Sino-Russian Conference <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Following the opening of the Sino-Russian conference, the proceedings stalled due to Russia's insistence on the Khabarovsk Protocol. Initial reports indicated that the National Government would dispatch four special commissioners to Russia to assist Mo Dehui, but there has been no further news. Upon investigation, it was learned that the so-called four special commissioners were in fact two commissioners each dispatched by the National Government and the Northeast. The National Government has appointed Qian Tai from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Zhu, while the Northeast has appointed Wang Mingchen, the current secretary of the Frontier Affairs Office, and Zhang Shou Zeng, the director of the Heihe Municipal Preparatory Office. Zhang was summoned by telegraph and departed from Heihe on the 20th of last month, arriving in Harbin on the 29th after nine days of travel. He arrived in Shenyang on the 1st of this month and is staying at the Kaining Hotel on Sanjing Road. On the 8th, a reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang, who stated that he was one of the four special commissioners dispatched to Russia. His departure date is contingent upon the arrival of Qian and Zhu from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shenyang, with whom Wang Mingchen, dispatched from this region, will travel. The date for departure to Russia is therefore uncertain. Although news of the conference has been scarce, it is unlikely to collapse. Mo's earlier proposal to return to China has been completely abandoned, and the prospects for the conference remain optimistic. We are being dispatched to Russia to assist Representative Mo in various negotiations. Furthermore, Mo's view is that as the plenipotentiary representative appointed by the National Government, he must follow the orders of the National Government. The National Government and the Northeast have consistently adopted a unified approach to the conference issue. As for the policies to be adopted by our side after the resumption of the conference, they can be determined after Deputy Commander Zhang meets with Chairman Jiang. Our actions can also be determined by this. Shipping between Heihe and Russia has resumed, with the shipping agreement signed by local authorities and the Russian side. The market is also peaceful.

<h3 id="e82">Plague Eradicated Along the Siping-Taonan Railway <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The customs along the Siping-Taonan Railway are crude and sanitation is generally neglected. Every year around July and August, outbreaks of plague are recorded. Although the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Office cooperates with local officials to prevent the spread and the Siping-Taonan Railway Bureau provides assistance, the plague is rampant, resulting in countless deaths and requiring significant time to eradicate. In August of this year, an epidemic broke out in Tongjiawopu, Gaiduan, Halagan, and Eight Faces Mountain Zhaodong villages and townships in Kaitong County, resulting in the deaths of thirteen men and women within days. Symptoms included headaches, coldness of the heart, mental confusion, and swollen buboes on the thighs. Doctors of both Western and Chinese medicine diagnosed the illness as the same as the epidemic of the previous autumn and confirmed the presence of bubonic plague after examining the blood of the infected. Epidemics also broke out in Hao Tu Tai and other villages in the third and fifth districts of the county, resulting in dozens of deaths. Furthermore, eight deaths from bubonic plague were recorded in Shuiquan Village in the Tuenquan region northwest of Taonan County. The Liaoning Provincial Government repeatedly ordered the Shenyang Municipal Hospital and the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Office to dispatch capable personnel for prevention and treatment and to properly plan prevention measures. Corpses and rooms were disinfected and burned, and car tickets for Kaitong Station and other places were suspended for several days. Carbolic acid and other items were purchased for door-to-door disinfection and strict quarantine. Cases of the plague were immediately reported to the city by the district sub-offices, and doctors were dispatched for diagnosis and treatment. Temporary epidemic prevention and inspection stations and epidemic isolation centers were also established in Qian Fanzhi's district, and the treatment of the epidemic was gradually undertaken by medical officers, and the epidemic gradually subsided. Statistics showed approximately one hundred deaths before and after. Currently, no deaths have been reported for the past half-month, transportation has been restored, and the epidemic has been completely eradicated. (November 9th)</p>

It is said that the bandits took Hua's concubine and daughter to Panluotang Bridge that night (about three or four li from Qingyang Town, Cheng County), which is an extremely remote area with several dilapidated houses. The bandits ordered the two to stay in the house. Hua's concubine and daughter were extremely anxious and cried uncontrollably. An old woman from a small village next to the dilapidated house heard the crying and went to inquire. The two women told her the whole story. The old woman said, "I have decided to send you two back first, don't be sad. But after you return home, quickly prepare 7,000 yuan to redeem the land deeds (totaling 320 mu). Don't delay, or else there will be consequences." After saying this, she ordered two bandits to take the Hua women to Huangdu Place by boat and put them ashore. The two then hired a fishing boat and returned home. Afterwards, it was speculated that the old woman might be the mother of the bandit leader. Currently, Hua Jinhan is still hesitant about redeeming the land deeds.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Central China University Students Urge Yu Youren to Return to School <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The League of Chinese Public School Students Yesterday Submitted a Request to the Board of Trustees, Firmly Supporting the Board's Resolutions</p>
<p>(National News Agency) The League of Students of the Wusong Central China University, who have resolved the student unrest, yesterday submitted a request to the school's board of trustees, expressing their firm support for the board's original resolutions and urging the new President, Yu Youren, to take office immediately. The original text reads: "Since the honorable board resolved on October 30th to approve Mr. Ma Junwu's resignation and elect Mr. Yu Youren to succeed him as President, all the students, except for a few troublemakers, have been overjoyed and celebrating. However, the next day (October 31st), a small number of troublemakers, Zhang Yaoxian, Pang Mengfei, and others, took advantage of Mr. Liu Binglin, a member of the board of trustees, coming to the school to teach economics, coercing Mr. Liu to report the truth of the board's resolution in the auditorium. They immediately seized the opportunity to announce the convening of a general assembly. Under the direction of the chief of general affairs, Wang Hongshi, with only a little over two hundred people, they dared to falsely use the name of the entire student body to forcibly pass a resolution opposing the honorable board's resolution. They also illegally produced a delegation of eleven people: Zhang Yaoxian, Li Shengjian, Pang Mengfei, Wu Moyue, Yi Yue, Ou Yingzhao, Xie Jieping, Liu Gongren, Liao Junqing, Chen Baoqiu, and Liao Lie. They established an office in the eighth classroom and organized a discipline squad to patrol day and night with wooden sticks, resulting in the genuine opinions of the majority of students being unable to be expressed. On the [blank] day of this month, the delegation again used the [blank] time to falsely report news, forcibly holding a so-called second general assembly. The number of people was only over two hundred. The delegation's [blank] discipline squad used [blank] force to guard the gate, not allowing anyone to leave their seats, and resolved to retroactively approve the transfer of student union funds, etc. On the morning of the 10th of this month, the delegation again used the [blank] time to forcibly hold a so-called third general assembly. The number of attendees was still less than three hundred, and they still forcibly held the meeting place, more clearly announcing their opposition to the honorable board's resolution, vowing to defend Mr. Ma first, and strongly resisting Mr. Yu's presidency. Furthermore, the chief of general affairs, Wang Hongshi, handed the keys to the delegation, completely sealing off the classrooms and auditorium, forcing the entire student body to strike. Such illegal behavior is truly unforgivable. After being forced to strike, the majority of students were extremely indignant and spontaneously launched a resumption of classes movement. Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, trustees Hu Shi and Wang Yunwu came to the school to report. About five or six hundred students gathered in the auditorium to listen to the news (the auditorium can at most accommodate a little over five hundred people), which was still less than half of the entire student body. After Trustee Wang read Mr. Ma's letter, Trustee Hu immediately explained it, saying that Mr. Ma's words in the letter, 'I very much want to meet with you all,' meant that he was extremely willing to return to be President. This was already ridiculous sophistry. He also said, 'Based on my (Mr. Hu referring to himself) thirteen years of experience seeing student movements, strikes never fail. Because after a strike, the students disperse, general assemblies cannot be held, and strength cannot be expressed. Therefore, you should support Mr. Ma's reinstatement by resuming classes. I will definitely help you realize this. If the board of trustees does not allow Mr. Ma to return to school, then it will not be too late to strike, even for a year, two years, or three years,' and so on. Secretly, Mr. Hu is excessively clever. How could he possibly come up with this behavior of inciting [opposition to] the honorable board's resolution? It is truly perplexing. Finally, he claimed to have the qualifications of a former President, current trustee, and dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, and acted on behalf of the student union chairman, disregarding the students' legal questions and resolutely putting the issue of resuming classes as conditional upon Mr. Ma's reinstatement to a vote. This overstepping of boundaries is inappropriate for Mr. Hu. In short, Mr. Hu's visit to the school contains the following four suspicions: (1) Inciting students to oppose the honorable board's resolution; (2) Representing the board of trustees with the qualification of a trustee; (3) Suggesting methods for students to stir up trouble; (4) Acting on behalf of the illegal student union chairman with the qualification of a trustee, etc., monopolizing the meeting place. Mr. Hu's advice to students to resume classes is truly the wish of the entire student body, and should not be made with ulterior motives. The students vow to uphold the honorable board's original resolution and welcome Mr. Yu's presidency. We hereby respectfully submit this document to the honorable board, requesting that it firmly maintain the original resolution and urge Mr. Yu to come to school as soon as possible to formally take office. We cannot express the urgency of our request enough. Respectfully submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Chinese Public School, Cai [blank]."</p>

<h3 id="e100">President Li Lianggong of the Agricultural College of Labor University Sends a Letter to All Faculty and Staff <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>President Li Lianggong of the Agricultural College of Labor University respectfully addresses all faculty and staff: "Yesterday, I saw a letter from nine teachers, including Wu Shuge, Fang Cheng, and Chen Guorong, to all students of the Agricultural College. In a fit of anger, they slandered me in many ways. Currently, there are three major disputes in our school: one is the entire student body's opposition to the school affairs meeting and the expulsion of the presiding officers, Mr. Peng Xiang and Mr. Cheng Yuyun; the second is the chemistry department students' opposition to Mr. Fang Cheng and Mr. Wu Shuge; and the third is the horticulture department students' opposition to Mr. Chen Guorong. The school affairs meeting, at a critical moment, could not take the overall situation into consideration, indulging in emotional actions and rejecting Mr. Zhuang Quan as the Dean of the Engineering College, which triggered a major change and lost the students' trust. I advocate acting cautiously with the school and the studies of over a thousand young students as the premise. Instead, they accuse me of colluding with the Ministry of Education, defaming me in various ways, even abandoning lectures during class time to engage solely in personal attacks, which aroused the students' antipathy. The facts of who instigated the student unrest are clear. Mr. Fang Cheng and Mr. Wu Shuge have even come up with a novel idea, openly telling the chemistry department students that I have signed a secret treaty of twelve articles with the Ministry of Education, but have not dared to respond to the students' requests to announce the content and evidence of the so-called secret treaty, thereby exposing their lies, losing the trust of the entire department's students, and reaching the point where they cannot attend classes. In order to maintain the memorial, I still put aside personal grudges and try my best to guide the students. As for Mr. Chen Guorong being opposed by the horticulture department students, it has not been a matter of a single day, with a complex background that is painful to speak of. Mr. Chen himself is very clear about this, so Mr. Chen once proposed three conditions to me: one was to dismiss Mr. Zhang Nong, the director of the agricultural field; two was to separate the horticulture experiment from the agricultural experiment; and three was to have the horticulture department students submit letters of repentance. I replied that the first two items could be my responsibility, but there was no way to do the third item because the students had not publicly opposed him. I only made a request to the administrative side to replace the department head. Of course, the administrative side could refuse to accept it and reprimand him with righteousness, ordering him to remain as if nothing had happened, without delving deeper. Mr. Chen was not satisfied. Subsequently, Mr. Su, Zhang, Zhou, Ma and other teachers took a week off. I even ordered student representatives to request classes at Mr. Chen's and other teachers' residences. Mr. Chen remained consistently dissatisfied. Now he has joined forces with Zhang Xiannong, Sheng and others, and Wu is making things difficult for me. Isn't this ridiculous? The above is the cause and process of the disturbances. Who is attacking colleagues and who is instigating student unrest need not be inferred. As for the accusation that I am scheming for power and trying to become the President, it is extremely laughable. When Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Wu Zhihui, and former President Yi were in Beijing discussing with the Ministry of Education about changing the receiver to a point inspection and appointing Mr. Liu as the President, and I was temporarily acting on his behalf before Mr. Liu arrived, Mr. Peng Xiang was in Beijing and was the first to hear about it. Mr. Peng's return to school on the day I received the telegram from Mr. Li and Yi inviting me to Beijing was formally reported at the school affairs meeting. This was clearly predetermined by Mr. Li and Yi. I still felt ashamed of my lack of talent and dared not accept it, and have formally declined to Mr. Li and Yi. How could there be any scheming? And when Mr. Zhang Nong first arrived at the Agricultural College at the beginning of the summer vacation, he said to people, 'President Li's position cannot be maintained for long, and the authorities and students are looking to me.' When the news of Mr. Li and Yi's proposal to have me act as the President spread, I had not yet returned to Shanghai. Mr. Fang and Wu immediately yielded the position of Dean of the Faculty of Science. Subsequently, Mr. Fang and Zhang successively made excuses to say that they were summoned to Beijing by telegram from Mr. Yi and hid for several days. It was not until Mr. Yi returned to Shanghai that we learned that there was no telegram summoning the two gentlemen. Then, what is the meaning of scheming for power? Previously, a leaflet signed 'School Protection Group' was found on the Jiangwan campus. No one in the school had ever heard of this kind of 'School Protection Group.' The purpose of this anonymous leaflet was unfathomable at the time. Now Mr. Fang, Wu and others cite this as one of my crimes, which shows the depth of their scheming. Recently, someone even went to the Public Security Bureau to accuse me of selling soil. Police officers came to the door to search, but found nothing and left. At that time, I happened to be away from home, only frightening my old mother. I went to the bureau to inquire who had accused me. The bureau chief refused to reveal the true name, but said that he lived at a certain number in a certain neighborhood, which was already clear. Now they are citing this as one of my crimes, which further shows the insidiousness of their intentions. They are doing everything possible to fabricate and falsely accuse me, so it is no wonder that they make up groundless and baseless stories. Recently, there have been several anonymous threatening letters saying that if I do not resign from the position of President, they will use a handgun against me. These letters have all been sent to the Public Security Bureau for safekeeping. Since they have reached the point of doing anything, a violent attack is also possible. I have decided to leave Shanghai and go elsewhere. I respectfully request that all the teachers in the school jointly maintain the school affairs. The various disputes cannot be resolved until the new President arrives. I will also wait until then to submit my resignation. It is not that I dare to lightly abandon my responsibility when the turmoil has not settled, but because the cause of education is not the responsibility of one person. Since there are people among my colleagues who disregard the overall situation and only indulge in emotional actions, before the new President arrives, my staying here will not be enough to resolve the disputes. I hope that the teachers will lead the students to attend classes peacefully and wait quietly for the new President to arrive and resolve the matter. I hope you will understand my personal difficulties. I respectfully wish you all well. Your humble servant, Li Lianggong, respectfully presents this on November 13th."</p>

<p>The Celebration of the Premier's Birthday Committee Yesterday Sent Out Five Essential Telegrams</p>
<p>The representatives of various sectors of Shanghai held the 65th anniversary celebration of the Premier's birthday on the 12th of this month, and passed five major proposals, which were telegraphed by the Municipal Party Headquarters' Propaganda Department. It is understood that these telegrams were drafted by the Municipal Propaganda Department yesterday and sent separately. The original texts are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram Congratulating the Opening of the Fourth Plenary Session: To the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Nanjing Central Committee: At this time when the great chaos has just subsided and unity has begun, your committee is convened in a timely manner to consolidate the foundation of unity and realize lasting peace. The people yearn for this, and all sides rejoice together. Recalling that since the beginning of political tutelage, due to repeated disruptions by warlords, the Central Government has been exhausted from suppressing rebellions and has not been able to focus on construction. Now that the obstacles have been removed and peace has reappeared, the members of your committee will surely be able to use their farsightedness and insight to formulate comprehensive plans for the major policies of the party and the country, to relieve the suffering of the people and complete the construction of political tutelage, to establish the foundation for national unity and peace, and to lead the nation to prosperity. We hereby send this telegram to congratulate you and express our sincerity. The Shanghai Celebration of the Premier's Birthday Conference respectfully submits.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Elimination of Remnant Warlords: The Central Government's repeated campaigns to suppress rebellions are for the purpose of seeking genuine unity for the country and pursuing lasting peace. Without unity, political tutelage and construction cannot be carried out smoothly; without peace, the suffering of the people cannot be relieved. In recent years, if it were not for the successive rebellions of the warlords such as Yan and Feng, the construction of political tutelage would have been considerable long ago. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang bravely suppressed the rebellion, and Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang assisted the Central Government. The rebellions were quelled and peace was restored. As all sides celebrate the Premier's birthday, your committee is convened in the capital, and Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang has also come south to participate in your committee, gathering comrades together to decide on the major policies of the party and the country. Hearing this good news, all are rejoicing. However, the remnant warlords in the country have not yet been eliminated, which hinders the future of political tutelage. We dare to ask your committee to order Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang to use their wise and brave means to jointly eliminate the remnant warlords, and then lay the foundation for the country, bring politics back on track, and reform society, so that the whole country can enjoy the benefits of the Three Principles of the People as soon as possible. Saving the country from danger and supporting the weak, we will feel the grace of the coming rescue; restoring the country and invigorating it, we vow to exhaust our sincerity in supporting it. The Shanghai Celebration of the Premier's Birthday Conference respectfully submits.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Elimination of Bandits and Communists in Various Places: With the defeat of Yan and Feng, the military affairs have ended, and your committee is convened in a timely manner, all are rejoicing. We believe that the implementation of all new policies depends on the stability of social order; otherwise, we will be too busy saving lives to discuss implementation. In recent years, the bandits and communists have been rampant, and there is no place that has not suffered from their harm. Society has collapsed and the people's livelihood is truly shocking. We dare to ask your committee to order the troops stationed in various places to eliminate the bandits and communists within a time limit, in order to eliminate the factors that disrupt order and destroy tranquility, and to establish a stable and strong foundation for the country and society. Then, let the people live in peace and work happily, smoothly implement new policies, vigorously promote the revitalization of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and jointly alleviate economic difficulties. Receiving these benefits, we dare not expect them without addressing them to your committee. We are overwhelmed with anticipation as we await your reply. The Shanghai Celebration of the Premier's Birthday Conference respectfully submits.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Revision of the Sino-Dutch Treaty: To the National Government: The abolition of unequal treaties is the legacy of our Premier and has been the focus of our Central Government's efforts in foreign affairs over the years. We have learned that the Sino-Dutch consular treaty expired in August. We hope that your government will re-revise it, based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit between the two countries, and remove the shackles of the past. The Shanghai Celebration of the Premier's Birthday Conference respectfully submits.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting Protest Against the Dutch Mistreatment of Overseas Chinese: To the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: In recent years, the repeated oppression of our overseas Chinese by Dutch imperialism has been reported frequently. Recently, there have been reports of the insult of Ms. Xiao Xin'an and the expulsion of Comrade Feng Hanyue. We are all outraged. Various places have been forced by righteousness to unanimously condemn them. However, the Dutch authorities have despised our country and have not yet made any expressions. This is not only the insult of Xiao and Feng individually, but the disgrace of our entire nation. We dare to ask your ministry to promptly conduct serious negotiations with the Dutch government, seeking to punish the culprits in order to restrain the ambitions of imperialists. We are overwhelmed with anticipation as we await your reply. The Shanghai Celebration of the Premier's Birthday Conference respectfully submits.</p>

<p>Eliminate Evil and Punish Villainy, Transform the People with Virtue</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, on the occasion of the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, yesterday sent a telegram to express its congratulations. The telegram reads: To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, forwarded to the Fourth Plenary Session: With the defeat of Yan and Feng, the rebellious atmosphere has subsided and the situation of unity has been established. Your committee, with the urgent national affairs and numerous matters awaiting management, is convening a meeting at this time to decide on measures and steps. The assembly of talented people will surely be able to formulate comprehensive plans, meeting the expectations of the people throughout the country. The affiliated committee respectfully represents the people of Shanghai in congratulating your committee. However, amidst the encouragement and joy, there are still things that we cannot refrain from saying. We believe that since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been frequent disturbances and the people have been living in misery. The cause of this is not without problems. During this busy period of political tutelage, the implementation of all measures should adopt economical methods and scientific means, addressing the urgent and the slow in order to refresh politics, clarify laws and regulations, implement construction, and stabilize society, eliminate evil and punish villainy, and transform the people with virtue. By doing so, the people of the world will develop faith and love for our party and work together to realize the Three Principles of the People, so that the foundation of unity can be consolidated and the blessings of peace can be enjoyed forever. This will not only benefit one country. We are overwhelmed with joy and eagerly await your reply. The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee respectfully submits.</p>

<p>Arrival Scheduled Around the 20th, Ford Airplane Sent to Beijing to Await Him</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and Commander of the Northeast Border Defense, is traveling south this time to pay respects to Chairman Jiang in Nanjing and meet with various committee members of the National Government to discuss the aftermath of the Hebei situation. Once negotiations are complete, he is expected to visit Shanghai. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency met with a person close to Zhang, who stated that Zhang is indeed planning to come to Shanghai, likely around the 20th. He will likely choose one of the private residences of Li Shizeng and Zheng Yuxiu as Zhang's office. Rumors of purchasing a new residence in Shanghai are untrue.</p>
<p>Another dispatch reports that the Ford airplane has performed exceptionally well in test flights in Beijing and Shanghai. The other day, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jiazhen heard of Commander Zhang's trip south and originally intended to take the Ford airplane back to Beijing. However, due to the illness of pilot Hudson, he was unable to do so. Wang instead took a night train to Beijing. Yesterday, Deputy Director Liu Yunfang of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiated with the Ford company. Hudson had recovered and flew the Ford airplane to Beijing at 1:20 PM yesterday to prepare for Deputy Commander Zhang's arrival in Shanghai and for Chairman Jiang, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, and Vice Minister Wang Jiazhen to test it. Deputy Director Liu telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e119">More Chinese Laborers Deported from Japan <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>This year, due to the contraction of various factories and plants in Japan, over one thousand Chinese laborers have been laid off, unable to survive, and deported back to China. This time, seventeen Chinese laborers from Yamashita-cho and Oshima-cho in Tokyo, Japan, including Li Yanjin, Lin Qinguang, Zhuo Yunzhai, Wang Zhongdai, Xu Bingyan, Cai Sanmei, Chen Jinshi, Chen Shanfa, Wu Baofu, and Pan Ziyuan, were sent to Shanghai by the Japanese due to lack of livelihood and have already arrived in Shanghai, landing at the Wayside Wharf. The cruelty of the treatment they received from the Japanese and their miserable state upon arrival in Shanghai are difficult to describe. There are also five people, including Jiang Boqing, Xia Zhenru, and Zhang Yinkuang, who were deported to Shanghai from Nagoya. Also, a Chinese laborer who was laid off from Shimonoseki was also deported back to China.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Proposal to Change Insurance Policies to Chinese <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Companies Must Register Before Operating</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that insurance policies should all be in Chinese. It was reported to the relevant authorities for review and implementation. The case involves a suggestion from Supervisor Lu Qisheng of the Chamber of Commerce. In recent years, cases of insurance companies refusing to pay claims have been frequently reported, especially the case of Barreto and other insurance companies refusing to pay over 300,000 taels in Xinji insurance money to the Fuzhou community. In some cases, they used the excuse that the conditions were in foreign languages. Contracts should be made with full understanding of both parties before they are signed. However, most people in society rely on the incomplete information from insurance brokers and do not read the foreign language documents. They rashly pay the premiums and receive a piece of foreign language paper as evidence. When an incident occurs, the insurers then quote the clauses and regulations, stating how the incident is not covered or not their responsibility. This is something that the general public hates and despises. To correct the past and plan for the future, the clauses and regulations on life and fire insurance policies must be abolished and only Chinese should be used as the standard. All life and fire insurance companies, whether Chinese or foreign, must register with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government before they can operate, otherwise they should be banned. This will not only prevent civil disputes, but also recover economic losses. Therefore, it is proposed to forward this to the National Government for thorough implementation. It was discussed at the sixth executive committee meeting on the 8th of this month that the insurance business is related to the life and property of the people and is not a trivial matter. Insurance policies are a kind of contract given by the insurance company to the insured. If both parties do not understand it, it is impossible to establish trust. There are many well-established insurance companies in Shanghai, but there are also many with weak capital who use it to defraud. The insured do not know the inside story and only rely on brokers to forward the information, giving them a piece of incomprehensible foreign language document. They have no way to understand what is written in the document. The resulting abuses, such as refusing to pay claims or deducting payments, are endless and the harm is not insignificant. It was unanimously agreed that the proposal to abolish foreign languages and use Chinese for life and fire insurance policies, and that all companies, whether Chinese or foreign, should register with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce before they are allowed to operate, is indeed to correct past mistakes and safeguard national sovereignty in the future. It was unanimously decided to approve the proposal and forward it to the National Government for review and implementation. This is for the public good. Sincerely submitted to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>The French Side Indicates a Price and Agrees to Transfer</p>
<p>The Jinliyuan Wharf case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been suspended for a long time due to the transfer of Father Xiaqi of the Sanduo Church to Korea. It is now learned that lawyer Bahe, the representative of the Sanduo Church, has submitted the wharf price to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the two sides are conducting negotiations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Indicated Price: Lawyer Bahe sent a letter to Lawyer Gao Shuo yesterday, indicating that the Sanduo Church officially agreed to sell, but the asking price for the sale was 390,000 taels per 1.16 acres. A reply was required by the 14th of the month, otherwise a request would be made to the Municipal Council for execution.</p>
<p>Extension of Negotiations: General Manager Li of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company convened a meeting with Lawyer Gao Shuo to discuss the response. The response was that the deadline was too tight and serious consideration was needed. As a result, Lawyer Gao visited Consul General Gan orally at 11:00 AM yesterday to request the Municipal Council and grant a one-month extension to allow for a longer period of consideration. Lawyer Gao also told him that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had been transferred to state ownership and asked for consideration of Sino-French friendship and a further extension. The result was agreement.</p>
<p>Attitude of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Lawyer Gao Shuo wrote a letter to Bahe to respond to the Sanduo Church and entrusted a Chinese Christian to mediate with the priest to reduce the price and schedule negotiations. In the future, the price will be based on the assessment of the Shanghai Municipal Council so that neither party will suffer.</p>
<p>Reply to Lawyer Bahe: I received your letter of November 3 this year from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, delivered by your lawyer, stating that the Sanduo Church agrees to transfer all of Deed No. 69 of the Love Character to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and listing various conditions. My lawyer, in the capacity of arbitrator, represents the reply and agrees with the fundamental points of the letter. However, the conditions are of great importance and require serious consideration. We have requested the French Municipal Council to extend the deadline by one month for longer consideration. We should first reply to your lawyer for your information and to forward it to the Sanduo Church. Lawyer Gao Shuo, November 13, 19.</p>

<p>Reduce Wages and Maintain Operations, Willing or Not is Up to You</p>
<p>The thirty-two silk factories in this city that are planning to start operations sent a notice to the female workers yesterday, stating that the silk market is in decline, stocks are difficult to sell, and the cost of cocoons exceeds the selling price. The factory has been losing money for a year, so it has no choice but to temporarily suspend operations. Now, it has received a notice from the silk factory industry association, advising it to endure the pain and try to start operations for the sake of the livelihoods of the workers after a long period of closure. Therefore, it has to save costs in order to barely maintain operations. The wages of all silk reeling female workers will be temporarily calculated at 50 cents per day. All other parts will be reduced accordingly. It is up to each of the female workers to decide whether or not to come to the factory to work. The factory will not force them. This notice is hereby given for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Both Railways Will Convene a Business Conference <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>After Liu Weizhi, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, concurrently took charge of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, he said that the two railways run through Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. One end is Shanghai, the largest commercial port in the country and the only port for the import of foreign goods, and the other end is the capital, which is connected to the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways in the north, and adjacent to the richest provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi in the west. One end is Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, which will be the starting point of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and an important route for goods from the interior of Anhui. According to the location and situation, the freight transportation of the two railways should have been developed long ago. However, in the past, the executives of the two railways did not have an in-depth study of the routes of water and land transportation and the types and quantities of products along the way, nor did they have sufficient contact with local commercial banks, factories, and transit industries, so that both the railways and businesses did not benefit. Director Liu saw this, so he ordered Liu Chengchang and Zheng Baozhao, the directors of the Vehicle Department, to discuss the reorganization of the Vehicle Department and the addition of a commercial section to plan to improve the freight transportation of the two railways. Since the reorganization, it has only been five months, and the freight transportation of the two railways has gradually increased. Director Liu and others believe that this development is the initial effect of the reorganization. If the organization is further improved, the future will be limitless. Therefore, it has been decided to convene a business conference of the two railways next month to discuss all specific methods. At present, preparations are being actively made. Here is an exploration of the preparations.</p>
<p>Busy Preparations: Director Liu believes that this conference will directly benefit the business development of both the railway bureau and the merchants, and indirectly reduce the people's livelihood. The importance of its mission is no less than that of the financial and industrial and commercial conferences convened by various ministries. Therefore, there must be sufficient preparations before this conference. It is said that Director Liu has authorized the Vehicle Department to preside over the entire conference, so Liu Chengchang and Zheng Baozhao, the directors of the Vehicle Department, are currently very busy preparing for this matter.</p>
<p>Inviting Members: It is said that in addition to the directors and section chiefs of the railway bureau as natural members, the conference will invite representatives from the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, chambers of commerce from cities and counties along the way, chambers of commerce from various industries, transit companies, and transportation experts. All invitation letters will be sent out soon.</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions: In addition to asking each member to submit proposals in advance or temporarily, the Railway Bureau welcomes any improvement plans for railway transportation from all walks of life. However, they must be sent to the Railway Bureau in advance for discussion at the meeting.</p>

<p>Resolution of Seafarers' Wage Increase: After the Union repeatedly sent representatives to discuss the contract with the Taikoo Company, both parties agreed to make concessions to resolve the issue of seafarers demanding wage increases from foreign ships, which has been reported in this newspaper.

It was stipulated that from September 1, all seamen, firemen, and stewards would receive a wage increase of four yuan per month. The Union side agreed that if the company needed assistance within the scope of the Union, it could consider the situation and provide assistance with its consent.

<h3 id="e145">### Large Batch of Heroin Continued to Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>A total of 111 boxes in three shipments, worth approximately over one million yuan. The smugglers appear to be from a certain country. The third batch will continue to be inspected today.</p>
<p>Regarding the seizure of a large quantity of heroin worth over 200,000 yuan by the Jianghai Customs in goods transported to Shanghai on the Italian ship Koldirana, a detailed report of the matter obtained by a reporter is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e146">### First Seizure in Hong Kong <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The seizure of heroin by the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai was the second such incident. The first seizure occurred in Hong Kong. Previously, the Italian Postal Shipping Company's Hai Guan Da ship, which sailed from Austria to Shanghai, arrived in Hong Kong. In late last month, the ship was loaded with 49 boxes of goods shipped from Trieste, Austria, to Shanghai. 28 boxes were marked to be unloaded in Shanghai, and the rest were to be unloaded in Dalian Bay, divided into three bills of lading. The bills of lading stated that the goods were raisins and other food. Hong Kong customs officers opened the boxes and discovered that they were all morphine, heroin, and other drugs. The value was enormous, at least 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. The goods were immediately seized because the bill of lading did not specify the consignee, so it was impossible to know the purchaser and transporter. The ship then arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, but unexpectedly, three boxes were left on the ship that were not searched by the Hong Kong customs. After arriving in Shanghai, they were picked up by private buyers, but they had already suffered losses.</p>
<p>The second batch, discovered in Shanghai, was mostly shipped from Austria. The shipping point has not yet received news of the failure in Hong Kong. The second batch of goods shipped to Shanghai was only half a month apart from the first batch. The second batch consisted of 26 boxes (mistakenly reported as 36 boxes yesterday), which were still transshipped from Constantinople to China. They were divided into two batches, one with 20 boxes and the other with 6 boxes, which were handed over to the Italian Postal Ship Coldelana for transport to Shanghai. The ship entered port on the 7th. When it passed through Hong Kong on the 4th of this month, Hong Kong customs wanted to seize it, but due to time constraints, the customs officers were unable to board the ship before it set sail. They immediately sent a secret telegram to Shanghai, ordering the Jianghai Customs to be vigilant. When the Jianghai Customs sent officers to search the ship, the goods had already been picked up and placed in the Gonghexiang Wharf warehouse. Six boxes in the two batches had already been picked up by the consignee, so only 20 boxes were searched. The bills of lading and box surfaces still stated "raisins," but upon inspection, they were found to be a large amount of heroin. These 20 boxes alone weighed 2,200 kilos. Because the bill of lading did not have a consignee, the customs office seized the goods and stored them in the customs warehouse while investigating the smugglers.</p>
<p>The third batch arrived yesterday. The second batch had just been seized by the customs when the Italian company's ship Cracovia arrived yesterday with few goods because it was mainly carrying passengers, so there were only a few hundred items of imported goods. Unexpectedly, goods were found among them with the same packaging as the previous two batches, also transshipped from Constantinople and without the consignee's name. There were four batches, totaling 33 boxes, with a total of 3,559 kilos. The Italian Postal Company first discovered the goods upon arrival in Shanghai and ordered the ship to temporarily store the goods in the Gonghexiang warehouse and to check the bills of lading and other numbers. It was expected that the Jianghai Customs would definitely find out or would seize them. When the reporter inquired yesterday, he learned that the goods had not yet been opened for inspection by the customs office. However, since they were shipped by the original company and packaged in the same way, it could be predicted that they must be toxic substances.</p>
<p>Smugglers of Toxic Substances The total number of toxic substances smuggled to Shanghai this time, including those confiscated in Hong Kong, totaled 111 boxes in three batches. Nine boxes were picked up, and the total weight of the three batches was 20,665 kilos. The shipping agent in Austria was Transportlnternatilnaux, and according to the reporter's investigation, the consignee in Shanghai appeared to be from a certain country. The nine boxes that were picked up in the first two shipments were all in the name of Meishlco, which appears to be the name of a trading company from a certain country, but the address is unknown. As for the 33 boxes that arrived yesterday, some were labeled "raisins" and others "clansing material." 19 of the 33 boxes were marked for transshipment to Tianjin and Dalian. The total value of the three batches of heroin was at least 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. This is truly the largest amount of drugs flowing into Shanghai in recent times.</p>

<p>Cause Was a Misunderstanding with the 27th Regiment of Soldiers</p>
<p>From around 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. yesterday, all public buses on Zhabei's 123 Road were suspended. According to the company, at around 10 a.m. yesterday, Public Bus No. 4111 on Zhabei 1st Road was traveling from the North Station to Tongji Road on Tiantong'an Road when two soldiers from the 17th Company of the 27th Regiment wanted to board. The driver refused because it was not at a designated stop. The soldiers boarded anyway and fell off the footboard as the bus was moving, tearing their clothes. The bus continued to Jiangwan to turn around and, unexpectedly, the two soldiers had gathered a crowd and blocked the bus, throwing stones and breaking the bus windows. The driver and ticket seller were injured, and one of the passengers was also injured in the head. The others escaped. The two injured were sent to Jisheng Hospital. The doctor said that their lives could be saved if there were no complications within 24 hours. The staff on the 123 Road bus went on strike in the afternoon, citing unprovoked harassment. The Garrison Headquarters dispatched an adjutant to mediate with the Public Security Bureau. No results were achieved. At around 4 p.m., the buses resumed normal operation. The damaged bus was also driven back to the company at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e150">### A Small Kidnapping Case in Caojiadu <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Four-Year-Old Boy Jin Lin Went Missing and Was Redeemed for 140 Yuan. The Culprit Cao Zhigan Has Been Arrested. The Rickshaw Driver's Identification Was Unmistakable.</p>
<p>Jin Lin, the four-year-old son of a woman named Huang Li from Jiangbei, who resides at No. 3273 Zhoujiazhui Road, suddenly disappeared while playing at the back door around 5 p.m. on October 6. Huang searched everywhere without success. Huang has only this one son and was extremely anxious. She posted a note at the entrance of the alley, stating that if someone returned the child, she would give 50 yuan and would not go back on her word. However, it was still ineffective. Huang could only weep and sob every day until an old woman came with a letter on the 9th of this month, saying that she had news of her child, who was near the Caojiadu Garden. It would cost 140 yuan to get him back. Huang was overjoyed upon hearing this. After lunch, she took the money and went to negotiate with the old woman and her brother-in-law, Huang Lao Si, according to the instructions. They waited for a long time, but no one came to negotiate. The old woman then excused herself and left by tram. Later that night, as it suddenly started to rain, a rickshaw slowly approached. Her son, Jin Lin, was sitting alone in the rickshaw. At that time, someone behind her shouted that she should put the money on the ground and take her son home from the rickshaw. Huang did as she was told, left the money, rushed forward, grabbed her son, hired a rickshaw, and returned home with her brother-in-law, Huang A'si. The pearl was returned to Hebu. According to reports, the Harbin police arrested a criminal in the case. The Western detective and Chinese detective Zhou Kaiwen arrested a criminal named Cao Zhigan from Jiangbei near the Ren Shou Li area of Caojiadu on the evening of the previous day and brought him to the police station. The police chief ordered him to be detained and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the case and requested a postponement. The plaintiff, Huang Li, testified about the previous events. According to Wei Haosan, the rickshaw driver, on that evening, there were three men and two women at the entrance of Ren Shou Li in Caojiadu. The defendant was one of them and hired him to drive the rickshaw. The child was held by an old woman and boarded the rickshaw. The defendant and another man hired two other rickshaws to follow behind. They got off at the back door of Zhaofeng Garden. After a while, the plaintiff arrived and took the child away. The whereabouts of the other defendants and the old woman were unknown. Huang Lao Si testified that he and the plaintiff went together and waited until late at night when they heard someone say to put the money on the ground and the child was in the rickshaw and to quickly go and get him. However, he could not see the person's face clearly. The defendant completely denied the charges, saying that he had been working as a ticket collector at the Yangzhou Theater in the Fifth District of the Chinese area for many years and had no time to commit such a crime. Ge, the prosecutor, ordered the witness, the rickshaw driver Wei Hongsan, to come forward again to carefully examine the defendant's face, fearing that he had made a mistake, otherwise he would be punished for perjury. He also ordered the court attendant to turn on the lights. Wei carefully examined the defendant and replied that he was not mistaken. Prosecutor Ge ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Wang Fucai Fined 300 Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Fucai, a Ningbo native who was the chief stoker on the Xiefopai Mei ship, was arrested on the 30th of last month for inviting Li Zaichen (also a Ningbo native), the head of the Western waiters on the same ship, to Room 13 of the Mibo Hotel in the French Concession and using threats to demand 4,000 yuan that he should have received for bringing eight Cantonese guests with smuggled yellow croaker fish to the United States.

<h3 id="e153">### A Record of the Autumn Chrysanthemum Exhibition of the Gardening Society <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Extraordinarily Successful</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Western Gardening Society (SHANGHAI HORTICULTURAL SOCILTY), founded in 1875 by the British in the Municipal Council, initially limited its membership to Westerners. Later, people from various countries joined. In recent years, Chinese gentlemen from Shanghai, such as Hui Yuting and Ding Runxiang, joined as directors, and the scope of the society gradually expanded. It now has hundreds of members. The society holds competitions every spring and autumn and appoints judges. This year, Sir Peter Grain and Ding Hui served as judges and awarded prizes. The competition has been held at the Municipal Hall for many years. Last year, it was changed to the Dahua Hotel, which has a larger venue and more varieties of flowers. Ding also proposed that non-members be allowed to join the competition, which improved the results. Yesterday was the date of the society's Chrysanthemum Competition. The reporter took time to visit and saw various rare flowers and plants arranged in the room. Entering the room was like being in a fairyland. There were too many varieties to count. Some had flowers of several colors, and some had flowers as large as bowls. The flower stems were all four to five feet tall. The flower growers also competed to create various patterns with the flowers, which was a magnificent sight. Ding built two large flower towers, one with the letters S.H.S (the abbreviation of the society's Western name) and the other with two stars. It is said that Ding won two of the three first-place medals for the large flower towers. The other was won by the mistress of the Xinkang Garden. She also won the first prize for the six potted flower towers. The winners of the first prize for the scattered pots were the Westerner Mai Lai, the Deputy Chief of the Municipal Council Martin, and the Chinese Feng Bingnan and Li Bake. Ding also won the first, second, and third prizes for the scattered pots. In addition to chrysanthemums, there were also various agricultural products on display, classified into different categories. Ding's red peppers were five to six inches long and three to four inches in diameter. Lighting them up was truly like holding a candle at night, which was a rare sight. It is said that the seeds of the agricultural products came from abroad, but the products were larger and better than those from abroad. This was probably due to the fertile soil and proper cultivation. In short, the prosperity of the society today is due to the efforts of Ding, the directors, and the Chinese and Western members.</p>
<h3 id="e154">### The Finale of the Municipal Garden Chrysanthemum Exhibition <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The lively scene of the Municipal Garden Chrysanthemum Exhibition has been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. The last day of the exhibition happened to be the Prime Minister's birthday, a holiday for all sectors, so the number of visitors increased sharply. Huang Daolin, the section chief of the municipal government, came again to enjoy the exhibition for the second time. Shen Yi, the director of the Bureau of Public Works, and the teachers and students of Tongde and Tongji Medical Colleges also arrived successively. More than 30 male and female teachers and staff of Shanggong Elementary School also had a meal in the venue. Zhejiang University's Agricultural College, seeing that the venue had many famous chrysanthemums, specially sent Mr. Ji Zhuomin to request that some good varieties be shared. Shi Bumei, a painter from eastern Zhejiang, also brought writing utensils to sketch the chrysanthemums in preparation for making a catalog. Other celebrities brought cameras to photograph the chrysanthemums all day long. Until the setting sun, the ferries were about to stop, and there were still people reluctant to leave, which can be said to be a testament to the love of chrysanthemums. After the review committee completed the judging of the exhibits, it was heard that Xiaoguan Garden and Bixia Garden were the most outstanding, and the Public School Garden, Shen Xingyuan, Sanyou Industrial Society, Jinan University, and the Rural Normal School also scored well.</p>
<h3 id="e155">### The Pingyang Warship Damaged in Bandit Suppression <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday for Repairs</p>
<p>At around 8 a.m. yesterday morning, three large black pirate ships carrying 200 pirates were discovered outside the Wusong Estuary, attempting to loot five merchant ships anchored in the harbor. Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th Team of the 4th District of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Water Police, was leading the Pingyang gunboat on patrol in the waters off the Yemao Estuary. Seeing the situation, he immediately opened fire with fast cannons and machine guns at the pirate ships. The pirate ships also opened fire and resisted stubbornly. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the pirate force was overwhelmed and hoisted sails to flee to the open sea. The Pingyang warship was hit by the pirate ships' gunfire, damaging the hull, steering room, stern, and wings, making it unable to pursue. The pirate ships escaped. The warship arrived in Shanghai yesterday for repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e156">### Appeal from the People of Zhu Zhai Due to Crop Failure <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Zhai Town in the western suburbs of Shanghai, at the intersection of the three counties of Shang, Jia, and Qing, is an area where the people depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Cotton and soybeans are the main crops. This summer, due to uneven rainfall and a typhoon, the harvest was greatly reduced, and the farmers were worried. They have repeatedly appealed to the local authorities to request that Shanghai and Jiaqing counties send people to inspect the damage in order to reduce taxes. Shanghai Jiading sent people to inspect the damage a few days ago, but Qingpu County has not yet expressed any opinion. It was heard yesterday that local authorities have again submitted a request to the Qingpu County Government's Finance Bureau to send specialists to the countryside as soon as possible to inspect the disaster situation in order to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Continued Burial of Exposed Corpses at Pushan Villa <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Junsheng, Director of Pushan Villa, following the wishes of Mr. Wang Yiting, Chairman of the Joint Charity Organizations, has been handling the burial of exposed corpses in the areas bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang for three years, burying a total of 29,713 bodies. However, he laments that there are still more than 100,000 corpses in various places that have not been collected and buried. This winter, the work will continue. Recently, he personally went to various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to discuss the matter. As the weather gradually turns cold and the west wind rises sharply, even the small bones among the corpses seem to feel the cold and burrow into the mud, which is truly pitiful. It can be seen that although humans are the most intelligent of all creatures, even their dead bones still know the warmth and cold of the seasons. Mr. Wang was heartbroken by the sight and rushed back to Shanghai to raise funds. He immediately notified Wangjiangjing, Wangdian, Jiaxing, Nanxun, Yanmu, Zhenze, Puyuan, Pinghu, and other places to start collecting and burying the corpses, so that those exposed can be laid to rest and the foul odor will not be carried by the wind, which is of great importance to public health in the area. It is hoped that the wealthy people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, who are not lacking in benevolence, will hear of this and generously contribute to this good cause, which will truly bring immeasurable blessings.</p>

<p>As the winter season arrives, petty thieves are rampant. In order to reduce kidnapping and theft cases, the Concession authorities have ordered all police stations to instruct Chinese and Western detectives to search pedestrians along the way. The effect has been remarkable. At about 10:30 last night, detectives from the Laozha Police Station were searching pedestrians in the Zhengjia Wood Bridge area. A man named Zhao Siqing, 38 years old, from Jiangbei, who runs Hengji Rickshaw Company on Jiaxing Road, happened to have red pills hidden in his pocket. When he saw the detectives approaching, he ran away. The detectives suspected that he was hiding weapons and mistook him for a bandit, so they opened fire several times. Zhao was shot in the right shoulder, the bullet pierced his back, and he collapsed, bleeding profusely. He was then escorted to Renji Hospital for treatment by Western police officer No. 28 from the Laozha Police Station.</p>

<p>Miss Sheng, a young woman from Ningbo, aged 23, residing at No. 56 Xiafei Lane, Xiafei Road, in the French Concession, is beautiful and fashionably dressed. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, her family borrowed an ambulance from the Public Concession Municipal Council and took her to Baolong Hospital for treatment, falsely claiming that she had suddenly suffered a stroke. After examination, the Western doctor determined that she had undoubtedly consumed raw opium. She was given injections and stomach pumping, and her condition improved slightly, but due to excessive poisoning, she was still not out of danger late into the night. The reason for her suicide is still under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Conflict Between Workers and Russian Man, Police Station Accuses Chauffeur <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Prosecuted for Aiding Others to Hinder Freedom</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, a construction site near Bailinan Road and Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai saw a conflict between water and carpentry workers and a Russian foreman, Mr. Gordistin, over the calculation of wages. The workers hired a car to take Mr. Gordistin to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, accompanied by the accountant and others from the construction site. After questioning by District Chief Ren, it was decided to refer the case to the Judicial Section of the General Bureau for review. This matter was reported yesterday. Bailinan Road was originally built by the Municipal Council beyond its boundaries, and the house being built is also located in the Chinese area. Therefore, after the conflict, the workers took Mr. Gordistin to the police station. The car was rented from the Wanguo Automobile Company on Yuyuan Road, license number 12519. The Jing'an Temple Police Station received a report and immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the construction site, and arrested the chauffeur Cao Deyuan. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer filed a lawsuit against Cao, accusing him of helping others hinder Mr. Gordistin's freedom. The police escorted Cao to the Special District Court, and three witnesses, an Englishman Mr. Tenley, Mr. Talin, and an American Mr. Afang, testified in court. The defendant also hired lawyers Fan Gang and others to defend him. Judge Sun Yuan briefly questioned them and ordered Cao Deyuan to pay 2,000 yuan in bail and wait for the Public Security Bureau to bring the witnesses to court for further questioning. Besides the Russian Mr. Gordistin, Zhang Guirong, the accountant, Hua Guanhong, and Wang Asi, workers, are being detained at the Public Security Bureau. The names recorded in yesterday's report differ slightly.</p>

<p>Two Seriously Injured, Three Slightly Injured</p>
<p>At about 9:00 PM on the 8th of this month, several workers were on their way home after work, passing in front of Qiming Girls' School on Tianyao Bridge. Some French sailors from the Catholic Church, drunk and in a group, used wine bottles in their hands to hit the workers. The workers were unable to avoid them and were hit on the head, bleeding profusely. They then pulled out knives and stabbed at them randomly, causing them to faint instantly. Two people were seriously injured (Ding Jiaqun and Luo Haiyou), and three were slightly injured. Liu Yunfang, the chief of the Second Precinct of the Sixth District, upon hearing the news, personally led the police to the scene. The French sailors immediately closed the iron gates of Qiming Girls' School and fired shots repeatedly. (According to reports, the French sailors were stationed inside the Qiming Girls' School established by the Catholic Church.) Chief Liu was not afraid and captured the French sailor who committed the crime, along with a cartridge case, and brought them back to the station. He sent the injured workers to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to his superiors for serious negotiations.</p>

<p>Concubine Formally Married, Leading to a Chaotic Brawl</p>
<p>Wei Chunsheng from Pudong, over forty years old, is engaged in the barge business and owns two docks and boats. He is now a deputy foreman of a barge company and is relatively wealthy. He is fond of carousing. His wife has already given birth to a son and daughter. Three years ago, Wei took a concubine. Recently, he became romantically involved with Yang Lanhua, a prostitute from a brothel in the French Concession. Lanhua is only in her early twenties, beautiful and charming. The two are deeply in love and have pledged to be together forever. Lanhua is unwilling to be a concubine, so Wei, infatuated with her beauty, agrees to formally marry her, agreeing to pay her family 700 yuan. The wedding was scheduled for the 20th, a few days ago. They rented a hall at a hotel on Avenue Edward VII, set up a wedding hall, prepared a wedding feast, and invited relatives and friends to a banquet. In the evening, they used a colorful sedan chair and ceremonial guards to bring Lanhua to the hotel. As the two were bowing to heaven and earth, red candles were burning high, and the hall was filled with joy, Wei's wife Zhu, along with her children and relatives, barged into the hotel and started a brawl. They knocked the flowers and candles on the platform to the ground. Zhu grabbed Lanhua and beat her severely. The colorful clothes, jeweled crown, glasses, and red veil worn by the bride were all torn off. Seeing that the situation was not good, Wei took the opportunity to escape through the back door of the hotel. With the persuasion of relatives and friends, Zhu and others were stopped, and Lanhua was released. The wedding hall was a chaotic mess. The relatives and friends were about to start feasting when they were suddenly dispersed, which was a great disappointment. Wei compensated for all the damaged clothes the next day, and the matter was settled.</p>

<p>Wang Fengsheng, a resident of No. 23 Dachang Lane, Yangshou Alley, South Wharf, South Shanghai, works as an import goods tax inspector at the Railway Tax Bureau of the South Railway Station. At about 5:00 AM yesterday, six robbers suddenly came to his house. They were wearing short blue and black clothes and spoke with Shandong, Jiangbei, and Ningbo accents. One of the robbers held a letter and entered the house under the pretext of asking for someone. The other robbers followed and broke into the living room. Two robbers guarded the front and back doors, while four robbers went upstairs. Wang had not yet gotten out of bed but woke up upon hearing the noise. The robbers pointed a gun at him and said that they knew he was a well-known and came to borrow 2,000 yuan and told him to hand it over quickly. Unable to resist, Wang had to let them search and rob him. The robbers stole more than 400 yuan in cash, a pearl necklace, a pearl ring, a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a gem-inlaid ring, and a gold button, worth a total of about 400 yuan. After getting the loot, the robbers shouted and fled north. Wang then reported the robbery to the First Precinct of the First Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and asked them to investigate.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Municipal Government Revises Regulations on Road Construction Fees <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government revised the Shanghai Road Construction Fee Regulations yesterday. The following is a special excerpt:</p>
<p>Revised Shanghai Road Construction Fee Regulations, Chapter 1: General Provisions, Article 1: For the purpose of opening or renovating roads and carrying out other ancillary projects in this city, road construction fees may be levied from landowners on both sides of the road in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations. Article 2: All land within the boundaries of this city, whether publicly or privately owned, shall be subject to the provisions of these Regulations. Article 3: The road construction fees levied under these Regulations shall be divided into two categories: project fees and land fees. (A) Project fees include construction of roads, ditches, bridges, culverts, etc., and costs of house demolition, etc. (B) Land fees include compensation for land acquired. Chapter 2: General Rules, Article 4: For roads that are opened or renovated at one time, project fees and land fees may be levied simultaneously. The amount and payment deadline shall be announced by the Municipal Government each time a road is built. Article 5: For roads that are not renovated at one time, project fees shall not be levied, and the land fees that landowners should pay according to Article 12 of these Regulations may be paid when a complete section between two roads is renovated. Article 6: The area used as the basis for levying fees shall be limited to those benefiting from the road construction. The standard shall be twice the prescribed width of the road, extending from the new road into both sides. In special circumstances, the Municipal Government may increase or decrease it at its discretion. Article 7: When neighboring roads are opened at the same time, resulting in overlapping fee ranges, the boundary of each road's fee zone shall be determined according to the following provisions: (A) The length of the land and frontage at the corner shall be bounded by the bisecting line of the intersection point of the two roads. (B) When the distance between the front and rear roads is too narrow, causing the overlapping of benefit ranges, the boundary shall be the dividing line of the overlapping part. (C) When roads are opened around the land at the same time, refer to the provisions in paragraphs A and B. Article 8: If land is within the benefit range prescribed in Article 6 of these Regulations, and there is no access road connecting to the new road, it shall not be considered as benefiting and no fees shall be levied. However, if the situation changes due to the transfer of property rights of the land before and after, the fees shall still be calculated and paid in accordance with the fee unit in Article 9 and the provisions in Article 12 of these Regulations, and the burden shall be borne by the heirs of the landowner. Chapter 3: Project Fees, Article 9: The calculation standard for levying project fees shall be based on dividing half of the total project fee levied according to the length of the frontage of the entire road, and the other half according to the amount of benefited area of the entire road, to obtain the fee unit, and then calculate the levy based on the frontage length and benefited area occupied by each household. Article 10: The levy of project fees shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions, but in special circumstances, the Municipal Government may increase or decrease them at its discretion: road width of 20 feet and below, levy 100% of the project fee; 25 feet, 80%; 30 feet, 60%; 35 feet and above, 40%. Article 11: If neighboring roads are opened in stages, the levy of project fees for roads opened later may be recalculated and offset according to the length of time between the openings in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of these Regulations to levy the difference, or levied separately as usual, all of which shall be handled at the discretion of the Municipal Government. Chapter 4: Land Fees, Article 12: All land required for road construction shall be levied at 30% of the current market price of the benefited land on both sides. Chapter 5: Fee Procedures, Article 13: When paying compensation to landowners, the fees payable by the person receiving the compensation may be deducted. If it is insufficient, the landowner shall pay the full amount. Article 14: Landowners shall pay the fees in full within the prescribed time limit. The payment deadline for vacant land shall not exceed one year at most. The fees for building land must be paid before construction begins. Article 15: If landowners are unable to pay the fees, they may request the competent authority of the Municipal Government to purchase all or part of their land at the land price before the road was opened or renovated for compensation. If there is any remaining money, it shall be returned to the landowner. Article 16: If landowners fail to pay the fees in full within the time limit, it shall be regarded as tax arrears, and interest shall be levied on the amount owed at an annual rate of 5% from the date it should have been paid. Article 17: When the land price tax owed by landowners reaches the total amount of tax payable for three years, the competent authority of the Municipal Government may notify in writing 30 days in advance to auction all or part of the tax-defaulted land and its fixtures to the extent sufficient to offset the tax owed. If there is any remaining money, it shall be returned to the original tax debtor. Article 18: Landowners who can provide sufficient tax payment guarantee after receiving the notice in the preceding paragraph may have the auction postponed by the competent authority of the Municipal Government to show consideration. However, this postponement shall be limited to one year at most. Article 19: The road construction fees levied after the land price is announced in this city for the purpose of implementing land value increment tax shall be deducted when levying the increment tax. Chapter 6: Supplementary Provisions, Article 20: These Regulations may be revised at any time if there are any matters not covered. Article 21: These Regulations shall come into force on the date of promulgation by the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3 id="e173">A Record of Exploring Doucui Rock <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zixian</p>
<p>I started from Qujiang, Guangdong, through mountain paths. All I passed were towering mountains and steep ridges. I often walked for dozens of miles without seeing any human habitation. After walking for five days, I finally arrived at Dutou Si, forty miles south of Zixing County, Hunan Province. My colleague, Mr. Cao Xiangjing (a native of Zixing), told me, "There is a scenic spot here called Doucui Rock, which is about five miles away. Why don't you go for a visit?" I said, "Good." Mr. Cao said, "I have a teacher named Li who is currently in charge of the local defense bureau. We can invite him to come along as a guide." So, Mr. Li led the way for a visit. What I saw in the rock was of great research value. At that time, I recorded one or two things. Now, it has been almost three years since I came to Shanghai, and I can no longer remember them. I happened to read my old diary, and the scenes and circumstances are still vivid in my mind. I have specially recorded them here for geologists to explore.</p>
<p>At half past four that afternoon, Mr. Li hired a small boat. After boarding the boat, the river was narrow and the water was rapid, flowing downstream. In less than half an hour, I saw a high mountain towering into the clouds. Mr. Li pointed and said to me, "This is Doucui Rock." I went ashore and climbed up the stone steps. It took about half an hour to reach the summit. Although we were all healthy, we all felt tired. After a short rest, we summoned our remaining courage and continued to advance, finally reaching our destination. In front of the rock was an ancient temple, which was very clean. There were about dozens of monks. When they saw us suddenly arriving in military uniform, they were shocked and didn't know what to do. It turned out that no soldiers had ever visited this mountain. We asked them, and most of them were beggars from Sichuan who had been here for many years. After a short rest, I wanted to go inside and explore as soon as possible for the sake of enjoyment. Because the cave was as dark as pitch, a servant burned pine resin oil (because there was very little oxygen in the cave, so it was not easy to suffocate) to lead the way. As soon as I entered the cave, I saw smoke filling the air. There were several monks surrounding the Bodhi tree, chanting Buddhist scriptures incessantly. They were performing evening prayers. The inside of the cave was about two feet high from top to bottom and about three or four feet wide from front to back, like a house. To the right of the cave, there was a small spring gurgling. It was clear and sweet to drink. According to the servant, the spring water does not decrease if you take it, nor does it increase if you don't take it. It is available at all times of the year, and the wonders of physics are truly immeasurable. Behind the cave wall, there was a hole that could only be passed by a servant who led us into another large cave. The upper and lower parts of the cave were about four or five feet high. On the right, there were icicles hanging down like eaves, countless. Looking around, they were all red in color. The sound of striking them was as loud as a chime, which was also something that people could not bear to let go of. After passing through another small hole, there was another cave. On one side of the cave stood a stone tablet with the "Exploration Record of Doucui Rock" carved on it. I hurriedly did not take a closer look. Behind the tablet, there was a small cave. The servant said that this was the Immortal Cave. A monk from Sichuan came here one day, entered it, and never came out. It is said that he has become an immortal. We all wanted to enter, but the cave was extremely low, only four or five feet, or two or three feet, and we had to bend down and crawl down. When we reached the end of the cave, there was something like an earthen door. Looking inside, it was a small rectangular cave about five feet long, with a width and height of two feet. When we lit a torch, we saw a corpse lying there. The skull and cheekbones were still vaguely discernible. We retreated quickly, and then carefully recognized what was written on the tablet, which roughly said that this cave was in the Republic of China, year thirteen, when a famous person named Doucui entered the cave to explore. The fire he was holding suddenly went out. Fortunately, he had matches and lit it again, and then he discovered this relic. Therefore, it is said that there is an immortal in this cave who transformed here. I didn't believe this at the time. Perhaps someone curious wanted to explore the cave to its end, but there was no air inside, causing the fire to go out, and they could not get out and suffocated to death there. We were inside for three hours, and we were all exhausted and dared not go any further. So, we returned along the original route. When we came out, Mr. Li also said that before that, he and four or five friends had once ventured deep into it. One time, they entered the cave with fire at about four o'clock in the afternoon, passed through one cave and came out of another, and were even more timid and exhausted, and there was still no end. By the time they came out of the cave, it was already eight o'clock the next morning. He spoke as if he were talking about a tiger with a broken string. That night, we all stayed in the temple and had a vegetarian meal. At dawn, we saw the steep cliffs behind the mountain standing tall and impassable. There were no other high mountains nearby. I recalled where the spring water inside the rock came from, and why there were so many caves. The changes in the earth's crust are so profound that they cannot be measured. It is a pity that this mountain is unfortunately located in such a remote area. If it were in prosperous places such as Guangzhou or Shanghai, and artificial repairs were carried out to open it up with tunnels, install electric lights, and make the air circulate and have light, then tourists would follow one after another. The name of Doucui Rock should also be spread far and wide.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Hao Shuchen's Peach Blossom Village <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Chongliang</p>
<p>Hao Shuchen's newly staged "Peach Blossom Village" is taken from the story of Lu Zhishen Drunkenly Beating the Little Overlord in "Water Margin". It was compiled by my friend Wu Huansun, the host of the Yinbi Hall. This humorous comedy has long been famous in Pingjin. Shuchen once used this play and "Flying Tiger Dream" (Niu Gao's Marriage Recruitment at Ouhangguan) as a means of attracting audiences when he was a pillar performer in Tianjin, opening a new era for pure clowns to support a troupe alone. Its box office success was not weak, which shows its excellence. This time, Shuchen came south, and because there were too many roles in the troupe, the plays were not easy to distribute. It was not until last week that it was posted for performance. The audience praised it highly. The night before, it was performed for the second time. The reporter made a special trip to visit. I first met Shuchen backstage. Everyone advised Hao Da not to stick to the example of Lu Zhishen's bare chest and abdomen because of the sudden cold weather these days. Hao said that if he removed this costume, he would lose the original character of the rough monk. Moreover, the most taboo thing about acting is laziness, so he was unwilling to be lazy. From this, it can be seen that Shuchen is serious about everything. This play focuses on acting, reciting, teasing, and singing. Most of the singing is fragmented and not complicated. Shuchen's reputation for reciting plays with good timbre, pure charm, sufficient transmission of spirit, and clear pronunciation has been established for a long time. Watching his appearance and self-introduction, as well as the large section of dialogue about pretending to be a Buddha to deceive food, can be described as perfectly integrated with divine inspiration, humorous and witty, and most able to arouse the audience's interest. The scene of dressing up as a woman in the bridal chamber does not fall into the stereotype of Li Kui in Qingfeng Village. From head to toe, he completely changes into women's clothing, waiting for the Little Overlord to answer questions in the bridal chamber one by one by throwing them out of the tent to strengthen his belief and add humor. The compiler's ability to innovate and bring forth new ideas is truly ingenious and insightful. When advising the Little Overlord, he uses his own experience to show the great purpose of transforming evil and improving goodness, which is very appropriate, and clearly outlines the entire play, attributing the report to correcting people's hearts. This play is indeed not a fictional story. Yang Sili was a popular actor more than ten years ago, but now he is down and out. His voice is still sweet and round. The tricks he plays have unexpected twists and turns. Because of his background as a martial clown, he plays the Little Overlord with a crisp recitation that is superior to others. The tumbling and jumping in the bridal chamber battle are very skilled. It is conceivable that Zhu Guangzu, who stole hooks in the Chain Trick, can still be picked up. Now that there is Shuchen's Dou Erdun and Ruian's Huang Tianba, why not rehearse it once? In the play, when the Little Overlord takes a sedan chair to welcome the bride, he uses Suona to compose new lyrics and sing the Great Repair Vat tune. Also, the Great King is forced by Lu Zhishen to imitate the undressing of a porter. The two scenes are interspersed and are quite lively. The compiler can be said to be good at using play materials.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Dwarf Island <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>A certain number of miles from the northern coast of Africa is what is known as the Tim Ers Island, commonly known as Dwarf Island. The natives there are short in stature, only two feet from head to toe, with yellow skin and black faces, no different from the Inuit people of North America. However, due to their remote location and inconvenient transportation overseas, few Europeans and Americans have been able to reach their land. This summer, the British explorer Mr. Darley ventured to go there to learn about the internal situation and quickly recorded it to provide assistance for conversation.</p>
<p>The dwarves live a simple life, eating dairy and meat, wearing fur, living under the sky and on the earth, with no fixed residence, just like a primitive tribe. However, they like to raise dogs. Wherever they go, they have hundreds of dogs, or at least dozens. When hunting, they guide the dogs forward, and then they carry bows and arrows to follow. The bow is no more than a foot long, and the arrow is only an inch long. The upper end is glued with poison. If they encounter a fierce beast, they draw the bow and shoot it. The arrow enters the beast's eye, and the poison takes effect and it falls to the ground. Then they order the dogs to drag it away. There are many wild birds and beasts on the island. In addition to hunting beasts, the dwarves are also good at catching birds. Their method is similar to the previous one. Swans and wild ducks are often used to feed the dogs. The dogs are fat and big, not inferior to European products. It is common to see them barking and biting wildly at strangers. Cowardly people have no choice but to retreat. When Mr. Da first arrived, he brought a lot of meat to feed the dogs. The dogs were too busy fighting for food, so he was able to go deep into the inland. When the dwarves saw him, they were greatly surprised, thinking that a god had descended from the sky. They bowed down and prostrated themselves, murmuring something unknown. Mr. Da then took out bread, melons and fruits to give to them and returned home overnight. It is said that he brought back a lot of rare birds and animals.</p>
<p>Short Message: The Shanghai Flower Planting Association held a chrysanthemum convention yesterday at the Dahua Hotel. Chinese and Western people with a love of flowers displayed their famous varieties of chrysanthemums in the meeting, supplemented by other exotic flowers, plants, fruits and vegetables, which were bizarre and dazzling. The beauty of the layout was especially unprecedented. Among the products of our country, Mr. Ding Runxiang, Gu Lanzhou, and Li Bake all won awards. Especially Mr. Ding's products were numerous. The chrysanthemums were so fat, beautiful and extraordinary that they could not be described. Some of them were decorated with flower buds to form Western characters, so they won the top two awards. Many visitors praised them incessantly.</p>
<h3 id="e176">A Brief Account of the Chinese Quarter in San Francisco (Part 2) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Kang</p>
<p>Guilds, public offices, schools, and clubs are mostly located on Stockton Street. The Chinese Guildhall, the Chinese Overseas School, the Tongyuan Association, the Kuomintang, the Constitutionalist Party, the Zhigongtang, the Youth Association, and the new and old churches all face each other. There are six Chinese newspapers in the Chinese Quarter: "Young China," which is the Kuomintang government's official newspaper; "National Public Daily," which is the Kuomintang's left-wing newspaper; "World Daily," which is the Constitutionalist Party's newspaper; "Gonglun Morning Post," which is the Zhigongtang's newspaper; "China and West Daily," which is the Christian church's newspaper; and "Jinshan Times," which is the American-born Chinese Association's newspaper. They are all not far apart, and each newspaper publishes two to three thousand copies.</p>
<p>The city government specially built a primary school for overseas Chinese near Stockton Street. The students are divided into classes totaling more than 1,500 people, which is the largest number of students in the city. The principal is an American teacher. Since last year, there have been two American-born Chinese women who have graduated from the California Normal School. Chinese children above middle school age can study with Americans, so there are no specially built schools. The original overseas Chinese were divided into six guildhalls according to their respective towns, but later they jointly organized the Chinese Guildhall. Each guildhall is attached to a primary school. The Chinese Guildhall has three levels of junior high school. All of them focus on Chinese studies and use textbooks published in the mainland. Boys and girls are in the same class. Classes are held every evening from 5:00 to 8:00. Each school has at least 100 people, and some have as many as 400 to 500 people. In the past 30 years, American immigration regulations have become increasingly harsh, and the number of overseas Chinese has sharply decreased. Fortunately, the number of American-born children has increased, and their educational progress has also been quite advanced. The future is immeasurable.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese are all Cantonese, and their lifestyles and customs are the same as those in the mainland. Men do not all wear Western clothes, but they all wear short coats. Women wear a mix of Chinese and Western clothing, taking a compromise. Entertainment includes food, drink, singing, dancing, and gambling. The streets are especially bustling and lively at night, with a constant stream of pedestrians and customers filling the seats at late-night snacks. The sound of wind and string instruments can also be heard from time to time, but according to custom, they do not dare to drink heavily and get drunk. Westerners come to the Chinese Quarter to visit in an endless stream. There are sightseeing buses and local guides and interpreters. On average, there are three to four hundred people every day. The Youth Association has specially set up a reception center. The Chinese Quarter of San Francisco is actually the only model residential area for Chinese people in the New World. Although there are many overseas Chinese in cities such as New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia, they are scattered in various places and are far from being comparable to this.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Tears Fall on All Sides in Sadness of Red Love, a Seat Leans Inward in Lingering Green Intent</p>
<p>It turned out that Ling Zhixiang had several wives at home. They didn't all live in one place. He would rather walk a little himself, coming here today and going there tomorrow. He had his palaces everywhere. He said that under the rule of a man, there simply cannot be two factions of women. Women are really like tigers. When two tigers fight, one will definitely be injured. If two women share one man, they will have to fight to the death. As the saying goes, one bowl doesn't ring, but two bowls clang. This is not wrong. Living in different places, although it is a bit of labor to run east and west, it is more peaceful in spirit. Otherwise, living in one place, quarreling morning and night, is a common thing among adult gentlemen and families, and is not surprising. But it still brings a kind of unhappiness to people's spirits. Therefore, he has all the wives living in one place, and those who live in one house have to be ranked as the first wife, the second wife, and the third wife. Those who live separately naturally have a good way to make them all equal. Do you know what it is? People are named after the place they live. For example, those who live on Mahou Road are called Mahou Road Wife, and those who live on Kader Road are called Kader Road Wife. Those who live on Malang Road and Baochang Road are called Malang Road and Baochang Road Wife, just like the Shandong governor and Henan governor in the warlord era, who are all called after the place names, or like the Hefei chancellor and Nanpi minister in the former Qing dynasty. Their place names were used as general names. Later, after people got used to calling them Mahou Road Wife and Kader Road Wife, they removed the word "Wife" and simply called them Mahou Road and Kader Road. They called each other Mahou Road said this and that, and Kader Road said this and that. Mahou Road can stand up and speak, which is like a joke. In fact, this is just a habit and is not surprising. Fortunately, they each guard their own territory and do not invade the boundary. If people don't offend me, I won't offend them. As long as Mahou Road doesn't go to Kader Road to quarrel, and Kader Road doesn't go to Mahou Road to scold, they can live in peace. As for their own demands, those who have a little nagging and chattering, as long as they are handled properly, there is always a way. Ordinary women can be dealt with by using a little emotionalism and massage-style diplomacy. The first thing is not to let the two sides meet. After meeting, things will gradually happen, and even conflict with each other. He is a polygamous family. The policy for dealing with polygamous families is this, so people often ask him what the secret is for a man with one wife and one concubine to be fine all day long from morning to night and from night to morning, making the man feel embarrassed. Sometimes both sides want to detain him, and sometimes both sides reject him. Seeing that Ling Zhixiang has five or six wives and is always okay, people often ask him what the secret is.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Financial Gold Standard Reversal and Decline <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The swap spread had been near, and market sentiment was slightly weak. Yesterday, the 13th, the gold standard slightly declined again. However, the state was peaceful, and the unified daily turnover was only a few taels of silver. Looking back, the amount of intraday trading was only slightly more than one tael. Foreign exchange was also weak and clumsy. Demand from fellow traders was scarce. As for the buying and selling of various firms, Yongheng bought a considerable amount, speculated by Luo, who shorted. Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongfuchang, and others were mostly sellers. The early market seemed slightly lower. The overseas silver market only showed a slight drop in large bars. The price of silver did not change further, and because the exchange rate fell, people's hearts were empty. Later, the sellers were overwhelmed, and suddenly the 90-tael mark was broken. Afterwards, Yuancheng, Yongyuanmao, Yongheng, and others continued to buy, but the Dalian gang and retail investors mostly sold out due to swap spreads or fears of a large increase. Therefore, the market price broke through 90 taels again. The short sellers were under strong bullish pressure, and the environment was forcing them to be stimulated. Afterwards, many sellers rushed in, especially as the exchange rate did not improve but loosened. The bank sold January English gold at 173.125, and suddenly the market turned downward, re-entering the 90-tael range. The following is a detailed record of the situation before and after the market.</p>
<p>Hovering around 90 taels. The opening price in the morning of December was 590 taels, a drop of 9 qian and 1 mao. The market was calculated at 89 taels. There were many buyers around 90 taels, probably because the large bar was down another 1/16, but the price of silver did not move. The British and Japanese exchange rates were down by 32/1, and the Japanese and American exchange rates were down by 16/1, so the market sentiment was weak. Then it fell another 3 or 4 qian, but Yongheng vigorously covered its shorts, so it was pulled up by a few qian to 90 taels and 3 qian. Yuancheng and Yongfuchang sold, and the sentiment in the market was poor, so it was difficult to sustain. The 90-tael mark was suddenly broken, only to 88 taels and 3 qian. As for bill transactions, only Dalian bills were absorbed by Mitsui, recently at 1 tael, 2 qian, 7 fen, and 625 hao, and it was not easy to sell. When the advance order was announced, the listed price was 88 taels, 8 or 9 qian, and there was no change. It fell again to 8 taels, 3 or 4 qian. The internal exchange rates were flat. Korea sold spot dollars at 38.875 yuan, which was bought by silver companies. Taiwan bought spot Dalian at 1 tael, 2 qian, 7 fen, and 5625 hao. The price of gold was around 89 taels. After 10:45, the trend seemed to be high, mostly because Yuancheng, Yongheng, and hedgers chased in, and the price rose by 1 tael. Sumitomo bought February English gold at 173.125. Zhongfu and Dongya mutually traded January prices. At 11:15, it rose to 89 taels and 9 qian, but Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yong, and retail investors sold out. Suddenly, it fell by 1 tael to 8 taels and 9 qian. Soon, it rebounded by 3 or 4 qian. At noon closing, it was 8 taels and 8 qian. The December English gold was traded between banks at 1725. Afterwards, there was a slight transaction of 4 or 5 qian, and the quoted price was still 623 taels and 4 qian, a discount of 34 or 5 taels.</p>
<p>The final result was a drop of 2 taels and 4 qian. The after-market opened at 89 taels and 3 qian, already up by 4 or 5 qian, because Yongheng still had buying. Then Yuancheng and others followed suit, and the price was pushed to 90 taels and 7 qian, then retreated by 8 or 9 qian. After 1:30, Taixing and Dadecheng entered the market, and buying gradually increased. It rose by 1 tael. At 3:00, it reached 91 taels, but there were few transactions at this price. In a blink of an eye, it fell by a few qian, because the bulls raised the price and released air, and the swap spread had to be 5 or 6 taels, which was enough to make the shorts feel cold, so they had to cover. However, bank drafts could still be supplied. Anda and Huabi did 1725 for November, and Huabi Bank sold 173.125 for January. However, there was little entanglement in the industry. Later, there seemed to be more sellers on the table. At 3:30, it fell to 89 taels and 2 qian, hovering around 90 taels. Around 4:00, Zhifeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, Yifeng, Yong, and others sold, so it plummeted by 1 tael and 6 or 7 qian. At 4:20, it was 88 taels and 4 qian. At the 4:30 closing, it was 88 taels and 5 qian, a drop of 2 taels and 4 qian compared to the previous day, which was a reversal of the three-day rise. The highest price of the day was 91 taels, and the lowest price was 88 taels and 3 qian, a difference of 2 taels and 7 qian. Looking back at the quoted price, the discount was 33 or 4 taels to 35 taels. The ledger was 98 taels to 89 taels. The water replenishment was 98 taels. The morning market for goods was 9 taels and 6 qian, the noon closing was 8 taels and 8 qian, the afternoon was 9 taels and 1 qian, and the closing price was 8 taels and 3 qian. The industry's entries and exits were very different. The transactions and disbursements of fellow traders were different. Yongheng covered more than 3,000 bars. Dadecheng, Yu Dayongchengchang, and Taikangrun all bought slightly. Yuancheng, Yong, Wanxing, Yifeng, Yongyuanheng, etc., had different entries and exits. Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Shengdashunli, etc., were mostly sellers. Goods were entered and exited from time to time. Taichang entered in the afternoon. Yongheng, Yuancheng, Yongyuanmao, Dadecheng, and Taixing all entered. Shunli, Wanxing, Yu Dahengxing, and retail investors all exited, and retail shorts covered. The Dalian gang broke even in the early market, totaling more than 400 bars. Later, 600 bars were sold, and more than 200 bars were entered. The Guangdong gang still had no large bills in and out.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market shrank slightly. The exchange rates between the United States, Britain, and Japan suddenly fell, but the Kobe market did not change. Transactions were limited. HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change, but the bank's transaction prices tended to loosen, probably due to the reversal after the gold standard rose repeatedly, and the 90-tael mark had been broken. The afternoon results compared to the previous day's closing showed that English gold was up 125, US gold was up 25, and Japanese gold was down 25. There were few transactions by Chinese merchants.

<p>The yarn market is calm, but actual sales are becoming more and more bleak. The intentions of various brokers are still slack, so the market situation is still not prosperous. However, the overseas cotton market is slightly firm. Due to the sluggish current demand in this port, most people's hearts are scattered. The seller's attitude is calm, and the situation will not change for the time being.</p>
<p>There is not much movement in the human standard. The early market for the human standard opened because the American cotton price rose again, causing the sellers to be slightly short, and all months rose by three or four qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the current yarn business was not prosperous, and the market situation was still soft, and all months did not rise or fall. The total transaction volume for the day was 11,100 bales. Check the outgoing amount: Hehe 650 bales, Yuantai 800 bales, Lichang 450 bales, and the rest 300 to 400 bales. Buy-in: Gongtai 700 bales, Sentai 700 bales, and the rest 200 to 300 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Cotton Market Rising Wind Gradually <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm and the rising air is relatively strong. In fact, the US cotton price has risen for two consecutive days, causing the sellers to be short of Japanese merchants buying in. Therefore, the table is tighter and the market atmosphere is rising. However, the current cotton transaction is still silent. All factories have no large purchases, and Indian cotton dealers are still willing to make concessions and sell. However, all factories are watching and not moving forward. The cotton market situation is more complicated. How to step back still depends on the US cotton as a advance or retreat.</p>

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived from various groups, and sales were very sluggish. Changbang new japonica rice was actually not prosperous and fell by 4 jiao. At the moment, the special top price is only 15 yuan. The thin rice is also tired by 2 or 3 jiao, and the top price is 15 yuan. At the moment, the japonica thin rice is not the main consultant, so it is becoming more and more tired. Yangxian recovered a small 3 jiao, and Dujian was short by 2 jiao. This time, the arrival of xian rice has been welcomed by people who are soft, and the production news is also withered, resulting in the market becoming tired. There is still a part of retail investors asking about the wharf, so the situation is flat and there is not much rise or fall change. Yuan Xiaoxiao went to two or three jiao, and the special top was 15 yuan and 4 jiao, and the situation was very stagnant.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived by river. The sales of various groups were extremely light. Changxi new japonica rice is still set at a special price of 15 yuan, and the medium and secondary prices need to be repaired by one or two jiao. The goods arriving in Shanghai for Suzhou and Tongbai japonica rice are mostly ordinary medium and close, causing buyers to not be greedy. The price continued to fall. Tongli rice was at 12 yuan and 89 jiao. The goods arriving in Shanghai for Nanbang early thin rice were not very prosperous. The top price was 13 yuan and 8 jiao. The general trend was the same as the previous day. Sheepxian Dujian customer sales and rural sales were all stagnant and tired. The board fell by two or three jiao. The top Duzi price was around 12 yuan. The arrival of Yin Yuan was more and more prosperous. The overall market fell step by step. The highest price was only opened at 13 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Flour Market Follows Standard Wheat to Fall <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, all months saw a once-flattering performance. The quoted price of foreign wheat rose by two or three jiao to seven jiao, causing the people inside and outside the industry to inevitably move. Floating space also resisted a very large number of shares. Although the highest price in this month was opened to 2 taels, 2 qian, and 3 fen and a half, the forward price was also better than the recent price. However, after the second market, it was slightly softer. When the market opened in the afternoon, the standard wheat fell sharply. The actual sales were not very smooth. The quoted price of spot goods from various factories has been difficult to pull up again. It is heard that the warship has opened a price of 3 qian, and this month is even more due to the selling of small factories, which is generally preparing to pay for the current situation, and people's hearts are relaxed. The standard is subject to environmental pressure, and it may be difficult to get rid of it temporarily. As a result, this month was a little smaller than the previous day by 1 fen and 7 li, December was smaller by 5 li, 1 and 2 months were smaller by 2 li and a half, and 3 and 4 months were smaller by 5 li.</p>

<p>Afternoon fell back three or five points</p>
<p>Yesterday, the period showed an initial firm followed by a tired image after opening in the morning and afternoon. At the beginning of this month, the opening price was as high as 2 taels, 5 qian, and 2 fen, because the foreign wheat reported well and people's hearts were slightly higher. However, due to the multi-party discharge, the empty households followed the market. It is heard that the multi-party release this month was actually slaughtered by the import of foreign wheat, because the market value of local wheat is still higher than the standard. As a result, this month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, December fell by 3 fen, January was unmoved, 2 and 3 months fell by 1 fen, and April was unmoved. Because of the lack of high-quality goods, the manufacturers of medium-quality goods have no idea, so the city has not opened. Also, it is reported that two new foreign wheat ships arrived yesterday afternoon, which were orders from Zhonghua, Shen Da, and Huafeng factories. The factories were dispatching and unloading, so a certain factory sold more than 30 cars of this month's period wheat on the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's area telegram reported that the current Cuban sugar price was 1.46875, which was an increase of 0.0625 compared to the previous telegram. The New York futures sugar price for December was 1.42, which was an increase of 2 points compared to the previous day. The price for March next year was still 1.53, the price for May was 1.6O, which was an increase of 1 point, and the price for September was 1.73, which was also lacking a mark.

The futures sugar price for November and December was 7.9375, which was also a drop of O0.0625 each. The price for January next year was still 8 shields. The various transactions in the Public Association market were quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was 7 taels, 7 qian, and 2 fen and a half, and slightly higher was 7 taels and 7 qian and a half. Fine sand white was 7 taels and 8 qian.

Only a few hundred boxes of domestic goods were opened by Yi mark at a price of 5 taels and 7 qian, and hand-picked goods were also scarce. It was reported that 23 packages of new Zhang Diao had arrived, which was already seen. It was the ice flower green made by the Xiamen factory of Baosha, not the new Zhang Diao.</p>

<p>The local silk market was booming because the silk weaving factories in Marseille and Lyon were mobilizing spring raw materials and the actual sales were developing quite well. The market for yellow and white factories and wild goods was trending upwards. Since the financial turmoil in France, banks have been collapsing and the economy has been unstable, causing the raw materials of silk weaving factories to also suspend mobilization. The Shanghai silk market has been greatly affected, and the market price has been trending downward. Yesterday, only English Zhuang, Anli De Zhuang, and Meizuishi and other banks entered Jiading scarf, Xi'an wrist, and Sichuan silkworm cocoons, etc., for two or three hundred dan. The price fell by two or three taels compared to the previous one.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port did not make much progress. Major green teas such as Zhenmei and Gongxi did not have large transactions. People's hearts were tired and the market price fell step by step. Only the Show Eyebrows item was quite searched by Yongxing Fushi and other banks yesterday, and the selling price was extremely low. Although the Xiamu Pearl Tea Jinlong Foreign Bank had a slight appetite, the recognized market was still low. The Russian banks' intentions for Qi Ning and other red teas became weaker, and there were no transactions in the whole city.</p>

<p>The market price of cotton cloth from this factory has been gradually decreasing due to sluggish actual sales. The price of fine twill continues to fall daily. Yesterday, "Yanghe" dropped past "Lan Shuangyu," selling for six taels, seven qian, seven fen, and a half. "Lan Shuangyu" still requires six taels and eight qian because merchants from Guangdong are still procuring it. The fluctuations in the price of goods are truly unpredictable. Fine cloth is visibly declining. "Lan Feiyu" is at six taels and nine qian, "Caiqiu" at six taels, six qian, and a half, and "Yanghe," "Lan Shuangyu," "Labatong," all at six taels and six qian. "Lan Ji" at six taels, four qian, and a half is already willing to be sold off. Coarse twill, which once seemed firm, has also reversed its upward trend and is now declining. "Maoying" sold for five taels and three qian yesterday, "San Yu" for five taels, two qian, and a half, and "San Tu" for five taels and two qian. Only coarse cloth is still somewhat satisfactory. "Hubei Tianzi" still has no spot goods. "Lihe" is selling for seven taels and three qian. Eleven-pound cloth has slightly fallen, while a large number of ninety-pound cloth from Ningbo and Wenzhou were purchased yesterday, mostly at prices around four taels, one qian, and a half. The market conditions for both Eastern and Western piece goods have seen a sharp drop in prices in recent days. Goods that were previously scarce from the East have been arriving in Shanghai one after another, but actual sales are far below previous levels, making it difficult for prices to stabilize. Yesterday, fine broadcloth suddenly saw a downward trend. "Huxinting" fell from three qian, one fen to three qian, five li. "Huanle" fell from three qian, seven li and a half to zero qian, two li and a half. "Yuehua" velvet is down two and a half li. "Zhonghua" velvet is consistently at one qian and nine fen, "Dahua" velvet at two qian and two li and a half. Printed velvet is even more depressed. Zhigong ni (tribute cloth) is arriving in Shanghai in large quantities. "Santan" is at three qian, five fen and a half, "Lieyan" at three qian and three fen, "Moganshan" at three qian and two fen and a half, "Changbanqiao" at three qian and four fen, "Yipin" at three qian and two fen, "Shuangtonglu" at three qian and seven li and a half, "Jing'an Temple" at two qian and nine fen, "Sanyou" at three qian and five li.

<p>The current market supply of No. 26 English galvanized iron sheets is extremely scarce, while demand from various construction guilds is very strong.

<h3 id="e195">The Vanguard Weekly <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Issues 18 and 19</p>
<p>Besides the polemic on nationalism and poetry by Tang Bingruo and the continuation of "Two Orphans" translated by Bo Yi, these two issues of "The Vanguard Weekly" also include "Bloodstains" (essays) by Xiang Hua, "Miss Anjin" (fiction) by Guan Li, two book and newspaper reviews by Jin Xuan: (1) "The Short Story Magazine," July issue; (2) inaugural issue of "The Vanguard Monthly," and Jin Xuan's commentary on "Nothing." These are all rare masterpieces. It is truly commendable to be able to discuss exceptionally precise literary theory and creation in such a small publication. Now, I will analyze it from a literary perspective as follows.</p>
<p>Prefacing the two issues is the "On Nationalist Literary Poetry," seemingly an unfinished long treatise in form. However, after reading these two sections, we deeply understand the correctness of the author's argument and the richness of the content. The author provides a more detailed analysis and explanation of the significance of nationalist poetry, stating at the outset: "We can know that nationalist poetry already contained a full embryo in ancient China, and it did not begin with the present advocacy of the nationalist literary movement. In fact, we know that the emergence of any literary trend has its long historical background and the needs of the current social objective environment. As the highest artistic expression, poetry already possessed a strong national consciousness in primitive times. At present, China is suffering from the double oppression of imperialism, and the nation is withering to the extreme. Due to objective demands, nationalist poetry is bound to emerge." Words with such profound insights are indeed of great significance, but every sentence and word is based on historical facts and cannot be compared to other empty theories. Secondly, it lists the understandings of poetry from various schools, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. At the same time, after each definition, it adds a general explanation and uses a nationalist perspective to make a stern critique. Finally, it synthesizes the significance of nationalist poetry to obtain a clear indication, confirming several essential elements of nationalist poetry: (A) General national consciousness; (B) General ideas that promote national upward development; (C) The actual lives of the national people; (D) The principle of free rhythm. Although these four points proposed by the author with precision cannot be regarded as definite definitions, they have answered the conditions that nationalist poetry should possess.</p>
<p>Secondly, it describes the content of nationalist poetry. The author also provides a detailed explanation based on the important elements in poetry, such as thought, emotion, and imagination. In the content of nationalist poetry, the most important is, of course, thought. Therefore, the author states, "The most important thing in the content of poetry is, of course, thought. However, in expressing nationalist poetry, all ideas that hinder the upward progress of the nation, especially those so-called incorrect proletarian consciousness, should be excluded. In addition, otherworldly thoughts, religious thoughts, sentimental thoughts, decadent thoughts, romantic thoughts, feudal thoughts, etc., should not be incorporated into our poetry." We only need to look at this section on thought to understand the author's following exposition on emotion and imagination. Finally, the author describes the content of nationalist poetry as composed of three things: (1) the central idea of nationalism; (2) the emotion of national consciousness, which is further divided into two types: (A) social emotion; (Social　Emotion) (B) national sentiment; (National　Sentiment) (3) the creative imagination of nationalism. This is indeed a basic and important treatise on nationalist poetry.</p>
<p>Xiang Hua's essay "Bloodstains" is full of deep poetic meaning. The author's artistic skills are exceptionally humorous. In short words, it truly gives us supreme deep taste. The content describes a picture given by a friend, instructing him (referring to the author himself) to preserve it dearly, because it is the meaning contained in the achievements left by our predecessors. The author has already announced to us here, but what follows is many brilliant and unique points, containing infinite deep meaning, truly making us chew on it like delicious olives. After reading this article, we naturally and spontaneously recall the achievements left by our predecessors, a bloodstain.</p>
<p>"The pioneers are smiling and waving to me. I am treading on their bloodstains and rushing towards that solid fortress."</p>
<p>"I would like to add a little bit to this vivid bloodstain picture." This is the author's final description, which can reflect the strength of the entire article. Truly, "Bloodstains" is an extremely humorous essay.</p>
<p>Guan Li's short story "Miss Anjin" is equally worthy of our attention. In this creation, we can also see that the subject matter of nationalist literature has explored the social strata of other oppressed nations. In fact, this is also giving an important explanation to those who distort, insult, blindly scold, and do not understand literary trends. This is certainly clearer than explaining it with basic theories.</p>
<p>Miss Anjin is a woman from the oppressed Korean nation, not very old, about twenty-two or three years old. However, she has been resisting Japanese imperialism and striving for national movement for ten years. At the same time, the tragic death of her parents further accelerated her national movement. As a result, she finally bid farewell to the pitiful Korean people while awakening and encouraging songs. The author's descriptive skills are very strong. A lively pen focuses on Miss Anjin alone. Therefore, even when she was quickly dragged to the execution ground by those Japanese imperialists, it still depicts her explosive and powerful cry: "Arise, oppressed nations, unite! The Korean nation…" Generally speaking, such subject matter is very much needed in China, because our Chinese nation is also oppressed. The entire article is very compact and is indeed a good work.</p>

<p>"A Diplomatic History of the National Government" compiled by Hong Junpei of Yixing, has recently been published by Huatong Bookstore. The content is very rich, divided into sixteen chapters, describing the Shashki Incident, the Tariff Conference, the protest against the Hantao case, the Sino-Japanese incident in Hankou, the process of recovering concessions, the cancellation of the Russian recognition case, the Nanjing Incident, the Jinan Incident, the Middle East Road case, etc., without leaving anything out. It is truly a must-read for those concerned about diplomatic issues.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Reflections After Viewing the Japanese Children's Art Exhibition <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>I recently visited the "National Japanese Children's Excellent Painting Exhibition" held at the Kimura Company (art supplies and stationery store) on Wusong Road twice. The works on display were mainly crayon paintings (detailed later), crayon drawings, and watercolors. Although in that small exhibition venue, amid not-so-perfect displays, those paintings created by tender hearts and hands did indeed greatly stimulate my interest. At the same time, I was able to glimpse the development of artistic concepts among Japanese elementary school children in recent years.</p>
<p>Originally, this exhibition had already been held in Japan. This was the fourth national children's painting exhibition, mainly sponsored by the Ousama Trading Company and Sakura Trading Company. It is a regular practice to solicit works from children nationwide every year.</p>
<p>This time, 121,905 pieces were collected in Japan, of which only 1,600 were selected. The strictness of the selection can be seen. Only a part of this shipment was brought to Shanghai for the exhibition, only 123 pieces selected from over a thousand. This time, it was originally intended to give Japanese children in Shanghai the opportunity to compare and study the achievements of children's paintings in their home country, so it was specially transported for exhibition.</p>
<p>Although they are children's paintings, they are extremely careful in their handling of the appraisal. Therefore, the review is solemnly entrusted to first-class masters in the art world and art education field.</p>
<p>The reviewers are Yamamoto Kanae, Nakagawa Kigen, Ishii Hakutei, Adachi Gen'ichiro, Kimura Shohachi, Nabeshima Katsuyuki, Harada Ryuutei, Sakui Yasaburo, Yamagata Hiroshi, Otake Sesso, Ishikawa Toraji, Itakura Sanji, Yokoi Soichiro, Itagaki Shigeki, and Sato Heitaro.</p>
<p>Moreover, each piece of work has a label attached with the seals of the reviewers, and the reviewers' thoughts or comments are written on the excellent works to show their responsibility in the review. The sponsoring organization gives considerable rewards to the excellent works to encourage them.</p>
<p>Children's art exhibitions have been frequently held in Japan in recent years. The organizers are various, including the education sector itself, as well as newspaper companies and other cultural organizations, all of whom are enthusiastically involved. It is said that the Ousama Trading Company (a company that sells painting supplies) alone has recently collected more than 230,000 children's paintings. This alone is enough to get a glimpse of its vigorous state.</p>
<p>Speaking of the paintings I saw at this exhibition, most of them were crayon paintings, crayon drawings, and watercolors. There were many excellent works in the whole collection, so I cannot record them in detail one by one. I can only describe the general trend.</p>
<p>Although they are the achievements of elementary school students, they are expressed innocently and clearly, showcasing a "display of the children's world." There are descriptions of sports meets, children's games, processions of soldiers, scenes seen on the streets, scenery of villages and gardens, characters and lives in families, school scenes, snow-covered villages, city roads, buildings, flowers, fruits, etc. The subjects are depicted in extremely freehand ways with very bright colors—vibrant yellow, red, azure blue, deep green, tea brown, peach red, black and white. The works have a very varied color palette, vividly expressing their impressions of the world. In particular, the unique drawing method of crayon paintings skillfully utilized by their small hands is very interesting.</p>
<p>"Craypas" is a type of pigment pen created in Japan in recent years. Its properties have the characteristics of both "colored crayons" and "pastels" (colored chalk). It can also be said to be a type of nearly solid oil painting pigment, shaped like a pastel tube. It is free and convenient to use, but it is better than traditional colored pencils and crayons. This type of craypas can produce the following effects:</p>
<p>Rich and smooth lines</p>
<p>Gradations that can be freely blended</p>
<p>Free mixing of colors</p>
<p>Bright colors can be added on top of dark colors</p>
<p>It can also be mixed and thinned with turpentine oil to create a variety of mixed colors.</p>
<p>Some of the paintings I saw this time had fine lines scratched out on the thickly applied craypas color to create patterns. I think this shows an unusually interesting effect in the depiction of patterns or decorations.</p>
<p>Overall, I am impressed by several points of the Japanese children's paintings this time: the vivid expression of impressions, the free expression of subjects based directly on children's own perceptions, and the "freedom" and "abundance" in the application of expression techniques. This can indeed prove the progress of Japanese elementary school art education in recent years.</p>
<p>However, the reason why it can tend toward this trend and develop is not without reason. Looking back at its origin, it seems that we have to go back to the "Free Painting Movement" advocated by Western-style painter Yamamoto Kanae ten years ago.</p>
<p>Originally, Japanese elementary schools were still practicing model education. Elementary school students learned to draw by copying models. In fact, this method can only make children practice pen techniques mechanically and cannot inspire children's perceptions of "nature" expression. Although there are occasional sketching courses, they are based on the traditional, rigid teaching method. At most, they can copy the model to the fullest extent, but they cannot allow children's own perceptions and personalities to be expressed in creation. At that time, Mr. Yamamoto keenly pointed out various malpractices and vigorously advocated reform movements. For a time, there were many who resonated with him, and opponents also showed considerable momentum. At that time, various discussions were aroused in the education sector. However, after all, this matter concerned the life and death of the future of art education, so they did not hesitate to work hard to overcome difficulties. Mr. Yamamoto wrote a long article to thoroughly refute all the opponents. At that time, he and Katagami Shinn, Kishibe Fukuou, Kitahara Hakushu, Nagahara Kotaro, Tani Yoshio, Kanai Masayama, Yamagoe Kyozo, and others organized the "Japan Children's Free Painting Association." Later, they also published the magazine "Artistic Free Education" to vigorously innovate the methods of children's art research. At that time, major news agencies all gave unusual support to the repercussions and held exhibitions in various places to promote this movement.</p>
<p>The first "Free Painting Exhibition" to be piloted was held in April of Taisho 8 (i.e., 1919) at the Kanzawa Elementary School in Kamikawa Village, Agata County, Mr. Yamamoto's hometown. Before long, sympathizers successively opened several exhibitions in various places such as north and south Shinano, Tokyo, Tanba, Kyushu, and Osaka. At that time, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun hosted a "Japan Children's Free Painting Exhibition." Subsequently, the Osaka Asahi Shimbun also hosted a "World Children's Free Painting Exhibition." Moreover, the Asahi Shimbun used the summer lecture to carry out exhibitions and lectures in a total of thirty-five places across Japan and worked hard to promote its beautiful intentions. This was the situation at that time.</p>
<p>In less than a few years, this reality has naturally been discovered in elementary school education throughout Japan. Since then, children's self-painting exhibitions have been commonly held. However, now there seems to be no need to mention the words "free painting," and people know that this method is pure and reasonable for inspiring children's artistic perceptions.</p>
<p>Seeing their current achievements, one cannot help but think of Mr. Yamamoto Kanae's contributions. Although many people do not pay much attention to this matter, it has given a great contribution to children's art education, which cannot be denied. Mr. Yamamoto was originally an artist and not an elementary school art teacher, but in terms of this matter, that is, the reform of art education, he is indeed a pioneer. The good influence of Western-style painting development can also be seen here in the art education given to elementary schools.</p>
<p>Here, I will try to record a part of the prospectus of the intent of Mr. Yamamoto Kanae's advocacy of "free painting" at the time (late March of Taisho year).</p>
<p>The children's painting education practiced in various elementary schools has generally been "copying paintings" and "sketching" methods. Here, what I call "free painting" refers to including sketching, memory, imagination, etc., that is, directly expressing the work without the help of a copybook.</p>
<p>According to the traditional teachings, children spend more time copying adults' paintings that have undergone crude printing than directly absorbing shapes or colors from "nature." I think this is wrong. Why? Because, for example, a meaningless line on a copybook will have the same power as a beautiful and living tree line in the minds of children. They will honestly imitate whatever reason there is. Therefore, if withered copybooks are given to them to copy, the eyes and hands of the children will also become withered. If the eyes of children are guided to the abundant "natural world," their hearts and hands will naturally become lively. This is also proven by the fact that the paintings of children before school age are generally active and vivid.</p>
<p>In short, in children's painting, it is wrong to encourage them to have the same observation power as adults. Children must be allowed to open up, especially in terms of artistic cultivation.</p>
<p>"Beauty," if it only relies on the cultivation of teachers, will eventually fall. It is our task to completely take back the future of Japanese art and art crafts from the hands of those old-fashioned artists who seem to have been created from copybooks and powder books. After all, what is the purpose of teaching writing, painting, and music together with arithmetic, geography, etc. in elementary schools?</p>
<p>It goes without saying that it is to cultivate noble human-like "beauty" sentiments along with knowledge. If all human beings have strong physical strength, bright appearance, sufficient knowledge, and suitable careers, isn't that a remarkable phenomenon? Moreover, if everyone is a poet, an artist, and a musician in their sentiments, then it is truly heaven. Although such a heaven is like a "fool's dream" among us today, no one would rather go in the opposite direction, just as no one is willing to go towards poverty.</p>
<p>In short, people are constantly seeking "creation" and "nurturing." Where these two progress extremely smoothly, one cannot help but feel that a healthy culture can be built.</p>
<p>I aim to make our art and art crafts the smoothest things and feel that this matter really must start from children's painting education.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I think we must sweep away the malpractice of adults only copying powder books and children only copying copybooks. Instead of giving copybooks to children to imitate, it is better to freely graze them in "nature" and force them to produce. This matter will also be of interest to adults, but it is also meaningful to children. Children, in relation to "nature," will probably create paintings directly on the one hand and independently understand "beauty" on the other hand. "Beauty" is indeed something of this nature, just as sexuality will also imply in the chest of a young man without giving him a copybook. This is the secret of nature and the profound wisdom of the gods. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>In addition, there are various documents on free painting education. Mr. Yamamoto's "Key Points of Free Painting Education" is exceptionally clear and will be introduced again at the next opportunity.</p>
<p>As for how the achievements of elementary school art education in our country are in recent years, I naturally cannot have a definite judgment because I have never studied it.</p>
<p>However, regarding this aspect, I can also base it on having seen the painting achievements of many elementary school students and according to what friends who are directly teaching elementary school students have told me about the situation of elementary school art classes. Moreover, two or three years ago, I taught art classes at the attached middle school of a certain university for a few months, so I can also infer one aspect of the art achievements in recent years. According to this situation, I know that most elementary schools in our country are still copying copybooks perfunctorily with one or two small books. Moreover, schools do not seem to pay much attention to this curriculum. Also, due to the set time, equipment, and teaching, etc., it does not seem to make students feel any interest.</p>
<p>According to the situation of the art class in the attached middle school that I directly saw, although the middle school also had several plaster statues and models, it was also strange that there was no art classroom. Students had never had any cultivation in even the simplest sketching. How they learned to paint in the schools they had attended before, they said that the teachers only taught us to copy copybooks or to copy some pictures cut out from magazines. They only had such experience, so it was very difficult for them to start learning to sketch from scratch in the one-hour art class each week. Even the students found it exceptionally difficult and did not know where to start when facing the real thing. One of them saw the real thing for sketching and said, "How can you teach us to draw like this, teacher? Why don't you draw it on the blackboard for us to copy?" This statement shows nothing but his imitative habits since elementary school. I didn't feel it was particularly strange either because they had never had any beneficial training in art classes in their previous preparations in elementary school. All they had was perfunctory copying for one or two hours. Therefore, they couldn't draw anything without a drawing book. This habit seems to be prevalent in elementary schools in our country. This is not surprising because most elementary schools seem to arrange the art curriculum as usual. As for why they want to inspire children's "sense of beauty" and how to inspire their expression of the sense of beauty, it seems that they have never considered it, and they don't even know the necessity of this consideration. Therefore, many students perfunctorily deal with this curriculum, and the school authorities do not criticize any situation and think that it is just a general communication.</p>
<p>Originally, the purpose of the school's art class was not to train children to be professional artists. Its purpose was nothing more than to inspire children's "sense of beauty," that is, to make them wake up their beautiful eyes and minds to the beauty of phenomena, shapes, and colors, to make them perceive and express according to their own perceptions, and to induce their "creative feelings." This was originally not to train them to be painters.</p>
<p>Even so, how much effectiveness can the copybook teaching method have for this purpose? I think that the copybook can only unconditionally make children copy some strokes, and its image is not something that originates from the interest of the copying child himself. No matter how well (or like) it is copied, it is not enough to prove that it is the experience of the child's own sense of beauty. He probably cannot discover anything that he has perceived himself, so he does not reveal his emotions about the phenomenon. Therefore, copying can only make students develop the habit of imitation and cannot make students generate creative attempts. Therefore, there is a reason why drawing models cannot serve as art guidance here. Good drawing models can at most serve as a reference for students, but they cannot be directly given to students to copy.</p>
<p>Children have their own feelings and observations. Teachers can only guide them well, give instructions and explanations, and make their perception power be inspired, but they cannot make them blindly follow the works of teachers or models. In short, directly trying and inspiring students' perception power is to make students grasp a kind of power. Therefore, directly facing the real thing (or the real phenomenon) and making them freely describe it according to their own perceptions is to make this power natural and expanded.</p>
<p>This method is not to encourage their depictions to tend toward strangeness, but to inspire the perception power that they each have and to make them naturally express it according to pure love.</p>
<p>Among the middle and primary schools in our country, there are probably some schools that truly handle art classes well, but it seems that only a few. In the past, most educators in our country thought that the art class was dispensable, so how the achievements are is not what they want to ask about. Moreover, there are many people who only think of children's painting as a waste of time without thinking about the great relationship between the study of painting and children's sense of beauty. These situations are also because the education sector in our country has not sincerely paid attention to the matter of "art education." I hope that all those who work hard directly in art education will innovate in this area in the future to make it develop.</p>
<p>Finally, as a side note, here is a piece of news: recently, the Japanese side in Shanghai, considering that children in Shanghai lack an art environment and cultivation, specially advocated their painting creation. The "All Shanghai Children's Free Painting Exhibition" will be hosted by the "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun." The first exhibition will be held on the 15th and 16th of this month (November) in the auditorium upstairs of the newspaper (corner of Wusong Road and Tang En Road). (The collection of works will be from the 5th to the 10th, and the review will be carried out by Japanese painter Ogawa Ando and others.) The results cannot be predicted, but I hope that people who pay attention to children's art education can get some references at this opportunity.</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e199">The First Works of Literary Giants <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>It is very interesting to compare the circumstances under which various literary giants published their first works.</p>
<p>Strindberg - At the age of twenty (1870), he wrote the scripts "Hermione" and "The Wanderer," which immediately attracted people's attention. King Charles XV of Sweden specially awarded him an annuity to encourage him. At this time, he entered the school that he had stopped due to poverty, but soon Charles XV died and the annuity also stopped, so he had to fall into extreme poverty again.</p>
<p>Hauptmann - He didn't publish his first long narrative poem "Prometheschulos" until he was thirty-three years old, but he knew that his poems were not yet mature, so he argued in the bookstore to sell them, and then collected and burned all the leftovers. Four years later, he published his masterpiece "Before Sunrise."</p>
<p>Artsybashev - In 1901, he wrote his first work "Pasha Zhamarov," which wrote about the real events of an old abandoned school and hinted at his hatred. This work was approved by a famous review magazine and promised to publish it, but at that time, the inspectors routinely prohibited works about schools, so this work had to be shelved. However, the editor was very surprised by his career and encouraged him to start writing a second work. At this time, he realized his initial dream of becoming an artist and devoted himself to literature.</p>
<p>Ibsen - At the age of fourteen, he was an apprentice in a pharmacy. He lived well for ten years. In 1848, when he was twenty years old, the revolutionary ideas of Europe were very popular, which greatly influenced his young heart. At this time, he was just a pharmacy apprentice, and he worked every night under the candle to write in praise of the revolution. In this way, he wrote his first work, the three-act tragedy "Catalina." In 1849, he left the pharmacy and began to volunteer as an artist. At the age of twenty-two, he got his friend Schuler's help to publish his "Catalina" under the anonymous name "Brynjolf Barm" at his own expense, but at that time, only thirty copies were sold.
