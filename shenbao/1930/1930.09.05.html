<p>南美各國。已有革命潮流然今日之政局不安。不但南美各國而已日本之精查會。已入緊張之態。其敵黨之政友會。開始倒閣之運動英國工黨内閣。亦因失業問題不能與自由黨一致。將陷於孤立之地位。澳洲政府。恐因預算案而引起政潮。是各强國政局之不安定。多有此現象不僅南美各國已也。加之國際之間。法意之不睦。又復顯露。是又至可注意之者。</p>
<p>至若殖民地之騒動。印度自非武力抵抗以來。至今仍無適當處置之方法。而安南之暴動又復迭起法兵在斐洲之摩洛哥。又因士人叛變而死傷。是殖民地之人民。無一不躍躍欲試。以求恢復其獨立與自由。此其情形。斷非短時期所能獲得。亦非短時期所能平息。故今日之世界。誠可謂多事之秋也。</p>

<p>爲什麽一個女子和男人接吻的時候。要閉上了伊的眼睛。這個問題很容易解决。因是這是人類的一種自然的天性的舉動。像一條麽鹿看見了獵人的蹤跡。掩躱在樹林中一樣的一種可笑的行爲。</p>
<p>普通的女子。平均地說差不多把半生的光陰。耗費在（閉眼睛。）假裝着不知不見。因爲伊知道。假使把伊内心一切的所有給男子們知道了的時候。男子們再不會戀戀於伊的了。</p>
<p>假使一個女子明白地告知了伊的男子說。伊是愛他。這一定會把他嚇住或者使他感着痛苦。假使伊告知了他伊並不愛他。那末這會傷了他的虚榮。壤了他的自尊之心。所以伊只有閉上了眼睛。拿一個悶葫蘆給人猜。</p>
<p>世界上只有未來的事最易動人的心魄。夢想的事最易激動人的興趣。一個悶葫蘆能使人赴湯蹈火而不辭。女性之所以能顚倒衆生。只在乎這一著。</p>
<p>怕老婆並不是男子的美德。而同時决討不着女子們的歡心。因爲大多數的女子决不會愛一個甘作雌伏的男子。而女子的希望。是要有一個勇敢善斷的保護者啊。</p>
<p>戀愛是神聖的。可是戀愛之中。時常發生了罪惡。這罪惡之淵源。就是因爲是人們不能了解神聖的戀愛之故。</p>
<h3>胡漢民宅中之無線電話機</h3>
<p>— 李慶多</p>
<p>邇來科學昌明。無線電話已成爲一種極普通之交通器械凡相距數千里舟車往來需時多日者。可於數十分鐘内互通聲息。不可謂不便利矣。無線電話機。外國用者殊多。就美國言。據聞居户用者幾逹十之六七。其普遍可知。國府立法院長胡展堂氏。爲求消息靈通起見。特在首都私邸裝置無線電話機所費機價計二百餘金。式樣新頴收音淸晰。胡氏每於公餘之暇。一聽無線電話所有空中各種聲浪。均能隨意收聽近者如首都要人之演講。遠者如小呂宋劇團之唱戲等。當其用無線電話播音時。悉能一一淸聽。故胡氏雖每日公事繁忙。而其宅中得有此種娛樂。爲暇時之消遣。精神上殊爲愉快。消息尤極靈敏也。聞財政部因欲獎勵國内採用此種無線電話機近已下令此物出入口准予免稅云。</p>
<h3>歐化之西子</h3>
<p>— 何海生自杭寄</p>
<p>近吾國婦女。大多短髮長襪。革履旗袍。傾向於歐化。姿態婀娜。楚楚動人。至於吾杭之西湖素以湖光山色稱勝天下。昔東坡居士有詩云。「若把西湖比西子。淡裝濃抹總相宜。」故西湖又名西子湖。乃以富翁優游其間。於是洋房林立。並建築馬路改造橋樑等等。而西子湖亦漸成歐化矣。</p>
<p>日前工務局長朱耀庭氏。將斷橋殘雪處之石碑拆去。以利交通。西湖十景遂缺其一。比者巿長蔡增基氏。對於建設西湖。亦多所擘畫完成環湖地瀝靑馬路。建築三潭印月平湖秋月阮公墩。湖心亭四處公共禮堂裝置環湖電燈。建築葛嶺觀象臺建築船埠碼頭。增設汽油機器擺渡船。俾游覽節省時間。設立游湖指導招待所。所有一切建築工程均用科學方法。以人工藝術造成。已飭工務局設計辦理。使西湖風景。可媲美於歐美。自後西子湖之天然勝景。將全趨新潮流而蔚爲歐化之美矣。短髮蓬蓬。革履𣓷𣓷之時�婦女。來游西子湖者。不啻與西子爭研鬭艷也。一笑。（即酬）</p>
<h3>樂平之民風</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>

<h3>我所知之皖匪三條腿</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>讀三十日本刋。有文俠君所著之廣德匪首三條腿一文。述其事甚詳。曩家居歙縣時。知其事尤稔。因筆之以實自由談。</p>
<p>三條腿。初無藉藉名。歙縣人。氏汪先世本極華貴及三條腿。已門庭衰落。無復當年豪槪矣。三條腿。生性奇僻。好作狹巷之游。糼讀書書塾時能以二手二足抵撑狹之牆而登其屋巓。同儕咸神其技。稍長。學茶葉業。皖中茶。葉肄。例多帶賣桐油。自作棧以至店肆亦有相去里許者。故所雇學徒皆須孔武有力。藉任搬運之責。在他人每桶桐油。須由二人打運而三條腿則否。以肩承之而行。步履如恒也。居常以鐵皮裏膝踝間習以爲常。日久。健步如飛。一旦卸去鐵皮。尤有瞬息百里之槪。此三條腿命外之由來也。特三條腿自業商以來仍不减其狹巷斜行之故態。屢遭經理之斥。憤而去店。時皖中盜賊蠭起。民間有舉行自衛團之舉。以是三條腿得投身徽寗縣自衛團充警士。其神繪之技。於焉學得。然自是而後。歙縣已不復見其踪跡。初不意其意淪爲匪人也。不侫五年前因事去皖。自後未嘗一返故鄕。魚雁多洪喬之誤游子時興鄕關之悲。近來家報。每謂匪禍遍地。讀俠君此篇。誠不禁感慨係之矣。夫以三條腿之身懹絕技。乃含正途而弗由。徒爲閭閻害。殊爲之忱惜弗置也。</p>
<h3>瓜田慘劇</h3>
<p>— 顔也</p>
<p>鄕人種瓜恒於田間支榻設帳。名曰瓜舍日夜坐臥其中防竊瓜兒也今歲浙之慈北瓜舍。中發生猛獸食人。事殊奇慘爰誌之。</p>
<p>慈北有農民張某歲必種瓜蓋亦農之副産也今歲種西瓜三畝收穫豐。盈故雖夜宿瓜田日擔瓜入巿。晨夕辛勞。猶不覺其苦。前月某日。張載瓜赴巿。預計必信宿始能返。臨行乃以夜間守瓜田之責付諸其妻。夫出妻代勞此常事也張僅一妻一子。子猶未及十齡。及晚。妻即鍵户率子同入瓜田。星月皎皎。晚風習習。母子淸譚。至以爲樂。久之。兒倦。酣然入夢。母覺岑寂。亦入睡鄕。旣而宵深。臥榻忽震撼母驚覺睡眼中覩一癇然巨獸登床。駭極欲呼忽其子慘哭已被銜去矣母惶急萬分。載呼載逐。獸行疾。不可及。且轉瞬已不見。暗黑中惟聞其子慘號。仍循聲逐去不久聲又寂然矣。乃立而長號。宵深曠野。何來援者。旣將伯之無助爰疾行以返家喚起鄰右。告以所遇。於是數十壯者。燃燈持械。隨母出逐。踏破鐵鞋。何處獲得。擾攘終宵。徒勞而已。旣而黎明矣。忽見章際碧血飛濺。衆又踏血前行。點點碧血。導衆至一叢林。則血更多。且獲白骨兩根。入林深處。現一頭顱。母俯視之面目依稀。固其子也。捧起大。號一慟幾絕。衆急扶母携頭。相率歸來。更急足入巿。走告張某張之悼痛。尤甚於妻。蓋彼年過半百。此子乃晚年弄璋。妻又已過産育之年。此後身世。彌覺可憐矣。</p>
<h3>家庭新識</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生編</p>
<p>近見報載滬上時有被人用强水潑傷頭面之事，按强水實有三種係强酸類，但不論硝酸硫酸鹽酸，均可用炭酸鎂解之，無敵牌牙粉即以炭酸鎂爲主成分，試以强水貯玻杯中，傾入牙粉立即變爲荷蘭水一般，失去腐蝕之性，是明證也，故凡强水潑傷皮膚，切勿用水揩抺，以致，擴大範圍，速用無敵牌牙粉，傾於其上，則强水盡被吸收，失去腐蝕之性，然後用水冲洗仍以牙粉撲之不但立即，止痛，且能愈後無瘢，若先用手或手帕揩抺，則皮膚因揩擦而起凹，凸不平，愈後即，不免有癈矣，</p>
<p>强水或醋酸蓚酸等，人口下嚥，無不立斃，但如速用無敵牌牙粉調水成乳狀灌之，令其咽下，則凡鎂乳到處，立即中和失去强酸作用，實能化險爲夷，如用無敵牌之開胃藥尤效，因係養化鎂所製，一容量能抵三，容也，</p>
<p>苛性逹或苛性加里或安母尼亞，灼傷皮膚，宜用硼酸水或檸檬酸水洗之，如一時難得，則用無敵牌之汽水冲洗立解（此種汽水即嗬蘭水以檸檬味者爲有效）更以無敵牌之乙種凍瘡膏搽之，</p>
<p>湯火灼傷，以無敵牌蠂霜敷之良效，或用無敵牌牙粉調西冷油或潤髮霜敷之亦能止痛消腫，不致化膿，</p>
<p>不論何種瘡癤，久不收口者，撲用無敵牌牙粉少許，隔宿即能結痂而愈，</p>
<p>火酒燈或火油爐，一時缺乏燃料，可用無敵牌花露水代之（栩）</p>
<h3>羅馬敎廷對於中國禮俗之異議（上）</h3>
<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>據最近巴黎時報所載羅馬要電敎廷裁判處（Saint-Office)近忽再行認定其一七一○年所下之判决。禁止討論天主敎可否容許中國人尊孔敬祖等禮一事。該判决謂此種禮俗乃變裝之偶像崇拜云云。</p>
<p>此電所關連之問題。由來甚遠兩百年前在華天主敎徒已因此大起爭鬥。轟動一時。今舊事重提。恐不免又將引起許多糾紛也。討論此問題之著作甚多。其中經過情形頗有興味。</p>
<p>查耶蘇派（Jesuites）在華立足之始在十六世紀中葉。自此時起即爲多米尼加派（Dominicains)之勁敵。此兩派在天主敎中盡人皆知代表兩種相反之趨向。耶蘇派重精神而忽視條文多米尼加派則以爲除聖經外一切皆妄誕兩派之衝。突旣因一聖書事鬥訟於西班牙宗敎法院而開其端。其要華之激烈爭擾自屬意中事一六三三。年西班牙多米尼加派因嫉妬耶蘇派在華傅敎之成功。亦大舉東來。到華後因揚言中國歷代帝王聖賢等均在地獄受罪。被淸廷禁令停止此類說敎。否則立即驅逐出境。</p>
<p>多米尼加派旣得志於華。愈遷怒於耶蘇。派詆其不當允許中國信徒繼續祀祖祭孔。保有其本來之迷信。一六四五年九月十二日敎皇英諾桑十世（Innocent）從。多米尼加派之請。傅旨禁中國天主敎徒舉行一切祭祀死者之禮。但旨下而耶蘇派不從至一六五六年三月二十三日敎皇亞歷山七世（AlexandreVII）又令耶蘇派解釋放任華人祀祖之故。</p>
<p>兩派之明爭暗鬥一直延展至康熙初年。其時東南各省常有告發西班牙多米利加派之不法行爲者。淸廷遂於一六六五年一月四日下令禁止一切天主敎之傅佈。宣敎師均交看守。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二六九）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>翠筠贖了身出來身體上總算是得到一點自由了。可是經濟上又變了壓迫。旣然那個客人不能討伊非賡續伊的娼門生活不可。那時候。好像一個解放了的農奴。要自己與家立業了。又好像一個新獨立的國家。一切的建設。都要籌備起來。這是非經濟不可的。但是你眼前要錢。馬上就有。娼門的債權團。早已環伺你的左右了。不過那是有很嚴苛的條件。和很厚重的利息的。翠筠是一個還膽小的人。不敢多負債。可是你要開一個新局面。自己獨力經營。舖一個房間而且還要掙一口氣。不能比了從前蹩脚。從前是個殖民地被保護國。現在旣已獨立了。也要擺出一點樣子來不要被人所笑。那就不能不講究一點中於這個好勝之心就不能不多掮一點洋鈿了。而且在那種社會中。就是一個勢利社會。呌做「小錢不去。大錢不來。」你倘然房間考究。設備完全。再加以一切行頭。都是最上等的。自然也可以吸收上等的客人。次一等的客人。往往震於他們的局勢恢宏。便不敢嘗試知難而退。一個規模狹小的客人。到了那裏。有點自慙形穢。倘然你是一個樓下房間設備也不大完全。冬天没有火爐。夏天没有風扇。客人來吃酒碰和要一樣没一樣房間。裏都是阿木林。呌化子老是站在房門口。客人踏進去。有點要皺眉頭。覺得在那個地方請客。做客人的也有些兒失面子。於是就弄了一班差不多點的客人來。常常閙到翻檯面。打房間。主客都遭了没趣。上等點的客人。到底没有那種事。所謂「工欲善其事。必先利其器。」凡百事情。都是如此。一個妓院何獨不然。翠筠這一番獨立的代價。也花了七八百塊錢。要是花運亭通這七八百塊。錢就可以本利淸償。剛舖房間的時候。生涯居然不惡。在花國中雖然擠不上頭等偉人之列。也可以算次等偉人。那時的堂子社會中。也分出文武兩派來。武的是飛揚䟦扈。好吵喜閙。裝束也是故作詭奇。文的却是嫺靜一派工應酬。善詞令。武的所唱是黑頭武生老生戲。文的是唱崑曲。唱靑衣但是那時候風氣。已經漸漸變了重武輕文了。那些胡調得一塌糊塗的姑娘。姘戲子。姘馬夫。許多客人。反喜歡呌伊。文靜的姑娘。他們談不來。反覺得没趣。所以在娼門中。就可以觀察世變。</p>

<p>漢標尙穏漢標前巿開盤以雨勢巨大、人氣緊張、各漲一二錢後以有一部份賣出而疲、收盤時天晴又跌、結果近跌五分、遠平、午後天氣放晴、多頭賣出、惟漢帮購進、結果各月平平全日成交統計四萬零三百担、查賣出恒益二千四百担、廣豐三千三百担義成二千一百担、茂記一千四百担、申新公泰源大同興協生元德漢豐九百担至八百担、買進愼昌三千三百担、和愼一千一百担、餘昶三千六百担、益成晋豐天昌榮興一千担至八百担茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>八月份英國原棉消費大減</h3>
<p>美棉減數最巨</p>
<p>三日倫敦電、八月份英國銷用原棉比較去年同期減少二萬四千包、以美棉減少三萬四千包爲最巨、埃及棉亦見激减、惟印棉及其他棉種均見激增、由此可見美棉地位之不穏也、</p>
<p>本年八月　去年八月　比較增减</p>
<p>美棉六０、０００九四、０００減三四０００</p>

<h3>糧食河下米巿堅定</h3>
<p>昨日閘北滬南兩米巿到源因雨仍稀、各消續見活動、破粳高貨仍乏、普通巿高開二十元零九角、較前盤約緊一角許、大勢須天晴方能轉定束新粳悉開十八元半、巿較向上、實緣頂缺而俏利也、薄稻乏到無交、新客尖巿形甚堅、各方進胃不弱、故此貨往後來源定鉅也、中午成交稍旺行情將逹十五元關口、大盤計好角左白元始終平定、頂貨打須十九元二三角之譜全日各擋因大雨連綿不息、河斛難開、交易寥寥無幾情勢雙方均稱堅定、</p>
<h3>洋米存薄見俏勢</h3>
<p>昨日洋米巿况、仍形穏挺因巿上存底不満萬包即回籠貨及米店囤買所有者爲數亦微、存底中以西貢一號較多、約有五千餘包、但貨主心思甚堅、不肯在此客秈湧到時賤脫、故統巿祇有寗波帮辦去大絞八百包、價十二元六角至十二元、</p>
<h3>贛秈新到五千包</h3>
<p>客秈湘米被阻乏到江西米來源甚佳、昨日又有新到五千多包南京新秈一百二十包、本街胃口尙可天津帮及鄉莊亦有少數辦去、但因來源可望逐見量暢、貨主亦求速脫致價又回小一二角、江西米共開出檅早二千包機晚一千包、早糙二十包、機早十三元九角十三元、次至十二元七角半、機晚十六元一角半至十五元三角早糙十一元南京新秈十二元八角云、</p>
<h3>北銷動標粉俏俐</h3>
<p>昨日粉巿、上下午開盤後、各月份巿面復呈俏利之象、本月份初開尙平、糙以北路客帮如秦皇島靑島等帮、抽去現粉二萬餘包、致本月份之期貨、自然又須軋緊、接近廠家之空頭、以爲銷路雖不甚豐惟北銷一動人心終覺向昂故遠近期之抵補、頗形急切、因此各月份之巿氣又復傾向多頭也結果本月份較前日漲一分半、十月份漲一分七厘半、十一月份漲一分七厘半、十二月份漲一分、正月份漲一分二厘半、正月份漲一分云、</p>
<h3>麥巿跟粉價重健</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面上午開盤後各月份巿面、因洋麥報價又小二三角、人心見疲、較前日收價小去二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、因粉巿實銷已動、由定轉俏故各月份之買氣、亦爲跟起較之上午、回好二三分不等、觀此後如粉巿續提、麥巿亦看穏局也結果九·十月份未動十一月份較好二分、十二月份好一分、正月份好二分、二月好一分、現麥巿面各廠因存底尙豐、鑒於巿上之兜售甚殷、到源又絡繹不絕、故一致觀望、有意擯小、所以全巿未開云、</p>
<h3>糖巿日車糖猛抬突漲</h3>
<p>昨日糖巿産電訉古巴現糖價仍一·二一八七五、紐約期糖九月份價一·一二比前電逐路二分、十二月份一·二一、比跌一分、明年三月份一·三一五月份一·四零各比跌三分、爪哇現糖價八·八七五、期糖九月份價八·七五十月份八·六二五十一月份八·五零、比前均無升沉公會市場劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白買氣仍靜惟以日糖之猛升、减價增高爲八兩一錢、高貨减八兩二錢至三錢、但要手寥寥、後未成交、巿形當覺堅穏、中砂白去化殊寥、七兩六錢、二零號七兩七錢、交易甚懈、日糖以明華廠决擬十二日停工煉製、而明治糖大批貨須於週六可到因是人氣更佳、多家乘機吸取猛抬、巿價突然狂漲、趨勢之迅速殊有飛黄騰逹之槪Ｎ嘜價自八兩零五分至八兩一錢二分半、明華ＹＰ嘜價自八兩一錢至八兩一錢七分半、ＹＴ嘜八兩至八兩零五分、最高至八兩零七分半、ＹＰＯ嘜七兩九錢至八兩Ｊ嘜八兩二錢、後巿至八兩三錢、交易頗盛、巿形當覺堅挺、糖廠有大里糖即裝貨開價日金五元、行家進意頗濃、但洋行方面雖已允去電、惟須待廠方回電作實、號盤有國貨五福氷開出數十箱、價元六兩七錢、巿形平平、統手氷六兩一錢、且乏人問津、巿氣甚爲萎靡、</p>
<h3>南北貨大式新桂圓狂跌十兩</h3>
<p>第二批漳州新同安桂圓已於前日裝到、數逹二千餘箱、昨日各號已次第開出、同安大式貨因到數過多、且新泉泡不日可到、人心向下、未開之前行盤異常紊亂、上落竟四五兩、結果號盤開跌十兩左右、中檔跌五兩許、下檔跌一二兩件、上檔開三十三四兩特檔稍加、次者照减、中檔二十五兩至二十二三兩、次檔十七兩至八兩不一、如數兌通、首批新生晒圓肉三十七兩、</p>
<h3>疋頭飛黄騰逹之東疋巿</h3>
<p>存底空虚…定價飛漲…開盤迭昂本機布日來巿面趨勢堅定、細布雖北帮去路見呆、但開價仍挺、昨藍飛魚售七兩三錢、藍雙魚彩天七兩、喇叭童陽鶴六兩九錢細斜紋被廣帮搜羅殆盡、故愈趨愈高、陽鶴已售七兩二錢半、藍雙魚六兩八錢七分半、組布九磅貨均四兩二錢、十一磅四兩七錢、十三磅之飛態寗波帮進一百五十件、爲五兩五錢半、十六磅五鶴昨杭帮頗有添辦、價售開七兩二錢、十八磅天字邇來到貨見缺、已漲至七兩八錢半矣、</p>
<p>東洋貨巿况大有飛黄騰逹之勢漲勢、之烈爲從來所未有實以滬上存底空虚、小行家多數均無現貨、大阪定價飛漲不已、致人心大昂、昨日開價一致飛漲古城會嗶嘰開三錢二分寶球三錢一分、湖心亭二錢六分、後台二錢六分半、東棉日信二行開出有四百餘件、直貢呢雙童塵已售開二錢七分半、長板橋三錢二分七釐半直貢緞第一切三錢、尙無現貨、鵲橋會飛馬童一致開二錢七分二釐半矣、較之今歲春令俱高起已逹二分鈿云、</p>
<h3>五金會司鐵重起漲風</h3>
<p>二百磅會司鐵、自匯率趨漲之後標準略見下降、近數日來、出口帮需胃漸動、而本街廠家點綴亦每因此每日成交總有六七百箱之鉅、但來源寥落、緣是有供不敷求之勢人心挺秀、巿氣膨脹、故每箱行情重漲數錢、刻如三井估二十兩五錢、豐裕二十二兩五錢美康二十二兩、喴厘二十一兩五錢其他雜牌估二十一兩、聞秋季生意發動、巿面前途、定有蓬勃之氣象也、</p>

<h3>大學裡底流行症</h3>
<p>— 珂</p>
<p>流行症也可以說是時髦症、就是害了這樣病的人、不但不以爲痛苦、也許還要自詡爲時髦呢、</p>
<p>的確、我們現在祇要隨便在上海那個大學裏、都可以觀察出這樣地現象寫情書、看影戲講閑話、逛馬路、</p>
<p>事實是可以這樣說、無論你走到地一位同學的宿舍裏、他或她的釘在牆上的紙做的插信袋裏、總插着很漂亮的信封上面寫着秀麗的鋼筆字、署名的地方、或是英文縮寫、或竟空着、這樣含有神秘色彩的信、同時、在門房裏在郵差送信來的時候、也可以發現很多類似這樣地信來、哈哈、假使你一封一封地拆開來欣賞欣賞、那眞夠你顚倒哩、</p>
<p>星期六星期日這兩天照例是休息的日子、但、平時旣不感着勞苦的大學生們當然是不須這無病的呻吟、所以在這兩天倒成爲他們的看影戲的大集合、有愛人的自然是他和她一對對地手挽着手兒降臨到富有誘惑力的影戲塲上、靜靜地陶醉着、那不曾找到對方的可只好降格相求邀幾位同性的朋友、去賞鑒那銀幕上的熱烈變愛、和醉心蕩魄的跳舞在回來或將睡的時候、又必須起一陣關於影劇的劇烈評論、</p>
<p>上課、當然是絕對的自由、即使在講堂上、他們的耳朶也不見得一定要聽講、逢着好的敎授、自然比較注意點若是推扳點的啊、同學們就老實不客氣的談起話來、安靜此的還是輕輕地談着笑着、頑皮些的簡直就打開喉嚨說亮話、在自修的時間、除了少數的眞在自修外、差不多都是東一句西一句的答訕着談笑或是某同學的家庭、或是某人的變愛、或天氣的寒暖、或衣服的好壤或那里底風景、或某人的品貌、盡是這一類無目的底談論、雖然有時也會激昂憤慨地談到社會國家的問題、或爲主旨的不合、竟發生劇烈底爭論、—但把寶貴的光陰、消磨在空論上、恐怕還是脫不了我們的光說不做的特有的民族性吧、</p>
<p>晚飯後、有些同學是喜歡在這時三五成羣的走到馬路上去散步、一面閒談着、一面眼睛不住地打掠左右前後的過往人們、或無意識地看沿街玻璃櫉内的陳列品、若是斜剌裏現出一個時髦女人的話、啊、那他們的眼珠就好像被電石吸住了一般、再也不會轉動了、必定要待她的影兒整個的消逝了、這才相對一笑、末了再加上幾句批評、</p>
<p>當然、枯寂沉悶底生活、是不能使熱烈的靑年們満足、—但、我以爲至少在追求興趣時、應當迴念到我們現在的民族前途、是不是需要這種麻醉的調劑、同時、更要深切地猛省、現在我們所處的國際地位、是不是允許你混混沌沌地過下去、</p>
<p>在這裏、我有一句緊要的話要講就是像現在這種環境下、我們靑年、尤其是知識份子的大學生、是負了發揚民族改造社會鉅大的使命的、所需要的不是趣味、是勤勞奮勉、磨練成堅毅的精神、健康的身體、預備着將來肩頭上肩起重大的責任來、</p>
<h3>蒙古的女人</h3>
<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>在習慣於山明水秀的江南生活的我們、一聽見有人說到蒙古兩字的時候、就會連想到那些廣漠無人的原野飛砂走石的天氣、以及積雪没踁的苦寒景象、而而視爲一日不可居的化外之邦、可是、在曾經到過那邊的人看來、倒並不覺得怎樣討厭、也許還有點特殊情味、値得我們回憶的呢、</p>
<p>我是十六年八月中旬到外蒙去的、目的是在考察古物、可是每當掘骨頭拕砂泥的餘暇、也常常留心到這班所謂北地胭脂的一舉一動、以至她們的苦樂和風俗習慣等等、倒還有可紀的地方、現在趁這印象還未消失的時候、拉雜寫下一點來以供參考、</p>
<p>成見限住了我們的眼光常以爲祇有江南一帶方産美人、殊不知遠處牛羊毳幕間的婦女們竟有許多北地胭脂勝過南朝金粉、她們有的是懸胆般的高高鼻子、配著長長的眼睛、和大的鵝蛋式面孔、一官齊整中見出爽利的丰神、身材碩長、體格健强、從進化的審美眼光看去、這些都是蒙古女人獨具的優點而是吾輩江南女人所缺如的、每見她們的姑娘們、穿著棗紅緞子的長袍、和一張不曾被鉛粉剌傷過的臉孔、矯矯然走向我眼前來的時候、彷彿是一顆奇麗的好花開放在無人賞識的荒漠中似的、我驚訝著造化的無私他的給與、竟不因關山的間隔、而有所吝惜的啊、可惜是等到她們一做了婦人之後、就不同了、胭脂的猩紅塗得皮膚起了栗紋、白粉的鉛質使面孔變成黄色、並且頂上所盤的髮髻不常梳理、以致遠看竟像一個鳥窠、她們都很勞苦凡是拾糞擠奶、搭幕縫衣種種的日常勞作、都由她們担負、男人們終日無所事事、只揑著一根旱烟管高坐談天或是趕趕牲口就完了、雖然、他們的對待女人、無故用皮鞭打老婆是常有的事情、她們認丈夫打她便是愛她的證據倘然一個新娘在過満一年當中、還不是嘗過一次皮鞭滋味的那就是不得愛幸的薄命人了、曾有一個在庫倫做生意的山西人、娶了一位蒙古的姑娘、這位姑娘的家境很好、可是她們賠嫁女兒的奩具、除并狐裘一襲和棉褲兩條之外、他無長物、那丈夫却不以此爲介意、依然用一個漢族男子的愛情去愛他的妻子、然而她總覺得鬰鬰不樂、旁人也莫知其故或以爲她和他的性情不投罷了、有好事的不知用什麽方法去激怒了她的丈夫以致他在喝醉之後把她打了一頓第二天、她就手執利剪、把自己所穿的棉褲一層層的拆開、從密密縫著的棉絮當中、取出了二十塊光洋去獻給她的丈夫、作爲她對於他愛悅的表示、於是知道這兩條棉褲當中的嫁資竟是不少的咧、那姑娘又向人誇耀說他的丈夫現在是喜歡她了、這種情形、、只要曾在蒙古地方住過一月以上的就知道我在此並不曾說謊不過、這些、也頗有例外他們中間的老太婆們、也是極其利害之至的、照習慣這幕幄中的西北角上是鬼神的所在禁止人們觸犯的、如其有人不知道而貿然坐到這神聖的西北方去的時候、客氣點是推你出外、否則就只有飽你以老拳了、有一次、我一時粗心、犯了規則了、男子們汹汹然就要來拉我、我無法、正想用話解釋、但是那些男子突然一齊站住了、並且低了頭、象要等待懲罰似的、我反而弄得莫明其妙起來、忽然一個皺紋満面的老太太出現在幄門口了、她用手指著那班人、據我所聽得出的、大約是這樣的意思、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Political Instability in Various Countries and Their Colonies</h3>
<p>The situation in South American countries already involves revolutionary tides. However, the current political instability is not limited to South American nations. The Japanese Seiyukai has entered a tense state, and the opposing party, the Seiyukai, has initiated a movement to overthrow the cabinet. The British Labour Party cabinet is also facing isolation due to its inability to reach a consensus with the Liberal Party on unemployment issues. The Australian government is concerned that the budget proposal may trigger political turmoil. This phenomenon of political instability in major powers is prevalent and not confined to South American countries. Furthermore, the discord between France and Italy has resurfaced, which is also a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>As for colonial unrest, India has yet to find a suitable solution since its armed resistance began. Disturbances in Annam continue to erupt. French soldiers in Morocco, Africa, have suffered casualties due to the rebellion of local intellectuals. The people of the colonies are eager to attempt to regain their independence and freedom. This situation will not be resolved or quelled in a short period. Therefore, the world today can truly be described as a time of great turmoil.</p>
<p>In times of commercial decline and widespread unemployment, even stable nations are prone to disturbances. The potential causes of unrest are numerous.</p>

<p>Belgian Envoy Hosts Press Corps</p>
<h3>Fan Dewei Elaborates on His Impressions of Traveling in China</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Today, the Belgian envoy, Hua Luosi, hosted Chinese and foreign journalists to introduce Fan Dewei, with 33 people attending. Fan said that this trip to China was full of endless surprises because what he saw in writing was very different from what he witnessed in person.

He has been to Russia three times, the first time during the imperial era, the second time during the revolutionary era, and the third time this year.

He read Sun Yat-sen's English "Three Principles of the People" in Europe, and later read the French translation, and admired Mr. Sun's far-sightedness and the practical feasibility of his ideology. Rather than simply taking the European and American systems and applying them rigidly to China, he integrated them with Chinese history and customs, which can also serve as a lesson for European industrial societies. He made an agreement with Mr. Chu Minyi in Belgium to come to China to lecture on the issue of permanent international peace guarantees, to reciprocate the visits of Chinese scholars to Belgium and the friendship of Chinese students towards Belgium. Now, thanks to the hospitality of Ambassador Hua Luosi and the gathering with you all, I am grateful for your visit and thank Mr. Hua for his kindness. Later, Mr. Yu of the China United News Agency asked Mr. Fan, after seeing Wang Jingwei yesterday, what his political observations were on Mr. Wang's future.

<h3>Situation in Argentina Trending Toward Relaxation</h3>
<p>Cancellation of Excessive Military and Police Precautions</p>
<p>Presidential Envoy to Turkey Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 3rd. The President of Argentina today issued an order instructing Congress to hold its regular session starting September 11th and canceling excessive military and police precautions against coups. The situation now appears more relaxed than before.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 3rd. According to today's news, President Irigoyen is indeed facing fierce opposition from various party leaders, and it is expected that the cabinet will be forced to resign. Although strict procedures have been put in place to prevent turmoil, the situation in the capital is extremely tense. While disturbances may not occur, a coup is unavoidable.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 3rd. The Argentine embassy here declined to comment on the true situation in Buenos Aires. Most of the information received from various sources is contradictory. Recent reports claim that President Irigoyen has no intention of resigning and is only suffering from a slight illness. The Army Chief of Staff has indeed resigned, and the cabinet is also on the verge of collapse. Another report states that Argentine students have issued a declaration calling on the people to resist any attempts to establish a dictatorship, and the entire city is in a state of panic, as if disaster is imminent.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Istanbul, 3rd. The Argentine Consul General to Turkey and government representative, Biritu, committed suicide today, likely because the Argentine naval training ship Sarmiento sailed away shortly after a brief visit to Turkey. Biritu, living alone abroad, felt emotional. This led to thoughts of ending his life. In addition, the political situation in Argentina may also be related to his suicide. Argentine-Turkish business and diplomatic relations are minimal. Biritu is the only Argentine resident in Turkey, with no staff or merchants.</p>
<p>Japanese Privy Council Scrutiny Committee</p>
<h3>Situation Gradually Tense</h3>
<p>Central Question of Supreme Command</p>
<p>Opinions Divided</p>
<p>Government Shows Signs of Instability</p>
<p>Deliberating on Measures to Break the Impasse</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 4th. The 7th Privy Council Scrutiny Committee is scheduled to reconvene at 1 PM on the 5th. At yesterday's 6th scrutiny committee meeting, opinions were sharply divided between the government and the scrutiny committee on whether Naval Chief of Staff Kato's revision proposal was approved. Each side stubbornly held its ground. In fact, the meeting had run aground. Although the committee will reconvene tomorrow, it is difficult to expect progress. Some even reported that the meeting would be suspended. As the situation is so precarious, if a method to break the impasse is not devised, the cabinet crisis will become increasingly pressing. At this time, the Privy Council will likely take one of two approaches: either approve the treaty with a supplementary resolution, claiming that the procedures at the time of signing the treaty were indeed defective, or decisively refuse ratification, claiming that the procedural defects have a direct and significant impact on the naval force and cannot be regarded as merely formal defects. The government believes that even if the treaty is passed with a supplementary resolution, it will still have to consider the content of the resolution and the possible resignation of the cabinet. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the government is gathering all available advisors to find a way out of this difficult situation.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 4th. The Privy Council scrutiny committee has reached a standstill due to the conflict with the government over the question of whether the Naval Chief of Staff's opinion is approved. As the cabinet shows signs of instability, the government is currently considering countermeasures to break the deadlock with the Privy Council, including: (1) temporarily suspending the treaty review to jointly study how to bring the two sides' opinions closer; (2) if the opinions on whether to approve are not consistent, the review report should clearly record this and add the Privy Council's views, and submit it to the Emperor; (3) postponing the review of the issue of supreme command and reviewing other items first. However, all of these solutions are premised on the government's interests and would result in the Privy Council yielding. It is doubtful whether Chairman Ito is willing to comply. General observations are that the political situation will not develop as quickly as the government expects and will become more serious. The developments in the next few days are worth noting.</p>
<h3>Uprisings in Annam</h3>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 3rd. The French Ministry of War has confirmed reports of numerous French casualties in Morocco. Rebel tribes ambushed the French army in the Tafila highlands, causing the indigenous rifle team and foreign cavalry to fall into their trap.

<h3>Soviet Union Discovers Conspiracy to Overthrow Government</h3>
<p>Extensive Communication with White Russians Abroad</p>

<p>Reuters, Riga, 3rd.

The Central Committee pointed to the rich peasants and other counter-revolutionary saboteurs as those responsible for creating this situation.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Refuses Arbitration in Lena Goldfields Case</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 3rd.

<h3>French Aviators Successful</h3>
<p>French Cities Celebrate with Flags</p>
<p>Significant Private Bonuses</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 3rd. All of France rejoiced upon hearing the news that Costes and Bellonte had safely arrived in New York. All provinces and Paris flew the national flag, and the town of Vevey fired seventeen cannons in celebration. Captain Costes has been promoted to Major, and Bellonte has also been awarded a military rank.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 3rd. The total value of the awards that Costes and Bellonte have received from various newspapers and individuals for their direct flight from Paris to New York is approximately £500,000.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 3rd. Today, souvenir hunters tore off a piece of the wing of Costes's plane as a memento, causing concern that the French aviators would damage it and be unable to fly to Dallas, Texas, to claim the $25,000 prize offered by millionaire Eastwood. It was also reported that the Question Mark aircraft has been proven not to have suffered significant damage, and Costes will be able to fly to Dallas and receive the $25,000 prize. President Hoover is scheduled to host a luncheon for the French aviators on Monday. It is reported that Costes's friend, Costard, plans to fly the Question Mark back to Paris after Costes finishes flying in the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th. Costes and Bellonte flew to Dallas today.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Miami, 3rd. According to today's assessment by climatologists, the hurricane in Santo Domingo is currently moving northwest, and it is difficult to say definitively whether Cuba or the United States will be in its path.</p>

<h3>Details of the Discovery of André's Remains</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd. The official report of the Swedish government committee sent to recover the remains of the André expedition was released today. The content differs significantly from outside reports. It is claimed that only the remains of André and Strindberg were found. Frankel died midway while walking from the balloon landing site to White Island. The remains of André and Strindberg showed signs of extreme trampling. However, two diaries were found in their pockets, carefully wrapped in oilcloth and wool cloth, so the writing is still clear. One notebook only recorded a few observations, while the other contains detailed notes about the journey from the balloon landing site to White Island. It was found that the two reached White Island on September 9th, nearly two months after leaving Danes Island by balloon on July 11, 1897.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices, Qingdao, Hu Ruoyu: I have received an order from the National Government appointing Hu Ruoyu as the Mayor of Qingdao Municipality. Upon receipt of this order, I, Hu Ruoyu, solemnly consider that Qingdao is an important port in eastern Shandong, a place of mixed foreign residents and converging commercial vessels. Only eight years have passed since its recovery, and only two years since its reorganization into a municipality. There are many beginnings, both to promote and to reform, and measures, both internal and external, are not easy. Such a great burden is entrusted to limited talents, and in these difficult times, I feel deeply anxious. I dare not express my worries and anxieties. However, as I have received earnest encouragement from all parties and countless urgings from colleagues, I can only exert my humble efforts to live up to the hopes of the entire district. How dare I seek ease and comfort and cherish my own private concerns? Therefore, on the 4th of this month, I respectfully took office. From now on, regarding all municipal administration, I will sincerely plan and act in accordance with the Party's principles, sharing its preferences and aversions. When appropriate, I will adhere to past regulations; when innovation is needed, I will not be bound by outdated practices. I hope that both Chinese and foreign residents can live in harmony and the community can be secure. I hope that all industries can prosper and the will of the people can be expressed. I have set this as my guiding principle to guide my actions, and I will not shirk from any labor or complaint, nor will I be concerned with praise or blame. I earnestly request that all contemporary pioneers and prominent figures from all sides provide timely instruction so that I may follow it. In this way, I, Ruoyu, can slightly reduce my worries, and the entire municipality will be grateful for the guidance. I offer this humble message and hope for your understanding. Hu Ruoyu.</p>

<h3>107th Meeting of the Central Standing Committee</h3>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Hosts Press Conference</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department hosted a press conference at 2 PM on the 4th, attended by over twenty reporters from various newspapers. Liu Luyin chaired the meeting and reported the following: "After the recovery of Jinan, Yan's elite forces have been completely wiped out. The various reactionary factions in the north are now plotting independently. Feng's troops on the Pinghan and Longhai Railways have also withdrawn and are lingering between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Wang Jingwei, realizing the military failures, is still vigorously advocating the formation of a puppet government to create a false impression, hoping to recruit one or two generals from Yan and Feng's defeated troops to sow the seeds of their evil influence. However, the people in the north are impoverished and the resources are exhausted. If Yan and Feng's main forces are destroyed, the people will rise up to support the Central Government to alleviate their suffering. Peace and unification are now a universal demand in China. However, warlords and communists are exploiting the suffering of the people as tools for political struggle. The communists use the slogan of supporting the interests of the people, but they lead the people to their deaths. This is a major crisis in China. The people should be completely awakened so that the campaign to suppress the rebellion can end as soon as possible, and the communists who act as tools for the Third International can be eliminated. Only then will the Chinese people have a chance to survive. Recently, the military progress on the front lines has been very rapid, and the people in various regions are eager for the Central Army to arrive soon to save them from their misery. Therefore, the future is very optimistic." The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3>Orders for General Offensive Against Communist Troops in Hunan</h3>
<p>Hankow dispatch: Since the Fourth Route Army gathered in Changsha, He Jian also hurried back to Changsha from the front. Besides constructing fortifications on one hand, he also telegraphed the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters to send reinforcements. The newly organized Fifth Division under Gong Bingfan, the Twenty-second Division under Luo Lin, the Third Training Division under Qian Dajun, and the newly organized Third Division under Li Yunlong, all dispatched by the Pacification Headquarters, have successively arrived in Changsha. Six airplanes are also circling over Changsha. He Jian, with his strong military force, decided to order a general offensive within days. On the 1st and 2nd, there were only minor skirmishes. On the Hunanese army side, He Jian ordered all divisions to cooperate with the central divisions, deploying forces at key strategic locations near Changsha, and assigning other units to outflank the communist bandits on the left and right wings and rear. By the evening of the 2nd, all preparations were complete. On the morning of the 3rd, He Jian issued the general offensive order, mobilizing the entire front, and ordering that any army unit retreating would be executed by firing squad. The communists, upon hearing of the large-scale offensive, were greatly alarmed. However, because the Jiangxi provincial troops had already followed and pursued them into Hunan, retreat was difficult. Therefore, they had no choice but to resist desperately. According to He Jian's telegram to Hankow, he reported that over a thousand bandits were killed on the first day of the offensive. He would continue the attack on the second day and was determined to defeat the main force of the bandits within three days, recapture Liuyang within five days, recapture Pingjiang within seven days, and completely eliminate the remaining bandits within ten days.

<h3>Northeast's Attitude Towards the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports a Shenyang dispatch of the 2nd stating that Zhang Xueliang's attitude towards the organization of a new government in the north is not as sympathetic as external rumors suggest. The claim by the Jin representative that Zhang welcomed this move and had agreed to all plans does not correspond with the facts. Zhang Xueliang informed them that the organization of a new government was purely the affair of the Jin faction. As an official collaborating with the Nanjing government, he could not support such actions. As for the seven-point program announced by the Enlarged Conference, while admirable in principle, empty words are of no use. Zhang also stated, "My sincere wish is not to see China divided. I am strongly opposed to civil war and hope for the early restoration of peace throughout the country." It is expected that Liaoning's attitude towards the overall situation will be decided at the upcoming leaders' meeting within days.</p>
<h3>Military Cadets Studying in Japan to Depart</h3>
<p>The National Government has selected ten outstanding senior military officers from various military institutions to study at the Japanese Army University. Previously, the General Staff and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had officially requested the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army General Staff to notify the Japanese Army University to accept them according to established precedents. It is now reported that the Japanese military attaché in Nanjing, Mr. Kita, has notified the selected cadets to report to Japan this month. These officers have already prepared their luggage and will soon depart. Their titles and names are as follows:</p>
<p>Brigade Commander of the Fifth Army　Zhou Hunyuan</p>
<p>Section Chief of the Military Affairs Department of the Ministry of Military Administration　Yang Jue</p>
<p>Staff Officer of the General Staff Department　Yang Bingli</p>
<p>Staff Officer of the General Headquarters　Ruan Yongqi</p>
<p>Supervisor of the Training Inspectorate　He Shaozhou</p>
<p>Section Chief of the Ministry of Military Administration　Yu Yuqiong</p>
<p>Section Chief of the General Staff Department　Gong Liming</p>
<p>In addition, there are three others, including Tan Fulie, who are already studying at Japanese vocational schools or auditing courses at the Army University in advance.</p>
<h3>Hu Ruoyu Discusses Governance Policies for Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: The newly appointed Mayor of Qingdao, Hu Ruoyu, arrived in Qingdao on the morning of the 1st. After resting at the mayor's official residence, he moved into the International Sanitarium. I visited him at half past two in the afternoon. He was napping, so I waited in the reception room, where several others were already waiting. At three o'clock, Hu came out to meet us, wearing a white Zhongshan suit, very plainly dressed. After the greetings, I asked, "How long was your journey here, Mayor?" Hu replied, "I left Beidaihe at noon on the 30th of last month and arrived in Qingdao at ten o'clock this morning, so it was only forty-eight hours on the way." I asked, "When will you take office?" He answered, "Mayor Ge has already left Qingdao, and the municipal government cannot be without someone in charge. I intended to take office today, but Mr. Cai (Yuanpei) has not returned from his visit to Laoshan, and there are still matters to discuss with him. Therefore, I have set the 4th as the day to take over and have invited Mr. Cai to represent the supervisor of the oath nearby." I asked, "What are your policies after taking office?" He replied, "I am not very familiar with the situation in Qingdao. Future policies will require me to observe the local circumstances to formulate specific plans. However, my mission here is to work, not just to be an official. In my opinion, Qingdao, being a place of international attention, should have minimal contact with political affairs and focus on developing industry and commerce, making it a commercialized city. Qingdao is the only commercial port in North China with numerous factories. If we expand upon its existing advantages, the development of industry and commerce would be limitless. To develop commerce, we must first ensure that capitalists are willing to invest. Therefore, maintaining public order is of utmost importance. After taking office, I will do everything in my power to maintain the city's security, so that it is not affected by the domestic turmoil, and the citizens can live and work in peace. Capitalists will naturally come to Qingdao upon hearing of this, and the commercial situation is expected to improve. Furthermore, education in this city is very backward, with too many out-of-school children. Those residing in Qingdao often have no choice but to move elsewhere because their children have no place to study, which is a negative phenomenon. In the future, we must strive to develop education to make it a cultural center. In addition, for municipal administration, we must undertake projects that benefit the citizens and eliminate what the citizens detest. I hope the press will provide guidance at any time." I asked, "Is it true, as reported, that Zhang Xueming will be the commander of the Qingdao garrison?" He replied, "This is a rumor fabricated by a Japanese newspaper; there is absolutely no such thing." I asked, "Where are Mr. Li Shizeng and Commander Shen now?" He answered, "Mr. Li is in Beidaihe, and Commander Shen returned to Shenyang with Commander Zhang on the morning of the 30th to inspect the Jiang defenses and then return to Qingdao." I asked, "What is Commander Zhang's attitude towards the current situation?" He replied, "Commander Zhang has always advocated peaceful reunification." At this point, due to the presence of other guests, I took my leave. (September 1st)</p>
<h3>The Scourge of War in Chenliu and Tongxu</h3>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: A friend who returned from the war zone, passing through Chenliu and Tongxu, witnessed the devastation of the war. According to him, Chenliu, located at a crossroads, is the gateway to eastern Henan. As the rear of the war, it has suffered from years of bandits, floods, droughts, and famines. This year, the massive concentration of troops for several months has caused even greater losses. According to locals, they were required to supply 1,230 carts, 2,400 cattle and horses, and were assessed seven times, totaling over 122,500 yuan in silver. The cost of wheat was over 82,700 yuan in silver, and the combined cost of firewood and fodder was over 120,700 yuan in silver. The loss from unofficial requisitions is estimated to be over 80,000 yuan, with over 2,000 people fleeing and 3,102 laborers conscripted. This year's wheat harvest averaged less than 30%, all of which was used for supplies. With prolonged drought and no hope for the autumn harvest, the survivors of the calamity are crying out in anguish. Furthermore, Tongxu County, bordering the front line, although not a formal war zone, has suffered enormous losses from the continuous passage of large armies over the past few months. According to the people of the county, they were required to supply 1,955 carts, 8,101 cattle and horses, with property losses amounting to 520,430 yuan. There were five assessments totaling over 57,824 yuan in silver. Grain and food cost over 126,902 yuan in silver, and firewood cost over 31,330 yuan in silver. There were 3,597 laborers conscripted. This year's wheat harvest averaged about 30%, but the supply losses were so immense. With drought followed by floods, there is little hope for the autumn harvest. The means of survival are exhausted, and cries for help are endless. The Henan Relief Committee has telegraphed the military authorities and various benevolent organizations in the north and south about the disaster situation in Chenliu and Tongxu, requesting assistance and relief.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Tobacco Guild Requests Amendment to Sino-Egyptian Treaty</h3>
<p>Special Clause Affects Exports of Domestic Goods Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Tobacco Guild states that the Sino-Egyptian Treaty was originally intended to be based on the principle of mutual benefit. However, a special clause added to the treaty hinders the export of Guangdong tobacco to Egypt, causing losses to agriculture, industry, and commerce. They have petitioned the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce to forward their request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government for a prompt amendment or extension of the implementation period of the special clause to protect national rights. The original text states, "The Egyptian government has signed treaties with China, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, and other countries, all based on the principle of mutual benefit, and promulgated the provisions. However, for China, the provisions state that 'If either party wishes to cancel this temporary agreement during its term, it must notify the other party three months in advance.' Underneath this, it adds the clause: 'However, on February 16, 1931, this agreement must be rendered invalid according to the Egyptian Customs Law No. 2 promulgated in 1930.' Reading this translation is deeply shocking. The main Chinese goods exported to Egypt are natural products, such as tobacco produced in Guangdong Province, with very large sales volumes. However, the process from planting tobacco to shipping it takes six to seven months to complete. If the term of the current treaty is limited, the tobacco prepared for export to Egypt will inevitably not be shipped in time. This would cause enormous losses to agriculture, industry, and commerce. If the deadline is exceeded, the customs law will treat it as if it were from a non-treaty country, and taxes will be doubled. In the future, the export of domestic goods will be severely affected. Moreover, countries such as the United States, Switzerland, Denmark, and Belgium do not have this clause, and it is specifically applied to China. This makes the treaty equivalent to no treaty, which is particularly embarrassing in terms of national dignity. Therefore, we jointly submit this petition to your chamber, respectfully requesting that you consider it, forward it to the Construction Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, and urge them to amend the special clause added to the Sino-Egyptian Treaty or extend the implementation period in advance to protect commerce and national integrity." The General Chamber of Commerce, upon learning of the situation, deemed it related to foreign treaties and has forwarded the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Cleans Up the Guangzhou Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank</h3>
<p>The Court Organizes a Liquidation Committee</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: After the provincial government decided to allocate the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank to the High Court to organize a liquidation committee, the High Court immediately dispatched a chief clerk of the court, together with the president of the District Court, a chief prosecutor of the District Court, two prosecutors, a chief clerk, and two presiding judges. It also appointed the dean of the Faculty of Law of Zhongshan University and the director of the Central Bank, totaling ten people, to establish a committee to liquidate the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank on the 25th. Yao Lixiu, the dean of the Faculty of Law of Zhongshan University, was publicly elected as the chairman of the committee. They have already started to work and have sent letters to the General Chamber of Commerce and creditors to each send a representative to attend the meetings. Yesterday, they, together with the representative of the Public Security Bureau, Mr. Ling, and Mr. Liang of the Taiping Police Sub-station, went to the bank to receive all documents and books. The representative of the Public Security Bureau handed over one bundle of documents and sixteen keys that he had been holding. The general manager of the bank, Chen Guoxuan, and the deputy general manager, Ouyang Qi, handed over the bank's cash, books, furniture, and other items, which were all received one by one. The committee has reported the inventory to the provincial government for review. It is reported that the committee is conducting various matters separately and has announced that the period from September 1st to 30th is the deadline for reporting claims, requiring all creditors to report their names and the amount of debt within the prescribed period. According to the committee's recent investigation, the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank owes approximately 500,000 yuan, and the amount of loans issued is approximately 170,000 yuan. Over 50,000 yuan of loans have been recovered in recent days and temporarily stored in the Central Bank for distribution after the liquidation is completed. According to the committee, the liquidation will take at least two months because it will take time to recover loans and auction off assets. As for the amount to be repaid to creditors, the estimated amount is at least 30%. (August 30th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Rectifies Long-Standing Abuses in Taxation</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government considers that the province's military and administrative expenses are vast, but the collection of regular and miscellaneous taxes by various counties is often ineffective, with delayed remittances and unauthorized misappropriation of tax funds, resulting in unclear accounts. These various long-standing abuses affect revenue and cause the provincial treasury to be frequently depleted. In order to rectify this situation, in addition to dispatching eight people from the Finance Department, including Wang Xianjie, Zhou Xinyuan, Yao Chongjiang, Yi Yang, Xiu Yanyan, Deng Shiqiao, Qiu Zhenglun, and Chen Mianyun, to various counties to investigate and supervise collection, it has also formulated measures to rectify the collection and remittance of taxes by various counties, ordering all county governments and finance bureaus to strictly comply. The measures are as follows: (1) Special regulations are established for the collection of land tax, deed tax, tooth tax, pawnbroker tax, and slaughter tax in each county. It is essential to collect the full amount within the prescribed time limit. If there is a shortfall due to delays, the Finance Department will assess and list the responsible officials for severe punishment according to regulations. (2) Tax revenues should be remitted promptly, and it is forbidden to withhold or deposit them. The amount of taxes collected in the first month should be remitted immediately once a certain amount is accumulated. The remaining amount should be remitted to the treasury before the 5th of the second month. Any delays will be dealt with severely by the Finance Department according to the regulations on delayed remittance of land tax by counties. (3) Counties often misappropriate funds earmarked for the province without approval, and then use other uses as excuses after being urged, hindering provincial revenue. This is unacceptable. In the future, the provincial funds should not be misappropriated without prior approval. Violations will be treated as embezzlement of public funds, and the perpetrators will be held responsible for compensation. For funds that have already been misappropriated, they must be repaid in full within one month. Any delays will be investigated by the Finance Department and reported for punishment. (4) Counties should pay the allocated funds upon receiving notification and immediately submit a general receipt to the treasury. Delays are not allowed. Violations will be investigated and punished by the Finance Department. (5) Whenever a collecting official in a county is replaced, the collected funds should be cleared on the date of handover, and all funds due to the province should be fully remitted. If, at the time of accounting, it is found that 1,000 yuan or more of the funds to be remitted has been withheld, the Finance Department will investigate and report for severe punishment. If they are transferred to another county, they must not go to the assigned post before remitting the funds due to the province in full. The Finance Department should investigate and report such cases to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs for immediate detention. (6) Counties should submit the land tax monthly report and various monthly report forms before the 5th of the following month. However, counties often delay and hold them back for months, which is a violation. In the future, the regulations must be strictly followed, and the reports must be submitted on time for assessment. Failure to submit them for a long time will be investigated by the Finance Department and reported for punishment.</p>
<h3>Local Communications Songjiang</h3>
<p>Hu's Murder of Wife Case Exposed Hu Yinglong, from Taiwu Bridge, is thirty years old and has inherited three households. He married Zhang from the city three years ago. There was no affection between them, and they had no children. Hu's widowed aunt, Nie, always favored Hu Yinglong and treated the daughter-in-law coldly. It is easy to imagine the family's situation. However, on the evening of the 30th of last month, Zhang suddenly died violently. On the morning of the 31st, her maternal family arrived and heard rumors from neighbors. They became suspicious of the death, leading to a suspicious case. Yesterday, Zhang Zeshen and Zhang Zeyu, the younger brothers of the deceased, hired lawyer Wang Tinggan to write a petition asking the prosecutor's office to investigate thoroughly. The gist of the petition was that the deceased was envied by her mother-in-law, Nie, from the night of her wedding to Hu Yinglong, and the couple and the mother-in-law were constantly at odds. There were deep rope marks on the deceased's neck, which were now blue-purple, and knife wounds. Her limbs were bent, and both wrists were blue-purple and swollen, indicating that they were forcibly held by an accomplice. It was obviously a murder. At the time of the interaction, the Hu family separated my mother and us and persuaded us to stop, so we could not discuss the matter and report it, and the coffin was hastily prepared. When the coffin was carried out, the neighbors protested loudly, intending to redress the grievance of the deceased. When we returned to hold a family meeting, everyone said that since there were obvious injuries, we should seek justice. Therefore, we asked lawyer Wang to file a complaint. Yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon, after receiving the petition, the prosecutor's office immediately arrested the defendant and conducted a preliminary hearing. Hu Yinglong's testimony was reportedly evasive. Then, the plaintiff was questioned as to why he did not report it before the encoffining. According to the testimony, when we heard the news and went to see, we felt suspicious, but we were persuaded by the Hu family clan leader Runzhang and his brothers, and other female Hu relatives, to stop my mother, so we could not meet and discuss the report. It was ordered that the coffin be opened for examination today. The burial site is at the Data Bang in Shishi Yitu outside the North Gate. The prosecutor, accompanied by the clerk, examiners, and doctors Ke Haiqiong and Zhang Shaoxiu, went to examine the body. Hu Yinglong was also taken by the police. At the time of this reporter's writing, the examination had just been completed and returned to the court. For a while, the onlookers were blocked, inquiring about the examination results. Although no official announcement has been made, it is reported that there were three fingerprints on the neck. Hu Yinglong initially denied it, but when his fingers matched, he admitted that he was temporarily confused.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robbery of Commercial Ship, Five Robbers Arrested The Xicheng line of Licheng Shipping Company's Wuxi-Cheng boat, under the Gongyun Bridge in Xiyi, departed from Cheng at around 10 o'clock the night before last. When it arrived under the railway bridge near Gaoqiao, seven or eight robbers with guns shouted to stop the ship and fired warning shots. The driver, seeing this, stopped and docked the ship. Just as the robbers were about to board the ship to rob it, more than ten armed soldiers suddenly rushed over. It turned out that a squad of military police was stationed under the Gaoqiao Bridge and came after hearing the gunshots. The soldiers rushed to the railway bridge and saw that it was a robbery of a ship. They immediately went forward to arrest them and caught five robbers on the spot: Shi Jincai, Yang Shouchong, Xia Peifu, Chen Er, and Zhang Yaer. Five fake pistols and a string of small firecrackers were found on their bodies. They were immediately presented to the regiment headquarters for interrogation.

After Tang withdrew the money, he went to the company to pack his clothes and falsely claimed to Chen Zikun, the manager, that he needed three days of leave. He then absconded with Sanbao. Chen Zikun learned of this yesterday and immediately sent an express letter to Junyuan's father in Hankou and sent people to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places to search for him.</p>
<p>Robbery Victim Shoots and Kills Bandit Leader In Yanjia Dang, District 16 (Wan'an City), of this county, there are more than 30 households. Yan Liqing is the deputy township head and comes from a wealthy family. At about 2:00 a.m. the night before last, three or four boats suddenly arrived in the village, carrying more than 20 bandits with seven or eight guns. They rushed ashore and first went to the home of Yan Asheng. They tied up Yan's hands and asked where Yan Liqing's house was. Yan Asheng replied that it was over a few houses. The bandits left him and rushed to Yan Liqing's house. When they found the door closed, they had difficulty breaking it down. A bandit leader climbed over the wall and onto the roof, intending to open the door from inside. At this time, Yan Wenyuan, the son of Liqing, was awakened from the wheat and immediately took his self-defense rifle and went out. He saw a bandit on the roof and immediately fired, hitting the bandit in the head. The bandit immediately fell to the roof and died. The other bandits were terrified when they heard the gunshot from the victim's family and left in a hurry. Yesterday, the county government sent an investigator to the village to investigate.</p>

Both had served as directors of the Municipal Administration Bureau and were currently members of the Chamber of Commerce and assistants in a district office. The Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department were furious at the rampant reactionary forces in Jiangyin and immediately sent a committee to conduct an interrogation. They returned to the province the day before yesterday (the 3rd) to report. Yesterday, County Magistrate Li received telegrams from both the Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that the communist Chen Wei Wu had repeatedly participated in riots and that his confession was confirmed. He should be sentenced to death. The bandit Yu Bing Qing, nicknamed Big Head Ah Bing, had repeatedly committed arson and murder, confessed without denial, and should also be sentenced to death. After receiving the telegrams, County Magistrate Li ordered the police team to bring Chen and Yu to the barren land behind Zhongshan Park at Jin Gang Tui around 3 PM and execute them by firing squad. It was raining heavily at the time, and the onlookers were as numerous as a wall. Chen's body was collected by his mother, Chen Ji Shi. Chen had been working in the education sector for many years and lived in the Qianjie neighborhood of the county, and was 27 years old.</p>

<p>Smugglers Attack Smuggling Suppression Team. The Taojia Peng area of Dinghai County has been stationed by the fourth team of the Smuggling Suppression Team. Unexpectedly, at around 1 PM on the afternoon of last month (July) 30th, over thirty smugglers rushed into the team's office, intending to seize weapons. Fortunately, the team leader, Zhao Cheng, had taken precautions and immediately dispersed the smugglers. However, the smugglers were unwilling to submit and gathered fifty to sixty people to fight again an hour later. Both sides opened fire. The officers and soldiers were outnumbered and were killed Huang Dafu, one soldier, and over ten were seriously injured. Afterwards, Team Leader Zhao led his troops to bravely resist and finally repelled the smugglers, capturing four ringleaders: Zhang Pingnan, Wang Qiaoxian, Ni Ajin, and Liu Sifu. Due to the seriousness of the case, the captured criminals were sent to the provincial capital for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Bandit Suppression Headquarters Expands. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters of Ning Shao Wen Tai in Zhejiang Province has been designated as the second district by the provincial government. Commander Gan still governs Ning Shao Wen Tai. Now, with the frequent banditry in eastern Zhejiang, a plan is being devised to thoroughly eradicate it. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters should be expanded. In addition to Wang Wenhan continuing to serve as the commanding officer, Gan Qingchi, the commander of the 4th Security Regiment, and Liu Xiwun, the commander of the 1st Regiment, were appointed as deputy commanders yesterday, so that command can be implemented thoroughly and support can be provided to each other.</p>

<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>Letter from Lawyer Wang Youlin</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: According to my client, Yu Pingsheng, the manager of the Changshu Da Bao newspaper, he has claimed that the Suzhou correspondence in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month (The reactionary case in the Changshu press opens) contains inaccuracies. The Da Bao was previously sealed because it published articles from the Yangguang Society, but it has been approved by the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party to resume publication. Gui Han is not an employee of the Da Bao, and Shen Xuexia was only a part-time reporter for the Da Bao. Gui and Shen were detained entirely due to the Yangguang Society case and have no connection to the Da Bao. He has entrusted me to send a letter of correction. I hope you will publish it as a favor.

<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Report on the Participation of the National Private Electric Power Association in the World Power Conference, by Li Yanshi and Shen Sifang</h3>
<p>Yanshi, Sifang, and others, as representatives of this association, attended the Second World Power Conference in Berlin, Germany. We departed at the end of April and passed through Little Luzon and Singapore, where we received warm hospitality from Consuls Li and Tang. We took the opportunity to investigate the state of the electric power industry in both locations. On the ship, we also met with Consul Shen of Medan, who agreed to investigate the electric power situation in the Dutch East Indies archipelago on our behalf. We arrived in Genoa, Italy in early June. We stayed there for a day and, with the introduction of our acting consul, visited an electric factory. Then we went to Switzerland to meet Fei Fushou, an engineer from the Suzhou Electric Factory. Mr. Fei was one of the representatives sent by this association to attend the Power Conference in Berlin. We stayed in Switzerland for a day and then went to the Berlin Power Conference office. They had been informed of our arrival in Germany in advance and sent a special staff to greet us at the station. Newspaper reporters came to inquire about the news. We were determined to conduct on-the-spot investigations and did not want to overdo the publicity, so we dealt with them briefly. Government representatives Huang Boqiao and Wang Shengsan had arrived in Germany in advance, and Zhu Maocheng and Wu Keyu also arrived successively. Representatives of our association, Yao Kewen from the Jiujiang Electric Company and Zhou Maobai from the Hanyang Electric Company, also came to the meeting. Ambassador Jiang to Germany gave a special welcome banquet. At the same time, the German Eastern Association, various industrial groups, and various companies that had dealings with our country in the past competed to host banquets. It was difficult to attend so many events. At the same time, Ambassador Jiang, in view of the small number of representatives from our country, appointed more than ten students studying abroad to assist in everything and to attend the conference as observers in order to enhance our prestige. Thus, a delegation was formed and a communications office was established. Before the opening of the conference, the delegation held a meeting to exchange views. We were fortunate that the sentiments and views of the representatives were harmonious and consistent with the goals of our association. The Power Conference was initiated by the Englishman Dunlop. Its purpose was to create an international organization to discuss and study various important issues of power economics. In 1924, the founding conference was held in England. Representatives of electric factories from various countries, as well as scientists, technicians, and economists, all attended the meeting. They conducted a general study of the sources of power and its development in industry, transportation, and economy. Afterwards, a partial meeting was held once a year to discuss matters such as hydropower generation, the regulation of electricity, and fuel issues, rotating in various countries. Last year, a partial meeting of the Power Conference was held at the same time as the Japan International Industrial Conference. This conference, in addition to concluding the affairs of previous partial meetings, further explored the entire power issue, paying particular attention to the distribution of power and the economic issues of using power. Therefore, economic principles were the major premise of this meeting. We, having understood the purpose of the Power Conference, attended the group meetings after the opening. From June 16th to 26th, the discussions were divided into 18 categories: (1) The use of electricity, (2) The manufacture and application of gas, (3) The use and transmission of power, (4) Thermal power plants, (5) Prime movers, (6) The economics of solid fuels, (7) Boilers, (8) Internal combustion engines, (9) Hydropower plants and their economic equipment, (10) The development and regulation of incoming power, (11) Storage and regulation of electricity, (12) Generators, (13) Distribution equipment, (14) The transmission of electricity, (15) Economic load ratio and electricity prices of power plants, (16) The supply and regulation of power, (17) Power in transportation, (18) Research on standard statistics education. There were 3,900 representatives from 34 countries, which was a grand event of the time. A total of 392 papers were presented, and the essence was extracted to form 34 general reports, which were presented, read, and discussed one by one. This kind of report, regarding the recent state of various aspects of world power issues, gave us a deep understanding, which was indeed rare. Especially in our country, where agriculture is declining and industry is nascent, national power, animal power, and human power account for a large part. How should we use natural resources, coal, oil, and hydropower, to generate power to meet all needs? Which should come first, which should come later, which is economical and effective, which is futile and ineffective, which should be promoted by the state, and which should be operated by the people? Furthermore, in view of the fact that electricity is the most economical and convenient power source, and that electricity accounts for a large part of the statistics of the world's power development, if we want to develop our country's agriculture and industry, if we want to build China, in other words, if we want to save China, it will not be possible without developing the electrical industry. This association is the only major gathering of the national electrical industry. Its future work is complex and extensive. The mission it shoulders is heavy and significant. Its relationship with the Power Conference is deep and significant. We are talented but inexperienced. We have accepted the responsibility of being representatives. We only have to humbly lower our hearts, not hold preconceived notions, and discuss with representatives from advanced countries. We will collect works. It is a very long story, and we will wait until another day to write a special book for the reference of colleagues across the country. Now we would like to report the general results of the Second Power Conference as follows: (1) There were more than 3,000 experts attending the conference. Because of the cutting, grinding, and viewing, emotions were generated, and international goodwill was also improved. (2) Use technical methods to reduce the cost of electricity, improve the load situation, and promote the cooperation of the electric power industry. As a result, the people can enjoy the benefits of cheap electricity. (3) The supply of power is more complete, and the methods of making goods from raw materials are also increasing. Each new method requires the employment of a new job. The increase in these new jobs can offset the number of people reduced by machines and more. Therefore, the more natural power is used, the fewer unemployed workers there will be. (4) After the European War, due to changes in technical and economic conditions, the issue of whether the electrical industry should be run commercially or officially also arose. Politicians have recognized that the electrical industry must be managed by the government. Economists mostly hold the opposite view and advocate commercial operation. This conference also discussed this issue in depth. As a result, the majority still supports commercial operation. At a minimum, only a small number of joint ventures between the government and businesses are considered feasible. After the Power Conference closed, the Rhine River Group visited major German industries, such as brown coal mines, steel mills, paint factories, and motor manufacturing factories. After a period of more than a month, we can report the following: (To be continued)</p>
<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>The National Government's Resolution on the National Education and Culture Budget</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, stating that the national education and culture budget for the 19th year that should be compiled by the ministry has been compiled in accordance with regulations and sent to the Ministry of Finance for review on May 31st. The budget for the 19th year of national universities, national specialized schools, and the National Beiyang Institute of Technology has been changed compared with the approved budget for the 18th year due to factual necessity. The 19th year has already begun, and the schools are proceeding separately according to the planned construction plan, including adding classes and supplementing equipment, and have started preparations according to the 19th year budget standard. However, because the budget has not been approved, the school administration is extremely difficult. We have repeatedly requested that the budget be approved in advance. It is appropriate to request that your court review and approve and forward the budget for the 19th year of each school to the Central Political Conference in advance. It is heard that the government and court will handle the expenses of each school as before until the new budget is officially announced, and regarding the cultural budget, the National Government ordered the Executive Yuan to write a letter saying that the Central Political Conference had approved the letter from the Ministry of Finance approving the Ministry of Education's transmission of the budget for national education and culture for the 19th year and requested that it be reviewed and forwarded. The total expenditures listed in the second-level expenditure budget for education and culture for the 19th year compiled by the Ministry of Education, in addition to the Central Education Museum as a new business, and the year before last as a regular expense, a total of 13,712,055 yuan has been reviewed and approved by the Finance Committee one after another. The total expenditure for the current year is 17,140,645 yuan, an increase of 3,428,590 yuan compared with the approved total for the previous year. The recurring expenses of the Ministry of Education have also increased by 108,000 yuan. At a time when finances are difficult and national treasury expenditures are huge, it seems inappropriate to expand the budget for military and political expenses in the 19th year. Should this education and culture budget be appropriately reduced so that the financial education business of the country can be planned and taken care of? We will send the original budget for your review and so on. The case was handed over to the Finance Group for review, and the reply stated that the implementation details of the 19th year budget relief measures have been reviewed and deemed feasible. Please follow the procedure in the case of the national education and culture budget so as to be unified. Is it appropriate? Please make a public decision, etc. The conference decided to handle it according to the review opinions. The implementation details of the 19th year budget relief measures have been communicated in another document. It is appropriate to record the case and send the original printed letter from the Ministry of Finance for your reference and instruct the Ministry of Finance to comply with it, etc. Attached is a copy of the original letter.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Distributes the Primer-Marked Version of Sun Yat-sen's Testament</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has distributed a primer-marked version of Sun Yat-sen's testament to promote it widely, sending letters to all agencies inside and outside Beijing (inside Beijing refers to the central party and government agencies, and outside Beijing refers to the provincial and municipal governments). The letter stated that Sun Yat-sen's testament should be popularized as soon as possible, so that every household in the country knows about it. Now is the time to promote the primer-mark system, and we should use this system to help popularize the testament. We have now annotated the text of Sun Yat-sen's testament with primer-marks, character by character, to facilitate the learning and recitation of the general public and the promotion of various agencies. The printing has now been completed, and we are sending several copies. Please check and paste them in your agency and forward them to your subordinates for posting. If there are not enough, please imitate and print them to promote them widely. In addition, the four tones marked by this foreign sound are annotated according to the standard sounds set by the National Language Unification Preparation Committee of the Ministry of Education. If the four tones are not marked in local letters, please check it out.</p>

<h3>Anti-Drug Association Promotes Anti-Drug Education</h3>
<p>In order to promote student participation in the anti-drug movement and implement anti-drug education policies, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association will publish a monthly anti-drug magazine and various series of novels. The association will actively promote these publications to schools across the country to achieve widespread reach. In addition, the association will hold essay competitions and an anti-drug speech contest in Shanghai. The contest has already been held three times.

The Anti-Drug Association has begun preparations for this year's speech contest and is inviting prominent figures from the national government and enthusiastic individuals from home and abroad to donate prizes to encourage participation. It is expected that schools will soon be invited to join. Provincial and municipal branches have been notified by the association to follow suit. Furthermore, the association has repeatedly promoted the inclusion of anti-drug materials in textbooks. The association drafted a proposal that was discussed and approved for implementation at the First National Anti-Smoking Conference. However, many newly published textbooks do not include these materials. To promote the implementation of this plan, the association's education department has been tasked with collecting all historical information about the anti-drug movement and other drug-related events that can serve as teaching materials for textbooks. The association will compile this information and submit it separately to various publishing houses for inclusion in reprints or new compilations. It is reported that the association has also requested that government authorities include the date of the annual anti-drug week on calendars to indicate its permanence. The Ministry of Education has forwarded this request to the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica for processing. The Shanghai branch has also requested that the Social Bureau include the date in the new calendars it prints, and this has been approved. It is reported that the association also plans to promote the realization of this plan soon.</p>

<h3>A Record of Watching the Three Major Tennis Championships in Japan (Continued)</h3>
<p>Although Jiro Sato, the ever-victorious general of the students this year, won the final honor, he suffered a lot from the fifth week of the competition onwards. Especially in the semi-finals, Yamada, a new star from Keio, won two sets first. In the fourth set, the situation gradually improved, and it was suspected that Sato would definitely lose. Unexpectedly, the Far East hero boldly advanced and applied his skills in front of the net, saving the crisis with one breath. After tying the score, he encouraged the remaining courage and displayed his magical power, defeating Yamada with 6-0 and restoring his original face. Because Shimura was tired and weak in the final, he refused to fight, so the Far East representative Nui, who lost to Shimura with three straight defeats, was unexpectedly far away from the championship with a score of 3-1. In the doubles semi-finals, each represented the eastern and western schools, and there seemed to be an atmosphere of inter-regional competition in the invisible. The two were the first-ranked players of Keio and Waseda University, respectively, and they were also the Japanese Far East representatives. In the past two years, the two have met four times in school competitions or championship events, and the record is that the Yamagishi Shimura team (Keio) won three times and the Sato Kawachi team (Waseda) won once. Last year, the former ranked second in the All-Japan doubles rankings, and the latter ranked third. However, since this year, the results seem to have been surpassed. The Waseda team won 3-2 in both the school competition and the Takarazuka Invitational Tournament, while the Keio team avenged their humiliation with 3-0 in the Kanto Championship. In total, the Keio team still leads with four wins and three losses, so this final is no less than a death match for the honor of ranking. This is because, apart from the autumn school competition, there are only the All-Japan and Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun competitions left, so it is. As a result of the battle, the Sato Kawachi team won the championship with 3-2, and at the same time, they equalized the past record. Many people who are honest said that the Yamagishi Shimura team is gradually declining this year, while the Waseda team is both good at singles and their cooperation has reached perfection. At the All-Japan Championships, in addition to the Ota Abe two-player cup, the voice of singing hegemony is very high, and they should be watched with admiration.</p>
<p>The members of the Meiji University tennis team, Aikawa Fujikura, who went on an expedition to Shanghai in the past, had already entered the elimination list in the third week of singles. The two paired up in doubles and were defeated by the Nui Kuwano team with 0-3 in the fourth week. The others all lost early. Although Meiji failed to sweep Hong Kong and Shanghai, it was still able to achieve satisfactory results in the expedition with second- and third-rate players from Japan. Therefore, the victory of the Shanghai Chinese team over them is not worth celebrating. It should be known that there are still many skilled players in the three islands of Fusang. Because they have major competitions held one after another, there are many opportunities to learn from each other. Compared with the few talents in our country and the slow progress, it cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Isn't it sad! (End)</p>

<h3>A Piece of Insight</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Why does a woman close her eyes when she kisses a man? This question is easy to solve. It is because it is a natural instinct of human beings, like a doe hiding in the forest when it sees the tracks of a hunter, a kind of ridiculous behavior.</p>
<p>Ordinary women, on average, spend almost half their lives (closing their eyes) pretending not to know or see. Because she knows that if she tells men everything in her heart, men will no longer be attached to her.</p>
<p>If a woman clearly tells her man that she loves him, it will surely scare him or make him feel pain. If she tells him she doesn't love him, it will hurt his vanity and ruin his self-esteem. So she can only close her eyes and give people a riddle to guess.</p>
<p>In the world, only the future is most likely to move people's hearts, and only dreams are most likely to excite people's interest. A riddle can make people go through fire and water without hesitation. The reason why women can bewitch all living beings lies only in this move.</p>
<p>Being afraid of one's wife is not a virtue for men, and at the same time, it will definitely not win the favor of women. Because most women will never love a man who is willing to be submissive, and what women hope for is to have a brave and decisive protector.</p>
<p>Love is sacred, but sin often occurs in love. The source of this sin is because people cannot understand sacred love.</p>
<h3>Radio Telephone in Hu Hanmin's Residence</h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>In recent years, science has flourished. Wireless telephones have become a very common means of communication. Those who are thousands of miles apart and need many days to travel by boat and car can communicate with each other in a few tens of minutes, which can be said to be very convenient. Many foreigners use wireless telephones. In the United States, it is said that nearly six or seven out of ten households use them, which shows its prevalence. Mr. Hu Zhantang, Speaker of the National Government's Legislative Yuan, installed a wireless telephone in his private residence in the capital in order to stay informed. The machine cost more than 200 gold, and the style is new and the sound is clear. Mr. Hu listens to all kinds of airwaves on the radio telephone in his spare time. He can listen to everything at will, such as the speeches of important people in the capital or the singing of the Little Luzon Opera Troupe. When the wireless telephone broadcasts, he can hear everything clearly. Therefore, although Mr. Hu is busy with official business every day, he has this kind of entertainment at home for recreation in his spare time. His spirit is very happy, and the news is extremely sensitive. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has recently ordered that this item be exempt from import and export duties in order to encourage the use of this kind of wireless telephone at home.</p>
<h3>Westernized Xi Zi</h3>
<p>— He Haisheng, sent from Hangzhou</p>
<p>Recently, most of our country's women have short hair, long stockings, leather shoes, and cheongsams, tending towards Westernization. Their posture is graceful and moving. As for our Hangzhou's West Lake, it has always been known for its lake and mountain scenery. In the past, Resident Dongpo had a poem saying, "If you compare West Lake to Xi Zi, it is always suitable whether lightly dressed or heavily made up." Therefore, West Lake is also known as Xi Zi Lake. Rich people leisurely wander among them, so Western-style houses stand in rows, and roads are built, bridges are transformed, and so on. West Lake is also gradually becoming Westernized.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Director of Public Works Zhu Yaoting demolished the stone tablet at Broken Bridge Remnant Snow to facilitate traffic. One of the Ten Scenes of West Lake is missing. Recently, Mayor Cai Zengji has also made many plans for the construction of West Lake, completing the asphalt roads around the lake, building public halls in four places: Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake, Ruangong Mound, and Lake Heart Pavilion, installing lights around the lake, building the Ge Ling Observatory, building boat wharves and docks, and adding gasoline machine ferries to save time for sightseeing. Guidance and reception centers for lake tours have been established. All construction projects use scientific methods and are created with artificial art. The Bureau of Public Works has been ordered to design and implement the projects so that the scenery of West Lake can be comparable to that of Europe and the United States. From then on, the natural beauty of Xi Zi Lake will be entirely transformed into a new trend and become a Westernized beauty. At the time of women with short, fluffy hair and leather shoes, those who come to visit Xi Zi Lake are no different from competing with Xi Zi in beauty. A smile. (Returned with thanks)</p>
<h3>Folk Customs of Leping</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Leping County belongs to the Xunyang Circuit of Jiangxi. The folk customs are savage, no different from outside the realm of civilization. There must be one or two armed fights every year. During the armed fights, hundreds or thousands of people often gather in the square, each holding knives and sticks, fighting bravely. If there are deaths or injuries, the blood-stained clothes are hung in the ancestral hall as a memorial. During the spring and autumn sacrifices, each side silently swears against the blood-stained clothes, regarding the other as an irreconcilable enemy, and the armed fight begins. Once there is an armed fight, the blood-stained clothes are added, so they are densely hung all over the ancestral hall. The bloody atmosphere is pungent and unbearable to see, and the feud becomes deeper and deeper, and there is no day to resolve it. A certain gentleman felt pity for them and thought that the blood-stained clothes were shocking to the eye and were the beginning of quarrels. He plotted to burn them to calm the people and no longer see the tragedy of severed necks and broken limbs. However, the plot was leaked and heard by the leader of the armed fight, who immediately built a high platform in the square and forced the gentleman to sit on it. After he ascended the seat, he removed the ladder and then made his followers bow down below, ostensibly to express their gratitude for his virtue, but secretly cutting off his food and drink, exposing him to the sun and rain, and wanting to kill him. Sure enough, he died in less than three days. Although the authorities knew about it, there was nothing they could do. This is a recent event, told by a Gan friend who came to avoid the Communist bandits.</p>
<h3>What I Know About the Anhui Bandit Three-Legged</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>I read the article "Three-Legged, the Bandit Leader of Guangde" written by Wenxia in the 30th issue of this journal. The description of his deeds is very detailed. When I lived in She County in the past, I knew his deeds very well, so I wrote them in Free Talk to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Three-Legged originally had no great name. He was from She County. His surname was Wang. His ancestors were extremely noble, but by the time of Three-Legged, his family had declined, and he was no longer as heroic as he used to be. Three-Legged was born with a strange personality. He liked to walk in narrow alleys. When he was studying in a private school, he could support himself on the narrow walls with both hands and two feet and climb to the top of the house. His peers all admired his skills. When he grew up, he learned the tea business. Anhui tea leaves are usually sold with tung oil. The distance from the stack to the shop may be more than a mile, so the apprentices who are hired must be strong and powerful to be responsible for the transportation. For others, each bucket of tung oil must be transported by two people, but not for Three-Legged. He carries it on his shoulder and walks as usual. He usually wears iron sheets between his knees and ankles as usual. Over time, he can walk very fast. Once he removes the iron sheets, he can travel a hundred miles in an instant. This is the origin of the name Three-Legged. However, since Three-Legged started his business, he still did not reduce his old habit of walking diagonally in narrow alleys. He was repeatedly reprimanded by the manager and left the store in anger. At that time, bandits in Anhui were rising, and the people held self-defense groups. Because of this, Three-Legged was able to join the Huining County self-defense group and serve as a police officer. He learned the skills of the divine painter there. However, since then, She County has never seen his踪跡 again. At first, he did not expect that he would fall into the hands of bandits. I have not returned to my hometown since I went to Anhui five years ago because of something. Fish and geese are mostly misunderstood by Hong Qiao, and wandering sons often miss their hometown. Recently, home reports say that bandits are rampant everywhere. Reading Xiajun's article, I can't help but feel sad. With Three-Legged's body and unique skills, he should have followed the right path but did not, but harmed the villages and towns, which is really a pity.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Incident in a Melon Field</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Villagers often build sheds with supports and curtains in their melon fields to guard against theft, calling them melon sheds, where they sleep day and night. This year, a tragic incident occurred in a melon shed in Cibei, Zhejiang, involving a ferocious beast devouring a person, which is so extraordinary and horrifying that it is recorded here.</p>
<p>In Cibei, there was a farmer named Zhang, who grew melons every year as a side income. This year, he planted three mu of watermelons, and the harvest was abundant. Although he worked hard day and night, sleeping in the melon field and carrying melons to the market, he did not feel it was too difficult. One day last month, Zhang carried melons to the market, expecting to be gone overnight. Before leaving, he entrusted his wife with the responsibility of guarding the melon field at night. It is common for a wife to take over when her husband is away. Zhang had only one wife and one son, who was not yet ten years old. In the evening, the wife locked the door and took her son to the melon field. Under the bright stars and moon and the gentle evening breeze, the mother and son chatted happily, finding it enjoyable. After a while, the child grew tired and fell into a deep sleep. The mother felt lonely and also fell asleep. Later that night, the bed suddenly shook, and the mother woke up in fright. Through her sleepy eyes, she saw a ferocious beast climbing onto the bed. Terrified, she wanted to scream, but her son's cries of agony revealed that he had already been snatched away. The mother was extremely anxious and screamed as she gave chase. However, the beast moved quickly and was soon out of reach. In the darkness, she could only hear her son's agonizing cries. She continued to follow the sound, but soon it fell silent. She stood there and wailed loudly. In the vast wilderness at night, who could come to her aid? Feeling helpless, she rushed back home and woke up the neighbors, telling them what had happened. Dozens of strong men, carrying lamps and weapons, followed the mother in pursuit. They searched tirelessly, but to no avail. The commotion continued throughout the night, but it was all in vain. As dawn approached, they suddenly saw splashes of blood on the boundary. The crowd followed the blood forward, and the blood led them to a grove of trees. There was even more blood there, and they found two white bones. Deeper in the forest, they discovered a head. The mother looked down and recognized the familiar features. It was indeed her son. She picked up the head and wailed in grief, nearly fainting. The crowd quickly helped the mother, carried the head, and returned home together. They hurried to the market to tell Zhang what had happened. Zhang's grief was even greater than his wife's, as he was over fifty years old, and this son was born to him in his later years. His wife was also past childbearing age, and he felt even more pitiful for his future.</p>
<h3>New Knowledge for the Family</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, reports have surfaced about people in Shanghai being injured by strong acid thrown at their faces. In fact, there are three types of strong acid, which are strong acids. However, regardless of nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or hydrochloric acid, they can all be neutralized with magnesium carbonate. "Invincible Brand" toothpaste uses magnesium carbonate as its main ingredient. To prove this, if you put strong acid in a glass and pour in toothpaste, it will immediately turn into Dutch water and lose its corrosive properties. Therefore, if strong acid splashes onto the skin, do not wipe it with water, as this will only spread the damage. Instead, quickly pour "Invincible Brand" toothpaste onto it, and the strong acid will be absorbed and neutralized. Then, wash it off with water and apply more toothpaste. This will not only immediately relieve the pain but also prevent scarring. If you wipe it with your hands or a handkerchief first, the skin will become uneven and scarred after healing.</p>
<p>Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and oxalic acid can be fatal if swallowed. However, if you quickly mix "Invincible Brand" toothpaste with water to form a milky liquid and administer it to the person, the magnesium hydroxide will immediately neutralize the strong acid wherever it reaches, effectively turning danger into safety. "Invincible Brand" stomach medicine is especially effective, as it is made with magnesium oxide, and one dose is equivalent to three doses of other medications.</p>
<p>For skin burns caused by caustic soda, caustic potash, or ammonia, wash with boric acid or citric acid solution. If these are not readily available, wash with "Invincible Brand" soda water for immediate relief (this type of soda water, also known as Dutch water, is most effective with lemon flavor). Then, apply "Invincible Brand" type B frostbite ointment.</p>
<p>For burns caused by hot water or fire, apply "Invincible Brand" butterfly cream for good results. Alternatively, mix "Invincible Brand" toothpaste with Westin oil or hair cream and apply it to relieve pain and reduce swelling, preventing suppuration.</p>
<p>For any type of boil or sore that does not heal for a long time, apply a small amount of "Invincible Brand" toothpaste, and it will scab over and heal overnight.</p>
<p>When fire alcohol lamps or kerosene stoves run out of fuel, "Invincible Brand" cologne can be used as a substitute. (栩)</p>
<h3>The Roman Catholic Church's Dissent Regarding Chinese Customs (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Liu Zeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>According to a recent dispatch from Rome published in the Paris Times, the Holy Office of the Vatican has reaffirmed its 1710 ruling prohibiting discussions on whether the Catholic Church can permit Chinese people to honor Confucius and their ancestors. The ruling claims that these customs are merely disguised idol worship.</p>
<p>The issue involved in this dispatch has a long history. Two hundred years ago, Catholics in China were already engaged in fierce disputes over this matter, causing a great sensation. Now that the old issue has been brought up again, it is feared that it will inevitably cause many more disputes. There are many writings discussing this issue, and the process is quite interesting.</p>
<p>The Jesuit order first established itself in China in the mid-16th century. From that time on, it was the fierce rival of the Dominican order. It is well known that these two orders represent two opposing tendencies within the Catholic Church. The Jesuit order emphasizes spirituality and neglects dogma, while the Dominican order believes that everything is false except for the Bible. The conflict between the two orders began with a dispute over a sacred book in the Spanish religious court. Therefore, it was expected that there would be fierce disturbances in China. In 1633, the Spanish Dominican order, jealous of the success of the Jesuit order in spreading religion in China, also launched a large-scale eastward expansion. After arriving in China, they claimed that the emperors and sages of China were suffering in hell, and the Qing court issued a ban, ordering them to stop such preaching or be immediately expelled.</p>
<p>Having gained the upper hand in China, the Dominican order became increasingly angry with the Jesuit order, criticizing them for allowing Chinese believers to continue worshiping their ancestors and Confucius, thereby preserving their original superstitions. On September 12, 1645, Pope Innocent X, at the request of the Dominican order, issued an edict prohibiting Chinese Catholics from performing any rituals for the dead. However, the Jesuit order did not comply with the edict. On March 23, 1656, Pope Alexander VII ordered the Jesuit order to explain why they were allowing the Chinese to worship their ancestors.</p>
<p>The open and secret struggles between the two orders continued until the early years of the Kangxi reign. At that time, the southeastern provinces often reported illegal activities by the Spanish Dominican order. The Qing court issued an order on January 4, 1665, prohibiting all Catholic preaching. Missionaries were placed under surveillance.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (269)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears Stain Her Heart, Red Lotus Fragrance Fades as a Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Cuiyun had bought her freedom, and her body was finally free. However, she was now under economic pressure. That particular customer wanted her to continue her life as a prostitute. It was like a freed serf who had to establish his own business and support his family, or like a newly independent country that had to prepare for all kinds of construction. Money was essential. However, if you needed money immediately, the creditor groups in the brothel world were already circling around you. However, they had very strict conditions and very high interest rates. Cuiyun was a timid person and did not dare to take on too much debt. However, if you wanted to start a new chapter, running things independently, renting a room, and trying to make a name for yourself, you couldn't be worse off than before. Before, you were a colony, a protected state. Now that you were independent, you had to put on a show so you wouldn't be laughed at. That meant you had to pay attention to detail, and in order to satisfy this desire to win, you couldn't help but borrow a little more money. Moreover, in that kind of society, it was a snobbish society. They said, "If you don't spend small money, you won't make big money." If your room was well-decorated, fully equipped, and everything you used was of the highest quality, you would naturally attract higher-class customers. Second-class customers would often be intimidated by your grandeur and retreat, knowing their limits. If you had a downstairs room that was not fully equipped, with no stove in the winter and no fan in the summer, and customers came to drink and play mahjong but you didn't have anything, with bums always standing at the door, the customers would frown when they stepped inside, feeling that they would lose face inviting guests to such a place. So, you would attract a group of customers who were just barely acceptable, and there would often be brawls and damage to the room. Both the host and the guests would be embarrassed. Higher-class customers would never do such things. As the saying goes, "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." This is true in all things, and a brothel is no exception. The price of Cuiyun's independence was seven or eight hundred yuan. If Huayunting had paid that seven or eight hundred yuan, she could have paid off the principal and interest. When she first opened her room, her business was not bad. Although she couldn't squeeze into the ranks of top-tier celebrities in the flower world, she could be considered a second-tier celebrity. At that time, the society of courtesans was divided into literary and military factions. The military faction was flamboyant, liked to argue and make noise, and their attire was deliberately strange. The literary faction was quiet, good at socializing, and skilled in rhetoric. The military faction sang black-faced male roles and old male roles, while the literary faction sang Kunqu opera and Qingyi roles. However, at that time, the trend was gradually changing, with more emphasis on the military and less on the literary. Those girls who sang nonsense tunes, slept with actors and grooms, were liked by many customers. They couldn't talk to the quiet girls and found them boring. Therefore, you could observe the changes in the world in the brothel world.</p>

<h3>Weakness in Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>The situation is trending downwards. The gold market trend on the 4th was weak, with no major changes, but the volatility was high, with fluctuations of more than two liang at times. The total fluctuation for the day was about six liang. People were confused and the situation was chaotic. Foreign exchange was slightly tight, and trading was limited. Among the firms, Dada Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and others were actively selling, while Taikang Runyi and others were buying. Other firms had mixed inflows and outflows. The market was weak from the early morning, mainly because the silver market was slightly lower. There were rumors that Bombay was selling silver, but according to telegrams, this was completely false. Major players were competing to sell, and prices fell to the 60 liang mark. Afterwards, prices rose and fell, fluctuating between 60 and 62 liang. Later, sellers dominated the market, and exchange rates were particularly weak. With poor market sentiment, the 60 liang mark was broken.</p>
<p>Lingering Around the 60 Liang Mark. The opening price in the early morning of October was 564.2 liang, a decrease of 1.6 liang. However, the major banks have reduced by 16/3, and the silver price has been reduced by 1/4, but it is not moving, because the number of reductions is insufficient. Shortly afterwards, from around 64 liang, it rose to 5.23 liang. Before long, it headed downwards, with Dada Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and others actively selling. When the initial quotations were released, it was only 60.08 liang. It then dropped to 60.02 liang. At this time, HSBC sold October English gold for 7 pence 4375. Japanese banks mutually traded for 3125 this month. Afterwards, Bombay had a purchase price for November at 7 pence and a half, and with Yiyu and others buying, it increased by more than 2 liang to 62.67 liang at 10:30. However, hedgers continued to sell, and it retreated to 60.03 liang. From 10:15 to 10:45, there were fluctuations of 2.56 liang in this half hour. After 11:00, retail investors bought, and banks bought Japanese and American exchange rates for the end of the year at 49 yuan and 16/5. It rose by 2 liang to 62.2 liang, but then dropped by one liang to 61 liang. After 11:30, it rose slightly, but only by 78 qian. The amounts traded by each firm were small. The closing price at noon was 61.4 liang, and the quoted price was still 622.2 liang, between 61.2 liang and 60 liang.</p>
<p>Falling Prices Inside the Customs. The opening price in the afternoon was 61.2 liang, followed by 2.4 liang. In the later session, sellers seemed strong, especially Indian exchange rates, which increased by 2 annas. First, HSBC and Datong did a deal for October at 7 pence and a half. When the same price could be settled, the gold price slowly moved downwards, falling by more than 3 liang. After 3:00, it broke the 60 liang mark, falling to 58.78 liang. After 3:30, there were some buyers, so it rebounded by 1 liang. Afterwards, Indian exchange rates turned down, and prices continued to fall. At 3:50, it was 60.5 liang. After 4:00, the downward trend continued, with Hengxing and others selling, falling by 2 liang. At the closing price at 4:30, it was 558.6 liang, a decrease of 7.2 liang compared to the previous day. The market has been hesitant recently, with unpredictable ups and downs. The highest price of the day was 65.3 liang, and the lowest price was 58.6 liang, a difference of 6.7 liang. The quoted price was around 60 liang, and the final result was more than 63 liang. The recorded prices were from 72 liang to 61 liang, and the water compensation was from 72 liang to 70 liang. The morning goods were priced at 4.3 qian, the afternoon at 1.3 qian, the afternoon at 1.2 qian, and the closing price was 58.8 qian.</p>
<p>Extremely Chaotic Inflows and Outflows. Transactions by various firms were mixed and diverse. Dada Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Hengxing, Yifeng Yong, Changsheng Yong, and others all had sales. Jinan, Shunli, Yiyu, Wanxing, Taikang Run, and others all had purchases. Zhifeng Yong, Senchang Yong, Yuancheng Yong, Chunfa Yong, Chunyuan Yong, Futai Heng, and Yongsheng Chang all had uncertain inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Yuan Mao Yong, Yongcheng Chang, Shunli, Senchang Yong, and others had inconsistent inflows and outflows. Bingxing, Dakang, Yuancheng, Taikang Run, Yuancheng Yong, Xieyu, and others all sold. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, and retail investors all had purchases. Dalian merchants bought more and sold less, with more than 1,000 purchases and more than 200 sales. Guangdong merchants remained inactive, with only a few selling, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Trends Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed prices and foreign exchange rates remained unchanged. However, overseas silver markets fell back, and European market trends reversed, showing a hardening trend.

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Markets Slightly Upward</h3>
<p>The yarn market has risen slightly, but the trend is still softening. In reality, the environment is not good, most people are looking down, and the situation is unstable, resulting in sluggish sales and making it difficult for the market to develop. Furthermore, the Cantonese bulls, who had the strongest thoughts the day before, have already let go due to the poor overall situation. Therefore, the market is slack. Although the situation in the business community is false, it has fallen by 80-90 liang compared to the highest time. There are relatively few new throwers, and there are many empty pickers who have profited, so the market price may have a period of consolidation.</p>
<p>The evening market for Renbiao is also soft. The opening market for Renbiao was still firm, because Ruida was mostly empty, and the market price rose by 2.5-6 qian.

<h3>The Cotton Market Remains Steady</h3>
<p>The cotton market started firm but then weakened. However, the overseas cotton market situation is flat. Most local sentiments are due to the excessive rainfall, which has damaged cotton plants. Many buyers are purchasing temporarily, and the buying force is particularly strong, so the market atmosphere is tight. However, the Indian and American cotton markets are sluggish, and new buyers are still scarce. Therefore, although the atmosphere is tight, the market price has not risen sharply, mainly because the actual situation is unusually pessimistic.</p>
<p>Hankow Standards Remain Stable. The Hankow standard cotton market opened higher due to the heavy rain and nervous sentiment, rising by one or two cents initially. However, some selling occurred, leading to a decline. When the weather cleared at the close, prices fell again, resulting in a drop of five cents for near-term contracts and unchanged prices for distant ones. In the afternoon, the weather cleared, and bulls sold off, but Hankow buyers stepped in, resulting in flat prices for all months. The total daily turnover was 40,300 bales.

<h3>Rice Market Firm in the Lower Reaches of the Grain River</h3>

The ordinary market opened 20 yuan and 9 jiao higher, about 1 jiao tighter than the previous market. The general trend can only stabilize when the weather clears. All new Shin粳 opened at 18 yuan and a half, and the market was more upward, mainly because of the shortage of supply. There were few arrivals and transactions of thin稻米.

<h3>Imported Rice in Short Supply Shows a Strong Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was still stable and firm, because the inventory in the market was less than 10,000 bags, including returned goods and the hoarding of rice shops, so the number of owners was also very small. Among the inventories, Saigon No. 1 was more abundant, about 5,000 bags, but the owners' minds were very firm, and they were unwilling to sell cheaply when 客秈 arrived in large quantities. Therefore, the entire market only had Ningbo brokers who went to 大絞 for 800 bags, at a price of 12 yuan and 6 jiao to 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>5,000 Bags of New Gan Xian Arrived</h3>
<p>客秈 Xiang rice was blocked and could not arrive. The source of Jiangxi rice was very good. Yesterday, another 5,000 bags of new rice arrived, as well as 120 bags of Nanjing new rice.

Northern brokers, such as Qinhuangdao and Qingdao, took away more than 20,000 bags of spot flour, causing the futures for this month to naturally tighten again, approaching the short positions of the factories, because although sales are not very abundant, the northern sales move and the people are finally feeling expensive, so the short covering of the near and far term contracts is quite urgent, so the market atmosphere of each month is also inclined to the bullish side. As a result, this month rose by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, October rose by 1.75 fen, November rose by 1.75 fen, December rose by 1 fen, January rose by 1.25 fen, and January rose by 1 fen.</p>

When the market opened in the afternoon, because the actual sales of the flour market had moved, it turned from fixed to brisk, so the buying of each month also followed, and it was 2 or 3 fen better than in the morning. Observing this, if the flour market continues to increase, the wheat market will also be stable. As a result, September and October did not move, November was 2 fen better, December was 1 fen better, January was 2 fen better, and February was 1 fen better. Each factory in the current wheat market has abundant inventory, and because the resale in the market is very strong and the source is also continuous, they are all watching and intending to suppress slightly, so the whole market has not opened.</p>

<p>Since the exchange rate of 200-pound Association steel has tended to rise, the standard has slightly decreased. In recent days, the export brokers’ needs have gradually moved, and the decoration of the factories in this street also means that the total daily transaction has a large amount of 600-700 boxes, but the source is sparse, because there is a trend of supply falling short of demand, the people's hearts are showing outstanding beauty, and the market atmosphere is expanding, so the price of each box has risen several yuan. Currently, Mitsui is estimated at 20 taels and 5 qian, Fengyu is 22 taels and 5 qian, Meikang is 22 taels, Weili is 21 taels and 5 qian, and other miscellaneous brands are estimated at 21 taels.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Strict Preparations for September 7th</h3>
<p>The military, police, and various agencies in this port, given the repeated victories on the front lines, are especially concerned about the defense of the rear. Moreover, the communist bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have not yet been completely suppressed. Shanghai, being a prosperous area for industry and commerce, is deeply concerned that communist party members may spread and flow into Shanghai, inciting strikes and class boycotts, harming the local area. Therefore, for several days, the defense of this port, especially in important areas, has been under temporary curfew in the evenings. Recently, an order from the Nanjing Headquarters stated that the communist party is plotting something in Shanghai, and precautions must be taken. Therefore, after receiving the order yesterday, the military, police, and various agencies have been under strict alert.</p>
<p>Ren Liping, the district head of the sixth district of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, announced a temporary special alert starting at 6:00 PM yesterday. In addition to immediately notifying all sub-bureau chiefs, sub-station chiefs, and patrol officers under his jurisdiction to increase the number of officers patrolling in shifts for strict inspections and to strengthen defenses, he also ordered Patrol Officer Xu to lead a long police squad on patrol, traveling to and from Avenue du President Benes, Avenue Haig, and Robison Road, for strict inspections. Special attention was given to areas near factories. Liu Shaoqing, the leader of the detective team stationed in the district, also led all detectives to the key points for strict inspections, creating a rather tense atmosphere. It is also reported that there were similar alerts in the Zhabei area, and the 5th Division stationed there also dispatched a team on patrol.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Opposes Water Price Increase</h3>
<p>214 Representatives</p>
<p>Five Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to increase the price of tap water by 25%, residents within the concession have expressed their firm opposition. The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, acting on behalf of all residents, specifically convened a representative assembly at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce this afternoon to discuss countermeasures. The Shanghai Real Estate Association held a general meeting the night before, attended by 214 representatives from various real estate companies, including Shen Lianfang, Kui Yanfang, Shen Guangyan, Lu Shaotang, Ye Shantao, Dou Yaoting, Li Bohan, and Jiang Bingsheng, to discuss the opposition to the tap water price increase. Gong Kui Yanfang was elected chairman, and Tao Leqin served as secretary. The chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that tap water is a daily necessity for all residents and a public utility, which should not be equated with private profit-seeking enterprises. Therefore, the impact of a price increase would be significant, and residents were already strongly opposed. Furthermore, the original price of tap water was only 0.5%, and the price for foreign houses was 0.4%, and this had not increased for decades, but rents have continuously increased. Tap water prices have, in effect, been increasing every year. The 20% increase in 1927 was unreasonable, and now another increase is being proposed. There is no telling where it would end, which is unacceptable to the residents. Those present then engaged in discussion, resulting in the following resolutions: (1) The association will issue a declaration; (2) A letter of protest will be sent to the water company; (3) The Shanghai Municipal Council will be requested to reconsider the matter; (4) The Chinese Ratepayers Association will be requested to mediate, with the association pledging its support; (5) Letters will be sent to various organizations to represent the public opinion of residents and jointly strive for their rights. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3>New Director-General of China Merchants Group to Take Office</h3>
<p>Li Zhonggong's Assumption of Office</p>
<p>Following Li Zhonggong's, the newly appointed Vice Minister of Transportation, appointment as the new Director-General of the China Merchants Group, Li has gone to Beijing to consult with Minister Wang on fundamental reforms for the group. He was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today to take office, and the acting Director-General Cai Pei was also prepared to hand over his duties. However, reliable information was received yesterday stating that Li is still in Beijing for negotiations, which have not yet been completed, and he will therefore not be able to take office in Shanghai as scheduled. It is now expected that he will be able to come to Shanghai to take office next Monday, the 8th. Acting Director-General Cai will go to Beijing immediately after Li's arrival.</p>
<p>Beijing Telegram</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong has been in Beijing for several days, discussing plans for the reorganization of the China Merchants Group and the Jinliyuan Wharf negotiation case with the National Government authorities and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Transportation. There are signs of progress. He will go to Shanghai to take over the matter in a few days.</p>
<p>Salary Payments to Staff</p>
<p>The group is two months behind in paying salaries to its staff and workers. After discussions between Acting Director-General Cai and Director-General Li Weihou, funds have been borrowed and delivered to the group. Yesterday, Acting Director-General Cai announced to all staff that one month's back pay would be paid today to help them maintain their livelihoods. Yesterday, all departments were preparing receipts in anticipation of receiving payment today.</p>
<h3>British Minister to Come to Shanghai and then Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", news received in Shanghai today states that the British Minister, Sir Miles Lampson, will depart from Beidaihe tomorrow (the 5th) to come to Shanghai and then proceed to the capital.</p>
<h3>Ratepayers Association to Hold General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association will hold its third representative assembly at 2:00 PM today at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the opposition to the tap water price increase and the resignation of Chinese Director Bei Songsun. Both matters are important cases. According to a key member of the association yesterday, reports in the newspaper today stating that the association had already approved Director Bei's resignation are not true. Neither the Standing Committee nor the Executive Committee of the association has the authority to decide on the resignation of a Chinese director. The matter must be discussed at the representative assembly. Therefore, whether Director Bei's resignation will be approved is still uncertain and must be decided at today's representative assembly.</p>
<h3>Postponement of Abolishing Likin and Implementing New Tariff</h3>
<p>Due to the current situation, the Ministry of Finance's scheduled date to abolish likin and implement the national tariff will not be reached.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's announcement to abolish likin and promulgate the national tariff was originally scheduled to take effect on October 10th of this year. That date is rapidly approaching. Although measures to compensate for the loss of revenue after the abolition of likin are being actively planned, the matter is of great importance and cannot be implemented in a short period of time. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that the scheduled implementation date will be postponed. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited a senior official of the Ministry of Finance at the Central Bank yesterday to inquire about the truth of the matter. According to the official, the current military situation makes it difficult for various provinces to abolish likin in practice. Although the business tax and other measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance are good ways to compensate for likin, the ongoing military operations have prevented most provinces from implementing them. Even Jiangsu Province, which has begun preparations, has difficulty estimating when the implementation will begin. Therefore, given the current situation, it is impossible to meet the scheduled implementation date of October 10th. Consequently, the abolition of likin and the promulgation of the national tariff must be postponed until the twentieth year (1931).</p>
<h3>National Goods Preservation Association Requests Implementation of National Tariff</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Preservation Association recently sent a telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan and various ministries, requesting the implementation of the national tariff, stating that the executive committee member Shen Shuyu had suggested sending a telegram to the National Government to promptly announce and set a date for the implementation of the national tariff rates by customs. This suggestion was approved at the 19th session of the 25th Executive Committee meeting. The current temporary tariff implemented by customs was originally intended to be a one-year trial, which has now expired. It is urgently necessary to use customs to protect the domestic goods trade policy and promulgate the national tariff rates in order to nurture the development of domestic goods and block a huge financial leak. The association respectfully sends this telegram earnestly requesting the relevant government bodies to review and approve the implementation and set a date for promulgation, so as to reassure industry and commerce and rescue financial resources. The association is awaiting orders with the utmost urgency.</p>
<h3>Preparations Underway for the Third Annual National Goods Promotion Week in This City</h3>

<h3>Japan Mail Company Suspends Many Ships and Reduces Services</h3>
<p>A List of Ships Suspended on European and American Routes</p>
<p>After the Japan Mail Company added nine new ships this year, it now has ninety-six ships, totaling 613,000 tons. Due to the fact that the shipping industry in Europe and the United States is experiencing a surplus of ships and a shortage of cargo, the company has been gradually reducing services on various routes since last month. The ships that have already been suspended include: (1) Korea Maru, 11,810 tons; (2) Tianjin Maru, 12,420 tons; (3) Siberia Maru, 12,790 tons; (4) Kanagawa Maru, 5,851 tons; (5) Aki Maru, 6,022 tons; (6) Iyo Maru, 5,926 tons; (7) Sado Maru, 5,898 tons; (8) Awa Maru, 6,028 tons; (9) Kaga Maru, 6,512 tons; (10) Ceylon Maru, 4,950 tons; (11) Nagano Maru, 3,824 tons; (12) Tamba Maru, 5,844 tons.

<p>Reduced Services on New York Route</p>
<p>On the Shanghai to New York route, the number of new British, American and Norwegian ships has greatly increased this year. The speed is extremely fast. Due to excessive competition, business has become slow. The company has decided to reduce four ships from this month, leaving only thirteen ships with a total of 55,500 tons traveling back and forth.</p>
<h3>Japanese Again Refuse Large Numbers of Chinese to Return to China</h3>
<p>After the Japanese authorities banned Chinese laborers from landing in Japan, all those who went were expelled. Overseas Chinese in Tokyo and Yokohama, due to the rising gold prices, and ending their livelihoods, were sent back to their country by the Japanese authorities in an unending stream. Recently, some Chinese going to Japan were strictly prohibited from landing by the Japanese coast guard. Chinese people in the Minamisenju area of Tokyo, Nanseicho of Kyoto and Fukagawa Hongo of Yokohama, who were engaged in hairdressing and the restaurant business, etc., were arrested by the Japanese authorities and driven back to Shanghai. There were also Liang Shaokui, Zhou Keqin, Hu Yinhe, Gao Jinsheng, Lin Wenda, Li Shanping, Liang Zhaozhen, Fang Azhuo, Le Quansheng, Xiang Kexiang, Yu Yufa, Tang Yannian, Zheng Baishu, Zhang Zhongbin, Xu Yaolie and dozens of others, who were expelled back to Shanghai in three batches. Most of them are from Qingtian and Guoxi in Wenzhou. They were all in dire straits when they arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Organize Security Detachments</h3>
<p>Recently, because the central government's troops in Hunan and Hubei provinces are actively suppressing bandits, the British and Japanese merchant ships traveling on the Yangtze River are deeply concerned that dangers will arise. Therefore, they have successively requested and received the approval of their respective ministers to dispatch marine corps members to protect the ships. The Jardine Matheson Company, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Nissin Kisen Kaisha and other merchant ships traveling on the Yangtze River will, from today, have temporary security detachments organized by the marine corps on board to provide armed protection.</p>

<h3>Labor Dispute in Shipbuilding Resolved</h3>
<p>Agreement Reached on Four Conditions</p>
<p>The workers in the shipbuilding industry in this city previously demanded improved treatment and submitted three demands to the Shipbuilding Industry Association. After declaring a strike on the 23rd of last month, the Municipal Party Committee mediated, and as a result, wages were increased by eight cents per worker, and work was resumed. However, the Shipbuilding Industry Association, as the ships being built were all commissioned by members of the Ningbo Coal and Stone Transport Association, then requested an increase of 12% in the construction price and an increase in meal costs from the association. As they had not sought prior consent, the Ningbo Coal Transport Association did not agree to the increase and requested compensation from the Shipbuilding Industry Association for the losses incurred during the strike, leading to a dispute. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened both parties to mediate. The meeting was chaired by Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>

<h3>Overseas Chinese United Association Again Requests Repeal of Passport Law</h3>
<p>Lists Ten Reasons</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese United Association of the Republic of China, telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the association's request to repeal the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' promulgated Provisional Regulations for Exit and Entry Passports, the Executive Yuan's reply, forwarded by the Secretariat of the National Government under document number 4974, instructs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reconsider. For returning overseas Chinese who are indeed impoverished and unable to pay the fees, the overseas embassies and consulates should be instructed to consider waiving the fees. The reply also states that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to draft a passport law to address any imperfections in the provisional regulations, and once drafted, it will be submitted to the Yuan and then to the National Government for submission to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and promulgation. Upon receiving this, we believe that the passport provisional regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs impose excessive fees and contain many errors. Overseas party branches and overseas Chinese organizations have repeatedly appealed for revisions and reductions. The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also considers the passport law for returning overseas Chinese to be inappropriate and strongly advocates for its repeal. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should understand the hardships of overseas Chinese and immediately repeal the law, stop collecting fees, and wait until a revised passport law is drafted, submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, and promulgated before implementing it according to law. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not realize its illegality and wants to protect its improper benefits. It uses partial fee waivers as a way to appease the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's proposal to repeal the passport law, and uses vague phrases such as "(indeed impoverished)" and "(consideration for fee waiver)," giving unscrupulous consuls an excuse for demanding and nitpicking. Furthermore, it shows a lack of trust in overseas Chinese, suspecting that overseas Chinese who followed Premier Sun Yat-sen and supported the revolution are all pretending to be poor to avoid passport fees, humiliating the dignity of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese would rather die than accept such charity. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs treats the requests from various overseas Chinese organizations for fee reductions as insignificant and delays responding. It also allows lower-level officials of the ministry to collude with travel agencies to handle passport applications privately, extorting 26 Hong Kong dollars per passport. (According to the Batavia Tiansheng Daily and Surabaya Dagong Commercial Daily, Hong Kong's Anqing Hall and Guangzhou's Guangmeichang Zhong Junrao and others are colluding with lower-level officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle passport applications privately, charging up to 26 Hong Kong dollars per passport, as evidenced by receipts from travel agencies.) The association believes that this matter concerns the support of all overseas Chinese and dares not avoid speaking out. We respectfully present our loyal views to the government again: (1) All laws and regulations that increase the burden on the people must be deliberated by the legislative branch. During this period of political tutelage, the Legislative Yuan is specifically responsible for legislation. If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that overseas Chinese, who have always had freedom of entry and exit, must have passports to be restricted, it should have carefully drafted regulations from the beginning and submitted them to the Legislative Yuan for discussion and revision. Instead, it violated procedures and privately promulgated the regulations, using the term "(provisional)" to try to cover up its mistakes. Moreover, there is no time limit for the so-called "(provisional)" regulations. When someone raises objections, the ministry presents a reply to revise them on one hand and vigorously collects fees on the other. There is no telling when the revision will be completed, and there is no limit to the burden on overseas Chinese. If no one raises objections, the regulations will go from provisional to permanent, and the Legislative Yuan will never know about this matter. Other government agencies will follow suit. The benefits will go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while the responsibility will be borne by the entire government. For the sake of respecting legislative procedures and maintaining the government's credibility, we must request that the regulations be strictly repealed. (2) The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has the responsibility of guiding and supervising matters related to the migration and protection of overseas Chinese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should have solicited the opinions of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission when drafting the passport law. Instead, it acted arbitrarily, privately drafting and promulgating the regulations, so that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission could only send a letter after the fact to request fee waivers and could not express its approval or disapproval beforehand. For the sake of respecting the authority of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and maintaining the credibility of the party, we must request that the regulations be strictly repealed. (3) Most people who go abroad are seeking a livelihood. The vast majority of poor people are in this situation. Given the current preciousness of gold and cheapness of silver, even traveling in the lowest class of steerage requires several tens to over a hundred yuan in ship fare. Those going to the Dutch East Indies must also prepay an entry tax of 100 guilders, equivalent to over 140 yuan in national currency. Adding the travel expenses from the mainland to the port and the lodging tax for waiting for passports at the port, it already costs around 300 yuan. When begging is not enough, people resort to selling their property. When selling property is not enough, they resort to selling their children. Is such a tragic situation that moves even ghosts and gods not enough to move the pity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Yet, it levies a huge fee of eight yuan under the guise of passports. Other extortions are even double that amount. Is this truly necessary for handling affairs? The Ministry of Interior Affairs only charges six jiao for issuing certificates of nationality and has even specially requested and received approval to waive the stamp duty. What the Ministry of Interior can do, can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not do? Both ministries are located in the capital, and their cost of living should not be that different. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs only knows how to benefit itself. How can refugees escape with their lives? If they cannot escape, they will turn into bandits, and the bandits will multiply, leading to endless disasters. For the sake of maintaining the people's livelihood and reducing banditry, we must request that the regulations be strictly repealed. (4) Exit passports are required by foreign countries, while return passports are purely a matter of our country's sovereignty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs uses the excuse that "(returning without a passport may disrupt public order)" and stipulates that "(citizens returning without a return passport will be detained and investigated by the customs at the port of entry)." This is intentionally alarmist and unreasonable. From a rational perspective, overseas Chinese returning to China is an innate right. What crime is there in not having a passport? On what legal basis are they being detained and investigated? If this is implemented, it will be treating overseas Chinese as specially prohibited items, giving customs officers the opportunity to extort money, forcing impoverished overseas Chinese to die in foreign lands, unable to return home, and treating them as outcasts like bandits, consistent with the exclusion policies of various countries. The government's "(Regulations for Encouraging Overseas Chinese to Return and Invest in Industries)" and "(Measures for Overseas Chinese Children to Study in China)" will be destroyed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' passport law and will become mere empty words. Is it reasonable that the fervent support of Premier Sun Yat-sen by overseas Chinese is repaid with such cruelty? From a factual perspective, passports cannot determine whether a person is good or bad. Even communists will find ways to obtain passports. Setting up passports to protect good people is actually protecting communists. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's proposal to "(exempt overseas Chinese from return passports)" is not without merit. For the sake of comforting overseas Chinese and maintaining overseas Chinese relations, we must request that the regulations be strictly repealed. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Certifies Share Capital of Zhenghua Bank</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a certificate yesterday to prove the amount of paid-up share capital of Zhenghua Bank, stating: Regarding the matter of certification, according to the letter from Zhenghua Bank, it raised 100,000 yuan in capital in April of this year, first collecting 50,000 yuan, and was established. It was registered with the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the actual receipt of capital was verified by a dispatched official. Now, in accordance with banking regulations, it intends to submit a report to the Ministry of Finance for registration, and it is required that the Chamber of Commerce certify the actual receipt of capital, etc., and requests that we certify it in accordance with regulations. Our Chamber then presented a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate whether the company's claim that the authorized capital stock was 100,000 yuan, with 50,000 yuan collected first, was true. The Bureau of Social Affairs issued approval No. 1007, dispatching an official to investigate and verify that it was true. Therefore, the company has actually received a share capital of 50,000 yuan, which is indeed the actual situation. A certificate is hereby issued as follows:</p>
<h3>Labor Union of the Commercial Press: Declaration Regarding the Incident of American Citizen Running Over and Killing Lu Lianqiao</h3>
<p>The Labor Union of the Commercial Press of Shanghai issued a declaration regarding the incident of American citizen Hays driving a car and killing Lu Lianqiao, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the lack of trial in court. We respectfully inform all newspaper offices and fellow countrymen. Since the occupation of Chinese territory by imperialists, they have relied on consular jurisdiction as a protective charm, recklessly and violently harming people, disregarding the laws of the country they reside in, and trampling on national sovereignty for over eighty years. Recently, Mr. Lu Lianqiao, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was returning home from work on August 7th, passing through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shijian Road, when he was struck by an automobile number 11578 driven by American citizen Hays speeding from the west without sounding the horn. Mr. Hays should have braked and taken the injured person to the hospital for treatment, but instead, he sped away. Mr. Lu was seriously injured, his head and face bleeding profusely, and he immediately lost consciousness. Patrol officers number 542 and road patrol officer number 348 arrived, recorded the license plate number of the car that caused the accident, and sent him to Renji Hospital. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died on August 11th. Although the court ordered Hays to compensate, Hays claimed the court had no jurisdiction, refused to admit fault, and disobeyed the order, treating human life as child's play. Tracing the origin of the disaster, it is rooted in the unequal treaties. From now on, we are willing to use our greatest determination to support the National Government's diplomacy and carry out the movement to abolish unequal treaties. In addition to petitioning the Municipal Party Department to forward the case to the Municipal Government to conduct diplomatic negotiations based on reason, aiming to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrator and obtaining compensation, we hope that fellow countrymen from all walks of life will unite in resistance to uphold humanitarianism and protect national law. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Respectfully, The Labor Union of the Commercial Press of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Special District Court Continues Hearing of Wu Suzhong</h3>
<p>Headquarters Witness Appears in Court</p>
<p>Wu Denies Ever Knowing Him</p>
<p>Investigation of the Sandeli House</p>
<p>The Defendant Remains in Custody Pending Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Previously, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, based on a report from an informant, stated that Shishi Xinbao reporter Wu Suzhong was an alias of the communist Hu Yu. Therefore, they sent a letter to the Special District Court requesting assistance in the transfer. Wu was arrested and the court has been opened several times. Wu absolutely denies his name is Hu Yu, and the court ordered his detention pending proof from the Headquarters for further verification, which has been repeatedly reported. It is now known that the case was continued yesterday morning by Judge Xu Jashi in the First Court, with prosecutor Xu Mei also present to perform his duties. In addition to dispatching legal advisor James J. Feng to the court to request the transfer, the Headquarters also sent investigator Wang Bin along with a key witness, Mr. Bao. Bao is a senior official in a certain organization. During his testimony, Judge Xu ordered that all those unrelated to the case be removed from the courtroom. He then questioned Bao, who stated that the defendant's surname is Wu and his name is Yu. Because in the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, Shanghai was still under the jurisdiction of warlords and the Kuomintang could not openly operate. At that time, I was a standing committee member of the 11th branch of the 5th District. The defendant's brother, Wu Guangzi, was a comrade of the 11th branch. The roster of party members of the branch was kept by the organization committee member surnamed Duan, but was unexpectedly seized by Li Baozhang. Li arrested all sixteen people according to the roster on February 22nd. The defendant was originally a member of the Communist Party living at No. 6 Sandeli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, which was the general office of the Relief Association organized by the Communist Party, and served as the accountant of the association. His brother, Guangyu, also lived there. Li Baozhang arrested Guangzi, and the defendant was arrested along with him. I was held in the same room with the sixteen people. Through Guangyu's conversation in prison, I learned that the defendant was a communist. Later, because Li could not find the defendant's name on the roster, he was released on bail. Since then, I have never seen him again, and I have never met his brother Guangyu. Now I do not know whether the defendant has left the Relief Association and the Communist Party. When he was arrested by Li, the defendant changed his surname to Ye and disguised himself. His wife visited him in prison, but she did not recognize him. At that time, I deeply admired him. Later, attorney Ru Baoyi from the police and attorney Zhan questioned Bao. Judge Xu then questioned the defendant, who stated that his surname is Wu and his name is Suzhong, and he has no name Yu. He also has no brothers and has never been arrested. He does not know Mr. Bao, who testified in the middle of the questioning. However, as a news reporter, he has been to many places, and it is unavoidable that there are people who know him but he does not know them. But in the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he was still in his hometown of Suqian. It was not until August or September of that year that he came to Shanghai. He has two brothers, and his brother's name is Shuguang, who is only sixteen years old now. There are six or seven distant cousins, but none of them are named Guangyu. He came to Shanghai to find a job, and he came with Zhang Yunqu. Because Zhang had a brother studying in Shanghai, he planned to ask him for help. Judge Xu ordered him to present evidence to the contrary, and instructed that if he had any questions to ask the witness, he could ask them. The defendant stated that the witness's words were completely unfounded. This is the third interrogation of this case. The officials of the Headquarters have stated each time that they have evidence. Today, Mr. Bao said that he and I were arrested by Li Baozhang. He allowed me, but this is absolutely not the case. I also did not join any party. I have never known about No. 6 Sandeli. Since the witness said that I lived there, the judge should inform the police attorney to immediately summon the landlord of the house to confront him. If they summon him after the court session, they may contact the landlord first. Judge Xu then asked whether he had any evidence to prove that he came to Shanghai in August or September. The defendant stated that he could only investigate his hometown. For example, the village chief Xu Wenle could prove it. He then asked whether there were any acquaintances in Shanghai, and when he started working at the Shishi Xinbao. The defendant replied that he started working at the Shishi Xinbao in August or September of last year, and it was introduced by Mr. Zhang. He knew Mr. Zhang through a pastor who introduced him, but he didn't know if he could still remember the date he came to Shanghai. Judge Xu then asked about the address of his first residence in Shanghai and the addresses he moved to later. The defendant replied that he first lived on Jin Shenfu Road, then moved to Xiaoshadu Maodeli and Laoshenfu Road Xinzhapu Road, etc. However, he either did not remember the house number clearly or did not know the name of the landlord. Afterwards, the witness Bao was questioned about the names and addresses of the other fifteen people arrested besides Bao. Bao said that he would submit the names of the other fifteen people separately to their respective residences. They are all scattered now and cannot be investigated. Jiang Jin, who was the propaganda committee member of the 11th branch at that time, later changed his name to Wang Ming due to the Communist Party, was arrested by the government and sentenced to eight years in prison, and is still in prison. Judge Xu stated that this case still needs to be investigated. In addition to instructing the defendant and his lawyer to present evidence to the contrary, he also ordered the investigator in charge to immediately inquire with the landlord of Sandeli about everything. Attorney Zhan immediately stood up and requested the court to instruct the investigator on the key points to be investigated: (1) Whether there was a Relief Association established in Sandeli in the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China; (2) Whether there was an arrest incident. He also stated that in order to be fair, the Headquarters should send a special member to investigate together with the police, because the police are opposed to this case, which is unavoidable. Police attorney Ru Baoyi expressed opposition, saying that it is not useful for the Headquarters to assist in the investigation. If there is evidence, the police should sympathize; otherwise, it is illegal. Attorney Zhan immediately argued that if this case is illegal, then there are many illegal actions by the concession authorities, such as building roads beyond the boundary and Xie Huiyuan being sentenced to imprisonment by the Court of Appeal and released by the American Consul General. Is this legal? Moreover, the designated investigation location belongs to the Chinese territory. The Headquarters is the highest military authority, and the Public Security Bureau should be under its command. Why should the assistance of the Headquarters not be needed? Judge Xu instructed the police investigator on several key points of investigation, ordering him to investigate and report immediately. He will continue the trial after the case is presented, and the defendant will remain in custody pending rescheduling.</p>
<h3>The Daughter-in-Law of Patrolman Li Qingfu Died Unjustly</h3>
<p>Autopsy Conducted Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Determined to Have Been Strangled</p>
<p>Li's Wife Still Claims Suicide</p>
<p>The Police Will File a Public Prosecution</p>
<p>After Li Zhangshi, the eldest daughter-in-law of Anhui native Li Qingfu, patrolman number 615 of the Gordon Road Police Station, suddenly died, it was rumored that she was murdered by her family. The police station arrested Li and his wife, Chen, along with their two sons, Yulong and Yukun, and sent them to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention pending an autopsy, as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the police sent detectives to inform the Zhabei Police Station the day before yesterday, and then transported Li Zhangshi's coffin from the Yangchow Association to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, they summoned all the witnesses to the office. At noon, the Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Huai-pu to lead the forensic doctor to the office. They ordered the workers to open the coffin and saw Li Zhangshi's body lying face up in the coffin, surrounded by lime and straw paper, with her face black as if it had been burned. However, the other limbs were also slightly decayed. The onlookers had differing opinions, with some saying that the body definitely did not die of illness, because the face of a person who died of illness would not be black. Then the forensic doctor began the examination. After detailed observation, he found wounds on her neck and arms, but because the body had been in the coffin for several days, it was difficult to determine. Then the forensic doctor saw that the corpse's mouth was open and the teeth were exposed. He used pliers to pull out a tooth and found obvious wounds on the root of the tooth. It was determined that the neck was a rope mark, and it was very deep. He reported his findings to Prosecutor Guo and determined that the death was not due to cholera. Mr. Guo then took a seat and questioned the witness, Mrs. Pan Wu, who claimed to be a tailor and a neighbor of the Li family. On the night of the 27th, the deceased was scolded by her mother-in-law, and the neighbors could hear the sound of cursing. Later, she heard that the deceased had committed suicide. Wu Genfa, a worker from the Zhang Wansheng Coffin Shop on Datong Road, Zhabei, testified that he went to the Li family to dress the deceased and put her in the coffin, and his statement was similar to what was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Then the deceased's mother-in-law, Li Chen, was questioned. Because the coffin had been opened and the body had been examined, there was nothing to hide. She confessed that her daughter-in-law had hanged herself. She only had a slight quarrel with her, but her daughter-in-law was narrow-minded and could not bear it, so she committed suicide. When she found out, she rushed to rescue her and untied the rope. She still had a breath of air, but there was no way to save her. Later, her husband and son returned home, and her daughter-in-law died. She was afraid of being condemned, so she falsely claimed that her daughter-in-law died of acute cholera. Therefore, her husband and son did not know the truth at first. She explained to her husband and son after the interrogation yesterday. According to Li Qingfu and his three sons, they did not know that Zhang had hanged herself. When the incident happened, they were not at home. When they returned, they were told by Chen that their daughter-in-law had died of cholera. It was not until after the interrogation yesterday that they were informed by Chen. Prosecutor Guo then asked the forensic doctor whether the deceased had died by hanging. The forensic doctor said that the injuries were not consistent with suicide, but with strangulation. The wound on the root of the tooth was caused by yelling loudly when being strangled, and being punched, injuring the mouth or forcibly covering the mouth. After the examination and interrogation, Prosecutor Guo instructed the police to keep the body and coffin in the original place. Li Qingfu and his wife and sons were still detained separately. It is known that the police will file a public prosecution against Li and others, since the body was found to have been strangled, in order to uphold the law.</p>

<h3>Another Key Suspect Arrested in Tianjin in the 100,000 Yuan Robbery Case</h3>
<p>The Police Have Sent Detectives to Transfer Him</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that in the case of the robbery of 100,000 yuan of public funds from the Zhejiang Local Bank on North Henan Road, another person has been arrested in Tianjin and will be escorted to Shanghai soon. Since the day of the incident, after the arrest of seven people, they immediately confessed to the principal offender and two accomplices, who had left Shanghai for Tianjin with most of the stolen money. Therefore, the General Police Station immediately sent a wireless telegraph to all ships and the Tianjin police authorities, requesting them to pay attention to the arrest. Yesterday, the police received a telegram from Tianjin stating that at least one person had been arrested on the day of arrival in Tianjin. Therefore, a Western detective and a Chinese detective were sent to Tianjin today to transfer him back to Shanghai for trial.

<h3>Cai Yunhai, Who Escaped, Surrenders Himself</h3>
<p>Cai Yunhai, the owner of the Cai Chen Company on Bo Wu Yuan Road, Lujing Road, was detained in the Civil Custody Center by the Special District Court for failing to fulfill a contract for goods. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, he escaped by digging a hole in the window at 3:00 AM the day before yesterday during a torrential rain. It is now known that after Cai escaped, he immediately submitted the goods to the court in full. He then heard people say that escaping requires a charge of escaping, so he deeply regretted it. Therefore, at 3:00 PM that afternoon, he went to the detention center with his lawyer Wei Wenhan to surrender himself. After the warden Xie inquired about the circumstances of the escape, he immediately prepared a document to send to the Special District Court for investigation. Because he was eager to settle the civil matter and surrendered himself afterward, the circumstances are excusable, and the court ordered him to be released on bail pending trial.</p>
<h3>Mei Fei Case Adjourned</h3>

Yesterday morning, Judge Sun of the Special District Court held another hearing. The second defendant, Hu Yongquan, has fled without a trace and has not yet been arrested. The plaintiff's lawyer, Kui Qi, stated that since Hu is not present, the case cannot proceed, and requested another adjournment. Judge Sun then ordered Mei Fei to pay 1,000 yuan bail and adjourned the hearing for fourteen days.</p>
<h3>Ye Deming Accuses His Biological Mother of Obstructing His Physical Freedom</h3>
<p>Listened to His Uncle's Instigation</p>
<p>Sent Him to the Xiqin Institute</p>
<p>Ye Deming, a patient recently sent from the Caoging Youmin Xiqin Institute to the disease room No. 1 of the Xin Puyu Hall in the South City, claimed that his biological mother had listened to slander and transferred him to the Youmin Xiqin Institute. Since he had not violated the law, it must have been at the instigation of those who coveted his property. However, he did not want to talk about his mother's fault. Now, because his life is in extreme danger, he has hired lawyer Zhu Xiyun to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court. The original statement is recorded below: For coveting inheritance, instigating obstruction of freedom, requesting provisional disposition and ordering release: The defendant (i.e., biological mother Ye Tao) is the plaintiff's relative. Because of listening to the slander of his uncle Tao Miaogan and others (i.e., those who coveted the property), in March of this year, the plaintiff was sent to the Songhu Jiaoyang Institute on Song Gongyuan Road, Zhabei, by means of kidnapping, and detained for more than a month. The defendant, trusting local bully Jin Pinzhou (i.e., Yu Song), also sold the Tongtaixing Wool Shop on Xingsheng Street, French Concession outside the Xinbei Gate, which was left by the plaintiff's late father, for 12,000 yuan (the shop is worth more than 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and the manager has not handed over the account books to this day). The plaintiff was also taken to the Baker Law Firm on Zhubaoshan Road to be coerced into signing the document, falsely claiming that he would be released if he signed it; otherwise, he would be detained forever. The plaintiff had no choice but to fulfill their wishes. Unexpectedly, after his uncles and others obtained the plaintiff's signature, they wanted to dispose of the property, so they still kept the plaintiff under house arrest and threatened him in every possible way. On the 8th of this month, they sent the plaintiff to the Caoging Youmin Xiqin Institute and agreed to detain him for six months before discussing a solution. Now, because the plaintiff is ill, he has been sent to the Xin Puyu Hall for treatment. Recently, he heard that his uncles and others had changed their plan and intended to design to harm the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff's life is in extreme danger. The plaintiff has no hobbies, does not waste money, and has not been declared incompetent or sentenced to imprisonment by the court. Now the defendant is obstructing the plaintiff's physical freedom, which is illegal. His uncles and others have a conspiracy to harm the plaintiff's life, so it will be difficult to execute the final judgment. Therefore, he requests a provisional disposition and requests the court to rule yesterday, notify the Caoging Youmin Xiqin Institute, and inform the Xin Puyu Hall to release the plaintiff first, and order the defendants not to obstruct the plaintiff's physical freedom in the future.</p>
<p>It is said that the case has been scheduled to be heard today.</p>
<h3>Embezzled Money from Subsidiary Accounts and Fled to Suzhou to Live a Lavish Life</h3>
<p>Exposed Because of Inspection</p>
<p>Shen Yunli, an apprentice at the Qinchang Iron Factory in Hongkou, is 18 years old and a native of Suzhou. He entered Qinchang two years ago and has been diligent in his studies. The owner appreciates him very much. This summer, he was promoted to deputy accountant. Unexpectedly, Shen suddenly stole two bank drafts at the end of last month and exchanged them for 800 yuan in cash, and his whereabouts are unknown. The owner is now demanding compensation from his family and guarantors. Shen took the money and took a car to Suzhou on the same day, staying in room 51 of the Xinchang Inn outside the Changmen Gate. He went out to play every day, spending his money lavishly. He had already spent 40% of the money he had. The other night, the police station sent a police chief to inspect the passengers. Because Shen's behavior was suspicious, they asked him about his background and what he was doing in Suzhou. Shen was evasive, so they searched him and found 500 yuan in cash. They took Shen to the detective team and questioned him about the theft. Therefore, they sent a letter to the iron factory and informed his father, who had gone to Suzhou to request to bring him back to Shanghai for investigation.</p>
<h3>Trafficking Case Cracked on Xiamen Liner</h3>
<p>The Trafficker Dared to Offer a Bribe of Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Lin Yongfang and Chen Shaoting, investigators from the Women and Children Relief Association, went to the Xiamen liner Taiyuan, which was docked at the Swire Wharf in the French Concession, at 5:00 AM yesterday morning to investigate whether there were traffickers luring women and children to export. They saw a middle-aged man in the steerage cabin carrying a pockmarked girl about 13 or 14 years old, looking around suspiciously. The man claimed that the girl was his biological daughter, but the woman claimed that the man was her stepfather. Because their statements were inconsistent, the two were detained. Not long after, another man brought a girl about 16 or 17 years old onto the ship. It was observed that the man's eyes were agile and he was paying attention to the behavior of others. The investigators also questioned him. Unexpectedly, the man took out a ten yuan banknote, intending to bribe them. The investigators were even more suspicious. After repeated questioning, they learned that it was a trafficking case. Therefore, they took the two men and two women, along with the man and woman they had previously seized, to the Water Police Station for questioning. According to the initial interrogation of the man and woman, the man's name is Tang Jiangsheng, 35 years old, from Jiangwan. The woman's name is Tang Asan, 13 years old, from Jiangwan. Her mother runs a brothel. Tang is her stepfather. Now the brothel is closed, and I was taken to Xiamen to sell myself as a prostitute. According to the subsequent interrogation of the man and woman, the man's name is Hong Ating, 28 years old, from Ningbo. The woman's name is Rong Adi, 17 years old, from Taishan. I was also taken to Xiamen to sell myself into prostitution. The police chief said that these people are trafficking decent women to export and sell them into prostitution for profit, which is inhumane. Now that the case has been solved, they dare to boldly offer bribes and disregard the law. He ordered detective Cheng Yongnian to transfer the two criminals to the District Court for interrogation. The two women were also taken to the court to find a way to rescue them, so as not to fall into the fire pit.</p>

<h3>The Number of Dead Insect Egg Purchases is Alarming</h3>
<p>Expenditure of 800 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>More Than 100,000 Pieces of Dead Insect Eggs</p>
<p>The Municipal Agricultural Experiment Station was ordered to purchase dead insect eggs to enrich the people's food. According to the report from the station to the Municipal Government yesterday, it purchased more than 160,000 pieces of dead insect eggs and more than 10,000 dead moths in the Yinhang, Jiangwan, and Caoging districts, spending more than 800 silver dollars. Each piece of insect egg can damage more than 100 rice plants if it becomes an insect. Although the cost of purchasing dead insect eggs last time was huge, the increase in production was considerable. It is now the breeding season for the three-spotted rice borer. The funds for this purchase are limited, and the reproduction of dead insect eggs is infinite, making it difficult to continue to cope. Starting today, the purchase will be reduced. It is now being sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for storage, and it is planned to select a date to submit a request to send personnel and invite the municipal committee members of each district to supervise the burning in order to encourage and promote the propaganda.</p>

The Taikang Rice Shop reported it to the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. The detective Su Sheng arrested Dai Asan, learned the truth, and then Director Yuan prepared an official letter and sent Su Sheng with Dai He San to the Jiading County Public Office, requesting that the owner of the Qiaxinghe shop, who received the stolen goods, be arrested, but he was not found. Only the shop partner Jiang Boqing was brought to the Jiading County Public Office and transferred to Shanghai for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Maltreatment of Child Brides</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an instruction from the Civil Affairs Department yesterday, stating that in order to comply with the order, it had received Instruction No. 518 from the Provincial Government, stating that it had approved the Jiangnan Provincial Party Consolidation Committee's presentation that the practice of parents-in-law mistreating child brides in various counties had not decreased compared with the autocratic era, which was inhuman and infringed on freedom. It was the duty of the committee to appeal against this matter. The second and third committee meetings resolved to present the matter to the Provincial Party Consolidation Committee, requesting the Provincial Government to forward it to the various county governments to strictly prohibit the practice. The matter should be recorded and submitted to the meeting for approval. You are requested to check and forward the instruction for implementation, which would be a great convenience. In addition to instructing the various departments, the relevant matters should be checked and forwarded for implementation. This order states that the maltreatment of child brides is indeed inhuman and should be strictly prohibited. It is appropriate to order the departments to notify their subordinates to comply and publicize it to all so as to eliminate evil practices and uphold humanity. This order.</p>
<h3>Secretly Selling Gambling Vouchers and Being Detained</h3>
<p>Recently, the gambling trend of flower clubs has been rampant in the Hongkou area. The general organization of the flower clubs has more than three rabbit warrens, so although the police have sent detectives to investigate, countless women with whimsical ideas have suffered. At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a boat owner from Guangdong, Bai Jin, was secretly selling flower club gambling vouchers to residents in the North Jiangxi Road area. He was discovered by Chinese patrolman number 1858 and was immediately arrested. Gambling vouchers and gambling money were found on his body and taken to the Hongkou Police Station.

<h3>Abuse of Apprentice Actors</h3>
<p>Bloodstains clearly visible on arms and legs</p>
<p>Already handed over to the District Court for investigation</p>
<p>A small teahouse in the market town of Caojiadu, Shanghai West, houses a Yangzhou opera troupe. They perform daily, and business is reasonably sufficient. One of the actors in the troupe, named Dai Lanfang, is 26 years old, from Yangzhou, and currently resides at No. 22, Xin Gongyi Lane in the town. At the beginning of last month, Zhu Yulong, who lived at No. 51, Xin Sen Lane, introduced Ding Li's son, Ding Heyao (11 years old, from Dantu), to Dai as an apprentice to learn singing. After Dai accepted Ding, the boy resided with Dai. However, for a month now, not only has he not been taught, but he has also been subjected to extreme abuse. Dai is also naturally tyrannical. If anything displeases him, he immediately resorts to beatings. This was known by the apprentice's friends, who repeatedly asked Zhu to negotiate with Dai, but Dai ignored them completely. One afternoon, around 8 o'clock, the apprentice dozed off. Dai saw this and first scolded him loudly, then beat him severely with a stick, striking him all over. The apprentice, in extreme pain, fell to the ground and cried out for help. Fortunately, neighbors saw this and, unable to bear it, immediately informed his father, who in turn asked the introducer, Zhu Yulong, to rush over. Zhu saw that Ding had already suffered several injuries, with blood clearly visible on his arms and legs. Zhu then called the police, who took Dai and Ding to the Sixth District Police Station. After interrogation by the District Chief, the case was deemed to involve an actor abusing and injuring an apprentice, a violation of ethical conduct. Yesterday, a document was prepared and he was handed over to the District Court for investigation.</p>

Yesterday morning, the French police criminal investigation department sent detectives to investigate. There were no family members present. Peng Hangen, a colleague of the deceased, was brought in for questioning. The coroner of the French Court, Judge Zhu, arrived and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from poisoning. After questioning Peng Hangen, Judge Zhu ordered photographs to be taken and the workshop owner to prepare a coffin for burial. Subsequently, Wenyuanzhai provided funds for a simple coffin and the body was temporarily placed in the graveyard, awaiting identification by family members.</p>

It was too late and he died at 6:45 p.m. that evening. The hospital reported to the Fourth Ma Road Police Station, who sent detectives to his home to summon his mother and wife to the scene to claim the body and prepare for burial. The deceased was indeed in dire straits, a truly pitiful situation.</p>

<h3>First Selling the Child, Then Themselves</h3>
<p>Result of a Young Woman Being Lured to Shanghai</p>
<p>Chen Tingfang, a young woman from Nantong, only 19 years old, married Wang Qingzhang, a farmer from her hometown. Unable to endure hard labor, she was seduced by Wang Yiting and brought to Shanghai. However, in the extravagant city of Shanghai, the money was quickly spent. They sold her seven-month-old child for six yuan. However, this small amount was not enough to last three days. She was then sold to Lin Yuguang, a dockworker at the Jiangbian pier, as his wife, with an agreed price of sixty yuan, half of which was paid in advance. The other day, Wang went to collect the remaining payment. The woman accused him at the Gaochang Temple police station, who sent them to the Second District and then to the court. During the investigation, Wang confessed that the child had been sold to Yang Yuchun, commander of the Wusong Fortress Command. The District Court prosecutor then dispatched police officers Zou Zhendong and Hu Xianglin to bring Yang and the child before the court. The child was detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Woman Dies After Divorce</h3>
<p>Her Father Sues Her Ex-Husband to Recover Dowry</p>
<p>Zhu Genfu, a farmer from the 72nd Tu, 19th Bao, in the Nanhui County jurisdiction, previously sued his wife, Zhu Yu, at the county government for disobeying and verbally abusing her mother-in-law and other elders, requesting a divorce. As a result, the divorce was granted, and the dowry was ordered to be returned to Zhu Yu. However, before the lawsuit was concluded, Zhu Yu died of illness. Now, Zhu Yu's father, Yu Shukui, filed a lawsuit with the Nanhui County government against his former son-in-law, Zhu Genfu, demanding the return of the dowry (valued at over 900 yuan). After the hearing, Yu Shukui lost the case. Yu, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the District Court, requesting the return of his daughter Yu Xiaomei's (i.e., Zhu Yu's) dowry. The appellee, Zhu Genfu, hired lawyer Xu Xingti to file a response. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the Eighth Court to hear the case. According to the appellant Yu Shukui, after my daughter's divorce, all her clothing remained in her former husband's house. Now that my daughter is dead, her clothing should be returned, and I demand its return. The appellee, Zhu Genfu, testified that he is 24 years old and lives by farming. Yu Shukui is my father-in-law. The judge asked if all the clothing had been returned. He replied that all of it had been taken back by Yu. Asked when they were married, he replied that they were married twelve years ago, cohabited for one year, and on June 18 of the thirteenth year, Yu took her belongings back to her mother's home, as witnessed by neighbors. On August 19 of the same year, his father-in-law and others came to his house and took away all the dowry. This time, his father-in-law sued him for 900 yuan of dowry in the Nanhui County government, and the judgment was dismissed. Now he is appealing without any evidence. The judge asked about the divorce lawsuit, and asked who wanted the divorce. He replied that it was because she disobeyed and beat my mother, so I sued for divorce. The judge tried to mediate the case in court, ordering Zhu Genfu to pay Yu Shukui 50 yuan as a settlement. Yu Shukui firmly refused, demanding that all items listed on the attached list be returned in full. At this point, lawyer Xu made a statement. The judge, considering that the case still required evidence, ordered both parties to withdraw and wait for a continued hearing on a later date.</p>
<h3>Woman Crushed to Death by Bus in Wusong</h3>
<p>The Songyang Public Bus Company of Wusong City, which operates between Wusong and Yanggang, has a reasonably good business. At 4:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, Bus No. 6 (City Government No. 4143) of the company, carrying seven or eight passengers, arrived at Shanguantang from Baoshan. As the gasoline was used up, it was about to enter the station to refuel, so the passengers were asked to get off temporarily. Among them was a woman about 26 years old, who went to the field to buy several stalks of sorghum and ate them on the ground. Unexpectedly, the bus driver, Zhang Changfu (Ningbo native, 22 years old), accidentally ran over the woman's head and abdomen while reversing the car.

The seventh district police station then detained the perpetrator, Zhang Changfu, and sent him to the judicial department for investigation. It is said that the deceased was the wife of a certain member of the Wusong Security Corps. Upon hearing the news, he rushed to collect the body.</p>

<p>Please Send to Reform School or Vocational Training Center</p>
<p>The Shanghai Human-Powered Cart Association reported that car thieves Chen Weilong, Xu San, Li Er, and others had been apprehended by the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team.

Recently, in addition to running the new pharmaceutical business, Mr. Huang also pays attention to promoting traditional Chinese medicine. He has built a four-story洋房 in Zhongshi, Zhejiang Road in this city to organize a large-scale Chinese pharmacy called Huang Jiuzhitang. He has also set up a膠 factory outside Qiantangmen on the West Lake in Hangzhou to draw lake water and refine tiger, deer, turtle, and other kinds of膠. He also piously prepares all kinds of family-transmitted experience and secret recipes to openly benefit the world. As for the various decoctions, pills, powders, ointments, elixirs, floral dew, oils, and wines sold on the market, everything is available. He also plans to offer preferential treatment to customers. In addition to the usual 15th and 1st and 15th of the national calendar, he will also offer a 10% discount every Sunday, a total of eight days of discount per month to attract customers. He also plans to publish the Huang Jiuzhitang Pills, Powders, Ointments, and Elixirs General Record book and distribute it to all sectors. It is said to be in print. The preparation of the pharmacy has been going on for nearly a year, and recently, all items have been ready. It is said that he will choose a lucky date this month to open it. A special record of its outline is to celebrate the star of the medical and pharmaceutical world.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Does Not Allow Commercial Operation of Long Ferries</h3>
<p>The ferrymen of the Lan Ni Du ferry were concerned that the Public Security Bureau's plan to take back the ferry and operate it officially would affect their livelihoods. They recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, appealing for the reversal of the decision. A reporter from Huadong News Agency specially visited a certain gentleman in the Secretariat of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau yesterday. He said that the ferrymen's petition had been received. However, this plan was entirely decided by the Municipal Affairs Conference. This time, the bureau's active progress was also due to the urging of the municipal government. However, the municipal government's eagerness to take back the official operation was purely for the sake of rectifying the long ferry crossings. The corruption of the eight long ferry crossings in the Huangpu River has reached its extreme. This undertaking concerns the lives of tens of thousands of travelers in the future. If it is not rectified, it will be difficult to fulfill the responsibilities of the municipal government to transform the city. Moreover, the Public Utilities Bureau's predetermined plan has also taken into consideration the livelihoods of the ferrymen after the official operation. The ferry business originally belongs to the city. The ferrymen mistakenly believe that it is a hereditary business, which is a mistake. Therefore, this time, the Public Utilities Bureau has rejected the request and will not allow it. It also said that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is also raising bidding on all construction and other items for the recovery of the Lan Ni Du ferry. It has been completed and is now starting to proceed. It is expected to be completed in February and March next year. As for the ferries built, they are also extremely complete, which is vastly different from the existing ferry operations. And the safety of passengers can also be absolutely guaranteed.</p>

This product was launched yesterday. In order to promote domestic famous brands, each pharmacy has set up display windows to display it uniformly. In addition to our company's advertisements in major newspapers and famous cinemas, we have also obtained the consent of the Great World to hold a propaganda conference on the roof of the Great World. From inside the Great World gate, all theaters, public places, and even the roof are filled with Buliduo advertisements, such as lions, lanterns, and all kinds of technical decorations, either displayed, hung, or pasted, everywhere you look. The giant lion on the roof is majestically perched, with each of its claws being more than three feet long, making it incomparably grand. In front of it is a Buliduo display, with the bottle tilted and pouring continuously, which is enough to make onlookers guess and be surprised.

<h3>Thousands of Unemployed People in New York are Trapped in Hunger</h3>
<p>The number of job seekers is as high as more than 20,000. Female workers are willing to do any heavy work.</p>
<p>New York News: The Mayor of New York City, in order to alleviate the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people, has now opened a free job center. The number of job seekers is increasing daily. As of August 20, 15,000 people requested in writing, and 8,000 people contacted the center in person. Most of these job seekers have been unemployed for several months and are trapped in hunger and mental weakness. Thousands of people lined up and gathered silently. Even the police who were sent to maintain order felt bored. Among the 8,000 job seekers, 10% were women. They were willing to accept any low wages and heavy work. Among the 15,000 people who requested in writing, 648 people found jobs. Most of the people who found jobs worked for families for salaries of 30 to 40 yuan (including meals).</p>
<h3>Japan's Gold Outflow is Approximately 200 Million</h3>
<p>The Yokohama Specie Bank prepares to reduce its reserves.</p>
<p>According to Japanese news, since Japan lifted the gold embargo, a large amount of gold has flowed out. The total outflow in the second half of the year is not only the total amount of gold exported, which has reached 242,600,000 yuan, resulting in a reduction in the gold reserves of the Bank of Japan. On the other hand, the total amount of gold bullion flowing in from China's Northeast, Siberia via the Bank of Korea, the gold materials flowing in from Shanghai via the Mitsubishi Bank, and the gold bullion purchased by other gold producers reached 43,700,000 yuan. After offsetting each other, the amount of gold reserves is approximately 198,900,000 yuan less.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Imperial Household Agency Photocopies Rare Chinese Books</h3>

<h3>China's Raw Silk Exports Greatly Increase During the New Silk Season</h3>
<p>The Shanghai port has been relatively idle recently.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the silk industry, Chinese silk exports have greatly increased due to the benefits of cheap silver. From the beginning of the new silk season this year, from February to the end of July (Shanghai silk from June 1st to July 22nd, Guangdong silk from May 1st to the end of July), the total number of Chinese silk exports was 35,868 bales, an increase of 1,179 bales compared to last year. The most noteworthy point is that exports to Europe decreased by 2,057 bales, while exports to the United States increased by 3,146 bales, which is enough to offset the decrease in exports to Europe. This is solely due to the sluggishness of the French silk weaving industry. However, the export of Shanghai raw silk has recently become sluggish and there have not been many transactions. The reason is that the rise in silver prices and the increase in exchange rates since the end of last month have affected it.</p>

<h3>The Epidemic in Universities</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>An epidemic can also be said to be a fashion trend. People who suffer from such a disease not only do not feel pain, but may even boast about being fashionable.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can now observe such a phenomenon in any university in Shanghai: writing love letters, watching movies, chatting idly, and strolling down the street.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be said that no matter whose dormitory you go to, you will always find very beautiful envelopes in his or her paper letter holder pinned to the wall. The envelopes are written in elegant penmanship, and the signature is either an English abbreviation or simply left blank. Similar letters with a mysterious color can also be found in large numbers at the gatehouse when the postman delivers them. Haha, if you open them one by one and appreciate them, it will really make you dizzy.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday are usually rest days, but university students who do not feel tired on weekdays, of course, do not need this kind of healthy moaning. Therefore, these two days have become their big gathering for watching movies. Lovers naturally come to the seductive cinema hand in hand, quietly indulging themselves. Those who have not found a partner can only lower their standards and invite a few friends of the same sex to appreciate the ardent love and intoxicating dance on the screen. When they come back or are about to sleep, they must start a fierce review of the movies.</p>
<p>Attending classes is, of course, absolutely free. Even in the lecture hall, their ears do not necessarily have to listen to the lecture. If they encounter a good professor, they will naturally pay more attention. If it is a boring one, the students will be impolite and start talking. The quiet ones are still talking and laughing softly, while the naughty ones simply open their throats and speak loudly. During self-study time, except for a few who are really studying, almost everyone is answering and laughing, talking about a certain classmate's family, or someone's love affair, or the cold or warm weather, or the quality of clothes, or the scenery there, or someone's appearance. It's all this kind of aimless talk. Although sometimes they will talk passionately and indignantly about social and national issues, or fierce arguments will occur due to disagreements on the main points—but wasting precious time on empty talk probably still cannot get rid of our unique national character of only talking and not doing.</p>
<p>After dinner, some students like to go for a walk on the street in groups of three or five. While chatting, their eyes keep scanning the people passing by on the left, right, front, and back, or unconsciously looking at the displays in the glass cabinets along the street. If a fashionable woman suddenly appears diagonally, ah, their eyeballs will seem to be sucked by calcium carbide, and they will never turn again. They must wait until her shadow completely disappears before they smile at each other, and finally add a few criticisms.</p>
<p>Of course, a dull and monotonous life cannot satisfy passionate young people—but, I think that at least when pursuing interests, we should think back to the future of our nation. Does it need this kind of anesthetizing adjustment? At the same time, we must deeply reflect on whether our current international position allows you to live in a muddle-headed way.</p>
<p>Here, I have an important thing to say, that is, under the current environment, we young people, especially the college students who are intellectuals, bear the great mission of promoting the nation and transforming society. What we need is not fun, but diligence and hard work, forging a firm spirit and a healthy body, preparing to shoulder heavy responsibilities in the future.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Women</h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>We, who are accustomed to living in the Jiangnan area with its beautiful mountains and clear waters, when we hear someone mention the word Mongolia, will immediately think of those vast and uninhabited wildernesses, the weather with flying sand and rocks, and the bitter cold scenes of snow-covered ground, and regard it as an uncivilized land that is not suitable for living in for a day. However, in the eyes of those who have been there, it does not seem so annoying, and perhaps there is a special charm worth remembering.</p>
<p>I went to Outer Mongolia in mid-August of the sixteenth year. The purpose was to investigate antiquities, but whenever I had free time from digging bones and pulling sand, I often paid attention to the actions of these so-called "Northern Rouge," as well as their joys, sorrows, customs, and habits. There are still some noteworthy places. Now, while this impression has not yet faded, I will write down a little bit for reference.</p>
<p>Preconceived notions limit our vision. We often think that only the Jiangnan area produces beauties. We don't know that among the women in the distant yurts, there are many "Northern Rouge" who surpass the "Southern Dynasties Jinpowder." Some of them have high noses like hanging gallbladders, paired with long eyes and large oval faces. The facial features are neat and reveal a refreshing and elegant spirit. They are tall and strong. From the perspective of evolutionary aesthetics, these are the unique advantages of Mongolian women, which our Jiangnan women lack. Every time I see their girls, wearing long jujube-red satin robes and a face that has not been injured by lead powder, walking towards me gracefully, it is as if a beautiful flower is blooming in the deserted desert where no one appreciates it. I am amazed at the impartiality of creation. Its gifts are not stingy due to the separation of mountains and passes. It is a pity that it is different after they become women. The scarlet red of rouge is applied to the skin, causing it to wrinkle, and the lead in the white powder turns the face yellow. Moreover, the hair bun on top of the head is not often combed, so that from a distance, it looks like a bird's nest. They are all very hardworking. All daily chores, such as picking up manure, milking cows, setting up tents, sewing clothes, and planting crops, are borne by them. The men do nothing all day long, just holding a dry pipe and sitting high talking or chasing livestock. Although they treat women, it is common to beat their wives with whips for no reason. They believe that a husband beating her is proof that he loves her. If a bride has not tasted the taste of a whip once in the past year, then she is an unfortunate person who is not loved. There was a Shanxi man who did business in Kulun who married a Mongolian girl. The girl's family was very well-off, but the dowry she brought to her daughter only included a fox fur coat and two pairs of cotton pants. The husband did not mind this and still loved his wife with the love of a Han man. However, she always felt depressed and unhappy, and others did not know why, or thought that her temperament did not match his. A nosy person used some method to anger her husband, so that he beat her after getting drunk. The next day, she held sharp scissors and tore apart the layers of cotton pants she was wearing. From the densely sewn cotton wool, she took out twenty silver dollars and presented them to her husband as an expression of her love for him. It was then that she knew that the dowry in these two pairs of cotton pants was quite a lot. The girl also boasted to others that her husband now liked her. This kind of situation... as long as you have lived in Mongolia for more than a month, you will know that I have not lied here. However, there are quite a few exceptions. The old women among them are also extremely fierce. According to custom, the northwest corner of the yurt is the place where ghosts and gods reside and is forbidden to people. If someone does not know and rashly sits in this sacred northwest corner, they will be politely pushed out, otherwise they will only be filled with old fists. Once, I was careless and violated the rules. The men were about to pull me. I had no choice and wanted to explain, but those men suddenly stopped and lowered their heads, as if waiting for punishment. I was confused instead. Suddenly an old lady with wrinkled face appeared at the door of the tent. She pointed at those people. As far as I could hear, it meant something like this:</p>
<p>"Without my order... she is a Han, dare you move a finger?"</p>
<p>Until I walked out of the tent in trepidation, their heads had not yet been raised. Presumably, this old woman is the head of the family. The dignity of women is old and eternal, and it is not inferior to the Han.</p>
<p>I really don't know where they get the strength to do so many things. Every time I see them dismantling yurts, loading cars, carrying odds and ends on their backs, and following the cars, walking seventy or eighty miles. After arriving at a place with water and grass, they have to set up tents, take care of children, and even bury pots to cook. Fortunately, their cooking is simple. Ordinary families always boil a pot of millet porridge first. When it's ready, they cut up some beef and mutton, throw it into the pot, and roll it slightly. Then they take it out and put it in a bowl. Fresh blood oozes from the meat slices into the bowl. This is what they think is the most delicious food. At this time, a group of men leave their cushions, put down their dry pipes, and eat these good things, never because the women are too busy and share a little of their hard work. Even so, they also have a little rest and happiness, which is the New Year and other festivals. Women in the village, except for the elderly, all wear red and green clothes, wearing satin hats adorned with pearls and jade, gathered in designated temples or yurts. Everyone dances and sings, from seven or eight people to twenty or thirty people. They hold hands in a circle, advancing and retreating, and there are certain rules. The singing sound is exactly resounding in the clouds. It is a pity that we do not understand what they are singing. Otherwise, collecting them would be a very good literary material. In addition, if there are distinguished guests, they will also hold family banquets and generally dance and sing, but the number of people is not that many.</p>
<p>Women usually also have their ways of having fun. When they go out to carry manure or milk cows, they always go together. When they have carried enough manure and milked well, they start singing in their spare time. The shepherds who collect sheep also respond to them. It is said that some are very good love songs, but we can't understand them. Otherwise, collecting them would be very good literary material.</p>
<p>Their social interaction seems very free. The boundaries between men and women are not very strict. Divorce is also very easy if the husband and wife do not agree. However, for the first marriage, the man's family must also lead a few sheep to the woman's family as a betrothal gift. The amount of this betrothal gift is not uniform and varies according to the family's circumstances. As for the man's family paying the woman's family a betrothal gift, this is certain. Presumably, these are the etiquette of respecting unmarried daughters. Remarriage is casual, without any formalities. It is enough if both parties agree.</p>
<p>Women can ride horses like men. The distance between their residences is very far. The scattered tents are scattered in the vast plain. Occasionally, when they go out to visit friends, they have to travel dozens of miles at a time. One day, I went to the home of an old lady named Kesh to find her daughter. I didn't find her. She said, "She went to Chuánménr (串門兒, visit relatives), I'll call her."</p>
<p>"How far is it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It's just next door," she said, getting on her horse and leaving. In less than two meals, both mother and daughter returned. I learned that they were playing in a place twenty miles away. I couldn't help but gasp, "The horizon is like a neighbor's house," which can really be sung for them. If I could learn this skill of riding a horse, wouldn't I be happy? It is a pity that I still have to stay away from the little horses. Compared with these healthy women from the north of the desert, the cowardly Han people are really ashamed. It's just that I didn't stay there for long and set off on my return journey, so I couldn't do a systematic study of their lives. I still regret it when I think of it now.</p>
