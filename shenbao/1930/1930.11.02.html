<p>二對一勝金陵</p>
<p>四大學排球錦標賽第一日結果因之江犯規滬江棄權局面漸定金陵本身亦自　有奪標把握　知椿果所得適得其反錦標爲東吳以二與一之比奪行四次錦標東吳連獲其三雖似此次之出於幸運但其實力自足雄視華東也經過如下</p>
<p>第一局金陵勝</p>
<p>昨日天陰但幸未雨觀衆爲迷於球戲興　益見盎然午後之天賜莊道上遂人山人海可見一般人對於勝負之一　那亦頗注意也比二時半公正人李飛雲君鳴角召將由東吳首先發球朱志倫遠射之球即爲金陵應聲而返幸劈下力薄即救出重入敵陣遂開紀錄朱　勝猛襲又連勝二球嗣金陵得發球機會輾輾傳遞隊長余郇子　伏救險伸臂壓陣大顯神通造成五比五之對局因是東吳方面拉拉四起以爲打氣時金陵陣綫甚齊統率有方譚天利一身當關萬夫莫敵此來彼經兩無輕綺似此五比六而至五比九始爲東吳襲去輪至趙從珩發球球出如天壓力甚大金陵至此亦爲驚嘆連得六分反造成十一比九之局而易陣以後金陵襲擊依然聲勢乃驟然扭轉接續得分又佔先着最後忽又以二十對二十之相持生死關頭竟爲金陵逃過第一局金陵以二十二對二十勝然亦險矣</p>
<p>第二局東吳勝</p>
<p>第二局開始金陵以東吳究有淵源不敢輕敵小心翼翼黨獲雄名開球以後東吳拍一落空連獲二分時東吳趙從珩一圖而起連勝四分維以周朝綱梅家詳努力進攻亦勝四球上半局十一對東吳形勢佔優易地之後東吳力得八分而金陵則扭劈無方僅獲六分結果二十一對十二東吳勝</p>
<p>第三局東吳勝</p>
<p>二局旣終不分勝負遂繼續比賽第三局金陵初甚平淡旣爲東吳連得五分陣綫大亂軍心亦己溪散一　不振上半塲東吳以十一對比四佔先易地繼戰東吳巳不再加油然勢巳造成金陵挽回無方余邭子徒然呌屈僅見東吳之青雲直上耳結果二十一比九東吳以二與一之比獲得本届錦標焉</p>

<p>工商會議所擬討論的範圍旣如此这廣則其責任之重大可想而知</p>

<h3 id="c173">研究國曆結賬 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>商整會呈准分期辦法之經過</p>
<p>市商會特組專門委員會審查</p>
<p>擬以立春前一日爲總結賬期</p>
<p>國曆結賬己爲社會最注意之問題因其關係不僅在商界即晋通人民亦均有切身之關係新聲社記者以該項國曆結賬分期辦法原爲前上海特别市商人團體整理委員會議定後呈奉政府核准通令施行而本年各業感覧　難市商會亦己接受研究特組專門委員會審查因特訪市商會秘書嚴諤　君詳述本案經過如下</p>
<p>核議國曆結賬之原函　按照國曆結賬係本市社會局於去年九月九日致函上海特别市商人團體整理委員會核議其原函謂「自明年（即十九年）起每年分期收賬均宜遵照　曆計算或按照節氣前後一年酌分數期務必以廢除陰曆爲目的相應函逹貴會查照即希於上列辦法考察商情參加意見擬具本年（十八年）統結賬日期及明年起收賬分期辦法以備採納懸案以待望速施行」云云是按照社會局原函本有兩種辦法一係分期一係按照節氣其惟一目的則在廢除陰曆遵照國曆</p>
<p>市商整會核議之情形　商整會奉到社會局上函後先經常務委員會詳細研究旋於九月三十日第八次全體會議提出討論議决推行國暦廢除陰暦旣奉國府通令自應一致遵守惟商界陰暦結賬原分爲一年三期而以年終爲大結束如將結賬期數加多則期短氣促實行爲難如將期數减少則經濟流轉困難爲求各方事實便利起見仍以每年分三期結賬爲宜至分期辦法我國以農立國須顧到農民收穫時期查國暦五月終爲蠶絲及大麥登場之期九月爲稻熟之期如以五月末日及九月末日爲商界結賬日期在實行上尚少阻碍仍以國暦十二月末日爲大結束之期等語議决後先推王延松貝淞蓀秦潤卿三委員與社會局接洽認爲可行後始於十月四日正式函復社會局</p>
<p>核議時之各方面意見　當商整會核議本案時整委中雖有主張另定商暦者然大多數委員則以奉行國暦旣具决心不當先有顧慮應毅然决定後第一届時在事實上確難通行則政府亦可明瞭實非商人苟安成性　於改革之故或可另定變通辦法其時南京市社會局亦曾函徵南京總商會對於十九年起按照國暦結賬辦法京商會討論結果以國暦五月八月年終三個時期爲結賬期認爲滿意函復京市社會局呈京市府轉呈國府備案滬市商整會以京滬商會意見對於國暦年終總結賬期旣屬一致遂有此項三期辦法之决定</p>
<p>國府核准通令之經過　滬市社會局據商整會函復後即呈市府市府以所擬改革結賬日期辦法尚屬周詳據倩呈請行政院又經行政院飭交工商部核復嗣據工商部復稱核與中央法令商事習慣尚無不合之處似可照准所擬辦法俾全國結賬日期得以劃一而廢止舊暦亦根本解决等語呈復行政院行政院復核無異一面轉呈國府鑒核備案暨請通令全國一體遵行外一面令由滬市府轉令社會局函復商整會函中有「惟自十九年份起即應絶對遵照所擬分期辦法辦理結賬」之語同時復由市黨部暨特區臨時法院轉行到會即經由商整會分函通吿各同業公會並登報公吿以期周知嗣後各地商會有來函詢問者商整會亦即隨時錄令函復</p>
<p>本年國曆結賬之推進　自市商會正式成立以後對於國暦結賬一案奉行甚力於未到五月底九月底結賬之期即先行登報公吿使全市商家届時遵辦即錢業煤業綢業等各公會亦均期登報通吿使同業注意遵行市商會並於五月九月兩末日停止辦公一天以引起商家之注意九月底旣過錢業公會以國暦年終總結束轉瞬即届即登報公吿希望各業預行準備市商會亦經第四次執行委員會議决於本市各報刋登公吿一面通函全市各同業公會準備國暦年終大結束以示遵行國暦之决心　　各方面陳述困難狀况　市商會先於某月某日接杭州市商會來函以本年國暦年終總結賬恐有困難擬請政府特准變通酌量延長以一個半月爲期函徵同意市商會接函後經常務會議討論上年以準備不及經奉准展緩一月原係一時過渡辦法本年係奉行國暦第二年商民巳習聞有素對於五底九底十二底結賬辦法似未便再有變更等語函復但其時蘇省江寗·蘇州·無錫·武進·丹陽·鎭江·六縣錢業公會推派代表在無錫開會以年終結賬實行困難議决請求訂立商民會計年底以國暦一月末日爲大結束之期同時江蘇各縣商會代表亦在鎭江會議議决對六縣錢業公會請求訂立商民會計年度案一致贊成並附加意見應照各縣征收漕銀限期辦法自十二月末日起展至國暦二月十五日完全結束俾得顧全事實不致發生困難即由六縣錢業公會三十九縣商會代表公呈蘇省政府請予備案同時本市豆米行·鮮猪行·花粉業·參燕業·水菓地貨行·帽莊業·轉運報關業·新藥業·綢緞業等同業公會均陳述按照國暦年終結賬本業在實際上各種困難情形希望市商會彙集各業意見向政府呈請變通</p>

<p>特貨全船被刦去</p>
<p>損失逹數十萬金</p>
<p>現由商局輪代運</p>
<p>兩湖辦理特税設有專局公開裝運每月自四川運輪至漢計有兩次公家抽收</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>特税寓徵於禁而且杜奸商私運之流弊距料近日裝運該貨之船忽在中途失事貨物盡被盜刦損失數十萬金刻下巳經本埠招商局派船　裝茲將此事之原委分誌如下</p>
<p>特貨運漢額　查四川特貨輸入兩湖自經設立特税局以後業經限訂數額由局長李慕青·與四川方面貨主商定每月規定輸入一千噸分兩批裝下每次運五百噸即一個月中裝入一萬六千八百擔在此限額之内其貨件由局發貼兩湖特税局之印花表示　捐之公開品如無此特種印花限行扣留重罰而承運之船亦歸局派以昭愼重船上且派武裝衛隊一排隨船上下故十分穏妥也</p>
<p>裝貨輪失事　特税局所派運貨之船曰蜀都號載量僅五百噸乃今次由宜昌滿裝特貨下水行至地名調城適値長江上游水淺該輪吃水較重而又行駛不愼即在該處江面淺灘擱阻船底爲沙泥吸牢進退不有船即失去行動能力不意擱礁之後便即發生盜刦</p>
<p>盜刦特税貨　今年上江匪盜本較往年爲多沿途不靖共黨樟匪到處均有若輩專以刦掠商船爲事自蜀都輪擱淺以後正擬報漢求援不意爲匪盜得知欺輪中衛兵無多乃結集在帮放水船到輪刦掠該貨船内之武裝衛兵與匪抗拒結果兵少匪多槍械被繳然後將全輪之特税貨刦下匪船掃數掠去比漢口派兵往救而匪巳飽掠而逸矣聞船員與衛兵有多人被匪擊傷云</p>
<p>快利輪裝運　此案發生以後局長李慕青·與四川貨主一再磋商追剿與善後方策除請武漢衛戍司今部派兵勦緝該匪並追取失貨外對於以後之承運問題决徇川中貨主要求改派大船但一時在上江無從租到乃由李慕青氏向本埠招商局商租長江輪船一艘承載該項特貨招商局己派漢口局長與李氏而議商定辦法（一）爲顧全税收由招商局就上江輪内撥出快利號一輪承運特貨但快利輪不能完全供給祗可每班留出全船容量十分之五裝運特税貨餘外則由該輪帶裝商貨（二）特税貨之水脚自宜昌至漢每擔收銀六兩五錢（三）駐船衛兵由特税局派定所需火食及餉項概歸特税局擔負以上辦法聞業經雙方同意即日可簽訂合同實行承裝該項貨件矣至於擱淺之蜀都輪由特税局另行派拖駁往救矣</p>

<h3 id="c285">巴黎音樂季 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 采</p>
<p>—每年十月起舉行—</p>
<p>巴黎的音樂季照例是由每年的十月開始一九二九年的則由荷蘭孔基特納波（曼格爾勃克指揮的）交嚮樂演奏會最先開奏接續的自十月的第一個星期六起各交嚮樂團體開定期始的演奏而深深的增加了音樂之秘的熱旺</p>
<p>定期演奏照例是三月完了或者是延長至四月初頭但此後也連夜的開催各種的演奏會並且伯林維也納是不必説就是委遠的紐約·波士頓的第一流樂團也常來該加而加盛春季的樂壇的（波士頓的幸福尼祗有一九二九—三○年的音樂季没有渡歐）此等演奏直至六月爲止故在巴黎不能聽到音樂祗是七月至九月的三個月而巳巴黎的交嚮樂團體約有十個在數目上柏林及維也　是遠不及的即紐約亦似有遜色所以實可觀是世界第一此等樂團大多在星期六及星期日的午後舉行定例演奏（夜間的交嚮演奏會是很少的）所以這兩天的演奏會常有重疊而一般巴黎人就往往苦於選擇了茲將在音樂季裏大顯本領之有名交嚮樂團約略介紹如下</p>
<p>第一流交嚮樂團體　巴黎現存的交嚮樂團體中屬於第一流的是康賽爾社康賽爾·谷魯奴康賽爾·拉姆爾康賽爾·白特爾等四個其中康賽爾社是音樂院的交嚮團同院的管絃樂科敎授菲利波哥倍爾氏爲指揮樂手也網羅了音樂的器院音科敎授法所以在技術方面也可説正是一流中的第一流的指揮者哥倍爾氏還兼劇塲的指揮者常常由他導演有名的戲劇他好似特别專門德國音樂所以音樂院的演奏目也特别多見多芬華格那的作品這確是很有力量的演奏尤其因爲音樂院的樂堂狹小故音嚮充滿全室而初聽的印象實有德國的交嚮樂之概定期演奏是音樂季中的每星期日午後</p>
<p>康賽爾·谷爾奴是老指揮者格勃利愛爾·彼爾納做頭目指揮者是年長者所以樂手亦多老人而演奏亦祗有老成堅實却没有生氣勃勃的氣概曲目亦比較沉舊其中雖亦有法國現存作家之新作初演的曲目以及斯托拉維斯基勃魯哥斐夫的作品而谷爾奴的本領可説不在這個地方老指揮者彼爾納對音樂雖有全般的豐富的智識和經騐且對新音樂亦有不少同情但同情和同感决不是一様的他們的定例演奏是每週的星期六星期日的午後塲所是西圖蘭劇塲</p>
<p>康賽爾·拉姆爾是呵爾倍爾·沃爾夫當着指揮者樂手方面雖和谷爾奴差不多但曲目的點上比谷爾奴要新頴得多了每週士曜日曜的兩日在格沃樂堂開定例演奏時每日總將國内外現存作家的初演曲目上演有時還柖勃魯哥斐夫而開催作曲者的自演並招拉維爾使其自執新作初演之指揮棒的此外一九二九年秋起至一九三○年春間所開奏的初演曲目有蘭司皮其（意大利人）的「羅馬的架」「羅馬的松」「羅馬的泉」的三部作以及西班牙作家佛利亞的「西班牙的夜之國」等沃爾夫本來是文學的指揮者的一人所以這些演奏細部的解釋方面當然極爲细緻而全體的集合上也少破綻所以是個老練的名指揮者</p>
<p>康賽爾白特爾是有二個指揮者一個是路納白敦一個是安格爾勃蘭克白敦是以音樂季之一半要費於外國的樂旅於是他不在的時候就由安格爾勃蘭克指揮安氏還很年輕故有不能勝任指揮者之概部份的解釋可説細膩但全體上還缺乏統御力的</p>
<p>白特爾在一九二九—三○年音樂季裏注全力於大曲之全曲演奏主要的是白哈的米沙獨皮希的「聖賽白斯金的殉敎」以及和俄國歌劇協會協力的「依哥爾公」「波立斯哥士諾夫」的演奏等定例演奏也是星期六及星期日會塲是興才利才劇</p>
<p>次於四樂團的樂團　第一流的交嚮樂團當然祗是上述四個而此外尚有未列第二流而即須加入第一流的樂團存在這就是略稱O.　Ｓ.　Ｐ.的和康賽爾·斯托拉姆的二個兩者因組織稍後所以資格尚淺因此在統制的點上也是稍遜於前者</p>
<p>第二流的二個樂園　第二流的兩個樂園是康賽爾·勃蘭和康賽爾·蕭安此外尚有康賽爾·森福尼克和康賽爾·狄勃吕猶二個團體前者爲日報「求爾納爾」的主催以同社的講堂爲會塲每隔週的日曜午後開定例演奏會至于曲目則大多爲通俗而長大的名曲很少全部演奏所以祇可説是啓蒙的運動指揮者是屠馬希後者則每週日曜開演奏會曲目除</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>絞樂曲外還加以獨唱獨奏合奏等諸多變化而比之前者更帶有一種啓蒙的性質</p>
<p>以上所述各交嚮樂團之演奏曲目當然以法國出品爲最多外國作家中現存的則以斯托拉維斯基最受歡迎而巴黎人亦十分愛好貝多芬及華格那的作品的</p>
<p>我們看了上述的情形可以明白現在的巴黎又是進入了青年們所期待的音樂季而每星期可有兩天去興賞醉人的音樂了巴黎人們呌做快樂之都的巴黎即此一點也就可以夠資格了吧</p>
<h3 id="c286">維奥伊 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 陳德明</p>
<p>夢的畫家</p>
<p>法國藝壇最近出現了一個驚人的畫家那就是夢的畫家維奥伊（ＪeanViollier)維氏今年還祗二十四歳可是他的新奇的藝術巳經使他站在法國畫家的前列之中了現在讓我來介紹這位新起的大畫家的藝術—</p>
<p>維奥伊在他的畫上創造了一個世界這世界是怎麽様的一個世界有些人説是一個瘋人的世界可是維奥伊並不是瘋子他的頭腦十分清爽有些人則説他是装瘋這也不對他從不作僞簡單説出來他是在畫一種前人所從未畫過的畫—夢的繪畫夢的繪畫與「夢般的」繪畫不同我們如果要了解維氏的藝術我們必須認清這個分别</p>
<p>維奥伊乃是客觀底地把人們在夜中所看見的世界記錄下來的他並不故意造出一個夢魔或一個美夢來他也並不是在肈錄他一個人或某某人的夢他是將一刹那間的夢景捉住了而賦之以繪畫的形式便之駐定於畫布之上的</p>
<p>我們看他那些畫的時候我們得到我們睡眼腥　時的那種感覺那種砧覺就是我們清清楚楚地看見一個幻象我們渴想把那幻象捉住可是那幻象倐忽萬變不由我們作主維奥伊却用了迅雷不及掩耳的敏捷手段把那些幻象捉住了表現在畫面之上</p>
<p>維奥伊的畫須與寓意畫（ＩaPeimtureallegorique)分别來看寓意畫畫家用象徵求提示觀念礕如畫一個手持天秤的盲婦以提示「公平」的觀念是這些寓意畫除了用晦　不明的象徵之外它們的意義是容易懂得的反之維奥伊的畫是不能用理智和邏輯去解釋的他的一幅畫上所畫着的許多東西都是些普通的正是夢的現象礕如這裏所附的揷圖「詩人的感興」一畫中所畫的人頭電桿電線人手和紙頭等等這些東西的集合是無邏輯可講的可是却是一個實情實理的夢</p>
<p>維奥伊的畫又須與那些夢般的畫分别清楚這一點上面巳經説過那些夢般的畫的作者原是因爲技能欠缺不能把他們的幻想用清楚的形式表現着因此把一切東西畫得異常惚恍渺茫眩斯人目而盜得詩意畫或神秘畫的美名反之維奥伊是把他的幻想極清晣地表見出來的他所畫的那些景物都是我們在夢中所能實在看見的我們看插圖詩人的感興這幅畫那並不是甚麽神秘畫乃是一個實在的夢的記錄這夢是你我所都能夢見的</p>
<p>維奥伊的畫因爲是夢的肈錄所以不但可洪愛好藝術者之欣賞而且足供心理學家的研究呢（按夢這様東西在近世心理學上占據重要地位）</p>
<p>上圖爲維奥伊之作品</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Disintegration of Yan and Feng's Forces <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Northwest Army Supports Zhang Shusheng</p>
<p>Jin Army Prepares to Abandon Datong</p>
<p>Beiping military authorities announced that Bai Fengxiang and Guo's troops on the Ping-Han Railway have completely occupied Shunde, while the infantry remains in Shizhuang. On the Ping-Sui Railway, Dong Yingbin's brigade has advanced to Chaigoubao but has not yet moved towards Pingdi Spring. Feng and Yan's forces have disintegrated, and there is no way to revive them. Wang has already fled to Tianjin in disguise. Shi Yousan's troops are still between Xinxiang and Shunde. For command convenience, they will be reorganized by the Northeast Army. As for the investigation chairman's statement, it is inaccurate. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Shusheng, who was detained by Feng in Beiping for opposing the central government in the past, is now loved and welcomed by the Northwest Army. He went to Shaanxi and met with Han Fuju before going to Zhengzhou, where he met with Sun Lianzhong in Xinxiang and had a very pleasant conversation. Zhang said to Sun that if Feng left Shanxi and went abroad, his subordinates would have a wider path to follow. The central government knows that the Northwest soldiers are hardworking and enduring, but now that Feng is still in Shanxi, those who are responsible for the incorporation dare not be completely at ease. In fact, Feng has already left the team, but it is always advisable to leave far away to avoid suspicion. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Xiu Jiaxun, said that Zhang Xueliang has agreed to allocate 600,000 stones of grain to Shi Yousan per month and will come to Beiping in a week. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Sun Lianzhong's headquarters is located in Xinxiang. There are still 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers and rifles in the Northwest Army, with only over 10,000. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Zhang Shusheng arrived in the capital today and plans to go to Shanghai immediately to visit Chiang in Fenghua in person to report on being detained for several months and on contacting Feng's generals to return to the central government. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, a Shenyang telegram stated that Chiang urged Yan and Feng to step down and implement the incorporation of the Shanxi and Northwest armies before meeting with Zhang. If a peaceful resolution is impossible, the central government and the Northeast will jointly send troops to thoroughly suppress them. Zhang expressed his support for this. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Sun Lianzhong telegraphed Li Hanhun, his representative stationed in Nanjing, stating that the inspection commissioner has arrived in Xinxiang and, as of today, has inspected more than 50,000 people, and appointed Li as the director of the Beijing office to handle all matters. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, military news, four Northeast aircraft flew from Beiping to Shijiazhuang, Shunde, Xuanhua, Niangziguan, Datong, and other places at 3:00 AM to scout. They saw that the Shanxi army was abandoning Datong and retreating to Yanmen. (One-day special dispatch)</p>

<p>Expansionist Elements Leave Taiyuan in Succession</p>
<p>It is Said that Wang Jingwei Has Already Arrived in Tianjin</p>
<p>Beiping, Wang has already arrived in Tianjin, and Feng arrived in Taiyuan on the 30th. Yan appointed Lu Zhonglin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Garrison, and Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan as the Commanders of the Shanxi-Suiyuan Garrison. Li Fu and others were appointed as the commanders and deputy commanders of the border defense. Only after the central government's aircraft arrived in Taiyuan and dropped bombs did Yan express his intention to step down at an opportune moment. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, a Tianjin telephone call reported that Zeng Zhongming, at the Astor House, entrusted Tong Jilong to secure four ship berths to France, saying that Wang and Feng would go from Jincheng to Taiyuan on the 30th. Wang would come to Tianjin soon. Shanxi money houses repeatedly urged Yan to leave the province, requesting that he not cause the people of Shanxi to be hit by aircraft bombs due to his personal attachment to his hometown. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Xie Chi and Zou Lu, whom Yan had not personally met before, only entrusted Zhao Pilian to send generous farewell gifts. The plaque of the expansion meeting at Bo Gongci has been taken down. Tan Zhen and Mao Zuquan were harassed by their subordinates and could only escape by distributing money. They will probably come to Tianjin in a few days. Zou plans to stay in Beiping and Tianjin for a short time. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo will come to Beiping and Tianjin from abroad. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, the Beiping Evening News reported that Feng only had the un-surrendered Liu Ruming, Pang Bingxun, and Sun Liangcheng's three divisions, totaling tens of thousands, with difficult supplies and an uncertain future. There are rumors that Feng will go to Russia. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, it is rumored that Wang Jingwei secretly arrived in Tianjin yesterday and will cross the sea to the east in the next few days. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, important figures from the Wang Jingwei, Zou Lu, Xie Chi, and other expansionist factions will leave Taiyuan today or tomorrow, either going to the foreign concessions in Tianjin via Beiping or going to Hong Kong. They will soon go their separate ways. Thus, the remnants of the Northern government can be said to be completely disintegrated. Finally, the issue of Yan and Feng's stepping down and traveling abroad is only a matter of time. (One-day telecommunications dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Wang Jingwei sees that Yan and Feng's power is gradually being eliminated and has now decided to go abroad, disguise himself, and sneak to Tianjin. He will take a convenient ship to depart soon. (One-day Japan Union News Agency dispatch)</p>

The tenants have no way of knowing whether Chuanshouli's houses have been sold by Chuanshou Company or not, but the receipts for the rent paid are the evidence, and the truth is far from it. The tenants all hold rent receipts from Chuanshou Company for July and August. If, as the company said, the property was sold by China Business Company in June of this year, then who is illegally collecting the rent for July and August, and who is fabricating and using these receipts?

<p>Merchants from Yangzhou, Dinghuai, and Supervisory Jiang are all aware: Recently, we heard the news that your merchants are organizing 120 votes of wheel transport, and the entire weir was shocked. This year, due to military influence, few supervisory documents have been made. Hundreds of river ships have been docked in the weir, some of which have only been transported once in half a year, and some have not yet been loaded for the whole year. The difficult situation cannot be described. Now, fortunately, the overall situation has been stabilized, and we hope that the supervisory document sources on all sides will be made to revive the Jiang ships that are waiting to die in distress. Unexpectedly, your merchants are only focused on wheel transport and disregard sail transport. This not only leaves no room for our Jiang ships to survive, but also declares the death sentence at the same time for all the workers and people from all walks of life in the weir, as well as those in the Yangtze River Basin who rely on the Huai supervisory document for their livelihood, directly or indirectly. I hope your merchants will have morality in mind. You must know that once the weir has no supervisory document to make, the severe winter will arrive in an instant, and the millions of people will be starving and freezing. How can we end the year? Please refrain from organizing wheel transport during this period to reassure the people and avoid unexpected events. We are eager to express ourselves. We hope for your attention.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Aboriginal Uprising in Taiwan <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Britain subdued the Afridi tribes in the Northwest Frontier of India in a matter of weeks, and Turkey quelled the rebellious Kurds who fled into Persia in a matter of days. Now, with Japan launching a major military offensive against the aboriginal tribes rioting in Taiwan, success should be easily achieved. After all, a large army with sophisticated weaponry attacking a tiny ethnic group with no ability or knowledge is like using an ox to crush a pig; those that are not killed are few. However, subduing them by force cannot last. It is neither possible to gather their tribe and annihilate them, nor possible to subdue their hearts and prevent them from rebelling again. Moreover, in this world where national liberation is paramount, all major powers are advocating for aiding the weak and eliminating the resentment of ethnic minorities. The League of Nations also views this as an important issue in the new pursuit of peace and has repeatedly discussed it. It is clear that dealing with such ethnic minorities who lack knowledge and ability cannot be done solely by force. Although the cause of this aboriginal uprising in Taiwan has not been determined, the sophistication of their combat methods, with an educated class acting as strategists, suggests that it is not a spontaneous event. Furthermore, their determination to fight to the death, with women killing themselves to eliminate any concerns for the men and to encourage their courage, with numbers reaching over one hundred and eighty, also suggests that they must be acting out of some extraordinary suffering and immense resentment. To not investigate the cause and handle it impartially, but instead to merely seek to suppress it by force, is not a fundamental solution. Some Japanese suspect that the aboriginal uprising was instigated by the Taiwanese people. If this is true, it indicates that the Taiwanese people also have no goodwill towards the Japanese. If this incites the Taiwanese people and draws them into the vortex of this rebellious tribe, then the situation will become even more serious. It must be understood that although the strength of the aboriginal tribes is small, the tide of national self-determination is extremely turbulent and cannot be resisted.</p>

<p>Shunde: Shi Yousan recently sent a telegram announcing the crushing of the mutinying soldiers in Huixian. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Liu Chunrong's troops stationed in Huixian, northern Henan, suddenly experienced internal strife a few days ago. Liu and several regimental commanders were killed. Two regimental commanders, Liu Wanchun and Shen Tichen, led their troops to escape after the incident. After the incident, this area immediately dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and repeatedly received detailed reports from the local area, learning that the perpetrators were the regimental commanders Chen Yaowu and Du Baoquan, etc. The cause of the incident was purely due to these regimental commanders being violent and avaricious by nature, being bribed and induced by others to achieve their goals of promotion and fortune. At the same time, they were also instigated and used by the Communists, taking the opportunity to disrupt the security of the north in order to echo the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi. Therefore, after the incident, they indiscriminately ravaged the area, kidnapping people, extorting ransoms, raping, looting, arson, and murder, stopping at nothing. Moreover, they repeatedly tempted the troops stationed in Jiji by this headquarters in every possible way, but failed. The local area was devastated and on the verge of becoming a raging fire. The people of the county repeatedly appealed to this area for rescue, and the correspondence and telegrams flew in, with representatives arriving one after another, their pleas being unusually urgent. Yousan is stationed here to suppress the chaos and has a responsibility. With the calamity at hand, how can I sit idly by? I deeply believe that the rebellious behavior of these troops, regardless of their killing of superior officers and rebellion, is already a crime deserving death, and their attempt to subvert the country and endanger the nation is even more unforgivable by law. If we do not take measures to eliminate them as soon as possible, the small trickle will become a river, and it will be difficult to remedy the situation when it has spread. However, because the matter concerns the expediency of responding to the chaos, military secrets are of the utmost importance, and it was not convenient to first request instructions, lest the opportunity be lost in the process. Therefore, I had no choice but to act in accordance with the circumstances and expedite the response. On the day of the survey, in response to the people's pleas, I supervised the dispatch of the main force to Huixian to suppress the rebels. The troops initially stubbornly resisted, but after being severely attacked, they were completely routed after more than 1,000 enemies were killed. Now it has been completely resolved. In addition to properly handling the aftermath in Huixian to clear the source of the chaos and maintain security, I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, so I have specially telegraphed a clear statement of the circumstances of the rebellion of these troops and the beginning and end of the response here. I ask for your clear understanding. Respectfully, Shi Yousan, Commander-in-Chief of the 13th Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army.</p>
<p>Beiping: A telegram from the Qixian Station on the Pinghan Railway states that Huixian is still occupied by Chen Yaowu's troops, and Shi's army has not advanced to surround it. Liu Wanchun's troops are at the Qixian Station. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese troops advance by air and land.</p>
<p>Aborigines defend relying on dangerous terrain.</p>
<p>Dentsu Telegram, Taipei, 1st - The ultimate target of the punitive expedition, the fierce aborigines of the Mahei tribe, seems to have set fire to the forests behind their tribal village. The fire is currently burning, intended to prevent the Lianhuakou unit from advancing from behind. They intend to establish a do-or-die position, resisting to the end and defending the tribal village. According to news obtained from the Dalan tribe, more than 180 women from the Mahei tribe committed suicide to prevent any hindrance to their actions and to encourage the rebellious aborigines. The aboriginal men claim that even if only one person remains, they will fight to the end.</p>
<p>Dentsu Telegram, Taipei, 1st - The rebel aborigine suppression headquarters of Major General Kamada arrived at the She society at 7:00 AM on the 31st. Upon the order of each unit, actions commenced immediately. The rebellious aborigines, who had been hiding in the Mali and Bao Yalu tribal villages, had retreated to the mountains the previous night and were nowhere to be seen. The units shifted from a general attack to a pursuit battle. The mountain artillery unit and the air squadron advanced by air and land in coordination. The Matsui battalion seized the He'e society in one fell swoop and burned the entire tribal village to the ground. Only the Mahei society remains, and the units are currently pursuing and advancing.</p>
<p>Dentsu Telegram, Wushe, Taiwan, 1st - Before sunset yesterday, the Mengge tribal village had already been conquered by the Japanese army. Currently, only the Maxiehuo tribal village remains to be attacked. The aborigines are using the village as a center and taking advantage of the natural defenses to create a continuous line of defense against the Japanese army. They have also planned to attack the Hualien Harbor area behind them. The Japanese army selected a roundabout route, sending a separate team to garrison the east of Maxiehuo, relying on dangerous obstacles to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Two iron bridges connecting to Maxiehuo have been destroyed by the aborigines to hinder the advance of the Japanese army. The Japanese engineering corps is currently repairing them. Once repaired, the second general attack will commence. Yesterday afternoon, the range of activity of the aborigines was limited to the Maxiehuo Creek basin, about two miles in size.</p>
<p>Dentsu Telegram, Taipei, 1st - The Japanese army aircraft attacking the Maxiehuo society made a low-altitude flight over the Maxiehuo society at 8:00 AM this morning, dropping three bombs. One of the bombs hit an area where the aborigines were gathered, causing significant damage. Yesterday, during the Japanese army's attack on the Mengge society, two soldiers from the 9th company of the Taipei Infantry Regiment died and seventeen were seriously or lightly wounded.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Tokyo, 1st - According to news from Taipei, Japanese soldiers and police, together with machine gun teams and airplanes, attacked the aborigines yesterday. The enemy was forced to destroy their houses and retreat. It is reported that eighteen aborigines were killed and two Japanese police officers were injured. One Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and destroyed a pontoon bridge behind the aboriginal positions, cutting off the aborigines' retreat route.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Tokyo, 1st - According to Taiwanese official circles, the Wushe Incident has resulted in 42 Japanese deaths, 72 survivors, and 153 missing persons. Among the dead are 29 police officers and 7 family members, and among the missing are 19 police officers and 107 family members. In yesterday's battle, two Japanese soldiers were killed and seven were wounded. According to scout reports, the aborigines burned their houses, leaving only one, and then dispersed into small teams, but their main force is still resisting stubbornly and has not retreated.</p>
<h3 id="e89">French Policy in Vietnam <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Plans to build naval ports in Saigon and other locations.</p>
<p>Determined to take high-pressure tactics against revolutionary actions.</p>
<p>Paris News - French Minister of Colonies, Mr. Piétri, stated that French Indochina has been unstable lately due to frequent revolutionary events. He recently spoke at the Marseille Mediterranean and Colonial Business Conference, reporting and explaining the situation in Vietnam and the French government's policies. He said that the government has decided to appoint a special committee to consider and investigate ways to improve all issues in Vietnam. The selection of committee members will be determined in consultation with the Supreme Colonial Council and the Permanent Advisory Council for Colonial Affairs, which is composed of former colonial ministers and governors. After the selection, a meeting will be held in Marseille around the end of October. Piétri also stated that there have been many disturbances in the French colonies recently, but the French government has decided to take decisive measures to suppress these revolutions. The government cannot tolerate the illegal assassination methods of the rebels. Comparing the situation in Vietnam before the arrival of the French and today, one can see the achievements of the French over the years. Indochina has now become one of the best places in the world, and France can be proud of this. The taxes levied on the people in Indochina are much higher than in neighboring countries such as Japan and Siam. The current disturbances are only the work of a few troublemakers and are not a widespread phenomenon, so there is no cause for concern. The entire Asian continent is currently in a state of frenzy, with chaos in the Dutch East Indies and British India, but the Dutch and British are dealing with it calmly, and France can learn from this. In the future, France's policy towards Indochina will be "respecting the national character of Indochina within the French Federation." Finally, Piétri stated that the French government plans to build five naval ports in Saigon, Casablanca, and other places in the near future to facilitate troop movements and avoid the risk of military equipment being concentrated in one place, making it difficult to transfer.

<h3 id="e90">Trend Towards Economic Union in the Danube River Basin Countries <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Czech Republic changes its opposition to support.</p>
<p>Prague News - After the signing of the peace treaty after the Great War, the Austrian federation was split into three. The 83,832 square miles lost were replaced by the independent and unconnected Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. As a result, all felt isolated economically. This situation is true not only for Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, but also for other countries in the Danube River basin and the Balkans. Recently, Yugoslavian cabinet member Mr. Fulanji Qixiu came to Prague, and it is rumored that his purpose is to contact the Czech Republic and other countries to create a new union. Romanian Prime Minister Maniu also recently stated that the need for a closer union among the countries of Central and Southern Europe is undeniable. The economic value of the former Austro-Hungarian federation in Europe is undeniable. Although the national consciousness of the various ethnic groups in the federation gradually deepened, leading to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian federation, there is reason to hope for the re-establishment of a union of Danube River countries in the economic field. The special reason for the current economic difficulties in Central Europe is the surplus of American products and the devaluation of Soviet Russian goods, but the more general main reason is the lack of communication and cooperation in Central Europe itself. Czech Finance Minister Mr. Maiqilu expressed great sympathy for Maniu's remarks and said that the number of unemployed workers in the Danube River countries is increasing due to the universal economic recession. The government should strive to provide relief, but at the same time, the difficulties of farmers should not be ignored. The Czech Republic used to be extremely suspicious of any plans to discuss economic cooperation among the countries of the Danube River, but now it has changed its attitude and eliminated all baseless fears. The Sinai Conference and Bucharest Conference of Romania, Yugoslavia, and Hungary were purely agricultural issues and did not conflict with the interests of the industrial Czech Republic. Now the attempt of the Danube River countries has exceeded the so-called agricultural union and become a customs union. It is a union that combines the agricultural countries of Southeastern Europe and the industrial countries of Central Europe, including the Czech Republic and Poland. (World)</p>
<h3 id="e91">General Meeting of Japanese Farmers' Associations <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>A major disturbance occurred.</p>
<p>Dentsu Telegram, Tokyo, 1st - The general meeting of national farmers' associations opened at the Aoyama Hall at 11:00 AM today. More than 2,500 people attended, coming from as far as Okinawa and Hokkaido. After the meeting began, a declaration expressing the plight of farmers was read aloud. When a resolution was about to be presented, a loud noise erupted in the assembly hall. Some said that the resolution declaration was too mild, while others said that it was unreasonable for the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry not to attend. Eventually, the meeting turned into a brawl that could not be controlled. The resolution and the peaceful declaration seeking to improve the agricultural and forestry recession were handed over to a committee for further review. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>The meeting reconvened at 0:50 PM. The atmosphere was tense. The committee reported on the re-examination of the declaration and resolution. In the end, it was decided to approve the original proposal. Two representatives from each prefecture were selected as executive committee members to study the implementation methods. The declaration and resolution will be sent to Prime Minister Hamaguchi, as well as to the Minister of Finance and the headquarters of the Minsei and Seiyu parties to make representations. The executive committee is scheduled to continue its discussions tomorrow and will not leave Tokyo until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>The resolutions are as follows: (A) Regarding maintaining rice prices: (1) Resolutely purchase large quantities of rice. (2) Provide low-interest funding and grant incentive money to those who store rice. (3) Restrict the importation of Korean rice and Taiwanese rice. (B) Two items each regarding maintaining cocoon prices and reducing the burden on farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Detailed Account of British Airship R-101's Accident in France <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>(2) Circumstances of the accident (continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>After leaving the Cardington airfield at 6:30 PM on the 4th for its trip to India, the R-101 sent telegrams to the French Bourget radio station almost every hour. The last telegram was sent at 1:50 AM, when the airship was about one kilometer south of Beauvais in the countryside. The telegram also said that the passengers in the ship had a great meal and smoked countless cigarettes before retiring to their rooms to sleep. Unexpectedly, disaster struck ten minutes later, and dozens of passengers, who were enjoying a good dream, were reduced to ashes. The circumstances of the airship accident can be gleaned from the description of a resident near the accident site. According to the villager, "Around two o'clock in the morning on the 4th, I suddenly heard the roar of many engines in the air while dreaming. I knew it must be an airship or an airplane passing through. Looking out the window, I saw a large airship in the air heading towards Paris, but it seemed to be hindered by a strong wind and was moving very slowly. A few minutes later, the airship suddenly descended sharply, and the hull immediately touched the ground, causing a terrible explosion. The fire illuminated the town of Beauvais, which was kilometers away, like daylight from the dark night. The high tower of the town's cathedral was as clear as possible. A few minutes later, there was another explosion, but it was slightly weaker than the first. The fire caused by the explosion continued for a quarter of an hour, then gradually faded and disappeared completely after an hour." Within minutes of the airship accident, the villagers of Allonne rushed to the accident site. At that time, the airship was burning fiercely, and onlookers could not get close. The screams of the passengers being burned in the ship could be faintly heard. Eight people had escaped from the airship, but they were burned and unable to walk. They were still moving on the grass near the airship and were fortunately rescued by the villagers and sent to a nearby hospital for emergency surgery. Those who did not escape were carbonized along with the airship. The villagers were powerless to help and could only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>(3) Various events after the accident</p>
<p>The airship continued to burn until about 5:00 AM, leaving only a huge skeleton, but it was still burning and impossible to approach. The engines and other parts were deeply embedded in the ground, a truly terrible sight. By this time, local officials had already received the news and rushed to the scene. The French Director General of Aviation, who was far away in Paris, also rushed to the scene after receiving the telegram. His quick response was truly amazing. A rescue team composed of firefighters and police officers had already begun to retrieve the bodies. By noon, 47 burned bodies had been recovered, all charred and unidentifiable. All coffins, regardless of quality or size, were collected from the area, but there were still not enough. Personnel sent by the British Embassy in Paris attempted to identify the bodies of Aviation Minister Thomson and Director Blanc, but it was impossible. It is said that these burned bodies will be transported back to England in the future and buried together near the Cardington airfield as a permanent memorial. The respect shown by the French to the victims of the R-101 disaster can be described as extraordinary. After the bodies were placed in coffins, they were displayed at the Allonne Village Office and mourned by the public. French Prime Minister Tardieu personally paid his respects, and the French Navy, Army, and Air Force sent representative units to mourn. At the same time, the French government ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast for one day in mourning. This is not only a sign of sympathy for the disaster of a friendly country but also a manifestation of humanity in a civilized nation. The cause of the R-101 disaster is still unknown. The British government has sent specialists to the accident site to investigate and will provide a satisfactory explanation in the future after careful investigation. According to the speculation of a French expert, there was heavy rain on the night of the 4th, and the wind was very strong. The R-101 was probably compressed by the amount of rain and shaken by the strong wind. The gas stored in the ship condensed due to the moisture, which made the airship heavier and more difficult to fly high. During the difficult voyage, a certain moving part may have been damaged, causing the airship to fall directly to the ground and explode.</p>
<p>After the accident, governments, organizations, or individuals from various countries sent telegrams to the British government and the British aviation industry to express their condolences. However, one telegram that may have made the British feel somewhat embarrassed was the telegram from Dr. Eckener, the commander of the German Zeppelin airship, which had successfully circumnavigated the world. After the European War, Germany's military strength was almost zero due to the restrictions of the peace treaty. The only thing that the Germans were proud of was the long-term progress of their science. The world tour of the Zeppelin airship can be seen as a kind of scientific demonstration. When the Zeppelin airship circled over Paris and London, the French and British felt uncomfortable in addition to being amazed, which was not without reason. During the International League of Nations conference in September of this year, when the German representative was giving a speech, the Zeppelin airship actually soared over the roof of the conference hall, making its demonstration even more obvious. At that time, the United Kingdom still had an R-101 that could match the Zeppelin, but what about now? It was destroyed due to poor manufacturing. After the news of the R-101 accident reached Germany, Dr. Eckener sent a telegram to British Prime Minister MacDonald in the name of all the staff of the Zeppelin airship to express his condolences. At the same time, he declared to the Montag Post reporter that the Zeppelin airship could be guaranteed to be free from the same danger in any storm. His pride can be imagined.</p>
<p>While mourning the R-101, people will be even more impressed by the magnificent appearance of the German Zeppelin airship in the future. (Six Zeng, sent from Paris)</p>

<p>Seeking China's complete sovereignty in treaties.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, San Francisco, 31st - This Reuters correspondent informed Lin Baike of the Chinese Minister of Finance, Mr. Song Ziwen's, statement that the Ministry of Finance's policy of not borrowing foreign debts will not change until the National Government has disposed of the outstanding Chinese and foreign debts. Lin said that his primary task in coming to the United States is to seek China's complete sovereignty in treaties. This is the most important basis for all kinds of loans to China. All countries must recognize China as a sovereign and independent country and abolish all unequal treaties. Only then can any kind of loan be regarded as appropriate from the Chinese point of view. Therefore, his job is to report to Nanjing on treaties and economic conditions related to the US and other countries involving the Chinese government. Lin also said that when the National Government receives his report on the treaty, it may not handle silver loans. Lin did not say that he is only the legal advisor to the Chinese government and not the financial agent of the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Reuters Telegram, London, 31st - The Imperial Parliamentary Association hosted a banquet in London tonight for representatives of the Imperial Conference. British Prime Minister MacDonald presided over the meeting. During the meeting, representatives exchanged views. MacDonald praised the Imperial Conference for its inspiring spirit and said that the conclusion of the conference is not far away. Those who attended the meeting can congratulate themselves that the conference is not empty and meaningless. Australian Prime Minister Scullin said that he does not know what kind of benefits this conference can bring in terms of the imperial concept. Those who attended the meeting have benefited a lot from contacting each other. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett said that the equal status granted to overseas autonomous regions in 1926 does not mean that the autonomous regions have obtained a license to terminate the links that bind them together as soon as possible. South African Prime Minister General Herzog spoke exclusively on the British government's policy towards the local people in Africa. He said that if the culture of the white people is to be maintained, then the superiority of the white people in South Africa is necessary. The British government should work more closely with the South African government to jointly decide on its policy towards the local people in other parts of Africa.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Uze’s Account of the Sino-Russian Conference <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>From our Shenyang correspondent: Uze, Director of the Library of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Shenyang, was summoned by Mo Teh-hui to go to Moscow on official business. After the opening of the Sino-Soviet Conference, he was again dispatched back to China to report on everything. He arrived in Shenyang on the 26th. Yesterday, this writer made a special visit to Uze's residence to record his account, as follows:</p>
<p>"The delegation to Russia arrived in Moscow on May 9th, and it has been more than half a year since then. Madam Mo, as well as Cai Gongzhi, Wang Yuebo, Wang Xinzhang, Nan Xianyi, Mr. Cui Shuyan, and the two ladies, Sun Suzhen, all live at No. 5 Little Kirov Street, the office of the Sino-Soviet Conference delegation. The four committee members, Liu Shaozhou, Li Yisun, Tu Dingfu, and Wang Nianjian, and the two secretaries, Wang Yunqing and Xie Zhongqing, all live in the Minde Hotel. The members of the delegation are extremely united in spirit abroad and all have a firm and enduring spirit to work hard for the country. In addition to their official duties, they also visit various places. Their handwritten diaries of their mission to Russia, one volume per month, contain detailed records and concise criticisms of the progress of the conference, the political situation and customs of the Soviet Union, and international trade relations. They plan to publish them as a book after returning home. Although Mr. and Mrs. Mo's diet and living arrangements are still comfortable, being far away in a foreign country, shouldering heavy responsibilities, and struggling in a difficult environment for half a year, one can imagine their hardship. On the 8th of this month, Mr. Mo met with Karakhan to discuss the date of the conference. Mr. Mo advocated for an early implementation, but Mr. Karakhan said that the Turkish Foreign Minister would arrive in Russia at the beginning of the month and would need to be received and seen off, so he wished to postpone it for a few days. Therefore, the two sides decided to officially open the conference on the 11th. The venue was chosen at the Foreign Ministry building, which is where the Soviet People's Committee for Foreign Affairs holds important meetings and receives foreign guests. The architecture is magnificent and the furnishings are rich and luxurious, resembling the Yingbin Hotel in Shidaren Hutong in our former capital. Those who accompanied Mr. Mo that day were the four committee members, Liu, Li, Tu, and Wang, the secretaries Cai Yunchen and Zhang Mingzhe, and the staff members Nan Wenming, Cui Shuyan, Ping Jie, etc. They all arrived at 5:00 PM. The Soviet Plenipotentiary Representative, Karakhan, greeted them at the door and shook hands with each of them. First, Karakhan and Mo talked briefly in a side room, and then they all gathered in the meeting hall. Karakhan gave a speech first and expressed his welcome. Then, Mo gave a speech. After the two sides spoke, they exchanged credentials. The procedures were all completed. Karakhan then asked the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Chinese government to clearly express his views on the Buriat-Mongolian Treaty Record. Mo advocated discussing issues such as the Eastern Railway in accordance with the powers conferred by the credentials. Karakhan still insisted on questioning about the Buriat-Mongolian Treaty Record. Mo, from beginning to end, based his arguments on the spirit of the government's February 8th declaration and argued with him. The debate lasted for three hours, and it was already after 8:00 PM. Because it was late, it was announced that the meeting was adjourned. This is the general situation of the official opening of the Sino-Soviet Conference. Although the meeting ended without a clear understanding, Mo's attitude can be said to be unyielding, indignant about the matter, and not disgracing the country. However, in the half year before the opening of the conference, Mo faced many twists and turns in negotiating the opening procedures. The first difficulty was on the Soviet side. Mo's credentials were specifically for discussing the aftermath of the Chinese Eastern Railway, while Karakhan's credentials were for discussing everything related to the Buriat-Mongolian Treaty Record, the Eastern Railway, trade, and the resumption of diplomatic relations. Karakhan believed that Mo's authority was insufficient and requested a change of credentials. Mo negotiated and protested repeatedly. After that, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to the Soviet Foreign Ministry, stating that our Plenipotentiary Representative had the power to discuss the Eastern Railway, the resumption of transportation, and trade. However, Karakhan's attitude was still not satisfied. After repeated negotiations by Mo, Karakhan finally stopped nitpicking, which he himself considered a very large concession. This issue was delayed for a long time, and it seemed inconvenient to publish it at that time. These twists and turns from six months ago were also the reason why the domestic public opinion circles felt that the news was dull. Mo overcame this difficulty before the official conference could be held. Unexpectedly, it ended without a clear understanding due to the issue of the Buriat-Mongolian Treaty Record. How it will proceed in the future is still up to the two representatives to sincerely negotiate and depends on the sincerity of the Soviet Union towards the Sino-Soviet Conference. However, the newspapers in that country generally believe that the Buriat-Mongolian Treaty Record is a prerequisite for the conference. The commentary in their party's organ newspaper was full of criticism of our government, and the title was "Must Give a Clear Answer," which shows their attitude.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent reports in various newspapers that the delegation was preparing to return home, this is inaccurate. I have not heard Mo express this. As for Mo's trip to Leningrad, it was because after Mo arrived in the Russian capital, the Soviet Foreign Ministry, in addition to hosting visits in the Moscow area, also invited him to visit Leningrad (i.e., St. Petersburg) and the Caucasus and southern Russia, and to see the new constructions of their Five-Year Plan. Mo was unable to go before due to negotiating the opening of the conference. Now that the official conference has opened and the progress of the conference has been telegraphed to the government for instructions, he is taking advantage of this time to fulfill his appointment since Karakhan has also invited him to visit. When I left, I heard that Mo planned to leave on the 19th and return to Moscow on the 23rd. I left Moscow at 6:30 PM on the 16th. According to the itinerary, I should have arrived in Manchuria on the morning of the 23rd. However, because the dining car attached to the train derailed on the Ural Mountains at the border of Europe and Asia on the 17th, we were delayed for seven hours. Therefore, I arrived in Manchuria at 4:00 PM on the 23rd, Harbin at 1:00 PM on the 24th, and Shenyang on the 26th. During the seven-day journey, food was scarce, and bread and milk were often difficult to obtain, and there were often times when I had to endure hunger. Along the way, there were many new buildings and new agricultural tools that were still under construction, which were the beginnings of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Industrial Plan. When the train arrived at the Sino-Soviet border, it stopped for an hour. Special Soviet police inspected passports and checked luggage. All Soviet currency and works of art were not allowed to be taken out of their territory by passengers. The prohibition was very strict and the inspection procedures were also very complicated. However, Chinese delegation staff were treated very favorably when entering and leaving the territory. Therefore, I only had my passport checked and was not inspected. When the train left the Xiaozhan station, 66 li from the border, and entered Chinese territory, I felt a surge of joy in my heart. After another ten li to Manchuria, the train I was on was attached to the Chinese Eastern Railway Express. Looking out the window, the most heartbreaking thing was passing by the cemetery of the soldiers who died in battle last year in Zhalantun, which stood tall by the roadside." (October 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Begin Bandit Suppression <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>From our Hankou correspondent: Since He Chengjun returned to Hankou to preside over the war zone headquarters and convened a meeting with He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, and Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, the voices of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have become very loud. The results of the consultations on the allocation of troops, the division of areas, and the funding arrangements have also been largely determined and implemented separately. The first to launch was Jiangxi Province. Most of the bandits, except for the two divisions of He Long and Kuang Duoxun on the border of Hunan and Hubei, and the Li Can division that occasionally harassed eastern Hubei, the remaining cadres such as Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue all fled to Ji'an and Jishui in Jiangxi, which were successively captured. The authorities had no choice but to prioritize and start with Jiangxi Province. Recently, the troops supporting Jiangxi have been recruited by land and water. In addition to the original divisions of Zhang Hui Zan and Deng Ying, Hunan Province has sent the two divisions of Luo Lin and Li Jue to enter Jiangxi, and the Gong Bingfan division has entered Jiangxi from Hankou. Other divisions such as Tan Daoyuan, Mao Bingwen, Tai Shihui, Xu Kexiang, and the Peng Qibiao Brigade have also arrived one after another to encircle and suppress. The Wuhan war zone headquarters is still worried that the troop strength is insufficient and has specially transferred the two divisions of Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai to Jiangxi to assist. They are currently being concentrated separately to be transported by rotation. At this time, Hunan is in urgent need again. The bandits harassing Hunan suddenly captured Nanhua and have the momentum to counterattack Pingliu. He Jian has sent troops to suppress them on the one hand and telegraphed to the war zone headquarters to quickly allocate reinforcements on the other. He himself has also scheduled to leave for Pingliu within a few days to inspect. After receiving the telegram, the Hankou war zone headquarters, in addition to ordering the Qian Dajun division to temporarily stay in Hunan, will also add two divisions to enter Hunan from Hubei. There is also talk that a part of Xu Yuanquan's Forty-eighth Division will also be transferred to Hunan. He Chengjun has now issued an order that all troops designated to suppress bandits in the area must be deployed by the first day of next month and concentrated by the seventh day. The bandit suppression funds will be temporarily borrowed from the central government's new short-term treasury bills of one million yuan for application. It is reported that the bandit suppression military affairs in the Nanhua area have been quite smooth in recent days. If Wuhan sends a large army to assist, the Hunan bandits can be eliminated in one fell swoop. He Jian sent a telegram to Hankou yesterday to report on the bandit suppression situation as follows: "On the Nanhua side, the Sixteenth Division, Peng Weiren's division, has been ordered to suppress them. Sanxian Lake was recovered by Xiang Guangquan's regiment yesterday. The bandits retreated to Nanxian. The Sichuan Army Zhang's division arrived at Mahekou and has made contact with our army. Peng Dehuai's bandit division has returned to the area of Jietou and Sanyanqiao, attempting to attack Liu. Tao's division is suppressing them in Pingjiang. He Jian kowtows." (October 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Course of the Labor Dispute at the Dakang Cotton Mill in Qingdao <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>From our Qingdao correspondent: The Sifang Dakang Cotton Mill in Qingdao is run by the Japanese and employs about 4,000 male and female workers. Since August, labor-management disputes have occurred frequently. Recently, there has been a strike. The reason is that on the 11th of this month, a worker named Su Dingzhu was expelled by the factory for sleeping in the factory. The workers in the second workshop were greatly displeased and stopped working for three hours, and demanded that Su's job be restored within the day and that wages be paid during the shutdown period. The factory firmly refused to accept this, and the dispute was about to escalate. After consultation between the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Association for the Promotion of Civic Education, the factory was allowed to expel Su Dingzhu, and the remaining workers would not be held accountable. The wages for the shutdown period would be paid. Both parties have acknowledged this. At 10:00 PM on the 19th, the factory suddenly telegraphed the Bureau of Social Affairs, claiming that on that day, the workers in the fine yarn department of the first workshop had been engaging in slowdowns from day to night, and had been using wooden pipes to hit Japanese staff and Chinese foremen, obstructing them from performing their management duties, and requested that personnel be dispatched quickly to stop them. The Bureau of Social Affairs sent personnel to investigate. According to the workers, the reason why the workers were engaging in this behavior was that they were angry that the factory had reinstated Li Zhaohuan and Lü Xiben, the leaders of the Kedaohui organization. If Li and Lü were removed from the factory, it could be guaranteed that this would never happen again. The bureau immediately advised the factory to dismiss Li and Lü to avoid giving the workers an excuse, and sent clerk Deng Xin to proclaim this to the workers. On the 20th and 21st, the fine yarn departments of the first and second workshops of the factory had another slowdown due to the issue of shift changes. Then, Bureau of Social Affairs Director Yang Jinsheng personally engaged in practical negotiations with the factory's Tang Xian and the consultant of the Japanese Spinning Industry Association, Hiraoka Kotaro. After spending a long time, the factory finally managed to complete the shift change and restore work. On the 22nd, the workers in the fine yarn departments of the first and second workshops of the factory had another dispute over wages. The Bureau of Social Affairs negotiated with the factory again. As a result, the factory agreed to settle the wages for the 20th and 21st according to the average daily wage of the previous week. The workers were satisfied and resumed work as usual. In addition, the weft department of the weaving workshop also experienced slowdowns and demanded that the factory equalize wages. All of these were resolved through mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs. At present, the labor dispute at the factory has been completely resolved, and the workers have all resumed work. However, the municipal government is still afraid that unscrupulous elements will disrupt the situation and specially issued a notice yesterday, advising the workers of the factory to work with peace of mind and not to be instigated by others, lest they incur blame and punishment.

<p>The Zhejiang Transportation Office has received a telegram from the salt merchants of Huangwanchang, requesting that the change from boiling to drying salt be extended for a period of three years. A decision has not yet been made. The change to drying salt at Xuchangchang is imminent. The seasonal salt merchants of the field are pleading for the Huangwan method to be used to maintain their livelihoods. Zhou, the Transportation Commissioner, believes that since the date of abandonment of Huangwan boiling is not yet determined, the request is very confusing. The livelihood of the laborers is in trouble, and it is dangerous. He has no choice but to find a way to improve the situation. Yesterday, he specially submitted a report to the Salt Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, requesting a review and instructions to follow.</p>

<p>Surveying and Establishing a Public Telephone Office: The Construction Bureau is installing long-distance telephones in various streets in order. However, since the city exchange is located in a remote area, it is inconvenient for callers to go to the bureau to make calls. Director Wei has specially surveyed and determined that two public telephone offices should be set up in front of and next to the gate. It is estimated that the construction will cost more than 650 yuan. The bureau has submitted a request for approval. The Construction Department approved the request yesterday. Director Wei has ordered the county to allocate funds for the installation.</p>
<p>Water Police Arrest Fugitive Squad Leader: Jiang, the squad leader of the Fifth Squad of the Water Police, was previously ordered to suppress bandits in Jiangbei. It was discovered that Xu Kun, the squad leader of the district, was suspected of collaborating with bandits and had fled without a trace. Squad Leader Jiang immediately submitted a report to the province to request assistance in arresting him. The Department of Civil Affairs approved the report yesterday and issued a notice to all county water and land police teams to assist in the arrest.</p>
<p>Water Police Arrest Two Bandits: Xu Boying, the squad leader of the Fourteenth Squad of the Water Police, joined forces with Fang Yue, the captain of the guerrilla team, to capture a bandit named Zhou Shimin (also known as Zhou Tuozi) in Wujiang the day before yesterday. He was escorted to Suzhou on the night before last and sent to the Third District for review. In addition, Xu Ziyuan and Fang Shunhe, two detectives from the Fourteenth Squad, captured a bandit named Li Desheng in the Deshenglou teahouse outside the Panmen Gate in Suzhou the day before yesterday (31st). A symbol of the Fifteenth Squad was found on him. He was escorted to the Third District yesterday. Xu Boying, the squad leader of the Fourteenth Squad of Wujiang, ordered Huang Xiyuan, a patrol officer, to come to Suzhou to meet and escort Li to the Wujiang County Government for review. According to the Water Police detectives, Li is related to the murder of Du Jingwu, a squad leader of the Fifteenth Squad.</p>
<p>Director Li Accused of Abuse: Han Jizhi, the district chief of Dongshan Seventeenth District, and Li Kerong, the director of the local Public Security Bureau, were accused of independently handling criminal cases and arbitrarily fining Zou citizens Jin Sijiu 280 yuan. Zhang Ziping, a citizen who was released, filed a complaint with the local court. Judge Lu of the local court opened a court yesterday to summon and interrogate them, and found that District Chief Han and Director Li had violated judicial independence.

<p>Further News on the Arrest and Escort of the Liyang County Bureau Chief to the Province: It is now known that the whistleblower in the case of the Liyang County Bureau Chief's previous collusion in corruption was actually a reporter from the Capital Central Daily. Therefore, the newspaper recorded the truth of the case in great detail. As for the Huang Xingan case (erroneously reported as Wang Xingan yesterday), who surrendered himself, he was the Deputy Director of the Field Tax Office during the tenure of Zhang Quan, the former Director of Finance. The Director was Cheng Lintu. Cheng fled after hearing the news after Pan Bin was arrested. Huang knew that he could not escape, so he came forward to surrender himself in order to be questioned. Since the beginning of the case, the provincial government has arrested Zheng Chengyuan, Pan Bin, Shen Zhiqing, Cao Qingzhi, Ren Shuchun, Di Zhen, Huang Xingan, and Zhou Shi in succession. Zhou Shi is currently the Director of the Fourth District of Liyang. Wang Rou, a member of the Third Division of the Provincial Government, secretly went to Liyang on the 30th to meet with You Bingzhao, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, to draft a letter inviting Zhou to talk. Zhou came to the meeting without suspicion and was immediately arrested. The Public Security Bureau sent four police officers to escort him back to the province overnight with Wang. The reason for his arrest was that Shen Zhiqing had stated during interrogation that Zhou was friendly with Cheng Lintu. As a result, he was arrested. On the morning of the 31st, Qian Jiaxiang, the director of the Third Division, questioned him for a long time and continued to question Pan Bin and Shen Zhiqing. Ren Shuchun claimed that he was only a witness after being detained. Therefore, he was very uneasy and still treated people with the dignity of the Director of the Education Bureau, which affected the soldiers guarding him.

<p>Bandit Atmosphere on the Border of Henan and Anhui: The border area between Henan and Anhui has been ravaged by bandits for many years, and the people have suffered greatly. In previous years, Li Laomo and Li Kebang led more than 10,000 people to disturb the territory of Fuyang, causing great local losses. Since Li Laomo was executed and Li Kebang was pacified, the bandit atmosphere has slightly subsided. Although there are scattered bandits, the whole county of Fuyang has organized people's self-defense corps, with considerable self-defense capabilities, so a small number of bandits dare not do harm. Unexpectedly, in late this month, more than 1,000 Henan bandits sneaked into the northwest territory of Fuyang, breaking villages and forts in succession, with a very rampant momentum. The bandit suppression headquarters in Anhui Province recently received a quick telegram from Zhao Rui, the magistrate of Fuyang County, and immediately ordered the 135th Regiment of the 45th Division under its command, as well as Liu Zixin, the commander of the 270th Regiment stationed in Fuyang, to quickly lead his troops to suppress the bandits. After receiving the order, Commander Liu is now assembling his troops and cooperating with the people's self-defense corps to advance and suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>Differences of Opinion Between the Director of Education and Provincial Schools</p>
<p>There has been a state of unrest in Jiangsu education recently, stemming from Chen Hexian's tenure as Director of Education, during which he has been extremely isolated from Jiangsu education and unwilling to accept any input from the education sector. He consistently ignores appeals, and the arrears in educational funding are increasing daily. Teachers and staff cannot maintain their livelihoods. Representatives have been rejected when seeking audiences to discuss the matter, leading to accumulated resentment and brewing turmoil. It is said that some school principals are stepping forward to mediate, advising the authorities to change their attitude in order to cooperate, fearing that the loss of Jiangsu's educational spirit after the outbreak of turmoil would be difficult to recover. It is also heard that the central government is paying close attention to this matter, and there is talk of an exchange of education directors between two provinces, which may not be unfounded.</p>

<p>The pension regulations for school vocational educators were originally promulgated by the central government's Ministry of Education, but the length of service required and the amount of the pension were too high, making implementation difficult. The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, noting that some vocational educators in the city have died after continuous service of three or five years, but were unable to receive pensions due to legal restrictions, has found their dedication to public service and their posthumous circumstances deeply regrettable. Director of Education Zhang has drafted a simplified version of the pension for vocational educators in Nanjing Municipal Schools, requesting the Ministry of Education to slightly amend the length of service requirement. Director-General Jiang of the Ministry of Education received him and praised the proposal, agreeing to adopt it as much as possible when revising the regulations. At the same time, the bureau has submitted the draft bylaws to the municipal government for approval and filing. The draft bylaws are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Simplified Bylaws on Pension for Vocational Educators in Nanjing Municipal Schools: 1. The pensions for vocational educators in municipal schools in this city shall be handled in accordance with these bylaws, in addition to complying with central government regulations. 2. Vocational educators in municipal schools in this city who meet one of the following conditions may receive a pension: (1) Death after continuous service of three years or more (2) Death after continuous service of five years or more. 3. The pension payment standards are as follows: Full-time vocational educators who meet the first item of Article 2 shall receive two months of their final monthly salary; those who meet the second item shall receive three months of their final monthly salary. 4. The calculation of years of service shall be limited to continuous service in one school, except when the transfer to another school is with the permission of the school chief, or approved for special reason by the school head. 5. To claim a pension, each school must have its legal heirs submit a fact-filled application and the claimed amount, which shall be submitted by the school chief to this bureau, and the bureau will dispatch personnel to investigate and verify it before submitting it to the municipal government for approval and allocation. 6. These regulations shall be implemented after being discussed and decided by the bureau's affairs meeting and submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>

Representatives from the Administrative Education and Secondary Education Groups gathered in the auditorium to perform the ceremony as usual. Chairman Jin Zengcheng delivered a speech, stating that the most difficult thing for Guangdong education now is education funding. Due to the military expenses since the military uprising, the education funding cannot be paid. Secondly, the change in the cowhide tax rate by the Finance Department also affects education funding. As for education administration itself, the heads of education bureaus in various counties often fail to handle the official documents of the Education Department in a timely manner, and they also fail to report the amount of education funding that each bureau should increase, which hinders the preparation of the education funding budget by the Education Department. He hoped that everyone would pay attention to this point in the future. It was past 1:00 PM, and the meeting was adjourned (October 26).</p>

<h3 id="e130">Tongji Students Insist on Retaining President Hu <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully Submitted to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing: Previously, due to President Hu's resignation, the medical school presented a detailed petition to the Ministry, earnestly requesting his retention, which was approved under No. 526. Recently, it was suddenly rumored that President Hu's determination to leave was extremely firm and that the Ministry would appoint someone else to succeed him. Upon hearing this news, the students were extremely surprised. Recently, representatives specifically visited the President to express their concerns, fully understanding that the President's intention to leave was resolute. However, the students are deeply hopeful that President Hu can rescind his decision to leave and continue as President. This telegram is hastily written and does not fully express our feelings, so we are submitting it again for your consideration. Since President Hu took office, the school's affairs have been steadily improving. We are planning grand strategies for future development. If a change of personnel occurs midway, it will inevitably require starting anew, which is greatly detrimental to the school's progress. Consider that in European and Western countries, principals hold long-term positions; this is the principle. Furthermore, a university is the highest educational institution in a country, the source of specialized talent nationwide, and the focus of domestic and international attention. Someone without adequate qualifications and prestige cannot be entrusted with leading the school. The so-called qualified and prestigious individual must have a considerable position in the national academic community in terms of personal scholarship and morality to be able to lead the academic community and be qualified to lead a university without being a mere figurehead. This is one reason. A university president cannot be compared to a university professor. Even if scholarship and morality are adequate, experience in handling affairs is still necessary. Someone without maturity, stability, an age of over forty, and significant achievements in previously managing higher education cannot shoulder this important responsibility. This is another reason. Furthermore, Tongji University primarily focuses on medical and engineering schools and has a long history. Someone who cannot deeply understand the situation, thoroughly perceive the environment, and is proficient in German cannot cope adequately and achieve success. This is the third reason. The above only mentions the most important points. After careful consideration, the students believe that there is no suitable candidate other than President Hu in the country. The students are deeply concerned about the school's future and dare to sincerely express their concerns. We hope that the Ministry will listen to our heartfelt plea and earnestly retain President Hu to reassure the community. We are immensely anxious and await your response. Furthermore, rumors are circulating that a certain Mr. [omitted] will become the president, causing panic and consternation throughout the school. We believe that the Ministry, for the sake of the school's future, would not make such a decision. In haste and urgency, we await your instructions.</p>

<p>Jin Rong School, located at the eastern end of Kangti Road in the French Concession of this city, has been established for more than ten years. Its management is excellent, and it is very strict in training for various courses and the Boy Scout program. Therefore, its achievements are remarkable, and the number of students has increased to more than 500. However, because it is located in a commercial district, there are few opportunities for practice in the natural science course. Therefore, this morning, taking advantage of the weekend break, School Director Jin Liren, Dean of Studies Wu Shuzhen, and all the teachers led more than 60 senior Boy Scouts to Junhe Jing, the garden of the school's owner, Mr. Huang Jinrong, for on-site observation. Mr. Huang also provided lunch and personally provided guidance.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Four University Volleyball Tournament Soochow Wins Championship <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Two to One Victory Over Jinling</p>
<p>The result of the first day of the Four Universities Volleyball Championship was that Zhejiang University violated the rules and Shanghai University forfeited, and the situation gradually stabilized. Jinling itself also had the confidence to win the championship. The knowledge that what it planted was not what it harvested has made the championship go to Soochow with a ratio of two to one and won its fourth championship. Soochow has won its third consecutive championship, which seems to be lucky this time, but its strength is enough to be seen in East China. The process is as follows:</p>
<p>First Game Won By Jinling</p>
<p>Yesterday the weather was cloudy, but fortunately there was no rain. The audience was fascinated by the ball game. The more interesting it became, the more people gathered on the Tiangci Zhuang Road in the afternoon. It can be seen that ordinary people pay quite attention to one or two wins and losses. The game started at two and a half o'clock. The referee, Mr. Li Feiyun, blew the horn to summon the generals. Soochow served first. Zhu Zhilun's long shot was immediately returned by Jinling. Fortunately, the split down was weak and rescued into the enemy's camp to open the record. Zhu Sheng launched a fierce attack and won two more goals in a row. Then Jinling had a serving opportunity and delivered it back and forth. Team leader Yu Huanzi ambushed to save the dangerous situation and stretched his arms to suppress the battle, showing great magic and creating a 5-5 situation. Soochow's cheerleaders rose up to cheer. Jinling's lineup was very neat and well-organized. Tan Tianli stood alone, invincible. After coming and going, there was no easy game. From five to six to five to nine, Soochow attacked. When it was Zhao Congheng's turn to serve, the ball was like a pressure from the sky, which shocked Jinling. Jinling scored six consecutive points and reversed the situation to 11-9. After changing positions, Jinling's attack was still strong, and the momentum suddenly turned around, and they continued to score points and took the lead again. Finally, at the critical moment of life and death, they were tied at twenty to twenty and Jinling escaped the first game. Jinling won the first game with a score of 22 to 20, but it was also dangerous.</p>
<p>Second Game Won By Soochow</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second game, Jinling did not dare to underestimate Soochow, who had deep roots, and was very careful. After the opening ball, Soochow missed a shot and scored two consecutive points. At this time, Zhao Congheng from Soochow rose up and won four consecutive points. Zhou Zhaogang and Mei Jiaxiang worked hard to attack and also won four goals. In the first half, Soochow's situation was dominant with eleven to. After changing positions, Soochow scored eight points, while Jinling had no way to twist the split and only scored six points. As a result, Soochow won 21 to 12.</p>
<p>Third Game Won By Soochow</p>
<p>After the second game, the victory or defeat was not decided, so the game continued. In the third game, Jinling was very flat at the beginning. Soochow scored five consecutive points, the lineup was greatly disrupted, and the morale was scattered. They were in a slump. In the first half, Soochow took the lead with eleven to four. After changing positions, Soochow no longer worked hard, but the momentum had already been created, and Jinling could not recover. Yu Huanzi only called out in vain and only saw Soochow's rapid rise. As a result, Soochow won the championship with a score of 21 to 9 with a ratio of two to one.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Shanghai University Statement On Terminating The Match <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Athletic Guidance, Ni Xiaotong, specially sent a letter yesterday to clarify the facts regarding the termination of the match between Jinling and Shanghai University in the East China Four University Volleyball Championship. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, Today I read in your column on November 1st that there was "Shanghai University expressed opposition before the start of the second game and the game was not finished" in the East China Four University Volleyball Championship. This is not in line with the facts and I would like to request a correction. According to the East China Four University Sports Association Charter, if there is rain during a ball game, it may be postponed if both parties agree. If one party does not agree, the game must continue. When our school was playing volleyball against Jinling, it was already raining heavily. After the first game ended, the referee directly negotiated with the Jinling athletic guidance and players to stop the game. Afterwards, the referee and Jinling players left the court. Our school believed that since the first game had ended in the rain, the second game should naturally continue. Otherwise, before the start of the first game, the referee could have solicited the opinions of both parties to determine the proceedings. In addition, the referee did not solicit our school's opinion before leaving the seat, which was not the attitude that a referee should have. Our school tried hard to argue with him and wanted to continue the game, but the referee still insisted on stopping the game. Therefore, our school could not tolerate this violation of the charter and decided to withdraw from the game. As for the report that Jinling wanted to continue and Shanghai University objected, it is too far from the truth. The facts are all there and cannot be fabricated. Please correct it immediately for the sake of virtue. Sincerely, Ni Xiaotong, Shanghai University Athletic Guidance, November 1st</p>

Each team in Group A will compete twice against each other, while Group B will compete once.

<p>The commerce that the state recognizes and should develop in cooperation with the people broadly includes two types: one is domestic commerce, and the other is foreign commerce. Domestic commerce has the same ethnic customs, laws, taxes, credit affairs, educational system, and so on. When the national politics are good and various production industries are developed, domestic commerce tends to promote those areas with better production and coerce those with inferior production to improve. Both tend towards areas with superior living conditions, so the national, social, and people's livelihoods, finance, material culture, and functions are not only not harmed by this development, but can also be promoted to a higher level. However, foreign commerce, in areas different from one's own country, is different.</p>
<p>Since the advent of world international trade, the livelihood policy of foreign commerce has occupied a special position. The powers of the East and West have almost used the power of the whole country to support their foreign policies because their domestic population has increased, industry has developed, and production has been excessive, making it impossible to match the ordinary progress of the people's livelihood. They have had to find other markets abroad or, due to a lack of raw materials, have had to rely on other countries and transport industrial products in exchange in order to meet the national balance of income and expenditure and seek a surplus in their budget. Therefore, foreign commerce should not be observed as a business of buying and selling goods, but only by observing how the facts of foreign goods entering and domestic goods leaving affect the entire domestic people's livelihood production. The state's foreign trade has claims, such as exports of goods whose value exceeds the value of imports, which is called export exceeding, also known as the balance of payment surplus. The state's foreign commerce has an import value greater than exports, which is called import exceeding, also known as the balance of payment deficit. The more a country wants to retain and increase its common wealth domestically, the more it should attach importance to foreign commerce, comparing the import and export of goods. If there is a deficit in the balance, money flows out and wealth decreases, it is considered a great danger to the national economy and people's livelihood. For this reason, the importance of foreign commerce is more obvious than that of domestic commerce. Colbert's argument that the interests of foreign commerce are national interests is still supported by political scholars and they are unwilling to abandon it. According to customs reports, China's imports of foreign goods are increasing year by year. The impact of the increase in foreign goods has greatly changed the historical allocation of labor and capital used in domestic production industries, resulting in domestic production and business being increasingly suppressed. Except for the introduction and transportation agency of foreign goods, there is no commerce to speak of. If we want to solve the problem of revitalizing national commerce, the livelihood policy of foreign commerce is very different from the policy that should be implemented for domestic commerce. In the latter, the most important issue is the cooperation between labor and capital in industry and commerce, and price adjustment is the design of producers and consumers, such as whether the organizational form of commerce and the dependency relationship of the national livelihood should be concentrated in large stores and exchanges, whether consumer cooperative enterprises should be favored, and whether the safety of the current situation of small merchants should be taken into account. Should fixed commerce and itinerant commerce be treated differently? What is the most appropriate form of commercial enterprise and trading method? If the direction and implementation policies are determined, the state will not have to worry. However, foreign commerce changes with the international environment. First, we must understand the quantity and types of imports from foreign countries and exports from our own country, and then establish precise plans to regulate foreign trade. On the one hand, we must promote domestic production to the greatest extent, and on the other hand, we must reduce the competitive power of foreign goods against domestic goods. In particular, we must pay attention to industrial products, using tariff protection policies, subsidies, or prohibiting the export of domestic raw materials to make foreign goods expensive and domestic goods cheap. In addition, domestic transportation should be improved to ensure that the transportation of commercial goods is fast and efficient. This will increase domestic production and ensure that industry and commerce have good production conditions. In addition to these measures, if domestic production is considered to be related to the people's livelihood, a complete system that does not support or promote it, or uses national financial resources to promote domestic industry and prevent foreign competition, then the impact of foreign commerce on domestic commerce will be great. Even if it cannot quickly reach a superior international position, the balance of payments can be maintained.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Hopes for the Conference (Li Quanshi) <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>This time, the National Government's Ministry of Industry and Commerce convened the Industrial and Commercial Conference to vigorously implement industrial and commercial policies, promote the development of production, foreign trade, and increase the national economy. It is indeed a microcosm of a national economic conference, because except for agriculture, industry, mining, fisheries, transportation, and other matters not within the scope of discussion, the rest, such as matters concerning the relief of national unemployment, matters concerning industrial relief, matters concerning international trade, matters concerning industrial, commercial, and financial matters, matters concerning the concentration of capital and the use of foreign capital to develop industry, matters concerning labor welfare and labor-capital disputes, matters concerning scientific management, matters concerning commercial taxes, matters concerning industrial raw materials, matters concerning the promotion and protection of domestic goods, matters concerning the improvement of state-owned products, and matters concerning basic industries, etc., are all included in the major matters that are closely related to the national economy.</p>
<p>Since the scope of discussion planned for the Industrial and Commercial Conference is so broad, the importance of its responsibility can be imagined.</p>
<p>It is heard that the ministry has already received more than two hundred proposals, so the urgency and complexity of its affairs can be imagined. I, as a member of the experts, hope that all the members attending the meeting will select one or two groups according to their own expertise, carefully review the proposals belonging to each group, spread public opinion, and formulate complete and meticulous plans for submission to the general assembly for a public decision. The general assembly should especially avoid making speeches that fill the hall without much conclusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the general assembly of members has made public decisions on various proposals, the power to implement them rests with the government. However, we hope that after the government has gathered ideas and formulated plans, it should not only hear the sound but not see the facts. As the saying goes, governing is not about talking too much. We only hope that the industrial and commercial authorities can muster a spirit of fearlessness to relieve the people from their suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Paying Respects at the Mausoleum <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>

After the members arrived at the mausoleum, they went up the steps, first signed their names at the signing place on the left side of the sacrificial hall, then visited the stone statue and the mausoleum road, and after the visit, they retreated to the sacrificial hall and stood solemnly in front of the stone statue. At 9:00 a.m., they performed the ceremony, the procedure of which was: (1) Standing solemnly; (2) Chairman Kong Xiangxi presented flowers; (3) Music was played; (4) All members bowed three times; (5) Music was played; (6) The ceremony was completed. After the members performed the ceremony, they dispersed and took a group photo on the stone steps in front of the tomb to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Telegram Urged Wang Yansong and Others to Strive for It</p>
<p>Shanghai Intestine Industry, Egg Industry, Shoe Industry, Cotton Fluffing Industry, Fruit and Local Goods Industry, Domestic Pigment Miscellaneous Goods Industry, Sauce and Wine Industry, Cosmetics Industry, Western-Style Wooden Furniture Industry, Cured Meat Industry, Transportation Industry, Miscellaneous Retail Industry, Chinese Woolen Fabric Factory Industry, Spring Chair Industry, Pawnshop Industry, Chinese Soap Industry, Material Bottle Industry, Wood Industry Explosives Industry, Steel and Tin Industry, Chinese Candle Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Duck Slaughtering Industry, Pollen Industry, Tea Food Industry, Hotel Industry, Candle Industry, Ice Factory Industry, Shoe Leather Nail Industry, Western Pigment Industry, Brass Woodworking Industry, Pen Measurement Industry, North-South Goods Demolition Industry, Liang Shaoxing Wine Industry, Noodle Industry, Tooth Bone Ware Industry, Timber Industry, Straw Hat Industry, North Goods Industry, Longan Industry, Hat Shop Industry, Fresh Meat Industry, Rickshaw Industry, Paper Industry, Sand Boat Number Industry, Oil Hemp Industry, Chinese Medicine Industry, Flying Flower Industry, New Medicine Industry, Gauze Number Industry, Chicken and Duck Industry, [Blank] Industry, Fresh Pig Industry, Restaurant Industry, Staple Binding Industry, Comb [Blank] Industry, Bamboo Industry, Advertising Industry, Medicinal Material Industry, Western-Style Flower Board Chair Industry, Seafood Grocery Industry, South Goods Industry, Postal Transportation Industry, Rice Number Industry, Clothing Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Paint Industry, Ham Industry, Brick Ash Industry, Sugar Industry, Color Printing Industry, Sauce Garden Industry, Ginseng Bird's Nest Industry, Tobacco Exchange Industry, Parasol Industry, etc., more than eighty trade associations, because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong has always been concerned about the situation of various industries, and Wang is also a member hired for this National Industrial and Commercial Conference opened in Beijing. Yesterday, Wang was specially telegraphed to strive for the issue of trade regulations. The text said: "To Wang Yansong, member of the National Industrial and Commercial Conference Secretariat in Nanjing: I have learned that since the Shanghai Municipal Business Transport was led by you, all the past complicated organizations have been reorganized into trade associations in accordance with laws and regulations. The great achievement of unification is truly a grand event for all ages. Every time I think about it, I am deeply respectful. The responsibility of the trade association, according to the laws and regulations, is to maintain and promote the common interests of the industry and to correct the malpractices of the business. However, the promotion of public welfare must have its methods of promotion, and the correction of malpractices must have its tools of correction. What are these methods and tools? They are the trade regulations formulated by the trade associations with reference to the habits of the industry. However, these formulated trade regulations must be observed by all members inside and outside the association in order to take effect. Otherwise, not only will the trade association be unable to fulfill its declared responsibilities, but also China's commerce will never have any hope of improvement. Therefore, since the newspaper reported that 'the Ministry of Industry and Commerce discussed and rejected the resolution of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Members' Congress that the trade regulations submitted by the trade associations for approval should be regarded as special regulations formulated by the official authorities for the industry, and all industries that have not joined the association should also abide by them,' everyone has been terrified, telling each other and appealing to reconsider. In Shanghai, I have been honored to have been seen twice by Mr. and have agreed to provide assistance with great enthusiasm and deep admiration. Now that the National Industrial and Commercial Conference has opened and Mr. is invited to attend, I urge you to hold firmly, submit the reconsideration, and also ask Yu Hede, Xu Jiyin, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, and Fang Jiaobo to strive together to achieve the goal. I think that the discussing officials are all outstanding talents of the time. For the issue of trade regulations that is equally important to the unified commercial operation, they will certainly maintain the original intention of Fu Que businessmen and people."</p>
<p>Sheng Shenjue deeply believes that whether the industrial and commercial undertakings of our country can grow and prosper from this and open up a new beginning will be determined by the results of this conference. In addition to happiness, I really cannot express my infinite prayer.</p>
<p>The establishment of the foundation of industrial and commercial enterprises in any country in the world and the degree of its continued growth are all determined by the industrial and commercial policies decided by the government, and the industrial and commercial policies adopted by any government are determined by whether the domestic industrial and commercial groups can cooperate with the government to determine their success or failure. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Xiangxi first proposed the two meanings of official-civilian cooperation and labor-capital coordination as the standard for future political implementation, because the government and the people are one, and their pain and prosperity are closely related. If the government is the government and the people are the people, not only will industry and commerce not be improved, but also the future of the country will not be able to achieve stability.</p>
<p>Xiangxi has the talent but heavy responsibility, and at times is worried about accidents. However, today is the difficult time for the country's creation, and the responsibility for the protection and promotion of industry and commerce lies in the responsibility. Therefore, following the General Manager's Principle of People's Livelihood, based on the party's program, examining the current social situation and industrial and commercial conditions, the outline of industrial and commercial administration and the work plan during the training period have been determined and implemented in sequence. Among the important ones are: (1) Soliciting industrial and commercial opinions and arbitrarily formulating industrial and commercial laws and regulations in order to adapt to the social situation; (2) Consulting with the competent authorities to consider the current industrial and commercial situation and jointly revise tariffs to protect fledgling industries; (3) Establishing the Central Industrial Inspection Institute and the Bureau of Weights and Measures to gradually realize the standardization of industry and commerce; (4) Establishing the Commodity Inspection Bureau and the Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau to improve the quality of domestic goods and pay attention to foreign publicity in order to increase the credit of foreign trade; (5) Establishing the China National Products Exhibition and organizing the China National Products Bank to cultivate the people's habit of loving and using domestic goods and to support the development of domestic goods production institutions. All of these are actively carried out within the limits of talent and economic capacity, but they have not made long-term progress due to environmental limitations. Regarding the international aspect, in order to seek international cooperation, exchange industrial and commercial knowledge, and promote domestic industrial and commercial progress, representatives have been selected to attend the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Raw Silk Conference, and the International Labor Conference. Recently, it has been proposed to the National Government to establish a currency standard to relieve the panic of expensive gold and cheap silver, and to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes to seek the reform of the commercial tax system and improve the transportation organization in order to eliminate the obstacles to industrial and commercial development. However, industrial and commercial construction is complicated and requires gathering ideas and wisdom. I hope that the scholars will come forward. The previous two committees of the Ministry, the Industrial and Commercial Design and the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations, have already received the assistance of industrial leaders, economic scholars, and legal experts, and have made many plans. This time, the military is over and peace is seen again, and the National Industrial and Commercial Conference that Xiangxi expected in his inaugural declaration is also held at this time. It is the first time that the central government of the National Government has made up its mind to support our industrial and commercial circles, and it is also a plan to get rid of the old and establish the new, cooperate with the people to establish a century-old plan, and seek the prosperity of the national economic construction. It is also the beginning of the active cooperation between the government and the industrial and commercial circles. The beginning of the power of the people. I would like to mention a few points for discussion: One is to consolidate industry, commerce, and finance. The reasons for the insufficient development of industry, commerce, and finance in our country are indeed very complicated. The lack of funds, the high interest rate, the lack of investment protection, and the chaotic currency system in various provinces are indescribable. The excessive rise and fall of the exchange rate of gold and silver are also among the most important. From now on, how should we establish a currency standard, consolidate industry, commerce, and finance, and how should we protect the rights and interests of Chinese and foreign investment, and retreat from the general speculative frenzy, will be the responsibility of those who are concerned about industrial and financial affairs to carefully consider and properly plan for the future. The responsibility lies with the industrial and commercial community, and I hope that they will carefully discuss it. This is the cure for the disease. The second is to collaborate on industrial construction. Industry is more important than commerce in safeguarding the national economy and the people's livelihood. The basic industries that our country urgently needs at present, the Ministry has prepared a plan and presented it to the National Government to give priority to the establishment of fine yarn, woolen weaving, triacid, and sugar factories to show promotion. I hope that we can work together to see its success as soon as possible. The third is to improve industrial and commercial organizations. Commercial groups in our country have gradually been reorganized, and labor groups have also been reorganized in accordance with the law. However, the reorganization is not in its name but in its essence. The future direction should be to follow the party's program to refresh the spirit and organization, and to refer to the practices of Europe and the United States to pay attention to investigation and research so that industrialists and businessmen can gradually develop according to their basis. At present, the labor-capital dispute, which is regarded by all sectors of society as a major reef in industrial development, can also be easily and appropriately resolved scientifically, benefiting both parties. The fourth is to promote scientific management. In the past, commercial types in our country were all sticking to conventions and standing still, while industry was still in its infancy and formed its own atmosphere. The violation of scientific principles in its management methods cannot be overstated. In May of this year, Xiangxi and his colleagues initiated the organization of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association to promote scientific management, improve production efficiency, and realize the Principle of People's Livelihood as the only goal. Although the scale has been established, the promotion of interests cannot be achieved overnight. The fifth day is to revitalize</p>

<h3 id="e157">The Grand Opening Ceremony Yesterday (Taken by Nanjing Guanghua) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Inherent national products. Our country is rich in natural resources, and inherent specialties are also numerous. However, either the production volume is too small to meet the needs of society, or the quality is uneven and cannot meet foreign standards. It should be rectified and remedied by promoting mergers and operations and carrying out large-scale production as the fundamental plan. The sixth day is to develop foreign trade. Our country has seen more and more people surpass us in the past twenty years, and the silk, tea, tung oil, soybean, and other special products that occupy the most important position in export trade have been stifled by the fierce competition from foreign countries, and there is a great tendency to move forward and retreat and to grow and diminish. As a result, clothing, food, housing, and transportation are almost all dependent on foreigners, and the economic difficulties are frightening. In order to save the situation, the fundamental plan is to persuade the implementation of protective tariffs and reward export policies. However, the organization of the International Trade Commission and the National Export Trade Association is also an urgent task. I hope that we will strive to fight and turn defeat into victory.</p>
<p>As for what the commercial community in our country should pay more attention to in psychological construction, there are two points: One is to preserve the inherent virtues and establish industrial and commercial integrity. The old customs of our country have always valued integrity, and once a word is spoken, it will not change for a long time. The credit of Chinese merchants is recognized by foreigners, that is, the beautiful relationship is also due to the fact that other countries value profits. The late General Manager deeply regretted that the restoration of inherent virtues was emphasized, and the meaning was precisely here. On the second day, we should absorb new industrial and commercial knowledge and strive for international friendship. In this era of scientific omnipotence, the industrial and commercial progress of European and American countries is almost a thousand miles a day. The backwardness of industry in our country is undeniable. From now on, we should allow the absorption of new knowledge and strive to improve. Only we must not be self-satisfied and deeply closed and refuse. We still hope to go further and encourage the industrialists and businessmen of various countries to grind each other.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief outline of Xiangxi's feelings. The participants are all experts and hold the same vision. I hope that on the one hand, they will express their knowledge and experience and contribute as much as possible to the construction plan of the industrial and commercial undertakings of our country for the government to adopt. On the other hand, they will examine the needs of various industries and contact them to carry out the work in order to overcome the current difficulties and strive for the actual cooperation between the government and businessmen and between businessmen and businessmen. The industrial and commercial undertakings are deeply dependent on it, and the bright future of the party and the country will also be determined by the success of this conference.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Chairman Jiang's Instructions <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>丨Develop Industry and Commerce丨Utilize Foreign Capital丨</p>
<p>Today, the National Industrial and Commercial Conference opens, and it is the time when the military affairs have ended and the unification has been completed. The chief officials in charge of industrial and commercial administration in various provinces and cities and economic experts from all over the country, as well as industrial and commercial leaders from home and abroad, have gathered together with a spirit of hard work to create a precedent for cooperation between officials and civilians. It is an unprecedented event in the industrial and commercial community. In addition to being happy, Zhongzheng cannot help but say a word to punish you.</p>
<p>Our party has inherited the General Manager's instructions, investigated the national situation, and issued declarations at the past national congresses and the Central Executive Committee, all of which have focused on protecting industry and commerce, developing the economy, and promoting the people's livelihood as the goal. This should be seen and heard by all the participants. Our country is vast and rich in resources, and its workers are hardworking and thrifty. Commerce has always valued integrity and is recognized by the world. However, the remnant warlords have repeatedly rebelled, and the bandits and communists in various places have taken the opportunity to make troubles, which has led to many misfortunes in the country and hindered the progress of construction. Now that the rebellion has been successfully suppressed and order has been gradually established, it is appropriate to gather the strength of the whole country to seek the progress of industry and commerce to benefit the people's livelihood, and the foundation of the country depends on the government and the people working together to strive for rapid progress. From the perspective of responsibility, it is the responsibility of the government to eliminate obstacles with negative policies and to promote and encourage with positive policies. However, the development of industry and commerce cannot be achieved solely by the government's strength, and its foundation lies in the industrial and commercial community itself. How to improve products, how to refine technology, how to promote sales, how to maintain inherent integrity, and how to develop natural resources are the issues that the industrial and commercial community must strive to do. How to strengthen the group, how to coordinate labor and capital, how to circulate finance, how to compete in foreign trade, and how to adapt domestic supply and demand are the issues that the industrial and commercial community must strive to help each other. If, in view of the fact that our country's science is young and capital is lacking, how should we import foreign capital for use under the principle of equality and mutual benefit in order to increase production and extend the use of foreign experts to take charge of technology? This is also what the General Manager has shown in his instructions and what we can follow. As for the participants, all of you are the backbone of the industrial and commercial community and have the responsibility to assist the government in implementing industrial and commercial policies. You also have the position of guiding and supervising the general public. I hope that you will express your opinions, discuss them in detail, determine the plan, and look forward to implementing it together to establish the foundation of the economy and bring the people's livelihood to prosperity, then the holding of this conference will not be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Sun Ke, Representative of the Central Party Headquarters <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>丨Support the Kuomintang丨Engage in Economic Construction</p>
<p>Sun Ke's address briefly stated that he was very honored that the Industrial and Commercial Conference was opened today and that experts from all over the country were gathered together. However, in addition to being happy, he also had a few feelings. Now that the country is unified and the military affairs have ended, we should strive to engage in construction. The most important point of the proposal is to develop the economy. Only when the national economy develops can the country develop and make progress. The industrial and commercial community throughout the country should work together to support the government's plan. All the difficult problems encountered by the government and the industrial and commercial community in economic construction are hoped to be resolved in this conference. If specific measures are discussed, they can be implemented. General Jiang Kai's victory once generated a feeling about party affairs, but since the Northern Expedition of the party from Guangdong, reactionary warlords have always tried to resist. Therefore, the party affairs have not been reorganized and have not been completely satisfactory. This is inevitable, but the party's two enemies are the warlords and the communists. If we do not support the Kuomintang, we will either go to the warlords or the communists. This is how dangerous it is. Therefore, seeking national stability and economic development can only be achieved by supporting the Kuomintang to lead the country and supporting the Kuomintang to build. It is even more important not to hate the Kuomintang. Behind the communists is the Third International. Russia, during the imperial system, always thought of invading China. Now it is propagating communism, which is still a disguised method of invasion. The Chinese people should not be fooled by it. The points mentioned by Minister Kong Fang are all the key points for today's economic construction and the development of industry and commerce. I hope that all the participants will have detailed research and achieve extremely satisfactory results. I wish the Industrial and Commercial Conference will pass all the resolutions and see them implemented in the future, and I wish you all good health.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Speech by National Government Representative Wang Chonghui <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>丨Emphasis on Industry and Commerce丨Not Just Lip Service丨</p>
<p>I am very honored to represent the National Government at this grand gathering. There are many reasons for the underdevelopment of industry and commerce in China. Besides material reasons, spiritual reasons are particularly important. Historically, China has placed industry and commerce after scholars and farmers. Examination methods were used to encourage scholars, and prayers were used to develop agriculture. However, industry and commerce were looked down upon, and this concept has been around for a long time, resulting in the current backward situation of industry and commerce. The so-called "industry" and "commerce" of the past are not the same as today's. Since the invention of machinery in the last hundred years, industry and commerce have been very different from the past. Because in the past we emphasized industry and commerce, reactionary elements could destroy it at any time. Today's emphasis on industry and commerce is not just lip service, but also to reform the long-standing habits of industry and commerce and to eliminate the obstacles to the development of industry and commerce. Premier Sun Yat-sen, in his busy schedule, drafted an industrial plan to promote the development of industry and commerce. The Premier said in this plan that if the power to develop industry and commerce is not developed automatically, and if the power of development is in the hands of others, then China will perish. Therefore, the existence of the power to develop industry is very important to the survival of the country. The goal of this conference is about four things: (1) to promote industrial and commercial policies; (2) to develop foreign trade; (3) to develop commercial enterprises; (4) to promote national economic power. Today, the members present are either commercial leaders or experts and representatives from various provinces and cities. In the future, they will definitely work hard to realize a new era of industry and commerce in accordance with the purpose of the conference, creating a new era of cooperation between the national industrial and commercial circles and the government.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Researching the National Calendar for Closing Accounts <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Approved the Process of Staggered Methods</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has Specially Formed a Specialized Committee to Review</p>
<p>Proposing to Take the Day Before Lichun as the Final Closing Date</p>
<p>Closing accounts according to the national calendar is a matter of great concern to the society. Its relationship is not only in the business community, but also with the general public. The reporter of the New Voice Society stated that the staggered method of closing accounts according to the national calendar was originally decided by the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee and then presented to the government for approval and implementation. This year, the industries felt the difficulty of its implementation, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also accepted the research and formed a special committee to review it. Therefore, this reporter specially visited Mr. Yan E, the secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to explain in detail the process of this case as follows:</p>
<p>The original letter of review regarding the national calendar for closing accounts: According to the national calendar for closing accounts, the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee for review on September 9th of last year. The original letter stated: "From next year (i.e., the 19th year) onwards, the annual staggered collection of accounts should be in accordance with the calculation of the solar calendar, or according to the solar terms, the year before and after should be appropriately divided into several periods, and it must be for the purpose of abolishing the lunar calendar. Please inform your association to check and refer to the above methods, examine the commercial situation, participate in opinions, and formulate this year's (18th year) unified closing date and the staggered method of collecting accounts from next year onwards, so as to prepare for adoption and shelving the case in anticipation of speedy implementation." According to the original letter from the Social Bureau, there are two methods: one is staggered periods and the other is according to the solar terms. Its sole purpose is to abolish the lunar calendar and abide by the national calendar.</p>
<p>The situation of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee's review: After receiving the above letter from the Social Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee first conducted a detailed study by the Standing Committee, and then submitted it to the eighth plenary meeting on September 30 for discussion. It was decided that the promotion of the national calendar and the abolition of the lunar calendar should be unanimously observed in accordance with the government's order. However, the closing of accounts by lunar calendar in the business community was originally divided into three periods a year, and the end of the year was the major closing. If the number of closing periods is increased, the period will be short and the implementation will be difficult. If the number of periods is reduced, the economic circulation will be difficult. In order to facilitate the facts of all parties, it is still appropriate to close accounts in three periods a year. As for the staggered method, our country is based on agriculture, and we must take into account the harvest season of farmers. It is found that the end of May in the national calendar is the time for silkworms and barley to appear, and September is the time for rice to ripen. If the end of May and the end of September of the national calendar are used as the closing dates for the business community, there will be little obstacle in the implementation. It is still appropriate to use the end of December of the national calendar as the major closing date, etc. After the discussion, the three committee members, Wang Yansong, Bei Songsun, and Qin Runqing, were first recommended to contact the Social Bureau, and it was deemed feasible before the official letter was replied to the Social Bureau on October 4.</p>
<p>Various opinions during the review: When the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee reviewed this case, although some members of the consolidation committee advocated setting another commercial calendar, the majority of the committee members believed that since there was a determination to implement the national calendar, there should be no concerns first. If it is resolutely decided and it is indeed difficult to pass in fact during the first session, the government can also clearly understand that it is not that merchants are complacent and unwilling to reform, or perhaps other flexible methods can be set. At that time, the Nanjing Municipal Social Bureau also sent a letter to solicit the opinion of the Nanjing General Chamber of Commerce on the method of closing accounts according to the national calendar from the 19th year onwards. After discussion, the Beijing Chamber of Commerce believed that the three periods of May, August, and the end of the year of the national calendar were satisfactory as the closing periods and sent a letter to the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau for submission to the Beijing Municipal Government for submission to the National Government for record. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee decided on this three-period method because the opinions of the Beijing and Shanghai Chambers of Commerce were consistent on the national calendar's year-end closing period.</p>
<p>The process of the National Government's approval and notification: After receiving the letter from the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau submitted it to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government believed that the proposed reform of the closing date method was still detailed and asked the Executive Yuan for instructions. The Executive Yuan also ordered the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to review and reply. Afterwards, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied that it was in line with the central laws and commercial customs and that the proposed method could be approved so that the national closing date could be unified and the old calendar could be fundamentally resolved. It was replied to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan re-examined and found no differences and submitted it to the National Government for review and filing. In addition to asking the National Government to issue a notice to the whole country to comply with it, the Shanghai Municipal Government was ordered to forward the notice to the Social Bureau and reply to the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee. The letter stated: "However, from the 19th year onwards, the staggered method proposed must be strictly followed for closing accounts." At the same time, the Municipal Party Department and the Special Zone Provisional Court forwarded the notice to the association, and the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee distributed letters to all trade associations and published announcements in newspapers to inform them. Afterwards, if local chambers of commerce sent letters to inquire, the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee would immediately record the letters and reply to them.</p>
<p>The promotion of the national calendar for closing accounts this year: Since the official establishment of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it has been working hard to implement the national calendar for closing accounts. Before the end of May and the end of September for closing accounts, it will first publish announcements in newspapers to enable merchants in the city to comply at the time. The Money Industry Association, the Coal Industry Association, the Silk Industry Association, and other associations also published announcements in newspapers to remind their members to pay attention and comply. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also closed its office for one day at the end of May and September to draw the attention of merchants. After the end of September, the Money Industry Association published announcements in newspapers stating that the national calendar year-end closing was approaching, hoping that all industries would prepare in advance. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also decided at the fourth executive committee meeting to publish announcements in various newspapers in the city and send letters to all trade associations in the city to prepare for the national calendar year-end closing to show its determination to comply with the national calendar. Each party stated the situation of hardship: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce first received a letter from the Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce on a certain day of a certain month stating that there might be difficulties in the national calendar year-end closing this year and requesting the government to specially approve a flexible extension of one and a half months to solicit consent. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss that the extension of one month last year due to insufficient preparation was originally a temporary transitional measure. This year is the second year of implementing the national calendar, and merchants have long heard about it, and it seems inappropriate to change the method of closing accounts at the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December, etc. However, at that time, the Qianye Association of six counties in Jiangsu Province, including Jiangning, Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, Danyang, and Zhenjiang, sent representatives to Wuxi to hold a meeting. Because of the difficulty in implementing the year-end closing of accounts, they decided to request the establishment of a commercial and civil accounting year, with the end of January of the national calendar as the major closing date. At the same time, representatives of chambers of commerce in various counties in Jiangsu also held a meeting in Zhenjiang and unanimously approved the proposal of the Qianye Association of six counties to request the establishment of a commercial and civil accounting year, and added the opinion that the deadline for collecting grain silver in each county should be extended from the end of December to the complete end of February 15 of the national calendar so as to take care of the facts and avoid difficulties. The Qianye Association of six counties and the representatives of the chambers of commerce of 39 counties jointly submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for filing. At the same time, the soybean and rice industry, fresh pork industry, pollen industry, ginseng and bird's nest industry, fruit and local goods industry, hat industry, transfer and customs declaration industry, new medicine industry, and silk and satin industry in this city all stated the various difficulties in the practical situation of closing accounts at the end of the year in accordance with the national calendar, hoping that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce would collect the opinions of various industries and submit them to the government for modification.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Specially Forms a Review Committee: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the fact that various parties have requested and realized that the commercial situation really needs to be reconsidered, submitted the entire case to the fifth executive committee for detailed study. The committee members present on that day included Ye Huijun, Luo Qinghua, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Fengzhu, Lu Wenshao, Xu Jiyi, Zhu Yinjiang, Wu Zhonghao, Shen Lanting, Lu Qisheng, Lao Jingxiu, and other 14 people, who all expressed detailed opinions on this case. After discussion, it was believed that this case was of great importance to commerce and that a special committee should be formed to collect opinions from all parties to study and properly handle it. Zhu Yinjiang, Lu Wenshao, Luo Qinghua, Wang Yansong, and Xu Jiyi were immediately appointed as members of the special committee. The special committee convened a meeting at 2:00 PM on October 30. After review and research, it was believed that since closing accounts in accordance with the national calendar was the only principle that had already been decided, there could be no changes, but there should be room for requesting modification as to which day of the national calendar could actually be implemented in the business community. It was found that our country is based on agriculture and the national economy is related to agricultural harvests. The Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee decided to use the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December as the closing periods, but there were two shortcomings: (1) The end of May and the end of September both took into account agricultural harvests in the original letter from the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee to the Social Bureau, but the end of December's major closing period did not pay attention; (2) If the end of December is used as the final closing period, then the closing dates for the second closing date will be five months from January 1 to the end of May, the second will be four months from June 1 to the end of September, and the third will be only three months from October 1 to the end of December. This 5, 4, 3 method is too uneven. Although the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee had this method at the time, its purpose was to resolutely promote the national calendar and it had its own special intentions. However, now that there are difficulties that cannot be solved in fact, it is of course necessary to seek remedies. In order to remedy this difficulty in fact, it is proposed to refer to the letter from the former Social Bureau to the Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee and modify the method of dividing the periods according to the solar terms, with the day before Lichun as the final closing period for the business community every year. The reasons are: (1) The Lichun climate is calculated according to the solar calendar and there is no suspicion of using the lunar calendar; (2) Lichun is always on February 4th of the national calendar every year, and even if there are changes, it will be on February 5th, with a difference of only one day, and the dates can be calculated and determined; (3) Before Lichun, the agricultural harvests have long been completed and the income of farmers has been converted into cash. There are no problems with collecting accounts and paying payments in cities and towns; (4) If February 4 is set as the final closing period, then the three closing periods can make up for the too short third period with the too long first period, which is more even. It is heard that the committee members researched repeatedly and all believed that it was appropriate, and it was decided to report to the Executive Committee for discussion and approval before submitting it to the government for filing.</p>

<p>More than one million yuan has been collected since the collection began</p>
<p>Landlords in the Chinese area request to stop collecting</p>
<p>The landlords in the Chinese area of this city, Pan Peide, and others, have repeatedly submitted petitions to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and other agencies regarding the collection of rent, requesting that the collection stop when one million yuan has been collected. Yesterday, they jointly sent a telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the case be investigated and the Shanghai Municipal Government be ordered to immediately stop the collection in order to show credibility. The original telegram is excerpted as follows (omitted above): The Shanghai Municipal Government was ordered to raise one million yuan in short-term treasury bonds of the 19th year's customs duties and borrow and collect rent. It is heard that since the collection began on September 30 and ended on October 29, it has only been one month and more than one million yuan has been collected. If the loan is collected for two months according to the original plan, the excess will be more than doubled, and the people's strength will be unbearable. It is urgent to appeal (omitted) for the approval of the investigation and ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government to announce the amount collected and quickly stop the collection. We are eagerly waiting for orders.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Special Tax Cargo Ship Runs Aground on the Upper Yangtze and is Robbed <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Entire Ship of Special Goods Looted</p>
<p>Losses Reach Hundreds of Thousands of Gold</p>
<p>Now Being Transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships</p>
<p>The Special Tax Bureau in Lianghu has a special bureau for open transportation. Each month, there are two shipments from Sichuan to Wuhan for public collection</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The special tax is levied under the guise of prohibition and prevents the malpractices of smuggling by unscrupulous merchants. It is reported that recently, the ship carrying this cargo suddenly had an accident en route, and all the goods were stolen, resulting in losses of hundreds of thousands of gold. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now dispatched ships to transport the goods. The details of this incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Amount of Special Goods Transported to Wuhan: Since the establishment of the Special Tax Bureau, the amount of special goods from Sichuan imported into Lianghu has been limited. The director of the bureau, Li Muqing, agreed with the cargo owners in Sichuan to set a monthly limit of 1,000 tons, divided into two shipments, each carrying 500 tons, which means a total of 16,800 dan per month. Within this limit, the bureau issues stickers with the seal of the Lianghu Special Tax Bureau to indicate publicly taxed goods. Goods without this special stamp are subject to detention and heavy fines. The ship carrying the goods is also dispatched by the bureau to ensure caution, and an armed guard platoon is assigned to the ship to provide security.</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Runs Aground: The ship dispatched by the Special Tax Bureau to transport the goods, called the "Shudu", has a capacity of only 500 tons. On this occasion, it was fully loaded with special goods in Yichang. When it reached a place called Tiaocheng, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was shallow. The ship's draft was heavy, and it ran aground on a shoal in the river due to careless navigation. The ship was stuck in the sand and mud, unable to move. Unexpectedly, after running aground, a robbery occurred.</p>
<p>Special Tax Goods Stolen: This year, there have been more bandits on the upper Yangtze River than in previous years. The road is not peaceful. Communist bandits and other bandits are everywhere, specializing in robbing merchant ships. After the "Shudu" ran aground, it was about to report to Wuhan for help, but the bandits learned that there were not many guards on board. They gathered a gang on boats and attacked the ship. The armed guards on the cargo ship resisted, but the bandits were more numerous and their weapons were confiscated. Then, all the special tax goods on the ship were looted. When troops were dispatched from Wuhan to rescue the ship, the bandits had already fled with their loot. It is reported that several crew members and guards were injured by the bandits.</p>
<p>"Kuailli" Ship Transport: After this incident, Director Li Muqing and the Sichuan cargo owners repeatedly discussed measures to pursue the bandits and deal with the aftermath. In addition to requesting the Wuhan Garrison Command to send troops to suppress the bandits and recover the stolen goods, they decided to meet the demands of the Sichuan cargo owners and dispatch larger ships for future transport. However, it was impossible to rent large ships on the upper Yangtze River for the time being. Therefore, Li Muqing negotiated with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai to rent a Yangtze River ship to carry the special goods. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the Wuhan director to discuss the arrangements with Li Muqing: (1) In order to ensure tax revenue, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will allocate the "Kuailli" ship to carry the special goods. However, the "Kuailli" ship cannot be fully allocated. Only 5/10 of the ship's capacity will be reserved for special tax goods per trip, and the rest will be used to carry commercial goods. (2) The water freight for the special tax goods from Yichang to Wuhan will be 6.5 taels of silver per dan. (3) The guards stationed on the ship will be appointed by the Special Tax Bureau, and the required food and salaries will be borne by the Special Tax Bureau. It is reported that the above arrangements have been agreed upon by both parties, and the contract will be signed and implemented soon. As for the grounded "Shudu" ship, the Special Tax Bureau will send another tugboat to rescue it.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Song's Letter to General Commander Chiang</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen wrote to General Commander Chiang, stating that the original customs anti-smuggling teams under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance have been established since the late Qing Dynasty. All officers and soldiers were either reorganized from the remnants of the military or recruited from drifters with no military training or service knowledge. Their monthly salaries were also extremely meager, so the chiefs in various places regarded encroachment on quotas and private collection of loopholes as normal, and the soldiers relied on covering up private loopholes to supplement their tax revenue. Not only could they not protect the revenue, but they also eroded it. Corruption and decline have reached the extreme. Ziwen is determined to rectify this situation and has instructed the anti-smuggling officers to strictly supervise in order to revitalize the system and achieve results, but to little effect. This is because the habits of the past are deeply ingrained and difficult to change. The annual losses in salt tax are staggering. After exhausting all sources, he knows that nothing short of a fundamental redesign can rectify the situation and protect the source of tax revenue. Since the spring of this year, he has begun to reorganize the special anti-smuggling teams. Everything is done in accordance with military treatment, with the aim of creating an exemplary anti-smuggling force and washing away the evils of the past. Three regiments have been formed. At that time, the war against the rebels was in full swing, and all the troops were transferred to the front. Shanghai and Songhu were quite empty, and the anti-smuggling team had to maintain a part of the security on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Subsequently, a part of the old anti-smuggling team in Huaibei rebelled, and the garrison in Haizhou had all been sent to the front line, so the first regiment was transferred to suppress the rebellion in Huaihe. The tax revenue of several million yuan per month was not affected. Moreover, the bandits in Jiangxi province took the opportunity to be rampant, and Jiujiang was in danger. Zhu, the former president, the chief of staff, and Chairman Lu discussed with Ziwen and temporarily transferred the second and third regiments to Jiujiang for defense. Since they were stationed there, they have been deterring and blocking the bandits. There have been no oversights. Now that the military situation has stabilized, the troops on the front line are returning one after another, and the salt tax on various shores urgently needs to be reorganized, and reorganization must start with anti-smuggling. All two regiments stationed in the bay must be dispersed to various salt areas to implement improved anti-smuggling duties. It is proposed to ask your Excellency to quickly dispatch capable troops to Jiujiang to take over defense, so that they can be dispatched and transferred as soon as possible to maintain the source of tax revenue. Respectfully submitted, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiang.</p>

<p>Silk factories in Shanghai have suffered huge losses due to the sharp drop in sales of foreign silk and are unable to maintain operations. They sent official letters to the landlords requesting rent reductions. The landlord of Zhenyi Silk Factory was the first to agree to the reduction. It is now known that Yongyu Silk Factory in Wuxi also received a letter from its landlord yesterday voluntarily reducing rent. It stated that, due to the sluggish sales and catastrophic drop in prices, many silk factories in Shanghai have suspended operations and have sent letters to landlords requesting rent reductions. The difficulties of the silk industry are indeed a real situation, and landlords and tenants are interdependent, so they express their understanding. The Shanghai Report had previously published a letter from the landlord of Zhenyi Silk Factory in Shanghai agreeing to reduce the factory's rent. "We dare not lag behind and will not be outdone." From this month until May next year, the rent will be reduced.</p>

<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the Qingdao City Match Industry Association of Shandong Province, stating that: "Our country's match industry has been in a precarious situation in recent years, suffering both from the aggression of foreign merchants and the impact of the current situation. If there are no appropriate maintenance measures, we will all perish together. Therefore, for the sake of promoting national goods and maintaining the industry, the country has repeatedly ordered the people to purchase domestic matches, and there are different regulations for the transportation of railways and the extraction of taxes for foreign goods. This is because we understand the difficulties of the match industry and give special relief measures. However, the foreign merchant match factories in Qingdao, Shandong, use trademarks that mostly carry the words 'Promote National Goods, Do Not Forget National Humiliation' without noting the name of the factory. They are clearly trying to pass off inferior goods as good. Our association is the united organization of domestic match factories and has the responsibility of maintaining domestic matches. We are deeply afraid that your association will be unaware and be confused by their deception. The trademarks of the Chinese factories affiliated with our association are enclosed with this letter for your reference and distribution."</p>

<h3 id="e193">The Finance, Social Affairs, and Land Bureaus Survey the Disaster in the Pusong District <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The soil in the 29th and 30th保 of the Pusong District is sandy and barren, and cotton is the main crop. Unexpectedly, the weather during the summer was unusually cold, and after the beginning of autumn, it suddenly became extremely hot again, and most of the cotton plants only flowered but did not bear fruit, or bore fruit that was not substantial. In addition, after the end of summer, a hurricane passed through the area, and continuous rain caused the already formed fruit to rot and fall off. The autumn harvest has become hopeless, with each acre yielding only a few catties or ten catties at most. The farmers in the area are in a disastrous situation and are unable to maintain their livelihoods. The 保, etc., have repeatedly requested the municipal committee member of the area to report the situation to the municipal government and asked to send personnel to investigate. The municipal government ordered the finance, social affairs, and land bureaus to send personnel to Pusong at 9:00 AM yesterday to conduct a survey. The municipal committee member Chen Yafu and staff members Wang Tongfu and Chen Zhen led the way to the disaster area for a detailed survey until 8:00 PM. By the time they returned to Pu, it was raining heavily, and all the committee members were soaked.</p>

<p>Received Telegrams from Henan Requesting Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received telegrams from the Central Organization Department's special commissioners Duan Jian and Han Xun, stating that there was desolation everywhere in the area of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. They requested urgent funding for relief. It also received telegrams from the Qixian Disaster Relief Branch of Henan, the county party department, the county government, and various agencies, describing the situation in detail. Yesterday, it also received letters from Chairman Liu of the Henan Provincial Government and Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Disaster Relief Association. It is specially announced to all gentlemen who are interested in assisting Henan that donations should be sent to the Chinese Red Cross Society at No. 2 Mabu Road, Sanbu. Receipts will be issued and the funds will be remitted to the disaster area to relieve the disaster situation and save the people from suffering. The attached Liu telegram to the provincial governments, municipal governments, provincial party departments, guidance committees, and charitable organizations states: "Henan has suffered from years of military disasters, and the repeated disasters have caused deep wounds that have never been seen before. The insurrection led by the thief Feng has turned the whole of Henan into a war zone. The dead in the rain of bullets and the forests of guns are countless, and the rebel army's conscription of livestock, vehicles, and 粮 rice and soldiers has been even more brutal, causing the children of the people in deep water and hot fire to be unable to seek life or death. When I think of this, my pain is extreme. In addition, since the summer and autumn, there have been hailstorms or locust plagues, or a lack of rain. The autumn crops have already been poor, and the sowing of wheat has been missed. Telegrams from various counties reporting disasters and requesting relief have been received. If we shelve them, we will feel uneasy. If we relieve them, our strength will be insufficient. The disastrous situation in Henan is not only that I, Liu Zhi, am in a state of sleeplessness and difficulty in eating, but also that all gentlemen have heard and sympathized with. Now that the severe winter is approaching, the desolation is everywhere, and those who are dying are looking for help. Who will present the picture of Zheng Xia? Who will open the granary to quench the thirst like Ji An? In addition to urgently requesting the Central Government to allocate huge funds for distribution for emergency relief, I also sincerely appeal to your government, your association, and all gentlemen to have the compassion of already feeling the hunger and drowning of others and to have the grand aspiration of treating all people as brothers. Please take pity on the heavy disaster in Henan and consider it a special area. Please grant huge funds to be distributed to save the disaster-stricken people. Please also raise funds in various ways to save these disaster-stricken people. Zhi will be grateful to you on behalf of the 39 million people of Henan. Liu Zhi bows with reverence. The attached Zhang telegram to the Chinese Red Cross Society states: "The disaster in Henan is extremely serious and needs urgent relief. I hereby appoint Mr. Li Huan as the representative of the association to go to Beijing and Shanghai to request relief donations. Please provide guidance in all matters to facilitate the progress. Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Disaster Relief Association, bows with reverence."</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Ford and Metong Automobile Companies invited guests from all walks of life to ride on a Ford aircraft. At that time, traffic on Hongqiao Road was bustling. More than 200 guests, half Chinese and half foreign, arrived successively. At the entrance to the airfield, company staff greeted the guests and asked them to sign in. Tickets were then distributed in order of arrival, with nine batches of fourteen tickets each. At 2:10 PM, a special flight took off first, carrying Chen Diaoyuan and people from the business community, among others. After everyone was seated, the plane ascended into the sky and headed straight for Shanghai, circling the city once and landing after about fifteen minutes. It then continued to fly up to the ninth flight. The tenth flight was for the company's staff to ride on themselves. Yesterday, the lingering rain had cleared, and the north wind was howling, with a biting cold that resembled early winter. The aircraft was sturdy in construction, well-equipped, and had several hundred horsepower. Therefore, even when braving the strong winds, it could take flight and remain as stable as a rock, and the passengers experienced no bumpy discomfort. Looking out the window, the city's scenery was clearly visible, with buildings and pavilions, as well as vegetable plots and fields outside the city, scattered like stars. By the end of the test flight, the clock struck five, and guests continued to arrive in droves. It is said that the company may hold a second invitation next week.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Overseas Chinese Affairs Association Requests Party Department to Host Assistance for Xiao Case <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Since the Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association jointly prepared with the Municipal Women's Association to assist the Xiao Xin'an case of being insulted by the Dutch, it has made extraordinary efforts in carrying out this matter. It had previously convened people from all walks of life to hold discussions and originally planned to convene a general meeting again within days. Now, as the Municipal Party Department also advocates expanding the Xiao case and has suggested taking charge of the handling, a special letter was sent to inform the progress of the preparation for assisting the Xiao case and to request the Municipal Party Department to host the handling. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, the tactics of Dutch imperialism to oppress our overseas Chinese, such as increasing the head tax and expelling Chinese teachers, are emerging one after another. Recently, there was also the incident of Zha Hua Company's Shiba De ship's chief mate and second mate insulting female teacher Xiao Xin'an. After it was disclosed in the newspapers on the 26th of last month, our association first telegraphed the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education, requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs make serious representations to the Dutch government, and we have already received a reply ordering that the situation be forwarded accordingly. This matter not only insults Ms. Xiao's personal dignity but is actually related to our national integrity and national survival. Our people should unite and rise up to organize a support association as a diplomatic backing. We should jointly issue a declaration with the Municipal Women's Association and convene representatives of various groups at our association on the 25th. We sent a letter to your association requesting the dispatch of personnel for guidance, but as there were only twenty representatives present, the meeting was changed to a discussion meeting on the same day, deciding to wait for the Hua Lian Association's petition representatives to return from Beijing before convening another meeting. In recent days, we have received letters of support from the China Seamen's Industrial Federation Organizing Committee and the Shanghai French Concession West District Business Federation, as well as the Shantou Seamen's Branch Organizing Committee. This shows that the patriotic compatriots in the country all deeply resent the Xiao case. Reading the newspaper, we know that your association has resolved to issue a declaration and submit a petition for negotiations, showing your concern for the suffering of overseas Chinese, which we admire very much. Our association is organized by returned overseas Chinese, and we should do our best to seek negotiations for the benefit of our overseas Chinese. We specially send this letter to request your association to host and lead the convening of various groups, newspapers, and schools to quickly organize a diplomatic support association against the Netherlands to resolve the Xiao case and various harsh examples of the Dutch mistreating overseas Chinese, so that our overseas Chinese can live in peace overseas in the future. This is the gift of your department, and all compatriots will be eagerly anticipating it. We earnestly request your approval and immediate convening of a general meeting to facilitate progress, which would be a great kindness."</p>

<p>The various ports and sea areas in the areas of Chongqi, Tongru, and Hai outside the Wusong estuary are riddled with branches, and large groups of sea bandits appear and disappear unpredictably. The robbery of ships and the ransoming of people are daily occurrences. Recently, the bandit army of Ma Yuren in the Yancheng and Funing areas was severely suppressed by the provincial security team and fled into the sea to the coastal counties. As a result, the sea bandits are even more rampant than before. In recent days, the situation along the coast has been extremely tense. The local public groups in each county, with the coastal people suffering from repeated looting and living in dire straits, held a joint meeting the day before yesterday to discuss prevention and suppression measures. The result of the discussion was to allocate the Zhenhai, Zhendong, and Jinghai gunboats built with local funds to the Wusong National Coast Guard Command for unified command. On the one hand, they submitted a request to Director Wu Zhennan yesterday to quickly dispatch a fleet and personally lead the fleet to depart for the coastal ports of each county to suppress the bandits and clear the atmosphere of banditry in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Seizes Opportunity to Escape, Barely Recovering Her Senses</p>
<p>Thinks Back and Forth, Bursting into Tears</p>
<p>Ji Zhu, a woman from Nantong, is eighteen years old and extremely beautiful. Her husband, Ji Chun, is addicted to opium. The couple lived in Nanjing. Ji Chun had no permanent property or savings, and he was usually unreliable, so he lacked a proper job. The family situation became increasingly difficult, and borrowing and mortgaging were exhausted. Unable to continue living, he exhausted his mind and devised a plan to lure his wife to Shanghai for fun. After arriving in Shanghai on the 17th of this month, they stayed in a small inn. On the 23rd, he colluded with his friend Zhou Daosan to secretly sell his wife into a certain brothel in the French Concession to be a prostitute, receiving a price of eighty yuan. After obtaining the money, he secretly returned to his hometown. The woman, after entering the brothel, was initially at a loss. When the madam told her the reason, she realized that she had fallen into a fiery pit. However, she could not call for help and could only lament her fate. The madam was extremely violent and would whip her if she slightly disobeyed her when receiving guests. The woman had suffered greatly for several days and could not bear it. She wanted to escape, but the guards were very strict, and there was no plan to escape. Until about 7:00 PM the night before, she took advantage of a slight lapse in the vigilance of the prostitutes and servants and escaped. She rushed to the Datong Pier in the Nanshi area and boarded the Longda steamship, intending to return to her hometown. After boarding the ship, she barely recovered her senses. Thinking back and forth, she couldn't help but feel sad and burst into tears. Yang Yinting, a water patrol officer from the Municipal Security Bureau, heard about it and rushed onto the ship to inquire about her background. The woman cried and sobbed as she told her story. Seeing her situation, Officer Yang felt pity for her and immediately led a team to wait for Chief Xu to conduct a preliminary hearing before finding a way to help her.</p>

<p>Yang Guanyuan and Shen Jiichun are admitted; Cao Tuo is on standby.</p>
<p>As the Municipal Public Works Bureau gradually expands its Pujiang ferry business, it urgently needs specialized personnel to preside over the work to facilitate progress. Therefore, it advertised for the recruitment of navigators. Twenty-three applicants were received. The bureau reviewed and selected eleven qualified candidates, and a selection test was held on the 28th of October at the No. 2 Municipal Ferry. Six people were tested. The bureau invited Ren Guangyu, Director of the Naval Demobilization Office, Chuan Cheng, Deputy Captain of the Hai Rong Warship, and Director Xi of the Port Authority to conduct the test. The next day, a Chinese language test was held at the bureau, and physical examinations were conducted at the Shanghai Public Hospital. As a result, Yang Guanyuan and Shen Jiichun were admitted, and Cao Tuo was on standby. It is reported that one of Yang and Shen has been sent by the bureau to serve on the ferry.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Power Company Requests Reconsideration of Land Price <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council members find it difficult to agree.</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that after the Municipal Council announced the new land assessment price, the Shanghai Electric Power Company requested that the land price of Fangzhaiwen and other bases should be reconsidered, as it could not be beneficial to the owners due to the increase in land price like other industries. The Finance, Donation, and Appeal Committee of the Municipal Council held a meeting on the 21st of last month to discuss this matter. The Deputy General Manager stated that the use of land does not affect the assessment price according to the land assessment method. If concessions are made to the Electric Power Company this time, other public utility companies may also request the same treatment. It has always been the case that only charitable or semi-charitable organizations are subsidized by the Municipal Council by酌量核减capturing the essence of discretionarily reducing police donations. There is no separate treatment in land price assessment. After discussion by the members, it was decided that it would be difficult to agree to the company's request for special consideration, and the original assessment price would naturally remain in effect.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Public Concession Vehicle Accident Cases in October <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>13 Deaths and 361 Injuries</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Traffic Department of the Public Concession Police, there were a total of 1,014 vehicle accident cases in the concession in October, with 13 deaths, 361 injuries, and material losses of no less than several thousand yuan. Including the previous nine months, there have been a total of 9,079 accident cases, with 121 deaths and 3,388 injuries. Since the total number of accidents throughout the entire year last year was only 9,691, with 141 deaths and 3,447 injuries, it is expected that the number of accidents, deaths, and injuries this year will exceed last year. A brief analysis of the vehicles involved in the accidents that month shows that automobiles alone accounted for 795 cases, with 242 injuries and 11 deaths. In addition, there were 516 cases involving human-powered vehicles, with 48 injuries; 163 cases involving bicycles, with 46 injuries; 48 cases involving buses, with 19 injuries and 1 death; and 129 cases involving trams, with 31 injuries and 1 death. Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road, Tibet Road, and Broadway Road are still the most accident-prone areas. In addition, the Bund also had a number of accidents. Pedestrians and vehicles passing through the above roads should be careful and slow down to avoid danger. The French Concession Police Vehicle Department statistics show that there were a total of 101 vehicle accident cases in the concession in October, with 3 deaths and 36 injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Rickshaw Industry Requests Reiteration of the Prohibition of Gang Police Hitting Vehicles <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, on the 31st of this month, we received a letter from the Rickshaw Trade Association stating that the association has repeatedly received reports from members that Hua Jie gang police have destroyed vehicles and stained the rickshaw cushions. The rickshaw pullers are unable to resist and have to endure their actions, while the rickshaw owners suffer invisible losses because of their investment. They request relief, etc. Upon arrival at the association, we found that the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau had clearly prohibited gang police from hitting vehicles and destroying property. Rickshaw pullers, driven by their livelihood, often pick up passengers at places where trams and cars stop. Their hasty glances often obstruct traffic, which is both annoying and pitiful. Gang police, due to their duties, should be calm and gentle in directing them to gradually comply while maintaining traffic, without losing sight of the poor people's situation. If they indiscriminately use their batons or hit and stain their rickshaw cushions, causing the general coolie rickshaws to flee in all directions without being spared, it would be inhumane. Moreover, destroying people's property is also prohibited by law. Based on the aforementioned circumstances, it is reasonable to request your bureau to urge the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to reiterate the previous order and order all districts to pay close attention to it in order to sympathize with the coolies and maintain commercial hardship, which would be a public convenience, etc. Upon arrival at the association, we found that gang police should only gently direct rickshaw pullers to maintain street traffic and vehicle order and should not vent their anger and indiscriminately strike vehicles and stain rickshaw cushions, resulting in the destruction of other people's property and laws, causing rickshaw owners to suffer unwarranted losses. Although your bureau has issued a ban on this matter, gang police are accustomed to doing so, and it is difficult to change their accumulated habits. It is reported that such incidents are still frequently seen. In order to protect rickshaw merchants and rickshaw pullers from extra-legal losses, it seems necessary to reiterate the ban. Accordingly, we hereby inform your bureau of the situation and request that you notify all districts to reissue the previous ban and conduct timely and effective inspections in order to alleviate commercial hardship and promote public friendship."</p>

<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that the Shanghai Electric Power Company had previously submitted a request to the Municipal Council to allow its wireless broadcasting station to broadcast the string music of the Municipal Council Orchestra at the Grand Theatre. The Municipal Council Board of Directors has now approved the company to broadcast the string music performed by the Municipal Council Orchestra at the Grand Theatre this season without paying fees or granting exclusive rights.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Continued Request to Strictly Prohibit Garbage from Being Dumped into the Huangpu River <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Shipping representative Xing Zhigang and others previously stated that the garbage in the urban area of the city has always been piled up on Longhua Mouth. Recently, the boatmen have been lazy and do not rake the garbage up and pile it up again, but instead dump it all into the Huangpu River. Therefore, they submitted a request to the municipal government to find a way to improve the situation, which has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that a part of the area is leased to the French Concession for piling up garbage, and the boatmen are even more unscrupulous, often transporting garbage to the waters near Gaochang Temple and dumping it arbitrarily during high tide, day and night. If this continues, the Huangpu River in that section will inevitably become increasingly shallow, hindering shipping and affecting commerce, which is expected. Yesterday, the representatives submitted another request to the municipal government to request that measures be taken to rectify the situation and strictly prohibit the dumping, as follows: "Respectfully, for the matter of garbage boatmen and servants disobeying the prohibition and still dumping garbage into the Huangpu River, please order the Health and Public Works Bureaus to strictly prohibit it in order to maintain water traffic. We previously contracted with the city and special district to hire boats to transport garbage to Longhua Mouth to unload at the old garbage dump. Later, because no one was in charge, the boatmen were lazy and unwilling to unload and rake it up, so they simply dumped all the garbage into the Huangpu River, causing the Huangpu River to become increasingly shallow and hindering navigation. We submitted a report to your office on October 13 to review and handle the matter. Unexpectedly, we have recently seen garbage boats still heading south during the day's high tide, passing Gaochang Temple and the Jiangnan Shipyard, and then dumping garbage into the Huangpu River one after another. The river is full of floating garbage, drifting with the tide. Many garbage boats do not have boat licenses, so they are blatantly unscrupulous. Considering that the combined population of the city and special district is about 2 million, the amount of garbage discarded every day must be considerable. Why is there no new accumulation of garbage at the designated location of Longhua Mouth? It must have sunk to the bottom of the Huangpu River without a doubt. It is also heard that the garbage boatmen, because it is inconvenient to dump during the daytime low tide, still take advantage of the night tide to dump it. This saying comes from the fishing boat households along the Xiajiazui River, who say that countless garbage enters their nets during the night high tide, and the nets are repeatedly broken. This is ironclad evidence of dumping garbage. Shanghai garbage contains bricks, tiles, gravel, coal, and sand, which are heavy and sink without a trace as soon as they are dumped. As for the light and floating objects such as reeds, white shells, firewood, and grass, they are not easy to sink and often hinder the wheels and rudders of ships. If they are blown by strong winds, they will accumulate and stagnate on the beaches along the river, endangering water conservancy. In view of this situation, we jointly submit another report to your office, respectfully requesting your approval to quickly order the Health Bureau to take measures to rectify the situation and order the Public Works Bureau to number the boats, dispatch boats for inspection, and strictly prohibit the dumping. At the same time, we also consult the French Municipal Council to jointly rectify the situation in order to maintain municipal administration and benefit shipping. We cannot bear to wait for your orders."</p>

<p>Wang Abing, Zhang Amao, and Gui Jinhua, thieves from Ningbo, robbed the British citizens Roland and Ms. Thomson of their property and shot and killed Thomson and injured Roland on Triumph Road in Shanghai West on the evening of October 3, 1928. After the case, the detectives from the Laozha Police Station investigated and arrested the three criminals, Wang, etc., and sent them to the former Provisional Court for interrogation. They were sentenced to death and reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review. However, there were still doubts about Wang Abing's part, and the case was returned to the Special District Court for retrial. The trial has now concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi of the Criminal Court took his seat and announced the verdict: Wang Abing was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly robbing and killing Thomson and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for jointly robbing and attempting to kill Roland. The life imprisonment will be carried out.</p>

<p>The man had lost his money and attempted to drown himself in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>The man narrowly survived.</p>
<p>Last night around 8:00 PM, a young man hailed a boat number 332 at the Ning Shao Pier on the Bund outside Dongmen Road, claiming to cross the river. When the boat reached the center of the river, he suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the boatman was quick and nimble and immediately managed to rescue him and send him to the Water Patrol Police Station. The police chief interrogated the man, who claimed to be Wang Xingzhen, 25 years old, from Ningbo. He currently runs the Xingzhen Foreign Goods Store in Xiangshan, Ningbo. Yesterday, he brought 300 yuan in cash to Shanghai on the Sanbei Company's Ningxing steamship to purchase goods and stayed in room 27 of the Chunjiang Hotel on Aidoo Road. At 7:00 AM this morning, he went out to Nanjing Road and Guangdong Road.</p>
<p>All of his money disappeared without a trace. I returned to the hotel and thought about it over and over again. I really felt ashamed to return home and see people, so I took this step, etc. The police chief, seeing his pitiful state, ordered Chinese detective Wu Rongsheng to send him to the Ningbo Fellow Association yesterday morning to find a way to help him.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, a woman of about thirty years of age was walking on Songshan Road in the French Concession when she was hit by a car and fell to the ground.

<p>Women are Most Easily Deceived</p>
<p>Recently, the world is deteriorating, people's hearts are getting worse, and scams are emerging one after another. It is now learned that in recent days, there has been an old man of about sixty years of age in the Chinese and Concession areas of this port, wearing cloth clothes and a black long robe, carrying a cloth bag, with a slight beard, a very simple appearance, and a language that sounds like the Nanhui Chuansha area, etc. He often lingered in the streets and alleys, first scouting and observing at the doors of each household. When he saw that there were only women in the household, he immediately pushed the door in and made a gesture of pity, claiming that he was stranded abroad and lacked funds to return to his hometown, asking for assistance with travel expenses. If there was a screen with an inscription on the guest hall of the household, he would call out the name of the inscription on the screen, saying that Mr. So-and-so also knew him, etc. The women did not know that he was looking at the inscription on the screen and impersonating the name to swindle, and because he was old and honest, they generously gave him two or three yuan in silver. When the head of the household returned home and asked about it, they mostly had no idea and had no such person to know, and they could not figure it out. The day before yesterday, a Chen family in Xiaobeimen, French Concession, was broken into by the old man and swindled out of six jiao of small silver. The next day, a Tong family, who was Chen's neighbor (five households away), was also swindled out of one yuan of silver in the same way. Later, when the two families met and talked about it, they both said it was strange. After studying it again and again, they realized that the name he called out was the inscription on the couplet in the guest hall, so he only swindled women to get his tricks. It is also heard that a Zhou family near Fangbang Bridge also had the same thing happen the day before yesterday. Alas, the treacherousness of people's hearts can be seen here.</p>

Her husband, named Defu, is 22 years old and works as a waiter at the Huamao Hotel on the Bund of Renji Road. The day before yesterday (30th) was the end of the month, and the factory paid wages. At 5:30 PM in the evening, she returned home after finishing work. Her aunt immediately asked her for wages. However, because the weather was getting colder, she needed to buy clothes and replied that she had no money this month. There was inevitably a quarrel in the language between aunt and daughter-in-law. When Defu returned home at midnight, her aunt told her son the situation. After listening, Defu scolded his wife slightly. She felt depressed and secretly went out to buy opium in order to die. It was not until 12:00 PM the next day that someone noticed and sent her to Tongren Hospital by car and then to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Because she had been poisoned for too long, her life was in danger.</p>

<p>Han Xiangji hired a lawyer to represent him in the French Court, claiming that the plaintiff had previously entrusted Zuo Tou Shen Xingji to build two houses and one wing in Qipu Road in the Public Concession. The price was set at more than 20,000 taels, excluding the 500 taels withheld as a guarantee for three months for inspection of whether the defendant had cut corners, etc. Later, the plaintiff found that the defendant had indeed cut corners, resulting in a total loss of more than 700 taels. Moreover, the defendant delivered the house two months after the deadline stipulated in the contract. According to the contract, the defendant should be fined taels, totaling a loss of 1,225 yuan. He requested that the defendant be interrogated. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend, claiming that the agreed price for the houses built by the defendant for the plaintiff on Qipu Road had already been paid in full. There was still an additional account of 1,503 taels. The defendant had repeatedly asked for payment without success. Later, a mediator was asked to order the plaintiff to return 750 taels to the defendant. Afterwards, the plaintiff only paid more than 200 yuan, and the remaining money was repeatedly delayed. Therefore, the defendant hired our lawyer to sue the plaintiff in the Special District Court. The plaintiff should wait for the Special Court's decision before filing another lawsuit. He is now ordered not to accuse the defendant in your court. Please investigate. Judge Gong Chen instructed him to wait for a ruling.</p>

<p>Is Da Peng Brand Registered?</p>
<p>Wait for Clarification and Determination Before Review</p>
<p>The British-owned Anglo-Swiss Milk Company previously reported to the Xinzha Police Station because it found that Limin Company at No. 910 Aidoo Road was selling inferior Da Peng brand milk in the city under the guise of the company's Eagle brand milk. The police station then reported to the Special District Local Court and issued a search warrant ordering detectives to confiscate the counterfeit papers. The police station then filed a complaint against the four shareholders of Limin Company, Bao Maokun, Chen Jianyi, Shen Ruilin, and Zhang Xiangquan. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi of the Special Court came to the Second Criminal Court to summon the defendants. Only Bao and Shen arrived in response to the summons. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the police station was prosecuting the defendants under Article 268 of the Criminal Law for selling counterfeit milk and Article 363 for attempted fraud. The defendant's agent lawyer claimed that the Da Peng brand milk produced by Limin Company had been registered with the Trademark Bureau, so whether it was an infringement of the trademark should be determined in accordance with the Trademark Law before proceeding. Judge Wu reviewed the confession and ordered Bao and Shen to each pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan to wait for the Trademark Bureau to determine and then review the case.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Chamber of Commerce to Develop Trade with India <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Plans to First Send Personnel for Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently received instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, along with a confidential submission from the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, India, stating that since the arrest of Gandhi in India for non-violent resistance, the boycott of British goods has intensified. Anything that is British-made, even for daily use, is being completely rejected. Products from other countries are welcomed. This is a golden opportunity for our country to develop commerce. It is hoped that Chinese merchants will send personnel to India to investigate the Indian commercial situation and to find ways to promote domestic goods. Since the opening of trade, China's international trade has declined, while the trade of various countries with China has surged forward at an incredible pace. The decrease in exports and the sharp increase in imports are clear evidence of this. The lack of unity and determination among Chinese merchants is the only reason for this situation. Since there is an opening in India, we can take the opportunity to explore. With our vast land and abundant resources, and our products being the best in the world, if we can unite and advance outwards, opening up overseas trade in British India, Calcutta, and other places is an urgent matter. It is hoped that the people of the country will catch up quickly and not let others seize the initiative. In view of this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed Consul Lu in India, requesting a detailed report on the latest commercial situation and tax regulations in Calcutta and other places.

<h3 id="e234">Review and Outlook of the China Child Welfare Association <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Wu Weide</p>
<p>In April of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Dr. Kong Yongzhi and other insightful pioneers in Shanghai, China, deeply aware of the importance of the child welfare movement and the surging international trend of child welfare, knew that in order to save the Chinese people, it was necessary to save Chinese children first, and in order to ensure the health of the Chinese nation, it was necessary to ensure the health and happiness of Chinese children first. This has been going on for two and a half years and has become a very meaningful fact in modern Chinese history.</p>
<p>After the association was first established, most of its time was devoted to organization and planning. Later, it progressed step by step, operating with a calm spirit and a rigorous pace, expanding with all its strength, and achieving some success in its work. Gradually, it attracted the attention of the Chinese people and won the enthusiastic sympathy of the general public with insight. As of now, our work is tentatively divided into the following five departments: (1) Child Protection Department (2) Child Education Department (3) Child Health Department (4) Child Research Department (5) Social Education Department. Regarding child protection, the association, aware that there are many cases of abuse of maids, servants, apprentices, and child brides in society, has issued warnings to families who abuse children, arousing the awareness of the general public, and has also obtained the cooperation of various legal and political institutions in Shanghai to pay attention to child abuse cases. Representatives of the association are allowed to attend and observe the trials of child abuse cases, and various conveniences are provided when the association sends representatives to investigate child abuse cases. In addition to actively conducting investigations, the association also provides relief as appropriate. Children who need to be adopted are either introduced to other charitable organizations for accommodation, or are accommodated by the association's affiliated Child Education Institute. Regarding the protection of children in other areas, the association has sent letters to various domestic organizations asking them to report child abuse cases to the local police authorities at any time, or to inform the association to report them on their behalf. The association has received many such letters, some from nearby areas and some from rural areas in the interior. The association has also drafted a request to the National Government to protect children's rights, establish children's laws, and establish children's courts, and plans to submit a request to the Central Party Department to issue an order to all levels of Party departments across the country to pay attention to children's rights and implement the protection of children.</p>
<p>Regarding child education, the association, during the successive disasters in Shandong, Henan, and Gansu provinces, in addition to remitting funds to provide relief to more than 4,000 disaster-stricken children, also adopted more than 300 orphaned and helpless children and sent them to the Longhua Shanghai Orphanage, Cangou Shansheng Orphanage, Tai'an Orphanage, Tengxian Tao Orphanage, Zhengzhou Orphanage, Beiping Xiangshan Ciyou Institute, Hangzhou Gan Daren Orphanage, and other places. The association has also established the Child Education Institute on Xiqijiang Road in Zhabei, Shanghai, to accommodate and educate children without parents or support. The education strives for perfection. Recently, it is also planned to establish a model Child Education Institute in Xiaotaoguan, Nanjing (the address was donated by the National Government) to take in poor children and teach them to read and work, so that they will have the ability to live independently in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding child health, the association believes that in the four districts of Zhabei, Yangshupu, Caojiadu, and Pudong in Shanghai, where poor people gather and diseases are rampant, children are particularly harmed. Therefore, in August of last year, it first established the First Child Health Clinic on Xiqijiang Road in Zhabei, and then in June of this year, it established the Third Child Health Clinic on Linqing Road in Yangshupu, providing diagnosis and treatment, visiting sick children, and disseminating health knowledge at any time, which is very popular among general families. In Zhabei, since the opening of the clinic (until the end of September of this year), a total of 8,853 children have been treated, and 1,160 families have been visited to promote health knowledge. In Yangshupu, since the opening of the clinic, which has only been three months, it has benefited 2,465 sick children, and 209 families have been visited to promote health knowledge. It can be called a day of happiness for children.</p>
<p>Regarding child research, the association has invited many child education experts to organize a child research committee to conduct psychological and physiological tests on children, and to investigate the development of children's height, intelligence, and motivation, in order to understand the normal state of development of Chinese children, and to publicize the research results to the Chinese people. It also investigates the latest child education conditions in various countries, as well as other facilities related to child welfare, in order to find suitable materials and methods for family education and introduce them to the general public at any time. The publications that have been published include the Child Welfare Monthly, Children's Stories, Children's Songs, Infant Health Chart, Pregnant Women's Health Chart, and so on. In the future, it is also planned to publish a Child Welfare Series and collect children's reading materials and toys to establish a model children's library for children to read and enlighten their knowledge and increase their knowledge. The association also intends to imitate the training methods of Professor Ssisik of Austria, who has achieved satisfactory results in the experimental art education of children, and promote children's art education in China. It has been approved by the famous artist Mr. Feng Zikai to serve as a guide.</p>

<h3 id="e236">TALKS ON TRAVELS IN FIFTEEN COUNTRIES <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Madam Hua Hua</p>
<p>On the eve of my younger sister's wedding, my cousin Li Guo Cai, Guo Qi, Guo Shou, Dr. Lu Jin Hou, Dr. Shi Yi Xuan and the author dined at Hua An Restaurant, exchanging anecdotes. Everyone asked Dr. Lu to speak about his recent book published by the Crescent Moon Bookstore, "Travels in Fifteen European and American Countries." Lu, after much urging, began to speak eloquently. Here are some of the interesting points:</p>
<p>Beauties and Idols of the New World: In the New World, idols are not heroes, but beauties. Those who have long lived in a society where heaven is superior and earth is inferior feel the overwhelming influence of women in that country even in ordinary matters. When a couple is strolling in a park, enjoying themselves, if the woman's shoelace is slightly untied, she extends her foot and whispers "Yes, dear." The husband will then nervously kneel down to fix it for her. On holidays, in parks with towering trees, one sees men pushing baby carriages with both hands, walking alone among the green trees and fragrant grass. One really doesn't know what the mistress of the house is doing in the inner chambers. In an elevator, whether acquainted or not, a man must take off his hat to a woman. On a tram, if a woman has staked claim to a seat, a man must give it to her. Compared to the Eastern custom of men and women fighting for seats, the difference is immeasurable.</p>
<p>The Old and Slow Pace of Great Britain: England is like a middle-aged woman, still with much charm. The cold elegance of St. Paul's Cathedral in London and the reflection of the ancient tower complement each other, making people linger and reluctant to leave. The British are unhurried in their work, yet successful. Americans are quick, while the British are slow and steady. To put it simply, Americans work while asleep, beauties run while working, and the British stroll leisurely while working. Let's take conversation as an example. Americans conduct important conversations mostly on opium couches, half-awake. Beauties, arm-in-arm, reveal personal, family, and even love affairs in an instant. But after spending half a day with a Briton, one still doesn't know what he means. No wonder Britain has so many diplomats.</p>
<p>The Living and Dead of France: France is a society of beauties and famous wines, so fashion is unrivaled. The Louvre Museum in Paris is a paradise for artists and poets. It is better to look at paintings here than to look at beauties. Human beauties are sometimes alive and sometimes dead, while the beauties in this museum are dead but alive, expressing intense and profound emotions. Italian paintings are strong but not glamorous, while French paintings are glamorous and beautiful, with the charm of a girl from a small family.</p>
<p>Beggars of Various Countries: Germany's patriotism, Switzerland's natural beauty, Italy's religious architecture, Austria's outward strength but inner weakness, Spain's magnificent houses, and Romania's Little Paris are too numerous to mention due to space limitations. Now, let's talk about the beggars of various countries. Begging is a reflection of material civilization. English beggars often gather in groups of five or six in front of wealthy homes, singing and playing instruments to beg. American beggars are mostly individuals who sing loudly in the early morning, disturbing people's sleep. Turkish beggars aggressively follow people, muttering incessantly. Switzerland and Belgium have relatively equal wealth, so there are no beggars at all. In Persia, harsh Russian rule has led to poverty and theft, so there are beggars everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="e237">A RECORD OF MR. MAO'S WEDDING <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Hua</p>
<p>The owner of Mei Yuan (i.e., Mei Yuan Tobacco Company and Mei Yuan Restaurant), Mao He Yuan's eldest son, Song Ting, a brilliant student at Fudan University, held his wedding ceremony with Zhou Wen Lin's daughter, Zhou Xiu Ying, at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road on October 20th. Yuan Lü Deng officiated, Zhang Shen Zhi was the master of ceremonies, and over eight hundred guests came to offer their congratulations, including Yu Qia Qing, Xu Qing Yun, Le Zhen Bao, Fang Jiao Bo, Wang Xiao Lai, and others. During the ceremony, Chen Liang Yu, Fang Jiao Bo, and Yuan Lü Deng gave speeches on behalf of the guests. The homophony of these three gentlemen's surnames formed the phrase "success is guaranteed," as the saying goes, "Without rules, there can be no success." It is customary for joyful occasions to use auspicious words. It was a good omen that such a coincidence occurred among the guests on this day. The child pulling the bride's veil was Mao's second son, and the flower girl was the famous director Zhang Shi Chuan's daughter, Min Yu, who was charming, lively, and extremely adorable. It was said that the bride's wedding dress was custom-made and extremely expensive, grand, and magnificent, unprecedented. When the bride and groom arrived at the ceremonial platform, Miss Li Ru Yan played the piano. Miss Li was a Western-style beauty with a fair complexion and eyes and hair that were light brown. She wore a deep green velvet dress, which was exceptionally charming. All the guests were captivated by her. After the piece was finished, there was thunderous applause. The Star Motion Picture Company also filmed a commemorative film. When I went to offer my congratulations, the ceremony had not yet begun, but Cheng Bu Gao and Dong Ke Yi of the Star Company were already on-site arranging the lighting and camera angles. This day was also Mao's fortieth birthday, so even more people came to offer their congratulations. In the evening, there was also amateur opera performed by the Shanghai Business Club. Many of the guest performers were close friends of Mao, so they put in a lot of effort. Chen Liang Yu, who was already sixty-four years old, not only gave a speech on behalf of the guests, but also went on stage to perform "Doing Good Deeds Brings a Son." Yuan Lü Deng's son, Sen Zhai, performed "The Golden Terrace," Chen Bao Shu's wife performed "Yu Tang Chun," Xu Mei Yun performed "Scolding the Emperor," and Li Bai Shui and Zhu Nai Geng's wife, Rong Bo Ming, performed "The Imperial Stele Pavilion." All of them were veteran performers and performed wonderfully. The audience praised them and sighed with emotion. Mao also promoted domestic goods, and for the sake of Mei Yuan cigarettes, he hired three young children to distribute special Mei Yuan brand cigarettes made by Mei Yuan Tobacco Company to the guests. The banquet dishes were also prepared by Mao's Mei Yuan Restaurant, with novel and delicious cooking styles. On this day, the gifts from all walks of life were dazzling and beautiful. It was said that dignitaries such as Foreign Minister Wang Zheng Ting, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce Zheng Hong Nian, Chiang Kai-shek's elder brother Chiang Chieh-shih, Cheng Shu Du, and Li Fu Sun all sent gifts.</p>
<h3 id="e238">ZHANG ZI LIAN AND REN JIN PING'S PATRIOTIC FERVOR FOR DOMESTIC GOODS <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>Since Mr. Zhang Zi Lian of the Nanjing Road National Products Emporium invited Mr. Ren Jin Ping to take charge of design, not only has there been major internal reform, but also assistance measures for national goods throughout the country have been stipulated. Therefore, all those who are enthusiastic about national goods are hoping for the success of the two gentlemen's plans.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at a friend's house, I learned about the background of Zhang and Ren's collaboration. It was said that the two gentlemen did not know each other three years ago. At that time, Mr. Ren was struggling all day long due to business failure, and he felt particularly distressed about economic planning. Ren's friend, Hong Xue Fan, happened to mention it to Mr. Zhang. Zhang then said excitedly, "Although I don't know Mr. Ren, I've heard of him for a long time and admire his talent. I'm willing to help him with five thousand yuan. Please ask Hong to arrange a meeting." After they met, Ren described his failures and debts. Zhang admired his sincerity even more and helped him. This was the record of the two gentlemen's friendship three years ago. In July of this year, Mr. Zhang opened the National Products Emporium on Nanjing Road. Because the manufacturers could not unanimously maintain it, the business went from prosperity to decline and then to failure. In September, Mr. Zhang invited Ren to discuss solutions. Zhang was moved and deeply regretted that he was unable to hire Ren for the job. Mr. Ren replied, "You are the confidant of my failed era. If you think I am useful, then I am willing to sacrifice everything and be at your service." This is the record of the two gentlemen's cooperation this time. Now, one is doing his best to run around, while the other is working hard at his desk day and night, without knowing fatigue. The two gentlemen's enthusiasm for national goods is truly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e239">CHRYSANTHEMUM DINNERS AND TALKS OF LONGEVITY <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>According to research, the chrysanthemum has five names: Zhi Qiang, Ri Jing, Di Nü Hua, Jie Hua, and Geng Sheng. "Pi Ya" says that "chrysanthemum" comes from "ju," which means "exhausted," meaning that the flowering season is coming to an end. Yuan Zhen's poem says, "It's not that I particularly love chrysanthemums among flowers, it's just that there are no flowers after this one blooms." Zhong Hui's "Chrysanthemum Rhapsody" says that chrysanthemums have five beauties: "Round flowers hang high, corresponding to the heavens; pure yellow without impurities, corresponding to the earth; planted early and blooming late, the virtue of a gentleman; sprouting buds in the frost, symbolizing strength and uprightness; light body in the current, extending life and longevity." Blooming proudly in the frost, the late autumn stands out alone, serene like a refined scholar, charming like a maiden. Yu Ruo Yin has the praise, "Especially suitable for the home of a recluse, not planted under a vermilion gate," comparable to the spring orchid, both belonging to the wild guests of flowers. The flowers can be used for medicine and wine making. Su Dongpo said that "flowers, leaves, roots, and fruits are all longevity medicines." "Feng Su Tong" records that there is a sweet valley in Nanyang Li Shui. The valley water is sweet and there are clusters of chrysanthemums on it. The wind blows the flowers into the water. Those who drink this water often live to a great age, up to one hundred and twenty or thirty. "Shi Yi Ji" records that there is a chrysanthemum in Bei Ming Kingdom, with stems and vines extending over several acres. Those who eat it taste sweetness and are never hungry or thirsty until death. "Ming Shan Ji" records that Zhu Ru Zi entered Yu Sun Mountain, took chrysanthemums, rode on clouds, and ascended to heaven. "Shen Xian Zhuan" records that Kang Feng Zi took chrysanthemums and became an immortal. "Qun Fang Pu" records that the Han palace people picked chrysanthemums along with the stems and brewed them with millet. On the Double Ninth Festival of the following year, they heated it and drank it. All who drank it lived to a great age. Summarizing this, although it is unofficial history, the "Materia Medica" also records that chrysanthemums have the effect of treating diseases and nourishing life. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has collected chrysanthemums for exhibition. Therefore, I have collected and described them to enrich the free talk and provide conversation starters.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty painter Jin Dong Xin was very poor, and his kitchen had no chimney, but he was not bothered by it. He had several patches of chrysanthemums in his residence, and he often picked them as food. I remember that his poem "Eating Chrysanthemums" has a line that says, "Can fill the kitchen for the evening meal, laughing at bran and chaff. Eating it brings longevity, I am also Kang Feng Zi." This also allows us to imagine the public's interesting chrysanthemum dining. I added this in addition.</p>
<h3 id="e240">TRAVELS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA (70) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the sixth day, I took the train from Myitkyina northward at 10:30 AM and arrived at Namhkam at 7:30 PM. The journey took nine hours and was about four or five hundred li. We passed two or three large rivers, all crossed by iron bridges. The mountain valleys were very high and were also crossed by iron bridges. The climate was still the same as Myitkyina and one could wear a lined jacket. There were English signs along the road indicating the elevation of each place above sea level, over two thousand four hundred feet. Namhkam was still over one thousand feet high. There were few Chinese men and women along the way, mostly Yunnanese. The Yunnanese dialect is Mandarin, so it is easy to understand. There were very few villages along the way, but many lush trees and bamboo forests, which were very beautiful. Streams and waterfalls were continuous. One often saw pagodas. An elderly Burmese woman in the car would put her hands together in prayer when she saw a pagoda, such was her devotion. Less than one-tenth of the land seen along the way was cultivated. Only ancient kapok trees grew naturally without any human cultivation. Some used bamboo tubes connected together to draw water from the mountains into the fields. This was the ancient version of running water. Jiangxi and Guangdong had this method long ago. Expanding and filling it becomes a running water pipe for people. I have a poem to record it:</p>
<p>From Myitkyina to Namhkam in half a day,</p>
<p>Endless slopes and myriad kapok trees.</p>
<p>Running water flows from bamboo tubes,</p>
<p>Yellow cloth, green cicadas, delicate and charming.</p>
<p>Everywhere there are bamboos obscuring the sky,</p>
<p>Opening mountains and building roads, the dragon dances.</p>
<p>Red houses, white iron train stations,</p>
<p>Clouds from Lingbiao seem to scatter immortals.</p>
<p>Fields have huts, and boundaries have melons,</p>
<p>Random trees are dense like hemp.</p>
<p>Waterfalls and streams gush everywhere,</p>
<p>Old vines are strange, fearing dragons and snakes.</p>
<p>The life of the villagers is extremely simple. There are no villages seen. There are also few pagodas. One also rarely sees fields. There are quite a few cattle and horses. The yellow water buffaloes all have horns that are upright and pleasing. I have a poem to record it:</p>
<p>A well sweep ties a horse to eat green grass (the method of tying a horse to a bamboo pole that is made like a well sweep).</p>
<p>Black cattle (with black on their backs, not obstructing each other) do field work,</p>
<p>Supporting fences divide the fields,</p>
<p>Three or five thatched huts form a village.</p>
<p>In various places, I often saw dry trees forming forests, which was very suspicious. I also saw sesame fields where withered trees and short stumps were not allowed. I did not understand why. After asking, I learned that this was the method of reclaiming wasteland. First, use fierce fire to burn the forest and weeds, and then you can plant the fields, because the forest is lush and you cannot use an axe. This proves that Mencius's saying that when plants and trees flourish, Shun commanded Yi to control the fire and burn the mountains and lakes, and birds and beasts fled. At this time, northern Myanmar was still in this situation. I have a poem to record the Burmese method of reclaiming wasteland:</p>
<p>Reclaiming wasteland has its own rules,</p>
<p>Fierce fires burn forests into barren mountains.</p>
<p>Sesame and sunflowers grow long,</p>
<p>Wasteland turns into gold.</p>
<p>I heard that this method is also used in the Central Plains. The reason for planting sesame first is that the sesame leaves drip a bitter dew that can cause the grass to die, so it is easy to grow. It is also thought that planting sunflowers is similar.</p>
<h3 id="e241">WARMTH IN THE HEART (306) <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tian Xiao</p>
<p>Episode 15: Tears Fall on All Sides, Grieving for Love; An Audience Captivated, Lingering on the Meaning of Fate</p>
<p>Zuo Shi Chen said, "Is there anything else to tell? Is it long? People are already urging us to wrap up. You should take off your hat before you start talking again. I'll wait for you here." Cui Yun said, "There aren't many words left. I peeled crabs and got crab roe all over my hands. I still have to wash my hands and wipe my face. That takes a lot of effort." At that time, she stood up and plucked a few chrysanthemum leaves from the dressing table, rubbed them in her palm a few times, and then used scented soap to wash her hands. It is said that chrysanthemum leaves can remove the fishy smell of crabs. He continued, "It so happened that a neighbor of Hong Lian Xiang's family was a writer of modern plays. He felt a little unfair about this matter. One day, he told the story from beginning to end backstage at a modern theater. Many friends who wrote modern plays gathered around to listen. But a backstage boss who also wrote plays heard it and said, 'This is good material. Our new plays are getting old. There are a lot of people "pulling candles" in the official boxes these days. We need to change things up. We'll quickly write it in a week, the faster the better. Our kind of current affairs play is sure to sell. We can rely on two kinds of viewers now. One kind is the wives, concubines, and young ladies in the official residences. The other kind is the girls in the brothels. Now this play connects the official residences and the brothels. If we add some descriptions and interludes, it will be a good play. If we put up a big advertisement and get a few brokers to invite them, we can earn them a few thousand dollars on this play.' Everyone was quite happy to hear this. Sure enough, it took less than ten days to rehearse and it was immediately put on. The name of the play was "Lotus Falls." On that day, they opened at eight o'clock. By seven o'clock, the guests were already seated. There were still many people who hadn't booked in advance who insisted on coming in. The theater manager had no choice but to hang up a "full house" sign and close the iron gate in front of the door, repeatedly apologizing to the people, explaining, 'Please come early tomorrow.' I managed to book a few seats on the third day. That day, the famous Dan actor Shen Ying Hong played Hong Lian Xiang. His appearance was perfect. Everyone could see that he was a man. It was said that he had been hired by a young widow from a prominent Shanghai family. Every day, she sent him to the theater in a chauffeured car and picked him up from the theater in a chauffeured car, fearing that someone would try to court him and make him their concubine. The person who played Madam Yin was a famous shrew, releasing a kind of shrewish method that really scared people to death. In the scene where Hong Lian Xiang was beaten that night, kneeling down to Madam Yin and saying goodbye, Shen Ying Hong really knew how to act, kneeling on the ground, holding Madam Yin's knees, tears really falling down. Seeing this scene, all the women in the front hall and boxes were shedding tears, even sobbing loudly."</p>

<h3 id="e242">FINANCIAL AND GOLD MARKETS SLIGHTLY LANGUID <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Autumn Horse Race: Gold Exchange Closed for Three Days After the Session</p>
<p>Market Conditions Initially Rose, Then Fell: Gold Bidding Situation on November 1st</p>
<p>Prices rose slightly, but changed unpredictably, with fluctuations of one or two taels. Transactions among peers were still active, but without direction, with frequent purchases and sales. Fuxing, Yongshunli, and others mainly bought in, while Yongchengchang, Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuda, and others sought supply with differences. Foreign exchange seemed loose and unregulated. Banks came in and out again. Overseas silver markets only rose slightly in large bars, without any impact, because there was talk in the United States of selling silver bars, which made people uneasy. The gold market opened higher, and large buyers competed, once reaching eighty-seven taels. Afterwards, Xianfang was very strong, but market conditions turned from strong to weak, falling three or four taels. Finally, it was only between eighty-three taels. Next week is the Western merchant autumn horse race, so both long and short positions were cautious and conservative, or should have been squared up, so it was still hovering. The amount of notes exchanged was about 51,000 to 52,000, which was not much. Afterwards, the market closed as usual on Saturday.</p>
<p>After the market closed, small deals were made again. The opening price for December was 585 taels and 6 qian, an increase of 1 tael and 4 qian (gross profit of more than 4 taels to 6 taels). Although London silver bars increased by 1/16 and New York silver prices remained the same, people were still stable. Then, Zhifeng, Yong, Yongchengchang, Yuanxing, Yongda, Decheng, and others all came to buy, so it gradually rose by more than 1 tael. Foreign exchange stabilized. Sumitomo ate up the spot Dalian for 1 tael, 2 qian, 7 fen, 1/2/5, and the British gold banks mutually traded 173,125 in December. When the prior order was announced, it reached 87 taels. The hanging price remained unchanged. Internally, it was also flat, but Dadacheng, Yuda, and others sold some. The wheat bank also sold 173,125 British gold in December. The spot Dalian could only be sold for 1 tael, 2 qian, and 7 fen. Then Sumitomo and others bought it, so the gold price fell back by 1 tael. Then Yongchengchang, Hengxing, Zhifeng, and Yong followed and sold, so it continued to fall by 1 tael. At 10:25, it was 84 taels and 9 qian, and then it rose by 2 qian. Then Taogu and others chased in. Sumitomo ate up the spot Dalian for 1 tael, 2 qian, 7 fen, 0.625. Around 11 o'clock, it was 5 taels and 89 qian. After entering, HSBC sold British gold 173,125 this month. Zhengjin bought British gold 173.75 in December. Various numbers were thrown out, so the market felt even more languid. Fuchang, Xieyu, Yongchengchang, Yongfeng, and Taotou were trying to get rid of it. After a while, it fell to 84 taels. After a while, it was slightly higher or lower by a few qian. Yuanmao Yong and retail investors were selling hard. At 11:30, it suddenly fell to 83 taels. Afterwards, there were mutual rotations of 6 to 7 qian, seeing 3 taels, 7 or 8 qian. At noon, Zhifeng Yong and others sold quite a bit, so the closing price was 83 taels and 1 qian, a decrease of 1 tael and 1 qian compared to the day before. Small deals were made again for about 2 taels, 1 or 2 qian. The maximum price during the half day was 87 taels, and the minimum price was 83 taels, a difference of 4 taels. The announced price was still 619 taels and 8 qian, a decrease of 33 taels to 37 taels. Accounts were registered for 92 taels to 83 taels. Water replenishment was 92 taels. Goods will open for 5 taels and 6 qian, and the noon closing price was 2 taels and a half.</p>
<p>The various numbers were mostly volatile. Among the transactions among peers, Yuanxing Yong, Fuxing Yong, Shunli, and Tianyu Yong all bought in. Fuchang, Yuancheng, Xieyu, Senchang Yong, and Tongtaichang all sold out. Wanxing, Dadacheng, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Yuda, Hengxing, and Yongchengchang all had abnormal ups and downs, but the quantity exceeded the constant. Goods were also grabbed, with frequent purchases and sales. The Dalian gang bought more than 600 bars and sold more than 400 bars. The Guangdong gang still had few buys and sells, but there were occasional entries and exits. This month's 3rd, 4th, and 5th (i.e., Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) the exchange will open half an hour earlier at 8:30 AM and close at 11:30 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e243">FOREIGN EXCHANGE INNER MARKET SLIGHTLY LOOSE <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Gold Industry Initially Pulled, Then Thrown</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market rose slightly, and the British-American and British-Japanese exchange rates fell slightly. However, Yokohama and Kobe markets still had no glory or disgrace to record. HSBC's listed foreign exchange had no changes. However, the bank's internal market, such as British and American exchange rates, was initially flat and then loose. The Japanese exchange rate turned firm and then languid. This was because of the tendency for gold bidding to rise and then fall. There was a four tael difference in half a day. Generally, retail investors were mostly squaring up both long and short positions. Market prices were inevitably in a state of rotation. By noon, the result of each exchange compared to the day before showed that British gold increased by 0.0625, American gold increased by 0.125, and Japanese gold decreased by only 0.125. Among Chinese merchant gold companies, there was initial pulling and then throwing, but the number was not large. If the Guangdong gang Shengda and others invested tens of thousands of pounds, Hua Yi and the wheat bank would sell them. Afterwards, various numbers tended to sell 50,000 to 60,000 pounds. Zhengjin had a strong appetite. Also, Huabi and Mitsui and others had buys. Huabi, HSBC, Shanghai, and others sold to Zhengjin and Datong for tens of thousands of pounds. American dollars were traded mutually by the China-America Bank for 100,000 yuan. The Dalian gang had previously sold spot Dalian for tens of thousands of yuan, which was purchased by Sumitomo and Taiwan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend, there was no market.</p>
<h3 id="e244">LARGE SILVER BARS SHOW A SLIGHT UPWARD TREND <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraphs, large silver bars have shown a slight upward trend, with both near-term and long-term increasing by 0.0625, both to 16 5.5625 (equivalent to British gold at 1 shilling 7 5.5625). Footing India bought in, but trading was not high. After the closing, Citibank tended to sell, and market conditions were uncertain. Also, according to New York telegraphs, American silver prices have not contracted, with spot at $3.5875. British versus American fell by 0.03125 to $4.858125. American versus British remained unchanged at $4.8384375. Japanese versus American remained at 49.6875 yuan. British versus Japanese fell by 0.03125 to 2 shillings 0.053125.

Details are omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e245">WEEKEND ZERO INTEREST MARKET SILENT <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>General Market Situation: The procedure for settlement at the end of the previous day was unusually complex and time-consuming. Yesterday was Saturday and the banks were closed in the afternoon. The zero-interest market was even more depressed and the silver root was even more lax. There was really no need to record the fixed capital. Now, I will just record a general picture of the situation as an example.</p>
<p>Zero Interest Price (Foreign Interest): The early market was at the spectrum of 7 qian, 2 fen, 6 li and a half, 2 hu and a half (Silver Interest). The early market was 6 fen, and the noon market was even more unregulated, only 2 fen, and the distance from the white borrowing market was not far. The drawing head was always white drawing. The bank's listed price had not been listed for a long time.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Situation: The early market of Jiangnan small foreign was 6 qian, 4 fen and 1 li. The market conditions were still good by 1 li compared to the previous day, and a transaction of 4,000 jiao was made. There was no competition in the noon market, and the market price remained the same. A transaction of 1,500 jiao was made. The early market of Guangdong small foreign was 6 qian, 3 fen, 5 li and 7 hao and a half. The noon market returned to good half a li, calculated as 6 qian, 3 fen, 6 li and 2 hao and a half. Transactions were made in the early market of 85,000 jiao, and the noon market of 40,000 jiao. Copper coins were reduced by 1,500 wen to 388,500 wen, and more than 35,000 strings were traded.</p>
<p>Silver Foreign Entry and Exit (Silver Funds): Yesterday, the bank received settlement news, with Chinese merchants receiving settlement funds of more than 1.8 million, foreign merchants receiving settlement funds of 1.45 million, and various goods, taxes, and other funds receiving settlement of more than 7 million, more than the 6 or 7 million received the day before. 800,000 were taken out of the warehouse and 300,000 entered the warehouse. Japanese merchant banks received settlement of various funds of more than 4.2 million. 300,000 were taken out of the warehouse. Qianzhuang silver public list received settlement of more than 41 million, and head fund was received for settlement of 3.1 million. Various road exchange funds were received for settlement of more than 900,000, and 700,000 to 800,000 was received in cash. (Foreign Funds): Exchange settlement funds made 1.395 million in the early market and 1.328 million in the noon market. Banknotes made 10,000 in the noon market. Outside the market, banknotes made 134,000 in the early market and 93,000 in the noon market. The banks traded 550,000 mutually in the early market and 500,000 mutually in the noon market. Various banks received more than 1.3 million in foreign accounts and more than 1 million in banknotes entered and exited. Qianzhuang foreign public list received more than 5.3 million and foreign head fund received more than 1.4 million. Borrowing and lending foreign funds entered and exited 700,000. Small peers received and exchanged banknotes and sold exchange heads, trading more than 600,000. The source from the passenger route was more than 400,000 and the expenditure was 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e246">SUPPLEMENTARY RECORD OF THE SETTLEMENT SITUATION AT THE END OF OCTOBER <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The previous day was the busiest day for the financial community at the end of October. The time for sorting out various settlements was relatively late. The bank's account room was not fully settled until 10 o'clock. The handling of Qianzhuang public lists was also delayed until after 12 o'clock. The result of the settlement was that there were more than 73 million in silver public lists and more than 12 million in foreign public lists. The bank's silver head funds were more than 80,000 and the foreign head funds were more than 5 million. Other various funds entered and exited a total of more than 20 million. Long-term funds were settled for more than 8 million. Transfers were more than 70 million. New transactions were more than 10 million. Foreign accounts summarized various funds for 7 to 8 million. Fortunately, the silver root was relatively loose, so it could be handled calmly and unhurriedly. If, like in previous years, the silver root was tight, and the head cushion was insufficient, and you had to dig a well when you were thirsty, there would be a major upheaval.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Securities and Bond Market Hovering with Slight Decline <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market was quieter than the previous day. All parties temporarily held a wait-and-see attitude, and the supply was very flat. The market was particularly stable. However, the spot prices of Series 19 and Disbandment bonds surged due to a long absence of trading. The spot prices of continued small bonds and the November futures of Series 19 also rose slightly. Other bonds slightly decreased by a few cents. The total spot trading volume for the day was only 5,400 yuan. The trading volume of futures in the morning session was over 3.3 million yuan, and in the afternoon session was over 2.8 million yuan, totaling 6.22 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is dull and lifeless, with a very weak situation. However, the overseas three-brand yarn market is stable. The local market is under pressure from the excessive inventory of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn, making it difficult to increase prices. Moreover, the selling pressure is increasing, and the demand for spot yarn is not very smooth. Therefore, people are very tired. Judging from the overall situation, it is of course difficult to rise. However, due to the underlying relationship, there are no large-scale selling households. Currently, it is still in a hovering situation.</p>
<p>People's Standard Clearance is Flat. The opening price of the People's Standard market in the morning session was weak due to the flat American cotton, and the market sentiment was not strong, so the trading was very light. There were no significant ups and downs in any month, with each rising by three cents. In the afternoon session, the market sentiment was slightly weaker, with each falling by two cents. The first trading day of April was not opened due to the commission increase issue. The sales were all empty boards. The sell orders were Maoji 400 bales, Senkang 400 bales, Gongtai 550 bales, and the rest were 2-300 bales. The buy orders were Hezhen 400 bales, Yiyu 300 bales, Zhenda 300 bales, and the rest were 2-300 bales. The total trading volume was 5,800 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing	Rise/Fall	Inventory	Closing Price	Rise/Fall	Inventory</p>
<p>November 1478	…	34800	January 1490	…	39350</p>
<p>December 1482	…	39400	February 1498	Up 3	30650</p>
<p>March 1505	…	19500</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are Still Good The sales of spot yarn are still good. According to statistics, all firms bought a total of 1,250 bales throughout the day. The market was flat. Among the customer firms, Sichuan imported 825 bales, Guangdong imported 155 bales, the inland imported 120 bales, Qingdao imported 25 bales, Yunnan imported 36 bales, and miscellaneous firms imported 75 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Cotton Market Stable <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, but after the continuous rise in American cotton, the market sentiment has also stagnated. However, the Japanese firm Toyo Cotton is still optimistic about the high price of Hankou cotton. The source is still not smooth, and the yarn market has a large output. Therefore, some people are shorting at high prices. The actual trading of each factory is still sluggish, so most people continue to be pessimistic. In short, if American cotton can stabilize and form an upward trend, local cotton will naturally rise and fall accordingly.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Has No Major Ups and Downs. The opening price of Hankou Standard in the morning session was slightly restrained due to the falling trend of American cotton, resulting in a part of cotton resisting and firmly rising by 1 cent. The 2-3 rounds rose again. As a result, each month rose by 0.5 to 1.5 cents. The market was still firm when the market opened in the afternoon. Later, Xincheng sold out and fell by 1 cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,100 piculs. The sell orders were Maoji 1,200 piculs, Dafu 1,900 piculs, Xincheng 3,000 piculs, Gongtai 1,800 piculs, and the rest were 6-800 piculs. The buy orders were Hengyi 2,200 piculs, Shenyu 2,800 piculs, Tianlong 1,400 piculs, Hengchang 1,700 piculs, and the rest were 8-900 piculs. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Deginning is Still Good The sales of spot cotton are still flat, but the market price of foreign cotton has also risen. The source counts Yao cotton 2,600 bales, general cotton 500 bales, average Gal 3,000. Yong'an Factory imported 200 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>American Cotton Southern Hedging Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to southern hedging, then strengthened due to short covering, and finally weakened again due to the sluggishness of Wall Street. Spot prices fell by 5 pounds, and British cotton futures fell by 2-3 points. Spot prices and futures fell by 6-14 and 8 points respectively. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, and brokers bought. Prices of all Plain, Gore, Ommra and Bai Luoxi fell 3 rupees. The original telegram record is on the left (31st telegram).</p>

<h3 id="e251">American Cotton Seeks to Reduce Planting <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>The Cooperative Will Stockpile 2 to 3 Million Bales</p>
<p>A New York telegram on the 31st reported on the cotton market situation for the week, saying that at the beginning of the week, the price of raw cotton rose, and southern hedging increased compared to before. There were also some reactionary sell-offs and liquidation of long positions, but the number of sell-offs was absorbed by short covering and purchases by peers. After that, the price slightly fell, and the buying trend became more intense, while hedgers reduced due to the price drop. It is found that the main reason for the rise in raw cotton prices is probably the prediction of the number of cotton fields in the coming year affected by the current cotton price, and the report of the improvement of the domestic and Lancashire cotton markets. Some believe that due to heavy rain and low climate in recent years, the estimated cotton production in the next season may not have a large increase in output. The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Agriculture estimates that the cooperative will stockpile 2 to 3 million bales of cotton this season. It is heard that the Banking Associations of important cotton producing states are now discussing ways to reduce the acreage of cotton planting next spring. Also, the sentiment of speculators is reactionary, and the profit margins of peers are thin when prices rise. Most opinions believe that the next government may exceed the previous estimated stockpiling action, and the underlying prices are more firm. The demand for prompt shipment is only flat, and the sentiment of domestic cotton cloth trade is better than before, and the trading volume is also larger than before. The weekend statistics are as follows (single thousand bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than 20 boats came from the inland to Zhabei. The city consumption was extremely pleasant at first because of the rain during the Temple Festival. Then, because the weather turned sunny again, it felt slightly dull. There were few inquiries for high-quality new japonica rice, so the price only shouted up to nearly 14.70-80 cents at the top. Ordinary Zhongguan rice was generally adulterated by two cents. The external market tended to be weak at noon. Due to the scarce arrival of thin rice, it was seen to be up a few cents, with high-quality goods opening at 13.70-80 cents. The general increase in Yangdu Xiang rice was two cents, which was due to the very active sales to customers and the sellers holding on to their sales. Gaodu Jian reached 12.20 yuan. The retail sales of Shanghai Xiang rice were extremely prosperous here, and the transaction was extremely good. High-quality goods were also popular with customers, and all grades above average continued to rise by two to three cents. The top-grade customer Jian must reach 11.40 yuan. The change in yuan arrival and sales was still mediocre, with a high opening of 15.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 sources arrived on Lunan Luli Road, and sales were flat. The top-quality goods of Changbang new japonica rice still hovered at 14 yuan. Zuo Sutong white japonica rice, because the appetite of Chonghai and Tongsha and other villages was slightly tight, opened high at 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Lingnan Bangjiaoli kiln species, Baige, and other rice showed a steady trend. The top kiln species price was 13.20 yuan, which was slightly better than the previous day by a few cents. There was no rise or fall in Yangdu Jian. Not many Yin Hua Bai Yuan arrived in Nanlu, most of which were scattered small bills. The situation was firm, and the market was 12.2-3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Flour Market Shows a Sharp Decline Again <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market situation for each month showed a sharp decline again. At the beginning of this month, the initial opening was still above 7 cents. Then, small and medium-sized factories still filed out in various near and far periods. Although each factory was extremely short of spot goods due to raw material relations, the actual sales still lacked large-scale sales markets. However, most people felt that after a bumper year, flour would be difficult to be uniquely expensive. Both inside and outside the industry almost unanimously tilted to sell out, so the opening prices of each board fell again. According to the general people's speculation, the forward period must return to the 2-qian mark before it can stabilize. As a result, this month fell 3 cents compared to the end of last month, December fell 2 cents and 2.5 li, January fell 2.5 cents, February fell 2 cents and 7.5 li, March fell 2 cents and 2.5 li, and April had also started up, with the highest opening in the morning at 2 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen, and the closing also fell by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Wheat Market Unanimously Crashed <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market situation in each month uniformly crashed again, especially in the forward period. The quotation of foreign wheat was again 2-3 cents lower. Most people in the market believe that the purchase of foreign wheat by various factories in this and other ports has long become a reality. Although the shouting price of local wheat cannot meet the factory's intention, this is probably a local problem and has nothing to do with the overall situation. In addition, the needs of Nanfen in the northern harvest are more lonely, so in terms of the environment, it is really impossible to overestimate. Therefore, the selling atmosphere in each board was very strong, and sharp falls were seen. As a result, this month fell by 5 cents compared to the closing price at the end of last month, December fell by 7 cents, January fell by 6.2 cents, February and March fell by 8 cents, and April also followed the report of the initial price of 4 taels 4 qian and 1 fen, and then it also fell by 3 cents. Because the standard of existing wheat is confused, the city did not open.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Ke Xiang Arrives and Sales are Strong <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still merchants from Min, Yue, and the North inquiring about Ke Xiang. This street also had a small number of inquiries about Yuan Ban Cao Ban and other types. The market was active, but the arrival of goods was more than the previous day. In addition to Jiangxi Ban, there were also Nanjing Xiang rice and Hunan Ji Yuan, etc. Hunan's rice harvest this year was very good, and there was a proposal to export in large quantities, but it was blocked by donations and taxes. It has been a long time since it has continued to arrive, and the cost is not cheap, so the Shanghai price has fallen sharply, and it will be difficult to get through in the future. However, the quality of Ji Yuan rice there is better, and both Shanghai and local customers welcome it. The selling price is better than other Ke Yuan, and the selling price in the place of origin is still cheap, so the Public Record and other households have gradually trafficked it. The new arrival of more than 200 bags the day before yesterday was priced at 15 yuan and 37 cents. Due to the high arrival of Ke Xiang, it was difficult to rise. It is estimated that 600 bags of Jiangxi Ji early rice opened at 10 yuan, 9 cents to 10 yuan, 3 cents. Also, 150 bags of Ji late rice were priced at 12 yuan. 3 cars of Nanjing Ji Cao rice were priced as in the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Piece Goods Market Takes a Sharp Turn Downward <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The market for cotton fabrics from this factory has been fluctuating in recent days. The fine twill, which has been firm for a long time, suddenly declined yesterday, which is actually due to the gradual increase in spot goods and the excessively high prices. Yanghe sells for 7 taels and 5 fen, and Blue Double Fish sells for 6 taels, 8 qian, and 7.5 fen. After observation, the trend of decline may be just beginning. The decline of fine cloth is even more severe, with a slight decrease of 2.5 fen yesterday, so the sales are even more deserted. 50 pieces of Hubei Tianzi coarse cloth have been transported here, and there will be continuous arrivals later. The price is 8 taels and 5 qian, 13 pounds. Ningbo merchants have slightly managed to sell 1 Bull Head coarse cloth, and the price is 5 taels, 7 qian and 5 fen, 11 pounds. The Tianjin merchants imported 100 pieces of 3 Rabbit coarse twill yesterday, and the price is 5 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen.</p>
<p>The sales of east-west piece goods have been affected by the end-of-year settlement of the National Calendar, and this street is stagnant. The customer merchants are also watching and not moving forward, so the market is declining. Yesterday, the Shuilang velvet of Donghuo fell again. It was still 2 qian and 2.5 fen in the morning, but it had fallen to 2 qian and 2 fen in the afternoon. The Lovely Beauty Yuxian, Tulips, and Book inscriptions have all been transported here, and the price is 2 qian and 1 fen and 7.5 li, but business can be loosened as much as possible. The printed velvet is even more unbearable to look back on, and the decline is so severe that it is crazy. The inferior colors have already entered the customs at 2 qian, but the way to go is still rare. Western goods are even more lifeless.</p>

<p>Japanese Sugar Turns Higher with Factory Disc Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegraphed that the current sugar price in Cuba was 1.375, compared with the previous telegram, it rose by 0.0625. The December price of New York sugar futures was 1.43, and the March price of the next year was 1.53, each rising by 4 cents. The May price was 1.58, rising by 3 cents, and the September price was 1.71, also rising by 4 cents. The current Java sugar price was 8.375, and the November and December prices of sugar futures were both 8.125, with no rise or fall compared to before. The market price of Hetang No. 24 rough sand white at the Public Association was still 7 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen. The market atmosphere was very flat. The medium sand white saw a slight increase, with the price of No. 20 goods reaching 6 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, and the price of No. 18 goods reaching 6 taels and 9 qian. However, because there will be two Dutch ships arriving in the next few days, the market situation is generally flat and not unusual. Japanese sugar's factory disk telegrammed back saying that the original price would not be sold, so people's hearts turned better and it also rose slightly. YRO Mark 7 taels 3 qian and 5 fen, TM Mark 7 taels 4 qian, YT Mark 7 taels 6 qian and 6.75 fen, YP Mark 7 taels 9 qian. The market situation is quite brisk, but it is worried that the actual sales are not smooth. Xiangmao Foreign Firm continued to open 300 tons of Hetang rough sand white goods arriving at the end of November, priced at 6 Dutch guilders. A new tax number has been opened for Xiamen rock candy green, with a price of 7 taels and 2 qian, and the market is also mediocre.</p>

<p>Recently, because the sales of Wufu White Ice have been active, although the number of batches that have arrived before and after is not small, as of yesterday, it has been completely converted to cash, and the price is 6 taels and 6 qian, and those who need it are still ordering successively. Therefore, the manager of the company telegraphed to Xiamen yesterday to urge the factory to load the goods. According to the reply, they are urging the production and will ship it out immediately, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign company silk market was quiet because the Shanghai silk factories were all closed yesterday. The price of Yokohama Japanese silk tended to weaken. The European companies were reluctant to buy Sichuan dried silk because the price was high. The market was dull. Silk sales were completely stopped yesterday.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the week in the New York market, each silk weaving factory started to buy up the raw silk for January and February because the price of Japanese silk had fallen to the lowest limit. The price per pound gradually rose by one to two cents. In the second half of the week, the economic situation continued to be unstable. The speculators took the opportunity to sell the futures silk in their hands, and the market price fell sharply. On Thursday, the price of Japanese silk fell sharply by 28 American cents and the current silk fell by 35 cents. The market sentiment suddenly became dull.</p>

<h3 id="e284">Paris Music Season <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Cai</p>
<p>— Held from October every year —</p>
<p>The Paris music season, as usual, starts in October every year. The 1929 season began with a symphony concert by the Dutch Kongi Tonerbo (conducted by Mengelboke). Subsequently, from the first Saturday of October, various symphony orchestras began regular performances, deeply increasing the fervor of musical mystery.</p>
<p>Regular performances usually end in March or extend to early April, but various concerts are held every night after that. Moreover, first-class orchestras from Berlin and Vienna, not to mention distant New York and Boston, often come to add to the vibrant spring music scene (the Boston Symphony only did not cross the Atlantic for the 1929-30 music season). These performances continue until June, so the only months when music cannot be heard in Paris are July to September. There are about ten symphony orchestras in Paris, far more than in Berlin and Vienna, and seemingly also more than in New York, so it can truly be considered the best in the world. Most of these orchestras hold regular performances on Saturday and Sunday afternoons (evening symphony concerts are rare), so these two days often have overlapping concerts, and Parisians often struggle to choose. The following is a brief introduction to the famous symphony orchestras that will show their talents during the music season.</p>
<p>First-Class Symphony Orchestras Among the symphony orchestras currently existing in Paris, the first-class ones are the Concerts du Conservatoire, Concerts Colonne, Concerts Lamoureux, and Concerts Pasdeloup. Among them, the Concerts du Conservatoire is the symphony orchestra of the Conservatory, with Professor Philippe Gaubert, a professor of the orchestra department of the same conservatory, as the conductor. The musicians also include professors of the Conservatory's music departments, so in terms of technique, it can be said to be the best of the best. The conductor Gaubert also serves as the conductor of the theater and often directs famous dramas. He seems to specialize in German music, so the Conservatory's performance repertoire also features many works by Beethoven and Wagner. These are indeed very powerful performances, especially because the concert hall of the Conservatory is small, so the sound fills the entire room, and the initial impression is truly like that of a German symphony. Regular performances are held every Sunday afternoon during the music season.</p>
<p>Concerts Colonne is led by the old conductor Gabriel Pierné. Because the conductor is elderly, the musicians are also mostly old, and the performances only have maturity and solidity but lack vitality. The repertoire is also relatively old, although there are also premieres of new works by current French composers and works by Stravinsky and Prokofiev, but Colonne's talent is arguably not in this area. Although the old conductor Pierné has a comprehensive and rich knowledge and experience of music, and also has a lot of sympathy for new music, sympathy and empathy are definitely not the same. Their regular performances are on Saturday and Sunday afternoons every week, and the venue is the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.</p>
<p>Concerts Lamoureux is conducted by Albert Wolff. Although the musicians are similar to those of Colonne, the repertoire is much newer than Colonne's. Regular performances are held on Saturdays and Sundays every week at the Salle Gaveau, and the premieres of works by current composers from home and abroad are always performed. Sometimes Prokofiev is invited to conduct his own works, and Ravel is invited to conduct the premieres of his new works. In addition, the premiere repertoire performed from autumn 1929 to spring 1930 included the three works of Respighi (Italian) "Roman Festivals," "The Pines of Rome," and "The Fountains of Rome," as well as the Spanish composer Falla's "Nights in the Gardens of Spain," etc. Wolff was originally one of the literary conductors, so the detailed interpretation of these performances is naturally extremely meticulous, and there are few flaws in the overall integration, so he is a skilled and famous conductor.</p>
<p>Concerts Pasdeloup has two conductors, one is Rhené-Baton and the other is Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht. Baton spends half of the music season on foreign tours, so when he is not there, Inghelbrecht conducts. Inghelbrecht is still very young, so there is a sense of being unable to cope as a conductor. The partial interpretation can be said to be meticulous, but the overall command is still lacking.</p>
<p>During the 1929-30 music season, Pasdeloup devoted all its efforts to the complete performance of large-scale works, mainly Bach's Mass in B Minor, Milhaud's "Les Choéphores," and, in cooperation with the Russian Opera Association, "Prince Igor" and "Boris Godunov." Regular performances are also on Saturdays and Sundays, and the venue is the Théâtre du Châtelet.</p>
<p>Orchestras Secondary to the Four Orchestras The first-class symphony orchestras are naturally only the above four, but in addition, there are orchestras that have not yet been listed as second-class but should be added to the first-class, namely the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris and the Orchestre Straram. Because both were organized later, their qualifications are still shallow, so in terms of control, they are also slightly inferior to the former.</p>
<p>Two Second-Class Orchestras The two second-class orchestras are Concerts Poulet and Concerts Chevillard. In addition, there are Concerts Symphonique and Concerts Diba. The former is sponsored by the daily newspaper "Journal," with the auditorium of the same company as the venue. Regular concerts are held every other Sunday afternoon. As for the repertoire, it is mostly popular and lengthy famous pieces, and very few are performed in their entirety, so it can only be said to be an enlightenment movement. The conductor is Tomasi. The latter holds concerts every Sunday, and the repertoire includes</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>In addition to string music, there are also many variations such as solo singing, solo performances, and ensembles, which are more enlightening than the former.</p>
<p>Of course, the repertoire of the above-mentioned symphony orchestras is mostly French productions. Among foreign composers, Stravinsky is the most popular, and Parisians also greatly love the works of Beethoven and Wagner.</p>
<p>Looking at the above situation, we can understand that Paris has now entered the music season that young people are looking forward to, and there are two days a week to enjoy intoxicating music. Paris, which Parisians call the city of happiness, is qualified enough with just this point, right?</p>
<h3 id="e285">Jean Viollier <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Deming</p>
<p>The Painter of Dreams</p>
<p>Recently, an amazing painter has appeared in the French art scene. That is Jean Viollier, the painter of dreams. Viollier is only twenty-four years old this year, but his novel art has already made him stand at the forefront of French painters. Now let me introduce the art of this rising great painter—</p>
<p>Viollier has created a world in his paintings. What kind of world is this? Some people say it is a world of madmen, but Viollier is not a madman. His mind is very clear. Some people say he is pretending to be crazy, which is also wrong. He never fakes it. Simply put, he is painting a kind of painting that no one has ever painted before—the painting of dreams. The painting of dreams is different from "dreamlike" painting. If we want to understand Viollier's art, we must recognize this distinction.</p>
<p>Viollier objectively records the world that people see at night. He does not deliberately create a nightmare or a beautiful dream. Nor is he recording his own dreams or someone else's dreams. He captures the dream scene in an instant and gives it the form of painting, fixing it on the canvas.</p>
<p>When we look at his paintings, we get the feeling we have when we are drowsy, the feeling that we clearly see a phantasm. We yearn to capture that phantasm, but that phantasm changes rapidly and is not under our control. Viollier, however, uses swift and decisive means to capture those phantasms and present them on the screen.</p>
<p>Viollier's paintings must be distinguished from allegorical paintings. In allegorical paintings, the painter uses symbols to suggest ideas, such as painting a blind woman holding a scale to suggest the concept of "fairness." Apart from using obscure symbols, the meanings of these allegorical paintings are easy to understand. On the contrary, Viollier's paintings cannot be explained by reason and logic. The many things painted on one of his paintings are all ordinary, which is precisely the phenomenon of dreams. For example, the illustration "The Poet's Inspiration" attached here depicts a collection of things such as human heads, electric poles, electric wires, human hands, and pieces of paper, which have no logic to speak of, but are a real and reasonable dream.</p>
<p>Viollier's paintings must also be clearly distinguished from those dreamlike paintings, which has already been said above. The authors of those dreamlike paintings originally could not express their fantasies in a clear form due to a lack of skill, so they painted everything extraordinarily hazy and dazzling, stealing the beautiful name of poetic painting or mystical painting. On the contrary, Viollier expresses his fantasies extremely clearly. The scenes he paints are all those that we can really see in dreams. Looking at the illustration "The Poet's Inspiration," it is not some mystical painting, but a real record of a dream. This dream is one that you and I can dream.</p>
<p>Because Viollier's paintings are records of dreams, they can not only be appreciated by art lovers, but also provide material for psychological research (because dreams occupy an important position in modern psychology).</p>
<p>The above picture is Viollier's work.</p>

<p>(1) The Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Entomology is located in Hangzhou, on the mountain, using the old site of the Li Gong Ancestral Hall, backing onto mountains and facing water, with both the beauty of West Lake and proximity to farmland, making it ideal for research.</p>
<p>(2) The Insect Taxonomy Research Laboratory is the most important organ of the Bureau of Entomology. It has successively collected more than 50,000 specimens of insects of various orders and made more than 30,000 classified specimens. The number of specimens that have been identified has reached 5,000 species. Most were collected near West Lake, Tianmu Mountain, and Chuanshan. There is also a standard specimen of dragonfly, which is especially valuable.</p>
<p>(3) The work of the Insect Life History Research Laboratory is to breed various insects in order to observe and record their life habits on a daily basis, which is fundamental to prevention and control.</p>
<p>(4) The work situation of the model room is that the products are precise and beautiful, comparable to imported products.</p>
<p>(5) The Plant Pathology Research Laboratory illustrates and examines the situation of bacterial spores.</p>
<p>(6) In the rice fields near Dongdai, Nanxun, Wuxing, with an area of more than 10,000 mu, according to the guidance of the Bureau of Entomology, the practice of watering and rotting rice roots in the winter of the previous year caused all the rice stem borers hiding in the rice roots to die, greatly reducing the damage. The rice crop was lush and had a complete bumper harvest. Standing in the rice field is Director of the Bureau of Entomology, Ms. Zou Shunu.</p>
<p>(7) The color is white, similar to , and it is one of the important pests of mulberry trees. It spreads in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Its damage is most severe in autumn. If there are no prevention and control measures, it will be difficult to obtain autumn silkworm feed. If the damage is too severe, the spring silkworms in the coming year will also be greatly affected. The above shows the damage to mulberry trees in the Hangzhou area, where the entire tree has only the veins left.</p>
<p>(8) Cordyceps sinensis was originally a specialty of Sichuan. Now it has been collected in Lingyin Temple. The insect (the larva of a cicada in the picture) can turn into grass (a kind of fungus, not real grass), and it is difficult for grass to turn into insects. People in the past thought that it could transform between winter and summer, but now it is confirmed that this is a fallacy. Small wasps are the great enemy of pests.</p>
<p>The larvae of moths are parasitized by a kind of parasitic wasp. The white things in the picture are the larvae of the parasitic wasp that have just hatched and are emerging from the parasite's skin.</p>

<p>Insect bodies are small and easily overlooked by us. However, it is not known that the number of known species of insects in the animal kingdom is about 600,000, and the number of unknown species is no less than several million. The total number accounts for four-fifths of the entire animal kingdom. We encounter insects everywhere in our daily life. Mosquitoes, flies, and bed bugs are present in warm weather, and lice and fleas are present in cold weather. They not only disturb our sweet dreams and cause suffering to our skin, but also can transmit extremely terrible diseases. Our fresh food can produce maggots, and stored items have clothes moths, bookworms, and woodworms. There are ants in the house, gadflies on cattle, horseflies on horses, and farmland and forests are even more active places for pests. History tells of locusts, and recently there are dreaded rice stem borers. Those that harm afforestation are pine caterpillars. The above examples are just a small fraction of the pests. We have never paid attention to these kinds of insects, and although they cause harm, we are almost accustomed to it. Now that civilization is advancing and survival competition is increasing, insect pests have a war with humans. Not only is it impossible to save every grain of rice that falls to the ground as before, but also without seeking profit, humans will not be able to survive. Therefore, the war between humans and insects is an essential element for survival. The key to warfare is to know yourself and your enemy. As for humans, the enemy is insects. There are so many kinds of insects, and countless kinds of insects, more than 600,000 species, can cause harm. Distinguishing their species and differences is insect taxonomy. Understanding the insect body structure is insect morphology. Various insects have different living habits and occurrences, which is the study of insect life history. If you don't know the insect, you can't control the insect. Knowing its type but not knowing its morphology and life also cannot control the insect. If you know its morphology and life, you should know how to cultivate, store, and protect the things that insects harm, so you cannot control the insect. From this deduction, the breadth and depth of entomology can be imagined.</p>
<p>Our country does not pay attention to entomology, so the sayings about wasps, silkworm moths, rice stem borers, and locusts are ancient and inconsistent. There are even people who say, "Why bother about the gains and losses of insects? This is a petty skill that strong men do not do." The neglect of entomology can be imagined. Our country lacks rice and wood, and we have to rely on imports everywhere. Although there are many reasons, the rampant insect pests are also one of the biggest reasons. Our country has never had a precise survey of insect pests. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Entomology estimated that the loss of rice field insect pests in Zhejiang Province in the 18th year of the Republic of China was about 200 million yuan. The Jiangxi Provincial Bureau of Entomology estimated that the loss of rice field insect pests in Jiangxi Province in the 18th year of the Republic of China was about 190 million yuan. These are all accurate surveys and low estimates, and the total number is already very alarming. Our country is more than just Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. If the loss of insect pests across the country can be recovered by one-half, then domestic and foreign debts can be paid off in one fell swoop, and various public works can be carried out at the same time. This is just the harm caused by insects. As for the benefits, our country's silk production occupies the most important position in the world. Now compared with Japan, we are behind. Our country also has a history of beekeeping for thousands of years, but the production of honey and beeswax in the world is insignificant. Sichuan insect white wax used to be famous, but now even if there is production, it has almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Entomology in the summer of the 13th year of the Republic of China, it has been six years since it has dedicated itself to controlling insects. Farmers in various parts of the province have begun to recognize the Bureau of Entomology as an organization for eliminating pests. The organization of the bureau is divided into insect taxonomy research, insect life history research, plant pathology research, insecticide and sterilization drug research, model making, photography, and secretarial affairs. It is managed by three technicians, three technical assistants, five assistant staff, twelve control staff, fourteen trainees, and eight clerical staff. In addition, control stations are set up in Jiaxing, Yongjia, Guanxi, and other places for research, investigation of pests, and timely guidance and control. During the 14th year, Haiyan County sent personnel to guide the setting of moth traps, and its harvest was more than 30% higher than that of neighboring counties, which is the most obvious result of insect control. In the 18th year, personnel were sent to 75 counties throughout the province, reaching more than 250 times. The early harvest and bumper harvest this year was due to assistance in prevention and control. Last year, the bureau trained 41 insect control personnel from various counties, who returned to their respective counties to guide and organize insect control committees, which have now been established. Fifty-two kinds of publications have been published and distributed to various counties, totaling 10 million copies. The achievements of the past two years have been displayed at the West Lake Exposition and the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Exhibition. More than 30,000 insect specimens have been collected and made over the years, including more than 140 species of butterflies in West Lake, which is especially complete. There are more than 300 kinds of plant pathology specimens. The research and records of the life history of insects in Zhejiang Province have been completed for more than 50 species, and three kinds of academic journals and more than 20 kinds of monthly reports have been published. Among them, those that are included in the British Insect Review magazine are especially commended by readers for the Illustrated Explanation of the Rice Stem Borer Control Monthly Decree. Reprints and transcriptions have been common. All general staff members, except for the appointment of senior staff, are trained by the bureau over the years. Zou Shuwen</p>
