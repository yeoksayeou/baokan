<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界商業之厄運</h3>
<p>世界商業之不振。其第一原因。固由於機械日精。出數多而供過於求之。故其次乃由歐戰以後。世界金融枯竭。購買力普遍减少。又其次乃由工人之覺悟。爭求待遇而貨物之成本以增。此皆自然之趨勢而無可如何。至於今日。則其因更多。其一·爲各國之殖民地。原爲各國之唯一銷貨商塲。今以爭求自由不得之故。而騷亂不止。因之貨物之銷行。更形阻礙而商業益無可措手。其二·世界用銀之國。雖不甚多。而類皆爲銷貨之地而非出貨之地。今金貴銀賤。日進不已。一貨之值。已倍於昔。因之商業不僅日落。且生擾亂。有此二因。商業國雖强且富。智謀敏捷而深遠。而對於今日之商業。欲救其衰落而返於興盛之途。一時實無能爲力</p>
<p>總之今日商業之有厄運。非僅商業本身之一端成之。乃由於各種環境而然。故環境一時不能變易則此厄運之商業一時即無從挽救。况此環境即或變易。而此機械日精。出貨日速而日多之原則不變。則一時一地商業雖有較佳之時。而其究極之終於無可挽救。仍意中事也。</p>

<p>「今天爲本部成立第一週年紀念日、大家能夠在這裏來慶祝、能夠大規模的來慶祝、大家一定非常的歡幸、但是慶祝與歡幸的意義、大家也有深切的認識、同時更該依着認識的一點、加倍去努力纔對、我們還記得、我們海軍部是在軍閥鐵蹄之下犧牲過的、他存心要摧殘我們、把海軍部改做海軍署、又把海軍署改爲海軍處、一步步來消滅我們、最後的分際、索性把海軍也消滅凈盡了、水止機關不讓我們存在、連部裏的官佐、都讓他趕得一乾二凈、没有一個存在於北平、一直到了國民革命軍北伐時、本軍將士極努力地和軍閥反革命以及帝國主義者奮鬥到底、所以中央政府察看着對内對外的一切情勢、認爲有趕設海軍部的必要、所以去年設今天、政府毅然决然的下令、把海軍部的立起來、現在算是已經一年過去了、我們所以有這麽的一天、可以說是大家努力所得的結果、換句話來說、憑着我們大家的努力、可以把海軍部成立起來、要是今天以後我們再不努力了、那末海軍部的倒坍、也就不可避免、就像北平的海軍部、所以終於倒坍的、固然是軍閥壓迫我們、其實一半也爲的已往的海軍部站在北平的腐敗政府之下、受其空氣包圍不免沾染了他們惡劣的習慣、先有了自取滅亡的因、所以纔容易發生這個果、現在這個站在國民政府下的海軍部、到底能夠存在與否、也就看我們大家的努力吧、這一年以來的工作、部裏頭已經做好了總報告、不久就可出版、現在簡單報告一下、成部以來、對於規章的訂立、很費了各官長的籌劃、大家不分寒暑、無問晝夜的、把一切的規制草創起來、所有應興應革的、都已劃定、所以一年以來、才能夠成就這麽多的成績、同時在近些時候之間、我們造了好幾個的軍艦、修繕和改製的還不算在内、而最近所計劃的逸仙軍艦、現在正在趕製、打算趕在下半年總理生辰紀念日可以舉行下水典禮、這一艦有一千六百噸、比從前所造的更大得許多、我們能夠造成這一艘的軍艦、都是靠在克勤克儉和積撙而來的錢、至於在軍各艦艇的砲力、我們這些時也已經把他補充得十分的充足、百且不花很多的錢、同時更以全副的精神、注意於訓練和敎育、艦隊方面、去年舉行過大規模的會操、有許多的艦艇都騰出工夫來參加會操、那些來不及參加的艦艇、也就各在自己的防次、操練各種的戰術和操演、對於士兵的訓練、我們的練營裏、有五百名的練兵、一百名的信號兵、共計六百名、都正在趕緊訓練之中、其原在艦艇服務的士兵、把他一班一班抽調出來、去學習槍砲魚雷以及電機管電等等、每一門設立一個練習班讓他們去練習、把他們訓練得成就、對於一般的官員、平時總鼓勵着大家望前去求知識、前一回派出了八個官員、十二個學生、到英國去學海軍、今年遂計劃着要派出幾批的學生、到英國和日本去、原有的海軍學校、我們把他們的規制和章程一一改良起來、認眞方法招考學生、招下一百名的新生、現在也已經開課了、這對於部員、就本部成立以來、部内的工作部份而說、在艦隊方面、自從成部以來、調動艦隊、努力於作戰剿匪以及保衛地方、不止在長江方面、隨你那一處、都依賴着海軍替他們保護安寧、就是閩洋浙洋、以及近粤的海面、也没有一處、不是由着我們的艦艇來剿滅共産黨和土匪、我們也是極努力底望前去幹、剛纔所說造艦的進行、逸仙軍艦以外、我們還計劃着把民生民族兩軍艦趕緊造成、好讓他凑上了民權、實現了三民主義的三民、現在民生這一艘、今年秋天就可興工了、本席剛纔很簡單報告我們的工作、有此成績者、實皆各部分官長曁各員始終努力所致、這過去一年中、因楊部長兼理福建省府主席、中間又生病、所以不能到部治事、均由本席代理、本席才幹又不足、所以今天祗有此報告、我相信倘部長如果親自在部辦事、則這一年之中、工作報告成績、一定還要多此十倍、此後列希望我們的官長職員和全軍將士們、更要一心一德的格外努力、那末憑着我們朝氣方盛的氣槪、怕不要一年比一年多了許多的成績呢、在這裏本席希望大家本着親愛精誠、繼續已往的奮鬥去努力不顧困難、不怕艱苦這纔是我們革命海軍的本色、此乃本部對於全軍抱着極熱烈的希望、亦就是本席個人所希望於我官佐士兵者、」</p>

<h3>日本裁判政策</h3>
<p>裁判員之横混直賴</p>
<p>（瞿自東京寄）</p>
<p>日本人之於運動、有死工夫而無活天才、對於田徑各項、須經長期練習者、頗有可觀、至於籃球排球足球等、簡直有天然的缺陷、本屆遠東大會、我國艦排球之實力、遠非日本所能望其項背、而日本於比賽時、乃異想天開實行其「裁判政策」以濟其窮何謂「裁判政策、」此係對於日本人獨有的名詞、請以下列事實說明之、</p>
<p>中日籃球比賽時、日本體育協會、請一不見經傳的某僻縣之小學體育敎員爲裁判員其裁判時、似曾受他人指使、臨時編訂有一新奇的籃球規則、凡中國隊員運球時一與日本隊員相接觸、即以中華隊員犯規論罰、一球兩球不等任意定之、如是者凡四十分鐘、日本竟「以敗爲勝」</p>
<p>遠東大會第三日（二十六日）下午三時、中日比賽排賽、日本以爲香港之「裁判政策」收效今日更變本加厲、請一姓原名六郎者爲裁判員、其人年約五十左右、粗俗異常、以其常識論、似未曾畢中學業、裁判時、專以混賴爲能事、日本隊發球、我軍反擊、每一觸球、即指爲觸網（Touchnet）或指爲停球（Hoesie）我軍發球得點時、即指爲犯規而取銷、其禁令多於牛毛而日本從不一犯如是者凡數十次、觀衆大譁、日本人之稍有知識者皆有些看不過去、記者隣座爲日本新聞記者團、每於原六郎混賴時、即相率詈曰、「這太不像話、」而原六郎仍頑詐如故、我選手屢向之質問他殭然不知所答幸得我國排球敎練趙善惟劉權達二君勸解、謂大會競技爲國家榮譽所關、彼旣横混直賴是自汚損其國家體面、吾人隠忍自重可也、日本東京靑年會西幹事布朗（Brown）氏亦在塲、當語人曰、「日本在本屆大會、原可獲勝、吾人深爲欽賀、但有此一裁判員、日本之名譽掃地、此美國移民法之所以有「紳士條例」也、此種不滿於裁判員之空氣、已瀰漫全塲其後一解事之日本某君、乘機私予原六郎以暗示、原六郎作僞心虚、自知不妥其勢稍歛、而第二第三兩盤、我軍遂皆以二十一對八大勝日本實力之弱於此可以反證、若非原六郎之不公正、純以技能相比日本非「零敗」不可、因爲果如原六郎之所爲、則比賽之勝負、不决於選手之優劣僅一裁判員足矣、比賽畢記者爲調查原六郎之出身履歷、親詢之大會職員柳田亨君、問「原六郎是自何處請來、」柳田君有難色遲遲答曰「他不是東京人」你們已經嬴了、算了吧、」記者曰「我甚佩服原六郎之爲人、因爲他很愛國呀」柳田君苦笑不答、夫「愛國」必先「顧臉、」「丢臉」即以「辱國」若原六郎者直「丢臉」而已、「辱國」而已、吾爲日本惜、吾爲日本羞</p>
<p>東京爲日本首都、人材鼎盛、風氣較開、而排球之裁判員必求之於僻鄉之原六郎、日本體育恊會畢竟别有一番用意吾無以名之、謹名之曰「日本之裁判政策」</p>
<p>由來雙方比賽、此方不滿於彼方之裁判員者、總含有誤會與遷怒之成份、本文係當場屬稿因當時非常憤慨、多有偏感情之字句、亦似有「非紳士」之嫌、後曾加以刪改、日本裁判政策之醜態尙未十分揭露、故文責我敢自負</p>
<h3>中菲女排球第一次賽</h3>
<p>（許民輝自東京寄）</p>
<p>結果二對○中勝</p>
<p>中華劈球固甚好</p>
<p>但不知攻人弱點</p>
<p>第一局女子排球表演中菲第一次比賽、於二十四日下午一時舉行女子排球表演賽、於明治神宫外苑排球場、是役也、中菲兩國相戰、兵刄旣啟、中國娘子軍、英勇異常、隊長鄧志豪發球猛烈、菲島女將、只有招架之工、並無還槍之力、中將壓劈、前鋒順利、聨絡工夫、頗爲純熟、一帆風順、即造成五對零、惜鄧氏一時大意、竟二次失誤將球送與對方、幸諸將奮勇、即將發　權奪回而李粹美繼之而起其發球之猛烈、不遜於鄧、故亦直落五、紀錄爲十與零、球始爲菲女奪去、未幾又復奪回、吕君發球、勢亦不弱、得一分後、即須易地面戰、敵隊見勢不佳、挺身而起、奮臂而鬭、取得一分、又經幾次惡戰、頗得勝利、惟前半局所負太多、大勢已去、無可挽回、故中華隊率以二十一比八獲勝、停戰一分鐘、即繼以</p>
<p>第二局　中華隊旣勝一局、則嬌傲散漫、陣勢大亂、竟爲菲隊所乘、而至八與四比、十一與七比、菲島占優勢·時隊卝有慌亂不知所措者、比數乃增至十三與八、旁觀者代爲憂之、幸隊長機警、即宣佈停戰、一方面可以减低敵軍銳氣、一方面亦可討論戰策、改變方法、重整旗鼓、於是復回原氣、司徒薇首立奇功連獲三分、蕭慧靈再接再勵連衆五元、遂以十六比十三占先、士氣更爲之振奮、華僑紛援、亦常常納喊助威、菲隊雖死力相抗、然卒亦無效、其結果爲二十一比十七、我隊勝、</p>
<p>是役也、我隊劈球甚好、舉球亦頗得當、惟稍欠準確、不知攻敵人之弱點、且救球略差、又常有不正當發球之弊、且屢有二次失敗、而將球送與對方者、此皆我隊之弱點也、此外勝則輕敵、旣敗而慌、他日與我競、敵日隊相戰、若不將此弱點除去、恐因此而至失敗也、勉哉諸君、（五月廿四晚）</p>

<h3>日菲棒球第一次賽</h3>
<p>（錢華）</p>
<p>十比四日本勝</p>
<p>東京通訉日本對菲列濱棒球初賽、於二十五日下午二時半在棒球塲舉行、是日因值禮拜、天氣快晴、且日人見自國代表隊出場觀衆蝟集、門票沽盡、塲内幾無立足地、實爲六大學棒球聨會、早慶戰後、空前盛况、球審池田壘審三宅、天知、藤田由菲隊先攻、</p>
<p>得日二八○○○○○○Ａ十</p>
<p>點菲○○○一○二○一○四</p>
<p>一二三局、菲軍因宫武投手之球速多變、難以捉摸、毫無進展、日隊開始攻擊、則獲兩分、殆第二局時、更爲所欲爲、擊球如意、一舉連奪五分、實力技倆、相差遠甚、斯時空中一片黑雲、俄頃沛然大雨、比賽轉宣佈中止、經田十分鐘後、雨止續行、菲隊調換投手、仍不克阻遏、日軍攻勢頻見滿壘、形狀多危、此局日本獲取八分、大勢早决、是後宫武因蓄氣力、球勢減銳、故菲軍乘機反攻上位打者五人、均得安打、於四六八局中、先後奪還四分、結果日本以十比四大勝、</p>

<h3>大會花絮錄</h3>
<p>異曲同工應援歌　籃球場中華應援團、每當選手進場或得點時必羣起歡唱、或呼口號、與菲律賓比賽時、菲軍亦起而應之、華軍新變花樣、臨時以一二三四五五四三二一等數字、調入歌譜唱之而菲軍亦不弱以ＡＢ反復歌之、於是Ａ」Ｂ」ＡＡＡ」ＢＢＢ」ＢＡ」ＡＢ」ＢＢＢＢＢ」聽者莫不絶倒、</p>
<p>不由的淚流滿面　有某兩女校、在場表演籃球、結果甲勝乙敗、乙軍悲憤異常、退場後、即共坐草地上、相對唏嘘飲泣、又某兩女校表演時、一女生胸部被打痛、亦大放悲聲、此亦未始非一種點綴</p>
<h3>中日乓乒戰</h3>
<p>團體個人日本優勝</p>
<p>中華表演十分良佳</p>
<p>中華在沼津獲勝</p>
<p>（東京通訊）乒乓隊于二十四日到東京、二十五日舉行個人比賽、二十六日舉行團體比賽開會首由城戶報告、次有伯爵有馬氏演說、鐘鳴十時、裁判員銀角一聲、鼓掌如雷、力戰五小時、個人錦標始告成功、爲日本隊村林氏所得、團體賽、共分五組其結果及球藝詳錄於下、</p>

<p>（四）陸修律　福士　○對三</p>
<p>（五）陸愼桐　藤村　一對○</p>
<h3>中勝足球戰右鋒陳家球傳球與戴麟經之情形</h3>
<p>周健文不幸適值得個人錦標之村林、村林爲全日本之精華、抽守相宜、個人與福士决賽時、連抽四十六下之多福士竟回擊之、結果而取勝于福士、足見其球藝精矣、周之敗北、亦當然也事、盧仲球與森田、森田爲大阪個人錦標、抽擊並佳、在大阪己打敗數千健將、今盧君竟以抽球勝之、爲我國乓乒界之新記錄也、黃祥發與相澤、黄祥發雖敗、然其成績尙不乏老將之名、陸修律與福士、因福士球藝精良、陸雖盡力抽擊、無隙可入、陸愼桐與藤村、陸素善近回、按國人之眼光、定能取勝於日、不意是日完全失常、回球頗高失球較多、彼方抽守得法、遂致敗北、總觀是日比賽、中國隊倘以推測得當、能將健將列於後面·則其結果必佳、國人素以守球著名、是日竟多抽球、頗爲日人所驚暵、日本完全死守、以逸待勞、且中華隊長途勞頓、火車中全夜未睡、僅休息一日、即應赴戰、其敗者非戰之罪、觀乎沼津之戰、即可證明矣、二十六日比賽完畢、由日本乓乒會會長有馬伯爵開懇親會、日本隊多發表其親善意見、中華隊林澤蒼俞斌祺亦發輝國人之大意、直至日暮、始行告辭、</p>
<p>又訊中、華乓乒隊、東京比賽完畢、於二十八日上午乘火車赴横浜相近沼津市、與該地選手比賽、其結果加下、</p>

<p>爲請收回安插藥業失業職工事</p>
<p>商整會爲請求中央請願收回安插藥業失業職工事經全體委員會議、公推虞洽卿·葉惠鈞·王延松·王曉籟·聞蘭亭等五委員爲代表、向京滬各黨政機關陳請茲五代表對於本市市黨部市政府方面、已經一再洽商、得有相當解决辦法、昨晚即乘車赴京、分向中央黨部·國民政府·工商部請願茲錄請願呈文如下、呈爲藥業失業職工、擬改由屬會商民藥業團體自行介紹、免照審查名單、　安插以其兼顧而泯糾紛、仰祈鑒核示遵事、案查本市藥業同業公會、以中央對於藥業、因安插失業職工、糾紛未决一案、擬定辦法六條之中、惟替工制度一條、事實上已無存在之可能、由各家按照黨部審查合格名單、安插六十四人以上、認爲仍含有强制之性質、與店方營業生存有莫大關係、仍請轉呈收回成命等情、當於本月十六日轉呈在案、本市各業團體、以此事日久、迄未有適當解决、而各業職工準備繼起者、風聲已日緊一日、萬不得已、不能不籌商應付之法、於是除上次四十四團體、連名函請召集各業代表大會之外、其繼續以此爲請者、又有十五同業公會、屬會鑒於商情之日益激昂、爰於本月（五月）二十二日·二十三日·召集第十三次全體會議提出討論·僉以各業恐慌、全因藥業而起、而藥業此次之糾紛、</p>
<p>中</p>
<p>央擬定辦法六條、其最重要之一條、定爲限令錄用調解委員會審查合格之職工·其人數約在六十四人以上等語、夫儘先錄用與强制安插之異點、不在於所用之名詞而在於實際上店方有無自行酌量之主權今限定六十四人以上、則名額多少、店方無自行减縮之權勢非如以前之每店容納幾人不可、限令以調查委員會密查合格爲限、則其中雖有習性不良、技能拙劣者、店方亦無否認之權是店方事實丄果能需要此多人與否、其人員究竟適當於否直絲毫無支配考慮之餘地、名稱上即使仍用錄用字樣、而其精神上實爲强制性質、</p>
<p>本市當局已有强制執行之表示、平情考慮與强制安插、實無絲毫區别之處、</p>
<p>國府批示、旣認定强制安插爲未合、藥業自不能不根據此項批示請求救濟、此對於限令錄用審查合格在六十四人以上之一條、不能不請求收回成命者以此也並查工會法第二十七條、工會不能限制雇主用其所介紹之人易言之、即不能强制介紹是也此項規定、原爲保全店方之用人主權起見强制安插字面上縱有岐異、而性質上寳無區别一言以蔽之、凡爲妨礙店方用人之主權者、俱爲法律所不許、</p>

<p>運湘貨品銳減　上星期起、滬上裝往長沙湘潭岳州等處之去貨、乃一落千丈、而沙市方面之出口營業亦銳退、日本船之在湖南方面行駛者、已電滬、請日海軍第一外遣隊、急派軍艦安宅號馳赴湘境護行矣、</p>
<p>上游客票跌價　太古怡和日清招商四公司議定上江船票價從、六月一日起共同跌價、業經擬訂新率如下、</p>

<p>忽然玩弄手槍　當李步入陳家門口竹籬時、瞥見邱之一子一女、正在門口小桌前晚膳、李走近桌前、與兩孩頻頻戲語、不知如何、忽然取出手槍玩弄、詎偶一不愼、誤觸機鈕、砰然一聲、彈珠脫槍而出、適射中邱子阿土右手、直入口内、洞穿後頸、待王氏聞聲趕出察查時、兩阿土均面無人色、邱子當即倒地、移時斃命、</p>
<p>兇手乘間逃逸　王氏見愛子飲彈而亡、隨即將李扭住呼救、陳氏老孀婦亦聞警趕出、李阿土遂於此時乘間逸去、同時邱亦歸家、聞耗失色、當即投報善鐘路捕房、捕頭聞訊、立邓飭探往查、復跟蹤至李家宅、而李已杳如黄鶴矣、邱子屍身、報候今日檢騐、</p>

<h3>引言張之江</h3>
<p>本期特刋。承黨國諸同志。錫以嘉言。珠玉紛披。嘉惠民衆。實非淺尠。兄弟謹代表禁烟委員會。深爲致謝。</p>
<p>禁烟工作。一方固然是在政府機關。切實施禁。一方却全靠民衆覺悟。自動戒除。雙方合作。始可冀收全功。過去的時光。問禁烟的成績。固然。政府機關。萬分抱愧。但民衆方面。除拒毒團體。熱心奔走而外。總覺大多數尙在醉夢之中。這是多麽傷心可痛。却也難怪。若揆諸行易知難之學說。民衆尙未知。得怎能責備他們實行呢。</p>

<h3>今後實施禁烟之途徑</h3>
<p>王·伯·羣·</p>
<p>溯鴉片之爲害吾國。曆數百年。洎乎輓近。流毒益烈。視兵禍疫癘。殆有過之。嘗推吾民族積弱之原。其由於烟禍者。實爲最鉅。十餘年來。禁烟之令。不可謂不嚴。拒毒運動。不可謂不烈。然而頻年烟禍。反有加無已。不但内地各省。往往公開販賣。恃烟士爲利藪。即在通都大邑。亦復藏汚納垢。視禁令若具文。政府雖三令而</p>

<p>六三禁煙紀念焦　崇題</p>
<p>五申。烟民仍熟祝而無覩。長此以往。將陷吾民族於萬刦不復之境。嘗念國家建設。發軔之初。國民方當努力生産以蘄民生之發展。而鴉片乃摧殘吾民族之生産。力。以底於困窮。際此外侮日亟。國民方當鍜鍊躭體。以求種族之强盛。而鴉片乃斷喪吾民族之生活力。以即於衰弱。此實民族前途莫大之殷患。由斯知烟毒一日不清。則政治上一日難免腐惡。三民主義。亦一日不能完成。總理有言。「鴉片營業。絶對不能與吾人民所賦予權力之國民政府並立。」又言。「禁烟之要着。不但須禁種。且須禁賣。」旨哉斯言。爲今之計。欲澄清烟毒。惟有全國上下。併力共趨。以促成禁烟之澈底實現。一方面當求不平等條約之廢除。以絶外士之來源。一方面當厲行禁烟辦法。禁種。禁賣。禁吸。三者同時並進。犯者。當科以重刑。而不宜以罰金了事。致開方便之門。吾人尤當努力統一之完成。與交通開發。使内地各省之烟禍。亦得逐漸廓清「庶幾此吮血吃膏之毒物。永與中華民族絶緣。此實本會同人之責。而亦全國人民所馨香禱祝。以期其成者也。</p>

<h3>禁烟紀念特刊題詞</h3>
<p>孔祥熙</p>
<p>禁烟無他法。惟在决心兩字。政府旣早具决心矣。倘社會能以决心協力監督。試問運種者何能漏網。人民能以决心痛自戒絶。試問毒品何處銷售。所以能决心禁烟雖不言。禁而自禁。不能决心禁烟。雖日日言禁。而終不能禁茲值禁烟紀念日。敢以此爲國人告尙望深加猛省</p>
<h3>禁烟之感想張·我·華·</h3>
<p>禁烟委員會同人以現屆六三紀念之期。　爲擴大宣傳起見。擬發禁烟特刋。徵言我我華。謹按</p>
<p>總理有言。如有以鴉片爲營業者。爲民意之公敵。賣國之行爲。大哉言乎。吾人服膺</p>
<p>總理遺敎。對此最沉痛最嚴厲之訓詞。如不共籌根本辦法。澈底肅清。何以完成。總理掃除烟禍未竟之志。槪自鴉片流入中國。百有餘年。病國病民。莫此爲甚。不但經濟上受莫大之影響。即人種亦因之日就衰弱。東亞病夫之譏評。此爲最大原因。民國以來。屢頒禁烟條例雷厲風行。不啻三令五申。乃禁者自禁。而種者如故　　禁烟紀念日特刋題辭</p>
<p>哀　同胞沈淪黑籍九幽沈沈不見天日</p>

<p>。運者如故。售者吸者如故。匪特不能廓清毒氛。且繼長增高。有加無巳。推厥原因。一則軍閥時代。名雖設立禁烟機關。實則弁髦法令。並勸令民間種烟。以吸取不法收入。甚且勒令各縣須種烟苗若干畝。過額者有奬。不及額者處罰。在上者之貪婪凟職。如此。一則奸商土販。以軍警爲護符。士棧也。烟館也。包運烟士也。始猶秘密爲之。繼竟公然無忌。不肖官吏。勾結分肥。熟視無覩。即間有認眞查禁之員。亦孤掌難鳴。畏勢而莫敢誰何。在下者之玩視烟禁又如此。可勝浩歎。但此爲過去之事實。方今國府有禁烟委員會之設置。一切禁烟法令至周且密。無待贅言。夫禁烟以禁種禁運禁售禁吸四種爲要素夫人而知之。矣而禁種禁運售。尤爲根本之圖。誠能依法嚴懲種戶。實行剷除烟苗。對於運售奸商。嚴密搜查。勿使幸逃法網。則來源已斷吸戶不禁自絶。所望禁烟行政人員。及全國拒毒同志。本除惡務盡之决心。實行國府禁烟政策。監視各地禁烟官吏。努力進行。民衆方面。已吸者實心戒除。未吸者互相勸免。以堅强剛毅之力。掃除烟禍。以期實現。</p>
<p>總理拒毒之遺訓。此則我華所馨香禱祝者也。昔林文忠鑒於烟禍之盛行。曾有此禍不除數十年後中國無可用之兵無可籌之餉等語。遂斷然處分嚴辦包庇洋土之汚吏。舉英人運入烟士。悉付一炬。浩氣英風。至今永留紀念。我同人本革命精神。抱强種觀念。比諸前賢。豈遑多讓。肅清烟禍。庶幾拭目俟之。</p>
<h3>論紀念林則徐王·維·藩·</h3>
<p>非革命時代之人物。而被國民政府永留紀念者。一爲八月二十七日之孔子誕生。一爲六月三日之林則徐焚燬英士。孔子大同主義。立革命之極軌。允宜紀念無論矣。林公一清臣耳。獨其處於非革命啊之環境。而能不顧利害。實行與帝國主義抗鬥。與鴉片作殊死戰。皆爲吾革命同志。所懸以爲鵠。而愧未逮焉者。此誠足以爲吾黨同志之模範。此國民政府所以規定。禁烟紀念日也。雖然。上下數千年。惟林公特能與孔子并見隆重於革命時代之今日。於戲。林公亦榮矣哉。</p>
<h3>一年來之烟禁鍾·可·託·</h3>
<p>光陰易逝歲月不居。今年六三禁烟紀念日。相距去歲六三林則徐先生九十週年紀念日。忽已屆一載矣。在茲過去一年時期之中。關於禁政若何。此固國人所欲共知。而不佞服務烟禁機關。亦最欣願公聞也。茲逢本年六三禁烟紀念。發行特刋之日。爰不憚詞碎。一爲全國父老兄弟姊妹報告焉。</p>
<p>總理拒毒遺訓有言曰。「對鴉片之言戰絶對不可妥協」。本會在此過去一年中。雖因軍事頻興。環境惡劣。一切措施。未能按諸計劃。全部實行。但仍本着拒毒精神。未敢稍弛。現僅就過去之一年烟禁。舉其重要者包刮言之。凡有九事</p>
<p>鶯粟流毒甚於決川　　　　舉國奄　　髙振響喚起冥頑　　　絶　裔乃全</p>
<p>琅</p>
<p>（一）關於禁烟方針者　去歲曾擬定訓政時期工作。分配年表。對於禁烟工作如何支配及進行。均詳載列表内。現仍在中央政治會議審查之中。一俟核准。即當循序實施矣。此外如禁烟法施行規則之規定。應設各省。市禁烟委員會。及各重要口岸查緝處。無非爲圖早日肅清烟禍。以資督飭起見。雖經擬具上項組織規程送院。但</p>
<p>值軍事方興。限於經濟。因之組設。尙稍有待。然總勢在必行也。</p>
<p>（二）關於烟禁法規者計有十餘件（甲）禁烟法（乙）禁烟法施行規則（丙）公務員調騐規則（丁）禁烟考績條例（戊）縣長履勘烟苗章程（己）檢查舟車飛機私運烟士辦法（庚）各地戒烟所曁地方醫院兼理戒烟事宜章程（辛）禁烟罰金充奬規則（壬）六三禁烟紀念日紀念辦法（癸）審議告發文件簡章。以上各法規。包括禁止種運售吸鴉片辦法至鉅。自頒布以來。遂漸見諸實行。近以一事所可證明者。閩西各縣素爲産土之區。近經海軍陸戰隊林壽國旅長會同各縣縣長剷除烟苗一萬餘畝。以此徵往。可見訂定禁烟法規收效之宏也。（三）關於調騐公務員者迭望首都各機關函復。均經分别舉行調騐。其中有吸烟嫌疑者共八十八人。業已隨時停職。其他各省市。亦皆次第辦理。附具各員切結。函報到會。現爲杜絶弊竇起見。擬仍舉行抽查覆騐。藉肅官箴。而頭名副以身作則之實也。</p>
<p>（四）關於戒烟工作者　現已通咨各省市政府。轉飭限期成立戒烟醫院。以資烟民自首入院戒除。而示政府示忍不敎而誅之至意。約在最短期間。必可陸續成立。此亦烟民之福音也。對於戒烟醫院經費。并另規定。由罰金内提出二成以充之。其查獲烟犯。於未判罪以前。須先送入醫院戒烟。蓋爲防其罪滿出獄後。仍其嗜好。不得不籌根本清除之謀。并又佈告民間。限期呈繳收藏之烟具。以備彙齊焚燬。而作根本肅清也。</p>
<p>（五）關於調查烟禁者　初經派員分赴東三省蘇皖贛浙鄂粤桂魯陜川等省。調查各地烟禁狀况。其辦理廢弛之各地。隨據報告加以糾正。繼又派員分往福州厦門濟南青島等處。調查日籍浪人縱毒禍華。并輸運麻醉毒品情形。即經檢同證據。彙報國際聨盟曁公布於中外各報。已獲國聨重視我國禁烟之决心。現又通過一致遵守海牙公約之協定。此皆收上述調查之效。茲擬仍派專員前赴國聨。共同研究國際鴉片問題。以資應付也</p>
<p>（六）關於考核各省烟政者　迭經通咨各省市政府。按照禁烟考績條例之規定。切實舉行考核。其有已准彙報到會者。已按其塡列考績。分别實施奬懲所謂以賞有功而儆不力也。</p>
<p>（七）關於烟案控案者　其烟案統計已於各期公報詳細發表。毋待再叙。至控案統計。總合一年來計有八百餘件。内分情節較得得二百餘件。情節較輕者六百餘件。祇須控告手續完全。固無不受理也。</p>
<p>（八）關於國際方面者　現以國際禁烟委員會。定於八月開特會。並於十二月一日召集國際限制麻醉藥品會議於日内瓦。關係我國烟禁問題甚鉅亟宜力籌應付。茲正會同内政衛生外交各部準備提案。最低希望工界麻醉藥品産量限制。至醫藥用度。其含有麻醉藥品之成藥。國聨亦甚注意。并已洽商衛生部按照成藥規則。加以取締矣。</p>
<p>（九）關於黨政軍合作者　黨權高於一切舉國人士。咸知本會爲實施禁政計。曾有呈請中央通飭各級黨部監督所在地方政府。厲行烟禁。殆實希望早日廓清烟禍。藉黨權而督飭之。以免懈弛也。此外如咨請内政部。通飭水陸公安機關。取締處罰烟犯及咨請軍政部。通令各地駐軍檢查所。不得擅自没收查獲烟士。皆爲裨益烟禁之圖也。</p>
<p>綜上所述。不過舉其關於一半烟禁禁重要者。其他關於烟禁範圍瑣屑事件更屬僕難勝數。曾經按月塡列詳細報告呈送府院備案。惟以限於特刋篇幅。未能縷叙事。雖明日黄花非若平淡無奇。幸望國人勿以漠然視之。今後所冀本政府與人民合作之精神。持共同奮鬥之毅力。對於六三禁烟紀念日。時時印諸腦海。刻刻置諸不忘則百年流毒。何患不澈底肅清。對外不平等條約。何慮不尅期廢除。而本會在茲一年過去之烟禁籌劃。殫心竭慮。亦不致付諸流水也。願與全國人士共勉之。</p>
<h3>拒毒遺訓</h3>
<p>圖未作</p>
<h3>六三紀念弁言陳·德·徵·</h3>
<p>我國對外締結不平等條約的開端。便是南京和約。南京和約的禍原。乃又屬於爲禍至烈的鴉片。所以我們努力革命者。應深深地感覺到。要想實行廢除不平等條約。第一步就要從禁絶鴉片與一切麻醉毒物這一方面做起。</p>
<p>鴉片與一切麻醉毒物的禍害。爲我國外交失敗内政不修土匪充斥奸佞横行的主要原因。流毒所至。必致亡國滅種。這是任何人所能知所能說的。然而禁者自禁賣者自賣。拒者自拒。吸者自吸。一直到現在還不能杜其根而斷其流。這歸咎還是我們全體國民没有眞正覺悟的原因。現在我們足跡的至。到處可以看到毒物的蔓延。在現在革命政府的統治之下。居然發現出來。這是我們不能不痛心疾首的。</p>
<p>近數十年我國人民爲吸食鴉片而致破家蕩産的。多得非常。社會經濟的基礎。日益動搖。危險的程度。能令我們不寒而慄。且從毒物之害方面着想。其損身心廢學業。好端端將强壯優秀的民族。換了一個東亞病夫。的徽號。又是何等的可怕。我們要圖强。我們要雪恥。我們要全體國民都能眞正覺悟起來。一致去拒絶毒物。是必須有負專責的機關。積極進行。庶幾可觀實效。</p>
<p>中華國民拒毒會。應了我們這個要求。去做這樣艱鉅而切要的工作。已經有了相當的成績。爲全國人士所推稱。其繼續着向前去努力精神。更加是我們所極爲推崇的。茲屆發行六三特刋。爲樂道數語。希望更作進步之努力。</p>

<h3>六三紀念與吾人應有之努力黄·嘉·惠·</h3>
<p>百餘年來帝國主義取攘奪併吞之手段。向弱小民族進攻。以圖經濟地位之優越。不惜流人之血。滅人之種。而爲計最酷爲心最忍者。莫鴉片政策若也。自英人以戰艦大砲之力。以鴉片輸入我國後。國弱民貧。以至近年來淪入次殖民地之地位。而英人以經濟侵略睡策之成功。不但四庫充盈。而在遠東之地位於以鞏固。是後舉凡各國向遠東發展者。亦莫不襲英人之餘唾。紛紛求靈於鴉片麻醉藥品收入之豐裕。慨乎。今日我國毒禍浸尋。有如洪水氾濫不可收拾。值此六三焚土紀念之日。吾人緬懐林公則徐之遺範。環顧國内毒禍之猖狂。不禁涕淚之滂沱。往事已矣。來日大難。吾人當思所以補救之道。挽此將倒之國運。今日經營國際鴉片與麻醉毒品者。英德法日諸巨魁之外。尙有渺小之瑞士荷蘭奥大利波斯土耳其等。不勝枚舉。莫不傾茯全力於我國。而在幕後操縱此醜業者。仍爲九十年前林公戰而未勝之雅片罪魁也。予春間以中華國民拒毒會命。曾游南洋各國殖民地。耳聞目擊之事實。深知殖民政策之成功。殖民政府之繁榮。均賴雅片貿易之收入。即以英荷二屬華僑吸烟稅率。每年已達國幣一萬三千萬元以上。而上年新加坡輸運出品之印波雅片。亦過一千九百萬兩之鉅。而銷用此等毒物者百之九十皆我國民也。吾人從事拒毒救國之運動。對此仇敵應有深切之認識。共下澈底之决心。步林公之後塵。對此亡國滅種之毒物進攻。而欲圖最後之成功。尤需打破此國際間非人道之陰謀。至於國内未清之毒苗。充斥之烟土。旣非靑天白日下之所能容。當上下一心。芟除凈盡。慶慰林公與總理在天之靈。而不虚年年此日之紀念乎。</p>
<h3>林公拒毒遺訓</h3>
<p>鴉片之毒。甚於洪水猛獸。天下萬世之人。斷無有以鴉片爲不必禁者…此禍不除。十年後。無可用之兵。無可籌之餉……鴉片流毒内地。如癰疽流毒人身。癰疽生則漸以成膿。鴉片來則漸以致寇。……必須將鴉片烟銷除凈盡。乃爲杜絶病根。</p>
<h3>六三紀念之名言讜論譚延闓</h3>
<p>雅片之害久矣。舉世沈酣獨林侯官起而掃除之。志雖不竟。至今猶在人耳目。虎虎有生氣。今政府方厲行烟禁。感念前哲。爰有闡揚。以示海内。先正蒞事之精誠。御外之方略。威令赫耀。有非今想像所及者。孰令我泄泄沓沓。束縛九十年搖手轉足不得哉。悲夫悲夫。雖無老成人。尙有典型。發憤有爲。猶所掌耳。</p>

<p>漢民生長粤東。童時即習聞人說林欽差燒雅片故事。稍長讀書。見紀載林公政績者甚衆。二十館於公外孫沈氏。常爲述公遺事。乃愈嚮往焉。論者謂公厲行烟禁。以申國權。除民瘼。無不當者。惟「貨則充公。人即正法」八字。持之過急。耳漢民初不知此八字於當時應用如何。及讀己亥九月十七二十一等批諭。方知外來商舶。必令具結。如犯烟禁。貨則充公。人即正法。各國於前四字巳遵允。所抗議者。惟「人即正法」而已。然公之持正不阿。大節凛凛足使百年以來自餒媚外者。聞而愧汗。滿清爾時舉朝闒葺。遇事畏葸已成風氣。而獨有此錚錚。尤爲難能。所謂持之少急。不當爲公病也公晚年。有就公問外事者。公曰英海國耳。異日爲中國患者。其俄羅斯乎。迨清末葉以來。公言遂若奇中。以公深識。用行塞外。耳目所屆。宜有先知。然非終身爲民族憂者。何以及此。公蓋非一時之能臣也。今國民於雅片之爲毒。已大覺醒。政府設立委員會。嚴治其事。且紀念公。回憶兒童時見聞。不勝其景慕與慨歎矣。</p>
<h3>王寵惠</h3>
<p>寵惠少時讀林文忠公政書。則知有雅片之戰。其後游學歐美。彼都人士。輒稱其爲人。而深惜清廷之直道不容焉。寵惠常疑之。謂自元初成吉斯汗。迄於文忠。意不在侵略。而在求伸公理者。則雅片之戰。實爲吾中國民族。與外人奮鬥之第一聲。然則文忠蓋富於排外思想者也。而外人反稱其賢。茲所謂公理者非耶。凡公理之戰。以是非爲重而成敗次之。苟敗非其罪。國人固不勝其惋愕之情。即外人亦從而駭詫而敬重其人之念以生。謂其致敗之由。自有尸其咎者。於若人無與焉。嗚呼。此豈排外之戰。所得而比擬哉。自茲役之敗。文忠以讒以死。雅片流毒。遂亘百年至於今日。尙煩政府禁錮之慮。追念文忠前事。豈惟吾國之不幸抑亦世界公理之未伸者。寵惠嘗讀西史。美洲波士頓之役。以反抗英人稅茶而起者也。其時美人以英舶所載。悉投諸海。其事與文忠投毁雅片絶相類。乃美則得一華盛頓。一戰而霸。離英獨立。至今號稱强國。我則失一林文忠。一戰而蹶。遂至不平等條約之束縛。滋益甚焉。嗚呼。雖有幸不幸。亦足見一國對外得人與否。其關繫蓋若斯之鉅也</p>
<h3>王正廷</h3>
<p>天生毒物。爲禍中土。幾使陷於亡國滅種。爲洪水猛獸第二之鉅患者。孰有甚於是。林則徐先生。於百年前。灼然知其遺害之大。出死力以拒之。卒以雅片戰爭一役。益暴露帝國主義省之慘無人道。使吾國千萬世後。回首往事。痛定思痛。猶有餘傷。此眞可謂功不在禹下也。吾嘗謂清室二百餘年。能知世界大勢者。先生一人而已。當時袞袞聾瞶卒懾於砲威。謫戌先生。而俛首言和。此誠與南宋猝召岳武穆班師。同爲千古之痛史也。今以受禍。過久且烈。世界引爲殷鑑。國人漸有知覺。由麻醉之時期。忽而大聲疾呼。拒毒運動。遂成普天義憤「加以革命告成。列强改觀。英人亦不敢過冒不韙。剝極而復。殆其時乎。是以自國府頒布先生焚土紀念日。而全國民衆。亦莫不聞風興起。一唱百和。舉行熱烈之紀念。以爲禁烟之盛大宣傳。誠足使烟禍之烈。永遠深刻於吾國人之腦際。垂爲炯戒也。</p>

<h3>金融休業中厘疲拆堅</h3>
<p>銅元又長二千</p>
<p>市塲槪况　前日爲國曆　節、照例休業一天、緣前日又值星期、故銀行方面照例須補停星期一日、遂致昨日外灘各銀行除中央外、均與平常之星期日相埒、而江海關亦照常收稅、銀行旣休業、稅欵收入亦殊寥寥耳、錢業市塲之銀拆稍堅、洋厘續疲云、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市爲七錢一分七厘七毫半、較上月底之價相鉅半厘、形勢甚軟、午市則又續小一毫二忽半、爲七錢一分七厘六毫二忽半、數日間已跌三五厘之巨矣、（銀拆）早市稍堅則爲二錢、午市改小三分、計爲一錢七分、銀行掛牌及劃頭加水均無市况、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市漲後反動</h3>
<p>獲利了結原棉仍昂尙能維持</p>
<p>紗市轉平、形勢略軟、實以連日上漲太烈、引起獲利者了結、市面遂生反動、但大跌風未曾發現、因原棉堅昂、廠商無利可圖、故情形尙能維持、一時不過多數目標暫時無穿出六十兩之可能、所以做空者尙不乏人、市氣轉向平靜之狀、市上實銷尙佳、總之底貨尙有、二十支五福牧羊呆紗走銷不動、故近月之價仍被其壓迫、賣方膽氣仍壯也</p>
<p>人標賣、戶突增　交易所人標前市開盤、以賣戶增、加市氣較鬆而跌、二三盤以達記·公泰·裕大三家大批賣出、包額較巨、市盤遂疲、結果各月均跌五、六·七錢午後市情仍平、因三品紗又跌四五元、人心尤疲塲中形勢軟化、各月漲跌一·三錢全日成交統計一萬七千零五十包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市日商與漢帮大賣下跌</h3>
<p>棉市反動驟起、實以漲風太速、引動日商及漢帮乘機大批賣出、包額殊巨、故市氣鬆懈、但多數散戶由空翻多、所以雖有大批售下、吸取者仍旺、故市情尙硬、如滙票稍鬆、棉市或有一度反動也、實銷廠胃仍滯、</p>
<p>漢標獲利了給　交易所漢標前市開盤、以獲利者了結、漢帮及日商大批賣出、市盤突落、跌三四錢、二三盤略漲、結果本月份因火機帮套賣跌四錢半、遠跌二錢至一錢五分、午後市况平定、各月漲跌五分玛一錢茲將盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉仍居滯鈍之局</h3>
<p>近來雨量過多須補種</p>
<p>大西洋諸州果蠱漸現</p>
<p>須料夏間有棉産恐慌</p>
<p>三十日紐約電告一間　棉市狀况云、棉産消息未有　人聽聞之處、本週棉花交易所之交易殊爲清淡、不良之貿易消息可抵銷棉産中任何不利之發展、近來雨量過多、密西西比州阿堪薩斯州及台克薩斯州等處遂屢有必須補種、農事延緩之說、有若干方面稱棉産入六月後、較諸往年棉季遲四五天、大西洋諸州密西西比州及台克薩斯州西南果蠧蟲現、漸發現但現尙不多耳、本地經紀人之代表棉業合作社者、共收進五月期紐約四十九萬二千包、紐鄂倫斯八萬四千包、投機之風不熾市價跌時、稍有人購進、蓋預料夏間將有棉産恐慌也、</p>
<p>又訉棉花市現在破天荒之交割後、滯鈍而無精彩、現棉需求薄弱、國内紡業狀况甚爲不佳、繼續减産、棉作進行尙好、氣候較前爲佳、</p>

<p>滬南　前昨兩市均極堅挺、河下到貨十餘號、各檔去路不一、常錫機粳因鄉莊問津、故大多喊起、旦有少數客帮採購、價格乃見昂角外、此間特别頂粳須二十无關左、蘇同機粳零銷亦不寂寞且屬端午節後、各店例須添辦、故大盤亦告上升一角左右、南帮薄早稻到源本屬有限、積貨亦告凋零、行情故極堅穏、緣走銷祗少數、羊杜各尖存到依然稀少、兼洋米影響、大爲沉靜、市乃仍鮮榮辱、變元陰化續見不振、價格逐步下降、全日各市除秈元呆靜外、餘均緊俏活潑耳、</p>
<h3>洋米晨漲午跌</h3>
<p>進出二角</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、開市後人心甚佳、因仰光罷工、來貨减少、貨主一致看好堅擯、晨間有漢口帮及内地等客暢辦、價仍激漲二角、午後各帮嫌大停辦、貨主因價已扳足、且虞仰光罷工風潮平後、來貨湧到、乃趁機求售、價乃立小二角、結果仍與前日相似、祇留一度暴漲之市價痕跡耳、共計開出一萬五千包、小絞半數、計一號西貢十六元兩角至十六元、又二號十五元五角半、小絞十五元七角二分至十五元四角、大絞十五元四角左右、敏黨十五元七角二分至十五元半、又一禮拜交貨十五元五六角、安南更十七元三角、小絞糙十四元二三角云、</p>

<p>黄荳　昨市靑雲直上、大連産電固然告佳、而金市之影響亦屬主因、查邇來到源因連申兩地市價不划、極不暢旺幸本埠底貨尙可、故在節前呈呆穏之局、詎昨市形勢大變現豆客帮忽突暢辦、標準囤戶亦殷、但賣戶鑒情形之轉變乃觀望而扳售、於是平格元豆竟飛漲一錢之鉅、高開五兩六錢、標準六月期五兩六錢八分亦狂漲九分之多、市勢大秀長江豆到稀銷爽、亦見跟蹤而上、成交五千餘包刻下本街車坊小磨客帮進胃均極活動、</p>

<h3>南國社舉行第三期公演</h3>
<p>南國社自去年七月由話劇股舉行第二期公演以後、一年以來文學美術方面努力較多、現值劇運風雲高張之秋、聞該社話劇股亦願以月來所積極準備者公之於世、該社本期公演共分作三次舉行第一次公演劇本爲田漢氏改作法國梅禮美氏的「卡門」（Ca　men）、由兪珊女士主演、共六幕、十一塲、爲南國所演最初之長劇、梅禮美小說、雖作於距今百年前、但由此劇可以聽取今日西班牙民衆之聲、第二次主要劇本爲柯倫泰夫人的「赤戀」、及田氏所作年夜飯審判等劇、第三次爲田氏創作羣衆劇「水道·」及收回當等、第一次公演已定於本月十一日至十三日間、先在中央大戲院作三日的公演、至於第二次第三次連續舉行、以期不副社會人士一年來之厚望云、</p>
<h3>幾日間的戲劇生活彭成慧</h3>
<p>我是生來好動的、無論什麽事情、只要我高興的·樂意的·我都盡情地去幹、因此不論在家鄉或在外面、都有許多人說我是「不知天」、「孩子性」、但、說只管渠們說、而我却没有一些所謂依然順着我底熱烈的個性狂奔、</p>
<p>這次上海戲劇協社在中央大會堂公演沙士比亞傑作「威尼斯的商人」、我爲了師友們熱烈的相邀、和自己好動情緒的燃燒、便高興地欣然參加、因此在熱閙的幾十個演員中、我竟在其中佔了一個位置了、</p>
<p>我雖然不是扮演什麽重要的角色、但對於幾日間的戲劇生活、我却是一樣地享受到、這些生活我覺得眞有趣、絶對不是日常所能感受得到的、雖然時期很短、但在我單調的、刻板的日常生活中、却覺得特别的有意義、特别的有興趣、特别的有生氣、現在我就把我所感受得到的、一槪寫在下面、</p>
<p>一團和氣　戲劇協社的合作精神、眞使我驚異、在五十多個演員當中、雖然各界都有、但個個都很合作、很努力、很盡責、絲毫没有互相推辭的表現、并且個個的性情、都很温柔、很和藹、一點没有驕矜的氣槪、我是一個新進的、但經了一番紹介和談話以後、便覺得個個都是滿面春風、個個都很可親、個個都猶如老友一、般因此我一點都没有侷促的不安、我一點都覺不到他們是新交、我們任情的談話、我們任情的歡笑、的確、我覺得在裏面、眞是一團和氣了、</p>
<p>大地當棹　爲了那個地方太狹窄、所以在那邊、對於食飯方面、便没有像我們學校裏的一張張的、齊整的、莊嚴的食檯、在食飯的時候、我們便不得不將大地當檯了、但雖然如此、我們却絲毫覺不到有不自在的地方、反而覺得非常的有意思、非常快樂、我們食的是炒飯、每當飯店的夥計將飯送來時便一碗一碗的擺在地下我們便互相含笑着蹲下去端起來、有的坐着吃、有的立着吃有的行着吃、有的蹲着吃、你不夠時我給你我不夠時你給我、直至各人痛痛快快地吃飽爲止、像這樣的吃法、我覺得實在比坐在什麽大酒店、大飯店裏、享着燈紅酒綠、吃着那高貴的珍品還要來得有趣、</p>
<p>上斷頭臺　這齣戲、其中有幾幕、有些論員是需要如鍋底般的畫臉面的、因此我們便稱這些演員爲鍋底面或Azrica、畫的時候是先用Cold　Cream塗上去、然後將各種顔色畫上去、但這極畫法、要使面孔發生一種怪難受的奇癢、手又不敢去抓把、因爲一抓把、顔色便要被抹去了、所以每次輪到我要畫這種面的時候、我都懶洋洋地不大爽然去接受、因此我便呼這種畫面爲上斷頭臺、而擔任同我畫的人、亦就以上斷頭臺呼我、「喂上斷頭臺啊、」每次一聽到這個命令時、便知道要畫鍋底臉面了、</p>
<p>爭做貴族　我們有幾個爲了怕上斷頭臺的緣故、所以時時刻刻都想乘機換換角色、有一次做貴做的演員、有一個因事没有到、我們幾個怕上斷頭臺的同志、便笑着互相爭着要做（同幕）「喂、給我做啦、」一個笑着說、</p>
<p>「你的面一點都不像貴族呢、」一個笑着答、</p>
<p>後來弄來弄去、却給我做了、有的說我一點不像貴族、有的却說我像極了、我都不管、我只管穿起了貴族的、服戴上了貴族的帽子寫寫意到審判堂裏去了、</p>
<p>導演跳舞　自然這齣戲的本身、便是一本轟動全世界的千古不滅的名著、而此次表演的諸位演員、亦的確能夠將牠的偉大、全盤表現出來、悲哀處可以使人落淚、滑稽處可以使人大笑、憤怒時可以使人咬牙切齒清幽、時可以使人如坐深山幽谷、全齣的表情、實可以使觀衆的感覺千變萬化、忘記是置身於戲院之中、這并不是我故意吹毛求疵、事實確是如此、觀過的人、便知道我的話不錯、在五幕中、差不多每幕裏、都可以聽見觀衆們如雷般的鼓掌聲、我們的導演應雲衛先生（他是怎樣的一個人、記得幾天前已有吳楨先生在本欄裏介紹過了、用不着我再來多嘴了、）每每聽見觀客們熱烈地唱彩時、便忍不住手舞足跳起來、在他那種高興的情緒底下、他便更加努力指揮着演員、鼓勵着演員、而演員們亦就更加生動、更加落力了、啊、他眞是一個偉大的藝術擁護者、他眞是使我欽佩的一個人、</p>
<p>互鬧笑話　在這齣戲中、有許多地方、可以使人捧腹笑的、我覺得最好笑的、還是當Morocce（面最醜）向Portia求婚時的一段笨話、什麽不要討厭我皮膚的顔色、這是遮蔽光明的太陽的外衣什麽我這把刀殺死過波斯的國王和王子、三次打敗過蘇力曼大王什麽講家庭、講才貌、講門庭我都配得上、什麽呀、倒霉、一個骷髏我每次一聽到他這些話時、便忍不住要笑了起來、其餘的演員、都有同樣的感覺、因此我們一在後臺閒着時、便是你一句我一句他一句的鬧着這些笑話、到現在時過境遷、我們若逢到同志們、一將這些話吟起來時、還是忍不着大笑起來、五·二十八日於曁大</p>

<h3>兩位女作家汪倜然</h3>
<h3>女陪審員</h3>
<p>張問鵑女士著</p>
<p>光華書局出版</p>
<p>我們「發現」了兩位女作家</p>
<p>一位底處女作是小說集、一位底處发　是詩集、雖然都是薄薄的小本子、但却都是能使讀者感到像發現美妙的新境地般的喜悅的、這兩冊小本子固然並不能使人十分滿意、但處女作有了這樣的成績已是很不容易的了、</p>
<p>我們先說那本短篇小說集、「女陪審員」對於這本小說集、我們簡直只有贊美、尤其是要贊美這位女作家和其他女作家不同的地方、這不同的地方是在於寫小說底手法上我們都知道寫小說的女作家已經很有幾個了、但是她們的作品完全是同一個面目的都是以所謂「細膩的心理描寫」見長、而所謂「細膩的心理描寫」者又大都是這幾位小姐們在「雅興勃發」之際信手寫來的本人在本種時期的心理、因此寫得不但不厭其詳、而且頗有難捨難分之槪、所以不必寫出來的心理也寫了進去、可以寫得簡潔點的也喜歡說得仔細些、因此女作家們底作品大多不經濟、而且心理描寫越細膩的就越不經濟、於是故事沉悶而篇幅冗長、其結果、除了細膩而外無其他長處、除了心理而外無其他内容、自然這也是天地間的自然現象之一、因爲女性底說話總不大經濟些、並且對於本身底生活總較爲注意些、所以竟似乎除了大寫其自己、大寫其心理之外、没有别的辦法、但小說倒底是小說好比一個人胖點瘦點倒不要緊、但總得有皮有肉有骨頭、假如我們把一篇小說寫得細膩到亂七八糟、眉眼不清、那就好像一個人祗有三根骨頭、混身都堆滿了肉、不但癱倒了站不起來、簡直是半分像人、九分半像鬼怪了、所以那樣的小說實在都是發育不完全的畸形兒雖然可以算在小說之中但决不能算作完美的小說、更不值得拿它捧起來抬在肩膀上、到處去賽會游行、然而在事實上是、女作家們雖則老是愛産生一些畸形兒的作品、但在有嗜痂之癖的先生們看來却都是天仙美女、空前傑作當然、我們並不敢說女作家們産生不出好作品來、天地良心那是我們萬萬不敢的、但、我們覺得、假如她們肯慢慢的産生她們的作品、在創作之際、多加斟酌、多加剪裁同時對於旁人底生活多加一點注意、我們相信她們必定會寫出更好的作品來、可是、似乎大多不耐煩這樣做、所以我們始終只有看看那種結構鬆弛叙述冗沓的小說的福氣、</p>
<p>這原是咱們「中國作家」底老脾氣、寫短篇小說一定要寫得像一部長篇小說、决不肯寫得像一篇短篇小說寫長篇小說呢、又一定要寫得像幾篇短篇小說、决不肯寫得像一部長篇小說、這種辦法雖似不妥、但却巧妙非常、因爲唯其如此、才能旣像這又像那、於是只要寫一篇東西、就可以又像長篇小說又像短篇小說、又像詩（所謂「某人底小說簡直像一篇「詩」是也）可像論、文又像傳單、這樣、當然是面面俱到可以應付一切了、</p>
<p>但、也因爲寫這像這、寫那像那的東西少、所以這樣的東西特别地可貴了、短篇小說也就是如此、正因爲像短篇小說的小說少、所以我們看見「女陪審員」裏的幾篇短篇小說時、特别地感到喜悅、的確、這個小說集底最大特色就是、他給我們的確實是短篇小說、而我們要贊美作者的也在於此、就是、她肯寫而且能寫「眞正」的短篇小說、</p>
<p>所謂「眞正的短篇小說」者、就是那適合短篇小說底規律的作品、這樣的作品必定是具有經濟、緊密、有力諸要件的、在這里我們並不想討論短篇底界說、但我們可以說、如果一篇短短的小說能夠告訴我們一件單一的故事、使我們得到種明確的印象、並且看完之後、對於其中的人物環境情節等等都覺得滿意的、那這篇作品就無疑地是一篇好的短篇小說了、「女陪審員」裏的幾個短篇、大多適合這種條件所以頗能使人滿意、這七個短篇都是以女性做中心的、故事底主人公都是女子、因此所寫的當然都是女子底生活和心理了、但寫生活之處比寫心理之處要多許多、可是我們仍然很明確地看到那些女主人公心理、這就是因爲作者知道用生活和動作來表現心理的緣故、這是很巧妙、很有力的手法、也是寫短篇小說所必須採用的手法、可惜我們的女作家們大多不知道這個方法、只曉得嘮嘮叨叨的「細膩」地「描寫心理」、據作者底「自序」說、她是要「拿起這枝秃筆來把女同胞們受苦的情形、約略寫了幾段」祇求發出我胸頭的悶氣就夠了、」因此在書中我們很容易看到這種女性底反抗的呼聲、尤其是在「女陪審員」「學監馬老太」「女丐」等篇、而「女陪審員」中的反抗情調尤其是直接而且濃厚、但這三篇寫女主人公底性格都寫得很好、她們的故事也都能挑動讀者底同情、所以我們覺得這三篇是全書之中之最好的、女陪審員因爲不服法庭把一個到監獄探望丈夫的女人定了死罪的判决、而竭力奔走、要救出這個女人、她那憤激熱烈、堅毅嚴肅的性格、被價者用了一些短峭的辭句、簡單的事實活躍地寫了出來、是很能打動讀者底心的、「馬老太」一篇純從客觀來寫這古怪的女主人公、寫她的容貌、她的行逕、她的性格、她的歷史、都寫得深切明確使讀者得到深深的印象、而且自始至終抓住讀者注意、在技術上、這篇小說是很可贊美的、主人公底思想確是舊些、但她仍然是一個很使人感動的人物、有一段描寫說、</p>
<p>她走起路來、挺着胸脯、仰着頭、氣槪昻然、好像一個戰塲的壯士、假使是遮去兩隻小脚的話、</p>
<p>我去時、她正在理書、她處置這書本、像處置砲彈一樣、（六十四頁）</p>
<p>這短短的兩句話就很可以看出作者底描寫手腕底靈活和觀察力底敏銳了、此外、「女丐」寫思想簡陋的鄉間女子底</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>愚蠢和可憐「絮　因女士」寫有智識女子底犧牲精神、「血書」寫男性底痴情和女性底刻薄、都一方面能引起讀者底興味、一方面能表現各種型式之女性底個性和生活、而頗有直摯的情調的、只有「一個樵柴的女子」底主人公、一個因戀愛和革命的幻滅而逃入深山過原始生活的現代女性、頗像是小說的事實、而被寫成使人難信的事實、是較差的一篇、</p>
<p>看完這篇以後、我們覺得作者似乎是很受外國小說底影響、所以這幾篇底結構雖是很自然很寫實的、却很有點像外國小說、其中的描寫也頗顯露外國文學底影響、但從技術上看來、這種現象是可以贊美的、我們介紹外國文學、不就是因爲外國文學能影響我們的文學創作底品質和技術麽、所以、像「女陪審員」這樣的作品、愈産生得多愈好、</p>
<h3>湖風</h3>
<p>虞琰女士著</p>
<p>現代書局出版</p>
<p>「湖風」則是詩集、在現在這詩風不振而女作家又多只愛寫小說的時代、突然出了這麽一本處女作的詩集、確是一件引人注意的事情、</p>
<p>這本九十頁的詩集、連小詩在内、一共含有四十多首詩、這些詩顯然都是少女底歌聲、其中雖也有苦悶、也有感觸、但這些苦悶與感觸也顯然都是「少女的」、温婉的情緒、幽柔的思想、清新的辭句、都是不但充分女性的、而且閃耀着少女時代底光芒的、詩人本善感、伹靑春詩人之所感、其情味到底還祇苦澀而未辛辣、「湖風」底作者亦不是例外、她的抑鬱苦悶的情懐固然很蓬勃、但其中似乎並無深切的悲哀、所以我們與其說這些詩是悲觀的哀呌、不如說它們是靑春期底現象、充滿玫瑰色幻夢的少男少女、初與冷酷現實接觸之後、往往因爲幻象底破滅而起了心理的反動、即抑鬱厭世的心情、但這樣的心情却是和那遍身瘡傷飽受打擊的戰敗之士底厭世心情是截然不同的、這不同、說得簡單點、就是失望和絶望之不同、沉浸在玫瑰色美夢之悶的少男少女、一旦醒來觸目只見汚黑的荆棘叢這時的驚憤和失望、當然是可想而知、但雖然失望、對於人間却是餘情未斷、尙含依戀、因此、這時候的厭世情懐和悲觀格調、雖頗灰色却並不陰森可怖、彷彿在晴朗的春日、黑雲雖突然漫蔽天空、但其間仍隠約有陽光透露、所以和黝黑的深夜終是不同、我們的女詩人在「湖風」裏所給我們的印象亦就彷彿如此、那些詩之所以充滿了暗澹的字句、憂鬱的情調、悲觀的色彩、而仍然不去温馨可愛的風度者、其原因就在於此、</p>
<p>女詩人底抑鬱苦悶顯然是很深沉的、所以是「觸景生悲」而「借物遣情」了、於是「春夜泛西湖」則月影歌聲都挑動了女詩人底哀思、想起湖上之遊時、更不勝感慨丨</p>
<p>一葉扁舟、</p>
<p>引起了無限離愁、</p>
<p>何時啊何時、</p>
<p>再得此遊、丨「寄湖邊的朋友」</p>
<p>在「小詩」中、我們更容易領略到詩人底敏感與悲懐、「階下小虫兒」她覺得是「哀鳴」、「泥絮中的落花」是「祇能追憶着春之温柔」、夕陽荒墓中的骷髏、她問它「你前身是美人不」、但有的如</p>
<p>綠草的閒愁、</p>
<p>薔薇的殘笑、</p>
<p>人生是這樣過去了、丨「小詩」二</p>
<p>飄風吹着的雲、</p>
<p>它正像人們的心、</p>
<p>搖動着不定、丨「雜感」十</p>
<p>却是頗具幽思的可愛小詩了、說到小詩、我們覺得最可惜的是、女詩人所寫的小詩太少而「大」詩太多、所謂「大」詩者就是那些較長的詩、如「沉醉」「一隻破船」「贈SS女士」之類、因爲我們覺得詩人是長於寫短詩而拙於寫長詩的、這可以拿長詩來證明、有許多長詩往往只有一小部份的行數眞有詩味、例如、第一首祇有「那悠柔起落的打漿聲、劃碎了湖中的月影、衝破了人生的寂寥」、三行眞是詩、第六首「夜底呻吟」、祇有前二節才詩味濃郁、「和風吹着底月夜」最後一節好、「羨慕」也是最後一節好「雨夜」是只要第一節就夠了、後兩節舊詩痕迹太深、像這樣的例子很多、所以有幾首詩、如「夜的呻吟」、「病中」、「失去了心之夜」、以及寫景的「夏夜」「晨曦初上的海邊」等、雖是全篇都可愛、但有幾首却只有内中的幾行好、我們覺得、假如作者把這幾首詩用用「緊縮政策」、寫成十行以下的短詩、豈不是好、又有幾百首的舊詩氣味太厚、「團　」「悵望」「關山」「清輝」「瀟瀟」「颯颯」「驪歌」等字眼用得太多、未免有點陳腐吧、</p>

<h3>Yang's Army Occupies Ye County</h3>
<p>Xiangcheng Can Be Captured Within Days of Siege</p>
<p>All Forts in Xu and South Henan Have Been Occupied</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luhe, 2nd - (1) Two regiments of enemy troops that invaded Lin Ying and Yingqiao from Jia County were met with a severe attack by Zhang's brigade of the Central Army's Xu Yuanquan's division and have retreated to Guzhai to defend to the death.

(2) On the 1st, Xu's troops had already circled around to the west of Xuchang, with the vanguard only ten li or so from Xuchang city.

<h3>Situation in Northern Shandong Eases</h3>
<p>Jin Army Retreats from North of Yucheng</p>
<p>(Jinan) There are no Jin troops within forty li north of Yucheng, and the situation on the Jinpu Railway line has eased. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

(3) The enemy in Xiayi is also retreating towards Linyi. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Battle Situation on the Longhai Railway Line</h3>
<p>Fighting Eases Somewhat From the 1st</p>
<p>Rumors of Jiang's Injury are Pure Fabrication</p>
<p>Lu Zhonglin Goes to Lanfeng to Supervise the Battle</p>
<p>(Nanjing) From the morning of the 30th, the Central Army launched a second general offensive against the Northern Army's positions on the Longhai Railway line. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, both sides stopped attacking from the 1st. (2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fan Songfu, brigade commander of the Sixth Division, telegraphed Nanjing from Qixian on the 1st, stating that in the morning of the 1st, Ji Hongchang again led his defeated remnants in a fierce counterattack, charging seven or eight times, but were all repelled by our defending soldiers, with countless enemies killed and many captured. After this attack by our brigade, there are very few Ji's rebels left, and they have no ability to counterattack. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Lizi telegraphed Li Zhonggong from the front on the 1st, saying, "The Commander-in-Chief is very safe and healthy, and there is absolutely no injury. It is all propaganda fabricated by foreign reports and the rebels. Please be responsible for dispelling the rumors. Recently, due to the enemy's reinforcements resisting and counterattacking stubbornly, the intensity of the fighting is unprecedented. More than half of the main force of the rebels has now been destroyed. Although it is not possible to reach the destination within the scheduled time, the rebel army is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. All the troops have been completely mobilized for a final struggle. Final victory will surely belong to us. Please rest assured." (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zheng reported that the fighting has been fierce for the past three days. Lu Zhonglin went to Lanfeng to supervise the battle, and Feng stationed in Kaifeng. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Headquarters announced military news: After the combined forces of Yan and Feng repeatedly collapsed and were defeated, they launched stubborn counterattacks on the 24th and 26th, suffering extremely heavy losses after repeated falls and resistance. Their reserve teams in Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Bian (Kaifeng) have all been added to the rescue effort. However, the entire line has been broken through by our army over time, with hundreds of holes and thousands of sores. Patching the east to repair the west only strains things further. After the 30th, heavy rain poured down, forcing them into a desperate struggle. Pseudo-generals Ji Hongchang, Pang Bingxun, Sun Liangcheng, Yang Yaofang, Yang Xiao'ou, and others led their troops, exerting all their strength, personally supervising the battle, braving the rain and advancing directly and fiercely. The momentum was extremely fierce. Our army, familiar with their tactics, waited calmly. When their troops approached our positions, they suddenly launched a unified and fierce attack, with machine guns and bombs sweeping and bombarding. The enemy advanced and retreated in a dilemma, and were killed in close combat. Blood and flesh flew everywhere. In front of our positions, corpses were scattered everywhere and blood and flesh covered the ground. From last night until noon today, the invading rebel troops have also been annihilated without remainder. Very few escaped. An inspection of the corpses showed that there were more than 13,000, including about one hundred and dozens of upper and middle-level officers, making it the biggest and most disastrous defeat for the rebel enemy since the start of the war. Now their remaining troops are fleeing westward in a state of utter disarray, and their combat capability has been completely lost. It is thought that they will not dare to attempt anything again after this setback. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of World Commerce</h3>
<p>The decline of world commerce is primarily due to the increasing sophistication of machinery, leading to overproduction and excess supply. Secondly, it is caused by the exhaustion of world finance and the widespread reduction of purchasing power after the European War. Thirdly, it is due to the awakening of workers who are demanding better treatment, which increases the cost of goods. All of these are natural trends and are unavoidable. As for today, there are even more causes. One is that the colonies of various countries were originally their sole sales markets. However, due to the failure to obtain freedom, disturbances continue, further hindering the sale of goods and making commerce even more difficult. The second is that the countries that use silver in the world, although not many, are all places for selling goods rather than producing them. Now, gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and the price difference is increasing daily. The value of goods has doubled compared to the past. As a result, commerce is not only declining but also causing disturbances. Due to these two factors, even the strongest and richest commercial countries, with quick and far-sighted intelligence, are unable to save the decline of today's commerce and return it to prosperity for the time being.</p>
<p>In short, the misfortune of today's commerce is not caused by just one aspect of commerce itself, but by various environmental factors. Therefore, if the environment cannot be changed for the time being, then the misfortune of commerce cannot be saved for the time being. Moreover, even if this environment were to change, the principle of increasingly sophisticated machinery, faster and greater production of goods remains unchanged. Therefore, although commerce in one place at one time may have a better period, its ultimate end is still inevitable.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Liu Ruiheng's Talk</h3>
<p>Going to Xuzhou to Inspect Hospital Conditions</p>
<p>Location of Rear General Hospital Undecided</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Health Liu Ruiheng recently went to the Xuzhou and Guide areas to inspect the conditions of wounded soldiers and has completed the task. He returned to Nanjing at 2:00 AM on the morning of the 1st. A reporter from this newspaper visited Liu at the Ministry of Health on the 2nd to inquire about the situation at the front and the tasks of this trip to Xuzhou. Liu answered each question in detail. The questions and answers are recorded as follows: (Reporter) What was the purpose of your trip to Xuzhou? (Liu) My trip to Xuzhou was to inspect the conditions of the hospitals and had no special purpose. As for the organization of military hospitals, it is the responsibility of the Military Medical Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Health Department of the Military Station Headquarters, not the responsibility of this ministry. My trip to Xuzhou was only for inspection. (Question) How many wounded soldiers are being received at the front? (Answer) The Xuzhou area was originally scheduled to receive two to three thousand people. However, due to the Lanfeng campaign, there were more casualties. The Xuzhou hospital could no longer accommodate them, so the slightly wounded were transferred to the rear. At the same time, because there were fewer doctors in Xuzhou, the ten or so doctors who accompanied me on the trip to Xuzhou remained in Xuzhou to assist in the diagnosis and treatment. (Question) I heard that a general hospital will be established in the rear. How is the progress in recent days? (Answer) It was initially planned to establish a rear general hospital at Moling Pass outside the city. However, after sending a special commissioner to inspect, it was found that all the barracks there were already in use. It is now being prepared to look for suitable locations in the Suzhou, Changzhou, and Hangzhou areas for accommodation. Director Jin Fupan of this ministry has already scheduled to go to Hangzhou in the next few days to investigate. (Question) Is the rumor that Chairman Chiang was injured true? (Answer) Foreign reports said that the Chairman was injured and also said that my trip to Xuzhou was to examine the Chairman. These rumors are groundless. I met with Chairman Chiang, and he was in excellent spirits and even more robust than before his departure. It can be seen that what is reported in the foreign newspapers is indeed a rumor. The authorities in Nanjing have now requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate and correct it immediately to avoid false rumors. (Question) How is the battle situation at the front? (Answer) The battle at the front is very smooth. When I met Chiang, he expressed great confidence and said that the remaining enemies could be completely eliminated in the short term.

<p>Obstacles Placed on Tracks</p>
<p>Suspected Attempt to Harm Tardieu</p>
<p>Reuters, Montereau, 1st -- Today, an express train from Paris to Marseille derailed en route, killing eight people and injuring fifteen. According to the railway bureau, the express train accident was caused by sabotage, with obstacles deliberately placed on the tracks. It is said that this was an attempt to harm French Prime Minister Tardieu, but this is not accurate, as Tardieu had already left for Dijon four hours earlier. Three British passengers were injured. An oncoming train was traveling at full speed but fortunately learned of the accident ahead in time. The driver quickly applied the brakes, and the train stopped, only a hundred yards from the accident site.</p>
<h3>US Exports to China Decrease</h3>
<p>Affected by Expensive Gold and Cheap Silver</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 1st -- As the price of silver continues to fall and the silver production surplus becomes increasingly severe, there is little hope of a price rebound in the short term. Therefore, American financial commentators have paid close attention to this. The value of U.S. exports to China in the first three months of this year has decreased by 25% compared to the same period last year, and the expensive gold and cheap silver is the main reason for this. According to statistics from the U.S. Senate Gold and Silver Investigation Committee, last year's world silver production reached 262 million ounces, which is 5 million ounces more than the more accurate commercial statistics believed to be true.</p>

<h3>British Conservative Party Promotes Policies</h3>
<p>Advocates Implementing Protective Tariffs</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st -- Conservative Party leader Baldwin stated in a speech in Leeds yesterday that when the future Conservative Party regains power and proposes levying taxes on foreign food to give preferential treatment to imperial food, a national plebiscite will be held. Only in this way can public opinion be accurately known, and the government can act according to public opinion, so that later governments will not deem it necessary to abolish existing economic contracts. Baldwin also said that those who implement the McKenna protective tariffs are entrusted by the people and have the support of the majority of Parliament. The Conservative Party did not expect that today's minority Labor government would want to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Issue of Supreme Command</p>
<h3>Atmosphere in the Japanese Military Still Ominous</h3>
<p>Electrics Communication, Tokyo, 2nd -- Although yesterday was Sunday, Minister of the Navy Zaibu summoned senior naval officials to his official residence at 12:30 PM to exchange important opinions. Although the content of the meeting was not made public, veteran generals with combat experience, while not directly dissenting from the contents of the London Naval Treaty, raised rather severe questions about the Minister of the Navy's report on the details of the decision on supreme command and military strength. Furthermore, after the meeting, at 6:30 PM, the Minister of the Navy summoned Lieutenant General Sakonji, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau Kori, and others to discuss future countermeasures for over an hour. The atmosphere in the military does not seem easy to ease.</p>
<p>Another Telegram: The government views the decision of the military council and official meetings regarding supreme command as a problem within the Navy Ministry, not a dispute between the government and the military. Moreover, the government is not bound by the decisions of the military council, so it holds an optimistic view. However, many in the Privy Council attach great importance to the future of this issue, as their interpretation is as follows: (1) The decision on military strength by the supreme organ of the navy, the military council, must have the consent of the Chief of the Naval General Staff to be definitive. The Minister of the Navy, who complies with this regulation, clearly holds a different view from Prime Minister Hamaguchi. (2) Director Kato, in light of the intentions of the military council, believes he is unworthy of his position and is determined to resign. (3) The above has a significant impact on the fate of the government. Although the Minister of the Navy has stated that even if Director Kato resigns, he himself will not resign, he cannot submit Director Kato's resignation alone due to his responsibility. The government fears that the problem will become serious and plans to postpone it until Full-Power Minister Wakatsuki returns home. However, what kind of waves the joint military council meeting of the Navy and Army will cause after Wakatsuki returns home will be enough to determine the fate of the government, so the government is paying great attention to this.</p>

<h3>Central Party Headquarters and National Government Weekly Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 2nd, the Central Party Headquarters held its 62nd weekly memorial service for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the auditorium. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Yu Jingtang, and others, as well as staff and guests from various departments, totaling approximately 500 people, attended. Chairman Dai Chuanxian presided over the ceremony. The chairman reported, stating that among the recent resolutions of the Central Committee, there were two of significant importance, which he specifically presented for the report to all comrades. (1) Every nation-building party has a central force. In a long history, it continues to be responsible for national political reforms and progress, creating the pillars of the country and consolidating the foundation of the country, so that politics does not go astray and the country can be long-lasting and stable. Otherwise, it is enough to cause chaos. The responsibilities of political parties in countries such as Britain and the United States are all like this. The Chinese Kuomintang has more than 40 years of revolutionary history and bears the sole responsibility of nation-building. The final success depends on the comrades of the party having an independent and unyielding spirit, intensifying their work, and firming their will. Therefore, it has been decided to first set an example from the Central Party Headquarters, concentrating its own strength. All comrades serving in the party headquarters will voluntarily contribute a portion of their income to help create a new construction with extreme glory and extreme value, to be completed within two years, to create the most magnificent new memorial for the party. Currently, during the period of political tutelage, the position of the party is to train the people and exercise political power. The so-called new construction is to infuse the party's nation-building plan and spirit into the general public, so that everyone understands the location of political responsibility and further enables the country, society, and nation to achieve great unity. When the constitutional period arrives, political power will be returned to the people, completing the nation-building strategy. This kind of preparatory work is extremely important. In this way, after the return of political power to the people, the party will have the eternal glory of not being replaced, and the people will still believe in its leadership and always display great effects. (2) All national commemorations must have significant meaning and permanent and universal characteristics, so that the people can concentrate their spirit and increase their patriotic movement. The Central Committee believes that it is necessary to re-regulate all kinds of memorial days that China currently has. It has now been decided to reduce or merge memorial days according to their history and nature and specifically designate them as national memorial days. The principles of these national memorial days are: one, those with permanent commemorative nature; two, those with universal commemorative nature; and three, those with important significance related to national independence. However, matters that have commemorative value for a part of the people and matters that can be jointly commemorated internationally, if they do not conflict with the party's ideology and are under the leadership of the party's policies, can also be freely commemorated without being prohibited. The above two matters are very important, so it is hoped that all comrades will pay attention to them. After the report was finished, the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Those present included Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Nanxian, Wei Daoming, Liu Ruiheng, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, Zhu Jingxi, Yi Peiji, Li Zhonggong, Chen Yi, Zhang Xiqian, Li Jinglun, Fan Guang, and others, as well as over 300 staff members from the National Government's civilian and military offices. Chairman Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony. Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report: "The military situation at the front is very smooth, but recently, foreign-language newspapers in Shanghai have published many unfounded rumors. It has been found that the origin of the rumors is either from the Tianjin-Beijing area or from fabrications. In the Tianjin-Beijing area, foreign mendicants such as Simpson have been bought off by Yan Xishan to do his propaganda, creating unfavorable news about the Central Government all day long, and foreign-language newspapers in Shanghai republish these news. Rumors that originate from fabrications, such as Minister Liu of the Ministry of Health going to the front to inspect hospital work, and foreign-language newspapers in Shanghai spreading rumors that Chairman Chiang was injured, are ridiculous and hateful. Now is a time of war, and such rumors can cause social unrest and shake people's hearts, so it is necessary to prohibit them. I hope that foreign-language newspapers in Shanghai will be particularly cautious when publishing news in the future, otherwise they will be punished. The Law on the Preservation of Antiquities was passed and promulgated at the State Council meeting last Friday. This law is of great importance to our country's culture, and I am specifically bringing it up today for discussion. Antiquities themselves can represent the national culture of the past and naturally have value for research. Researching the national culture of the past can help us promote the national spirit of the present and observe the national trends of the future. Its importance is self-evident. Some say that the national question in recent times is not a question of national bloodlines, but a question of national culture. This statement has insightful. However, to understand the national culture issues of the present, one must first study the national culture of the past. Especially in China, which has a history of four or five thousand years, we cannot suddenly leave the society of historical inheritance. Then, the national culture of the past should be fundamentally understood, and the preservation of antiquities representing the national culture of the past should not be neglected. In the past, our country paid too little attention to the preservation of antiquities. As a result, countless antiquities were destroyed, ruined, or transported to foreign countries. Even if some are still well-preserved, they are only used as antiques and toys, losing the true use and value of antiquities. I will now briefly talk about the most common six points. (1) The general public lacks common sense, and often very valuable antiquities are thought to have little value, and as a result, they are destroyed and ruined. For example, the Thousand Buddha Cliff of Qixia Mountain is decorated with cement, making it unbearably vulgar, what a pity. (2) Private collections of antiquities are either not well-preserved, resulting in a large number of damages, or</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Continuing Important News</p>
<p>they are well-preserved but not made public to the public, either as research materials or as commodities to be sold for a good price, resulting in them falling into the hands of foreigners. These are all bad phenomena. (3) Public institutions that collect antiquities lack responsible custodians, and as a result, very valuable items are stolen or replaced with counterfeit products. Sometimes, institution staff even embezzle, and the central and local governments do not pay attention, so batches of antiquities are smuggled into the market. (4) Some merchants have short-sighted eyes. They search everywhere, and through fraudulent means and low prices, they buy very valuable antiquities and then transport them to Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to sell to foreigners. Few Chinese are willing to spend large sums of money to buy antiquities, or they directly transport them to our country, where they can obtain huge profits, but the national loss is not small. (5) Some unscrupulous foreigners, under the pretext of evangelism or cultural investigation, travel in the interior of our country, paying attention to antiquities at all times, either buying them at huge prices or even stealing them privately. Many things are missing from the Dunhuang stone chambers in this way. (6) Foreigners rely on political power to seize antiquities by taking advantage of opportunities, such as when the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing. In addition to the countless antiquities that were destroyed and trampled, the number that were robbed was also considerable. Today, they are still displayed in famous foreign libraries and museums, which is heartbreaking to talk about. At this moment, we must think of ways to reverse the situation. For the first point, which is a matter of general public knowledge, it is not easy to remedy it in a short time. For the second point, we hope that all private collections of antiquities should improve their preservation methods and register with the local administrative authorities. We further hope that they will lend their antiquities to archaeologists, historians, and others for research, and the transfer of antiquities to foreigners will be absolutely prohibited. For the third point, if public institutions that preserve antiquities are negligent or fraudulent, the central and local administrative authorities should investigate the matter and impose severe penalties. For the fourth point, as long as the government enacts a law prohibiting the transfer of antiquities to foreigners, the danger can be reduced. For the fifth point, the central and local authorities should be responsible for paying attention to this at all times and in all places in the future. If it is discovered that foreigners are indeed engaged in illegal activities, negotiations should be initiated immediately. For the sixth point, our country is now striving to become stronger and should not be trampled by imperialists again. The governments of the countries that robbed antiquities during the last Eight-Nation Alliance invasion should return them all for the sake of promoting friendly relations. The above statements are all about the preservation of antiquities. When it comes to the excavation of antiquities, its nature is equally important. I believe that the academic institutions in charge of excavation should be clearly designated by the central government. The work of excavation, except in the frontier areas where it is very inconvenient for the central government to send people to excavate, should be undertaken by academic institutions directly under the central government. In this way, human and financial resources will be more economical, otherwise it will be both uneconomical and easy to cause conflicts. I will now give an example. The excavation of the Yin Ruins in Anyang, Henan, has been going on for 31 years since 1899. Because there has been no truly responsible organization for the excavation, there have been several unscientific collections, and the academic loss has been great. Since the year before last, the Academia Sinica has sent personnel to excavate, and progress has gradually been made, and works have been published. However, in the past year, local people have been causing trouble, and the work has been progressing very slowly, almost coming to a standstill, which is truly disheartening for academic researchers. When the central government formulates a complete plan for the excavation of antiquities, it should pay attention to this and ensure that the power of the excavation organization is unified to avoid obstacles."</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Establishment of the Ministry of Navy</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Li Shijia, Wang Shouting, and others all gave speeches. The Ministry of Navy of the National Government officially established on June 1st last year, yesterday (the 1st) was its first anniversary. At 9:00 AM that morning, all members of the ministry and officers from various ships of the fleet in Beijing gathered in the auditorium of the ministry to hold a commemorative ceremony. Flags and decorations were hung inside and outside the ministry, creating a magnificent spectacle. The officers and soldiers were neatly dressed and in high spirits. Deputy Minister Chen Shaokuan presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, Deputy Minister Chen delivered an opening speech, recalling the past and encouraging the future, with many sincere words that moved the entire audience. Next, Ministry member representative Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department, and fleet representative Wang Shouting, captain of the Hai Rong warship, also gave speeches successively. The following is a record of Deputy Minister Chen's speech:</p>
<p>"Today is the first anniversary of the establishment of our ministry. Everyone is able to celebrate here, and to celebrate on such a grand scale, everyone must be very happy. However, everyone also has a deep understanding of the meaning of celebration and happiness. At the same time, they should work harder in accordance with this understanding. We still remember that our Ministry of Navy was sacrificed under the iron hooves of the warlords. They intended to destroy us, changing the Ministry of Navy to the Naval Bureau, and then changing the Naval Bureau to the Naval Office, step by step to eliminate us. In the end, they simply wanted to eliminate the navy completely. The water stoppage agency would not allow us to exist, and even the officers in the ministry were driven out completely, not one remaining in Peiping. It was not until the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army that the soldiers of our army worked extremely hard to fight the warlords, counter-revolutionaries, and imperialists to the end. Therefore, the central government, observing all the internal and external situations, believed that it was necessary to quickly establish a Ministry of Navy. So, on this day last year, the government resolutely ordered the establishment of the Ministry of Navy. Now, a year has passed. We can say that we have today as a result of everyone's efforts. In other words, with everyone's efforts, we can establish the Ministry of Navy. If we do not work hard from today onwards, then the collapse of the Ministry of Navy will be inevitable. The reason why the Ministry of Navy in Peiping ultimately collapsed was, of course, because the warlords oppressed us, but half of it was also because the former Ministry of Navy stood under the corrupt government in Peiping and was surrounded by its atmosphere, inevitably染污their bad habits. First, there was the cause of self-destruction, so it was easy for this result to occur. Now, the question of whether this Ministry of Navy under the National Government can exist depends on everyone's efforts. Regarding the work of the past year, the ministry has already prepared a general report, which will be published soon. I will now give a brief report. Since the establishment of the ministry, a great deal of effort has been put into formulating regulations by the officers. Everyone, regardless of the cold or heat, day or night, has created all the regulations. All that should be promoted and reformed has been demarcated. Therefore, so much has been achieved in the past year. At the same time, in recent times, we have built several warships. The repairs and modifications are not included. The Yixian warship, which was recently planned, is now being rushed to be built and is scheduled to hold the launching ceremony on the anniversary of the Premier's birth in the second half of the year. This ship has 1,600 tons, much larger than the ones previously built. We were able to build this warship by relying on diligence, thrift, and savings. As for the artillery power of the warships in the army, we have also replenished it fully during these times, and without spending a lot of money. At the same time, we have devoted all our energy to training and education. The fleet held a large-scale exercise last year. Many warships have freed up time to participate in the exercise. Those warships that did not have time to participate in the exercise also practiced various tactics and exercises in their own defense positions. Regarding the training of soldiers, we have 500 soldiers in our training camp and 100 signal soldiers, totaling 600, who are all being trained urgently. The soldiers who were originally serving on the warships are being transferred out in batches to learn about guns, artillery, torpedoes, and electricity. A training class is set up for each subject to allow them to practice and train them to achieve success. As for the general officials, we always encourage everyone to seek knowledge. The previous time, eight officials and twelve students were sent to England to study naval affairs. This year, we plan to send several batches of students to England and Japan. We have improved the regulations and rules of the existing naval schools one by one, and conscientiously recruited students, recruiting 100 new students, who have now started classes. For the members of the ministry, regarding the work of the ministry itself, on the fleet side, since the establishment of the ministry, we have mobilized the fleet and worked hard on combat, bandit suppression, and local defense. Not only on the Yangtze River, but everywhere depends on the navy to protect their peace. The waters of Fujian, Zhejiang, and the vicinity of Guangdong have not been spared by our warships in suppressing the Communists and bandits. We are also working extremely hard to move forward. In addition to the Yixian warship, which I just mentioned, we also plan to quickly build the Minsheng and Minzu warships, so that they can join the Minquan and realize the Three Principles of the People. The Minsheng will be started this autumn. I have just briefly reported on our work. The achievements are all due to the consistent efforts of the officers and staff of all departments. In the past year, because Minister Yang concurrently served as the chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, and was also ill, he was unable to attend to the affairs of the ministry. I have been acting on his behalf. My talent is insufficient, so I only have this report today. I believe that if the minister is personally working in the ministry, then the work report and achievements in this year must be ten times more than this. From now on, I hope that our officers, staff, and all the soldiers of the army will work harder with one heart and one mind. Then, with our vigorous spirit, we will be afraid that we will have many more achievements every year. Here, I hope that everyone will continue to work hard based on love and sincerity, regardless of difficulties and hardships. This is the true color of our revolutionary navy. This is the ministry's fervent hope for the entire army, and it is also what I personally hope for our officers and soldiers."</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Business Firms Concurrently Operating Savings Accounts</h3>
<p>Order from the Executive Yuan to the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, and Finance, to Draft a Bill</p>
<p>Yesterday, regarding the matter of prohibiting business firms from concurrently operating savings accounts, the Executive Yuan issued an instruction to the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, and Finance, stating: "The National Government issued Instruction No. 1190, which included a letter from the Central Political Council stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had previously sent a letter, referring to a communication from the Ministry of Finance, regarding a report from the Shanghai Banking Association. The report stated that recently, various business firms in Shanghai have been engaging in savings operations as a way to attract business. The actual security of these savings is unknown, and these operations have not been approved by the government in advance. Should any negligence occur, it would greatly harm the livelihoods of ordinary people. They requested a decision on how to declare guarantees, restrict abuses, and generally oversee the savings business. The points raised were deemed to have merit. Besides communicating to the relevant departments, it was also specifically communicated to instruct the Finance and Construction Bureaus to thoroughly investigate and prohibit such activities in various counties and business associations, and to report back. However, the establishment of various savings associations originated with foreigners, and ordinary business firms have subsequently followed suit. The amount of capital they possess and how they operate is generally unknown. People who invest in these firms have no guarantee whatsoever. However, simply prohibiting them with empty words may not be effective. It was requested that the Economic Affairs Committee deliberate on a more thorough and far-reaching method and provide a prompt reply for compliance." This matter was submitted to the council. After being reviewed by the Economic Affairs Committee, it was stated that ordinary business firms engaging in savings business should be held accountable, and that the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce should be tasked with drafting a savings law and submitting it to the Legislative Yuan. It was further decided at the 226th meeting of the council to approve the review opinion, record the matter, and send the original letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government (in mimeographed form) to the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce to follow and implement, and to report back. A copy of the original letter was attached and duly acknowledged. The matter was then submitted to the 76th National Affairs Conference of this government, and it was resolved to comply. In addition to issuing a reply, the original attachments were urgently copied and issued to the relevant departments, instructing them to follow, and to communicate to the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce to follow, and to report back. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce were instructed to work together to draft a savings law and submit it for review."</p>
<h3>Lu Diping Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army</h3>
<p>Officially Assumes Office on June 1st</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang on May 30th reported that after Zhang Guitang's remnant forces fled into southern Hunan, they intended to cross from Guidong and Rucheng into Lianhua and Yongxin in western Jiangxi, advancing towards Pingxiang and the Jiangxi-Hubei border, with their destination being Jiujiang and Wuhan. However, the central government had already made arrangements to deal with these remnant forces. In addition to the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies pursuing them from northern Guangdong and the Fourth Route Army engaging them head-on in southern Hunan, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, in order to quickly resolve the situation and prevent these forces from becoming roving bandits, specially appointed Lu Diping, the former commander of the Second Army and the current chairman of Jiangxi Province, as the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Route Army. All troops stationed in Jiangxi were placed under his command. Lu officially received Chiang's appointment on the 29th and is actively organizing the headquarters of the Ninth Route Army. He is scheduled to issue a circular telegram on June 1st to formally assume office and immediately launch an attack on Zhang Guitang's remnant forces. Of the defenses in this province, northern Jiangxi is the most important because Jiujiang is the hub of the Yangtze River, connecting to Wuhu and Anqing downstream and reaching Wuhan upstream. Currently, troops are stationed here, and numerous warships are anchored in the river, making the defenses extremely solid. It is reported that Commander-in-Chief Lu, after completing preparations on all sides, will lead his troops to advance towards the Hunan-Hubei border, with the aim of joining forces with the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Route Armies to eliminate Zhang Guitang's remnant forces in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Deployment of Enemy Troops on the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>Zhang Fang Establishes a Provincial Government Office in Guide</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou reported that there have been continuous fierce battles between the two armies on the Longhai Line, but there have been no major changes in the lines. The Feng and Yan armies on the Longhai and Pinghan lines are trying to establish contact, extending from Lanfeng in the north to Xuchang in the south, passing through Chenliu, Qixian, Tongxu, Weishi, Yuchuan, Changge, and other places, forming a rounded defensive line. The Lanfeng-Luowang line is the most fortified, with the Jin army and the troops of Sun Liangcheng and Ji Hongchang stationed on this line. Song Zheyuan is on the Qixian line. In addition to attacking Lanfeng, the Central Army is also attacking the northeast of Lanfeng and crossing the river with a portion of its forces to cut off their rear.</p>
<p>Regarding the affairs of Henan Province, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek previously telegraphed Zhang Fang, inviting him to go west to prepare to go to Bian. He has now ordered Zhang to act as chairman of Henan Province and appointed Zhang Honglie, the former director of education of Henan Province, to assist Zhang Fang in establishing a provincial government office to manage political affairs. Currently, the two Zhangs have established a temporary office in the Second Middle School in Guide and have temporarily carved a wooden seal, waiting for the progress of the front lines before going to Bian to take over provincial affairs.

<h3>Details of Xu Zhuoran's Assassination</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen reported that Xu Zhuoran, who had a deep connection with the political situation in Fujian, was assassinated at 3:30 PM on the 28th in front of the Fengyi Money Exchange in Dashi Lane, Xiamen. He was shot five times and sent to the Xiusheng Hospital on Gulangyu for treatment. He died of his injuries at 5:30 AM on the 29th. This is a recent major incident in Fujian.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>During the political upheaval in Fujian Province, Xu happened to be in Guangdong. He then went to Beijing and Shanghai for an extended stay, returning to Xiamen only on May 2nd. In the past month, he frequently traveled between Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and Tongan, always traveling with only a light entourage. Plotters took advantage of this opportunity. On the 27th, Xu accepted an invitation from Xiao Shuxuan, the head of the Training Corps, and went from Xiamen to Tongan. At 5:00 PM, he visited Chen Yanxiang, a director of the Tongmei Bus Company, and then went with him to Jimei to visit Ye Yuan, a school board director of Jimei School. Commander Xiao had dispatched four guards to escort him. Xu spent the night at Jimei School. At 5:00 AM on the 28th, he went with Chen Yanxiang to Shuitou by car. At 11:00 AM, he returned to Tongan and spoke with Xiao Shuxuan. At 1:00 PM, he went with Chen to Jimei again, in response to Ye Yuan's invitation from the evening of the 27th. After arriving at Jimei, he received a name card left by Ye at the station, which read "Fengyi Money Exchange, Dashi Lane, Xiamen, telephone number..." This indicated that Ye had gone to Xiamen and was inviting Xu to meet him there. Xu went with Chen by ferry to Gaoqi and ordered the guards to return to the corps, taking only his servant Xu Mu. The three of them boarded a ship to Gaoqi and took a car to the Meirengong Station in Xiamen. Xu ordered his servant to take his luggage to the Nanhua Hotel first, while he and Chen took a rickshaw to the entrance of Hengsheng Street and alighted. Xu walked ahead, and Chen followed behind. Upon reaching Miaohou Street, Chen asked Xu if he knew the way to Fengyi in Dashi Lane. Xu said he didn't, so Chen walked ahead to guide him. Arriving at Fengyi, Chen entered first. Xu was still outside the door when gunshots suddenly rang out. Chen looked back and saw Xu staggering in, holding his chest and abdomen, exclaiming that he had been attacked by thugs. Chen hurriedly closed the iron gate and immediately reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau and Xu's family by telephone. Ye Yuan was also at Fengyi at the time. Soon, Huang Kun, the leader of the Public Security Bureau's detective team, rushed to the scene. Xu was still able to speak, saying that there were four assassins, three of whom were wearing black Xiangyunsha shirts and pants, and one wearing yellow Shuijie cloth clothes and pants. After speaking, he was in extreme pain and on the verge of fainting. Ye Yuan and Chen Yanxiang called for Dr. Chen Chunmu to treat him. Chen arrived, and Xu said that his injuries were severe and that he would not survive, so there was no use in trying. Soon, the director of the Tongshan Hospital also arrived to administer emergency treatment. At 5:00 PM, he was sent to the Xiusheng Hospital on Gulangyu. Lin Huanzhang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Wang Zongshi, the head of the Third Police Precinct, also went there. After discussions among the doctors, it was generally agreed that his condition was critical, but there was hope if they could operate to see if his intestines were injured. Dr. Xi, the director of the Hongning Hospital, Dr. Kinoshita, the director of the Xiusheng Hospital, and Dr. Xia Liwei (all Americans) performed the surgery from 7:30 PM to 8:45 PM. He had been shot five times. Two bullets severed his left finger and grazed his back, causing no harm. One bullet entered his back on the left side, penetrated his diaphragm, and exited one inch from the center, which was also not fatal. However, one bullet entered from the right, causing the meningeal blood vessels to rupture and bleed. The stomach wall was injured and bleeding, and the bullet pierced his left liver and left ribs, exiting one inch from the center, which was the most serious. After the surgery, his condition was not good. At 12:00 AM, his pulse was still stable, but around 3:00 AM, it changed drastically. The wound reopened and bled. At 5:10 AM, the wound was in extreme pain, and he tried to climb out of bed. His relatives and friends dissuaded him. Xu uttered a few intermittent words, saying, "Dying for the revolution, I am very willing to die, but there are many things that have not been finished, which is very regrettable." The last two sentences were spoken in a very low voice. A nurse comforted him, and Xu asked, "What is your surname?" She replied that it was Cai. Xu then said, "Mr. Cai, you don't know me, what am I still afraid of?" After only these few words, without mentioning his family or his affairs, he became silent and unable to speak. At 5:30 AM, he lost blood, trembled, and died.</p>
<p>When Xu was injured, his family believed that Ye Yuan had invited Xu to meet in Jimei, but then had already gone to Xiamen and invited him to meet at Fengyi. The assassins ambushed outside the Fengyi door, making him seem suspicious. The Public Security Bureau was requested to detain Ye Yuan for investigation. He was later released on bail pending further summons. Chen Yanxiang was also detained by the Gulangyu Public Works Bureau. On the 29th, he was extradited to the Siming Court. (30th)</p>
<h3>Riot and Jailbreak in Xiamen</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen reported that on the morning of the 25th of this month, dozens of rioters suddenly stormed the Siming County Prison, releasing 54 prisoners, killing one warden and one guard, and injuring Captain Hu and three soldiers of the garrison team. This is an unprecedented major case in Xiamen. According to eyewitnesses inside the prison, at 9:45 AM that morning, two men wearing long gowns came to the side gate of the prison, each carrying a foreign tin biscuit box, claiming to be visiting Zeng Wenbin. The gatekeeper let them in and turned to the iron gate. The warden, Lu Yongzhong, conducted a routine inspection, but the two men suddenly pulled out pistols from the tin boxes and shot at Lu. Lu ran back to the office hallway, where he was intercepted by a second group of rioters. He was shot once in each breast and died on the spot. When the first group of rioters entered the prison and started the attack, the second group of three men also just entered the side gate under the pretext of visiting Wan Yaonan, and they also responded with gunfire. At this point, the guards at the side gate were too frightened to move. The third and fourth groups of rioters continued to pour in, about ten or more people. The first group had already seized the keys to the No. 5 and No. 9 cell blocks, the prison workshop, and the women's prison. They opened the doors one after another and used two pairs of wire cutters they had brought to break the fetters of the prisoners. The second and third groups entered to assist, and they quickly finished, seized the prison, and rushed out. While the first, second, and third groups of rioters were infiltrating the prison, many people were also lying in ambush around the Siming Prison and the county government, some disguised as peddlers selling goods in front of the county gate, some dressed as students pretending to visit friends at the Education Bureau of the county government, and some pretending to bargain with peddlers in front of the county gate. When the attack inside the prison was launched and the gunshots suddenly rang out, the rioters outside acted in unison. Some selling bayberries immediately dumped the bayberries on the ground and pulled out guns from the basket, shooting at the guards at the county government gate. Guard Luo Yousheng was shot in the right arm and fell to the ground. At the same time, Pan Yongdi was shot in the left rib, and Chen Shihai, standing next to Pan, was shot in the right chest. All fell to the ground. At this point, the rioters rose up and fired their guns. All three guards at the gate were injured, and the county government gate was under the control of the rioters. Wu Guangcheng, the captain of the garrison team of the Siming County government, and Li Ruikai, a prison guard, heard the sound and came out to investigate, but were also attacked by the rioters who had rushed into the gate. Wu was seriously injured and fell to the ground, and Li died instantly. At this time, the rioters and prisoners inside the prison rushed out, merged with the rioters guarding outside, and escaped from the county government, scattering towards Dashizi, Xizaiwei, Qiaozaitou, and Nanyihe Street, leisurely escaping. After an investigation, of the 27 prisoners in the prison workshop, only two civil debtors did not escape. Among the remaining 25 escaped prisoners, 18 were suspected communists. Of the 140 or so prisoners in cell blocks No. 5 and No. 9, 18 escaped, including three suspected communists. Of the 18 prisoners in the women's prison, 11 escaped, including three suspected communists. In total, 54 prisoners escaped from the three locations, including 24 suspected communists. Later, court bailiffs and police arrested four suspected communists in the surrounding area: Cao Yousheng (male), Deng Sangu, Zeng Dagu, and Qiu Ergu (all female), as well as three other criminals. Two others voluntarily returned to prison. The whereabouts of the remaining 45 escaped prisoners are unknown. Afterwards, Deng Ji'an, the president of the Siming District Court, telegraphed the Fujian High Court in Fuzhou to report the prison break. The original telegram read: "To His Excellency Wang, President of the Fujian High Court in Fuzhou, This morning at 10:00 AM, dozens of communists suddenly broke into the Siming Prison from outside, armed with over a dozen Mauser pistols. They shot and killed one warden and one guard. The captain of the garrison team and three soldiers were seriously injured and are in critical condition. The military police were unable to provide timely assistance and were unable to resist. Fifty or sixty communist prisoners and other prisoners were seized and escaped. I heard the alarm and risked my life to go and supervise the defense. The remaining two hundred or so prisoners were prevented from escaping. Director Guo was fortunately away at the slaughterhouse to collect payments and was spared. In addition to reporting to the military and police agencies to strictly pursue the escaped prisoners and providing detailed information for a subsequent report, I respectfully report. [Signed] Deng Ji'an."</p>
<p>As for the direction in which the escaped prisoners fled, the court stated that according to the investigation, they boarded a motorboat from Yuhangkou and sailed far out to sea. According to reports, two motorboats were moored at Dashizi on the 24th night, and their traces have since disappeared, suggesting that they had prepared the motorboats in advance to escape. The Water Police Bureau stated that the bureau only had three patrol boats. Boat No. 1 was borrowed by the Salt Transport Office for anti-smuggling purposes, and Boat No. 3 was abolished due to insufficient funding. Only Boat No. 2, He'an, had just been repaired and left the dock. At 10:00 AM that morning, they received a call from the headquarters stating that the Siming County Prison had been broken into, ordering them to patrol the sea to intercept the prisoners. However, as soon as they set sail, the propellers broke down. They had to hire another boat and sail to Yuhangkou Dashizi to patrol, but by then the prisoners had already escaped, and there was nothing unusual on the sea. As for the court's claim about the motorboats at Dashizi on the 24th night, after investigation, it was not confirmed. Before the prison break, there was a blue motorboat at Yuhangkou, which then sailed back to Haihoutan. According to investigations, it belonged to Sanchun Store, and the boat could only carry ten people. The court's claim that the rioters escaped by motorboat has not been definitively proven. However, the Xiamen sea area is extremely vast, and the water police only have one patrol boat. Even if there were one or two motorboats, it would be difficult to investigate them in advance. The headquarters ordered a heightened state of alert that evening due to the escaped rioters, ordering theaters to stop performances at 11:00 PM, closing all transport at 12:00 AM, at sea and on land. On the morning of the 26th, the water police strictly inspected all small boats going to inland areas in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, but found nothing. The search is still underway. Meanwhile, the headquarters has dispatched a platoon of soldiers to be permanently stationed at the prison for defense. The injured Wu Guangcheng, the captain of the garrison team, and the three soldiers were immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Wu died of his injuries at 11:00 PM that night. The names of the escaped suspected communists are listed below: Li Tingsheng, Chen Junchang, Wan Yaonan, Xie Keshao, Zhou Wenliang, Chen Hualong, Zeng Wenbin, Wu Siwen, Zhang Hanzhong, Chen Jianquan, Zhang Gengtao, Xie Lingling, Xu Zhibao, Shi Tianyi, Lin Longsheng, Xie Yangtang, Weng Dehai, Zhang Binggui, Yang Qihui, Huang Lingang. Among them, Zhang Gengtao and Zhang Hanzhong are Xiamen University students who were arrested on March 18 for distributing reactionary leaflets in Zhongshan Park. Hanzhong was sentenced to one year in prison. (27th)</p>

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Property Division and Separation Case Reopened: Shen Xiuwu, a woman from this county, previously hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the county government, accusing her husband, Zhi Shangjiu, of abandonment and requesting a property division and separation. After a court hearing, the trial officer instructed both parties to invite the original introducers, Chen Qizhou and Yang Luchun, as well as relatives, to mediate properly.

<p>Bandit Attempted Robbery Failed: The family of Yao Gouqi, a villager in the Yangjiaqiao area of Qingpu, is known as a well-to-do family. Bandits had coveted them for a long time, but were unable to succeed due to strict precautions. On the night before last, at about 11:00 PM, over a dozen bandits suddenly came, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, their faces painted black, and armed with guns and knives. They broke down the door and entered. At that time, Yao Gouqi and his son, having heard the loud noise, knew that something was wrong and secretly slipped out the back. While the bandits were rummaging through boxes and cabinets, suddenly, shouts of "Catch the thieves!" rang out from nearby and continued to grow louder. The bandits knew that things were not good and dared not carry out their robbery. They abandoned their loot and fled eastward. After a careful inspection, there were no losses.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Minor Uproar at the Third Branch Prison Again: The Jiangsu Third Branch Prison on Siqian Street has experienced two prison riots in November of last year and March of this year. The ringleaders, including Jiang Yingcheng, have been sent to the Wuxian District Court for trial and sentenced to additional imprisonment. However, Jiang continued in his wickedness, refusing to repent. On the night before last, he suddenly started a fight on purpose. When a guard tried to stop him, Jiang refused to obey and put the chamber pot prepared in the cell over the guard's head. The guard, seeing that Jiang was beyond reason, took him out and handcuffed him. Jiang continued to curse endlessly. Later, Section Chief Yu of the prison reprimanded and stopped him.</p>
<p>Bandits Plunder Zhouzhuang: After the Taihu gang of bandits were repeatedly suppressed and defeated by the naval and land military police, they slightly disappeared.

<p>Attempted Suicide Due to Unsuccessful Debt Collection: Xie E, a 24-year-old resident of Taibo City, Daqiangmen in this county, currently residing at No. 11 Gaosi Lane, Suzhou, was previously an employee at Hengtaiyuan Silk Shop on Guanqian Street in Suzhou. Recently, as the end-of-May settlement period approached, Xie urged a friend to collect debts owed to him for transactions he had handled. Unexpectedly, the friend was raising funds to go to his hometown. Xie believed that the friend was making excuses to avoid paying the debts, and that he would inevitably be unable to collect them. In desperation, he conceived the idea of ​​ending his life. So, the afternoon before yesterday, he came to Wuxi from Suzhou and stayed in room 50 of Qitai Inn on Tongyun Road outside Guangfu Gate, claiming to be named Shi Dele, a homophone for "happy to die." That night, Xie wrote two suicide notes in advance, one to Wanxingchang Grocery Store outside the Suspension Bridge, and the other to Zou Qingyuan. One note was left with the inn's accounting department, stating that he had come to their establishment to make it his final resting place, and asked them not to request a court inspection, etc. Later, he went to the Sino-British Pharmacy outside the North Gate of this county, purchased a bottle of "Baoshui Kerona calming water," and returned to the inn, drinking it all. Around 10 a.m. yesterday morning, the inn's tea boy saw that Shi had not yet gotten up, and became suspicious. He knocked on the door, but there was no response. He peeked through the window and saw Shi lying stiffly on the bed, with a strange expression. He quickly broke the window and entered, finding an empty bottle of calming medicine and two letters on the table, realizing that he had taken poison. He immediately reported to the accounting department, who carried Shi to Tongren Hospital for treatment. At the same time, Shi's letter to Zou Qingyuan in Suzhou was sent by express mail. After Shi was sent to the hospital, the hospital's doctors tried their best to rescue him, and fortunately, he soon woke up, and his spirits gradually recovered. In the evening, Zou Qingyuan and Xie's cousin came to Wuxi to visit him at Tongren Hospital. Today (the 2nd), they will accompany Xie back to Suzhou for recuperation.</p>
<p>A Strange Tale of Triplets: Dong Wangqing, a resident of Yuelou Lane, Gedi Bridge, Kaihua Township in this county, has been working as a geomancer and his family is relatively well-off. His wife, Mrs. Mou, is nearly forty years old and has a ten-year-old daughter. Last year, Mrs. Mou became pregnant again, and her abdomen gradually expanded. Until around 7 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 1st), she felt labor pains and knew she was about to give birth. Dong Wangqing hired a midwife to come to his home to assist with the delivery. Soon, she gave birth to a boy. Unexpectedly, the abdominal pain continued, and successively gave birth to two girls. Dong's wife, Mrs. Mou, due to excessive childbirth, was unable to sustain her energy, and died of exhaustion at the time, but the three children were all well. After hearing the news, the villagers in the area went to see, and were amazed. Yesterday, Dong Wangqing had already prepared a coffin for his wife and buried her. At the same time, he hired a wet nurse to come to his home to breastfeed and raise the three children.</p>
<p>A Record of the Trial of a Boat with Four Lives: Xu Jianshan, a resident of Xu Lane, Nianjiushi Tu, Kaihua Township, Fourteenth District, hired a boat to transport goods on the 19th of last month from Renzi Port to Luzhu in Xishan, Dongting. The boat was robbed on Taihu Lake, and Xu Jianshan and the boatman Shao Qiaosheng and his son were killed. The boat has now been found by the Rescue Bureau, and the body of Shao Qiaosheng has also been recovered, all of which have been reported to the county government for verification. And the corpse brother Xu Mingqi, induced the suspect Wang Jie, reported the police to untie the county to take the confession. Yesterday, the hearing was held by the trial officer. According to Wang Jie's confession, he is from Lujiang, Anhui, and has served in the water police and the army. In the first month of this year, he came to Wuxi with his family and stayed in the upstairs room of the Gu family in Dalou Lane. The landlord, Mrs. Gu Yang, is my adoptive mother. A few days ago, he went to Nanfangquan to collect 80 yuan from a teahouse for Mrs. Gu. He went with Zhang Mengxi. 23 yuan has been received for this money. Regarding the case of Xu Jianshan and others being robbed, he firmly claimed that he did not know and recounted that he was in a certain place on a certain day, and that doctor Gu Zijing and young master Sun could testify. Yu Jun, according to the confession, ordered him to be remanded in custody, pending the summoning of Gu and Sun to the case for verification.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Utilizing the Yarn Factory to Temporarily Resume Work: The male and female workers of the Liyong Yarn Factory demanded an increase in rice subsidies. The county reorganization committee member, Zhong Jianhui, mediated and the workers proposed twelve conditions to be resolved. Because of the signing by the aide-de-camp Zhu Danqing on behalf of the manager Wang Yiyun, the next day, Wang expressed his opposition, saying that the conditions must be approved by the board of directors, resulting in the failure to start work. The workers marched and held meetings. It happened to be the May 30th Martial Law, and reactionary slogans were found at the same time. Li County Magistrate led the military police to conduct a major search. Because the representative Ren Ruisheng and others were suspected of committing crimes, they were detained, and will be released after the resumption of work. Yesterday (the 1st), Wu Yiyun and others met with Li County Magistrate. Li persuaded them to start work quickly to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. Wu Yu’er temporarily agreed to resume work on the 2nd. However, regarding the conditions, because the representatives were detained, they were suspected of being reactionary. Since they have been returned to the judiciary, they should be negotiated after a resolution is reached. After writing to the county party department, the party department rejected the reply, saying that there was no reason. Since the conditions had been signed by Zhu Danqing, they should be accepted immediately. Therefore, although Liyong was able to start work, the conditions regarding rice subsidies have not been resolved. Last night, the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Department was showing the film of the Prime Minister's burial on the Nanjin parade ground. Suddenly, a large number of red reactionary leaflets appeared, with absurd words such as helping the Liyong workers' strike. The on-site business group immediately searched, but did not find the person who issued the leaflets.</p>
<p>Famous Opera Singer Mr. Jiang Junjia Arrives in Cheng: The County Party Department and all sectors of society are raising funds to rebuild Zhongshan Park. They have specially invited the famous opera singer Jiang Junjia from Wujin and the Bin She opera troupe to come to Cheng for a performance. Mr. Jiang has agreed to sing for three days. However, Chen Daoan, the master of the Huqin, did not agree to come to Cheng, and was replaced by his son Xiaocun.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Being Abducted for Collecting Accounts for a Pawnshop: Dongfangjia Pawnshop in Xitang Beitang has been doing well in recent years. During this Dragon Boat Festival, there were many accounts in the surrounding villages. Therefore, they sent Xiao Fang, the manager, and Lu Gengshu, a partner, to collect them together. Unexpectedly, they have not returned. They have been searching everywhere, but there is no news of them. Recently, they received a message from the bandits, demanding 15,000 yuan before they would allow them to be redeemed. They are currently trying to rescue them.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Captured: The water police of the 7th team of Ganyao obtained confessions from previously captured bandits regarding their accomplices. They then arrested two bandits, surnamed Xu and Zhang, at their addresses. Their confessions were evasive. It is heard that these two bandits are respected figures in the local area. The remaining bandits are still being hunted.</p>
<p>Organizing a Reception Center for Wounded Soldiers: The county magistrate of this county received a telegram from the province, informing them that a large number of wounded soldiers, about a thousand, would be coming to Shan for recuperation. Therefore, at 1 p.m. on the 1st, he convened an emergency meeting of the heads of various agencies and local gentry. It was decided at the meeting that the county would allocate 5,000 yuan specifically for the provision of wounded soldiers, and a reception center would be established as a single authority. Xin'an Guild Hall and other places have been designated as residences for the wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>A Compilation of Robberies Occurring in the County: At the home of Lu Yongfa in Namingyang Village, Tanghui District, Jiaxing, more than a dozen robbers suddenly arrived around midnight the day before yesterday. Speaking in mixed accents and holding iron rulers and wooden sticks, they broke down the door and entered, overturning boxes and looting at will. They robbed nine shi of rice and one shi of rapeseed, along with clothes and ornaments, and tied up Lu Yongfa, beating him severely with weapons, causing him to be covered in injuries. The robbers then went to the home of Yu Sanfu next door to search and rob, taking clothes and stones of rice. Later, the robbers went to the homes of Wu Zhanglin and Wu Shenggao in Taoshazha Village, Wuqiao Village, and robbed them separately, with considerable losses. The next day, the victims reported to the local public security bureau for investigation. Also, the home of Ni Changsheng in Qianwei Village, Hantang District, was also visited by many robbers last night, who robbed at will. On the same day, Fang's family, a large family in Chenjiaqiao, was also broken into by robbers, who stole many ornaments.</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the 9th Far Eastern Games (4)</h3>
<h3>Japanese Referee Policy</h3>
<p>The Shamelessness and Unreasonableness of Referees</p>
<p>(From Qu, Tokyo)</p>
<p>The Japanese have dead effort but no living talent in sports. They are quite good at track and field events that require long-term training. However, they simply have natural deficiencies in basketball, volleyball, and football. At this Far Eastern Games, our country's volleyball strength far surpasses that of Japan. However, Japan came up with a fanciful idea to implement its "referee policy" to make up for its shortcomings. What is "referee policy?" This is a term unique to the Japanese. Please refer to the following facts for an explanation.</p>
<p>During the China-Japan basketball game, the Japan Sports Association invited an obscure elementary school physical education teacher from a remote county to be the referee. During the refereeing, he seemed to be instructed by others and temporarily formulated a novel basketball rule: whenever a Chinese team member dribbled the ball and came into contact with a Japanese team member, the Chinese team member would be penalized for a foul, with arbitrary penalties of one or two points. This went on for 40 minutes, and Japan "turned defeat into victory."</p>
<p>On the third day of the Far Eastern Games (the 26th), at 3 p.m., the China-Japan volleyball game was held. Japan thought that the "referee policy" in Hong Kong had been effective, so today they intensified their efforts. They invited a Mr. Yuan, named Liulang, to be the referee. He was about 50 years old, extremely crude, and based on his general knowledge, it seemed that he had not completed middle school. During the refereeing, he specialized in being shameless and unreasonable. When the Japanese team served, and our team counterattacked, every time the ball was touched, it was pointed out as touching the net (Touchnet) or as a held ball (Hoesie). When our team scored a point on a serve, it was pointed out as a foul and canceled. There were more prohibitions than hairs on an ox, but Japan never committed a single one. This happened dozens of times, and the audience was in an uproar. Even the slightly knowledgeable Japanese could not stand it. The reporter's neighbor was a Japanese news reporter group. Every time Yuan Liulang was shameless, they would scold him, saying, "This is too outrageous!" But Yuan Liulang remained stubborn and cunning. Our athletes repeatedly questioned him, but he was stiff and did not know how to answer. Fortunately, our country's volleyball coaches Zhao Shanwei and Liu Quanda persuaded them, saying that the competition was related to the honor of the country. Since he was being shameless and unreasonable, he was only tarnishing the reputation of his country. We should be patient and dignified. Mr. Brown, the West Secretary of the Tokyo Youth Association of Japan, was also present. He said to people, "Japan could have won this Games, and we deeply congratulate them. But with this referee, Japan's reputation has been swept away. This is why the American immigration law has a 'gentleman's agreement.'" This atmosphere of dissatisfaction with the referee has permeated the entire stadium. Later, a sensible Japanese gentleman took the opportunity to privately give Yuan Liulang a hint. Yuan Liulang was guilty of faking and knew that he was wrong, so his momentum was slightly restrained. In the second and third sets, our team won a great victory over Japan by 21 to 8. Japan's weakness can be proven by this. If it were not for Yuan Liulang's injustice, purely comparing skills, Japan would not have avoided a "zero defeat," because if it were as Yuan Liulang did, the victory or defeat of the competition would not be determined by the superiority of the athletes, but only by a referee. After the competition, the reporter asked Mr. Yanagida Toru, an official of the meeting for an inquiry into the origins and experiences of Yuan Liulang, asking "Where did Yuan Liulang come from?" Mr. Yanagida reluctantly and slowly replied, "He is not from Tokyo. You have already won, forget about it." The reporter said, "I admire Yuan Liulang very much as a person, because he is very patriotic." Mr. Yanagida smiled bitterly and did not answer. "Patriotism" must first "care about face," and "losing face" is "humiliating the country." Yuan Liulang is simply "losing face" and "humiliating the country." I pity Japan, I am ashamed for Japan.</p>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, with a flourishing talent pool and a more open atmosphere, but the referee for volleyball must be sought from Yuan Liulang, a remote village. The Japan Sports Association must have another intention. I cannot name it, I respectfully name it the "Japanese Referee Policy."</p>
<p>In the past, when one side was dissatisfied with the other side's referee, it always contained elements of misunderstanding and resentment. This article was written on the spot because I was very angry at the time, and there are many biased emotional words. It also seems to have a "non-gentlemanly" tendency. I have made some deletions later, but the ugliness of the Japanese referee policy has not been fully revealed, so I dare to take responsibility for the text.</p>
<h3>The First China-Philippines Women's Volleyball Match</h3>
<p>(Xu Minhui from Tokyo)</p>
<p>Result: China wins two to zero</p>
<p>China's spiking is very good</p>
<p>But they don't know the weaknesses of the attacker</p>
<p>The first women's volleyball exhibition match between China and the Philippines was held at 1 p.m. on the 24th at the Meiji Jingu Gaien Volleyball Court. In this match, China and the Philippines fought each other. As soon as the weapons were launched, the Chinese women's army was exceptionally brave. Captain Deng Zhihao's serves were fierce, and the Filipina generals only had the skill to parry, but no strength to return fire. The Chinese generals spiked hard, the forwards were smooth, and the coordination was quite skilled. Going smoothly, they immediately scored five to zero. Unfortunately, Deng was careless for a moment and made two mistakes, sending the ball to the other side. Fortunately, the generals bravely regained the serve, and Li Cuimei took over. Her serves were no less fierce than Deng's, so she also scored five straight, with the score being ten to zero. The ball was then taken away by the Filipina women. Not long after, it was taken back again. Lü served, and her momentum was not weak. After getting one point, they had to change sides. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy team stood up and fought hard, winning one point. After several fierce battles, they gained some victories. However, they had lost too much in the first half, and the general trend was gone, so the Chinese team won with a score of 21 to 8. After a minute of ceasefire, they continued with the</p>
<p>Second set: After winning the first set, the Chinese team became arrogant and scattered, and the formation was in chaos. The Philippine team took advantage of this, leading to a score of eight to four, and eleven to seven. The Philippine Islands had the upper hand. The team was panicked and did not know what to do. The score increased to thirteen to eight. The bystanders were worried about them. Fortunately, the captain was alert and announced a ceasefire. On the one hand, it could reduce the enemy's morale, and on the other hand, it could discuss tactics and change methods, and reorganize the team. So they regained their vitality. Situ Wei made the first extraordinary contribution, winning three points in a row. Xiao Huiling continued her efforts and scored five points in a row, taking the lead with sixteen to thirteen. The morale was even more invigorated. Overseas Chinese gave help and often shouted to cheer them on. Although the Philippine team resisted desperately, it was ultimately ineffective. The result was 21 to 17, and our team won.</p>
<p>In this match, our team's spiking was very good, and the setting was also quite appropriate. However, it was slightly inaccurate and did not know the weaknesses of the enemy. Moreover, the defense was slightly poor, and there were often improper serves, and there were often two failures, sending the ball to the other side. These are all the weaknesses of our team. In addition, they are contemptuous of the enemy when they win, and panicked when they lose. If they do not remove these weaknesses in the future when competing with us, the enemy's Japanese team, they may fail because of this. May you all be diligent! (Evening of May 24th)</p>

<h3>The Second Day of the Track and Field Competition</h3>
<p>Japan Wins the Championship with 131.5 Points</p>
<p>Our Country Gets Fourth in the Triple Jump, with Only One Point</p>
<p>The second day of the track and field competition was the day for the finals of each event (i.e., May 25). The audience was even more crowded than the first day. There was almost no room to stand in a large square. There were at least about 100,000 people. The competition started at 0:20 p.m. Our country only got the most precious one point in the final triple jump, with Mr. Situ Guang jumping fourth. This is better than the zero points in the first competition. However, the Japanese said that Nanbu Chuhei gave up the competition and let China get one point for the sake of appearances. The mockery can be said to be extreme. The second day of the competition is described below.</p>
<h3>(1) 100-Meter Final</h3>
<p>The 100-meter final has always been won by the Philippine army. This time, Japan's Yoshioka actually surpassed the Philippine army's Long Gong Shige and won the championship. This is truly a groundbreaking achievement for Japan. Gong Shige started the race too slowly. By the 50-meter mark, he had already overtaken Yoshioka. In the end, Yoshioka chased him down, about one meter apart. The result was 10.8 seconds. If our country's Liu Changchun had not injured his Achilles tendon, it would have been an easy matter to win first place. Third place went to Japan's Nambu, and fourth place went to the Philippines' Pinipa Heiersi.</p>

<h3>(5) Pole Vault Final</h3>

<h3>Lin Baohua Competing with Japan's Sato</h3>
<p>Pang, Otsubo Iwakichi, Mitsumura Kanji, and Kishigami Sakoemon had all overtaken Sun Anting, who retreated to fifth place, and Nuduo was sixth. The Philippine army's Dirake Kroos was seventh, and Ryuzawa Shin was ninth. Afterwards, Sun Anting and Nuduo chased each other, which was extremely fierce. Sometimes one was ahead, sometimes the other. It was quite a sight. The whole place applauded. By the twelfth lap, Nuduo had a stomach ache and left the field. The top four remained unchanged. At the finish line, the Japanese won the first, second, third, and fourth places. The Philippine army's Dirake Kroos got fifth place, about one and a half laps behind the first place. Sun Anting was in sixth place, about three laps behind the first place. Ryuzawa Shin was in last place, one lap behind Sun Anting. But Ryuzawa ran like an arrow in the last lap, as fast as a galloping horse, the same speed as the 400-meter race. The audience applauded for his spirit and perseverance.</p>

<p>(3) Japan Miyake Masamoto</p>
<p>(4) Japan Asakawa Masahisa</p>

<h3>First Japan-Philippines Baseball Game</h3>
<p>(Qian Hua)</p>
<p>10 to 4, Japan Wins</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: The first baseball game between Japan and the Philippines was held at the baseball field on the afternoon of the 25th at 2:30 PM. Because it was a Sunday, the weather was clear and sunny. Seeing their national team play, a crowd of Japanese spectators gathered, and tickets were sold out. There was almost no standing room in the field, making it an unprecedented spectacle since the Waseda-Keio baseball games. The umpire was Ikeda, and the base umpires were Miyake, Tenchi, and Fujita. The Philippine team batted first.</p>
<p>Score: Japan 28000000X 10</p>
<p>Philippines 000102010 4</p>
<p>In the first three innings, the Philippine team struggled to make progress against pitcher Miyatake's varied ball speed, which was difficult to read. When the Japanese team began their offense, they scored two points. By the second inning, they were doing as they pleased, hitting the ball at will, and scoring five consecutive points. The difference in strength and skill was vast. At this time, dark clouds filled the sky, and soon it rained heavily. The game was declared suspended. After ten minutes, the rain stopped and play resumed. The Philippine team changed pitchers, but still couldn't stop the Japanese offensive. The Japanese frequently loaded the bases, creating many dangerous situations. In this inning, Japan scored eight points, sealing the victory early. Afterwards, Miyatake's pitch lost some power due to conserved energy, so the Philippine team seized the opportunity to counterattack. The top five batters all got hits, successively scoring four points in the fourth, sixth, and eighth innings. In the end, Japan won a great victory with a score of 10 to 4.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Games</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly Similar Cheers: The Chinese cheering squad at the basketball court would erupt in cheers or slogans whenever a player entered the field or scored points. When playing against the Philippines, the Philippine team would also cheer in response. The Chinese team came up with a new trick, temporarily setting numbers like "1234554321" to music and singing it, while the Philippine team wouldn't be outdone, repeatedly singing "AB." Thus, "A" "B" "AAA" "BBB" "BA" "AB" "BBBBBB" left the audience in stitches.</p>
<p>Unable to Stop the Tears: Two girls' schools performed basketball at the venue, and one won while the other lost. The losing team was extremely sad and indignant. After leaving the field, they sat together on the grass, facing each other and weeping. Also, during a performance by two other girls' schools, a girl was hit in the chest and cried loudly. This was perhaps also a kind of embellishment.</p>
<h3>China-Japan Table Tennis Match</h3>
<p>Japan Wins in Both Team and Individual Events</p>
<p>Chinese Performance is Excellent</p>
<p>China Wins in Numazu</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The table tennis team arrived in Tokyo on the 24th. Individual matches were held on the 25th, and team matches were held on the 26th. The opening ceremony began with a report by Kido, followed by speeches by Count Arima. At ten o'clock, the referee, Ginka, blew the whistle, and applause thundered. After five hours of fierce competition, the individual championship was won by Murabayashi of the Japanese team. The team competition was divided into five groups. The results and skills are detailed below.</p>
<p>Chinese Team   Japanese Team   Result</p>
<p>(1) Zhou Jianwen   Murabayashi   0 to 3</p>
<p>(2) Lu Zhongqiu   Morita   3 to 0</p>
<p>(3) Huang Xiangfa   Aizawa   1 to 3</p>
<p>(4) Lu Xiuli   Fukushi   0 to 3</p>
<p>(5) Lu Shentong   Fujimura   1 to 0</p>
<h3>Chen Jiaqiu, Right Winger, Passes the Ball to Dai Linjing in the China Victory Soccer Match</h3>
<p>Zhou Jianwen unfortunately encountered Murabayashi, the individual champion. Murabayashi is the essence of all of Japan, good at both attacking and defending. In the individual final against Fukushi, he drew the ball forty-six times in a row, and Fukushi actually returned it, resulting in victory over Fukushi, showing his superb skill. Zhou's defeat was therefore inevitable. Lu Zhongqiu versus Morita, Morita is the Osaka individual champion, good at both drawing and hitting. He has defeated thousands of strong players in Osaka. Now, Lu surprisingly beat him with a drawn ball, setting a new record for Chinese table tennis. Huang Xiangfa versus Aizawa, although Huang Xiangfa lost, his performance still lived up to the name of a veteran. Lu Xiuli versus Fukushi, because Fukushi's skill was excellent, although Lu tried his best to draw the ball, there was no gap to enter. Lu Shentong versus Fujimura, Lu has always been good at close returns, and in the eyes of the Chinese, he was sure to win against the Japanese. Unexpectedly, he was completely out of form that day, returning the ball too high and losing more balls. The opponent's drawing and defending were effective, leading to defeat. Overall, in this match, if the Chinese team had made proper predictions and placed their strongest players at the back, the result would have been better. The Chinese are known for their defensive play, but they did a lot of drawing today, which surprised the Japanese. Japan was completely defensive, waiting for an opportunity, and the Chinese team was exhausted from the long journey, not sleeping all night on the train. They had only one day of rest before having to fight, so their defeat was not a sin of war. The battle of Numazu can prove this. After the competition on the 26th, Count Arima, chairman of the Japanese Table Tennis Association, held a get-together. The Japanese team mostly expressed their friendly intentions. Lin Zecang and Yu Binqi of the Chinese team also expressed the magnanimity of the Chinese people. They didn't say goodbye until sunset.</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that after the Chinese table tennis team finished the Tokyo competition, they took the train to Numazu City, near Yokohama, on the morning of the 28th to compete against local players. The results are added below.</p>
<h3>The Entire Philippine Team</h3>
<p>Chinese Team   Japanese Team   Result</p>
<p>(1) Lu Zhongqiu   Matsuoka   3 to 0</p>
<p>(2) Huang Xiangfa   Nimura   3 to 1</p>
<p>(3) Zhou Jianwen   Toyota   3 to 0</p>
<p>(4) Lu Shentong   Okawa   3 to 1</p>
<p>(5) Lu Xiuhai   Sugimoto   2 to 3</p>
<p>(6) Guo Fuhai   Kobayashi   3 to 2</p>

The participants were the Xicheng and Shihua teams. Although the championship of that group had already belonged to the invincible Tangwan, both sides still arrived on time and fought bravely. Their spirit of sportsmanship was commendable. In the first set, Xicheng excelled in both serving and returning, quickly creating a score of 21 to 1. In the second set, Shihua fought back hard, and their defense was also stable. The serving of No. 3 was particularly effective, so they initially gained the upper hand. However, Xicheng persevered, using back shots and cross-court hits, making unpredictable changes, causing Shihua to suffer another defeat. The score was 21 to 14, for a total of 2 to 0. Xicheng won. The referee was Zhang Longhai.</p>

<h3>New Work in the Scientific Community</h3>
<p>Summer Marine Biology Research Conference Scheduled to Open</p>
<p>Co-organized by Xiamen University and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture</p>
<p>As a Prelude to Building a Marine Biology Museum in China</p>
<p>(Xiamen Dispatch) Xiamen University and the Board of Directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, in order to further advance the progress of Chinese biological science in recent years, have specially organized a "Summer Marine Biology Research Conference" this year. The China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture is responsible for providing funds of 5,000 yuan, and Xiamen University is responsible for preparation and providing research institutes and all work equipment. The conference has invited well-known biology experts from various universities in the country to participate in the research work. Those who have responded include professors of biology from Guangdong Zhongshan University, Lingnan University, Northeastern University, Yenching University, Peking Union Medical College, Jinling University, Ginling Women's College, Soochow University, Shanghai University, St. John's University, Guanghua University, Zhijiang University, and Fuzhou Union University, totaling about twenty-five people. The conference is scheduled to open on July 14th. It is said that the important mission of the conference is, first, to seek progress in biological science from an organizational perspective, and also to plan the establishment of a marine biology museum in China. Recently, biological science has unanimously recognized the maxim of "studying living things, not reading dead books." European and American countries are competing to establish marine biology museums, and Japan already has two. Only our country lacks them, which is truly a great regret for the biological science community. However, establishing a marine biology museum requires two conditions: a building near the sea and abundant marine products. In our country's coastal areas, from Beigudao in the north to the south, along Yantai, Qingdao, Zhoushan, Shantou to Guangzhou, some areas have abundant marine products but no buildings, while others have buildings but are not near the sea. It is impossible to establish a marine biology museum at once. Only Xiamen University has magnificent buildings and is located right by the sea, and the abundance of marine products in the surrounding area surpasses all other places. This is truly the most suitable and easy place to build a marine biology museum in China. This year, the experts participating in the research conference are all shouldering this important responsibility, and after a month of discussion and planning,</p>
<h3>Situation at the Start of the 10,000 Meter Final</h3>
<p>It is bound to lead to some clues. Therefore, this research conference can also be said to be a prelude to the Chinese Marine Biology Museum. Xiamen Port has very rich marine products such as sea urchins, starfish, marine protozoa, and fish. The production of lancelets (Amphioxus) in Liuwudian is the highest in the world, so the area can provide everything needed for biological research. The address of the School of Biological Science of Xiamen University is on a small hill in the southeast corner of the school, next to the Zhenhai Customs built by Zheng Chenggong at the end of the Ming Dynasty. The building has three floors. The first floor is the animal room, the second floor is the plant room, and the third floor is the office. This year's research conference will temporarily use the first floor as a laboratory, with three large laboratories and six small laboratories, with flowing seawater to facilitate the study of living marine animals. It is also said that all travel expenses and accommodation costs for the experts participating in the conference will be provided by the conference. In addition to discussing the organization and establishment of the biological museum this year, each person will choose their own research topic without a fixed curriculum. When the second conference is held next year, various research classes can be opened, such as protozoa, marine animals, general physiology, embryology, etc., one or two classes, so that high school teachers, university teaching assistants, and advanced students can all participate, etc.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Slaughter Tax Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu slaughter tax is designated as a special fund for education in Jiangsu Province, which was not originally a problem. Since the division of municipalities and counties, the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai have considered the tax revenue within the city limits to be city-owned, and have therefore strongly argued for the tax to belong to the city. However, provincial schools are located in urban areas, and the dispute over the tax has led to the desire to transfer all provincial schools and educational institutions in urban areas to the city. This matter has been disputed by the province and the city for a long time and has not been resolved. Now it is heard that the central government has decided to maintain the original plan, and the slaughter tax will not be changed for the time being, and will still be used as a special fund for provincial education. The city will also temporarily postpone the takeover of provincial educational institutions in urban areas. The name of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office will also not be changed. However, it is heard that the education directors of the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai will join the Jiangsu Education Funding Committee as new members.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Drafts Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Curricula</h3>
<p>The Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee for Primary and Secondary Schools convened by the Ministry of Education has already finalized and printed the general curriculum. However, the various vocational subjects have not yet been completed. It is now heard that the courses for the various industrial groups are being drafted. The draft courses for the commercial subjects have been completely submitted by the drafting committee members, and the Ministry of Education will hold a review meeting in about a week or so, which can be approved and announced. The agricultural courses were previously presided over by Mr. Qian Tianhe, who hired various members to draft them separately. They are divided into groups such as "Agriculture," "Animal Husbandry," "Sericulture," and "Forestry." Except for the animal husbandry group, which has not yet completed the draft, most of the others are roughly ready. Recently, the Ministry of Education sent a letter urging the drafting committee members to send the drafted courses to the ministry as soon as possible, so that they can be grouped and hold meetings to complete them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Tenth Anniversary of Suzhou Women's Vocational School</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Private Jiangsu Women's Vocational School held its tenth anniversary celebration the day before yesterday.

<h3>Mr. Maguelre Gave a Speech at Labor University Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Labor University invited Dr. Maguelre of France to give a speech. The doctor came to the school with Ding Zhaoqing and Zhu Shaoping at 9:00 AM. The speech began at 10:00 AM, entitled "China in Europe." Secretary-General Xiong of the school first expressed his welcome, and then Dr. Ma took the stage to give his speech. The gist of it was that Chinese culture has had a profound and significant impact on Europe. In ancient times, due to transportation difficulties, the impact was not very obvious. However, since the 18th century, a major change has occurred in European society, and external culture is needed for adjustment. Therefore, the cultural essence of China, such as politics, philosophy, literature, and art, was transmitted to Europe and was very popular. In various aspects of modern European culture, Chinese colors are deeply dyed and become more and more obvious. After Mr. Ma finished speaking, Dr. Xia Zhaoqing continued to give a speech, saying that the school's labor education was very successful and admirable. Dr. Ma is only 28 years old, but his knowledge is profound and he is a model for the students of the school. He hoped that the young people would work hard.</p>
<h3>Important News from Jinan University</h3>
<p>Since National Jinan University implemented the college-based administrative system, the departments have been thriving. The president's office receives dozens of letters from various places at home and abroad every day inquiring about the enrollment date or requesting regulations. It is heard that due to the limitations of school buildings and funding, the 19th-year enrollment plan has been discussed and decided at the 13th school affairs meeting. (1) Each department is limited to ten students. (2) Each department generally does not recruit transfer students. (3) The middle school department does not accept domestic students except for the children of faculty and staff. (4) Female students are limited to overseas Chinese students and the daughters of faculty and staff. (5) The appropriate time limit for overseas Chinese students to return to China for examinations will be notified to various overseas departments by the Ministry of Culture. The school, due to special circumstances, did not enroll students last year except for the law department. If there are outstanding young people in the country this year who are interested in applying to the university department, they can prepare their homework early for the examination. It is good that the opportunity for the school to enroll students is not easy and should not be missed. In addition, in the recent three years, political science, economics, law, diplomacy, and other specialized subjects have been established in order. The law school has been enriched, and it has also been decided to restore it based on the facts. Due to insufficient housing, it will be temporarily moved to Shanghai for operation. When the new house is completed, it will be moved back to the Zhenru headquarters. Also, according to the decision of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Education Conference to dispatch Nanyang Overseas Chinese Education Inspection Commissioners, it has also been decided to temporarily dispatch seven people in the 19th year, one each from the five colleges of arts, science, education, commerce, and law, and the middle school department, and the Ministry of Culture, to depart after the autumn semester for a period of three months in October, November, and December. Each member will receive a subsidy of 2,000 yuan. After the inspection, they must make a comprehensive improvement plan for the school in order to express the special spirit of overseas Chinese schools. It is expected that the future of overseas Chinese education will show a different color.</p>

<h3>Today's June 3rd Memorial</h3>
<p>Time... 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Location... Business Readjustment Association</p>
<p>The June 3rd Opium Prohibition Memorial, jointly prepared by the Shanghai Special City Party Department, the Special City Government, and the Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association, is ready. Yesterday, various levels of Party, government, and organizational bodies in the city held memorial week activities, adding anti-drug speeches and oaths, which were very enthusiastic. Today at 9:00 AM, a memorial meeting will be held at the auditorium of the Business Readjustment Association at Tianhougong Bridge in the city. Each level of the Party, administrative organs, and organizations should send five representatives to participate. A special memorial issue will be published in major newspapers today for publicity. This afternoon, Mrs. Cai Gengshi will give a speech on the radio, with Ms. Bai Zhiying as the chairwoman. The following is a summary of what we have gathered:</p>
<p>Propaganda Outline: The meaning and origin of the June 3rd Memorial. The import of opium into our country was the beginning of imperialist economic aggression. From the Daoguang three years (1823) to eighteen years (1838) of the former Qing Dynasty, the silver lost due to opium exports increased from 17 million taels to 30 million taels annually. At the same time, the entire nation, addicted to opium, was mostly emaciated and haggard, facing the danger of national destruction. At that time, Mr. Lin Zexu handled the opium prohibition, confiscating 20,283 chests of opium from British merchants and destroying them all at Humen, to the joy of the whole country. Today marks the 91st anniversary. Mr. Lin's destruction of opium was to demonstrate the justice of our nation and the fairness of the world, making him the vanguard of China's anti-drug movement. His great spirit is worthy of commemoration. However, due to the destruction, the Opium War was triggered, leading to military defeat and national humiliation, with justice not upheld and fairness not realized. Until now, imperialist aggression has become increasingly severe, and the harm of opium has not been completely eradicated. If we hope to implement opium prohibition, fundamentally eliminate the scourge of opium, and overthrow all imperialist aggression, then it is especially worthwhile to commemorate the fundamental starting date of the Opium War, "June 3rd." The June 3rd Memorial was proposed to the National Government by Dr. Wang Jingqi, the current chairman of the Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association, who is fighting against drugs in overseas international alliances. The National Government also issued a nationwide unified order for its observance, indicating the importance and greatness of the June 3rd Memorial. Mr. Lin's legacy includes many impassioned statements and methods in his memorial urging the prohibition of opium. We now excerpt a few paragraphs below: The poison of opium is worse than floods and fierce beasts. No one in the world would consider opium not worthy of prohibition. If this disaster is not eliminated, we will have no usable soldiers or resources to plan with in ten years. The spread of opium in the interior is like the spread of carbuncles and sores on the human body. When carbuncles and sores grow, they gradually produce pus. When opium comes, it gradually leads to invaders. We must eliminate opium completely to eradicate the root of the disease. Mr. Lin's opium prohibition after the destruction of opium: After Mr. Lin prohibited opium, Britain sent troops to Guangzhou, Dinghai, Ningbo, and Bohai, one after another, for the sake of the dishonorable opium trade. At that time, coastal border officials failed in their duties, and everyone slandered Mr. Lin, saying he was the culprit who started the war. The Qing court, facing difficult diplomacy, removed him from office. After the peace agreement was reached, the Qing court, under the pressure of imperialism, could not talk about opium prohibition, but opium continued to be imported. Before Guangxu two years (1876), there is no way to verify. From two years onwards until the Republic of China seventeen years (1928), in the fifty-three years in between, the foreign opium imported cost the customs 130 million taels of silver. At the end of Guangxu, a ten-year eradication agreement was finally made with Britain. After the ten-year period expired, it was surprisingly eradicated nationwide. Unexpectedly, after the Republic of China year five, local warlords embraced troops to defend themselves, levied opium taxes to protect the trafficking and consumption of opium, colluding with imperialism, filling the foreign lands. After the end of the European War, narcotics such as morphine, heroin, and cocaine took the opportunity to be imported, spreading disaster throughout the country, making it even more unmanageable. After the establishment of the Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association, it followed Mr. Lin and the Premier's anti-drug legacy, vigorously advocating to stop the import of foreign opium and narcotics, and to eradicate the domestic cultivation, trafficking, and sale of opium and narcotics. After several years of running around and calling out, it aroused national sympathy. After the establishment of the National Government, the suggestion was made to transition from the opium monopoly system to a complete prohibition policy, establishing a Prohibition Committee. However, in the past two years, due to the deep-rooted habits of the people and the evil forces of imperialism, which have not yet been eradicated, the implementation of opium prohibition has encountered various difficulties. The domestic cultivation of opium has not yet been eradicated, and the trafficking and consumption in various places still cause many problems. Mr. Lin and the late Premier's anti-drug legacy have not yet been fully achieved. Our necessary understanding and efforts: Our country has been brought to this point internationally, and the people's livelihood at home has been brought to such poverty, all because of the Opium War, which wrote a bill of sale in the form of the Treaty of Nanjing and all the unequal treaties that started from it. If we want to abolish unequal treaties, the fundamental thing is for everyone to work hard to completely ban opium and all narcotics that replace opium. Mr. Lin and the Premier's fearless spirit are worthy of our emulation. However, opium prohibition and anti-narcotics are not simple matters.

<p>Draft Proposal for the Construction of a Lin Zexu Memorial Hall</p>
<p>Reason: Mr. Lin Zexu was the first to advocate opium prohibition. His heroic spirit is admired forever. Today, the opium scourge is rampant and ever-increasing. Shanghai is the focus of attention both domestically and internationally, and it is the place where sovereignty was lost after the defeat in the Opium War. We advocate anti-narcotics, remember the legacy of our predecessors, promote the spirit of our predecessors, and thoroughly eradicate narcotics, and we should have an appropriate memorial to set an example. As we commemorate the 91st anniversary of Mr. Lin's destruction of foreign opium, at the time of the memorial meeting held in this city, we specially put forward this case to select several items for discussion, and respectfully ask for a decision.</p>
<p>Measures (1) Organize a committee for the construction of the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall and specially invite other members to handle it. (2) The Memorial Hall will be equipped with an anti-drug library to collect Chinese and foreign publications on anti-drugs, both ancient and modern. (3) The Memorial Hall will be equipped with an anti-drug art museum to display various exhibits and other artistic products related to anti-drugs. (4) The Memorial Hall will be equipped with a narcotic drug treatment research institute to engage in chemical experiments and research on smoking cessation drugs. (5) The Memorial Hall will be equipped with a model smoking cessation hospital to accommodate smokers and implement cessation. (6) A portion of the Memorial Hall should be set aside to commemorate people who have made contributions to anti-narcotics, displaying photographs and memorial monuments, etc. (7) The fundraising method for the Memorial Hall can be based on the budget of each part, and donors or groups can be invited to take responsibility separately to achieve integration. (8) The address of the Memorial Hall can be requested from the municipal government to allocate public property to fill it. (9) The construction and equipment of the Memorial Hall can be determined according to the economic situation (original manuscript missing below)</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang's Letter to the People Zhang Zhijiang's letter to the people for the Opium Prohibition Memorial Day says: Why is June 3rd the Opium Prohibition Memorial Day? It is because June 3rd, ninety-one years ago, was the beginning of a strong struggle against the opium policy of the imperialists against China in Chinese history. At that time, the government was not a revolutionary government, and the environment was not a revolutionary environment. The sage Lin Zexu alone was able to be unyielding, uncompromising, and irreconcilable, setting fire to 20,083 boxes of opium from British merchants, without the slightest hesitation or consideration, thus chilling the courage of foreign merchants and boosting the spirit of the people. If the Manchu government of that day had not been confused and had not hindered him, allowing him to complete his work, then the opium scourge in China would have been cleared long ago. However, since Qishan misled the country and the war was lost, it has resulted in the land of 5,000 years of civilization, the offspring of 400 million gods, whose qualifications could have surpassed Europe and America and soared in East Asia, being transformed into a weakling unable to recover and faltering under the constraints of unequal treaties by various imperialists, allowing them to oppress and slaughter at will, causing the people's blood and the nation's rights and interests to leak out like a goblet and flow like a river, overflowing and unrecoverable. And now it is approaching poverty and danger. Alas, is this not what Mr. Lin's spirit in heaven is lamenting and what our revolutionary party should strive to achieve after admiring the sage, seeking to achieve the goal of opium prohibition and saving the country? Because since the Opium War failed, it started the trend of ceding land and paying indemnities. Since the Opium War failed, it led to the gradual loss of rights and national humiliation. Since the Opium War failed, the bullying of unequal treaties by various imperialists came together. Since the Opium War failed, opium prohibition was greatly relaxed, and the scourge spread throughout the country like mercury pouring onto the ground, entering everywhere without any holes. Even after repeated strict orders, it could not be saved. If the imperialists were to indulge in harming us with opium and if our people had not transported, sold, or bought it before the Opium War, then Mr. Lin would not have had to destroy opium on June 3rd, and the war could have been avoided. Even after the Opium War, if the people had known shame and aroused themselves, and were all able to take Mr. Lin's heart as their own, there would be no reason why the opium scourge would not be eradicated. But how could they be so immersed in pleasure, wasting their lives away, for nearly a hundred years? June 3rd comes once a year, and the eradication of opium is far off and hopeless. Alas, I think about it, I think about it again, how can I get Mr. Lin down from the Nine Heavens, so that he can transform into 400 million people, holding my stubborn and unresponsive people, one by one, and drumming up their courage, inspiring their spirit, and urging them to rise up together and fight a life-and-death battle with opium, to wash away the great shame of a century of national humiliation and disease, and restore the vigorous and rising atmosphere? If we can do this, is it not a happy event? Unfortunately, it is impossible. Then I think of Mr. Lin back then, as a lonely minister in the Lingnan region, facing great difficulties, overcoming opposition, unmoved by enticements, and undeterred by threats. I can imagine the scene of the opium destruction at that time, with the flames burning brightly and the national prestige being magnificent. His sincerity touched even the pigs and fish, and the foreign merchants who came to Guangdong willingly obeyed. This is recorded in the national history and is not false. His noble character should last forever and be renewed throughout the universe. Although the person is gone, his spirit remains. We do not need to see his full picture, but if each of the 400 million people can each get one percent, one thousandth, or one ten-thousandth of Mr. Lin's spirit as a seed, sprouting as a root and growing, either having the power to resist opium in a country, or having the power to resist opium in a township, or having the power to resist opium in a family, or even having only the power to resist opium in oneself, and thus cut oneself off from opium, if all 400 million people can cut themselves off from opium, the impact on the future of opium prohibition will be extremely rapid and significant. The only question is, how can this be achieved? The June 3rd Opium Prohibition Memorial is precisely to arouse the great attention of the 400 million people on this month and this day, so that each person recalls the humiliation of the Opium War and stirs up their spirits, remotely connecting with the spirit of the sage Lin Zexu ninety-one years ago, striving to transform the spirit of one person, Mr. Lin, on that day into the spirit of 400 million people today. Alas, is this the meaning of the Opium Prohibition Memorial Day being designated on June 3rd? It is hoped that the people of the whole country will use this memorial day to deeply consider the meaning of the memorial, recall the past scourge of opium on the country, and then be startled and admire Mr. Lin's destruction of opium, and then realize and look forward to the future, and then be happy and joyful, startled by the fact that the scourge of opium has reached its highest point and can no longer be allowed to spread, realizing that Mr. Lin is also a person, and so am I, and I but slightly have the spirit of Mr. Lin, and the cause of opium prohibition can be greatly accomplished, happy that if the people work together from now on, opium and narcotics will never be seen again under the clear sky and bright sun. If this is the case, then Mr. Lin's spirit can be passed down to the people through the Opium Prohibition Memorial, and the spirit of the people can also be conveyed to Mr. Lin through the Opium Prohibition Memorial. With this opium prohibition, no opium will not be prohibited. With this eradication of drugs, no drug will not be eradicated. If we can achieve this from this year onwards, and if we can cooperate nationwide, the opium scourge can be hoped to be eradicated, and if we can go through another year, and then go through countless years, the annual opium prohibition memorial will not only commemorate June 3rd, ninety-one years ago, but will also commemorate today's June 3rd as the last memorial day for the opium forces, and at the same time commemorate it. If we can sincerely do this, then I will pray and wish for our people and respectfully wish you success.</p>

<p>The construction of the Sun Yat-sen bronze statue was initiated in the year 17 of the Republic of China, proposed by the Shanghai Special City Party Department, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Shanghai Special City Government, and the Jinghu Huhangyong Railway Administration. Representatives from various agencies and groups were invited to open meetings and make resolutions to organize the Shanghai North Station Construction Sun Yat-sen Bronze Statue Committee. On the birthday of Sun Yat-sen on March 12 of that year, a groundbreaking ceremony for the bronze statue was held at the square of Shanghai North Station. Donation booklets were printed and distributed to various agencies and groups to solicit funds for the statue. Later, due to changes in personnel in various agencies, no one was in charge, and the matter was suspended. In the winter of last year, the Jinghu Huhangyong Railway Administration re-invited representatives from various agencies and groups to meet and discuss the continuation of fundraising. It is now reported that the estimated amount of funds raised is nearly 30,000 yuan. It is reported that eleven agency representatives were recently elected as construction committee members, and a construction committee was established. The Shanghai Special City Party Department, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Shanghai Special City Government, the Jinghu Huhangyong Railway Administration, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai were elected as standing committee members, responsible for carrying out the construction work. At 4:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, the construction committee and the standing committee were reconvened in the meeting hall on the second floor of the North Station Road Bureau. It is reported that those present included representatives from the Lianglu Railway Administration, Wang Jichang and Zheng Shian, representatives from the Shanghai Special City Party Department, Ye Xiufu, representatives from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Taiji, representatives from the Exchange Federation, Wen Lanting, and Wang Xiaolai, Wang Binyan, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, and representatives from the Shanghai Local Court, Wang Pengjun. Mr. Wang Xiaolai was elected as the temporary chairman of the standing committee, and Mr. Yu Hongxiang from the Road Bureau took minutes. Regarding the construction matters, it was resolved to publish in the newspaper to solicit bronze statue designs, and then concentrate on the plans of Shanghai's statue casting experts before bidding for construction. It is reported that the estimated completion date is the Double Ten Festival of this year, and the latest deadline shall not exceed January 1, 20th year of the Republic of China. It is reported that Shanghai art experts are very enthusiastically responding to the solicitation, and it is expected that in less than half a year, the bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen, the great man of the world and the leader of the Chinese revolution, will stand majestically in the square of Shanghai North Station, the largest commercial port in our country, attracting the attention of tens of thousands of people.</p>

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<h3>Sincere Consideration for Chinese Merchants' Shipping</h3>
<p>Please Request Anhui Provincial Government to Postpone Pier and Pontoon Construction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association sent a letter to the General Administration of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, saying: Dear Sirs, previously, the Anhui Provincial Government planned to set up public piers and pontoons in Anqing to attract foreign ships to dock, which would affect the business of Chinese ships and harm the national character and shipping rights. We requested that you submit a request to stop it in order to protect national rights, etc. We have separately submitted reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and the Anhui Provincial Government to instruct them to stop it, and we have also received a copy of the approval from the Ministry of Communications on the 26th of last month. Now, we have received document number 52 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which states: Received. Although Anqing is not a trading port, the permission for foreign ships to dock is already stipulated in treaties and regulations. However, passengers and goods have always been loaded and unloaded by civilian ships. According to Inspector Li, it was suggested to set up pontoons, and the Anhui Provincial Government approved the proposal. According to the case report of the Construction Department, the department's expanded special meeting was proposed by member Yu Xizhang and passed by the conference. The Anqing Municipal Administration Preparatory Office also made this request. This shows that the drawbacks are obvious and everyone agrees. This time, the proposed pontoons are purely to facilitate domestic merchants and travelers, not to benefit foreign ships. Moreover, they are set up and managed by us, and pontoon taxes can be levied. This measure is taken for the implementation of administrative power, so how can it be said to damage national sovereignty? Furthermore, the right of foreign ships to dock in Anqing will not be increased or decreased due to the existence of pontoons, and the route of foreign ships on the Yangtze River will not be lengthened or shortened due to the existence of Anqing pontoons. This is very clear. However, according to the association's report that it hinders the business of Chinese merchants, the Ministry of Communications also approved the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's report, which is the same. Now is the time to protect the shipping industry, and the government will never want to harm the people by seeking to benefit them. Since this case has been expressed by the domestic shipping industry as hindering the business of Chinese merchants, the Ministry has already sent a reply to the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting a postponement and finding other ways to ensure the safety of merchants and travelers. You are hereby informed.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Limit Gold Prices to No More Than 500 Taels</p>
<p>Prohibit Transactions on the Exchange for Gold Speculation</p>
<p>Petition from the District Office: The Sixth District and Tenth Branch of the Shanghai Special Municipality submitted a document requesting the cessation of gold speculation transactions on the exchange, stating: (Omitted above) Due to the soaring gold prices, the market is in turmoil. We implore the government to halt gold speculation transactions on the exchange to safeguard the national foundation. The exorbitant rise in gold prices, reaching over 550 taels, results in significant losses in international settlements. Shops and money houses in Shanghai are collapsing daily, placing our nation's finances in a precarious state. According to the Exchange Law, the government has the authority to suspend trading in the event of substantial market fluctuations, and there are precedents to follow. Currently, gold prices are rising daily, threatening a precipitous decline. If no measures are taken to prevent it, the impact on the national economy and people's livelihoods will be immense. Therefore, after a resolution by the party members' congress, we telegraph the government to issue a clear order to stop gold speculation transactions, thereby avoiding manipulation by foreigners causing drastic price crashes. This will also prevent our national finances from falling into bankruptcy. We hereby record this petition and request that it be forwarded to the government to issue a clear order prohibiting gold speculation transactions on the exchange, thereby safeguarding the national foundation. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Song Shixiang's Proposal: Mr. Song Shixiang, a member of the Chamber of Commerce Readjustment Committee, proposed a motion to the committee due to the soaring gold prices, market panic, and the shaking of the national foundation. The original text of his motion is as follows: (Omitted above) Believing that the soaring gold prices are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihoods, the member previously proposed prohibiting the import of silver. Although the government issued a ban a month ago, it was too late to reverse the tide. Now, the price of gold has soared to 550 taels, an unprecedented level, causing extreme market panic, which will inevitably lead our country into a crisis. After repeated discussions among the members, the current relief method should be for your committee to urgently telegraph the government to stabilize the gold price, restricting it to a limit of no more than 500 taels, so that foreign exchange can be stabilized immediately. We also request that the government investigate and follow the Exchange Regulations regarding market price fluctuations, issuing a clear order prohibiting gold speculation transactions. Furthermore, the government already has a clear provision for taxing silver bars for a six-month trial period. We also request your committee to telegraph the government to instruct the customs to strictly enforce this provision. Is this appropriate? We respectfully request a public decision for implementation.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Chamber of Commerce Readjustment Committee Go to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>To Request the Return of Placement of Unemployed Pharmaceutical Workers</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Readjustment Committee, in order to petition the Central Government to request the return of the placement of unemployed pharmaceutical workers, after a meeting of the entire committee, publicly elected Yu Qiaqing, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, and Wen Lanting as five committee members as representatives, to petition various party and government institutions in Beijing and Shanghai. These five representatives have repeatedly consulted with the Municipal Party Headquarters and Municipal Government in this city, and have obtained considerable solutions. Last night, they took the train to Beijing to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The petition is recorded below: Submitting for the sake of unemployed pharmaceutical workers, it is proposed to be revised to be introduced by the affiliated merchant pharmaceutical groups themselves, exempt from checking the review list, to place them so as to take care of both sides and resolve disputes, hoping for approval to be followed. Case check: The Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city, due to the issue of the Central Government's unresolved dispute over the placement of unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry, drafted six regulations, only one of which, the replacement system, is factually impossible to exist. According to the list approved by the Party Headquarters, the placement of more than 64 people is considered to still contain mandatory characteristics, and is greatly related to the store's business survival. It is still requested to be transferred back to withdraw the order, etc., and was transferred on the 16th of this month. Various industry groups in this city, because this matter has been prolonged and has not been appropriately resolved, and the wind of the workers of various industries preparing to succeed has become tighter day by day, and they have no choice but to plan methods to deal with it. Therefore, in addition to the last 44 groups that jointly wrote to request the convening of a representative meeting of various industries, there are another 15 industry associations that continue to make this request. The affiliated associations, in view of the increasing agitation of commercial sentiment, convened the 13th plenary meeting on the 22nd and 23rd of this month (May) to propose a discussion. All believed that the panic in various industries was caused by the pharmaceutical industry, and the dispute in the pharmaceutical industry this time, The most important one of the six regulations drafted by the Central Government is to limit the hiring of workers who have passed the review of the Mediation Committee, and the number is about 64 or more. The difference between priority hiring and forced placement is not in the words used, but in whether the store actually has the sovereignty to consider itself. Now, if more than 64 people are limited, the store does not have the power to reduce the quota. The situation is not as before that each store can accommodate a few people. The limit is that the investigation committee secretly checks and passes the qualification. Even if there are those with bad habits and poor skills, the store has no right to deny it. Whether the store actually needs so many people or not, whether the personnel are really appropriate or not, there is no room for control or consideration at all. Even if the word "hiring" is still used in the name, the spirit is mandatory.</p>
<p>The authorities of this city have already expressed the intention to enforce it forcibly. Impartially considering it, there is no difference between it and forced placement.</p>
<p>Since the National Government's approval has determined that forced placement is inappropriate, the pharmaceutical industry cannot but request relief based on this approval. Therefore, for the clause that limits the hiring of more than 64 people who have passed the review, we cannot but request to withdraw the order. Also, Article 27 of the Labor Union Law states that the labor union cannot restrict the employer from using the people it introduces. In other words, it cannot force the introduction. The original purpose of this regulation was to preserve the employer's right to employ people. Even if there are differences in the wording of forced placement, there is no difference in nature. In a word, anything that hinders the employer's right to employ people is not allowed by law.</p>
<p>The labor union itself cannot forcibly demand from the store. Based on the same reason, it cannot request the national agency to forcibly place it.</p>
<p>Moreover, the standard of the so-called "qualified by the party and government agencies," whether the standard of the word "qualified" is consistent with the actual situation, only the store that has worked together for many years can deeply understand the bottom line, and it is definitely not something that outsiders can propose on their behalf. If there is another qualification standard other than this, then the actual situation of the qualified person may run counter to what the store needs, and the store believes that it should request to withdraw the order. This is also the key point. If it is said that without the procedures of the party and government agencies, there is a concern that reactionary elements may be mixed in, then the store regards the reactionary elements almost like snakes and scorpions. There is nothing more to add to their fear and desire to reject them. There is absolutely no opening the door to invite thieves or self-harm. However, this case has been held up for a long time, and both sides are unfavorable, and the Central and Municipal Party and Government authorities in this city have made great efforts to provide relief to unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry, and the store should also admire it. However, only if it does not hinder the scope of the central approval, national law, and the store's sovereignty, the pharmaceutical industry should also try its best to make it difficult, in order to achieve both. It is proposed that the affiliated associations and pharmaceutical groups select those with docile characteristics from among the unemployed workers and do their best to take responsibility for introduction, and do not limit the number and names of those who have passed the review. The rest should follow the regulations drafted by the Central Government, separately give funds and send them back to their original places. After this separate processing, there are no more unemployed pharmaceutical workers within the city area, and the replacement system is no longer possible to exist, and should be discussed as a debate and need not be handled separately. The resolution is based on the above two items, and Yu Qiaqing, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, and Wen Lanting are elected to go to the capital to petition the party and government agencies. It is appropriate to prepare a document for submission, and hand it over to the petition representative to submit to the appropriate Ministry and Government. May the audit be approved and implemented, it will be publicly convenient. (June 2nd)</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Shipping on the Upper Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The upper reaches of the Yangtze River, as a rule, during the summer flood season, is the busiest time for import and export goods, but recently, due to various reasons, the situation of stagnation of all kinds of goods has suddenly appeared. The outflow of goods from central Hunan has become increasingly low, and various shipping companies in this port have already agreed to lower the water freight of the largest commodity, cotton yarn, to 1 tael and 9 qian per piece, in order to encourage customers to attract goods. Now, seeing that there is no hope of revival, the companies are even considering reducing the number of shifts. The recent news is reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>Reduction of Shifts on Ships to Yichang: Since last year, various foreign merchants in Shanghai to Yichang Shashi have dispatched direct ships. The Taikoo's Poyang wheel went to Yichang last time to Xindi and collided violently with this company's iron barge Xinyang, and the bow of Poyang was damaged. It was towed back to Shanghai on an empty ship and entered the factory for major repairs. It was completed yesterday and resumed service this morning. However, it happened to encounter a stagnation of goods on the upper river, so the ship decided to only go to Hankou and temporarily not sail to Shashi, to avoid the loss of empty航行.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Goods Shipped to Hunan: Starting last week, the outflow of goods from Shanghai to Changsha, Xiangtan, Yuezhou and other places plummeted, and the export business from Shashi also declined sharply. Japanese ships sailing in Hunan have telegraphed Shanghai, requesting the First Overseas Dispatch Team of the Japanese Navy to urgently dispatch the warship Ataka to escort them in Hunan.</p>
<p>Drop in Passenger Ticket Prices on the Upper River: Taikoo, Jardine, Nisshin, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company agreed that the price of passenger tickets on the Upper River will jointly drop from June 1st, and a new rate has been drafted as follows:</p>
<p>Destination 1st Class New Price Original Price Third Class Price</p>
<p>Xindi 12 yuan None None</p>
<p>Yuezhou 16 20 yuan 3 yuan</p>
<p>Shashi 36 45 6</p>
<p>Changsha 20 25 6</p>
<p>Yichang 40 50 9</p>
<p>Wanxian 36 None 3</p>
<p>Chongqing 72 None 9</p>
<p>Ning Shao Wheel is Approved to Resume Service: Within the past week, it was originally scheduled that the Changjiang Hualun of this area needed 11 ships to stop service, and the Zhaoxing Changxing and other ships were all temporarily suspended. The Ning Shao wheel was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, and after unloading the incoming goods, it would stop commercial shifts. After repeated consultations by the company, it was approved to resume business. Therefore, starting tomorrow, the ship can still resume the Yangtze River, and a total of ten Yangtze River ships have been suspended, but the Changjiang ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can still operate as usual.</p>

<p>Big A-Shi and Little A-Shi Playing</p>
<p>Tragedy Strikes While Playing with a Handgun</p>
<p>Around 6:45 last night, a shooting occurred near Route Ferguson in the French Concession, resulting in the death of a five-year-old child. The circumstances are quite bizarre. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Laundry Worker's Family: Behind a nine-story building near Route Ferguson in the French Concession, in an area called Chenjia Lane, amidst green fields, resembling a village, lives Qiu Guiquan, a man from Ningbo in his forties. He works as a laundry worker for a Western manager at the Xiangmao Soap factory near Hongqiao Airport. He is married to Wang, and they have a son and a daughter. The daughter, named A-Mao, is seven years old, and the son, named A-Shi, is just five years old. The family rents a flat in the Chenjia Lane from an old widow named Chen.</p>
<p>Li A-Tu Frequently Visits: The homeowner, the old widow Chen, lives next door to Qiu. About a mile northeast in Chenjia Lane, in the Li family residence, lives Li A-Shi, who lives off ancestral land and is essentially an unemployed vagrant. He is acquainted with the widow Chen. Every day at dusk, Li comes to Chen's house to play, which has become his habit. Over time, he has become friends with Qiu. Because Qiu works as a laundry worker, Li occasionally brings clothes to Chen's house, asking Qiu to wash them. Around 6:45 last night, Qiu had not yet returned home. Qiu's wife, Wang, was visiting a neighbor who was ill when Li arrived unhurriedly.</p>
<p>Suddenly Playing with a Handgun: As Li entered the bamboo fence gate of Chen's house, he saw Qiu's son and daughter eating dinner at a small table near the entrance. Li approached the table, chatting and joking with the two children. Somehow, he suddenly took out a handgun to play with. Unfortunately, he accidentally touched the trigger. With a "bang," a bullet came out of the gun and struck Qiu's son, A-Shi, in the right hand, going straight into his mouth and piercing the back of his neck. By the time Wang heard the noise and rushed out to investigate, both the old fellow and the young fellow were pale. Qiu's son immediately fell to the ground and died shortly after.</p>
<p>The Culprit Flees: Wang saw her beloved son shot to death and immediately grabbed Li, shouting for help. The old widow Chen also heard the commotion and rushed out. Li A-Shi then seized the opportunity to escape. At the same time, Qiu returned home and was shocked by the news. He immediately reported it to the Shanzhong Road Police Station. Upon hearing the news, the police chief immediately ordered detectives to investigate and tracked Li to his residence, but Li had already vanished without a trace. The body of Qiu's son was reported for inspection today.</p>

French police arrived and took the sailor and the woman into custody. A tourist wearing a white long gown intended to come forward as a witness but was discovered by the other American sailors. They followed the tourist to a secluded place and severely beat them. Fortunately, nearby police officers heard the noise and rushed over, and the sailors left.</p>
<p>Marrying a Wife Under the Pretense of a Nephew</p>
<h3>In Reality, He is Taking a Concubine Himself</h3>
<p>Li Qianyi Sues Jin Qidi</p>
<p>Requests a Judgment to Dissolve the Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Lian Di Herself Willing to be a Concubine</p>
<p>Official Advises Out-of-Court Settlement</p>
<p>Li Qianyi, a resident of Tianjin, lives at No. 6 outside the Southeast Gate of Zhenru Town. He has a second daughter named Lian Di, who is sixteen years old. In February of this year, through matchmakers Zuo Kuiyuan and an old woman named Chen Yaoshi, she was promised in marriage to Jin Qidi (also known as Jin Zhixian), the nephew of No. 96, Dajin Lane, Zhoujiaqiao, in the western suburbs of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jin Marries Her as a Concubine: It was stated that the bride price was 400 yuan. On March 17, 200 yuan was paid as an initial payment, and the remaining 200 yuan was to be paid later. Lian Di was immediately brought into the family. Unexpectedly, she was not betrothed to Qidi's nephew but was taken by Qidi as</p>
<p>His Third Concubine: They were married on the 20th of last month. Li Qianyi was greatly surprised to learn the truth. He believed that Jin Qidi should not have deceived them into the betrothal, using the name of marrying his nephew to take her as his own concubine. Therefore, he hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file a complaint with the local court, requesting</p>
<p>Dissolution of the Marriage Contract: The defendant, Jin Qidi, also hired lawyer Lu Jiazi to present a defense. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Jinjian specially opened the Fourth Tribunal to hear the case. First, the plaintiff, Li Qianyi, testified that he was 46 years old, from Tianjin, previously involved in the cloth factory business, and now unemployed at home. He also stated the details of the situation and claimed that</p>
<p>a young man came to the matchmaking, claiming to be the defendant's nephew. He never thought that the defendant was deceiving them all along. Now, according to the matchmakers who came to his house, Jin Qidi's nephew is only 21 years old and has houses and land, which would be a good match. At the time, he asked for 600 yuan for the betrothal gift, but they agreed on 400 yuan, and he first sent 200 yuan. His daughter was immediately brought into the family. He later learned that she was actually taken as a concubine by the defendant, but his daughter is only</p>
<p>Sixteen Years Old: The defendant is the same age as him, 46 years old. He really does not want this and asks for the court to order the dissolution of the marriage contract, etc. The defendant, Jin Qidi, testified that he was 46 years old and a local. The judge asked how many women he had in his household. (Answer) Three: his first wife, Lu; his concubine, Min; and Xu. But Lian Di's last name is not Li but Xu because he is</p>
<p>Maintaining Two Ancestral Lines: and has no children. Moreover, his nephew passed away six or seven years ago. As for Lian Di coming into the family as a concubine, it was agreed upon beforehand. On January 26th of this year, he paid a betrothal gift of 212 yuan, and on April 20th, he paid another 58 yuan, totaling 270 yuan. The betrothal gifts have already been paid in full. The judge asked why he was being sued. (Answer) He does not know. At the time, the matchmaker said that Lian Di was a virgin. In reality, Lian Di was sold to</p>
<p>Qingdao as a Prostitute: (Asked) Are your feelings good with Lian Di? (Answer) Yes. The judge ordered Li Lian Di to come to the case to testify. She is sixteen years old and her last name is Xu, not Li. Her biological father has passed away, and she does not know Li Qianyi. (Asked) Who is Jin Qidi to you? (Answer) He is my husband. (Asked) Are you married? (Answer) No. (Asked) Who exactly is Li Qianyi to you? (Answer) He is a friend of my father. (Asked) How did you live after your father's death? (Answer) My father ran a firewood shop before his death. (Asked) Who did you give all the betrothal gifts to? (Answer) I gave them to my grandfather (referring to Li Qianyi). At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stood up and said, "Please note, Your Honor, that Lian Di admits that the plaintiff is her father, and Lian Di also testified that she</p>
<p>Voluntarily Became a Concubine: etc." The judge ordered witness Chen Yaoshi to come to the case to testify. She is 60 years old and testified that Lian Di is a concubine. Zuo Kuiyuan, 39 years old, from Baoding, testified that he was indeed the matchmaker. The betrothal gift was indeed 400 yuan, and 200 yuan was paid. At the time, Lian Di was betrothed to Jin Qidi's nephew as a wife, but after coming into the family, he did not know how she became Qidi's concubine, but both parties were willing to do so, etc. The judge, upon receiving the testimony, mediated for them in court, ordering the defendant to give the plaintiff some more betrothal gifts. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's family all smoked opium and he did not want his daughter. If they wanted to settle, then they would have to give</p>
<p>Another Four Hundred: Yuan, etc. The judge ordered both parties to settle out of court. If they could not come to an agreement, they would be summoned again for further questioning.</p>
<p>Those Who Send Letters of Extortion</p>
<h3>Are Mostly Acquainted</h3>
<p>Lu A-Long's Situation is Good</p>
<p>Fu A-Fang Intends to Extort</p>
<p>Arrested and Found to be an Acquaintance</p>
<p>Resulting in a Sentence of Three Years</p>
<p>Lu A-Long, a resident of Ningbo, lives at No. 521 Dithway Road in Hongkou. His situation is good, which is why he is coveted by criminal gangs. Since the 27th of last month, he suddenly received several threatening letters demanding 3,000 yuan. They said that if he agreed, they would write the words</p>
<p>"Heaven Emperor, Earth Emperor": on a piece of paper and paste it on the front of his house. Someone would then come with a red piece of paper to negotiate. If he did not give the money, they would write</p>
<p>"Heaven Red, Earth Red": as an indication, so that they could take more drastic measures. Lu reported the letters to the Harbin Police Station, asking them to investigate, and on the 30th, he pasted</p>
<p>a Piece of Paper on the Front Door: with the words "Heaven Emperor, Earth Red" written on it. That day, the police chief sent detectives to wait near Lu's house all day, but there was no movement. In the evening, he received another letter from the bandits, saying that the indication was ambiguous and unclear, and that it should be corrected immediately. The next morning, he sent someone to re-paste the paper with the words "Heaven Emperor, Earth Emperor." The next morning, he again ordered his son-in-law, Shao Wenjiu, to go to the police station and lead the detectives to hide in a secluded place, waiting until</p>
<p>Nine O'Clock When a Person Arrived: holding two red pieces of paper and a letter. Shao immediately handed the person a package wrapped in black cloth, saying that it contained 500 yuan in banknotes. The person received it and was about to leave when he was apprehended by undercover Chinese detectives Yan Aqing and Sun Yunqing. They opened the package and saw that it was full of waste paper. They took him back to the police station. According to the person, his name is Fan Nianyi, from Shaoxing, and he works as a waiter at the China Hotel at No. 91 Jiujiang Road. He was asked to pick it up by a tea server from the hotel,</p>
<p>Gu Zhaolin from Chongming: The detectives then arrested Gu, but Gu claimed that he was asked by two guests, surnamed Wang and Fu, who were staying in room 46 to pick up a package from that location. Because he was busy, he asked Fan to do it. At the time, the Wang person, who was staying in room 46, had already left.</p>
<p>Only One Fu A-Fang was Apprehended: Fu is also from Shaoxing. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Special District Local Court along with Fan, Gu, and the letters, slips of paper, package, and other evidence. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. Lu A-Long first explained the situation and said that he knew Fu A-Fang and that he had been to his house. He had never met Fan and Gu before. When questioned, Fu A-Fang completely attributed the idea to the Wang person who was on the run. Fan and Gu both claimed that they did not know anything about it beforehand. Judge Feng verified the testimony and found that</p>
<p>Fan and Gu Were Not Involved: He ordered their unconditional release. Fu A-Fang was sentenced to three years in prison. The threatening letters and red paper were confiscated.</p>

<p>Da Yaoxian's</p>
<h3>Defense Against the Police's Accusations of Illegality</h3>
<p>Letter to the Bar Association</p>
<p>Lawyer Da Yaoxian, who handled the Wang Desheng case, was accused by the police lawyer of exceeding his authority and instigating a confession. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, lawyer Da has sent a letter to the Bar Association, stating the truth of the matter because the facts were not entirely consistent. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, when our member was performing his duties, he was accused of "illegal behavior" by the police lawyer Wang Yaotang. The details of the matter are listed below. Wang Desheng was sued by the Huisi Police Station in the Shanghai Special District Local Court for the Zhou Dingwen threatening letter case. The second court date was May 31st in the morning. Our member, having been appointed by Wang Desheng's wife, as is customary, inquired about the details of the case to the parties involved. He contacted the police station to inquire about this matter. At 9:30, the police lawyer and the police chief had not yet arrived. Our member, needing to file a complaint, was concerned that it would be too late if he delayed any further. Therefore, he presented Wang Wang's letter of appointment to the Chinese police officer in charge of the waiting room and asked to see his client, Wang Desheng. He inquired about the details of the case and asked him to sign the letter of appointment. Later, at the request of the family, Wang Wang, he asked him, "Have you suffered?" Wang Desheng heard this, and tears streamed down his face. He cried and said that he had been interrogated and tortured by the police for more than five times, forcing him to admit to the items written on the confession, which were in fact written by them and did not conform to the facts. He was also accused of other crimes that he had never even heard of. He owns a shop and has always contracted with major merchants for various paint works and does not have time to deal with other matters. He also said that this time he was falsely accused because his friend Mao Qingde, nicknamed San Mapis, was a matchmaker and had a feud, colluding with the police to fabricate this unfortunate false accusation, etc. Our member, believing in justice and protecting the interests of the parties involved, instructed him to tell the judge the truth during the interrogation and not to suffer under duress and falsely confess to untrue matters that would harm himself. The judge should also make a judgment based on his own confession. You should choose between the death penalty and torture. When our member spoke, he spoke loudly and clearly. Not only was the Chinese police officer in charge present, but other defendants being held were also present, which can be used as evidence. Unexpectedly, the police officers who handled the case knew about it and were jealous, adding and subtracting facts and reporting them to the police lawyer Wang Yaotang of the case. Lawyer Wang then publicly accused our member of "illegal behavior." Our member responded that the police representative had not arrived in court by 9:30, and that he had asked the police officer in charge to see his client with a letter of appointment. This was a last resort. Now, in order to protect the interests of his client, the lawyer could guide him to tell the truth. If Wang Desheng had been tortured and forced to confess falsely by the police, he should tell the judge about it. Our client's life must not be sacrificed for the police's trap and cannibalistic tactics to gain promotion, etc. Later, during the interrogation, Lawyer Wang first told Judge Sun Yuan about our member's "illegal behavior" and cited Chinese police officers No. 245 and No. 818 to describe the matter, including falsely accusing our member of claiming to have obtained permission from the police to enter and instigating a counter-confession. Judge Sun then approved "Reschedule the interrogation of the concealment of crime part to next Saturday morning and send it to the prosecutor for investigation." The above is the details of the matter. According to our member, he accepted the case of the parties involved for a public fee of 100 yuan. Regardless of the truth of the accused facts, it is customary to inquire about the confession and to persuade the parties involved to make a truthful confession. Moreover, he spoke loudly and clearly in public, with everyone watching. He was then envied by the police officers for questioning, torturing, and forcing a confession, and the lawyer was accused of the strange thing of concealing a crime. In fact, the party involved, Wang Desheng, had denied all the facts in the first interrogation, which can be found in the records and newspapers. Our member's life, honor, and disgrace are not worth mentioning, but it is also too insulting to the authority of our colleagues in the legal profession. Since returning to the country, our member has served as a lawyer in the temporary court of the former Mixed Court for many years. He has also seen the foreign forces of the past doing things against the trend. However, he has never seen any shocking strange phenomena. At a time when the courts are being taken back, there are various unfortunate facts that are unexpected disasters. Because this matter concerns the authority of all our colleagues, please send a committee to investigate the facts and make a legal claim. Thank you very much. To the Shanghai Bar Association Executive Committee, Member Da Yaoxian. June 2nd, 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Response to the Accusation of Zheng Fuyu</h3>
<p>Yesterday, former oppressed officials and staff of the Changlu Customs Bureau sent a letter to this newspaper, saying, "In the local news column of your newspaper on the 2nd of this month, there was a report about the former Salt Transport Deputy Envoy being blackmailed by his subordinates. This is not in accordance with the facts. Zhang Tianji was appointed as the Director of the Changlu Customs Bureau in July of the 17th year, not the Salt Transport Deputy Envoy. Because he embezzled 1,484.64 yuan of private case rewards, he refused to issue them under various pretexts. The staff and officials were unwilling to give up and repeatedly requested without success. They then submitted a request to the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry of Finance to strictly order the issuance. It was approved, and all the facts of Zhang Tianji's illegal embezzlement and dereliction of duty during his tenure were listed to various officials to expose his bad deeds. Zhang knew that Zheng Fuyu, the director of the document section, was aware of all the evidence of his malpractice. He initially asked old friend Lu Xiquan to mediate, ostensibly promising to issue a portion of the private case rewards first, in order to lure the evidence of his malpractice. On the one hand, he framed and falsely accused Zheng in the police station, in order to carry out his conspiracy to strike first. In addition to hiring a lawyer to sue according to law, we are afraid of confusing the hearing, so we have prepared a letter to inform you."</p>

<h3>Disturbances in the Hometown Association</h3>
<p>The First and Second Elementary Schools established by the Shaoxing Hometown Association: Since Principal Luo of the First School was arrested in a case, the teachers launched a support association and led the students to raise donations along the road. The school board of the association tried to stop it, and the teachers were greatly dissatisfied. Yesterday, they incited the students and gathered many thugs, swarming to the Hometown Association, opening the iron gates and breaking the glass windows with stones, claiming to overthrow the Hometown Association.

<h3>Why Go to a Hotel to Discuss Marriage?</h3>
<p>Cai Huilong Clearly Had Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>Sentenced to One Month in Prison, Allowed to Redeem the Sentence</p>
<p>Zhou Lu, a woman who lives near Tangjiawan in the French Concession, has a nineteen-year-old daughter, Zhou Jinxiu, who works in a sock factory. A male employee of the factory, Cai Huilong, enticed her to a hotel and intended to commit illegal acts. The woman's brother learned about it and reported it to the police station, ordering detectives to go and arrest Cai and Jinxiu together. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for questioning. The plaintiff, the woman's mother, Zhou Lu, complained about the situation. When questioned, Cai Huilong said that he and Zhou Jinxiu worked in the same factory. Jinxiu voluntarily wanted to marry him, so he asked her to go to the hotel to discuss the matter of marriage. He had no intention of committing adultery. He was accidentally seen by a co-worker, who told the plaintiff and reported it to the police. However, he usually talked to Jinxiu often at the factory, which caused jealousy among other co-workers. He asked for leniency. When Zhou Jinxiu was questioned, her confession was similar. Judge Zhu Cheng told the defendant, Cai Huilong, that if you want to know about marriage, it is a legitimate thing and there is no need to go to a hotel to discuss it. It is clear that you had bad intentions. Cai was sentenced to one month in prison and allowed to redeem his sentence.</p>
<p>Xie Zhaoxian's</p>
<h3>Friend Proves Xie Has Lost His Job</h3>
<p>Willing to Pay His Rent</p>
<p>Unwilling to Pay Alimony</p>
<p>Xie Zhaoxian, from Guangdong (previously reported as Xie Guixian), rented a two-story house at No. 905 Weihai Lane, Weihai Road, after taking a concubine, as a place to hide his mistress, treating his first wife, Liang Lianzhi, as a stranger. The woman hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court, demanding to live together and claiming 950 yuan in alimony arrears for 19 months. The hearing has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the date for the continued hearing arrived, and the defendant was still not present. His fellow villager, Wu, came to court to testify, saying that the house in Weihai Lane had been transferred to him by Xie, and Xie still lived in the house. He is now unemployed, and he is paying the monthly rent out of friendship. He is in the import and export business, earning 7,000 to 8,000 yuan each year, or at least 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Xie's expenses are very low, only about 18 yuan per month. Judge Zhou Daren said to him, "Since you and Xie Zhaoxian are friends, fellow villagers, and neighbors, and you often pay his rent, your friendship is certainly more than ordinary. Now his wife is suing for 950 yuan in alimony, which is not a huge amount. You have ample financial resources. Why not act generously and pay it temporarily to avoid the couple's litigation and reunite the family? Wouldn't the couple be even more grateful?" But Wu shook his head repeatedly and said that he came here to prove the rental matter and could not act as a mediator. Then the debate began. The defendant's lawyer, on the grounds that the defendant was now unemployed and unable to provide, requested that the alimony lawsuit be dismissed. As for living together, he said that the defendant was welcome, but the plaintiff must be able to live frugally. He then stated that the defendant would file a counterclaim because the plaintiff had taken away valuables worth more than 4,000 yuan. Judge Zhou said that since the defendant had not filed a complaint or paid the court fees, the counterclaim should not be discussed for the time being. The plaintiff's lawyer then responded, attacking the testimony of witness Wu. After the arguments were completed, Judge Zhou announced that the verdict would be announced on the morning of June 5th.</p>
<h3>Husband is a Soldier, Wife Runs Away with Another Man</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, They Meet in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yu Zhaofu, from Shaoxing, is a soldier in the First Division of the National Revolutionary Army. He injured his leg on the front lines and was discharged. Yu left home to join the army in the 16th year of the Republic of China, leaving his wife, Li Mao, to guard the fields. However, the husband was a soldier, and the wife could not bear the emptiness. In January of this year, she secretly fled to Shanghai with a fellow villager, Chen Meilao, and lived in hiding in Zhiziyuan Road, North Station, living as a married couple. Yu took the opportunity to be discharged after being injured and returned home, but his wife had fled. He was extremely disappointed and returned to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he met his wife at the North Station. He immediately grabbed her and asked her why she was there. He learned that Chen Meilao had enticed her away. He also grabbed Chen and called the police, taking them to the Second Precinct of the Fifth District. Yesterday, they were sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Pregnant Woman Injured, Miscarriage</h3>
<p>Little Sanzi's Siblings are Detestable</p>
<p>Damaging the Bamboo Door Causes This Disaster</p>
<p>Liu Hanqing, 21 years old, from Yancheng, who lives at No. 1, Lane 1952, Zhoujiaqiao in the western suburbs of Shanghai, works for Rongmao Timber Factory for a living. His wife, Lin, is twenty years old, has been married for more than a year, and is pregnant, reaching six months. Around 9 o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, she was out shopping when she had an argument with Wang Er's sister, Little Sanzi, who was from the same hometown. The onlookers persuaded them to disperse. However, Little Sanzi was still unwilling and planned to retaliate. Later, she and her brother, A-San, pretended to fight outside the bamboo fence of the woman's residence. The woman was afraid of being disturbed and closed the bamboo door. The two continued to fight, deliberately knocking down the bamboo door. The door suddenly fell and hit the woman. The two saw that they had caused trouble and fled. At 12 o'clock, her husband returned home from the factory, and the woman told him that her abdomen felt a little painful. Liu did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, at around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the woman felt excruciating abdominal pain and gave birth prematurely to twins, who were injured and died. Liu reported to the Sixth District Substation, and Inspector Wei sent police to investigate and found the facts to be true. Because the defendants, Wang Er and Little Sanzi, had fled, their brother, A-San, and Little Sanzi were arrested and transferred to the Sixth District Police Station. After interrogation by the District Chief Ren, the case was related to intentionally harming a pregnant woman, resulting in a miscarriage, which belonged to the criminal scope. He immediately sent police to summon Wang Er and Little Sanzi to the station and prepared a document yesterday to send them to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Eight-Year-Old Girl as a Child Bride</h3>
<p>Biological Mother Unhappy for Five Yuan</p>
<p>The Couple Almost Came to Blows</p>
<p>Sun Liyuan, from Zhenjiang, who lives in Caojiadu in the western suburbs of Shanghai, runs a small business. There are many mouths to feed in his family, including his wife, Sun Qi, for a total of six. In this era of expensive rice and firewood, it costs no less than one yuan a day to eat enough, and life is very worrying. He plans to reduce the number of mouths to feed, so he entrusted his neighbor, Yu Gunong, as a matchmaker to marry his eight-year-old daughter, Yatou, as a child bride to Li Chengming's family. She was brought into the family on the 29th of last month. At that time, the bride price was agreed upon as 40 yuan, but Sun Qi only received 5 yuan to buy clothes. She was very unhappy because she was only enjoying 5 yuan for being pregnant for ten months. Yesterday, she went to Li's house to take the person back. Li refused. The woman twisted Yu Gunong to the Sixth District Police Station to accuse him of selling her daughter and defrauding her of money. The police station summoned Sun Liyuan, who claimed that he was willing to give his daughter away as a child bride and that he had received the full amount of money. He pointed to the clothes on the woman's body and said, "Where did they come from? She has no conscience." The couple almost came to blows. The police station transferred them to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Collapsed Cart Driver Dies En Route</h3>
<p>A certain Mr. Jia, a cart puller, approximately forty to fifty years old, fell ill at the intersection of Haining Road at 8:30 PM last night, on the verge of death.

<h3>Passenger Jumps into River Midstream</h3>
<p>Accused of Theft, Ordered to Compensate</p>
<p>Unable to Raise Funds, Driven to Despair</p>
<p>The No. 9 ferry owned by Zhou A’gen, which operates between the Puxi Customs Wharf and the Pudong Chunjiang Wharf, was loading passengers at the Puxi Wharf yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, heading back to Pudong. As the boat reached the center of the river, a hawker selling Rendan (a type of medicine) began to call out his wares. At the same time, a young passenger offered to buy some. Just as the transaction was taking place, the passenger suddenly threw down his white straw hat and jumped into the river, intending to commit suicide. After sinking, he resurfaced briefly, but before a rescue could be mounted, he was lost to the bottom of the river, never to resurface. Afterwards, the boatman sent the deceased's two companions and the abandoned straw hat to the Customs River Police. According to the two companions, one named Bian Jinbao and the other Zhang Jisheng, the deceased was their friend, named Liu Xi, from Jiujiang, twenty-seven years old, with no permanent employment. He lived at No. 13 Haixing Road in Pudong, and his wife worked at the Rihua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui. They heard that Liu had gone to visit a friend surnamed Wang in Desheng Lane, Haixing Road, the day before yesterday. Afterwards, the Wang family discovered the theft of two gold rings, a gold hairpin, and a child's bracelet. They accused Liu of the theft, so they asked someone surnamed He from Xiangfen Lane to negotiate. Liu was asked to compensate the Wang family thirty yuan in silver dollars to settle the matter. This suicide was likely due to his inability to raise the funds to pay the compensation. The police chief verified the statement and ordered that the person surnamed He, who acted as mediator, be brought to the police station for further investigation.</p>

Inspector Xu asked if she had any intentions, but she seemed unsure of what to say and did not dare to ask the court for compensation, only stating that her husband’s death was very tragic and she wished to claim the body. Inspector Xu ruled that the deceased, Yang Wencai, had indeed died from falling while working. According to the wife's statement, she requested to collect the body for burial and had no other requests. This was approved.</p>

<h3>Mao Genyang Wounds Wife in Abdomen with Knife</h3>
<p>Was it Intentional Injury?</p>
<p>The Injured Party's Statement Will Be Taken</p>
<p>Mao Genyang, a Ningbo native who sells beef at a stall in the Huade Road market, owed his sister, Ge Mao, money. The day before the Dragon Boat Festival, his sister ordered her brother, Quanyang, to collect the debt and demand high interest. Genyang was furious. After closing his stall, at 6:30 PM in the evening, he intended to go to his sister's house to argue, but his wife, Zhong, tried to stop him. In the ensuing commotion, Mrs. Zhong's waist was injured by the sharp knife used for cutting beef, causing profuse bleeding. The Huishan Police were notified and sent detectives to rush to the scene. They took Mrs. Zhong to Guangren Hospital for treatment and detained Genyang. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court and charged with assault. Mrs. Zhong's injury was severe, posing a threat to her life, so she could not appear in court. Her son, Mao Qianchang, brother, Mao Quanyang, and Mrs. Zhong's sister, Zhong Caifeng, were all summoned to court. Regarding whether Mao Genyang intended to harm his wife, they all said they did not know. Genyang claimed that his wife held him and did not allow him to go to his sister's house. He wanted to break free, causing him to knock against the knife on the refrigerator, which fell and injured his wife's waist. He added that his wife did not cry out in pain at the time, so he did not pay attention. He only learned of the arrest when he returned from his sister's house. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and to wait for a statement from the injured party from the hospital before further verification.</p>
<h3>Worker Zhang Jinkui Electrocuted to Death</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>Zhang Jinkui, a tire-fitting worker at the Shanghai South Public Bus Company garage, was using a motor pump supplied by the Asiatic Petroleum Company to inflate tires at 6:00 AM on May 19th when he was suddenly electrocuted and fainted. Driver Chen Jinrong saw him and rushed him to Southeast Hospital for an injection before transferring him to Shanghai Hospital. However, he died due to prolonged exposure to electricity. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate and took the faulty air compressor to the bureau for inspection. It was found that its insulation was above 220,000 ohms, which met the required standard. How the worker was electrocuted to death at the time could not be determined after the fact. However, the garage's electrical equipment was deemed to have some deficiencies that needed to be rectified for safety. It is reported that the bureau will soon send personnel to the garage to inspect its electrical equipment and supervise the improvements. The company has already been instructed to take note of this matter.</p>
<p>Motorcycle Daredevils</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of Competition</h3>
<p>Second Competition This Thursday</p>
<p>Added Amateur Chinese Program</p>
<p>The arrival of eleven members of the world motorcycle daredevil team in Shanghai has been repeatedly reported. The opening night was held the night before last at the cinder track specially built in Shen Garden. Thousands of spectators attended, a grand and bustling scene. The eight programs that evening were all interesting and worth watching. The racers sped by like lightning, leaning inward at the corners, using physics to vie for the lead. This skill was particularly commendable, and their spirit of courage and adventure matched the term "daredevil team." The audience was both thrilled and applauded, exclaiming at the incredible skill. The second competition will be held this Thursday (the 5th) starting at 9:15 PM. In addition to the performance by the eleven experts from the touring team, several amateur programs for Chinese and Westerners will be added to increase interest. Winners of this amateur competition will be awarded silver cups, silver shields, and other prizes as encouragement. There have been many Westerners signing up, and Chinese are also not lacking.

<h3>Lawsuit Over Copyright of Modern Novel Selection</h3>
<p>Asia &amp; Co. and Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Had Reached a Settlement But Each Unwilling to Yield</p>
<p>Now the Plaintiff Must Provide Evidence</p>
<p>Asia &amp; Co. collected the best of modern novels and compiled them into a volume entitled "Selection of Modern Chinese Novels," which was printed and sold. Six other publishers, including Kaiming Bookstore, sued Asia &amp; Co. for copyright infringement. The Special District Local Court previously summoned the parties for trial. The defendant engaged lawyers Jiang Rong and Xu Shihao to defend them. The court ordered them to settle out of court, but neither party was willing to give ground, and the settlement failed. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang continued the trial. The plaintiff's lawyers argued that the plaintiff had already applied for registration of the published works and had obtained copyright. The defendant's lawyers argued that although the plaintiff had applied for registration, it was not yet clear whether it had been approved. Therefore, the plaintiff could not bring a lawsuit against others. The case should first be decided on whether the plaintiff could file a lawsuit. Furthermore, there was no sufficient evidence of the copyright prior to applying for registration. Therefore, even if the plaintiff's books had been registered, the procedure was improper, not to mention that it was still uncertain whether it had been approved. Each side held its ground and argued. Judge Yang ordered the plaintiff to present evidence of registration and adjourned the trial for another day.</p>
<h3>Sorrowful Passing of Dr. Shih Fei-pi</h3>
<p>Dr. Shih Fei-pi was originally from Huangmei County, Hubei Province. She was the third sister of Dr. Shih Mei-yu, from a prominent family with a long tradition of scholarship. Her father founded the Jiujiang Christian Church. Dr. Shih received her early education from her mother and then entered the Jiujiang Ruli Girls' School. She graduated at the age of eighteen and went to the American Gaoqiao Women's University, where she graduated with the best academic record, ranking first. The school awarded her a scholarship for the most outstanding achievement to continue her medical studies at Johns Hopkins University, where she received her Doctor of Medicine degree. She then interned at Worcester City Hospital. In 1919, she returned to China and was hired as the director of the Jiujiang Maternity and Children's Hospital. In 1920, she came to Shanghai with her sister, Mei-yu, and founded the Bethel Hospital and nursing and obstetrics schools. She began practicing medicine in Shanghai and, within a year, her reputation grew significantly. Thousands of people from far and wide sought medical treatment from her each year, and hundreds of students sought admission to her schools. Dr. Shih did not spare her efforts, seeing patients day and night. Regardless of their wealth or social status, she treated them with dedication once she was consulted. She taught her students, whether they were intelligent or dull, with kindness and guidance. She worked so diligently for seven years, performing five to six deliveries and making four to five house calls every day. In addition to her dozens of outpatient visits and seeing patients at Bethel Hospital, she personally taught her students, tirelessly imparting knowledge. She never ate on time. As a result, she was exhausted. In 1926, she went to Europe for treatment, but her condition did not improve. She returned to China in 1927 and then went to Korea for recuperation, but her illness was too severe and incurable. Her body had been ailing for four years and never fully recovered. She finally passed away at 2:00 PM on May 29th of this year. Dr. Shih was known for her kindness and never sought fame or fortune. She died at the young age of forty. Her funeral was held at Bethel Hospital at 2:00 PM last Saturday, and she was buried at the Hongqiao Road International Cemetery at 5:00 PM. Important figures such as Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Minister Kong and his wife, and Minister Song and his wife all sent wreaths. Medical professionals such as Niu Huilin and his wife personally attended the funeral. More than a thousand people from all walks of life attended the funeral.</p>
<h3>Reply Regarding Pigment Industry Contract Case</h3>
<p>The pigment department of the German firm Lihe Foreign Firm in this city and Ma Shangjie, the owner of Shangda Pigment Company, a member of the Pigment and Indigo Industry Association, entered into a goods contract (for lake-colored pigment). Due to the sharp decline in the gold pound, disputes arose, attracting the attention of the entire pigment industry and society in general, as reported in this newspaper. The case was referred by Yang Yi, Judge of the Civil Court of the Special District Court, to the Pigment Industry Association for mediation. After receiving the order, the association sent a letter to the firm, setting the date of the 28th of last month for the firm to send a responsible representative to attend the mediation. Subsequently, the firm replied by letter refusing, showing contempt for the dignity of our country's judiciary, which caused great indignation. The association submitted a reply to the Special District Court, stating: "Regarding the reply of the association, on the 26th of last month, Yang, Judge of the Civil Court of your court, ordered that the case of a dispute between Ma Shangjie of Shangda Pigment Company, a member of our association, and Lihe Foreign Firm regarding a goods contract, be mediated by our association by summoning both parties involved. After receiving this order, our association sent a letter to Lihe Foreign Firm requesting them to send a responsible representative to attend the meeting on the 28th of the same month for mediation. Subsequently, the firm replied by letter refusing, clearly violating the order of the judge of your court, showing contempt for the dignity of our country's judiciary. The main points of the original dispute can be summarized as follows: (1) The method of Lihe Foreign Firm, due to the sharp decline in the gold pound, intends to default on the goods, displaying the imperialist firm's reliance on power to undermine our country's weak commerce, fabricating deceptive arguments, and lacking genuine reasons for the dispute. (2) On the side of Ma Shangjie, the goods contract signed with the firm should be performed based on material evidence according to legal, customary, and commercial practices, which is verifiable. There is no precedent for requiring additional written documents beyond the original evidence. The plaintiff and defendant have been trading goods for more than ten years without any such illegal practice. Furthermore, the pigment industry in this city has never heard of such an eccentric and perverse custom. Taking a step back, even if the contract contains English records, it is as if this type of contract between Chinese and foreigners is a mere formality. Questioned in this way, Lihe Foreign Firm would likely be speechless and unable to justify itself, contradicting itself and revealing flaws. If, unfortunately, they are allowed to proceed with their deception, and this precedent is set, it will cause major disputes in society and the judiciary, and the future of Chinese merchants will be in great danger. Furthermore, after this case occurred, not only did the pigment industry in the city, whose interests were directly affected, rise up in anger, but public opinion was also unusually agitated. The association's concern for the interests of its members is minor compared to the harm caused by the taking and discarding of contracts between Chinese and foreigners throughout Shanghai and China, undermining our country's commercial rights. Our association feels a lump in its throat and cannot remain silent, and dares to appeal and submit this reply, hoping that the court will consider the law, commercial practices, and carefully review the facts, illuminating the truth and eliminating the evil. We also ask that this be forwarded to Judge Yang Yi to make a ruling in accordance with the law, so as to uphold the judiciary and protect national rights. We are extremely grateful."</p>

<p>A certain French woman residing in the Wangjiazai Garden had been suffering from a nervous disorder. Two weeks ago, she attempted suicide by drinking spirits and was sent by her family to Baolong Hospital on Baike Road for treatment, where she was placed in room 304 on the third floor. Unfortunately, her illness was deep-seated and showed no signs of improvement. Yesterday morning, her maid brought her breakfast, which she reluctantly ate. After a while, her mother came to the hospital to visit her. They talked for about an hour until around 10:00 AM, when her mother left. About ten minutes later, the woman suddenly changed her demeanor, sat up in bed, walked to the window, opened it, and jumped out towards the courtyard. People noticed, but it was already too late to save her. Her mother was informed and rushed to the hospital, but the woman had already passed away. She cradled her lifeless body and wept loudly, touching the hearts of all who heard. The deceased was about twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old. Her parents visited her every day, often three or four times.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Edison Factory Strike</h3>
<p>Full Resumption of Work Expected Today</p>
<p>Some Workers Entered Factory Yesterday</p>
<p>The strike by workers at the General Electric Edison bulb factory on Roberts Road in western Shanghai, in protest against the factory's dismissal of workers and demanding improved treatment, has lasted for a week. Through the efforts of Party, government, and police agencies to mediate between labor and management, progress has been smooth. The factory informed all workers a few days ago that they should return to work starting yesterday. A portion of the workers entered the factory at around 7:00 AM. Beforehand, Ren Lupiing, the district chief of the Caogadu 6th District Public Security Bureau, ordered all police officers to take good care of the factory vicinity and maintain order. All went well. At lunchtime, there was a disturbance among the female workers, but it was quickly resolved with the care of the police officers. District Chief Ren, along with representatives from the Party headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, personally persuaded and comforted the workers. The workers agreed to resume work in full starting today. The labor union issued a notice to the workers, instructing them to enter the factory together at 10:00 AM this morning. All pending conditions will be addressed by Party, government, and police officials in negotiations with the factory. Therefore, the Edison factory workers are expected to resume work in full today.</p>

If the price of gold continues to rise, the executive committee will meet again to discuss raising prices further.</p>
<h3>Lost Girl Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that a lost girl was sent from the 5th district yesterday. When asked about her age, origin, and family situation, she was too young to state.

The child has been temporarily sent to Xinpu Hall to wait for her family to claim her.</p>
<h3>Fresh Meat Industry Association Reorganization Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association held its third reorganization committee meeting yesterday at the Xiangxue Hall of the Yuyuan Garden at the City God Temple. Huang Yexin was elected chairman, and the proceedings followed the established protocol. The following resolutions were made: (1) All properties and contracts of the Xiangxue Hall and Chengren Hall will continue to be managed by the original handlers during the reorganization period. However, detailed accounts of all amounts must be opened and reported at the next meeting. (2) Recruitment of members is limited to before June 15th. All must be completed. Staff will be hired separately by the Trade Union Xiangxue Hall and Chengren Hall. Fellow merchants from the British and French concessions will be recruited by Rong Qianchu, Huang Yexin, and Sun Huangcong. (3) For the market shutdown in Pudong, the two standing representatives Huang Yexin and Shen Xie will be instructed to discuss with the reorganization committee to request upper-level concern for the difficulties of the merchants and to build a slaughterhouse at a suitable location. Until it is completed, they will be allowed to operate as usual. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>Continued Rise in Intestinal Market Prices</h3>
<p>Chinese livestock intestines (i.e., pig and sheep small intestines) are exported to Europe and America and are a major export commodity. The raw materials, in addition to those from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, are mostly produced in northern Anhui and southern Henan. Therefore, large factories such as Lishunji have established branches there to produce semi-finished products, which are then shipped to Shanghai for reprocessing and then exported to Europe and America. The current value of gold is soaring, and foreign merchants are calculating that it is profitable. Yihua and other firms have been sending telegrams to procure goods. Therefore, the price of first-class spot goods has risen by three to four cents per pair. However, the inventory in Shanghai is low, and there is a market but no goods. The goods from Anhui and Henan cannot be shipped to Shanghai due to the impact of the war. Therefore, the market price is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued the following weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: The sky is cloudy, indicating a change. The south wind in Shandong is light and very undirected. A low-pressure system is approaching the Sea of Japan, followed by a high-pressure system that will cause a strong northwest wind in Korea and the Bohai Sea area. The highest temperature in this city in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 90.0 degrees, and the lowest was 68.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 88.3 degrees and the lowest was 55.0 degrees.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>"Dear Editor: According to a letter from the party concerned, Mr. Bao Guancheng, I have read the news in your newspaper on the 22nd of this month, 'Investigation of Impersonation of Northeast Representative Bao Guancheng'. I am extremely shocked. After checking, Guancheng has not been assigned to be a representative of the Northeast, nor has he ever visited a certain dean in Beijing or Tianjin. It is obvious that the report is based on false rumours. I hereby entrust you to handle the matter and request that you make corrections. Yours sincerely, Attorney Jiang Yiping, May 31, 1930"</p>

<h3>Special Issue Commemorating the Anti-Opium Campaign, Edited by the Anti-Opium Committee</h3>
<h3>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Instructions Regarding the Prohibition of Opium</h3>
<p>"The business of opium absolutely cannot coexist with the national government that has the power granted by the people. The will of the Chinese people is to oppose opium. Anyone who advocates allowing the business of opium by law, or who expresses submission to the evil forces of opium, is a public enemy of the people. The war against opium must absolutely not be compromised. If the responsible government agency lowers its flag and ceases fighting opium for its own private convenience, even temporarily, it is an act of treason. To achieve the goal of opium prohibition, a nationally consistent plan that is followed by all must be adopted by the national government. However, before the warlords are overthrown and the civil government can unify the country, anti-opium organizations must persevere and not abandon the determination to fight with perseverance and without compromise, and must always adopt a thorough and uncompromising policy."</p>
<h3>Introduction by Zhang Zhijiang</h3>
<p>This special issue is dedicated to the gracious words and valuable insights provided by comrades of the Party and the Nation. These contributions greatly benefit the people and are of significant value. On behalf of the Anti-Smoking Committee, I extend our deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>The work of banning opium relies on two critical areas. On the one hand, the government must diligently enforce the prohibition. On the other hand, the public must awaken and voluntarily quit. Only through the cooperation of both sides can we hope to achieve complete success. In the past, when asked about the results of the ban, government agencies were, of course, deeply ashamed. However, aside from the enthusiastic efforts of anti-drug organizations, the majority of the public seemed to remain in a dream. How heartbreaking and painful this is. Yet, it is not surprising. According to the principle that practice is easy, but knowledge is difficult, the public does not yet understand. How can we blame them for not practicing?</p>
<p>June 3rd - Discipline</p>
<p>Continuing the Spirit of June 3rd to Thoroughly Eliminate the Scourge of Opium</p>
<p>He Yingqin</p>
<p>The work of the Anti-Smoking Committee, in addition to supervising the implementation of the ban by the provincial and municipal governments in accordance with the law, includes the important task of publicity. The publication of this special issue on Discipline Day is one aspect of this publicity effort. It is hoped that prominent individuals across the country will offer guidance on the progress of this work, and that insightful and significant articles will continue to flow in. These contributions will be compiled into a volume and distributed among the people. I also represent the people in thanking you for your generosity.</p>
<h3>Inscription for the Special Anti-Smoking Issue by Wang Chonghui</h3>
<p>The Anti-Smoking Committee has published a special issue on June 3rd Discipline Day to expand publicity and raise national awareness. When asked for my thoughts, I believe that the harm of opium has a long history. Before the Yuan and Ming dynasties, it was regarded as a precious product for nourishing life and stopping disease. However, it was only used as a medicine, unlike later generations when addiction became prevalent and poisoned society. By the early Qing Dynasty, its harm gradually spread. During the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns, prohibitions were issued. During the Daoguang reign, Mr. Lin Zexu recognized the harm of opium and requested a strict ban. He seized and destroyed opium that British merchants had brought. The British used this as a pretext for war. The Qing government’s response was ill-conceived. Mr. Lin was severely punished, leading to the Treaty of Nanjing and the loss of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>The poison of opium is hotter than fire and deeper than water. It destroys your industry, wastes your time, and must be resisted with determination. The foundation of national salvation lies in this prohibition.</p>
<p>Inscription by Xu Shiying</p>
<p>The situation has never recovered and the nation has fallen as a result. The scourge of opium has become even more severe. The National Government has established its capital in Nanjing, and has specifically set up the Anti-Smoking Committee to handle the matter. June 3rd has been designated as a day of commemoration. Now the government has shown determination to govern diligently and start anew, and has strictly laid out regulations. The eradication of the scourge of opium lies in the resolute actions of the entire nation. While enforcing the law and eliminating harm is the responsibility of the government, summoning courage and striving for strength lies in the self-awareness and revitalization of the national spirit. The active publicity efforts of social organizations will not only be highly effective, but also lead to swift success. What is past cannot be changed, but what is to come can still be pursued. I am willing to encourage this together with the people.</p>
<h3>Future Paths for Implementing the Opium Ban</h3>
<p>Wang Boqun</p>
<p>Tracing the harm of opium in our country, it spans hundreds of years. In recent times, its poison has become increasingly severe, surpassing the calamities of war and epidemic disease. When considering the reasons for our nation's long-term weakness, the harm caused by opium is the greatest. For over a decade, the orders banning opium have been quite strict, and the anti-drug movement has been quite vigorous. However, the scourge of opium has increased rather than decreased year after year. Not only are sales openly conducted in the inland provinces, with opium addicts used as a source of profit, but major cities also harbor filth and accept dirt, treating the ban as a mere formality. Despite the government's repeated orders and</p>
<p>The poison of opium is indeed a form of imperialism bewitching China, humiliating the Yellow Race, and causing us to stoop. We must bravely extricate ourselves, become angry, and strive for self-improvement to reverse the decline and wash away past humiliations.</p>
<p>Inscription for the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration by Jiao Chong</p>
<p>repeated instructions, opium users remain ignorant and oblivious. If this continues, our nation will be trapped in an irrecoverable state. When considering national construction, which is at its initial stage, the people should be working hard to produce in order to develop the people's livelihood. However, opium destroys the productive capacity of our nation, leading to poverty. At a time when foreign insults are becoming increasingly urgent, the people should be training their bodies to strengthen the race. However, opium destroys the vitality of our nation, leading to weakness. This is truly a great and pressing concern for the future of the nation. Thus, it is known that if the poison of opium is not eliminated, the politics will inevitably remain corrupt, and the Three Principles of the People can never be realized. Sun Yat-sen stated, "The business of opium absolutely cannot coexist with a national government endowed with power by the people." He also said, "The key to banning opium lies not only in prohibiting planting, but also in prohibiting sale." Wise words! To purify the poison of opium, we must rely on the combined efforts of the entire nation to achieve the complete implementation of the opium ban. On the one hand, we must seek the abolition of unequal treaties to cut off the source from foreign countries. On the other hand, we must vigorously implement opium ban measures, prohibiting planting, selling, and smoking simultaneously. Offenders should be punished severely and not simply fined, which would open the door to convenience. We must also strive to complete unification and develop transportation so that the scourge of opium in the inland provinces can be gradually eliminated. "Hopefully, this blood-sucking, fat-eating poison will be forever cut off from the Chinese nation. This is the responsibility of the association and the sincere prayer of the people across the nation, hoping to see it achieved.</p>
<p>Parting the Clouds to See the Sun by Jiang Menglin</p>
<h3>Inscription for the Special Anti-Smoking Commemoration Issue</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>There is no other method to banning opium, but determination. The government has already shown determination. If society can cooperate with determination and supervision, how can those who transport drugs escape the net? If the people can determinedly abstain from it, where can it be sold? So if the determination is shown it doesn't need to be said, it'll be banned. If the determination is not shown, although it is said every day, it will not be banned after all. On the Commemorative day for the Opium Ban, I dare to say this to the people of the country and hope they will think deeply about it.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Opium Ban by Zhang Wohua</h3>
<p>The Anti-Smoking Committee is publishing a special issue on the occasion of the upcoming June 3rd Commemoration to expand publicity. I, Wohua, have been asked to contribute my thoughts. I humbly quote:</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen stated that those who engage in the opium business are public enemies of the people and acts of treason. How magnificent are his words! We must uphold</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's teachings and deeply and strictly remember these words. If we do not jointly devise fundamental measures to completely eliminate the scourge of opium, how can we fulfill Sun Yat-sen's unfinished mission of eradicating opium? Since opium flowed into China, it has been more than a hundred years. It has harmed the nation and the people more than anything else. It has not only had a significant impact on the economy, but it has also weakened the race. The label of "sick man of East Asia" is largely due to this. Since the Republic of China, opium prohibition ordinances have been promulgated many times and have been vigorously enforced, but it has been repeated many times. Those who ban ban, but those who plant still plant. June 3rd Anti-Smoking Day Special Edition Title</p>
<p>Alas! Our compatriots are sinking into the darkness, unable to see the light of day.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bright star appears in the wilderness, illuminating the world, and evil spirits hide.</p>
<p>What is this bright star? It is the secret treasure of Hongwen, cleansing away filth and saving the masses.</p>
<p>The compassionate boat of the sea of suffering is a widespread salvation for the people. Guangzhou looks back and rallies its spirit.</p>
<p>Respectfully inscribed by Song Ziwen</p>
<p>Those who transport still transport, and those who sell and smoke still sell and smoke. Not only has the toxic atmosphere not been cleared, but it has also continued to grow and increase. The reason for this is that during the warlord era, while anti-smoking agencies were nominally established, they actually disregarded the laws and even encouraged the people to plant opium in order to extract illegal income. Some even ordered each county to plant a certain number of acres of opium seedlings, rewarding those who exceeded the quota and punishing those who fell short. The greed and dereliction of duty of those in power were like this. Moreover, treacherous merchants and local traffickers used the military and police as their protectors. Opium dens and opium transport businesses initially acted secretly, but then became openly unscrupulous. Dishonest officials colluded and divided the spoils, turning a blind eye. Even those who were truly serious about investigating and banning opium found themselves unable to act alone and dared not offend those in power. The disregard for the opium ban by those below was also like this. It is truly a great lament. However, these are the facts of the past. Now, the National Government has established an Anti-Smoking Committee, and all anti-smoking laws and regulations are thorough and comprehensive, needing no further elaboration. Banning opium requires four essential elements: prohibiting planting, transporting, selling, and smoking. Everyone knows this. Prohibiting planting, transporting, and selling are the most fundamental measures. If those who plant opium can be severely punished according to the law and the opium seedlings can be eradicated, and if those who transport and sell opium can be strictly searched and prevented from escaping the law, then the source will be cut off and the smoking addicts will naturally quit. It is hoped that the anti-smoking administrators and all anti-drug comrades across the country will be determined to eliminate evil, implement the National Government's opium prohibition policy, supervise anti-smoking officials in various places, and work hard. On the part of the people, those who are addicted should sincerely quit, and those who are not addicted should encourage each other to abstain, using their strong and resolute power to eliminate the scourge of opium, in order to realize</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's legacy of rejecting drugs. This is what Wohua sincerely prays for. In the past, Lin Wenqing, seeing the prevalence of the opium scourge, stated that if this scourge is not eliminated, China will have no usable soldiers or funds in a few decades. He then decisively punished corrupt officials who sheltered foreign and local opium merchants, and burned all the opium that the British merchants had imported. His noble spirit and heroic actions are still remembered today. We, as comrades, uphold the revolutionary spirit and embrace the concept of strengthening the race. Compared to our predecessors, how can we allow ourselves to be outdone? Let us eliminate the scourge of opium, and we will wait and see!</p>
<h3>On Commemorating Lin Zexu by Wang Weifan</h3>
<p>Two figures from non-revolutionary times are perpetually commemorated by the National Government: Confucius, whose birthday is August 27th, and Lin Zexu, who destroyed British opium on June 3rd. Confucius's vision of the Great Unity established the ultimate goal of the revolution, making commemoration appropriate. Lin Zexu was merely a Qing official. However, he was able to disregard personal gain and loss in a non-revolutionary environment and actively fight against imperialism and wage a deadly battle against opium. These actions serve as a model for our revolutionary comrades, inspiring feelings of shame for falling short. This is truly a model for our party comrades. This is the reason why the National Government designated the Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day. Although, over the past thousands of years, only Lin Zexu has been able to be placed alongside Confucius and receive such great importance in today's revolutionary era. Alas, Lin Zexu is truly honored!</p>
<h3>The Opium Ban Over the Past Year by Zhong Ketuo</h3>
<p>Time flies, and years pass quickly. This year's June 3rd Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day is a year away from last year's June 3rd 90th Anniversary of Lin Zexu's. In this past year, what has been the situation regarding the opium ban? This is something that the people of the country want to know, and I, serving in the anti-opium organization, am most happy to report. Today is the day of the publication of a special issue on the sixth and third anti-smoking commemoration, and I am not afraid to be wordy, and I will report to the elders, brothers, sisters and sisters all over the country.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's legacy of resisting drugs states: "There can be absolutely no compromise on the issue of opium." In the past year, although the committee's measures could not be fully implemented according to plan due to frequent military activities and a harsh environment, it still adhered to the spirit of drug resistance and did not dare to relax. Here are the most important aspects of the opium ban in the past year, covering nine things:</p>
<p>The poison of poppy is more poisonous than a collapsing river. The whole country is dying, raise your voice, wake up the stubborn, end the descendants, and save the whole.</p>
<p>（一） Regarding Opium Ban Policies: Last year, a timetable for work during the period of political tutelage was drafted. It detailed how the opium ban work should be allocated and carried out. It is still under review by the Central Political Council. Once approved, it will be implemented in an orderly manner. In addition, the rules for the implementation of the opium ban law stipulated that opium ban committees should be established in various provinces and cities, and inspection offices should be established at various important ports, all in order to eradicate the opium scourge as soon as possible and provide supervision. Although the organizational rules for the above items were drafted and sent to the court, due to the ongoing military activities and the limitation of the economy, the establishment is still slightly pending. However, the overall trend is inevitable.</p>
<p>（二） Regarding Opium Ban Laws and Regulations: There are more than ten items in total: （A） Opium Ban Law （B） Rules for the Implementation of the Opium Ban Law （C） Rules for the Verification of Public Servants （D） Regulations on the Performance Evaluation of Opium Ban （E） Regulations on the Inspection of Opium Seedlings by County Magistrates （F） Measures for Inspecting Ships, Vehicles, and Airplanes for Smuggling Opium （G） Regulations on the Establishment of Drug Rehabilitation Centers and Local Hospitals Handling Drug Rehabilitation Matters （H） Regulations on the Distribution of Opium Ban Fines （I） Measures for the June 3rd Opium Ban Commemoration Day （J） Simple Rules for Reviewing Accusation Documents. The above laws and regulations cover the prohibition of planting, transporting, selling, and smoking opium. Since their promulgation, they have gradually been put into practice. One example that can prove this is that the counties in western Fujian have always been opium-producing areas. Recently, Lin Shouguo, commander of the Marine Corps, together with the county magistrates, eradicated more than 10,000 acres of opium seedlings. From this, it can be seen that the formulation of opium ban laws and regulations has had a significant effect. （三） Regarding the Verification of Public Servants: Repeated requests have been sent to various agencies in the capital to reply. Verifications have been conducted separately. A total of eighty-eight people were suspected of smoking opium. They have been suspended from their posts at any time. Other provinces and cities have also handled them in order. The guarantees of the members are attached and sent to the meeting. Now, in order to eliminate malpractices, it is planned to conduct random checks and re-verifications in order to purify officialdom and set an example with the first name.</p>
<p>（四） Regarding Drug Rehabilitation Work: All provincial and municipal governments have now been notified to order the establishment of drug rehabilitation hospitals within a limited time, so that opium users can surrender themselves and be admitted to hospitals for drug rehabilitation, and show the government's intention to show mercy and not kill without teaching. It is expected that they will be established one after another in the shortest possible time. This is also good news for opium users. For the funds of the drug rehabilitation hospital, it is also stipulated that 20% of the fines will be used to cover it. Those who are found to have committed opium crimes must be sent to the hospital for drug rehabilitation before being convicted, because they are afraid that they will still have their addiction after they are released from prison. They have to plan a fundamental plan for removal, and also announce to the people that they must submit the collected opium paraphernalia within a limited time for collection and destruction, and make fundamental elimination.</p>
<p>（五） Regarding the Investigation of Opium Ban: Initially, members were sent to the three northeastern provinces, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and other provinces to investigate the opium ban situation in various places. The places where the work was neglected were corrected based on the reports. Then, members were sent to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places to investigate the situation of Japanese ruffians poisoning China and transporting narcotic drugs. After the evidence was collected, it was reported to the League of Nations and announced in Chinese and foreign newspapers, which has won the League of Nations' attention to China's determination to ban opium. An agreement to unanimously abide by the Hague Convention has now been passed. All of these have achieved the effects of the above-mentioned investigation. It is now planned to send special commissioners to the League of Nations to jointly study international opium issues in order to deal with them.</p>
<p>（六） Regarding the Assessment of Opium Administration in Various Provinces: Repeated requests have been sent to various provincial and municipal governments to conduct assessments in accordance with the provisions of the Opium Ban Performance Evaluation Regulations. Those who have approved the reports to the meeting have been rewarded and punished separately according to their performance, which is to reward the meritorious and warn the ineffective.</p>
<p>（七） Regarding Opium Cases and Accusation Cases: The opium case statistics have been published in detail in each issue of the gazette and need not be repeated. As for the accusation case statistics, there were more than 800 cases in total in the past year, of which more than 200 were more serious and more than 600 were less serious. As long as the accusation procedure is complete, it will not be rejected.</p>
<p>（八） Regarding International Aspects: It is now scheduled for the International Opium Ban Committee to hold a special meeting in August, and convene an international conference on restricting narcotic drugs in Geneva on December 1. It is closely related to China's opium ban issue and should be dealt with vigorously. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, Health, and Foreign Affairs are now preparing proposals to limit the output of industrial-grade narcotic drugs to the lowest possible extent. The League of Nations is also paying close attention to the use of medicines and drugs containing narcotic drugs, and has consulted with the Ministry of Health to take action in accordance with the regulations on medicines and drugs.</p>
<p>（九） Regarding the Cooperation of the Party, Government, and Military: The authority of the party is higher than everything. The people of the whole country know that the association has requested the central government to order party departments at all levels to supervise the local governments where they are located to strictly implement the opium ban in order to implement the opium ban, in the hope of eradicating the opium scourge as soon as possible and using the party's authority to supervise it, so as to avoid slackness. In addition, such as requesting the Ministry of Internal Affairs to notify the land and water public security organs to crack down on and punish opium offenders, and requesting the Ministry of Military Affairs to order the military inspection stations in various places not to confiscate the opium seized without authorization, all are plans to benefit the opium ban.</p>
<p>The above is just a summary of the most important aspects of the opium ban. Other trivial matters related to the scope of the opium ban are even more difficult for me to enumerate. A detailed report was submitted to the government and the academy for record every month. However, due to the limited space of the special issue, it is impossible to describe the events one by one. Although it is tomorrow's yellow flower, it is not as plain as it seems. I hope that the people of the country will not look at it indifferently. In the future, I hope that the government and the people will cooperate in the spirit of cooperation, and hold the perseverance of common struggle. On the June 3rd Opium Ban Commemoration Day, they will always print it in their minds and never forget it. Then, the century-old poison will not be difficult to eradicate completely. How can we not worry about the abolition of unequal treaties with foreign countries within the time limit? And the association's planning of the opium ban in the past year will not be in vain. I would like to encourage this with the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Anti-Drug Legacy</h3>
<p>Picture not finished</p>
<h3>Preface to the June 3rd Commemoration by Chen Dezheng</h3>
<p>The beginning of our country's conclusion of unequal treaties with foreign countries was the Treaty of Nanjing. The source of the disaster of the Treaty of Nanjing belongs to opium, which is a great disaster. Therefore, we who are striving for revolution should deeply feel that if we want to implement the abolition of unequal treaties, the first step is to start from prohibiting opium and all narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>Opium and all narcotic drugs are the main reasons for our country's diplomatic failure, internal affairs failure, banditry, and the rampant corruption. The spread of poison will inevitably lead to the destruction of the country and the extinction of the species. This is something that anyone can know and say. However, those who ban ban, those who sell sell, those who reject reject, and those who smoke smoke. Even now, the root cannot be blocked and the flow cannot be cut off. This is because our whole nation has not truly awakened. Now we can see the spread of poison everywhere we go. Under the rule of the revolutionary government, it has been discovered. This is something we cannot but be heartbroken about.</p>
<p>In recent decades, many of our people have been ruined by smoking opium. The foundation of social economy is increasingly shaken. The degree of danger can make us shiver. And from the perspective of the harm of poison, it damages the body and mind and wastes academic studies. It turns a strong and excellent nation into a sick man of East Asia. How terrible is the title? If we want to become stronger, we want to avenge ourselves, we want all the people of the country to truly wake up and unite to reject poison. It is necessary to have an agency with special responsibility to actively carry out it, so that practical results can be seen.</p>
<p>The Anti-Drug Association of the Republic of China has responded to our request and is doing such a difficult and important job. It has already achieved considerable results and has been praised by people all over the country. Its continued efforts to move forward are even more admired by us. Now, on the occasion of the publication of the Sixth and Third Special Edition, I am happy to say a few words, hoping to make more progress.</p>
<p>June 3rd Commemorative Special Issue</p>
<p>The opium scourge has been around for more than a hundred years. Floods and beasts are not comparable to it. Those who are harmed are like carbuncles attached to the body. The people are getting weaker and the country is getting greedier. Lin Gong's perseverance is to eliminate people, wash away filth and dirt, and not be afraid of stubbornness. Sun Yat-sen's legacy is to clarify the meaning and persevere to eliminate the poison for generations to come. Strength and weakness depend on survival. May the descendants of the Yellow Emperor not be ashamed of their ancestors and carry forward their greatness and not sink into it. Respectfully inscribed by Zhang Qun</p>
<h3>June 3rd Commemoration and Our Efforts by Huang Jiahui</h3>
<p>For more than a hundred years, imperialism has attacked weak nations with the means of plunder and annexation in order to achieve an advantageous economic position, not hesitating to shed people's blood and exterminate their species. The most cruel and sinister plan is the opium policy. Since the British used the power of warships and cannons to import opium into our country, the country has become weak and the people have become poor, and in recent years it has fallen into the position of a semi-colony. The British have succeeded in their economic invasion policy, not only filling the four treasuries, but also consolidating their position in the Far East. After that, all countries that developed to the Far East followed in the footsteps of the British and sought inspiration from the abundance of income from opium and narcotic drugs. Today, the drug scourge in our country is like a flood and cannot be contained. On this day of the Sixth and Third Burning Earth Commemoration, when we think back to Lin Gong Zexu's legacy and look at the rampant drug scourge in the country, we cannot help but shed tears. The past is gone, and the future is difficult. We should think about ways to remedy the situation and save the country's destiny. Today, those who run international opium and narcotic drugs, in addition to the giants of Britain, Germany, France, and Japan, also have small Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Persia, Turkey, and so on. They are too numerous to mention. They are all putting their full effort into our country, and the evil-doer behind the scenes is still the opium culprit that Lin Gong fought but did not win ninety years ago. During the spring, I was ordered by the Anti-Drug Association of the Republic of China to travel to the colonies of various countries in Southeast Asia. The facts I heard and witnessed deeply know that the success of the colonial policy and the prosperity of the colonial government all depend on the income from opium trade. The opium tax rate for overseas Chinese in the British and Dutch colonies alone has reached more than 130 million yuan in national currency every year, and the amount of Indian-Persian opium exported from Singapore last year also exceeded 19 million taels, and 90% of those who use these poisons are our people. We who are engaged in the movement of rejecting drugs and saving the country should have a deep understanding of this enemy, make a thorough determination, and follow in Lin Gong's footsteps to attack this poison that destroys the country and exterminates the species. In order to achieve final success, we must break this inhuman conspiracy between countries. As for the poisonous seedlings that have not been cleared in the country and the opium that is full of it, they cannot be tolerated under the clear blue sky and the bright sun. We should unite as one and eliminate them completely. We should comfort Lin Gong and Sun Yat-sen's spirits in heaven, and not waste this day's commemoration every year.</p>
<h3>Lin Gong's Legacy of Rejecting Drugs</h3>
<p>The poison of opium is more harmful than floods and beasts. There is no one in the world who thinks that opium does not need to be banned... If this disaster is not eliminated, there will be no usable soldiers and no funds to raise in ten years... The poison of opium spreads inland, like carbuncles poisoning the human body. Carbuncles will gradually become pus, and opium will gradually lead to bandits... We must eliminate opium completely in order to eradicate the root cause of the disease.</p>
<h3>Famous Quotes and Candid Remarks on the June 3rd Commemoration by Tan Yankai</h3>
<p>The harm of opium has been around for a long time. The whole world is indulged in it, but only Marquis Lin of Fujian rose up to eliminate it. Although his ambition was not fulfilled, it is still in people's eyes and ears. He is vigorous and energetic. Now the government is vigorously implementing the opium ban. In memory of the former sages, he is spreading it to show the world the precision and sincerity of the former sages in dealing with affairs and the strategy of resisting foreign countries. His majesty is so radiant that it is beyond what we can imagine today. Who made me leak and tie up for ninety years and shake my hands and feet? Alas, alas. Although there are no old adults, there is still a model. It is still in the palm of your hand to be determined and have something to do.</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin</h3>
<p>Hanmin grew up in Guangdong. As a child, he often heard people tell stories about Commissioner Lin burning opium. Later, when he studied, he saw many records of Commissioner Lin's achievements. When he was twenty, he tutored at the home of Mr. Lin's grandson, Mr. Shen, who often recounted stories of Mr. Lin. This made him admire him even more. Commentators said that Mr. Lin strictly enforced the opium ban to assert national rights and eliminate the people's suffering. Everything he did was appropriate. However, the eight characters "goods to be confiscated, people to be executed" were implemented too hastily. At first, Hanmin did not know how these eight characters were applied at the time. It was only after reading the imperial edicts of the 17th and 21st days of the ninth month of the Jihai year that he understood that foreign merchant ships were required to sign a bond. If they violated the opium ban, their goods would be confiscated and the people would be executed. The various countries had already agreed to the first four characters, but they protested only against "people to be executed." However, Mr. Lin's integrity and unwavering principles were enough to make those who had been self-deprecating and obsequious to foreigners for a hundred years blush with shame. At that time, the entire Qing court was incompetent and cowardly, and a fear of everything had become the prevailing atmosphere. It was especially rare that Mr. Lin was so upright and unyielding. The so-called "too hasty implementation" should not be considered a flaw in Mr. Lin. In his later years, when someone asked him about foreign affairs, Mr. Lin said, "England is a maritime nation. In the future, the one who will cause trouble for China will be Russia." Since the late Qing dynasty, Mr. Lin's words have seemed remarkably accurate. With his profound knowledge, he was sent to the border region, and what he saw and heard gave him foresight. However, only someone who worried about the nation for his entire life could have achieved this. Mr. Lin was not just a capable minister for a time. Today, the people are highly aware of the harm of opium. The government has established a committee to strictly manage this matter and commemorate Mr. Lin. Recalling what I saw and heard as a child, I cannot help but admire and lament.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui</h3>
<p>When Chonghui was young, he read the political writings of Lin Wenzhong and learned about the Opium War. Later, when he studied in Europe and America, people there often praised Mr. Lin's character but deeply regretted that the Qing court did not tolerate his uprightness. Chonghui often wondered about this. From Genghis Khan in the early Yuan dynasty to Wenzhong, their intention was not to invade but to seek justice. Therefore, the Opium War was actually the first cry of struggle between the Chinese nation and foreigners. In that case, Wenzhong was actually rich in anti-foreign sentiment. Yet, foreigners praised him as virtuous. Is this what is meant by justice? In a war for justice, right and wrong are more important than success or failure. Even if one fails, it is not one's fault. The people of the country would naturally feel regret and astonishment. Even foreigners would be shocked and respectful, believing that the cause of the failure lies with those who should be held responsible, and not with that person. Alas, how can this be compared to a war of anti-foreignism? After the defeat in this war, Wenzhong was slandered and died. The scourge of opium has persisted for a hundred years until today, still troubling the government with concerns about prohibition. Recalling the past deeds of Wenzhong, it is not only our country's misfortune but also the lack of justice in the world. Chonghui once read Western history. The Boston Tea Party in America was triggered by resistance to British tea taxes. At that time, the Americans threw all the tea carried by British ships into the sea. This event is very similar to Wenzhong's destruction of opium. However, America gained a Washington, won a war, and became independent from England, now hailed as a powerful nation. We lost a Lin Wenzhong, suffered a defeat in a war, and were bound by unequal treaties, which grew even more severe. Alas, although there is luck and misfortune, it is enough to see how important it is for a country to have the right person dealing with foreign affairs. The relationship is so crucial.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting</h3>
<p>A natural poison has brought disaster to China, almost causing the nation to perish. It is the second greatest scourge, like a flood or a beast. Who is greater than Lin Zexu, who knew the great harm it caused a hundred years ago and used all his strength to resist it? In the end, the Opium War exposed the inhumanity of imperialism, so that after thousands of generations, when we look back on the past, the pain remains. This can truly be said to be a contribution no less than that of Yu the Great. I have always said that in the Qing dynasty's two hundred years, Mr. Lin was the only one who knew the world situation. At that time, the deaf and blind officials were terrified by the force of the cannons and exiled Mr. Lin before surrendering and making peace. This is truly a historical tragedy, like the sudden recall of Yue Wu Mu in the Southern Song dynasty. Now, having suffered for too long and too severely, the world uses this as a warning. The people of the country are gradually becoming aware. From a state of anesthesia, they suddenly cry out loudly. The anti-drug movement has become a universal indignation. With the success of the revolution, the powers have changed their views. The British also dare not openly commit injustice. After extreme deprivation, recovery is near. Therefore, since the national government announced the anniversary of Mr. Lin's burning of opium, the people of the whole country have risen in response, singing in harmony. A grand commemoration is held to publicize the opium disaster, which is deeply engraved in the minds of our people, serving as a warning.</p>
<h3>Outline for the Construction of the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>Lin Zexu was the first to advocate banning opium. His heroic spirit is admired for eternity. Today, the opium disaster is rampant and even worse.

Recalling the legacy of the sages and promoting their spirit, it is especially important to have appropriate commemorations to serve as models. Now, we respectfully present the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) This association will contact Mr. Lin's family, sympathetic organizations, and government offices to formulate detailed plans for implementation.</p>
<p>(2) The memorial hall will be the location for the office and meetings of this association.</p>
<p>(3) The memorial hall will include a library for rejecting drugs, collecting Chinese and foreign publications on rejecting drugs, both ancient and modern.</p>
<p>(4) The memorial hall will include an art gallery for rejecting drugs, displaying various touring exhibits of this association and other art products related to rejecting drugs.</p>
<p>(5) The memorial hall will include a research institute for the treatment of narcotic drugs, engaging in chemical experiments and research on drugs for quitting opium.</p>
<h3>Dr. Wang Jingqi, the Initiator of the June 3rd Commemoration</h3>

<h3>Announcement of the August 29th Commemoration</h3>
<p>The June 3rd commemoration was already held with great fanfare. On the one hand, it shows our country's determination to ban opium. On the other hand, it promotes the awakening of the powers. After June 3rd, there is also the August 29th commemoration—the 88th anniversary of the national humiliation when the British imperialists forced the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War. The Treaty of Nanjing was the beginning of unequal treaties in our country. It is an important reason for our country's diplomatic failures over the past eighty years, the lack of internal governance, the rampant bandits, and the rampant treachery. We want to complete the revolution, eliminate opium, save the nation from danger, and relieve the people's suffering. For this kind of commemoration, we should have four goals: (1) Strive for revolutionary diplomacy to abolish unequal treaties. (2) Effectively ban opium to eliminate harm to the people and wash away national humiliation. (3) Reform officialdom to eliminate the root of misleading the country and harming the people. (4) Complete the construction of the Three Principles of the People to relieve the various oppressions that our country has suffered since the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Financial Institutions Closed, Interest Rates Weak, Short-Term Loans Firm</h3>
<p>Copper Coins Rise Again by Two Thousand</p>
<p>Market Overview: The day before yesterday was a national holiday, and businesses were closed as usual. Because the day before yesterday also fell on a Sunday, banks were required to observe an additional day of closure. As a result, yesterday all banks on the Bund, except for the Central Bank, were equivalent to a normal Sunday. The Jianghai Customs also collected taxes as usual, but because the banks were closed, tax revenue was very low. It is said that short-term silver loans in the money market were slightly firmer, and foreign interest rates continued to weaken.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: (Foreign Interest Rates) The opening price was 7 yuan, 1 fen, 7 li, 7 hao, and 5 si, half a li lower than the price at the end of last month, showing a very weak trend. The afternoon price continued to drop by a fraction of a hao and 2 si, to 7 yuan, 1 fen, 7 li, 6 hao, and 2 si. It has fallen by as much as 3 to 5 li in a few days. (Silver Loans) The morning price was slightly firmer at 2 qian. The afternoon price was reduced by 3 fen, calculated as 1 qian and 7 fen. There were no market conditions for bank postings and markups.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: The morning price of Jiangnan small foreign coins remained at 6 qian and 2 fen, with little change from before.

The price of Guangdong small foreign coins was 5 qian, 9 fen, and 8 li in the morning and 5 qian, 9 fen, and 9 li in the afternoon, an improvement of 3 to 4 li compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 165,000 jiao in the morning and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon. The price of copper coins increased by 2,000 wen, to 412,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: (Silver) Due to the banks' additional holiday, there was no news of various routine collections and releases. Money shops collected and released silver for two days combined, making it particularly complicated. The total amount was more than 55 million. Remittances from all sources amounted to more than 800,000. (Foreign Currency) The volume of draft remittances was 1.21 million in the morning and 1.17 million in the afternoon. The volume of banknotes was 45,000 in the morning and 145,000 in the afternoon. The volume of off-market banknotes was 122,000 in the morning and 75,000 in the afternoon. Only small Chinese banks conducted limited trading, with interbank trading of 800,000 to 900,000 in both sessions. Small money shops traded more than 300,000. Money shops collected and released more than 8.3 million in foreign currency, with limited outflows of only 300,000.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Retreats After Rising</h3>
<p>Profit-Taking Occurs, Raw Cotton Remains Expensive and Supportive</p>
<p>The yarn market has turned flat and is slightly weaker. The actual reason is that the continuous rise in recent days has prompted profit-taking, leading to a market correction. However, a major decline has not been observed, as raw cotton remains firm and expensive, and manufacturers cannot make a profit. Therefore, the situation can still be maintained. For a time, it seems impossible for the majority of targets to temporarily break through 60 liang. Therefore, there are still many people shorting the market. The market sentiment has turned peaceful. Actual sales in the market are still good. In short, there are still bottom goods available. 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd dull yarn sales are stagnant. Therefore, the near-month price is still suppressed by it. Sellers are still confident.</p>
<p>Increased Number of Bids and Accounts on the Exchange: At the opening of the exchange's bid market, the increased number of sellers caused the market to loosen and fall. In the second and third sessions, Da Ji, Gong Tai, and Yu Da sold off large quantities, and the contract amounts were relatively large, so the market became weak. As a result, the prices of all months fell by 5, 6, and 7 qian. In the afternoon, the market situation remained flat, as the price of Three Grades yarn also fell by 4 or 5 yuan, and market sentiment was particularly weak. The market situation was softened, and the price of each month rose or fell by 1 to 3 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 17,050 bales. The closing price of the bid market is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Bid Market Closing Price, Fall, Open Interest</p>
<p>September: 158.3, Fall 5, 1,665</p>
<p>June: 155.6, Fall 7, 2,900</p>
<p>October: 158.45, Fall 13, 700</p>
<p>July: 156.57, Fall 2,340</p>
<p>November: 158.8</p>
<p>August: 157.48, Fall 2,550</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Good: According to the statistics of the day's purchases by various groups, a total of 1,430 bales were purchased. 660 bales were traded within the trade. The prices were flat. The most customer bales came from Tianjin, at 340 bales. In addition, 360 bales came from inland China, 180 bales from Shantou, 35 bales from Xiamen, 86 bales from Yunnan, 30 bales from Xuzhou, 25 bales from Hong Kong, 200 bales from Sichuan, 60 bales from Guangdong, and 50 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Falls as Japanese and Chinese Merchants Sell Heavily</h3>
<p>The sudden retreat in the cotton market was actually caused by the rapid rise, prompting Japanese and Chinese merchants to take the opportunity to sell off large quantities. The contract amounts were substantial, so market sentiment loosened. However, the majority of retail investors turned from short to long, so even though there were large sales, absorption remained strong, and the market situation remained firm. If the exchange rate eases slightly, the cotton market may have a round of correction. Actual sales to factories remain sluggish.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Take Profits: At the opening of the Chinese market on the exchange, profit-takers settled accounts. Chinese and Japanese merchants sold off large quantities, and the market price suddenly fell by 3 or 4 qian. The prices rose slightly in the second and third sessions. As a result, this month's prices fell by 4.5 qian due to the lock-in sales by the Match Factory group, and the prices of distant months fell by 2 qian to 1.5 fen. In the afternoon, the market situation stabilized, and the prices of each month rose or fell by 5 fen to 1 qian. The closing price is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Chinese Market Closing Price, Fall, Open Interest</p>
<p>August: 37.00, Fall 255,470</p>
<p>June: 36.30, Fall 40,660</p>
<p>October: 36.05, Fall 20,436</p>
<p>July: 36.95, Fall 25,684</p>
<p>November: 35.90</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Trading Is Quiet: Factory managers still see the market as quiet. The source of goods includes 280 bales of Tonghua cotton and 400 bales of Yaohua cotton. The sales record is shown on the left:</p>
<p>Laokou 39.00 Shanghai Factory Purchased 300 Pieces For Factory Use</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 37.25 Newly Established Factory Purchased 250 Pieces For Factory Use</p>
<p>American Cotton 38.00 Puyi Factory Purchased 400 Pieces For Factory Use</p>

<h3>American Cotton Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>Excessive Rainfall Recently Requires Replanting</p>
<p>Boll Weevils Gradually Appear in the Atlantic States</p>
<p>Anticipation of Cotton Crop Panic in the Summer</p>
<p>A New York dispatch from the 30th reported on cotton market conditions, stating that there was no one listening to cotton crop news. Trading on the cotton exchange this week was unusually light. Bad trade news offset any unfavorable developments in cotton production. Recently, there has been excessive rainfall, and there have been repeated reports that replanting is necessary in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas, delaying agricultural work. Some sources say that cotton production will be four to five days behind previous cotton seasons after June. Boll weevils are gradually appearing in the Atlantic states, Mississippi, and southwestern Texas, but there are not many yet. The representative of the local brokers, the cotton industry cooperative, received a total of 492,000 bales for the May period in New York and 84,000 bales in New Orleans. Speculation is not strong. When prices fall, some people buy in, anticipating a cotton crop panic in the summer.</p>
<p>The cotton market is currently sluggish and uninteresting after the unprecedented delivery. Spot cotton demand is weak. The domestic spinning industry is in very poor condition and continues to reduce production. Cotton planting is progressing well, and the weather is better than before.</p>
<p>The statistics for the previous week are attached below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Japanese Yarn Mills Decide to Reduce Working Hours Again</h3>
<p>Plan to Reduce by One Tenth Starting the 6th</p>
<p>An Osaka dispatch from the 30th stated that the directors of the Japan Spinners' Association have decided to further reduce production by 10 percent, bringing the total reduction to about 27 percent including the existing reductions. This decision must be submitted to the general meeting on June 7 for approval. If passed, this new plan will be implemented from June 16 to the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Indian-British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Bombay: There is nothing to report for the past week due to the futures market being closed for many days. The market for low-grade fair Gujar cotton is very firm due to strong demand. Japanese exporters are not very active except for slightly buying Oomra cotton. Due to the low silver price and unfavorable exchange rates in China, there is even less trading. Local manufacturers still have good demand for standard cotton. In general, various grades of superior standard cotton will decrease in the next season. The attached statistics for the past week are as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week Last Week</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1 3,111 3,168</p>
<p>Current Stock at the End of the Week 1,273 1,256</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports Since September 1 1,974 2,009</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 659 618</p>
<p>Shipped to China 320 330</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 947 950</p>
<p>Other Regions 48 48</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot demand has slightly improved in the past week, but most of it is export trading. The global situation is not good in the futures market, and the Department of Agriculture is holding 1 million bales, so the situation is very quiet. At present, buyers are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see policy to observe the development of the new crop. Egyptian cotton business is also quiet.</p>
<h3>Grain and River-Bottom Rice Market Rises</h3>
<p>Store Sales Are Refreshed After the Summer Festival</p>
<p>Zhabei: The total number of boats arriving from various groups has been only about twenty since the 20th. The market sales are brisk because store sales are refreshed after the summer festival. The price of Northern Japonica rice has risen by more than 2 jiao. The price of top-quality Japonica rice has reached 21 yuan. Although medium and lower grades of Japonica rice have also risen, transactions are fragmented. However, the current river-bottom stocks of high-grade rice are perceived to be scarce. The market is uniformly tight. There are fewer shipments of thin rice. Shipments from this street have slightly increased, and the market price has risen by 1 jiao. The top-quality mutton dujian is scarce and has good sales. The price has risen by about 1 jiao. The market situation is that goods are sold as soon as they arrive. Biànyuán sales are not strong, and dining sales are also on the sidelines. The overall market is similar to before the suspension of sales.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: The market was very firm in the past two days. More than ten boats arrived from river-bottom areas, and the sales of each stall varied. Changshu and Xichang machine-milled Japonica rice have been in demand in the countryside, so most prices have been raised. Small numbers of customer groups are purchasing, so prices have risen by 1 jiao. The price of particularly top-quality Japonica rice here is more than 20 yuan. The retail sales of Suzhou and Tongzhou machine-milled Japonica rice are also not quiet, and it is after the Dragon Boat Festival, so shops must replenish their supplies, so the overall market has also risen by about 1 jiao. The source of Southern early thin rice is inherently limited, and inventory has also decreased, so the market price is very stable. Because there are only a few sales, the inventory and arrivals of mutton dujian rice are still scarce. Due to the influence of foreign rice, the market is very quiet. The market is still lacking in vigor. Biànyuán sales continue to be weak, and prices are gradually decreasing. The whole market is generally tight and active, except for the stagnant Xiangyuan rice.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Rises in the Morning and Falls in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>A Rise and Fall of Two Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions were very good after the opening. Due to the strike in Rangoon, arrivals have decreased. The cargo owners are unanimously bullish and firm. In the morning, Hankou merchants and inland customers purchased actively, and the price rose sharply by 2 jiao. In the afternoon, various groups stopped purchasing due to high prices. The cargo owners, because the price had already risen sufficiently and were worried that arrivals would surge after the Rangoon strike subsided, took the opportunity to sell, and the price immediately fell by 2 jiao. As a result, the market remained similar to the previous day, only leaving a trace of a sharp rise. A total of 15,000 bags were opened, half of which were small grades. The prices were: No. 1 Saigon, 16 yuan and 2 jiao to 16 yuan; No. 2, 15 yuan and 5 jiao and a half; small grades, 15 yuan, 7 jiao, 2 fen to 15 yuan and 4 jiao; large grades, 15 yuan and 4 jiao; Min Dang, 15 yuan, 7 jiao, 2 fen to 15 yuan and a half; one-week delivery, 15 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen; Annam long-grain rice, more than 17 yuan and 3 jiao; small grades of brown rice, 14 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen.</p>
<h3>More Than a Thousand Bags of New Wheat Have Arrived</h3>
<p>Low Quality, Factories Buy Old Wheat for Grinding, Old Wheat Prices Fall by Seven Fen. The first batch of new wheat arriving in Shanghai is from Penglai (i.e., Penglong Town Wheat). The price opened at 4.5 liang to 4 liang, 3 qian, 3 fen, but the quality is low and not up to standard. There are more than a thousand bags in total, which are boat shipments and are bought by major factories for grinding. After the arrival of new wheat, due to the obsolescence of old wheat, cargo owners are eager to sell it off. The price of 1,300 bags of train shipments from Bengbu and Qingjiang opened at 5 liang and 8 fen, down 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Factories and Xibang Merchants Compete</h3>
<p>Market Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>After the opening of yesterday's futures wheat market, it attracted attention from both insiders and outsiders due to the simultaneous listing of new wheat. Furthermore, the market was supported by factories and Xibang merchants, and market sentiment was heated. The price for June immediately reached 4 liang and 6 qian, a jump of 6 fen. Distant contracts were bid up, and prices rose even more enthusiastically. As a result, the maximum price for September was 4 liang, 6 qian, and 8 fen, an increase of 1 qian and 3 fen, while the closing price was reduced by 2 fen, a gain of 1 qian. The August and October prices were each up 1 qian, the June price was up 9 fen, and the July price was up 7 fen. The initial bid for November was 4 liang, 7 qian, and 9 fen, with a closing price.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Opens This Year's New Record</h3>
<p>New Bulls Compete with Factories</p>
<p>Inland New Wheat Prices Open Very High</p>
<p>Market Prices Open Wild</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market conditions were rising across the board after the opening in the morning. Because the buying sentiment was very good, coupled with the competition from new bulls such as Xibang merchants, Changbang merchants, and factories, prices immediately rose by 1 or 2 fen. After the second round, prices rose step by step. Furthermore, the inland new wheat prices opened very high, and factories firmly refused to sell. The shorts were afraid, and the buyers boosted the market, resulting in wild prices. The October price rose by 6.75 fen, which is the highest record of increase this year. The September price was up 5.5 fen, the August price was up 4.5 fen, the June price was up 2.75 fen, and the July price was up 4.25 fen. The initial bid for early November was 2 liang, 4 qian, and 2.5 fen, and the closing price was 2 liang, 4 qian, and 4.5 fen.</p>
<h3>The Soaring Price of Soybean Cakes</h3>
<p>Soybeans: Yesterday's market experienced a meteoric rise. The good news from Dalian was undoubtedly a factor, but the influence of the gold market was also a major contributor. Upon investigation, it was found that the source of the problem was the unfavorable price difference between Dalian and Shanghai, which had severely hampered market activity. Fortunately, local inventories were sufficient, resulting in a stable market situation before the holiday. However, yesterday's market saw a drastic change in circumstances. Existing soybean traders suddenly became active, and major hoarding firms were also eager to participate. However, sellers, recognizing the changing situation, adopted a wait-and-see approach and resisted selling. As a result, the price of ordinary soybeans soared by one cent, opening at a high of 5.60 taels. The standard June futures contract also surged by nine cents to 5.68 taels. The market showed strong demand, and shipments of Yangtze River soybeans, which were previously slow-moving, also followed the upward trend, with over 5,000 bags traded. Currently, the small-scale oil mills and traders on this street are all very active.</p>
<p>Soybean Cakes: Due to the sudden surge in raw material prices and the continuous upward movement in the Dalian market, sales are becoming increasingly brisk, and the market is rapidly rising. Dalian cakes opened at 1.88 taels yesterday, a significant increase of three or four cents compared to the pre-holiday price. This kind of price surge is truly rare. The futures market is experiencing a gradual increase in sales due to depleted inventories and strong customer demand. As a result, the afternoon market was very strong, with the June and July futures contracts moving in tandem with the spot market, also opening at 1.88 taels, a jump of three cents. All traders are actively buying, and further price increases are inevitable.</p>
<h3>The Cuban Sugar Market Opens Briskly</h3>
<p>Raw and White Sugar Prices Rise Sharply After Initial Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw no trading in Cuban sugar due to the holiday. The exchange opened with a strong market for Dutch No. 24 raw and white sugar. The initial transaction price was 7.375 taels, with strong buying interest. The price then rose to 7.40 taels, but the market gradually leveled off as selling activity slightly increased and buyers became hesitant. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 7.30 taels, with a relatively brisk market. No. 10 Dutch red sugar saw some trading at 5.925 taels. High-grade goods were priced at 6.00 taels, but there were no takers, and the market also became firm. The trend for Japanese sugar was even sharper. Minghua YRO was priced up to 7.05 taels, YT at 7.08 taels, YP at 8.00 taels, Meiji goods at 8.05 taels, and ER at 8.10 to 8.15 taels. The market was strong across the board, and the upward trend continued. Taikoo refined sugar opened with a five-cent increase, but only B and CX grades were available, the rest were out of stock. Five Warm BA continued to rise by one cent, with talk of further increases of one cent or more due to foreign exchange rates, and some prices were quoted in Hong Kong silver dollars. The exchange listed 110 bags of domestic semi-South Qing sugar at 5.30 yuan. Yesterday, Zhenxiang Trading Company sold over 1,000 bags of Cuban sugar at 6.60 yuan, with strong buying interest and a very strong market.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Pickled Mustard Tubers Selling Well</h3>
<p>High-Quality Goods Open at 34 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the new crop of pickled mustard tubers became available, approximately 30,000 jars have arrived. After sales, the current inventory is estimated to be about half of that. Recently, the number of high-quality goods available has been limited, priced at 34 yuan, while lower-grade tubers are selling well for less than 30 yuan. Market prices are 34 yuan for high-quality tubers and 28-29 yuan for lower-quality ones. It is rumored that a large quantity of the subsequent batch is still on its way, which may slightly ease customer demand.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Factory Silk Has No Movement Due to European Cables</h3>
<p>Prices Remain Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in this city remained stagnant due to a lack of movement in the overseas silk market yesterday morning. However, European firms, at the request of Chinese silk merchants, sent out numerous new futures silk cables with firm price quotes. Yesterday, Mitsui and others only traded 40 bales of new factory silk, with no gains or losses reported.</p>
<h3>Tonghai Silkworm Cocoons Average 40% Yield</h3>
<p>Cocoon Prices Average 56 Yuan</p>
<p>This year's silkworm crop in Tongzhou and Haimen suffered due to the unrest caused by bandits. The number of households raising silkworms decreased, and the unfavorable weather conditions led to significant losses of silkworm eggs. The new silkworm harvest yielded only 40% of a normal year's crop. After the opening of the cocoon market, the amount of cocoons collected was sparse, with only five days of weighing completed. Each household's total collection was only around 1,000 piculs. Foreign silkworm varieties fetched higher prices, opening at 60 yuan, while domestic varieties ranged from 48 to 50 yuan, with an average price of 56 yuan. The quality of the cocoons is said to be poor.</p>
<h3>Jintan and Liyang Cocoon Markets Close</h3>
<p>Most Acquisitions Fall Short, Cocoon Prices Range from 56 to 63 Yuan</p>
<p>This year's new cocoons in Jintan and Liyang counties were generally of poor quality, with yields only 30-40% of a normal year. Cocoon markets only operated for 30% of the usual time, with weighing lasting six or seven days. Acquisitions were very limited, but the cocoons were of reasonable quality. Each market collected at most 1,000 piculs, and at least 600-700 piculs. Cocoon markets have now closed. The highest price was for improved varieties, which opened at 72-73 yuan. The average price in Jintan was 55-56 yuan, and in Liyang, 62-63 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan New Cocoons Are of Inferior Quality and Price</h3>
<p>The Western Township Cocoons are the Worst, with Prices Averaging 55 Yuan</p>
<p>This year's silkworm crop in the four townships of Xiaoshan suffered due to the local unrest, resulting in a reduction in the number of households raising silkworms. The inconsistent climate also contributed to a poor cocoon harvest. The number of cocoon markets operating was only 40-50% of last year's. The cocoon market has now closed. This year's cocoons from Xiaoshan are of poor quality, with thin shells. The domestic cocoons from the western townships are the worst, while those from the eastern townships are slightly better. However, the foreign cocoons have the best shell quality. The markets are not accepting inferior cocoons, and cocoon prices are relatively low. Domestic varieties are opening at only 50-55 yuan, while foreign varieties are at 60 yuan, with an average price of 55 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Department of Agriculture Dispatches Personnel to Supervise Silkworm Egg Production</h3>
<p>China's silk industry is making rapid progress, with silkworm egg production farms springing up in various provinces, showing great potential for rapid development. The Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining attaches great importance to the production of silkworm eggs and has established a silkworm industry control office to oversee the process. As the current silkworm market comes to a close, various farms are now in the silkworm collection and egg production period. Therefore, more than ten inspectors, including Su Jing, have been specially selected and dispatched to various provincial silkworm egg production farms to provide guidance.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market: Red Tea Firm, Green Tea Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Qi Men high-grade black tea from EWO and Jardine Matheson continued to be popular, with a total of 1,955 boxes traded in the city, opening at 220 taels at the top end. The market trend remains firm. However, green tea sales are becoming increasingly sluggish. Transactions in various teas, except for Ping Shui plum tea, are limited. Most importantly, most firms are not even discussing Zhen Mei green tea. At the time when new teas are coming onto the market, such a quiet market situation is disheartening. However, the Russian Tea Assistance Association, which handles tea in China, is rumored to be arriving in Shanghai soon. If they can actively get involved, it may be possible to reverse the decline.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Japanese Exchange Rate Soars, and Goods Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Piece Goods Transactions: Due to the previous end-of-month settlement, traders in this street were at a standstill. However, the business of offloading goods has been quite active due to the impact of the soaring Japanese exchange rate. It is highly possible that goods prices will rise sharply in the future. Due to the high price of gold, it is becoming difficult to place orders. Therefore, wealthy customers are rushing to purchase existing goods. Large quantities of Donghu Yuanzhi tribute cloth, fine serge, printed Yuanzhi tribute cloth, and large swirling pattern serge have been traded. Those holding goods are in urgent need of funds, so their opening prices are low. Prices for goods from established firms have gradually risen. Fine serge is up by 0.5%, with Lake Pavilion blue-gray at 2.425 taels, assorted colors at 2.40 taels, Happy blue-gray at 2.40 taels, assorted colors at 2.375 taels, and Zijinshan assorted colors at 2.35 taels. Yuanzhi satin is up by 0.25%, with First Achievement opening at 2.55 taels and Four Scholars at 2.475 taels. However, due to increased arrivals of white crepe cloth, prices have slightly fallen. Banana leaf pattern stripes are at 2.975 taels, the same price as the "person and dog" pattern. There is a shortage of copper plate goods. Foreign stripes and poplin are being purchased by the Changjiang traders at 3.60 taels, Rongchang goods at 3.65 taels, and Dekang goods at 3.90 taels.</p>
<h3>Woolen Summer Goods Sell Briskly, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Waterproof Raincoat Fabric Also Experiences Price Decline and Strong Sales</p>
<p>The retail and wholesale trade of woolen goods has been extremely lively recently. Traders in this street have mutual needs, and the sales of summer goods are particularly brisk. Tailors specializing in Western-style clothing are particularly eager to buy. Here are some of the most recent popular goods with falling prices:</p>
<p>Vienna Ear: 3T is the most widely sold, while 1T and 2T are rarely sought after. Therefore, most of the arrivals are 3T. 3T is well-suited for Western suits and is most popular in the summer. It is 30 inches wide and comes in gray, white, and yellow, all of which are in demand. Last year, it was selling for only 1.55 taels per yard. This year, due to the sharp depreciation of the pound sterling and increased costs, the opening price has also risen, selling for 1.90 taels. It then rose again to 2.00 taels, due to a shortage of supply. Yesterday, the wholesale exchange's market price had risen to 2.15 taels.</p>
<p>Waterproof Raincoat Fabric: Since opening after the New Year, it has been increasing steadily, for ten or more times, with a total increase of seven or eight cents per yard (last year, the highest price was only 2.95 taels). It is now selling for 3.85 taels. Initially, gray could be had for a cheaper price of one or two cents, due to a shortage of raw goods. However, as it sold more and more, and savvy traders secretly absorbed the market, it became even more prosperous. The original gray was universally increased in price and was once out of stock. Shipments to Shanghai began about ten days ago, but the number of goods remained insufficient. Its shortage, firm prices, and prolonged upward trend are the best in the woolen industry this year.</p>
<h3>The Oil Market: Asphalt Market Becomes Increasingly Stable</h3>
<p>After news spread that the asphalt production area had accumulated limited inventory, companies short on supply paid close attention. According to reports from Hankou, sales have not been as quiet as they were a week ago. Traders are also taking the opportunity to raise prices. Zhu Hongzhong Jing has already sold for 14.4 taels, San Heng for 14.2 taels, and miscellaneous brands and heavy branches for 14 taels. Although Macheng oil is only 13.8 taels, most sales are for June and July, so a price increase is inevitable. The soap factories in this city have sold off most of their inventory, so they will not be in a rush. However, the fact that there is such momentum during the summer, which is normally a slow season, is remarkable. After this price increase, the foundation has been solidified. Even if sales clear during hot weather, there is no concern of a price decrease.</p>

<h3>The Southern Society Holds Its Third Public Performance</h3>
<p>Since its second public performance in July of last year by the Drama Group, the Southern Society has focused more on literature and art over the past year. Now, as the dramatic arts are in a period of high development, the Drama Group is willing to share what it has been actively preparing for in recent months. The Society's performance is divided into three parts. The first performance is Tian Han's adaptation of Prosper Mérimée's "Carmen," starring Ms. Yu Shan, in six acts and eleven scenes, making it the Southern Society's longest drama to date. Although Mérimée's novel was written over a century ago, the play allows us to hear the voices of the Spanish people today. The second major performance includes Kolontai's "Red Love" and Tian Han's "New Year's Eve Trial." The third performance features Tian Han's group dramas "Waterway" and "Take Back the Pledge." The first performance is scheduled to take place from the 11th to the 13th of this month, with a three-day run at the Central Grand Theater. The second and third performances will follow in quick succession, in order to live up to the expectations of the community over the past year.</p>
<h3>A Few Days of Theatrical Life by Peng Chenghui</h3>
<p>I was born active. Whatever I enjoy or am willing to do, I do with all my heart. Therefore, whether at home or abroad, many people say that I "don't know the limits" and have a "childlike nature." However, I let them say what they will, and I continue to run wild with my passionate personality.</p>
<p>This time, the Shanghai Drama Association performed Shakespeare's masterpiece, "The Merchant of Venice," at the Central Auditorium. At the warm invitation of teachers and friends, and fueled by my active emotions, I happily joined in. As a result, I found myself occupying a position among the dozens of lively actors.</p>
<p>Although I did not play a major role, I enjoyed the theatrical life of those few days all the same. I found these experiences to be truly interesting, something that cannot be felt in everyday life. Although the period was very short, it felt particularly meaningful, particularly interesting, and particularly invigorating in my monotonous and rigid daily life. Now, I will write down everything I have felt below:</p>
<p>A Harmonious Group: I was truly amazed by the spirit of cooperation within the Drama Association. Although there were more than fifty actors from all walks of life, everyone was very cooperative, very hardworking, and very responsible. There was no sign of anyone shirking their duties, and everyone was very gentle and amiable, with no air of arrogance. I am a newcomer, but after some introductions and conversations, I felt like everyone had a smile on their face, everyone was very approachable, and everyone was like an old friend. As a result, I did not feel awkward or uneasy at all. I did not feel like they were new acquaintances. We talked freely, we laughed freely. Indeed, I felt like it was a truly harmonious group.</p>
<p>The Earth as a Table: Because the place was too cramped, there was no proper dining table like the neat, orderly, and solemn tables in our school. At mealtime, we had to use the earth as a table. But even so, we did not feel uncomfortable at all. On the contrary, we felt very interesting and very happy. We ate fried rice. Whenever the restaurant staff brought the rice, they would place bowl after bowl on the ground, and we would smile at each other and squat down to pick them up. Some sat to eat, some stood to eat, some walked to eat, and some squatted to eat. If you didn't have enough, I would give you some; if I didn't have enough, you would give me some, until everyone had eaten to their heart's content. I felt that this way of eating was much more interesting than sitting in some big hotel, enjoying the bright lights and fine wines, and eating expensive delicacies.</p>
<p>Going to the Guillotine: In some scenes of this play, some members needed to have their faces painted like the bottom of a pot. Therefore, we called these actors "Pot Bottom Faces" or "Azrica." The process involved first applying cold cream and then painting various colors on it. However, this painting method caused the face to experience an unbearable itch, and you couldn't scratch it because the colors would be smeared. So, every time it was my turn to have this kind of face painted, I was lazy and reluctant to accept it. Therefore, I called this painting of the face "Going to the Guillotine," and the person who painted me would also call me "Going to the Guillotine." "Hey, Going to the Guillotine!" Every time I heard this order, I knew that I had to have the pot bottom face painted.</p>
<p>Competing to Be a Noble: Several of us, fearing that we would have to go to the guillotine, were constantly looking for opportunities to switch roles. Once, one of the actors playing a nobleman was absent due to some matter. Several of us comrades who feared having our faces painted were smiling and competing to do it (in the same scene). "Hey, let me do it!" one said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Your face doesn't look like a nobleman at all," one replied with a smile.</p>
<p>In the end, it was given to me. Some said I didn't look like a nobleman at all, while others said I looked exactly like one. I didn't care. I just put on the nobleman's clothes, put on the nobleman's hat, and went to the courtroom with a relaxed attitude.</p>
<p>The Director Dancing: Naturally, this play itself is a world-renowned and immortal masterpiece. And the actors in this performance were indeed able to fully express its greatness. The sad parts could make people cry, the humorous parts could make people laugh, the angry parts could make people gnash their teeth, and the serene parts could make people feel like they were sitting in a deep mountain valley. The expression of the entire play can indeed make the audience's feelings change in a thousand ways, forgetting that they are in a theater. This is not me deliberately nitpicking, but it is indeed the case. Those who have seen it will know that what I say is true. In all five acts, applause could be heard from the audience like thunder. Our director, Mr. Ying Yunwei (what kind of person he is, Mr. Wu Zhen introduced him in this column a few days ago, so there is no need for me to say more), could not help but dance when he heard the audience's enthusiastic applause. Under his happy emotions, he worked even harder to direct the actors and encourage them, and the actors became even more lively and vigorous. Ah, he is truly a great advocate of art, he is truly someone I admire.</p>
<p>Teasing Each Other with Jokes: There are many places in this play that can make people laugh their heads off. I think the funniest part is when Morocco (the ugliest face) says a series of foolish words when he proposes to Portia, such as "Don't dislike the color of my skin, it is the outer garment that hides the light," "This knife of mine has killed the kings and princes of Persia, and defeated the great Suleiman three times," "Speaking of family, talent, and appearance, I am worthy," and "Oh, bad luck, a skeleton!" Every time I hear these words, I can't help but laugh. The other actors have the same feeling. Therefore, when we are idle backstage, we tease each other with these jokes. Even now, when we meet our comrades and someone recites these words, we still can't help but laugh. May 28th, at Jinan University</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (1)(6)(4) by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 41: German Literature After Goethe</p>
<p>Around the same time as Liliencron and Dehmel, another school of poetry emerged in Vienna, consciously departing from the northern objective realism and gradually transforming all elements of life into bright, timeless beauty. Among this group of accomplished writers, three are particularly memorable: Stefan George, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Rainer Maria Rilke. George was a stern and flawless master; none of his works contain a flawed verse, nor any verses that are not imaginatively and philosophically deeply suggestive. Hofmannsthal, through his choice of dramatic forms and his collaboration with Richard Strauss, achieved international popularity for his group and school of works. However, translation has failed him; the completeness and brilliance, the mystery and magic of his poetry cannot be conveyed. Standing somewhat apart from these two is Rainer Maria Rilke, strict in form yet mystical, the master of all young Expressionist lyric poets born in the ancient capital of Prague. This is because he reconstructs the world from within, recasting it closer to his own refined, musical soul. In recent years, a storm and upheaval of new Expressionism has arisen around him, achieving the most solid accomplishments not only in novels or plays, but also in lyric poetry and philosophical poetry. Among these young contemporaries, at least one name is worth recording: Franz Werfel.</p>
<p>Modern drama, which arose after Holz's experiments and first gathered in the famous Free Stage Association in Berlin, is composed of a collection of works that are exceptional in scope, richness, complexity, and power, and has an international reputation. Hermann Sudermann, though deeply interesting, is not a great playwright. The two outstanding geniuses are Gerhart Hauptmann and Arthur Schnitzler.</p>
<p>Although Hauptmann achieved success with his grand style of poetic drama, such as "The Sunken Bell" and "Henry of Ofterdingen," his naturalist dramas are perhaps his greatest and most characteristic achievements. In plays such as "The Lonely Ones," "The Weavers," "The Beaver Coat," "Hannele's Himmelfahrt," "Michael Kramer," and "Rose Bernd," there is reality and a complete illusion. No words recorded in writing are more certain or more incisive. Secondly, there is a complete reversal of the mythological conception of human sin. The tragic sin in these plays lies within the universe or the human community, not within individual lives. The main characters in Hauptmann's plays are all suffering people; they are more accused than guilty. He is a sympathetic playwright, a representative poet of the industrial and social-minded era. His greatest achievement lies in the creation of characters. No existing writer has created a world filled with such active people, a world from which future generations can glimpse the life of an era or a country.</p>
<p>The Viennese Schnitzler is as realistic and precise as Hauptmann, but he expresses a complex society, a society dedicated to art, accustomed to self-reflection, slightly disillusioned, and feeling weary. He lacks Hauptmann's power, but possesses elegance, refinement, and gentleness. His finest plays, "Liebelei," "Fair Game," "The Vast Domain," and "The Lonely Way," have a combination of honesty, elegiac sadness, and spiritual enchantment. The same can be said of his stories, written in a clear, musical style.</p>
<p>In Germany, the novel lags behind lyric poetry. What hindered the novel was the late maturation of German prose, which only after Nietzsche acquired a modern simplicity, elegance, and documentary nature. Among many interesting and often capable novelists, Gustav Freytag, the recorder of North German peasant life, and Clara Viebig, equally well-known among the proletarians of Berlin and the fortunate children of the Rhine, achieved something close to international fame. Such fame will sooner or later also belong to Ricarda Huch, a scholar, poet, and novelist of artistic purity and imaginative depth, a woman of abundant talent. However, above all these stands two giants, not only of the novel but also of artistic prose: Thomas Mann and Jakob Wassermann.</p>
<p>Thomas Mann is an extremely rigorous writer. A long novel, "Buddenbrooks," and two volumes of short stories and novellas—not to mention his essays—these almost constitute his entire body of work. However, "Buddenbrooks," the story of the decline and fall of a Lübeck aristocratic family, is a vast and complete, splendid and clear work. The short stories and novellas, especially "Death in Venice," are works of unparalleled beauty and restraint. No one in this era has written prose nobler than his.</p>
<p>Wassermann, whose major work "The World's Illusion" was well-received by English readers, is a mystic with broad creative power, great enthusiasm, and prolonged development. He has a taste for fantasy and has always been compared to Dickens and Dostoevsky. Through long effort, he developed an eloquent poetic form and a style appropriate to expressing his enthusiastic view of things. Wassermann has some prophetic power in his blood. Like Schnitzler and Hauptmann, he is Jewish. His contrast with Thomas Mann, just like the contrast between Schnitzler and Hauptmann, illustrates the passion and agitation, the joy and the search for the divine that characterizes the works of many young contemporary German poets, playwrights, and novelists whose writing belongs to a future that is more promising than the present.</p>

<p>New Book Monthly Review</p>
<h3>Two Female Writers by Wang Tiran</h3>
<h3>The Female Juror</h3>
<p>By Ms. Zhang Wenjuan</p>
<p>Published by Guanghua Bookstore</p>
<p>We have "discovered" two female writers.</p>
<p>One's debut work is a collection of novels, the other's is a collection of poems. Although both are thin volumes, they can bring readers the joy of discovering a wonderful new realm. These two small books are certainly not entirely satisfactory, but it is very difficult to achieve such results with a debut work.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the collection of short stories, "The Female Juror." We simply have praise for this collection of novels, especially for the differences between this female writer and other female writers. The difference lies in the technique of writing novels. We all know that there are already several female writers who write novels, but their works are all the same, excelling in so-called "delicate psychological descriptions." And these so-called "delicate psychological descriptions" are mostly the psychology of these young ladies in the current period, casually written when they are in a state of "elegant inspiration." Therefore, they write not only in great detail, but also with a sense of reluctance to part. So they write about psychologies that don't need to be written, and they like to talk about things in detail that could be written more concisely. Therefore, most of the works of female writers are not economical, and the more delicate the psychological description, the less economical they are. As a result, the story is dull and the length is verbose. The result, in addition to being delicate, has no other advantages, and in addition to psychology, it has no other content. Naturally, this is also one of the natural phenomena in the world, because women are generally not very economical in their speech, and they pay more attention to their own lives. Therefore, it seems that there is no other way except to write a lot about themselves and their psychology. But the novel is a novel after all, it doesn't matter if a person is a little fat or thin, but they must have skin, flesh, and bones. If we write a novel so delicately that it is messy, with unclear features, it is like a person with only three bones, and the whole body is covered with meat. Not only is it paralyzed and unable to stand up, but it is simply half like a person and nine and a half like a ghost. So such novels are really incompletely developed freaks. Although they can be counted among novels, they can never be counted as perfect novels, and they are not worth holding up on our shoulders to parade everywhere. However, in fact, although female writers always like to produce some freakish works, in the eyes of gentlemen who have a liking for scabs, they are all celestial beauties and unprecedented masterpieces. Of course, we dare not say that female writers cannot produce good works. Heaven and earth are our consciences, we would never dare to say that. But, we feel that if they are willing to produce their works slowly, and at the time of creation, give more deliberation, more cutting, and at the same time pay more attention to the lives of others, we believe that they will definitely write better works. However, it seems that most of them are impatient to do so, so we always only have the blessing to see that kind of loosely structured and verbose novels.</p>
<p>This is originally the old temper of our "Chinese writers." When writing short stories, they must write them like a long novel, and they will never write them like a short story. When writing long novels, they must write them like several short stories, and they will never write them like a long novel. Although this method seems inappropriate, it is extremely clever, because only in this way can it be like this and like that. Therefore, as long as you write one thing, it can be like a long novel and like a short story, like a poem (the so-called "someone's novel is simply like a "poem" is also), like a theory, like a text, and like a leaflet. In this way, of course, it can be all-encompassing and can deal with everything.</p>
<p>But, also because there are few things that are like this and like that, such things are particularly valuable. The same is true of short stories. Precisely because there are few novels that are like short stories, we feel particularly happy when we see the several short stories in "The Female Juror." Indeed, the biggest feature of this collection of novels is that it gives us a real short story, and what we want to praise the author for is also this, that is, she is willing to write and can write a "real" short story.</p>
<p>The so-called "real short story" is a work that conforms to the laws of short stories. Such a work must have the elements of economy, compactness, and power. Here we do not want to discuss the definition of short stories, but we can say that if a short novel can tell us a single story, give us a clear impression, and after reading it, we feel satisfied with the characters, environment, plot, etc., then this work is undoubtedly a good short story. Several of the short stories in "The Female Juror" mostly meet this condition, so they are quite satisfying. These seven short stories are all centered on women. The protagonists of the stories are all women, so what is written is of course the lives and psychology of women. But there are many more places to write about life than to write about psychology, but we still clearly see the psychology of those female protagonists, and this is because the author knows how to use life and action to express psychology. This is a very skillful and powerful technique, and it is also a technique that must be adopted when writing short stories. Unfortunately, most of our female writers do not know this method, and only know how to "delicately" "describe psychology" ramblingly. According to the author's "Preface," she wants to "pick up this bald pen and write a few paragraphs about the suffering of our female compatriots, just enough to vent the boredom in my chest." Therefore, in the book, we can easily see this kind of female resistance, especially in "The Female Juror," "Old Woman Ma the School Supervisor," "The Female Beggar," etc., and the resistance mood in "The Female Juror" is especially direct and strong. But the personalities of the female protagonists in these three articles are all written very well, and their stories can also arouse the sympathy of the readers, so we feel that these three articles are the best in the whole book. Because the female juror did not accept the court's verdict that sentenced a woman who visited her husband in prison to death, she tried her best to rescue this woman. Her indignant, enthusiastic, resolute, and serious personality was vividly written by the valuer with some short sentences and simple facts, which is very touching to the readers. The article "Old Woman Ma" is written purely from an objective perspective about this strange female protagonist, writing about her appearance, her behavior, her personality, and her history, all of which are written deeply and clearly, giving the reader a deep impression, and grabbing the reader's attention from beginning to end. Technically, this novel is very commendable. The protagonist's thoughts are indeed a bit old, but she is still a very touching character. There is a description that says,</p>
<p>When she walks, she sticks out her chest, raises her head, and is full of spirit, like a strong man on the battlefield, if you cover up her two small feet.</p>
<p>When I went, she was sorting out books, she handled these books like handling cannonballs. (Page 64)</p>
<p>These two short sentences can very well show the author's flexible descriptive skills and keen observation. In addition, "The Female Beggar" writes about the simplicity and pity of women in rural areas with simple thoughts. "Ms. Xu Yin" writes about the spirit of sacrifice of knowledgeable women. "Blood Book" writes about the infatuation of men and the meanness of women, which on the one hand can arouse the reader's interest, and on the other hand can express the personality and life of various types of women, and has a very sincere tone. Only the protagonist of "A Woodcutter Woman," a modern woman who escaped into the deep mountains to live a primitive life because of the disillusionment of love and revolution, is quite like the fact of the novel, but it is written into a fact that makes people hard to believe, which is a relatively poor article.</p>
<p>After reading this article, we feel that the author seems to be very influenced by foreign novels, so although the structure of these articles is very natural and realistic, it is very similar to foreign novels. The descriptions in them also show the influence of foreign literature. But from a technical point of view, this phenomenon is commendable. Don't we introduce foreign literature because foreign literature can affect the quality and technology of our literary creation? Therefore, the more works like "The Female Juror" are produced, the better.</p>
<h3>Lake Breeze</h3>
<p>By Ms. Yu Yan</p>
<p>Published by Modern Bookstore</p>
<p>"Lake Breeze" is a collection of poems. In this era when the style of poetry is not flourishing and female writers only love to write novels, the sudden appearance of this debut collection of poems is indeed a noteworthy thing.</p>
<p>This collection of poems of ninety pages, including small poems, contains a total of more than forty poems. These poems are obviously the songs of a girl. Although there are also sorrows and feelings, these sorrows and feelings are also obviously "girlish." Gentle emotions, quiet and soft thoughts, and fresh words are not only fully feminine, but also shining with the brilliance of a girl's era. Poets are inherently sentimental, but the feelings of youthful poets are ultimately only bitter but not spicy. The author of "Lake Breeze" is no exception. Her melancholy and depressed feelings are certainly very vigorous, but there seems to be no deep sorrow in them. Therefore, we should rather say that these poems are phenomena of adolescence, full of rosy dreams of young men and women, who, after first coming into contact with the cold reality, often have a psychological reaction due to the shattering of illusions, that is, a melancholy and world-weary mood. But this kind of mood is completely different from the world-weary mood of the defeated soldier who is covered in wounds and has suffered many blows. The difference, to put it simply, is the difference between disappointment and despair. Young men and women immersed in rosy dreams, once they wake up and see only dirty black brambles, the shock and disappointment at this time is of course conceivable. But although disappointed, they still have lingering feelings for the world and are still attached to it. Therefore, the world-weary mood and pessimistic tone at this time, although quite gray, are not gloomy and terrible, as if on a sunny spring day, although black clouds suddenly cover the sky, there is still a vague sunlight revealing in between, so it is ultimately different from the dark night. The impression that our female poet gives us in "Lake Breeze" is also as if like this. The reason why those poems are full of dim words, melancholic tones, and pessimistic colors, but still do not go to the warm and lovely demeanor, lies in this.</p>
<p>The female poet's melancholy and depression are obviously very deep, so it is "touching the scene to generate sorrow" and "borrowing things to express feelings." Therefore, in "Spring Night Boating on West Lake," the moonlight and singing all stirred up the female poet's sadness, and thinking of the tour on the lake, she couldn't help but sigh:</p>
<p>A small boat,</p>
<p>aroused infinite sorrow,</p>
<p>When, ah, when,</p>
<p>will I get to visit here again. 丨 "To a Friend by the Lake"</p>
<p>In "Small Poems," we can more easily appreciate the poet's sensitivity and sadness. "Small Insects Under the Steps," she feels that they are "wailing." "Fallen Flowers in the Muddy Catkins" are "only able to recall the tenderness of spring." The skull in the sunset wilderness cemetery, she asks it "Were you a beauty in your previous life?" But some are like</p>
<p>The idle sorrow of green grass,</p>
<p>The remnant smile of roses,</p>
<p>Life has passed like this. 丨 "Small Poem" Two</p>
<p>The clouds blown by the gust,</p>
<p>It is just like people's hearts,</p>
<p>Shaking uncertainly. 丨 "Thoughts" Ten</p>
<p>But they are quite lovely small poems with quiet thoughts. Speaking of small poems, we feel that the most regrettable thing is that the female poet wrote too few small poems and too many "large" poems, the so-called "large" poems are those longer poems, such as "Intoxication," "A Broken Ship," "To Ms. SS," etc., because we feel that the poet is good at writing short poems but clumsy at writing long poems. This can be proved by long poems. Many long poems often only have a small part of the lines that really have poetic flavor. For example, the first only has "That gentle rising and falling sound of beating pulp, shattered the moonlight in the lake, broke through the loneliness of life," three lines are really poetry. The sixth "Night's Groan," only the first two sections are full of poetic flavor. The last section of "Moonlit Night with a Gentle Breeze" is good. "Envy" is also good in the last section. "Rainy Night" only needs the first section. The traces of old poetry in the last two sections are too deep. There are too many examples like this, so there are several poems, such as "Night's Groan," "In Sickness," "Night of Losing Heart," and the scenery-writing "Summer Night" "Seashore at Early Dawn," etc., although the whole article is lovely, there are only a few lines in several articles that are good. We feel that if the author uses a "contraction policy" on these poems and writes them into short poems of less than ten lines, wouldn't it be good? There are also several hundred poems that have too thick an old poetry flavor. Too many words such as "Tuan Fan," "Chàng Wàng," "Guan Shan," "Qing Hui," "Xiao Xiao," "Sa Sa," and "Li Ge" are used, which are a bit clichéd.</p>
