<p>真正的戀愛往往會演出慘痛的悲劇來</p>
<p>結婚時的快樂遠不如離婚時的快樂</p>
<p>女子以被男子壓迫爲辱而男子以被女子壓迫爲榮</p>
<p>如果學校當局禁絶學生情書往來則國文敎師行將無噉飯之地</p>
<p>在戀愛的漩渦裏好像盤桓於天堂地獄之間</p>
<p>你如果失敗一樁事只要你在失敗的原因上去奮鬥終能得到成功</p>
<p>在奮鬥前進的時候切不可顧後但達到目的之後却不可不顧後了</p>
<p>被社會輿論的攻擊而改變情調這完全不了解戀愛的真諦</p>

<p>夏暑困人長日難遣調冰剖瓜固足以少却炎威而精神上之倦疲實無法可以袪除愚固嗜影日惟觀影自遣海上影院有冷氣之設備者爲南京光陸兩院惟兩小時之勾留固甚涼爽而一出院門反益感暑氣之厲至夜間露天影戲則時間又不相宜聞電影院營業在暑期中每見衰减蓋莫不受天時之影響焉</p>
<p>然佳片出映欣賞之興終濃憶「賴婚」片二度開映時適亦盛夏然座上客滿雖汗流浹背而未覺其苦益以片中冰天雪地之景尤令人於無意中忘院外之炎陽而如置身影裏享清凉之福至今思之猶有餘味又如「淘金記」片余曾數度往觀去夏在北京開映時依然滿座於閧笑聲中一覩雪地之景方弗有凄冷荒凉的背景者否則觀大戰爭之片沙場之上砲火之下亦必如身歷其境而使人不耐耳</p>
<p>國産影片中近多打武之作劍影刀光縱極緊張然夏日觀之終覺不快聞明星影片公司近有長片「桃花湖」之攝製出自鄭正秋先生導演片中所述於哀惋中寓纒绵之情緒而曲折細膩尤勝於白雲塔梅花落諸片該片首集寫域外風光蓋以庫倫爲背景者萬里冰雪饒有詩意佈景之偉大實所罕覯聞片巳完成不日即可開映銀光雪影中當能一袪心頭之積暑也</p>
<p>憶Soreen　Play雜誌嘗刋一六月專號其中文字圖畫皆取材於電影明星夏季避暑之生活及電影片中冰雪之景一編在手爲忘午倦可知夏日觀影於影片之背景宜有考慮也</p>

<p>美政府爲維持棉價於去年設立農務局並組織美國棉業合作社農務局之事權曾誌本報合作社之内容如何殊值得注意據萬國棉業季報載美國即拉巴瑪州美棉合作社社長諾定頓氏著「美國棉業合作社」一文兹直譯如下以覘其内容美國棉業合作社乃棉業合作社之全國機關爲聯邦農務局所承認而其形式亦爲農務局所核准合作社額定資本三千萬元依照社章得爲其社員推銷機關之售棉總經理美國棉業合作社除密西西比州格林胡之標準棉合作社外皆爲社員而爲合作社所有成效之受益人兹爲便於分析起見合作社事業可分爲各不相同之三種</p>
<p>（第一）全國棉業合作社旣爲棉業合作員之集中機關故直接有推銷各支社所有棉花之　旣爲農務局以金融上合作施諸棉業合作之經理故有借欵與合作員以供下述用途之甲放債以維持巿面即由各州合作社於棉農繳棉之時借資於棉農是乙放債與各州合作社以供購置物質上便利之需用如收買貨棧打包廠軋花廠等是内放債與各州合作社以供認購物産借貸公司股票之需用但合作社未便借資與借貸公司作物産借貸之用途因此種欵項必須來自第三借貸機關或商業銀行也全國棉業合作社與各州合作社間之放債機關其範圍之大小須視其用欵之需要及各州合作社所能提交合作社社與農務局之擔保品而定全國合作社之事宜且將實現農務局關於植棉家銀行家商家間組織敎育合作及其他要舉爲整個的運動成功所必不可少者之政策此種事業其中有關係公共之要點一（一）擴張各州合作社之社員人數（二）努力使美國棉花之出産在額量上與世界需要相應合（三）改善美棉之品質以保持美棉産之優越地位並爲植棉家謀取與美棉品量相稱之可能的最高價格</p>
<p>（第二）美國棉業合作社將爲棉花之買賣無論何時如合作社及農務局當局以爲糾正棉帶任何地點所或有之錯誤起見或以爲此事極有益於社員則合作社將就各州分社全體所貢獻之容景買賣棉花換言之任何私人棉商得買賣國内或國外棉花或買賣現棉或期棉此種買賣權利美國棉業合作社固亦有之也凡操縱所製成或巾場不平均的多空地位所造成之巿况有糾正之必要時合作總社可在任何期貨市場交解或交割棉花合作社是否將行此事權而行使時將達何種程度則爲酌視當時情形再行决定之事也</p>
<p>（第二）美國棉業合作社之第一要務爲會同農務局而以法定之棉業維持社名義行事維持職務僅擬於事態緊迫巿况特殊供求與價格胥受影響時方行使之依照此條法制之規定總合作社可藉農務局金融助力在棉巿上購存棉花其額量無定至足可鞏固巿價而後止</p>
<p>如棉農必欲多間棉田多收棉産則農務局當然不能永遠保護價格即欲維持相當的長久時期亦有所未能此固事理之易明者也若氣候非常良好棉作非常順利而每畝收量異常豐厚則農務局在此環境之下定可扶助棉農不使之因棉收豐裕而臻於破産並及售權人之地位但若棉田畝數竟超過保守理由之外致收獲異常豐盛則農務早巳警告棉農設遇此種事態該局在經濟上將愛莫能助矣限制過剩種前較易爲力事後則難措手有識者類能知之是以農務局與合作社此時　請植棉者及與南方棉業有關係者與之合作以減少種棉而積同時此兩機關又請求植棉人等就南方植棉各區之可能性出産優質棉花蓋以此舉不獨關係一九三○年之棉作價值即將來棉作價值之高下與夫一般棉業之盛衰亦唯此是繫也現所求於全國棉業中人者爲互相團結成爲整個有組織的南方以出産棉花其量其質務須最適合世界之需要並用一種方法銷售其出品務獲與世界商業狀况及棉花供給相適合之可能的最高售價云（農）</p>

<h3 id="c294">黑人的音樂 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 楊昌溪</p>
<p>黑人在音樂上的貢獻底範圍更比詩歌和小說給予世界的力量較大非惟他們給予美國音樂的尼格羅人底血搆成了美國近代的Jazz而且他們還以尼格羅民族底血向美國以外的國家貫注音樂上的尼格羅民族的血是帶着粗野的陶醉的導誘人類走向野蠻性的這種濃厚的氣氛巳經使歐美的人們爲之征服了</p>
<p>所以我們論斷近代美國的音樂乃至美國的文明我們都不能抛棄黑人的功績更是我們不能忘掉那搆成美國近代文明的Jazz是黑人民族征服美國音樂乃至文化的特别表徵雖然Jazz只是亞非利加洲黑人言語中含着混雜意思的一個字但是自從一九一九年從荷蘭船上載着的黑奴們輸入美國後在Jazz内横流着的黑人民族底强悍生活力是永没有變更雖然在形式上稍有變化但根本上還擺脫不了黑人民族的血在Jazz底本質上有三分之一是黑人民族的血有三分之一是通常中等階級的美國理想和感情有三分之一是「機械時代」（Macbineage）的精神因此Jazz從亞非利加到美國全部却爲他征服了這征服了一億以上的美國人的Jazz作了美國的國民藝術使美國因爲有了Jazz而搆成了她的魂她的國民音樂雖然許多人認爲這黑人民族底血搆成的Jazz不能成爲藝術不能永遠的存留但被認爲Jazz之王的保羅惠特曼（PaulWhitman）却認爲只要他能訴諸人羣大衆觸到人生的深處牠不容易在這個正熱烈的歡迎牠的時代下消滅何况牠並不是從歐洲傳來也不是從智識的藝術的宫裏産生出來的而牠是從大衆的情緒生出來的産兒自然牠能超過是否藝術的估量而永遠的長存所以在聆着Jazz的時候因爲律動自然情緒的陶鎔使人在舞蹈中忘懷了人世的束縛對美國的機械文明作了有力的抗議</p>
<p>除了由黑人民族的血搆成的Jazz而外黑人的音樂在美國聞名時是開始於一八七一年自從黑人的學生歌團作了一度演奏後他們便爲美國人所認識了由此他們因爲有機會享受敎育的關係使他們把原有的黑人民族的音樂天才慢的指揮出來了</p>
<p>第一個能在音樂中注入黑人民族的血而且自詡的音樂家是色特喬治（Ch</p>
<p>valierSainGeorge1755-1799)他是哥色克(Gosse)底學生爲凡雅林和歌團寫二個樂譜在法國也很有名同樣與貝多芬爲友的布勒吉道耳（AugustBridgetower)也在歌曲中讚詡着黑人民族的血這兩人同得得（EdmuedDede）和準提(JowephWhite)特倫(SauiuelColeridgeTaylor)都是在歐洲聞名的音樂家但是在美國的黑人音樂家有的充任禮拜堂的唱詩者有的在一個歌團中服務而不能完全代表黑人全部的音樂那自然也談不到把他們民族的血貫入了所以在過去八年或十年中黑人的作曲家只有獨唱歌曲凡雅林獨唱曲混和的合唱曲笛曲而唱歌家的成積巳只限於一種禮拜堂或附屬的團體音樂演奏家只有柏里（HaiyTBuileigh）曾在英王和皇后及普魯士公子瑞典公爵前演奏過得悉了國際的聲譽其他的反便没有如何偉大的音樂家</p>
<p>但是黑人的作曲家却是一年一年的銳進非惟想在美國文學中放着異彩而且他們還是如小說家或詩人在作品中表現黑人生活及民族意識的喚醒把他們的血貫入樂譜中使的特質永遠的征服美國人的國民音樂而且美國北部的工業區域内的黑人作曲家認爲南方的黑人生活很可以作爲新旋律的基調巳經聯合南方的作曲家詩人努力的表現南方農業區域下的黑人生活目的在使全美國的黑人身中在民族覺醒的音樂下使這越超於小說的感動力的非樂能伴着黑人的詩歌中的民族意識日見的發揚光大這樣黑人在音樂和詩歌方面又入了一個新曙光期我們且期待着新的光輝的開展罷</p>

<p>倍克塔須（Bektash）敎底詩人們最近也成爲土耳其文壇上的人物了這是因爲薩台丁奴洒（SadettinNonzhel）新近搜集了這些詩人底名作印成了一大本按倍克塔須敎本是回敎底一個支派不過是和正統派的回敎相對立的而且彼此視如仇敵所以這個敎派的敎派的敎徒做了許多詩歌故事竭力地挖苦取笑他們所反對的正敎因爲他們是在正敎底壓迫之下的所以這些作品都是在暗下傳佈這個敎派底創始者是哈依倍克塔須（HadjiBektash）據說他會做過許多奇蹟這些奇蹟的故事在民間流傳着以前曾有德文的譯本和舊土耳其文的小册子這些故事或詩歌都帶着一種波斯風味和拜火敎（Zorastrianism）氣息</p>
<p>發特貝</p>
<p>(EuadBeg)土耳其的民俗學家正在搜集着土耳其底民間文學土耳其本是擁有豐富的民間文學的但是以前土耳其人多不加注意只有德國人却研究得非常詳盡最近才有土耳其的司單部爾大學着眼到這一方面專門有一部份人來做這一件工作主持其事的就是發特貝此外格洛司（Gross）譯出了一些倍克塔須底故事　基衰（Gizeh）和如志爾（Mintzel)搜集着神仙故事巴台蓋西(BattaiGazi）在古代防守巴格達底邊疆阻止皮山丁人之侵入的是土耳其傳說中的大英雄在土耳其底舊文學裏有不少歌頌他的詩這些詩都是民族意識非常强烈民族精神充分表現的可惜這些詩還没有一個新詩人來譯成新土耳其文字</p>
<p>兒童用書</p>

<p>(1) The late General Wang Zhixiang, during the Xinhai Restoration Revolution, advocated righteousness in western Guangdong, leading troops to assist Hubei in supporting the Republic. When Yuan Shikai seized power, the late General maintained his integrity and retreated, preserving his great moral character. In recent years, when the army pacified Beiping, he was able to maintain local order and remain loyal to his homeland. Hearing of his passing, the government is deeply saddened. Wang Zhixiang should be handed over to the Executive Yuan for deliberation and compensation according to regulations, to be submitted for approval, to demonstrate the government's sincere remembrance of meritorious veterans. This order. (2) Zhao Tieqiao, a commissioner of the Construction Committee and specialist of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was specially appointed for his long-standing meritorious service to the Party and the nation. Since taking over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has diligently managed the company, not avoiding hardship, and has streamlined shipping services, facilitating transportation and benefiting military operations, demonstrating his loyalty and dedication. He was attacked by thugs and died. The government deeply laments his passing. Zhao Tieqiao should be handed over to the Executive Yuan for generous deliberation and compensation, to be submitted for approval, and the Yuan should instruct local military and police officials to strictly apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice, to honor his contributions and punish the perpetrators. This order. (3) Adjutant General He Yaozu reported that Zhang Xiqian, concurrently Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies, reported that Li Xiangxian, Chief of the Second Section of the Bureau, is wanted and requested to be dismissed. This is approved. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Labor Supply Exceeds Demand <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Straits Settlements have banned the entry of Chinese laborers due to an oversupply of labor. In reality, the so-called oversupply of labor is not due to an abundance of genuine laborers, but rather because the development of machinery has reduced the need for workers. I have repeatedly stated that if the methods of global industry and commerce are advanced rashly, global industry and commerce will inevitably face destruction. Why? The reason merchants can profit is that they must produce large quantities at low costs. Therefore, factories in various countries must strive to develop machinery to produce goods more quickly, better, and in greater quantities while requiring fewer and better workers. If this principle is followed in competition, the result will inevitably be an abundance of goods and an abundance of unemployed workers in the world. With goods abounding and the number of people with purchasing power limited and diminishing, how can commerce avoid daily decline? As commerce declines, factories will inevitably reduce production. As factory production decreases, the number of unemployed workers in the world will inevitably increase. Not only will those in the future be unable to find work, but even those who already have work are constantly at risk of being laid off. Therefore, it is said that the number of unemployed workers will inevitably abound in the world. Now, the Straits Settlements want to remedy the problem of labor oversupply by banning the import of Chinese laborers. This is only a temporary measure and not a fundamental solution. What will be done in the future when the workers of all countries are facing an oversupply?</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign telegrams reported that the commerce of the five major industrial nations has seen a large decrease. This is a natural trend and is not surprising.</p>

Then the reporter Guan Yixian represented a speech bearing expanded meeting invitation comrades felt glad. Later a reporter asked Xie, besides war, does the solution to the current situation have peaceful methods? Does the meeting's advocacy still take martial force? Xie answered now that the war is holding the line between the two sides, holding one day more, the people's pain is one day more. As for the meeting's future work, it plans to establish a national assembly preparatory office and draft a provisional law, promulgating freedom of speech, body, etc., and will make definite regulations.

After the oath was completed, Tan delivered a speech saying that the comrades have served in this government for a long time and have been able to work hard, which is very gratifying. Among them, there are quite a few who followed the Prime Minister and shared hardships and are now working in this government. Today's supplementary oath is just a formality, but its significance is very important. Now that the war on the front lines has not been resolved and the communist party in the rear has risen up to cause trouble, it is the time for our comrades to strive and fight. Today, I hope that the comrades will inherit the Prime Minister's teachings, embrace the determination to fight, and work together to help the soldiers on the front lines quickly quell the rebellion and stabilize the rear, so that the jumping clowns will be in awe and the foundation of the government will be more solid. Next, Wang Zhengting gave a brief speech, saying that the meaning of the oath is nominally a formality, but after careful study, it has a profound meaning. During the Tongmenghui era, all members were required to swear to the heavens, negatively responsible for joining the alliance, working without corruption or deterioration, and positively implementing the party and national policies. The Prime Minister's revolutionary goal was to build a good environment and build a new country, seeking equality between nations and enabling the people to live in peace and prosperity. Now that the soldiers on the front lines are fighting hard against the enemy in the heat, our comrades in the rear should follow the Prime Minister's teachings and strive to complete construction. After the speech, they took photos and dispersed. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>Although the Rouen textile labor unrest is expected to be resolved soon because the employers have agreed to increase wages by 6%, the situation in various parts of northern France is deteriorating daily. Currently, the number of strikers has reached 130,000. If a general strike is declared on Monday, it is feared that it will increase to 300,000. At the same time, the Labor Confederation issued a statement denying that the labor unrest was due to opposition to the new insurance law, saying that its purpose was to seek wage increases to cope with the continuing rise in the cost of living. However, the employers refused to meet with the Labor Confederation and union representatives, wanting the workers to surrender unconditionally. Therefore, the situation has become more serious. Moreover, the Labor Confederation is not a communist organization but a socialist one and is under the control of conservative elements.</p>

<p>British and Polish Competition Fierce in Northern European Coal Sales</p>
<p>Almost the Entire Market Falls into the Hands of Polish Merchants</p>
<h3 id="e95">Guomin News Agency, Warsaw, 3rd <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recently, British and Polish coal merchants have been competing fiercely in the Scandinavian market. Economic and political circles here are paying close attention. According to the agreement reached between the coal merchants of the two countries in January this year on establishing a concrete contract for the sale of coal in the region, but no result has come to date. The low depreciation of Polish coal is already below the cost of British coal, resulting in almost the entire market falling into the hands of Polish merchants. According to a recent publication, out of 30,000 tons of coal used by the Finnish national railways, only 5,000 tons were purchased from Britain, and the rest were purchased from Poland. In addition, only 2,000 tons of the 178,000 tons of coal used by the Swedish state railways were purchased from Scottish coal mines. The reason is partly because the Polish currency exchange rate is cheaper and partly because the Polish government has reduced railway transportation costs to a minimum to encourage it.</p>

<p>Europe's Recent</p>
<p>Population Productivity (Continued from Yesterday)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Russia <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Europe has always regarded Soviet Russia as having the highest mortality rate.</p>
<p>In 1928, there were 42 births per 1,000 people and 18 deaths. As a result, the natural increase was 3.5 million people. Government doctors provide free birth control education to members of various labor unions and other people deemed valuable and do not charge fees. Once a woman has been diagnosed as pregnant and wishes to have an abortion, the National Committee may approve it. However, there are many drawbacks, which are beyond the government's expectations. Although the government has adopted a lenient policy on birth control, the result has been to encourage increased production. Female workers receive full pay for two months of rest before and after childbirth, and large factories have nursing rooms to care for infants while mothers work. According to the current population productivity rate, Soviet Russia will have 300 million people by 1960.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Hungary <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Although the current population of Hungary is already so large that the country cannot support it, people in the church are still worried about the decline in productivity. The government is now providing various well-equipped hospitals and clinics, providing free milk and subsidizing medical expenses to reduce the burden on families with children.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Poland <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The country's productivity is increasing day by day, becoming a burden. The productivity of Poland in the five years before the European War ranked first in Europe. At that time, only Russia and the countries of Central Europe could compete. Currently, the productivity is 34 people per thousand, and the number of marriages is gradually decreasing.</p>

<p>The country's productivity is declining very rapidly, but there is no way to stop it from continuing to decline. In 1880, the productivity rate was 311 people per 10,000, but in 1927 it had dropped to 41%. Relief measures have established organizations that lend money interest-free to those with children. The government subsidizes children's education organizations, and government employees with families receive slightly better salaries and lower travel expenses. These are all efforts by the country's government to encourage national productivity. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Japanese rural areas are extremely exhausted, and the voice of relieving rural areas is overflowing throughout the country. The Seiyukai Economic Investigation Association is taking the opportunity to take action. Rural-born members of the government and party are also gradually expressing dissatisfaction with the government's austerity policy. This kind of dissatisfaction has not yet appeared on the surface but seems to be gradually increasing. The relief policies planned by the party are as follows: (1) Maintain rice and cocoon prices (2) Reduce the burden on rural areas (3) Improve the policy of distributing fertilizers (4) Improve rural finance (5) Encourage side businesses.</p>

<p>No sector in Japan is unaffected by the recession, especially the railways, which account for the largest part of the country's income. The period for compiling the budget is approaching, but the recent decrease in railway income is unprecedented. The average monthly income is 4 million yuan less than last year. It is difficult to compile next year's budget from this development.</p>

<p>Based on the current situation, the revenue for the 6th year of Showa will be at least 123 million yuan less than the 5th year's actual budget, approximately 1,423 million yuan. The difference between the budget estimate and the righteous output is 145 million yuan. In addition, although new requests are not recognized, there are approximately 34 million yuan in expenditures that naturally increase due to legal regulations and special circumstances. Therefore, the difficulty in compiling the budget is unprecedented.</p>

<p>Central and National Government Commemoration Week</p>
<h3 id="e111">Central Party Headquarters <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on the 4th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 71st Commemoration Week for the Premier in the auditorium. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Enke Batu, Ke Xing'e, Miao Peicheng, and staff members from various departments, offices, and guests, totaling approximately 500-600 people, attended. Chairman Dai Chuanxian conducted the ceremony and reported that the country was unfortunately beset by troubles: on the military front, the suppression of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang had not yet ended; on the international front, Russia disregarded public reason and used various methods to prevent China's diplomacy from proceeding smoothly; on the security front, the Communist Party took advantage of the northward march of the Hunan Provincial troops to suppress the rebellion and captured Changsha, committing arson, murder, kidnapping, and looting without restraint; on the social front, labor-management disputes and other problems often presented a state of unrest. As for the Beiping area, various anti-revolutionary factions were mixed together in a group like maggots in a garbage can, clinging to carrion and seeking only to satisfy their personal desires, disregarding the interests of the country and the nation. Wang Jingwei, claiming to be a leader, called on reactionary elements to destroy the central government with unreasonable arguments, covering up his crimes of violating the party constitution and interfering with party discipline. Regarding the Changsha incident, although it cannot be determined that it has a significant relationship with him, it happened suddenly, neither sooner nor later, when Zhang Guitai's forces were exhausted and Beiping was carrying out reaction, proving that Zhang Fakui and Huang Qixiang had previously caused disaster in Guangdong. At least there is a suspicion of using the Red Peril to seek cyclical revenge. I remember a few years ago, Wang had satirical words about our comrades, saying that there are two types of people in the world: (1) those who are like livestock, forced to carry heavy objects beyond their muscular strength, and fall halfway because they cannot bear the burden; (2) those who are like walking on a narrow road full of mud, not knowing how to avoid left and right, resulting in soiled clothes and shoes. This was a mockery of our hardworking comrades as stupid people who do not know how to speculate and seek advantages. Those who knew early on knew that he had lost his integrity. Now, observing his words and actions in Beiping, he has become even more depraved. His personal history violates the hopes of party comrades and the people of the whole country, which is extremely regrettable. If Wang does not realize that using the Communist Party is a good strategy, not only will the whole country suffer the Red Peril in the future, but the crime will be on his own, and the Communist Party's viper-like nature will eventually become a disaster for those who use them, and it will be too late for regrets. The central government's military campaign to suppress the rebellion is progressing, and victory is very certain. The so-called expanded meeting is nothing more than a flash in the pan, and the result will inevitably be a disgrace and failure, unable to stand in the country and after it has fallen. It is even more heartbreaking that the Russians' past oppression of China was actually using China's insufficient unified strength, so they were so arrogant. Now they are actually meeting the will of others and fueling their red flames to destroy unity and make enemies happy, which is tantamount to being a tiger's henchman. The people of the country will not know where to die. Our comrades must endure hardship and strive for unity and construction, consolidate the foundation of the Kuomintang, and eliminate all reactionary forces to restore domestic order and create powerful diplomacy. Industrial organizations must know that Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises, whether state-owned or private, are under the pressure of foreign forces, and they must have sound self-organization and harmonious will to make progress. Moreover, in recent times, countless people in society have no jobs and are crying from hunger and cold. Although the wages of general workers may not be satisfactory due to the rising cost of living, they are much stronger than the poor without jobs. They should be very patient and should not cause disturbances because of seeking small benefits and arguing over small matters. For all issues between labor and management, major issues should be reduced to minor issues, and minor issues should be resolved without incident. In particular, it is absolutely impermissible to strike or strike in order to destroy one's own industry and cause damage to oneself and society. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Nanchang Communications, Communist bandits Zhu and Mao, after capturing Gaoan, advanced towards Nanchang, hoping to achieve their aim. Commander Zhang Huizan of the 18th Division, in order to lure the enemy deep so as to annihilate them in one fell swoop, specially concentrated the Dai, Wang, and Zhu brigades near Nanchang City and around the Niu Xing Railway Station. All had fortifications built, with very thorough arrangements. Zhu and Mao did not fear death and advanced from Gaoan on the 30th of last month to Shengmi Town, 30 miles from the province, hoping to cross the river. The Xunyang warship opened fire and bombarded them, killing dozens of bandits. The Communist bandits who attacked the Niu Xing Railway Station also sneaked to the Fanjia Mountain area, 20 miles from the province, and were defeated by the sentries at Changtou Ling. Commander Lu has already completed the deployment of various departments. The large army and planes sent by the central government will also arrive soon, and a large-scale siege is planned within days. The Martial Law Command, in order to consolidate the security of the city, has sent teams to check in sections day and night and strictly prohibits the creation of rumors. Yesterday, Lan Zhaolian, a person who created rumors and confused the masses, was executed on the river bank of Zhongshan Road.

(2) The Zhu Mao bandits sneaked to Gaoan and on the 30th night, a part sneaked to Shengmi Town and were repelled by our Xunyang warship bombardment to the area west of Wuliting, killing more than ten bandits. Another part sneaked to the Luojia Mountain area and were fired upon by our sentries, causing the bandits to collapse for more than ten miles. There was a speech at a meeting in Gaoan that said, "As long as we get to Nanchang or Jiujiang, everyone can make a fortune," which proves that the bandits never forget plundering and that our army has now completed its concentration and will advance to suppress them within days. (3) The bandits who disturbed Gaoan and Fengxin are being concentrated by our army and will be suppressed in one fell swoop within days, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop. (4) The central government attaches great importance to the bandit communists in this province. In addition to sending a regiment from Jing (4th dispatch) to Xun that can arrive in Xun immediately, there are also large armies coming to Gan from Hankou to assist in the suppression. (5) Director He of Hankou telegraphed that in addition to ordering Li Baobing's division to open Xun, he also urged Commander Guo Rutong to transfer a regiment to Xun for defense.

<h3 id="e116">Navy Sends Ships to Changsha to Suppress Communists <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>After the Changsha Incident, the Navy Ministry immediately dispatched ships to assist the army in suppressing the communists. The Navy's office in Hankou received the following reports from the ships that went to Hunan yesterday: (1) The Yongsheng ship reported that the ship patrolled to Sancha Island at 6:00 p.m. on the 1st and found that the Red Army still occupied Changsha. There were no army people here, and the people greatly hoped for our navy to come. The ship reluctantly crossed the line and reached Changsha. The Red Army fired at our ship, and after a fierce attack for one hour, the bandit forces were unable to support it and fled to the edge of the city. The ship docked nearby that night and will give another painful suppression the next morning to recover Changsha. I hope that the army will come to take over the defense. (2) The Chuguan ship reported that the ship arrived in Qichun on the 29th and immediately went to suppress the Communist bandits at Huangsangkou at noon, destroying their nests and killing many bandits. At 10:00 p.m. that night, I received an urgent telegram from the Wuxue Chamber of Commerce and returned to Wuxue. The next day, I went to Huangsangkou to patrol and saw that the Red Army flag was still erected there, and the bandits were still extremely stubborn. The ship destroyed many nests, and the bandits hid inland. It was found that Huangsangkou was designated to be defended by Han Shijie's newly compiled independent brigade. There must be cooperation between the army and our army to annihilate them. Please ask Director He to order Han's department to send a team to assist in the suppression to clear it as soon as possible. (3) The Xianning ship reported that the ship arrived at Sancha Island on the afternoon of the 2nd. It was reported that there were still no army entering the city to take over the defense today. A small number of Communist bandits have re-entered the city, and the rest are watching outside the city. Today, the deputy chief of staff of the 15th Division transferred from Yiyang to Xiangyin and said that the troops could occupy the provincial capital in separate ways within days. A brigade was approaching from Ningxiang, Wang's brigade was departing from Xiangyin, and the troops stationed in Qinggang were also departing to the province in preparation for crossing the river into the city within days. The ship immediately moved up to suppress the bandits based on the report.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Measures for Reorganizing Mining Areas in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, noting that many mining areas approved for exploration and mining within the province have been delayed in starting operations or abandoned midway, and that failure to address this would hinder entrepreneurs, has formulated seven articles outlining measures for reorganizing old mining areas. These articles have been submitted to the Provincial Committee for discussion and have been approved. The measures are recorded below: (Article 1) For all mining areas within Zhejiang Province that were approved for exploration and mining before June of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Department will notify the mining rights holders, giving them three months from the specified date to submit outstanding mining taxes to the Department and submit their mining licenses for verification. When submitting outstanding mining taxes, mining rights holders should also pay the current term’s mining tax. (Article 2) The specified date in the preceding article should be announced using one of the following methods: 1. Public announcement in newspapers; 2. Notification by the Department to the county governments for announcement. (Article 3) Mining rights holders who submit their mining taxes and licenses to the Department within the deadline will have their licenses verified, stamped with a verification mark, and returned to the mining rights holders for collection. (Article 4) If a mining rights holder is unable to pay taxes and have their license verified within the deadline due to special circumstances, they may submit a written explanation and request an extension, but the extension shall not exceed one month. (Article 5) If a mining rights holder fails to pay taxes and have their license verified by the deadline, and does not request an extension, or requests an extension but still fails to pay taxes and have their license verified after the extension expires, the Department will pursue the outstanding taxes and request the Provincial Government to forward a request to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to cancel their mining license. (Article 6) After this reorganization, the Department will continue to investigate mining areas at any time. If any of the following circumstances are found, or if there is any violation of mining regulations regarding the cancellation of mining rights, the Department will request the Provincial Government to forward a request to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to cancel their mining license: 1. Failure to pay mining taxes by the deadline; 2. Delay in starting operations for more than one year without proper justification, or cessation of work midway for more than one year. (Article 7) These measures will be implemented after being approved by the Provincial Government and reported to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining for record.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Anhui Province to Launch Large-Scale Bandit Suppression <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The entire province is divided into seven zones.</p>
<p>A two-month deadline to eliminate bandits</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Anhui Province has suffered from military conflicts in recent years, leading to the rise of brigands and opportunists, with Communist elements among them. Virtually no area in Anhui is untouched by these problems, causing immense suffering to the people. Since assuming the position of Bandit Suppression Commander for the entire province, Wei Li-Huang has made it his mission to eliminate bandits and Communists. Recently, a conference was held in Bengbu to devise concrete measures for suppressing bandits and Communists. For the convenience of suppression, the province has been divided into seven bandit suppression zones based on the situation and military strength. A commander has been assigned to each zone, and simultaneous searches will begin on the 10th of this month, with a deadline of two months to completely eliminate bandits and Communists throughout the province. The zoning plan and the latest bandit situation are briefly described below.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Bandit Suppression Zones <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The area east of the Jinpu Railway is designated as the First Zone, commanded by Ge Wucheng, Brigade Commander of the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division. The area west of the Jinpu Railway, north of and including Shouxian and Huoqiuxian, is designated as the Second Zone, commanded by Liu Zixin, Regiment Commander of the 270th Regiment of the 45th Division. The area west of the Jinpu Railway, south of and including Hefei, Lujiang, and Wuwei, is designated as the Third Zone, commanded by Song Shike, Commander of the 3rd Detachment. The area including Luan, Huoshan, and Yingshan is designated as the Fourth Zone, commanded by Pan Shanzhai, Brigade Commander of the Newly Organized 5th Brigade. The area including Shucheng, Tongcheng, Huaining, Qianshan, Taihu, and Susong Wangjiang is designated as the Fifth Zone, commanded by Tang Yunshan, Brigade Commander of the 15th Independent Brigade. The area south of the Yangtze River, including Guichi, Qingyang, Jingxian, and Ningguo, is designated as the Sixth Zone, commanded by Lü Xueshu, Regiment Commander of the Capital Garrison Regiment. The area south of and including Dongliu, Qiupu, Shidai, Taiping, and Jingde is designated as the Seventh Zone; the commander has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Bandit-Communist Situation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The areas with the most widespread and rampant bandit activity in Anhui Province are the Communist bandit zones of northern Anhui, including Yingshan, Huoshan, Luan, Suxian, and Boxian. Gao Weiqi's band has over a thousand guns. The bandits led by Jiang Guochang (also known as "Three Legs") in the areas between Chuxian, Lai'an, Jiayou, Sixian, Dingyuan, and Quanjiao number between seven and eight hundred, with their lairs located in the old Jiashan and Ma'anshan mountains and the reed marshes of Hongze Lake and Laowushan. They have recently been defeated by the 2nd Cavalry Division. Furthermore, the Henan bandit group led by Li Kebang, operating between Yingshang, Huoqiu, Fuyang, and Taihe, is also being incorporated into Ye Kaixin's army and moving west to suppress rebellion. In addition, there are many accumulated bandits and discharged soldiers gathered in the areas bordering Shouxian, Hefei, Shucheng, and Luan. The remaining forces of Bao Peng, operating between Guichi, Shidai, Qimen, and Dongliu Guichi, number around three or four hundred. There are also two or three hundred bandits in the Wuhuashan mountains between Nanling and Fanchang, and three or four hundred bandits in the Danyang Lake and nearby mountains between Dangtu, Langxi, and Gaochun. Ding Wenlin's bandit group in the eastern part of Tongcheng numbers around three hundred, all possessing firearms. (August 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e125">Guangdong Province Meixian District Pacifying Refugees <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Hundreds of villages in the upper reaches of the Mei River in Meixian County, from Changsha Xu to Shekeng, have been occupied by Communist bandits and turned into bandit zones. In July, military police supervised refugees who had been displaced to other areas to return to their villages to harvest the rice from the bandit zones. The harvest is now complete, and all the grain has been transported to Meicheng to be sold to fund police expenses. However, the early rice has already been harvested, and there is no one to transplant and sow the late rice, making the autumn harvest hopeless. The county's police guard battalion held a joint conference and decided to order the people in the bandit zones to quickly transplant rice as a plan to pacify the refugees. The submitted document roughly states: "In the second joint conference of the County Police Committee, Commissioner Ye Shaolan proposed a plan regarding how to allocate the fields in the various bandit zones and transplant rice in the winter to maintain the people's food supply. The reason for this is that the fields in the bandit zones have already been harvested by the military and police, and autumn will soon pass, making it difficult to plant crops. If refugees return to their villages to organize, there may be no seeds to transplant. Having suffered from banditry and famine, it is inevitable that the refugees will turn into vagrants, making it difficult to suppress bandits and even more difficult to pacify the refugees. The plan is as follows: (1) While harvesting the fields in the bandit zones, the districts and townships should be responsible for recruiting and pacifying refugees to return to their villages and earnestly supervise the people in those areas to allocate and transplant rice. If it is impossible to allocate and transplant rice in certain bandit zones, the nearby districts and townships should draw up detailed maps and submit them to the county for clearance by the end of July. (2) If there is a fear of bandit harassment for those who transplant rice in the designated bandit zone fields, the nearby districts and townships should send police or request assistance from the defense forces for protection. (3) After the early season fields are harvested, if the landowners do not continue to work the fields, it will be considered a voluntary abandonment, and the districts and townships will allocate the fields to nearby good citizens for transplantation. (4) The joint conference should submit a document to the county, which will then be forwarded to Brigade Commander Zhang to allocate subsidies from the bandit field grain funds for transplantation expenses. (5) Once bandit fields or civilian properties are allocated to nearby good citizens for transplantation, all the grain should belong to the good citizens for their enjoyment, and the government should keep records and report, and order the nearby districts and townships to earnestly implement the plan as a warning to those who abandon their fields." The county, based on this, believes that the food problem is of utmost importance to the people's livelihood, and the separate transplantation of winter crops in the various bandit zones should not be delayed. In addition to ordering the nearby districts and townships to earnestly implement the plan, a public notice was issued yesterday to inform all nearby residents of the various bandit zones.</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: The municipal government received an instruction yesterday from the Guangdong Anti-Opium Bureau, stating that the Guangdong Provincial Unified Distribution Anti-Opium Drug Company, which is responsible for the unified distribution of anti-opium drugs throughout Guangdong Province, shipped seventy-six boxes of anti-opium drugs affixed with tax stamps, weighing 62,027 taels, on the Tongshun transport ship on the 19th of this month from the provincial capital to the Shantou Chao-Mei distribution office for sale. You are to be informed and to inform your subordinates accordingly. The municipal government, upon receiving this instruction, immediately ordered the Director of the Public Security Bureau to notify his subordinates. The ship carrying the large shipment of opium arrived in Shantou yesterday morning, the 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Liaoning Province Pawnshops Borrow Fifty Thousand Dollars <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: According to successive statements from pawnshops throughout the province to the Provincial Pawnshop Guild, the current financial stagnation and economic downturn have made life difficult for the general populace, who rely solely on pawnshops for assistance. As a result, pawnshops are receiving less money each day than they are lending out. Without sufficient reserves, they will be unable to maintain the current situation and will inevitably have to refuse to accept items for pawn or allow redemption, causing panic among the people and instability in the market. This situation is entirely due to the banks' restrictions on loans. The Guild has requested that the Liaoning Chamber of Commerce Federation contact the banking consortium to arrange for a loan of one million dollars to provide assistance. The Chamber of Commerce Federation sent a letter to the Provincial Government through the Commerce Federation, requesting that the banks be instructed to provide assistance. The Provincial Government then issued an instruction stating that the request from the Provincial Pawnshop Guild for the banking consortium to provide a loan of one million dollars to assist pawnshops had been forwarded to the Official Bank for joint discussion and response by the banks. The Official Bank has replied that it has recently extended loans to merchants in various counties, with a significant portion being borrowed by pawnshops. It is currently planning to establish more pawnshops in various counties, requiring even more capital. It is difficult to handle this loan request, but it is inappropriate to refuse entirely, given the need to maintain the market and assist the poor. After convening a meeting with the Frontier Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, it was agreed that it would be insufficient to provide the full amount requested. It was proposed that the four banks jointly provide 500,000 dollars in silver based on secured loan procedures. The Frontier Bank and the Official Bank would each provide 150,000 dollars, while the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications would each provide 100,000 dollars. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications would be responsible for lending to pawnshops in the provincial capital, while the Frontier Bank would be responsible for lending to pawnshops in counties where it has branches, and the Official Bank would be responsible for the rest. It is believed that this arrangement, when combined with previous loans, would be sufficient to maintain the market, as the amount would be close to the originally requested one million dollars. The Provincial Government has approved this instruction and ordered the Chamber of Commerce Federation to notify the pawnshops. (July 30th)</p>
<p>Preliminary Points Regarding the Civil Code: Inheritance and Family Sections (Continued)</p>
<h3 id="e128">Review Opinions of the Central Political Council <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>(II) Community Property System: The distinguishing feature of this system is the establishment of a form of joint property for spouses, with each spouse also allowed to have separate property in addition to the joint property. The husband has the right to manage and dispose of the joint property (with several exceptions regarding the right of disposal). Upon termination of the community property relationship, both parties or their heirs may divide the joint property. Because the scope of the joint property varies, this system can be further subdivided into the following three types: A. General Community Property System (used as the statutory system in countries such as Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, and Portugal); B. Community Property System of Movables and Income (used as the statutory system in countries such as France and Belgium); C. Community Property System of Income (used as the statutory system in countries such as Soviet Russia, Spain, several South American countries, and several states in the United States). (III) Joint Property System: The wife's property, except for what is reserved, is concentrated in the husband's possession, and there is no joint property between the spouses. Instead, each spouse preserves their original property, but all is managed by the husband. The husband has the right to usufruct and, within a specific scope, the right to dispose of the property brought in by the wife. This is its distinguishing feature (used as the statutory system in countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Japan, and several states in the United States). (IV) Dowry System: Part of the wife's property is specifically designated as a dowry to provide for household expenses and is managed by the husband. This dowry is completely separate from the wife's remaining property, but the ownership still belongs to the wife (with exceptions). The husband may not transfer or mortgage all or part of the dowry (according to the survey, no country uses this as the statutory system). (V) Separate Property System: Spouses individually enjoy the rights of ownership, management, and usufruct over their own property, and household expenses are, in principle, borne equally by the spouses (used as the statutory system in countries such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Italy, Greece, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and several states in the United States). The above-mentioned property systems for spouses are only described in broad terms. In reality, when adopting a certain system, countries often incorporate elements from other systems. For example, the joint property system stipulated in the Swiss Civil Code actually includes a community property system of income, adopting its key points as follows: 1. All property owned by both parties at the time of marriage and during the continuation of the marriage constitutes marital property, with the exception of what the wife has reserved. 2. Regarding marital property, the property belonging to the wife at the time of marriage and the property inherited or gifted to the wife during the continuation of the marriage constitutes the wife's brought-in property, and she retains ownership of it. The husband is the owner of the part of the brought-in property and marital property that does not belong to the wife. 3. The wife's earnings and the natural fruits of her brought-in property belong to the husband upon separation, with the exception of what pertains to the wife's reserved property. 4. The marital property is managed by the husband, and the management expenses are borne by the husband. The wife has the right to manage within the scope that she can represent both parties. 5. The husband has the right to usufruct the wife's brought-in property and bears the responsibilities of a usufructuary. 6. Except for management, the husband may not dispose of the wife's brought-in property without the wife's consent, except for what already belongs to the husband. 7. The wife may dispose of the marital property within the scope that she can represent both parties. Considering the above seven points, the Swiss joint property system is both convenient for maintaining a shared life and sufficient to protect the rights of both parties, striking a balance that is also suitable for our country's situation. Therefore, it is proposed to adopt it as the usual statutory system. In specific circumstances, such as one party's bankruptcy, the separate property system is naturally adopted (see Article 182 of the Swiss Civil Code). Furthermore, when one of the spouses is subject to compulsory execution of debts and cannot pay them off, the court may, at the request of the other spouse, declare the adoption of the separate property system (see Article 183 of the same law). Therefore, adopting the separate property system as the extraordinary statutory system also follows the precedents of Switzerland and other countries. It is proposed to limit the contractual systems to the following three types: (1) Community Property System; (2) Uniform Property System; (3) Separate Property System. The reason for limiting the contractual property systems to the statutory types is to avoid situations where the freedom of contract in spousal relationships lacks standards, resulting in different systems for different people, which would make transactions with third parties difficult and create a sense of distrust in society. Regarding the property system for spouses, whether it is permissible to change to another system by contract during the continuation of the marriage after it has been agreed upon is also an important related question that should be addressed. Examining various countries, some prohibit it (e.g., Belgium, Spain, Brazil, and several South American countries, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, etc.), some allow it (e.g., Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark, etc.), and some take a compromise approach by allowing it under certain conditions (e.g., Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, the United Kingdom). It is now proposed to adopt a compromise approach, allowing both parties to enter into another contract with appropriate conditions, such as: 1. It must be permitted by the court; 2. It must not harm the rights of third parties. These conditions can provide some restrictions to avoid abuses. The number and content of the conditions should be determined when drafting the articles. Point 7: The Issue of Concubines? There is no need to stipulate anything regarding the issue of concubines. (Explanation) The system of concubinage should be abolished as soon as possible. Although it still exists in fact, the law should not recognize its existence. There is no need to specifically stipulate its status in the code or in separate laws. As for the status of their children, such as issues of inheritance and marriage restrictions, all illegitimate children are treated the same as legitimate children, and these issues have already been stipulated separately in their respective sections, so there is no need to address them separately here. Point 8: Should the Family System Be Stipulated? The family system should be stipulated in a separate chapter. (Explanation) There is still room for research on the merits and demerits of individualism versus familism today, and the Chinese family system has been the foundation of social organization for thousands of years. It may be difficult to fundamentally overturn it, or it may have too great an impact on society. In fact, it seems appropriate to preserve this type of organization. Legally, the existence of the family system should be recognized, and a separate chapter should be established to define it in detail. Point 9: The Issue of Family System Orientation (1) The provisions of the family system should be based on communal living and place more emphasis on the obligations of the family head. (2) The family head should be gender-neutral. (Explanation) The original purpose of recognizing the existence of the family system is to maintain the communal living of the entire family. Therefore, it should be based on the communal living of the family members and not on the authority of the family head. The family systems stipulated in Switzerland and the Balkan countries can serve as references. Chinese customs emphasize the rights of the family head while neglecting their obligations, and only men are qualified to be family heads while women are not, which is not in line with the current situation. Therefore, in maintaining the family system, emphasis should be placed on the obligations of the family head, and it should be clearly stipulated that the family head is gender-neutral, so that both social psychology and global trends can be taken into account.

<p>Since Wuhu decided to close the grain stabilization bureau, rice prices suddenly soared yesterday, with each dollar only buying five Sheng (originally eight Sheng). The general populace was greatly alarmed. In addition to requesting that local authorities find ways to provide relief, various groups are planning to hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Association held a meeting today and resolved to request that the Municipal Government reorganize the Design Committee established by the Municipal Government, as it exists in name only. Furthermore, because the municipal donation collected by the Municipal Government was originally intended for local construction and education, but has recently been used entirely for the Municipal Government's expenses, which is clearly inconsistent with the original plan, it was resolved to request that the Municipal Government allocate a portion of the municipal donation for education and construction to avoid waste.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government, considering the bandit group that robbed the Huangmu Ferry in Nanling County a source of great danger if not completely eliminated, has telegraphed an order to Battalion Commander Feng of the 3rd Battalion stationed in Wuhu to lead his troops to suppress them. It also ordered the counties of Wuhu, Nanling, and Xuancheng to jointly suppress them. The county magistrates of the three counties have now agreed to encircle them from different directions and dispatched police teams simultaneously yesterday afternoon. They made contact with the bandits at a location twenty Li from Nanling at 2 PM today.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation previously petitioned the Ministry of Finance based on a resolution of the Representative Assembly to abolish the egg tax at Fengyang Customs.

<p>First District Repairs Bridges and Roads: Since District Chief Zhong actively renovated the Gaotang Bridge in the urban area of this county, the main roads have been clear and unobstructed. Now, it is gradually extending to branch roads. The Fu Bridge in front of the county government is an important point for future access to the county road. At the request of local residents, construction began the day before yesterday and is expected to be completed by the end of the month. The Tà Bridge Main Street outside the west gate is being paved with stone slabs removed from the county road, making it flat and smooth. It will be completed soon. The South Street of Puzhao Temple in the city has also been in disrepair for many years, with broken bricks and stones making it difficult for pedestrians. Although the district office feels the economic hardship, it has decided to carry out repairs on the 5th for the convenience of the public.</p>

Jin Deqing, startled from his sleep, believed them and opened the door. The robbers rushed into the house, went straight to the bedroom, dragged Jin Kui (the current township chief) off the bed, and forced him to hand over silver dollars. They then stabbed Jin Kui in the chest with a sharp knife, causing him to bleed profusely and fall to the ground in pain. The robbers then ransacked the house, stealing 120 silver dollars and all the land deeds.

After leaving the hotel, Xu Yun stayed at his house for several days. He did not know that Xu Yun borrowed a gun from Li Hongze. Xu Yun, 20, from Zhouzhuang, stated that he was a second-year student at Yancheng Middle School in Suzhou and had a teacher-student relationship with Li Hongze. He borrowed the gun from him for self-defense and had no other intentions. Li Rongbao, 30, who lived in the west gate and worked for a transport company, stated that he did not know Li Hongze and Xu Yun until Xu Yongliang introduced them. Xu Yongliang was his neighbor.

<h3 id="e153">County Chamber of Commerce States Unemployment Relief Case <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>After the County Chamber of Commerce investigated the social and economic situation yesterday, it presented relief measures to the county government. In the industrial and commercial aspects, there are no large-scale industries to speak of other than the foil, wine, and silk industries. The foil industry in Shaoxing involves no less than 300,000 people, including manufacturers and vendors. Although the annual tax revenue of this product reaches 1,670,000 yuan, due to the continuous improvement of social culture and knowledge on the one hand and the weakening of the economic ability of the people on the other hand, there is a gradual concept of abolishing tin foil. Therefore, in the past one or two years, foil shops and foil shops have closed down one after another due to poor business conditions, and there are many workers who are unemployed in the foil industry. The relief methods should be divided into two types: fundamental cure and palliative cure. The fundamental cure should be to establish vocational schools to provide young people in the foil industry with relevant vocational education so that they can make a living in the future and avoid the tragedy of unemployment. The palliative cure should be to jointly establish large-scale factories by the government and local authorities to enable all the workers in the foil industry to work in factories to replace the labor force. This is a fundamental transformation for the foil industry. Shaoxing wine is a major product of Shaoxing, with an annual tax revenue of about one million yuan. However, its raw materials are mostly purchased from other provinces, which is very different from products made entirely from local raw materials. Therefore, those engaged in this industry are no different from using labor to exchange for wages. The heavy donations and taxes increase the burden, and the chaos of war and bandits obstruct transportation, all of which are enough to suppress the development of the wine industry. The relief methods should be to reduce tax rates and eliminate chaos to facilitate transportation and alleviate business difficulties. This is a fundamental maintenance for the wine industry. Yue silk is also a major product of Shaoxing. In recent years, imported clothing materials have flooded the market, causing domestic silk to be unsalable and profit rights to be lost. Fangqiao and Huahe in Shaoxing were originally known for producing silk. Now, due to the failure of the silk industry, the silk shops have closed down, the machine workers have stopped weaving, and no less than tens of thousands of workers are unemployed. And the relief methods, on the one hand, should actively promote domestic products so that the sales of domestic silk can be expanded to replace imported clothing materials.</p>

It was also heard that Fan Shou Kang, the former principal of Chunhui Middle School, and two other people had already contacted the bandits, and it is expected that they will be rescued in the near future.</p>

<p>Arriving in Shanghai around August 3rd</p>
<p>(Kobe Express News) After it was reported that a group of 42 members of the Shanghai University Children's Army, led by Ni Jiaxi, traveled to Japan, they visited famous scenic spots such as Osaka, Nara, and Kyoto, and visited urban cultural facilities. On July 15, they arrived in Yokohama and were received by Liu Zhang, the head of the local Chinese Children's Army in Japan, and executives of the Japan Boy Scout Federation. They stayed at the Chinese Association and attended a welcome tea party. On the 16th, they went to Enoshima and Kamakura to enjoy the beautiful scenery and swim in the sea. On the 17th, they had a friendly match with the Chinese basketball team. The next morning, they took a tram to Tokyo and received a warm welcome. The modern civilization of the Japanese capital after its reconstruction, the orderliness of traffic, the prosperity of department stores, the abundance of parks, and the popularity of sports all surprised and impressed the group. After staying for two days, they took a train from Ueno to Nikko to visit historical sites and famous scenic spots, and camped out in tents. Unfortunately, the continuous rain reduced their interest. Subsequently, they were invited by Count Mishima, the president of the Japan Boy Scout Federation, to stay at his villa in Shiobara Nasu for three nights. Count Mishima is the Japanese representative of the International Boy Scout Federation. This time, he provided cordial hospitality and was very amiable. After July 27, they arrived in Yokohama. That night, they held a bonfire game with the Chinese and Japanese Boy Scouts. About 300 people attended. The gathering of young people from the two countries was a truly unprecedented international event for the local Boy Scouts. On the 28th, they bid farewell on the Haruna Maru and headed to Kobe. On the 30th, when the ship docked, due to a misreport by the shipping company, the local Chinese Boy Scouts were unable to arrive. Only Mr. Zeng Yanhua, a compatriot, welcomed them alone. Later, Mr. Udaka, a member of the Kobe Japanese Boy Scout Committee, and Mr. Omori, a Kobe city secretary, arrived on the ship. Mr. Zeng introduced them and provided translation services. They were impressed by the special preferential treatment provided by the Japanese authorities, who provided free tram rides to Tenjin Beach. That night, Hyogo Prefecture and Kobe City jointly hosted the Shanghai University Children's Army at the Central Pavilion Western Restaurant. Representatives of the Japanese authorities delivered speeches to welcome them and expressed their hope that the young nationals of China and Japan would be able to contact each other frequently in the future to foster friendship and benefit the diplomatic relations between the two countries. Then, Team Leader Ni stood up to thank them and praised the progress of Japanese culture and the warm hospitality received from all parties during this trip, expressing his deep gratitude. After the banquet, the team members acted freely and returned to the ship around 10:00 PM for one night. As for tomorrow (July 31), they will visit the Kawasaki Shipyard at 8:00 AM. It is said that this procedure was arranged by the authorities and the Ministry of the Navy with special approval, which shows the thoughtfulness of the Japanese side's hospitality. At 11:00 AM, they will have a friendly match with the overseas Chinese Tongwen Junior High School basketball team (results will be reported later). They are scheduled to depart from Kobe at 3:00 PM to return to Shanghai. According to a report on July 11, the team has been traveling around for two weeks. The team members are all energetic and healthy. This trip is the happiest one they have had. (Sent on July 30)</p>

Those in the Yangtze River area, as well as Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces, took a boat to Shanghai or Nanjing and then took a train directly to the meeting. Fearing that the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways would be inconvenient at that time, the association decided to prepare for both sea and land routes for the safety of the members' travel to the meeting. In case they had to travel by sea, the Dalian Steamship Company has agreed to offer group fares at 20% off for round trips. However, the association's original plan to change the route will change. Those in the northern provinces should take a boat from Tianjin or Dalian. Those in the Yangtze River area, as well as Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces, must gather in Shanghai and take a boat. It is said that the association has notified members in the south to take the Sakaki Maru from Shanghai on the 21st.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders Schools Not to Elect "Queens"</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to all levels of schools in the city, stating: "The Shanghai First District Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) has sent an official letter stating that the title of 'Queen' is a form of honorific title from the imperial era. Now that the form of government has changed, how can such feudalistic titles be allowed to continue? The election of 'Queens' has become fashionable in various schools, with each school imitating the other, which is no different from preserving the influence of general feudal ideas. We request that you be consulted to ban this practice and instruct all newspapers to avoid using the term 'Queen' when publishing photos of female students." The bureau believes that the points raised in the letter are well-founded and should be verified and handled. The bureau believes that the title of "Queen" belongs to the imperial era, and now that the form of government has long been changed, it is no longer appropriate to use this title, which contains feudal ideas. Hereafter, schools must not hold any more "Queen" elections, and the title "Queen" must not be used. In addition to instructing all newspapers to avoid using the term "Queen" when publishing photos of female students, all levels of schools are hereby ordered to comply with this order.</p>

<p>China Women's Physical Education School Holds Alumni Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Women's Physical Education School on Qingyun Road, Zhabei, held its annual alumni meeting yesterday. Graduates from previous classes attended. Ji Guozhen was elected as chairman, and Zhou Jicheng as secretary. Principal Hua reported on the school's situation and the development of school affairs over the years.

Ms. Zhou Jicheng, who works at Jiujiang No. 3 Women's Middle School, has organized a similar alumni association, which allows news to circulate quickly and benefits both the school and the individuals. She hopes that alumni working elsewhere who have not yet organized alumni associations will do so starting next semester to benefit from collective efforts.

<p>Japanese Soccer Team Embarks on Overseas Expedition</p>
<p>The team will depart on the 17th of this month and return on October 14th, aiming for a decisive battle against the Chinese team four years later. Japanese soccer has traditionally been underdeveloped, consistently ranking last in the Far East Games, which has been a source of shame for the Japanese sports community. To rectify this, Japan has spared no effort in soccer training over the past three years, employing various scientific research methods to improve their skills. Players have also been given financial support. As a result, the progress of Japanese soccer has been remarkable. At the 8th Shanghai Games, they surprisingly won second place, a groundbreaking achievement. Not content with this, Japan has been diligently promoting soccer at home for the past two years, resulting in a significant increase in strength. At the recent Tokyo Games, they tied with China for first place, with the championship being held over until the next Games. Japan considers this four-year period an excellent opportunity to train their players' skills. Therefore, they have initiated an expedition to the United States to learn from others' strengths and compensate for their own weaknesses, with the aim of competing against the Chinese team in a decisive battle at the 10th Far East Games four years later and capturing the championship. What is most astonishing is that the players are not constrained by economic concerns and are all full-time professionals without occupational distractions. It is doubtful that our country can compare to this situation. Japan, aware that the Chinese team has already begun its expedition to Europe, has decided that its team will depart for the Americas and Canada on August 17th. All preparations for the expedition have been completed. Prior to departure, they will conduct two weeks of intensive training at the foot of Mount Fuji, with two intense matches every morning and evening. The leader and coach of the expedition are Mr. Kameyama and Mr. Hobimi. The itinerary is as follows:</p>
<p>August 1st to 14th: Training camp</p>
<p>August 17th: Depart from Yokohama in the afternoon</p>
<p>August 29th: Arrive in Vancouver, Canada</p>
<p>September 1st: First match against Vancouver team</p>
<p>September 6th: Second match against Vancouver team</p>
<p>September 13th: First match against Victoria</p>
<p>September 17th: Second match against Victoria</p>
<p>September 24th: Match against Columbia team</p>
<p>September 27th: Match against Columbia University</p>
<p>September 28th: Visit Seattle</p>
<p>September 29th: Return to Vancouver</p>
<p>October 14th: Return to Yokohama</p>
<p>Results of Yesterday's Open Doubles Tennis Tournament</p>
<p>The second round of the Open Doubles Tennis Championship was held yesterday, with only two matches played after 5 PM at the China Tennis Club. The crowd was very enthusiastic, but both matches were one-sided due to the disparity in strength. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia defeated Guo Qida and Yuan Shilong 6-3, 6-0.</p>
<p>Kana Fan and Lotta Foss defeated Wang Nishi and Sun Chenbi 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Shanghai International Tennis Tournament to Be Held on August 13th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tennis Tournament originally had the International Robert Cup as the focus of international competition each year, but only one doubles match could not generate enough interest. This season, the Chinese Tennis Association initiated the Shanghai International Tennis Championship, with Rotary President Fuliqi donating a valuable trophy to be held annually, similar to the Davis Cup. The competition method is also based on the Davis Cup system, with four singles groups and one doubles group, which is a groundbreaking innovation in the tennis world. It is expected that the United States, Britain, Portugal, Japan, France, and Germany will join. The Chinese Tennis Association held a committee meeting yesterday and decided that the competition will be held on August 13th. The results of the meeting are summarized below:</p>
<p>The Chinese Tennis Association Committee held a meeting at the Western Restaurant of the YMCA on Sichuan Road yesterday afternoon. Committee members Hu Xiansheng, Hu Yunlai, Ma Dehao, Zhang Zizhen, Lin Baohua, Secretary Zhou Jiaqi, and Association Director Hao Boyang attended. During the meeting, they discussed the Shanghai International Tennis Tournament and other important matters within the association, and studied and resolved the issues one by one. The resolutions are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Officially accepted the Shanghai International Tennis Tournament prize donated by the Rotary Club and sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<p>(2) Scheduled the Shanghai International Tennis Tournament to begin on August 13th and immediately sent letters inviting sports organizations from various countries in Shanghai to join the competition and prepare for registration.</p>
<p>(3) Changed the Open Doubles Tennis Tournament to the semi-finals on August 9th and the finals on the 10th. Tickets will be sold at six dimes per game.</p>
<p>An Amateur Tennis Tournament in the City</p>
<p>The amateur tennis competition at the City Public Sports Field held three matches yesterday. The results and the schedule for this afternoon and tomorrow morning are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Group, Players, Result, Score, Umpire</p>
<p>Fang, Gong Zhenyi defeated Li Limin, 6-2, 6-0, Sun Chuanxin</p>
<p>Xia, Chen Yifu defeated Lu Weiwei, 6-1, 6-1, Guo Qida</p>
<p>Xiao, Xu Qiaosheng defeated Wang Keyong, 6-2, 6-1, Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>Li Limin's Corner</p>
<p>Li Limin has all the skills and techniques of tennis, but he is very peaceful and unwilling to exert his full strength in competition, as if nothing in the world is worth fighting for. He maintained this attitude in yesterday's match against Gong Zhenyi, losing 6-2, 6-0.</p>
<p>Colleagues Declare War</p>
<p>Chen Yifu works at Wenming Bookstore, and Lu Weiwei works at Zhonghua Bookstore. Their duel on the court can be described as colleagues declaring war. Although Lu's skills are not as steady, he occasionally produces surprisingly good shots, retrieving extremely difficult balls. Chen, on the other hand, is more experienced and methodical. In the end, Chen won with two 6-1 sets. Lu's foot pain inevitably took its toll.</p>
<p>Wang Keyong, an official of the Municipal Education Bureau, has made rapid progress in tennis practice during his spare time. He recently suffered from a foot ailment that made it difficult for him to move. He tried his best in yesterday's match against Xu Qiaosheng, who works at the post office, but his pain and running made him lose a lot. In the end, he lost 6-2, 6-1.</p>

<p>Songhu Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Notice to Maintain Public Order</p>
<p>Punishment Under Military Law for Those Who Disrupt Local Order and Traffic</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Notice on the Songhu Garrison Area: This notice concerns the fact that we are currently in a time of war, and the security of the rear areas is extremely important. Songhu is a crucial location with a mix of Chinese and foreign residents. Enemy agents often take advantage of communists and bandits to incite unrest and create disturbances, attempting to commit wrongdoing. The Headquarters, for the safety of the people of Songhu and to maintain local order, must strictly guard against and suppress any signs of unrest. Therefore, we issue this notice to inform everyone that anyone who, without authorization, gathers a crowd to disrupt local order, regardless of their identity, will be punished under military law for disturbing the rear areas. There will be no leniency. Anyone who reports such activities in advance, leading to the cracking of a case, will be rewarded generously. We urge everyone to be vigilant. Commander Xiong Shihui</p>
<p>Preventing Disruption of Traffic</p>
<p>Headquarters Notice to Both Road Bureaus: This notice concerns the fact that we are currently in a time of war, and the traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways is crucial. We fear that unscrupulous individuals may be lurking, plotting to disrupt traffic. The Headquarters, to maintain the safety of both roads and local order, has already ordered military police along the lines to conduct strict inspections. Therefore, we issue this notice to inform everyone that residents in the vicinity must not harbor bandits, disrupt traffic, or engage in any activities that may hinder the operation of the railways. Otherwise, once discovered, anyone, regardless of their identity, will be punished under military law for disturbing the rear areas. There will be no leniency. Anyone who reports such activities in advance, leading to the cracking of a case, will be rewarded generously. We urge everyone to be vigilant.</p>
<p>Postal Service Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>Satisfactory Results from Yesterday's Two Rounds of Negotiations</p>
<p>Postal Workers to Receive an Additional Two Yuan Rice Subsidy Per Month</p>
<p>The ten unresolved issues between the Shanghai Postal Workers Union and the Employees Union, which had been delayed for nearly a year, were finally resolved. On the 24th of last month, a general request was submitted to the Post Office General Administration, requesting a satisfactory response within five days. Wei Yifu, Director-General of the Post Office General Administration, repeatedly sent his secretary, Mr. Yang Sili, to negotiate with representatives of the two unions, but without success. The two sides nearly reached a breaking point. Fearing that this would lead to unrest, Director-General Wei personally came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to discuss the matter with Wang Boqun, Minister of Communications. He then prepared to resolve the postal workers' strike peacefully. Yesterday, he convened representatives of the two unions for two rounds of negotiations. As a result of mutual concessions, the impending strike was averted. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Details</p>
<p>Wei Yifu, Director-General of the Post Office, concurrently serves as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications. Recently, the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has caused him much concern. Furthermore, Minister Wang Boqun suffered a slight illness during his tenure in Shanghai last week, delaying his return to Beijing until the night before last. Director-General Wei, burdened by ministerial affairs, was unable to leave Beijing until the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he immediately intended to convene representatives of the unions to discuss ways to approach the situation. However, as that day was a Sunday, he was unable to contact the union representatives. Yesterday morning, he finally sent the notice to hold negotiations to the union representatives, inviting two representatives from each union to the Director-General's office at 9 AM yesterday morning. The representatives of the Postal Employees Union, Fu Dewei, Tang Yong, Wang Yuguang, and Zhu Hailan, and the representatives of the Postal Workers Union, Zhu Xuefan, Lu Jingshi, Zhang Kechang, and Qi Jiamou, arrived at the Director-General's office at 10 AM to begin formal negotiations. After three hours, most of the ten conditions had been agreed upon, and it was agreed to continue negotiations at 4 PM. At 4:30 PM, the two sides resumed negotiations at the same location. Finally, through mutual concessions, the remaining issues were resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Resolved Conditions</p>
<p>The conditions resolved through negotiations between the two sides yesterday are as follows: (A) Regarding (1) the timely publication of the postal service's economic final accounts and budgets in each district; (2) the issue of the Director-General's secretary not being entitled to the same treatment as postal personnel, and the correction of Bureau Order No. 208; (3) the issue of preferential examinations for letter carriers and messengers who have served for more than 15 years to be promoted to postal assistants; (4) the establishment of a new grade of messenger within the bureau to accommodate letter carriers who are injured in the line of duty or elderly; (5) the restoration of the national personnel transfer semi-monthly publication: all five items will be implemented in accordance with the union's requested opinions. (B) All postal personnel nationwide will receive a subsidy of two yuan per month due to the low value of silver. (C) Year-end bonuses: those who have served for more than one year but less than ten years will receive one-fourth of a month's salary; those who have served for more than ten years will receive one and a half months' salary. (D) Improve the treatment of child messengers: (1) The title of "child messenger" will be changed; (2) the starting salary will be changed to 15 yuan, and the highest salary will be changed to 21 yuan; (3) those who cannot pass the examination to become postal assistants after three years will be reassigned as messengers; (4) other benefits, such as holidays, annual bonuses, and death benefits, will be the same. (E) The issue of revising the salaries of all grades below postal assistant will be resolved by representatives of the union in consultation with the authorities within two months and implemented from July 1st. (F) The issue of improving holidays will be improved by representatives of the two unions in consultation with the authorities within one month. After the Director-General made these decisions, the representatives of the two unions were satisfied and convened a general meeting of the members of each department and team that night to report on the progress. At that time, it was decided to hold a dinner party on Sunday of this week for those who participated in this work. Regarding the issue of opposing Liu Shufan and merging the remittance and savings bureau with the post office, it is reported that the union will send representatives to Beijing to petition separately.</p>
<p>Port Authority Rushes to Repair the East Embankment Seawall</p>
<p>Since the sudden hurricane on July 14th and 15th, the sea surface has been surging with tides. All the original seawall surfaces at Dongtang, the 20 zhang and 34 zhang sections at the north end of the "Ai" character series, the 45 zhang section at the east end of the Shenjiazhai "Shou" character series, the 6 zhang 5 chi and 10 zhang sections at the end of the work, the 15 zhang section at the north end of the Daijiazhai "Shuai" character series, and the 38 zhang section of the "Yizhou" character series of the Yizhou Embankment have been washed away, with soil losses of three, four, or five chi. The situation is extremely critical. Fortunately, the Port Authority Seawall Office immediately discovered the situation and reported it to the Port Authority, requesting funds to purchase materials and transport them to the construction site. The most important parts were urgently blocked. On the 27th, 28th, and 29th, another hurricane struck, howling wildly at night, accompanied by torrential rain. The storm surge in Dongtang directly impacted the seawall, with the tide level only three chi away from the top of the seawall. The situation was extremely dangerous and unprecedented in recent years. Among them, the "Jiang" character series, which is located at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the ocean's storm surge, and the "Shuai" character series, which has a more protruding seawall and the narrowest bund and is the most vulnerable to the sea tide, had sections that were repaired last year. For example, the three sections at the north end of the Biao family's residence in the "Jiang" character series, totaling 67 zhang in length, and one section at the east end of the Dai family's residence in the "Shuai" character series, totaling 5 zhang in length, all the built-up earthen seawalls were washed away, the stone slopes were cracked, and the situation was on the verge of collapse. The soil-filled sacks were also scattered and disappeared. In addition to the above-mentioned 5 zhang, another 11 zhang were destroyed in the "Shuai" character series section, totaling 16 zhang. In the "Rong" character series section, only 10 zhang were washed away, with the seawall surface being 8-9 chi to over a zhang. The Port Authority is requesting funds to purchase materials and urgently carry out repairs.</p>
<p>Jiangzhen Sailed into the Yangtze River Yesterday</p>
<p>The Jiangzhen warship, which was repaired by the Ministry of the Navy, was ordered by the Ministry of the Navy to be transferred to the Yangtze River. The ship left Gaochangmiao Port at 10 AM yesterday and is expected to pass Xiaguan this morning. According to sources in the local naval community, the Navy's defenses on the Yangtze River are very thorough. The current fleet stationed in Jiujiang includes the Minquan, Jiankang, and Weisheng gunboats.</p>
<p>Foreign Warships from Three Countries Arrive in China, Japanese Fleet Dispatched</p>
<p>The Electric Communication Agency reported on the 4th that the 24th Destroyer Squadron, belonging to the Sasebo Naval Port, has been dispatched and is currently busy loading military supplies. It is scheduled to depart from Sasebo at noon on the 5th to Shanghai. The follow-up telegram stated that the 24th Destroyer Squadron has been dispatched to guard the Yangtze River coast. The squadron is currently conducting an emergency recall of personnel on leave, and all ships are busy loading military supplies. The commander of the "Kashi" ship, Lieutenant Commander Ishikawa, said that the dispatch has been decided, and Commander Yanagihara is also scheduled to return to his post tomorrow, so it is expected to depart at noon.</p>
<p>Five British Ships Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, five British warships suddenly sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai and are now stationed in Wusong and the Huangpu River. Two of them are destroyers and three are gunboats. It is said that they were ordered to come to China to protect British nationals.</p>
<p>US Flagship to Hankou</p>
<p>The commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet stationed in Shanghai sailed to Jiujiang and Hankou on the flagship yesterday. The mission is to inspect the current situation of US warships stationed in various ports along the Yangtze River and the security situation of American nationals in Hunan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Prepares to Hold Second Economic Conference</p>
<p>Scheduled for Mid-October</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance held a National Economic Conference in Shanghai last year. All procedures were handled by the Ministry's staff in conjunction with the Shanghai Office, and the results were very good. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen believes that the domestic economic situation has changed greatly recently and needs to be studied in a meeting. Therefore, he has instructed the staff of various departments to prepare for the Second National Economic Conference. All procedures and ceremonies will be the same as the first, but the location of the meeting, whether in Shanghai or Beijing, has not yet been determined. The Ministry and the Shanghai Office of the Minister are preparing for the meeting, which is scheduled to be held in mid-October.</p>
<p>Dazhong Steamer Sinks After Hitting Reef</p>
<p>Crew and Sailors All Rescued</p>
<p>Losses Exceed 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Dazhong steamer, owned by the Shanghai Heng'an Shipping Company, specializes in routes to various ports in the South China Sea, carrying only passengers and cargo, not passengers. Last month, it carried a large shipment of Rangoon rice to eastern Zhejiang. In late last month, it loaded a large shipment of goods in Shanghai and sailed to Fujian. When the ship reached the waters off Fuzhou, it encountered a strong wind. The ship was hit by waves and struck a reef in the waters off Fuzhou. The bottom of the ship was first pierced by a submerged reef, and seawater rushed into the cargo hold. The water level in each hold rose further, and the ship began to sink into the sea. After the accident, the shipowner urgently sent a distress signal. A strong storm arose on the sea, and the Dazhong steamer was driven by the storm waves into a cluster of reefs, causing the hull to be breached in more than one place. Seeing no hope of rescue, the crew and sailors took life jackets, sampans, and other life-saving equipment to escape. It was later learned that a passing ship sent a telegram to Fuzhou to report the incident and assist in the rescue, allowing all crew members on the Dazhong steamer, from the shipowner to the sailors, to be rescued without injury. However, the Dazhong steamer was completely destroyed. All the cargo and the crew's luggage were lost at sea. The total loss is estimated to be at least 200,000 yuan. The ship, with a displacement of over 2,000 tons, had peace insurance in Shanghai. After the accident, Heng'an Company notified the passengers and insurance companies to send personnel to the site of the accident for inspection.</p>
<p>Chongsha Shipping Industry Competition Mediation Breaks Down</p>
<p>Last year, the six shipping companies on the Shanghai-Taiwan route suffered significant losses due to excessive competition. After mediation by the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Shipping Association, the six companies formed a joint company alliance. Business has improved significantly in the past six months. Unexpectedly, one wave has just subsided, and another has risen. Six shipping companies on the Chongsha line suddenly started competing for business. To protect the interests of fellow businesses, the Shanghai Shipping Association intervened to mediate. Unexpectedly, yesterday's mediation meeting broke down. This matter is of great importance to the coastal shipping industry. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>Truth About the Competition</p>
<p>There are six companies operating ships on the Shanghai-Haimen Chongsha route, including Ping'an, Jufeng, Daxing, Dada, Baofeng, and Xinxinglong. One month ago, Ping'an Company first lowered prices to compete, reducing the original fare of six dimes per person from Shanghai to Chongsha to 300 wen, a decrease of nearly seven or eight tenths. The other five shipping companies had no choice but to reduce prices as well. Ping'an then suspended the Baohua ship for major repairs. The five companies have suffered significant losses in the past month or so.</p>
<p>Reasons for Mediation</p>
<p>Recently, Ping'an Company's old Baohua ship has been repaired and will soon resume service. The company's manager, Chen Shutang, sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Association, requesting that the committee members of the association intervene and mediate with the other five companies, such as Dada, to restore the original price. The Shanghai Shipping Association received the letter and believed that the matter concerned fellow businesses and should intervene to mediate. The association publicly appointed Liu Shisun, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Ganqing, and others as arbitration committee members, advising the six companies to abandon the mutually destructive competition and quickly cooperate, following the precedent of the Shanghai-Taiwan line. Yesterday, the representatives of the six companies were invited to the meeting to discuss the solution.</p>
<p>Breakdown of the Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Chen Shutang of Ping'an, Xu Zhongxin of Daxing, and Shen Qinqin of Jufeng arrived at the Shipping Association. The mediation committee members, Liu, Yuan, and Chen, explained that there should be a spirit of cooperation on the same route and that business has improved since the six companies on the Shanghai-Taiwan route formed a joint venture, which is clear evidence. They then discussed the mediation plan, which was also based on the precedent of the Shanghai-Taiwan line, estimating the total annual revenue of the Chongsha route at 600,000 yuan and allocating it among the six companies according to the size of their ships. The ship with the most seats would be allocated 115,000 yuan per year, and the ship with the fewest seats would be allocated 95,000 yuan. After the agreement was reached, Chen Shutang of Ping'an suddenly requested that the Baohua ship be counted as a first-class ship, which was opposed by the five companies because the Baohua ship had fewer seats than the other five ships. The two sides refused to back down, resulting in the invalidation of the resolution. The mediation committee members were also angered and disregarded the situation, leading to the dissolution of the meeting. The Chongsha shipping companies are still disrupting each other in competition.</p>
<p>Pujiang Commercial Steamer Causes Accident, Ikoma Maru Damaged</p>
<p>The Ikoma Maru, a Japanese-Chinese class steamer of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, was unloading cargo at the post office dock in Shanghai after arriving from Kobe. When a certain French steamer was leaving the port and turning east outside the Waibaidu Bridge, the current was swift, and the ship was pushed by the tide. It was unable to stop and collided with the bow and outer side of the Ikoma Maru steamer. The hull of the Ikoma Maru was breached immediately. Fortunately, the damage was above the waterline and did not affect the cargo in the cabin. After learning of the incident, the Japanese Mail Steamship Company sent personnel to verify the damage. Repairs began yesterday.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education is administering a pre-college entrance exam for graduates of unregistered private senior high schools.

<h3 id="e166">Strict Ban on Bathing in the Huangpu River <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>As summer arrives and the weather is hot, groups of children are often seen learning to swim in the Huangpu River on both the east and west banks. However, those unfamiliar with swimming often lose their footing and drown, which has been frequently reported. Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has issued a public notice at various docks in view of this situation:</p>
<p>"It has been learned from the report of Wang Luozhang, the patrol officer of the Huatong Warehouse, on the 2nd of this month that a boy's body was found floating in the Huangpu River at 9:00 a.m. Upon investigation, it was found to be the son of Yang Xisheng, named Shunfa, aged twelve, who drowned while bathing at the Garden Stone Bridge. In light of this, it is noted that water and fire are inherently merciless. The tides of the river are even more dangerous. How can children know the risk of losing their lives? Those who speak only sigh, and those who hear are filled with pity. Hereafter, those who bathe in the river along the banks will be considered to be acting carelessly. Adult men will be taken to the district for punishment, and the parents or elder brothers of young children will be held responsible. The police officers at each post are responsible for maintaining the health of the people and should earnestly investigate and prohibit such activities. Do not treat this as a mere formality. All must strictly abide by this notice without fail."</p>
<h3 id="e167">Trial Opens in Case of Russian Shooting Portuguese Man <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Russian Denies Shooting</p>
<p>Witnesses to Be Summoned for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Mr. Lao Lai Luo, a Portuguese man currently employed at the Jianghai Customs, residing at No. 191 Haig Road in the French Concession, was returning to his residence by car at 9:30 p.m. on the 1st of this month after finishing his work. He was accompanied by an English woman, Miss Lao Ying. As they drove near the Hongqiao Road airfield in western Shanghai, a car in front of them stopped on the side of the road. A Russian man inside the car raised his hand and asked Mr. Lao's car to stop temporarily, and he asked to borrow a tire pump. Mr. Lao replied that he did not have such an item. Unexpectedly, the Russian man became angry and suddenly took out a pistol from his side and shot at Mr. Lao. A loud bang was heard, and the bullet entered the front of his chest, piercing his clothes. Fortunately, he was not injured, which was due to the rustiness of the pistol and its weak projectile force. Otherwise, it would have certainly resulted in bloodshed. After the Russian man fired the shot, he drove away quickly. Mr. Lao also returned home by car and reported the incident to the French police that night. The next day, Chinese and Western newspapers reported on the incident. The head of the Jing'an Temple police station, upon reading the reports, determined that the shooting location was within the jurisdiction of the police station and specially dispatched Western Detective Mike Wylen to the French police station to investigate the matter the day before. He then learned that the Russian man who fired the shot was Chai Wanlin, residing at No. 532 Xiafei Road. He went to arrest Chai and searched his residence, finding 107 bullets. He also brought Chai's driver, a Russian named Yishanke, to the French police station for questioning about the whereabouts of the pistol. Chai claimed that he had discarded the gun after firing it. The Western detective then took Mr. Chai to the place where he had discarded the weapon and subsequently found the original pistol. Yesterday morning, Chai and others were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Wu presided over the trial. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case and stated that the plaintiff, the Portuguese man, and the English woman who was in the car had not yet arrived in court. He requested that the relevant consuls be notified to order their presence at the next hearing. Western Detective Mike then reported the details of the arrest of the defendant. The defendant, Chai Wanlin, stated that he came to Shanghai in 1918 but often traveled between Harbin and Vladivostok. The firearm was deposited by a friend who had gone to Hong Kong. He did not know the plaintiff. He claimed that he was drunk on the day in question and that the plaintiff's car was behind his car and that the bright lights had blinded him, causing him to become angry. He then argued with the plaintiff's driver and took out his gun to threaten him, but he did not fire it. When asked in court why he was carrying a weapon, he claimed that because the Hongqiao area was remote, he had encountered thieves there two years ago and carried a weapon for self-defense. Chai's driver, Yishanke, stated that he was repairing the car tire at the time and did not notice whether the master had fired the gun, but he did hear a gunshot. The court ordered the two Russians to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for August 13 to summon all the witnesses for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Trial of Kidnapping Cousin Case <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yang Zhaoxian, from Jiangbei, who did not engage in honest work, colluded with Chen Huanwen, Jiang Wenxuan, and his concubine Yang Wangshi to kidnap the four-year-old son of his aunt Wu Zhang, who lived in Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road, and hid him in a shed at No. 12 Zhoujia Bridge. The kidnapping occurred on the 27th day of the lunar calendar, and the child was found by detectives on the 28th. Because the shed was originally an empty house, but three mats were found during the search, proving that the accomplices had slept there, Yang Zhaoxian, Chen Huanwen, Jiang Wenxuan, and Yang Wangshi were transferred to the District Court, where the prosecutor investigated and filed a public prosecution for kidnapping. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Chengjun opened the trial. According to Yang Zhaoxian's confession, the child was his cousin, and he had taken him to play, colluding with Chen Huanwen and others to take him. Jiang Wenxuan was responsible for finding the house. Chen Huanwen also confessed that he was brought along by Yang Zhaoxian, and Yang Wangshi was responsible for guarding the child later. Jiang Wenxuan also confessed that he was a rickshaw puller and had rented the house after being led there. Yang Wangshi confessed that after her husband died, she became the concubine of Yang Guangxian. This time, she was guarding the child on Yang Zhaoxian's instructions, but she was very afraid of him and dared not disobey him. The judge noted that the four plaintiffs in the case had not arrived, so the debate was not opened, and the defendants were all remanded in custody for further summons.</p>

<p>Wang Chengfa, a 23-year-old Suzhou native who worked as a typesetter for the local "Continental Daily," was walking in Taiyuan Lane, French Concession, at 10:40 p.m. last night when he was suddenly attacked by three or four enemies. Without asking any questions, they pulled out sharp knives and slashed at him, inflicting one knife wound on his left leg, five knife wounds on his back, and one knife wound on his neck. Blood flowed like a river. By the time the police from Post No. 445 arrived, the murderers had fled without a trace. The police transported him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e170">He Si Abducts a Married Woman <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Su Jishi, a 31-year-old woman from Hai'an, and her husband, Mr. Su, were farmers in their hometown. Because Mr. Su felt that farming was laborious and the production was limited, he came to Shanghai to pull a rickshaw. After arriving in Shanghai, he made a good income every day, so he stayed in Shanghai and did not think about returning home. His wife, Ms. Ji, waited at home for too long and became anxious. She accompanied her brother, Ji Airong, to Shanghai and stayed at the home of Chen Baosheng, a fellow villager. She then paid attention to finding her husband's whereabouts. A man named He Si, aged 31, who lived at No. 52 Huining Road in the South City, was a rickshaw puller and was acquainted with Chen Baosheng. He often went to Chen's house at No. 43 South Railway Station Branch Road to play. He saw that Su Jishi was attractive and secretly tried to seduce her. Before long, they fell in love and had an affair. On the first of this month, they eloped together. When Ms. Ji and her brother saw that Ms. Ji's husband had disappeared, they searched everywhere without any news. Until yesterday morning at about 8:00 a.m., they happened to meet Ms. Ji near Nanjing Road and saw that He Si was also accompanying her. They immediately stepped forward and grabbed the man and woman and turned them over to the shift patrol police Ma Yuqin of the First District, First Precinct. The precinct chief interrogated them and, considering that the matter involved the abduction of a married woman, ordered that a written report be prepared and sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Two Divorce Cases <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Ye Meixian, a young woman from Ningbo, 24 years old, married Chen Zhikui, a fellow villager, at the age of 22. Now, due to differences in opinion, she has hired lawyers Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun to file a lawsuit for divorce with the District Court. The petition states that in the spring of 1930, Chen Ren, a matchmaker, arranged a marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant, Chen Zhikui, with the consent of both parents. The wedding was held on April 22 of that year at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. However, the defendant was fond of gambling and pawned the plaintiff's clothes. The plaintiff repeatedly advised him to stop, but to no avail. On January 17 of this year, the defendant's father severed his relationship with the defendant, and the plaintiff was repeatedly abused and could not live together. She turned to the Women's Association for relief. After mediation by her old neighbor Wang Wenkui and Ms. Zhu Xingyin of the Women's Association, the defendant voluntarily repented and wrote a letter of repentance, promising to return to good behavior. However, the defendant's bad habits were difficult to eradicate, and the plaintiff was still abused. The plaintiff's three-year-old son was taken away and hidden by the defendant. Such a situation is truly a break in affection and unbearable to live with. According to the precedents of the former Supreme Court (5th Year, Shang Zi No. 1073, 7th Year, Shang Zi No. 150), it constitutes grounds for divorce. Therefore, the plaintiff requests that the divorce be granted. Furthermore, the son of the plaintiff and defendant is only three years old and should not be separated from his mother. The plaintiff requests that the defendant be ordered to hand over the custody of the child to the plaintiff and that the alimony to be paid should be reserved for a separate lawsuit.</p>
<p>The defendant, Chen Zhikui, also hired lawyers Huang Han and Gu Jirong to defend and file a counterclaim requesting cohabitation. He stated that since the defendant and plaintiff married, their relationship has been good, and they have a three-year-old boy. The defendant previously worked in a foreign firm and resigned due to a minor incident. The plaintiff accused him of gambling, which is all fabricated and slanderous. The defendant's father runs a shop, and the defendant previously had private savings deposited in his father's shop. Later, because the plaintiff and her parents-in-law did not get along, the defendant had to separate from his parents and withdraw the money from the shop, which angered his father. He has now reconciled with his parents. After the defendant separated from his parents, he set up a small family. There were disputes with the plaintiff over trivial household matters, but there was no abuse or insult. Spouses have an obligation to cohabit, which was established by the former Supreme Court's precedents. Therefore, the plaintiff requests that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected and that cohabitation be ordered. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei specially opened the Second Tribunal to hear the case. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. According to the plaintiff Ye Meixian's testimony, she recounted the previous events and requested that the divorce be granted. The defendant, Chen Zhikui, stated that he was 25 years old, lived at No. 7 Kongjia Lane in Ximennei, and was currently engaged in exchange business. He and his wife had always been harmonious and did not want a divorce. He requested cohabitation. The judge then invited Prosecutor Lei Renlong to express his opinion and had the lawyers hired by both parties to debate with each other. The judge considered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the judgment for August 8.</p>
<p>Liu Chengrui, a young woman from Suqian, Jiangsu, currently residing at No. 35, Lane 4, Southwest Lane, Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Road, has hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file a lawsuit with the District Court, alleging that her husband, Sun Changyun, is addicted to bad habits, disregards her support, and arbitrarily insults and abuses her. She requests a divorce and that a public notice be served. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang opened the trial. The defendant did not appear because his address was unknown and he could not be served. A special agent, lawyer Zhou Yu, appeared to defend him. The plaintiff, Liu Chengrui, stated that she was 25 years old and that her husband, Sun Changyun, was 29 years old, also from Suqian. She married him when she was 19 years old and has not lived with him for two years. Her husband worked for a living and earned more than ten yuan a month. The judge asked, "Do you have evidence that the defendant abused you?" She replied, "No, but it is true that he beat me. Last year, I was beaten all over." The judge asked, "Since he beat you, you should have reported it to the police." She replied, "I did not report it." Prosecutor Zhao then rose to express his opinion, stating that the plaintiff claimed that she was beaten and injured by the defendant, but the plaintiff did not go to the prosecutor's office for examination, so there is no way to prove it. He should investigate the matter further and render a judgment in accordance with the law. The plaintiff's lawyer and the special agent lawyer then debated with each other. The judge ordered that witnesses be summoned for further hearing and verification.</p>

The body was then transported to the morgue. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor appointed by the Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After examining the body, he questioned the deceased's husband, Xiang Sanmei. Xiang stated that he worked as a tea boy in the Huizhong Hotel and earned very little money. He requested that the factory provide compensation. Shi Xiaozhong stated that there was no such rule in the factory unless the employees contributed one or two yuan for funeral expenses. Xu then ordered that the deceased, Xiang Tao, had died of illness. The deceased's family was struggling and could not afford a coffin. The Dahua Cloth Factory should provide twenty yuan for burial expenses, and the body should be handed over to the deceased's husband for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e175">A Cursing Incident Leads to a Fatality <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>For the Sake of "Three Pockmarks"</p>
<p>A Life Was Lost</p>
<p>Jin Yuzeng, a native of Haimen, lived in the Riyue Bridge area and had a son named Kouxiang, who was six years old. Last Saturday, a fellow villager named Wang Laosan, who had many pockmarks on his face, was cutting vegetables in the field. Kouxiang, who was naturally naughty, kicked the vegetables over, and Wang scolded him. The child cursed Wang, calling him "Three Pockmarks." Wang Laosan did not mind because he was, in fact, pockmarked. Unexpectedly, Wang's nephew, Zhou Dalang, suddenly became furious and said, "Is the name 'Three Pockmarks' something a snot-nosed kid like you can call?" He wanted to hit the child, but Jin's wife, Wu, seeing that her son was about to be beaten, stopped him and scolded the adult for hitting a child, which was inappropriate. Zhou Dalang became even angrier and clashed with her. Jin also came out to help his wife. Zhou then gathered Mao Xuewen, Shen Baoqing, and others and went to beat Jin severely. Jin was outnumbered and fled outside, thinking of asking his cousin in the North City to come and mediate like Lu Zhonglian. Therefore, he did not return on Saturday, and his wife also fled from home, leaving only their son alone. When he returned home the next day, his son Kouxiang had fallen into the river and drowned. Although Jin found that his son had fallen into the river himself, he believed that the cause of the tragedy was that Zhou Dalang had stirred up trouble for no reason, causing his wife and him to flee and leave their son unattended. Because he could not find Zhou, he brought Mao and Shen to the Second District Police Station. Yesterday, they were brought to the District Court for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Qiu Junting's Rice Boat Robbed <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Junting, a rice boat owner, recently loaded 180 stones of white rice from Wujiang to Shanghai and entrusted it to a rice broker for sale. The day before yesterday afternoon, the boat was sailing in the South Huangpu Taka area. The weather was dark, so they anchored there for the night. Unexpectedly, at midnight, three small boats arrived, carrying more than ten bandits armed with weapons. They swarmed onto the boat and forced their way into the cabin. Qiu and the six crew members woke up in surprise and, seeing that they were bandits, resisted them. However, the bandits outnumbered them, and two crew members were severely injured by the bandits' knives and sticks. Qiu's head was also injured. The bandits drove the people on the boat to the bow and monitored them. One of the crew members took advantage of the bandits' inattention and jumped ashore, blowing a police whistle. The villagers in the area heard the sound and came out to investigate. After being informed by the crew, they rushed to help. At that time, the bandits were opening the hold to loot the rice. Seeing the villagers gathering, they jumped onto the three small boats and fled south. Two anti-smuggling patrol boats passed by and, after being informed by Qiu, chased after them. Qiu checked and found that a small leather box had been robbed, containing seventy or eighty yuan in foreign currency for paying taxes and two letters entrusted by inlanders, containing drafts. Fortunately, the rice was not robbed. Two crew members were taken to the hospital after arriving in Minhang yesterday. Qiu was not seriously injured and was discharged from the hospital on the spot. The two crew members were seriously injured and remained in the hospital for treatment. In the afternoon, Qiu took a car to Shanghai to report to the rice broker and borrow money to return and open the boat to Shanghai to pay the taxes at the tax card. Upon learning of the incident, the rice boat owners in Shanghai were all on alert and dared not travel alone.</p>

<p>A Portion of the Tragically Deceased Female Corpse</p>
<p>Discovered Beside the Public Latrine</p>
<p>Two alarming paper packages were found by the public latrine on Shandong Road, north of Hankou Road, yesterday morning. Upon opening them, they were found to contain human flesh, cut from a dismembered female corpse, causing a stir among onlookers. The flesh had been rotting for some time, emitting a foul odor that was nauseating, and the flesh was covered in knife marks, causing the viewers to shudder. The origin of these two pieces of corpse flesh remains a mystery.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Discovery of Paper Packages <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a public latrine worker named 32nd saw two paper packages placed beside the wall while working at the Shandong Road public latrine. The packages were neatly wrapped, as if they had been forgotten by someone relieving themselves. The worker watched and waited for a long time, but no one came to retrieve them, so he began to suspect something. Two police officers from number 2304 happened to pass by, and the worker reported the matter. They could not guess what was inside the packages, so they cautiously opened them and were horrified.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Horrifying Human Flesh <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The two packages were roughly rectangular in shape and tightly wrapped. After successively removing the outer wrapping of newspaper and kraft paper, a foul odor struck the nose and became unbearable. When the paper packages were opened, what came into view was human flesh from a female corpse. One piece seemed to be the chest, with the shoulders, neck, and upper limbs removed. The other piece was slightly connected to the thigh muscles and was badly decomposed. In addition to the numerous knife marks, there was also a scorched color, as if it had been burned.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Conflicting Opinions <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The Central Police Station was informed of the matter and immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. There is no doubt that this case involves murder and the disposal of a corpse, but the origin of the corpse and the identity of the murderer remain a mystery. Nearby residents were quite excited about this matter, and there were conflicting rumors. One said that the corpse had been placed in the public latrine the night before, and that the person who placed it there was a rickshaw puller.</p>
<h3 id="e206">A Glimmer of Hope <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>It is said that the day before yesterday evening, a rickshaw puller surnamed Jia came from the North Station pulling a rickshaw southward. The passenger was carrying two paper packages and seemed quite concerned about them. When the rickshaw reached the Qinglian Pavilion near Fuzhou Road, the passenger suddenly made an excuse to get out of the rickshaw and left, never to return. The rickshaw puller then disappeared as well. If this is true, it is a glimmer of hope and is recorded here.</p>

<p>A Bodyguard of a Residence Grew Suspicious</p>
<p>A Large Number of Detectives Rushed to Investigate</p>
<p>Both Sides Opened Fire but Neither Hit</p>
<p>Two People Were Arrested and Three Escaped</p>
<p>At 4:45 p.m. yesterday, several thugs suddenly appeared near the intersection of Lafayette Road and La Du Road in the French Concession, loitering at the corner of the road with malicious intent. Fortunately, a residence was nearby, and the bodyguard noticed them and secretly reported to the police by telephone. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the scene to apprehend them. Two people were arrested on the spot, and both sides fired a shot, but neither hit. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Whispering Secretly by the Roadside <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>At around 4 p.m. yesterday, a white-licensed car number 12418 suddenly appeared near the intersection of Lafayette Road and La Du Road in the French Concession and stopped at the corner of the road. Two people were sitting in the car, wearing dark blue silk shirts. After the car stopped, one person hurried out of the car and whispered secretly with three people who were already standing on the grass there. Their expressions were unusually secretive.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Bodyguard Became Suspicious <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The group stood and whispered for a long time, looking around as if waiting for something. A few bodyguards of a residence were standing on the opposite side of the grass, watching from the entrance. Suddenly, they caught sight of several people gathering across the street, and a car was parked by the roadside. Suspicion arose.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Detectives Rushed to the Scene by Car <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The bodyguards carefully observed the clothing of the people, and at times glanced across the street. After a quarter of an hour, the bodyguards concluded that the people were not good. They immediately turned around, entered the house, and reported to the police by telephone. Upon hearing the news, the police chief ordered Western detective Yang Guosi, Chinese deputy detective chief Mao Jingen, Bao detective Qin Youyu, Zhou Bugeng, etc. from the theft case squad to rush to the scene by car.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Western Detective Waved Frequently <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>When the detectives arrived at the destination, they saw a white-licensed car number 12418 parked by the roadside. Two people wearing black Indian silk long shirts were standing beside the car. About forty yards away from the left side of the car, three people wearing linen long shirts and short clothes were also standing on the grass. Their behavior was suspicious. The detectives immediately approached the car, first checking the two people standing beside the car and the driver. Then, Western detective Yang Guosi waved to the three people on the grass.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Both Sides Fired a Shot <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>When the detectives checked the car, the three people standing on the grass remained still, their attitudes unusually calm. When the Western detective waved to them, one of them suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired a shot at the detectives, while fleeing southward. Western detective Yang also drew his gun and returned fire, but just as he fired a shot, the second bullet was suddenly jammed in the breech, so neither side was hit.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Two People Were Arrested and Interrogated <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>After the thugs opened fire, they immediately fled into the Chinese territory and could not be found. The detectives immediately took the two people standing beside the car, along with the car and the driver, into the police station for questioning. One person identified himself as Wang A'gen, from Jiangbei, and said he was the leader of the picket squad in a certain labor union's strike committee. The other person, Su Jianliang, a local, said he was a member of the picket squad. The remaining statements were evasive.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Driver's Statement Was Consistent <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>After questioning the driver, who identified himself as Chen Yinhuan, from Changzhou, and said he was a driver at the Dongxin Automobile Company, Bao Yu Lane, 299-301 Edward Road, he said that at around 3:50 p.m. today (yesterday), two people wearing black silk long shirts suddenly came to the company to hire a car, stating that they would be dropped off at Lujiawan. He (the driver) drove the number 12418 car there, but they did not go directly to Lujiawan, instead going to the intersection of Lafayette Road and La Du Road and parking there for about a quarter of an hour before being arrested by the Bao detective, etc. The police chief, according to the statement, immediately ordered the owner of the car company to bail out the two arrested men and await trial in court.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Flourishing Market in Western Shanghai <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Eighty or Ninety Percent Located in Chinese Territory</p>
<p>The Overreach of the Shanghai Municipal Council is Frightening</p>
<p>Chinese People Should Urgently Pay Attention</p>
<p>The prosperity of the entire city of Shanghai is increasing daily. Considering just the area of Western Shanghai, which we frequent daily, the emergence of new buildings is already astonishing. For example, on Connaught Road, five years ago, the entire road was mostly vacant land. Now, magnificent buildings line both sides. The section of Medhurst Road to Gordon Road is experiencing booming business, almost becoming a second New Zhapu Road. The section of Xiaoshadu Road around Jiangjia Bridge, as well as the dog racing track, also have continuous shops and markets being established. The public bus company is particularly thriving to Jessfield Road, with the entire road having many exquisite Chinese and Western high-class residences, with toilets, electricity, and running water fully equipped. In the early morning and as the sun sets, pedestrians are like weaving cloth. The original flourishing section of Robison Road was only around Yinhua Lane. Now, shops are densely packed along the entire road. Except for factories, the buildings are slightly inferior to those on Connaught Road. The section of Jessfield Road from Jing'an Temple to Wujiaochang, such as Yuanshan Lane and Xinkang Lane, and the high-end Chinese-style residences and shops currently under construction for rent, will number over a thousand. The vacant land of the Shanghai Municipal Council in Wujiaochang and the old houses on all sides have been renovated. The prosperity of Wujiaochang is like that of North Nicheng Bridge ten years ago, and the new buildings there still seek to exceed supply. The bustling scene at Daba, where the land has already been fully leased, is evident from this. Haig Road, Edinburgh Road, and Yuyuan Road, etc., are already recognized as the best locations for large residences, with towering trees, dense shade, and continuous rows of grand buildings. Great Western Road and Hongqiao Road, etc., have already become the tail end of the new residential area. The new buildings in the Xujiahui Beidang Road Nanyang University area are also quite numerous, particularly high-end and exquisite. In the near future, the progress of prosperity in Western Shanghai has truly unlimited potential. Eighty or ninety percent of the above is located in Chinese territory, while the overreach of the Shanghai Municipal Council in building roads is unrestrained. No wonder the aggressive ambitions of the Shanghai Municipal Council are also rising with the booming local economy. Therefore, I present this to bring it to the attention of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Truth Behind Hao Futian's Suicide <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Terrible Circumstances</p>
<p>Tragic Suicide Note</p>
<p>This newspaper previously reported on the young man and woman, a Mr. Hao and Ms. Fu Yu, who committed suicide together in Wusong. Friends and relatives of both parties received news on the day of their suicide and successively retrieved their bodies from the scene of the incident. Mr. Hao's friends and relatives knew that his father was over sixty years old and quick-tempered. He was currently residing with relatives of the Shen family in Sihe Lane in the French Concession. They were deeply afraid that once he heard this news, something unexpected might happen. In addition to arranging the funeral, they also sent a telegram urging his younger brother, Hao Gengsheng, to come to Shanghai quickly to comfort his elderly father. Therefore, they strictly kept the cause of Hao's death a secret in order to hide it from his father. Unexpectedly, he suspected the report in the newspaper and paid close attention to the investigation. Once he discovered the secret, he</p>
<h3 id="e217">Burst into Inconsolable Cries <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>And was overwhelmed with grief. Friends and relatives then tried to comfort him and sent someone from the Shen residence to watch over him to prevent any accidents. Mr. Hao's name was Futian, 36 years old, and he was a brilliant student from Huai'an People's Middle School, excelling in both Chinese and Western languages. Ren Jinping, Sun Daosheng, Tao Xiaofang, Gu Kenfu, and others were all his close classmates. After leaving school, he was hired by the local Minsheng Girls' School</p>

<p>And was extremely enthusiastic about school affairs. During the European War, he strongly supported Duan Qirui's advocacy of participating in the war and then enlisted as a translator for Chinese laborers, going to France with the Chinese labor corps. Before leaving, he entrusted Ren Jinping to act as his head of academics and also entrusted the three gentlemen Sun, Tao, and Gu to assist together, and further used the</p>

<p>The salary he received under those conditions, allocating one-tenth of it to be sent monthly to Hong Kong to support Minsheng Girls' School. Mr. Hao made real and powerful contributions to Minsheng's ability to achieve its current success. While in France, he befriended Mr. Xia Qifeng, former secretary of the League of Nations. At that time, Mr. Xia led the majority of translators in fighting for the right of hundreds of thousands of Chinese laborers to participate in the war, and Mr. Hao also greatly supported this. When he returned to China, because of his</p>
<h3 id="e220">Outstanding Service <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>He received the Iron Cross Medal. After this, he switched to the business world and served as an auditor for the Standard Oil Company in Northeast China. The year before last, because he was unwilling to be subjected to Westerners' oppression, he resigned and returned to Shanghai. Coincidentally, Mr. Dong Tifang, general manager of the American Raisin Company, posted an advertisement seeking a manager. Mr. Hao then scraped together 1,000 yuan and went to apply. Unexpectedly, after several days, Mr. Dong embezzled funds and fled due to debt. In addition to being frustrated, he also realized that this industry was not his forte and then accepted a teaching position at Zhongfu School in Baoying at the invitation of a friend. Furthermore, because the school was hampered by financial difficulties, it accumulated teachers' salaries, making it impossible to sustain. Mr. Hao also returned to Shanghai in debt. This summer vacation, he again accepted a private tutoring position at the invitation of a friend. However, usually because of</p>

<p>He often felt deep sighs. Before his suicide, Mr. Hao was very clear-minded and his considerations were quite thorough. He had suicide notes for his elderly father and his close friends, with vague and ambiguous wording, as if he did not want people to know the news of his death. However, in the letter to Ren Jinping, he attached a final letter detailing</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Cause of Death <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>With extremely tragic words. According to his friends' speculation, the amount of Mr. Hao's debt was less than 2,000 yuan. Although the circumstances were terrible, this would definitely not have led to suicide. The reason he committed suicide must have been due to a momentary feeling. It seems that Mr. Hao, Ms. Fu Yu, and Ms. Fu Yu's husband and brother had been friends for over a decade. He usually provided Ms. Fu Yu with a great deal of assistance. After failing at roulette, he must have regretted damaging his</p>

<p>And not having the face to tell his friends, this was the major reason for his suicide. Mr. Hao's elderly father, after confirming that Mr. Hao had indeed committed suicide,</p>

<p>Writing a eulogy to hang before the spirit tablet to express his grief. His youngest son, Hao Gengsheng, is an overseas student in the United States and currently serves as the director of the physical education department at Northeastern University in Fengtian. Recently, he designed many of the physical education development plans for Northeast China. There has already been a telegram sent to his relatives, entrusting them to comfort his elderly father, and he will be able to come to Shanghai within a few days. Attached below are Mr. Hao's suicide note and Mr. Hao's father's eulogy.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Suicide Note <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Brother, I am now dead. Before dying, I originally had plans to run away, but the terrible circumstances did not allow for any leniency, inevitably forcing me to die. This is truly a helpless matter. Younger brother, you are my confidant, so close that we are like flesh and blood. Therefore, although I did not want others to know of my death, I cannot but say this first. I only hope that this matter will not be made public to others, and that you will understand my suffering and not blame me. I have a friend who, because he could not maintain his business, which had already closed down, wanted to raise 500 yuan to settle debts and rebuild his business. However, in a period of one month, expending nine years and two tigers' worth of effort, he only obtained 150 yuan. Because the funds obtained were of no use, he had a desire for luck and sought to make a desperate gamble. He came to ask me to go with him. I was especially foolish and went with him. Unexpectedly, this sum of money obtained with great difficulty was completely taken by the casino's income in the blink of an eye. After the friend suffered this setback, his mind was not right and he wanted to commit suicide. I then tried to stop him and ran to Wang Erdao's house to borrow the remaining 50 yuan in tuition fees. I went to the casino again, hoping to try my luck, but unfortunately, I still lost. My friend's desire to commit suicide then became even more determined. Although there had been discussions about running away, in the end, there was no way to go and there was only one death. Because I could not save my friend's death, nor could I disregard my friend's death. Moreover, after my friend's death, I, who jointly created this cause of death, was still living alone. Not only did I have no face to see my friend's family and the friends who knew us both, but I also had no way to comfort my conscience. In the deep of the night, I felt that, apart from my parents, there was nothing that could make me stay. My former ambition had long since dissipated, so the result that no one can escape, I advanced the deadline to shorten the pain of economic oppression, which may not have been an unpleasant thing. Calculating that when this letter reaches you, brother and my friend will have both followed Poseidon on a journey to paradise. After you receive this letter, you will definitely deeply blame me for not telling you, but I know that your plight is no different from mine, and your responsibility is heavy, and the amount of your debt is dozens of times greater than mine. Although 150 yuan could be raised with effort, I could not bear to add to my brother's burden with this improper failure. Moreover, even if I got 150 yuan, it could only relieve my responsibility and may not be able to save my friend's death. Rather than seeing my friend die and living, it is better to stay away from the evil environment and die. I am now dead. With the evil forces of the environment, I will not be able to help you in the future. Brother, you should congratulate me and never be sad for me. Brother, you have extraordinary talent and extraordinary perseverance. You have been fighting against the evil environment for four or five years, and this evil environment has never been able to do anything to you, so the final victory must be near at hand. I hope that you will continue your usual advocacy and forge ahead bravely, so that I can see the environment that killed me and be overcome by my brother in the afterlife. If the soul is conscious, it must be happy. The future is great, I hope you will take care of yourself and pray for you to comfort our elderly father from time to time, so that he will not be too sad. Crying out at the moment of death is the ultimate trust. The place where we die is outside the mouth of Wusong, and the bodies will soon go away with the waves, so there is no need to search for them meaninglessly. Sea burial is better than land burial, which occupies land. Brother knows, Le Li</p>

<h3 id="e227">Opens a Roulette Gambling Den <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Müller Fined Three Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Gambling Patrons Hired are Fined Separately</p>
<p>A Romanian man named Müller recently set up a private roulette gambling den in a Western-style house at No. 47 Rue Massenet in the French Concession, hiring ten Chinese people, Ji Ruiqing, Zhong Bohua, Wang Yongfu, Long Er, Zhu Bingsheng, Wang Xueshan, Bian Shuanggui, Xu Ajin, Chen Zhonglin, and Qiu Gensheng, to serve as hosts and other positions inside. Afterwards, Western Detective of the French Police Department, after learning of the situation, led detectives Xu Fuqing, Li Liansheng, and others to raid the location the night before, seizing two sets of roulette gambling equipment, more than 1,000 yuan in cash, and taking the owner, employees, and gamblers to the police station. After questioning them, the police chief ordered Müller and others to post bail, lightly fined the gamblers, and dismissed them. Yesterday, they were taken to the French court for further investigation. First, the Western detective reported the previous situation and presented the gambling equipment and silver dollars as evidence. When questioned, Müller confessed to running a private gambling operation. When questioned, Ji Ruiqing and others confessed to being hired by Müller to work inside as civilians, and the remaining confessions were evasive. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Müller to a fine of 3,000 yuan, Ji Ruiqing, Zhong Bohua, and Wang Yongfu to a fine of 200 yuan each, and the rest to a fine of 50 yuan each, all to be confiscated. The seized gambling equipment and silver dollars were also confiscated. The former Yueyu Lane</p>

<p>Zhao Guangzuo is Infatuated with Mei Fei</p>
<p>His Wife Files a Criminal Complaint</p>
<p>Mei Fei, formerly a prostitute in Yueyu Lane on Guangxi Road, now named Chen Junxia, has recently been criminally charged in the Special District Court by Zhao Tan Meiying, the wife of local resident Zhao Guangzuo, for embezzlement of an ownership certificate for a car with the intent to defraud. She claims that since her husband, Zhao Guangzuo, began visiting the defendant, the defendant has enticed him, preventing him from returning home day and night. In less than half a year, he has spent over ten thousand yuan. This spring, relatives, seeing that Guangzuo was young and easily led astray, strongly advocated for marrying the plaintiff in order to persuade him. Unexpectedly, on the night of the wedding, Guangzuo was summoned by the defendant, and his small savings were transferred overnight. Until the end of June this year, the defendant incited Guangzuo to buy a new car, causing him to take the family's ancestral ownership certificate and mortgage it outside for her own free use. Guangzuo is surrounded by the defendant's charms, indulging himself all day long, with his mind confused and his judgment lost. She even dares to instigate Guangzuo to send a letter to the plaintiff, demanding a divorce in order to achieve her cunning plan to break up the family. If this is not punished, how can law, reason, and human sentiment be maintained? She demands legal punishment, etc. It is reported that the court has already summoned them for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Two British Deserters Captured <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 11:00 AM, two foreign soldiers, wearing incomplete uniforms, suddenly came rushing along the riverside of Caojiadu Creek in Western Shanghai, appearing extremely flustered and panicked. Coincidentally, a Jiangbei sampan was parked on the shore nearby. The two soldiers immediately jumped aboard, determined to raise the anchor and set sail, as if trying to escape. Liu Yongsheng, a patrol officer stationed at the Yongyu Yarn Factory in Beihang, dispatched by the Sixth District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, saw this and immediately stepped forward to capture the two foreign soldiers and take them back to the district. District Chief Ren questioned them, and the two soldiers confessed that one was named Taolun (transliteration) and the other was named Lintie (transliteration), both of British nationality, serving as soldiers in the British barracks at the Zhaofeng Garden on Jessfield Road. Currently, they were being confined in the barracks for committing offenses, so they took the opportunity to escape, intending to go elsewhere, etc. After obtaining their confessions, District Chief Ren, considering that the two British soldiers were escapees who had committed offenses, should be handed over to the relevant authorities for questioning and punishment in accordance with international practice. In addition to immediately reporting the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau by telephone for record-keeping, he also notified the head of the Jing'an Temple Police Station to dispatch Deputy Police Officer No. 208 to take the two British deserters back to the police station for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e230">The Dingxing and Ruifeng Sands are Robbed <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Wang Buyun, the head of Dingxing Sand Duck Nest Sand (i.e., Shitou Sand) outside the mouth of Wusong, his son, and five farmers including Shi Shangzhi, were previously kidnapped by Chen Guoliang, Wang Youcai, Zhang Jinliu, and other water police squad leaders from the 17th squad of the Wusong Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team stationed near Ruifeng Sand, who colluded with bandits. After the people's corps of the two sands and others suspected that Huang Yutang, the patrol officer who supervised the police, and water police Gong Xibao, Wang Luncai, Zhou Chongquan, Peng Jie, and others were involved, they detained Huang and others and sent them to the Baoshan County government for trial. It was repeatedly reported in this newspaper. However, the three escaped policemen, Chen Guoliang, Wang Youcai, and Zhang Jinliu, along with two bandits, once again rode a sailboat to Dingxing Sand around 1:30 PM the day before yesterday to carry out a major robbery. Before leaving, they also twisted the arms of the two sand residents, Gong Daosheng and Tang Fugen, and asked who had ordered them to kidnap Wang Buyun, his son, and others. The people's corps of the two sands sent Patrol Officer Wang and others to the Baoshan County government, asking them to explain quickly who was behind it. Gong and Tang both replied that they really did not know anything about this matter, kneeling on the ground and begging to be released. Chen Guoliang was furious upon hearing that the two were unwilling to tell the truth, and shot Gong Daosheng twice with a handgun, one bullet grazing his neck and the other hitting his left shoulder. At that moment, Gong was injured and fell to the ground. Tang Fugen was ordered by Chen to be stabbed three times in his left arm and thigh with a bayonet by another bandit, also falling to the ground in a pool of blood. Chen then led his gang, carrying the loot, onto the bandit boat and turned to Ruifeng Sand to loot, then sailed towards the open sea and escaped. It is now learned that the residents of these sands are mostly farmers, and most are poor. Therefore, Chen Guoliang and others actually only robbed more than 400 yuan in cash from the two sands, along with clothing and other items, totaling about 1,000 yuan. Because the sands are located in the sea, in addition to a patrol boat dispatched by the Fourth District Water Police stationed there, there are no other security agencies. Therefore, when Chen and others committed the robbery, the general residents all fled and hid in the reeds, allowing them to search and rob at will and leave leisurely. The escaped policemen Chen Guoliang, Wang Youcai, and Zhang Jinfang all used handguns, while the two bandits carried Mauser rifles, but they were all wearing military uniforms, resembling regular troops. After the incident, the people's corps of Dingxing, Ruifeng, and Ping'an Shitou Sands selected representatives to go to the Baoshan County government at around 10:00 AM yesterday to submit a complaint describing the incident and requesting that police be dispatched quickly to protect the area and arrest the bandits. County Chief Qiu, upon receiving the report, immediately consulted with Zhang Han, the district chief of the Fourth District Water Police, requesting that a patrol ship be dispatched for protection. As for the five hostages, Wang Buyun and Shi Shangzhi, the Wang and Shi families have now received letters from the bandits demanding 50,000 yuan for their ransom, with the ransom for Wang Buyun and his son being 20,000 yuan. However, each family cannot raise this huge sum, so they have not yet negotiated with the bandits.</p>

<p>— Wang Zongzhou</p>
<p>True love often leads to tragic dramas.</p>
<p>The joy of marriage is far less than the joy of divorce.</p>
<p>A woman feels humiliated when oppressed by a man, while a man feels honored when oppressed by a woman.</p>
<p>If school authorities forbid students from exchanging love letters, then Chinese language teachers will have nothing to eat.</p>
<p>Being in the whirlpool of love is like hovering between heaven and hell.</p>
<p>If you fail at something, as long as you struggle with the cause of the failure, you can eventually succeed.</p>
<p>When striving forward, you must not look back, but after reaching your goal, you must look back.</p>
<p>Changing one's tune due to attacks from public opinion shows a complete lack of understanding of the true meaning of love.</p>
<p>The source of suicide often flows with women who are rich in emotion.</p>
<h3 id="e234">A Brief Stay at Mogan Mountain (3) <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Jingbo</p>
<p>The number of visitors to the mountains this summer to escape the heat has increased several times compared to last year. There are reasons for this. The current situation is turbulent, and the clouds of war are looming. Mount Lu is in a dangerous area, and Western merchants who had appointments there cannot travel. Many of them come to the mountains together. In previous years, Westerners from Shanghai thought that the three islands of Japan were beautiful, and they lingered in Hakone and Unzen. Now, because silver is cheap and gold is expensive, it is difficult to expect a reservation. Therefore, tourists flock to Mogan Mountain, reaching a peak for a time. In terms of accommodation in the mountains, besides the railway hotel, Westerners mostly rent houses. After I went to Hangzhou, I learned that there were no more rooms available in the hotel, so I dared not go to the mountains hastily. Later, after several telegrams with the China Travel Service, I finally got a place to stay. After this, I saw several guests come to the mountains, but they left after a meal because there were no more rooms available, which was also disappointing. The best things in the mountains are bamboo and springs. Bamboo is everywhere in the mountains, and the springs are also tinkling and pleasant to the ear. The scenery in the morning and evening is also constantly changing, making it impossible to explore. Zhou Mengpo has an article describing the scenery of the mountains, saying, "Mogan Mountain was named in the Zhou Dynasty because the King of Wu cast swords there. The peaks stand tall and can reach the sky. Sometimes thunder rumbles underfoot, and clouds rise in the urn. Sometimes springs fly from outside the sky, and waterfalls fall by the pillow. In the morning, sweat flows and fans are waved. In the evening, clothes are thin and cotton is put on. As Su Dongpo said, 'I do not know the true face of Mount Lu.' It is not that one does not really know it, but that it changes in an instant, and everything is shifted by the wind and clouds. Mogan Mountain is also like this. The mountains are planted with bamboo, tall, low, big, and small, each gathered by type, connecting the mountains and bordering the territory, not just thousands of acres of the Wei River. This is what Mount Lu, Beidaihe, and Chicken Foot Mountain cannot match. It is worth the travel of people from China and abroad who admire it with their hearts and focus on it with their eyes." I stayed in the mountains for a short time and never waved a fan or sweated. The so-called sweat flowing and fans being waved in the morning is not entirely true. However, Mengpo's article describes the scenery of the mountains in great detail.</p>
<h3 id="e235">A Glimpse of the Tragic Situation of the People of Henan <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Rouyun</p>
<p>The Central Plains of Henan was right in the path of the North-South war. Since the Republic, there has hardly been a day of peace. In addition to the disasters of war, there have been natural disasters. Recently, a friend came from Kaifeng and described the tragic situation there as follows. Hearing it in Shanghai made my heart ache, and I grieved for my compatriots, who have no way to live. Therefore, I will describe the outline of the situation below to tell the people of the country.</p>
<p>Flies as Big as Bees: For now, let us leave aside the war and only discuss the natural disasters. This alone is enough to drain the marrow and blood of the people of Henan, and there is more than enough left. Locusts and incessant rain followed the war. The fields were barren and the land was red for thousands of miles. Poor families had not heard of rice and wheat for years. They dug up grass roots and tree bark to eat, but even the grass roots and tree bark were almost completely dug up. Large families, in order to maintain their lives, had to sell their sons and daughters for one or two yuan in order to seek a full meal. Flesh and blood were scattered and turned in the ditches. The tragic situation was like this. Since the beginning of summer, a kind of fly as big as a bee has suddenly been discovered in the area along the Longhai Railway war zone. The body structure of the fly is no different from the usual ones, but the body of the fly is especially large and has a needle-like sting like a bee. According to those who know, this kind of large fly is formed by the bones and blood of the dead rotting on the sand field. The flies first appeared near the battlefield and then spread everywhere, with the sting causing pain that pierces the heart and lungs. Some people in Henan hide in small rooms all day long to avoid the poisonous sting, which is also said to be suffering.</p>
<p>Four County Magistrates in One County: In addition to suffering from this kind of insect poison, the people of Henan also suffer from so-called human poison, which is an even more substantial pain. When troops pass through a county, they must carry out a looting. After satisfying their desires, they set off. The troops in Henan are no different from locusts on rice. If looting is not enough, they will appoint their own trusted county magistrates as a means of collecting taxes. When Team A passes through, they appoint B as the county magistrate. When Team C passes through, they appoint D as the county magistrate. A certain county, known for its fertility, now has four different county magistrates. When a new county magistrate takes office, there must be a new arrangement. Various taxes are levied under cleverly established names, which are too many to count. Each county magistrate has their own method of collecting money. Political orders come from many sources, and there is nowhere to turn. Human poison is also very terrible.</p>
<p>Rouyun Said: The people of Henan are suffering like water that is deep and fire that is hot. The people of that place are looking forward to the arrival of government troops to alleviate their suffering. I deeply hope that the anti-rebel soldiers at the front will bravely advance and save the people of Henan from the fire and water.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Movies in the Sweltering Heat <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Jiade</p>
<p>The summer heat torments people, and it is difficult to pass the long days. Preparing ice and cutting melons can alleviate the heat a little, but the mental fatigue is really impossible to get rid of. I am addicted to the cinema and only use watching movies to amuse myself. The Shanghai cinemas that have air conditioning equipment are the Nanjing and Guanglu theaters. However, staying there for only two hours is very cool, but when you come out of the theater, you feel the heat even more intensely. For outdoor movies at night, the time is not suitable. I heard that the business of cinemas declines during the summer because they are all affected by the weather.</p>
<p>However, the excitement of enjoying a good film is still strong. I remember when the film "Laihun" was screened for the second time, it was also in the height of summer, but the seats were full. Even though we were sweating profusely, we didn't feel the heat. Especially the snow and ice scenes in the film made people unintentionally forget the heat outside the theater and feel like they were enjoying the coolness in the film. Thinking about it now, I still have a lingering taste. Also, I went to see the film "The Gold Rush" several times. When it was screened in Beijing last summer, it was still full. In the midst of laughter, I saw the snow scenes and didn't feel the bleak and desolate background. Otherwise, watching a film of the Great War, on the battlefield and under the artillery fire, you would feel like you were there and would be unbearable.</p>
<p>Many of the recent domestic films are action films. The shadows of swords and the light of knives are extremely tense, but watching them in the summer heat always feels unpleasant. I heard that the Mingxing Film Company has recently produced a long film "Taohua Lake," directed by Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu. The film describes an emotional story in a sorrowful tone, and it is more subtle and delicate than the films "Baiyun Pagoda" and "Meihua Luo." The first episode of the film depicts exotic scenery, using Kulun as the background. The snowy landscape is full of poetic meaning, and the scenery is rarely seen on such a grand scale. I heard that the film has been completed and will be screened soon. The silver light and snow shadows should be able to dispel the accumulated heat in the heart.</p>
<p>I remember that Soreen Play magazine once published a June special issue, in which the text and pictures were all taken from the lives of movie stars escaping the summer heat and the snow and ice scenes in the films. Holding one in hand, you can forget the afternoon fatigue. It can be seen that when watching movies in the summer, the background of the film should be taken into consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e237">A Primary School Teacher Who Sells Toads <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>Can Earn 4,000 Wen Per Day</p>
<p>In recent years, primary school teachers in various places have taken up side jobs such as pulling rickshaws and barbering because their salaries are too low to maintain their livelihoods. Such reports have been published in the newspapers from time to time, and those who see them all use them as conversation pieces. However, there has been no one like Mr. Zhu of our county (Nanhui) who specializes in selling toads as a way to make money, which is especially unique. I will briefly outline the situation below to tell those who care about education and people's livelihood issues.</p>
<p>Zhu Huisheng of Shenzhuang Town, Nanhui County, is a certified teacher. According to the regulations of the Education Bureau of our county, all certified teachers receive a third-class salary of 18 yuan per month, including food expenses. In this era of rising prices, the price of rice has risen to more than 20 yuan per stone. Without being intelligent, one would know that it is difficult to use this small income to provide for the clothing and food of oneself and one's family. Mr. Zhu, realizing that the bread problem has entered a dangerous situation and that the solution cannot be delayed, resolutely abandoned his important responsibility of cultivating the future masters of the country. Every day, he goes barefoot to the fields to catch a large number of toads, cuts them open, skins them, washes them in clean water, and adds five books of Chen wine, soy sauce, and other ingredients to cook them in a pot. He carries them to various towns to sell. The people in the market compete to buy them because they are fat, tender, and delicious, no less than frog meat. According to what Mr. Zhu told people, he can earn a net profit of more than 4,000 wen per day, which is more than double the salary of a teacher. Long believes that Mr. Zhu is able to adapt to circumstances and open up new ways of making money, which is a wise thing to do. But I don't know what kind of new plans he will invent when there is a shortage of toads in the future, which makes other teachers who value their status and are rigid and uncompromising feel pitiful as they sit in their sorrowful cities all day long.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Trivial Notes from Dancheng <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Mengdie</p>
<p>It has been several years since my footsteps last trod Dancheng. In the last days of the seventh month of this year, I was wearily suffering from summer heat in Xishan, when Lin Youmei, a fellow townsman, urgently invited me with a specially delivered letter to the inaugural exhibition of the Qingyun Calligraphy and Painting Society, which he had founded, hoping for me to take a look. Moved by his friendship, my homesickness stirred, and I mustered the courage to embark on the journey. It was deep into the night when I arrived, as the train I took that day was delayed along the way, nominally an express train but actually exceptionally slow. The night was pitch black, and the station had poor lighting. After getting off, I groped my way to the city gate before finally finding a rickshaw puller, boarded his rickshaw, and went straight to the residence of my old friend Jiang Mengfei on Taiping Bridge. Having not visited for several years, I was quite disoriented. Initially, I intended to get off at the bridge, but I traveled for a long time without seeing it. Upon asking the locals, I learned that Taiping Bridge had already been leveled. It turned out that Taiping was originally a dry bridge, and it was removed to prevent traffic obstruction. This is a small example of the changes of hills and valleys, a minor vicissitude of life.</p>
<p>The next morning, Mengfei and two other guests accompanied me to the society to meet the society head, Youmei, and his elder brother Youyun. They then led me to the exhibition, which was held in the silk shop guild hall at Ma Lane Gate. The day was the height of the summer heat, and I sweated profusely, finding it unbearable. However, the hall's buildings were tall and spacious, providing a cool respite from the heat, as it was the former residence of the local gentry, the Shu family. However, in a short time, my emotions were stirred, as the displayed calligraphy and paintings by famous artists numbered over two hundred pieces, all collected and mounted by Youmei alone, forming this grand spectacle. His grand ambition and perseverance are truly astonishing and admirable. Although I have dabbled in calligraphy in recent years, haphazardly painting here and there, I have never truly practiced the fundamentals and do not have confidence in my skills. However, there are many who appreciate my works, mistakenly lauding my reputation, and constantly requesting my services. Writing fans during the summer season is an especially timely task. Often, wherever I go, I am sweating and working. Among the exhibits, there is also a scroll of cursive script, only displayed because the society head admired it and would not allow me to hide my inadequacies. The Lin brothers also hosted a banquet at the exhibition, extending the utmost hospitality. As a wanderer far from home, finding myself unable to return home, I was able to gather with these old friends and new acquaintances, and my feelings of gratitude and comfort were beyond description.</p>
<p>On the day of departure, I made a small detour to visit an acquaintance. The brief visit inadvertently stirred old feelings, giving me a sense of Du Mu's experience in Huzhou. The beautiful maiden of the past has now become a modern middle-aged woman, her children grown. It is as the saying goes, "Green leaves become shade, branches full of offspring." I also recalled Yan Jidao's poem "Partridge Sky," with the line "Still fearing that meeting is but a dream." The situation was somewhat similar, so I composed a poem in the same meter: "Remembering the beautiful lady in her boudoir, singularly favored, her face like a delicate peach blossom, a deep red. The old promise before the flowers, a spring dream returning. Coming again outside the gate, I sadly lament the evening breeze. Not daring to meet, yet meeting unexpectedly, shocked by the haggard appearance at this moment. Pitying the itinerant lover on the road, on leaving, a warm smile lingering."</p>
<h3 id="e239">New Knowledge for the Family <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Compiled by Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>I once read an article in a commercial journal stating that magnesium carbonate could extinguish fire, but I did not take it to heart. During the Lantern Festival, at a makeup pavilion in Huayuqi, a table was set up near the bed, with a carpet laid on the floor. The table was covered with a cloth blanket, and there was barely any space for the dishes and plates. The food was abundant, and the guests were all good drinkers, so the cups were filled with brandy. Each person's place setting also had a wrinkled paper printed handkerchief, folded into the shape of a concentric square knot. The electric lamp was covered with a large silk shade, adorned with red silk tassels, hanging low near the table, no more than three feet above. The waiter brought in a chrysanthemum hotpot, pouring flaming liquor into it. Unexpectedly, the flame ignited the bottle in his hand, causing him to panic and release it. The flaming liquor and bottle landed on the table, causing a fire. The dishes and bowls overturned, and the brandy fueled the flames. If it spread to the floor, the carpet and bed curtains would also catch fire, and the danger was overwhelming. I then noticed a long tube of toothpaste on the dressing table, remembering that magnesium carbonate could reduce fire. I sprinkled it onto the table, and wherever the powder landed, the flames were immediately extinguished, covering all areas, high and low, effectively stopping the disaster. The people in the house fetched water, originally intending to put out the fire, but instead used it to wash the cups and refill them. The remaining food and wine were removed for the servants to enjoy, who praised it and said it had a unique fragrance and was even more delicious. My family used to buy only a few tubes of toothpaste, but after this incident, we now buy a dozen tubes each time and distribute them to each room as insurance. The uses of the "Invincible" brand toothpaste do not mention this function. Is it just a coincidence? (Canghaisheng) Xu writes: The main components of fire extinguishing powder are magnesium carbonate and boric acid. However, toothpaste is light, and when used in the aforementioned situation, it can extinguish fire. For fire protection, it is still advisable to purchase fire extinguishing powder or a fire hose.</p>

<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>(18) The Cost of Living in Tokyo</p>
<p>As material civilization progresses, the cost of living increases. Tokyo is the center of Japanese politics and culture, so the cost of living there is almost on par with Europe and America. Generally, families with a monthly income of 300 Japanese yen or more can barely maintain their living expenses. Housewives personally handle most of the chores, and they live in simple rented houses with few amenities. Otherwise, even a little extravagance will lead to debt. To get to work at companies and associations every day, long-distance trains and public buses are used as convenient modes of transportation. Otherwise, people walk. Cars are hardly considered an option for commuting to work. As for the lower classes, students, and laborers, their lives are supported by the social welfare programs of the social bureaus and the authorities, such as simple canteens and public housing, which are priced very low. Therefore, a minimum income of about 70-80 Japanese yen is enough to support a family and keep them adequately fed. Since the lifting of the gold embargo, the Japanese authorities have adopted a tight monetary policy, doing everything possible to lower the cost of living. The government's power is used to force stores to lower the prices of everyday goods. Therefore, within Japan, the general cost of living has gradually decreased. However, Chinese residents still find it very difficult to live in Tokyo due to the high exchange rate (two Chinese yuan equals about one Japanese yen). The Japanese admire European culture in everything. Eight or nine out of ten men wear Western suits. Japanese also incorporates many English words, and specialized terms are still called by their original English names. Hotel furnishings are purely Western style, with wooden beds, desks, and chairs, similar to the exquisite hotels in China, collectively called "Hoteiru," the transliteration of the English word "Hotel." Ordinary hotel room rates start at three Japanese yen per day and can go up to twenty or thirty yen. Meals are available in the attached dining rooms, which offer both Western and Japanese cuisine for guests to choose from. Breakfast costs one Japanese yen, lunch costs one yen and twenty cents, and dinner costs one yen and a half. Therefore, in terms of food and lodging alone, the average traveler must spend more than ten yen per day. The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo is the most famous, and is frequented by high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants, who spend dozens or even hundreds of yen per day, which is not surprising. There is also a purely Japanese-style inn, where food and lodging are cheaper. The rooms are covered with tatami mats, and the room rate depends on the number of mats. There is a public bathhouse where male and female guests bathe together in the same pool, revealing every detail of their curves. Japanese are used to it and are calm. If Chinese people were to see this, it would be considered a strange tale. There are boundaries in the room. In the Hotel, the bathroom is separate, there is no such pleasure. The Japanese like to be clean and bathe at least once a day. Most middle-class families have their own bathrooms, while ordinary people go to the public bathhouse in the city, which costs only five cents. However, soap and towels must be brought. Men and women are in the same pool, separated by a thin board, which is only a few feet high. If you stand on tiptoe, you can see the naked beauty in full view.</p>

<p>(4) Town Council Expenses</p>
<p>The expenses of the town council vary depending on the size of the area and the amount of funding required. Generally, there are office expenses, transportation subsidies, sanitation expenses, night watch expenses, congratulatory and condolence expenses, festival expenses, and other miscellaneous items. The largest, such as the Aoyama North and South 6-chome Association in Akasaka Ward, has an annual total of 4,472.647 yen. The smallest, such as the Garyu-cho Town Council in Koishikawa Ward, has an annual total of 1,200 yen. The number of members varies, and the most expensive, such as the Koji 5-chome Self-Defense Association in Kojimachi Ward, costs 41.855 yen per member per year. The least expensive, such as the Minami-Iga-cho Town Council in Yotsuya Ward, costs 1.874 yen per member per year.</p>
<p>(5) Town Council Sanitation Association</p>
<p>In Meiji 30, the Japanese government promulgated the Infectious Disease Prevention Law. In February of the 33rd year, the Tokyo Prefecture re-promulgated the regulations for the establishment of sanitation associations. Each town council then established a sanitation association. Among the 15 wards of Tokyo City, excluding Honjo Ward, which is still being organized due to special circumstances, Kojimachi has 8 groups, Kanda has 18 groups, Nihonbashi has 130 groups, Kyobashi has 16 groups, Shiba Ward has 7 groups, Azabu has 20 groups, Akasaka has 1 group, Yotsuya has 58 groups, Ushigome and Koishikawa each have 26 groups, Hongo has 38 groups, Shitaya has 2 groups, Asakusa has 97 groups, and Fukagawa has 1 group, for a total of 445 groups. The most is Nihonbashi Ward, and the least are Akasaka and Fukayama Wards.</p>
<p>(6) Town Council Election Campaigns</p>
<p>Elections for members of the House of Representatives, prefectural assembly members, city council members, and ward assembly members in Japan are all based on the town council as the basic unit of election campaigns. The town council is a small regional community with intimate and mutual assistance. In the past, feelings of affection and mutual assistance were strong, and election campaigns were intimate and easy to succeed. However, in China, the representative system is often criticized for money-based election campaigns. It is not known that election campaigns in Japan, in addition to publicity, are also centered on money. It is said that in the previous election of the House of Representatives, a certain lawyer spent tens of thousands of yen, and the publicity expenses alone were more than 20,000 yen. After the election failed, he fled and his whereabouts are unknown. This kind of money-based election campaign has the same drawbacks as in China. However, the country has a special advantage, that is, in the election competition, although each party does its best, when the election results show that one party has won and the other has failed, the losing party can put the overall national situation first and submit, without insidious sabotage, so that the country's political tranquility is not disturbed. This is why Japan's national strength has been steadily increasing and is following in the footsteps of Europe and the United States to become a strong country in East Asia after the Restoration.</p>
<p>(7) Town Council Federation</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the handling of affairs and expand mutual assistance, town councils have formed town council federations. There are three types of federations: (1) Federation of all town councils within a ward; (2) Federation of town councils from different wards; (3) Federation of town councils with similar primary affairs.</p>

<p>Money market depressed... Jiangnan Silver plummets one cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, banks opened as usual, but a large part of the business news was due to the closure for the summer festival for one day. As a result, only a few Chinese merchant banks were open as usual, but there was no way for funds to circulate, and the market atmosphere became quiet. The money market also felt inferior. The interest rate in the morning market was 7 cents 2 fen 8 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, and the noon market was 7 cents 2 fen 8 li, a slight increase of 2 hao and a half compared to the noon market the previous day. The transaction of remittance and draft was 765,000 in the morning market and 695,000 in the noon market. The banknote transaction was 25,000 in the morning market and 42,000 in the noon market. The off-market banknote transaction was 122,000 in the morning market and 35,000 in the noon market. Banks were closed for business as usual and there was no news. Qianzhuang foreign companies collected more than 3.5 million, and small qianzhuang traded more than 300,000. The silver market opened two minutes in the morning and noon, and the market atmosphere was still loose. The collection was quiet. Qianzhuang silver companies collected more than 4.1 million, and the draft transaction was 6-7 million. Although Chinese small banks slightly improved, most of them were closed and there was no collection, so it was difficult to interview at the time and it was omitted. The Jiangnan silver price of the small qianzhuang suddenly had a major reaction yesterday. The morning market was 6 cents 3 fen 6 li, which was a sharp drop of 1 cent 2 li compared to the morning market the previous day. The noon market rebounded by 2 li to 6 cents 3 fen 8 li, but it still fell by 1 cent. The transaction was 3,500 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong silver price rose sharply to 6 cents 1 fen 5 li in the morning market, and fell back by half a li to 6 cents 1 fen 4 li and a half in the noon market, which was 2 hao and a half better than the noon market the previous day. The transaction was 150,000 jiao in the morning market and 110,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins rose by 1,000 to 391,000.</p>

<p>The silver market has been loose for a long time in July, and the daily interest rate is several points. As a result, the total amount of the statistics is less than half of that in June, only 2 taels 4 qian 6 fen. It was recorded in the newspaper that the interest rate was decided at the previous meeting, and it was said that the bottom price was too low. The total amount is estimated to be no more than 2 taels 5 qian 95 kou. As such, it is also slightly more than half of the June rate, and the highest overdue interest rate is only 10 taels 05 qian. The overdue interest is still added according to the raw plate of 4 taels and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Securities and Bond Markets Remain Sluggish <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai securities market and various bond markets had little spot trading. The total amount of customs bonds opened throughout the day was 11,700 yuan. The futures market was not quiet in the morning, with a total of 4.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, there were only more than 1.51 million yuan, for a total of more than 5.6 million yuan. Among them, the customs and reorganization bonds each had 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan, the disarmament bond had more than 1.2 million yuan, and the rehabilitation bond also had more than 1.1 million yuan. The market was very quiet and deserted. The seven-year financial market had no surface. As for the changes in bond prices, when the customs bonds, reorganization bonds, disarmament bonds, and rehabilitation bonds were first opened in the morning, the buying seemed to be more active and slightly firmer than on the weekend. However, the buying trend returned to calm, and the bond prices instantly fell step by step, lower than the previous week. For example, the futures prices of customs bonds, reorganization bonds, and rehabilitation bonds all fell slightly, while the recent month of the disarmament bond fell by 6 jiao, and the next month's fell by 1 yuan and a half. However, other prices fluctuated, but the fluctuations were extremely small.</p>

<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm at noon. The current yarn sales market is still enthusiastic. The Xuzhou, Guangdong, and Sichuan gangs are searching for goods in the market. The various gangs are very interested. Fortunately, there is still some inventory, and there is no fierce price increase. The situation is still stable, but the buying side is very determined. The inland gangs have a better idea of doing more, because there is hope for a good harvest this year. Therefore, they are buying in the distant months. The selling side has no intention of going short because the situation is still turbulent and the US cotton market is low. At present, the market can still be stable due to good actual sales.</p>

<p>The opening price of Renbiao in the previous market was soft due to the bland US cotton situation. The situation in the market was loose, and there were two major bulls closing out. The prices of each month fell by two, four, six, and seven qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the current yarn business had improved, and the prices of each month rose by one, three, four, and five qian. It was found that Dachang sold 1,900 bales, which was the most, followed by Yiyu with 1,450 bales, Maoji, Zhenda, Yingfeng, Lichang, Heshen, Gongtai, Shenchang, and Jifeng with 700 to 1,200 bales. Taishengkang bought 2,550 bales, followed by Daji with 850 bales, and Dafeng, Yuantai, Tianchang, Shenxin, and Shengtai with 300 to 700 bales. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,300 dan.

It was found that the total number of spot and forward yarn purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 4,920 bales, and 150 bales were entered into the industry. The market price rose by five qian to seven and a half qian. Among the guest gangs, the Guangdong gang bought the most, totaling 1,760 bales.

<p>The cotton market is mediocre because the US cotton situation is bland. The weather has been good for several days, and the new cotton is progressing smoothly. Therefore, people's hearts are softening, and the spot cotton business is quiet. The attitude of the factories is cold, and the Japanese cotton has absorbed enough, so there is no need to purchase it. The market atmosphere is weakening, and Dafeng has a large amount of selling in the futures market, so the market is relaxing again. The cotton market is difficult to rise according to its actual position.</p>

<p>The opening price of Hanbiao in the previous market was that the price of overseas cotton was stable, and some major players were selling at unlimited prices, and the amount was huge. The prices of each month fell by one and a half to two and a half qian. In the afternoon, the market was weak, and the near months fell by five points, while the distant months were flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,800 dan. It was found that Dafeng sold the most, with 7,500 dan, followed by Maoji with 7,100 dan, Lichang, Dafu, Qinfeng, and Jinfeng with 1,000 to 1,900 dan. Yuda, Shenchang, Tianchang, Yicheng, Xinheng, Yuanda, Yuchang, and Ruida bought 1,000 to 1,700 dan. The closing price of Hanbiao is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm at first due to bad weather, but then it weakened due to the liquidation of some bulls and the estimate of cotton harvest being favorable to sellers.

<h3 id="e254">Business of the American Cotton Cooperative <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the American government established the Agricultural Bureau and organized the American Cotton Cooperative to maintain cotton prices. The authority of the Agricultural Bureau and the contents of the cooperative have been previously reported in this newspaper. The contents of the cooperative are particularly noteworthy. According to the "International Cotton Quarterly," Mr. Nodington, President of the Alabama American Cotton Cooperative, wrote an article entitled "The American Cotton Cooperative," which is translated directly below to observe its content. The American Cotton Cooperative is a national organization of cotton cooperatives, recognized by the Federal Agricultural Bureau, and its form is also approved by the Agricultural Bureau. The cooperative's authorized capital is 30 million yuan, and according to its articles of association, it may act as the general sales manager for the cotton sales of its members' marketing organizations. All cotton cooperatives, except for the Greenwood Standard Cotton Cooperative in Mississippi, are members and beneficiaries of the cooperative's achievements. For the sake of analysis, the cooperative's business can be divided into three different types.</p>
<p>(1) As the national cotton cooperative is the central organization for cotton cooperative members, it directly promotes the sale of all cotton owned by its branches. As the Agricultural Bureau uses financial cooperation to manage the cotton cooperative business, it provides loans to cooperative members for the following purposes: A. Lending to maintain the market, that is, state cooperatives provide loans to cotton farmers when they deliver cotton. B. Lending to state cooperatives to purchase material conveniences, such as purchasing warehouses, packing plants, and cotton gins. C. Lending to state cooperatives to subscribe to stocks of agricultural product lending companies. However, the cooperative should not lend to lending companies for the purpose of agricultural product lending, as such funds must come from third-party lending institutions or commercial banks. The scale of the lending relationship between the national cotton cooperative and state cooperatives depends on the need for funds and the collateral that state cooperatives can submit to the cooperative and the Agricultural Bureau. The affairs of the national cooperative will also realize the Agricultural Bureau's policy of organizing, educating, and cooperating among cotton planters, bankers, and merchants, and other key measures that are essential for the success of the entire movement. This type of business has the following key points related to the public: (1) Expanding the number of members of state cooperatives; (2) Striving to make American cotton production correspond to world demand in terms of quantity; (3) Improving the quality of American cotton to maintain the superiority of American cotton production and to seek the highest possible price commensurate with the quality of American cotton for cotton planters.</p>
<p>(2) The American Cotton Cooperative will buy and sell cotton. Whenever the cooperative and the authorities of the Agricultural Bureau believe that it is necessary to correct any errors in the cotton belt or that it is extremely beneficial to the members, the cooperative will buy and sell cotton based on the total contribution of all state branches. In other words, any private cotton merchant may buy and sell cotton domestically or abroad, or buy and sell spot cotton or futures cotton. The American Cotton Cooperative also has this right to buy and sell. When it is necessary to correct market conditions caused by manipulated or unevenly positioned long or short positions, the cooperative headquarters can deliver or take delivery of cotton on any futures market. Whether the cooperative will exercise this power and to what extent will be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>(3) The primary task of the American Cotton Cooperative is to act in concert with the Agricultural Bureau in the name of a legally established cotton industry maintenance association. The maintenance function is only intended to be exercised when the situation is urgent, market conditions are special, and supply and demand and prices are affected. According to the provisions of this law, the general cooperative can use the financial assistance of the Agricultural Bureau to purchase and store cotton on the cotton market in an amount sufficient to stabilize the market price.</p>
<p>If cotton farmers insist on planting more cotton fields and harvesting more cotton, the Agricultural Bureau will naturally not be able to protect prices forever, and it will not be able to maintain them for a considerable period of time. This is a simple matter of reason. If the climate is very good, the cotton crop is very smooth, and the yield per acre is extraordinarily high, the Agricultural Bureau can certainly help cotton farmers to avoid bankruptcy due to the abundance of cotton harvests and to maintain the position of sellers. However, if the number of cotton fields exceeds the bounds of conservative reason, resulting in an extraordinarily abundant harvest, the Agricultural Bureau has long warned cotton farmers that in the event of such a situation, the bureau will be economically powerless to help. It is easier to limit excessive planting beforehand than to deal with it afterwards. Those with knowledge can understand this. Therefore, the Agricultural Bureau and the Cooperative are now requesting planters and those involved in the southern cotton industry to cooperate with them to reduce cotton planting, and at the same time, these two organizations are also requesting planters to produce high-quality cotton in all cotton planting areas of the South. This is because this measure is not only related to the value of the 1930 cotton crop, but also to the level of future cotton crop values and the prosperity or decline of the general cotton industry. What is now sought from the people in the national cotton industry is to unite with each other to become a whole, organized South to produce cotton, the quantity and quality of which must be most suitable for the needs of the world, and to sell their products in a way that obtains the highest possible selling price commensurate with world commercial conditions and cotton supply.

<p>Spot demand was quieter last week. Mainland exporters purchased Oomra cotton, but there were not many new transactions. Local factories had no transactions due to poor demand for yarn and cloth. Futures were stable. The price difference between Oomra and Pingor cotton and American cotton is favorable. If the political situation improves, the price difference is expected to narrow. Cotton harvests in the United Provinces and Punjab have made good progress. The Sindh region has been damaged by river flooding. The situation for Oomra is generally unfavorable and needs rainfall.</p>

<p>Ordinary Japonica has reached 21 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported rice can report the impact of transshipment.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Zhabei <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The number of goods arriving from the mainland yesterday was sparse, and accumulated goods downstream were gradually decreasing. Sales in the streets were quite brisk, with white japonica being the most popular. Since imported rice has been able to report transshipment, people's confidence has greatly increased, so all factory and warehouse stocks are reluctant to sell, and boat japonica sales are particularly strong, so broken japonica prices are rising steadily, and they rose another two or three cents yesterday. Ordinary medium and upper grades of customs goods have now reached 21 yuan. Although the market for top-grade special japonica is scarce, quotations inevitably exceed the limit. Therefore, it is heard that the authorities are gradually paying attention. The arrival of Dongxin japonica is dwindling, and large lots are still quoted at 20 yuan, but there has been a slight increase in medium-grade goods, but transactions are extremely rare. The spot market has become tighter and buying interest is brisk, with prices rising by a half cent, but high-grade goods are exhausted, so ordinary yuan are very active. Arrivals of thin rice stocks are low, and demand is high, but the market is slightly firmer than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e259">South Shanghai <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The number of boats arriving from downstream is still low, and spot sales are acceptable. Common grades such as Changjing and Sutong machine-processed white japonica are active in the market. The source of supply is insufficient, and sales are mainly to shops and rural areas, but most buyers are quoting high prices, and buyers are turning to wait-and-see due to high prices, so a stalemate formed in the morning, and transactions were slightly made later, and prices saw a rise of about a cent. Arrivals of southern thin rice stocks are even lower, and the market is quite good, but there are no transactions because of the small amount of goods. Arrivals of mutton tallow japonica are also sparse, and the trend is firm due to the rise in imported rice, but warehouse stocks still want to wait and see. Arrivals of substitute yuan are slightly higher, but the market is calm and the situation is not as fresh as the northern market. Large lots are still sluggish. According to the report, the japonica situation in both the north and south markets is very tight all day, and prices are now starting to rise again.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Up Two Cents This Morning</p>
<h3 id="e260">North China Dealers Initiate Trading <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Imported rice sales were still good this morning because North China has opened up. Although North China dealers have not made major moves, customers in Tianjin, Dalian, and other cities have been buying in the market, and people's confidence has been active, and the market price has immediately risen by two cents. The following transactions were recorded: 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at 17 yuan 1 cent, then 16 yuan 7 cents; then 500 bags of No. 2 rice at 14 yuan 1.5 cents; 400 bags of small broken rice at 15 yuan 1 cent; then 1,000 bags of brown rice at 12 yuan 5.5 cents to 11 yuan; 500 bags of large broken rice at 13 yuan 1 cent; 300 bags of Min Dang rice at 15 yuan 5.6 cents; 200 bags of Dawei rice at 15 yuan 6.7 cents; and 300 bags of Xu Ye brown rice at 13 yuan 7.5 cents. The Saigon rice was purchased by Tianjin dealers, the large broken rice by Dalian dealers, the brown rice by inland dealers, and other rice by local street and village dealers. However, sales were sluggish again in the afternoon, and Tianjin dealers did not make many more purchases because market prices were not favorable, and the market situation reverted to a flat trend.</p>
<p>Flour Market Falls Again</p>
<p>Export Rumors Not Yet Realized</p>
<p>Factory Owners Liquidate Long Positions</p>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, the current month's flour saw short covering due to outside speculators fearing that flour exports would be implemented in the future, which would inevitably cause squeezes. However, the market loosened afterwards as factory owners had differing opinions. Those who were bullish were still thinking of raising prices using the export rumors, while those who were bearish thought that the matter was just a rumor and that implementation would be difficult, so they continued to liquidate positions. When the market opened in the afternoon, small and medium-sized factory owners were still liquidating positions, and inland long positions also took the opportunity to liquidate, so prices fell again. Looking ahead, if exports are still pending, the market must continue to fluctuate and it will be difficult to fall. As a result, the current month's closing price fell by 1 cent compared to the previous week, September fell by a small 1 cent 2.5 mills, October fell by a small 1 cent 1 mill, November fell by a small 1 cent 2.5 mills, December fell by a small 1 cent 5 mills, and January fell by a small 1 cent.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Wheat Futures Fluctuate, Spot Market Calm <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday afternoon, the prices for all months fluctuated because the price of imported wheat was slightly lower by one or two cents, and the rumor of flour exports had not yet been realized, so most people's confidence was moderate. In short, the rise and fall of the wheat market is particularly dependent on whether flour exports will occur. As a result, the current month was up by a large 2 cents from the previous week, September and October were down by a small amount, November was up by 1 cent, December was down by 1 cent, and January was up 1 cent in the morning, and there was no opening in the afternoon. The spot market remained calm. However, as high-grade goods are becoming increasingly scarce, and factories are unwilling to accept medium-grade goods, customers have no intention of purchasing them, so future wheat futures will have to retreat. 3,500 bags of sorghum from Taierzhuang Yaozai and yellow buckwheat from Hankou were distributed to various factories.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Silk Flowers, Level Water, Bulk Sales to US Continue <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign merchant tea market saw continuing brisk sales of level water bulk green tea from Huzhou, Shaoxing, and other regions to American merchants. Total market turnover exceeded 3,000 cases, with prices ranging from 37 taels 5 qian to 39 taels 5 qian. The market price still failed to rise. The market for Luzhuang green tea Zhenmei was still sluggish. Although transactions for needle eyebrow and gongxi goods were not quiet, dealers' bidding was very tight, and the market momentum did not improve. As for Keemun black tea, except for the floral fragrance category, which Russian merchants continued to purchase, the rest were sluggish.</p>

<p>Farmers in the four townships of Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, are now nearing the end of their agricultural work. Although the harvests in the spring and summer seasons of this year were not abundant, the price of cocoons was relatively high, and they all made a profit. Therefore, their interest in raising autumn silkworms is quite strong, and they have already started hatching the seeds. It is estimated that the number of autumn silkworms raised this year will be more than double the amount of spring cocoons.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 4th) was the summer holiday period for local Chinese and foreign banks, and foreign firms also followed the example and stopped operations. There was no silk or yarn market at all.</p>

<p>Has not been affected by the current situation in recent days and is showing an upward trend. The reasons for this are: firstly, demand from the Northeast region is still strong; secondly, various factories have experienced strikes from time to time; and thirdly, the demand for military uniforms is very strong. Yesterday, over 300 pieces of 11-pound coarse cloth were traded, and all brands rose by 5 cents. Therefore, confidence is strong. Sales of fine cloth to various Northeast regions are still active. Brands such as Yanghe, Caiqiu, and Blue Double Fish have risen another 2.5 cents. However, demand from ports such as Shantou and Xiamen in Guangdong is not as strong as before, so they are slightly weaker, but asking prices have not changed much.</p>

<p>Have been greatly affected since the riots in Changsha. Trade with the Yangtze River region has plummeted. In addition, Eastern goods are arriving in force, causing confidence to be very weak, and prices are falling step by step. Yesterday, Huxinting fine broadcloth opened at 2 qian 4 fen 7 li 5 hao. Shuanglong shuilang continued at 2 qian 7 li 5 hao. Yang Guifei opened at 2 qian 5 li. Cute Beauty opened at 2 qian 2 li. Shuangtong deer straight tribute flannel has been sold at 2 qian 5 fen 7 li 5 hao and above. All the above prices are 2 li 5 hao less than before. Yuehua flannel, which was firm for a while, is also showing weakness. Both actual sales and local customers are quiet. Western goods are increasingly stagnant and are as rare as morning stars.</p>

<p>Tutu Sold for Twenty-Eight Taels</p>
<p>New honey dates from Jiaxing arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, totaling more than 30 buckets. As the new season is just beginning, they are quite popular and the quality is good. Sales began in the market yesterday, with the tutu price opening at around 28 taels. The upper-grade merchants still followed the usual practice of adding and subtracting commissions for wholesale. As more goods are expected to arrive, the market may ease. Old stocks have been reduced and most of the sugar quality has melted and the color is also poor, so the selling price is more than ten taels different from the new goods.</p>

<p>New foreign dollars have been selling very well recently in the Yangtze River region, and the demand from inland Fujian merchants is also wide, so the number sold in the market in recent days has been considerable. It is heard that merchants from Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, and other cities have been purchasing a large number of 3-cent and 5-cent denominations in recent days. Therefore, the selling side is expected to continue to raise prices.</p>

<p>Construction merchants Feng Taixing, Xin Renji, Gongxin Factory, and other firms sold more than 160 tons of 3-cent to 1-inch deformed steel in the market yesterday. The market supply has been almost entirely purchased and the standard has a high chance of continuing to rise. The current price is 115 taels.

<h3 id="e296">The Music of Black People <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Changxi</p>
<p>Black people’s contribution in music has had a wider impact than their poetry and novels, giving the world a stronger force. Not only did they give American music its Negro blood, which forms the foundation of modern American Jazz, but they also infused countries outside of America with the Negro blood of music. The Negro blood carries a crude intoxication, leading mankind towards savagery. This intense atmosphere has already conquered the people of Europe and America.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we discuss modern American music, or even American civilization, we cannot abandon the contributions of Black people. Furthermore, we cannot forget that Jazz, which constitutes modern American civilization, is a special symbol of the Black people’s conquest of American music and even culture. Although Jazz is just a word in the African-American language containing mixed meanings, since 1919 when Black slaves were brought to America on Dutch ships, the strong vitality of the Black people flowing within Jazz has never changed. Although there have been slight changes in form, it fundamentally cannot break free from the blood of the Black people. In the essence of Jazz, one-third is the blood of the Black people, one-third is the common American ideals and emotions of the middle class, and one-third is the spirit of the "Machine Age." Therefore, Jazz, from Africa to America, has completely conquered it. This Jazz, which has conquered over one hundred million Americans, has become America's national art, giving America its soul and national music through Jazz. Although many people believe that Jazz, which is constituted by the blood of the Black people, cannot become art and cannot last forever, Paul Whitman, who is considered the King of Jazz, believes that as long as it can appeal to the masses and touch the depths of life, it will not easily disappear in this era that is warmly welcoming it. Moreover, it did not come from Europe, nor did it originate from the palace of intellectual art, but it is a product born from the emotions of the masses. Naturally, it can surpass the evaluation of whether it is art and last forever. Therefore, while listening to Jazz, because of the natural rhythm and the fusion of emotions, people forget the constraints of the world in dance, making a powerful protest against American mechanical civilization.</p>
<p>In addition to Jazz, which is constituted by the blood of Black people, Black music became famous in America starting in 1871. Since the Black students' choir performed once, they were recognized by Americans. From this, because they had the opportunity to enjoy education, they slowly commanded out their original musical talent of the Black people.</p>
<p>The first musician who could inject the blood of the Black people into music and also boasted of it was Saint George (Chevalier Sain George 1755-1799). He was a student of Gossec, wrote two scores for violin and choir, and was also very famous in France. Similarly, August Bridgetower, who was friends with Beethoven, also praised the blood of the Black people in his songs. These two, along with Edmued Dede and Joweph White and Samuel Coleridge Taylor, were all musicians famous in Europe. However, some Black musicians in America served as singers in churches, while others served in a choir, and they could not fully represent the entire music of the Black people. Naturally, there was no talk of infusing their national blood into it. Therefore, in the past eight or ten years, the Black composers only had solo songs, violin solos, and mixed choral pieces and flute pieces, while the achievements of the singers were limited to a kind of church or affiliated group. As for musicians, only Haiy T. Buileigh had performed before the King and Queen of England and the Prince of Prussia and the Duke of Sweden, obtaining international fame, while the others did not have any great musicians.</p>
<p>However, the Black composers are advancing year by year, not only wanting to release a unique brilliance in American literature, but also, like novelists or poets, expressing the Black people's life and the awakening of national consciousness in their works, infusing their blood into the musical scores, so that its special qualities can forever conquer the national music of Americans. Furthermore, the Black composers in the industrial areas of northern America believe that the Black people's life in the South can be used as the basis for new melodies, and have already united with the composers and poets of the South to strive to express the Black people's life in the agricultural areas of the South. The purpose is to awaken the national consciousness in the music of all Black people in America, so that this moving power that surpasses novels can be accompanied by the increasingly prominent national consciousness in Black people's poems. In this way, Black people have entered a new dawn period in music and poetry. Let us look forward to the unfolding of new glories.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Recent Turkish Literary Circles (Continued) <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Turkish Wandering Poets</p>
<p>The poets of the Bektash sect have recently become figures in the Turkish literary scene. This is because Sadettin Nonzhel recently collected the famous works of these poets and printed them in a large book. The Bektash sect is a branch of Islam, but it is opposed to the orthodox Islamic sect, and they regard each other as enemies. Therefore, the followers of this sect created many poems and stories, striving to satirize and ridicule the orthodox religion they opposed. Because they were under the oppression of the orthodox religion, these works were secretly circulated. The founder of this sect was Hadji Bektash. It is said that he performed many miracles, and stories of these miracles have circulated among the people. There have been German translations and Old Turkish pamphlets. These stories or poems all carry a Persian flavor and Zorastrianism aura.</p>
<p>Fat Be</p>
<p>(EuadBeg), a Turkish folklorist, is collecting Turkish folk literature. Turkey has rich folk literature, but in the past, the Turks did not pay much attention to it. Only the Germans studied it in great detail. Recently, the University of Istanbul in Turkey has focused on this aspect and has a special group of people to do this work. The person in charge is Fat Be. In addition, Gross translated some Bektash stories. Gizeh and Mintzel are collecting fairy tales. Battai Gazi was a great hero in Turkish legend who defended the border of Baghdad in ancient times and prevented the invasion of the Pishanting people. There are many poems praising him in the old Turkish literature. These poems have a very strong national consciousness and fully express the national spirit. It is a pity that none of these poems have been translated into new Turkish by a new poet.</p>
<p>Children's Books</p>
<p>Has always been neglected in Turkey, so there are very few books of this kind. Because of this, the Turkish "Director of Physical Education" has also become a writer and published a small book. He calls this book "Supplementary Reading". It is full of simple and clear texts about his experiences while traveling in Europe, which is indeed a book suitable for children to read.</p>
<p>New Books This Year</p>
<p>Among them, two books are worth noting. One is "Songs and Dances of Eastern Anatolia" (SongsandDancesorEasternAnatolia) with one hundred and sixteen pages. Edited by Mahmaud Ragip and published by the Istanbul Conservatory of Music, it details the results of the Eastern Anatolian expeditions and can be regarded as a major contribution of New Turkey to the art of the Near East. Another new book is "Biography of Gazi Mustapha Kemal" by Burhan Chbit and published by Kanaat Bookstore. This is a biography of the leader of the Turkish Republic and also a history of the Turkish Republican government. It is written with great interest and the illustrations are very exquisite.</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e298">A Letter from Bernard Shaw <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Lan</p>
<p>Refusing to Attend a Friend's Wedding</p>
<p>A letter written by Bernard Shaw refusing to attend the wedding of a friend has recently been revealed in Charles Grave's work "—and those Greeks". This letter was written to Grave and could have been published earlier, but it was delayed until today because of the bride's objection.</p>
<p>The wording of this letter is truly worthy of careful consideration. The original text is translated and published as follows:</p>
<p>"My dear Charles—my attending your wedding or anyone's wedding is really out of the question. In the past week, I have resolutely declined to participate in the same ceremony. If I make an exception for your affairs, I will never be able to see my good friends again.</p>
<p>Besides, I don't have formal attire.</p>
<p>I estimate that having my tailor make a suitable suit will cost me fifteen guineas (approximately 270 yuan in Chinese currency) and will be of no use to me in the future because I never wear it formally during the day. But this may be of great use to you because you rely on going out into society to earn your living. So, it is obvious that I must send you some wedding gifts. The solution to our problem is to send you this suit, thereby blessing your wedding. If I were an ordinary person,</p>
<p>I could give the attached check to your tailor and tell him to do his best to make you the best suit for this amount. If there is a gift book, see if he lists me in the book as "Barnett Shaw…a suit of clothes". If you want to display the gifts, the tailor shop should be able to lend you a mannequin.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on the passing of your youth and shake your hand with melancholy irresponsibility. I really feel sorry for Beg, but you can be sure that she is just as disappointed with anyone after a week.</p>
<p>As for you, it is too early to run away now. This is what you have been looking for, Charles.</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw"</p>
