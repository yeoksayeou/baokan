<h3 id="c8">德國會解散 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>德政府之决欲以最後手段解散國會。吾昨巳論之而果也今巳下令實施矣。</p>
<p>凡議會政治。無論何國。其議員對於解散國會。必存畏懼之心。苟可以避免解散者。無不力圖避免。白魯林内閣甫成立。社會民主黨。即提過一次不信任内閣案。政府與黨與反對黨兩派相持。形勢巳甚危險。幸其時有一部分議員軟化。斯案得被否决。而國會幸免於解散。乃不謂今日仍不能免此一劇者何也。蓋議會中之社會民主黨。旣具决心倒閣。以示報復。而其左翼各黨。又不慊於政府之右傾。與其態度之强硬。故亦愈激愈烈。卒具推翻决心。寗解散國會。而不悔也。</p>
<p>雖然。解散國會而重選。在此選舉之時。每易啓重大糾紛選舉結果。又未必能操勝算。故爲政府者。亦每不肯輕言解散。今德政府竟毅然解散而不懼者何也。蓋今日之德總統與總理。皆非懦弱無能爲之輩。平昔以建設强固有力之政府自命。自信旣深。决不肯輕易其主張。而今日之財政新方案。又認爲政府之存亡關頭。故毅然解散而不恤耳。現今世界各强國。財政上遭遇此同樣之困境甚多。若法雖未下令解散國會。而已下令休會若英則反對政府之各黨。亦正日日進行倒閣運動政府雖尚虚與委蛇。最後恐亦難免此一手段。而德其首先實施者歟。</p>

<p>蘇省水産之富不亞於其他沿海各省、早有開發之必要、農礦廳爲增加蘇省生産起見、對於該項行政、雖因省庫支絀、多感困難、然仍極積規劃、從事進行、兹擇其重要者、分述如下、</p>
<p>（甲）調查事項（一）調查江南沿海漁業、蘇省江南沿海各縣、如南匯川沙奉賢金山松江等縣之漁業現况、調查結果、統計各縣大小漁船共有一百二十餘艘、漁民約二千餘人、中以南匯縣爲最佔多數、有漁船六十餘隻、漁民八百餘人、其次爲松江縣、而漁業共有五類、（一）川洋網漁業、此網形似流網、爲固定漁具之一、漁期每年自榖雨日起、至七月上旬止、漁場在大戢山之西北、銅沙之東北、盛漁期間、每船可獲魚四十餘擔、少則四五擔不等、一漁期之漁值在二千元至六千元間、魚類多爲馬鮫魚鰣魚　　黄魚鰳魚之類、（二）張網漁業、此種漁業之漁船、以松江川沙兩縣爲最多、漁場在大戢山東北、雞骨礁西南、航路之北側、漁期每年分二汛、四月至六月爲第一汛、七月至十二月爲第二汛、漁獲物爲鰻　黄魚鰳鯧馬鮫魚鱭魚黄華魚秋刀魚之屬、惟第二汛多爲張取海蟄鱭魚蝦之屬、每年一船之漁值、約自五百元至二千元、（三）猛網漁業、是項漁業之漁法、與張網同、專捕鱭魚白蝦之類、漁場在大戢山西北、或奉賢城南四十里外、漁期爲三至六及九至十二等六個月、每年一船之漁值、約自八百元至一千四百元、（四）拉釣漁業、此種漁業、分船釣與徒步釣兩種、徒步釣因漁獲不多、將自行消滅、船釣漁場在大戢山東北及北頂星山之西北、漁期每年自三月起、漁獲物分爲鱸鮸赤鱏及鞋底魚等、每年一船之漁值在一二千元間、（五）揷網漁業、此項漁業爲資本最輕之一種、槪爲沿海居民之副業、南匯奉賢松江金山等縣均有之、漁獲不多、每年漁值約在百元左右、上列各漁業之漁船除有四艘爲獨資經營外、其餘多屬合股性質、船員之被僱者、每汛約得二資百元、但每人准帶網一頂、可得漁值二三十元、因此之故、船東多向船員收抽漁值百分之五至百分之十五爲乘船費、惟老大則免收、每屆漁期、各縣沿海漁民駕小舟乘風破浪遠赴漁場、又不帶冰鹽船上設備簡陋、甚至睡臥烹炊之所亦無準備、一遇氣候惡劣、暴風壓境之時、則歸港甚難、能避風之島灣、多海盜出沒、不敢前往、若遇連日暴風、則魚類因無冰鹽而腐臭、終致抛棄海中、數日之辛勤、化爲烏有、不特此也、又以漁場網具之裝置、多爲外輪所衝破、或被浙屬流網船因碍其漁撈、而砍斷繩索、使之漂失、保全人舟、已屬萬幸、更不知向何處理論、凡此種種、該廳現均在籌劃改良及保護中、（二）調查魚苗事業、魚苗之産量、年來逐漸減少、巳成爲養魚業之絕大問題、農廳於上月十日曾派技佐李兆輝會同水産學校養殖試騐場技術員劉桐身、先在鎭江附近練壁高資鮎魚套等地、考查魚苗事業之情形、且對於魚苗之産地採集法運搬法飼養法、以及販賣情形等、均特别加以注意、</p>
<p>（乙）指導事項該廳於五月二日派技正侯朝海宣傳員黄可莊前往吳淞滸浦一帶、召集漁民、映放漁業電影、以資宣傳、並於滸浦映放漁業影片之際、召集滸浦漁業領袖談話、由技正侯朝海主席、報告中國漁業之衰落、技術之不精、物質上設備之不完全、因而日本每年在中國領海内所捕獲者、即黄花魚一項、價值亦在五千萬元以上、并宣布該廳現在將江蘇的産魚場所劃分爲五個漁業區及漁業根據地、預備在各區中心地設立漁業指導所、指導漁業的改良漁船的構造、及合作社之組織、以及討論滸浦港淤塞之開浚、曁滸浦漁業之補救、滸浦港燈塔之設置等、</p>
<p>（丙）開浚事項該廳於滸浦召集漁業領袖談話後、據技正侯朝海實地測勘、滸浦港報告、該港口中央水最深處、亦僅五尺、漁船商船出入均感不便、且滸浦爲漁業繁盛之區、若不設法浚深、殊有碍於將來漁業之發展、特咨請建設廳、轉飭常熟縣政府建設局、從速勘明開浚、所需經費、將在水利項下支撥、</p>
<p>（丁）取締事項該廳以墨魚（即烏賊魚）籠捕魚殊有碍於水産物之繁殖、特佈告取締、並分别函令水上公安隊第四區區本部、及沿海各縣政府、隨時查禁、</p>

<p>漢口通信、湖北省政府以特稅附加、爲本省清鄕勦匪之基本經費、關係治安前途、至爲得要、前由兩湖特稅處代爲徵收、因在某處長任内、弊端叢生、正稅銳减、附加亦因之影響甚鉅、特經政務會議議决、自行設局徵收、以專責成、並委任桂競秋爲局長、業巳開始辦公、積極進行、惟特稅處方面藉詞有碍正稅收入、呈請總司令部及財政部轉令撤銷、財部長宋子文巳據情電商省府、擬由特稅收入每月撥銀二十萬元補助、徵求同意、昨省府巳電覆財部、大意謂（一）此次舉辦特稅附加、實以地方財政瀕於絕境、補苴無方、而各屬匪共猖獗、後防堪慮、勦匪清鄕刻不容緩、而經費絲毫無着、不得不另關稅源、力謀自救、（二）保安團各聯防區總保衛團及警備旅實行清鄕勦匪、並補助駐鄂國軍勦匪綁費、所以保衛地方、鞏固後防、此等經費皆在預算之外、尤非另關稅源、不足以資挹注、（三）十五年以前特稅、由鄂省主辦、因緝私得力、每月收入二三百萬元、現稅率倍增、而稅收未見起色、實由緝私者未負專責、私販任其充斥、若省府協助緝私、正式商人咸願樂從、正稅收入自益暢旺、（四）省府與特稅處利害相關、果特稅處允予互助、協力進行、則私販勢必絕跡、兩相監督、弊端剔除、正稅附稅亦必俱暢、誠兩利而不相妨、（五）中央與鄂省休戚相關、如由正稅内撥助二十萬、則係分之於中央、若徵收附加、則取之於吸戸、最後並聲明、此舉果有損於中央、縱令有利於地方不、决不願爲、亦不敢爲、經審度再三、實係兩受其利、深望顧念地方安危、後防重要、屏棄浮言、俾得照案進行云、（七月十八日）</p>

<p>廣州通信、西北兩江商運通暢與否、直接影響於全省商務甚大、近該兩江商務、因種種關係、情况不一、兹將近狀調查如下、</p>
<p>北江　北江一路、遠通湘贛、又有粤路運輸之利便、故商務極大、上月間因張桂軍竄入湘境、第八路討逆軍取道北江入湘堵截、粤路忙於運載軍隊北上、及輸送軍實、以致貨車之開行、未能依照常例、直至本月七日始行照常來往、當此時期、省方僣北江商務、不無影響、北江各項土産品、因無車不能運省、所有韶關馬壩烏石英德源潭各地、均貨積如山、由省北上之貨、亦無從運往、同時由北江至湘之一路、運輸上亦稍窒碍、時幾陷於半停頓狀態、幸湘省軍事未幾即告結束、商運隨即復通、其他交通旋亦完全恢復常態、近由北江運省之貨、頗覺擠擁、因在早造收穫時期、新榖最佔六宗、柴炭運到亦夥、其餘則爲紙張牲口及各項土産品、由省運往之貨、則棉紗布疋海味日用雜貨等、據運商言、本年北江早造禾稻、頗爲豐收、農民生計、在困苦中比較的充裕、料其消費力量、或比前稍勝、在最近之將來、北江商務或有起色</p>
<p>西江　西江商務之榮枯、與桂省局面具有極密切之關係、蓋貨物之吞吐大部份以廣西爲尾閭也、上月張桂軍捨桂逃湘、桂中軍事隨告結束、斯時西江商務雖未可稱之爲恢復原狀、然大體上已漸有來甦之象矣、觀於近月運往梧州之貨增加、即其一證、即上游之南寗柳州各地、亦有貨物與梧來往、復由梧州轉運下粤、詎料張桂軍近復竄回桂省、以一部踞桂林、同時柳州南寗等地、又陷入張桂軍肘腋之下、於是與下游之來往商運、又復大受影響、據西江運商云、桂林柳州兩地、現巳無貨往來、邕梧間之貨運、亦經停頓、前數日南寗方面、雖曾有電船三艘載貨開到梧州、但此數船似係含有避難性質、因南寗形勢不佳、故將存貨掃數趕運西下發賣、過此則恐無貨運來、至由下游運往之貨、則自日昨得接邕商停止辦貨之電報後、多巳停止付往、至於由廣州運赴西江之貨、除在粤境内各埠、如常付往外、運赴梧州者、經巳減少、查連日運往之貨、多爲棉紗布疋等項、但據一部份商人之推測、則謂桂省内地、雖或因軍事影響、以致妨碍商務、惟粤省西江沿岸、本年農務尚佳、或足稍賢彌補、且此次軍事必較易結東、　商務可不致受重大牽動云、</p>

<p>大同樂會古樂動聽</p>
<p>梅蘭芳答詞甚謙虚</p>
<p>昨爲梅蘭芳由新大陸返國後之第二日、海上名流及各業領袖假大華飯店開會歡迎、賓主揮汗、把晤一堂、亦酷暑中韻事也、梅氏去國半載譽滿海外、昨日之迎梅茶話會、雖亦酬酢　交際之一種、然梅氏萬里長征、倦遊歸國、此則第一次與社會人士相見、勝會槪况、約略記之、以告讀者、</p>
<p>新大陸歸客會場設大華飯店意大利花園、佐以大同樂會古樂、客臨其地、頗有中西文化媾通之妙想到會者除昨報所誌四十四主人外、中西來賓、濟濟一堂、且有挈眷蒞會者、履舄交錯、鬢影衣香、梅氏之受人歡迎、可謂盡矣、客旣齊集、梅氏始入場、一一點首爲禮、玄褂白衫、態度安閒、手執紙摺扇、見客略與寒喧、諸人心目中之新大陸歸客、其談吐舉止、固一仍其舊也、</p>
<p>李石曾致詞　大同樂會鄭覲文君、率會員奏國民大樂五章、琴調琵和、鐘鳴鼓附、客咸擊節嘆賞、樂止掌聲如雷、而主席李石曾君即起立、昨日歡迎會主席、原係張市長、但張未能列席、李君發吻、首述此意、次言梅氏此行之成功、即係中國戲劇之成功、亦即中西文化媾通之實現、顧又有申說者、歌劇之要素、包括藝術敎育而言、原非等閒之謂、中國之戲劇、不求宣傳於外、亦自有其相當之價值、至於西劇亦然、正不必各趨極端、去短補長可也、最後謂梅氏此行返來、於中國舊劇、另予以新的生命、希望梅氏之能努力耳、其詞由謝福生君爲之譯成英語、虞洽卿君亦即席演說、對梅表示欽遲、</p>
<p>胡葉之演說　胡適博士繼虞君發言、大意梅蘭芳之成功、乃梅氏個人之成功至於中國戲劇問題、當另行討論、胡博士對於梅氏之成功更謂係其人格修養有以致之苟易他人、能否載此美譽而歸、正未可必、末謂梅蘭芳於返國之前、致函滬友、述其到處受人歡迎譽者愈多、心中愈覺慚愧、我有何能、膺此過奬、今後於戲劇之道、必當多加研究再下工夫云云、博士言即此一端可見梅氏虚懷若谷其成功非偶然也至於梅氏友人之互相帮助、亦非祗爲梅氏個人耳葉恭綽君爲演說中之最後一人、其言於胡適之君之「梅氏個人的成功」外、加以補充、略謂梅氏游美之成功、固不必言、其尤爲重要者、則梅氏介紹中國戲劇於外人之前、使知中國劇之眞相而免糢糊之揣想、梅氏啓行之前、同人等預料其成功可待今則果然耳、亦足見梅氏之藝術造就、自有過人之處、</p>
<p>歡迎席上李石曾梅蘭芳</p>
<p>梅蘭芳答詞　梅蘭芳於諸人鼓掌　　聲中、起立致答詞、操極純粹之國語、一語一頓、聽者清晰異常、其詞如次、蘭芳承諸先生的鼓勵北平戲劇學院之提倡、才能實現去美國的夢想這一次去、巳經有了半年了、蘭芳赴美的目的、原爲我個人的學問智識和技能、因爲向來太沒有根底、而且又缺少研究、所以很想出去看看别人家的東西、或者能夠得到一點益處、一到紐約之後、本想先就去研究研究不過各方面都希望我先能夠演戲、所以就决定開演兩個星期、結果演了五個星期、紐約對於我們中國戲的批評倒都是非常之好的報上都常常有關於我國戲的記載、他們都很贊揚我們中國文化的深博奥妙、因此别的地方、都來信來人、約我去表演、有幾處地方、因爲時間和布置上、種種不方便、所以只去了幾個大地方、由紐約就到了芝加哥、在芝加哥演了十天地又到舊金山、演了二星期、就到洛斯安極兒斯、洛斯安極兒斯是離好來塢很近的在洛斯安極兒斯演了十天、我們又到好奴魯魯去、那邊的華僑、對於祖國的興味、是非常的濃厚的、所以結果各處都很好、上面所演的一段的事實、由此可以證明我這次去、實在是因爲演戲的事情太忙、對於研究方面、說不出什磨來、倘是要有人來問我關於美國戲劇上的事情、我恐怕還得請敎别人、至於我演戲所得到一點聲譽的結果、那是更不足道了、因爲我表演的、祗是一門、而且我自已總覺得還夠不上藝術的意味、現在我回想起來、在蘭芳出走之前、蒙諸位先生極力的贊助、到了美國之後、美國的人對於我給我很好的批評、還有許多僑胞、也都非常的熱心、據蘭芳看起來、這一次並不光是個人一點小小的榮幸、就是中國戲劇上的一點成功、也還是事小、其中或者還有關係比較大一點的呢、蘭芳出去的時候、心上時常很惶恐的、今天回來、蒙諸位先生開這樣盛大的聚會、我心上更覺得慚愧、蘭芳這次回來之後、更覺得自巳智識淺薄、不過我决不敢辜負諸位先生的盛意和期許、從此以後、預備多多的用用功去研究研究戲劇、要是有機會呢想再出去看看别人家的進步、所以我很有這個决心、作爲報答諸位先生及在美僑胞美國各界對我一番的厚意、</p>

<p>庖丁頓起不良心</p>
<p>夜半持菜刀入室</p>
<p>砍傷甚劇竟不治</p>
<p>英人却爾司、年五十三歲、現在海關服務、與其妻同寓北四川路八五九號洋房之三樓、一星期前、其妻别之回國、却氏乃獨居焉、惟却頗富有、喜裝飾、平素　　服御豪華　指上鑽戒、腕間金表、皚皚之光、燦爛之色、見者羨之、囊内復無空時、常有鈔幣纍纍、隠約現於衣外、致啓匪人非分之心、却之庖丁粤人薛成、於半月之前、雇有助手名潘執者、亦隸粤籍、潘覩主人渾身皆珍物、垂涎之餘、</p>
<p>竟懷惡意　早欲謀奪、無機可乘、近知主夜係獨宿、以爲遇此間隙、不宜坐失、乃於昨日午前一時、潛赴廚下、取得鋒利無四之菜刀一柄、持之登樓、破扉而入却室、却自夢中驚覺朦朧睡眼、瞥此　　雪亮鋼刀　大聲呼救、而潘已迎面劈來、却徒手抵抗、致肩臂連被砍兩刀、潘亦心慌、棄刀飛奔下樓避匿、却則</p>
<p>臨窗呼號、斯時虹口捕房探員馮琪·張玉亭·俱聞警赶至、因該屋大門緊閉、不暇待其開啓、即自門側窗口躍入、先往樓上見却</p>
<p>倒臥血泊　中、詢明原委、立以電話報告捕房、一面就屋内搜毁兇手、蓋該探等以各門均閉、逆料兇手或匿於屋内也、嗣果尋至廚房附近之厠所、見潘</p>

<p>幽風之詩曰。七月食瓜。八月斷壺。周七八月。當夏五六月。天時酷暑。屏食腥羶。掘筍翦蔬。别饒雋味。鄕間夜話。每聚集於豆棚瓜架下。蟬聲相送。螢火欲流。絕妙一幅消夏圖也。</p>
<p>廣雅以龍蹄獸掌羊駁兔頭桂髓蜜筩小青大班爲瓜名。然瓜有二種。入饌者如冬瓜絲瓜之屬。大者曰瓜。小者曰瓞。若瓠瓤。若　　。皆其類也。宋孝武帝詩曰。爬醬調秋菜。此爲醬瓜。陸游詩曰。晴擔曝瓜鮝。是爲鹹瓜。晨起佐饔。晚飮下酒。非風雅者不能領略。至西瓜等類。祗以解熱。恐不堪攙入食單耳。</p>
<p>壺盧瓜屬。長而有柄。壺亦作葫。其實瓠也。匏苦瓠甘。陶弘景嘗言之。正字通謂瓠一名　　。昔盧懷愼欵客。語庖人曰。爛蒸去毛。莫拗折項。聞者以爲蒸鴨矣。及揭覆皿。蒸壺而巳。然果削皮去　。劙成短段。漉鹽調鼓。清芬撲人。否或切作細絲。拌以筍乾。亦頗可口。而閩粤諸人。反垂甘瓠而食苦匏。殆所謂嗜好的俗殊酸鹹歟。</p>
<p>前漢食貨志云。菜茹有畦。瓜瓠果蓏。生涯老圃。時獲嘗新。滬上瓜壺。擔自村落者。什不三四。餘均由他處捆載而來。越宿再宿。精華盡去。而問價幾與魚肉彷彿。自慚寒畯。久齩菜根。安得返棹吳興。重尋紫寛黄茄之地哉。</p>

<p>翌晨十時。戈氏第一講。題爲「報紙之過去現在與未來」。余先以報紙史料。懸諸壁間。如嘉慶年間外人所辦之第一華文報紙。中國最早之單面及雙面印</p>
<h3 id="c171">龜鳴誌異嵇覲 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>湖屬烏鎭下鄕汪姓家畜一龜。年近百齡。並無他異。上月某日。主人附輪赴滬。方出門時。龜忽昻首而鳴。啁啁啾啾。聲與雛雞覓食相似。衆皆異之。聽者四集。約半小時始已。主人忽促登程。時巳不及。知係爲龜所誤。恚甚。急命家人投諸河中。載沈載浮。杳然不知其所止。</p>
<p>當時議論紛紛。僉以爲凶多吉少。主人素號維新。不尚迷信。聽之而巳。習日得警報。悉該輪於昨夜行至蘆墟附近。忽遇盗匪。行李銀物。搶刦一空。且乘客中致受槍傷者多人。方悟前此龜之所以鳴者。正爲救己也。驚喜之下。乃即遣人馳往原處。設法撈取。然石沉大海。未卜其能物歸故主否。此事同里徐君言之鑿鑿。特誌之。</p>
<p>刷物。光緒維新前後各種主要報紙。率皆百年來不易經見之物。有爲戈氏在倫敦博物館所攝得者。聽衆五十餘。係報界同業。咸覺興趣盎然。三日上午第二講。「最近世界報業之槪觀」。事先陳列各國畫報。有單色耆。有三色者。悉係最新影寫版精印。琳瑯滿目。餘爲路透。聯合。電通各社通信網之地圖。講至各國報業及通信社之發達。與我國宣傳事業之落後。聽者皆爲動容。四日晚第三講。「中國報界應有之覺悟」。並放映幻燈。指示各國報館内外情形。蒞會者百餘。夜半始散。三次講完後。杭城報界深感自身工作之困難。與生活之不易。紛向戈氏示以解决之法。於斯可見同業進取之心之深且切矣。</p>
<p>杭州報紙凡六家。民國日報。國民新聞。之江日報。浙民日報。民聲報。浙江商報是也。余等曾經一度之視察。就中以民國規模較大。餘均因陋就簡。印刷且委諸人。日出兩張。亦有三張者。編制尚好。新聞方面。千篇一律。專稿可寓目者尚少。據報界歷史較久之某君言。各報廣告收入不豐。銷數多者三千餘。經濟方面均感拮据。記者待遇甚薄。故潔身自好者不可多　。印務工友尤難應付。其實上述諸點。不特内地報界之通病。都會報亦類此。甚望勞資兩方。各量其力。各盡其能。逐漸改良。共促進步。</p>
<p>到杭之後。友朋酬酢。幾無虚日。某次席間曾談及杭城禁烟。禁賭。禁娼、及浙境匪况等事。聞父老言。自嚴禁烟賭以後。巳著有成績。社會罪惡事端。無形減少。是誠省府政績之一端。惟是萬惡社會之積弊。欲一掃而空。行亦不易。以杭而論。烟賭諸項。表面上似巳禁絕。實際則猶未也。譬如公娼歇而私娼起。當局禁娼。以抽籤法行之。其巳脫離人肉市塲之難女。暫納於收容所。初入者未嘗以爲苦。旣而因生活之艱難。及婚嫁之無望。都不願久留。亦有出而復爲私娼者。此乃當局未能爲謀澈底解决之道耳。鴉片則在旅社公寓等處、仍可一榻横陳。自由吸食。由於警察之不力。近且紅丸盛行。黑籍中人。以此過瘾。按紅丸屬日貨。其毒甚於鴉片。嗜此者不二年可以致命。浙境各屬。匪亂頻聞。報紙尚少紀載。當局襲掩耳盜鈴之故智。殊非得計。又聞方自漢臯歸杭之某君言。武漢二埠。鴉片居然公賣。娼妓賭博。任人玩弄。兩湖特稅處。只管一筆大宗收入。不問其他。可慨也。</p>

<p>（十）東京之報業</p>
<p>東京爲日本政治之中心。自大正十二年大地震以來。政府與民衆一致努力於從事復興事業。迄於今日。己告大成。一切建築及街市之計劃悉按最新式理想之都市而進行。其繁盛規模足與世界最大都會紐約倫敦巴黎柏林等相比擬。記者十六日由大阪抵東京後。日夜籌備大會新聞採訪事宜。間以餘暇。略事遊覽。對於日人種種之設施。及其事業之猛進。惟有連聲讚美。不能重置一詞。在東京所得之影象。無一事不足紀。但頭緒紛繁。究不知從何說起。記者在報言報。姑先述東京之報業日本之新聞事業。現正在黄金時代。全國報紙除朝鮮二十七家。及台灣四家外。共有五百十三家。前篇所載大販朝日與每日新聞發達之狀况。非爲一地之特殊情形。乃普遍發展之結晶也。日人敎育普及。即人力車夫亦手持報紙。沿途誦讀。且民衆鑒别力極精。稍有色彩之報紙。即被擯棄。故如朝日與每日等均純粹中立。實行民衆喉舌之責任。有色彩之報紙大抵爲民政政友等政黨所主辦。至若公然受政府之津貼。則絕無僅有。各地方報紙繁盛之區多則十餘家。少亦二三家。營業所入。均足自給。但亦規模較大盈餘較厚者。如福岡日日新聞。資本一百萬元。日銷數十萬份。年獲利數十萬元。神戸新聞資本四十萬元。銷數利益亦在十萬以上。足以稱雄一隅。日本之報紙均兼營夕刊。故各項消息不虚隔膜。臨時倘復有重要新聞。則發號外。售價一二銅元。夕刊亦售銅元二枚。售報童子沿途販賣。頃刻而盡東京有日報二十二家。通信社四十二家。報紙資本在三十萬元以上。銷數十萬份以上者爲東京朝日新聞東京日日新聞。東京每日新聞。報知新聞。讀賣新聞。中外商業新報。時事新報。都新聞。國民新聞。萬朝報。東京每</p>
<p>夕新聞。東京大勢新聞。英文日本時報。通信社方而規模較大者有日本電報通信社。資本一百萬元。日本通信社五十萬圓。日刊中央通信社資本五十萬元。保險日日通信社資本十萬元。東京通信社資本十萬元。豐國通信社資本二十萬元。晝夜通信社資本十萬元。新聞聯合通信社。内外通信社資本五十萬元。帝國通信社資本五十萬元。</p>
<p>吕性伉直。有俠氣。少以寒微。常依族人同居。一日自塾中歸。途經茶肆。見有相士招之入座。語之曰。君儀表非凡。虎頷燕領。確是衛霍一流人物。惟華蓋太低。殊少福澤耳。吕笑曰。家貧如洗。得免凍餒幸矣。安敢有所希冀哉。不顧而去。會座中茶客某。家有祖田百項。爲豪强所奪。訟久不得直。因聆相士之言斥資助吕。勸往省垣陸軍講武堂肄業。且約曰。君異日貴後。乞爲此事助一臂之力。此外非所敢望也。吕勉諾之。不數年。以上考畢業。派充某營連長。出入軍闥。稍有權勢。遂即牘請縣。令。追田歸客。客爲之感謝不置吕自洊升師長以後。馭下尤嚴。一不當意。動輙謾駡。其部屬無敢稍忤之者。一日。與某參議作象棋戲。局方半。忽起入内。參議坐而久待。餓甚。然又不敢遽去。衛弁入白曰。某參議尚在。宜予午餐。吕叱曰。喫甚午飯。喫我當頭砲足矣。蓋忿其棋局之敗北也。其可　事類如此。或謂吕之爲人。慘刻寡恩。適足以取殺身之禍耳。</p>
<p>特别啓事　昨得本報杭州分館吳坤一君來電。謂有文友唐君梅溪。前晚在西湖飯店開某號房間。以安神藥水自殺。及翌晨發覺。急送杭州醫院救治。生命可保無虞。請爲通知其親屬云云。聞耗之下。震駭萬狀。顧因未悉唐君親屬所在。用特登報奉達。望即前往杭州醫院省視爲荷。瘦鵑敬啓。</p>

<p>滬南　見到貨船三數號、走銷甚淡、蘇同粳米價格續見欠佳、普通貨祗在二十元關口、比較前日須勒短五分右左、羊尖市胃軟弱、且洋米節節見短昨如見小兩角之譜、故本街進意極形呆滯、通變積存寥寥、到亦無幾、行情平定、大盤仍在十八元半上下、</p>

<p>詳究各民族、探討它們歷史上盛衰的情形、自然可以給我們中華民族一個絕大的覺悟、作者告訴我們、統計衰亡民族性的共同點有六、即（一）感情微温、（二）意志薄弱、（三）個性强而醉性弱、（四）懷疑、（五）摹倣、（六）無秩序、今日希臘、印度、埃及民族性的殘忍行爲冷酷手叚、意志薄弱、無責任、不澈底、印度宗敎部落團體的分裂、希臘人被呼爲「狐」的懷疑性、都所以成爲民族性衰亡的象徴、回過頭來看我們自已今日的中華民族性、是怎樣的一個狀態不可埋滅的事實告訴我們、恐怕還可加上、「懶」和「自私心」的兩個缺陷吧而且大多數的民衆根本就不曉得爲民族奮鬥的光榮、也不曉得有民族的意識、環顧新興民族如英、德·法·美諸國「一旦當國家有事之際、保守黨可與進步黨合作、工黨可與資本家團體提携」、我們看了應作如何底感想啊、</p>
<p>中國學者研究民族性的、確是很少、至於研究民族性的作品、更是寥若晨星、在久沉頽廢的中華民族中、一般學者大槪也受環境的陶醉、而忘却了所謂民族了吧、「各國民族性」一書、固然沒有把中華民族病的狀態、解剖了一下、不過在我們久忘民族意識的中華民族中、至少能下個激動、以各國民族性盛衰的事實來　較、我們看看我們的中華民族近今所走的路、究竟是向那一方面走着、處處蹈着墮落民族性的覆轍、我們是甘心墮落嗎、還應抖擻起精神、奮求自决、</p>
<p>「各國民族性」底内容、共分四篇、除首尾兩篇是緒論和結論外、第二篇講的是興盛的民族性、有二十六章之多、詳剖德·英·美·法·俄·意·日七國的民族性、第三篇是講的墮落的民族性、計五章、叙述埃及、猶太、希臘、印度、西班牙五國民族性所以墮落的原因、</p>
<p>如作者所說、「要瞭解各國民族性非常困難、第一、非縱覽各學者研究民族性之書不可、第二、非周遊各國深通各國社會的情形不可、第三、非詳究各國精神物質各方面内容不可、」在這許多的困難中、作者更能以科學的方法、把它整理得有系統地寫述出、我們自然應當認爲滿意的、作者研究一國民族性的特點以前、他都先把一國的天然環境介紹了一下、又把歷史的事實以及文化的環境和思潮的槪况、都分柝得有條不綦、固然不應承認環境有如何偉大底支配力、環境的變化、可以使種族也就隨之而變化、不過心性是隨敎化所左右的、環境亦有相當的力量、我們自然也不能絕對否認的、作者也是這種意思、他在緒論第四章就說、「本著所研究民族性的範圍、對於各國民族性、遺傳以外、並重環境、不但自然環境、並且社會環境、也包含在内、」</p>
<p>讀完本書、以歷史事實的證明、我們中華民族日日所走上的、都是死路一條、我們絕對沒有新興民族性的共同點、我們祗有衰亡的民族性的共同點、看、「只要一個地方有三個德國人、沒有不組織團體的、」可是我們中華的民族性是怎樣、一盤散沙樣的、「各人自掃門前雪、不管他人瓦上霜、」絕對沒有團體生活的習慣、與新興德國民族性相比、竟成了極端相反的寫實、其次、德國「當一九一八年十月的變亂、基爾車軍獨立、各地曫應、竟自叫威廉第二退位、當其革命初起時、外人的推測、都以爲德國必成蘇俄第二、但是不到一年、而國民會議召集、憲法告成、政局於此大定、··還是秋序井然、步驟不亂···不至步武蘇俄、這完全是民族愛秩序的表現、」而我們中國的民族性、又是怎樣、從民元迄今、竟不能創造出整個的憲法、更沒有愛民族愛序的表現、終歲内戰着、祗看到自暴自棄地增加了衰亡的象徵、</p>
<p>「我國人的性格、是說了不做、法國人的性格、是說了再做、德國人的性格、是做了再說、英國人的性格、是做了不說」、儘量發表言論、自然不能算作壞事、可是祇看到理論的文章、從不含得在事實上表現、於事何益、徒惹人的冷笑而巳這亦是衰亡民族性的缺陷、而新興的法·德·英諸民族性所沒有的、作者下這個斷語、自然是很刻切、（祇看看洋洋灑灑數萬言的紙面文章」以及「唱高調」等等的俗語、都是證明「說了不做」的事實、而英國的外交和新聞、都是以不動聲色見長）</p>
<p>「一個蕞爾三島、維新不過六十年、公然與世界列强爲伍、說到軍備、陸軍曾經打敗過俄國、海軍的成績、超過法意、國内工業、幾乎凡歐美所有的、日本都能倣造、這種奮鬥的精神、自然是值得注意的···從前古代歷史說、有人見斯巴達人的飮食、說惡食如彼不如死、所以斯巴達勇士輩出、假如看過日本人生活的、也就可以了然他們奮鬥的情形、」掉轉頭來看我國是怎樣的一個情形、偌大的民族、祇落得産業落後、在一個大都市中、差不多樣樣都要求之於舶來品、旣不肯奮鬥、還要窮奢極侈、這不是自掘墳墓嗎、</p>
<p>最奇怪的民族性、要算是俄國、處處取極端的方式、可是無恒的、因氣候和宗敎的關係、形成他們的懶惰性、但同時又能産生偉大的精神、而成爲偉大的民族</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>、　　民族所走的路、究是興盛還是　落、就值得人們的玩味了、我們看書上說　「俄國行極端專　的帝政、」步而變成共産政治、這種變化神速、彷彿昨天還只有洋車、今天巳發見飛艇、像這樣的極端變化、在歷史上除俄國外、幾乎再沒有第二個例、於是世人認識俄國是神秘的、俄國人是神秘的民族、其實把俄國民族性加一研究、纔知道這種極端變化、乃是俄國所固有的、絲毫不足爲奇、在俄國社會中、隨處可以看見···就是戰後蘇俄政治的變化、也可證明不少、譬如革命之初、厲行共産、打破資本制度、並且打倒帝國主義、但是到了一九二三年後、覺得此路不通、於是一變而恢復資本經濟、一面聯絡帝國主義者、旣巳恢復資本經濟了、但是又派人擾亂外國、不斷的宣傳共産、」　　再看俄國的偉大性、「俄國民族性也就自然偉大、這種偉在在精神、在哲學上文化上美術建築上固然可以看出、就在政治上也可以看出、譬如從前俄國在專制時、因常以爭覇世界爲目的、乃對日本宣戰時宣言、將開放日本爲世界公園、這是一例、」不過未免太空虚了、這亦即是俄國民族性缺點的所在、</p>
<p>這種奇奇怪怪、極端矛盾的俄國民族性、將來所走上的路是怎樣、將來新民族運動的前途怎樣、作者也不敢下個斷語、恐怕是未可樂觀吧、</p>
<p>作者在墮落的民族性一篇裏、開頭就這樣底告訴我們「墮落民族者、即古代曾有文明、一旦中落以後、一蹶不振、他國或以革命而强、或以維新而治、獨墮落的民族、不特不了解革命與維新、即偶有革命與維新、皆徒以助長紛亂」請看看我國的情形、是否是這樣、</p>
<h3 id="c194">中國的一個啞謎椿森 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>李青崖著</p>
<p>夏雨霏彌、陰霾四佈、客中無事、偶翻及新文藝雜誌第一卷第四號、其中最引我注目的一篇便是李青崖先生的「中國的一個啞謎、」</p>
<p>中國的啞謎是非常多的、但是在我們自己人的眼裏以爲這是平凡無奇的、不幸一到了異民族丨丨外洋人丨丨的眼裏、却滿滿乎有勞他們的驚奇而推測了、於是我們自己以爲不重要的、他們反勞精勞神給我們關心、甚至拿進他們表示是物質文明發達的所謂化學室去、或者宣傳起來、說中國奇奇怪怪的東西實在多不過、鴉片戰爭之前、中國還沒有同外洋人訂什麽通商條約、所以中國還畢竟是東方的文明大古國、像煞有介事地一股神聖不可侵犯的尊嚴、使一般外洋人敬而服之、這樣就發生「進貢」這會勾當了、其實的確「說到進貢、不過是當時自命爲天朝人物的片面糊塗議論罷、在事實上、我們至少應當看做這是那些黄頭髮綠眼睛的民族的一種探險行爲、」究竟在他們理想中的東方大古國的内部是些甚麽、問題是他們亟需要解决的、終於他們肯讓步、鞠躬變爲磕頭、成爲中華民族值得光榮的一會事、記得有一件可笑的事、中國蠶流入西洋、其中說來到足供一嘆、那是一位外國敎士因爲怕士人和出口地方人查出、反不高明、就偷偷摸摸把蠶子種放在鞋子裏、得以安全瞞過、現在却反而好蠶種須向外國去採辦了、這不是一件美談嗎、至於别的、那是多至不可計數的、總之、中國的秘密一直啞謎下去、儘在他們的心目中形成啞謎、是不妨事的、然而關於這啞謎的事、中國的文學家似乎是不暇顧到的、多麽可惜可憐、現在總算由李青崖先生發起了、比較的發揭了我們民族一些些少的光輝、也可說是使些顔色給外洋人看看、而且李青崖先生的翻譯我們是常見到的、創作很難、因之這篇更是可貴、</p>
<p>「中國的一個啞謎」是這樣的、在清朝乾隆年間有西洋一個甚麽咭唎咕　　到中國進貢、在某一次酬酢的宴會裏嘗着了「元宵」的滋味、那又白又圓又甜又酥的點心、以後每吃一次贊美一次、但是他們得着了一個奇異的疑問、就是「在北就所吃的這種點心、是用一種天然的鮮果整個風乾而成」而且「斷定這點心即令萬一不是天然的東西、然而除了孔夫子、决沒有第二個人能彀創造這樣的珍品、進一層、就是說祗有孔夫子知道其中的秘密、」後來他們又疑問了、「就是像那樣渾圓的内核、怎樣居然能彀緊緊地停匀地包在一個深圓的外彀裏面、而又絲毫不露一點兒痕跡呢、中國的玩意兒眞是層出不窮的啞謎、」最後從衙門的想盡方法、答應給一百兩紋銀做定製兩千枚元　的工料費、才有一家餑餑舖肯做元宵給他們看、到了那天約定的日期、他們便到那自認是找着孔夫子的信徒所開的店的作坊見個分曉、經掌櫃的向他們一一解說、他們也似懂非懂地點點頭、看着老司夫做、一面吩咐那幾個科學隨員和醫生要他們度量每一百個元宵所需的各種原料的成分、是怎樣配搭的、就是那一碗清水的重量也得仔細量一量、臨行之時、那位公使向那掌櫃問道、「你們都是孔夫子的們生嗎、」掌櫃答道、「我們不敢高攀、不敢、不敢、不敢、我們祇敬敬關夫子和財神爺、」於是這位外交官雖然明白了元宵之所以爲元宵、而那餑餑舖的掌櫃不敢高攀孔夫子而祇敬敬關夫和財神爺的這個啞謎却始終沒有法子解决、不知道在現在的咭唎咕嚕國的外交官的心裏、</p>
<p>得了解决沒有、</p>
<p>作者描寫作坊裏的細膩盡緻、我眞像身歷其境、那些外交官的一舉一動也非常神氣活現、把中國所有的啞謎都揭示出來、希望李先生繼續努力、使我們讀到這樣有味的作品、也希望中國文壇上多多發現這種作品、</p>
<p>拉雜寫了這些感想、這時巨暴的風吹濃葉聲、逼逼激來、聯想到通商之前和通商之後中華民族所受的影響、眞不勝今昔之感呵、</p>

He has sent Zhao Zhiqing to Beiping to handle the expansion of the association, and he trusts that it will be taken into consideration.

<h3 id="e8">Dissolution of the German Parliament <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The German government is determined to dissolve the parliament as a last resort. I discussed it yesterday, and it has indeed come to pass. Now the order has been issued and implemented.</p>
<p>For parliamentary politics, regardless of the country, the parliamentarians must have a fear of the dissolution of parliament. If it can be avoided, they will do everything possible to avoid it. The Brüning cabinet had just been formed when the Social Democratic Party introduced a motion of no confidence in the cabinet. The government and the party and the opposition were at odds, and the situation was very dangerous. Fortunately, at that time, some parliamentarians softened, and the motion was defeated, and the parliament was spared dissolution. But who would have thought that today it still could not avoid this drama? It is because the Social Democratic Party in the parliament has made up its mind to overthrow the cabinet to show revenge, and the left-wing parties are not satisfied with the government's right-leaning and its tough attitude. Therefore, they became more and more激昂(passionate) and resolute, and finally made up their minds to overthrow the cabinet,寧(would) dissolve the parliament rather than悔(regret).</p>
<p>However, dissolving the parliament and holding new elections during this election is likely to cause major disputes. The election results may not be certain to win. Therefore, the government does not easily talk about dissolution. Why is the German government so resolute in dissolving the parliament without fear? It is because the current German president and prime minister are not懦弱無能(weak and incompetent) people. They have always been proud of building a strong and powerful government. They are deeply confident and will never easily change their views. And today's new financial plan is considered to be a matter of life and death for the government, so they are resolute in dissolving the parliament without scruples. Currently, many of the world's major powers are encountering similar financial difficulties. Although France has not ordered the dissolution of parliament, it has ordered a recess. In Britain, the parties opposing the government are also conducting a motion of no confidence in the cabinet every day. Although the government is still虚與委蛇(insincere and evasive), it may be difficult to avoid this measure in the end. And Germany is the first to implement it?</p>

<h3 id="e10">Nanjing City Party Headquarters Circular Denounces the Enlarged Conference <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing City Party Headquarters issued a circular on the 19th, strongly denouncing the enlarged conference, stating in essence that, legally speaking, all party actions cannot deviate from the general charter. Since it is not found in the party's general charter, it is not a party organization. The members attending the meeting are either a few members of the first and second sessions who have been expelled from the party, or illegal members of the second session in Shanghai, and even bureaucrats and politicians who have no relationship with the party at all, such as Zhao Pilian, are also among those attending. They gather at will, with fifteen people signing on behalf of more than thirty people. The tasks of the first and second sessions have been completed and their validity has expired. Having been expelled from the party, they are not qualified to preside over the central cadres, and the Shanghai second session members illegally impersonate them, which is despised by all party comrades. Now, they gather a group of people with no legal basis and falsely claim an enlarged meeting. Who would dare to speak out against this deception? Factually speaking, the Western Hills faction originally criticized Wang and Chen for being 赤化(red), while the reorganized faction criticized Zou and Xie for being traitors. And Yan and Feng have never been compatible, which is also known to the Chinese people. People who have been at odds with each other in history now claim to be comrades and hold meetings. The purpose of combining temporary interests is only to produce a false party headquarters and a false government to carry out their plots to harm the country and殃民(plague the people). How is it different from Yuan's筹安会(Preparatory Society) and Duan's 善后会(Rehabilitation Conference)? They indulge in their personal desires and走入(enter) the path of counter-revolution, yet they still talk about party orthodoxy. How狂妄(arrogant) are they? It is hoped that comrades and compatriots will denounce and punish them. The party and the country will be fortunate. (19th) (Nanjing) The Nanjing City Party Headquarters will issue a circular denouncing the Beiping Enlarged Conference. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-French Vietnamese Trade Treaty was originally scheduled to be announced on the 10th. However, the French side raised questions about two points: the special rights that overseas Chinese in Vietnam should enjoy under the treaty and the interpretation of a certain annotation. Therefore, there were back-and-forth telegrams. Now that both parties have agreed, in addition to the original treaty, two attachments, and four exchanges of notes, one additional exchange of notes has been added. That is, the French envoy Fama's note to the Foreign Minister, requesting an explanation of the above questions, and the Foreign Minister's reply explaining the reasons why the status of our country's overseas Chinese in Vietnam is different from that of France and other countries, so they should enjoy special rights, and the interpretation of a certain annotation. It is scheduled to be announced simultaneously in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Paris, and Annam at 4 p.m. on the 24th.</p>

<p>Forced Dissolution of Parliament</p>
<p>General Election in September</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 18th - The Cabinet has issued a proclamation to the German people, stating that Parliament has rejected the necessary funds for the nation. The President's emergency decree has also been rejected by a majority of deputies. Because this majority of deputies differs only slightly from the minority and is not cohesive, it cannot take on the heavy responsibility for the government. Therefore, today we must ask the people of the whole country to decide their future. Will the German people withhold the funds necessary for the government to organize finances and maintain the prosperity of the economy? This is the question that you must answer on September 14th. The government hopes that the federation, various states, and cities will fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 18th - The political crisis in Germany has reached its peak today. After Parliament passed a vote of no confidence in the government proposed by the Social Democratic Party by 236 votes to 221, Prime Minister Brüning immediately announced the dissolution of Parliament. Thereupon, the cabinet retired and convened a cabinet meeting, ordering a general election to be held on September 14th and drafting a proclamation to the people. It will be released tonight. As for the order recently announced by the government regarding the new plan, because the motion of the Social Democratic Party is tantamount to a direct vote of impeachment, it is expected that the original order will be withdrawn tonight. After slightly revising the contents of the new tax law, a new order will be issued within the next week and implemented in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution. Although this new tax can be levied immediately at this time, it will be submitted for ratification as soon as the new Parliament is convened.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 18th - Today, before the German Parliament passed the motion of the Social Democratic Party, the debate between the two sides was fierce, and the commotion in the meeting place reached its extreme. The crowding of the audience was also unprecedented. The Parliament building was surrounded by spectators since early morning. After the meeting began, the leader of the Socialist Party, Landsberg, first defended the motion, accusing the government of violating the constitution. Thereupon, Minister of the Interior Wels and Minister of Finance Dietrich took the stand to refute him, each using extremely fierce language. Finally, the leader of the National Rights Party, Count Oldenbourg-Januschau, stood up and said that the party had decided to vote against the government. However, as soon as he finished speaking, the leader of the left wing of the same party, Count Westarp, immediately declared that he and 25 of his comrades opposed the party's decision and would vote in favor of the government. Therefore, in the minutes before the vote, it was not clear which side had the majority. After Parliament declared its dissolution, the police immediately expelled the audience in front of the parliament and went inside to arrest the Communist and National Socialist deputies who had voted to detain them, but they had all disappeared, apparently anticipating this move in advance and making secret preparations.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 18th - French newspapers have mostly expressed disappointment with the British response to Briand's plan for a European Federation. Le Journal stated that the response was as unenthusiastic as could be, indicating that Britain was both afraid of being drawn into the European vortex and wanted to retain its freedom of action in Europe, putting it in a dilemma. Therefore, it suggested listing the proposal on the agenda of the League of Nations General Assembly for discussion, hoping that it could be shelved in the future. Le Petit Parisien stated that the British response showed a lack of courage and ideals.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bombay, 18th - The German Export-Import Co., Ltd., established by German merchants, plans to engage in large-scale import and export trade between Germany and India. It has now begun operations in Bombay. The company is jointly operated with an Indian commercial organization called the Indo-German Goods Cooperation Company. The Indian company will be the sales manager for all of India, with the aim of shipping 400,000 pounds worth of German goods to India each year and importing 800,000 pounds worth of Indian raw materials to Germany. It is said that the Indian company has Indian financiers backing it. It is now planning to build factories throughout India to manufacture the necessary daily necessities from various countries for the Indian people. The company organized by German merchants is composed of more than 200 German factories, led by Mr. Fickert, who traveled to India, examined the Indian market, and decided to cooperate with Indian merchants to help them develop Indian industry.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 18th - Another 14 cotton mills, due to stockpiles and sluggish trading, will be closed from August 1, affecting 40,000 workers. According to yesterday's news, the 10 mills of the Sassoon Group have expressed their intention to suspend operations from August 15 if business does not improve, affecting 20,000 workers.</p>
<h3 id="e69">U.S. President Has the Power to Adjust New Tariffs <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Other Countries Can Request Revisions If Dissatisfied</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 19th - The recently announced and implemented tariff bill in the United States gives the President the special power to increase or decrease some of the tariff rates. However, before increasing or decreasing, the President can only exercise this special power if the Tariff Commission first determines that an increase is necessary. This provision has been vehemently attacked by opposition deputies. Dr. Klein, Undersecretary of Commerce, recently gave a speech over the radio to explain the purpose of this provision, stating that the new tariff bill took 18 months to pass. During these 18 months, American business was greatly shaken by the transition between the old and new tariff rates. Fortunately, the bill was announced and implemented, and this adverse situation of commercial shakiness can be eliminated from now on. It is impossible for any major policy to fully satisfy everyone, and tax bills are no exception. The provision for adjustable tariff rates, although still subject to attack, is necessary because during this period of rapid economic progress in our country, commercial situations change rapidly. Sticking to fixed rules will lead to the disadvantage of sitting still and not adapting. This is why President Hoover has strongly promoted the provision for adjustable tariff rates. The so-called adjustable tariff rates do not mean that the President can arbitrarily increase or decrease them. They must first be considered by experts on the Tariff Commission to be feasible and then submitted to the President for approval. Moreover, the Commission's special power is not without restrictions. The rate of increase or decrease must not exceed 50% of the original rate. The deputies carefully considered this tariff bill when it was originally negotiated, but human power is limited and changes are endless. Errors are inevitable. The method of adjustment is precisely to correct this defect, so that experts can correct it at any time. Any organization must have safety mechanisms, and adjustable tariffs are the safety mechanism of our American tariffs. Among the world's major businesses, our American tariff rates are the most fixed. In the past 50 years, there have only been eight changes, while other countries change their tariff rates several times a year. In all fairness, in this era of rapid economic change, innovation is the first priority. Furthermore, President Hoover's explanation of the adjustable tariff method is entirely for the convenience of other countries. In order to avoid diplomatic complications and delays, this committee of experts was established. Those in other countries who are dissatisfied with our country's new tariff rates can directly raise the issue with the Committee in order to find remedial measures. This is our America's deep concern for the convenience of friendly countries, and we trust that all countries will be able to understand it. Since the implementation of the tariff bill, countries have increasingly used retaliatory measures, and the suffering we have suffered is beyond description. We deeply wish to raise this issue with all countries in order to reach a fair resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Hurricane Hits Japan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>More Than 2,000 Houses Collapsed</p>
<p>Shipping Damage Reaches 300 Vessels</p>
<p>The Severity of the Disaster is Unprecedented</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 19th - The Central Meteorological Observatory announced at 10:30 this morning that the hurricane that struck the Kyushu area passed over the sea south of Gangwon Province, Korea, at 6:00 p.m. on the 18th and is heading northeast, seemingly toward Vladivostok. The Kyushu area is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th - According to news from Busan, the hurricane, after ravaging the Ryukyu Islands and Kyushu, struck southern Korea at noon today. Its intensity is the most severe in 40 years. There is no news of the loss and death toll in Korea. There are only scattered reports of the disaster in Kyushu. According to local authorities, the number of dead and injured in the three areas of Ryukyu, Kyushu, and Korea is estimated to be several hundred. Most of the deaths and injuries on land were caused by collapsed houses, but the number of deaths at sea is higher. All of Kyushu was affected, with Nagasaki being the worst hit. More than 50 vessels, from small steamships to sampans, sank in the harbor. Most of the people on board were on shore at the time and were spared, but those who remained on board met a tragic end. Several bodies have now been recovered. Countless roofs have been blown off.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 19th - The unprecedented storm that struck western Kyushu on the morning of the 18th had wind speeds sometimes exceeding 51 meters per second. As of this morning, the known damage is more than 2,000 collapsed houses and 300 damaged vessels. The severity of the damage is beyond imagination. Because the power lines were severely damaged, the region relies solely on radio broadcasts. However, the radio station on Kakushima Island cannot broadcast because the iron tower has collapsed. The Kumamoto broadcasting station cannot fully perform its function due to a lamp malfunction. Trains are unable to proceed or retreat everywhere, and communications are completely disrupted. Every effort is being made to restore the situation this morning. This morning it was determined that the vessels wrecked include the Yasukuni Maru (3,090 tons) and the Oshima Maru (5,400 tons), both off Tsushima, the Makuya Maru (290 tons) the Sixth Omi Maru (600 tons) off Yamaguchi Prefecture, and the Motoyama Maru (400 tons) off Kumamoto Prefecture, as well as countless other small ships and fishing boats. In Nagasaki Prefecture alone, there were more than 150, and more than 20 in Busan harbor. More than 100 drowned have been found today. The Motoyama Maru and Oshima Maru, among the large vessels damaged, were caught in the raging waves and sank. A brief description of the damage in various parts of Kyushu is given below.</p>
<p>Nagasaki City: Nagasaki City is in darkness due to the interruption of electricity supply throughout the city. More than 500 houses have collapsed, causing 10 million yen in damage. The ships sunk in the harbor include two steamships and 74 motorboats and other vessels. 155 vessels have been heavily damaged and washed away. The number of dead and injured inside and outside the prefecture is considerable. Details are not available due to the disruption of communications.</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Nagasaki, 19th - The storm in Nagasaki harbor was extremely severe. Eight steamships, 83 gasoline-powered vessels, and more than 60 sailing ships were destroyed. Bridges were severely damaged, and the loss to railway tracks is valued at 500,000 yen. As of 4:00 p.m. on the 18th, the damage in and outside Nagasaki City included 53 houses completely destroyed, 23 houses half-destroyed, 20 stores completely destroyed, 41 stores half-destroyed, 4 schools collapsed, 4 schools partially collapsed, and hundreds of houses flooded. Three people were crushed to death by collapsed houses. The total loss is estimated to be worth 20 million yen.</p>
<p>Fukuoka City: More than 2,000 houses have collapsed in Fukuoka City, and 25 people have been injured. Because telegraph and telephone lines have been cut, the evening newspaper cannot be published. The "Enemy Subduing Gate," a protected structure of the government-sponsored Hakozaki Shrine, and elementary schools have collapsed.</p>
<p>Kagoshima: Kagoshima City was ravaged by a storm for 12 hours starting on the morning of the 18th, causing mountain floods and collapsing more than 70 houses. There were 44 fires in Kagoshima Prefecture due to the storm, resulting in 6 deaths and 18 serious injuries.</p>
<p>Kumamoto City: The number of collapsed houses in Kumamoto City reached 200. Details of deaths and injuries are unknown.</p>
<p>Busan Harbor: The wreckage of fishing boats wrecked in Busan Harbor is floating on the sea this morning, with the corpses of the drowned floating on top of them. The scene is extremely tragic. About 500 houses were damaged, and most of the landfill work was washed away, leaving no trace.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Reval, 18th - An Estonian movement similar to the Finnish Lapua movement has occurred, but its motivation is due to opposition to heavy agricultural taxes and is different from Finland's opposition to its Communist Party.

<h3 id="e73">Japan Implements Budget Savings <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Actual Amount Less Than 40%</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 19th - The total amount of confirmed budget savings for this year, which was approved by the cabinet yesterday, is 60.052 million yen. However, a review of its contents reveals that the actual amount of savings is only 19.4444 million yen. The remaining 41 million yen is a temporary postponement and is entirely a numerical savings plan to cover the 60 million yen decrease in revenue. Various parties are quite disappointed with the result. The Minister of Finance, in regard to this matter, said to people that the reason why the actual savings in the budget could only reach 3.9% of the basic amount of 600 million yen is because he lacks the skills of a Minister of Finance, and he regrets this. The reason is that some projects in various ministries have already started, and there are goods that have already been contracted with the private sector, so they cannot be easily saved. When preparing the budget for the next year, he is determined to implement actual savings.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 19th - Minister of Finance Inoue reported on the amount of budget savings for each ministry at yesterday's cabinet meeting, which has been largely decided. Next, the guidelines for the preparation of the sixth year's budget were discussed. Minister of Finance Inoue's opinion is still to adhere to a tight policy. Of the government's expenditures, about 600 million yen can be saved, and it is planned to reduce or postpone 20% of them in order to save 120 million yen. As for the matter of using the surplus funds from the military reduction for tax cuts, which is generally expected, it seems that it was not mentioned. It is feared that it will not be applicable in the sixth year, because the treaty approval is delayed and the financial situation is difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Overview of the Guidance Huai River Committee's Work in the Past Year <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Guidance Huai River Committee was established in the capital city last July. The National Government appointed water conservancy expert Li Yizhi as the Director of the Engineering Department and Chief Engineer, responsible for all engineering matters. In August, the committee set up an office in Huaiyin to direct design and surveying engineers nearby, preparing for various construction projects. To cultivate engineering talent, outstanding high school graduates and junior military officers with military knowledge and experience were recruited to attend a training course for office personnel. The training concluded in April of this year, and graduates were assigned to various groups, survey teams, and hydrological stations for practical experience. In terms of fieldwork, the reconnaissance team, led by Mr. Li, set out on expeditions, reaching various rivers and lakes, including the Grand Canal, Gaobao Lake, Hongze Lake, the upper reaches of the Huai River to Sanhejian, the Zhangfu Diversion Canal, Sanhe, the abandoned Yellow River, the Guan River, the Salt River, the Central Canal, the downstream areas of the Yangtze River, the Yi River, the Shu River, the Wen River, and the Si River. Two survey teams were dispatched to survey routes for the Huai River to enter the Yangtze River and the sea. Hydrological, water level, and rainfall stations were set up in various ports along the Huai River and the coastal areas east of the Grand Canal, such as Zhongdu Wharf, upstream of Shuangjin Sluice, downstream of the Salt River Sluice, upstream and downstream of the Huaiyin Tianfei Sluice, upstream and downstream of the Shuibeimen Six Sluices, Guazhou Dongwan Dam, Dongjiagou Bridge, Wanfu Bridge, Huojia Bridge, Bajangkou, Shatou, Sanjiangying, Hehuachi, Tiangang Town, Tangjiagou, Wuzhang Longgou, Yanweigang, Xiangshui Estuary, Chenjiagang, and Sanchakou Jinkou. Personnel were assigned to take daily observations as the basis for continued research on the hydrology of the Huai River basin. In terms of deskwork, topics included hydrological studies, such as the hydrodynamics of Hongze Lake, the water volume required for downstream navigation and irrigation, the water storage and flood reduction of Hongze Lake, the frequency of floods in the Huai River, and the impact of the Huai River entering the Yangtze River. Various estimates related to flood discharge projects included guiding water from Gaobao Lake into the Yangtze River, from the abandoned Yellow River into the sea, from the Zhangfu River, the Salt River, and the Guan River into the sea, from the Sheyang Lake River into the sea, as well as the South Grand Canal Lake Plan, the Yi River and Shu River Flood Discharge Plan, and the Upper Reaches of the Huai River Plan. Also included were various construction plans, such as various movable weirs, dams, and ship locks. The committee also hired Professor Fang Xius of Hanover University in Germany as a consultant engineer. He arrived in Beijing last November and, together with Director Li, inspected key areas and studied drawings in detail. After thorough examination, the most beneficial and economical plan for flood control, irrigation, and transportation was determined as the Guidance Huai River Plan. It has now been compiled into a book, rich in content, with over thirty accurate illustrations. To gather more ideas, the committee plans to invite representatives from relevant provincial governments in the Huai River basin and central water conservancy agencies, as well as about twenty researchers who have long studied the Huai River, to organize a discussion meeting in August for further research and preparation for submission to the committee for reference. It will then be submitted to the general assembly for review and approval before being presented to the National Government for implementation.</p>

The current status of fisheries in the coastal counties of southern Jiangsu, such as Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, Jinshan, and Songjiang, was investigated. The results show that there are more than 120 fishing boats of various sizes in the counties, with about 2,000 fishermen. Nanhui County has the most, with 60 fishing boats and 800 fishermen, followed by Songjiang County. There are five types of fisheries: (1) Deep-sea seine fishing. This net is similar to a drift net and is a fixed fishing gear. The fishing season is from Grain Rain (around April 20) to early July each year. The fishing ground is northwest of Daji Mountain and northeast of Tongsha. During the peak fishing season, each boat can catch more than 40 loads of fish, and at least four or five loads. The value of one fishing season ranges from 2,000 to 6,000 yuan. The fish are mostly Spanish mackerel, shad, yellow croaker, and reeves shad. (2) Gillnet fishing. The most fishing boats of this type are in Songjiang and Chuansha counties. The fishing ground is northeast of Daji Mountain, southwest of Jigujiao, and on the north side of the shipping route. The fishing season is divided into two periods each year: April to June is the first period, and July to December is the second period. The catches are eel, yellow croaker, reeves shad, pomfret, Spanish mackerel, anchovy, yellowfin tuna, and saury. However, the second period is mostly for gillnetting jellyfish and anchovy. The value of each boat per year is about 500 to 2,000 yuan. (3) Seine fishing. The fishing method of this fishery is the same as that of gillnet fishing, specializing in catching anchovy and white shrimp. The fishing ground is northwest of Daji Mountain or 40 miles south of Fengxian City. The fishing season is six months, from March to June and September to December. The value of each boat per year is about 800 to 1,400 yuan. (4) Line fishing. This fishery is divided into boat fishing and wading fishing. Wading fishing will disappear due to the small catch. The boat fishing ground is northeast of Daji Mountain and northwest of Beitingshingshan. The fishing season starts in March each year, and the catches are sea bass, croaker, red stingray, and sole. The value of each boat per year is between 1,000 and 2,000 yuan. (5) Insert net fishing. This fishery is the lightest in capital, generally as a sideline for coastal residents. Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, Jinshan, and other counties all have it. The catch is not large, and the annual fishing value is about 100 yuan. Except for four boats that are solely owned, the fishing boats of the above fisheries are mostly partnerships. The hired crew members earn about 200 yuan per fishing season, but each person is allowed to bring a net, which can earn 20 to 30 yuan. Therefore, the boat owners charge the crew members 5% to 15% of the fishing value as boat fare, but the old crew members are exempt. Each fishing season, fishermen from the coastal counties drive small boats to the fishing grounds, braving the waves, without ice and salt. The equipment on the boat is simple, and there is no preparation for sleeping, cooking, etc. When the weather is bad and storms hit, it is difficult to return to port. Many islands and bays that can shelter from the wind are haunted by pirates, so they dare not go. If there are consecutive days of storms, the fish will rot due to lack of ice and salt, and eventually be discarded into the sea. Several days of hard work will be in vain. Moreover, the arrangement of fishing gear in fishing grounds is often broken by foreign ships, or the ropes are cut off by Zhejiang drift net boats because they hinder their fishing, causing them to drift away. It is already fortunate to preserve people and boats, and I don't know who to talk to. The Department is currently planning to improve and protect all of these aspects. (2) Investigation of fish fry business. The production of fish fry has gradually decreased in recent years, which has become a major problem for the fish farming industry. On the 10th of last month, the Department of Agriculture sent technician Li Zhaohui and Liu Tongshen, a technician from the Aquaculture Experiment Station of the Fisheries School, to investigate the fish fry business in Lianbi, Gaozi, Ayu, and other places near Zhenjiang. They paid special attention to the production areas, collection methods, transportation methods, rearing methods, and sales conditions of fish fry.</p>
<p>(B) Guidance matters. On May 2, the Department sent technician Hou Zhaohai and propagandist Huang Kezhuang to Wusong and Hupu to gather fishermen and show fishery films for publicity. When showing fishery films in Hupu, the leaders of the Hupu fishery were convened to discuss the decline of Chinese fisheries, the lack of technology, and the incomplete material equipment. It was reported that Japan catches more than 50 million yuan worth of yellow croaker alone in Chinese territorial waters every year. It was also announced that the Department is now dividing Jiangsu's fish production areas into five fishing areas and fishing bases, and is preparing to establish fishery guidance offices in the central areas of each region to guide the improvement of fisheries, the structure of fishing boats, and the organization of cooperatives, as well as discuss the dredging of Hupu Port, the rescue of Hupu fishery, and the installation of a lighthouse in Hupu Port.</p>
<p>(C) Dredging matters. After the Department convened fishery leaders in Hupu to discuss, according to the on-site survey of technician Hou Zhaohai in Hupu Port, the deepest part of the port is only five feet, which is inconvenient for fishing boats and merchant ships to enter and exit. Hupu is a prosperous fishing area. If dredging is not carried out, it will hinder the future development of the fishery. A special consultation was made to the Department of Construction to instruct the Construction Bureau of Changshu County Government to quickly survey and dredge, and the required funds will be disbursed under the water conservancy project.</p>
<p>(D) Suppression matters. The Department believes that fishing with cuttlefish (ie, cuttlefish) cages seriously hinders the reproduction of aquatic products, and issued a public notice to ban it. It also sent letters to the Fourth District Headquarters of the Water Police Team and the governments of coastal counties to investigate and ban it at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Hubei Provincial Government Strives for Special Tax Surcharges <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams to the Ministry of Finance list five reasons</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence. The Hubei Provincial Government believes that the special tax surcharge is the basic funding for the province's rural cleansing and bandit suppression, which is crucial to the future of public security. Previously, the Two Lakes Special Tax Office collected it on behalf of the province. However, during the tenure of a certain director, corruption was rampant, and the regular tax revenue sharply decreased, which greatly affected the surcharge. Therefore, it was decided at the political affairs meeting to set up a bureau to collect the surcharge, so as to assign special responsibility, and Gui Jingqiu was appointed as the director. The office has begun to work and is actively proceeding. However, the Special Tax Office argued that it would hinder the income of the regular tax and petitioned the Commander-in-Chief's Office and the Ministry of Finance to order the abolition. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen has telegraphed the provincial government according to the situation, proposing to allocate 200,000 yuan per month from the special tax revenue to subsidize, seeking consent. Yesterday, the provincial government telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, mainly stating that (1) The purpose of holding this special tax surcharge is that the local finances are on the verge of collapse and there is no way to make up for it, and the bandits are rampant, and the rear defense is worrying. It is urgent to suppress bandits and cleanse the countryside, but there is no funding at all. We have to open up another tax source and strive to save ourselves. (2) The security corps, the joint defense zone, the general security corps, and the garrison brigade implement rural cleansing and bandit suppression, and subsidize the stationed Hubei National Army for bandit suppression and kidnapping expenses, so as to protect the locality and consolidate the rear defense. These expenses are all outside the budget, and it is even more impossible to fill them without opening up another tax source. (3) Before the 15th year, the special tax was mainly handled by Hubei Province. Because of the effective anti-smuggling, the monthly income was 2 to 3 million yuan. Now the tax rate has doubled, but the tax revenue has not improved. The anti-smugglers are not solely responsible, and smugglers are allowed to flood in. If the provincial government assists in anti-smuggling, formal merchants are willing to follow, and the regular tax revenue will be more prosperous. (4) The provincial government and the Special Tax Office have a common interest. If the Special Tax Office is willing to help each other and cooperate, smugglers will inevitably disappear, both sides will supervise each other, corruption will be eliminated, and the regular tax and surtax will be prosperous. It is truly beneficial to both sides without hindering each other. (5) The central government and Hubei Province are closely related. If 200,000 yuan is allocated from the regular tax, it will be shared by the central government. If the surcharge is collected, it will be taken from the opium smokers. Finally, it was stated that if this move is detrimental to the central government, even if it is beneficial to the local area, we are unwilling to do it, and we dare not do it. After careful consideration, it is truly beneficial to both sides. We deeply hope that you will consider the local security and the importance of the rear defense, abandon floating words, so that we can proceed according to the plan. (July 18)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Recent Business Situation in the Northwest West River of Guangdong <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence. Whether the business transportation in the northwest rivers is smooth or not directly affects the business of the entire province. Recently, due to various reasons, the business situation in the two rivers is different. The recent situation is investigated as follows:</p>
<p>North River. The North River goes far to Hunan and Jiangxi, and has the convenience of Guangdong road transportation, so the business is very large. Last month, due to the intrusion of Zhang Gui's army into Hunan, the Eighth Route of the Anti-Rebellion Army took the North River into Hunan to intercept. Guangdong Road was busy transporting troops north and transporting military supplies, so the departure of freight cars could not follow the usual practice. It was not until the 7th of this month that they started to travel as usual. During this period, the Guangdong side coveted the North River business, which had an impact. The North River's various local products could not be transported to the province because there were no cars. All the places in Shaoguan, Maba, Wushi, Yingde, and Yuantan were piled up like mountains. The goods shipped north from the province could not be transported either. At the same time, the transportation from the North River to Hunan was also slightly stagnant, and it was almost in a semi-suspended state. Fortunately, the military affairs in Hunan Province ended soon, and business transportation resumed immediately. Other transportation soon completely returned to normal. Recently, the goods transported from the North River to the province are quite crowded. Because it is the early harvest season, new grains account for the most, and firewood and charcoal are also transported in large quantities. The rest are paper, livestock, and various local products. The goods transported from the province are cotton yarn, cloth, seafood, and daily necessities. According to the shipping merchants, the early rice in the North River this year is quite a good harvest. The livelihood of farmers is relatively affluent in the midst of hardship. It is expected that their consumption power may be slightly better than before. In the near future, the North River business may improve.</p>
<p>West River. The prosperity and decline of the West River business is closely related to the situation in Guangxi Province. Most of the import and export of goods is based on Guangxi. Last month, Zhang Gui's army abandoned Guangxi and fled to Hunan, and the military affairs in Guangxi ended. At this time, the West River business could not be said to have returned to its original state, but it was gradually reviving. One proof of this is the increase in goods transported to Wuzhou in recent months. Even the upstream areas of Nanning and Liuzhou have goods coming and going with Wuzhou, and then transshipped to Guangdong. Unexpectedly, Zhang Gui's army recently returned to Guangxi, occupying Guilin with one part of the army. At the same time, Liuzhou, Nanning, and other places fell under the control of Zhang Gui's army. Therefore, the business transportation with the downstream was greatly affected again. According to the West River shipping merchants, there is no longer any goods going back and forth between Guilin and Liuzhou. The freight between Yong and Wu has also been suspended. A few days ago, three electric boats from Nanning loaded with goods and arrived in Wuzhou, but these boats seemed to be of a refuge nature. Because the situation in Nanning was not good, they rushed to transport all the existing goods to the west for sale. After this, there may be no freight coming. As for the goods transported from downstream, since receiving the telegram from Yong merchants yesterday to stop handling goods, most of them have stopped shipping. As for the goods transported from Guangzhou to the West River, except for the ports in Guangdong Province, such as are still shipped as usual, the number of shipments to Wuzhou has been reduced. It is found that the goods transported in recent days are mostly cotton yarn, cloth, etc. However, according to the speculation of some merchants, although the inland areas of Guangxi Province may be affected by military affairs, which hinders business, the agricultural affairs along the West River in Guangdong Province this year are still good, which may be able to make up for it slightly. And this military affair must be easier to end, so the business will not suffer major fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="e85">After the Qingdao Goods Donation Bureau Was Destroyed <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Asks the Municipal Government to Punish the Merchants Who Caused the Trouble</p>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Municipal Party Department on Behalf of the Merchants</p>
<p>Qingdao correspondence. Since the Qingdao Goods Unified Donation Bureau was destroyed by merchants who reported donations on the 10th of this month, the Bureau reported the situation to the Department of Finance on one hand, and convened an emergency meeting of important officials on the other hand, deciding to continue collecting donations as usual. According to the report from the Department of Finance, the Provincial Government also sent a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting that the merchants who rioted be severely punished in order to maintain the national tax. The local trade association, cotton yarn trade association, grocery store trade association, cotton cloth foreign goods grocery joint trade association, etc., have previously submitted petitions to the authorities for temporary suspension of collection, but were not approved. Now that this incident has been incited, the authorities not only do not know how to repent, but also will treat the merchants with harsh means. If this stalemate continues and everyone goes to extremes, it is feared that another major accident will occur. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to the General Chamber of Commerce, and forwarded it to the Municipal Steering Committee, requesting that the Qingdao Goods Unified Donation Bureau be allowed to suspend collection in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The submitted petition of the General Chamber of Commerce is recorded as follows: "According to the joint petition of the Qingdao Trade Associations, since the change of the political situation in Shandong Province, the unified donation transportation licenses issued by the Qingdao Bureau have been taken to the inland, and there have been various pains of repeated collection and retention, so that foreign customers are unable to answer when they question. It is impossible to do so. We have submitted a petition to your Association, requesting that the Qingdao Goods Unified Donation Bureau temporarily suspend the collection. Later, we received a copy of the letter from the Unified Donation Bureau, stating that since the Shandong Provincial Government temporarily moved to Qingdao, the merchants in our city did not understand the truth of the situation, and there were rumors of abolishing the unified donation. At first, we thought that most of the merchants in this city were pure and good people, and would never have any outrageous behavior. However, suddenly at 4:00 p.m. on the 10th, merchants who reported donations gathered many rioters and destroyed our Bureau and the branch Bureaus in the large and small ports for no reason. This is a disregard for the law and disrupts public security. The provincial and municipal governments have their own corresponding measures." Therefore, our Associations have thought about it again and again and are very surprised. Since submitting the petition to suspend the collection, all of our merchants have been specialized in approval in order to seek a solution. Why is there any outrageous behavior? Whether rioters took the opportunity to cause trouble or whether there are other functions of the Bureau staff is difficult to speculate. We think that merchants pay donations in the hope that they will be able to pass without hindrance. Now that there is an obstacle, we should ask the authorities to allow the suspension of collection in order to show consideration. Once the situation is settled and transportation is smooth, we will still follow the car handling procedure. We should appeal to your Association again to submit it to the authorities for approval, so as to relieve the merchants' difficulties. This is really a convenience, etc., to the Association. Therefore, our Association has found that the Associations' request to temporarily suspend the collection of goods unified donation is true. It is reasonable to submit the situation to your Association and ask you to observe the merchants' difficulties. During this period of transportation difficulties and cannot circulate, you will be pleased to inform the Goods Unified Donation Bureau to temporarily suspend the collection to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. This is really a public convenience." It is heard that after receiving the petition from the Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Steering Committee, because the Unified Donation Bureau belongs to the Provincial Government, has forwarded the situation to the Provincial Rectification Committee for investigation and handling.

<p>Ye Chucang, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, came to Hangzhou the day before yesterday afternoon because Chen Qicai, Director of the Department of Finance, resigned. He returned to Hangzhou from Shanghai. Ye personally came to persuade him to stay. It is heard that Chen has agreed to dispel his intention to resign. Ye returned to Shanghai yesterday and went to Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>The provincial straw hat donation of Zhejiang Province, which was previously approved by the Department of Finance, was recognized by Shen Chengfu, a merchant from Shanghai, and will be levied on the 21st of this month, and the various unified donation bureaus have been notified. Now the Yuyao Yaobei Straw Hat Trade Association has telegraphed to cancel the recognition. Yesterday, the Department approved that the straw hat export donation recognized by Shen Merchant is a straw hat donation exclusively for domestic sales, and the ocean-going straw hat donation is exempted from collection and is still handled according to the original plan. The request to cancel the recognition should not be discussed.</p>
<p>Zhou Changsheng, a Hangzhou drug robbery criminal, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital at the Jiangnan Nanxing Hotel and sent to the Provincial Government Security Office for interrogation.

<p>Continuation of the Murder Case. The County Government sent personnel to inspect the murder case in Anting Township. It is now learned that the inspected corpse was about thirty years old. At the District Office, the Wang clan identified him as an abductor, but at the corpse site, he was identified as his husband. The surname and address of the Wang clan itself differed from the previous statements. Even the name of the deceased, Chuan Pinhua, was fabricated on the spot. It is now proven that the man and woman were pigeon-releasing swindlers and have victimized four or five families. This time, it was matchmaker Zhou Peirong and others who discovered the flaws and attempted to escape, but were intercepted and beaten. There were five or six perpetrators. Qiao Er, who was arrested, claimed that he did not help in the crime because the remaining criminals were at large. The County Government is currently summoning witnesses, strictly arresting the fugitives, and holding another court hearing to achieve justice.</p>
<p>Good Condition of Agricultural Products. The major agricultural products of Jiayi are rice and cotton. At present, the early rice is about to spike, and the early cotton has blossomed. There are no insect pests or typhoon damage. The watermelons, grapes, and sorghum are exceptionally rich, which is rare in history.</p>

<p>Unauthorized Engraving of Official Seals Discovered and Thoroughly Investigated. On the 18th, a person named Jiang Anren sent someone to Gu Wenbao Qike Zipu in Xicheng with a sample and asked him to engrave two seals: "Songjiang County Education Bureau Seal" and the bureau chief's "Ni Han Chen Seal." He also asked him to engrave three seals for the Songjiang County Education Mistake Seal, and asked him to wrap them up and send them by 6:00 p.m. The Education Bureau noticed the matter and suspected Jiang Anren of the crime of unauthorized engraving of official seals. It immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to arrest Jiang. Director Yu of the branch office held a preliminary trial. Jiang's confession seemed to be neurological, and his attitude was abnormal. Yu ordered him to be handed over to the county government for review. Jiang was temporarily released on bail that night. It is found that Jiang Anren is currently an executive member of the County Education Association, the town chief of Guyang, and a teacher at the Second High School. During the recent turmoil at the Second High School, he was at the forefront of the student movement. He recently returned to Songjiang from Zhenjiang and told others that he had met with Director Chen of the Department of Education and discussed the education of Songjiang in detail. It is unknown what kind of stimulus he received, but he suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown and went beyond the scope, committing the act of unauthorized engraving of official seals. The Public Security Bureau has now handed over the case to the county for legal resolution.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Three Counties on Defense Matters. Hu Mingzao, the head of the First Regiment of the Anti-Smuggling Office stationed in Songjiang, is responsible for guarding the special affairs of Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qing counties. He convened a joint meeting of the three counties on the 18th. Head Hu chaired the meeting and reported on the intention of the meeting. The discussion was that the investigation of bandits in the three counties should be the responsibility of the county magistrates, who should instruct the Public Security Bureaus to be responsible for handling the matter, and the Public Security Bureaus should send a detective to be stationed at the headquarters to await dispatch. The northern section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway should be the responsibility of the police chief or station chief of that section, who should instruct the patrol officers to report at any time. If bandits are found in one county, other counties should be on alert at the same time and provide assistance. The transportation undertakings in each county should be maintained by the Public Security Bureau of that county, and the garrison troops in the location should be responsible for assisting. The officers and soldiers of this regiment who are swaggering outside or behaving irregularly must be apprehended or reported for rectification. Each county magistrate should conduct a thorough investigation and report on the public and private armed groups within their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Bandits Apprehended and Sent for Trial in the Five Warehouse Robbery Case. The Shen Yuan Gu family of Wuku Thirty-four Tu was robbed on June 28th. Shen, a patrol officer of the township, has apprehended Zhu Awu, a resident of this town, who confessed to robbing the Shen family. He has been handed over to the County Public Security Bureau and then to the County Government for legal action.</p>

<p>Continuation of the Case of the Construction Bureau Director Absconding with Funds. It is now learned that the County Magistrate Ruan Kaiji went to Shanghai on the morning of the 18th to investigate the case of Li Jingzhao, the director of the Chuansha County Construction Bureau, abandoning his post and absconding. He found that the construction special funds stored in the Bank of Communications totaled more than 18,000 yuan. In addition to more than 2,000 yuan of the special funds being used as advances for labor to build the Chuanqin County Road, he illegally affixed the seals of the Jiangsu Construction Department and the Chuansha County Magistrate to steal more than 5,000 yuan. The last date signed on the check was July 8th. He then took a car back to the county and urgently telegraphed the Provincial Construction Department to report the matter and request instructions.</p>
<p>Convening a Defense Meeting. After the garrison troops of this county were ordered to return to Shanghai, County Magistrate Ruan Kaiji convened a defense meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, gathering the Public Security Bureau, the Police Team, and the Water Police Sub-Team. As a result, the urban defense was redistributed. In addition to sending police to check at the station, the port, and the shipping boats during the day, traffic was prohibited from 11:00 p.m. every night.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Suzhou <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Truth About the Arrest of Communists: In the case of Suzhou arresting communists, this newspaper has already given a brief account. It is now known that this matter began on the 16th of this month when postal inspectors at the Changmen Wai post office intercepted a bundle of reactionary publications addressed to Wei Junhong of Le Yi Girls' School for forwarding to Wu Shijie. This was reported to party and government personnel, who, together with the police, went directly to Le Yi at Wang Feiji. There, they found only the administrative director, Wei Pi. After repeated questioning, they learned that Junhong was Wei Pi's real name. According to his confession, he had received such printed materials several times before and had handed them over to Jiang Weixi. He himself had once opened and read one. Jiang was a classmate from when he attended the county junior high school and is now studying at a certain middle school in Shanghai. Because of the summer vacation, he was also residing at Le Yi. When Jiang was questioned, he said that he had an old acquaintance with Cai Zhihua and that after the reactionary publications were sent to Suzhou, Cai would always get them from Wei. He also said that Cai would be coming that day to pick up a letter. A search of Jiang's person yielded a page of unsigned stationery; the envelope had already been destroyed. The party and government personnel searching the school then took Wei and Jiang to the Public Security Bureau and then went to No. 1 Chuanfang Lane, where they arrested Cai Zhihua. At the same time, near Canglang Pavilion, they arrested a female student who looked suspicious and was carrying multiple reactionary publications. After being taken to the bureau, she identified herself as Yang Zhongxian, 19 years old, from Sichuan, and currently a member of the Zhongshan Physical Education School's Girl Scouts. Subsequently, those arrested confessed to the involvement of Zhang Yimin, Wang Menglu, Ge Naibin, Gu Linfan, and others. The Public Security Bureau conducted separate searches at their addresses. They arrested Zhang Yimin and Ge Naibin at a primary school in the city center. Zhang Chongchun, a teacher at Shen Xiao Primary School, and Ge, a teacher at the school in the city center. They also found dozens of reactionary books at Gu Linfan's home at No. 35 Liu Lane. This is the true story of the case from beginning to end. It is also heard that the party and government authorities yesterday (the 19th) presented the details to the Provincial Rectification Committee for handling, and the Provincial Rectification Committee has scheduled to send personnel to Suzhou within days to investigate and verify.</p>
<p>Furthermore, around 1 AM the previous morning, the Public Security Bureau received a tip that there were many communists holding a secret meeting at the Zhonghua Hotel outside the Changmen gate. After receiving the report, the director ordered dozens of armed police officers to rush to the hotel, surround it, and arrest the main offenders, Wang Guangming and Xu Yuanzhang (native place unknown), along with eighty-eight reactionary flags and numerous symbols. They were immediately detained in the Public Security Bureau. Under preliminary interrogation by the director, they confessed to plotting to seize local military and police firearms and occupy the city of Suzhou.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, around 8 PM, wounded soldiers caused a disturbance in the city. All city gates were closed, and shops closed down. A guard standing at the Guangji Bridge pier was taken away by the wounded soldiers, and another policeman was severely beaten. The third branch of the Public Security Bureau and the second station were robbed of a sentry gun by the wounded soldiers. It is said that there were more than 300 wounded soldiers. After the incident, the military and police authorities announced temporary martial law and cut off transportation.</p>

<p>Mediation Conference on Labor-Management Disputes in Silk Factories: Due to unresolved disputes over revisions to the labor-management contract, Wuxi silk factories have been delayed for a long time. The County Party Rectification Committee, having accepted the requests of both labor and management, and following the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, originally scheduled a mediation conference for both parties on the 8th of this month. However, due to the management's failure to put forward responsible representatives, it was postponed to the afternoon of the 18th and held at the County Party Rectification Committee. On that day, 45 representatives from all factories on the management side and 23 male and female committee members from the labor side attended. Representatives from the County Government's Labor Rectification Committee and the County Chamber of Commerce also attended. Zhang Renjie, a member of the Public Education Committee, chaired the meeting. He first reported the purpose of the mediation, and then both parties began discussions lasting four hours. The results were as follows: (1) The issue of revising the contract will be resolved by a mediation committee organized by the party and government organs within a short period. (2) Before the new contract is finalized, the original state should be maintained in accordance with the old contract, and wages for memorial days stipulated by the central government should be paid as usual. (3) All factories that went on strike today should resume work uniformly, and the trade union should be responsible for ensuring that there are no more strikes in factories that have not gone on strike. (4) The forced strike of five factories today will be thoroughly investigated by the party and government, and strict action will be taken according to the law. After the above was discussed, the chairman declared that the silk factories' poor business performance was indeed a fact, but the rising cost of living for workers was also difficult. Both parties should act in the spirit of labor-management cooperation, remove prejudices, and make concessions to facilitate a solution. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Homicide and Robbery Case - On-site Investigation: Wang A'de, a migrant living in Shangwen'an Village, Meijing, 16th District (Wan'an), was shot and killed by robbers the previous night while pursuing them. The next day, Chen Genze, a cousin of the deceased, reported the case to the county government and requested an investigation. Yu, an investigator from the county government, led police officers to conduct an on-site investigation. It was found that the deceased had been shot three times, with one bullet entering the left abdomen and exiting through the back, which was the fatal wound. It was also learned that the deceased Wang A'de's family was extremely poor, but they had received a hundred yuan from a hui loan last month, which was coveted by the robbers. However, the money had already been used to pay off debts. The robbers were angered by not finding anything, and because A'de pursued them, he was killed. After questioning, Mr. Yu ordered the family to prepare a coffin and await the arrest of the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Labor Dispute in Five Silk Factories: The five silk factories in Zhou Shanbang, including Deda Yu, Ruichang, Qianfeng, Wan Yi, and Yuanfeng, suddenly experienced a strike at around 6 AM the day before yesterday, and the atmosphere was tense for a time. After this incident occurred, the county government, the county party headquarters, and the county public security bureau all sent teams to suppress the situation and maintain order. Finally, Zhou Fengjing, the leader of the county party headquarters, and Lu Qi, a representative of the county government, did their best to mediate between labor and management, persuading both parties to settle the matter and ensure peace. Representatives of both parties were willing to respect the leaders of the party and government, maintain production increases, and agreed to resume work immediately. Therefore, yesterday morning (the 19th), the female workers of the five factories, including Deda Yu, all resumed work and worked as usual.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Notice Regarding the Large-Scale Stamp Tax Inspection: The Zhenjiang Stamp Tax Bureau has a customary practice of conducting a large-scale inspection every six months. This inspection period is scheduled for the 21st of this month. In accordance with the regulations, the police will be involved and will seriously start the inspection in the areas under their jurisdiction. The Chamber of Commerce was notified in advance to inform all stores that if there are any items that have not yet been affixed with stamps, they must be affixed in accordance with the regulations to avoid omissions and penalties. After approving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce specifically notified all stores yesterday to pay special attention to avoid misunderstandings occurring temporarily. Establishment of Rice Inspection Offices in Jiangsu Province: In Jiangsu Province, rice is usually allowed to circulate within the province without restrictions. However, private smuggling out of the province and leakage into the sea are prohibited. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs believes that the rice circulation passports previously issued have many drawbacks, so it has cancelled the passports and formulated new measures to punish rice smuggling and leakage into the sea. The measures have been submitted to the Provincial Committee for discussion and approval, and orders have been issued for compliance. It is now found that the areas along the Yangtze River and the sea in Jiangsu Province and the counties bordering neighboring provinces are vast, making smuggling easy. If special agencies are not set up to seriously inspect and verify, it will be impossible to prevent smuggling and hold people accountable. Therefore, it is stipulated that eight inspection offices should be set up in Shanghai, Wuxi, Tongshan, Donghai, Jiangpu, Yixing, Wujiang, Jiangning, and other counties at important land and water intersections, and that regulations should be formulated and approved for implementation. It is also ordered that all regulations attached to the previous collection of permit fees should be abolished.</p>

<p>Successors to District Chiefs After Training in the Provincial Capital: Eight or nine out of ten district chiefs in various counties have been ordered to go to the provincial capital for training. The successors to their original vacancies in various counties are not consistent. Taking Jiangdu as an example, most of the district chiefs who were ordered to transfer have been guaranteed to be replaced by their respective district public office assistants. However, in general, there are still three district chiefs from the second graduating class who have not been able to obtain vacancies to this day. These three believe that since the first class has been transferred to the provincial capital for training, the vacancies should naturally be filled by them first, and only after a while can they be filled by various assistants. This is one point of contention. In addition, the regulations for selecting district chiefs have been issued to the county, and many ambitious people are rushing to the county to register. Although the date for passing the selection is still far away, there are many who are planning in advance to fill the above vacancies.</p>

<p>Second Group of Wounded Soldiers Arrive in Nantong for Treatment at Langshan: The 31st Rear Hospital was established in Xiaoying in the west of Nantong City and the Poor People's Factory. On the 17th, more than 700 wounded soldiers were transported there. On the 18th, another 800 wounded soldiers were transported by the Xinchang ship. Because the hospital was insufficient to accommodate them, the original plan was changed, and a treatment branch was established in Langshan. Guanyin Rock, Guandi Temple, and the Sericulture Field are all full. On the 19th, there was still a third group coming to Nantong on the Daji ship. Local communities believe that since the number of wounded soldiers transported has exceeded 1,000, it will be difficult to have more coming. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Military Affairs to petition.</p>
<p>Repelling Pirate Ships at Da'an Port Requires the Joint Action of Tongzhou and Haimen Counties: More than 30 pirate ships suddenly arrived at Da'an Port, the border between Tongzhou and Haimen counties. Pirates landed one after another, robbing and kidnapping people. Merchants and residents of the port fled. The 4th District Headquarters sent the Tongzhou Water Police Team stationed there to suppress them, and the Chengji and Ce Dian warships were also called in to assist in the attack. By the 18th, the pirate ships had completely retreated to the northeast.</p>

<p>Villagers Greatly Alarmed: Since the remnants of the Sifeilin Third Division fled to Xiaoying on the evening of the 13th in Huaiyin Third District, although they were forced away by the various joint village self-defense groups, the people's hearts were still uneasy, and there were inevitably rumors from time to time. On the evening of the 15th, before the setting sun had even fallen, the villagers along the northern bank of the Yanhe River, including Shilijing, Shijia Dawang, and the eastern bank of Da Hong, suddenly fled in all directions, supporting the old and carrying the young, as if a great disaster was about to occur. However, there is nothing strange in the world. Coincidentally, on that evening, more than a dozen new soldiers from the Second Division rushed to the Xiaoying Yanhe Ferry. At that time, the pontoon bridge had already been removed, and it was dark. Residents on the opposite bank could not distinguish them. Together with the villagers' flight that afternoon, there were many doubts. Therefore, merchants in Wangying and Xiba towns were especially prepared. In Wangying, the Public Security Corps and the Public Security Bureau派出所 all sent out teams. Xiba was even more prepared, with all of the Salt Defense Camp, Smuggling Suppression Camp, and Salt Transport Escort Team departing to set up outposts in places such as Huihui Ying, Hehua Wang, and Wutiao Road. A machine gun was set up at the intersection of Wutiao Road to prepare for unforeseen circumstances. On the one hand, the merchants of Wangying, seeing that the new soldiers were frequently calling for a ferry, found it difficult to ignore them. They temporarily appointed two representatives to cross the Yanhe River in a small boat to find out what was going on. When they arrived, they saw that the new soldiers had no weapons and were definitely not bandits. They first politely asked them to wait until this morning (the 16th) to cross the river, offering them food and lodging for the night. Seeing that the situation was difficult to refuse, they simultaneously called for a ferry to the south bank, and at that moment, the group's doubts were dispelled.</p>
<p>Former County Magistrate Chen Sends Personnel for Handover: When the former Huaiyin County Magistrate Chen Buchan stepped down, there were still some items in the various accounts he had handled that had not been cleared up. He specifically sent Hu Shaomei with funds to Huaiyin to clear the accounts some days ago. However, Hu brought 1,600 silver dollars from Chen, but after arriving in Pu, he did not hand over the money. The current County Magistrate Xu said that the handover of Chen's term was being urgently urged by the provincial and departmental authorities. Now that Hu has come as Chen's representative, he can be held responsible for clearing the accounts. Therefore, the police were sent to monitor Hu's residence at the Jisheng Society. At the same time, a telegram was still sent to Chen urging him to come quickly to clear the remaining procedures so that the case could be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Conference on the Construction of Iron Gates at Dasong Port: The construction of iron gates at Dasong Port in Yinxian County to block salt and store fresh water is of great importance for the irrigation of farmland in the Daxian area. The Yinxian County Government, together with local people, organized a preparatory committee and elected County Magistrate Chen Baolin and Head of the Construction Section Ni Weixiong as the chairman and vice-chairman. Preparations have been going on for several months. Now that Hu Jianfen, a technician from the county government, has completed the survey and the engineering outline has been drafted, the committee specially convened a standing committee yesterday to discuss the progress of the project and other important issues in order to see its completion as soon as possible. It is heard that the engineering fund is tentatively set at 100,000 yuan, and personnel will be sent to Nantong and Shaoxing to inspect the gate projects in those two places for reference.</p>
<p>Command Headquarters Sends Teams to Vigorously Suppress Pirates: The Command Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits in the four prefectures of Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, and Wenzhou stationed in this port recently received reports that pirates in the area near Xiangshan Port were colluding with local bandits from various counties to take advantage of the situation. After receiving the report, Commander Wang immediately transferred two marine police detachments and a guerrilla detachment to rush to the area for suppression, together with patrol ships. They suddenly encountered bandits in the Qingzi Port area and immediately engaged in fierce fighting. The Ministry of the Navy, upon hearing the news, also sent the Jinxing gunboat to the waters off Shenjiamen to join forces with the security team of the provincial government to encircle and suppress them. One bandit leader was killed on the spot. The bandits then fled in three routes. Martial law was immediately declared in the Xiangshan Port area. The Zhejiang Customs Supervisory Office also notified the shipping companies operating on the Zhejiang seas to temporarily suspend all coastal merchant ships to avoid accidents. All the suppression troops are currently pursuing and suppressing the bandits separately.</p>
<p>The Black Market for Rice Merchants Manipulates Rice Prices During the Fair Price Sale: Since the local Civil Food Relief Association has been running the fair price sale, the poor have benefited greatly. However, the market price of rice in the city suddenly dropped from sixteen yuan and eight jiao to twelve yuan and eight jiao within the last few days, a sharp drop of four yuan. The Civil Food Association believed that since the price of rice had fallen, it was about to start wrapping up and planned to sell off the remaining rice. Yesterday, someone familiar with the rice industry came to the association and reported that the sharp drop in the price of rice was not a real rise or fall in the price of rice. According to the Shanghai rice price calculation, it should be at least six liang or more, which is difficult to sell at twelve yuan and eight jiao. It was a few unscrupulous merchants who planned to first lower the price of rice so that the Civil Food Association's stored rice could be sold and the fair price sale could be concluded. After achieving their goal, they would then raise the price of rice again. At that time, even if the Civil Food Association could find a way, it would be of little help. These people would then be able to make a big profit. After hearing this report, the Civil Food Association immediately issued a notice overnight to convene an emergency meeting this morning to discuss how to resolve the case.</p>

<p>Joint Suppression of Bandits at the Border of He Liu Counties: Bandits are rampant at the border of He Liu Counties. Some days ago, two gangs of bandits, Quan Chengchui and Zhang Wenzhong, robbed and kidnapped people in the Yulin Gang area. The Shuanghe Bandit Disaster Relief Committee, upon hearing the news, sent Captain Yang to lead a team to join the Shijiaqiao Defense Army in Liuan County, the Shangxia Bao Joint Village Association, and 500 members of the Red Spear Society to suppress them. They fought the bandits at Huang Dacang until night, when the bandits were finally unable to hold out and retreated towards Shu County. At that time, eight bandits were killed, and the two bandit leaders, Fang Qingxu and Wei Dasan, were captured alive, along with more than 20 bandits, all of whom were executed on the spot on the west bank.

<p>(II) Revised Standards for Expenses of Students Studying in Europe, America, and Japan</p>
<p>Due to the different selection and supplementation periods for government-funded and subsidized students studying in European, American, and Japanese countries in Jiangsu Province, the amount of funding varies. In addition, the study abroad laws give additional national currency to the students studying in France and Belgium. The Jiangsu Department of Education has repeatedly received requests from government-funded and subsidized students that the high cost of gold and the low value of silver are affecting their studies, and they have requested that measures be taken to remedy this. After separately investigating the funding methods of various provinces for sending students abroad and considering that the study abroad expenses exceeded the budget by tens of thousands due to the impact of the high cost of gold last year, it is now specifically revised. For these students, the payment of gold currency in the country where they are studying is changed. It is estimated that an additional 20,000 yuan will be needed. It was proposed to the Jiangsu Education Expense Committee to increase the budget for study abroad expenses. Starting from the autumn of the 19th year, it is stipulated that all students studying abroad will be paid in the gold currency of the country where they are studying, and the additional tuition and experimental fees will be cancelled. The revised payment amounts are listed on the left:</p>
<p>United Kingdom (Government-funded): 20 pounds sterling per month per student</p>
<p>(Subsidized): 9 pounds sterling per month per student</p>
<p>Germany (Government-funded): 4 official marks per month per student</p>
<p>(Subsidized): 160 marks per month per student</p>
<p>France (Government-funded): 1,600 francs per month per student</p>
<p>(Subsidized): 600 francs per month per student</p>
<p>Belgium (Government-funded): 1,500 francs per month per student</p>
<p>(Subsidized): 600 francs per month per student</p>
<p>United States (Government-funded): 100 US dollars per month per student</p>
<p>(Subsidized): 45 US dollars per month per student</p>
<p>Japan (Government-funded): 90 yen per month per student</p>
<p>(Subsidized): 50 yen per month per student</p>
<p>In the future, the selection and supplementation of government-funded and subsidized students in Europe, America, and Japan will be based on the above-fixed standard expenses. However, the following items must still be handled separately: 1. French subsidized students who have received subsidies from the Sino-French University will still be given 400 yuan of national currency per year according to the old plan. 2. Japanese students who are supplemented with the Boxer Indemnity funds and whose subsidies have been approved under the old plan will still be given 240 yen per year according to the old plan.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Chinese Expedition Football Team Arrives in Singapore (Zuodu) <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>South China Football Team Just Finished Competing in Singapore</p>
<p>The Expedition Team Arrives One After Another, Reducing the Warm Welcome</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Singapore, July 10th) The Chinese Expedition Football Team arrived in Singapore on July 1st via the Kanymaru Maru from Shanghai via Hong Kong. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Singapore at 5:00 PM yesterday (9th), but the ship failed to arrive on time, so it only berthed at Pier 18 at 6:30 AM this morning (10th). The enthusiasm for this trip to Singapore does not seem high. The number of people welcoming the team was not very large. Even the number of reporters from newspapers was less than thirty when the team arrived. Mr. Yu Zhuohua, President of the Chinese Sports Association, only arrived to welcome the team twenty minutes after the ship arrived. In short, the arrival of this team in Singapore was not as lively as the arrival of the Lok Wah team last time. However, when the Hong Kong South China team came to Singapore at the end of last month (6th), before the ship arrived, welcomers had already gathered with banners welcoming the South China team, waving in the wind. Furthermore, the ticket prices for domestic football teams coming to Singapore for competitions are extremely high. Taking the South China team's two matches in Singapore as an example, the second time, the ticket sales were only four-fifths of the first time. And since the competition between South China and the local Malaysian Chinese mixed team and the Singapore mixed team is not over ten days, the ticket issue for the upcoming expedition team is really worrying. When examining the passports, Yu Zhuohua said to Li Huitang, "I am afraid that people in Singapore will not enthusiastically welcome your team, because the South China team arrived not long ago (Now it is in the Malaysia Cup A competition)." After the passports were examined, passengers and other people went ashore at will, and many team members also landed. Li Huitang and Yu Hengzhi were still on board with Yu Zhuohua, discussing remedial measures for about twenty minutes before disembarking. By the time the photo was finished, it was already past 8:00 AM. How things will proceed, I will continue to report.</p>
<p>Attached below are the Lok Wah's previous results in Singapore: 1 to 0 victory over the Malaysian Chinese United Team, 1 to 1 draw with the European United Team, 3 to 2 victory over the Welsh Garrison, 3 to 1 victory over the Singapore Chinese United Team.</p>

<p>Arsingger Wins</p>
<p>(New York Electric, 17th) The World Lightweight Boxing Championship was held in New York on the evening of the 17th. Al Singger and former champion Sammy Mandell agreed to a fifteen-round match. The crowd cheered and laughed, and the war clouds filled the arena. When the bell rang, the fierce battle began. Before the end of the first round, the outcome was decided. Under the force of Singger's punches, the former champion fell to the ground. The referee shouted ten times, but it was difficult to rouse his spirit for a final struggle. The title of World Lightweight Boxing Champion was placed upon Singger's head, and he received the celebration of the full house.</p>

<p>Regularly Holds Sports Lectures</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent) The Sports Council organized by the Japanese Ministry of Education has repeatedly consulted and sought rational promotion strategies for sports, and on July 8, the final consultation revised the resolution to answer the proposal on the control of sports organizations. A special committee will create a specific plan for implementation, and the requested budget for implementation expenses will be submitted for approval. Japanese authorities, in view of the extraordinary progress of sports, believe that the significance and effectiveness of sports have not yet been fully understood by the people, so they are eager to promote and popularize correct sports ideology. The Ministry of Education's Sports Division regards this as an urgent task at present and has carefully considered the following strategies: (1) Organizing sports exhibitions; (2) Regularly holding sports lectures; (3) Printing and distributing brochures to publicize the significance and effectiveness of sports as three key matters. Regarding the preparations for the exhibition, it is currently planned to start notifying local officials and powerful related organizations to collect display materials. With the goal of building a strong and healthy culture, the origin of sports to today's development will be covered. By gathering materials from China and abroad, it is preparing to complete and allocate funds from the sports facility fees to hold an unprecedented large-scale sports exhibition in Tokyo in late September or early October. After the closing, it is planned to exhibit in various cities in succession. In addition, films on sports will be produced and publicly shown everywhere, and brochures will be printed and distributed to actively popularize sports ideology.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Expresses Opinion on Foreign Intrusion of Police Power in Western Shanghai <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is very indignant about the foreign intrusion into the police power in the Caojiadu area of western Shanghai by building roads beyond the boundary. At the executive committee meeting the day before yesterday, it was decided to take five measures to deal with it. This has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. In addition to issuing a declaration, the Chamber of Commerce specially petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Government to follow the Prime Minister's instructions and promptly recover the concessions, and first recover the roads built beyond the boundary. At the same time, it also sent a letter to the Chinese taxpayers' association in the concessions, urging them to fight together. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Regarding the foreign intrusion of police power in western Shanghai, it is urgent to negotiate and recover the roads built beyond the boundary by the Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works as soon as possible in order to fundamentally resolve the issue. I respectfully submit my humble opinion, hoping for your review and implementation. It has been found that the heads of the Jing'an Temple and Putuo Road police stations of the Public Concession in this city went to the Sixth District Police Station three days ago and requested that the police posts at Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9 of Connaught Road, Singapore Road, and Edinburgh Road assigned by the district be revoked and replaced by police officers from the police station. A deadline of three days was given for a response. As of the 15th, the deadline had expired. The police station, because it did not receive a written reply from the acting director, sent an armed foreign police officer, leading six or seven Indian police officers, to patrol back and forth in the small vegetable market at the five corners of Edinburgh Road on the morning of the same day as a show of force. The Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the report, also dispatched a security team to the area to station. At more than 5:00 PM, the Jing'an Temple police station again sent two foreign police officers, eight Indian police officers, and more than ten Chinese police officers to the area to demonstrate. The Sixth District Police Station also sent more than 20 armed police officers to the area to guard it strictly. On the 16th, the Bureau of Public Works still simply sent a small number of patrol officers to patrol back and forth. The seventh and eighth police posts assigned by the Sixth District remained stationed in their original places. Acting Director Ren also dispatched a small number of security teams to patrol back and forth in the afternoon, but there was no confrontation like that on the 15th. When this situation was brought up for discussion at the second executive committee meeting of the affiliated association, it was generally believed that Edinburgh Road and other places were roads built beyond the boundary by the Bureau of Public Works, and all actions taken by foreigners in that area were infringements upon sovereignty, which our country has never recognized. Even in terms of police power, our country has gradually established police posts on the above-mentioned roads since the tenth year of the Republic of China. The police station has been indifferent to this. Now, it suddenly demands the withdrawal of police posts, and if its demands are not met, it intends to coerce with arms. Some commentators say that a third party is instigating this, and although the matter is confidential and difficult to speculate on, the cause of the conflict is all due to the construction of roads beyond the boundary. This matter has been negotiated for recovery many times, but after several years, there has been no result. If this case is not resolved for a day, our country's exercise of municipal power in that area will not be complete for a day, and there is a risk of side issues arising at any time. Now, your department is adhering to the Prime Minister's instructions and the central government's policies, and is still continuing to work hard to recover the treaty-established concessions. How can there be any hesitation in recovering the roads originally occupied and built beyond the boundary by foreigners, so as to prevent this from becoming a malignant tumor of municipal administration in this city and leaving behind a source of international provocation? All the reasons for preventing foreigners from seizing police power should start with recovering the roads built beyond the boundary, so as to achieve a fundamental solution. Therefore, I am writing to your department, hoping for your review, adoption, and implementation for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the petition to the Municipal Government is roughly the same, omitted).</p>
<p>Solemn Declaration: Since the Qing Dynasty, the opening of concessions has been stipulated in the treaties, specifying the four boundaries. The first article of the regulations of the concession north of the Yangjingbang River also first specifies the boundaries of the concession. Therefore, the so-called permission in Article 7 of the regulations to purchase land adjoining or separated from the concession for use as streets contradicts the provisions of Article 1 on boundaries. All land outside the concession is land under the jurisdiction of our country. How can the Bureau be allowed to arbitrarily dispose of land in our country that has not been opened based on the approval of the taxpayers' meeting (this is the original text of Article 7 of the regulations, referred to as "occupational landlords")? Therefore, Article 7 of the regulations, which is regarded by foreigners as the basis for building roads beyond the boundary, is, in strict legal terms, an act of encroachment. Our country's inherent sovereignty over that land cannot be infringed upon in the slightest. Moreover, in terms of facts, the Public Security Bureau has long established police posts and sent police officers to patrol Singapore Road, Edinburgh Road, and other places occupied and built beyond the boundary by foreigners since the 14th year of the Republic of China. The police station has long been at peace with this. Therefore, the so-called agreement between the "leader" and Sun Chuanfang has long been abandoned by the other party. How can it be used as a basis at this time? Therefore, the association believes that the police station's dispatch of a large number of armed patrol officers to the corner of Connaught Road and Edinburgh Road on July 15 to coerce the withdrawal of the police officers stationed there is tantamount to destroying the Bureau of Public Work's recent policies of seeking harmony with the Chinese people and improving Sino-foreign relations, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, at the second executive committee meeting of the association on the 18th of this month, it was decided to issue the above declaration, hoping that the people residing in western Shanghai will unite to correct this erroneous action of the concession authorities, and hoping that the people of the country and the citizens of the city will make unremitting efforts and enthusiastic expressions in support of police power and the recovery of concessions.</p>
<p>Letter to the Taxpayers' Association: Dear Sirs, the Public Concession Patrol Station's request to the Sixth District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau to withdraw the police officers at Police Posts 7 and 8 at the corner of Connaught Road and Edinburgh Road on the 16th and 17th of this month, and the dispatch of a large number of armed patrol officers to coerce and cause disturbances because the request was not granted, must have been read in the newspapers long ago. The association held its second executive committee meeting yesterday. Because your association is a group of Chinese taxpayers, it has always made responsible expressions on major issues such as recovering national rights and protecting the interests of citizens, which are enough to attract the attention of foreigners residing in Shanghai. This time, the foreign intrusion of police power in western Shanghai in our country is tantamount to overturning the precedent of stationing police officers since the 14th year of the Republic of China, and is an attempt to uphold its extra rights on the roads occupied and built beyond the boundary, and is a further expression of opposition to the recovery of concessions. Judging from its nature, it is extremely serious. Why has your association not made any expression? Moreover, according to the regulations of your association, an executive committee meeting should be held every month. In recent months, no meeting has been convened, which is incomprehensible. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is one of your members, and it is difficult to remain silent. It was decided that your association should immediately convene an executive committee meeting to fight together. I am sending this letter to inform you, hoping that you will investigate and handle it accordingly. Sincerely yours, Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Opportunity for India to Promote Chinese Silk <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Confidential Report from Lu Chunfang, Consul General in India</p>
<p>Since Gandhi was arrested and imprisoned by the British government, the Indian people's resistance to British goods has become increasingly fierce. They welcome goods imported from other countries, especially silk. Lu Chunfang, our country's consul general in India, in view of this, secretly submitted a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Commerce to order the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to send letters to various related organizations, dispatching personnel to India for on-site investigation and devising methods for improvement in order to develop trade with India. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has already sent letters to various silk industry organizations for investigation. The confidential report from Consul General Lu and the original letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Confidential Report from Consul General Lu: Regarding the confidential report that the Indian people are resisting British goods and that our country lacks banks and lawyers and cannot develop commerce and protect overseas Chinese, I respectfully submit my humble opinions for your review. I believe that the country's wealth comes from industry and commerce, and the people's security comes from the law. In recent years, the great powers have been paying attention to and promoting and protecting their respective countries' industries, commerce, and people at any time and any place. Our country's commerce has recently developed abroad, and there are nearly 10,000 overseas Chinese in India, all of whom are laborers. There are very few who are engaged in commerce, which is a major shortcoming. Since Gandhi was arrested by the British, the Indian people's resistance to British goods has become increasingly fierce. Even for daily necessities, all British products are rejected. They welcome goods imported from other countries. The opportunity for us to work together is once in a lifetime. There are three things that our country urgently needs to take advantage of. The first is to improve products. India's main products are tea and hemp, and the production of cloth is very small and of poor quality. The production of silk is even smaller. I saw that the shops in the New Market in that port were full of silk, with all kinds of colors, all produced by Japan, the United States, Britain, France, and other countries. I hardly saw any Chinese silk. When I asked the merchants of K.HSSARACO, they showed me two pieces of Chinese Huasi Ge and yellow silk. They said that the color was not durable and the quality was not strong. It would be damaged in one year, which was not as good as French silk, which could be used for three years. The silk from Japan and other countries is brightly colored and does not fade. Recently, the locals do not like to use Chinese silk. For this reason, there have been cases where customers bought silk in the store and returned it because it faded, so merchants do not sell Chinese silk. This situation is because our country's silk weaving factories and merchants lack research knowledge, which leads to commercial failure. Since India does not produce much silk and the Indian people do not use British goods, they cannot help but welcome the products of other countries. Our country is famous for its silk. If we can find a way to improve exports, we can recover our rights and interests. It is recommended that your department secretly consult the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which will inform the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Silk Industry Association, or factories, as well as the Cloth Industry Association, to dispatch experts to India for on-site investigation and improvement methods in order to develop industry and commerce and benefit foreign trade. This is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang.</p>
<p>Public Letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Dear Sirs, on the 18th of this month, we received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that a confidential report from the Consulate General in Calcutta had been approved and forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The proposed points were quite insightful. It is now a good opportunity for our country to develop foreign trade because the Indians are resisting British goods. In addition to sending separate letters of forwarding and reply, we are sending a copy of the original attachment for your information and for the information of the silk and cloth industries. Enclosed is a copy of the attachment. India's population is around 300 million, which is a very large market for sales. After the implementation of the boycott of British goods, it is an even better opportunity for the promotion of Chinese goods. However, it is necessary to conduct on-site investigations to determine which silk and cloth products suit Indian tastes in order to cater to current fashion. In accordance with the instructions, we are copying the original document and sending it to your association, requesting that you convene your colleagues to discuss it. If you can dispatch specialists to investigate and bring samples of durable quality to contact them, the manufacturers will have a better grasp of how to imitate them in the future. Since there is a Chinese consulate in that area, the consulate can be entrusted with handling the contact and guidance after arriving in India. Sincerely yours, (Xin Shanghai News Agency).</p>
<h3 id="e121">Both Northern and Southern City Rice Merchants Provide Guarantees <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Approves Restoration to Original State</p>
<p>The number of Songjiang cargo ships arriving in the southern city with rice is not large, and they must be unloaded as soon as they arrive. Recently, because the Social Affairs Bureau registered and evaluated the rice, the rice merchants' associations agreed that this method of the Social Affairs Bureau was only to eliminate premium prices. If they could resolve to abide by the price limit and no longer disrupt it, there would be no need for evaluation. Each merchant provided a guarantee on the spot that they would not disrupt the price limit, and if they violated it, they would be willing to accept a fine of more than 1,000 yuan to be used for subsidized rice expenses. Zhu Zixiang was publicly elected to submit the report to the Social Affairs Bureau, and the bureau approved it yesterday, exempting them from evaluation and unloading. However, they should still follow the registration, and the chairman of the association, Zhu Zixiang, should be responsible for investigating and not showing favoritism or covering up. If there is any disruption and it is not reported, once the Social Affairs Bureau finds out, the penalty will be doubled. It is said that Zhu has informed the merchants, and the rice from the Northern and Changbang gangs will still be handled as before.</p>
<p>The rice merchants in the northern city convened a meeting of their colleagues the day before yesterday, chaired by Jiang Zisheng, who explained the difficulties. Only if the colleagues no longer disrupted the price limit could it be lifted. After a long discussion, they dispersed late at night. It is said that they decided to follow the method of the cargo ship rice merchants' association, with each merchant providing a guarantee with a seal that they would no longer disrupt the price limit of 21 yuan, and if they violated it, they would be willing to accept a fine of 1,000 yuan. Jiang Zisheng and Fu Qiangeng were publicly elected to submit the report to the Social Affairs Bureau. Last night, the North City Office received a reply, which roughly stated, "The rice industry in the northern city has disregarded orders and disrupted the price limit, and has repeatedly failed to correct its behavior despite warnings. For the sake of the food for the entire city, the bureau has no choice but to take decisive measures. Now that the rice merchants have been able to repent of their past mistakes and strictly abide by the orders, and have obtained guarantees that they will no longer disrupt the price limit, and are willing to accept a fine of 1,000 yuan for any secret premium prices, they are provisionally allowed to register the incoming rice ships with the registration office of the bureau from the 20th of this month, and the merchants will sign samples for evaluation and sale. The association must still be responsible for investigating and the merchants must supervise each other, and must not condone or cover up. If there are any acts of disrupting the price limit and they are not reported, in addition to doubling the amount of the fine according to the guarantee, the association and the merchants who jointly signed the guarantee will be held accountable. Please inform everyone to abide by this."</p>
<h3 id="e122">Provincial Committee to Inspect the Sea Dike in Baoshan <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Baoshan Sea Dike was damaged for hundreds of zhang after being hit by a hurricane and storm surge, and it is about to collapse. Wang Yizhong, director of the Jiangnan Dike Engineering Office, telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that funds be allocated quickly for emergency repairs. This was recorded in the previous report. It is now learned that Director Wang received a reply telegram from the Provincial Construction Department yesterday, stating that Pei Zhenrong had been appointed to Baoshan to inspect the dangerous situation of the project on the ground so that he could consult the Finance Department and allocate funds for emergency repairs. According to the authorities of the office, the Baoshan Sea Dike was built in the eleventh year of the Qing Dynasty Yongzheng period. At that time, Hu Renji, the county magistrate of the county, used his private family property to build it. Later generations were grateful for his virtue and erected a shrine to commemorate him. However, for hundreds of years since then, it has never been thoroughly repaired and is in a dilapidated state. If it collapses once, the surrounding counties may become a swamp. The danger can be imagined. The total length of the sea dike is more than 1,300 zhang, from Wusong Paotai Bay to Lion Grove. The most recent damage is in the area north of Wuyue Dunshi, about 400 zhang, which requires 140,000 yuan. If the entire dike is to be repaired, it will require more than 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Money Industry Association Decides on Two Important Cases <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Plan to Seek Safety Due to Lack of Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Plan to Prepare Early for Year-End Closing</p>
<p>The North City Money Industry Association proposed two important cases to regulate finance and seek safety. They were decided at a meeting the day before yesterday. The full text of the proposals and the details of the decisions are recorded below. (1) Shanghai is a major port for international trade. All transactions with foreign merchants, including the prices of goods entering and leaving, are settled in taels first. In the past, the price of taels fluctuated according to the price of large bars, but now it is the opposite. This is because the import and export of various goods cannot offset each other, resulting in this phenomenon. In Shanghai, silver dollars are circulated in addition to standard silver, and the Shanghai Mint is actively proceeding with silver dollar minting. The raw materials depend on large bars. It is found that the import of large bars has been very small recently. According to the newspapers, the number of commonly used silver dollars shipped to other ports is also not small. Judging from the current situation, the silver dollars circulating in the market are not very abundant. There are two reasons for this: (a) because of the needs of various ports, shipments continue; (b) because various banks store more cash in preparation. It is conceivable that silver dollars circulating in the market are not very abundant because of these two reasons. What is even more worrying is that large bars do not come, and silver dollars are decreasing day by day. If the export of goods remains sluggish, foreign merchants and banks will inevitably ship precious silver to foreign countries to offset the taels owed. Even if the Shanghai Mint can start smelting and casting immediately, there is a risk of a lack of raw materials. The autumn harvest has not yet begun, and the demand for silver dollars is not very urgent, but the price of foreign currency has already risen so much, and the situation is so dangerous. The anxieties are extreme. Our colleagues in the financial industry are the first to bear the brunt if there is a risk in the financial industry. We should discuss how to seek safety in advance. This is the first case. (2) Change to the National Calendar. Our colleagues have long followed the business community in closing accounts at the end of each year, except for pre-ordered long-term accounts. All receivables and payables must be cleared at this time so that the final settlement can be performed to determine the profit and loss of the year. At the end of last year, because of the change to the National Calendar, preparations were not completed in time, and the government approved a one-month extension. Now that the National Calendar has been changed, the year-end closing will naturally be handled at the end of the National Calendar year, without any doubt. However, many merchants in the interior still use the abolished calendar. Shanghai is a commercial hub, and the money industry has the responsibility of financial circulation. Usually, whether cash or goods are released to various industries, they must be passed from A to B to C, and so on. By the end of the year, C pays to B, and B returns to A, and the final result is in the financial industry. If the year-end closing of the National Calendar this year cannot be completed on schedule due to the habits of various places, our colleagues will face a great danger. We should discuss how to seek safety in advance. This is the second case. After much discussion on the above two cases, in order to reduce the risk for our colleagues, the only way is to reduce the amount of loans at any time. However, reducing the amount of loans will inevitably affect various industries, which is not a good policy. After careful consideration, the first case should request the government to make overall plans as soon as possible to ensure that the supply and demand of silver dollar raw materials are equal, so that there will be no fear of financial panic and the market can be stable. For the second case, although the year-end closing of the National Calendar is still far away, we must plan ahead. It is natural to close accounts at the end of the National Calendar year. Our colleagues should publish notices in newspapers in advance and send letters to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to notify the national business community to uniformly use the National Calendar, so that there will be no excuses at the year-end closing of the National Calendar. This is the most complete plan for the National Calendar to be implemented in the commercial community without facing dangerous situations.</p>
<h3 id="e124">News of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>After the motor transport department joined the strike at the French Concession Tram Company, the labor unrest further expanded. Yesterday morning, more people voluntarily joined the strike by driving and selling tickets. The details of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tram Service Suspended in the Afternoon: Yesterday morning, after the motor transport department joined the strike at the French Concession Tram Company, trams on all routes, such as Routes 10, 7, 8, and 3, and trackless trams, were completely cut off. Four trams on Routes 2 and 10 were dispatched yesterday morning, but because no one took over the shift in the afternoon, they successively entered the factory to hand over their shifts, and then stopped.</p>
<p>Trade Union Holds Discussion Meeting: Yesterday afternoon, the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union held another discussion meeting. Xu Amei reported that the British Concession Water and Fire Company Workers' Union had sent a letter to the French Concession Workers' Union, expressing its willingness to provide practical assistance, and that the union would ask the employers to send a letter to the French Concession Electricity Company employers to mediate on their behalf, otherwise they would provide practical assistance for a week.</p>
<p>Workers Discuss Conditions: Yesterday, the motor transport workers held a meeting at the union to discuss conditions, such as fines and unwarranted suspensions. However, because there were not enough people, a decision could not be made. It is expected that another meeting will be held today to discuss and submit the issue to the company for negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e125">French Concession Tram Ticket Seller Severely Beaten Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Company Decides to Suspend All Services Today</p>
<p>At 6:15 yesterday morning, Tram No. 111 on French Route 2, which runs from Xujiahui to the Sixteen Pups, was just starting from the Lujiabang Depot when it arrived at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Luban. Dozens of people resembling workers were ambushed there in advance, each with iron bars and stones hidden on their bodies. At a signal, they rushed forward, first throwing stones at the tram, and then dragging the driver and three ticket sellers out of the tram and beating them with bars. The detectives who were guarding the tram nearby rushed to the scene and arrested four people on the spot. The three beaten men were seriously injured and groaned on the ground. It is estimated that the waist of ticket seller No. 179 was the most severely injured, and his life was in danger. Ticket seller No. 114 was injured in the head, but it was not a problem. The driver of Tram No. 169 was only slightly injured. The detectives first sent the injured to Guangci Hospital and then escorted the four arrested people to the police station to be detained separately for questioning by the French Concession Public Court. It is said that only six trams were dispatched from the depot yesterday morning, and Tram No. 111 was the second to be dispatched. By 5:40 in the evening, all services had been completely suspended. It is said that the company authorities have decided to suspend all services today.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Establishment of the National Coal Production and Sales Association <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Election of Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the National Coal Production and Sales Association of the Republic of China was held yesterday at 2:00 PM at the National Federation of Commerce venue. Representatives from the Municipal Government, including Zhu Wei Yao, Lin Kang Hou from the National Federation of Commerce, Jin Sheng Bai from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, along with Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xinfu, Yu Shunqing, Wang Jie'an (represented by Xu Genghua), Wu Keqiang, Chuan Ruiquan, Xu Kesheng, Chen Zhiying, and over a hundred coal merchant representatives, attended the meeting. After the meeting commenced, Lin Kang Hou was publicly elected as chairman, Feng Huimin as master of ceremonies, and Lin Shanqiu as recorder. Following the ceremonial procedures, the chairman delivered an opening address, stating, in essence, that the establishment of the National Coal Production and Sales Association marks the beginning of a revitalized coal industry. In recent years, domestic industries have suffered due to the impact of war. Although there are genuine domestic goods, transportation has been hindered, preventing their distribution. Our country is rich in coal resources, but due to the aforementioned reasons, we can only passively watch foreign coal dominate the market. We can only hope that the war ends soon, allowing all industries to gradually recover. When transportation is no longer obstructed, domestic coal can be transported both domestically and internationally, and patriotic citizens can purchase and use it as much as possible. Following this, Mr. Yu Shunqing, who had been preparing for the association for over a year, rose to speak, saying, "The more civilized the world becomes, the more intense the competition for survival becomes. This is a principle of natural selection that has been consistent throughout history. The key to survival is economics, which is crucial to the security of a nation and the success or failure of an individual. Therefore, there are economic scholars in ancient times and economic departments today, dedicated to studying and debating economics. How important is the application of economics! Since the opening of our country to foreign trade, customs have become increasingly extravagant, and habits have become indulgent, leading to the market being dominated by foreigners. The outflow of money is unknown to be in the tens of millions. However, our people are unaware and willingly become the prey, resulting in the impoverishment of the people and the exhaustion of wealth. If this continues, the country will cease to exist. As citizens, we have a responsibility for the prosperity of our nation and are concerned day and night. Therefore, starting in 1923, I engaged in the investigation of a portion of coal-related matters. The investigation revealed that our country loses as much as 200 million yuan annually in the coal industry. As a result, I vowed to write and promote my views on domestic coal, hoping to awaken the people. However, my individual efforts are insufficient, and success cannot be achieved without collective effort. Therefore, I gathered like-minded individuals to establish this association. I am grateful to Mr. Lin Kang Hou of the National Federation of Commerce for his support and for sending telegrams on behalf of the association to various departments of the National Government, provincial governments, and chambers of commerce. The National Government also issued an order to promote the association. Therefore, the reputation of this association should be attributed to Mr. Lin. This is the history of my involvement in the establishment and preparation of this association."</p>
<p>Following this, representatives from the Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered speeches. Subsequently, executive and supervisory committee members were elected. The executive committee members are Lin Kang Hou, Yu Shunqing, Xu Wusun, Liu Yumen, Zhang Xinfu, Wu Keqiang, Zhou Yan, Zhang Zujie, Xu Kesheng, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Tieqiao, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Bogang, Wang Xiaolai, and Sheng Pihua, with alternates Xie Luxi, Chen Ganqing, Shao Zhizhan, Lin Qinxiang, and Chen Shuntong. The supervisory committee members are Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Duanfu, Tu Diaoyun, Chen Zhiying, Zhao Jinqing, Li Zushen, and Gu Xinyi, with alternates Su Biting, Shen Zhongyi, and Jiang Chunchun. The meeting adjourned after a photograph was taken.</p>

<p>More Than 20,000 Men and Women Attended</p>
<p>The China National Products United Marketplace, after holding its opening ceremony a few days ago, immediately began reviewing the products from various factories. The review was completed the night before, and the marketplace officially opened for business yesterday at 9:00 AM. At around 9:00 AM, representatives from various factories, all staff members of the marketplace, and all committee members and advisors lined up in the main hall. Led by Manager Zhang Zilian, they marched to the main entrance of the marketplace, where Zhang Zilian performed the key-opening ceremony, unlocking the main gate of the hall. Then, they entered in an orderly fashion. At that moment, military music, firecrackers, and applause resounded in harmony, audible for several miles. The publicity department also dispatched personnel to distribute promotional leaflets from the upper floors, creating a magnificent scene with colorful red and green papers. After the ceremony, each merchant stall began its business operations. From morning till dusk, there were tens of thousands of men and women visiting and shopping at the marketplace. Each merchant's stall was splendidly decorated and offered affordable prices, resulting in thriving business. It is estimated that the total sales for the day amounted to over 44,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Both Railways Still Selling Tianjin-Pukou Joint Tickets <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Sales Have Not Actually Been Suspended</p>
<p>Regarding the news reported yesterday that the two railways had temporarily suspended the sale of Tianjin-Pukou Railway joint passenger tickets, we received letters yesterday from Mr. Liu Chengchang, Director of the Traffic Department, and Mr. Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director, stating that the joint ticket sales for the two railways were approved by the Railway Department's Joint Transportation Office on the 18th of this month. Due to the insufficient number of passenger cars on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the sale of joint tickets was temporarily suspended. However, on the afternoon of the same day, another telegram was received from the Joint Transportation Office stating that Tianjin-Pukou joint transportation would resume to Yanzhou from that day onward. The Traffic Department immediately telegraphed all related stations to comply. Therefore, in fact, joint transportation has not been suspended, and this correction is being made.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Ministry of Finance's Order Urging the Financial Bureau to Remit Funds is Inaccurate <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the news reported on the 18th about the Ministry of Finance ordering the Municipal Finance Bureau to remit funds, a key official from the Finance Bureau stated that the bureau's monthly income consists of local tax revenues and does not include national tax funds. Therefore, the funds are used locally according to the budget. Not only has the bureau never remitted funds to the Ministry of Finance, but the Ministry of Finance has also never ordered the bureau to remit funds. This news is not only untrue but also erroneous and is likely motivated by other purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wages for Holidays Commemorating the Revolution <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Should Be Paid in Accordance with the Law</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Issues a Notice to All Businesses</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, due to the fact that some Chinese-owned yarn factories in the city have not been paying their workers for holidays commemorating the revolution, which violates national laws, has presented a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to issue a notice to all Chinese and foreign-owned businesses to comply with the payment of wages. The government issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of the notification, the dates of official holidays for workers in the city have been approved by the Executive Yuan and announced. It has been found that the majority of businesses in the city pay their workers during the legally designated revolutionary holidays, but there are still many that do not. This situation is not equitable and violates national laws. Therefore, compliance should be uniform to avoid bias and prevent excuses. The Social Affairs Bureau has requested that a notice be issued, which is hereby approved. All businesses in the city are hereby notified to comply. It should be known that since the holidays commemorating the revolution have been stipulated, workers should be paid for their holidays, and no one should violate this, so as not to cause inconvenience. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Both Labor and Management Should Abide by the Law <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Separate Orders Issued by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolution of the previous representatives' assembly, submitted a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the labor force to jointly abide by the Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes. It also cited the incident of the Chamber of Commerce's donation collection personnel being assaulted on the road as a violation of human rights and requested a reaffirmation of government orders. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau immediately issued instructions, stating: "The request has been noted. Since the Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes was promulgated by the National Government and announced by this bureau in Notice No. 133, both labor and management must strictly comply. There is no need for further notification. However, in reality, both labor and management sometimes deliberately violate the law. This is because their prejudices against each other are too deep. Once a dispute arises, they become emotional and exceed the boundaries of normal behavior. In addition to issuing a general order to all labor unions in the city to sternly warn them, you must also instruct the employers of each industry to comply, eliminate prejudices, and abide by the law. Only then can labor and management understand each other and resolve disputes. As for the protection of human rights, the law is in place. If the alleged assault on the donation collection personnel of the Chamber of Commerce is true, a criminal lawsuit can be filed with the judicial authorities in accordance with the law. The request for reaffirmation is beyond the scope of this bureau's authority and will not be considered." This instruction was also issued to all labor unions, stating: "Regarding the matter of complying with orders, the law stipulates that people cannot be exempt from responsibility because they are unaware of the law. However, since the promulgation and implementation of the regulations related to the labor union's handling of labor disputes, both labor and management have often violated the regulations. Regardless of whether their actions are intentional or unintentional, they are still violations of the law. Supporting labor is one of the main policies of our party. We are reluctant to punish without teaching, but condoning and relaxing the law would not be fair. Therefore, you are hereby ordered to comply, constantly educate the workers, and be cautious not to test the law. Do not be negligent. This order is hereby issued."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Recent Statistics on Vaccination by the Health Bureau <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>More Than 260,000 People Have Benefited</p>
<p>This year, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's cholera prevention efforts have been expanded compared to previous years. The Propaganda Committee promotes and urges vaccinations, and the Vaccination Teams implement the vaccinations. This has awakened the public's belief in epidemic prevention. In previous years, the number of people vaccinated against cholera was around 150,000, but this year, from May 1st to July 15th, it has reached 266,361, and it is still being promoted. This vaccination work is a pioneering effort in our country. Even in countries with earlier public health development, it was not easy to achieve this result when first implementing vaccination. According to people in the bureau, if the concession areas could jointly implement widespread vaccination, the cholera epidemic that Shanghai dreads every year could be eliminated, and the number of citizens dying from cholera would be greatly reduced. However, due to various practical constraints, disease statistics have not yet been fully compiled. Therefore, the effectiveness of this prevention work is difficult to express in numbers. However, the principle of health administration is to eliminate problems before they arise. The bureau's only hope is that citizens will abandon their prejudices, accept vaccination, and make it as widespread as possible. It is hoped that people from all walks of life with higher awareness will assist and guide them to accept vaccination.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Petition of the Western Paint Association <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Western Paint Industry Association, the Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association, the Qinglan Dyeing Industry Union, etc., submitted a document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that non-member businesses should jointly abide by the resolutions and approved rules of the industry association. The document stated that they jointly support the Municipal Market Industry Association's proposal that "the rules approved by the competent authorities for filing should be regarded as special regulations for the industry, and non-member businesses should also jointly abide by them." They requested that it be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan of the National Government and consulted with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption and implementation to protect industry and commerce and benefit the people. The letter was respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for review. It was stated that at the inaugural meeting of the Chamber of Commerce on the 21st of last month, the Municipal Market Industry Association, the Shoe Industry Association, the Flour Industry Association, and the preparatory committee of the Chinese and Foreign Department Store Association proposed the following: "(1) Merchants who have established an industry association, even if they have not joined the association, should abide by the resolutions of the association. If they violate the resolutions, the association may file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. (2) The rules submitted by various industry associations to the competent government authorities for approval should be regarded as regulations promulgated by the government and have a very precise legal status. Non-member businesses should also be subject to sanctions. (3) There are many violations of the approved rules. How to remedy this should be discussed." The Chamber of Commerce believes that the effectiveness of the resolutions of the industry association cannot extend to merchants who have not joined the association. However, the rules jointly formulated by each industry are originally intended to protect business and regulate operations. They must also be submitted to the competent government authorities for record filing. If there is a risk of bias or monopoly, they will not be approved by the government. After this approval process, their nature is different from the individual decisions of the association and similar to the regulations specially formulated by the government for each industry. It seems that both member and non-member businesses should be bound by them. Otherwise, members must fulfill various obligations and consider the public interest, and be subject to the restrictions of the rules. Non-members can freely expand their private interests. Inevitably, members will regret joining, and the group will disintegrate. It is also feared that cunning people will rely on having joined to control the industry on the one hand, and use capital to open stores and arbitrarily expand their private interests on the other hand. The consequences are unimaginable. This situation has been discovered repeatedly by the various industry associations in the city. The original proposal of the Municipal Market Industry Association is not without insight. Therefore, based on the above opinions, the proposal was combined and submitted to the Chamber of Commerce for resolution at the general meeting. It was stated that the above proposal is a clear and firm plan for the various industry associations in the city to resolve their troubles. With unanimous agreement, the associations jointly support the above proposal and jointly submit it to the Chamber of Commerce for review. It is requested that it be promptly forwarded to the Legislative Yuan of the National Government and consulted with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption and implementation to protect industry and commerce and benefit the people. The letter was respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e136">A Record of the Grand Gathering Yesterday to Welcome Mei Lanfang <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Ancient Music of the Datong Music Society Was Pleasing to the Ear</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's Reply Was Very Humble</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day after Mei Lanfang's return from the New World. Celebrities from the sea and leaders from various industries gathered at the Great China Hotel to welcome him. The guests and hosts sweated and conversed, which was also a pleasant event in the sweltering heat. Mr. Mei had been abroad for half a year and was highly acclaimed overseas. Although yesterday's welcome tea party was also a kind of social gathering, it was the first time Mr. Mei met with people from all walks of life after his long journey and return to his country. The general situation of the grand meeting is recorded as follows to inform the readers.</p>
<p>The venue for the return of the guest from the New World was set in the Italian Garden of the Great China Hotel, accompanied by the ancient music of the Datong Music Society. Guests who came to the place felt the wonder of the intermingling of Chinese and Western cultures. In addition to the 44 hosts mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, Chinese and Western guests were gathered together, and some brought their families with them. There was a mix of shoes and clothing, and the shadows of hair and the fragrance of clothing. Mr. Mei's popularity can be said to be complete. After the guests were assembled, Mr. Mei entered the venue and nodded to greet each of them. He was wearing a black gown and white shirt, and his demeanor was relaxed. He held a paper folding fan in his hand. He exchanged pleasantries with the guests briefly. The talk and manners of the returning guest from the New World in the minds of the people were still the same as before.</p>
<p>Li Shizeng's Speech Zheng Qinwen, the conductor of the Datong Music Society, led the members to play five chapters of national music. The sound of the zither, pipa, bells, and drums resonated, and the guests all tapped their feet and praised. After the music stopped, applause rang like thunder. Then, Chairman Li Shizeng stood up. The chairman of yesterday's welcome meeting was originally Mayor Zhang, but Zhang was unable to attend. Mr. Li began by explaining this. Next, he said that Mr. Mei's success on this trip was the success of Chinese drama, and it was also the realization of the intermingling of Chinese and Western cultures. However, he also elaborated that the elements of opera, including art education, are not trivial. Chinese drama, even without seeking publicity abroad, has its own considerable value. The same is true for Western drama. There is no need to go to extremes. One can learn from the strengths of others and make up for one's own shortcomings. Finally, he said that Mr. Mei's return on this trip will give a new life to Chinese opera. He hoped that Mr. Mei would work hard. His speech was translated into English by Mr. Xie Fusheng, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing also gave a speech on the spot, expressing his admiration for Mr. Mei.</p>
<p>Hu Shi's Speech Dr. Hu Shi spoke after Mr. Yu, saying that Mei Lanfang's success was the success of Mr. Mei himself. As for the issue of Chinese drama, it should be discussed separately. Dr. Hu further said that Mr. Mei's success was due to his personal cultivation. If it were someone else, it would not be certain whether they could return with this reputation. Finally, he said that before returning to China, Mei Lanfang wrote to friends in Shanghai, stating that he felt more and more ashamed as he was welcomed and praised everywhere. He asked, "What ability do I have to receive this excessive praise? In the future, I must study the path of drama more and put in more effort." The doctor said that just from this, it can be seen that Mr. Mei is humble and his success is not accidental. As for the mutual help of Mr. Mei's friends, it is not just for Mr. Mei alone. Ye Gongchuo was the last person to speak in the speech, and he added to Dr. Hu Shi's "Mr. Mei's personal success," saying that Mr. Mei's success in the United States need not be said. What is especially important is that Mr. Mei introduced Chinese drama to foreigners, allowing them to know the truth about Chinese drama and avoid vague guesses. Before Mr. Mei set out, his colleagues predicted that his success could be expected. Now it is indeed the case. It is also enough to see that Mr. Mei's artistic achievements have surpassed others.</p>
<p>Li Shizeng and Mei Lanfang at the Welcome Dinner</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's Reply Amid the applause of the people, Mei Lanfang stood up to give his reply, speaking in extremely pure Mandarin, with each word clearly and distinctly, which the listeners could hear clearly. His words were as follows: "Lanfang is able to realize his dream of going to the United States thanks to the encouragement of the gentlemen and the advocacy of the Beijing Opera Academy. This trip has already been half a year. Lanfang's purpose in going to the United States was for my own learning, knowledge, and skills, because I have always lacked a foundation and lacked research. Therefore, I wanted to go out and see what other people have to offer, or perhaps I could gain some benefit. After arriving in New York, I originally wanted to go and study first, but all parties hoped that I could perform first. Therefore, I decided to perform for two weeks. As a result, I performed for five weeks. New York's reviews of our Chinese opera were very good. The newspapers often had records of our opera. They all praised the depth and mystery of our Chinese culture. Therefore, other places sent letters and people inviting me to perform. Some places, because of time and arrangement issues, were not convenient, so I only went to a few big places. From New York, I went to Chicago, where I performed for ten days, and then to San Francisco, where I performed for two weeks. Then I went to Los Angeles. Los Angeles is very close to Hollywood. I performed for ten days in Los Angeles. Then we went to Honolulu. The overseas Chinese there have a very strong interest in the motherland. Therefore, the results everywhere were very good. The above paragraph proves that this trip was really too busy because of the performances, and I can't say anything about the research aspect. If someone were to ask me about American drama, I'm afraid I would still have to ask others. As for the reputation I gained from performing, that is even less worth mentioning, because what I performed is only one genre, and I always feel that it is not up to the meaning of art. Now that I think back, before Lanfang set out, I received the strong support of all the gentlemen. After arriving in the United States, the Americans gave me very good reviews, and many overseas Chinese were also very enthusiastic. In Lanfang's view, this is not just a small personal honor, and even a small success in Chinese drama is a small matter. Perhaps there are still larger relationships involved. When Lanfang went out, I was often very apprehensive. Today, I am very ashamed that all the gentlemen have opened such a grand gathering. After returning this time, Lanfang feels even more that my knowledge is shallow, but I will never dare to fail the kindness and expectations of all the gentlemen. From now on, I will prepare to work hard and research drama. If there is an opportunity, I want to go out again to see the progress of others. Therefore, I have this determination to repay all the gentlemen and the overseas Chinese in the United States for their kindness to me."</p>
<h3 id="e137">The U.S. Minister Has Absolutely Not Apologized for the "UnAfraid of Death" Film <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The claim that it was destroyed is unfounded</p>
<p>Rock has not sent a telegram of apology either</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, according to Chinese newspapers, U.S. Minister Johnson has apologized to the Chinese people for the "UnAfraid of Death" film and ordered the film to be destroyed. This statement is completely unfounded. Minister Johnson is currently residing in Shanghai and has not taken any such action. The previous report in the Chinese newspapers that Rock sent a telegram of apology is also untrue. Rock only sent a telegram saying that the film made some Chinese people in Shanghai unable to satisfy them, and he was very sorry.</p>

<p>240 Miles Across</p>
<p>Appears to be Heading Towards China</p>
<p>The second hurricane has already crossed Japan to the north. Yesterday morning, it reached the Korean peninsula and made landfall. It continues to the north and will head towards the northeast provinces. The force is very strong, and the spread is wide. The losses along the way are estimated to be unrecoverable. Yesterday at 4:00 PM, the Yangjingbang Observatory reported that a new hurricane had been discovered in the Pacific Ocean. It has already blown to longitude 142 degrees and latitude 11 degrees, located in the extreme east of the Philippine Islands. Its spread is wider than the first two, with the center point spanning 240 miles, or about 720 Chinese miles. It is currently blowing to the northwest and appears to be heading towards China. However, the trend is constantly changing, so its whereabouts cannot be determined for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Chen Xiaoyu Was Kidnapped on Avenue Road Last Night <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Chen Intended to Drive to See His Concubine</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Encountered Danger When Leaving Home</p>
<p>Gunshots Frightened Away an Old Woman</p>
<p>The Car Is Still Missing</p>
<p>At around 8:00 PM yesterday, Chen Xiaoyu, who lives at No. 1361, the corner of Avenue Road and Hart Road, was suddenly kidnapped by four bandits in front of his house. Chen's own car, No. 4702, was also driven away by the bandits and has disappeared. The details of the kidnapping are as follows:</p>
<p>Family Situation Chen Xiaoyu is 33 years old and from Fujian. His grandfather, Chen Quanru, once served as the Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, and his family had a reputation in the officialdom. The Chen family has lived in Shanghai for many years. They currently reside at No. 1361 Avenue Road, living comfortably and not engaged in production. It is said that Chen once made a bet on gold transactions last year, resulting in a huge loss of assets.</p>
<p>Bandits Lay in Wait Chen has a six-cylinder Buick sedan, with rental concession license plate number 4702, driven by a driver, Lu Guisheng, from Suzhou. Chen has a concubine and built a golden house in the Yongning Village on Foch Road in the French Concession. At around 8:00 PM last night, Chen planned to drive there. He walked out of the house with his driver, Lu Guisheng. Unexpectedly, four bandits were lying in wait in front of the door.</p>
<p>Disguised as Vendors The four bandits disguised themselves as vendors selling melons, peanuts, and other snacks. They lingered in front of Chen's house for a long time. When they saw Chen and the others leaving the house and approaching the car, they swarmed forward. Two bandits kidnapped Chen into the car. One bandit was responsible for driving, and one bandit pushed the driver, Lu Guisheng, out of the car. At that time, the front of the car was facing north, and it drove all the way towards Jing'an Temple and disappeared. A Shot in the Air The house opposite Chen's is a broker shop. An old woman in the shop saw the four bandits wrestling with Chen and Lu. Thinking it was a normal fight, she hurried over to mediate. At this time, the bandits had already succeeded and pushed Lu Guisheng down. Seeing the old woman approaching breathlessly, thinking that she had malicious intentions, they quickly took out a pistol and fired a shot in the air. With a loud bang, the car had already started, and the old woman was also frightened away.</p>
<p>Interrogation of the Driver After being pushed down by the bandits, Lu Guisheng stood there for a while. Seeing that his master had been kidnapped, he returned home to report. Soon, the detectives arrived and took Lu to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station for interrogation. The police are tracking the car that was robbed, but it has not yet been found.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Huang Yuyi Escapes Danger <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, He Took a Steamer to Southeast Asia for Recuperation</p>
<p>Huang Yuyi, the assistant manager of the Zhongnan Bank, was kidnapped by bandits on Haig Road at 6:30 PM on May 27th. For over a month, there was no news. Huang suddenly returned home safely at around 1:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 18th). It is reported that after Huang was kidnapped, he was hidden in a small house near Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai. At around 6:00 PM on the 17th, Huang took advantage of the guards relaxing in the cool air and escaped through the door. Two bandits saw him and immediately chased after him with guns. They were only about ten steps away. The bandits fired two shots at Huang. Huang fell to the ground in panic and did not dare to move. It was sunset, and there were many pedestrians in the fields. The bandits saw Huang fall to the ground and not move, so they stopped chasing him. After a short while, Huang saw that the bandits had disappeared, so he got up and fled for his life. After walking for about half an hour, he arrived near the back of Jiaotong University. Because there was a small stream in the way, he detoured to the front gate of the university, intending to borrow a telephone and hire a car to return home. However, Huang had just escaped from the bandits' den, his hair was long, his face was dirty, and he was still wearing a lined robe, looking very miserable, and he could not communicate, so he was prevented from entering by the gatekeeper of the university. Helpless, he hired a rickshaw to</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>search for his own residence in the French Concession. Because he could not communicate and was not familiar with the roads, he wandered around various roads for more than four or five hours, changing rickshaws three times before finally arriving home. His family was overjoyed to see him. Huang stayed in the bandits' den for fifty-two days, but his spirit was still good. Yesterday, he took a steamer to Southeast Asia for a long period of recuperation.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Qiu Jianfei Escapes Danger <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Planning an Escape from the Bandits' Den</p>
<p>Yesterday, He Went to Suzhou and Wuxi for Relaxation</p>
<p>Qiu Jianfei, a famous amateur actor, was kidnapped near the Grand Stage on Hankou Road at around 1:00 AM on the 5th of this month while returning home after watching a play. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Half a month has passed, and now we learn that Qiu suddenly escaped from the bandits' den at 11:00 PM the night before last. Upon hearing the news, this newspaper's reporter went to Qiu's residence to inquire about the details. Mr. Zhang, a friend of Qiu, received him and said that after Qiu was kidnapped, the bandits directly hid him in a small boat in a canal. There were three or four bandits waiting in the boat. At that time, Qiu was too frightened and could not recognize the address, but he guessed that it was probably in the Riyue Bridge area in western Shanghai. After boarding the boat, he was locked in a narrow cabin. The temperature was very high and suffocating. The bandits all spoke with a northern accent, in groups of three to five, taking turns guarding with guns. Although Mr. Qiu repeatedly begged for a little ventilation, he had to wait until late at night and could only sit briefly at the bow of the boat before being asked to return to the cabin, as if he were a criminal in prison. At first, the bandits suspected that Qiu was a young master of the Qiu Tianbao Silver Shop. After the explanation was made clear, the bandits appeared quite frustrated. Until the night before last, Qiu repeatedly asked the bandits to let him lie on the deck, saying that if they were not at ease, they could tie his hand to the guard's hand and sleep together. The bandits listened to him, smiled, and agreed. At that time, he slept with two bandits on the bow of the boat. At around 11:00 PM, both bandits were fast asleep, snoring loudly. Although Qiu had the intention to escape at that time, he was afraid that the bandits were pretending, and he saw that the boat was about seven or eight feet away from the shore. So he deliberately tossed and turned frequently. Seeing that the two bandits were snoring as usual, Mr. Qiu then firmly grasped the cable with one hand and gradually brought the boat closer to the shore. The two bandits still did not notice. At this time, Qiu used his martial arts skills, jumped ashore, and ran away quickly, turning from bay to bay to avoid the bandits' eyes. When he saw electric lights flashing and the road was flat, he knew that he had reached the concession. The road was unusually quiet, and vehicles were rarely seen. Just as he was anxious, he suddenly saw a car company sign in front of him. He looked closely and saw that it was the Huaxin Linji Car Company at 354 Rue de la Tour. He rushed in and told the cashier the truth. The cashier, surnamed Wang, listened to him and knew that he was the famous actor Qiu Jianfei who had been kidnapped. However, all the cars at that time had been rented out. He used the telephone to borrow one from another company and sent Qiu home. When he arrived home, it was already late at night. Qiu, because he had been imprisoned in the bandits' den for half a month, a suffering he had never experienced in his life, set off yesterday to Suzhou and Wuxi for relaxation.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Englishman Charles Killed by Cook <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>A Tragic Case of Murder for Money</p>
<p>Charles Lived in Luxury</p>
<p>The Cook Suddenly Had Evil Thoughts</p>
<p>He Entered the Room at Midnight with a Kitchen Knife</p>
<p>He Was Seriously Wounded and Eventually Died</p>
<p>Charles, an Englishman, 53 years old, worked at the Customs. He lived with his wife on the third floor of a Western-style house at 859 North Sichuan Road. A week ago, his wife left him to return to her country. Charles lived alone. However, Charles was quite wealthy and liked to dress up. He usually wore luxurious clothes. The diamond ring on his finger, the gold watch on his wrist, the dazzling light, and the brilliant colors were envied by those who saw them. His pocket was never empty. He often had piles of banknotes, vaguely visible outside his clothes, which aroused the greed of bandits. Charles' cook, Xue Cheng, a Cantonese, hired an assistant named Pan Zhi half a month ago, who was also from Guangdong. Pan saw that his master was covered in treasures. In addition to coveting them,</p>
<p>He Had Evil Intentions and Had Long Wanted to Rob Him. There was no opportunity to take advantage of. Recently, he learned that the master was sleeping alone at night, thinking that he should not miss this opportunity. So, at 1:00 AM yesterday, he sneaked into the kitchen and took a sharp kitchen knife, carried it upstairs, and broke into Charles' room. Charles woke up from his dream and, with sleepy eyes, caught sight of</p>
<p>a Shiny Steel Knife and shouted for help. But Pan had already rushed towards him and slashed him in the face. Charles resisted with his bare hands, resulting in two cuts on his shoulders and arms. Pan also panicked, threw the knife, and ran downstairs to hide. Charles then</p>
<p>Shouted from the Window. At this time, detectives Feng Qi and Zhang Yuting from the Hongkou Police Station heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. Because the gate of the house was tightly closed, they did not wait for it to be opened and jumped in from the window on the side of the gate. They first went upstairs and saw Charles</p>
<p>lying in a Pool of Blood. After inquiring about the details, they immediately reported to the police station by telephone and searched the house for the murderer. The detectives thought that all the doors were closed, and they guessed that the murderer might be hiding in the house. Later, they found Pan</p>
<p>standing in a Corner near the kitchen toilet, with blood stains on the soles of his feet. They arrested him. At this time, Chief Inspector Heller from the Hongkou Police Station had already sent Western police officer No. 139 to arrive by car. They took Charles to the Suzhou Road Public Hospital for treatment and took Pan back to the police station for questioning and strict detention. It was already six o'clock in the morning. The detectives, because Pan confessed at the police station to</p>
<p>Murdering for Money and also said that Xue Cheng was also an accomplice, went to that place again. Xue was still wandering on the second floor, looking thoughtful, and was arrested. Later, at 8:00 AM, they were sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge Zhitan sat in the third courtroom for interrogation. However, the victim, Charles, died at 3:20 PM at the Public Hospital because the blood vessels in the injured area had been severed, resulting in</p>
<p>Excessive Blood Loss. The police lawyer, Wei Yinde, went to the court, explaining the previous situation, stating that Charles had died from his injuries, the murder weapon was still in the custody of the police station, and there were various aspects of the case that needed to be investigated, requesting an extension of the trial. Then, Chinese and Western detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest of the two defendants and stated that the deceased's bedroom</p>
<p>Had Been Sealed. Judge Ge then interrogated Pan Zhi, who confessed that he had conspired with Xue Cheng beforehand, and with Xue's consent, he had carried a kitchen knife upstairs last night at midnight and broke into the master's bedroom. Xue also held</p>
<p>a Short-Handled Axe and followed me into the room to provide support. I attacked the master's arm twice and then jumped out of the window and fled. We harmed the master to steal his money, etc. According to Xue Cheng's confession, he lived at 27 Baoshan Road, Baotong Road, Zhabei. I am employed at Charles' residence. Every night at 7:15 PM, I have to go home to stay overnight and go to work at the employer's place at 5:30 AM the next morning. Two weeks ago, I was chatting with a friend at an insurance company. The friend recommended Pan Zhi as my assistant. Now that his case of murdering for money has been discovered,</p>
<p>He Is Falsely Accusing Me. I know nothing about this matter. Moreover, the deceased treated me very well. How could I do such an illegal thing? Therefore, Pan's confession, which involves me, is all fabricated. Before I returned home last night, I even bought</p>
<p>Two Eggs because the master needed them for breakfast. Now these two eggs are still in the vegetable basket in the kitchen. This morning, I went to the master's place from my home and first looked for Pan, but I couldn't find him, so I went to the second floor. At that time, the detectives arrived and arrested me, etc. Judge Ge ordered Pan and Xue to be taken back into custody and adjourned the hearing to another date. Because the case was important, he personally went to 859 North Sichuan Road, third floor, with the clerk, at 3:00 PM to investigate the scene. At that time, the police also brought Pan and Xue, and Judge Ge asked in detail about the</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Murder. After the inspection, he returned to the court, and Pan and Xue were taken back to the police station for custody by the police. As for Charles' remains, the police car took them to the Philanthropic Road morgue, reported to the British Consular Court, and a judge was specially dispatched to verify the identity and collect the remains.</p>
<p>Wenhui News reported that Charles Goddard, the deputy head of the foreign clerks of the Customs, was cut by a cook and died at the Public Hospital. This morning (19th), Anderson, the coroner of the British Consular Court, went to the hospital to examine the body. Bras, a Westerner from the Customs, testified that he had known the deceased for sixteen years and knew that he had no disputes over finances or family affairs before his death. The deceased had served in the Customs for twenty-five years and left a wife who is now in Hong Kong. After the interrogating officer finished asking, he ordered an extension of the hearing to next Saturday at the British Public Hall.</p>

<p>The Result of a Love Triangle</p>
<p>Two Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred in Tanziawan, Zhabei. The deceased was Li Zaocheng, the owner of the Tongxing Tea Garden in that area. The reason was jealousy and resentment, involving a love triangle. The circumstances were very complicated. The murderers, Shen Changgen and Fei Deji, fled without a trace after the incident. Only two suspects were arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Possessing a Beautiful and Charming Wife, Li Zaocheng (also known as Li Dazaozi), from Yancheng, is 31 years old and owns the Tongxing Tea Garden at 355 Caopeng, Tanziawan, Zhabei. The business is booming and can be called a small fortune. His brother, Decheng, is a rice shop runner. They live separately, renting houses in 16 Hengyu Lane, Hengfeng Road. Although they live in different places, they often visit each other. The brotherly relationship is very close. His wife, Zhao, maiden name Ayin, is 20 years old and has good looks. They have been married for less than half a year. The couple's love is as deep as the sea. Li cherishes her like a precious jewel. Who would have thought that Li's assassination was caused by this? If Li knew, he would not be able to rest in peace.</p>
<p>The Woman Had Two Lovers Before. Shen Changgen, who owns the Xiexing Land Goods Store, is already married. He used to be fond of Zhao and insisted on marrying her as a concubine. She secretly communicated with him and was very close, but she was unwilling to be a concubine and never agreed to marry him. Shen said that he must achieve his goal. She saw that he was stubborn and began to hate him. She abandoned him and fell in love with Fei Deji, leaving Shen behind. Unexpectedly, after a few months, her mother suddenly betrothed her to Li Zaocheng, and she married into the family in February of this year. From then on, her two lovers were unable to contact her.</p>
<p>The Thought of Revenge Arose. Although Shen and Fei were rejected by her, they still could not forget her. They often went to Li's teahouse to drink tea, but she ignored them. The two were filled with anger, and the thought of revenge arose. After discussing it for many days, they decided to kill her and her husband to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Unforeseen Bullet Flying over. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, Li and she were just enjoying their dreams when they suddenly heard a knock on the door. Li's employee, Yang Zhanyuan, got up and opened the door. Unexpectedly, three rough men suddenly broke in, saying that the boss was there. There were three more people guarding outside the door, looking around, looking very dangerous. When Yang heard this, he knew that the comers were not good people. One of them took out a pistol, forbidding him to make a sound. Yang saw the weapon and retreated to a corner, trembling. Then two people walked into the room. Li had already woken up and was about to go out to see, but an merciless bullet hit his head, and he fell down. The murderers knew that they had caused trouble and fled in all directions.</p>
<p>Zaocheng Died. When Zhao saw Zaocheng lying in a pool of blood, she touched him and found that he was dead. She was shocked and reported to the Tanziawan police station in the fourth district. She also ordered someone to inform her brother Li Decheng. Chief Shi led the police to search for them, but the murderers had long disappeared. He reported back to the headquarters and asked for their arrest.</p>
<p>Two Suspects were Arrested. Chief Jin, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Police Officer Gong to go with the investigators to arrest them. Two suspects, Hou Afu and Ruan Rusheng, were arrested and brought to the station. After questioning, they were detained for investigation. The corpse was inspected by Prosecutor Lei in the afternoon. It was determined that the cause of death was a gunshot wound. He ordered the family of the deceased to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Sent to the Public Security Bureau for Relief</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM yesterday, a middle-aged woman brought a four or five-year-old boy to the Pudong Lan Ni Du Pier and asked to sell him, saying that the price was only ten yuan. A large crowd gathered to watch. The patrolling police arrived at the scene and took the woman and the child to the Third District of the Public Security Bureau. The woman confessed that her name was Chen Li, 31 years old, from Lishui. Her husband was doing hat business in Ningbo, and there had been no news from home for a long time. So she went to Ningbo ten days ago to look for him, but she could not find him. She passed through Shanghai, and her travel expenses were exhausted. She had no choice but to sell her own five-year-old son, and there was no other reason. The district chief thought that selling children was against humanity and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for relief.</p>

<p>San Yi Lane on Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, has an artesian well to supply drinking water to the tenants. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has repeatedly urged improvement because of the unclean water quality and insufficient water volume. Recently, it was reported that the well has been short of water since summer, which is very inconvenient for the residents to drink. The bureau sent personnel to investigate on July 16. According to the residents, there is no water at all from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM every day, and the water flow is also slow at other times, especially in the south of the lane. The officer tried to open the faucet and found that no water flowed out. The bureau believes that drinking water is a daily necessity for human life and is especially urgent in this hot summer. It sent a letter to the owner, San Yi Company, the day before yesterday, ordering them to improve it within a time limit. If it is impossible to improve it, they should connect to the Zhabei tap water to improve hygiene.</p>

This was unanimously approved by the attendees. The company issued a total of 1.5 million taels of bonds. On that day, creditors with 624,000 taels of bonds attended.</p>

Unexpectedly, when traveling through the waters near Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, several boats resembling fishing boats suddenly came sailing from behind. Cheng Baoxing, the captain of the sand boat, saw that the situation was strange and knew that he had encountered robbers. At that time, the south wind was very strong, so he immediately instructed the crew to pull up the sails as much as possible, hoping to escape. However, the robber boats opened fire in the rear, knocking down the helmsman, and the boat was skewed and unstable. At this time, the robber boats had arrived and surrounded the Shunlongxing sand boat.

Yesterday, Xu was brought before the French court for prosecution. The plaintiff, Yang, detailed the previous events, stating that the stolen costumes were worth a total of 924 silver dollars, with over 190 silver dollars already pawned. He explained that he had hired the defendant as his assistant some years ago, and initially, everything was fine, so he trusted him. However, later, he became addicted to opium, and his earnings were insufficient to cover his expenses. As a result, he repeatedly stole costumes to pawn. At first, Yang was unaware, as Xu would pawn other costumes to redeem the ones needed for the day. Day after day, the debts grew, and eventually, he could no longer redeem the costumes and fled. Now that he has been apprehended, Yang requested a trial. Xu Chengfo confessed that he committed the crimes because Yang Huinong was ill and lacked funds, leaving him no choice but to resort to illegal actions and begged for leniency. Judge Zhu sentenced Xu to two months in the Western Jail as a warning, and the recovered costumes were returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper's local news column on the 18th that there were two "steelworks reform crucible" stories. The so-called reform plan did not fully match the facts, and also leading to the funding to purchase firebricks was not based on anything. As for the manufacture of bombs, the situation has been reported and has not yet been instructed to follow. Whether the plant is open or not, the plant is also unknown. I'm afraid it may confuse the rumors, so I have sent it to you, and I hope to make corrections to the Shuzhao Fact. Sincerely, Shanghai Steel Factory, July 19,</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>A news item, "The Ministry of Finance Orders the Municipal Finance Bureau to Release Funds" (this news item was submitted by the New Shanghai News Agency) was published in your newspaper's local news column. After reviewing the content, it was completely untrue. The various municipal taxes collected by our bureau are local revenue, and all are used for local expenditures, such as municipal administrative expenses and various construction projects, etc. There are budget regulations, and they are directly received and paid by the municipal treasury. It does not need to be handed over to the national treasury as an example. The Ministry of Finance mentioned in your newspaper has never received any such ministry order, and I don't know what it is based on. I am very surprised. I am afraid that rumors will confuse the audience. I would like to ask you to check and make corrections immediately. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, July 19,</p>

<h3 id="e171">Small Notes from the Melon Pot Studio Zhi Yuan <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The poem of the secluded wind says, "Eat melons in July, break gourds in August." July and August in the Zhou dynasty correspond to May and June in the summer. The weather is extremely hot. Avoid eating fishy and fatty foods. Dig bamboo shoots and cut vegetables. They have a special and refined taste. In the countryside, people gather under bean trellises and melon vines for evening talks. The sound of cicadas accompanies them, and fireflies seem to flow. It is a wonderful picture of escaping the summer heat.</p>
<p>Guang Ya lists dragon hooves, beast paws, variegated sheep, rabbit heads, cinnamon marrow, honey tubes, small green, and large class as names for melons. However, there are two types of melons. Those used in cooking, such as winter melon and loofah, are large and called "gua." Small ones are called "die." Those like gourds and are all of that category. Emperor Xiaowu of the Song dynasty wrote in a poem, "Climbing sauce to season autumn vegetables," referring to pickled cucumbers. Lu You wrote in a poem, "Sunny days expose pickled cucumbers," referring to salted cucumbers. To eat them with breakfast or drink with wine in the evening, is something that only people with refined taste can appreciate. As for watermelons and other types, they are only for relieving heat and are probably not suitable for inclusion in a menu.</p>
<p>Gourds are a type of melon. They are long and have a stem. "Hu" is also written as "hulu." In fact, it is "hu." Bitter gourds are bitter and sweet gourds are sweet. Tao Hongjing once said this. Zhengzitong says that "hu" is also called. In the past, Lu Huaixin entertained guests and told the cook, "Steam until tender, remove the hair, and don't break the neck." The listeners thought it was steamed duck. But when the lid was lifted, it was just steamed gourd. However, if the fruit is peeled and seeds removed, and cut into short segments, seasoned with salt, the fragrance is refreshing. Or cut into thin strips and mixed with dried bamboo shoots, it is also quite delicious. But people in Fujian and Guangdong prefer to eat sweet gourds and bitter gourds. It is probably what is called the different tastes of different people.</p>
<p>The Food and Goods Chronicle of the Former Han Dynasty says, "Vegetables are grown in fields, melons and gourds are grown. Old farmers can always taste the new crops." The melons and gourds in Shanghai are carried from villages by only 30-40%. The rest are bundled and carried from other places. After one night or two nights, all the essence is gone. But the price is almost the same as fish and meat. I am ashamed to be a poor scholar and have been gnawing on vegetable roots for a long time. How can I return to Wuxing and look for the land of purple and yellow eggplants?</p>

<p>The next morning at ten o'clock, Mr. Ge's first lecture was entitled "The Past, Present, and Future of Newspapers."

<h3 id="e173">Strange Tales of Turtle's Cry Ji Jin <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>A family surnamed Wang in Xiaxiang, Wuzhen, in the lake district, raised a turtle. It was nearly a hundred years old and had nothing special about it. One day last month, the owner took a boat to Shanghai. Just as he went out, the turtle suddenly raised its head and cried, chirping and squeaking like a chick looking for food. Everyone was surprised. Listeners gathered from all directions. It only stopped after about half an hour. The owner was suddenly urged to leave, but there was not enough time. He knew it was because of the turtle. He was very angry and ordered his family to throw it into the river. It sank and floated, and no one knew where it went.</p>
<p>At that time, there were many discussions. Everyone thought that there would be more bad luck than good. The owner had always been known as a reformer and did not believe in superstition. He listened to it and that was it. One day he got an alarm and learned that the boat had arrived near Luxu last night. Suddenly, it encountered bandits. Luggage and valuables were robbed. Many passengers were shot. Then he realized that the turtle was crying to save him. Overjoyed, he sent someone to the original place to find a way to retrieve it. But it had sunk into the sea. It is not known whether it can be returned to its owner. Mr. Xu, a neighbor in the same village, said this with certainty. So I have recorded it.</p>
<p>Prints. Various major newspapers before and after the Guangxu Restoration were all items that were not easily seen in a hundred years. Some were taken by Mr. Ge at the British Museum. There were more than fifty listeners, who were all colleagues in the newspaper industry. They all felt very interested. On the morning of the 3rd, the second lecture was "An Overview of the World Newspaper Industry Today." He first displayed illustrated magazines from various countries. Some were monochrome, some were three-color. All were newly printed with photogravure. It was a dazzling array. He also had maps of the communication networks of Reuters, United, and Dentsu. When he spoke of the development of the newspaper industry and news agencies in various countries and the backwardness of our country's propaganda, the listeners were all moved. On the evening of the 4th, the third lecture was "The Awakening that the Chinese Newspaper Industry Should Have." He also showed slides, showing the internal and external conditions of newspaper offices in various countries. More than a hundred people attended. The meeting only ended at midnight. After the three lectures, the Hangzhou newspaper industry deeply felt the difficulty of their own work and the difficulty of life. They asked Mr. Ge for ways to solve the problem. From this, it can be seen that the colleagues' desire to make progress is deep and sincere.</p>
<p>There are six newspapers in Hangzhou. They are the Minguo Daily, the Guomin News, the Zhijiang Daily, the Zhemin Daily, the Minsheng News, and the Zhejiang Business Daily. We have made a survey of them. Among them, the Minguo has a larger scale. The rest are simple and crude. Printing is also outsourced. Two sheets are published daily, and some are three. The editing is still good. In terms of news, it is all the same. There are few original articles that are worth reading. According to a gentleman with a long history in the newspaper industry, the advertising revenue of each newspaper is not abundant. The one with the most sales is over 3,000. All feel strapped for cash in terms of economics. Reporters are treated very poorly, so it is difficult to find many who are clean and self-respecting. Printing workers are even more difficult to deal with. In fact, the above points are not only the common disease of the inland newspaper industry, but also the metropolitan newspaper is similar. I hope that both labor and capital will do their best and gradually improve to promote progress together.</p>
<p>After arriving in Hangzhou, friends treated me to banquets almost every day. During one banquet, I talked about Hangzhou's prohibition of smoking, gambling, and prostitution, as well as the situation of bandits in Zhejiang. I heard from the elders that since the strict prohibition of smoking and gambling, there have been achievements. Social crimes have decreased invisibly. This is truly one aspect of the provincial government's achievements. However, it is not easy to sweep away all the accumulated malpractices of the evil society. Taking Hangzhou as an example, smoking and gambling seem to have been banned on the surface, but in reality they are still present. For example, public prostitutes have closed down, but private prostitutes have emerged. The authorities ban prostitutes by drawing lots. The women who have left the human flesh market are temporarily placed in shelters. At first, they did not feel bitter. Later, because of the difficulty of life and the hopelessness of marriage, they were unwilling to stay for a long time. Some came out and became private prostitutes again. This is because the authorities have failed to provide a thorough solution. Opium can still be found in hotels and apartments, where people can lie on a couch and smoke freely. Due to the police's lack of effort, red pills are now popular. People in the underworld use them to get high. According to reports, red pills are Japanese goods. Their poison is more potent than opium. Those who are addicted to them can die within two years. Banditry is frequently heard in Zhejiang. Newspapers rarely record it. The authorities use the old trick of covering their ears and stealing bells. It is not a good idea. I also heard from a gentleman who had just returned to Hangzhou from Hanzhao that opium is publicly sold in Wuhan and Hanyang. Prostitution and gambling are allowed. The two lakes special tax office only cares about a large amount of revenue and does not ask about anything else. It is regrettable.</p>

<p>(10) The Press in Tokyo</p>
<p>Tokyo is the political center of Japan. Since the Great Kanto Earthquake of the twelfth year of the Taisho era, the government and the people have worked together on reconstruction. To this day, it has largely succeeded. All buildings and city plans are being carried out according to the latest ideal city designs. Its prosperity is comparable to the world's largest metropolises such as New York, London, Paris, and Berlin. After arriving in Tokyo from Osaka on the 16th, I, as a reporter, prepared day and night for the news coverage of the conference. In my spare time, I took some tours. Regarding the various facilities of the Japanese people and the rapid advancement of their undertakings, I could only repeatedly praise them and couldn't add a single word. There is not a single thing I have seen in Tokyo that is not worth recording. But the threads are so tangled that I don't know where to start. As a reporter speaking about the press, I will first describe the press in Tokyo. The newspaper industry in Japan is currently in a golden age. There are a total of 513 newspapers nationwide, excluding 27 in Korea and 4 in Taiwan. The flourishing state of the Osaka Asahi and Mainichi Shimbun described in the previous article is not a special case in one place, but a crystallization of universal development. Education is widespread among the Japanese people, even rickshaw drivers hold newspapers in their hands and read them along the way. Moreover, the public has extremely sophisticated discernment, and newspapers with a slight slant are rejected. Therefore, newspapers such as Asahi and Mainichi are purely neutral and fulfill their responsibility as the mouthpiece of the people. Newspapers with a slant are mostly run by political parties such as the Minseito and Seiyukai. As for openly receiving subsidies from the government, that is almost non-existent. In areas where local newspapers are thriving, there are often more than ten, or at least two or three. Their operating income is sufficient for self-sufficiency. However, some larger and more profitable ones, such as the Fukuoka Nichinichi Shimbun, have a capital of one million yuan and sell hundreds of thousands of copies daily, earning hundreds of thousands of yuan annually. The Kobe Shimbun has a capital of 400,000 yuan, and its sales and profits are also over 100,000, enough to dominate one area. Japanese newspapers all operate evening editions, so there is no gap in the news. If there is any important news, an extra is issued, costing one or two copper coins. Evening editions also sell for two copper coins. Newsboys sell them along the way and sell out in an instant. There are 22 daily newspapers and 42 news agencies in Tokyo. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, and Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun have a newspaper capital of over 300,000 yuan and sales of over 100,000 copies. , Hochi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Chugai Commercial News, Jiji Shinpō, Miyako Shimbun, Kokumin Shimbun, Yorozu Chōhō, Tokyo Every</p>
<p>Evening News, Tokyo Taisei Shimbun, and the English-language Japan Times. Among the news agencies, the larger ones include the Japan Telegraphic Communication Agency, with a capital of one million yuan, the Japan News Agency with 500,000 yen, the Nikkan Chuo News Agency with a capital of 500,000 yuan, the Insurance Nichinichi News Agency with a capital of 100,000 yuan, the Tokyo News Agency with a capital of 100,000 yuan, the Toyokuni News Agency with a capital of 200,000 yuan, the Day and Night News Agency with a capital of 100,000 yuan, the News United News Agency, the Naiwai News Agency with a capital of 500,000 yuan, and the Imperial News Agency with a capital of 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Lü Xing was upright and had a chivalrous spirit. He was poor in his youth and often lived with relatives. One day, he returned from the school and passed by a teahouse. He saw a fortune teller beckoning him to sit down and said to him, "Your appearance is extraordinary, with a tiger's jaw and a swallow's neck. You are definitely a person like Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. However, your Huagai star is too low, and you have very little fortune." Lü smiled and said, "My family is as poor as can be. I am lucky to avoid freezing and starvation. How dare I have any hope?" He left without paying attention. A tea guest in the seat had inherited a hundred plots of land, but it was seized by a powerful man. He had been suing for a long time without success. Hearing the fortune teller's words, he spent money to help Lü and persuaded him to study at the Army Lecture Hall in the provincial capital. He also said, "If you become noble in the future, I beg you to help with this matter. I dare not hope for anything else." Lü reluctantly agreed. In a few years, he graduated from the examination and was assigned as a company commander in a certain battalion. He entered and exited military gates and had some power. He immediately wrote a letter to the county magistrate, ordering the return of the land to the guest. The guest was endlessly grateful to him. After Lü was promoted to division commander, he became even stricter with his subordinates. If anything displeased him, he would scold them at every turn. None of his subordinates dared to disobey him in the slightest. One day, he was playing chess with a certain councilor. Halfway through the game, he suddenly got up and went inside. The councilor sat and waited for a long time, feeling very hungry. However, he did not dare to leave rashly. A guard entered to report, "The councilor is still here. We should give him lunch." Lü scolded, "What lunch? Eating my cannon is enough for him!" He was angry because he was losing the chess game. Such events were common. Some said that Lü's character was cruel and ungrateful, which was enough to bring about his own death.</p>
<p>Special Announcement: Yesterday, we received a telegram from Mr. Wu Kunyi of our Hangzhou branch, saying that a literary friend, Mr. Tang Meixi, committed suicide by taking an anesthetic potion in a certain room at the West Lake Hotel the night before last. He was discovered the next morning and rushed to the Hangzhou Hospital for treatment. His life can be saved without danger. Please notify his relatives, etc. Hearing the news, we were shocked and terrified. Because we do not know the whereabouts of Mr. Tang's relatives, we are publishing this notice to inform them. We hope they will go to the Hangzhou Hospital to visit him. Respectfully, Shou Juan.</p>

<p>(Shen) Facilities for Tokyo's Electrical Business are Improving Daily. As an island nation, Japan relies on hydroelectric power generation. Throughout the country, all industries, commerce, and machinery use electricity as a driving force. Supply even exceeds demand. National statistics suggest there may be a surplus of electrical power. From Tokyo to Yokohama, in addition to railway trains powered by electricity, including door opening and closing, four electric tram tracks are also installed, reaching Yokohama directly. Moreover, the entire city, in addition to ordinary trams running on city streets, also has elevated trams and subway trams. Ordinary trams only have first-class seating, unlike the Tianjin-Shanghai trams in our China, which have first, second, and third class. However, the seating is spacious and clean. The tram depots are also lined with green flanges. Traveling within the city, regardless of distance, costs only seven sen per person, equivalent to seven fen in Japanese currency. Travel outside the city incurs a slight additional fee depending on the distance. Students from various schools who purchase monthly passes with their school certificates also receive special discounts. The electrical facilities can be roughly divided into three categories. (1) Electricity Supply: In addition to electric railways, electric tramways, and factory engines, the annual electricity supply for lighting in Tokyo and its 12 surrounding villages and towns is provided to 152,308 households. The total number of lights is 1,090,903. The power is over 45,000 horsepower. The total cost of all electric lights, power, wiring, and equipment is 7,963,162 yuan. (2) Power Equipment: Currently, Tokyo has the Tokyo Railway Co., Ltd., the Electric Power Co., Ltd., and the Tokyo Electric Light Co., Ltd. engaged in electric railway and electricity supply businesses. After the Great Kanto Earthquake on September 1, 1923, most of these were destroyed. These companies actively engaged in reconstruction. Construction began in 1926 and was completed in November 1928. Except for a large part of the railway being a state-run enterprise, the Electric Power Co., Ltd. spent as much as 180 million yuan, and the Tokyo Electric Light Co., Ltd. spent as much as 60 million yuan. (3) Tokyo Municipal Electrical Research Institute: Tokyo's electric railway and electricity supply businesses require thorough research in scientific and economic aspects. Necessary knowledge is essential for perfect implementation. This institute was established with funding from the Tokyo Electric Light Co., Ltd.'s survey and research organization in 1921. The construction of the building began in 1923. After the Great Earthquake, it was vigorously pursued, taking two and a half years and costing over 1.2 million yuan. The Tokyo Municipal Electrical Research Institute was fully established in October 1925. Currently, the important tasks of the institute include six items: (1) Electrical instrument testing. (2) Electrical appliance testing. (3) Research and investigation of electrical relations. (4) Patent registration. (5) Electrical museum. (6) Patent implementation and related manufacturing.</p>
<p>(You) Compilation and Statistical Survey of the History of Tokyo: Tokyo's process of national capital transformation and the difficulties of centuries of construction projects are of great historical significance. In October 1901, the Tokyo Municipal Assembly passed a resolution to establish a compilation committee, initiating the investigation and compilation of system evolution. After several evolutions and reforms, a concrete and detailed planning and statistics were developed. The municipal history is classified into fifteen chapters. The first chapter is a general record of the history of Tokyo. Chapters two through fifteen are divided into records of the city's land, municipal administration, city industry, city transportation, city education, city religion, city sanitation, city military affairs, city relief, city literature and art, city customs, city diplomacy, city history, and a city development chronology. This is the classification of the municipal history compilation. For municipal surveys, fifteen series are planned for compilation. The first series is on urban administrative organization. The second series is a general overview of municipal administration. The third to fourteenth series cover twelve aspects of administration: finance, education, social health, industry, roads, waterworks, sewers, river ports, parks, electricity, and public enterprises. The fifteenth series is on district administration. Of these fifteen series, only the first, fourth, and fifth series have been published. The rest are still being compiled or are still under investigation. In addition, the liaison for urban surveys and statistics is the Right Metropolitan Survey and Statistics Association. Its important functions are five: (1) Comparative survey of financial administration in major cities. (2) Survey on increasing efficiency in urban administrative affairs. (3) Unification of urban statistical survey items and methods. (4) Compilation of comparative statistical yearbooks for six major cities. (5) Comparative survey of public enterprises in major cities.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Financial Bar Gold Plummets Seven Taels <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Spot prices plummet in a falling market, breaking the barrier. Yesterday, the 19th, the decline in bar gold intensified, having already broken the 600 tael barrier. Initially, it was still stable, but then it fell sharply, with a fluctuation of nearly ten taels in half a day. Foreign exchange was weakening, with little activity in bank transactions, and although market trading was brisk, the psychology of the industry was weak, with selling generally exceeding buying. Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Xingyong, Yu Da, Da Yong, Da, etc. all sold, while Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongzhi, Fengyong, etc. bought. Since the morning market was low, it was mediocre. As buyers became strong, it became firm, now seen around 606 taels. In the future, exchange rates seem to be loosening, and large households are inclined to sell. Spot goods are especially quiet, and prices are also declining. Futures, forced by the environment, suddenly turned down and fell sharply by almost ten taels, plummeting to around 596 taels. The market will be closed over the weekend as usual. Yesterday, the Bank of England fell by 1/8, the forward rate by 1/16, and the Bank of America by 1/8.</p>
<p>Initially stable, but eventually falling steadily. September gold opened slightly up by 8 cents, at 604 taels. It then fell by 5 or 6 cents, but with Fuchang, Zhifengyong buying, it rose by 2, 3 or 4 cents, reaching 5 taels and 8 cents. The first order was revealed, and the listed price did not change, so it fell to 4 taels and 3 cents. In a moment, it rose and fell slightly by 1 tael, and the internal first order was fixed. Banks were mutually doing July at 6 pence 125, and Citibank was doing September at 37 yuan, reaching 605 taels at 10:00. Later, July was doing 6 pence 1875, August 25, and Hengxing, Yu Da, Yuanmao, Yong, etc. were all selling, and the price was getting lower and lower. Soon, the 600 tael barrier was broken. Around 11:00, it was 599 taels. At that time, it was replenished by small households, and it returned to 600 taels and 8 cents. After 11:15, the selling sentiment of large households such as Yongda, Fuxing, and Yongbingxing was strong, causing the market to become even more sluggish, with almost no chance of recovery. The 600 tael barrier was broken again, but although foreign exchange was weakening, trading was idle. By 11:30, it was only 97 taels. After a short time, it recovered by about 2 taels, but sellers were incessant. Because the market is closed today (Sunday), those who previously held long positions were eager to level out, and it fell again by 2 taels. By noon, it closed at 596 taels and 2 cents, a decrease of 7 taels compared to the previous day. It has fallen for three consecutive days, totaling 9 taels. The highest price in the previous market was 605 taels and 8 cents, and the lowest price was 596 taels and 2 cents, a difference of 9 taels and 6 cents. The listed price was still 657 taels. The initial press was 52 and 3 taels, and at noon it was suppressed by more than 60 taels. The accounts for July and August were 95 taels, September was 96 taels, the replenishment was 95 taels, the opening price for goods was 603 taels and 7 cents, and the noon closing price was 596 taels.</p>
<p>Industry psychology is negative, and they concentrate on selling. Hengxing, Yuanmao Yong, Bingxing, Yongda, Yu Da, and Fuxingyong had the most transactions. Changshengyong, Yuanheng, Xinheng, and Yuxingyong all sold in the morning. Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Wanxing, and Shunli had irregular ups and downs. Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, Tongtaichang, Yongfeng, Yuanxingyong, and retail households all bought. There were occasional entries and exits of hedging strips. The Dalian gang traded about 2,000 strips, and after entering and exiting, they still bought 200 to 300 strips. The Guangdong gang sold more than 1,000 long positions.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Slightly Optimistic</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, with overseas cotton yarn market conditions trending upward and sentiment rising. However, trading is still quiet. Because domestic conditions are not good, it has not been able to follow it upward. The situation is still calm. However, the price increase of three-ply yarn is drastic. Sales of Yunnan gang coarse yarn are still strong. Other gangs have no enthusiasm. Sichuan is selling forward contracts for yarn due to the severe drought in Sichuan and the poor harvest.</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn Clearing Bureau Has Not Left. The opening of the bidding market followed the foreign cotton and was firm. The atmosphere was tighter. All months rose by 0.036 yuan.

<p>The cotton market has turned firm, with American cotton trending upward. The Japanese firm Dongmian Yoko seized the opportunity to cover short positions for about 10,000 dan in both the front and back markets. Consequently, the market sentiment was stimulated, leading to a tighter situation, and the market felt increasingly dry. However, most small traders still intended to go short, and trading remained slow. If American cotton can continue to rise, local cotton naturally has a chance of turning around.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Gongtai Leads in Buying Volume <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>

<h3 id="e187">The Progress of American Cotton Over the Past Week <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 18th reports on the cotton market over the past week. The market conditions on the New York Cotton Exchange were relatively quiet last week. When the October price reached 12.5 cents, traders bought in, and shorts covered, leading to immediate development. However, in reality, traders had no demand, and the weather and new cotton were not favorable to the bulls, which was enough to cause buying. As a result, the value was difficult to rise, even if prices rose, it easily led to new sellers and pressure from trade. At the beginning of the week, the temperature was relatively mild, and there were sellers when it rained in the cotton-producing areas. However, most of the Midwest still needed rain, so those who sold due to good weather in the East were also limited.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Grain and Rice Market Seems to Have Stalled Again <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, about ten rice boats were seen coming down the river. Currently, there are probably forty boats of Japonica rice, thin rice, and Indica rice. Market transactions are very quiet. After the Rice Merchants Association announced the restoration of regulations and free trading, their attitude was very firm. However, the Social Affairs Bureau has not yet publicly announced its approval, so although the rice price assessment committee has formally ended, rice merchants still feel that they need to wait. Therefore, there were no transactions in Northern Japonica rice, thin rice, Xiang rice, or white rice throughout the day, and the trend seems to be stalled again.</p>
<p>Hunan A few cargo ships were seen, but sales were very slow. The price of Jiangsu-Tong Japonica rice continued to decline, with ordinary goods only around 20 yuan. Compared to the previous day, it had to be cut by about 5 fen. Xiangjian market sentiment was weak, and foreign rice was also declining steadily. Yesterday, it saw a small drop of about 2 jiao. Therefore, the intention to purchase on this street was extremely sluggish, with very little turnover of accumulated stocks, and few arrivals. The market was stable, with the overall price still around 18.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Foreign Rice Fell in the Morning and Rose in the Afternoon <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw weak sentiment from both local and out-of-town buyers in the morning, and the market showed signs of fatigue and weakness. Prices fell by about 1 jiao. In the afternoon, there were slight inquiries in this street, with both inland and Dalian merchants buying over a thousand bags, and the market turned around, with prices also rising by about 1 jiao. Market sentiment was also generally optimistic. However, in general, the market has too much inventory, and out-of-town merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, so there is no strong hope for a sustained rise. Total transactions for the day included 4,000 bags of Saigon No. 1, priced at 17.4 yuan to 17 yuan; 500 bags of No. 2, priced at 15.5 yuan; 3,000 bags of small-grain rice, priced at 15.6 yuan to 15.34 yuan; 3,500 bags of large-grain rice, priced at 13.9 yuan to 13.6 yuan; and 1,500 bags of Mindang, priced at 15.87 yuan to 15.5 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Flour Standard and Inland Merchants Continuously Sell Off <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed weakness in all months after the opening. Although foreign wheat quotations rebounded by 4, 5, 6, or 7 jiao, overall market sentiment did not improve significantly. This is because the inland merchants (mostly from Wuxi) believe that early-maturing wheat will soon be harvested, and reports from various places indicate a good harvest, with 80-90% certainty of a bumper crop. Therefore, those who previously intended to buy high have now changed their attitude due to the environment, either closing their long positions or engaging in short selling, especially in the distant months. Looking ahead, if actual sales remain sluggish, it should weaken further. As a result, the current month was down by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, August was down by 7.5 li, October was down by 1 fen, November was down by 1.25 fen, and December was down by 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Distant Wheat Market Suffers Another Loss in the Evening Session <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw little fluctuation in the morning for all months compared to the previous day's close. With the foreign wheat quotations improving, market sentiment was somewhat influenced. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market weakened again, and market sentiment was affected. This is because inland merchants felt that the early-maturing wheat harvest was promising, and they were closing their long positions for all months. It was also rumored that customers related to a certain factory suddenly dumped large quantities, causing the market sentiment for distant months to weaken further. Given the changed environment, the future outlook remains unfavorable. As a result, the current month was down by 3 fen compared to the previous day, August was down by 2 fen, September was down by 4 fen, October was down by 4 fen, November was down by 5 fen, and December was down by 3 fen. The spot wheat market declined in tandem with the standard. Market inventory is around 100,000 bags, causing market sentiment to be weak and unwilling to sell. Yesterday, all grades opened lower by 3-4 fen. For example, Xuzhou old wheat opened at a minimum of 4 taels and 8.5 qian, down 2-3 qian compared to the previous day. 4,500 bags of new and old wheat from Shashi, Haizhou, and Xuzhou were opened and bought by Fufeng and Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Sugar Market Spot Dutch Red Opens Strong <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Rising Trend Slightly Settled... Green Sugar Shortage Causes Sharp Rise. Yesterday, sugar market reports from production areas indicated that Cuban spot sugar was still priced at 1.35, New York sugar futures for September were at 1.21, down 1 point, December was at 1.29, down 2 points, March was at 1.40 with no change, and May was at 1.47, also down 1 point. Javanese spot sugar was priced at 8.9375, up 0.0625, while sugar futures remained unchanged. Coarse sand white buying interest from the association was slightly quiet, with sellers asking for 8 taels, but few inquiries were made. Later, 7 taels and 9.5 qian saw slight transactions, and the market shape was firm. No. 20 medium sand white was 7 taels and 7.5 qian, with few transactions. High No. 10 Dutch red was 6 taels and 7 qian, and the market was relatively stable. Nissin YRO marked at 7 taels and 9.25 qian, Meiji goods at 7 taels and 9.5 qian, Minghua YT marked at 8 taels and 0.75 qian, and YP marked at 8 taels and 3 qian. Transactions were scattered, and the market appeared flat and lacked vitality. The price board had Zhenxiang Hao offering 1,000 bags of Cuban foreign sugar at 7 taels and 2 qian, 2,000 bags of No. 8 Dutch red at 6 taels and 4.5 qian. Lijige Yoko also sold 1,500 bags of High No. 10 Dutch red at 6 taels and 7.5 qian. Other companies such as Huaxin also opened sales. The total amount was quite large, but prices varied. The market appeared relatively stable. The market for green sugar was particularly short. Only small Luqing could be supplied, and Binghuaqing was lacking in the market. As a result, the price board increased, with some asking for 7 taels for No. 4 small Luqing, but there was little hope of transactions. The market for domestic green sugar was still sold out. Yesterday, 67 packages of Longjiang green were opened at 6 taels and 5 qian, and the goods were black and of poor quality, but demand was strong. It was heard that it was bought by Jiaxing merchants, which shows the strength of the market.</p>
<h3 id="e193">North-South Goods, New Golden Vegetables Second Batch Arrived <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The second batch of new golden vegetables arrived yesterday, totaling 83 pieces. Samples were seen, and they were allocated to various merchants as per their orders. Daxing Vegetable Company sold them for 28 taels and 7 qian, and Dingzhuang Vegetable Company sold them for 29 taels and 2 qian. The market shape was stable. The next batch may continue to arrive within days.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Silk and Tea, European Silk Sales Continue to be Slow and Weak <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Recently, overseas markets have seen silk weaving factories largely suspend operations for summer vacation, and silk sales have been sluggish. Yesterday was Saturday, with only a half-day market in the morning, and the silk market was nearly stagnant. Yesterday, only Jianna purchased 10 bales of Shanghai white factory silk of grade B top head, thread count 13-15, priced at 1,145 taels, and Xinfu purchased 5 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk of grade small car top head, thread count 13-15, priced at 720 taels.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the raw silk market in Lyon has been trending downward. Spot silk has only seen sporadic transactions. Currently, silk sales have been even more lifeless due to silk weaving factories suspending operations for summer vacation. Silk prices have been declining, especially for Japanese silk. Grade A is only opening at 250 francs, Grade B at 218 francs, and Grade C at 200 francs (per kilo), a decrease of 5 francs to 8 francs.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Qining Floral Scented Tea Transactions Continue Smoothly <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port saw continued strong buying interest from Russian companies and the Cooperative Association for floral-scented black tea from Qimen and Ningzhou. British companies such as Jardine also showed interest, and transactions were not quiet. However, the Russian companies have consistently maintained a tight-pricing strategy, and the market is controlled by them. The current prices for floral-scented tea are lower than before. The market for green tea has not seen significant development. Recently, Gaozhuang Zhenmei has been slightly purchased by Baochang Yoko, but the market has abundant hoarding, with supply exceeding demand. According to observations by general tea merchants, green tea is expected to be more active next month.</p>

<p>Regarding the breathing of women, French doctors had previously made reports on their tests. However, women cultivated in modern life have naturally undergone changes. Recently, Francis G. Benedict of New York, USA, published the results of his research over the years. Although it is a small discovery, it has attracted attention from the European and American scientific communities. According to his report, women breathe three to five times per minute, with the strongest women as the standard for testing. At most, it is only six to eight times. He obtained the results two years ago, but still thought it was not enough to be credible. This year, he traveled to Europe to give lectures and conduct tests, and the results were the same. Therefore, he recently formally published his results to the scientific community, which is considered to be of great help to doctors specializing in women's diseases and pharmacists in their formulations.

<h3 id="e198">The Future of European and American Air Routes <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Although there have been several long-distance flights across the Atlantic between Europe and America, they have all been trials and have not carried passengers or transported mail. In this era of increasing progress in European and American civilization, it still takes many days to travel from the United States to Europe, which many people feel is inconvenient. According to recent German newspaper reports, the plan for a commercial airline across the Atlantic between Europe and America has gradually become a reality after several years of planning. The air route goes from Baltimore in the central United States to Seirle in Spain, from where it can be connected to major European cities by land flights. For safety reasons, an airport will be set up on Bermuda Island in the Atlantic Ocean for practical use. The cost of air travel from the United States to Spain is twice the cost of a ship, but the time required is only two days. The return trip from Spain to the United States is also only three days. There will be a total of four aircraft. In addition to the German Graf Zeppelin, three new aircraft will need to be built. Two of them are being manufactured by the U.S. Navy Department in Akron, and the remaining one is being manufactured in Germany. The equipment used has never been used in aircraft before. The estimated opening date is set for 1932. (Yi Kang)</p>

<p>The United States Navy Department recently accepted a huge machine gun. The gun was created by Robert F. during the European War under political commission. Although the European War has long since passed, this gun was only recently completed by Haas. It is estimated that this gun can fire eight hundred 50-pound shells per minute at a distance of nine miles. One person can fire it. The gun body is longer than ordinary gun bodies. Although its form is old, the Navy Department has accepted it, and plans to reward Haas for his efforts. (Yi Kang)</p>

<h3 id="e200">National Characteristics of Various Countries by Yang Zhijing <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Written by Zhang Anshi</p>
<p>Published by Huatong Bookstore</p>
<p>(Individuals have personalities, nations have national characteristics.) This is undeniable by anyone. We see the Renaissance, originating in Italy, yet after its spread to various countries, no two are the same. The religious revolution, originating in Germany, also became different in each country after spreading. For example, the modern socialist thought, initially originating from Saint-Simon and Owen, also developed differently in each country. England still only has the trade union movement. The French Socialist Party is slightly more radical. Germany created social democracy, and Russia transformed into the Soviet. After analyzing these in detail using scientific methods, we naturally believe that this is all due to the existence of national character. This is all the result of the integration of the great dominating force of different national characteristics.</p>
<p>Detailed research into various nations and exploration of their historical rise and fall can naturally provide our Chinese nation with a great awakening. The author tells us that there are six common characteristics of declining national characteristics: (1) tepid emotions, (2) weak will, (3) strong individuality but weak restraint, (4) suspicion, (5) imitation, and (6) lack of order. Today, the cruel behavior and cold methods of the Greek, Indian, and Egyptian national characters, their weak will, lack of responsibility, and lack of thoroughness, the division of Indian religious tribal groups, and the suspicious nature of the Greeks, who are called "foxes," all symbolize the decline of national character. Looking back at the current state of our own Chinese national character, undeniable facts tell us that we may have to add two more flaws: "laziness" and "selfishness." Moreover, the majority of the people simply do not understand the glory of fighting for the nation, nor do they have a sense of national consciousness. Looking around at emerging nations such as England, Germany, France, and the United States, "once the country is in trouble, the Conservative Party can cooperate with the Progressive Party, and the Labor Party can work with capitalist groups." What should we think when we see this?</p>
<p>There are indeed very few Chinese scholars who study national character, and even fewer works that study national character. In the long-suffering and decadent Chinese nation, most scholars are probably intoxicated by the environment and have forgotten the so-called nation. The book "National Characteristics of Various Countries" does not dissect the diseased state of the Chinese nation. However, in our Chinese nation, which has long forgotten national consciousness, it can at least provide a stimulus. Comparing the facts of the rise and fall of various national characters, we can see which direction our Chinese nation has been heading in recent times. We are treading on the same path as the decadent national characteristics everywhere. Are we willing to degenerate, or should we brace ourselves and strive for self-determination?</p>
<p>The content of "National Characteristics of Various Countries" is divided into four chapters. In addition to the first and last chapters, which are introductions and conclusions, the second chapter discusses prosperous national characteristics and contains more than twenty-six sections, detailing the national characteristics of Germany, England, America, France, Russia, Italy, and Japan. The third chapter discusses declining national characteristics, with five sections describing the reasons for the decline of the national characteristics of Egypt, Judah, Greece, India, and Spain.</p>
<p>As the author said, "It is very difficult to understand the national characteristics of various countries. First, one must read extensively from various scholars' research on national character. Second, one must travel around various countries and have a deep understanding of the social conditions of each country. Third, one must thoroughly research the spiritual and material aspects of each country." Amidst these many difficulties, the author is even more capable of organizing it systematically using scientific methods and writing it out. We should naturally consider it satisfactory. Before the author studies the characteristics of a nation, he first introduces the natural environment of that country, and then analyzes the historical facts, as well as the cultural environment and overview of thought, in a well-organized manner. While it should not be admitted that the environment has such a great dominating force, and that changes in the environment can also cause races to change accordingly, mentality is influenced by education, and the environment also has considerable power. We naturally cannot absolutely deny it. The author also means this, as he said in the fourth chapter of the introduction, "Based on the scope of research on national character, in addition to heredity, we also emphasize the environment of various national characters, including not only the natural environment but also the social environment."</p>
<p>After reading this book, based on the proof of historical facts, the path our Chinese nation is taking every day is a dead end. We absolutely do not have the common points of emerging national characteristics. We only have the common points of declining national characteristics. Look, "As long as there are three Germans in one place, they will inevitably organize groups." But what is the national character of our Chinese people? Like a sheet of loose sand, "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs," there is absolutely no habit of communal living. Compared with the emerging German national character, it has become an extremely opposite portrayal. Secondly, Germany "during the disturbances of October 1918, the Kiel sailors became independent, and various places responded, even calling for Wilhelm II to abdicate. When the revolution first started, outsiders guessed that Germany would become a second Soviet Russia. But in less than a year, the National Assembly was convened, the constitution was completed, and the political situation was stabilized... still in an orderly manner, without chaotic steps... without following in the footsteps of Soviet Russia. This is entirely an expression of the nation's love for order." And what is the national character of our China? From the beginning of the Republic of China to the present, it has not been able to create a complete constitution, nor has it shown any love for the nation or for order. There has been civil war all year round, only seeing self-abandonment and adding to the symbols of decline.</p>
<p>"The character of our people is to say and not do, the character of the French is to say and then do, the character of the Germans is to do and then say, the character of the British is to do and not say." It is naturally not a bad thing to express opinions as much as possible, but only seeing theoretical articles and never embodying them in reality, what is the benefit? It only provokes people's sneers. This is also a defect of declining national character, which the emerging national characters of France, Germany, and England do not have. The author's judgment is naturally very incisive. (Just look at the "lengthy paper articles" of tens of thousands of words, and the "singing of high-sounding tunes," etc., which are all proofs of the fact of "saying and not doing," while British diplomacy and news are known for their unobtrusive approach.)</p>
<p>"A small island country, with only sixty years of restoration, publicly joins the ranks of the world's great powers. Speaking of military equipment, the army has defeated Russia, and the navy's achievements have surpassed those of France and Italy. Domestic industry, almost everything that Europe and America have, Japan can imitate. This spirit of struggle is naturally worthy of attention... Ancient history says that some people saw the Spartans' diet and said that bad food like that is worse than death, so Spartan warriors emerged. If you have seen the lives of the Japanese, you can understand their struggle." Turning our heads to look at the situation in our country, what a situation it is. Such a large nation has only ended up with backward industries. In a big city, almost everything must be sought from imported goods. Not only is there a lack of willingness to struggle, but there is also extravagance and extreme luxury. Isn't this digging one's own grave?</p>
<p>The most peculiar national character has to be that of Russia, which takes extreme approaches everywhere, but is impermanent. Due to climate and religious reasons, it forms their laziness, but at the same time, it can produce great spirit and become a great nation.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>, The path that the nation takes, whether it is prosperity or decline, is worthy of people's contemplation. We see in the book that "Russia took the path of an extremely autocratic imperial regime" and turned into communist politics. This change was so rapid that it was as if yesterday there were only rickshaws, and today airships have been discovered. Such an extreme change has almost no second example in history except for Russia. Therefore, the world recognizes Russia as mysterious, and Russians as a mysterious nation. In fact, by studying the Russian national character, one realizes that this extreme change is inherent in Russia and is not surprising at all. It can be seen everywhere in Russian society... even the changes in Soviet Russian politics after the war can prove a lot. For example, at the beginning of the revolution, communism was strictly enforced, the capitalist system was broken, and imperialism was overthrown. But after 1923, it was felt that this path was not feasible, so it was changed to restore the capitalist economy and to associate with imperialists. Since it has restored the capitalist economy, it is also sending people to disturb foreign countries and constantly propagate communism." Looking again at Russia's greatness, "The Russian national character is naturally great. This greatness can be seen in the spirit, in philosophy, in culture, in art, and in architecture, and it can also be seen in politics. For example, when Russia was formerly autocratic, it often aimed at world hegemony and declared when it declared war on Japan that it would open Japan as a world park. This is one example," but it is inevitably too abstract. This is also where the shortcomings of the Russian national character lie.</p>
<p>What will be the path taken by this strange and extremely contradictory Russian national character in the future? What will be the future of the new national movement? The author dare not make a judgment, and it is feared that it is not optimistic.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the chapter on declining national characteristics, the author tells us this: "Declining nations are those that once had civilization, but after a decline, they never recover. Other countries either become strong through revolution or are governed through restoration. Only declining nations not only do not understand revolution and restoration, but even if there are revolutions and restorations, they only help to fuel turmoil." Please look at the situation in our country, is it like this?</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Chinese Enigma by Chunsen <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Written by Li Qingya</p>
<p>Rainy season and dense fog. With nothing to do in a guest house, I happened to flip through the fourth issue of the first volume of New Literature and Art Magazine, in which the most eye-catching article was Mr. Li Qingya's "A Chinese Enigma."</p>
<p>There are very many Chinese enigmas, but in the eyes of our own people, we think they are ordinary and unremarkable. Unfortunately, in the eyes of foreign races, they are full of surprises and speculations. Therefore, what we ourselves think is unimportant, they on the contrary labor their minds and nerves to care about us, and even take them into their so-called chemical rooms, which they claim are developed by material civilization, or publicize them, saying that there are so many strange things in China. Before the Opium War, China did not sign any commercial treaties with foreigners, so China was still an ancient civilized country in the East, with a seemingly sacred and inviolable dignity, which made the general foreigners respect and obey it. Thus the act of "tribute" occurred. In fact, "speaking of tribute, it was nothing more than a one-sided muddled discussion by those who considered themselves figures of the Celestial Dynasty at the time. In fact, we should at least regard it as a kind of adventurous behavior of those yellow-haired, green-eyed races." What exactly is inside the great ancient country of the East in their ideals is a question they urgently need to solve. Finally, they were willing to compromise, changing bowing to kowtowing, becoming a thing worthy of glory for the Chinese nation. I remember a ridiculous thing, the flow of Chinese silk into the West, which is enough to sigh about. A foreign missionary, because he was afraid that scholars and people from the exporting places would find out, which was not clever, secretly put silkworm seeds in his shoes, so that he could safely deceive them. But now, good silkworm seeds have to be purchased from foreign countries. Isn't this a good story? As for other things, there are too many to count. In short, the secrets of China continue to be an enigma, and it does not matter if they form enigmas in their minds. However, Chinese writers do not seem to have time to care about this enigmatic thing, which is so regrettable and pitiful. Now, thanks to Mr. Li Qingya's initiation, he has relatively revealed a little bit of the glory of our nation, which can also be said to show some color to foreigners. Moreover, we often see Mr. Li Qingya's translations. Creation is very difficult, so this article is even more valuable.</p>
<p>"A Chinese Enigma" is like this. During the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty, a Westerner from some country came to China to pay tribute. At a banquet of entertainment, he tasted "Yuanxiao" (sweet rice balls). That white, round, sweet, and crispy dessert was praised every time he ate it. But they got a strange question, that is, "the dessert they ate in the north was made from a natural fresh fruit that was dried whole," and "determined that even if this dessert was not a natural thing, no one but Confucius could create such a treasure. Furthermore, it is said that only Confucius knew the secret." Later, they questioned again, "How can such a round core be so tightly and evenly wrapped in a deep round shell, without revealing a trace? Chinese toys are really endless enigmas." Finally, after the yamen exhausted all methods and promised to give one hundred taels of silver as a deposit for custom-making two thousand Yuanxiao, a pastry shop was willing to make Yuanxiao for them to see. On the appointed date, they went to the workshop of the shop that claimed to be a follower of Confucius to see the result. After the shopkeeper explained to them one by one, they nodded as if they understood, watching the old craftsman make them. At the same time, they ordered the scientific attendants and doctors to measure the ingredients of each hundred Yuanxiao, how they were matched, and even the weight of that bowl of clear water had to be carefully measured. Before leaving, the minister asked the shopkeeper, "Are you all disciples of Confucius?" The shopkeeper replied, "We dare not climb so high, dare not, dare not, dare not, we only respect Guan Yu and the God of Wealth." Thus, although the diplomat understood why Yuanxiao is Yuanxiao, the enigma of why the pastry shopkeeper dared not climb to be a disciple of Confucius but only respected Guan Yu and the God of Wealth has never been solved. I don't know what the diplomats of the so-called foreign country think now, has it been solved or not?</p>
<p>The author's description of the workshop is so detailed and thorough that I feel like I am there. The actions of those diplomats are also very vivid, revealing all the Chinese enigmas. I hope Mr. Li continues to work hard so that we can read such interesting works, and I also hope that the Chinese literary world will discover more of this kind of work.</p>
<p>After writing these random thoughts, the sound of violent wind blowing through the dense leaves came aggressively, reminding me of the impact the Chinese nation has suffered before and after trade, and I cannot help but feel the past and present.</p>

<p>The Primitive Culture of Taiwan's Indigenous Tribes</p>
<p>(1) The Tayal tribe of the Northern Indigenous People reside in the mountainous regions of northern Taiwan. They are fierce and combative, and are the most barbaric. Headhunting is prevalent, and the number of heads taken determines their military merit ranking. However, this practice is gradually declining. Most of the pacification efforts in Taiwan are directed at this tribe, but they are the most stubborn and difficult to subdue.</p>
<p>(2) A photo of the surveyor, Mr. Lin Huixiang, taken with the indigenous people of Lama Bawan Village. When asked to take a photo with the indigenous people, they all wore their clothes, carried knives and guns. The women were unwilling, but after much persuasion, two of them finally agreed. The people squatting in the picture are them.</p>
<p>(3) A type of woven fabric. Garments adorned with ancient grain beads are extremely precious ceremonial attire. Only the elders and the strong were allowed to wear them. This particular garment has as many as sixty thousand grain beads.</p>
<p>(4) Indigenous People's Artwork</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Huixiang of the Ethnology Society of the former Social Science Research Institute of the Academia Sinica in Shanghai went to Taiwan to collect specimens and investigate their way of life. The task has now been completed. The indigenous people of Taiwan, also known as raw aborigines or Gaoshan aborigines, originally belonged to the Malay race. During the Stone Age, they entered Taiwan from Nanyang. Separated from the outside world, isolated from foreign cultures, they largely retained their original culture. The various tribes are a good subject for cultural anthropology. They can be divided into seven major tribes, with a population of about 130,000. They are mainly located in the central mountainous areas and the east coast of Hualien. To this day, they still maintain their traditions. Trade between Taiwanese Han people and indigenous people is limited. Their livelihoods are based on rudimentary agriculture and hunting. The highest level in their social structure is the tribe, followed by the clans and families. Some tribes practice a matriarchal system. The practice of "issuing orders" (headhunting) is used to demonstrate bravery. Ancestor worship is practiced, with some tribes worshiping snakes as their ancestors. Due to the practice of headhunting and snake worship, their knowledge of human origins and snake patterns is extremely basic. Their tattoos, tribal songs, and concepts of numbers and time are all underdeveloped. They cannot record years and have no writing. Mr. Lin's collection includes 143 specimens, divided into weapons, clothing, jewelry, household items, artworks, entertainment items, and record-keeping tools. The Museum of the Governor-General of Taiwan has none of these. The information gained from these specimens is not only useful for understanding the customs of the indigenous people but also reveals the primitive aspects of their civilization. Those who are interested in researching the origins of various human institutions and cultures will find this to be a valuable reference.</p>
<p>(5) The peculiar boats of the Yami tribe. The boats used by the Yami people have high prows and sterns. They are decorated with feathers. The high prows were originally intended to block wind and waves, but now they have become purely decorative. The boat's hull is carved with human figures and various clan symbols.</p>
<p>(6) This is carved from hardwood and is about one foot tall. The hair is arranged in a spiral shape. The carving is rudimentary, and the head is disproportionately small compared to the body. Most of the carved heads depict people who have committed serious crimes. Distinguishing between males and females:</p>
<p>The leather cap decorated with feathers is made of deerskin. A corner is cut off and joined together. It is decorated with bird feathers and supplemented with red patterns. The feathers are from the Taiwanese pheasant bird. It is usually worn during festivals and removed during hunting.</p>
<p>(7) Pottery used by indigenous people. These vessels are about one foot tall, thick and blue in color, decorated with spiral patterns, and have three legs. They are made by hand and fired on flat ground. The spiral patterns resemble snakes and are simple and primitive.</p>
<p>(8) Two indigenous people's dwellings. The houses of the southern indigenous people are more refined than those of the northern indigenous people, but they are still thatched huts. The children standing outside the house wear short, Han-style clothes. The men wear short skirts, and the women wear colorful wide belts. Therefore, the northern indigenous people are more cultured and wealthier.</p>
<p>(9) Indigenous people's dancing. All tribes love to dance even more than civilized people. Taiwan's indigenous tribes are no exception. They only dance during festivals and gatherings.
