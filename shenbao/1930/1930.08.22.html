<p>國内之反對黨每因國家有不利事件藉以攻擊政府此各國之所同也然以平心論之有爲政府之失職而國家因以蒙不利者攻擊之者國人必表同情也有爲時勢所迫而成或爲歷史所積留而成則此一政府如是應付即易一政府應付亦復如是攻擊之者雖明知非政府應付不當之罪然而因爲地位不同責任所在自亦可以攻擊而在國人對之認爲政黨間之關係未必眞能表同情於攻擊者也即如英國保守黨因印度騷動事件攻擊工黨政府不遺餘力即此類也</p>
<p>原夫印度人民之要求自立不自工黨執政而始矣受英人之壓已久而憤而出此而英國政府對付印人反抗亦仍用極嚴厲之手段即保守黨而執政亦不過如是其所異者惟以西門氏之調查委員爲保守黨執政時所成立工黨内閣不許其參加圓桌會議以爲卑屈愚蠢實則圓桌會議能否饜印人之願而减輕印人之反抗尚在不可必之數安見西門氏參加而即爲有效哉然則邱吉爾氏之放言亦不過盡其在野黨之常態而定其對付印度事件之黨否也</p>

<h3 id="c116">比國兩大博覽會略紀（上） <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>比利時國土至小。以前時而屬奥。時而屬法。時至一八三○年革命成功。始獨立成爲一國。但歐戰時期又爲德軍佔據四年之久。及後協約國方面勝利。始得復國。今歲恰逢立國百年紀念。比人刼後痛定思痛。愈覺獨立之難而可貴。故舉國慶賀。特於里也支Liege與安威斯Anvers兩處大城舉行萬國博覽會。由五月起至十一月止。於歡祝獨立之餘。可以觀摩各國文化。吸引世界遊賓。於其國實業經濟各方面造福不渺。此博覽會之由來也。</p>
<p>茲先言里也支之博覽會。里也支爲比利時大工業城市之一。居Meuse與Ourthe兩河交匯處。交通發達。商務繁盛。此次博覽會分南北兩部。北部較大。佔地十四萬平方米突。即位於Meuse河傍。法意日本波蘭瑞士等均自建堂皇美麗之大陳列館於此。中國則於各小國及比國各公司行家等所合建之一總陳列館中佔一小亭焉。</p>
<p>綜觀各國出品。除中國埃及等一二落後國家外。大都係化學工藝産物及機器製造品。各種機件陳列尤多。此蓋近代文明國家致富致强之利器也。惟中國埃及則全保持十五六世紀原狀。一切出品多用手工做成。以云精美固矣。然而如時間人力之不經濟何。現在國家强弱之差。文野之别。全視其國民能製造機器與能運用機器與否。故觀博覽會出品即可知其國家盛衰狀况。</p>
<p>此次里也支博覽會性質本注重科學及其適用。大實業。農業及社會經濟各方面（Les　Scicnceset　LeursApplications'Ia　Grande　Industrie'I'Agriculture　et　I'Economie　sociale）。我國可以陳列之物本已不多。而此次大概因經濟關係。又未盡量陳列。故形似古玩店之中國亭中内容甚爲貧乏。紗羅綢緞爲我國唯一國産。似可搜集其質地最佳。花紋色彩最艶麗者廣爲陳列。該會不知何故僅有杭綢五六疋。且不甚美。反之如徽墨湖筆。中國線裝書之類。西人見之。莫明其妙。反紛紛陳列。亦可異矣。</p>
<p>出中國亭而至日本館。便使吾人目光一變。不能不歎服日人辦事之力。宣傳之巧。規模宏大。固不論矣。且日人稔知西人心理。一切出品全以適用爲目的。陳列之物旣富於近代色彩。陳列之法又合乎科學原理。故使西人流連歎賞。贊不絶口。絲綢本我國名産。乃日人陳列者反十倍於</p>
<p>南部會塲較小。出品多含敎育性質。如市政。農事等。陳列模型。圖模。標本至夥。又有美術館陳列古代東南部比利時之美術（I、Art　Wallon　Ancien）記者默念倘中國亭移設在古代美術館中。則庶幾無大遜色焉。</p>
<p>以上言里也支之博覽會旣畢。以下再述安威斯博覽會之大概。我。且加以油繪農婦採桑製繭等圖。使西人知絲之由來。其於剌繡等亦然。總之。日人於表現其國特色之外。又努力於歐洲社會救一共通點。即合乎現代人之需用是也。日人絶未陳列一物如徽墨湖筆之類。於西人毫無用處者。蓋日人在博覽會之目的。不重在表揚古玩式之國粹。而重在國際商業之宣傳也。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>遊梵爾賽宫Versaelles（三）</p>
<p>是的。假使中國有一天要畫這類的歷史畫。我的主張是漢高祖明太祖的事蹟固然要注意。而秦始皇的魄力。隋煬帝的天才。元太祖的威武是更其值得誇張的。本來嚴正的歷史是應該拿歷史的人物做標準所以這法國的紫光閣「梵爾賽宫「是將英主。暴君。學者。詩人。的圖象事蹟都在其列。我繼續講我們的游覽罷。走進又一殿。劈面就感到一股彩流的剌戟。唔。仿彿是吕班士Rubens特拉克窪的畫。走前去仔細看時。的確是一幅特拉克窪Delacroix的巨製。歐洲人稱爲浪漫派的獅子的特拉克窪。他是具有多方面的才能的。他那强烈的色彩。熱情的表現。以一人之力。就將浪漫主義所要走的路一直走到頂點的。最早以阿剌伯人上畫的怕是特拉克窪吧。這裏的大壁畫。也是畫着法國人征服摩洛哥的歷史。前景的人物多變而强烈的色調。悲痛的感情的表出那和諧的奏節。如演劇般的感人。東方風物藻飾的戰爭畫。到這一幅恐怕已經到了終極的純化的境地了。在那邊别有一幅征摩洛哥圖。約九丈長。摩洛哥王穿着黄衣張着黄傘。轍亂旗靡。伏尸遍野。殺戮之慘。描寫盡致。我們看了他頗有所感的。使那樣的屠殺弱小民族。也决不是大法國歷史的光榮吧。一張拿破侖自俄出走圖。大雪遍地。烏黑的捲雲。氣象慘慘。拿氏臥枕于一卒之手。像歷史上的這怪傑已走入末路似的。我們看了也不覺同聲一歎。一幅拿破侖助意戰奥奏凱還宫圖。一幅一八三二年法與荷蘭戰圖。一幅拿破侖第三戰意圖。可是我們終覺得這些戈戟森森。戰地慘慘的畫。終是缺少藝術上的深味似的。所經各殿。戰畫無數。不可勝錄也。這閎麗絶倫的宫苑。是萬國人衆游覽的勝地。所以法國人將他們的偉大的人物和事蹟。畫壁于是。以顯示他們歷史的榮光。在這里。我忽然想到日本人的善于仿摹。不必誰一切政治和學術的竭力學摹着歐人。那所謂明治神宫的四十幾張壁畫。也就像梵爾賽宫一部分小模型似的。再穿過數殿是戲院。文石爲地。畫飾窮蓋。周環廂樓。五色文石爲柱。彫鏤極精。舞臺破風都是石刻飾金。壞麗極了。後台高大無比。上部猶懸佈景數十幅相傳路易十四的時候便每天演劇于此。以娱貴族諸侯的。我們踏進這戲院時。仿彿立刻就感到官能的愉快。這樣子。更令我感到那享樂的君主的奢侈生活中。却有促進藝術的興盛之偉力。</p>

<p>離奇變幻如在五里霧中</p>
<p>狂進鋭退直似兎起鶻落</p>
<p>似乎趨向軟的方面走　昨（廿一日）標金市况、異常離奇、倐起倐落、時有二三兩盤旋、以爲常事、幾有迅雷不及掩耳、人心迷亂、殊無把握、風波汹惡、統市共計十兩差額、旋轉於五百四十兩以内、而趨勢萎軟也、外匯時有紛歧、終則平庸、與隔昨並不懸殊、場内買賣、恒見活潑、若泰康潤益餘源盛等大致售出、信亨恒興等紛向納進、自前市初因銀價見長、即開低盤、曾一度破進三十兩關口、復後買戶旣逞孔殷、當即上騰、飛騰十兩、幾將躍至四十兩關口、復後兎起鶻落、竟有五六兩迴顧、顚泊靡常、似墮五里霧中、迨午後益餘元茂永等復已追購、泰康潤順利等則見脱售、而匯票由頽轉平、茲已市氣轉弱爲堅、計有六七兩之曲折、厥後以在三十七兩之間、惟現貨烚赤因市上存底不旺、故價甚昻、照期標竟須遞增十七八兩有奇、前途尚有續漲可能、至昨大條銀雖縮八分之一、惟銀價反長四分之一、</p>
<p>晨初極盡變幻之能　十月份金價開盤五百卅六兩三錢、計隆一兩二錢、毛盤互有一二兩上下、旋後源成售出、一蹶七八兩、卒降爲二十九兩、迨先令揭佈勿動、且由晋安信亨等買進、遂跳至三十五六兩、繼爲三十七兩、復抑小兩餘、惟匯市尚穩、十一月美金由麥行三井售與三菱計四十元零二五、安達吃進十月英金七辨士九三七五、更由恒興落手而進、故乂提增三兩、迨十點左右計達三十九兩、至後某投機家由某號代爲出售、爲數甚多、並以泰康潤等相繼追賣、一刹時暴落八兩、十點半爲三十一兩、往後匯市易堅、住友東方互做十月份先令七辨士八七五、大通華比對做下月美金四十元零一八七五、良以大連帮買進、茲已扶摇上升、計哄起六七兩、惟間有二兩之起仆、十一點零爲三十八兩、復後似見軟化之態、但徬徨不定、由三十四兩加至三十七兩、迨正午三十五兩八錢收盤、</p>
<p>後市在三十兩關外盤旋　下午開市三十四兩半、嗣後大連帮售出、即行下游、僅計三十兩零六錢、二點一刻後志豐永·恒興·益餘等紛紛爭買、遂加四五兩、元茂永等隨之購進、且同業中曾結先令、計十月份初爲八辨士、旣而安達等售出七辨士八七五、至三點左右爲三十七兩八錢、時又回落一兩餘、計三十六兩、四點後買者不怠、重見七兩七八錢、最後抑至六兩六七錢、迨四點三十分收盤計三十六兩八錢、比諸前天計降七錢</p>
<p>掉期又抬高十一兩　查全日最大價三十九兩、最小價二十九兩、相去十兩、揭價計六百十兩零二錢、初撳七十四五兩、至七十一兩、復見七十八九兩、午收計抑小七十四兩、午後計抑小七十五六兩至八十兩、結果七十三四兩登賬四十七兩至三十六兩、補水四十七八兩掉期又見抬高、照交易所掛牌計十一兩、惟同業中竟做十五六兩之多、物品早市六兩二錢、午收五兩半、下午四兩半、收市七兩一錢</p>

<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市仍爲七錢三分、與前日相同、午市微小一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分九厘八毫七忽半、形勢尚稱穩固、去胃亦屬有限、（銀拆）早午兩市仍開二分、市氣寛鬆如常、劃頭依舊無價可開、銀行掛牌亦不掛出、</p>

<p>大盤微有上落</p>
<p>閘北　昨日各路到船不多、走銷極淡、北粳甚靜、緣頂貨仍在二十一元之列、而普通與次者價略有修削、但新鮮者貨客曾欲喊高、故粳價微有上落、交易則屬凋零也、東新粳廠方雖欲扳售、然買戶似勿急進、趨勢沉寂、大盤與前日相彷、惟高次貨品升降上漸有一兩角之出入、新客尖來源見接、去胃尚可、市形看軟、變元漲勢已定、買氣亦平、故市形堅穩而已、</p>
<p>滬南　河下來源寥寥、街銷因貨稀不見開展、常帮破粳稀而少交、蘇同機粳雖略有應市、大都平淡之象、南帮簿稻到銷兩微、價無榮辱、頂貨仍爲二十一元、白元此間貨極枯薄、吊銷微有問津、行情挺定、</p>

<p>昨日洋米仍無大帮去化、市形依然疲滯、更因湘米定期開禁、已成事實、而報上亦載及九月一日開禁、定額五百萬包、每包收照費五元云云、滬上存米雖少、然以銷化呆滯、久呈疲木不振、倘此湘米大批來申、市面定受鉅大影響、惟尚有問題者、湘米能否有五百萬運出、此數是否全數裝申、加上護照費及一切雜税運費之後、能否販運合划、因此滬上米市、尚未受有鉅大摇動、祗人心疑懼、進戶更爲觀望而已、西貢一號米申地存底較多、去化較呆昨因湘米開禁消息、市價立即續跌三角、其他各米均爲帶小數分至一角不等、計售一號西貢二百包、價十六元至十六元三角、安東更七百五十包、價十六元五角七分、大紋五百包、價十二元三角半至三角、敏黨三百包、價十四元九角至三角七分云、</p>

<p>津埠發水其存底或受影響</p>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、以買氣依然甚寂、故洋麥報價、雖回起四五角、人心仍不甚佳、不過本月份之市氣、已較堅勁耳、迨至下午開盤、初仍平定、旋聞天津發水、秋糧恐受影響因此人心忽昻、近遠期之買氣、亦突見暢盛、較前日均好起一分零、觀粉市前途、最大之癥結、終須廠家放出籌碼、然後方有較巨之鬆動、本月份已呈僵局、無論如何、終難重落到五錢關内也、結果八九月各漲一分、十·十二·一月份漲一分二厘半、十一月份漲一分半、</p>

<p>昨日期麥開盤後、各月份盤旋中又趨堅定、因洋麥報價略好、而本月份因大戶多頭、始終擯住、因價值過廉、即預備收貨、否則尚思逐步了結也、結果八·十一·十二月份不動、九月份好一分、十二月份大二分、現麥因廠家一致擯住、故各路船車麥均無做開、全市祗硤石船麥開一百五十包、價四兩七錢七分云、</p>

<p>自協助會停辦貢熙茶後、茶市突起重大之變化、英法茶商對於路莊土莊各綠茶、均乘機抑價、認盤益加苛緊、華茶商對於此種情勢、堅持力亦頓趨薄弱、昨開出珍眉市盤又跌五兩、且交易稀少、人心疲軟、大勢日趨衰頽、惟漢口被捕俄商、現下雖未釋放、中政府對於俄行辦茶、仍允繼續保護、稍緩時日、俄莊仍有開辦之望云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一·一五六二五、比前電回跌三一二五、紐約期糖九月份價一·一二、十二月份一·二一、明年三月份一·三二、五月份一·四0、比前電各跌一分、獨十二月份比跌二分、爪哇期現糖價均無升降、公會粗砂白買氣殊寥、出戶轉湧、喊價七兩九錢半、迄乏問津、致全市均無成交、磨細砂白八兩零二分半、進出亦懈、日糖以廠盤轉鬆、十十一月份交貨、明治廠糖突開二萬包、價日金四元八角、較之大里糖價廉二角、且以日來東匯轉賤、故行方進意頗濃、旋即售通、惟現貨劃盤市氣、因之略平、交易寥落、TY嘜七兩七錢七分半、N嘜七兩八錢七分半、餘嘜未有成交、</p>

<p>公盤亦難保持</p>
<p>黑胡椒前因産價暴跌、更兼客銷寥落、致市一瀉千里、日趨下游、號家開盤、自七十五兩、步跌至五十兩關内、後爲受虧太重、乃由行號兩方互訂公盤、以維市面、藉保成本、故市盤得以回漲至五十七八兩之間、但客帮去化仍滯、供過於求、存貨日厚、且産價續跌不已、洋行貨又蜂湧而來、公盤勢難保持、市乃大跌而特跌、昨有日興洋行開售一號椒一百五十包、價四十三兩半、行方進胃、異常淡薄、聞售脱之數尚不及半、市之萎弱、已至極點、比較上週市盤、計跌十四五兩、而跌風之猛、誠所罕聞也、</p>

<h3 id="c165">中美航運競爭過烈 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>共有四國商輪一百十二艘</p>
<p>釀成船多貨少與噸位過剩</p>
<p>今年中美航路内、各國輪公司、對於中國出口貨運輸營業、其競爭之烈、爲自來所無、英日美三國航商、尤趨入短兵相接之一途、茲將近日、激爭狀况分記如下、</p>
<p>新船續到　自日郵社在太平洋内添造六快輪後、繼之而起者、爲大阪公司亦造六艘强速度巨船、英商昌興、特建空前巨輪日皇后號、美商大來所造之兩巨船、不久亦可先落成一艘、日郵社之第五新船日枝丸、與氷川輪爲姊妹船、准定明日開頭班、而大班之第二號新輪東海丸、亦趕工造就、昨得電訊、二十四日可以至滬、二十六日開處女班赴美、英商保和洋行之紐約班輪、亦改用摩托機輪立吕城號行駛、本年中美綫新增之船、共有二十三艘、約計三十萬噸、</p>
<p>營業互爭　各新船開班後、爭以海行速快爲號召、而攬運出口之中國去貨、於絲茶兩項競載尤烈、致已跌之價、殊無增漲之望、而雜貨内之不甚繁多者、又各跌價爲爭裝之資、如芝蔴每噸自四元減至二元五角、餘貨則跌去百分之三十、與歐洲航路在金漲後之增加水脚、適成一反比例、日來中美綫内各輪公司、在跌價後又復暗放運費、因競爭過烈、而互相嫉忌、舉凡貨物運價、以至貨物船單、禁止洩漏、如辦事人員有將水脚價出口貨等眞相告人者、即須罰金千元、而同業詢問更爲疑忌、此行彼效、中美貨運、今日已變成一諱莫如深之局面矣、</p>
<p>船多貨少　中美一綫船隻日增、而去貨日少、（一）以中國内地交通阻滯、受時局之影響、出口貿易不振、（一）以有限之貨、供無限之輪競運、自然釀成噸位過剩之勢、查上海赴紐約班輪、在前每星期祗有一輪開出、今增至五班、在舊金山西雅圖綫、昔僅兩船者、今亦增至四班、致成目前之船尤多貨尤少、縱使放盤跌價、而其如無貨供運何、故今年中美班輪、幾無一不蒙虧耗者、苟常此相爭、則中美海運</p>

<p>、必致同遭破産也、</p>

<p>僱流氓大打出手　聞走狗等、此次會商結果、僱用流氓一百人、每人每工給洋十元、專事毆打工人中之領袖、及工整會委員、同時紛赴工人住處、威嚇工人無條件上工、</p>

<h3 id="c216">黑人的戲劇 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 楊昌溪</p>
<p>黑人除了音樂外、在藝術中最能表示出他們强烈的民族意識的、便要算在繪畫和戲劇了、</p>
<p>在繪畫中他們還没有獨立的能力、因爲繪畫便是貴族的東西、没有充分的經濟和優裕的時間的練習是不成功的、所以、即使他們有所成就、而實際上還是擺脱不了白人的勢力、</p>
<p>除了過去在法國居留的黑人曾間常有過繪畫的出品展覽外、在美國方面便要算那一羣爲一種學會的資助和奬勵培植出來的幾個青年作家了、不過、他們在繪畫的表現力根本便薄弱、除了把游蕩的黑人或賣唱的一切作爲題材以表現黑人的生活外、在繪畫上的民族意識便没有其他文學的成熟了、</p>
<p>在戲劇上他們因爲對於創製脚本的技能比較的薄弱、所以、在演劇上的成績是勝過劇作家的工作、所以在美國無論何種劇團中却有黑人的份子、一面他們具有演劇的天才、一面、要表現近代黑人的生活和痛苦、非他們不行了、所以、在美國劇本的題材有好多是以黑人爲背景的、因爲在美國的實生活中不能擺脱黑人、而黑人的低級生活是美國文明之所以達到蓬勃的成員、</p>
<p>在演劇家兼導演家中最著名的要推保羅·魯濱遜、（Paul　Robinson）非惟在黑人中要推第一個傑出人才、即是在美國的戲劇史中也是當代聞名的、最著名的是他對於"Othells"一劇的排演、自從在英國和巴黎成功後、在美國的地位更增高了、他僅是一個三十五歲的青年、獨特的成功特别是他包含尼格羅尼族精神的唱歌和表情、因爲他是一個時代的幸運兒、曾經以演美國劇作家奥尼爾、（Eugene　O'nell）兩部劇而出名、曾經在拉提金士大學讀書、所以、他在演劇的技巧都很能把黑人底天才尖鋭的表出、</p>
<p>另外、在美國近年來盛行而且幾乎征服全世界的電影劇、也擺脱不了黑人的勢力、除了在劇材中和演員上採取黑人外、而且他們還有完全以黑人作導演和扮演的組織、最著名的「大閲兵」（TheBig　Pauade）底創造者凡都（kingVidor）的純黑人主演的片子阿里路亞（Helleluah）是引起了美國和德國的騷動、爲着要在阿里路亞中完全貼眞描寫黑人的生活起見、凡都特别親自到美國南部底黑人區域去挑選絶好的演員、所有的一切面貌、姿態、歌曲和跳舞、和羣衆的意識、都能十足的表出黑人民族底全生命、所以、在美國文明的三大要素的音樂（"Gazz"）中黑人注入了他們民族底血、使美國的國民音樂完全帶了黑人的色彩、現在黑人雖不能征服代表美國近代文明的電影、但是在電影上的作風是不能逃脱黑人的背景、</p>
<p>在劇本的製作上、因爲時代的關係、他們的成功便没在小說和詩歌中的偉大、多半是簡單的描寫黑人生活的製作、而且因爲在黑人特有的英語中旣經略語、土語繁多之外、又兼以外國語的滲合、在上演上是難於得着黑人以外的觀者的同情和了解了、只有在黑人特有的劇塲上排演、在題材上是可以作爲喚醒民族覺醒的工具、</p>
<p>不過、在黑人戲劇的發展過程中、最值得注意的是美國的黑人中在一九二六年以「募工者」（Cnuter）獨幕劇獲得「機會雜誌」（Opportunrty）戲劇奬金的馬惹士（Gonathan　Matheus）、和以「羽毛」（plunes）獲得該雜誌一九二七年戲劇第一狀的約翰生（Ceorgia　Douglas　Johnson）爲著名了、</p>
<p>在「羽毛」中、他很深刻的横寫出一個女子得病的悲慘、那是一個人的悲劇、並不是關於黑人的、不過在短短的獨幕劇中充盈着使人不得不同情的感情罷了</p>
<p>但是在「募工者」便不同了、雖然也是短短的獨幕劇、却能深深的表示出在林肯釋放黑奴後、他們的生活還是不能不受制於變相的奴隸生活、七十三歲的典型保姆的祖母只有在生活不好時唱着、「没有人知道我曾遇着的困苦、只有耶穌知曉……」而爲孫子的二十三歲的尼格羅青年爲着生活不得不承認北方軍器廠募工者的需求、因爲募工的白人對青年說、「别要失落你一生的好機會、有好工錢、有好的事業等着你、」而且他能使祖母的生活安穩、使妻子漂亮、所以他不得不承認了、</p>
<p>總之、黑人藝術中的民族意識的表現是一天比一天的尖鋭化、要想恢復他們的大亞非利加、非在藝術中含蓄民族性的興奮劑不可、</p>
<h3 id="c217">紀念詩人黄震遐 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 秋原</p>
<p>前天傅彦長兄偶然報告我黄震遐底近况不知下落、并且說、黄震遐出征前方、生死未卜、在同這位不幸的詩人黄震遐稍爲有點認識的、一定不期然而然會表示無限的同情、連想到人生如寄·命運難違底感傷的·唏嘘的情緒、昨天盧夢殊兄到我家裏來又談起黄震遐的事、我們談起了又不禁彼此感傷一下、黄震遐、黄震遐何處是、</p>
<p>今天是星期日、隨申報附送的申報圖畫週刊第一頁上、刊着「中央敎導第二師騎兵於八月一日在浦口車站候車赴前綫」底攝影、從那糢糊暗淡的寫眞版上、我們看見騎在馬上戎裝的青年、他的瘦小的身材、清秀的顔面、豈是我們的詩人黄震遐最後的留影嗎、</p>
<p>這一種、那一種、渺杳晞嘘的情緒、使我們感覺到人生的變幻、命運底險惡、　　我們今日紀念我們的詩人黄震遐、雖則或者有早一點之嫌、黄震遐雖則或不致於有會像我們所想像到的遭遇、但單是這一點片段的不幸的消息、已經足使我們心有所感的了、</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>本刊的讀者、許還不致於忘記我們的詩人、黄震遐、在過去本刊曾刊載過他的許多關於藝術歷史、及文化的文字、他的有力的文筆、健動的思想、美麗的詞句、許還會在一般讀者的記憶、今天我們所紀念的、正就是這個我們的詩人、本刊的至友、黄震遐、</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>這已是三年前的事了、在一個秋天、在那被稱爲「神秘之街」的北四川路上、在粤南酒樓、在一間小小的房間内、充满了十幾個人、在這里、我初次遇到了我們的詩人、他的清秀的顔面、瘦小的身材、清脆的北京話、温文的舉動、一望而知是個世家子、同座中他是最年輕、最沈默、</p>
<p>他是個歷史底學生、藝術底學生、還有、他是個詩人、</p>
<p>不幸的事件是這樣開始的、他的母親兩年前患了盲腸炎謝了世、賸了我們的詩人與他的妹妹、大都會的煩囂、愈會使寂寞的人感到寂寞、漂零的人感到漂零、就在這個時候、我們看見在「藝術界」「雅典」等各種刊物内有他的詩歌、他的文章、</p>
<p>在雅典月刊内、黄震遐發表了許多新詩、他的詩篇、具有雄偉的、英壯的、及豪放的氣度—在我們的新詩壇内、可以算爲獨樹一幟、無與倫比的了、從這些、那些、他所遺留下來的詩篇、這已經是事實了、黄震遐是我們的詩人、他的詩雄狀不亞於拜輪、但他在中國詩壇内所取得的地位—僅僅是我們的詩人、我們的拜輪而已、詩人底成就、也何曾是天才、運命實是支配着的、</p>
<p>黄震遐又是個民族主義者、在「藝術界」内所發表的關於藝術的論文、充满了豐富的健全的民族思想、他是個民族主義的文藝底前驅、不但發表了關於民族文藝底論文、同時、他又是個民族文藝底創造者、實行者、他所遺留下來的許多詩歌、與小說、不盡充满了雄偉的豪放的氣質、且食了多量的民族色彩、是我們民族主義的文藝底典型的代表的劇作、</p>
<p>民族的熱情、英雄的懷抱、與現實的悲哀、使我們的詩人加入了中央軍官政治學校、我們正希望着這是他的生命底開端底曙光、但是因爲中原的亂事、我們的詩人、不得不蹈上了征車、開向前敵去、他是在騎兵隊内、在歸德方面的戰塲上、歸德一役、我們的詩人也許在陣亡的許多名單中、這是時勢、這許是我們的詩人底收塲、</p>
<p>我們的詩人有難言的漂泊的身世、他遺下了一個妹妹、現由張若谷兄代爲留養、身前與朱應鵬、傅彦長、盧夢殊、等最爲友善、他是廣東籍的上海人、存年二十有一、</p>

<p>— 伽</p>
<p>盧夢殊主編</p>
<p>文華美術圖書印刷公司出版</p>
<p>這眞慚愧、中國人對於電影這一種藝術—新興底藝術好像隔了一層厚幕似地完全不認識的、雖則說、中國也有所謂國産影片、它的歷史算起來已經有了十八個年頭（從民二到現在）、然而、中國的所謂國産影片也者、祗亦不過如胡蘆依樣底「畫裏眞、呼之欲出」底把男女和景物印在膠片之上給舶來品多一筆銷塲而已、電影是甚麽、他們還是完全不懂、因爲他們所懂的、在觀者方面、祗不過是「畫裏眞眞、呼之欲出」而已、在攝製者方面祗不過如走馬燈之類畫裏有活躍的形態的一種新鮮—時髦—底可以哄小孩子騙鄉曲的大銅鈿的營業品而已、甚麽電影藝術的中心意識、實際上、他們—觀者與攝製者—還是茫然、還是一點也不懂、</p>
<p>爲着這一點也不懂的原故、中國的所謂國産影片就不曉得成甚麽東西、並且畸形得可怕了、這並不是我有意在這裏來挖苦中國的所謂國産影片的觀者們和攝製者們、這實在是十幾年來已昭示在我們的眼前的一件事實、</p>
<p>盧夢殊先生便是對於這一點最用力攻擊的一人、他在他過去的工作的十八期「銀星」中很顯著地給我們見到、而今、他又作算再度衝鋒了、又有了出其全力確定了宗旨的「電影」月刊出現了、</p>
<p>我們該得感謝他擁戴他如此努力地聨絡一班作家在這時代上對於電影的範圍内有這偉大的貢獻、對於中國的所謂國産影片的攝製者們有這誠懇地啓示與誘勸、尤其在態度上對於「電影」月刊的讀者的這麽的誠懇、</p>
<p>他在「電影」月刊第二期的編輯後話裏說、「在我初定本刊的編輯計劃、是要成功它成爲一本各方面完備的刊物、但是、現在可不能了、因爲、在思想動摇的現在、青年們都感到了彷徨、假使一本時代的刊物裏不一致地而刊載着矛盾的言論、是會使青年讀者們受到了迷惑的、那末、後患正是無窮、而編者便等於禍首了、」</p>
<p>他又說、「我打算在第四期的本刊裏出「民族主義電影運動專號」、來呌起人們認識這一件新興藝術的意識中心、我想、這是我對於我們民族應該做的事、」</p>
<p>不錯、提倡民族主義、這是對於我們民族應該做的事、而且、在這民族苦難</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>的時代、文藝没落的時代、「民族主義」的提倡、是對於我們民族應該先做的一件最爲重要而很緊急的事、因爲我們中國當前的危機就是民衆没有民族意識、散沙似的一堆完全没有整個的力的團結、對内不能一致團結、對外不能禦强寇、所謂「人爲刀爼、我爲魚肉、」全國的民衆、像散沙似的一堆、没有民族意識、便没有整個的力團結、旣然没有整個的力的團結、我們民族和國權便就如山東人買驢子肉的驢子一般給人要那一塊就割那一塊了、我們中國有了這麽一個當前的危機、我們就該責任地趕緊起來努力於民族的目决、這便就是「民族主義」、</p>
<p>我們提倡「民族主義」、當然是從文藝做起、因爲這樣才能夠確定了思想的中心、這樣才能夠挽回文藝的没落、這樣才能夠使全民衆認識了、民族意識而至於有整個的力的團結以達到自决時期、電影旣是藝術中的新興者、那末在一本電影的刊物内就應該提倡「民族主義」、誠然如蘆夢殊先生所說、「這是我對於我們的民族應該做的事、」</p>
<p>果然　盧夢殊先生眞的應該做志來了、就是、把「原定的編輯計劃根本推翻、而歸納于思想的一致、」這就是說、他給我們見到的已在他所主編的「电影」月刊第三期裏了、他在第三期的「電影」月刊裏、第一枝箭就是射向製片者的心頭、在「我們的說話」裏話—</p>
<p>本不是求正於明達、也不是求欣賞於智識階級中人、祇開映時在報紙上吹一吹法螺、騙一騙無知婦孺、閧一閧低層社會、賺了錢再做、做了再想法子賺錢、總要有法可想、不妨一續再續以至十餘續、這又是中國電影家的慣技、也是中國電影的不二法門、</p>
<p>電影雖則是企業之一、但總是藝術、不能隨便給人拿來做騙錢的幌子、更不能隨便給人拿來愚詐無知、提倡腐化、不幸中國電影家竟然犯了這兩個毛病、……</p>
<p>十幾年來老是初衷不變、遂成今日中國電影的没落時期、</p>
<p>盧先生一向都是大胆說話的、而在這一篇說話裏尤其嚴正不阿、並且針針見血、然而、中國電影所以没落總也有個理由、所以、他又說—</p>
<p>「總之、這全然是因爲思想失却了中心、文化没有了出路、以致凡是藝術都入了没落的時期……」</p>
<p>是啊、因爲思想失却中心、文化没有了出路、以致凡是藝術都入了没落的時期、故不祇電影爲然、其他的也是如此、所以、「如果我們文藝家不急起直追地把這重大的責任勉力負起、一輩子實不能挽回這危機、」然而、這重大的責任又怎樣地勉力負起呢、喲、盧先一在「我們對於電影藝術應有的認識」文裏告訴給我們了—</p>
<p>在今日、在今日中國苦難的時代、我們該抛樂棄個已而爲全民族奮鬥的戰士、人的意志是求生、我們中國人、應該有爲全民族而求生的意志、」</p>
<p>「民族主義」的文藝運動在是在各人不同的之塲上而取一致的行動以努力力於工作的、即從文學家·音樂家·和其他的藝術家集合起來集中精神、團結力量、努力於「民族主義文藝運動、」</p>
<p>爲了這、盧先生便要「我們對於電影藝應有的認識了、這「我們對於電影藝術應有的認識就是要求我們的電影從事者今日的新生、今日的新生、就是放棄以前對於電影認識的錯誤而醒覺過來而重新的有正確的認識、這種重新的正確的認識便就是藝術思想中心「民族主義、」</p>
<p>這本第三期的「電影」月刊、關於「民族主義」的提倡、是不遺餘力的、在這裏說敢說不了許多、編者對於同胞的體格上的期望的顯著之點、尤其使人擁戴、他在第二頁上說、「國産影片、在女性方面、已經使人見到了成功、……但是、時代底要求、是要充份地具着男性美的、又在第四十五頁上說、「在這民族復興運動的時期中、我們須要特别注意於民族的是活潑堅毅的精神、和健全的體格、因爲有了這兩者才能夠有抵抗及一切作爲的力量、是民族當中一個急切的需求、」</p>
<p>至於這本刊物排法的新穎、取材的優良、圖照的精美與及趣味的濃厚、我敢說在電影刊物中、是獨一無二的、但是、我在把這第三期讀完了之後、還希望盧先生早些把第四期「民族主義電影運動專號出版、</p>

The rebel troops on the Jinpu Railway are absolutely no longer a problem. The recapture of Dezhou is not far off. Currently, passenger and freight trains on the Jinpu Railway only run as far as Yanzhou because several bridges north of Yanzhou have been destroyed, so it will take some time to repair them.

On the Longhai front, the rebel troops are now fleeing in disarray to the area of Qi County and Taikang, and our troops are pursuing them closely. Lanfeng can be recaptured soon.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the protection of foreign nationals along the Yangtze River, authorities from various countries generally believe that the period from the end of October will be a low water season, and destroyers and gunboats will not be able to reach Changsha directly. The British side knows that it will be impossible to protect the foreign nationals in Changsha during the low water season and has decided to temporarily relocate the British nationals and consulate in Changsha from the end of October until the next spring's high water season. It has advised British nationals to temporarily leave Changsha during the low water season. The American side also intends to advise its nationals to leave the country. For example, the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company has voluntarily closed. Japan is currently using the gunboat "Otaka" to protect Japanese nationals in the Changsha area.

<h3 id="e10">Churchill Attacks the Labour Government Over Indian Affairs <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>It is common in all countries for opposition parties to seize upon unfavorable events in the nation to attack the government. However, to be fair, if the government's dereliction of duty leads to harm to the nation, such attacks will naturally garner sympathy from the people. If the situation arises from circumstances or accumulates historically, any government would handle it similarly. Even if the attackers know that the government is not to blame, they can still attack due to their different positions and responsibilities. However, the people may not necessarily sympathize with the attackers, recognizing it as a political maneuver. This is exemplified by the British Conservative Party's relentless attacks on the Labour government over the Indian unrest.</p>
<p>The Indian people's demand for independence did not begin with the Labour Party's rise to power. They have long been oppressed by the British and have risen in anger. The British government's response to Indian resistance has been extremely harsh. The Conservative Party, if in power, would likely act similarly. The only difference is that the Simon Commission of Inquiry was established during the Conservative Party's reign. The Labour cabinet did not allow it to participate in the Round Table Conference, deeming it cowardly and foolish. In reality, it is uncertain whether the Round Table Conference can satisfy the wishes of the Indian people and reduce their resistance. It is unclear whether the Simon Commission's participation would have been effective. Therefore, Churchill's remarks are merely fulfilling the usual role of an opposition party and asserting his party's opposition to how the Indian situation is being handled.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Compilation of Military Reports from Various Sources <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Military reports from various sources on the 21st: (1) In the vicinity of Zhengzhou and Xuchang, due to continuous heavy rain and flash floods, a large number of the enemy have died. Feng Yuxiang, Sun Chu, Lu Zhonglin, and others have returned to Shijiazhuang by special train to discuss a general retreat plan with Yan Xishan. For the sake of a permanent solution, the Central Army has decided to pursue them closely. (2) The enemy facing the Longhai Railway have launched continuous attacks. After our army's Hao Menglin Division repeatedly launched fierce attacks on Lema Village and Yuexiang Village, the enemy's momentum could not be sustained, and the entire line wavered. They have begun to retreat, and our army is currently pursuing them closely. (3) The 44th Division of the 10th Army's pursuit force has crossed Zhecheng, and the 48th Division has crossed Taikang and Qi County, pursuing the enemy towards Kaifeng. (4) The 7th Army's pursuit force is attacking towards Gong County and Luoyang from the area west of the railway. The vanguard has crossed Dengfeng and Mi County. (5) A telegram from Yanzhou states that after our central route army crossed the river, it has approached Yancheng. The enemy is actively building fortifications in the areas of Yucheng and Pingyuan, intending to hold firm, with Yucheng as the first line of defense and Pingyuan as the second line of defense. The defenders of Yancheng are part of Wang Jingguo's troops. Our rear troops are actively advancing. (6) In the Qingcheng and Qidong area, the enemy numbers approximately 15,000, and the enemy scattered near Feicheng numbers approximately 20,000. Lower-ranking officers unanimously advocate surrendering with their guilt rather than making unnecessary sacrifices. Negotiations for surrender have been underway in recent days. Our side plans to transport all of them to the rear for appropriate indoctrination. A portion will be organized into vanguard guides, a portion into transport teams, and another portion into special operations teams. (Special Dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic news: The Soviet Union has decided to abolish the provincial system and has set a deadline of September 15th of this year for its complete abolition. It is scheduled to be implemented within ten days after the start of the new fiscal year.

It will include the cities of Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Verkhneudinsk, Chita, Nerchinsk, and Sretensk, with Irkutsk as the location of the provincial government. It will be named the Eastern Siberian Region. The original Siberian Region will be renamed the Western Siberian Region, and the Far Eastern Region will be renamed the Pacific Region.

<p>Churchill Viciously Criticizes the Current Government</p>
<p>Anti-British Tribes Conspire to Launch Rebellion</p>
<p>Female Student Humiliated for Displaying National Flag</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 20th) Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchill, speaking in Canterbury today, predicted that the outcome of the Indian Round Table Conference would inevitably be chaotic and disruptive. Churchill vehemently criticized the Labour government, especially regarding its handling of the Indian situation, stating that the incursions of the Afridi tribes were a sign of the waning British authority in India. He further stated that the spirit of subversion from above, which has now thrown India into a state of turmoil, also seems to have undermined the effectiveness of military operations in North-West Frontier Province. He also called the exclusion of Sir John Simon from the Round Table Conference a despicable act of stupidity. In his view, the Round Table Conference is nothing more than a gathering hoping to placate the malicious agitator, Gandhi. The proposal to grant India dominion status will not pass even in the current session, he said. Churchill also spoke of the Egyptian situation, saying that continued external interference in Egyptian affairs seems to be creating an impossible situation, leading people to believe that external forces are trying to foment internal strife in Egypt, just as they would try to breed snakes in a zoo.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Simla, 20th) Official reports indicate that the situation in North-West Frontier Province has greatly improved. The Afridi tribes have dispersed, and there are no traces of anti-British tribes within the region. However, the situation with the Mohmand tribe is still of concern due to the activities of a charismatic leader.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Calcutta, 20th) Europeans in India today abandoned their usual political apathy and gathered at the New Empire Theatre to discuss two conflicting motions. The first motion, advocating the repeal of the 1919 Government of India Act and the restoration of the reformed system of 1909, received considerable support. The second was an official motion largely endorsing the Simon Report. Speakers expressed divided opinions, and judging by the number of raised hands, the second motion was clearly defeated. However, as the theatre performance was about to begin, there was no time to count the votes, so the meeting was adjourned until the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 20th) The two volumes of the Simon Report have sold a total of 45,000 copies since their release in June, including sales within India. They are still being sold. Such a sales figure for a book of this nature is considered a phenomenal success.</p>

<p>Minister of Finance Delivers Speech on Finances</p>
<p>Criticism from the Opposition Party</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 21st) The Constitutional Government Party, silent since the special session of parliament, has decided to launch a nationwide speaking tour to counter the activities of the opposition parties. The first major meeting was held today (20th) at the Hibiya Public Hall here. Finance Minister Inoue took the stage first, stating that the reasons for the recession were twofold: one, the global economic downturn, and two, Japan's unique circumstances. Japan's unique circumstances are due to the belated lifting of the gold embargo. After the Great War in Europe, countries around the world decisively lifted the gold embargo, entered an era of consolidation, and vigorously pursued the rationalization of various industries and the restructuring of businesses. Only Japan did not implement fiscal austerity, continuing its lax policy, fostering a national habit of extravagance, leading to the current recession. As a result of the current government's decisive lifting of the gold embargo at the beginning of this year, the exchange rate recovered to seven pounds sterling. At the same time, prices fell, production costs dropped, and exports were no longer unreasonable or uneven. However, the recession caused by global overproduction has recently struck suddenly, leading to a sharp decline in both exports and imports. This is unavoidable. However, domestic consumption has also declined, so production must be adjusted to cope with it. Currently, Japan's production capacity is excessive in many areas. Unreasonable competition among businesses is also commonplace. If left unchecked, the result will be mutual destruction. Therefore, it is necessary to regulate and restructure these businesses. Fortunately, funds are abundant today, and interest rates are low, making this an excellent opportunity for restructuring. Reversing policy to stop austerity would be detrimental in every way. It is true that adopting a proactive policy might create a temporary boom. But pursuing this temporary palliative policy would inevitably lead to a fall in government bonds, a loss of Japan's international credit, resulting in currency inflation, trade imbalances, and a steady outflow of cash, requiring another round of austerity. This would only plunge Japan's financial and business sectors into a permanently irrecoverable state. The most frightening thing for the financial world right now is the unfounded pessimism being spread by the public, causing a groundless sense of panic among the people. The most urgent task now is to dispel this fear. He emphasized the necessity of austerity at length. Later, Mr. Nakano spoke on various economic issues, and Mr. Nagai spoke on disarmament issues, each displaying their rhetorical skills. The meeting adjourned at ten o'clock.</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 21st) Seiyukai member Zenbei Horikiri commented on the Minister of Finance's speech, saying, "Every time Mr. Inoue opens his mouth, he claims that Japan's current plight is due to the global economic downturn. This is not true. It is the result of lifting the gold embargo. To lift the embargo amidst a global downturn is like making a sick man run a race, only worsening his condition. And the foolish policy of encouraging frugality has led to a sharp decline in exports, even more so than the decline in imports. Mr. Inoue's words might be acceptable if he were a technician in the gold standard. But Mr. Inoue has no understanding of the general public. Just look at the impoverished state of businesses, industries, and farmers, and you can see that Mr. Inoue's counter-measures are based on the law of the jungle. Mr. Inoue strongly advises against pessimism, but facing this unprecedented economic depression, who can avoid it? Those who are optimistic are probably only Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Finance Minister Inoue."</p>

<p>Turkey Considers Another Diplomatic Note for Negotiation</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Ankara, 20th) After Persia refused Turkey's proposal to jointly suppress the Kurdish rebels, the Turkish government remains optimistic about Turkish-Persian negotiations. Newspapers have also solemnly argued that since Persia has already expressed goodwill in suppressing the Kurdish tribes, there is no reason why the two countries should not agree on purely military matters that do not involve any political nature. Currently, Turkish President Kemal is in Yarova on the Bosphorus, while Prime Minister İsmet and Foreign Minister Ruştu have left the capital to meet with him to discuss another note to Persia.</p>

<p>German Representative Slandered, Declares Withdrawal</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Brussels, 20th) During the 12th General Assembly of the International Student Union, a major dispute arose again regarding the admission of the German Student Union. Previously, the German Student Union's request to join was rejected because it included students from the German ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia and the Free City of Danzig, which was deemed inconsistent with the articles of association that only recognize national entities. Currently, the German representative protested the President of the Assembly's refusal to allow him to respond to the speeches of the Polish and Czechoslovakian representatives, and the problem has been turned over to a nine-nation committee for review.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Brussels, 20th) The German student representative has left the annual conference of the International Student Union, announcing at the same time that the German Student Union would not join the organization because the French president, Mr. Sourrain, allowed Czech and Polish representatives to slander Germany, without giving the German representative an opportunity to respond. The Dutch representative then moved to censure the president, which is expected to cause a fierce debate, the result of which could lead to the dissolution of the Union. The student unions of Italy, Spain, and Hungary had already withdrawn from the organization before this incident.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Central Propaganda Department Receives the Press <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference in the Second Conference Hall of the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 21st, with over 20 reporters from various newspapers present. Chairman Zhang Tingxiu reported on three matters: (1) On the military front, progress on the Pinghan Railway has been rapid recently. Our forces have occupied Peicheng, west of Xuchang, and are currently advancing towards Gongxian. If Gongxian is occupied by our forces, the rear of Feng's army can be cut off. Feng's army on the Longhai Railway has gradually retreated since our army recovered Jinan. Although Feng's rebels are still trying to resist, they are not a cause for concern. As for Beijing, since Jinan was occupied by us, it has lost its last guarantee. However, the reactionary factions in Beijing, without any military certainty, are trying to quickly form a false government in order to deceive the public. This plan is not only impossible to realize but also extremely laughable. (2) Regarding public opinion in the North, recent investigations have shown that it is much clearer than before. However, there are still a few inaccurate observations. It is understandable that Beijing newspapers cannot speak freely under the oppression of warlords, but facts should not be erased. For example, after Jinan was recovered by the Central Government, a certain Tianjin newspaper, known for its neutrality, was vague in its language. This is truly disappointing. It is hoped that the press will faithfully represent public opinion in the future, and the Central Government will show sympathy and will not be overly critical. (3) The generals who recovered Jinan this time have made great achievements, and this victory is worthy of commemoration. Therefore, the Central Government has decided to send Commissioners Dai Jitao and Liu Jiwen to the front lines to express their condolences on behalf of the Central Government. The Central Propaganda Department has also printed a type of "Revolutionary Soldier's Diary" for the two Commissioners to take to the front lines and distribute to the officers and soldiers. After the report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Ge Jingen Travels West on the Same Train</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: After Jinan was recovered by the Central Army, personnel from the Shandong Provincial Party and Government agencies who had remained in Qingdao began to prepare to return to Jinan. However, due to the impact of military operations on the Jiaoji Railway, it was difficult to fully repair it for a while. Therefore, two plans were drafted: one for sending advance personnel for takeover and one for full departure. Later, the plan has been changed several times without being able to be realized. Yesterday, according to news from the Jiaoji Railway, the remaining Jin army between Zhoucun and Zhangdian had completely withdrawn towards Qingcheng, and the Zibo River iron bridge was nearing completion. Light vehicles can pass through, so the provincial agencies decided to return to Jinan this (18th) evening. The Railway Bureau prepared a special train, consisting of five cars: a dining car No. 351, a first and second-class car No. 215, for the use of personnel from the Provincial Party and Government agencies, a car No. 601, for the use of personnel from the Jinan Arsenal, and two cars No. 623 and 223, for the use of all personnel from the General Headquarters. All personnel returning to Jinan were issued symbols by the Provincial Government for identification. Local Qingdao Party and Government agencies and various organizations will go to the station to see them off. Because there were too many people from various agencies, the original number of cars was not enough, so a third-class car was temporarily added. The train will depart west at 3:00 AM tonight.</p>
<p>Also, after receiving a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Ge Jingen was instructed to go to Jinan when the National Army occupied Jinan to assist Commander Liu in handling important matters. Now that Jinan has been recovered, it is urgent to obey the order and go to Jinan. Therefore, he decided to travel west on the same train as the Provincial Government personnel. The Railway Bureau added a special car No. 106 and a third-class car No. 507 for Ge and his entourage to ride in. (August 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Jiaoji Railway Prepares for Full Line Opening <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Major Damage to Bridges, Telegraphs, and Telephones</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the Han and Jin armies fought along the Jiaoji Railway line, the entire line has been virtually converted into a military zone. Traffic was disrupted, and businesses, industries, and travelers suffered tremendous losses. The railway itself suffered property damage and operating losses, amounting to over two million yuan. Since the Central Army recovered Jinan, the entire Jiaoji Railway line has been under the control of the Central Army. In order to facilitate traffic, the Railway Bureau decided to step up work to restore full line operation in the near future. In addition to purchasing a large quantity of materials for emergency needs, today (18th) the heads of the Traffic, Engineering, and Locomotive departments were ordered to go to the line to supervise the staff, working day and night to speed up repairs. Unless there are unexpected obstacles, the full line can be opened within three days. The damage to the railway and the status of repairs are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Bridges: There is no major damage from Qingdao to Zuoshan. The most serious damage is from Zuoshan to Zibo River. In between, bridges over the Wei River, Dawei River, Yun River, Zibo River, Xiaodan River, Baiyang River, and nearby small rivers have been damaged and blown up in varying numbers of spans. On the 12th of this month, the railway sent the heads of the Engineering and Traffic departments to inspect and supervise the repairs. Currently, the bridges over the Wei River, Dawei River, Yun River, and Baiyang River have all been temporarily supported by sleepers, allowing for barely passable traffic. The Zibo River Bridge is also under urgent repair, and is expected to be completed in a day or two. 10,000 sleepers have been transported there, but they are still not enough. Wood is being temporarily purchased in the city and transported for use. West of Xindian, there is less damage. Generally, once the Zibo River Bridge is repaired, the full line can be opened.</p>
<p>Regarding Vehicles: Since the outbreak of military conflict, about 200 vehicles in the western section have been detained by the Jin army. The eastern section currently has about 80 locomotives (including those from other railways), about 200 passenger cars, and about 1,400 freight cars. Most of them are now used for military transport. Those that have been damaged are being repaired. It is said that when the Jin army retreated, the Japanese intervened due to the railway's debt relationship, and the vehicles were not taken across the border. Currently, regular passenger trains have resumed operation (passengers must cross the Zibo River Bridge to change trains), running once a day in both directions. Freight cars can reach Qingzhou.</p>
<p>Telegraph and Telephone: Telegraph poles and generators at stations west of Zuoshan have been mostly destroyed. Even telephones and batteries have been taken away by the military. Repairs are being rushed, and priority is being given to repairing train dispatch telephones and route markers to meet emergency needs. However, there is a shortage of workers and materials. The existing ones are being used as much as possible, and workers and a large amount of materials are being borrowed from the local telephone bureau to facilitate the work. East of Weixian, repairs have been completed, and the rest will also be completed within the shortest possible time in order to allow for traffic.</p>
<p>Fundamental Repairs: The temporary repairs to the bridges are all made using wooden sleepers, which are a temporary expedient. The Engineering Department of the Railway has prepared detailed plans for fundamental repairs, and some sections are intended to be rebuilt with alternative lines, while others are temporarily using alternative lines. Steel beams and other materials are needed for the fundamental repairs of other bridges. In addition to the existing materials, those that have been purchased but not yet delivered have been telegraphed to urge prompt delivery.</p>
<p>Reduced Wages: The railway has suffered heavy losses in this war. The large quantities of materials used require huge sums of money. The salaries of the employees in the western section also need to be paid. The debt interest of 300,000 yuan also cannot be delayed. In the past month, traffic has been cut off, and operating income has only reached one-tenth of what it used to be. To prioritize the use of emergency materials, the salaries of all employees will be paid on a reduced scale. For those with salaries above 100 yuan, 80% will be paid first this month in order to make funds available. (August 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Guangdong Northern Communist Bandits Recently Active <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Zhu and Peng's Forces Split and Flee from Southern Jiangxi and Southern Hunan to Guangdong</p>
<p>Renhua County Magistrate Requests Troops, Nanxiong and Lechang Telegrams are Disrupted</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the Communist rebellion in Changsha, Guangdong authorities have been thoroughly eliminating the remnants of the Communist bandits to maintain public order. Several months ago, the Communist Party organizations and criminal cases of Dongjiang Red Army Captains discovered in Sihou Street Datong Medical Society and Lao Jiaxiang in Guangzhou City, including multiple members of the Communist Party City Executive Committee, were detained in the Public Security Bureau. They were recently brought up for execution. All the detained Communists were executed in sequence. Those with lighter offenses were transferred to the Nantoutou Correctional Field Prison. In addition, the police have been executing inspections of firearms licenses every day to prevent bandits from infiltrating the urban areas. Therefore, public order in Guangzhou is still relatively stable. In the eastern part of Guangdong, Raoping County was previously captured by Communist bandits, but was retaken by a team from the 62nd Division stationed in the area at the beginning of this month. Currently, battalions and teams are tracking and suppressing the bandits. The Communist Party's General Office in Raoping has been raided, and several key figures have been arrested. According to a telegram from the commander of the 62nd Division, Raoping City was captured by bandits last month, and was recaptured by a special service battalion commander Huang Binglin. The commander reported in a telegram that the Communist bandits in Raoping, after being defeated by our battalion, quickly fled back to the Stone Well Bandit Nest and secretly plotted a riot. The commander led a team on a night raid on the (10th) day, killing over forty bandits on the spot, capturing seventy alive, including a head of the Communist Party, a propaganda officer, a Red Army platoon leader, a Red Guard Captain, and a secret communications officer (names omitted), who had been wanted by Raoping County. Also captured were a secretary of the false Raoping Soviet Government, a member of the Red Army children's corps, and a five-man squad leader, along with thirty-seven guns of various types, and Mi Yuchou, a clerk of the Raoping Branch Court, who had been kidnapped. A Raoping telegraph machine and many other reactionary publications were recovered. In the northern part of Guangdong, the bandit atmosphere has recently intensified. This is because the Communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have been suppressed, and Peng Dehuai's forces in Nanchang and Changsha have been unsuccessful, and have been gradually forced back by the Hunan and Jiangxi armies. Zhu and Peng's bandit armies have split and fled south. One force went to Ganzhou, fleeing to Xinfeng in southern Jiangxi, echoing the local bandits in Nanshi. Another force fled from Liuyang to Yongxing in southern Hunan, spreading to Guidong and Rucheng. Rucheng is adjacent to Renhua in northern Guangdong. The local Communist bandits in Renhua have also been stirring up trouble recently, threatening to attack the city. Therefore, the authorities dispatched guerrilla teams to deploy on the border yesterday. On the 13th, Renhua County Magistrate He sent a telegram of distress, saying that the Communist bandits in Hunan are fleeing south, causing panic in Yongxing County. The local Communist bandits in Xinfeng County, Jiangxi, have been unusually rampant in recent days, besieging the county seat. In order to protect the territory and secure the people, the magistrate has transferred all the police and soldiers in the county to develop the border and consolidate everything. The magistrate requested that troops be dispatched to the county to maintain stability. The authorities, after receiving the report, immediately ordered the 3rd Regiment of the Headquarters Training Corps, commanded by Wang Dinghua, to set off from the south on the 13th to the province. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Chen, the regiment supplemented its military equipment in the province and departed from Guangzhou on the Yuehan train to Shaoguan on the afternoon of the 14th to maintain stability. By the 16th, news from the local telegraph bureau was that telegrams in the northern parts of Guangdong Province in Renhua, Lechang, and Nanxiong were suddenly disrupted. It is thought that this was caused by the local Communist bandits sabotaging the telegraph poles. Based on this, the banditry in Northern Guangdong should not be underestimated. Therefore, the authorities are planning to dispatch heavy troops to suppress them thoroughly to eliminate the hidden danger. (August 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Leather Merchants in Guangdong Oppose Excessive Tax Collection <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Leather Tanning and Cattle Slaughtering Industries Unite in Shutdown</p>
<p>Leather Dealers from Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi Provinces also Suspend Shipments of Finished Leather to Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, excessive tax levies on cattle hides in Guangdong have led to strikes by leather manufacturers and cattle slaughterhouses. The root cause of this issue lies with the new company contracted to collect taxes on cattle hides, which has imposed exorbitant levies, provoking widespread opposition from the leather industry. Previously, Guangzhou only taxed raw hides, but the new tax collector has extended levies to finished leather. Moreover, hides entering the market from neighboring provinces are also subject to taxation. Leather merchants, burdened by these multiple layers of taxation, have repeatedly petitioned the Finance Department, requesting an improvement to the tax system to alleviate their burden. According to the leather merchants, in May of this year, a new tax collector, Mr. Chen, using the name of Guangheng Company, contracted with the Finance Department to collect taxes on slaughtered cattle hides and raw cattle hide exports. He altered the old tax regulations, leaving the tax on each slaughtered head of cattle unchanged. However, the tax on each hide was previously one dollar for a large hide and fifty cents for a small hide, but the new regulations make no distinction between sizes and uniformly levy 2.4 silver dollars per hide. The most unbearable aspect is that no distinction is made between sizes, and some small hides are worth only two or three dollars, or even just over one dollar, but the tax levied often exceeds the value. Furthermore, each slaughtered head of cattle is worth, on average, over one hundred dollars, with a tax of only two dollars, while each hide, regardless of size, is worth several dollars but is taxed 2.4 dollars. This is a reversal of priorities. Even worse, raw hides that have been taxed are taxed again after being processed into finished leather. The tax collector exploits the word "cattle hide" in the new regulations, disregarding whether the hide is raw or finished and levying taxes accordingly. Recently, inspectors have been dispatched, and if a peddler is found buying a half-dollar piece of finished leather, they are accused of evading taxes, the goods are confiscated, and the person is detained and fined, driving the leather industry to the brink of ruin. To survive, the leather industry feels compelled to argue their case. On the afternoon of the 15th, leather merchants gathered with their colleagues and held a joint meeting in a restaurant, with each business sending a representative. On that day, they decided to send representatives to various authorities to petition for redress. If the government continues to be misled by merchants seeking to harm others and disregards the plight of the merchants, they will have no choice but to strike collectively. The raw hide trade and the cattle slaughtering industry had already ceased operations and slaughtering on the 14th and 15th. On the 14th, the leather tanning industry in Bajiaoliao sent a letter to the cattle pen, halting purchases of raw hides and effectively ceasing tanning operations. Upon receiving the letter, the cattle pen operators, noting the complete halt of hide sales, also ceased slaughtering on the 15th, following the example of the leather tanners. Because beef is a staple food for city residents, the sudden absence of beef for sale on the 15th caused great inconvenience. Some vendors selling beef brought in from the suburbs charged over eighty cents per catty. Consequently, all beef-related food items in restaurants and teahouses were also discontinued. In addition, the leather brokerages in Foshan and Guangzhou had already gone on strike the day before, and the unrest is intensifying. Due to Guangdong's tax on finished leather from neighboring provinces, leather dealers from Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi have also collectively ceased shipping finished leather to Guangdong in recent days.

<h3 id="e64">The Turmoil of Increased Cigarette Taxes in Hebei Province <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>British and American Tobacco Factories Suspend Operations to Protest Taxes</p>
<p>Over Three Thousand Male and Female Workers Lose Jobs</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The original cigarette tax rate was 12% of the value, and even with the added special levy on smokers, it was no more than 15%. Two years ago, the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing implemented a unified cigarette tax, changing the rate to 32.5% of the value. At that time, a contract was signed with British, American, and Great American companies, stipulating that the tax rate could not be changed for two years. This agreement was set to expire on November 30th of this year. The Hebei Province Unified Cigarette Tax Bureau had been complying with this agreement. However, since the start of military operations this year, the tax revenue has not been reported to the central government but has been remitted to Taiyuan, amounting to approximately 500,000 to 700,000 dollars per month. In June, a Mr. Wang, the northern manager of a major Chinese tobacco company, petitioned the military authorities to increase the unified cigarette tax due to the stagnation in sales of over a thousand boxes of cigarettes, valued at around 300,000 dollars, stored in Tianjin. His intention was that an increase in taxes would hurt the sales of British and American cigarettes, allowing Chinese cigarettes to sell more freely. At that time, the northern military expenses were becoming exhausted, and the authorities naturally agreed to increase the tax. They dispatched Mr. Wang to negotiate with the British and American companies, but the companies stated that they would naturally support an increase in taxes to help the military and were willing to purchase two million dollars worth of unified tax stamps in advance to demonstrate their sincerity. Mr. Wang believed this to be true and reported this to the headquarters in Taiyuan. Yan Xishan immediately ordered an increase in the tax, changing the rate from 32.5% to 50% of the value. Initially, the Chinese tobacco merchants opposed this, but after repeated unsuccessful appeals, they reluctantly accepted the increase. The new tax rate was implemented on July 21st, and Great American had also accepted the increase. However, British American expressed their dissent, stating that the contract for 32.5% of the value would not expire until November 30th and that the tax could not be increased at this time. Despite repeated attempts by the Unified Tax Bureau to communicate, no progress was made. Although British American had not accepted the tax increase, retail cigarette shops were already increasing their prices by 30%. British American has a factory in Dawangzhuang, Tianjin, employing over three thousand male and female workers. Its products are sold in Hebei, Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Xinjiang provinces, with annual sales reaching over thirty million dollars. Since the implementation of the tax increase, the company has stopped shipping goods and has wired its Shanghai headquarters to stop shipments to Tianjin. The Tianjin factory has been continuing to operate, working only five days a week, because it has too much stored tobacco and is concerned about mold in the rainy season. On the 9th of this month, the Shanghai headquarters sent manager Hegede to Tianjin to investigate. Seeing that the warehouses were full of cigarette boxes and could not accommodate more, the company decided to suspend operations from the 11th onward, as further production would require renting additional warehouses. However, the factory needed to complete some tasks before suspending operations, so the cutting, steaming, sorting, and boxing departments were only shut down on the 13th. On the same day, half a month's wages were paid to the workers, and deposits for male workers were scheduled to be returned on the 18th, and for female workers on the 19th. Simultaneously, the Shanghai headquarters and the Tianjin municipal government were notified of the suspension. Mayor Cui immediately warned the Tianjin company's manager, Pille, and comprador, Zhang Xiaohang: (1) If the company suspends operations due to business stagnation, it should first submit a request to the local authorities. If it seeks a reduction in taxes, it should also first make a request. Only after permission is denied can the suspension be considered complete. During this period of military martial law, with the Communist Party poised to act, a sudden suspension of operations, disregarding the livelihoods of over three thousand male and female workers, could lead to unrest and affect social order, for which your company will be held responsible. The Public Security Bureau will have corresponding measures to deal with the situation as its duty dictates. (2) Most of British American's customers are Chinese. If the company suspends operations solely to protest the tax increase, the Chinese people may seize this opportunity to launch a boycott of British American cigarettes, causing even greater losses for your company. (3) Tobacco is a consumable good, and imposing heavy taxes on it is equivalent to discouraging consumption, indirectly burdening the smokers, while the company suffers no loss. Why protest? However, Pille's attitude was firm and he did not accept Mayor Cui's advice. Today (the 14th) in the morning, the cigarette-making and boxing departments were also shut down, and the entire factory was shut down by 10 a.m. The factory gates were locked, and the company staff continued to work as usual, but shipments have stopped. The various British American cigarettes sold on the market are from the inventories of the distributors, who have contracts with the company that prohibit them from selling other companies' tobacco. The four hundred or so British American cigarette distributors in the city have inventories that can only sustain business for twenty days at most. After that, they will have no cigarettes to sell and will have to close down. Gao Huai, the director of the Unified Cigarette Tax Bureau, stated that this tax increase, nominally 50% of the value, is actually only an increase of 17.5%. Other Chinese and foreign tobacco companies have complied with the tax regulations and paid the taxes. British American is the only one dissenting and protesting the tax by suspending operations, which is akin to extortion. The bureau is acting under orders and has no prejudice in the matter. Today, a telegram has been sent to Taiyuan to await instructions. Before receiving instructions from Taiyuan, goods from that company that have not paid the increased tax will continue to be impounded. According to a survey by the cigarette merchants' association, cigarette sales in the city have decreased by 568,000 dollars in the twenty days since the implementation of the tax increase on July 21st, compared to the average for June and July. The Unified Tax Bureau has lost 284,000 dollars in revenue. At 9 a.m. today, Zhu Ziqi, a publicly elected representative, took these charts and a petition to Zhao Pilian in Beiping, requesting assistance. However, Mr. Pille intends not to resume operations until the old tax rate is restored, even if it results in significant losses. At 4 p.m. today, he visited Mayor Cui to report that all operations have been suspended and that the factory staff have closed the books. If there is no solution, the staff will be dismissed. Mayor Cui replied that the municipal government has no authority to interfere with tax payment, but the suspension of operations affects the city's security and the workers' livelihoods, which cannot be ignored. Furthermore, the current tax increase, nominally 50%, is actually only an increase of 17.5%, directly affecting the company and indirectly affecting the smokers. The losses from the suspension are greater than the tax payment. Please reconsider, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Disputes over the Four Cotton and Linen Factories in Hubei Province <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Private Shares Unpaid After Joint Government-Private Operation</p>
<p>Manager of Fuyuan Company Arrested Hankou Dispatch: Near Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang, there are four cotton, linen, cloth, and silk factories established by the government, employing over six thousand three hundred workers. The establishment of the four factories can be traced back to the late Qing Dynasty, when Zhang Zhidong governed the Two Lakes region. Recognizing the encroachment of foreign goods and the hardships of the people, he established the four factories to promote industry, resist foreign goods, and maintain the livelihoods of the common people. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the factories were taken over by the Hubei provincial government. Later, due to losses, they were reorganized as private enterprises, with the provincial government only collecting rent and profit dividends, and renamed Fuyuan Company. In the past two years, Fuyuan Company has suffered further losses, with the machinery dilapidated and not repaired, resulting in lower production and greater losses. In February of this year, the company announced its closure, leaving all six thousand three hundred workers unemployed. In May, the Hubei provincial government, concerned that the large number of unemployed workers would affect society and that allowing such a large enterprise to remain closed would be a loss of resources, ordered Huang Meisheng, the general manager of Fuyuan Company, to resume operations as soon as possible. Huang, citing his inability to resume operations, petitioned the authorities for a joint government-private operation. The provincial government approved the request and set the capital at one million dollars, with the Hubei provincial government and Fuyuan Company each contributing half. A contract was signed, and Zhou Huangchu was appointed by the Finance Department as the manager of the four factories. The name was changed to Gongyi Company. The Finance Department issued two hundred thousand dollars in government shares to prepare for the resumption of operations and to pay off the five thousand three hundred fifty-four dollars in back wages owed by Fuyuan Company to the workers. The factories were scheduled to officially reopen on August 20th. The workers were overjoyed upon hearing the news, hoping for a swift return to work. Unexpectedly, the Fuyuan Company's commitment of five hundred thousand dollars in private shares has not yet been paid, and the outstanding rent of over four hundred thirty thousand dollars for the factories has not been settled, causing preparations to stall and delaying the reopening. The newly appointed manager, Zhou Huangchu, reported the reason for the failure to open the factories to He Yingqin, the head of the Wuhan headquarters. Yesterday, the headquarters sent a telegram ordering Huang Meisheng, the general manager of Fuyuan Company, to be placed under the custody of the Wuchang Public Security Bureau. After other related parties are apprehended, their dues will be pursued and they will be punished according to law. Therefore, these thousands of workers are now quietly waiting for the authorities to resolve their predicament. (August 20th)</p>

<p>Mengjin Flood and Banditry Relief Request Telegram To Xu Jun, Chairman of the Nanjing Relief Commission; Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin Charity Organizations: According to Zhang Shushen, the magistrate of Mengjin County, the county is the poorest in Henan Province, and the people are suffering from successive disasters. Currently, the military expenditures are enormous, and they are still trying to supply them in the hopes of an early resolution and temporary relief. However, on July 9th, the river north of the county broke its banks, flooding over a hundred square li in the northeast, turning it into a swamp. Towns such as Youfang Street, North Pass, East Pass, Xiaoji, and Shuanghuai Garden were all swept away by the flood, destroying fields, homes, people, and livestock. After requesting and obtaining permission to investigate and raise funds for relief, on the 14th, bandits suddenly emerged from the territory of Luoyang and Yanshi, besieging the county seat on the west, south, and north sides for three days and nights. Nearby villages were burned and looted. The city was in danger of falling, but fortunately, the Gan Army's Ma Brigade arrived, and the bandits fled south. On the 16th, Hengshui Town in the west of the city was attacked by bandits from Xin'an, who burned and killed indiscriminately. The town's militia chased them to Laodawo in Xin'an. On the evening of the 17th, two groups of bandits came to areas such as Zhencun and Wutou in Xin'an, besieging our militia, who are currently engaged in a fierce battle awaiting reinforcements. Since June 9th, the towns of Chen'ao, Matun, and Wangzhuang in the west of the county have suffered from banditry, resulting in nearly ten thousand deaths and injuries and thousands of kidnapped hostages. All the civilian property in the county has either been washed away or reduced to ashes. Corpses are scattered everywhere, and cries of grief fill the night.

<p>Reactions to Education Budget Cuts Former County Magistrate Sun Zuji, because of the severe financial difficulties in the region, has carried years of cumulative losses, and has been unable to remedy the situation, and has been forced to implement austerity policies. At the previous county administration meeting, he deliberated and decided to cut more than 40,000 yuan from the education budget for the nineteenth year. The County Education Bureau and the principals of the county's schools were of the opinion that the education funding in Wuxi was already extremely tight, and if it were cut further, it would be difficult to maintain. They repeatedly argued with the county government, but ultimately, without additional funds, there was no solution. The principals of the county's schools, with the start of the semester approaching, have not yet determined the education funding. Although they had repeatedly urged the director of the County Education Bureau to find a solution, they have not received a reply, which they take as a lack of sincerity. Yesterday, they held a general meeting at the County Education Association and resolved to: (1) send representatives to urge them again; (2) if there is still no satisfactory response after the urging, indicating that the bureau has no sincerity in maintaining the situation, in order to avoid future difficulties, issue a joint notice from the county's schools to unanimously postpone the start of the semester, awaiting a solution, and also petition higher authorities for instructions and inform the local elders to uphold justice. At the same time, the educational branch associations in various cities and villages held a meeting at the County Education Association and resolved that: ad valorem taxes should be used entirely for salary increases, bonuses, and subsidies for educational branch associations, and that old salary increases should at least be restored to the original plan, and a special committee should be organized to strongly argue with the county government and the Education Bureau. If the arguments are ineffective, all schools will go on strike simultaneously. The number of people on the special committee will be seven; (3) after the education funds are secured, the director of the Education Bureau should be responsible for guaranteeing that they are not used or reduced by anyone.</p>

<p>Village Chiefs of Three Subordinate Areas Kidnapped and Rescued: Shen Meijiang, the village chief of Sanyang Village in Houshengbu, Guoxi Xun, southwest of this city, had some assets and had long been coveted by bandits. In order to avoid banditry, Shen moved to the city in the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic. On the first day of this month, while traveling by boat to his hometown, only three miles from the port, he saw eight bandits speaking with a Henan accent and holding handguns on the shore, ordering the boat to stop. The bandits boarded the boat and kidnapped Shen Meijiang and his fellow passenger Pan Deshun. Later, Shen's family tried to rescue him, but failed due to various reasons. Unexpectedly, on the 16th, the security team stationed in Meixi sent someone to Huzhou to tell Shen's family that a hostage named Shen Meijiang had been captured by the villagers of Heping Liqi Village, and asked his family to go and claim him. Shen's younger brother, Meichun, went to the company headquarters of the Meixi security team upon hearing the news and confirmed that it was true. He immediately identified him, and the company sent ten soldiers to escort him home on a steamer on the 19th. Shen Meijiang has been in the bandits' den for nearly two weeks. Now, the details of what happened are described as follows: According to Shen, after he and Pan Deshun were kidnapped, they were moved five or six times, all in the Henan straw huts in the mountains of Heping. Each time, their eyes were tightly blindfolded with cloth, and they were carried by the bandits. Usually, three bandits guarded the hostages. On the morning of the 14th, because Pan Deshun's family had already paid the ransom, Pan was accompanied by a bandit to Heping Town to take a boat back to Huzhou. Shen himself was carried by two bandits to a straw hut near Liqi Village, about 14 li from Heping. One bandit went out on business, and the other guarded outside the hut. This was glimpsed by the villagers of the village, and more than 30 members of the village's self-defense corps, each carrying an earthen gun, shot and killed the guarding bandit. Shen immediately explained the situation of his kidnapping to the members of the corps, and they sent him to the Heping Town Defense Corps. The next day, he was transferred to the company headquarters of the Meixi security team. Now, the company has sent soldiers to escort him back to Huzhou.</p>

The police and defense corps suppressing them did not dare to arrest them. After robbing, the refugees moved north to Taodun, where they sneaked into the Gao residence and looted wildly. Huang Youliang, the village head of the place, begged their leader to exempt them from looting, but the leader said that it was difficult to stop, and named two leaders, Zhang Hanting and Chen Guoliang. At that time, the police and defense corps who were suppressing them nearby did not dare to find a way to stop them, and let them plunder to their heart's content before heading towards Jiashan.</p>

On the afternoon of the 17th, the company's Xieli, carrying passengers from An Station to Tai, when approaching the Xiabutu Wharf outside the West Gate, the driver, Lao Daou, was careless, and the bow of the boat collided violently with the bridge base of Xixin Bridge, causing a huge hole and sinking on the spot. Fortunately, the water was shallow and narrow, and the passengers were unharmed, but the hull has not been salvaged to this day, which is a hindrance to waterway traffic.</p>

After investigation, it has been found that it does not match the details published in the Zhenjiang News column of your newspaper on August 18.

<h3 id="e85">Problem of Adding Classrooms to Elementary Schools <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>One Million Classrooms Need to be Added Nationwide</p>
<p>An Average of More Than 500 Classrooms Need to be Added Per County</p>
<p>The outline of the plan to implement compulsory education has been approved by the Second National Education Conference. However, the addition of classrooms in elementary schools is a major problem. According to a senior official of the Ministry of Education, it is estimated that it will cost at least 200 yuan to renovate an old-fashioned house into a classroom, and about 300 yuan for various equipment needed in each classroom, for a total start-up cost of 500 yuan to open a class. One million classrooms need to be added nationwide. There are 1,915 counties in the country, and an average of more than 500 classrooms need to be added per county. Given the financial difficulties in various localities, it is only possible to use the ancestral temples of people across the country to open elementary schools, and to use academic palaces, academies, and public places. This has already been implemented in most places. In addition, it is also necessary to use all temples and monasteries, and to encourage private donations of houses or funds to build schools. The government should also plan and build a type of school building that is extremely economical and durable, and publicly set a simple and practical standard for equipment for various localities to adopt. Part of the subsidies allocated by the central government and the national treasury should be used as funds for building school buildings.</p>

<p>Completely Abolished in Schools Below High School</p>
<p>Jinling Women's University Will Be Closed for Not Being Registered</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has already issued a notice to all schools to comply with the cancellation of religious courses in church schools. Now, regulations have been stipulated that schools above high school may establish one elective course, which students may freely choose to join, but cannot be forced to. All schools below high school will be completely abolished and not allowed to exist. The schools had previously jointly petitioned for restoration, but this has been rejected.</p>
<p>According to a secretary of the Ministry, Jinling Women's University was ordered by the Ministry to go through the procedures for registration. To date, it has not been fulfilled, which is in violation of the law. After the summer vacation, if the school still does not comply with the regulations and register, the Ministry will have the power to close the school.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Reduction of Public Expenses for Liaoning Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Tuition Fees Changed to Be Issued According to National Currency</p>
<p>Significant Impact of Gold Expensive and Silver Cheap</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication: Before the 14th year of the Republic, the Provincial Education Department stipulated that the monthly tuition fee for each public-funded student studying in Japan was 15 Japanese yen. At that time, the currency value was similar to the national currency. In the 17th year, the students studying in Japan, due to the high cost and high cost of living, jointly requested the Ningxia Provincial Education Department to increase the fees, originally requesting that each person be increased to 60 yuan (Japanese yen) per month. The late Director Wang Yugui did not approve it because the tuition fees had increased several times, requiring huge funds and affecting the budget. Later, the students obtained the approval of Commander Zhang Xueliang to change each person to 60 Japanese yen per month and to change the tuition fee to an incentive bonus, which was very effective. At that time, the value of the Japanese yen had risen to about 1.2 yuan in national currency. Since the gold rush began this year, the Japanese yen has suddenly risen to about 2 yuan in national currency per day. The incentive bonus for each student is 60 Japanese yen. Calculated according to the 92 public-funded students studying in Japan in the province, the annual cost is 66,240 Japanese yen, equivalent to 132,480 yuan in national currency (calculated at 2 yuan in national currency per 1 Japanese yen). Compared with the 17th year, the budget must be exceeded by more than 50,000 yuan. The difference is huge, and the impact is quite large. The shortage of school funds has become difficult to cope with. If the Japanese yen continues to rise, the loss will be even greater. The Education Department considered the situation and planned to cancel the original fixed Japanese yen issuance and switch to issuing national currency. However, in order to take into account both the living expenses of studying abroad, the national currency issued was increased by 20 yuan from the original Japanese yen, to 80 yuan, and the annual amount per person was 960 yuan, so that the study abroad expenses would not cause panic due to depletion. After submitting it to the provincial government for review and approval, it can be implemented next semester. However, among the general students studying in Japan, except for a part of those who are wealthy, there will not be too much difficulty. For the rest, such as those who rely on tuition fees for admission and all expenses, I am afraid that there will be no shortage of dropouts.</p>

<p>President Lin Reports on the University's Recent Developments</p>
<p>Discussion of the 15th Anniversary Celebration</p>
<p>Fujian Concord University has been in operation for fifteen years and has a well-organized internal structure divided into four colleges: Arts, Sciences, Education, and Pre-Medical. It can be considered one of the best universities in the country. It now has hundreds of graduates, and a considerable number of them are in Shanghai. The Shanghai alumni of the university held a discussion about the university's 15th anniversary celebration and also hosted a banquet for the university's president, Professor Lin Jingrun, and Zeng Kexi. They gathered at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant on Sichuan Road last night at 7:00 PM. Alumni attended enthusiastically, including Huang Jiahuai, Xu Shaoshan, Wei Xiben, Chen Guanxiang, Huang Jiali, Lin Chengshui, and Li Zhi'an, among others, totaling more than thirty people. First, President Lin reported on the university's recent developments, which can be divided into several aspects: (1) Regarding buildings, a new Arts and Sciences building worth over 200,000 yuan has recently been completed. It has three floors. The first floor houses the offices of the president, academic dean, college deans, and department heads, as well as a large auditorium. The second floor houses the classrooms of each department. The third floor houses the library. The interior equipment and decorations are not only highly scientific but also artistically rich. In addition, there is a student dormitory that can accommodate one hundred students and a faculty residence building. (2) Regarding registration matters, the results of several contacts with the Ministry of Education have been very satisfactory. It is expected that the official announcement will be made by the end of this month. (3) Regarding university affairs, there were one hundred and fifty students last year, and more than ten new faculty and staff members were hired, all of whom are renowned scholars from home and abroad. It has also been decided to admit female students starting next semester, and it is expected that the number of students will break all previous records. (4) Regarding finances, the university received a large donation from an American philanthropist last year, so there are ample funds for recurring expenses. (5) The university has been established for fifteen years, and it has been decided to hold a grand commemorative meeting next semester. All alumni are invited to attend to rekindle old memories. After President Lin's report, the entire group discussed the Shanghai alumni's commemorative activities for the 15th anniversary and elected Huang Jiahuai, Xu Shaoshan, Wei Xiben, and Chen Guanxiang as preparation committee members to hold a general meeting on a selected date. It was also decided to tentatively designate Wei Xiben's office at the All Saints Church on Lafayette Road in the French Concession as the Shanghai Alumni Association office. All alumni of the university in Shanghai who have not yet joined are requested to report their detailed addresses to Mr. Wei for communication purposes. The meal ended at 10:30 PM, and everyone departed happily.</p>

The students worked diligently, sweating as they wrote. The chief supervisor was Yang Rushen, the Dean of the College of Business, who was in charge. Secretary Fan Shouchu focused on centralizing affairs and worked hard. Each proctor and staff member, including Pan Chuitong, patrolled back and forth meticulously. It ended this afternoon. The exam papers will be disclosed in the newspapers after they are graded.</p>

<p>Since Chen Shouzhi became the principal of Municipal Gaoqiao Elementary School in Gaoqiao District, Pudong, last autumn, the school's affairs have been developing day by day. The addition of equipment, the expansion of enrollment, the improvement of academic standards, and the training of character have all been actively planned and steadily promoted. In the past year, the results have been remarkable. The school's achievements in the national mathematics exhibition held by the Municipal Education Bureau this time were excellent, and it received a first-class certificate. New plans have been drawn up for school facilities in the next semester in order to develop them as much as possible. Recruitment matters have recently been handled, and new student registrations have been exceptionally enthusiastic. The school started on August 20th, and there are too many students, making it difficult to accommodate them. It is said that ways must still be found to add more classes.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Celebrity (bursting into the editor's office of a certain newspaper, fuming) — This is outrageous! I'm alive and well. How dare you say I'm dead in today's obituary column? This absolutely must be corrected!</p>
<p>Editor — I don't think a correction is necessary. Tomorrow, we can just put you in the "Births" column. Give you a fresh start in life. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p>
<p>A — I've done so many things in my life. Most of them went smoothly. Thinking back, the only thing that really disappointed me was something that happened when I was a child. I still haven't forgotten it.</p>
<p>B — What happened?</p>
<p>A — Once, I walked past a tent. Someone told me there was a circus inside, very exciting. I was thrilled and snuck in through the back. I really put my heart into it. But when I got up and looked around, there was no circus at all. Just an old man giving a sermon.</p>
<p>Old Man A — My child has been spoiled by his mother since he was little. We always indulged him. That's why he wants everything he sees now.</p>
<p>Old Man B — That's wonderful! Could you possibly bring him to my house for dinner one day? I'd like to introduce him to my eldest daughter.</p>
<p>Father — I think the kid's dimwitted. It definitely didn't come from my genes.</p>
<p>Mother — That's right. I think you're dimwitted, and it hasn't decreased at all. It shows that you didn't pass it on to him.</p>
<h3 id="e111">A Returnee from Fufeng Talks <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Fan</p>
<p>The frequent natural disasters in the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu have been astonishing. They've already been all over the newspapers. Although charities have been providing aid, the disaster areas are vast, and there are too many monks for too little gruel. It's hard to provide universal relief. My friend, Mr. Li, was commissioned by the Rescue Association to go there last winter to distribute aid. He spent half a year there. He's just returned. During our conversation the other day, I noted down the things he said that were most worth sharing.</p>
<p>Puyi Exchanges Fur for Virtue　Mr. Li and his party received a warm welcome from the locals as they passed through Hebei. At the time, the philanthropist Mr. Zhu Qinglan was advocating for disaster relief. He approached the deposed Emperor Puyi of the Qing Dynasty to ask for donations. Puyi, living in a small house in Tianjin, lacked the ability to turn lead into gold. He reluctantly offered five hundred light fur coats and many precious treasures to help with the relief efforts. However, the fox furs were splendid but not appropriate for the occasion. They were eventually sold through a lottery system. There was a frenzy of buying, and in the end, it was exchanged for 150,000 foreign Buddhas. The people of Tianjin and Beijing considered it a beautiful story. Everyone joked that even though the deposed emperor was poor, he still had three loads of copper. The saying fit well and he still deserved the title of a poor old boss. I read in the newspaper before that Puyi had a diamond and was looking to sell it. Now I believe it even more.</p>
<p>Yansheng Presents Sacrificial Vessels to Guests　The disasters were most severe in the counties of Fufeng and Wugong in Shaanxi Province. Mr. Li and his party carried money and food and divided into two teams upon arrival: one for burying the dead and one for distributing relief. They distributed aid to each household based on the number of people. They provided seeds to help with cultivation and stopped only after the autumn harvest of the following year. Hundreds of miles were filled with wailing, and the lives of those who were sustained for several months depended on them. The amount of money spent exceeded millions, but it was still not enough. It was truly a case of people relying on heaven for sustenance, but how long can people rely on that? The work of burying exposed corpses and digging mass graves was smelly and unbearable to witness. Compared to the prosperity of Shanghai, it was like being in another world. The group returned to Qufu and visited the mausoleum of Confucius. Yansheng Kong Decheng presented jade sacrificial vessels for inspection. The vessels gleamed like bronze and were truly unparalleled treasures, rarely seen in the world. It is said that even if military personnel visited, he wouldn't display everything. This shows his heart of treasure. Mr. Kong Decheng was only nine years old, but his attitude was solemn. He held a brush and wrote on the desk, reaching the small table. His calligraphy was elegant, his strokes strong, and his talent outstanding. He took a commemorative photo with the visitors before they left and also presented a couplet. Unfortunately, my memory is failing, and I can't recall the couplet.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Humble Opinions on Treating Dysentery <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>Dysentery is prevalent everywhere this summer. Cholera is extremely rare. (There are especially no cases found in Shanghai. This is likely due to the effectiveness of the promotion of vaccinations by the authorities.) The growth of bacteria is greatly related to the weather. Yesterday, I read "A Proven Prescription for Treating Dysentery" by the recluse Zhizhi in Free Talk. It uses peony soup, intending to promote bowel movements. The prescription is very good. However, the prescription uses two mace of rhubarb. Those who are physically weak and have had dysentery for a long time may not be able to withstand it. It would be better to reduce it to one mace. Western medicine treats dysentery. At the onset of the disease, one can fast for a day, not eating any food. On the afternoon of the second day, start taking a wine cup of castor oil, then half a grain of bismuth subnitrate, taking it once. Take it three times a day for two days. Diet should be very careful. Only use milk, thin porridge, and other easily digestible foods. Avoid raw, cold, and greasy foods. Also, injecting serum is very effective. Popularly, ash from hawthorn berries or a decoction of white cockscomb flowers can be taken with brown sugar for red dysentery or with yellow sugar for white dysentery. It is also very effective. As for preventative measures, one can get a dysentery vaccination or take "Vankexing Tablets" (orovaecin) internally. (Sold in major pharmacies and is also a preventative agent for cholera and typhoid fever.) Food should be clean. The abdomen should be kept warm at night. Have a bowel movement once a day. Bathe and massage frequently. Often rub the whole body with a dry cloth until it turns red. Or use the right hand to support the external genitals and massage the abdomen from top to bottom with the left hand. Then switch hands, using the left hand to support the external genitals and massage the abdomen from left to right, each massage done sixty times. This treats all abdominal diseases and is especially a great method for preventing dysentery. The bacteria of dysentery are often in the rectum. If it reaches the small intestine, it can be life-threatening. How can one not be careful?</p>
<h3 id="e113">Secrets in a Leather Bag <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Sheng</p>
<p>The autumn heat is like fire. One evening, my friend Mr. Chen Shangda came hurrying by, fanning himself with his right hand and carrying a leather bag in his left. He asked me to go to the Bund Park to cool off, saying that the horse-drawn carriage was waiting at the door and urging me to go immediately. Shangda is a bohemian and unconventional man. He is also curious by nature. Anything he hears or sees that is slightly strange, he writes down and puts in his leather bag. He never submits anything for publication. Taking advantage of his unpreparedness, I grabbed his leather bag first, joking, "Horse-drawn carriages are outdated now. Hurry and get a car so I can search for the secrets in this leather bag before we go." Shangda said, "One man's trash is another man's treasure. What's wrong with a horse-drawn carriage? There are indeed secrets in here. If you hadn't mentioned it, I would have told you anyway." He then took out a letter from the leather bag, addressed to Mr. Xie Mengren of Xin Chongqing Road, Shanghai, and signed by Huang Ji of Huzhou. It didn't specify the lane number. I exclaimed, "Did the post office misdeliver this?" He replied, "No, I found it on the road." The letter was very simple, just a few words: "My sister A'Hu, whom I dream of night after night, hasn't returned for a long time in this scorching heat. I know you're addicted to the taste of 'braised eel.'" There were a few words written on the back, in a delicate handwriting, apparently a reply from Huang to the original letter. It said, "Brother Ying, I haven't eaten any braised eel. Brother, you seem to have eaten 'vinegar-fried eel.' I'll be back soon. I won't betray you." This is secret number one. There was also a photo of a girl with her hair in a bun leaning on a concubine's couch, looking up at a handsome young man with clear eyes. Another photo showed a beautiful woman with a full face and a thick bun, holding a child and winking at the young man. I asked where they came from. Shangda said, "I write and paint and photograph. I painted them and photographed them myself." His words were very cunning and unbelievable. This is secret number two. There were many other things, but I didn't have time to examine them. He hurriedly dragged me out to the carriage. When we arrived at the park, there was a refreshing breeze and shimmering waves. Many couples were whispering or pretending to be angry or acting like Western couples, shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm. The sound of footsteps echoed as they walked back and forth. As we were about to leave, we saw a middle-aged woman walking hand in hand with a sad-looking young man. A little girl, just beginning to blossom, swayed her willow waist as she followed behind, calling to the young man, "Brother Ji!" She was chattering endlessly. Shangda said, "The world is a big leather bag. You don't examine the secrets in the big leather bag but instead search for secrets in my small leather bag. What a narrow view!" His words were also witty. So I recorded them.</p>
<h3 id="e114">A Kind Favor <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Bai</p>
<p>It is a very common thing for friends to give gifts and reciprocate favors. For example, if a friend likes alcohol and you give them a "Xian Bo" wine, or if a friend likes calligraphy and painting and you give them a piece by a famous artist, the recipient will be overjoyed. They will feel that it is inappropriate to refuse and shameless to accept. Otherwise, it would be boring. I am very fond of stringed instruments and records of famous singers. The other day, my close friend, the famous erhu enthusiast Mr. Zhou Zhenfang, brought me two of his most prized records as a gift. I privately guessed that they must be recent masterpieces he had acquired from a certain company. But I was wrong. They were two new records produced by the Kaiming Company: Yan Jupeng's "Nanyang Pass" and Hu Bilan's "Fenhe Bay". Although I have two or three dozen records, my ability to distinguish them is far inferior to Zhou's. Often, I see both flaws and merits, and I am unable to be completely satisfied. Now, after listening to these two records, the sound is loud and clear, and the quality of the records is strong. Even after being played hundreds of times, there are no white scratches. They are truly the best of the best among records. So I have written this outline to inform those who share my passion and to record this brief encounter. (No payment received)</p>

<p>— Compiled by Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Most of the soybean oil sold on the market is mixed with cottonseed oil. Even when the price of soybean oil and cottonseed oil are equal, it is still mixed. Cottonseed oil is extracted using lime powder, so it is extremely dry and irritating and harmful to the throat. However, there is a type of water-bleached clear oil in oil factories that is clear in quality and does not harm the throat at all, but the price is slightly higher (Yong Kang)</p>
<p>How to eat peanut oil: First, pour the raw oil into the pot. Cook the vegetables as usual, then pour a little raw oil around the edges of the pot. Serve immediately. When you eat it, it smells fragrant and is incredibly smooth. (Yong Kang)</p>
<p>During this summer season, when traveling under the hot sun, delicate faces and tender skin are often damaged by the heat. If you use Wudi brand Butterfly Cream, you can avoid this problem because it has the function of moisturizing the skin and increasing its beauty. (Zhang Mingrong)</p>
<p>If cooking oil is heated too much and catches fire, there is often a fire hazard. If you throw in a handful of salt, the fire in the pot will immediately go out without damaging the food. (Zhang Jinfan)</p>
<p>Every mealtime, flies gather, and their feet carry many germs that are left on the food. Epidemics of cholera are mostly caused by this. It is best to burn a plate of Wudi mosquito repellent incense five minutes before the meal, and all the flies will flee. (Zhao Qingpo)</p>
<p>If there is dust or grease on the surface of a dressing mirror or other small mirrors, do not wipe them with a wet cloth. Just wipe them with a little Wudi toothpaste and then wipe the powder off with a dry cloth. The mirror will be as bright as new. (Zhao Qingpo)</p>
<h3 id="e116">Brief Account of the Two Major Expositions in Belgium (Part 1) <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Six Zeng, currently residing in Paris</p>
<p>Belgium is a very small country. In the past, it sometimes belonged to Austria and sometimes to France. It was not until the successful revolution of 1830 that it became an independent nation. However, during the European War, it was occupied by German forces for four years. Later, with the victory of the Allied Powers, it regained its independence. This year marks the centenary of its founding. Having learned from the pain of past calamities, the Belgian people deeply appreciate the difficulty and value of independence. Therefore, the entire nation is celebrating. Special international expositions are being held in the two major cities of Liège and Antwerp, from May to November. While celebrating independence, the people can also observe the cultures of various countries and attract tourists from around the world, which will greatly benefit the country's industry and economy. This is the origin of these expositions.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the Liège Exposition. Liège is one of the major industrial cities in Belgium, located at the confluence of the Meuse and Ourthe rivers. Its transportation is well-developed, and its commerce is thriving. This exposition is divided into two parts, north and south. The northern part is larger, covering an area of 140,000 square meters, located along the Meuse River. France, Italy, Japan, Poland, Switzerland, and other countries have built magnificent and beautiful pavilions here. China, on the other hand, occupies a small booth in a general pavilion jointly built by various small countries and Belgian companies and firms.</p>
<p>Looking at the exhibits from various countries, except for a few backward countries such as China and Egypt, most are chemical industrial products and machine-made products. There are many displays of various machines. These are the powerful tools for modern civilized countries to become rich and strong. However, China and Egypt still maintain the original state of the 15th and 16th centuries. All products are mostly made by hand. While they are exquisite, how uneconomical are they in terms of time and labor? The current difference in national strength and the distinction between civilization and barbarism depend entirely on whether a nation's people can manufacture and use machines. Therefore, one can know the state of a country's prosperity or decline by observing the exhibits at the exposition.</p>
<p>The Liège Exposition focuses on science and its application, large-scale industry, agriculture, and social economy (Les Scicnces et Leurs Applications' Ia Grande Industrie' I'Agriculture et I'Economie sociale). China does not have many items to display, and this time, probably due to economic reasons, it has not fully displayed them. Therefore, the content in the Chinese pavilion, which resembles an antique shop, is very poor. Silk and satin are China's only domestic products. It seems that the best quality, most colorful, and most beautiful patterns could have been collected and displayed widely. However, for some unknown reason, there were only five or six bolts of Hangzhou silk, and they were not very beautiful. On the other hand, items such as Huizhou ink and Huzhou brushes, and Chinese thread-bound books, which Westerners do not understand, were displayed in abundance, which is quite strange.</p>
<p>Leaving the Chinese pavilion and entering the Japanese pavilion, one's gaze immediately changes. One cannot help but admire the Japanese people's ability to handle affairs and their skill in publicity. The scale is grand, of course, but even more so, the Japanese are familiar with the Western psychology. All products are aimed at practical application. The exhibits are rich in modern colors, and the method of display conforms to scientific principles. Therefore, Westerners linger, admire, and praise without end. Silk is originally a famous product of China, but the Japanese display ten times more than us and add oil paintings of peasant women picking mulberry leaves and making cocoons, so that Westerners know the origin of silk. The same is true for embroidery and other items. In short, in addition to expressing their national characteristics, the Japanese strive to find a common ground with European society, which is to meet the needs of modern people. The Japanese have never displayed anything like Huizhou ink or Huzhou brushes, which are of no use to Westerners. The purpose of the Japanese at the exposition is not to promote antiques-style national essence but to promote international commerce.</p>
<p>The southern venue is smaller, and the exhibits are more educational in nature, such as municipal administration and agricultural affairs. There are many models, diagrams, and specimens on display. There is also an art museum exhibiting ancient southeastern Belgian art (I、Art Wallon Ancien). The reporter silently thought that if the Chinese pavilion were moved to the ancient art museum, it would not be much inferior.</p>
<p>The above is a description of the Liège Exposition. Below is a brief account of the Antwerp Exposition.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Visiting the Palace of Versailles (3)</p>
<p>Yes. If China one day wants to paint this kind of historical painting, my suggestion is that while the deeds of Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Taizu of Ming should be noted, the ambition of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the genius of Emperor Yang of Sui, and the martial prowess of Genghis Khan are even more worthy of exaggeration. Originally, a strict history should take historical figures as the standard, so this French "Purple Light Pavilion" "Palace of Versailles" includes the images and deeds of wise rulers, tyrants, scholars, and poets. Let me continue our tour. Entering another hall, one immediately feels a stimulating burst of color. Hmm, it seems to be a painting by Rubens or Delacroix. Going forward to look carefully, it is indeed a large work by Delacroix. The European call Delacroix the lion of the Romantic school. He has many talents. With his strong colors and passionate expression, he single-handedly took the road that Romanticism was to take all the way to the top. Delacroix was probably the first to paint Arabs. This large mural also depicts the history of the French conquest of Morocco. The figures in the foreground have varied and strong colors. The expression of sorrowful feelings and harmonious rhythms is as moving as a drama. The oriental-style war paintings have probably reached the ultimate state of purification in this painting. Over there is another painting of the conquest of Morocco, about nine feet long. The King of Morocco, wearing yellow robes and holding a yellow umbrella, is in a state of utter disarray. Corpses are everywhere. The horror of the slaughter is depicted in great detail. We were quite moved by it. Such a massacre of a weak nation is by no means the glory of the Great French history. A picture of Napoleon's retreat from Russia. Snow covers the ground. Black and swirling clouds. The atmosphere is miserable. Napoleon rests his head on the hand of a soldier, as if this historical oddity has reached the end of his road. We also sighed in unison. A picture of Napoleon assisting Italy in the war against Austria and returning to the palace in triumph. A picture of the Franco-Dutch War in 1832. A picture of Napoleon III fighting Italy. But in the end, we feel that these paintings of spears and halberds and the horrors of the battlefield lack artistic depth. Countless war paintings were seen in various halls and cannot be recorded. This magnificent palace is a scenic spot visited by people from all over the world. Therefore, the French paint their great figures and deeds on the walls to show the glory of their history. Here, I suddenly thought of the Japanese's skill in imitation. Without anyone's effort, they vigorously imitate the Europeans in politics and academics. The forty or so murals in the so-called Meiji Shrine are like a small model of a part of the Palace of Versailles. Passing through several halls is a theater. The floor is made of marble. The decorations are elaborate. The surrounding boxes are made of five-colored marble pillars with extremely fine carvings. The proscenium is carved in stone and gilded. It is extremely beautiful. The backstage is incomparably large. Dozens of scenes are still hung on the upper part. It is said that in the time of Louis XIV, plays were performed here every day to entertain the nobles and princes. When we stepped into this theater, we immediately felt a sensual pleasure. This further made me feel that in the luxurious life of that pleasure-seeking monarch, there was the great power to promote the prosperity of art.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Financial and Gold Market in Confusion <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Strange Changes as if in a Fog</p>
<p>Rapid Advances and Sharp Declines, Like a Rabbit Leaping and a Falcon Swooping</p>
<p>Seemingly Tending Towards Softness　Yesterday's (21st) gold market conditions were extraordinarily bizarre, rising and falling suddenly. Fluctuations of two or three taels were common, almost too fast to react to, leaving people confused and unsure. The turbulent situation saw a total difference of ten taels, revolving within five hundred and forty taels, with a tendency towards weakness. The foreign exchange market was at times divided, ultimately being mediocre, not differing greatly from the day before yesterday. Trading within the market was consistently active. Large firms like Taikang, Runyi, Yu Yuan Sheng and others largely sold off, while Xinhang, Hengxing and others actively bought in. From the start of the pre-market, due to rising silver prices, it opened low and briefly broke the thirty-tael mark. Afterwards, as buyers eagerly pursued, it immediately rose, soaring ten taels, nearly jumping to the forty-tael mark. After that, it was a case of rabbit leaps and falcon swoops, with a five or six tael pullback, unstable and unpredictable, like falling into a fog. By the afternoon, Yiyu, Yuanmao, Yong and others had resumed buying, while Taikang, Runshunli and others sold off. The exchange rate shifted from decline to equilibrium, and the market atmosphere changed from weak to firm, with a six or seven tael reversal. Subsequently, it hovered around thirty-seven taels. However, spot goods were fiery red because the market inventory was weak, so the price was very high. Timed contracts required an increase of seventeen or eighteen taels, with the potential for further increases in the future. Although large bars of silver shrank by an eighth yesterday, the silver price rose by a quarter.</p>
<p>Extremely Variable Early Morning　The opening price for gold in October was 536 taels and 3 qian, up 1 tael and 2 qian. Gross prices fluctuated by one or two taels. Then Yuancheng sold, causing a drop of seven or eight taels, ultimately falling to 29 taels. When Xianling announced no movement, and Jinan, Xinhang and others bought in, it jumped to 35 or 36 taels, then to 37 taels, before dropping slightly again. However, the exchange market was still stable. In November, US dollars were sold by Maihang and Mitsui to Mitsubishi for 40 yuan and 025. Anda bought in seven pence and 9375 of October English gold, and Hengxing bought in, so it increased by 3 taels. Around 10 o'clock, it reached 39 taels. Afterwards, a speculator sold through a certain firm, in large quantities, and Taikangrun and others followed suit, selling off. In an instant, it plummeted eight taels, to 31 taels at 10:30. Afterwards, the exchange market strengthened. Sumitomo and Eastern mutual did seven pence and 875 for October sterling, and Datong and Hua Bi did 40 yuan and 01875 for next month's US dollars. Because Dalian Gang bought in, it soared, rallying by six or seven taels, with occasional ups and downs of two taels. At 11:00, it was 38 taels. Afterwards, it seemed to soften, but was hesitant, rising from 34 taels to 37 taels. At noon, it closed at 35 taels and 8 qian.</p>

The banks also mutually traded forty or fifty thousand pounds, and also traded two hundred thousand US dollars.

<p>Foreign Market Stabilizes…Long and Short Sides Compete Vigorously</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, and actual sales are more active, but large-scale transactions are still lacking. The overseas flower and yarn market is stable, and the Shanghai market is not as panicked as before. The period is in the autumn sales season, and the buying pressure is still strong. As for the selling side, the pressure is also heavy. The Chaozhou gang sells off when prices rise, and the amount is very large. Some manufacturers are also selling off. The long and short sides of the yarn market are competing fiercely.</p>
<p>Scattered Bids for Yarn Are Absorbed　Although Dafeng sold off each bid in the pre-market, scattered bids were continuously absorbed, with the hope that American cotton would turn up. Each month rose by two, three, or four qian. The market atmosphere was still good in the afternoon, with each month rising another five qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,950 bales. Dafeng sold 3,100 bales, Lichang 1,400 bales, Shenji 1,100 bales, Minghua 900 bales, Yiyu 1,000 bales, Heshen, Shenchang, Tongxing, Dachangcheng, Shenxin, 350 bales to 500 bales.

<p>The cotton market situation is slightly stable, but the trend is chaotic and inconsistent. People's hearts are sometimes good and sometimes bad. The market changes several times a day. This situation is difficult to grasp at the beginning of the new cotton season. After American cotton found a new low price, the market may have the possibility of temporarily stabilizing. Because domestic cotton is relatively high and spot sales are inactive, a part of it is still being sold off. Because the weather is not good, the bulls are still strong. What will happen to the cotton market in the future will depend on American cotton.</p>
<p>Han Bids Fall Near, Rise Far　The Han bids pre-market opened with a very good situation, with American cotton rising continuously, and the buying interest was strong. Each month rose by 3 qian. Then, Ruida sold off, and it fell another 1 qian. The closing price fell another 1 qian. As a result, each month still rose by 1 qian. In the afternoon, the current month suddenly fell to the 3-tael mark because the bulls were unable to receive goods. The Hengda manufacturer limited the price to 3 taels and bought 2,300 dan in two or three rounds. The far month was shaken, leading to a rise of 1 fen 5 to 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 76,100 dan. Gongtai bought 5,700 dan, Meiji 6,800 dan, Hengyi 3,100 dan, Hengda 2,300 dan, Daji, Taishengkang, Jihua, Huaxing, Jinfeng 1,200 dan to 1,700 dan.

<p>Slight Fluctuations in the General Market</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, not many ships arrived from various routes, and sales were extremely weak. Northern japonica rice was very quiet. The top-quality goods were still priced at 21 yuan, while ordinary and lower-quality goods had slightly reduced prices. However, customers wanted to bid higher for fresh goods, so japonica rice prices fluctuated slightly, but transactions were bleak. Although the Dongxin japonica rice factory wanted to push sales, buyers did not seem eager, and the trend was quiet. The general market was similar to the previous day, but there were slight differences of one or two jiao in the price fluctuations of high and lower-quality goods. New customers inquired about the source of premium rice, and the demand was still acceptable, so the market was soft. The upward trend of "Bian Yuan" (currency) was set, and buying interest was also flat, so the market was firm.</p>
<p>Hu'nan: Few shipments arrived from river routes. Street sales did not expand due to the scarcity of goods. Regular broken japonica rice was scarce and little traded. Although Sutong japonica rice slightly met market demand, the overall atmosphere was lackluster. Southern short-grain rice arrivals and sales were minimal, and prices were stable. Top-quality goods remained at 21 yuan. White Yuan rice was extremely scarce here, and there were slight inquiries about hanging sales, and the market was holding steady.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Foreign Rice Amidst the Lifting of the Ban on Hunan Rice <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice still did not see large-scale sales, and the market remained sluggish. Furthermore, the scheduled lifting of the ban on Hunan rice has become a reality, and it has been reported that the ban will be lifted on September 1st, with a quota of 5 million bags, and a fee of 5 yuan per bag will be charged. Although rice inventories in Shanghai are low, sales have been stagnant for a long time, and the market has been weak. If this large batch of Hunan rice comes to Shanghai, the market will definitely be greatly affected. However, there are still questions: can Hunan rice be shipped out in quantities of 5 million? Will this number be shipped to Shanghai in full? After adding passport fees and all miscellaneous taxes and transportation costs, will it be profitable to trade? Therefore, the rice market in Shanghai has not yet experienced major fluctuations, only suspicion and fear, and buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach. Saigon No. 1 rice has a relatively large inventory in Shanghai, and sales are slow. Yesterday, due to the news of the lifting of the ban on Hunan rice, the market price immediately fell by 3 jiao. Other types of rice fell by small fractions ranging from a few cents to one jiao. A total of 200 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were sold, priced at 16 yuan to 16 yuan and 3 jiao; 750 bags of Andong Geng, priced at 16 yuan and 5 jiao and 7 fen; 500 bags of Da Wen, priced at 12 yuan and 3 jiao and a half to 3 jiao; and 300 bags of Min Dang, priced at 14 yuan and 9 jiao to 3 jiao and 7 fen.</p>

<p>Tianjin Flood May Affect Inventories</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market for each month remained very quiet, so although the quoted price of foreign wheat recovered by 4 or 5 jiao, sentiment was still not very good. However, the market atmosphere this month has been stronger. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was still stable. Suddenly, news came that Tianjin was flooded and the autumn grain crop may be affected, so sentiment suddenly rose, and buying interest in both near and far-term contracts suddenly increased, and was better than the previous day by 1 fen. Looking at the future of the flour market, the biggest problem is that the factories must release chips before there can be a larger loosening. This month is already at a standstill, and no matter what, it will be difficult to fall below the 5 qian mark again. As a result, August and September each rose 1 fen, October, December and January rose 1 fen and 2.5 li, and November rose 1 fen and a half.</p>

<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday, the prices for each month fluctuated and then tended to be firm, because the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better, and this month, due to the large bullish positions, prices have been maintained. Because the value is too low, there are preparations to receive the goods, otherwise, there is still consideration of gradually settling. As a result, August, November, and December remained unchanged, September was up 1 fen, and December was up 2 fen. Because the factories unanimously maintained high prices for spot wheat, there was no trading in wheat arriving by ship or cart from various routes. The entire market only saw 150 bags of Xiashi ship wheat traded at a price of 4 taels, 7 qian, and 7 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Silk and Tea Market Downturn Continues <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the Assistance Association stopped handling Gongxi tea, the tea market has undergone major changes. British and French tea merchants are taking the opportunity to depress prices for various green teas from both road and local estates, and the acceptance of bids is becoming increasingly stringent. The ability of Chinese tea merchants to resist this situation has also weakened. Yesterday, the market price for Zhenmei tea fell by another 5 taels, and transactions were scarce, sentiment was weak, and the overall trend was declining. However, although the Russian merchants arrested in Hankou have not yet been released, the central government still allows the Russian firms to continue protecting tea production, which may offer some relief, and the Russian estates still have hope of reopening.</p>

<p>Raw and White Sugar Market Turns Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw dispatches from the producing region. The current price of Cuban sugar was 1.15625, a decrease of 0.03125 compared to the previous dispatch. The price of New York sugar futures for September was 1.12, December 1.21, March of next year 1.32, and May 1.40, each down 1 cent compared to the previous dispatch, except for December, which was down 2 cents. Spot and futures prices for Java sugar remained unchanged. Buying interest in raw and white sugar from the association was scarce, and sellers rushed to sell, with bids at 7 taels and 9 qian and a half, but no one inquired. As a result, there were no transactions in the entire city. Finely ground white sugar was at 8 taels and 2 fen and a half, and buying and selling were also sluggish. With the easing of factory bids for Japanese sugar, Meiji factory sugar suddenly opened with 20,000 bags for October and November delivery, priced at 4 yuan and 8 jiao in Japanese currency, which was 2 jiao cheaper than Dali sugar. And because the Eastern exchange rate has recently become cheaper, merchants have been eager to buy, and sales were quickly completed. However, the atmosphere in the spot market for drawn sugar has been slightly dampened, and transactions are scarce. TY mark was at 7 taels, 7 qian, and 7 fen and a half, N mark was at 7 taels and 8 qian and 7 fen and a half, and no other marks were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Dried Fruit Market: New Honey Dates Prices Have Eased <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since new Jiaxing honey dates appeared on the market, the supply has gradually increased, and prices have eased. The initial batch was once sold for 28 taels, but yesterday's transactions on the market streets saw sales at 25 taels, a decrease of 3 taels. Up and down gears still follow the usual practice of adding and subtracting. The market outlook is flat. Old stock, because most of the sugar juice has melted, is very weak even though it is cheap.</p>

<p>Public Market Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>Previously, due to the sharp drop in production prices and the lack of customer sales, the black pepper market plummeted, heading downstream every day. Trading houses opened at 75 taels and gradually fell to below 50 taels. Later, because the losses were too heavy, the trading houses mutually agreed to establish a public market to maintain the market and protect costs. Therefore, the market price was able to rebound to between 57 and 58 taels. However, customer sales remain stagnant, supply exceeds demand, inventories are increasing daily, and foreign firm goods are flooding the market, making it difficult to maintain the public market. The market then fell sharply. Yesterday, Nisshin Yoko opened for sale 150 bags of No. 1 pepper at a price of 43 taels and a half. Merchants' interest was extremely weak, and it is said that less than half of the goods were sold. The weakness of the market has reached an extreme point. Compared to the market price last week, the price has fallen by 14 or 15 taels, and the intensity of the decline is unprecedented.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Various Circles in This City Telegraph the National Government to Thoroughly Eliminate Reactionaries <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Destroy the Rebel Nests in the North...Clear Out the Communist Lairs in the South</p>
<p>Clarify the Universe...Relieve the People from Suffering</p>
<p>—Telegram from the Memorial Service for Liao Zhongkai’s Martyrdom—</p>
<p>At the fifth anniversary memorial service for Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom the other day, two major resolutions were passed by various circles in this city: (1) To send a special telegram to comfort the soldiers fighting against the rebellion in the front lines; (2) To telegraph the National Government to thoroughly eliminate all reactionary forces, comforting the soldiers fighting against the rebellion in the front lines. The telegram has already been seen in yesterday's newspaper. Now we will explore the telegram to the National Government as follows: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, forwarded to the National Government: Having repeatedly read the triumphant reports, we are delighted to learn that Tai'an and Jinan have been successively recovered. The main force of the rebellious Yan has been almost completely lost, and the remnant troops of the rebellious Feng are terrified upon hearing the news. Sweeping away the enemy's lair and destroying their base is just around the corner. All these achievements are due to the soldiers in the front lines who are determined to dedicate their lives. However, it also relies on the planning of Liao Zhongkai while Dr. Sun Yat-sen was in Japan, and the training of a party army with principles. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek was also able to lead the party army to successively eliminate reactionary forces. However, the martyr Mr. Liao had not fulfilled his long-cherished wish and suffered the harm of villains. The future of the party and the country suddenly lost a mentor, and the responsibility of our comrades became even heavier. On this fifth anniversary of Mr. Liao's martyrdom for the party and the country, imperialists are still creating rumors and causing trouble, warlord reactionaries are still jumping and causing trouble in Hebei, and communist traitors are lurking in various places, recklessly engaging in sabotage to prolong the lives of feudal warlords at the cost of flattering Soviet rubles. Our Central Government should remember Mr. Liao's revolutionary love, and at this critical moment, it is even more important to eliminate the root of the disaster, taking advantage of the pursuit of fleeing enemies and the accumulated power. When the reactionary elements are frightened, quickly send a large army to thoroughly eliminate all reactionary remnants, destroy the rebel nests in the north, sweep away the communist lairs in the south, clarify the universe, and relieve the people from suffering, so that we can report to the Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the spirits of the martyrs in heaven without guilt, and rebuild the process of political tutelage and construction. As the telegram rushes forward, we eagerly await the triumph.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Chairman Wang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Took Office Yesterday <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Delivering a Speech on Assuming Office</p>
<p>Since the election of Wang Xiaoce as the successor to the chairmanship of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce by the executive committee at a special meeting the other day, all executive and supervisory committee members immediately urged Chairman Wang to take office to emphasize the importance of chamber affairs. At that time, Wang expressed that he still needed to consider it. Yesterday at noon, all standing committee members went to the chamber and strongly urged Wang to take office again. Wang then immediately promised to take the position. He stamped the report on the re-election and took the chair at the standing committee meeting. At the same time, Mr. Xu Jiting also respected the resolution of the executive committee's special meeting and went to the chamber yesterday to take up the position of standing committee member. The report to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and your letter, as well as the speech delivered by Chairman Wang, are summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Report to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Party Headquarters: The subordinate chamber's chairman, Committee Member Xu Jiting, repeatedly requested to resign, and it was impossible to retain him. It has been resolved by the executive committee to elect another person to emphasize the importance of chamber affairs. Furthermore, on the 20th of this month, Wang Xiaoce was elected as chairman and committee member, and we report for your examination and approval, requesting your preservation and transfer for record. The case is that the subordinate chamber's chairman, Committee Member Xu Jiting, immediately declared his resignation after being legally elected by the executive committee on July 1st, and has not attended chamber affairs since then. Subsequently, the executive committee resolved to retain him at two special executive committee meetings on July 3rd and July 10th and went to persuade him in person. He only took office on the 17th, and on the same day, he submitted a report to your bureau requesting sick leave due to busy affairs and long-term insomnia. The duties were temporarily assumed by the four standing committee members Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, and Ye Huijun. On the 7th of this month, he again requested to resign and elect another person because his health had not yet recovered and he could not bear the heavy burden. Although the subordinate chamber's third executive committee meeting resolved to request him to maintain the resolutions of the two special executive committee meetings on July 3rd and July 10th, he still sent a letter firmly requesting resignation. Examining the situation, there was no way to reverse the trend. On the 20th of this month, a special executive committee meeting was convened to resolve the matter. On that day, ten executive committee members attended, and all agreed that the chairman's handling of chamber affairs was a very important responsibility. Since he had already firmly resigned and could not be retained, another person should be elected in accordance with the law to emphasize the importance of chamber affairs. It was resolved that the election would be held immediately among the current standing committee members in accordance with the law. As a result of the election, Wang Xiaolai was elected with nine votes. It was also resolved to send a letter to Xu Jiting requesting him to attend the position of standing committee member as soon as his illness improved to jointly participate in chamber affairs. All the reasons for the firm request for resignation by the subordinate chamber's chairman, Committee Member Xu Jiting, and the supplementary election of Wang Xiaoce in accordance with the law, are hereby prepared and reported, requesting your bureau's examination and approval, and requesting you to forward the report for record, which would be a public convenience.</p>
<p>To Standing Committee Member Xu Jiting: In response to your letter received on the 11th of this month, regarding the third executive committee's resolution to retain you, you still strongly requested to fulfill the agreement to re-elect. A special executive committee meeting was convened on the 20th of this month to discuss the matter. It was resolved that since you had firmly resigned, the only option was to elect another person in accordance with the law. Standing Committee Member Wang Xiaolai has been elected as chairman and committee member to take over. Furthermore, your letter of the 7th of this month originally stated that you would take the position of standing committee member as soon as your health improved. You should be requested to come to the chamber to take the position of standing committee member as soon as your health improves so that you can jointly participate in chamber affairs. Accordingly, the case is recorded and communicated to you, and I hope you will investigate and acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Speech by Chairman Wang Xiaolai: Chairman Wang said to the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency: Mr. Xu Jiting was recently elected as the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and everyone celebrated the acquisition of a talented person. However, Mr. Xu firmly resigned due to illness. The entire committee of the chamber jointly persuaded him to stay, but he did not agree. The executive committee then elected me to take his place. I have always had a desire to serve society, so when it comes to social affairs, I dare not refuse any assignment. However, I am still very cautious about public appointments and only take them after careful consideration. Even in recent years, when I have assisted in tax collection, it was because I had some knowledge of business conditions and hoped to alleviate the difficulties faced by merchants in Jiangsu as my duty. If I am capable, I will definitely fulfill my duty. If I see difficulties and shirk responsibility or pursue my own interests, then it would not be the foolish and honest nature that I dare to pretend to be. Now, as I take office as the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I must say that the position is complex and the responsibilities are heavy, and I am not capable of handling them. Moreover, Mr. Xu is highly respected, yet he modestly declined. How dare I not assess my own abilities and rashly take office? However, considering that the issue of the chairman of the chamber of commerce has been delayed for a long time and has not been resolved, I am fortunate that the standing committee members have taken responsibility for maintaining it, so that it has not been suspended. However, if the issue of the chairman is not resolved as soon as possible, then the organization of the chamber will not be completed, and how can we plan for progress? At this time, the chamber will be given an unnecessary ridicule and unfavorable speculation. Considering my sincere spirit of striving for revolution and my long-cherished desire to serve society, I cannot allow my personal situation to cause any obstacles. After careful consideration, I wanted to imitate Mr. Xu's high-mindedness, but it was impossible. I had no choice but to take on the difficult task and do my best. If I rely on the guidance and assistance of all the executive and supervisory committee members and the standing committee members, so that the chamber affairs can flourish day by day, if there comes a time when I cannot fulfill my responsibilities, then I will follow the precedent of Chairman Xu and report the situation and request the standing committee members to elect another wise and capable person to emphasize the importance of chamber affairs. At this point, Chairman Wang had other business to attend to, so the reporter bid farewell. The long-delayed issue of the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has come to an end.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting: The eighth standing committee meeting was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. The committee members present were Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Luo Qinghua, etc. (1) Conducted formalities as usual. (2) Read and approved the resolutions of the seventh standing committee meeting.

<p>Plans to Organize a Chinese Products Exhibition in India</p>

The chairman, Lu Wenshao, first reported on the situation, followed by representatives from various industries and committee members who expressed their opinions. They all agreed that the Indian boycott of British goods was an excellent opportunity to promote national goods and foreign trade, and that a concrete organization should be established to handle the matter. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Collect samples from various national goods factories, send personnel to India to hold an exhibition, and select personnel to conduct on-site investigations. (2) Publicly recommend Zhu Chunbo, Lu Wenshao, Shen Shuyu, and Lin Zimao to draft the organizational outline of the exhibition and name it the "Chinese Products Exhibition in India." (3) After drafting the exhibition outline, it must be submitted to the National Goods Promotion Committee for review and approval before formulating a plan and convening a discussion with various national goods factories regarding the implementation procedures. (4) Find out the current tax laws in India to use as a reference. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Municipal Party Headquarters Requests Central Government to Reorganize Shanghai Republic Daily <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>According to Guominshe, the Shanghai Republic Daily, is a Chinese Nationalist Party newspaper with a long history in Shanghai. Recently, the Municipal Party Headquarters requested the Central Party Headquarters to send personnel to reorganize the newspaper, citing its abnormal attitude, strange behavior, and disregard for Party Headquarters news, in order to rectify it. The original submission is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submission to the Central Government: Regarding the Shanghai Republic Daily's recent strange behavior, reversed news, and disregard for Party Headquarters news, which hinders the Party's propaganda, we request your review, dispatch of personnel for reorganization, and promotion of propaganda. The Republic Daily is the only Party newspaper in the city, and all news related to Party affairs in the city is published by the Republic Daily. Therefore, the Party Headquarters has high hopes for the newspaper, and the newspaper bears a heavy responsibility. However, the newspaper's recent behavior has been strange, the news has been reversed, the Party Headquarters' news has been disregarded, and the Party's propaganda has been hindered. The facts are listed as follows: (1) The Propaganda Department's fifteenth municipal propaganda meeting was based on the Central Party's order to discuss the expansion of the anti-communist movement. The resolutions were sent to various newspapers for publication. Xinwen Bao, Shishi Xinbao, and others, seeing the importance of the news, published it on the front page of the local news section. However, the Republic Daily, which is guided by the Headquarters, published it in the Party affairs column after the branch news and altered it without permission, adding arbitrary titles. This is a small matter of lacking basic editing knowledge, but a major matter of disregarding important Party affairs news and delaying the Party's propaganda. (2) The memorial of Mr. Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom was one of the important revolutionary memorial days for the Party. The Propaganda Department published the propaganda points in the local news section of various newspapers. Shen Xin and other major newspapers published it on the front page because Mr. Liao was an advanced member of the Party and the country and a revolutionary martyr, which was very eye-catching. However, the Republic Daily, which receives subsidies from the Party and is guided by the Headquarters, published it at the end of the Party affairs column, reversing the importance of things. Based on the above facts, the Headquarters believes that the Republic Daily's actions not only hinder propaganda but also cause misunderstandings to the outside world. Therefore, we submit this document, along with newspaper clippings, and request your review and prompt dispatch of personnel for reorganization to promote propaganda. This will benefit the Party. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee.</p>

<p>The Fifth District and Tenth Sub-district of the city telegraphed yesterday to the officers and soldiers who recovered Jinan (titles omitted): "Since the rebels Yan and Feng have started a war, poisoning North China, our central government has launched a large-scale campaign. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers at the front have followed orders, braving the heat and marching swiftly to kill the bandits. Recently, Jinan has been recovered. Your hard work and great achievements are admirable. However, as the elite of the rebel army is almost completely destroyed, they are fleeing in disarray. The complete suppression of the rebels is just around the corner. We still hope that you will continue to advance with the same spirit and eliminate the remaining enemies to achieve complete victory. We hereby send our condolences. Please acknowledge. The Fifth District and Tenth Sub-district of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party." Ma Yin.</p>

<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jiazhen arrived in Qingdao from Dalian on the Dalian Maru. Due to some matters, he stayed there. His aide, Mr. Li Muyuan, first escorted the luggage to Shanghai. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met Mr. Li at the Shanghai residence on Masnan Road yesterday. According to him, Wang is traveling south with his family. His wife and son stayed in Qingdao to rest due to seasickness and decided to take the Fengtian Maru to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive today or tomorrow. According to an investigation, the Fengtian Maru is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon.</p>

<p>After the vacancy of Zhao Tieqiao, the Ministry telegraphed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, instructing the heads of various departments to maintain the status quo for all daily affairs. After acting General Manager Cai came to Shanghai, he was also of an acting nature. The company's financial problems have not been resolved yet. Recently, after the government appointed Chen Xizeng as the successor, the heads of various departments have been looking forward to General Manager Chen's early assumption of office to solve various difficult problems. Now, it is heard that Chen has telegraphed to Beijing to resign. Yesterday, the heads of various departments of the company jointly telegraphed to Minister of Communications Wang Boqun, requesting him to urge the newly appointed General Manager Chen to come and take office as soon as possible. The telegram also stated that it was difficult for the various departments to remain in an acting capacity for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e164">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Determined the Scope of the Jinliyuan Case Arbitration <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Arbitrator Certificates Have Been Issued</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has hired lawyer Gao Shuo as an arbitrator for the Jinliyuan Wharf case. Yesterday, General Manager Cai, based on the results of the meeting of important personnel of the company (the 20th) the day before, personally presented the arbitrator certificate to lawyer Gao, along with the scope of the arbitrator's authority and the range of rent valuation and payment guarantee. However, as of last night, the Trinitarian Church has not yet given a formal response.</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the dispute between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jinliyuan Wharf and the French Catholic Trinitarian Church lease has changed from legal procedures to arbitration. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company issued a full power of attorney to lawyer Gao Shuo, stating the scope of rent increase and term limit, and requested him to handle the matter within that scope. Currently, Mr. Gao is waiting for notification from the Trinitarian Church. Once the church appoints an arbitrator, the two parties can formally meet and proceed. Yesterday, Mr. Gao also visited people in the church, such as Ma Xiangbo and Lu Bohong, asking them to help. It is said that when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Trinitarian Church first signed the contract in the early years of Guangxu, it was handled by Ma Xiangbo's younger brother, Ma Meishu (who was then the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company). Therefore, Ma Xiangbo is especially willing to mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Intense Competition in Sino-American Shipping <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>A Total of 112 Merchant Ships from Four Countries</p>
<p>Resulting in More Ships Than Cargo and Excess Tonnage</p>
<p>This year, the competition among shipping companies of various countries on the Sino-American route for the transportation of Chinese export goods is unprecedented. The shipping merchants of Britain, Japan, and the United States are especially engaged in head-to-head competition. The recent situation of intense competition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrival of New Ships Continued: After Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) added six fast ships in the Pacific, Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK) followed suit by building six strong, fast, and large ships. British company Jardine Matheson specially built the unprecedentedly large ship, the Empress of Japan. Two large ships built by American company American Mail Line will also be completed soon, with one expected to be finished first. NYK's fifth new ship, the Hie Maru, a sister ship of the Hikawa Maru, is scheduled to begin its maiden voyage tomorrow. The second new ship of the Daiban, the Tokai Maru, is also being rushed to completion. According to a telegram received yesterday, it will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th and begin its maiden voyage to the United States on the 26th. British company Butterfield &amp; Swire's New York liner has also switched to using the motor vessel Lyell City. The total number of ships newly added to the Sino-American route this year is 23, with an estimated total tonnage of 300,000 tons.</p>
<p>Intense Business Competition: After the new ships started service, they competed by boasting about their fast sailing speed. The competition for transporting Chinese export goods, especially silk and tea, was particularly fierce, resulting in no hope of price increases. For miscellaneous goods that are not abundant, prices were lowered to compete for cargo. For example, sesame seeds were reduced from four yuan per ton to two yuan and fifty cents. Other goods were reduced by 30%. This is the opposite of the increased freight rates on the European route after the gold standard was raised. Recently, shipping companies on the Sino-American route have been secretly lowering freight rates after the price cuts. Due to excessive competition, they are jealous of each other. All cargo freight rates and cargo manifests are prohibited from being leaked. If staff members reveal the true situation of freight rates and export goods, they will be fined 1,000 yuan. Inquiries from competitors are even more suspected. This action imitates that action. Today, the Sino-American freight industry has become a deeply secretive situation.</p>
<p>More Ships Than Cargo: The number of ships on the Sino-American route is increasing daily, while the number of goods is decreasing daily. (1) Due to the obstruction of transportation in the Chinese interior and the impact of the current situation, export trade is sluggish. (2) An unlimited number of ships are competing to transport a limited amount of cargo, naturally resulting in excess tonnage. In the past, only one ship sailed from Shanghai to New York every week. Now, it has increased to five ships. On the San Francisco-Seattle route, which used to have only two ships, it has now increased to four ships, resulting in the current situation of more ships than cargo. Even if prices are lowered, there is no cargo to transport. Therefore, almost all Sino-American liners have suffered losses this year. If this competition continues, the Sino-American shipping industry</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>will inevitably lead to mutual bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Current Shipping Lines: Currently, the ships sailing on the Sino-American route are from four countries: Britain, the United States, Japan, and Norway. Analyzing the count: (A) Japanese companies include NYK's 12 Pacific liners, 6 New York liners, OSK's 6 Pacific ships, 6 New York ships, and Kawasaki's 6 ships. (B) The United States includes American Mail Line's 6 New York ships, 9 Pacific ships, and Dollar Steamship Lines' 6 ships. (C) British companies include Jardine Matheson's 4 Pacific ships, Prince Line's 6 New York ships, China Navigation Company's 6 ships, and Blue Funnel Line and Butterfield &amp; Swire's 4 ships each. (D) Norwegian companies include Fearnley &amp; Eger's 3 ships and Barber Line's 6 ships. In addition, the British ships represented by Jardine Matheson include 28 ships sailing in the Pacific. The above are all regular liners, totaling 112 ships, with a total tonnage of over 1 million tons, which is quite alarming.</p>
<h3 id="e166">No Changes to the Sino-German Aviation Agreement <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Ratification Documents Can Be Sent Out Within Two or Three Days</p>
<p>The Sino-German aviation contract, officially signed in Beijing by Wang Boqun, Minister of Communications and Plenipotentiary Representative of China, and Schmidt, Plenipotentiary Representative of Germany, has been over five months. It is only awaiting formal ratification to take effect. Yesterday, according to a Beijing report, there were rumors of changes. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited German consultant Fuchsel and Chinese consultant lawyer Liu Shifang yesterday. According to lawyer Liu, the rumors of changes are absolutely incorrect. The ratification documents were originally scheduled to be issued on the 16th. Lawyer Liu himself was originally scheduled to go to Qingdao with German representative Schmidt on the 16th. On the morning of that day, when boarding the ship, lawyer Liu planned to hand over the ratification documents to Schmidt for signature and delivery to the Ministry. However, lawyer Liu suddenly fell ill, so he could not sign and send them out as scheduled. Now, the ratification documents have been sent to Qingdao by lawyer Liu three days ago to be signed by Schmidt and can be sent to the Ministry of Communications in Shanghai within two or three days. The rumors of changes are not true.</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Huludao Port Authority of Liaoning yesterday, stating that according to a letter from the Italian Postal Shipping Company, there were five questions regarding Huludao: (1) Is there a safe location to berth foreign import ships?

(4) Can the port allow foreign giant ships to enter at any time, or is it only possible during the daytime? (5) For building materials, such as cement, are there barges or other ships available to transport the goods from the barges to the shore? Please provide instructions for reply.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Northern Majia Section Telephone Line Accepted Yesterday <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The telephone project from North Bridge to Majia Bridge in Shanghai County was completed at the beginning of this month. The County Construction Bureau reported to the Jiangsu Construction Department, requesting personnel to accept it. The Department appointed Li Zhen, assistant engineer of the Jiangsu Electrical Industry Management Office, to come to Shanghai for acceptance. Committee Member Li arrived at the Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by Bureau Chief Wu Wenhua and technician Gong Maoxing, and took the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus to North Bridge. First, the telephone sound was tested, followed by Bureau Chief and others walking along the road to inspect the electrical pole line project until Majia Bridge. Committee Member Li believed that the telephone sound and the project were both perfect. It is a pity that the route is too short. All districts in Puxi must be laid out in a unified manner to facilitate local news and achieve significant results. After the inspection, they returned to Shanghai in the original car. Committee Member Li then said goodbye and returned to the province to report.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Social Bureau Orders Investigation into Truth of Rising Flour and Wheat Prices <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the flour and wheat market has shown signs of cornering again. It is said that a small number of people are manipulating it. After receiving the news, the Municipal Social Bureau believed that the period between the old and new harvests has not yet passed. Rising flour and wheat prices will inevitably endanger the people's food. The market prices are all in a backwardation situation. At this time when new wheat is on the market, this should not be the case. It is also heard that two brokers in the Grain Exchange have purchased and stored too much. The Bureau has ordered both the Flour Exchange and the Wheat Exchange to find ways to stabilize prices and set a deadline for investigation and reporting.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Grain Export News <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Shipped to Siam: Tomorrow, the British ship Kashmire will export 1,000 tons of rice reported by a Japanese merchant in this port to Rangoon. It is said that this cargo was originally shipped from Siam and is now being returned to that port.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Prohibited from Being Shipped to Tianjin: Since the ban on grain shipments to North China, white rice from this port is still being shipped to Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, and Qinhuangdao. However, the Tianjin area is lacking wheat flour. It is heard that commissioners have been sent to Shanghai to purchase it. The Jianghai Customs has absolutely prohibited the declaration of wheat flour to Tianjin. Therefore, North Ocean ships have no flour loaded on them these days.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Meeting Record of the Inland Flour Mill Association <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Inland Flour Mill Association of this port is the organization for the inland flour mill operators in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. It held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday. It is heard that the content of the proposal is to express disapproval of the new Jiangbei branch of the Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, which intends to inspect wheat and charge fees, causing disturbances. It also proposed that the inland factories' flour be added to the exchange's standards. It is heard that the regulations set by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining Inspection Institute this time are quite strict. A branch is set up in the Jiangbei area for inspection. A fee of one point per stone of wheat is charged. The Association argues that the Ministry of Agriculture's inspection of wheat is a good intention to improve agricultural products and has nothing to do with flour mills. It should only be applied to farmers and not to factories. Because the factory operators will never buy impurities, and the fee of one point is like extracting wheat tax. Moreover, if the wheat quality is found to be problematic in the middle of the transportation from the northern provinces, how will it be handled? Now, the inspection is not carried out simultaneously in all provinces, but only in Jiangbei, Jiangsu, which makes the Jiangsu factory operators suffer bullying. Therefore, it was decided to send a letter to the Institute to state this intention. As for joining the exchange standards, because the Shanghai Flour Exchange is the trading market for Chinese machine-made flour and has been established for many years, the flour factories in Shanghai and Wuxi have already joined the standards of the exchange and can trade freely. However, the inland factories have not yet joined, which makes it difficult to transport flour to Shanghai for sale. This time, it was decided to send a letter to the Institute requesting to join the standards.</p>

<p>The administrative group of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its first research meeting yesterday afternoon at the Lianhua General Association on Beijing Road to discuss the scope and methods of research. After discussion by the committee members, it was generally agreed that the name of this group is very broad. In addition to the affairs belonging to the factory affairs and personnel groups, all can be included in it. It is now tentatively defined as referring specifically to office management. Since the scope is broad and there is no prior preparation, it may be difficult to make a decision on the spot. It was then decided to send a letter to the committee members, asking each to draft a research outline based on their own views and submit it to Chen Canglai, deputy director of the group, at Jiuda Fine Salt before the 27th of this month. The director and deputy director will then consider, sort, and print it. A temporary meeting of the group will be held at the Lianhua General Association at 5:00 PM on September 1 to discuss it further.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Labor Unrest in the Nihua Cotton Mill <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Factory is Plotting to Start Work</p>
<p>The Labor Side is Preparing to Respond</p>
<p>According to Guominshe News Agency, the labor unrest in the Nihua Cotton Mill in Pudong has lasted for more than a month. The factory has announced the closure and opening of the factory twice. Recently, there has been news of using a large sum of money to persuade workers to resume work. The cunning of the Japanese businessmen can be seen in general here. The situation is explored as follows:</p>
<p>Using a Large Sum of Money to Bribe Lackeys: Since the factory strike has lasted for more than a month, the factory has not only not realized its mistakes, but has also been engaged in cruel destruction. According to reliable information from the union, the Japanese in the factory used 8,000 yuan to bribe six lackeys to discuss ways to start work in a certain place in Hongkou.</p>
<p>Hiring Thugs to Beat People: It is heard that the lackeys, after discussing the results this time, hired 100 thugs, giving each person ten yuan per worker, specializing in beating the leaders of the workers and the members of the Workers' Consolidation Committee, and at the same time rushing to the workers' residences to intimidate the workers to go to work unconditionally.</p>
<p>Workers' Consolidation Committee Meets to Deal with It: The Workers' Consolidation Committee of the factory, considering that the strike has been going on for a long time, in order to properly maintain the lives of the workers, decided at yesterday's meeting that, starting from today, in addition to inviting various unions in Pudong to discuss ways to deal with the situation, they will also send people to various unions in Puxi to contact the organization of a support association. In addition, there are many resolutions, but the content will not be announced for the time being. It is also heard that they are making great efforts to raise relief funds. Account books and donation registers are all prepared. Once the Municipal Party Headquarters approves, they can start working.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's Plan Did Not Succeed: After the factory strike, the Communist Party tried to seize control and manipulate it from the middle, spreading various rumors and conveying them to the party and government organs. Later, because the workers were unwilling to be fooled, and at the same time the party and government organs came out to advocate justice, the workers all abided by the guidance and waited quietly for mediation. The Communist Party, seeing that one plan did not succeed, retreated and colluded with the lackeys, hoping to cause trouble and destruction, inducing the workers to go to work unconditionally. On the one hand, they spread rumors again, blaming the party and government organs. How poisonous is the Communist Party. It is a pity that people have already seen through their treachery, and the party and government organs have also made great efforts for this matter. Although the Communist Party is cunning, their plan will definitely not succeed.</p>

<p>New Workers Have Not Fully Resigned</p>
<p>Union Makes Verbal Statement to Mediator</p>
<p>The French Tram and Waterworks strike, having resumed work at 1:00 PM on the 13th of this month, immediately began issuing back pay for the strike period that same day. Representatives such as Zhang Amao and others, successively received 63,000 yuan from Mr. Du Yuesheng, and the payment was completed yesterday. The amounts of wages for each department are listed separately below: Road Department: 613 yuan, 6 jiao, 4 fen; Driving Department: 3,414 yuan, 4 jiao, plus 34 yuan, 4 jiao, 6 fen; Ticketing Department: 5,166 yuan, 7 jiao, 3 fen; Machine Shop: 9,080 yuan, 6 jiao, 7 fen; Route Béttancourt Waterworks: 278 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen; Lujiabang Waterworks Short-Term Workers: 1,256 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen; Day Shift: 1,913 yuan, 6 jiao, 3 fen; Main Lines Department: 2,427 yuan, 6 jiao, 3 fen; Internal and External Staff: 10,339 yuan, 4 jiao, 8 fen; Night Shift: 1,973 yuan, 3 jiao, 4 fen; Substation: 301 yuan, 5 jiao, 3 fen; Engine Room: 3,059 yuan, 1 jiao, 9 fen; New Car Shop Day Shift: 730 yuan, 3 jiao, 2 fen; Cement Department Short-Term Workers: 1,043 yuan, 1 jiao; New Engineering Office: 3,764 yuan, 2 jiao, 8 fen; Night Shift: 1,012 yuan, 8 jiao, 9 fen; Main Lines Department Short-Term Workers: 2,795 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen; Lujiabang Waterworks: 3,539 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen; Dongjiadu Waterworks: 3,305 yuan, 4 jiao, 3 fen; Tram Department Lighting: 209 yuan, 3 jiao, 6 fen; Main Lines Office: 450 yuan, 8 jiao, 7 fen; Connection Department: 1,938 yuan, 3 jiao, 8 fen; Meter Department: 1,319 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen; Road Administration Office: 3,544 yuan, 6 jiao, 2 fen; Total payment: 63,413 yuan, 2 jiao, 1 fen. Furthermore, whether or not those who did not join the union during the strike period receive wages is not the union's concern.</p>
<p>It is heard that when work resumed that day, Mr. Du Yuesheng verbally guaranteed that the new workers would all leave their positions within three days. Although a majority of the new workers have received their wages and voluntarily resigned, there are still a few who, relying on foreign influence, continue to work. Despite repeated warnings from the union, advising them to resign as soon as possible to avoid further disputes, union members have frequently reported such situations to the union and urge for a solution to be devised. The union has made a verbal request to Mr. Du. In addition, the 24 people previously released from the police station have successively entered the factory in the past two days, preparing to resume work. However, the management has surprisingly refused them. The union has sent people to strenuously negotiate with the mediator, striving to ensure that all of them can return to work.</p>

<p>Citizens' Association Discusses Response Measures</p>
<p>The Citizens' United Association, due to the refusal of foreign insurance companies to compensate for cargo losses to Fuzhou businesses, which has caused significant harm, previously resolved in a meeting to petition the Municipal Party Department to forward a request to the Central Government to find ways to provide relief and prohibition. It also issued a notice to Chinese merchants, urging them to switch to Chinese insurance companies for all insurance needs. Yesterday, the association received instruction number 217 from the Municipal Party Department, stating, "Regarding the submitted request concerning foreign insurance companies failing to compensate for accidents, please forward it to the Central Government and consult the National Government to strictly prohibit such practices. Your submission has been received and approved for forwarding. Please be informed accordingly." The association has now scheduled a general meeting for today (the 22nd) to further discuss this case and organize a special committee to handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Negotiations on Cases of Cross-Border Investigation by the Municipal Council <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau requesting negotiations regarding cases of cross-border investigation by the Municipal Council. The original petition stated, "On the 6th of this month, we received a letter from the Rickshaw Guild stating that on the 2nd of this month, at 8:00 AM, individuals claiming to be detectives Wang Chengying and Feng Zhiming from the Fourth Avenue Police Station of the Public Concession Municipal Council came to the Nanshi Guild Hall (i.e., the Jianghuai Native Place Association outside the Great South Gate) to inquire about the identities of Wang Rongqing, Zhang Huaiyang, and Zhang Shizhou. Our association secretary, Zhang Shizhou, led them to a secluded room for a detailed discussion. The detectives stated that someone had recently accused them to the Fourth Avenue Police Station of being disorderly elements. The police station, for the sake of prudence, had come to conduct an on-site investigation. They suggested that the reason for the accusation and its contents be inquired directly from Detective Chief Lu Liankui at the police station. Subsequently, after committee members Da Jin and Ding Lianyuan informed them about the reorganization process and internal situation, the detectives copied down the detailed addresses of Wang Rongqing and others and left. Upon hearing this, our association was deeply alarmed, considering it to be a fabricated accusation. Even if the law were effective, it would still be subject to suppression. Since the police station belongs to the concession, it has no right to accept accusations or send personnel for investigation. We request you to swiftly negotiate with the Public Concession based on reason to protect human rights and warn against future occurrences." The letter arrived at the association after the Rickshaw Guild had been requested to provide the addresses of the three persons and confirm whether they lived in the concession or the Chinese territory, since their address was located in Chinese territory. Now, we have received a reply stating that Wang Rongqing resides at No. 126, Santai Wharf, Lianghui Street, Nanshi; Zhang Huaiyang resides at No. 28, Darenli, east end of Xie Bridge; and Zhang Shizhou resides at No. 4, Lirenli, Limalu, South Pier. Considering the above circumstances, all the accused individuals in this case have their offices and private residences outside the concession. The Municipal Council's police station should not have accepted the case across borders or dispatched detectives for investigation. This matter concerns the infringement of the Chinese government's administrative authority. We reasonably submit this situation to your bureau for review to determine whether or not to forward it to the municipal government for strict negotiations. Awaiting your decision."</p>

<h3 id="e183">Three Notices from the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Transportation Departments <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Implement Safety Measures for Train Accidents</p>
<p>Restrictions on Transporting Goods by Train</p>
<p>Train Arrivals and Departures Require Telegraph Notifications</p>
<p>The Transportation Department of the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways yesterday issued three notices to station staff: (1) Recent investigations have revealed that accidental events are often not reported, or the safety measures stipulated in the "Regulations for Train Accident Rescue" are not followed, or the personnel are completely unaware of the relevant regulations, which is highly inappropriate. In the future, any incidents must be reported immediately, and the regulations outlined in the "Regulations for Train Accident Rescue" must be strictly followed. Any deliberate violations will be punished. (2) Only railway cars that are in good condition and sturdy are permitted to transport goods on the Jinghu Line. When transporting lumber, only steel cars from the Jinghu Line must be used. Due to incomplete mechanical equipment, the 10-ton freight cars of this line, whether boxcars or livestock cars, are not allowed to transport goods to the Jinghu Line. Please pay attention. (3) The head of the Hangzhou Transportation Section reported that it has been found that when trains arrive or depart from a station, the stationmaster sends a telegram to the preceding or following station for the sake of train safety, which is of utmost importance. However, stations are treating this as a mere formality and not following the regulations, either using a telephone for notification or inquiring by telephone afterwards to fill in the information. This disregards the importance of safe train operation. Despite repeated warnings, this habit is difficult to change. It is requested that each station be ordered to cut out, sign, and submit the telegram strips of train arrival and departure times daily to the relevant section chief for verification. A telegraph operator should be specially assigned by the section chief to review the telegram strips to see if they comply with the regulations. If this is done, there will be no excuse. Please advise whether this is feasible. Based on this report, it has been found that stationmasters are not following the regulations for notifying the preceding and following stations by telegram when trains arrive or depart, which is not in accordance with train safety. Therefore, we hereby send a circular to inform and admonish each stationmaster to cut out and sign the telegram strips of train arrival and departure times, starting from today, and submit them to the respective section chiefs for verification.</p>

<p>Issues Regarding Resident Monk Replacements The Chinese Buddhist Association recently received a document from the Guizhou Provincial Buddhist Association stating that while Article 11 of the Regulations for Supervising Temples contains detailed procedures for removing resident monks, there are no explicit regulations regarding the selection and replacement of resident monks after removal. The Guizhou Provincial Government has approved a directive to all counties, stating that if a resident monk is removed for violating the regulations, the Buddhist Association should be notified immediately to convene a meeting to publicly discuss and select a replacement to ensure uniformity. The association has notified all provincial Buddhist associations to take note.</p>
<p>The National Government's Earnest Concern for Protecting Buddhism Lately, with the overall situation unsettled, local thugs have taken the opportunity to seize temple properties and expel monks and nuns. The Chinese Buddhist Association has repeatedly received urgent letters and telegrams from Buddhist organizations in Sichuan and Henan provinces, and has separately petitioned the National Government and the Ministry of Interior of the Executive Yuan to protect them according to the law. It has now been heard that the association has successively received replies, granting permission to telegraph Commander-in-Chief He and the local governments to handle the matter in accordance with the Regulations for Supervising Temples.</p>
<h3 id="e185">A New Look for Rue de Consulat in the French Concession <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Rue de Consulat (i.e., Avenue du Consul General) in the French Concession of this port is the most prosperous road in the new and old concessions. Therefore, the French Municipal Council plans and carries out improvements meticulously for all road construction on this road, striving for perfection. Since deciding to rebuild all the shops and buildings on both sides of the road in the style of Queen's Road in Hong Kong, it has been gradually implementing the reconstruction in recent years. Nearly half of the road has already been successfully rebuilt. It has been found that the exterior of the buildings is quite magnificent, and the interior construction is very spacious. The sidewalks on both sides can avoid ground moisture when it rains, and there is no exposure to sunlight when it is sunny, which is very convenient for pedestrians, and does not cause any losses to the shops. Therefore, the merchants and residents of the road all praise it. Currently, from the Eight Immortals Bridge westward, Deshun Lane (already rebuilt) on the north side, Yuqing Lane (under construction), Shengping Lane (already rebuilt), and from East Laihuo Street to Dongxin Bridge Street (completed), a section from Zhengjia Muqiao Street eastward near Mofang Street (under construction), a section from the Eight Immortals Bridge to West Xinqiao Street (rebuilt, only three or four have not yet been rebuilt) on the south side, and a section from West Xinqiao Street to West Laihuo Street (already rebuilt), Xigaodi Lane and Gaodi Lane (rebuilt, Deshan Lane to its east will probably be rebuilt soon), Bulin Lane (under construction), and opposite the Grand Belfry further east (also about to be constructed), and a section of Tianzhutang Street (already rebuilt). Therefore, the entire road from the Eight Immortals Bridge to Dongxin Bridge Street, both north and south, has been completed uniformly, and the atmosphere has been renewed. It is expected that the entire road can be rebuilt uniformly in a few more years.</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Special District Court Heard the Wu Suzhong Case Yesterday <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Judge Advocates for Investigation of True Name</p>
<p>Result Pending Submission of Evidence for Further Verification</p>
<p>Shishi Xinbao reporter Wu Suzhong, accused of being the Communist Hu Yu, was detained by detectives on August 1 and brought to the Special District Court, ordered to be held in custody pending investigation. Yesterday morning, the trial date arrived again. The police brought Hu to the Special District Court. Presiding Judge Xu Jiawei stated that this case should be handled by the High Court, according to a previous ruling, he was bound and could not hear the case, so he transferred it to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Ye Zaizhou, upon taking the stand in the First Tribunal, announced the reason for the High Court's lack of jurisdiction over the case, stating that it was a Communist case transferred from the interior, not a public case filed by the police. Therefore, the defendant was returned to the District Court, where Judge Xu began the trial in the First Tribunal. Prosecutor Xu Geng also attended to perform his duties, while the Songhu Garrison Headquarters specially sent legal counsel James Kee-Ong to the court. First, Detective Wang Bin from the Garrison Headquarters' Investigation Team stated the reason for transferring the defendant, saying that it was based on a secret agent named Xu, who, on May 29, while transferring another Communist case to the High Court Branch, saw the report in court. Xu immediately told him that this person was also an important member of the Communist Party. He then planned to arrest him, but police lawyer Ru Bao-yi told him that if the interior authorities wanted to arrest a suspect in the concession, they had to obtain an arrest warrant from the court, unless it was a case of flagrant offense. Therefore, he abandoned the plan. Later, he obtained an arrest warrant from the court and apprehended him on Nanjing Road on August 1. However, Xu has not returned to the team since leaving on August 3. Besides, although there are people who can testify that the defendant is indeed the Communist Hu Yu, they are unwilling to appear in court to testify. Next, lawyer Ru recounted the events of June 1, when Detective Wang wanted to arrest the defendant at the High Court Branch but was told that he could not arrest him without an arrest warrant. Then, detective Zhang Yi from the Old Gate Police Station reported the situation after arresting the defendant and being instructed to search the defendant's residence at No. 732, Qipu Road, saying that all the letters and other items found were in the name of Wu Suzhong, and submitted the documents and newspapers found. Then the debate began. First, the police lawyer, Mr. Bolland, translated, "According to Article 1, Section 2 of the National Revolutionary Army's Army Trial Regulations promulgated by the National Government on February 17, the Ordinary Court should try non-military personnel who have committed crimes. The defendant is a journalist, not an active-duty soldier. Even if he has violated military law, he is not subject to trial by military organs. According to the plaintiff, the defendant is a Communist, then he has committed crimes under Article 103 of the Criminal Law and the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law, all of which belong to ordinary law. Now, the requester for transfer is the Headquarters, but it does not belong to a military offender. The military organ has absolutely no right to hear the case. The ones who can transfer it are only the Shanghai District Court or the Jiangsu High Court. If it is transferred to a military organ, it should be forwarded by the Public Security Bureau, but there must be proof of the crime first. Article 6 of the signed agreement to recover the court specifies that a criminal found in the Public Concession, after investigation by the court of the various countries, can be transferred to the non-concession offices, but by the entrustment of other Chinese modern courts, if the court has confirmed the identity, it can be transferred immediately. Now, the plaintiff has not submitted conclusive evidence. Although Detective Wang has made many statements, as a rule, whenever the police report a case, in addition to the testimony of the detectives and the statements of the Municipal Council's lawyers, other evidence must be collected to form a conviction, not just relying on the words of the police. This case should also be treated as such to show fairness. In short, whether the defendant's arrest is fair or not is not being discussed here. Now, after two trials, a journalist has been held in custody for such a long time. The lawyer has already stated all the laws that can be cited. The Presiding Judge should pay attention." James Kee-Ong, the legal counsel of the Headquarters, continued to argue, saying that the Municipal Council's lawyer's statement was nothing more than two points: (1) The case should not be under the jurisdiction of the Headquarters; (2) The accusation against the defendant. However, the Army, Navy, and Air Force Trial Regulations he cited did not pay attention to the martial law area at all. The defendant committed the crime in the martial law zone of Jiangsu Province, and the arrest occurred during the period of martial law, so it is of course under the jurisdiction of the Headquarters. Moreover, the National Government recently had a secret order on August 1 that all important Communist cases should be handled by military organs, and even those already accepted by ordinary courts should be transferred to military organs. Although the defendant is not a soldier, the Headquarters absolutely has the right to hear the case. As for the name of the crime, since he is a Communist, he must be interrogated according to the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law before a judgment can be made. What should be studied today is the procedure for transfer. Whether or not the crime has been committed will be investigated by the Headquarters. If the interrogation shows that he is innocent, he will not be punished. To conclude that he had not committed a crime before, simply because no anti-revolutionary evidence was found in his residence, is not a solid argument. It is difficult to guarantee that the evidence was not destroyed after the defendant's arrest. It is appropriate to approve the transfer of the case to the Headquarters for trial. The police lawyer further argued against the points of martial law and secret orders, saying that the concession does not belong to the martial law area, and the secret order is not a promulgated law. According to Article 2 of the agreement, any laws and regulations that must be promulgated are effective in this court. The agreement was signed with various countries and is no different from the Constitution of this court, which cannot be changed arbitrarily. Lawyer James immediately retorted, saying that the concession does not belong to the martial law area is a matter of fact, but a notice stating that Shanghai is not in Jiangsu should not be requested. Pudong is in the martial law area of Jiangsu, which should be noted. Lawyer Song slightly argued for the defendant. The defendant requested the court to allow him to confess. The main points were approximately: (1) He resolutely denied the name Hu Yu, saying that investigations could be carried out in all directions; (2) The current event was a blackmail attempt by a Xu surnamed person who was unsuccessful in extorting 50 yuan and fabricated accusations; (3) He cited the cases of lawyer Shen Xingxia and others who were previously falsely accused of being reactionaries as examples and requested to refute the transfer; (4) He applied for bail. Finally, Prosecutor Xu expressed his opinion that the defendant's name had not yet been determined and should be investigated further. Judge Xu then ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and instructed the Headquarters to submit evidence, and rescheduled the trial.</p>

<p>Defendants Initially Retract Confessions</p>
<p>Truth Uncovered Through Repeated Interrogation</p>
<p>Sun Laowu, a native of Nantong residing in Qujia Bridge, Zhabei, was brutally murdered at his home on July 27th of this year (corresponding to June 2nd of the leap month in the old calendar) at 7 PM. The crime was perpetrated by his adopted son, Sun Liansheng, along with fellow villagers Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Lansheng, and Qiu Shuntao.  Following the act, Sun Liansheng and Qiu Shuntao fled to Nantong but were apprehended by Sun Xuewen (biological father), and Sun Xue Li, among others, who then handed them over to Shanghai authorities. The Fifth Precinct of the Municipal Police Bureau apprehended all the principal offenders.  After initial interrogation, all confessed fully.  Subsequently, they were transferred to the local court where Prosecutor Xu completed the investigation and filed a public indictment for premeditated murder.  Yesterday at 10 AM, Criminal Court President Shen Bingrong commenced the trial.  The defendants unexpectedly retracted their confessions and pleaded not guilty. The presiding judge summoned witnesses to the court for cross-examination, and Sun Liansheng was subjected to repeated questioning.  Ultimately, he confessed to the premeditated nature of the murder.  The trial concluded at 2 PM.  Due to the summer recess and the lack of a midday meal, the presiding judge provided the defendants with refreshments. As the detention center's lunch hour had passed, the trial was adjourned for further debate and sentencing.

<p>Three-Year-Old Child Dies from Severe Injuries</p>
<p>Chen Yinbao Denies Needle Pricks</p>
<p>Further Interrogation and Examination to Follow Autopsy</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Jing'an Temple Police Station dispatched Constable Yang Zaishan to escort 26-year-old Suzhou woman Chen Yinbao to the Special District Court's Criminal Court Two, presided over by Judge Sun Yuan for questioning.  Police Attorney Wang Yaotang stated that the Police Station is charging the defendant with severely beating her three-year-old son, Zhou Jishun, between the 28th and 30th of last month at 1192 Hart Road, resulting in his death.  The child's body has not yet been transported to the mortuary for autopsy, therefore a request is made for adjournment and further questioning.  Zhou Xinfa submitted a deposition, stating that he is a native of Chuansha, Pudong, earning a living by running a small shop.  The defendant, Chen Yinbao, is his wife, married for five years, cohabiting at 1192 Hart Road.  They have two sons, the elder died of illness at the age of three, the younger is currently three years old, namely Jishun.  He has been subjected to beatings by the defendant, leaving his body covered in bruises.  On the 25th of last month, he (Zhou) returned home ill and bedridden.  The defendant then punched and kicked Jishun, for five consecutive days, also using thread needles to prick Jishun's abdomen, causing severe injuries.  He witnessed the heartbreaking events, but due to being afflicted by illness, was unable to stop her, and could only order his apprentice to send Jishun to Baolong Hospital for medical treatment.  Doctors attempted to remove the needles.  Subsequently, his mother, out of love for her grandson, took Jishun out of the hospital and brought him to Chuansha for further medical treatment.  Eventually, due to severe injuries, he died within a few days.  Upon hearing the news, he was enraged and reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest the defendant.  Judge Sun asked Zhou where the child's body was located, and whether an examination had been conducted. Zhou replied that the body was in his hometown and had not been examined.  Zhou Xinfa's mother, Zhou Wangshi, aged 60, also stated that she resided in Chuansha.  After the defendant severely beat her grandson, her son sent apprentice Fu Jizu to send a letter to the village. She rushed to Baolong Hospital in Shanghai and witnessed doctors removing iron needles from her grandson's abdomen.  When questioned, defendant Chen Yinbao stated that she lightly disciplined her son because he bit her while she was sleeping, but did not prick his abdomen with a thread needle.  Furthermore, Jishun was her own son, and she would not bear to commit such an atrocity.  After reviewing the statements, Judge Sun ordered the defendant remanded in custody, and ordered Zhou Xinfa to transport the child's body to the mortuary on Fielun Road for examination.</p>

<p>Public Utilities Bureau Urges Installation of Public Tap</p>
<p>The houses in Fu'anli, Changan Road, Zhabei, originally used tap water, but the water was cut off due to a rent increase issue. The tenants are willing to draw river water and do not want to increase their burden. Last October, the owner, Qu Genji, took over the property. At that time, he originally planned to increase the rent and restore the water supply, but the tenants refused and demanded a rent reduction. Therefore, the water supply problem in the neighborhood has not been resolved. Recently, some tenants sent a letter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, stating that the lack of drinking water is detrimental to hygiene, and is especially dangerous in the event of a fire, requesting assistance. The bureau summoned the owner's representative and the rental accountant to inquire about the situation. After consideration, it was deemed reasonable that the owner was not responsible for the water supply, but it was inappropriate for the tenants to draw river water. Therefore, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was ordered to set up a public tap in the neighborhood, and to charge according to the vegetable stall water usage fee regulations recently approved by the municipal government for domestic water companies (i.e., 4 copper coins per bucket of water delivered to each household, 2 copper coins for half a bucket, and 1 copper coin reduction per bucket for those who fetch it themselves. Users can voluntarily pay monthly based on daily water consumption. Retail beverages are also available to provide relief.</p>

According to the last two counts, it was committed with another service soldier, Maoli. Maoli is now charged with using forged documents and will be tried by Anshi on the 29th of this month.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been unusually hot and humid for several days. Yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, dark clouds gathered in the northwest corner. In an instant, the northwest wind was very strong, pushing the dark clouds to the sky, which was unusually dark, threatening a downpour. The shops on the roads opened their electric lights for business. Before long, it rained heavily for about ten minutes. After the clouds dispersed and the rain stopped, the lights returned. After this empty battle formation, the wind blew softly, and people felt refreshed.</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Case of Mei Fei May Have a Settlement <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Adjourned to the 7th for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Zhao Tan Meiying, the wife of Zhao Guangzu, a native of Baoshan, residing at 139 Hart Road, previously hired lawyers Lu Qi and Zhao Zuwei to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Court against prostitute Mei Fei (i.e., Chen Junxia) and Hu Yongquan, jointly accusing them of seizing a Ford car, forcing the establishment of written agreements, forging private seals, and intending to commit fraud. The court had approved the motion and questioned the parties on the morning of the 7th of this month. Because both defendants had not appeared, the court ordered an adjournment and further questioning. Yesterday morning, the date for the continued questioning in this case arrived. No less than a hundred people from all walks of life came to the court to listen, about half of whom were women. The defendant Mei Fei, accompanied by her lawyer Shen Yushan, arrived at Criminal Court Two around 10 o'clock and sat in the third row of the audience seats. Her appearance was beautiful, her hair was cut short and reached her eyebrows, and she wore a purple-red flower walsha cheongsam with a white background.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Her eyebrows were locked in spring mountains, as if she could not bear her sorrow. However, because there were many trivial cases in the police station yesterday morning, this case was not called for questioning by the presiding judge Sun Yuanjun until 11:45. The defendants Mei Fei and Hu Yongquan then stood in the defendant's column, and the plaintiff Zhao Tan Meiying also arrived in court to await questioning. The plaintiff's attorneys, Zhao Zuwei and Lu Qi, stated that the defendant's attorney, Shen, told our attorney that there was hope of settlement in this case, so they requested that the questioning be adjourned for another seven days. If a settlement is reached, they will submit a motion to request the dismissal of the case at any time. After reviewing the report, Judge Sun ordered the case to be adjourned for questioning for another seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e204">French Concession Smashes Another Flower Gambling Den <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the wind of flower gambling in the French Concession has become increasingly serious. Gambling dens are densely distributed, and listening devices are everywhere. Multiple cases are being cracked down on every day. Although the police station has imposed severe penalties, it has not diminished at all. It is now reported that the French authorities have learned that the person in charge is Mr. Ma Pi Gao, a famous flower gambling king in Shanghai. An order has been issued to all subordinates to investigate and arrest him strictly and to crack down on the headquarters within a limited time to eliminate the roots. It is reported that Wang Bingrong, a woman, Zhang Zhushi, recently set up a listening device privately in the concession, inducing people to gamble. The constable learned about it and went to copy out the flower gambling notes and silver dollars and other items and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for investigation. First, the headhunter explained the previous situation. Wang and Zhu confessed without denying it. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced the two defendants to a fine of 80 yuan to be confiscated as a warning and asked where their headquarters was located. But the defendant has always refused to reveal the truth.</p>

Recently, due to the poor environment, he often talked about suicide and revealed it to others, so his family paid close attention to him. Unexpectedly, Xiong suddenly fled a few days ago and his whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday, his relatives reported to the water police station, stating that they feared that he had drowned himself in the Huangpu River, so they asked the police to pay attention to the body. The headhunter approved it.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Extortion and Assault Case by Hoodlums <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Trial Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Last month, near the Zhangjia Bridge by the Fenshui Temple in Zhabei, the Chengfa Niupi Factory was targeted by Jiangbei hoodlums for extortion. When they failed, these ruffians gathered over a hundred people and stormed the factory. They tied up the manager, a Cantonese named Dai Ying, and the workers (sixteen people were tied up on the spot), beat them, and completely destroyed the doors, windows, and miscellaneous items of the Chengfa and Tongliyuan (located very close to Chengfa) Niupi Factories. The factory reported this to the local police station, which immediately dispatched officers to the scene. They arrested seven ringleaders: Hong Yikuan, Dai Zhongfu, Liu Yongfu, Chen Wanyu, Sun Zitian, Cai Busheng, and Zhu Changshun. They were taken to the local court prosecutor's office for interrogation, where they confessed to the facts. The defendants were all ordered to be detained. Sun Zitian was released on bail. A lawsuit was filed with the criminal court, requesting a public trial. The main points of the indictment were as follows: the defendants Hong Yikuan, Dai Zhongfu, Liu Yongfu, etc., were all hoodlums who relied on their large gang to extort various leather factories in Zhangjia Bridge. Because the area was remote, no one dared to challenge them. Previously, they had extorted three yuan from Chengfa Factory. Not long after, they demanded another ten yuan. When the factory manager, Dai Ying, refused, they attempted to take the factory's leather as compensation, leading to a conflict. The gang then gathered over a hundred people and stormed the factory, engaging in violent assaults and destroying many doors, windows, and miscellaneous items. The injuries sustained by both sides were not reported. The indictment focused on the Chengfa Factory's charges of extortion, disruption of order, and property damage. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Judge Zhao opened the trial. The plaintiffs were represented by lawyers Sha Xunyi and Chao Kun, who presented their case. After the judge took his seat, he ordered the detained Hong Yikuan to be brought to the stand. He was 26 years old, from Funing, and worked as a rust scraper on ships. Dai Zhongfu testified that he was 24 years old, from Xinghua, and a laborer. Liu Yongfu testified that he was 27 years old, from Huaicheng, and sold flatbreads. Chen Wanyu testified that he was 42 years old, from Huaicheng, and worked as a rickshaw puller. Sun Zitian testified that he was 26 years old, from Funing. Cai Busheng testified that he was 24 years old, from Yancheng. The testimonies of these individuals were mutually contradictory. Zhu Changshun testified that he was 23 years old, from Yancheng, and was currently recruiting soldiers at the North Railway Station. He presented a triangular recruiting flag made of white bamboo cloth, along with symbols. The judge asked him which army unit he was recruiting for. Zhu replied that it was the First Division of the Army Training Regiment. The judge asked where the division headquarters was stationed. Zhu replied that it was currently at the front lines and claimed to have previously served in the military, now on a long leave to visit family. The judge asked where he had served in the military. Zhu replied that it was the Third Battalion, Eighteenth Regiment, Third Division of the Hunan Army. The judge asked who had ordered him to recruit soldiers. Zhu replied that it was Deputy Officer Wang, also known as Battalion Commander Wang. The judge asked where Wang lived. Zhu replied that Wang lived in the alley behind the Jiaotong Hotel at the Hanqiao Bridge at the North Railway Station. The judge asked how much he was paid each month for recruiting soldiers. Zhu replied twelve yuan. The judge asked if he was impersonating soldiers. Zhu replied that he was not. The judge asked when he started recruiting soldiers. Zhu replied in August of this year. The judge pointed out that he had been in custody since August, so how could he be recruiting in August? Zhu was speechless. The judge ordered the items to be kept on file to be investigated further. Then, the judge ordered the plaintiff, Dai Ying, to the stand. He was 54 years old, from Nanhai, Guangdong, and was the manager of the leather factory. He testified that they (referring to Hong Yikuan, Dai Zhongfu, and Liu Yongfu) had repeatedly extorted two yuan, three yuan, and seven yuan from the factory. This time, they demanded another ten yuan, which he refused. They then gathered over a hundred people and stormed the factory, tying up and assaulting him and the workers, and destroying the doors, windows, and miscellaneous items. At the time, their numbers were so great that they surrounded both factories. The judge asked how many people were in the two factories. Dai replied that the two factories had only thirty-two workers, including children. Witnesses Guo Youcheng, Hu Dayin, and Zhou Guangfa testified that the gang had surrounded the factory and destroyed the doors and windows. After this testimony, the judge invited Prosecutor Zhao Zhiqiu to present his arguments. Sun Zitian's lawyer then stood up to defend Sun, requesting that he be declared innocent. The plaintiffs' lawyers, Sha Xunyi and Chao Kun, spoke in turn. The plaintiff pointed out in court that Chen Wanyu had tied him up at the time, and that Sun Zitian had tied up the workers. The judge then announced that the arguments in the case were concluded and that a verdict would be announced later. The defendants were returned to custody, and Sun Zitian remained on bail pending further notice. The court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Abusing His Son from a Previous Marriage <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>How Can Yuan Zhensheng Be So Heartless?</p>
<p>Yuan Zhensheng, who lives at 128 Kenenghai Road in the Public Concession and works at the tram company, had a son named Jinzhong, now seven years old, from his deceased first wife. Two years ago, Zhensheng remarried a woman named Zhou as his second wife, who gave birth to another son, whom they doted on. As a result, Zhensheng discriminated against his son from his first marriage. Incited by Zhou, Jinzhong was often beaten by his father. Neighbors often heard his cries of pain and were indignant. Yesterday, Zhensheng returned home from the company, and Zhou told him that Jinzhong had secretly taken money and spent it outside. Zhensheng, without investigating whether it was true, immediately beat Jinzhong severely and then burned his neck with a cigarette, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain and cry miserably. Neighbors, hearing the sound, went to see what had happened and all felt that Zhensheng was deliberately mistreating his son from his first marriage, showing extreme cruelty. They immediately reported the matter to the Huisi police station, bringing Zhensheng, Zhou, and Jinzhong for investigation. The neighbors were willing to testify. The police chief, after learning the details, found that Zhensheng's abuse of his son from his first marriage was indeed wrong. However, Jinzhong was still young and unable to support himself. Zhensheng and his wife Zhou were reprimanded and ordered to take the child back and raise him properly, with a warning that any further abuse would be severely punished.</p>

<p>Madam Du Zhang Severely Injured</p>
<p>Du Panlin, from Shaoxing, is currently 41 years old and works as a shop assistant at the Renhe Yuan Soy Sauce Shop near the Lao Zha Bridge. He married Zhang, also 41 years old, when he was young. They live in a flat on the upper floor of a building at a certain number in the Xu Family Garden in the Tangjia Alley nearby. An old Jiangbei man named Lao Chong Bobo lives in the kitchen. He has no permanent job, so he often faces financial difficulties and borrows money from neighbors. Once he borrows, he never returns it. The day before yesterday, he asked Zhang to borrow four yuan but was refused. He had been cursing for days. Until last night, he was still grumbling downstairs. Zhang could no longer tolerate it and questioned him. Lao Chong Bobo became enraged and used a knife to slash her four times: once on the head, once on the left shoulder, once on the back, and once on the abdomen. The cuts were half an inch deep, and blood flowed profusely. She fell to the ground in extreme pain. The sub-landlord reported the incident to police station 102, and the police arrested the perpetrator and took him to the Huisi police station for handling. The injured woman was taken to Tongren Hospital by ambulance and then transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Her life is in danger.</p>

<p>Recently, the French Concession police authorities have been very strict with security within the concession and preventive measures against thieves. Detectives are spread out like stars, and several new teams have been organized, each with specific responsibilities. Furthermore, Mr. Huang Jinrong, a senior consultant, has recruited several hundred special volunteers to patrol various locations. This has made it impossible for petty thieves to succeed. As a result, robbery cases have been rare in the past two months.</p>

She claimed her name was Chen A'e, thirteen years old, from Ningbo. Her parents were deceased, and she only had a grandmother. Today, she followed a soy sauce shop apprentice named A'quan on a ferry to Pudong for fun. A'quan disappeared, so she did not know the way and could not return. The child was wearing a short black cotton shirt and striped cloth trousers, with cropped hair. Because the district police could not determine her address, she was kept to wait for her family to claim her.</p>

From late September of last year to February 14 of this year, which falls under the supervisory period, the funds raised by various customs branches, except for the losses during the political changes from December 6 of last year to January 23 of this year, should be handled by former Supervisor He to ensure the integrity of the debt.

<h3 id="e214">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Greetings, I have just read the article "Recent Events at the China Merchants Bureau - Continued Operation of the Navigation School" in today's news section of your newspaper. It states that "the teaching staff of the navigation specialty first sent representatives to meet with Cai, requesting that the status quo be maintained, and that Cai immediately presented it to the Ministry of Communications, stating that the teachers and students of the school had come to the Bureau to request that the merger be avoided," etc. After reading this, I was very surprised. After the teaching staff of the navigation specialty received the official letter from Acting Principal Cai regarding the merger of this school with the Wusong Merchant Marine School, they immediately followed the instructions in the letter and completed all handover procedures for the school's affairs in preparation for the transfer. However, because the staff had not been paid their salaries for the four months from May to August, and repeated requests for payment had been unsuccessful, they were forced to send several representatives to meet with Acting Principal Cai on the 18th and 19th of this month to demand payment of their salaries so that they could prepare to return home. Regarding the school's affairs, they immediately stated that they had completed the handover according to the letter and were waiting for the transfer. There was no request to maintain the status quo or any other negotiations. This is the true situation of the meeting with Acting Principal Cai on that day. As for the students' movement to protect the school, the declaration issued, and the negotiations with Acting Principal Cai, it was entirely the action of the entire student body, and the staff did not participate in any of it. The information in your newspaper is likely due to incorrect rumors. We are sending this letter to request a correction and to have our letter published to avoid misunderstandings. With best wishes, the entire teaching staff of the China Merchants School Navigation Specialty, August 21.</p>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, I have just read the section in your newspaper today regarding the case of Deng Zhulan from Pingyang and her brother-in-law, Wen Ming, being accused of abduction by her cousin, Deng Jing. It states that "after the woman came to Shanghai, she was admitted to Datong University," etc. After checking, our school has no such person as Deng Zhulan among the newly admitted students this time. The information in your newspaper is not consistent with the facts. We are sending this letter to request a correction. Best wishes, Datong University, August 20. Sincerely, I have just read the local news section of your newspaper, which stated that "our association is a disguised lottery and was searched by the French police," etc., which is not consistent with the facts. Our association opened at the beginning of this month and was registered with the French Consulate in Shanghai. We have raised 100,000 yuan in capital and aim to promote savings. To generate interest, we hold periodic draws. Although we were mistakenly searched by the French police yesterday, the items have been returned in full today, and we are operating as usual. We are concerned that this may cause misunderstandings, and we request that you correct the information. To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, Yongnian Savings Association, August 21.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Black Drama <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Changxi</p>
<p>Besides music, the art form that best expresses the strong national consciousness of black people is painting and drama.</p>
<p>In painting, they do not yet have independent ability, because painting is an aristocratic pursuit. It cannot be successful without sufficient economic resources and ample time for practice. Therefore, even if they achieve something, they cannot escape the influence of white people.</p>
<p>Apart from the occasional exhibition of works by black people who have resided in France in the past, in the United States there are a few young writers who have been fostered by grants and awards from a certain society. However, their expressive power in painting is fundamentally weak. Apart from taking the lives of wandering black people or street performers as themes to express black life, there is no other mature national consciousness in painting than in literature.</p>
<p>In drama, because their skills in creating scripts are relatively weak, their achievements in acting outweigh the work of playwrights. Therefore, there are black members in all kinds of theater troupes in the United States. On the one hand, they have a talent for acting; on the other hand, to express the life and suffering of modern black people, it is impossible without them. Therefore, many themes in American dramas use black people as the background, because black people cannot be separated from real life in the United States, and the lower-class life of black people is a member of the flourishing American civilization.</p>
<p>The most famous actor and director is Paul Robeson. He is not only the first outstanding talent among black people, but also a well-known figure in contemporary American theater history. The most famous is his staging of the play "Othello." After its success in England and Paris, his position in the United States has increased. He is only a 35-year-old young man. His unique success is especially due to his singing and expressions that contain the spirit of the Negro race. Because he is a lucky man of the times, he became famous for acting in two plays by the American playwright Eugene O'Neill. He studied at Latin Kings University, so his acting skills can sharply express the talent of black people.</p>
<p>In addition, the film industry, which has been popular in the United States in recent years and has almost conquered the world, cannot escape the influence of black people. In addition to adopting black people in the themes and actors, they also have organizations that are completely directed and played by black people. King Vidor, the creator of the most famous "The Big Parade," caused a stir in the United States and Germany with his film "Hallelujah," starring only black people. In order to completely and realistically depict the lives of black people in "Hallelujah," Vidor personally went to the black areas of the southern United States to select excellent actors. All the faces, postures, songs and dances, and the consciousness of the masses can fully express the entire life of the black people. Therefore, in the three major elements of American civilization, music ("Gazz"), black people have injected the blood of their nation, making American national music completely black. Although black people cannot conquer the film that represents modern American civilization, the style of film cannot escape the black background.</p>
<p>In the production of scripts, due to the times, their success is not as great as in novels and poetry. Most of them are simple descriptions of the lives of black people. Moreover, because there are many abbreviations and dialects in the unique English of black people, as well as the infiltration of foreign languages, it is difficult to gain the sympathy and understanding of non-black audiences in the performance. Only by staging them in theaters unique to black people can the themes be used as tools to awaken national consciousness.</p>
<p>However, in the development process of black drama, the most noteworthy are Jonathan Matheus, who won the "Opportunity Magazine" drama award in 1926 with the one-act play "The Recruiters," and Ceorgia Douglas Johnson, who won the first place in the magazine's drama competition in 1927 with "Plumes."</p>
<p>In "Plumes," he very deeply portrays the tragedy of a woman who gets sick. It is a personal tragedy, not about black people, but the short one-act play is full of emotions that make people have to sympathize.</p>
<p>But "The Recruiters" is different. Although it is also a short one-act play, it can deeply express that after Lincoln freed the slaves, their lives were still subject to disguised slavery. A typical 73-year-old nanny grandmother can only sing when life is not good, "No one knows the hardships I have encountered, only Jesus knows..." And the grandson, a 23-year-old Negro youth, has to admit the needs of the recruiters of the Northern Arsenal for the sake of life, because the white recruiter said to the young man, "Don't lose the good opportunity of your life, there is good money and a good career waiting for you." And he can make his grandmother's life stable and his wife beautiful, so he has to admit it.</p>
<p>In short, the expression of national consciousness in black art is becoming sharper day by day. To restore their Greater Afro-America, it is necessary to have the stimulant of national character in art.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Commemorating the Poet Huang Zhenxia <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Qiuyuan</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my brother Fu Yanchang casually reported to me that he didn't know the whereabouts of Huang Zhenxia and said that Huang Zhenxia had gone to the front, and his life and death were uncertain. Those who have even a slight acquaintance with this unfortunate poet Huang Zhenxia will inevitably express infinite sympathy and think of the sadness of life being like a sojourn and fate being difficult to disobey. Yesterday, my brother Lu Mengshu came to my house and talked about Huang Zhenxia. We couldn't help but feel sad for each other. Huang Zhenxia, where is Huang Zhenxia?</p>
<p>Today is Sunday. The first page of the "Shenbao Pictorial Weekly" attached to the Shenbao publishes a photograph of "The Second Cavalry Division of the Central Teaching Corps waiting at Pukou Railway Station on August 1st to go to the front line." From that blurry and dim photograph, we see a young man in military uniform riding a horse, his thin figure, and delicate face. Could it be our poet Huang Zhenxia's last image?</p>
<p>This kind of, that kind of, vague and sorrowful emotion makes us feel the changes of life and the dangers of fate. We commemorate our poet Huang Zhenxia today, even though it may be a bit early. Even though Huang Zhenxia may not have encountered the situation we imagined, this little bit of unfortunate news is enough to make us feel something in our hearts.</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>The readers of this journal may not have forgotten our poet, Huang Zhenxia. In the past, this journal published many of his articles on art history and culture. His powerful writing, vigorous thinking, and beautiful words may still be in the memory of the general readers. Today, what we commemorate is precisely this our poet, this close friend of our journal, Huang Zhenxia.</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>This was three years ago. In an autumn, on North Sichuan Road, known as "Mysterious Street," in the Cantonese Nan Restaurant, in a small room, filled with more than a dozen people, here, I first met our poet, his delicate face, thin figure, crisp Beijing accent, gentle demeanor, at a glance, you could tell he was from a prominent family. He was the youngest and most silent in the group.</p>
<p>He was a student of history, a student of art, and also, he was a poet.</p>
<p>The unfortunate event began like this: his mother passed away from appendicitis two years ago, leaving behind our poet and his sister. The hustle and bustle of the metropolis made lonely people feel even lonelier, and wandering people feel even more adrift. At this time, we saw his poems and articles in various publications such as "Art World" and "Athens."</p>
<p>In the Athens Monthly, Huang Zhenxia published many new poems. His poems have a magnificent, heroic, and unrestrained spirit—in our new poetry world, he can be regarded as unique and unparalleled. From these, those, the poems he left behind, it is already a fact that Huang Zhenxia is our poet, his poems are as majestic as Byron's, but the position he has achieved in the Chinese poetry world—is only our poet, our Byron. The poet's achievements, where has there ever been genius? Fate is truly in control.</p>
<p>Huang Zhenxia was also a nationalist. The essays on art published in "Art World" are full of rich and sound national thought. He was a pioneer of nationalist literature and art. He not only published essays on national literature and art, but also was a creator and practitioner of national literature and art. Many of the poems and novels he left behind are not only full of magnificent and unrestrained temperament, but also contain a large amount of national color. They are typical representative plays of our nationalist literature and art.</p>
<p>National passion, heroic aspirations, and the sorrow of reality led our poet to join the Central Military Academy. We were hoping that this was the dawn of the beginning of his life. But because of the turmoil in the Central Plains, our poet had to embark on a military vehicle and head to the front. He was in the cavalry, on the battlefield in the Guide area. In the battle of Guide, our poet may be among the many names who died in battle. This is the situation, this may be the end of our poet.</p>
<p>Our poet has an unspeakable wandering life experience. He left behind a younger sister, who is currently being cared for by Mr. Zhang Ruogu. He was most friendly with Zhu Yingpeng, Fu Yanchang, Lu Mengshu, and others. He was a Shanghai native of Guangdong origin, and was twenty-one years old.</p>

<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Edited by Lu Mengshu</p>
<p>Published by Wenhua Fine Arts Publishing and Printing Company</p>
<p>It is really shameful that Chinese people seem to be completely unfamiliar with this art—the emerging art of film—as if there is a thick curtain separating them. Although it is said that China also has so-called domestic films, its history has been around for eighteen years (from 1913 to now). However, China's so-called domestic films are nothing more than "pictures in the painting are real, about to come out" like gourds, printing men and women and scenery on film to add another item to the sales market for imported goods. What is film? They still don't understand at all. Because what they understand, on the viewer's side, is nothing more than "pictures in the painting are really real, about to come out." On the producer's side, it is nothing more than a kind of fresh—fashionable—business product like a revolving lantern, in which there are active forms in the painting, that can coax children and deceive rural people to get big money. What is the central consciousness of film art? In fact, they—viewers and producers—are still at a loss, and still don't understand at all.</p>
<p>Because of this lack of understanding, China's so-called domestic films do not know what they have become, and are terribly deformed. This is not my intention to ridicule the viewers and producers of China's so-called domestic films here. This is really a fact that has been shown to us for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Mengshu is one of the people who has worked the hardest to attack this point. He showed us very clearly in his past work in the eighteen issues of "Silver Star". Now, he is planning to charge again, and the "Film" monthly magazine, which has determined its purpose with all its strength, has appeared.</p>
<p>We should thank him for supporting him for so diligently connecting a group of writers in this era to make this great contribution within the scope of film, and for providing sincere enlightenment and encouragement to the producers of China's so-called domestic films, especially for the sincerity of his attitude towards the readers of the "Film" monthly magazine.</p>
<p>He said in the editor's afterword in the second issue of "Film" monthly magazine, "When I first set the editorial plan for this magazine, I wanted to make it a complete publication in all aspects. However, now it is impossible. Because, in the current state of wavering thoughts, young people feel at a loss. If a magazine of the times inconsistently publishes contradictory remarks, it will confuse young readers, and then the consequences will be endless, and the editor will be equivalent to the culprit."</p>
<p>He also said, "I plan to publish a "Nationalist Film Movement Special Issue" in the fourth issue of this magazine to call on people to recognize the central consciousness of this emerging art. I think this is what I should do for our nation."</p>
<p>That's right, advocating nationalism is what we should do for our nation. Moreover, in this era of national suffering</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>of the times, in this era of declining literature and art, the advocacy of "nationalism" is the most important and urgent thing we should do for our nation first. Because the current crisis in China is that the people have no national consciousness, and are a pile of loose sand with no whole force of unity. They cannot unite internally, and they cannot resist strong enemies externally. The so-called "people are knives and cutting boards, and I am fish and meat." The people of the whole country, like a pile of loose sand, have no national consciousness, so there is no whole force of unity. Since there is no whole force of unity, our nation and national rights will be like the donkey that Shandong people buy donkey meat from, and people can cut off any piece they want. We Chinese have such a current crisis, and we should responsibly hurry up and work hard for the national purpose, which is "nationalism."</p>
<p>We advocate "nationalism", of course, starting from literature and art, because this can determine the center of thought, this can save the decline of literature and art, and this can make all the people recognize national consciousness and achieve a whole force of unity to achieve the self-determination period. Since film is an emerging art, then "nationalism" should be advocated in a film publication. It is true as Mr. Lu Mengshu said, "This is what I should do for our nation."</p>
<p>Sure enough, Mr. Lu Mengshu really has come to do his will, that is, to "completely overturn the original editorial plan, and summarize it to the unity of thought." That is to say, what he showed us is already in the third issue of the "Film" monthly magazine that he edited. In the third issue of the "Film" monthly magazine, the first arrow was shot at the hearts of the producers, in the "Our Words" talk—</p>
<p>It is not to seek correction from the enlightened, nor to seek appreciation from the intellectual class, but to blow a conch shell in the newspaper when it is released, deceive ignorant women and children, make a noise in the lower class society, make money and then do it again, and then find a way to make money. There must always be a way to think of, and it is okay to continue one after another until more than ten sequels. This is also the usual trick of Chinese filmmakers, and it is also the only way for Chinese films.</p>
<p>Although film is one of the enterprises, it is always art, and it cannot be taken casually to be a cover for cheating money, and it cannot be taken casually to deceive the ignorant and promote corruption. Unfortunately, Chinese filmmakers have committed these two problems...</p>
<p>For more than ten years, the original intention has always remained unchanged, and it has become the declining period of Chinese films today.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu has always been bold in speaking, and in this speech, he is especially stern and upright, and his needles are sharp. However, there is always a reason why Chinese films have declined, so he also said—</p>
<p>"In short, this is entirely because thought has lost its center, and culture has no way out, so that all arts have entered a period of decline..."</p>
<p>Yes, because thought has lost its center and culture has no way out, so that all arts have entered a period of decline, so it is not only film, but other things are also the same. Therefore, "If we writers and artists do not urgently catch up and strive to take on this major responsibility, we will not be able to save this crisis in our lifetime." However, how can this major responsibility be taken on with effort? Oh, Mr. Lu told us in the article "Our Understanding of Film Art"—</p>
<p>Today, in this era of suffering in China, we should abandon ourselves and strive to be soldiers fighting for the whole nation. People's will is to survive. We Chinese should have the will to survive for the whole nation."</p>
<p>The literary and artistic movement of "nationalism" is to take consistent action on different fields to work hard on the work, that is, to gather writers, musicians, and other artists, concentrate their minds, unite their forces, and work hard on the "nationalist literary and artistic movement."</p>
<p>For this, Mr. Lu wanted "our understanding of film art", and this "our understanding of film art" is to demand the new life of our film practitioners today, today's new life is to abandon the previous errors in understanding of film and awaken and have a new and correct understanding. This kind of new and correct understanding is the artistic ideological center of "nationalism".</p>
<p>This third issue of the "Film" monthly magazine is sparing no effort in advocating "nationalism". There are too many things that can be said here. The editor's obvious point of expectation for the compatriots' physique is especially admirable. He said on the second page, "Domestic films, in terms of women, have already made people see success... But the requirements of the times are to be fully possessed of male beauty." And on page 45, he said, "In this period of national revival movement, we must pay special attention to the nation's lively and perseverance spirit, and sound physique, because with these two can we have the power of resistance and all actions, which is an urgent need of the nation."</p>
<p>As for the novelty of the layout of this publication, the excellence of the materials, the beauty of the pictures and photos, and the richness of the fun, I dare say that it is unique in film publications. However, after reading this third issue, I still hope that Mr. Lu will publish the fourth issue "Nationalist Film Movement Special Issue" sooner.</p>
